The State of Himachal Pradesh came to be created, with effect from\n\n25.1.1971. Consequent upon the creation of the State of Himachal Pradesh,\n\nemployees engaged by the corporate sector, on their retirement, were being paid\n\nprovident fund, under the provisions of the Employees’\nProvident Funds and\n\nMiscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952\n(hereinafter referred to as the\nProvident Fund\n\nAct\n). The Central Government framed the Employees’ Provident Funds Scheme,\n\n1995, whereby, it replaced the earlier statutory schemes, framed under the\n\nProvident Fund Act\n. This scheme was adopted for the corporate sector employees,\n\nengaged in the State of Himachal Pradesh.\n\n2. In order to extend better retiral benefits to these employees, the Himachal\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nPradesh Government framed another scheme on 29.10.1999 – the Himachal\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nSATISH KUMAR YADAV\n\nDate: 2016.09.28\n\n13:47:27 TLT\n\nReason:\n\nPradesh Corporate Sector Employees Pension (Family Pension, Commutation of\n\nPension and Gratuity) Scheme, 1999. In the present judgment, the instant scheme\nwill be referred to as ‘the 1999 Scheme’. A perusal of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ reveals\n\nthat its application extended to employees of some of the corporate bodies (-\n\nspecified in Annexure-I, appended to ‘the 1999 Scheme’) in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nThere were in all 20 corporate entities, named in Annexure-I. These corporate\n\nbodies functioned as independent entities, under the Departments of Industries,\n\nWelfare, Horticulture, Forest, Food and Supplies, Tourism, Town and Country\n\nPlanning, Housing and General Administration.\n\n3. Paragraph 2 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, provided for the zone of application of the\n\nsaid Scheme. It expressly provided, that the same would apply to only such of the\n\nemployees, “who opted for the benefit under the scheme”. It is necessary to\n\nexpressly notice, that paragraph 2 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ required, that the above\n\noption would be exercised by the employees in writing, in the format provided for the\n\nsame. This option, was required to be submitted within 30 days of the notification of\n\nthe scheme - by 27.11.1999. It was also provided in paragraph 2, that such of the\n\nemployees who failed to exercise any option, within the period provided for, for\n\nwhatever reason, would be deemed to have exercised their option, to be regulated\n\nby ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It is therefore apparent, that it was imperative for all\n\nconcerned employees, to express their option, to be governed by the Employees\n\nProvident Funds Scheme, 1995, in case the concerned employees, desired to avoid\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’. In case of the exercise of such option, the concerned employee\n\nwould continue to be governed by the Employees Provident Funds Scheme, 1995.\n\nFailing which, every employee, whether he opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’, or chose\n\nnot to make any option, would be regulated by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, with effect from\n\nthe day the scheme was made operational – 1.4.1999.\n4. It is also essential to indicate, that only those employees who had been\n\nappointed on regular basis, in corporate bodies, to which ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was\n\napplicable, could avail of the benefits of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. In other words,\n\nemployees engaged “...on part time basis, daily wage basis, piece-meal rate basis,\n\ncasual and contract basis...” were not entitled to opt for ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\n5. Paragraph 4 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ further provided, that those regular\n\nemployees, who were entitled to the benefits postulated by ‘the 1999 Scheme’,\n\nwould automatically forfeit their claim, to the employer’s contribution in their\n\nprovident fund account (including interest thereon), under the prevailing Employees\n\nProvident Funds Scheme, 1995, to the Government. The forfeited amount, would\n\ninclude the amount due and payable, under the Employees Provident Funds\n\nScheme, 1995, up to 31.3.1999. The forfeited amount in consonance with\n\nparagraph 5 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, was to be transferred to a corpus fund, to be\n\nadministered and managed by the Government of Himachal Pradesh. The\n\naforesaid corpus fund, was to be treated as the pension fund, for payment of\n\npension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\n6. It is of utmost relevance to mention, that paragraph 4 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’\n\nprovided as under:-\n\n“4. Regulation of Claim to Pension:-\n\nAny claim to pension shall be regulated by the provision of this scheme\nin force at the time when an employee retires or is retired or dies or is\ndischarged as the case may be subject to the following:-\n\n(a) The existing employees of the Corporation as on 1.4.99 shall\nhave the option either to elect the pension scheme or to continue under\nexisting Provident Fund scheme.\n\n(b) The existing employees who opt for Pension Scheme shall\nautomatically forfeit their claim to employer’s share of CPF including\ninterest thereon to the State Government as well as other claims under\nCPF Schemes by whatsoever name called in respect of all past\naccumulations upto 31.3.1999. The amount of their subscriptions to the\nfund alongwith interest (excluding employer’s share and interest\nthereon) shall be transferred to GPF account to be allotted and\nmaintained by the concerned Corporate Sector Organisation as per\nRules adopted by them”.\n\nIt is apparent from the above extract, that even though ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was to\n\ntake effect from 1.4.1999 (- under paragraph 1(3) of ‘the 1999 Scheme’), a claim for\n\npension by an employee governed by the above scheme, would arise only at the\n\ntime of the employee’s retirement, on attaining the age of superannuation, or when\n\nhe was retired from service by the employer, or in case of his death in harness. This\n\nis how, the appellant-State views the above provision (detailed submissions, are\n\nbeing noticed separately).\n\n7. It is not disputed, that regular employees of corporate bodies, to whom ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’ was applicable, had opted in writing (or were deemed to have opted)\n\nto be governed by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, or alternatively, had been engaged on regular\n\nbasis after the induction of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ but before ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was\n\nrepealed (- on 2.12.2004).\n\n8. While adjudicating upon the controversy, it is important to point out, that for\n\nthe implementation of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, permission was sought from the Regional\n\nProvident Fund Commissioner, Shimla, for the transfer of the accumulated provident\n\nfund corpus, to the proposed pension fund under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It is also\n\nrelevant to notice, that the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, through a\n\ncommunication dated 23.2.2000, declined to accord the above permission, because\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’ included only regular employees. Part time, daily wage, piece\n\nrate, casual and contract employees, were not covered by ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\nAccording to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, there was no provision\n\nunder the\nProvident Fund Act\n, to exclude a part of the employees, from the purview\nof the\nProvident Fund Act\n. The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner was of the\n\nview, that permission sought by the State Government could be accorded, only if all\n\nemployees of the concerned corporate bodies, were to be regulated by the\n\nsubstituting scheme (– ‘the 1999 Scheme’). The Regional Provident Fund\n\nCommissioner accordingly, through his communication dated 23.2.2000, advised the\n\nconcerned corporate bodies, to continue to comply with the provisions of the\n\nProvident Fund Act\n, in respect of all their employees. The above communication of\n\nthe Regional Provident Fund Commissioner, was superseded by another, dated\n\n11.9.2001, addressed by the Additional Central Provident Fund Commissioner\n\n(Pension), to the Secretary to the Government of India (with copy to the Regional\n\nProvident Fund Commissioner, Himachal Pradesh). It was pointed out, that a\n\nperusal of the aforesaid communication would reveal, that out of the concerned\n\ncorporate bodies, almost all were fully owned by the State or the Central\n\nGovernment, and the share capital of the general public in the remaining, was less\n\nthan one per cent. It was therefore, that the concerned corporate bodies were found\n\nto be eligible for the exemption, and were accordingly exempted from the\n\napplicability of the\nProvident Fund Act\n. It is apparent, that the communication dated\n\n11.9.2001 clarified, that as the corporate bodies fell within the ambit of Section 16(1)\n\n(b) of the\nProvident Fund Act\n, it would not be applicable to the concerned\n\nestablishments in the State of Himachal Pradesh, with effect from 1.4.1999.\n\n9. The above communication dated 11.9.2001, came to be endorsed by the\n\nUnion Minister of Labour, on 17.9.2001. The observations recorded in the order of\n\nthe Union Minister are extracted hereunder:\n\n“I have had the matter examined. It has been, noted from the Notification of\nthe State Government dated 29.10.1999 that all regular employees of these\nundertakings are entitled to pension, commutation of pension, gratuity as\napplicable to the State Govt. Employees of Himachal Pradesh. In such\ncircumstances the EPF & MP Act, 1952 shall not apply. The Pension would\nbe discharged by the Himachal Pradesh Government in terms of Section\n16(1)(b). These establishments would be out of the purview of the Act from\nthe date the Notification has come into force.”\n\nIn view of the factual position narrated herein above, the provisions of the\nProvident\n\nFund Act\nwere not in any way an obstacle, to the operation of ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\nAs such, ‘the 1999 Scheme’ became operational, with effect from 1.4.1999. At the\n\ninstant juncture, it would suffice to record, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ remained\n\noperational till it was repealed, by a notification date 2.12.2004.\n\n10. After the implementation of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, a high level committee was\n\nconstituted by the Finance Department of the State Government, on 21.1.2003. The\n\nsaid committee was comprised of four managing directors of state public sector\n\nundertakings and corporations. The high level committee was entrusted with the\n\ntask of examining, the financial viability of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. The committee\n\nsubmitted its report on 15.11.2003. Briefly stated, the high level committee arrived\n\nat the conclusion, that the pension scheme for regular employees of corporate\n\nbodies, given effect to under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, would not be financially viable on a\n\nself-sustaining basis. One of the observations recorded in the report of the high\n\nlevel committee was, with reference to the Himachal Road Transport Corporation. It\n\nwas pointed out, that the pension fund cash flow chart (year-wise) revealed, that in\n\ncase new appointments were not made against retirees, it would have extremely\n\ngrave financial consequences, inasmuch as, after the year 2009-10, the income by\n\nway of income tax, as well as, the contribution to the pension fund would continue to\n\nreduce, whereas pension payment expenditure, would continue to increase. It was\n\nexpected, that by the year 2015-16, the balance amount left with the Himachal Road\nTransport Corporation Pension Fund, would be reduced to approximately Rs.10.82\n\ncrores, whereas the pension liability of the retired employees of the Himachal Road\n\nTransport Corporation, for the said year, would be approximately Rs.14.56 crores.\n\nAccordingly, it was inferred, that from the year 2015-16 onwards, it would not be\n\npossible to make payments, towards the recurring pension liability. The report also\n\ndetermined the viability of the scheme, with reference to the Himachal Road\n\nTransport Corporation, even if the staff strength is kept at the same level, as was\n\nthen prevalent (- in 2003). The instant analysis resulted in the deduction, that the\n\npension contribution would be slightly more, as against the available pension fund of\n\nRs.10.82 crores. In case the staff strength was maintained at the same level, the\n\npension fund balance would be Rs.15.76 crores. Keeping in mind, the approximate\n\npension liability of Rs.14.56 crores for the year 2015-16, it was inferred, that the\n\nfinancial liability towards pension for the following year, i.e., 2016-17 would not be\n\nmet, out of the pension fund. It was therefore infrerred, that the payment of pension\n\nto regular employees of the concerned corporate bodies, could not be paid and\n\nsustained, out of the pension fund contemplated under ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\nAccordingly, the high powered committee recorded its conclusions as under:\n\n“In view of the above “the committee” is of the view that the pension scheme\nfor Corporate Sector employees based on contribution by the State\nGovernment will not be viable on a self sustaining basis mainly due to the\nfollowing reasons:-\n\ni). Uncertainty in the rate of interest regime.\nii). Declining recruitment in the Corporate Sector would deplete the\n\nsize of the corpus to be created and it would be difficult to honour\nliabilities accruing after 10-12 years.\n\niii). The pension plan envisages payment of pension to Corporate\nSector employees as is being paid to the Government employees.\n\nGovernment employees at present are entitled to pension @ 50% of the\nbasic pay last drawn with linkage to ADA. This return does not appear\nto be possible from the pension fund proposed to be created for\ncorporate sector employees.”\nAt the instant juncture, it would also be necessary to mention that, as is apparent\n\nfrom the submissions advanced on behalf of the State Government, three factors\n\nprimarily weighed with it for reconsidering the continuation of ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\nFirstly, uncertainty in the rate of interest regime; secondly, decline in recruitment in\n\nthe corporate sector; and thirdly, on account of the fact that the\n\nrespondent-employees would be entitled to pension at the rate of 50% of the basic\n\npay last drawn, with linkage to an additional dearness allowance. And as such, it\n\nwas not possible for the pension fund, to cater to the payment towards pension,\n\nunder ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It would also be relevant to mention, that besides the\n\nabove three reasons depicted in the committee’s report, the Cabinet Memorandum\n\ndated 12.10.2004, expressly took into consideration the poor financial health of the\n\nconcerned corporations, and the current financial health of the State Government.\n\nBoth the above factors also indicated, that it was not possible for the State\n\nGovernment to take upon itself, the financial burden of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. And,\n\nthere were also more pressing alternative claims. It was submitted, that as on\n\n31.3.2014, the cumulative losses of Government owned corporations, stood at\n\nRs.2,819.86 crores. The aforesaid Cabinet Memorandum was appended to the\n\nspecial leave petition, as Annexure P-4. The Cabinet in its meeting held on\n\n29.11.2004, also approved, that the Government would be supportive of efforts by\n\nindividual Government owned corporations, for setting up their own pensionary\n\nscheme(s).\n\n11. After considering the report of the high level committee, the State Government\n\ntook a decision on 29.11.2004 to repeal ‘the 1999 Scheme’. While repealing ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’, it was decided, that regular employees who had retired from\ncorporate bodies, during the period of the subsistence of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ from\n\n1999 to 2004, would not be affected. For the implementation of the decision of the\n\nState Government dated 29.11.2004, a notification dated 2.12.2004 was issued,\n\nrepealing ‘the 1999 Scheme’. A number of employees who had been deprived of\n\nthe benefit of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ by the notification dated 2.12.2004, challenged the\n\nrepeal notification, by filing a number of writ petitions, before the High Court of\n\nHimachal Pradesh, at Shimla (hereinafter referred to as the High Court). By the\n\nimpugned common order dated 19.12.2013, the High Court allowed all the writ\n\npetitions. The final determination of the High Court, is apparent from the following\n\nconclusions recorded by it:\n\n“78. There is no merit in the contention of learned Advocate General that the\nscheme could not be implemented due to financial crunch. The State was\naware of the financial implication at the time of issuance of notification dated\n29.10.1999. It is the sovereign responsibility of the State to garner revenue to\nmake welfare measures, including payment of pensionery/retiral benefits.\n\n79. It cannot be gathered from the plain language that either expressly or by\nimplication notification dated 2.12.2004 would apply retrospectively.\n\n80. Accordingly, in view of the analysis and discussion made hereinabove,\nall the writ petitions are allowed. The cut-off date 2.12.2004 is declared ultra\nvires. Notification dated 2.12.2004 is read down to save it from\nunconstitutionality, irrationality, arbitrariness or unreasonableness by including\nthe petitioners and similarly situated employees also, who had become\nmembers of the scheme notified on 29.10.1999 and have retired after\n2.12.2004 and those employees who were already in service when the\npension scheme was notified on 29.10.1999 and had become members of\nthat scheme and shall retire hereinafter, for the purpose of pensionery\nbenefits after applying the principles of severability. The Regional Provident\nFund Commissioner, Shimla is directed to transfer the entire amount of the\nCPF to a corpus fund to be administered and maintained by the Government\nof Himachal Pradesh in the Finance Department including upto date interest,\nwithin a period of two weeks. Thereafter, the Pension Sanctioning Authority is\ndirected to sanction the pension/gratuity/commutation of pension after proper\nscrutiny of the cases forwarded by the concerned Public Sector Undertaking\nand issue pension payment order to Pension Disbursing Authority strictly as\nper para 6 of the scheme notified on 29.10.1999 with interest @ 9% per\nannum, within a period of 12 weeks from today.”\n12. Dissatisfied with the judgment rendered by the High Court, dated 19.12.2013,\n\nthe State of Himachal Pradesh has approached this Court, challenging the common\n\nimpugned judgment dated 19.12.2003.\n\n13. Leave granted.\n\n14. The first contention advanced at the hands of Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior\n\ncounsel for the appellants, was premised on the proposition, that the State\n\nGovernment which had promulgated ‘the 1999 Scheme’, was well within its rights to\n\nrepeal the same, for good and sufficient reasons. It was submitted, that it stands\n\nestablished on the record of this case, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was not financially\n\nviable, inasmuch as, it could not be characterized as a self-sustaining scheme. It\n\nwas asserted, that the determination of the State Government to scrap ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, on the basis that the Scheme was not financially viable, was legal and\n\nbonafide.\nIn order to canvass the instant proposition, learned counsel, relied on\n\nState of Punjab v. Amar Nath Goyal\n, (2005) 6 SCC 754, and invited the Court’s\n\nattention, to the following observations recorded therein:\n\n“25. The only question, which is relevant and needs consideration, is whether\nthe decision of the Central and State Governments to restrict the revision of\nthe quantum of gratuity as well as the increased ceiling of gratuity consequent\nupon merger of a portion of dearness allowance into dearness pay reckonable\nfor the purpose of calculating gratuity, was irrational or arbitrary.\n\n26. It is difficult to accede to the argument on behalf of the employees that a\ndecision of the Central Government/State Governments to limit the benefits\nonly to employees, who retire or die on or after 1.4.1995, after calculating the\nfinancial implications thereon, was either irrational or arbitrary. Financial and\neconomic implications are very relevant and germane for any policy decision\ntouching the administration of the Government, at the Centre or at the State\nlevel.”\n\nOn the same proposition, reliance was also placed on\nA.K. Bindal v. Union of India\n,\n\n2003 (5) SCC 163, and our attention was drawn to the following observations\n\nrecorded therein:\n“13. The change in policy effected by these memorandums was that the\nGovernment would not provide any budgetary support for the wage increase\nand the undertakings themselves will have to generate the resources to meet\nthe additional expenditure, which will be incurred on account of increase in\nwages. So far as sick enterprises which were registered with BIFR are\nconcerned, it was directed that the revision in pay scale and other benefits\nwould be allowed only if it was actually decided to revive the industrial unit.\nThe question which arises for consideration is whether the employees of\npublic sector enterprises have any legal right to claim that though the\nindustrial undertakings or the companies in which they are working did not\nhave the financial capacity to grant revision in pay scale, yet the Government\nshould give financial support to meet the additional expenditure incurred in\nthat regard.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n17. The legal position is that identity of the government company remains\ndistinct from the Government. The government company is not identified with\nthe Union but has been placed under a special system of control and\nconferred certain privileges by virtue of the provisions contained in\nSections\nand\nof the Companies Act. Merely because the entire shareholding is\nowned by the Central Government will not make the incorporated company as\nCentral Government. It is also equally well settled that the employees of the\ngovernment company are not civil servants and so are not entitled to the\nprotection afforded by\nArticle 311\nof the Constitution (\nPyare Lal Sharma\nv. Managing Director\n, (1989) 3 SCC 448). Since employees of government\ncompanies are not government servants, they have absolutely no legal right\nto claim that government should pay their salary or that the addition\nexpenditure incurred on account of revision of their pay scale should be met\nby the government. Being employees of the companies it is the responsibility\nof the companies to pay them salary and if the company is sustaining losses\ncontinuously over a period and does not have the financial capacity to revise\nor enhance the pay scale, the petitioners cannot claim any legal right to ask\nfor a direction to the Central Government to meet the additional expenditure\nwhich may be incurred on account of revision of pay scales. It appears that\nprior to issuance of the office memorandum dated 12-4-1993 the Government\nhad been providing the necessary funds for the management of public sector\nenterprises which had been incurring losses. After the change in economic\npolicy introduced in early nineties, Government took a decision that the public\nsector undertakings will have to generate their own resources to meet the\nadditional expenditure incurred on account of increase in wages and that the\ngovernment will not provide any funds for the same. Such of the public sector\nenterprises (government companies) which had become sick and had been\nreferred to BIFR, were obviously running on huge losses and did not have\ntheir own resources to meet the financial liability which would have been\nincurred by revision of pay scales. By the office memorandum dated\n19-7-1995 the Government merely reiterated its earlier stand and issued a\ncaution that till a decision was taken to revive the undertakings, no revision in\npay scale should be allowed. We, therefore, do not find any infirmity, legal or\nconstitutional in the two office memorandums which have been challenged in\nthe writ petitions.\n\n18. We are unable to accept the contention of Shri Venkataramani that on\naccount of non-revision of pay scales of the petitioners in the year 1992, there\nhas been any violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.\nArticle 21\nprovides that no person shall be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure\nestablished by law. The scope and content of this article has been expanded\nby judicial decisions. Right to life enshrined in this article means something\nmore than survival or animal existence. It would include the right to live with\nhuman dignity. Payment of a very small subsistence allowance to an\nemployee under suspension which would be wholly insufficient to sustain his\nliving, was held to be violative of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution in\nState of\nMaharashtra v. Chandrabhan Tale\n, (1983) 3 SCC 387.\n\nSimilarly, unfair\nconditions of labour in People's Union for\nDemocratic Rights v. Union of India\n,\n(1982) 3 SCC 235.\n\nIt has been held to embrace within its field the right to\nlivelihood by means which are not illegal, immoral or opposed to public policy\nin\nOlga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corpn.\n, (1985) 3 SCC 545. But to hold that\nmere non-revision of pay scale would also amount to a violation of the\nfundamental right guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nwould be stretching it too far\nand cannot be countenanced. Even under the industrial law, the view is that\nthe workmen should get a minimum wage or a fair wage but not that their\nwages must be revised and enhanced periodically. It is true that on account of\ninflation there has been a general price rise but by that fact alone it is not\npossible to draw an inference that the salary currently being paid to them is\nwholly inadequate to lead a life with human dignity. What should be the salary\nstructure to lead a \"life with human dignity\" is a difficult exercise and cannot\nbe measured in absolute terms…..\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n22.\nIn\nSouth Malabar Gramin Bank v. Coordination Committee of S.M.G.B\nEmployees' Union and S.M.G.B Officers' Federation\n, (2001) 4 SCC 101, relied\nupon by the learned counsel for the petitioners, the Central Government had\nreferred the dispute regarding the pay structure of the employees of the Bank\nto the Chairman of the National Industrial Tribunal headed by a former Chief\nJustice of a High Court. The Tribunal after consideration of the material placed\nbefore it held that the officers and employees of the Regional Rural Banks will\nbe entitled to claim parity with the officers and other employees of the sponsor\nbanks in the matter of pay scale, allowances and other benefits. The\nemployees of nationalised commercial banks were getting their pay scales on\nthe basis of the 5th bipartite settlement and by implementation of the award of\nthe National Industrial Tribunal, the employees of the Regional Rural Banks\nwere also given the benefits of the same settlement. Subsequently, the pay\nstructures of the employees of the nationalised commercial banks were\nfurther revised by the 6th and 7th bipartite settlements but the same was not\ndone for the employees of the Regional Rural Banks who then filed writ\npetitions. It was contended on behalf of the Union of India and also the Banks\nthat financial condition of the Regional Rural Banks was not such that they\nmay give their employees the pay structure of the employees of the\nnationalised commercial banks. It was in these circumstances that this Court\nobserved that the decision of the National Industrial Tribunal in the form of an\naward having been implemented by the Central Government, it would not be\npermissible for the employer bank or the Union of India to take such a plea in\nthe proceedings before the Court.\n\nThe other case namely\nAll India Regional\nRural Bank Officers Federation v. Govt. of India\n, (2002) 3 SCC 554, arose out\nof interlocutory applications and contempt petitions which were filed for\nimplementation of the direction issued in the earlier case, namely, South\nMalabar Gramin Bank. Any observation in these two cases to the effect that\nthe financial capacity of the employer cannot be held to be a germane\nconsideration for determination of the wage structure of the employees must,\ntherefore, be confined to the facts of the aforesaid case and cannot be held to\nbe of general application in all situations.\n\nIn\nAssociate Banks Officers' Assn.\nv. State Bank of India\n, (1998) 1 SCC 428, it was observed that many\ningredients go into the shaping of the wage structure of any organisation\nwhich may have been shaped by negotiated settlements with employees'\nunions or through industrial adjudication or with the help of expert committees.\n\nThe economic capability of the employer also plays a crucial part in it; as also\nits capacity to expand business or earn more profits. It was also held that a\nsimplistic approach, granting higher remuneration to workers in one\norganisation because another organisation had granted them, may lead to\nundesirable results and the application of the doctrine would be fraught with\ndanger and may seriously affect the efficiency and at times, even the\nfunctioning of the organisation. Therefore, it appears to be the consistent view\nof this Court that the economic viability or the financial capacity of the\nemployer is an important factor which cannot be ignored while fixing the wage\nstructure, otherwise the unit itself may not be able to function and may have to\nclose down which will inevitably have disastrous consequences for the\nemployees themselves. The material on record clearly shows that both FCI\nand HFC had been suffering heavy losses for the last many years and the\nGovernment had been giving a considerable amount for meeting the\nexpenses of the organisations.\nIn such a situation, the employees cannot\nlegitimately claim that their pay scales should necessarily be revised and\nenhanced even though the organisations in which they are working are\nmaking continuous losses and are deeply in the red.”\n\nLast of all, learned counsel drew our attention to\nOfficers & Supervisors of I.D.P.L. v.\n\nChairman & M.D., I.D.P.L.\n, (2003) 6 SCC 490, and reference was made to the\n\nfollowing;\n\n“7. In the above background, the question which arises for consideration is\nwhether the employees of public sector enterprises have any legal right to\nclaim revision of wages that though the industrial undertakings or the\ncompanies in which they are working did not have the financial capacity to\ngrant revision in pay-scale, yet the Government should give financial support\nto meet the additional expenditure incurred in that regard.\n8. We have carefully gone through the pleadings, the Annexures filed by\nboth sides and the orders passed by the BIFR and the judgments cited by the\ncounsel appearing on either side. Learned counsel for the contesting\nrespondent drew our attention to a recent judgment of this Court in\nA.K.\nBindal and Anr. v. Union of India\n, (2003) 5 SCC 163, in support of her\ncontention. We have perused\nthe said judgment\n. In our opinion, since the\nemployees of Government companies are not Government servants, they\nhave absolutely no legal right to claim that the Government should pay their\nsalary or that the additional expenditure incurred on account of revision of\ntheir pay-scales should be met by the Government. Being employees of the\ncompanies, it is the responsibility of the companies to pay them salary and if\nthe company is sustaining losses continuously over a period and does not\nhave the financial capacity to revise or enhance the pay-scale, the petitioners,\nin our view, cannot claim any legal right to ask for a direction to the Central\nGovernment to meet the additional expenditure which may be incurred on\naccount of revision of pay-scales. We are unable to countenance the\nsubmission made by Mr. Sanghi that economic viability of the industrial unit or\nthe financial capacity of the employer cannot be taken into consideration in\nthe matter of revision of pay-scales of the employees.”\n\n15. Based on the conclusions drawn in the above judgments, it was the\n\ncontention of learned counsel, that the decision of the State Government to repeal\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, on the basis of the report of the high powered committee, dated\n\n28.10.2003, cannot be faulted. It was submitted, that the determination rendered by\n\nthe High Court, was in clear disregard to the decisions in the cited cases. It was\n\naccordingly urged, that the option exercised by the State Government, on the basis\n\nof legitimate material and consideration, could not be interfered with, as the same\n\nconstituted a legal and valid basis, for the discontinuation of ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\n16. In order to support the State Government’s claim, it was also the contention of\n\nlearned counsel, that the State Government has an inherent right to review its policy\n\ndecisions, and as long as the decisions of the State Government are based on\n\nbonafide consideration, the same cannot be assailed in law.\nIn order to support the\n\ninstant contention, learned counsel placed reliance on\nBALCO Employees’ Union v.\nUnion of India\n, (2002) 2 SCC 333, and invited our attention to the following\n\nobservations, expressed therein:\n\n“45.\nIn\nNarmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India\n, (2000) 10 SCC 664, there\nwas a challenge to the validity of the establishment of a large dam. It was held\nby the majority at p. 762 as follows: (SCC para 229)\n\"229. It is now well settled that the courts, in the exercise of their\njurisdiction, will not transgress into the field of policy decision. Whether to\nhave an infrastructural project or not and what is the type of project to be\nundertaken and how it has to be executed, are part of policy-making\nprocess and the courts are ill-equipped to adjudicate on a policy decision\nso undertaken. The court, no doubt, has a duty to see that in the\nundertaking of a decision, no law is violated and people's fundamental\nrights are not transgressed upon except to the extent permissible under\nthe Constitution.\"\n\n46. It is evident from the above that it is neither within the domain of the courts\nnor the scope of the judicial review to embark upon an enquiry as to whether\na particular public policy is wise or whether better public policy can be\nevolved. Nor are our courts inclined to strike down a policy at the behest of a\npetitioner merely because it has been urged that a different policy would have\nbeen fairer or wiser or more scientific or more logical.\n\n47. Process of disinvestment is a policy decision involving complex economic\nfactors. The courts have consistently refrained from interfering with economic\ndecisions as it has been recognised that economic expediencies lack\nadjudicative disposition and unless the economic decision, based on\neconomic expediencies, is demonstrated to be so violative of constitutional or\nlegal limits on power or so abhorrent to reason, that the Courts would decline\nto interfere. In matters relating to economic issues, the Government has, while\ntaking a decision, right to \"trial and error\" as long as both trial and error are\nbona fide and within limits of authority. There is no case made out by the\npetitioner that the decision to disinvest in BALCO is in any way capricious,\narbitrary, illegal or uninformed. Even though the workers may have interest in\nthe manner in which the Company is conducting its business, inasmuch as its\npolicy decision may have an impact on the workers’ rights, nevertheless it is\nan incidence of service for an employee to accept a decision of the employer\nwhich has been honestly taken and which is not contrary to law. Even a\ngovernment servant, having the protection of not only\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution but also of\nArticle 311\n, has no absolute right to remain in service.\n\nFor example, apart from cases of disciplinary action, the services of\ngovernment servants can be terminated if posts are abolished. If such\nemployee cannot make a grievance based on Part III of the Constitution or\n\nArticle 311\nthen it cannot stand to reason that like the petitioners,\nnon-government employees working in a company which by reason of judicial\npronouncement may be regarded as a State for the purpose of Part III of the\nConstitution, can claim a superior or a better right than a government servant\nand impugn it's change of status. In taking of a policy decision in economic\nmatters at length, the principles of natural justice have no role to play. While it\nis expected of a responsible employer to take all aspects into consideration\nincluding welfare of the labour before taking any policy decision that, by itself,\nwill not entitle the employees to demand a right of hearing or consultation\nprior to the taking of the decision.”\n\n17. Learned counsel submitted, that the respondent-employees could not claim a\n\nvested right, with reference to the provisions of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. In this behalf, it\n\nwas submitted, that neither the principle of estoppel, nor that of promissory estoppel,\n\ncould be invoked by the employees, so as to claim a right to be governed by ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’. For canvassing that the principle of estoppel could not be invoked\n\nby the employees, learned counsel placed reliance on\nM. Ramanatha Pillai v. State\n\nof Kerala\n, (1973) 2 SCC 650, and invited the Court’s attention to the following:\n\n“36. The abolition of post may have the consequence of termination of\nservice of a government servant. Such termination is not dismissal or removal\nwithin the meaning of\nArticle 311\nof the Constitution. The opportunity of\nshowing cause against the proposed penalty of dismissal or removal does not\ntherefore arise in the case of abolition of post. The abolition of post is not a\npersonal penalty against the government servant. The abolition of post is an\nexecutive policy decision. Whether after abolition of the post the Government\nservant who was holding the post would be offered any employment under the\nState would therefore be a matter of policy decision of the Government\nbecause the abolition of post does not confer on the person holding the\nabolished post any right to hold the post.”\n\nReliance was also placed on\nExcise Commissioner, U.P., Allahabad v. Ram Kumar\n,\n\n(1976) 3 SCC 540, and reference was made to the following observations recorded\n\ntherein:\n\n“Appeals Nos. 399 to 404 of 1975 which raise another point as well viz. the\nvalidity of the appellants’ demand from the respondents in respect of sales tax\nat the rate of ten paise per rupee on the retail sales of country spirit made by\nthe latter with effect from April 2, 1969 stand on a slightly different footing.\nSection 3-A and 4 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 clearly authorise the State\nGovernment to impose sales tax. The fact that sales of country liquor had\nbeen exempted from sales tax vide Notification No. ST-1149/X-802(33)-51\ndated April 6, 1959 could not operate as an estoppel against the State\nGovernment and preclude it from subjecting the sales to tax if it felt impelled\nto do so in the interest of the Revenues of the State which are required for\nexecution of the plans designed to meet the ever increasing pressing needs of\nthe developing society. It is now well settled by a catena of decisions that\nthere can be no question of estoppel against the Government in the exercise\nof its legislative, sovereign or executive powers.”\n\nTo demonstrate that the principle of promissory estoppel could not be invoked by the\n\nrespondent-employees, reference was also made to\nUnion of India v. Godfrey\n\nPhilips India Ltd.\n, (1985) 4 SCC 369, wherein it has been held as under:\n\n“13. Of course we must make it clear, and that is also\nlaid down in\nMotilal\nSugar Mills case, (1979) 2 SCC 409, that there can be no promissory\nestoppel against the Legislature in the exercise of its legislative functions nor\ncan the Government or public authority be debarred by promissory estoppel\nfrom enforcing a statutory prohibition. It is equally true that promissory\nestoppel cannot be used to compel the Government or a public authority to\ncarry out a representation or promise which is contrary to law or which was\noutside the authority or power of the officer of the Government or of the public\nauthority to make. We may also point out that the doctrine of promissory\nestoppel being an equitable doctrine, it must yield when the equity so\nrequires; if it can be shown by the Government or public authority that having\nregard to the facts as they have transpired, it would be inequitable to hold the\nGovernment or public authority to the promise or representation made by it,\nthe Court would not raise an equity in favour of the person to whom the\npromise or representation is made and enforce the promise or representation\nagainst the Government or public authority. The doctrine of promissory\nestoppel would be displaced in such a case, because on the facts, equity\nwould not require that the Government or public authority should be held\nbound by the promise or representation made by it. This aspect has been\ndealt with fully in Motilal Sugar Mills case and we find ourselves wholly in\nagreement with what has been said in that decision on this point.”\n\n18. In order to support the contention, that the respondent-employees had no\n\nvested right under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, reliance was placed on paragraph 4 of ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’ (already extracted above). It was the pointed assertion of learned\n\ncounsel, based on paragraph 4 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, that a claim towards pension\n\ncould be raised by an employee under ‘the 1999 Scheme’ only “…when an\n\nemployee retires or is retired or dies or is discharged as the case may be …”. It was\n\nsubmitted, that only such of the employees who could avail the benefit of pension,\n\nwere protected from the effect of the repeal notification dated 2.12.2004. It was\nsubmitted, that such of the employees who had opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’, but\n\nwere not occasioned with the effect of the contingencies contemplated under\n\nparagraph 4 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, were not entitled to claim a vested right. It was\n\nurged, that a vested right can only be established, when all the incidents which\n\nwould entitle an employee to draw pensionary rights, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’,\n\nstood satisfied. It was pointed out, that only on the happening of one of the events\n\ndepicted in paragraph 4, a vested right would emerge. It was the unequivocal\n\nsubmission of learned counsel for the appellants, that none of the\n\nrespondent-employees in the present controversy, can claim a vested right under\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, as neither of them had retired on attaining the age of\n\nsuperannuation (after putting in the postulated qualifying service), or had been\n\nretired by the employer, or had died in harness, or had been discharged from\n\nservice. It was therefore asserted, that the challenge raised at the hands of the\n\nrespondents, to the notification dated 2.12.2004, was legally unacceptable.\nIn this\n\nbehalf, learned counsel invited our attention to\nCommissioner of Income-tax, Kerala\n\nand Coimbatore v. L.W. Russel\n, (1964) 7 SCR 569, wherefrom our attention was\n\ndrawn to the following:\n\n“Before we attempt to construe the scope of\ns. 7(1)\nof the Act it will be\nconvenient at the outset to notice the provisions of the scheme, for the scope\nof the respondent's right in the amounts representing the employer's\ncontributions thereunder depends upon it. The trust deed and the rules dated\nJuly 27, 1934, embody the superannuation scheme. The scheme is described\nas the English and Scottish Joint Co-operative Wholesale Society Limited\nOverseas European Employees' Superannuation Scheme, hereinafter called\nthe Scheme. It is established for the benefit of the male European members of\nthe Society's staff employed in India, Ceylon and Africa by means of deferred\nannuities. The Society itself is appointed thereunder as the first trustee. The\ntrustees shall act as agents for and on behalf of the Society and the members\nrespectively; they shall effect or cause to be effected such policy or policies as\nmay be necessary to carry out the scheme and shall collect and arrange for\nthe payment of the moneys payable under such policy or policies and shall\nhold such moneys as trustees for and on behalf of the person or persons\nentitled thereto under the rules of the Scheme. The object of the Scheme is to\nprovide for pensions by means of deferred annuities for the members upon\nretirement from employment on attaining certain age under the conditions\nmentioned therein, namely, every European employee of the Society shall be\nrequired as a condition of employment to apply to become a member of the\nScheme from the date of his engagement by the Society and no member shall\nbe entitled to relinquish his membership except on the termination of his\nemployment with Society; the pension payable to a member shall be provided\nby means of a policy securing a deferred annuity upon the life of such\nmember to be effected by the Trustees as agents for and on behalf of the\nSociety and the members respectively with the Co-operative Insurance\nSociety Limited securing the payment to the Trustees of an annuity equivalent\nto the pension to which such member shall be entitled under the Scheme and\nthe Rules; the insurers shall agree that the Trustees shall be entitled to\nsurrender such deferred annuity and that, on such deferred annuity being so\nsurrendered, the insurers will pay to the Trustees the total amount of the\npremiums paid in respect thereof together with compound interest thereon; all\nmoneys received by the Trustees from the insurers shall be held by them as\nTrustees for and on behalf of the person or persons entitled thereto under the\nRules of the Scheme; any policy or policies issued by the insurers in\nconnection with the Scheme shall be deposited with the Trustees; the Society\nshall contribute one-third of the premium from time to time payable in respect\nof the policy securing the deferred annuity in respect of each member as\nthereinbefore provided and the member shall contribute the remaining\ntwo-thirds; the age at which a member shall normally retire from the service of\nthe Society shall be the age of 55 years and on retirement at such age a\nmember shall be entitled to receive a pension of the amount specified in Rule\n6; a member may also, after following the prescribed procedure, commute the\npension to which he is entitled for a payment in cash in accordance with the\nfourth column of the Table in the Appendix annexed to the Rules; if a member\nshall leave or be dismissed from the service of the Society for any reason\nwhatsoever or shall die while in the service of the Society there shall be paid\nto him or his legal personal representatives the total amount of the portions of\nthe premiums paid by such member and if he shall die whilst in the service of\nthe Society there shall be paid to him or his legal personal representatives the\ntotal amount of the portions of the premiums paid by such member and if he\nshall die whilst in the service of the Society or shall leave or be dismissed\nfrom the service of the Society on account of permanent breakdown in health\n(as to the bona fides of which the Trustees shall be satisfied) such further\nproportion (if any) of the total amount of the portions of the premiums paid by\nthe Society in respect of that member shall be payable in accordance with\nTable C in the Appendix to the Rules; if the total amount of the portions of the\npremiums in respect of such member paid by the Society together with\ninterest thereon as aforesaid shall not be paid by the Trustees to him or his\nlegal personal representatives under sub-s. (1) of r. 15 then such proportion or\nthe whole, as the case may be, of the Society's portion of such premiums and\ninterest thereon as aforesaid as shall not be paid by the Trustees to such\nmember or his legal personal representatives as aforesaid shall be paid by\nthe Trustees to the Society; the rules may be altered, amended or rescinded\nand new rules may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Trust\nDeed but not otherwise.\n\nWe have given the relevant part of the Scheme and the Rules. The gist of the\nScheme may be stated thus: The object of the Scheme is to provide for\npensions to its employees. It is achieved by creating a trust. The Trustees\nappointed thereunder are the agents of the employer as well as of the\nemployees and hold the moneys received from the employer, the employee\nand the insurer in trust for and on behalf of the person or persons entitled\nthereto under the rules of the Scheme. The Trustees are enjoined to take out\npolicies of insurance securing a deferred annuity upon the life of each\nmember, and funds are provided by contributions from the employer as well\nas from the employees. The Trustees realise the annuities and pay the\npensions to the employees. Under certain contingencies mentioned above, an\nemployee would be entitled to the pension only after superannuation. If the\nemployee leave the service of the Society or is dismissed from service or dies\nin the service of the Society, he will be entitled only to get back the total\namount of the portion of the premium paid by him, though the trustees in their\ndiscretion under certain circumstances may give him a proportion of the\npremiums paid by the Society. The entire amount representing the\ncontributions made by the Society or part thereof, as the case may be, will\nthen have to be paid by the Trustees to the Society. Under the scheme the\nemployee has not acquired any vested right in the contributions made by the\nSociety. Such a right vests in him only when he attains the age of\nsuperannuation. Till that date that amount vests in the Trustees to be\nadministered in accordance with the rules; that is to say, in case the employee\nceases to be a member of the Society by death or otherwise, the amount\ncontributed by the employer with interest thereon, subject to the discretionary\npower exercisable by the trustees, become payable to the Society. If he\nreaches the age of superannuation, the said contributions irrevocably become\nfixed as part of the funds yielding the pension. To put it in other words, till a\nmember attains the age of superannuation the employer's share of the\ncontributions towards the premiums does not vest in the employee. At best he\nhas a contingent right therein. In one contingency the said amount becomes\npayable to the employer and in another contingency, to the employee.”\n\nFor the same proposition, learned counsel, placed reliance on Krishena Kumar v.\n\nUnion of India, (1990) 4 SCC 207, and drew our attention to the following:\n\n“32. In Nakara, (1983) 1 SCC 305, it was never held that both the pension\nretirees and the P.F. retirees formed a homogeneous class and that any\nfurther classification among them would be violative of\nArticle 14.\nOn the other\nhand the court clearly observed that it was not dealing with the problem of a\n\"fund\". The Railway Contributory Provident Fund is by definition a fund.\nBesides, the government's obligation towards an employee under C.P.F.\nScheme to give the matching contribution begins as soon as his account is\nopened and ends with his retirement when his rights qua the Government in\nrespect of the Provident Fund is finally crystallized and thereafter no statutory\nobligation continues. Whether there still remained a moral obligation is a\ndifferent matter. On the other hand under the Pension Scheme the\nGovernment's obligation does not begin until the employee retires when only it\nbegins and it continues till the death of the employee. Thus, on the retirement\nof an employee government's legal obligation under the Provident Fund\naccount ends while under the Pension Scheme it begins. The rules governing\nthe Provident Fund and its contribution are entirely different from the rules\ngoverning pension. It would not, therefore, be reasonable to argue that what is\napplicable to the pension retirees must also equally be applicable to P.F.\nretirees. This being the legal position the rights of each individual P.F. retiree\nfinally crystallized on his retirement whereafter no continuing obligation\nremained, while on the other hand, as regards Pension retirees, the obligation\ncontinued till their death…..”\n\nBased on the legal position declared by this Court in the above judgments, it was\n\nurged, that in the absence of any vested right, a challenge to the notification dated\n\n2.12.2004, was neither sustainable nor maintainable in law.\n\n19. It would be relevant to notice, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ became operational with\n\neffect from 1.4.1999. It remained operational till the issuance of notification dated\n\n2.12.2004. While repealing ‘the 1999 Scheme’, the notification dated 2.12.2004, did\n\nnot deprive such of the employees who had retired during subsistence of the\n\nScheme, of the benefits that had accrued to them, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. Only\n\nsuch of the employees who were to retire on or after 2.12.2004, were disentitled to\n\nthe benefits under the Scheme. It was the submission of learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, that the choice of the cut-off date – 2.12.2004 in the present controversy,\n\nis a permissible incident in law. It was pointed out, that the instant proposition has\n\nbeen repeatedly examined by this Court, wherein cut-off dates have been upheld;\n\nsometimes even where the cut-off date had been made applicable retrospectively.\n\nFor the instant proposition, learned counsel placed reliance on\nUnion of India v. P.N.\nMenon\n, (1994) 4 SCC 68, and invited the Court’s attention to the following\n\nobservations:\n\n“8. Whenever the Government or an authority, which can be held to be a\nState within the meaning of\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution, frames a scheme for\npersons who have superannuated from service, due to many constraints, it is\nnot always possible to extend the same benefits to one and all, irrespective of\nthe dates of superannuation. As such any revised scheme in respect of\npost-retirement benefits, if implemented with a cut-off date, which can be held\nto be reasonable and rational in the light of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution, need\nnot be held to be invalid. It shall not amount to “picking out a date from the\nhat”, as was said by this Court in the case of\nD.R. Nim v. Union of India\n, AIR\n1967 SC 1301, in connection with fixation of seniority.\n\nWhenever a revision\ntakes place, a cut-off date becomes imperative, because the benefit has to be\nallowed within the financial resources available with the Government.”\n\nReliance was also placed on\nState of West Bengal v. Ratan Behari Dey\n, (1993) 4\n\nSCC 62, and our attention was drawn to the following conclusions:\n\n“7. In our opinion, the principle of Nakara, (1983) 1 SCC 305, has no\napplication to the facts of this case. The precise principle enunciated in\nNakara (supra) has been duly explained in Krishena Kumar, (1990) 4 SCC\n207, by a coordinate Bench. For reasons to be assigned hereinafter, it cannot\nbe said that prescribing April 1, 1977 as the date from which the new\nRegulations were to come into force is either arbitrary or discriminatory. Now,\nit is open to the State or to the Corporation, as the case may be, to change\nthe conditions of service unilaterally. Terminal benefits as well as pensionary\nbenefits constitute conditions of service. The employer has the undoubted\npower to revise the salaries and/or the pay-scales as also terminal\nbenefits/pensionary benefits. The power to specify a date from which the\nrevision of pay scales or terminal benefits/pensionary benefits, as the case\nmay be, shall take effect is a concomitant of the said power. So long as such\ndate is specified in a reasonable manner, i.e., without bringing about a\ndiscrimination between similarly situated persons, no interference is called for\nby the court in that behalf. It appears that in the Calcutta Corporation, a\npension scheme was in force prior to 1914. Later, that scheme appears to\nhave been given up and the Provident Fund Scheme introduced under the\nProvident Fund Scheme, a certain amount was deducted from the salary of\nthe employees every month and credited to the Fund. An equal amount was\ncontributed by the employer which too was credited to the Fund. The total\namount to the credit of the employee in the Fund was paid to him on the date\nof his retirement. The employees, however, were demanding the introduction\nof a pension scheme. The demand fell on receptive years in the year 1977…\nmaybe because in that-year the Left Front Government came to power in that\nState, as suggested by the writ petitioners. The State Government appointed\na Commission to examine the said demand and to recommend the necessary\nmeasures in that behalf. The three members constituting the Commission\ndiffered with each other in certain particulars. The Government examined their\nrecommendations and accepted them with certain modifications in the year\n1981. After processing the matter through relevant departments, the\nRegulations were issued and published in the year 1982. In the above\ncircumstances, the State Government thought that it would be appropriate to\ngive effect to the said Regulations on and from April 1, 1977 i.e., the first day\nof the financial year in which the Pay Commission was appointed by the\nGovernment — a fact which could not have been unknown to the Corporation\nemployees. We cannot say that the Government acted unreasonably in\nspecifying the said date. It may also be said that, that was the year in which\nthe Left Front came into power in that State, but does not detract from the\nvalidity of the aforesaid reasons assigned by the State in its counter-affidavit\nfiled before the Division Bench of the High Court. We are not in agreement\nwith the opinion expressed by the High Court that the reasons assigned by\nthe State Government are neither relevant nor acceptable.\n\n8. In this context, it may be remembered that the power of the State to specify\na date with effect from which, the Regulations framed, or amended, as the\ncase may be, shall come into force is unquestioned. A date can be specified\nboth prospectively as well as retrospectively. The only question is whether the\nprescription of the date is unreasonable or discriminatory. Since we have\nfound that the prescription of the date in this case is neither arbitrary nor\nunreasonable, the complaint of discrimination must fail.\n\n9. Now coming to the argument of Sri P.P. Rao that the Regulations bring\nabout an unreasonable classification between similarly placed employees, we\nmust say that we are not impressed by it. It is not submitted that the\nCorporation had no power to give retrospective effect to the Regulations. It\nwas within the power of the Corporation to enforce the Regulations either\nprospectively or with retrospective effect from such date as they might specify.\n\nOf course, as repeatedly held by this Court, in such cases the State cannot,\nas the expression goes, pick a date out of its hat. It has to prescribe the date\nin a reasonable manner, having regard to all the relevant facts and\ncircumstances. Once this is done, question of discrimination does not arise.\nReference in this behalf may also be had to the decision of this Court in\n\nSushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan\n, 1985 Supp.\n\nSCC 45, a decision of the\nDivision Bench comprising E.S. Venkataramiah and Sabyasachi Mukharji, JJ.”\n\nIt was pointed out, that the determination rendered in the above two judgments has\n\nbeen reiterated by this Court in\nState of Rajasthan v. Amrit Lal Gandhi\n, (1997) 2\n\nSCC 342.\n\nLast of all, learned counsel invited the Court’s attention to\nR.R. Verma v.\n\nUnion of India\n, (1980) 3 SCC 402, wherefrom reliance was placed on the following:-\n\n“5. The last point raised by Shri Garg was that the Central Government had no\npower to review its earlier orders as the rules do not vest the government with\nany such power. Shri Garg relied on certain decisions of this Court in support\nof his submission:\nPatel Narshi Thakershi v. Pradyumansinghji Arjunsinghji\n,\n(1971) 3 SCC 844;\nD.N. Roy v. State of Bihar\n, (\n1970) 3 SCC 119, and State of\nAssam v. J.N. Roy Biswas\n, (1976) 1 SCC 234. All the cases cited by Shri\nGarg are cases where the government was exercising quasi-judicial power\nvested in them by statute. We do not think that the principle that the power to\nreview must be conferred by statute either specifically or by necessary\nimplication is applicable to decisions purely of an administrative nature. To\nextend the principle to pure administrative decisions would indeed lead to\nuntoward and startling results. Surely, any government must be free to alter its\npolicy or its decision in administrative matters. If they are to carry on their\ndaily administration they cannot be hidebound by the rules and restrictions of\njudicial procedure though of course they are bound to obey all statutory\nrequirements and also observe the principles of natural justice where rights of\nparties may be affected. Here again, we emphasise that if administrative\ndecisions are reviewed, the decisions taken after review are subject to judicial\nreview on all grounds on which an administrative decision may be questioned\nin a court. We see no force in this submission of the learned counsel. The\nappeal is, therefore, dismissed.”\n\n20. Mr. R. Venkataramni, learned senior counsel, supplemented the submissions\n\nadvanced by Mr. P.P. Rao. In his opening statement, he endorsed the submissions\n\nadvanced by Mr. P.P. Rao, and accordingly, adopted the same.\n\n21. In addition, it was contended, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was introduced for the\n\nfirst time on 29.10.1999, with retrospective effect - from 1.4.1999. It was asserted,\n\nthat through ‘the 1999 Scheme’, it was proposed to supplement the post-retiral\n\nfinancial benefits of employees, engaged in corporate bodies, in the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh. It was urged, that employees of corporate bodies, were hitherto\n\nbefore, recipients of Contributory Provident Fund (CPF), as the sole post-retiral\n\nfinancial benefit. It was submitted, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’, required employees of\n\ncorporations to switch over from the CPF scheme, by exercising their option. And,\n\nsuch of the employees who did not exercise any option (under the provisions of ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’), were also deemed to have exercised their option for the said\n\nscheme, on the expiry of the period specified. It was highlighted, that the grant of\n\npension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, was based on the operation of the scheme.\nStated differently, the contention was, that the right to receive pension emerged from\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, and not from the option exercised by an employee, under the\n\nsaid scheme.\n\n22. Insofar as the operation of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ is concerned, it was submitted,\n\nthat the employer’s contribution to the CPF account of the employee (including\n\ninterest which had accrued thereon) upto 31.3.1999, was transferred to the State\n\nGovernment, so as to constitute the corpus fund, to be administered and maintained\n\nby the Finance Department of the State Government, which would make ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, self-financing. The above submission, was drawn from a collective\n\nreading of paragraphs 4(b) and 5 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was further contended,\n\nthat an employee’s own contribution to the CPF, i.e. the subscription amount\n\ncontributed by the employee to his own CPF account, was to be retained in his GPF\n\naccount. The instant employee’s contribution, was to be disbursed to him, at the\n\ntime of his retirement, as GPF. As such, it was pointed out, that the contributions\n\nmade by the employees, from out of their own funds, were unaffected by ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’.\n\n23. It was therefore highlighted by learned counsel, that the present controversy\n\nhas nothing to do with an employee’s contribution, but was limited to the right of an\n\nemployee to claim pension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was urged, that the\n\nexercise of an option to switch over from the CPF scheme, to ‘the 1999 Scheme’,\n\ndid not result in a vested right, to earn pension. To support the instant contention, it\n\nwas pointed out, that one of the pre-conditions for earning pension, is to have\n\nrendered the minimum stipulated qualifying service. It was submitted, that there\n\nwere various other similar conditions, on satisfaction whereof alone, an employee\n(despite his having exercised an option, to switch over to ‘the 1999 Scheme’), would\n\nbe entitled to pensionary benefits, after his retirement. It was, therefore asserted,\n\nthat the crystalisation of the right for a legitimate claim for pension, would accrue on\n\nsatisfaction of all the postulated conditions, and till the fulfillment of all the\n\nconditions, the mere exercise of option, to switch over to ‘the 1999 Scheme’, would\n\nnot result in vesting a right in the respondent-employees, to receive pension.\n\n24. In order to effectively project the assertion canvassed by him, the learned\n\ncounsel highlighted, that the exercise of option by the employees who were\n\nengaged in corporations in the State of Himachal Pradesh, did not result in the\n\nemployees having in any manner, altered their position to their disadvantage. It was\n\naverred, that the employees did not forego any pre-existing better or higher benefit,\n\nwhile exercising their option to switch over to ‘the 1999 Scheme’. Based\n\ncumulatively on the factual position projected above, it was urged, that it was not\n\nopen to the employees of corporations in the State of Himachal Pradesh, to call into\n\nquestion, the repeal of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, through the impugned notification dated\n\n2.12.2004.\n\n25.\nIn order to canvass the above proposition, that rights which were contingent\n\nupon the occurrence of an event, could not be described as vested rights, reliance\n\nwas placed on\nHowrah Municipal Corporation v. Ganges Rope Co. Ltd.\n, (2004) 1\n\nSCC 663, and the following observations recorded therein:-\n\n“37. The argument advanced on the basis of so-called creation of vested\nright for obtaining sanction on the basis of the Building Rules (unamended) as\nthey were on the date of submission of the application and the order of the\nHigh Court fixing a period for decision of the same, is misconceived. The word\n“vest” is normally used where an immediate fixed right in present or future\nenjoyment in respect of a property is created. With the long usage the said\nword “vest” has also acquired a meaning as “an absolute or indefeasible right”\n[see K.J. Aiyer's Judicial Dictionary (A Complete Law Lexicon), 13th Edn.].\nThe context in which the respondent Company claims a vested right for\nsanction and which has been accepted by the Division Bench of the High\nCourt, is not a right in relation to “ownership or possession of any property” for\nwhich the expression “vest” is generally used. What we can understand from\nthe claim of a “vested right” set up by the respondent Company is that on the\nbasis of the Building Rules, as applicable to their case on the date of making\nan application for sanction and the fixed period allotted by the Court for its\nconsideration, it had a “legitimate” or “settled expectation” to obtain the\nsanction. In our considered opinion, such “settled expectation”, if any, did not\ncreate any vested right to obtain sanction. True it is, that the respondent\nCompany which can have no control over the manner of processing of\napplication for sanction by the Corporation cannot be blamed for delay but\nduring pendency of its application for sanction, if the State Government, in\nexercise of its rule-making power, amended the Building Rules and imposed\nrestrictions on the heights of buildings on G.T. Road and other wards, such\n“settled expectation” has been rendered impossible of fulfillment due to\nchange in law. The claim based on the alleged “vested right” or “settled\nexpectation” cannot be set up against statutory provisions which were brought\ninto force by the State Government by amending the Building Rules and not\nby the Corporation against whom such “vested right” or “settled expectation”\nis being sought to be enforced. The “vested right” or “settled expectation” has\nbeen nullified not only by the Corporation but also by the State by amending\nthe Building Rules. Besides this, such a “settled expectation” or the so-called\n“vested right” cannot be countenanced against public interest and\nconvenience which are sought to be served by amendment of the Building\nRules and the resolution of the Corporation issued thereupon.”\n\nBased on the conclusions drawn in the cited judgment, it was submitted, that a\n\n‘legitimate’ or a ‘settled expectation’, suggesting the possibility of drawing pension\n\nafter retirement, could not be treated as a vested right. It was submitted, that the\n\nrespondent-employees were not justified in raising a claim based on the\n\nassumption, that they had a vested right, or ‘settled expectation’, under ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, particularly in the light of the fact, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ had been partly\n\nnullified, by the notification dated 2.12.2004.\n\n26. It was also the assertion of learned counsel, that the repeal notification dated\n\n2.12.2004, had the consequence of termination/cessation of benefits, as would\n\nemerge from the analogy of the principles expressed in\nSection 6\nof the General\n\nClauses Act. It was further submitted, that the requirement of dealing with rights and\nliabilities insofar as the present controversy is concerned, is clearly based on a valid\n\nclassification. It was urged, that truly and factually, there was no classification\n\nwhatsoever, inasmuch as, the benefits under ‘the 1999 Scheme’ were extended to a\n\nminiscule section of the employees, and excluded uniformally an overwhelming\n\nmajority of employees. Learned counsel questioned the veracity of the conclusion\n\ndrawn by the High Court, by reading down the repeal notification dated 2.12.2004,\n\nfor the reason, that the same would deprive pensionary rights to those employees,\n\nwho had opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’, and had retired after 2.12.2004, as also, the\n\nemployees who were already in service when ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was notified on\n\n29.10.1999, and had become members of that scheme, and were due to retire after\n\n2.12.2004. It was pointed out, that the above determination at the hands of the High\n\nCourt, would have the effect of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ remaining in place, till such time\n\nas employees engaged in corporations upto 2.12.2004 eventually retired on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation. In the above view of the matter, it was\n\nasserted, that in the manner the legality of the issue has been determined by the\n\nHigh Court, ‘the 1999 Scheme’ which was repealed on 2.12.2004, would actually\n\nand factually continue to be operational, for a further period of approximately 20\n\nyears, by which time alone, employees engaged prior to the notification dated\n\n2.12.2004, would retire from service.\n\n27. It was also the contention of learned counsel, that the confinement of the\n\npensionary benefits under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, to such of the employees, who had\n\nretired from the concerned corporations, between 1.4.1999 and 2.12.2004, could not\n\nbe invalidated because the right to receive pension stood crystalised and vested in\n\nthem in terms of paragraph 4 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was submitted, that a\nstatutory classification cannot be set aside, when there is overwhelming justification,\n\ndemonstrating a valid basis, therefor. The repeal of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was based\n\non financial constraints, which had not been legitimately repudiated.\nInsofar as the\n\ninstant aspect of the matter is concerned, learned counsel, in the first instance,\n\nplaced reliance on\nState of Rajasthan v. Amrit Lal Gandhi\n(supra), and our attention\n\nwas invited to the following observations recorded therein:-\n\n“16. Applying the ratio of the aforesaid decisions to the present case, we find\nno justification for the High Court having substituted the date of 1-1-1986 in\nlieu of 1-1-1990. It is evident that for introducing a pension scheme, which\nenvisaged financial implications, approval of the Rajasthan Government was\nrequired. In the letter of 16-4-1991, written to the Vice-Chancellors of different\nuniversities of Rajasthan, it was stated as follows:\n\n“As per the direction in regard to the aforesaid subject, the State\nGovernment has decided to introduce Pension Scheme in the\nUniversities of the State w.e.f. 1-1-1990. In this regard the State\nLegislature has passed University Pension Rules and General\nProvident Fund Rules. Therefore, by enclosing a copy of University\nPension Regulations and General Provident Fund Regulations with this\nletter, it is requested that by obtaining approval of the competent body\nor Syndicate of the University, these Regulations be implemented in the\nUniversity together and necessary information regarding\nimplementation be intimated.”\n\n17. The Syndicate and Senate of the University, when they had forwarded\ntheir recommendations in 1986, did not contain a specific date with effect from\nwhich the pension scheme was to be made applicable. Their\nrecommendations were subject to approval. The approval was granted by the\nGovernment, after the State Legislature had passed the University Pension\nRules and General Provident Fund Rules. The Government had stated in its\naffidavit before the High Court that the justification of the cut-off date of\n1-1-1990 was “wholly economic”. It cannot be said that the paying capacity is\nnot a relevant or valid consideration while fixing the cut-off date. The\nUniversity could, in 1991, validly frame Pension Regulations to be made\napplicable prospectively. It, however, chose to give them limited retrospectivity\nso as to cover a larger number of employees by taking into account the\nfinancial impact of giving retrospective operation to the Pension Regulations.\n\nIt was decided that employees retiring on or after 1-1-1990 would be able to\nexercise the option of getting either pension or provident fund. Financial\nimpact of making the Regulations retrospective can be the sole consideration\nwhile fixing a cut-off date. In our opinion, it cannot be said that this cut-off date\nwas fixed arbitrarily or without any reason. The High Court was clearly in error\nin allowing the writ petitions and substituting the date of 1-1-1986 for\n1-1-1990.”\nFor the same proposition, reliance was also placed in\nUnion of India v. R.\n\nSarangapani\n, (2000) 4 SCC 335, and our attention was drawn to the following\n\nobservations recorded therein:-\n\n“11. One more aspect which we want to emphasise is that the applicants\nwho were appointed to the technical posts and the other persons who were\nappointed to the non-technical posts are not on the same footing. The nature\nof their jobs was different, the qualifications for appointment were different and\nthe training period was to be longer for the technical staff. It was obviously\nnecessary that those who were to occupy the technical posts should have a\nlonger period of training than those who were to occupy the non-technical\nposts. The training period for the former was one year while the training period\nfor the latter was only three months. Naturally, the non-technical personnel\ncould therefore be appointed earlier to the technical personnel even if both\ngroups were selected at the same selection. Therefore, in view of the nature\nof the qualifications and nature of the posts and functions and duties, no\nequality in the dates of accrual of the increments could ever have been\nclaimed by the technical personnel comparing themselves to the\nnon-technical persons, by invoking\nArticle 14.\n\n12. If, however, the Government thought it fit to bring some sort of\nequalisation in the matter of commencement of their increments, it was\nobviously by way of a sheer concession and was not as a matter of right nor\nwas it to avoid any violation of any principles of equality under\nArticle 14.\nIn\nfact, the very official memorandum of the Government dated 22-10-1990\nstated that under the Fundamental Rule 26 read with Rule 9(6)(a)(i) it was\nonly in cases of probationers and apprentices where such appointments were\nfollowed by a confirmation that the said period of probation or apprenticeship\nwould be counted for the purpose of scale of pay attached to the posts. This\nprinciple would “not” as per the Rules be applicable to the training period.\n\nHowever, during the meetings of the National Council (JCM) it was\nrepresented that where the training period was long, as in the case of\ntechnical personnel, the disparity would become perpetual. Therefore, it is\nobvious that the concession was not based on\nArticle 14\nnor was it on the\nbasis of any rule but was clearly based only upon the fact that the training\nperiod of technical personnel was longer and the disparity would continue\nperpetually if these groups were selected at the same time. Therefore,\nGovernment considered initially to bring their increment on par with effect from\n1-1-1990 and later on it felt that the grievance could be rectified with effect\nfrom 1-1-1986 as mentioned above, the date of commencement of the\nrecommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission. It is, therefore, clear that\nthe Government decided to extend the benefit in the abovesaid manner, even\nthough parties had no right to the same either under\nArticle 14\nor under the\nRules and the date was mainly based on the financial burden. It was open to\nthe Government to decide, having regard to the budgetary provision, as to\nwhat extent it could go and whether it could fix a cut-off date which was\nco-terminus with the commencement of the recommendation of the Fourth\nPay Commission, namely, 1-1-1986. On the peculiar facts of this case the said\ndate was perfectly valid because the only consideration was the financial\nburden of the State and not any principle of equality.”\n\n28. In order to canvass the proposition noticed hereinabove, learned counsel also\n\nplaced reliance on, ‘A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations’, authored by\n\nThomas M. Cooley (Indian Reprint of 2005, Hindustan Law Book Company,\n\nCalcutta), and invited our attention to following observations recorded in Chapter XI,\n\nbearing the heading – Of The Protection To Property By ‘The Law Of The Land’:-\n\n“The chief restriction is that vested rights must not be disturbed; but in its\napplication as a shield of protection, the term “vested rights” is not used in any\nnarrow or technical sense, as importing a power of legal control merely, but\nrather as implying a vested interest which it is equitable the government\nshould recognize, and of which the individual cannot be deprived without\ninjustice.\n\nAnd before proceeding further, it may be well to consider, in the light of\nthe reported cases, what is a vested right in the constitutional sense, that we\nmay the better judge how far the general laws of the State may be changed,\nand how far special provisions may be made without coming under\ncondemnation. Every man holds all he possesses, and looks forward to all he\nhopes for, through the aid and protection of the laws; but as changes of\ncircumstances and of public opinion, as well as other reasons of public policy,\nare all the time calling for changes in the laws, and these changes must more\nor less affect the value and stability of private possessions, and strengthen or\ndestroy well-founded hopes; and as the power to make very many of them\nmust be conceded, it is apparent that many rights, privileges, and exemptions\nwhich usually pertain to ownership under a particular state of the law, and\nmany reasonable expectations, cannot be regarded as vested rights in any\nlegal sense. In many cases the courts, in the exercise of their ordinary\njurisdiction, cause the property vested in one person to be transferred to\nanother, either through a statutory power, or by the force of their judgments or\ndecrees, or by compulsory conveyances. If in these cases the court has\njurisdiction, they proceed in accordance with the law of the land, and the right\nof one man is divested by way of enforcing a higher and better right in\nanother. Of these cases we do not propose to speak; as constitutional\nquestions cannot well arise in regard to them, unless they be attended by\ncircumstances of irregularity which are supposed to take them out of the\noperation of the general rule. All vested rights are held subject to the laws for\nthe enforcement of public duties and private contracts, and for the punishment\nof wrongs; and if they become divested through the operation of these laws, it\nis only by way of enforcing the obligations of justice and good order. What we\ndesire to arrive at now, is the meaning of the term “vested rights”, when\nemployed by way of indicating the interests of which one cannot be deprived\nby the mere force of legislative enactment, or by any other than the\nrecognized modes of transferring title against the consent of the owner, to\nwhich we have alluded.”\n\nBased on the submissions recorded hereinabove, it was sought to be concluded,\n\nthat the respondent-employees had no vested right to claim pension under ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, and that, it was not open to them to assail the partial repeal of ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, vide notification dated 2.12.2004.\n\n29. In the process of repudiating the submissions advanced at the hands of the\n\nappellants, Mr. Guru Krishna Kumar, learned senior counsel representing the\n\nrespondent-employees, drew our attention to certain factual aspects of the matter,\n\nwhich according to him, needed to be kept in mind, while determining the veracity of\n\nthe challenge raised by the State Government. It was pointed out, that all the\n\nrespondent-employees, were already in the employment of corporate bodies, in the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh, on the date ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was introduced – on\n\n1.4.1999. Learned counsel asserted, that it was not disputed at the behest of the\n\nState Government, that all the respondent-employees were entitled to benefits\n\nunder ‘the 1999 Scheme’, either on account of having exercised their option to be\n\ngoverned by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, or by virtue of the deeming provision expressed in\n\nparagraph 2(2) of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was asserted, that all the employees who\n\ncame to be governed by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, constituted a homogenous class.\n\nInasmuch as, the employees whose right to claim pension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’\n\nhas not been disturbed, despite the repeal notification dated 2.12.2004, and those\n\nwhose right to draw pension has been taken away, cannot be distinguished in any\n\nmanner, except on the basis of the cut-off date, expressed in the repeal notification,\n\ndated 2.12.2004. It was contended, that merely because some of the employees\nhad retired prior to 2.12.2004, and the respondent-employees had retired after\n\n2.12.2004, cannot be accepted as a legitimate basis, to treat them differentially. It\n\nwas asserted, that the mandate of paragraph 1(2) of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ extended\n\npensionary benefits to employees engaged in corporate bodies, in the State of\n\nHimachal Pradesh, in accordance with the provisions laid down under the Central\n\nCivil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, and the Central Civil Services (Commutation\n\nof Pension) Rules, 1981 “… as amended and adopted by the Himachal Pradesh\n\nGovernment for the State Government employees, save as otherwise provided in\n\nthis scheme”. In the above view of the matter, it was asserted on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees, that the division of a homogenous class, so as to deprive\n\none set of employees benefits, which still remained extended to another set of\n\nemployees, was clearly unsustainable in law. It was pointed out with some\n\nemphasis, that the High Court had taken conscious notice of the fact, that ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’ was introduced by the State Government, after due deliberation by all\n\nconcerned stake holders, and upon approval by the Chief Minister and his Cabinet.\n\nIn the factual background highlighted hereinabove, it was urged, that denial of\n\npensionary benefits to one set of employees, out of a homogenous class, was\n\narbitrary and discriminatory, and as such, violative of the principles enshrined in\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. Based on the above factual\n\nbackground, it was urged, that the High Court was fully justified in reading down the\n\nrepeal notification dated 2.12.2004, so as to extend the benefit of ‘the 1999 Scheme’\n\nto all employees who either opted for, or were otherwise entitled to pensionary\n\nrights, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\n30. Learned counsel for the respondent-employees, contested the submission\nadvanced by learned counsel for the appellants, that subscription to ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’ by employees engaged in corporations in the State of Himachal Pradesh,\n\ndid not create a vested right in them. It was submitted, that a mere subscription to\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, by exercising their option to be governed by the same, created a\n\nvested right in the respondent-employees. In this behalf it was pointed out, that\n\nretirement on attaining the age of the superannuation, was relevant, only for the\n\npurpose of the accrual of a cause of action, for raising a claim for pension (under\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’). Learned counsel, while acknowledging, that a right to claim\n\npension would arise only when the concerned employee attained the age of\n\nsuperannuation, yet submitted, that the moment a contribution earlier payable to the\n\nemployees as CPF on their retirement, was diverted to the corpus fund maintained\n\nby the Finance Department of the State Government, the same created a contingent\n\nright in each one of them (under ‘the 1999 Scheme’) to claim pension. It was\n\ntherefore submitted, that there was no justification in the contention advanced on\n\nbehalf of the appellants, that the action of the respondent-employees in opting for\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, did not alter their position adversely, with reference to their\n\nerstwhile vested right (under the Employees Provident Funds Scheme, 1995).\nIn\n\norder to support his submission, that a vested right accrued to the\n\nrespondent-employees, when they subscribed to ‘the 1999 Scheme’, learned\n\ncounsel placed reliance on\nU.P. Raghavendra Acharya v. State of Karnataka\n, (2006)\n\n9 SCC 630, and drew our attention to the following observations recorded therein:-\n\n“3. It is not in dispute that the revised scales of pay as recommended by\nthe Pay Revision Committee became applicable to the appellants with effect\nfrom 1-1-1986. It is also not in dispute that the UGC scales of pay were\napplicable to them. The Government of Karnataka, by a letter dated\n17-12-1993, directed that the matter relating to the fixation of pension on the\nbasis of UGC pay scales would be governed by Rule 296 of the Karnataka\nCivil Services Rules (hereinafter referred to as “the Rules”), providing for\ncomputation of emoluments for the purpose of pension and gratuity of a\ngovernment servant. In the said letter it was stated:\n\n“The term ‘emoluments’ has been defined and redefined from time to time\nwhenever pension has been revised by executive orders. The term\nemoluments for purpose of pensionary benefits as defined in GO dated\n17-8-1987 includes among other things the last pay drawn. It is, therefore,\nclarified that the pay drawn by the teachers of degree colleges in respect\nof whom UGC scales have been extended by GO No. ED 88 UNI 88 dated\n30-3-1990 w.e.f. 1-1-1986 and who have opted to UGC scales of pay, the\nlast pay drawn by them in UGC scales of pay among other things may be\ntreated as emoluments for purpose of pensionary benefits under GO No.\nFD 20 SRS 87 (I) dated 17-8-1987.”\n*** *** ***\n\n9. However, para 27-A was inserted thereto in respect of revision of\npensionary benefits, which is to the following effect:\n\n“27-A. Revision of pensionary benefits.—(i) UGC scales as revised from\n1-1-1996 have been linked to the index level of 1510 points inasmuch\nas the revised pay scale structure includes the DA admissible as on\n1-1-1996 to the extent of 138% of basic pay. As on 1-1-1996 the\npensionary benefits under the State Government had not been revised.\nThe revised pay scales of the State Government employees came into\nforce from 1-4-1998 by merging the DA as on 1-1-1996. The pensionary\nbenefits were also simultaneously revised w.e.f. 1-4-1998. Therefore,\nthe revised pay drawn in the UGC pay scales for the period from\n1-1-1996 up to 31-3-1998 shall not be taken as emoluments for the\npurpose of pensionary benefits. Accordingly,—\n\n(a) In respect of teachers drawing UGC pay scales who have\nretired during the period from 1-1-1996 to 31-3-1998, they shall\nbe eligible for the benefit of the fixation of pay and arrears under\nthe revised UGC scales of pay only. There shall not be any\nchange in their pensionary benefits with reference to the revised\nUGC pay and the retirement benefits already sanctioned in the\npre-revised UGC pay scales will not undergo any modifications.\n\nHowever, they shall be entitled to the benefit of fixation of revised\npension/family pension as contemplated in GO No. FD (Spl.) 2\nPET 99 dated 15-2-1999 only w.e.f. 1-4-1998. Para 6 of GO No.\nFD (Spl.) 2 PET 99 dated 15-2-1999 stands modified to this\nextent.\n\n(b) In respect of teachers drawing UGC pay scales and who\nhave issued on or after 1-4-1998, the pay drawn in the revised\nUGC pay scales shall be counted for the purpose of pensionary\nbenefits and the orders revising the pensionary benefits vide GO\nNo. FD (Spl.) 2 PET 99 dated 15-2-1999 shall be made\napplicable.”\n*** *** ***\n\n23. The stand of the State of Karnataka that the pensionary benefits had\nbeen conferred on the appellants w.e.f. 1-4-1998 on the premise that the\nbenefit of the revision of scales of pay to its own employees had been\nconferred from 1-1-1998, in our opinion, is wholly misconceived. Firstly,\nbecause the employees of the State of Karnataka and the appellants, in the\nmatter of grant of benefit of revised scales of pay, do not stand on the same\nfooting as revised scales of pay had been made applicable to their cases from\na different date. Secondly, the appellants had been given the benefit of the\nrevised scales of pay w.e.f. 1-1-1996. It is now well settled that a notification\ncan be issued by the State accepting the recommendations of the Pay\nRevision Committee with retrospective effect as it was beneficent to the\nemployees. Once such a retrospective effect is given to the recommendations\nof the Pay Revision Committee, the employees concerned despite their\nreaching the age of superannuation in between the said dates and/or the date\nof issuance of the notification would be deemed to be getting the said scales\nof pay as on 1-1-1996. By reason of such notification, as the appellants had\nbeen deprived of a vested right, they could not have been deprived therefrom\nand that too by reason of executive instructions.\n\n*** *** ***\n\n25. Pension, as is well known, is not a bounty. It is treated to be a deferred\nsalary. It is akin to right of property. It is correlated and has a nexus with the\nsalary payable to the employees as on the date of retirement.\n\n*** *** ***\n\n28. The impugned orders furthermore are opposed to the basic principles of\nlaw inasmuch as by reason of executive instructions an employee cannot be\ndeprived of a vested or accrued right. Such a right to draw pension to the\nextent of 50% of the emoluments, computed in terms of the rules w.e.f.\n1-1-1996, vested in the appellants in terms of government notification read\nwith Rule 296 of the Rules.”\n\nBased on the above judgment, it was pointed out, that the right to draw revised\n\npension under the Karnataka Civil Service Rules, was held to be vested in the\n\nconcerned employees, from the date of revision of the pay-scales. It was pointed\n\nout, that while calculating pensionary benefits, it was imperative for the employer to\n\ntake into consideration, the actual pay drawn by the employees, at the time of their\n\nretirement. Accordingly it was held, that the action of the State Government in\n\ngranting revised pay-scales with retrospective effect (with effect from 1.1.1996), but\n\nextending the benefit of revised pay for calculating pension, only with effect from\n\n31.3.1998, was not sustainable in law. Inasmuch as, employees who had retired\n\nbetween 1.1.1996 and 31.3.1998 would be prejudicially affected. On the same\nproposition, learned counsel placed reliance on\nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n,\n\n(1983) 1 SCC 305, and invited our attention to the following observations made\n\ntherein:-\n\n“20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a gratuitous payment\ndepending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not claimable as a\nright and, therefore, no right to pension can be enforced through Court has\nbeen swept under the carpet by the decision of the Constitution Bench\nin\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n, (1971) 2 SCC 330, wherein this\nCourt authoritatively ruled that pension is a right and the payment of it does\nnot depend upon the discretion of the Government but is governed by the\nrules and a government servant coming within those rules is entitled to claim\npension. It was further held that the grant of pension does not depend upon\nanyone's discretion. It is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having\nregard to service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the\nauthority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows\nto the officer not because of any such order but by virtue of the rules.\n\nThis\nview was reaffirmed in\nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n, (1976) 2 SCC 1”.\n\nReference was also made to\nChairman, Railway Board v. C.R. Rangadhamaiah\n,\n\n(1997) 6 SCC 623, wherefrom our attention was drawn to the following\n\nobservations:-\n\n“24. In many of these decisions the expressions “vested rights” or “accrued\nrights” have been used while striking down the impugned provisions which\nhad been given retrospective operation so as to have an adverse effect in the\nmatter of promotion, seniority, substantive appointment, etc., of the\nemployees. The said expressions have been used in the context of a right\nflowing under the relevant rule which was sought to be altered with effect from\nan anterior date and thereby taking away the benefits available under the rule\nin force at that time. It has been held that such an amendment having\nretrospective operation which has the effect of taking away a benefit already\navailable to the employee under the existing rule is arbitrary, discriminatory\nand violative of the rights guaranteed under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. We are unable to hold that these decisions are not in\nconsonance with the decisions in Roshan Lal Tandon, AIR 1967 SC\n1889, B.S. Yadav, AIR 1969 SC 118, and Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni, (1983)\n2 SCC 33.\n\n25. In these cases we are concerned with the pension payable to the\nemployees after their retirement. The respondents were no longer in service\non the date of issuance of the impugned notifications. The amendments in the\nrules are not restricted in their application in futuro. The amendments apply to\nemployees who had already retired and were no longer in service on the date\nthe impugned notifications were issued.\n26.\nIn\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n, (1971) 2 SCC 330, decided by\na Constitution Bench it has been laid down: (SCC p. 343, para 31)\n“31. … pension is not to be treated as a bounty payable on the sweet\nwill and pleasure of the Government and that the right to\nsuperannuation pension including its amount is a valuable right vesting\nin a government servant.” [p. 152]\n(emphasis supplied)\nIn that case the right to receive pension was treated as property under\nArticles\n31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\nof the Constitution.\n\n27. In D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1 SCC 305, this Court, after\ntaking note of the decision in Deokinandan Prasad (supra), has said: (SCC p.\n\n323, paras 28 and 29)\n“28. Pension to civil employees of the Government and the defence\npersonnel as administered in India appears to be a compensation for\nservice rendered in the past. However, as held in Dodge v. Board of\nEducation, 302 US 74, a pension is closely akin to wages in that it\nconsists of payment provided by an employer, is paid in consideration\nof past service and serves the purpose of helping the recipient meet the\nexpenses of living.\n\n***\n\n29. … Thus the pension payable to a government employee is earned\nby rendering long and efficient service and therefore can be said to be a\ndeferred portion of the compensation or for service rendered.”\n*** *** ***\n\n30. The respondents in these cases are employees who had retired after\n1-1-1973 and before 5-12-1988. As per Rule 2301 of the Indian Railway\nEstablishment Code they are entitled to have their pension computed in\naccordance with Rule 2544 as it stood at the time of their retirement. At that\ntime the said rule prescribed that running allowance limited to a maximum of\n75% of the other emoluments should be taken into account for the purpose of\ncalculation of average emoluments for computation of pension and other\nretiral benefits. The said right of the respondent-employees to have their\npension computed on the basis of their average emoluments being thus\ncalculated is being taken away by the amendments introduced in Rule 2544\nby the impugned notifications dated 5-12-1988 inasmuch as the maximum\nlimit has been reduced from 75% to 45% for the period from 1-1-1973 to\n31-3-1979 and to 55% from 1-4-1979 onwards. As a result the amount of\npension payable to the respondents in accordance with the rules which were\nin force at the time of their retirement has been reduced.\n\n31.\nIn\nSalabuddin Mohamed Yunus v. State of A.P.\n, (1984) Supp SCC 399,\nthe appellant was employed in the service of the former Indian State of\nHyderabad prior to coming into force of the Constitution of India. On coming\ninto force of the Constitution the appellant continued in the service of that\nState till he retired from service on 21-1-1956. The appellant claimed that he\nwas entitled to be paid the salary of a High Court Judge from 1-10-1947 and\nalso claimed that he was entitled to receive pension of Rs.1000 a month in the\nGovernment of India currency, being the maximum pension admissible under\nthe rules. The said claim of the appellant was negatived by the Government.\nHe filed a writ petition in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. During the\npendency of the said writ petition the relevant rule was amended by\nnotification dated 3-2-1971 with retrospective effect from 1-10-1954 and the\nexpression “Rs.1000 a month” in clause (b) of sub-rule (1) of Rule 299 was\nsubstituted by the expression “Rs.857.15 a month”. This amendment was\nmade in exercise of the power conferred by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nread\nwith\nArticle 313\nof the Constitution. The said amendment was struck down by\nthis Court as invalid and inoperative on the ground that it was violative of\n\nArticles 31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\nof the Constitution. Relying upon the decision\nin\nDeokinandan Prasad\n(supra), it was held: (SCC p. 406, para 6)\n“6. … The fundamental right to receive pension according to the rules in\nforce on the date of his retirement accrued to the appellant when he\nretired from service. By making a retrospective amendment to the said\nRule 299(1)(b) more than fifteen years after that right had accrued to\nhim, what was done was to take away the appellant's right to receive\npension according to the rules in force on the date of his retirement or\nin any event to curtail and abridge that right. To that extent, the said\namendment was void.”\n\n32. It is no doubt true that on 5-12-1988 when the impugned notifications\nwere issued, the rights guaranteed under\nArticles 31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\nwere not\navailable since the said provisions in the Constitution stood omitted with effect\nfrom 20-6-1979 by virtue of the\nConstitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act,\n. But Notifications Nos. GSR 1143 (E) and GSR 1144 (E) have been\nmade operative with effect from 1-1-1973 and 1-4-1979 respectively on which\ndates the rights guaranteed under\nArticles 31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\nwere available.\nBoth the notifications insofar as they have been given retrospective operation\nare, therefore, violative of the rights then guaranteed under\nArticles 19(1)\nand\n\n31(1)\nof the Constitution.\n\n33. Apart from being violative of the rights then available under\nArticles\n31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\n, the impugned amendments, insofar as they have been\ngiven retrospective operation, are also violative of the rights guaranteed under\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution on the ground that they are\nunreasonable and arbitrary since the said amendments in Rule 2544 have the\neffect of reducing the amount of pension that had become payable to\nemployees who had already retired from service on the date of issuance of\nthe impugned notifications, as per the provisions contained in Rule 2544 that\nwere in force at the time of their retirement.”\n\nBased on the above cited judgments, it was submitted, that the determination\n\nrendered by the High Court in the impugned judgment, that the\n\nrespondent-employees acquired a vested right, the moment they had subscribed to\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, was unexceptionable.\n\n31. Learned counsel for the respondent-employees also contested the submission\nadvanced on behalf of the appellants, that the right to receive pension accrues to an\n\nemployee, on the date on which he attains the age of superannuation, and not\n\nearlier. On the instant aspect of the matter it was submitted, that even though\n\npension can formally be claimed by an employee only on his retirement, the seeds\n\nfor a claim to pension are sown, and the foundation for receipt of pension is laid, the\n\nvery moment from which an employee commences to render qualifying service. It\n\nwas submitted, that based on having acquired a minimum qualifying service\n\npostulated under the rules, an employee’s claim eventually crystalises for\n\nentitlement to pension, on attaining the age of superannuation. It was contended,\n\nthat since past service rendered by an employee, constitutes the basis for grant of\n\npension, every day of service rendered by an employee, has to be taken into\n\nconsideration, for computing pension. It was accordingly urged, that every day of\n\nservice rendered by an employee, furthers the right in the employee to earn and\n\nreceive pension. For the aforesaid reasons, according to learned counsel, pension\n\nhas always been considered as deferred-wages for services rendered. It was\n\nasserted, that with effect from the date of commencement of qualifying service, the\n\nconcerned employee is treated to have an inherent vested right, for a claim to\n\npension.\nIn order to substantiate the instant contention, learned counsel placed\n\nreliance on the\nD.S. Nakara\ncase (supra), and invited our attention to the following\n\nobservations recorded therein:-\n\n“46. By our approach, are we making the scheme retroactive? The answer is\nemphatically in the negative. Take a government servant who retired on April\n1, 1979. He would be governed by the liberalised pension scheme. By that\ntime he had put in qualifying service of 35 years. His length of service is a,\nrelevant factor for computation of pension. Has the Government made it\nretroactive, 35 years backward compared to the case of a Government\nservant who retired on 30th March, 1979? Concept of qualifying service takes\nnote of length of service, and pension quantum is correlated to qualifying\nservice. Is it retroactive for 35 years for one and not retroactive for a person\nwho retired two days earlier? It must be remembered that pension is relatable\nto qualifying service. It has correlation to the average emoluments and the\nlength of service. Any liberalisation would pro tanto be retroactive in the\nnarrow sense of the term. Otherwise it is always prospective. A statute is not\nproperly called a retroactive statute because a part of the requisites for its\naction is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing, (see Craies on Statute\nLaw, sixth edition, p. 387). Assuming the Government had not prescribed the\nspecified date and thereby provided that those retiring pre and post the\nspecified date would all be governed by the liberalised pension scheme,\nundoubtedly, it would be both prospective and retroactive. Only the pension\nwill have to be recomputed in the light of the formula enacted in the liberalised\npension scheme and effective from the date the revised scheme comes into\nforce. And beware that it is not a new scheme, it is only a revision of existing\nscheme. It is not a new retiral benefit. It is an upward revision of an existing\nbenefit. If it was a wholly new concept, a new retiral benefit, one could have\nappreciated an argument that those who had already retired could not expect\nit. It could have been urged that it is an incentive to attract the fresh recruits.\nPension is a reward for past service. It is undoubtedly a condition of service\nbut not an incentive to attract new entrants because if it was to be available to\nnew entrants only, it would be prospective at such distance of thirty-five years\nsince its introduction. But it covers all those in service who entered thirty-five\nyears back. Pension is thus not an incentive but a reward for past service.\nAnd a revision of an existing benefit stands on a different footing than a new\nretiral benefit. And even in case of new retiral benefit of gratuity under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\npast service was taken into consideration.\nRecall at this stage the method adopted when pay-scales are revised.\nRevised pay-scales are introduced from a certain date. All existing employees\nare brought on to the revised scales by adopting a theory of fitments and\nincrements for past service. In other words, benefit of revised scale is not\nlimited to those who enter service subsequent to the date fixed for introducing\nrevised scales but the benefit is extended to all those in service prior to that\ndate. This is just and fair. Now if pension as we view it, is some kind of\nretirement wages for past service, can it be denied to those who retired\nearlier, revised retirement benefits being available to future retirees only.\nTherefore, there is no substance in the contention that the court by its\napproach would be making the scheme retroactive, because it is implicit in\ntheory of wages.”\n\nBased on the observations extracted above, it was submitted, that it was not open to\n\nthe State to contend, that a vested right would be created under ‘the 1999 Scheme’,\n\nonly on the date of retirement. Since pension has been recognized as\n\ndeferred-wages for past services, payable on retirement, according to learned\n\ncounsel, the moment an employee is enrolled on the pension scheme, his right to\nclaim pension, must be deemed to have materialized.\n\n32. Relying on certain paragraphs of ‘the 1999 Scheme’\n(\nreferred to above\n), it was\n\nsubmitted, that the appellants have erroneously treated the date of retirement, as\n\nthe date on which the right to pension accrued to the employees. In this behalf it\n\nwas pointed out, that the cause of action to receive pension would accrue to an\n\nemployee on the date of his retirement. However, the right to receive pension\n\ncrystalises, at the end of every successive day, and at the end of every successive\n\nmonth, and at the end of every successive year. It was pointed out, that it\n\ncrystalises and further crystalises, giving rise to an eventual claim for pension. It\n\nwas accordingly pointed out, that the date of retirement had been legally perceived,\n\nas the date on which the cause of action arose to an employee to claim pension.\n\nAccordingly it was submitted, that the date of retirement was relevant only for the\n\nlimited purpose of determining the cause of action, to receive pension.\n\nFor this,\n\nlearned counsel place reliance on\nAsger Ibrahim Amin v. Life Insurance Corporation\n\nof India\n, (2015) 10 SCALE 639, and invited our attention to the following\n\nobservations:-\n\n“3. On 8.8.1995, that is post the promulgation by the Respondent of the\nPension Rules, the Appellant enquired from the Respondent whether he was\nentitled to pension under the Pension Rules, which has been understood by\nthe Respondent as a representation for pension; the Respondent replied that\nthe request of the Appellant cannot be acceded to. The Appellant took the\nmatter no further but has averred that in 2000, prompted by news in a Daily\nand Judgments of a High Court and a Tribunal, he requested the Respondent\nto reconsider his case for pension. This request has remained unanswered. It\nwas in 2011 that he sent a legal notice to the Respondent, in response to\nwhich the Respondent reiterated its stand that the Appellant, having resigned\nfrom service, was not eligible to claim pension under the Pension Rules.\nEventually, the Appellant filed a Special Civil Application on 29.3.2012 before\nthe High Court, which was dismissed by the Single Judge vide Judgment\ndated 5.10.2012. The LPA of the Appellant also got dismissed on the grounds\nof the delay of almost 14 years, as also on merits vide Judgment dated\n1.3.2013, against which the Appellant has approached this Court.\n4. As regards the issue of delay in matters pertaining to claims of pension,\nit has already been opined by this Court in\nUnion of India v. Tarsem Singh\n,\n(2008) 8 SCC 648, that in cases of continuing or successive wrongs, delay\nand laches or limitation will not thwart the claim so long as the claim, if\nallowed, does not have any adverse repercussions on the settled third-party\nrights. This Court held:\n\n“7. To summarise, normally, a belated service related claim will be\nrejected on the ground of delay and laches (where remedy is sought by\nfiling a writ petition) or limitation (where remedy is sought by an\napplication to the Administrative Tribunal). One of the exceptions to the\nsaid rule is cases relating to a continuing wrong. Where a service\nrelated claim is based on a continuing wrong, relief can be granted\neven if there is a long delay in seeking remedy, with reference to the\ndate on which the continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing\nwrong creates a continuing source of injury. But there is an exception to\nthe exception. If the grievance is in respect of any order or\nadministrative decision which related to or affected several others also,\nand if the reopening of the issue would affect the settled rights of third\nparties, then the claim will not be entertained. For example, if the issue\nrelates to payment or refixation of pay or pension, relief may be granted\nin spite of delay as it does not affect the rights of third parties . But if the\nclaim involved issues relating to seniority or promotion, etc., affecting\nothers, delay would render the claim stale and doctrine of\nlaches/limitation will be applied. Insofar as the consequential relief of\nrecovery of arrears for a past period is concerned, the principles relating\nto recurring/successive wrongs will apply. As a consequence, the High\nCourts will restrict the consequential relief relating to arrears normally to\na period of three years prior to the date of filing of the writ petition.”\nWe respectfully concur with these observations which if extrapolated or\napplied to the factual matrix of the present case would have the effect of\nrestricting the claim for pension, if otherwise sustainable in law, to three years\nprevious to when it was raised in a judicial forum. Such claims recur month to\nmonth and would not stand extinguished on the application of the laws of\nprescription, merely because the legal remedy pertaining to the time barred\npart of it has become unavailable. This is too well entrenched in our\njurisprudence, foreclosing any fresh consideration.\n\nReliance was also placed on the decision of this Court in\nState of Madhya Pradesh\n\nv. Yogendra Shrivastava\n, (2010) 12 SCC 538, wherefrom learned counsel\n\nemphasized on the following observations:-\n\n“17. The appellants contended that the claims were therefore barred by\nlimitation. It was pointed out that the respondents were paid NPA at a fixed\nrate as stipulated in the appointment orders and NPA was increased only\nwhen it was revised by the government orders from time to time; that the\nrespondents accepted such NPA without protest; and that therefore, they\ncannot, after periods varying from 5 to 15 years, challenge the fixation of NPA\nor contend that they are entitled to NPA at a higher rate, that is 25% of their\npay.\n\n18. We cannot agree. Where the issue relates to payment or fixation of\nsalary or any allowance, the challenge is not barred by limitation or the\ndoctrine of laches, as the denial of benefit occurs every month when the\nsalary is paid, thereby giving rise to a fresh cause of action, based on\ncontinuing wrong. Though the lesser payment may be a consequence of the\nerror that was committed at the time of appointment, the claim for a higher\nallowance in accordance with the Rules (prospectively from the date of\napplication) cannot be rejected merely because it arises from a wrong fixation\nmade several years prior to the claim for correct payment. But in respect of\ngrant of consequential relief of recovery of arrears for the past period, the\nprinciple relating to recurring and successive wrongs would apply. Therefore\nthe consequential relief of payment of arrears will have to be restricted to a\nperiod of three years prior to the date of the original application. [See:\nM.R.\nGupta v. Union of India\n, 1995 (\n5) SCC 628, and Union of India v. Tarsem\nSingh\n, 2008 (8) SCC 648]”.\n\nIt was, therefore, the contention of learned counsel for the respondents, that the\n\nfoundation to claim pension, accrued in the employees of all corporate bodies in the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh (including all the respondent-employees herein), the very\n\nmoment they came to be enrolled in ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was submitted, that all\n\nexisting employees who had opted for pension or were deemed to have opted for\n\npension, had vested in themselves the right to pension when they would retire from\n\nservice. All employees who came to be engaged by corporations in the State, from\n\n1.4.1999 up to 1.12.2004, were likewise vested with the right to receive pension,\n\nbecause of the fact, that at the very inception of their employment, they became\n\nmembers of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, and the period of service rendered by them would\n\nlikewise constitute qualifying service, for pension. It was therefore submitted, that\n\nthere was a clear distinction between two contingencies, firstly, the date on which a\n\nclaim for pension can be stated to have vested in the employee, and the date on\n\nwhich the employee earns a right to receive pension. Insofar as the former is\n\nconcerned, it was submitted, that the moment qualifying service commences to add\nup, a vested right to receive pension is created. For the latter, having rendered the\n\npostulated qualifying service (on the date of superannuation), gives rise to a cause\n\nof action to receive pension. It is this fine distinction which according to learned\n\ncounsel, needs to be examined and has been overlooked during the course of the\n\nsubmissions advanced on behalf of the appellant-State.\n\n33. Insofar as the issue of financial unviability of ‘the 1999 Scheme’ is concerned,\n\nit was submitted on behalf of the respondent-employees, that the State Government\n\nwas estopped in law, from raising such a plea. In this behalf it was pointed out, that\n\nthe Law Department and the Finance Department of the State Government, had\n\nadvised, against the retrospective withdrawal of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. If the advice\n\nhad been accepted, according to learned counsel, persons similarly situated, as the\n\nprivate respondents, would have remained entitled to receive pension under ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’. Additionally it was contended, that in identical circumstances, the\n\nState Government had repealed the provisions of the Central Civil Services\n\n(Pension) Rules, 1972, as were applicable to State Government employees, through\n\na similar notification, dated 15.5.2003. It was highlighted, that the aforesaid repeal\n\nnotification, was given a prospective effect, inasmuch as, employees similarly\n\nsituated as the respondent-employees herein, who had not retired on the date of the\n\nrepeal notification, were allowed to be governed by the Central Civil Services\n\n(Pension) Rules, 1972. At the cost of clarification, it was pointed out, that the repeal\n\nnotification dated 15.5.2003, had the effect of not depriving pensionary rights to any\n\nof the existing employees. Based on the above contentions, it was submitted, that\n\nthe action of the State Government, in depriving the respondent-employees of their\n\npensionary rights, must be treated as based on an arbitrary exercise of power, and\nas such, was liable to be considered as violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n\n34. It was also the contention of learned counsel for the respondent-employees,\n\nthat pension was akin to the right of property, postulated under\narticle 300A\nof the\n\nConstitution. For the instant proposition, learned counsel placed reliance on the\n\ndecision rendered in\nState of Jharkhand v. Jitendra Kumar Srivastava\n, (2013) 12\n\nSCC 210, and invited our attention to the following observations recorded therein:-\n\n“8. It is an accepted position that gratuity and pension are not bounties. An\nemployee earns these benefits by dint of his long, continuous, faithful and\nun-blemished service. Conceptually it is so lucidly described in\nD.S. Nakara\nand Ors. v. Union of India\n, (1983) 1 SCC 305, by D.A. Desai, J., who spoke\nfor the Bench, in his inimitable style, in the following words: (SCC pp. 319-20,\nparas 18-20)\n“18. The approach of the Respondents raises a vital and none too\neasy of answer, question as to why pension is paid. And why was it\nrequired to be liberalised? Is the employer, which expression will\ninclude even the State, bound to pay pension? Is there any obligation\non the employer to provide for the erstwhile employee even after the\ncontract of employment has come to an end and the employee has\nceased to render service?\n\n19. What is a pension? What are the goals of pension? What public\ninterest or purpose, if any, it seeks to serve? If it does seek to serve\nsome public purpose, is it thwarted by such artificial division of\nretirement pre and post a certain date? We need seek answer to these\nand incidental questions so as to render just justice between parties to\nthis petition.\n\n20. The antiquated notion of pension being a bounty a gratuitous\npayment depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer not\nclaimable as a right and, therefore, no right to pension can be enforced\nthrough Court has been swept under the carpet by the decision of the\nConstitution Bench in Deoki Nandan Prasad v. State of Bihar and Ors.,\n(1971) 2 SCC 330, wherein this Court authoritatively ruled that pension\nis a right and the payment of it does not depend upon the discretion of\nthe Government but is governed by the rules and a Government\nservant coming within those rules is entitled to claim pension. It was\nfurther held that the grant of pension does not depend upon anyone's\ndiscretion. It is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having\nregard to service and other allied maters that it may be necessary for\nthe authority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive\npension flows to the officer not because of any such order but by virtue\nof the rules. This view was reaffirmed in State of Punjab and Anr. v.\nIqbal Singh, (1976) 2 SCC 1”.\n\nIt is thus hard earned benefit which accrues to an employee and is in the\nnature of \"property\". This right to property cannot be taken away without the\ndue process of law as per the provisions of\nArticle 300A\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n13. A reading of Rule 43(b) makes it abundantly clear that even after the\nconclusion of the departmental inquiry, it is permissible for the Government to\nwithhold pension etc. only when a finding is recorded either in departmental\ninquiry or judicial proceedings that the employee had committed grave\nmisconduct in the discharge of his duty while in his office. There is no\nprovision in the rules for withholding of the pension/gratuity when such\ndepartmental proceedings or judicial proceedings are still pending.\n\n14. The right to receive pension was recognized as a right to property by\nthe Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State\nof Bihar\n, (1971) 2 SCC 330, as is apparent from the following discussion:\n\n(SCC pp. 342-43, paras 27-33)\n“27. The last question to be considered, is, whether the right to receive\npension by a Government servant is property, so as to attract\n\nArticles 19(1)(f)\nand\n31(1)\nof the Constitution. This question falls to be\ndecided in order to consider whether the writ petition is maintainable\nunder\nArticle 32.\nTo this aspect, we have already adverted to earlier and\nwe now proceed to consider the same.\n\n28. According to the Petitioner the right to receive pension is property\nand the Respondents by an executive order dated 12-6-1968 have\nwrongfully withheld his pension. That order affects his fundamental\nrights under\nArticles 19(1)(f)\nand\n31(1)\nof the Constitution. The\nRespondents, as we have already indicated, do not dispute the right of\nthe Petitioner to get pension, but for the order passed on 5-8-1996.\n\nThere is only a bald averment in the counter-affidavit that no question of\nany fundamental right arises for consideration. Mr. Jha, learned\nCounsel for the Respondents, was not prepared to take up the position\nthat the right to receive pension cannot be considered to be property\nunder any circumstances. According to him, in this case, no order has\nbeen passed by the State granting pension. We understood the learned\nCounsel to urge that if the State had passed an order granting pension\nand later on resiles from that order, the latter order may be considered\nto affect the Petitioner's right regarding property so as to attract\n\nArticles 19(1)(f)\nand\n31(1)\nof the Constitution.\n\n29. We are not inclined to accept the contention of the learned\nCounsel for the Respondents. By a reference to the material provisions\nin the Pension Rules, we have already indicated that the grant of\npension does not depend upon an order being passed by the\nauthorities to that effect. It may be that for the purposes of quantifying\nthe amount having regard to the period of service and other allied\nmatters, it may be necessary for the authorities to pass an order to that\neffect, but the right to receive pension flows to an officer not because of\nthe said order but by virtue of the rules. The rules, we have already\npointed out, clearly recognise the right of persons like the petitioners to\nreceive pension under the circumstances mentioned therein.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n33. Having due regard to the above decisions, we are of the opinion\nthat the right of the Petitioner to receive pension is property under\n\nArticle 31(1)\nand by a mere executive order the State had no power to\nwithhold the same. Similarly, the said claim is also property under\n\nArticle 19(1)(f)\nand it is not saved by clause (5) of\nArticle 19.\nTherefore,\nit follows that the order dated 12-6-1968, denying the petitioner right to\nreceive pension affects the fundamental right of the petitioner under\n\nArticles 19(1)(f)\nand\n31(1)\nof the Constitution, and as such the writ\npetition under\nArticle 32\nis maintainable. It may be that under the\nPension Act (23 of 1871) there is a bar against a civil court entertaining\nany suit relating to the matters mentioned therein. That does not stand\nin the way of writ of mandamus being issued to the State to properly\nconsider the claim of the petitioner for payment of pension according to\nlaw.”\n\n16. The fact remains that there is an imprimatur to the legal principle that\nthe right to receive pension is recognized as a right in \"property\".\n\nArticle 300-A\nof the Constitution of India reads as under:\n\n“300-A. Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of\nlaw.- No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of\nlaw.”\nOnce we proceed on that premise, the answer to the question posed by us in\nthe beginning of this judgment becomes too obvious. A person cannot be\ndeprived of this pension without the authority of law, which is the\nConstitutional mandate enshrined in\nArticle 300-A\nof the Constitution. It\nfollows that attempt of the Appellant to take away a part of pension or gratuity\nor even leave encashment without any statutory provision and under the\numbrage of administrative instruction cannot be countenanced.”\n\nFor the same proposition, reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in the\n\nU.P. Raghavendra Acharya\ncase (supra). Learned counsel while seeking to adopt\n\nthe conclusions drawn by this Court\nin\nthe above case\nasserted, that the\n\nsubscription to the pensionary scheme by itself, would create a vested right in the\n\nrespondent-employees, to draw pension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\n35. At this juncture, learned counsel for the respondent-employees also placed\n\nreliance on the\nU.P. Raghavendra Acharya\ncase (supra), and invited the Court’s\n\nattention to the following:-\n\n“19. The fact that the appellants herein were treated to be on a par with the\nholders of similar posts in government colleges is neither denied nor disputed.\nThe appellants indisputably are governed by the UGC scales of pay. They are\nentitled to the pensionary benefits also. They had been given the benefits of\nthe revision of scales of pay by the 10 th Pay Revision Committee w.e.f.\n1-1-1986. The pensionary benefits payable to them on attaining the age of\nsuperannuation or death were also stated to be on a par with the employees\nof the State Government. The State of Karnataka, as noticed hereinbefore, for\nall intent and purport, has treated the teachers of the government aided\ncolleges and the regional engineering colleges on the one hand and the\nteachers of the colleges run by the State itself on the other hand on a par.\nEven the financial rules were made applicable to them in terms of the\nnotifications, applying the rule of incorporation by reference. Although Rule\n296 of the Rules per se may not be applicable so far as the appellants are\nconcerned, it now stands admitted that the provisions thereof have been\napplied to the case of the appellants also for the purpose of computation of\npensionary benefits. Therefore there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the\nterm \"Emoluments\" as contained in Rule 296 of the Rules would also apply to\nthe case of the appellants. Rule 296 of the Rules reads as under:\n\n“296. In respect of retirement or death while in service of government\nservants on or after first day of July, 1993, the term ‘emoluments’ for the\npurpose of this Chapter means, the basic pay drawn by the government\nservant in the scale of pay applicable to the post on the date of\nretirement or death and includes the following, but does not include pay\nand allowance drawn from a source other than the Consolidated Fund\nof the State,-\n\nxxx xxx xxx\nNote:- (a) Basic pay means the pay drawn in the time-scale of pay\napplicable to the post immediately before retirement or death.”\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n22. The State while implementing the new scheme for payment of grant of\npensionary benefits to its employees, may deny the same to a class of retired\nemployees who were governed by a different set of rules. The extension of\nthe benefits can also be denied to a class of employees if the same is\npermissible in law. The case of the appellants, however, stands absolutely on\na different footing. They had been enjoying the benefit of the revised scales of\npay. Recommendations have been made by the Central Government as also\nthe University Grants Commission to the State of Karnataka to extend the\nbenefits of the Pay Revision Committee in their favour. The pay in their case\nhad been revised in 1986 whereas the pay of the employees of the State of\nKarnataka was revised in 1993. The benefits of the recommendations of the\nPay Revision Committee w.e.f. 1-1-1996, thus, could not have been denied to\nthe appellants.\n\n23. The stand of the State of Karnataka that the pensionary benefits had\nbeen conferred on the appellants w.e.f. 1-4-1998 on the premise that the\nbenefit of the revision of scales of pay to its own employees had been\nconferred from 1-1-1998, in our opinion, is wholly misconceived. Firstly,\nbecause the employees of the State of Karnataka and the appellants, in the\nmatter of grant of benefit of revised scales of pay, do not stand on the same\nfooting as revised scales of pay had been made applicable to their cases from\na different date. Secondly, the appellants had been given the benefit of the\nrevised scales of pay w.e.f. 1-1-1996. It is now well settled that a notification\ncan be issued by the State accepting the recommendations of the Pay\nRevision Committee with retrospective effect as it was beneficent to the\nemployees. Once such a retrospective effect is given to the recommendations\nof the Pay Revision Committee, the employees concerned despite their\nreaching the age of superannuation in between the said dates and/or the date\nof issuance of the notification would be deemed to be getting the said scales\nof pay as on 1-1-1996. By reason of such notification, as the appellants had\nbeen derived of a vested right, they could not have been deprived therefrom\nand that too by reason of executive instructions.\n\n24. The contention of the State that the matter relating to the grant of\npensionary benefits vis-à-vis the revision in the scales of pay stands on\ndifferent footing, thus, must be rejected.\n\n25. Pension, as is well known, is not a bounty. It is treated to be a deferred\nsalary. It is akin to right of property. It is co-related and has a nexus with the\nsalary payable to the employees as on the date of retirement.\n\n26. These appeals involve the question of revision of pay and consequent\nrevision in pension and not the grant of pension for the first time. Only the\nmodality of computing the quantum of pension was required to be determined\nin terms of the notification issued by the State of Karnataka. For the said\npurpose, Rule 296 of the Rules was made applicable. Once this rule became\napplicable, indisputably the computation of pensionary benefits was required\nto be carried out in terms thereof. The Pension Rules envisage that pension\nshould be calculated only on the basis of the emoluments last drawn. No\norder, therefore, could be issued which would be contrary to or inconsistent\ntherewith. Such emoluments were to be reckoned only in terms of the\nstatutory rules. If the State had taken a conscious decision to extend the\nbenefit of the UGC pay scales w.e.f. 1-1-1996, to the appellants, allowing\nthem to draw their pay and allowances in terms thereof, we fail to see any\nreason as to why the pensionary benefits would not be extended to them from\nthe said date.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n28. The impugned order furthermore is opposed to the basic principles of\nlaw inasmuch as by reason of executive instructions an employee cannot be\ndeprived of a vested or accrued right. Such a right to draw pension to the\nextent of 50% of the emoluments, computed in terms of the rules, w.e.f.\n\n1-1-1996, vested in the appellants in terms of government notification read\nwith Rule 296 of the Rules.”\n\n36. It was also the contention of learned counsel for the respondent-employees,\n\nthat the present controversy needs to be examined from the perspective, that the\n\nrespondent-employees did not make any endeavour to claim pension as a matter of\n\nparity with Government employees, in the State of Himachal Pradesh. It was\nsubmitted, that legally such a claim would not be sustainable, because civil servants\n\nin the State of Himachal Pradesh, and employees of Government owned\n\ncorporations in the State, can not be considered as entitled to the same monetary\n\nbenefits. It was however pointed out, that insofar as the present controversy is\n\nconcerned, the State of Himachal Pradesh at its own, had granted parity to\n\nemployees of Government owned corporations on the subject of pension, with\n\nGovernment employees in the State. Examined in the above context, according to\n\nlearned counsel, it is apparent that the right of employees of Government owned\n\ncorporations, in the State of Himachal Pradesh, on the issue of pension, stood\n\nconceded in their favour, on the basis of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was in the above\n\nview of the matter, that learned counsel for the respondent-employees asserted, that\n\nthe revocation of a benefit which the State Government conceded to employees of\n\nGovernment owned corporations, was per se arbitrary, and as such, not sustainable\n\nin law.\n\n37. Learned counsel for the respondent-employees raised a plea of discrimination\n\nas well. It was submitted, that through the repeal notification dated 2.12.2004, ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’ was sought to be withdrawn for one set of employees, and was\n\nsought to be retained for another set of employees. In this behalf it was submitted,\n\nthat the action of the State Government in fixing the date of retirement, as a cut-off\n\ndate for withdrawing or sustaining pensionary benefits, is clearly unacceptable in\n\nlaw. In this behalf it was pointed out, that this Court on a number of occasions held,\n\nthat the date of retirement, cannot be a valid criterion for classification. It was\n\nsubmitted, that the fortuitous circumstance (date) of retirement, by a day earlier or a\n\nday later (than the cut-off date), would result in discriminatory consequences, for\npersons who constitute a homogenous class. It was contended, that whilst ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’ was in operation, all employees of State owned corporations who had\n\nopted for the same, constituted a homogenous class, and there could be no division\n\nto segregate such a homogenous class, so as to extend pensionary benefits to one\n\nset of employees, and to revoke the same, for another.\nIn order to support the\n\nabove contention, learned counsel for the respondents placed reliance on the\nD.S.\n\nNakara\ncase (supra) and drew our attention to the following observations recorded\n\ntherein:-\n\n“42. If it appears to be undisputable, as it does to us that the pensioners for\nthe purpose of pension benefits form a class, would its upward revision permit\na homogeneous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria\nunrelated to purpose of revision, and would such classification be founded on\nsome rational principle? The classification has to be based, as is well settled,\non some rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the\nobjects sought to be achieved. We have set out the objects underlying the\npayment of pension. If the State considered it necessary to liberalise the\npension scheme, we find no rational principle behind it for granting these\nbenefits only to those who retired subsequent to that date simultaneously\ndenying the same to those who retired prior to that date. If the liberalisation\nwas considered necessary for augmenting social security in old age to\ngovernment servants then those who retired earlier cannot be worst off than\nthose who retire later. Therefore, this division which classified pensioners into\ntwo classes is not based on any rational principle and if the rational principle\nis the one of dividing pensioners with a view to giving something more to\npersons otherwise equally placed, it would be discriminatory. To illustrate, take\ntwo persons, one retired just a day prior and another a day just succeeding\nthe specified date. Both were in the same pay bracket, the average\nemolument was the same and both had put in equal number of years of\nservice. How does a fortuitous circumstance of retiring a day earlier or a day\nlater will permit totally unequal treatment in the matter of pension? One\nretiring a day earlier will have to be subject to ceiling of Rs.8100 p.a. And\naverage emolument to be worked out on 36 months’ salary while the other will\nhave a ceiling of Rs.12,000 p.a. and average emolument will be computed on\nthe basis of last ten months’ average. The artificial division stares into face\nand is unrelated to any principle and whatever principle, if there be any, has\nabsolutely no nexus to the objects sought to be achieved by liberalising the\npension scheme. In fact this arbitrary division has not only no nexus to the\nliberalised pension scheme but it is counter productive and runs counter to the\nwhole gamut of pension scheme. The equal treatment guaranteed in\n\nArticle 14\nis wholly violated inasmuch as the pension rules being statutory in\ncharacter, since the specified date, the rules accord differential and\ndiscriminatory treatment to equals in the matter of commutation of pension. A\n48 hours’ difference in matter of retirement would have a traumatic effect.\n\nDivision is thus both arbitrary and unprincipled. Therefore the classification\ndoes not stand the test of Article 14.”\n\nOn the same proposition, reliance was placed on\nUnion of India v. SPS Vains\n\n(Retd\n.), (2008) 9 SCC 125, and the Court’s attention was invited to the following\n\nobservations:-\n\n“28. The question regarding creation of different classes within the same\ncadre on the basis of the doctrine of intelligible differentia having nexus with\nthe object to be achieved, has fallen for consideration at various intervals for\nthe High Courts as well as this Court, over the years. The said question was\ntaken up by a Constitution Bench in the case of\nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n,\n(1983) 1 SCC 305, where in no uncertain terms throughout the judgment it\nhas been repeatedly observed that the date of retirement of an employee\ncannot form a valid criterion for classification, for if that is the criterion those\nwho retired by the end of the month will form a class by themselves. In the\ncontext of that case, which is similar to that of the instant case, it was held\nthat\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution had been wholly violated, inasmuch as, the\nPension Rules being statutory in character, the amended Rules, specifying a\ncut-off date resulted in differential and discriminatory treatment of equals in\nthe matter of commutation of pension. It was further observed that it would\nhave a traumatic effect on those who retired just before that date. The division\nwhich classified pensioners into two classes was held to be artificial and\narbitrary and not based on any rational principle and whatever principle, if\nthere was any, had not only no nexus to the objects sought to be achieved by\namending the Pension Rules, but was counterproductive and ran counter to\nthe very object of the pension scheme. It was ultimately held that the\nclassification did not satisfy the test of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n29. The Constitution Bench (in\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra)), has discussed in detail\nthe objects of granting pension and we need not, therefore, dilate any further\non the said subject, but the decision in the aforesaid case has been\nconsistently referred to in various subsequent judgments of this Court, to\nwhich we need not refer. In fact, all the relevant judgments delivered on the\nsubject prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench have been considered\nand dealt with in detail in the aforesaid case. The directions ultimately given\nby the Constitution Bench in the said case in order to resolve the dispute\nwhich had arisen, is of relevance to resolve the dispute in this case also.\n\n30. However, before we give such directions we must also observe that the\nsubmissions advanced on behalf of the Union of India cannot be accepted in\nview of the decision in\nD.S. Nakara\n's case (supra). The object sought to be\nachieved was not to create a class within a class, but to ensure that the\nbenefits of pension were made available to all persons of the same class\nequally. To hold otherwise would cause violence to the provisions of\nArticle\nof the Constitution. It could not also have been the intention of the\nauthorities to equate the pension payable to officers of two different ranks by\nresorting to the step up principle envisaged in the fundamental rules in a\nmanner where the other officers belonging to the same cadre would be\nreceiving a higher pension.”\n\n38. It was therefore asserted on behalf of the respondent-employees, that the\n\nconcept of a cut-off date cannot be adopted, in case of a repeal of a pension\n\nscheme prospectively. In this behalf it was submitted, that it could not be forgotten,\n\nthat consequent upon the respondent-employees having been enrolled in ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, they had been deprived of the employer’s share of provident fund (and the\n\ninterest which had accrued, thereon). The same ought to be treated as\n\nconsideration, which passed from the respondent-employees to the State\n\nGovernment, consequent upon their enrollment into ‘the 1999 Scheme’. On account\n\nof having foregone the employer’s contribution which was a pre-requisite for\n\nenrollment in ‘the 1999 Scheme’, it was submitted, that the respondent-employees\n\nmust be deemed to have contributed by way of consideration, to earn the benefit\n\nwhich would accrue to them, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. Keeping the above legal\n\nproposition in mind, it was pointed out, that the action of the State Government in\n\ndepriving the respondent-employees of pensionary benefits, while allowing the same\n\nto such of the employees, who had retired on or before 2.12.2004, was\n\ndiscriminatory and unsustainable in law. It was also the contention of learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent-employees, that the only situation where a claim for\n\npension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’ could have been legally denied, is when a\n\nsucceeding pension scheme introduced by the employer, postulated better retiral\n\nbenefits.\n\n39. Reliance was also placed on\nPepsu Road Transport Corporation, Patiala v.\nMangal Singh\n, (2011) 11 SCC 702, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n“48. The concept of “pension” has also been considered in Corpus Juris\nSecundum, Vol. 70, at p. 423 as thus:\n\n“A pension is a periodical allowance of money granted by the\ngovernment in consideration or recognition of meritorious past services,\nor of loss or injury sustained in the public service. A pension is mainly\ndesigned to assist the pensioner in providing for his daily wants, and it\npresupposes the continued life of the recipient.”\n\nBased on the above, it was the contention of learned counsel, that the State\n\nGovernments’ inference, based on the report of the Committee, dated 15.11.2003,\n\nthat ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was not viable, was clearly unacceptable. In this behalf,\n\nlearned counsel invited the Court’s attention to the following observations, recorded\n\nin the said report:-\n\n“14. After determining the magnitude of inflows and outflows, the\nsustainability of the corpus has been analysed assuming average interest\nincome from corpus investment at various levels of interest over a period of\n10 years. The highest rate of interest has been assumed to be 6.5% and the\nlowest 5.5%. In each scenario, the net surplus available for ploughing back\ninto the pension fund starts declining from the 6 th year onwards. This is\nessentially due to the fact that with dwindling fresh recruitments, the pension\nliabilities will continue to increase over the years, but the inflows would decline\ndue to reduced contributions. Details of the calculations are as under:-\n\n5.5% Annexure-F\n5.75% Annexure-F-I\n6.00% Annexure-F-II\n6.25% Annexure-F-III\n6.50% Annexure-F-IV”\n\nIt was submitted, that there was no legitimate basis for recording such a conclusion.\n\n40. It was also the contention of learned counsel, that the judgment rendered by\n\nthe High Court, rightly negated the financial impact of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, because\n\nin terms of the conclusions drawn in the judgment, the same would not be applicable\n\nto future employees. And the deficiency in the financial resources was accordingly\n\nfastened on the State Government. On the issue in hand, it was submitted, that a\n\nnumber of employees, who became members of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, and would\nretire after 2.12.2004 (i.e. the cut-off date, determined under the repeal notification,\n\ndated 2.12.2004) is a definite number. In this behalf it was pointed out, that if the\n\nemployees, who became members of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, are to be taken into\n\nconsideration, there would be 6,730 employees, who would draw pension on their\n\nretirement. It was accordingly submitted, that there would be no further increase in\n\nthe liability under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. In order to demonstrate that the available\n\nfunds accumulated on account of the employee’s contribution to the EPF/CPF\n\nconcerned, were sufficient to meet the liability, to administer the pension scheme, it\n\nwas submitted, that the same has increased from 56 crores in 2003 to 253 crores in\n\n2015. It was pointed out, that the aforesaid figures emerged, despite the withdrawal\n\nof provident fund amounts, by a number of employees. It was, therefore submitted,\n\nthat payment of pensionary benefits to 6,730 employees, was well within the\n\nfinancial reach of the State Government, and that, the decision of the State\n\nGovernment to issue the repeal notification, on the ground that ‘the 1999 Scheme’\n\nwas not financially viable, was not acceptable.\n\n41. It was also the contention of learned counsel for the respondent-employees,\n\nthat all the State owned corporations were fully controlled by the Government. All\n\nshares in the corporations were held by the State Government. The management of\n\nall the corporations, was also under the direct control and supervision of the\n\nGovernment. Accordingly it was submitted, that the ultimate authority in determining\n\nthe conditions of service of the concerned corporations, was vested with the\n\nGovernment. In this behalf, reliance was placed on\nArticles 51\nand\nof Articles of\n\nAssociation of the Himachal Pradesh State Forest Development Corporation\n\nLimited. It was highlighted that similar Articles of Association governed the other\ncorporations, as well. It was therefore submitted, that the State Government, had no\n\nbusiness, to withdraw itself, from its responsibility and commitment.\n\n42. It was, therefore submitted, that the Government has consistently been\n\nextending the benefit of similar conditions of service, to employees of Government\n\nowned corporations, as are available to Government employees in the State. The\n\nGovernment having taken a conscious decision to extend pensionary benefits to all\n\nemployees of Government owned corporations, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, is clearly\n\nprecluded from withdrawing the same, specially on account of the fact, that the\n\ncorporations under consideration, are instrumentalities of the State in terms of\n\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of India. According to learned counsel, ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’ was liable to be treated as a welfare measure, extended by the State\n\nGovernment to all employees, and therefore, it should not shirk its responsibility, to\n\nfulfill any financial deficiency therein, out of the Government treasury. In the above\n\nview of the matter it was submitted, that the impugned judgment rendered by the\n\nHigh Court, deserved no interference.\n\n43. It was also asserted, that even if it was assumed, that the report of the\n\ncommittee, dated 15.11.2003, with reference to the status of the corpus fund, is\n\ncorrect, still the same is liable to be rejected because the committee had sought\n\nviews of 17 corporations/boards covered by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, however, it received\n\nviews of 7 corporations only, namely, Himachal Pradesh Agro Industries\n\nCorporation, Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation, Himachal\n\nPradesh State Industrial Development Corporation, Himachal Pradesh Horticultural\n\nProduce Marketing and Processing Corporation Ltd., Himachal Pradesh Housing\n\nBoard, Himachal Pradesh State Forest Development Corporation Ltd., and\nHimachal Pradesh SC & ST Development Corporation. The above corporations had\n\nexpressed the opinion, that a unified trust for pension with financial support of the\n\nState Government, could salvage the financial position, to enable the corpus fund to\n\ncater to payment of pension to employees under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was\n\ntherefore the contention of learned counsel for the respondents, that credence\n\nshould not be given to the proposition propounded at the hands of the State\n\nGovernment, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was not financially viable.\n\n44. In order to controvert the submissions advanced at the hands of learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent-employees, Mr. P.P. Rao, learned senior counsel\n\nemphatically pointed out, that all the judgments relied upon by the respondents were\n\ninapplicable to the present controversy. It was submitted, that the judgments relied\n\nupon, did not deal with the rights of serving employees. It was pointed out, that a\n\nclear enunciation in this behalf was recorded by this Court, that the prayers raised at\n\nthe hands of the respondent-employees, could only relate to superannuated\n\npersonnel. For the above, learned counsel invited our attention to the\nChairman,\n\nRailway Board\ncase (supra), wherefrom the following observations were relied\n\nupon:-\n\n“20. It can, therefore, be said that a rule which operates in futuro so as to\ngovern future rights of those already in service cannot be assailed on the\nground of retroactivity as being violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution, but a rule which seeks to reverse from an anterior date a benefit\nwhich has been granted or availed of, e.g., promotion or pay scale, can be\nassailed as being violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution to the\nextent it operates retrospectively.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n25. In these cases we are concerned with the pension payable to the\nemployees after their retirement. The respondents were no longer in service\non the date of issuance of the impugned notifications. The amendments in the\nrules are not restricted in their application in futuro. The amendments apply to\nemployees who had already retired and were no longer in service on the date\nthe impugned notifications were issued.\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n30. The respondents in these cases are employees who had retired after\n1-1-1973 and before 5-12-1988. As per Rule 2301 of the Indian Railway\nEstablishment Code they are entitled to have their pension computed in\naccordance with Rule 2544 as it stood at the time of their retirement. At that\ntime the said rule prescribed that Running Allowance limited to a maximum of\n75% of the other emoluments should be taken into account for the purpose of\ncalculation of average emoluments for computation of pension and other\nretiral benefits. The said right of the respondent-employees to have their\npension computed on the basis of their average emoluments being thus\ncalculated is being taken away by the amendments introduced in Rule 2544\nby the impugned notifications dated 5-12-1988 inasmuch as the maximum\nlimit has been reduced from 75% to 45% for the period from 1-1-1973 to\n31-3-1979 and to 55% from1-4-1979 onwards. As a result the amount of\npension payable to the respondents in accordance with the rules which were\nin force at the time of their retirement has been reduced.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n33. Apart from being violative of the rights then available under\n\nArticles 31(1)\nand\n19(1)(f)\n, the impugned amendments, insofar as they have\nbeen given retrospective operation, are also violative of the rights guaranteed\nunder\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution on the ground that they are\nunreasonable and arbitrary since the said amendments in Rule 2544 have the\neffect of reducing the amount of pension that had become payable to\nemployees who had already retired from service on the date of issuance of\nthe impugned notifications, as per the provisions contained in Rule 2544 that\nwere in force at the time of their retirement.\n\n34. The learned Additional Solicitor General has, however, submitted that\nthe impugned amendments cannot be regarded as arbitrary for the reason\nthat by the reduction of the maximum limit in respect of Running Allowance\nfrom 75% to 45% for the period 1-1-1973 to 31-3-1974 and to 55% from\n1-4-1979 onwards, the total amount of pension payable to the employees has\nnot been reduced. The submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General\nis that since the pay scales had been revised under the 1973 Rules with effect\nfrom 1-1-1973, the maximum limit of 45% or 55% of the Running Allowance\nwill have to be calculated on the basis of the revised pay scales while earlier\nthe maximum limit of 75% of Running Allowance was being calculated on the\nbasis of unrevised pay scales and, therefore, it cannot be said that there has\nbeen any reduction in the amount of pension payable to the respondents as a\nresult of the impugned amendments in Rule 2544 and it cannot be said that\ntheir rights have been prejudicially affected in any manner. We are unable to\nagree. As indicated earlier, Rule 2301 of the Indian Railway Establishment\nCode prescribes in express terms that a pensionable railway servant's claim\nto pension is regulated by the rules in force at the time when he resigns or is\ndischarged from the service of Government. The respondents who retired\nafter 1-1-1973 but before 5-12-1988 were, therefore, entitled to have their\npension computed on the basis of Rule 2544 as it stood on the date of their\nretirement.\nUnder Rule 2544, as it stood prior to amendment by the impugned\nnotifications, pension was required to be computed by taking into account the\nrevised pay scales as per the 1973 Rules and the average emoluments were\nrequired to be calculated on the basis of the maximum limit of Running\nAllowance at 75% of the other emoluments, including the pay as per the\nrevised pay scales under the 1973 Rules. Merely because the respondents\nwere not paid their pension on that basis in view of the orders of the Railway\nBoard dated 21-1-1974, 22-3-1976 and 23-6-1976, would not mean that the\npension payable to them was not required to be computed in accordance with\nRule 2544 as it stood on the date of their retirement. Once it is held that\npension payable to such employees had to be computed in accordance with\nRule 2544 as it stood on the date of their retirement, it is obvious that as a\nresult of the amendments which have been introduced in Rule 2544 by the\nimpugned notifications dated 5-12-1988 the pension that would be payable\nwould be less than the amount that would have been payable as per Rule\n2544 as it stood on the date of retirement. The Full Bench of the Tribunal has,\nin our opinion, rightly taken the view that the amendments that were made in\nRule 2544 by the impugned notifications dated 5-12-1988, to the extent the\nsaid amendments have been given retrospective effect so as to reduce the\nmaximum limit from 75% to 45% in respect of the period from 1-1-1973 to\n31-3-1979 and reduce it to 55% in respect of the period from 1-4-1979, are\nunreasonable and arbitrary and are violative of the rights guaranteed under\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.”\n\nFor the same proposition, reliance was placed on the\nU.P. Raghavendra Acharya\n\ncase (supra), wherefrom our attention was drawn to the following observations:-\n\n“2. The appellants in these appeals are retired teachers of the University\nand Private Aided Colleges (to whom UGC scales of pay were applicable).\nThey have retired during the period 1.1.1996 to 31.3.1998. So far as the\nteachers of the University or Privates Aided Colleges are concerned,\nindisputably, they were being paid the same salary as was being paid to the\nteachers of the Government colleges. The appellants in Civil Appeal No.\n1391/2006, have retired from the Karnataka Regional Engineering College,\nSurathkal, Karnataka, which was established by the Government of India at\nthe request of the Government of Karnataka. It is a Centrally aided institution\nas envisaged under Entry 64 of List 1 of the Seventh Schedule to the\nConstitution of India. So far as the said institution is concerned, its\nexpenditure used to be borne by the Government of India and the State of\nKarnataka. It, however, has been notified by the Government of India as a\nDeemed University with effect from 26.6.2002.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n31. The appellants had retired from service. The State therefore could not\nhave amended the statutory rules adversely affecting their pension with\nretrospective effect.”\n\n45. A different projection was sought to be made by Mr. R. Venkataramani,\n\nlearned senior counsel, who also represented the appellants. Learned counsel,\nplaced reliance on\nState of Assam v. Barak Upatyaka D.U. Karmachari Sanstha\n,\n\n(2009) 5 SCC 694, and drew our attention to the following:-\n\n“2. By that order the Division Bench upheld the order dated 23.12.1999 of\nthe learned Single Judge in Civil Rule No. 2996/1995 allowing the\nrespondent's writ petition and directing the state government to sanction\nfinancial assistance by way of grant-in-aid to Cachar and Karimganj District\nMilk Producers' Cooperative Union Limited (“CAMUL”, for short) so as to\nenable CAMUL to make regular payment of monthly salaries, allowances as\nalso the arrears to its employees.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n4. It is contended that the State Government had all-pervasive control over\nthe affairs and management of CAMUL and therefore it should be treated as a\ndepartment of the Government of Assam, though registered as a co-operative\nsociety by lifting the corporate veil. It was further contended that State\nGovernment was responsible and liable to pay the salaries and emoluments\nof the employees of CAMUL and it was not justified in withholding the grant\namount.\n\n5. The respondent Union therefore sought a direction to the State\nGovernment to release the arrears of pay and allowances of employees of\nCAMUL with effect from December 1994 and for a direction to continue to pay\nthe salary and allowances to the employees of CAMUL, every month in future.\n\nIn addition to the state government (Respondent 1) and its officers\n(Respondents 2 to 4), the Union of India (Respondent 5) and CAMUL and its\nManaging Director (Respondents 6 and 7) were impleaded as parties to the\nwrit petition.\n\n6. The State Government opposed the petition. It inter-alia contended that\nthe grant-in-aid was extended for helping CAMUL in its different development\nactivities; that under a Centrally sponsored scheme, between 1981 to 1986,\nthe earmarked amount was released on 50:50 basis by the Central and State\nGovernment with 70% loan component and 30% as grant component; that\nthough the loan component was not repaid by CAMUL, the State Government\ncontinued the grant-in-aid for purposes of development activities; that the\nState Government had also provided Rs.43.60 lakhs for developing the\nmilk-processing infrastructure of CAMUL; that despite such assistance,\nCAMUL became defunct and stopped all its activities and thereafter the\nSilchar Town Milk Supply Project was being run by the State's Dairy\nDevelopment Department itself; that at no time, the State Government made\nany commitment or agreed to bear the salaries of employees of CAMUL or\nany other similar societies; that CAMUL had to generate its own funds and\nresources to pay the salaries of its staff; and that as there was no relationship\nof employer and employee between the State Government and the\nemployees of CAMUL, it was not responsible to bear or pay any amount\ntowards the salaries of the employees of CAMUL.\n\n7. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition. He held that the\nState Government through its Veterinary Department undertook the Integrated\nCattle Development Projects (ICDP) in various districts of Assam; and as a\npart of the said project, an ICDP block was created at Ghungoor, Silchar in\nCachar district; that 32 cooperative societies of Milk Producers were\nestablished and CAMUL was formed as an Apex Body of those co-operative\nsocieties; that the Dairy Development Department of the State Government\nhad been providing grant-in-aid earmarked in the State budget every year to\nCAMUL; that the State Government failed to offer any explanation or reason\nfor stopping the grant-in-aid from 1994; that the Dairy Development Project at\nSilchar was purely a State Government scheme and as that Project has not\nbeen discontinued and as there was no decision to bar CAMUL from receiving\ngrant-in-aid which was being granted from 1982-83 till 1994, the State\nGovernment could not deny the grant-in-aid amount. Consequently, the\nlearned Single Judge directed release of the grand-in-aid for paying monthly\nsalaries and allowances along with arrears to the employees.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n10. CAMUL indisputably is a co-operative society registered under the\nprovisions of the\nAssam Cooperative Societies Act, 1949\n. Section 85 of the\nsaid Act provides that every registered society shall be deemed to be a body\ncorporate by the name under which it is registered, with perpetual succession\nand a common seal, and with power to hold property, to enter into contracts,\ninstitute and defend suits and other legal proceedings and to do all things\nnecessary for the purposes for which it was constituted.\n\n11. Therefore, CAMUL, even if it was “State” for purposes of\nArticle 12\n, was\nan independent juristic entity and could not have been identified with or\ntreated as the State Government. In the view we have taken, it is not\nnecessary in this case to examine whether CAMUL was “State” for purposes\nof\nArticle 12.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n14. The respondent has not been able to show any right in the employees\nof CAMUL against the State Government, or any obligation on the part of the\nState Government with reference to the salaries/emoluments of employees of\nCAMUL either under any statute or contract or otherwise.\n\n15. The learned Counsel for the respondent contended that the same issue\narose for consideration in\nKapila Hingorani (I) v. State of Bihar\n, (2003) 6 SCC\n1 (for short “Kapila Hingorani (I)”) and the issue has been answered in their\nfavour. Reference is invited to the following question, which was set down as\none of the questions arising for consideration\nin that case\n: (SCC p.17, para\n\n20)\n“2. Whether having regard to the admitted position that the\ngovernment companies or corporations referred to hereinbefore are\n“State” within the meaning of\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of India, the\nState of Bihar having deep and pervasive control over the affairs\nthereof, can be held to be liable to render all assistance to the said\ncompanies so as to fulfill its own and/or the corporations' obligations to\ncomply with the citizens' rights under\nArticles 21\nand\nof the\nConstitution of India?”\n\n16. Reference is also invited to the following observations of this Court in\nconsidering the said question (Kapila Hingorani (I), SCC, pp. 20-21, paras\n30-31 & 33-34):\n“30. The government companies/public sector undertakings being\n‘State’ would be constitutionally liable to respect life and liberty of all\npersons in terms of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. They,\ntherefore, must do so in cases of their own employees. The\nGovernment of the State of Bihar for all intent and purport is the sole\nshareholder. Although in law, its liability towards the debtors of the\ncompany may be confined to the shares held by it but having regard to\nthe deep and pervasive control it exercises over the government\ncompanies; in the matter of enforcement of human rights and/or rights\nof the citizen to life and liberty, the State has also an additional duty to\nsee that the rights of employees of such corporations are not infringed.\n\n31. The right to exercise deep and pervasive control would in its turn\nmake the Government of Bihar liable to see that the life and liberty\nclause in respect of the employees is fully safeguarded. The\nGovernment of the State of Bihar, thus, had a constitutional obligation\nto protect the life and liberty of the employees of the government-owned\ncompanies/corporations who are the citizens of India. It had an\nadditional liability having regard to its right of extensive supervision over\nthe affairs of the company.\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n33. The State having regard to its right of supervision and/or deep\nand pervasive control, cannot be permitted to say that it did not know\nthe actual state of affairs of the State Government undertakings and/or\nit was kept in the dark that the salaries of their employees had not been\npaid for years leading to starvation death and/or commission of suicide\nby a large number of employees. Concept of accountability arises out of\nthe power conferred on an authority.\n\n34. The State may not be liable in relation to the day-to-day\nfunctioning of the companies, but its liability would arise on its failure to\nperform the constitutional duties and functions by the public sector\nundertakings, as in relation thereto lie the State's constitutional\nobligations. The State acts in a fiduciary capacity. The failure on the part\nof the State in a case of this nature must also be viewed from the angle\nthat the statutory authorities have failed and/or neglected to enforce the\nsocial-welfare legislations enacted in this behalf e.g. the\nPayment of\nWages Act, the Minimum Wages Act\netc. Such welfare activities as\nadumbrated in part IV of the Constitution of India indisputably would\ncast a duty upon the State being a welfare State and its statutory\nauthorities to do all things which they are statutorily obligated to\nperform.\n\nReference is invited to the fact that this Court directed the Bihar\ngovernment to release Rs. 50 crores and deposit it with the High Court\nfor disbursing salaries of employees of government\ncorporations/companies. The contention of respondent is that the\ndirection of the High Court, is in consonance with the said view.\n\n17. The learned Counsel for the respondent also relied upon the following\nobservations in\nKapila Hingorani (II) v. State of Bihar\n, (2005) 2 SCC 262 (for\nshort “Kapila Hingorani (II)): (SCC p. 268, paras 26-27)\n“26. We, therefore, do not appreciate the stand taken by the State of\nBihar now that it does not have any constitutional obligation towards a\nsection of citizens viz. the employees of the public sector undertakings\nwho have not been paid salaries for years.\n\n27. We also do not appreciate the submissions made on behalf of the\nState of Bihar that the directions issued were only one-time direction. In\nClause 4 of the directions, it was clearly stated that the State for the\npresent shall deposit a sum of Rs. 50 crores before the High Court for\ndisbursement of salaries to the employees of the corporations.\nFurthermore, the matter had been directed to be placed again after six\nmonths.”\nThis Court also issued further interim directions to the State of Bihar to\ndeposit a further sum of Rs.50 crores and the State of Jharkhand to deposit a\nsum of Rs.25 crores to meet the arrears of salaries of public sector\nundertakings.\n\n18. We have carefully examined the said two decisions. The two decisions\nare interim orders made in a writ petition under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution.\nThe said orders have not finally decided the issues/questions raised, nor\nlaid\ndown by\nany principle of law. The observations extracted above as also other\nobservations and directions are purely tentative as will be evident from the\nfollowing observations in Kapila Hingorani (I): (SCC pp. 34-35, paras 74 & 76)\n“74. We, however hasten to add that we do not intend to lay down a\nlaw, as at present advised, that the State id directly or vicariously liable\nto pay salaries/remunerations of the employees of the public sector\nundertakings or the government companies in all situations. We, as\nexplained hereinbefore, only say that the State cannot escape its\nliability when a human rights problem of such magnitude involving the\nstarvation deaths and/or suicide by the employees has taken place by\nreason of non-payment of salary to the employees of public sector\nundertakings for such a long time. …\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n76. This order shall be subject to any order that may be passed\nsubsequently or finally.”\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n19. The position is further made clear in Kapila Hingorani (II) as under:\n\n(SCC p. 270, para 37)\n“37. We make it clear that we have not issued the aforementioned\ndirections to the States of Bihar and Jharkhand on the premise that they\nare bound to pay the salaries of the employees of the public sector\nundertakings but on the ground that the employees have a human right\nas also a fundamental right under\nArticle 21\nwhich the States are bound\nto protect. The directions, which have been issued by this Court on\n9.5.2003 as also which are being issued herein, are in furtherance of\nthe human and fundamental rights of the employees concerned and not\nby way of an enforcement of their legal right to arrears of salaries. The\namount of salary payable to the employees or workmen concerned\nwould undoubtedly be adjudicated upon in the proper proceedings.\n\nHowever, these directions are issued which are necessary for their\nsurvival.”\n\n20. It is thus clear that directions were not based on legal right of the\nemployees, but were made to meet a human right problem involving\nstarvation deaths and suicides. But in the case on hand, relief is claimed and\ngranted by proceeding on the basis that the employees of corporations/bodies\nanswering the definition of “State” have a legal right to get their salaries from\nthe State Government. In fact Kapila Hingorani (I) and Kapila Hingorani\n(II) specifically negative such a right.”\n\n46. We shall now endeavour to consider the various legal parameters on the\n\nbasis whereof, learned counsel for the rival parties have premised their respective\n\nsubmissions.\n\n47. First and foremost, it is essential for us to determine whether or not a vested\n\nright came to be created in the employees of the corporate bodies, when they came\n\nto be governed by ‘the 1999 Scheme’. The submission at the hands of learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant-State was, that no such vested right was created, by the\n\ntime the repeal notification was issued on 2.12.2004. The contention of learned\n\ncounsel representing the State was, that under paragraph 4 of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, a\n\nright to draw pension would emerge, only when a concerned employee attained the\n\nage of superannuation, subject to the condition that he had rendered the postulated\n\nqualifying service. It was submitted, that prior to the fulfillment of the aforesaid\n\ncondition, no employee under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, could be considered as being\n\npossessed of a vested right, to receive pension.\n\n48. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the aforesaid submission, we are\n\nof the view, that such of the employees who had exercised their option to be\n\ngoverned by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, came to be regulated by the said scheme,\n\nimmediately on their having submitted their option. In addition to the above, all such\n\nemployees who did not exercise any option (whether to be governed, by the\n\nEmployees’ Provident Funds Scheme, 1995, or by ‘the 1999 Scheme’), would\nautomatically be deemed to have opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’. All new entrants\n\nwould naturally be governed by ‘the 1999 Scheme’. All those who had moved from\n\nthe provident fund scheme to the pension scheme, would be deemed to have\n\nconsciously, foregone all their rights under the Employees’ Provident Funds\n\nScheme, 1995. It is of significance, that all the concerned employees by moving to\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, accepted, that the employer’s contribution to their provident fund\n\naccount (and the accrued interest thereon, upto 31.3.1999), should be transferred to\n\nthe corpus, out of which their pensionary claims, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’ would be\n\nmet. It is therefore not possible for us to accept, that the concerned employees\n\nwould be governed by ‘the 1999 Scheme’ only from the date on which they attained\n\nthe age of superannuation, and that too - subject to the condition that they fulfilled\n\nthe prescribed qualifying service, entitling them to claim pension. Every fresh\n\nentrant has the statutory protection under the\nProvident Fund Act\n. All fresh entrants\n\nafter the introduction of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, were extended the benefits of ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, because of the exemption granted by competent authority under the\n\nProvident Fund Act\n. They too, therefore possessed similar rights as the optees.\n\n49. With effect from 1.4.1999, the employees who had opted for ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’ (or, who were deemed to have opted for the same) were no longer\n\ngoverned by the provisions of the\nProvident Fund Act\n(under which they had\n\nstatutory protection, for the payment of provident fund). Consequent upon an\n\nexemption having been granted to the concerned corporate bodies by the\n\ncompetent authority under the\nProvident Fund Act\n, the Employees Provident Funds\n\nScheme, 1995, was replaced, by ‘the 1999 Scheme’. All direct entrants after\n\n1.4.1999, were also entitled to the rights and privileges of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. We\nare therefore of the considered view, that the submissions advanced on behalf of the\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh premised on the assertion, that no vested right accrued\n\nto the employees of the concerned corporate bodies, on the date when ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’ became operational (with effect from 1.4.1999), or to the direct entrants\n\nwho entered service thereafter, cannot be accepted. In this behalf it would also be\n\nrelevant to emphasize, that as soon as the concerned employees came to be\n\ngoverned by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, a contingent right came to be vested in them. The\n\nsaid contingent right created a right in the employees to claim pension, at the time of\n\ntheir retirement. Undoubtedly, the aforesaid contingent right would crystalise only\n\nupon the fulfillment of the postulated conditions, expressed on behalf of the\n\nappellants (on having rendered, the postulated qualifying service). However, once\n\nsuch a contingent right was created, every employee in whom the said right was\n\ncreated, could not be prevented or forestalled, from fulfilling the postulated\n\nconditions, to claim pension. Any action pre-empting the right to pension, emerging\n\nout of the conscious option exercised by the employees, to be governed by ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’ (or to the direct entrants after the introduction of ‘the 1999 Scheme’),\n\nmost definitely did vest a right in the respondent-employees.\n\n50. We are also of the view, that there is merit in the contention advanced on\n\nbehalf of the respondent-employees, inasmuch as, the seeds of the right to receive\n\npension, emerge from the very day, an employee enters a pensionable service.\n\nFrom that very date, the employee commences to accumulate qualifying service.\n\nHis claim for pension would obviously crystalise, when he acquires the minimum\n\nprescribed qualifying service, and also, does not suffer a disqualification, disentitling\n\nhim to a claim for pension.\n51. In the above view of the matter, it is not possible for us to accept, that the\n\nrights of the concerned employees under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, can be stated to get\n\nvested, only on the date when a concerned employee would attain the age of\n\nsuperannuation, and satisfy all the pre-requisites for a claim towards pension. We\n\nare also persuaded to accept the contention advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees, that the cause of action to raise a claim for pension, would\n\narise on the date when a concerned employee actually retires from service. Any\n\nemployee governed by a pension scheme, enrolls to earn qualifying service,\n\nimmediately on his enrolment into the pensionable service. Every such employee\n\nmust be deemed to have commenced to invest in his eventual claim for pension,\n\nfrom the very day he enters service. More so, in the present controversy, by having\n\nexpressly chosen to forego his rights, under the Employees’ Provident Funds\n\nScheme, 1995.\n\n52. We shall deal with the issue, whether or not such a contingent right, as was\n\nvested in the respondent-employees on their having opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’ (or\n\nin the fresh entrants, on their very appointment), was binding and irrevocable, at a\n\nlater stage of our consideration.\n\n53. The second most important issue which deserves to be addressed by us, in\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the present case is, whether or not the State\n\nGovernment was justified in postulating a cut-off date, by which some of the\n\nemployees governed by ‘the 1999 Scheme’ (those who had retired prior to\n\n2.12.2004) were entitled to draw pension under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, whereas others,\n\nwho had not retired by the time the repeal notification was issued on 2.12.2004,\n\nwere deprived of such benefits. In this behalf, the contention of the learned counsel\nfor the respondent-employees was, that all those who had opted (or deemed to have\n\nopted) for ‘the 1999 Scheme’, and all the new entrants after the introduction of ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’, constituted a homogenous class, and it was impermissible for the\n\nState Government, to have treated them differently. It was submitted, that the\n\naforesaid classification was invidious, inasmuch as, there was no reasonable basis\n\nfor such classification, nor was there any discernable object, for bifurcating the\n\nhomogenous class of pensioners. It was submitted, that whilst those who had\n\nretired on the date of the repeal notification, would be entitled to pensionary\n\nbenefits, those who retired on the following day, would be deprived of the same.\n\nLearned counsel for the rival parties have, relied on a series of judgments in support\n\nof the respective propositions canvassed by them. We have extracted the same,\n\nwhile recording their submissions.\n\n54. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the issue canvassed, and having\n\ngone through the judgments cited, we are of the considered view, that this Court has\n\nrepeatedly upheld a cut-off date, for extending better and higher pensionary\n\nbenefits, based on the financial health of the employer. A cut-off date can therefore\n\nlegitimately be prescribed for extending pensionary benefits, if the funds available\n\ncannot assuage the liability, to all the existing pensioners. We are therefore satisfied\n\nto conclude, that it is well within the authority of the State Government, in exercise of\n\nits administrative powers (which it exercised, by issuing the impugned repeal\n\nnotification dated 2.12.2004) to fix a cut-off date, for continuing the right to receive\n\npension in some, and depriving some others of the same. This right was\n\nunquestionably exercised by the State Government, as determined by this Court, in\n\nthe\nR.R. Verma\ncase (supra), wherein this Court held, that the Government was\nvested with the inherent power to review. And that the Government was free to alter\n\nits earlier administrative decisions and policy. Surely, this is what the State\n\nGovernment has done in the present controversy. But this Court in the above\n\nmentioned judgment, placed a rider on the exercise of such power by the\n\nGovernment. In that, the exercise of such power, should be in consonance with all\n\nlegal and statutory obligations.\n\n55. It is equally true, that the power of administrative review can only be\n\nexercised, for a good and valid justification. Such justification besides being\n\nfounded on reasonable consideration, should also not be violative of any legal right -\n\nstatutory or constitutional, vested in the affected employees. Insofar as the\n\npermissibility of the administrative action taken, in issuing the impugned repeal\n\nnotification dated 2.12.2004 is concerned, whether the said power was exercised by\n\nthe State Government for good and valid reasons, and/or whether the same violated\n\nany statutory or constitutional right vested in the respondent-employees, shall be\n\nexamined by us in the succeeding paragraphs.\n\n56.\nIn order to demonstrate, that the repeal notification dated 2.12.2004, was\n\nimpermissible in law, reliance was placed on the\nU.P. Raghavendra Acharya\ncase\n\n(supra). We are of the view, that the above judgment does not have any bearing on\n\nthe facts and circumstances of this case. In the above judgment, the primary\n\ncontention which weighed with this Court, in rejecting the contention advanced by\n\nthe State Government was, that through an executive determination (by a letter,\n\ndated 17.12.1993), the State Government had breached a statutory rule, regulating\n\nthe fixation of pension (Rule 296, of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules). The above\n\nposition is not available in the present case, inasmuch as, no contention has been\nadvanced at the behest of the respondent-employees, that the action taken by the\n\nState Government (in issuing the repeal notification, dated 2.12.2004), violated any\n\nlegal obligation or statutory right.\n\nSo also, the judgment relied upon on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees in the\nD.S. Nakara\ncase (supra), wherein the employees’\n\nclaim for pension, was based on existing rules.\n\nAnd even so, in the\nChairman,\n\nRailway Board\ncase (supra), wherein it was held, that vested rights under the rules,\n\ncould not be taken away. It would also be relevant to mention, that in the last\n\njudgment\nreferred to above\n, it was observed, that the employees who had retired\n\nfrom service, had been deprived of their pensionary rights, as the amended rule was\n\nnot prospective, but was retrospective. In the instant case, the repeal notification\n\ndoes not adversely affect those employees who had retired prior to 2.12.2004,\n\nbefore the said notification was issued. The above referred judgment is also,\n\ntherefore inapplicable to the present controversy. The conclusion recorded\n\nhereinabove, also emerges on a perusal of paragraphs 31 and 33 of the above\n\njudgment. It is therefore apparent, that the validity of the impugned notification\n\ncannot be assailed on the basis of the judgments cited above. We shall now deal\n\nwith the legal submissions advanced on behalf of the respondent-employees, in\n\ntheir attempt to invalidate the repeal notification, dated 2.12.2004.\n\n57. The first legal contention advanced on behalf of the respondent-employees\n\nwas based on the principle of estoppel/promissory estoppel. It was the assertion of\n\nlearned counsel, that the respondent-employees had altered their position to their\n\ndetriment, on their having opted (or deemd to have opted) to be governed by ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’. In order to highlight the above assertion it was submitted, that the\n\nentire employer’s contribution towards provident fund (alongwith, the accumulated\ninterest thereon), was foregone by the respondent-employees. The said amount\n\nunquestionably belonged to the respondent-employees, and their right over the\n\nsame was protected under the\nProvident Fund Act\n. It was submitted, that the\n\naforesaid option was exercised by the respondent-employees, only when the offer to\n\nextend pensionary benefits, was voluntarily made to the employees by the State\n\nGovernment. It was contended, that the promise to pay pensionary benefits, which\n\nwas contained in the offer of the State Government, could not be unilaterally\n\nrevoked, under the principle of estoppel/promissory estoppel. It was submitted, that\n\nthe instant action of the State Government (taken by way of issuing the repeal\n\nnotification, dated 2.12.2004), would seriously impair the financial benefits which\n\nhad accrued to the respondent-employees, under ‘the 1999 Scheme’. It was\n\npointed out, that all that the respondent-employees had gained, by foregoing the\n\nemployer’s contribution (and the accrued interest, thereon), has been lost,\n\nconsequent upon the issuance of the impugned notification, dated 2.12.2004.\n\n58. We are of the considered view, that the principle of estoppel/promissory\n\nestoppel cannot be invoked at the hands of the respondent-employees, in the facts\n\nand circumstances of this case. It is not as if the rights which had accrued to the\n\nrespondent-employees under the Employees’ Provident Funds Scheme, 1995\n\n(under which the respondent-employees were governed, prior to their being\n\ngoverned by ‘the 1999 Scheme’) have in any manner been altered to their\n\ndisadvantage. All that was taken away, and given up by the respondent-employees\n\nby way of foregoing the employer’s contribution upto 31.3.1999 (including, the\n\naccrued interest thereon), by way of transfer to the corpus fund, was restored to the\n\nrespondent-employees. All the respondent-employees, who have been deprived of\ntheir pensionary claims by the repeal notification dated 2.12.2004, would be entitled\n\nto all the rights which had accrued to them, under the Employees’ Provident Funds\n\nScheme, 1995. It is therefore, not possible for us to accept, that the\n\nrespondent-employees can be stated to have been made to irretrievably alter their\n\nposition, to their detriment. Furthermore, all the corporate bodies (with which the\n\nrespondent-employees, are engaged) are independent juristic entities, as held in\n\nState of Assam v. Barak Upatyaka D.U. Karmachari Sanstha\n(supra). The mere\n\nfact, that the corporate bodies under reference, are fully controlled by the State\n\nGovernment, and the State Government is the ultimate authority to determine their\n\nconditions of service, under their Articles of Association, is inconsequential.\n\nUndoubtedly, the respondent-employees are not Government employees. The State\n\nGovernment, as a welfare measure, had ventured to honestly extend some\n\npost-retiral benefits to employees of such independent legal entities, on the\n\nmistaken belief, arising out of a miscalculation, that the same can be catered to, out\n\nof available resources. This measure was adopted by the State Government, not in\n\nits capacity as the employer of the respondent-employees, but as a welfare\n\nmeasure. When it became apparent, that the welfare measure extended by the\n\nState Government, could not be sustained as originally understood, the same was\n\nsought to be withdrawn.\n\nWe are of the view that the principle invoked on behalf of\n\nthe respondent-employees, cannot be applied in the facts of the present case,\n\nspecially, in view of the decision in M/s.\nBhagwati Vanaspati Traders v. Senior\n\nSuperintendent of Post Offices, Meerut\n, AIR 2015 SC 901, wherein this Court held\n\nas under:-\n\n“The first contention advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the\nappellant was based on the decision rendered by this Court in\nTata Iron &\nSteel Co. Ltd. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, (2001) 2 SCC 41, wherefrom learned\ncounsel invited our attention to the following observations:-\n\n“20. Estoppel by conduct in modern times stands elucidated with the\ndecisions of the English Courts in Pickard v. Sears, 1837 6 Ad. & El.\n469, and its gradual elaboration until placement of its true principles by\nthe Privy Council in the case of Sarat Chunder Dey v. Gopal Chunder\nLaha, (1891-92) 19 IA 203, whereas earlier Lord Esher in the case of\nSeton Laing Co. v. Lafone, 1887 19 Q.B.D. 68, evolved three basic\nelements of the doctrine of Estoppel to wit:\n\n“Firstly, where a man makes a fraudulent misrepresentation and\nanother man acts upon it to its true detriment: Secondly, another\nmay be where a man makes a false statement negligently though\nwithout fraud and another person acts upon it: And thirdly, there\nmay be circumstances under which, where a misrepresentation is\nmade without fraud and without negligence, there may be an\nEstoppel.”\nLord Shand, however, was pleased to add one further element to the\neffect that there may be statements made, which have induced other\nparty to do that from which otherwise he would have abstained and\nwhich cannot properly be characterized as misrepresentation. In this\ncontext, reference may be made to the decisions of the High Court of\nAustralia in the case of Craine v. Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co.\nLtd., 1920 28 C.L.R. 305. Dixon, J. in his judgment in Grundt v. The\nGreat Boulder Pty. Gold Mines Pty. Ltd., 1938 59 C.L.R. 641, stated\nthat:\n\n\"In measuring the detriment, or demonstrating its existence, one\ndoes not compare the position of the representee, before and\nafter acting upon the representation, upon the assumption that\nthe representation is to be regarded as true, the question of\nestoppel does not arise. It is only when the representor wished to\ndisavow the assumption contained in his representation that an\nestoppel arises, and the question of detriment is considered,\naccordingly, in the light of the position which the representee\nwould be in if the representor were allowed to disavow the truth of\nthe representation.\"\n\n(In this context see Spencer Bower and Turner: Estoppel by\nRepresentation, 3rd Ed.). Lord Denning also in the case of Central\nNewbury Car Auctions Ltd. v. Unity Finance Ltd., 1956 (3) All ER\n905, appears to have subscribed to the view of Lord Dixon, J. pertaining\nto the test of 'detriment' to the effect as to whether it appears unjust or\nunequitable that the representator should now be allowed to resile from\nhis representation, having regard to what the representee has done or\nrefrained from doing in reliance on the representation, in short, the party\nasserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment.\nSo long as the assumption is adhered to, the party who altered the\nsituation upon the faith of it cannot complain. His complaint is that when\nafterwards the other party makes a different state of affairs, the basis of\nan assertion of right against him then, if it is allowed, his own original\nchange of position will operate as a detriment, (vide Grundts: High\nCourt of Australia (supra)).\n\n21. Phipson on Evidence (Fourteenth Edn.) has the following to state\nas regards estoppels by conduct.\n\n“Estoppels by conduct, or, as they are still sometimes called,\nestoppels by matter in pais, were anciently acts of notoriety not\nless solemn and formal than the execution of a deed, such as\nlivery of seisin, entry, acceptance of an estate and the like, and\nwhether a party had or had not concurred in an act of this sort\nwas deemed a matter which there could be no difficulty in\nascertaining, and then the legal consequences followed (Lyon v.\nReed, (1844) 13 M & W 285 (at p. 309). The doctrine has,\nhowever, in modern times, been extended so as to embrace\npractically any act or statement by a party which it would be\nunconscionable to permit him to deny. The rule has been\nauthoritatively stated as follows: ‘Where one by his words or\nconduct willfully causes another to believe the existence of a\ncertain state of things and induces him to act on that belief so as\nto alter this own previous position, the former is concluded from\naverring against the latter a different state of things as existing at\nthe same time.’ (Pickard v. Sears (supra)). And whatever a man's\nreal intention may be, he is deemed to act willfully ‘if he so\nconducts himself that a reasonable man would take the\nrepresentation to be true and believe that it was meant that he\nshould act upon it.’ (Freeman v. Cooke, 1848 (2) Exch. 654: at p.\n\n663).\n\nWhere the conduct is negligent or consists wholly of\nomission, there must be a duty to the person misled (Mercantile\nBank v. Central Bank, 1938 AC 287 at p. 304, and National\nWestminster Bank v. Barclays Bank International, 1975 Q.B.\n\n654). This principle sits oddly with the rest of the law of estoppel,\nbut it appears to have been reaffirmed, at least by implication, by\nthe House of Lords comparatively recently (Moorgate Mercantile\nCo. Ltd. v. Twitchings, (1977) AC 890). The explanation is no\ndoubt that this aspect of estoppel is properly to be considered a\npart of the law relating to negligent representations, rather than\nestoppel properly so-called. If two people with the same source\nof information assert the same truth or agree to assert the same\nfalsehood at the same time, neither can be estopped as against\nthe other from asserting differently at another time (Square v.\nSquare, 1935 P. 120).”\n\n22. A bare perusal of the same would go to show that the issue of an\nestoppel by conduct can only be said to be available in the event of\nthere being a precise and unambiguous representation and on that\nscore a further question arises as to whether there was any unequivocal\nassurance prompting the assured to alter his position or status. The\ncontextual facts however, depict otherwise. Annexure 2 to the\napplication form for benefit of price protection contains an undertaking\nto the following effect:-\n\n“We hereby undertake to refund to EEPC Rs… the amount paid\nto us in full or part thereof against our application for price\nprotection. In terms of our application dated against exports\nmade during... In case any particular declaration/certificate\nfurnished by us against our above referred to claims are found to\nbe incorrect or any excess payment is determine to have been\nmade due to oversight/wrong calculation etc. at any time. We\nalso undertake to refund the amount within 10 days of receipt of\nthe notice asking for the refund, failing which the amount\nerroneously paid or paid in excess shall be recovered from or\nadjusted against any other claim for export benefits by EEPC or\nby the licensing authorities of CCI & C.”\nand it is on this score it may be noted that in the event of there being a\nspecific undertaking to refund for any amount erroneously paid or paid\nin excess (emphasis supplied), question of there being any estoppel in\nour view would not arise. In this context correspondence exchanged\nbetween the parties are rather significant. In particular letter dated\n30.11.1990 from the Assistant Development Commissioner for Iron &\nSteel and the reply thereto dated 8.3.1991 which unmistakably record\nthe factum of non-payment of JPC price.”\n\nIt is apparent from the factual position narrated above, that the original action of the\n\nState Government was bonafide, and for the welfare of the respondent-employees.\n\nThe State Government cannot be accused of having misrepresented to the\n\nrespondent-employees in any manner. The provisions of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, clearly\n\nbring out, that the pension scheme would be self-financing, and would be\n\nadministered from the corpus fund created out of the employer’s contribution to their\n\nCPF account (alongwith the accrued interest thereon). When the above\n\nfoundational basis for introducing the pension scheme, was found to be an incorrect\n\ndetermination/calculation, the same was withdrawn. In the above view of the matter,\n\nit would not be possible to infer, that the State Government, induced the\n\nrespondent-employees, to move to ‘the 1999 Scheme’. Accordingly, it would not be\n\npossible to apply the principle of estoppel/promissory estoppel, to the facts of the\n\npresent case.\n59. We are also of the view, that the principle of estoppel/promissory estoppel, is\n\nnot applicable in a situation, where the original position, which the individual enjoyed\n\nbefore altering his position (by opting, or deemingly opting - for being governed by\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’) can be restored. For the instant proposition, reference may be\n\nmade to the judgment in\nPratima Chowdhury v. Kalpana Mukherjee\n, (2014) 4 SCC\n\n196, wherein it was held as under:-\n\n“We shall, however, endeavour to deal with the principle of estoppel, so as to\nfigure whether, the rule contained in\nSection 115\nof the Indian Evidence Act\ncould have been invoked, in the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n\nSection 115\nof the Indian Evidence Act is being extracted hereinabove:-\n\n“115. Estoppel.- When one person has, by his declaration, act or\nomission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to\nbelieve a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he\nnor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding\nbetween himself and such person or his representative, to deny\nthe truth of that thing.\n\nIllustration\nA intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to\nA, and thereby induces B to buy and pay for it. The land afterwards\nbecomes the property of A, and A seeks to set aside the sale on the\nground that, at the time of the sale, he had no title. He must not be\nallowed to prove his want of title.”\nIt needs to be understood, that the rule of estoppel is a doctrine based on\nfairness. It postulates, the exclusion of, the truth of the matter. All, for the\nsake of fairness. A perusal of the above provision reveals four salient pre\nconditions before invoking the rule of estoppel. Firstly, one party should make\na factual representation to the other party. Secondly, the other party should\naccept and rely upon the aforesaid factual representation. Thirdly, having\nrelied on the aforesaid factual representation, the second party should alter\nhis position. Fourthly, the instant altering of position, should be such, that it\nwould be iniquitous to require him to revert back to the original position.\nTherefore, the doctrine of estoppel would apply only when, based on a\nrepresentation by the first party, the second party alters his position, in such\nmanner, that it would be unfair to restore the initial position.”\n\nSince there is no dispute, that the original position (the rights enjoyed by the\n\nrespondent-employees, under the Employees Provident Fund Scheme, 1995)\n\navailable before ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was given effect to, has actually been restored,\n\nwe are of the considered view, that the principle sought to be invoked on behalf of\nthe respondent-employees, cannot augur in a favourable determination for them,\n\nbecause it is not possible to conclude, that it would be unfair to restore them to their\n\noriginal position. In fact, in view of the financial incapacity to continue ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, the only fair action would be to restore the employees, to the Employees\n\nProvident Funds Scheme, 1995. This has actually been done by the State\n\nGovernment. It is therefore not possible in law, to apply the principle of\n\nestoppel/promissory estoppel, to the facts of the present controversy.\n\n60. Moving to the next contention. A serious dispute has been raised before us, in\n\nrespect of the financial viability of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. Insofar as the appellant-State\n\nis concerned, it was asserted on its behalf, that a high level committee, was\n\nconstituted by the Finance Department of the State Government, on 21.1.2003. The\n\nsaid committee comprised of managing directors, of the concerned public sector\n\nundertakings and corporations. The task of the high level committee was, to\n\nexamine the financial viability of ‘the 1999 Scheme’. The said committee submitted\n\na report dated 28.10.2003, returning a finding, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was not\n\nfinancially viable, and would not be self-sustaining. It is therefore, that a tentative\n\ndecision was taken by the State Government, to withdraw ‘the 1999 Scheme’.\n\n61. To determine the modalities for withdrawing ‘the 1999 Scheme’, on the basis\n\nof the above report, the matter was jointly examined by the Finance Department and\n\nthe Law Department of the State Government, wherein, in consonance with the\n\nadvice tendered by the Law Department it was decided, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’\n\nshould not be withdrawn retrospectively. Based on the advice of the Law\n\nDepartment, it was finally decided, that those who had commenced to draw\n\npensionary benefits under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, would not be deprived of the same.\nAnd that, ‘the 1999 Scheme’ should be withdrawn prospectively, for those whose\n\nright to receive pensionary benefits had not arisen, as they had not yet retired from\n\nservice. In the above view of the matter, it was contended on behalf of the State\n\nGovernment, that the action of the State Government, in issuing the repeal\n\nnotification dated 2.12.2004, was certainly not an arbitrary exercise of the power of\n\nadministrative review. It was submitted, that the same was based on two factors.\n\nFirstly, the financial unviability of the scheme. And secondly, those who had already\n\ncommenced to draw pensionary benefits under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, were not to be\n\naffected. It was therefore pointed out, that the classification made by the State\n\nGovernment was reasonable and justifiable in law, and it also had a nexus to the\n\nobject sought to be achieved.\n\n62. It is in the above scenario, that the legality and justiciability of ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, will have to be examined. The submission advanced at the behest of the\n\nrespondent-employees was, that it was not permissible for the State Government to\n\nadvance any such plea, because the State Government must be deemed to have\n\nexamined the financial viability of the scheme, before ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was given\n\neffect to. And that, it does not lie in the mouth of the State Government, after giving\n\neffect to ‘the 1999 Scheme’, to assert that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ was not financially\n\nviable. It was insisted, that even if data pertaining to the financial viability of the\n\nscheme, as was sought to be relied upon was correct, financial deficiencies if any,\n\ncould be catered to by the State Government, from the vast financial resources\n\navailable to it. And further, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’ in terms of the determination\n\nrendered by the High Court, even if permitted to be repealed, should not impact the\n\nrights of the respondent-employees, towards pensionary benefits.\n63. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the above contention. It is not\n\npossible for us to accept the instant contention, advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees. The calculations projected at the behest of the State\n\nGovernment, to demonstrate the financial unviability of the scheme, have not been\n\ndisputed. The same have been detailed in paragraph 10 above. The basis thereof,\n\nprojected by the high level committee, admittedly constitutes the rationale for issuing\n\nthe repeal notification dated 4.12.2004. We are of the view, that the consideration at\n\nthe hands of the State Government was conscious and pointed. And was supported\n\nby facts and figures. It is apparent, that out of 17 corporations/boards who were\n\ninvited to express their views on the issue, only 7 had actually done so. It is not the\n\ncase of the respondent-employees, that any one of those who had expressed their\n\nviews, contested the fact, that the pension scheme was not self-financing. Those\n\nwho expressed their views, affirmed that the pension scheme could be salvaged\n\nonly with Government support. Those who did not express their views, obviously\n\nhad no comments to offer. The position projected by the State Government,\n\ntherefore, cannot be considered to have been effectively rebutted. Certain facts and\n\nfigures, have indeed been projected, on behalf of the respondent-employees.\n\nThese have been recorded by us in paragraphs 39 and 40. Financial calculations\n\ncan not be made casually, on a generalized basis. In the absence of any\n\nauthenticity, and that too with reference to all the 20 corporate entities specified in\n\nSchedule I of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, the projections made on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees, cannot be accepted, as constituting a legitimate basis, for a\n\nfavourable legal determination. Since the respondent-employees have not been\n\nable to demonstrate, that the foundational basis for withdrawing ‘the 1999 Scheme’,\nwas not premised on any arbitrary consideration, or alternatively, was not founded\n\non any irrelevant consideration, it is not possible for us to accept the contention, that\n\nthe withdrawal of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, was not based on due consideration, or that, it\n\nwas irrational or arbitrary or unreasonable. We are also satisfied, that the action of\n\nthe State Government, in allowing those who had already started earning\n\npensionary benefits under ‘the 1999 Scheme’, was based on a legitimate\n\nclassification, acceptable in law. In the above view of the matter, the action of the\n\nState Government cannot be described as arbitrary, and as such, violative of\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India. We are also satisfied in concluding, that the\n\nunderstanding of the State Government (which had resulted in introducing ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’) on being found to be based on an incorrect calculation, with reference to\n\nthe viability of the corpus fund (to operate ‘the 1999 Scheme’), had to be\n\nadministratively reviewed. And that, the State Government’s determination in\n\nexercising its power of review, was well founded.\n\n64. It is also not possible for us to accept, that any Court has the jurisdiction to\n\nfasten a monetary liability on the State Government, as is the natural consequence,\n\nof the impugned order passed by the High Court, unless it emerges from the rights\n\nand liabilities canvassed in the lis itself. Budgetary allocations, are a matter of policy\n\ndecisions. The State Government while promoting ‘the 1999 Scheme’, felt that the\n\nsame would be self-financing. The State Government, never intended to allocate\n\nfinancial resources out of State funds, to run the pension scheme. The State\n\nGovernment, in the instant view of the matter, could not have been burdened with\n\nthe liability, which it never contemplated, in the first place. Moreover, it is the case of\n\nthe respondent-employees themselves, that a similar pension scheme, floated for\ncivil servants in the State of Himachal Pradesh, has also been withdrawn. The State\n\nGovernment has demonstrated its incapacity, to provide the required financial\n\nresources. We are therefore of the view, that the High Court should not (- as it could\n\nnot) have transferred the financial liability to run ‘the 1999 Scheme’, to the State\n\nGovernment. Similar suggestions made by the concerned corporate bodies, cannot\n\nconstitute a basis for fastening the residuary liability on the Government.\n\n65. The action of the State Government, in revoking ‘the 1999 Scheme’ vide\n\nnotification dated 2.12.2004, was also assailed as being discriminatory. And as\n\nsuch, violative of\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution of India. In this behalf, the\n\nsubmission advanced on behalf of the respondent-employees was, that the State\n\nGovernment extended similar benefits to Government employees under the Central\n\nCivil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972. The said pensionary benefits extended to\n\nGovernment servants, were also sought to be withdrawn. It was however pointed\n\nout, that while withdrawing the pensionary benefits from the Government\n\nemployees, the State Government had taken a decision to protect all existing\n\nemployees, who had entered into Government service, till the revocation of the\n\npension scheme. It was submitted, that the High Court had, by the impugned order,\n\nsimilarly protected only the existing employees, who were in service, as on the date\n\nof issuance of the repeal notification, dated 2.12.2004. It was contended, that the\n\nState Government’s action, in not treating the employees of corporate bodies,\n\ngoverned by ‘the 1999 Scheme’, similarly as it had treated employees in\n\nGovernment service, was clearly discriminatory. It was submitted, that two sets of\n\nemployees similarly situated, were treated differently. It was pointed out, that whilst\n\nprotection was extended to one set of employees, similar benefits were denied to\nthe other set of employees.\n\n66. We have given our thoughtful consideration of the plea of discrimination,\n\nadvanced at the behest of the respondent-employees. It is not possible for us to\n\naccept, that the employees of corporate bodies, can demand as of right, to be\n\nsimilarly treated as Government employees. Whilst it can be stated that\n\nGovernment employees of the State of Himachal Pradesh are civil servants, the\n\nsame is not true for employees of corporate bodies. Corporate bodies are\n\nindependent entities, and their employees cannot claim parity with employees of the\n\nState Government. The State Government has a master-servant relationship with\n\nthe civil servants of the State, whilst it has no such direct or indirect nexus with the\n\nemployees of corporate bodies. The State Government may legitimately choose to\n\nextend different rights in terms of pay-scales and retiral benefits to civil servants. It\n\nmay disagree, to extend the same benefits to employees of corporate bodies. The\n\nState Government would be well within its right, to deny similar benefits to\n\nemployees of corporate bodies, which are financially unviable, or if their activities\n\nhave resulted in financial losses. It is common knowledge, that when pay-scales are\n\nperiodically reviewed for civil servants, they do not automatically become applicable\n\nto employees of corporate bodies, which are wholly financed by the Government.\n\nAnd similarly, not even to employees of Government companies. Likewise, there\n\ncannot be parity with Government employees, in respect of allowances. So also, of\n\nretiral benefits. The claim for parity with Government employees is therefore wholly\n\nmisconceived. It is, therefore, not possible for us to accept the contention advanced\n\non behalf of the respondent-employees, that the action of the State Government\n\nwas discriminatory.\n67. Another reason for us to conclude, that the action of the State Government\n\nwas not discriminatory is, that despite having revoked ‘the 1999 Scheme’ through\n\nthe notification dated 2.12.2004, the State Government had permitted such of the\n\nGovernment owned corporations in the State of Himachal Pradesh, which were not\n\nsuffering any losses, to promote their own pension schemes, and to extend\n\npensionary benefits to their employees, on an individual basis, in the same/similar\n\nfashion as had been attempted by the State Government, through ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’. In the instant view of the matter also, we are of the opinion, that the\n\naction of the State Government cannot be assailed, on the ground of discrimination.\n\n68. We shall now consider, whether the State Government which had introduced\n\n‘the 1999 Scheme’, had the right to repeal the same. In answering the above issue,\n\nit needs to be consciously kept in mind, that the employees of corporate bodies, who\n\nwere extended the benefits of ‘the 1999 Scheme’, as already noticed above, were\n\nnot employees of the State Government. ‘The 1999 Scheme’ was, therefore, just a\n\nwelfare scheme introduced by the State Government, with the object of ameliorating\n\nthe financial condition of employees, who had rendered valuable service in State\n\nowned corporations. In order to logically appreciate the query posed, we may\n\nillustratively take into consideration a situation, wherein an organization similar to\n\nthe one in which the respondent-employees were engaged, suffered such financial\n\nlosses, as would make the sustenance of the organization itself, unviable. Can the\n\nemployees of such an organization, raise a claim in law, that the corporate body be\n\nnot wound up, despite its financial unworkability? Just because, the resultant effect\n\nwould be, that they would lose their jobs. The answer to the above query, has to be\n\nin the negative. The sustenance of the organization itself, is of paramount\nimportance. The claim of employees, who have been engaged by the organization,\n\nto run the activities of the organization, is of secondary importance. If an\n\norganization does not remain financially viable, the same cannot be required to\n\nremain functional, only for the reason that its employees, are not adversely\n\nimpacted. When and how a decision to wind up an organization is to be taken, is a\n\npolicy decision. The decision to wind up a corporation may be based on several\n\nfactors, including the nature of activities rendered by it. In a given organization,\n\nsometimes small losses may be sufficient to order its closure, as its activities may\n\nhave no vital bearing on the residents of the State. Where, an organization is raised\n\nto support activities on which a large number of people in the State are dependent,\n\nthe same may have to be sustained, despite the fact that there are substantial\n\nlosses. The situations are unlimited. Each situation has to be regulated\n\nadministratively, in terms of the policy of the State Government. Whether a\n\ncorporate body can no longer be sustained, because its activities are no longer\n\nworkable, practicable, useable, or effective, either for the State itself, or for the\n\nwelfare of the residents of the State, is for the State Government to decide.\n\nSimilarly, when and how much, is to be paid as wages (or allowances) to employees\n\nof an organization, is also a policy decision. So also, post-retiral benefits. All these\n\nissues fall in the realm of executive determination. No Court has any role therein.\n\nFor the reasons recorded hereinabove, in our considered view, the conditions of\n\nservice including wages, allowances and post-retiral benefits of employees of\n\ncorporate bodies, will necessarily have to be determined administratively, on the\n\nbasis of relevant factors. Financial viability, is an important factor, in such\n\nconsideration. In the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is not possible\nfor us to accept, the contention advanced on behalf of the respondent-employees,\n\nthat the State Government should provide financial support for sustaining ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, at least for such of the employees, who were engaged on or before the\n\ndate of issuance of the repeal notification (- 4.12.2004). We would like to conclude\n\nthe instant submission by recording, that the respondent-employees have not been\n\nable to make out a case, that the notification dated 2.12.2004, repealing ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, was in any manner, capricious, arbitrary, illegal or uninformed, and as\n\nsuch, we would further conclude, that the respondent-employees cannot be\n\nconsidered as being entitled, to any relief, through judicial process.\n\n69. Having recorded our aforesaid conclusion, it is not necessary for us to\n\nexamine the submissions advanced at the hands of the respondent-employees, that\n\nthe action of the State Government, in issuing the repeal notification dated\n\n2.12.2004, would violate\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. All the same, since\n\nthe contention was raised, we consider it just and appropriate, to examine and deal\n\nwith the same. The contention advanced on behalf of the respondent-employees\n\nwas, that the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, do not extend to\n\nmerely, providing for survival or animal existence.\nArticle 21\n, it was pointed out, has\n\nbeen interpreted by this Court, as extending the right to life and liberty - as the right\n\nto live, with human dignity. It was submitted, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’, which allowed\n\nbetter post-retiral benefits to the respondent-employees, was an extension of such a\n\nbenefit. ‘The 1999 Scheme’, it was submitted, would have resulted in ameliorating\n\nthe conditions of the respondent-employees, after their retirement. The submission\n\nadvanced on behalf of the respondent-employees is seemingly attractive, but is not\n\nacceptable as a proposition of law. A welfare scheme, may or may not aim at\nproviding, the very basic rights to sustain human dignity. In situations where a\n\nscheme targets to alleviate basic human rights, the same may possibly constitute an\n\nirreversible position, as withdrawal of the same, would violate\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution. Not so, otherwise. Herein, the Employees’ Provident Funds Scheme,\n\n1995, sponsored under the\nProvident Fund Act\n, is in place. The same was sought\n\nto be replaced, by ‘the 1999 Scheme’. ‘The 1999 Scheme’ was an effort at the\n\nbehest of the State Government, to provide still better retiral benefits. ‘The 1999\n\nScheme’ was not a measure, aimed at providing basic human rights. Therefore, ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’ can not be treated as irreversible. The same would not violate\nArticle\nof the Constitution, on its being withdrawn. It is not in dispute, that after the\n\nrepeal notification dated 2.12.2004, the erstwhile Employees’ Provident Funds\n\nScheme, 1995, has been restored to such of the employees, who were impacted by\n\nthe said repeal notification. We are of the view, that the repealing of ‘the 1999\n\nScheme’, in the facts and circumstances of this case, cannot be deemed to have in\n\nany manner, violated the right of the respondent-employees, under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n70. It is also not possible to accept, the contention advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees, based on\nArticle 300A\nof the Constitution of India. We have\n\ndeliberated hereinabove, the nature of the right created by ‘the 1999 Scheme’. We\n\nhave examined all the legal submissions advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees. We have arrived at the conclusion, that action of the State\n\nGovernment, was well within its authority. We have also held the same to be based\n\non due consideration. We have therefore, rejected the assertion made on behalf of\n\nthe respondent-employees, that the impugned notification dated 2.12.2004, was\nunconstitutional, irrational, arbitrary or unreasonable. It is accordingly not possible\n\nfor us to accept, the challenge raised by the respondent-employees, that they had\n\nbeen deprived of their right to pensionary benefits, without the authority in law. We\n\nare therefore of the view, that the claim raised on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees, by placing reliance on\nArticle 300A\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia, is misconceived.\n\n71. Our determination, with reference to all the issues canvassed above, would\n\nalso answer the question left open in paragraph 52 above. Namely, whether or not\n\nthe contingent right, as was vested in the respondent-employees, was binding or\n\nirrevocable. We may now sum up the position determined by us, in the foregoing\n\nparagraphs. It is no doubt true that we have concluded, that ‘the 1999 Scheme’,\n\ncreated a contingent right in the respondent-employees. The\n\nrespondent-employees comprise of all those employees of corporate bodies, who\n\nhad opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’, immediately on its having been introduced; all\n\nthose, who were deemed to have opted for ‘the 1999 Scheme’ by not having\n\nexercised any option; and all those who were appointed after the introduction of ‘the\n\n1999 Scheme’. The first issue that arises is, whether any express right or obligation\n\nexisted, between the respondent-employees and the State Government. One can\n\nunderstand, such a claim arising out of an obligation between an employer and his\n\nemployees, where there is a quid pro quo – a trade off based on a relationship (as\n\nbetween, an employer and employee). We have however concluded, that there was\n\nno such relationship between the State Government, and the\n\nrespondent-employees. All the corporate bodies in which the\n\nrespondent-employees were/are engaged, are independent juristic entities. It is\ntherefore apparent, that the claim raised by the respondent-employees, is not based\n\non any right or obligation between the parties. We have also examined the\n\nsubmissions advanced by learned counsel premised on various constitutional\n\nprovisions (-\nArticles 14\n, 16\n, 21\nand\n300A\nof the Constitution of India), but have\n\nfound, that no right can be stated to have been violated, thereunder. We have also\n\nexamined the other legal submissions, advanced on behalf of the\n\nrespondent-employees, and have found the same, as unjustified. The issue\n\nwhether administrative review was permissible, after ‘the 1999 Scheme’ had\n\nbecome operational, has been answered in the affirmative. And finally, we have\n\nconcluded, that the exercise of such power, while issuing the repeal notification, was\n\nbased on due consideration. We therefore hereby uphold, the legality and\n\nconstitutionality of the notification dated 2.12.2004.\n\n72.
