No.17 of 1991. After having purchased, on 26.07.2013,\n\n the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu sold the property measuring an extent of 1.36\n\n 2 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n Acres of land comprised in S.No.679/8B; 1.99 Acres of land comprised in\n\n S.No.679/1 and 0.42 cents of land comprised in S.No.679/4 situated at\n\n Sunjalnatham village to one D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy\n\n vide Doc.No.361 of 2013. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu, the\n\n original owner executed a rectification deed dated 31.08.2015 vide Doc.\n\n No.3035/2015 in favour of the said D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and\n\n P.K.Duraisamy to rectify the mistake in respect of the survey number for 1.36\n\n acres of land. According to the rectification deed, instead of S.NO.679/8A, it\n\n was wrongly typed out as S.No.679/8B.\n\n 2.2 Thereafter, one I.Veerasamy, a practising Advocate as plaintiff, filed\n\n a suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 against his own brother-A.Madhu, the\n\n 2nd respondent herein, and his other family members for partition and also for a\n\n declaration, declaring the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by the\n\n 2nd respondent in favour of D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy as\n\n null and void and for permanent injunction which suit was taken on file as O.S.\n\n No. 21 of 2020.\n\n 2.3 In the said suit, an interim application was filed by Advocate Mr. I.\n\n Veerasamy, which was numbered as I.A. No. 131 of 2021, seeking an order of\n\n interim injunction. The above-said application was heard and dismissed by the\n\n District Munsif by order dated 29.10.2021 on merits.

The learned District Munsif,\n\n acceding to the request of the plaintiff-Advocate-I.Veerasamy, dismissed the\n\n suit in O.S.No.21 of 2020 as not pressed.\n\n 2.4 While so, D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy, who\n\n originally purchased the properties described in the suit schedule measuring an\n\n extent of 1.30 acres of land in S.No.679/8A; 1.99 Acres of land in S.No.679/1\n\n and 42 cents of land in S.No.679/4 after having retained 0.06 cents in\n\n S.No.679/8A by way of sale deed dated 13.12.2021 vide Doc.No.5687 of 2021\n\n from the 2nd respondent-A.Madhu, in turn, sold the same on 13.12.2021 to the\n\n revision petitioners by virtue of a registered sale deed bearing Document No.\n\n 5687 of 2021. Pursuant to the said purchase, the revenue records were\n\n mutated in their name.\n\n 2.5 When the matter stood thus, Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein\n\n engaged Mr. I. Veerasamy, Advocate, to file a suit for specific performance\n\n against the 2nd respondent in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned\n\n District Munsif, Pennagaram, based on a bogus and fraudulent agreement of\n\n 4 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n sale said to have been executed on 05.05.2011. The said suit was filed on\n\n 09.03.2023 by Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein against the 2nd respondent-\n\n A.Madhu (who was arrayed as 1st defendant in the suit) and 4 others. The 2nd\n\n respondent - A.Madhu who was the 1st defendant in the suit had conveniently\n\n remained ex parte in the said suit, and let the suit decreed ex parte on\n\n 29.09.2023. Thereafter, the 1st respondent—Ganesan filed an execution\n\n petition, and pursuant to the orders passed therein, a sale deed was executed in\n\n his favour through the executing court, based on the ex parte decree obtained in\n\n O.S. No. 16 of 2023.\n\n 2.6 According to the revision petitioners, the decree obtained in\n\n O.S.NO.16 of 2023 was nothing but an outcome of fraud and collusion between\n\n the 1strespondent’s Advocate - I.Veerasamy who was plaintiff in O.S.No.21 of\n\n 2020 on the file of the learned District Munsif, Pennagaram and incidentally, he\n\n was the Advocate who represented the plaintiff-Ganesan in the in the suit in\n\n O.S.No.16 of 2023, the 1st respondent herein.\n\n 2.7 The vendors of the revision petitioners lawfully purchased the\n\n property on 26.07.2013 under a registered sale deed, which is duly recorded in\n\n the encumbrance register maintained by the Registration Department.\n\n 2.8 The suit for specific performance was filed at the instance of Mr. I.\n\n 5 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n Veerasamy, Advocate, who is the mastermind behind the creation of the alleged\n\n sale agreement dated 05.05.2011. The 1st respondent was only a name lender.\n\n Hence, the decree dated 29.09.2023 passed in O.S. No.16 of 2023 on the file of\n\n the learned District Munsif, Pennagaram is nothing but a product of fraud and is\n\n a nullity in the eyes of law. As the decree was obtained by practising fraud upon\n\n the Court, it is rendered void ab initio and can be challenged under \nArticle 227\n\n of the Constitution of India. The learned counsel for the revision petitioners\n\n submitted that it is highly improbable for a person, who had allegedly entered\n\n into an agreement for sale in the year 2011, to remain silent for more than\n\n twelve years and then abruptly file a suit for specific performance in the year\n\n 2023. Such prolonged and unexplained inaction, according to the learned\n\n counsel, raises grave doubts about the authenticity of the alleged agreement. It\n\n is further contended that the said agreement appears to have been fabricated\n\n solely with the intention of defeating and nullifying the valid sale deed already\n\n executed by A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent herein who is the brother of\n\n Advocate – I.Veerasamy in favour of D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and\n\n P.K.Duraisamy.\n\n 3. This court has heard Mr.N.Manokaran, learned counsel for the revision\n\n petitioners, Mr.S.Mukunth, learned senior counsel on behalf of\n\n 6 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n Mr.R.Vasudevan, counsel on record for the 1st respondent and\n\n Mr.T.Arunkumar, learned Additional Government Pleader for the 2nd\n\n respondent.\n\n 4.1 The learned counsel for the revision petitioners summarised the\n\n background of the facts leading to the filing of the revisionpetition in detail\n\n which read as follows:\n\n (i) Earlier, one Advocate, I. Veerasamy, a practising Advocate,\n\n instituted a suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 against his brother, the 2nd respondent,\n\n A. Madhu (2nd defendant), mother Kunjammal and other family members,\n\n besides the District Collector, Pennagaram, and a few other officials of the\n\n Registration, Revenue, and Survey Departments, a decree and judgement for\n\n partition of the family properties; a declaration declaring that the sale deed\n\n executed in favour of defendants 7 and 8 as null and void; a permanent\n\n injunction and for mesne profits.\n\n (ii) Along with the suit, Advocate I. Veerasamy, who was the\n\n plaintiff in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, also filed an application for interim injunction.\n\n However, the trial court, by a reasoned order dated 29.10.2021 in I.A. No. 131\n\n of 2021, dismissed the said application on merits. Subsequently, the plaintiff—\n\n Advocate I. Veerasamy, chose to withdraw the entire suit.\n\n (iii) Thereafter, the very same Advocate filed another suit, which\n\n 7 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n was taken on file as O.S. No. 16 of 2023, this time in the name of the 1st\n\n respondent herein – Ganesan, seeking specific performance of an agreement\n\n allegedly dated 05.05.2011.\n\n (iv) The very nature of the non-judicial stamp paper used for\n\n engrossment of the alleged agreement of sale would sufficiently indicate that it\n\n was created solely for the purpose of fabricating an agreement of sale. The\n\n appropriate stamp duty for engrossing an agreement of sale is twenty rupees, as\n\n prescribed under \nArticle 5(j)\n of the \nSchedule to the Indian Stamp Act\n, as\n\n amended by the Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 2001. However, in the present case, the\n\n alleged agreement has been engrossed on a non-judicial stamp paper of only ten\n\n rupees, which is insufficient and improper for such a document. This\n\n discrepancy, according to the learned counsel, categorically establish that the\n\n agreement was not executed contemporaneously in 2011 as claimed, but was\n\n instead created later to suit the convenience of the first respondent.\n\n (v) The very same Advocate — Mr. I. Veerasamy — who had\n\n earlier instituted a comprehensive suit seeking a judgment and decree for\n\n partition of the suit properties into six equal shares, allotment of one such share\n\n to the plaintiff, and for separate possession, had also sought a declaration that\n\n the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by the 2nd defendant in favour of\n\n 8 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n defendants 7, 8, and 9 was fraudulent, dishonest, null and void. In addition, he\n\n prayed for a permanent injunction restraining defendants 7 and 8 from entering\n\n upon or encroaching upon the suit properties and from measuring the same, as\n\n well as an enquiry into mesne profits. It is this very same Advocate who has\n\n now filed the present suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, seeking specific performance\n\n on the basis of an alleged agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, thereby giving\n\n rise to serious concerns regarding the bona fides and consistency of the legal\n\n claims advanced. However, in doing so, the said Advocate has deliberately\n\n failed to implead the purchasers of the property,who are necessary parties to the\n\n suit. Instead, Mr. I. Periyasamy, who instituted the suit on behalf of Ganesan,\n\n the 1st respondent herein, chose to implead his own brother, Mr. A. Madhu, and\n\n four public officials including those from the Registration Department and the\n\n District Collector, Dharmapuri, without impleading the actual purchasers, who\n\n are just and necessary parties to the suit.\n\n (vi) Such selective impleadment, omitting necessary parties without\n\n whom the matter could not have been adjudicated effectively, enabled the 1st\n\n respondent to obtain an ex parte decree. This sequence of events, coupled with\n\n the procedural omissions, would clearly establish that the decree was obtained\n\n by playing fraud upon the Court.\n\n 9 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n (vii) Advocate I. Veerasamy, as plaintiff, filed a suit in the year 2020,\n\n which was taken on file as O.S. No. 21 of 2020 on the file of the learned\n\n District Munsif, Pennagaram, seeking partition and other reliefs. In that suit, he\n\n was fully aware of the earlier sale transaction and, in fact, specifically sought a\n\n declaration that the sale deed dated 26.07.2013, executed by the 2nd respondent\n\n herein (who was arrayed as the 1st defendant in that suit) in favour of D.\n\n Madhaiyan and two others, was fraudulent, dishonest, and null and void.\n\n (viii) However, subsequently, the same Advocate filed another suit in the\n\n name of Ganesan, the 1st respondent herein, based on an alleged agreement of\n\n sale dated 05.11.2011, seeking specific performance, while purportedly\n\n suppressing all the previous transactions concerning the sale of the property by\n\n the 2nd respondent to D. Madhaiyan and others.\n\n (ix) Such deliberate concealment of material facts and earlier proceedings\n\n would, by itself, be sufficient to constitute fraud played upon the Court.\n\n 4.2 In essence, the learned counsel for the revision petitioners submitted\n\n that\n\n (i) The suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was a fraudulent and collusive\n\n action filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy in the name of the 1st respondent –\n\n Ganesan, after having withdrawn an earlier suit (O.S. No. 21 of 2020) in which\n\n 10 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n he himself had challenged the same sale deed dated 26.07.2013. In the present\n\n suit, the said Advocate deliberately suppressed the earlier transactions and\n\n failed to implead the bona fide purchasers of the property, despite being fully\n\n aware of their interest. The agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, alleged in\n\n support of the suit, was not only suspiciously delayed in enforcement but also\n\n improperly stamped, indicating fabrication. The suit was thus engineered to\n\n secure an ex parte decree by deceit.\n\n (ii) Such deliberate concealment and procedural manipulation\n\n amount to fraud on the Court, warranting exercise of powers under \nArticle 227\n\n of the Constitution to set aside the decree and the sale deed executed pursuant\n\n to it as null and void.\n\n 4.3 The learned counsel for the revision petitioners in support of his\n\n above contentions placed reliance upon the following judgements:\n\n \n1. \nS.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath\n, (1994) 1\n SCC 1;\n\n \n2. \nSatluj Jal Vidyut Nigam v. Raj Kumar Rajinder\n Singh\n, (2019) 14 SCC 449;\n\n 3. K.P.Natarajan and another v. Muthuammal and\n others, (2024) 6 CTC 819\n\n 4. S.Baskar v. S.Ranjithkumar and others (2021) 1\n CTC 539\n\n 11 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n 5. Shanthimalai Trust v. Arunachala Education &\n Environmental (2021) 1 CTC 539; and\n\n 6. Ayyasamy v. Shanmugam (2024) 6 MLJ 164\n\n 5.1 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent opposing\n\n the revision, submitted that the decree obtained in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 is\n\n lawful, valid, and based on a binding agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011. the\n\n ex parte decree was passed after service of summons, and no challenge was\n\n raised at the relevant time. The decree was followed by execution proceedings,\n\n culminating in the execution of a sale deed through the court, thereby\n\n transferring valid title to the 1st respondent.\n\n 5.2 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent further contended that the\n\n 2nd respondent – A. Madhu, as the original owner of the property, had entered\n\n into a valid agreement for sale with the 1st respondent – Ganesan, and that the\n\n entire sale consideration was paid at the time of the agreement. Due to delay on\n\n the part of the vendor in executing the sale deed, the 1st respondent was\n\n compelled to file the suit for specific performance.\n\n 5.3 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent furthermore contended that\n\n the failure to implead subsequent purchasers does not render the decree void, as\n\n 12 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n they were neither necessary nor proper parties to a suit between the contracting\n\n parties, especially when the purchasers had notice of the prior agreement.\n\n Earlier suit (O.S. No. 21 of 2020) filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy was entirely\n\n independent and unrelated to the agreement in question and was withdrawn\n\n voluntarily. The present suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was based on a legally\n\n enforceable agreement and pursued in accordance with law. The ex parte nature\n\n of the proceedings, by itself, does not constitute fraud, and that the decree was\n\n passed following the normal legal process. Merely because Advocate I.\n\n Veerasamy, who instituted the suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on behalf of the 1st\n\n respondent—Ganesan, and who was himself the plaintiff in the earlier suit in\n\n O.S. No. 21 of 2020, happens to be a close relative of Ganesan, such a\n\n relationship alone cannot form the basis to attribute fraud.\n\n 5.4 According to the learned counsel for the 1st respondent, the revision\n\n petitioners cannot invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court\n\n under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India to challenge the validity of a\n\n decree that was legally passed, even if it was an ex parte decree. If the revision\n\n petitioners were truly aggrieved by such decree, the proper course of action\n\n would have been to file an appeal or an application to set aside the ex parte\n\n decree, as provided under \nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n or to file a separate suit\n\n 13 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n for declaration under \nSection 34\n of the Specific Relief Act or otherwise to\n\n establish that the decree is not binding on them due to fraud, collusion, or\n\n suppression.\n\n 5.5 The learned counsel for the 1st respondent lastly contended that\n\n allegations of fraud, collusion, or suppression of material facts must be\n\n specifically pleaded and proved by evidence. Such serious allegations cannot be\n\n raised casually or for the first time in a revision petition. The revision\n\n petitioners, having failed to challenge the proceedings at the appropriate time,\n\n cannot now, at this belated stage, seek to unsettle a concluded judicial\n\n proceeding by making unsubstantiated claims. Therefore, the learned counsel\n\n prayed that the revision petition be dismissed.\n\n 6.1 The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent while adopting the\n\n arguments advanced by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the 1st\n\n respondent would additionally contend that the powers of the High Court under\n\n \nArticle 227\n being supervisory, the same has to be exercised sparingly in cases\n\n where errors are apparent on the face of record, occasioning grave injustice by\n\n the court assuming jurisdiction which it does not have, failing to exercise\n\n jurisdiction which it does have, or exercising its jurisdiction in a perverse\n\n 14 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n manner. Hence, he would contend that essence of the power under \nArticle 227\n,\n\n being supervisory, it cannot be invoked to usurp the original jurisdiction of the\n\n court which it seeks to supervise.\n\n 6.2 In support of his above contention, Mr.S.Mukunth, learned senior\n\n counsel would place much reliance on the very recent judgement of the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court in S.L.P.(C) No.21466 of 2024 dated 29.04.2025 (K.Valarmathi\n\n and others v. Kumaresan).\n\n 7. In the light of the rival submissions, the point that arises for\n\n consideration in this revision petition is:\n\n Whether the Court, while exercising its power\n\n under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India, can set\n\n aside an ex parte decree on the ground of fraud and abuse\n\n of process of law?\n\n 8. It is apposite to refer to the settled legal principles on the subject.\n\n 9. \nIn \nS.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu v. Jagannath\n, (1994) 1 SCC 1, the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical\n\n 15 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n or temporal. The 1st paragraph of the judgement reads as follows:\n\n “Fraud avoids all judicial acts, ecclesiastical or\n temporal” observed Chief Justice Edward Coke of England\n about three centuries ago. It is the settled proposition of law\n that a judgment or decree obtained by playing fraud on the\n court is a nullity and non est in the eyes of law. Such a\n judgment/decree by the first court or by the highest court has\n to be treated as a nullity by every court, whether superior or\n inferior. It can be challenged in any court even in collateral\n proceedings.”\n\n 10. \nIn \nSatluj Jal Vidyut Nigam v. Raj Kumar Rajinder Singh\n, (2019)\n\n 14 SCC 449, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\n “68. Fraud vitiates every solemn proceeding and no right\n can be claimed by a fraudster on the ground of\n technicalities. On behalf of the appellants, reliance has\n been placed on the definition of “fraud” as defined\n in Black's Law Dictionary, which is as under:\n\n “Fraud : (1) A knowing misrepresentation of the\n truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to\n act to his or her detriment. Fraud is usually a tort, but in\n some cases (esp. when the conduct is wilful) it may be a\n crime. … (2) A misrepresentation made recklessly without\n belief in its truth to induce another person to act. (3) A tort\n arising from a knowing misrepresentation, concealment of\n material fact, or reckless misrepresentation made to induce\n\n 16 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n another to act to his or her detriment. (4) Unconscionable\n dealing; esp., in contract law, the unconscientious use of\n the power arising out of the parties' relative positions and\n resulting in an unconscionable bargain.”\n\n 69.Halsbury's Laws of England has defined “fraud”\n as follows:\n\n “Whenever a person makes a false statement which he\n does not actually and honestly believe to be true, for\n purpose of civil liability, the statement is as fraudulent as\n if he had stated that which he did know to be true, or know\n or believed to be false. Proof of absence of actual and\n honest belief is all that is necessary to satisfy the\n requirement of the law, whether the representation has\n been made recklessly or deliberately, indifference or\n recklessness on the part of the representor as to the truth\n or falsity of the representation affords merely an instance\n of absence of such a belief.”\n\n 70. In Kerr on the Law of Fraud and Mistake,\n “fraud” has been defined thus:\n\n “It is not easy to give a definition of what\n constitutes fraud in the extensive significance in which\n that term is understood by Civil Courts of Justice. The\n courts have always avoided hampering themselves by\n defining or laying down as a general proposition what\n shall be held to constitute fraud. Fraud is infinite in\n variety… Courts have always declined to define it, …\n reserving to themselves the liberty to deal with it under\n whatever form it may present itself. Fraud … may be said\n to include property (sic properly) all acts, omissions, and\n concealments which involve a breach of legal or equitable\n duty, trust or confidence, justly reposed, and are injurious\n to another, or by which an undue or unconscientious\n\n 17 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n advantage is taken of another. All surprise, trick, cunning,\n dissembling and other unfair way that is used to cheat\n anyone is considered as fraud.

Savitri Devi [Ram Chandra\n Singh\n v. Savitri Devi, (2003) 8 SCC 319] , it was observed\n that fraud vitiates every solemn act. Fraud and justice\n never dwell together and it cannot be perpetuated or saved\n by the application of any equitable doctrine including res\n judicata. This Court observed as under : (SCC pp. 327-29,\n paras 15-18, 23 & 25)\n\n “15. Commission of fraud on court and suppression of\n material facts are the core issues involved in these\n matters.

Para 21\n\n of the judgement reads as follows:\n\n “21. The contention that in a revision arising out of the\n dismissal of a petition under \nSection 5\n of the Limitation\n Act, 1963, the High Court cannot set aside the ex parte\n decree itself, by invoking the power under \nArticle 227\n,\n does not appeal to us.

Following the settled legal position, this Court, in S. Baskar v. S.\n\n Ranjithkumar and others, MANU/TN/6545/2024 (C.R.P. No. 4050 of 2024\n\n dated 02.12.2024), has held as follows:\n\n “12. This Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under\n \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India, is exercising\n power of superintendence over all the Courts and\n tribunals throughout the State. This Court cannot turn a\n blind eye when its attention is drawn to an ex-facie illegal\n judgment. This Court has to necessarily interfere with the\n same, failing which, there will be failure of justice and it\n will amount to perpetuating illegality.”\n\n 13. In Shanthimalai Trust v.

In Ayyasamy v. Shanmugam, MANU/TN/5582/2023\n\n (C.R.P.No.2672 of 2019 dated 19.09.2023), this court has held that the High\n\n Court under \nArticle 227\n has the jurisdiction to set aside a decree while dealing\n\n with a revision under \nSection 5\n of the Limitation Act.\n\n 15. All the above precedents make it abundantly clear that a decree\n\n obtained by playing fraud upon the Court or by abuse of the process of law is a\n\n nullity in the eyes of law. In such cases, the supervisory jurisdiction of the High\n\n Court under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution can rightly be invoked to set aside\n\n such an illegal and void decree, in order to uphold the sanctity of the judicial\n\n process and prevent miscarriage of justice.\n\n 16. In K. Valarmathi and others v. Kumaresan [S.L.P. (C) No. 21466 of\n\n 2024, dated 29.04.2025], upon which the learned senior counsel for the 1st\n\n respondent placed much reliance, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that a\n\n decree cannot be set aside in the exercise of jurisdiction under \nArticle 227\n of\n\n 24 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n the Constitution of India. In the said judgement, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\n emphasized that \nArticle 227\n confers supervisory jurisdiction, not appellate or\n\n revisional jurisdiction, and cannot be invoked to substitute statutory remedies or\n\n to set aside a decree passed by a competent civil court in the exercise of its\n\n original jurisdiction.\n\n 17. On a careful perusal of the recent judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court in K. Valarmathi and Others v. Kumaresan (cited supra), this Court\n\n finds that none of the earlier judgements rendered by the Hon’ble Supreme\n\n Court were brought to the notice of the Court. In particular, the earlier binding\n\n precedent of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Natarajan v. Muthuammal, (2021)\n\n 15 SCC 817, wherein it was categorically held that the powers of the High\n\n Court under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India are in addition to, and\n\n wider than, the power under \nSection 115\n of the Code of Civil Procedure, and\n\n that such power can be exercised even to set aside a decree in exceptional\n\n circumstances, was not considered.\n\n 18. In the case of Natarajan v. Muthuammal (supra), the Hon’ble\n\n Supreme Court examined and relied upon several earlier decisions and\n\n reaffirmed the settled legal position regarding the scope of \nArticle 227.\n\n Accordingly, this Court is inclined to consider the facts of the present case\n\n 25 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n bearing in mind the law laid down in Natarajan's case and the binding\n\n precedents in few other cases which have consistently interpreted the scope and\n\n extent of supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under \nArticle 227\n of the\n\n Constitution.\n\n 19. Ordinarily, a challenge to a decree on the ground that it was obtained\n\n by fraud must be raised by way of an appeal or appropriate proceedings wherein\n\n the alleged fraud must be specifically pleaded and established by evidence.\n\n Mere allegations of fraud and collusion are not sufficient and there must be\n\n concrete facts to substantiate the allegations of fraud and collusion. However, in\n\n cases where the fraud is evident on the face of the judgment and decree, or\n\n discernible from the conduct of the parties, it may not be necessary to await a\n\n full-fledged trial for determination. In such exceptional circumstances, where\n\n the decree itself is a product of fraud and amounts to an abuse of the process of\n\n court, the High Court, in exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction under \nArticle\n\n 227\n of the Constitution of India, is empowered to intervene and set aside such\n\n decree. The jurisdiction of the High Court under \nArticle 227\n is not ousted in\n\n cases where the decree is a nullity in law owing to fraud perpetrated upon the\n\n court itself.\n\n 26 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n 20. Let this Court now advert to the facts of the present case, wherein the\n\n decree dated 29.09.2023 is sought to be assailed, in the light of the settled legal\n\n position discussed above.\n\n 21. On a careful perusal of the judgment and decree dated 29.09.2023\n\n made in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned District Munsif,\n\n Pennagaram, it is seen that the 1st respondent filed the suit on the basis of an\n\n unregistered agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011, allegedly entered into\n\n between the 1st respondent (purchaser) and the 2nd respondent (vendor). It is\n\n pertinent to note that although the agreement is dated 05.05.2011, the suit came\n\n to be filed only in the year 2023.\n\n 22. The pleadings in the plaint reveal that no steps were taken by the\n\n plaintiff from the date of the alleged agreement, despite claiming that the entire\n\n sale consideration of Rs. 80,000/- for the purchase of 3.77 acres was paid in full\n\n on the date of execution of agreement of sale itself. It is pleaded in the plaint\n\n that the 1st respondent herein issued a legal notice to his vendor, the 2nd\n\n respondent herein only on 01.03.2023, nearly twelve years later, calling upon\n\n him to appear before the Sub-Registrar for execution of the sale deed.\n\n 23. A photocopy of the so-called agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011 has\n\n been placed before this Court for perusal. On a careful examination of the same,\n\n it is seen that the said agreement was typed on a non-judicial stamp paper of\n\n 27 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n Rs.10/-, which appears to have been purchased in the name of the 1st\n\n respondent – Ganesan.\n\n 24. It is relevant to place on record that, as per \nArticle 5(j)\n of \nSchedule-I\n\n to the Indian Stamp Act, 1899\n, as amended by the Tamil Nadu Act 9 of 2001,\n\n the stamp duty for an agreement for sale was prescribed as Rs. 20/-, with effect\n\n from 11.07.2002. Therefore, the fact that the alleged agreement of sale dated\n\n 05.05.2011 was executed on a non-judicial stamp paper of only Rs. 10/-, instead\n\n of the statutorily required Rs. 20/-, raises a serious doubt about the genuineness\n\n and authenticity of the document.\n\n 25. Be that as it may, though the agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011\n\n states that the entire sale consideration of Rs. 80,000/- for the sale of 3.77 acres\n\n of land had been paid in full, there is no recital in the agreement regarding\n\n delivery of possession of the subject properties to the purchaser. Furthermore,\n\n the agreement does not stipulate any specific time frame within which the sale\n\n transaction was to be completed by execution and registration of the sale deed.\n\n 26. This Court is of the view that the absence of a specific time limit\n\n prescribed in the agreement of sale clearly indicates that such omission was\n\n deliberate, with the apparent intention of bringing the suit within the period of\n\n 28 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n limitation as contemplated under Part II of \nArticle 54\n of the \nLimitation Act,\n\n 1963\n.\n\n 27. It is relevant to note that the conduct of a person who claims to have\n\n parted with the entire sale consideration, yet remains silent for more than\n\n twelve years without initiating any action, is wholly inconsistent with the\n\n conduct expected of a prudent person. The prolonged inaction on the part of the\n\n 1st respondent, including the failure to issue even a legal notice during this\n\n entire period demanding execution of the sale deed, assumes considerable\n\n significance when viewed in the context of the other attending circumstances of\n\n the case. Such unexplained delay raises serious doubts about the bona fides of\n\n the alleged agreement and the claim arising therefrom.\n\n 28. It is also relevant to note that the suit properties were sold by the 2nd\n\n respondent by way of a registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, vide Document\n\n No. 361 of 2013, in favour of D. Maddhaiyan, G. Rajendran, and P.K.\n\n Duraisamy. Subsequently, the 2nd respondent executed a rectification deed on\n\n 31.08.2015, vide Document No. 3035 of 2015, to correct an error in the survey\n\n number mentioned in the original sale deed. Thus, as early as 26.07.2013, the\n\n 2nd respondent, the vendor of the vendors of the revision petitioner under the\n\n agreement dated 05.05.2011 had already conveyed the suit properties by way of\n\n 29 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n a valid registered sale, and it is this sale that was sought to be annulled in the\n\n suit filed in O.S. No. 21 of 2020 by Advocate I. Veerasamy, who had arrayed\n\n himself as the plaintiff.\n\n 29. It is pertinent to note that Advocate I. Veerasamy, a practising\n\n lawyer, is none other than the brother of the 2nd respondent, A. Madhu. In his\n\n plaint in O.S.No.21 of 2020, Advocate-I.Veerasamy not only sought relief\n\n against the 2nd respondent but also against the other family members.\n\n 30. In the plaint filed in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, Advocate I. Veerasamy\n\n alleged that the suit properties were joint family properties, though purchased in\n\n the name of the 2nd respondent. It was further contended that the 2nd\n\n respondent had executed the sale deed with the intention of defeating the rights\n\n of the other family members. Accordingly, he prayed for a judgement and\n\n decree declaring the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 as null and void, in addition to\n\n seeking the reliefs of partition and permanent injunction.\n\n 31. Along with the suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020, Advocate I. Veerasamy\n\n also filed an application in I.A. No. 131 of 2020 under Order XXXIX Rules 1\n\n and 2 \nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n, seeking an ad-interim injunction.\n\n However, the said application was dismissed on merits by the learned District\n\n Munsif by order dated 29.10.2021.Subsequently, Advocate I. Veerasamy filed a\n\n memo expressing his intention not to pursue the suit any further and sought\n\n 30 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n permission to withdraw the same. Notably, he did not seek to reserve his right\n\n to institute a fresh suit on the same cause of action. Accepting his request, the\n\n learned District Munsif dismissed the suit as not pressed by judgement dated\n\n 15.11.2021.\n\n 32. From the foregoing facts, it is evident that Advocate I. Veerasamy, a\n\n practising Advocate who is the brother of the 2nd respondent, was well aware\n\n of the sale of the suit property as early as July 2013. He had himself instituted a\n\n suit challenging the sale deed dated 26.07.2013 executed by his brother, the 2nd\n\n respondent – A. Madhu, in favour of D. Madhaiyan and two others. However,\n\n the said suit was later withdrawn by Advocate I. Veerasamy on his own\n\n volition, without reserving liberty to file a fresh suit on the same cause of\n\n action. Thereafter, Advocate I. Veerasamy himself instituted the suit in\n\n O.S.No.16 of 2023 on behalf of the 1st respondent – Ganesan, seeking specific\n\n performance of the so-called agreement of sale dated 05.05.2011.\n\n 33. It is pertinent to note that the 1st defendant in the said suit, A. Madhu,\n\n is none other than the brother of Advocate I. Veerasamy. The suit in O.S.No.16\n\n of 2023 came to be filed for specific performance by the very same advocate\n\n who had earlier challenged the sale deed executed by his own brother in the suit\n\n in O.S.No.21 of 2020 and subsequently withdrew that suit without reserving\n\n any liberty. However, while drafting the plaint in O.S. No. 16 of 2023,\n\n 31 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n Advocate I. Veerasamy deliberately maintained complete silence with respect\n\n to the prior transactions involving the very same properties. He conveniently\n\n omitted any reference to the earlier sale deed dated 26.07.2013, which he had\n\n himself challenged in his own suit in O.S. No. 21 of 2020. Such suppression is\n\n glaring and cannot be overlooked, particularly when the same advocate, fully\n\n aware of the prior transaction, chose not to disclose it in the subsequent suit.\n\n The deliberate omission raises serious concerns and casts a shadow over the\n\n bona fides of the suit, suggesting that the suppression was intentional and for\n\n reasons best known to Advocate I. Veerasamy, his brother A. Madhu.\n\n 34. Despite being fully aware of the registered sale deed executed by his\n\n brother, A. Madhu, on 26.07.2013 in favour of D. Madhaiyan, G. Rajendran,\n\n and P.K. Duraisamy, Advocate I. Veerasamy, while filing the suit in O.S. No.\n\n 16 of 2023 for specific performance, deliberately chose not to implead the said\n\n purchasers as parties to the suit. Instead, he arrayed only his brother, A. Madhu,\n\n the 2nd respondent herein as a defendant, along with certain Government\n\n officials. The conscious omission of necessary parties, despite knowledge of\n\n their direct interest in the subject matter, further reinforces the inference of\n\n deliberate suppression and calls into question the bona fides of the suit. This\n\n court is unable to comprehend how the Sub Registrar, Pennagaram, District\n\n 32 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n Registrar, Dharmapuri and District Collector, Dharmapuri were necessary\n\n parties to the issue relating to enforcement of a contract.\n\n 35. Having chosen to implead his brother-A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent\n\n herein and certain government officials of the State as party defendants in the\n\n suit in O.S.No.16 of 2023, Advocate - I. Veerasamy, however, failed to\n\n implead the purchasers - D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran and P.K.Duraisamy, who\n\n had acquired the suit properties from the said A.Madhu, the 2nd respondent\n\n herein under the registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, as well as the\n\n subsequent purchasers, namely the revision petitioners herein, who had\n\n purchased the same properties on 13.12.2017 from D.Maddhaiyan, G.Rajendran\n\n and P.K.Duraisamy. Despite their clear and direct interest in the subject matter\n\n of the suit, those purchasers were deliberately omitted from the array of parties\n\n in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, thereby rendering the suit defective for non-joinder of\n\n necessary parties.\n\n 36. In the suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the 2nd respondent, A. Madhu—\n\n who was arrayed as the 1st defendant, conveniently remained ex parte, thereby\n\n allowing the suit to be decreed ex parte. It is not in dispute that A. Madhu, the\n\n 2nd respondent herein had already sold the subject properties as early as July\n\n 2013 to D. Maddhaiyan, G. Rajendran, and P.K. Duraisamy. His brother,\n\n Advocate I. Veerasamy, who is a practising lawyer, was fully aware of the said\n\n 33 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n transaction and had even instituted a suit (O.S.No.21 of 2020) challenging the\n\n said sale, which he later withdrew.\n\n 37. However, in the subsequent suit in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, Advocate I.\n\n Veerasamy, while acting as counsel for the plaintiff—Ganesan (1st respondent\n\n herein), conveniently omitted to implead the subsequent purchasers, including\n\n the revision petitioners herein, who had acquired the properties on 13.12.2017,\n\n as party defendants. This Court is of the considered view that such omission\n\n was not inadvertent but a deliberate act aimed at suppressing material facts\n\n relating to the prior alienation of the suit properties. The suppression of the\n\n subsequent sale transactions, particularly in a suit for specific performance,\n\n amounts to a clear and calculated act of fraud.\n\n 38. Had the subsequent purchasers been impleaded as parties in the suit,\n\n they would have had the opportunity to contest the claim and establish that the\n\n properties were transferred to them for valuable consideration, in good faith,\n\n and without notice of any prior agreement. The failure to implead them,\n\n coupled with the ex parte conduct of the 1st defendant, leads this Court to\n\n conclude that the decree was obtained by playing fraud upon the Court, thereby\n\n vitiating the very foundation of the judgement and decree passed in O.S. No. 16\n\n of 2023.\n\n 34 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n 39. It is now well settled that an agreement for sale can be enforced\n\n against a subsequent purchaser only if it is shown that such purchaser had\n\n notice of the prior agreement and that the purchase was not made in good faith\n\n or for valuable consideration. Only in order to circumvent such legal\n\n complications, the suit for specific performance in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 was\n\n cleverly instituted without impleading the subsequent purchasers as party\n\n defendants.\n\n 40. The pleadings in the earlier suit, O.S. No. 21 of 2020, filed by\n\n Advocate I. Veerasamy as plaintiff, clearly indicate that the subject properties\n\n were sold on 26.07.2013. Significantly, it was not his case in that suit that the\n\n sale consideration was not paid by the purchasers. If the agreement of sale dated\n\n 05.11.2011 had in fact been executed in favour of the 1st respondent and was in\n\n existence, such a vital fact ought to have been disclosed, in all fairness, in the\n\n pleadings of O.S. No. 21 of 2020.\n\n 41. The omission to mention the alleged agreement dated 05.05.2011 in\n\n the earlier suit and the subsequent filing of O.S. No. 16 of 2023 without\n\n impleading the known purchasers clearly reveal a concerted effort to suppress\n\n material facts. These circumstances strongly suggest that the 1st respondent is\n\n merely a name-lender, and that the suit is a result of collusion between the 2nd\n\n 35 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n respondent and his brother, Advocate I. Veerasamy.\n\n 42. This conclusion is further fortified by the inherently improbable\n\n conduct of the 1st respondent, who, despite allegedly paying the entire sale\n\n consideration of Rs. 80,000/- on 05.05.2011, failed to take any steps whatsoever\n\n for over twelve years to enforce the agreement. Such prolonged and\n\n unexplained silence is wholly against with the normal conduct of an ordinary\n\n prudent man, which casts serious doubt on the genuineness of the alleged\n\n transaction.\n\n 43. The cumulative facts and circumstances discussed hereinabove lead\n\n to the inescapable conclusion that the suit for specific performance in O.S. No.\n\n 16 of 2023 was clearly an afterthought, and the agreement of sale dated\n\n 05.05.2011 is antedated with the sole object of achieving, through indirect\n\n means, what could not be achieved directly through the earlier suit in O.S. No.\n\n 21 of 2020 filed by Advocate I. Veerasamy.\n\n 44. The very pleadings in the plaint in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the conduct\n\n of the parties, the deliberate non-joinder of necessary parties, and the manner in\n\n which the 1st respondent – Ganesan obtained an ex parte decree and\n\n subsequently got a sale deed executed in his favour through the executing court,\n\n all point to a clear abuse of process.\n\n 36 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n 45. Such a sale deed, executed in furtherance of a decree obtained by\n\n suppressing material facts and without impleading the true and lawful\n\n purchasers of the suit properties, cannot confer any valid title upon the 1st\n\n respondent. Merely because an ex parte decree was passed in the suit for\n\n specific performance and a sale deed was executed in pursuance thereof, it does\n\n not ipso facto confer any valid title upon the 1st respondent. It is an undisputed\n\n fact that the 2nd respondent – A. Madhu, had already conveyed the subject\n\n properties by way of a registered sale deed dated 26.07.2013, and therefore, on\n\n the date when the executing court purported to execute a sale deed in favour of\n\n the 1st respondent pursuant to the decree in O.S. No. 16 of 2023, the 2nd\n\n respondent no longer held any title to convey.\n\n 46. In the absence of impleadment of the subsequent bona fide\n\n purchasers, and in view of the fraudulent suppression of these transactions, the\n\n entire proceedings culminating in the ex parte decree and execution thereof are\n\n vitiated. Consequently, the decree for specific performance and the sale deed\n\n executed pursuant thereto are liable to be set aside as nullities in the eye of law.\n\n 47. In view of the foregoing discussion, this Court is of the considered\n\n opinion that the decree for specific performance obtained in O.S. No. 16 of\n\n 2023 was the result of a calculated and deliberate suppression of material facts,\n\n 37 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n including the prior alienation of the suit properties and the purchasers were not\n\n impleaded as parties. The suit was engineered in collusion between the 1st and\n\n 2nd respondents, with the active connivance of Advocate I. Veerasamy, who\n\n had personal knowledge of all relevant transactions but chose to withhold the\n\n same from the Court. Such conduct constitutes a clear abuse of the process of\n\n court and amounts to playing fraud upon the court. It is a settled principle of\n\n law that a decree obtained by fraud is a nullity and can be declared as such even\n\n in collateral proceedings. Therefore, this Court finds that the ex parte decree\n\n dated 26.09.2023 passed in O.S. No. 16 of 2023 on the file of the learned\n\n District Munsif, Pennagaram, and the consequential sale deed executed by the\n\n executing court in favour of the 1st respondent, are vitiated by fraud and are\n\n hence null and void in the eye of law. This is a fit case warranting the exercise\n\n of this Court’s supervisory jurisdiction under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of\n\n India. This Court is therefore of the considered view that the extraordinary\n\n supervisory jurisdiction under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India is\n\n required to be exercised in this case. Accordingly, the impugned decree and sale\n\n deed are hereby set aside.\n\n In the result, the civil revision petition is allowed in the following terms:\n\n 38 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n (1) The judgement and decree dated 29.09.2023 passed in\n\n O.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the learned District Munsif cum Judicial\n\n Magistrate, Pennagaram, Dharmapuri District, are hereby set aside.\n\n (2) The sale deed dated 15.11.2024 executed by the District\n\n Munsif, Pennagaram, Dharmapuri District, on behalf the 2nd respondent-\n\n A.Madhu (1st defendant in O.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the District Munsif,\n\n Pennagaram) Son of Abimannan, in favour of the 1st respondent-Ganesan\n\n (Plaintiff in O.S.No.16 of 2023 on the file of the District Munsif, Pennagaram)\n\n Son of Selvam is hereby declared as null and void and non-est in the eye of law.\n\n Considering the special circumstances of the case, this court is not\n\n inclined to pass any orders on costs and the parties in this revision shall bear\n\n their own costs incurred on this revision petition.\n\n Consequently, connected CMP is closed.\n\n Index : yes / no 24..06..2025\n Neutral Citation : yes / no\n\n kmk\n\n To\n\n 1.The District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate, Pennagaram,\n\n 39 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )\n\n\f C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n N.SATHISH KUMAR.J.,\n kmk\n\n C.R.P.No.1602 of 2025\n\n 24..06..2025\n\n 40 of 40\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 12/08/2025 04:18:45 pm )",
