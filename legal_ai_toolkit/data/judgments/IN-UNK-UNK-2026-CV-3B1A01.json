Senior Civil Judge & JMFC, Chitradurga arising out of\n\nCrime No.45/2023 registered by Chitradurga Women Police\n\nStation, Chitradurga District for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 304B\n, \n498A\n, \n323\n, \n504\n, \n114\n R/w 34 of \nIPC\n & Sections\n\nof 3 & 4 of \nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n is before this Court\n\nunder \nSection 439\n of Cr.P.C,.\n\n 2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and\n\nlearned High Court Government Pleader for respondent - State.\n\n 3. On the basis of the complaint lodged by\n\nNagendrappa S/o Late Ningappa dated 09.04.2023, FIR in\n\nCrime No.45/2023 was registered by Chitradurga Women Police\n\nagainst the petitioner herein and 3 others for the aforesaid\n\noffences. In the complaint it is averred that, the complainant's\n\ndaughter Roja was married to the petitioner herein on\n\n26.12.2016 and at the time of marriage, the complainant had\n\n -3-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:34132\n\n CRL.P No. 8108 of 2023\n\ngiven dowry to the petitioner as demanded. However, the\n\npetitioner and his family members continued to harass her and\n\nill-treated the complainant's daughter on the ground that she\n\nhad not brought sufficient dowry at the time of marriage. It is\n\nfurther alleged in the complaint that, the petitioner was in illicit\n\nrelationship with accused no.3-Yashoda who was working in his\n\nphoto studio and he was harassing his wife Roja stating that he\n\nintended to marry Yashoda. On 09.04.2023, the complainant\n\nwas informed that his daughter was taken to the hospital.\n\nImmediately the complainant went there and found that his\n\ndaughter had died and her dead body was shifted to mortuary.\n\nThe complainant suspected the hand of the petitioner in the\n\ndeath of his daughter and therefore he had registered a\n\ncomplaint which had resulted in registering FIR in Crime\n\nNo.45/2023 against the petitioner and 3 others initially for the\n\noffence punishable under Sections 302, 323, 114, 304B, 498A,\n\n504 R/w 34 of \nIPC\n & Sections of 3 & 4 of \nDowry Prohibition Act,\n\n1961\n. During the course of investigation, the petitioner was\n\narrested on 11.04.2023. Investigation in the case is complete\n\nand charge sheet has been filed against the petitioner and in\n\nthe charge sheet, \nSection 302\n of IPC has been dropped. The\n\n -4-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:34132\n\n CRL.P No. 8108 of 2023\n\nbail application under \nSection 439\n of Cr.P.C, filed by the\n\npetitioner before the court of Prl. District & Sessions Judge,\n\nChitradurga in Crl.Misc.No.911/2023 was dismissed on\n\n08.08.2023. It is under these circumstances, the petitioner is\n\nbefore this court.\n\n 4. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner having\n\nreiterated the grounds urged in the petition submits that even\n\nif the charge sheet material is presumed to be true, the offence\n\npunishable under Section 304B cannot be made out against the\n\npetitioner. Accordingly, he prays to allow the petition.\n\n 5. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader\n\nfor respondent - State has opposed the bail application.\n\n 6. Deceased Roja was married to the petitioner on\n\n26.12.2016 and the material on record would go to show that\n\nthey have two children from the said wedlock. In the complaint\n\nit is averred that, the petitioner had illicit relationship with\n\naccused no.3-Yashodha who was working in his photo studio\n\nand the deceased Roja had enquired with the petitioner about\n\nhis relationship with Yashoda.\n\n -5-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:34132\n\n CRL.P No. 8108 of 2023\n\n 7. It is the case of the prosecution that the deceased\n\nRoja before committing suicide had left a death note. A perusal\n\nof the death note would indicate that there is no allegation or\n\naverment made in the death note with regard to any demand\n\nfor dowry by the petitioner or his family members. In the death\n\nnote it is stated that, since the petitioner had illicit relationship\n\nwith accused no.3- Yashoda, the deceased was frustrated and\n\nmentally upset and therefore she had taken the extreme step\n\nof committing suicide. For attracting offence punishable under\n\nSection 304B\n of IPC, immediately prior to deceased committing\n\nthe act of suicide, the husband or his relatives should have\n\nindulged in such an act, amounting to harassing or torturing\n\nthe deceased in furtherance of their demand for dowry. Such\n\nan ingredient is not found in the death note of the deceased.\n\nThe charge sheet allegation with regard to such act committed\n\nby the petitioner is required to be proved in a full-fledged trial.\n\nThe petitioner is in custody since 11.04.2023 and he has no\n\ncriminal antecedents. Under these circumstances, I am of the\n\nview that the prayer made by the petitioner for grant of regular\n\nbail is required to be answered affirmatively.\n\n -6-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:34132\n\n CRL.P No. 8108 of 2023\n\n 8. In view of the above, the petition is allowed. The\n\npetitioner/accused No.1 is directed to be enlarged on bail in\n\nC.C.No.461/2023 pending on the file of I Addl. Senior Civil\n\nJudge & JMFC, Chitradurga arising out of Crime No.45/2023\n\nregistered by Chitradurga Women Police Station, Chitradurga\n\nDistrict for the offences punishable under Sections 304B, 498A,\n\n323, 504, 114 R/w 34 of \nIPC\n & Sections of 3 & 4 of \nDowry\n\nProhibition Act, 1961\n, subject to the following conditions:\n\n a) The petitioner shall execute\n\n personal bond for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-\n\n (Rupees One lakhs only) with one surety for\n\n the likesum, to the satisfaction of the\n\n jurisdictional Court;\n\n b) The petitioner shall appear\n\n regularly on all the dates of hearing before\n\n the Trial Court unless the Trial Court\n\n exempts his appearance for valid reasons;\n\n c) The petitioner shall not directly or\n\n indirectly threaten or tamper with the\n\n prosecution witnesses;\n\n -7-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:34132\n\n CRL.P No. 8108 of 2023\n\n d) The petitioner shall not leave the\n jurisdiction of the Trial Court without\n\n permission of the said Court until the case\n registered against him is disposed off.\n\n SD/-\n\n JUDGE\n\nNMS",
