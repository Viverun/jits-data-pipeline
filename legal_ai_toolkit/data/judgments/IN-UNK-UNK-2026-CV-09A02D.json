However, in private\n\n projects having plot area of more than one\n\n hectare, relaxation shall be allowed by the State\n Government only.\n\n According to the Technical Committee, after\n\n examining the technical and legal aspects of the case, it was\n\n found that the case of the petitioner for proposed construction\n\n of retail outlet pump as stated above is a public utility and is\n\n located in Non-Core Area of Shimla Planning Area.\n\n Furthermore, the Committee also found that the construction\n\n proposed is not in relation to building construction but only for\n\n the development of land/site in question and, therefore,\n\n following two relaxations are required in the instant case:-\n\n i. Hill cutting beyond permissible limits of 3.50 mtrs.\n\n ii. Relaxation in overall slope of the site from 52\n\n degrees to 45 degrees.\n\n As regards the first relaxation, it is not in dispute that\n\n only application for sanctioning of plans for construction are\n\n required to be submitted to the concerned department, which\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:37 :::CIS\n\n in turn shall then ensure that no construction activity takes\n\n place where the slope is more than 45 degrees/35 degrees.\n\n .\n\n As regards the second relaxation, the proposal for retail\n\n petrol pump outlet is to be constructed in and around 20\n\n metres of the total plot area and this condition is duly fulfilled\n\n by the petitioner. Once that be so, obviously, the slope where\n\n the construction is proposed will naturally be less than 45\n\n degrees once the hill cutting is carried out.\n\n In such circumstances, we direct the respondents to\n\n consider the case of the petitioner for relaxation as aforesaid\n\n within a period of two weeks from today.\n\n For compliance to come up on 23.5.2022.\n\n \n(Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\n\n Judge\n\n (Chander Bhusan Barowalia)\n Judge\n\n 2.5.2022\n (mamta/himani)\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:37 :::CIS\n\n M/s. \nAPJ Laboratories Vs.

This application was filed after\n\n more than 45 years of sanction of the mutation. Yet, it has not\n\n only been entertained by the Deputy Commissioner, Mandi,\n\n but he in turn has called for the report of Tehsildar Balh,\n\n district Mandi.\n\n It is really surprising as to how the Deputy\n\n Commissioner, Mandi could have called for the report without\n\n going into the question whether the application filed by the\n\n petitioner was within prescribed period of limitation and the\n\n same was either maintainable. Even otherwise, no provisions\n\n of law have been quoted in the application, which could\n\n indicate the jurisdiction of the Collector/Deputy\n\n Commissioner, Mandi.\n\n In such circumstances, issue notice. Mr. Vinod\n\n Thakur, learned Additional Advocate General appears and\n\n waives service of notice on behalf of the respondents.\n\n Reply/instructions be filed within six weeks. In the\n\n meanwhile, further proceedings in the application for\n\n cancellation of mutation filed by the petitioner, which is stated\n\n to be pending before second respondent, shall remain stayed.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:37 :::CIS\n\n List on 10.5.2022.\n\n CMP No.1959 of 2022\n\n .\n\n The application, as prayed for, is allowed and\n\n the applicant is exempted from filing the English\n\n translation of Annexures in question.

Ordered accordingly.\n\n We make it absolutely clear that each of the stake\n\n holders shall be free to voice his grievance(s) including fixation\n\n of quota of trucks, if any.\n\n List on 1.9.2021.\n\n (Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\n Judge\n\n (Satyen Vaidya)\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:39 :::CIS\n\n Judge\n 7.7.2021\n (pankaj)\n\n .\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:39 :::CIS\n\n FAO No. 22/2021\n\n6.7.2021 Present: Mr. Nitin Thakur, Advocate, for the appellant.\n\n .\n\n (Through Video Conferencing)\n\n A sum of Rs. 10,000/- has been deposited,\n\n however remaining amount of Rs. 2 lacs has not been\n\n deposited.\n\n It is noticed that the period to comply with the\n\n order dated 16.6.2021 has not elapsed, therefore, list for\n\n consideration on the date already fixed.\n\n (Tarlok Singh Chauhan)\n Judge\n\n (Satyen Vaidya)\n Judge\n\n 6.7.2021\n (pankaj)\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 15/05/2023 20:39:39 :::CIS\n\n CWPOA No. 136/2020\n\n6.7.2021 Present: Mr. Vikas Rajput, Advocate, for the petitioner.\n\n .\n\n Mr. Ashok Sharma, A.G. with Mr. Vinod Thakur,\n\n Mr. Hemanshu Misra, Mr. Shiv Pal Minhans, Addl.\n A.Gs., Mr. J.
