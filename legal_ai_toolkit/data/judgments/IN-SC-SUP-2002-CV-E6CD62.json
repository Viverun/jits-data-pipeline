Leave granted.\n\nThe appellant in this appeal is the widow of a Railway\nemployee who died in harness on 21st November, 1969. According\nto the appellant, she was entitled for family pension on the death of\nher husband, but because of ignorance and lack of legal assistance,\nshe could not stake her claim for family pension till 12.3.1991.\nWhen she made an application for grant of family pension to the\nDivisional Railway Manager (Personal) of South Central Railway\n(Vijaywada), her claim for said pension was rejected by the\nRailways on 24.3.1992 on the ground that her husband on the date\nof his death was not in the service of Railways because he was\nearlier medically invalidated. The appellant pursued her claim by\nrepresentations to the Railways which having failed, she filed a\nwrit petition before the High Court of Judicature: Andhra Pradesh\nat Hyderabad in the year 1992 which came up for consideration\nbefore a learned Single Judge of the High Court who was pleased\nto allow the writ petition and directed the respondent-Railways to\nfix and pay the family pension payable to the appellant, according\nto the rules, with arrears w.e.f. the date of death of the appellant's\nhusband i.e. 21st of November, 1969.\n\nWhile giving the above direction, the learned Single Judge\nrejected the contention of the Railways that the appellant's\nhusband was medically invalidated. He also rejected the\ncontention of the Railways that under the Rules or the Scheme the\nappellant was not entitled to family pension. The further contention\nof the Railways that the appellant had an alternate remedy in\napproaching the Central Administrative Tribunal was also rejected.\nThe aggrieved respondent-Railways preferred an appeal\nbefore a Division Bench of the same High Court in writ appeal\nNo.1890/99. The Appellate Bench agreed with the learned Single\nJudge in regard to the right of the appellant for receiving family\npension and also rejected the argument of the Railways in regard to\nthe availability of alternate remedy. It, however, held that since\nthere was some latches on the part of the appellant in approaching\nthe court, it applied the principle of law of limitation applicable to\nsuits and confined the retrospective benefit given by the learned\nSingle Judge to a period subsequent to 1.4.1992 the date on which\na legal notice was given by the appellant.\n\nIn this appeal, the appellant questions this restriction on her\nright to claim family pension w.e.f. 21.11.1969 the date on which\nher husband died. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the\nDivision Bench having agreed with the learned Single Judge on the\nlegal right of the appellant to receive family pension ought not to\nhave confined the said right to a date much subsequent to the death\nof her husband, merely because a demand for payment of family\npension was made only in the year 1992. Learned counsel for the\nappellant pointed out from the judgment of the Division Bench\nitself that it had held that the denial of family pension to the\nappellant amounted to violation of her fundamental right to life\nguaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution and that the\nDivision Bench had also held that in the circumstances of this case\nthe delay in approaching the railway authorities cannot be\nconsidered to be fatal for the maintainability of the writ petition.\nThe learned counsel submitted, based on these findings, that the\nDivision Bench could not have restricted the appellant's claim to a\ndate much subsequent to the date of death of her husband. Per\ncontra, the learned counsel for the railways contended that the\ndelay in approaching the court was so large that it was not a fit\ncase for the exercise of the discretionary remedy under\nArticle 226\n\nof the Constitution and that the High Court was in fact very\ngenerous to the appellant in granting the relief from the year 1992.\nWe notice that the appellant's husband was working as a\nGangman who died while in service. It is on record that the\nappellant is an illiterate who at that time did not know of her legal\nright and had no access to any information as to her right to family\npension and to enforce her such right. On the death of the husband\nof the appellant, it was obligatory for her husband's employer, viz.,\nRailways, in this case to have computed the family pension\npayable to the appellant and offered the same to her without her\nhaving to make a claim or without driving her to a litigation. The\nvery denial of her right to family pension as held by the learned\nSingle Judge as well as the Division Bench is an erroneous\ndecision on the part of the Railways and in fact amounting to a\nviolation of the guarantee assured to the appellant under\nArticle 21\n\nof the Constitution. The factum of the appellant's lack of resources\nto approach the legal forum timely is not disputed by the Railways.\nQuestion then arises on facts and circumstances of this case, the\nAppellate Bench was justified in restricting the past arrears of\npension to a period much subsequent to the death of appellant's\nhusband on which date she had legally become entitled to the grant\nof pension ? In this case as noticed by us herein above, the learned\nSingle Judge had rejected the contention of delay put forth by the\nRailways and taking note of the appellant's right to pension and\nthe denial of the same by the Railways illegally considered it\nappropriate to grant the pension with retrospective effect from the\ndate on which it became due to her. The Division Bench also while\nagreeing with the learned Single Judge observed that the delay in\napproaching the Railways by the appellant for the grant of family\npension was not fatal inspite of the same it restricted the payment\nof family pension from a date on which the appellant issued a legal\nnotice to the Railways i.e. on 1.4.1992. We think on the facts of\nthis case inasmuch as it was an obligation of the Railways to have\ncomputed the family pension and offered the same to the widow of\nits employee as soon as it became due to her and also in view of\nthe fact her husband was only a Gangman in the Railways who\nmight not have left behind sufficient resources for the appellant to\nagitate her rights and also in view of the fact that the appellant is\nan illiterate. The learned Single Judge, in our opinion, was justified\nin granting the relief to the appellant from the date from which it\nbecame due to her, that is the date of the death of her husband.\nConsequently, we are of the considered opinion that the Division\nBench fell in error in restricting that period to a date subsequent to\n1.4.1992.\n\nIn the said view of the matter, we allow this appeal, set aside\nthe impugned order of the Division Bench to the extent that it\nrestricts the right of the appellant to receive family pension only\nfrom 1.4.1992 and restore that right of the appellant as conferred\non her by the learned Single Judge, that is from the date\n21.11.1969. The Railways will take steps forthwith to compute the\narrears of pension payable to the appellant w.e.f 21.11.1969 and\npay the entire arrears within three months from the date of the\nreceipt of this order and continue to pay her future pension.\nFor the reasons stated above, this appeal succeeds to the\nextent mentioned herein above and the same is allowed with costs\nof Rs.10,000/-(Rs. Ten thousand only).",

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 04/12/2002  BENCH: N.SANTOSH HEGDE & B.P.SINGH.  JUDGMENT:  J U D G M E N T  (ARISING OUT OF SLPNO.18565 OF 2001)  SANTOSH HEGDE,J.  HEARD LEARNED COUNSEL. LEAVE GRANTED.  THE APPELLANT IN THIS APPEAL IS THE WIDOW OF A RAILWAY EMPLOYEE WHO DIED IN HARNESS ON 21ST NOVEMBER, 1969. ACCORDING TO THE APPELLANT, SHE WAS ENTITLED FOR FAMILY PENSION ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, BUT BECAUSE OF IGNORANCE AND LACK OF LEGAL ASSISTANCE, SHE COULD NOT STAKE HER CLAIM FOR FAMILY PENSION TILL 12.3.1991. WHEN SHE MADE AN APPLICATION FOR GRANT OF FAMILY PENSION TO THE DIVISIONAL RAILWAY MANAGER (PERSONAL) OF SOUTH CENTRAL RAILWAY (VIJAYWADA), HER CLAIM FOR SAID PENSION WAS REJECTED BY THE RAILWAYS ON 24.3.1992 ON THE GROUND THAT HER HUSBAND ON THE DATE OF HIS DEATH WAS NOT IN THE SERVICE OF RAILWAYS BECAUSE HE WAS EARLIER MEDICALLY INVALIDATED. THE APPELLANT PURSUED HER CLAIM BY REPRESENTATIONS TO THE RAILWAYS WHICH HAVING FAILED, SHE FILED A WRIT PETITION BEFORE THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE: ANDHRA PRADESH AT HYDERABAD IN THE YEAR 1992 WHICH CAME UP FOR CONSIDERATION BEFORE A LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE OF THE HIGH COURT WHO WAS PLEASED TO ALLOW THE WRIT PETITION AND DIRECTED THE RESPONDENT-RAILWAYS TO FIX AND PAY THE FAMILY PENSION PAYABLE TO THE APPELLANT, ACCORDING TO THE RULES, WITH ARREARS W.E.F. THE DATE OF DEATH OF THE APPELLANT'S HUSBAND I.E. 21ST OF NOVEMBER, 1969.  WHILE GIVING THE ABOVE DIRECTION, THE LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE REJECTED THE CONTENTION OF THE RAILWAYS THAT THE APPELLANT'S HUSBAND WAS MEDICALLY INVALIDATED. HE ALSO REJECTED THE CONTENTION OF THE RAILWAYS THAT UNDER THE RULES OR THE SCHEME THE APPELLANT WAS NOT ENTITLED TO FAMILY PENSION. THE FURTHER CONTENTION OF THE RAILWAYS THAT THE APPELLANT HAD AN ALTERNATE REMEDY IN APPROACHING THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNAL WAS ALSO REJECTED. THE AGGRIEVED RESPONDENT-RAILWAYS PREFERRED AN APPEAL BEFORE A DIVISION BENCH OF THE SAME HIGH COURT IN WRIT APPEAL NO.1890/99. THE APPELLATE BENCH AGREED WITH THE LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE IN REGARD TO THE RIGHT OF THE APPELLANT FOR RECEIVING FAMILY PENSION AND ALSO REJECTED THE ARGUMENT OF THE RAILWAYS IN REGARD TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATE REMEDY. IT, HOWEVER, HELD THAT SINCE THERE WAS SOME LATCHES ON THE PART OF THE APPELLANT IN APPROACHING THE COURT, IT APPLIED THE PRINCIPLE OF LAW OF LIMITATION APPLICABLE TO SUITS AND CONFINED THE RETROSPECTIVE BENEFIT GIVEN BY THE LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE TO A PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO 1.4.1992 THE DATE ON WHICH A LEGAL NOTICE WAS GIVEN BY THE APPELLANT.  IN THIS APPEAL, THE APPELLANT QUESTIONS THIS RESTRICTION ON HER RIGHT TO CLAIM FAMILY PENSION W.E.F. 21.11.1969 THE DATE ON WHICH HER HUSBAND DIED. IT IS SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT THAT THE DIVISION BENCH HAVING AGREED WITH THE LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE ON THE LEGAL RIGHT OF THE APPELLANT TO RECEIVE FAMILY PENSION OUGHT NOT TO HAVE CONFINED THE SAID RIGHT TO A DATE MUCH SUBSEQUENT TO THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND, MERELY BECAUSE A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT OF FAMILY PENSION WAS MADE ONLY IN THE YEAR 1992. LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT POINTED OUT FROM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DIVISION BENCH ITSELF THAT IT HAD HELD THAT THE DENIAL OF FAMILY PENSION TO THE APPELLANT AMOUNTED TO VIOLATION OF HER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO LIFE GUARANTEED UNDER ARTICLE 21 OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT THE DIVISION BENCH HAD ALSO HELD THAT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE THE DELAY IN APPROACHING THE RAILWAY AUTHORITIES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE FATAL FOR THE MAINTAINABILITY OF THE WRIT PETITION. THE LEARNED COUNSEL SUBMITTED, BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THAT THE DIVISION BENCH COULD NOT HAVE RESTRICTED THE APPELLANT'S CLAIM TO A DATE MUCH SUBSEQUENT TO THE DATE OF DEATH OF HER HUSBAND. PER CONTRA, THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE RAILWAYS CONTENDED THAT THE DELAY IN APPROACHING THE COURT WAS SO LARGE THAT IT WAS NOT A FIT CASE FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE DISCRETIONARY REMEDY UNDER ARTICLE 226  OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THAT THE HIGH COURT WAS IN FACT VERY GENEROUS TO THE APPELLANT IN GRANTING THE RELIEF FROM THE YEAR 1992.
