Clause 5 of O.M. dated 22.10-1983 is clear\nthat such Central Government employees who got\nthemselves absorbed under Central Public Sector\nUndertakings prior to 1.4.1979 and opted to receive\ncommuted raise for 1/3rd of pension as well as terminal\nbenefit equal to the commuted value of the balance amount of\npension were not entitled to any benefit as they were not\nCentral Government Pensioners as on 1.4-1979.

Rao, K. Jagan Mohan Rao and Raju Ramachandran for\nthe Petitioners.\n\n V.C. Mahajan, Ms. A Subhashini and R.B. Mishra for the\nRespondent.\n\n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n KASLIWAL, J. The above writ petitions and appeal are\ndisposed of by one single order as identical question of law\nare involved in these cases. In order to appreciate the\ncontroversy we would narrate the facts of the writ\npetitions. Shri Des Raj Bhatnagar, Petitioner DES No. 1 and\nShri Ved Pal Seth, Petitioner No.2 were employees of the\n\n 359\n\nCentral Government. The petitioner No. 1 after serving in\nvarious capacities in the Department of food of the Central\nGovernment from 24.10.1941 to 31.8.1971 (29 years and 10\nmonths) was permanently absorbed in Food Corporation of\nIndia as Assistant on 1st September, 1971 and retired from\nthe Government service.\n\n The petitioner No. 2 after serving the Government in\nvarious capacities for the period from 5.11.1947 to 8.2.1972\n(20 years and 3 months) was permanently absorbed on 9.2.1972\nin Food Corporation of India as Sr. Asstt. Manager and\nretired from the Government service.\n\n On absorption in the Food Corporation of India, the\npetitioners were required to exercise either of the\nfollowing two options:\n\n (a) Receiving the pro-rata monthly pension and\ndeath-cum-retirement gratuity as admissible under the rules;\nand\n\n (b) Receiving the pro-rata gratuity and a lumpsum\namount in lieu of pension worked out with reference to\ncommutation table obtaining on the date from which the\npension was to be admissible and under the option order.\n\n The office of the Pay and Accounts Officer, Ministry of\nFood and Agriculture determined the original pension payable\nto the petitioners per mensem. The petitioners were\nsanctioned original pensions in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules,\n1972. In case of petitioner No. 1 the original pension was\ndetermined at Rs. 240 per mensem payable from 1st September,\n1971.In case of petitioner No. 2 the original pension\nadmissible was determined at Rs.287 per mensem payable from\n9.2.1972.\n\n The petitioner No. I received his pension @ Rs.240 per\nmensem for the period from 1.9.1971 to 29.10.1972.\nPetitioner No. 2 received his pension @ Rs.287 per mensem\nfor the period from 9.2.1972 to 16.8.1972. Under the above\nRules maximum of one third of the amount of admissible\npension could be commuted. However, in the case of\nGovernment officers including Industrial Management Pool\nOfficers who were opting for permanent absorption in Public\nSector Undertakings, an option was given to commute the full\namount of their original pension. The petitioner No. I and\npetitioner No. 2 commuted their original pensions for a\nlumpsum of Rs.35,568 and Rs.43,601 on 30.10.1972 and\n17.8.1972 respectively.\n\n 360\n\n The Third Central Pay Commission was required to make\nits recommendations in the matter of providing relief to\nGovernment pensioners. The Pay Commission, in order to\nsecure Government pensioners against the continuing erosion\nin the value of the rupees and to recommend appropriate\nmeasures for protecting the pension of Government servants\nfrom such erosion on account of the possible increase in the\ncase of living in future and after having considered the\nmatter, recommended that irrespective of the amount of\npension drawn by them, pensioners should be given relief at\nthe rate of 5% of their pension subject to a minimum of Rs.5\nper mensem and a maximum of Rs.25 per mensem. The relief at\nthose rates were recommended to be given to the Government\npensioners as and when there was a 16 point rise in the 12\nmonths average of the All India Working Class Consumer Price\nIndex ( 1960- 100). The relief for the first time, at these\nrates was to be paid when the 12th monthly average of this\nindex reached 216. The said recommendation made by the Pay\nCommission was duly accepted by the Central Government.\n\n The Ministry of Finance Office Memorandum No. F. 22(8)-\nEV(A)/75 dated 13.2.1976 inter alia, provided that where an\nofficer on his retirement commutes a portion of his pension\nhe is eligible for relief and ad hoc reliefs in pension on\nthe full amount of original pension as admissible to him.\nUnder the said O.M. the term 'Pension' includes for the\npurposes of ad hoc relief the commuted portion of pension,\nif any. The case of the petitioners is that according to\nthese Rules, an officer who has commuted any part of this\npension and an officer who has not opted for any commutation\nboth receive the full quantum of relief and ad hoc relief on\nfull amount of original pension. It has thus been contended\nthat for the purposes of grant of the full benefit of relief\nor ad hoc relief the Rules do not make any distinction\nbetween an officer who has sought commutation of his\noriginal pension and one who has not sought any such\ncommutation. The petitioner and other Government servants\nwho opted for commutation of their original pension in\naccordance with the Rules are being arbitrarily and without\njust and reasonable cause are deprived of the relief and ad\nhoc relief on commutation in pursuance of the Office\nMemorandum dated 13.2.1976. Though, an officer who commutes\none third of his pension gets relief and ad hoc relief on\nthe basis of original amount of his pension but whereas an\nofficer commutes whole of his original pension is deprived\nof the entire amount of the relief or ad hoc relief. The\npetitioners have thus contended that aforesaid Office\nMemorandum dated 13.2.1976 is vitiated by an inherent\ndiscrimination and is violative of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution.\n\n 361\n\n The petitioners have further submitted that they are\nentitled to the aforesaid reliefs granted to all other\nGovernment pensioners, and the amount of relief to which\npensioners are entitled and has been denied to them under\nthe impugned Office Memorandum dated 13.2. 1976 works\nout to Rs. 13,592 and Rs. 15,040 in case of petitioner No. 1\nand petitioner No. 2 respectively upto 29.2.1984. The\nMinistry of Finance in their Office Memorandum No.\n2(8)/EV/82 dated 10.10.1983 has sanctioned the grant of\nrelief and ad hoc reliefs to Government servants who retired\nprior to 10th September, 1979 @ 92.5% of their original\npension subject to minimum of Rs.93 and maximum of Rs.463\nwith effect from 1st July, 1983. This has been done by\ntaking in view the decline in the purchasing power of the\nrupee and the original sanction being insufficient and\nmeagre to sustain the pensioners.\n\n \nApart from the above the petitioners have submitted\nthat they are also entitled to the benefit of Liberalised\nPension Formula of 1979,which was introduced vide the\nFinance Ministry's Office Memorandum No. F. 19(37)/EV/79\ndated 25.5-1979, in respect of the approved pensionable\nservice rendered by them in the Central Government as\nadmissible to other pensioners who retired from Government\nservice between 17.4.1950 to 31.3.1979. The said\nMemorandum was made applicable only to those Government\nservants who retired from service on or after 31.3.1979.\nHowever, this Court in \nD.S. Nakara & Others v. Union of\nIndia\n, [1983] 2 SCR 165 held that all Central Government\npensioners governed by the Central Civil Service\n(Pension) Rules, 1972 were entitled to pension w.e.f.\n1.4.1979 as computed under the Liberalised Pension Formula\nirrespective of the date of their retirement. Placing\nreliance on \nthe above decision\n it has been claimed that\nthere should be no discrimination between the applicability\nof the Liberalised Pension Formula to pre 31.3.1979\npensioners and there is no just and reasonable cause in\ndenying such benefit to the petitioners under the impugned\nOffice Memorandum No. F. 1(3)/EV/83 dated 22.10.1983.\n Clause 5 of the Office Memorandum dated 22.10.1983 reads\nas under:\n\n \"Central Government employees, who got\n themselves absorbed under Central Public sector\n undertaking/autonomous bodies prior to 1.4.1979\n and have received/or opted to receive commuted\n raise for 1/3rd of pension as well as terminal\n benefit equal to the commuted value of the\n\n 362\n\n balance amount of pension left after commuting\n 1/3rd, of pension, are not entitled to any benefit\n under these orders as they were not Central\n Government pensioners as on 1.4.79. In cases where\n only a portion of pension has been commuted the\n pension will have to be enhanced in accordance\n with these orders with effect from 1.4.1979\".\nThe above clause makes it clear that such Central\nGovernment employees, who got themselves absorbed under\nCentral Public Sector Undertakings prior to 1.4.1979 and\nopted to receive commuted raise for 1/3rd of pension as\nwell as terminal benefit equal to the commuted value of the\nbalance amount of pension left after commuting 1/3rd of\npension were not entitled to any benefit as they were not\nCentral Government pensioners as on 1.4.1979. An identical\nwrit petition No. 1068/1987 under \nArt. 32\n of the\nconstitution was filed on behalf of the Welfare Association\nof absorbed Central Government Employees in Public\nEnterprises and this Court dismissed the said writ petition\non April 12, 1990. \nIn the said writ petition benefit of\nJudgment of this Court in \"Common Cause\" a \nRegistered\nSociety & Ors. v. Union of India\n, [ 1987] 1 SCC 142 was\nclaimed but the same was negatived by making a distinction\nthat the Writ Petition \"Common Cause\" was on behalf of\nthe Government servants who had commuted their pension\npartially and this Court for the reasons indicated in the\njudgment came to hold that on the expiry of 15 years from\nthe date of commutation the entire pension revived. The\npetitioners were persons who had, at the time of retirement\nfrom Government service and entering into public sector\nhad taken the advantage of commuting the entire pension.\nThey certainly belong to a class different from those whose\ncase was before this Court at the instance of the common\ncause in Writ Petition Nos. 1955-61 of 1983. It was further\nheld \nin \nthe above case\n that the commutation does bring\ncertain advantages to the committees and the class of\nGovernment officers whom the petitioner seeks to\nrepresent have derived such benefits.'\n We find no reason to take a different view. The\ncommutation brings about certain advantages. The\ncommuting pensioner gets a lumpsum amount which\nordinarily he would have received in the course of his\nspread over period subject to his continuing to live. Thus,\ntwo advantages are certainly forthcoming out of\ncommutation-(1) availability of a lumpsum amount, and (2)\nthe risk factor. In the present case the petitioners had\nnot only got 1/3rd of their pension commuted but exercised\nthe option of getting the entire pension commuted and in\nlieu thereof got a lumpsum. Such persons cannot fall in\n\n 363\n\nthe category of Central Government pensioners for the\npurposes of getting benefit of Liberalised Pension Rules\nwhich can be made applicable only to Central Government\nPensioners. It is no doubt correct that the family pension\nhas been allowed in case of the persons like the petitioners\nbut that does not make them entitled to get any benefit\ngiven to the pensioners on account of the liberalised\nPension Rules taking note of the fallen value of the rupee.\n\n It was contended by Mr. Rao on behalf of the\npetitioners that the petitioners are not claiming any\npension but their contention is that the Liberalised Pension\nRules which given benefit to those pensioners who had got\ntheir 1/3rd pension commuted should be granted to the\npetitioners by awarding lumpsum after increasing their\npension and calculating such amount in proportion to the\nincreased pension. We find no force in this contention as\nthe petitioners fall in a different class altogether and are\nnot entitled to claim any benefit granted to Central\nGovernment pensioners. After getting a lumpsum in lieu\nof entire pension, they do not fall in the class of Central\nGovernment pensioners and are not entitled to any benefit\ngranted to Central Government pensioners. The case of\nsuch Central Government pensioners who got their 1/3rd\npension commuted also fall in a different class in as much\nas they get 2/3rd pension, and after 15 years of such\ncommutation or having attained the age of 70 years whichever\nwas later they become entitled to full pension. Petitioners\non the other hand were not entitled to any pension after\nhaving received the lumpsum amount in lieu of pension being\ncommuted and having opted to receive such amount in lumpsum\nat the time of entering the service in Public, Sector\nUndertaking.\n\n In the above mentioned civil appeal the legal question\nis identical except that the appellant in this case became a\npensioner of the Central Government w.e.f. 1.4.1977 and the\npension determined as payable to him was Rs.609 per month\nand the same was got commuted by the appellant for a lumpsum\namount on and from 7.8.1978. The appellant had exercised the\noption for absorption in Steel Authority of India Limited\n(SAIL) a Public Sector Enterprise. The Writ Petition filed\nby him before the High Court of Delhi was dismissed on\n25.8.1982. The appellant then filed a S.L.P. against the\nsaid order. This Court had granted special leave on\n25.3.1985 and had given a direction to hear the appeal\nalongwith the writ petition Nos. 11757 & 11758 of 1984.\n\n In the result we find no force in all these cases and\nthe same are dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\nR.P. Petitions and Appeal\n dismissed.\n\n 364",
