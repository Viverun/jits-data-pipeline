As a result, a large number of ad hoc\nemployees were continuing for several years without being\nregularised and were agitating for their regularisation. To\nmeet the situation, both the appellant Governments issued\norders from time to time for regularisation of such\nemployees subject to certain conditions.\n In pursuance of these orders a number of persons, who\nsatisfied the conditions prescribed in each of those order s\nwere regularised, but many could not be, for the reason that\nthey did not satisfy one or the other of the conditions\nprescribed in the said orders. They were, however, allowed\nto continue in service. This category of people approached\nthe High Court praying for issuance of writ, order or\ndirection for regularisation of their service. They\ncontended that the conditions in the said orders were\narbitrary, discriminatory and unrelated to the object.\n The work-charged employees, daily-wagers, casual labour\nand those\n 827\nemployed in temporary/time-bound projects also approached\nthe High Court for regularisation of their services. Some\nof the petitioners also pleaded for equal pay for equal\nwork.\n Accepting the pleas of the petitioners, the High Court\ngave certain directions to the appellant-States for\nregularisation of these employees.\n Aggrieved by the High Court's orders, the two appellant\nStates filed appeals before this Court. Some of the\nemployees also filed Writ Petitions before this Court\ndirectly, contending that they too were governed by the\ndirections given by the High Court and that they should be\ngiven the benefit of the same.\n On behalf of the appellants the validity and\ncorrectness of the directions given by the High Court were\nquestioned on the grounds that the High Court had exceeded\nits jurisdiction in virtually amending the Government orders\nand was not justified in holding that the fixation of a\nparticular date in the respective Government orders was\narbitrary and/or that it was unrelated to the object sought\nto be achieved; that the High Court also erred in holding\nthat the requirement of having been sponsored by the\nEmployment Exchange was invalid; that the High Court was not\njustified in directing that all persons who had put in one\nyear's service should be regularised unconditionally; and\nthat such a direction would given rise to several\ndifficulties and complications for the administration, that\nthere could be a direction for regularisation, without a\npost or a vacancy and the Government could not be directed\nto create posts without number, and it was beyond the\ncapacity of any Government to comply with such directions;\nthat the direction with respect to work-charged\nestablishment, casual labour and daily wagers equally\nunsustainable in law; that the rule prescribing minimum\nqualifying service of one year in one State could not be\nthrust upon the other State; that because of the directions\nin question, while regularly selected persons would be kept\nout of jobs, unqualified ineligible persons who had come\nthrough back door and whose records of service might also\nnot be satisfactory would be regularised at one go and the\nrule of reservation would also be violated and that it was\nthe prerogative of the Executive to create and abolish\nposts, and that the Government could not be compelled to\ncreate posts where there was no need for such posts or where\nthe need is no longer there.\n 828\n It was contended on behalf of the respondents and the\nwrit petitioners that the directions had been given with a\nview to curb the arbitrariness of the authorities and with a\nview to give a satisfactory solution to a human problem\ncreated by the policies of the Governments themselves, that\nthe work-charged employees should be treated on par with ad-\nhoc employees and ought to be regularised on the 1st of\nApril of each year, and all those persons who where working\nin the permanent posts ought to be regularised.\n Disposing of the cases, this Court,\n HELD : 1.1. Ordinarily speaking, the creation and\nabolition of a post is the prerogative of the Executive. It\nis the Executive again that lays down the conditions of\nservice subject, of course, to a law made by the appropriate\nlegislature. This power to prescribe the conditions of\nservice can be exercised either by making Rules under the\nproviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution or (in the\nabsence of such Rules) by issuing Rules/Instructions in\nexercise of its executive power. The court comes into the\npicture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights,\nstatutory provisions, Rules and other instructions, if any,\ngoverning the conditions of service. The main concern of\nthe court in such matters is to ensure the Rule of law and\nto see that the executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal\nto its employees consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16.\n It also means that the State should not\nexploit its employees nor should it seek to take advantage\nof the helplessness and misery of either the unemployed\npersons or the employees, as the case may be. [847 F-H]\n 1.2. The State must be a model employer. It is for this\nreason it is held that equal pay must be given for equal\nwork, which is indeed one of the directive principles of the\nConstitution and that a person should not be kept in a\ntemporary or ad hoc status for long. [848A]\n 1.3. Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment is\ncontinued for long, the court presumes that there is need\nand warrant for a regular post and accordingly directs\nregularisation. While all the situations in which the court\nmay act to ensure fairness cannot be detailed, it is\nsufficient to indicate that the guiding principles are the\nones indicated above. [848B]\n Dharwad Distt. P.W.D. Literature Daily Wage Employees'\nAssociation v. State of Karnataka and Ors., [1990] 2 S.C.C.\n396 and Jacob v. Kerala\n 829\nWater Authority, [1990] Suppl. 1 S.C.R. 562, referred to.\n 2.1. The court must, while giving directions, act with\ndue care and caution. It must first ascertain the relevant\nfacts, and must be cognizant of the several situations and\neventualities that may arise on account of such directions.\nA practical and pragmatic view has to be taken, inasmuch as\nevery such direction not only tells upon the public\nexchequer but also has the effect of increasing the cadre\nstrength of a particular service, class or category.\n[852A,B]\n 2.2. In the instant case apart from the fact that the\nHigh Court was not right in holding that the several\nconditions imposed by the two Governments in their\nrespective orders relating to regularisation were arbitrary,\nnot valid and justified, it acted rather hastily in\ndirecting wholesome regularisation of all such persons who\nhave put in one year's service, and that too\nunconditionally. Several problems will arise if such\ndirections become the norm. Therefore, there is need for\nfulled consideration and due circumspection while giving\nsuch directions. [852C]\n 3.1. The Government orders in question were issued by\nthe Government from time to time. These orders are not in\nthe nature of a statute which is applicable to all existing\nand future situations. They were issued to meet a given\nsituation facing the Government at a given point of time. In\nthe circumstances, therefore, there was nothing wrong in\nprescribing a particular date by which the specified period\nof service (whether it is one year or two years) ought to\nhave been put in. [853G]\n 3.2. The first order dated 1st January, 1980 issued by\none of the States says, a person must have completed two\nyears of service as on 31st December, 1979, i.e., the day\nprevious to the issuance of the order. It cannot be said\nthat fixing of such a date is arbitrary and unreasonable.\nSimilarly, the order dated 3rd January, 1983 fixes 15th\nSeptember, 1982 as the relevant date. This\nnotification/order does two things. Firstly, it excludes\nClass III posts of clerks from the purview of the S.S.S.B.\nin case of those who have completed a minimum of two years\nof service as on 15th September, 1982, and secondly, it\nprovides for their regularisation subject to certain\nconditions. No particular attack was made as to this date\nin the High Court. Consequently, the Government had no\nopportunity of explaining as to why this particular date was\nfixed. Without giving such an opportunity it cannot be held\nthat the fixation of the said date is arbitrary.\n 830\nWhat is more relevant is that the High Court has not held\nthat this particular date is arbitrary. According to it,\nfixation of any date whatsoever was arbitrary, because, in\nits opinion, the order must say that any and every person\nwho completes the prescribed period of service must be\nregularised on completion of such period of service. The\nnext order dated 24th March, 1987 prescribes the date as\n31.12.1986. i.e., the end of the previous year. In the\ncircumstances, there is no basis for holding that fixation\nof the date can be held to be arbitrary in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. [854A-D]\n Dr. Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, [1985] S.C.\n1367 and Inder Pal Yadav & Ors. etc. v. Union of India &\nOrs. etc., [1985] 3 S.C.R. 837, referred to.\n 3.3. The Government orders say that all those who had\nbeen sponsored by Employment Exchange or had been appointed\nafter issuing a public advertisement alone be regularised.\nThere is no unreasonableness or invalidity in the same. It\nis a reasonable and wholesome provision and a requirement\ndesigned to curb and discourage back door entry and\nirregular appointments and ought not to have been\ninvalidated. Moreover, these are not cases where the writ\npetitioners were appointed only after obtaining a non-\navailability certificate from the Employment Exchange.\n[855E-F]\n Union of India v. Hargopal, 1987 S.C. 1227, referred to.\n 3.4. The further requirement prescribed in the orders,\nviz., that the employees must have possessed the prescribed\nqualifications for the post at the time of his appointment\non ad hoc basis is equally a valid condition. [855G-H]\n 3.5. The High Court was not justified in holding that\ninasmuch as the two States were sister States and because\nprior to 1966 one State was a part of the other State, the\nrule relating to length of service requisite for\nregularisation should be uniform in both the States. They\nare two different States having their own Governments;\nmerely because one Government chooses to say that one year's\ntemporary ad hoc service is enough for regularisation it\ncannot be said that the other State must also prescribe the\nvery same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or\nshorter period. The fact that there is a single High Court\nfor both the States and\n 831\nthe Union Territory of Chandigarh is no ground for saying\nthat the orders issued by them should be uniform. [856A-C]\n 3.6. It is not necessary to alter or modify the\ndirections of the High Court, in so far as one of the States\nwas concerned, that Class III and IV posts which were within\nthe purview of the S.S.S.B. should equally be within the\npurview of regularisation orders issued by it. If any of the\npetitioners have been excluded from consideration (for\nregularisation) on the basis that most of the Class III and\nIV posts were kept out of the purview of the S.S.S.B. they\nmay be considered and appropriate orders passed. [856D-E]\n 3.7. The High Court was also not justified in giving the\ndirection that all those ad hoc/temporary employees who had\ncontinued for more than one year should be regularised. The\ndirection has been given without reference to the existence\nof a vacancy. It, in effect, means that every ad\nhoc/temporary employee who has been continued for one year\nshould be regularised even though (a) no vacancy is\navailable for him - which means creation of a vacancy (b) he\nwas not sponsored by the Employment Exchange nor was he\nappointed in pursuance of a notification calling for\napplications which means he had entered by a back-door (c)\nhe was not eligible and/or qualified for the post at the\ntime of his appointment and (d) his record of service since\nhis appointment is not satisfactory. Moreover, from the\nmere continuation of an ad hoc employee for one year, it\ncannot be presumed that there is need for a regular post.\nSuch a presumption may be justified only when such\ncontinuance extends to several years. Further, there can be\nno `rule of thumb' in such matters. Conditions and\ncircumstances of one unit may not be the same as of the\nother. Just because in one case, a direction was given to\nregularise employees who have put in one year's service as\nfar as possible and subject to fulfilling the\nqualifications, it cannot be held that in each and every\ncase such a direction must follow irrespective of and\nwithout taking into account the other relevant circumstances\nand considerations. The relief must be moulded in each case\nhaving regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances of\nthat case. It cannot be a mechanical act but a judicious\none. Judged from this stand point, the directions under\nchallenge must be held to be totally untenable and\nunsustainable. [856F-H; 857A-C]\n3.8. So far as the members of the work-charged establishment\nare\n 832\nconcerned, though the work-charged employees are denied\ncertain benefits, they are industrial workers and are\nentitled to the benefits of the provisions contained in the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n. Their rights flow from that special\nenactment under which even contracts of employment are open\nto adjustment and modification. The work-charged employees,\ntherefore, are in a better position than temporary servants\nlike the other petitioners who are liable to be thrown out\nof employment without any kind of compensatory benefits.\n[857D, 858A-B]\n Jaswant Singh v. Union of India, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 426,\nreferred to.\n 3.9. In view of the orders issued on 24th March, 1987\nand 6th April, 1990 by one of the States, the direction\ngiven by the High Court becomes unnecessary. Though no\norders have been issued in this regard by the other States,\na scheme of regularisation of these employees is stated to\nhave been prepared by that State in pursuance of the\njudgment under challenge. The said scheme is, however, not\nmade conditional upon the result of these appeals against\nthe judgment. The scheme is a reasonably fair one. It is\nhoped and trusted that irrespective of the result of these\nappeals, the said scheme would be given effect to by the\nother State concerned.[858C-D]\n 3.10. The High Court has directed that all those\nemployees who fell within the definition of `workmen'\ncontained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n would also be\nentitled to regularisation on par with the work-charged\nemployees and that they should be regularised on completing\nfive years of service in one State and four years of\nservice in the other State. This direction is given in\nfavour of those casual labour and daily wagers who fall\nwithin the definition of workmen. Insofar as work-charged\nemployees, daily-wage workers and casual labourers who did\nnot fall within the definition of work-men are concerned,\nthe High Court has directed their regularisation on\ncompletion of one year's service. This direction is as\nuntenable as in the case of ad hoc/temporary employees. The\ndirection regarding persons belonging to the above\ncategories and who fall within the definition of workmen,\nthe terms in which the direction has been given cannot be\nsustained. While it is true that persons belonging to these\ncategories continuing over a number of years have a right to\nclaim regularisation and the authorities are under an\nobligation to consider their case for regularisation in a\nfair manner, keeping in view the prin-\n 833\nciples enunciated by this Court, the blanket direction given\ncannot be sustained. However, in view of the orders of one\nof the State Governments contained in the letter dated\n6.4.1990 which provided for regularisation of these persons\non completion of ten years, no further directions are called\nfor at this stage. The other State Government, of course,\nhas not issued any such orders governing these categories.\nAccordingly, the State Government concerned should verify\nthe vacancy position in the categories of daily-wagers and\ncasual labour and frame a scheme of absorption in a fair and\njust manner providing for regularisation of these persons,\nhaving regard to their length of service and other relevant\nconditions. As many persons as possible shall be absorbed.\nThe scheme should be framed within six months. [858F-H; 859\nA-C]\n 4. Further orders had been issued by one of the State\nGovernments, after the filing of the writ petitions and\nduring the pendency of the Special Leave Petitions in this\nCourt for regularisation of ad hoc/work-charged employees.\nThe other State Government has agreed by an affidavit before\nthis Court, to adopt the same mutatis mutandis so far as\nClass III employees are concerned. It is hoped that many of\nthe employees would get regularised under the orders\naforementioned issued by both the Governments. [859D, 865F,\n867E]\n 5.1. The instant case is not a case where the\nGovernments have failed to take any steps for regularisation\nof their ad hoc employees working over the years. Every few\nyears they have been issuing orders providing for\nregularisation. In such a case, there is no occasion for the\ncourt to issue any directions for regularising such\nemployees more particularly when none of the conditions\nprescribed in the said orders can be said to be either\nunreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The court cannot\nobviously help those who cannot get regularised under these\norders for their failure to satisfy the conditions\nprescribed therein. Issuing general declaration of\nindulgence is no part of jurisdiction of this Court. In case\nof such persons it is for the respective Governments to\nconsider the feasibility of giving them appropriate relief,\nparticularly in case where persons have been continuing over\na long number of years, and were eligible and qualified on\nthe date of their ad hoc appointment and further whose\nrecord of service is satisfactory. [867 F-H]\n 5.2. The normal rule, is regular recruitment through the\nprescribed\n 834\nagency but exigencies of administration may sometimes call\nfor an ad hoc or temporary appointment to be made. In such a\nsituation, effort should always be to replace such an ad\nhoc/temporary employee by a regularly selected employee as\nearly as possible. Such a temporary employee may also\ncompete along with others for such regular\nselection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good,\nbut if he does not, he must give way to the regularly\nselected candidate. The appointment of the regularly\nselected candidate. The appointment of the regularly\nselected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance\nfor the sake of such an ad hoc/temporary employee. Secondly,\nan ad hoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by\nanother ad hoc or temporary employee; he must be replaced\nonly by a regularly selected employee. This is necessary to\navoid arbitrary action on the part of the appointing\nauthority. Thirdly, even where an ad hoc or temporary\nemployment is necessitated on account of the exigencies of\nadministration, he should ordinarily be drawn from the\nemployment exchange unless it cannot brook delay in which\ncase the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no\ncandidate is available or is not sponsored by the employment\nexchange, some appropriate method consistent with the\nrequirements of \nArticle 16\n should be followed. In other\nwords, there must be a notice published in the appropriate\nmanner calling for applications and all those who apply in\nresponse thereto should be considered fairly. An unqualified\nperson ought to be appointed only when qualified persons are\nnot available through the above processes. If for any\nreason an ad hoc or temporary employee is continued for a\nfairly long spell, the authorities must consider his case\nfor regularisation provide he is eligible and qualified\naccording to rules and his service record is satisfactory\nand his appointment does not run counter to the reservation\npolicy of the State. [868D-H; 869A-C]\n 5.3. The proper course would be that each State prepares\na scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation\nof such employees consistent with its reservation policy and\nif a scheme is already framed, the same may be made\nconsistent with the observations herein so as to reduce\navoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person\nis regularised he should be placed immediately below the\nlast regularly appointed employee in that category, class or\nservice, as the case may be. [869D]\n 5.4. So far as the work-charged employees and casual\nlabour are concerned, the effort must be to regularise them\nas far as possible and as\n 835\nearly as possible subject to their fulfilling the\nqualification, if any, prescribed for the post and subject\nalso to availability of work. If a casual labourer is\ncontinued for a fairly long spell - say two or three years -\na presumption may arise that there is regular need for his\nservices. In such a situation it becomes obligatory for the\nconcerned authority to examine the feasibility of his\nregularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought to\nadopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the\nperson. Security of tenure is necessary for an employee to\ngive his best to the job. In this behalf, this Court\ncommends the orders of one of the State Governments,\ncontained in its letter dated 6.4.1990 both in relation to\nwork-charged employees as well as casual labour. [869 E-G]\n 5.5. The orders issued by both the Governments providing\nfor regularisation of ad hoc/temporary employees who have\nput in two years/one year of service are quite generous and\nleave no room for any legitimate grievance by any one.\n[869H]\n 5.6. These observations are not exhaustive nor can they\nbe understood as immutable. Each Government or authority has\nto devise its own criteria or principles for regularisation\nhaving regard to all the relevant circumstances, but while\ndoing so, it should bear in mind the observations made\nherein. [870 A-B]\n 6.1. So far as the employees and workmen employed by\nStatutory/Public Corporations are concerned, they have not\nissued any orders akin to those issued by the two State\nGovernments. Even so, it is but appropriate that they adopt\nas far as possible, keeping the exigencies and requirements\nof their administration in view, the criteria and principles\nunderlying the orders issued by their Government in the\nmatter of regularisation and pass appropriate orders. The\norders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990, as\nsupplemented by the orders in the Notification dated\n28.2.1991 issued by one of the States should be followed by\nthe Statutory/Public Corporations located in that State,\nwhereas the Statutory/Public Corporations located in the\nother State should follow the criteria and principles stated\nin the affidavit of the Government of that State filed\nbefore this Court. [870 C-D]\n 6.2. These directions would not, however, apply to these\nStatutory/Public Corporations, functioning within these\nStates as are under the control of the Government of India.\nThese Corporations would evolve an\n 836\nappropriate policy of regularisation in the light of this\njudgment, if they have not already evolved one, or make\ntheir existing policy consistent with the judgment to avoid\nlitigation. [870E]\n 7. As regards, equal pay for equal work, the judgment is\nsingularly devoid of discussion. The direction given by the\nHigh Court is totally vague. It does not make it clear who\nwill get what pay and on what basis. Hence, this direction\nis set aside.\n Delhi Development Horticulture Employees' Union v.

State of Haryana and\nOrs.\n). A large number of writ petitions arising both the\nStates of Punjab and Haryana were heard together and a\ncommon judgment delivered giving certain directions in the\nmatter of regularisation of the adhoc/temporary employees,\nmembers of work charged establishments, daily-wagers, casual\nlabour and those engaged temporarily in temporary schemes.\nWe have heard all the counsel appearing in this batch at\nquite some length.\n\n Leave granted in all the Special Leave Petitions.\n\n 2. Over the last several years a large number of\nappointments were made to Class III and IV services in the\nStates of Punjab and Haryana on ad hoc basis i.e., without\nreference to Public Service Commission or the Subordinate\nServices Selection Board and without adhering to employment\nexchange requirements. They were initially appointed for a\nperiod of six months or so but were continued for years\ntogether under orders passed from time to time. (In so far\nas the State of Haryana is concerned, most of the class III\nposts in the Education Department were kept out of the\npurview of the S.S.S.B. during the period 1970 to 1987. For\na period of 10 years, it is stated, there was no Board in\nexistence in the State. Only in March 1987, almost all the\nposts in Education Department and other Departments were\nbrought within the purview of the S.S.S.B.). As a result of\nthe above policy, a large number of ad hoc employees came\ninto existence in both the States, who were continuing over\nseveral years without being regularised and were agitating\nfor their regularisation. To meet the situation, both the\nGovernments issued orders from time to time for\nregularisation of such employees subject to certain\nconditions. The orders issued by the Government of Punjab\nare the following:\n\n 838\n\nS.No. Date of issue Substance of the Order\n 1 2 3\n\n 1. 3.3.1969 Regularisation of ad hoc\n employees completing one\n year service on 28.2.1969.\n\n 2. 29.1.1973 Regularisation of ad hoc\n employees completing one\n year service on 1.1.1973.\n\n 3. 3.5.1977 Regularisation of ad hoc\n employees completing one\n year service on 1.4.1977.\n\n 4. 20.10.1980 Regularisation of ad hoc\n employees completing one\n year service on\n 1.10.1980.\n\n 5. 20.10.1982 Regularisation of ad hoc\n employees completing one\n year service on\n 26.10.1982.\n\n 6. 29.3.1985 Regularisation of ad hoc\n employees completing two\n years service on\n 1.4.1985.\n\n 7. 8.8.1985 Modifying the order issued\n on 29.3.1985 and\n directing that all Class\n III ad hoc employees having\n one year service on\n 1.4.1985 may be\n regularised.\n\n 8. 1.9.1986 Regularisation of Class\n III ad hoc employees\n appointed after 1.4.1984.\n\n The orders are issued by the Government of Haryana are\nthe following:\n\nS.No. Date of issue Substance of Order\n 1 2 3\n 1 1.1.1980 Regularisation of all Class\n III ad hoc employees who\n have completed two years\n service on 31.3.1979.\n 2. 3.1.1983 Regularisation of ad hoc\n Clerks in Class III who\n have completed two years\n service on 15.9.1982.\n 3. 19.1.1984 Regularisation of Class\n III ad hoc employees who\n have completed two years\n of service on 15.9.1982.\n (The employees who were\n left out in the orders\n dt. 3.1.1983 were brought\n within the purview of\n this order.)\n\n 839\n\n 4. 15.2.1987 Regularisation of all\n Class III ad hoc\n employees other than\n teachers working against\n posts which have been\n taken out of the\n purview of the S.S.S.B.\n and who have completed\n two years service on\n 1.11.1986.\n\n In pursuance of the above orders a number of persons who\nsatisfied the conditions prescribed in each of those orders\nwere regularised but many could not be. Their services could\nnot be regularised for the reason that they did not satisfy\none or the other of the conditions prescribed in the said\norders. They were, however, allowed to continue in service.\nIt is this category of people who approached the High Court\nof Punjab and Haryana praying for issuance of Writ, Order of\nDirection for regularisation of their service.\n\n 3. At this stage, it would be appropriate to notice the\nconditions prescribed by the aforesaid orders which were not\nsatisfied by the writ petitioners and on account of which\nthey were not regularised. The order of the Government of\nHaryana dated 1st January, 1980 prescribed the following\nconditions for regularisation:\n\n (1) He must have put in a minimum service to two years\non 31.12.1979.\n\n (2) He must have been recruited through the Employment\nExchange.\n\n (3) The service and conduct of such employee should be\nof an overall good category.\n\n (4) He must have possessed the prescribed qualifications\nfor the post at the time of his appointment on ad hoc basis.\n\n In the Order dated 3rd January 1983, a further\ncondition, besides the aforesaid conditions, was imposed\nviz., that the employee must belong to the category for\nwhich the post stands reserved.\n\n Similarly in the Order dated 29th March, 1985 issued in\nthe case of Government of Punjab (issued by the President of\nIndia) the conditions prescribed were the following:\n\n (1) He must have completed a minimum of two years\nservice on 1st\n\n 840\n\nApril, 1985.\n\n (2) He must have fulfilled the conditions for\neligibility (academic qualifications, experience and age) at\nthe time of his first adhoc/temporary appointment.\n (3) He must have been recruited through the Employment\nExchange or by open advertisement.\n (4) His record of service has been satisfactory.\n (5) He is found medically fit for entering the\nGovernment service; his character and antecedent have been\nduly verified and found suitable for Government service.\n (6) A regular post/vacancy is available for\nregularisation.\n\n (7) He has been found fit for regularisation by the\nDepartmental Selection Committee.\n (8) Among the persons regularised, interse seniority\nwould be observed. All these persons would be placed junior\nto those working on regular basis.\n\n These are the conditions common to all the orders issued\nfrom time to time by the Government of Punjab and Haryana.\nOnly those ad hoc/temporary employees who could not be\nregularised for want of satisfying one or the other of the\nconditions prescribed in the respective orders that had\napproached the High Court by way of Writ Petitions. They\ncontended that the conditions prescribed in the said orders\nwere arbitrary, discriminatory and unrelated to the object.\nIt is this contention which was examined at some length and\naccepted by the high court.\n\n 4. Besides the ad hoc/temporary employees, certain other\ncategories of persons also approached the High Court whose\ncases too have been dealt with in the judgment under appeal.\nThey are work-charged employees daily-wagers, casual labour\nand those employed in temporary/time-bound projects. They\ntoo wanted to be regularised. A plea of equal pay for equal\nwork was also advanced by certain petitioners. These pleas\ntoo were considered and upheld.\n\n 841\n\n 5. The reasons for which the High Court held the\nconditions prescribed in the orders of regularisation\naforementioned, as bad are to the following effect:\n\n (a) VALIDITY OF FIXING A PARTICULAR DATE BY WHICH THE\nSPECIFIED PERIOD OF SERVICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.\n\n The High Court held, \"there is no magic in fixing a date\nby which an employee was to complete the prescribed tenure\nof service for regularisation.......fixing of a date has no\nreasonable basis or intelligible differentia for the object\nto achieve......following that view (the view taken by this\nCourt in Inder Pal Yadav, [1985] 3 S.C.R. 837) we hold that\nthe dates fixed for the policies of regularisation of the\ntwo Governments are discriminatory.......we hold that the\nvarious dates fixed from time to time in their\nregularisation policies are hit by \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution of India.\"\n\n (b) VALIDITY OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD\nHAVE BEEN SPONSORED BY EMPLOYMENT EXCHANGE.\n\n \nThe High Court held that this Court has, in the \nUnion\nof India v. Hargopal\n (1987 S.C. 1227), held that \"if at a\ngiven moment suitable candidates amongst candidates\nsponsored by the Employment Exchanges are not available or\nno candidate has been sponsored by the Employment Exchange\nand recruitment is made on ad hoc basis from the sources\nother than employment exchange, it cannot be said in\nregularisation policy that such candidates would not be\nentitled to be regularised. The basic policy decision is\nthat ad hoc employees who have worked for quite some time\nand have gained experience should be regularised and in case\nthey are shunted out, hardship would be caused in numerous\nways.......we find no justification in the policy of\nregularisation that the candidates sponsored through the\nEmployment Exchanges alone would be entitled to\nregularisation.\"\n No finding was, however, recorded that the\npetitioners or any of them were appointed without reference\nto the Employment Exchange only after the Employment\nExchange intimated the concerned authority that no suitable\ncandidate is available with it.\n\n (c) VALIDITY OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CON-\n\n 842\n\nCERNED POSTS SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF S.S.S.B.\n The High Court held that inasmuch as most of the Class\nIII and Class IV posts were kept out of the purview of the\nS.S.S.B. in the State of Haryana during the period 1970 to\nMarch, 1987 and also because for a period of ten years there\nwas no S.S.S.B. in existence in this State, imposition of\nthis condition by the Government of Haryana is unreasonable\nand arbitrary.\n\n 6. Having expressed the opinions above-mentioned, the\nHigh Court referred to certain decisions of this Court and\nof its own, and expressed the view that continuing employees\non adhoc basis for more than one year without regularising\nthem is arbitrary and unreasonable. This principle was also\nheld applicable to other categories of employees like daily\nwagers, casual labour and others, who were - \"workmen\" as\ndefined in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n. The court further\nopined that inasmuch as the State of Haryana was\nprescribing one year's service for regularisation (in its\norders) the Punjab Government cannot prescribe two years\nqualifying service. Thus, one year service was declared as\nthe norm for all such employees to become entitled to\nregularisation.\n\n 7. The directions ultimately granted by the High Court\nwhile allowing the batch of writ petitions are to the\nfollowing effect:\n\n (1) The State Government should avoid making any ad\n hoc appointments. If they do so, it shall be for\n initial period of six months and not be extended\n beyond other six months. If their term is extended\n beyond one year, to such employees the benefits\n arising from our following conclusions will apply,\n according to the group in which they fall.\n (2) The Punjab State employees covered by Group\n No. 1 would be considered as regular members of the\n service on completion of more than one year after\n ignoring national and permissible breaks in\n service, as noticed by the Supreme Court in various\n judgments and also by our Full Banch in Jagdish\n Lal's case (supra). However, the concerned\n departments would pass orders for their\n regularisation and they would be entitled to all\n benefits of service from the date of their initial\n appointments.\n\n 843\n\n As regards Haryana employees covered by Group No. 1\n on completion of two years of service they would be\n considered as regular members of service after\n ignoring their national and permissible breaks as\n noticed by the Supreme Court in various judgments\n and also by our Full Bench in Jagdish Lal's case\n (supra), and the concerned departments would pass\n orders for their regularisation. In case of those,\n who have completed more than one year of service,\n their services shall not be terminated till the new\n policy for regularisation in accordance with our\n judgment, is framed, in which a direction has been\n issued to re-frame the policy for regularisation on\n completion of more than one year of service, and\n without the condition which may hamper the policy\n of regularisation, irrespective of the fact whether\n or not their names were sponsored by the\n Employment Exchange or that their posts are within\n or outside the purview of the S.S.S.B. In case such\n petitioners complete two years, then on completion\n of two years, they will be considered as regular\n members of service and appropriate orders for their\n regularisation will be passed by the concerned\n departments, and such employees would be entitled\n to all service benefits from the date of their\n initial appointments.\n\n (3) The services of work charged, daily wage\n workers and casual labourers (other than those who\n fall within the definition of workmen under the\n 1947 act covered by Group III) Serving in the\n different departments of Government of Punjab and\n Haryana, as also their corporations who have put in\n more than one year of service, would continue to\n serve and their services will not be dispensed\n with. The concerned departments shall frame scheme\n for their absorption, as regular employees on\n completion of more than one year of service, and\n their services shall be regularised under those\n schemes. On regularisation they would be entitled\n to all service benefits from the date of initial\n appointments.\n\n As regards work charged employees, who have\n completed five years of service, they shall be\n considered to be regular employees under the scheme\n of regularisation framed by the State of Punjab and\n order for their regularisation shall be\n\n 844\n\n passed. As regards work charged employees of the\n State of Haryana, on completion of four years of\n service they shall be considered to be regular\n under the regularisation scheme framed by the State\n and appropriate orders for their regularisation\n shall be passed. However, they would be entitled to\n all service benefits from the date of initial\n appointments.\n\n \n(4) The persons falling in group (III) are those\n who come within the definition of `workmen' under\n the 1947 Act. On completion of 240 days, which\n shall be counted keeping in view the decision of\n the Supreme Court in \nThe Workmen of American\n Express International Bank Corporation v. The\n Management of American Express, A.I.R.\n 1986 S.C.\n 458, they would be entitled to benefits of all the\n provisions of Chapter V-a of the 1947 Act, and\n their services should not be dispensed with without\n following the procedure laid in that Chapter. For\n the purposes of regularisation, what has been\n stated for the employees falling in Group II, would\n also be applicable to the employees falling in this\n group. On regularisation they would be entitled to\n the benefits of provisions of the 1947 Act as also\n the Service Rules, from the date of their initial\n appointments, as applicable to the departments\n concerned from time to time.\n\n (5) The ad hoc temporary employees in temporary\n organisations like the Adult Education Scheme and\n Integrated Child Development Scheme, covered by\n Group IV, who have continued in service for more\n than one year with national breaks would be\n entitled to the benefits of service and benefit of\n the directions issued by the Supreme Court in\n Bhagwan Dass's case supra, and the service of none\n of them would be terminated except on abandonment\n of the scheme.\n\n (6) In case services of an employee, who come\n within the ambit of Groups I to III, have already\n been terminated on the completion of his more than\n one year of service, he shall have to be taken back\n in service in case of a request being made by him\n to the concerned department of the government\n before the expiry of three years and two months of\n such termination.\n\n Some of the petitioners, who had put in more than\n one year of\n\n 845\n\n service are out. They would be reinstated forthwith\n with continuity of service and all benefits.\n (7) In case some posts are abolished or some\n persons are found surplus, junior most would be out\n on the rule of Last come first go? But if later on\n vacancies arise or posts are created, they will\n have to be called back first in the order of\n seniority, that is, on the rule of last go first\n come and if still some vacancies remain, new\n incumbents through S.S.S.B. may be accommodated.\n (8) The learned counsel for the State was asked to\n point out if the claim made by the petitioners for\n equal pay for equal work as being paid to their\n counterparts, in view of the decision taken by the\n Supreme Court in various cases, was not justified.\n He was not able to point out if the claim so made\n was not correct. Accordingly, they would be paid\n wages as claimed from the date of initial\n appointments in service. The arrears should be paid\n within six months from today.\n\n It is again made clear that till regularisation\n policies are framed as directed by us and\n regularisation orders are passed, the employees\n shall continue and their services shall not be\n terminated.\"\n\n 8. The States of Punjab and Haryana are questioning the\nvalidity and correctness of the above directions in these\nappeals. Some employees have also directly approached this\ncourt by way of writ petitions contending that they too are\ngoverned by the directions given by the High Court and\nshould be given the benefit of the same. The respondents in\nthese appeals and such writ petitioners are supporting the\njudgment and directions aforesaid.\n\n Mr. Sibal, learned counsel for the appellants questioned\nthe validity and correctness of the directions given by the\nHigh Court on the following grounds:\n\n (1) That the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction in\nvirtually amending the Government orders on the subject of\nregularisation. The learned Judges were not justified in\nholding that the fixation of a particular date in the\nrespective G.Os. was arbitrary and/or that it was un-related\nto\n\n 846\n\nthe object. The learned Judges have also erred in holding\nthat the requirement of have been sponsored by the\nemployment Exchange was invalid.\n\n (2) The learned Judges were not justified in law in\ndirecting that all persons who have put in one year's\nservice should be regularised unconditionally. No court has\ngone so far nor is there any warrant for giving such a\ndirection. Such a direction gives rise to several\ndifficulties and complications for the administration which\nwere evidently not taken into consideration by the learned\nJudges while giving the said directions.\n (3) For regularisation, the first pre-condition is that\nthere must be a vacancy, whether permanent or temporary.\n\nSuch a vacancy must either be existing or may be created but\nit must be there. There cannot be a direction for\nregularisation without a post or a vacancy and the\nGovernment cannot be directed to create posts without\nnumber. It is beyond the capacity of any Government in India\nto comply with such directions.\n\n (4) The direction with respect to work-charge\nestablishment is equally unsustainable in law. So is the\ndirection with respect to casual labour and daily wagers.\n (5) The learned Judges erred in directing the Government\nof Punjab to reduce the minimum qualifying service to one\nyear just because the Haryana Government has been\nprescribing only one year's qualifying service in its\norders. Both are independent States and the rule in one\nState cannot be thrust upon the other.\n\n (6) Because of the impugned directions, regularly\nselected persons are being kept out of jobs. The effect of\nthe impugned directions is that unqualified ineligible\npersons who have come through back door and whose records of\nservice may also not be satisfactory are all being\nregularised at one go. The rule of reservation is also being\nviolated by the said directions.\n\n (7) It is prerogative of the Executive to create and\nabolish posts. The Government cannot be compelled to create\nposts where there is no need for such posts or where the\nneed is no longer there.\n\n (8) The above contentions are supported and reiterated\nby the counsel appearing for the State of Punjab.\n\n 847\n\n 9. On the other hand, it is contended by the counsel for\nthe respondents and the counsel for the writ petitioners\nthat the directions given are perfectly warranted in all the\ncircumstances of the case and have been given following the\ndecisions of this court. It is submitted that the said\ndirections have been given with a view to curb the\narbitrariness of the authorities and with a view to give a\nsatisfactory solution to a human problem created by the\npolicies of the Governments themselves. It is submitted by\nShri R.K. Garg that the work-charged employees should be\ntreated on par with ad hoc employees and ought to be\nregularised on the 1st of April of each year. All those\npersons who are working in the permanent posts ought to be\nregularised, says the counsel. Shri M.K.Ramamurthy,\nappearing for the work charged employees contended that the\ngeneral concept as to work charge employees, viz., that the\nemployment is confined to a particular work or project is\nnot correct. He submitted that this is a legacy left behind\nby the British. He submitted that the work charge employees\nare employees of the work charge establishment and so long\nas once or the other work is there, they should be\ncontinued. Inasmuch as the Government, particularly at the\npresent stage of development, is never without a project or\nwork, these employees must also be regularised. Indeed,\naccording to the counsel the concept of work charge\nestablishment is a mere matter of accountancy. It is\ndistinct from project employment. It is really temporary\nemployment which in the nature of things must be treated as\nregular. Other counsel appearing for the respondents in the\nappeals and for the writ petitioners supported these\ncontentions.\n\n 10. Ordinarily speaking, the creation and abolition of a\npost is the prerogative of the Executive. It is the\nExecutive again that lays down the conditions of service\nsubject, of course, to a law made the appropriate\nlegislature. This power to prescribe the conditions service\ncan be exercised either by making Rules under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\n of the Constitution or (in the absence of such\nRules) by issuing Rules/instructions in exercise of its\nexecutive power. The court comes into the picture only to\nensure observance of fundamental rights, statutory\nprovisions, Rules and other instructions, if any, governing\nthe conditions of service. The main concern of the court in\nsuch matters is to ensure the Rule of law and to see that\nthe executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its\nemployees consistent with the requirements of \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16.\n It also means that the State should not exploit its\nemployees nor should it seek to take advantage of the\nhelplessness and misery of either the unemployed persons\n\n 848\n\nor the employees, as the case may be. As is often said, the\nState must be a model employer. It is for this reason, it is\nheld that equal pay must be given for equal work, which is\nindeed one of the directive principles of the Constitution.\nIt is for this very reason it is held that a person should\nnot be kept in a temporary or ad hoc status for long. Where\na temporary or ad hoc appointment is continued for long the\ncourt presumes that there is need and warrant for a regular\npost and accordingly directs regularisation. \nWhile all the\nsituations in which the court may act to ensure fairness\ncannot be detailed here, it is sufficient to indicate that\nthe guiding principles are the ones stated above. The\nprinciple relevant in this behalf are stated by this Court\nin several decisions, of which it would be sufficient to\nmention two decisions having a bearing upon the issue\ninvolved here. They are Dharwad Distt. \nP.W.D. Literature\nDaily Wage Employees Association v. State of Karnataka and\nOrs.\n [1990] 2 \nS.C.C. 396 and Jacob v Kerala Water Authority\n\nalleged that about 50,000 persons were being employed on\ndaily-rated or on monthly-rated basis over a period of 15 to\n20 years, without regularising them. It was contended that\nthe very fact that they are continued over such a long\nperiod is itself proof of the fact that there is regular\nneed for such employment. In that view of the matter,\nfollowing directions were given,after reviewing the earlier\ndecisions of this court elaborately.\n\n \"From amongst the casual and daily rated employees\n who have completed ten years of service by December\n 31, 1989, 18,600 shall immediately be regularised\n with effect from January 1, 1990 on the basis of\n seniority-cum-suitability.\n\n There shall be no examination but physical\n infirmity shall mainly be the test of suitability.\n The remaining monthly rated employees covered by\n the paragraph 1 who have completed ten years of\n service as on December 31, 1989 shall be\n regularised before December31,1990, in a phased\n manner on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability,\n suitability being understood in the same way as\n above.\n\n The balance of casual or daily rated employees who\n become entitled to absorption on the basis of\n completing ten years of service shall be\n absorbed/regularised in a phased manner on the same\n principle as above on or before December 31,1997.\n\n 849\n\n At the point of regularisation, credit shall be\n given for every unit of five years of service in\n excess of ten years and one additional increment in\n the time scale of pay shall be allowed by way of\n weightage.\n\n There was a direction that the claims on other\n heads would be considered at the time of final\n disposal. We have come to the conclusion that apart\n from these reliefs no other would be admissible.\"\n\n Having given the said direction, the Bench (Ranganath\nMisra, M.M.Punchhi and S.C.Agarwal, JJ.) made the following\nobservations:\n\n \"We are alive to the position that the scheme which\n we have finalised is not the ideal one but as we\n have already stated, it is the obligation of the\n court to individualise justice to suit a given\n situation in a set of facts that are placed before\n it. Under the scheme of the constitution the purse\n remains in the hands of the executive. The\n legislature of the State controls the Consolidated\n Fund out of which the expenditure to be incurred,\n in giving effect to the scheme, will have to be\n met. The flow into the Consolidated Fund depends\n upon the policy of taxation depending perhaps on\n the capacity of the payer. Therefore, unduly\n burdening the State for implementing the\n constitutional obligation forthwith would create\n problems which the State may not be able to stand.\n We have, Therefore, made our directions with\n judicious restraint with the hope and trust that\n both parties would appreciate and understand the\n situation. The instrumentality of the State must\n realise that it is charged with a big trust. The\n money that flows into the Consolidated Fund and\n constitutes the resources of the State comes from\n the people and the welfare expenditure that is\n mated out goes from the same Fund back to the\n people. May be that in every situation the same tax\n payer is not beneficiary. That is an incident of\n taxation and a necessary concomitant of living\n within a welfare society.\"\n\n 11. The second case (Jacob) arose from Kerala. Upon the\nestablishment of Kerala Water Authority under \nKerala Water\nSupply and Sewerage Act, 1986\n, all the functions of Public\nHealth Engineering Department were also transferred to the\nAuthority. All the employees of the said\n\n 850\n\n department were transferred to the Authority. After its\nconstitution, the Authority too recruited some persons. With\neffect from 30.7.1988, the Authority came within the purview\nof the Public Service Commission. The employees of the\nAuthority thus fell into four categories namely, (i) those\nwho were in the employment of PHED before the constitution\nof the Authority and were transferred to the Authority, (ii)\nthose whom the Authority employed between 1st April, 1984\nand 4th August, 1986, (iii) those who were appointed between\n4th August 1986 and 30th July 1988, and (iv) those who were\nappointed after 30th July, 1988. Rule 9 of the Kerala State\nand Subordinate Services Rules empowered the Government to\nappoint persons, in the case of an emergency, otherwise than\nin accordance with the Rules. Such appointment was to be\nvalid only for a limited time and such appointee was bound\nto be replaced by a regular appointee. At the same time,\nclause (e) of the Rule provided that persons so appointed\nmay be regularised provided they completed two years\ncontinuous service on 22.12.1973. Construing the said clause\nin the light of the constitutional philosophy, this court\nheld:\n\n \"Therefore, if we interpret Rule 9(a) (i)\n consistently with the spirit and philsophy of the\n Constitution, which it is permissible to do without\n doing violence to the said rule, it follows that\n employees who are serving on the establishment for\n long spells and have the requisite qualifications\n for the job, should not be thrown out but their\n services should be regularised as far as possible.\n Since workers belonging to this batch have worked\n on their posts for reasonably long spells they are\n entitled to regularisation in service.\"\n\n In the light of the said principle and in the light of\nthe principles emerging from the decisions of this court -\nwhich were elaborately discussed-the following directions\nwere given:\n\n \"(1) The Authority will with immediate effect\n regularise the services of all ex-PHED employees as\n per its Resolution of 30th January, 1987 without\n waiting for State Government approval.\n (2) The services of workers employed by the\n Authority between 1st April, 1984 and 4th August,\n 1986 will be regularised with immediate effect if\n they possess the requisite qualifications for the\n post prescribed on the date of appointment of the\n con-\n\n 851\n\n cerned worker.\n\n (3) The services of workers appointed after 4th\n August, 1984 and possessing the requisite\n qualifications should be regulated in accordance\n with Act 19 of 1970 provided they have put in\n continuous service of not less than one year,\n artificial breaks, if any, to be ignored. The\n Kerala Public Service Commission will take\n immediate steps to regularise their services as a\n separate block. In doing so the Kerala Public\n Service Commission will take the age bar as waived.\n (4) The Kerala Public Service Commission will\n consider the question of regularisation of the\n services of workers who possess the requisite\n qualifications but have put in less than one year's\n service, separately. In doing so the Kerala Public\n Service commission will take the age bar as waived.\n\n If they are found fit they will be placed on the\n list along with the newly recruited candidates in\n the order of their respective merits. The Kerala\n Public Service commission will be free to rearrange\n the list accordingly. Thereafter fresh appointments\n will issue depending on the total number of posts\n available. If the posts are inadequate, those\n presently in employment will make room for the\n selected candidates but their names will remain on\n the list and they will be entitled to appointment\n as and when their turn arrives in regular course.\n The list will enure for such period as is\n permissible under the extant rules.\n\n (5) The Authority will be at liberty to deal with\n the services of the workers who do not possess the\n requisite qualifications as it may consider\n appropriate in accordance with law.\n\n (6) Those workers whose services have been\n terminated in violation of this Court's order in\n respect of which Contempt Petition No. 156 of 1990\n is taken out shall be entitled to the benefit of\n this order as if they continue in service and the\n case of each worker will be governed by the clause\n applicable to him depending on the category to\n which he belongs and if he is found eligible for\n regularisation he will be restored to service and\n assigned his proper place.\"\n\n 852\n\n 12. As would be evident from the observations made and\ndirections given in the above two cases, the court must,\nwhile giving such directions, act with due care and caution.\nIt must first ascertain the relevant facts, and must be\ncognizant of the several situations and eventualities that\nmay arise on account of such directions. A practical and\npragmatic view has to be taken, inasmuch as every such\ndirection not only tells upon the public exchequer but also\nhas the effect of increasing the cadre strength of a\nparticular service, class or category. Now, take the\ndirections given in the judgment under appeal. Apart from\nthe fact the High Court was not right-as we shall presently\ndemonstrate in holding that the several conditions imposed\nby the two Governments in their respective order relating to\nregularisation are arbitrary not valid and justified - the\nhigh Court acted rather hastily in directing wholesome\nregularisation of all such persons who have put in one\nyear's service, and that too unconditionally. We may venture\nto point out the several problems that will arise if such\ndirections become the norm:\n\n (a) Take a case where certain vacancies are existing or\nexpected and steps are taken for regular recruitment either\nthrough Public Service Commission or other such body, as the\ncase may be. A large number of persons apply. Inevitably\nthere is bound to be some delay in finalising the selections\nand making the appointments. Very often the process of\nselection is stayed or has to be re-done for one or the\nother reason. Meanwhile the exigencies of administration may\nrequire appointment of temporary hands. It may happen that\nthese temporary hands are continued for more than one year\nbecause the regular selection has not yet been finalised.\n\nNow according to the impugned direction the temporary hands\ncompleting one year's service will have to be regularised in\nthose posts which means frustating the - regular selection.\nThere would be no post left for regularly selected persons\neven if they are selected. Such cases have indeed come to\nthis court from these very two States.\n\n (b) In some situations, the permanent incumbent of a\npost may be absent for more than a year. Examples of this\nare not wanting. He may go on deputation, he may go on\nFaculty Improvement Programme (F.I.P.), or he may be\nsuspended pending enquiry into charges against him and so\non. There may be any number of such situations. If a person\nis appointed temporarily in his place and after one year he\nis made permanent where will the permanent incumbent be\nplaced on his return? Two persons cannot\n\n 853\n\nhold the same post on a regular or permanent basis.\n\n (c) It may also happen that for a particular post a\nqualified person is not available at a given point of time.\nPending another attempt at selection later on an unqualified\nperson is appointed temporarily. He may continue for more\nthan one year. If he is to be regularised, it would not only\nmean foreclosing of appointment of a regular qualified\nperson, it would also mean appointment of an unqualified\nperson.\n\n (d) Such directions have also the effect of\ndisregarding and violating the rule relating to reservation\nin favour of backward class of citizens made under \nArticle\n16(4).\n What cannot be done directly cannot be allowed to be\ndone in such indirect manner.\n\n (e) Many appointments may have been made irregularly -\nas in this case - in the sense that the candidates were\nneither sponsored by the Employment Exchange nor were they\nappointed after issuing a proper advertisement calling for\napplications. In short, it may be a back door entry. A\ndirection to regularise such appointments would only result\nin encouragement to such unhealthy practices.\n\n These are but a few problems that may arise, if such\ndirections become the norm. There may be many such and other\nproblems that may arise. All this only emphasises the need\nfor a fuller consideration and due circumspection while\ngiving such directions.\n\n 13 . Now we shall proceed to examine whether the High\nCourt was right in holding that the several conditions\nprescribed in the orders issued by the two Governments from\ntime to time are bad. In particular, whether the High Court\nwas right in holding that prescribing a particular date by\nwhich the prescribed period of service should have been put\nin and the further condition that the candidate must have\nbeen sponsored by Employment Exchange, are arbitrary and\nunreasonable. These G.Os. were issued by the Government from\ntime to time. These orders are not in the nature of a\nstatute which is applicable to all existing and future\nsituations. They were issued to meet a given situation\nfacing the Government at a given point of time. In the\ncircumstances therefore, there was nothing wrong in\nprescribing a particular date by which the specified period\nof service (whether it is one year or two years) ought to\nhave been put in. Take for example, the orders issued by the\nHaryana Government. The first order is\n\n 854\n\ndated 1st January, 1980. It says, a person must have\ncompleted two years of service as on 31st December, 1979,\ni.e., the day previous to the issuance of the order. How\ncould it be said that fixing of such a date is arbitrary and\nunreasonable? Similarly the order dated 3rd January, 1983\nfixes 15th September, 1982 as the relevant date. This\nnotification/order does two things. Firstly, it excludes\nclass III posts of clerks from the purview of the S.S.S.B.\nin case of those who have completed a minimum of two years\nof service as on 15th September, 1982, and secondly, it\nprovides for their regularisation subject to certain\nconditions. No particular attack was made as to this date in\nthe High Court. Consequently the Government of Haryana had\nno opportunity of explaining as to why this particular date\nwas fixed. Without giving such an opportunity, it cannot be\nheld that the fixation of the said date is arbitrary. What\nis more relevant is that the High Court has not held that\nthis particular date is arbitrary. According to it, fixation\nof any date whatsoever is arbitrary, because in its opinion\nthe order must say that any and every person who completes\nthe prescribed period of service must be regularised on\ncompletion of such period of service. The next order dated\n24th March, 1987 prescribes the date as 31.12.1986 i.e., the\nend of the previous year. In the circumstances, we see no\nbasis for holding that fixation of the date can be held to\nbe arbitrary in the facts and circumstances of the case. \nIn\nthis connection, reference may be made to the decision of\nthis court in \nDr. Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan\n,\n(1985) S.C. 367. The Governor of Rajasthan had issued an\nordinance stating that \"all temporary lectures as were\nappointed as such on or before the 25th day of June 1975 and\nare continuing as such at the commencement of the Rajasthan\nUniversities Teachers (Absorption of Temporary Lecturers)\nOrdinance, 1978 (Ordinance No. 5 of 1978) shall be\nconsidered by the University concerned for their absorption\nand substantive appointment on the recommendation of the\nScreening Committee constituted under \nsection 4\n subject to\ntheir fulfilling the conditions of eligibility including\nminimum qualifications prescribed by the University\nconcerned under the relevant law as applicable on the\nrespective dates of their temporary appointments and subject\nalso the availability of substantive vacancies of lecturers\nin the department concerned.\"\n\n The validity of the said ordinance was questioned on\nthe ground that the fixation of the date, 25th day of June,\n1975, was arbitrary and has been chosen only because that\nwas the date on which internal emergency was proclaimed. It\nwas also submitted that the further requirement that the\n\n 855\n\nlecturer appointed should be continuing as such on the date\nof commencement of the ordinance (12.6.1978) is an equally\narbitrary and unreasonable condition. Both these contentions\nwere rejected by this court. The court negatived the\ncontention that the prescription of the said date and the\nfurther requirement of being in service on the date of\nordinance have the effect of excluding persons who have put\nin long years of service but were not continuing on the date\nof ordinance, making the said conditions discriminatory.\nSuch possibilities, it was held, were not enough to\ncastigate the said condition as aribitrary. It was observed\nthat there was no evidence to show any attempt on the part\nof the Government to separate or penalise pre-emergency\nappointees or for that matter any particular class of\noppointees. In this context, we must remember that what is\nin issue is not the wisdom of the executive in issuing a\nparticular order or orders but the validity thereof. The\ncourt may think it more desirable that the order should be\nin particular terms as indicated by it, but that is not\nenough.\n\n 14. The next question is whether the orders issued by\nthe two Government were arbitrary and unreasonable in so far\nas they prescribed that only those employees who had been\nsponsored by Employment Exchange should alone be\nregularised. In our opinion, this was a reasonable and\nwholesome requirement designed to curb and discourage back\ndoor entry and irregular appointments. The Government orders\nsay that all those who have been sponsored by Employment\nExchange or have been appointed after issuing a public\nadvertisement alone should be regularised. We see no\nunreasonableness or invalidity in the same. As stated above,\nit is a wholesome provision and ought not to have been\ninvalidated. Moreover, as pointed out hereinbefore, it is\nnot found by the High Court that the writ petitioners were\nappointed only after obtaining a non-availability\ncertificate from the Employment Exchange. The decision\nrelied upon by the High Court does not say that even without\nsuch a certificate from Employment Exchange, an appointment\ncan be made or that such appointment should be consistent\nwith the mandate of \nArticles 14\n and \n16.\n\n We must also say that the further requirement\nprescribed in the orders viz., that the employees must have\npossessed the prescribed qualifications for the post at the\ntime of his appointment on ad hoc basis is equally a valid\ncondition. Indeed, no exception is taken to it by the High\nCourt.\n\n 856\n\n 15. We may now consider whether the High Court was\njustified in holding that inasmuch as Haryana and Punjab are\nsister States and because prior to 1966 Haryana was a part\nof Punjab, the rule relating to length of service requisite\nfor regularisation should be uniform in both the states. We\nsee absolutely no basis for the said holding. They are two\ndifferent States having their own Governments, merely\nbecause one Government chooses to say that one year's\ntemporary or ad hoc service is enough for regularisation it\ncannot be said that the other state must also prescribe the\nvery same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or\nshorter period. The fact that there is a single High Court\nfor both the States and the Union Territory of Chandigarh is\nno ground for saying that the orders issued by them should\nbe uniform.\n\n 16. The learned Judges have further directed that in so\nfar as the State of Haryana is concerned class III and IV\nposts which were within the purview of the S.S.S.B. shall\nequally be within the purview of regularisation orders\nissued by it. The learned Judges have pointed out that for a\nperiod of 10 years there was no such Board functioning and\nfurther that from the year 1970 to 1987 \"most of the class\nIII and IV posts with which we are concerned were kept out\nof the purview of the S.S.S.B. \"The correctness of the said\nfactual statement is not questioned before us. It is\ntherefore, not necessary to alter or modify the direction\nmade by the High Court on this aspect. In fact, no arguments\nwere addressed to us with respect to the said direction made\nby the High Court. If any of the petitioners have been\nexcluded from consideration (for regularisation) on the\nbasis of the above condition, they may be considered and\nappropriate orders passed.\n\n 17. Now coming to the direction that all those\nadhoc/temporary employees who have continued for more than\nan year should be regularised, we find it difficult to\nsustain it. The direction has been given without reference\nto the existence of a vacancy. The direction in effect means\nthat every adhoc/temporary employee who has been continued\nfor one year should be regularised even though (a) no\nvacancy is available for him- which means creation of a\nvacancy (b) he was not sponsored by the Employment Exchange\nnor was he appointed in pursuance of a notification calling\nfor applications - which means he had entered by a back-door\n\n(c) he was not eligible and/or qualified for the post at the\ntime of his appointment (d) his record of service since his\nappointment is not satisfactory. These are in addition to\nsome of the problems indicated by us in pare 12,\n\n 857\n\nwhich would arise from giving of such blanket orders. None\nof the decisions relied upon by the High Court justify such\nwhole-sale , Unconditional orders. Moreover, from the mere\ncontinuation of an adhoc employee for one year, it cannot be\npresumed that there is need for a regular post. Such a\npresumption may be justified only when such continuance\nextends to several years. Further, there can be no 'rule of\nthumb' in such matters. Conditions and circumstances of one\nunity may not be the same as of the other. Just because in\none case, a direction was given to regularise employees who\nhave put in one year's service as far as possible and\nsubject to fulfilling the qualifications, it cannot be held\nthat in each and every case such a direction must follow\nirrespective of and without taking into account the other\nrelevant circumstances and considerations. The relief must\nbe moulded in each case having regard to all the relevant\nfacts and circumstances of that case. It cannot be a\nmechanical act but a judicious one. Judged from this stand\npoint, the impugned directions must be held to be totally\nuntenable and unsustainable.\n\n \n18. So far as the members of the work-charged\nestablishment are concerned, the nature of their employment\nis already pronounced upon by this court in \nJaswant Singh v.\nUnion\n of india, [1980] 1 S.C.R.426\n It is stated therein:\n\n \"A work-charged establishment broadly means an\n establishment of which the expensed, including the\n wages and allowances of the staff, are chargeable\n to \"works\". The pay and allowances of employees\n who are borne on a work-charged establishment are\n generally shown as a separate sub-head of the\n estimated cost of the work.\n\n The entire strength of labour employed for\n the purpose of the Beas Project was work-charged.\n The work-charged employees are engaged on a\n temporary basis and their appointments are made for\n the executive of a specific work. From the very\n nature of their employment, their services\n automatically come to an end on end on the\n completion of the works for the sole purpose of\n which they are employed. They do not get any\n relief under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n nor do\n they receive any retrenchment benefits or any\n benefits under the Employees State Insurance\n Schemes.\n\n 858\n\n But though the work-charged employees are\n denied these benefits, they are industrial workers\n and are entitled to the benefits of the provisions\n contained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n. Their\n rights flow from that special enactment under which\n even contracts of employment are open to adjustment\n and modification. The work-charged employees,\n therefore, are in a better position than temporary\n servants like the other petitioners who are liable\n to be thrown out of employment without any kind of\n compensatory benefits.\"\n\n Be that as it may, so far as the State of Haryana is\nconcerned, this contention has become of academic interest\nin view of the orders issued on 24th March, 1987 and 6th\nApril 1990, which we shall presently notice. In view of the\nsaid orders, the direction given by the High Court becomed\nunneccesary. Though the State of Punjab has not issued any\nsuch orders, it appears from the the affidavit filed on its\nbehalf(sworn to by Sri P.C.Sangar, Deputy Secretary to the\nGovernment, Department of Personnel dated 19.3.1991) that a\nscheme of regularisation of these employees has been\nprepared in pursuance of the impugned judgement. The said\nscheme is, however, not made conditional upon the result of\nthese appeals against the judgment. On a perusal of the\nscheme, we find it to be a reasonably fair scheme. We hope\nand trust that irrespective of the result of these appeals,\nthe said scheme shall be given effect to by the State of\nPunjab.\n\n 19. The High Court has also directed that all those\nemployees who fall within the definition of \"workmen\"\ncontained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n will also be\nentitled to regularisation on par with the work-charged\nemployees in whose case it is directed that they should be\nregularised on completing five years of service in Punjab\nand four years of service in Haryana. This direction is\ngiven in favour of those casual labour and daily wagers who\nfall within the definition of workmen. In so far as work-\ncharged employees, daily wage workers and casual labourers\nwho do not fall within the definition of workmen are\nconcerned, the High Court had directed their regularisation\non completion of one year's service. We find this direction\nas untenable as the direction in the case of adhoc/temporary\nemployees. In so far as the persons belonging to the above\ncategories and who fall within the definition of Workmen are\nconcerned, the terms in which the direction has been given\nby the High Court cannot be sustained. While we agree that\npersons belonging to these categories continuing over\n\n 859\n\na number of years have a right to claim regularisation and\nthe authorities are under an obligation to consider their\ncase for regularisation in a fair manner, keeping in view\nthe principles enunciated by this court, the blanket\ndirection given cannot be sustained. We need not, however,\npursue this discussion in view of the orders of the\nGovernment of Haryana contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990\nwhich provide for regularisation of these persons on\ncompletion of ten years. We shall presently notice the\ncontents of the said letter. In view of the same, no\nfurther directions are called for at this stage. The\nGovernment of Punjab, of course, does not appear to have\nissued any such orders governing these categories.\nAccordingly, there shall be a direction to the Government of\nPunjab to verify the vacancy position in the categories of\ndaily wagers and casual labour and frame a scheme of\nabsorption in a fair and just manner providing for\nregularisation of these persons, having regard to their\nlength of service and other relevant conditions. As many\npersons as possible shall be absorbed. The scheme shall be\nframed within six months from today.\n\n \n20. So far as temporary or time-bound schemes are\nconcerned, the matter is exhaustively dealt with and\npronounced upon in \nDelhi Development Horticulture\nEmployees Union v. Delhi Administration\n, (1992) 1 J.T. 394.\n\nWe need not add to it. In any event, the direction given by\nthe High Court with respect to this category has not been\nassailed before us.\n\n 21. We may also point out that after the filing of the\nwrit petitions and during the pendency of the Special Leave\nPetitions in this court, the Government of Haryana has\nissued certain further orders to which reference may now be\nmade.\n\n (i) On 24th March 1987 the Chief Secretary to the\nGovernment of Haryana wrote to all the Heads of Departments\nand others stating the following : \"the matter relating to\nthe regularisations of the work charged employees was\nengaging attention of the Government for some time past.\nAfter careful consideration it has now been decided that\nthe services of all the work charge employees working in the\nHaryana State who have completed four years or more\ncontinuous service on 31.12.1986 should be regularised\".\nAll the authorities were directed to take immediate\nappropriate action in that behalf. (We have no reason to\nbelieve that the said orders will not be given effect to in\nfull).\n\n (ii) On 5th February, 1990 the Chief Secretary to the\nGovernment of\n\n 860\n\nHaryana wrote to all the Heads of Departments and others\napprising them of the new policy and procedure evolved by\nthe Government in the matter of making adhoc appointments.\nThe letter says that no adhoc appointment shall be made in\nfuture on any posts unless a proper requisition has been\nsent to Haryana Public Service Commission/Subordinate\nServices Selection Board. It says further that if any adhoc\nappointment is required to be made it shall be made only\nthrough Employment Exchange or by advertising such post in\na daily newspaper after obtaining a N.A.C. certificate from\nthe Employment Exchange. Such appointment even if made\nshall not last beyond nine months and will be subject to a\nregular appointment being made by H.P.S.C./S.S.S.B.\n\n (iii) In pursuance of the interim orders passed by this\ncourt in this batch (recording the undertaking given by the\ncounsel for the State of Haryana to frame a scheme for\nabsorption) the Government of Haryana did frame of such a\nscheme contained in the Chief Secretary's letter dated\n6.4.1990 addressed to all the Heads of Department. It\ncovers the ad hoc employees, work charged employees, casual\nworkers/daily rated employees, workmen, ad hoc/temporary\nemployees in temporary organisation as also seasonal\nworkers. It is but appropriate that we set out the said\nletter in full:\n\n No.6/4/90-2GSI\n From\n The Chief Secretary to Govt., Haryana\n To\n\n 1. All Head of Departments, Commissioner\n Ambala, Hisar, Rohtak and Gurgaon Divisions and all\n the Deputy Commissions in the State.\n\n 2. The Registrar, Punjab and Haryana High Court,\n Chandigarh.\n\n Dated Chandigarh, the\n Subject: Policy regarding regularisation of\n adhoc/work- charged employees and causal/daily\n wagers etc.\n c ........................\n\n Sir,\n\n 861\n\n I am directed to refer to the subject noted\n above and to state that the matter regarding laying\n down the policy with regard to regularisation of\n the services of Class-III ad hoc employees, work-\n charged/daily wagers etc. has been under\n consideration of Govt. for some time past. After\n careful consideration, it has been decided that the\n Regularisation of these employees shall be on the\n following terms and conditions:-\n\n Category-I, Adhoc employees\n\n (i) Only such adhoc class-III employees, who have\n completed two years service on 30.9.1988,\n shall be regularized to the extent of\n available regular posts/vacancies on that date.\n\n (ii) The work and conduct of such employees should\n have been over all good category and no\n disciplinary proceedings are pending against\n them.\n\n (iii)The employees posses the prescribed\n qualifications for the post at the time of\n their appointment on adhoc basis.\n\n (iv) The regularisation will be against the\n posts/vacancies of the relevant categories only and\n in case, the employees belonging to general\n category have been appointed against reserved\n category posts/vacancies the services of such adhoc\n appointees shall not be regularises and their\n services shall be terminated in case, no general\n category vacancy/post(s) is available on 30.9.88.\n\n (v) The recommendees of the SSS board shall be\n absorbed against the remaining vacancies, if any.\n\n The names of such remaining recommendees as cannot\n be absorbed shall be returned to the Board to\n enable it to recommend their names to other\n departments for appointments against the clear\n vacancies.\n\n (vi) After regularisation of adhoc employees under\n the policy, if some posts/vacancies still remain\n unfilled, these shall be filled in from the\n recommendees of the SSS Board, if any. If some\n shortfall remains even after than, the procedure\n \nlaid down in\n the insts. issued vide No.50/35/88-\n 5GSI, dated\n\n 862\n\n 5.2.90 shall be followed, for making up the\n shortfall, it felt necessary.\n\n (vii) The employees, who are not covered under the\n above policy, their services shall be terminated.\n\n (viii) The seniority of the adhoc class-III\n employees so regularised viz-a-viz class-III\n employees appointed on regular basis shall be\n determined w.e.f.30.9.88. The inter-se seniority\n of such adhoc Class-III employees shall be\n determined in accordance with the date of joining\n the post on adhoc basis. If the date of joining\n the post(s), on adhoc basis by such adhoc employees\n was the same, then the elder employee shall rank\n senior to an employee younger in age. If the date\n of joining the direct recruit and the date of\n Regularisation is the same, the direct recruit\n shall be senior.\n\n Category-II. Work-Charged employees\n The work-charged employees who have completed 4\n or more years of continuous service as on 30.9.88\n shall be regularised. On Regularisation these\n employees shall be liable for transfer anywhere in\n the State of Haryana on any project/work.\n Category-III. Casual Workers/Daily rated employees\n With regard to these employees, the following\n policy will be followed:\n\n (i) Casual/daily rated employees appointed on or\n before\n 30.9.1983 shall be treated as monthly rated\n established employees on a fixed pay of Rs. 750\n (minimum of Class-IV pay scale) or the rates as\n fixed by the Deputy Commission concerned p.m.\n without any allowance w.e.f. 1.10.88. They shall be\n entitled to an annual increment of Rs. 12 till\n their services are regularized. On Regularisation,\n they shall be put in the time scale of pay\n applicable to the lowest Group 'D' in the Govt. and\n they would be entitled to all other allowances and\n benefits available to regular Govt. servants of the\n corresponding grade.\n\n 863\n\n (ii) The casual of daily rated employees, who have\n completed 10 years or more of service on 30.9.88\n shall be regularized w.e.f. 1.10.88 on the basis of\n seniority-cum-suitability.\n\n (iii) In respect of all such daily rated employees\n who have not yet completed 5 years service, a\n special review should be carried out regarding the\n requirement of their continuance or retrenchment as\n the case may be.\n\n (iv) In the case of those, who are required to be\n continued in service, the same terms and conditions\n will be applicable as in sub-paras (i) & (ii) above\n on completion of 5 years and 10 years service\n respectively.\n\n (v) In the case of those whose services are no\n longer required, they may be relieved of their\n duties at the earliest possible.\n\n Category-IV. Workmen.\n\n The employee, who come within the definition\n of 'Workmen' under the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n,\n shall be entitled to the benefits under the Act and\n their services should be dispensed with only after\n following the procedure \nlaid down in\n the Act and\n after granting the requisite retrenchment benefits.\n Category-V. Adhoc/temporary employees in temporary\n organization.\n\n The services of the employees working in\n temporary organization can be terminated at the\n abandonment of the scheme and they will not be\n eligible for Regularisation.\n\n Category-VI. Seasonal workers.\n\n The services of seasonal workers appointed as\n daily wager or on work-charged basis shall not be\n regularized and they will be retrenched on\n completion/abandonment of the work.\n\n 2. The above policy may be brought to the notice of\n all concerned for strict compliance.\n\n Yours\n faithfully,\n\n 864\n\n Sd/-\n\n Under Secretary General\n Administration\n for Chief Secretary to Government,\n Haryana.\n\n (iv) On 28th February, 1991, yet another order has been\nissued by the Governor of Haryana under the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\n of the Constitution providing for regularisation\nof class III employees who have put in service of two years\non 31st December, 1990 subject to usual conditions. This\norder reads as follows:\n\n \"Notification\n The 28th February, 1991\n No. G.S.R. 11/Const./Art.309/91.- In exercise of\n the powers conferred by the proviso to \narticle 309\n\n of the Constitution of India read with the proviso\n to clause 6 of Haryana Government, General\n Administration Department (General Services),\n notification No.523-3 GSI-70/2068, dated the 28th\n January, 1970 the Governor of Haryana hereby\n specifies such Class III posts as have been held\n for a minimum period of two years on the 31st\n December, 1990, by Class III employees on ad hoc\n basis to be taken out of the perview of the\n Subordinate Services Selection Board, Haryana and\n their services shall be regularised if they fulfill\n the following conditions, namely:-\n\n (i) that the employees have completed two years\n services on 31st December, 1990, and were in\n service on 31st December, 1990.\n\n (ii) that the employees shall be regularised\n against the posts/vacancies of relevant categories.\n\n The employees of general category may be\n regularised in excess of their quota with the clear\n stipulation that in future recruitments only the\n candidates from reserve categories will be\n appointed until the back log arising out of\n utilisation of reserve category vacancies by\n general category ad hoc employees is cleared:\n\n (iii) that the employees should have been recruited\n through the Employment Exchange or directly\n appointed by the appointing\n\n 865\n\n authority after obtaining the non-availabilty\n certificate from the Employment Exchange;\n\n (iv) that the work and conduct of such employees\n shall be of over all good category and no\n disciplinary proceedings are pending against them,\n and\n\n (v) that the employees possessed the prescribed\n qualifications for the post at the time of their\n appointment on ad hoc basis.\n\n 2. The seniority of the ad hoc Class III employees\n so regularised, viz-a-viz, the Class III employees\n appointed on regular basis should be determined\n with effect from 31st December, 1990. The inter-\n se-seniority of such ad hoc Class III employees\n shall be determined in accordance with the date of\n their joining the post on ad hoc basis.

So far as the Punjab Government is concerned, an\naffidavit sworn to by Sri G.K.Bansal, Under Secretary to the\nGovernment, Department of Personnel, Government of Punjab\nhas been filed before us stating that the instructions\nissued by the Haryana Government for regularisation of the\nservices of class III ad hoc employees contained in their\nnotification dated 28.2.1991 shall be adopted by the Punjab\nGovernment mutatis mutandis. The relevant portion of the\naffidavit may be extracted herein below:\n\n \"The policy instructions for the regularisation of\n services of Class-III adhoc employees issued by\n Haryana Government vide their notification dated\n 28/2/91 mutatis mutandis will be adopted as under:-\n\n 866\n\n (i) That the adhoc/temporarily appointed employees\n should have completed a minimum of two years\n service on 31/12/90 and was in service on 31/12/90.\n\n While calculating the period of service, any break\n of notional nature not exceeding 30 days falling\n between adhoc/temporarily appointments in the same\n category of post (s) and in the same Department is\n to be ignored. However, the break in\n adhoc/temporary service would be ignored in cases\n where:\n\n (a) The employee concerned left service of his own\n volition either to join some other Department or\n for some other reasons, or\n\n (b) the adhoc/temporary appointment was against a\n post/vacancy for which no regular recruitment was\n intended/required to be made e.g. leave\n arrangements for filling of other short-term\n vacancies.\n\n (ii) that they fulfill the conditions of\n eligibility as prescribed (i.e. they have been\n recruited through the Employment Exchange or by\n open advertisement) academic qualifications,\n experience and the condition of age at the time of\n their first/adhoc/temporary appointment in\n accordance with the Departmental service rules and\n instructions issued by the government.\n\n (iii) that their record of service is satisfactory.\n\n (iv) that they have been found medically fit for\n entry into Government service and that their\n character and antecedents have also been duly\n verified and found suitable for Government service;\n\n (v) that a regular post/vacancy is available for\n regularisation;\n\n (vi) that they have been found fit for\n regularisation by the Departmental Selection\n Committees constituted in accordance with the\n instructions contained in Government circular\n letter No.12/30/86/IGE/5139 dated 15/4/86;\n\n (vii) The seniority of the adhoc/temporarily\n appointed class-III employees so regularized vis-a-\n\n vis class-III employees appointed\n\n 867\n\n on regular basis shall be determined w.e.f.\n 31.12.90. The inter-se seniority of such\n adhoc/temporarily appointed class-III employees\n shall be determined in accordance with the date of\n their joining the post on adhoc/temporary basis. If\n the date of joining the post(s) on adhoc/temporary\n basis by such adhoc/temporarily appointed employees\n was the same then an older employee shall rank\n senior to an employee younger in age. If the date\n of joining of the direct recruit and the date of\n regularisation of adhoc-temporarily appointed\n employee is the same, the direct recruit shall be\n senior;\n\n The cases of such adhoc/temporarily appointed\n employees who have already completed three years\n service on 31st December, 90 and have satisfactory\n record of service but who do not fulfill the\n prescribed conditions with regard to\n qualifications, age or mode of their initial\n recruitment will also be considered for\n regularisation in relaxation of these conditions if\n the Departmental Service Rules applicable to these\n employees provide for relaxation of these\n conditions of recruitment.\"\n\n We are sure that many of the employees would get\nregularised under the orders aforementioned issued by both\nthe Governments.\n\n 23. This is not a case, we must reiterate, where the\nGovernments have failed to take any steps for regularisation\nof their adhoc employees working over the years. Every few\nyears they have been issuing orders providing for\nregularisation. In such a case, there is no occasion for the\ncourt to issue any directions for regularising such\nemployees more particularly when none of the conditions\nprescribed in the said orders can be said to be either\nunreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The court cannot\nobviously help those who cannot get regularised under these\norders for their failure to satisfy the conditions\nprescribed therein. Issuing general declaration of\nindulgence is no part of our jurisdiction. In case of such\npersons we can only observe that it is for the respective\nGovernments to consider the feasibility of giving them\nappropriate relief, particularly in cases where persons have\nbeen continuing over a long number of years, and were\neligible and qualified on the date of their adhoc\nappointment and further whose record of service is\nsatisfactory.\n\n 868\n\n 24. With respect to direction No. 8 (equal pay for\nequal work) we find the judgment singularly devoid of any\ndiscussion. The direction given is totally vague. It does\nnot make it clear who will get what pay and on what basis.\nThe said direction is liable to be set aside on this account\nand is, accordingly, set aside.\n\n In the matters posted before and heard by us, there are\nseveral S.L.Ps. preferred against orders of the High Court\nallowing writ petitions following the judgment in Piara\nSingh. Leave is granted in all such matters as well and the\nappeals allowed in the same terms as the appeals against the\njudgement in Piara Singh.\n\n 25. Before parting with this case, we think it\nappropriate to say a few words concerning the issue of\nregularisation of adhoc/temporary employees in government\nservice.\n\n The normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment\nthrough the prescribed agency but exigencies of\nadministration may sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary\nappointment to be made. In such a situation, effort should\nalways be to replace such an adhoc/temporary employee by a\nregularly selected employee as early as possible. Such a\ntemporary employee may also compete along with others for\nsuch regular selection/appointment. If he gets selected,\nwell and good, but if he does not, he must give way to the\nregularly selected candidate. The appointment of the\nregularly selected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in\nabeyance for the sake of such an adhoc/temporary employee.\n\n Secondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be\nreplaced by another adhoc or temporary employee; he must be\nreplaced only by a regularly selected employee. This is\nnecessary to avoid arbitrary action on the part of the\nappointing authority.\n\n Thirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment is\nnecessitated on account of the exigencies of administration,\nhe should ordinarily be drawn from the employment exchange\nunless it cannot brook delay in which case the pressing\ncause must be stated on the file. If no candidate is\navailable or is not sponsored by the employment exchange,\nsome appropriate method consistent with the requirements of\n\nArticle 16\n should be followed. In other words, there must\nbe a notice published in the appropriate\n\n 869\n\nmanner calling for applications and all those who apply in\nresponse thereto should be considered fairly.\n\n An unqualified person ought to be appointed only when\nqualified persons are not available through the above\nprocesses.\n\n If for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is\ncontinued for a fairly long spell, the authorities must\nconsider his case for regularisation provided he is eligible\nand qualified according to rules and his service record is\nsatisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to the\nreservation policy of the State.\n\n The proper course would be that each States prepares a\nscheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation\nof such employees consistent with its reservation policy and\nif a scheme is already framed, the same way be made\nconsistent with our observations herein so as to reduce\navoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such\nperson is regularised he should be placed immediately below\nthe last regularly appointed employee in that category,\nclass or service, as the case may be.\n\n So far as the work-charged employees and casual labour\nare concerned, the effort must be to regularise them as far\nas possible and as early as possible subject to their\nfulfilling the qualifications, if any, prescribed for the\npost and subject also to availability of work. If a casual\nlabourer is continued for a fairly long spell - say two or\nthree years - a presumption may arise that there is regular\nneed for his services. In such a situation, it becomes\nobligatory for the concerned authority to examine the\nfeasibility of his regularisation. While doing so, the\nauthorities ought to adopt a positive approach coupled with\nan empathy for the person. As has been repeatedly stressed\nby this court, security of tenure is necessary for an\nemployee to give his best to the job. In this behalf, we do\ncommend the orders of the Government of Haryana (contained\nin its letter dated 6.4.90 referred to hereinbefore) both in\nrelation to work-charged employees as well as casual labour.\n\n We must also say that the orders issued by the\nGovernments of Punjab and Haryana providing for\nregularisation of adhoc/temporary employees who have put in\ntwo years/one year of service are quite generous and leave\nno room for any legitimate grievance by any one.\n\n 870\n\n These are but a few observations which we thought it\nnecessary to make, impelled by the facts of this case, and\nthe spate of litigation by such employees. They are not\nexhaustive nor can they be understood as immutable. Each\nGovernment or authority has to devise its own criteria or\nprinciples for regularisation having regard to all the\nrelevant circumstances, but while doing so, it should bear\nin mind the observations made herein.\n\n 26. So far as the employees and workmen employed by\nStatutory/Public Corporations are concerned, it may be noted\nthat they have not issued any orders akin to those issued by\nthe Punjab and Haryana Government. Even so, it is but\nappropriate that they adopt as far as possible, keeping the\nexigencies and requirements of their administration in view,\nthe criteria and principles underlying the orders issued by\ntheir Government in the matter of regularisation and pass\nappropriate orders. In short, the Statutory/Public\nCorporations in Haryana will follow the orders contained in\nthe letter dated 6.4.1990 \nreferred to above\n, as supplemented\nby the orders in the Notification dated 28.2.1991, where as\nthe Statutory/Public Corporations in Punjab shall follow the\ncriteria and principles stated in the affidavit of Sri\nG.K.Bansal, Under Secretary to the Government of Punjab,\nDepartment of Personnel referred to in para 22 above. These\ndirections shall not, however, apply to these\nStatutory/Public Corporations functioning within these\nStates as are under the control of the Government of India.\nThese Corporations will do well to evolve an appropriate\npolicy of regularisation, in the light of this judgment, if\nthey have not already evolved one, or make their existing\npolicy consistent with this judgment to avoid litigation.\n\n 27. For the above reasons, all the appeals are allowed\nand the orders under appeal are set aside. The directions\ngiven by the High Court in the judgment in W.P.(C) No.72/88\nnamely direction Nos. 1,2,3,4,6 and 8 are set aside. The\nonly direction given herewith is the one contained in para\n\n19.\n The writ petitions seeking the benefits given in the\njudgment under appeal are dismissed.\n\n No costs.\n\nH N.P.V.\n Appeals disposed of.\n\n 871",

As a result, a large number of ad hoc\nemployees were continuing for several years without being\nregularised and were agitating for their regularisation. To\nmeet the situation, both the appellant Governments issued\norders from time to time for regularisation of such\nemployees subject to certain conditions.\n In pursuance of these orders a number of persons, who\nsatisfied the conditions prescribed in each of those order s\nwere regularised, but many could not be, for the reason that\nthey did not satisfy one or the other of the conditions\nprescribed in the said orders. They were, however, allowed\nto continue in service. This category of people approached\nthe High Court praying for issuance of writ, order or\ndirection for regularisation of their service. They\ncontended that the conditions in the said orders were\narbitrary, discriminatory and unrelated to the object.\n The work-charged employees, daily-wagers, casual labour\nand those\n 827\nemployed in temporary/time-bound projects also approached\nthe High Court for regularisation of their services. Some\nof the petitioners also pleaded for equal pay for equal\nwork.\n Accepting the pleas of the petitioners, the High Court\ngave certain directions to the appellant-States for\nregularisation of these employees.\n Aggrieved by the High Court's orders, the two appellant\nStates filed appeals before this Court. Some of the\nemployees also filed Writ Petitions before this Court\ndirectly, contending that they too were governed by the\ndirections given by the High Court and that they should be\ngiven the benefit of the same.\n On behalf of the appellants the validity and\ncorrectness of the directions given by the High Court were\nquestioned on the grounds that the High Court had exceeded\nits jurisdiction in virtually amending the Government orders\nand was not justified in holding that the fixation of a\nparticular date in the respective Government orders was\narbitrary and/or that it was unrelated to the object sought\nto be achieved; that the High Court also erred in holding\nthat the requirement of having been sponsored by the\nEmployment Exchange was invalid; that the High Court was not\njustified in directing that all persons who had put in one\nyear's service should be regularised unconditionally; and\nthat such a direction would given rise to several\ndifficulties and complications for the administration, that\nthere could be a direction for regularisation, without a\npost or a vacancy and the Government could not be directed\nto create posts without number, and it was beyond the\ncapacity of any Government to comply with such directions;\nthat the direction with respect to work-charged\nestablishment, casual labour and daily wagers equally\nunsustainable in law; that the rule prescribing minimum\nqualifying service of one year in one State could not be\nthrust upon the other State; that because of the directions\nin question, while regularly selected persons would be kept\nout of jobs, unqualified ineligible persons who had come\nthrough back door and whose records of service might also\nnot be satisfactory would be regularised at one go and the\nrule of reservation would also be violated and that it was\nthe prerogative of the Executive to create and abolish\nposts, and that the Government could not be compelled to\ncreate posts where there was no need for such posts or where\nthe need is no longer there.\n 828\n It was contended on behalf of the respondents and the\nwrit petitioners that the directions had been given with a\nview to curb the arbitrariness of the authorities and with a\nview to give a satisfactory solution to a human problem\ncreated by the policies of the Governments themselves, that\nthe work-charged employees should be treated on par with ad-\nhoc employees and ought to be regularised on the 1st of\nApril of each year, and all those persons who where working\nin the permanent posts ought to be regularised.\n Disposing of the cases, this Court,\n HELD : 1.1. Ordinarily speaking, the creation and\nabolition of a post is the prerogative of the Executive. It\nis the Executive again that lays down the conditions of\nservice subject, of course, to a law made by the appropriate\nlegislature. This power to prescribe the conditions of\nservice can be exercised either by making Rules under the\nproviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution or (in the\nabsence of such Rules) by issuing Rules/Instructions in\nexercise of its executive power. The court comes into the\npicture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights,\nstatutory provisions, Rules and other instructions, if any,\ngoverning the conditions of service. The main concern of\nthe court in such matters is to ensure the Rule of law and\nto see that the executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal\nto its employees consistent with the requirements of"

[847 F-H]\n 1.2. The State must be a model employer. It is for this\nreason it is held that equal pay must be given for equal\nwork, which is indeed one of the directive principles of the\nConstitution and that a person should not be kept in a\ntemporary or ad hoc status for long. [848A]\n 1.3. Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment is\ncontinued for long, the court presumes that there is need\nand warrant for a regular post and accordingly directs\nregularisation. While all the situations in which the court\nmay act to ensure fairness cannot be detailed, it is\nsufficient to indicate that the guiding principles are the\nones indicated above. [848B]\n Dharwad Distt. P.W.D. Literature Daily Wage Employees'\nAssociation v. State of Karnataka and Ors., [1990] 2 S.C.C.\n396 and Jacob v. Kerala\n 829\nWater Authority, [1990] Suppl. 1 S.C.R. 562, referred to.\n 2.1. The court must, while giving directions, act with\ndue care and caution. It must first ascertain the relevant\nfacts, and must be cognizant of the several situations and\neventualities that may arise on account of such directions.\nA practical and pragmatic view has to be taken, inasmuch as\nevery such direction not only tells upon the public\nexchequer but also has the effect of increasing the cadre\nstrength of a particular service, class or category.\n[852A,B]\n 2.2. In the instant case apart from the fact that the\nHigh Court was not right in holding that the several\nconditions imposed by the two Governments in their\nrespective orders relating to regularisation were arbitrary,\nnot valid and justified, it acted rather hastily in\ndirecting wholesome regularisation of all such persons who\nhave put in one year's service, and that too\nunconditionally. Several problems will arise if such\ndirections become the norm. Therefore, there is need for\nfulled consideration and due circumspection while giving\nsuch directions. [852C]\n 3.1. The Government orders in question were issued by\nthe Government from time to time. These orders are not in\nthe nature of a statute which is applicable to all existing\nand future situations. They were issued to meet a given\nsituation facing the Government at a given point of time. In\nthe circumstances, therefore, there was nothing wrong in\nprescribing a particular date by which the specified period\nof service (whether it is one year or two years) ought to\nhave been put in. [853G]\n 3.2. The first order dated 1st January, 1980 issued by\none of the States says, a person must have completed two\nyears of service as on 31st December, 1979, i.e., the day\nprevious to the issuance of the order. It cannot be said\nthat fixing of such a date is arbitrary and unreasonable.\nSimilarly, the order dated 3rd January, 1983 fixes 15th\nSeptember, 1982 as the relevant date. This\nnotification/order does two things. Firstly, it excludes\nClass III posts of clerks from the purview of the S.S.S.B.\nin case of those who have completed a minimum of two years\nof service as on 15th September, 1982, and secondly, it\nprovides for their regularisation subject to certain\nconditions. No particular attack was made as to this date\nin the High Court. Consequently, the Government had no\nopportunity of explaining as to why this particular date was\nfixed. Without giving such an opportunity it cannot be held\nthat the fixation of the said date is arbitrary.\n 830\nWhat is more relevant is that the High Court has not held\nthat this particular date is arbitrary. According to it,\nfixation of any date whatsoever was arbitrary, because, in\nits opinion, the order must say that any and every person\nwho completes the prescribed period of service must be\nregularised on completion of such period of service. The\nnext order dated 24th March, 1987 prescribes the date as\n31.12.1986. i.e., the end of the previous year. In the\ncircumstances, there is no basis for holding that fixation\nof the date can be held to be arbitrary in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. [854A-D]\n Dr. Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan, [1985] S.C.\n1367 and Inder Pal Yadav & Ors. etc. v. Union of India &\nOrs. etc., [1985] 3 S.C.R. 837, referred to.\n 3.3. The Government orders say that all those who had\nbeen sponsored by Employment Exchange or had been appointed\nafter issuing a public advertisement alone be regularised.\nThere is no unreasonableness or invalidity in the same. It\nis a reasonable and wholesome provision and a requirement\ndesigned to curb and discourage back door entry and\nirregular appointments and ought not to have been\ninvalidated. Moreover, these are not cases where the writ\npetitioners were appointed only after obtaining a non-\navailability certificate from the Employment Exchange.\n[855E-F]\n Union of India v. Hargopal, 1987 S.C. 1227, referred to.\n 3.4. The further requirement prescribed in the orders,\nviz., that the employees must have possessed the prescribed\nqualifications for the post at the time of his appointment\non ad hoc basis is equally a valid condition. [855G-H]\n 3.5. The High Court was not justified in holding that\ninasmuch as the two States were sister States and because\nprior to 1966 one State was a part of the other State, the\nrule relating to length of service requisite for\nregularisation should be uniform in both the States. They\nare two different States having their own Governments;\nmerely because one Government chooses to say that one year's\ntemporary ad hoc service is enough for regularisation it\ncannot be said that the other State must also prescribe the\nvery same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or\nshorter period. The fact that there is a single High Court\nfor both the States and\n 831\nthe Union Territory of Chandigarh is no ground for saying\nthat the orders issued by them should be uniform. [856A-C]\n 3.6. It is not necessary to alter or modify the\ndirections of the High Court, in so far as one of the States\nwas concerned, that Class III and IV posts which were within\nthe purview of the S.S.S.B. should equally be within the\npurview of regularisation orders issued by it. If any of the\npetitioners have been excluded from consideration (for\nregularisation) on the basis that most of the Class III and\nIV posts were kept out of the purview of the S.S.S.B. they\nmay be considered and appropriate orders passed. [856D-E]\n 3.7. The High Court was also not justified in giving the\ndirection that all those ad hoc/temporary employees who had\ncontinued for more than one year should be regularised. The\ndirection has been given without reference to the existence\nof a vacancy. It, in effect, means that every ad\nhoc/temporary employee who has been continued for one year\nshould be regularised even though (a) no vacancy is\navailable for him - which means creation of a vacancy (b) he\nwas not sponsored by the Employment Exchange nor was he\nappointed in pursuance of a notification calling for\napplications which means he had entered by a back-door (c)\nhe was not eligible and/or qualified for the post at the\ntime of his appointment and (d) his record of service since\nhis appointment is not satisfactory. Moreover, from the\nmere continuation of an ad hoc employee for one year, it\ncannot be presumed that there is need for a regular post.\nSuch a presumption may be justified only when such\ncontinuance extends to several years. Further, there can be\nno `rule of thumb' in such matters. Conditions and\ncircumstances of one unit may not be the same as of the\nother. Just because in one case, a direction was given to\nregularise employees who have put in one year's service as\nfar as possible and subject to fulfilling the\nqualifications, it cannot be held that in each and every\ncase such a direction must follow irrespective of and\nwithout taking into account the other relevant circumstances\nand considerations. The relief must be moulded in each case\nhaving regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances of\nthat case. It cannot be a mechanical act but a judicious\none. Judged from this stand point, the directions under\nchallenge must be held to be totally untenable and\nunsustainable. [856F-H; 857A-C]\n3.8. So far as the members of the work-charged establishment\nare\n 832\nconcerned, though the work-charged employees are denied\ncertain benefits, they are industrial workers and are\nentitled to the benefits of the provisions contained in the"

The work-charged employees,\ntherefore, are in a better position than temporary servants\nlike the other petitioners who are liable to be thrown out\nof employment without any kind of compensatory benefits.\n[857D, 858A-B]\n Jaswant Singh v. Union of India, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 426,\nreferred to.\n 3.9. In view of the orders issued on 24th March, 1987\nand 6th April, 1990 by one of the States, the direction\ngiven by the High Court becomes unnecessary. Though no\norders have been issued in this regard by the other States,\na scheme of regularisation of these employees is stated to\nhave been prepared by that State in pursuance of the\njudgment under challenge. The said scheme is, however, not\nmade conditional upon the result of these appeals against\nthe judgment. The scheme is a reasonably fair one. It is\nhoped and trusted that irrespective of the result of these\nappeals, the said scheme would be given effect to by the\nother State concerned.[858C-D]\n 3.10. The High Court has directed that all those\nemployees who fell within the definition of `workmen'\ncontained in the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n would also be\nentitled to regularisation on par with the work-charged\nemployees and that they should be regularised on completing\nfive years of service in one State and four years of\nservice in the other State. This direction is given in\nfavour of those casual labour and daily wagers who fall\nwithin the definition of workmen. Insofar as work-charged\nemployees, daily-wage workers and casual labourers who did\nnot fall within the definition of work-men are concerned,\nthe High Court has directed their regularisation on\ncompletion of one year's service. This direction is as\nuntenable as in the case of ad hoc/temporary employees. The\ndirection regarding persons belonging to the above\ncategories and who fall within the definition of workmen,\nthe terms in which the direction has been given cannot be\nsustained. While it is true that persons belonging to these\ncategories continuing over a number of years have a right to\nclaim regularisation and the authorities are under an\nobligation to consider their case for regularisation in a\nfair manner, keeping in view the prin-\n 833\nciples enunciated by this Court, the blanket direction given\ncannot be sustained. However, in view of the orders of one\nof the State Governments contained in the letter dated\n6.4.1990 which provided for regularisation of these persons\non completion of ten years, no further directions are called\nfor at this stage. The other State Government, of course,\nhas not issued any such orders governing these categories.\nAccordingly, the State Government concerned should verify\nthe vacancy position in the categories of daily-wagers and\ncasual labour and frame a scheme of absorption in a fair and\njust manner providing for regularisation of these persons,\nhaving regard to their length of service and other relevant\nconditions. As many persons as possible shall be absorbed.\nThe scheme should be framed within six months. [858F-H; 859\nA-C]\n 4. Further orders had been issued by one of the State\nGovernments, after the filing of the writ petitions and\nduring the pendency of the Special Leave Petitions in this\nCourt for regularisation of ad hoc/work-charged employees.\nThe other State Government has agreed by an affidavit before\nthis Court, to adopt the same mutatis mutandis so far as\nClass III employees are concerned. It is hoped that many of\nthe employees would get regularised under the orders\naforementioned issued by both the Governments. [859D, 865F,\n867E]\n 5.1. The instant case is not a case where the\nGovernments have failed to take any steps for regularisation\nof their ad hoc employees working over the years. Every few\nyears they have been issuing orders providing for\nregularisation. In such a case, there is no occasion for the\ncourt to issue any directions for regularising such\nemployees more particularly when none of the conditions\nprescribed in the said orders can be said to be either\nunreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. The court cannot\nobviously help those who cannot get regularised under these\norders for their failure to satisfy the conditions\nprescribed therein. Issuing general declaration of\nindulgence is no part of jurisdiction of this Court. In case\nof such persons it is for the respective Governments to\nconsider the feasibility of giving them appropriate relief,\nparticularly in case where persons have been continuing over\na long number of years, and were eligible and qualified on\nthe date of their ad hoc appointment and further whose\nrecord of service is satisfactory. [867 F-H]\n 5.2. The normal rule, is regular recruitment through the\nprescribed\n 834\nagency but exigencies of administration may sometimes call\nfor an ad hoc or temporary appointment to be made. In such a\nsituation, effort should always be to replace such an ad\nhoc/temporary employee by a regularly selected employee as\nearly as possible. Such a temporary employee may also\ncompete along with others for such regular\nselection/appointment. If he gets selected, well and good,\nbut if he does not, he must give way to the regularly\nselected candidate. The appointment of the regularly\nselected candidate. The appointment of the regularly\nselected candidate cannot be withheld or kept in abeyance\nfor the sake of such an ad hoc/temporary employee. Secondly,\nan ad hoc or temporary employee should not be replaced by\nanother ad hoc or temporary employee; he must be replaced\nonly by a regularly selected employee. This is necessary to\navoid arbitrary action on the part of the appointing\nauthority. Thirdly, even where an ad hoc or temporary\nemployment is necessitated on account of the exigencies of\nadministration, he should ordinarily be drawn from the\nemployment exchange unless it cannot brook delay in which\ncase the pressing cause must be stated on the file. If no\ncandidate is available or is not sponsored by the employment\nexchange, some appropriate method consistent with the\nrequirements of \nArticle 16\n should be followed. In other\nwords, there must be a notice published in the appropriate\nmanner calling for applications and all those who apply in\nresponse thereto should be considered fairly. An unqualified\nperson ought to be appointed only when qualified persons are\nnot available through the above processes. If for any\nreason an ad hoc or temporary employee is continued for a\nfairly long spell, the authorities must consider his case\nfor regularisation provide he is eligible and qualified\naccording to rules and his service record is satisfactory\nand his appointment does not run counter to the reservation\npolicy of the State. [868D-H; 869A-C]\n 5.3. The proper course would be that each State prepares\na scheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation\nof such employees consistent with its reservation policy and\nif a scheme is already framed, the same may be made\nconsistent with the observations herein so as to reduce\navoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when such person\nis regularised he should be placed immediately below the\nlast regularly appointed employee in that category, class or\nservice, as the case may be. [869D]\n 5.4. So far as the work-charged employees and casual\nlabour are concerned, the effort must be to regularise them\nas far as possible and as\n 835\nearly as possible subject to their fulfilling the\nqualification, if any, prescribed for the post and subject\nalso to availability of work. If a casual labourer is\ncontinued for a fairly long spell - say two or three years -\na presumption may arise that there is regular need for his\nservices. In such a situation it becomes obligatory for the\nconcerned authority to examine the feasibility of his\nregularisation. While doing so, the authorities ought to\nadopt a positive approach coupled with an empathy for the\nperson. Security of tenure is necessary for an employee to\ngive his best to the job. In this behalf, this Court\ncommends the orders of one of the State Governments,\ncontained in its letter dated 6.4.1990 both in relation to\nwork-charged employees as well as casual labour. [869 E-G]\n 5.5. The orders issued by both the Governments providing\nfor regularisation of ad hoc/temporary employees who have\nput in two years/one year of service are quite generous and\nleave no room for any legitimate grievance by any one.\n[869H]\n 5.6. These observations are not exhaustive nor can they\nbe understood as immutable. Each Government or authority has\nto devise its own criteria or principles for regularisation\nhaving regard to all the relevant circumstances, but while\ndoing so, it should bear in mind the observations made\nherein. [870 A-B]\n 6.1. So far as the employees and workmen employed by\nStatutory/Public Corporations are concerned, they have not\nissued any orders akin to those issued by the two State\nGovernments. Even so, it is but appropriate that they adopt\nas far as possible, keeping the exigencies and requirements\nof their administration in view, the criteria and principles\nunderlying the orders issued by their Government in the\nmatter of regularisation and pass appropriate orders. The\norders contained in the letter dated 6.4.1990, as\nsupplemented by the orders in the Notification dated\n28.2.1991 issued by one of the States should be followed by\nthe Statutory/Public Corporations located in that State,\nwhereas the Statutory/Public Corporations located in the\nother State should follow the criteria and principles stated\nin the affidavit of the Government of that State filed\nbefore this Court. [870 C-D]\n 6.2. These directions would not, however, apply to these\nStatutory/Public Corporations, functioning within these\nStates as are under the control of the Government of India.\nThese Corporations would evolve an\n 836\nappropriate policy of regularisation in the light of this\njudgment, if they have not already evolved one, or make\ntheir existing policy consistent with the judgment to avoid\nlitigation. [870E]\n 7. As regards, equal pay for equal work, the judgment is\nsingularly devoid of discussion. The direction given by the\nHigh Court is totally vague. It does not make it clear who\nwill get what pay and on what basis. Hence, this direction\nis set aside.\n Delhi Development Horticulture Employees' Union v. Delhi\nAdministration, (1992) 1 J.T. 394, referred to."

They were initially appointed for a\nperiod of six months or so but were continued for years\ntogether under orders passed from time to time. (In so far\nas the State of Haryana is concerned, most of the class III\nposts in the Education Department were kept out of the\npurview of the S.S.S.B. during the period 1970 to 1987.

All those\npersons who are working in the permanent posts ought to be\nregularised, says the counsel.

Inasmuch as the Government, particularly at the\npresent stage of development, is never without a project or\nwork, these employees must also be regularised.

How\ncould it be said that fixing of such a date is arbitrary and\nunreasonable? Similarly the order dated 3rd January, 1983\nfixes 15th September, 1982 as the relevant date. This\nnotification/order does two things. Firstly, it excludes\nclass III posts of clerks from the purview of the S.S.S.B.\nin case of those who have completed a minimum of two years\nof service as on 15th September, 1982, and secondly, it\nprovides for their regularisation subject to certain\nconditions. No particular attack was made as to this date in\nthe High Court. Consequently the Government of Haryana had\nno opportunity of explaining as to why this particular date\nwas fixed. Without giving such an opportunity, it cannot be\nheld that the fixation of the said date is arbitrary. What\nis more relevant is that the High Court has not held that\nthis particular date is arbitrary. According to it, fixation\nof any date whatsoever is arbitrary, because in its opinion\nthe order must say that any and every person who completes\nthe prescribed period of service must be regularised on\ncompletion of such period of service. The next order dated\n24th March, 1987 prescribes the date as 31.12.1986 i.e., the\nend of the previous year. In the circumstances, we see no\nbasis for holding that fixation of the date can be held to\nbe arbitrary in the facts and circumstances of the case. \nIn\nthis connection, reference may be made to the decision of\nthis court in \nDr. Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan\n,\n(1985) S.C. 367. The Governor of Rajasthan had issued an\nordinance stating that \"all temporary lectures as were\nappointed as such on or before the 25th day of June 1975 and\nare continuing as such at the commencement of the Rajasthan\nUniversities Teachers (Absorption of Temporary Lecturers)\nOrdinance, 1978 (Ordinance No. 5 of 1978) shall be\nconsidered by the University concerned for their absorption\nand substantive appointment on the recommendation of the\nScreening Committee constituted under \nsection 4\n subject to\ntheir fulfilling the conditions of eligibility including\nminimum qualifications prescribed by the University\nconcerned under the relevant law as applicable on the\nrespective dates of their temporary appointments and subject\nalso the availability of substantive vacancies of lecturers\nin the department concerned.\""
