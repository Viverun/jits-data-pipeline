This appeal has been preferred by the appellant - husband\n\n against the judgment and decree dated 3.10.2013 passed by the trial\n\n court, whereby the petition filed by him under \nsection 13\n of the Hindu\n\n Marriage Act, 1955 (in short, \"the Act\") for dissolution of marriage on the\n\n grounds of cruelty and desertion has been dismissed.\n\n 2. A few facts relevant for the decision of the controversy\n\n involved as available on the record may be noticed. Marriage between\n\n the parties was solemnized on 8.7.1992 according to Hindu rites and\n\n ceremonies. The appellant was under JBT training from 28.9.1992 to\n\n July 1994 and came into government job on 14.10.1995. No issue was\n\n born out of the said wedlock. The parties lastly resided together as\n\n husband and wife at the house of the appellant at Aurangabad. The\n\n marriage was simple. From the very beginning, behaviour of the\n\n respondent was not good towards the appellant and his family members.\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -2-\n\n She was interested to live in her parental house. The appellant is\n\n M.A.B.Ed and physically handicapped person. The respondent never\n\n liked him and disregarded him. She also wanted to live separately with\n\n the appellant from his parents. The appellant even accepted her demand\n\n and started living at house No.756 w.e.f 22.10.1995. Despite that, her\n\n behaviour did not change. She used to curse the appellant to be a\n\n handicapped person. On 18.12.1997, she gave beating to the appellant\n\n with lathi blows. A complaint dated 18.12.1997 was lodged by the\n\n appellant against the respondent. In 1999, the respondent left the\n\n matrimonial home. On the request of the appellant and his family\n\n members, she came back. On 14.10.2000, she again left the\n\n matrimonial home. The appellant felt shocked when he and his family\n\n members were got involved in a false criminal case by lodging FIR dated\n\n 27.3.2001 by the respondent under \nSections 498A\n, \n406\n, \n506\n IPC. The\n\n appellant was arrested on 4.4.2001 and remained in jail for four days till\n\n 8.4.2001 before getting bail. However, the appellant and his family\n\n members were acquitted vide order dated 28.7.2010 by the trial court.\n\n The appeal filed by the respondent against acquittal was also dismissed.\n\n She filed application under \nsection 125\n Cr.PC for maintenance. She was\n\n granted Rs.3000/- per month as maintenance which was paid by the\n\n appellant regularly. The respondent also filed complaint under \nsections\n\n 494\n/\n109\n IPC against the appellant and his family members which was\n\n also dismissed. Ultimately, the appellant filed petition under \nSection 13\n\n of the Act for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty and\n\n desertion. Upon notice, the respondent appeared and filed written\n\n statement controverting the averments made in the petition. The trial\n\n court after examining the entire evidence on record dismissed the\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -3-\n\n petition vide impugned judgment and decree dated 3.10.2013. Hence\n\n the instant appeal by the appellant husband.\n\n 3. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\n\n the record.\n\n \n4. Learned counsel for the appellant husband submitted that\n\n the trial court erred in law in dismissing the petition under \nsection 13\n of\n\n the Act filed by the appellant. The respondent wife is living separately\n\n since 14.10.2000. No issue was born out of the wedlock. Her behaviour\n\n towards the appellant and his family members was not good from the\n\n very beginning. She had no intention to live with the appellant. She used\n\n to curse the appellant being a handicapped person. The behaviour of the\n\n respondent caused mental cruelty to the appellant. Reliance was placed\n\n on judgments in \nVidhya Vishwanathan vs. Kartik Balakrishnan\n, 2014\n\n (4) RCR 563 and Vishwanath Agrawal vs. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal,\n\n (2012) 7 SCC 288.\n \nIn view of pronouncement of the Apex Court in\n\n \nK.Srinivas Rao vs. D.A.Deepa\n, (2013) 5 SCC 226, it was contended\n\n that cruelty was caused by the respondent-wife as false criminal\n\n complaint filed by her against the appellant and his family members had\n\n resulted in their acquittal in proceedings under \nsection 406\n, \n498A\n, \n506\n of\n\n the Indian Penal Code and the appellant is entitled to the grant of\n\n divorce.\n\n 5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent\n\n supported the impugned judgment and decree.\n\n 6. \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n of the Act empowers the Court to dissolve\n\n the matrimonial ties between the parties by a decree of divorce on a\n\n petition by either spouse where the said spouse has been treated with\n\n cruelty after the solemnization of the marriage. Cruelty has not been\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -4-\n\n defined in the Act but various pronouncements of the Apex Court and\n\n other High Courts have outlined the scope of the term 'cruelty'. Cruelty\n\n is evident where one spouse treats the other and manifests such\n\n feelings towards him or her as to cause reasonable apprehension that it\n\n will be harmful or injurious to live with the other spouse. Cruelty may be\n\n physical or mental. Whether a spouse is inflicted with physical cruelty or\n\n not, it can be judged on the basis of direct evidence whereas mental\n\n cruelty is to be inferred on analyzing the factual matrix of each case and\n\n drawing conclusion thereon.\n\n \n7. Further, in \nVidhya Vishwanathan\n's case (supra), it was\n\n held by the Apex Court as under:-\n\n \"13. \nIn \nVinita Saxena vs. Pankaj Pandit\n (2006) 3\n\n SCC 778 regarding legal proposition on aspect of\n\n cruelty has made the following observations:\n\n \"31. It is settled by a catena of decisions that\n\n mental cruelty can cause even more serious\n\n injury than the physical harm and create in the\n\n mind of the injured appellant such apprehension\n\n as is contemplated in the section. It is to be\n\n determined on whole facts of the case and the\n\n matrimonial relations between the spouses. To\n\n amount to cruelty, there must be such wilful\n\n treatment of the party which caused suffering in\n\n body or mind either as an actual fact or by way\n\n of apprehension in such a manner as to render\n\n the continued living together of spouses harmful\n\n or injurious having regard to the circumstances\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -5-\n\n of the case.\n\n 32. The word \"cruelty\" has not been defined\n\n and it has been used in relation to human\n\n conduct or human behaviour. It is the conduct in\n\n relation to or in respect of matrimonial duties\n\n and obligations. It is a course of conduct and\n\n one which is adversely affecting the other. The\n\n cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or\n\n unintentional. There may be cases where the\n\n conduct complained of itself is bad enough and\n\n per se unlawful or illegal. Then the impact or the\n\n injurious effect on the other spouse need not be\n\n enquired into or considered. In such cases, the\n\n cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is\n\n proved or admitted.\"\n\n 8. Still further, in Vishwanath Agrawal's case (supra), it was\n\n observed as under:-\n\n \"24. \nIn \nShobha Rani v. Madhukar Reddi\n, while\n\n dealing with 'cruelty' under \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n of the\n\n Act, this Court observed that the said provision does\n\n not define 'cruelty' and the same could not be defined.\n\n The 'cruelty' may be mental or physical, intentional or\n\n unintentional. If it is physical, the court will have no\n\n problem to determine it. It is a question of fact and\n\n degree. If it is mental, the problem presents difficulty.\n\n Thereafter, the Bench proceeded to state as follows:\n\n \"4.....First, the enquiry must begin as to the\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -6-\n\n nature of the cruel treatment. Second, the\n\n impact of such treatment on the mind of the\n\n spouse. Whether it caused reasonable\n\n apprehension that it would be harmful or\n\n injurious to live with the other. Ultimately, it is a\n\n matter of inference to be drawn by taking into\n\n account the nature of the conduct and its effect\n\n on the complaining spouse. There may,\n\n however, be cases where the conduct\n\n complained of itself is bad enough and per se\n\n unlawful or illegal. Then the impact or the\n\n injurious effect on the other spouse need not be\n\n enquired into or considered. In such cases, the\n\n cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is\n\n proved or admitted.\"\n\n \n25. After so stating, this Court observed in \nShobha\n\n Rani\n case about the marked change in life in modern\n\n times and the sea change in matrimonial duties and\n\n responsibilities. It has been observed that:\n\n \"5.... when a spouse makes a complaint about\n\n treatment of cruelty by the partner in life or\n\n relations, the court should not search for\n\n standard in life. A set of facts stigmatized as\n\n cruelty in one case may not be so in another\n\n case. The cruelty alleged may largely depend\n\n upon the type of life the parties are accustomed\n\n to or their economic and social conditions. It\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -7-\n\n may also depend upon their culture and human\n\n values to which they attach importance.\"\n\n \n26. Their Lordships in \nShobha Rani\n case referred\n\n to the observations made in Sheldon v. Sheldon\n\n (1966) 2 WLR 993, wherein Lord Denning stated, \"the\n\n categories of cruelty are not closed\".\n \nThereafter, the\n\n Bench proceeded to state thus: (\nShobha Rani\n case,\n\n (1988) 1 SCC 105) SCC p. 109, paras 5-6)-\n\n \"5. ......Each case may be different. We deal\n\n with the conduct of human beings who are not\n\n generally similar. Among the human beings\n\n there is no limit to the kind of conduct which\n\n may constitute cruelty. New type of cruelty may\n\n crop up in any case depending upon the human\n\n behaviour, capacity or incapability to tolerate\n\n the conduct complained of. Such is the\n\n wonderful (sic) realm of cruelty.\n\n 6. These preliminary observations are\n\n intended to emphasise that the court in\n\n matrimonial cases is not concerned with ideals\n\n in family life. The court has only to understand\n\n the spouses concerned as nature made them,\n\n and consider their particular grievance. As Lord\n\n Ried observed in Gollins v. Gollins, 1964 AC\n\n 644:\n\n \"....In matrimonial affairs we are not dealing with\n\n objective standards, it is not a matrimonial\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -8-\n\n offence to fall below the standard of the\n\n reasonable man (or the reasonable woman).\n\n We are dealing with this man or this woman.\"\n\n (emphasis in original).\n\n 27. \nIn \nV. Bhagat v. D. Bhagat (Mrs.\n), (1994) 1 SCC\n\n 337, a two-Judge Bench referred to the amendment\n\n that had taken place in \nSections 10\n and \n13(1)(ia)\n after\n\n the Hindu Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976 and\n\n proceeded to hold that the earlier requirement that\n\n such cruelty has caused a reasonable apprehension\n\n in the mind of a spouse that it would be harmful or\n\n injurious for him/her to live with the other one is no\n\n longer the requirement. Thereafter, this Court\n\n proceeded to deal with what constitutes mental cruelty\n\n as contemplated in \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n and observed\n\n that mental cruelty in the said provision can broadly\n\n be defined as that conduct which inflicts upon the\n\n other party such mental pain and suffering as would\n\n make it not possible for that party to live with the\n\n other. To put it differently, the mental cruelty must be\n\n of such a nature that the parties cannot reasonably be\n\n expected to live together. The situation must be such\n\n that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to\n\n put up with such conduct and continue to live with the\n\n other party. It was further observed, while arriving at\n\n such conclusion, that regard must be had to the social\n\n status, educational level of the parties, the society\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -9-\n\n they move in, the possibility or otherwise of the parties\n\n ever living together in case they are already living\n\n apart and all other relevant facts and circumstances.\n\n What is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty\n\n in another case and it has to be determined in each\n\n case keeping in view the facts and circumstances of\n\n that case. That apart, the accusations and allegations\n\n have to be scrutinized in the context in which they are\n\n made. Be it noted, in the said case, this Court quoted\n\n extensively from the allegations made in the written\n\n statement and the evidence brought on record and\n\n came to hold that the said allegations and counter\n\n allegations were not in the realm of ordinary plea of\n\n defence and did amount to mental cruelty.\n\n 28. \nIn \nPraveen Mehta v. Inderjit Mehta\n, (2002) 5\n\n SCC 706, it has been held that mental cruelty is a\n\n state of mind and feeling with one of the spouses due\n\n to behaviour or behavioural pattern by the other.\n\n Mental cruelty cannot be established by direct\n\n evidence and it is necessarily a matter of inference to\n\n be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the\n\n case. A feeling of anguish, disappointment, and\n\n frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of the\n\n other can only be appreciated on assessing the\n\n attending facts and circumstances in which the two\n\n partners of matrimonial life have been living. The facts\n\n and circumstances are to be assessed emerging from\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -10-\n\n the evidence on record and thereafter, a fair inference\n\n has to be drawn whether the Petitioner in the divorce\n\n petition has been subjected to mental cruelty due to\n\n the conduct of the other.\n\n \n29 In \nVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate v. Neela\n\n Vijaykumar Bhate\n (2003) 6 SCC 334, it has been\n\n opined that a conscious and deliberate statement\n\n levelled with pungency and that too placed on record,\n\n through the written statement, cannot be so lightly\n\n ignored or brushed aside.\n\n 30. \nIn \nA. Jayachandra v. Aneel Kaur\n, (2005) 2 SCC\n\n 22, it has been ruled that the question of mental\n\n cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms\n\n of marital ties of the particular society to which the\n\n parties belong, their social values, status and\n\n environment in which they live. If from the conduct of\n\n the spouse, it is established and/or an inference can\n\n legitimately be drawn that the treatment of the spouse\n\n is such that it causes an apprehension in the mind of\n\n the other spouse about his or her mental welfare, then\n\n the same would amount to cruelty. While dealing with\n\n the concept of mental cruelty, enquiry must begin as\n\n to the nature of cruel treatment and the impact of such\n\n treatment in the mind of the spouse.\n It has to be seen\n\n whether the conduct is such that no reasonable\n\n person would tolerate it.\n\n 31. \nIn \nVinita Saxena v. Pankaj Pandit\n, (2006) 3\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -11-\n\n SCC 778, it has been ruled that as to what constitutes\n\n mental cruelty for the purposes of \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n\n will not depend upon the numerical count of such\n\n incident or only on the continuous course of such\n\n conduct but one has to really go by the intensity,\n\n gravity and stigmatic impact of it when meted out\n\n even once and the deleterious effect of it on the\n\n mental attitude necessary for maintaining a conducive\n\n matrimonial home.\n\n 32. \nIn \nSamar Ghosh v. Jaya Ghosh\n, (2007) 4 SCC\n\n 511, this Court, after surveying the previous decisions\n\n and referring to the concept of cruelty, which includes\n\n mental cruelty, in English, American, Canadian and\n\n Australian cases, has observed that the human mind\n\n is extremely complex and human behaviour is equally\n\n complicated. Similarly, human ingenuity has no\n\n bound, therefore, to assimilate the entire human\n\n behaviour in one definition is almost impossible. What\n\n is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in the\n\n other case. The concept of cruelty differs from person\n\n to person depending upon his upbringing, level of\n\n sensitivity, educational, family and cultural\n\n background, financial position, social status, customs,\n\n traditions, religious belief, human values and their\n\n value system. Apart from this, the concept of mental\n\n cruelty cannot remain static; it is bound to change with\n\n the passage of time, impact of modern culture through\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -12-\n\n print and electronic media and value system, etc. etc.\n\n What may be mental cruelty now may not remain\n\n mental cruelty after a passage of time or vice versa.\n\n There can never be any straitjacket formula or fixed\n\n parameters for determining mental cruelty in\n\n matrimonial matters. The prudent and appropriate\n\n way to adjudicate the case would be to evaluate it on\n\n its peculiar facts and circumstances.\n\n 33. \nIn \nSuman Kapur v. Sudhir Kapur\n, (2009) 1 SCC\n\n 422, after referring to various decisions in the field,\n\n this Court took note of the fact that the wife had\n\n neglected to carry out the matrimonial obligations and\n\n further, during the pendency of the mediation\n\n proceeding, had sent a notice to the husband through\n\n her advocate alleging that he had another wife in USA\n\n whose identity was concealed. The said allegation\n\n was based on the fact that in his income-tax return,\n\n the husband mentioned the \"Social Security Number\"\n\n of his wife which did not belong to the wife, but to an\n\n American lady. The husband offered an explanation\n\n that it was merely a typographical error and nothing\n\n else. The High Court had observed that taking undue\n\n advantage of the error in the \"Social Security\n\n Number\", the wife had gone to the extent of making\n\n serious allegation that the husband had married an\n\n American woman whose \"Social Security Number\"\n\n was wrongly typed in the income-tax return of the\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -13-\n\n husband. This fact also weighed with this Court and\n\n was treated that the entire conduct of the wife did\n\n tantamount to mental cruelty.\"\n\n 9. \nIn \nK.Srinivas Rao\n's case (supra), similar view was taken.\n\n 10. A perusal of the record shows that the marriage of the\n\n appellant with the respondent was solemnized in the year 1992. No\n\n issue was born out of the wedlock. The appellant being a physically\n\n handicapped person, the respondent used to curse him. She never liked\n\n him. She even gave beating to him with lathi. From the very beginning,\n\n her attitude was not good towards the appellant and his family members.\n\n She always wanted to live in her parental house whenever the appellant\n\n was on training. She left the matrimonial home several times and on the\n\n efforts made by the appellant and his family members, she used to come\n\n back. She finally left the matrimonial home on 14.10.2000 and had\n\n deserted the husband. Further, her complaint under \nsections 498A\n, \n406\n,\n\n \n506\n IPC against the appellant and his family members was dismissed.\n\n \nEven appeal against the aforesaid order was also dismissed. Her\n\n complaint under \nsections 494\n/\n109\n IPC remained unsuccessful. The trial\n\n court thus was not right in dismissing the petition filed by the appellant\n\n husband. It has been authoritatively held by the Apex Court in \nK.\n\n Srinivas Rao\n's case (supra) and a Division Bench of this Court in\n\n \nImlesh v. Amit\n, AIR 2014 Punjab and Haryana 89 that where the wife\n\n files false criminal complaint against the husband and his family\n\n members under \nSections 406\n, \n498A\n of the Indian Penal Code which\n\n results in their acquittal, this act of the wife causes mental cruelty and\n\n the husband is entitled to a decree of divorce under \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n of\n\n the Act. Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, we\n\nGURBACHAN SINGH\n\n2015.02.05 12:14\n\nI attest to the accuracy and\n\nauthenticity of this document\n\nHigh Court Chandigarh\n\n FAO-M-347 of 2013 -14-\n\n do not find any ground to uphold the findings recorded by the trial court.\n\n As a result, we set aside the impugned judgment and decree dated\n\n 3.10.2013. The appeal filed by the appellant stands allowed.
