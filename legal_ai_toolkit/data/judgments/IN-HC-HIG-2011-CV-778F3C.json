JUSTICE S.RAVINDRA BHAT\n%\n\n1. This suit claimed a decree for possession and mesne profits. The plaintiffs, claimed to be\nowners of premises bearing No.14, N- Block Market, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi- 110 048\n(\"the suit premises\"), located on a 197 sq. yards plot consisting of a basement, ground floor,\nfirst floor and second floor, with a total covered area of approximately 4,200 sq. feet. The\nsuit alleges that the defendant was inducted as a tenant in the suit premises sometime in the\n1970‟s. From time to time the rent was increased, the last rent being ` 20,000/- per month.\nNo lease deed was executed for letting out the suit premises; the arrangement was a monthly\ntenancy, starting from the first day of each English calendar month and expiring on the last\nday.\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 1\n2. The suit alleges that by a registered post notice dated 10th May, 1995 sent on behalf of the\nplaintiffs, the tenancy was terminated with effect from the expiry of mid night of 30 th June,\n1995. The notice stated that if the defendant considered the tenancy month to be different\n(from the one stated in it), then the tenancy would stand terminated in June, 1995, on the\nexpiry of the day, which according to it was the last day of the tenancy month. By a letter\ndated 31.05.1995 the defendant responded to the notice contending that its tenancy was\nprotected under the\nDelhi Rent Control Act\n. The plaintiff‟s ownership of the premises, extent\nof tenancy premises, the monthly rent and the month to month nature of the tenancy was not\ndenied.\n3. The suit alleges that despite the notice, the defendant did not hand over vacant and\nphysical possession; the rent of the suit premises is more that ` 3,500/- per month. Therefore,\nthe Delhi Rent Control Act did not apply to the premises. It was alleged that on termination\nof the tenancy the defendant had no right, title or interest in the suit premises and as such the\nplaintiffs are entitled to recover the possession of the premises, as also mesne profits on\naccount of alleged wrongful, unauthorized and illegal use and occupation of the suit premises.\nIt is alleged that the rent of the premises was paid by the defendant at the rate of ` 20,000/-\nper month till 30th April, 1995. The defendant used to remit rent by way of a cheque for `\n16,000/- after deducting `4,000/- as TDS. However, for the month of May, 1995 the\ndefendant sent a cheque for ` 19,200/- along with a note to the effect that it represented a 10%\nincrease. The plaintiffs had not asked for or assented to an increase of rent nor was there any\nagreement providing for increase of rent. The suit alleges that sending of a cheque for a\nhigher amount was an attempt by the defendant to defeat the notice of termination. Since the\nsaid cheque was not for the correct amount it was not en-cashed by the plaintiffs. The rent for\nthe months of May and June, 1995 is in arrears. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs are entitled to a\ndecree for ` 40,000/- by way of arrears of rent. The plaintiff seeks mesne profits for the\nperiod 01.07.1995 to 31.08.1995 at ` 1,00,000/- per month which is the prevailing rate in the\narea at present and future mesne profits at the rate prevailing in the area at the time of disposal\nof the suit. The plaintiffs are further entitled to interest on the arrears of rent and mesne\nprofits @18% per annum at monthly rates.\n4. It is alleged that earlier the defendant was known as Fab India Overseas Pvt. Ltd.\nHowever, the defendant‟s recent correspondence bears the stamp of \"Fab India Overseas\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 2\nLtd.\" even though its letterheads continue to bear the name \"Fab India Overseas Pvt. Ltd.\"\nThe plaintiffs claim that the defendant has become a deemed Public Limited Company.\n5. During the pendency of the suit, the original plaintiff Shri S.N. Sheopuri died on\n06.01.1999. His share in the suit property devolved upon his elder daughter Mrs. Lakshmi\nDar who was brought on record in the proceedings. Mrs. Lakshmi Dar died on 04.09.2002;\nconsequently, her son and daughter Mr. Dhruv Dar and Mrs. Preeti Atal were brought on\nrecord in place of their deceased mother. By sale deed dated 21.10.2005 Mr. Dhruv Dar and\nMrs. Preeti Atal sold 50% share in the suit property to the defendant. consequently the second\nplaintiff and the defendant became co-owners of the suit property in equal shares. The sale\ndeed was signed on behalf of the defendant by Mr. H.K. Sibal, its authorized signatory and\nwas registered with Sub-Registrar on 21st October, 2005.\n6. During the pendency of the proceedings, defendant had filed an application under Order\n6 Rule 17 in which defendant inter alia averred that ―the plaintiff is not entitled to relief of\npossession against a co-owner of the property in the absence of seeking a partition by metes\nand bounds .......‖ .....―the plaintiff Smt. Janak Mushran is joint-owner of the suit property\nalong with defendant to the extent of 50% undivided share. Therefore, it is wrong to say that\nSmt. Janak Mushran is the owner and the landlord qua defendant in defendant in respect of\nthe suit property‖. In Para 10-B, of the suit, it is averred that in view of the aforesaid\ndevelopments, the plaintiff does not wish to keep her share in the suit property jointly with the\ndefendant and seeks partition. The plaintiff mentioned about co-ownership of the suit\nproperty with the defendant, by her, which was acknowledged in the Sale Deed of October 21,\n2005. The suit property is deemed to be in joint possession of both the parties, since\npossession of one co-owner is on behalf of the other co-owner as well. Therefore, the\nplaintiff is in joint possession of the suit property. It is further averred that the premises are\ncapable of partition by metes and bounds, evidenced from its site plan. A copy of the original\nsanction plan was annexed to the suit.\n7. To say that the property has great potential rental value, the plaintiff avers that it is tenant\nin a building immediately adjoining the suit property, viz No.13, N Block Market, Greater\nKailash-I, New Delhi. The defendant is a tenant in the basement and the ground floor of the\nsaid property at a rent of ` 4,00,000/- per month. That property was taken on rent by the\ndefendant by lease deed dated 23rd May, 2007 registered with the Sub Registrar, New Delhi at\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 3\nRegistration No.6358 at Additional Book No.1, Volume 7334, pages 157-172. It is also\nalleged that in the same market, the defendant is a tenant in occupation of premises bearing\nNo.N-9 and N-5, Greater Kailash-I (Market), New Delhi. The ground floor and first floor of\npremises bearing No.9, N Block Market, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi was leased by the\ndefendant by lease deed dated 14th June, 2002 at a monthly rent of ` 1,50,000/-. In addition,\ndefendant had also agreed to furnish an interest free security amount of ` 24 lakh. A certified\ncopy of the said lease deed is annexed with the suit. It is alleged, therefore, that the plaintiff\nis, therefore, entitled to rendition of accounts in terms of\nOrder 20 Rule 12 CPC\nfrom the\ndefendant for the period October 21, 2005 up to the date of handing over the possession of\nplaintiff‟s share of the property to her.\n8. The suit has been valued for purposes of court fee and jurisdiction. So far as the relief of\npossession is concerned, it has been fixed at ` 2,40,000/-. The value of the suit for the\npurpose of court fee and jurisdiction so far as the relief of possession is concerned is fixed at `\n40,000/-. The value of the suit for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction so far as the relief\nof mesne profits is concerned is fixed at ` 2,00,000/- being the mesne profits/damages for\nunauthorized use and occupation of the suit premises for the months of July and August,\n1995. The value of the suit for the purposes of court fees and jurisdiction for the relief of\npartition is fixed at ` 1 Crore for which a fixed court fee of ` 20/- is paid, since the plaintiff\nclaims to be in joint possession of the suit property.\n9. The defendant, in the amended written statement, contests the suit averments, and has\ndetailed the particulars regarding creation of alleged separate tenancies. It is alleged that the\nletting out of the ground floor portion was in 1970 and 1973 while the agreement creating a\ntenancy for the first floor was agreed in March, 1976, while the agreement creating a tenancy\nfor the basement, with effect from 01.04.1976. The separate tenancies created by late S.N.\nSheopuri were shown as follows:\n\n(a) One shop on ground floor w.e.f. 17.3.1990 at the agreed rate of ` 500/- per month and in\n1993, the rate of rent being ` 2400/- per month.\n(b) Another shop on the ground floor w.e.f. 21.11.1973 at the rate of ` 500/- per month and in\n1993, the rate of rent being ` 2400/- per month.\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 4\n(c) First floor with effect from February, 1975 at the agreed rate of ` 700/- per month and in\n1993, the rate of rent being ` 6600/- per month.\n(d) Basement with effect from 1.4.1976 at the agreed rate of ` 1200/- per month and in 1993,\nthe rate of rent being ` 2800/- per month.\n(e) Second floor with effect from 16.4.1976 at the agreed rate of ` 400/- per month and in\n1993, the rate of rent being ` 3900/- per month.\n(f) a sample Room on the ground floor w.e.f. 1.6.1976 at the agreed rent of ` 300/- per month\nand in 1993, the rate of rent being ` 1900/- per month.\n10. It is alleged that there are and always were six different tenancies and the rate of rent of\nfew tenancies was below ` 3500/- per month. Therefore, the defendant‟s tenancies are\ncovered under the Delhi Rent control Act for which the remedy is provided under that Act\nonly can be availed; the landlord has been vested with certain rights in terms of\nSection 14\nof\nthe Act for evicting his tenant. The defendants rely on\nSection 50\nof the Act, to contend that\nthis court lacks jurisdiction. The provision is as follows: -\n―Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, no civil court shall entertain any suit\nor proceedings in so far as it relates to the fixation of standard rent in relation to any\npremises to which this Act applies or to eviction of any tenant there from or any other\nmatter which the Controller is empowered by or under this Act to decide, and no\ninjunction in respect of any action taken or to be taken by the Controller under this Act\nshall be granted by any Civil Court or other Authority.‖\nIt is contended that the above bar is reinforced by\nSection 14\nwhich through sub- section (I)\n(a) to (l) provide legal remedies to a landlord for evicting his tenant. The present suit is\ntherefore barred.\n11. It is contended that the plaintiff‟s plea that the rate of rent is ` 20,000/- per month\nis misconceived because the documents on record contain the terms of tenancy and the rate of\nrent agreed by the parties at the commencement of the tenancy. Once the rate of rent is\nagreed between the parties, it cannot be enhanced or increased in view of the provision laid\ndown in\nSection 5\nof the Delhi Rent Control Act. The said provision reads as under: -\n(1) Subject to the provision of this Act, no person shall claim or receive any rent in excess of\nthe standard rent, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.\n(2) No person shall, in consideration of the grant, renewal or continuance of a tenancy or\nsub-tenancy or any premises -\n(a) claim or receive the payment of any sum as premium or pugree or claim or receive any\nconsideration whatsoever, in cash or in kind, in addition to the rent; or\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 5\n(b) except with the previous permission of the Controller, claim or receive the payment of\nany sum exceeding one month's rent of such premises as rent in advance. Since the aforesaid\nprovision of law prohibits a landlord to claim any rent other than the rent agreed, therefore,\nany amount received by the landlord more than that of the agreed rate of rent cannot bestow\nupon such landlord any legal right to perpetuate his illegal acts, which are contrary to the\nstatute.\n\nIt is thus contended that a contract or agreement whereby the landlord claims a sum of `\n20,000/- per month as rent is contrary to\nSection 5\nof the Act and is hit by the provisions of\n\nSection 23\nof the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\n12. It is stated that by reason of\nSections 6-A\nand\nSection 8\nof the Delhi Rent Control Act,\nthere cannot be any automatic revision in the rate of rent.\nSection 6-A\nof the Delhi Rent\nControl Act clearly stipulates that the agreed rate of rent can be increased by 10% every three\nyears subject to a legal notice in conformity with the provision of\nSection 8\nof the Delhi Rent\nControl Act and in the present case there have been no notice in accordance with the said\nprovision of law.\n13. The defendant argued that the present suit is also not maintainable as different tenancies\ncommenced on different dates containing different rates of rent, therefore they were based on\ndifferent causes of action and there cannot be joinder of those causes of action in a single suit.\nTherefore, the suit of the plaintiffs is also liable to be dismissed on this ground.\n14. It is alleged that the plaintiff knew that six different tenancies of the premises, were\ncreated by late S.N. Sheopuri as he was a co-owner of the property along with his daughter,\nSmt. Janak Mushran, the second plaintiff. S.N. Sheopuri expired in the year 1999; he had an\nundivided half share in the suit property which devolved upon his daughter, Smt. Laxmi Dar.\nOn her death in the year 2002, that undivided half-share devolved upon her legal heirs who\nsold that interest or undivided share, through a registered Sale deed dated 21.10.2005,\nregistered in the office of Sub Registrar concerned, New Delhi in favour of Fab India\nOverseas Pvt. Ltd., the defendant. Therefore, in terms of the sale deed dated 21.10.2005, the\ndefendant being the tenant of six different tenancies in various portions of the entire suit\nproperty, succeeded to the undivided share originally held by late S.N. Sheopuri to the extent\nof 50% along with Smt. Janak Mushran. The learned Additional District Judge, Delhi by\norder dated 26.11.2007 intimated the plaintiff that its suit for possession was not maintainable\nagainst the co-owner. The learned Judge, nowhere held that the defendant ceased to be the\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 6\ntenant in the property. The plaintiff did not challenge that order, dated on 26.11.2007 and\naccordingly the said court, by order dated 29.4.2008 amended and deleted certain issues, since\nthe plaintiff did not challenge the order dated 27.11.2007 despite being provided a number of\nopportunities. The plaintiff thereafter filed the present amended suit claiming partition,\npossession, arrears of rent, mesne profits and rendition of accounts, which is now presently\npending before this Court.\n15. The defendant contends that the suit in the present form is not maintainable, as there is no\nlegal heir of late S.N. Sheopuri in the present suit, because his share devolved upon M/s. Fab\nIndia Overseas Pvt. Ltd. Therefore, the suit, on this ground alone is liable to be dismissed.\n16. The defendant also argues that the suit is not properly valued for the purpose of court fee\nand jurisdiction, so much so the undivided half share of the suit property was sold on\n21.10.2005 for a sum of ` 2.50 crore (Rupees two crore and fifty lakh only) to M/s. Fab India\nOverseas Pvt. Ltd. while the plaintiff, Smt. Janak Mushran who claims to be a co-sharer of\nundivided half share has assessed its value at ` 1.00 crore. The plaintiff has thus under-\nvalued the suit property and the suit is, therefore, liable to be rejected under the provisions of\nOrder-VII, Rule-11 (c)\nCPC\n. It is alleged that the plaintiff has not paid the requisite ad-\nvalorem court fee on the plaint on the relief of possession as the plaintiff has never been in\npossession of any portion of the suit property as admitted in Para 2 of the plaint. Likewise, it\nis alleged that the present suit for rendition of accounts is not maintainable against the\ndefendant.\n17. The suit for the relief of mesne profits/damages for the period from 1.7.1995 onwards is\nbarred by the prescribed period of limitation and even otherwise is not tenable against a\nlawful tenant, whose tenancies are protected under the provisions of\nDelhi Rent Control Act\n.\n18. On 14.08.1997, issues were framed by the predecessor Court i.e. the learned Additional\nDistrict Judge. In view of later and subsequent developments whereby the undivided half\nshare was purchased by the defendant, which led to an application for withdrawal of the suit\nbeing filed by it (the defendant) and later the order being recalled, a further application for\namendment of the issues was made. That application under Order-XIV Rule-5\nCPC\nwas\nallowed by order dated 29.04.2008, which deleted issue No.7 (―whether the plaintiff is\nentitled to recovery of possession of suit premises? OPP‖) and modified issue no.3.\nConsequently, the issues in this suit framed as on 29.04.2008 read as follows: -\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 7\n1. Whether the plaintiff has concealed the material facts that the tenancy was governed by\n\nDRC Act\n; if so, its effect? OPD.\n2. Whether the tenancy for different portions was in different tenancy and same carried rent\nless than ` 3500/- p.m.? OPD.\n3. Whether the suit for recovery of rent and mesne profits is not maintainable in view of\nprovisions of\nSec.50\nDRC Act? OPD\n4. Whether this Court has no jurisdiction in view of\nSec.50\nDRC Act? OPD\n5. Whether the defendant is entitled to receive ` Two Lakhs from the plaintiff by way of\ncounter claim on account of excessive payment? OPD\n6. Whether the tenancy of the defendant has been validly terminated? OPP\n7. XXX XXX XXX (deleted by order dated 29.04.2008).\n8. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the amounts towards arrears/damages/mesne profits, as\nclaimed; if so how much and any interest, if so, at what rate? OPP\n9. Relief.\n19. The order by which original Issue no.7, i.e., the plaintiff‟s entitlement for recovery of\npossession of suit premises was deleted had noticed that the plaintiff had not moved any\napplication for amendment of the suit and the fact that the defendant had purchased 50%\nundivided share in the suit property. After that order, the plaintiff moved an application for\namendment of the suit which sought to incorporate a fresh relief i.e. claim for partition [relief\nclause (e)] and a claim for rendition of accounts [relief clause (f)]. The defendant resisted the\napplication and also filed a reply. After considering the rival submissions, the Court by its\norder dated 13th October, 2008, allowed the plaintiff‟s application and permitted the\namendments sought to incorporate the relief of partition and rendition of accounts w.e.f.\n21.10.2005. The plaintiff urges that in the light of this subsequent development, the Court is\nnot in any manner inhibited or constrained from making the appropriate orders to fulfil the\nends of justice which in the present case may extend to granting an appropriate partition\ndecree and also granting suitable mesne profits/decree for accounts.\n20. With the above background emerging from the pleadings, the Court now proposes to\ndiscuss the rival contentions and evidence of the parties having regard to the issues framed.\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 8\nISSUE NOS. 1 - 5\n\n21. The onus of proving these issues is upon the defendant. Learned counsel firstly argues\nthat the suit as framed is not maintainable because it does not anywhere claim the relief of\npossession as the required ad-valoram court fee has not been paid. It is submitted that the\nclear averments in the suit point to the plaintiff not being in possession of the premises or any\npart of it. Consequently by merely alleging that the plaintiff being the co-owner was in joint\npossession, the obligation to value the relief appropriately and to deposit the requisite court\nfee could not have been avoided. Learned counsel relied upon the judgment reported as\nNisheet Bhalla Vs. Malind Raj Bhalla & Ors., AIR 2007 Delhi 60. It was further argued that\nthe suit originally incorporated the claim for possession; even an issue had been framed (Issue\nNo.7). By virtue of subsequent developments such as the death of one of the original co-\nowners, development of his interest upon his heirs, sale of 50% of the interest in the suit\npremises to the defendant etc., the Court amended the issues, deleted the reference to\nplaintiff‟s claim for possession (issue No.7). That order has become final. The mere\nincorporation of relief claiming partition would not in any manner result in the plaintiff being\nentitled to relief of possession.\n22. It was argued that the plaintiff‟s omission to amend the suit and seek the consequential\nrelief of possession (which had already stood deleted by a previous order) has resulted in\nrendering the suit untenable. This is because the plaintiff has not sought the most appropriate\nrelief despite being in possession which precludes adjudication of the suit in its present form.\nReliance was placed upon the decision of the Calcutta High Court reported in as Ghulam\nMohiuddin Vs The Official Assignee & Ors., AIR 1978 Cal 463; and of the Punjab High\nCourt in S.Bhagat Singh Vs. Satpal Transport Co. Ltd. & Ors. AIR 1961 Punj 278. It was\nurged that in these two decisions the Courts had ruled that even after giving an opportunity to\nthe plaintiff to amend the suit, he fails to avail it by incorporating suitable and appropriate\nrelief, the Court has to dismiss the suit.\n23. Learned counsel relied upon the provisions of\nSections 5\nand\nof the Delhi Rent\nControl Act and urged that the facts established on the record ought to impel the court to\ndismiss the suit as it is devoid of jurisdiction. It was argued that the most relevant material as\nwell as the pleadings clearly point out that at no stage did the parties intend the creation of a\nsingle indivisible tenancy at the monthly rent, which was in excess of Rs.3500/-. Learned\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 9\ncounsel relied upon the averments in the written statement and submitted that the tenancies\nwere created in respect of six different premises at entirely different points of time. In each\ninstance, the agreed rent was different and pertained to the tenancy for which the parties\nentered into the contract or understanding. Reliance was placed in this regard upon Ex.\nPW1/D-2 i.e. late Mr. Sheopuri„s letter acknowledging increase of rent in respect of premises\ndated 3rd December, 1975, Ex. PW-1/D-3 dated 28th April, 1978, Ex. DW-7/2 letter dated 21st\nNovember, 1973 written by defendant No.2 to the plaintiff enclosing the rent in respect of a\nportion of M-14 Greater Kailash, which was taken over on 15th November, 1973; Ex. DW-7/3\na letter dated 5th February, 1974 written by late Mr. Sheopuri stating that the first floor of\npremises M-14 was leased out for commercial rental for a period of three years and enclosing\nthe existing fittings etc., Ex.DW-7/4 a letter evidencing leasing of the ground floor of the\npremises for a monthly rental of Rs.1200/-.\n24. It is argued that a conspectus of the documentary material clearly discloses that the\nfollowing tenancies were created :\n(a) At different times\n(b) For different premises\n(c) At different rates of rent\n\nTherefore, in the absence of a mutual agreement between the parties consolidating all the\ntenancies, or in the absence of the lessee vacating the premises and the Lessor demising all of\nthem through one common lease deed, there cannot be any straight jacket formula that the\namounts paid to the plaintiff were on account of single, composite or indivisible lease.\nThough the parties did not enter into any written contract or agreement, the Court cannot\noverlook the circumstances under which the tenancies were created by mutual understanding.\nIf this aspect were to be kept in kind, the present suit premised on the averments that all the\narrangements were consolidated in one suit in respect of a single premises is untenable and\nthe Court lacks jurisdiction.\n\n25. It was argued that if the true intent of the contesting parties was to create separate\ntenancies which have been acted upon, as is evident from the various letters exchanged by\nthem most of tenancies were for less than ` 3500/- p.m. Therefore, the suit, drawn on the\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 10\npleading that the entire premise was leased out on a rent in excess of ` 3500/- is not\nmaintainable because of\nSection 50\nof Delhi Rent Control Act.\n26. It is contended the defendant being a tenant under six different tenancies in the suit\nproperty, the suit for partition, possession, arrears of rent, mesne profits and rendition of\naccounts against it is not maintainable in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court of\nIndia in the cases of M/s. India Umbrella Manufacturing Company & Ors. v. Bhagabandei\nAgarwalla 2004 (3) SCC 178 and Pramod Kumar Jaiswal v. Bibi Husn Bano & Ors. 2005 (5)\nSCC 492.\n27. Learned counsel submits that the present suit for the relief of possession without the\nconsent of co-owner (Fab India Overseas Ltd.) is untenable in terms of the law declared by\nthe Supreme Court of India in the case of S.K. Sattar S.K. Mohd Choudhari v. Gundappa\nAmbadas Bukate 1996 (6) SCC 373.\n28. The plaintiff‟s counsel argues that the suit is maintainable, and not barred under\nprovisions of the\nDelhi Rent Control Act\n. It is submitted that a plain reading of the\ndocuments, particularly Ex. DW-7/P-11 to Ex. PW. DW-7/P-33 proved that at all material\ntimes, the defendant treated the tenancy as single and indivisible. It is argued that all these\ndocuments reveal that during the period 1995-1995, and even in 1986, rents used to be paid\nthrough one cheque, and even the covering letters for the relative periods indicated that there\nwas one tenancy, and not that the defendant consolidated the rental amounts for the facility of\nconvenience, as it contends in the present suit.\n29. The plaintiff‟s counsel next contended that the plea of six tenancies was taken by the\ndefendant, in its first amended written statement, for the first time, and that such a pleading\nhad not been made in the original written statement placed on the record. It was submitted that\nthis clearly amounted to a binding admission (in the original written statement) which could\nnot be resiled from; and so the defendant was estopped by the pleadings from contending\nanything contrary to the admission (regarding the plaintiff‟s plea of a single tenancy, made in\nthe suit).\n30. The plaintiff‟s counsel contends that the tabular statements relied upon by the defendant\nto say that different rates of rent were agreed upon by the parties, and paid (to the plaintiff), in\nsupport of the submission regarding subsistence of different tenancies, is not admissible,\nbecause it is not supported by any documentary evidence. It is submitted that the books of\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 11\naccount which a company has to maintain and the manner they have to be kept, is prescribed\nby\nSection 209\nof the Companies Act. The defendant has not produced any such document or\nprimary material in the form of ledger account, etc., which can be considered as reliable, and\ncontemporaneous. Therefore, the contention regarding subsistence of separate tenancies has to\nfail.\n31. The plaintiff contends that in the present case, even though tenancies were entered into in\nrespect of different portions of the suit property at various points in time, the overwhelming\nevidence, established through conduct of the parties, disclosed their intention to treat the\ntenancy as a single one. The premises were part of the same suit property; the lessor and\nlessee were identical, and there was no written agreement in respect of the transaction. It is\nsubmitted that the plea by the defendant that M/s Fab India USA was the tenant, and that it\n(the defendant) was not the tenant, is untenable, because:\ni) There were six tenancies between the plaintiffs and Fabindia Inc;\n\nii). There was only a change in name of Fabindia Inc. to Fabindia Overseas Pvt. Ltd.\n\niii). By virtue of agreement between Fabindia Inc. & Fabindia Overseas the tenancy rights\ncame to vest in the defendant and thus the defendant became successor in interest of Fabindia\nInc. with the alleged old tenancies continuing in favour of the defendant;\n\niv.) The plaintiff assented to the vesting of tenancy rights of Fabindia Inc. in Fabindia\nOverseas.\n\nThe pleaded case in all the four written statements filed by the defendant was that it was a\ntenant since 1970 (a patent untruth established by the Certificate of Incorporation of the\ndefendant which shows that it was incorporated in December 1976). At no point of time was\nit pleaded that the defendant was a successor in interest of Fabindia Inc. Rather the\nsuggestion given by the defendant to PW 1 during cross examination was that Fabindia Inc.\nwas never a tenant, as is evident from the cross examination of PW 1 that ―It is wrong to\nsuggest that Fabindia Inc. was never a tenant.‖\n\n32. The plaintiff relies on Ext. PW-1/D1 dated 17.3.1970, Ext. PW-1/D2 dated 3.12.1975,\nExt. DW-7/2 letter dated 21.11.1973, Ext. DW-7/3 dated 5.2.1974, Ext. DW-7/4 letter dated\n11.11.1975 and Ext. PW-1/D2 letter dated 3.12.1975. The plaintiff further relies on the\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 12\ncorrespondence between the parties and submits that all that it shows is that different portions\nof the premises were let out to Fabindia Inc. at different points in time at different rates of\nrent. It is submitted that assuming that there were six tenancies in favour of Fabindia Inc. that\ncannot lead to a presumption that there were six tenancies as between the plaintiffs and the\ndefendant. Assuming such a presumption can be raised, the same stands rebutted by:\ni. the conduct of the parties, especially of the defendant of sending one rental cheque;\nii. documents exhibited as Ex. PW 1/6, Ex. PW7/1-33 all of which emanate from the\ndefendant;\niii. the failure of the defendant to produce even one document from its records whether in the\nshape of account books, vouchers, letters etc. relating to the period 1977 to 1996.\n\n33. The plaintiff also submitted that the defendant‟s letter dated 2.5.1986 (Ex. Pw-7/33)\nrefers to a single tenancy and the rent as ` 9,000/-. This rent was accepted by the plaintiffs.\nThe defendant is estopped from contending the contrary. It was argued that a single tenancy\nwas admitted in letter dated 31.5.1995 in reply to notice of termination (Ex. PW-1/6). The\nnotice of termination referred to a single tenancy. Had there been six tenancies, the first\nresponse of the defendant would have been to assert the claim of six tenancies, not to be\nreferred to as a single „tenancy‟, as was done in the reply. It was further argued that had there\nbeen multiple tenancies, the same would have been reflected in the books of the defendant‟s\naccounts; more so, in view of\nSection 209 (1)(a)\nof the Companies Act which enjoins upon a\ncompany to maintain books of account regarding `matters in respect of which receipt and\nexpenditure takes place‟. In this context, it is pointed out that DW-7 admitted that the\ndefendant was not maintaining any file, record or notings in respect of the rent of the alleged\nseparate tenancies. The relevant portion of the statement relied on is as follows:\n\n―It was only for the sake of convenience that the tenant and landlord\ndecided that instead of six separate cheques let there be one cheque only as our\norganization was and is managed by ladies so we wanted to minimize the paper\nand book writing work...\nI do not think that I had seen any internal document in our office in which it had\nbeen stated in writing that one cheque was to b issued for the sake of convenience.\nThe same is true when Fabindia inc. was the tenant.....\nEven after the incorporation of the deft. Company these persons were\ndealing with the landlord as detailed above. I do not remember that whether we\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 13\nhad informed the landlord after the incorporation of the present deft. Company in\nwriting that there were six tenancies and not one tenancy (Vol. we had verbally\ndiscussed the same with the landlord after the incorporation of the present deft.\nCompany)....\nThe increase was discussed with the landlord and thereafter Kacha\nVoucher were being prepared but ultimately the increase would be reflected for\nthe books of accounts. We are not maintaining any separate file or record, noting\ndown such periodical increase in the rent of separate petitions.‖\nThe explanation of \"convenience\" and the defendant being \"managed by ladies\" made on its\nbehalf, it is submitted, besides being incorrect was not pleaded. It was advanced for the first\ntime during deposition. A plea of convenience contrary to the statutory requirement (\nSection\nof the Companies Act) ought not to be accepted.\n\n34. Dealing with the issue of insufficient court fee, the plaintiff argues that the plea is\nuntenable. Reliance is placed on Neelavathi Vs. N.Natrajan (AIR 1980 SC 691) where it was\nheld by the Supreme Court that the question of the court fee must be considered in the light of\nthe allegations made in the plaint and its decision cannot be influenced either by the pleas in\nthe written statement or by the final decision of the suit on merits, and that in the case of co-\nowners, the possession of one is in law possession of law the other, unless ouster or exclusion\nis proved. The court also held that to continue to be in joint possession in law, it is not\nnecessary that the plaintiff should be in actual possession of the whole or part of the property.\n\n35. Dealing with the objection that the suit is not maintainable, in view of the development of\n2002, whereby the heirs of S.N. Sheopuri sold their half undivided share to the defendant, it is\nargued that the plea proceeds on a misconception as to the concept of partition. A claim for\npartition has two limbs, separation of shares and placing parties in possession of their\nrespective shares. Thus relief of possession is implicit in the claim for partition. For this,\nreliance is placed on the judgment reported as Shub Karant Bubina Vs. Sita Saran Bubna\n(2009 (12) SCALE 209, where the Court observed as follows:\n\n―4. `Partition' is a re-distribution or adjustment of pre-existing rights, among co-\nowners/coparceners, resulting in a division of lands or other properties jointly\nheld by them, into different lots or portions and delivery thereof to the respective\nallottees..... In a suit for partition the prayer is not only for declaration in the suit\nproperties, but also division by metes and bounds......‖\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 14\n―5. In a suit is for partition or separation of a share, the court at the first stage\ndecides whether the plaintiff has a share in the suit property and whether he is\nentitled to division and separate possession. The decision on these two issues is\nexercise of a judicial function and results in first stage decision termed as\n`decree' under Order 20 Rule 18(1) and termed as `preliminary decree' under\nOrder 20 Rule 18(2) of the Code.‖\nTo a similar effect is the ruling in Ramagoda Vs. Lagmavva (AIR 1985 Karn 82) is relied on,\nwhere it was held that:\n\n\"10. Under S, 54 and O.20, R. 18,\nC.P.C\n., the only duty of the Collector, now\ncalled as the Deputy Commissioner, is to effect partition or division by metes and\nbounds in accordance with law, if any for the time being in force, relating to\npartition or separate possession of shares of such estate. The word 'partition'\nused in\nS. 54\nor O.20; R. 18, in my opinion, means that the partition is not\nconfined to mere division of the lands concerned into the requisite parts, but also\nincludes the delivery of shares to the respective allottees. To elaborate further, the\nword 'partition' means actual division or partition by metes and bounds and\nhanding over possession of the shares to the parties.‖\n\n36. The first question which the court has to decide is whether there was a single tenancy, as\nis asserted by the plaintiff, or whether there were multiple tenancies, as is urged on behalf of\nthe defendant. The facts which emerge from the pleadings and the evidence are that different\nportions of the premises were let out for different monthly rents. The common feature\namongst these, however, was:\n\n(1) All the portions were part of the same property, i.e. the suit premises.\n\n(2) There was no instrument, or registered deed, creating the lease or leases in respect the\npremises.\n\n(3) The evidence shows that over a long period, the defendant used to pay a single amount\ntowards rent; even the tax deduction at source, was based on a single payment.\n\n(4) The reference in the letters written to the plaintiff by the defendant, enclosing the rent,\nwas towards rent for the premises.\n\n(5) The tenant was common, i.e. the defendant. Initially, the arrangement was with Fab India\nInc. Later, the tenancy was, on a reading of the materials on record, changed in favour of Fab\nIndia Overseas Pvt. Ltd, in 1976. The agreement Ex. DW 7/6 between the two said\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 15\ncompanies. Ex. DW 6/4 and Ex. DW 6/5 also show that Fabindia Inc. was a shareholder in\nFabindia Overseas Pvt. Ltd. This establishes that the two were separate entities. However, the\ntenancy was assigned or devolved in favour of the defendant company.\n\n37. The first decision on the question of whether an arrangement between the landlord and\ntenant constitutes a single, indivisible contract (of tenancy) or it has to be seen as separate\ntransactions, in the context of a plea by the tenant, under the\nDelhi and Ajmer Rent Control\nAct\n, the Supreme Court, in S. Sanyal v. Gian Chand AIR 1968 SC 438 held that unless the\nlaw provides otherwise, a single tenancy cannot be split into several ones by the court. In\nHiralal Kapur v. Prabhu Choudhury, (1988) 2 SCC 172, the court had to consider whether\npayment of rents for separate portions, by separate individuals, at the consent of the landlord,\nwhere the initial tenancy was single, constituted separate contracts. The court held that:\n― We are inclined to agree with this submission of the landlord. The initial\ntenancy was only an oral tenancy. Nevertheless there were two witnesses who\ndeposed that the original tenancy agreement was only between the petitioner and\nthe respondent. At that time, admittedly, there was no question of Balkunj being\n\nthe tenant in respect of any portion of the premises. All that the respondent says is\nthat subsequently cheques were being issued in the name of Balkunj also and that\nthis must be taken to lead to an inference that the petitioner had accepted Balkunj\nas its tenant. It is very difficult to accept this argument. It is no doubt true that the\nrent has been paid by two cheques since November 1976 but the mere payment of\nrent by two cheques, in the circumstances of this case, cannot mean that there\nwere two tenancies. The landlord was entitled to a rent of Rs 600 p.m. and so long\nas he got this amount, it was immaterial for him whether the amount was paid in\na lump sum or by one cheque or more than one cheque and who the makers of the\ncheques were. It is not unusual to come across cases where a tenant pays the rent\nnot by a cheque drawn by himself but by a cheque drawn by some other concern\nin which he has an interest such as a partnership concern, a limited company or\nother entity in which he is interested. So, the mere fact that for some reason the\nrespondent chose not to issue a single cheque for the rent of Rs 600/- but that he\ngave two separate cheques, one for Rs 250 drawn by himself and one for Rs 350/-\ndrawn in the name of Balkunj cannot lead to an irresistible conclusion that the\ntenancy was created in favour of Balkunj with the concurrence of the landlord.\nThe letter dated November 26, 1978, far from ―clinching‖ the respondent's claim,\nas held by the High Court, does not in our view improve the tenant's case at all. It\nonly evidences the fact that the landlord was receiving the cheques issued in the\nname of the trust in discharge of the respondent's obligation to pay the rent of Rs\n600 p.m. It is also true that, since the landlord was also occupying a part of the\nground floor premises, he might have been aware that certain activities of\nBalkunj were being carried on in the hall. But this can only mean that the\nlandlord permitted the tenant to use a portion of the premises let out for running\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 16\nthe activities of the trust. Even assuming that, standing by themselves these two\nfacts might have been sufficient to draw any such inference as is suggested the\ntwo letters of August 5, 1977 and January 15, 1978 place the matter beyond all\ndoubt. The landlord categorically asserted in these letters that he does not\nrecognize Balkunj as his tenant and that the respondent alone was his tenant.\nThere was no reply to these letters from the respondent. In these circumstances\nthere can be no doubt at all that the premises had been let out only to the\nrespondent by the petitioner and that Balkunj cannot be considered to be a tenant\nof the premises or any portion thereof.\n\n8. The finding of the Rent Controller that there was only a single tenancy was\nessentially a finding of fact based on the material and circumstances to which we\nhave adverted and we are also inclined to accept the conclusion of the Rent\nController as the correct one.‖\n\nSimilarly, in\nPanjumal Daulatram v. Sakhi Gopal\n, (1977) 3 SCC 284, it was held that whether\nthe lease was a composite one, or for different purposes, and had to be treated as separate\nleases, was a question of fact, and the court could not treat a single transaction into separate\nones:\n\n―The residential portion is a part of the building and is an accommodation by\ndefinition. The non-residential portion is also a part of the building and is an\naccommodation by definition. The lease has been given for residential as well as\nnon-residential purposes. The landlord is entitled to eviction of the residential\nportion if he makes out a bona fide residential requirement. Likewise he is entitled\nto eviction of the non-residential portion which is an accommodation if he makes\nout a non-residential requirement. We have already found that The final court of\nfact, affirmed by the High Court, has found in favour of the landlord regarding\nhis residential as well as non-residential requirements. Therefore, nothing more\ncan be done in defence of the tenant in the light of the present law.\n\n5. Counsel contended that in a decision of this Court viz.\nS. Sanyal v. Gian\nChand1\nit has been held that it is not permissible for the Court to split up a\ncontract in an eviction proceeding. We agree. There is no question of splitting up\nof the contract in the present case, as is abundantly plain from what we have\nstated. The contract was integral but had dual purposes. The landlord has put\nforward dual requirements which neatly fit into\nSection 12(1)(e)\nand (f).\n\nThe\nconsequence is inevitable that the eviction order has to be upheld.‖\n\nAn identical approach was accepted and applied by the Supreme Court, in\nHabibunnisa\nBegum v. G. Doraikannu Chettiar\n, (2000) 1 SCC 74, where the court, referring to its previous\njudgment, in\nS. Sanyal\n's case (supra) held that:\n\n―In S. Sanyal v. Gian Chand\nit was held that where a contract of tenancy was a\nsingle indivisible contract and in the absence of any statutory provision to that\neffect, it is not open to the court to split the tenancy. Law, therefore, is that where\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 17\nthere is a single indivisible contract of tenancy, it cannot be split by a court unless\nthere is a statutory provision to that effect. In the present case it is not disputed\nthat the contract of tenancy is a single indivisible contract for Doors Nos.\n27 and\n\n28. It is also not disputed that there is no provision in the\nTamil Nadu Buildings\n(Lease and Rent Control) Act\nempowering the court to order partial ejectment of\na tenant from the premises by splitting the single indivisible tenancy. For these\nreasons it was not open to the High Court to split the tenancy and order for\npartial ejectment of the tenant from the premises.‖\n\n38. The evidence, in this case, in the form of Ex. PW 1/6, Ex. DW7/1 to DW-7/33 shows that\ncommon rent amounts were consistently paid by the defendant, with a single tax deduction at\nsource, disclosed by it. The defendant has not produced separate rent receipts in respect of the\nsix different portions of the premises, for any period, or even one month. It has also not\nplaced on record any documentary evidence, in the form of ledger extracts or books of its\naccounts, showing that though a common amount was paid, in its books the amounts were\nmaintained as rents for separate premises, so as to establish its case for separate tenancies, to\ntake the case out of the purview of the civil court. The legal position in this regard appears to\nbe that even if a property or \"accommodation\" is let out for two different purposes (i.e.\nresidential and commercial) the courts would not be justified in splitting the tenancy and\ncreating separate transactions, unless permitted by law. In Hiralal Kapur (supra) the Supreme\nCourt went so far as to say that if portions of the premises are occupied by separate\nindividuals with the approval of the landlord, who receives amounts separately from each of\nthem, as long as the original tenancy was created by one of them, for the whole premises, and\na portion was later occupied by another person, at the recommendation of the original tenant,\nthe law would recognize one tenancy between the landlord and the original tenant, and the\ncourt cannot split the tenancy. Having regard to these decisions, and upon an analysis of the\nfacts of this case, it is held that regardless of the fact that originally, one premise was let out in\nfavour of the defendant, who was given possession of different portions later, the conduct and\nintention of the parties (whose relationship in respect of all the premises, was common, and\nall the premises being part of the same suit property) was to create a single indivisible\ntenancy, the rent for which was ` 20,000/-.\n\n39.\nSection 3\nof the Delhi Rent Control Act reads as follows:\n\n―3. Act not to apply to certain premises: Nothing in this Act shall apply;\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 18\n\n(a) to any premises belonging to the Government;\n\n(b) to any tenancy or other like relationship created by a grant from the Government in\nrespect of the premises taken on lease, or requisitioned, by the Government :\n\nProvided that where any premises belonging to Government have been or are lawfully let by\nany person by virtue of an agreement with the Government or otherwise, then,\nnotwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or other authority, the provisions\nof this Act shall apply to such tenancy.\n\n(c) to any premises, whether residential or not, whose monthly rent exceeds three thousand\nand five hundred rupees...‖\n\nThe judgment in\nD.C. Bhatia v Union of India\n1995 (1) SCC 104 upheld the validity of the\n\nSection 3(c)\nwhich has the effect of excluding, from the purview of the\nDelhi Rent Control\nAct\n, premises and accommodation, the monthly rent of which exceeds ` 3500/-. In this case,\nthe monthly rent was ` 20,000/-. For these reasons, it is held that the objection to jurisdiction\nof this court, based on provisions of the\nDelhi Rent Control Act\n, is unfounded.\n\n40. The defendant‟s plea about insufficiency of court fee is primarily based on the argument\nthat the plaintiff is not in possession, and therefore, the relief has to be suitably valued, and\nad-valorem court fee, paid. The plaintiff has relied on the judgment in Neelavathi, where the\nchoice of the plaintiff, in valuing the suit, when partition is claimed, was explained in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n―The general principle of law is that in the case of co-owners, possession of one\nis possession of all unless ouster or exclusion is proved. To continue to be in joint\npossession in law it is not necessary that the plaintiff should be in actual\npossession of the whole or part of the property. Equally it is not necessary that he\nshould be getting a share or some income from the property. So long as his right\nto a share and the nature of the property is not disputed, the law presumes that he\nis in joint possession. To apply\nS. 37(1)\nthere should be a clear and specific\naverment in the plaint that Plaintiff has been excluded from joint possession. An\naverment that remain in joint possession would not amount to exclusion from\npossession.\"\n\nA similar view was expressed in M/s. Commercial Aviation and Travel Company and others\nv. Mrs. Vimla Pannalal (AIR 1988 SC 1636).\nEarlier, in a five judge ruling, in\nS. Rm. Ar. S.\nSp. Sathappa Chettiar V. S. Rm. Ar. Rm. Ramanathan Chettiar\nAIR 1958 SC 245, the\nSupreme Court held as follows:\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 19\n―...it would be clear that the conversion of the plaintiff's alleged undivided share\nin the joint family property into his separate share cannot be easily valued in\nterms of rupees with any precision or definiteness. That is why legislature has left\nit to the option of the plaintiff to value his claim for the payment of court-fees. It\nreally means that in suits falling under\nS. 7(iv)(b)\nthe amount stated by the\nplaintiff as the value of his claim for partition has ordinarily to be accepted by the\ncourt in computing the court-fees payable in respect of the said relief.‖\nIn view of the above settled legal position, the court finds that the suit is not defective or\nbarred for having insufficient valuation, or that adequate court fee was not paid.\n\n41. The court now proposes to consider the objection to maintainability of the suit on the\nground that the defendant is a co-owner in possession, and the issue regarding possession (No.\n\n7) having been struck off, the plaintiff cannot seek that relief. It is also urged that in the\nabsence of the original co-owner‟s heirs, as co-plaintiffs, the suit is defective, and that the\ndefendant cannot now be evicted due to its changed status as an undivided co-owner of the\nproperty.\n\n42. The doctrine of merger of a lower interest with a higher interest (mortgagee becoming the\nowner; lessee becoming owner, etc) is well known in property law. Situations where tenants\nacquire part interest in the tenanted property, during pendency of a civil suit, have occurred on\na number of occasions, as reported decisions testify.\nIn one of the earliest decisions,\nBadri\nNarain Jha v. Rameshwar Dayal Singh\nAIR 1951 SC 186, a five Judge Bench of the Supreme\nCourt held that:\n\n―If the lessor purchases the lessee's interest, the lease no doubt is extinguished as\nthe same man cannot at the same time be both a landlord and a tenant, but there\nis no extinction of the lease if one of the several lessees purchases only a part of\nthe lessor's interest‖\nIn\nIndia Umbrella Mfg. Co. v. Bhagabandei Agarwalla\n, (2004) 3 SCC 178, the Supreme\nCourt held that:\n\n―....It is well settled that one of the co-owners can file a suit for eviction of a\ntenant in the property generally owned by the co-owners. (See\nSri Ram Pasricha\nv. Jagannath1\nand\nDhannalal v. Kalawatibai2\n, SCC para 25.) This principle is\nbased on the doctrine of agency. One co-owner filing a suit for eviction against\nthe tenant does so on his own behalf in his own right and as an agent of the other\nco-owners. The consent of other co-owners is assumed as taken unless it is shown\nthat the other co-owners were not agreeable to eject the tenant and the suit was\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 20\nfiled in spite of their disagreement. In the present case, the suit was filed by both\nthe co-owners. One of the co-owners cannot withdraw his consent midway the suit\nso as to prejudice the other co-owner. The suit once filed, the rights of the parties\nstand crystallised on the date of the suit and the entitlement of the co-owners to\nseek ejectment must be adjudged by reference to the date of institution of the suit;\nthe only exception being when by virtue of a subsequent event the entitlement of\nthe body of co-owners to eject the tenant comes to an end by act of parties or by\noperation of law.\n\n7. Buchi Devi had willingly joined with Bhagabandei in filing the suit. During the\ncontinuity of litigation she parted with her share in the property. One out of the\ntwo tenants purchased her share. It seems that the tenancy is in the name of a\npartnership firm and some of the partners have purchased the share of Buchi\nDevi. It is not clear if all the partners or only a few out of all the partners are the\nbuyers. The fact remains that they have purchased only a share in the property\nand not the entire property. The applicability of the doctrine of merger within the\nmeaning of clause (d) of\nSection 111\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is not\nattracted. In order to bring the tenancy to an end the merger should be complete\ni.e. the interest of the landlord in its entirety must come to vest and merge into the\ninterest of the tenant in its entirety. When part of the interest of the landlord or\nthe interest of one out of many co-landlords-cum-co-owners comes to vest in the\ntenant, there is no merger and the tenancy is not extinguished.‖\n\n43.\nIn\nPramod Kumar Jaiswal v. Bibi Husn Bano\n, (2005) 5 SCC 492, the Supreme Court\nelaborated the position further, through a 3 judge Bench, on an interpretation of\nSection 111\n\nof the Transfer of Property Act, in the following terms:\n\n―111. Determination of lease.--A lease of immovable property, determines--\n\n(a)-(c) * * *\n\n(d) in case the interests of the lessee and the lessor in the whole of the property become vested\nat the same time in one person in the same right;\n\n(e)-(g) * * *‖\nOn a plain reading of the provision, it is clear that in a case where a tenant takes an\nassignment of the rights of the landlord or the reversion, the lease is determined only in a\ncase where by such assignment, the interests of the lessee and the lessor in the whole of the\nproperty, become vested in the tenant. The emphasis in the section is clearly on the coalescing\nof the entire rights of the lessor and the lessee in the whole of the property in the hands of the\nlessee. The above provision incorporates the doctrine of merger at common law. According to\nBlackstone (as quoted in Broom's Legal Maxims)\n―when a less estate and a greater estate, limited subsequent to it, coincide and meet in one\nand the same person without any intermediate estate, the less is immediately annihilated; or\nin the law phraseology is said to be merged, that is sunk or drowned in the greater; or to\nexpress the same thing in other words, the greater estate is accelerated so as to become at\nonce an estate in possession‖.\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 21\nIn Cheshire and Burn's Modern Law of Real Property, 16th Edn., it is stated,\n―The term ‗merger' means that, where a lesser and a greater estate in the same land\ncome together and vest, without any intermediate estate, in the same person and in the\nsame right, the lesser is immediately annihilated by operation of law. It is said to be\n‗merged', that is, sunk or drowned, in the greater estate.‖\n\nIt is further stated:\n\n―The essentials are that the estates shall unite in the same person without any intervening\nestate, and that the person in whom they unite shall hold them both in the same right.\nTo illustrate the first essential, if A, who is tenant for life, with remainder to B for life,\nremainder to C in fee, purchases and takes a conveyance of C's fee, the intervening life\ninterest of B, since it is vested, excludes the possibility of merger.‖ (see p. 993)\n\nIn Megarry's Manual of the Law of Real Property, 8th Edn., it is explained as follows:\n\n―Merger is the counterpart of surrender. Under a surrender, the landlord acquires the\nlease, whereas merger is the consequence of the tenant retaining the lease and acquiring\nthe reversion, or of a third party acquiring both lease and reversion. The principle is the\nsame in both surrender and merger: the lease is absorbed by the reversion and\ndestroyed.\n\nFor merger to be effective, the lease and the reversion must be vested in the same person\nin the same right with no vested estate intervening.‖\n\nThis is based on the principle that a man cannot be a lessee of himself. The House of\nLords in Rye v. Rye5 said that a person cannot grant himself a lease of the land of which\nhe is the owner. According to Woodfall on Landlord and Tenant:\n\n―It may be laid down as a general rule that whenever the particular estate and that\nimmediately in reversion are both legal or both equitable, and by any act or event\nsubsequent to the creation of the particular estate become for the first time vested in one\nperson in the same right, their separate existence will cease and a merger will take\nplace.‖\n\nAn extinguishment of a tenancy by merger is thus a counterpart of surrender by the\ntenant to the landlord.\nIn\nPuran Chand v. Kirpal Singh\nthis Court stated that a landlord\ncould not become his own tenant and\n―[w]hen a landlord transfers his rights in the leased property to his tenant there would\nbe a merger of the rights of the tenant in his higher rights as owner and the tenancy\nwould come to an end under\nSection 111(d)\nof the Transfer of Property Act‖. (SCC p.\n440, para 19).\n\n6. Thus, the ingredients are that two immediate estates should come into the hands of the\nsame person at the same time and it must be rights in the whole of the property. A merger\nis prevented if there is an intermediate estate outstanding with another at the relevant\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 22\ntime. Obviously, the taking of an assignment of a fraction of the reversion, or the rights of\na co-owner landlord, does not and cannot bring about a determination of the lease in\nterms of\nSection 111(d)\nof the Transfer of Property Act. That a lease is not extinguished\nbecause the lessee purchases a part of the reversion was\nlaid down by\nthe Privy Council\nin\nSk. Faqir Bakhsh v. Murli Dhar\n. Their Lordships after setting out the terms of\nSection\nof the Transfer of Property Act quoted with approval (at IA p. 78) the statement of\nthe law made by the trial court\nin that case\nthat for a merger to take place, ―the fusion of\ninterests required by law is to be in respect of the whole of the property‖.\n\nThis Court in\n\nBadri Narain Jha v. Rameshwar Dayal Singh\nheld that if a lessor purchases the whole of\nthe lessee's interest, the lease is extinguished by merger, but there can be no merger or\nextinction where one of several joint holders of the mokarrari interest purchases portion\nof the lakhraj interest. It was held that when there was no coalescence of the interest of\nthe lessor and the lessee in the whole of the estate, there could be no determination of the\nlease by merger. We do not think that it is necessary to multiply authorities in the face of\nthe plain language of the provision and the authoritative pronouncements of the Privy\nCouncil and of this Court\nreferred to above\n. The position emerging from the relevant\nprovision of the\nTransfer of Property Act\nis that the lease or tenancy does not get\ndetermined by the tenant acquiring the rights of a co-owner landlord and a merger takes\nplace and the lease gets determined only if the entire reversion or the entire rights of the\nlandlord are purchased by the tenant.‖\n\n44. The above decisions show that a lessee who has taken assignment of the rights of\na co-owner lessor, cannot successfully raise the plea of determination of tenancy on the\nground of merger of his lessee's estate in that of a share of the undivided estate of the\nlandlord, unless that merger is in respect of the complete title or interest. Therefore, it is not\nopen to the defendant to challenge the maintainability of the suit, on the ground that either the\nrelief of possession, or of partition, is unavailable. Clearly, the recitals of the sale deed relied\nupon by the defendant, dated 21-10-2005, show that the entire interest in the suit property,\nwas not conveyed; what was conveyed by the heirs of S.N. Sheopuri was a fractional (50%)\nshare. When the suit was filed, both co-owners had joined as co-plaintiffs. The sale deed\nenjoined the vendors (heirs of S.N. Sheopuri) to withdraw the suit; they attempted to do so,\nbut the order made initially, was recalled, since the co-plaintiff who had always wished to\nprosecute the action, opposed withdrawal. Therefore, the heirs of Sheopuri withdrew from the\nsuit, in their capacity as heirs and legal representatives of the co-plaintiff, who never\nexpressed her consent to abandon the claim for possession. In these circumstances, the\nlessee‟s objection to the maintainability of the suit has to fail.\n\n45. The fifth issue was framed at the behest of the defendant, who contended that it was\nentitled to ` 2,00,000/- as counter claim, on account of excess payment of amounts allegedly\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 23\nmade to the plaintiff. The defendant has not led any evidence, on this aspect; the basis of the\nclaim, was that the enhancement of rents agreed to periodically by the parties, was contrary to\nthe mandate of the\nDelhi Rent Control Act\n. However, this court has held earlier, that the said\nAct is inapplicable. Furthermore, in the absence of any evidence, the claim is vague, and has\nto fail.\n\n46. In view of the above discussion, the findings in regard to Issue Nos. 1-5 are in favour of\nthe plaintiff, and against the defendant; the suit is maintainable; the counter claim has to fail.\n\nISSUE NO. 6\n\n47. The onus of proving this issue was upon the plaintiff; it was alleged in the suit that the\ntenancy was terminated by letter dated 10-5-1995. To prove this, the plaintiff relied upon the\nnotice of termination, marked as Ex. PW-1/3, dated 10-5-1995, and the receipt evidencing its\nbeing sent under registered cover (Ex. PW-1/4). The registered acknowledgement card, with\nthe signature of Ms. S. Madhok, the defendant‟s finance manager, was marked as Ex. PW-1/5.\n\n48. The defendant replied to the legal notice (Ex.PW-1/3) by which the plaintiff had sought\nto terminate the tenancy. In PW-1/3, the plaintiff had stated that the tenancy would stand\nterminated by the end of June, 1995. In PW-1/6, i.e., the defendant‟s letter in reply to the\nplaintiff‟s notice terminating the tenancy, there is a clear acknowledgement of the receipt of\nthe letter. The only objection taken to the termination was that ―our tenancy is protected\nunder provisions of\nDelhi Rent Control Act\nand there is no legal ground with your client to\nterminate our tenancy‖.\n\n49. Having regard to the nature of the documentary evidence, it is clear and points to the\nplaintiff putting an end to the tenancy w.e.f. 30.06. 1995, through PW-1/3, which was\nreceived and replied to by the defendant, this Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff has\nproved this issue. Accordingly, it is held that the plaintiff validly terminated the tenancy\nthrough notice dated 10.05.1995 Ex.PW-1/3.\n\nISSUE NOS.8 & 9\n\n50. The plaintiff, to prove the claim for mesne profits, relied upon the certified copy of a\nregistered lease deed dated 19.01.1998 in respect of the premises being basement and ground\nfloor of N-4, GK-I Market, New Delhi. By that document, the owner/lessor had agreed to let\nout the premises for a monthly rent of ` 3,75,000/- inclusive of house tax initially for a period\nof three years till 19.12.2000 with the option to renew it subsequently, to the Oriental Bank of\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 24\nCommerce. To establish that the lease had been validly executed, PW-2 - Pradeep Bhaskar,\nSenior Manager of Oriental Bank of Commerce, which had leased the property deposed and\nproved the copy of the lease deed as Ex.PW-2/1. He stated that the total area of the premises\n1440 Sq. Ft. During the cross examination of the witness, the defendant attempted to\ndiscredit him, suggesting that the lease deed had not been signed by him and, therefore, his\nidentification of the signatory i.e. another official, was unreliable. It was further urged on\nbehalf of the defendant that the plaintiff has not deposed herself and a power of attorney Shri\nVibhu Mushran had testified on her behalf. In the absence of positive testimony by the\nplaintiff about the alleged damages and mesne profits, it was urged that the Court ought not to\ntake cognizance of the documentary materials and pass any orders in support of the plaintiff‟s\nclaim.\n\n51. The plaintiff has alleged that the total area occupied by the tenant/ defendant was 4200\nsquare feet. The defendant has produced a site plan Ex.DW-1/1. This has given the\nmeasurement of the suit premises in the basement, ground, first floor and the terrace of the\nproperty. Furthermore, PW-1, during the cross-examination, stated that the entire premises\nwere in the possession of defendant under a single tenancy in 1974. The defendant has not\ndenied that the area is 4200 square feet.\n\n52. This court notices that the plaintiff has not led any further evidence to show the locational\nadvantage of the suit premises vis-à-vis N-4, GK-1 Market. In these circumstances, even\nthough the suit premises ex facie comprises an area larger than that of N-4, the Court cannot\nassume that the rate of rent at least in the year 1995 would have been of the same. Having\nregard to these circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that w.e.f. July, 1995, the monthly\nrent for the premises was about ` 3.75 Lakhs.\n\n53. Learned counsel for the defendant had urged that the plaintiff‟s claim for mesne profits\ncannot be granted because w.e.f. 21.10.2005, it (the defendant) became a co-owner and the\nrights of the erstwhile co-owner/co-plaintiff Sheopuri merged. The plaintiff being an\nundivided co-owner could not claim mesne profits from the defendant who was in possession.\nThis argument may at once seem attractive. However, the ruling of the Supreme Court in\nIndian Umbrella Mfg. Col. and Pramod Kumar Jaiswal considered together with\nSection-109\n\nand\n111 (d)\nof the Transfer of Property Act clarify that even a claim for possession against the\ntenant who subsequently - during the pendency of the eviction proceedings - purchases an\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 25\nundivided share in the rented property, would not render the relief of possession infructuous.\nSuch being the case, the defendant‟s rights merged with that of the deceased co-owner\nSheopuri on 21.10.2005. Till the date of his death, the said co-owner did not express any\ndesire to withdraw the claim for possession or mesne profits. No doubt, the sale deed\ncontains a commitment by the heir of S.N. Sheopuri to withdraw their claim in the suit (which\nincludes the claim for mesne profits). However, in the opinion of the Court, that would not in\nany way prejudice or impinge upon the co-plaintiff‟s claim for 50% of the mesne profits from\nthe date of the termination of the tenancy till the merger of the interest i.e. on 21.10.2005. It\nis accordingly held that the second plaintiff who continued with the suit is entitled to mesne\nprofits and damages from 1.7.1995 to 21.10.2005.\n\n54. Having regard to the discussion in the preceding paragraph where the Court had\ndetermined the mesne profits in respect of the suit property at ` 3.75 Lakhs, the Court is of\nthe opinion that the second plaintiff who has persisted with the suit and the claims outlined in\nit, is entitled to a decree for mesne profits at the rate of ` 1,87,500/- (being 50% of the\namount determined by the Court, i.e., ` 3.75 Lakhs per month as mesne profits) from\n1.7.1995 to 21.10.2005. The said amount works out to ` ` 2,30,61,000/- (Rupees two crores,\nthirty lakhs and sixty one thousand only). The plaintiff is entitled to a decree for the said\namount.\n\n55. The last issue is the one pertaining to relief. Although, the learned Additional District\nJudge had, during the course of the proceedings, deleted the claim for possession while\namending the issues, the order recording the same also noticed that the surviving plaintiff no.2\nhad not amended the plaint seeking the relief of partition. Subsequently, the plaintiff did so\nand the amendment was allowed. It was argued during the submissions - on behalf of the\nplaintiff - that every claim for partition also carries within it, a claim for the relief of division\nof the property jointly held by the co-owners. The learned counsel had relied upon the ruling\nreported as\nShub Karan Bubna v. Sita Saran Bubna\n, (2009) 9 SCC 689 and stated that the\nCourt would be within its rights to pass an appropriate decree for partition with the\nconsequential directions to separate the shares and hand over vacant possession of the same to\nthe respective co-owners.\n\nIn\nShub Karan Bubna\n's case, the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n\"6. A partition of a property can be only among those having a share or interest\nin it. A person who does not have a share in such property cannot obviously be a\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 26\nparty to a partition. ―Separation of share‖ is a species of ―partition‖. When all co-\nowners get separated, it is a partition. Separation of share(s) refers to a division\nwhere only one or only a few among several co-owners/coparceners get separated,\nand others continue to be joint or continue to hold the remaining property jointly\nwithout division by metes and bounds. For example, where four brothers owning a\nproperty divide it among themselves by metes and bounds, it is a partition. But if only\none brother wants to get his share separated and other three brothers continue to\nremain joint, there is only a separation of the share of one brother.\n\n7. In a suit for partition or separation of a share, the prayer is not only for\ndeclaration of the plaintiff's share in the suit properties, but also division of his share\nby metes and bounds. This involves three issues:\n\n(i) whether the person seeking division has a share or interest in the suit\nproperty/properties;\n\n(ii) whether he is entitled to the relief of division and separate possession; and\n\n(iii) how and in what manner, the property/properties should be divided by metes\nand bounds?\n\nIn a suit for partition or separation of a share, the court at the first stage decides\nwhether the plaintiff has a share in the suit property and whether he is entitled to\ndivision and separate possession. The decision on these two issues is exercise of a\njudicial function and results in first stage decision termed as ―decree‖ under Order\n20 Rule 18(1) and termed as ―preliminary decree‖ under Order 20 Rule 18(2) of the\nCode. The consequential division by metes and bounds, considered to be a ministerial\nor administrative act requiring the physical inspection, measurements, calculations\nand considering various permutations/combinations/alternatives of division is\nreferred to the Collector under Rule 18(1) and is the subject-matter of the final\ndecree under Rule 18(2).\n\n................. ........................\n\n18.2. In regard to immovable properties (other than agricultural lands paying land\nrevenue), that is, buildings, plots, etc. or movable properties:\n\n(i) where the court can conveniently and without further enquiry make the\ndivision without the assistance of any Commissioner, or where parties agree upon the\nmanner of division, the court will pass a single decree comprising the preliminary\ndecree declaring the rights of several parties and also a final decree dividing the suit\nproperties by metes and bounds.\n\n(ii) where the division by metes and bounds cannot be made without further\ninquiry, the court will pass a preliminary decree declaring the rights of the parties\ninterested in the property and give further directions as may be required to effect the\ndivision. In such cases, normally a Commissioner is appointed (usually an engineer,\ndraughtsman, architect, or lawyer) to physically examine the property to be divided\nand suggest the manner of division. The court then hears the parties on the report,\nand passes a final decree for division by metes and bounds.\n\nThe function of making a partition or separation according to the rights declared by the\npreliminary decree (in regard to non-agricultural immovable properties and movables) is\nentrusted to a Commissioner, as it involves inspection of the property and examination of\nvarious alternatives with reference to practical utility and site conditions. When the\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 27\nCommissioner gives his report as to the manner of division, the proposals contained in\nthe report are considered by the court; and after hearing objections to the report, if any,\nthe court passes a final decree whereby the relief sought in the suit is granted by\nseparating the property by metes and bounds. It is also possible that if the property is\nincapable of proper division, the court may direct sale thereof and distribution of the\nproceeds as per the shares declared.\n\n18.3. As the declaration of rights or shares is only the first stage in a suit for\npartition, a preliminary decree does not have the effect of disposing of the suit. The suit\ncontinues to be pending until partition, that is, division by metes and bounds takes place\nby passing a final decree. An application requesting the court to take necessary steps to\ndraw up a final decree effecting a division in terms of the preliminary decree, is neither\nan application for execution (falling under\nArticle 136\nof the\nLimitation Act\n) nor an\napplication seeking a fresh relief (falling under\nArticle 137\nof the\nLimitation Act\n). It is\nonly a reminder to the court to do its duty to appoint a Commissioner, get a report, and\ndraw a final decree in the pending suit so that the suit is taken to its logical conclusion.‖\n\nIt is thus clear that in a suit where one of the reliefs claimed is partition, the court has the\npower to direct division, by metes and bounds. So far as the objection of the defendants that\nthere is no issue for partition, and that the issue relating to possession was deleted (i.e.\noriginal Issue No. 7) is concerned, the court is of the opinion that issues are framed, keeping\nin mind what the parties have to prove, having regard to their respective pleadings. The relief\nof possession was never given up, even though the court deleted it from the issues originally\nframed. The relief of partition was added, through amendment, after the defendant‟s\nobjections were considered. In these circumstances, the parties have led their evidence, and\nrelied on all documentary materials, being fully aware of the real controversy between them.\nIt is too late in the day for the defendants to say that since the issue of possession was\ndeleted, and no issue pertaining to partition was framed, the court is precluded from\nconsidering them. Trial in a civil court is not a proceeding, where procedural technicalities\nwould outweigh claims based on substantive legal rights, and justice. As long as the parties\nare aware of the facts they have to prove and rebut, and so long as their pleadings contain the\nbasis of their allegations, and claims, the court would not be precluded from moulding the\nrelief, having regard to the conspectus of circumstances, and to meet the ends of justice.\nProvisions like Order 7, Rule 7, and Order 14, Rule 5,\nCPC\nclothe the court with ample\npower in this regard. The plaintiff, in this case, has confined the relief to a decree for\npartition, in respect of her 50% undivided share in the suit property. She is entitled to it.\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 28\n\n56. In view of the discussion in the preceding paragraphs, it is held that the plaintiff is\nentitled to a preliminary decree for partition, of her half undivided share in the suit property.\nShri. Ravi Avasthi, Advocate (Mobile No. 9891207152) is hereby appointed as Local\nCommissioner to visit the suit property, and after inspecting the same, and considering the\nviews of the plaintiff and defendants, furnish a report to the court as to the most convenient\nmanner in which to physically partition it (i.e. No.14, N- Block Market Greater Kailash-I,\nNew Delhi). The commissioner shall prepare the report and file the same in court, within\neight weeks. The commissioner shall be paid ` 75,000/- as fee, to be shared equally by the\nparties. The plaintiff is also entitled to a decree for mesne profits, in the sum of\n`2,30,61,000/- (Rupees two crores, thirty lakhs and sixty one thousand only) subject to\npaying the requisite deficit court fee for the same. The suit shall be listed on 13th September,\n2011 before the regular Bench as per roster allocation for consideration of the\ncommissioner‟s report, and further proceedings thereon.\n\n57. A preliminary decree, in the above terms and decree for ` 2,30,61,000/- (Rupees two\ncrores, thirty lakhs and sixty one thousand only)- subject to payment of the prescribed court\nfee, shall be drawn. The plaintiff is entitled to costs. The defendant‟s counter claim is\ndismissed.\n\nJULY 04, 2011 (S.RAVINDRA BHAT)\nJUDGE\n\nCS(OS) No.246/2009 Page 29",

THE PLAINTIFFS, CLAIMED TO BE OWNERS OF PREMISES BEARING NO.14, N- BLOCK MARKET, GREATER KAILASH-I, NEW DELHI- 110 048 (\"THE SUIT PREMISES\"), LOCATED ON A 197 SQ. YARDS PLOT CONSISTING OF A BASEMENT, GROUND FLOOR, FIRST FLOOR AND SECOND FLOOR, WITH A TOTAL COVERED AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 4,200 SQ. FEET. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS INDUCTED AS A TENANT IN THE SUIT PREMISES SOMETIME IN THE 1970‟S. FROM TIME TO TIME THE RENT WAS INCREASED, THE LAST RENT BEING ` 20,000/- PER MONTH. NO LEASE DEED WAS EXECUTED FOR LETTING OUT THE SUIT PREMISES; THE ARRANGEMENT WAS A MONTHLY TENANCY, STARTING FROM THE FIRST DAY OF EACH ENGLISH CALENDAR MONTH AND EXPIRING ON THE LAST DAY.  CS(OS) NO.246/2009 PAGE 1 2. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT BY A REGISTERED POST NOTICE DATED 10TH MAY, 1995 SENT ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS, THE TENANCY WAS TERMINATED WITH EFFECT FROM THE EXPIRY OF MID NIGHT OF 30 TH JUNE, 1995. THE NOTICE STATED THAT IF THE DEFENDANT CONSIDERED THE TENANCY MONTH TO BE DIFFERENT (FROM THE ONE STATED IN IT), THEN THE TENANCY WOULD STAND TERMINATED IN JUNE, 1995, ON THE EXPIRY OF THE DAY, WHICH ACCORDING TO IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF THE TENANCY MONTH. BY A LETTER DATED 31.05.1995 THE DEFENDANT RESPONDED TO THE NOTICE CONTENDING THAT ITS TENANCY WAS PROTECTED UNDER THE DELHI RENT CONTROL ACT . THE PLAINTIFF‟S OWNERSHIP OF THE PREMISES, EXTENT OF TENANCY PREMISES, THE MONTHLY RENT AND THE MONTH TO MONTH NATURE OF THE TENANCY WAS NOT DENIED. 3. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT DESPITE THE NOTICE, THE DEFENDANT DID NOT HAND OVER VACANT AND PHYSICAL POSSESSION; THE RENT OF THE SUIT PREMISES IS MORE THAT ` 3,500/- PER MONTH. THEREFORE, THE DELHI RENT CONTROL ACT DID NOT APPLY TO THE PREMISES. IT WAS ALLEGED THAT ON TERMINATION OF THE TENANCY THE DEFENDANT HAD NO RIGHT, TITLE OR INTEREST IN THE SUIT PREMISES AND AS SUCH THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO RECOVER THE POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES, AS ALSO MESNE PROFITS ON ACCOUNT OF ALLEGED WRONGFUL, UNAUTHORIZED AND ILLEGAL USE AND OCCUPATION OF THE SUIT PREMISES. IT IS ALLEGED THAT THE RENT OF THE PREMISES WAS PAID BY THE DEFENDANT AT THE RATE OF ` 20,000/- PER MONTH TILL 30TH APRIL, 1995. THE DEFENDANT USED TO REMIT RENT BY WAY OF A CHEQUE FOR ` 16,000/- AFTER DEDUCTING `4,000/- AS TDS. HOWEVER, FOR THE MONTH OF MAY, 1995 THE DEFENDANT SENT A CHEQUE FOR ` 19,200/- ALONG WITH A NOTE TO THE EFFECT THAT IT REPRESENTED A 10% INCREASE. THE PLAINTIFFS HAD NOT ASKED FOR OR ASSENTED TO AN INCREASE OF RENT NOR WAS THERE ANY AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR INCREASE OF RENT. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT SENDING OF A CHEQUE FOR A HIGHER AMOUNT WAS AN ATTEMPT BY THE DEFENDANT TO DEFEAT THE NOTICE OF TERMINATION. SINCE THE SAID CHEQUE WAS NOT FOR THE CORRECT AMOUNT IT WAS NOT EN-CASHED BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE RENT FOR THE MONTHS OF MAY AND JUNE, 1995 IS IN ARREARS. ACCORDINGLY, THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO A DECREE FOR ` 40,000/- BY WAY OF ARREARS OF RENT. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS MESNE PROFITS FOR THE PERIOD 01.07.1995 TO 31.08.1995 AT ` 1,00,000/- PER MONTH WHICH IS THE PREVAILING RATE IN THE AREA AT PRESENT AND FUTURE MESNE PROFITS AT THE RATE PREVAILING IN THE AREA AT THE TIME OF DISPOSAL OF THE SUIT. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE FURTHER ENTITLED TO INTEREST ON THE ARREARS OF RENT AND MESNE PROFITS @18% PER ANNUM AT MONTHLY RATES. 4. IT IS ALLEGED THAT EARLIER THE DEFENDANT WAS KNOWN AS FAB INDIA OVERSEAS PVT. LTD. HOWEVER, THE DEFENDANT‟S RECENT CORRESPONDENCE BEARS THE STAMP OF \"FAB INDIA OVERSEAS  CS(OS) NO.246/2009 PAGE 2 LTD.\" EVEN THOUGH ITS LETTERHEADS CONTINUE TO BEAR THE NAME \"FAB INDIA OVERSEAS PVT. LTD.\" THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THAT THE DEFENDANT HAS BECOME A DEEMED PUBLIC LIMITED COMPANY. 5. DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE SUIT, THE ORIGINAL PLAINTIFF SHRI S.N. SHEOPURI DIED ON 06.01.1999. HIS SHARE IN THE SUIT PROPERTY DEVOLVED UPON HIS ELDER DAUGHTER MRS. LAKSHMI DAR WHO WAS BROUGHT ON RECORD IN THE PROCEEDINGS. MRS. LAKSHMI DAR DIED ON 04.09.2002; CONSEQUENTLY, HER SON AND DAUGHTER MR. DHRUV DAR AND MRS. PREETI ATAL WERE BROUGHT ON RECORD IN PLACE OF THEIR DECEASED MOTHER. BY SALE DEED DATED 21.10.2005 MR. DHRUV DAR AND MRS. PREETI ATAL SOLD 50% SHARE IN THE SUIT PROPERTY TO THE DEFENDANT. CONSEQUENTLY THE SECOND PLAINTIFF AND THE DEFENDANT BECAME CO-OWNERS OF THE SUIT PROPERTY IN EQUAL SHARES.
