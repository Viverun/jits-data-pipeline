Whether the judgment should be reported in NO\n the Digest?\n\nANIL KUMAR, J.\n\n*\n\n1. This order shall dispose of bail application of the petitioner in FIR\n\nNo.259/2003 Police Station Rajinder Nagar under \nSection\n\n302\n/\n364A\n/\n120B\n/\n201\n of IPC. The petitioner has contended that she is\n\na woman who is in judicial custody for almost 4½ years and she has\n\nbeen implicated falsely. She hails from a good family.\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 1 of 20\n\n 2. It is asserted that she has clean antecedents and is not involved\n\nin any other criminal case and her family comprises of her minor\n\ndaughter who is suffering immensely on account of her separation from\n\nthe petitioner. The husband of the petitioner is also a co-accused who is\n\nalthough on bail is having strained relationship with the petitioner and\n\nthe well being of minor is not taken care of by him and the husband is\n\nliving separately.\n\n3. It is also contended that she had been granted interim bail for a\n\nperiod of 2 months and she has not exploited the liberty granted to him.\n\nThe assertion is also made by the petitioner that her daughter is\n\nsuffering from separation and the presence of the petitioner is\n\nnecessary for her normal development as a human being.\n\n4. The petitioner had filed another bail application being Bail Appl.\n\nNo.688/2005 which was withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh\n\napplication at a later stage as the prosecution had cited 87 witnesses\n\nand none of the witnesses had been examined till that time.\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 2 of 20\n\n 5. It is pleaded on behalf of petitioner that a chargesheet was filed\n\non 6th December, 2003 and charges were framed by order dated 2nd\n\nMarch, 2005 and case is progressing at a snail pace despite the\n\ndirections passed by this Court on 12th June, 2006.\n\n6. On 12th July, 2006 in the Bail Appl.No.541/2006 while disposing\n\nit, it was held that the petitioner and her counsel shall cooperate with\n\nthe investigation and on her doing so the trial Court shall expedite the\n\nhearing and shall endeavor to complete the evidence within nine\n\nmonths. The petitioner was also given liberty to move the bail\n\napplication again and with those observations the bail application was\n\ndismissed where after the present bail application has been filed.\n\n7. It is asserted on behalf of petitioner that despite the order dated\n\n12th July, 2006 only 24 witnesses out of 87 total witnesses has been\n\nexamined till the date of filing of the application on 7th April, 2008 and\n\nit will take a long time to complete the evidence.\n\n8. The other contention of the petitioner is that the entire case of the\n\nprosecution is based on disclosure statement of co-accused and the\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 3 of 20\n\n disclosure statement of petitioner is inadmissible in evidence being hit\n\nby \nSection 27\n.\n\n9. The learned counsel for the petitioner has mainly emphasized\n\nthat on account of non completion of recording of evidence despite the\n\norder dated 12th July, 2006, the petitioner has been denied the\n\nexpeditious trial and the delay in trial has resulted in breach of \nArticle\n\n21\n of the Constitution of India and in the circumstances she is entitled\n\nfor bail. The reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner on 1990(1) Crimes 232, Ashok Soloman v. State; AIR 1979 SC\n\n1360, Hussain Khatoon & Ors v.Home Secretary, State of Bihar; AIR\n\n1979 SC 1518, Nimeon Sanoma v.Home Secretary, Govt. of Meghalaya\n\n& Ors; AIR 1981 SC 939, Kadra Pehadiya & Ors v.State of Bihar; II\n\n(1992) CCR 1750, Shanta Kumar v.State; (2000) 9 SCC 398, Satya Brat\n\nGain v.State of Bihar; 1993(1) CC Cases 254, Nafe Singh v.State; II\n\n(1993) CCR 929, Salakhan Singh & Anr v.State of M.P and II (1992)\n\nCCR 2770, Shaikh Ashraf Abdul Kadar v. Asstt.Collector of Custom &\n\nAnr.\n\n10. The learned counsel has also relied on 1986 Cr.L.J 365,\n\nShakuntala Devi v.State of U.P; 1998 II AD (HC) (Bom) 1, Ram Das\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 4 of 20\n\n Dnyandeo Chandanahive v. State of Maharashtra; 78 (\n1999) DLT 388,\n\nSushila Dahas v. State\n and \nI (1998) CCR 169, Simantini Samntaray v.\n\nState of Orissa\n to contend that a woman is entitled for bail under\n\nproviso to \nSection 437\n of Criminal Procedure Code which is a beneficial\n\nprovision for woman.\n\n11. The application for bail to the petitioner is opposed on the ground\n\nthat after 12th July, 2006 the case was fixed for evidence on 31\n\noccasions out of which adjournment was sought by the petitioner and\n\non her behalf on 10 dates and on 2 dates presiding officer was on leave\n\nand on one date the Public Prosecutor was on leave. It is contended that\n\nconsidering the evidence already recorded there is sufficient evidence\n\nagainst the petitioner.\n\n12. In Ashok Soloman (Supra) relied on by the petitioner where the\n\nprosecution was for the offence under \nSection 20\n, \n21\n & \n29\n of Narcotics\n\nDrugs & Psychotropic Substances Act, the accused was released on bail\n\nas it was held that there was no further justification in incarcerating\n\nthe accused by denying him bail as he had already been in custody for\n\nmore than 2 years and the trial of the accused had made no headway\n\nand there was no material to show as to how much time the conclusion\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 5 of 20\n\n of the trial was likely to take. In the case of Shanta Kumar (Supra) the\n\naccused was facing trial for an offence under \nSection 302\n of IPC and not\n\na single witness had been examined for two years after framing of\n\ncharges and on that ground the bail was granted to the accused\n\nconsidering that the State had been oblivious to its obligation. In Satya\n\nBrat Gain (Supra) the accused was an undertrial prisoner for five years\n\nand there had not been any substantial progress nor there was any\n\nlikelihood of the progress in future and considering the dilatory\n\nprogress of the proceedings against the accused, incarceration of the\n\naccused for further period was not permitted and the accused was\n\nreleased on bail. In the case of Nafe Singh (Supra) relied on by the\n\npetitioner, the offences alleged were under Section 302, 201 & 506 in\n\nwhich prosecution had listed 15 to 20 witnesses and though the\n\nincident took place in May, 1989 only four witnesses were examined\n\nand it was not known as to how much time was be taken to examine\n\nthe rest of the witnesses. The accused had been in jail for more than\n\nthree years. In the circumstances it was held that the trial should have\n\nbeen over within a reasonable period of time and if the trial was\n\nprotracted the liberty of the undertrial could not be curtailed for an\n\nunreasonable period of time and, therefore, bail was granted. In\n\nSalakhan Singh (Supra) a Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High\n\nCourt had granted bail, as despite the Court‟s direction to conclude the\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 6 of 20\n\n trial within four months from the date of receipt of the copy of the order,\n\nthe trial Judge had not even commenced the trial and it was thought\n\nappropriate to grant the bail and the accused was released on bail. In a\n\ncase under the \nNDPS Act\n despite \nSection 37\n, the accused was granted\n\nbail as the prosecuting agency had been adopting delaying tactics and\n\nhad not produced the witnesses and had prolonged the trial in the case\n\nof Sheikh Ashraf Adbul Kadar (Supra).\n\n13. Considering the proviso to Section 437(1) it was held that the\n\nword \"may\" in first proviso should be read as \"shall\" and \"must\" and\n\nconsequently the accused woman who was 72 years of age and as the\n\nmatter was to be tried and evidence to be collected, on compassionate\n\ngrounds accused was granted bail in the case of Smt.Shakuntala Devi\n\n(Supra) by a Single Judge of Allahabad High Court. In Ramdas\n\nDnyandeo (Supra) despite a prima facie case regarding involvement of\n\nthe accused who was a woman, however, having regard to proviso to\n\nSection 437\n of the Criminal Procedure Code the accused woman was\n\ngranted bail.\n\n14. The proviso to \nSection 437(1)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code has\n\nbeen extrapolated even to \nSection 438\n of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 7 of 20\n\n in case of anticipatory bail. \nIn \nSushila Dahas\n (Supra) the accused was a\n\nwidow and despite implication of the accused in a statement under\n\nSection 161\n of the Criminal Procedure Code, she was granted\n\nanticipatory bail.\n \nSimilarly, a Single Judge of Orissa High Court in case\n\nof \nSimantini Samantaray\n (Supra), granted anticipatory bail in case of\n\nnon bailable offenses under \nSection 498A\n, \n304B\n and \n34\n of Indian Penal\n\nCode. The accused in the said case was a young girl of 20 years and it\n\nwas held that she is to be treated with compassion and mercy keeping\n\nin view spirit of proviso to \nSection 437(1)\n Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nand anticipatory bail was granted to her.\n\n15. The decision relied on behalf of the petitioner are apparently\n\ndistinguishable. A decision is only an authority for what it actually\n\ndecides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every\n\nobservation found therein nor what logically follows from the various\n\nobservations made in it. The ratio of any decision must be understood\n\nin the background of the facts of that case. It has been said long time\n\nago that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides, and not\n\nwhat logically follows from it. It is well settled that a little difference in\n\nfacts or additional facts may make a lot of difference in the precedential\n\nvalue of a decision. \nIn \nP.S.Rao Vs State, JT\n 2002 (3) SC 1, the Supreme\n\nCourt had held as under:\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 8 of 20\n\n \". There is always a peril in treating the words of judgment\n as though they are words in a legislative enactment and it\n is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in\n setting of the facts of a particular case. Circumstantial\n flexibility, one additional or different fact may make a world\n of difference between conclusion in two cases.\n\n In Ragiq Vs State, 1980 SCC (Crl) 946 it was observed as under:\n\n \"The ratio of one case cannot be mechanically applied to\n another case without having regard to the fact situation\n and circumstances obtaining in two cases.\"\n\n16. The learned prosecutor has relied on 144(2007) DLT 41, Amit\n\nRathi v. State; (\n2004) 7 SCC 528, Kalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh\n\nRanjan\n; (2007) Crl.Law Journal 304, Rajesh Ranjan @ Pappu Yadav v.\n\nCBI; 1993 Crl.L.J 2621 (All) Mohammad Main v. State of U.P; 1992\n\nCrl.L.J.3634, Chandraweati v. State of U.P; (\n2001) 4 SCC 280, Prahlad\n\nSingh Bhatia v. NCT Delhi\n to contend that the petitioner accused\n\nhaving undergone certain period of incarceration by itself would not\n\nentitle her to be enlarged on bail and that the trial is not likely to be\n\nconcluded in the near future itself or coupled with the period of\n\nincarceration would not be sufficient for enlarging the petitioner on bail\n\nwhen the gravity of offence alleged is severe.\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 9 of 20\n\n 17. The learned counsel for the State has also contended that merely\n\nbecause the petitioner was enlarged on interim bail twice, it will not\n\nipso facto entitle her for regular bail. Regarding the last seen evidence it\n\nis contended that the employees had seen her. The three employees\n\nwere asked to go away on the date of incident before the normal hours\n\ndespite their services being not terminated. It is contended that the\n\nevidence of the service provider also establishes that the deceased was\n\nwith the petitioner. The learned counsel has also contended that the\n\nmovement of the deceased and the petitioner coincided with the record\n\nof the cell phones.\n\n18. The learned counsel for the respondent has also emphasized on\n\nthe nature and gravity of offence. It is contended that the dead body of\n\nthe deceased was burnt and the car was abandoned at Faridabad. After\n\nstrangulation, the deceased body was taken in the car of the deceased\n\nand petrol and diesel was procured for burning the body. It is also\n\ncontended that from the evidence already led it is apparent that the\n\nfinger prints of the co-accused matched with the prints which were\n\nlifted. Pursuant to the disclosure by the accused, the place was pointed\n\nout where the dead body was burnt and bushes around the place were\n\nalso found to be burnt and some of the articles of the deceased were\n\nalso found at that place. Regarding petitioner it is contended that she\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 10 of 20\n\n also pointed out watch and shoes of the deceased and the credit cards\n\nof the deceased were recovered from the petitioner. The learned counsel\n\nfor the respondent also pointed out that the petitioner had even stolen\n\nthe credit cards of her father which were later on paid by her father.\n\nRegarding the delay in trial it is contended that the charges were\n\nframed on 2nd March, 2005 and before framing of charges four\n\nadjournments were sought. It is further contended that the trial was\n\ndirected to be completed within nine months subject to the petitioner\n\nand her counsel cooperating with the counsels. According to him on 10\n\ndates the matter was adjourned at the instance of the accused.\n\nRegarding reliance of petitioner‟s counsel under \nArticle 21\n of the\n\nConstitution it is contended that the speedy trial as claimed by the\n\npetitioner does not mean that the trial has to be concluded within a\n\nparticular period. According to the learned counsel merely because the\n\ntrial has not been concluded within the time granted by this Court\n\nsubject to the cooperation by the petitioner and her counsel, does not\n\ncreate a right in favor of petitioner. It is contended that while\n\nconsidering whether the petitioner should be enlarged on bail or not the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case also has to be considered.\n\n19. According to the learned Additional Public Prosecutor even the\n\nmobile of the deceased was used for a ransom call which was given at\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 11 of 20\n\n the residence of the deceased and the locality from where the call was\n\nmade was Noida. Sh.Amit Saxena who made the call is a co-accused\n\nand mobile of the deceased was recovered from him.\n\n20. The learned counsel for the respondent has also pointed out that\n\nthe four bail applications have already been dismissed and 10 witnesses\n\nhave turned hostile. Regarding the witnesses turning hostile, it is\n\ncontended that though the petitioner was in custody, however, one\n\nwitness Raj Kapoor supported the prosecution case initially. Later on\n\nwhen he appeared for cross-examination he turned hostile. It has also\n\nbeen pointed out that a witness Babu Khan appeared for his\n\nexamination-in-chief, however, the same could not be recorded and\n\nsubsequently when he appeared he had turned hostile. The plea\n\nregarding the condition of the minor daughter of the petitioner was\n\ntaken into consideration and the interim bail which was granted to her\n\nhad not been extended on the ground of mental condition of the\n\npetitioner‟s daughter. Regarding non cooperation by the petitioner and\n\nher counsel, it is contended that PW.10 Sh.Raj Kapoor was examined\n\non 11th October, 2006 and he was not cross examined on the ground of\n\nnon-availability of the senior counsel and on 26th February, 2007 he\n\nhad turned hostile.\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 12 of 20\n\n 21. In Amit Rathi (Supra) relied on by the respondent, the bail was\n\nsought on the ground that the accused had been in custody ever since\n\nthe date of his arrest and out of 172 prosecution witnesses only 86\n\nwitnesses had been examined and it would be unlikely that the trial\n\nwould be concluded in near future and the sole witness regarding\n\nsupply of revolver and cartridges had been examined. However, the\n\nCourt held that his testimony is to be evaluated in conjunction with any\n\nother evidence and release of the accused on bail in the midst of trial\n\nwhen more than half of prosecution witnesses were yet to be examined,\n\nwas held to be detrimental to a fair trial and the bail application was\n\nrejected. \nThe Apex Court had set aside the bail granted by a High Court\n\non the ground of period of incarceration already undergone and\n\nunlikelihood of trial concluding in the near future in \nKalyan Chandra\n\nSarkar\n (Supra). It was held that the mere fact that the accused has\n\nundergone certain period of incarceration by itself would not entitle the\n\naccused to be enlarged on bail nor the fact that the trial is not likely to\n\nbe concluded in near future either by itself or coupled with the period of\n\nincarceration would be sufficient for enlarging the accused on bail when\n\nthe gravity of the offence alleged is severe.\n In Rajesh Ranjan Yadav\n\n(Supra) the Apex Court had reiterated that grant of bail depends on\n\nfacts and circumstances of each case and no absolute rule can be\n\nculled that the bail must be granted on account of long period of\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 13 of 20\n\n imprisonment. Considering the ramification of \nArticle 21\n the Apex Court\n\nhad held that it is of great importance because it enshrines the\n\nfundamental right of individual liberty but at the same time a balance\n\nhas to be struck between the right to individual liberty and the interest\n\nof society. The Supreme Court had further held that no right can be\n\nabsolute and reasonable restriction can be placed on them. The\n\nSupreme Court had held as under:-\n\n \"10. In our opinion none of the aforesaid decisions can be\n said to have laid down any absolute and unconditional rule\n about when bail should be granted by the Court and when\n it should not. It all depends on the facts and circumstances\n of each case and it cannot be said there is any absolute\n rule that because a long period of imprisonment has\n expired bail must necessarily be granted.\n\n 11. ............. The condition laid down under Section\n 437(1)(i) is since qua non for granting bail even under\n Section 439 of the Code. In the impugned order it is noticed\n that the High Court has given the period of incarceration\n already undergone by the accused and the unlikelihood of\n trial concluding in the near future as grounds sufficient to\n enlarge the accused on bail, in spite of the fact that the\n accused stands charged of offences punishable with life\n imprisonment or even death penalty. In such cases, in our\n opinion, the mere fact that the accused has undergone\n certain period of incarceration (three years in this case) by\n itself would not entitled the accused to be enlarged on bail,\n nor the fact that the trial is not likely to be concluded, in\n the near future either by itself or coupled with the period of\n incarceration would be sufficient for enlarging the appellant\n on bail when the gravity of the offence alleged is severe and\n there are allegations of tampering with the witnesses by the\n accused during the period he was on bail.\"\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 14 of 20\n\n 22. A Single Judge of Allahabad High Court in Mohammad Mian\n\n(Supra) had also held that there is no statutory provision under which\n\nan accused can claim his release on bail for there being inordinate delay\n\nin his trial before the Sessions Judge and it would not be prudent to lay\n\ndown that in every case the accused should be enlarged on bail if there\n\nhas been a long and inordinate delay in his trial.\n\n23. The learned counsel for the respondent has also contended that\n\nthe alleged entitlement to bail being a woman under proviso to Section\n\n437(1) is not mandatory and has relied on Chandrawati (Supra). It was\n\nheld that overriding considerations in granting bail which are common\n\nboth in \nSection 437(1)\n and \n439(1)\n of Criminal Procedure Code are the\n\nnature and gravity of the circumstances in which the offence has been\n\ncommitted, position and status of the accused with reference to the\n\nvictim and the witnesses and likelihood of the accused fleeing from\n\njustice and tampering with witnesses etc. It was held that the bail is at\n\nthe most a matter of procedural privilege and not an accrued right until\n\nit is granted. Consequently, it was held that the accused would not be\n\nentitled to bail merely being a woman on account of proviso to \nSection\n\n437(4)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code. It was further held that the\n\ncause of public justice also has to be zealously guarded compared to\n\nthe rights of a criminal defendant. Interest of society and also cause of\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 15 of 20\n\n public justice has also to be kept in mind while granting or refusing\n\nbail. Consequently, if offence is of such a nature which affects the vital\n\ninterest of the society and has adverse effect on the social and family\n\nlife, in such matters the issue is to be considered with reference to them\n\nand one of the consideration which has to be weighed for granting or\n\nrefusing bail is a nature of the offence and its heinousness.\n\n24. Learned counsel for the parties argued at length regarding the\n\ncompliance or non compliance of order dated 12th July, 2006 in Bail\n\nApplication No.541 of 2006 whereby it was held that the petitioner and\n\nher counsel shall cooperate with the investigation and on her doing so\n\nthe Trial Court shall expedite the hearing and endeavor to complete the\n\nevidence within nine months. Learned counsel for the respondent had\n\ncontended that on 10 dates the matter was adjourned at the instance of\n\npetitioner/accused which is refuted by the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner. Detailed explanations have been given by both the parties\n\nregarding various adjournments. It may not be necessary to go into\n\neach and every date on which the adjournments were sought by the\n\npetitioner/accused. It cannot be denied that on some of the dates\n\nadjournment has been sought by the petitioner. If the adjournment\n\nhas been sought by the petitioner or her counsel, it may not be possible\n\nto infer that that the petitioner and her counsel had cooperated with the\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 16 of 20\n\n investigation. In any case by order dated 12th July, 2006, this Court\n\nhad directed to make an endeavor to complete the evidence within nine\n\nmonths. This Court had not passed an order that the evidence should\n\nbe concluded in all probabilities within nine months. \nLearned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner has also pointed out a subsequent order passed by the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge holding that considering various\n\nfactors, it was not possible to take the case on day-to-day basis.\n\nConsidering all the facts and circumstances, it cannot be inferred that\n\nsince the trial has not been concluded within nine months, a right has\n\naccrued or crystallized in favor of the petitioner to be released on bail.\n\nFrom the perusal of the trial court record, it cannot be inferred that the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge did not make endeavor to complete\n\nthe evidence in terms of order dated 12th July, 2006. The Apex Court in\n\nKalyan Chand Sarkar\n (supra) had held that merely because the accused\n\nhas undergone a certain period of incarceration by itself would not\n\nentitle the accused to be enlarge on bail nor the fact that the trial is not\n\nlikely to be concluded in near future either by itself or coupled with the\n\nperiod of incarceration would entitle the accused to be enlarged on bail\n\nwhen the gravity of offence alleged is severe. In the circumstances,\n\napparently it cannot be inferred that the endeavor was not made to\n\ncomply with the order dated 12th July, 2006. From the perusal of the\n\nrecord of the trial court, it is apparent that the progress has been made\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 17 of 20\n\n and the witnesses have been examined. It also cannot be inferred that\n\nthe petitioner and her counsel fully cooperated in terms of order dated\n\n12th July, 2006.\n\n25. The other contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is\n\nthat the petitioner being a woman is entitled for bail under proviso to\n\nSection 437\n of the Code of Civil Procedure which is a beneficial\n\nlegislation for women. The judgments relied on by the petitioner do not\n\nlay down any absolute and unconditional rule that bail should be\n\ngranted if the accused is a woman. Overriding consideration in\n\ngranting bail are nature and gravity of circumstances in which the\n\noffense is committed, possession and status of the accused with\n\nreference to the victim and the witnesses and likelihood of the accused\n\nfleeing from justice and tempering with the witnesses etc.\n\nConsequently, it will not be appropriate to contend that the petitioner is\n\nentitled for a bail merely because she is a woman under proviso to\n\nSection 437(4)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code. Though the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondent has highlighted the evidence which has\n\nalready been led and has contended that prima facie inference can be\n\ndrawn regarding complicity of the petitioner in the offense. However,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner had stated that those factors are not\n\nrelevant for the purpose of granting or refusing bail to the petitioner.\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 18 of 20\n\n As is already held by this Court that merely because the petitioner is a\n\nwoman does not entitle her for bail under proviso to Section 437 (4) but\n\nthe nature and gravity offense and heinousness of the offense also has\n\nto be considered. It is also contended that the circumstances in which\n\nthe offense was committed, position and status of the accused with\n\nreference to the factum and the witnesses and the accused tempering\n\nwith the witnesses etc. has also to be taken into consideration. In the\n\ncircumstances, it will not be correct to say that the contentions and\n\npleas of the respondent regarding the nature and the way the crime is\n\nalleged to have been committed are not relevant. Consequently, the\n\npetitioner is not entitled for bail merely because she is a woman under\n\nproviso to \nSection 437(4)\n of Criminal Procedure Code.\n\n26. Consequently, in the entirety of facts and circumstances and\n\nconsidering the nature, gravity and the heinous manner in which the\n\noffence has been alleged to be committed and other facts and\n\ncircumstances, this court is not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner\n\nat this stage. The trial is pending for a considerable period and\n\nconsequently the Sessions Court is directed to make every endeavor to\n\ncomplete the trial as expeditiously as possible and if possible to take up\n\nthe matter for hearing on day-to-day basis. The application of the\n\npetitioner for bail is, therefore, dismissed with directions as stipulated\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 19 of 20\n\n hereinabove to the trial Court. The trial Court record be also sent back\n\nforthwith.\n\nJanuary 13, 2009 ANIL KUMAR J.\n\n„Dev‟\n\n Bail Application 736/2008 Page 20 of 20",
