Further, a writ of\n\nmandamus has been sought to direct the respondents to decide afresh\n\nthe claim of the petitioner and to count the ad hoc service rendered by\n\nhim as Sub Divisional Engineer for the grant of time scale, seniority\n\nand other consequential benefits.\n\n2. The brief facts, as have been pleaded in the petition, are\n\nthat the petitioner joined the respondent-depart\n respondent department as Junior Engineer\n\nin the year 1970 and thereafter vide order dated 27.11.1998\n 27.11.1998, he was\n\npromoted as Sub Divisional Engineer on stop\n stop-gap arrangement for a\n\nperiod of six months, subject to the approval of the Haryana Public\n\nService Commission. The said ad hoc promotion was treated as regular\n\nw.e.f. 01.01.2005 and thereafter the petitio\n petitioner retired from service on\n\nattaining the age of superannuation on 30.11.2006 as SDE (Civil).\n\nAfter eight years of his retirement, petitioner submitted representations\n\ndated 13.11.2014,\n 13.11.201 18.01.2015 followed by legal notice dated\n\n23.02.2015 and representation\n representation dated 07.11.2016, claiming counting of\n\nhis ad hoc service from 01.12.1998 to 31.12.2004 for all benefits such\n\nas next scale after five years of service and other retirement benefits\n\nand seniority. The said claim was considered and rejected by the\n\nrespondents\n ndents, vide order dated 22.05.2015\n .05.2015 (Annexure P\n P-4), which has\n\nbeen impugned in the present petition.\n\n3.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the ad\n\nhoc service rendered by the petitioner is liable to be counted for the\n\npurpose of grant of time scale and seniority in view of the law laid\n\ndown by this Court in CWP No.8604 of 2007 - Dr. Surinder Kumar\n\nMishra and others v. State of Haryana and others - decided on\n\n09.09.2010,, which has been upheld in \nLPA No.886 of 2011 - State of\n\nHaryana and others v. Surinder\n Surinder Kumar Mishra and others\n - decided\n\non 13.10.2011.\n\n 13.10.2011\n\n5. Per contra, learned State counsel has argued that present\n\npetition is liable\n liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. He\n\nfurther submitted that even on merits also, the ad hoc service rendered\n\nby the petitioner cannot be counted for the purpose of grant of time\n\nscale and seniority.\n\n6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\n\nthe record.\n\n7. The issues which arise in the present petition are as to\n\nwhether the instant petition filed by the petitioner\n petitioner, after a considerable\n\ndelay, is liable to be dismissed on account of delay and laches and\n\nwhether the ad hoc service rendered by the petitioner from 01.12.1998\n\nto 31.12.2004 can be counted for the grant of time scale and seniority\n seniority.\n\n8. The facts are not in dispute that the petitioner joined the\n\nservice as Junior Engineer in the year 19700 and was promoted as Sub\n\nDivisional Engineer on stop-gap\n stop gap arrangement\n arrangement, vide order dated\n\n27.11.1998,, and the said ad hoc arrangement\n arrangement, was made regular w.e.f.\n\n01.01.2005\n 5 and the petitioner retired from service on attaining the age\n\n 3 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 4\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\nof superannuation on 30.11.2006 and submitted representation for the\n\nfirst time on 13.11.2014 i.e. after eight years of his retirement.\n\n9. Admittedly, there is gross, inordinate and unexplained\n\ndelay of twelve years in filing the present writ petition for redressal of\n\nhis grievance.\n\n grievance\n\n10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in \"\nYunus (Baboobhai) A\n\nHamid Padvekar vs State of Maharashtra Through\n its Secretary and\n\nothers\",, 2009(2) SCT 24,\n 24, while referring to the issue of delay and\n\nlatches, had held as follows:-\n\n follows:\n\n \"8.\n\n \n8. Delay or laches is one of the factors which is to\n be borne in mind by the High Courts when they exercise\n their discretionary powers under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the 'Constitution'). In\n an appropriate case the High Court may refuse to invoke\n its extraordinary powers if there is such negligence or\n omission on the part of the applicant to assert his right as\n taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and other\n circumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party.\n Even where\n re fundamental right is involved the matter is still\n within the discretion of the Court as pointed out in \nDurga\n Prasad v. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports\n (AIR\n 1970 SC 769).. Of course, the discretion has to be\n exercised judicially and reasonably.\n\n 9.. What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes\n Peacock in Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Prosper\n Armstrong Hurde etc. \n(1874) 5 PC 221 at page 239 was\n approved by this Court in \nMoon Mills Ltd. v. Industrial\n Courts\n (AIR 1967 SC 1450) and Maharashtra State\n Transport\n sport Corporation v. Balwant Regular Motor Service\n (AIR 1969 SC 329),, Sir Barnes had stated:\n\n 4 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 5\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n \"Now the doctrine of laches in Courts of\n Equity is not an arbitrary or technical doctrine.\n Where it would be practically unjust to give a\n remedy either because the party has, by his conduct\n done that which might fairly be regarded as\n equivalent to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct\n and neglect he has though perhaps not waiving that\n remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in\n which it would not be reaso\n reasonable to place him if the\n remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of\n these cases, lapse of time and delay are most\n material. But in every case, if an argument against\n relief, which otherwise would be just, if founded\n upon mere delay, that delay of course not amounting\n to a bar by any statute of limitation, the validity of\n that defence must be tried upon principles\n substantially equitable. Two circumstances always\n important in such cases are, the length of the delay\n and the nature of the acts done dduring the interval\n which might affect either party and cause a balance\n of justice or injustice in taking the one course or the\n other, so far as relates to the remedy.\"\n\n 10. It would be appropriate to note certain decisions\n of this Court in which this aspec\n aspect has been dealt with in\n relation with \nArticle 32\n of the Constitution. It is apparent\n that what has been stated as regards that Article would\n apply, a fortiori, to \nArticle 226.\n It was observed in R.N\n Bose v. Union of India (AIR 1970 SC 470) that no relief\n can be given to the petitioner who without any reasonable\n explanation approaches this Court under \nArticle 32\n after\n inordinate delay. It was stated that though \nArticle 32\n is\n itself a guaranteed right, it does not follow from this that it\n was the intention off the Constitution makers that this\n Court should disregard all principles and grant relief in\n petitions filed after inordinate delay.\n\n \n11. It was stated in \nState of M.P. v. Nandlal\n (AIR\n 1987 SC 251) that the High Court in exercise of its\n discretion does nott ordinarily assist the tardy and the\n\n 5 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 6\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n indolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. If there is\n inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner and such\n delay is not satisfactorily explained, the High Court may\n decline to intervene and grant relief in exer\n exercise of its writ\n jurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is premised on a\n number of factors. The High Court does not ordinarily\n permit a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy\n because it is likely to cause confusion and public\n inconvenience and bringg in its trail new injustices, and if\n writ jurisdiction is exercised after unreasonable delay, it\n may have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and\n inconvenience but also injustice on third parties. It was\n pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is iinvoked,\n unexplained delay coupled with the creation of third party\n rights in the meantime is an important factor which also\n weighs with the High Court in deciding whether or not to\n exercise such jurisdiction.\n\n 12. In view of the aforesaid position we are nnot\n inclined to interfere in this appeal which is dismissed\n accordingly.\"\n\n11. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nState of\n\nUttaranchal and another v. Sri Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari and\n\nothers\n, 2013(6) SLR 629,\n 629, while considering the issue regarding delay\n\nand\n nd laches and referring to earlier judgments on the issue, opined that\n\nrepeated representations made will not keep the issues alive. A stale or\n\na dead issue/dispute cannot be revived even if such a representation has\n\nbeen decided either by the authority or by getting a direction from the\n\ncourt as the issue regarding delay and laches is to be decided with\n\nreference to original cause of action and not with reference to any such\n\norder passed. Delay and laches on the part of a government servant may\n\n 6 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 7\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\ndeprive him of the benefit which had been given to others. \nArticle 14\n of\n\nthe Constitution of India, in a situation of that nature, will not be\n\nattracted as it is well known that law leans in favour of those who are\n\nalert and vigilant. Even equality has to be claimed at the right juncture\n\nand not on expiry of reasonable time. Even if there is no period\n\nprescribed for filing the writ petition under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\nConstitution of India, yet it should be filed within a reasonable time. An\n\norder promoting a junior should\n should normally be challenged within a period\n\nof six months or at the most in a year of such promotion. Though it is\n\nnot a strict rule, the courts can always interfere even subsequent thereto,\n\nbut relief to a person, who allows things to happen and then approa\n approach\n\nthe court and puts forward a stale claim and try to unsettle settled\n\nmatters, can certainly be refused on account of delay and laches.\n\nAnyone who sleeps over his rights is bound to suffer. An employee who\n\nsleeps like Rip Van Winkle and got up from slumb\n slumber at his own leisure,\n\ndeserves to be denied the relief on account of delay and laches.\n\nRelevant paragraphs from the aforesaid judgment are extracted below:\n\n \"13. We have no trace of doubt that the respondents could\n have challenged the ad hoc promotion conf\n conferred on the\n junior employee at the relevant time. They chose not to do\n so for six years and the junior employee held the\n promotional post for six years till regular promotion took\n place. The submission of the learned counsel for the\n respondents is that they\n ey had given representations at the\n relevant time but the same fell in deaf ears. It is interesting\n to note that when the regular selection took place, they\n accepted the position solely because the seniority was\n maintained and, thereafter, they knocked at the doors of\n\n 7 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 8\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n the tribunal only in 2003. It is clear as noon day that the\n cause of action had arisen for assailing the order when the\n junior employee was promoted on ad hoc basis on\n 15.11.1983. \nIn \nC. Jacob v. Director of Geology and\n Mining and another\n, (2008) 10 SCC 115\n 115, a two-Judge\n Bench was dealing with the concept of representations and\n the directions issued by the court or tribunal to consider\n the representations and the challenge to the said rejection\n thereafter. In that context, the court has expre\n expressed thus:-\n\n \"Every representation to the Government for\n relief, may not be replied on merits. Representations\n relating to matters which have become stale or\n barred by limitation, can be rejected on that ground\n alone, without examining the merits of the cl\n claim. In\n regard to representations unrelated to the\n Department, the reply may be only to inform that the\n matter did not concern the Department or to inform\n the appropriate Department. Representations with\n incomplete particulars may be replied by seeking\n relevant\n evant particulars. The replies to such\n representations, cannot furnish a fresh cause of\n action or revive a stale or dead claim.\"\n\n 14. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n\n 15. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n\n 16.

Ghan\n Ghanshyam\n Dass\n (2) and others, (2011) 4 SCC 374\n 374, a three-Judge\n Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reiterated the\n principle stated in \nJagdish Lal v. State of Haryana\n, (1997)\n 6 SCC 538 and proceeded to observe that as the\n respondents therein preferred to sleep oover their rights and\n approached the tribunal in 1997, they would not get the\n benefit of the order dated 7.7.1992.\n\n 18. \nIn \nState of T.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX\n\n 20. \nIn \nNew Delhi Municipal Council v.

In the said case the\n respondents had filed the writ petition after seventeen\n years and thee court, as stated earlier, took note of the\n delay and laches as relevant factors and set aside the\n order passed by the High Court which had exercised the\n discretionary jurisdiction.\n\n12. \nIn a recent judgment by the Division Bench of this Court\n\nin \"\nRam Kumar\n Kumar vs State of Haryana and others\n\", 2022 (3) SCT 346,\n\nwhile rejecting the claim of the petitioner for counting of his ad hoc\n\nservice, for the purpose of seniority/pension and regularization in\n\nservice on completion of 02 years as per policy, held that the petition\n\nfiled by him suffered from gross, inordinate and unexplained delay in\n\n 9 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 10\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\napproaching the High Court. In \nthe said judgment\n, it has been held as\n\nunder:-\n\n \"10. What we wish to emphasize, in particular, is that\n services of the appellant were regularized w\n w.e.f.\n\n \n01.04.1997. And, he was assigned a specific seniority\n position in the cadre. Whereafter, he continued to serve the\n department for nearly twenty five years, before attaining\n the age of superannuation in January, 2022. Needless to\n assert that during alll these years, he availed all admissible\n benefits, promotions, and retired as Inspector. Thus, it\n rather appears that institution of the petition by the\n appellant was speculative and an attempt to resurrect a\n stale and dead claim. The Supreme Court, in \nNew Delhi\n Municipal Council v. Pan Singh & Ors.\n, 2007(9) SCC\n 278, observed:\n\n \"15. There is another aspect of the matter\n which cannot be lost sight of. Respondents herein\n filed a Writ Petition after 17 years. They did not\n agitate their grievances for a long ti\n time. They, as\n noticed herein, did not claim parity with the 17\n workmen at the earliest possible opportunity. They\n did not implead themselves as parties even in the\n reference made by the State before the Industrial\n Tribunal. It is not their case that after 11982, those\n employees who were employed or who were\n recruited after the cut-off\n off date have been granted\n the said scale of pay. \nAfter such a long time,\n therefore, the Writ Petitions could not have been\n entertained even if they are similarly situated. It is\n trite\n ite that the discretionary jurisdiction may not be\n exercised in favour of those who approach the Court\n after a long time. Delay and laches are relevant\n factors for exercise of equitable jurisdiction.

State of\n Haryana & Ors., (1997) 6 SCC 538\n 538, it was held by the\n Supreme Court:\n\n \"That apart, as this Court has repeatedly\n held, the delay disentitles the party to the\n discretionary relief under \nArticle 226\n or 32 of the\n Constitution. It is not necessar\n necessary to reiterate all\n catena of precedents in this behalf.

Therefore\n Therefore, desperate attempts of\n the appellants to re-do\n do the seniority had by them in\n various cadres/grades though in the same services\n according to 1974 Rules or 1980 Rule, are not\n amenable to judicial review at this belated stage....\"\n\n 12.

It is\n also the assertion made by counsel representing the\n petitioners that their claim would be covered in terms of\n decision dated 02.07.2013 rendered by this Court in a\n bunch of writ petitions\n etitions including CWP No.8083 of 1989\n titled as \nRadha Krishan Narang and others vs. State of\n Punjab and others\n.\n\n 4. Having heard counsel for the petitioners at length,\n this Court is of the considered view that the claim of the\n petitioners would not requiree any consideration on merits\n and the writ petition deserves to be dismissed on the sole\n ground of delay and laches.\n\n 5. Placed on record and appended at Annexure P\n P-1\n are the particulars of the petitioners. The tabulation at\n Annexure P-11 would show that all the petitioners stand\n retired on various dates between the years 1995 to 2012.\n Out of 32 petitioners in all, 22 petitioners superannuated\n more than 10 years back.\n\n 6. There is no justification coming forth as regards\n the inordinate delay in having appr\n approached the Writ Court.\n\n There is also no explanation put forth by the petitioners as\n to why the claim raised in the instant petition was not\n agitated by the petitioners while they were in service. The\n entire thrust of the submissions advanced by counsel is\n that similarly situated employees had approached this\n Court and have been granted relief.\n\n \n7. The issue regarding delay in invoking the\n extraordinary writ jurisdiction under \nArticle 226\n of the\n Constitution of India was considered by the Hon'ble\n\n 12 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 13\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n Supreme Court in \nChairman, U.P. Jal Nigam and another\n v. Jaswant Singh and another\n (2006)11 SCC 464\n\n \n464. In such\n case, certain employees raised the issue that they were not\n liable to be retired at the age of 58 years but should be\n permitted to continue in service till th\n they attain the age of\n 60 years. Such employees were still in service when the\n writ petitions were filed. The writ petitions were ultimately\n allowed. Placing reliance upon such judgment, some of the\n employees, who had already superannuated, filed writ\n petitions\n ons seeking the same benefit. Even such petitions\n were allowed by the High Court in terms of following the\n earlier judgment. The judgment of the High Court was\n challenged before the Apex Court and wherein while\n referring to earlier judgments in \nRup Diamonds v. Union\n of India\n, (1989)2 SCC 356; \"\nJagdish Lal v. State of\n Haryana\n, (\n1997)6 SCC 538 and Government of West\n Bengal v. Tarun K. Roy\n, (2004)1 SCC 347\n 347, it was opined\n that persons who approached the Court at a belated stage\n placing reliance upon the order ppassed in some other case\n earlier, can be denied the discretionary relief on the\n ground of delay and laches. The relevant observations\n made by the Supreme Court are contained in Paras 5, 6\n and 16 of the judgment and are extracted here under:\n\n under:-\n\n \n\"5. So far as the principal issue is\n concerned, that has been settled by this court.\n Therefore, there is no quarrel over the legal\n proposition. But the only question is grant of\n relief to such other persons who were not\n vigilant and did not wake up to challenge\n their retirement\n etirement and accepted the same but\n filed writ petitions after the judgment of this\n court in \nHarwindra Kumar v. Chief\n Engineer, Karmik\n, (2005) 13 SCC 300 300.\n Whether they are entitled to same relief or not?\n Therefore, a serious question that arises for\n consideration\n eration is whether the employees who\n did not wake up to challenge their retirement\n\n 13 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 14\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n and accepted the same, collected their post post-\n retirement benefits, can such persons be given\n the relief in the light of the subsequent\n decision delivered by this court?\n\n 6. Thee question of delay and laches has\n been examined by this court in a series of\n decisions and laches and delay has been\n considered to be an important factor in\n exercise of the discretionary relief under\n \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. When a\n person who is not ot vigilant of his rights and\n acquiesces with the situation, can his writ\n petition be heard after a couple of years on\n the ground that same relief should be granted\n to him as was granted to person similarly\n situated who was vigilant about his rights and\n challenged\n allenged his retirement which was said to\n be made on attaining the age of 58 years. A\n chart has been supplied to us in which it has\n been pointed out that about 9 writ petitions\n were filed by the employees of the Nigam\n before their retirement wherein their\n retirement was somewhere between 30.6.2005\n and 31.7.2005. Two writ petitions were filed\n wherein no relief of interim order was passed.\n They were granted interim order. Thereafter a\n spate of writ petitions followed in which\n employees who retired in the year years 2001,\n 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, woke up to file\n writ petitions in 2005 and 2006 much after\n their retirement. Whether such persons should\n be granted the same relief or not?\n\n xx xx xx\n\n 16. Therefore, in case at this belated stage if\n similar relief is to be given to the persons who\n have not approached the court that will\n unnecessarily overburden the Nigam and the\n Nigam will completely collapse with the\n liability of payment to these persons in terms\n of two years' salary and increased benefit of\n pension and other her consequential benefits.\n Therefore, we are not inclined to grant any\n relief to the persons who have approached the\n court after their retirement. Only those\n\n 14 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 15\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n persons who have filed the writ petitions\n when they were in service or who have\n obtained interim order for their retirement,\n those persons should be allowed to stand to\n benefit and not others.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n \n8. The issue of delay was also dealt with by this\n Court in \nTarsem Pal vs. Punjab State Power Corporation\n Limited and others\n, 2013 (3) SLR 314.\n \nIn the case of\n \nTarsem Pal\n (supra), the petitioner was serving as a Clerk\n with the respondent-Corporation\n Corporation and had retired on\n 31.03.2005. Claim in the writ petition was to grant to him\n the benefit of proficiency set up in the pay scale on\n completion of 23 years of service from the due date as per\n policy of the Corporation. During the service career, he\n had not agitated the claim for increments. For the first\n time, such claim had been made on 28.02.2005 i.e. just\n one month prior to superannuation. While nnon-suiting the\n petitioner on account of delay and laches it was held as\n follows:-\n\n \"11. In the aforesaid judgments, it has\n been clearly laid down that discretionary\n relief in a writ jurisdiction is available to a\n party who is alive of his rights and enforc\n enforces\n the same in court within reasonable time. The\n judgment in another case does not give a\n cause of action to file a writ petition at a\n belated stage seeking the same relief. Such\n petitions can be dismissed on account of\n delay and laches. As has already bee\n been noticed\n above in the present case as well, the\n petitioner joined service in the year 1965 and\n retired in the year 2005, but raised the issue\n regarding benefit of proficiency step up in the\n pay scale on completion of 23 years of service\n from the due date more than five years after\n his retirement referring to a judgment of this\n court and filed the petition claiming the same\n relief.\n\n 15 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 16\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n 12. The petitioner retired from service\n on 31.3.2005 and the claim pertaining to the\n benefit of proficiency step up, which may be\n admissible to the petitioner during his service\n career, was sought to be raised more than five\n years after his retirement, the claim made at\n such a late stage deserves to be dismissed on\n account of delay and laches only. The\n petitioner could raise a gr\n grievance about the\n pay scales admissible to him or the last pay\n drawn by him within a reasonable time after\n his retirement. He cannot be permitted to\n raise the same at any time on the plea that the\n same is recurring cause of action.\n\n \n13. Considering the enu\n enunciation of law,\n as \nreferred to above\n, in my opinion, the\n petitioner herein is not entitled to the relief\n prayed for and the petition deserves to be\n dismissed merely on account of delay and\n laches.\"\n\n \n9. At this stage, counsel appearing for the\n petitioners would make an attempt to overcome the\n obstacle of delay by placing reliance upon a Full Bench\n Judgment of this Court in \nSaroj Kumar vs. State of\n Punjab\n, 1998(3) SCT 664.. Counsel would argue that as\n per dictum \nlaid down in\n \nSaroj Kumar\n's case(supra),\n matters of pay fixation involve a recurring cause of action\n and as such, writ petitions for such claim cannot be\n dismissed on the ground of delay and laches and the Court\n at the most, may restrict the arrears upto 38 months from\n the date of filing of the petition and disallow the arrears\n for the period for which even a suit had become time\n barred.\n\n \n10. The reliance placed by counsel upon the\n judgment in \nSaroj Kumar\n's case, is wholly misplaced.\n \nThe\n observations and aspect of delay in \nSaroj Kumar\n's case,\n were in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n \nM.R. Gupta vs. Union of India and others\n, 1995(4) RSJ\n\n 16 of 29\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 11-01-2025 00:54:33 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:170845\n\n 17\n\nCWP-17178\n 17178 of 2018 (O&M)\n\n \n502.. In \nM.R. Gupta\n's case(supra), it had been\n categorically held that so long as an employee \"is in\n service\" a fresh cause of action arises every month whe\n when\n he is getting his monthly salary on the basis of a wrong\n calculation made contrary to rules. It was further held that\n the claim to be awarded the correct salary on the basis of\n a proper pay fixation \"is a right which subsists during the\n entire tenure of service\".\n\n 11. In the present case, however the petitioners\n choose not to agitate their claim while in service. It is\n much subsequent to their superannuation that they have\n woken up and seek to gain impetus from certain\n decisions that may have been rendere\n rendered in the case of\n similarly situated employees.\n\n \n12. Considering the dictum of law as \nlaid down in\n\nChariman, U.P. Jal Nigam\n's case (supra), the petitioners\n herein are not entitled to any releif as prayed for and the\n petition deserves to be dismissed on the sole ground of\n delay and laches.\n\n 13. Ordered accordingly.\"\n\n14. The Division Bench of this Court in\n in\"\nH.S. Gill vs Union of\n\nIndia and others\n\", 2016(2) SCT 477,, has held that an employee cannot\n\nclaim the revised pay scale after retirement once he has been receiving\n\nthe pay scale granted by the employer for the last 09 years. The\n\nrelevant portion from \nthe said judgment\n, reads as under:\n\n under:-\n\n \"14. The petitioner is also not entitled to any relief\n on account of principle of delay and laches. He has been\n receiving the pay in the pay scale of Rs.6500\n Rs.6500-10500 right\n from his transfer to CSIO, Chandigarh i.e. 2.7.2002.

By majority judgment, the\n larger bench held that the service rendered by an\n employee on the basis of adhoc appointment must\n be clubbed with his regular service for the purpose\n of grant of selection grade in terms of the policy\n framed by the State Government.
