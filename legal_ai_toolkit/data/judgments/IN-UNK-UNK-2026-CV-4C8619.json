In other words, can pensions be changed (particularly, when the\nchange is to the detriment of the employees concerned) without recourse to\nthe proper procedure prescribed for changing them?\n\nThis group of appeals by special leave raises the same issues of facts and\nlaw for a decision by this Court. Hence, they can all be dealt with by a\ncommon judgment. For the sake of convenience, the facts shall be mentioned\nfrom the appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Civil) Nos.\n3759-3760/04.\n\nA Survey of the Facts\n\nThese appeals have been filed by a registered Trade Union, which represents\nnearly 30,000 employees of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (\"the Board\").\nPrior to 1.7.57, the State of Tamil Nadu was departmentally carrying on the\nwork of distribution and supply of electric energy. On 1.7.57, the Board\nwas constituted by the State Government under \nChapter III of the\nElectricity (Supply) Act, 1948\n (\"the 1948 Act\"). The employees of the Board\nconsisted of two different classes: (i) Employees who were already employed\nby the State Government and were taken over into the service of the Board\nupon its constitution; and (ii) Employees directly recruited by the Board\nafter its constitution. In exercise of its powers under \nSection 79(c)\n of\nthe 1948 Act, the Board brought into force a set of regulations styled as\nthe \"Tamil Nadu Electricity Board Liberalised Pension Regulations, 1960\"\n\n(\"1960 Regulations\") with effect from 1.7.60. These Regulations dealt with\nthe conditions of service specifically pension and death-cum-retirement\ngratuity. Under \nRegulation 3\n of the 1960 Regulations, the qualifying\nservice for earning pension was a period of thirty years.\n\nThe 1960 Regulations also contained a Savings Clause incorporated in\n\nRegulation 9\n, which reads as under:\n\n9. SAVING\n\n(i) No provision in the Civil Service Regulations shall, so far as it\nis inconsistent with any of the provisions of these regulations have any\neffect.\n\n(ii) Save as otherwise provided in these regulations, the provisions in\nthese regulations, shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the\nprovisions in the Civil Service Regulations as amended from time to time by\nthe Government of Tamil Nadu.\"\n\nThe Board had its own Pension and Provident Fund Schemes, which, in the\nopinion of the State of Tamil Nadu, gave to the employees benefits which\nwere on the whole not-less-favourable than the benefits provided under the\n\nEmployees' Provident Fund Act, 1952\n or the Employees Provident Fund Scheme,\n1952. Hence, the State Government by Government Order (\"G.O.\") No. 988\n(dated 13.7.70) exempted, under \nSection 17(1)(b)\n of the Employees'\nProvident Fund Act, 1952, the establishment of the Board from the operation\nof all the provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme, 1952 framed\nunder the provisions of the \nEmployees' Provident Fund Act, 1952\n. The\nexemption was, however, subject to the conditions specified in the G.O.\nitself.\n\nFurther, by Central Government notification dated 25.6.1986, exemption\nunder \nSection 17(14)\n of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous\nProvisions Act, 1952, was granted from the operation of all the provisions\nof the Employees' Family Pension Scheme, 1971 on the ground that the\nbenefits in the nature of Family Pension under the Tamil Nadu Electricity\nBoard Employees' Family Pension Regulations, 1964 (\"Family Pension\nRegulations, 1964\") were not-less-favourable than the benefits provided\nunder the Employees Family Pension Scheme, 1971. While granting this\nexemption, a specific condition was imposed by clause (4) enumerated to the\nSchedule to the notification, which reads as under:\n\n\"(4) No amendment to the provision of the said regulations shall be made\nwithout the prior approval of the Central Provident Fund Commissioner and\nthere (sic) any amendment is likely to affect adversely the interest of the\nemployees of the Board the Central Provident Fund Commissioner shall before\ngiving his approval give reasonable opportunity to the employees to explain\ntheir view-point.\"\n\nSimilar exemption was granted by the Central Government (by another\nnotification dated 25.6.86) from the provisions of the Employees' Deposit\nLinked Insurance Scheme, 1976, on the same ground (i.e. that the Board's\nFamily Benefits Subsidiary Scheme provided no-less-favourable benefits to\nthe employees), but again subject to a condition of a similar nature.\n\nOn 26.6.86, after the workers made representations, the Board passed a\nresolution (numbered B.P.Ms (F.B.) No. 5) by which it ordered that all the\nRegular Work Establishment Workmen retiring/ expiring on or after 1.7.86\nwould be governed by the pension scheme of the Board. On 17.2.95, the Board\npassed a resolution (No. B.P. (F.B.) No. 7) which amended \nRegulation 9\n of\nthe 1960 Regulations. In the proceedings of the Board it was pointed out\nthat, since the formation of the Board on 1.7.57 till the Board's 1960\nRegulations came into force, the employees of the Board were governed only\nby the Civil Service Regulations with respect to quantum of pension, death-\ncum-retirement gratuity etc. After the framing of the 1960 Regulations and\nthe Family Pension Regulations, 1964, the provisions of the said\nRegulations which were not inconsistent with the Civil Service Regulations\nwere followed. In addition, the provisions of the Civil Service\nRegulations, with respect to matters not specifically governed by the\nBoard's regulations, were also applicable.\n\nWith a view to creating a complete Pension Code, the Tamil Nadu Government\nframed the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules (brought into force with effect from\n18.7.76) and the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 (brought into force with\neffect from 1.1.79). These Rules replaced the Civil Service Regulations,\nMadras Liberalised Pension Rules, 1960 and the Tamil Nadu Government\nServants Family Pension Rules, 1964.\n\nIt has also been pointed out in the Board's Proceedings that the Board\nhaving followed the Civil Service Regulations, in addition to the 1960\nRegulations and the Family Pension Regulations, 1964, had also been\nfollowing the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, and the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules,\n1978 for settling the terminal benefits of the retiring employees of the\nBoard. It was noted that the amendments made from time to time in the Tamil\nNadu Pension Rules and Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 were also being\nfollowed by the Board in the light of the saving provisions contained in\n\nRegulation 9\n of the 1960 Regulations. The Board, \"having considered the\nmatter carefully\", decided that it was necessary to amend \nRegulation 9\n of\nthe 1960 Regulations \"so as to follow the provisions of the Pension Rules\nof the Tamil Nadu Government\". Towards this end, the Board decided to amend\n\nRegulation 9\n by exercising its powers under \nSection 79(c)\n of the\nElectricity (Supply) Act, 1948. \nRegulation 9\n was amended by substituting a\nnew regulation as under:\n\n\"9 SAVING\n\n(i) No provision in the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules and Tamil Nadu Pension\nRules, 1978, shall, so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions\nof these regulations have any effect.\n\n(ii) Save as otherwise provided in these regulations, the provisions in\nthese regulations, shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the\nprovisions in the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules and Tamil Nadu Pension Rules,\n1978, as amended from time to time by the Government of Tamil Nadu.\"\n\nThese amendments were directed to take effect respectively from 18.7.76 and\n1.1.79.\n\nOn 8.7.98, a Memorandum of Settlement under \nSection 18(1)\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 was reached between the Board and its workmen. Although\nthe settlement pertained to several conditions of service,1 we propose to\nexamine only the most relevant clauses.\n\nClause 14 of the settlement provides that a settlement under \nSection 12(3)\n\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 would be secured immediately on wage\nrevision and on workload revision, after settlement of revisions of work\nnorms. By Clause 17, the settlement was to be in force for a period of four\nyears with effect from 1.12.96. Despite this period having expired, we are\ninformed by the counsels on both sides that the settlement was not formally\nterminated under \nSection 19(2)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Clause\n15 of the said settlement is of some importance and reads as under:\n\n\"15. IT IS ALSO AGREED THAT:\n\n(i) The contract Labourers in thermal stations will be paid wages with\neffect from 1.4.1997 with reference to settlement dated 21.7.1997. With\neffect from 16.4.1998 according to the orders of the High Court in Writ\nAppeal No. 1373 of 1993 will be implemented.\n\n(ii) The contract labourers employed on daily wages in Distribution,\nGeneration and other Circles will be paid wages according to the PWD\nschedule of rates with effect from 1.7.1998.\n\n(iii) The revised pension scheme of the Government of Tamil Nadu and any\namendments there on from time to time will be applied to the pensioners of\nthe Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nWhile the conditions of service of the employees of the Board remained\nthus, G.O. No. 71 was issued by the Government of Tamil Nadu on 19.3.03,\nwhich purported to revise downwards various benefits accorded to Government\nServants. This was on the ground that pension payments and other benefits\nhad \"reached a level far higher than any other State in India\" and had,\ntherefore, become \"fiscally unsustainable\". Through the G.O., the State\nGovernment directed that the maximum Qualifying service be enhanced to\nthirty-three years from thirty years in order to become eligible for full\npension by Government Servants after retirement. It also directed through\nthe said G.O. that pension would be determined on the basis of the average\nemoluments drawn during the last ten months of service rendered only. These\namendments were directed to become operative in respect of Government\nservants retiring on or after 1.4.03.\n\nBy another G.O. No. 74 dated 19.3.03, for identical reasons, the State\nGovernment directed that the maximum limit for commutation of portion of\npension by the pensioner would be 33 1/3% of pension only. This order also\ntook effect from 1.4.03.\n\nFollowing the amendments made by the State Government to the Pension Rules,\nthe Board by its Resolution B.P. (Ch) No. 64 (dated 31.3.03) brought about\ncorresponding changes in the rules of pension applicable to its employees.\nThis Board Proceeding is the crucial one and necessitates reproduction in\nits entirety.\n\n\"Tamil Nadu Electricity Board\n\nAbstract\n\nPension-Qualifying Service for pension and calculation of pension Revised\norders-Issued.\n\nSECRETARIAT BRANCH\n\n(Per.)

It\n has also been ordered therein that pension shall be determined\n based on 50% of average emoluments drawn during the last 10 months\n service rendered or 50% of pay last drawn (sic) Board employee,\n whichever is higher.\n\n2. The Government have (sic) now issued orders in the Government Order\nsecond cited enhancing the maximum qualifying service to 33 years from 30\nyears to become eligible for full pension by the Government Servants after\nretirement. The Government have (sic) also ordered that Pension shall be\ndetermined based on the average emoluments drawn during the last 10 months\nof service rendered only.\n\n3. The provisions in the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules 1978 have been made\napplicable to the employees of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board also by an\namendment to \nRegulation 9\n of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board Liberalised\nPension Regulations 1960. It has, therefore, become necessary to adopt the\norders relating to Government Pensioners to the pensioners of the Board.\n\nAdoption of Government orders in respect of pensionery benefits does not\nattract the issue of notice under \nSection 9A\n of Industrial Dispute Act,\n1947.\n\n4. Based on the orders of the Governments mentioned in para-2 above, the\nTamil Nadu Electricity Board hereby directs that the maximum qualifying\nservice be enhanced to 33 years from 30 years to become eligible for full\npension by the Board employees after retirement.\n\n5. The Board also directs that pension shall be determined based on the\naverage emoluments drawn during the last 10 months of service rendered\nonly.\n\n6.

(Ch) No. 65 (dated 31.3.2003)\nand B.P. (Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.3.2003), commutation level for pension was\nsubstantially revised downwards.\n\nThe Proceedings in the High Court\n\nThe Appellant-Trade Union filed Writ Petition Nos. 11899, 11900 and\n11902/2003 before the High Court of Judicature at Madras challenging these\nthree orders (i.e. B.P. (Ch.) Nos.64-66) of the Board. It was contended by\nthe Trade Union that the Board being a Statutory Board was not required to\nmechanically follow the G.O.s and, in any event, the action of the Board\nadversely affecting the pensions of employees was unfair, arbitrary and\nunconstitutional.\n\nAround the same time, similar writ petitions (W.P. No. 11228/2003 etc.)\nwere moved by Government servants (The Madras High Court Staff\nAssociation). These sought to impugn the changes brought about in their\npensionary conditions by G.O. Nos. 71 to 74. A Division Bench of the High\nCourt of Madras dismissed their Writ Petitions (through order dated\n23.10.03). A survey of this judgment becomes necessary because it is\nheavily relied upon while disposing off the present impugned judgment.\n\nThe High Court in its order dated 23.10.03 held that the action of the\nGovernment in G.O. Nos. 71 to 74 was motivated by financial constraints and\nwas, therefore, not arbitrary. It observed that the cut-off date of 1.4.03\nfor the revised pension package was not arbitrary since only the terminal\nbenefits of future retirees were being affected and that no accrued rights\nwere affected. Moreover, the High Court held that the Government could\nalter the service conditions of its employees in exercise of its powers\nunder \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India. However, the High Court set\naside G.O. Nos. 72 and 73 by which the State Government increased the\ndiscount rate of commutation of pension and curtailed the encashment of\nleave on retirement on the ground that these were accrued rights which\ncould not be prejudicially affected by the Government.\n\nNow for the present impugned judgment. Following its own judgment in W.P.\nNo. 11228/2003 (dated 23.10.03) etc., the High Court of Madras decided W.P.\nNos. 11899, 11900 and 11902/2003 along with a batch of connected matters,2\nfiled by a large number of employees through order dated 23.10.03 (\"the\nimpugned judgment\"). The impugned judgment held inter alia as under:\n\n1. That the Settlement (dated 8.7.98) between the Board and its employees\nprovided for revised pension schemes of the Government to be applied to the\nBoard's pensioners and hence no prior notice under \nSection 9A\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947 was necessary.\n\n2. \nRegulation 9\n of the 1960 Regulations as amended by B.P. No. 7 (dated\n17.12.95), provided for the adoption of the Pension Rules of the Government\nas amended from time to time.\n\n3. The Board's Service Regulation No.17 did not provide for payment of\npension and hence the qualifying service of 30 years mentioned therein\ncould not be relied upon.\n\n4. Since G.O.Ms Nos. 71 and 74 have been upheld for Government servants\n(vide Madras High Court order in W.P. No. 11228/2003 dated 23.10.03), B.P.\nNos. 64 and 66, which rely upon them, are valid.\n\n5. Since G.O. No. 73 enhancing the rate of commuted pension was set aside\n(vide Madras High Court order in W.P. No. 11228/03 dated 23.10.03), B.P.\nNo. 65 based thereon was illegal.\n\nThe Appellant-Trade Union is before this Court in appeal on behalf of the\nemployees of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board to challenge the impugned\njudgment.\n\nThe Facts in the Connected Special Leave Petitions\n\nCivil Appeals arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 4598-4599/04 are filed by the\nTamil Nadu Electricity Board Accounts and Executive Staff Union on behalf\nof the Accounts and Executive staff who are aggrieved by the disposal of\ntheir Writ Petitions Nos. 11565 and 11567 of 2003 by common order of the\nHigh Court of Madras (dated 23.10.03 in W.P. 10727/03 etc).\n\nCivil Appeals arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 4750-4751/04 are filed by the\nTrade Union representing the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board Stores Union\naggrieved by the dismissal of their Writ Petitions Nos. 11937 and 12372 of\n2003 by common order of the High Court of Madras dated 23.10.03 in W.P.\n10727/03 etc.\n\nCivil Appeals arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 16305-16306/04 are filed by the\nTamil Nadu Electricity Workers Federation challenging the impugned common\njudgment in dismissing their Writ Petitions Nos. 12349 and 12351 of 2003 by\ncommon order of the High Court of Madras dated 23.10.03 in W.P. 10727/03\netc.\n\nCivil Appeals arising out of S.L.P.(C) Nos. 8882-8883/04 are filed by the\nTamil Nadu Electricity Board Workers Progressive Union challenging the\nimpugned common judgment dated 23.10.03 in W.P. 10727/03 etc insofar as it\ndismisses their Writ Petitions Nos. 11935 and 12370 of 2003.\n\nThe Contentions\n\nMs. Indira Jaising, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-employees, who\nled the arguments on behalf of the appellants, raised several contentions,\narguing on construction of the regulations and the settlement, and on\nconstitutional grounds.\n\nMs. Jaising's contention on the construction of the Regulation was that the\nBoard had reduced the pensionary benefits through executive orders without\namending 1960 Regulations, an action which Ms. Jaising contends is ultra\nvires the powers of the Board.\n\nTurning to the Settlement (dated 8.7.98) between the Board and its\nemployees, she urged that Clause 15(iii) did not have the effect of\nrendering the amendments to the pension scheme of the State Government\nemployees automatically applicable to the employees of the Board.\nConsequently, Ms. Jaising contended that the only method by which the Board\ncould have adversely affected the pension regulations applicable to its\nemployees was by the process of formal amendment of its regulations, which\nadmittedly has not been done.\n\nShe further contended that Clause 15(iii) of the Settlement could not be\ntreated as a waiver of the \"fundamental rights\" of the employees as there\nwas no conscious agreement discernible in the Settlement to reduce the\npensionary benefits. In her submission, the High Court erred in\ninterpreting \nRegulation 9(ii)\n of the 1960 Regulations as amended.\n\nMs. Jaising made two broad submissions on Constitutional grounds to\nquestion the action of the Board. Her first broad contention was with\nregard to the legal nature of pensions. Relying on several authorities of\nthis Court, she contended that pension is an accrued right, which could not\nbe taken away, that too by a mere executive action such as a resolution of\nthe Respondent-Board. She also contended that pension is in the nature of\nproperty and it cannot be taken away except by procedure established by law\nas provided under \nArticle 300A\n consistent with \nArticle 14\n of the\nConstitution of India.\n\nMs. Jaising's second broad contention was that the action of the Board was\n\"unreasonable\" and hence violative of \nArticle 14.\n Relying upon a judgment\nof this Court in D. S. Nakara and Ors. v. Union of India,3 (\"Nakara\") she\ncontended that the revision of the formula of the rate of pension in the\nexisting scheme makes an invidious distinction between those retired before\nor after the cut-off date resulting in unequal treatment being meted out to\nthe two groups.\n\nMr. Ramamoorthy, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Board attempted\nto sustain the impugned judgment by advancing the reasoning of the High\nCourt.\n\nPrinciple of Waiver and the Settlement\n\nIn our view, Clause 15(iii) of the Settlement (dated 8.7.98) merely\nmollifies the rigour of requirement of advance notice of 15 days under\n\nSection 9A\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Ms. Jaising contended that\nthe conditions of service once settled can never be changed except by being\nsubstituted by a fresh settlement or award. This may be true with regard to\nconditions of service, which have been settled by a binding settlement/\naward. With regard to matters which are in the realm of virgin territory,\nwe are afraid that this may not be the rule. In fact, we called upon Ms.\nJaising to show as to which provision of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act\n, other\nthan \nSection 9A\n, prohibits the change by an employer of a condition of\nservice that it was not brought about by a settlement or award. No such\nprovision was cited before us.\n\nWe are, hence, unable to accept the contention of Ms. Jaising that the\nBoard could not have changed, by executive action, even those conditions of\nservice that were not the subject matter of regulations, a settlement or an\naward. In our judgment, Clause 15(iii) of the Settlement merely operates to\nexempt the employer (the Board) from giving a notice under \nSection 9A\n of\nthe Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.\n\nIt was not pleaded by the Board before the High Court, nor was it so held\nby the High Court in the impugned judgment, that there was any waiver of\nrights generally by reason of the said clause in the said Settlement.\nNeither we are inclined to accept such an argument, nor did the learned\ncounsel for the Board advance any such argument before us. The argument\nwith reference to the principle of waiver is, therefore, wholly irrelevant\nand need not detain us. This takes us to the interpretation of \nRegulation 9\n\nof the 1960 Regulations and its true import.\n\nThe 1960 Pension Regulations\n\nThis case really turns on the interpretation of the pension regulations,\nparticularly \nRegulation 9\n of the 1960 Regulations. In considering the\nimport of \nRegulation 9\n of the 1960 Regulations (amended on 17.2.95) a\nhistorical overview is crucial. After the constitution of the Board in the\nyear 1957, a set of employees, erstwhile State Government's servants were\ntaken over in the employment of the Board. They were governed by the Civil\nService Regulations inter alia with regard to their pensionary benefits.\n\nThus, when the 1960 Regulations were brought into force on 1.7.60, the\nBoard had in its employment the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Government servants as\nwell as employees directly recruited by it. A saving clause was necessary\nin order to ensure that the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Government servants (who\nwere taken over into the service of the Board) were not adversely affected\nby framing of the Regulations. Consequently, a Saving Clause was\nintroduced, vide \nRegulation 9\n.\n\nThis saving clause (as it stood before the amendment of 17.2.95) was in two\nparts. Clause (i) ensured that no provision in the Civil Service\nRegulations to the extent of its inconsistency with any of the provisions\nof the 1960 Regulations would have any effect. This was obviously intended\nto ensure that whatever better benefits were available to the employees of\nthe Board would be protected even if the Civil Service Regulations were\ninconsistent with the Board's Regulations.\n\nClause (ii) specifically provided that the provisions made in the\nRegulations would be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions\nin the Civil Service Regulations as amended from time to time by the\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu. The import of this clause was that, except as\notherwise provided in the 1960 Regulations, with regard to matters not\ncovered by the Civil Service Regulations, the 1960 Regulations would have\nto be read additionally and not so as to derogate from the Civil Service\nRegulations. In other words, the intention declared by clause (ii) is that\nthe persons covered by the Civil Service Regulations would be entitled to\nthe benefits thereunder and also to the benefits flowing from the 1960\nRegulations.\n\nIn 1995, however, the Board proposed to amend \nRegulation 9\n as it stood. The\npreambulatory portion in the Board Proceedings (B.P. (FB) No. 7 dated\n17.2.95) clearly sets forth the reasons, which motivated the Board to amend\n\nRegulation 9\n. This became necessary, because in the period after the 1960\nregulations were first operative, the State Government had replaced the\nthen existent Civil Service Regulations with the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules\nand Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978. Correspondingly, by the 1995 amendment,\nthe expression \"Civil Service Regulations\" in \nRegulation 9\n was replaced by\n\"Tamil Nadu Pension Rules\" and \"Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978\". \nRegulation\n9(ii)\n was also amended on the same lines. However, there were no other\nchanges either formal or substantive in \nRegulation 9\n. The amended\n\nRegulation 9\n took effect from the dates on which the Tamil Nadu Pension\nRules and Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 were brought into force (i.e.\n18.7.76 and 1.1.79 respectively).\n\nIn our view, the amended \nRegulation 9\n only makes explicit with reference to\nthe Tamil Nadu Pension Rules and Tamil Nadu Pension Rules, 1978 what was\nalready provided for in the unamended \nRegulation 9\n, which referred to the\nCivil Service Regulations. A reading of the Board Proceeding (B.P. (FB) No.\n7 dated 17.2.95) makes it clear that since the formation of the Board on\n1.7.57 till the 1960 Regulations came into force, the employees of the\nBoard were governed only by the provisions of the Civil Service Regulations\ninter alia with respect to quantum of pension, death-cum-retirement\ngratuity. After the Board framed its 1960 Regulations and the Family\nPension Regulations, 1964, the provisions of these Regulations, which were\nnot inconsistent with the Civil Service Regulations, were followed \"in\naddition to the provisions of the Civil Service Regulations with respect to\nmatters not specifically governed by the Board's Regulations.\"\n\nThe said Board Proceedings also make it clear that once the Civil Service\nRegulations were replaced by the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules and Tamil Nadu\nPension Rules, 1978, those were followed for settling the terminal benefits\nof retiring employees of the Board. Similarly, according to the Board\nProceedings, the amendments made from time to time in the aforesaid Rules\nof the State Government were also being applied to the retiring employees\nof the Board \"in the light of the saving provision contained in \nRegulation\n9\n of the 1960 Regulations.\" As we have previously discussed, the Board\nProceedings indicate that the 1995 amendment to \nRegulation 9\n was only\nintended to take into account the State Government's action of replacing\nthe Civil Service Regulations with the Tamil Nadu Pension Rules and Tamil\nNadu Pension Rules, 1978.\n\nThe real question before us is: whether the Board could have followed the\nState Government's pension amendments by merely changing \nRegulation 9\n. It\nappears to us that the decision taken by the Board to amend its own pension\nrules and bring it in line with those applicable to the Government's\nservants was per se unexceptionable; however, this could not have been\nachieved by a mere amendment in \nRegulation 9\n as seems to have prevailed in\nthe opinion of the Board.\n\nMs. Jaising is right in her contention that the purpose and purport of\n\nRegulation 9\n was to ensure, firstly, that the State Government employees\ntaken over in the service of the Board were not prejudiced with regard to\ntheir conditions of service, particularly pension and death-cum-retirement\ngratuity. Secondly, the saving clause ensures that with regard to matters\nwhich were not covered by the State Government rules but covered by the\nBoard's Regulations, the benefit covered under the Board Regulations would\nbe in addition to and not in derogation of what was already available in\nthe Civil Service Regulations. It was open to the Board in exercise of its\nstatutory powers under \nSection 79(c)\n of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948\nto amend its pension regulations in such manner as to bring it precisely in\nline with the Tamil Nadu Government Rules with regard to pension and other\nbenefits as applicable to the State Government employees. Instead of\nexpressly amending the Regulations, the Board appears to have fallen back\non \nRegulation 9\n, which was merely a saving clause intended to insulate the\nemployees against erosion of their benefits granted in the provisions.\n\nWhether such an amendment could have been successfully challenged on its\nsubstantive merits is not a question with which we are concerned. We are\nonly concerned with whether the Board could have straightaway imported\nwholesale the provisions of the pension rules applicable to the State\nGovernment employees via the vehicle of the saving clause, \nRegulation 9\n.\nOur answer to this issue is clearly in the negative because such a\npossibility is evidently absent in the text of the said Regulation. For\nthis reason, we are of the view that the conditions of service pertaining\nto pension that were already the subject matter of the Regulations could\nnot have been changed by the Board without amending the Regulations in\naccordance with law.\n\nQuantifying and Qualifying for Pensions\n\nAs under \nRegulation 3\n of the 1960 Regulations, the qualifying service for\nfull pension was initially prescribed as thirty years. It was only by Board\nProceedings B.P.(Ch) No. 64 (dated 31.3.03) that the maximum qualifying\nservice for pension was increased from thirty years to thirty-three years.\nBy the same Board's Proceedings, the pension was made relatable to the\naverage emoluments drawn during the last ten months service instead of the\nlast drawn pay. These two aspects were the subject matters of the 1960\nRegulations and, therefore, by a Board Proceeding, without amending the\nRegulations, they could not have been modified to the prejudice of the\nemployees. B.P.(Ch) No. 64 (dated 31.3.03) is, therefore, bad in law and\nillegal inasmuch as it purports to bring about adverse changes in the\nquantification of pensions and the qualifying period of service for\npensions.\n\nCommutation of Pension\n\nWe need to, however, draw a distinction between two different situations\nwhich have arisen, namely: (i) an attempt by the Board to withdraw certain\nbenefits granted by a decision of the Board (without amending the\napplicable regulations) by another Board decision, (ii) the other situation\nis where a benefit granted under the 1960 Regulations was sought to be\ntaken away by a Board's decision (without amending the applicable\nregulations). As have seen in the previous situations discussed, the latter\nis clearly impermissible. We, however, need to consider the former issue.\n\nA change brought about by the Board that has also been impugned is with\nregard to the decrease in the maximum permissible commutation of pension\nfrom 40% to 33 1/3% by following G.O. No. 74 (dated 19.3.03) issued by the\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu. As far as this change is concerned, it would\nappear that \nRegulation 7\n as framed in 1960 permitted a maximum commutation\nof one-third. By a Board Proceeding B.P.(Ch) No. 208 (dated 18.8.98), the\ncommutation percentage was increased to 40%. This has now been reduced to\n33 1/3% by another Board Proceeding B.P. (Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.3.03). In\nother words, what was granted by a Board Proceeding, without amending the\nRegulations, is sought to be taken away by another Board Proceeding with a\nview to following G.O.Ms. No. 74 (dated 19.3.03) issued by the State\nGovernment in respect of its own employees. As far as this change is\nconcerned, the argument of not following the proper procedure (i.e.\namending the Regulations) does not apply. In fact, the change made by\nB.P.(Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.3.03) actually brings the level of commutation to\nwhat was originally given by the 1960 Regulations. In our view, what was\ngranted by a mere Board Proceeding could be validly altered by another\nBoard Proceeding. Therefore, the challenge to the change in the commutation\npercentage brought about by B.P.(Ch) No. 66 fails by the same token.\n\nMs. Jaising further contended that, with regard to the reduction in the\npercentage of maximum commutation of pension, the employees who were\ncovered by the provisions of the \nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n would be\nentitled to raise an industrial dispute, and have it adjudicated according\nto law. She also submitted that, if this Court were to hold against the\nemployees on the point of commutation of pension, some time may be\npermitted to the employees to raise an industrial dispute with regard to\nthe change. Considering that the change is likely to have an impact on a\nlarge number of employees of the Board, we are inclined to give reasonable\ntime to the employees to raise an industrial dispute before the change\nimpacts them.\n\nThe Constitutional Grounds\n\nTurning to Ms. Jaising's first argument on constitutional grounds, it\nappears to us that even if pension is \"property\", all that \nArticle 300A\n\nprovides is that: \"No person shall be deprived of his property save by\nauthority of law.\" Thus, if deprivation of the pensionary benefits was by\n\"authority of law\" then nothing survives in this contention. We have\nalready examined in depth whether the Board has acted with the \"authority\nof law\" i.e. whether it has followed the prescribed procedure in bringing\nabout the changes in the pensionary benefits, and we have held accordingly.\nThus, this contention need not be examined any further.\n\nAs to Ms. Jaising's contention that the Board's actions violate \nArticle 14\n\nof the Constitution and the ratio in Nakara, we would have had to pursue\nthis contention only if we had not been able to decide the case on narrow\ninterpretational grounds as we have already done. Ms. Jaising, however,\ncontended that if we did not decide on the broader constitutional ground\nargued by her there would be multiplicity of litigation on the same issue.\nWe do not agree. In fact, at the present stage the argument of multiplicity\nof litigation is only speculative since we cannot predict what future\ncourse the Board or the employees will adopt. Further, even if multiple\nlitigations were a possibility that should not compel us to opine on every\nground argued before us, especially those involving constitutional issues.\nIn this context, we are reminded of a famous exchange in the U.S. Supreme\nCourt between Justice Frankfurter and the Counsel:4\n\n \"...Mr. Arnold pleaded with the Court that he would not like to win\n the case on the narrow procedural, statutory ground to which a\n majority of the members of the bench was evidently inclining.\n Responded Mr. Justice Frankfurter: \"The question is not whether you\n want to win the case on that ground or not. This Court reaches\n constitutional issues last, not first.\" He might well have quoted\n Mr. Justice Brandeis's famous assertion that the \"...most important\n thing we do is not doing.\"\"\n\nThis is precisely the principle, which we intend to adopt. This Court must\nbe parsimonious on the grounds on which it chooses to decide a particular\ncase. If a case can be decided upon any ground other than constitutional\ngrounds, such as by statutory construction or the like, this Court must do\nso. Despite the characteristic acuity with which Ms. Jaising argued the\nconstitutional grounds, in our opinion, they are not ripe for adjudication,\nas we have been able to decide the matter on other narrower grounds. Where\na paring knife suffices, a battle axe is precluded.\n\nThe Final Conclusions\n\nIn the result we hold as under:\n\n1. The change brought about in the qualifying service for full pension\nby increasing it from thirty years to thirty-three years by B.P.(Ch) No. 64\n(dated 31.3.03) is liable to be interfered with as it has been done without\namendment to the 1960 Regulations.\n\n2. The change brought about by B.P.(Ch) No. 64 (dated 31.3.03) linking\nthe pension to the average emoluments of the last ten months before\nretirement without amendment of the 1960 Regulations is bad in law.\n\n3. The reduction in the maximum permissible commutation of pension\nfrom 40% to 33 1/3% brought about by B.P.(Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.03.03),\nwithout amendment of the 1960 Regulations is not liable to be interfered\nwith.\n\n4. On the issue of whether the Board can adversely modify the pensions\npayable even after following the prescribed procedure (i.e. after amending\nthe applicable pension regulations) and whether such change would be\nviolative of \nArticle 14\n or the ratio in Nakara we express no opinion\nwhatsoever, as it is unnecessary in the light of our findings above.\n\nWe, therefore, partly allow the appeals and interfere with the impugned\njudgment of the High Court insofar as issues one and two are concerned and\nset aside the action of the Board on the aforesaid issues. This shall be\nwithout prejudice to the powers of the Board to bring about the changes\nafter proper amendment of the 1960 Regulations and also without prejudice\nto the rights of the employees to challenge such amendments on any\npermissible ground (including on the grounds we have chosen not to express\nour opinions upon).\n\nThe impugned High Court judgment, insofar as it upholds the reduction of\nthe maximum permissible commutation from 40% to 33 1/3% is not interfered\nwith without prejudice to the rights of the employees to raise an\nindustrial dispute.\n\nWe are informed that during the pendency of the writ petitions before the\nHigh Court there was a stay operating in favour of the employees as a\nresult of which service conditions that were under challenge were not\npermitted to be amended. There was also an interim stay of Board\nProceedings Nos. 64 and 66 (dated 31.3.03) granted by this Court on 8.3.04\nwhich has continued till today. In the circumstances, we extend the stay in\nrespect of Board Proceeding B.P.(Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.3.2003) for a period\nof eight weeks to enable the employees to raise an industrial dispute for\nadjudication, if so advised.\n\nThe appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms. No costs.",

These two aspects were the subject matters of the 1960\nRegulations and, therefore, by a Board Proceeding, without amending the\nRegulations, they could not have been modified to the prejudice of the\nemployees. B.P.(Ch) No. 64 (dated 31.3.03) is, therefore, bad in law and\nillegal inasmuch as it purports to bring about adverse changes in the\nquantification of pensions and the qualifying period of service for\npensions."

As have seen in the previous situations discussed, the latter\nis clearly impermissible. We, however, need to consider the former issue."

No. 74 (dated 19.3.03) issued by the\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu. As far as this change is concerned, it would\nappear that \nRegulation 7\n as framed in 1960 permitted a maximum commutation\nof one-third. By a Board Proceeding B.P.(Ch) No. 208 (dated 18.8.98), the\ncommutation percentage was increased to 40%. This has now been reduced to\n33 1/3% by another Board Proceeding B.P. (Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.3.03). In\nother words, what was granted by a Board Proceeding, without amending the\nRegulations, is sought to be taken away by another Board Proceeding with a\nview to following G.O.Ms. No. 74 (dated 19.3.03) issued by the State\nGovernment in respect of its own employees. As far as this change is\nconcerned, the argument of not following the proper procedure (i.e.\namending the Regulations) does not apply. In fact, the change made by\nB.P.(Ch) No. 66 (dated 31.3.03) actually brings the level of commutation to\nwhat was originally given by the 1960 Regulations. In our view, what was\ngranted by a mere Board Proceeding could be validly altered by another\nBoard Proceeding. Therefore, the challenge to the change in the commutation\npercentage brought about by B.P.(Ch) No. 66 fails by the same token."

She also submitted that, if this Court were to hold against the\nemployees on the point of commutation of pension, some time may be\npermitted to the employees to raise an industrial dispute with regard to\nthe change. Considering that the change is likely to have an impact on a\nlarge number of employees of the Board, we are inclined to give reasonable\ntime to the employees to raise an industrial dispute before the change\nimpacts them."
