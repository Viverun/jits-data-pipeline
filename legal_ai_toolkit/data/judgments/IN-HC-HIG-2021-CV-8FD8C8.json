It is the case of the petitioner that there is no arbitration clause\n\nunder the aforementioned memorandum of understanding dated 28.12.2017\n\nand despite the same, the second respondent has acted without authority as\n\nan Arbitrator to adjudicate disputes under the memorandum of\n\nunderstanding.

Mr.V.Raghavachari, learned counsel for the petitioner drew the\n\nattention of this Court to the following documents which have been filed in\n\nthe typed set of documents filed along with this civil revision petition\n\nnamely:\n\n(a) Memorandum of Understanding entered into between the\n\nPetitioner and the first respondent dated 28.12.2017;\n\n(b) Consent letter dated 08.08.2019 issued by the second respondent\n\ngiving his consent to act as an Arbitrator in respect of the disputes arising\n\nout of the memorandum of understanding;\n\n(c) Letter dated 20.08.2019 sent by the petitioner's counsel to the\n\nsecond respondent denying the existence of any arbitration clause under\n\nthe memorandum of understanding and requesting the second respondent\n\nto refrain from acting as an Arbitrator in respect of the alleged disputes\n\nunder the memorandum of understanding;\n\n(d) Email dated 05.02.2020 sent by the petitioner's counsel to the\n\n4/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nsecond respondent Arbitrator requesting him to pass orders in the\n\napplication filed by the petitioner under section 16 of the arbitration and\n\nconciliation act questioning his authority to act as an Arbitrator;\n\n(e) Order dated 07.02.2020 passed by the second respondent\n\nArbitrator under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act\n\nrejecting the application filed by the petitioner under the said provision.\n\n(f) Arbitral award dated 15.07.2021 passed by the second\n\nrespondent in the alleged dispute between the petitioner and the first\n\nrespondent under the memorandum of understanding dated 28.12.2017,\n\nwherein the petitioner was directed to pay the aforesaid sum mentioned in\n\nparagraph-2 supra.\n\n5. After referring to the aforementioned documents,\n\nMr.V.Raghavachari, learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that\n\nwithout the existence of any arbitration clause, the second respondent has\n\nacted as an Arbitrator and has conducted a Kangaroo Court and has\n\nbrought down his position as a lawyer to abject ridicule. Hence according\n\nto him, since the first respondent has circumvented the legal proceedings\n\n5/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nunder the guise of conducting arbitration and the second respondent having\n\npassed an illegal arbitral award against the petitioner, this civil revision\n\npetition under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India is maintainable.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner also drew the attention of this\n\nCourt to\nsection 7\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and would\n\nsubmit that since there is no arbitration clause under the memorandum of\n\nunderstanding which satisfies the requirement of\nsection 7\nof the Act, the\n\ninitiation of arbitral proceedings by the second respondent is void as there\n\nis no arbitration agreement. He would submit that despite the same, the\n\nsecond respondent has gone ahead and passed a collusive and fraudulent\n\narbitral award dated 15.07.2021 against the petitioner for a huge sum of\n\nRs.9,45,34,900/-.\n\n7. In support of his submission that a revision under\nArticle 227\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India is maintainable for the issue on hand, learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner drew the attention of this Court to the following\n\nauthorities:\n\n6/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n(a) A Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nSREI\n\nInfrastructure Finance Limited vs. Tuff Drilling Private Limited\n\nreported in (2018) 11 SCC 470;\n\n(b) A Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nPunjab State Power Corporation Limited vs. Emta Coal Limited and\n\nAnother\nreported in 2020 SCC Online SC 1165;\n\n(c) A single bench judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of\n\nSurender Kumar Singhal and Others vs. Arun Kumar Bhalotia and\n\nOthers\nreported in 2021 SCC Online Del 3708;\n\n(d) An unreported judgment dated 21.06.2021 of the Madras High\n\nCourt in the case of\nT.S.Gowrama and another vs. Nithin K.

Per contra Mr.P.H.Arvindh Pandian, learned Senior Counsel\n\n7/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nrepresenting Mr.D.Srinivasaraghavan, learned counsel for the first\n\nrespondent would submit that a civil revision petition under\nArticle 227\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India filed by the petitioner for the subject issue is not\n\nmaintainable. According to him, there being an alternate remedy and an\n\ninbuilt mechanism provided under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act with regard to the issues raised by the petitioner in this\n\ncivil revision petition, the present Civil revision under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution is not maintainable. According to him, the second respondent\n\nArbitrator having rejected the application filed by the petitioner under\n\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, wherein the petitioner\n\nhad questioned the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate the\n\ndispute, the only remedy for the petitioner is to challenge the final arbitral\n\naward passed against him in favour of the first respondent as per the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n9. Mr.Arvindh Pandian, learned Senior Counsel also drew the\n\nattention of this court to the arbitral award dated 15.07.2021 passed by the\n\nsecond respondent Arbitrator in favour of the first respondent and would\n\n8/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nsubmit that even without challenging the said arbitral award by filing an\n\napplication under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the\n\npetitioner has now approached this Court under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution of India which according to him is not maintainable. In\n\nsupport of his submissions, he drew the attention of this Court to the\n\nfollowing authorities namely:\n\n(a) A Division Bench Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nthe case of Deep Industries Limited vs. Oil and Natural Gas\n\nCorporation Limited and Another reported in (2020) 15 SCC 706; and\n\n(b) A Division Bench Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of\nBhaven Constructions vs. Executive Engineer, Sardar Sarovar\n\nNarmada Nigam Ltd.\n, and other reported in 2021 (1) CTC 450.\n\n10. Relying upon the aforesaid decisions, Mr.Arvind Pandian,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel for the first respondent would submit that in both\n\nthe aforesaid decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that when\n\nalternate statutory remedies are available under the\nArbitration and\n\nConciliation Act\n, to challenge the orders passed by the Arbitral Tribunal,\n\n9/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nthe inherent powers of the High Court under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution of India should not be exercised.\n\nDiscussion:\n\n11.\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 reads\n\nas follows:\n\n16. Competence of Arbitral Tribunal to rule on\nits jurisdiction.— (1) The Arbitral Tribunal may rule on\nits own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objections\nwith respect to the existence or validity of the\narbitration agreement, and for that purpose,—\n\n(a) an arbitration clause which forms part of a\ncontract shall be treated as an agreement independent\nof the other terms of the contract; and\n\n(b) a decision by the Arbitral Tribunal that the\ncontract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the\ninvalidity of the arbitration clause.\n\n(2) A plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have\njurisdiction shall be raised not later than the submission\nof the statement of defence; however, a party shall not\nbe precluded from raising such a plea merely because\n\n10/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nthat he has appointed, or participated in the\nappointment of, an Arbitrator.\n\n(3) A plea that the Arbitral Tribunal is exceeding\nthe scope of its authority shall be raised as soon as the\nmatter alleged to be beyond the scope of its authority is\nraised during the arbitral proceedings.\n\n(4) The Arbitral Tribunal may, in either of the\ncases referred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3),\nadmit a later plea if it considers the delay justified.\n\n(5) The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide on a plea\nreferred to in sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) and,\nwhere the Arbitral Tribunal takes a decision rejecting\nthe plea, continue with the arbitral proceedings and\nmake an arbitral award.\n\n(6) A party aggrieved by such an arbitral award\nmay make an application for setting aside such an\narbitral award in accordance with\nsection 34\n.\n\n12. By order dated 07.02.2019, the second respondent Arbitrator\n\nhas dismissed the application filed by the petitioner challenging the\n\njurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal on the ground that there exists an\n\narbitration agreement between the parties. Infact, as seen from the order\n\n11/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\ndated 07.02.2019, the second respondent Arbitrator took the objection of\n\nthe petitioner with regard to the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction on account\n\nof non-existence of arbitration clause and treated the same as an\n\napplication under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\nand by the aforesaid order, dismissed the said application. In the order\n\ndated 07.02.2019, the Arbitral Tribunal has also observed that the Tribunal\n\ninitiated settlement talks invoking\nsection 30\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 based on the mutual consent of the parties and their\n\ncounsel. The receipt of the order dated 07.02.2019 passed by the second\n\nrespondent Arbitrator under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 has also not been disputed by the petitioner as he himself has\n\nfiled the same in the typed set of documents filed along with this civil\n\nrevision petition under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n13. As seen from\nSection 16(5)\nof the Act, where the Arbitral\n\nTribunal takes the decision rejecting the plea questioning its jurisdiction to\n\ndecide the dispute, the arbitral proceedings shall continue and there is no\n\nprohibition for the Tribunal to pass an arbitral award.\n\n12/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n14.\nSection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is\n\nbased on the doctrine of kompetenz – kompetenz which indicates that an\n\nArbitral Tribunal is empowered and has the competence to rule on its own\n\njurisdiction, including determining all jurisdiction issues, and the existence\n\nor validity of an arbitration agreement. The underlying object of this\n\ndoctrine is to minimize judicial intervention in order to ensure that the\n\narbitral process is not thwarted at the very threshold, merely because a\n\npreliminary objection is raised by one of the parties.\n\n15.\nSection 37\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which\n\ndeals with appealable orders also does not permit any appeal rejecting an\n\napplication filed under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\nquestioning the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. The remedy for an\n\naggrieved party is only to challenge the arbitral award, in case it is passed\n\nagainst him or her in the near future, as seen from\nsection 16(6)\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n16. Under section 16(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n13/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n1996, it is made clear that a party aggrieved by the rejection of application\n\nfiled under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act questioning\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal can only challenge the award which\n\nmay be passed against him or her in the near future under\nsection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act. Subsequent to the passing of the order\n\ndated 07.02.2019 dismissing the application filed under\nsection 16\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, an Arbitral Award dated\n\n15.07.2021 has also been passed in favour of the first respondent against\n\nthe petitioner by the Arbitral Tribunal. Admittedly, till date, no application\n\nhas been filed by the petitioner under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act to challenge the said award. Under the Arbitral Award\n\ndated 15.07.2021, the Arbitral Tribunal has directed the petitioner to pay\n\nthe following amounts to the first respondent:\n\n(a) The amount of excess amount drawn by Respondent beyond his\n\nshare (41.8%) = Rs.2,39,40,980/-;\n\n(b) Interest calculation from 01.01.2013 to 30.09.2020 (2830 days)\n\nis Rs.4,45,49,860/-;\n\n14/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n(c) The amount of Rs.54 Lakh borrowed amount to redeem the\n\nRespondent Chettiyapatti Village Agricultural Land from Axis Bank =\n\nRs.54,00,000/-;\n\n(d) Interest calculation from 01.11.2010 to 30.09.2020 (3622 days)\n\nis Rs.1,28,58,100/-;\n\n(e) Interest calculation for the total claim amount of Rs.8,9,21,856/-\n\nfrom 01.10.2020 to 30.06.2021 at the rate of 12% (273 days) is\n\nRs.77,85,960/-;\n\n(f) No award on the additional prayed dated 05.03.2021 sought by\n\nthe Claimant;\n\n(g) Interest at the rate of 8% will be applicable post publishing the\n\naward till the award is subjected for realisation.\n\n17. Under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,\n\na party aggrieved by an arbitral award can challenge the same within three\n\nmonths from the date of receipt of a copy of the said arbitral award and\n\none month grace period thereafter is alone permissible that too with\n\nsufficient reasons which satisfies the competent court. In the case on hand,\n\n15/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nthe procedure prescribed under\nsection 16\nas well as under\nsection 34\nof\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has admittedly not been\n\nfollowed by the petitioner. But instead, he has circumvented the well\n\nestablished procedure by filing this revision under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution of India challenging the arbitral proceedings on the ground\n\nthat there is no arbitration clause. Infact, under\nsection 16(1)\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, the Arbitral Tribunal has got the power to\n\nrule on its own jurisdiction and adjudicate on the existence or non-\n\nexistence of an arbitration agreement, which in the instant case it has been\n\ndone by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n18.\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 defines\n\nan arbitration agreement which reads as follows:\n\n“7. Arbitration agreement.—(1) In this Part,\n“arbitration agreement” means an agreement by the\nparties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes\nwhich have arisen or which may arise between them in\nrespect of a defined legal relationship, whether\ncontractual or not.\n\n16/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n(2) An arbitration agreement may be in the form of\nan arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a\nseparate agreement.\n\n(3) An arbitration agreement shall be in writing.\n(4) An arbitration agreement is in writing if it is\ncontained in—\n\n(a) a document signed by the parties;\n\n(b) an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams\nor other means of telecommunication 1 [including\ncommunication through electronic means] which provide\na record of the agreement; or\n\n(c) an exchange of statements of claim and\ndefence in which the existence of the agreement is alleged\nby one party and not denied by the other.\n\n(5) The reference in a contract to a document\ncontaining an arbitration clause constitutes an\narbitration agreement if the contract is in writing and the\nreference is such as to make that arbitration clause part\nof the contract.”\n\nAs seen from\nSection 7\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, even\n\nthough the arbitration agreement should be in writing, various\n\ncircumstances have been given under the said section for the purpose of\n\ndeciding as to whether there is an arbitration agreement between the\n\n17/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nparties or not. Infact, as seen from the order dated 07.02.2019 passed by\n\nthe Arbitrator under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the\n\nsecond respondent Arbitrator has observed that the Arbitral Tribunal\n\ninitiated settlement talks invoking\nsection 30\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996, based on the mutual consent of the parties and\n\ntheir counsels. Therefore, there is a possibility that the petitioner may have\n\nacquiesced to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, even though there may not\n\nbe a separate arbitration clause under the memorandum of understanding\n\ndated 28.12.2017 between the parties. The acquiescence to the\n\njurisdiction Arbitral Tribunal will also enable the second respondent\n\nArbitrator to adjudicate the arbitral dispute between the parties. Rightly or\n\nwrongly, the second respondent Arbitrator may have passed the order\n\ndated 07.02.2019 under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 rejecting the petitioner's application questioning the Arbitral\n\nTribunal's jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the parties.\n\nAdmittedly, the petitioner has not disputed the contractual relationship\n\nbetween him and the first respondent, though he may dispute the existence\n\nof an arbitration clause under the memorandum of understanding dated\n\n18/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n28.12.2017 and his liability to pay.\n\n19. The Arbitral Award passed thereafter on 15.07.2021 in favour of\n\nthe first respondent against the petitioner has also not been challenged by\n\nthe petitioner under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act\n\nwhich is the settled and well established procedure contemplated under\n\nthe Act.\n\n20.\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nis a special\n\nenactment. The purpose of arbitration is to adjudicate the dispute between\n\nthe parties expeditiously. The scope for interference by courts is very\n\nminimal and is restricted only to the extent provided under the provisions\n\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\n21.\nSection 5\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 also\n\nmakes it clear that no judicial authority shall intervene except where so\n\nprovided in\nPart-I of the Act\n.\nSection 5\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, 1996 reads as follows:\n\n5. Extent of judicial intervention.—Notwithstanding\n\n19/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nanything contained in any other law for the time being in force,\nin matters governed by this Part, no judicial authority shall\nintervene except where so provided in this Part.\n\n22. In the case on hand, the procedure as contemplated under\n\nsection 16(6)\nas well as under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 is for the petitioner to challenge the arbitral award\n\ndated 15.07.2021 passed against him by raising all the grounds including\n\nthe ground raised by him in this civil revision petition namely questioning\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, due to the alleged non-existence of\n\narbitration clause. Instead of following the settled and well established\n\nprocedure, the petitioner has chosen to file this revision under\nArticle 227\n\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n23. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nShalini Shyam\n\nShetty & Another vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil\nreported in (2010) 8 SCC\n\n329 has discussed at length, the scope and ambit of supervisory\n\njurisdiction of the High Courts under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia and they are as follows:\n\n20/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n(a) A petition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution is different from\n\na petition under\nArticle 227.\nThe mode of exercise of power by High Court\n\nunder these two Articles is also different.\n\n(b) In any event, a petition under\nArticle 227\ncannot be called a writ\n\npetition. The history of the conferment of writ jurisdiction on High Courts\n\nis substantially different from the history of conferment of the power of\n\nSuperintendence on the High Courts under\nArticle 227.\n\n(c) High Courts cannot, on the drop of a hat, in exercise of its power\n\nof superintendence under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution, interfere with the\n\norders of tribunals or Courts inferior to it. Nor can it, in exercise of this\n\npower, act as a Court of appeal over the orders of Court or tribunal\n\nsubordinate to it. In cases where an alternative statutory mode of redressal\n\nhas been provided, that would also operate as a restraint on the exercise of\n\nthis power by the High Court.\n\n(d) The parameters of interference by High Courts in exercise of its\n\npower of superintendence have been repeatedly\nlaid down by\nthis Court.\nIn\n\nthis regard, the High Court must be guided by the principles\nlaid down by\n\nthe Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Waryam Singh\n\n21/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nand Another vs. Amarnath and another reported in 1954 AIR 215 and\n\nthe principles in Waryam Singh's case referred to supra have been\n\nrepeatedly followed by subsequent Constitution Benches and various other\n\ndecisions of this Court.\n\n(e) According to the ratio in Waryam Singh's case referred to supra,\n\nfollowed in subsequent cases, the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction\n\nof superintendence can interfere only in order to keep the tribunals and\n\nCourts subordinate to it, `within the bounds of their authority'.\n\n(f) In order to ensure that law is followed by such tribunals and\n\nCourts by exercising jurisdiction which is vested with them and by not\n\ndeclining to exercise the jurisdiction which is vested with them.\n\n(g) Apart from the situations pointed out in (e) and (f), High Court\n\ncan interfere in exercise of its power of superintendence, when there has\n\nbeen a patent perversity in the orders of tribunals and Courts subordinate\n\nto it or where there has been a gross and manifest failure of justice or the\n\nbasic principles of natural justice have been flouted.\n\n(h) In exercise of its power of superintendence, High Court cannot\n\ninterfere to correct mere errors of law or fact or just because another view\n\n22/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nthan the one taken by the tribunals or Courts subordinate to it, is a possible\n\nview. In other words the jurisdiction has to be very sparingly exercised.\n\n(i) High Court's power of superintendence under\nArticle 227\ncannot\n\nbe curtailed by any statute. It has been declared a part of the basic\n\nstructure of the Constitution by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nL.Chandra Kumar vs. Union of India &\n\nothers\n, reported in (1997) 3 SCC 261 and therefore abridgement by a\n\nConstitutional amendment is also very doubtful.\n\n(j) It may be true that a statutory amendment of a rather cognate\n\nprovision, like Section 115 of the Civil Procedure Code (by the\nCivil\n\nProcedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1999\n) does not and cannot cut down\n\nthe ambit of High Court's power under\nArticle 227.\nAt the same time, it\n\nmust be remembered that such statutory amendment does not\n\ncorrespondingly expand the High Court's jurisdiction of superintendence\n\nunder\nArticle 227.\n\n(k) The power is discretionary and has to be exercised on equitable\n\nprinciple. In an appropriate case, the power can be exercised suo motu.\n\n23/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n(l) On a proper appreciation of the wide and unfettered power of the\n\nHigh Court under\nArticle 227\n, it transpires that the main object of this\n\nArticle is to keep strict administrative and judicial control by the High\n\nCourt on the administration of justice within its territory.\n\n(m) The object of superintendence, both administrative and judicial,\n\nis to maintain efficiency, smooth and orderly functioning of the entire\n\nmachinery of justice in such a way as it does not bring it into any\n\ndisrepute. The power of interference under this Article is to be kept to the\n\nminimum to ensure that the wheel of justice does not come to a halt and\n\nthe fountain of justice remains pure and unpolluted in order to maintain\n\npublic confidence in the functioning of the tribunals and Courts\n\nsubordinate to High Court.\n\n(n) This reserve and exceptional power of judicial intervention is not\n\nto be exercised just for grant of relief in individual cases, but should be\n\ndirected for promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice\n\nin the larger public interest. Whereas\nArticle 226\nis meant for protection of\n\nindividual grievance. Therefore, the power under\nArticle 227\nmay be\n\n24/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nunfettered, but its exercise is subject to high degree of judicial discipline\n\npointed out above.\n\n(o) An improper and a frequent exercise of this power will be\n\ncounter-productive and will divest this extraordinary power of its strength\n\nand vitality.\n\n24. The instant case does not fall under any of the aforementioned\n\nparameters, wherein the power under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia can be exercised. When the Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing\n\nwith civil suits has time and again said that power under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution of India has to be sparingly exercised only in exceptional\n\ncases, the scope for interference under\nArticle 227\nin Arbitration matters\n\nhas to be naturally much more stringent as it is settled law that there should\n\nbe minimal interference by Courts in Arbitration matters. Admittedly, there\n\nis an alternate statutory remedy available to the petitioner namely by filing\n\nan application under\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 challenging the arbitral award dated 15.07.2021 raising the very\n\nsame grounds that have been raised in this civil revision petition filed\n\n25/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nunder\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India.\nThe Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996\nis a special enactment which enables the Courts to\n\nintervene only in the cases provided for under the said special statute. Only\n\nin rarest of rare cases, where on the face of it there is patent illegality on\n\nthe part of the Artbitral tribunal or there is no alternate statutory remedy,\n\nthe High court can exercise power under\nArticle 227\nof the constitution of\n\nIndia. The case on hand is not one such case which requires interference\n\nunder\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution.\n\n25.\nSection 5\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 also\n\nmakes it clear that no judicial authority shall intervene except where so\n\nprovided in\nPart-I of the Act\n. The petitioner has chosen a jurisdiction\n\nwhich has to be very sparingly exercised instead of availing the statutory\n\nremedy as provided under the special enactment namely the\nArbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\n26. The decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the\n\n26/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\npetitioner namely: (a) judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case\n\nof\nSREI Infrastructure Finance Limited vs. Tuff Drilling Private\n\nLimited\nreported in (2018) 11 SCC 470; (b) Judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nPunjab State Power Corporation Limited\n\nvs. Emta Coal Limited and Another\nreported in 2020 SCC Online SC\n\n1165; (c) A single bench judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of\n\nSurender Kumar Singhal and Others vs. Arun Kumar Bhalotia and\n\nOthers\nreported in 2021 SCC Online Del 3708; (d) An unreported\n\njudgment dated 21.06.2021 of the Madras High Court in the case of\n\nT.S.Gowrama and another vs. Nithin K. Chariyan\nin CRP.No.1603 of\n\n2019; & (e) An unreported judgment dated 27.02.2020 of the Madurai\n\nBench of the Madras High Court in the case of T.P.Kathiresan (died) and\n\nseven\nothers vs. R.Ramadass\n(died) and five others in\n\nCRP.(NPD)(MD).No.2275 of 2011 & CRP (PD) (MD).No.2368 of 2010\n\nare all cases wherein the High Court exercised power under\nArticle 227\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. However, exercise of such power depends on the\n\nfacts and circumstance of each case. Even as per the decisions relied upon\n\nby the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to supra, it is clear that\n\n27/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nthere will have to be exceptional circumstances for interference under\n\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India and the lack of jurisdiction of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal must be absolutely certain. In the case on hand, the lack\n\nof jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal is not absolutely certain as seen from\n\nthe order dated 7.2.2019 as well as the Arbitral Award dated 15.07.2021.\n\nTherefore, it can be tested only\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act and not otherwise.\n\n27. As\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nShalini Shyam\n\nShetty & Another vs. Rajendra Shankar Patil\nreported in (2010) 8 SCC\n\n329, the High Courts cannot, on the drop of the hat, exercise its power\n\nunder\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India in cases where an alternate\n\nstatutory mode of redressal is provided.\n\n28. In the case on hand, the petitioner has appeared before the\n\nsecond respondent Arbitrator and has also filled a written objection\n\nquestioning his jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the parties which\n\nhas also been rejected by the Arbitrator in his order dated 07.02.2019 and\n\n28/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nthereafter the Arbitrator has also passed the arbitral award against the\n\npetitioner on 15.07.2021. The petitioner has also not challenged till date\n\nthe said arbitral award dated 15.07.2021 under\nsection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Therefore, this Court is of the\n\nconsidered view that this is not a fit case for interference under\nArticle 227\n\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n29.\nIn the case of\nDeep Industries Limited vs. Oil and Natural\n\nGas Corporation Limited and Another\nreported in (2020) 15 SCC 706;\n\nand (b) In the case of\nBhaven Constructions vs. Executive Engineer,\n\nSardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd.\n, and other reported in 2021 (1)\n\nCTC 450, referred to supra , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that\n\nwhen an application under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct, challenging the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal has been\n\ndismissed by the Arbitral Tribunal, the only remedy for the aggrieved\n\nparty is to challenge the Arbitral award as and when passed under\nsection\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n29/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n30. The relevant paragraph of\nDeep Industries Limited\ncase\n\nreferred to supra are as follows:\n\n22. One other feature of this case is of some importance. As\n\nstated hereinabove, on 09.05.2018, a\nsection 16\napplication had\n\nbeen dismissed by the learned Arbitrator in which substantially the\n\nsame contention which found favour with the High Court was taken\n\nup. The drill of\nSection 16\nof the Act is that where a\nSection 16\n\napplication is dismissed, no appeal is provided and the challenge\n\nto the\nSection 16\napplication being dismissed must await the\n\npassing of a final award at which stage it may be raised under\n\nSection 34\n. What the High Court has done in the present case is to\n\ninvert this statutory scheme by going into exactly the same matter\n\nas was gone into by the Arbitrator in the\nSection 16\napplication,\n\nand then decided that the two year ban was no part of the notice\n\nfor arbitration issued on 02.11.2017, a finding which is directly\n\ncontrary to the finding of the learned Arbitrator dismissing the\n\nSection 16\napplication. For this reason alone, the judgment under\n\nappeal needs to be set aside. Even otherwise, as has been correctly\n\n30/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\npointed out by Mr. Rohatgi, the judgment under appeal goes into\n\nthe merits of the case and states that the action of putting the\n\nContractor and his Directors “on holiday” is not a consequence of\n\nthe termination of the agreement. This is wholly incorrect as it is\n\nonly because of the termination that the show cause notice dated\n\n18.10.2017 proposing to impose a two year ban/blacklisting was\n\nsent. Even otherwise, entering into the general thicket of disputes\n\nbetween the parties does not behove a court exercising jurisdiction\n\nunder\nArticle 227\n, where only jurisdictional errors can be\n\ncorrected. Therefore to state that the ban order was passed under\n\na General Contract Manual and not Clause 18 of the Agreement,\n\nbesides being incorrect, would also be incorrect for the reason that\n\nthe General Contract Manual does not mean that such order was\n\nissued as an administrative order invoking the executive power, but\n\nwas only as an order which emanated from the contract itself.\n\nFurther to state that “serious disputes” as to jurisdiction seem to\n\nhave cropped up is not the same thing as saying that the Arbitral\n\nTribunal lacked inherent jurisdiction in going into and deciding the\n\n31/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nSection 17\napplication. In point of fact, the Arbitral Tribunal was\n\nwell within its jurisdiction in referring to the contract and the ban\n\norder and then applying the law and finally issuing the stay order.\n\nEven if it be accepted that the principle\nlaid down by\n\nSection 41(e)\n\nof the Specific Relief Act was infracted, in that damages could have\n\nbeen granted, as a result of which an injunction ought not to have\n\nbeen issued, is a mere error of law and not an error of jurisdiction,\n\nmuch less an error of inherent jurisdiction going to the root of the\n\nmatter. Therefore, even otherwise, the High Court judgment cannot\n\nbe sustained and is set aside.\n\n31.\nIn the aforesaid decision also, the Hon'ble Supreme Court after\n\ntaking note of the observations made in the decision relied upon by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner in\nPunjab State Power Corporation\n\nLimited\n's case referred to supra where the power under\nArticle 227\nof the\n\nConstitution of India was exercised by the High Court in respect of orders\n\npassed under\nsection 11\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\ndistinguished\nthe said decision\nby holding that the observations were made\n\n32/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nin\nPunjab State Power Corporation Limited\n's case referred to supra for\n\nthe reason that no provision for appeal had been given by the statute\n\nagainst the orders passed under\nsection 11\nof the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, which is why the High Court's supervisory jurisdiction\n\nshould first be invoked before going to the Supreme Court under Article\n\n136.\nIn\nDeep Industries Limited\n's case referred to supra, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has made it clear that the facts involved\nin that case\nis\n\ndistinguishable for the reason that in\nPunjab State Power Corporation\n\nLimited\ncase ,\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India was exercised by the\n\nHigh Court only after the first appeal was dismissed under\nSection 37\nof\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The relevant portion of\nthe said\n\njudgment\nis extracted hereunder:\n\n“What is important to note is that the observations of this\n\nCourt in this judgment were for the reason that no provision for\n\nappeal had been given by statute against the orders passed under\n\nSection 11\n, which is why the High Court’s supervisory\n\njurisdiction should first be invoked before coming to this Court\n\nunder\nArticle 136.\nGiven the facts of the present case, this case\n\n33/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nis equally distinguishable for the reason that in this case the 227\n\njurisdiction has been exercised by the High Court only after a\n\nfirst appeal was dismissed under\nSection 37\nof the Act.\n\n32.\nIn\nBhaven Constructions vs. Executive Engineer, Sardar\n\nSarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd.\n, and other reported in 2021 (1) CTC 450,\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court following the decision rendered in\nDeep\n\nIndustries Limited\n's case referred to supra has also held that when there is\n\na mechanism provided for challenging the arbitral award under\nsection 34\n\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, no exceptional circumstance has\n\nbeen established to invoke remedy under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia for the alleged unilateral appointment of Arbitrator. The relevant\n\nparagraph of the aforesaid judgment reads as follows:\n\n“25. It must be noted that\nSection 16\nof the\nArbitration Act, necessarily mandates that the issue of\njurisdiction must be dealt first by the tribunal, before the\nCourt examines the same under\nSection 34\n. Respondent No.\n1 is therefore not left remediless, and has statutorily been\nprovided a chance of appeal.\nIn\nDeep Industries\ncase\n(supra), this Court observed as follows:\n\n34/38\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\n“22. One other feature of this case is of\nsome importance. As stated herein above, on\n09.05.2018, a\nSection 16\napplication had been\ndismissed by the learned Arbitrator in which\nsubstantially the same contention which found\nfavour with the High Court was taken up. The\ndrill of\nSection 16\nof the Act is that where a\n\nSection 16\napplication is dismissed, no appeal is\nprovided and the challenge to the\nSection 16\n\napplication being dismissed must await the\npassing of a final award at which stage it may be\nraised under\nSection 34\n.”\n\n26. In view of the above reasoning, we are of the\nconsidered opinion that the High Court erred in utilizing its\ndiscretionary power available under\nArticles 226\nand\nof\nthe Constitution herein. Thus, the appeal is allowed and the\nimpugned Order of the High Court is set aside. There shall\nbe no order as to costs. Before we part, we make it clear\nthat Respondent No. 1 herein is at liberty to raise any\nlegally permissible objections regarding the jurisdictional\nquestion in the pending\nSection 34\nproceedings.”\n\n33.\nIn the aforementioned case also, an interpretation of\nsection 16\n/\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\nCRP(NPD).No.1441 of 2021 &\n\nCMP.No.11291 of 2021\n\nof the\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nwas involved and\nin that case\n\nalso, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has categorically held that challenge to\n\nan order dismissing the application filed under\nsection 16\nof the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, 1996 questioning the jurisdiction of the Arbitral\n\nTribunal can be raised only in an application under\nsection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act and exercising the extraordinary power of\n\nthe High Court under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India is not\n\npermissible.\n\n34. For the foregoing reasons, this court is of the considered view\n\nthat there is no merit in this civil revision petition filed under\nArticle 227\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. Accordingly, this Civil Revision Petition is\n\ndismissed. No costs. Consequently connected miscellaneous petition is\n\nclosed.\n\n13.09.2021\n\nNote: Learned counsel for the petitioner after pronouncing of this order\nseeks for return of the original arbitral award from the Registry, since the\npetitioner intends to challenge the arbitral award by filing an application\nunder\nsection 34\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.
