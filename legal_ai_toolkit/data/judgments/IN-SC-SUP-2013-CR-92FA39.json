K. PATNAIK, J.\n\nThis is an appeal by way of special leave under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution against the judgment dated 16.09.2004 of the Punjab and\nHaryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No.337-SB of 1992.\n\nFacts:\n\n2. The facts very briefly are that on 26.02.1991 at 11.20 P.M., the\nAssistant Sub-Inspector of Police of Police Station-City Dabwali,\nDistrict Sirsa in Haryana, Madan Lal recorded a statement of\nVandana at CHC Hospital, Mandi Dabwali. She stated that about two\nyears ago, she was married to the appellant and the appellant used\nto taunt her on petty matters and earlier the appellant used to\ntease her for dowry and on being fed up with the habits of the\nappellant, on 26.02.1991 between 7.00 and 7.30 P.M., she sprinkled\nkerosene on her and set herself on fire. The statement of Vandana\nwas registered as First Information Report (FIR) by the S.I. of\nP.S. Dabwali, Kuldeep Singh. Soon thereafter on 26.02.1991, the\nJudicial Magistrate, First Class, R.S. Bagri, recorded a statement\nof Vandana under\nSection 164\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973 (for short ‘\nCr.P.C\n.’) in which Vandana reiterated her\nstatement to the Police. On 27.02.1991 at 2.20 A.M., Vandana died.\n\nPost mortem was carried out on the body of Vandana (hereinafter\nreferred to as ‘the deceased’) by Dr. S.S. Bansal. The Police then\ntook up the investigation and submitted a charge-sheet against the\nappellant.\n\n3. On 28.08.1991, the Sessions Court framed a charge under\nSection\n304B\n, IPC, against the appellant to which the appellant pleaded not\nguilty. At the trial, the prosecution examined Kedar Nath, who had\nprepared the scaled plan (Ext. PA) on the place of occurrence, as\nPW-1; Dr. R.C. Chaudhary, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Mandi\nDabwali, who had examined the deceased and found the burn injuries\non her body as PW-2; S.I. Kuldeep Singh of P.S. Dabwali, who had\nregistered the FIR as PW-3; the landlord of the house in which the\ndeceased lived with her husband as PW-4; Niranjan Ram Gupta, the\nfather of the deceased, as PW-5; Bhupinder Kumar, the uncle of the\ndeceased as PW-6; Dr. S.S. Bansal, who conducted the post mortem on\nthe body of the deceased as PW-7; R.S. Bagri, the Judicial\nMagistrate, who recorded the statement of the deceased under\n\nSection 164\n, Cr.P.C. as PW-8 and ASI Madan Lal, the Investigating\nOfficer, as PW-9. The statement of the appellant was recorded\nunder\nSection 313\n, Cr.P.C. In defence, the appellant examined\nRamesh Devra as DW-1; Jagdish Kumar as DW-2; Nihal Singh, Assistant\nChief Medical Officer, Sirsa, as DW-3; Dr. Ajay Kumar Gupta,\nMedical Officer, Civil Hospital, Sirsa, as DW-4 and Dr. J.L.\nBhutani as DW-5. After considering the evidence and the arguments\non behalf of the parties, the learned Additional Sessions Judge,\nSirsa, in his judgment dated 31.08.1992 held that the prosecution\nhas been able to prove the charge against the appellant and\naccordingly convicted him under\nSection 304B\n, IPC. Thereafter, the\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge heard the accused on the quantum\nof sentence and ordered that the appellant be sentenced to seven\nyears R.I. with a fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default of payment of\nfine, to undergo further imprisonment of six months.\n\n4. Aggrieved, the appellant filed Criminal Appeal No.337-SB of 1992\nbefore the High Court. After hearing the appeal, the High Court in\nthe impugned judgment held that the deceased had indicated in her\ndying declarations (Exts.PG and PN) before ASI Madan Lal and the\nJudicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri that she was being harassed by her\nhusband with demands of dowry on account of which she had sprinkled\nkerosene on herself before setting herself ablaze. The High Court\nfurther held that the statement of the deceased in these two dying\ndeclarations (Exts. PG and PN) that she was being harassed for\ndowry stood corroborated by the evidence of the father of the\ndeceased (PW-5) and uncle of the deceased (PW-6). The High Court\nrejected the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the\ndeceased was not in the medical condition to speak inasmuch as her\nlarynx and tracheae had been charred by burns, relying on the\ntestimony of the medical experts Dr. R.C. Chaudhary (PW-2) and Dr.\nJ.L. Bhutani (DW-5) as well as the testimony of the ASI Madan Lal\n(PW-9) and the Judicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri (PW-8), who had\nrecorded the dying declarations of the deceased. The High Court\naccordingly held that there was no ground to interfere with the\norders of conviction and sentence passed by the trial court and\ndismissed the criminal appeal of the appellant.\n\nContentions of the learned counsel for the parties:\n\n5. Mr. S.B. Upadhyay, learned counsel for the appellant, submitted\nthat the finding in the impugned judgment that the appellant was\nharassing the deceased for dowry is not correct inasmuch as PW-4,\nthe landlord of the house in which the deceased and her husband\nwere living, has stated in his evidence that he did not hear any\nsort of disharmony or fighting between the appellant and the\ndeceased and that they used to live and lead a normal married life\nand both of them were blessed with a daughter, who was aged about\nsix to seven months. He further submitted that when the Judicial\nMagistrate (PW-8) recorded the statement of the deceased under\n\nSection 164\n, Cr.P.C., Dr. R.C. Chaudhary (PW-2) was not present, as\nwill be evident from the evidence of PW-8. He submitted that PW-2,\non the other hand, was the doctor who issued the fitness\ncertificate to the Judicial Magistrate that the deceased was in a\nfit state to give the statement. He referred to the opinion of Dr.\nS.S. Bansal (PW-7) to submit that the larynx and tracheae is a\nvoice box containing vocal cords through which a man speaks and if\nthey were charred by heat and burns, a person will not be able to\nspeak. He submitted that DW-2 was present in the hospital for the\nwhole night on 26.02.1991 and DW-2 has stated that the deceased was\nnot in a position to speak when the alleged dying declarations are\nsaid to have been made. He submitted that the trial court and the\nHigh Court, therefore, were not correct in relying on the dying\ndeclarations of the deceased recorded by the ASI Madan Lal and the\nJudicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri for holding the appellant guilty.\n\n6. Mr. Upadhyay next submitted that on a reading of the entire\nevidence of PW-5 (the father of the deceased), it will be clear\nthat the appellant and the deceased were happy with each other and\nthis will also be evident from the letters exchanged between the\nfamily members between March 1989 and January 1991 (Exts. DE/2,\nDE/6, DE/7, DE/9, DE/12, DE/15, DE/17, DE/18, DE/19, DE/20, DE/21,\nDE/22 and DE/23). He submitted that this is, therefore, not a case\nwhere the appellant had made any demand of dowry on the deceased\nand had subjected the deceased to any cruelty or harassment in\nconnection with the demand of dowry soon before her death and hence\nthe ingredients of the offence under\nSection 304B\n, IPC, are missing\nin this case and, therefore, the appellant could not have been held\nguilty under\nSection 304B\n, IPC.\n\n7. Mr. Upadhyay cited the decisions of this Court in\nSanjiv Kumar v.\nState of Punjab\n[(2009) 16 SCC 487], Durga Prasad & Anr. v. State\nof Madhya Pradesh [(2010) 9 SCC 73], Gurdeep Singh v. State of\nPunjab & Ors. [(2011) 12 SCC 408] and Devinder alias\nKala Ram &\nOrs. v. State of Haryana\n[2012) 10 SCC 763] in support of his\nsubmission that the offence under\nSection 304B\n, IPC, is not made\nout against the appellant. He submitted that at the worst the\nappellant can be held guilty under\nSection 306\n, IPC, for having\nabetted suicide by the deceased if the dying declaration is to be\naccepted. He argued that the appellant has already undergone two\nyears imprisonment and is now on bail and also has a young daughter\nto take care of and, therefore, the appellant should not be\nsubjected to further imprisonment for the offence under\nSection\n, IPC.\n\n8. Mr. Vikas Sharma, learned counsel appearing for the State of\nHaryana, on the other hand, submitted that the two dying\ndeclarations (Ext. PG and PN) of the deceased are clear that the\nappellant used to harass the deceased for dowry and being fed up\nwith the habits of the appellant, the deceased sprinkled kerosene\noil on herself and set herself ablaze. He submitted that the\nevidence of Dr. S.S. Bansal (PW-7) is clear that one can speak when\nthe larynx and tracheae are in the process of being charred. He\nsubmitted that even DW-5, the medical expert produced by the\naccused in his defence, has admitted in cross-examination that in\ncase of charring of vocal chords, the patient may be able to speak\nand the trial court has relied on this admission made by DW-5. He\nsubmitted that Dr. R.C. Chaudhary has also deposed that the\ndeceased was fit to make the statement. He submitted that both\nthese witnesses were medical experts and were rightly relied on by\nthe trial court and the High Court to reject the contention of the\nappellant that the deceased was not in a fit condition to give the\nstatements to ASI Madan Lal and the Judicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri.\nMr. Sharma also relied on the evidence of PW-5 that the appellant\nused to give beatings to the deceased and demand more and more\ndowry. He submitted that the trial court and the High Court were\ntherefore right in holding the appellant guilty of the offence\nunder\nSection 304B\nIPC.\n\n9. Mr. Sharma cited the decision of this Court in\nBansi Lal v. State\nof Haryana\n[(2011) 11 SCC 359] in which it has been held that while\nconsidering a case under\nSection 304B\n, IPC, cruelty in connection\nwith demand of dowry has to be proved in close proximity to the\ntime of death because of the expression “soon before her death” in\n\nSection 304B\nIPC, and the Court has to analyse the facts and\ncircumstances of each case leading to the death of the victim and\ndecide if there is such proximate connection between the act of\ncruelty in connection with demand of dowry and death of the woman.\n\nHe also cited the decision of this Court in\nSmt. Shanti and Another\nv. State of Haryana\n[AIR 1991 SC 1226] for the proposition that\nonce the death of a woman is found to be unnatural, either\nhomicidal or suicidal,\nSection 304B\n, IPC, has to be attracted.\n\nFindings of the Court:\n\n10. The first question that we have to decide is whether the deceased\nwas in a condition to make the dying declarations (Exts.PG and PN)\nbefore ASI Madan Lal and the Judicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri when\nher larynx and tracheae had been affected by burns. PW-2, Dr. R.C.\nChaudhary, has stated in his evidence that on 26.02.1991, on the\napplication of the Police (Ext.PD), he gave his opinion in Ext.PD/1\nto the effect that the patient was fit to give her statement and\nthis opinion was given at 10.30 P.M. PW-9, ASI Madan Lal, has\ndeposed in his evidence that the doctor vide his endorsement\n(Ext.PD/1) declared that Vandana was fit to give her statement and\nthen he recorded the statement of Vandana (Ext.PG) correctly and\nafter Vandana admitted the contents of the statement to be correct,\nshe gave her thumb impression in Ext.PG in token of its\ncorrectness. PW-9 has further stated that at that time Vandana was\nliving and taking long sigh and she remained conscious at the time\nof giving her statement (Ext. PG). PW-9 has also stated that he\nthen went to the Judicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri (PW-8) whose\nresidence was near the hospital and R.S.Bagri accompanied him to\nthe hospital and recorded the statement of Vandana. The Judicial\nMagistrate R.S. Bagri has accordingly deposed that ASI Madan Lal\nhad approached him in person at his residence at 10.40 P.M. along\nwith application (Ext.PM) and he came to the hospital and moved an\napplication (Ext.PM/1) to the Medical Officer concerned and\nthereafter he recorded her statement and at the time of recording\nthe statement, Dr. R.C. Chaudhary was not present but he had given\na certificate (Ext.PM/2) on the application (Ext.PM/1) that Vandana\nwas in a fit state to make a statement and she continued to be so\nduring the making of the statement. It is thus clear from the\nevidence of the aforesaid three witnesses PW-2, PW-8 and PW-9 that\nat the time the statements of Vandana were recorded by ASI Madan\nLal (PW-9) and the Judicial Magistrate R.S. Bagri (PW-8), she was\nin a fit condition to make the statement. When, however, the post\nmortem was carried out on 27.02.1991 by Dr.S.S. Bansal (PW-7) at\n4.00 P.M. he found that the larynx and tracheae of the deceased\nwere charred by heat. On questions being put to him whether a\nperson will be able to speak when her larynx and tracheae were\ncharred by heat, PW-7 has clarified that when the larynx and\ntracheae are charred, the person cannot speak, but when the larynx\nand tracheae are in the process of being charred, the person can\nspeak. Dr. J.L. Bhutani, DW-5, has given his opinion that if the\nvocal chord of larynx is charred, such person may be able to speak,\nbut not clearly, and it will be difficult to understand. The\nopinions of the two medical experts, therefore, are not in variance\nof the ocular evidence of PW-2, PW-8 and PW-9 that Vandana was in a\nposition to speak when her dying declarations were recorded on the\nnight of 26.02.1991. Hence, the two dying declarations (Ext.PG and\nExt.PN) can be relied on by the Court.\n\n11. The next question which we have to decide is whether the\nprosecution has been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the\nappellant has committed the offence of dowry death under\nSection\n304B\n, IPC. The two dying declarations are similarly worded. We,\ntherefore, extract hereinbelow only the dying declaration which was\nrecorded by the Judicial Magistrate (Ext. PN):\n\n“Statement of Vandana, w/o Rajiv Singla, age 23 years, occupation\nhouse wife, R/o Dabwali, u/s 164 Cr.P.C.\n\nI was married to Dr. Rajiv Singla 2 years back. My husband\nused to get upset on petty issues. My in-laws lived separately.\nThey are living after the 6 months of my marriage. My daughter is\nof 2 months. Today about 7.30 p.m., in evening I was fed up with\nactivities of my husband and put on kerosene oil and burn myself.\nEarlier my husband used to taunt me for dowry. Action should be\ntaken against my husband.\n\nSd/- R.C. Bangri\nRO & AC JMIC\nDabwali, 26-2-91\nRTI of Vandana\nIdentified\nSd/-\nMadan Lal, ASI\nP.C. City Dabwali,\nDated: 26-2-91”\n\nIt will be clear from the contents of the dying declaration (Ext. PN) that\nthe deceased was fed up with the activities of her husband and she poured\nkerosene oil on herself and burnt herself. What those activities of the\nappellant were which prompted her to commit suicide have not been clearly\nstated, but she has stated that her husband used to get upset on petty\nissues and earlier her husband used to taunt her for dowry.\n\n12. When, however, we scrutinize the evidence of PW-5, the father of the\ndeceased, we find that soon before the death of the deceased, the appellant\nhad subjected the deceased to cruelty which was not in any way connected\nwith the demand of dowry. The relevant part of the evidence of PW-5 is\nquoted hereinbelow:\n\n“Smt. Vandhana deceased was my daughter. I had married my daughter\nVandhana with Rajiv Kumar, accused now present in the Court on\n28.01.1989 at Kartarpur. Out of her wed lock with the accused Rajiv\nKumar, a female child was born on 2.7.90. Vandhana deceased and\nRajiv Kumar accused, her husband used to reside/live in Mandi\nDabwali. After marriage, whenever Vandhana used to come to tell us,\nshe used to tell me that her husband Rajiv Kumar gives her beating\nand demands more and more dowry. We used to fulfill the demand of\nRajiv Kumar accused in the shape of dowry put forward before us by\nmy daughter and used to send her back after advising her that she is\nto live with her husband and should try to adjust with him. On\n19.2.91 Vandhana came to me at Kartarpur and told me that two days\nprior to 19.2.91, Rajiv Kumar accused her husband gave her merciless\nbeating. She narrated this to me in the presence of my wife Smt.\nPushpa Rani and Bhupinder Singh my brother in fact, he is my friend.\n\nOn the night of 24.2.91, I had received anonymous telephone call on\nthe telephone no. 242 that Rajiv Kumar has fled away leaving his\nminor daughter alone. On hearing this, my daughter Vandhana got\nperturbed and wanted us to leave her at Mandi Dabwali immediately.\nOn 25.02.91 (25.2.91) we left Vandhana at Mandi Dabwali. I was\naccompanied by my wife Pushpa Rani and Bhupinder Kumar. On reaching\nat Dabwali we found Rajiv Kumar present in his clinic and later on\nhe came to the house. We told Rajiv Kumar that he should not\nrepeatedly give beating to Vandhana. We told him that it was not\nproper for him to do so. We also advised our daughter Vandhana to\nadjust with her husband and to remain calm and quiet and not to\nspeak. On 25.2.91 itself after advising Rajiv Kumar and Vandhana we\ncame back to Kartarpur after staying at night at Bhatinda. On\n27.2.91, I received a telephonic message that Vandhana after\nsprinkling kerosene oil on her body has put herself fire and that\nshe is dead and no longer alive.”\n\nFrom the aforesaid evidence of PW-5, it is clear that the marriage between\nthe appellant and the deceased took place on 28.01.1989 and the demand of\ndowry by the appellant and the beatings for more dowry was after the\nmarriage. PW-5 has also stated that on 19.02.1991 the deceased came to him\nat Kartarpur and told him that two days prior to 19.02.1991, the appellant\ngave her merciless beating. PW-5 has, however, not stated that the beating\nthat the appellant gave to the deceased on 19.02.1991 was in connection\nwith demand of dowry. One of the essential ingredients of the offence of\ndowry death under\nSection 304B\n, IPC is that the accused must have subjected\na woman to cruelty in connection with demand of dowry soon before her death\nand this ingredient has to be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable\ndoubt and only then the Court will presume that the accused has committed\nthe offence of dowry death under\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act.\nAs this ingredient of\nSection 304B\n, IPC, has not been established by the\nprosecution, the trial court and the High Court were not correct in holding\nthe appellant guilty of the offence of dowry death under\nSection 304B\n, IPC.\n\n13. We have perused the decision of this Court in\nSmt. Shanti and\nAnother v. State of Haryana\n(supra) cited by Mr. Sharma and we find\nthat in the aforesaid case the facts were that Smt. Shanti was mother-\nin-law of the deceased and Smt. Krishna was another inmate in the\nmatrimonial home in which the deceased was living and it was alleged\nthat both Smt. Shanti and Smt. Krishna were harassing the deceased\nall the while after the marriage for not bringing a scooter and\ntelevision as part of the dowry and she was treated cruelly. On\n26.04.1988 at about 11.00 P.M., the father of the deceased came to\nknow that the deceased had been murdered and was cremated by two\nladies and he filed a report accordingly before the police. Both the\ncourts below held that the two ladies did not send the deceased to\nher parents house and drove out the brother and father of the\ndeceased complaining that a scooter and a television has not been\ngiven as dowry. The evidence of the father, mother and brother of\nthe deceased was that they were not even informed soon after the\ndeath of the deceased and the appellants had hurriedly cremated the\ndead body. In these circumstances, this Court held that the\npresumption under\nSection 113-B\nof the Indian Evidence Act that the\ntwo ladies have committed the offence under\nSection 304B\n, IPC, was\nattracted. This was, therefore, a case where the evidence clearly\ndisclosed that the deceased had been subjected to harassment or\ncruelty committed by the appellants soon before her death.\n\n14. We have also examined the decision of this Court in\nBansi Lal v.\nState of Haryana\n(supra), cited by Mr. Sharma, and we find that the\nfacts\nin that case\nwere that the appellant Bansi Lal was married to\nSarla on 04.04.1988. She was subjected to cruelty, harassment and\ndemand of dowry and on 25.06.1991 she died. After investigation of\nthe case, prosecution filed a charge-sheet against Bansi Lal and his\nmother Smt. Shanti Devi and charges were framed against them under\n\nSections 498A\n,\n304B\nand\n, IPC, and they were convicted for the\nsaid charges by the trial court. The High Court, however, acquitted\nSmt. Shanti Devi, but convicted Bansi Lal because of demand of dowry\nand cruelty in connection with demand of dowry to which the deceased\nwas subjected to by him. Bansi Lal had made a statement under\n\nSection 313\n, Cr.P.C. that Sarla was in love with some other person\nbut she was forced to marry Bansi Lal against her will due to which\nshe felt suffocated and committed suicide, leaving a suicide note to\nthat effect. On these facts, this Court held that once it is shown\nthat soon before her death the deceased has been subjected to cruelty\nor harassment for or in connection with the demand for dowry, the\nCourt shall presume that such person has caused the dowry death under\n\nSection 113-B\nof the Evidence Act, and if the case of the Bansi Lal\nwas that Sarla has committed suicide, the onus was on him to\nestablish his defence by leading sufficient evidence to rebut the\npresumption that he has not caused the dowry death, but Bansi Lal has\nfailed to discharge that onus.\n\n15. On the evidence on record, though the appellant is not guilty of\nthe offence under\nSection 304B\n, IPC, he is certainly guilty of offences of\nabetment of suicide and cruelty.\nSection 113-A\nof the Indian Evidence Act\nstates as follows:\n\n“113A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide by a married woman.-\nWhen the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman\nhad been abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and\nit is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven\nyears from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such\nrelative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the court may\npresume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case,\nthat such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such\nrelative of her husband.\n\nExplanation.--For the purposes of this section, \"cruelty\" shall have\nthe same meaning as in\nsection 498A\nof the Indian Penal Code”\n\nThe language of\nSection 113-A\nof the Indian Evidence Act makes it clear\nthat if a woman has committed suicide within a period of seven years from\nthe date of her marriage and that her husband had subjected her to cruelty,\nthe court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the\ncase, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband. The Explanation\nto\nSection 113-A\nof the Indian Evidence Act states that for the purpose of\nSection 113-A “cruelty” shall have the same meaning as in\nSection 498A\n,\nIPC. The Explanation to\nSection 498A\n, IPC, defines ‘cruelty’ and Clause\n\n(a) of the Explanation states that cruelty means any willful conduct which\nis of such nature as likely to drive a woman to commit suicide. The dying\ndeclaration of the deceased (Ext. PN) as well as the evidence of PW-5\nextracted above are sufficient to establish that the appellant used to\nfight on petty issues and give beatings to the deceased, which drove the\ndeceased to commit suicide. This is, therefore, a clear case where the\nappellant had committed offences under\nSections 498A\nand\n, IPC.\n\n16. In K. Prema S. Rao and Another, etc. v. Yadla Srinivasa Rao and\nOthers, etc. [(2003) 1 SCC 217], this Court on similar facts has held that\nto attract the provisions of\nSection 304B\n, IPC, one of the main ingredients\nof the offence, which is required to be established, is that “soon before\nher death” she was subjected to cruelty and harassment “in connection with\nthe demand for dowry” and this ingredient of the offence was not there\nin\nthat case\n. This Court, however, held that it was not necessary to remit the\nmatter to the trial court for framing a charge under\nSection 306\n, IPC, and\nthe accused also cannot complain for want of opportunity to defend the\ncharge under\nSection 306\n, IPC, if the facts found in evidence justify the\nconviction of the appellant under\nSections 498A\nand\n, IPC instead of the\ngraver offence under\nSection 304B\n, IPC. In that case, the three-Judge\nBench of this Court held the appellant guilty of the offences under\n\nSections 498A\nand\n, IPC instead of the graver offence under\nSection\n304B\n, IPC.\n\n17. In this case also, we hold the appellant guilty of offences under\n\nSections 498A\nand\n, IPC. Considering the particular conduct of\nthe appellant which drove the deceased to commit suicide, we impose a\nsentence of one year imprisonment and fine of Rs.1,000/- for the\noffence under\nSection 498A\n, IPC and impose a sentence of three years\nimprisonment and fine of Rs.2,000/- for the offence under\nSection\n, IPC, and direct that in case of failure to pay the fine for\neither of the two offences, the appellant shall undergo a further\nimprisonment for a period of six months. We make it clear that the\nsentences of imprisonment for the two offences will run concurrently.\nIf the appellant has already undergone the punishment imposed by\nthis judgment, his bail bonds shall stand discharged.\n\n18. The appeal is allowed to that extent.\n\n.……………………….J.\n(A. K.\nPatnaik)\n\n………………………..J.\n(Gyan Sudha\nMisra)\nNew Delhi,\nOctober 31, 2013.",
