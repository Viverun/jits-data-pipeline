Ramakrishnan, J:\n\n The respondent wife in OP.No.613/2003 on the file of the\n\nFamily Court, Kottayam at Ettumannor is the appellant in Mat.A.No.\n\n681/2007. The petitioner/wife in OP.No.455/2004 on the file of the\n\nsame court is the appellant in Mat.A.No.682/2007 and\n\nrespondent/husband in the same case is the appellant in Mat.A.No.\n\n653/2007.\n\n 2. OP.No.613/2003 on the file of the Family Court, Kottayam\n\nat Ettumannor was filed by the husband for dissolution of marriage\n\nunder Section 13(1)(ia) and (ib) of \nHindu Marriage Act\n (hereinafter\n\ncalled the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion. It is alleged\n\nin the petition that the marriage between the petitioner and the\n\nrespondent was solemnized on 8.11.1977 as per Hindu custom and\n\nthey lived together as man and wife till 12.4.1982. Two children\n\nwere born to them in that wedlock, one of whom was a boy and the\n\nother is a girl. While the respondent was residing with the\n\npetitioner, she was not obeying him and not loyal to him. She had\n\nremoved 15 sovereigns of gold ornaments from his custody without\n\nhis knowledge and consent. She was always in the habit of picking\n\nup quarrel with him for even silly matters. On 12.4.1982, without\n\nany reasonable cause, she withdrew from the company of the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 2\n\nhusband along with the children who are aged 3 = years and two\n\nyears respectively. Though he made all attempts for a reunion, she\n\nwas not amenable for the same. She started residing in her parental\n\nhouse. She had denied all his marital rights. While so, petitioner\n\nsent a notice to the respondent asking her to resume cohabitation\n\nfor which she sent a reply expressing her unwillingness to join him.\n\nSo petitioner filed OP(HMA)No. 53/82 before the Sub Court,\n\nKottayam for restitution of conjugal rights\n u/s 9\n of the Act. Though\n\nan attempt was made of settling the issues between them, and to\n\nrestart their life together with the children, that failed due the\n\nadamant attitude of the respondent. Respondent contested the\n\ncase and after evidence, the Sub Court, Kottayam granted a decree\n\nfor restitution of conjugal rights holding that the respondent was\n\nresiding separately without any reasonable cause. The respondent\n\nfiled appeal before this court as MFA.No. 348/84 and by judgment\n\ndated 16.3.1987, this court has set aside the decree passed by the\n\nSub Court and dismissed the petition. The petitioner was a graduate\n\nworking in the Dairy Department of Government of Kerala as a\n\nsenior Gazetted Officer. The respondent was working as Secretary\n\nin Govt. Employees Co-operative Bank, Kottayam and getting good\n\nincome. He was also backed by a good fortune as inherited by his\n\nfather. After dismissal of the petition for restitution of conjugal\n\nrights, though he made attempts to have a reunion considering the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 3\n\nwelfare of the children through mediators including the office\n\nbearers of the SNDP sakha of the area, but it failed. The attitude of\n\nthe respondent wife amounts to cruelty and desertion and so he had\n\nno other option except to file the petition for divorce on the above\n\ngrounds as there was no possibility of reunion and the marriage tie\n\nbetween them had been irrecoverably broken down. Hence the\n\npetition.\n\n 3. He amended the petition as per order in IA 1498/2005\n\nwherein he had alleged that the respondent used to behave very\n\ncruelly both physically and mentally towards the petitioner from\n\n12.04.82 onwards. She was living separately from the petitioner.\n\nShe was making baseless and false accusation against the petitioner\n\nwith malicious intention to defame him before the public and\n\nrelatives. She was accusing him as a womanizer and a drunkard.\n\nShe without any basis accusing him that he was having illegal\n\nrelationship even with his close relatives and several women.\n\nMaking such false and baseless accusation caused great anguish\n\nand mental torture to the petitioner. She was sending false and\n\nfrivolous complaints to the higher authorities. Even after lapse of 21\n\nyears from the date of separation, she filed false complaints against\n\nhim before the DYSP kottayam and a case was registered under\n\nsection 498A\n of the Indian Penal Code and the same was charge\n\nsheeted and he was arrested on 11.11.2003 and later he was\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 4\n\nreleased on bail on 12.11.2003. She made complaints to his higher\n\nauthorities so as to see that his employment is lost to him. On\n\n11.10.04 at about 4 P.m at the instance of the respondent, nine\n\npersons armed with weapons attacked him from the courtyard of his\n\nhouse with an intention to kill him and he escaped from them. On\n\nseveral occasions, respondent through her henchmen attempted to\n\nattack his sisters, Ammini and Janaki. A vigilance enquiry was\n\ninitiated at the instance of the respondent and memo has been\n\nissued to him on 23.12.2003. She tried to prevent his family\n\npension being disbursed. Petitioner filed WP(C).No.33813/2004\n\nbefore this court and obtained police protection. So the act of the\n\nrespondent amounts to cruelty.\n\n 4. Respondent earlier filed counter admitting the marriage and\n\nbirth of the children but denying the allegations of cruelty and\n\ndesertion alleged in the petition. She denied that she was cruel to\n\nhim while they were living together and she was picking up quarrel\n\nwith him for silly things. In fact he was torturing her demanding\n\nmore dowry and picking up quarrel with her for flimsy and silly\n\nmatters. In fact he deserted her and the children and he is residing\n\nwith another woman. He had extorted the entire assets of the\n\nrespondent. She has already filed a petition for getting back her\n\nassets. In fact respondent never withdrew from the company and\n\ncohabitation of the petitioner. In fact it was he who had deserted\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 5\n\nher. She admitted the filing of OP (HMA)No.52/82 by the petitioner\n\nand the same was being allowed by the Sub Court, later she filed\n\nappeal which has been allowed. The high court while allowing the\n\nappeal filed by her categorically held that she was living separately\n\nwith reasonable cause. She was only opposing the prayer for\n\ndivorce on the ground that her children became major and their\n\nmarriage has to be solemnized in a decent manner and she did not\n\nwant to be titled as a divorcee. She never expects any benefits and\n\ngrace from the petitioner. She is looking after herself and children\n\nfrom 1982 onwards. Son was studying for MBBS course and\n\ndaughter is studying for MCA. She never approached the petitioner\n\nfor any help or assistance. She is not intended to cohabitate with\n\nthe petitioner since he is having another wife and child. But she is\n\nnot interested in divorcing the petitioner. There is no cause of action\n\nfor the petitioner to file the petition for divorce. So she prayed for\n\ndismissal of the petition.\n\n 5. After amendment, she filed additional written statement\n\nreiterating all her contentions in the earlier statement. According to\n\nher, they are residing separately from 1982 onwards. Petitioner\n\nand others attempted to assassinate her and so she had to escape\n\nfrom the matrimonial home due to fear of death. According to her,\n\neven prior to the marriage, the petitioner had a female child\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 6\n\nthrough a relative which has become a talk among the family\n\nmembers. The residential building and property purchased by the\n\nfather was sold by the petitioner. Anticipating some risk in\n\ncontinuing the relationship, on 11.4.1982, the petitioner and the\n\nlady attempted to kill her and so she had to leave the matrimonial\n\nhome with children. Thereafter, he never cared to look after her.\n\nOn 9.2.1989, the petitioner married another lady and a female child\n\nwas born to them in that relationship and she was a Plus One\n\nstudent then. The petitioner's family consist of more than 12\n\nmembers and all of them were residing separately, even without\n\ncaring their parents and they are in enemical terms with each other.\n\nSuch an unpleasant situation and surroundings of the petitioner's\n\nfamily is the root cause for his misbehaviour and bad character.\n\nDuring 1981, the brother of the petitioner deserted his wife\n\ncomplaining that the petitioner was having sexual relationship with\n\nher. Due to the cruelty of the petitioner, his sister Janaki and her\n\nhusband committed suicide after consuming poison at the residence\n\nof the petitioner. He had quarrelled with his younger brother by\n\nname Ponnappan who was murdered by his elder brother Gopi. The\n\ndaughter of his elder sister Santhama, committed suicide by\n\nhanging on account of the harassment met at the hands of the\n\npetitioner and his sister Janaki. Such a person is now making\n\nallegations of cruelty against the respondent. When she arranged\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 7\n\nthe marriage of their daughter, apprehending that the respondent is\n\nlikely to approach him, he had transferred his properties in the\n\nname of his second wife and published seveal scandalous news\n\nagainst her and her daughter, and on account of such attitude and\n\nact, several proposals were dropped by the groom's party and the\n\nmarriage of her daughter was delayed. The second wife of the\n\npetitioner and his sister Janaki abused her with obscene language\n\nover phone. On 21.4.2004 at about 9.45 a.m, Mini and Janaki wth\n\nthe petitioner attempted to beat the respondent using slippers in\n\nfront of her office and due to the intervention of an autorickshaw\n\ndriver, she was saved from that attack. A complaint was filed\n\nbefore the Chief Judicial Magistrate court. Even prior to that, she\n\nwas threatened by the petitioner, his second wife and sister on\n\nseveral occasions. On 8.12.2003, there was an attempt of attack\n\nin conspiracy with the petitioner with his friend who was a defaulter\n\nof a bank, in which, the respondent was working, as she had taken\n\nsteps to recover the dues from him. Frivolous complaint filed by the\n\npetitioner before the Sub Inspector of Kottayam East police station\n\nwas later dismissed. So, there was no merit in the petition and she\n\nprayed for dismissal of the same.\n\n 6. The respondent in the above case, the wife, filed\n\nO.P.No.455/04 claiming certain amounts from the\n\nrespondent/husband originally. Thereafter, additional second\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 8\n\nrespondent was impleaded with the following allegations: The\n\nmarriage between the petitioner and respondent was solemnized on\n\n8.11.1977 and two children were born to them in their wedlock and\n\nshe was deserted by the 1st respondent and she is now residing\n\nalong with her children in her parental house and later shifted to her\n\nself acquired residential building. On 11.4.1982, he had brutally\n\nmanhandled her and attempted to kill her and so, out of fear of\n\ndeath, she had to leave the matrimonial home with the children. He\n\nfiled HMA (OP)No.553/82 before Sub Court, Kottayam for restitution\n\nof conjugal rights and the same was allowed and she filed MFA\n\nNo.348/84 before this Court and the same was allowed by this\n\nCourt by judgment dated 16.3.1987 setting aside the order passed\n\nby the Sub Court, Kottayam. Thereafter, no steps were taken by the\n\n1st respondent against that judgment. The elder son was doing his\n\nHouse Surgency at Bulgaria and her daughter was expecting\n\nadmission for M.Tech course. The 1st respondent filed\n\nO.P.No.613/03 for divorce. Even before filing of the petition, the\n\nrespondent married another woman by name Mini, Thinavitha\n\nChathil, Karinkulam on 9.2.1989. On the basis of the complaint\n\ngiven by the petitioner, a case was registered as Crime no.481/03\n\nunder \nSection 498A\n of IPC against him. A female child by name\n\nPournami was born to them in that wedlock. From 11.4.1982\n\nonwards, the husband was not looking after the affairs of the wife\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 9\n\nand children.\n\n 7. At the time of marriage, 292 gms. of gold ornaments and\n\nRs.5,000/- was given towards the share of the petitioner in her\n\nfamily and the gold ornaments and the amounts have been\n\nmisappropriated by him without her knowledge. Since he insisted\n\nfor more and more amounts, the father of petitioner purchased 5.5\n\ncents of property with a residential building in Kottayam, as per sale\n\ndeed no.1873/79 in the joint names of the petitioner and the 1st\n\nrespondent, out of which, 2 cents was purchased in the name of her\n\nfather. The entire amount for purchase of the property was paid by\n\nher father and the respondent did not contribute any amount for the\n\nsame. Later, on 22.6.1979, the 2 cents of property purchased by\n\nher father was gifted in her favour in full and final settlement of her\n\nclaims over the family property due to the coercion exerted by the\n\n1st respondent. During June 1980, petitioner went to her parental\n\nhome and at that time, the respondent had taken all the household\n\narticles in the residential building and the same was rented out to a\n\nthird party. On 11.6.1981, he sold that property vide sale deed\n\nnos.2006/81 and 2007/81 for a total consideration of Rs.25 lakhs\n\nwhich was in his custody. Later utilising a portion of the amount, he\n\npurchased 13 cents of property near railway station at Kottayam,\n\nout of which, 6.5 cents was purchased in the name of the\n\npetitioner and the remaining 6.5 cents was purchased in the name\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 10\n\nof respondent for a consideration of Rs.20 lakhs and the balance\n\namount of Rs.5 lakhs was misappropriated by him. Thereafter, he\n\nsold his portion by sale deed no.1338/83 and purchased another\n\nproperty at Kadamuri using that amount vide sale deed No.601/92\n\nand he is residing in that house. So she is entitled to get Rs.15\n\nlakhs from the respondent being the balance sale consideration\n\nobtained by sale of 5.5 cents property near Parthas textiles, as he\n\nwas only a trustee for that property for and on behalf of the\n\npetitioner and he is liable to return the same.\n\n 8. She had suffered severe mental and physical cruelty and\n\nshe has been denied all the benefits of a family life and since the\n\nmarital rights had not been dissolved, he had committed breach of\n\ncontract of not looking after the wife and children and she is entitled\n\nto get compensation for the same from him. The petition schedule\n\nproperty was purchased by the 1st respondent by utilising the\n\nsources obtained from her father and using that amount by virtue of\n\nSale Deed No.601/92 and the same is liable to be set aside, as he\n\nhad no right over the same and the entire propety belongs to her\n\nand she is entitled to get vacant possession from the possession of\n\nthe 1st respondent as he is in possession of the property as a\n\ntrustee and she is also entitled to get injunction restraining him\n\nfrom selling the property or trespassing into the property. The\n\nproperty was entrusted with the 1st respondent as a trustee which\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 11\n\nwas created by her father making her as beneficiary. This Court\n\nwhile disposing the appeal filed by her against the decree of\n\nrestitution of conjugal rights granted by the Sub court, found that\n\nshe was residing separately with reasonable cause. He is now\n\ntrying to sell the property to the second wife with an intention to\n\ndeny enjoyment of the property by the petitioner and children and\n\nhe is trying to get a decree for divorce against her as well. The\n\nproperty obtained in the name of the first respondent is a binami\n\ntransaction as the entire fund was utilised by selling the property of\n\nthe petitioner which was given to her towards her share in the\n\nfamily property. He had got 53 cents of land from his family\n\nproperty which he had sold to the second wife vide sale deed No.\n\n1197/03. So she prayed for return of the gold ornaments or its\n\nvalue and damages and also for return of the balance sale\n\nconsideration which she quantified the amount as Rs.36,55,000/-\n\nwith 18% interest and for a declaration that the petition schedule\n\nproperty belongs to her and her children, and direct the respondent\n\nto entrust vacant possession of the same after cancelling sale deed\n\nNo.601/92 and for permanent prohibitory injunction restraining him\n\nand his men from committing any act of waste in the property and\n\nalienating the same to any third party and inducting strangers in the\n\nproperty or creating any encumbrance.\n\n 9. The original respondent filed counter contending as follows:\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 12\n\nThe suit is not maintainable. The present suit has been filed as a\n\ncounter blast to O.P.No.613/03 filed by him for divorce. The\n\nallegation that he married a lady by name Mini and a chlid was born\n\nto them in that wedlock is not correct. Due to the influence of the\n\npetitioner, Kottayam East police registered a case against him and\n\nhe challenged the same before this Court by filing\n\nCrl.M.C.No.1457/04 and further proceedings in the crime were\n\nstayed by this Court. The allegation that the property covered by\n\ndocument no.1817/1979 having an extent of 5.5 cents was\n\npurchased by utilising the funds of her father is not correct and\n\nhence denied. In fact, the entire consideration was paid by him out\n\nof his funds. The property having an extent of 3 cents with a\n\nbuilding therein was purchased for a total consideration of\n\nRs.30,000/- in the joint names of himself and the petitioner, and\n\nthe western 2 cents of property was purchased in the name of the\n\nfather of the petitioner for a consideration of Rs.15,000/-. Since\n\nthe respondent was not in station at the time when the document\n\nwas registered, her father's name was also included without his\n\nconsent. When this was challenged, the father of the petitioner had\n\ngifted his right in the property in favour of the petitioner. So it is\n\nclear from this that the entire amount was paid by the respondent\n\nand no amount was paid by her father. It is admitted that he had\n\nsold the property as per Document Nos.2006 and 2007 of 1981\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 13\n\ndated 11.6.1981. But the allegation that it was sold for Rs.25 lakhs\n\nis not correct. In fact, the property covered by document\n\nno.2006/81 was sold for a consideration of Rs.50,000/- and the\n\nproperty covered by document no.2007/81 in the name of the\n\npetitioner was sold for a consideration of Rs.30,000/- and that\n\namount has been entrusted to her. Utilising Rs.50,000, they had\n\npurchased 13 cents of land in the joint names of the petitioner and\n\nthe respondent showing the extent of the property as 6.5 cents\n\neach for a total consideration of Rs.13,000/- and the balance\n\namount was used for discharging the liabilities. The property in the\n\nname of the petitioner was sold by her while she was residing\n\nseparately. The allegation that he had purchased the property at\n\nKadamuri using the funds obtained by sale of the property is not\n\ncorrect. That property was purchased in the joint names of himself\n\nand his elder sister Janaki for an amount of Rs.25,000/-. He\n\npurchased the present property by using a fund obtained by taking\n\nloan of Rs.64,000/- from his department and the petitioner has no\n\nright over the same. The petitioner is not entitled to get any amount\n\nbeing the balance consideration obtained by sale of 5.5 cents\n\nobtained earlier. She is not entitled to get any compensation for\n\nbreach of contract said to have been committed by respondent. In\n\nfact she is residing separately and she had no intention to come and\n\nreside with him. In fact he is entitled to get compensation from the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 14\n\npetitioner for not discharging her obligation as a dutiful wife. The\n\npetitioner is not entitled to get any declaration in respect of\n\nDocument No.601/92 and she is not entitled to get any injunction or\n\npossession as claimed. There was no trust created as claimed. So\n\nhe prayed for dismissal of the petition.\n\n 10. Subsequently the 2nd defendant was impleaded in the\n\ncase as per the order in IA.No.1909/2005 on the allegation that\n\nthe original respondent had sold the property to the additional\n\nsecond respondent with a view to defeat the right of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n 11. The 2nd respondent entered appearance and filed counter\n\nto the original petition contending as follows:\n\n The application is not maintainable. She came to know that\n\nthe petitioner is the wife of the 1st respondent and she had\n\ndeserted him long back and she was not aware of the other\n\nallegations in the petition. The allegation that she married the first\n\nrespondent 9.2.1989 is false. It is true that a case has been\n\nregistered as Crime No.481/2003 by Kottayam East Police Station\n\nagainst the first respondent alleging that he had committed the\n\noffence punishable under \nSection 498 A \nof the Indian Penal Code\n\non the basis of false allegations made by her. Subsequently, she\n\nwas also added as additional second accused. The allegation that\n\na child was born to the relationship between herself and the first\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 15\n\nrespondent is not correct. Though she is having a child, it was not\n\nborn in the relationship with the first respondent.\n\n 12. She filed Crl.MC.No.935/2004 before this Court and\n\nthe further proceedings in C.C.No.203/2004 of Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate Court, Kottayam was stayed. Later the case against\n\nher was quashed. She purchased 10 cents of land with an\n\nincomplete building therein as per document No.979/2003 dated\n\n11.6.2003 of Puthupally Sub Registrar's Office and she has been in\n\npossession and enjoyment of the same. The petitioner is not\n\nentitled to get any declaration or injunction in respect of that\n\nproperty. She had spent huge amount for completing the\n\nbuilding and making improvements in the property. She purchased\n\nthe property 14 months prior to the date of institution of the\n\npetition. The first respondent has no right or title over the above\n\n10 cents and that is separated by well defined boundaries. She\n\npurchased the property for valuable consideration. When she\n\npurchased the property, the sister of the first respondent, Smt.\n\nK.A. Gouri and brother K.A. Krishnan and Kunhumon called her\n\nover phone and told her that it was intended to be conveyed in\n\ntheir favour by the first respondent and purchase of 10 cents out\n\nof the same is ill motivated and they will teach a lesson to her.\n\nThey were enmical terms towards the first respondent. She had no\n\nintention to purchase any more portion of the respondents'\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 16\n\nproperty. The second respondent also purchased some more\n\nproperty from the first respondent as per document\n\nNo.1197/2003. The petitioner is not entitled to get any relief\n\nagainst this respondent and she prayed for dismissal of the\n\npetition.\n\n 13. Both these cases were tried jointly and evidence was\n\nrecorded in OP.No.613/2003 treating that case as a leading case.\n\nThe petitioner in OP.No.613/2003 was examined as PW1 and his\n\nsister was examined as PW2 and Exts.A1 to A40 were marked on\n\nhis side. The respondent in that case was examined as RW10. Her\n\nson was examined as RW11. Power of attorney holder of the\n\nsecond respondent in OP.No.455/2004 was examined as RW12\n\nand other witnesses were examined as RWs1 to 9 on the side of the\n\nrespondent in that case and Exts.B1 to B26 and Ext.X1 were\n\nmarked on the side of the respondent in that case. After\n\nconsidering the evidence on record, the Court below came to the\n\nconclusion that the petitioner in OP.No.613/2003 has proved\n\ncruelty and desertion and allowed the application and granted a\n\ndecree for divorce dissolving the marriage between the petitioner\n\nand the respondent in that case. Aggrieved by the same, the\n\nrespondent in OP.No.613/2003 has filed Mat.A.No.681/2007.\n\n 14. The Court below allowed OP.No.455/2004 in part and\n\nrejected the prayer for declaration of title and possession over\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 17\n\nthe property claimed in the petition and also rejected the claim for\n\nreturn of balance sale consideration said to have been in the\n\npossession of the first respondent in that case and damages\n\nclaimed for breach of contract said to have been committed by him\n\nin denying the marital obligation to be performed by him to her, but\n\nallowed the application directing the first respondent to return 30\n\nsovereigns of gold ornaments and Rs.5001/- entrusted at the time\n\nof marriage and also directed him to pay a sum of Rs.3,00,000/-\n\ntowards educational expenses of the daughter and in the alternate\n\nof return of gold ornaments directed him to pay a sum of Rs.\n\n1,80,000/- with 6% interest and educational expenses of the\n\nchildren quantified as Rs.3 lakhs together with 6% interest from\n\nthe date of the order. There was interest ordered at the same rate\n\nfor return of gold ornaments and money obtained at the time of\n\nmarriage was directed to be paid from the date of petition namely\n\n6.8.2004. Dissatisfied with the quantum of amount ordered and\n\nrejection of the other claims, the petitioner in that case filed\n\nMat.A.No.682/2007 and aggrieved by the order to return the gold\n\nornaments or its value and Rs.5001/- and the educational\n\nexpenses to the tune of Rs. 3 lakhs, the first respondent filed\n\nMat.A.No.653/2007. Since both these appeals arose out of a\n\ncommon order on the basis of common evidence, this Court is\n\nalso disposing of all these appeals by a common judgment. For\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 18\n\nconvenience sake, we are referring to the status of the parties as\n\nmentioned in OP.No.455/2004 before the Court below as all the\n\nparties are party to that proceedings alone.\n\n 15. Heard Sri. K.Gopalakrishna Kurup, learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellant in Mat.A.No.681/2007,\n\nMat.A.No.682/2007 and the first respondent in\n\nMat.A.No.653/2007, Sri. Varghese C. Kuriakose, learned counsel\n\nappearing for the respondent in Mat.A.No.681/2007, the first\n\nrespondent in Mat.A.No.682/2007 and the appellant in\n\nMat.A.No.653/2007.\n\n 16. The senior learned counsel for the petitioner argued that\n\nthe Court below was not justified in granting a decree for divorce on\n\nthe ground of cruelty and desertion. In fact, the petition filed by\n\nthe 1st respondent for restitution of conjugal rights as OP(HMA).\n\nNo.53/1982 on the file of the Sub Court, Kottayam though decreed\n\nby that court, was later set aside by this Court as per judgment in\n\nMFA.No.348/1984 dated 16.3.1987 and that will go to show that\n\nshe is residing separately from the first respondent and her\n\nseparation is justified by reasonable cause and due to cruelty\n\nalleged by her against the first respondent and as such the\n\nhusband is not entitled to get a decree for restitution of conjugal\n\nrights and allowed the appeal and dismissed the petition filed by\n\nhim for that ground. So he cannot tack on that period for desertion\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 19\n\nor cruelty so as to claim divorce on that ground and that will\n\noperate as resjudicata between the parties. There was no cruelty\n\nor desertion thereafter occurred and as such, the first\n\nrespondent is not entitled to get divorce and the Court below is not\n\njustified in granting a decree for divorce on the ground of cruelty\n\nand desertion. She had relied on the decision reported in an\n\nunreported decision of the Delhi High Court in Mat.A.(FC)\n\nNo.82/2014 dated 6.1.2017 between Mrs. Nisha Rani v.\n\nSri.Sohan Singh Nehra.\n\n 17. As regards the dismissal of the claims in\n\nOP.No.455/2004 is concerned, according to the learned senior\n\ncounsel, the Court below had not properly appreciated the\n\nevidence and in fact, the evidence will go to show that the\n\nproperty was purchased by her father and by sale of those\n\nproperties, the subsequent properties were obtained and he had\n\nsold the property without her consent and appropriated the\n\namount and as such, he is liable to return the amount and the\n\npetitioner is entitled to get declaration and injunction as prayed\n\nfor. He had also argued that on account of the wrongful act of\n\nthe first respondent, she was denied the matrimonial status and\n\nthe benefit of co-habitation with the first respondent and thereby\n\nhe had committed breach of contract of promise of not fulfilling\n\nhis marital obligation towards the petitioner. Further having\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 20\n\nadmitted that the first respondent has not paid any amount for\n\nthe maintenance of the children and educational expenses etc\n\nand he had not discharged the obligation of the father to give in\n\nmarriage of her daughter born to them in that wedlock, the\n\nCourt below ought to have believed the evidence of RWs10 and\n\n11 and granted the entire amount claimed under that head.\n\n 18. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the first\n\nrespondent argued that though this Court has set aside the\n\npetition for restitution of conjugal rights filed by him, even\n\nthereafter the cohabitation did not resume and she was filing\n\nfalse complaints one after the other before the police and also to\n\nthe higher authorities of his department with false allegations so\n\nas to cause mental stress for him and that will amount to mental\n\ncruelty. Further she was trying to project him as a womanizer\n\nand a drunkard which she knew is false and such false allegations\n\nhave been raised by her in all her statements filed before the\n\nCourt below in different proceedings knowing that those\n\nallegations are false and intended only to bring down his\n\nreputation in the society and that will amount to cruelty. Further\n\nher evidence will go to show that he had no intention to come\n\nback and revive cohabitation with him and she had even denied\n\nthe access of children with him and there is no possibility of\n\nreunion and their marriage relationship has been irretrievably\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 21\n\nbroken down and they are residing separately since 11.4.1982\n\nonwards. So there is no animus on the part of the petitioner to\n\ncome and join the first respondent and as such, the Court below\n\nwas perfectly justified in granting the relief of divorce on the\n\nground of cruelty and desertion and those findings do not call for\n\nany interference. He had relied on the decisions reported in\n\nPraksh Chandra Kapoor v. Ritu Kapoor (2015 KHC 2020),\n\nMonika @ Mona v. Chandra Prakash (2015 KHC 3189), Rashmi\n\nPorwal v. Vivek Porwal (2015 KHC 1384), Kamal Singh Sisodia\n\nv. Rama Sisodia (2015 KHC 2303), Rajesh Shivhare v.\n\nArchana Shivhare (2015 KHC 1340), Vinita Sixena v. Pankaj\n\nPandit (2006 KHC 479), Supratim Datta v. Moutushi Sen\n\n(2015 KHC 5333), Sheelu v. Amar Singh and Another (2016\n\nKHC 2786), Rohin Kumar v. Silvia (2015 KHC 2930), Imlesh v.\n\nAmit (2014 KHC 3107) Jayachandra v. Aneel Kaur (2005 KHC\n\n7), Jyotsna Sharma v. Gaurav Sharma (2015 KHC 2653),\n\nDavid M.D v. K.G. Mercy (2013 (3) KHC 739), Jagbir Singh V.\n\nNisha (2015 KHC 3455), Srinivas K. v. K. Sunitha (2014 KHC\n\n4728), Geeta Sharma v. Anil Kumar Sharma (2015 KHC 1067),\n\nBeena S.S. v. Sundaresan and others (\n2016 (1) KHC 355),\n\nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli\n (2006 KHC 621) and Suman v.\n\nGajender (2015 KHC 3201) in support of his case.\n\n \n19. As regards the claim of the wife in OP.No.455/2007 is\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 22\n\nconcerned, the learned counsel has argued that since the right in\n\nthe property of the petitioner was sold by her after the\n\nrelationship strained, it cannot be said that he is in custody of those\n\namount. Further, not claiming the return of gold ornaments till\n\n2004 and claiming the same after lapse of 22 years of their\n\nrelationship strained, the malafides on the part of the petitioner has\n\nto be presumed and except the interested testimony of RW10,\n\nthere is no evidence to prove this fact. So the Court below was not\n\njustified in ordering return of gold ornaments or its value and\n\nRs.5001/- said to have been given at the time of marriage. Once\n\nshe had a case that it was he who had deserted her in 1982, the\n\nright to claim those articles arose for her and as such, the Court\n\nbelow should not have granted the relief in her favour. He had\n\nalso argued that the right to claim maintenance and marriage\n\nexpenses or educational expenses is given to the daughter under\n\nSection 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and the\n\nmother is not entitled to claim that amount as daughter alone is\n\nentitled to claim that amount as such right has given only to the\n\ndaughter. Further the daughter ought to have filed the suit for that\n\namount within 3 years of attaining majority and failure to claim\n\nthat amount will amount to forfeiture of right which cannot be\n\nsubstituted through her mother. So the Court below should not\n\nhave granted a relief of Rs.3 lakhs in favour of the petitioner\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 23\n\ntowards educational expenses of the daughter. He had relied on\n\nthe decisions reported in Ashwani Kumar v. State of\n\nUttranchal and others (\n2005 KHC 1547) Roopa J.M v. Jallur\n\nMusturappa and Others\n (2006 KHC 3719), Viswambharan v.\n\nDhnaya (2005 KHC 119), Jagdish Jugtawat v. Manju Lata\n\n(2002 KHC 1275), Binulal K. V. Roopa R.S. (2011 (3) KHC 738)\n\nand Commissioner of Gift Tax v. Indira Devi (1998 KHC 403)\n\nin support of his case.\n\n 20. Before going to the facts of the case, we shall consider the\n\nprecedents and the legal aspects arising in the case on the basis of\n\nfacts.\n\n 21. In the decision reported in Jayachandra v. Anil Kower\n\n(2005 KHC 7), the apex court has held that:\n\n \"Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage may\n\n be defined as willful unjustifiable conduct of such character as to\n\n cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental or/as give\n\n rise to a reasonable apprehension of such danger\".\n\n 22. It is further observed in the same decision that:\n\n \"To constitute cruelty, the conduct complained should be\n\n grave and weighty so as to come to the conclusion that the\n\n petitioner spouse cannot be reasonably expected to live with the\n\n other spouse. It must be something more than serious than ordinary\n\n wear and tear of married life. The conduct taking into consideration\n\n of the circumstances and the background has to be examined to\n\n reach the conclusion whether the conduct complained of amounts to\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 24\n\n cruelty in matrimonial law. Conduct has to be considered as noted\n\n above in the background several factors such as social status of\n\n parties their education, physical and mental condition, custom and\n\n tradition. It is difficult to lay down a presice definition or to give\n\n exhaustive description of the circumstances which would constitute\n\n cruelty. It must be of the type as to satisfy the conscience of the\n\n court. That the relationship between the parties had deteriorated to\n\n such an extent due to the conduct of the other spouse that it would\n\n be impossible for them to live together without mental agony,\n\n torture or distress to entitle the complaining spouse to secure\n\n divorce. Physical violence is not absolutely essential to constitute\n\n cruelty and a consistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable\n\n mental agony and the torture may well constitute cruelty within the\n\n meaning of \nSection 10\n of the Act. Mental cruelty may consists of\n\n verbal abuses and insults by using filthy and abusive languages\n\n leading to constant disturbance of mental peace of other party\"\n\n 23. In the decision reported in Srinivas K.v. K.Sunitha\n\n(2014 KHC 4728), it has been held that:\n\n \"Filing false complaint against husband and his family\n\n members u/s.498A and \nSection 307\n of Indian Penal Code will\n\n amount to matrimonial cruelty defined\n u/s.13(1)(ia)\n of Hindu\n\n Marriage Act\".\n\n 24. It is further held in the same decision that:\n\n \"Though irretrievable break down of marriage though\n\n not a ground of divorce as yet, but Supreme Court in exercise\n\n of its plenary powers under \nArticle 142\n has power to pass such\n\n decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete\n\n justice in any case or order pending before it. It is also held in\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 25\n\n the same decision that, criminal complaint was filed by the wife\n\n subsequent to filing of husband's divorce petition and being the\n\n subsequent event could have been looked into by court.\"\n\n 25. \nIn the decision reported in \nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli\n\n( 2006 KHC 621), it has been held that:\n\n \"The conduct of one of the spouse is such that,it is\n\n impossible for other spouse to live together and making false\n\n complaints before the police and authorities causing innumerable\n\n mental stress and making false and defamatory allegations will\n\n amount to mental cruelty\".\n\n \n26. The same view has been reiterated in the decision\n\nreported in \nVinita Saxena v. Pankaj Pandit\n (2006 KHC 749).\n\n 27. In the decision reported in Geetha Sharma v. Anil\n\nkumar Sharma (2015 KHC 1067), the Punjab and Haryana High\n\nCourt held that:\n\n \"A launching false criminal case against the husband and\n\n family members at the behest of the wife, which ended in acquittal\n\n will amount to cruelty. In the same decision it has been held that,\n\n if the spouse is not joining the husband for a long period in spite of\n\n attempts made for that purpose will amount to desertion.\"\n\n 28. In the decision reported in Jagvir Singh v. Nisha (2015\n\nKHC 3455), the Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that:\n\n \"False allegation by the wife against the husband that\n\n subject to cruelty with alleged demand of dowry will amount to\n\n mental cruelty. Further publication in newspaper of alleged\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 26\n\n cruelty committed in connection with alleged demand of dowry\n\n bringing disrepute to family and husband will amount to mental\n\n cruelty and husband is entitled to get divorce on that ground.\"\n\n 29. The same view has been reiterated in the decision\n\nreported in Rohin Kumar v. Silvia (2015 KHC 2930), Imlesh v.\n\nAmit (2014 KLT 3107), Jyotsna Sharma v. Gaurav Sharma\n\n(2015 KHC 2653).\n\n 30. In the decision reported in Suman v. Gajender (2015\n\nKHC 3201) it has been held that:\n\n \"Making false allegation of illicit relation of husband made\n\n by wife will amount to mental cruelty.\"\n\n 31. \nIn the decision reported in \nBeena S.S. v. Sundaresand\n\nand Other\n (2016(1) KLT 355) a Division Bench of this court has\n\nheld that:\n\n \"In order to establish grounds for mental cruelty, there\n\n should be sufficient pleadings and evidence which is substantial\n\n and material in nature to the extent of creating a permanent\n\n mental distress and ever lasting disturbance in the mind of a\n\n person alleging cruelty. Bond created by marriage cannot be\n\n dissolved by relying of flimsy, shallow and baseless allegations.\"\n\n 32. It is further held in the decision that:\n\n \"Stray and inconsequential allegation made even if proved\n\n will not by itself contribute to the factum of cruelty.\"\n\n 33. In the decision reported in David M.D. v. Mercy K.G.\n\n(2013 (3) KHC 739), it has been held that:\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 27\n\n \"Making false allegations against the husband and child\n\n and making false complaints to the authority by the wife will\n\n amount to cruelty.\"\n\n 34. The same view has been reiterated in the decision\n\nreported in Sheelu v. Amar Singh and another (2016 KHC\n\n2786), Supratim Datta v. Moutushisen (2015 KHC 5333), and\n\nMangesh Balkrushna Bhoir v. Sauleena Mangesh Bhoir (2016\n\nKHC 3057).\n\n 35. In the unreported decision of the Delhi High Court bin M.F.\n\n(F.C.) 82/2014, between Mrs. Nishrani v. Sri.Sohan Singh\n\nNehra, dated 6.1.2017, it has been held that, mere wear and tear\n\nin the family life will not amount to cruelty, relying on the decision\n\nin Ravikumar V. Julmidevi (2010 (4) SCC 476), where Supreme\n\nCourt has observed that, it may be noted only after the amendment\n\nof the said Act by amending Act 68 of 1976, desertion became a\n\nground for divorce. On the question of desertion the High Court\n\nheld that in order to prove a case of desertion, the party alleging\n\ndesertion must not only prove that the other spouse was living\n\nseparately but also must prove that there is an animus desarandi on\n\nthe part of the wife and the husband must prove that he has not\n\nconducted himself in a way which furnishes reasonable cause for the\n\nwife to stay away from the matrimonial home.\n\n 36. In the decision reported in Rajesh Shivhare v. Archa\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 28\n\nShivhare (2015 KHC 1340), it has been held that:\n\n \"Husband and wife living separately for 11 years and love\n\n was lost and emotions had dried up and efforts failed, then it will\n\n amount to desertion.\"\n\n 37. The same view has been reiterated in the decision\n\nreported in Kamal Singh Sisodia v. Rama Sisodia (2015 KHC\n\n2303), Rashmi Borwal v. Vivek Borwal (2015 KHC 1384),\n\nMonica @ Mona v. Chandraprakesh (2015 KHC 3189), Prakash\n\nChandra Kapour v. Ritu Kapour (2015 KHC 2020).\n\n 38. It is clear from the above dictums that, if the conduct and\n\nbehavior of the wife is of such a nature that it causes mental agony\n\nand stress making it impossible for the husband to live together or\n\ncontinue the marital tie, not possible will amount to mental cruelty.\n\nFurther filing false complaints against the husband and his family\n\nmembers alleging offences\n u/s.498A\n and \n406\n of Indian Penal Code\n\nand making false allegations of illicit relationship with other woman\n\nor leading immoral life and spreading such allegations among the\n\npublic on the part of the wife will amount to mental cruelty. If there\n\nis long separation making the reunion impossible and there is\n\ndrained marital relationship between the parties and all attempts\n\nmade on the part of the husband for a reunion failed, then it will\n\namount to desertion on the part of the wife. With this principles in\n\nmind, the case in O.P.No. 613/2003 against which\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 29\n\nMat.A.No.681/2007 filed has to be considered.\n\n 39. The above petition was filed by the husband for divorce on\n\nthe ground of desertion and cruelty on the part of the wife. The fact\n\nthat the marriage between them was solemnised on 8.11.1977 and\n\ntwo children, a male and a female were born to them in that\n\nwedlock and they were residing separately from 12.04.82 is not in\n\ndispute. It is also not in dispute that husband filed O.P.(HMA)No.\n\n53/82 before Sub Court, Kottayam for restitution of conjugal rights,\n\nwhich was allowed originally but later set aside by this court by\n\nExt.B17 judgment in MFA.No.348/84 dated 16.03.1987. It is also\n\nnot in dispute that finding of this court for allowing the appeal was\n\nthat there was an incident occurred on 12.04.1982, which is\n\nsufficient cause for the wife to live separately and as such the\n\nhusband is not entitled to get the relief of restitution of conjugal\n\nright as the wife is justified for her separate residence. So till that\n\ndate, the allegations are not sufficient to come to the conclusion\n\nthat there was desertion on the part of the wife.\n\n 40. But it is also an admitted fact that even thereafter the\n\nattitude of the wife of causing mental stress to the husband\n\ncontinued and there was no attempt on the part of the wife to join\n\nthe husband. It is an admitted fact that on the basis of the\n\ncomplaint filed by the wife before the Dy.S.P., Kottayam evidenced\n\nby Ext.A19(b) dated 28.10.2003 which resulted in registering of the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 30\n\ncrime Ext.A14 against the husband and the 2nd respondent one Mini\n\nalleging offences\n u/s.498A\n and \n494\n of Indian Penal Code and after\n\ninvestigation, it resulted in filing a final report before Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate Court, Kottayam, where it was taken on file as\n\nC.C.203/2004. It is also an admitted fact that he was arrested on\n\n11.11.2003 in connection with the above crime as Crime\n\nNo.481/2003 of Kottaym East Police Station and he was released on\n\nbail by the magistrate on the next day. It is also an admitted fact\n\nthat, the husband and the said Mini who were accused in the above\n\ncase filed Crl.M.C.9358/2004, and Crl.M.C.1457/2004 before this\n\ncourt and this court by Ext.A24 judgment dated 21.06.2006\n\nquashed the proceedings in C.C.203/2004 of Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate Court, Kottayam holding that, there was no prima face\n\nevidence to prove the subsequent marriage and the allegation of\n\ndemand for dowry so as to attract the offence u/s.498A of Indial\n\nPenal Code, alleged after nearly 21 years of separation causes\n\ndoubt regarding the allegation and it was made only to enable the\n\npolice to register a case and harass the accused persons. The fact\n\nthat the case itself was filed after 21 years of separation by the wife\n\nwill go to show that it was made only for the purpose of harassing\n\nand causing mental stress to the husband as a vindictive method on\n\nthe part of the wife.\n\n 41. It is also seen from the counter statement filed by her in\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 31\n\nO.P. 53/1982 and the counter statement filed by her in the present\n\nproceedings that, she had made allegations against the husband\n\nprojecting him a person having immoral character having illicit\n\nrelationship with several women including his brothers wife and his\n\nniece without any basis and made to examine RW9 one\n\nSanthamma, the wife of one of the brothers of her husband to\n\nprove these allegations and reading of her deposition will go to\n\nshow that, she is having enmity with the petitioner herein. All\n\ntheses things will go to show that her attempt was to bring loss of\n\nreputation for her husband before the public. Though she had\n\nproduced Exts.B1 to B8, B16 and examined Rws 1 to 9 to prove that\n\nthe husband is having illicit connection with a lady by name Mini,\n\nwhom he married on 09.05.1989 and having a female child and he\n\nis residing with her, the evidence of those witnesses are not helpful\n\nto prove these facts. Further it is also seen from the documents\n\nproduced by the petitioner namely Ext.A13 dated 12.12.97, an\n\norder of suspension issued on him by the department on the basis\n\nof the complaint given by the wife and later it was revoked. It is\n\nalso seen from the documents produced namely Exts.A19(a),\n\nExt.A20 and subsequent documents produced before this court and\n\nreceived as per order in I.A.1942/2014 and marked as Ext.A41 to\n\nA49 will go to show that even now she was filing complaints before\n\nthe authorities on the basis of which inquiries have been initiated by\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 32\n\nthe department preventing him to get his terminal benefits. Further\n\nit is also seen from Ext.A45 that a case registered at the instance of\n\nthe father of the wife as Crime No.550/2006 of Ettumanoor police\n\nstation which was tried as C.C.74/2007 u/s. 341, 506(1) and 294(b)\n\nread with \nSection 34\n of Indian Penal Code by Judicial First Class\n\nMagistrate-I, Ettumanoor was ended in acquittal.\n\n 42. Further the evidence of RW10, the wife also will go to\n\nshow that, she had no intention to join her husband, but she wanted\n\nto retain the label of his wife and she does not want to be known as\n\na divorcee. So all these things will go to show that even after her\n\nleaving of the matrimonial home on 12.04.1982, the wife was filing\n\ncomplaints against the husband before the police and also before\n\nthe authorities after lapse of 21 years of their separation which later\n\nended in acquittal of the husband and other persons against whom\n\nthe cases have been registered. It is also seen from the documents\n\nproduced before the Court below and this Court that on account of\n\nthe act of the wife, petitioner has to face several enquiries\n\ndepartmentally and he was put under suspension for sometime and\n\nthereafter he was reinstated as per the orders of this court. It is\n\nalso seen from the evidence available on record that even at the fag\n\nend of his service, he has to face certain enquiries which resulted in\n\nwithholding of disbursal of his pensionary benefits as well. Further\n\nshe is also making allegations against the husband that he is having\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 33\n\nillicit connection with several women and having children in those\n\nrelationship as well which has not been proved by producing proper\n\nevidence. The persons examined and the documents produced for\n\nthis purpose on the side of the wife is not sufficient to prove those\n\naspects as the persons examined have no direct knowledge about\n\nthe contents of the documents produced or the identity of the\n\npersons mentioned in those documents. A cumulative effect of all\n\nthese acts of the wife will go to show that her intention is to harass\n\nthe husband making his matrimonial life impossible with her and\n\nthese things were done with an intention to vindicate her personal\n\nvendata against him giving him unnecessary mental stress and\n\nagony and loss of reputation in the society and that will amount to\n\nmental cruelty entitles the husband to get a divorce on the ground\n\nof cruelty\n u/s.13(1) (ia)\n of Hindu Marriage Act.\n\n 43. As regards the desertion aspect is concerned, the attitude\n\nof the wife will go to show that she had no intention to join the\n\nhusband. Even after the dismissal of the application for restitution\n\nof conjugal right, there was no attempt on the part of the wife to\n\nhave reunion with her husband taking into account the welfare of\n\nthe children. On the other hand even thereafter she was residing\n\nseparately without having any communication with the husband and\n\nnot even allowing the children to meet their father. So under such\n\ncircumstances, the attitude of the wife living separately for nearly\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 34\n\n25 years even now without any intention to rejoin and making the\n\nrelationship more worse by filing complaint after complaint against\n\nhim will go to show that she had permanently gone out of the\n\nmatrimonial home with an intention not to return making the\n\nrelationship irretrievably broken down and unrepairable so as to\n\ninfer animus deserdanti on her part. So the court below was\n\nperfectly justified in coming to the conclusion that the husband had\n\nproved desertion on the part of the wife and he is entitled to get\n\ndivorce on that ground as well and rightly granted the relief of\n\ndivorce both on the grounds cruelty and desertion and we do not\n\nfind any reason to interfere with the same. So the Mat.A.No.\n\n681/2007 fails and the same is hereby dismissed.\n\n 44. As regards Mat.A.No.682/2007 and Mat.A.No.653/2007\n\nare concerned, the case of the petitioner in the court below was that\n\nat the time of marriage 295 grams of gold ornaments and cash of\n\nRs.5,001/- was entrusted to the husband. Further as insisted by\n\nthe husband, her father had purchased 5.5 cents of land and\n\nbuilding near Parthas Textiles in Kottayam as per sale deed\n\nNo.1817/79 evidenced by Ext.B10 dated 29.05.79. Out of 5.5 cents\n\nfather of the petitioner had purchased 2 cents with building therein\n\nas per the same document, later he had gifted that right in favour of\n\nthe petitioner as per Ext.B11 Gift Deed No.21040/79 dated\n\n22.06.79. According to the petitioner, later this property was sold\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 35\n\nas per Ext.B12 Sale Deed No.2006/81 dated 11.06.1981 and\n\nExt.B22 Document No.2007/81 of the same date, according to the\n\npetitioner, for a total consideration of Rs.25 lakhs, out of which by\n\nutilizing Rs.20 lakhs, he had purchased 13 cents of property of 6.5\n\ncents each in favour of the petitioner and first respondent and sold\n\nhis right in that property as per Ext.B13 document No.1338/83.\n\nThereafter he had purchased the petition schedule property as per\n\nsale deed No.601/92 evidenced by Ext.B14 dated 30.04.92. So\n\naccording to the petitioner, he is in possession of Rs.5 lakhs, the\n\nbalance consideration obtained by the sale of property covered by\n\nExt.B10 and B11. She had also claimed Rs.15 lakhs being the value\n\nof the share of the petitioner in the property. She had also claimed\n\nthat she is entitled to get compensation for breach of contract\n\ncommitted on the side of the husband and also for education and\n\nmarriage expenses of the children to the tune of Rs.10 lakhs each\n\nand she had claimed a total amount of Rs.36,55,000/- as follows:\n\n i The amount entrusted at the time of marriage Rs.5,000\n\n ii. Market value of 30 sovereigns of\n\n gold ornaments Rs. 1,50,000/-\n\n iii. Remaining sale consideration while selling the\n\n property at Kottayam near Parthas Textiles\n\n excluding the utilized amount for purchasing\n\n the schedule property Rs.15,00,000/-\n\n iv. Damages for the petitioner for spoiling her life\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 36\n\n and sufferings caused to her by the respondent Rs. 5,00,000/-\n\n v. Damage towards breach of contract by\n\n conducting second marriage without dissolving\n\n the marriage of the petitioner Rs. 5,00,000/-\n\n vi. Expenses for higher studies and marriage of the\n\n daughter Rs. 10,00,000/-\n\n -------------------\n\n Total Rs.36,55,000/-\n\n 45. She had also claimed declaration of title over the\n\nplaint schedule property and also for injunction restraining him\n\nfrom alienating the property. The 2nd respondent was later\n\nimpleaded as purchaser of a portion of the property from the 1st\n\nrespondent.\n\n 46. The first respondent filed objection denying the claims\n\nmade. According to him, the properties were purchased with his\n\nfunds and there is no amount available with him as claimed as\n\nexcess consideration and she is not entitled to get any damages. It\n\nis on account of act of the petitioner that the marriage relationship\n\nhas been ruined and he had also stated that there is bar of\n\nlimitation for claiming the reliefs regarding the property. He had\n\nnot mentioned anything about his liability to pay maintenance to\n\nthe child daughter or marriage expenses. He prayed for dismissal\n\nof the petition.\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 37\n\n 47. The additional second respondent filed written statement\n\ndenying the allegations and also stating that she had purchased a\n\nportion of the property for valuable consideration and the petitioner\n\nis not entitled to get any relief in respect of the same.\n\n 48. The fact that the petitioner and the first respondent\n\nwere wife and husband and a property having an extent of 5.5\n\ncents was purchased in the names of the petitioner, the first\n\nrespondent and the father of the petitioner as per Ext.B10 Sale\n\nDeed No.1817/79 is not in dispute. It is also an admitted fact that\n\ntwo cents of property was purchased as per Ext.B10 by the father\n\nof the petitioner was later gifted to her as per Ext.B11 Gift Deed\n\nNo.21040/79 dated 22.6.1979. It was admitted by RW10 in her\n\nevidence that at the time when this property was purchased, the\n\nfirst respondent was not in station and when he came to know\n\nthat a portion of the property was purchased in the name of her\n\nfather, he questioned the same and it was thereafter that the\n\nfather had executed Ext.B11 gift deed. It was also admitted by\n\nRW10 that the property covered by Exts.B10 and B11 were later\n\nsold by her and the first respondent as per Sale Deed No.2006/81\n\nand 2007/81 for the sale consideration mentioned in the\n\ndocument. She had no case that the sale consideration\n\nmentioned in those documents is less than the actual consideration\n\nreceived. It was also admitted by her that a property having an\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 38\n\nextent of 13 cents was purchased in the joint names of the\n\npetitioner and the 1st respondent by using that amount with 6.5\n\ncents each and later they have sold the same separately.\n\nAdmittedly, sale of this property was after their separation on\n\n12.4.1982. There is no evidence adduced on the side of the\n\npetitioner to prove that the property covered by Exts.B10 and B11\n\nwere sold for a total consideration of Rs.25 lakhs and only Rs.20\n\nlakhs was used for purchasing 13 cents of land in the joint\n\nnames of the petitioner and the first respondent of 6.5 cents\n\neach and the balance amount of Rs.5 lakhs was with the first\n\nrespondent. So under such circumstances, the Court below was\n\nperfectly justified in coming to the conclusion that the first\n\nrespondent was not in possession of the balance consideration of\n\nRs.5 lakhs and he is not liable to account to the petitioner and\n\nrightly rejected that claim.\n\n 49. As regards the declaration of right over the petition\n\nschedule property which was obtained as per Document No.601/92\n\nevidenced by Ext.B14 dated 30.4.1992, it cannot be said that\n\nany amount was contributed by the petitioner for purchase of that\n\nproperty. In fact, she had admitted that she had sold 6.5 cents of\n\nland obtained in her favour and she had utilized that amount\n\nfor herself. The father of the petitioner was not examined to prove\n\nthat the entire consideration was paid by him for purchasing the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 39\n\nproperty covered by Ext.B10. Further, the evidence of PW1 and the\n\ndocuments produced by him evidenced by Ext.A35 and Ext.A13\n\nwill go to show that he had taken loan from the Department.\n\nFurther Ext.B5 coupled with the evidence of RW5 will go to show\n\nthat building regularization application was filed by the first\n\nrespondent. Further all these things have transpired after they\n\nwere living separately and Exts.A25 to A28 ration cards will go to\n\nshow that the first respondent was residing alone in the house\n\nafter the petitioner had left the matrimonial home. So under such\n\ncircumstances, the Court below was perfectly justified in coming to\n\nthe conclusion that she is not entitled to declaration or injunction\n\nas prayed for as she has no right over the property covered by\n\nDocumentNo.601/92 and rightly rejected those claims and we do\n\nnot find any reason to interfere with that finding.\n\n 50. As regards compensation claimed from the first\n\nrespondent for breach of contract of marriage and contracting\n\nsecond marriage, it is seen from the evidence adduced that the\n\npetitioner is also responsible for the ruining of the relationship\n\nbetween them and even after the disposal of the appeal filed by\n\nher against OP(HMA)No.53/1982 of Sub Court, Kottayam, she did\n\nnot take any steps for reunion and the attempts made by the first\n\nrespondent for reunion was not accepted by her as well. On the\n\nother hand, she was filing complaints after complaints before the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 40\n\npolice and the departmental authorities of the first respondent\n\ncausing hardship to him making the relationship more worse than\n\never. So under such circumstances, the Court below was perfectly\n\njustified in rejecting the claim for compensation of Rs.10 lakhs\n\nand we do not find any reason to interfere with the same.\n\n 51. As regards the claim for educational expenses and future\n\nmarriage expenses of their unmarried daughter, in fact there was\n\nnothing mentioned in the counter statement regarding the same.\n\nSection 20 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act gives\n\nright for the unmarried daughter to claim maintenance from her\n\nfather or mother till the date of marriage if she is not having\n\nsufficient income to maintain herself. Admittedly at the time when\n\nthe original petition was filed by the mother, the daughter was not\n\nmarried and she was a student. So there is no possibility of any\n\nincome for her.\n\n 52. \nIn the decision reported in \nRoopa J.M v. Jallur\n\nMusturappa and Others\n (2006 KHC 3719), it has been held\n\nthat there is a duty cast on the father to maintain the minor\n\ndaughter till her marriage and meet her marriage expenses. At\n\nthe time when the daughter was not married, when the petition\n\nwas filed and she had married subsequent to the institution of the\n\nsuit or during the pendency of the suit, it was for the father to\n\nmeet the marriage expenses irrespective of the fact that the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 41\n\nmarriage was conducted by the mother by taking loan.\n\n 53. In the decision reported in Viswambharan v. Dhnaya\n\n(2005 KHC 119), it has been held that a Hindu unmarried\n\ndaughter on attaining majority is entitled to continue her claim for\n\nmaintenance from the father until marriage if she is unable to\n\nmaintain herself out of her own earnings or property. The same\n\nview has been reiterated by the Apex Court in the decision\n\nreported in Jagdish Jugtawat v. Manju Lata (2002 KHC 1275).\n\nIn that decision it has been held that though \nSection 125\n of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure entitle the daughter to claim\n\nmaintenance from her father but a combined reading of \nsection\n\n125\n Cr.PC and Section 20(3) of Hindu Adoption and\n\nMaintenance Act makes it clear that she is entitled to get\n\nmaintenance till marriage and that can be awarded under\n\nSection 125\n Cr.PC in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings.\n\n 54. In the decision reported in Binulal K. V. Roopa R.S.\n\n(2011 (3) KHC 738), a Division Bench of this Court has held that\n\nin a proceedings under \nGuardians and Wards Act\n seeking\n\ncustody by the husband, there is no provision for payment of\n\nlitigation expenses invoking \nSection 24\n of the Hindu Marriage Act\n\nand awarding litigation expenses under that Act is without\n\njurisdiction and \nSection 7(1)(f)\n of the Family Court Act cannot be\n\ninvoked for that purpose as what is contained in \nSection 7\n is\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 42\n\nsubstantive law conferring right to sue on specific grounds. That\n\ndictum is not applicable to the facts of this case.\n\n 55. \nIn the decision reported in \nCommissioner of Gift Tax v.\n\nIndira Devi\n (1998 KHC 403), this Court had considered the\n\nquestion as to whether any gift given post marriage to secure\n\nher marriage will be liable to be exempted from Gift Tax and it is\n\nheld that it does not come within the purview of Section 20\n\nHindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and as such the person\n\nwho gifted cannot claim exemption from payment of Gift Tax as\n\nthere is no legal obligation to pay any amount to the daughter after\n\nthe marriage. That dictum is also not applicable to the facts of this\n\ncase.\n\n 56. In the decision reported in Vijaykumar Jagdishrai\n\nChawla, Indian Inhabitant v. Reeta Vijayakumar Chawla,\n\nIndian Inhabitant (2011 (108) AIC\n\n356=MANU/MH/1079/2011=III(2011 DMC 687), the question\n\narose as to whether the wife can seek relief of maintenance for\n\nand on behalf of her major daughter and the Bombay High Court\n\nhas held that subsection (3) of \nSection 20\n is exception which\n\nprovides for the obligation of a person to maintain his or her\n\ndaughter who is unmarried and is unable to maintain herself out of\n\nher own earnings or other property and \nSection 21\n of the Act\n\ndefines the term dependents. Clause 5 of \nSection 21\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 43\n\nencompasses unmarried daughter as a dependant. Having regard\n\nto the relevant provisions therefore there can be no doubt that the\n\nunmarried daughter is entitled to receive maintenance amount\n\nfrom her father or mother as the case may be and so long as\n\nshe is unable to maintain herself out of her own earnings and other\n\nproperty and if he is being looked after by the mother, then the\n\nfather is also liable to share the liability of providing maintenance\n\nto his daughter and mother is entitled to recover the amount on\n\nbehalf of the daughter.\n\n 57. \nIn the decision reported in \nSmt. Sneh Prabha v.\n\nRavinder Kumar\n (AIR 1995 SC 2170), it has been held that\n\ndaughters who are grown up living with mother and maintained\n\nby mother and she is earning handsome salary however in view\n\nof Section 20 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act considering\n\nthe burden to pay towards education and other expenses and give\n\ndaughter for marriage, husband was ordered to pay certain\n\namount to daughters till their marriage or they earn their\n\nlivelihood and reserved the right of the daughters to get more\n\nfinancial assistance at the time of their marriage. That was a case\n\nwhich arose out of the proceedings under the \nHindu Marriage Act\n\nand not under Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. At the time\n\nwhen divorce was granted, this aspect was also considered by the\n\nApex Court and granted the relief to the daughter who was not\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 44\n\neven a party to that proceedings at the instance of the mother.\n\n 58. \nIn the decision reported in \nKirtikant D. Vadodaria v.\n\nState of Gujarat and another\n (1996(4) SCC 479), it has been\n\nheld that according to the law of the land with regard to\n\nmaintenance, there is an obligation on the husband to maintain\n\nhis wife which does arise by reason of any contract express or\n\nimplied, but out of jural relationship of wife and husband\n\nconsequent to the performance of marriage. Such an obligation of\n\nthe husband to maintain his wife arises irrespective of the fact\n\nwhether he has or has no property as it is considered an\n\nimperative duty and solemn obligation of husband to maintain his\n\nwife. The husband cannot be heard to say that he is unable to\n\nmaintain due to financial constrains so long as he is capable of\n\nearning. Similarly it is obligation on the part of a son to maintain\n\nhis aged father and mother by reason of personal obligation. But\n\nunder old Hindu Law, the obligation was imposed on the son\n\nalone But now the present day Hindu Law extends this obligation\n\nboth on sons and daughters. Further Section 18 of the Hindu\n\nAdoption and Maintenance Act gives a right to the wife to claim\n\nmaintenance from her husband during her life time and by virtue\n\nof the above said Act, both son and daughter are liable to\n\nmaintain aged or infirmed parents including childless stepmother\n\nwhen the latter is unable to maintain herself. It is well settled that\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 45\n\na son has to maintain his mother irrespective of the fact whether\n\nhe inherits any property or not from his mother as on the basis of\n\nthe relationship alone he owes a duty and obligation, legal and\n\nmoral to maintain his mother who has given birth to him. Further\n\naccording to \nSection 20\n of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance\n\nAct, 1956 a Hindu is under legal obligation to maintain his wife,\n\nminor son, unmarried daughters and aged or infirmed parents.\n\n 59. \nIn the decision reported in \nMohinder Singh v. Ravneet\n\nKaur\n (AIR 2007 Punjab and Haryana 49), it has been held that\n\nthe minor children are entitled to claim maintenance from both\n\nfather and mother if both are capable to maintain the child, liability\n\ncan be fixed on both.\n\n 60. In the decision reported in Thadisina Chinna Babu Rao, S/o.\n\nlate Ankkayya v. Kum. Thadisina Sarala Kumari D/o. Chinna Babu\n\nRao (AIR 2010 NOC 330 (AP)=II(2010 DMC 806)\n\n=Manu/AP/0480/2009, it has been held that unmarried daughter\n\nwho claimed maintenance from her parents irrespective of the\n\nreligion which he belongs even after attaining majority and can\n\nmaintain a suit in the Family Court under \nsection 7\n of the\n\nFamily Courts Act and this can be claimed irrespective of\n\nreligion to which she belongs.\n\n 61. \nSection 3(b)\n of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act,\n\n1956 defines maintenance as follows:\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 46\n\n \"Maintenance includes\"\n\n (i) in all cases, provision for food, clothing, residence, education\n\n and medical attendance and treatment;\n\n (ii) in the case of an unmarried daughter, also the reasonable\n\n expenses of and incident to her marriage;\n\n 62. \nSection 20\n of the above said Act deals with maintenance\n\nof children and aged parents which reads as follows:\n\n \"20. Maintenance of children and aged parents:-\n\n (1) Subject to the provisions of this Section a Hindu is\n\n bound, during his or her lifetime, to maintain his or her\n\n legitimate or illegitimate children and his or her aged or\n\n infirm parents.\n\n (2) A legitimate or illegitimate child may claim\n\n maintenance from his or her father or mother so long as the\n\n child is a minor.\n\n (3) The obligation of a person to maintain his or her\n\n aged or infirm parent or a daughter who is unmarried\n\n extends insofar as the parent or the unmarried daughter,\n\n as the case may be, is unable to maintain himself or\n\n herself out of his or her own earnings or other property.\n\n Explanation:- In this section \"parent\" includes a\n\n childless stepmother.\"\n\n 63. It is an undisputed fact that under the old Hindu Law the\n\nliability to maintain the minor children was on the father and the\n\nright of the unmarried daughter to claim maintenance from the\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 47\n\nfather extended upto her marriage or till she is capable of\n\nmaintaining herself. But by virtue of subsequent development of\n\nlaw that obligation has been cast on both the parents if both are\n\nearning members and having sufficient means to meet the\n\nmaintenance of the children and the liability to maintain parents\n\ncast on both the son and the daughter by virtue of Section 20 of\n\nthe Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. It is also settled law\n\nthat by virtue of the obligations deriving from tradition that such an\n\nobligation to maintain the wife and the children on the\n\nhusband/father is personal and both moral and legal and that\n\narises not on account of any contract, but due to the relationship\n\ncreated by virtue of the marriage which creates a bond between\n\nthe parties making him responsible to look after the wife and the\n\nchildren and in the case of unmarried daughters to maintain them\n\ntill their marriage if they are unable to maintain themselves. By\n\nvirtue of the development of law, maintenance to the children has\n\nnow been a joint responsibility of of both the parents if both are\n\nearning. Even in a case where the unmarried daughter is living\n\nwith the mother, who is getting some income and being looked\n\nafter by her, she is entitled to claim maintenance from the father\n\nalso which includes the educational expenses and marriage\n\nexpenses. Merely because the mother is looking after the affairs of\n\nthe unmarried daughter including performance of marriage, it will\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 48\n\nnot exonerate the legal and personal obligation of the father to\n\ncontribute his share for that purpose. Since it is a joint\n\nresponsibility of both earning parents to perform the obligation of\n\nmaintaining unmarried daughters and giving them in marriage,\n\nthen the spouse who is spending the amount is entitled to get\n\ndue contribution from the other spouse who is not looking after\n\nthem and other spouse is not entitled to take advantage of the fact\n\nthat the unmarried daughter is being maintained by the mother\n\nwho is also an earning member. So an obligation to get\n\ncontribution from the husband by the mother has to be extended\n\nso as to strengthen the liability of the father to pay his due\n\ncontribution for the maintenance and welfare of his unmarried\n\ndaughter and he should not be left free of such liability.\n\n 64. As far as Hindu Marriage is concerned, it is not a\n\ncontract but a sacrament. At the time of marriage, both man and\n\nwoman take an oath before the Goddess of Fire that they will\n\nmutually understand each other and share the happiness and\n\nsorrow equally and try to make each other happy and shower\n\nlove on each of them. They will share the burden of running the\n\nfamily institution taking into the concept of family a basic unit and\n\nnecessity of the existence of that unit for the welfare of the\n\nsociety. The solemn oath taken by them creates a responsibility\n\non the husband to look after the wife and children both male and\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 49\n\nfemale till they attain majority and in the case of female takes up\n\nthe responsibility of looking after her till her marriage. Under the\n\nPristine Hindu Law, there is a responsibility on the father to give\n\ndaughter in marriage as in olden days, men alone are expected\n\nto work and earn money and it is the responsibility of the women\n\nto manage the household effectively which includes her\n\nresponsibility to look after the children and husband. But as the\n\ntime passes, women also started earning and shared the burden of\n\nrunning the family along with the husband and that was the reason\n\nwhy when the law was codified on the aspect of maintenance the\n\nburden of providing maintenance has been cast on the mother as\n\nwell. Since the responsibility of the father and mother to look\n\nafter the children has become mutual and joint as far as the\n\nchildren are concerned by virtue of the law and an option has\n\nbeen given to the children to proceed against either of them and\n\nby virtue of the precedents that liability has become joint, they are\n\nliable to share the responsibility in pro-rata to their income.\n\nThat be the case merely because the mother is earning and\n\nlooking after the daughter and taking the responsibility of giving\n\nher in marriage by burdening herself by taking loan will not\n\nabsolve the liability of the father to make his contribution for this\n\npurpose and the wife is entitled to enforce the liability of the father\n\nto provide his contribution if he has not contributed anything and\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 50\n\nthe entire burden has been taken by her for this purpose by\n\nvirtue of his obligation and oath taken at the time of marriage and\n\nbecome a liability on him by virtue of the law made by the\n\nlegislature and judge made precedents. Since it is a liability\n\narising out of a marriage relationship which wife is entitled to claim\n\nby virtue of the above principle, then the claim for that purpose\n\nby the mother will be maintainable before the Family Court by\n\nvirtue of \nSection 7\n Explanations (c) & (d) of the said Act. So the\n\ncontention of the counsel for the first respondent that he is not\n\nliable to pay the marriage expenses or educational expenses of\n\nan unmarried daughter and such a claim by the mother will not be\n\nmaintainable before the Family Court is unsustainable in law.\n\n 65. In this case, the marriage between the petitioner and\n\nthe first respondent and the birth of the children are not in dispute.\n\nThe first respondent had no case that after 12.4.1982, when the\n\npetitioner left the matrimonial home with the children, he had\n\nprovided any maintenance or looked after the affairs of the\n\nchildren. It is also brought out in the evidence of RWs10 and 11,\n\nthe wife and the son of the first respondent that the mother is\n\nlooking after the children and taking care of their education as\n\nwell. At the time when the above petition was filed in 2004, the\n\ndaughter was unmarried and she was a student and under the\n\nprotection of the mother. It is brought out in the evidence of Rws\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 51\n\n10 and 11 that the marriage of the daughter was solemnized\n\nduring the pendency of the proceedings and in spite of invitation\n\ngiven to the first respondent, he did not attend the marriage. He\n\nhad no claim that he had contributed anything for the same as\n\nwell. It is seen from Ext.B25 certificate issued by the employer of\n\nthe petitioner that she was getting a gross salary of Rs.26,910/-\n\nand after deduction, she was getting only Rs.1509.80Ps as take\n\nhome salary. Further Ext.B26 the certificate issued by Manager\n\nState Bank of Travancore, Changanassery dated 20.2.2007\n\ngives the details of the loans availed by the petitioner which\n\nincludes two education loans of Rs.4 lakhs and 3 lakhs, out of\n\nwhich an amount of Rs.4,13,262/- and Rs.2,51,484/- were due as\n\noutstanding and in one of the loans it appears that no payment has\n\nbeen made as on the date of certificate, the outstanding was\n\nshown Rs.4,83,914/- which appears to be the education loan\n\ntaken on behalf of the daughter as the date of payment would not\n\nhave been started. So under such circumstances, the first\n\nrespondent is also liable to contribute towards the education\n\nexpenses and marriage expenses of the unmarried daughter.\n\nThere is no evidence adduced on the side of petitioner to prove the\n\nactual expenses incurred for the marriage of the daughter.\n\nHowever considering the burden cast on the wife to discharge the\n\nliabilities of the unmarried daughter and expenses incurred for\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 52\n\nconducting the marriage especially when there is no evidence to\n\nshow that at the date of marriage, the daughter was employed\n\nand getting an income, the amount of Rs.3 lakhs fixed by the\n\nCourt below as share payable by the first respondent towards that\n\naccount appears to be reasonable and we do not find any reason\n\nto interfere with the same.\n\n 66. As regards the gold ornaments and amount paid at the\n\ntime of marriage of the petitioner is concerned, she had adduced\n\nevidence as RW10 and produced Ext.B8 marriage register which\n\nwas proved through RW8, the Secretary of Anandashramam SNDP\n\nSakha Yogam. It is seen from Ext.B8, 292 grams of gold ornaments\n\nwith its details and Rs.5001 was given by the parents of RW10 at\n\nthe time of her marriage. This was proved through RW8. He was not\n\ncross examined at all. So the genuineness of the document and its\n\ncontents thereof were not disputed. Further RW10 had categorically\n\nstated that out of these gold ornaments, 30 sovereigns of gold\n\nornaments and Rs.5001/- were taken by her husband and the same\n\nwas not returned. This aspect has not been challenged in the cross\n\nexamination as well. PW1 had no case that these gold ornaments\n\nwere taken back by the wife when she left the house. Further it will\n\nbe seen from the evidence of RW10 that on 12.4.82, there was an\n\nincident occurred in which she was manhandled and she had to\n\nleave the matrimonial home with the children. Neither PW1 nor\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 53\n\nRW10 had a case that thereafter there was any possisblity for RW10\n\ncoming to the matrimonial home and taking the gold ornaments.\n\nPW1 also had no case that till 2004, she had made any claim for the\n\nsame. PW1 also had no case that the gold ornaments and the\n\namount were used for any common purpose for the benefit of either\n\nRW10 or their children. When gold ornaments and the amount\n\ngiven to the wife in connection with the marriage were entrusted to\n\nthe husband, then it will be in the nature of a trust and so long as\n\nthe marital relationship continues, the trust created also will\n\ncontinue till the dissolution of marriage. Further when there is a\n\ntrust created, by virtue of Section 10 of the Trust Act, there is no\n\nlimitation so long as the trust continues. So under such\n\ncircumstances, once it is proved that gold ornaments and amount\n\nwas entrusted by the wife to the husband, then the burden is on the\n\nhusband to prove as to what happened to the gold ornaments and if\n\nit is taken by the wife when she left the matrimonial home, the\n\nsame has to be proved by the husband. No such evidence was\n\nadduced in this case by PW1. So under such circumstances, the\n\ncourt below was perfectly justified in holding that the wife is entitled\n\nto get return of either 30 sovereigns of gold ornaments or its value\n\nat the rate of Rs.6,000/- per sovereign totaling Rs.1,80,000/- and\n\nalso Rs.5001 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the\n\ndate suit namely 9.8.2004. But the court below was not justified in\n\f\n\nMat.A.No.681,682&653 of 2007 54\n\nrestricting the interest for the educational and marriage expenses\n\nfrom the date of order. She is entitled to get interest for that\n\namount also from the date of suit namely 9.8.2004. To that extent\n\nthe order passed by the court below has to be modified and on all\n\nother aspects the same has to be confirmed.\n\n So Mat.A.No.682/2007 is allowed in part granting interest on\n\nRs.3,00,000/- the amount payable towards educational and\n\nmarriage expenses from the date of petition namely 4.8.2004 till\n\npayment at the rate of 6% per annum instead of interest granted by\n\nthe court below from the date of order and on all other aspects the\n\norder passed by the court below is hereby confirmed.\n\nMat.A.No.653/2007 filed by the husband against the order in\n\nO.P.No.555/2004 of Family Court Kottayam at Ettumanoor is\n\ndismissed. Mat.A.No.681/2007 filed by the wife against the order of\n\ndivorce passed in OP.No.613/2003 of Family Court, Kottayam is\n\ndismissed and the decree dissolving the marriage passed by the\n\ncourt below is hereby confirmed. Considering the circumstances\n\nparties are directed to bear their respective costs in all the appeals.\n\n Sd/-\n\n A.M. SHAFFIQUE, JUDGE.\n\n Sd/-\n\n K.
