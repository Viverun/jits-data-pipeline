(learned Appellate Court), which affirmed the\n\n judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 21.12.2009\n\n passed by learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Court No. 1,\n\n Shimla H.P. (learned Trial Court). (For convenience, the parties\n\n shall hereinafter be referred to in the same manner as they were\n\n arrayed before the learned Trial Court.)\n\n1\n\n Whether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the judgment? Yes.\n\n 2\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n2. Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the present\n\npetition are that the victim Anshuman Sharma (PW-1) was\n\nmarried to accused Surinder Sharma on 17.02.2006 in Arya Samaj\n\nTemple, Solan, District Solan, H.P. against the wishes of her\n\nparents. The accused treated her properly for about one week\n\nafter her marriage. Thereafter he started compelling her to bring\n\ndowry from her parents. The victim refused to do so and the\n\naccused started abusing and beating her. He would beat her on\n\ntrivial matters and ask her to bring money from her parents. He\n\nwould keep her confined to her room and would not provide her\n\nany food, money or water. She was not allowed to meet anyone or\n\ngo anywhere. He would beat the victim in a state of intoxication.\n\nHe told her that in case she failed to bring any dowry from her\n\nparents, he would beat her to death. He asked her to call her\n\nmother and demand ₹30,000/-. The victim's mother declined to\n\npay the money. The parents of the accused resided with the\n\nvictim and the accused and they asked the accused about the\n\ndowry brought by the victim. The accused replied that the victim\n\nhad not brought any dowry. They abused the victim and gave her\n\nbeatings to her. They asked the victim to bring dowry or they\n\nwould marry the accused to some other person. The victim\n\n 3\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nbecame pregnant. The accused used to beat her. The victim had\n\nmarried against the wishes of her parents so she could not\n\ncomplain to any person; however, when the situation\n\ndeteriorated, she wrote letters to her parents narrating her woes.\n\nThe accused took the victim for her Sonography test, where it\n\nwas revealed that she was carrying a baby girl. The accused\n\nasked the victim to abort the fetus, however, the victim declined.\n\nThe accused started beating and hitting her on her stomach to\n\nforce her to abort the fetus. She gave birth to a baby girl on\n\n20.04.2007. The accused became angry. He did not care for the\n\nvictim. He would consume liquor and abuse the victim and her\n\ndaughter and beat the victim. He gave beatings to the victim on\n\n09.05.2007 at about 11:00 a.m. He tried to throw the baby girl on\n\nthe floor. The victim intervened and the baby fell on the bed. The\n\naccused gave beatings to the victim and told her that he would\n\nkill her. He left after some time and locked the door from the\n\noutside. He returned after some time and he pushed her out of\n\nhis room with the baby girl. The victim went to her parents\n\nhome. The accused called her and repeated his threats of killing\n\nher and her baby. The matter was reported to the police and\n\nF.I.R. (Ext.PW-12/F) was registered at the Police Station. S.I.\n\n 4\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nPrem Lal (PW-12) conducted the investigation. He seized the\n\nletters (Ext.P-1 to P-3), vide memo (Ext. PW-2/A). He visited\n\nthe spot and prepared the site plan (Ext. PW-12/A). The accused\n\nproduced the report of Sonography (Ext.PW-8/A), which was\n\nseized vide memo (Ext.PW-5/A). He recorded the statements of\n\nwitnesses as per their version. After completion of the\n\ninvestigation, the challan was prepared and presented before the\n\nCourt.\n\n3. The learned Trial Court charged the accused with the\n\ncommission of offences punishable under \nSection 498-A\n, \n342\n\nand \n506\n of IPC to which the accused pleaded not guilty and\n\nclaimed to be tried.\n\n4. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses to prove its\n\ncase. Anshuman Sharma (PW-1) is the informant. Pushpa\n\nSharma (PW-2) is the mother of the informant. Shankuntla\n\nShandil (PW-3) is the witness to recovery. Devinder Lakhanpal\n\n(PW-4) and Arun Sood (PW-7) are the family friends to whom\n\nthe victim had handed over the letters. Dinu Ram (PW-5) is the\n\nwitness to recovery but he did not support the prosecution case.\n\nMeena Thakur (PW-6), Amit Mohini (PW-10) and Asha Verma\n\n(PW11) are the house owners, who had rented the house to\n\n 5\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\naccused. Dr. Jitender Jhingta (PW-8), conducted the Sonography\n\nof the informant. Parkash Chand (PW-9), sold the land to\n\naccused Sureinder Sharma. SI Prem Lal (PW12), conducted the\n\ninvestigation of the case.\n\n5. The accused in his statement recorded under \nSection\n\n313\n of Cr.P.C. denied the prosecution case in its entirety. He\n\nstated that he was innocent and that he was falsely implicated.\n\nNo defence was sought to be adduced by him.\n\n6. The learned Trial Court held that the testimony of\n\nprosecution witnesses corroborated each other. The accused gave\n\nbeatings to the victim. He asked her to bring ₹30,000/- from her\n\nmother. The accused had threatened to do away with the\n\nvictim's life. Therefore, the learned Trial Court convicted the\n\naccused for the commission of an offence punishable under\n\nSection 498-A\n of IPC and sentenced him to undergo simple\n\nimprisonment for one year and pay a fine of ₹5000/- and in\n\ndefault of payment of fine to further undergo simple\n\nimprisonment for three months.\n\n7. Being aggrieved from the judgment and order passed\n\nby the learned Trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal,\n\nwhich was decided by learned Sessions Judge (learned Appellate\n\n 6\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nCourt). The learned Appellate Court concurred with the findings\n\nrecorded by learned Trial Court that the accused had subjected\n\nthe victim to cruelty soon after her marriage. He gave her\n\nbeatings and asked her to bring a dowry from her parents. The\n\nvictim wanted to save her marriage and the delay in reporting the\n\nmatter was not material. The incident of cruelty was committed\n\nwithin the four walls of the house, and normally direct evidence\n\nregarding cruelty or harassment of the women by her husband\n\nwas not available. The minor contradictions in the testimonies of\n\nthe prosecution witnesses were not sufficient to discard the\n\nprosecution case. There was no infirmity in the judgment and\n\norder passed by learned Trial Court; hence, the appeal was\n\ndismissed.\n\n8. Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgments\n\nand order passed by learned Courts below, the petitioner has\n\nfiled the present revision petition asserting that the learned\n\nCourts below erred in appreciating the material on record. They\n\nignored the provisions of \nSection 498- A \nof IPC. The relationship\n\nbetween the victim and the accused was not cordial and she filed\n\na false case to settle her score. The victim never made any\n\ncomplaint against the petitioner before any authority, which\n\n 7\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nmakes her version highly doubtful. There is no material\n\ncorroboration of the testimony of the victim from the\n\nindependent witnesses. Therefore, it was prayed that the present\n\npetition be allowed and the judgments and order passed by the\n\nlearned Courts below be set aside.\n\n9. I have heard Mr. Adarsh K. Vashishta, learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner and Mr. Lokender Kutlehria, learned Additional\n\nAdvocate General for the respondent/State.\n\n10. Mr. Adarsh K. Vashishta, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner submitted that the learned Courts below erred in\n\nappreciating the material placed before them. The statement\n\nmade by the victim was general without any particulars. She\n\nwanted to get rid of the petitioner and filed a false complaint to\n\nsecure the divorce. She had divorced the petitioner and has\n\nremarried, which shows that her purpose has been achieved. She\n\nnever made any complaint to any person regarding the\n\nharassment. There is no proof that the letters stated to have been\n\nwritten by her were delivered to her parents. Learned Courts\n\nbelow did not appreciate these facts and wrongly convicted the\n\npetitioner/accused. Hence, he prayed that the present petition be\n\nallowed and the petitioner be acquitted.\n\n 8\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n11. Mr. Lokender Kutlehria, learned Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral submitted that the petitioner had married the accused\n\nagainst the wishes of her parents. She was not permitted to leave\n\nher home. She initially resigned to her fate but when the\n\nbehaviour of the petitioner did not improve, she was forced to\n\nfile the complaint to the police. The learned Appellate Court had\n\nrightly pointed out that incidents of cruelty take place within the\n\nfour walls of the house and cannot be witnessed by the others.\n\nTherefore, there can be no corroboration of the testimony of the\n\nvictim. The testimony of the victim was duly corroborated by the\n\nletters written by her to her parents. Learned Courts below had\n\nrightly appreciated the material placed before them. Therefore,\n\nhe prayed that the present revision petition be dismissed.\n\n12. I have given considerable thought to the submissions\n\nof learned counsel for the parties made at the bar and have gone\n\nthrough the records carefully.\n\n13. It was laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nMalkeet Singh Gill v. State of Chhattisgarh\n, (2022) 8 SCC 204:\n\n(2022) 3 SCC (Cri) 348: 2022 SCC OnLine SC 786 that the revisional\n\ncourt is not an appellate court and it can only rectify the patent\n\n 9\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\ndefect, errors of jurisdiction or the law. It was observed on page\n\n207: -\n\n \"10. Before adverting to the merits of the contentions, at the\n outset, it is apt to mention that there are concurrent findings\n of conviction arrived at by two courts after a detailed\n appreciation of the material and evidence brought on record.\n The High Court in criminal revision against conviction is not\n supposed to exercise the jurisdiction like to the appellate\n court and the scope of interference in revision is extremely\n narrow. \nSection 397\n of the Criminal Procedure Code (in short\n \"\nCrPC\n\") vests jurisdiction to satisfy itself or himself as to the\n correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or\n order, recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any\n proceedings of such inferior court. The object of the\n provision is to set right a patent defect or an error of\n jurisdiction or law. There has to be a well-founded error\n which is to be determined on the merits of individual cases. It\n is also well settled that while considering the same, the\n Revisional Court does not dwell at length upon the facts and\n evidence of the case to reverse those findings.\n\n14. This position was reiterated in \nState of Gujarat v.\n\nDilipsinh Kishorsinh Rao\n, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1294 wherein it was\n\nobserved:\n\n \n\"13. The power and jurisdiction of the Higher Court under\n \nSection 397\n Cr. P.C. which vests the court with the power to\n call for and examine records of an inferior court is for the\n purposes of satisfying itself as to the legality and regularities\n of any proceeding or order made in a case. The object of this\n provision is to set right a patent defect or an error of\n jurisdiction or law or the perversity which has crept into such\n proceedings. It would be apposite to refer to the judgment of\n this court in \nAmit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chandra\n, (2012) 9 SCC\n 460 where the scope of \nSection 397\n has been considered and\n succinctly explained as under:\n\n \"12. \nSection 397\n of the Code vests the court with the power to\n call for and examine the records of an inferior court for the\n\n 10\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n purposes of satisfying itself as to the legality and regularity\n of any proceedings or order made in a case. The object of this\n provision is to set right a patent defect or an error of\n jurisdiction or law. There has to be a well-founded error and\n it may not be appropriate for the court to scrutinise the\n orders, which upon the face of it bear a token of careful\n consideration and appear to be in accordance with the law. If\n one looks into the various judgments of this Court, it\n emerges that the revisional jurisdiction can be invoked\n where the decisions under challenge are grossly erroneous,\n there is no compliance with the provisions of law, the finding\n recorded is based on no evidence, material evidence is\n ignored or judicial discretion is exercised arbitrarily or\n perversely. These are not exhaustive classes but are merely\n indicative. Each case would have to be determined on its own\n merits.\n\n 13. Another well-accepted norm is that the revisional\n jurisdiction of the higher court is a very limited one and\n cannot be exercised in a routine manner. One of the inbuilt\n restrictions is that it should not be against an interim or\n interlocutory order. The Court has to keep in mind that the\n exercise of revisional jurisdiction itself should not lead to\n injustice ex-facie. Where the Court is dealing with the\n question as to whether the charge has been framed properly\n and in accordance with law in a given case, it may be\n reluctant to interfere in the exercise of its revisional\n jurisdiction unless the case substantially falls within the\n categories aforestated. Even framing of charge is a much-\n advanced stage in the proceedings under the \nCrPC\n.\"\n\n15. The present revision has to be decided as per the\n\nparameters \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n16. The scope of \nSection 498-A\n of IPC was explained by\n\nHon'ble the Supreme Court in \nAluri Venkata Ramana vs. Aluri\n\nThirupathi Rao and Ors.\n (12.12.2024 - SC Order):\n\nMANU/SCOR/151680/2024, wherein it was observed: -\n\n 11\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n\"7. Firstly, the provision under \nSection 498-A\n IPC must be\nexamined. The said provision reads as under:\n\n \"498A. Husband or relative of the husband of a woman\n subjecting her to cruelty.- Whoever, being the\n husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,\n subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with\n imprisonment for a term which may extend to three\n years and shall also be liable to a fine.\n\n Explanation.-For the purposes of this section,\n \"cruelty\" means-\n\n (a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature\n as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide\n or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or\n health (whether mental or physical) of the\n woman; or\n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such\n harassment is with a view to coercing her or any\n person related to her to meet any unlawful\n demand for any property or valuable security or\n is on account of failure by her or any person\n related to her to meet such demand.\"\n\n8. \nSection 498A\n of the IPC was introduced in the year 1983\nwith the primary objective of protecting married women\nfrom cruelty at the hands of their husbands or their in-laws.\nThe section provides a broad and inclusive definition of\n\"cruelty,\" encompassing both physical and mental harm to\nthe woman's body or health. In addition, it covers acts of\nharassment designed to coerce the woman or her family into\nfulfilling unlawful demands for property or valuable security,\nincluding demands related to dowry. Notably, the provision\nalso recognizes acts that create circumstances leading a\nwoman to the point of suicide as a form of cruelty.\n\n9. The definition of \"harassment\" under the Explanation to\n\nSection 498A\n is specifically outlined in clause (b),\nindependent of the \"wilful conduct\" described in clause (a),\nthus necessitating a separate reading of the two. It is\nsignificant to note that the inclusion of the word \"or\" at the\nend of clause (a) clearly indicates that \"cruelty\" for the\npurposes of \nSection 498A\n can either involve wilful conduct\nthat causes mental or physical harm or harassment related to\n\n 12\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nunlawful demands, such as dowry. Moreover, these forms of\ncruelty can co-exist, but the absence of a dowry-related\ndemand does not preclude the application of the section in\ncases where there is mental or physical harassment\nunrelated to the dowry. In interpreting the provision, it is\ncrucial to consider the broader objective behind its\nintroduction to safeguarding women from all forms of\ncruelty, regardless of whether the nature of the harm\ninflicted includes a specific demand for dowry or not.\n\n10. The statement of objects and reasons for the introduction\nof this provision in the \nIndian Penal Code\n by The Criminal\nLaw (Second Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act No.45 of 1983)\nreads as under -\n\n \"The increasing number of Dowry Deaths is a matter\n of serious concern. The extent of the evil has been\n commented upon by the Joint Committee of the\n Houses to examine the workings of the \nDowry\n Prohibition Act\n, of 1961. Cases of cruelty by the\n husband and the relatives of the husband which\n culminate in suicide by, or murder of, the hapless\n woman concerned, constitute only a small fraction of\n the cases involving such cruelty. It is therefore\n proposed to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Code of\n Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act\n suitably to deal effectively not only with cases of\n Dowry Death but also cases of cruelty to married\n women by their in-laws.\"\n\n11. It is relevant to note the last line which explains that the\naim of the introduction of Section 498A in the \nIPC\n is not only\nto curb cruelty relating to dowry demand but also cases of\ncruelty to married woman by their in-laws. A reasonable\ninterpretation of this would be that cruelty within this\nsection goes beyond the definition of cruelty relating just to\ndowry demand.\n\n12. \nIn the judgment of \nU. Suvetha v. State\n (2009)6 SCC 757 this\nCourt outlined the necessary ingredients required to\nestablish an offence under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC, as\nfollows:\n\n \"7. Ingredients of Section 498-A of the Penal Code are:\n\n (a)The woman must be married;\n\n 13\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n (b) She must be subjected to cruelty or\n harassment; and\n\n (c) Such cruelty or harassment must have been\n shown either by the husband of the woman or by\n the relative of her husband.\"\n\n13. From the above ingredients reiterated by this Court, it is\nclear that an unlawful demand for dowry is not a pre-\nrequisite element to constitute \"cruelty\" under \nSection 498A\n\nIPC. It suffices that the conduct falls within either of the two\nbroad categories outlined in clauses (a) or (b) of the\nprovision, namely, wilful conduct likely to cause grave injury\nor mental harm (clause a), or harassment intended to coerce\nthe woman or her family to meet any unlawful demand\n(clause b). Therefore, either form of cruelty, independent of\ndowry demand, is sufficient to attract the provisions of\n\nSection 498A\n IPC and make the offence punishable under the\nlaw.\n\n14. Further, in the judgment of \nArvind Singh v. State of Bihar\n\n(2001) 6 SCC 407, this Court observed that -\n\n \"25. The word 'cruelty' in common English\n acceptation denotes a state of conduct which is painful\n and distressing to another. The legislative intent in\n Section 498-A is clear enough to indicate that in the\n event of there being a state of conduct by the husband\n to the wife or by any relative of the husband which can\n be attributed to be painful or distressing, the same\n would be within the meaning of the section\".\n\n15. The impugned judgment of the High Court carefully\nexamined several legal precedents pertaining to the two\ndistinct limbs of \nSection 498A\n IPC. The High Court correctly\nobserved that the decisions cited by the counsel for the\naccused did not establish that the wilful conduct referred to\nin clause (a) of Section 498A would only be considered as\ncruelty if it is coupled with a dowry demand or any unlawful\ndemand for property or valuable security, as specified in\nclause (b). The High Court rightly rejected this contention.\nHowever, following this observation, the High Court also\nnoted that the Appellant did not specifically allege a demand\nfor property or valuable security, and further concluded that\nthe allegation of the accused physically assaulting the\n\n 14\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n Appellant did not amount to \"wilful conduct\" as envisaged\n under clause (a) of \nSection 498A\n IPC. The judgment of the\n High Court primarily focused on the issue of whether a\n dowry demand is a necessary element for the applicability of\n \nSection 498A\n IPC. The conclusion it arrived at was that the\n two clauses of the provision must be read disjunctively,\n thereby confirming that the absence of a dowry demand does\n not preclude the application of the section. Despite this, the\n High Court went on to quash the criminal proceedings\n against the accused under \nSection 498A\n IPC. Notably, the\n High Court failed to provide adequate reasoning as to why\n the allegations made by the Appellant, specifically that she\n had been physically beaten did not amount to \"cruelty\"\n under \nSection 498A\n IPC. The High Court's decision to quash\n the proceedings appears to have been primarily influenced\n by the lack of a dowry-related demand in the case, without\n addressing the broader implications of the allegations of\n physical abuse, which can fall within the scope of \"cruelty\"\n as contemplated by the provision.\"\n\n17. It is apparent from the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court that the definition of cruelty not only covers the\n\nacts of harassment designed to coerce the woman or her family\n\ninto fulfilling unlawful demands of dowry but also recognizes the\n\nacts which involve mental or physical harm to the deceased.\n\n18. Victim Anshuman Sharma (PW-1) stated that she\n\nmarried the accused on 17.02.2006 in Arya Samaj Temple, Solan,\n\nDistrict Solan, against her parents' wishes. The accused treated\n\nher properly for 10-15 days after her marriage but thereafter he\n\nstarted beating her and asking her to bring dowry from her\n\nparents. When she refused, the accused beat and abused her. He\n\n 15\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\ndid not provide anything to her. He kept her confined in a room\n\nand did not permit her to meet anyone. He used to say that he\n\nwould kill her if she failed to bring any dowry. He dialled the\n\nvictim's mother and asked the victim to demand ₹30,000/-from\n\nher mother, however, the victim's mother declined to pay\n\nmoney. Her parents-in-law visited her matrimonial home. They\n\nenquired the accused about the dowry brought by her and the\n\naccused replied that she had not brought anything. They abused\n\nher. Her husband also gave beatings to her. They resided in the\n\nhouse of Chinta Mani and before that in the house of Krishan\n\nMohini. The accused continued to beat her even after she had\n\nbecome pregnant. The accused used to say that he would kill her\n\nand her family members by using 'Tantra'. She had married\n\ncontrary to her parents' wishes, so she sued to remain silent and\n\nsuffered the cruelty. She wrote letters to her parents (Ext.P-1 to\n\nP-3). She was taken to the doctor who told her that she had a\n\nbaby girl. The accused used to ask her to abort the foetus. He\n\nused to beat her. He even tried to kick her on her stomach so that\n\nshe would abort. She delivered a baby girl on 20.4.2007. The\n\naccused abused her after the delivery of the baby girl and\n\nthreatened to kill the victim and her daughter. He gave her\n\n 16\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nbeatings on 09.05.2007 from 11-12 a.m and tried to throw the\n\nbaby girl on the floor. She saved the baby girl and she fell on the\n\nbed. The accused left the room and locked it from the outside. He\n\nreturned after some time and turned her out of his home. She\n\ntook shelter in her parental home. The accused threatened to\n\nkill the victim and her daughter. She filed a complaint before the\n\npolice.\n\n19. She stated in her cross-examination that the accused\n\nhad treated her properly for 10-15 days after her marriage. She\n\nhad not reported the matter to any person because she tried to\n\nsave her marriage and thought that the behaviour of the accused\n\nwould improve. She used to reconcile the matter with the accused\n\nafter the quarrel to pacify him.\n\n20. The testimony of the victim is duly corroborated by\n\nthe letters (Ext.P-1 to P-3) written by her to her parents. She\n\nmentioned in the letter (Ext.P-1) that she had committed a\n\nwrong by marrying against her parents' wishes. The behaviour\n\nof her husband was not good towards her. Perhaps, the\n\nbehaviour would improve with time. She would try to live her life\n\nand should be forgiven as a stupid child.\n\n 17\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n21. Letter (Ext. P-2) reads that the victim was disturbed.\n\nHer husband beat her daily on one pretext or the other. She tried\n\nto counsel him but the situation did not improve. She was not\n\naware of what he wanted from her. The accused had started\n\nvisiting the home after consuming liquor. He would beat the\n\nvictim and quarrel with her. He used to abuse the victim's\n\nparents and taunt her by saying that her parents were not giving\n\nher anything. He saw the victim's mother at Kasumpti, but she\n\ndid not talk to him. The accused said that she (victim mother)\n\nhad deliberately ignored him. He gave beatings to the victim and\n\nshe had blood from the mouth. She was pregnant.\n\n22. Letter (Ext.P-3) reads that the accused had beaten the\n\nvictim on the previous night. He abused her parents and said as\n\nto why they were not dying. They did not acknowledge the\n\nmarriage between the accused and the victim. They were\n\nenjoying themselves but were not providing anything to the\n\nvictim. He was demanding ₹30,000/- for purchasing the land at\n\nMalayana. The victim was very disturbed. She was beaten daily\n\nand was apprehensive about the safety of the baby. How she\n\ncould have asked for the money? She told the accused that when\n\nshe had married him against the wishes of her parents, why he\n\n 18\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nwas demanding money from them but the accused did not listen.\n\nHe wanted ₹30,000/-. She did not know what would happen in\n\nfuture. Her fate was to get beaten daily but she was worried\n\nabout her child. She should be forgiven and taken out of this life\n\notherwise her baby would be killed.\n\n23. These letters were written when she was residing in\n\nher matrimonial home. They show the victim's feelings and\n\nwhat she was going through. They corroborate the victim's\n\ntestimony regarding the beatings given to her.\n\n24. It was submitted that the victim had not made any\n\ncomplaint to any person and this makes her testimony suspect.\n\nThis submission is not acceptable. The victim stated on oath and\n\nalso mentioned in the letters written by her that she had married\n\ncontrary to the wishes of her parents. Thus, she was unable to go\n\nto her parents because she was not sure whether she would be\n\naccepted or not. This is also apparent from her letters wherein\n\nshe had repeatedly written that she should be forgiven. There is\n\nnothing to show that the victim's parents responded to her\n\nletters and the victim remained under the impression that she\n\nhad nowhere to go. That is why she wrote in her letter (Ext.P-3)\n\nthat her fate was to get beaten every day, clearly showing that\n\n 19\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nshe had resigned to her fate. She could not have been expected to\n\nmake the complaint against her husband and lose the shelter\n\nwhich she had. She was not sure about the reaction of her parents\n\nand could not count on them to protect her. Therefore, the\n\nprosecution case cannot be doubted because the victim had not\n\nmade the complaints to any person.\n\n25. It was submitted that the learned Trial Court erred in\n\nholding that the victim had a reasonable cause for filing the\n\ncomplaint belatedly. This submission is not acceptable. As\n\nalready stated, the victim had resigned to her fate. She was\n\ngetting beaten every day as per the letters written by her,\n\nhowever, one day she and her baby girl were turned out of her\n\nmatrimonial home. Therefore, she lost the shelter she had and\n\nhad nothing more to lose, which forced her to take shelter in her\n\nparents' house and make a complaint against the petitioner. The\n\ncircumstances in which the victim had married the accused and\n\nwas residing in her matrimonial home prevented her from\n\nmaking complaints to any person or coming out of the house to\n\nsave herself.\n\n26. The victim's mother Pushpa Sharma (PW-2) stated\n\nthat she was serving in H.P. Secretariat. The victim married the\n\n 20\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\naccused on 17.02.2006 contrary to her parents' wishes. The\n\nvictim did not visit her parents' home after her marriage. She\n\nresided in her matrimonial home. The victim wrote the letters to\n\nher which were delivered to her by Davinder Lakhanpal (PW-4)\n\nand Arun Sood (PW-7). The accused demanded dowry from the\n\nvictim. He asked her (the victim) to talk to her mother. One day\n\nvictim demanded ₹30,000/- but she declined. The accused\n\nturned the victim out of her matrimonial home on 09.05.2007\n\nwith her baby girl. She stated in her cross-examination that she\n\nwas not aware of the relationship between the accused and the\n\nvictim before her marriage. The victim informed her\n\ntelephonically about the marriage. She (the victim) informed her\n\nabout the misbehaviour of the accused telephonically and by\n\nwriting the letters. The victim did not tell her about her\n\npregnancy; however, she had talked about the delivery of the\n\nchild on 20th April. She went to the hospital to see the victim and\n\nher daughter.\n\n27. Her testimony corroborates the victim's version in\n\nmaterial particulars. She has deposed about the writing of letters\n\nby the victim to her, complaining about the harassment. She\n\nstated that she had counseled the victim clearly showing that she\n\n 21\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nhad not expressed any desire to bring the victim to her parental\n\nhome. Therefore, the victim was justified in believing that she\n\nwould not be welcome in her parental home and continue to\n\nsuffer in the matrimonial home.\n\n28. Davinder Lakhanpal (PW-4) stated that he knows the\n\nvictim's father and the victim. She was residing in the house of\n\nKewal Krishan. He went to the house of Kewal Krishan in August\n\n2006 and when he met the victim, she told him that her husband\n\nwas beating her and keeping her confined to the room. The\n\naccused demanded money from her. She handed over the letter\n\n(Ext.P-2) to him to deliver to the victim's mother. He delivered\n\nthe letter to the victim's mother. He stated in his cross-\n\nexamination that the victim was his daughter's class fellow. He\n\ndid not remember the date of the delivery of the letter. He never\n\ntalked to the accused.\n\n29. There is nothing in the cross-examination of this\n\nwitness to show that he was making a false statement. He stated\n\nthat he knew the victim because of his acquaintance with the\n\nvictim's parents and his daughter being the victim's class fellow.\n\nTherefore, he was a natural person to whom the victim could\n\nconfide. The victim also handed over the letters to this witness\n\n 22\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nfor delivering it to her mother. His testimony corroborates the\n\nstatement of the victim and her mother about the delivery of the\n\nletters.\n\n30. Arun Sood (PW-7) stated that he retired from UCO\n\nBank. He knew the victim's family. The victim's father also\n\nserved in UCO Bank. The victim married the accused in February\n\ncontrary to her parents' wishes. She was residing in a rented\n\nhouse at Dev Nagar after her marriage. She met the victim in\n\nMarch 2006. He enquired about her well-being and the victim\n\nreplied that the accused used to beat her daily and confine her in\n\nthe room. She handed over a letter to him with a request to\n\ndeliver it to her mother. He delivered the letter to the victim's\n\nmother. The victim again met him at Vikasnagar Bus Stand in\n\nSeptember 2006. She handed over another letter to him with the\n\nrequest to deliver it to her mother. He delivered the letter on the\n\nsame day. The victim was residing in Hem Kunj in September\n\n2006. He was the neighbour of the victim. The accused had\n\nbeaten the victim one day and he saw her bleeding. The owner of\n\nthe house was present, who scolded the accused and asked him to\n\nvacate the room. He stated in his cross-examination that he did\n\nnot know the accused but he knew the victim. The victim's father\n\n 23\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nworked with him. He had seen the accused and the victim\n\nquarrelling once in September 2006. He denied that he was\n\nmaking a false statement because the victim's father was his\n\ncolleague.\n\n31. It was submitted that the testimony of this witness is\n\nnot reliable. He is the colleague of the victim's father. This is\n\nhardly any reason for him to depose falsely. The victim would\n\nhave confided to a known person. The fact that he knew the\n\nvictim would encourage her to deliver the letter to him with the\n\nhope that it would reach her mother instead of reaching the\n\naccused. Therefore, the testimony of this witness cannot be\n\ndiscarded because of the acquaintance with the victim's father.\n\nHis testimony corroborates the testimony of the victim and her\n\nmother regarding sending/receiving the letters.\n\n32. Meena Thakur (PW-6) stated that the accused was a\n\ntenant in her house in the year 2006. She was residing on the\n\nsame floor where the accused was residing. She was not aware of\n\nthe relationship between the accused and the victim. She did not\n\nwitness any quarrel between them. She was permitted to be\n\ncross-examined. She denied that the accused had locked the\n\nvictim in the room. She denied that the accused opened the door\n\n 24\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nafter five minutes and the victim came out of the room along\n\nwith the baby. She denied that the victim was bleeding from her\n\nmouth. She volunteered to say that she met the victim at the\n\ndoor. She enquired from the victim as to what had happened. The\n\nvictim was crying and talking to someone on the phone. She\n\nadmitted that the accused was working as a Pandit. The victim\n\nleft the home on 09.05.2007. She denied her previous statement\n\nrecorded by the police. She stated in her cross-examination by\n\nthe learned counsel for the defence that the victim had never\n\ncomplained to her about the quarrel or the beating. The accused\n\nwas happy after the birth of the baby girl. The parents of the\n\naccused visited the house and they had nice behaviour towards\n\ntheir daughter-in-law and their granddaughter.\n\n33. It was submitted that the testimony of this witness\n\ndoes not corroborate the prosecution's version regarding the\n\nbeating and the harassment and her testimony makes the\n\nprosecution case suspect. This submission cannot be accepted.\n\nThe learned Appellate Court had rightly held that the incidents of\n\ncruelty generally take place within the four corners of the house\n\nand are not witnessed by any independent person. Further, the\n\nvictim had the reason not to complain to any person and to lose\n\n 25\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nthe only shelter, she had. Therefore, the fact that the victim had\n\nnot made any complaint to her will not make her testimony\n\nsuspect. She categorically stated that the victim was crying on\n\n09.05.2007 and she was talking to someone on the phone. \nThis\n\nversion corroborates the testimony of the victim that she was\n\nbeaten on that day and was turned out of her home. Further, this\n\nwitness has been contradicted by her previous testimony and is\n\nshown to have made two inconsistent statements. Her credibility\n\nis suspect and her testimony cannot be used to discard the\n\nprosecution case. (please see \nDilo Begum vs. State of H.P.\n 2024:\n\nHHC:1519 para 24 to 34)\n\n34. Amrit Mohini (PW-10) stated that the accused resided\n\nin the building owned by her. She was not aware of the behaviour\n\nof the accused with the victim because she used to leave for her\n\njob. She was permitted to be cross-examined. She denied that she\n\nhad counselled the accused many times and when he did not pay\n\nany heed to her advice, she asked him to leave the room. She\n\nadmitted that the accused had left the room in September 2006.\n\nShe also contradicted her previous statement and she denied the\n\nsame. This witness is also shown to have made inconsistent\n\nstatements on different occasions - one before the Investigating\n\n 26\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nOfficer and another before the Court. Therefore, her credit has\n\nbeen impeached and her testimony cannot be used to discard the\n\nprosecution case.\n\n35. Asha Verma (PW-11) stated that the accused obtained\n\none room in her building for ₹1100/- per month. She was going\n\nto school to bring her children when she heard some noise from\n\nthe room of the accused. She saw that the victim was bleeding\n\nfrom her face. The victim revealed that the accused had beaten\n\nher. She returned the advance given to her by the accused and\n\nasked the accused to vacate the room. The accused vacated the\n\nroom.\n\n36. She was not cross-examined at all, which means that\n\nher testimony is accepted as correct by the accused. She\n\ncategorically stated that she had seen the victim bleeding from\n\nher face and the victim had told her about the beating given to\n\nher. Her testimony corroborates the testimony of the victim\n\nregarding the beatings given to her.\n\n37. Dinu Ram (PW-5) is the witness of the recovery of the\n\nreports of Sonography of the victim. He did not support the\n\nprosecution case, however, the same will not make any\n\ndifference.\n\n 27\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\n38. Dr Jitender Jhingta (PW-8) stated that he is running\n\nan Ultra Sound Clinic at Lakkar Bazar, Shimla. He issued a report\n\nregarding the Sonography of the victim. He stated in his cross-\n\nexamination that he had conducted the routine checkup of the\n\nvictim. He was not aware as to who had brought the victim to\n\nthe clinic.\n\n39. It was submitted that this witness has nowhere stated\n\nthat he had disclosed the sex of the foetus to the accused.\n\nHowever, this will not make much difference. The victim's\n\ntestimony regarding beating and demand for dowry is duly\n\ncorroborated by her mother, other witnesses and the letters\n\nwritten by her. Therefore, the mere fact that he has not deposed\n\nabout the disclosure of the sex of the fetus will not make the\n\nvictim's testimony suspect.\n\n40. It was submitted that the victim wanted to get rid of\n\nthe accused, as she wanted to marry someone else and she filed a\n\nfalse complaint to achieve this purpose. This submission is not\n\nacceptable. The victim married the accused contrary to the\n\nwishes of her parents, which shows the confidence reposed by\n\nher in the accused. She had left her parents' home for the\n\naccused and she had no reason to get rid of the accused. The\n\n 28\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\naccused did not assign any reason in his statement recorded\n\nunder \nSection 313\n of Cr.P.C. as to why the victim wanted to get rid\n\nof him. The fact that the victim had married the accused against\n\nthe wishes of her parents, resided with him and delivered his\n\nbaby would make it difficult to believe that the victim would have\n\nthought of dumping him and marrying someone without any\n\nreason.\n\n41. The testimony of the victim is duly corroborated by\n\nthe letters written by her and the testimony of other witnesses;\n\ntherefore, both the learned Courts below had rightly accepted the\n\nsame and had rightly held that the prosecution case was duly\n\nproved beyond reasonable doubt against the accused for the\n\ncommission of an offence punishable under \nSection 498-A\n of\n\nIPC.\n\n42. The learned Trial Court had sentenced the accused to\n\nundergo simple imprisonment for one year, pay a fine of\n\n₹5000/- and in default of payment of the fine to further undergo\n\nsimple imprisonment for three months. This is not excessive. A\n\nyoung girl left her parental home to reside with the accused. The\n\naccused gave her beatings and abused her. He asked her to bring\n\na dowry. The accused betrayed the trust of the victim. Hence, in\n\n 29\n\n 2025:HHC:9999\n\nthese circumstances, the punishment of one year and a fine of\n\n₹5000/- is not excessive.\n\n43. No other point was urged.\n\n44. In view of the above, the present revision fails and the\n\nsame is dismissed.\n\n45. The present petition stands disposed of in the\n\naforesaid terms along with pending miscellaneous\n\napplication(s), if any.\n\n (Rakesh Kainthla)\n Judge\n 10th April, 2025\n (ravinder)",
