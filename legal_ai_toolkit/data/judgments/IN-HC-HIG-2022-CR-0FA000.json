The petitioner has been supplied the grounds for detention\nand according to which there would be a possibility of creating a\ndispute in relation to political and communal matters after release\nfrom jail on bail. Deputy Commissioner of Police Zone No.3,\nIndore vide letter dated 02.05.2022 requested District Magistrate,\nIndore for initiating detention proceedings against the petitioner on\naccount of four criminal cases registered against him. The details\nare as under:-\n\nSl. Crime Act Court's Challan Fau. M. No. Decision Police\nNo. No. Name No. Station\n1 411/2016 354-323-294- District 389/2016 168498/2016 Pending Vijay\n506-34 of\nIPC\nCourt Dtd.

Along with the aforesaid letter, the Deputy Commissioner of\nPolice has given the list of five witnesses to be examined in this\nmatter against the petitioner. After drawing proceedings under\n\nsection 3\nof the National Security Act,1980 the District Magistrate\nhas passed an order of detention without prescribing the period of\ndetention. However, the petitioner has been given the right to\nsubmit a representation before the District Magistrate, Secretary\nDepartment of Home Govt. of India New Delhi, Secretary Home\nDepartment Govt. of M.P. Bhopal and Advisory Board.\n\n3. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order the petitioner has\napproached this court by way of a writ petition challenging the\ndetention order inter alia on the ground that the provisions of\n\nsection 3(2)\nof the National Security Act,1980 should be exercised\nin a very cautious manner and after granting the fair opportunity to\nthe aggrieved person. The petitioner has not been convicted in any\n\n- : 3 :-\n\nof the criminal cases. Out of four cases, two cases have been\nregistered recently with the intention to initiate proceedings under\n\nNational Security Act\nagainst him. The petitioner is the only earning\nmember in the family and at the time of detention he was already in\njail, therefore, there was no need to pass an order of detention in the\napprehension of disturbance of public order. It is further submitted\nthat the Constitution of India guarantees the right to live with\ndignity and freedom which has been taken away by the respondent\nby passing the impugned order with an ulterior motive. Hence the\norder is liable to be set aside.\n\n4. The respondents have filed the reply by submitting that\npursuant to the detention order the detenu has been taken into the\ncustody and thereafter the order of detention was served upon him\nalong with the order of detention along with grounds of detention.\nThe date of arrest was duly communicated to the relatives of the\npetitioner. He has been informed about his right to present against\nthe order of detention before the advisory board. It is further\nsubmitted that intimation with regard to the detention of the\npetitioner has been forwarded to the Central Government well\nwithin time. It is further submitted that this petitioner was actively\nindulged in criminal activities prejudicial to the public order and\npublic safety therefore, the learned District Magistrate well within\nhis power has rightly passed the order under\nsection 3(2)\nof the\nNational Security Act,1980. To support the impugned order the\nGovernment has placed reliance on the judgments passed by the\nApex Court in the case of Attorney General of India V/s Amritlal\nPrajivandas (1994) 5 SCC 54, in case of Ashok Kumar Vs. Delhi\nAdministration (1982) 2 SCC 402, in case of Bharat Petroleum\nCorporation Ltd. Vs. Varimani (2004) 8 SCC 579, in case of C.\nRonald Vs. UT Andaman & Nicobar Islands (2011) 12 SCC 428,\nin case of Deepak Bajaj Vs. State of Maharashtra (2008) 16 SCC\n\n- : 4 :-\n\n14 and prays for dismissal of the writ petition.\n\n5. Shri Anshuman Shrivastava, learned counsel for the\npetitioner has placed reliance on the judgment passed by the Apex\nCourt in the case of\nArun Ghosh Vs. State of West Bengal\nreported\nin 1970 (1) SCC 98 in which distinction has been drawn between\npublic order and law and order. It has been held that disturbance of\npublic order is to be distinguished from the act directed against\nindividuals who do not disturb society to the extent of causing a\ngeneral disturbance of public tranquillity. It is further submitted that\nall the criminal cases registered against the petitioner are not to the\nnature that which can be termed as a disturbance of the public order.\n\nHe has also placed reliance on the judgment passed by the Apex\nCourt in the case of\nYumman Ongli Lembi Leima Vs. State of\nManipur and others\nreported in 2012 (2) SCC 176 where the\npetitioner therein was arrested on mere apprehension that he would\nlikely be released on bail as a ground of his detention. The Apex\nCourt has held that the personal liberty of the individual is the most\nprecious and priced right guaranteed under the constitution in part\nthree thereof. The State has been granted the power to curb such\nrights under the criminal laws and also under the laws of preventive\ndetention which are required to be exercised with due caution as\nwell as upon the proper appreciation of the facts.\n\nShri Anshuman\nShrivastava has further placed reliance on a judgment passed by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in the case of\nRavi Tiwari and others\nVs. Union of India and Others\nreported in 2003 (3) MPLJ 372 in\nwhich the order of detention has been set aside which was not based\nupon the proper application of mind, relevant document etc.\n\n6. Learned Government Advocate for the State has argued in\nsupport of the detention order and prays for dismissal of the writ\npetition. He has placed reliance over the judgment passed by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in case of Smt. Kamini Yadav Vs.\n\n- : 5 :-\n\nState of M.P. & others in writ petition No.25986/2018. It is further\nsubmitted that the petition is premature as the order of the detention\nhas not been approved by the advisory board and confirmed by the\nState Government. It is further submitted that even if the period of\ndetention has not been prescribed in the detention order by virtue of\n\nsection 13\nof the National Security Act,1980 it shall not be more\nthan 12 months from the date of detention. It is further submitted\nthat during the arrest also order of detention can be passed in the\npossibility of disturbing the public order after release on bail. The\npetitioner has duly communicated the order of detention along with\nthe grounds. The petitioner has the right to submit a representation\nchallenging the order of detention hence the petition is liable to be\ndismissed.\n\nWe have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n7. Vide letter dated 05.02.2022 the Deputy Commissioner of\nPolice Zone No.3 Indore has requested the District Magistrate for\ninitiating the proceedings of detention against the petitioner by\nsupplying the list of four criminal cases registered against him.\nThere are as many as four criminal cases registered against him.\nThe details are as under:-\n\nSl. Crime Act Court's Challan Fau. M. No. Decision Police\nNo. No. Name No. Station\n1 411/2016 354-323-294- District 389/2016 168498/2016 Pending Vijay\n506-34 of\nIPC\nCourt Dtd. Dtd. before Nagar\n17.09.2016 31.12.2016 Court\n2 177/2018 307-323-294- District 192/2018 33327/2018 Pending Tukoganj\n506-34 of\nIPC\nCourt Dtd. Dtd. before\n26.07.2018 28.07.2018 Court\n3 244/2022 323-294-506- District - - Under Tukoganj\n34 of\nIPC\nCourt investiga\ntion\n4 247/2022 25 of Arms District - - Under Tukoganj\nAct Court investiga\ntion\n\n8. However, in none of the cases, the appellant has been\nconvicted so far. One of the offences has been taken very seriously\nby the Deputy Commissioner of Police as well as the Collector\n\n- : 6 :-\n\nwhich took place in the year 2016 and for which he was facing trial\nunder\nsection 354\nof the IPC but the same has not been concluded\nso far. Another case was registered in the year 2018 under\nsections\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC in which also he was arrested\nand released on bail. Two cases have been registered on 30.04.2022\nfor the offence under\nsections 307\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the IPC\nand\nsection 25\nof the Arms Act. Learned counsel for the petitioner\nhas submitted that the petitioner was arrested and produced before\nthe magistrate and the magistrate has raised serious objection as to\nwhy he has been detained when all the offences are bailable in\nnature. The applicant was released and immediately he was arrested\nunder\nsection 151\nof the IPC and sent to jail. The learned magistrate\nin the impugned order has noted that at present the petitioner is in\njail but there is a strong possibility of he being released on bail and\nafter release, he may threaten the general public and women and\ncreates a dispute relating to political and communal matters. It is\nclear from the grounds of detention that the applicant has been\ndirected to be detained merely on surmises and speculation. Under\n\nsection 3(2)\nof the National Security Act,1980 the Central\nGovernment and the State Government may if satisfied with respect\nto any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in a\nprejudicial and to maintaining a public order make an order\ndirecting such person be detained, therefore, the order\nsection 3(2)\n\nof the National Security Act,1980 is liable to be passed in order to\nprevent any person if the authorities are satisfied that he may act in\na manner prejudicial to maintenance of public order. The Apex\ncourt in the case of\nArun Ghosh\n(supra) has given a formula that\none case can be distinguished from another case. A question to ask\nis, does it lead to disturbance of the current of life of the community\nto amount to a disturbance of the public order or does it affect\nmerely an individual leaving the tranquillity of the society\n\n- : 7 :-\n\nundisturbed? This question has to be faced in every case on facts.\nThere is no formula by which one case can be distinguished from\nanother. The relevant extract reads as under:-\n\n\"3. The submission of the counsel is that these are stray\nacts directed against individuals and are not subversive of\npublic order and therefore the detention on the ostensible\nground of preventing him from acting in a manner\nprejudicial to public order was not justified.\nIn support of\nthis submission reference is made to three cases of this\nCourt:\nDr. Ram Manohar Lohia v. State of Bihar\n;\nPushkar\nMukherjee and Ors. v. State of West Bengal\nand\nShyamal\nChakraborty v. The Commissioner of Police, Calcuta and\nAnr.\n.\n\nIn\nDr. Ram Manohar Lohia\n's case this Court pointed\nout the difference between maintenance of law and order\nand its disturbance and the maintenance of public order\nand its disturbance. Public order was said to embrace more\nof the community than law and order. Public order is the\neven tempo of the life of the community taking the country\nas a whole or even a specified locality. Disturbance of\npublic order is to be distinguished, from acts directed\nagainst individuals which do not disturb the society to the\nextent of causing a general disturbance of public\ntranquillity. It is the degree of disturbance and its effect\nupon the life of the community in a locality which\ndetermines whether the disturbance amounts only to a\nbreach of law and order. Take for instance, a man stabs\nanother. People may be shocked and even disturbed, but the\nlife of the community keeps moving at an even tempo,\nhowever much one may dislike the act. Take another case of\na town where there is communal tension. A man stabs a\nmember of the other community. This is an act of a very\ndifferent sort. Its implications are deeper and it affects the\neven tempo of life and public order is jeopardized because\nthe repercussions of the act embrace large Sections of the\ncommunity and incite them to make further breaches of the\nlaw and order and to subvert the public order. An act by\nitself is not determinant of its own gravity. In its quality it\nmay not differ from another but in its potentiality it may be\nvery different. Take the case of assault on girls. A guest at a\nhotel may kiss or make advances to half a dozen chamber\nmaids. He may annoy them and also the management but he\ndoes not cause disturbance of public order. He may even\nhave a fracas with the friends of one of the girls but even\nthen it would be a case of breach of law and order only.\n\nTake another case of a man who molests women in lonely\nplaces. As a result of his activities girls going to colleges\nand schools are in constant danger and fear. Women going\nfor their ordinary business are afraid of being waylaid and\nassaulted. The activity of this man in its essential quality is\nnot different from the act of the other man but in its\n\n- : 8 :-\n\npotentiality and in its affect upon the public tranquillity\nthere is a vast difference. The act of the man who molests\nthe girls in lonely places causes a disturbance in the even\ntempo of living which is the first requirement of public\norder. He disturbs the society and the community. His act\nmakes all the women apprehensive of their honour and he\ncan be said to be causing disturbance of public order and\nnot merely committing individual actions which may be\ntaken note of by the criminal prosecution agencies. It means\ntherefore that the question whether a man has only\ncommitted a breach of law and order or has acted in a\nmanner likely to cause a disturbance of the public order is a\nquestion of degree and the extent of the reach of the act\nupon the society. The French distinguish law and order and\npublic order by designating the latter as order publique.\nThe latter expression has been recognised as meaning\nsomething more than ordinary maintenance of law and\norder. Justice Ramaswami in Writ Petition No. 179 of 1968\ndrew a line of demarcation between the serious and\naggravated forms of breaches of public order which affect\nthe community or endanger the public interest at large from\nminor breaches of peace which do not affect the public at\nlarge. He drew an analogy between public and private\ncrimes. The analogy is useful but not to be pushed too far. A\nlarge number of acts directed against persons or\nindividuals may total up into a breach of public order. In\nDr. Ram Manohar Lohia's(1) case examples were given by\nSarkar, and Hidayatullah, JJ. They show how similar acts\nin different contexts affect differently law and order on the\none hand and public order on the other. It is always a\nquestion of degree of the harm and its effect upon the\ncommunity. The question to ask is: Does it lead to\ndisturbance of the current of life of the community so as to\namount to a disturbance of the public order or does it affect\nmerely an individual leaving the tranquillity of the society\nundisturbed? This question has to be faced in every case on\nfacts. There is no formula by which one case can be\ndistinguished from another.\n\n4. In the present case the acts of the petitioner affected the\nfamily of Phanindra C. Das and also two other individuals\nwho were assaulted. The case is distinguishable from Writ\nPetition No. 102 of 1969 where three instances of rioting\narmed with lathis, iron rods and acid bulbs etc. were held\nsufficient to disturb the even tempo of public life in that\nlocality and were treated as disturbance of public order. On\nthe other hand in Writ Petition No. 179 of 1968 assaults on\nfour persons A, B, C and D and throwing a cracker into a\npolice wireless van were not held to add up to the\ndisturbance of public order. They were treated as separate\nacts which affected individuals but did not affect the\ncommunity at large.\n\n5. In the present case all acts of molestation were\n\n- : 9 :-\n\ndirected against the family of Phanindra C. Das and were\nnot directed against women in general from the locality.\nAssaults also were on individuals. The conduct may be\nreprehensible but it does not add up to the situation where it\nmay be said that the community at large was being\ndisturbed or in other words there was a breach of public\norder or likelihood of a breach of public order. The case\nfalls within the dictum of Justice Ramaswami and the\ndistinction made in\nDr. Ram Manohar Lohia\n's case.\"\n\n9. All the criminal cases against the petitioner are not of such\nnature that it has ever affected or disturbed the society or the\ncommunity which has further caused disturbance to the public order\nThe court has held that it is not justified to detain a person as he is\nlikely to be released on bail. In the present case, a criminal case\nunder\nsection 354\nof the IPC was registered in the year 2016 and the\ndetention order has been passed after 6 years after the said incident.\nHence, there is no live link between the earlier incidence and the\nincidence in respect of which the detention order had been passed.\nThe relevant paragraphs of Yumman Ongbi Lembi leima (supra) is\nreproduced below:-\n\n\"23. Having carefully considered the submissions made on\nbehalf of respective parties, we are inclined to hold that the\nextra-ordinary powers of detaining an individual in\ncontravention of the provisions of\nArticle 22(2)\nof the\nConstitution was not warranted in the instant case, where the\ngrounds of detention do not disclose any material which was\nbefore the detaining authority, other than the fact that there\nwas every likelihood of Yumman Somendro being released on\nbail in connection with the cases in respect of which he had\nbeen arrested, to support the order of detention.\n\n24.\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution enjoins that:\n\n\"21. Protection of life and personal liberty- No\nperson shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except,\naccording to procedure established by law.\n\nIn the instant case, although the power is vested with\nthe concerned authorities, unless the same are invoked and\nimplemented in a justifiable manner, such action of the\ndetaining authority cannot be sustained, inasmuch as, such a\ndetention order is an exception to the provisions of\nArticles 21\n\nand\n22(2)\nof the Constitution.\n\n25. When the Courts thought it fit to release the Appellant's\nhusband on bail in connection with the cases in respect of\nwhich he had been arrested, the mere apprehension that he\nwas likely to be released on bail as a ground of his detention,\nis not justified.\n\n- : 10 :-\n\n26. In addition to the above, the FIRs in respect of which the\nAppellant's husband had been arrested relate to the years\n1994, 1995 and 1998 respectively, whereas the order of\ndetention was passed against him on 31st January, 2011,\nalmost 12 years after the last FIR No.190(5)98 IPS under\n\nSection 13\nof the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. There\nis no live link between the earlier incidents and the incident in\nrespect of which the detention order had been passed.\n\n27. As has been observed in various cases of similar nature\nby this Court, the personal liberty of an individual is the most\nprecious and prized right guaranteed under the Constitution\nin Part III thereof. The State has been granted the power to\ncurb such rights under criminal laws as also under the laws\nof preventive detention, which, therefore, are required to be\nexercised with due caution as well as upon a proper\nappreciation of the facts as to whether such acts are in any\nway prejudicial to the interest and the security of the State\nand its citizens, or seek to disturb public law and order,\nwarranting the issuance of such an order. An individual\nincident of an offence under the\nIndian Penal Code\n, however\nheinous, is insufficient to make out a case for issuance of an\norder of preventive detention.\n\n10.\nUnder the National Security Act\n, a person is liable to be\ndetained if there is an apprehension that with a view to preventing\nhim from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the\nState for maintenance of public order. It means his free movement\nin society is liable to be curbed out by passing the order of\ndetention. But in the present case, the petitioner was already under\ncustody and the order of detention has been passed only on the basis\nof the strong possibility that he would be released on bail and\nthereafter would repeat the crime. Even in the case of which has\nbeen strongly relied on by the Govt. Advocate i.e. Kamini Yadav\n(Supra) in similar facts and circumstances the order of the detention\nhas been quashed as the detenu was already in custody at the time of\npassing of the detention order. The relevant extract reads as under:-\n\n\"16. Therefore it is the settled position of law that\nthe authorities are not precluded from passing an order of\ndetention when the person concerned is in jail, but while\npassing the order of detention, they are required to apply\ntheir mind to the fact that the person concerned is already\nin jail and there are compelling reasons justifying such\ndetention despite the fact that the detenu was already in\ndetention and the compelling reasons implies that there\n\n- : 11 :-\n\nmust be cogent material before the Detaining Authority on\nthe basis of which it may be satisfied that the detenu is\nlikely to be released from custody in the near future or\ntaking into account the nature of the antecedent activities\nof the detenu, it is likely that after his release from custody\nhe would indulge in prejudicial activities and it is\nnecessary to detain him in order to prevent him from\nengaging in such activities.\n\n17. Whether the aforesaid requirements are\nfulfilled in this case or not ? In this regard the respondents\ntried to convenience the Court that the detaining authority\nwas aware of the fact that the accused is already in jail.\n\nHe draws our attention towards the report submitted by\nthe Superintendent of Police and argued that, in the\nreport, it was mentioned that the detenu has been arrested\nin Crime No.197/2018 and has been sent to the judicial\ncustody. It was also mentioned that on 30.08.2018 the\ndetenu was arrested in connection with Crime\nNo.248/2018 and sent to the judicial custody. As per\nrespondent the detenu was arrested in connection with\nCrime No.248/2018 and 197/2018 and was confined in\ncustody. But the aforesaid fact is not reflected from the\norder passed by the detaining authority. In the order dated\n11.10.2018, it is mentioned that :-\n\n\"it is necessary to detain him under Sub Section\n(2) of\nSection 3\nof the National Security Act.\n\n1980\". ¼jk\"Vªh; lqj{kk vf/kfu;e 1980 dh /kkjk 3 dh\nmi/kkjk ¼2½ ds v/khu fu:) fd;k tkuk vko';d gS ½.\nIn para No.2, it is mentioned that:-\n\n\"may be so detained and kept in Netaji Subhash\nChandra Bose Central Jail, Jabalpur\" (dks fu:)\nfd;k tkdj dsUnzh; tsy tcyiqj esa j[kk tkos).\nIn para No.3 of the order, it is mentioned that:-\n\n\"This order will be valid for a period of upcoming\n03 (three) months from the date of actual\ndetention\" (;g vkns'k vukosnd dks fu:) fd;s tkus\ndh okLrfod frfFk ls vkxkeh 03 ¼rhu½ ekg dh vof/k ds\nfy;s cS/k gksxk).\n\n18. The aforesaid quoted portion of the order shows\nthat the detaining authority did not took the notice of the\nfact that the detenu is already in custody. We have\nminutely perused the impugned order dated 11.10.2018\npassed by District Magistrate. In the said impugned order,\nit is not mention that the accused was in jail at the time of\npassing of the said order. It is not reflected from the said\norder that the detaining authority was aware of the fact\nthat the accused was in jail at the time of passing of the\nsaid order. No any such material has been produced\nbefore this Court to establish such facts. Therefore, the\nimpugned order clearly indicates the non application of\nmind by the detaining authority in respect of the\npossibility of the release of the Petitioner. Since, the\n\n- : 12 :-\n\ndetaining authority was not made aware of the fact that\nthe accused was in custody in relation to the investigation\nin two criminal cases, therefore, the detaining authority\nhad no occasion to apply his mind in respect of possibility\nof the accused being released on bail and the probability\nof his involvement in such activities after release on bail.\nIt is not clear from the order passed by the detaining\nauthority that it was in the notice of the authority that the\ndetenu was already in jail since 30.08.2018 otherwise the\nauthority will not mention in para-3 that \"this order will\nbe valid for a period of upcoming 03 (three) months from\nthe date of actual detention\". Before about 40 days back,\nthe detenu was in custody, therefore, the satisfaction of the\nauthority was required and should be mentioned in the\norder passed, but the authority passed the order in\nmechanical way by using a set proforma. Order did not\nfulfill the requirement of the law and the principle laid\ndown by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the High Court.\n\n11. Therefore, in view of the above, the order of detention dated\n02.05.2022 is unsustainable and is accordingly quashed. The Writ\nPetition is allowed with the cost of Rs. 10,000.00 payable to the\npetitioner.\n\n12.
