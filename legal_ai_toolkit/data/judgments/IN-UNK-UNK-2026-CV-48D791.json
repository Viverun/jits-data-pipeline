The facts as noted from the record are, a Petrochemical Complex\nconsisting of several interdependent units viz. Dual Fee Cracker Units\n('DFCU', for short), the Polyethylene Unit ('PE unit', for short) the\nPolypropylene Unit ('PP unit', for short), a Pyrolysis Gasoline Hydrogenation\nUnit, a Benzene Extraction Unit, Butadiene Extraction Unit and other units\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 2\n for manufacturing variety of petrochemical and allied products has come up at\nDehaj.\n\n3. For the purpose of construction and setting up of the PE unit and the PP\nunit, the respondent selected the petitioners as the successful bidder. Pursuant\nthereto, the parties herein entered into two contracts both dated September 02,\n2011 for the PE unit and the PP unit respectively.\n\n4. Under the contracts, the petitioners were required to construct, develop\nand successfully commissioned a PE unit and PP unit within 28 months of the\nexecution of the contract.\n\n5. As per Clause 3.3 of General Conditions of Contract ('GCC', for short),\nthe petitioners were required to furnish performance bank guarantees,\nguaranteeing the execution and performance of the works under the contracts.\n\n6. In terms of Clause 3.8 of the GCC, the petitioners were also required to\nfurnish advance bank guarantee to secure the mobilization advance paid by\nthe respondent to the petitioners for execution of the contracts. In furtherance\nof the above, the petitioners furnished bank guarantees to the respondent as\nmentioned in the prayer clause. It may be stated here that the bank guarantees\nwere reduced from 10% to 5% of the contract value.\n\n7. The scheduled date of completion of commissioning of both the units\nwas on or before October 02, 2013. There is no dispute that the actual date of\ncommissioning of the units was April 14, 2017 (in respect of PE unit) and\nFebruary 12, 2017 (in respect of PP unit).\n\n8. It is averred by the respondent that the contract included several stages,\nviz construction and commissioning of the PE unit and the PP unit, to carry\nout Performance Guarantee Test Runs ('PGTR', for short), post\ncommissioning services for six months, providing as built drawings, supply of\ntest reports, fulfilling of all warranty obligations.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 3\n\n 9. It is also averred by the respondent that the contracts also contemplated\nthat the performance of the contracts would be completed only upon issuance\nof Certificate of Completion and Acceptance of Works (Clause 5.10 of GCC)\nand Discharge Certificate (Clause 5.14). It is averred by respondent that even\nbefore achieving the mechanical completion, pre-commissioning and\ncommissioning of the project on May 18, 2015, the petitioners issued\narbitration notices under the relevant provisions of the contracts for several\nreliefs. However, the petitioners did not proceed with the arbitration\nproceedings, or sought appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator until it\nobtained commissioning certificate for the PP and PE units in 2017.\n\n10. It is the conceded case of the parties that disputes and differences arose\nbetween them. The primary claim of the petitioners was for damages on\naccount of delay on the part of the respondent in the completion and\ncommissioning of the project.\n\n11. The respondent had also filed counter claims contending it is entitled to\nliquidated damages for the delay in commissioning of both PE and PP units\nattributable to the petitioners and also for the losses and damages incurred by\nthe respondent on account of defects and damages discovered in the PE unit.\nIt is the case of the respondent in paragraph 30 of its counter-affidavit that the\npetitioners were in breach of their obligation to complete the PGTR of the\nrespective units.\n\n12. It is noted that the arbitration proceedings were finally heard between\nSeptember 15, 2017 to September 18, 2017. At the time of the culmination of\nproceedings, the bank guarantees were alive. It appears, that as the validity of\nsome of the bank guarantees were expiring on December 14, 2019, the\nrespondent addressed e-mails dated December 06, 2019 to the petitioners. It\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 4\n also appears, that the petitioners extended the validity of all the five bank\nguarantees.\n\n13. On January 06, 2020, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered its award\n('Award', hereinafter). It is the case of the petitioners, that the majority\nawarded an amount of Rs.162 Crores to them and dismissed the respondent's\ncounter-claim in its entirety. Suffice would it be to state, application for\nclarifications were filed on March 06, 2020. The respondent filed the petition\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act challenging the impugned Award. On March 07,\n2020, the respondent wrote an e-mail to the petitioners asking them to extend\nthe validity of the bank guarantees on the ground that the disputes between the\nparties about the obligation under the contracts are pending before the Court\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act.\n\n14. It is the case of the respondent that as the petitioners failed to extend\nthe bank guarantees, that were expiring, the respondent, invoked the bank\nguarantees by e-mails dated March 09, 2020 and March 10, 2020. Aggrieved\nby the invocation of the bank guarantees, the petitioners filed\nOMP(I)(COMM) 73/2020 before this Court. The petition was disposed of by\nthis Court on March 13, 2020. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the order reads as\nunder:-\n\n \"5. Noting the submissions, this court deem it appropriate to dispose\n of the petition by directing the petitioners to extend the validity of the\n aforesaid three bank guarantees for a period of one month within which\n time, the respondent shall get their petition under \nSection 34\n listed and\n seek appropriate orders.\n\n 6. A question arose, as to who shall bear the expenses for extending the\n validity of the three bank guarantees. Mr. Nayar states, as similar\n claim(s) of the petitioners was also allowed in favour of the petitioner\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 5\n by the Arbitral Tribunal it should be the respondent who shall bear the\n cost.\"\n\n15. Pursuant thereto, the petitioners filed an application in\nOMP(I)(COMM) 73/2020 seeking clarification of order dated March 13,\n2020. The application for clarification was dismissed stating that the said\norder is clear. The petitioners filed an appeal challenging the orders dated\nFebruary 13, 2020 and March 17, 2020 before the Division Bench, being\nFAO(OS)(COMM) 58/2020. It appears, the Division Bench clarified that\neven though the petitioners have not extended the bank guarantee provided by\nIDBI Bank, in view of the fact that the claim expiry period of the said bank\nguarantee was expiring only in December 2020, the respondent is suitably\nprotected. The appeal was accordingly disposed of.\n\n16. The \nSection 34\n petition of the respondent herein being OMP(COMM)\n424/2020, was listed for hearing on March 23, 2020, when this Court passed\nthe following order: -\n\n \"1. This is a petition challenging the Award dated January 06, 2020, as\n corrected on February 11, 2020.\n\n 2. The award is by majority members. Mr. Dewan challenges the award\n on various grounds and presses for the interim relief. He also, on\n instructions, states that subject to the awarded amounts being paid by\n the petitioner to the respondents and simultaneously, the respondents\n furnishing bank guarantee(s) for the said amounts, the operation of the\n impugned award be stayed.\n\n 3. This submission of Mr. Dewan is acceptable to Mr. Sethi, on\n instructions.\n\n 4. Accordingly, the petitioner shall pay to the respondents, the amounts\n as per the award in five days. The respondents shall simultaneously, on\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 6\n receipt of the amounts, furnish to the petitioner bank guarantee(s) for\n the amounts received. The bank guarantee(s) shall be kept alive till\n further orders of this Court. On such payment / receipt of the amounts,\n the operation of the impugned award dated January 06, 2020 as\n corrected on February 11, 2020 shall remain stayed.\n\n 5. The payment to be made by the petitioner to the respondents, in\n terms of this order shall be subject to the outcome of this petition.\n\n 6. Parties to file their written submission before the next date of\n hearing with advance copy to the other side.\n\n 7. Renotify on 24th September, 2020.\n\n Dasti.\"\n\n17. It is a conceded position, that the parties have implemented the order\ndated March 23, 2020 by discharging each other's obligation by April 21,\n2020. As the validity of the bank guarantees was expiring, the respondent on\nApril 05, 2020 wrote a letter to the petitioners and called upon them to extend\nthe validity of the bank guarantees. The said letter was responded to by the\npetitioners by stating (i) the order dated March 13, 2020 only directed\nextension of bank guarantees (a) 464840; (b) DLG211/11; (c)\n1101261BGP00064; (ii) the bank guarantees were to be extended for a period\nof one month to enable the respondent obtain orders in their petition under\n\nSection 34\n; (iii) the direction regarding extension of bank guarantee issued by\nIDBI stood modified vide order dated March 19, 2020 of the Division Bench,\ntherefore there is no requirement to extend the bank guarantee; (iv) the\nrespondent had failed to obtain any orders regarding extension of bank\nguarantees furnished by the petitioners in its petition under \nSection 34\n of the\nAct.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 7\n\n 18. In response to the aforesaid letter of the petitioners, the respondent vide\nits letter dated April 07, 2020, decided to invoke the bank guarantees on\nfailure on the part of the petitioners to extend the same on or before April 09,\n2020. The petitioners responded to the aforesaid letter of the respondent vide\nletter dated April 09, 2020, which was also responded to by the respondent on\nApril 10, 2020. In any case, the petitioners filed this petition on April 12,\n2020. The matter was initially listed on April 15, 2020 when this Court\npassed the following order:-\n\n \"1. This petition has been taken up by video conferencing in view of the\n emergent nature of the controversy involved, consequent to listing\n thereof having been allowed by the Registry.\n\n 2. The petitioners, in this petition under \nSection 9\n of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as \" the Act\"), seeks an\n order restraining the respondent from invoking or encashing the\n following Performance Bank Guarantees, furnished by the petitioner\n during the course of execution of the work contract with the\n respondent, as well as a direction to the effect that the petitioner would\n not be required to keep these bank guarantees alive any further.\n\n 3. Issue notice to the respondent, returnable on 27th May, 2020.\n Counter-affidavit by way of response to the OMP, if any, be filed within\n two weeks with advance copy to the petitioner who may file rejoinder\n thereto, if so advised, within one week thereafter.\n\n 4. Notice is accepted by Mr. K Sasiprabhu, learned Counsel on behalf\n of Respondent.\n\n 5. Though the matter was heard at considerable length, learned Senior\n counsel for the parties, on instructions, submit that they are agreeable\n to an ad interim arrangement, whereby and whereunder the petitioner\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 8\n would keep the Performance Bank Guarantees at serial nos. 1, 2, 3 and\n 4 in the tabular statement contained in the prayer clause in the OMP\n alive, till the next date of hearing, and the respondent would not take\n take any further steps, towards invocation of the said Bank Guarantees,\n till the next date of hearing, be passed. Learned Senior Counsel is\n agreeable, on these terms, to the invocation of the said Bank\n Guarantees remaining in abeyance, till the next date of hearing.\n Charges, for keeping the said Bank Guarantees alive till the date next\n of hearing, would continue as per the terms set out in the order dated\n 13th March, 2020 of the learned Single Judge in O.M.P. (I) (Comm)\n 73/2020.\n\n 6. The said submissions are noted, and the parties shall remain bound\n thereby.\"\n\nSubmissions:\n\n19. Mr. Ritin Rai, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners would submit\nthat, the return of the bank guarantees sought for by the petitioners in this\npetition are those, which the petitioners provided to the respondent during the\nperformance of the two contracts for the construction of PE unit and PP unit at\na Petrochemical complex at Dehaj. The petitioners admittedly performed the\ncontracts as far back as in 2017, and the respondent issued two separate\nCommissioning Certificates dated February 15, 2017 and April 14, 2017. It is\na conceded case of the respondent as well that the plants were commissioned\nin 2017 and have achieved 100% capacity utilization. That apart, an arbitral\nAward directing the respondent to pay a sum of Rs. 201 Crores to the\npetitioners has already been passed. That apart, all the counter claims of the\nrespondent as regards the performance of the contract have been rejected and\nthe respondent has no live and subsisting claim.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 9\n\n 20. According to Mr. Rai, the short issue that arises for consideration, in\nthis petition is, whether the respondent who has lost the arbitral proceedings\nand had all its counter claims in relation to the performance of the contract\nrejected by the Arbitral Tribunal, can seek extension of the bank guarantees\nfurnished by the petitioners for the performance of the contracts pending\nadjudication of the respondent's petition under \nSection 34\n of the Act\nchallenging the Award.\n\n21. According to Mr. Rai, this issue is no longer res-integra and has been\nsettled by this Court, inasmuch as a losing party in an arbitration cannot seek\nan extension of the contractual Bank Guarantees or invoke them once it has\nsuffered an Award. Such an extension or pay demand is not only barred\nunder \nSection 9\n of the Act but also under \nSection 34\n read with \nSection 36\n of\nthe Act. In this regard, he had relied upon the judgments of this Court in the\ncase of Nussli Switzerland Ltd. vs. Organizing Committee FAO(OS)\n121/2014 and Bombay High Court in Dirk India Private Limited vs. MSEGC\n(2013) 7 Bom. CR 493. \nFor the same proposition, he relied upon a judgment\nwherein Nussli (supra) was followed that is \nSinghania Horizons vs. HRC\nEngineers Estates (P) Ltd.\n 2016 (1) HCC (Delhi) 59.\n\n22. It was the submission of Mr. Rai, when a losing party cannot seek an\norder in \nSection 9\n petition, it cannot seek such an order in \nSection 34\n petition.\n[Ref. ONGC vs. Consortium of SimeDarby Engineering Sdn. Bhd. And\nanother 2018 SCC OnLine Bom 6034]. Mr. Rai stated under similar\ncircumstances, this Court, during the pendency of petitions under \nSection 34\n\nof the Act directed the return of bank guarantees in a petition filed under\n\nSection 9\n of the Act in the case of Mukti Credits Pvt. Ltd. vs. Indra Prastha\nPower Generation Co. Ltd., OMP(I) (COMM) 113/2019. He also stated that\nthe respondent demanded, the bank guarantees be extended only on the\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 10\n ground of purported challenge to the final Award. According to him, the\nrespondent in its e-mail dated March 07, 2020 did not aver that the extension\nis being sought in respect of an additional claim the respondent had against\nthe petitioners. It is only later on, on April 10, 2020, the respondent has taken\na stand that the bank guarantees are required to be extended as the petitioners\nfailed to perform its obligation under the contracts. That apart, the subsequent\ninvocation of the bank guarantees is egregious case of fraudulent invocation.\n\n23. That apart, it was his submission that the Court vide order dated\nMarch 13, 2020, had directed the petitioners to extend the bank guarantees by\na period of only one month, within which time, the respondent was to satisfy\nthe condition of securing 'appropriate order' in its \nSection 34\n petition, which\nthey failed to secure. He stated, no positive direction for extension of bank\nguarantees could have been sought in a petition under \nSection 34\n of the Act.\nIn fact, it was his submission that the stay application does not refer at all to\nthe subject bank guarantees. He qualifies his submission by stating that a\npetition under \nSection 34\n of the Act is only for setting aside an arbitral Award\non the limited grounds provided under \nSection 34\n of the Act. Therefore, at\nthe highest, even accepting the respondent's position for the sake of argument,\nthe final Award may be set aside, even then the respondent's counter claims\ncannot be allowed in \nSection 34\n petition. Therefore, according to Mr. Rai, the\nmere pendency of \nSection 34\n proceedings cannot afford a ground for a party\nto assert that it has a dispute regarding contractual performance.\n\n24. So, it was his submission, the respondent interpreting the order dated\nMarch 23, 2020, which only stays the operation of the impugned Award as an\n'appropriate order' would amount to the respondent getting indirectly what it\ncannot achieve directly in a petition under \nSection 9\n or 34 of the Act.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 11\n\n 25. It was his submission, even otherwise the order dated March 23, 2020\nwas not passed on merits but on the respondent's agreement to deposit the\nentire awarded amount with the petitioners. The order only stayed the\noperation of the impugned Award, which has the effect of staying the\nenforcement of the Award. According to Mr. Rai, it follows that, there is no\npositive direction to the petitioners to keep on extending the bank guarantees\nat their own cost. \nIn support of his submission Mr. Rai relied on the judgment\nof the Supreme Court in the case of \nShree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. vs.\nChurch of South India Trust Association CSI Cinod Secretariat, Madras\n,\n1992 (3) SCC 1.\n\n26. Mr. Rai also stated in the absence of any live and pending claim against\nthe petitioners, there is no ground for the respondent to seek extension of bank\nguarantees.\n\n27. That apart, he stated that the respondent wrongly contends that it has\ncertain unadjudicated claims regarding PGTR. According to him, claims\nregarding PGTR have been expressly dealt by the Arbitral Tribunal in\nparagraphs 336 to 339 of the Award and have been rejected. Further, the\nrespondent did not make any claims in relation to any defects in PP unit.\nFurther, with regard to two advance bank guarantees, despite having\nrecovered the entire mobilization advance and made no claim before the\nArbitral Tribunal, their invocation is clearly fraudulent. In fact, this plea of\nthe petitioners in paragraphs 27 to 29 of the petition has not been denied.\nThus, he seeks the grant of prayers in the petition.\n\n28. On the other hand, Mr. Nakul Dewan, learned Sr. Counsel appearing\nfor the respondent submits that the five bank guarantees of which return is\nsought, are unconditional and irrevocable and out of which four have already\nbeen invoked by the respondent. According to him, contrary to the\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 12\n submissions advanced by Mr. Rai, this case does not raise any important\nprinciples related to arbitration jurisprudence in India. According to him the\nissue is whether the petitioners have been able to demonstrate that bank\nguarantees should be injuncted by this Court by meeting the twin test for grant\nof an injunction restraining the invocation of bank guarantees. These two tests\nare egregious fraud and irretrievable harm on which principles there are\ncatena of cases and which tests the petitioners have failed to meet. He\njustifies the invocation of the bank guarantees on the ground that the\nrespondent has protectable interest related to performance of the contract. It\nwas also the submission of Mr. Dewan that the petitioners cannot get the relief\nof return of the bank guarantees in a petition under the \nSection 9\n of the Act as\nsimilar prayer of the petitioners was not granted by the Arbitral Tribunal and\nalso such a relief being final in nature cannot be granted.\n\n29. He in the alternative submitted that this Court on March 13, 2020 and\non April 15, 2020 required the petitioners to extend the bank guarantees and\nthe respondent was required to deposit the extension charges before this court.\nThe said orders be extended till a decision is arrived at, in a petition filed by\nthe respondent under \nSection 34\n of the Act and in that regard, he sought an\nearly disposal of the said petition.\n\n30. On merits, it was his submission that two contracts between the parties\nis out of a USD 4.2 billion mega grassroot petrochemical project in Asia both\ndated September 2, 2011 for construction of Polyethylene Unit (the PE Unit)\nand a Propylene Unit (PP Unit) respectively. The contracts contained identical\nterms and obligations and were for a cumulative value of about INR 2500\nCrores. Out of that the petitioners have already been paid a sum of INR 1622\nCrores for PE Contract and INR 835 Crores for PP Contract approx.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 13\n\n 31. The schedule completion date under the contract was October, 2013.\nHowever, on that date only barely 40% of the work was completed and the\nProject was still at the stage of construction. He stated as on date all the\ncontracts are still valid and subsisting and the petitioners have not been\ndischarged from their obligations under the contracts. In this regard he states\nthe following:\n\n 1. Claims based on delays caused by the respondent were filed by\n the petitioners.\n\n 2. Counter-claims for (a) delays by way of liquated damages\n (aggregating to 5% of the contract price) and (b) defects were\n filed by the respondents against the petitioners.\n\n 3. The majority award held that the petitioners were entitled to\n their claim for delays inter alia on (a) the basis of a concept of\n sustained pre-commissioning which was not a concept found\n under the contract and (b) on an interpretation of a contractual\n provision which was not argued by either party. The minority\n award held that on plain reading of the contracts, the respondent\n was not liable for delays and the concept sustained pre-\n\n commissioning which was alien to the contract could not be\n imported to foist a contractual liability on the respondent.\n\n 4. The majority award rejected the counter-claims completely,\n which was not entirely agreed to in the minority award.\n\n32. Mr. Dewan stated that in the event this Court set asides the Award in\nthe \nSection 34\n Petition, the respondent would be automatically entitled to\ninvoke the subject bank guarantees for any of the breaches / non-performance\nand there is no requirement for an order or decree of a Court / Tribunal. At\nthe very least the respondent would be entitled to invoke the subject bank\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 14\n guarantee to recover its liquidated damages in respect of which it is settled\nlaw that there is no requirement of an order of a Court or Tribunal for a party\nto invoke a performance guarantee to recover liquidated damages. He stated\nthat the bank guarantees were furnished by the petitioners in favour of the\nrespondent in accordance with clauses 3.3 and 3.8 of the GCC and the same\nare required to be kept valid until the schedule completion date for the works\nof the contract. In this regard, he has drawn my attention to the definition of\n'works' and 'scope of works' in the contracts. Further, he by drawing my\nattention to clause 10.14 of the GCC which stated that the petitioners are\nrequired to achieve PGTR. He stated that even if the petitioners are entitled\nto a claim of deemed PGTR in terms of the Award, the respondents' claims\nfor monies to conduct the PGTR were not granted. The petitioners are\nnonetheless required to assist the respondent with completion of the PGTR at\ntheir costs in a contract which continues to subsist.\n\n33. According to him, in so far as PE Unit is concerned, the PGTR has not\nbeen achieved till date which fact has been acknowledged in the Award. He\nqualifies his submission by stating as under:\n\n 1. The petitioners asserted before the Tribunal that they were\n entitled to a milestone payment of deemed PGTR.\n\n 2. The respondent asserted before the Tribunal that it ought to be\n allowed to complete PGTR on its own and claimed a sum of INR\n 111.70 million and JPY 38.14 million towards additional cost to\n achieve PGTR.\n\n 3. The Tribunal allowed the claim of PGTR and disallowed the\n respondents claim of additional costs to achieve PGTR. In this\n regard he has drawn my attention to Paras 336 and 337 of the\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 15\n Award. He also drawn my attention to the conclusion arrived at\n by the minority.\n\n34. Mr. Dewan stated that in view of the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\nand in a contract which continues to subsist between the parties, the only\nmanner by which PGTR can now be achieved would be in terms of clause\n14.10 (b), which is with the assistance of the petitioners and through costs\npayable by them. That apart, he stated that there are other aspects of the\ncontracts which have not been completed which is a fact that even the\nTribunal recognized that the petitioners had failed to prove in the arbitration.\nHe supports his submission by drawing my attention to Para 32 of the\ncounter-affidavit wherein the respondent has stated that the petitioners have\nabandoned the contract.\n\n35. Mr. Dewan further stated that initially on invocation of the bank\nguarantees, the petitioners filed OMP (I) (COMM) 73/2020 before this Court.\nThis Court by its order dated March 13, 2020, had disposed of the petition\nwhereby it directed that the bank guarantees be extended for a period of one\nmonth within which time, the respondent was to get its \nSection 34\n petition\nlisted and secure appropriate orders.\n\n36. According to him, pursuant thereto the respondent got its \nSection 34\n\npetition listed and this Court by way of its order dated March 23, 2020 stayed\nthe operation of the Award. Therefore, the disputes between the petitioners\nand the respondent continued to subsist and the respondent continues to have\nprotectable interests at this juncture.\n\n37. It was his submission that as the respondent has secured appropriate\norders in its \nSection 34\n petition, and the validity of this bank guarantees was\nexpiring, the respondent rightly addressed the communications on April 5,\n2020 and April 7, 2020, calling the petitioners to extend the bank guarantees.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 16\n In fact, he further stated that the respondent again vide its communication\ndated April 10, 2020 by inter alia stating therein that the petitioners have not\ncomplied with their obligation as contemplated under the contract but not\nlimited to accomplishment of PGTR in case of PE Contract. Notwithstanding\nthe Award the petitioners are fully aware that under the contract, the\npetitioner's obligation to complete the PGTR remains. That apart the\npetitioners are liable for various defects in the commissioning of the PE Unit\nin respect of which the respondent has filed counter-claim aggregating to over\nINR 750 Crores in the arbitration proceedings. It is his submission that the\nentire issue in this petition needs to be considered in the aforesaid\nbackground.\n\n38. On bank guarantees, Mr. Dewan, by drawing my attention to the bank\nguarantees itself stated those are unconditional bank guarantees. The bank\nguarantees are independent contracts between the respondent and the bank\nand the same do not make any reference to the contact between the petitioners\nand the respondents; to any pending arbitration, litigation or appeals and the\nfact they are irrevocable in nature. Therefore, it is his submission despite the\npendency of the proceedings under \nSection 34\n, the respondent is entitled to\ninvoke the bank guarantees. He by saying so challenges the stand of the\npetitioners that the invocation of the bank guarantees is not in accordance with\nthe terms therein. \nIn support of this submission that the court should not\ninterfere with the invocation of unconditional bank guarantees unless a case of\negregious fraud or irretrievable harm is made out, he relied upon the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of \nHimadri Chemicals Industries\nLtd. v. Coaltar Refining Company\n, 2007 8 SCC 110.\n \nHe also relied upon a\nrecent Judgment of the Supreme Court on a similar proposition in the case of\n\nStandard Chartered Bank v. Heavy Engineering Cooperation Limited\n, 2019\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 17\n SCC Online SC 1638. Mr. Dewan would submit that the plea of Mr. Rai that\nthe invocation of the bank guarantees is fraudulent as the respondent has gone\nbehind the arbitral Award as well as the orders of this Court which required\nthe respondent to get their petition listed under \nSection 34\n and secure\nappropriate orders and the respondent has failed to secure such appropriate\norders is concerned, he stated that such a submission is without any basis and\nthe respondents continues to have disputes with the petitioners and for that\nreason the respondent is entitled to invoke the bank guarantees. According to\nhim merely because an arbitral Award has been pronounced against the\nrespondent does not mean that pending its challenge, the disputes cease to\nexist.\n \nIn this regard he has relied upon the Judgment of the Supreme Court in\n\nK. Kishan v. Vijay Nirman Company Pvt. Ltd.\n, 2018 (10) SCALE 256,\nwherein the Court has inter alia stated that the filing of petition under \nSection\n34\n of the Act against an arbitral award shows that a pre-existing dispute which\nculminates at the first stage of the proceedings in an award continues even\nafter the award, at least till the final adjudicatory process under \nSection 34\n and\n\n37\n has taken place.\n \nTherefore, the reliance placed by Mr. Rai on the judgment\nof the Supreme Court in \nShree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd.\n (supra) is irrelevant.\nIn other words, it was his submission that once dispute between the parties has\nculminated into an award and the subject matter of a challenge under \nSection\n34\n of the Act, there is a continuation of the dispute between the parties.\nTherefore, the distinction between a stay on the award and a stay on the\noperation of the award are really not relevant for this case. He highlights the\nfact that the invocation was necessitated because of failures on the petitioners\nto extend the validity of the bank guarantees until the culmination of the\ndisputes between the parties. Therefore, the petitioners have failed to make\nout case for injunction on the ground of irretrievable harm or injustice or\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 18\n special equities.\n \nHe by relying upon the Judgement of this Court in the case\nof \nIndu Projects Ltd. v. Union of India\n, 2013 (139) DRJ 260, wherein it is\nheld inter alia that overall judgments pertaining to the bank guarantees would\nshow that Courts have interchangeably used the expression special equities\nwith expression such as irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice.\n\n39. It was his submission that the Courts have consistently held that in\norder to make out a case for injunction on the ground of irretrievable injury or\nspecial equities an aggrieved party must be able to prove that it would be\nimpossible to recover the amount paid out under the bank guarantee, if it\nultimately succeeds in the disputes between the parties. \nIn this regard he has\nrelied upon the Judgment in the case of \nU.P. State Sugar Corporation v.\nSUMAC International Ltd.\n, 1997 1 SCC 568.\n\n40. That apart it was his submission that the respondent is a Public Sector\nUndertaking and the petitioners will not be impeded in any manner from\nrecovering the money encashed by the respondent under the bank guarantees\nif the petitioner ultimately succeeds.\n\n41. He stated that the plea of Mr. Rai that if it is ultimately found that the\ninvocation was wrong, the petitioners have to initiate separate arbitration\nproceedings to recover the monies paid out to the respondent under the bank\nguarantees and therefore the special equities are in their favour is an untenable\nargument. In this regard, he reiterated his submission that the bank\nguarantees are unconditional and irrevocable guarantees, invocation of which\ncan only be rejected under the two exceptions which have been stated above.\nFurther, the plea of Mr. Rai of irretrievable injury is also without evidence.\n\n42. On the Judgment of Mukti Credits Pvt. Ltd.(supra) as relied upon by\nMr. Rai, Mr. Dewan submitted that the said judgment cannot be binding\nprecedent on this Court because apart from the fact that it is based on a report\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 19\n by DIAC and (not the Arbitral Tribunal) which quantified a claim that does\nnot consider \nSection 9\n of the Act and the limitation of the powers set out\ntherein (b)does not consider the law related to invocation of bank guarantees\nand the limitation of the exercise of powers by the Court in such matters.\n\n43. On the judgments relied upon by Mr. Rai, he stated that the same are\nentirely misplaced. On Nussli (supra), he stated that the respondent has not\nfiled a petition under \nSection 9\n of the Act for the Judgment to be applicable\nand in any case in appeal against Nussli(supra) judgment, the Supreme Court\ndirected for the extension of the bank guarantees pending adjudication of the\ndispute which was consistent with approach adopted by the Single Judge of\nthis Court in the same case.\n\n44. Finally, he stated that the present petition is liable to be dismissed\nalternatively as suggested that the orders dated April 13, 2020 and April 15,\n2020 be continued till the disputes between the parties culminates with the\nhearing of the petition under \nSection 34\n of the Act on a date convenient to this\nCourt.\n\n45. In his rejoinder submissions, Mr. Rai, contested the arguments\nadvanced by Mr. Dewan, that the respondent is entitled to seek the extension\nof the Bank Guarantees for the reason, it has a fresh-claim on account of\nPGTR against the petitioners and \nSection 34\n petition is pending.\n\n46. Mr. Rai stated that all the claims that the respondent had qua\npetitioner's obligation to conduct PGTR were made before arbitral tribunal,\nwhich rejected them, as can be seen from the Award that the counter-claim\nwas \"for additional costs to achieve PGTR\". He also stated that till date no\nnew demand or claim has been made by respondent against the petitioner qua\nany obligations to conduct a PGTR. According to Mr. Rai, the argument is an\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 20\n after thought to defend and unsustainable invocation of the Bank Guarantees.\nIn this regard he has highlighted the following:\n\n 1. In its first mail seeking extension dated March 7,2020, the\n respondent referred to \nSection 34\n petition for seeking extension of the\n Bank Guarantees.\n\n 2. Even subsequently, when communicating its extend or pay demand\n for the second time on March 05, 2020, the respondent only referred to\n the pendency of \nSection 34\n petition as the basis for seeking an\n extension of the Bank Guarantees.\n\n 3. The reliance placed by Mr. Dewan on paragraphs 24-31 of the\n respondent's counter-affidavit for its new/fresh PGTR claim, do not\n relate to any fresh claim or refer to Clause 10.14(b) and therefore,\n reliance on the said clause is clearly an after-thought to somehow create\n a claim.\n\n47. According to Mr. Rai, the PGTR was to be conducted within 12\nmonths from the date of successful completion of commissioning. This\naccording to Mr. Rai, is important because the respondent's counter-claim\nwas filed on April, 02, 2018. In fact, according to him, no defect was raised\nfor PP unit and the PGTR was successfully completed by the petitioner and\npayment for the same was made by the respondent.\n\n48. \nInsofar as the reliance placed by Mr. Dewan on the judgment of the\nSupreme Court in the case of \nK. Kishan\n (supra) is concerned, Mr. Rai stated\nthat \nthe said decision\n is in the context of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,\n2016 ('IBC', for short) and only deals with the concept of pre-existing dispute\nas defined in IBC, in respect of commencement of the insolvency process by\nan operation creditor.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 21\n\n 49. He also stated that the submission of Mr. Dewan that petitioner is a\nforeign entity and therefore the respondent is required to be secured is a\nmisplaced-argument. He stated, a similar argument was rejected in Nussli\n(supra). He also stated the plea of Mr. Dewan that the Bank Guarantees be\nencashed and the money thereof be deposited in the Court is also an absurd\nargument and need to be rejected. He reiterated the prayers in the petition.\n\n50. Mr. Dewan also made rejoinder submissions wherein he primarily\nreiterated his earlier submissions in the following manner:\n\n 1. No novel issue arises in these proceedings. It is simply an issue\n related to injunction/return of the Bank Guarantees.\n\n 2. The test for injunction has not been made out.\n\n 3. The contractual security in favour of the respondent ought to be\n protected and adjudication of statutory rights given to the respondent.\n\n 4. The judgments of Dirk Industries (supra) and Nussli (supra) on\n which reliance is placed by Mr. Rai is totally misplaced.\n\n51. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and considered the\nrecord, before I deal with the submissions made by the Sr. Counsels for\nparties, the submissions of Mr. Rai as noted above can summed up as (i) the\nbank guarantees are those which were provided to the respondent during the\nperformance of the contracts; (ii) the petitioner performed the contracts and\ncommissioning certificates dated February 15, 2017 and April 14, 2017 have\nbeen issued and plants have achieved 100% capacity utilization; (iii) the\npetitioners' claims have been allowed by the Arbitral Tribunal and the\ncounter-claims of the respondent rejected; (iv) a losing party in an arbitration\ncannot seek extension of the bank guarantees or invoke them once it has\nsuffered an Award; (v) the respondent demanded the extension of validity of\nbank guarantees on the ground it has challenged the final Award; (vi) for the\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 22\n first time, on April 10, 2020, the respondent has taken a stand that bank\nguarantees are required to be extended as petitioner failed to perform the\ncontracts, which is an incorrect stand; (vii) by order dated March 13, 2020,\nthis court directed the petitioner to extend the bank guarantees for one month\nwithin which time, the respondent was to seek appropriate orders in its\n\nSection 34\n petition which the respondent failed to secure; (viii) no direction\nfor extension of bank guarantees was given in \nSection 34\n petition; (ix) the\nstay application in the petition under \nSection 34\n of the Act does not refer at all\nto the bank guarantees; (x) mere pendency of \nSection 34\n proceedings does not\nmean dispute regarding contractual performance exist between the parties;\n\n(xi) there is no live or pending claim against the petitioners to seek extension\nof bank guarantees; (xii) there were no claims regarding defects in PP Unit.\nFurther, the claim of the respondent regarding PGTR expressly dealt with by\nthe Tribunal in paragraphs 336 to 339 of the Award and rejected the same;\n\n(xiii) with regard to two bank guarantees, despite having recovered the entire\nmobilization advanced and the counter-claims before Arbitral Tribunal having\nbeen rejected, the invocation is fraudulent; and (xiv) the petitioners have to\ninitiate separate arbitration proceedings to recover the monies paid out to the\nrespondent under the bank guarantees and therefore the special equities are in\ntheir favour.\n\n52. On the other hand, the submissions made by Mr. Nakul Dewan can be\nsummed up as follows (i) the bank guarantees are unconditional and\nirrevocable, out of which four have already been invoked; (ii) this case needs\nto be seen and decided on the principles governing grant of injunction,\nrestraining the invocation of the bank guarantees on the twin test of egregious\nfraud or irretrievable harm, which are not satisfied; (iii) the invocation of\nbank guarantees is justified as the respondent has protectable interest related\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 23\n to the performance of the contract; (iv) the petitioners cannot get the relief of\nreturn of bank guarantees as similar prayer was rejected by the Arbitral\nTribunal, more so in a petition under \nSection 9\n of the Ac; (v) alternatively,\nthis Court extend the orders dated March 13, 2020 and April 15, 2020 which\nrequires the petitioners to extend the validity of the bank guarantees and the\nrespondent shall deposit the charges in the Court till the decision of \nSection\n34\n Petition; (vi) as of today, all the contracts are still valid and subsisting and\nthe petitioners have not been able to discharge their obligations under the\ncontracts; (vii) merely because an arbitral Award has been pronounced against\nthe respondent does not mean that pending its challenge, the disputes cease to\nexist; and (viii) if the Court set asides the Award in the \nSection 34\n Petition,\nthe respondent would automatically be entitled to invoke bank guarantees for\nany breaches / non-performance and recover its liquidated damages in respect\nof which it is settled law that there is no requirement of an order of Court /\nTribunal.\n\n53. Having noted the broad submissions made by the Senior Counsels it is\na fact that as per the contracts, the petitioners had in terms of Clauses 3.3 and\n3.8 of the GCC, had furnished performance bank guarantees, guaranteeing the\nexecution and performance of the contract and advanced bank guarantees to\nsecure the mobilization advance paid by the respondents to the petitioners.\nOut of the five bank guarantees, two are advanced bank guarantees and three\nare performance bank guarantees. It is a conceded case of the parties that the\nscheduled date of completion of commissioning of both the Units was on or\nbefore October 2, 2013. But in fact, the units were commissioned on April\n14, 2017 and February 12, 2017 respectively. Disputes arose between the\nparties which went to arbitration. The primary claim of the petitioner was for\ndamages on account of delay on the part of the respondent in completing and\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 24\n commissioning of the project. The respondent had also filed counter-claims\nseeking liquidated damages for the delay in commissioning both the units\nattributable to the petitioners and also for losses and damages incurred by\nrespondent on account of defects and damages discovered in the PE Unit and\nclaim on PGTR. The Arbitral Tribunal speaking through majority allowed\nthe claims of the petitioners and rejected the counter-claims. The respondent\nhas challenged the Award in a \nSection 34\n petition which is pending\nconsideration of this court. When the said petition was listed on March 23,\n2020, this Court on the submission made by Mr. Dewan, directed that the\nawarded amount shall be paid by the respondent to the petitioners on the\npetitioners furnishing bank guarantee for the awarded amount stayed the\noperation of the Award.\n\n54. So, it follows that the Award of the Arbitral Tribunal enures to the\nbenefit of the petitioners being a successful party. It is the successful party\nwho can seek its enforcement under \nSection 36\n of the Act and also secure the\nAward under \nsection 9\n of the Act and not the respondent being the losing\nparty. This position of law is well settled by the judgment of the Bombay\nHigh Court as upheld by the Supreme Court in case of Dirk (Supra) wherein\nin paragraphs 13 & 14, the Court has held as under:\n\n \"13. The Court which exercises jurisdiction under \nSection 34\n is\n not a court of first appeal under the provisions \nof the Code of\n Civil Procedure\n. An appellate court to which recourse is taken\n against a decree of the trial Court has powers which are co-\n extensive with those of the trial Court. A party which has failed in\n its claim before a trial Judge can in appeal seek a judgment of\n reversal and in consequence, the passing of a decree in terms of\n the claim in the suit. The court to which an arbitration petition\n challenging the award under \nSection 34\n lies does not pass an\n order decreeing the claim. Where an arbitral claim has been\n rejected by the arbitral tribunal, the court under \nSection 34\n may\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 25\n either dismiss the objection to the arbitral award or in the\n exercise of its jurisdiction set aside the arbitral award. The\n setting aside of an arbitral award rejecting a claim does not\n result in the claim which was rejected by the Arbitrator being\n decreed as a result of the judgment of the court in a petition\n under \nSection 34\n. To hold that a petition under \nSection 9\n would\n be maintainable after the passing of an arbitral award at the\n behest of DIPL whose claim has been rejected would result in a\n perversion of the object and purpose underlying \nSection 9\n of the\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. DIPL's application under\n \nSection 9\n, if allowed, would result in the grant of interim specific\n performance of a contract in the teeth of the findings recorded in\n the arbitral award. The interference by the Court at this stage to\n grant what in essence is a plea for a mandatory order for interim\n specific performance will negate the sanctity and efficacy of\n arbitration as a form of alternate disputes redressal. What such a\n litigating party cannot possibly obtain even upon completion of\n the proceedings under \nSection 34\n, it cannot possibly secure in a\n petition under \nSection 9\n after the award. The object and purpose\n of \nSection 9\n is to provide an interim measure that would protect\n the subject-matter of the arbitral proceedings whether before or\n during the continuance of the arbitral proceedings and even\n thereafter upon conclusion of the proceedings until the award is\n enforced. Once the award has been made and a claim has been\n rejected as in the present case, even a successful challenge to the\n award under \nSection 34\n does not result an order decreeing the\n claim. In this view of the matter, there could be no occasion to\n take recourse to \nSection 9\n. Enforcement for the purpose of\n \nSection 36\n as a decree of the Court is at the behest of a person\n who seeks to enforce the award. (Emphasis supplied)\n\n55. The judgment of Dirk (Supra) is followed by this Court in Nussli\nSwitzerland (Supra) wherein the Division Bench agreed with the reasoning of\nthe Court in Dirk (Supra).\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 26\n\n 56. \nIn fact, I in the case of \nSinghania Horizons\n (supra), has also followed\njudgments in Dirk (supra) and Nussli Switzerland (supra) to hold that a\nlosing party cannot file a petition under \nSection 9\n of the Act.\n It is the\nsubmission of Mr. Dewan that the Nussli Switzerland (Supra) is pending\nconsideration before the Supreme Court in SLP(C) No. 026876 -\n026876/2014. He has placed before me the order dated September 26, 2014 in\nthe said special leave petition wherein the Supreme Court has directed the\nextension of the Bank guarantees till further orders. Mr. Dewan, however,\nconcedes to the fact that the Supreme Court has not stayed the judgment of the\nDivision Bench in Nussli Switzerland (Supra).\n\n57. It appears that the respondent being a losing party, in order to overcome\nthe Judgment in Dirk (Supra), as it could not have approached the Court in\n\nSection 9\n and sought an order against the petitioners that they shall keep the\nbank guarantees alive till \nSection 34\n petition is decided, proceeded to invoke\nthe bank guarantees. Mr. Rai is right to contend that the respondent by\ninvoking the bank guarantees, did what they could not have done directly.\nMr. Rai is also right in stating that when this Court vide order dated March\n13, 2020 disposed of OMP (I) (COMM) 73/2020 directing the petitioners to\nextend the bank guarantees by a period of one month to enable the respondent\nto get its petition under \nSection 34\n listed and secure appropriate orders, which\nthe respondent failed to secure at least with regard to securing bank\nguarantees, they are precluded from invoking the same.\n\n58. It was the submission Mr. Dewan that (1) disputes continue to exist till\nsuch time the arbitral Award attains finality in the Supreme Court; (2) there\nare other obligations under the contracts which have not been completed by\nthe petitioner for which reason the respondent can invoke the bank guarantees.\nOn the first aspect, he has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 \nPage 27\n K. Kishan\n (Supra). The issue involved in \nthe said judgment\n was whether IBC\ncan be invoked against an operational debtor against whom an arbitral award\nhas been passed which is challenged in a \nSection 34\n petition under the Act\nand is pending adjudication.\n \nThe Supreme Court after referring to its earlier\njudgment in \nMobilox Innovations Private Limited v. Kirusa Software Private\nLimited\n, (2018) 1 SCC 353, held that when a 'dispute' pre-exists or is on-\ngoing between the parties, operational creditors cannot use IBC either\nprematurely or for extraneous considerations or as a substitute for debt\nenforcement procedures. The judgment further holds that the challenge to the\narbitral award means the 'dispute' between the parties continue, in which case\nan application preferred by the operational creditor must be rejected. So, the\njudgment of the Supreme Court has been considered in the context of IBC that\na 'dispute' continues to exist between the parties when the arbitral award is\nunder challenge. The said judgment has no applicability in the facts of this\ncase as it does not relate to a litigation under the IBC.\n\n59. On the second submission he drew the attention of the Court to an e-\nmail dated April 10, 2020 of the respondent to the petitioners and also Para 32\nof the counter-affidavit. To understand the submission, it is necessary to\nreproduce Para 11 of the e-mail dated April 10, 2020 and Para 30 to 33 of the\ncounter-affidavit, as under :\n\n \"11. The bank guarantees were created under Clause 3.3 and 3.8\n of the Contracts dated 02.09.2011 (\"Contracts\") to secure the\n performance of your clients' obligations under the Contracts.\n You are well aware that till date, your clients have not complied\n with their obligations as contemplated under the contracts\n including but not limited to accomplishment of Performance\n Guarantee Test Run (\"PGTR\") in case PE Contract.\n Notwithstanding the Award, you are fully aware that under the\n Contract your clients' obligation to complete the PGTR remains.\n Furthermore, your clients are liable for various defects in the\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 28\n commissioning of the PE Unit in respect of which our client had\n filed a counterclaim aggregating to over INR 750 Crores in the\n arbitration proceedings. In view of the stay of the Impugned\n Award, your clients are now required to keep the Subject Bank\n Guarantees alive so as to secure our client's interests and claims\n under the Contracts. Since the validity of the bank guarantees in\n question are expiring by 14.04.2020 and 17.04.2020, our client\n has no option but to invoke them in order to prevent those\n guarantees from lapsing. Our client cannot afford to lose the\n security available. In this time of pandemic and resultant\n restrictions, as a matter of necessity these guarantees have to be\n saved from lapsing and our client will resort, in good faith ,such\n actions which are necessary to protect its security and also to\n mitigate the situation until the Hon'ble Court rule on matters\n pending before it.\"\n\n XXX XXXX XXXX XXX\n\n COUNTER-AFFIDAVIT\n\n XXXXXXXX\n\n \"30. By way of its Counterclaim, OPaL contended that it is entitled\n to Liquidated damages for the delay in commissioning of both PE\n and PP Units due to the delays caused by Tecnimont and also for\n the losses and damages incurred by OPaL on account of the defects\n and damages discovered in the PE Unit. OPaL also claimed that\n Tecnimont was in breach of its obligations to complete the PGTR of\n the respective units. The Respondent craves leave to refer to the\n Statement of Claim, Counterclaim and other pleadings in the\n arbitration proceedings when produced\n\n 31. It is submitted that under the Contracts, OPaL is entitled to\n recover the following amounts by invoking the bank guarantees\n issued in its favour under the terms of the Contracts, without\n resorting to a fresh arbitration, in the event the Impugned Award is\n set aside by this Hon'ble High Court:\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 29\n S. No Particulars Amounts\n\n 1. Liquidated Damages of 5 percent INR 491.21 million\n of the contract value for both PP USD 5.46 million\n Unit and PE Unit under Clause EUR 3.86 million\n 6.3.2 of GCC of both PE and PP\n Contract\n\n 2. Defects caused to the PE Unit (a) INR 2,819.82\n and for non-achievement of million towards\n PGTR of the PE Unit under loss of incremental\n Clause 6.1 and Clause 10 of the profits of the PE\n GCC of the PE Contract Unit\n\n (b) INR 4,773.42\n million towards\n impact on DFCU\n and\n\n (c) INR 111.70\n million and JPY\n 38.14 million for\n additional cost to\n achieve PGTR\n\n 3.

Change orders INR 79.43 million\n and USD 0.46\n million\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 30\n\n 32. Further, undisputedly, Tecnimont's entire technical team abandoned\n OPaL's Dahej Plant during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings\n without any proper intimation to OPaL and without completing the\n entire Scope of Works including PGTR of the PE Unit and closure of\n punch points and others. Till date, in spite of several requests from\n OPaL, Tecnimont flagrantly failed and neglected to supply the complete\n set of mandatory spares under the Contracts. In this regard, it is\n pertinent to mention that Clause 11 of the Contracts provides that\n Tecnimont is obligated to perform the works under the Contract\n notwithstanding pendency of the arbitration proceedings. Clause 11 is\n reproduced below:\n\n \"11.0 Continuation of the Contract\n Notwithstanding the fact that settlement of dispute(s) (if\n any) under arbitration may be pending, the Contractor\n shall continue to be governed by and perform the work in\n accordance with the provisions under this Contract.\"\n\n Therefore, Tecnimont's assertion that the entire Scope of Work\n under the Contracts has been completed is incorrect.\n\n 33. It is submitted that if the Impugned Award is set aside, OPaL\n would be entitled to recover the amounts by invoking the bank\n guarantees without resorting to fresh arbitration. The bank\n guarantees are furnished as security towards OPaL's claims\n against Tecnimont and under the Contracts OPaL is entitled to\n recover the said amounts without first resorting to any dispute\n resolution including arbitration.\"\n\n60. On a reading of the above paras as reproduced it is clear that the\nrespondent in its counter-claims before the Arbitral Tribunal had sought:\n\n i. Liquidated damages for the delay in commissioning of both\n PE and PP Units caused by the petitioners.\n\n ii. Losses and damages incurred by the respondent on account\n of defects and damages discovered in PE Unit.\n iii. Interest on mobilization advance.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 31\n iv. Additional Insurance Premium.\n v. Charge Orders\n\n61. During his submissions, Mr. Dewan would contend that the respondent\nhas fresh claims regarding PGTR, by referring to para 11 of e-mail dated\nApril 10, 2020 (reproduced above). In other words, he tries to draw a\ndistinction between the counter-claims made before the Tribunal and the\nclaims over and above the counter-claims to justify the invocation. Such a\nplea does not flow either from the e-mail dated April 10, 2020 nor from the\ncounter-affidavit (reproduced above) filed by the respondent. The said e-mail\nonly narrates the stand of the respondent that the petitioners have not\naccomplished the PGTR. It is not the case of the respondent that in its\ncounter-claims, the respondent has not sought the sums to achieve PGTR\nthemselves. Even otherwise, I find that the respondent in its written\narguments filed in the court has stated \"the respondent asserted before the\nHon'ble Tribunal that it ought to be allowed to complete to PGTR on its own\nand claimed a sum of INR 111.70 million and JPY 38.14 million towards\nadditional cost to achieve PGTR\" . This statement of respondent corresponds\nwith the final Award which reads \"for additional cost to achieve PGTR\", and\nthe claim was rejected.\n\n62. Mr. Rai is justified in stating the plea of Mr. Dewan, is an afterthought\nas no such stand was taken by the respondent in its earlier e-mails dated\nMarch 7, 2020 and April 5, 2020.\n\n63. It is clear that the respondent by invoking the bank guarantees intends\nto secure counter-claims which were rejected by the arbitral tribunal, which is\nclearly impermissible in view of the position of law noted above.\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 32\n\n 64. Insofar as the plea of Mr. Dewan that if the arbitral Award is set aside,\nthe respondent can invoke the Bank Guarantees to satisfy its claims without\nresorting to arbitration / Court is a fallacious argument.\n\n65. It is settled law that the claims (counter-claims in this case) so rejected\nare not deemed to have been allowed in favour of respondent as held by the\nBombay High Court in Dirk (supra) in Para 13, the relevant part reads as\nunder:\n\n \"13. The Court which exercises jurisdiction under \nSection 34\n\n is not a court of first appeal under the provisions \nof the Code\n of Civil Procedure\n. An appellate court to which recourse is\n taken against a decree of the trial Court has powers which are\n co-extensive with those of the trial Court. A party which has\n failed in its claim before a trial Judge can in appeal seek a\n judgment of reversal and in consequence, the passing of a\n decree in terms of the claim in the suit. The court to which an\n arbitration petition challenging the award under \nSection 34\n\n lies does not pass an order decreeing the claim. Where an\n arbitral claim has been rejected by the arbitral tribunal, the\n court under \nSection 34\n may either dismiss the objection to the\n arbitral award or in the exercise of its jurisdiction set aside\n the arbitral award. The setting aside of an arbitral award\n rejecting a claim does not result in the claim which was\n rejected by the Arbitrator being decreed as a result of the\n judgment of the court in a petition under \nSection 34\n\"\n\n66. The aforesaid view has been reiterated by another Division Bench of\nBombay High court in the case of \nOil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v.\nConsortium of Sime Darby Engineering Sdn\n. Bhd. and Swiber Offshore\nConstruction Pte. Ltd., 2018 SCC Online Bom 6034, wherein in Para 11\nstates as under:\n\n \"11. The Division Bench of this Court in Dirk India Pvt.\n Ltd. (supra) has held that the enforcement of an award enures\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 33\n to the benefit of the party who has secured an award in the\n arbitral proceedings and the party whose claim has been\n rejected in the course of arbitral proceedings cannot have\n arbitral award enforced in accordance with \nSection 36\n of the\n Act. The Court to which the arbitration petition challenging\n the award under \nSection 34\n of the Act lies does not pass an\n order decreeing the claim. Where an arbitral claim has been\n rejected by the arbitral tribunal, the Court under \nSection 34\n of\n the Act either may dismiss the objection to the arbitral award\n or in exercise of its jurisdiction may set aside the arbitral\n award. The setting aside of the arbitral award in rejecting the\n claim does not result in the claim which was rejected by the\n arbitral tribunal being decreed as a result of the judgment of\n the Court in a petition under \nSection 34\n. It was held that the\n interference by the court to grant a mandatory order will\n negate the sanctity and efficacy of the arbitration as a form of\n alternate dispute redressal.\"\n\n67. \nIn fact, a similar view has been taken by the Division Bench of this\nCourt in the case of \nState Trading Corporation of India Ltd. v. Toepfer\nInternational Asia PTE Ltd.\n, 2014 (144) DRJ 220, wherein in paragraph 7,\nthe Division Bench held as under:\n\n \"7. Arbitration is intended to be a faster and less expensive\n alternative to the courts. If this is one's motivation and\n expectation, then the finality of the arbitral award is very\n important. The remedy provided in \nSection 34\n against an\n arbitral award is in no sense an appeal. The legislative intent\n in \nSection 34\n was to make the result of the annulment\n procedure prescribed therein potentially different from that in\n an appeal. In appeal, the decision under review not only may\n be confirmed, but may also be modified. In annulment, on the\n other hand, the decision under review may either be\n invalidated in whole or in part or be left to stand if the plea for\n annulment is rejected. Annulment operates to negate a\n decision, in whole or in part, thereby depriving the portion\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 34\n negated of legal force and returning the parties, as to that\n portion, to their original litigating positions. Annulment can\n void, while appeal can modify. \nSection 34\n is found to provide\n for annulment only on the grounds affecting legitimacy of the\n process of decision as distinct from substantive correctness of\n the contents of the decision. A remedy of appeal focuses upon\n both legitimacy of the process of decision and the substantive\n correctness of the decision. Annulment, in the case of\n arbitration focuses not on the correctness of decision but\n rather more narrowly considers whether, regardless of errors\n in application of law or determination of facts, the decision\n resulted from a legitimate process.\"\n\n68. It is clear that the even if the respondent succeeds in its \nSection 34\n\npetition, the setting aside of the arbitral Award in rejecting the counter-claims\nof the respondent does not result in the same being decreed in its favour. It\nwould be open to the respondent to commence fresh proceedings against the\npetitioners (Ref. \nInternational Inc. v. Burn Standard Co. Ltd.\n, (2006) 11\nSCC 181).\n\n69 It follows that, till such time there is an adjudication of the counter-\nclaims, in favour of the respondent, no sum is due in praesenti nor any sum is\npayable to the respondent, for it to invoke the bank guarantees. This I say so\nin view of the Judgment of the Bombay High Court in Iron Hardware (India)\nCompany a Firm v. Shyamlal Brothers, A Farm, AIR 1954 BOM 523,\nwherein the Court inter alia held as under:\n\n \"7. Now, this principle has been accepted by the learned\n Judge below, but the reason why he has taken a different view\n is that the definition of \"debt\" given in this Act is an artificial\n definition and is not the definition which has been accepted for\n the purpose of the \nTransfer of Property Act\n, and what is\n emphasised is that debt is not merely a liability which is\n ascertained, but it is also a liability which is to be ascertained,\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 35\n and therefore the view is taken that unliquidated damages\n would constitute a debt within the meaning of this Act. In my\n opinion, with respect to the learned Judge, greater emphasis\n should be placed on the expression \"any pecuniary liability\"\n\n rather than on the expression \"whether ascertained or to be\n ascertained\". Before it could be said of a claim that it, is a\n debt, the Court must be satisfied that there is a pecuniary\n liability upon the person against whom the claim is made, and\n the question is whether in law a person who commits a breach\n of contract becomes pecuniarily liable to the other, party to\n the contract. In my opinion it would not be true to say that a\n person who commits a breach of the contract incurs any\n pecuniary liability, nor would it be true to say that the other\n party to the contract who complains of the breaches has any\n amount due to him from the other party.\n\n As already stated, the only right which he has is the right to go\n to a Court of law and recover damages. Now, damages are the\n compensation which a Court of law gives to a party for the\n injury which he has sustained. But, and this is most important\n to note, he does not get damage or compensation by reason of\n any existing obligation on the part of the person who has com\n mitted the breach. He gets compensation as a result of the fiat\n of the Court. Therefore, no pecuniary liability arises till the\n Court has determined that the party complaining of the breach\n is entitled to damages. Therefore, when damages are assessed,\n it would not be true to say that what the Court is doing is\n ascertaining a pecuniary liability which already existed. The\n Court in the first place must decide that the defendant is liable\n and then it proceeds to assess what that liability is. But till that\n determination there is no liability at all upon the\n defendant......\"\n\n70. A similar view had been taken by the Calcutta High Court in the case of\n\nJabed Sheikh v. Taher Mallick\n, AIR 1941 Cal. 629.\n\n71. The submission made by Mr. Dewan that the invocation of the bank\nguarantees has to be strictly seen as per the law relating to the bank guarantees\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 36\n by referring to the judgments in the case of \nHimadri Chemicals Industries\nLtd.\n (supra); \nStandard Chartered Bank\n (supra); \nIndu Project Ltd.\n (supra)\nand \nU.P. State Sugar Corporation\n (supra), is misplaced. The said proposition\nis not applicable in the facts of this case and in view of my conclusion above.\nEven otherwise, a reading of these judgments reveal that a bank is bound to\nhonor the bank guarantee irrespective of disputes between the party at whose\ninstance the guarantee was issued and the beneficiary, subject to two\nexceptions i.e. when it is a case of egregious fraud, irretrievable injustice or\nirretrievable harm, the Court can grant injunction. It also emerges that every\ncase has to be decided with reference to the facts and circumstances as\nexisting.\n \nIt is also noted that in \nIndu Projects Ltd.\n (supra), a Coordinate\nBench of this Court held that the expression irretrievable injury or\nirretrievable injustice have been used interchangeably with expression special\nequities.\n \nHowever, the Apex Court in the judgment of \nStandard Chartered\n\n(Supra) as relied upon by Mr. Dewan, visualized the irretrievable injustice\nand special equities as distinct circumstances.\n \nThis is so held by a Coordinate\nBench of this Court in the case of \nHalliburton Offshore Services Inc v.\nVedanta Ltd. and Anr.\n, 2020 SCC Online Delhi 542, by relying upon the\nSupreme Court judgment in the case of \nStandard Chartered Bank Ltd.\n\n(Supra) in paragraph 17, which reads as under:\n\n \"17. In my view, it is not necessary to multiply references to\n precedents, the law with respect to injunction of encashment,\n or invocation, of unconditional bank guarantees, being fairly\n well settled. It is significant, however, that, where the earlier\n understanding of the expression \"special equities\", as a\n circumstance in which invocation of bank guarantees could\n be inducted, was that such equities were limited to cases\n where irretrievable injustice resulted, the recent decision\n in Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, 8 seems to visualize\n irretrievable injustice, and special equities, as distinct\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 37\n circumstances, the existence of either of which would justify\n an order of injunction. Viewed any which way, there appears\n to be no gainsaying the proposition that, where \"special\n equities\" exist, the court is empowered, in a given set of facts\n and circumstances, to injunct invocation, or encashment, of a\n bank guarantee. Where such special circumstances do exist,\n no occasion arises, to revert to the general principle\n regarding the contractually binding nature of a bank\n guarantee, or the legal obligation of the bank to honour the\n bank guarantee, these special circumstances having, in all\n cases, being treated as exceptions to this general principle.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n72. In the case in hand, the following facts also cumulatively demonstrate\nspecial equities in favour of the petitioners:\n\n i. The petitioners have an arbitral Award in its favor;\n ii. The counter-claims have been dismissed;\n iii. The respondent did not secure any order with regard to\n extension of the bank guarantees;\n\n iv. It is the case of the petitioners that advance bank\n guarantees were furnished against mobilization advance\n given by the respondent which have since been recovered\n by the respondent through running account bills, the said\n aspect has not been denied by the respondent in Para 27\n and 29 of its reply to the petition;\n\n v. The bank guarantees given during the contract cannot be\n said to have been given in perpetuity even for the period,\n after the adjudication of claims / counter-claims, between\n the parties;\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 38\n vi. There is no sum due in praesenti or sum payable to the\n respondent;\n\n vii. Even if the respondent succeeds in its challenge to the\n Award under \nSection 34\n, it has to resort to fresh arbitration\n proceedings with regard to the counter-claims and;\n viii. That after invocation/encashment of the bank guarantees\n by the respondent, the petitioners have to resort to the\n process of arbitration to claim the amount.\n\n73. In fact, I also rely on a Coordinate Bench judgment of this Court in\nM/s. Mukti Credits Pvt. Ltd. (supra), wherein the Court has restrained the\nrespondent therein from invoking a bank guarantee, post an arbitral award on\nthe ground that no sum was due to the respondent and the objections of both\nthe parties to arbitral award under \nSection 34\n were pending. The plea of Mr.\nDewan on the non-applicability of this judgment is misplaced.\n\n74. During his submissions, Mr. Dewan had stated that the petitioner be\ndirected by this Court to continue to extend the validity of the bank guarantees\nwith charges for such extension to be deposited by the respondent in this\nCourt or in the alternative, the respondent be allowed to invoke the bank\nguarantees and deposit the money in this Court. This submission, is clearly\ninequitable in view of the facts and circumstances of this present case. If such\na plea is allowed every party even after losing before an Arbitral Tribunal, on\nthe pretext that the bank guarantees cannot be injuncted or it shall deposit the\namount in the Court, shall achieve what it could not achieve before the\nArbitral Tribunal, through claims / counter-claims (as in the case of the\nrespondent).\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 39\n\n 75. In view of my above discussion, the present petition is allowed. The\nrespondent is restrained from invoking / encashing the bank guarantees as\nreferred to in para (a) of the prayer clause. It is also directed that the\nrespondent shall return to the petitioners the said bank guarantees.\n\n76. The direction to return the bank guarantees by the respondent to the\npetitioners shall not be given effect till June 29, 2020 (including the said\ndate). The petition is disposed of. No costs.\n\n V. KAMESWAR RAO, J\n\n JUNE 20, 2020/ak/jg\n\nOMP (I) (COMM) 87/2020 Page 40",
