These four criminal appeals have been preferred\nby the common Appellant (original complainant)\nagainst four separate orders of the High Court of\nJudicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench),\ngranting bail to the respective Respondent No.2\nin each of the following Special Leave Petitions:\n\n• SLP (Crl.) No. 015156/2024 (Respondent No.2:\n\nOriginal Accused No.3, Smt. Tara Bano, mother-\nin-law of the deceased),\n\n• SLP (Crl.) No. 11355/2024 (Respondent No.2:\n\nOriginal Accused No.2, Mukhtar Ahmad, father-\nin-law of the deceased),\n\n• SLP (Crl.) No. 015157/2024 (Respondent No.2:\n\nOriginal Accused No.5, Ayasha Khan, sister-in-\nlaw of the deceased),\n\n• SLP (Crl.) No. 015158/2024 (Respondent No.2:\n\nOriginal Accused No.4, Saba, sister-in-law of the\ndeceased).\n\nSince the factual matrix is the same for all of\nthese cases, these appeals are being considered\ntogether for disposal.\n\n3. The Appellant’s case arises from FIR\nNo. 0032/2024 registered at Police Station\nKotwali Nagar, District Sultanpur, Uttar\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 2 of 16\n\nPradesh, for alleged offences punishable under\n\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\nof the Indian Penal\nCode1, along with\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry\nProhibition Act, 1961. This FIR was lodged on\n23.01.2024 by the Appellant (the brother of the\ndeceased, Ms. Shahida Bano). It states that\nShahida was married on 07.02.2022 to Accused\nNo.1, Sami Khan (husband of the deceased).\nShortly after the marriage, the family members of\nher matrimonial home- namely, Accused No.2\n(Mukhtar Ahmad, father-in-law), Accused No.3\n(Tara Bano, mother-in-law), Accused No.4 (Saba,\nsister-in-law), and Accused No.5 (Ayasha, sister-\nin-law), began demanding additional dowry.\n\n4. According to the FIR, the in-laws first demanded\na “Bullet” motorcycle, which the Appellant\nultimately provided in the name of the deceased.\nThereafter, they allegedly demanded a car, but\nthe Appellant, due to financial constraints,\nsought additional time. It is alleged that because\nthese dowry demands were not completely met,\nthe deceased was subjected to continuous\nIn short, “\nIPC\n”\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 3 of 16\n\nharassment and cruelty by Accused Nos.2, 3, 4,\nand 5, as well as by her husband (Accused No.1),\nwho resided abroad at the relevant time.\n\n5. The FIR further recounts that on 22.01.2024,\naround 6:15 p.m., the father of the Appellant\nreceived a phone call from Accused No.2\n(Mukhtar Ahmad/father-in-law) asking him to\ncome immediately. When the Appellant, his\nfather, mother, and other relatives reached the\nmatrimonial home, they allegedly found the\ndeceased’s body with a dupatta around her neck,\ntied to the ceiling fan, and her knees still resting\non the bed. On being informed, the local police\narrived, took photographs, and recorded the\noccurrence in the General Diary.\n\n6. A Post Mortem was conducted on 23.01.2024 by\na panel of doctors. The report documented\nmultiple ante-mortem injuries, including\ntraumatic contusions on the head and neck, as\nwell as a prominent ligature mark around the\nneck. Crucially, the cause of death was recorded\nas “Asphyxia due to ante-mortem strangulation,”\nsuggesting forced strangulation and ruling out\nsuicide.\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 4 of 16\n\n7. In the course of investigation statements under\n\nSection 161\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973,\nwere recorded, of the Appellant, the deceased’s\nfather, and various witnesses. They consistently\nalleged that Accused Nos.2, 3, 4, and 5, in concert\nwith Accused No.1, collectively harassed, beat,\nand eventually killed the deceased for dowry.\nBased on these statements and the medical\nevidence, the learned Sessions Judge noted the\ngravity of the offence, the unnatural death within\nseven years of marriage, and the specific\nallegations of dowry-related cruelty, and\ntherefore rejected the bail applications filed by\nthe Respondent-accused.\n\n8. Aggrieved by the Sessions Court’s denial of bail,\nAccused Nos.2, 3, 4, and 5 approached the High\nCourt of Judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow\nBench). By separate orders dated 07.05.2024,\n21.05.2024, 19.04.2024, and 04.04.2024,\nrespectively, the High Court granted bail to the\naforementioned respondents, primarily citing\nfactors such as the accused having no prior\ncriminal history, some of them being women, and\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 5 of 16\n\nthe fact that certain co-accused had already been\ngranted bail.\n\n9. Challenging the said bail orders, the Appellant\nhas approached this Court through the present\nSpecial Leave Petitions, contending that the High\nCourt erred in overlooking substantial material\nindicating the involvement of Accused Nos.2, 3, 4,\nand 5 in the alleged offence.\n\n10. We have heard learned counsel for the Appellant\nand the Respondents at length. The issue for\nconsideration before us is whether the impugned\norders granting bail to the Respondent Nos.2\n(Accused Nos.2, 3, 4, and 5) in these matters\ndeserve to be sustained or set aside in light of the\ngravity of the offence alleged and the material\navailable on record.\n\n11. At the outset, it is crucial to underscore the\nseriousness of an alleged dowry death under\n\nSections 498A\nand\n304B\nof the IPC, read with\n\nSections 3\nand\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act. In\nthe present case, the deceased had married\naccused no. 1 on 07.02.2022 and had died under\nhighly suspicious circumstances on 22.01.2024,\nwell within the seven-year window that invokes\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 6 of 16\n\nSection 304B\nof IPC. Her body was bearing\nmultiple ante-mortem injuries and a pronounced\nligature mark signifying strangulation. A closer\nlook at the post-mortem details reveals traumatic\ncontusions on the head and neck, indicating\nsevere physical violence prior to her demise.\nWhen such brutality is combined with a clear\npattern of dowry demands, including a “Bullet”\nmotorcycle initially and later a car, the possibility\nof a dowry-related killing becomes alarmingly\nevident. Stricter judicial scrutiny is necessary in\nmatters where a young woman loses her life in\nher matrimonial home so soon after marriage,\nparticularly where the record points to persistent\nharassment over unmet dowry demands.\n\n12. A further appraisal of the material on record\nsuggests that Accused No.2 (father-in-law) and\nAccused No.3 (mother-in-law) had a principal\nrole in pressurising the deceased with repeated\ndemands for expensive items and subjecting her\nto relentless cruelty. It emerges that the\ndeceased’s family did provide a motorcycle in her\nname, yet the demands continued to escalate,\nculminating in a demand for a car. Equally\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 7 of 16\n\nalarming is the fact that the deceased’s final\nmoments appear to have involved intense\nviolence, evidenced by multiple contusions and\ninjuries that are inconsistent with a mere case of\nsuicide. The father-in-law’s subsequent phone\ncall to the deceased’s parental home, urging\nthem to rush over, does not by itself exonerate\nhim; rather, when considered alongside the\nforensic and testimonial evidence, it casts further\ndoubt on the entire chain of events leading to the\nvictim’s death. In dowry-death cases, courts\nmust be mindful of the broader societal impact,\ngiven that the offence strikes at the very root of\nsocial justice and equality. Allowing alleged\nprime perpetrators of such heinous acts to\nremain on bail, where the evidence indicates they\nactively inflicted physical, as well as mental,\ntorment, could undermine not only the fairness\nof the trial but also public confidence in the\ncriminal justice system.\n\n13. In light of these concerns, we find that Accused\nNo.2 and Accused No.3 do not deserve the\ncontinued protection of bail. The gravity of the\nallegations, ranging from demands for costly gifts\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 8 of 16\n\nto the infliction of brutal injuries, demonstrates\na strong prima facie case against them. Moreover,\n\nSection 304B\nIPC (dowry death) prescribes a\nstringent standard because of the grave nature of\nthe offence and the systemic harm it perpetuates.\nWhere the facts clearly indicate direct\ninvolvement in the fatal events, courts must act\nwith an abundance of caution. Thus, permitting\nthe father-in-law and mother-in-law to remain at\nlarge would run counter to the ends of justice,\nespecially when the evidence reflects a probable\nnexus between their persistent dowry demands,\nphysical cruelty, and the deceased’s death.\nConsequently, their bail warrants cancellation so\nthat a fair and unimpeded trial may take place,\nin keeping with the legislative intent behind anti-\ndowry laws.\n\n14. As regards Accused No.4 (Saba) and Accused\nNo.5 (Ayasha) both sisters-in-law of the\ndeceased, the material on record does implicate\nthem, but their role appears relatively less direct.\nOne of them (Accused No.4) has recently got\nmarried (in November 2024) and begun her new\nlife, while the other (Accused No.5) is quite\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 9 of 16\n\nyoung, pursuing her education in Bachelor of\nArts degree and simultaneously employed as a\nteacher in a private school. Although we do not\nexonerate them from the allegations at this stage,\nwe find it appropriate to extend a measure of\nleniency towards them by not interfering with the\nbail granted. This consideration stems solely\nfrom their personal and educational\ncircumstances and should not be construed as a\nreflection on the merits of the allegations against\nthem.\n\n15. We also find it necessary to express our concern\nover the seemingly mechanical approach adopted\nby the High Court in granting bail to the\nRespondent accused. While the Court did note\nthe absence of prior criminal records, it failed to\nfully consider the stark realities of the\nallegations. It is unfortunate that in today’s\nsociety, dowry deaths remain a grave social\nconcern, and in our opinion, the courts are duty-\nbound to undertake deeper scrutiny of the\ncircumstances under which bail is granted in\nthese cases. The social message emanating from\njudicial orders in such cases cannot be\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 10 of 16\n\noverstated: when a young bride dies under\nsuspicious circumstances within barely two\nyears of marriage, the judiciary must reflect\nheightened vigilance and seriousness. A\nsuperficial application of bail parameters not\nonly undermines the gravity of the offence itself\nbut also risks weakening public faith in the\njudiciary’s resolve to combat the menace of dowry\ndeaths. It is this very perception of justice, both\nwithin and outside the courtroom, that courts\nmust safeguard, lest we risk normalizing a crime\nthat continues to claim numerous innocent lives.\nThese observations regarding grant of bail in\ngrievous crimes were thoroughly dealt with by\nthis Court in\nAjwar v. Waseem2\nin the following\nparas:\n\n“ 26. While considering as to whether\nbail ought to be granted in a matter\ninvolving a serious criminal offence, the\nCourt must consider relevant factors\nlike the nature of the accusations made\nagainst the accused, the manner in\nwhich the crime is alleged to have been\ncommitted, the gravity of the offence,\nthe role attributed to the accused, the\ncriminal antecedents of the accused,\n(2024) 10 SCC 768\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 11 of 16\n\nthe probability of tampering of the\nwitnesses and repeating the offence, if\nthe accused are released on bail, the\nlikelihood of the accused being\nunavailable in the event bail is granted,\nthe possibility of obstructing the\nproceedings and evading the courts of\njustice and the overall desirability of\nreleasing the accused on bail.

It is equally well settled that bail\nonce granted, ought not to be cancelled\nin a mechanical manner. However, an\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 12 of 16\n\nunreasoned or perverse order of bail is\nalways open to interference by the\nsuperior court. If there are serious\nallegations against the accused, even if\nhe has not misused the bail granted to\nhim, such an order can be cancelled by\nthe same Court that has granted the\nbail. Bail can also be revoked by a\nsuperior court if it transpires that the\ncourts below have ignored the relevant\nmaterial available on record or not\nlooked into the gravity of the offence or\nthe impact on the society resulting in\nsuch an order.\nIn\nP v. State of M.P. [P\nv.\nState of M.P., (2022) 15 SCC 211]\ndecided by a three-Judge Bench of this\nCourt [authored by one of us (Hima\nKohli, J.)] has spelt out the\nconsiderations that must weigh with\nthe Court for interfering in an order\ngranting bail to an accused under\n\nSection 439(1)\nCrPC in the following\nwords : (SCC p. 224, para 24)\n\n“24.\n\nAs can be discerned from the\nabove decisions, for cancelling bail\nonce granted, the court must\nconsider whether any\nsupervening circumstances have\narisen or the conduct of the\naccused post grant of bail\ndemonstrates that it is no longer\nconducive to a fair trial to permit\nhim to retain his freedom by\nenjoying the concession of bail\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 13 of 16\n\nduring trial [\nDolat Ram v. State of\nHaryana\n, (1995) 1 SCC 349 : 1995\nSCC (Cri) 237] . To put it\ndifferently, in ordinary\ncircumstances, this Court would\nbe loathe to interfere with an order\npassed by the court below\ngranting bail but if such an order\nis found to be illegal or perverse or\npremised on material that is\nirrelevant, then such an order is\nsusceptible to scrutiny and\ninterference by the appellate\ncourt.”\n\nConsiderations for setting aside bail\norders\n\n28. The considerations that weigh with\nthe appellate court for setting aside the\nbail order on an application being\nmoved by the aggrieved party include\nany supervening circumstances that\nmay have occurred after granting relief\nto the accused, the conduct of the\naccused while on bail, any attempt on\nthe part of the accused to procrastinate,\nresulting in delaying the trial, any\ninstance of threats being extended to\nthe witnesses while on bail, any\nattempt on the part of the accused to\ntamper with the evidence in any\nmanner. We may add that this list is\nonly illustrative and not exhaustive.\nHowever, the court must be cautious\nthat at the stage of granting bail, only a\n\nCrl.A.@SLP(Crl.)No.15156 of 2024 etc. Page 14 of 16\n\nprima facie case needs to be examined\nand detailed reasons relating to the\nmerits of the case that may cause\nprejudice to the accused, ought to be\navoided. Suffice it is to state that the\nbail order should reveal the factors that\nhave been considered by the Court for\ngranting relief to the accused.”\n\n16. We clarify that our present observations are\nlimited to deciding whether the bail of each\nAccused is liable to be cancelled. The trial court\nshall proceed on its own assessment of evidence,\nuninfluenced by any of the remarks made herein.\n\n17. In view of the discussion above, we direct that the\nbail granted to Accused No.2 (father-in-law) and\nAccused No.3 (mother-in-law) is hereby\ncancelled. They shall surrender before the\nconcerned trial court/authority forthwith, failing\nwhich the authorities shall take steps to take\nthem into custody.\n\n18. The bail granted to Accused No.4 (Saba) and\nAccused No.5 (Ayasha) is upheld.
