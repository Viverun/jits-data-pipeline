KUMAR, J.\n\n1. The instant petition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\n\nhas been filed by the Income Tax Inspectors belonging to the\n\nGeneral category, against the orders dated 11.12.2008 (P-6) and\n\n7.5.2009 (P-9) passed by the Chandigarh Bench of the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal (for brevity, 'the Tribunal'), in OA No. 519-\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 2\n\nPB-2007 and RA No. 24 of 2009 respectively. The Tribunal has\n\nissued directions for consideration of the cases of the Income Tax\n\nInspectors belonging to Scheduled Caste category for promotion to\n\nthe posts of Income Tax Officer on the basis of their 'own merit'\n\nresulting in consumption of General category posts as against the\n\nroster point promotion, relaxed qualification promotion and other\n\nconcessions. The necessary consequence is shrinking of General\n\ncategory seats for the inspectors belonging to General category and\n\nmore posts becoming available to Schedule Caste category. The\n\nTribunal has issued directions for consideration of their cases with\n\neffect from 11.6.1995 when 85th amendment of the Constitution\n\ncame into operation.\n\n2. Sarvshri Jarnail Singh, Balbir Singh and Som Parkash-\n\nrespondent Nos. 1 to 3, who belong to the reserved category of\n\nScheduled Caste, and working as Income Tax Inspectors filed O.A.\n\nNo. 519-PB-2007 before the Tribunal with a prayer for quashing\n\ncircular/order dated 5.7.2007 (P-1). It was vide circular and order\n\ndated 5.7.2007 that an eligibility list of Income Tax Inspectors was\n\ncirculated, who were to be considered for promotion to the cadre of\n\nIncome Tax Officer for the relevant year 2007-08, after their\n\nclearance by vigilance. The applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3\n\nclaimed that as a result of the proceedings held by the\n\nDepartmental Promotion Committees from 1997 to December,\n\n2006, no candidate belonging to Scheduled Caste category was\n\npromoted by complying with the rule of reservation. All the\n\nScheduled Caste category candidates who had been promoted were\n\nthose persons who got promotion on the basis of their own merit-\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 3\n\ncum-seniority and not on account of grant of benefit of reservation.\n\nReferring to OM No. 36028/17/2001Estt (Res.), dated 11.7.2002\n\n(R-1), the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3 agitated before the\n\nTribunal that they had to be adjusted against unreserved roster\n\npoints belonging to General category post and then the roster\n\npoints meant for reserved candidates are required to be filled up\n\nfrom amongst the candidates belonging to reserved categories. In\n\ncase, this exercise is carried out then applicant-respondent Nos. 1\n\nto 3 were likely to be benefited. Prior to filing of the original\n\napplication, the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3 sought\n\ninformation regarding proceedings of the DPC for promotion of\n\nIncome Tax Officers held during the years 1997 to 11.12.2006 as\n\nwell as copies of the panels. Those were accordingly supplied to\n\nthem on 11.6.2007 and 25.4.2007 (P-2 and P-3). From the said\n\ninformation the following facts and data is revealed:-\n\n\"Total Strength of ITO working in 322\n\nNorth West Region\n\nName and Total No. of ITO belonging 59*\nTo SC Category working at present\n\n[*The list does not include 3 SC category officers who\nwere promoted as own Merit candidates.]\"\n\n3. It has further been stated by the applicant-respondent\n\nNos. 1 to 3 that as per proceedings of the meeting dated\n\n12.11.2006, the sanctioned strength of ITOs were raised to 329.\n\nAgainst 46 roster points, 62 points were being occupied by\n\ncandidates belonging to Scheduled Caste category, which also\n\nincludes 3 SC category officers who were promoted as per their own\n\nmerit/seniority. In this manner, only 59 SC candidates were\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 4\n\nworking in the department against reserved points, which was in\n\nexcess of the prescribed quota for SC category. In para 3(ix) of the\n\nOA, the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3 have also furnished the\n\ndetail of candidates who were selected on the basis of their 'own\n\nmerit' during the period from July 1997 to October 2000. They\n\nclaimed that out of 42 SC candidates, 20 SC candidates were\n\npromoted to the posts of ITO on the basis of their 'own merit' and\n\nwithout granting any relaxation in respect of qualification etc.\n\nbecause they had cleared the ITO Examination with standard\n\nprescribed for General category. The applicant-respondent Nos. 1\n\nto 3 also filed representations dated 7.12.2006 (P-4) and 20.7.2007\n\n(P-5) asserting that the SC category candidates who got their\n\npromotion as per their own merit must be held to have consumed\n\nthe posts belonging to General category and promotion of\n\nadditional SC candidates as per their quota is required to be\n\nordered.\n\n4. In the written statement filed on behalf of the official\n\nrespondents the stand taken before the Tribunal was that eligibility\n\nlist of Income Tax Inspectors was prepared by including those\n\ncandidates who were eligible in terms of the recruitment rules and\n\nwho were within the zone of consideration. The list included those\n\nofficials who were having three years of service and who had\n\nqualified the Departmental Examination for Income Tax Officers. It\n\nhas been asserted that there was already excess representation of\n\nScheduled Caste category candidates as against the prescribed\n\nroster points and, hence, there was no need to extend the zone of\n\nconsideration. The concept of 'Own Merit' was introduced in\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 5\n\npromotion vide O.M. No. 36028/17/2001-Estt.(Res.), dated\n\n11.7.2002 (R-1). Another O.M. No. 36028/17/2001-Estt.(Res.),\n\ndated 31.1.2005 (R-2) was issued clarifying that the O.M. dated\n\n11.7.2002 would be effective from the date of its issue.\n\nControverting the claim of the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3, it\n\nhas been submitted that the reservation has been provided to\n\nScheduled Caste category candidates as per the instructions issued\n\nby the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).\n\n5. In reply to para 3(ix) of the OA it has been highlighted\n\nthat out of 20 officials named by the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to\n\n3, as many as 14 officials were promoted in the DPCs held prior to\n\nthe issuance of the instructions dated 11.7.2002. For becoming\n\neligible for promotion to the post of Income Tax Officer, the official\n\nis required to qualify the Departmental Examination for Income Tax\n\nInspector for confirmation in that cadre. With regard to the officers\n\npointed out by the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3, it has been\n\nstated that Smt. Ritu Wariah had qualified the Departmental\n\nExamination for Income Tax Inspectors with relaxed standards,\n\ntherefore, she was not considered as 'own merit' candidate for\n\npromotion to the post of Income Tax Officer. The remaining\n\nofficers, who were promoted in DPCs held subsequent to the\n\nissuance of instructions dated 11.7.2002 on the basis of 'own\n\nmerit', it has been pointed out that they were promoted by\n\nextending them the benefit of relaxed standards in qualifying the\n\nDepartmental Examination as under:-\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 6\n\nSr. Name of the Subject (Marks) and year in which benefit\nNo. Officers of Relaxed Standard\n\n1. Baldev Raj Book Keeping (55) in the year 1996\n\n2. Ishar Dass LT (88) in the year 1996\n\n3. Ramji Dass OT (54) in the year 1994\n\n4. Roshan Lal OT (55) in the year 1994\n\n5. Gurcharan Singh BK (56) in the year 1996\n\n6. It has been submitted that out of 20 candidates who\n\naccording to the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3 were to be\n\ntreated as 'own merit' candidates, 14 candidates were promoted in\n\nthe DPCs, which were held prior to the issuance of instructions\n\ndated 11.7.2002 and 6 candidates, who were promoted in DPCs\n\nheld after issuance of instructions, had availed the benefit of\n\nrelaxed standards. Therefore, those 20 candidates could not be\n\ntreated as 'own merit' candidates.\n\n7. In the rejoinder, the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3\n\nurged before the Tribunal that there was a shortage of 46 posts of\n\nITO belonging to SC category upto the date of DPC held on\n\n23.12.2005 and 49 were short in the category of SC at the time of\n\nDPC on 9.8.2007 on the basis of post based roster system.\n\nAccording to them, total 430 candidates were promoted to the post\n\nof ITO during the years 1996 to 2007. DPC proceedings were held\n\non 23.4.1996, 11.11.1997, 13.11.2000, 18.6.2001, 15.1.2003,\n\n4.12.2003, 15.7.2004, 28.10.2004, 7.4.2005, 4.10.2005,\n\n23.12.2005, 18.7.2006, 11.12.2006 and 9.8.2007. It has also been\n\nsubmitted that a review DPC was held on 10.2.2003 reviewing DPCs\n\nheld on 11.11.1997, 13.11.2000 and 18.6.2001. Out of 430\n\ncandidates promoted to the posts of ITO, 80 candidates belonging\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 7\n\nto Schedule Caste category were promoted as per their own\n\nseniority-cum-fitness and only two SC candidates, namely, Shri\n\nHans Raj and Shri Ram Dass Banga, were promoted as ITOs by\n\ngiving benefits of relaxed standard following the rule of reservation,\n\nas per the DPC held on 23.4.1996.\n\n8. It has further been submitted that once the posts\n\nearmarked for the reserved categories as per roster are filled up\n\nthen the reservation is complete. The roster cannot operate any\n\nfurther and it should be stopped. Any post falling vacant, in a cadre\n\nthereafter, is to be filled up by promoting a person of that category\n\nwho have caused the vacancy be it General, Scheduled Caste or\n\nScheduled Tribe. According to the applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3\n\nthe concept of 'own merit' relates back to 10.2.1995 when 5-Judge\n\nBench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court issued comprehensive\n\ndirections in the case of\nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab,\nPunjab\n, (1995) 2\n\nSCC 745.\n9. The official respondents also filed additional affidavit\n\ndated 20.11.2008 and reiterated the position qua vacancy based\n\nroster being converted to post based roster as also the factum of\n\nissuance of instructions dated 2.7.1997, 11.7.2002 and 31.1.2005.\n\n10. On 11.12.2008, the Tribunal allowed the O.A. filed by the\n\napplicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3 holding that the instructions dated\n\n2.7.1997 were modified by the instructions dated 11.7.2002 (R-1),\n\nwhich are clarificatory in nature and, therefore, would relate back to\n\nthe date of issuance, namely, 2.7.1997. On that basis, the Tribunal\n\nhas held that w.e.f. 2.7.1997 all members of the reserved category\n\nare required to be promoted whether on reserved roster point or on\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 8\n\ntheir 'own merit' which would consume General category vacancies,\n\nleaving reserved roster point post for other members of the SC\n\ncategory candidates, who may not make the grade on merit. The\n\nTribunal further held that the stand of the official respondents\n\nconcerning excess representation of the SC/ST candidates on the\n\nbasis of post based roster is mis-conceived. The concept of 'own\n\nmerit' is applicable since 1995 when the judgment in\nR.K.\n\nSabharwal\n's case (supra) was delivered. Accordingly, the Tribunal\n\nhas issued mandamus to the official respondents for\n\nreconsideration of promotions with further directions that if on\n\nverification, it is found that the seniority list and the SC roster\n\nregister is incorrect and that the representation of the SC category\n\nis less than the prescribed quota, then the official respondents\n\nwould fill up the backlog of SC category according to their seniority\n\non qualifying the departmental examination and further promotions\n\nof the persons belonging to the SC category to the posts of Income\n\nTax Officer would be made from the due date with all consequential\n\nbenefits. However, while doing so, persons likely to be affected\n\nwould be afforded an opportunity of being heard in the matter.\n\n11. On 21.1.2009, the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax-\n\nrespondent No. 6 prepared a list of the officials to be considered for\n\npromotion in the cadre of ITO and forwarded the same to the\n\nconcerned Chief Commissioner of Income Tax for securing\n\nclearance from Vigilance department in respect of the said officials\n\n(P-10).\n\n12. The petitioners, who belong to the General category,\n\nwere not impleaded as party respondents in the Original Application\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 9\n\nbefore the Tribunal. Aggrieved by the orders dated 11.12.2008,\n\npassed by the Tribunal at their back, the petitioners had earlier filed\n\nCWP No. 4537 of 2009, which was disposed of by a Division Bench\n\nof this Court on 23.3.2009 (P-7) giving liberty to them to file a\n\nreview application before the Tribunal highlighting their grievances.\n\nTheir grievance was that they have not been heard and that they\n\nwere necessary parties before the Tribunal.\n\n13. The petitioners then filed review application bearing R.A.\n\nNo. 24 of 2009 in O.A. No. 519/PB/2007. The Tribunal dismissed the\n\nreview application vide its order dated 7.5.2009. The petitioners\n\nhave also challenged the order dated 7.5.2009 in the instant\n\npetition. Their grievance is that instructions dated 11.7.2002 (R-1)\n\nfail to satisfy the mandatory pre-conditions before making\n\nreservation. It has been emphasised on the basis of Supreme Court\n\njudgments that - (a) an exercise is required to be undertaken by the\n\ncompetent authorities of the Union of India to conclude that there\n\nare compelling reasons for reservation concerning backwardness of\n\nScheduled Caste category which would warrant grant of promotion\n\nto the members of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes; and (b)\n\ngrant of promotion to them would not in any way adversely affect\n\nthe administrative efficiency and working of the office. Primarily,\n\nthe plea has been raised that no such survey has been carried out\n\nand the instructions dated 11.7.2002 have been issued without any\n\nbasis, which is against the mandate of law as incorporated by\n\nArticle 16(4A)\nand interpreted by a Constitution Bench of Hon'ble\n\nthe Supreme Court in the case of\nM. Nagaraj v. Union of India,\nIndia\n,\n\n(2006) 8 SCC 212.\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 10\n\n14. It is pertinent to mention that after hearing the\n\narguments the judgment was reserved vide order dated 20.7.2010.\n\nHowever, before the judgment could be pronounced, The Director,\n\nMinistry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department\n\nof Personnel and Training, Government of India issued an office\n\nmemorandum dated 10.8.2010 (P-16) on the issue concerning\n\nreservation in promotion and treatment of SC/ST candidates\n\npromoted on their 'own merit', which reads thus:\n\n\" The undersigned is directed to refer to this\n\nDepartment's O.M. No. 36028/17/2001-Estt (Res.) dated\n\n11th July 2002 which clarified that SC/ST candidates\n\nappointed by promotion on their own merit and not\n\nowing to reservation or relaxation of qualifications will be\n\nadjusted against unreserved points of the reservation\n\nroster and not against reserved points. It was\n\nsubsequently clarified by the Department's O.M. No.\n\n36028/17/2001-Estt.(Res.) dated 31.1.2005 that the\n\nabove referred O.M. took effect from 11.7.2002 and that\n\nthe concept of own merit did not apply to the promotions\n\nmade by non-selection method.\n\n2. Central Administrative Tribunal Madras Bench in\n\nO.A. No. 900/2005 (\nS. Kalugasalamoorthy V/S Union of\n\nIndia and others\n) has set aside the O.M. No.\n\n36928/17/2001-Estt. (Res.) dated 31.1.2005 and held\n\nthat when a person is selected on the basis of his own\n\nseniority, the scope of considering and counting him\n\nagainst quota reserved for SCs does not arise.\n\nThe High\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 11\n\nCourt of judicature at Madras in the matter of\nUOI V/S S.\n\nKalugasalamoorthy (WP No.\n15926 of 2007) has upheld\n\nthe decision of the Central Administrative Tribunal.\n\n3. The matter has been examined in the light of the\n\nabove referred judgments and it has been decided to\n\nwithdraw O.M. No. 36028/17/2001 Estt (Res.) dated\n\n31.1.2005\nreferred to above\n. It is clarified that SC/ST\n\ncandidates appointed by promotion on their own merit\n\nand seniority and not owing to reservation or relaxation\n\nof qualifications will be adjusted against unreserved\n\npoints of reservation roster, irrespective of the fact\n\nwhether the promotion is made by selection method or\n\nnon-selection method. These orders will take effect from\n\n2.7.1997 on the dated on which post based reservation\n\nwas introduced.\n\n4. These instructions may be brought to the notice of\n\nall concerned.\"\n\n15. It is obvious that the said office memorandum has been\n\nissued in purported compliance of the order passed by the Madras\n\nBench of the Tribunal, passed in O.A. No. 900/2005, withdrawing\n\nthe earlier office memorandum dated 31.1.2005. The office\n\nmemorandum dated 10.8.2010 (P-16) has also clarified that the\n\nSC/ST candidates appointed by promotion on their 'own merit and\n\nseniority' and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\n\nqualifications would be adjusted against unreserved points of\n\nroster, irrespective of the fact whether the promotion is made by\n\nselection method or non-selection method. The said clarification\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 12\n\nhas been made effective retrospectively w.e.f. 2.7.1997 when the\n\npost based reservation was introduced.\n\n16. In order to bring on record the office memorandum\n\ndated 10.8.2010 and to challenge the same either by filing a\n\nseparate petition or by amending the pending petition a request\n\nwas made. Accordingly, the Registry was directed to list the matter\n\nfor re-hearing. Thereafter, the instant petition was amended by the\n\npetitioners after due permission of this Court.\n\n17. Mr. Rajiv Atma Ram, learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nhas argued that the Original Application in the instant case was\n\nfiled on 9.7.2007 and no order passed beyond the period of 1½\n\nyears, as postulated by\nSection 21\nof the Central Administrative\n\nTribunals Act, 1985, could have been challenged. The submission is\n\nthat the OA is badly hit by the delay and laches. Therefore, it\n\nsuffers from the statutory bar created by\nSection 21\nof the said Act.\n\nMr. Atma Ram also urged that the original applicant-respondents\n\nbecame eligible for promotion to the post of ITO on 4.12.2004,\n\n13.8.2004 and 24.12.2004 after completing three years minimum\n\nservice on the post of Inspector and after passing the departmental\n\nexamination. They could not have challenged any promotion made\n\nbefore acquiring eligibility by them.\nIn support of his submission,\n\nlearned counsel has placed reliance on the judgments of Hon'ble\n\nthe Supreme Court rendered in the cases of\nChattar Singh v. State\n\nof Rajasthan,\nRajasthan\n, AIR 1997 SC 303;\nRoshni Devi v. State of Haryana,\nHaryana\n, AIR\n\n1998 SC 3268 and Union of India v. N. Y. Apte,\nApte, AIR 1998 SC 2651.\n18. Learned counsel has also submitted that the order dated\n\n14.9.2007 (R-3) and dated 29.11.2007 (R-4), passed by the Deputy\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 13\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax have nowhere been challenged, which\n\nhas resulted in rendering the OA as infructuous.\nIn that regard,\n\nlearned counsel has placed reliance on the observations made in\n\npara 7 of the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nPiare Lal v. Union of India,\nIndia\n, AIR 1975 SC 650.\n\n650 He has further\n\nsubmitted that the option to amend the OA, which was available to\n\nthe Original Applicants, has not been availed either before the\n\nTribunal or before this Court. Therefore, the OA should have been\n\ndismissed as having been rendered infructuous.\n\n19. According to the learned counsel the view taken by the\n\nTribunal holding that there was no necessity to challenge office\n\norders dated 14.9.2007 and 29.11.2007 (R-3 and R-4) is erroneous\n\nbecause these orders have taken the same view which was pleaded\n\nbefore the Tribunal in the written statement filed by the official\n\nrespondents. Mr. Atma Ram contended that even a void order has\n\nto be necessarily challenged as has been held by Hon'ble the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nState of Punjab v. Gurdev Singh,\nSingh, JT\n\n1991 (3) SC 465.\n\n465 In any case, the petitioners, who belongs to\n\nGeneral category, were necessary parties before the Tribunal, as for\n\nmaking appointment on the basis of 'Own merit' of the candidate\n\nbelonging to SC/ST category could have been possible only after\n\nreplacing the General Category candidate. They would face\n\nreversion or would be on the road otherwise. Another limb of the\n\nargument is that the Tribunal has adopted absolutely unwarranted\n\napproach by saying that the petitioners were to be heard by the\n\nauthorities while implementing the judgment.\n\n20. Learned counsel has also relied upon the observations of\n\nHon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra).\n\n(supra)\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 14\n\nAccording to the learned counsel the power to make reservation\n\nmust be preceded by an exercise which is to be undertaken in\n\nrespect of each cadre of each department to show that there are\n\ncompelling reasons on account of backwardness to make\n\nreservation, inadequacy of representation of such class keeping in\n\nmind the overall administrative efficiency in public administration.\n\nIn that regard he has drawn our attention to the averments made in\n\npara 19 of the writ petition and reply to corresponding para 19 of\n\nthe written statement of respondent Nos. 4 and 5 as well as the\n\nprivate respondents. It has been specifically averred that no\n\nexercise was undertaken for making reservation reach to a definite\n\nconclusion that there are compelling reasons of backwardness of\n\nScheduled Castes and showing inadequacy of representation.\nIn\n\norder to support his submission, learned counsel has placed\n\nreliance on paras 103 to 108 and paras 114 to 118 and 122 of the\n\njudgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in\nM. Nagaraj\n's case\n\n(supra).\n\n(supra)\n\n21. Mr. Rajiv Atma Ram has also argued that 'own merit'\n\ninstructions concerning promotion have been issued for the first\n\ntime on 11.7.2002 and specifically confined to operate\n\nprospectively vide letter dated 31.1.2005 (R-2). Therefore, the\n\nTribunal could not have issued directions for operating these\n\ninstructions with a retrospective date i.e. from 17.6.1995 when the\n\n85th amendment was brought into effect. He has further submitted\n\nthat even otherwise a general principle of law has to prevail that\n\nexecutive instructions can never operate retrospectively, as has\n\nbeen held by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of\nSant Ram v.\n\nState of Rajasthan,\nRajasthan\n, AIR 1967 SC 1910.\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 15\n\n22. Learned counsel then argued that even if the instructions\n\nare made applicable, the Tribunal has miserably failed to consider\n\nthe concept of 'Own Merit Promotion'. In the light of the factual\n\nposition of the present case, the respondents who were the Original\n\nApplicants before the Tribunal, could not have claimed the benefit\n\nof the instructions because they have either been given 2-3\n\npromotions on the roster point or have been granted relaxation in\n\nqualification like securing of marks etc.\nIn support of his\n\nsubmission learned counsel has placed reliance on two judgments\n\nof Hon'ble the Supreme Court rendered in the cases of\nUnion of\n\nIndia v. Satya Prakash,\nPrakash\n, 2006(3) SLR 56 and Jitender Singh v. State of\n\nU.P.,\nU.P., JT 2010 (1) SC 177.\n\n177 In any case, the instructions itself\n\npostulate the aforesaid situation.\n\n23. He has also referred to the affidavit of the Deputy\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax in the form of written statement.\n\nAccording to sub-para IX and X of para 4, the details of various\n\nofficers have been given with further clarification whether they\n\nhave availed promotion on roster point by relaxed standard. The\n\naforesaid position was not disputed by the respondents in their\n\nrejoinder dated 6.3.2008 filed before the Tribunal (P-3). The\n\ncorresponding para of the rejoinder merely reads that the contents\n\nof the written statement filed by the department are denied being\n\nincorrect and those of the petition were reiterated. Even in the\n\npreliminary submissions, there is no rebuttal to the aforesaid\n\naverments made by the deponent in the written statement. In\n\nEntry No. 720 of 2008, merely roster register has been placed on\n\nrecord, which constituted the basis for the observation made by the\n\nTribunal that the members belonging to reserved category have not\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 16\n\nbeen adequately represented. The aforesaid is the legislative\n\nfunction and could not have been undertaken by the Tribunal.\n\nLearned counsel has also relied upon the following judgments on\n\n'Own Merit Promotion':\n\nUday Pratap Singh v. State of Bihar,\nBihar, JT 1994 (6) SC 344;\n\nUnion of India v. Satya Parkash,\nParkash, JT\n2006 (3) SLR 56;\n\nJitender Singh v. State of U.P.,\nU.P., JT 2010 (1) SC 177;\n\nUnion of India v. Ramesh Ram,\nRam, JT\n2010 (5) SC 212;\n\nUnion of India v. Bharat Bhushan,\nBhushan\n, 2008 (7) AC (Delhi) 420\n\n24. Mr. Atma Ram has raised another issue, namely, that the\n\nappointment/promotions made long years ago cannot now be\n\nunsettled. He has pointed out that the petitioners were promoted\n\nfourteen years ago on the post of Income Tax Officers i.e. in the\n\nyear 1996 and, therefore, the settled promotions on equitable\n\nconsideration should not be reopened. In support of the\n\nsubmission, learned counsel has placed reliance on a Full Bench\n\njudgment of this Court rendered in the case of Krishna Gopal v.\n\nHaryana,, 2010 (1) SCT 538 and a judgment of Hon'ble the\nState of Haryana\n\nSupreme Court rendered in the case of\nRoshni Devi v. State of\n\nHaryana,\nHaryana\n, (1998) 8 SCC 59.\n\n59.\n\n25. Learned counsel has then argued that office\n\nMemorandum dated 10.8.2010 (P-16) purported to have been\n\nissued by the Government of India, Ministry of Personnel, Public\n\nGrievances and Pension, in fact, has been issued by the Director as\n\nis evident from the perusal of the aforesaid document. According\n\nto the learned counsel the business of the Government is required\n\nto be transacted in the manner postulated by the statutory rules\n\nframed under\nArticle 77(3)\nof the Constitution, which are known as\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 17\n\n'Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 (for\n\nbrevity, 'the Transaction of Business Rules'). The aforesaid rules\n\nhave also been placed on record (P-17). It has been emphasised\n\nthat according to Rule 3 of the Transaction of Business Rules,\n\ndisposal of business by Ministries has to be in consultation with\n\nother departments and submission of cases to the Prime Minister,\n\nthe Cabinet and its Committees, and the President. All business\n\nallotted to a department under the Government of India (Allocation\n\nof Business) Rules, 1961 (for brevity, 'the Allocation of Business\n\nRules') must be disposed of by or under the general of special\n\ndirections of the Minister-in-charge. The argument is that as per\n\nRule 4 of the Transaction of Business Rules inter-departmental\n\nconsultations would be necessary where more than one department\n\nis involved. Learned counsel has drawn our attention to para 35(i)\n\nand (ii) where specific averments have been made that office\n\nmemorandum dated 10.8.2010 has not been issued in accordance\n\nwith and in furtherance of the Transaction of Business Rules. The\n\nwritten statement filed by respondent Nos. 5 and 6 (by the Union of\n\nIndia and Chief Commissioner of Income-tax) to the aforesaid\n\naverments would show that the assertion concerning incompetence\n\nof the Director to issue such an order has not been controverted.\n\nLikewise, the written statement filed by respondent Nos. 2 and 3\n\nhas also been read out to us showing that categorical averments\n\nmade in para 35 by the petitioners have not been controverted,\n\ninsofar as, the competence of the Director to issue such\n\nmemorandum is concerned. Referring to the stand taken by\n\nrespondent Nos. 2 and 3 on the basis of the Allocation of Business\n\nRules, learned counsel has pointed out that the said Rules (R-2/2)\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 18\n\nonly talks of allocation of business but the manner in which the\n\nbusiness is to be transacted is clarified by the Transaction of\n\nBusiness Rules (P-17). The submission in nutshell is that the\n\nexecutive power by virtue of\nArticle 73\nof the Constitution vests\n\nonly in the Government and not in the Director who is merely an\n\nofficial of the Government. Accordingly, it has been submitted that\n\nthere is neither any express delegation under\nArticle 77\nof the\n\nConstitution to any of the officers of the Government much less a\n\nDirector.\n\n26. The other submission made by Mr. Atma Ram is that in\n\nany case the office memorandum dated 10.8.2010, only at best is\n\nto be regarded as an executive order and it can operate\n\nprospectively and it cannot have any retrospective operation.\n\nAccording to the learned counsel executives have not been clothed\n\nwith the power to issue executive orders to have retrospective\n\neffect. In that regard reliance has been placed on a judgment of\n\nHon'ble the Supreme Court rendered in the case of Uday Pratap\n\nSingh v. State of Bihar,\nBihar, JT 1994 (6) SC 344.\n27. The principal stand taken by respondent Nos. 5 and 6,\n\nnamely, Union of India and the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax\n\nrespectively is that instructions dated 11.7.2002 are prospective\n\nand it first time recognises the principle of 'own merit promotion'.\n\nTherefore, it has been submitted that these instructions cannot be\n\nregarded as clarificatory of earlier instructions issued on 2.7.1997.\n\nAccordingly, it has been pleaded that the Tribunal cannot give\n\nretrospective effect to the instructions issued on 11.7.1996 or from\n\na date the amendment was made in the Constitution. In order to\n\nclarify the whole position, instructions dated 31.3.2005 have also\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 19\n\nbeen issued which categorically provide that instructions dated\n\n11.7.2002 are clarificatory in nature. It has, however, been\n\nadmitted in the reply to para 3 of the writ petition that the\n\nmembers of the General category were bound to be affected on\n\naccount of cancellation/quashing of their promotion order and that\n\nno member of the General category who is likely to be affected had\n\nbeen impleaded as party respondent before the Tribunal by the\n\nOriginal Applicant-respondent Nos. 1 to 3. It is only the official\n\nrespondent Nos. 5 and 6 who were made parties.\n\n28. Mr. A.S. Grewal and Ms. Renu Bala Sharma, adopts the\n\narguments which have been submitted in the reply of respondent\n\nNos. 5 and 6. Ms. Renu Bala Sharma has pointed out that in para\n\n(iii) of the letter dated 15.9.2010 (R-1) it has been stated that\n\nbefore issuing the office memorandum, the approval of the\n\nSecretary (Personnel) was obtained and, therefore, the argument\n\nthat the instructions have been issued by the Director would not\n\nstand the scrutiny of law and the office memorandum dated\n\n10.8.2010 has been issued by an authority who is competent to\n\nissue the same.\n\n29. The private respondent No. 1 also filed a reply and\n\nseparate written statement has been filed by private respondent\n\nNos. 2 and 3. Mr. M.K. Tiwari, learned counsel for respondent No. 1\n\nhas argued that the instructions dated 10.8.2010 cannot be\n\nchallenged before this Court as per the law laid down by Hon'ble\n\nthe Supreme Court in the case of Raj Kumar and others v. Hem Raj\n\nSingh Chauhan,\nChauhan, (2010) 4 SCC 554,\n554 and the only remedy is to file an\n\noriginal application before the Tribunal.\nIt has also been submitted\n\nby Mr. Tiwari that the writ petitioners belonging to General category\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 20\n\nhas no locus standi to file a review application against the order\n\ndated 11.12.2008 passed by the Tribunal because they were not\n\nparty to the litigation and they were not even affected persons as\n\nper the law laid down by Hon'ble the Supreme court in paras 14 and\n\n18 of the judgment rendered in the case of\nV.P. Shrivastava v. State\n\nof M.P.,\nM.P.\n, (1996) 7 SCC 759.\n\n759 Mr. Tiwari has argued that the\n\npetitioners are not necessary party as an effective order can always\n\nbe passed in their absence particularly when their interest has been\n\ntake care of by the Tribunal requiring the official respondents to\n\nissue notice before touching their rights. Mr. Tiwari has submitted\n\nthat the petitioners are junior to the private respondents and the\n\npresent writ petition is nothing but it is an abuse of the process of\n\nthe Court. The writ petition has been filed to delay the claim of the\n\nSC/ST candidates who have been denied their due claim of\n\npromotion to the post of Income-tax Officer for the last 16 years.\n\nSupporting the order of the Tribunal, Mr. Tiwari has submitted that\n\nas per the rules all the posts of Income Tax Officer are required to\n\nbe filled up as backlog of excess candidates has been continuing.\n\nHe has maintained that respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are the Income\n\nTax Inspectors and belong to SC category. They are eligible for\n\npromotion to the post of Income Tax Officer Grade-II on their own\n\nmerit without consuming the vacancies of SC/ST category.\n\n30. Similar stand has been taken in the similar reply filed by\n\nrespondent Nos. 2 and 3. However, Mr. Deepak Sibal has argued on\n\nthe basis the rules concerning Allocation of Business (R-2/2) that\n\nmemorandum dated 10.8.2010 has been issued by an authority\n\nwhich is fully competent because the approval of the Secretary\n\n(Personnel) was obtained.\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 21\n\n31. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and perusal\n\nof the paper book with their assistance, particularly the judgment of\n\nthe Tribunal, we are of the view that the most fundamental issue\n\nraised by the learned counsel for the petitioners needs to be\n\nanswered. It is well settled that all laws must take guidance from\n\nthe Constitution. The present case present decades old\n\ncontroversy whether the provision for reservation in promotion\n\ncould be made by the State/Union of India without imposing any\n\nconditions. The whole controversy was settled by a 9-Judge\n\nConstitution Bench of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney\n\nIndia,, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217.\n\nv. Union of India 217 In that case the\n\nConstitution Bench interpreted\nArticle 16(4)\nof the Constitution\n\nrelating to the State's power for making provision for reservation in\n\nappointments/posts in favour of any Backward Class of citizen,\n\nwhich in the opinion of the State was not adequately represented in\n\nservices of the State. Another principal question decided by the\n\nConstitution Bench in Indra Sawhney's case (supra) was whether\n\nsuch power is extended to making a provision on a promotional\n\npost. It was held that\nArticle 16(4)\ndid not permit provision for\n\nreservation in the matter of promotion. It was further held that\n\nsuch a rule was to be given effect only prospectively and would not\n\naffect the promotions already made whether on regular basis or\n\nany other basis. A direction was issued by the Constitution Bench\n\nthat wherever reservation is provided in the matter of promotion, it\n\nwas to continue for a period of five years from the date of the\n\njudgment and time was given to all the concerned authorities to\n\namend their rules within the aforesaid period. However, by virtue\n\nof the\nConstitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995\n,\nArticle\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 22\n\n16(4A)\nwas added stipulating that the State is not prevented from\n\nmaking any provision for reservation in matters of promotion in any\n\nclass or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of\n\nthe SC/ST which in their opinion are not adequately represented in\n\nthe services. The aforesaid amendment came up on 17.6.1995.\n\n32. Another question which was debated before Hon'ble the\n\nSupreme Court in the cases of\nUnion of India v. Virpal Singh\n\nChauhan,\nChauhan\n, (\n1995) 6) SCC 684 and Ajit Singh Januja v. State of Punjab,\nPunjab\n,\n\n(1996) 2 SCC 715,\n715 was as to whether the benefit of accelerated\n\npromotion through reservation on roster point would give such\n\npromotees seniority over his senior General category promotees\n\nalbeit promoted subsequently. In other words whether roster point\n\npromotee was entitled to retain his date of promotion as\n\nsacrosanct. The aforesaid principle became known as 'catch up\n\nprinciple'. In both the judgments it was held that the benefit of\n\naccelerated promotion through reservation or roster point would\n\nnot result into conferring seniority over and above General category\n\nsenior promotees who were promoted subsequently.\n\nA discordant\n\nnote was struck when a 3-Judge Bench took a contrary view in the\n\ncase of\nJagdish Lal v. State of Haryana,\nHaryana\n, (1997) 6 SCC 538.\n\n538 In the\n\naforesaid judgment Hon'ble the Supreme Court placed reliance on\n\nthe recruitment rules which provided for fixation of seniority\n\naccording to the length of continuous service on a post in the\n\nservice. The aforesaid view was overruled by the Constitution\n\nBench in the cases of Ajit Singh (II) v. State of Punjab,\nPunjab, (\n1999) 7 SCC\n\n209 and Ram Prasad v. D.K. Vijay,\nVijay\n, (1999) 7 SCC 251.\n\n251 The view\n\ntaken by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in its earlier judgments\n\nrendered in the cases of\nVirpal Singh Chauhan\n(supra) and\nAjit Singh\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 23\n\nJanuja\n(supra) was affirmed.\n\n33. The controversy was reopened when the Parliament\n\namended the Constitution on 4.1.2002 by brining in the\n\nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n, so as to restore\n\nthe benefit of consequential seniority to the reserved categories\n\nw.e.f. 17.6.1995. The 77th and 85th amendments were challenged\n\nbefore Hon'ble the Supreme Court and the matter was decided in\n\nthe case of\nM. Nagaraj\n(supra).\n\n(supra) The Constitution Bench upheld the\n\n77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th Amendment Acts and their retrospective\n\neffect. However, it proceeded to impose certain conditions.\nIn the\n\npresent case this Court is concerned with the conditions which are\n\ndiscernible from the perusal of following extracts of the judgment\n\nrendered in\nM. Nagaraj\n's case (supra):\n\n(supra)\n\n\" The Constitution Bench proceeded to\n\ndetermine the issues related to the:\n\nA. (i) validity, (ii) interpretation, and (iii)\n\nimplementation of the 77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th\n\nConstitution Amendment Acts; and,\n\nB. action taken in pursuance thereof which\n\nsought to reverse decisions of the Supreme\n\nCourt in matters relating to promotion in\n\npublic employment and their application with\n\nretrospective effect.\n\nThe key issue which arose for determination\n\nwas whether by virtue of the impugned constitutional\n\namendments, the power of Parliament was so enlarged\n\nso as to obliterate any or all of the constitutional\n\nlimitations and requirements. Answering the reference\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 24\n\nthe Supreme Court held that in the matter of application\n\nof the principle of basic structure, twin tests have to be\n\nsatisfied, namely, the \"width test\" and the test of\n\n\"identity\". The test for judging the width of the power\n\nand the test for adjudicating the exercise of power by\n\nthe State concerned are two different tests which\n\nwarrant two different judicial approaches.\n\nFirstly, it is the width of the power under the\n\nimpugned amendments introducing and amending\n\nArticles 16(4-A)\nand\n16(4-B)\nthat has to be tested.\n\nTherefore the \"width test\" has to be applied. The\n\nboundaries of the \"width\" of the power, namely, (1) the\n\nceiling limit of 50% (quantitative limitation), (2) the\n\nprinciple of creamy layer (qualitative exclusion), (3) the\n\ncompelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy\n\nof representation, and (4) the overall administrative\n\nefficiency are not obliterated by the impugned\n\namendments. The constitution limitation under\nArticle\nis relaxed and not obliterated. These impugned\n\namendments are confined only to SCs and STs and the\n\nsub-classification between OBCs on one hand and SCs\n\nand STs on the other hand as held in Indra Sawhney,\n\n1992 Supp (3) SCC 217, and the concept of post-based\n\nroster with inbuilt concept of replacement as held in R.K.\n\nSabharwal, (1995) 2 SCC 745, have also not been\n\nobliterated. (emphasis added)\n\nSecondly, applying the test of \"identity\" there\n\nis no alteration in the existing structure of the equality\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 25\n\ncode (\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\n) in the Constitution by the\n\nimpugned amendments. Equity, justice and efficiency\n\nare the limitations on the mode of the exercise of power\n\nby the State. None of these limitations have been\n\nremoved by the impugned amendments. None of the\n\naxioms like secularism, federalism, etc. which are\n\nunderlying principles have been violated by the\n\nimpugned constitution amendments. There is no\n\nviolation of the basic structure of the Constitution by any\n\nof the impugned amendments. The impugned\n\nconstitutional amendments by which\nArticles 16(4-A)\nand\n\n16(4-B)\nhave been inserted flow from\nArticle 16(4).\nThey\n\ndo not alter the structure of\nArticle 16(4).\n\nArticles 16(4-\n\nA) and 16(4-B) form a composite part of the scheme\n\nenvisaged and fall in the pattern of\nArticle 16(4)\n, and as\n\nlong as the parameters mentioned in those articles are\n\ncomplied with by the States, the provision of reservation\n\ncannot be faulted. They are curative by nature.\nArticle\n\n16(4)\nis enacted as a remedy for the past historical\n\ndiscriminations against a social class.\nArticles 16(4-A)\n\nand\n16(4-B)\nare both inspired by observations of the\n\nSupreme Court in Indra Sawhney, 1992 Supp (3) SCC\n\n217 and R.K. Sabharwal, (1995) 2 SCC 745. They have\n\nnexus with\nArticles 17\nand\nof the Constitution.\nArticles\n\n16(4-A)\nand\n16(4-B)\nare classifications within the\n\nprinciple of equality under\nArticle 16(4).\nTherefore, the\n\nclassification envisaged by\nArticles 16(4-B)\nis upheld.\n\nThirdly, every discretionary power is not\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 26\n\nnecessarily discriminatory. Equality is not violated by\n\nmere conferment of discretionary power. It is violated by\n\narbitrary exercise by those on whom it is conferred. This\n\nis the theory of \"guided power\". This theory is based on\n\nthe assumption that in the event of arbitrary exercise by\n\nthose on whom the power is conferred, the same would\n\nbe corrected by the courts. This is the basic principle\n\nbehind the enabling provisions which are incorporated in\n\nArticles 16(4-A)\nand\n16(4-B).\nThese enabling provisions\n\nare permissive in nature. They leave it to the States to\n\nprovide for reservation. If the appropriate Government\n\nenacts a law providing for reservation without keeping in\n\nmind the parameters in\nArticle 16(4)\nand\nArticle 335\nthen\n\nthe Supreme Court will certainly set aside and strike\n\ndown such legislation. The field of exercise of the\n\namending power is retained by the impugned\n\namendments, as the impugned amendments have\n\nintroduced merely enabling provisions because merit,\n\nefficiency, backwardness and inadequacy cannot be\n\nidentified and measured in a vacuum.\nArticles 16(4-A)\n\nand\n16(4-B)\nare enacted to balance equality with positive\n\ndiscrimination. Be it reservation or evaluation,\n\nexcessiveness in either would result in violation of the\n\nconstitutional mandate. This exercise, however, will\n\ndepend on facts of each case. The constitutional law is\n\nthe law of evolving concepts. Some of them are generic\n\nothers have to be identified and valued. The enabling\n\nprovisions of\nArticles 16(4-A)\nand\n16(4-B)\ndeal with the\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 27\n\nconcept, which has to be identified and valued as in the\n\ncase of access vis-a-vis efficiency which depends on the\n\nfact situation only and not abstract principle of equality\n\nin\nArticle 14\nas spelt out in detail in\narticles 15\nand\n16.\n\nEquality before the law, guaranteed by the first part of\n\nArticle 14\n, is a negative concept while the second part is\n\na positive concept which is enough to validate equalizing\n\nmeasures depending upon the fact situation. (emphasis\n\nadded)\n\nThe impugned provisions are enabling\n\nprovisions. The State is not bound to make reservation\n\nfor SCs/STs in matters of promotions. However, if they\n\nwish to exercise their discretion and make reservations\n\nin promotions, the States have to collect quantifiable\n\ndata showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy\n\nof representation of that class in public employment,\n\nkeeping in mind maintenance of efficiency, as indicated\n\nby\nArticle 335.\nThe concepts of efficiency,\n\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation are\n\nrequired to be identified and measured. That exercise\n\ndepends on availability of data. That exercise depends\n\non numerous factors. It is for this reason that enabling\n\nprovisions are required to be made because each\n\ncompeting claim seeks to achieve certain goals. How\n\nbest one should optimize these conflicting claims can\n\nonly be done by the administration in the context of\n\nprevailing local conditions in public employment. If the\n\nState concerned fails to identify and measure\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 28\n\nbackwardness, inadequacy and overall administrative\n\nefficiency then in that event the provision for reservation\n\nwould be invalid. Furthermore, it is made clear that even\n\nif the State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the\n\nState will have to see that its reservation provision does\n\nnot lead to excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling\n\nlimit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer exclusion\n\nrequirement or extend the reservation indefinitely.\n\nUltimately the present controversy is regarding the\n\nexercise of the power by the State Government, as to\n\nwhether the State concerned has identified and valued\n\nthe circumstances justifying it to make reservation.\n\nWhen the State fails to identify and implement the\n\ncontrolling factors then excessiveness comes in, and this\n\nhas to be decided on the facts of each case. In each\n\ncase the Court has got to be satisfied that the State has\n\nexercised its discretion in making reservations in\n\npromotions for SCs and STs and for which the State\n\nconcerned will have to place before the Court the\n\nrequisite quantifiable data in each case and satisfy the\n\nCourt that such reservations became necessary on\n\naccount of inadequacy of representation of SCs/STs in a\n\nparticular class or classes of posts without affecting\n\ngeneral efficiency of service as mandated under\nArticle\nof the Constitution. (emphasis added)\n\n34. Subject to the above limitations, the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the\nConstitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act,\n, the\nConstitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000\n, the\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 29\n\nConstitution (Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000\nand the\n\nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n, have been upheld\n\nin\nM. Nagaraj\n's case (supra).\n\n(supra) It has also been observed that the\n\ncompelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation and the overall administrative efficiency are all\n\nconstitutional requirements without which the structure of equality\n\nof opportunity in\nArticle 16\nwould collapse.\nArticle 16(4)\nenables a\n\nState to provide for reservation in cases where it is satisfied on\n\nbasis of quantifiable data that there exists backwardness of a class\n\nand inadequacy of representation in employment. Backwardness\n\nhas to be based on objective factors whereas inadequacy has to\n\nfactually exist. This is where judicial review comes in. However,\n\nwhether reservation in a given case is desirable or not, as a policy,\n\nis not for the Court to decide as long as the parameters mentioned\n\nin\nArticles 16(4)\nare maintained.\n\n35. On the question of necessity of quantifiable data it has\n\nbeen held that reservation is necessary for transcending caste and\n\nnot for perpetuating it. Reservations has to be used in a limited\n\nsense otherwise it will perpetuate casteism in the country. The\n\nextent of reservation depends on facts of each case and in this\n\nregard the State concerned would have to show in each case the\n\nexistence of backwardness, inadequacy of representation and\n\noverall administrative efficiency before making provision for\n\nreservation. If in a given case Court finds excessive reservation\n\nunder the State enactment then such an enactment would be liable\n\nto be struck down. The need to balance the context specific\n\nindependent variable requirements of equity, justice, and\n\nmerit/efficiency on the basis of quantifiable date in each case, the\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 30\n\nconflicting claim of individual rights under\nArticle 16(1)\nand the\n\npreferential treatment given to a Backward Class has to be\n\nbalanced. Therefore, in each case a contextual case has to be\n\nmade out depending on different circumstances which may exist\n\nStatewise and the problem has to be examined on the facts of each\n\ncase. Wheat needs to be found is a stable equilibrium between\n\njustice to the backwards, equity for the forwards and efficiency for\n\nthe entire system.\n\n36.\nIn paras72, 73, 79, 81 and 102 of the judgment in\nM.\n\nNagaraj\n's case (supra),\n(supra) their Lordships' have dealt with the 'catch-\n\nup' rule, which had been explained in detail in para 26 of the\n\njudgment in\nVirpal Singh Chauhan\n's case (supra).\n\n(supra) As per the 'catch-\n\nup' rule a reserved category candidate promoted on the basis of\n\nreservation earlier than his senior general category candidates in\n\nthe feeder grade, shall necessarily be junior in the promoted\n\ncategory to such general category candidates. The 'catch-up' rule\n\nis not imlicit in\nArticles 16(1)\nto (4). The concept of the 'catch-up'\n\nrule and 'consequential seniority' are not constitutional\n\nrequirements or limitations. They are judicially evolved concepts to\n\ncontrol the extent of reservation, derived from service\n\njurisprudence. They are not constitutional principles so as to be\n\nbeyond the amending power of parliament. Principles of service\n\njurisprudence are different from constitutional limitations. They are\n\nnot axioms like, secularism, federalism, etc. Nor can these concepts\n\nbe elevated to the status of an axiom like secularism, constitutional\n\nsovereignty, etc. it cannot be said that by insertion of the concept\n\nof 'consequential seniority' the structure of\nArticle 16(1)\nstands\n\ndestroyed or abrogated. Obliteration of these concepts or insertion\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 31\n\nof these concepts do not change the equality code indicated by\n\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\nof the Constitution. hence, the same cannot\n\nbind the amending power of Parliament and is not beyond the\n\namending power of Parliament. However, whether weightage of\n\nearlier accelerated promotion with consequential seniority should\n\nbe given or not are matters which would fall within the discretion of\n\nthe appropriate Government, keeping in mind the backwardness,\n\ninadequacy and representation in public employment and overall\n\nefficiency of services.\n\n37. The matter has been again considered by their\n\nLordships' of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of\nSuraj Bhan\n\nMeena v. State of Rajasthan,\nRajasthan\n, (2011) 1 SCC 467,\n467 wherein the\n\naforesaid principles have been reiterated.\n\nPlacing the whole\n\nhistory, Hon'ble the Supreme Court has held that the principles\nlaid\n\ndown in\n\nM. Nagaraj\n's case (supra) are binding. It has been found\n\nthat the concepts of 'catch-up' rule and 'consequential seniority'\n\nare judicially evolved concepts and were not to be elevated to the\n\nstatus of a constitutional principle so as to place them beyond the\n\namending power of the Parliament, however, the requirement of\n\nArticles 16(4A)\nand\n16(4B)\nwould have to be maintained and the\n\ntests indicated therein would have to be satisfied, which could only\n\nbe achieved after an inquiry as to identity. In cases where no\n\nexercise was undertaken in terms of\nArticle 16(4A)\nto acquire\n\nquantifiable data regarding the inadequacy of representation of\n\nSC/ST communities in public services, the Courts have rightly\n\nquashed the notifications.\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 32\n\n38. When the principles\nlaid down in\nthe case of\nM. Nagaraj\n\n(supra) and\nSuraj Bhan Meena\n(supra) are applied to the\n\nnotifications impugned in the present proceedings, namely,\n\n11.7.2002, 31.1.2005 (R-1 and R-2) and further notification dated\n\n21.1.2009 and 10.8.2010, it becomes clear that no survey has been\n\nundertaken to find out inadequacy of representation in respect of\n\nmembers of the SC/ST in the services. The aforesaid fact has been\n\ncandidly admitted in the written statement filed by respondent Nos.\n\n5 and 6. The aforesaid fact has also been conceded by the\n\nrespondent-Union of India in the communication dated 15.9.2010.\n\nIn para (iv) of the aforesaid communication it has been stated that\n\nno exercise was carried out to assess the inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation of SC/STs in the services under the Government of\n\nIndia before issue of instructions dated 31.1.2005. The\n\naforementioned communication has been placed on record along\n\nwith CM No. 14865 of 2010. In the absence of any survey with\n\nregard to inadequacy as also concerning the overall requirement of\n\nefficiency of the administration where reservation is to be made\n\nalongwith backwardness of the class for whom the reservation is\n\nrequired, it is not possible to sustain these notifications.\n\nAccordingly, it has to be held that these notifications suffers from\n\nviolation of the provisions of\nArticles 16(4A)\n, 16(4B)\nread with\n\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution as interpreted by the Constitution\n\nBench in\nM. Nagaraj\n's case (supra) as well as in Suraj Bhan Meena's\n\ncase (supra).\n\n(supra)\n\n39. The net result is that no reservation in promotion could\n\nbe made in pursuance to office memorandum dated 2.7.1997. We\n\nCWP No. 13218 of 2009 (O&M) 33\n\nare not dealing with many other contentions raised by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners for the reason that the core issue going\n\nto the roots of the matter has been determined in their favour and\n\nsuch a necessity is obviated.\n\n40. As a sequel to the above discussion, the judgment of the\n\nTribunal is set aside. The instructions dated 31.1.2005 (R-2) stands\n\nwithdrawn on 10.8.2010 (P-10). Therefore, no order is required to\n\nbe passed in respect of those instructions dealing with the subject\n\nof reservation in promotion and the treatment of SC/ST candidates\n\npromoted on their own merit. Likewise, the instructions dated\n\n10.8.2010 (P-16) are hereby quashed because they are in direct\n\nconflict with the view taken by the Constitution Bench in M.\n\nNagaraj's\n\nNagaraj\n's case (\nsupra) and Suraj Bhan Meena\n's case (supra).\n\n(supra) It is\n\nfurther directed that the seniority and promotion of the Income Tax\n\nInspectors shall be made without any element of reservation in\n\npromotion.\n\n41. The writ petition stands disposed of in the above terms.\n\n(M.M. KUMAR)\nJUDGE\n\n(A.N. JINDAL)\nJINDAL)\nJuly 15\n15, 201\n2011 JUDGE\nPkapoor",
