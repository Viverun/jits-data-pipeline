Forest Service Rules, 1952 recruitment to the\nposts of Assistant conservators of Forest was made from two\nsources, namely, by direct recruitment, under Rule 5(a) read\nwith Appendix 'A', and by promotion of permanent Forest\nRangers, under Rule 5(b) read with Appendix 'B'. Rule 6 of\nthe rules provided that not more than 25% of the total\nnumber of posts shall be filled by promotion.\n The petitioners (promotees) were appointed to the posts\nof Forest Rangers. Due to pendency of legal proceedings\nthere was no direct recruitment to the posts of Assistant\nConservators of Forest under Rule\n\n574\n\n5(a) till 1974 and even thereafter. The petitioners-promo-\ntees were appointed on the posts of Assistant Conservators\nof Forest on ad hoc basis, between March 13, 1974 and Novem-\nber 21, 1981 subject to direct recruitment and they were\ncontinuing temporarily on ad hoc basis for varying period of\n5 to 12 years. With effect from 1st May, 1975 the ratio of\n25% recruitment of promotees under Rule 6 was increased to\n33 1/3%. In the meanwhile the direct recruits under Rule\n5(a) were appointed on probation to substantive vacancies.\n\nWhen their claim was ripe for consideration as Deputy Con-\nservators of forest, the petitioners claiming seniority over\nthem filed Writ Petitions in this Court contending (i) that\nthough the promotees were appointed on ad hoc basis due to\nnon-availability of direct recruits yet they were continuing\nfor well over 5 to 12 years discharging the same duties,\ndrawing the same scale of pay without any reversion; their\nposts were not fortuitous, nor stop gap. Consequently their\nentire continuous length of service from the dates of their\ninitial promotion should be counted towards their seniority;\n\n(ii) since the promotees were allowed to officiate for a\nlong period they must be deemed to have been appointed in\nrelaxation of the rules of recruitment under Rule 27 of the\nrules by the Governor.\n\n On behalf of the direct recruits it was contended (i)\nsince the appointment of the promotees was on ad hoc basis\nand not on the basis of merit as per rules they have no\nright to the posts. Consequently the service rendered by\nthem from the dates of initial promotion till date of sub-\nstantive appointment being fortuitous cannot be counted\ntowards seniority; (ii) since the promotees were appointed\nin excess of the prescribed quota in Rule 6, they should be\npushed down to the vacancies that had arisen in each year\nabove the direct recruits as per the ratio as the promotees\nwere not entitled to claim seniority from the initial dates\nof their respective promotions; (iii) that the power of\nrelaxation in Rule 27 was only in respect of conditions of\nservice and not relating to recruitment or promotion.\nDisposing the petitions, this Court,\n HELD: 1. Under rule 5 read with Rule 3(h) of the U.P.\nForest Service Rules, 1952 a member of the service means a\nperson, be it direct recruit under rule 5(a) or promotee\nunder Rule 5(b), appointed in a substantive capacity to the\nservice as per the provisions of the rules. In order to\nbecome a member of the service he must satisfy two condi-\ntions, namely, the appointment must be in substantive capac-\nity and the appointment has to be to the post in the service\naccording to rules and\n\n575\n\nwithin the quota to the substantive vacancy. There exists\nmarked distinction between appointment in a substantive\ncapacity and appointment to the substantive post. Therefore,\nthe membership to the service must be preceded by an order\nof appointment to the post validly made by the Governor.\nThen only he becomes member of the service. Any other con-\nstruction would be violation of the rules.\n\n \n2. Employees appointed purely on ad hoc or officiating\nbasis due to administrative exigencies, even though contin-\nued for a long spell, do not become the members of the\nservice unless the Governor appoints them in accordance with\nthe rules and so they are not entitled to count the entire\nlength of their continuous officiating or fortuitous service\ntowards their seniority. Reckoning continuous officiating of\nad hoc promotion would enable the less privileged to excel\ntheir latent capabilities in the cadre post.\n \nNarendra Chadha v. Union of India\n, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 211;\nBaleshwardas v. State of U.P., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 449; \nN.K.\nChauhan v. State of Gujarat\n, [1977] 1 \nS.C.R. 1037 and Direct\nRecruits Class 11 Engg. Officers' Association v. State of\nMaharashtra\n, [1990] 2 S.C.C. 715; A.J. Patel & Ors. v. State\nof Gujarat & Ors., A.I.R. 1965 Guj.\n 23 (FB): referred to.\n Masoor Akhtar Khan & Ors. v. State of M.P. & Ors., J.T.\n1990 3S.C. 295; followed.\n\n A.K. Kraipak & Ors. etc. v. Union of India & Ors.,\n[1970] 1 S.C.R. 457; cited.\n\n 2.1 In the instant case due to exigencies of service\ntemporary promotions against substantive vacancies were\nmade. It is undoubted that preceding their promotion, an ad\nhoc Committee had considered the cases of the promotees.\nAdmittedly seniority subject to rejection of unfit was the\ncriteria, followed in the selection. The selection was,\ntherefore, in defiance of and dehors Rule 5(b) read with\nAppendix 'B'. The promotions were on ad hoc basis pending\ndirect recruitment and were in excess of the quota pre-\nscribed under rule 6. By no stretch of imagination it could\nbe said that the promotions were made to a substantive post\nin accordance with the rules. Therefore, the promotees do\nnot hold the post in substantive capacity. Accordingly their\ncontinuous length of ad hoc service from the date of initial\nappointment cannot be counted towards seniority.\n\n576\n\n 3. The pre-requisite of the .right to inclusion in a\ncommon list of seniority is that all those who claim that\nright must broadly bear the same characteristics. Fortuitous\ncircumstances of theft holding the grade post carrying the\nsame designation or scale of pay or discharging the same\nduty would not justify the conclusion that they being to the\nsame cadre.\n\n 4. An officer appointed by promotion in accordance with\nRules and within quota and on declaration of probation is\nentitled to reckon his seniority from the date of promotion\nand the entire length of service, though initially tempo-\nrary, shall be counted for seniority. Ad hoc or fortuitous\nappointments on a temporary or stop gap basis cannot be\ntaken into account for the purpose of seniority, even if the\nappointee was subsequently qualified to hold the post on a\nregular basis. To give benefit of such service would be\ncontrary to equality enshrined in \nArticle 14\n read with\n\nArticle 16(1)\n of the Constitution as unequals would be\ntreated as equals. When promotion is out side the quota, the\nseniority would be reckoned from the date of the vacancy\nwithin the quota, rendering the previous service fortuitous.\nThe previous promotion would be regular only from the date\nof the vacancy within the quota and seniority shall be\ncounted from that date and not from the date of his earlier\npromotion or subsequent confirmation. In order to do justice\nto the promotees it would not be proper to do injustice to\nthe direct recruits. The rule of quota being a statutory one\nmust be strictly implemented and it is impermissible for the\nauthorities concerned to deviate from the rule due to admin-\nistrative exigencies or expediency. The result of pushing\ndown the promotees appointed in excess of the quota any work\nout hardship but it is unavoidable and any construction\notherwise would be illegal, nullifying the force of statuto-\nry rules and would offend \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1).\n\n 5. Since the rules are legislative in character, they\nmust harmoniously be interpreted as a connected whole giving\nlife and force to each word, phrase and rule and no part\nthereof should be rendered nugatory or a surplusage. Resort\nto iron out the creases could be had only when the construc-\ntion of the relevant rule, phrase or word Would lead to\nunintended absurd results.\n\n 5.1 In an appropriate case if the court finds that\nwanton or deliberate deviation from the rules was made by\nthe implementing authority the court should call upon them\nto explain the reasons therefore and in the absence of\nproper explanation forthcoming castigate the authority and\npass structures condemning the actions which would\ndiscipline\n\n577\n\nthe authorities to adhere to the rules. Undue latitude and\nacquiesce thereto would not only defeat the due enforcement\nof the rules but also create disorder and frustration among\nthe members of the service.\n\n Rule 27 of the U.P. Forest Service Rules, 1952 gives\npower to the Governor that if he is satisfied that the\noperation of any rule regarding conditions of service of the\nmembers caused undue hardship in a particular case; he may\nconsult the Public Service Commission; notwithstanding\nanything contained in the Rules and dispense with or relax\nthe requirement the conditions of service and extend the\nnecessary benefit as is expedient so as to relieve hardship\nand to cause just and equitable results. The word \"may\"\nconsult the Commission has been used in the context of\ndischarge of statutory duty. The Governor is obligated to\nconsult the Public Service Commission. Therefore, the word\n\"may\" must be construed as to mean \"shall\" and it is manda-\ntory on the part of the Governor to consult the Public\nService Commission before exempting or relaxing the opera-\ntion of rule regarding conditions of the service of a member\nto relieve him from undue hardship and to cause just and\nequitable results.\n\n 5.3 There is a distinction between \"rules of recruit-\nment\" and \"conditions of service\". The rules relating to\nrecruitment to the service either under rule 5(a) or 5(b) or\nthe manner of recruitment to service as per Appendix 'A' or\n'B' are basic rules of recruitment to service. They are not\nsubject to rule 27.\n\n Narendra Chadha v. Union of India & Ors., [1986] 1\nS.C.R. 211; referred to.",
