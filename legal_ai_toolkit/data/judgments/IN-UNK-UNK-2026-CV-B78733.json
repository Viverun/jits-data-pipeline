No. 252 of 2003\n\n ===========================\n\n Dated, this the 17th day of February 2014\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n Preliminary judgment and decree in a suit\n\nfor partition passed by the learned Sub\n\nJudge,Palakkad, is challenged in this appeal.\n\nSecond defendant is the appellant.\n\n 2. Sixteen items of immovable properties\n\nwere included in the plaint, initially, for\n\npartition as belonging to the joint family of\n\nplaintiff and defendants 1 to 3 seeking\n\ndivision and allotment of 1/4th share to\n\nplaintiff. Thirunavakarasu Udayar (for short\n\nUdayar), father of plaintiff and defendants 2\n\nand 3 and husband of first defendant, Kartha of\n\nthe joint family, had passed away. After his\n\ndeath, plaintiff and defendants 2 and 3, his\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 2\n\nsons, and first defendant, his widow, are entitled\n\nto 1/4th share in the plaint properties, was the\n\ncase of plaintiff. Later, plaint was amended to\n\nstate that some items included in the plaint\n\nschedule were covered by a previous partition\n\n(Ext.A1) entered by Udayar and two of his sons\n\n(defendants 2 and 3), and, one more item of\n\nproperty was added as available for partition to\n\nsharers. Plaintiff was not a party to that deed.\n\nItems 3, 6 and 9 to 13 and 17 in the plaint are\n\nproperties allotted in Ext.A1 partition deed as\n\n'A' schedule to the father, Udayar, and after his\n\ndeath, his widow and sons, all of them, have got\n\nequal share in those items, was the case in the\n\namended plaint. Defendants 1 to 3, all of them,\n\nresisted the claim for partition over the items\n\ncovered by 'A' schedule in Ext.A1 deed allotted to\n\nUdayar contending that he had executed Ext.B3 will\n\nover those items in favour of three persons, widow\n\nof Sankaly Udayar(predeceased son of Udayar),\n\nsecond defendant's son and third defendant as A to\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 3\n\nC schedule respectively reserving life interest of\n\nhis widow, first defendant in all the above\n\nproperties.\n\n 3. Widow of Sankali Udayar and also daughter of\n\na predeceased daughter of Thirunavakarasu Udayar\n\ngot impleaded in the suit as additional 4th and 5th\n\ndefendants respectively. Son of second defendant\n\nalso got impleaded as additional sixth defendant.\n\n 4. Additional sixth defendant adopted the\n\ncontentions of his father. Additional 5th defendant\n\nclaimed share in the properties as the daughter\n\nof Parvathy, predeceased daughter of Udayar and\n\nfirst defendant. Additional fourth defendant\n\nimpeaching the validity of Ext.A1 partition deed\n\ncontended that she was entitled to 1/5th share in\n\nthe properties covered by that deed also. She was\n\nnot made a party to Ext.A1 and also not provided\n\nwith share, and therefore the partition effected\n\nwas not binding on her, was her case. She\n\ncontended that Ext.A1 was entered only for\n\nescaping from payment of levy and she did not\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 4\n\nobject to its execution since share of profits had\n\nbeen given to her. She also filed a petition with\n\na schedule including all properties divided under\n\nExt.A1 for division in the suit with other items\n\nand allotment of her share in all items.\n\n 5. Plaintiff filing a rejoinder disputed the\n\ngenuineness of Ext.B3 will contending that his\n\nfather had no capacity to execute the will and it\n\nwas created fradulently by defendants 1 to 3.\n\nChallenge against Ext.A1 partition deed was also\n\nresisted by him contending that except 'A' schedule\n\nin the deed allotted to his father the other items\n\nallotted to other sharers are not available for\n\npartition.\n\n 6. The court below framed the following issues\n\nfor adjudication.\n\n 1. Whether all the properties\n\n included in the plaint schedule are\n\n partible?\n\n 2. Whether 2nd and 3rd defendants are\n\n entitled to any right over plaint A\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 5\n\n and B schedule properties by virtue\n\n of the alleged will stated to have\n\n been executed by deceased\n\n Thirunavukarasu Udayar?\n\n 3. If the suit bad for non-joinder\n\n of necessary parties?\n\n 4. Whether plaintiff is entitled to\n\n get any share from plaint schedule\n\n property, if so, what is the\n\n quantum?\n\n 5. Reliefs and costs?\n\nThe evidence consisted of PW1 and Exts.A1 to A5\n\nfor plaintiff, and DW1 to DW3 and Exts.B1 to B3\n\nfor defendants.\n\n 7. With the impleadment of additional\n\ndefendants 4 to 6 in the suit issue raised over\n\nnonjoinder of necessary parties became reduntant.\n\nOther issues 1, 2 and 4, all of them, were\n\nconsidered together, and, learned Sub Judge\n\nentered findings thereof that Ext.A1 partition\n\ndeed executed by Udayar with his sons, plaintiff\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 6\n\nand defendants 2 and 3, was invalid since\n\nadditional fourth defendant, widow of Sankaly\n\nUdayar, (predeceased son of Udayar,) was not a\n\nparty to such deed and also not provided with her\n\nshare in the joint family properties divided.\n\nProperties described in the schedule filed by\n\nadditional fourth defendant, all items covered by\n\nExt.A1 partition deed, according to learned Sub\n\nJudge, are to be divided and allotted to the\n\nparties-members of the joint family. Ext.B3 will\n\nexecuted by Udayar by which he made bequests over\n\nthe properties covered by 'A' schedule in Ext.A1\n\npartition deed was held to be valid, but, limited\n\nto the extent of his share in the joint family\n\nproperties. On such reasoning learned Sub Judge\n\nheld that the 1/5th share of Udayar in the\n\nproperties i.e 60/300 shares would devolve upon\n\nhis legatees under Ext.B3 will (defendants 2, 3\n\nand 6), each of them getting 20/60 out of 300 in\n\nthe joint family properties. Taking into account\n\nthe death of first defendant pending suit it was\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 7\n\nheld that her shares would devolve on her legal\n\nheirs, namely, plaintiff, 2nd, 3rd and 5th\n\ndefendants. On the above conclusions formed\n\nlearned Sub Judge held that plaintiff will get\n\n67.5/300 shares, second defendant 87.5/300\n\nshares, and third defendant 87.5/300 shares and\n\nfourth defendant 30/300 shares, 5th defendant\n\n7.5/300 shares and 6th defendant 20/300 shares in\n\nthe properties described under the plaint and also\n\nitems covered by the schedule produced by\n\nadditional fourth defendant. A preliminary decree\n\nwas passed allotting shares as indicated to the\n\nrespective sharers stating that share of\n\ndefendants 3, 5 and 6 are to be allotted on\n\npayment of requisite court fee in the final decree\n\nstage. That preliminary decree is challenged in\n\nthis appeal by the second defendant.\n\n 8. The findings entered by learned Sub Judge\n\nthat Ext.A1 partition deed is not valid is\n\nassailed by appellant (second defendant)\n\ncontending that though plaintiff and additional\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 8\n\nfourth defendant are not parties to the partition\n\ndeed, both of them accepting that deed have\n\ncontinued in enjoyment of the benefits\n\nthereunder and, thus, they are incompetent to\n\nimpeach its validity. Without framing a separate\n\nissue validity of Ext.A1 was considered and\n\ndecided by the court, and, invalidating that deed\n\npartition covered by that deed was reopened,\n\naccording to appellant. Reopening of the partition\n\ncovered by Ext.A1 is assailed as unsustainable.\n\nShare division made among the parties to the suit\n\nis also impeached contending that where Ext.B3\n\nwill was found to be genuine full effect of the\n\nbequests made under that testament should have\n\nbeen given effect to, but that was not done while\n\npassing the preliminary decree.\n\n 9. I heard the counsel on both sides.\n\n \n10. At the time of hearing the thrust of\n\nchallenge put forth by senior counsel for\n\nappellant was over the finding made by learned Sub\n\nJudge on the genuineness of Ext.B3 will and giving\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 9\n\neffect to the bequests made under that will in the\n\nshare allotment of the properties, that too\n\nforming a conclusion that Ext.A1 partition deed\n\nwas not valid and partition made thereunder\n\ncannot be recognised since additional fourth\n\ndefendant was not a party and share not provided\n\nto her under that deed. When Ext.A1 partition\n\ndeed has been found invalid Ext.B3 will executed\n\nby Udayar with respect to A schedule property\n\nallotted to him under that deed could not have\n\nbeen acted upon is the submission of learned\n\ncounsel relying on \nMohd.Amin and others v. Vakil\n\nAhmed and others\n(1952 SCR 1133).\n Reliance is also\n\nplaced on an unreported decision rendered by a\n\nlearned single Judge of this court in S.A.707/1993\n\n(K.G.Jayachandra Shenoy v. K.G. Hari and others)\n\nby judgment dated 4.4.2002, whereunder the\n\ndecision of the the apex court referred to was\n\nfollowed, to buttress the challenge against the\n\ndecree on the argument canvassed. No sustainable\n\nchallenge is available to the appellant to impeach\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 10\n\nthe decree and it does not warrant any\n\ninterference is the submission of the respective\n\ncounsel appearing for respondents.\n\n 11.Perusing the records it is noticed that\n\nlearned Sub Judge has passed the preliminary\n\ndecree for partition over items of properties not\n\ncovered by plaint, nor asked for plaintiff, but\n\nincluded in a schedule filed by one of the\n\ndefendants (additional fourth defendant).\n\nPlaintiff has sought division only of the items\n\ncovered by plaint schedule viz seventeen items of\n\nproperties. Partition over item Nos 1, 2,4, 5, 7,\n\n8, 14, 15 and 16 was sought as joint family\n\nproperties and, the others, item nos 3,6 and 9 to\n\n13 and 17 as properties allotted to Udayar as 'A'\n\nschedule in Ext.A1 partition deed, which, on his\n\ndeath, according to plaintiff,devolved upon his\n\nlegal heirs, his widow and three sons. Additional\n\nfourth defendant widow of Sankaly Udayar, eldest\n\nson of Udayar, who predeceased him, contended\n\nthat Ext.A1 partition deed was invalid and all\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 11\n\nitems covered by that deed should also be\n\npartitioned among the members of the joint family.\n\nShe filed a schedule including all items in\n\nExt.A1 for partitioning them also as joint family\n\nproperties. Learned Sub Judge forming a\n\nconclusion that Ext.A1 partition deed was invalid\n\nsince additional fourth defendant was not made a\n\nparty and allotted share in the properties,has\n\npassed a decree for division of those items also,\n\nbut, at the same time, recognising the bequests\n\nmade by Udayar under Ext.B3 will to the extent of\n\nhis share in the joint family properties. Udayar\n\nwho obtained 'A' schedule properties in Ext.A1 had\n\nexecuted Ext.B3 will bequeathing those properties\n\nto some among his legal heirs reserving life\n\ninterest of his widow over them. Invalidating\n\nExt.A1, but, upholding the genuineness of Ext.B3\n\nwill, and, repelling the challenge of plaintiff\n\nthat it was fabricated, learned Sub Judge held\n\nthat properties divided under Ext.A1 are to be\n\npartitioned, and, share of Udayar in the joint\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 12\n\nfamily properties would devolve upon his legatees\n\nin Ext.B3 will. A preliminary decree was\n\nthereupon passed declaring the share allotment of\n\nparties directing division of the properties\n\nincluded in the plaint and schedule of additional\n\nfourth defendant in terms thereof in final decree\n\nproceedings.\n\n 12.The whole approach made by learned Sub\n\nJudge to the issues involved for adjudication and,\n\nparticularly, over the contention raised by\n\nadditional fourth defendant demanding inclusion of\n\nall items covered by Ext.A1 in the suit for\n\npartition instituted by another was erroneous and\n\npatently unsustainable. In a suit for partition if\n\na defendant filing a schedule ask for inclusion of\n\nsome additional items also for partition with the\n\nproperties described and included in the plaint\n\ncontending those items are also available for\n\npartition among the sharers, parties to the suit,\n\nto what extent it can be entertained has to be\n\nconsidered. If such a case is presented by one of\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 13\n\nthe defendants in the suit, can the court pass a\n\ndecree for division of those items also without\n\namending the plaint schedule including such items\n\nand without the plaintiff agreeing to and seeking\n\namendment of his plaint to include such items. At\n\nbest defendant in a suit for partition who has a\n\ngrievance that all items are not included, and as\n\nsuch the suit is bad for partial partition, can\n\nraise such a contention seeking inclusion of\n\nthose items as well for division and allotment to\n\nthe sharers. Plaintiff is the master of the suit\n\nand he is to decide what are the items to be\n\nincluded for partition. In his suit defendants\n\ncan raise a challenge that it is bad for partial\n\npartition would not enable them to seek inclusion\n\nof other items for division also unless plaintiff\n\nconcedes to do so. In a case where plea of\n\npartial partition is set up by defendant seeking\n\ninclusion of items not included, if possible,\n\ncourt can consider it as a preliminary issue and\n\nthen pass appropriate orders. Even if any such\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 14\n\norder is passed in the suit for including other\n\nitems not covered by plaint schedule, but, over\n\nwhich parties are having joint rights, only\n\nplaintiff can amend the plaint to include them. If\n\nthe plaintiff does not desire to include those\n\nitems for division no defendant without seeking\n\ntransposition as plaintiff and amendment of plaint\n\nincluding such items, and, if only that is\n\npermitted, can have division of such items of\n\nproperties.. Defendants in a suit for partition\n\nare eo-nominee plaintiffs, but, the plaintiff who\n\ninstituted the suit continues to be its\n\nmaster.Other than taking a contention that suit is\n\nbad for partial partition, if all items available\n\nfor partition are not included in the suit,\n\ndefendants are incompetent to set up any\n\ncounterclaim for inclusion of some more properties\n\nnot included in the plaint for division in the\n\nsuit instituted by another sharer.\n\n 13. Learned Sub Judge in the present case\n\naccepting the contention raised by additional\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 15\n\nfourth defendant that all properties covered by\n\nExt.A1 are also available for partition and acting\n\nupon the schedule of such properties filed by that\n\ndefendant has passed a preliminary decree\n\ndeclaring the shares of parties over such items\n\ndirecting division and allotment of such\n\nproperties to the parties. A schedule with a\n\npetition describing some more properties not\n\nincluded in plaint was filed by the additional\n\nfourth defendant after filing her written\n\nstatement. That does not form part of the\n\npleadings of parties. Though learned Sub Judge\n\nhas granted a preliminary decree over those\n\nproperties decree drafted by the court below is\n\nconfined to plaint schedule properties alone.\n\nWhen the plaint has not been amended including the\n\nitems covered by the schedule filed by additional\n\nfourth defendant and no counterclaim by defendants\n\nin a suit for partition for inclusion of other\n\nitems which are stated to have been omitted for\n\ndivision is possible, decree can be only in\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 16\n\nrespect of items described in the plaint schedule.\n\nWhere subject matter of a suit is an immovable\n\nproperty mandatory prescription is that the\n\nplaint should contain description of that\n\nproperty with all necessary particulars for its\n\nidentification. That is not an empty formality.\n\nDescription of the property given in the plaint\n\nhas to be entered in the suit register maintained\n\nby court which has to be kept as permanent\n\nrecord. A decree passed in a suit involving\n\nimmovable property, where it is the subject\n\nmatter, invariably should contain description of\n\nthat property as described in the plaint\n\nschedule. Without taking note of the above\n\nsafeguards insulated under \nthe Code of Civil\n\nProcedure\n and rules prescribed under the Civil\n\nRules of Practice, and also the incompetency of\n\ndefendant in a suit for partition to get a decree\n\nfor division of properties not included in the\n\nplaint without including them by amendment of\n\nplaint, other than contending that the suit is\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n17\n\nbad for partial partition, if that is so, the\n\ncourt below has passed a preliminary decree\n\ndirecting division of items included in the\n\nschedule filed by additional fourth defendant, all\n\nitems covered by Ext.A1, holding that such deed\n\nis void. Preliminary decree so passed is not only\n\nirregular but patently erroneous.\n\n 14. Where the decree passed is shown to be\n\nimproper and not sustainable, normally, setting it\n\naside the case has to be remitted for fresh\n\ndisposal. Still, I have looked into the question\n\nwhether in the given facts of the case and\n\nmaterials produced a remission is called for. A\n\nremission is to be ordered only if it is shown\n\nthat the suit of plaintiff is bad for partial\n\npartition in as much as the items covered by Ext.A1\n\npartition deed have not been included for\n\npartition. Such a case of partial partition can be\n\nsustained only where it is shown that the\n\ncontention raised by additional fourth defendant\n\nthat Ext.A1 is void and not binding on her is\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n18\n\nunimpeachable. I may also point out that plaintiff\n\nin his plaint has also raised some allegations that\n\nit is not binding on him since he was not made a\n\nparty when division was effected over some of the\n\nproperties of joint family by his father Udayar\n\nand two sons, second and third defendants. That\n\ncase canvassed by him has no merit is amply\n\ndemonstrated by his acceptance of the properties\n\ngiven to him under Ext.A1 partition deed\n\nincluding 'A' schedule properties in that deed,\n\nwhich was allotted to his father, that alone, for\n\ndivision among the sharers with other undivided\n\nproperties of the joint family in the suit. So\n\nthe challenge raised against the validity of Ext.A1\n\nby additional fourth defendant alone requires to be\n\nexamined. Additional fourth defendant who was not\n\nmade a party to the suit got herself impleaded\n\nmoving an application I.A.252/2003. In the\n\naffidavit sworn to in support of her application\n\nfor impleadment as a party to the suit her case was\n\nthat she being the widow of Sankaly Udayar is\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n19\n\nentitled to a share in 'A' schedule property\n\nobtained by his father Udayar under Ext.A1.\n\nWritten statement filed by her would reveal she had\n\nknowledge of the partition deed Ext.A1 on its\n\nexecution by father and two of his sons after the\n\ndeath of her husband and she did not object to the\n\ndivision since they had agreed that they would not\n\ndo any act harmful to her interest in the\n\nproperties. She was also provided with share of\n\nthe income collected from the properties was her\n\nfurther case. Ext.A1 was executed to avoid payment\n\nof levy and the property continued to be joint even\n\nafter division under the deed was her case. After\n\nimpeaching Ext.A1 in the lines indicated as above\n\nas not binding on her, when trial proceeded, it is\n\nseen, resisting the challenges against Ext.B3 will\n\nexecuted by Udayar the bequest made in her favour\n\nunder that testament was sought to be sustained.\n\nUdayar had executed Ext.B3 will in respect of\n\nproperties obtained by him as 'A' schedule under\n\nExt.A1 deed. If Ext.A1 deed goes she could not\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n20\n\nclaim the bequest under Ext.B3 will executed by\n\nUdayar over 'A' schedule obtained by him under that\n\ndeed. Additional fourth defendant has no challenge\n\nagainst the decree passed by the Sub Judge holding\n\nthat Ext.B3 will is genuine. Ext.B3 will of Udayar\n\nwould also show that additional fourth defendant\n\ncontinued to be a member of the joint family and\n\nwas taken care of by Udayar and his sons providing\n\nher shelter and meeting all her needs. She had\n\nknowledge of Ext.A1 partition deed on its\n\nexecution. She had not objected to the division\n\nof properties under that deed though not made a\n\nparty and was entitled to share as widow of\n\nSankaly Udayar. That being the case,I find\n\nchallenge raised by her questioning the validity of\n\nExt.A1 partition deed and seeking division of\n\nproperties covered by that deed also, contending\n\nthat such properties continue to remain as joint\n\nand, thus, liable to be divided among the members\n\nof joint family, is unworthy of merit.\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 21\n\n 15. Where all parties concede that there was a\n\nprevious partition under Ext.A1 deed, validity of\n\nwhich alone is disputed by additional fourth\n\ndefendant, normal presumption if that deed is\n\nfound valid is that partition is complete in all\n\nrespects as regards the person and property. That\n\npresumption is one of fact and not of law and its\n\nstrength must vary with the circumstances presented\n\nin the case. Severence of joint status may be\n\npartial or complete. The members of a joint family\n\nmauy effect division and severence only in respect\n\nof a portion of the estate retaining the status as\n\njoint family and holding the rest of the properties\n\nas that of a joint family. Since all parties\n\nconcede that even after Ext.A1 deed joint family\n\ncontinued and properties not covered by Ext.A1\n\ncontinued as joint estate whether there was any\n\ndisruption of the family after Ext.A1 does not\n\narise for consideration in the case. Partition of\n\na portion of a joint family property by itself does\n\nnot result in the disruption of a joint family and\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n22\n\nwhether there was any disruption has to be examined\n\nwith reference to the intention of parties. When\n\nthat is taken into account the properties left and\n\nundivided even after execution of Ext.A1 as there\n\nis no intention by parties to disrupt the joint\n\nfamily status continued as the joint estate of the\n\nfamily.\n\n 16. When it is shown that Ext.A1 partition\n\ndeed is unassailable, is there any merit in the\n\nchallenge canvassed by plaintiff over the\n\ngenuineness of Ext.B3 will executed by Udayar has\n\nto be examined. He alone has questioned the\n\ngenuineness of that will. Ext.B3 will has been\n\nproved by DW3 an attestor to that testament.\n\nMaterials tendered in the case clearly establish\n\nthat Udayar had testamentary capacity when Ext.B3\n\nwill was executed and it was made voluntarily and\n\non his free will. No specific challenge has been\n\nraised impeaching the genuineness of Ext.B3 will in\n\nthe appeal, but, finding made by learned Sub\n\nJudge over its genuineness after holding that\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n23\n\nExt.A1 partition deed is void that alone, is\n\nimpeached relying on the decisions referred to\n\nabove. In view of the conclusion formed that Ext.A1\n\npartition deed is valid and binding on all parties\n\nincluding additional fourth respondent challenge\n\nraised canvassing support from the above referred\n\ndecisions to impeach the finding of learned Sub\n\nJudge that Ext.B3 will is valid after holding that\n\nExt.A1 as invalid, has got only academic value.\n\nFurther more, it is also noticed, the decisions\n\nhave no application to the facts involved in the\n\ncase. \nThe Apex Court in \nMohd. Amin and others v.\n\nVakil Ahmed and others\n (1952 SCR 1133)considered\n\nvalidity of a settlement deed which was challenged\n\non a ground referable to the competency and\n\nauthority of person who represented as guardian\n\nof a minor whose interest in the property was also\n\ntransacted under the deed. On the finding formed\n\nthat the person who represented the minor, in the\n\ndeed as his guardian was incompetent and had no\n\nauthority to do so, it was held that the settlement\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n24\n\nwas void not only against the minor but against all\n\nthe parties including those who are so juris.\n The\n\nabove decision was followed in the unreported\n\ndecision in Jayachandra Shenoy's case in which also\n\nchallenge was over the validity of a settlement\n\ndeed where one among the parties having interest\n\nover the property was not a party to the deed. The\n\ntwo decisions referred to have no application in\n\nexamining the testamentary succession made by a\n\nHindu in disposing his property by will.\n\nExplanation of Section 30 of the Act recognise\n\nright to dispose by will or other testamentary\n\ndisposition the interest of a male Hindu in a\n\nMitakshara coparcenary property. So much so, even\n\nassuming that Ext.A1 partition deed, for any\n\nreason, is found to be void, that by itself would\n\nnot invalidate the disposition made by Udayar\n\nunder Ext.B3 will. However, as already pointed out\n\nearlier, where Ext.A1 deed has been found to be\n\nvalid challenge raised to impeach Ext.B3 on the\n\nfinding entered by Sub Judge based on the above\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n25\n\ndecisions has only to be discarded as of no\n\nconsequence.\n\n 17.I have already found that the finding of\n\nlearned Sub Judge that Ext.A1 partition deed is\n\nvoid is wrong. Under Ext.A1 partition deed Udayar\n\nhad obtained 'A' schedule properties and Ext.B3\n\nwill was executed by him over such properties\n\nmaking bequests in favour of third defendant,\n\nfourth defendant and additional sixth defendant,\n\n(son of second defendant) reserving the life\n\ninterest of his wife (first defendant). When\n\nExt.B3 will is found to be genuine the legatees\n\nunder the will in terms of the bequests made in\n\ntheir favour have right over 'A' schedule property\n\nin Ext.A1. So item no.3, 6, 9 to 13 and 17\n\nincluded in the suit which are covered by 'A'\n\nschedule in Ext.A1 and Ext.B3 are not available for\n\npartition, and are to be excluded.\n\n 18. What is available for partition among the\n\nsharers, members of the joint family, is only item\n\nnos.1,2,4,5,7,8,14,15 and 16 scheduled in the\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n26\n\nplaint. Those properties alone remained as joint\n\nestate after division of the other items of joint\n\nfamily under Ext.A1 partition deed. In effecting\n\ndivision of such items among the parties shares\n\navailable to them in the properties has to be\n\nfixed. Though additional fourth defendant was not\n\nmade a party in Ext.A1 partition deed entered by\n\nUdayar and his two sons, her entitlement as a\n\nsharer being the widow of Sankaly Udayar,\n\npredeceased son of Udayar, over the items which\n\ncontinue to remain as joint cannot be disputed.\n\nSankaly Udayar who predeceased his father died in\n\n1967. \nSection 6\n of Hindu Succession Act 1956, for\n\nshort the Act, as it stood before the amendment\n\nunder Act 39 of 2005, and applicable to the\n\npresent case, spells out that on the death of a\n\nHindu having an interest in a Mitakshara\n\ncoparcenary property, after the commencement of\n\nthe Act, if he had surviving a female relative\n\nspecified in class I of the Schedule or a male\n\nrelative specified in that class who claims\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n27\n\nthrough such female relative, his interest in the\n\nMitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by\n\ntestamentary or intestate succession and not by\n\nsurvivorship. So, when Sankaly Udayar predeceased\n\nhis father leaving behind his widow, additional\n\nfourth defendant, and, his mother, first\n\ndefendant, a deemed partition over the properties\n\nof the family has to be recognised, and given\n\neffect to,for devolution of his share in the\n\nproperties which were available immediately before\n\nhis death to his heirs aforementioned. At the time\n\nof his death joint family consisted of Udayar and\n\nhis four sons as coparcenaries. On the death of\n\nSankaly Udayar a deemed partition having taken\n\nplace over the joint family properties, his widow\n\nand mother, his successors falling under Class I\n\nof the Schedule, both of them together, would take\n\n1/5th share(60/300) in the properties. First and\n\nfourth defendant as legal heirs of Sankaly Udayar\n\nwould get 30/300 shares each in the properties.\n\nOn the death of Udayar in 1976 his rights in the\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n28\n\nproperties would devolve upon his widow, three\n\nsons (plaintiff, first defendant and second\n\ndefendant)and widow of predeceased son\n\n( additional fourth defendant) and daughter of\n\npredeceased daughter(additional fifth defendant),\n\nall of whom are his heirs falling under Class I of\n\nthe Schedule. Additional sixth defendant, son of\n\nsecond defendant, not being a heir under Class I\n\nwill not be entitled to succeed to the interest\n\nleft behind by Udayar. So 1/5th share available to\n\nUdayar is to be divided equally among plaintiff\n\nand defendants 1 to 5 (60/300/6) i.e 10/300 for\n\neach of them. Pending suit first defendant, widow\n\nof Udayar, has also passed away. Her share in the\n\nproperty which she had obtained as one among the\n\ntwo heirs of Sankali Udayar, her predeceased son\n\n(30/500), and Udayar, her husband, as one among\n\nhis six heirs (10/500), both together forming\n\n40/300, would devolve upon her heirs determinable\n\nunder \nSection 15(a)\n of the Act. The heirs who\n\nare entitled to succeed her are her sons,\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n29\n\n(plaintiff and defendants 2 and 3) and daughter of\n\npredeceased daughter( additional fifth defendant),\n\nall of them getting equal share (40/300) i.e\n\n10/300 each. Share allotment of parties to the\n\nsuit in the properties which are found partible\n\nas belonging to the joint family namely, item nos\n\n1,2,4,5,7,8,14,15 and 16 would be thus:- Share of\n\nplaintiff, second and third defendant, each of\n\nthem, 80/300, fourth defendant, 40/300 and fifth\n\ndefendant 20/300.\n\n The decree passed by the court below fixing\n\nthe shares of the parties and directing division\n\nof all items in the plaint schedule and also\n\nschedule filed by the fourth defendant is set\n\naside. A preliminary decree is passed in the suit\n\ndeclaring that plaintiff, second and third\n\ndefendants, each of them, are entitled to 80/300,\n\nfourth defendant 40/300 and fifth defendant 20/300\n\nin plaint item nos 1,2,4,5,7,8,14,15 and 16.\n\nAdditional sixth defendant is not entitled to any\n\nshare. The other items in the plaint, covered by\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n30\n\n'A' schedule in Ext.A1 partition deed, item\n\nnos.3,6,9,10,11,12,13 and 17 are not available for\n\npartition and legatees under Ext.B3 will alone, in\n\naccordance with the bequests made,have right over\n\nsuch items. The legatees have to enforce their\n\nrights over those items, if need be, in\n\nappropriate proceedings, and no decree is passed\n\nor granted over those items. Direction of court\n\nbelow to defendants who have not paid court fee\n\nto remit fees in final decree proceedings to have\n\nallotment of their share, which is not proper, is\n\nmodified fixing a time limit of three months from\n\ntoday to remit the fees to claim their share in\n\nthe suit.\n\n Plaintiffs and defendants, who have paid\n\ncourt fee for getting division and allotment of\n\ntheir shares, and other defendants who are given\n\ntime for payment of court fee, on doing so, can\n\napply for passing of final decree. Equities, if\n\nany, are available to the parties can be canvassed\n\nby them, and decided, when actual division is\n\f\n\nA.S.252/2003 \n31\n\neffected in final decree proceedings. If any\n\nequity is claimed by one or other party court\n\nbelow shall consider it and pass appropriate\n\norders thereof.\n\n Appeal is disposed of as indicated above\n\ndirecting both sides to suffer their costs.\n\n S.S.SATHEESACHANDRAN\n JUDGE\n\ntpl/-\n\nA.S.252/2003 32\n\n S.S.SATHEESACHANDRAN,J.\n\n -----------------------\n\n A.S.No.252 of 2003\n\n ------------------------\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n 17TH FEBRUARY,2014\n\f\nA.S.252/2003 33",
