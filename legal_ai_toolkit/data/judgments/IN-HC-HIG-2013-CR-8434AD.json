SISTANI, J.\n\n1. Present appeal has been filed by the parents of deceased, Preeti Sharma\n(hereinafter referred to as the deceased), under\nSection 372\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, against the judgment of acquittal dated 17.8.2010,\npassed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi, in Sessions Case\nNo.70/08, whereby respondents no.2 to 4 have been acquitted for the\noffences punishable under\nSection 498A\n/\n304B\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. The case of the prosecution, as noticed by the trial court, is as under:\n\n\"1. .... DD No. 5A was registered on 17.04.2000 at PS New Ashok\nNagar regarding admission of a lady with 95% burn injuries in\nSafdarjung Hospital. PW-6 SI Rajbir Singh reached at Safdarjung\nHospital and took MLC of injured Preeti Sharma. PW-6 recorded\nher statement and informed about the occurrence to the SDM and\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 1 of 26\n\nrequested him to record statement of Preeti Sharma. SDM PW-19\nRavi Dadhich recorded statement of injured Preeti. Preeti Sharma\ndied in hospital on 19.04.00. After postmortem dead body was\nhanded over to parents of Preeti Sharma. On 21.04.00 on the\nrecommendation of SDM this FIR No. 69/00 under\nsection\n498A\n/\n304B\nwas recorded.\n\n2. After registration of FIR, further investigation was conducted by\nPW-6. From the spot, he seized various clothes in torn condition, a\ncane of kerosene oil, match box, one match stick and some pieces\nof broken bangles. PW-6 also recorded the statement of witnesses.\nThereafter further investigation of this case was marked to D.I. U.\nCell East District. Further investigation of this case was conducted\nby PW-22 Inspector A.S. Dhaka. He recorded statement of\nwitnesses. Accused Raja was arrested on 06.05.00. Accused Rajesh\nSharma and Saroj Devi Sharma, parents of accused Raja were\nformally arrested as they were granted anticipatory bail by Delhi\nHigh Court. After investigation police filed chargesheet against\nthree accused persons under\nsections498A\n/\n304B\nIPC.\n\n3. Charges under\nsections 498A\n/\n304B\n/\nIPC were given to the\naccused persons to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed\ntrial.\"\n\n3. The prosecution has examined 24 witnesses.\n\n4. Mr.Madhukar, learned counsel for the appellants, submits that the\nimpugned judgment rendered by the trial court is contrary to the evidence\nand the same is not in conformity with the law relating to matrimonial\ncruelty as contemplated under\nSection 498A\nIPC. Counsel further submits\nthat the daughter of the appellants died in unnatural circumstances within\nseven years of her marriage, she was repeatedly harassed for dowry and\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 2 of 26\n\nupon her resistance to the same she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty.\nCounsel next submits that the findings of the trial court, more particularly\nin paras 34 and 35 of the impugned judgment, are contrary to the facts.\nCounsel also submits that the deceased was subjected to cruelty on\naccount of dowry a few hours before the incident as Raja, respondent\nno.2, had demanded money from the mother of the deceased and upon her\nfailure to pay the same he had sought to leave the deceased at her\nmatrimonial home itself. Thus, the respondent no. 2 had sought to make\nthe matrimonial status of the deceased depending upon the fulfilment of\nthe said demand.\n\n5. It is contended by learned counsel for the appellants that the trial court has\nfailed to appreciate that the incident of demand of dowry soon before the\ndeath of the deceased has led to the burning of the deceased, which has\nbeen deposed by PW-4, mother of the deceased. In her statement the\nmother had categorically deposed that few hours prior to the incident of\nburning, respondent no.2 had come to her house and raised a demand of\nRs.20,000/-. Since the appellant no.2, father, was not at home she could\nnot arrange for Rs.20,000/- upon which the respondent no. 2 started\nfighting with Preeti, threatened her with dire consequences and told her\nthat he would not take her till the money was arranged by the appellants.\nIt is further contended that appellant no.2 had pleaded her daughter to stay\nback but she insisted on going back with respondent no.2.\n\n6. Another argument has been raised by learned counsel for the appellants\nthat the trial court has failed to appreciate that at the time of the incident\nthe deceased was present behind closed doors along with the husband,\nrespondent no.2, and no reasonable explanation is forthcoming from\nrespondent no.2 so as to explain the cause of death of the deceased.\n\n7. It is next contended by learned counsel for the appellants that respondent\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 3 of 26\n\nno.2, husband, did not suffer any burn injuries to douse the flames which\nwould have resulted in injuries to his hands. It is further contended that\nthere are material contradictions as two versions have been given out by\nrespondent no.2 to the prosecution witnesses i.e. PW-2 and PW-7\nimmediately after the incident. It is further contended that PW-7, Rahul\nJain, who accompanied appellant no.2 to the hospital in NOIDA, was\ninformed by respondent no.2 that cause of injuries sustained was during\ncooking whereas PW-2, Vir Singh, was informed that the cause of injuries\nwere self-inflicted. It is also contended that respondent no.2 acted in a\nsuspicious manner with regard to the cause of burns sustained by the\ndeceased.\n\n8. Another leg of the argument of learned counsel for the appellants is that\nthe trial court committed an error in relying upon the dying declaration\nrecorded by the SDM. It is further submitted that the deceased suffered\n95% burns and, thus, in the ordinary nature of things she would be\nincapable or would not be in a position to speak. It is also submitted that\nthe dying declaration bears the thumb impression of the deceased, who\nwas completely burnt.\n\n9. Learned counsel for the appellants also submits that the dying declaration\ncannot be relied upon as it is not credible for the reason that in the dying\ndeclaration the time of the incident has been mentioned as 11.30 p.m.\nwhereas the deceased and respondent no.2 had entered their society\ncomplex at 2.00 a.m. (in the night). Further as per the dying declaration\nthe period of marriage between the deceased and respondent no.2 was\nfour months whereas in fact they were married for six months. It is, thus,\nsubmitted that the dying declaration does not inspire confidence. Counsel\nfurther submits that given the 95% burn injuries, the deceased could not\nhave made any statement to the SDM. Counsel submits that the purported\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 4 of 26\n\nfitness certificate has overwriting and that too in a different ink, which\nestablishes the collusion between the authorities and respondents no.2 to\n\n4. It is also submitted that Dr. Savita, who signed the fitness certificate,\nwas not examined by the prosecution and PW-13, Dr. Savita, proved her\nsignatures on the fitness certificate. It is next submitted that the dying\ndeclaration was not signed by any witness or the Doctor, who signed the\nfitness certificate.\n\n10. To buttress his argument that the dying declaration is unreliable since the\ndeceased had mentioned the date of incident as 11.30 p.m., reliance is\nplaced on the evidence of PW-12, the chawkidar, to show that the\ndeceased and respondent no.2 had entered the main gate of the flat at 2.00\na.m. (in the night). The evidence of PW-12 reads as under:\n\n\"PW-12 Surinder Nath s/o.Sh.Siddhi Nath aged 41 years,\nChokidar, R/o.Jhuggi No.114 Sector 10, Noida U.P. permanent\naddress Village Fulad, PS Paru, Distt. Muzaffarpur Bhiar.\n\nOn SA.\n\nI am working as guard in AIIMS apartment Vasundhara\nEnclave Delhi. I know accused Shantanu Raja present in the court,\nwitness correctly identified as in year 2000 he was residing in flat\nno.28 alongwith his wife. In the night of 16/17 April, 2000 I was\non night duty from 8 pm. to 8 am. In that night accused Shantanu\nalong with his wife and entered in the main gate of flats at about 2\nam (right) in his car. At about 4 am accused went outside the gate\nin his car. I did not check the vehicle of accused as I knew accused\nShantanu being the resident of society and sticker of the society\nwas affixed on the vehicle. I did not make any entry of the vehicle\nof accused in the register being the resident of the society. I have\nbrought the original register maintained at the gate for coming and\noutgoing the vehicle inside the society. The photostate copy of\nregister dated 17-04-00 is Ex.PW-12/A (within 3 pages) original\nregister seen and returned. One copy given to Ld. APP, one copy\ngiven to accused persons and one copy retained in judicial file. On\nthe next day i.e. 18-4-00 police recorded my statement.\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 5 of 26\n\nxxxxxxxx by Sh.S.K. Ahluwalia counsel for all accused\n\nIn those days the parents of Shantanu was not residing in that flat\nVol: Prior to the occurrence they used to reside. I cannot tell when\nthe parents of Shantanu had left the flat before the occurrence. As\nper the entry of register on 16-4-00 one Bunty Resident of B16\nChander Nagar Ghaziabad has visited at Flat No.28 at 6:05 p.m.\nBunty is brother of Preeti. I never heard any complaint of Shantanu\nwith regard to quarrel with his wife. Generally guard used to make\nentry in the register of the visitors except the resident of the colony.\nBut sometimes visitors reluctant not to make entry in the register\nthen we generally take permission from the resident and thereafter\nallow the entry of the vehicle. I know Sh.R.K. Mittal who is\npresent in the court today. As per the register entry Mr.R.K. Mittal\nR/o.B-16, Chander Nagar Ghaziabad had visited in flat no.28 at\nabout 9:45 pm and went from gate at 11 pm on 9-4-00.\"\n\n11. Learned counsel for respondent no.1, State, has pointed out that no leave\nto appeal was filed against the judgment of the trial court.\n\n12. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents no.2 to 4 submits that\nthe deceased and respondent no.2 had a love marriage and they enjoyed a\nvery good relationship. Counsel further submits that the dying declaration\nof the deceased makes it abundantly clear that respondent no.2 and his\nfamily members had no role to play in the death of the deceased. Counsel\nnext submits that the dying declaration is self-explanatory as she had\nstated that on account of a quarrel with her husband, respondent no.2, on a\nsmall matter, since he told her that he would not talk to her, she put\nherself on fire by pouring kerosene oil. The deceased in her statement had\ncategorically stated that there was no demand for dowry and it was a love\nmarriage of the deceased and respondent no.2 as they were having an\naffair for the last three years. The deceased also made it clear that her in-\nlaws resided at Bijnor and there was nothing against them.\n\n13. Learned counsel for respondents no.2 to 4 contends that the parents of the\ndeceased and her relations have made false depositions on account of the\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 6 of 26\n\nfact that they never approved the love marriage between the deceased and\nrespondent no.2 and this forced the deceased and respondent no.2 to get\nmarried after running away from their house. Counsel next contends that\nthere is no question of demanding any dowry by respondent no.2 or his\nfamily, as respondent no.2 is a well-settled person and carries on the\nbusiness of property dealing.\n\n14. Learned counsel for respondents no.2 to 4 has placed reliance on the\nevidence of DW-1 to DW-3 to show that the parents of respondent no.2\nwere residing at Bijnor. As per the evidence of DW-1, DW-2 and DW-3\nthe deceased was an acquaintance of respondent no.2 and she had visited\ntheir house once or twice; the deceased had informed them of her love;\nand her parents were interfering in her matrimonial home.\n\n15. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and given our thoughtful\nconsideration to the matter. We have also perused the trial court record,\nwhich was summoned. The arguments of learned counsel for the\nappellants can be summarised as under:\n\n The evidence of the parents of the deceased and close relations\nclearly proves that the deceased was being harassed for demand of\ndowry, she was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband\nand her in-laws in connection with demand of dowry soon before\nher death and since the death of the deceased was in unnatural\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage a presumption\nunder\nSection 113B\nof the Indian Evidence Act is against\nrespondents no. 2 to 4 and accordingly Section 304B would be\nattracted.\n\n The dying declaration is neither credible nor trustworthy as Preeti\nhad suffered 95% injuries and she was not in a position to make a\nstatement, which is also evident from the fact that she had made\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 7 of 26\n\ntwo factual errors in her statement which she would not have made\nin case she was in her right senses.\n\n Doctor has not signed the dying declaration as a witness.\n\n16. Arguments of learned counsel for the respondents can be summarised as\nunder:\n\n The dying declaration was made before the SDM.\n There was no necessity that the Doctor should have signed the\ndying declaration as a witness.\n\n In case there was any tutoring then respondent no.2 would have\nensured that there would be no factual error.\n\n Respondent no.2 made every effort to save the deceased, in the\nmiddle of the night he even took help of two of his friends and in\ncase there was anything to hide he would not have done so. Thus\nthe dying declaration is truthful and reliable and consequently the\nsame has been rightly relied upon by the prosecution itself.\n The deceased and respondent no.2 had got married after running\naway from their house against the wishes of the parents of the\ndeceased and in view thereof there was no dowry and for the same\nreason being unhappy over the relationship the parents and relations\nof the deceased have deposed falsely to implicate respondents no.2\nto 4.\n\n Evidence of PW-1, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-20 is unreliable and is\nexaggerated.\n\n17. Before considering the rival contentions raised by the counsel for the\nparties it would be useful to recall the principles as laid down by the\nSupreme Court of India to be followed while considering an appeal\nagainst acquittal. While considering an appeal against acquittal, the High\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 8 of 26\n\nCourt has full power to review and consider the entire evidence but only\nafter considering each ground on which the order of acquittal was passed\nand also giving reasons for not accepting the view expressed by the trial\ncourt. The underlying principle is that while reversing the finding of\nacquittal the High Court must take into account that the presumption of\ninnocence is still available in favour of the accused and in fact would\nstand strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court.\nWhile deciding a leave to appeal filed by the State, in case two views are\npossible, the High Court must not grant leave if the trial court has taken\none of the plausible views, in contrast thereto in an appeal filed against\nacquittal. Upon re-appraisal of evidence and relevant material placed on\nrecord, in case the High Court reaches a conclusion that another view can\nreasonably be taken, then the view which favours the accused should be\nadopted. Unless the High Court arrives at a definite conclusion that the\nfinding recorded by the trial court are perverse, the High Court would not\nsubstitute its own views on a totally different perspective.\nIn the case of\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh Vs. Dal Singh & Ors.\nreported at JT 2013 (8)\nSC 625 the Supreme Court has held that the appellate court while\nconsidering the appeal against the judgment of acquittal shall interfere\nonly when there are compelling and substantial reasons for doing so and if\nthe judgment is unreasonable and relevant material have been\nunjustifiably ignored, it would be a compelling reason for interference.\n\nIn\nthe case of\nRukia Begum Vs. State of Karnataka\nAIR 2011 SC 1585 the\nApex Court has held that in case two views are possible and the trial court\nhas taken the view favouring acquittal, the High Court should not disturb\nthe finding. In paragraph 8 of the judgment, it was held that:\n\n\"8. We have bestowed our consideration to the rival submissions\nand we are of the opinion that the circumstantial evidence brought\nagainst these appellants are not such which lead towards their guilt.\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 9 of 26\n\nAs stated earlier, recovery from these appellants itself has been\ndiscarded by the High Court. In our opinion motive alone, in the\nabsence of any other circumstantial evidence would not be\nsufficient to sustain the conviction of these two appellants. It is\nworthwhile mentioning here that the trial court on appraisal of the\nevidence came to the conclusion that the prosecution has not been\nable to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt, so far as Rukia\nBegum and Nasreen are concerned. It is trite that where two views\non the evidence are reasonably possible and the trial court has taken\na view favouring acquittal, the High Court in an appeal against\nacquittal should not disturb the same merely on the ground that if it\nwas trying the case, it would have taken an alternative view and\nconvicted the accused. The High court while hearing appeal against\nthe judgment of acquittal is possessed of all the power of appellate\ncourt and nothing prevents it to appraise evidence and come to a\nconclusion different than that of the trial court but while doing so it\nshall bear in mind that presumption of innocence is further\nreinforced by acquittal of the accused by the trial court. The view of\nthe trial Judge as to the credibility of the witness must be given\nproper weight and consideration. There must be compelling and\nweighty reason for the High Court to come to a conclusion different\nthan that of the trial court. The view taken by the trial court was\njustified in the facts and circumstances of the case and a possible\nview and, therefore in our opinion, the High Court erred in setting\naside their acquittal.\"\n\n18. The present appeal filed by the parents of the deceased is to be considered\non the touchstone of the law which has been\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme\nCourt. The main thrust of the argument of counsel for the appellants is\nthat the dying declaration, sought to be relied upon by the trial court in\narriving at the decision of acquittal of respondents no.2 to 4, is perverse as\nthe dying declaration is unreliable, the same has not been witnessed by the\ndoctor, it contains factual errors and moreover Preeti was incapable of\nmaking a statement as she had sustained 95% burns. This submission of\ncounsel for the appellants is without any force. Ex.PW-19/A is the\nstatement of the deceased recorded by PW-19, which reads as under:\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 10 of 26\n\n\"Q. What is your name?\n\nA. Preeti Sharma.\nQ. What is your husband‟s name?\nA. Raja.\nQ. Where do you live?\nA. Vasundara Enclave\nQ. What is your age?\nA. 21 years.\nQ. How old is your marriage?\nA. Four months.\nQ. How do you receive burn injuries?\nA. I had a quarrel with my husband on some small matter\n\nyesterday morning. He told me that he will not talk to me.\nThereafter I put myself on fire in drawing room putting\nkerosene oil at 11:30 P.M.\nQ. Any demand of dowry?\n\nA. No. It is a love marriage. We were having affair for the last\nthree years.\n\nQ. Where do your inlaws reside?\nA. Bijnaur. There was nothing against them.\"\n\n19.\nIn a recent decision reported in\nRafique @ Rauf & Others v. State of\nU.P.\n, reported at 2013 (7) SCALE 708, the Supreme Court considered in\ndetail the provisions concerning the extent of reliance that can be placed\nupon the dying declaration. Paras 13 to 20 read as under:\n\n\"13. In this context when we make reference to the statutory\nprovisions concerning the extent of reliance that can be placed upon\nthe dying declaration and also the implication of Section 162(2)\nCr.P.C. vis-à-vis Section 32(1) of the Evidence Act, 1872, we feel\nthat it will be appropriate to make a reference to the decision of this\nCourt reported in Khushal Rao vs. State of Bombay - AIR 1958 SC\n\n22. Justice Sinha speaking for the Bench after making further\nreference to a Full Bench decision of the High Court of Madras\nheaded by Sir Lionel Leach, C.J., a decision of the Judicial\nCommittee of the Privy Council and „Phipson on Evidence‟ - 9th\nEd., formulated certain principles to be applied to place any\nreliance upon such statements. We feel that the substance of the\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 11 of 26\n\nprinciples stated in the Full Bench decision and the Judicial\nCommittee of the Privy Council and the author Phipson‟s view\npoint on accepting a statement as dying declaration can also be\nnoted in order to understand the principles ultimately\nlaid down by\n\nthis Court in paragraph 16.\n\n14. The Full Bench of the Madras High Court reported in In re,\nGuruswami Tevar - ILR 1940 Mad 158 at page 170 (AIR 1940\nMad 196 at p.200) in its unanimous opinion stated that no hard and\nfast rule can be laid down as to when a dying declaration should be\naccepted, except stating that each case must be decided in the light\nof its own facts and other circumstances. What all the Court has to\nultimately conclude is whether the Court is convinced of the\ntruthfulness of the statement, notwithstanding that there was no\ncorroboration in the true sense. The thrust was to the position that\nthe Court must be fully convinced of the truth of the statement and\nthat it should not give any scope for suspicion as to its credibility.\nThis Court noted that the High Court of Patna and Nagpur also\nexpressed the same view in the decisions reported in\nMohamad Arif\nvs. Emperor\n- AIR 1941 Pat.409 (J) and Gulabrao Krishnajee vs.\nEmperor - AIR 1945 Nag. 153 (K).\n\n15. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council while dealing with\na case, which went from Ceylon, which was based on an analogous\nprovision to\nSection 32(1)\nof the Indian Evidence Act, took the\nview that apart from the evidence of the deceased the other\nevidence was not sufficient to warrant a conviction. It was,\nhowever, held that in that case when the statement of the deceased\nwas received and believed as it evidently was by the jury it was\nclear and unmistakable in its effect and thereby, the conviction was\nfully justified and was inevitable. The Judicial Committee noted\nthat the factum of a murderous attack, though resulted in the cutting\nof the throat and the victim was not in a position to speak but yet by\nmere signs she was able to convey what she intended to speak out,\nand the said evidence was brought within the four corners of the\nconcept of dying declaration, which formed the sole basis\nultimately for the Court to convict the accused, which was also\nconfirmed by the Supreme Court of Ceylon, as well as by the\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\n16. The author Phipson in his 9th Ed., of the book on Evidence\nmade the following observations:\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 12 of 26\n\n\"......The deceased then signed a statement implicating the\nprisoner, but which was not elicited by question and answer,\nand died on March 20. It was objected that being begun in\nthat form, it was inadmissible:- Held (1) the questions and\nanswers as to his state of mind were no part of the dying\ndeclaration; (2) that even if they were, they only affected its\nweight, not its admissibility; and (3) that the declaration was\nsufficient, without other evidence, for conviction R. v.\nFitzpatrick, (1910) 46 Ir. L.T. 173 (M).\"\n\n17. After considering the above legal principles, this Court has set\ndown the following six tests to be applied for relying upon a\nmaterial statement as a dying declaration:\n\n\"16. On a review of the relevant provisions of the\nEvidence\nAct\nand of the decided cases in the different High Courts in\nIndia and in this Court, we have come to the conclusion, in\nagreement with the opinion of the Full Bench of the Madras\nHigh Court, aforesaid, (1) that it cannot be laid down as an\nabsolute rule of law that a dying declaration cannot form the\nsole basis of conviction unless it is corroborated; (2) that\neach case must be determined on its own facts keeping in\nview the circumstances in which the dying declaration was\nmade; (3) that it cannot be laid down as a general proposition\nthat a dying declaration is a weaker kind of evidence than\nother pieces of evidence; (4) that a dying declaration stands\non the same footing as another piece of evidence and has to\nbe judged in the light of surrounding circumstances and with\nreference to the principles governing the weighing of\nevidence; (5) that a dying declaration which has been\nrecorded by a competent magistrate in the proper manner,\nthat is to say, in the form of questions and answers, and, as\nfar as practicable, in the words of the maker of the\ndeclaration, stands on a much higher footing than a dying\ndeclaration which depends upon oral testimony which may\nsuffer from all the infirmities of human memory and human\ncharacter, and (6) that in order to test the reliability of a\ndying declaration, the Court has to keep in view the\ncircumstances like the opportunity of the dying man for\nobservation, for example, whether there was sufficient light\nif the crime was committed at night; whether the capacity of\nthe man to remember the facts stated had not been impaired\nat the time he was making the statement, by circumstances\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 13 of 26\n\nbeyond his control; that the statement has been consistent\nthroughout if he had several opportunities of making a dying\ndeclaration apart from the official record of it; and that the\nstatement had been made at the earliest opportunity and was\nnot the result of tutoring by interested parties.\" (Emphasis\nadded)\n\n18. We also wish to add that as on date, there is no statutory\nprescription as to in what manner or the procedure to be followed\nfor recording a dying declaration to fall within the four corners of\n\nSection 32(1)\nof the Evidence Act. The presence of Magistrate;\ncertification of the doctor as to the mental or the physical status of\nthe person making the declaration, were all developed by judicial\npronouncements. As has been repeatedly stated in various\ndecisions, it will have to be found out whether in the facts and\ncircumstances of any case the reliance placed upon by the\nprosecution on a statement alleged to have been made by the\ndeceased prior to his death can be accepted as a dying declaration,\nwill depend upon the facts and circumstances that existed at the\ntime of making the statement. In that case it would mainly depend\nupon the date and time vis-à-vis the occurrence when the statement\nwas alleged to have been made, the place at which it was made, the\nperson to whom the said statement was made, the sequence of\nevents, which led the person concerned to make the statement, the\nphysical and mental condition of the person who made the\nstatement, the cogency with which any such statement was made,\nthe attending circumstances, whether throw any suspicion as to the\nfactum of the statement said to have been made or any other factor\nexisting in order to contradict the statement said to have been made\nas claimed by the prosecution, the nexus of the person who made\nthe statement to the alleged crime and the parties involved in the\ncrime, the circumstance which made the person to come forward\nwith the statement and last but not the least, whether the said\nstatement fully support the case of the prosecution.\n\n19.\nIn this context, we can also make a reference to a decision of\nthis Court reported in\nCherlopalli Cheliminabi Saheb and another\nvs. State of Andhra Pradesh\n- (2003) 2 SCC 571, where it was held\nthat it was not absolutely mandatory that in every case a dying\ndeclaration should be recorded only by a Magistrate.\n\nThe said\nposition was reiterated in\nDhan Singh vs. State of Haryana\n- (2010)\n12 SCC 277 wherein, it was held that neither\nSection 32\nof the\nEvidence Act nor\nSection 162(2)\nof the Cr.P.C., mandate that the\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 14 of 26\n\ndying declaration has to be recorded by a designated or particular\nperson and that it was only by virtue of the development of law and\nthe guidelines settled by the judicial pronouncements that it is\nnormally accepted that such declaration would be recorded by a\nMagistrate or by a doctor to eliminate the chances of any doubt or\nfalse implication by the prosecution in the course of investigation.\n\n20.\nIn a recent decision of this Court reported in\nSri Bhagwan vs.\nState of U.P.\n- 2012 (11) SCALE 734, to which one of us was a\nparty, dealt with more or less an identical situation and held as\nunder in paragraphs 21 and 22:\n\n\"21. As far as the implication of 162 (2) of\nCr.P.C\n. is\nconcerned, as a proposition of law, unlike the excepted\ncircumstances under which 161 statement could be relied\nupon, as rightly contended by learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent, once the said statement though recorded under\n\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. assumes the character of dying\ndeclaration falling within the four corners of\nSection 32(1)\nof\nEvidence Act, then whatever credence that would apply to a\ndeclaration governed by\nSection 32 (1)\nshould automatically\ndeemed to apply in all force to such a statement though was\nonce recorded under\nSection 161\nCr.P.C. The above\nstatement of law would result in a position that a purported\nrecorded statement under\nSection 161\nof a victim having\nregard to the subsequent event of the death of the person\nmaking the statement who was a victim would enable the\nprosecuting authority to rely upon the said statement having\nregard to the nature and content of the said statement as one\nof dying declaration as deeming it and falling under\nSection\n32(1)\nof Evidence Act and thereby commend all the credence\nthat would be applicable to a dying declaration recorded and\nclaimed as such.\n\n22. Keeping the above principle in mind, it can be stated\nwithout any scope for contradiction that when we examine\nthe claim made on the statement recorded by PW-4 of the\ndeceased by applying\nSection 162 (2)\n, we have no hesitation\nin holding that the said statement as relied upon by the trial\nCourt as an acceptable dying declaration in all force was\nperfectly justified. We say so because no other conflicting\ncircumstance was either pointed out or demonstrated before\nthe trial Court or the High Court or before us in order to\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 15 of 26\n\nexclude the said document from being relied upon as a dying\ndeclaration of the deceased. We reiterate that having regard\nto the manner in which the said statement was recorded at the\ntime when the crime was registered originally under\nSection\nIPC within the shortest time possible within which it\ncould be recorded by PW-4 in order to provide proper\nmedical treatment to the deceased by sending him to the\nhospital, with no other intention pointed out at the instance of\nthe appellant to discredit contents of the said statement, we\nhold that the reliance placed upon the said statement as the\ndying declaration of the deceased was perfectly justified.\nHaving regard to our above conclusion, the said submission\nof the learned counsel for the appellant also stands rejected.\"\n\n20. Applying the settled position of law to the facts of this case, the\nsubmission made by learned counsel for the appellants that since the\nDoctor on duty did not witness the dying declaration, thus, the same is not\ncredible, is without any force. It is not mandatory that the Doctor on duty\nshould have been a witness in the dying declaration provided the dying\ndeclaration is held to be reliable and trustworthy.\n\n21. We may notice that PW-13, Dr.Savita Arora, has proved the MLC,\nExhibit PW-13/A, and the fitness certificate given by Dr.Savita, Exhibit\nPW-13/B. It may further be noticed that this witness was not cross-\nexamined with regard to the credibility of the fitness certificate. The\nevidence of PW-13 reads as under:\n\n\"PW-13: Dr.Savita Arora, Specialist Plastic Surgery, Safdarjung\nHospital New Delhi on sa:\n\nI have been deputed by the MS to testify on behalf of\nDr.Rajender Kumar and Dr.Swati. Who have left the services of the\nhospital.\n\nI have seen MLC No.280118 dt. 17.4.00 at 06.45 AM, the\nsame is in the handwriting of Dr.Rajender Kumar who‟s\nhandwriting and signatures I identify being conversant with the\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 16 of 26\n\nsame as he was my junior. The MLC is Ex.PW13/A which bears\nhis signature at point A. It reads as under:\n\nThat alleged history of sustaining burn injury, when she\npoured kerosene oil on her body set herself on fire after quarrel\nwith her husband. Time of burn was 2 AM on 17.4.00. Time of\nadmission was 6.45 AM on 17.04.00. She was brought by her\nhusband Raja. History was given by herself. General condition was\ncritical. She sustained 95% thermal burns. The MLC is in the\nhandwriting of Dr.Rajender and is Ex.PW13/A and his signature\ncircled at point A.\n\nI have also perused the endorsement made by Dr.Swati on\nthe application of the IO with regards to status of fitness of the\npatient.\n\nFitness for the statement was given by Dr.Swati at 1.15 PM\non 17.04.00. I am conversant with her handwriting. She had worked\nunder me. Her endorsement is Ex.PW13/B in encircled portion with\nher signature at point A.\n\nXxxxxxx by Shri S.K. Ahluwalia, Counsel for the accused persons\n\nIt is correct that the permanent address of the Doctor‟s are in the\nadministrative Branch. I have not checked the address. The MLC\nand other report were not prepared in my presence. I have no\npersonal knowledge of these MLC and other report. The history\nwas given by the patient herself.\"\n\n22. It has also been argued by learned counsel for the appellants that the\nvictim had suffered 95% burn injuries and, thus, she would not be in a fit\nstate to give the statement and there were two factual errors in the dying\ndeclaration, firstly, with regard to the time of incident and, secondly, the\nduration of marriage.\n\n23. Since Dr.Rajender Kumar, who was working as a Junior to PW-13,\nDr.Savita Arora, had left the service of the hospital, PW-13 has proved\nthe MLC, Exhibit PW-13/A, prepared by Dr.Rajender. PW-13 has also\nproved the endorsement made by Dr.Savita on the application moved by\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 17 of 26\n\nthe IO, i.e. Exhibit PW-13/B regarding the patient being fit to make a\nstatement. The statement was recorded by the SDM of the area, PW-19,\nwho has specifically stated that just before the recording of the statement\nof Preeti, he had ensured from the Doctor on duty regarding condition of\nPreeti, who was declared fit for statement on 1.15 p.m. on 17.4.2000.\nThus this submission made by counsel for the appellants is also without\nany force.\n\n24. It would be useful to refer to a recent decision of the Supreme Court\n\nSurinder Kumar Vs. State of Punjab\n, reported in 2013 (1) RCR\n(Criminal) 191, wherein the Apex Court has considered various decisions\nwhere the courts have accepted the dying declaration although the burn\ninjuries were 90% and even 100%. Relevant paragraphs of the judgment\nare reproduced below:\n\n\"Discussion and conclusion:\n\n15. The only submission before us was that the dying declaration\ngiven by Kiran Bala should not be accepted. The reasons given for\nthis were that she had 90% muscle deep burns and as per the post-\n\nmortem report the superficial skin had peeled off. It was argued that\nwith such a high degree of burns, it cannot be said that Kiran Bala\nwas in a condition to make a statement and secondly she could not\nhave signed the statement or even affixed her thumb impression. It\nwas submitted that the dying declaration is a very detailed one and\nit is not expected that a person in that condition could make such a\ndetailed dying declaration.\n\n16. We are not at all impressed by any of these submissions. There\nare a large number of decisions that have been cited before us by\nlearned counsel for the State where persons with 90% burns have\ngiven a dying declaration and that has been accepted. For example,\nin\nAmit Kumar v. State of Punjab\n, (2010) 12 SCC 285 the victim\nhad 90% burns and yet her statement was accepted. This Court\nnoted, inter alia, that the victim did not unfairly implicate anybody\nwho had not participated in the crime.\n\nThis Court relied on ten\nprinciples governing a dying declaration as mentioned in\nPaniben\nv. State of Gujarat\n, (1992) 2 SCC 474 to conclude that there was\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 18 of 26\n\nno reason to disbelieve the dying declaration given by the victim\nin\nthat case\n.\n\n17. Similarly, in\nGovindappa v. State of Karnataka\n, (2010) 6 SCC\n533 the victim had 100% burn injuries and yet she was found to be\nin a fit state of mind to give her statement and affix her left thumb\nimpression on the statement. The dying declaration was accepted\nby this Court on the evidence of the doctor that the victim was in a\nposition to talk.\n\n18.\nIn\nSukanti Moharana v. State of Orissa\n, (2009) 9 SCC 163, the\nvictim had 90 to 95 per cent burn injuries covering 90 to 95 per\ncent body surface and yet her dying declaration was accepted after\nconsidering the principles\nlaid down in\nPaniben.\n\n19.\nIn\nKamalavva v. State of Karnataka\n, (2009) 13 SCC 614,\nreference was again made to Paniben. It was noted that the doctor\nwho was present at the time of recording the dying declaration had\nattached a certificate to the effect that it was recorded in his\npresence. This Court rejected the technical objection regarding the\nnon-availability of a certificate and endorsement from the doctor\nregarding the mental fitness of the deceased. It was held that the\nview taken by this Court in numerous decisions is that this is a mere\nrule of prudence and not the ultimate test as to whether or not the\ndying declaration was truthful or voluntary.\n\n20.\nIn\nSatish Ambanna Bansode v. State of Maharashtra\n, (2009)\n11 SCC 217, the victim had 95% superficial to deep burns and after\nreferring to Paniben, her dying declaration was accepted by this\nCourt.\n\n21. Insofar as the case before us is concerned, we may only note\nthat there is no format prescribed for recording a dying declaration.\nIndeed, no such format can be prescribed. Therefore, it is not\nobligatory that a dying declaration should be recorded in a\nquestion-answer form. There may be occasions when it is possible\nto do so and others when it may not be possible to do so either\nbecause of the prevailing situation or because of the pain and agony\nthat the victim might be suffering at that point of time.\n\n22. It is also not obligatory that either an Executive Magistrate or a\nJudicial Magistrate should be present for recording a dying\ndeclaration. It is enough that there is evidence available to show\nthat the dying declaration is voluntary and truthful. There could be\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 19 of 26\n\noccasions when persons from the family of the accused are present\nand in such a situation, the victim may be under some pressure\nwhile making a dying declaration. In such a case, the Court has to\ncarefully weigh the evidence and may need to take into\nconsideration the surrounding facts to arrive at the correct factual\nposition.\"\n\n25. As far as the submission made by learned counsel for the appellants that\nthe dying declaration cannot be relied upon since it contains two factual\nerrors with regard to the time of the incident and duration of marriage is\nconcerned, the Supreme Court in the case of\nState of Madhya Pradesh v.\nDal Singh and Others\n, reported at JT 2013 (8) SC 625, where the victim\nhad suffered 100% burn injuries, dealt with a similar argument where two\ncontradictions were made in the dying declaration, firstly, as to who had\nput the kerosene oil on the victim and, secondly, who had lit the fire. The\nApex Court has held that since the patient was suffering from great mental\nand physical agony it is not expected a person to give an exact version of\nthe incident. Para 26 of the judgment reads as under:\n\n\"26. The contradictions raised by the defence in the two dying\ndeclarations, as regards who had put the kerosene oil on her, and\nwho had lit the fire have been carefully examined and explained by\nthe trial court. Furthermore, in such a state of mind, one cannot\nexpect that a person in such a physical condition, would be able to\ngive the exact version of the incident. She had been suffering from\ngreat mental and physical agony. Upon proper appreciation of the\nevidence on record, the trial court had found the dying declarations\nto be entirely believable, and worth placing reliance upon, but the\nHigh Court on a rather flimsy ground, without appreciating material\nfacts, has taken a contrary view. In our opinion, as the defence did\nnot put any question either to the executive magistrate, or to the\nI.O., or to the doctors who had examined her or conducted the post-\nmortem, with respect to whether any part of the thumb had skin on\nit or not, as in both the dying declarations, ridges and curves had\nbeen clearly found to exist, we do not see any reason to dis-believe\nthe version of events provided by the executive magistrate and the\nI.O., who had recorded the dying declarations. No suggestion was\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 20 of 26\n\nmade to either of them in this regard, nor was any explanation\nfurnished with respect to why these two independent persons who\nhad recorded the dying declarations, would have deposed against\nthe respondents accused. In the event that both of them had found\nthe deceased to be in a fit physical and mental condition to make a\nstatement, there exists no reason to disbelieve the same. In light of\nsuch a fact-situation, the concept of placing of a thumb impression,\nloses its significance altogether.\"\n\n26. Another decision rendered in the case of\nRakesh and Another v. State of\nHaryana\n, reported at 2013 (4) SCC 69 the Supreme Court has held that\neven when there was wrong description of names in the dying declaration,\nthe dying declaration still be held to be reliable.\n\n27. Accordingly, we are of the view that in case a wrong time was mentioned\nor it was stated that the deceased and respondent no.2 were married for\nfour months instead of six months, this by itself would not make the dying\ndeclaration unreliable. Moreover we find the factual errors made by Preeti\nto be rather insignificant having regard to the nature of the statement\nmade by her.\n\n28. The argument raised by learned counsel for the appellants that the dying\ndeclaration does not bear the signature of the attending Doctor as a\nwitness is not acceptable to this Court as a fitness certificate was given by\nthe concerned Doctor and, thus, in our view it is not necessary that the\nDoctor should have been a witness.\n\n29. As far as the submission of the counsel for the appellants with regard to\nthe demand of dowry soon before the death of the deceased is concerned,\nthe same has been discussed by the trial court in the following manner :\n\n\"36. In view of the proposition of law laid by Apex Court, it has to\nbe seen whether prosecution has been able to prove that deceased\nPreeti was subjected to cruelty or harassment in connection with\ndemand of dowry soon before her death. It is a case of love\nmarriage where deceased had run away from her house and has\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 21 of 26\n\nmarried with accused Raja against wishes of her family. It is was\nwithin four months of marriage, deceased set herself on fire and\nthereafter succumbed to burn injuries. As already discussed,\nregarding the alleged demand of dowry made by accused Raja and\nother two accused persons, PW1, PW4, PW5 and PW20 have made\nconsistent allegations of dowry demand against all three accused.\nStatement of PW1 is silent regarding any specific dowry demand\nmade by accused persons to the parents of the deceased. PW4 and\nPW5 have deposed that accused Rajesh and Saroj used to ask their\ndaughter to bring cash money from her parents in dowry. PW4 Raj\nKapoor has made specific allegations that in December, 1999, he\nhad given Rs.50,000/- to accused Rajesh Sharma when he had\ncome to his house along with accused Raja and his daughter. PW-4\nand PW-5 have nowhere alleged that for the alleged demand of\ndowry, if either in their presence, Preeti was harassed and tortured\nby either of the accused persons or if Preeti had ever told that she is\nbeing harassed or tortured by accused persons for demand of\ndowry. Except the alleged incident which took place on 16.04.00 in\ntheir house, which as per prosecution, was only witnessed by\ncomplainant PW-5 and neither PW4 nor PW-20 was present there\nat that time.\n\n35. As already discussed, PW-3 Smt Reeta Singh who is\nneighhourer of the parents of the deceased Preeti has deposed that\nthe mother of Preeti had told her that accused Raja and his mother\nused to torture her daughter for dowry but statement of PW-5 who\nis mother of the deceased is silent if Preeti had ever told her that her\nharassment and torture for demand of dowry either by accused Raja\nor his mother accused Saroj . Statement of PW-3 is contrary to the\nstatement of PW-4 hence is not credible and not worth reliance.\n\n37. PW-20 has deposed exaggerated version of entire story, starting\nfrom marriage of the deceased with Raja and till her death on\n18.04.00. As already discussed, PW20 has alleged that accused\nRajesh had told him that for getting money, he has hatched\nconspiracy to extract money from them. As per PW20, he had paid\nRs.250/- to each guest who appeared in the marriage. The statement\nof PW-20 roping Rakesh and Sushila, uncle and aunty of accused\nRaja in the demand of dowry is contrary to the statement of PW-4\nand PW-5. PW-20 has further deposed that on 17.04.00 when he\nreached at ICU ward Safdarjung Hospital, attendants of\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 22 of 26\n\nneighbourer patient of UP had told him that accused Raja had come\nthere with some police officials and some other persons and had\ntaken thumb impressions of Preeti on some papers and Preeti was\nsemi conscious and murmuring in low voice \" Mujhe Jala Diya,\nMujhe Jala Diya\". This statement of PW-20 is in contradiction to\nthe Statements made by PW-4 and PW-5 who were also present in\nthe hospital at that time. PW20 does not stop here. He has further\nmade allegations against first IO HC Rajbir Singh and against IO\nInspector A.S. Dhaka (PW22) and SDM Ravi Dadhich (PW19) for\nnot acting fairly and being in collusion with accused persons.\nRegarding all these allegations, there is not a single whisper in the\nstatement of PW-4 and PW-5. Because of these massive\nimprovements made by PW-20 in his statement vis a vis statement\nof PW-4 and PW-5, his testimony is not found credit worthy.\"\n\n30. We have also carefully examined the testimonies of the appellant, PW-1,\nPW-4, PW-5 & PW-20. As per the testimony of PW-4, after the marriage\nin the year 1999 respondent no.2 used to visit their house along with the\ndaughter and used to demand money in dowry. The parents of the\nrespondent no.2 also used to ask the deceased to bring cash from her\nparents. No exact date or any specific demand has been shown to have\nbeen made. It has also been deposed that in the year 1999 a sum of\nRs.50,000/- was given to the respondent no.2 besides jewellery and other\ndowry items at the time of marriage. It may be noticed that the date of\nincident in this case is 17.4.2000. According to this witness on 15.4.2000\nin his absence the respondent no.2 had come to his house at midnight and\ndemanded Rs.20,000/- and this is the incident of demand of dowry soon\nbefore the death of Preeti. The mother of the deceased has deposed on the\nsimilar lines and given the reason for demand of Rs.20,000/- as it was to\nbe re-paid to one Gurpreet Singh Dhara. PW-10, Gurpreet Singh Dhara\nhas admitted that he has given Rs.20,000/- to respondent no.2, but he had\nnever asked respondent no.2 to return the money, although respondent\nno.2 had offered to return the money, but he did not accept the same by\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 23 of 26\n\nsaying that it may be treated as a wedding gift.\n\n31.\nIn the case of\nAmar Singh v. State of Rajasthan\n, reported at 2010 (3)\nApex Court Judgments 258 (S.C.), it has been held as under:\n\n\"23. PW2 (father of the deceased) has not stated in his evidence\nbefore the Court that Jagdish and Gordhani, in any way, subjected\nthe deceased to any harassment or cruelty. PW4 (mother of the\ndeceased), however, has stated that the deceased used to complain\nabout the demand of a Scooter by Girdhari and harassment by her\nmother-in-law Gordhani, but PW-4 has not stated what was the\nexact act of Gordhani by which the deceased felt harassed. The\nevidence of PW-5 (brother of the deceased) is that whenever the\ndeceased used to come home she used to complain that her in-laws\nhave been teasing her and they were demanding a Scooter or\nRs.25,000/- for a shop and that when the deceased came home one\nmonth prior to her death, she complained that her mother-in-law\nand all other in-laws used to torture her and taunt her that she did\nnot bring anything, but PW5 has not described the exact conduct of\nthe mother-in-law and other in-laws on account of which the\ndeceased felt tortured and taunted. On the other hand, the evidence\nof PW4 is clear that Amar Singh used to taunt her that she has\ncome from a hungry house. Thus, there was evidence in the case of\nAmar Singh about his exact conduct which caused harassment to\nthe deceased but there was no such evidence in the case of Jagdish\nand Gordhani. A prosecution witness who merely uses the word\n\"harassed\" or \"tortured\" and does not describe the exact conduct of\nthe accused which, according to him, amounted to harassment or\ntorture may not be believed by the Court in cases under\nSection\n498A\nand\n304B\nIPC. For this reason, the High Court has taken a\nview that the charges against Jagdish and Gordhani have not been\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt and that their case is\ndistinguishable from that of Amar Singh and that Jagdish and\nGordhani appear to have been implicated because they were\nmembers of Amar Singh's family.\n\n24.\nIn\nKans Raj v. State of Punjab and Others\n, 2000 (2) Apex Court\nJournal 221 (S.C.) : 2000 (5) SCC 207, this Court cautioned that in\ncases where accusations of dowry deaths are made, the overt acts\nattributed to persons other than the husband are required to be\nproved beyond reasonable doubt and by mere conjectures and\nimplications such relations cannot be held guilty for the offence\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 24 of 26\n\nrelating to dowry deaths. In the aforesaid case, this Court further\nobserved that a tendency has developed for roping in all relations of\nthe in-laws of the deceased wives in the matters of dowry deaths\nwhich, if not discouraged, is likely to affect the case of the\nprosecution even against the real culprits.\n\n25. We, therefore, do not find any substance in the contention of\nDr.Singhvi that the High Court should have sustained the\nconviction of Jagdish and Gordhani and we accordingly dismiss\nthis appeal.\"\n\n32. In the present case, the mother and father of the deceased have not been\nable to establish that any specific demand of dowry was made by\nrespondents no.2 to 4 either soon after the marriage or soon before the\nincident. The alleged demand of Rs.20,000/- a day before the incident is\nnot found to be reliable and, thus, it cannot be said that there was any live\nlink between the demand of dowry and death of Preeti, more particularly,\nin view of the dying declaration of Preeti.\n\n33. The testimony of PW-20 is most unreliable, although he is the uncle of the\ndeceased, but he has given details of payments made and monies spent\nwhich have not even been stated by the mother and father of the deceased.\nIt may also be noticed that although the parents of the husband\n(respondent no.2) i.e. respondents no.3 and 4 were staying at Bijnor even\nthey were not spared in making allegations, which shows that the\ntestimonies of PW-1, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-20 are not reliable; and more\nparticularly when their own daughter has given her husband and her in-\nlaws a clean-chit.\n\n34. The submission of learned counsel for the appellants that since the victim\ndied within seven years of her marriage and that too under unnatural\ncircumstances as she was being harassed for dowry soon before her death,\nthe case would squarely be covered by\nSection 304B\nof the IPC is also\nwithout any force. There is no evidence to support this submission of\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 25 of 26\n\ncounsel for the appellants and the trial court has rightly relied upon the\ndying declaration of the deceased in which she has given a clean chit to\nrespondent no.2 and her in-laws.\n\n35. Another argument, which has been raised by learned counsel for the\nappellants, is that respondent no.2 did not take appropriate steps to save\nthe life of Preeti. We may notice that respondent no.2 was with Preeti, he\ntook her to the hospital and made all efforts to save her including calling\nup his friends in the middle of the night to seek their help. Thus, it cannot\nbe said that respondent no.2 did not make any effort to save his wife.\n\n36. For the reasons aforesaid, we find no infirmity in the view taken by the\ntrial court and in fact this is the only view which is possible. It is most\nunfortunate that young daughter of the appellants died within four months\nof her marriage with respondent no.2; but taking into consideration the\nevidence on record and the dying declaration which we find credible and\ntrustworthy, we find no reason to differ from the view taken by the trial\ncourt. The appeal is without any merit and the same is dismissed.\n\nG.S. SISTANI, J\n\nG.P. MITTAL, J\nSEPTEMBER 20th, 2013\nmsr/ssn\n\nCRL.A.1465/2010 Page 26 of 26",
