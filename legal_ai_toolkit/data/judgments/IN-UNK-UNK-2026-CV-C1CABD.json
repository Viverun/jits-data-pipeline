No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n order dated 15/11/2006 passed by respondent No.1 whereby respondent\n No.3 has been promoted to the post of Lecturer treating her to be senior\n to the petitioner.\n\n 3. It is the case of petitioner that she was initially appointed on the\n post of Upper Division Teacher in Pandit Motilal Nehru Higher\n Secondary School, Sagar vide order dated 23.09.1983. The Recruitment\n Rules relating to recruitment and promotion applicable to the\n Government Teachers are adopted for the recruitment and promotion of\n teachers in the schools run by the Municipal Corporation, Sagar. The\n Municipal Corporation, Sagar is the local authority constituted under the\n \nMadhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act, 1956\n. The services of the\n petitioners are government by Madhya Pradesh Non-Gazetted Class-III\n Education Service (Non-Collegiate Branch) Recruitment and Promotion\n Rules, 1973. In terms of the Rules, the post of Upper Division Teacher\n is a class-III post and as per Schedule-III, Column-5, the required\n qualification for the post of Upper Division Teacher was earlier second\n division in Bachelor Degree which was subsequently amended on\n 16.06.1993 and the required qualification as per amendment is second\n class in Bachelor Degree and B.Ed. For the post of Upper Division\n Teacher. It is the case of the petitioner that he was appointed prior to the\n amendment, therefore, she will be governed by the earlier rules.\n Promotion to the post of Lecturer which is notified as Class-II post is\n regulated by the Recruitment rules known as Madhya Pradesh Education\n Service (School Branch) Recruitment & Promotion Rules, 1982. In\n terms of Schedule-I, the Lecturer, Higher Secondary Schools are\n classified as Class-II post. In terms of Schedule-IV, the Upper Division\n Teacher on completion of five years of service will be promoted to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 3 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n post of Lecturer, Higher Secondary School. The basis of promotion\n from Class-III to Class-II post shall be seniority-cum-suitability. Thus, it\n is clear that for the post of Upper Division Teacher, the essential\n qualification was second class Bachelor Degree prior to 16.06.1993 and\n after amendment, necessary qualification was second class in Bachelor\n Degree and B.Ed. Petitioner's initial appointment was made as daily\n wage employee on the post of Upper Division Teacher by order dated\n 23.09.1983 and was continued on the said post until she was granted\n regular pay-scale on the post of Upper Division Teacher vide order\n dated 24.03.1984. Vide order dated 08.06.1987, petitioner's appointment\n was approved by the Public Service Commission.\n\n 4. It is argued that as the petitioner's appointment was approved by\n the Public Service Commission and as the appointment of the\n respondent No.3 was not approved by the Public Service Commission,\n therefore, respondent No.3 was not eligible to be appointed on the post\n of Upper Division Teacher in the Corporation. Being aggrieved,\n respondent No.3 preferred a petition being M.P. No.519/1986 which\n was dismissed observing that she is third division in Higher Secondary\n as well as third Division in Graduation, therefore, she was rightly not\n appointed to the post of Upper Division Teacher. Therefore, she was not\n eligible to hold the post of Upper Division Teacher. Her services ought\n to have been counted from the date when the Public Service\n Commission has affirmed her services on the post of Upper Division\n Teacher.\n\n 5. It is argued that respondent No.3 has passed the Bachelor degree\n in third division, therefore, she was not entitled to be given appointment\n on the post of Upper Division Teacher coupled with the fact that\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 4 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n appointment of respondent No.3 is not approved by Public Service\n Commission. The appointment of respondent No.3 was as a daily rated\n on the post of Upper Division Teacher on 14/09/1983 for a period of 2\n months. Thereafter, vide order dated 03/10/1985, she was given\n appointment on the post of Upper Division Teacher on adhoc basis for a\n period of six months in pay scale of Rs.740-1180/-. Therefore, it was\n clear that she was not having eligibility to hold the post of Upper\n Division Teacher. Gross irregularities have been committed by the\n Authorities in posting the respondent No.3 as Upper Division Teacher.\n Petitioner has been superseded, therefore, she has filed this petition.\n\n 6. It is further pointed out that respondent No.3 has filed Writ\n Petition No.1199/1995 claiming salary of the post of Lecturer with\n effect from 01/07/1992. The Division Bench of this Court vide order\n dated 12/11/1986 has directed the respondents to make payment of\n officiating allowance or salary as she was working on the post of\n Lecturer from 01/07/1992 and it was further directed that if the\n petitioner is eligible and qualified to be considered for promotion to the\n said post subject to vacancy with respondents for the post of Lecturer,\n she be considered for promotion by holding D.P.C. In pursuant to the\n said order, the Authorities misinterpreted the direction given by the\n Court and wrongly extended the benefit of promotion on the post of\n Lecturer to respondent No.3 de hors the Rules.\n\n 7. The minutes of DPC dated 10/05/2006 are placed before the Court\n pointing out the fact that against first vacancy of the post of Lecturer\n (Political Science), name of respondent No.3 was recommended\n whereas, against second vacancy, Mr. B.L. Khare is performing his\n duties. Name of petitioner was kept in waiting list at S.No.1. Petitioner\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 5 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n has already been extended the benefit of Kramonnati scale on\n completion of 12 years in terms of Rules by order dated 12/12/1997. It\n is argued that as the petitioner is senior to respondent No.3, in all\n fairness, the case of petitioner should have been considered by the\n Authorities. Even Mr. B.L. Khare, who was working as Lecturer\n (Economics) who was also directed to work as Lecturer (Political\n Science) against the vacant post, has retired on attaining the age of\n superannuation on 30/10/2006. Therefore post of Lecturer has fallen\n vacant. The Authorities should have picked up the petitioner from\n waiting list and should have extended the benefit. Therefore, this\n petition has been filed seeking quashment of promotion of respondent\n No.3.\n\n 8. On being noticed, a reply has been filed by respondent No.1\n denying all the petition averments. It is pointed out that respondent No.3\n was initially appointed on 14/09/1983 as Upper Division Teacher. Vide\n order dated 05/02/1987, she was appointed as Upper Division Teacher\n in the pay scale of Rs.575-880/-. Instead of confirming her appointment\n on the post of Upper Division Teacher, she was subsequently appointed\n as Upper Division Teacher subject to approval of Public Service\n Commission. Respondent No.3 assailed the orders by filing M.P.\n No.4863/1989 which was finally decided on 26/07/1991 and the\n Division Bench of this Court was pleaded to quash the order dated\n 04/08/1987 directing the Authorities i.e. Corporation to treat the\n respondent No.3 (petitioner therein) duly appointed on the post of\n Teacher from the date of her initial appointment and to pay her all the\n remaining benefits. The said order has attained finality as was never\n challenged before any Forum. The said order is not brought to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 6 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n knowledge of this Court by filing this petition. In view of the order\n passed by Division Bench of this Court, respondent No.3 was treated as\n UDT from the date of initial appointment. The Corporation has accepted\n the appointment of respondent No.3 on the post of UDT from the date of\n her initial appointment. Accordingly, the seniority list was prepared and\n respondent No.3 was placed above petitioner in the seniority list. The\n order dated 12/11/1986 was prior to order dated 05/02/1987, therefore,\n the Authorities have followed the order passed by Division Bench.\n Again W.P. No.119/1995 was filed by respondent No.3 which was\n decided on 22/11/2005 directing the Authorities to consider her case for\n promotion to the post of Lecturer if she is found eligible and qualified to\n be considered for promotion to the said post subject to vacancy by\n holding DPC. In pursuance of the order, DPC has been constituted on\n 10/05/2006 and respondent No.3 was found eligible on the basis of\n seniority/ suitability and her name was recommended for the post of\n Lecturer. Name of petitioner was also taken into consideration by DPC\n and after according approval from the State Government, promotion of\n respondent No.3 was ordered. Therefore, the entire procedure has been\n followed by the Authorities and in compliance of judgment passed by\n Division Bench of this Court, respondent No.3 was found suitable for\n grant of promotion in the DPC constituted on 10/05/2006. There is no\n challenge by the petitioner to the seniority list prepared by the\n Authorities in pursuance to the direction given by Division Bench of\n this Court wherein the Authorities were directed to treat respondent\n No.3 as a Teacher from her initial date of appointment, therefore prayed\n for dismissal of Writ Petition.\n\n 9. Respondent No.3 has filed her separate reply denying the petition\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 7 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n averments and virtually reiterating the contentions made by respondent\n No.1. Apart from aforesaid, it is further contended that she is having\n qualification of M.A. in Political Science (Second Division), B.Ed. and\n MMA in Philosophy (Second Division) whereas, petitioner is having\n M.A. in Police Science (Third Division) and B.Ed. Hence, respondent\n No.3 is having higher qualification than the petitioner. There is no\n dispute with respect to initial appointment of respondent No.3 on\n 05/02/1987. In stead of confirming her appointment, the Authorities\n have again appointed her as Upper Division Teacher, therefore she was\n forced to file petition before the Court and Division Bench of this Court\n has quashed the order dated 04/08/1987 directing the Corporation to\n treat the petitioner therein i.e. respondent No.3 as duly appointed to the\n post of Teacher from the date of her initial appointment and to pay her\n all monetary benefits arising therefrom. Thereafter the entire exercise\n has been taken by the Authorities in pursuant to the order passed by\n Division Bench of this Court. There is no illegality in granting\n promotion to respondent No.3 treating her senior to the petitioner.\n\n 10. Rejoinder has been filed by petitioner denying the contentions in\n the return further contending therein that even if respondent No.3 is\n given seniority with effect from the date of adhoc appointment i.e. from\n the date of her appointment as Upper Division Teacher, she will be\n junior to the petitioner. Therefore, the consideration by the Authorities\n in granting promotion to respondent No.3 is per se illegal.\n\n 11. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n\n 12. Apart from the admitted position regarding appointment of\n petitioner as well as respondent No.3, record indicates that respondent\n No.3 filed M.P. No.4863/1989 challenging the order dated 04/08/1987\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 8 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n issued by the respondents whereby she was appointed as Upper Division\n Teacher on adhoc basis. The said M.P. was finally decided by Division\n Bench of this Court on 26/07/1991 holding as under:-\n\n \"4. Learned counsel appearing for the Municipal\n Corporation made a feeble attempt to support the\n case of the Corp. stating that the petitioner did not\n possess the requisite qualification for the post.\n Having considered the submissions made by the\n counsel for the parties we are of the opinion that\n the petition deserves to succeed. We find\n substance in the contention of the petitioner that\n having possessed second division in B.Ed. she was\n qualified for the post. We are also of the opinion\n that even if there was any such qualification\n prescribed in the rules applicable to Govt. teachers,\n which were adopted by the Municipal Corporation,\n the Corporation having continued her for such a\n long period to work on the post of teacher, the\n qualifications prescribed if any, were impliedly\n relaxed in her case. The petitioner is entitled to be\n regularised on the post of Upper Division Teacher\n on the basis of her long continuance on the post.\n The respondent/ Corporation could not dispute the\n fact that even after her appointment as Upper\n Division Clerk she was discharging the duties of a\n teacher in the school.\n\n 5. Consequently, the petition is allowed. The\n impugned orders issued by the Municipal\n Corporation dated 5/2/1987 (Annexure-H) and\n dated 4/8/1987 (Annexure-K) are hereby quashed.\n It is directed that the Corporation shall treat the\n petitioner as duly appointed to the post of teacher\n with effect from her initial appointment in the\n Corporation and pay her all monetary benefits\n arising therefrom. The petitioner shall also get\n costs of this petition. Counsel fee Rs.500/-, if\n certified.\"\n\n 13. In pursuance to the order passed by Division Bench of this Court,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 9 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n an order was passed by the Commissioner on 01/08/1991 treating her\n appointment to be justified and considered her appointment from the\n initial date of appointment i.e. 14/09/1983. The said order has never\n been challenged by the respondents or by the petitioner at any point of\n time and the same has attained finality. Thereafter, Authorities have\n prepared the seniority list and finding the respondent No.3 to be the\n senior, she was placed over and above the petitioner. The DPC was\n constituted and the name of respondent No.3 finds place at S.No.1 in the\n seniority list and petitioner's name finds place at S.No.3 under the\n category of UDT. The said list has never been challenged by the\n petitioner. Thereafter, again a Writ Petition has been filed being W.P.\n No.1199/1995 by respondent No.3 against non-payment of salary of the\n post of Lecturer with effect from 01/07/1992 which was decided on\n 22/11/2005 with the following directions:-\n\n \"On careful consideration of the submissions and\n the pleadings made by the petitioner, I am of the\n view that it is a fit case which requires directions to\n be given to the respondent to consider the claim of\n the petitioner for payment of salary or officiating\n allowance to her for the post of lecturer as she is\n working in the aforesaid post with effect from 1.7.92.\n In the present case no return has been filed by the\n respondent and therefore there is no denial before\n this court about the fact that the petitioner is not\n working on the post of Lecturer with effect from\n 1.7.92. The counsel for the petitioner had not been\n able to point out any order of promotion by which the\n petitioner was appointed to the post of Lecturer but\n had demonstrated from the time table for the various\n years which are annexures P-2 and P-3 and on that\n basis it is clear that the petitioner had been working\n on the post of Lecturer.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 10 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n In view of the aforesaid, the respondents are\n directed to consider the grant of officiating allowance\n or salaries to the petitioner as she is working on the\n post of Lecturer from 1.7.92 and further to consider\n her promotion to the post of Lecturer if the petitioner\n is eligible and qualified to be considered for\n promotion to the said post subject to the vacancy\n with respondent for the post of lecturer by holding a\n DPC. The same may be done within a period of 3\n months from the date of producing certified copy of\n this order to the respondents.\n\n The petition is disposed of with no order as to\n costs.\"\n\n 14. While disposing of the Writ Petition, apart from granting benefit\n of salary/ officiating allowance of the post of Lecturer, further direction\n was issued to consider her case for promotion by holding a DPC. The\n aforesaid facts are not controverted by the petitioner. Record indicates\n that petitioner's initial appointment to the post of Upper Division\n Teacher was on 23/09/1983 and the initial appointment of respondent\n No.3 was on 14/09/1983 i.e. admittedly prior to that of petitioner. The\n respondent/Corporation has complied with the direction issued by\n Division Bench of this Court in M.P. No.4863/1989 which is admittedly\n subsequent to the order dated 12/11/1986 passed by Division Bench of\n this Court in M.P. No.519/1986. The said petition was regarding her\n appointment to the post in question, wherein observations were made\n that petitioner is 3rd Class Graduate and 3rd Division in Higher\n Secondary School Examination. Therefore, no relief was granted to her.\n The fact remains that documents which are being filed along with return\n of respondent No.3 shows that respondent No.3 is M.A. in Political\n Science (Second Division). Thus, the aforesaid averment in that order is\n factually incorrect. Apart from aforesaid, Division Bench has already\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 11 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n passed the subsequent order dated 26/07/1991 in M.P. No.4863/1989,\n quashing the order dated 04/08/1987 issued by the Authorities\n considering the petitioner as officiating UDT.\n\n 15. In absence of any challenge to the seniority list coupled with the\n fact that entire exercise was done by the Corporation in pursuant to the\n direction given by Division bench, no case for interference is made out\n in this petition. Thus, no relief can be extended to the petitioner.\n\n 16. The petition sans merit and is accordingly dismissed. No order as\n to costs.\n\n W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n 17. In W.P. No.13741/2016, petitioner has prayed for following\n relief(s):-\n\n (i) Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to direct\n the respondents to consider the case of the\n petitioner for promotion to the post of Lecturer\n Political Science in the same D.P.C. scheduled\n to be held pursuant to the decision of Mayor-in-\n\n Council dated 30.06.2016 and if she is found\n suitable, the order of promotion may kindly be\n directed to be issued giving her promotion to the\n post of Lecturer Political Science alongwith all\n consequential benefits, or alternatively, they\n may be directed not to consider the case of\n promotion of Smt. Kamlesh Choubey to the post\n of Principal in the D.P.C. till the final disposal\n of W.P. No.9715/2007(S).\n\n (ii) Any other writ, order or direction, which this\n Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts\n and circumstances of the case, may also kindly\n be passed, in the interest of justice.\n\n 18. The entire case of the petitioner is based upon challenge to the\n appointment of Smt. Kamlesh Choubey as well as her seniority.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:58767\n\n 12 W.P. No.9715/2007\n\n & W.P. No.13741/2016\n\n 19. The fact remains that this Court in connected Writ Petition\n No.9715/2007 has considered the aspect and has dismissed the Writ\n Petition filed by the petitioner holding that the entire exercise done by\n the Corporation was in view of the judgment passed by Division Bench\n of this Court. Therefore, no benefit could have been extended to the\n petitioner.\n\n 20. Once the respondent No.4 - Smt. Kamlesh Choubey is found to\n be senior to the petitioner and her name was placed over and above the\n petitioner in seniority list which has never been put to challenge, no\n ground for consideration of name of petitioner over and above\n respondent No.4 is made out. The appointment of petitioner on the post\n of Upper Division Teacher has been upheld by Division Bench of this\n Court in earlier round of litigation as well as the fact that she has been\n placed over and above the petitioner, direction to the respondents to\n consider the name of petitioner in the promotion drive could not have\n been done specifically in the circumstances when admittedly respondent\n No.4's name finds place over and above the petitioner in the seniority\n list.\n\n 21. Therefore, non-consideration of petitioner's name by DPC does\n not call for any interference in the present petition.\n\n 22. The petition sans merit and is accordingly dismissed. No order as\n to costs.\n\n (VISHAL MISHRA)\n JUDGE\n Shbhnkr\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: SHUBHANKAR\n\nMISHRA\n\nSigning time: 03-12-2024\n\n18:45:11",
