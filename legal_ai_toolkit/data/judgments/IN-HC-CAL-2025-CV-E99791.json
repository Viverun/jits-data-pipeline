Sr. Adv.\n: Mr. S.K. Singh\n: Mr. R.K. Dubey\n\nFor the respondent No. 1 : Mr. R. Guha Thakurta\n\n: Ms. S. Sengupta\n\nHeard on : 28/10/2025\n\nJudgment on : 04/12/2025\n\nRai Chattopadhyay, J. :-\n\n1. A judgment of the Hon‟ble Single Judge dated March 28, 2025 in\n\nWPA 28594 of 2022 is under challenge in the instant appeal. The\n\nsubject matter of the lis concerns with the period of continuous\n\nservice of the respondent No. 1/the workman, with the\n\nappellant/company and the amount of gratuity actually payable to\n\nhim. The judgment of the Hon‟ble Single Bench as above is that of\n\nreversal of the order of the Appellate Authority under the Payment\n\nPage 2 of 28\n\nOf Gratuity Act, 1972\nand affirming the order of the Controlling\n\nAuthority in this regard.\n\n2. The instant appeal deals with the issues inter alia that, whether the\n\nWrit Court is justified to put the appellant to a worse off position\n\neven though the order which the appellant has challenged before\n\nthe Writ Court was accepted by the beneficiary thereof (the\n\nrespondent/workman in this case), by not preferring an appeal\n\nagainst the same;\n\nWhether finding of the Writ Court of the total span of\n\n„continuous service‟ of the respondent/workman is just, legal and\n\nproper;\n\nWhether the Writ Court has duly and lawfully imposed\n\nthe adverse inference on the appellant as regards proof of\n\n„continuous service‟ of the respondent/workman in spite of the\n\nappellant having produced „some evidence‟ in the form of leave\n\nrecords and the respondent having evidently not been able to prove\n\nhis claim of continuous service with any evidence.\n\nWhether the Appellate Authority and the Hon‟ble Single\n\nBench is justified and proper to come to the finding about the last\n\ndrawn per day wages of the respondent/workman, for the purpose\n\nof calculation of the gratuity amount.\n\nPage 3 of 28\n\n3. Before coming into the judgment under challenge in this appeal, the\n\nrelevant factual background of the case is required to be narrated,\n\nwhich is as follows:-\n\n4. The respondent No. 1/workman joined the appellant company on\n\nMarch 31, 1980 as a daily rated Badli workman. His service was\n\nregularized with effect from December 10, 1995. He has been\n\nsuperannuated from the appellant company with effect from July\n\n23, 2013.\n\n5. According to the respondent No. 1/workman, immediately after his\n\nsuperannuation, he stood eligible and entitled for payment of\n\ngratuity by the appellant. However, the appellant/company has\n\nfailed to duly perform its statutory duty and obligation by\n\ndisbursing the gratuity amount in favour of the\n\nrespondent/workman. Such alleged inaction of the\n\nappellant/company prompted the respondent/workman to file his\n\napplication dated July 21, 2014 before the Controlling Authority\n\nunder the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nin statutory form \"N\". The\n\nControlling Authority by dint of his order dated October 27, 2016\n\nhas disposed of the respondent/workman‟s prayer as above with\n\nthe direction that for rendering 10 years of continuous service with\n\nthe last drawn wages to the tune of Rs. 363.92/- per day, the\n\nrespondent is entitled to an amount of gratuity of Rs. 5,45,88/-\n\nPage 4 of 28\n\nalong with admissible interests on the principal amount, for the\n\nperiod from July 24, 2013 that is the subsequent day of the date of\n\nhis superannuation, till the date of actual payment. The Controlling\n\nAuthority has further held that date of joining of the\n\nrespondent/workman that is, March 31, 1980 is undisputed. Also\n\nthat, the workman has failed to adduce adequate evidence to prove\n\nhis performance for 240 days and more, in the years of service till\n\nhe was made regular.\n\n6. The order of the Controlling Authority dated October 27, 2016\n\nthough stood acceptable for the appellant/company, however, was\n\nchallenged by the respondent/workman before the statutory\n\nAppellate Authority.\n\n7. The Appellate Authority by dint of its order dated August 25, 2022\n\nhas reversed the order of the controlling authority as above. The\n\norder of the Appellate Authority is as follows:-\n\n\"In this instant case, the appellant had failed to adduce adequate\nevidences before the Ld. Controlling Authority to proof that he\nperformed 240 days or more in the years of service from 31.03.1980\n(date of joining as claimed by the appellant which was shown in ESI\nidentity Card )\n\nOn the other hand, according to Sec 2A(1) under the\nPayment of\nGratuity Act, 1972\n, the Respondent Company has failed to adduce\nany evidence regarding issuance of an order from the Respondent\nCompany on break in service of the Appellant workman on 2000,\n2002 and 2004-2008.\n\nPage 5 of 28\n\nUnder this circumstances, the Appellate Authority is modifying the\npoint mentioned by the Ld. Controlling Authority in his order dated\n27.10.2016 regarding this instant case that the appellant workman\nhas not rendered continuous service to the Respondent Company\nfrom 10.12.1995 to 23.07.2013 i.e 18 years of continuous service.\n\nIn accordance with fortnight pay slip (Exhibit-C) the wages\n(Basic+DA) of Sri Dwarika Yadav was Rs.7142.7 for 13 days [since\nthere are 13 working days in a fortnight]. Hence, his last drawn\nwages was Rs.549.41 per day.\n\nNow the Principal Amount of Gratuity admissible to Sri Dwarika\nYadav for rendering 18 years of continuous service to Respondent\nCompany from 10.12.1995 to 23.07.2013 is Rs.549.41 x 15 x 18 = Rs.\n148340.70/-\n\nAgain Sri Dwarika Yadav, Appellant is entitled to receive interest in\nterms of\nSection 7(3A)\nof the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, at the\nrate of 10% on the Principal Amount of Rs 148340.70/- for the\nperiod from 24.07.2013 to 24.08.2022 i.e 9 years 1 month.\n\nTherefore, Interest = 148340.70 x 10/100 x 109/12 = Rs.\n134742.81/-\"\n\n8. The Appellate Authority took into consideration two aspects, firstly,\n\nthat the respondent/workman has not been able to prove his\n\ncontinuous service for 240 days or more in a year from the date of\n\nhis appointment; and also that the appellant/company has failed to\n\nadduce evidence regarding issuance of any order in accordance with\n\nSection 2A (1)\nunder the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n, concerning\n\nbreak in service of the workman in the years 2000, 2002 and 2004\n\nto 2008. The Appellate Authority has founded its decision on the\n\nreason that since the appellant/company has not issued any order\n\nfor break in service of the workman, the finding of the Controlling\n\nAuthority that he has not rendered continuous service for part of\n\nPage 6 of 28\n\nhis entire service period, was not sustainable. The Appellate\n\nAuthority has further held the last drawn wages of the\n\nrespondent/workman to be Rs. 549.41/- per day instead of the\n\namount of per day wages as was held by the Controlling Authority.\n\nThus, in effect, the order of the Controlling Authority dated October\n\n27, 2016 was reversed by the Appellate Authority by holding inter\n\nalia that the respondent/workman served in the company for 18\n\nyears continuously and he would be entitled to the amount of\n\ngratuity for rendering 18 years continuous service to the tune of Rs.\n\n1,48,340.70/- and interests to the tune of Rs. 1,34,742.81/-.\n\n9. This order of the Appellate Authority dated August 25, 2022 has\n\nbeen challenged by the appellant/company before this Court in the\n\nsaid writ petition No. WPA 28594 of 2022, which has been disposed\n\nof by the Hon‟ble Hon‟ble Single Judge, by dint of the said\n\nimpugned judgment.\n\n10. The Hon‟ble Single Judge has founded decision on the two factors\n\nthat is, firstly, no steps have been taken by the appellant/company\n\nin accordance with the statutory provisions, in spite of allegations\n\nhave been made that the workman has failed to attend duty for 240\n\ndays or more in a year, for the years 1995, 2000, 2002 to 2005 and\n\nalso that the employer/appellant has failed to maintain the master\n\nrole and duty registers as envisaged under Section 25D of the\n\nPage 7 of 28\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\n. The Court has held that adverse\n\ninference is to be drawn against the appellant/employer company\n\nso far as the period of continuous service of the workman is\n\nconcerned. The Court holds that the respondent No. 1/workman\n\nhas served the employer continuously from the date of his\n\nappointment for a period of 33 years and shall be entitled for an\n\namount of gratuity as per law for the entire period of 33 years.\n\nThus, even while upholding the order of the Appellate Authority the\n\nHon‟ble Single Judge has made modifications therein by holding the\n\nperiod of continuous service of the workman to be 33 years instead\n\nof 18 years as was found by the Appellate Authority.\n\n11. Mr. Soumya Majumder, learned senior counsel has represented the\n\nappellant/company in the instant appeal. He has submitted that\n\nthe Hon‟ble Single Judge in the impugned judgment has made out a\n\nthird case which was not espoused by any of the parties before the\n\nprevious two fora. Mr. Majumder has submitted that the Controlling\n\nAuthority held the eligible period of service for payment of gratuity\n\nto the respondent No. 1 to be 10 years which was reversed by the\n\nAppellate Authority holding his service period, for the purpose of\n\npayment of gratuity, to be 18 years. It has been pointed out that,\n\nthe Hon‟ble Single Judge without considering the findings of the\n\nstatutory authorities as above has abruptly and without any basis\n\nhas come to a finding about the eligible period of service of the\n\nPage 8 of 28\n\nrespondent No. 1/workman, to be for 33 years for the purpose of\n\npayment of gratuity. According to Mr. Majumder, when the\n\nworkman himself has submitted his length of service eligible for\n\nbeing considered for payment of gratuity to be 18 years, by not\n\nchallenging the order passed by the Appellate Authority (which was\n\nimpugned in the writ petition), no third case ought to have been\n\nmade out by the Hon‟ble Single Judge to enhance the length of\n\nservice or otherwise the said decision shall be rendered as baseless\n\nand perverse not being based on any cogent and sufficient\n\nmaterials.\n\n12. He has further submitted that the appellant could not have been\n\nput to a worse off position by preferring an appeal. He says that the\n\nappellant/employer company had never preferred any appeal but\n\naccepted the order of the Controlling Authority. On the other hand,\n\nthe Appellate Authority‟s order had not been challenged by the\n\nworkman. Therefore, the period of continuous service of the\n\nworkman, as held by the Appellate Authority, has been accepted\n\nand never challenged by him. In such circumstances the Court\n\nought not to have interfered into the finding of the Appellate\n\nAuthority as regards the period of „continuous service‟ of the\n\nrespondent/workman. In this regard, he has referred to the two\n\nfollowing Supreme Court judgments:-\n\nPage 9 of 28\n\ni) Bhagubhai Danabhai Kalasi and Anr. Vs. State of\n\nGujarat and Others\nreported at (2007) 4 SCC 241\n\nii) Ashok Kumar Nigam Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n\nand Anr. reported at (2016) 12 SCC 797\n\n13. Mr. Soumya Majumder, learned senior counsel has submitted that\n\nthe test of entitlement of continuous service is that of \"actually\n\nworked\" and it cannot be given any notional effect. He says that\n\nadmittedly, from the date of induction that is, March 31, 1980 to\n\nDecember 10, 1995, the appellant was a Badli worker in the jute\n\nmill. That, in accordance with the Certified Standing Orders, a Badli\n\nworker is classified as to have no claim of permanence or\n\nregularization in employment, but to be given job on the date when\n\npermanent workman might not have attended their duties; a job of\n\na Badli worker is not a time-bound or tenure based job; it is purely\n\ncontingent in nature. With reference to a Supreme Court judgment\n\nin\nPrakash Cotton Mills Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Rashtriya Mills Mazdoor\n\nSangh\nreported in 1986 (53) FLR 310, the appellant says that a\n\nbadly worker has no guaranteed service, but his engagement is\n\npurely contingent in nature. He submits that, since from the date of\n\nhis regularization in service on and from December 10, 1995, the\n\nrespondent/workman has not discharged duties for 240 days or\n\nmore in the years 2000, 2002 to 2005. In support thereof, the\n\nemployer company/appellant has submitted relevant leave registers\n\nPage 10 of 28\n\nbefore the fact finding authority. According to the appellant, the\n\nsame amounts to \"some evidence\" presented by the\n\nappellant/company in support of its contentions before the said\n\nAuthority.\n\nBy referring to a judgment of the Supreme Court in\nS.R.\n\nTewari Vs. Union of India and Anr.\nreported in (2013) 6 SCC\n\n602, Mr. Majumder has submitted that availability of \"some\n\nevidence\" as mentioned above, which has been produced by the\n\nemployer before the quasi-judicial Authority, should render the\n\nfinding of such Authority on the basis of the same and to be\n\nimmuned from being interfered with in exercise of power of judicial\n\nreview by this Court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nHe says that, the employer had produced \"some evidence\" before\n\nthe Controlling Authority in the form of leave records to show that\n\nthe respondent/workman had not rendered minimum 240 days of\n\nservice in each year from 1995 to 2013. Placing reliance on those\n\nrecords and believing that to be true the Controlling Authority had\n\npassed its order dated October 27, 2016. In absence of any mention\n\nof the particular nature of documents required to be maintained by\n\nthe employer in the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nfor the purpose\n\nof showing the number of days of work of the employee, the said\n\nleave records already produced by the employer could not have been\n\nignored to come to any other conclusion other than what is\n\ndeductible from the entries made in the said leave records.\n\nPage 11 of 28\n\n14. Mr. Majumder has submitted that both the Appellate Authority and\n\nthe Hon‟ble Single Judge has erred in law in drawing adverse\n\ninference against the appellant/company, in view of the fact that\n\nthe appellant has not made any order of break of service of the said\n\nworkman, in spite of alleging his absence beyond permissible\n\nperiod. He submits that, the leave records produced should be\n\nconstrued to be \"some evidence\" produced on the part of the\n\nappellant/employer company. He has further submitted that, onus\n\nof proof should lie on the person who asserts the fact. It is\n\nsubmitted that, the elementary principle of law and rule of evidence\n\nis that, one who asserts/claims, must prove his claim. Since the\n\nrespondent/workman has claimed that he has worked continuously\n\nwith the employer for all those period, the initial burden is on him\n\nto substantiate his claim with sufficient evidence. Mr. Majumder\n\nhas submitted that in the instant case, both the Appellate Authority\n\nas well as the Hon‟ble Single Judge has not been hesitant to\n\nunequivocally say that the respondent has not come up with any\n\npiece of evidence whatsoever in support of his claim of continuous\n\nservice. In such circumstances, the respondent has not discharged\n\nhis initial burden to prove his case. Mr. Majumder has submitted\n\nthat, the Appellate Authority as well as the Hon‟ble Single Bench by\n\nnot taking into consideration this aspect, has completely\n\ndisregarded the above elementary principles of law. And instead,\n\nhas granted relief to the respondent on the basis of the so-called\n\nPage 12 of 28\n\nweakness in defence, though according to him, the\n\nappellant/company having already produced some evidence in the\n\nform of leave register, even such so-called weakness in defence is\n\nalso not available as against the appellant/company.\nIn this regard,\n\nMr. Majumder has referred to the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme\n\nCourt in\nRatnagiri Nagar Parishad Vs. Gangaram Narayan\n\nAmbekar and Ors.\nreported in (2020) Vol 7 SCC 275. To buttress\n\nhis submissions that onus to prove that the employee worked for\n\n240 days in a year lies on him.\n\n15. To elaborate on this, Mr. Majumder has referred to\nSection 2A\nof the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 which provides for \"continuous\n\nservice\". He submits that the definition which underwent an\n\namendment with effect from February 11, 1981, does not come to\n\nthe aid of the respondent/workman since his case does not fall\n\nwithin the deemed continuous service in\nSection 2A(1)\nof the said\n\nAct. He says that, it is nobody‟s case here that the service of the\n\nworkman was continuous which got interrupted on account of the\n\nincidence mentioned in\nSection 2A(1)\nof the said Act. According to\n\nthe appellant therefore, the provisions of\nSection 2A(2)\nof the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 have to be considered in this case,\n\nfor reckoning the continuous service in each period of one year for\n\ncounting the period of continuous service in accordance with law.\n\nPage 13 of 28\n\n16. Mr. Soumya Majumder, learned Senior Advocate has submitted,\n\nwith reference to\nSection 13A\nof the Payment of Wages Act, 1936\n\nand Rule 83(6) of the West Bengal Factories Rule, 1948 that\n\naccording to the same and in absence of any specific provision\n\nenumerated in this regard in the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1872\n, the\n\nemployer/appellant shall only be obliged to maintain records for a\n\nperiod of three years and not more than that. In such\n\ncircumstances, he says that, reliance placed on the provision under\n\nSection 25D\nof the Industrial Disputes Act by the Hon‟ble Single\n\nJudge is only a misplaced reliance and the said provision of the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\nshall have no manner of application\n\nconcerning the instant dispute between the parties.\n\n17. Finally, according to Mr. Majumder, the calculation of the amount\n\nof gratuity made by the Appellate Authority in his order dated\n\nAugust 25, 2022 is erroneous being based on erroneous\n\nappreciation of the data in the wage slip of the respondent. He says\n\nthat, the days of work and corresponding wages as mentioned in\n\nthe wage slip, has been considered in totality by the said Appellate\n\nAuthority without reducing the amount from there which the\n\nrespondent has already accepted as leave encashment amount.\n\nAccording to him, the amount mentioned in the wage slip was not to\n\nbe reckoned as the daily rate of wages of the respondent in so far as\n\nfrom the same, the days for which leave encashment amount has\n\nPage 14 of 28\n\nbeen withdrawn, were required to be deducted, while calculating the\n\nwage earned by the respondent/workman per day, for the purpose\n\nof calculation of gratuity payable to him. For all the reasons as\n\nmentioned above, the appellant has prayed for an order setting\n\naside the impugned judgment of the Hon‟ble Single Bench dated\n\nMarch 28, 2025 and the order of the Appellate Authority dated\n\nAugust 25, 2022 and upholding the order of the Controlling\n\nAuthority dated October 27, 2016.\n\n18. Mr. R. Guha Thakurta, learned advocate, has represented the\n\nrespondent No. 1/workman in the instant appeal. With reference to\n\nthe fortnightly pay slip, he has submitted that the Appellate\n\nAuthority in his order dated August 25, 2022 has duly and\n\nappropriately considered the same and come to a finding as regards\n\nthe daily wages earned by the respondent during his service. He has\n\nsupported the way as to how on the basis of the daily wages so\n\narrived at, the Appellate Authority has quantified the amount of\n\ngratuity payable to the workman.\n\n19. Mr. Guha Thakurta has on the contrary raised objection as regards\n\nthe order of the Controlling Authority passed in this regard dated\n\nOctober 27, 2016. He submits that the same manifests non-\n\nconsideration of the record and erroneous calculation of gratuity\n\namount.\n\nPage 15 of 28\n\n20. The respondent/workman has raised no serious objection as\n\nregards the span of „continuous service‟ of him as held by the\n\nAppellate Authority that is, for 18 years. Similarly, last drawn wages\n\nas calculated by the Appellate Authority to the tune of Rs. 549.41/-\n\nper day has not been challenged by the respondent/workman.\n\n21. Mr. Guha Thakurta has further contended that an amount of Rs.\n\n99,000/- have already been disbursed to the respondent/workman\n\nas gratuity vide a cheque dated January 30, 2023 and a further\n\namount of Rs. 83,752/- has been deposited with the Registrar\n\nGeneral of this Court by the appellant/company, in terms of the\n\nCourt‟s order, on account of gratuity of the respondent/workman.\n\n22. As a matter of fact, the crux of the dispute between the parties are\n\nnow centralized as to what would be the period of „continuous\n\nservice‟ of the respondent No. 1/workman for his entitlement as to\n\nthe amount of gratuity.\n\n23. Mr. R. Guha Thakurta has relied on the following judgments in\n\nsupport of his argument:-\n\ni) Bank of India Vs. Central Government Industrial Tribunal &\n\nOrs.\nreported at (2010) 4 LLJ 337: 2010 SCC OnLine Cal 1718\n\nPage 16 of 28\n\nii) Phoenix Mills Ltd. Vs. Balasaheb Dagdoo Hinge and Others\n\nreported at 1996 (74) FLR 2086:1996 SCC OnLine Bom 213.\n\niii) M/s.\nKothari Industrial Corporation Vs. Appellate\n\nAuthority and Others\nreported at 1198 LIC 1149: 1997 SCC\n\nOnLine AP 1158.\n\niv) Murlidhar Ratanlal Exports Ltd. Vs. State of West Bengal\n\nand Others\nreported at 2014 (II) LLJ 74: 2014 SCC OnLine Cal\n\n4758.\n\nv) The KCP Employees' Association, Madras Vs. The\n\nManagement of KCP Ltd, Madras and Others reported at 1978\n\n(36) FLR 217: 1978 SCC OnLine SC 23.\n\n24. As per\nsection 2A (1)\nof the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972,\n\n„continuous service‟ is the uninterrupted service period of an\n\nemployee, which includes service which may be interrupted on\n\naccount of „leave‟ or „absence from duty without leave‟. It is\n\nimportant in this case to note the intentions of the lawmakers\n\nexpressed through the words appearing in\nsection 2A(1)\nof the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972 as follows :- \"....not due to any\n\nfault of the employee, whether such interrupted or\n\nuninterrupted service what is rendered before or after the\n\ncommencement of this Act.\"\n\nPage 17 of 28\n\n25. Hence service interrupted by absence has not been outright\n\nexcluded from within the purview and scope of the statute, so far\n\nas determination of the period eligible to be considered for\n\npayment of gratuity to an employee, is concerned.\nSection 4(2)\nof\n\nthe said Act has provided that for every completed year of service\n\nor part thereof in excess of six months, the employer shall pay\n\ngratuity to an employee at the rate of fifteen days wages based on\n\nthe rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned.\nSection\n\n2(b)\nof the Act states that \"completed year of service\" means\n\ncontinuous service for one year.\n\n26. For the purpose of payment of gratuity under provisions of the\n\nsaid Act of 1972, the mandatory, actual physical attendance or\n\nperformance of duty has sometimes been relaxed as seen from the\n\nprovisions of\nsection 2A\nof the said Act. While\nsection 2A(1)\nof the\n\nAct includes the interrupted period of service within the purview of\n\nthe „continuous service‟, on fulfillment of certain conditions,\n\nsection 2A(2)\nthereof has contemplated for deemed „continuous\n\nservice‟ period, when the number of days of performance of duty\n\nby the specified employee, falls short of the minimum required\n\ndays of work within a year.\n\n27. Under\nSection 2A\nof the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the\n\ninterpretation of words \"employment\" and \"continuous service\"\n\nPage 18 of 28\n\nemphasize that service includes periods of authorized or\n\nunauthorized absence that do not indicate an intention to\n\nabandon employment, provided the relationship of employer and\n\nemployee remains unbroken. The continuity of service is\n\nrecognized when there is no termination or clear intention to sever\n\nthe employment, even if there are interruptions such as sickness,\n\nleave, lay-offs, strikes, or lockouts, unless these are deemed to\n\nconstitute a termination or abandonment. \"Continuous service\" is\n\ndefined as uninterrupted service, including interruptions due to\n\nsickness, leave, lay-off, strike, or lockout, unless such\n\ninterruptions are deemed to break the employment relationship.\n\n28. So far as continuity in service or as to what should be construed\n\nas a „continuous service‟, the Supreme Court has held in the cases\n\nin (i) Budge Budge Municipality vs P.R.Mukherjee [AIR 1953 SC\n\n58] and (ii) M/s.\nJeewanlal (1929) Ltd., Calcutta vs Its\n\nWorkmen\n[1961 AIR(SC) 1567], that the words \"continuous\n\nservice\" in the award meant service not broken or interrupted by\n\nthe termination of the contract of employment by either the\n\nemployer or the employee or by operation of law. The Court found\n\nthat the employee's unauthorized absence from work for a period\n\nof 8 and 1/2 months did not amount to a break in service, as it\n\ndid not indicate an intention to abandon his employment. The\n\nCourt held that the continuity of service is disrupted when the\n\nPage 19 of 28\n\nrelationship of master and servant is terminated by resignation,\n\ntermination by the employer, or by operation of law. However,\n\nmere participation in an illegal strike (not concerned in this\n\nappeal) or unauthorized absence from work does not necessarily\n\ncause a break in continuity, unless it is of such a long duration\n\nthat it can be reasonably inferred that the employee intended to\n\nabandon their service.\n\n29. The „employment‟ or „being employed‟ has to be interpreted as\n\ncomprising subsistence of master-servant relationship between the\n\nemployer and the employee and not necessarily compulsorily\n\ndependent on rendering of actual work or being on duty or\n\nperforming the work. The interpretation of \"employment\" and\n\n\"continuous service\" should be contextually examined, considering\n\nwhether the employee's relationship with the employer was\n\neffectively maintained or terminated. Unauthorized absence, if any,\n\ndoes not automatically constitute a break unless there is evidence\n\nof any fault on part of the employee himself, resulting into such\n\nabsence or an intent to abandon employment. The law is well\n\nsettled that an interruption in the period of service not attributable\n\nto the employee concerned, or which may not reasonably lead to\n\nany inference of abandonment of service by him, his service\n\nremains continuous for all the legal and statutory purposes.\n\nPage 20 of 28\n\n30. The appellant‟s contention is that both the Appellate Authority and\n\nthe Hon‟ble Single Judge has erred in holding in favour of the\n\nrespondent No.1/workman, on the basis of so called weakness in\n\ndefence of the appellant rather than any sufficient proof produced\n\nby the respondent himself. In this case, the respondent has not\n\nproduced any evidence or proof of number of completed days of\n\nwork by him in a year. What the respondent has pleaded on\n\naffidavit is his entitlement to the gratuity amount, implying therein\n\nthat he has been in „continuous service‟ with the appellant\n\ncompany, within the scope of the law. Keeping in mind as to what\n\nthe „continuous service‟ would mean and imply in terms of the\n\nstatutory provision, as discussed above, the Court finds that even\n\nin case of interrupted service due to the reason of alleged\n\nunauthorised absence (as it has been pleaded by the appellant in\n\nthe instant appeal), such service shall not be considered to be\n\nbeyond the scope of the statutory provision as regards „continuous\n\nservice‟. The relationship between the parties as the employer and\n\nthe employee has not been severed till the date of superannuation\n\nof the said respondent/workman. This fact is fortified from the\n\nconduct of the appellant itself as it is seen to have allowed the\n\nrespondent/workman to be engaged in the appellant/company, till\n\nthe date of his superannuation.\n\nPage 21 of 28\n\n31. The respondent‟s proof of his contention as regards the period of\n\nhis „continuous service‟, appears to have been discharged, he\n\nhaving pleaded and shown that he has been in employment with\n\nthe appellant/company till July 23, 2013 and no counter, having\n\nbeen brought on record by the present appellant, to suggest that\n\nthe master-servant relationship between them has severed\n\nanywhere in the meantime. The law now is well settled that the\n\nburden of proof rests upon the person who claims, can hardly be\n\nignored. The proposition is upheld by the Supreme Court, in the\n\njudgments of\nRatnagiri Nagar Parishad\n(supra),\nS.T.Harimani\n\n(supra) and the Ganges Manufacturing Company (supra), as\n\nreferred to by the appellant. However, in the particular factual\n\nbackground of the instant case those are not found to be\n\napplicable for the reasons that the workman‟s contentions have\n\nemerged as proved only incontrovertibly, due to the reasons as\n\ndiscussed above. The Court finds that the Appellate Authority as\n\nwell as the Hon‟ble Single Judge has thus come to the findings\n\nthat the respondent/workman has been in „continuous service‟\n\nwith the appellant/company not erroneously but only applying the\n\nright proposition of the law. It has been rightly noted that there is\n\nno contrary fact proved to dislodge the claim of the respondent,\n\nrather the same has been admitted by the appellant by admission\n\nof the fact that he has been indeed allowed to be engaged with the\n\nappellant/company, till the date of his superannuation.\n\nPage 22 of 28\n\n32. Rest is with regard to the period to be considered as continuous\n\nservice period of the respondent/workman, in the\n\nappellant/company, for the purpose of calculation of gratuity\n\npayable to him. Admittedly the respondent/workman has been\n\nregularized on and from December 10, 1995 and his service ended\n\non July 23, 2013. The Appellate Authority thus has found the\n\neligible period of „continuous service‟ of the respondent for the\n\npurpose of payment of gratuity to be for 18 years in total, reversing\n\nthe decision of the Competent Authority in this regard, who earlier\n\nfound the period to be 10 years. Though regarding the finding of\n\nthe Competent Authority the respondent had grievance, the order\n\nof the Appellate Authority dated August 25, 2022 has not been\n\nchallenged by him.\n\n33. Though the order of the Appellate Authority dated August 25, 2022\n\nwas never challenged by the respondent, the Hon‟ble Single Judge\n\nfound it proper to reverse the same in order to include the\n\nundisputed span of service of the respondent as the budli worker\n\nin the appellant company, in to the total period of „continuous\n\nservice‟, that is from the date of his joining till the date of his being\n\nregularized in service, for which the respondent/workman was\n\nsaid to be eligible for gratuity. Generally, Appellate Authorities'\n\nfactual determinations are binding on the Court unless those are\n\nPage 23 of 28\n\nshown to be patently unreasonable or perverse being unsupported\n\nby the evidence. The Courts do not have inherent jurisdiction to\n\nreappreciate factual findings in such cases. In cases under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n, the determination of the period of\n\nservice qualified as \"continuous service\" is a question of fact.\n\nFactual findings by Appellate Authority is generally binding on the\n\nCourt under the doctrine of finality unless shown to be\n\nunreasonable or unsupported by evidence. The workman‟s failure\n\nto challenge or contest a particular factual finding typically\n\nprecludes the High Court from suo motu reversing it. The High\n\nCourt, in its appellate jurisdiction, generally does not reappreciate\n\nfacts but reviews only for legal errors or manifest perversity. The\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Bakshish Singh vs M/s. Darshan\n\nEngineering Works and others reported at (1994) 1 SCC 9, has\n\nheld that the High Court's power under\nArticle 226\nis primarily\n\nsupervisory and extraordinary; it can interfere with factual\n\nfindings only if they are perverse, based on no evidence, or if the\n\nauthority has failed to consider the material evidence. The Court\n\nhas held that the principle of finality of factual findings by\n\nAppellate Authority is well-established. Courts do not have a\n\nroving power to reappreciate evidence in such matters. That the\n\nHigh Court can only interfere if the findings are vitiated by\n\nillegality, perversity, or lack of evidence.\n\nPage 24 of 28\n\n34. There is no such plea in this case. At no point of time the factual\n\nfinding of the Appellate Authority as regards the period of\n\n„continuous service‟ of the respondent/workman for the purpose of\n\npayment of gratuity has been challenged by the respondent, rather\n\nhe has accepted such finding of the Appellate Authority. The\n\nrespondent has not pleaded his grievance before the Court of such\n\nfinding of the Appellate Authority to be vitiated being unreasonable\n\nor unsupported by evidence. Therefore, in absence of any\n\nchallenge as to the same, the High Court ought not to have\n\ninterfered to reverse the same with its own view or opinion.\n\n35. The appellant‟s right to access to justice has caused him to suffer\n\nworse consequences, than the appellant has been subjected to,\n\npursuant to the order which it has been aggrieved about and\n\nchallenged. The Supreme Court in\nBhagubhai Dhnabhai Khalasi\n\n(supra) has held that a party having a grievance must have a\n\nremedy; that access to justice is a human right; that when there\n\nexists such a right a disputant must have a remedy in terms of the\n\ndoctrine ubi jus ibi remedium (where there is right there is remedy);\n\nthat the appellant could not have been placed in a worse position.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of Ashok Kumar Nigam (supra) the 3\n\nJudges Bench of the Supreme Court has held that in appeal the\n\nHigh Court cannot put the appellant in a worse-off position. The\n\nsaid judgments relied on behalf of the appellant should squarely\n\nPage 25 of 28\n\napply to the instant appeal too. The appellant challenges an order\n\nbefore the Court which has been unequivocally accepted by the\n\nrespondent who put forth no grievance whatsoever against it. Even\n\nthen by reversing the same, the appellant has been put in a worse-\n\noff position, which is however, forbidden under the law.\n\n36. The other grievance of the appellant/company is with regard to the\n\nquantum of per day remuneration of the respondent No.\n\n1/workman as arrived at by the Appellate Authority for the\n\npurpose of calculation of gratuity of the said person. It is\n\nsubmitted that the Appellate Authority by modifying the finding of\n\nthe Controlling Authority in this regard, has found the last drawn\n\nwages of the respondent/workman to be Rs. 549.41/- per day, on\n\nthe basis of pay slip (Exhibit C) of the respondent. It is submitted\n\nthat though apparently, from the said pay slip it appears that the\n\nworkman has earned wages to the tune of Rs. 7142.7/- for 13\n\ndays, on which the Appellate Authority has founded its calculation\n\nas regards the per day wages of the workman, the same is only\n\nerroneous in so far as the leave salary already received by the\n\nworkman is included in the amount of pay, as transpires from the\n\nsaid pay slip, whereas the Authority ought to have deducted in\n\nappropriate rate the amount of earned leave encashment by the\n\nconcerned workman. According to the appellant, calculation of per\n\nday wages of the respondent as done by the Controlling Authority\n\nPage 26 of 28\n\nought to have been found to be right and appropriate in this\n\nregard. However, erroneously the Appellate Authority has modified\n\nthe same taking into account the erroneous figures.\n\n37. By relying on the similar proposition of law as discussed above,\n\nthis Court is not willing to interfere into the factual finding of the\n\nAppellate Authority made with respect to the per day wages\n\nquantified for the respondent No. 1/workman, for the purpose of\n\npayment of gratuity.\n\n38. On the basis of the discussion as above, this Court is constrained\n\nto find that the decision of the Hon‟ble Single Judge for payment of\n\ngratuity to the respondent No. 1/workman for a period of 33 years\n\nof his „continuous service‟ with the appellant/company stands to\n\nbe erroneous, baseless and unreasonable. Hence, the said decision\n\nis liable to be set aside. The Court finds this not to be a fit case to\n\ninterfere into the order of the Appellate Authority dated August 25,\n\n2022 in which the Appellate Authority has quantified the amount\n\nof gratuity and interest payable to the respondent No. 1/workman\n\nto the tune of Rs. 1,48,340.70/- and Rs. 1,34,742.81/-\n\nrespectively. It is taken into account that a sum of Rs. 99,000/-\n\nhas already been paid by the appellant in favour of the\n\nrespondent/workman on account of his gratuity amount. It is also\n\nPage 27 of 28\n\nnoted that a sum of Rs. 83, 752/- stands deposited with the\n\nRegistrar General of this Court.\n\n39. Hence, this appeal is partially allowed and disposed of with the\n\nfollowing directions:-\n\ni) The period of continuous service of the respondent/workman\n\nfor the purpose of payment of gratuity is 18 years.\n\nii) The last drawn salary of the respondent/workman for the\n\npurpose of payment of gratuity is Rs. 549.41/-.\n\niii) Therefore, in consideration of Nos. (i) and (ii) as mentioned\n\nabove, the respondent/workman shall be entitled to an amount\n\nof gratuity to the tune of Rs. 1,48,340.70/- and interest for the\n\nperiod from July 24, 2013 to August 24, 2022 to the tune of Rs.\n\n1,34,742.81/-, totaling thereby to a sum of Rs. 2,83,083.51/-.\n\niv) Since Rs. 99,000/- has already been disbursed to the\n\nrespondent/workman on account of part payment of his\n\ngratuity entitlement, let the rest of the amount of total of\n\ngratuity and interest be immediately disbursed by the appellant\n\nin favour of the respondent/workman, excepting the sum of\n\nmoney of Rs. 83,752/- deposited with the Registrar General of\n\nthis Court.\n\nPage 28 of 28\n\nv) The Registrar General of this Court shall immediately release\n\nthe amount of money (to the tune of Rs. 83,752/-) in favour of\n\nthe respondent/workman upon production of valid identity\n\nproof.\n\nvi) The exercise as mentioned in (v) and (vi) should concluded by\n\nthe respective persons within a period of four (04) weeks from\n\nthe date of communication of copy of this judgment.\n\n40. Appeal No. MAT 614 of 2025 is partially allowed and disposed of.\n\n41. Urgent certified copy of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied to\n\nthe parties upon compliance with all requisite formalities.\n\n(Lanusungkum Jamir, J.)\n\n(Rai Chattopadhyay, J.)",
