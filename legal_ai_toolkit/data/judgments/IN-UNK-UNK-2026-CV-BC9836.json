With the consent of the parties, both the appeals\n\n have been heard together and are being disposed of by this\n\n common judgment.\n\n Prosecution case\n\n 6. The informant, namely, Kameshwar Rai (since\n\n deceased/victim) in his fardbeyan recorded on 04.06.2009 at\n\n about 08:00 PM at Referral Hospital, Taraiya in emergency\n\n ward alleged that on the same day at about 06:30 PM, he was\n\n returning his house along with his son Arjun Rai from village\n\n Andharwari after grinding flour. When he reached near the\n\n house of one Rajendra Rai, in the meantime, a motorcycle came\n\n from the side of Taraiya and stopped near the house of Rajendra\n\n Rai and one Baijnath Singh got down from the motorcycle and\n\n with an intention to kill the informant assaulted him by dagger\n\n twice in his ribcage and shoulder due to which he became\n\n unconscious and fell down. Thereafter, he tried to assault the\n\n son of the informant who fled away to save his life. It is further\n\n alleged that the said Baijnath Singh fled away after leaving the\n\n motorcycle. It is further alleged that with the help of the\n\n villagers the informant was taken to Taraiya Hospital where his\n\n treatment is going on. The reason of the alleged incident is the\n\n previous enmity.\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n 4/37\n\n 7. On the basis of the aforesaid fardbeyan of the\n\n informant, a First Information Report being Taraiya P.S. Case\n\n No. 54/2009 dated 04.06.2009 has been registered under\n\n \nSections 341\n, \n324\n and \n307\n IPC against the sole accused Baijnath\n\n Singh. After completion of investigation, police submitted a\n\n charge-sheet bearing number 77/2009 dated 25.09.2009 under\n\n \nSections 341\n, \n323\n, \n307\n and \n302\n IPC against Baijnath Singh.\n\n Upon submission of charge-sheet, the learned Magistrate took\n\n cognizance vide order dated 02.10.2009/05.10.2009. The case\n\n was committed to the court of Sessions on 05.12.2009 where\n\n Sessions Trial No. 675 of 2009 was registered. Vide order dated\n\n 21.12.2009\n charges were framed under \nSection 302\n IPC.\n\n 8. During trial, the prosecution produced as many as\n\n ten witnesses and proved some documentary evidences.

In defence, no oral evidence has been led but\n\n some documentary evidences have been brought on record as\n\n defence evidence.\n\n List of Exhibits on behalf of Defence\n\n Exhibit-A Letter No.7778 sent by Superintendent,\n PMCH to the court\n Exhibit-B Letter No.6143 dated 17.04.2015 sent by\n Superintendent, PMCH to the court\n Exhibit-C Bed head ticket of the deceased\n Exhibit-D Protest Petition dated 29.11.2010 in Taraiya\n\n P.S.

APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 6/37\n\n Findings of the Learned Trial Court\n\n 11. Learned trial court after analyzing the evidences on\n\n the record found that the accused-respondent no.2 was charged\n\n for the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC and the informant\n\n -appellant in his fardbeyan alleged that the accused had\n\n inflicted two knife blows which finds support from the injury\n\n report (Exhibit-4) issued by the doctor of Primary Health\n\n Centre. The prosecution witnesses have deposed that there was\n\n argument between the informant and the accused on the point of\n\n money for tree of Gullar whereafter the accused caused injury\n\n to the informant and thereafter he was treated at Taraiya\n\n hospital from where he was referred to Sadar hospital, Chapra\n\n where x-ray of injured was done but he was not admitted there.\n\n From the Exhibit-E brought by the defence learned trial court\n\n found that injured was treated at Ishwar Dayal Hospital, Patna\n\n and he returned home after getting cured. Thereafter, after 40\n\n days of the occurrence, on 14.07.2009 the injured was admitted\n\n in PMCH.\n\n 12. Learned trial court has held that the informant died\n\n after 50 days of the occurrence. The Medical Officer has in his\n\n report given different reasons which are self-contradictory.\n\n According to the learned court, the act committed by the\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 7/37\n\n accused does not satisfy the essential ingredients of \nSection 300\n\n IPC. In these circumstances, the learned court acquitted the\n\n accused of the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC.\n\n 13. Having taken the aforementioned views, the learned\n\n trial court held that the accused had assaulted the informant\n\n (since deceased) by a dagger as a result whereof the informant\n\n died after 50 days. The learned trial court held that this act of\n\n the accused would come in the category of culpable homicide\n\n as defined under \nSection 299\n IPC. The learned trial court\n\n clearly held that the act of assault by dagger clearly indicates\n\n that the accused had within his knowledge that the act which he\n\n was committing can cause death of the informant. The learned\n\n trial court has recorded that from the post mortem report\n\n (Exhibit '3') issued by the PMCH, it appears that the death of\n\n the informant has occurred because of the infection and\n\n formation of pus in the wound of the stomach.\n\n 14. The learned trial court, however, went to add that\n\n from the oral and documentary evidences of the prosecution, it\n\n is evident that the informant (deceased) had not got his\n\n treatment properly done. Referring to Explanation 2 of \nSection\n\n 299\n of the IPC, the learned trial court held that if appropriate\n\n and skilled treatment would have been provided to the\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 8/37\n\n informant (deceased), the death could have been avoided. The\n\n learned trial court has clearly recorded that the informant (the\n\n deceased) died due to the injury caused by the accused. For\n\n these reasons, the learned trial court has held the accused\n\n (respondent no. 2 in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023) guilty of\n\n the offence under \nSection 304\n Part II of the \nIPC\n. The learned\n\n trial court has awarded a sentence of five years rigorous\n\n imprisonment to the accused with a fine of Rs.20,000/-. In case\n\n of non-payment of fine, the convict shall undergo an additional\n\n imprisonment of three months. The learned trial court has given\n\n benefit of adjustments of the period already spent in\n\n incarceration in terms of \nSection 428\n CrPC (now \nSection 468\n of\n\n the Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)).\n\n 15. On the point of compensation to the victim under\n\n \nSection 357\n A(3), the learned trial court has recommended the\n\n case of the victim to the District Legal Service Authority, Saran,\n\n Chapra under the Bihar Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014 for\n\n providing appropriate compensation.\n\n Submissions on behalf of the Appellant\n in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023\n\n 16. Learned counsel for the appellant in Cr. Appeal\n\n (DB) No. 203 of 2023 has submitted that despite there being\n\n clinching evidence on the record that the respondent no. 2\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 9/37\n\n intentionally caused the injuries which ultimately led to the\n\n death of the informant, the learned trial court has acquitted\n\n respondent no. 2 on a completely irrelevant and extraneous\n\n consideration by taking a view that if proper and skilled\n\n treatment would have been provided to the informant then his\n\n life could have been saved.\n\n 17. Learned counsel submits that the learned trial court\n\n has found in paragraph '21' of the impugned judgment that the\n\n accused had assaulted the informant by dagger and caused\n\n injury. The learned trial court has referred the cause of death\n\n shown in the PMCH report wherein it is said to be caused due\n\n to heart attack. The learned trial court has noticed the post\n\n mortem report of Sadar Hospital, Chapra and the opinion of the\n\n Doctor saying that the death of deceased was caused due to\n\n infection and pus formation. The learned trial court has got\n\n influenced only because the death has taken place due to\n\n infection and pus formation in the wound caused in the stomach\n\n of the deceased.\n\n 18. It is submitted that the learned trial court\n\n misconstrued \nSection 299\n IPC and thereby took a view that\n\n from the evidence led by the prosecution, it appears that the\n\n deceased had not received proper treatment and had he been\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 10/37\n\n properly treated then his death could have been avoided. It is\n\n submitted that such observations of the learned trial court is\n\n completely irrelevant and contrary to Explanation 2 to \nSection\n\n 299\n IPC.\n\n 19. It is further submitted that in this case the date,\n\n time, place and manner of occurrence have been duly proved by\n\n the prosecution. The trial court has accepted the prosecution\n\n story but instead of convicting the accused under \nSection 302\n\n IPC, convicted him under Part II of \nSection 304\n IPC and\n\n awarded a meagre sentence of only five years rigorous\n\n imprisonment with a fine of Rs.20,000/-.\n\n 20. It is submitted that the learned trial court has\n\n grossly erred in appreciation of evidence. There is a complete\n\n misunderstanding of Explanation 2 of \nSection 299\n IPC on the\n\n part of the learned trial court and the Exceptions to \nSection 300\n\n IPC. The learned trial court has not recorded any finding that\n\n the accused had no intention to cause death of the informant.\n\n 21. It is submitted that the act of the accused is covered\n\n under the definition of \nSection 300\n and there was no reason for\n\n the learned trial court to put it within the category of culpable\n\n homicide not amounting to murder and then convict the accused\n\n under Part II of \nSection 304\n IPC.\n\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 11/37\n\n Submissions on behalf of Respondent No. 2\n\n in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023\n\n 22. Mr. Ansul, learned Senior Counsel representing\n\n respondent no. 2 in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023 and\n\n simultaneously arguing the appeal of respondent no. 2 being Cr.\n\n Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023, though initially took a plea that in\n\n this case the place of occurrence has not been duly proved by\n\n the prosecution and the presence of the son of the informant,\n\n namely, Arjun Yadav at the place of occurrence and as an eye\n\n witness cannot be believed but in course of his submissions\n\n when he was confronted with the averments made in the protest\n\n petition (Exhibit 'D') filed by the accused in the court of\n\n learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chapra, Saran vide C 3689 of\n\n 2010 (Exhibit 'D') in which the accused has himself stated\n\n about the occurrence which took place on 04.06.2009 at 04:00\n\n PM in Village Andharwari and has shown the presence of Sabha\n\n Rai, Pintu, Baharan Rai, Sunil Kumar Rai out of whom Baharan\n\n Rai (PW-2) and Sabha Rai (PW-5) have deposed as prosecution\n\n witnesses and then the fardbeyan of Kameshwar Rai which is\n\n the basis of the FIR in which he has clearly stated about the\n\n presence of his son Arun Rai with him at the time of\n\n occurrence, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no. 2 has\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 12/37\n\n not pressed this plea.\n\n \n23. Learned Senior Counsel submits that he would\n\n confine his submissions to the extent that in this case the\n\n alleged injury caused by the respondent no. 2 is not the\n\n proximate cause of death. Learned Senior Counsel has relied\n\n upon a Division Bench judgment of the Hon'ble Madhya\n\n Pradesh High Court in \nImran Khan versus State of Madhya\n\n Pradesh\n reported in 1994 MPLJ 862 to submit that an act is\n\n said to be a cause of death when the death result from the act\n\n itself and from some consequences necessarily or naturally\n\n flowing from the act and reasonably contemplated as its result.\n\n It is his submission in this case the chain of consequences stood\n\n broken as the informant (deceased) was admitted in PMCH\n\n after 40 days of the occurrence and he ultimately died as a\n\n result of the infection suffered and the pus formed in the\n\n wound.\n\n 24. It is his submission that there was an unexpected\n\n complication which would be in the nature of a new mischief\n\n and the relation of cause and effect or the causal connection is\n\n too remote. It is his submission that the proximate cause of\n\n death being the infection and formation of pus in the wound,\n\n the respondent no. 2 would not be liable to be convicted under\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 13/37\n\nSection 302\n IPC. It is his submission that in this case the report\n\n of PMCH as enclosed with the Letter No. 6143 dated\n\n 17.04.2015 (Exhibit 'B') shows that the Doctor noticed on\n\n admission of the informant that it was an old case of stab injury\n\n for which exploratory laprotomy was done in Ishwar Dayal\n\n Hospital where colostomy was done. The Doctor noticed loose\n\n watery stool coming out from colostomy wound and wound\n\n dehiscence. The informant (deceased) remained admitted in\n\n PMCH for about 10 days. He was declared dead clinically on\n\n the basis of the findings: pulse-absent; BP- not recordable; heart\n\n S./breath S.- not audible; pupil- B/L dilated and fixed; mode of\n\n death- cardio pulm. Arrest.\n\n Submissions of the State\n in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023\n\n 25. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State\n\n has opposed Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023. It is submitted\n\n that the challenge to the impugned judgment of conviction has\n\n no plausible basis and it is liable to fail. The learned trial court\n\n has rightly appreciated the entire evidence on the record and\n\n having found that the date, time, place and manner of\n\n occurrence have been duly proved by the prosecution,\n\n convicted the accused for the offence of culpable homicide not\n\n amounting to murder and sentenced him to undergo a rigorous\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 14/37\n\n imprisonment of five years with a fine of Rs.20,000/-.\n\n Consideration\n\n 26. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant in\n\n both the appeals simultaneously and learned Additional Public\n\n Prosecutor for the State.\n\n 27. As recorded hereinabove, in course of hearing of\n\n the appeals, learned Senior Counsel for the convict-appellant in\n\n Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023 has given up his submissions\n\n with regard to the place of occurrence and the credibility of the\n\n eye witness as also finding of the learned trial court that the\n\n cause of death in this case is the injury caused by the accused\n\n but the sole contention of learned Senior Counsel for the said\n\n appellant while arguing on his behalf as respondent no. 2 in Cr.\n\n Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023 is that the death of the informant\n\n (deceased) has resulted due to the new mischief in form of\n\n infection and pus in the wound, therefore, the learned trial court\n\n has not committed any error in convicting the respondent no. 2\n\n only for the culpable homicide not amounting to murder and\n\n punished him under Part II of \nSection 304\n of the IPC.\n\n 28. Notwithstanding the fact that learned Senior\n\n Counsel for the appellant in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023\n\n and respondent no. 2 in Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023 has\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 15/37\n\n confined his submissions, this Court takes it as its' duty to go\n\n through the entire evidences on the record, re-appreciate it and\n\n satisfy itself that the prosecution has duly proved its' case\n\n beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\n 29. We have examined the evidences available on the\n\n record. Binda Raut (PW-1) is an eye witness of the occurrence.\n\n He is a resident of village Andharwari. He has stated that he\n\n was in his house when Kameshwar Rai (the deceased) was\n\n coming after grinding flour and Baijnath Singh also reached\n\n there. His son was also with him. This witness has not stated\n\n any quarrel having taken place in front of his house. He has\n\n stated that Baijnath Singh inflicted dagger in right side on to the\n\n stomach of Kameshwar Rai. Intenstine had come out and\n\n profused bleeding took place. Kameshwar Rai was taken to\n\n hospital at Chapra and from Chapra he was taken to Patna. In\n\n his cross-examination, this witness has stated that the\n\n occurrence had taken place in front of house of Ram Pravesh\n\n Rai. He knows Rajendra Rai and Ram Pravesh Rai who are full\n\n brothers and their houses are within a distance of one meter. He\n\n has stated that Kameshwar Rai came home after one and half/\n\n two months of treatment from hospital but after some\n\n complications occurred in the wound, he again went to the\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 16/37\n\n hospital. This witness has not been suggested by defence that\n\n there was any sudden quarrel between the informant and the\n\n respondent no. 2.\n\n 30. Baharan Rai (PW-2) is another villager of village\n\n Andharwari. He has stated that he heard hulla and when he\n\n reached there then he saw that some altercation was taking\n\n place between Kameshwar Rai and Baijnath Singh, on that,\n\n Baijnath Singh took out a dagger and assaulted Kameshwar Rai\n\n which caused injury at three places. People assembled then they\n\n took Kameshwar Rai to hospital. In his cross-examination, he\n\n has stated that the occurrence has taken place in front of the\n\n house of Ram Pravesh Rai. His house is situated at a distance of\n\n ten laggis from the house of Ram Pravesh Rai. He has\n\n explained that one laggi is equal to ten hands and his house is\n\n situated at a distance of hundred hands. Again, from the\n\n evidence of this witness, it appears that the Respondent No. 2\n\n was armed with dagger and while having some altercation in\n\n form of oral shoutings, he took out the dagger and assaulted the\n\n informant. This witness has seen the occurrence.\n\n 31. Arjun Rai (PW-3) is the son of the deceased. He is\n\n an eye witness to the occurrence. In the fardbeyan, the\n\n informant has stated about the presence of his son Arjun Rai\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 17/37\n\n (PW-3) with him at the time of occurrence. PW-3 has stated that\n\n he was coming with his father by foot after grinding flour from\n\n the flour mill which was kept on a bicycle and when they\n\n reached near the house of Ram Pravesh Rai then from Taraiya\n\n side, Baijnath Singh came on a motorcycle. There was an oral\n\n exchange of words over the Gullar Tree on which Baijnath\n\n Singh took out a dagger and assaulted on the right shoulder of\n\n his father and then he penetrated the dagger in the left side on to\n\n the stomach. This witness tied the wound by his gamchha and\n\n tried to catch hold of Baijnath Singh but Baijnath Singh chased\n\n him to assault. PW-3 has stated that he fled whereafter the\n\n villagers assembled. Baijnath Singh had left his motorcycle\n\n there. The father of this witness was taken to Taraiya Hospital\n\n from where he was referred to Chapra Sadar Hospital and then\n\n from Chapra, he was referred to PMCH but he was taken to\n\n Ishwar Dayal Hospital where he was operated upon. PW-3 has\n\n stated that in course of the treatment, his father died. In Taraiya\n\n Hospital, the statement of his father was recorded, his father\n\n had put his signature on his statement. This witness had also put\n\n his signature on the fardbeyan. He has identified the signature\n\n of his father on the fardbeyan as Exhibit '1' and his own\n\n signature as Exhibit '1/1'.\n\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 18/37\n\n 32. In his cross-examination, this witness has stated that\n\n his home is village-Sitalpatti. Occurrence took place in the\n\n village 'Andharwari'. There are 10/12 houses in village\n\n Andharwari and the houses are situated at a distance of 2-4\n\n steps. He has stated that his father was assaulted for about 10/5\n\n minutes. He was not assaulted and he had not tried to save him.\n\n He had seen the assault by dagger. The pointed part was\n\n penetrated. He has made it clear in his cross-examination that\n\n the house of Rajendra Rai and Ram Pravesh Rai are situated at\n\n a distance of one laggi meaning thereby at a distance of seven\n\n hands. This is important to note because in the fardbeyan the\n\n informant has stated that the occurrence had taken place in front\n\n of the house of Rajendra Rai but in course of evidence it has\n\n transpired that Rajendra Rai and Ram Pravesh Rai are both\n\n brothers and their houses are situated at a distance of one laggi\n\n only.\n\n 33. This Court has, therefore, found that the statement\n\n of the informant that the occurrence had taken place in front of\n\n the house of Rajendra Rai cannot be taken to establish any\n\n dispute with respect to the place of occurrence. It is to be\n\n remembered that the occurrence had taken place in another\n\n village where the deceased had gone with his son for grinding\n Patna High Court CR.

The I.O. has also\n\n established the place of occurrence being in front of the house\n\n of Ram Pravesh Rai. Considering the distance between the\n\n houses of the two brothers being only a distance of seven hands\n\n which is equivalent to one laggi, it cannot be said to be a\n\n material discrepancy.\n\n 34. It is found that in course of cross-examination of\n\n PW-3, he was suggested that Baijnath Singh had also lodged a\n\n case. This witness said that he was not aware of it. Thereafter,\n\n the defence did not prove any documentary evidence to show\n\n that Baijnath Singh had lodged a case. All that has been proved\n\n by defence is a protest petition which has been marked Exhibit\n\n 'D'.\n\n 35. The defence further suggested PW-3 that Baijnath\n\n Singh (accused) had suffered injury but in course of trial, the\n\n defence has not brought on record any injury report of Baijnath\n\n Singh (Respondent No. 2). No oral evidence has been adduced\n\n in this regard even though in protest petition, Baijnath Singh\n\n claimed that he had gone to Chapra Hospital for his treatment.\n\n Thus, the defence has not proved by leading any cogent\n\n evidence that Baijnath Singh had suffered any injury in the said\n Patna High Court CR.

On perusal of the evidence of PW-3 coupled with\n\n the fardbeyan of the informant (Exhibit '2'), it is evident that he\n\n is an eye witness to the occurrence. He is the son of the\n\n deceased. PW-1 has also said about the presence of PW-3 with\n\n his father. PW-3 has withstood the test of cross-examination\n\n and no material contradictions have been shown to this Court in\n\n his evidence. The defence suggested PW-3 that occurrence is\n\n said to have taken place in front of the house of Rajendra Rai\n\n and no occurrence had taken place in front of the house of Ram\n\n Pravesh Rai. PW-3 denied the suggestion.\n\n 36. Surendra Rai (PW-4) is an independent witness of\n\n village Andharwari. He had seen Kameshwar at the place of\n\n occurrence immediately after the occurrence. He has stated that\n\n when he heard hulla at his bathan and went ahead to that place,\n\n he found that Kameshwar Rai had suffered dagger injury in the\n\n left and right side of his stomach. Baijnath Singh had assaulted.\n\n Arjun son of Kameshwar Rai had fled away. Kameshwar Rai\n\n was taken to hospital. This witness is, however, not an eye\n\n witness to the occurrence and he has stated that he had not seen\n\n the assault by dagger.\n\n 37. Sabha Rai (PW-5) is another eye witness to the\n\n occurrence who has stated that there was a talk with regard to\n Patna High Court CR.

He had chased this witness and Arjun (PW-3). This\n\n witness stated that he fled away raising hulla whereafter\n\n villagers assembled. He identified the accused. This witness has\n\n stated in his cross-examination that he is the brother in Gotiya\n\n of Kameshwar Rai. He has given the description of the place of\n\n occurrence. He has stated that in South there is house of Ram\n\n Pravesh and Rajendra. In East, atta-chakki. PW-4 has stated that\n\n he is doing chowkidari. Thus, this witness corroborates the\n\n statement of PW-3 with regard to place of occurrence. He has\n\n stated that blood had fallen on the earth. He has stated that\n\n before he could have reached, Baijnath Singh had already\n\n reached there. When this witness reached there, he saw\n\n Kameshwar Rai was bleeding whereafter he ran and raised\n\n hulla.\n\n 38. Sachidanand Singh (PW-6) is the I.O. of the case.\n\n He has proved the fardbeyan recorded by Asim Khan. It has\n\n been marked Exhibit '2'. He had taken the charge of\n\n investigation and proceeded to the place of occurrence on\n\n 05.06.2009. He was shown the place of occurrence by Baharan\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 22/37\n\n Rai (PW-2). The I.O. has proved the place of occurrence as the\n\n pucci road North to the house of Ram Pravesh Rai. Road is\n\n East-West. He has given the description of the place of\n\n occurrence. He has stated that he did not find any noticeable\n\n thing. The road is a very busy road. He recorded the statement\n\n of witness. Later on, he came to know that the injured died\n\n during his treatment. He had received the post-mortem report\n\n and had filed the chargesheet.\n\n In his cross-examination, he has stated to have recorded the\n\n re-statement of Kameshwar Rai at Sitalpatti. When he had\n\n recorded the re-statement of Kameshwar at that time, he had\n\n wounds, when there was some healing he had come back but\n\n thereafter his condition worsened and he again went to Patna.\n\n He has stated that there is no counter case of this case. Case No.\n\n 17/10 Taraiya P.S. was registered after this case. This Court has\n\n noticed from the protest petition (Exhibit 'D') that the\n\n informant has mentioned about the case registered on\n\n 15.03.2010 in Taraiya P.S. on the basis of a Complaint Case No.\n\n 1919/09 dated 12.06.2009.\n\n 39. This Court finds that in this case, the date of\n\n occurrence is 04.06.2009. This private complaint was filed after\n\n 8 days of the occurrence. In this case, the respondent no. 2 has\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 23/37\n\n not brought any evidence showing any injury to him. Thus, the\n\n I.O. has stated that there was no counter case of the present\n\n case.\n\n 40. Dr. Muneshwar Prasad Singh (PW-7) was the\n\n Medical Officer in the Sadar Hospital, Chapra who has\n\n conducted autopsy on the dead body of the deceased. He had\n\n found the following injuries:-\n\n \"(i) one partially healed infected wound about 3/4\" x\n 1/4\" on the left side of upper part of abdomen with\n surrounding excoriation of skin.\n\n (ii) One infected wound about 1\"x1\" with\n surrounding 5 stitches with granulation and\n excoriation around the wound.\n\n (iii) The abdomen was open in the mid line upper part\n 6\"x3\" with marks of stitches on the wound margins -\n\n rectus muscle being visible through the gaping wound\n with granulation and infection material over it, bluish\n discolouration in the lower part.\"\n\n 41. PW-7 deposed on the injuries suffered by\n\n Kameshwar Rai which he noticed in course of postmortem. He\n\n has recorded that \"shock and exhaustion due to infection of the\n\n wounds, gaping of the abdominal wound and injury to intestine\n\n were the cause of death\". He has further opined that all the\n\n injuries may be possible by chura. He has proved the post\n\n mortem report which has been marked Exhibit '3'. In his cross-\n\n examination, PW-7 has stated that \"there are many causes of\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 24/37\n\n infection. Carelessness of patient may be one of the causes of\n\n infection. If proper treatment was held, there was least chance\n\n of infection. The pus formation was held in the intestine. The\n\n death of the deceased was caused due to infection and pus\n\n formation\".\n\n 42. It is evident from the deposition of Doctor (PW-7)\n\n that the wound caused to the deceased had developed infection\n\n and pus formation had taken place which proved fatal and the\n\n informant died. Explanation 2 to \nSection 299\n IPC takes care of\n\n this aspect of the matter. It is evident that the death had taken\n\n place because of the injury caused to the deceased.\n\n 43. We have further noticed the evidence of another Dr.\n\n Surendra Prasad Singh (PW-9) who had examined the\n\n informant in the Referral Hospital, Taraiya on 04.06.2009. He\n\n had found the following injuries on his body:-\n\n \"(1) incised wound 2\" x 1\" deep to chest cavity on\n the lower part of the back of chest on the left side.\n (2) Incised wound on the right shoulder joint about\n 1\" x ½\" x skin deep.\n\n Opinion of the both injury reserved and Patient is\n referred to Sadar Hospital Chapra for further and\n proper treatment.\n\n Mark of Identification - a mole on left upper arm.\"\n\n 44. PW-9 has proved the injury report (Exhibit '4'). It\n\n clearly shows that he had found incised wound deep to chest\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 25/37\n\n cavity on the lower part of the back of the chest and incised\n\n wound on the right shoulder joint. Thus, the prosecution story\n\n of two repeated dagger blow inflicted by the accused\n\n (respondent no. 2) has been duly proved.\n\n 45. One of the witnesses, namely, Shri Bhagwan Rai\n\n (PW-8) has been declared hostile. He was cross-examined by\n\n the prosecution and his attention was drawn towards his\n\n previous statement made before police. He has stated in his\n\n cross-examination that he knew Baijnath Singh because he is\n\n Dak Munshi but he did not know about the occurrence.\n\n 46. We have noticed that the prosecution has duly\n\n proved the inquest report (Exhibit '5) and the post mortem\n\n report as also report of the PMCH to show that two repeated\n\n dagger blow were given to the deceased one of which\n\n ultimately proved fatal to the life of the informant\n\n 47. This Court finds that in this case, the prosecution\n\n has proved the date, time, place and manner of occurrence.\n\n Prosecution witnesses are reliable, they have withstood the test\n\n of cross-examination. The defence has, though questioned the\n\n place of occurrence but it is well proved that Ram Pravesh and\n\n Rajendra are brothers, they have their houses besides each other\n\n which is hardly situated at a distance of one 'laggi' only. I.O.\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 26/37\n\n has given the description of the place of occurrence. The\n\n witnesses are consistent that the informant was attacked by\n\n respondent no. 2 (Cr. Appeal (DB) No. 203 of 2023) and he\n\n penetrated dagger into the left side on to the stomach of the\n\n informant.\n\n 48. We have been left with the sole argument of\n\n respondent no. 2 that the proximate cause of death of the\n\n informant in this case is not relatable to the actual death. We\n\n will examine this submission of learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n respondent no. 2 hereinafter.\n\n 49. \nSection 299\n IPC on which the learned trial court has\n\n placed reliance reads as under:-\n\n \"299. Culpable homicide.--Whoever causes death\n by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or\n with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is\n likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is\n likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence\n of culpable homicide.\n\n Illustrations\n\n (a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention\n of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that\n death is likely to be thereby caused.

On a bare perusal of Explanation 2 to \nSection 299\n\n IPC, it would appear that where death is caused by bodily\n\n injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be\n\n deemed to have caused death, although by resorting to proper\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 32/37\n\n remedies and skillful treatment, the death might have been\n\n prevented. The learned trial court has understood otherwise. It\n\n has taken a view that with proper and skillful treatment of the\n\n informant, the death could have been avoided and the infection\n\n as well as formation of pus in the wound is the cause of death.\n\n This seems to have prevailed upon the learned trial court.\n\n 52. Further, we find that the learned trial court has held\n\n that it is a culpable homicide. The learned trial court, however,\n\n erred in taking a view that it is a case of culpable homicide not\n\n amounting to murder. In this case, respondent no. 2 has inflicted\n\n two dagger blows upon the informant. One of the dagger blows\n\n could hit on the shoulder but it is nearer to the neck, luckily the\n\n informant suffered only a skin deep injury on his shoulder but\n\n the another blow was fatal, it hit on a vital part of the body and\n\n there is no iota of doubt that the dagger blows were inflicted\n\n with intention of causing such bodily injury which the\n\n respondent no. 2 knew to be likely to cause death of the person\n\n to whom such an injury is caused and the injuries is sufficient in\n\n an ordinary cause of nature to cause death. The intention of the\n\n appellant to kill the informant is found in the fact that he twice\n\n attacked the informant aiming vital part of the body.

The observations of the learned trial court that had\n\n there been a proper and skilled treatment, the death could have\n\n been avoided, cannot come to the rescue of the accused\n\n (respondent no. 2).\n\n 56. The act of respondent no. 2 is apparently covered\n\n under \nSection 300\n IPC.\n\n 57. We have taken note of the five Exceptions\n\n hereinabove. It is not the case of defence that the dagger blow\n\n was inflicted upon the informant due to any sudden and grave\n\n provocation.

Some of the prosecution witnesses have stated\n\n that there were exchange of words between the informant and\n\n the respondent no. 2 when respondent no. 2 took out a dagger\n\n and assaulted the informant twice. It is not a case of grave and\n\n sudden provocation. The fact that the respondent no. 2 was\n\n carrying a dangerous weapon such as a dagger with him and he\n\n intercepted the informant in another village 'Andharwari',\n\n stabbed him and gave repeated dagger blow only proves that\n\n the accused-respondent no. 2 had intercepted the informant with\n\n a pre-meditation of mind, armed with a weapon in his\n\n possession, he stopped, indulged in exchange of words, took\n\n out his dagger, stabbed the informant and fled away.\n\n \n58. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondent no. 2\n\n has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Madhya\n\n Pradesh in the case of \nImran Khan\n (supra) but we find that\n\n what has been held by the Hon'ble High Court in paragraph\n\n '11' of the judgment would go against respondent no. 2.\n\nParagraph '11' of the judgment in the case of \nImran Khan\n\n (supra) reads as under:-\n\n \"11.

APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 36/37\n\n fatal nature, it makes no difference that death is\n actually caused by a complication naturally\n flowing from the injury and not the injury itself\n since causal connection is proximate.\"\n\n (underline is mine)\n\n 59. In the kind of materials present on the record, we\n\n find that the prosecution has been able to prove a case of\n\n 'murder' as defined under \nSection 300\n IPC. The learned trial\n\n court has erred in acquitting the accused-respondent no. 2 of the\n\n charge under \nSection 302\n IPC. This Court reaches to an\n\n irresistible conclusion that the respondent no. 2 assaulted the\n\n informant with a pre-meditation of mind, intentionally caused\n\n two injuries, one of which hit on the vital part of the body\n\n which was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause\n\n death.\n\n 60. This Court would, therefore, allow the Cr. Appeal\n\n (DB) No. 203 of 2023. The respondent no. 2 is held guilty of\n\n commission of offence punishable under \nSection 302\n IPC. The\n\n conviction of respondent no. 2 is altered from \nSection 304\n Part\n\n II to \nSection 302\n IPC.\n\n 61. For the reasons discussed hereinabove, we find no\n\n merit in Cr. Appeal (SJ) No. 119 of 2023. Hence, Cr. Appeal\n\n (SJ) No. 119 of 2023 is dismissed.\n\n Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.203 of 2023 dt.05-05-2025\n\n 37/37\n\n 62. The respondent no. 2 is on bail. His bail bond is\n\n cancelled and he is taken into custody. He will be sent to Beur\n\n Jail for the present.\n\n 63. As prayed by learned Senior Counsel for\n\n respondent no.2, the records are kept for hearing on sentence\n\n day after tomorrow i.e. 07.05.2025. Respondent No.2 shall be\n\n produced before this Court on 07.05.2025 at the time of hearing\n\n on sentence.\n\n (Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J)\n\n ( Ashok Kumar Pandey, J)\narvind/sushma2-\n\nAFR/NAFR AFR\nCAV DATE 01.05.2025\nUploading Date 05.05.2025\nTransmission Date 05.05.2025",

The decision may not be\n so easy in a case where death is caused not\n directly by the injury itself, but due to a\n complication or development or in a case where\n death is delayed or due to a later complication or\n development, court has to consider the nature of\n the injury, complication or development and\n attendant circumstances. If the complication or\n development is the natural or probable or\n necessary consequence of the injury and if it is\n reasonably contemplated as its result, the injury\n can be said to have caused death. If, on the other\n hand, the chain of consequences is broken or if\n there is unexpected complication causing new\n mischief, the relation of cause and effect is not\n established or the causal connection is too\n remote and the injury cannot be said to have\n cause death.
