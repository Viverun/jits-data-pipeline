Mr.D.Shanmugaraja Sethupathi\n^For 1st respondent ... Mr.S.Kumar,\n Addl. Government Pleader\nFor respondents ... Mr.V.Illanchezian\n 2 to 53\n\n:ORDER\n\n Challenge in this writ petition is to a common order, dated 22.04.2009,\npassed by the Appellate Authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n (The Joint\nCommissioner of Labour), Madurai, directing the petitioner Bank to pay the\narrears of gratuity payable to the respondents 2 to 53.\n\n 2.The Special Officer/Joint Registrar of the Virudhunagar District Central\nCo-operative Bank Ltd., Virudhungar, the petitioner herein has submitted that\nVirudhunagar District Central Co-operative Bank is incorporated under the \nTamil\nNadu Co-operative Societies Act\n and the Rules made thereunder, and that the Bank\nis having registered by-laws and special by-laws, in respect of the service\nconditions of the employees, in accordance with the provisions of the \nTamil Nadu\nCo-operative Societies Act\n.\n\n 3. According to the petitioner bank, respondents 2 to 53, who were the\nemployees of the petitioner Bank and retired from service, on attaining the age\nof superannuation on various dates and they have received the entire gratuity,\ndue to them, as per the scheme viz., Group Gratuity (Cash Accumulation) Scheme,\nwhich is linked with Life Insurance Corporation of India.\n\n 4. It is the case of the petitioner that the respondents 2 to 53 filed an\napplication before the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Madurai, the first\nrespondent herein, claiming that they are entitled to receive further amount of\ngratuity, notwithstanding the claim made already, as per the settlement, dated\n05.03.1997, arrived at under \nSection 12(3)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, which\naccording to them, provides for more benefit than the Act.\n\n 5. As per \nSection 4(A)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the petitioner Bank\nhad framed a scheme viz., Group Gratuity Scheme linked with Life Insurance\nCorporation of India. It is submitted that as per the said scheme, an employee\nis entitled to get 15 days wages for every completed year of service, as\ngratuity, subject to a maximum of the amount, equaling to 20 months salary. The\nabovesaid term emanated from the scheme in respect of payment of gratuity has\nbeen included in the settlement, dated 05.03.1997, arrived at, between the Bank\nand various Employees Unions, in accordance with \nSection 12(3)\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act. Further the above term of the settlement also says that for the\npurpose of calculation of Gratuity, 26 days would be reckoned, as a month, not\nonly for arriving at the pay, but also for calculation for the length of\nservice.\n\n 6. It is the further case of the petitioner Bank that the respondents 2 to\n53 have filed applications before the Controlling Authority, viz., the first\nrespondent herein, claiming difference of gratuity, relying on the above terms\nstated in the settlement. According to the petitioner Bank, the respondents 2\nto 53 were misconstrued the term of the settlement, as if every 26 days would\nform a month and as such, the calculation of length of service would be long\nyear than the actual working years and that if such method is adopted, then a\nyear with 365 days would have 14 months and the same would lead to absurdity.\n\n 7. The petitioner Bank has further stated that the Supreme Court in\nDigvijai Woolen Mills Case reported in 1980(4) SCC 106 has held that in any\nfactory, an employee never works for all the 30 days in a month, and he gets 4\nSundays in a month and that though a month is understood to mean 30 days, but\nthe manner of calculating gratuity under the Act to the employee who works for\n26 days, should be on the basis for what he gets for 26 working days.\nReiterating the same view, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Jeewanlal Ltd. case\nreported in 1984 (4) SCC 356 has held that the \"rate of fifteen days wages' of\nan employee mentioned in \nSection 4(2)\n has to be calculated by ascertaining his\ndaily wages by dividing the monthly wages by 26 and multiplying it by 15.\n\n 8. According to the petitioner Bank, subsequent to the above judgments of\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court, an amendment was brought about in \nSection 4\n of the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, inserting an explanation that \"in the case of a monthly\nrated employee, the 15 days wages shall be calculated by dividing the monthly\nrate of wages last drawn by him by dividing 26 and multiplying the quotient by\n15, and therefore, the above term of settlement dated 05.03.1997 has been\nincorporated in conformity with the explanation inserted in \nSection 4\n of the\nPayment of Gratuity Act.\n\n 9. According to the petitioner Bank, vide Letter No.8571/CC1/98-10, dated\n20.11.2001, the Government have issued an amendment deleting the entire term of\nthe particular settlement and consequently, after issuing notice under \nSection\n9(A)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Special Officer of the petitioner Bank\nhas passed an order vide R.C.No.1386/200-2001/E.1, dated 18.09.2002, confirming\nto the change made in the settlement. When the above order of the Special\nOfficer was challenged by the Employees Union before this Court in W.P.No.40604\nof 2002, this Court, vide order dated 25.07.2008, dismissed the same holding\nthat the above Government Letter and consequential order of the Special Officer\nis in conformity with law. Hence, as on date, the excess amount claimed by the\nemployee, relying on the relevant term of the settlement, cannot be granted.\n\n \n10. It is further stated by the petitioner Bank that as regards the\ndispute between the petitioner Bank and the respondents 2 to 53 is pertaining\nto the gratuity payable under the group gratuity scheme linked with Life\nInsurance Corporation of India, as mentioned in the settlement under \nSection\n12(3)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, the first respondent has no jurisdiction\nto entertain the dispute under \nSection 7(4)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act.\nAccording to the petitioner Bank, the principle applied by the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in \nState of Punjab Vs. Labour\n Court, Jullunder, reported in 1980(1) SCC 4\nthat any claim under the Act only could be made before the Authority prescribed\nby the Act and \nthe said decision\n is equally applicable to the facts of this\ncase, as in this case also, the claim under the settlement, which did not come\nunder the purview of the Act, has been claimed before the Authority under the\nAct.\n\n 11. According to the petitioner Bank, the first respondent, authority\nunder the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, has no jurisdiction to decide the disputes,\non the interpretation of 12(3) settlement, in view of \nSection 36(A)\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, which contemplates that if any difficulty or doubt\narises as to interpretation any provision or any award or settlement, the\nappropriate Government shall refer the question to such Labour Court, Tribunal\nor National Industrial Tribunal, as it may think fit. For the aforesaid\nreasons, the petitioner bank has sought for quashment of the common order, dated\n22.04.2009.\n\n 12. Denying all the contentions raised in the affidavit filed in support\nof the writ petition and praying to vacate the interim stay granted by this\nCourt on 16.06.2009, the General Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Bank's\nRetired Employees Federation, Chennai, representing the respondents 2 to 53, in\nthe counter affidavit filed in support of the vacate stay petition has stated\nthat this writ petition is not maintainable, either in law or on facts, as there\nis an alternative remedy under \nSection 7(7)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act and\nthat the petitioner Bank, with the intention to evade the deposit of the amount\nordered by the controlling authority, has approached this Court with the writ\npetition.\n\n 13. It is further stated that as per Clause 17 of the Settlement under\n\nSection 12(3)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, dated 05.03.1997, all the\nrespondents 2 to 53 have filed separate petitions for payment of gratuity,\nbefore the controlling authority with a delay and that the same was allowed. He\nhas further submitted that though the petitioner Bank has challenged the said\norder before the appellate authority, the same was confirmed and subsequently\nthis Court, in W.P.No.1712 of 2004, has also confirmed the said order.\nThereafter, the petitioner bank has filed W.A.No.457 of 2008 and vide order\ndated 22.09.2008, the appeal was disposed of by the Division Bench of this\nCourt. According to the respondents 2 to 53, the term Gratuity has been\nmentioned as a separate clause, in the settlement dated 05.03.1997 under \nSection\n12(3)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, for arriving payment of gratuity, which is\napplicable to the respondents 2 to 53. It is further submitted that the\ncalculation of one day salary, has to be taken from the last pay drawn divided\nby 26.\n\n 14. According to the respondents 2 to 53, as per the judgment of the Apex\nCourt, a settlement arrived between the parties under \nSection 12(3)\n of the\nIndustrial Dispute Acts, has to be replaced only by way of another settlement\nand not by a letter from the Government. It is further stated by the\nrespondents 2 to 53 that though the writ petition filed by the respondents 2 to\n53, challenging the order of cancellation of term of settlement, has been\ndisposed by the Principal Bench of this Court, vide order dated 25.07.2008, the\nappeal filed against that order in W.A.No.1686 of 2009 is still pending.\nAccording to the respondents 2 to 53, the controlling authority had not at all\nmade any interpretation of the term \"settlement\" under \nSection 12(3)\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act and that therefore, the Government or the Registrar of\nCo-operative Societies or the Management have no authority to cancel or modify\nor alter the 12(3) Settlement, unilaterally, and any alteration or modification\nor cancellation must be done only by a subsequent 12(3) Settlement. For the\nabovesaid reasons, the respondents 2 to 53, prayed to vacate the stay granted in\nM.P.(MD).No.1 of 2009 in W.P.(MD).No.9327 of 2009, dated 16.09.2009 and\nconsequently, dismiss the writ petition.\n\n 15. Heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials\navailable on record.\n\n 16. Though several contentions have been raised on merits, for and against\nthe impugned order, this Court deems it fit to address the preliminary issue,\nraised in this writ petition, as to whether the Assistant Commissioner of\nLabour, Madurai, has jurisdiction to entertain the dispute, under the Payment of\nGratuity Act The factual dispute as could be deduced from the pleadings is\nwhether the computation of the period for calculating gratuity should be on the\nbasis of wages for 26 days in a month, though the number of days in a month is\n\n30. Whether such dispute attracts the provision under \nSection 7 (4)\n of the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, empowering the controlling authority to adjudicate the\ndispute, and whether the terms of the settlement under \nSection 12(3)\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, can be subject matter of a dispute, falling under\n\nSection 7(4)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act.\n\n 17. Admittedly, the dispute between the Management of Virudhunagar\nDistrict Central Bank Limited and its employees, pertains to entitlement and\ncomputation of gratuity, payable under the Group Gratuity linked with the Life\nInsurance Corporation of India, as per the Settlement under \nSection 12(3)\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act. In order to address the issue of jurisdiction, let me\nconsider the decisions relied on by the learned counsel appearing for both\nsides, which are as follows:\n\n \n(\na) Gujarat State Export Corporation Ltd., Vs.

Madhusudan\nL.Khandwala and another\n, reported in 2004 (II) LLJ 389, the High Court of\nGujarat has considered a case where a Company Secretary and Senior Manager, who\nhad put in 28 years of service, sought for enforcement of a private scheme of\ngratuity and for a direction, for payment of the differential amount, contending\ninter alia that, in the private scheme, he was entitled to higher gratuity\namount. The controlling authority has accepted the contention. The corporation\nfiled an appeal, which has been dismissed. The decision has been challenged in\nthe High Court, wherein the learned counsel for the Corporation has mainly\ncontended that the controlling authority has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the\nclaim of the respondent, as the same was not flowing from the provisions of the\nAct. On merits, it was contended that an employee cannot insist for payment of\ngratuity under the private scheme, wherein the maximum limit was only 20 months.\nOn the aspect of jurisdiction, it has been contended that the controlling\nauthority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n has no jurisdiction.\n \nReliance has\nalso been placed on the decision of the Kerala High Court in the matter of\n\nAyyappan Vs. Joint Labour Commissioner\n, reported in 1999 (II) LLJ 1351 (Ker).\nPer contra, the learned counsel for the Company Secretary and Manager has\ncontended that the controlling authority has the jurisdiction and made\nsubmissions on merits. After considering the rival submissions, with reference\nto the provisions Clauses (a) & (b) of the Sub \nSection 4\n of \nSection 7\n of the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, which states that (a) if there is any dispute as\nto the amount of gratuity payable to an employee under this Act or as to the\nadmissibility of any claim of or in relation to an employee for payment of\ngratuity, or as to the person entitled to receive the gratuity, the employer\nshall deposit with the controlling authority such amount, as he admits to be\npayable by him as gratuity and (b) Where there is a dispute with regard to any\nmatter or matters specified in clause (a) the employer or employee or any other\nperson raising dispute may make an application to the controlling authority for\ndeciding the dispute, at paragraph No.12, the Gujarat High Court has held as\nfollows;\n\n \"12. Mr.Master, the learned advocate placed reliance on the following\ndecisions to contend that the Controlling Authority can entertain a claim on the\nbasis of settlements.\n\n(i) Ramjilal Chimanlal Sharma Vs. M/s Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Mill Co.\nLtd. and another, reported in 1984 LAB IC 1703 (Bombay High Court);\n\n(\nii) Dholpur Kraya Vikraya Sahkari Samiti Ltd. Vs. Controller\n under \nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n, Bharatpur and others, reported in 2000 (I) LLJ 663 (Rajasthan High\nCourt);\n\n(\niii) Eastern Coal Fields Ltd. Vs. Regional Labour Commissioner (Central) and\nothers\n, reported in 1982 (44) FLR 365 (Calcutta High Court);\n\n(iv) Decision of the Honourable the Apex Court in the matter between \nState\nGovernment Pensioners' Association and others Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh\n,\nreported in (1986) 3 SCC 501;\n\n \nThese decisions have no application to the facts of the present case,\nhence the same are not discussed in detail. As against that the decision in case\nof \nAyyappan\n (supra) of Kerala High Court is referred and relied upon by Mr.Patel\nwherein it is held that the Controlling Authority can order payment of gratuity\nonly in terms of the Act. No decision of the Honourable the Apex Court on the\npoint is cited. In considered opinion of this Court, the benefits, to the extent\nthe same are flowing from the provisions of the \nGratuity Act\n, the Authority\nunder the Act has power to adjudicate for the same. But if benefits sought for\nare arising from a settlement or private scheme, the same cannot be agitated\nbefore the Authority under the Act.\"\n\n 19. \nIn \nGujarat State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Chandrakant Tabubhai\nVyas\n, reported in 2004 (III), LLJ 86, the question for consideration, was as to\nwhether any statutory liability was attracted for payment of gratuity, as per\n\nSection 4(2)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 and on account of subsequent\nrevision of pay scale, after the date of retirement amount or not. The second\nquestion, which incidentally arose for consideration of the Gujarat High Court,\nwas what shall be the consequential order, in view of the subsequent change in\ncircumstances, from the date of filing of the application before the controlling\nauthority under the Act, till the pendency of the petition, more particularly,\nwhen the same related to retiral benefits of the employees. After considering\nthe scope and ambit of \nSection 4(2)\n of the Payment of Gratuity Act, which reads\nthat for every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six\nmonths, the employer shall pay gratuity to an employee at the rate of 15 days'\nwages, based on the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned and sub\n\nSection 4\n of \nSection 7\n of the Act which reads that if there is any dispute as to\nthe amount of gratuity payable to an employee under this Act or as to\nadmissibility of any claim under the Act, the employer shall deposit with the\ncontrolling authority such amount, as he admits to be payable by him as gratuity\nand also, after considering clause (c) of sub \nSection 4\n of \nSection 7\n of the Act\nwhich states that the controlling authority, shall after due enquiry and after\ngiving the parties to the dispute a reasonable opportunity of being heard,\ndetermined the matter or matters in dispute, at paragraph No.6 the Gujarat High\nCourt observed that ;\n\n \"6.The employees concerned in the present case asserted their right for\nadmissibility of the payment of gratuity is upon revision of pay-scale whereas\nthe employer-petitioner has denied the liability on the question of not\nproviding by way of settlement expressly for payment of gratuity. As such, on\na conjoint reading of \nSections 4\n and \n7\n it appears that the jurisdiction of the\ncontrolling authority would be attracted only if there is statutory liability to\npay the amount of gratuity, and there is non-payment by the employer concerned.\nFurther, even if the power under \nSection 7\n are construed for entertaining the\nclaim of gratuity in purported exercise of the right to receive gratuity, then\nalso the controlling authority, while exercising the admissibility of the claim\nwill have to decide as to whether such claim is legally admissible or not. At\nthe time when such aspect is to be considered, the authority shall be guided by\nthe provision of the Act for accrual of liability to pay the gratuity and for\naccrual of the right to receive the amount of gratuity.\"\n\n 20. \nIn \nAyyappan Vs. Joint Labour Commissioner\n, reported in 1999 (II) LLJ\n1351 (Kerala), considered in \nGujarat State Export Corporation Limited\n Case [2004\n(2) LLJ 389], the dispute was whether the controlling authority was right in\nordering gratuity payable to the applicant therein, who retired from service and\nthe question that came up for consideration was, whether there could be a\nclassification between those who retired from service or resigned from service.\nAfter considering the rival submissions, the Kerala High Court in paragraph\nNos.3 & 4 held as follows;\n\n \"3. A reading of the entire provisions of \nSection 4\n makes it clear that\ngratuity payable under the Act is limited to 15 days wages for every completed\nyear and an employee can claim gratuity from the employer if he is entitled for\nbetter terms in accordance with any other better provisions of conditions of\nservice. Therefore, the gratuity in terms of Clause 9 of Ext. Government order\nproviding for one month's wages for every completed year is not the gratuity\npayable under the Act.\n\n 4. \nSection 7\n of the Act enables an employee to approach the controlling\nauthority for determination of the amount towards gratuity. \nSection 7\n can be\ninvoked only by \"a person who is eligible for payment of gratuity under this\nAct.\" The gratuity claimed by the petitioner is not under this Act but under\nExt. P2. \nUnder the Act\n the petitioner is entitled only to the rate as mentioned\nin Sub-\nsection 2\n of \nSection 4\n The amount granted in Ext. P4 is equal to that\nrate. Therefore, limiting of the gratuity payable to the petitioner under the\nAct to 15 days' wages for every completed year as contained in Ext. P4 is\njustified though on a different ground. On that basis, the petitioner cannot\nchallenge the quantum of gratuity directed to be paid in Ext. P4. Therefore, Ext\nP4 to that extent alone is upheld. But the finding that Ext. P2 is not\napplicable to the petitioner is set aside and left open.\"\n\n 21. \nIn \nSivaraman Nair Vs. The Plantation Corporation of Kerala Ltd.\n,\nreported in 2005(1) KLT page 1, the employees of the Plantation Corporation of\nKerala Limited, a Government of Kerala undertaking, on their retirement were\npaid gratuity by the employer. Believing that they were entitled to a better\ndeal, the employees approached the controlling authority under the \nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n. According to them, full and eligible gratuity payable to them was\nheld back and that therefore, they sought for a direction. They also claimed\nthat the rate should be maintained, as one month wages for every completed years\nof service, on the ceiling, as prescribed under the Act. \nUnder the Payment of\nGratuity Act\n, the rate is 15 days wages per year of service, with a maximum\nlimit of Rs.3.5 lakhs. In the said case, the Government have issued orders, as\nearly as in 1989 to the effect that the employees were entitled to get gratuity,\nfor every completed years of service and at that time, an upper limit of\nRs.50,000/- had been fixed, as the maximum gratuity payable, by the Government\nOrder. It was latter revised by the Government in G.O.Ms.No.50/96/AD, dated\n03.02.1996, whereby, the maximum limit was increased to Rs.1 lakh and after this\nrevision, there was no subsequent Government Order, enhancing the upper limit.\n\n \n22.The employer \nin \nthe above case\n paid the maximum limit, as per the\nGovernment Order and on this aspect, the employees had approached the\nControlling Authority, with a claim that full entitlement has not been extended\nto them. Their claim that one month's salary for every completed year of\nservice and the upper limit of Rs.3.5 lakhs was not accepted by the Controlling\nAuthority. But the authority directed that the petitioners would be entitled to\ngratuity payable under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, i.e., at the rate of 15 days\nsalary per year for every completed year of service as it would have been more\nadvantageous. The Controlling Authority rejected the contention of the\npetitioner that the rate has to be maintained, at one month salary, for every\ncompleted years of service. Though the authority had gone into the merits of\nthe claim, the said authority also held that, it has no jurisdiction to\npronounce upon a claim, as to whether it falls within and not, in accordance\nwith the parameters, prescribed under the Act. The Controlling Authority also\nmaintained that he had no jurisdiction to travel beyond the statute and limits,\nnor was enjoying powers of original jurisdiction. The appellate authority also\nconfirmed the orders, which resulted in the challenge before the High Court.\n\nAfter considering the decisions made in Ramilal C.Sharma Vs. Elphinstone\nSpinning and Weaving Mill Co. Ltd., reported in 1984 Lab.I.C. 1703 and State of\nPunjab Vs. Labour Court, Jullunder reported in 1981 (I) LLJ 354; \nEastern Coal\nFields Ltd., Vs. Regional Labour Commissioner (Central), Calcutta and others\n\nreported in 1982 (II) LLJ 324; and \nAyyappan Vs. Joint Labour Commissioner\n (1298\n(2) KLT 399), the Kerala High Court at paragraph Nos.10, 11, 13 & 14 held as\nfollows;\n\n \"10. \nThe Gratuity Act\n prescribes that the payment is. of general\napplication. It may be permissible for the parties, namely, the employees and\nemployers to agree upon any terms of payment of gratuity, different from the one\nprescribed under the Act. Only restriction is that such agreement should not\nresult in a payment of gratuity which is lesser than what is provided by the\nAct. There is nothing in the Act or \nSection 4\n to indicate that in respect of\ncalculation, the rates prescribed by the Government orders could be taken notice\nof, and for the purpose of ceiling limit, the prescription under the \nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n is adoptable. Option is for the workmen to claim benefits as per\nthe condition of service or in the alternate, request for applying the statutory\nterms. The legal position as above has been correctly understood by the\nAuthorities when they had examined the claims presented by the workmen.\n\n 11. Reliance had been placed by the petitioners on a decision of the\nBombay High Court, Ramilal C. Sharma v. Elphinstone Spinning and Weaving Mill\nCo. Ltd. (1984 Lab.I.C. 1703). The Court had observed that claim for granting\ngratuity on the basis of a settlement also could be entertained under the Act.\nThe objection as above had been overruled by the Court, holding that being a\nbeneficial piece of legislation, it should be construed in a manner which would\nadvance the cause of justice. \nThe Court, of course, noticed that a claim for\ngratuity under the Act was to be exclusively tried by the Controlling Authority\nunder the Act, as laid down by the Supreme Court in \nState of Punjab v. Labour\n\nCourt, Jullunder (1981 (I) LLJ 354). In the case before it, gratuity was being\nclaimed on the basis of a settlement, and the Controlling Authority had\njurisdiction to take cognisance of the claim, as it pertained to gratuity, as\nwhat was brought about by the settlement was only to vary the rate of amount.\n\nThe Court had also adverted to a judgment of Calcutta High Court in \nEastern Coal\nFields Ltd. v. Regional Labour Commissioner (Central), Calcutta and Ors.\n (1982\n(II) LLJ 324). Copy of two judgments have been produced as Exts.P3 and P4\nrespectively.\n\n 13. Therefore, the Controlling Authority could have determined a claim as\nexclusively coming under the Act alone. Of course, a claim for gratuity other\nthan that coming within the purview of the Act could have been adjudicated under\n\nSection 33-C(2)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act, by a Labour Court. In such a\ncase also, possibly the adjudication could have been only as prescribed by the\nsettlement, and simultaneously taking notice of the ceiling as it always was to\noperate as a package deal. In short, the petitioners had to face restrictions at\none point or another, viz., at the rate prescribed by the Government Orders, and\nwith a ceiling prescribed by the order, or purely under the Act. The claims as\npresented therefore were ambitious, but without legal backing.\n\n 14. I do not think that the Controlling Authority or Appellate Authority\nhad committed any error in comprehending the issue. The Original Petitions are\ndismissed.\"\n\n 23. \nIn \nThomas Kurian Vs. Idukki District Co-operative Bank Limited\n,\nreported in 2003 (199) FLR 154, the petitioner therein, a retired General\nManager of Idukki District Co-operative Bank Limited, has filed an original\npetition for quashing Ex.P8, arbitration proceedings, before the arbitrator and\nalso prayed for a declaration to declare, that the question regarding the\ngratuity has to be decided by the fifth respondent therein, the controlling\nauthority constituted under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n. The petitioner\ntherein has contended that he was eligible for an amount of Rs.4,92,692/-,\nwhereas, the Bank issued a notice to him, that an excess amount of Rs.77,000/-\nhas been disbursed to the petitioner towards gratuity and that the said amount\nwas liable to be returned, with interest of 18%. The Bank also filed Ex.P8,\narbitration case before the arbitrator for recovery of the alleged excess\namount. The petitioner has filed Ex.P12, an application before the Controlling\nAuthority, claiming the balance amount, due towards gratuity. He has also filed\nan original petition for quashing Ex.P8, proceedings pending before the\narbitrator and for a declaration that the controlling authority constituted\nunder the \nGratuity Act\n alone is competent to decide the dispute regarding the\nquantum of gratuity and not the Arbitrator. After considering the rival\nsubmissions, at para 6 of the judgment, the Kerala High Court held that the\nControlling Authority has no jurisdiction.\n\n \"6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in view of the\nprovision in Clause 21(A) \"For this purpose the \nPayment of Gratuity Act (Central\nAct\n) or this provision, whichever is beneficial will be applicable\", the\npetitioner would be entitled to the amount of gratuity calculated in accordance\nwith the above provision in the service regulation. But by exhibit P-1 circular\nissued by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies the gratuity had been limited\nto the amount payable in accordance with the provisions of the \nGratuity Act\n. In\nview of exhibit P-1 Circular No. 25/99, dated June 22, 1999, an employee would\nbe entitled to claim gratuity payable only in accordance with the provisions of\nthe \nGratuity Act\n and he was not entitled to any amount in excess of the same. As\nthe amount paid to the petitioner towards gratuity was in excess of the amount\nfixed under Sub-section (3) of \nSection 4\n of the Act, the audit department\nobjected to the excess payment and in pursuance of the same, exhibit P-4 notice\nwas issued to the petitioner for refund of the excess amount. The petitioner\nfiled objections contending that he was entitled to furthermore amount in view\nof the provisions in the revised service regulations. As the petitioner was not\nready to repay the excess amount collected by him, the bank filed arbitration\nproceedings before the arbitrator and thereafter the petitioner filed exhibit P-\n\n12 application before the Controlling Authority constituted under \nSection 3\n of\nthe Gratuity Act claiming further amount. Learned counsel for the first\nrespondent submitted that the maximum amount payable under Sub-section (3) of\n\nSection 4\n of the Gratuity Act is Rs. 3.5 lakhs and the bank is not disputing the\npetitioner's claim for Rs. 3.5 lakhs. The Controlling Authority constituted\nunder the \nGratuity Act\n can consider the claim of an employee in accordance with\nthe provisions of the \nGratuity Act\n and can sanction me maximum amount or Rs. 3.5\nlakhs prescribed under Sub-section (3). In view of \nSection 5\n of the Act, the\nControlling Authority can allow in excess of the maximum prescribed under Sub-\nsection (3), if there, was any provision in the bye-law or any agreement with\nthe employer entitling for higher amount. But in the present case, by exhibit P-\n1 circular, the gratuity payable to an employee was limited to the amount\npayable under the \nGratuity Act\n. The Controlling Authority constituted under the\n\nGratuity Act\n is incompetent to consider the legality or propriety of exhibit P-1\ncircular as he does not have any authority or jurisdiction to consider the same.\nWhen the right to get the maximum amount of gratuity under the \nGratuity Act\n is\nnot disputed by the bank, the Controlling Authority has no jurisdiction in\nadjudicating the dispute regarding the excess amount paid to the employee. As\nthe dispute is relating to the payment of an amount in excess of the amount\nprescribed under Sub-section (3) of \nSection 4\n of the Gratuity Act and that being\na dispute between the employer and employee, it has to be adjudicated by the\narbitrator under \nSection 69\n of the Co-operative Societies Act. \nThe Co-operative\nSocieties Act\n envisages a dispute between the employer and the former employee\nalso to be decided by arbitration. Hence, exhibit P-8 proceedings initiated by\nthe bank before the arbitrator is in accordance with law and has to be proceeded\nwith. In the present case, the Controlling Authority cannot have any\njurisdiction in the matter, as the dispute relates to the claim regarding the\nexcess amount paid which is beyond the purview of the \nGratuity Act\n. Hence, the\nreliefs prayed for in this original petition cannot be allowed.\"\n\n Ultimately, in the above reported case, the Kerala High Court held that\nthe arbitration pending before the Arbitrator shall be proceeded with, whereas,\nthe proceedings of the controller shall be dropped.\n\n 24. \nIn a recent decision of the Apex Court, in \nAllahabad Bank and others\nVs. All India Allahabad Bank Retired Employees Association\n (2010(2) SCC 44) =\n(2010) 2 SCC 44, one of the issues considered by the Supreme Court was, whether\nthe controlling authority has jurisdiction under the Act to deal with any issue,\nunder Sub \nSection 5\n of \nSection 4\n and as to whether the terms of gratuity\npayable under any award or agreement or contract was more beneficial to\nemployees then one provided for under payment of \nGratuity Act\n.\n \nAfter considering\nthe statutory provisions and the decisions of the Supreme Court in \nSom Prakash\nRekhi Vs. Union of India\n, reported in (1981) 1 SCC 449; \nSudhir Chandra Sarkar\nVs. TATA Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.\n, reported in (1984) 3 SCC 369; \nUnion of India\nVs.

State of Maharashtra and another\n, reported in (2004) 9 SCC 43810 : (1996) 2\nSCR 353, at paragraph Nos.41 to 46 the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows;\n\n \"41.\nSection 2 (d)\n of the Act defines Controlling Authority as an authority\nappointed by the appropriate Government under \nSection 3\n of the Act. Under\n\nSection 3\n the Controlling Authority is made responsible for the administration\nof the Act and it further provides for appointment of different authorities for\ndifferent areas.\n\n 42. \nSection 7\n deals with for determination of the amount of gratuity.\nEvery person who is eligible for payment of gratuity under the Act is required\nto send a written application to the employer in the prescribed form for payment\nof such gratuity. Sub-section (2) of \nSection 7\n provides once the gratuity\nbecomes payable, the employer shall, whether an application has been made or\nnot, determine the amount of gratuity and give notice in writing to the person\nto whom the gratuity is payable and also to the Controlling Authority specifying\nthe amount of gratuity so determined and arrange to pay the amount of gratuity\nto the person to whom the gratuity is payable.\n\n 43.The Scheme envisaged under \nSection 7\n of the Act, is that in case of any\ndispute to the amount of gratuity payable to an employee under the Act or as to\nthe admissibility of any claim of, or in relation to, an employee payable to\ngratuity etc. the employer is required to deposit with the Controlling Authority\nthe admitted amount payable as gratuity. In case of any dispute parties may make\nan application to the Controlling Authority for deciding the dispute who after\ndue inquiry and after giving the parties to the dispute, a reasonable\nopportunity of being heard, determine the matter or matters in dispute and if,\nas result of such inquiry any amount is found to be payable to the employee, the\nControlling Authority shall direct the employer to pay such amount to the\nemployee.\n\n 44.Sub-section (7) of \nSection 7\n, provides for an appeal against the order\nof the Controlling Authority. \nThe Act\n, nowhere confers any jurisdiction upon the\nControlling Authority to deal with any issue under sub-section (5) of \nSection 4\n\nas to whether the terms of gratuity payable under any Award or agreement or\ncontract is more beneficial to employees than the one provided for payment of\ngratuity under the Act. This Court's order could not have conferred any such\njurisdiction upon the Controlling Authority to decide any matter under sub-\nsection (5) of \nSection 4\n, since the Parliament in its wisdom had chosen to\nconfer such jurisdiction only upon the appropriate Government and that too for\nthe purposes of considering to grant exemption from the operation of the\nprovisions of the Act.\n\n 45.Even on merits the conclusions drawn by the Controlling Authority that\nthe Pension Scheme (old) offered by the Bank is more beneficial since the amount\nof money the pensioners got under the Pension Scheme is more than the amount\nthat could have been received in the form of gratuity under the provisions of\nthe Act is unsustainable. The Controlling Authority failed to appreciate that\nsub- section (5) of \nSection 4\n of the Act, protects the right of an employee to\nreceive better terms of gratuity under any award or agreement or contract with\nthe employer than the benefits conferred under the Act. The comparison, if any,\ncould be only between the terms of gratuity under any award or agreement or\ncontract and payment of gratuity payable to an employee under \nSection 4\n of the\nAct. There can be no comparison between a Pension Scheme which does not provide\nfor payment of any gratuity and right of an employee to receive payment of\ngratuity under the provisions of the Act.\n\n 46. Viewed from any angle the order of the Controlling Authority is\nunsustainable. The order is liable to be set aside and the same is accordingly\nset aside.\"\n\n 25. \nIn an unreported common order in W.P.(MD).Nos.11896 to 11898 of 2008,\ndated 16.03.2012, (Venugopal and two others Vs. The Joint Commissioner of\nLabour, Madurai and the Management of Thanjavur Sarvodaya Sangham, Thanjavur),\nthree writ petitions have been filed by three employees of the second respondent\nManagement therein, challenging the order passed by the Joint Commissioner of\nLabour, the Appellate Authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, made in\nP.G.A.I.A.Nos.16 to 18 of 2006, by which the said authority allowed the appeals\nfiled by the second respondent management and set aside the orders passed by the\nControlling Authority viz., the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, in \nP.G.\n Case\nNos.18 to 20 of 2004. In the above cases, the Management was having its own\nscheme for voluntary retirement and according to the scheme, those who retired\nfrom service can avail the benefit of gratuity for 45 months of salary. The\nscheme was modified on 01.05.2002 in its 92nd General Body Meeting held on\n11.04.2002 and that the petitioners therein submitted their applications for\nseeking voluntary retirement and that they were relieved from service on\n30.04.2002. They contended that as per resolution No.3(2), they were entitled\nto gratuity of 45 months of salary, along with other retirement benefits, but\npaid only a limited extent. In sum and substance, the grievance of the\npetitioners therein was that full gratuity agreed to, at the general body\nmeeting was not paid. Hence, applications have been made before the controlling\nauthority, under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. The second respondent Management\ninter alia has contended that the employees applied for voluntary retirement of\nservice from 17.04.2002, 25.04.2002 & 27.04.2002, respectively and that they\nwere paid part of the gratuity amount and due to paucity of funds, the entire\namount could not be paid and that the petitioners herein agreed to receive the\nbalance, as and when the financial position of the Sangam improved.\n\n \n26.In \nthe above case\n, the Controlling Authority by its order, dated\n03.04.2006, allowed the applications, holding that the general body resolution\nmade in the 92nd meeting was fully applicable to the petitioners therein and\nthat therefore, they are entitled for 45 months salary, along with interest, as\ngratuity. Being aggrieved by the same, the Management has filed an appeal before\nthe Joint Commissioner of Labour, the appellate authority under the \nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n. Inter alia it has been contended that the Controlling Authority\nunder the \nGratuity Act\n has no jurisdiction to enforce a private scheme framed\nfor voluntary retirement. It has been further contended that, since the\npetitioners therein were already paid gratuity, the question of payment of\ninterest, on the unpaid amount does not arise. The appellate authority held\nthat the Controlling Officer has no jurisdiction to enforce any private scheme\nof gratuity and in that view of the matter, set aside the order passed by the\ncontrolling authority.\n \nWhen a challenge to the said order of the appellate\nAuthority under the payment of \nGratuity Act\n was made, in W.P.(MD).Nos.11896 to\n11898 of 2008, the Hon'ble Mr.Justice Chandru, after considering the \nGujarat\nState Export Corporation Ltd., Vs. Madhusudan L.Khandwala\n, reported in\n2004(II) LLJ 389 ; \nAyyappan Vs. Joint Commissioner\n, reported in (1999) II LLJ\n1351; \nEastern Coal Fields Ltd., Vs. Regional Labour Commissioner\n, reported in\n1982 II LLJ 324; \nGujarat State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Chandrakant\nTapubhai Vyas\n, reported in 2004 (III) LLJ 86; \nThomas Kurian Vs. Idukki\nDistrict Co-operative Bank Limited and others\n, reported in 2003 (99) FLR 154;\nand \nAllahabad Bank and another Vs. All India Allahabad Bank Retired Employees\nAssociation\n, reported in 2010 (2) SCC 44, held that no interference called for\nin the order passed by the appellate authority, wherein, the said authority has\nheld that the controlling authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n has no\njurisdiction to enforce a private scheme of gratuity.\n\n \n27.In an unreported decision made in W.A.No.675 of 2007, dated 26.10.2010,\n(\nManagement, Madurai District Central Co-operative Bank Limited, Madurai Vs.\nthe Joint Commissioner of Labour, Madurai\n and 5 others), the respondents\ntherein, were the employees of the Bank and on attaining the age of\nsuperannuation the respondents 3 to 6 therein received gratuity, according to\nthe Group Gratuity (Cash Accumulation) Scheme. Stating that they were to be\npaid gratuity, as per the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, the respondents 3 to 6 filed\napplications before the controlling authority, claiming that the further amount\nof gratuity has to be calculated, by ignoring the maximum of 20 months salary,\nprescribed in the Group Gratuity Scheme. By a common order, dated 04.03.2004,\nthe controlling authority allowed the claim of the respondents 3 to 6 and\nordered payment of gratuity, as per the Act. The appeals filed by the Bank\nbefore the Joint Commissioner of Labour, Madurai, appellate authority, were also\ndismissed. Being aggrieved by the same, the Bank has filed a W.P.(MD).No.874 of\n2006. The writ Court, while considering the dispute, held that so long as the\nterms of \nSection 12(3)\n of the settlement is in existence, it can override, only\nthe contract providing for lesser benefits, as per \nSection 14\n of the Payment of\nGratuity Act and further held that therefore, the Bank having signed the\nagreement, cannot resile from the terms of the settlement, as it deals with the\nvery same subject matter viz., gratuity and accordingly, dismissed the writ\npetitions.\n\n 28. The Bank pursued the matter by filing a Writ Appeal (MD).No.675 of\n2007 and inter alia contended that under \nSection 7(4)\n of the Payment of Gratuity\nAct, if there was any dispute, as to the amount of gratuity payable under the\nAct, it can only be decided by the controlling authority, but, when the dispute\nbetween the appellant bank and the respondent 3 to 6 pertain to gratuity\npayment, under Group Gratuity Scheme linked with Life Insurance Corporation of\nIndia, as mentioned in the settlement under \nSection 12(3)\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act, such a dispute would not come under the purview of \nSection 7(4)\n of\nthe Payment of Gratuity Act. It was therefore, contended by the bank, that both\nthe controlling and the appellate authorities, under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n\nhave no jurisdiction, to entertain such a dispute. It was also contended that\nthe controlling and appellate authorities have no jurisdiction to entertain such\na dispute. The contentions of the Bank, incorporated at paragraph Nos. 9 to 10\nof the Judgment of the Division Bench, are extracted hereunder:\n\n \"9.Under \nSection 7(4)\n of the Act, if there is any dispute as to the amount\nof gratuity payable to the employee under the Act or as to the admissibility of\nany claim or in relation to an employee for payment of gratuity, or as to the\nperson entitled to receive the gratuity, Respondents 1 and 2 who are the\ncompetent authority under the Act shall have jurisdiction. \nIn \nthe above\ndecision\n [(2004) II LLJ 389], gratuity was payable on the basis of private\nscheme and the factual matrix of the said case is entirely different from the\ncase on hand. The dispute is not mere interpretation of any provision of\nsettlement, but to see whether the employees can claim gratuity under \nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n or as per settlement. Therefore, it cannot be contended that\nRespondents 1 and 2 did not have competency to entertain the claim.\n\n 10.There is Group Gratuity (Cash Accumulation) Scheme linked with Life\nInsurance Corporation of India in the Appellant Bank. As per the scheme, an\nemployee is entitled to get 15 days wages as gratuity for every year of service,\nsubject to a maximum of the amount equivalent to 20 months salary. According to\nAppellant Bank, since the gratuity amount was more beneficial to the employees\nthan the Act, in the settlement dated 17.02.1997 under \nSection 12(3)\n of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act, it was agreed to continue the Group Gratuity Scheme, So\nthe existing practice of payment of gratuity under Group Gratuity Scheme has\nbeen continued as per the Settlement. in the subsequent \nSection 12(3)\n\nsettlement dated 05.12.2003 also it has been reiterated that the existing\nbenefit of payment of gratuity as per the Group Gratuity Scheme would continue.\"\n\n 29. Similar to the issue in the present case, as to how the salary has to\nbe computed for the purpose of arriving at the gratuity, in the unreported\njudgment in Writ Appeal No.675 of 2007, dated 26.10.2010, the salary, defined in\nClause 1 (xiv) of the Group Gratuity (Cash Accumulation) Scheme has been\nextracted as follows;\n\n \"Clause 1(xiv): \"Salary\" shall mean gross salary of the member inclusive\nof dearness allowance shall not include the commission, house rent allowance,\nbonus, overtime or any emoluments a variable or contingent nature. In the case\nof monthly rated employees a day's is to be calculated as 1/26th of the monthly\nsalary and in case of daily rated employees salary will be calculated as 26\ntimes the daily wages.\"\n\n However, the Division Bench did not go into the aspect of jurisdiction,\nbut decided the issue on merits, in favour of the bank.\n\n \n30.The decision in \nBeed District Central Co-operative Bank Vs. State of\nMaharashtra & others\n, reported in 2006(8) SCC 514, does not pertain to\njurisdiction. The decision in Executive Engineer and another Vs. M/s.Sri\nSeetaram Rice Mill, reported in 2011 (12) SCALE 243, relied on by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner, may not in strict sense, applicable to the facts of\nthis case.\n\n \n31. Let me now consider, the decisions relied on by the learned counsel\nfor the respondents which are (\na) State of Punjab Vs. Labour\n Court, Jullundur\nand others, reported in 1981 (1) LLJ 354; (\nb) Steel Authority of India Vs.\nRegional Labour Commissioner (Central) & others\n, reported in 1995 (1) LLJ 1007;\n\n 32. \nIn \nState of Punjab Vs. Labour\n Court, Jullundur and others, reported in\n1981(1) LLJ 354, the contention raised by the Government as to the jurisdiction\nof the controlling, has been answered at paragraph Nos.6 & 7, which are as\nfollows;\n\n \"6.The third contention raised by the appellant is that the employee\nrespondents were not entitled to apply under \nsection 33-C(2)\n of the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 for payment of the gratuity, and should have, if at all,\napplied under the provisions of the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. It is urged that\nthe \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n is a self-contained code incorporating all the\nessential provisions relating to payment of gratuity which can be claimed under\nthat Act, and its provisions impliedly exclude recourse to any other statute for\nthat purpose. The contention has force and must be accepted. A careful perusal\nof the relevant provisions of the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n shows that Parliament\nhas enacted a closely knit scheme providing for payment of gratuity. A\ncontrolling authority is appointed by the appropriate Government under section\n\n3. and Parliament has made him responsible for the administration of the entire\nAct. In what event gratuity will become payable and how it will be quantified\nare detailed in \nsection 4\n. \nSection 7(1)\n entitled a person eligible for payment\nof gratuity to apply in that behalf to the employer. Under \nsection 7(2)\n, the\nemployer is obliged, as soon as gratuity becomes payable and whether an\napplication has or has not been made for payment of gratuity, to determine the\namount of gratuity and inform the person to whom the gratuity is payable\nspecifying the amount of gratuity so determined. He is obliged, by virtue of the\nsame provision, to inform the controlling authority also, thus ensuring that the\ncontrolling authority is seized at all times of information in regard to\ngratuity as it becomes payable. If a dispute is raised in regard to the amount\nof gratuity payable or as to the admissibility of any claim to gratuity, or as\nto the person entitled to receive the gratuity, \nsection 7(4) (a)\n requires the\nemployer to deposit with the controlling authority such amount as he admits to\nbe payable by him as gratuity. The controlling authority is empowered. under\n\nsection 7(4)(b)\n, to enter upon an adjudication of the dispute, and after due\ninquiry, and after giving the parties to the dispute a reasonable opportunity of\nbeing heard, he is required to determine the amount of gratuity payable. In this\nregard, the controlling authority has all the powers as are vested in a court\nwhile trying a suit under \nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 in respect of\nobtaining evidentiary material and the recording of evidence. The amount\ndeposited by the employer with the controlling authority as the admitted amount\nof gratuity will be paid over by the controlling authority to the employee or\nhis nominee or heir. \nSection 7(7)\n provides an appeal against the order of the\ncontrolling authority under \nsection 7(4)\n to the appropriate Government or such\nother authority as may be specified by the appropriate Government in that\nbehalf. The appropriate Government or the appellate authority is empowered under\n\nsection 7(8)\n, after giving the parties to the appeal a reasonable opportunity of\nbeing heard, to confirm, modify or reverse the decision of the controlling\nauthority. Where the amount of gratuity payable is not paid by the employer with\nin the prescribed time, the controlling authority is required by \nsection 8\n, on\napplication made to it by the aggrieved person, to issue a certificate for that\namount to the Collector. The Collector, thereupon, is empowered to recover the\namount of gratuity, together with compound interest thereon at the rate of nine\nper cent per annum from the date of expiry of the prescribed time, as arrears of\nland revenue, and pay the same to the person entitled thereto.\n\n 7.It is apparent that the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n enacts a complete code\ncontaining detailed provisions covering all the essential features of a scheme\nfor payment of gratuity. It creates the right to payment of gratuity, indicates\nwhen the right will accrue, and lays down the principles for quantification of\nthe gratuity. It provides further for recovery of the amount, and contains an\nespecial provision that compound interest at nine per cent per annum will be\npayable on delayed payment. For the enforcement of its provisions, the Act\nprovides for the appointment of a controlling authority, who is entrusted with\nthe task of administering the Act. The fulfillment of the rights and obligations\nof the parties are made his responsibility, and he has been invested with an\namplitude of power for the full discharge of that responsibility. Any error\ncommitted by him can be corrected in appeal by the appropriate Government or an\nappellate authority particularly constituted under the Act.\"\n\n \n33.In \nthe said judgment\n, the contention was as to whether an application\nfiled under \nSection 33(c)(2)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act would lie before the\nLabour Court, when the amount under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n was not paid and\nat paragraph Nos.8 & 9 the Apex Court has held as follows;\n\n \"8.Upon all these considerations, the conclusion is inescapable that\nParliament intended that proceedings for payment of gratuity due under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n must be taken under that Act and not under any other.\nThat being so, it must be held that the applications filed by the employee\nrespondents under \nsection 33-C(2)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act did not lie,\nand the Labour Court had no jurisdiction to entertain and dispose of them. On\nthat ground, this appeal must succeed.\n\n 9.In the circumstances, it is not necessary to notice the further\nsubmission on behalf of the appellant that where a serious dispute exists in\nregard to the basis of a claim for payment of gratuity, no proceedings will lie\nunder \nSection 33C(2)\n of the Industrial Disputes Act.\"\n\n 34. \nIn \nSteel Authority of India Vs. Regional Labour Commissioner (Central)\n& others\n, reported in 1995 (1) LLJ 1007, one of the contentions raised by the\nparties was, whether the controlling authority has jurisdiction to entertain a\ndispute regarding the payment of gratuity, if there are better terms of gratuity\nunder any award or agreement or contract with the employer. Dealing with the\nissue, at para No.9, the Division Bench of the Orissa High Court held as\nfollows;\n\n \"9. The aforesaid being the gamut of operation of \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n\nwhich is a beneficial legislation, we cannot deny the opp party No. 3 his right\nto claim gratuity and get it adjudicated before the Controlling Authority for\nthe period during which his wages came to be enhanced beyond the ceiling. It\nwould be against the spirit of the Act to drive him to seek this remedy in some\nother forum. Since the entitlement of the employee- opposite party to get the\ngratuity is conceded and the only dispute by the employer being that for the\nsubsequent period, another forum should be approached, we are of the considered\nopinion that the equitable jurisdiction of this Court should not be invoked\nunder \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution. It is well settled that where an inferior\ntribunal passes a just and correct order, the High Court may not interfere with\nthe same, even if the order may be without jurisdiction. In the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case, it would be wholly unjust and inequitable to\nrequire the employee to approach another forum for part of the service period to\nreceive the gratuity.\"\n\n 35. In W.P.Nos.11896 to 11898 of 2008, dated 16.03.2012, after considering\nvarious judgments, including the judgment of the Apex Court in Allahabad Bank's\ncase, cited supra, this Court has held that the authority under the \nGratuity\nAct\n, has no jurisdiction to enforce the private scheme of gratuity. When there\nis a judgment of this Court, rendered on the basis of an Apex Court judgment, it\nis binding on the co-equal Bench and has to be followed.\n\n 36. In the light of the above, the writ petition is allowed, holding that\nthe controlling authority under the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, has no jurisdiction\nto decide the dispute and accordingly, the common order passed by the first\nrespondent, appellate authority are set aside. Consequently, connected\nM.P.(MD).No.1 of 2009 is dismissed and M.P.(MD).No.1 of 2010 is closed. No\ncosts.\n\ngcg\n\nTo\n\n1.The Assistant Commissioner of\n Labour, Sundaram Theatre Road,\n K.K.Nagar, Madurai-20.\u001a",

Stating that they were to be\npaid gratuity, as per the \nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, the respondents 3 to 6 filed\napplications before the controlling authority, claiming that the further amount\nof gratuity has to be calculated, by ignoring the maximum of 20 months salary,\nprescribed in the Group Gratuity Scheme. By a common order, dated 04.03.2004,\nthe controlling authority allowed the claim of the respondents 3 to 6 and\nordered payment of gratuity, as per the Act. The appeals filed by the Bank\nbefore the Joint Commissioner of Labour, Madurai, appellate authority, were also\ndismissed. Being aggrieved by the same, the Bank has filed a W.P.(MD).No.874 of\n2006. The writ Court, while considering the dispute, held that so long as the\nterms of \nSection 12(3)\n of the settlement is in existence, it can override, only\nthe contract providing for lesser benefits, as per \nSection 14\n of the Payment of\nGratuity Act and further held that therefore, the Bank having signed the\nagreement, cannot resile from the terms of the settlement, as it deals with the\nvery same subject matter viz., gratuity and accordingly, dismissed the writ\npetitions."
