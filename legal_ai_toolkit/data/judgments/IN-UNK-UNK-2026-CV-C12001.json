The State of Uttar Pradesh formulated a new scheme of\npension and provident fund for the employees of Aided Degree\nColleges of the State. This was made effective by\nGovernment Order (G.O.) dated August 24, 1980. This G.O.\ncame to be issued on the demand of the teachers of various\naided educational institutions including Degree Colleges for\nbetter terminal benefits like pension and death-cum-\nretirement gratuity. One of the points urged in support of\nthe claim was' that similarly situated teachers in\nGovernment Colleges were better off in this regard and there\nwas no reason to treat the other teachers differently. It\nwas urged that the two categories of teachers being\nsimilarly situated the difference was discriminatory as\nwell. It however deserves notice at the threshold itself\nthat the retirement age of aided colleges teachers was (and\nis) 60 years, whereas in Government\n\n 731\n\nColleges the retirement age is 58 years which is at par with\nthe retirement age of other Government servants.\n\n3. The G.O. made available two packages leaving it to the\nteachers concerned to opt for one of these. One option was\nto retire at the age of 60 years in which case pension as\navailable to Government Colleges teachers would be\navailable; so also general provident fund. They would not\nhowever get gratuity. Those who would opt to retire at 58\nyears would get death-cum-retirement gratuity also along\nwith aforesaid two benefits; so too family pension.\n\n4. It seems that most of the members of the U.P.\nUniversity Colleges Pensioners' Association, respondent\nhere, for short the Association, opted for first package.\nThey have however felt aggrieved at the denial of gratuity;\nso also with computation of pension by taking the last pay\ndrawn on completion of 58 years even though they continued\n(and continue) in service till completion of 60 years. The\nAssociation challenged the aforesaid G.O. on these counts\nbefore the High Court of Allahabad. Some grievance was also\nmade at the denial of commutation of pension which facility\nwas made available by G.O. dated December 19, 1988 making it\neffective from August 14, 1988. The Association desired\nmaking available of this facility even to the retirees prior\nto August 14, 1988.\n\n5. The High Court has directed the State to give the\nbenefit of pension on the last emoluments drawn at the age\nof 60 years and also to make available the benefit of\ngratuity. Another direction given is to give benefit of\ncommutation to the teachers who had retired prior to August\n14, 1988. Feeling aggrieved, the State has approached this\nCourt under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution.\n\n6. Shri Yogeshwar Prasad, learned senior standing counsel\nfor the State, contends that by no token the teachers of\naided colleges could have been placed in better situation\nthan the teachers of Government Colleges; but this is effect\nof the judgment of the High Court inasmuch as the aided\ncolleges teachers would, even while retiring age the age of\n60 years, get pension on the basis of the last pay drawn, so\nalso gratuity whereas the Government College teachers would\nretire at the completion of 58 years of age and their\npension would be calculated accordingly. Another submission\nmade in this regard is that members of the Association\nhaving opted for the first package it does not lie in their\nmouth to resile from the terms of the package. Learned\ncounsel rightly submits that one cannot blow hot and cold at\nthe same time; or approbate and reprobate simultaneously.\nThere being two packages, a third package could not have\nbeen formulated by the High Court giving best of the terms\nof the two packages. It is finally contended that insofar\nas denial of gratuity is concerned no grievance can be made\nby the Association inasmuch as aided colleges teachers whose\nage of retirement is 60 years cannot be said to be similarly\nsituated to Government teachers who retire at the age of 58\nyears. The denial cannot be said to be discriminatory\naccording to the learned counsel. As to the grant of\nbenefit of commutation to the pre-\n\n732\n\nAugust 14, 1988 retirees, the submission is that this\nfacility having been brought into existence with effect from\nAugust 14, 1988, those had retired before that could not\nhave been given the benefit, as commutation of pension can\nbe made only before one retires.\n\n7. Shri Jain appearing for the respondent-Association\ncontends that the members of the Association having been\nallowed to continue till the age of 60 years, the\ndetermination of pension on the basis of the last pay drawn\non completion of 58 years is incongruous and irrational. It\nhas also been urged that though the first package qua the\naided colleges teachers required computation of pension on\nthe basis of salary drawn at the age of 58 years, teachers\nof aided higher secondary school, even though they also\nretire at the age of 60 years, have been permitted to get\ntheir pension computed on the basis of the salary last\ndrawn. This is discriminatory urges Shri Jain. As to the\ndenial of gratuity to the first optees, the learned counsel\nsubmits that gratuity being a part of pension, as held by a\nBench of this Court in \nJarnail Singh v. Secretary, Ministry\nof Home Affairs\n' the same could not have been denied while\nmaking available liberalised pension.\n\n8. Insofar as his submission relating to the basis of\ncomputation of pension, we would observe that in principle\nwe do not find any objection in computing the pension on the\nbasis of last pay drawn at the age of 58 years. This is for\nthe reason that demand of the Association being basically\ngrounded on the better pensionary benefit available to\nGovernment teachers, the State was amply justified, while\nconsidering the question of liberalising the pension qua the\naided teachers, to peg the computation of pension with\nreference to the pay at the age of 58 years, which is the\nretirement age of Government teachers. This apart, as to\nhow much of liberalisation should have been conceded is a\nmatter of policy and if the Government decided to go as far\nas visualised by the G.O. of April 28, 1980, it is not open\nto any court to interfere with the same, as the policy\ncontained in the G.O. cannot be said to be either\nunreasonable or against public interest, which are the only\ntwo grounds available to a court to interfere with a policy\nmatter while reviewing the same judicially.\n\n9. There is, however, force in the submission of Shri Jain\nthat there exists no rational basis for treating teachers of\naided higher secondary school and teachers of aided colleges\ndifferently for the purpose of computation of pension,\ninasmuch as teachers of aided school also retire at the age\nof 60. On this point being urged by Shri Jain when the case\nwas taken up for hearing on January 21, 1994, we wanted the\nState counsel to apprise us whether the submission is\ncorrect and to file necessary rules holding the field.\n\n10. Pursuant to the order of January 21, 1994 an additional\naffidavit verified on February 4, 1994 was filed. We have\nperused this affidavit which, however, does not contain\nextract of any rule. What has instead been brought on\nrecord is a document bearing letter No. 5310/fifteen-8-\n304(2)/1974, dated March 31, 1978. This document shows that\nteachers of\n1 (1993) 1 SCC 47: 1993 SCC (L&S) 1 19: (1993) 23 ATC 642\n\n 733\n\naided higher secondary school get pension as given to the\nsame rank and class of Government school teachers and the\ncalculation is as per the procedure\" applicable to\nGovernment employees. This document has an annexure which\nspeaks about the rate of pension. Shri Yogeshwar Prasad has\ndrawn our attention to this annexure as per which after 32\nyears of service, the pension amount becomes stagnant.\n\n11. The affidavit is silent on the question whether the\npension payable to teachers of aided higher secondary school\nis being calculated on the basis of last pay drawn at the\nage of 60 years. So, we asked Shri Yogeshwar Prasad to\nstate the correct factual position. Learned counsel stated\nthat the correct position is that pension is being\ncalculated as per the last pay drawn at the age of 60 years.\nHe, however, brought to our notice the statement in the\nadditional affidavit that these teachers are not entitled to\npayment of gratuity. He, therefore, urged that members of\nthe Association cannot get benefit of both gratuity and\ncomputation of pension on the basis of last pay drawn at the\nage of 60 years.\n\n12. We do find force in the aforesaid contention of Shri\nYogeshwar Prasad. We have also noted that though the\nGovernment teachers get gratuity they retire at the\ncompletion of 58 years of age. Confronted with this\nsituation, Shri Jain submitted that if we would not be\ninclined to grant benefit of both gratuity and calculations\nof pension on the basis of the last pay drawn on attaining\nthe age of 60 years, the Association would rather forego\ngratuity and would opt for pension to be calculated as in\nthe case of teachers of higher secondary schools.\n\n13. Before we express our views on the aforesaid matter, we\nwould deal with the submission of Shri Jain that gratuity\nhas to be taken as a part of pension, to support which\ncontention our attention has been invited to this Court's\njudgment in \nJarnail Singh\n case'. Perusal of that judgment\nshows that gratuity was taken to be a part of pension\nbecause of the definition of \"pension\" as given in clause\n\n(o) of sub-rule (i) of Rule 3 of Central Civil Services\n(Pension) Rules, 1972. It is because of this definition\nthat the case of \nD. V. Kapoor v. Union of India2\n in which it\nhad been held that gratuity was not a part of pension, was\nnot followed, as the Bench which decided that case had not\nbeen referred to the aforesaid definition of pension.\n\nSimilar observation was made in Jarnail Singh case'\nregarding \nF.R. Jesuratnam v. Union of India3\n wherein also\ngratuity was not regarded as part of pension without noting\nthe abovenoted definition.\n\n14. To buttress his aforesaid submission, Shri Jain also\nrefers to clause (17) of \nArticle 366\n of the Constitution\nwhich has defined pension to include gratuity. Merely\nbecause what has been stated in clause (17) it cannot be\nheld that gratuity has to be taken always and for all\npurposes as part of pension, because this definition\napparently has enlarged the meaning of the word \"pension\" by\nstating that this would include gratuity. It is well known\n2 (1990) 4 SCC 314: 1990 SCC (L&S) 696: (1990) 14 ATC 906\n3 1990 Supp SCC 640: 1990 SCC (L&S) 370: (1991) 16 ATC 540\n\n734\n\nthat legislature very often wants to give enlarged meaning\nto a particular word and this is done by stating that the\ndefined word would include some named related subjects also.\n\n15. We, therefore, state that either because of what was\nstated in \nJamail Singh\n case' or the way \"pension\" has been\ndefined in the Constitution, it cannot be held that pension\nand gratuity are conceptually same, as stated in paragraph 9\nof \nJarnail Singh\n case' to which our attention is invited by\nShri Jain. According to us, this Court took the view in\nquestion in Jarnail Singh because of the definition of the\nword \"pension\" in the concerned rule; otherwise, what was\nheld in D. V. Kapoor2 and F.R. Jesuratnam3 cases seem to be\ncorrect legal position.\n\n16. Before concluding, we may deal with the grievance of\nthe State regarding that part of High Court's judgment by\nwhich commutation benefit was made available to those\nteachers who had retired prior to August 14, 1988. In this\ncontext, Shri Yogeshwar Prasad has rightly submitted that\nthe benefit of commutation having been made available for\nthe first time by G.O. of December 19, 1988, making it\neffective from August 14, 1988, the direction to give this\nbenefit to those who had retired before August 14, 1988 was\nerroneous and unreasonable also. This is for the simple\nreason that commutation of pension can be resorted to before\none retires and not afterwards.\n\n17. Keeping in view all the above, we dispose of the appeal\nby stating that pension of aided college teachers who had\nopted for the first package of G.O. dated August 24, 1980\nwould be determined on the basis of the last pay drawn by\nthem as on their retirement at the age of 60 years and the\ncalculation would abide what has been stated in the annexure\nto the aforesaid Government letter dated March 31, 1978; but\nthat part of the High Court's order by which the State was\ndirected to make available benefit of gratuity also to these\noptees stands annulled. This would put the teachers at hand\nat a footing which is equal to that of aided secondary\nschool teachers. That part of the High Court's order by\nwhich benefit of commutation was ordered to those teachers\nwho had retired before August 14, 1988 is also set aside.\n\n18. On the facts and circumstances of the case, we make no\norder as to costs.\n\n736",

According to us, this Court took the view in\nquestion in Jarnail Singh because of the definition of the\nword \"pension\" in the concerned rule; otherwise, what was\nheld in D. V. Kapoor2 and F.R.

Before concluding, we may deal with the grievance of\nthe State regarding that part of High Court's judgment by\nwhich commutation benefit was made available to those\nteachers who had retired prior to August 14, 1988. In this\ncontext, Shri Yogeshwar Prasad has rightly submitted that\nthe benefit of commutation having been made available for\nthe first time by G.O. of December 19, 1988, making it\neffective from August 14, 1988, the direction to give this\nbenefit to those who had retired before August 14, 1988 was\nerroneous and unreasonable also. This is for the simple\nreason that commutation of pension can be resorted to before\none retires and not afterwards."

This would put the teachers at hand\nat a footing which is equal to that of aided secondary\nschool teachers. That part of the High Court's order by\nwhich benefit of commutation was ordered to those teachers\nwho had retired before August 14, 1988 is also set aside."
