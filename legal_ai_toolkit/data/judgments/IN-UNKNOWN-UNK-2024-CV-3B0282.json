I direct them to pay the penalty forthwith.‖\n\n2.1 Appellant is a partnership firm engaged in mobilizing\ndeposits from the public under various deposit schemes of M/s\nSahara India Financial Corporation Limited (SIFCL). With effect\nfrom 01.011.2005 SIFCL also became a partner in the\npartnership firm of appellant.\n\n2.2 Appellant entered in MOU with the SIFCL dated\n01.04.2001, 20.09.2003 and 23.05.2006. As per the MOU\nappellant was required to undertake following activities:\n\no To conduct, promote, introduce and secure business on\nbehalf of SIFCL under various schemes floated by SIFCL;\no To collect requisite amount from participating members of\nthese schemes and remit it to SIFCL.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\no To issue receipts to the members in the name of SIFCL\nonly.\no To arrange the payments of maturity/ pre maturity/\nsecured loan to the depositors against the deposits made\nby them under the various schemes, on behalf of SIFCL.\n\nAs per MOU in lieu of above SIFCL will pay to the appellant an\namount towards expenses incurred in running of its offices for\nadministering these schemes. The amount paid will be\ndetermined in following manner:\n\no 5%/ 6% of the opening balance of the audited aggregate\ndeposit liability under various schemes on account of daily\ndeposit and recurring deposit as on 1st April of each\nfinancial year;\no 0.25%/ 2% of the opening balance of the audited\naggregate deposit liability under various schemes on\naccount of fixed deposits as on 1st April of each financial\nyear;\no Provided that the total consideration as computed above\nshall not exceed 3.75% of the aggregate deposit liability as\non 1st April of each financial year.\n\n2.3 Acting on the intelligence that the appellant were evading\nthe payment of service tax under the category of Business\nAuxiliary Services, DGCEI initiated investigations against the\nappellant. The investigation culminated into Show Cause Notice\ndated whereby appellants were asked to show cause as to why:\n\ni) Service tax amounting to Rs 87,76,30,381/- (Rupees\nEighty Seven Crore Seventy Six Lakh Thirty Thousand\nThree Hundred and Eighty One only) and Education\nCess amounting to Rs 1,23,76,789/- (Rupee One Crore\nTwenty Three Lakh Seventy Six Thousand Seven\nHundred and Eighty Nine only) not paid by the should\nnot be demanded and recovered from them in terms of\nSub\nsection 1(a)\n/ proviso to sub-\nsection 1\nof\nsection 73\n\nof the Finance Act, 1994.

Aggrieved appellants\nhave filed this appeal.\n\n3.1 We have heard Shri B. L. Narasimhan and Shri Prakhar\nShukla, Advocates for the appellant and Shri Deepak Kumar\nSpecial Counsel for the revenue.\n\n3.2 Arguing for the appellant learned counsel submits that:\n\n⮚ Show cause notice and impugned order has classified the\nactivities undertaken by them as business auxiliary service\nunder sub-clause (ii) and (iv) of\nSection 65 (19)\nfor the\nperiod prior to 10.09.2004 and under sub clause (ii), (vi)\nand (vii) of\nSection 65 (19)\nfor the period post to\n10.09.2004. Same activity could not have been classified\nunder multiple categories during the same period and\nduring the different periods as has been held in following\ndecisions\no ESS GEE Real Estate Developers Pvt Ltd [2020 (34)\nGSTL 486 (T-Del)] affirmed by Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt as reported at [2020 (34) GSTL J 93 (SC)]\no CERSAI [2023 (4) TMI 435 (CESTAT-Delhi)]\no Incredible Unique Buildcon Pvt Ltd. [2022 (65) GSTL\n377 (T-Del)]\n⮚ For the period post 10.09.2004, classification has been\nmade under (vi) while holding it to be classifiable under (ii)\nfor the period prior. Both the clause are mutually\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nexclusive. In fact all the seven clauses of\nSection 65 (19)\n\nare mutually exclusive.\n⮚ Clause (iv) of\nSection 65 (19)\nas it stood before\n10.09.2004 and clause (vii) after 10.09.2004, relating to\nincidental and auxiliary activities are not stand alone\nactivities and unless those are rendered in relation to the\nother activities mentioned in the previous clauses as has\nbeen held in following decisions:\no Atlas Documentary Facilitators Co Pvt Ltd. [2017\n(50) STR 22 (T-Mum)\no Federal bank Ltd. [2008 (10) STR 320 (T-Bang)]\n⮚ Sub clause (i) of\nSection 65 (19)\nhas been impliedly given\nup by the ld Commissioner, while holding that the activity\nof accepting deposits is rendering of service and hence\ncovered by sub clause (ii). Reliance placed on the circular\ndated 05.11.2003 is incorrect as this circular has been\nquashed by Hon‟ble Andhra Pradesh High Court in Karvy\nSecurities Ltd. [2006 (2) STR 481 (AP)]\n⮚ Services rendered by the appellant to SIFCL can be\nclassified under any of sub clauses of\nSection 65 (19)\nonly\nif the activity of accepting the deposits from the customers\ncan be treated as service in as much as all the relevant\nsub clause refer to ‗service provided by the client'.\nCommissioner has held that SIFCL is in business of\naccepting deposits and since the same is not goods, that\namount to service. This is contrary to the decision in case\nof Jetlite [2011 921) STR 119 (T-Del)], Steria India Ltd.\n[2017-TIOL-3837-CESTAT-ALL];\n⮚ Accepting deposits from the customers cannot be\nconsidered as „service‟ since the most important element\nof service, i.e., consideration is absent as much as\ncontractually there is no consideration either paid or\npayable by the customer.\n⮚ After introduction of Support Services of Business or\nCommerce under\nSection 65 (104c)\nof the Act from\n01.05.2006 for the same very activity appellant has taken\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nregistration under this category, and hence no tax can be\ndemanded under any other category for the previous\nperiod. Reliance is placed on the following decisions:\no Indian national Shipowners‟ Association [2009 (14)\nSTR 289 (Bom)]\no CBRE South Asia Pvt Ltd [2020-TIOL-197-CESTAT-\nDel] affirmed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court as reported\nat [2021-TIOL-06-SC-ST-LB]\no Malviya national Institute of Technology [2019 (6)\nTMI 127-CESTAT NEW DELHI]\no Sourav Ganguly [2020-TIOL-1687-CESTAT-KOL]\no Global Coal & Mining Pvt Ltd. [2020 (36) GSTL 77 (T-\nDelhi)]\no Capital transport Convoy Contractors [2016 (2) TMI\n546 CESTAT NEW DELHI]\n⮚ Extended period of limitation is not invokable since the\nappellant was under bonafide belief that the activities\nperformed by them are not taxable under the category of\nbusiness auxiliary services.\n⮚ For the same reason the penalty is also not imposable.\n⮚ They are entitled to claim deduction of the reimbursable\nexpenses from the gross amount charged in view of the\ndecisions as follows:\no Intercontinental Consultants and Technocrats Pvt\nLtd. [2012-TIOL-966-HC-DEL-ST] affirmed by the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court at [2018 (10) GSTL 401\n(SC)]\n\n3.3 Arguing for the revenue learned special counsel submits\nthat-\n\n⮚ Appellant activities are covered under the taxable category\nof Business Auxiliary Service under clause (ii) and (iv) ibid\nfor the period 01.07.2003 to 09.09.2004.\n⮚ The word service used in (ii) is service and not taxable\nservice. This clause will be applicable if the service is\nprovided by the appellant to service recipient, even if the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nservice provided by the recipient does not fall within the\ncategory of taxable service. It is a settled principle in law\nthat the taxing statute should be interpreted literally.\nReliance is placed on the following decisions;\no Reliance Industries [2017 (6) GSTL 113 (SC)]\no ALD Automotive [2018 (364) ELT 3 (SC)]\no Doypack System Pvt Ltd [1988 (36) ELT 201 (SC)]\no Hemraj Govardhan Das [1978 (2) ELT J 350 (SC)]\no Bhalla Enterprise [2004 (173) ELT 225 (SC)]\n⮚ The contention of the appellant that for service to fall\nunder promotion or marketing of service provided by\nclient, the service recipient must be service provider for\nsome service, is correct but their conclusion that the\nservice provided by the service recipient should be\ndifferent than the service provided to them by the\nappellant is erroneous.\n⮚ The client of the appellant is engaged in the service of\nencouraging saving habits among the public & to accept\ndeposits as per directive of RBI whereas the appellant is\nengaged in providing services to SIFCL by promoting or\nmarketing the service provided by their client SIFCL. Thus\nadjudicating authority has rightly concluded that the\nservices of the appellant are covered by clause (ii) & (iv)\nunder BAS for the period 01.07.2003 to 09.09.2004.\n⮚ The appellant‟s activities are covered under the clause (vi)\nof\nSection 65 (19)\nibid for the period 10.09.2004 to\n31.07.2006.\n⮚ Appellants have contended that the (ii) of\nSection 65 (19)\n\ncontinued as such even after introduction of (vi) in the said\nsection with effect from 10.09.2004. Their contention\nrelying on certain case laws to effect that, if the activity\nwas covered under the (ii) then how can the same be\nclassified again under (vi) is without any substance.\nNormally this would not happen, but when a more specific\nentry is introduced for defining the same service rendered\nthen the classification has to be done as per the specific\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nentry.\nSection 65 A\nof the Finance Act, 1994 provided for\nthe application of this principle for classifying the services\nwhich are classifiable under more than one entries. The\ndecisions referred to by the learned counsel are\ndistinguishable. Thus it is possible that the same activity of\nthe appellant is classifiable with reference to (ii) of\nSection\n65 (19)\nup to 9.10.2004 and with reference to (iv)\nthereafter.\n⮚ The contention of the appellant that (vi) is applicable only\nif SIFCL is rendering any taxable service to its clients\nnamely depositors as it is not the case that accepting of\ndeposit is in the nature of taxable service. It has been\nstated earlier also that the phrase used in\nsection 65 (19)\n(vi)\nis service and not taxable service. Thus this contention\nis not tenable.\n⮚ Further the contention that SIFCL is not their client and\nhence (vi) will not be applicable is also not tenable.\nExistence of client (service receiver), service provider and\npayment of service charge are 3 parameters for levy of\nservice tax. The contention of the appellant that SIFCL is\nnot their client is based on the ground that they do not\nrender any professional service to them. Black Law\nDictionary defines client and the appellants have been\nengaged by SIFCL for supporting the professional line of\nwork relating to acceptance deposits under various\nschemes and loans floated by the SIFCL, which in absence\nof appellant would have been carried out by the SIFCL.\nThis implies that SIFCL is a client, when all three\nparameters referred above are satisfied.\n⮚ MOU provided that appellant was required to work as an\nagent of SIFCL; to secure business on behalf of SIFCL, to\nissue receipt to the depositors in the name of SIFCL, to\nissue receipt to the depositors in the name of SIFCL and to\nrender services to SIFCL through its various office. Thus\nappellants were providing all the services on behalf of\nSIFCL and were receiving consideration for the same.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nHence they have provided service on behalf of their client.\nThus the contention that the post 10.09.2004 their\nservices cannot be classified as provision of service on\nbehalf of client is not correct.\n⮚ Appellant had never earlier raised the contention that their\nactivities were correctly classifiable as \"Business Support\nServices\" either before the adjudicating authority or in the\nappeal memo and has raised this contention for the first\ntime during hearing. The raising of this plea at the time of\nfinal arguments is contrary to settled law on the subject as\nper decisions in case of:\no Modern Industries Ltd. Vs Oriental Insurance Co Ltd.\n[2000 (2) SCC 734]\no DLF Ltd. [2014 (302) ELT 303 (T-Ahmd)].\n⮚ Further in terms of the clarification dated 28.02.2006 [F\nNo 33/4/2006-TRU)] the services rendered by the\nappellant were correctly classifiable as BAS\n⮚ In the same clarification it has been stated ―For the sake of\nclarity and ease of classification, certain categories of\nservices are clubbed together, and a new service category\ncreated. Some of the newly specified services may also\ncontain services which are presently covered under some\nof existing services. The scope and coverage of individual\nservice should be interpreted strictly in accordance with\nthe statutory provisions. This aspect needs to be kept in\nmind while classifying the taxable services.‖ In view of the\nabove clarification also the contention made by the\nappellant that services provided by them are correctly\nclassifiable under BSS is not correct, particularly when the\nsaid services are taxable under the category of BAS.\n⮚ Appellants have not indicated any basis of claiming the\nclassification under the category of BSS. At Sr No 11 on\npage 363 of the paper book appellant has themselves\ndeclared the ―Nature of Service: The firm is engaged in\nservices to provide office space along with infrastructural\nfacilities like telephone security etc., from its branches in\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nIndia which is taxable under Business Support Service.\nTherefore, we are liable to pay Service Tax under the said\ncategory with effect from 1.05.2006.‖ From this it is seen\nthat appellant has taken registration under this category in\nrespect of services which are not in dispute in the present\nproceedings. Just for the reason that the appellant had\nobtained registration under the category of BSS will not\nexclude the applicability of the BAS in respect of activities\nundertaken prior to it.\n⮚ Appellants claim for reimbursable expenses has not been\ndenied by the adjudicating authority, it has been\ndisallowed for the reason that the appellants were not able\nto produce clinching evidence in this regard. The claim\nmade can be allowed subject to production of such\nevidences before the original authority.\n⮚ Appellants have not adduced any evidence about the basis\non which they entertained bonafide belief that their\nactivities were not taxable as BAS, hence the invocation of\nextended period to demand this tax for period 2003 to\n2006 by invoking extended period of limitation can be\nfaulted with.\n⮚ Adjudicating authority has in her order recorded that\nconditions prescribed under Sub Rule 7 (4) have not been\nfulfilled as the appellant has neither obtained registration\nnor submitted the relevant documents as specified under\nRule 4 and 9. Their contention that the exercise is revenue\nneutral does not serve any purpose as taking CENVAT\nCredit, statutory provision of said rules has to be fulfilled\nby them.\n⮚ The appeal has no merits.\n\n4.1 We have considered the impugned order along with the\nsubmissions made in appeal, during the course of arguments and\nin the written submissions filed by both the sides.\n\n4.2\nSection 65 (19)\nof the Finance Act, 1994 as amended from\ntime to time during the period of dispute as relevant for these\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nproceedings is reproduced below:\nPeriod up to 09.10.2004\n\n(19) ―business auxiliary service‖ means any service in relation\nto,-\n\n(i) promotion or marketing or sale of goods produced or\nprovided by or belonging to the client; or\n(ii) promotion or marketing of service provided by the\nclient; or\n(iii) any customer care service provided on behalf of the\nclient; or\n(iv) any incidental or auxiliary support services such as\nbilling, collection or recovery of cheques, accounts\nand remittance, evaluation of prospective customer\nor public relation services,\n\nand includes services as commission agent, but does not\ninclude any information technology service.\n\nPost 09.10.2004\n\n(19) ―business auxiliary service‖ means any service in relation\nto,-\n\n(i) promotion or marketing or sale of goods produced or\nprovided by or belonging to the client; or\n(ii) promotion or marketing of service provided by the\nclient; or\n(iii) any customer care service provided on behalf of the\nclient; or\n(iv) procurement of goods or services, which are inputs\nfor the client; or\n(v) production of goods on behalf of the client; or\n(vi) provision of services on behalf of the client; or\n(vii) any service incidental or auxiliary to any activity\nspecified in sub-clauses (i) to (vi), such as billing,\ncollection or recovery of cheques, payments,\nmaintenance of accounts and remittance, inventory\nmanagement, evaluation or development of\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nprospective customer or vendor, public relation\nservices, management or supervision,\n\nand includes services as commission agent, but does not\ninclude any information technology service and any activity\nthat amounts to ―manufacture‖ within the meaning of clause\n(f) of section (2) of the\nCentral Excise Act, 1944\n(1 of 1944)\n\n4.3 From the definition of Business Auxiliary Service as per\n\nSection 65 (19)\nreproduced as above it is quite evident that for\nthe period up to 09.10.2004, the clause (ii) was with reference\nto promotion and marketing of services provided by the client\nand clause (iv) was with reference to the incidental or auxiliary\nsupport services provided to the client. The clause (i), (ii), (iii) &\n(iv) were mutually exclusive and referred to different categories\nof activity which need not necessarily be in relation to the\ntaxable service provided by the client. Counsel has argued that\nthe client of appellant is in business of accepting deposits, which\nper-se is not a service hence the clause (ii) and (iv) of\nsection 65\n(19)\nwould not be applicable to them, and their services cannot\nbe taxed under this category. On the contrary Commissioner has\nin the impugned order applied this clause to hold that the\nservices provided by appellant to fall under the category of\n\"business auxiliary services by application of these two clauses.\nTo understand the exact purport of the word „service‟ used in\nthis clause we need have no option but to refer to the general\nunderstanding of the word service as the same has not been\ndefined in the\nFinance Act,1994\n.\n\n4.4 Commissioner has in impugned order observed as follows:\n\n―16 The demand of service tax as per the notice issued\nby DGCEI, New Delhi on the noticee is primarily on the\nbasis of partnership deed and MOU's consisting of\ncovenant of agreement between the Noticee and SIFCL.\nThe essence of the MOUs therefore has to be critically\nexamined. The salient features of the MOUs are\nrecapitulated below;-\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n16.1 M/s SIFCL is a residuary Non Banking Companies\nand makes investment as per directive issued by RBI from\ntime to time. The deposits received by M/s SFICL is\nrequired to be invested as per directions given by RBI. M/s\nSIFCL had been incorporated with a view to carry on as\nprincipal business of encouraging saving habits among\npublic and to accept deposits in accordance with the\ndirectives issued by Reserve Bank of India for a Residuary\nNo Banking Companies and shall not carry on the business\nas banned under\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n, and Prize\nChits and Money Collection Scheme (Banking) Act, 1978.\n\n16.2 The noticee was continuing facilitating successful\nlaunching/ running of the saving schemes floated by M/s\nSIFCL by utilizing its large and well organized\ninfrastructure as per the MOUs and above MOU were duly\napproved by Central Government under\nSection 297\nof the\nCompanies Act, 1956, as per the approval letter received\nfrom the office of the Regional Director 9NR) department\nof Company Affairs Govt. of India.\n\n16.3 The Noticee has already built up well equipped\ninfrastructure facilities, having more than 1500 offices\nwith, the required manpower at various places and in\ndifferent parts of country. The staff & officers of the\nnoticee have sufficient professional expertise for running\nbusiness of savings & finance, as they have been doing it\nsince last many years & whereas the noticee is also able to\nprovide field staff & field force like Agents, Field Officers\netc., which are necessary & required for carrying on &\nconducting business as Residuary Non Banking Financial\nInstitution.\n\n16.4 As per the agreement with SIFCL, the noticee\ncontinued to act as an agent for receipt of fixed deposits\nand render the service mentioned in the agreement. With\nall service conditions and facilities readily available with\nthe noticee, M/s SIFCL has contacted the Noticee to\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\ncontinue its cooperation with M/s SIFCL to enable them to\ncontinue its relationship to promote and manage its\nbusiness of para banking and the Noticee has agreed to\ncontinue its business co-operation with M/s SIFCL and to\ncontinue to act as Agent to M/s SIFCL for its para banking\nrelated business activities which have been discussed\namongst parties and have been mutually agreed among\nthemselves.\n\nThe Agreements covenant as under:\n\n16.4.1 The noticee shall continue to work as Agent to\nSahara India Financial Corporation Limited to conduct,\npromote, introduce and secure business on behalf of M/s\nSIFCL under all its scheme which may be changed, varied,\nsuspended and modified from time to time as per the\ninstructions of M/s SIFCL.\n\n16.4.2 The noticee shall collect the requisite amount\nfrom the participating members of saving schemes and\nshall remit it to M/s SIFCL the amount so collected through\nits branches along with the statements of accounts.\nFurther the receipt shall be issued to the members in the\nname of M/s SIFCL.

An amount\ncomputed, as per the following manner, of the opening\nbalance of audited aggregate deposit liability of M/s SIFCL\nas on 1st April of every financial year shall be paid to the\nnoticee by Sahara India Financial Corporation Limited in\nthe following manner:\n\na) 5% of the opening balance of audited aggregate\ndeposit liability under various scheme on account of\ndaily deposit and recurring deposit of M/s Sahara\nIndia Financial Corporation Limited as on 1st April of\neach financial year; and\nb) 0.25% of the opening balance of audited aggregate\ndeposit liability under various scheme on account of\nfixed deposit of Sahara India Financial Corporation\nLimited as on 1st April of each financial year.\n\nProvided that the total consideration as referred to above\nin sub-clause a) and b) shall not exceed 3.75% of the\naggregate deposit liability as on 1st April of each financial\nyear as outstanding in the books of M/.s SIFCL.

Another Memorandum of Understanding effective\nfrom 01.04.2006 was entered between the noticee and M/s\nSIFCL was submitted which was also scrutinized, differs\nfrom the earlier agreement in as much as the Noticee shall\nact as an agent to m/s SIFCL and shall collect deposits\nfrom public through different scheme framed by M/s SIFCL\nand tender money so collected immediately of M/s SIFCL\nthe consideration agreed by the parties to this MOU which\nthe SIFCL would pay against the services of M/s Sahara\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nIndia equivalent to 6% of the deposit collections during the\nperiod from 01.04.2006 to 30.09.2006 under its daily and\nrecurring deposit schemes and 2% of deposit collections\nduring the period from 01.04.2006 to 30.09.2006 under its\nfixed deposit schemes for performance of functions as an\nAgent.\n\n18. In view of the above following issues emerge for\ndetermination in these adjudication proceedings:-\n\n18.1 whether during the relevant period there is provision\nof ‗taxable service' in the nature of ―Business Auxiliary\nServices‖ as provided by the Noticee to M/s SIFCL and\nwhether Noticee is liable to pay Service Tax on the same:\n\n18.2 Whether, the value of ―Business Auxiliary Services‖\nhas escaped assessment and suppression of material facts\nwith intent to evade payment of Service Tax, the extended\nperiod of demand for relevant period under\nSection 73\nof\nFA'94 was invokable.\n\n18.3 Whether the payout/ commission received by the\nnoticee was cum service tax for the period of demand\nshow cause notice.\n\n18.4 Whether the CENVAT Credit on the input service was\nadmissible to the Noticee during the period of demand.\n\n18.5 Whether the Noticee is liable to penalty under\n\nSection 76\n,\n&\nof the FA'94 for violation of different\nprovisions of the FA'94.‖\n\n....\n\n20.3 The Noticee's further main contention is that M/s\nSIFCL is not engaged in the providing any service or sale\nof goods. The deposit accepted by them is required to be\ninvested as per the direction of RBI. The deposits are\nactionable claim and money which are an actionable claim\nand money which are not goods as per definition of goods\ngiven in sales of\nGoods Act, 1930\n. It is submitted that M/s\nSIFCL does not deal in goods and also do not provide any\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nservices. Yet, the fact remain that they have appointed the\nnoticee for collection of deposit and other related works as\nmentioned in the agreement. The Noticee has submitted\nthat they are providing services in relation to the\nactionable claim and money which are not goods as per\nthe definition of goods given in the\nSales of Good Act,\n. Due to this fact i.e. goods are not covered under the\npurview of service tax, the Noticee has not provided any\nservices under the category of BAS.\n\nI this regard, it is relevant to mention a circular issued by\nthe Board dt 05.11.03. which is as under:\n\n―Circular No. 66/15/2003-ST Nov 5, 2003 (F No\n249/4/2003-CX.4) Applicability of service tax on\ncommission income earned on distribution and marketing\nof units of mutual fund.\n\nI am directed to say that some doubts have been raised\nregarding application of service tax on the activity of\nMutual Fund Distribution as to whether\n\n1) the commission received by distributors on mutual fund\ndistribution as liable to Service Tax under the category of\nBusiness Auxiliary Services?\n\n2) the services provided is exempt from service tax in\nterms of Notification No. 13/2003 dated 20.6.2003?\n\nIn this connection, it is clarified that the services provided\nas referred above are primarily in nature of the services of\ncommission agent in relation to clause (ii) and (iv) of the\ncategory of services mentioned in the definition of\nBusiness Auxiliary Services and hence should be leviable to\nservice tax under this category. This activity does not get\ncovered under exemption Notification No 13/20003-ST dt\n20.6.2003 as this is not in relation to sale or purchase of\ngoods. The exemption provided under Notification\n13/2003-ST is applicable only for commission agents\ndealing in goods.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nOn perusal of the circular, it is seen that the provision of\nservice by the noticee to SIFCL is similar in nature to the\nactivities undertaken by the noticee and the commission/\nconsideration received by them as agent from the principal\n(SIFCL) is liable to the service tax under BAS on the logic\nexplained in this circular.‖\n\n4.5 The relevant clauses of Memorandum of Association of\nSIFCL are reproduced below, which show the entire gamut of\nbusinesses of M/s SIFCL:\n\n―(A) The main objects to be pursued by the company on\nits incorporation is:\n\n1.

From the above Memorandum of Association\nit is quite evident that \"accepting deposit\" is only one of the\nlimbs of the entire gamut of business activities undertaken by\nthe appellant. It may prima facie appear to be without any\nconsideration as has been submitted by the appellant. It is the\nsubmission of the appellant that the act of accepting the deposits\nis without any \"consideration\" and hence cannot be termed as\n\"service\". M/s SIFCL accepts the deposits made by the\ndepositors in various schemes launched by them. They use the\ndeposits to fund their activities in business during the period\namounts are held by them. The depositors in turn allow/ permit\nM/s SIFCL to utilize their deposits for the purpose of business\nactivities of the M/s SIFCL. The permission for use of the\ndeposits by the depositors to the M/s SIFCL for their business\nactivities is a consideration for accepting the deposits made by\nthe depositor. The word \"consideration\" has a much wider\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nconnotation than the money consideration.\nSection 2(d)\nof The\nIndian Contract Act, 1872, defines the word consideration. We\nreproduce the relevant provisions of the said section below:\n\n―2. Interpretation-clause.--In this Act the following words\nand expressions are used in the following senses, unless a\ncontrary intention appears from the context:--\n\n(a) When one person signifies to another his willingness to\ndo or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to\nobtaining the assent of that other to such act or\nabstinence, he is said to make a proposal;\n\n(b) When the person to whom the proposal is made\nsignifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be\naccepted. A proposal, when accepted, becomes a promise;\n\n(c) The person making the proposal is called the\n―promisor‖, and the person accepting the proposal is called\nthe ―promisee‖;\n\n(d) When, at the desire of the promisor, the promisee or\nany other person has done or abstained from doing, or\ndoes or abstains from doing, or promises to do or to\nabstain from doing, something, such act or abstinence or\npromise is called a consideration for the promise;\n\n(e) Every promise and every set of promises, forming the\nconsideration for each other, is an agreement;\n\nConsideration is a promise to have done or have abstained\nfrom doing something, or do something or abstain from\ndoing it or do something or abstain from doing it in the\nfuture, which is decided on the desire of the promisor to\nthe contract. The word consideration has been explained\nby various authors in following manner:\n\nBlackstone: Consideration is the recompense given by the\nparty contracting to the other.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nPollock: Consideration is the price for which the promise of\nthe other is brought, and the promise thus given for value\nis enforceable.\n\nPatterson: Consideration means something, which is of\nsome value in the eye of the law. It may be some benefit\nto the plaintiff or some detriment to the defendant.\n\nCheshire and Fifoot: The expression consideration has to\nbe understood as a price paid for a promise has been\ncommended.\n\nLush J: Lush J in Curie V. Misa (1875) LR10 Ex 153 in this\ncase it was held, that consideration is ―some right,\ninterest, profit or benefit accruing to one party or\nforbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility given,\nsuffered or undertaken by the other‖.\n\n4.7 Having recorded the meaning of \"consideration\" as above\nwe also place on record the fact that in respect of business and\ncommerce, every act is for gain and there is no place for free\nlunches in the scheme of Business and Commerce. There ain't no\nsuch thing as a free lunch (TANSTAAFL) is a phrase that\ndescribes the cost of decision-making and consumption. In\neconomics, TANSTAAFL describes the concept of opportunity\ncosts, which states that for every choice made, there is an\nalternative not chosen which would also have produced some\nutility. Decision-making requires trade-offs and assumes that\nthere are no real free offerings. In the case of Curie Vs Misa\nreferred above this principle has been applied. The consideration\nas such can be in form monetary transaction or otherwise.\n\n4.8 Hon‟ble Supreme Court has in case of Indian Bank Ltd.\n\n[1965 AIR 1473 SC] held as follows:\n\nTherefore, it seems to us that there is nothing in the\nlanguage of\nS. 10\nfrom which it can be fairly implied that\nan expenditure or allowance falling within the section must\nfulfill some other condition before it can be allowed.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nA similar question arose in England in Hughes v. Bank of\nNew Zealand(21 T.C 472), and all the Judges took the view\nthat interest paid by the Bank on capital borrowed in the\ncourse of its business and utilised in buying tax-free\nsecurities had to be deducted in arriving at the taxable\nprofits of the business notwithstanding that the interest\nearned by the Bank on the tax-free securities could not be\ntaxed.\n\nLord Thankerton put the reason shortly thus \"It is perhaps\nenough to say that the Crown are unable to point to any\nstatutory provision in support of their contention, whereas\nthe Respondents find full justification for their resistance in\nthe provisions of Rule 3 of the rules applicable to cases I\nand II of Schedule D\".\n\nThis rule is similar to\ns. 10(2) (xv)\nof the Indian Income\nTax Act. After setting out the rule and noticing its effect he\nsays \"It seems to me to be incontrovertible that, in the\npresent case, the investments in question were part of the\nbusiness of the Respondents' trade, and that the expense\nconnected with them was wholly and exclusively laid out\nfor the purposes of the trade.\n\nExpenditure, in course of the trade which is un-\nremunerative is none the less a proper deduction, if wholly\nand exclusively made for the purposes of the trade. It does\nnot require the presence of a receipt on the credit side to\njustify the deduction of an expense.\"\n\nAlthough the Master of Rolls found force in the argument\nof the Crown, he could find nothing in the language of the\n\nEnglish Act\nto eliminate a part of the expenses of an\nindivisible trade. Similarly, Greene L.J., could find no\nwarrant in the language of the Statute to give effect to the\ncontention of the Crown. He observed that \"when the\nStatute says that interest is to be exempt, I am quite\nunable to read it as meaning that in giving effect to that\nexemption by implication, some repercussion is to take\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nplace on a different provision of the Act altogether....... I\ncan find nothing in the Statute which requires this interest\nto be treated, so to speak, as a trade within a trade. This\nis really what the Crown contend that in some way this\ninterest which is to be brought into account as an item of\nreceipt is to be taken out of it with some (1) 21 T C 472\napportioned expenses appropriated to it as though it were\na trade by itself.\"\n\nMr. Sastri urges that the authority of the above decision\nhas been shaken in Mitchell and Edon (H. M. Inspectors of\nTaxes) v. Ross (40 T.C. II), but we are unable to accept\nthis contention. The, point ,urged in this case was that the\nauthority of Fry v. Salisbury House Estate ([1930] A.C.\n\n432) had been qualified by the decision in Hughes v. Bank\nof New Zealand(21 T.C. 472), but this was negatived.\n\nA number of Indian cases have been cited before us and\nwe will now proceed to examine them.\n\nThe Madras High Court's decision in\nCommissioner of\nIncome 'Tax v. Somasundaran Chettiar (A.I.R.\n1928 Mad.\n\n487) does not assist Mr. sastri. The carried on business at\nMadras, where his head office was, and Ipoh, a place in\nthe Federated Malay. Money was borrowed ,at Madras and\npart of it sent to Ipoh where it was used as capital in the\nconduct of Ipoh business. The High Court held that interest\n,on the part of the borrowed money used at lpoh was\nrightly disallowed as a deduction because the business\nwhich was being taxed was the business at Madras and not\nthe business at Ipoh. No exception can be taken to the\ndecision but it does not advance the appellant's case\nbecause we are concerned with one indivisible business.\n\nIn\nProvident Investment Co. Ltd. v. C.I.T. Bombay\n(6 I.T.C.\n\n21), the assessee, an Indian Finance Company, borrowed\nsome money in India and purchased sterling securities out\nof it and retained them in India. The Bombay High Court\nheld that interest on the borrowed money could not be\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\ndeducted because \"qua the capital which it (the company)\nis using outside British India and retaining for that length\nof time outside British India, is not carrying on business in\nrespect of which profits assessable to Indian Income, tax\ncan be earned so that allowance can be claimed for\ninterest on capital borrowed within the meaning of\nS.\n10(2) (iii)\n. It :appears to us that the Bombay High Court\ndivided the business in two separate businesses. But the\nbusiness of the present assessee cannot be divided into\ntwo separate businesses. It is one and indivisible.\n\nIn\nChellappa Chettiar v. Commissioner of Income Tax\nMadras\n((1937) 5 I.T.R. 97), the assessee carrying on\nbusiness as a moneylender had borrowed money and lent\nit out to constituents. He was obliged to receive\nagricultural lands in repayment of his debts from such\nconstituents. The question arose whether he was entitled\nto a deduction in respect of the interest paid by him on\ncapital represented by the agricultural lands.\nThe Court,\nfollowing Hughes v. Bank of New Zealand (21 T.C 472)\nheld that he was entitled notwithstanding that agricultural\nincome was not taxable under the\nIncome Tax Act\n. Mr.\nSastri says that this was wrongly and was in fact dissented\nfrom by the Rangoon High Court in C.I.T. Burma v.\nN.S.A.R. Concern ((1938) 6 I.T.R. 194.). Dunkley J., in the\nRangoon case, distinguished Hughes v. Bank of New\nZealand(21 T.C 472) because he thought that the scheme\nof the Burma Income Tax Act was entirely different from\nthe scheme of the English Income Tax Act, 1918. He\nobserved that \"in England a person is assessed to income\ntax in respect of his income, while under the Burma Act it\nis the income which is taxed.\nUnder the English Act\nno\nclass of income is outside the scope of the Act whereas by\ns. 4(3) of the Burma Act the Act is made inapplicable to a\nnumber of classes of income.\nThe English Act\nmerely\nconfers certain exemptions on a person in respect of his\nincome up to a certain amount or certain kinds, similar to\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nthe exemptions conferred on certain classes of income by\nthe provisos to Secs. 8 and 9 of the Burma Act.\" Then he\nnoted the difference between the wording of s. 10 (2) (ix)\nof the Burma Act and the corresponding clause in the\n\nEnglish Act\n. But we are unable to appreciate that these\ndifferences necessitate the rejection of the principle laid\ndown in Hughes v. The Bank of New Zealand (21 T.C 472).\nIt is true that under the\nIndian Income Tax Act\nit is income\nthat is taxed but it is not taxed in vacuo. It is taxed in the\nhands of a person. In England, the interest of tax-free\nsecurities was exempted much in the same way as in\nIndia. It did not matter there who held them. Hughes v.\nThe Bank of New Zealand (21 T.C 472) cannot be\ndistinguished on the grounds mentioned by the Rangoon\nHigh Court.\nIn our judgment\nChellapa Chettiar v. C.I.T.\nMadras\n((1937) 5 I.T.R. 97.) was correctly decided.\n\nThe\ndecision of this Court in indore Malwa United )Wills v.\nC.I.T. (Central) Bombay\n([1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 310) is\ndistinguishable. It appears to us that it was because\ns. 14\n(2) (c)\nand\ns. 4\n(1 ) (a) and (c) existed at the relevant\ntime that the words 'profits and gains' in\ns. 24\nwere limited\nto such profits and gains as would have been assessable in\nBritish India or the taxable territories. This is apparent\nfrom the judgment and from the following observations of\nDas J.\n\n\"Reading the provisions in\nsection 24\nwith the provision in\n\nsection 4 (1) (a)\nand (c) and\nsection 14 (2) (c)\nit seems\nclear to us that\nsection 24 (1)\nwhen it talks of profits or\ngains has reference to taxable profits and gains; in other\nwords, it has reference to such profits and gains as would\nhave been assessable in British India or the taxable\nterritories. It has no reference to income accruing or\narising without British India or without taxable territories\nwhich were not liable to be assessed in the case of non-\nresidents.\"\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nWe cannot imply from this judgment that there is a\ngeneral principle that if a part of the income of a business\nis tax- free, expenditure incurred for the purpose of\nearning this income is outside the purview of\ns. 10\n.‖\n\n4.9 From the above it is quite evident that activities of the\nappellant are not limited to accepting deposit. They generate\nfunds from the deposits which are used by them to finance\nvarious other activities undertaken by the appellant and in\nprocess generate income by the use of such deposits. From the\nbalance sheet and profit loss account of M/s SIFCL it is evident\nthat they receive the deposits to fund and finance various\nactivities stated in their Memorandum of Association. The\nprinciple\nlaid down by\nthe Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case\n\nreferred above\nin para 4.5 is applied by the appellant themselves\nwhile making their financial statements.

balance sheet and profit and loss\naccount of the appellant it is quite evident that main input for all\nthe activities undertaken by M/s SIFCL is deposits received by\nthem under various schemes. The profits made by M/s SIFCL are\nused to project the financial health of the company to the\ndepositors and printed on the Forms for making deposit to gain\nthe confidence of the depositors. One such form is reproduced\nbelow:\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.11 In case of deposits or investments made by the depositors\nwith the appellant, the opportunity cost of investing in some\nother scheme of similar type is lost. The consideration for the\ndepositor is the risk associated with the investment/ deposit\nmade. Deposit made in one of the schemes floated by M/s\nSIFCL, is the foregone opportunity to invest in an alternative,\nriskier or less risky investment. As an investor moves higher on\nthe risk spectrum, the phrase TANSTAAFL becomes even more\nrelevant as investors provide capital with hopes of achieving\nlarger gains than what less-riskier deposits/ investments may\nmean. From the balance sheet and profit and loss account of M/s\nSIFCL reproduced above it is observed that the only input that\nthe M/s SIFCL receives is by way of collecting the deposits from\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nthe depositor to generate capital for further use. We refer to\nschedule 11 which gives the details of the interest earned on the\ndeposits made by the investors with Ms SIFCL and the Schedule\n15 which gives the interest paid out by M/s SIFCL. Schedule 11\nis in respect of the income of the appellants and schedule 15 is\nin respect of expenditure of the appellants in procuring these\ninvestments. The consideration in such a case can be well\nexplained by application of principal of TANSTAAFL.\nThus we do\nnot agree with the submissions made by the appellant in this\nregard that there is no consideration received by M/s SIFCL for\naccepting the deposit. The deposit made is itself the\nconsideration whereby the money of the depositor funds the\nactivities of M/s SIFCL. The depositor in a way transfers the right\nto use the money deposited to M/s SIFCL for earning profits by\napplication of those deposits. This transfer of right to use the\nfunds of depositors in terms of various definitions\nreferred above\n\nis consideration.\n\n4.12 Mumbai Bench had categorically agreed to the submission\nof similar nature as made in the present case that the accepting\ndeposits is without consideration and hence cannot be termed as\nservice. In case of ICICI Bank Ltd [2019 TIOL 589 CESTAT\nMumbai] following was observed:\n\n―37. It is a common knowledge that the customers deposit\ntheir money in the Banks and in turn receive interest as\nconsideration from the Banks. The money received by the\nBank from the customers is not kept idle but further\ninvested by them in various manners in furtherance to\ntheir Banking business, one such way is by providing loans\nor advances, for which the Banks receive consideration as\ninterest. The deposits kept in the Bank are in different\nforms like, saving bank deposit, current deposit, fixed\ndeposit etc. The consideration received by the customers,\nin the form of interest, and such deposit per se is not a\ntaxable service, since the consideration, in the form of\ninterest, does not come under the Service Tax net. Thus,\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nthe inference that could safely be drawn from the above\nanalysis is that even though deposit is an activity relating\nto banking business but not a taxable service under the\n\nFinance Act, 1994\n, as the consideration for such service is\nexempted.\n\n47.3 In para 32, Section 65B(44) definition of 'service' has\nbeen extracted. It clearly shows that for an activity to\nbe considered as a service, the said activity should\nbe performed for a consideration. The word\n'consideration' as used in the said section refers to\nthe consideration by the service recipient of the\nservice provided. Thus consideration is paid by\nrecipient to the service provider. In the present case\nthe deposits are being made by various depositors\nwith the financial institutions/banks. Banks need\nthese deposits for the purpose of conducting their\nbusiness and in turn for receiving deposits, paid\ncertain amounts as interest to the depositors. Thus\nbanks are not receiving any consideration for\ndeposits taken by them from the depositors. Even\notherwise the DICGC Act provides for protection of the\ninterest of the depositors and not the bank in case the\nbank goes worst. In absence of any consideration from\nthe depositors to the bank for the activity of\naccepting deposits, the same cannot be considered\nas a service in terms of Section 65 B (44).\"\n\nHowever the above has not been agreed to by the larger bench\nof Tribunal in case of South Indian Bank [2020 (41) G.S.T.L. 609\n(Tri. - LB)] wherein following has been observed:\n\n―9. The banks claim that they are engaged in ―accepting‖\ndeposits from the public, which deposits are used for the\npurpose of lending or investment and though no consideration\nis charged for making the deposits, but the banks thereafter\nprovide number of services like discounting of cheques,\nminimum balance charges, handling charges for gold loans,\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nlocker rent and similar services, which are in relation to\n―banking and other financial services‖ and are chargeable to\nservice tax as consideration for providing such services are\nnot received in the form of interest. The list of services on\nwhich the banks have to pay service tax under ―banking and\nother financial services‖, can be bifurcated into two\ncategories. The first category consists of services which have\na direct nexus with the activity of ―accepting‖ deposits, while\nthe second category consists of those services which have a\ndirect nexus with the ―lending‖ activity of the banks. The\nservices under the aforesaid two categories have been stated\nby the banks to be as follows :\n\n(i) Direct nexus with the activity of accepting deposits.\n\na. Charges towards issuance of Cheque book;\nb. Charges to maintain minimum balance;\n\nc. Debit Card charges;\n\nd. Duplicate Pass Book/Bank Statement charges.\ne. Stop payment charges\nf. Cheque return charges\ng. Demand Draft charges\nh. Charges for providing bank guarantee\ni. Safe deposit locker facilities; etc.\n\n(ii) Direct nexus with the lending activity.\n\na. Processing fee towards obtaining necessary\nsanctions/ approvals for lending money to\ncustomers;\n\nb. Documentation charges towards completing loan\nsanction with respect to preparing, printing and\nexecuting the various documents required post\nappropriate sanctions/approvals being taken.\nc. Inspection charges towards compensation for the\ntime spent in visiting and inspecting the\nfactory/godown/other assets of the borrowers.\n\n44. The basic activity of a banking company, as\ncontemplated under the definition of ―banking‖, either\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nunder the Deposit Insurance Act or the\nBanking Regulation\nAct\n, is to accept deposits from the public, which deposits\nare used for the purpose of lending or investment by the\nbanks. Thus, the main activity of a banking company is to\nmobilise the resources received by the banks in the form of\ndeposits from the public for the purpose of lending or\ninvestment. These deposits, thus generate returns for the\nbanks. A part of the returns is given by the banks to the\ndepositors as a consideration, which consideration is\nnormally in the form of interest.\n\n45. What also needs to be noticed is that the lending and\ninvestment portfolio of banks are required to be funded by\ndeposits and the funds of the shareholders. The Credit\nDeposit ratio is the percentage of how much the banks\nlend out of the deposits they have mobilised and also\nindicates how much of the core funds of the banks are\nbeing utilised for lending. A higher ratio indicates more\nreliance on deposits for lending. In such circumstances,\nthe raising of deposits is an important function of the\nbanks. In other words, the acceptance of deposits is not\nonly a pre-requisite for lending but is also necessary for\nthe banks since the entire activity undertaken by the bank\nbegins with the acceptance of deposits, without which the\nsubsequent activities of lending or investment cannot be\nundertaken by the banks.\n\n52. It is not in dispute that after accepting the deposits\nthere are a number of services on which the banks have to\npay service tax under ―banking and other financial\nservices‖. These services are in connection with both the\n―accepting‖ of deposits and ―lending‖ activity of the banks.\nBanks would be able to lend only if they accept deposits. It\nhas been seen that without payment of insurance premium\non the outstanding deposits, banks will not be able to\nfunction or render any output service of ―banking and\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nother financial services‖ and the licence granted to the\nbanks by the Reserve Bank of India can be cancelled.\n\n54. The contention of the Department is that ―accepting‖\nof deposits is covered under\nSection 66D(n)\nof the Finance\nAct which contains the negative list. As noticed above, the\nnegative list comprises, under sub-clause (n) of Section\n66D, services by way of extending deposits, loans or\nadvances in so far as the consideration is represented by\nway of interest or discount. The issue is whether extending\ndeposits would mean the activity of accepting deposits.\nThe activity of accepting deposits would be an activity\nwhere the banks receive deposits from the customers in\nthe form of savings account, recurring deposits, for which\nthe banks pay interest to the customers. On the other\nhand, the extending of deposits would be an activity of a\nbank giving its surplus money in the form of deposit to\nanother person, where the consideration received would be\nin the form of interest. This would be a case where in the\ncourse of banking activities, one bank makes a deposit\nwith another bank for which it receives consideration in the\nform of interest. It is this consideration received by the\nbanks in the form of interest which has been specified\nunder\nSection 66D(n)\nof the Finance Act in the negative\nlist of services. Thus, in case of accepting deposits, the\nbanks have to pay interest to the customers, whereas\nwhile extending deposits, the banks receive interest from\nother banks. It is for this reason that inter-bank deposits\nare not included in the returns filed by the banks with the\nDeposit Insurance Corporation for calculating the premium\npayable. The banks cannot avail credit of service tax on\nany amount of interest earned on extending of deposits. It\nis, therefore, not possible to accept the contention of the\nDepartment that ―accepting‖ of deposits is covered under\n\nSection 66D(n)\nof the Finance Act.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n64. This view has been taken by the Tribunal in State\nBank of Bikaner. However, in ICICI Bank a contrary view\nwas taken. For ―all the reasons stated above, it is not\npossible to accept the view taken by the Division Bench of\nthe Tribunal in ICICI Bank.‖\n\nThus in view of\nthe above decision\nof the larger bench we\nare not in position to agree with the submissions made by\nthe appellant in this regard.\n\n4.13 The circular of 2003 was not quashed by the Hon'ble\nAndhra Pradesh High Court in case of Karvy Securities Ltd.\n[2006 (2) STR 481 (AP)] as argued by the appellant, holding\nthat circular clarified contrary to legal provisions but has been\nquashed for the reason that Board was not having jurisdiction to\ninterfere in the matters which need to be decided by the\nauthorities in adequate proceedings. Hon'ble High Court has held\nas follows:\n\n\"6. From bare perusal of the circular it would be\nemphatically known that the respondents raised two\nspecific questions. First question is, Whether the\ncommission received by distributors on mutual fund\ndistribution as liable to Service Tax under the category of\nBusiness Auxiliary Services? Second one is, Whether the\nservices provided is exempt from service tax in terms of\nNotification No. 13/2003, dated 20-6-2003?\n\n7. It appears that there is a notification granting\nexemptions and this notification has been categorically\ninterpreted by the circular by saying that the activity does\nnot get covered under exemption notification. We fail to\nunderstand whether the authorities would go against the\ndirections given in the circular. Besides that, the circular is\nalso, in our view, contrary to the proviso to\nSection 37B\nof\nthe Central Excise Act, 1944 (for short ‗the Act'). Section\n37B reads as under :\n\n―The Central Board of Excise and Customs constituted\nunder the\nCentral Boards of Revenue Act, 1963\n(54 of\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n1963), may, if it considers it necessary or expedient so to\ndo for the purpose of uniformity in the classification of\nexcisable goods or with respect to levy of duties of excise\non such goods, issue such orders, instructions and\ndirections to the Central Excise Officers as it may deem fit,\nand such officers and all other persons employed in the\nexecution of this Act shall observe and follow such orders,\ninstructions and directions of the said Board :\n\nPROVIDED that no such orders, instructions or directions\nshall be issued--\n\n(a) so as to require any Central Excise Officer to make\nparticular assessment or to dispose of a particular case in\na particular manner; or\n\n(b) so as to interfere with the discretion of the\n[Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals)] in the exercise\nof his appellate functions.‖\n\n8. If the circular is read along with clause (a) to proviso\nto Section 37B, it becomes abundantly clear that if circular\nis applied, the matters have to be decided in accordance\nwith the directions given in the circular.\n\n9. For these reasons, we feel that the circular is illegal,\ncontrary to the proviso to\nSection 37B(a)\nof the Act and is\naccordingly quashed. Writ Petition is allowed. By allowing\nthe writ petition, we have not expressed any opinion about\nthe notification and applicability of it in a particular case or\ncases shall have to be determined by the appropriate\nauthorities. No costs.\"\n\nAffirming the above order Hon'ble Supreme Court as reported at\n[2015 (39) STR 705 (SC)] has observed as follows:\n\n―The undisputed facts are that the Government had issued\nNotification No. 13 of 2003-S.T. whereby it exempted the\n‗Business Auxiliary Services provided by a commission\nagent' from the Service Tax leviable thereon under sub-\nsection (2) of\nSection 66\nof the Finance Act, 1994.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nThereafter, Circular dated 5-11-2003 was issued in which\nit is stated that having regard to some doubts that had\narisen regarding application of Service Tax on the activity\nof mutual fund distribution, it was clarified that the\ncommission received by distributors on mutual fund\ndistribution would be liable to Service Tax as it would not\nfall within the expression ‗Business Auxiliary Services'. This\ncircular dated 5-11-2003 has been set aside by the High\nCourt in the impugned judgment on the ground that it\namounts to foreclosing discretion or judgment that may be\nexercised by the quasi-judicial authority while deciding a\nparticular lies under particular circumstances. The High\nCourt referred to the proviso to\nSection 37B\nof the Central\nExcise Act, 1944, which categorically states that such kind\nof circulars cannot be issued. We, thus, do not find any\nerror in the impugned judgment. This appeal is accordingly\ndismissed.‖\n\nThus by quashing this circular the issue has been left open\nby the Hon‟ble Apex Court to be decided by the authorities in\naccordance with law. After quoting this circular Commissioner\nhas in the impugned order examined the provision of law and\nthe facts involved and arrived at her own findings in matter.\n\n4.14 The issue with regards to applicability of\nSection 65 (19)\n\nneeds to be considered in terms of the definition as it existed\nthen. Commissioner has in the impugned order analyzing the\ndefinition as it existed during the relevant period vis a vis the\nfacts of the present case observed as follows:\n\n―The noticee have contended that the allegation in the\nshow cause notice is with reference to the promotion in\nmarketing of the business of client and that the definition\nunder\nSection 65 (19)\nof FA'94 relates to promotion and\nmarketing of services by their client and not the business\nof the client. The very business of the Noticee is in nature\nof service as they are encouraging saving habits among\npublic, facilitating successful launching/ running of saving\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nschemes. Indirectly they are engaged in mobilization of\nfunds from public which tantamount to service. The word\n‗business‖ used in the notice in relation to ‗promoting and\nmarketing of the business of client' is with reference to\nsub clause (ii) of Clues 19 of\nSection 65\nof the FA'94 which\ninter alis is ‗promotion and marketing of service provided\nby the client'. In this connection it is observed that M/s\nSIFCL are not dealing with goods which implies that they\nare engaged in providing services i.e. their business comes\nunder the purview of service sector. Therefore the term\n―promoting and marketing of business‖ of M/s SIFCL by\nthe noticee shall be construed accordingly i.e. promoting\nand marketing of service. Hence the contention of the\nNoticee is not acceptable and the service provided by the\nNoticee is well covered under clause (ii) of the definition of\n―BAS‖ w.e.f 01.07.2003.\n\nFrom the perusal of the Show Cause Notice it is seen\nthat the notice proposes that the activities of the noticee is\nvery much covered under sub-clause (ii) and (iv) of clause\n19 of\nSection 65\nof the FA'94 and further, since 10.9.04, in\nsub clause (vi) of Clause 19 of\nSection 65\nof the FA 94.\n\nThe SCN, nowhere alleges the noticee of providing services\nas defined in sub-clause (1) and () of the Clause 19 of\n\nSection 65\nof the FA'94 and after 10.9.04 does not allege\nthe noticee of providing services in sub clause (iv) and (v)\nof the Clause 19 of\nSection 65\nof the FA'94. Therefore\nnoticee's contention in their defence reply needs no further\ndiscussion.\n\nRegarding noticee's contention that since they are\nnot providing services under subclause (i), (ii) and (iii) of\n\"Business Auxiliary Services\", as it existed upto 9.9.04, the\nprovisions of sub-clause (iv) and later sub-clause (vii) is\nnot applicable in their case, it is seen from the definition of\nBAS during 01.07.03 to 09.09.04 that Sub clause-(iv) is\nindependent of sub clause (i), (ii) and (iii). There is\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nnothing in the Section to suggest that the definition of\n\"BAS\" is to be interpreted the way as made by the noticee.\nThe use of the word \"or\" at the end of each sub-clause is\nmore than sufficient to understand as to how the definition\nis to be interpreted. On perusal of the Sub clause (iv) of\nthe definition it is clear that \"Business Auxiliary Services\"\n\nincludes any incidental or auxiliary support service such as\nbilling, collection or recovery of cheques, accounts and\nremittance, evaluation of prospective customer and public\nrelation services.\n\nNow I refer to the judicial pronouncements of Apex Court\nwith regards to the interpretation of statute.\n\n(i) Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nDoypack\nSystems Pvt. Ltd, Vs UOI,1988\n(36)ELT 201, in para 56\nhas held:\n\n\"The words in the statute must, prima facie, be given its\nordinary meaning. Where the grammatical construction is\nclear and manifest and without doubt, the construction\nought to prevail unless there are some strong and obvious\nreasons to the contrary.\"\n\nFurther to quote Para 57 of the same case:\n\n\".....The dominant purpose in construing a statue is to\nascertain the intention of the legislature as expressed in\nthe statue, considering it as a whole and its context. That\nintention, and therefore the meaning of the statue, is\nprimarily to be sought in the words used in the statute\nitself, which must, if they are plain and unambiguous, be\napplied as they stand.\"\n\n(ii) In\nHemraj Gordhandas Vs Assistant Collector of\nCustoms and Central Excise\n, AIR 1970SC 755, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court held that in a taxing statute, there was no\nroom for intendment.\n\n(ii) In\nTata Consultancy Service Vs State of Andhra\nPradesh\n, 2004(178) ELT 22, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nheld that ordinarily statute had to be literally construed\nand same cannot be denied merely because consequences\nof such interpretation may lead to penalty.\n\n(iv) In the case of Commissioner of Central Excise,\nChandigarh-Il Vs. Bhalla Enterprises,2004(173) ELT 225\n(S.C), it was held that the principle of strict/liberal\ninterpretation applies only in case of ambiguity, otherwise\nplain words of the statute must be given effect.\n\nIn all the pronouncements it is, therefore, clearly\nheld that the taxing statute has to be implemented literally\nin the plain words as mentioned in the statute. There is no\nambiguity in the words used in the aforesaid provisions of\nService Tax Laws regarding the definition of \"BAS\" and the\nplea of the noticee that they were not providing \"BAS\"\nduring 01.07.03 to 09.09.04 is not acceptable. The name\nof the service itself suggests that all auxiliary activities\nwhich support business must be brought into the ambit of\nBAS.\n\nAfter 10.9.04, the noticee is covered under sub-\nclause (vi) of Clause 19 of\nSection 65\nof the FA'94. The\nsubmission of the noticee is that SIFCL (Principal) is not\nproviding any taxable service, accordingly noticee would\nnot be covered under \"BAS\" The noticee has also pleaded\nthat their activities promote business of the clients but the\nservices are not rendered to the client, therefore, they do\nnot come under purview of \"BAS\".\n\nThe provision of service by noticee on behalf of M/S\nSIFCL in the nature of deployment of manpower and\nparaphernalia in implementing the scheme devised by M/s\nSIFCL is evident. Therefore, noticee has provided services\nfalling under Sub clause (vi) of the definition of BAS\n(Auxiliary and Support Service) incidental service. The plea\nadvanced by the noticee in this regard that there is no\nprovision of service is not correct and hence unacceptable.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n22. On perusal of MOU effective from 01.04.01 and\n20.09.2003 entered between the Noticee and M/S SIFCL, it\nis observed that the Noticee is having well equipped\ninfrastructure facilities, having more than 1500 offices with\nthe required manpower at various places and in different\npart of the country. The staff and officers of the Noticee\nhave sufficient expertise for running business of savings\nand finance by deploying their field staff and field force like\nAgents, Field Officers etc. The field workers of the Noticee\ncontract to the perspective customers and apprise about\nvarious schemes of savings launched by M/S SIFCL, to\npersuade depositors/customers in promoting the business\nof M/S SIFCL. The MOU dated 20.09.03 states that\n\"Sahara India shall continue to work as Agent to Sahara\nIndia Financial Corporation Limited to conduct,\npromote introduce and secure business on behalf of\nSahara India Financial Corporation Limited under all\nits scheme - which may be changed varied, suspended and\nmodified from time to time as per instruction of Sahara\nIndia Financial Corporation Limited.\"\n\nThe definition of BAS include the services provided\nby a commercial concern in relation to not only promotion,\nmarketing of services, provided by a client, but also any\nincidental or auxiliary service commission such as billing,\ncollection or recovery of cheques, accounts and\nremittance, evaluation of prospective customer and public\nrelation services. The use of the term \"such as clearly\nindicates the definition provided is only illustrative and not\nexhaustive. There can be other service / services though\nnot specified in definition which can be classified as\nauxiliary services and therefore will be liable to service tax\nunder this category of service.\n\nThe word \"Service\" as defined in Legal Glossary of\nGovernment of India (2001) means \"the action of serving,\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nhelping or befitting, conduct tending to the welfare or\nadvantage of another.........\n\nThe dictionary (Oxford Modern English Dictionary) meaning\nof word 'Service' is the act of helping or doing the work for\nanother.\n\nHence the definition of Business Auxiliary Services as\nprovided under\nSection 65\nof Finance Act, 1994 has to be\nconstrued in much wider sense encompassing other\nactivities under the clause of 'service incidental or auxiliary\nsimilar to the nature of define services in other different\nclauses of the definition.\n\nIt is seen that the noticee is acting as agent of M/s\nSIFCL as per clause (1) of MOU effective from 1.4.2001\nand they are paid commission for provision of services as\nmentioned in the MOU between both the commercial\nconcerns. The nature of work performed by the noticee is\npurely incidental or auxiliary service on commission basis\nto M/S SIFCL provided to customer, issuing receipt of\npayments from the depositors under various scheme of\nSIFCL, accountal of the money received and the payments\non maturity for M/S SIFCL. In the facts of the case there is\nno doubt about the provision of service by the noticee to\nM/S SIFCL which are taxable under the provisions of\nService Tax and they fall within the BAS. It can therefore\nbe concluded that the noticee are service provider and M/S\nSIFCL are service receiver and the relationship between\nthe two is that of service provider and client.\n\n22.1 On careful examination of the memorandum of\nundertaking between the partners it is seen that the\nnoticee is an agent of M/S SIFCL in every reasonable way\nincluding the provision of the services as agent rendered\nunder agreement for which the commission is paid to\nthem. It is not in dispute that M/S SIFCL shall pay the\nnoticee towards expenses incurred in running of its office,\nbranches and noticee is rendering all services as agent.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nThe agreement which is a part of MOU, elaborate the\nsystem of working and covers different aspects of the\nfunctioning by the noticee. The nature of services provided\nby the noticee have also been mentioned in the said\nagreement which states collection of requisite amount from\nmembers under different saving schemes and arrangement\nof payment of maturity, pre-maturity and loans to the\ndepositors etc. The nature of the services provided by the\nnoticee is corroborated in the statements as detailed supra\nin the brief facts of the case. All the office bearers of the\nnoticee firm have categorically admitted the fact of\nprovision of the services to their principal M/S SIFCL. The\nnature of the services is apparently covered under\nconducting. promoting, introducing and securing business\non behalf of M/S SIFCL and the noticee has all\ninfrastructure and work force available with them for\nenhancing the business of their client for set of\nconsideration as stipulated in MOU's entered during\nrelevant period. The activities of the noticee are to be\ncovered under BAS defined under clause 19 of the\nSec.65\n\nof the FA'94 as amended from time to time since\n01.07.2003, Thus it is seen that the noticee has rendered\nauxiliary services to M/S SIFCL and for which the receipt of\nmoney as commission as agreed upon and thus there is a\nservice provider - client (service receiver), relationship\nbetween noticee and SIFCL.\n\nThe Noticee had pleaded that in their case there was\nno client and accordingly no service tax could be leviable\non them. They have submitted that the existence of a\nclient, Service provider and payment for the service are\nthree parameters for levy Service Tax. In their case there\nis no client and they are not liable to pay service tax.\n\nHowever the noticee has understood the meaning of\nthe word 'client' in a very narrow sense on the basis of the\nmeanings given in different dictionaries. In Service Tax law\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nit is receiver of the service who is referred different names\ni.e. client, subscriber, person etc. as per the\nSection 65\nof\nFA'94 covering the definitions of different terms which\nultimately demote the service receiver. The three\nparameters to quality to cover under service tax law or (i)\nService recipient, (ii) service provider & (iii) payments\nmade (consideration) which are satisfied in the present\ncase.\n\nOn the basis of the facts of the case, the inference\ndrawn is that all three prerequisite for coverage under\nService Tax, namely, event of provision of service tax,\npresence of taxable service provider and service receiver\nand the act of rendering taxable services against\ncommission are present in the instant case.\n\nIn the present case, SIFCL (entity) have employed\nnoticee (professional) for supporting in their \"para banking\noperations\" service relating to collection of money from the\ninvestors, preparing bills, collecting them and accounting\nthe same etc., which otherwise would have carried by the\nSIFCL and the noticee is paid commission on such services,\nthus establishing service provider - client relationship with\nthe SIFCL. The said activity, carried out by the noticee, is\nthat of \"Service Provider\" and the \"Service Receiver is\nSIFCL. The Service Tax is, therefore leviable as per law.\n\nIn the net analysis I find that w.e.f. 10.09.2004 the\nprovision of service on behalf of the client is covered under\n\"Business Auxiliary Services\". I, therefore, hold that during\n10.09.2004 to 31.07.2006 there was provision of\n\"Business Auxiliary Services\" by the noticee was liable to\nservice tax as per the provision of Service Tax law.‖\n\n4.15 From the perusal of the definition as per\nSection 65 (19)\n,\nfor the period prior to its amendment with effect from\n10.09.2004, it is evident that (iv) is an independent entry and is\nnot linked with any of the entries at (i), (ii) & (iii) all the entries\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nare separated by „or‟. Even at the cost of repetition we reproduce\nthe entry at (iv) below:\n\n(iv) any incidental or auxiliary support service such\nas billing, collection or recovery of cheques,\naccounts and remittances, evaluation of prospective\ncustomer and public relation services,\",\n\nEven if the activity of accepting deposits by SIFCL, during this\nperiod is held to be no service as claimed by the appellant, the\nactivities of appellant will qualify as incidental and auxiliary\nsupport services, provided by the appellant to the business of\nthe M/s SIFCL. Hon‟ble Supreme Court has in the case of M/s\nGood Year India Ltd [1997 (95) ELT 450 (SC)] held as follows:\n\n\"2. ..... The words \"such as stainless steel, nickel\nmonel, incoloy, hastelloy\" in sub-heading (2) are\nonly illustrative of the various metals from which\nvalves can be made but the said description is not\nexhaustive of the metals. If the material from which\nthe valves are made is a corrosion-resisting material\nthen the valves would fall under sub-heading (2) of\nHeading 84.61. ....\"\n\nRelying on this decision Hon‟ble Bombay High Court has in the\ncase of Coca Cola India Pvt Ltd [2009 (15) STR 657 (Bom)] held\nas follows:\n\n24. The next expression to be considered from the\ndefinition is ‗such as'. A few dictionary meanings of the\nterm ‗such as' are reproduced. Concise Oxford Dictionary,\nSuch as means for example or of a kind that; Chambers\nDictionary, such as means for example :\n\nIn\nGood Year India Ltd. v. Collector of Customs\n- 1997\n(95) E.L.T. 450 the Supreme Court observed as under :\n\n....\n\nThe words such as therefore are illustrative and not\nexhaustive. In the context of business, those are services,\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nrelated to the business. They may not be exhaustive, but\nare illustrative.\n\n25. The expression Business is an integrated/continuous\nactivity and is not confined restricted to mere manufacture\nof the product. Therefore, activities in relation to business\ncan cover all the activities that are related to the\nfunctioning of a business. The term business therefore, in\nour opinion cannot be given a restricted definition to say\nthat business of a manufacturer is to manufacture final\nproducts only. In a case like the present, business of\nassessee being an integrated activity comprising of\nmanufacture of concentrate, entering in to franchise\nagreement with bottlers permitting use of brand name by\nbottlers promotion of brand name, etc. the expression will\nhave to be seen in that context See (i) Pepsi Foods Ltd. v.\n\nCollector - 1996 (82) E.L.T. 33, (ii) Pepsi Foods Ltd. v.\nCollector - 2003 (158) E.L.T. 552 (S.C.).\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nState of Karnataka v.\nShreyas Paper Pvt. Ltd.\n2006 SCC affirmed the view taken\nby the Hon'ble Karnataka High Court reported at 2001\n(121) STC 738, which, inter alia, held as under :\n\nBusiness comprises of the regular and systematic activity\nwith an object of earning of profits. The machinery, plant,\nbuilding and the land over which they have erected or\nconstructed are only the tools of such business. Assets and\nliabilities including goodwill are the necessary ingredients\nto constitute a business, besides the stocks and other\nmovable and immovable items connected with the said\nbusiness.\n\nIn\nMazgaon Dock Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income\ntax and\nExcess Profits Tax - AIR 1958 SC 861 the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt held as follows :\n\n14. The word ―business‖ is, as has often been said, one\nof the wide import and in fiscal statutes, it must be\nconstrued in a broad rather than a restricted sense.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n15. ―The word ‗business connotes‖, it was observed by\nthis court in\nNarain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v.\nCommissioner of Excess Profits Tax\n, 1955 1 SCR 952\n―some real, substantial and systematic or organized course\nof activity or conduct with a set purpose.‖\n\nThe term ―business‖ therefore, particularly in fiscal,\nstatutes is of wide import.\n\nAgreeing with\nthe above decision\nHon‟ble Bombay High Court\nhas in case of Ultratech Cement [2010 (260) E.L.T. 369 (Bom.)]\nheld as follows:\n\n―35. The argument of the Revenue, that the expression\n―such as‖ in the definition of input service is exhaustive\nand is restricted to the services named therein, is also\ndevoid of any merit, because, the substantive part of the\ndefinition of ‗input service' as well as the inclusive part of\nthe definition of ‗input service' purport to cover not only\nservices used prior to the manufacture of final products,\nsubsequent to the manufacture of final products but also\nservices relating to the business such as accounting,\nauditing..... etc. Thus the definition of input service seeks\nto cover every conceivable service used in the business of\nmanufacturing the final products. Moreover, the categories\nof services enumerated after the expression ‗such as' in\nthe definition of ‗input service' do not relate to any\nparticular class or category of services, but refer to variety\nof services used in the business of manufacturing the final\nproducts. There is nothing in the definition of ‗input\nservice' to suggest that the Legislature intended to define\nthat expression restrictively. Therefore, in the absence of\nany intention of the Legislature to restrict the definition of\n‗input service' to any particular class or category of\nservices used in the business, it would be reasonable to\nconstrue that the expression ‗such as' in the inclusive part\nof the definition of input service is only illustrative and not\nexhaustive. Accordingly, we hold that all services used in\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nrelation to the business of manufacturing the final product\nare covered under the definition of ‗input service' and in\nthe present case, the outdoor catering services being\nintegrally connected with the business of the manufacture\nof cement, credit of service tax paid out on catering\nservices has been rightly allowed by the Tribunal.\n\n36. The argument of the Revenue that the expression\n―such as‖ in Rule 2(l) of 2004 Rules is restricted to the\ncategories specified therein, runs counter to the C.B.E.C.\nCircular No. 97, dated 23rd August, 2007. In that Circular\nthe C.B.E.C. (vide para 8.3) has held that the credit of\nservice tax paid in respect of mobile phone service is\nadmissible provided the mobile phone is used for providing\noutput service or used in or in relation to manufacture of\nfinished goods. Mobile phone service is neither used in the\nmanufacture of final product nor it is specifically included\nin the definition of input service. Even then, the C.B.E.C.\nhas construed the definition of input service widely so as to\ncover not only the services specifically enumerated in the\ndefinition of ‗input service' but also cover all services which\nare used in relation to the business of manufacturing the\nfinal products. Therefore, the argument of the revenue\nwhich runs counter to stand taken by the C.B.E.C. cannot\nbe accepted.\n\n37.\nIn the case of\nCoca Cola India Pvt. Ltd.\n(supra) a\nDivision Bench of this Court has considered scope of the\nexpression ―input service‖ as defined in Rule 2(l) of 2004\nRules. In that case, the question for consideration was,\nwhether a manufacturer of non-alcoholic beverage bases\n(concentrates) is eligible to avail credit of service tax paid\non advertisement, sales promotion, market research etc.\n\nThe argument of the revenue\nin that case\nwas that the\nadvertisements are not relatable to the concentrate\nmanufactured by\nCoca Cola India Pvt. Ltd.\n(supra) and\nhence, the credit in respect thereof cannot be allowed.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nConsidering the Finance Minister's Budget Speech for\n2004-05, press note issued by the Ministry of finance along\nwith the Draft 2004 Rules and various decisions of the\nApex Court, this Court held that the expression ‗activities\nin relation to business' in the inclusive part of the definition\nof ‗input service' further widens the scope of input service\nso as to cover all services used in the business of\nmanufacturing the final products and that the said\ndefinition is not restricted to the services enumerated in\nthe definition of input service itself. The Court rejected the\ncontention of the revenue that a service to qualify as an\ninput service must be used in or in relation to the\nmanufacture of the final products and held that any service\nused in relation to the business of manufacturing the final\nproduct would be an eligible input service.\n\n38. We concur with\nthe above decision\nof this Court in the\ncase of\nCoca Cola India Pvt. Ltd.\n(supra)...‖\n\n4.16 It is the submission of the appellants that by\nFinance Act,\n, the sub\nsection 104(c)\nwas inserted in the\nSection 65\nof\nthe Finance Act, 1994 defining the business support services as\nfollows:\n\n―support services of business or commerce‖ means\nservices provided in relation to business or commerce and\nincludes evaluation of prospective customers,\ntelemarketing, processing of purchase orders and\nfulfillment services, information and tracking of delivery\nschedules, managing distribution and logistics, customer\nrelationship management services, accounting and\nprocessing of transactions, operational assistance for\nmarketing, formulation of customer service and pricing\npolicies, infrastructural support services and other\ntransaction processing.\n\nExplanation.--For the purposes of this clause, the\nexpression ―infrastructural support services‖ includes\nproviding office along with office utilities, lounge, reception\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nwith competent personnel to handle messages, secretarial\nservices, internet and telecom facilities, pantry and\nsecurity; ';\n\nAs they are covered by the definition as introduced by the\n\nFinance Act, 2006\nthey took the registration under this category\nand started paying service tax under this category. It is the\nsubmission of the appellant thus that they are providing support\nservices to the business of M/s SIFCL and hence they are not\ncovered by the scope of any clause\nSection 65 (19)\n. They rely on\nthe following decisions of to buttress their arguments:\n\n⮚ Indian national Ship-owners Association [2009 (14)\nSTR 289 (Bom)]\n⮚ CBRE South Asia Pvt Ltd [2020-TIOL-197-CESTAT-\nDel\n⮚ CBRE South Asia Pvt Ltd [2021-TIOL-06-SC-ST-LB]\n⮚ Malviya National Institute of Technology [2019 (6)\nTMI 127-CESTAT New Delhi]\n⮚ Global Coal & Mining Pvt Ltd [2020 (36) GSTL 77 (T-\nDel)]\n⮚ Capital Transport Convoy Contractor [2016 (2) TMI\n546 CESTAT New Delhi]\n\n4.17 These decisions do not support the case of appellant as in\nall the cases the court/ tribunal concluded that the services\nprovided were not classifiable under the earlier entry and\nbecame taxable only after introduction of new entry. In the\npresent case when we conclude that the services provided by the\nappellant were classifiable under the taxable category of\nBusiness Auxiliary Services, subsequent introduction of new\nservice will not alter the classification of service. The crux of the\nissue is that classification of the service is to be considered in\nterms of the definition as it existed at the relevant time. Our\nview is strengthened by the provisions contained in\nSection 65 A\n\nof Finance Act, 1994 and reproduced below:\n\n\"65A Classification of Taxable Services,-\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, classification of\ntaxable services shall be determined according to\nthe terms of the sub clause s of clause (10% of\n\nSection 65\n.\n\n(2) When for any reason, a taxable service is prima\nfacie, classifiable under two or more sub-clauses\nof clause 9105) of\nsection 65\nclassification shall\nbe effected as follows:\n\n(a) The sub clasuse which provides the most\nspecific description shall be preferred to sub\nclauses providing a more general\ndescription.\n\n(b) ......\n\n(c) ....‖\n\n4.18 It is also noted that the appellant had never before raised\nthis ground either before the adjudicating authority or in their\nappeal memo. Hence this ground which has been urged for first\ntime at the time of hearing of appeal cannot be admitted in view\nof the observations as follows made by the Ahmedabad Bench in\nthe case of DLF Limited [2014 (302) ELT 303 (T-Ahmd)]:\n\n―6.So far as the issues outlined at para 2(iv) an (v) above\nare concerned it is observed that the same were not raised\nby the appellant before the lower authorities and have also\nnot been raised in the grounds of appeal before us,\ntherefore, the same cannot allowed to be raised at the\ntime of final hearing before CESTAT for the first time.‖\n\n4.19 Appellant have relied upon the decision of tribunal in case\nof Jetlite (India) Ltd [2011 (21) STR 119 (T-Del)] and Steria\nIndia Limited [2017-TIOL-3837-CESTAT-ALL to argue that for\nholding the services rendered by them to the service recipient,\nto be taxable under these clauses of\nSection 65 (19)\n, it is\nnecessary to show that the service recipient was providing\ntaxable services to the third party. However on perusal we do\nnot find any such averment made in any of these orders. In case\nof Jetlite, tribunal has observed:\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n\"61.\nThe Finance Act, 1994\ndoes not define the term\n―Service‖. It merely describes the expression ―Taxable\nService‖. As far as the matter in hand is concerned the\nliability of the appellants is said to be in terms of\nSection\n65(19)(ii)\nread with\nSection 65(105)(zzb)\nof the said Act.\n\n62.\nSection 65(19)\nof the said Act defines the ―Business\nAuxiliary Services‖ and under clause (ii) thereof it provides\nthat Business Auxiliary Service means, any service in\nrelation to promotion or marketing of service provided by\nthe client.\nSection 65(105)(zzb)\ndefines the ―Taxable\nService‖ means, any service provided or to be provided to\na client by any person in relation to Business Auxiliary\nService. In fact, the expression ―any person‖ was\nsubstituted for the earlier expression ―a commercial\nconcern‖ since 18th April, 2006, consequent to the\namendment to\nFinance Act\n.\n\n63. Perusal of the above provisions of law, therefore,\nwould disclose that a person can be said to have rendered\nBusiness Auxiliary Service in terms of the provisions of law\nin force, on being established that he has rendered service\nin relation to either promotion or marketing of some\nservice provided by the client. The fact, that the service\nprovider has rendered the service of promotion or\nmarketing of the service provided to others by the service\nrecipient, has to be established before such person can be\nsaid to have rendered the taxable service which can be\nclassified under the said clause. Unless the service\nrecipient is shown to have been engaged in rendering\nsome service to others and the service provider is shown\nto have rendered his service for promotion or marketing of\nsuch service provided by the service recipient to others,\nthe question of creating liability under the said Act in terms\nof\nSection 65(19)(ii)\nread with 65(105) (zzb) of the said\nAct does not arise.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n65. As already stated above, the term ―Service‖ has not\nbeen defined under the said Act. In Black's Law Dictionary\nthe term ―service‖ has been defined to be an act of doing\nsomething useful for a person or a company for a fee. The\nexpression ―service charges‖ is defined therein to mean\ncharge assessed for performing of service, such as charges\nassessed by bank against the expenses of maintaining or\nservicing a customer checking account. Even while defining\nthe term taxable service under the said Act, the definition\nspecifies the taxable service to mean any service provided\nor to be provided to any person whereas the business\nauxiliary service has been defined to mean any service in\nrelation to the service provided by the client. Being so,\ntaking into consideration the common understanding of the\ndefinition of the term ―service‖ as well as the definition of\nthe term ―taxable service‖ under the said Act, it is evident\nthat the service contemplated under\nSection 65(19)\nis the\none which relates to service rendered by the service\nrecipient. It may be taxable service or may not be so.\nHowever, the situation invariably contemplates existence\nof two entities in order to bring the case within the scope\nof definition of business auxiliary service. One entity which\nprovides service to others is called a service recipient.\nAnother entity is one which provides service to the service\nrecipient in relation to the service rendered by such service\nrecipient to others, and such entity is called the service\nprovider.\n\n77. The discussion on the point in issue would be\nincomplete without reference to some more decisions of\nthe Apex Court, and they are\nTamilnadu Kalyan Mandapam\nAssociation v.

Apart from proper maintenance of\nthe mandap, they were providing the necessary\nparaphernalia for holding function, besides providing\ncondition and ambience required by the customers which\nincluded provision for lighting arrangements, furniture and\nfixtures, floor covering etc, decoration and organizing\ncatering services in the mandap. In fact, the logistic of\nsetting up, selection and maintenance was the\nresponsibility of the Mandap Keeper. The services of\nMandap Keeper could not possibly be termed as a higher\npurchase agreement of a right to use goods or property.\nThe services provided by Mandap Keeper are professional\nservices which he alone by virtue of his experience as the\nwherewithal to provide. However, temporary occupation of\nmandap does not involve transfer of the property either\nunder\nTransfer of Proper Act\nor otherwise. The nature and\ncharacter of the Service tax levied on Mandap Keeper is in\nrelation to transaction between the Mandap Keeper and his\ncustomer which is essentially that of providing a service.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n79.\nIn\nFakir Chand Gulati\ncase, the point for consideration\nbefore the Apex Court was whether a land owner who\nenters into agreement with a builder for construction of an\napartment building and for sharing of the constructed area\nis a consumer entitled to maintain a complaint against the\nbuilder as a service provider under the\nConsumer\nProtection Act, 1986\n. It was held therein that the basic\nunderlying purpose of such agreement is the construction\nof a house or an apartment in accordance with the\nspecification by builder for the owner, the consideration for\nsuch construction being the transfer of undivide share in\nland to the builder and grant of permission to the builder\nto construct two or more floors. Apart from consideration\nflowing from the land owner to the builder in the form of\nsale of undivided share in the land and permission to\nconstruct and sell other floors of the building is to adjust\nthe value to the extent of land to be transferred to the\nbuilder, the important aspect is the availment of services\nof the builder by the land owner for house construction for\na consideration. To that extent, the land owner would be a\nconsumer and the builder to be a service provider.\n\n80.\nIn\nHome Solution\ncase, the point for consideration\nbefore the Apex Court was whether the\nFinance Act, 1994\n\nenvisages the levy of Service tax on letting out/renting out\nof immovable property per se. The Apex Court after\nreferring to various relevant provisions of the said Act as\nwell as taking into consideration the various reported\ndecisions including\nKalyan Mandapam Association\ncase\nheld that the Supreme Court in\nKalyan Mandapam\ncase\nhad held that the service of a Mandap Keeper does not\ninvolve transfer of movable property nor does it involve a\ntransfer of any immovable property of any kind known to\nlaw either under the\nTransfer of Property Act\nor otherwise\nand therefore, the said activity could be only classified as a\nservice.\n\nIt was further held that the observation of the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nSupreme Court in\nKalyan Mandapal\ncase that the utilization\nof the premises as a mandap by itself would constitute a\nservice was required to be distinguished from the kind of\nactivity that is contemplated under\nSection 65(105)(zzzz)\n\nof the said Act. The case of a mandap and service provided\nby Mandap Keeper would not be applicable to a case of\nrenting of immovable property simplicitor. It was further\nheld that the Service tax is a value added tax. It is a tax\non value addition provided by a service provider. It is,\ntherefore, obvious that it must have connection with a\nservice and there must be some value addition by that\nservice. If there is no value addition then there is no\nservice. In so far as renting of immovable property for use\nin the course of or furtherance of the business or\ncommerce is concerned by itself does not entail any value\naddition and, therefore, cannot be regarded as a service.\n\n81. In Association of Leasing & Financial Service\nCompanies the Apex Court was dealing with the matter of\nan association of lending and financial companies.\nThe\nFinance Act\nprovided for levy of Service tax for banking\nand other financial services.\nSection 137\nof the Finance\nAct, 2001 substituted\nSection 65\nwhich defined banking\nand other financial services. Subsequently the definition\nunderwent changes which were introduced by way of\n\nSection 90\nof the Finance Act, 2004 and\nSection 135\nof the\nFinance Act, 2007. The appellant filed writ petition in the\nHigh Court challenging the levy of Service tax imposed by\n\nSection 65(12)(a)(i)\nof the said Act. During the pendency\nof the writ petition, the government issued a Notification\ndated 1-3-2006 exempting 90% of the amount payable\nunder higher purchase/equipment leasing agreements\nfrom Service tax on the ground that the said 90%\nrepresented interest income earned by the service\nprovider. By virtue of the amended definition of the\nexpression banking and other financial services, the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\ntransactions in the nature of financial leasing, equipment\nleasing and hire-purchase had been sought to be brought\nwithin the Service tax net. The Apex court after taking\nnote of various provisions of law observed that the Reserve\nBank of India was constituted under\nRBI Act, 1934\ninter\nalia to regulate the country's monetary system.\nChapter\nIII-B of the RBI Act\ndeals with the provision relating to\nnon-banking financial companies and financial institutions.\nSection 45-I(c ) of\nRBI Act\ntreats financing as an activity.\nThose activities are regulated by Reserve Bank of India.\nThe expression financial institution means any non banking\ninstitution which carries on as its business and activity\ninter alia of financing, whether by way of making loans or\nadvances or otherwise. Under notification dated 2-1-1998,\nthe deposit taking activities of non-banking financial\ncompanies were also sought to be regulated. Similarly,\nunder RBI guidelines dealing with the accounting for\ninvestments, the non-banking financial companies having\nnot less than 60% of the total assets in lease and higher\npurchase and deriving not less than 60% of their total\nincome from such activities can be classified as higher\npurchase/equipment leasing companies. The Apex Court\nfurther observed that the significance of the said circulars\nand guidelines is to show that the activities undertaken by\nnon-banking financial companies of equipment leasing and\nhire-purchase finance are facilities extended by non-\nbanking financial companies to their customers. They are\nfinancial services rendered by such non-banking financial\ncompanies to their customers and they fall within the\nmeaning of the words banking and other financial services\nwhich were sought to be brought within the Service tax net\nunder\nSection 66\nof the said Act. Referring to the Sale of\nGoods Act and commentary of the said statute by Mulla,\nthe Apex Court specifically observed that :\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n―a common method of selling goods is by means of an\nagreement commonly known as a hire-purchase\nagreement which is more aptly described as a hiring\nagreement coupled with an option or purchase, i.e. To say\nthat the owner lets out the chattel on higher and\nundertakes to sell it to the hirer on his making certain\nnumber of payments. If that is the real effect of the\nagreement there is no contract of sale until the hirer has\nmade the required number of payments and he remains a\nbailee till then. But some so-called hire-purchase\nagreements are in reality contracts to purchase, the price\nto be paid by installments and in those cases the contract\nis a contract of sale and not of hiring. It depends on the\nterms of the contract whether it is to be regarded as a\ncontract of hiring or a contract of sale‖.\n\n82. The Apex Court further observed that in All India\nFederation of Tax Practitioners' the Apex Court had\nexplained the concept of Service tax and had held that the\nService tax is a valued added tax which in turn is\ndestination based consumption tax in the sense that it is\nlevied on commercial activities and it is not a charge on\nthe business but on the consumer. And that the Service\ntax is an economic concept based on the principle of\nequivalence in a sense that consumption of goods and\nconsumption of services are similar as they both satisfy\nhuman needs. It was further held by the Apex Court that\n:-\n\n―Today with the technological advancement there is a very\nthin line which divides a ―sale‖ from ―service‖. That,\napplying the principle of equivalence, there is no difference\nbetween production or manufacture of saleable goods and\nproduction of marketable/saleable services in the form of\nan activity undertaken by the service provider for\nconsideration, which correspondingly stands consumed by\nthe service receiver. It is this principle of equivalence\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nwhich inbuilt into the concept of Service tax under the\n\nFinance Act, 1994\n. That Service tax is, therefore, a tax on\nan activity. That, Service tax is a value added tax. The\nvalue addition is on account of the activity which provides\nvalue addition, for example, an activity undertaken by a\nChartered Accountant or a broker is an activity undertaken\nby him based on his performance and skill. This is from the\npoint of view of the professional. However, from the point\nof view of his client, the Chartered Accountant/broker is\nhis service provider. The value addition comes in on\naccount of the activity undertaken by the professional like\ntax planning, advising, consultation etc. It gives value\naddition to the goods manufactured or produced or sold.\nThus, Service tax is imposed every time service is\nrendered to the customer/client‖.\n\nThe Apex\nCourt further held\nthat ―every tax may be levied\non an object or on the event of taxation. Service tax is,\nthus, a tax on activity whereas sales tax is a tax on sale of\na thing or goods‖.\n\nHaving held so, it was also ruled that :\n\n―A contract of sale is different from an agreement to sell\nand unlike other contracts, operates by itself and without\ndelivery to transfer the property in the goods sold. The\nword ―sale‖ connotes both a contract and a conveyance or\ntransfer of property. The law relating to building contracts\nwas well known when Gannon Dunkerlay's case was\ndecided and under that law the supply of goods as part of\nthe works contract was not a sale. Thus, the essential\ningredients of the ―sale‖ are agreement to sell movables\nfor a price and property passing therein pursuant to an\nagreement‖.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n83. Referring to the facts of the case of Association of\nLeasing & Financial Service Companies, the Apex Court\nheld that :\n\n―the impugned levy relates to or is with respect to the\nparticular topic of ―banking and other financial services‖\nwhich includes within it one of the several enumerated\nservices, viz, financial leasing services. These include long\ntime financing by banks and other financial institutions\n(including NBFCs). These are services rendered to their\ncustomers which comes within the meaning of the\nexpression ―taxable services‖ as defined in\nSection\n65(105)(zm)\n. The taxable event under the impugned law\nis the rendition of service. The impugned tax is not on\nmaterial or sale. It is on activity/service rendered by the\nservice provider to its customer. Equipment Leasing/Hire-\nPurchase finance are long term financing activities\nrendered. Such amount is credited to the capital account of\nthe lessor/hire-purchase service provider. It is the\ninterest/finance charge which is treated as income or\nrevenue and which is credited to the revenue account,\nSuch interest or finance charges together with the lease\nmanagement fee/processing fee/documentation charges\nare treated as considerations for the services rendered and\naccordingly they constitute the value of taxable services on\nwhich Service tax is made payable‖.\n\n84. In Bharat Sanchar Nigam's case the matter related to\nthe state Legislative competency to levy sale tax on the\ntransaction, by which mobile phone connections are\nenjoyed by the customers, under Entry 54 List-II of the\nSeventh Schedule to the Constitution. After taking note of\nthe consensus amongst the parties on the point that the\n―goods‖ element in telecommunication were the\nelectromagnetic waves by which data generated by the\nsubscriber was transmitted to the desired destination and\nproceeding on the basis that incorporeal rights may be\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n―goods‖ for the purpose of levying sale tax, it was held\nthat electromagnetic waves are neither abstracted nor are\nthey consumed in the sense that they are not extinguished\nby their user. They are not delivered, stored or possessed.\nNor are they marketable. They are merely the medium of\ncommunication, what is transmitted is not an\nelectromagnetic wave but the signal through such means.\nThe signals are generated by the subscribers themselves.\nIn telecommunication what is transmitted is the message\nby means of the telegraph. No part of the telegraph itself\nis transferable or deliverable to the subscribers. It was\nruled that ―the electromagnetic waves are not ‗goods'\nwithin the meaning of the word either in\nArticle 366(12)\nor\nin the State Legislation‖. It was further observed that ―it is\nnot in the circumstances necessary for us to determine\nwhether telephone system including the telephone\nexchange was not goods but immovable property as\ncontended by some of the petitioners‖. It was further held\nthat ―a telephone service is nothing but a service. There is\nno sale element apart from obvious one relating to the\nhand set if any. That and any other accessory supplied by\nthe service provider in our opinion remain to be taxed\nunder the State Sales Tax Laws‖. It was also held that the\nnature of the transaction involved in providing the\ntelephone connection may be a composite contract of\nservice and sale. It is possible for the State to tax the sale\nelement provided there is a discernible sale and only to the\nextent relatable to such sale.\n\n85. In Gannon Dunkerley case it was held that if there is\nan instrument of contract which may be composite in form\nin any case other than the exceptions in\nArticle 366(29A)\n,\nunless the transaction in truth represents two distinct and\nseparate contracts and is discernible as such, then the\nState would not have the power to separate the agreement\nto sell from the agreement to render service and impose\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nthe tax on sale. However, the said finding was preceded by\nthe reasoning that ―we are concerned herewith a building\ncontract, and in the case of such a contract, the theory\nthat it can be broken up into its component parts and as\nregards one of them it can be said that there is a sale\nmust fail both on the grounds that there is no agreement\nto sell materials as such, and that property in them does\nnot pose as movables‖.\n\n86. Plain reading of the decisions of the Apex Court would\ndisclose that the Apex Court clearly brought out the\ndifference between sale and services. Besides it has been\nclearly clarified that the taxable event under the said Act is\nthe rendition of service. It is on the activity conducted or\nservice rendered by the service provider to its customer\nthat attracts the provisions of the said Act. The tax under\nthe said Act cannot be levied on materials or on sale.\nUndoubtedly, in case of sale, if any services are rendered\nin the nature of processing fee or documentation charges,\netc., that could form part of the services rendered and\nmay constitute the value of taxable service on which the\nService tax may be leviable. In other words, sale, by itself,\nof immovable property, either developed or undeveloped,\nor even alongwith construction therein, would not amount\nto rendering any service, either taxable or otherwise. But\nat the same time, any service rendered in the form of\ndocumentation or the like, certainly the same could\namount to rendering service and would attract the\nprovisions of the said Act. It is, therefore, necessary for\nthe department before classifying an activity of service\nprovider to be taxable service, to establish the factum of\nrendering of any such service by the service recipient to\nothers in the course of sale of the immovable property by\nsuch service recipient, and only then it could be said that\nthe service provider had provided Business Auxiliary\nService by promoting or marketing such services of the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nservice recipient. Needless to say that to establish such\nfacts, it is primarily necessary to have a clear charge in\nthat regard with the factual foundation in the show cause\nnotice to give proper and fair opportunity to the assessee\nto meet the case of the department and thereupon to\nestablish such charge in the course of adjudication\nproceedings. As far as the case in hand is concerned, as\nalready seen above in relation to the service aspect is\nconcerned, the allegation or charge in that regard relates\nto the sale of immovable properties or the developed\nproperties or the constructed project by Sahara\nCorporation. It does not relate to any service rendered by\nSahara Corporation to others in relation to the sale of such\nproperties or projects.‖\n\n4.20 From the observations made in the said decision it is quite\nevident that the issue under consideration of the tribunal in this\ncase was making distinction between sale and service. Tribunal\nhas in the above decision nowhere concluded that the service\nrendered by the service recipient should have been taxable\nservice. Similarly we do not find any such finding recorded by\nthe tribunal in the case of Steria also. Therefore the submissions\nmade by the appellant on the basis of these decisions cannot be\naccepted. We have referred to the memorandum of\nunderstanding, balance sheet and other documents in the earlier\npart of our order, and have concluded that the client of appellant\nwas engaged in the business of providing services to his clients.\n\n4.21 Appellant has relied upon the decision of Federal Bank\nLimited [2008 (10) STR 320 (T-Bang)] and the decision in case\nof Atlas Documentary Facilitators Company (P) Ltd [2017 (50)\nSTR 22 (T-Mum)] to argue that for the purpose of classifying the\nservices as ancillary or incidental service as per clause (iv) for\nthe period prior to 09.10.2004 the services should fall in one of\nthe principal clause i.e. (i), (ii) or (iii). These decisions also do\nnot support the case of the appellant. In case of Federal bank\nthe observations made by the tribunal were in respect of the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\namended\nSection 65 (19)\nas is evident from the decision of\nHon‟ble Kerala High Court as reported at [2013 (29) S.T.R. 554\n(Ker.)] and the decision of Hon‟ble Apex Court as reported at\n[2016 (42) S.T.R. 418 (S.C.)] affirming the above decision of\nTribunal. We do not dispute that post the amendments made\nfrom 09.10.2004, the sub clause (vii) linked the incidental and\nancillary activities with the activities specified in clause (i) to\n\n(vi).\n\n4.22 With effect from 09.10.2004\nSection 65 (19)\nwas amended\nsubstituting the existing section by new section wherein sub\nclauses (iv) was replaced by (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) which are\nreproduced below:\n\n(iv) procurement of goods or services, which are inputs\nfor the client; or\n\n(v) production of goods on behalf of the client; or\n\n(vi) provision of service on behalf of the client; or\n\n(vii) a service incidental or auxiliary to any activity\nspecified in sub-clauses (i) to (vi), such as billing,\nissue or collection or recovery of cheques, payments,\nmaintenance of accounts and remittances, inventory\nmanagement, evaluation or development of\nprospective customer or vendor, public relation\nservices, management or supervision;\n\nImpugned order holds that the services provided by the\nappellant to his client are covered by (vi). From the terms of the\nMemorandum of understanding referred earlier it is evident that\nthe appellant is providing the service of accepting deposit on the\nbehalf of his client. We have also held that the activity of\naccepting deposits is a service. From the perusal of the definition\nof the clauses as above we find that the word used in clauses\n\n(iv), (v) (vi) and (vii) is \"service‟ and not taxable service. It is\nsettled principle in law that the taxing statute need to be\nconsidered on the basis of the words used by the legislature and\nthere is no room for intendment etc. reliance is placed on the\ndecisions of the Hon‟ble apex Court in the case of Dilip Kumar &\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nCompany [2019 (361) ELT 577 (SC)] wherein following has\nbeen held:\n\n18. It is well accepted that a statute must be construed\naccording to the intention of the Legislature and the Courts\nshould act upon the true intention of the legislation while\napplying law and while interpreting law. If a statutory\nprovision is open to more than one meaning, the Court has\nto choose the interpretation which represents the intention\nof the Legislature.\nIn this connection, the following\nobservations made by this Court in\nDistrict Mining Officer\nv. Tata Iron and Steel Co.\n, (2001) 7 SCC 358, may be\nnoticed :\n\n―... A statute is an edict of the Legislature and in construing\na statute, it is necessary, to seek the intention of its\nmaker. A statute has to be construed according to the\nintent of them that make it and the duty of the Court is to\nact upon the true intention of the Legislature. If a\nstatutory provision is open to more than one interpretation\nthe Court has to choose that interpretation which\nrepresents the true intention of the Legislature. This task\nvery often raises the difficulties because of various\nreasons, inasmuch as the words used may not be scientific\nsymbols having any precise or definite meaning and the\nlanguage may be an imperfect medium to convey one's\nthought or that the assembly of Legislatures consisting of\npersons of various shades of opinion purport to convey a\nmeaning which may be obscure. It is impossible even for\nthe most imaginative Legislature to forestall exhaustively\nsituations and circumstances that may emerge after\nenacting a statute where its application may be called for.\nNonetheless, the function of the Courts is only to expound\nand not to legislate. Legislation in a modern State is\nactuated with some policy to curb some public evil or to\neffectuate some public benefit. The legislation is primarily\ndirected to the problems before the Legislature based on\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\ninformation derived from past and present experience. It\nmay also be designed by use of general words to cover\nsimilar problems arising in future. But, from the very\nnature of things, it is impossible to anticipate fully the\nvaried situations arising in future in which the application\nof the legislation in hand may be called for, and, words\nchosen to communicate such indefinite referents are bound\nto be in many cases lacking in clarity and precision and\nthus giving rise to controversial questions of construction.\nThe process of construction combines both literal and\npurposive approaches. In other words the legislative\nintention, i.e., the true or legal meaning of an enactment\nis derived by considering the meaning of the words used in\nthe enactment in the light of any discernible purpose or\nobject which comprehends the mischief and its remedy to\nwhich the enactment is directed...‖\n\n19. The well-settled principle is that when the words in a\nstatute are clear, plain and unambiguous and only one\nmeaning can be inferred, the Courts are bound to give\neffect to the said meaning irrespective of consequences. If\nthe words in the statute are plain and unambiguous, it\nbecomes necessary to expound those words in their\nnatural and ordinary sense. The words used declare the\nintention of the Legislature.\nIn\nKanai Lal Sur v. Paramnidhi\nSadhukhan\n, AIR 1957 SC 907, it was held that if the words\nused are capable of one construction only then it would not\nbe open to the Courts to adopt any other hypothetical\nconstruction on the ground that such construction is more\nconsistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act.\n\n20. In applying rule of plain meaning any hardship and\ninconvenience cannot be the basis to alter the meaning to\nthe language employed by the legislation. This is especially\nso in fiscal statutes and penal statutes. Nevertheless, if the\nplain language results in absurdity, the Court is entitled to\ndetermine the meaning of the word in the context in which\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nit is used keeping in view the legislative purpose [\nAssistant\nCommissioner, Gadag Sub-Division, Gadag v. Mathapathi\nBasavannewwa\n, 1995 (6) SCC 355]. Not only that, if the\nplain construction leads to anomaly and absurdity, the\nCourt having regard to the hardship and consequences\nthat flow from such a provision can even explain the true\nintention of the legislation. Having observed general\nprinciples applicable to statutory interpretation, it is now\ntime to consider rules of interpretation with respect to\ntaxation.\n\n21. In construing penal statutes and taxation statutes,\nthe Court has to apply strict rule of interpretation. The\npenal statute which tends to deprive a person of right to\nlife and liberty has to be given strict interpretation or else\nmany innocent might become victims of discretionary\ndecision-making. Insofar as taxation statutes are\nconcerned,\nArticle 265\nof the Constitution [265. Taxes not\nto be imposed save by authority of law - No tax shall be\nlevied or collected except by authority of law.] prohibits\nthe State from extracting tax from the citizens without\nauthority of law. It is axiomatic that taxation statute has to\nbe interpreted strictly because State cannot at their whims\nand fancies burden the citizens without authority of law. In\nother words, when competent Legislature mandates taxing\ncertain persons/certain objects in certain circumstances, it\ncannot be expanded/interpreted to include those, which\nwere not intended by the Legislature.\n\n22. At the outset, we must clarify the position of ‗plain\nmeaning rule or clear and unambiguous rule' with respect\nof tax law. ‗The plain meaning rule' suggests that when the\nlanguage in the statute is plain and unambiguous, the\nCourt has to read and understand the plain language as\nsuch, and there is no scope for any interpretation. This\nsalutary maxim flows from the phrase ―cum inverbis nulla\nambiguitas est, non debet admitti voluntatis quaestio‖.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nFollowing such maxim, the Courts sometimes have made\nstrict interpretation subordinate to the plain meaning rule\n[Mangalore Chemicals case (Infra para 37).], though strict\ninterpretation is used in the precise sense. To say that\nstrict interpretation involves plain reading of the statute\nand to say that one has to utilize strict interpretation in the\nevent of ambiguity is self-contradictory.\n\n23. Next, we may consider the meaning and scope of\n‗strict interpretation', as evolved in Indian law and how the\nhigher Courts have made a distinction while interpreting a\ntaxation statute on one hand and tax exemption\nnotification on the other. In Black's Law Dictionary (10th\nEdn.) ‗strict interpretation' is described as under :\n\nStrict interpretation. (16c) 1. An interpretation according\nto the narrowest, most literal meaning of the words\nwithout regard for context and other permissible\nmeanings. 2. An interpretation according to what the\ninterpreter narrowly believes to have been the specific\nintentions or understandings of the text's authors or\nratifiers, and no more. - Also termed (in senses 1 & 2)\nstrict construction, literal interpretation; literal\nconstruction; restricted interpretation; interpretatio stricta;\ninterpretatio restricta; interpretatio verbalis. 3. The\nphilosophy underlying strict interpretation of statutes. -\nAlso termed as close interpretation; interpretatio\nrestrictive.\n\nSee strict constructionism under constructionism. Cf. large\ninterpretation; liberal interpretation (2).\n\n―Strict construction of a statute is that which refuses to\nexpand the law by implications or equitable considerations,\nbut confines its operation to cases which are clearly within\nthe letter of the statute, as well as within its spirit or\nreason, not so as to defeat the manifest purpose of the\nlegislature, but so as to resolve all reasonable doubts\nagainst the applicability of the statute to the particular\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\ncase.' Wiliam M. Lile et al., Brief Making and the use of\nLaw Books 343 (Roger W. Cooley & Charles Lesly Ames\neds., 3d ed. 1914).\n\n―Strict interpretation is an equivocal expression, for it\nmeans either literal or narrow. When a provision is\nambiguous, one of its meaning may be wider than the\nother, and the strict (i.e., narrow) sense is not necessarily\nthe strict (i.e., literal) sense.‖ John Salmond,\nJurisprudence 171 n. (t) (Glanville L. Williams ed., 10th\ned. 1947).\n\n24. As contended by Ms. Pinky Anand, Learned Additional\nSolicitor General, the principle of literal interpretation and\nthe principle of strict interpretation are sometimes used\ninterchangeably. This principle, however, may not be\nsustainable in all contexts and situations. There is certainly\nscope to sustain an argument that all cases of literal\ninterpretation would involve strict rule of interpretation,\nbut strict rule may not necessarily involve the former,\nespecially in the area of taxation. The decision of this Court\nin\nPunjab Land Development and Reclamation Corporation\nLtd., Chandigarh v. Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt\nChandigarh and Ors., (1990) 3 SCC 682, made the said\ndistinction, and explained the literal rule-\n\n―The literal rules of construction require the wording of the\nAct to be construed according to its literal and grammatical\nmeaning whatever the result may be. Unless otherwise\nprovided, the same word must normally be construed\nthroughout the Act in the same sense, and in the case of\nold statutes regard must be had to its contemporary\nmeaning if there has been no change with the passage of\ntime.‖\n\nThat strict interpretation does not encompass strict -\nliteralism into its fold. It may be relevant to note that\nsimply juxtaposing ‗strict interpretation' with literal rule'\nwould result in ignoring an important aspect that is\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n‗apparent legislative intent'. We are alive to the fact that\nthere may be overlapping in some cases between the\naforesaid two rules. With certainty, we can observe that,\n‗strict interpretation' does not encompass such literalism,\nwhich lead to absurdity and go against the legislative\nintent. As noted above, if literalism is at the far end of the\nspectrum, wherein it accepts no implications or inferences,\nthen ‗strict interpretation' can be implied to accept some\nform of essential inferences which literal rule may not\naccept.\n\n25. We are not suggesting that literal rule de hors the\nstrict interpretation nor one should ignore to ascertain the\ninterplay between ‗strict interpretation' and ‗literal\ninterpretation'. We may reiterate at the cost of repetition\nthat strict interpretation of a statute certainly involves\nliteral or plain meaning test. The other tools of\ninterpretation, namely contextual or purposive\ninterpretation cannot be applied nor any resort be made to\nlook to other supporting material, especially in taxation\nstatutes. Indeed, it is well-settled that in a taxation\nstatute, there is no room for any intendment; that regard\nmust be had to the clear meaning of the words and that\nthe matter should be governed wholly by the language of\nthe notification. Equity has no place in interpretation of a\ntax statute. Strictly one has to look to the language used;\nthere is no room for searching intendment nor drawing any\npresumption. Furthermore, nothing has to be read into nor\nshould anything be implied other than essential inferences\nwhile considering a taxation statute.\n\n26. Justice G.P. Singh, in his treatise ‗Principles of\nStatutory Interpretation' (14th ed. 2016 p.-879) after\nreferring to Re, Micklethwait, (1885) 11 Ex 452; Partington\nv. A.G., (1869) LR 4 HL 100;\nRajasthan Rajya Sahakari\nSpinning & Ginning Mills Federation Ltd. v. Deputy CIT,\nJaipur\n, (2014) 11 SCC 672, State Bank of Travancore v.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax, (1986) 2 SCC 11 and Cape\nBrandy Syndicate v. IRC, (1921) 1 KB 64, summed up the\nlaw in the following manner -\n\n―A taxing statute is to be strictly construed. The well-\nestablished rule in the familiar words of LORD\nWENSLEYDALE, reaffirmed by LORD HALSBURY AND LORD\nSIMONDS, means : ‗The subject is not to be taxed without\nclear words for that purpose : and also that every Act of\nParliament must be read according to the natural\nconstruction of its words. In a classic passage LORD\nCAIRNS stated the principle thus : ―If the person sought to\nbe taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be\ntaxed, however great the hardship may appear to the\njudicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the Crown\nseeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within\nthe letter of the law, the subject is free, however\napparently within the spirit of law the case might otherwise\nappear to be. In other words, if there be admissible in any\nstatute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly,\nsuch a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute\nwhere you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.\nVISCOUNT SIMON quoted with approval a passage from\nROWLATT, J. expressing the principle in the following\nwords : ―In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is\nclearly said. This is no room for any intendment. There is\nno equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to tax.\nNothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can\nonly look fairly at the language used.‖\n\nIt was further observed :\n\n―In all tax matters one has to interpret the taxation statute\nstrictly. Simply because one class of legal entities is given\na benefit which is specifically stated in the Act, does not\nmean that the benefit can be extended to legal entities not\nreferred to in the Act as there is no equity in matters of\ntaxation....‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nYet again, it was observed :\n\n―It may thus be taken as a maxim of tax law, which\nalthough not to be overstressed ought not to be forgotten\nthat, ―the subject is not to be taxed unless the words of\nthe taxing statute unambiguously impose the tax on him‖,\n[Russel v. Scott, (1948) 2 All ER 1]. The proper course in\nconstruing revenue Acts is to give a fair and reasonable\nconstruction to their language without leaning to one side\nor the other but keeping in mind that no tax can be\nimposed without words clearly showing an intention to lay\nthe burden and that equitable construction of the words is\nnot permissible [Ormond Investment Co. v. Betts, (1928)\nAC 143]. Considerations of hardship, injustice or anomalies\ndo not play any useful role in construing taxing statutes\nunless there be some real ambiguity [Mapp v. Oram,\n(1969) 3 All ER 215]. It has also been said that if taxing\nprovision is ―so wanting in clarity that no meaning is\nreasonably clear, the Courts will be unable to regard it as\nof any effect [IRC v. Ross and Coutler, (1948) 1 All ER\n616].‖\n\nFurther elaborating on this aspect, the Learned author\nstated as follows :\n\n―Therefore, if the words used are ambiguous and\nreasonable open to two interpretations benefit of\ninterpretation is given to the subject [Express Mill v.\nMunicipal Committee, Wardha, AIR 1958 SC 341].\nIf the\nLegislature fails to express itself clearly and the taxpayer\nescapes by not being brought within the letter of the law,\nno question of unjustness as such arises [\nCIT v. Jalgaon\nElectric Supply Co.\n, AIR 1960 SC 1182].\n\nBut equitable\nconsiderations are not relevant in construing a taxing\nstatute, [\nCIT, W.B. v. Central India Industries\n, AIR 1972\nSC 397], and similarly logic or reason cannot be of much\navail in interpreting a taxing statute [\nAzam Jha v.\nExpenditure Tax Officer, Hyderabad\n, AIR 1972 SC 2319].\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nIt is well-settled that in the field of taxation, hardship or\nequity has no role to play in determining eligibility to tax\nand it is for the Legislature to determine the same [\nKapil\nMohan v. Commr. of Income Tax, Delhi\n, AIR 1999 SC\n573].\n\nSimilarly, hardship or equity is not relevant in\ninterpreting provisions imposing stamp duty, which is a\ntax, and the Court should not concern itself with the\nintention of the Legislature when the language expressing\nsuch intention is plain and unambiguous [\nState of Madhya\nPradesh v. Rakesh Kohli & Anr.\n, (2012) 6 SCC 312].\n\nBut\njust as reliance upon equity does not avail an assesse, so it\ndoes not avail the Revenue.‖\n\nThe passages extracted above, were quoted with approval\nby this Court in at least two decisions being\nCommissioner\nof Income Tax v. Kasturi Sons Ltd.\n, (\n1999) 3 SCC 346 and\nState of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Limited\n,\n(2004) 10 SCC 201 [hereinafter referred as\n‗Kesoram\nIndustries\ncase' for brevity]. In the later decision, a Bench\nof seven-Judges, after citing the above passage from\nJustice G.P. Singh's treatise, summed up the following\nprinciples applicable to the interpretation of a taxing\nstatute :\n\n―(i) In interpreting a taxing statute, equitable\nconsiderations are entirely out of place. A taxing statute\ncannot be interpreted on any presumption or assumption.\nA taxing statute has to be interpreted in the light of what\nis clearly expressed : it cannot imply anything which is not\nexpressed : it cannot import provisions in the statute so as\nto supply any deficiency : (ii) Before taxing any person, it\nmust be shown that he falls within the ambit of the\ncharging section by clear words used in the section; and\n\n(iii) If the words are ambiguous and open to two\ninterpretations, the benefit of interpretation is given to the\nsubject and there is nothing unjust in a taxpayer escaping\nif the letter of the law fails to catch him on account of\nLegislature's failure to express itself clearly‖.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.23 Relying on the decision of Hon‟ble Supreme Court as\n\nreferred above\nHon‟ble Madras High Court has in the case of\nPremier Garment Process [2022 (67) G.S.T.L. 514 (Mad.)] held\nas follows:\n\n9. Prior to the aforesaid period, the appellant was liable\nto pay tax service provider as ―Business Auxiliary Service‖\nas defined under\nSection 65(19)\nof the Finance Act, 1994,\nwhich reads as under:\n\n―(iii) for clause (19) the following clauses shall be\nsubstituted, namely :-\n\n(19) ―business auxiliary service‖ means any service in\nrelation to -\n\n(i) ......‖\n\n10. The appellant was liable to pay tax, as the service\nprovided by the appellant squarely falls within the ambit of\nClause (iii) of\nSection 65(19)\nof Finance Act, 1994, which\nreads as under :\n\n(iii) any customer care service provided on behalf of the\nclient.\n\n11. For the period after 1-7-2012, the service provided\nby the appellant fall within the definition of ‗service' as\nunder\nSection 65(b)(44)\nof the Finance Act, 1994 w.e.f. 1-\n7-2012, which reads as follows :\n\n.......\n\n12. The reliance placed on\nSection 99\nof the Finance Act,\n2013 by the appellant in this appeal, at this stage, is of no\nrelevance as it applies only to taxable service\nprovided by the Indian Railways. The service provided\nby the appellant to the Railways cannot be construed as\nthe service provided by the Railways. What is provided by\nthe appellant is the service of supply of bed rolls alone for\nthe passengers travelling in AC compartments. Therefore,\nthe appellant cannot claim any exemption in terms of the\naforesaid provisions of the\nFinance Act, 2013\n. That apart,\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nwhile claiming exemption, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nUnion of India v. Wood Papers Ltd.\n1991 taxmann.com 77\n(SC) = 1990 (47) E.L.T. 500 (S.C.) has held as under :\n\n―....Literally exemption is freedom from liability, tax or\nduty. Fiscally, it may assume varying shapes, specially, in\na growing economy. For instance tax holiday to new units,\nconcessional rate of tax to goods or persons for limited\nperiod or with the specific objective etc. That is why its\nconstruction, unlike charging provision, has to be tested on\ndifferent touchstone. In fact, an exemption provision is like\nan exception and on normal principle of construction or\ninterpretation of statutes it is construed strictly either\nbecause of legislative intention or on economic justification\nof inequitable burden or progressive approach of fiscal\nprovisions intended to augment State revenue. But once\nexception or exemption becomes applicable no rule or\nprinciples requires it to be construed strictly. Truly\nspeaking liberal and strict construction of an exemption\nprovision are to be invoked at different stages of\ninterpreting it. When the question is whether a subject falls\nin the notification or in the exemption clause then it being\nin nature of exception is to be construed strictly and\nagainst the subject, but once ambiguity or doubt about\napplicability is lifted and the subject falls in the notification\nthen full play should be given to it and it calls for a wider\nand liberal construction......‖\n\n13. This view has been followed repeatedly by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court and recently in\nCommissioner of\nCustoms (Import), Mumbai v. Dilip Kumar & Company\n\n[2018 (361) E.L.T. 577 (S.C.)], the law has been\nsummarised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as follows :\n\n―(1) Exemption notification should be interpreted\nstrictly; the burden of proving applicability would be\non the assessee to show that his case comes within\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nthe parameters of the exemption clause or\nexemption notification.\n\n(2) When there is ambiguity in exemption\nnotification which is subject to strict interpretation,\nthe benefit of such ambiguity cannot be claimed by\nthe subject/assessee and it must be interpreted in\nfavour of the revenue.\n\n(3) The ratio in Sun Export case is not correct and\nall the decisions which took similar view as in Sun\nExport Case stands overruled.‖\n\n14. Once the language in taxing statute is clear, there is\nno scope in interpreting the same as the tax provisions has\nto be read as it is and nothing is to be intended. In this\nconnection, the decision of the Privy Council in Cape\nBrandy Syndicate v. Inland Revenue Commissioner\n[(1921) 1KB 64] wherein it is held as follows :\n\n―In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly\nsaid. There is no room for any intendment. There is no\nequity about a tax. There is no presumption as to tax.\nNothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can\nonly took fairly at the language used.‖\n\n15. This view has also been followed by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court repeatedly in several cases dealing with\ntaxing enactment. Therefore, we are not inclined to\ninterfere with the order passed by the Central Excise\nService Tax Appellate Tribunal. Accordingly, these Civil\nMiscellaneous Appeals are dismissed. We, however, give\nliberty to the appellant to work out their remedy in terms\nof\nSection 64A\nof the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.‖\n\n4.24 Thus in view of the discussions as above we hold that the\nservices provided by the Appellant to M/s SIFCL were correctly\nclassifiable under the taxable category of Business Auxiliary\nService as defined by\nSection 65 (19)\nand amended from time to\ntime during the relevant period.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.25 On the issue of reimbursable expenses, adjudicating\nauthority has observed as follows:\n\n―22.5 Reimbursement of Expenses: At the time of hearing\non 31.7.08, the Noticee submitted a copy of various\nclarifications in support of their stand that they should get\nthe benefit of reimbursement. The Noticee has made\nreference to DGST letter F No V/DGST/Misc-7/98/Mumbai\ndt 11th Feb 1999 which states; ―As regards charges billed\nto the client on account of out of pocket expenses which\nare reimbursable on actual basis, such as traveling,\nboarding and lodging expenses is concerned, the same are\nnot subject to service tax. In this respect, the service tax\nassessee may be required by the jurisdictional\nCommissioner of Central Excise to provide documentary\nevidence substantiating his claim for abatement from the\ngross amount received from the client for services\nrendered.\n\nThe noticee has also relied on various clarifications in\nrespect of various services like custom house agent,\nmarket research agency, security agency and manpower\nrecruitment agency in which reimbursement on actual\nbasis is kept out of the service tax net.\n\nHere the principle of keeping reimbursement on actual\nexpenses outside the service tax net is not disputed. But\nas DGST letter, documentary evidence is a must for\nconsidering reimbursement on actual basis to be kept\noutside the service tax net. The Noticee has submitted\ncertificate dt 11.8.2009 by M/s CPS & Company Chartered\nAccountants, that direct expenses incurred by M/s Sahara\nIndia, during the relevant period, has been reimbursed by\nM/s SIFCL. They also submitted some copies of Debit notes\nand details period wise direct expenses and uncertified\ncopy of general ledger of M/s Sahara India for the relevant\nperiod. The Noticee has not submitted any clinching\nevidence as to how these expenses have accrued to be\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nreimbursed by M/s SIFCL nor they have submitted any\ndetailed breakup of said expenses. Thus the documents\nprovided by the Noticee are not sufficient to substantiate\nNoticees claim that the said amount has been received by\nthem as reimbursement on actual basis and hence should\nbe outside the service tax net.‖\n\nFrom the above it is evident that impugned order in no way\ndisputes that reimbursable expenses need to be deducted from\nthe gross amount for determining the taxable value. However\nhave denied the same only for the reason that appellant has\nfailed to provide the documents and evidence in respect of these\nexpenses. We are inclined to accept the submissions made by\nthe appellant relying on the decision of Hon‟ble Delhi High Court\nin the case of Intercontinental Consultants and Technocrats P ltd\n[2012-TIOL-966-HC-ST-Del] and affirmed by the Hon‟ble Apex\nCourt as reported at [2018 (10) GSTL 401 (SC)], subject to\nproduction of documents and evidences in this regard before the\nadjudicating authority for re-determination of the taxable value.\nThus matter to this extent needs to be remanded to the\nadjudicating authority.\n\n4.26 On the claim of CENVAT Credit, Commissioner has\nobserved as follows:\n\n―22.4 Whether CENVAT Credit to the noticee was\nadmissible during the period of demand:\n\nIt has been pleaded by the noticee that in the case\nof confirmation of demand in respect of business Auxiliary\nServices they should be extended benefit of CENVAT\nservice tax paid on input service used in relation to output\nservice provided by them.\n\nIn this connection, for consideration of the plea of\nthe noticee, it is pertinent to examine the relevant\nprovisions of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. Sub Rule 7 of\nRule 4 of the CXENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 which prescribes\nthe condition for allowing Cenvat Credit in respect of\nService provider of output service is as under:\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n―The Cenvat Credit in respect of input services shall be\nallowed, on or after the day which payment is made of the\nvalue of input service and the service tax paid or payable\nas indicated in invoice, bill or as the case may be challan\nreferred to in Rule, 9.‖\n\nIt is seen that the condition prescribed for availment of\nCENVAT by service tax provider in the instant case has not\nbeen fulfilled. As the Noticee has neither obtained\nregistration under service tax nor has submitted relevant\ndocuments as specified under Rule 4 and Rule 9 of the\nCENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, therefore they are not eligible\nto take the benefit of CENVAT credit.\n\nIt is also pertinent to point out that the burden of proof\nthat they are entitled for availment of CENVAT Credit is on\nthe noticee in terms of Rule 9 (5) of the CENVAT Credit\nRules, 2004. In absence of such proof from the Noticee the\nplea cannot be as per Service tax Law. The question at this\nstage is theoretical. CENVAT Credit is governed by various\nstipulations and it is for the assessee to follow the\nprescribed procedure to claim the credit on input services.\n\nIt is seen that during the course of investigations by\nDHGCEI and thereafter during substantial submission of\nreply by the noticee has not brought on records the\ndocuments maintained by them and to the availment of\ninput services under the provisions of ―Business Auxiliary\nServices‖. It is also seen that the noticee has not\nsubmitted any documentary evidences for consideration of\nCENVAT Credit of input services or any other compliance of\nprovisions relating TO Cenvat Credit.\n\nI therefore, hold that CENVAT Credit of input service and\ndocumentary evidences in respect of payment of Service\ntax on input service the compliance of Service tax Rules\nfor availment of Cenvat Credit has not been done. The\nnoticee is not entitled to benefit of CENVAT Credit at this\nstage of proceedings.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nLimitation and Penalties:\n\n4.27 On the issue of limitation and imposition of penalties,\nadjudicating authority has in the impugned order observed as\nfollows:\n\n―22.2.2 The noticee had contended that they had\nenquired vide their letter dt 19.07.03 to Superintendent,\nCentral Range -II, Lal Imli, Kanpur mentioning therein that\nthey had been providing service to M/s SIFCL in promotion\nof their work as an agent. They have pleaded that because\nall the facts had been brought to in the notice of the\ndepartment about their activities and therefore the\nextended period therefore the extended period invoked in\nthe show cause notice was not proper.\n\nI have perused the referred letter dt 19.07.03 by the\nnoticee. It is addressed to Superintendent, Central Range\n\n-II, Lal Imli, Kanpur and signed by Regional Manager of\nM/s Sahara India located at Kanpur. The question of\nrelying of this letter does not arise even if was in fact sent\nto some officer in Kanpur in light of Hon'ble High Court's\njudgment in the case of Commissioner of Customs and\nCentral Excise, Meerut Vs Kushal Fertilizers (P) Ltd [2008\n(229) ELT 652 (Uttarakhand)] wherein it has been held\nthat information given to Inspector of range with regard to\nwhich he had no jurisdiction in the matter, cannot be said\nto information to Office of Assistant Collector I.e. the\nconcerned Central Excise Officer.\n\nIt is seen that the head office of the Noticee was at\nBombay and the Noticee itself is located at Lucknow. The\nNoticee was well in position to write / approach Bombay/\nLucknow Service Tax offices to ascertain the position of the\ntaxable service and its classification. As per the case\nrecord it was not done. Moreover, this fact was not\nbrought to the notice of DGCEI Officers at the time of\ninvestigation. This indicates that the noticee had not\nsupplied the material facts to the department or DGCEI\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nOfficers at the time of investigation. I do not find any\nreason to give any weightage to the submission of the\nnoticee at this belated stage. Accordingly, I conclude that\nthe letter dt 19.07.03 is of no relevance and rather it\nwould support the view taken by the Department that\ninspite of having an idea that service tax is payable, the\nNoticee adopted evasioning tactics to willfully avoid the tax\nand follow the required procedure.\n\n22.2.3 The party has relied upon the following case\nlaws in their defence to plead that the demand was time\nbarred and extended period was not applicable on them.\nThey have cited following judgment in their defence:\n\n(\na) Cosmic Dye Chemical Vs Collector of Central Excise\nBombay\n1995 (75) ELT 721 (SC): ......\n\n(b) CCE Vs Cemphar Drug and Liniments 1989 (40) ELT\n276 (SC) ―....‖\n\n(c) Pushpam Pharmaceuticals Company 1995 (78) ELT\n401 9SC) ―....‖\n\n(\nd) Continental Foundation Jt Venture Vs Commissioner\nof Central Excise Chandigarh\n2007 (216) ELT 177 (SC) ―...‖\n\n(e) Bhayalakshmi Poha Industries ―....‖\n\nThus it is seen that the ratio of the above cases is not\napplicable in the present case.\n\n22.2.4 Under the provisions of\nSection 69\nof FA'94\nany service tax provider providing taxable service and\nliable to pay service tax has to obtain registration from\nthe jurisdictional Superintendent of Central Excise. The\nrelevant provision of the\nFinance Act, 1994\nis as under:\n\n―\nSection 69\n: - Registration\n\n(1) Every person liable to pay the service tax under this\nChapter or the rules made thereunder shall, within such\ntime and in such manner and in such form as may be\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nprescribed, make an application for registration to the\nSuperintendent of Central Excise.‖\n\nIt is admitted fact that the noticee did not obtain\nregistration from the Central Excise Department for which\nthey were statutorily required.\n\n22.2.5 The noticee under the provision of\nSection 70\n\nof the Finance Act was under statutory obligation to file\nservice tax return. The relevant extract of\nSection 70\nis as\nunder:\n\n―\nSection 70\n: - Furnishing of returns:\n\na) Every person liable to pay the service tax shall\nhimself assess the tax due on the services\nprovided by him and shall furnish to the\nSuperintendent of Central Excise, a return in such\nform and in such manner and at such frequency\nand with such late fee not exceeding twenty\nthousand rupees, for delayed furnishing of return,\nas may be prescribed.\n\nIt is evident from the ace records that the noticee had not\nfurnished any return to the Superintendent of Central\nExcise during the relevant period.\n\n22.2.6 It is evident from the Para 20.2.3 and para\n20.2.4 that the noticee did not obtain any registration from\nthe department under the provisions of\nSection 69\nof the\nAct, ibid, did not furnish any return to the department\nunder the provisions for the provision of\nSection 70\nof the\nAct, ibid; they did not pay any Service tax. It simply\nimplies that the noticee did not discharge his statutory\nobligations and liability of payment of service tax under\nService tax law. The contention of the noticee that the\nservice Tax was not paid on bonafide belief that they were\nnot liable to pay service tax is not established. The\nservices provided by the noticee are clearly and\nunambiguously within the purview of the definition of\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n―Business Auxiliary Service‖ as defined in\nSection 65 (19)\n\nof the Finance Act, 1994. Keeping in view the status of the\nnoticee and paraphernalia of the noticee the submission of\nignorance and that of ambiguity in the interpretation of\ndefinition of ―Business Auxiliary service‖ is not acceptable\nfrom the facts of the case on record. The material facts\nwere suppressed by the noticee from the department in as\nmuch as the registration was not taken, returns were not\nfiled and the service tax was not paid and with the clear\nintention to evade it. The noticee deliberately did not\ncomply with the provisions of service tax law with intent to\nevade Service tax due to the Govt. exchequer. The noticee\nhas however obtained registration under business support\nservice on 10.11.06.\n\nI therefore, hold that the noticee consciously\nsuppressed material facts from the Department with intent\nto evade Service Tax by not taking registration and not\nfiling returns as per the Service Tax Law. Furthermore, the\nnoticee did not discharge its statutory obligation of Service\nTax payment. The provision of taxable service and evasion\nof service tax by the noticee was detected by the\nDepartment. After taking into all the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, I hold that the extended period\nfor demand of Service tax under\nSection 73 (1)\nof the\nFinance Act, 1994 is invokable.‖\n\n23. Whether the noticee is liable to Penalty under\n\nSection 76\n,\nand &8 of\nFinance Act, 1994\n.\n\na) The submission of the noticee is that there was\nambiguity regarding the scope of ―Business\nAuxiliary Services‖ during the relevant period as\nthe noticee was not sure whether the services\nprovided by them are taxable in light of discussion\nheld herein before.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nb) The noticee did not obtain any registration under\nthe provisions of FA'94. More so the noticee did\nnot furnish any return to the department.\n\nc) The noticee did not file and discharge service tax\nliability on them under Service Tax law during the\nrelevant period.\n\nd) The noticee deliberately with intent to evade\nservice tax did not supply correct and true\ninformation and suppress material facts during\nthe relevant period from the Department and the\ninvestigating officers of DGCEI.\n\nThe noticee has relied upon the following decisions of\nthe Hon'ble Tribunal in their defence that penalty is not\nimpossible:\n\nIn the instant case, the noticee has never approached\nthe department for taking registration and discharging\nits service tax liability. The noticee by action of omission\nor failure to make a return under\nSection 70\nfor the\nperiod 1.7.03 to 31.7.06 to disclose wholly or truly all\nmaterial facts viz, nature of a service provided by them\nand the gross amount of pay out/ commission received\nby them, necessary for their assessment for the sad\nperiod, the value of taxable service had escaped\nassessment. The noticee did so with intent to evade\npayment of service tax. Thus Noticee has rendered\nthemselves liable to penal action under\nSection 76\n,\nand\nof FA' 94‖.\n\n4.28 The sole reliance for arguing against invocation of the\nextended period of limitation by the appellant in the present case\nis on the letter dated 19.07.2003 2hich the some regional office\nof the appellant has written to some unconcerned range officer.\n\nThe Commissioner has rightly stated that nothing was\ncommunicated to the concerned officers which can be said to be\nthe jurisdictional officers in the matter. Further this letter do not\nestablish any bonafides on the behalf of the appellant as nothing\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nhas been placed on record to show that they had even pursued\nfor the response to the said letter. However this letter clearly\nestablishes that the appellant was aware of the fact that the\nservices provided by them are liable to be taxed under the\ncategory of Business Auxiliary Services but with the intention to\nevade the payment of tax they avoided approaching the\njurisdictional officers, with all the relevant facts. Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court has in the case of Gujarat Industries [2015 (326)\nE.L.T. 625 (S.C.)] held as follows:\n\n\"13. Once, we keep the aforesaid facts in mind, it is difficult to\naccept that the assessee was under bona fide belief that Excise\nduty was not payable and that it was not permissible for the\nDepartment to avail the larger period of limitation by invoking\nproviso to\nSection 11A\nof the Act. All the Authorities below have\nrejected this argument of the assessee. The Tribunal while\nupholding the view of the Commissioner agreed with the reasons\ngiven by the Commissioner in the following manner :\n\n―The Commissioner has also for valid reasons held that the\nextended period of limitation was applicable and that the\nDepartment's record did not show the receipt of any letter\nallegedly written on 28-9-1996. The assessee, dealing with\nseveral similar manufacturing units who paid excise duty on\nidentical processes, and doing job work on their behalf would\nhave obviously known that excise registration was required for\nthe cold rolling mills in its factory for the purpose of\nmanufacturing cold-rolled pattas/pattis. The partner of the\nassessee was fully aware that such activity was dutiable, in view\nof the fact that four out of six units from which the goods were\nreceived by M/s. Gujarat Industries were paying duty on similar\nmanufacturing activity. Thus, the Commissioner is right in\nissuing the show cause notice by invoking the extended period of\nlimitation and also holding that the assessee had connived and\ndeliberately acted in a manner to defraud the Revenue. The\nDivision Bench of this Tribunal in\nIndian Strips v. CCE,\nAhmedabad\n- 2004 (173) E.L.T. 265 took note of the Chapter\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nNote 4 of Chapter 72 for holding that cold-rolling process on flat\nrolled product would amount to manufacture. This decision was\nrendered after considering the decision of Hon. Supreme Court in\nSteel Strips Ltd. - 1995 (77) E.L.T. 248 (S.C.), which was\nrendered prior to the enactment of the said Chapter Note 4\nwhich had the effect of including the process of hardening or\ntempering in relation to flat-rolled products in the definition of\n‗manufacture'.\n\nThe subsequent decision in\nLalit Engineering\nWorks v. CCE, Ahmedabad\ncould not have taken a view contrary\nto the earlier binding decision in\nIndian Strips v. CCE,\nAurangabad\n(supra) is required to be followed in a subsequent\ndecision of the Division Bench. The assessee M/s. Gujarat\nIndustries removed the goods without any cover of excise\ninvoices and the other assessees received the cold-worked goods\nwithout cover of such excise invoices.‖\n\n4.29 In the case of L.R. Brothers Indo Flora Ltd [2020 (373)\nE.L.T. 721 (S.C.)] Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\n\"34. In the fact situation of the present case, the appellant was\nissued a show cause notice mentioning that it had suppressed\nthe DTA sales of cut flowers to evade payment of duty. Had the\nappellant in good faith believed that no duty was payable upon\nthe DTA sales of cut flowers, it would have sought prior approval\nof the Development Commissioner, which it failed to do. Even in\nthe letter seeking ex post facto approval, the appellant claimed\nthat they had not used any imported input such as fertilizer,\nplant growth regulations, etc. in growing flowers sold in DTA,\ndespite having imported green house equipment, raw materials\nlike Live Rose Plants and consumables like planting materials\nand fertilizers. Therefore, it prima facie appeared that\nsuppression by the appellant was ―wilful‖. The burden of proving\nto the contrary rested upon the appellant, which the appellant\nfailed to discharge by failing to establish that the imported inputs\nwere not used in the production of the cut flowers sold in DTA.\n\nIn view thereof, the authorities below have rightly invoked\n\nSection 28\nof the 1962 Act and allied provisions.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.30 In case of Kitply Industries [2011 (264) E.L.T. 481 (S.C.)]\nHon‟ble Supreme Court ahs held as follows:\n\n\"22. Consequently, we propose to look into the first issue in\nthe light of the background facts as stated hereinbefore. The\nspecific case of the appellant is that the respondent having\nmanufactured the excisable goods covered under different\nchapter headings, removed them without payment of proper\nduty of excise and that from the aforesaid action it is explicit\nthat there was an intention on the part of the respondent to\nevade payment of duty particularly when the contract clause\nbetween the respondent and M/s. Adyar Gate Hotel Ltd. clearly\nmentioned that the contractors quoted rate would also include\nexcise duty.\n\n23. Although, the respondent has pleaded that it was done out\nof ignorance, but in our considered opinion there appears to be\nan intention to evade excise duty and contravention of the\nprovisions of the Act. Therefore, proviso of\nSection 11A(i)\nof the\nAct would get attracted to the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case.\n\n24. The cause of action, i.e., date of knowledge could be\nattributed to the appellant in the year 1997 when in compliance\nof the memo issued by the appellant and also the summons\nissued, the hotel furnished its reply setting out the details of the\nwork done by the appellant amounting to Rs. 991.66 lakhs and\nat that stage only the department came to know that the work\norder was to carry out the job for furniture also. A bare perusal\nof the records shows that the aforesaid reply was sent by the\nrespondent on receipt of a letter issued by the Commissioner of\nCentral Excise on 27-2-1997. If the period of limitation of five\nyears is computed from the aforesaid date, the show cause\nnotice having been issued on 15-5-2000, the demand made was\nclearly within the period of limitation as prescribed, which is five\nyears.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.31 In case of Bombay Dyeing & Mfg Co Pvt Ltd [1999 (113)\nELT 331 (T)] following has been held:\n\n―9. Where this situation prevails, the assessee who is in\nthe knowledge that the inputs so received are less than\nthose shown in the covering documents, it is for him to\nvoluntarily take the less credit. Where the assessee is in\nsuch knowledge and where the department have no\nknowledge of the situation, the department can allege\nsuppression of facts. Weighment sheets are not the\ndocuments prescribed in the legislature. The assessee was\nworking under the self removal procedure and therefore,\nthere is no reason or cause for the jurisdictional officer to\nknow about the existence of the weighment sheets and the\nshortages in the weighment of inputs that they indicated.\nIn this situation, we do not see any reason to agree with\nthe submission on limitation.‖\n\n4.32 Similarly tribunal has in case of Tech Mahindra [2015 (38)\nSTR 1200 (T)] has held as follows:\n\n―6.4 As regards the contention raised by the appellant that\nthe appellant in their annual balance sheets provided the\nrelevant information, we have perused the balance sheets\nand the balance sheets do not reflect the payments made\nfor the various transactions separately. It only gives the\ngross amount of the expenditure incurred, in terms of\nforeign currency. From that information it cannot be\ngathered, for what purpose the expenditure was incurred,\nwhether it was for a taxable service or otherwise.\nTherefore, unless the details of the expenditure incurred\nare given, it is not possible to make any conclusion one\nway or the other. It is on record that the appellant had not\nprovided copy of the agreement to the department in\nrespect of the services received from abroad and these\nwere provided only in 2010 when the investigation\ncommenced. Further, the exact details of the payments\nmade in respect of the marketing promotion activities were\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\ngiven to the department for the first time only in January,\n2011 vide letters dated 5-1-2011 and 7-1-2011. The show\ncause notice has been issued on 20-4-2011 and, therefore,\nit cannot be said that the show cause notice is barred by\nlimitation of time.\n\n4.33 In the case of Mehta & Co. [2011 (264) E.L.T. 481 (S.C.)]\nHon‟ble Apex Court held as follows:\n\n―The cause of action, i.e., date of knowledge could be\nattributed to the appellant in the year 1997 when in\ncompliance of the memo issued by the appellant and also\nthe summons issued; the hotel furnished its reply setting\nout the details of the work done by the appellant\namounting to Rs. 991.66 lakhs and at that stage only the\ndepartment came to know that the work order was to carry\nout the job for furniture also. A bare perusal of the records\nshows that the aforesaid reply was sent by the respondent\non receipt of a letter issued by the Commissioner of\nCentral Excise on 27-2-1997. If the period of limitation of\nfive years is computed from the aforesaid date, the show\ncause notice having been issued on 15-5-2000, the\ndemand made was clearly within the period of limitation as\nprescribed, which is five years.‖\n\nIn our considered view, the ratio of the aforesaid decision\nsquarely applies to the facts of the present case. Since the\ncopy of the agreement and relevant information were\nprovided to the department only in 2011 the show cause\nnotice issued in April, 2011 is clearly within the period of\nlimitation and therefore, the demands confirmed as above\nfor the period on or after 18-4-2006 cannot be said to be\ntime-barred at all.‖\n\n4.34 In case of Usha Rectifier Corpn (I) Ltd [2011 (263) E.L.T.\n655 (S.C.)] where appellant had failed to take registration and\ndischarge the duty liablity, Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held as\nfollows:\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n\"12. Submission was also made regarding use of the\nextended period limitation contending inter alia that such\nextended period of limitation could not have been used by\nthe respondent. The aforesaid contention is also found to\nbe without any merit as the appellant has not obtained L-4\nlicence nor they had disclosed the fact of manufacturing of\nthe aforesaid goods to the department. The aforesaid\nknowledge of manufacture came to be acquired by the\ndepartment only subsequently and in view of non-\n\ndisclosure of such information by the appellant and\nsuppression of relevant facts, the extended period of\nlimitation was rightly invoked by the department.‖\n\n4.35 In view of the discussions as above we do not find any\nmerits in the submissions of the appellant that an extended\nperiod should not have been invoked for making this demand.\nThe issue of limitation has to be considered on the facts of case\nin hand and the conduct of the assessee/ appellant. There\ncannot be application of the decisions in determining the issue of\nlimitation on the basis of the law laid down therein ignoring the\nfacts of case in hand. We do not find that decisions relied upon\nby the appellants will advance their case any further in the facts\nof the present case. In case of Bajaj Travels Co [2012 (25)\nS.T.R. 417 (Del.)] Hon‟ble Delhi High Court held as follows:\n\n13. We have given our due considerations to the\naforesaid submissions made by the learned counsel for\nboth the parties. The service tax was introduced by the\n\nFinance Act, 1994\nand the relevant provisions are\ncontained in Chapter-V of the said Act,\nSection 66\nis the\ncharging Section and\nSection 67\nprovides the manner of\nvaluation of taxable services for charging service tax.\n\nSection 68\nof the Act, cast an obligation on every person\nproviding taxable service to any person to collect the\nservice tax at the rate specified in\nSection 66\nof the Act.\nFrom\nSection 76\nto\nSection 80\nof the Act, different kinds of\npenalties are provided for varying default/failure on the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\npart of those who are liable to pay service tax. Since in the\ninstance case the penalties are levied under\nSection 76\n\nand\nof the Act, we reproduce these two Sections\nhereunder :-\n\n―76. Penalty for failure to pay service tax -\n\nAny person, liable to pay service tax in accordance with\nthe provisions of\nSection 68\nor the rules made under this\nChapter, who fails to pay such tax, shall pay, in addition to\nsuch tax and the interest on that tax amount in accordance\nwith the provisions of\nSection 75\n, a penalty which shall not\nbe less than two hundred rupees for every day during\nwhich such failure continues or at the rate of two per cent.\nof such tax, per month, whichever is higher, starting with\nthe first day after the due date till the date of actual\npayment of the outstanding amount of service tax :\n\nProvided that the total amount of the penalty payable in\nterms of this section shall not exceed the service tax\npayable.‖\n\n―78. Penalty for suppressing value of taxable service :\n\n[Where any service tax has not been levied or paid or has\nbeen short-levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded,\nby reason of -\n\n(a) fraud; or\n\n(b) collusion; or\n\n(c) Wilful mis-statement; or\n\n(d) suppression of facts; or\n\n(e) contravention of any of the provisions of this\nChapter or of the rules made thereunder with intent to\nevade payment of service tax.\n\nthe person, liable, to pay such service tax or erroneous\nrefund, as determined under sub-section (2) of\nSection 73\n,\nshall also be liable to pay a penalty, in addition to such\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nservice tax and interest thereon; if any, payable by him,\nwhich shall not be less than, but which shall not exceed\ntwice, the amount of service tax so not levied or paid or\nshort-levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded]\n\n[Provided that where such service tax as determined under\nsub-section (2) of\nSection 73\n, and the interest payable\nthereon under\nSection 75\nis paid within thirty days from\nthe date of communication of order of the [Central Excise\nOfficer] determining such service tax, the amount of\npenalty liable to be paid by such person under this section\nshall be twenty five per cent of the service tax so\ndetermined :\n\nProvided further that the benefit of reduced penalty under\nthe first proviso shall be available only if the amount of\npenalty so determined has also been paid within the period\nof thirty days referred to in that proviso :\n\nProvided also that where the service tax determined to be\npayable is reduced or increased by the Commissioner\n(Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be,\nthe Court, then for the purposes of this section, the service\ntax as reduced or increased, as the case may be, shall be\ntaken into account :\n\nProvided also that in case where the service tax\ndetermined to be payable is increased by the\nCommissioner (Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or, as the\ncase may be, the court, then, the benefit of reduced\npenalty under the first proviso shall be available, if the\namount of service tax so increased, the interest payable\nthereon and twenty five per cent of the consequential\nincrease of penalty have also been paid within thirty days\nof communication of the order by which such increase in\nservice tax takes effect.‖\n\nA perusal of the provisions would show that\nSection 76\n\nprovides for penalty for failure to pay service tax. In such\na case, in addition to the tax and interest on that tax\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\namount to be calculated in accordance with the provision\nof\nSection 75\n, penalty is also leviable on the defaulter\nwhich shall not be less than ` 200 for every day during\nwhich such failure continues or at the rate of two per cent\nof such tax per month whichever is higher. There is,\nhowever, a cap on this penalty stipulated in the proviso to\nthis Section which states that penalty payable is not to\nexceed the service tax payable.\n\n14. On the other hand, as per\nSection 78\n, penalty can be\nimposed for suppressing the value of taxable service. This\nprovision applies where the service tax has not been levied\nor paid or where it has been short-levied or short-paid or\nwhere the service tax has been erroneously refunded by\nreasons of circumstances stipulated therein which are\nfraud or collusion or wilful mis-statement or suppression of\nfacts or contravention of any of the provisions of this\nChapter or of the rules made thereunder. Such fraud,\ncollusion etc. has to be with intent to evade payment of\nservice tax. Thus, provision of\nSection 78\nare attracted\nwhen not only a case of fraud, collusion etc. is made out\nbut it is also established that the defaulter did not pay or\nshort-paid or got refund of the tax paid with intent to\nevade the payment of service tax. In such a case, the\nperson who is liable to pay such service tax or is\nerroneously refunded the tax can be levied the penalty\nwhich shall not be less than the amount of service tax\nevaded/refunded subject to maximum of the twice the said\namount of the non-levy/non-payment/short-levied/ short-\n\npayment/erroneous refund. However, in case the service\ntax as determined under\nSection 72(2)\nof the Act is paid\nalong with the interest payable under\nSection 75\n, within 30\ndays from the date of communication of the order, this\npenalty is to be reduced to 25% of the service tax so\ndetermined.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n15. By their very nature,\nSections 76\nand\nof the Act\noperate in two different fields.\nIn the case of\nAssistant\nCommissioner of Central Excise v. Krishna Poduval\n-\n(2005) 199 CTR 58 = 2006 (1) S.T.R. 185 (Ker.) the\nKerala High Court has categorically held that instances of\nimposition of penalty under\nSection 76\nand\nof the Act\nare distinct and separate under two provisions and even if\nthe offences are committed in the course of same\ntransactions or arise out of the same Act, penalty would be\nimposable both under\nSection 76\nand\nof the Act. We are\nin agreement with the aforesaid rule.\n\n16. No doubt,\nSection 78\nof the Act has been amended by\nthe\nFinance Act, 2008\nand the amendment provides that in\ncase where penalty for suppressing the value of taxable\nservice under\nSection 78\nis imposed, the penalty for failure\nto pay service tax under\nSection 76\nshall not apply. With\nthis amendment the legal position now is that\nsimultaneous penalties under both\nSection 76\nand\nof\nthe Act would not be levied. However, since this\namendment has come into force w.e.f. 16th May, 2008, it\ncannot have retrospective operation in the absence of any\nspecific stipulation to this effect. Going by the nature of\nthe amendment, it also cannot be said that this\namendment is only clarificatory in nature. We may\nmention that Punjab and Haryana High Court in its decision\ndated 12th July, 2010 in STA 13/2010, entitled\nCommissioner of Central Excise v. M/s. Pannu Property\nDealers, Ludhiana [2011 (24) S.T.R. 173 (P & H)] has\ntaken the view that even if the scope of two sections of the\nAct may be different, the fact that penalty has been levied\nunder\nSection 78\ncould be taken into account for levying or\nnot levying penalty under\nSection 76\nof the Act. However,\nthat was a case where the appellate authority had\nexercised its discretion not to levy the penalty under\n\nSection 76\nof the Act, when the larger penalty had already\nbeen imposed under\nSection 78\nof the Act. In this\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nscenario, the appeal of the Revenue against the said view\ntaken by the appellate authority was dismissed holding\nthat ―appellate authority was within its jurisdiction not to\nlevy the penalty under\nSection 76\nof the Act having regard\nto the fact that penalty equal to service tax had already\nbeen imposed under\nSection 78\nof the Act. This thinking\nwas also in consonance with the amendment now\nincorporated though the said amendment may not have\nbeen applicable at the relevant time. Moreover, the\namount involved is ` 51,026/- only.‖ The Court, thus,\nchose not to interfere with the aforesaid discretion of the\nTribunal.\n\n17. However, in the instant case, the appellate authority,\nincluding the Tribunal, has chosen to impose the penalty\nunder both the Sections. Since the penalty under both the\nSections is imposable as rightly held by Kerala High Court\nin\nKrishna Poduval\n(supra), the appellant cannot contend\nthat once penalty is imposed under\nSection 78\n, there\nshould not have been any penalty under\nSection 76\nof the\nFinance Act.\n\n18. We, thus, answer question no. 3 against the assessee\nand in favour of the Revenue holding that the aforesaid\namendment to\nSection 78\nby\nFinance Act, 2008\nshall\noperate prospectively.\n\n19. Coming to questions Nos. 1 & 2, the case of the\nappellant is that having regard to the provisions of\nSection\n, there was no reason to impose the penalty under\n\nSection 76\nand\nof the Finance Act.\nSection 80\nis\ncouched in the following language :-\n\n―80. Penalty not to be imposed in certain cases :\n\nNotwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of\n\nSection 76\n{\nSection 77\nor\nSection 78\n}, no penalty shall be\nimposable on the assessee for any failure referred to in the\nsaid provisions if the assessee proves that there was\nreasonable cause for the said failure.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n20. The facts narrated above, clearly disclose, and there\nis no dispute about the same, that there was failure on the\npart of the appellant to pay full service tax. It was argued\nby the learned counsel for the appellant that this provision\nhas no application as tax was paid though short-paid.\n\nSection 76\napplies only when no tax is paid at all as it\ndeals with ―failure to pay service tax‖ and not when tax is\npaid but short-paid. However, the defence of the appellant\nis that this failure was due to reasonable cause and,\ntherefore,\nSection 80\nbecomes applicable. A bare reading\nof this provision would show that the onus is upon the\nappellant to prove ―reasonable cause‖ for this failure. The\nmoot question is as to whether the appellant has been able\nto discharge this onus? Before we advert to this issue, it is\nnecessary to understand the meaning which is to be\nassigned to expression ―reasonable cause‖. It would mean,\nin common parlance a cause or ground which was not\nunreasonable. To put it otherwise, in the context of this\ncase the appellant has to show that there was sufficient\nand proper reasons which occasioned the appellant to\nmake short deposits of service tax than required under the\nprovisions of the Act. If the appellant can show that the\nmanner in which he was making the deposits of the service\ntax was bona fide i.e., in good faith, it would amount to\n‗reasonable cause'. Bona fide implies in the absence of\nfraud or unfair dealing. The equivalent of this phrase is\n―honestly‖. The correct province of this phrase is,\ntherefore, to qualify things or actions that have relation to\nthe mind or motive of the individual. Chambers 20th\nCentury Dictionary defines bona fide to mean ‗in good faith\n: genuine'. The word ‗genuine' means ‗natural : not\nspurious; real; pure; sincere'. In Law Dictionary Mozley\nand Whitley define bona fide to mean ‗good faith, without\nfraud or deceit'. Thus the term bona fide or genuinely\nrefers to a state of mind.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.36 With regards to the penalty imposed under\nSection 78\nwe\nfind that once the extended period of limitation has been invoked\nthe penalty under this section is mandatory. In case of\nRajasthan Spinning & Weaving Mills Ltd [2009 (238) ELT 3\n(SC)], Hon‟ble Supreme Court has held as follows:\n\n―16. The other provision with which we are concerned in\nthis case is Section 11AC relating to penalty. It is as\nfollows :\n\n[11AC. Penalty for short-levy or non-levy of duty in certain\ncases.- where any duty of excise has not been levied or\npaid or has been short-levied or short-paid or erroneously\nrefunded by reasons of fraud, collusion or any wilful mis-\nstatement or suppression of facts, or contravention of any\nof the provisions of this Act or of the rules made\nthereunder with intent to evade payment of duty, the\nperson who is liable to pay duty as determined under sub-\nsection (2) of section 11A, shall also be liable to pay a\npenalty equal to the duty so determined :\n\n[Provided that where such duty as determined under sub-\nsection (2) of section 11A, and the interest payable\nthereon under section 11AB, is paid within thirty days from\nthe date of communication of the order of the Central\nExcise Officer determining such duty, the amount of\npenalty liable to be paid by such person under this section\nshall be twenty-five per cent of the duty so determined :\n\nProvided further that the benefit of reduced penalty under\nthe first proviso shall be available if the amount of penalty\nso determined has also been paid within the period of\nthirty days referred to in that proviso :\n\nProvided also that where the duty determined to be\npayable is reduced or increased by the Commissioner\n(Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or, as the case may be,\nthe court, then, for the purpose of this section, the duty as\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nreduced or increased, as the case may be, shall be taken\ninto account :\n\nProvided also that in case where the duty determined to be\npayable is increased by the Commissioner (Appeals), the\nAppellate Tribunal or, as the case may be, the court, then,\nthe benefit of reduced penalty under the first proviso shall\nbe available, if the amount of duty so increased, the\ninterest payable thereon and twenty-five per cent of the\nconsequential increase of penalty have also been paid\nwithin thirty days of the communication of the order by\nwhich such increase in the duty takes effect -\n\nExplanation. - For the removal of doubts, it is hereby\ndeclared that -\n\n(1) the provisions of this section shall also apply to\ncases in which the order determining the duty under sub-\n\nsection (2) of section 11A relates to notices issued prior to\nthe date on which the\nFinance Act, 2000\nreceives the\nassent of the President;\n\n(1) any amount paid to the credit of the Central\nGovernment prior to the date of communication of the\norder referred to in the first proviso or the fourth proviso\nshall be adjusted against the total amount due from such\nperson.]\n\n17. The main body of Section 11AC lays down the\nconditions and circumstances that would attract penalty\nand the various provisos enumerate the conditions, subject\nto which and the extent to which the penalty may be\nreduced.\n\n18. One cannot fail to notice that both the proviso to sub-\n\nsection 1\nof Section 11A and Section 11AC use the same\nexpressions : ―....by reasons of fraud, collusion or any\nwilful mis-statement or suppression of facts, or\ncontravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of the\nrules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nduty,...‖. In other words the conditions that would extend\nthe normal period of one year to five years would also\nattract the imposition of penalty. It, therefore, follows that\nif the notice under Section 11A(1) states that the escaped\nduty was the result of any conscious and deliberate wrong\ndoing and in the order passed under Section 11A(2) there\nis a legally tenable finding to that effect then the provision\nof Section 11AC would also get attracted. The converse of\nthis, equally true, is that in the absence of such an\nallegation in the notice the period for which the escaped\nduty may be reclaimed would be confined to one year and\nin the absence of such a finding in the order passed under\nSection 11A(2) there would be no application of the\npenalty provision in\nSection 11AC\nof the Act. On behalf of\nthe assessees it was also submitted that Sections 11A and\n11AC not only operate in different fields but the two\nprovisions are also separated by time. The penalty\nprovision of Section 11AC would come into play only after\nan order is passed under Section 11A(2) with the finding\nthat the escaped duty was the result of deception by the\nassessee by adopting a means as indicated in Section\n11AC.\n\n19. From the aforesaid discussion it is clear that penalty\nunder Section 11AC, as the word suggests, is punishment\nfor an act of deliberate deception by the assessee with the\nintent to evade duty by adopting any of the means\nmentioned in the section.\n\n20. At this stage, we need to examine the recent decision\nof this Court in Dharamendra Textile (supra). In almost\nevery case relating to penalty, the decision is referred to\non behalf of the Revenue as if it laid down that in every\ncase of non-payment or short payment of duty the penalty\nclause would automatically get attracted and the authority\nhad no discretion in the matter. One of us (Aftab Alam, J.)\nwas a party to the decision in Dharamendra Textile and we\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nsee no reason to understand or read that decision in that\nmanner. In Dharamendra Textile the court framed the\nissues before it, in paragraph 2 of the decision, as follows :\n\n―2. A Division Bench of this Court has referred the\ncontroversy involved in these appeals to a larger Bench\ndoubting the correctness of the view expressed in\nDilip N.\nShroff v. Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai &\nAnr.\n[2007 (8) SCALE 304]. The question which arises for\ndetermination in all these appeals is whether\nSection 11AC\n\nof the Central Excise Act, 1944 (in short the ―Act') inserted\nby\nFinance Act, 1996\nwith the intention of imposing\nmandatory penalty on persons who evaded payment of tax\nshould be read to contain mens rea as an essential\ningredient and whether there is a scope for levying penalty\nbelow the prescribed minimum. Before the Division Bench,\nstand of the revenue was that said section should be read\nas penalty for statutory offence and the authority imposing\npenalty has no discretion in the matter of imposition of\npenalty and the adjudicating authority in such cases was\nduty bound to impose penalty equal to the duties so\ndetermined. The assessee on the other hand referred to\n\nSection 271(1)(c)\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short\nthe\nIT Act\n') taking the stand that\nSection 11AC\nof the Act\nis identically worded and in a given case it was open to the\nassessing officer not to impose any penalty.\n\nThe Division\nBench made reference to Rule 96ZQ and Rule 96ZO of the\nCentral Excise Rules, 1944 (in short the ―Rules') and a\ndecision of this Court in\nChairman, SEBI v. Shriram Mutual\nFund & Anr.\n[2006 (5) SCC 361] and was of the view that\nthe basic scheme for imposition of penalty under\nsection\n271(1)(c)\nof IT Act,\nSection 11AC\nof the Act and Rule\n96ZQ(5) of the Rules is common.\n\nAccording to the Division\nBench the correct position in law was\nlaid down in\n\nChairman, SEBI\n's case (supra) and not in Dilip Shroff's\ncase (supra). Therefore, the matter was referred to a\nlarger Bench.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nAfter referring to a number of decisions on interpretation\nand construction of statutory provisions, in paragraphs 26\nand 27 of the decision, the court observed and held as\nfollows :\n\n―26. In Union Budget of 1996-97,\nSection 11AC\nof the Act\nwas introduced. It has made the position clear that there is\nno scope for any discretion. In para 136 of the Union\nBudget reference has been made to the provision stating\nthat the levy of penalty is a mandatory penalty. In the\nNotes on Clauses also the similar indication has been\ngiven.\n\n―27. Above being the position, the plea that the Rules\n96ZQ and 96ZO have a concept of discretion inbuilt cannot\nbe sustained.\nDilip Shroff\n's case (supra) was not correctly\ndecided but\nChairman, SEBI\n's case (supra) has analysed\nthe legal position in the correct perspectives. The reference\nis answered.........‖.\n\n21. From the above, we fail to see how the decision in\nDharamendra Textile can be said to hold that Section 11AC\nwould apply to every case of non-payment or short\npayment of duty regardless of the conditions expressly\nmentioned in the section for its application.\n\n22. There is another very strong reason for holding that\nDharamendra Textile could not have interpreted Section\n11AC in the manner as suggested because\nin that case\n\nthat was not even the stand of the revenue. In paragraph\n5 of the decision the court noted the submission made on\nbehalf of the revenue as follows :\n\n―5. Mr. Chandrashekharan, Additional Solicitor General\nsubmitted that in Rules 96ZQ and 96ZO there is no\nreference to any mens rea as in section 11AC where mens\nrea is prescribed statutorily. This is clear from the\nextended period of limitation permissible under\nSection\n11A\nof the Act. It is in essence submitted that the penalty\nis for statutory offence. It is pointed out that the proviso to\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nSection 11A deals with the time for initiation of action.\nSection 11AC is only a mechanism for computation and the\nquantum of penalty. It is stated that the consequences of\nfraud etc. relate to the extended period of limitation and\nthe onus is on the revenue to establish that the extended\nperiod of limitation is applicable. Once that hurdle is\ncrossed by the revenue, the assessee is exposed to\npenalty and the quantum of penalty is fixed. It is pointed\nout that even if in some statues mens rea is specifically\nprovided for, so is the limit or imposition of penalty, that is\nthe maximum fixed or the quantum has to be between two\nlimits fixed. In the cases at hand, there is no variable and,\ntherefore, no discretion. It is pointed out that prior to\ninsertion of Section 11AC, Rule 173Q was in vogue in\nwhich no mens rea was provided for. It only stated ―which\nhe knows or has reason to believe‖. The said clause\nreferred to wilful action. According to learned counsel what\nwas inferentially provided in some respects in Rule 173Q,\nnow stands explicitly provided in Section 11AC. Where the\nouter limit of penalty is fixed and the statute provides that\nit should not exceed a particular limit, that itself indicates\nscope for discretion but that is not the case here.‖\n\n23. The decision in Dharamendra Textile must, therefore,\nbe understood to mean that though the application of\nSection 11AC would depend upon the existence or\notherwise of the conditions expressly stated in the section,\nonce the section is applicable in a case the concerned\nauthority would have no discretion in quantifying the\namount and penalty must be imposed equal to the duty\ndetermined under sub-section (2) of Section 11A. That is\nwhat Dharamendra Textile decides.‖\n\nThus the penalty imposed under this section cannot be faulted\nwith. However the same needs to be modified to the extent of\nquantum of tax evaded to be determined in the remand\nproceedings.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.38 Penalties under\nsection 76\nand\nare not for the\ncontumacious conduct but for the contravention of the provisions\nof statute and hence cannot be faulted. In case of Gujarat\nTravancore Agency [1989 (42) E.L.T. 350 (S.C.)] Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court has held as follow:\n\n\"4. Learned Counsel for the assessee has addressed an\nexhaustive argument before us on the question whether a\npenalty imposed under\nSection 271(1)(a)\nof the Act\ninvolves the element of mens rea and in support of his\nsubmission that it does he has placed before us several\ncases decided by this Court and the High Courts in order to\ndemonstrate that the proceedings by way of penalty under\n\nSection 271(1)(a)\nof the Act are quasi criminal in nature\nand that, therefore, the element of mens rea is a\nmandatory requirement before a penalty can be imposed\nunder Section 271(1)(a). We are relieved of the necessity\nof referring to all those decisions. Indeed, many of them\nwere considered by the High Court and are referred to in\nthe judgment under appeal. It is sufficient for us to refer to\nSection 271(1)(a), which provides that a penalty may be\nimposed if the Income Tax Officer is satisfied that any\nperson has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the\nreturn of total income, and to Section 276C which provides\nthat if a person wilfully fails to furnish in due time the\nreturn of income required under\nSection 139(1)\n, he shall\nbe punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which\nmay extend to one year or with fine. It is clear that in the\nformer case what it intended is a civil obligation while in\nthe latter what is imposed is a criminal sentence. There\ncan be no dispute that having regard to the provisions of\nSection 276C, which speaks of wilful failure on the part of\nthe defaulter and taking into consideration the nature of\nthe penalty, which is punitive, no sentence can be imposed\nunder that provision unless the element of mens rea is\nestablished. In most cases of criminal liability, the\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nintention of the Legislature is that the penalty should serve\nas a deterrent. The creation of an offence by Statute\nproceeds on the assumption that society suffers injury by\nand the act or omission of the defaulter and that a\ndeterrent must be imposed to discourage the repetition of\nthe offence. In the case of a proceeding under Section\n271(1)(a), however, it seems that the intention of the\nlegislature is to emphasise the fact of loss of Revenue and\nto provide a remedy for such loss, although no doubt an\nelement of coercion is present in the penalty. In this\nconnection the terms in which the penalty falls to be\nmeasured is significant. Unless there is something in the\nlanguage of the statute indicating the need to establish the\nelement of mens rea it is generally sufficient to prove that\na default in complying with the statute has occurred. In\nour opinion, there is nothing in Section 271(1)(a) which\nrequires that mens rea must be proved before penalty can\nbe levied under that provision. We are supported by the\nstatement in Corpus Juris Secundum Volume 85, page\n580, Paragraph 1023 :\n\n―A penalty imposed for a tax delinquency is a civil\nobligation, remedial and coercive in its nature, and is far\ndifferent from the penalty for a crime or a fine or forfeiture\nprovided as punishment for the violation of criminal or\npenal laws.‖\n\n5. Accordingly, we hold that the element of mens rea was\nnot required to be proved in the proceedings taken by the\nIncome Tax Officer under\nSection 271(1)(a)\nof the\nIncome-tax Act against the assessee for the assessment\nyears 1965-66 and 1966-67.‖\n\n4.39 Hon‟ble Delhi High Court has in the case of N & N Chopra\nConsultants Pvt. Ltd [2019 (24) G.S.T.L. 550 (Del.)] has upheld\nthe penalties imposed simultaneously under\nSection 76\nand\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nSection 78\n, for the period prior to amendments made in\nSection\nin 2008, observing as follows:\n\n―4. The facts of this case, in the opinion of this court,\nnotes that the assessee was aware about its service tax\nliability; despite this knowledge, it filed its returns claiming\nthat no liabilities were attracted. When it smelt\ninvestigation and adverse orders, it apparently approached\nthe service tax authorities and deposited the amounts\nwhich they were admittedly liable to pay. Such being the\ncase of foreknowledge, in the opinion of the court, itself is\nan important factor that ought to have been and was taken\ninto account by the lower revenue authorities. Hence,\nforeknowledge lead to the imposition of recovery of dues\nassessed as well as imposition of the penalty under Section\n\n78. The court is of the opinion that the invocation of\n\nSection 78\ncannot be faulted with having regard to the\nfacts of this case. Depositing the amount due, by the\nappellant, before issuance of show cause notice per se\ndoes not absolve the appellant of its responsibility to file\nthe returns, since the option of imposing other penalty\nunder\nSection 76\nwas exercised. Being a matter of\ndiscretion, its judicious exercise, is all that is in question.\n\nHaving regard to the fact of concurrent findings, we are of\nthe opinion that the exercise of such discretion reserving\nimposition of\nSection 76\nin the circumstances, does not call\nfor interference.\n\n5. The appellant's contention with respect to\nretrospective effect of the amendment of\nSection 78\n\n(which makes the imposition of penalties under\nSection 76\n\nand\nmutually exclusively) are unsubstantial as this\ncourt in M/s.\nBajaj Travels Limited v. Commissioner of\nService Tax, (CEAC\n6/2009, decided on 3-8-2011), 2012\n(25) S.T.R. 417 held that the amendments are prospective\nin nature and cannot come to the aid of an assessee for\npast period.‖\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\n4.40 Thus we do not find any reason to interfere with the\npenalties imposed under\nSection 76\nand\nof Finance Act, 1994.\n\nINTEREST\n\n4.41 Issue in respect of interest is settled by the Bombay High\nCourt in case of Padmashree V V Patil SSK [2007 (215) ELT 23\n(Bom)] wherein it has been held:-\n\n―12. Learned Counsel Shri Kolte has also\nplaced reliance\nupon\nthe tail piece of Explanation (2) to sub-section (2B)\nreading ―but for this sub-section‖. According to him, ―but‖\nis a conjunction used to indicate the intention of those who\nuse it to limit or restrain the sense or effect of something,\nwhich had before been said. He has obtained this meaning\nfrom Law Lexicon by P. Ramnatha Aiyar. In order to\nexamine the submission by learned Counsel as to whether\nthis terminal part of Explanation (2) gives the explanation\nso much strength as to mean that the party, which has\nutilised the facility of sub-section (2B) of payment of short\nduty as ascertained by the assessee himself, is not liable\nto pay the interest as u/s. 11AB, we have tried to search\nfor the meaning of phrase ―but for‖. As per Concise Oxford\nDictionary, 11th Edition, ―but for‖ means ―except for‖, ―if it\nwere not for‖. In view of these meanings obtained from\nthe Law Lexicon and the Oxford Dictionary attached to the\nword ―but‖ and to the phrase ―but for‖, the Advocate\npleaded that it should be interpreted that had sub-section\n(2B) not been in existence or rather the facility to pay the\nshort duty was not available, the party would have been\nrequired to pay interest u/s. 11AB and if the facility is\navailable, on compliance of the same, the party would not\nbe liable to pay interest.\n\nTaking into consideration that the tail piece relied upon by\nlearned Counsel is included in the Explanation to particular\nsub-section (2B), we are unable to accept the\ninterpretation as tried to be attributed by the learned\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nCounsel for one simple reason that an explanation ought to\nbe therefore the purpose of explaining the main provision,\nit cannot nullify the effect of main provision. If Explanation\n(2) interprets as attempted by learned Counsel due to the\nphrase with which it ends ―but for this sub-section‖, the\nexplanation will have to be ignored being in conflict with\nsub-section (2B), which it explains. However, the meaning\nof this clause ―but for this sub-section‖ can be enlightened\nwhen we refer to Section 11AB (1), we have reproduced\ntwo portions of this provision (in parts) in the earlier part\nof this judgment and for the sake of convenience, now we\nare quoting entire sub-section (1) of Section 11AB, which\nreads :\n\n―11AB. Interest on delayed payment of duty-(1) where any\nduty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been\nshort levied or short paid or erroneously refunded, the\nperson, who is liable to pay duty as determined under sub-\nsection (2), or has paid the duty under sub-section (2B) of\nSection 11A, shall in addition to duty be liable to pay\ninterest at such rate, not below 10% ....from the first date\nof the month succeeding the month in which the duty\nought to have been paid under this Act or from the date of\nsuch erroneous refund as the case may be, but for the\nprovisions contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (2B)\nof Section 11A, till the date of payment of such duty.‖\n\nThus, why the clause ―but for‖ is used, is evident from the\ntail piece of Section 11AB(1). Ordinarily, the interest is\npayable till payment of short duty as adjudicated, but in\nview of sub-section (2B), which gives liberty to the party\nto pay the short duty even before determination or without\ndetermination by the officer of Central Excise, the interest\nwould stop to run to the extent of amount deposited by\nself ascertainment and on the date such amount is so\ndeposited.\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nIf the tail piece of Explanation (2) was to be so strong as\nto nullify the effect of sub-section (2B), Section 11AB\nwould not have incorporated within it the clause ―or has\npaid the duty under sub-section (2B)‖. Reading Section\n11AB together with Section 11A (2B) and Explanation (2),\nwe are unable to accede to the interpretation tried to be\nattributed by Advocate Shri A.P. Kolte to Explanation in\nquestion.\n\n13. For all these reasons discussed, we are unable to agree\nwith the proposition that interest u/s. 11AB is also not\nchargeable in case the short duty or unpaid duty is\ndeposited with the Government before issuance of show\ncause notice.‖\n\nSummary of our findings\n\n4.42 Commissioner has in the impugned order recorded the\nfindings as follows:\n\n―1. Under the facts and circumstances narrated above,\nthe Notice must succeed. Impugned Services provided by\nthe Noticee during the relevant period are BAS to evade\nService Tax the Noticee had willfully suppressed material\nfacts and evidences during relevant period from the\njurisdictional Central Excise Authorities. The Noticee has\nalso contravened various provisions of FA'1994 and Service\nTax Rules. There is willful suppression and contravention of\nService Tax law by not informing the Department about\nthe nature of Services and related facts therein. The intent\nof evasion of service tax is evident from conduct of the\nnoticee. The Noticee did not obtain registration and did not\nfile returns as per the statutory provisions of FA1994 and\nSTR-1994\n\n2. In the facts and circumstances of his case and in\nview of above foregoing discussions and analysis hold that\nduring the relevant period the Noticee had provided BAS of\ntaxable value Rs.9,18,01,58,795 inclusive of service tax\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nbut the service tax payable thereon has not been paid. The\nliability of Service Tax is to be calculated hereunder in the\nlight of various decisions of the Cour/Tribunal given in\nGOl\nVs. MRF Ltd.\n1995(97)ELT 433(SC) and K.R.Choksey and\nCompany vs Commissioner of Central Excise, Mumbai-I\n1996 (88) ELT S66. The value of taxable service shall be\ncalculated as under:\n\nAssessable value = (Cum duty price - Permissible deductions)/ (1+\nR/100).\n\nHere in the instant case, the formula will be as under:\n\nAssessable Value = Gross amount inclusive of Service Tax/ (1+R/100)\n\nSl.

Cess\nRs. 11183089,00) as calculated above on the Services\nrendered by them during relevant period under\nSec.73\nof\nthe FA'1994\n\n3. I also hold that the Notice has rightly invoked the\nprovision of\nSection 73\nof finance Act, 1994 that they had\nwilfully suppressed material information and evidences\nfrom jurisdictional Central Excise Authorities with intent to\nevade Service Tax during the relevant period\n\n4. The Noticee was liable to pay the demanded and\ndetermined amount of Service Tax during the relevant\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nperiod. They would also liable to pay interest at the\nappropriate rate in terms of\nSection 75\nof Finance Act,\n5. The Noticee was liable to discharge their service tax\nlilability within stipulated time which they failed to do so\nand therefore they have rendered themselves liable for\npenalty under\nSection 76\nibid.\n\n6. This leads to issue of imposition of penalty upon\nNoticee under\nSection 78\nof FA'1944. As has been brought\nout, the act of willful suppression of the material facts and\nevidences from jurisdictional Central Excise authorities, for\nevading the demanded and determined Service Tax. There\nwas no explicable reasons on the part of the Noticee to\nsuppress the information, which they were statutory\nrequired to make under the law. These acts show\ncontumacious conduct on the part of the Noticee. The\npenal consequences, accordingly, must visit them\n\n7. The discussions and findings, supra, consequently\nalso answer all arguments advanced by the Noticee before\nme in this case.‖\n\n4.43 We concur with the above findings except for the finding\nrecorded in the impugned order with regards to the disallowance\nof reimbursable expenses, as observed by us in para 4.25 above.\nFor the purpose of determination of reimbursable expenses and\nallowing the deduction on the account of such expenses matter\nneeds to be remanded back to the original authority.\n\n5.1 Appeal is partly allowed to the extent indicated in para\nabove. Commissioner should recompute the demand and\npenalties imposable on the appellant after allowing the appellant\nto produce their claim to reimbursable expenses and allowing the\nsame if admissible.\n\n5.2 Needless to say as the matter is sufficiently old in the\nremand proceedings Commissioner should finalize the issue with\nService Tax Appeal No.979 of 2009\n\nregards to determination of duties and penalties as per para 5.1\nwithin a period of three months from the date of receipt of this\norder.\n\n(Pronounced in open court on-29 January, 2024)\n\nSd/-\n\n(P.K.
