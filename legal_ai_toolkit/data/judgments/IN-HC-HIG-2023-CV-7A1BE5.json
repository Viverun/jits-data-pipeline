The\n\nLearned Single Judge set aside the award dated 16 th June 2022 passed by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in international commercial arbitration proceedings on\n\nseparate applications filed by respondent nos.1 and 2 and respondent nos.3\n\nand 5 under\nSection 31(6)\nread with\nSection 32\nof the Arbitration Act that\n\nthe person who signed the notice invoking arbitration and signed the\n\nstatement of claim on behalf of Claimant, i.e., appellant herein had no valid\n\nauthority to do so, nevertheless granted liberty to cure the defect.\n\n2 The facts in brief are as under:\n\nRespondent no.6-Arya Iron & Steel Co. Pvt. Ltd., is a company\n\nregistered in Mumbai under the provisions of\nCompanies Act\n1956.\n\nAppellant and other respondents are shareholders of respondent no.6.\n\nRespondent no.6 is, inter alia, engaged in the business of manufacturing and\n\nselling of iron and steel products.\n\n3 Appellant is a company incorporated under the relevant laws of\n\nBritish Virgin Islands (BVI). Appellant is an investment company.\n\nRespondent nos.1 to 5 (RA Group) and 7 to 11 (PA Group) together with\n\nrespondent nos.12 and 13 are promoters of respondent no.6. It is appellant's\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n4/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\ncase that in view of a Shareholder's Agreement dated 25 th March 2009,\n\nappellant holds 49% shares in respondent no.6 and the balance is held by\n\nrespondent nos.1 to 5 (RA Group) and 7 to 13 (PA Group). Respondent\n\nnos.12 and 13 are closely owned and controlled by RA Group and PA\n\nGroup, i.e., respondent nos.1 to 5 and 7 to 11, respectively.\n\n4 It is appellant's case that it was asked by other respondents to join as\n\nshareholder and to infuse funds in respondent no.6. Appellant and\n\nrespondents entered into a Shareholder's Agreement as well as Share\n\nPurchase and Share Subscription Agreement all dated 25 th March 2009.\n\nAppellant invested about Rs.80 crores in respondent no.6. Appellant was\n\nmade 49% shareholder and the remaining 51% was with respondent nos.1\n\nto 5 (PA Group) and 7 to 11 (RA Group). It is appellant's case that as per\n\nthe Shareholders' Agreement, it had nominated one Sunil Jain as nominee\n\ndirector on the board of respondent no.6 and the said Sunil Jain had even\n\nattended certain board meetings. Disputes arose between appellant and\n\nrespondents, i.e., between shareholders of respondent no.6. Consequently,\n\nappellant invoked arbitration proceedings on 30 th April 2018 in terms of the\n\nShareholders' Agreement dated 25th March 2009. The Arbitral Tribunal\n\ncomprising of three members, namely, Hon'ble Mr. Justice C. K. Thakker\n\n(Retd.) as Presiding Arbitrator, Hon'ble Mr. Justice Deepak Verma (Retd.)\n\nand Hon'ble Mr. Justice Mohit Shah (Retd.)was constituted. Later on,\n\nHon'ble Mr. Justice C. K. Thakker (Retd.) resigned and he was substituted\n\nby Hon'ble Mr. Justice A. K. Sikri (Retd.).\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n5/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\n5 Right from the beginning, there were objections raised by RA Group,\n\ni.e, respondent nos.1 to 5 on the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal or on\n\nthe impartiality of the Arbitral Tribunal, etc. All these objections were\n\nrejected. In fact on the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, the Tribunal's\n\norder was challenged in the Bombay High Court before a Single Judge, who\n\ndismissed the same. The intra court appeal was also dismissed by the\n\nDivision Bench and the SLP filed also came to be dismissed.\n\n6 Thereafter, pleadings were filed by the parties and the matter\n\nproceeded to recording of evidence. Before the evidence was recorded,\n\npoints of dispute was also framed. Evidence of appellant was being recorded\n\nand appellant filed witness affidavit of two persons. Sunil Jain, who was the\n\nnominee Director of appellant in respondent no.6, appeared as CW-1 and\n\nwas cross-examined by all respondents. His testimony was completed and\n\nhe had been discharged from the proceedings as witness. Second witness\n\nwas one Gagan Preet Singh as CW-2, whose cross-examination is yet to be\n\nconcluded. CW-1 had appeared as a fact witness and CW-2, a Chartered\n\nAccountant, is produced as an expert witness. After completion of cross-\n\nexamination of CW-1 and before the cross-examination of CW-2 could\n\ncommence, an application under\nSection 31(6)\nread with\nSection 32\nof the\n\nArbitration Act was filed by respondent nos.1 and 2 on 20 th December 2021\n\n(the said application). Reply was filed by appellant. A similar application\n\nwas filed by respondent no.3 and respondent no.5. It was the case of\n\napplicant in the said applications that CW-1 - Sunil Jain, who signed and\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n6/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nverified the statement of claim did not have a valid / requisite authority to\n\ninvoke arbitration and/or institute the present claim on behalf of appellant\n\nand/or to sign and verify the pleadings and to depose on behalf of appellant\n\nas the said authority does not emanate from the resolution dated 16 th July\n\n2018 on which, Sunil Jain relied upon. The said resolution was not a valid\n\ndocument in the eyes of law. According to applicant of the said application,\n\nauthorization by the invalid document, namely the resolution in favour of\n\nSunil Jain, goes to the root of the matter. Whether the resolution is a proper\n\nand valid resolution under the laws of BVI is a matter of Foreign Law and\n\nsuch aspect in Foreign Law is required to be proved as a question of fact that\n\ntoo by an expert in Foreign Law, as required under\nSection 45\nof the Indian\n\nEvidence Act. Appellant having failed to prove that the resolution was a\n\nvalid resolution under the laws of BVI, the Arbitral Tribunal was asked to\n\npass award / interim award and declare that the claim was presented\n\nwithout authority; that the notice invoking arbitration dated 30th April 2018\n\nwas without authority and hence the Arbitral Tribunal should dismiss the\n\nclaim with cost. Naturally appellant opposed the application and submitted\n\nthat even if it is found that the authorization of Sunil Jain was not a valid\n\nauthorization, appellant was ready and willing to rectify the defect. Of\n\ncourse, this was also opposed by respondent nos.1 and 2, and 3 and 5, (the\n\nRA Group), in as much as according to these respondents there is no\n\naverment at all in the statement of claim that the resolution was validly\n\npassed under BVI laws and the resolution produced was impermissible and\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n7/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\ncannot be read in evidence as it did not meet with the requirements of\n\nSection 44\nof the Indian Evidence Act. In order to say that the resolution is\n\nvalid as per BVI laws, appellant will have to produce an expert, which\n\nopportunity appellant has already lost. Moreover, it would be on the\n\nassumption that the resolution is valid under BVI laws, which presumption\n\nwould be improper as there are no pleadings that the resolution is valid\n\nunder the BVI laws. Therefore, granting such opportunity to appellant\n\nwould mean showing indulgence to a disentitled party.\n\n7 The Arbitral Tribunal by its award dated 16 th June 2022, allowed the\n\napplication of RA Group by holding that there were no averments that the\n\nresolution authorising Sunil Jain was passed as per BVI laws and as no\n\nevidence was led to prove that the said resolution was in accordance with\n\nthe BVI laws, the resolution was invalid. The Tribunal also held that even\n\nunder the provisions of the\nCompanies Act, 2013\n, the resolution could not\n\nbe accepted and, therefore, the resolution was invalid. While holding so,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal observed that even though appellant has not proved\n\nthe resolution dated 16th July 2018 on the strength of which Sunil Jain had\n\nsigned and verified the statement of claim is a valid document under law, a\n\nfurther question is required to be decided, i.e., whether non production of\n\nvalid authorization as irregular and is curable. The Arbitral Tribunal went\n\nahead and decided the question and held that after considering the various\n\nsubmissions made including the judgments cited, the claim should not be\n\ndismissed for technical reasons as, whether the claim was signed and\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n8/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nverified by a competent person does not go to the root of the matter. In\n\nother words, the Arbitral Tribunal held that the defect was curable.\n\nParagraphs 77 and 78 of the Arbitral Tribunal's order dated 16 th June 2016\n\nread as under:\n\n\"77. The dicta of the aforesaid pronouncements is that such a\ndefect is curable. That apart, as noticed above in the present\ncase, there was no specific denial about the passing of the\nResolution by these Applicants / Respondents in their respective\ndefence statements and no specific question was raised by the\nrespondents that the resolution was not valid under the BVI\nLaws or Indian Laws. Because of this reason, no specific Issue\nwas framed either. Therefore, there was no occasion for the\nClaimant to lead any evidence on this aspect. This is yet another\nreason that the Claimant should be given a chance to show that\nMr. Sunil Jain is vested with necessary authority to institute the\npresent Arbitration proceedings and has also been authorised to\nsign and verify the statement of claim and to depose in the\nmatter. Non granting of such an opportunity would cause\nprejudice to the Claimant and would amount to miscarriage of\njustice to the Claimant.\n\n78. The claimant can do so either by proving that the Resolution\ndated 16.07.2018 placed on record is a valid Resolution under\nBVI laws or by filing fresh Resolution, as this irregularity is\nratifiable as well. The Tribunal grants two weeks' time to the\nClaimant to respond as to which option the Claimant would like\nto exercise so that further directions are issued by the Tribunal in\nthis behalf.\"\n\n8 Aggrieved by this liberty granted by the Arbitral Tribunal to rectify the\n\ndefect, two separate petitions under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act were\n\nfiled by respondent nos.1, 2, 3 and 5. Both the petitions were heard\n\ntogether and by a common order and judgment pronounced on\n\n1st November 2022, Learned Single Judge of this court held that the\n\nimpugned orders / interim award would be in contravention of the public\n\npolicy of India and fundamental Policy of Indian Law. According to the\n\nLearned Single Judge, it was impossible for the Arbitral Tribunal to permit\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n9/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nratification of the resolution /rectifying the defect. It is that order, i.e.,\n\nimpugned in this appeal.\n\nAppellant did not challenge the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal,\n\nsince, as submitted by Mr. Setalvad, appellant was anyways given a chance\n\nto rectify the defect.\n\nOther than Mr. Setalvad, Mr. Sharan Jagtiani and Mr. Haresh Jagtiani,\n\nnone of the other counsel made any submissions.\n\n9 Mr. Setalvad submitted as under:\n\n(a) The defect in the board resolution is a procedural defect and is\n\ncurable.\n\n(b) The Arbitral Tribunal has held that there was defect in the board\n\nresolution but has also held that such a defect was curable and accordingly\n\ngave appellant the opportunity to prove that the board resolution was valid\n\nunder BVI laws or file a fresh resolution. These directions were passed by\n\nconsidering and keeping with the settled position in law as laid down by the\n\nApex Court and various High Courts including this court.\n\n(c) The suit filed by a company with defective board resolution or even\n\nwithout any board resolution at all is not fatal. It is procedural in nature\n\nand is curable defect. A substantive right should not be allowed to be\n\ndefeated on account of a procedural irregularity which can be cured at any\n\ntime, as held in\nUnited Bank of India Vs.

Yet the court held that\n\nsuch a defect is merely a procedural irregularity which can be cured.\n\nAppellant could not be worse-off than in cases where there was no board\n\nresolution at all.\n\n(e) In\nUnited Bank of India\n(supra) the court has held that in addition to\n\nand dehors\nOrder 29 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure\nCode (\nCPC\n), a\n\ncompany can authorise any person to sign the plaint on its behalf and that\n\nwould be considered sufficient compliance with\nOrder 6 Rule 14 of the CPC\n.\n\nFurther, in\nUnited Bank of India\n(Supra) and\nPragya Electronics\n\n(Supra) nowhere it is mentioned that the signatories were persons falling\n\nunder\nOrder 29 Rule 1 of the CPC\n.\n\n(f) The Learned Single Judge by distinguishing the judgments relied\n\nupon by appellant on the grounds that none of them involved arbitration\n\nproceedings is patently wrong.\nIn\nPragya Electronics\n(supra) where\nUnited\n\nBank of India\n(supra) and\nSangat Printers\n(supra) was followed, was a case\n\ninvoking arbitration proceedings.\n\n4.

This is because the law\nlaid down in\nthe judgments cited above\n\nis that the defect is procedural in nature and is curable and it would apply\n\nequally to arbitration proceedings.\n\n(h) The signing and verification of the statement of claim was a matter of\n\nprocedure. The same was governed by Indian Law. Matter of procedure\n\nshould always be governed by law of the country, where the court / tribunal\n\nis situated. It is not in the realm of substantive law. This has been the\n\nconsistent position of Indian Law as held in\nAll India Reporter Vs.\n\nRamchandra Dhondo Datar9\n,\nCement Co. Ltd. Vs. Abdul Hessein Essaji10\n,\n\nGanpati Nana Powar Vs. Jivanabai Kom Subanna11\n, Netram Dadaram\n\nPalliwal Vs. Bhagwan Wallaji Kunbi12 , and\nVatech Global Co. Vs. Unicorn\n\nDenmart Ltd.13\n\n(i) It is settled position in law that all matters of procedure such as\n\nsigning and verification are governed by the domestic law of the country,\n\nwhere the court is situated - Lex Fori (Dicey, Morris and Collins on the\n\nConflict of Law14). There is a presumption of proper verification and\n\nexecution of statement of claim.\n\n(j) As per Section 85 read with\nSection 57(6)\nof the Indian Evidence Act,\n\nsigning and verification of plaint / statement of claim does not require\n\nevidence to prove the same as courts will take judicial notice of such\n\n9. 1959 SCC Online Bom 152\n\n10.

The onus of proving Foreign Law as a fact always\n\nlies upon the party relying upon it.

The\n\norder of the Arbitral Tribunal is clearly not contrary to the most basic\n\nnotions of justice such as would shock the conscience of the court. Notably,\n\nthe ground of patent illegality is not available in the present case, as\n\nappellant is a foreign entity, as per the provisions of\nSection 34\n(2-A read\n\nwith\nSection 2(1)(f)(ii)\nof the Arbitration Act and Vijay Karia Vs.

On the contrary, the order of\n\nArbitral Tribunal is in keeping with the fundamental policy of Indian Law. If\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal had not permitted, then it would have been contrary to\n\npublic law.\n\n(o) The Arbitral Tribunal's order is not an interim award and not\n\namenable to challenge under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act because the\n\norder is not a judicial determination of any of the issues framed by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal. It does not decide any legal rights or liabilities of the\n\nparties under the shareholders agreement dated 25th March 2009.\n\n(p) The question of illegality and/or validity of the board resolution was\n\nnot even an issue since there was no denial in the statement of defence.\n\nThe order was merely a procedural order passed under\nSection 19\nof the\n\nArbitration Act pursuant to an application under\nSection 31\nread with\n\nSection 32\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\n(q) As there was no denial qua the passing of the resolution in the\n\nrespective statements of defence, no specific issue was framed on this aspect\n\nand hence there was no occasion for appellant to lead evidence on the point\n\nof the validity of the resolution.

The nature\n\nof orders passed in these judgments cited by appellant are entirely distinct\n\nfrom the impugned order.\n\nSimilarly appellant's reliance on\nFuture Coupons\n\nPvt Ltd.\n(Supra), is also misconceived because in\nFuture Coupons\n(Supra)\n\nthe application before the Arbitral Tribunal was only under\nSection 33(2)(c)\n\nof the Arbitration Act and not for an interim award under\nSection 31(6)\n\nread with\nSection 2(c)\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n17/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\n(c) The Arbitral Tribunal's findings are in favour of respondents on\n\nmatters of pleading, matters of evidence and position of Indian Law under\n\nthe\nIndian Companies Act, 2013\n. The Arbitral Tribunal having categorically\n\nfound in favour of respondents that appellant has not proved the board\n\nresolution dated 16th July 2018 on the strength of which, Sunil Jain had\n\nsigned and verified the statement of claim as a valid document under law,\n\nnevertheless, wrongfully allowed appellant to cure the invalidity. The\n\nArbitral Tribunal's reasoning was since the defect is curable and since there\n\nwas no specific denial of the passing of the board resolution in the\n\nrespondents' statement of defence and no specific question was raised on\n\nthis aspect - no issue was framed or in the absence of issue being framed,\n\nthere was no occasion for appellant to lead evidence in this aspect. For those\n\nreasons, appellant should be given an opportunity to show that Sunil Jain is\n\nauthorized to sign and verify the statement of claim and depose on behalf of\n\nappellant, was flawed.\n\n(d) To the extent, the Arbitral Award permits appellant to cure the\n\ninvalidity of the board resolution, is in conflict with the public policy of\n\nIndia and is liable to be set aside. This is because it negates and reverses the\n\nfinality of findings in favour of respondents confirming subject matter of the\n\ninterim award thus giving appellant a clean slate to re-agitate disputed\n\nmatters of substance arising in the arbitration.\n\n(e) Once it has been held on appreciation of pleadings and evidence led\n\nin this regard that Sunil Jain lacks the requisite authority to sign and verify\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n18/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nthe statement of claim, the issue stood determined. The Arbitral Tribunal's\n\njurisdiction to consider this issue ends on such determination. The Arbitral\n\nTribunal cannot extend its jurisdiction by permitting appellant to cure the\n\ninvalidity of Sunil Jain's authority and thereby retain the jurisdiction to once\n\nagain determine his authority to sign and verify the statement of claim.\n\n(f) If the party is allowed to lead evidence once it has chosen not to do\n\nso, no litigation will ever end. Such course of action would also militate\n\nagainst the fundamental policy of Indian Law which tries to attain finality to\n\narbitral awards.\n\n(g) If authority to a person to institute legal proceedings was given at a\n\nboard meeting held on a particular date and it is established after trial, that\n\nthe meeting was held, in a manner unknown to law, or that in fact no such\n\nmeeting was held on the date stated by plaintiff, the court would not allow\n\nplaintiff to undo the effect of that finding by once again holding a meeting\n\nto issue such authority. Such opportunities erodes the binding finality of\n\nawards. There is fundamental and inherent contradiction in the interim\n\naward in as much as, on the one hand the Arbitral Tribunal holds that\n\npleadings regarding the validity of the board resolution are required to be\n\nmade by appellant in the statement of claim itself since appellant would not\n\nknow what position respondents may take in the statement of claim in this\n\nregard. Such pleadings are entirely absent. The Arbitral Tribunal rejects\n\nappellant's submission that the lack of specific denial of the board resolution\n\nin respondents' statement of defence amounts to admission of its validity.\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n19/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal noticed that PA group in the reference has denied the\n\nexistence and validity of the board resolution and, therefore, appellant was\n\nput to notice of its burden to prove the same.\n\nIn a departure from this reasoning, however, an opportunity is given\n\nby the Arbitral Tribunal to appellant to cure the invalidity of the board\n\nresolution is premised on the reasoning that there is no specific denial of the\n\nvalidity of the board resolution by respondents in their statements of\n\ndefence due to which no specific issue was framed and as such no evidence\n\nwas led by appellant in this regard. Therefore, by giving an opportunity to\n\ncure the defect, the Arbitral Tribunal has given not one but two options,\n\nwhen no such opportunity was sought by appellant.\n\n(h) Appellant never even made an application to the Arbitral Tribunal to\n\nallow it to cure the validity for Sunil Jain's authorization to sign and verify\n\nthe statement of claim. Still an opportunity was given.\n\n(i) The Arbitral Tribunal has exercised jurisdiction in equity ( Ex Aequo\n\nEtbono/ Amiable Compositeur) which is not permitted under\nSection 28\nof\n\nthe Arbitration Act. This was not a case where the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nexercised power in law available to it on a matter of mere procedure. It was\n\nentirely a matter of substance decided in accordance with substantive law.\n\nThe opportunity to cure the defect in the board resolution by the options in\n\nparagraph 77 of the award are demonstrably an exercise of power in equity.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal holds that if it does not grant appellant an opportunity\n\nto cure the invalidity of Sunil Jain's authority, it would cause prejudice to\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n20/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nappellant and that would amount to miscarriage of justice to appellant.\n\nThis is a clear exercise of equitable jurisdiction under\nSection 28(2)\nof the\n\nArbitration Act, where it was not available to the Arbitral Tribunal. The\n\nobservations in Interocean Shipping India Pvt Ltd. Vs. ONGC32 are apposite\n\neven to the present case. None of the judgments relied upon by appellant\n\neven remotely apply.\n\n(j) In the circumstances, the appeal has to be dismissed.\n\n11 Mr. Haresh Jagtiani, in addition to adopting the submissions of Mr.\n\nSharan Jagtiani, submitted as under:\n\n(a) The Arbitral Tribunal having held that the resolution based on which\n\nSunil Jain signed the pleadings was illegal on the basis of the substantive\n\nlaw applicable in India, which is the applicable law governing the\n\narbitration, could not have given the liberty to cure the defect.\n\n(b) Sunil Jain was the only fact witness deposing on behalf of appellant\n\nand the resolution relied upon by him having been held as not proved, the\n\nresolution becomes inadmissible in evidence and no part of the award can\n\nbe based upon an inadmissible document under the\nIndian Evidence Act\n\n1872. The issue is purely one of substance and not procedure which is\n\nincapable of being cured in the manner in which it is sought to be by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal.\n\n(c) The resolution has been passed by appellant which is a BVI registered\n\ncompany whose sole director is Execorp, a corporate entity whose place of\n\n32. 2022 SCC Online Bom 1699\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n21/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nregistration is unknown. Applying the test of Indian Law, such a company\n\nlike appellant will not be recognized as a legal entity given that\nSection 149\n\nof the Companies Act 2013 only permits a natural person to be a director\n\nand not another artificial entity. This also has been held by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal against appellant and by this yardstick as well the resolution has\n\nbeen declared to be invalid. It is on a pure question of substance that this\n\nfinding has been arrived at.\n\n(d) Paragraphs 77 and 78 of the award are at odds with the rest of the\n\nfindings in the award. The liberty given in paragraph 78 to file a fresh\n\nresolution can only be explained or justified on principles of equity and\n\ngood conscience.\nSection 28 (2)\nof the Arbitration Act does not permit this\n\nunless parties have agreed under the contract that the Arbitral Tribunal can\n\nfall back on equity.\n\n(e) The Arbitral Tribunal is a creature of contract between two parties\n\nintending to resolve their dispute by arbitrators of their choice and\nSection\n\n28(2)\nof the Arbitration Act proscribes the Arbitral Tribunal from exercising\n\nequitable jurisdiction except, if expressly agreed by contract of parties\n\nreferring the resolution of their dispute to arbitration.\n\n(f) Since the parties had not agreed to the Arbitral Tribunal applying\n\nprinciples of equity, the Arbitral Tribunal could not have given the\n\nopportunity to appellant to cure the defect.\n\n12 Though elaborate submissions were made, the issues at hand are :-\n\n(a) Whether petition filed by respondent nos.1 to 4 under\nSection 34\nof\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n22/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nthe Arbitration Act was maintainable ?\n\n(b) Whether, (i) Arbitral Tribunal having found in favour of respondents\n\nin holding that Sunil Jain was neither a Secretary nor a Director nor other\n\nprincipal officer of appellant and the board resolution dated 16 th July 2018,\n\non the strength of which Sunil Jain has signed and verified the statement of\n\nclaim, is not a valid document under law, could the Arbitral Tribunal say\n\nthat the defect was curable or ratifiable? and (ii) for the reasons mentioned\n\nin paragraph 77 of the award, appellant should be given a chance to show\n\nthat Sunil Jain is vested with necessary authority to institute the present\n\narbitration proceedings and also has been authorised to sign and verify the\n\nstatement of claim and to depose in the matter or in the alternative file a\n\nfresh resolution ?\n\n(c) Whether Section 28 of the Arbitration Act would be applicable in as\n\nmuch as, granting an opportunity to rectify the defect is an exercise of\n\npowers under Section 28(2) of the Arbitration Act which parties have not\n\nexpressly authorised the Arbitral Tribunal to do so.\n\nOur answers are as under:\n\nIssue (a):-\n\n13 On the issue of the maintainability of petition under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration Act, we would hold that the petition was maintainable. The\n\nApex Court in\nIFFCO\n(supra) has held that the words \"any matter\" used in\n\nSection 31(6)\nof the Arbitration Act is very wide in nature and that an\n\ninterim award may be made on \"any matter\" with respect to which the\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n23/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nArbitral Tribunal may make a final Arbitral Award. The expression \"matter\"\n\nis wide in nature and subsumes issues at which the parties herein are in\n\ndispute. Paragraph 8 of IFFCO reads as under:\n\n\"8. The language of\nSection 31(6)\nis advisedly wide in nature. A\nreading of the said sub-section makes it clear that the jurisdiction to\nmake an interim arbitral award is left to the good sense of the arbitral\ntribunal, and that it extends to \"any matter\" with respect to which it\nmay make a final arbitral award. The expression \"matter\" is wide in\nnature, and subsumes issues at which the parties are in dispute. It is\nclear, therefore, that any point of dispute between the parties which\nhas to be answered by the arbitral tribunal can be the subject matter of\nan interim arbitral award. However, it is important to add a note of\ncaution. In an appropriate case, the issue of more than one award may\nbe necessitated on the facts of that case. However, by dealing with the\nmatter in a piecemeal fashion, what must be borne in mind is that the\nresolution of the dispute as a whole will be delayed and parties will be\nput to additional expense. The arbitral tribunal should, therefore,\nconsider whether there is any real advantage in delivering interim\nawards or in proceeding with the matter as a whole and delivering one\nfinal award, bearing in mind the avoidance of delay and additional\nexpense. Ultimately, a fair means for resolution of all disputes should\nbe uppermost in the mind of the arbitral tribunal.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court was considering whether a decision on limitation\n\nis an interim award which can be independently and separately challenged\n\nunder\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\nParagraph 30 of IFFCO\n(supra)\n\nreads as under:\n\n\"30. In our view, therefore, it is clear that the award dated 23 rd July,\n2015 is an interim award, which being an arbitral award, can be\nchallenged separately and independently under\nSection 34\nof the\nArbitration Act. We are of the view that such an award, which does\nnot relate to the arbitral tribunal's own jurisdiction under\nSection 16\n,\ndoes not have to follow the drill of\nSection 16(5)\nand (6) of the Act.\nHaving said this, we are of the view that Parliament may consider\namending\nSection 34\nof the Act so as to consolidate all interim\nawards together with the final arbitral award, so that one challenge\nunder\nSection 34\ncan be made after delivery of the final arbitral\naward. Piecemeal challenges like piecemeal awards lead to\nunnecessary delay and additional expense.\"\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n24/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\n14 The facts and issues which arose in\nMSEDCL\n(Supra) are almost\n\nsimilar to that of the present matter.\n\nIn\nMSEDCL\n(supra), the respondent in\n\nthe arbitration challenged the claimant's authority to file a claim on behalf a\n\njoint venture. The respondent filed a formal application for issuance of an\n\ninterim award under\nSection 31(6)\nof the Arbitration Act dismissing the\n\nclaim. The tribunal rejected this application. The Learned Single Judge of\n\nthis court allowed the petition filed by MSEDCL under\nSection 34\nof the\n\nArbitration Act and dismissed the claim. The Court held that the claimant's\n\nJV partner- Electropath had not authorized the filing of the claim. The\n\nLearned Single Judge found that Electropath did not give any express\n\nauthority in favour of the claimant to refer the dispute to arbitration arising\n\nout of the business relating to the joint venture, and the claimant could not\n\nlegally represent Electropath as lead member of the said joint venture in\n\nabsence of any express authority on behalf of the Electropath.\n\nSignificantly, the court held that the arbitrator ought to have held that the\n\nstatement of claim filed by the claimant in its individual capacity was not\n\nmaintainable and ought to have allowed the said application filed by the\n\nRespondents under\nsection 31(6)\nof the Arbitration Act and ought to have\n\ndismissed the claims made by the claimant. Consequently, this Court\n\nallowed the petition under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act and allowed the\n\napplication filed by MSEDCL under\nSection 31(6)\nof the Arbitration Act and\n\nordered dismissal of the claim.\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n25/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\n15 Both these judgments, i.e.\nIFFCO\n(supra) and\nMSEDCL\n(supra) relied\n\non by Respondents is subsequent in time vis-à-vis the judgments cited by\n\nappellant.\n\n16 Advocating a narrower construction of what constitutes an interim\n\naward appellant relied on various judgments, i.e., Harinarayan G.

The nature of orders passed in the judgments cited by\n\nappellant are entirely distinct from the Order dated 16th June 2022.\n\n17 Appellant's reliance on the judgment of\nFree Coupons Pvt Ltd.\n(supra)\n\non this aspect is not correct. In that case the order of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nwas challenged, and the Hon'ble Delhi High Court did not entertain the\n\nchallenge under\nSection 34\nof the Arbitration Act.\n\nThe main distinction that appellant misses is that in\nFuture Coupons\n\nPvt Ltd.\n(supra) the application before the Arbitral Tribunal was only under\n\nSection 32(2)(c)\nof the Arbitration Act and not for an Interim Award under\n\nSection 31(6)\nread with\nSection 2(c)\nof the Arbitration Act. In that case, the\n\nquestion was whether order of Competition Commission of India dated 17 th\n\nDecember 2022 and order of the National Company Law Tribunal admitting\n\nan application against Future FRL would prevent the arbitration from\n\nproceeding.

Interocean Shipping (India)\n\nPvt Ltd.35 learned single Judge of this court held that though the Arbitral\n\nTribunal is not bound by the Evidence Act and Civil Procedure Code, the\n\n35. 2017 Scc Online Bom 1032\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n29/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nprinciples thereof will still apply. Paragraph 48 of Oil Natural Gas\n\nCorporation Ltd. (Supra) reads as under:\n\n\"48. This Court has already held in catena of the decisions that though\nunder\nSection 19\nof the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the\narbitral tribunal was not bound by\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908,\n\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872\n, the arbitral tribunal is still bound by the\nprinciples of\nIndian Evidence Act\n,\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 and\nalso the principles of natural justice. In my view, the impugned award\non this issue shows clear perversity and patent illegality.\"\n\n22 In\nUnited Bank of India\n(supra) the Apex Court has held that letter of\n\nauthority of an individual, who had signed the pleadings on behalf of the\n\ncompany can be cured by the company subsequently. The court held that\n\nwhere suits are instituted or defended on behalf of a public corporation,\n\npublic interest should not be permitted to be defeated on a mere\n\ntechnicality. Though appellant is not a public corporation, a litigant's\n\ninterest should not be permitted to be defeated on a mere technicality.\n\nProcedural defects which do not go to the root of the matter should not be\n\npermitted to defeat a just cause. There is sufficient power in the Courts,\n\nunder\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\n, to ensure that injustice is not done to any\n\nparty who has a just case. As far as possible a substantive right should not\n\nbe allowed to be defeated on account of a procedural irregularity which is\n\ncurable. The court also held that in the absence of a person expressly\n\nauthorised to sign the pleadings on behalf of the company, for example by\n\nthe Board of Directors passing a resolution to that effect or by a power of\n\nattorney being executed in favour of any individual, the company can ratify\n\nthe said action of it's officer in signing the pleadings. Such ratification can\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n30/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nbe express or implied.\n\nParagraphs 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 of United Bank of\n\nIndia\n(supra) read as under:\n\n8. In this appeal, therefore, the only question which arises for\nconsideration is whether the plaint was duly signed and verified by a\ncompetent person.\n\n9. In cases like the present where suits are instituted or defended on\nbehalf of a public corporation, public interest should not be permitted\nto be defeated on a mere technicality. Procedural defects which do not\ngo to the root of the matter should not be permitted to defeat a just\ncause. There is sufficient power in the Courts, under\nthe Code of Civil\nProcedure\n, to ensure that injustice is not done to any party who has a\njust case. As far as possible a substantive right should not be allowed\nto be defeated on account of a procedural irregularity which is\ncurable.\n\n10. It cannot be disputed that a company like the appellant can sue\nand be sued in its own name. Under\nOrder 6 Rule 14 of the Code of\nCivil Procedure\na pleading is required to be signed by the party and its\npleader, if any. As a company is a juristic entity it is obvious that some\nperson has to sign the pleadings on behalf of the company.\nOrder 29\nRule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, therefore, provides that in a\nsuit by against a corporation the Secretary or any Director or other\nPrincipal officer of the corporation who is able to depose to the facts\nof the case might sign and verify on behalf of the company. Reading\nOrder 6 Rule 14 together with\nOrder 29 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure\nit would appear that even in the absence of any formal\nletter of authority or power of attorney having been executed a\nperson referred to in Rule 1 of Order 29 can, by virtue of the office\nwhich he holds, sign and verify the pleadings on behalf of the\ncorporation. In addition thereto and de hors\nOrder 29 Rule 1 of the\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, as a company is a juristic entity, it can duly\nauthorise any person to sign the plaint or the written statement on its\nbehalf and this would be regarded as sufficient compliance with the\nprovisions of\nOrder 6 Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n. A person\nmay be expressly authorised to sign the pleadings on behalf of the\ncompany, for example by the Board of Directors passing a resolution\nto that effect or by a power of attorney being executed in favour of\nany individual. In absence thereof and in cases where pleadings have\nbeen signed by one of it's officers a Corporation can ratify the said\naction of it's officer in signing the pleadings. Such ratification can be\nexpress or implied. The Court can, on the basis of the evidence on\nrecord, and after taking all the circumstances of the case, specially\nwith regard to the conduct of the trial, come to the conclusion that\nthe corporation had ratified the act of signing of the pleading by it's\nofficer.\n\n11. The courts below could have held that Sh. L.K. Rohatgi must have\nbeen empowered to sign the plaint on behalf of the appellant. In the\nalternative it would have been legitimate to hold that the manner in\nwhich the suit was conducted showed that the appellant bank must\nhave ratified the action of Sh. L.K. Rohatgi in signing the plaint. If, for\nany reason whatsoever, the courts below were still unable to come to\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n31/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nthis conclusion, then either of the appellate courts ought to have\nexercised their jurisdiction under Order 41 Rule 27 (1) (b)\nof the\nCode of Civil Procedure\nand should have directed a proper power of\nattorney to be produced or they could have ordered Sh. L.K. Rohatgi\nor any other competent person to be examined as a witness in order\nto prove ratification or the authority of Sh. L.K. Rohatgi to sign the\nplaint. Such a power should be exercised by a court in order to ensure\nthat injustice is not done by rejection of a genuine claim.\n\n12. ********************\n\n13. The court had to be satisfied that Sh. L.K. Rohatgi could sign the\nplaint on behalf of the appellant. The suit had been filed in the name\nof the appellant company; full amount of court fee had been paid by\nthe appellant bank; documentary as well as oral evidence had been\nled on behalf of the appellant and the trial of the suit before the Sub\nJudge, Ambala, had continued for about two years. It is difficult, in\nthese circumstances, even to presume that the suit had been filed and\ntried without the appellant having authorised the institution of the\nsame. The only reasonable conclusion which we can come to is that\nSh. L.K. Rohatgi must have been authorised to sign the plaint and, in\nany case, it must be held that the appellant had ratified the action of\nSh. L.K. Rohatgi in signing the plaint and thereafter it continued with\nthe suit.\n\n23 In the impugned order, the Learned Single Judge has accepted that\n\nthis is the position in law but states that none of the cases relied upon by\n\nappellant apply to the arbitral proceedings. According to the Learned Single\n\nJudge, the cases relied upon by appellant either arose out of the order\n\npassed by the Civil Court, which unlike an Arbitral Tribunal is a Court of\n\nplenary jurisdiction or in respect of filing of winding up petition. According\n\nto the Learned Single Judge, the Arbitral Tribunal unlike a Court of plenary\n\njurisdiction is a creature of contract governed by the agreement between the\n\nparties and cannot act in equity, in the absence of an express authorisation\n\nby the parties. As we will observe later\nSection 28\nof the Arbitration Act is\n\nnot applicable.\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n32/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nIn fact, as noted earlier, the Apex Court in\nSrei Infrastructure Finance\n\nLtd.\n(supra) relying on\nNahar Industrial Enterprises\n(supra) has held that\n\nSection 19\ncannot be read to mean that the arbitral tribunal is incapacitated\n\nin drawing sustenance from any provisions laid down under\nthe CPC\n. Just\n\nbecause the Arbitral Tribunal is not bound by the code, it does not mean\n\nthat it would not have jurisdiction to exercise powers of a court as contained\n\nin\nthe CPC\n. Rather, the Arbitral Tribunal can travel beyond\nCPC\nand the\n\nonly fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural\n\njustice.\nThe Apex Court in Jugraj Singh (supra) has held that once it is\n\nratified, the ratification is thrown back to the date of the act done and the\n\nagent is put in the same position as if he had authority to do the act at the\n\ntime the act was done by him. Therefore, in our view, the decision of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal to permit appellant to cure the defect is perfectly justified.\nSection 28\nof the Arbitration Act deals with the question, which law\n\nor rules the Arbitral Tribunal shall apply to the substance of the dispute. The\n\nexpression \"substance of the dispute\" could have reference only to the\n\nmerits of the case. We draw support for this view from Justice R.S.\n\nBachawat's Law of Arbitration and Conciliation36 (Bachawat), where it reads\n\nas under:\n\n\"UNCITRAL Report on Adoption of Model Law\n\nParagraph (1) [Corresponding to Ss. 19(1) and (2)]\n\nTwo suggestions of divergent significance were made with respect to\nparagraph (1).

The other suggestion\nwas to permit the parties to determine rules of procedure after the\narbitrators had accepted their duties to the extent the arbitrators agreed\n(Para 171].\n\nNeither suggestion was adopted. Although the provision as it now stood\nimplied that the parties had a continuing right to change the procedure,\nthe arbitrators could not in fact be forced to accept changes in the\nprocedure because they could resign if they did not wish to carry out new\nprocedures agreed to by the parties. It was noted that the time-frame\nallowed for changing the procedures to be followed could be settled\nbetween the parties and the arbitrators [Para 172]\nParagraph (2) [Corresponding to Ss. 19(3) and (4)]\n\nAn observation was made that, since in some legal systems a question of\nadmissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence would be\nconsidered to be a matter of substantive law, the question arose as to the\nrelationship between the second sentence of paragraph (2) and\nArt. 28.\n\n[Para 173].\n\nIt was understood that the objective of paragraph (2) was to recognize a\ndiscretion of the arbitral tribunal which would not be affected by the\nchoice of law applicable to the substance of the dispute (Para 174).\n\nThe Commission adopted paragraph (2) [Para 175]\n\nUNCITRAL Model Law\n\nSection 28\n(except clause (a) of sub-\nsection 1\n) corresponds to\nArticle 28\nof\nthe UNCITRAL Model Law.\n\n*************************************\n\nAnalytical Commentary on UNCITRAL Draft Model Law\n\nArticle 28.\nRules applicable to substance of dispute\n\n(1) The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with such\nrules of law as are chosen by the parties as applicable to the substance of\nthe dispute.

This question, which\nshould be distinguished from the issue of the law applicable to the arbitral\nprocedure or the arbitration agreement is often dealt with in conventions\nand national laws devoted to private international law or conflict of laws.\nHowever, it is sometimes covered by national laws on arbitration and often\nby arbitration conventions and arbitration rules.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nDuring the hearing we had suggested to the counsel to also consider\n\nthe UNCITRAL reports.\n\n25 The issue at hand was not substance of the dispute. The substance of\n\nthe dispute is the dispute and differences between the parties on account of\n\nshareholding in respondent no.6, which according to appellant was misused\n\nby PA group that gave them future dominance over respondent no.6. Even\n\nif, for a moment we stretch to hold that the Arbitral Tribunal has exercised\n\njurisdiction in equity by allowing appellant to cure the irregularity, still it\n\nwill not be hit by the provisions of\nSection 28(2)\nof the Arbitration Act\n\nbecause\nSection 28\nof the Arbitration Act deals with the question which law\n\nor rules the Arbitral Tribunal shall apply to the substance of the dispute,\n\nwould mean the merits of the case. The object of\nSections 19(3)\nand\n19(4)\n\nof the Arbitration Act is to recognize the discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\non matters that do not relate to the substance of the dispute, whereas,\n\nSection 28\nof the Arbitration Act deals with substance of the dispute in\n\ncontradistinction to the law applicable to the procedure.\n\nPages 1570/1571 in Bachawat says:\n\nAccording to\nArticle 28(3)\n, the parties may authorize the arbitral\ntribunal to decide the dispute ex aequo et bono or as amiables\ncompositeurs. This type of arbitration is currently not known or used in\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n35/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nall legal systems and there exists no uniform understanding as regards\nthe precise scope of the power of the arbitral tribunal. When parties\nanticipate an uncertainty in this respect, they may wish to provide a\nclarification in the arbitration agreement by a more specific\nauthorization to the arbitral tribunal. Paragraph (4) makes clear that in\nall cases, i.e., including an arbitration ex aequo et bono, the arbitral\ntribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract and\nshall take into account the usages of trade applicable to the transaction\n[Para 36]\n\nThis also indicates that\nSection 28\napplies only to the substance of the\n\ndispute, that is, the transaction that is under dispute and not procedural\n\nissues as in the case at hand.\n\nSection 28(2)\nprovides the arbitral tribunal shall decide ex aequo et\n\nbono or as amiable compositeur only if the parties have expressly\n\nauthorised it to do so. If the arbitrators are appointed as amiable\n\ncompositerus, they are exempt from the obligations of hearing the parties\n\nand their respective proofs, or establish default against them and decide\n\naccording to the rule of law. These are clauses used in transactions where\n\nthe parties are contracting for a long relationship, in which the maintenance\n\nof commercial trust between the parties is reasonably assured. These are\n\nclauses where the arbitrator is freed from any duty to respect the rule of\n\nlaw when deciding upon the merits of the dispute. The Arbitrator can\n\nignore technicalities and strict constructions and need not conform in the\n\nordinary legal procedures when conducting the reference.\n\nIn the case at hand the arbitral tribunal has not ignored the technical\n\nobjections raised by RA Group. It has infact conformed to the law laid down\n\nby the Apex Court and various High Courts and has respected the rule of\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n36/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nlaw while deciding the objection raised by the RA Group.\n\nTherefore, to say the Arbitral Tribunal by holding that appellant\n\nshould be able to correct on irregularity, cannot be stated to have acted as\n\n\"amiable compositeurs\" or \"ex aequo et bono\". The Arbitral Tribunal has\n\nacted according to law and applied principles of natural justice.\n\n26 The Arbitral Tribunal in our view, had not acted contrary to the law or\n\ndisregarded the law but has applied the correct position in law. The Arbitral\n\nTribunal has applied the principles of Order 29 Rule 4 read with\nOrder 6\n\nRule 14 of the CPC\nand as noted earlier, there was no fetter in the Arbitral\n\nTribunal in doing so. The Arbitral Tribunal has acted in accordance with the\n\nfundamental policy and Indian Law and granted appellant its right to cure\n\nthe defect. At the cost of repetition, the Arbitral Tribunal, as held in catena\n\nof judgments, has held that when a proceeding is filed by company with\n\ndefective board resolution or even without any board resolution at all, is not\n\nfatal and must be permitted to be cured. Procedural defect which do not go\n\nto the root of the matter should not be permitted to defeat a just cause.\n\nThere is sufficient power in the Arbitral Tribunal to ensure that injustice is\n\nnot done to any party who has a just case. As far as possible a substantive\n\nright should not be allowed to be defeated on account of a procedural\n\nirregularity which is curable. If we take away that power then no arbitrator\n\nwill have power to ensure injustice is not done. This is the law and it is this\n\nlaw which had been applied by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nMeera Jadhav\n\n::: Uploaded on - 02/05/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 03/05/2023 14:49:46 :::\n\n37/38 COMAPL-36947-22.doc\n\nThe Claim has been filed by a company incorporated in BVI, which\n\nholds 49% shares in Respondent No. 6 together with RA Group and PA\n\nGroup. Appellant has participated in the arbitral proceedings since 2018.\n\nThe relationship between the parties goes as far back as 25 th March 2009\n\nwhen the share purchase agreement was entered into. It is in these\n\ncircumstances, it is difficult even to presume that the claim has been filed\n\nand arbitral proceedings pursued without appellant having authorised the\n\ninstitution of the same.

In his cross examination by Counsel for\n\nRespondent No. 6, Sunil Jain has deposed that he has attended many\n\nmeetings of Respondent No. 6 after his appointment as Director of\n\nRespondent No. 6 in January 2010. The substance of the dispute is for the\n\ncontrol of Respondent No. 6 between Appellant and the RA Group / PA\n\nGroup. Despite that RA Group has raised such objections.\n\nInfact Mr. Haresh Jagtiani himself has admitted while cross examining\n\nSunil Jain that Sunil Jain was the nominee Director of Appellant in\n\nRespondent No. 6.
