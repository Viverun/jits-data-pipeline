No.25003/2023\n\naside the Arbitral Award dated 06.07.2023 passed by the\n\nlearned Sole Arbitrator.\n\n 2. The plaintiff Mr.H.L.Nagaraj had invoked the\n\nArbitration Agreement and preferred certain Claims against\n\n\"M/s.Siddhshekha Developers LLP\" the defendant No.1.\n\n 3. The Brief facts leading to the case are as follows:-\n\n The plaintiff (owner) seeks a direction to the defendnat\n\nNo.1 (developer) to pay to the plaintiff a sum of\n\nRs.47,46,17,454/- as compensation and in the alternative to\n\ndirect the defendant No.1 to hand over to the plaintiff 39,551\n\nsq ft of Super-Built-Up area in the schedule property. This\n\nprayer is based mainly on the ground of inordinate delay on\n\nthe part of the developer in completing the project in\n\nquestion.\n\n The project is construction of a multi-storied residential\n\ncomplex in property bearing No.98, Bull Temple Road,\n\nBasavanagudi, Bengaluru, measuring 27,475 sq ft (schedule\n\n 4\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nproperty). In this regard, the plaintiff and the defendant\n\nNo.1 entered into a registered Development Agreement on\n\n22.10.2012 ('DA' for short). As per the terms of the said\n\nagreement, the defendant No.1 was authorized to enter upon\n\nthe schedule property for the construction of development\n\nand both the parties agreed to share the built-up area in the\n\nratio 50:50. On the same date of the agreement, a power of\n\nattorney (POA) was also executed by the plaintiff in favour of\n\nthe defendant No.1. Yet another agreement viz.,\n\nsupplementary agreement (SA) was also executed on the\n\nsame day and it was agreed that the defendant No.1 would\n\npay Rs.10 crores non-refundable deposit and Rs.15 crores\n\nrefundable deposit to the claimant.\n\n It is the case of the plaintiff that the defendant No.1\n\nattributed the delay in commencing the construction work, to\n\nthe loan taken by the plaintiff and the schedule property is\n\nsubject matter of proceedings before the Debt Recovery\n\nTribunal, Bengaluru (DRT). The defendant No.1 failed to pay\n\n 5\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthe amount as agreed, to the plaintiff, to enable the plaintiff\n\nto settle the amounts due to IDBI Bank. The defendant No.1\n\nhad no funds to pay to the plaintiff the refundable and non-\n\nrefundable deposits and to start the construction work. As\n\nand when the amounts were paid to the plaintiff by the\n\ndefendant No.1, the plaintiff in turn cleared the entire loan\n\namounts of IDBI Bank and obtained original title deeds of\n\nthe schedule property and handed over the same to the\n\ndefendant No.1.\n\n It is the case of the plaintiff that there was no order of\n\nany nature to prevent the defendant No.1 from obtaining\n\nnecessary sanctions and permissions for putting up the\n\nconstruction and it is the defendant No.1 who had\n\nintroduced Sri.Shailesh Kumar.S.Haran the partner of the\n\ndefendant No.1 and Sri.Pratik Mehta, the partner of\n\nM/s.Unishire Builtech LLP (for short 'Unishire') as its\n\nbusiness associates and friends and agreed to develop the\n\nschedule property. Later on, it was only the defendant No.1\n\n 6\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nwho came forward to develop the project. It is the plaintiff's\n\nstand that the above mentioned Shailesh Kumar in collusion\n\nwith Pratik Mehta instigated the latter to file a frivolous suit\n\non behalf of M/s.Unishire with an intent to delay the project\n\nand to buy the time. When the plaintiff came to know of it,\n\nthe case was withdrawn voluntarily by M/s.Unishire.\n\n It is then stated in para-11 of the suit that on account\n\nof certain differences between the parties a suit was filed\n\nearlier before the present Arbitrator and a compromise was\n\nentered into before the said Arbitrator and thereafter the\n\nparties entered into a Sharing Agreement with respect to the\n\nshares in terms of the Development Agreement. It is clearly\n\nstated in the Sharing Agreement that the terms of the\n\nDevelopment Agreement are intact and shall not be deemed\n\nto a waiver of any of the rights of the parties on account of\n\nsigning the Sharing Agreement dated 1.7.2017.\n\n The averments at para-13 of the suit are in connection\n\nwith the delay on the part of the defendant No.1 in\n\n 7\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncompleting the project and the terms of the Development\n\nAgreement being violated and further many of the works still\n\nremaining to be completed. The said works are tiles not\n\nbeing laid in the flats, development works not complete in\n\ncommon area, plastering and painting work not done inside\n\nthe flats, electrical fittings not installed in flats and common\n\nareas, no sanitary fittings being installed in the flats and in\n\nthe common area, no water connection provided to the flats\n\nand drainage pipes not being connected to the BWSSB\n\npipes. Apart from this, the plaintiff has also mentioned that\n\nthe work was to be completed within 30 months from\n\n22.10.2012 with additional grace period of 6 months with\n\ndamages and there was no virtual completion of the owners\n\nshare of the flats and even as on the date of the suit, the\n\nconstruction has not been completed in terms of the\n\nDevelopment Agreement.\n\n It is the further case of the plaintiff that in collusion\n\nwith the BBMP authorities, the defendant No.1 has obtained\n\n 8\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nOccupancy Certificate (OC) on 5.12.2020. The plaintiff\n\npreferred Writ Petition before the Hon'ble High Court of\n\nKarnataka challenging the OC and the court observed that\n\nthe OC is contrary to the established Bye-laws and following\n\nthis and other observations, the plaintiff withdrew the writ\n\npetition. The defendant No.1 called upon the plaintiff to pay\n\na sum of Rs.11,12,90,253/-. This claim is frivolous one\n\nbecause the question of refund will arise only if the\n\ndefendant No.1 completes the project in virtual manner and\n\nobtains a certificate from the Architect. No such certificate\n\nfrom the Architect has been obtained.\n\n The next averment in the suit is with respect to the\n\nRERA 2016 and according to the plaintiff if there is delay by\n\nthe developer in completing the project within the time\n\nagreed, the developer will have to compensate the plaintiff\n\nas per RERA Rules. The plaintiff did insist on the payment\n\nof damages by the defendant No.1 not only for the delay in\n\n 9\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncompletion of the project but also for not achieving the\n\nmaximum FAR.\n\n It is contended at para 18 that the defendant No.1 is\n\nliable to pay crores of rupees to the plaintiff and on coming\n\nto know that the defendant No.1 is interfering with the\n\nmarketing of the flats allotted to the plaintiff, a suit was\n\nfiled\n u/S 9 (1) (I) (d)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 in AA 2533/2021 before the City Civil Court. Both\n\nparties have filed joint memo, undertaking not to alienate 9\n\nflats fallen to the share of each.\n\n Nextly, it is contended that on account of the delay in\n\nthe project, the defendant No.1 failed to achieve the\n\nmaximum FAR and instead of achieving 4.8 FAR the\n\ndefendant No.1 achieved only 4.19 FAR. The reduction in\n\nthe FAR has led to loss of 8,379 sq ft to the plaintiff which in\n\nterms of amount, works out to Rs.10,04,48,000/-. The\n\nplaintiff brought this to the notice of the defendant No.1 vide\n\nlegal notice dated 23.6.2021 and called upon the defendant\n\n 10\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nNo.1 to pay to the plaintiff Rs.40,60,66,400/- and to hand\n\nover 33,839 sq ft of super built up area in the schedule\n\nproperty.\n\n On the basis of the afore stand taken and contending\n\nthat RERA is applicable to the project in question, on account\n\nof the delay on the part of the defendant No.1 in completing\n\nthe project, the plaintiff has sought for a sum of\n\nRs.47,46,17,454/- at para 24 of the suit giving the details of\n\nthe said amount. It is then contended at para 26 that\n\nthough the plaintiff offered to pay Rs.7,50,00,000/- to the\n\ndefendant No.1 by way of demand draft, the defendant No.1\n\nfailed to receive the same and on account of the delay on the\n\npart of the defendant No.1, the plaintiff could not clear his\n\nliability to the builder of a shopping complex at Dubai. The\n\nplaintiff also suffered opportunity in Dubai and the financial\n\nloss is Rs.42 crores on account of the plaintiff having to\n\nsurrender the commercial complex purchased.\n\n 11\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n Stating that, the plaintiff on the assurance of the\n\ndefendant No.1 that the construction work would be\n\ncompleted before May 2021, executed a sale deed on\n\n25.1.2021 in respect of Flat NO.1102 to Smt.Rajul Devi and\n\non account of the delay in completion of the construction\n\nwork by the defendant No.1, the plaintiff is paying damages\n\naround Rs.4,16,000/- every month to the said purchaser as\n\nper RERA Rules. The defendant No.1 is trying to alienate\n\nthe remaining flats fallen to its share and stating all these\n\nfactors from para 26 onwards, the plaintiff has prayed for\n\nthe reliefs as mentioned in the very 1st para of this suit.\n\n 4. Being aggrieved by the said Arbitral Award, the\n\nPetitioner has challenged the same on several grounds,\n\nwhich will be discussed later in the body of the Judgment.\n\n 5. The defendant No.1 has filed a detailed Statement\n\nof Objections/Written Statement on 25.10.2023 and he\n\nprayed to dismiss the said application. The defendant No.2\n\n 12\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nnot appeared before the court, hence he placed exparte and\n\nthe defendant No.1 prayed to dismiss the said application.\n\n 6. I have heard the arguments of the Advocate for the\n\nplaintiff Sri.S.K.M.Mithun, and the arguments of the\n\nAdvocate for the defendant No. 1 Sri.Kamalachari. The\n\nAdvocate for the plaintiff has filed Written Arguments on\n\n29.07.2024. The Advocate for the defendant No.1 has filed\n\nwritten arguments on 29.07.2024.\n\n 7. Based on the above contentions of both parties,\n\nfollowing Points arise for my consideration:-\n\n 1. Whether there are grounds to\n set aside the Impugned Award\n under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration & Conciliation\n Act?\n\n 2. What order?\n\n 8. My findings on the above points are as follows:-\n\n Point No.1:- In the Negative,\n\n Point No.2:- As per the final Order,\n for the following:-\n\n 13\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n REASONS\n\n 9. Point No.1: The plaintiff has preferred a claim\n\npetition before the Learned Arbitrator for claiming\n\nRs.47,46,17,454/- against the defendant and in the\n\nalternative direct the defendant to hand over to the plaintiff\n\n39,551 sq.ft., of super built up area in the schedule property\n\nmainly on the ground that inordinate delay on the part of the\n\ndeveloper in completing the project in question.\n\n 10. The learned Arbitrator has rejected the claim\n\npetition and allowed the counter claim of the defendant in\n\npart.\n\n 11. The plaintiff has challenged the said Impugned\n\nAward in this proceeding. The Hon'ble High Court in the\n\nJudgment dated 17.04.2021 in Com. A.P.No.25/2021 (Union\n\nof India vs. M/s Warsaw Engineers), has laid down certain\n\nguidelines/principles about the writing of Judgments in a\n\nPetition filed under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\n 14\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nConciliation Act\n. Keeping in my mind the said guidelines, I\n\nnow propose to examine each and every ground urged by\n\nthe Petitioner specifically with reference to the submissions\n\nmade by both Advocates.\n\n 12. The First ground is that the Tribunal erred in\n\nholding that there is no delay on the part of the defendant\n\nNo.1 in construction in spite of coming to conclusion in para-\n\n69 of the Award that there is roughly 4 years delay in\n\nobtaining sanctioned plan.\n\n 12.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner has\n\nargued that impugned award is contrary to \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act. Since, most of the\n\ncontentions put forth by the petitioner have been rejected\n\nwithout any reason. This is the violative of public policy on\n\nthis delay point alone award is liable to be set aside.\n\n 12.b. I have perused award passed by the sole\n\narbitrator in award para No.63 to 75 the Hon'ble Arbitrator\n\n 15\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ndiscussed delay aspect looking to the terms of the Ex.P.1\n\nand Ex.P.3 and other document and based on evidence and\n\nbased on facts and circumstances of the case and came to\n\nthe conclusion that there is no delay on the part of the\n\ndefendant No.1 in construction of the building.\n\n 12.c. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n \n12.d. In the present case the learned Arbitrator has\n\ngiven cogent reasons and made detailed discussions in the\n\npara-67 of the Award and as per Ex.P.1 clause-4 (1) (a) clear\n\nthat the developer/respondent to obtain sanction plan within\n\n6 months from the date of joint development agreement; i.e.,\n\n22.10.2012. Further the Award stated that if the delay is\n\ndue to any act or clog on the title of the owner/petitioner\n\nsame is to be excluded. Further, he has framed 17 Issues\n\nand P.W.1 and R.W.1 examined and Ex.P.1 to 29 and Ex.R.1\n\n 16\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nto R.88 (a) documents are got marked and made discussions\n\nIssue wise and has given finding on each Issue by\n\ndiscussing the same in detail. At any stretch of imagination,\n\nit can be considered that it is not a reasoned order as\n\ncontended by the Petitioner. Further, in this aspect, it is to be\n\nnoted that in the decision reported in A.I.R. - 1988 - S.C. -\n\n1340 (\nIndian Oil Corporation vs. Indian Carbon Ltd\n), it is\n\nheld as follows:-\n\n\"It is one thing to say that reasons should be stated and\n\nanother thing to state that a detailed judgment is to be given\n\nin support of an award. Even if it be held it is obligatory to\n\nstate the reason, it is not obligatory to give a detailed\n\njudgment\".\n\n \n12.e. A similar view was also taken by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in the decision reported in A.I.R. - 1989 -\n\nS.C. - 973 (\nGujarat Water Supply vs. Unique Erectors\n).\n\n 17\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n12.f. Similar views were expressed by Full Bench (5\n\nHon'ble Judges Bench) of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\n\ndecision reported in A.I.R. - 1991 - S.C. - 2089 (\nGoa, Daman\n\n& Diu Housing Board vs. Ramakant V.P. Darvotkar\n),\n\nwherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as follows:-\n\n\"There is however nothing to show that the awards have\n\nbeen improperly procured. There is no allegation, far less,\n\nany finding, that the Arbitrator was biased or unfair or he\n\nhas not heard both the parties or he has not fairly\n\nconsidered the submission of the parties in making the\n\naward in question. In our opinion, it is evident from the four\n\nawards made by the Arbitrator, that the Arbitrator has\n\nconsidered the submission of the parties in making the\n\naward in question. In our opinion, it is evident from the four\n\nawards made by the Arbitrator, that the Arbitrator has\n\nconsidered all the relevant issues raised by the parties in\n\nthe Arbitrator proceedings and came to his finding after\n\ngiving cogent reasons. The above award cannot under any\n\n 18\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncircumstances be considered to be made by the Arbitrator\n\nwithout recording any reasons for the same. Therefore, in\n\nsuch circumstances, it is not proper to hold that the\n\nArbitrator has misconducted himself or the proceedings in\n\nthe matter of giving the awards\".\n\n 12.g. In another decision reported in 2014 (9) - S.C.C.\n\n- 212 (\nAnand Brothers Private Limited vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers\n), at Para No. 12 has considered and decided the\n\nphrase 'finding' and in Para No. 13 defined the phrase\n\n\"conclusion\" and further regarding the finding and speaking\n\norder the Hon'ble Apex Court at Para No. 14 has held as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"It is trite that a finding can be both; a finding of fact or a\n\nfinding of law........This is the rule also in the case of finding\n\nof fact where too the process of reasoning must be disclosed\n\nin order that it is accepted as a finding in the sense the\n\nexpression is used in Clause 70\".\n\n 19\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 12.h. By considering the ratio of the above-mentioned\n\ndecisions, in the present case, the learned Arbitrator has\n\ngiven cogent reasons and made detailed discussions in the\n\nImpugned Award. Therefore, in view of the ratio of the\n\naforesaid decisions, it has to be examined by perusing of the\n\nImpugned Award wherein the learned Arbitrator dealt with\n\neach and every claim separately and recorded the reasoning\n\nfor allowing or disallowing the claim. Hence, as per the ratio\n\nof the above decisions, the said contentions of the Petitioner\n\ncannot be accepted. The award cannot be set aside on the\n\nsaid ground. Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Subsection (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 13. The Second ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact the defendant No.1 had been given\n\n 20\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nirrevocable authorization to enter 'A' schedule property vide\n\nEx.P.1 for the purpose of construction.\n\n 13.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner has\n\nargued that the impugned award is in contravention to the\n\nEx.P.1. Award being contrary to the Ex.P.1, same is to be\n\ninterfered with this ground, same is illegal opposed to public\n\npolicy.\n\n 13.b. On perusal of Ex.P.1 the terms between the\n\nparties, it cannot be held that the learned Arbitrator is\n\ncompletely ignored the term of Ex.P.1 and traversed beyond\n\nall the terms of the contract while interpreting the same.\n\n 13.c. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n 13.d. The learned Advocate for the defendant No.1\n\nhas argued that the defendant No.1 has completed the\n\n 21\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nworks as per agreements and claimed the amount in\n\naccordance with agreed terms, that there is no evidence on\n\nrecord to show that the plaintiff has raised any objection\n\nwith regard to the work completed by the defendant No.1.\n\n 13.e. The learned Advocate for the plaintiff by\n\nreferring to the Cross-examination of DW.1 has argued that\n\nthe DW.1 has admitted that there is no obstacle to enter into\n\nthe premises and there is authorization to enter the suit\n\nschedule 'A' property.\n\n 13.f. Therefore an award warrants interference by\n\nthe court u/S 34 of the Aribtration and Conciliation Act only\n\nwhen it contravenes a substantive provision of law or patent\n\nillegal or shocks the conscious of the court and that plausible\n\nor reasonable view taken by the Arbitrator even if same is\n\nbased on insufficient evidence is not substituted by the\n\ncourt. Hence, this ground is not available for the petitioner\n\nunder Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge\n\n 22\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nflanked by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 13.g. The scheme of the Act, when seen as a whole,\n\nis to minimise the interference by the courts during the\n\narbitration proceedings. That is why \nSection 5\n specifically\n\nprohibits any judicial authority to intervene in the arbitration\n\nproceedings, notwithstanding anything contained in the\n\nother law for the time being in force, in matters governed by\n\nPart I of the Act\n except to the extent provided for in the Act.\n\nThe aforesaid scheme is also evident from \nSections 13\n and\n\n16\n of the Act, which provide that issues relating to challenge\n\nto the arbitral tribunal on grounds of justifiable doubt,\n\ncompetence (qualification), and jurisdiction of the tribunal\n\ncannot be agitated midway when the arbitral proceedings\n\nare on, and such challenges should await the making of the\n\naward by the tribunal.\"\n\n \n13.h. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision reported\n\nin (2018) 9 - S.C.C. 49 (\nEmkay Global Financial Services\n\n 23\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nLtd. vs. Girdhar Sondhi\n) has held that an application under\n\nSection 34\n of the Act for setting aside an arbitral award will\n\nnot ordinarily require anything beyond the record that was\n\nbefore the arbitrator. I, have carefully perused the arbitral\n\nrecord and it is observed that as per \nSection 19(2)\n of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, no procedure between the\n\nparties was agreed to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in\n\nconducting its proceedings. It is further observed that the\n\nlearned Arbitrator rightfully exercised the power vested in\n\nhim under the mandate of \nSection 19(3)\n and \n19(4)\n of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act. Hence, the arbitral award is\n\nneither against the fundamental policy of India nor in\n\ncontravention of law. Thus, the challenge by the respondent\n\ncalling for the setting aside of arbitral award on this count is\n\nrejected.\n\n 14. The Third ground is that in para-69 of the award\n\nhas erred in coming to the conclusion the possession of the\n\n 24\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nschedule 'A' property was handed over to the defendant\n\nNo.1 vide Ex.P.4.\n\n 14.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat the possession of the schedule 'A' property has handed\n\nover to the defendant No.1 vide Ex.P.4. Without any base\n\ntribunal came to wrong conclusion. It is to be noted that in\n\npara-69 of the award the suit came to be disposed on\n\n16.10.2015. Thus, challenge to the title of the owner is\n\nremoved only in the year 2015 and possession of the\n\nschedule property was handed over to the developer by the\n\nowner as per agreement dated 20.7.2013 as per Ex.P.4. So,\n\nArbitrator rightly given finding on that aspect. Therefore,\n\nthere are no grounds to accept the said contention. Herein\n\nthis ground is not available for the petitioner. Hence, this\n\nground is not available for the Petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-Section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\n 25\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nfor the setting aside of Arbitral Award on this count is\n\nrejected.\n\n 15. The Fourth ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the law \nlaid down in\n AIR 2000 SC 2633 and\n\n2008 (6) SCC 745. When the terms of the registered\n\ndocument cannot be altered by way of unregistered\n\ndocument.\n\n 15.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat registered document cannot be altered by way of\n\nunregistered document.\n\n 15.b. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe plaintiff is bound to all terms and conditions of the\n\nagreements and cannot subsequently choose the defence\n\nthat subsequent agreement is unregistered the terms of the\n\nagreement which is/are favourable or suits them to\n\ncircumvent his legal obligation arising out of the agreement.\n\nThe plaintiff understood the disputed involved in the\n\n 26\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\narbitration proceedings filed pleadings produced oral as well\n\nas documentary evidence fully participated in the arbitration\n\nproceedings without any objection in the arbitration\n\nproceedings, now he raised objection challenged the plaintiff\n\nis estopped from raising such a contention in this\n\nproceeding.\n\n \n15.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\n 27\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 16. The Fifth ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that Mr.Pratik Mehta is the partner of the\n\ndefendant No.1.\n\n 16.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner has\n\nargued that tribunal failed to appreciate fact that Mr.Pratik\n\nMehta is the partner of the defendant No.1.\n\n 16.b. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n \n16.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n 28\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 17. The Sixth Ground is the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that if there was any issue from\n\n 29\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nM/s.Unishire the defendant No.1 would not have entered\n\ninto Ex.P.1 and parted amount to the plaintiff.\n\n 17.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that if there was\n\nany issue from M/s.Unishire the defendant No.1 would not\n\nhave entered into Ex.P.1 and parted amount to the plaintiff.\n\n \n17.b. This ground is in the nature of ground to be\n\nurged in the appeal. In order to answer this ground I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1 & 3, which is not permissible\n\nunder law. The position in law is well settled that this court\n\nwhile exercising power\n u/s 34\n of the Act does not sit as a\n\ncourt of appeal. The nature of proceeding is summary in\n\nnature. is summary in nature as held in the decision\n\nreported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -\n\nS.C.C. - 462 (\nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n).\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under\n\nSub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the\n\n 30\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 18. The Seventh ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the evidence of P.W.1 wherein the plaintiff has\n\ncategorically stated in the suit of the M/s.Unishire is a\n\ncollusive suit instigated by the defendant No.1 to buy time\n\nfor construction and it is not challenged by the defendant\n\nNo.1.\n\n 18.a. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n 18.b. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n 31\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings.\n\n 18.c. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n \n18.d. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\n 32\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 19. The Eighth ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that suit of M/s.Unishire vide Ex.R.7\n\nnever an impediment for the defendant No.1 to obtain plan\n\nsanctioned and start construction.\n\n 19.a. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n 19.b. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. Section 34 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n 33\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings.\n\n 19.c. In this regard the Hon'ble Arbitrator in para-69\n\nof the Award observed that, the schedule property was the\n\nsubject matter of the suit and the suit came to be disposed\n\noff only in 2015. Therefore, challenged to the title of the\n\nowner was removed only in the year 2015 and perusal of\n\nthe Ex.P.1 Joint Development Agreement Page-21 and 22\n\nand r/w clause-b of joint development agreement Ex.P.1\n\npage-33.\n\n 19.d. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\n 34\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\n \n19.e. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 35\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 20. The Ninth ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that during the pendency of O.S.\n\nNo.27119/2012 the defendant No.1 had started excavation\n\nmade payment to IDBI Bank and made payment to the\n\nplaintiff, hence finding of the defendant No.2 the O.S.\n\nNo.27119/2012 will be clog as per clause-4 (i) (a) of Ex.P.1\n\nis in conflict with most basic notions of morality and justice\n\nas per \nSec.34 (2) (b) (ii)\n of Arbitration and Conciliation Act\n\nand hence award has to be set aside.\n\n 20.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that during the\n\npendency of O.S. No.27119/2012 the defendant No.1 has\n\nstarted the excavation made payment to the IDBI Bank and\n\nmade payment to the plaintiff. Hence, award is violative of\n\nSection 34 of the Aribtration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 36\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 20.b. Here in this case, clause-4 (i) (a) of Ex.P.1 in\n\npage No.11, which reads thus:\n\n\"The Developer/Respondent shall get the requisite plans,\n\ndrawings, designs etc., for construction of multi storied\n\ncomplex prepared as per the building Byelaws, Rules and\n\nRegulations that shall be in force from time to time and\n\nobtain due sanction of the plan/s, license from BBMP and\n\nor any other competent local authority within six months\n\nfrom this date. If the delay is due to any act of omission or\n\ncomm ission on the part of the Owner/Petitioner or for the\n\nreason of clog on the title of the Owner/Petitioner, the same\n\nshall be excluded for this purpose. The Owner/Petitioner\n\nshall co-operate fully in this regard by signing all forms,\n\napplications, bonds, affidavits and or any other papers as\n\nmay be sought for/required by the Developer/Respondent\n\nand or any authority.\"\n\n 37\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 20.c. And perusal of the para-71 of the Award\n\nobserve that clause-1 of Ex.P.3 the mode and timeline in\n\nwhich the loans are to be cleared by the owner/petitioner.\n\n \n20.d. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 38\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 21. The Tenth ground is that the Tribunal in para-70\n\nof the Award has erred in coming to conclusion that\n\npossession of the suit schedule 'A' property was handed\n\nover to defendant No.1 vide Ex.P.4 and excluding period till\n\nEx.P.4 is contrary to the terms of Ex.P.1. Further contrary to\n\nthe law laid and reasoning given in Award is contrary to the\n\nbasic law and as such is in contravention with fundamental\n\npolicy of Indian Law and is in conflict with most basic\n\nnotions of justice.\n\n 21.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat the tribunal in para-70 of the award has erred in\n\ncoming to conclusion that possession of the suit 'A' property\n\nwas handed over to the defendant No.1 vide Ex.P.4 and\n\nreasoning to contrary to the law.\n\n 39\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 21.b. Perusal of the records and according to JDA,\n\ntotal period for completion of project within 30 months + 6\n\nadditional months, from date of issuance of commencement\n\ncertificate. Commencement Certificate issued on\n\n19.01.2017. Period of completion as per JDA: 18.01.2020.\n\nCompletion Certificate: 10.10.2019. Therefore,\n\nDeveloper/Respondent has completed the project well before\n\n18.01.2020. With reference to the clauses of Ex.P.1,\n\ndocuments marked in evidence, the question of delay in the\n\nconstruction on part of the developer does not arise.\n\n \n21.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\n 40\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 22. The Eleventh Ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nnotice that Ex.R.41 is not issued by the building Architect\n\nand Tribunal failed to notice that as per terms of the Ex.P.1\n\nclause-2 (a) (i) (iii) the building Architect has to issue the\n\ncompletion certificate not by any third party Architect.\n\n \n22.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n 41\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 23. The Twelveth Ground is that the Tribunal at para-\n\n70 of the Award erred in coming to conclusion that the\n\nbuilding is complete as on 18.01.2020 in spite of plaintiff\n\nproducing Ex.P.6, P.29 photographs and Ex.P.23 and P.24\n\nwhich clearly discloses the construction in the building is\n\n 42\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nstill in process and the building was not facilitated with\n\nwater connection and power connection and said documents\n\nare not in dispute. The Tribunal coming to the conclusion\n\nthat the building was completed by 18.01.2020 is totally in\n\nconflict with basic notion of justice.\n\n \n23.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\n 43\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 24. The Thirteenth Ground is that the Tribunal erred\n\nin not appreciating the fact that as on the date of Ex.P.1 the\n\nloan amount outstanding payable to IDBI Bank is only\n\nRs.12.3 Crores and loan account of the plaintiff was\n\nregularized and same is evident Ex.P.20 the Tribunal in\n\npara-79 of the Award has wrongly come to the conclusion\n\nthat the loan amount is Rs.22 Crores.\n\n 24.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner has\n\nargued that arbitrator not looked Ex.P.1 & 2 and made\n\nwrong award.\n\n 24.b. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\n 44\n\n \nA.S. No.25003/2023\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 25. The Fourteenth Ground is that the Tribunal has\n\nfailed to appreciate the fact that JDA was entered into clear\n\nloan of IDBI Bank, Sheriff Constructions loan and to meet\n\nother financial commitments of the plaintiff, the defendant\n\n 45\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nNo.2 coming to conclusion that plaintiff has to pay\n\nRs.1,06,00,000/- towards interest is illegal.\n\n 25.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted\n\nthat the tribunal has not appreciated the fact that JDA was\n\nentered into clear loan of IDBI Bank, Shariff Constructions\n\nloan and to meet other financial commitments of the plaintiff.\n\nBut, the Arbitrator held that plaintiff has to pay interest is\n\nillegal one.\n\n 25.b. In Award para No.72, it is held that Ex.R.3 has\n\nnot been disputed by the owner/petitioner. From Ex.R.2\n\nand R.3, it is clearly established that developer/respondent\n\nhas paid the monies to IDBI and also Sheriff Constructions.\n\nPayments were made through DD and/or RTGS, hence,\n\nexcess of Rs.1.06 crores was paid towards interst. In\n\nAward Para No.73, it is held that owner/petitioner has not\n\nplaced any proof or evidence of having paid Rs.7.5 crores\n\nwithin one year from the date of the last instalment to IDBI\n\n 46\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nand another amount of Rs.7.5 crores within 6 weeks from\n\nthe developer/respondent obtaining completion certificate.\n\n \n25.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 47\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 26. The Fifteenth Ground is that the Tribunal has\n\nerred in not appreciating the fact that it was the defendant\n\nNo.1 insisted the plaintiff to seek the time from the IDBI\n\nBank to repay the loan and now holding the plaintiff to pay\n\nthe interest amount is illegal.\n\n 26.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 14th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 27. The Sixteenth Ground is that the plaintiff out of\n\nthe Rs.8 Crore paid under Ex.P.1 has repaid the M/s.Sheriff\n\n 48\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nConstruction loan upon the instructions of defendant No.1,\n\nhence finding of the defendant No.2 the Rs.8 Crores should\n\nhave been paid to the IDBI Bank is incorrect.\n\n 27.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat the plaintiff out of the Rs.8 Crore paid under Ex.P.1 has\n\nrepaid the M/s.Sheriff Construction loan upon the\n\ninstructions of defendant No.1, hence finding of the\n\ndefendant No.2 the Rs.8 Crores should have been paid to\n\nthe IDBI Bank is incorrect.\n\n \n27.b. As per Ex.P.1 the plaintiff out of Rs.8 crore paid\n\nunder Ex.P.1 has repaid M/s.Shariff Construction loan upon\n\nthe instruction of the defendant No.1. This fact is ignored by\n\nthe arbitrator. With this background if this ground is read\n\nthis ground is in the nature of and tenor of appeal. In order\n\nto answer this ground I have to make reappreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\n 49\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 28. The Seventeenth Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nerred in para-72 of the Award that the respondent has paid\n\ninterest, because the respondent wanted time to repay the\n\nloan of IDBI Bank. Hence, holding that plaintiff is liable to\n\npay interest is illegal and is in conflict with most basic\n\nnotions of morality and justice as per \nSec.34 (2) (b) (ii)\n of\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 50\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 28.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 14th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 29. The Eighteenth Ground is that the Tribunal in\n\nspite of knowing that flats are handed over to the plaintiff in\n\nthe month of August and October 2022 and holding that\n\nthere is no delay on part of defendant No.1 is absolutely is\n\nin conflict with most basic notion of morality and justice as\n\nper \nSec.34 (2) (b) (ii)\n of Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 29.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot\n\naccept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence, this\n\nground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)\n\n 51\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 30. The Twentieth Ground is that the Tribunal in para\n\n74 of the Award has stated the factors which lead to delay\n\non the part of the developer is contrary to records and\n\nevidence and is in conflict with the basic notions of morality\n\nand justice as per \nSec.34 (2) (b) (ii)\n of Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act.\n\n 30.a. In Arbitral award in para No.74 it is observed\n\nthat the other factors that leads to the inference that there is\n\nno delay on part of the developer/respondent are writ\n\npetition filed by the neighbours to the schedule property and\n\nthe consequent writ appeal filed, which was dismissed only\n\nin 2018.\n\n 52\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 30.b. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot\n\naccept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence, this\n\nground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)\n\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 31. The Twenty-First Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nerred in not understanding the fact that the plaintiff entered\n\ninto JDA with an intent to clear IDBI loan, Sheriff\n\nConstructions loan and other personal loans and also save\n\nhis properties in Dubai and holding that para 75 of the\n\nAward the time is not essence of the agreement is in conflict\n\nwith the most basic notions of morality and justice as per\n\nSec.34 (2)(b)(ii)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 31.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued\n\nthat the tribunal in para-75 of the award wrongly held that\n\n 53\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ntime is not the essence of the agreement and it is against the\n\nprinciple of law.\n\n 31.b. It is observed that time is not the essence of the\n\ncontract and I have perused clause (4) (i) (c) of JDA. It states\n\nthat the developer/respondent shall commence the\n\nconstruction immediately after obtaining the building plans\n\nduly approved in terms of this agreement and complete the\n\nconstruction within 30 months from the date of obtaining\n\ncommencement certificate from the planning authority,\n\nsubject to delay that might be caused by unforeseen\n\nincidents like litigation, scarcity of materials, or acts of God.\n\nHowever, the owner/petitioner does hereby agree to provide\n\nan additional period of six months to the\n\ndeveloper/respondent to complete the project, which the\n\ndeveloper/respondent may need due to any unforeseen\n\nfactors/developments. Completion of construction in this\n\nregard means virtual completion. Virtual completion means\n\nthe owner/petitioner share of flats shall be in habitable\n\n 54\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncondition. In the event of delay on the part of the developer/\n\nrespondent to complete the construction as above, the\n\ndeveloper/respondent will be liable to pay a sum of Rs.15/-\n\nper sq.ft., of saleable super built up area falling to the share\n\nof the owner/petitioner. However, if the delay is beyond 12\n\nmonths from the stipulated period the owner/petitioner shall\n\nbe liberty to take over the project and complete the project at\n\nthe cost of the owner/petitioner deductible from the\n\ndeveloper/respondent's share of construction.\" Insertion of\n\npenalty clauses and additional period of 6 months are all\n\nindicative of the fact that the time is not the essence of the\n\nagreement between the parties. Hon'ble supreme Court, in\n\nthe case of Chandrani v/s Kamalrani (1993) 1 SCC 519 held\n\nthat the stipulation of the time is the essence of the contract\n\nwill have to be read along with other terms of the contract.\n\nIf clauses provide an extension of time under certain\n\ncontengencies or if there are clauses for payment of fines or\n\npenalty for every day or week, such clauses would render\n\nthe provision relating to time being of the essence,\n\n 55\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nineffective. Therefore, the developer/respondent cannot be\n\nheld responsible for the delay in the completion of the\n\nproject.\n\n \n31.c. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 56\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 32. The Twenty-Second Ground is that the Tribunal in\n\npara 74 of the award has stated the factors which lead to\n\ndelay in on the part of the developer is contrary to records\n\nand evidence and is in conflict with the most basic notions of\n\nmorality and justice as per \nSec.34 (2)(b)(ii)\n of Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act.\n\n 32.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot\n\naccept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence, this\n\nground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)\n\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge flanked by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 57\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 33. The Twenty-Third Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nerred in not understanding the fact that the plaintiff entered\n\ninto JDA with an intent to clear IDBI loan, Sheriff\n\nConstructions loan and other personal loans and also save\n\nhis properties in Dubai and holding that para-75 of the\n\naward the time is not essence of the agreement is in conflict\n\nwith the most basic notions of morality and justice as per\n\nSec.34 (2)(b)(ii)\n of Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 33.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 21st ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 34. The Twenty-forth Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nerred in not appreciating the fact that as per Clause 4 (a)\n\n 58\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nand 4 (c) of Ex.P.1, wherein it is categorically stated that the\n\ndefendant No.1 has to obtain sanction plan within 6 months\n\nfrom 22.10.2012 and immediately after obtaining plan\n\nsanction should complete the construction within 30 months\n\nand completion should be in habitable manner and virtual\n\ncompletion as per the terms of Ex.P.1, by this it is very\n\nevident and clear that the plaintiff and defendant No.1 had\n\nagreed that the time is the essence of the agreement, the\n\ntribunal holding that by unforeseen factors, by unforeseen\n\nincidents and agreement providing extension clauses and\n\npayment of fine or penalty for everyday or week would\n\nabsolve the responsibility of the defendant No.1 from the\n\nterms of the Ex.P.1 is in conflict within terms of JDA and\n\nalso is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality and\n\njustice as per \nSection 34 (2) (b) (iii)\n of Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act.\n\n 34.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 21st ground above. For the same reasons I\n\n 59\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 35. The Twenty-fifth Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nerred in not appreciating the fact that in the sharing\n\nagreement itself which is marked as Ex.P.5 at para 10 it is\n\nclearly stated that Ex.P.5 shall not be a waiver of any rights\n\nof the plaintiff.\n\n 35.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner has\n\ndrawn my attention about Ex.P.5 and has argued that the\n\ntribunal is not appreciating the fact in this case.\n\n \n35.b. On perusal of Ex.P.5 along with submission of\n\nthe advocate for the petitioner is concerned. In order to\n\ninterfere this ground I have to make reappreciation of the\n\n 60\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nevidence admitted before the learned Arbitrator. \nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower\n\nthe Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence\n\nproduced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge\n\nif the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.\n\nThe Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not\n\npermissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\n\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over\n\nhis findings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Act is summary in nature as held in the decision\n\nreported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -\n\nS.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n).\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under\n\nSub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 61\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 36. The Twenty-Sixth Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nerred in not appreciating the fact vide Ex.R.33 Joint Memo\n\nfiled by the both the plaintiff and defendant No.1, it is\n\ncategorically agreed that the plaintiff can seek damages for\n\nthe delayed performance against defendant No.1. The\n\ntribunal still holding that time is not essence of Ex.P.1 and\n\nholding there is no delay is in conflict with the most basic\n\nnotions of morality and justice.\n\n 36.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 21st ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 37. The Twenty-Seventh Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nfailed to appreciate the fact that the defendant No.1 would\n\n 62\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nnot have cleared IDBI Loan amount and would not have\n\nmade further payments to plaintiff if there was any clog over\n\nthe title of the schedule 'A' property.\n\n \n37.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 63\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n \n38. The Twenty-Eighth Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nhas failed to appreciate the fact that the law \nlaid down by\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in 1993 (1) SCC 519 is not applicable\n\nto facts of this case.\n\n 38.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 21st ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 39. The Twenty-Ninth Ground is that the Tribunal\n\nfailed to appreciate the fact that the plaintiff had issued\n\ndemand draft bearing No.504388 dated 27.02.2019 and\n\n 64\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nvide Ex.P.21 email, wherein the plaintiff had stated that he\n\nwould transfer more and proved that they had 7.5 crores\n\nbank balance.\n\n 39.a. This ground is in the nature of a ground to be\n\nurged in an appeal. In order to answer this ground, I have\n\nto reappreciate the Ex.P.1, P.3 & other documents and\n\nevidence on both sides, which is not permissible under law.\n\nUnder Sub-Section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 40. The Thirtieth Ground is that the Tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that the defendant No.1 who took the DD\n\nmentioned above subsequently with a malafide intention\n\nwith ulterior motives to claim super built up area of\n\ndefendant No.1 returned the demand draft.\n\n 65\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n40.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 66\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 41. The thirtifirst ground is that the findings of the\n\ntrial court at para No.73 of the award that the plaintiff failed\n\nto prove that he tried to return Rs.7.5 Crores is in conflict\n\nwith the most basic notions of morality and justice.\n\n 41.a. The learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that\n\ntribunal in para-73 of the award contrary to the law and\n\nfindings are against the principle of \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n \n41.b. There is no positive evidence produced by the\n\npetitioner to show that petitioner has arranged funds of\n\nRs.7.5 crore. So, from the argument of the petitioner and\n\nfrom the argument of the respondent and from the material\n\navailable on record, it requires reappreciation of evidence.\n\nBut, \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 42. The Thirtisecond ground is that the Tribunal erred\n\nin not appreciating the fact that none of the factors stated in\n\nthe para No.74 of the award the plaintiff can be held\n\nresponsible and further no pleadings and evidence or\n\ndocument produced by the defendant No.1 stating plaintiff\n\nintervened in the construction.\n\n 68\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 42.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal patently erred and not appreciating pleading\n\nand evidence before the tribunal and has completely ignored\n\nthe oral and documentary evidence.\n\n \n42.b. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996\n\ndoes not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 43. The Thirtithird ground is that the Tribunal erred in\n\nnot appreciating the fact that when the defendant No.1\n\nexpressed its difficulty in completion of the project plaintiff\n\nbrought M/s.Star Bazar and introduced defendant No.1 and\n\nthe plaintiff suggested to do commercial property, but the\n\ndefendant No.1 refused to do it.\n\n \n43.a.

Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 44. The Thirtifourth ground is that the Tribunal erred\n\nin not appreciating the fact that the plaintiff thought was\n\nvery co-operative and the plaintiff never intervened in any\n\naspects of construction and tribunal coming to conclusion at\n\npara 75 of the award the delay is caused due to conduct of\n\nthe plaintiff is in conflict with the most basic notions of\n\nmorality and justice.\n\n 44.a.

Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 45. The Thirtififth ground is that the Tribunal in para\n\nNo.77 of the award has come to conclusion that the plaintiff\n\nbased on Ex.P.5 sharing agreement is claiming he is an\n\n 72\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nallottee is baseless findings and contrary to provisions of\n\nRERA Act\n.\n\n 45.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal in para-77 of the award come to the conclusion\n\nbased on Ex.P.5 sharing agreement is claiming he is an\n\nallottee is baseless finding.\n\n 45.b. I have perused the Karnataka Real Estate\n\nRegulatory Authority has clarified and confirmed that,\n\nkeeping in mind the objectives of the \nRERA Act, 2016\n the\n\nLand Owners are considered as \"Promoter\" for the said Act.\n\n 45.c. I have perused award No.78 it clearly stated\n\nthat the JDA at Ex.P.1 reveals that, it was an agreement\n\nbetween the owner of the schedule property and the\n\ndeveloper and the Sharing Agreement. Ex.P.5 only speaks\n\nof what flats or units had fallen to the share of the owner\n\nand what had fallen to the share of the developer. Merely\n\nbecause the word 'allotee' in the Schedule 'B' and 'C' is\n\n 73\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nused in the Sharing Agreement Ex.P.5, it does not lead to the\n\nconclusion that the owner is an allottee coming within the\n\ndefinition of the RERA. At best, the owner can be brought\n\nwithin the ambit of a promoter, but he cannot be called as\n\n'allottee' under the RERA.\n\n 45.d. I have perused award No.79 & 80 it clearly\n\nstated that once it is held that the owner/petitioner is not an\n\nallotee, the question of applicability of \nSection 18\n does not\n\narise. RERA is a \nSpecial Act\n and it bars the jurisdiction of\n\nother Courts with regard to adjudication of a mater falling\n\nwithin the RERA. The Tribunal, cannot adjudicate upon the\n\nmatter, which falls within the purview of the authority under\n\nRERA. The jurisdiction of an arbitrator is confined to four\n\ncorners of the reference and in the absence of any specific\n\nprovision in the arbitration agreement.\n\n 45.e. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\n 74\n\n \nA.S. No.25003/2023\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n \n46. The Thirtisixth ground is that the Tribunal erred in\n\nnot applying the law \nlaid down in\n AIR 2021 SC 70 where in\n\nallottees where sanctioned damages more than what is\n\nstipulated in the agreement.\n\n 75\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n46.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 76\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 47. The Thirtiseventh ground is that the defendant\n\nNo.1 who is a promoter as per Ex.P.1 under clause 1 (b) has\n\nagreed to transfer 50% super built up area to plaintiff which\n\nis in accordance with the definition of allottee under \nSection\n\n2 (d)\n of RERA Act. The definition of allottee categorically\n\nstates that if the promoter agrees to transfer flat or plot in\n\nany mode of transfer other than lease the person who is\n\ngetting his share is an allottee the same is canvassed by the\n\nplaintiff before the trial court and also filed written\n\narguments mentioning the same, the tribunal without even\n\nlooking into written arguments and also arguments\n\nadvanced and holding that vide Ex.P.5 the plaintiff will not\n\nbecome allottee is perverse findings and it is in\n\ncontravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law and\n\nis in conflict with the most basic notions of justice and the\n\nsame is a ground for setting aside the Award under \nSection\n\n34 (b) (ii)\n - Explanation 1 (ii) & (iii) of the \nArbitration and\n\nConciliation Act\n of 1996.\n\n 77\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 47.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 48. The Thirtieighth ground is that the Tribunal\n\ncompletely misunderstood the law laid down under the\n\nRERA Act\n and has wrongly come to conclusion in para No.78\n\nof the award that the plaintiff is not an allottee.\n\n 48.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\n 78\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 49. The Thirtininth ground is that the Tribunal at para\n\nNo.79 of the award, erred in coming to conclusion that the\n\ntribunal has no right to adjudicate the matter which falls\n\nwithin the purview of RERA is a perverse findings and it is\n\nin contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law.\n\n 49.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat the arbitrator erred in coming to the conclusion that\n\nTribunal has no right to adjudicate the matter which falls\n\nwithin the purview of RERA.\n\n 49.b. The Arbitrator referred the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\njudgment principle \nlaid down in\n it and held that question of\n\nthe Arbitration considering \nSection 18\n of the RERA in the\n\naward of any claim being found in the developer against\n\nEx.P.1. Therefore, cannot arise. Therefore, \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\n\n 79\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence\n\nproduced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge\n\nif the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.\n\nThe Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not\n\npermissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\n\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over\n\nhis findings. \nThe nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Act is summary in nature as held in the decision\n\nreported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -\n\nS.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n).\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under\n\nSub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 50. The Fortieth ground is that the Tribunal erred in\n\napplying the principles of 2007 (4) SCC 697 & 2007 (4) SCC\n\n697 to the facts of this case, the tribunal is bound by\n\n 80\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\napplying law down under RERA provisions, the tribunal has\n\nto follow fundamental policy of Indian law.\n\n 50.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 51. The Fortifirst ground is that the Tribunal erred in\n\nnot applying the law \nlaid down in\n MANU/DE/1647/2022\n\nwherein it is categorically held that the arbitrator can apply\n\nthe provisions of RERA rules for determining damages.\n\n 51.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\n 81\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 52. The Fortisecond ground is that the Tribunal erred\n\nin not appreciating the fact that the \nRERA Act\n came into\n\nforce on 01.05.2016 and all projects which are yet to be\n\ncompleted the statute mandated that the promoters should\n\nobtain registration from RERA and provisions of RERA would\n\nbe applicable till the completion or occupancy certificate is\n\nobtained.\n\n 52.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\n 82\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 53. The Fortithird ground is that the Tribunal erred in\n\ncoming to conclusion that as on the execution of JDA the\n\nRERA act was not in force and giving a finding in para\n\nNo.80 of the award that the considering \nSection 18\n of RERA\n\nin the absence of such clause in Ex.P.1 is perverse finding\n\nand the reasoning given that \nsection 18\n of RERA act is not\n\napplicable is in contravention with the fundamental policy of\n\nIndian law and is in conflict with the most basic notions of\n\njustice and the same is a ground for setting aside the Award\n\nunder \nSection 34 (b) (ii)\n - Explanation 1 (ii) & (iii) of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n of 1996.\n\n 53.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\n 83\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nConciliation Act\n. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 54. The Fortifourth ground us that the Tribunal failed\n\nto appreciate the fact that the rights of the allottee is\n\nunfettered and as per the \nRERA Act\n the allottee is entitled to\n\ncompensation without prejudice to any other remedy, hence\n\nthe tribunal holding that plaintiff is not an allottee and is not\n\nentitled to damages is perverse finding.\n\n 54.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 84\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 55. The Fortififth ground is that the conclusion of the\n\ntribunal at para No.80 that the tribunal is not competent to\n\nadjudicate the matter coming within ambit of \nsection 18\n of\n\nRERA Act is a perverse finding when relief granted under\n\nSection 18\n is in addition to any other reliefs available to the\n\nallottee further under section 88 of RERA does not bar any\n\nother jurisdiction.\n\n 55.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 56. The Fortiseventh ground is that the tribunal even\n\nafter coming to conclusion in para No.81 & 82 of the award\n\nthat the maximum FAR the defendant No.1 was supposed to\n\n 85\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nachieve is 4.8 FAR and admittedly what is achieved as per\n\nEx.P.7 is 4.256 & tribunal still holding that there is no fault\n\nof defendant No.1 in achieving the maximum FAR is in\n\nconflict with the most basic notions of justice.\n\n 56.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal holding that there is no fault of defendant No.1\n\nin achieving the maximum FAR is contrary to law and it is\n\nhit by \nSec.34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 56.b. I have perused Clause 4 (b) of the JDA dated\n\n22.10.2012, the respondent achieved maximum of FAR\n\nlegally permissible. FAR calculated at the time of \"As Built\n\nPlan\"; i.e., Ex.R.75, Page No.265-271 was 4.627 as against\n\nthe sanctioned 4.48 FAR in the modified sanction plan.\n\nHowever, as per the Occupancy Certificate dated 5.12.2020,\n\nthe FAR is calculated as 4.256. This change in FAR is due\n\nto the Notification bearing No.UDD 255 MNJ 2018 dated\n\n19.6.2019, amending the Zoning Regulation of Bengaluru of\n\nthe Revised Master Plan-2015. Therefore, the reduction in\n\n 86\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nFAR as alleged by the Claimant is owing to the subsequent\n\namendment in the zoning regulations and not through the\n\nfault of the respondent, as alleged. In view of the\n\ndimensions of the schedule property, the respondent could\n\nnot have put up any additional construction/floors in the\n\nschedule property, as the same would then require higher\n\nsetback and higher percentage of open area, which would in\n\nturn reduce the area available for putting up construction.\n\n 56.c. I have perused award No.80 & 81 it clearly\n\nstated that the owner/developer, during his cross-\n\nexamination has stated that the buildable area for FAR 4.8\n\nis 27,475 x 4.8 = 1,31,880 sq.ft., and what is declared by\n\nthe BBMP works out to 116768.75 sq.ft., and the difference\n\nis 15,115.25. The witness has admitted to Qn.51 saying\n\nthat the FAR achievable depends upon the setback,\n\ncoverage, height. He has also admitted in answer to the\n\nsaid question that in the year 2016, there were certain\n\nchanges in the TDR and as a result there is reduced FAR.\n\n 87\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nThough the witness has stated that there was delay in\n\nobtaining plan sanction, he has not disputed the fact of the\n\nFAR getting reduced. In the light of the pleadings and\n\nevidence of P.W.1 and R.W.1 and the documents referred,\n\nthe respondent cannot be found at fault on account of the\n\nvarious circumstances referred to by him as mentioned\n\nabove, that the FAR that was achieved was only 4.256 and\n\n4.8 could not be achieved.\n\n \n56.d. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\n 88\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 57. The Fortieighth ground is that the tribunal has\n\nfailed to look into evidence of R.W.1 in his cross-examination\n\nw.r.to question No.120 he admits that he has not taken any\n\naction in obtaining maximum FAR and still holding no fault\n\ncan be found in the approach of defendant No.1 in securing\n\nthe maximum FAR is wholly perverse findings.\n\n 57.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 47th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\n 89\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nConciliation Act\n. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 58. The Fortininth ground is that the tribunal without\n\nlooking into Ex.P.6 & Ex.P.29 photographs, Ex.P.23 and\n\nEx.P.24 and also without considering the fact that as per the\n\norder sheet of A.C. No.134/2022 which is clearly indicating\n\nthe defendant No.1 handing over 10 flats in August and\n\nOctober 2022, tribunal still holding that there is no delay in\n\ncompletion of construction by the defendant No.1 is in\n\nconflict with the most basic notions of justice.\n\n 58.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal without looking to the Ex.P.6, Ex.P.24 and\n\nEx.P.29 held that there is no delay in completion of the\n\nconstruction by the defendant No.1 and it is hit by \nSec.34\n of\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n 90\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n58.b. If this ground is read and the above argument\n\nof the petitioner is considered, it is about to appreciate of the\n\ntribunal records about Ex.P.6, P.24 and P.29 and hence this\n\nground is in the nature of tenor of appeal. In order to\n\ninterfere this ground I have to make reappreciate under\n\nevidence adduced before the learned arbitrator. \nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower\n\nthe Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence\n\nproduced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge\n\nif the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.\n\nThe Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not\n\npermissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\n\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over\n\nhis findings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Act is summary in nature as held in the decision\n\nreported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -\n\nS.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n).\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under\n\nSub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\n\n 91\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act\n. Thus, the challenge by the\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 59. The Fiftieth ground is that the tribunal by not\n\nconsidering the law \nlaid down by\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nAIR 2022 SC 1824 & AIR 2021 SC 70 in regard to\n\napplication of \nsection 18\n of RERA Act for determining the\n\ndamages and not considering the claim of the plaintiff for a\n\nsum of Rs.52,40,69,454/- is in contravention with the\n\nfundamental policy of Indian law and is in conflict with the\n\nmost basic notions of justice and the same is a ground for\n\nsetting aside the Award under \nSection 34 (b) (ii)\n -\n\nExplanation 1 (ii) & (iii) of the \nArbitration and Conciliation\n\nAct\n of 1996.\n\n 59.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 35th ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n 92\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 60. The Fiftifirst ground is that the tribunal even after\n\ncoming to conclusion there is roughly delay of 4 years in\n\nobtaining plan sanction by defendant No.1 and still holding\n\nin para No.85 of the award stating the plaintiff is not\n\nentitled to Rs.15 per square feet till the completion of\n\nconstruction according to clause 4 (i) (e) of Ex.P.1 is in\n\nconflict with the most basic notions of justice.\n\n 60.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 1st ground above. For the same reasons I cannot\n\naccept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence, this\n\nground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section (2)\n\nand Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\n 93\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 61. The Fiftisecond ground is that the tribunal erred\n\nin para No.86 of the award that the plaintiff has not\n\nproduced sufficient evidence to prove for having lost 42\n\ncrores in Dubai, in spite of plaintiff producing Ex.P.17 which\n\nis an income tax returns of the plaintiff for the year 2016-17\n\nwherein it clearly discloses that plaintiff had lost 42 crores\n\nin that financial year.\n\n 61.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal erred in para-86 of the award that the plaintiff\n\nhas not produced sufficient evidence to prove for having lost\n\nRs.42 crore in Dubai in spite of plaintiff producing Ex.P.17\n\nwhich is income tax returns of the plaintiff for the year 2016-\n\n17. Hence, it is hit by \nSec.34\n of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act.\n\n 94\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n61.b. The claimant not produced positive evidence\n\nbefore the court to establish the fact that claiming sufficient\n\nloss of Rs.42 crore in Dubai. There is absolutely no evidence\n\nplaced by the petitioner before the tribunal. This ground is in\n\nthe nature and tenor of an appeal. \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the\n\nCourts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence\n\nproduced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge\n\nif the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.\n\nThe Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not\n\npermissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\n\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over\n\nhis findings. The nature of proceedings under \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Act is summary in nature as held in the decision\n\nreported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -\n\nS.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n).\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under\n\nSub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the\n\n 95\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 62. The Fiftithird ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that the evidence of plaintiff in para\n\nNo.59 is not challenged in cross-examination and tribunal\n\nstill holding the plaintiff failed to prove loss in Dubai to an\n\nextent of 42 crores is perverse finding.\n\n 62.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 52nd ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 63. The Fiftifourth ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that as per clause 16 of Ex.P.1 wherein\n\n 96\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthe defendant No.1 had agreed to obtain sanction plan\n\nwithin 6 months and execute sharing agreement within 15\n\ndays and would also do marketing for the sale of flats\n\nwhich are allotted to the plaintiff and would get sufficient\n\nfunds to solve financial crisis in Dubai is not considered by\n\nthe tribunal and holding that the plaintiff has failed to prove\n\nthe loss of Rs.42 crores and stating no evidence is in correct.\n\n 63.a. I have discussed about this aspect while\n\nanswering 52nd ground above. For the same reasons I\n\ncannot accept the said contention of the petitioner. Hence,\n\nthis ground is not arises for the petitioner under Sub-Section\n\n(2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling\n\nfor the setting aside of arbitral award on this ground is\n\nrejected.\n\n 64. The Fiftififth ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that GST was introduced on 01.07.2017\n\nthe defendant No.1 was supposed to complete the\n\n 97\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nconstruction in all aspects as per the terms mentioned Ex.P.1\n\nwas 22.04.2016, because of negligence of the defendant\n\nNo.1 GST of 18% got applicable instead of 4% VAT and\n\nfindings of the tribunal at para No.91 holding that the\n\nplaintiff is still liable to pay GST is in conflict with the most\n\nbasic notions of justice.\n\n 64.a. The learned advocate for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal failed to appreciate the GST was introduced on\n\n1.7.2017. The defendant No.1 was supposed to complete\n\nthe construction in all aspects as per the terms of Ex.P.1\n\nwas 22.4.2016 and tribunal VAT charges and GST charges\n\nimposed contrary to the law and hence it is hit by \nSection 34\n\nof Arbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n \n64.b. To give finding on this ground it is appreciate\n\nthe document Ex.P.1 and evidence on both sides. But, as\n\nper \nSec.34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does\n\nnot empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the\n\nevidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal and\n\n 98\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are\n\ncorrect or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly held\n\nthat it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 65. The Fiftisixth ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that Rs.15,00,00,000/- is interest free\n\nsecurity deposit amount and the tribunal awarding interest\n\non the said amount and directing the plaintiff to return with\n\n 99\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ninterest @ 12% P.A. is conflict with terms of Ex.P.1 and P.3\n\nand also in conflict with the most basic notions of justice.\n\n \n65.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings.

Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 100\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 66. The Fiftiseventh ground is that the trial court\n\nfailed to appreciate the fact that the defendant No.1 as per\n\nthe terms of clause 2 (iii) Ex.P.1, the defendant No.1 should\n\nhave given the certificate of completion to plaintiff to seek\n\nrefund of the amounts, admittedly the defendant is not given\n\nthe certificate and further it is admitted in cross of R.W.1\n\nthat he has not handed over the certificate to plaintiff hence\n\nthe findings of the tribunal to refund the amount is in conflict\n\nwith the most basic notions of justice.\n\n \n66.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\n 101\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 67. The Fiftieighth ground is that the tribunal\n\ndirecting the plaintiff to pay interest amount, electricity\n\ncharges & maintenance charges before handing over\n\npossession of flats is in conflict with the most basic notions\n\nof justice.\n\n \n67.a. To answer this ground again it is necessary to\n\nappreciate Ex.R.52 and Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.5 and oral and\n\ndocumentary evidence. But, this ground is in the nature and\n\n 102\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ntenor of an appeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 does not empower the Courts to re-\n\nappreciate and re-evaluate the evidence produced before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge if the findings of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong. The Superior Courts\n\nhave repeatedly held that it is not permissible to a Court to\n\nexamine the correctness of the findings of the arbitrator, as\n\nif it were sitting in appeal over his findings. The nature of\n\nproceedings under \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in\n\nnature as held in the decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C.\n\nOnline - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi\n\nLimited vs. M. Shashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not\n\navailable for the Petitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-\n\nsection (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\n\nAct. Thus, the challenge by the Petitioner calling for the\n\nsetting aside of arbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 68. The Fiftininth ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the fact that nowhere in the Ex.P.1 the plaintiff\n\n 103\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nhas agreed to pay club house charges and tribunal direc ting\n\nplaintiff to pay sum of Rs.85 lakhs is perverse finding,\n\nfurther club house charges are paid by the purchasers of the\n\nflat, hence order of the tribunal to pay sum of Rs.85 lakhs is\n\nin conflict with the most basic notions of justice.\n\n \n68.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\n 104\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 69. The Sixtieth ground is that the tribunal erred in\n\nnot appreciating the fact that by virtue of \nSection 16 (2)\n of\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 the respondent\n\ncould not have taken a contention regarding the jurisdiction\n\nof the tribunal.\n\n 69.a. The learned counsel for the petitioner argued\n\nthat tribunal erred not appreciating the fact that by virtue of\n\nSec.16 (2)\n of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1966, the\n\nrespondent could not have taken contention regarding the\n\njurisdiction of the Tribunal, hence it is hit by \nSec.34\n of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act.\n\n \n69.b. A plea that the Arbitral Tribunal does not have\n\njurisdiction shall be raised not later than submission of the\n\n 105\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ndefence. However, a party shall not be precluded from\n\nraising such a plea, merely because that he has appointed\n\nor participated in the appointment of the Arbitrator. This\n\nground is in the nature and tenor of an appeal. \nSection 34\n\nof the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 does not empower\n\nthe Courts to re- appreciate and re-evaluate the evidence\n\nproduced before the Arbitral Tribunal and thereafter to judge\n\nif the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal are correct or wrong.\n\nThe Superior Courts have repeatedly held that it is not\n\npermissible to a Court to examine the correctness of the\n\nfindings of the arbitrator, as if it were sitting in appeal over\n\nhis findings.

Online - S.C. - 1244 = (2019) 9 -\n\nS.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M. Shashikala\n).\n\nHence, this ground is not available for the Petitioner under\n\nSub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the challenge by the\n\n 106\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nPetitioner calling for the setting aside of arbitral award on\n\nthis ground is rejected.\n\n 70. The Sixtifirst ground is that the tribunal failed to\n\nappreciate the law \nlaid down in\n AIR 2016 SC 3488.\n\n \n70.a. This ground is in the nature and tenor of an\n\nappeal. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong.

Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\n 107\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 71. The Sixtisecond ground is that the tribunal failed\n\nto consider the citations and written arguments filed by the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n 71.a. This is also general ground and same will be\n\ndiscussed along with other grounds urged by the petitioner.\n\n 72. The Sixtithird ground is that the award passed by\n\nthe tribunal without looking into the documents furnished\n\nand written arguments filed is perverse order and it is liable\n\nto be set aside.\n\n 72.a. This is also general ground and same will be\n\ndiscussed along with other grounds urged by the petitioner.\n\n 73. The Sixtifourth ground is that the award passed\n\nby the defendant No.2/tribunal is not a speaking award.\n\n 108\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 73.a. This is also general ground and same will be\n\ndiscussed along with other grounds urged by the petitioner.\n\n \n74. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 does not empower the Courts to re- appreciate and re-\n\nevaluate the evidence produced before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand thereafter to judge if the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nare correct or wrong. The Superior Courts have repeatedly\n\nheld that it is not permissible to a Court to examine the\n\ncorrectness of the findings of the arbitrator, as if it were\n\nsitting in appeal over his findings. In fact, this ground is in\n\nthe nature and tenor of appeal. The nature of proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act is summary in nature as held in\n\nthe decision reported in (2019) - S.C.C. Online - S.C. - 1244\n\n= (2019) 9 - S.C.C. - 462 ( \nCanara Nidhi Limited vs. M.\n\nShashikala\n). Hence, this ground is not available for the\n\nPetitioner under Sub-section (2) and Sub-section (2-A) of\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. Thus, the\n\n 109\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nchallenge by the Petitioner calling for the setting aside of\n\narbitral award on this ground is rejected.\n\n 75. The scope of this court is limited with regard to\n\nSection 34\n of the Act. The position of law stands crystallized\n\ntoday, that findings, of fact as well as of law, of the\n\narbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal are ordinarily not amenable to\n\ninterference under \nSection 34\n of the Act. The scope of\n\ninterference is only where the finding of the Tribunal is\n\neither contrary to the terms of the contract between the\n\nparties, or, ex facie, perverse, that interference, by this court,\n\nis absolutely necessary. The arbitrator is the final arbiter on\n\nfacts as well as in law, and even errors, factual or legal,\n\nwhich stop short of perversity, do not merit interference\n\nunder \nSection 34\n of the Act. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi\n\nin the decision reported in 2015 - S.C.C. OnLine - Del -\n\n13192 (P.C.L. Suncon (JV) vs. NHAI), in Paragraph No. 24\n\nhas held as follows :-\n\n 110\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n\"24. As a postscript, this Court believes that it is imperative\n\nto sound a word of caution. Notwithstanding the\n\nconsiderable jurisprudence advising the Courts to remain\n\ncircumspect in denying the enforcement of arbitral awards,\n\ninterference with the awards challenged in the petitions\n\nbefore them has become a matter of routine, imperceptibly\n\nbut surely erasing the distinction between arbitral tribunals\n\nand courts. \nSection 34\n jurisdiction calls for judicial restraint\n\nand an awareness that the process is removed from\n\nappellate review. Arbitration as a form of alternate dispute\n\nresolution, running parallel to the judicial system, attempts\n\nto avoid the prolix and lengthy process of the courts and\n\npresupposes parties consciously agreeing to submit a\n\npotential dispute to arbitration with the object of actively\n\navoiding a confrontation in the precincts of the judicial\n\nsystem. If a court is allowed to review the decision of the\n\narbitral tribunal on the law or on the merits, the speed and,\n\nabove all, the efficacy of the arbitral process is lost.\"\n\n 111\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n76. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision\n\nreported in (2006) 11 - S.C.C. - 181 ( \nMcDermott\n\nInternational Inc. vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd. and Ors\n .), has\n\nheld as follows :-\n\n\"52. The 1996 Act makes provision for the supervisory role\n\nof courts, for the review of the arbitral award only to ensure\n\nfairness. Intervention of the court is envisaged in few\n\ncircumstances only, like, in case of fraud or bias by the\n\narbitrators, violation of natural justice, etc. The court cannot\n\ncorrect errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the award\n\nleaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again if it is\n\ndesired. So, scheme of the provision aims at keeping the\n\nsupervisory role of the court at minimum level and this can\n\nbe justified as parties to the agreement make a conscious\n\ndecision to exclude the court's jurisdiction by opting for\n\narbitration as they prefer the expediency and finality offered\n\nby it.\"\n\n 112\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 77. Thus, it is observed and held that the arbitral\n\naward is not marred by any patent illegality, as there is no\n\ncontravention of the substantive law of India, which would\n\nresult in the death knell of an arbitral award. It is also\n\nobserved that there is no patent illegality in the arbitral\n\naward, which must go to the root of the matter. The arbitral\n\naward is also a well reasoned and a speaking award. The\n\narbitral award is also held to not be in contravention of\n\nSection 28(3)\n of the Act, which pertains to the terms of the\n\ncontract, trade usages applicable to the nature of contract\n\nand substance of dispute.\n\n 78. \nThe Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act,\n\n2015\n made major changes to \nSection 34\n. The changes were\n\nsuggested by the 246th Report of the Law Commission of\n\nIndia on Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\n1996 of August 2014 and the Supplementary to the 246th\n\nReport of the Law Commission of India on Amendments to\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 of February 2015.\n\n 113\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nThese changes were aimed at restricting Courts from\n\ninterfering with arbitral awards on the ground of \"public\n\npolicy.\" Accordingly, the amendment added \"Explanation 2\"\n\nto \nSection 34(2)\n as well as Section 2A.\n\nExplanation 2 of \nSection 34(2)\n states -\n\n\"For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a\n\ncontravention with the fundamental policy of Indian Law\n\nshall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.\"\n\n 79. Because of this amendment, Courts would no\n\nlonger be able to interfere with the award passed by the\n\narbitrator. The explanation makes it especially clear that in\n\nno way would a Court be entailed to review the award on\n\nmerits of the dispute. However, after amendment to\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n, Section 2A also curtails the\n\nscope of interpretation of \"patently illegal\" as propounded in\n\nthe said decision\n reported in 2003 (5) - S.C.C. - 705 (ONGC\n\nvs. Saw Pipes Limited). Section 2A states :-\n\n 114\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n\"An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than\n\ninternational commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside\n\nby the Court, if the Court finds that the award is vitiate by\n\npatent illegality appearing on the face of the award:\n\nProvided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the\n\nground of an erroneous application of law or by\n\nreappreciation of evidence.\"\n\n 80. Thus, Courts can no longer reappraise evidence or\n\nset aside awards merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has\n\nmade errors when dealing with the same.\n\n 81. Hence, the scope of interference is only where the\n\nfinding of the Tribunal is either contrary to the terms of the\n\ncontract between the parties, or, ex facie, perverse, that\n\ninterference, by this court, is absolutely necessary. The\n\nArbitrator is the final arbiter on facts as well as in law, and\n\neven errors, factual or legal, which stops short of perversity,\n\ndoes not merit interference under \nSection 34\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. Courts can no longer\n\n 115\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nreappraise evidence or set aside awards merely because the\n\nArbitral Tribunal has made errors when dealing with the\n\nsame.\n\n 82. \nIn the decision reported in ( 2017) 13 - SCALE -\n\n91 (SC) (\nVenture Global Engineering LLC and Ors vs. Tech\n\nMahindra Ltd. and Ors\n), the Hon'ble Supreme court has held\n\nas follows:-\n\n\"The Award of an Arbitral Tribunal can be set aside only on\n\nthe grounds specified in \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act and on no other ground. The Court cannot\n\nact as an Appellate Court to examine the legality of Award,\n\nnor it can examine the merits of claim by entering in factual\n\narena like an Appellate Court.\"\n\n \n83. A similar view is also taken in the decision\n\nreported in (2017) 14 - SCALE - 240 (SC) ( \nSutlej\n\nConstruction vs. The Union Territory of Chandigarh\n).\n\n 116\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n84. The learned Advocate for the respondent has\n\nrelied on a decision reported in 2019 (15) - S.C.C. - 131\n\n(\nSsangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National\n\nHighways Authority of India Ltd.\n), wherein the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has once again reiterated the law related to\n\nthe examination by a Court of an Award under \nSection 34\n of\n\nthe Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and has held as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"34. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression public\n\npolicy of India, whether contained in \nSection 34\n or in \nSection\n\n48\n, would now mean the fundamental policy of Indian law\n\nas explained in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders\n\n(supra), i.e., the fundamental policy of Indian law would be\n\nrelegated to the \"Renusagar\" understanding of this\n\nexpression. This would necessarily mean that the Western\n\nGeco (supra) expansion has been done away with. In short,\n\nWestern Geco (supra), as explained in paragraphs 28 and\n\n29 of Associate Builders (supra), would no longer obtain, as\n\n 117\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nunder the guise of interfering with an award on the ground\n\nthat the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the\n\nCourt's intervention would be on the merits of the award,\n\nwhich cannot be permitted post amendment. However, in so\n\nfar as principles of natural justice are concerned, as\n\ncontained in \nSections 18\n and \n34(2) (a) (iii)\n of the 1996 Act,\n\nthese continue to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is\n\ncontained in paragraph 30 of Associate Builders (supra).\n\n 85. It is important to notice that the ground for\n\ninterference in so far as it concerns \"interest of India\" has\n\nsince been deleted, and therefore, no longer obtains.\n\nEqually, the ground for interference on the basis that the\n\naward is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be\n\nunderstood as a conflict with the \"most basic notions of\n\nmorality or justice\". This again would be in line with\n\nparagraphs 36 to 39 of Associate Builders (supra), as it is\n\nonly such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the\n\ncourt that can be set aside on this ground.\n\n 118\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 86. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now\n\nconstricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is\n\ncontrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as\n\nunderstood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders\n\n(supra), or secondly, that such award is against basic\n\nnotions of justice or morality as understood in paragraphs\n\n36 to 39 of Associate Builders (supra). Explanation 2 to\n\nSection 34(2)(b)(ii)\n and Explanation 2 to \nSection 48(2)(b)(ii)\n\nwas added by the Amendment Act only so that Western\n\nGeco (supra), as understood in Associate Builders (supra),\n\nand paragraphs 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away\n\nwith.\n\n 87. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are\n\nconcerned, an additional ground is now available under\n\nsubsection (2A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to\n\nSection 34\n.Here, there must be patent illegality appearing on\n\nthe face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes\n\nto the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere\n\n 119\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nerroneous application of the law. In short, what is not\n\nsubsumed within the fundamental policy of Indian law,\n\nnamely, the contravention of a statute not linked to public\n\npolicy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the back\n\ndoor when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground\n\nof patent illegality.\n\n 88. Secondly, it is also made clear that reappreciation\n\nof evidence, which is what an appellate court is permitted to\n\ndo, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality\n\nappearing on the face of the award.\n\n 89. To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of Associate\n\nBuilders (supra), namely, a mere contravention of the\n\nsubstantive law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground\n\navailable to set aside an arbitral award. Paragraph 42.2 of\n\nAssociate Builders (supra), however, would remain, for if an\n\narbitrator gives no reasons for an award and contravenes\n\nSection 31(3)\n of the 1996 Act, that would certainly amount to\n\na patent illegality on the face of the award.\n\n 120\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n 90. The change made in \nSection 28(3)\n by the\n\nAmendment Act really follows what is stated in paragraphs\n\n42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders (supra), namely, that the\n\nconstruction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an\n\narbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the\n\ncontract in a manner that no fair minded or reasonable\n\nperson would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not even\n\na possible view to take. Also, if the arbitrator wanders\n\noutside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to\n\nhim, he commits an error of jurisdiction. This ground of\n\nchallenge will now fall within the new ground added under\n\nSection 34(2A)\n.\n\n 91. What is important to note is that a decision which\n\nis perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31 and 32 of\n\nAssociate Builders (supra), while no longer being aground\n\nfor challenge under public policy of India, would certainly\n\namount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the\n\naward. Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an\n\n 121\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\naward which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision\n\nwould be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground\n\nof patent illegality. Additionally, a finding based on\n\ndocuments taken behind the back of the parties by the\n\narbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no\n\nevidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on\n\nevidence led by the parties, and therefore, would also have\n\nto be characterized as perverse.\"\n\n 92. \nIn the decision reported in 2019 (16) - SCALE -\n\n823 (\nHindustan Construction Company Limited & Anr. vs.\n\nUnion of India & Ors.\n) , the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"49. Further, this Court has repeatedly held that an\n\napplication under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996 is a\n\nsummary proceeding not in the nature of a regular suit - \nsee\n\nCanara Nidhi Ltd. v. M. Shashikala\n 2019 SCC Online SC\n\n1244 at paragraph 20.\n \nAs a result, a court reviewing an\n\narbitral award under \nSection 34\n does not sit in appeal over\n\n 122\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthe award, and if the view taken by the arbitrator is\n\npossible, no interference is called for - \nsee Associated\n\nConstruction v. Pawanhans Helicopters Limited\n. (2008)16\n\nSCC 128 at paragraph 17.\n\n \n93. Also, as has been held in the recent decision\n\nSsangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. NHAI\n\n2019 SCC Online SC 677, after the 2015 Amendment Act,\n\nthis Court cannot interfere with an arbitral award on\n\nmerits.\"\n\n \n94. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the decision\n\nreported in 2020 - SCC Online - S.C. - 466 ( \nPatel\n\nEngineering Ltd. vs. North Eastern Power Corporation Ltd\n)\n\nhas once again exposited the 'patent illegality' ground,\n\nappearing in \nSection 34 (2A)\n of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996.\n \nThe most significant part of this\n\njudgment is the recognition and reaffirmation given to the\n\ntest of patent illegality, as set out in Paragraph (42.3) of the\n\nabove-mentioned decision reported in 2015 (3) - S.C.C. - 49\n\n 123\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n(\nAssociate Builders vs. DDA\n) and which was reiterated in\n\nParagraph (40) of the decision reported in 2019 (15) - S.C.C.\n\n- 131 (\nSsangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs.\n\nNational Highways Authority of India Ltd.\n). The\n\naforementioned test of 'patent illegality' lays down that any\n\ncontravention of \nSection 28 (3)\n of the Arbitration &\n\nConciliation Act, 1996 is deemed to be a sub-head of patent\n\nillegality. According to it, an Arbitral Tribunal must decide in\n\naccordance with the terms of the contract, but if an\n\nArbitrator construes a term of the contract in such a way\n\nthat it could be said to be something that no fair minded or\n\nreasonable person could do, the same will render the award\n\n'patently illegal'.\n\n 95. By keeping in mind about the said legal aspects, I\n\nam of the opinion that the Arbitral Award is not marred by\n\nany patent illegality, as there is no contravention of the\n\nsubstantive law of India, which would result in the death\n\nknell of an Arbitral Award. It is also observed that there is\n\n 124\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nno patent illegality in the Arbitral Award, which must go to\n\nthe root of the matter. The Arbitral Award is also a well\n\nreasoned and a speaking award. The Arbitral Award is also\n\nheld to not be in contravention of \nSection 28(3)\n of the\n\nArbitration & Conciliation Act, which pertains to the terms of\n\nthe contract, trade usages applicable to the nature of\n\ncontract and substance of dispute.\n\n 96. On a parting note, I would like to add, that the\n\nchallenge to the various clauses of contract by the Petitioner\n\nunder the present petition is not tenable. It is accordingly,\n\nheld that the Arbitral Award is neither against the\n\nfundamental policy of India nor in contravention of law.\n\nTherefore, I find no perversity in the Arbitral Award and the\n\nsame is upheld.\n\n 97. Having given my careful consideration to the\n\nsubmissions urged and the complete case record in the\n\npreceding paragraphs of this judgment, I am of the view that\n\nis not a fit and proper case for exercise the jurisdiction of\n\n 125\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nthis court under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation\n\nAct and interfere with the Arbitral Award and the same is\n\nupheld.\n\n 98. In my humble opinion, it cannot be said, in the\n\npresent matter, that finding recorded by the Learned\n\nArbitrator is based on no evidence or it has ignored vital\n\nevidence before arriving at the decision. A bare perusal of\n\nthe award passed by the Learned Arbitrator shows that\n\nevidence of both the parties have been considered in detail\n\nand the Learned Arbitrator has taken into account each and\n\nevery submissions advanced by the parties before him,\n\nincluding appreciation of evidence in proper manner before\n\narriving at the decision to pass the impugned award and as\n\nsuch, the judgment cited by the Learned Counsel for the\n\nPetitioner, is of little assistance to him.\n\n \n99. For the said aspect, I wish to refer a recent\n\ndecision of the Hon'ble Apex Court reported in (2021) 3 -\n\nS.C.C. - 308 (Anglo American Metallurgical Coal Pty. \nLtd. vs.\n\n 126\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nMMTC Limited\n), wherein it has laid down the parameters of\n\njudicial review and Courts have been permitted to interfere\n\nonly if there is a ground of patent illegality or violation of\n\nfundamental policy of Indian law and if a possible view is\n\nbased on oral and documentary evidence led in the case,\n\nwhich cannot be characterized as being either perverse or\n\nbeing based on no evidence and as such, no interference is\n\npermissible. The relevant portion of the judgment is\n\nreproduced hereunder:-\n\n\"48. Given the parameters of judicial review \nlaid down in\n\nAssociate Builders, it is obvious that neither the ground of\n\nfundamental policy of Indian law, nor the ground of patent\n\nillegality, have been made out in the facts of this case, given\n\nthe fact that the majority award is certainly a possible view\n\nbased on the oral and documentary evidence led in the case,\n\nwhich cannot be characterized as being either perverse or\n\nbeing based on no evidence.\"\n\n 127\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\n \n100. The learned Advocate for the Petitioner has\n\nrelied on a recent Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nDelhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited vs. Delhi Metro\n\nRai\n l Corporation Limited in Civi l Appea l No . 5627 / 2021 (\n\narising out of SLP (C) No . 4115 / 2019 ) decided on\n\n09.09.2021. In \nthe said judgment\n, the Arbitral Award which\n\nwas challenged before the Hon'ble High Court under \nSection\n\n34\n was dismissed and in appeal under \nSection 37\n. The\n\nDivision Bench of Hon'ble High Court has allowed the appeal\n\nand set aside the award. In this judgment, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has set aside the order of the Division Bench.\n\nIn the said Judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Para 24\n\nhas held as under:-\n\n\"24. This court has in several other judgments interpreted\n\nSection 34\n of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be\n\nshown by courts while examining the validity of the arbitral\n\nawards. The limited grounds available to courts for\n\nannulment of arbitral awards are well known to legally\n\n 128\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ntrained minds. However, the difficulty arises in applying the\n\nwell-established principles for interference to the facts of\n\neach case that come up before the courts. There is a\n\ndisturbing tendency of courts setting aside arbitral awards,\n\nafter dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases\n\nto come to a conclusion that the award needs intervention\n\nand thereafter, dubbing the award to be vitiated by either\n\nperversity or patent illegality, apart from the other grounds\n\navailable for annulment of the award. This approach would\n\nlead to corrosion of the objection of the 1996 Act and the\n\nendeavours made to preserve this court, which is minimal\n\njudicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart,\n\nseveral judicial pronouncements of this court would become\n\na dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorizing\n\nthem as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the\n\ncontours of the said expressions.\"\n\n 101. The Hon'ble Supreme Court at Para 35 of the\n\nsaid Judgment has held that as the arbitrator is the sole\n\n 129\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\njudge of the quality as well as the quantity of the evidence,\n\nthe task of being a judge on the evidence before the Tribunal\n\ndoes not fall upon the court in exercise of its jurisdiction\n\nunder \nSection 34\n. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has also held\n\nin Para 39 of the said Judgment that construction of the\n\ncontract is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and merely\n\nbecause another view is possible, the court cannot interfere\n\nwith such construction and substitute its own view.\n\n 102. On going through these Judgments, it makes\n\nfurther clear that Arbitrator is sole judge of the quality and\n\nquantity of the evidence and construction of contract is\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the court cannot\n\nlightly interfere with the award passed by the learned\n\nArbitrator. On considering the facts of the present case, as\n\nheld in this Judgment there are no grounds to set aside the\n\naward of the learned Arbitrator under \nSection 34\n of the Act.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in this Judgment has even held\n\nthat patent illegality which do not go to the root of the matter\n\n 130\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\nand every error of law committed by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\ncould not fall within the expression patent illegality.\n\n \n103. Relying upon the law laid in the decision\n\nreported in 2015 (5) - S.C.C. - 698 (\nNavodaya Mass\n\nEntertainment Limited vs. J.M. Combines\n), it can be said\n\nthat not only the reasoning of Arbitral Tribunal are logical,\n\nbut all the material and evidence were taken note of by\n\nArbitral Tribunal and this Court cannot substitute own\n\nevaluation of conclusion of law or fact to come to the\n\nconclusion other than that of Arbitral Tribunal. Cogent\n\ngrounds, sufficient reasons have been assigned by Arbitral\n\nTribunal in reaching the just conclusion and no error of law\n\nor misconduct is apparent on the face of the record. This\n\nCourt cannot re-appraise the evidence and it is not open to\n\nthis Court to sit in the appeal over the conclusion/findings of\n\nfacts arrived at by Arbitral Tribunal. Re-appraisal of the\n\nmatter cannot be done by this Court. No error is apparent in\n\nrespect of the Impugned Award. I do not find any\n\n 131\n\n A.S. No.25003/2023\n\ncontradiction in the observations and findings given by\n\nArbitral Tribunal. The Impugned Award does not suffer from\n\nvice of irrationality and perversity. The conclusion of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal is based on a possible view of the matter,\n\nso the Court is not expected to interfere with the award.\n\nEven impugned award passed by Arbitral Tribunal cannot\n\nbe set aside on the ground that it was erroneous. The award\n\nis not against any public policy nor against the terms of\n\ncontract of the parties. No ground for interference is made\n\nout. None of the grounds raised by the petitioner attract\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. Therefore,\n\nI answer this Point in Negative.\n\n 104. Point No. 2: Therefore, I proceed to pass the\n\nfollowing:-\n\n ORDER\n\n The Petition filed under\n \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and\n\n 132\n\n A.S.
