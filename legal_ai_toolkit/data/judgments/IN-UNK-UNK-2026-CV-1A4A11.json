After qualifying\n\nthe departmental examination conducted by the\n\nrespondent to the post of Lower Division Clerk (LDC), the\n\napplicant was appointed as such w.e.f. 09.07.2008.\n\n1.2 Similarly situated LDCs, who were initially engaged as\n\ndaily rated casual workers during 1988 to 1990, seeking\n\nregularization of their services with effect from the date of\n\ntheir initial engagement as casual workers with all\n\nconsequential benefits, had approached before this\n\nTribunal by filing OA Nos. 1557/1998 and 436/2005\n\n(\nRavindranath V.K. & Ors. vs. UOI & Ors.\n and \nA.R.\n\nParameswaran & Ors. vs. UOI & Ors.\n], which were\n\nallowed vide Orders dated 14.07.2003 and 13.06.2005,\n\nrespectively with a direction to the respondents to grant the\n\nbenefits of regularization with effect from their date of\n\ninitial engagement as casual workers with all consequential\n\n 3\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nbenefits other than seniority namely eligibility to appear in\n\nthe promotion tests or examinations and for terminal\n\nbenefits etc.\n\n1.3 In compliance of the aforesaid decisions of the\n\nTribunal, the respondents vide order dated 06.12.2006\n\ngranted the benefits of notional fixation of pay, eligibility to\n\nappear in the test/examination for higher grade, counting\n\nof qualifying service for terminal benefits from the date of\n\ntheir initial engagement.\n\n1.4 On coming to know that the respondents have\n\nregularized the services of similarly situated persons from\n\nthe date of their initial engagement, applicant made a\n\nrepresentation dated 22.10.2009 to the respondents\n\nseeking similar reliefs in terms of the aforesaid decision of\n\nthe Tribunal.\n\n1.5 Various Superintendents/Assistants working under\n\nthe respondents also approached the Ernakulam Bench of\n\nthis Tribunal by filing OA Nos.75/2010, 82/2010 and\n\n196/2010 seeking regularization from the date of their\n\ninitial engagement, which were also allowed by a common\n\norder dated 12.08.2011 in terms of its earlier order passed\n\nin OA No.1557/2008 (supra). In compliance, the\n\n 4\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nrespondents had also granted the benefits to the applicants\n\ntherein vide order dated 11.05.2012.\n\n1.6 The applicant herein also espoused his grievance\n\nthrough the Association seeking benefit of the aforesaid\n\norders of the Tribunal by filing representation dated\n\n06.12.2012. As a model employer, the respondents ought to\n\nhave extended similar benefits to the similarly situated\n\npersons like the applicant to avoid frustration among the\n\nemployees, but they adopted „pick and choose‟ policy in\n\ngranting such benefits on their own thereby discriminating\n\nthe applicant.\n\n1.7 Feeling aggrieved, the applicant approached the\n\nTribunal by way of OA No.1920/2013 seeking extension of\n\nbenefits as granted by the Ernakulam Bench, but the said\n\nOA was allowed to be withdrawn vide order dated\n\n22.09.2015, with liberty to file fresh one with better\n\nparticulars. Hence, the instant OA has been filed seeking\n\nthe following reliefs:-\n\n \"(i) Call for the relevant records of the\n respondents in the matter;\n\n (ii) Declare that the applicant is entitled for\n extension of benefits of the\n\n \norders/judgments dated 14.07.2003 and\n 13.06.2005 [Annexure A-3(Colly)] of\n Ernakulam Bench of this Hon‟ble Tribunal\n in OA Nos.1557/1998 and 436/2005 titled\n \"\nRavindranath V.K. & Ors. vs. Union of\n India & Ors.\n\" and \"\nA.R. Parameswaran &\n\n 5\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n Ors. vs. UOI & Ors.\n\" respectively and also\n common order/judgment dated 12.08.2011\n (Annexure A-8) in OA Nos.75/2010,\n 82/2010 & 196/2010;\n\n (iii) Declare that the applicant is entitled for\n being regularized as L.D.C. w.e.f.\n\n 14.06.1989, i.e. the date of his initial\n engagement as daily rated casual worker,\n re-fixation of his pay as LDC from the date\n of his initial engagement, i.e. 14.6.1989,\n payment of arrears of pay from the date of\n his regularization and counting of his\n casual service for the purpose of\n terminal/retiral benefits.\n\n (iv) Direct the respondents to regularize the\n applicant as L.D.C. w.e.f. 14.6.1989, i.e.,\n the date of his initial engagement as daily\n rated casual worker and to re-fix the pay of\n the applicant as LDC from the date of his\n initial engagement, i.e. 14.6.1989, with all\n consequential benefits, viz., consequential\n promotion/ACP/MACP benefits, payment of\n arrears of pay from the date of his\n regularization and counting of his casual\n service for the purpose of terminal/retiral\n benefits.\n\n (v) Further direct the respondents to pay\n interest at the rate decided by this Hon‟ble\n Tribunal on arrears of pay.\n\n (vi) Order exemplary cost against the\n respondents and in favour of the\n applicant.\"\n\n2. Per contra, the respondents filed a counter affidavit.\n\nBesides admitting the factual matrix of the case, they\n\nstated that the applicant was afforded an opportunity to\n\nappear in the Special Qualifying Examination conducted in\n\n1993 for direct appointment to the post of LDC, but he\n\ncould not qualify the same. They also submitted that the\n\napplicant was promoted to the post of LDC from the post of\n\nDaftry, therefore, he is not entitled to regularization form\n\n 6\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nthe initial date of his engagement without passing the\n\nprescribed test for LDC. Moreover, it is pertinent to\n\nmention here that Casual Labourers and Daily Rated\n\nClerks are two different categories of workers, hence, not\n\ncomparable.\n\n2.1 In view of the above position, learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents argued that the case of the applicant is not\n\ncovered by decisions of the Tribunal relied upon by him,\n\nhence, the instant OA lacks merit and deserved to be\n\ndismissed.\n\n3. The applicant has filed rejoinder to the reply filed on\n\nbehalf of the respondents denying their averments and\n\nreiterating the facts of the OA.\n\n4. The respondents have also filed an additional affidavit\n\nto the rejoinder filed by the applicant more or less\n\nreiterating their stand taken in the reply, as mentioned\n\nabove.\n\n5. We have heard Mr. R.V. Sinha assisted by Mr. Amit\n\nSinha, learned counsel for the applicant; Mr. Gynendra\n\nSingh, learned counsel for the respondents and perused\n\nthe pleadings available on record as well as the decisions\n\nrelied upon by the learned counsels for both the parties.\n\n 7\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nThe learned counsel for applicant has also filed the written\n\nsubmissions.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n6. The crux of the matter is that what would be the\n\nrelevant date of regularization that is to say whether initial\n\ndate of engagement or shall it be prospective i.e. date of\n\npromotion to the post of LDC? In other words, whether\n\ncasual employees subsequently regularized are entitled for\n\nregularization from the date of their initial engagement?\n\n6.1 In \nState Of Haryana & Ors. vs Piara Singh & Ors\n.\n\n[1992 AIR 2130, 1992 SCR (3) 826], the Hon‟ble Supreme\n\nCourt observed as under:-\n\n 10. Ordinarily speaking, the creation and abolition of a\n post is the prerogative of the Executive. It is the Executive\n again that lays down the conditions of service subject, of\n course, to a law made the appropriate legislature. This\n power to prescribe the conditions service can be exercised\n either by making Rules under the proviso to \nArticle 309\n of\n the Constitution or (in the absence of such Rules) by\n issuing Rules/instructions in exercise of its executive\n power. The court comes into the picture only to ensure\n observance of fundamental rights, statutory provisions,\n Rules and other instructions, if any, governing the\n conditions of service. The main concern of the court in\n such matters is to ensure the Rule of law and to see that\n the executive acts fairly and gives a fair deal to its\n employees consistent with the requirements of \nArticles 14\n\n and \n16.\n It also means that the State should not exploit its\n employees nor should it seek to take advantage of the\n helplessness and misery of either the unemployed\n persons or the employees, as the case may be. As is often\n said, the State must be a model employer. It is for this\n reason, it is held that equal pay must be given for equal\n work, which is indeed one of the directive principles of\n the Constitution. It is for this very reason it is held that a\n person should not be kept in a temporary or ad hoc\n status for long. Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment\n\n 8\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nis continued for long the court presumes that there is\nneed and warrant for a regular post and accordingly\ndirects regularization. \nWhile all the situations in which\nthe court may act to ensure fairness cannot be detailed\nhere, it is sufficient to indicate that the guiding principles\nare the ones stated above. The principle relevant in this\nbehalf are stated by this Court in several decisions, of\nwhich it would be sufficient to mention two decisions\nhaving a bearing upon the issue involved here. They are\nDharwad Distt. \nP.W.D. Literature Daily Wage Employees\nAssociation v. State of Karnataka and Ors.\n [1990] 2\n\nS.C.C. 396 and Jacob v Kerala Water Authority\n alleged\nthat about 50,000 persons were being employed on daily-\n\nrated or on monthly-rated basis over a period of 15 to 20\nyears, without regularizing them. It was contended that\nthe very fact that they are continued over such a long\nperiod is itself proof of the fact that there is regular need\nfor such employment. \"\n\nXxxxxx\n\n\"25. Before parting with this case, we think it appropriate\nto say a few words concerning the issue of regularization\nof adhoc/temporary employees in government service.\nThe normal rule, of course, is regular recruitment through\nthe prescribed agency but exigencies of administration\nmay sometimes call for an adhoc or temporary\nappointment to be made. In such a situation, effort\nshould always be to replace such an adhoc/temporary\nemployee by a regularly selected employee as early as\npossible. Such a temporary employee may also compete\nalong with others for such regular selection/appointment.\nIf he gets selected, well and good, but if he does not, he\nmust give way to the regularly selected candidate. The\nappointment of the regularly selected candidate cannot\nbe withheld or kept in abeyance for the sake of such an\nadhoc/temporary employee.\n\nSecondly, an adhoc or temporary employee should not be\nreplaced by another adhoc or temporary employee; he\nmust be replaced only by a regularly selected employee.\nThis is necessary to avoid arbitrary action on the part of\nthe appointing authority.\n\nThirdly, even where an adhoc or temporary employment\nis necessitated on account of the exigencies of\nadministration, he should ordinarily be drawn from the\nemployment exchange unless it cannot brook delay in\nwhich case the pressing cause must be stated on the file.\nIf no candidate is available or is not sponsored by the\nemployment exchange, some appropriate method\nconsistent with the requirements of \nArticle 16\n should be\nfollowed. In other words, there must be a notice\npublished in the appropriate manner calling for\n\n 9\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\napplications and all those who apply in response thereto\nshould be considered fairly.\n\nAn unqualified person ought to be appointed only when\nqualified persons are not available through the above\nprocesses.\n\nIf for any reason, an adhoc or temporary employee is\ncontinued for a fairly long spell, the authorities must\nconsider his case for regularisation provided he is eligible\nand qualified according to rules and his service record is\nsatisfactory and his appointment does not run counter to\nthe reservation policy of the State.\n\nThe proper course would be that each States prepares a\nscheme, if one is not already in vogue, for regularisation\nof such employees consistent with its reservation policy\nand if a scheme is already framed, the same way be\nmade consistent with our observations herein so as to\nreduce avoidable litigation in this behalf. If and when\nsuch person is regularised he should be placed\nimmediately below the last regularly appointed employee\nin that category, class or service, as the case may be.\n\nSo far as the work-charged employees and casual labour\nare concerned, the effort must be to regularise them as\nfar as possible and as early as possible subject to their\nfulfilling the qualifications, if any, prescribed for the post\nand subject also to availability of work. If a casual\nlabourer is continued for a fairly long spell - say two or\nthree years - a presumption may arise that there is\nregular need for his services. In such a situation, it\nbecomes obligatory for the concerned authority to\nexamine the feasibility of his regularisation. While doing\nso, the authorities ought to adopt a positive approach\ncoupled with empathy for the person. As has been\nrepeatedly stressed by this court, security of tenure is\nnecessary for an employee to give his best to the job. In\nthis behalf, we do commend the orders of the Government\nof Haryana (contained in its letter dated 6.4.90 referred\nto hereinbefore) both in relation to work-charged\nemployees as well as casual labour.\n\nWe must also say that the orders issued by the\nGovernments of Punjab and Haryana providing for\nregularisation of adhoc/temporary employees who have\nput in two years/one year of service are quite generous\nand leave no room for any legitimate grievance by any\none.\n\nThese are but a few observations which we thought it\nnecessary to make, impelled by the facts of this case,\nand the spate of litigation by such employees. They are\nnot exhaustive nor can they be understood as immutable.\nEach Government or authority has to devise its own\ncriteria or principles for regularisation having regard to all\n\n 10\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n the relevant circumstances, but while doing so, it should\n bear in mind the observations made herein.\"\n\n6.2 Pursuant to \nthe above decision\n, Ministry of Personnel,\n\nPublic Grievances and Pensions (Deptt. of Personnel and\n\nTraining, Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status\n\nand Regularisation) Scheme came into force w.e.f.\n\n1.9.1993. The salient features of the said Scheme are\n\nreproduced as under:-\n\n \"3. This scheme is applicable to casual labourers in\n employment of the Ministries/Departments of\n Government of India and their attached and\n subordinate offices, on the date of issue of these\n orders. But it shall not be applicable to casual\n workers in Railways, Department of\n Telecommunication and Department of Posts who\n already have their own schemes.\n\n 4. Temporary Status\n\n (i) Temporary status would be conferred on all\n casual labourers who are in employment on the\n date of issue of this OM and who have rendered a\n continuous service of at least one year, which\n means that they must have been engaged for a\n period of at least 240 days (206 days in the case\n of offices observing 5 days week).\n\n (ii) Such conferment of temporary status would be\n without reference to the creation/availability of\n regular Group `D‟ posts.\n\n (iii) Conferment of temporary status on a casual\n labourer would not involve any change in his\n duties and responsibilities. The engagement will be\n on daily rates of pay on need basis. He may be\n deployed anywhere within the recruitment\n unit/territorial circle on the basis of availability of\n work.\n\n (iv) Such casual labourers who acquire temporary\n status will not, however, be brought on to the\n permanent establishment unless they are selected\n through regular selection process for Group `D‟\n posts.\n\n 11\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n5. Temporary status would entitle the casual\nlabourers to the following benefits:-\n\n(i) Wages at daily rates with reference to the\nminimum of the pay scale for a corresponding\nregular Group `D‟ official including DA, HRA and\nCCA\n\n(ii) Benefits of increments at the same rate as\napplicable to a Group `D‟ employee would be taken\ninto account for calculating pro-rata wages for\nevery one year of service subject to performance of\nduty for at least 240 days, 206 days in\nadministrative offices observing 5 days week) in\nthe year from the date of conferment of temporary\nstatus.\n\n(iii) Leave entitlement will be on a pro-rata basis at\nthe rate of one day for every 10 days of work,\ncasual or any other kind of leave, except maternity\nleave, will not be admissible. They will also be\nallowed to carry forward the leave at their credit on\ntheir regularisation. They will not be entitled to the\nbenefits of encashment of leave on termination of\nservice for any reason or on their quitting service.\n\n(iv) Maternity leave to lady casual labourers as\nadmissible to regular Group `D‟ employees will be\nallowed.\n\n(v) 50% of the service rendered under\ntemporary status would be counted for the\npurpose of retirement benefits after their\nregularisation.\n\n(vi) After rendering three years‟ continuous service\nafter conferment of temporary status, the casual\nlabourers would be treated on par with temporary\nGroup `D‟ employees for the purpose of contribution\nto the General Provident Fund, and would also\nfurther be eligible for the grant of Festival\nAdvance/Flood Advance on the same conditions as\nare applicable to temporary Group `D‟ employees,\nprovided they furnish two sureties from permanent\nGovernment servants of their Department.\n\n(vii) Until they are regularized, they would be\nentitled to Productivity Linked Bonus/ Ad- hoc\nbonus only at the rates as applicable to casual\nlabourers.\n\n6. No benefits other than those specified above will\nbe admissible to casual labourers with temporary\nstatus. However, if any additional benefits are\nadmissible to casual workers working in Industrial\nestablishments in view of provisions of Industrial\n\n 12\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nDisputes Act\n, they shall continue to be admissible\nto such casual labourers.\n\n7. Despite conferment of temporary status, the\nservices of a casual labourer may be dispensed\nwith by giving a notice of one month in writing. A\ncasual labourer with temporary status can also\nquit service by giving a written notice of one month.\nThe wages for the notice period will be payable\nonly for the days on which such casual worker is\nengaged on work.\n\n8. Procedure for filling up of Group `D‟ posts\n\n(i ) Two out of every three vacancies in Group `D‟\ncadres in respective offices where the casual\nlabourers have been working would be filled up as\nper extant recruitment rules and in accordance\nwith the instructions issued by Department of\nPersonnel and Training from amongst casual\nworkers with temporary status. However, regular\nGroup `D‟ staff rendered surplus for any reason\nwill have prior claim for absorption against\nexisting/future vacancies. In case of illiterate\ncasual labourers or those who fail to fulfill the\nminimum qualification prescribed for post,\nregularisation will be considered only against\nthose posts in respect of which literacy or lack of\nminimum qualification will not be a requisite\nqualification. They would be allowed age relaxation\nequivalent to the period for which they have\nworked continuously as casual labourer.\n\n9. On regularisation of casual worker with\ntemporary status, no substitute in his place will be\nappointed as he was not holding any post.\nViolation of this should be viewed very seriously\nand attention of the appropriate authorities should\nbe drawn to such cases for suitable disciplinary\naction against the officers violating these\ninstructions.\n\n10. In future, the guidelines as contained in this\nDepartment‟s OM dated 7.6.88 should be followed\nstrictly in the matter of engagement of casual\nemployees in Central Government offices.\n\n11. Department of Personnel and Training will\nhave the power to make amendments or relax any\nof the provisions in the scheme that may be\nconsidered necessary from time to time. \"\n\nThe applicant was granted termprorary status on\n15.3.1994.\n\n 13\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nFrom the above, it can been seen that vide Office Order\n\ndated 15.3.2004, the applicant was appointed as\n\n\"Watchman\", the said Office Order reads as under:-\n\n \"In pursuance of U.S.(PV), MEA, New Delhi‟s\n approval order No.V.IV/578/1/2003 dated 13.03.2004,\n Shri Giriraj Sharma, Casual Labourer holding temporary\n status Group „D‟ post wef 01-9-1993 vide RPO, Delhi\n Office Order No.1/18/86/Admn dated 15.3.2004, is\n appointed as Watchman (Gp.‟D‟) in this office with effect\n from 15.03.2004 (FN) in the scale of Rs.2550-55-2660-\n 60-3200.\n\n (i) The appointment is purely temporary and may\n be terminated at any time by a month‟s notice\n given by either side viz. the appointee or by\n appointing authority without assigning any\n reasons.

The method of recruitment namely direct\nrecruitment through Staff Selection Commission and\nthe promotion through LDCE are different and the\nsource of recruitment for both these are different.\nTherefore, there is absolutely no scope for bypassing\nthe statutory rules by the authorities concerned as\nstated in the reply statement. The respondent have\nnot replied to grounds a, b and c in the O.A. On the\nother hand, the respondents have stated that they\nhave gone out of their way and got the required\npermission to hold a Special qualifying Examination\nfor the benefit of the Casual workers. It is their further\nstand that since the recruitment through Staff\nSelection Commission is likely to take a long time,\nthey have decided to fill up the available vacancies by\neligible Group 'D' and Casual workers. The\nrespondents have failed to note that the Casual\nworkers are not eligible as per the statutory rules to\nappear for promotion since they are not regular\nworkers borne in the cadre of the Department.\nxxxxxx\n\n\"12. In the Notification calling for LDCE dated\n7.1.2005, there is no mention of eligibility of casual\nemployees for the said examination. Annexure A-IV\nclearly shows that the proposed examination is to be\nconducted for promotion of Group 'D' officials to the\ngrade of LDC and further Group 'D' officials of Central\nPassport Organisation who will be completing 5 years\nof regular service in Group 'D' post as on 31.5.2005\nand have passed Matriculation are eligible to appear\nin this examination. Contrary to this Circular, the\nApplication Form was issued making it appear that it\nis a combined examination for Group 'D' employees\nand Casual workers. This appears to be misreading of\nthe rules and an attempt has been made to permit the\npersons who are ineligible to be promoted through\nback door entry method of promotion. In so far as the\ncasual employees are concerned, they have to avail\nthemselves of the route of direct recruitment. As it is\nrightly argued, Group 'D' employees cannot be\ncombined with that of Casual workers and any such\npermission would be an arbitrary decision of treating\nthe unequals as equals. Casual workers are not in the\nfeeder category to compete along with Group 'D'\nemployees for promotion to the post of LDC. The\nrespondents' action amounts to bypassing the\n\n 17\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nstatutory rules by permitting the casual employees to\nappear for the examination intended for Group 'D'\nemployees. There is a separate provision for direct\nrecruitment through competitive examination under the\n75% of the vacancies. There is no scope for allowing\nthe casual employees in the vacancies for Group 'D'\nemployees.\n\n13. The respondents have enclosed certain documents\ni.e. Written communication/letters, the correspondence\nbetween the Secretary to the Department. It is not\nknown to what extent these correspondences may\noverride the statutory rules. The letter issued by the\nSecretary, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances\nand Pensions dated 9.8.2005 categorically says that\nthe DOPT could not agree to the proposal on the\nground that the scheme for Special Qualifying\nExamination approved by the DOPT in 1993 was the\nlast one and that all direct recruitment vacancies of\nClerks/Stenographers etc. thereafter were required to\nbe filled only through the normal Clerks Grade\nExamination conducted by the Staff Selection\nCommission and that regularisation in this manner\nwould be a case of back door entry and will have\nwide repercussions. The letter further says that the\nDepartment would have no objection if all such newly\nsanctioned Group 'D' posts are filled from amongst\ncasual employees. Ultimately, they say that the\nproblem can be sorted out by holding Special\nQualifying Examination as a one time measure. The\nletter further says that it is for the Ministry of External\nAffairs to decide whether Special Qualifying\nExamination is the comprehensive solution to the\nproblem they have been working for. Department of\nExpenditure may also be consulted. From the above\nletter, it is clear that the DOPT is the nodal agency for\napproval have not so far granted approval. That apart,\nunless the decision of the Government is issued in the\nform of a Govt. Order under \nArticle 73\n, the letter of\ncommunication cannot be taken as the decision of the\nGovernment so as to hold a Special Qualifying\nExamination. The said letter has no legal force and\ncannot be pressed into service to oppose the relief. In\nthe above circumstances, it is surprising as to how the\nAssistant Passport Officer who has sworn to the\naffidavit has taken a decision on behalf of the Ministry\nas stated in Paragraph 8 of the reply that this Ministry\nhas decided to fill up the available vacancies at LDC\nlevel by eligible Group 'D' and Casual workers. In\nParagraph 11 it is stated that they have gone out of\ntheir way and got the required permission to hold a\nSpecial Qualifying Examination for the benefit of the\nCasual Workers. No such specific permission is\npointed out or furnished before this Tribunal. In our\nview it is a blatant violation of the statutory rules and\nthe procedure of taking a policy decision without\n\n 18\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nreference to the relevant Department. We also note\nthat the reply statement in this O. A. is directly in\nconflict to the reply filed and the stand taken in O.A.\n73 of 2005.\n\n14. Casual Labourers (Grant of Temporary Status and\nRegularisation) Scheme of Government of India, 1993\ncame into force from 1.9.1993 also provides for\nprocedure for filling up of Group 'C posts for the\nCasual labourers who have been granted temporary\nstatus. The present method of selection is contrary to\nthe said scheme also. \nIn a recent judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nUnion of India v.\nGagan Kumar\n 2005 AIR SCW 3594 : 2005(3) SLJ 7\n(SC), held that the Clause 4 of the Scheme (Scheme of\n1993) does not appear to be a general guideline to be\napplied for the purpose of giving temporary status to\nall the casual workers, as and when they complete\none year's continuous service. Their Lordships held as\nfollows: \"Of course, it is up to the Union Government to\nformulate any Scheme as and when it is found\nnecessary that the casual labourers are to be given\ntemporary status and later they are to be absorbed in\nGroup 'D' posts. Therefore, there is no scope of the\nCasual labourers to straightaway seek for\nappointment to Group 'C posts.\n\n15. In so far as the regularisation of casual workers\nrecruited to perform duties of Group 'C posts, Ministry\nof Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions\n(Department of Personnel and Training) in O.M. No.\n49014/16/89-Estt.(C) dated 16.7.1990 laid down\ncertain guidelines. In the year 1990 as a one time\nmeasure, Government decided to allow age relaxation\netc. for the purpose of recruitment. Paragraph 6 of the\nO.M. says that the relaxation given to the casual\nworkers will be available only for next examination to\nbe conducted by the Staff Selection Commission for\nthe recruitment to the posts of LDCs and\nStenographers. It will be the responsibility of the\nadministrative Ministries/Departments, where the\ncasual worker is employed at the time of issue of\nthese instructions to ensure that the casual workers\nintending to appear in the relevant examination\nconducted by the Staff Selection Commission satisfy\nall the conditions prescribed in the O.M. Paragraph JO\nrelevant for our purpose is as follows: \"It is once again\nreiterated that there is a complete ban on engagement\nof casual workers for performing duties of Group 'C\nposts and hence no appointment of casual worker\nshould be made in future for performing duties of\nGroup 'C posts. If any deviation in this regard is\ncommitted, the administrative officer incharge, in the\nrank ofJoint Secretary or equivalentwill be held\nresponsible for the same\", (emphasis added). It is after\nthis Government of order of 1990, the Casual\nLabourers (Grant of Temporary Status and\n\n 19\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nRegularisation) Scheme of Government of India 1993\ncame into being. As per the 1993 Scheme casual\nworkers who are given temporary status are permitted\nto be regularised to Group 'D' posts only. \nTherefore, it\nis not open to the second respondent to take a policy\ndecision to hold an examination through LDCE\nintended only for permanent Government servants of\nthe Central Government viz. Group 'D'. It is nothing but\nbypassing the statutory rules and the Government of\nIndia instructions. It will be permiting back door entry\nof casual employees to Group 'C service detrimental to\nefficiency of service and breed seeds of corruption and\nnepotism (vide judgment in \nState of H.P. v. Suresh\nKumar Verma\n of the Hon'ble Supreme Court \nreferred\nto above\n).\n\n16 & 17. Regularisation of Casual employees in\npermanent service requires a policy decision of the\nGovernment since there may be thousands or more in\nvarious departments of Government, Railways, Postal\nServices throughout the country. A decision cannot be\ntaken in isolation without considering the implications\nof service and financial commitment.\n\n18. Hence, we have no hesitation to hold that the\nproposed action of the respondents is clearly illegal\nand arbitrary and the applicants have made out a\ncase for grant of the relief sought for in this O.A. We\nallow the O.A. accordingly. No order as to costs.\n\nxxxxxx\n\n21. Before parting with the case we are constrained to\nexpress our concern at the conflicting stand taken by\nthe second respondent in reference to regularising the\nservices of casual employees with temporary status.\nThe second respondent has pressed into service the\ninternal communication of the Department to address\nthe arguments which is as a matter of fact giving up\nthe stand taken in O.A, 73 of 2005. When we have\ndeclined to look into the internal correspondence of the\nDepartment especially the letter dated 9.8.2005 to\ntake a different stand in O.A. 73 of 2005 a different\nCounsel Mr. M.T. Arunan representing O.A. No. 702\nhas included this correspondence along with the reply\nstatement. The reply is consciously silent as to the\nstand of the first respondent. Thus it is seen that the\nconsistent stand of the Union of India in reference to\nregularisation is sought to be given a go bye in their\nreply. We are unable to accept the case of the\nrespondent for the reasons set out above. However,\nwe are constrained to observe that when the\nDepartmental Heads are taking a stand it can never\nbe contrary to the Government of India's stand. It has\n\n 20\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n rightly been observed that guidelines are being\n observed more in breach than their implementation.\n More often than not the administrative authorities and\n in disregard to the guidelines, thereby affording the\n employees unintended opportunities to seek\n regularisation of their services through Courts and\n Tribunals etc. In spite of warning that disciplinary\n action will be taken, that has not resulted in the\n desired effect. We feel that this is an appropriate case\n for the first respondent to take appropriate action\n against officers concerned and to issue suitable\n guidelines to the Counsels representing the cases\n before the Tribunal. Copies of this order shall be\n communicated to the first respondent and to the\n Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and\n Pensions, Govt. of India, New Delhi directly by the\n Registry.\"\n\n6.4 Thereafter, vide Office Order dated 21.7.2008, the\n\napplicant was promoted as LDC pursuant to above\n\nexamination under 25% quota, persons eligible are Group 'D'\n\nemployees with 5 years of regular service in their grade\n\nrendered after appointment, the said office Order is\n\nreproduced as under:-\n\n \"Consequent upon the promotion of Shri Giriraj Sharma,\n Daftry, to the post of LDC (Grade VII) of Central Passport\n Organization in Regional Passport Office, Delhi, with effect\n from 09.07.2008 (FN) vide Ministry‟s Office Order\n No.V.IV/578/2/2006 dated 10th July, 2008, on the basis\n of the result of Limited Departmental Examination held on\n 20.05.2006, his pay has been fixed at Rs.3575/- in the\n pay scale of Rs.3050-75-3950-80-4590, as under:-\n\n Existing Basic Pay raised by Pay fixed on Date of next\n Pay in the pay adding one promotion to increment\n scale of Rs.2610- notional the post of (subject to\n 60-3150-65-3540 increment in LDC w.e.f. passing\n the lower post 09.07.2008 typewriting\n or Rs.100/- test)\n whichever is\n more w.e.f.\n\n 09.07.2008\n\n 21\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n Rs.3410/- Rs.3510/- Rs.3575 01.07.2009\n\n6.5 The applicant preferred an RTI dated 16.7.2009\n\nseeking following information:-\n\n \"I appeal to you to kindly provide me the following\n information under \nRTI Act\n, Postal Order of Rs.Ten only\n bearing number 77E 335421 dated 15.07.2009 is\n enclosed.\n\n (i) Services of Casual employees engaged in\n Passport Offices, Cochin, Trivandrum and\n Kozhikode were regularized and after\n regularization of their services, some of them\n approached hon'ble C‟T in accordance to the\n directives of CAT Ernakulam, date of their\n regular appointment was changed to the initial\n date of engagement as casual employee.

These deficiencies are\n overlooked by way of granting of relaxation and,\n therefore, care must be taken to see that they do\n not upset the seniorities of regular appointees.\n Whether they qualify in a given case or not is not\n relevant but what is relevant is that regularisation\n should be prospective and not retrospective as the\n chances of their upsetting the seniorities cannot be\n overlooked.\"\n\n6.11 The Full Bench of this Tribunal at Ernakulam in\n\nO.A.Nos.75/2010, 82/2010 & 196/2010 in \nSmt. K. U.\n\nSobhana\n (supra) where all the above O.As came before the\n\nFull Bench on a reference made by the Division Bench,\n\nfinding that the order in O.A.82/08 was in conflict with the\n\norder in O.A.1557/98 on the question as to whether the\n\ncasual employees subsequently regularized were entitled\n\nfor seniority reckoned from the date of their initial\n\nappointment or not and held as under:-\n\n \"13. \nIn \nRabindra Nath Bose and others vs.\n Union of India and others\n; AIR 1970 SC 470,\n the Apex Court declared that it is settled\n that \nArticle 13\n of the Constitution has no\n retrospective effect and therefore, any action taken\n before the commencement of the Constitution in\n pursuance of the provisions of any law which was\n a valid law at the time when such action was\n taken cannot be challenged and the law under\n which such action was taken cannot be\n questioned as unconstitutional and void on the\n score of its infringing the fundamental rights\n enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.\n \nIn \nUsha\n Devi v. State of Kerala\n;2002 (1) KLT 615, it was\n observed by the Hon'ble High Court of Kerala that\n rank list cannot be challenged after it had become\n\n 25\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nfinal and after a long delay and unsettle the\nsettled position for years.\n\n14. The applicants in O.A.196/10 joined the\nservice on regular basis after following the regular\nselection process as early as in 1982,\nsubsequently got promoted to the next higher\ncadre as UDC in 1992,1994 and 1996 respectively\nand again promoted as Assistants and\nSuperintendents. Thus, by virtue of their seniority\nwhich they enjoyed for a long period and having\nbeen promoted successfully to the next higher post\nfrom time to time, cannot be upset by conferring\nseniority on the casual employees not regularly\nrecruited after following the same procedure as\nwas applicable to the regular recruitment and to\nhave a march over the regularly recruited\nemployees. Therefore, even though they had been\nin service as casual employees they are entitled\nfor all the other benefits other than seniority. The\ncasual employees as of right could claim seniority\nonly when they became qualified by successfully\npassing in the examination. Their retrospective\nregularization is good enough for all purposes\nother than seniority. Accordingly, we answer the\nissue as follows:-\n\n15. The casual employees are entitled to be\nregularized with effect from their initial\nengagement and will be entitled for all other\nconsequential benefits other than seniority and\nmonetary benefit.\n\n16. The Division Bench while considering the\nmatter before reference have already held that the\nO.A. is maintenable. In the circumstances based\non the answer as given above we allow this O.A.\nand quash Annexure A1 to the extent it directed\nthat the party respondents who are the applicants\nin O.A.Nos. 297,299 & 300 of 2008 are entitled to\nhigher promotion based on the revised seniority.\n\nWe declare that the party respondents are not\nentitled for seniority from the date of their initial\nengagement as casual employees over the\napplicants. In the light of the reference answered,\nwe declare that the applicants in O.A. No.75/2010\nand O.A.No.82 /2010 are not entitled to claim\nseniority as LDC with effect from date of their\ninitial entry into the service on casual basis.\nO.A.No.75/10 is dismissed. As regards the reliefs\nsought for in O.A No.82/10 is concerned, the\nreliefs sought for to revise seniority in the category\nof LDC from the date of initial appointment and to\npay the arrears of salary from the date of initial\nengagement, are dismissed. However, the\napplicants will be entitled for all other\n\n 26\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n consequential benefits other than seniority and\n monetary benefits, as was given to the applicants\n in O.A.No.1557/08, if not already granted.\"\n\n6.12 We have been informed that the above Full Bench\n\ndecision has been implemented in letter and spirit by the\n\nrespondents.\n\n6.13 It is also noticeble that even before the decision of\n\nthe Full Bench, the Judgment dated 14.7.2003 and\n\njudgment dated 13.6.2005 were implemented vide Office\n\nOrder dated 23.09.2005 by the respondents, the same is\n\nreproduced as under:-\n\n \"In pursuance of CAT (Ernakulam Bench)‟s judgment\n dated 14.07.2003 in OA No.1557/98 & OA No.436/2005 dataed\n 13.06.2005 Smt.

The applicant was regularized vide\n\ncommunication dated 15.3.2004 to the post of Group \"D‟\n\nWatchman. For purpose of regularisation, it appears that\n\nthe only pre-condition was to qualify a Special Examination\n\nunder 25% quota, persons eligible are Group 'D' employees\n\nwith 5 years of regular service in their grade rendered after\n\nappointment (which the applicant qualified in the year\n\n2005). Thereafter, once the applicant had qualified the\n\n 28\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nsaid examination, he ought to have been extended the\n\nbenefit of regularization from the date of his initial\n\nengagement with similarly situated persons irrespective of\n\ncategory either Group \"C\" or Group \"D\" inasmuch as even\n\nthough the others, who qualified the examination in year\n\n1993 and 1997, they were regularized from initial date of\n\nengagement subject to the conditions that said persons\n\nincluding the applicant shall only be entitled to for all other\n\nconsequential benefits on notional basis other than\n\nseniority and monetary benefits. The 1993 Scheme itself\n\nenvisaged for counting of past services as evident from the\n\nclause 5 (v) ie 50% of the service rendered under\n\ntemporary status would be counted for the purpose of\n\nretirement benefits after their regularization. It is also\n\nborne out from the records that vide Office Order dated\n\n23.9.2005 (casual labourer at page 25 of written\n\nsubmissions) and Office Order (date illegible at page 40 of\n\nwritten submissions) Daily Rated Clerks were extended\n\nsimilar benefits without any distinction.\n\n6.17 This issue is no more res integra in view of the\n\ndecision of the Full Bench of this Tribunal in identical\n\nmatters titled as Smt.

[OA\n\nNo.174/2012 decided by the Hyderabad Bench of this\n\nTribunal on 25.08.2014], wherein the applicants, who had\n\nbeen appointed as casual labourers between 1985 and\n\n1997, subsequently regularized as Group-D employees, and\n\nfurther promoted as LDC during 2002 to 2007, sought\n\nregularization from the date of their initial engagement on\n\nthe strength of the order passed by the Ernakulam Bench\n\nin OA No.758/2007 and OA No.32/2008, which were\n\nclubbed together and decided by a common order dated\n\n15.01.2009 directing the respondents to regularize their\n\nservices w.e.f. their respective dates of appointment as\n\ncasual labourers with consequential benefits including\n\narrears of pay except seniority in the cadre of LDC. \nThe\n\nsaid decision was challenged before the Hon‟ble High Court\n\nof Kerala in WP(C) No.23813/2009 and 26263/2009 and\n\nthe same were dismissed vide judgment dated 28.06.2010\n\nrelying upon the decision of the Hon‟ble Apex Court in \nUP\n\n 30\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nState Electricity Board vs. Pooran Chandra Pandey &\n\nOrs.\n [2007 (\n1) SCC 92] and Secretary, State of\n\nKaranataka & Ors vs. Umadevi & Ors.\n [2006 (4) SSC 1].\n\n6.19 In compliance of the aforesaid decision, the\n\napplicants therein had also been granted the benefit of\n\nregularization of services with effect from their date of\n\ninitial engagement as casual labourers, including arrears of\n\npay. Thus, the aforesaid decision of the Ernakulam Bench\n\nas upheld by the Hon‟ble High Court of Kerala and\n\nimplemented by the respondents themselves as also the\n\ndecision of the Hyderabad Bench in V. Srinivas (supra) are\n\nbinding on us. Apart from this, the decision of the Full\n\nBench of this Tribunal in Smt. K.U. Sobhana (supra) is\n\nalso binding on us being Full Bench decision.\n\n6.20 It is noticed that on 13.12.2022, we sought\n\nclarification from the learned counsel for the respondents\n\non one important point „whether the applicant herein was\n\ninitially engaged as Casual Labour in Group-C or Group-D\n\nand similarly in the citations quoted therein whether those\n\napplicants had been engaged initially as Casual Labour in\n\nGroup-D or in Group-C. To the said point, learned counsel\n\nfor the respondents could not answer the same and sought\n\nfurther time to check the details with the respondents.\n\n 31\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\nEven on 17.02.2023 on which date the order was reserved,\n\nhe could not clarify the aforesaid position.\n\n6.21 In view of the above discussion and the law on the\n\nsubject referred to above, we are left with no option but to\n\nallow the claim of the applicant following the decision of the\n\nFull Bench in Smt. K.U. Sobhana (supra), common order\n\ndated 15.01.2019 passed by the Ernakulam Bench in OA\n\nNo.758/2007 and OA No.32/2008 upheld by the Hon‟ble\n\nHigh Court of Kerala, decision of the Ernakulam Bench of\n\nthis Tribunal in \nRavindranath V.K. & Ors. vs. UOI &\n\nOrs.\n (supra) and A.R. Parameswaran & Ors. vs. UOI &\n\nOrs. (supra).\n\n6.22 In conspectus of the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase, the instant OA is allowed with a direction to the\n\nrespondents to regularize the services of the applicant from\n\nthe date of his initial engagement as causal labour/worker\n\nfor all purposes other than seniority and monetary, namely,\n\neligibility to appear in the promotion tests or examinations,\n\nand for terminal benefits etc. The respondents are further\n\ndirected to issue appropriate orders notionally fixing his\n\npay and date of regularization accordingly.\n\n 32\n\n OA No.1392 of 2016\n\n6.23 The exercise, as ordained above, shall be completed\n\nby the respondents within a period of three months from\n\nthe date of receipt of a certified copy of this order.\n\n6.24 No order as to costs.\n\n(Manish Garg) (Anand Mathur)\n Member (J) Member (A)\n/na/",

The letter further says that the\nDepartment would have no objection if all such newly\nsanctioned Group 'D' posts are filled from amongst\ncasual employees. Ultimately, they say that the\nproblem can be sorted out by holding Special\nQualifying Examination as a one time measure.
