Admitted facts are as follows; The first petitioner had married\n\nthe defacto complainant on 27/4/2009. Thereafter, they resided\n\ntogether for some time. The second petitioner is his father and the\n\nthird petitioner is his mother. A girl child was born, who is aged 7\n\nyears now. Matrimonial dispute arose between the parties. It is stated\n\nthat, on 5/9/2017, the wife left the matrimonial home. The child was\n\nin the custody of the petitioners till 15/9/2017, on which day the child\n\nwas entrusted with the parents of the defacto complainant. The\n\npresent complaint was laid by the wife alleging that the first\n\npetitioner had sexually abused the seven year old girl on few days\n\nbetween 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017 at the matrimonial home and other\n\nplaces. Apprehending arrest, the petitioners herein have approached\n\n\fBA No. 4054/2018 2\n\nthis court.\n\n 3. The specific contention of the petitioners herein is that,\n\nthe defacto complainant was a quarrelsome person and matrimonial\n\nrelationship became incompatible. It was alleged that, the defacto\n\ncomplainant had developed a close intimacy with one doctor who\n\nwas younger to her. She was found making secret audio and video\n\ncalls to him over the mobile phone. When the relationship went\n\nbeyond a limit, the husband intervened and she was warned. It was\n\nlater understood that she continued to maintain even physical\n\nrelationship with him. On being confronted with materials, she is\n\nstated to have abandoned the child and left the matrimonial home\n\non 5/9/2017. Thereafter, the first petitioner herein entrusted the\n\nchild to the defacto complainant and her parents, considering the\n\neducation of the child. The first petitioner herein initiated\n\nmatrimonial proceedings, including an application for custody of the\n\nchild. The present complaint was filed belatedly raising absolutely\n\nfalse allegations with the intention of denying him the custody of\n\nthe child. It was vehemently contended that, the first petitioner\n\nherein has not committed any sexual abuse on the minor girl and it\n\nwas purposefully and belatedly set up.\n\n 4. Annexure A1 is a copy of the petition in O.P.(HMA) No.\n\n649/2017 dated 27/10/2017 filed by the first petitioner herein before\n\nthe Family Court, Malappuram. He claimed divorce on the ground of\n\n\fBA No. 4054/2018 3\n\nadultery of the defacto complainant with the doctor, who was\n\narrayed as the second respondent in that O.P. It was alleged therein\n\nthat, she was having continuous physical relationship with that\n\ndoctor and was caught with evidence. Annexure A2 is a copy of\n\nO.P.( G & W) No. 356/2018 filed by the first petitioner herein on\n\n24/5/2018 before the Family Court, Malappuram claiming custody of\n\nthe child. Thereafter,Crime was got registered by the wife at\n\nBangalore as Crime No. 703/2017 on 11/12/2017 against the\n\npetitioners herein alleging matrimonial cruelty. The first petitioner\n\nsought bail which was granted by Annexure A3 order. It is seen\n\nthat, she alleged that the petitioners herein committed acts of\n\nmatrimonial cruelty and demanded dowry and thereby committed\n\noffences punishable under \nsection 498A\n IPC and the provisions of\n\nthe \nDowry Prohibition Act\n. The petitioner was granted anticipatory\n\nbail. Annexure A5 is a complaint filed by the defacto complainant\n\nbefore the State Commission for Protection of Child Child Rights of\n\nKerala and Karnataka, with copies to the various authorities. It was\n\nalleged that, the father-in-law of the defacto complainant had made\n\nsexual advances towards her. She alleged that, in-laws had\n\nadministered various medicines on her body. It was also alleged that,\n\nthe child was physically assaulted by the petitioners during the\n\nperiod from 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017. There is an allegation that, the\n\ngrandfather used to beat her on her groin and grand mother had\n\n\fBA No. 4054/2018 4\n\nbeaten the child with a chapathy rolling pin. Annexure A6 is the\n\ncomplaint No.20/2018 filed on 24/1/2018 by the defacto complainant\n\nunder the provisions of the \nProtection of Women from Domestic\n\nViolence Act\n.\n\n 5. The above documents clearly show that, at no point of time\n\nearlier, the defacto complainant had a case that the child was\n\nsexually abused by the father. Even though physical assault is\n\nalleged against the petitioners, there was absolutely no reference\n\nanywhere that the child was subjected to sexual abuse by the father.\n\n 6. It seems that, for the first time such a complaint is seen\n\nraised in the present crime(Crime No.548/2018 of Ottappalam Police\n\nstation). Crime was thereupon registered for offences punishable\n\nunder \nsections 7\n & \n8\n of POCSO Act and \nSection 75\n of the Juvenile\n\nJustice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015. The crux of the\n\nallegation in the FIS is that, during the period when the child was in\n\nthe custody of the petitioners, the father of the child used to give her\n\na bath. He used to undress her, remove his dress and give her bath.\n\nIt was stated that in the course of bathing her, the first petitioner\n\nused to tickle her. The child has stated that, she did not like boys\n\ngiving her bath. Pursuant to it, \nsection 164\n Cr.P.C.statement of the\n\nvictim was also recorded, which is substantially in tune with FI\n\nstatement.\n\n 7. It is pertinent to note that the only allegation raised against\n\n\fBA No. 4054/2018 5\n\nthe first petitioner is as above. Even if the entire statement made\n\nby the child is taken at its face value, crucial question that arises is\n\nwhether the father had any sexual intent while giving the daughter a\n\nbath. This has to be appreciated in the background that the\n\nallegation comes only at a highly belated stage, when the father\n\nhimself had sought custody of the child. No explanation is\n\nforthcoming for the delay in giving complaint. Hence, the question\n\nto be investigated by the police is only whether the first petitioner\n\nherein with sexual intention had committed any act. For that,\n\ncustodial interrogation does not appear to be warranted. It is also\n\nclear that, in such a very strained matrimonial relationship a\n\nbelated allegation of this nature has to be considered carefully and it\n\nmay not be safe to order custodial interrogation.\n\n 8. Having regard to the above, I am inclined to grant benefit of\n\nanticipatory bail to the petitioners herein subject to the following\n\nconditions:\n\n i). Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer\n\nwithin ten days from today and shall undergo interrogation.\n\nThereafter, if they are proposed to be arrested, they shall be\n\nreleased on bail on each of the petitioner executing a bond for a sum\n\nof Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand only) with two sureties for the\n\nlike sum each.\n\n\fBA No. 4054/2018 6\n\n ii). They shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and\n\nwhen called for and co-operate with the investigation.\n\n Anticipatory Bail Application is allowed.\n\n Sd/-\n\n SUNIL THOMAS\n Judge\ndpk\n\n /true copy/ PS to Judge.",
