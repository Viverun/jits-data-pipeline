JAIN\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 11 OF 2002\n\nDr. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.\n\n1. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned\nSingle Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court upholding the\nconviction of the appellant for offences punishable under\n\nSections 304 B\nand\n498 A\nof the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in\nshort the '\nIPC\n'). Sentence of seven years was imposed on each\ncount. By the impugned judgment conviction recorded in\nrespect of co-accused Laxmi was set aside and she was\ndirected to be acquitted.\n\n2. Background facts as projected by prosecution in a\nnutshell are as follows:\n\nPadma @ Pitchamma (hereinafter referred to as the\n'deceased') was married to accused No.1-Srinivasulu on\n21.5.1989. At the time of marriage, PW.1 father of the\ndeceased gave rupees 10,000/- in cash, five tolas of gold, other\nhousehold articles worth Rs.3000/- and Rs.1200/- towards\nclothes to accused No.1, who was employed as sub-staff of\nKarnataka Bank, Secunderabad. Accused No.2 is the mother\nof accused No.1 and she used to visit accused No.1 in the city\nand did not allow the deceased to fulfil conjugal obligations. At\nthe instigation of accused No.2, accused No.1 had demanded\nRs.5,000/- more from the parents of the deceased to purchase\na Scooter as additional dowry. PW.1, father of the deceased\npaid the said amount to accused No.1. In spite of the same,\nboth the accused made repeated demands for additional dowry\nupon the deceased. On one occasion, a sum of Rs.1,000/- and\non another occasion a sum of Rs.2,000/- was paid by PW.1 to\nthe accused. But the accused persons did not stop ill-\n\ntreatment and harassment towards the deceased. After some\ntime, when the deceased and her parents came to know that\naccused No.2 was thinking of a second marriage of accused\nNo.1, immediately they went to the house of the accused but\naccused No.1 refused to take the deceased into the house.\nAccused No.2 ill-treated the deceased and both the accused\nasked the deceased to go back to her parents' house. Accused\nNo.1 threatened to immolate the deceased and accused No.2\nthreatened to poison the deceased and insisted that she\ncontinues to stay in the house of her parents. Therefore, the\ndeceased was taking shelter in the house of her parents and\nabout 2 months prior to the incident, on the assurance given\nby both the accused before the elders, the deceased joined\naccused Nos.1 and 2 to fulfil conjugal obligations. In spite of\nthe same, the accused continued ill-treatment and\nharassment for more dowry. Because of the persistent ill-\ntreatment and cruelty meted out by the accused towards the\ndeceased, on 17.9.1992 at about 9.30 a.m. the deceased set\nherself ablaze and died with 100% burn injuries in Gandhi\nHospital while undergoing treatment.\n\nFirst information report was filed, investigation was\nundertaken and on completion thereof charge sheet was filed.\nAccused persons pleaded innocence.\n\n3. To establish its accusations prosecution examined 11\nwitnesses and 16 documents were exhibited. PWs. 1 and 2\nwere the father and mother of the deceased respectively while\nPW3 was a relative. PW4 was a brother of the deceased while\nPW5 was the sister of the deceased. PW 6 was a caste elder.\nPW 10 is the Doctor who conducted the autopsy while PW 11\nwas the investigating officer. On consideration of the evidence\non record, learned II Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge,\nHyderabad convicted the appellant for offence punishable\nunder\nSection 304B\nand sentenced him to undergo\nimprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-\nwith default stipulation. The acquitted co-accused A2 i.e. the\nmother of the appellant was sentenced to undergo\nimprisonment for seven years. Though the accused person was\nfound guilty for offence punishable under\nSection 498A\nno\nseparate sentence was imposed. Questioning correctness of\nthe trial court's judgment, an appeal was preferred before the\nHigh Court by both the accused. It was essentially the stand\nof the appellant before the High Court that there was no\nmaterial to show any demand of dowry and therefore neither\n\nSection 498A\nnor\nSection 304B\nhad any application. It was\npointed out that the deceased stayed for only 12 days at the\nmatrimonial home. Reference was made to several letters\nwhich clearly establish that the deceased was unhappy not\nbecause of any demand of dowry but because the appellant\nused to stay most of the times with the parents and the\nmother in law was taking objection to her long absence from\nthe marital home. The High Court did not find any substance\nin the stand of the appellant but found that there was no\nmaterial to show that the co-accused i.e. the mother in law\nwas guilty of the charged offences. Accordingly her conviction\nwas set aside and she was acquitted. However, in case of the\nappellant the conviction was maintained and the sentence was\nreduced as afore-stated.\n\n4. In support of the appeal, it was submitted that there is\nno evidence of any dowry demand. On the contrary, the letters\non which prosecution placed reliance indicated that the\ndispute was not relating to demand of dowry but was on\naccount of normal marital discord.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand\nsupported the impugned judgment.\n\n6.\nSection 304B\nIPC deals with dowry death which reads as\nfollows:\n\n\"304B. Dowry Death- (1) Where the death of a\nwoman is caused by any burns or bodily\ninjury or occurs otherwise than under normal\ncircumstances within seven years of her\nmarriage and it is shown that soon before her\ndeath she was subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any relative of\nher husband for, or in connection with any\ndemand for dowry, such death shall be called\n\"dowry death\" and such husband or relative\nshall be deemed to have caused her death.\n\nExplanation \u0016 For the purpose of this sub-\nsection 'dowry' shall have same meaning as in\n\nSection 2\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n(28 of 1961).\n\n(2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be\npunished with imprisonment for a term which\nshall not be less than seven years but which\nmay extend to imprisonment for life.\"\n\n7. The provision has application when death of a woman is\ncaused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than\nunder normal circumstances within seven years of her\nmarriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any\nrelatives of her husband for, or in connection with any\ndemand for dowry. In order to attract application of\nSection\n304B\nIPC, the essential ingredients are as follows:-\n\n(i) The death of a woman should be caused by burns\nor bodily injury or otherwise than under a normal\ncircumstance.\n\n(ii) Such a death should have occurred within seven\nyears of her marriage.\n\n(iii) She must have been subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or any relative of her\nhusband.\n\n(iv) Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in\nconnection with demand of dowry.\n\n(v) Such cruelty or harassment is shown to have been\nmeted out to the woman soon before her death.\n\n8.\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act is also relevant for the\ncase at hand. Both\nSection 304B\nIPC and\nSection 113B\nof the\nEvidence Act were inserted as noted earlier by the\nDowry\nProhibition (Amendment) Act\n43 of 1986 with a view to combat\nthe increasing menace of dowry deaths. Section 113B reads as\nfollows:-\n\n\"113B: Presumption as to dowry death- When\nthe question is whether a person has\ncommitted the dowry death of a woman and it\nis shown that soon before her death such\nwoman has been subjected by such person to\ncruelty or harassment for, or in connection\nwith, any demand for dowry, the Court shall\npresume that such person had caused the\ndowry death.\n\nExplanation \u0016 For the purposes of this section\n'dowry death' shall have the same meaning as\nin\nSection 304-B\nof the Indian Penal Code (45\nof 1860).\"\n\n9. The necessity for insertion of the two provisions has been\namply analysed by the Law Commission of India in its 21st\nReport dated 10th August, 1988 on 'Dowry Deaths and Law\nReform'. Keeping in view the impediment in the pre-existing\nlaw in securing evidence to prove dowry related deaths,\nlegislature thought it wise to insert a provision relating to\npresumption of dowry death on proof of certain essentials. It\nis in this background presumptive Section 113B in the\n\nEvidence Act\nhas been inserted. As per the definition of\n'dowry death' in\nSection 304B\nIPC and the wording in the\npresumptive\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act, one of the\nessential ingredients, amongst others, in both the provisions\nis that the concerned woman must have been \"soon before her\ndeath\" subjected to cruelty or harassment \"for or in\nconnection with the demand of dowry\". Presumption under\nSection 113B is a presumption of law. On proof of the\nessentials mentioned therein, it becomes obligatory on the\nCourt to raise a presumption that the accused caused the\ndowry death. The presumption shall be raised only on proof of\nthe following essentials:\n\n(1) The question before the Court must be\nwhether the accused has committed the\ndowry death of a woman. (This means that\nthe presumption can be raised only if the\naccused is being tried for the offence under\n\nSection 304B\nIPC).\n\n(2) The woman was subjected to cruelty or\nharassment by her husband or his relatives.\n(3) Such cruelty or harassment was for, or\nin connection with any demand for dowry.\n(4) Such cruelty or harassment was soon\nbefore her death.\n\n10. A conjoint reading of\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act\nand\nSection 304B\nIPC shows that there must be material to\nshow that soon before her death the victim was subjected to\ncruelty or harassment. Prosecution has to rule out the\npossibility of a natural or accidental death so as to bring it\nwithin the purview of the 'death occurring otherwise than in\nnormal circumstances'. The expression 'soon before' is very\nrelevant where\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act and\nSection\n304B\nIPC are pressed into service. Prosecution is obliged to\nshow that soon before the occurrence there was cruelty or\nharassment and only in that case presumption operates.\nEvidence in that regard has to be led by prosecution. 'Soon\nbefore' is a relative term and it would depend upon\ncircumstances of each case and no strait-jacket formula can\nbe laid down as to what would constitute a period soon before\nthe occurrence. It would be hazardous to indicate any fixed\nperiod, and that brings in the importance of a proximity test\nboth for the proof of an offence of dowry death as well as for\nraising a presumption under\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence\nAct. The expression 'soon before her death' used in the\nsubstantive\nSection 304B\nIPC and\nSection 113B\nof the\nEvidence Act is present with the idea of proximity test. No\ndefinite period has been indicated and the expression 'soon\nbefore' is not defined. A reference to expression 'soon after'\nused in\nSection 114\n(illustration (a)) of the\nEvidence Act\nis\nrelevant. It lays down that a Court may presume that a man\nwho is in the possession of goods soon after the theft, is either\nthe thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen,\nunless he can account for his possession. The determination\nof the period which can come within the term 'soon before' is\nleft to be determined by the Courts, depending upon facts and\ncircumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to indicate that\nthe expression 'soon before' would normally imply that the\ninterval should not be much between the concerned cruelty or\nharassment and the death in question. There must be\nexistence of a proximate and live-link between the effect of\ncruelty based on dowry demand and the concerned death. If\nalleged incident of cruelty is remote in time and has become\nstale enough not to disturb mental equilibrium of the woman\nconcerned, it would be of no consequence.\n\n11. Section 498A reads as follows:\n\n\"498A: Husband or relative of husband of a\nwoman subjecting her to cruelty- Whoever,\nbeing the husband or the relative of the\nhusband of a woman, subjects such woman\nto cruelty shall be punished with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to\nthree years and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nExplanation \u0016 For the purpose of this section\n'cruelty' means \u0016\n\n(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a\nnature as is likely to drive the woman to\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or\ndanger to life, limb or health (whether mental\nor physical) of the woman; or\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such\nharassment is with a view to coercing her or\nany person related to her to meet any\nunlawful demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity or is on account of failure by her or\nany person related to her to meet such\ndemand.\"\n\n12. Consequences of cruelty which are likely to drive a\nwoman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to\nlife, limb or health, whether mental or physical of the woman\nis required to be established in order to bring home the\napplication of\nSection 498A\nIPC. Cruelty has been defined in\nthe Explanation for the purpose of Section 498A. Substantive\n\nSection 498A\nIPC and presumptive\nSection 113B\nof the\nEvidence Act have been inserted in the respective statutes by\nCriminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983. It is to be noted\nthat\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\n, IPC cannot be held to be\nmutually inclusive. These provisions deal with two distinct\noffences. It is true that cruelty is a common essential to both\nthe Sections and that has to be proved. The Explanation to\nSection 498A gives the meaning of 'cruelty'. In Section 304B\nthere is no such explanation about the meaning of 'cruelty'.\nBut having regard to common background to these offences it\nhas to be taken that the meaning of 'cruelty' or 'harassment' is\nthe same as prescribed in the Explanation to Section 498A\nunder which 'cruelty' by itself amounts to an offence. Under\nSection 304B it is 'dowry death' that is punishable and such\ndeath should have occurred within seven years of marriage.\n\nNo such period is mentioned in Section 498A. A person\ncharged and acquitted under Section 304B can be convicted\nunder Section 498A without that charge being there, if such a\ncase is made out. If the case is established, there can be a\nconviction under both the sections. (See\nAkula Ravinder and\nothers v. The State of Andhra Pradesh\n(AIR 1991 SC 1142).\n\nSection 498A\nIPC and\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act\ninclude in their amplitude past events of cruelty. Period of\noperation of\nSection 113B\nof the Evidence Act is seven years,\npresumption arises when a woman committed suicide within a\nperiod of seven years from the date of marriage.\n\n13.\nSection 2\nof the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (in short\n'\nDowry Act\n') defines \"dowry\" as under:-\n\nSection 2\n. Definition of 'dowry' \u0016 In this Act,\n'dowry' means any property or valuable\nsecurity given or agreed to be given either\ndirectly or indirectly \u0016\n\n(a) by one party to a marriage to the\nother party to the marriage; or\n\n(b) by the parents of either party to a\nmarriage or by any other person, to\neither party to the marriage or to any\nother person,\n\nat or before or any time after the marriage in\nconnection with the marriage of the said\nparties, but does not include dower or mehr\nin the case of persons to whom the Muslim\npersonal law (Shariat) applies.\n\nExplanation I- For the removal of doubts, it is\nhereby declared that any presents made at\nthe time of a marriage to either party to the\nmarriage in the form of cash, ornaments,\nclothes or other articles, shall not be deemed\nto be dowry within the meaning of this\nsection, unless they are made as\nconsideration for the marriage of the said\nparties.\n\nExplanation II- The expression 'valuable\nsecurity' has the same meaning in\nSection 30\n\nof the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).\"\n\n14. The prosecution version primarily rests on three\ndocuments i.e. exhibits 2, 3 and 4 dated 3.1.1990, 20.6.1991\nand 25.10.1990 respectively. A careful reading of these\ndocuments which were letters by the deceased show there was\nin fact no allegations of any demand of dowry made by the\naccused. Exhibit 3 i.e. the letter dated 20.6.1991 is very\nsignificant. Grievance in the said letter was not to any demand\nof dowry. In fact the deceased had clearly written that she was\nforced to marry with the accused against her wish and that\ncreated a lot of problems for her. The underlying essence of\nthe letter is that the deceased was not willing to get married\nand wanted to continue her studies and she was married\nagainst her wish. There is one significant statement in the\nletter, which is to the effect that the deceased did not want to\ngo to her parental home for Gangamma festival as her\nhusband was taking due care of her. In exhibit 4 i.e. letter\ndated letter dated 25.10.1990 she has clearly stated that she\nwas all right and was happy in her in laws place and her in\nlaws were taking good care of her and she on the other hand\nstated that somehow or other she does not want to live in the\nmarital home. In Exhibit 2 i.e. letter dated 3.1.1990 also she\nhad stated that she was happy. In fact she wrote to her father\nthat he should take good care of her mother.\n\n15. Learned counsel for the State referred to a particular\nsentence which speaks as to the effect that Rajamma was\nscolding her. It is to be noted that Rajamma was appellant's\ngrand mother, she is not an accused. It is also not indicated\nin the letter that she was scolding her for any dowry. It is to\nbe noted that the reference to the grand mother being\nunhappy is relatable to the deceased's long absence from the\nmatrimonial home. In fact there is no allegation of any\nharassment due to dowry. What the trial court and the High\nCourt appears to have done is to pick up one line from one\nplace and another from another place and conclude that there\nwas demand of dowry. Reading of the letters in the entirety\nshow that there was, in fact, no mention of any demand for\ndowry. Therefore the conviction in terms of Section 498A and\nSection 304B cannot be maintained. The judgment of the High\nCourt is accordingly set aside and the appellant is acquitted of\nthe charges. Bail bond executed for the release of appellant on\nbail pursuant to the order dated 8.1.2002 shall stand\ndischarged.\n\n16. The appeal is allowed.",

JAIN  JUDGMENT:  J U D G M E N T  CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 11 OF 2002  DR. ARIJIT PASAYAT, J.  1. CHALLENGE IN THIS APPEAL IS TO THE JUDGMENT OF A LEARNED SINGLE JUDGE OF THE ANDHRA PRADESH HIGH COURT UPHOLDING THE CONVICTION OF THE APPELLANT FOR OFFENCES PUNISHABLE UNDER  SECTIONS 304 B AND 498 A OF THE INDIAN PENAL CODE, 1860 (IN SHORT THE ' IPC '). SENTENCE OF SEVEN YEARS WAS IMPOSED ON EACH COUNT. BY THE IMPUGNED JUDGMENT CONVICTION RECORDED IN RESPECT OF CO-ACCUSED LAXMI WAS SET ASIDE AND SHE WAS DIRECTED TO BE ACQUITTED.  2. BACKGROUND FACTS AS PROJECTED BY PROSECUTION IN A NUTSHELL ARE AS FOLLOWS:  PADMA @ PITCHAMMA (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE 'DECEASED') WAS MARRIED TO ACCUSED NO.1-SRINIVASULU ON 21.5.1989. AT THE TIME OF MARRIAGE, PW.1 FATHER OF THE DECEASED GAVE RUPEES 10,000/- IN CASH, FIVE TOLAS OF GOLD, OTHER HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES WORTH RS.3000/- AND RS.1200/- TOWARDS CLOTHES TO ACCUSED NO.1, WHO WAS EMPLOYED AS SUB-STAFF OF KARNATAKA BANK, SECUNDERABAD. ACCUSED NO.2 IS THE MOTHER OF ACCUSED NO.1 AND SHE USED TO VISIT ACCUSED NO.1 IN THE CITY AND DID NOT ALLOW THE DECEASED TO FULFIL CONJUGAL OBLIGATIONS. AT THE INSTIGATION OF ACCUSED NO.2, ACCUSED NO.1 HAD DEMANDED RS.5,000/- MORE FROM THE PARENTS OF THE DECEASED TO PURCHASE A SCOOTER AS ADDITIONAL DOWRY. PW.1, FATHER OF THE DECEASED PAID THE SAID AMOUNT TO ACCUSED NO.1. IN SPITE OF THE SAME, BOTH THE ACCUSED MADE REPEATED DEMANDS FOR ADDITIONAL DOWRY UPON THE DECEASED. ON ONE OCCASION, A SUM OF RS.1,000/- AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A SUM OF RS.2,000/- WAS PAID BY PW.1 TO THE ACCUSED. BUT THE ACCUSED PERSONS DID NOT STOP ILL-  TREATMENT AND HARASSMENT TOWARDS THE DECEASED. AFTER SOME TIME, WHEN THE DECEASED AND HER PARENTS CAME TO KNOW THAT ACCUSED NO.2 WAS THINKING OF A SECOND MARRIAGE OF ACCUSED NO.1, IMMEDIATELY THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF THE ACCUSED BUT ACCUSED NO.1 REFUSED TO TAKE THE DECEASED INTO THE HOUSE. ACCUSED NO.2 ILL-TREATED THE DECEASED AND BOTH THE ACCUSED ASKED THE DECEASED TO GO BACK TO HER PARENTS' HOUSE. ACCUSED NO.1 THREATENED TO IMMOLATE THE DECEASED AND ACCUSED NO.2 THREATENED TO POISON THE DECEASED AND INSISTED THAT SHE CONTINUES TO STAY IN THE HOUSE OF HER PARENTS. THEREFORE, THE DECEASED WAS TAKING SHELTER IN THE HOUSE OF HER PARENTS AND ABOUT 2 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, ON THE ASSURANCE GIVEN BY BOTH THE ACCUSED BEFORE THE ELDERS, THE DECEASED JOINED ACCUSED NOS.1 AND 2 TO FULFIL CONJUGAL OBLIGATIONS. IN SPITE OF THE SAME, THE ACCUSED CONTINUED ILL-TREATMENT AND HARASSMENT FOR MORE DOWRY. BECAUSE OF THE PERSISTENT ILL- TREATMENT AND CRUELTY METED OUT BY THE ACCUSED TOWARDS THE DECEASED, ON 17.9.1992 AT ABOUT 9.30 A.M. THE DECEASED SET HERSELF ABLAZE AND DIED WITH 100% BURN INJURIES IN GANDHI HOSPITAL WHILE UNDERGOING TREATMENT.  FIRST INFORMATION REPORT WAS FILED, INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERTAKEN AND ON COMPLETION THEREOF CHARGE SHEET WAS FILED. ACCUSED PERSONS PLEADED INNOCENCE.  3.
