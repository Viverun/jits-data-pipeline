The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force,\nsocial and beneficial legislation to protect fructify the llegislative\n egislative intent to\nextend benefits to long continuous working of casual labourers\n labourers.\n\n17. The Scheme dated 12.04.1991\n 4.1991 confers temporary status on\ncasual labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant is\nappointee of year 1982 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize\nand ought to have been superannuated before 30.6.2018 accordance with\nlaw as regular employee for no fault of applicant m\n made\n ade to suffer violating\n\nArticle 14\n, 21\n, 31A\n and 3000 of the Constitution of India.\n\n18. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n29.11.1989 pursuant to order dated 19.07.1991 (Annexure A-1) and the\nstatutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years certain advantages to\n 17 OA/050/00372/2021\n\ntemporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the\npay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.\nPara 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to\na Group\n oup 'D' employee after completion of one year of service from date of\nconferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant\nof increment to a government servant on same scale of pay\n pay. The legislative\nintent is clear as noon day in formu\n formulating\n lating the statutory scheme dated\n12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to\nenforce the terms as social legislation to enhance social welfare and\nachieve social justice. The Central Government being an ideal employer\nfulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV\nof the Constitution of India treating temporary status casual labour after\nlong period at par with temporary Group 'D' employee of the Department\ngranting benefits and treating at par with and entitled for such benefits as\nare admissible to the Group 'D' employee on regular basis. The scheme\nfurther provides for Leave Encashment, Maternity Leave as to regular\nGroup 'D' employee, 50% of service under temporary status for retirement\nbenefits after regularization as a regular Group 'D' on absorption. So also\nthe scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation with harmonious\nconstruction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for\nconferment of temporary group 'D' status af\n after\n ter rendering three years\ncontinuous service as temporary status.\n\n19. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 29.11.1989\nand accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\nconstruction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The aapplicant\n pplicant after\nthree years since 29.11.1989 meaning thereby since 29.11.1992 has attained\nstatus of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to\nG.P.F. The applicant was in capacity of temporary employee. The\n he applicant\nhaving continuously worked as temporary status casual labourer since\n29.11.1989 and on 29.11.1992 is holder of post of temporary\nemployee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly by the\nmodel employer state accordance with guaran\n guarantee\n tee enshrined in the \nArticle 14\n\nand \n21\n of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is of the view whereof\nthat it is unfair to continue husband of the applicant such a long in\ntemporary post and without considering for regularizing till retirement.\n\n 18 OA/050/00372/2021\n\n20.

The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory\nterms no recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual\nlabourers available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have\nnot discharged statutory duty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P.\nPart IV of the Constitution of India and applicant husband not regularized\nas for no fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not\ndischarge his duty and not regularized on time for own mistakes\nrespondents\n spondents cannot take advantages and plea not even considered for\nregularization available to them that since no regularization no pension etc.\n\n22. The applicant before retirement submitted representation to\nallow to participate in absorption to regularize services\n services on regular cadre\npost but no response. The respondents have stated in the written statement\nthat applicant could not be promoted as applicant on 05.03.2015 refused\npromotion. The applicant was never at fault for such lack of regularization\nand never refused regularization on the post held for 30 years.\n\n23. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by\napplicant in the O.A that respondents have not regularized services as per\nlaw on time, in spite of written requests and retired on 31.12.2020 without\nbeing regularized. The respondents in written statement not adverted to\nspecific allegation and not specifically denied as per requirement in Rule\n3,4, and 5 of the order VIII \nof Code of Civil Procedure\n. This Tribunal is of\nthe view since respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as\nper the Scheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for\nregularization since 198\n 1981.. Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own\nmistakes and latches to deny retirement benefits as not rregularized\n egularized deceased\n right, right accrued pursuant to\nemployee before retirement. The matter of right\nthe scheme and policy applicable to applicant and he ought to have at least\nconsidered for regularization before date of superannuation. The applicant\nworked sin\n since 1984 till 31.12.2020 almost more than thirty seven (37) years\nin the department\n department.\n\n24. The department of posts issued clarifications some of\nreproduced herein above enumerating advantages of temporary employee.\n\n 19 OA/050/00372/2021\n\nSo also policy dated 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts\nG.I. (5). Benefits of casual labourers on completion of three years service in\ntemporary status reproduced herein above. The vested legal right accrued to\nthe employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not be tak\n taken\n en\naway by respondents. The D\n Department\n epartment of Posts, Ministry of\nTelecommunication & I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated\n12.4.1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of implementation results in failure of\nsocial-economic\n economic justice\n justice.. So also envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part IV of\nConstitution. These policy, scheme circulars are substantive attempts to\nenhance social welfare. The respondents denied to employee accrued rights\nand has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justice.\nHence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no pensionry\nbenefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief\nclaimed.\n\n25. The sub-clause\n clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated\n30.11.1992 quoted herein above is also crystal\n crystal clear that casual labourers of\nthe postal department with effect from date of completion three years of\nservice in newly acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits\nadmissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service\nfor purpose of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary\nemployees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and\nretirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n26. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants\nare regulated bby Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above.\nThe Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and\ndeath gratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same\nprovisions as are applicable to the permanent civilian gov\n government\n ernment servants\nunder the CCS Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021).

So\n 20 OA/050/00372/2021\n\nalso the explanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply\nto (6) cases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to\ncivil service\n servicess and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before\n31st December, 2003, who retired or were retired before having been\nappointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be\npayable to the government servant to the exte\n extent\n nt provided in the Central\nCivil Services (Temporary Service) Rules, 1965. Thus applicant entitled to\nbenefis as admissible to any other public servant and respondents have\nviolated fundamental right enshrined in \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n28. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of\nthree years service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5\ndated 30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to\npension and retirement benefits on his completion of three years service in\ntemporary status followed by regularization.\n\n29. The applicant stood retired on 28.02.2019 as temporary\nemployee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge\nhis duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965\nread with Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of\npension, family pens\n pension\n ion and retirement benefits to temporary employee.\nThe status of employee was at par with regular employee on long\ncontinuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory\nRules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any poli\n policy\n cy\ndecision.\n\n30. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021\nmakes it clear that applicant who stood retired before having been\nappointed in a substantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such type\nof category of temporary employee benefit ooff pension Rules i,.e Pension,\nretirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to\napplicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant under CCS\nPension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:\n\n under:--\n\n (i) On retirement\n irement from service on superannuation or\n invalidation after having rendered continuous\n temporary/quasi permanent service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years\n of continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n 21 OA/050/00372/2021\n\n31. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory\nschemes clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS\nPension Rules 2021 (erstwhile Rules 2017) . This Tribunal considered the\nmatter and in vie\n view of whereof of the affirm view that Government of India,\nDepartment of Posts instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66\n 66--\n\n9/91-SPB\n SPB-II dated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are\nsocial legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously.\n\n harmoniously. The Rules 1965\nand the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status\nin department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly\nacquired temporary status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and\npensionery benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement\nRule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 is failure of social\njustice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is\nsubstantive attempts to enhance social welf\n welfare\n are and state as an ideal\nemployer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in\nPart IV of the Constitution.\n\n32. Thus respondents can not take advantages of their own wrong\nand lapses and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and\napplicant entitled to receive pension as if retired from regular establishment\nand so also held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgement in case\nof \nPrem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC 516\nreproduced herein above.\n\n33.

Reference for consideration before Tribunal in\ncase of Rita D\n Devi\n evi (Supra) was whether applicant - widow of Temporary\n 25 OA/050/00372/2021\n\nStatus at par with Group 'D' - without regularization was entitled for\npension, family pension and benefits this Tribunal vide order dated\n05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as regular Gro\n Group\n up 'D'\n(MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at par with Group\n'D' employee and issue pension, family pension and benefits with arrears.\n\n38. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India &\nOthers\n O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin\nwith issue - whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as\nTemporary Status at par with Group 'D' without regularization is entitled\nfor pension and other retirement benefits?

So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017\nupheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, directing\nrespondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under\nold pension scheme.\n\n39. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that\nas per rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary\nbenefits on regularization with 10 years of qualifying service which\nincludes full service after regularization and 50% service rendered under\ntemporary\n orary status. On working for three years as Temporary Status treated at\npar with Group 'D' employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary\nstatus employee is not regularized having served more than 20 years, it can\nonly be due to failure of respondent\n respondentss department. Temporary Status\nemployee officials otherwise meeting conditions for regularization and\npensionary benefits were thus eligible for pension and retirement benefits.\nSo also this Tribunal considered order passed in identical case OA No.143\n 26 OA/050/00372/2021\n\nof 2018,\n 018, a Temporary Status employee, not regularized and allowed OA for\ngrant of pension. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah\n (Supra) vide order dated\n21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant entitled for pension\nand pensionary benefits taking into accoun\n accountt his Temporary Status period as\nQualifying Service and treating his superannuation on 03.11.2018,\nconsidering 50% pension as Temporary Status as qualifying service and to\nissue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n\n40.
