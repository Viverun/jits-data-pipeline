Pleadings are complete, therefore, looking to the issue involved in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n2 WP-96-2019\nthe case and as per the submission made by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the issue has already been settled, this petition is finally heard.\n\n3. By this petition, the petitioner is claiming family pension due to the\ndeath of her husband, who was working in the respondent department as a\nwork charged & contingency paid employee and after his death, which\noccurred on 25.09.1986, no family pension has been granted to the\npetitioner.\n\n4. As per the facts of the case, the husband of the petitioner was a daily\nwager appointed in the year 1975 and he was paid wages from the Work\nCharged and Contingency Paid establishment; he was regularized in the\nWork Charged Establishment vide order dated 30.11.1983 and thereafter he\n\ndied on 25.09.1986, and as such he had rendered approx. 11 years of services\nin the Work Charged Establishment as a regular employee.\n\n5. As per the reply submitted by the respondents, since the petitioner's\nhusband did not complete the qualifying service as per Rule 4(a) of the\nMadhya Pradesh (Work Charged and Contingency Paid Employees) Pension\nRules, 1979 (for short 'Pension Rules, 1979') he was not eligible for\npension. As per Rule 2(c) of the Pension Rules, 1979, the qualifying service\nof 10 years was not completed by the husband of the petitioner and,\ntherefore, the claim of family pension of the petitioner was rejected.\n\n6. The issue involved in the present case has already been settled. The\nWrit Court in WP No. 13653/2009 - Smt. Ram Bai Rajak vs. State of M.P.\nand others dealing with the same issue has observed as under:-\n\n\"The petitioner is wife of late Shri Anandilal Rajak who was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n3 WP-96-2019\nworking in the respondents department. Late Shri Anandilal Rajak\nwas initially appointed as a daily wages employee on 1.3.1978. He\nwas posted as Chowkidar and subsequently he was regularized on\nthe work charged and contingency paid employee in the\nestablishment on 10.6.1996/18.6.1996 vide Annexures P/2 and P/3\nrespectively. After working for a period about 9 years work\ncharged and in contingency paid establishment the petitioner's\nhusband late Shri Anandilal Rajak died on 20.02.2005. After his\ndeath the petitioner claimed pension and other benefits in\naccordance to the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services (Pension) Rules,\n1976 and the Madhya Pradesh (Worked charged and Contingency\nPaid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979. The claim of the petitioner\nfor grant of family pension and other benefits have been rejected\nonly on the ground that the petitioner's husband has not completed\n10 years regular services in the work charged and contingency\npaid establishment and therefore pension can not be granted vide\nimpugned order Annexure P/8 dated 7.2.2007. The question with\nregard to period of service to be rendered in the work charged and\nContingency Paid Establishment for grant of pension has been\nconsidered by this Court in\nBal Kishan Patel v. State of MP and\nothers\n(WP No.4357/2004) and after taking note the requirement\nof the provisions contained in Madhya Pradesh (Worked charged\nand Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979 and the\nProvisionary Rule 2(c) and Rule 4 A of the said Rules the matter is\nso decided.\n\n\"14. It is apparent that for the purpose of family pension Rule 4-A\nof the Pension Rules of 1979 read with Rule 47 of the Rules of\n1976 makes it clear that if an Incumbent has rendered not less than\n\n7 years continuous service, family of incumbent is entitled for the\nfamily pension. It is not in dispute that deceased Jabmohan Singh\nGond had rendered the contentious service for more than 7 years.\nRule 6 (3) of the Pension Rules of 1979 clearly provides that\nwithout interruption for not less than 6 years such services shall be\ncounted for pension as if such services has rendered on regular\npost, qualifying service has to be given effect to while considering\nthe length of the service, as specified in Rule 2 (c) of the Rules of\n1979 otherwise the purpose of fiction created of Rule (3) stands\ndefeated. Thus the submission raised by the respondents that Rule\n6(3), services cannot to be computed towards qualifying service,\ncannot accepted. The services which has been rendered, as\nqualifying service, under Rule of the Pension Rules of 1979 has to\nbe counted, as rendered on a regular post. Thereafter entitlement\nhas to be determined by the respondents in accordance with law.\"\nIn the case at hand the petitioner's husband was engaged on daily\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n4 WP-96-2019\nwage basis in the Work-charged Establishment of Rani Avantibai\nSagar Project. Thereafter, by order dated 26.06.1996 was bought\non regular Work Charged Establishment in grade 825-900-20-\n1220 as Time Keeper. The late husband of the petitioner while in\nservice expired on 12.2.2001. The petitioner after death of her\nhusband approached the authorities for grant of family pension.\nThe said request was turned down by letter dated 13.09.2006 on\nthe ground that petitioner's husband since has not rendered 10\nyears of service in the Work-charged establishment she was not\nentitled for the family pension. It is this denial which has forced\nthe petitioner to prefer the instant-writ petition.\nA \"Work-charged employee\" is defined under Rule 2 (b) to mean\n'a person employed upon the actual execution, as distinct from\ngeneral supervision of a specified work or upon subordinate\nsupervision of the departmental labour, store, running and repairs\nof electrical equipment and machinery in connection with such\nwork, excluding the daily paid labour and musterroll employee\nemployed on the work.' Whereas, \"permanent employee as\ndefined under clause (c) of Rule 2 of Rules 1979 means \"a\ncontingency paid employee or a work-charged employee has\ncompleted fifteen years of service or more on or after the 1st\nJanuary, 1974: Provided that in respect of a contingency paid\nemployee or a work charged employee who has attained the age of\nsuperannuation on or after the First April 1981, permanent\nemployee means an employee who has completed 10 years of\nservice on or after 1st January, 1974. Rule 4A which was inserted\nvide notification dated 13.9.1982, pub. in M.P. Rajpatra. Pt. IV\n(ga), dated 26.12.1982, page 133; stipulates:\n\n\"4A.

Admittedly the aforesaid\nprovisions have an overriding effect over Rule 4 wherein the\nstipulations have been laid down as to the minimum qualifying\nservice which a person engaged on work-charged establishment\nshould have at his credit, i.e., 10 years, before he is held entitled\nfor grant of pension on his retirement. In other words the bar as\ncreated under Rule 4, in the considered opinion of this Court will\nnot be attracted in case a member of a regular Workchared\nestablishment dies in harness; meaning thereby that even a day's\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n5 WP-96-2019\nservice rendered by a workman brought on regular work-charged\nestablishment in case if he dies thereafter would entitle the family\nof such workman for a family pension as per stipulations\ncontained in Section 4A. The only guiding factor while applying\nRule 4A. of Rules of 1979 would be the conditions stipulated in\nRule 47 of M.P. Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1979 Sub-rule (2)\nof Rule 47 of the Rules, 1976 stipulates; \"(2) Without prejudice to\nthe provisions contained in sub-rule (3), where a Government\nservant dies- (a) While in service provided he had been medically\nexamined and found fit for appointment under the Government.\n\n(b) after retirement from service and was on the date of death in\nreceipt of a pension or compassionate allowance, referred to in\nChapter V on the date of death, the family of the deceased shall be\nentitled to contributory family pension (hereinafter in thisrole\nreferred to as Family Pension) the amount of which shall be\ndetermined as follows:\n\nPay servant of Government servant Amount of month family pension\n\n(i) Below Rs.400 30 per cent of pay subject to a\nminimum of Rs.60 and maximum of\nRs.100.\n\n(ii) Rs.400 and above but not exceeding 15 per cent of pay subject to a\nRs. 1200. minimum of Rs.100 and maximum of\nRs. 160.\n\n(iii) Above Rs. 1200/- 12 per cent of pay subject to a\nminimum of Rs.160 and maximum of\nRs.250.\n\nIn the present case also the claim of the petitioner was rejected\nonly on the ground that the petitioner's husband has not completed\n10 years regular service in work charged and contingency paid\nEstablishment. This could not be done. The petitioner is entitled to\nget pension in the head indicated in the aforesaid table even if he\nhas not completed 10 years service. In this view of the matter\nrejection of petitioner's claim by the impugned order is\nunsustainable Accordingly the order Annexure P/8 dated 7.2.2007\nis quashed, the respondents are directed to fix family pension of\nthe petitioner within a period of 60 days and pay all arrears to the\npetitioner alongwith interest at the rate 6% per annum from the\ndate of entitlement till payment. The petition stands allowed and is\ndisposed of with the aforesaid.\"\n\n7. Similarly, the Division Bench answering a reference made to it on\nthe said issue in WA No. 1522/2019 has considered as under:-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n6 WP-96-2019\n\n\"13. Now coming to family pension. The issue, in our opinion, has\nbeen duly considered and decided in the case of\nSmt. Sampat Bai\nvs State of Madhya Pradesh\n: Writ Petition No.17240/2012 on\n05.02.2013, wherein it is held :\n\n\"Question is whether the respondents are justified in\nrejecting the claim and whether theproposition of law\n\nlaid down in\nMamta Shukla (supra) and the provisions\nof M.P. (Work Charged and Contingency Paid\nEmployees) Pension Rules, 1979 and M. P. Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules 1976, supports the rejection\norder. And whether rendering 10 years of service in a\nwork charged establishment will also be condition\nprecedent for granting of family pension, could be\nascertained after examining the relevant provision of\n1979 Rules and that of 76 Rules. Rule 4 A of the Rules\nof 1979 and Rule 6 thereof respectively provide for: \"4\nA. Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 4 the\nfamily of a permanent employee, who dies while in\nservice or after retirement on pension on or after the 1st\nApril 1981 shall be entitled to family pension at the rate\nof 30% of his/her pay drawn at the time of\ndeath/retirement subject to minimum, of Rs.40/- per\nmonth and maximum of Rs. 100/- per month subject to\nother conditions of Rule 47 of Madhya Pradesh Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules, 1976 except sub-rule (3) of\nthe said Rules. 6.

When the\naforesaid two Rules are read together, it is clear as\ncrystal that the provisions which govern the family\npension has a different field of operation than the\nprovisions regarding pension to an employee who\nretires from the workcharged establishment and are\ngoverned by Rule 6 of Rules of 1979. By virtue of Rule\n4 A the provisions as contained under Rule 47 of the\nM.P. Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1976 are attracted.\nThe said Rule provides for 47. Contributory Family\nPension - (1) The provisions of this rule shall apply:-\n\n(a) to a Government servant entering service in a\npensionable establishment or on after 1st April 1966,\nand (b) to a Government servant who was in service on\n31st March, 1966 and came to be governed by the\nprovisions of the Family Pension Scheme for State\nGovernment Employees, 1966 contained in\nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh Finance Department\nmemo No.1963/C.R903-IV-R.

As to the law laid\ndown by Full Bench in Mamta Shukla (supra) the issue\nbefore the Full Bench was- \"(i) Whether the decision of\nthe Division Bench in W.A. No. 725/2007,\nSmt.\nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. and others\nis not a\ngood law in view of the decision of the earlier Division\nBench of this Court vide order dated 18- 7-2005, passed\nin W.P.

(ii) Whether an employee is\neligible for the benefit of family pension in accordance\nwith the provisions of Madhya Pradesh (Work Charged\nand Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979\nafter completing qualifying service in accordance with\nthe provisions of Recruitment Rules framed by the\nconcerned Department for work charged and\ncontingency paid employees or in accordance with the\ndefinition of Rule 2 of Madhya Pradesh (Work Charged\nand Contingency Paid Employees) Pension Rules, 1979\nin regard to \"contingency paid employee\", \"work-\ncharged employee\" and permanent employee\" ?

We further hold that an\nemployee, who was not appointed in accordance with\nthe provisions of Recruitment Rules framed by the\nconcerned department, i.e., the Recruitment Rules of\n1977, would not be eligible to count his past service as\nqualifying service for the purpose of grant of pension in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n9 WP-96-2019\naccordance with the Pension Rules of 1979 and we\nanswer the substantial questions of law Nos. 2 and 3\naccordingly. 25.\n\nIn regard to substantial question of law\nNo. 1 Earlier Division Bench of this Court in W.P. No.\n1273/2000,\nState of M.P. vs. Ramsingh and another\n, as\nheld that a daily wager employee would not fall within\nthe definition of work charged and contingency paid\nemployee, hence his case would not be covered by\nMadhya Pradesh Work charged and Contingency Paid\nEmployees Pension Rules, 1979, has not been noticed\nby the subsequent Division Bench of this Court in\n\nRahisha Begum vs. State of M.P. And\nother, 2010(4)\nMPLJ 332. However, in the subsequent case, the\nDivision Bench has held that if an employee comes\nwithin the definition of work charged and contingency\npaid employee as defined the Pension Rules of 1979,\nthen he is eligible to count his past service for the\npurpose of qualifying service in accordance with the\nRules of 1979. In our opinion, there is no conflict\nbetween the Division Bench judgments, because the\nfindings of the Division Benches are based on different\nfactual aspects. Accordingly, we answer the substantial\nquestion of law No. 1 that there is no conflict of opinion\nbetween the two Division Bench judgments.\n\nHence, the\ndecision of the Division Bench in the case of\nRahisha\nBegum vs. State of M.P. and others\n, 2010(4) MPLJ 332,\nis not per incuriam. We answer substantial question of\nlaw No. 1 accordingly.\"\n\nApparent, it is from the above pronouncement that, the\nissue as to grant of family pension to a widow of an\nemployee of work charged who are apparently covered\nby Rule 4A of Rules of 1979 was not the term of\nreference and nor was the same dwelt upon by the Full\nBench. In view of above, the respondents are not\njustified in denying the family pension to the petitioner\nonly on the ground that the petitioner's husband did not\ncomplete 10 years of service in Regular Work Charged\nEstablishment. In view whereof, the impugned order\ndated 07.05.2012 is quashed. The respondents are\ndirected to grant family pension to the petitioner from\nthe date of entitlement. Petitioner shall also be entitled\nfor the interest @ 7.5% on the difference till its final\npayment.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n10 WP-96-2019\n\n8. Thus, in view of the aforesaid settled legal position, it is clear that\nthe petitioner's claim for grant of family pension cannot be rejected by the\nrespondents on the ground that her husband had not completed 10 years of\nqualifying service in the Work Charged Establishment.\n\n9. Although the respondents have also raised a ground of delay saying\nthat the husband of the petitioner died in the year 1986, but no claim of\nfamily pension was raised by the petitioner and therefore this petition\ndeserves to be dismissed on the ground of delay and latches.\n\nThe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nState of Orissa v. Mamata\nMohanty\n, (2011) 3 SCC 436 has held as under:-\n\n\"54. This Court has consistently rejected the contention that a\npetition should be considered ignoring the delay and laches in case\nthe petitioner approaches the Court after coming to know of the\nrelief granted by the Court in a similar case as the same cannot\nfurnish a proper explanation for delay and laches. A litigant cannot\nwake up from deep slumber and claim impetus from the judgment\nin cases where some diligent person had approached the Court\nwithin a reasonable time. (See\nRup Diamonds v. Union of\nIndia\n[(1989) 2 SCC 356 :\nAIR 1989 SC 674], State of\nKarnataka v. S.M. Kotrayya\n[(1996) 6 SCC 267 : 1996 SCC\n(L&S) 1488] and Jagdish Lal v.

Thangappan\nreported in (2006) 4 SCC 322 has held as follows :\n\n6. Delay or laches is one of the factors which is to be borne in\nmind by the High Court when they exercise their discretionary\npowers under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. In an appropriate\ncase the High Court may refuse to invoke its extraordinary powers\nif there is such negligence or omission on the part of the applicant\nto assert his right as taken in conjunction with the lapse of time\nand other circumstances, causes prejudice to the opposite party.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n11 WP-96-2019\nEven where fundamental right is involved the matter is still within\nthe discretion of the Court as pointed out in\nDurga Prashad v.\nChief Controller of Imports and Exports\n(1969) 1 SCC 185. Of\ncourse, the discretion has to be exercised judicially and\nreasonably.\n\n7. What was stated in this regard by Sir Barnes Peacock in\nLindsay Petroleum Co. v. Prosper Armstrong Hurd (1874) 5 PC\n221 (PC at p. 239) was approved by this Court in\nMoon Mills Ltd.\nv. M.R. Meher\n[\nAIR 1967 SC 1450] and Maharashtra SRTC v.\nShri Balwant Regular Motor Service\n[AIR 1969 SC 329]. Sir\nBarnes had stated:\n\n\"Now, the doctrine of laches in courts of equity is not an arbitrary\nor a technical doctrine. Where it would be practically unjust to\ngive a remedy either because the party has, by his conduct done\nthat which might fairly be regarded as equivalent to a waiver of it,\nor where by his conduct and neglect he has though perhaps not\nwaiving that remedy, yet put the other party in a situation in which\nit would not be reasonable to place him if the remedy were\nafterwards to be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time\nand delay are most material. But in every case, if an argument\nagainst relief, which otherwise would be just, is founded upon\nmere delay, that delay of course not amounting to a bar by any\nstatute of limitation, the validity of that defence must be tried\nupon principles substantially equitable. Two circumstances always\nimportant in such cases are, the length of the delay and the nature\nof the acts done during the interval which might affect either party\nand cause a balance of justice or injustice in taking the one course\nor the other, so far as it relates to the remedy.\n\n9.In the case of\nGhulam Rasool Lone vs State of J&K\nreported in\n(2009) 15 SCC 321 , it is held as follows:\n\n\"19. It is beyond any cavil of doubt that the remedy under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India is a discretionary one. For\nsufficient or cogent reasons a court may in a given case refuse to\nexercise its jurisdiction; delay and laches being one of them. While\nconsidering the question of delay and laches on the part of the\npetitioner, the court must also consider the effect thereof.\"\n\nIn view of aforesaid, in the present case, it is found by this Court that\nthe petitioner has filed this petition at the age of 65 years, and the husband of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nSigned by: NIDHI DAVE\n\nSigning time: 11-12-\n\n2025 10:18:14\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025:MPHC-JBP:63513\n\n12 WP-96-2019\nthe petitioner had expired in the year 1986. In Clause 4 of the petition, it is\nstated that in the year 2018 notice was sent, which shows that the petitioner\nhas kept silence for so many years after the death of her husband and got up\nfrom the deep slumber only in the year 2018.
