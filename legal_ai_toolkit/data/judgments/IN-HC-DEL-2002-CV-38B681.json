The petitioner is Union of India. Respondent\nNo.2 Shri Surender Prasad (hereinafter to be referred\nas \"workman\") was employed in the departmental canteen\nof Ministry of Works and Housing (hereinafter referred\nto as \"the Management\") as Assistant Manager. His\nservices were terminated by orders dated 26.4.1980\nwhich was an order of termination simpliciter. The\nworkman feeling aggrieved by this order of termination\nraised Industrial Disputes by invoking the machinery of\nConciliation under the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\n\n(hereinafter referred to as `the Act'). The Management\nwas summoned. Conciliation proceedings started but:\n\nCWP.No.248/85\n\nended in failure. Thereafter, on\nconsideration of the failure report submitted by\nConciliation Officer, Central Government being the\nappropriate Government made Reference Order dated\n21.5.1981 referring the dispute for adjudication of the\nCentral Government Industrial Tribunal with the\nfollowing terms of reference:\n\n\"Whether the action of the Chairman,\nDepartmental Canteen, Ministry of Works\nand Housing, Nirman Bhawan, New Delhi in\nterminating the services of Shri Surinder\nPershad, Assistant Manager, with effect\nfrom 26.4.1980 is legal and justified?\nIf not, to what relief the workman is\nentitled?\"\n\n2. It was registered as I.D.No.68/81.\n\nThe case of the workman before the Tribunal\nwas that he was regular, permanent employee. The\naction of termination was preceded by issuance of\ncharge-sheet but no enquiry was held and instead\ntermination order dated 26.4.1980 was passed. It was\nalso stated that it was a mala fide action as workman\nhad taken part in union activities as he was Organising\nSecretary of the All India Canteen Mazdoor Sabha\n(Registered).\n\n3. The Management contested the claim by filing\nwritten statement raising number of preliminary\nobjections which included:\n\n(1) the workman was a holder of civil post\nand, therefore, he could not raise industrial dispute,\n\n(2) the Management i.e. Departmental Canteen\nwas not an `industry' within the meaning of\nSection\n2(j)\nof the Act,\n\n(3) He was a purely temporary employee and his\nservices were validly terminated under CCS (Temporary\nServices) Rules,1965,\n\n(4) Shri Surender Prasad was not `workman'\nunder\nSection 2(s)\nof the Act as he was Assistant\nManager performing managerial duties.\n\n4. On merits, it was sought to be pointed out\nthat the termination was on account of generally\nunsatisfactory performance of duties by the workman and\non account of mis-behavior with the Hony.Joint\nSecretary of the Departmental Canteen and that he also\ninstigated certain persons to join other persons in\nphysically assaulting him on 17.3.1980 and raising\nslogans and using abusive language against the Chairman\nof the Departmental Canteen but the action taken\nagainst him was not by way of disciplinary action but\nsimply termination of service of a temporary employee\nunder the Rules.\n\nOn the basis of the pleadings, Industrial\nTribunal framed the following issues:\n\n1. As per terms of reference.\n\n2. Whether the claimant is not a workman?~\nThe parties led their evidence and argued the\ncase where after the Industrial Tribunal rendered\nimpugned Award dated 10.10.1984.\n\nRelying upon the judgment of the Constitution\nBench of the Supreme Court in the case of\nBangalore\nWater Supply and Sewerage Board Vs. A.Rajappa the Tribunal\nheld that the\nManagement was `Industry' within the meaning of\nSection\n2(j)\nof the Act as the triple test\nlaid down in\n\nthe\nsaid judgment\nstood satisfied. The contention of the\nManagement to the effect that the canteen was\ndischarging sovereign function was brushed aside.\nThereafter the learned Tribunal examined the duties of\nthe claimant Shri Surender Prasad on the basis of which\nit recorded the finding to the effect that he was a\n`workman' covered by the definition under\nSection 2(s)\n\nof the Act. The relevant discussion to this effect is\nin para-11 of the Award which reads as under:\n\n\"11. The claimant Surinder Pershad, in his\naffidavit in para 6, clearly mentioned\nthat his duties were to keep accounts and\nto deal with other affairs of the canteen\nand, when some person was not on duty, he\nwas performing duty of such a person in\nhis absence and was also assisting the\nstaff at the time of rush to meet with\nthe situation. He is not shown by the\nManagement to have any managerial\nfunctions like allocation of work to\nother employees in the canteen and taking\ndisciplinary action against them. At the\nmost, he could be said to have\nsupervisory functions, but because\nemoluments were only Rs.341/-p.m. he\nremain within the definitions of\n`workman' given in\nSection 2(s)\nof the\nI.D. Act,1947\".\n\n5. The Tribunal also did not find favor with the\ncontention of the Management that simply because the\nworkman was holder of civil post and governed by CCS\n(Temporary Services) Rules,1965, the provisions of the\nAct would not apply. Thereafter the Tribunal after\ndiscussing the relevant Rules and Notifications\n(reference to which would be made at the appropriate\nstage) came to the conclusion that on promotion of the\nworkman as Assistant Manager w.e.f.1.2.1979 on\nprobation for three months extendable by another three\nmonths, the workman would be deemed to have been\nconfirmed as Assistant Manager in regular service as\nper the Rules after the expiry of six months. The\nTribunal also held that the foundation of the order\nunmistakably was misconduct of the employee, and not\nmerely a motive for his discharge and therefore in any\ncase the termination of his service was invalid.\nResultantly the Tribunal granted the workman relief of\nreinstatement with full back wages and continuation of\nservice.\n\n6. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nreiterated same very submissions which were raised\nbefore the learned Tribunal. In the first place, it\nwas the argument of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that Departmental Canteen run by the\nMinistry of Works and Housing was held to be outside\nthe term of Industry vide notification dated 12.1.1982\nand therefore, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to pass\nimpugned award. In any case it was argued that the\nworkman was governed by CCS(Temporary Services)Rules\nand, therefore, he could not invoke the provisions of\nthe Act. Further since he was not a workman within the\nmeaning of\nSection 2(s)\nof the Act, he could not raise\nthe Industrial Dispute and that since he was a\ntemporary employee his services could be terminated\nunder Rule-5 of the Temporary Service Rules by way of\ntermination simplicitor and the termination was not\nstigmatic.\n\n7. Insofar as the issue of Industry is concerned,\nheavy reliance is placed upon Notification dated\n12.1.1982 and particularly the following portion\nthereof was pressed into service:\n\n\".....who have since been treated as\nholders of civil posts under\nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution vide GSR 54 dated\n17.01.1981, and it has been decided in\nconsultation with the Ministry of Law\nthat the canteens run departmentally in\nCentral Government Offices could be\nregarded as excluded from the definition\nof `industry' under\nSection 2(i)\nof the\nIndustrial Disputes Act. As such the\nemployees of such canteens do not come\nunder the purview of\nIndustrial Disputes\nAct\n-1947. Ministry of Agriculture etc.\nmay kindly see and circulate to offices\nunder their administrative control\".\n\n8. However, this would be of no consequence as\nwhether the Management is Industry or not is to be\ndetermined on the basis of interpretation of\nSection\n2(j)\nof the Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court\nwhich is law under\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n9. The seven Judge judgment of the Supreme Court\nin the case of\nBangalore Water Supply and Sewerage\nBoard Vs. A.Rajappa\n(supra) still holds the field.\nThe Tribunal has rightly held that triple test\nlaid\ndown in\n\nthe said judgment\napplies to this Departmental\nCanteen also. Merely because the Canteen employees run\ndepartmentally in Central Government Offices are\ntreated as holders of civil posts, Departmental\nCanteens could not be excluded from the definition of\nIndustry.\n\nThe aforesaid Notification dated 12.1.1982\nis thus contrary to the dicta\nlaid down in\n\nBangalore\nWater Supply\ncase (supra) and, therefore, is not\nbinding on the Courts.\n\n10. The learned counsel for the petitioner also\nplaced reliance in the case of Bombay Telephone Canteen\nEmployees Association, Prabhadevi Exchange Versus Union\nof India & Others wherein Bombay\nTelephone Canteen Employees Association was held to be\nnot Industry within the meaning of\nSection 2(g)\nof the\nAct. However\n,\nthe said judgment\nhas been specifically\noverruled by the Supreme Court in the case of\nG.M.Telephone Vs. A. Srinivas Rao 1998 SCC (L&S) 6\nwherein the Supreme Court held that decision in\naforesaid case was in direct conflict with\nBangalore\nWater Supply\ncase (supra).\n\n11. The argument of the learned counsel to the\neffect that predominant activities of the petitioner\nare sovereign and the canteen is only highly micro part\nof the said activity is also devoid of any merit and is\nhighly misconceived.\nIn\nBangalore Water Supply\ncase\n(supra) the Supreme Court has laid down the test in the\nfollowing words:\n\n\"140. `Industry', as defined in\nSection\n2(j)\nand explained in Banerji (supra),\nhas a wide import.\n\n(a) Where (i) systematic activity, (ii)\norganized by co-operation between\nemployer and employee (the direct and\nsubstantial element is chimerical) (iii)\nfor the production and/or distribution of\ngoods and services calculated to satisfy\nhuman wants and wishes (not spiritual or\nreligious but inclusive of material\nthings or services gearer to celestial\nbliss e.g. making, on a large scale\nprasad or food), prima facie, there is an\n`industry' in that enterprise.\n\n(b) Absence of profit motive or gainful\nobjective is irrelevant, be the venture\nin the public, joint, private or other\nsector.\n\n(c) The true focus is functional and the\ndecisive test is the nature of the\nactivity with special emphasis on the\nemployer-employee relations.\n\n(d) If the organisation is a trade or\nbusiness it does not cease to be one\nbecause of philanthropy animating the\nundertaking\".\n\n12. In any case this argument of the petitioner is\nbased on Bombay Telephone Canteen Employees Association\n(supra) which has been specifically overruled.\n\n13. Keeping in view the aforesaid position in law,\nthe irresistible conclusion is that the Management\nwould be `Industry' within the meaning of\nSection 2(j)\n\nof the Act.\n\n14. The argument of the Management to the effect\nthat Shri Surender Prasad was not a workman is equally\nmisconceived. The main thrust of the argument is that\nhe was discharging managerial duties and, therefore, a\nperson who is discharging managerial duties would not\nbe treated as workman. In support reliance is placed\nupon the following judgments:\n\nThe Management of M/s. Statesman Ltd.\n\nNew Delhi Vs. Lt. Governor, Delhi and others\n1975 Lab IC 543.\n\n\"....\nSection 2(s)\nexpressly excludes\nmanagerial or administrative officers and\nalso would not apply to literary or\nintellectual workers.\"\n\n2.\nP.A.S. Press, Madras Vs. Presiding\nOfficer, Labour\nCourt Madras and another .\n\n\"....whether an employee is a workman or\ncomes within the exception (iii) or (iv)\nof\nSection 2(s)\ndepends not on his\ndesignation but on the exact nature of\nduties and functions for which he is paid\nremuneration.\"\n\n3. Andhra Scientific Co.Ltd.\nMasulipatam by\nthe General Manager Vs. A Seshagiri Rao\nrepresented by\nAndhra Scientific Co. Employees' Union, Masulipatam\nand another .\n\n\"....Decisive test is nature of work done\nby person and not his designation.\"\n\n4.\nC.Narayana Reddy Vs. Management of\nAjantha Theatre and another\n1994 Lab I.C. 2634\n(Karnataka).\n\n\"...If a person is appointed mainly in\nmanagerial or supervisory capacity he\ncannot be said to be workman and salary\ndrawn by him is of no consequence for\npurpose of determining whether he is a\nworkman or not\".\n\n5. Ramendra Narayan Deb. Vs. 8th Industrial\nTribunal, West Bengal and others 1975 Lab IC 94 (Cal).\n\n\"....The determining factor in deciding\nwhether a person is a workman or a\nsupervisor is the principal or main work\nhe is required to do in his employment.\nThe principal nature of his work can be\ndetermined from the letter of\nappointment, the nature of his duties and\nother attending circumstances\".\n\n6. 1994 Lab IC (NOC) 216 Kerala.\n\n\"....Employee performing multifarious\nduties - Dominant work of employee was\nsupervisory in character - He is not a\nworkman\".\n\nHowever, whether a person is discharging\nmanagerial or supervisory duties would depend upon the\nnature of duties being performed and not the\nnomenclature attached to a post. Therefore, the\nsubmission of the petitioner that he is described as\nAssistant Manager or that he is No.2 from the top in\nhierarchy of appointed employees as would be clear from\nthe Office Order No.71/80 dated 27.2.1980 would be of\nno consequence. The petitioner has not at all cited\nanything on record to prove that he was discharging\nmanagerial or supervisory duties. On the other hand as\nis clear from para-11 of the Award quoted above, Shri\nSurender Prasad had categorically stated his duties,\nnamely, to keep accounts to to deal with other affairs\nof the canteen when some person was not on duty. With\nregard to alleged duties the only support which the\nlearned counsel for the Management tried to get was an\naffidavit of Shri Surender Prasad filed before the\nlearned Tribunal wherein in para-3 he objected to the\nalleged going out of office of one employee Shri\nChanderkanta without taking his permission. This\nsolitary instance even if admitted would at the most\nmake his duties as supervisory. However, since he was\ndrawing the salary of Rs.341/-P.M. which is less than\nRs.1650/-PM even if he was discharging supervisory\nfunction he would still be a workman under\nSection 2(s)\n\nof the Act. All the judgments cited by the petitioner,\ntherefore, are not applicable to the facts and\ncircumstances of the present case as the Management is\nnot able to prove on record that Shri Surender Prasad\nwas discharging managerial duties.\n\nThere was much debate as to whether the\nworkman stood confirmed and was, therefore, to be\ntreated as regular employee or he was still a temporary\nemployee governed by CCS (Temporary Service)\nRules,1965. His services are terminated under CCS\n(Temporary Service) Rules and without holding enquiry.\nTherefore, if he was to be treated as regular employee,\ntermination would be illegal on this score itself.\n\nAs pointed out above the Tribunal has held\nthat he was deemed to have become regular employee and\nfor this purpose the Tribunal had relied upon Open\nDepartmental Canteen Employees (Recruitment and\nConditions of Service) Rules,1980 which had been\nenacted under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India\nand although promulgated on 23.12.1980 were made\neffective retrospectively i.e. from 1.10.1979. On the\nother hand, the case of the petitioner was that when\nthe services of the workman were terminated on\n26.4.1980 these Rules had been promulgated for which\nnotification was issued only on 23.12.1980 and,\ntherefore, these Rules did not apply in the case of the\nworkman. The argument of the workman was that these\nRules came into force retrospectively i.e. w.e.f.\n1.10.1979 and, therefore, would be applicable in his\ncase when his services were terminated on 26.4.1980.\n\nTo my mind, learned Tribunal has rightly\ndecided the issue. When it is competent for the\nPresident to promulgate the rules with retrospect\neffect, which was done in the present case, there is no\nreason to deny that Rules did not come into effect\nw.e.f. 1.10.79 even when the Notification was issued\non 23.12.1980. It may be mentioned that vide\nNotification dated 11.12.1979 all posts in the Canteen\nand Tiffins run departmentally by the Government of\nIndia were treated as civil posts w.e.f. 1.10.1979.\nEven while issuing this Notification, it was clearly\nstipulated therein:\n\n\"necessary rules governing their\nconditions of service will be framed\nunder proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution to have retrospect effect\nfrom the first day of 1979\"\n\n15. Thus the canteen employees were treated as\nholders of civil posts w.e.f. 1.10.1979 by\nNotification dated 11.12.1979 and for that reason even\nthe Notification dated 23.12.1980 framing the rules was\ngiven effect from 1.10.1979. The legal effect thereof\nwould be that the Rules were enforced as on 1.10.1979\nand as the workman was in service on that date, these\nRules would squarely be applicable in this case. Thus\nif as per these Rules the petitioner had successfully\ncompleted the probation period and even the maximum\nprobation period in September,1979, he would be deemed\nas regular employee and, therefore, the petitioner\ncould not resort to Temporary Service Rules. The\ntermination of a regular employee without holding an\nenquiry would be illegal on this count as well. The\nTribunal has also held that even if the workman was\ngoverned by CCS (Temporary Service) Rules, termination\nis stigmatic and therefore illegal. However, as it is\nheld that the workman had become a permanent employee\nand, therefore, provisions of CCS (Temporary Service)\nRules could not be resorted to, it is not necessary to\ngo into this question.\n\n16. The net effect of the aforesaid discussion is\nthat the Tribunal was right in holding that termination\nof the workman was contrary to law and, therefore,\nillegal.\n\n17. In the present case when the writ petition was\nfiled, while issuing Rule on 25.1.1985 this Court had\nstayed the reinstatement subject to full back wages of\nthe workman concerned being deposited by the petitioner\nin this Court. The workman was directed to withdraw\n50% of the deposit on giving security for restitution\nin case the rule is made absolute. Yet by another\norder dated 25.3.1985, having regard to the provisions\nof\nSection 17B\nof the I.D.Act, further direction was\nissued to the Management to pay the workman full wages\nlast drawn by him inclusive of any maintenance\nallowance admissible to him under the rule during the\npendency of proceedings. By another order dated\n20.1.1986 the workman was allowed to withdraw 50% of\nthe back wages deposited by the Management by\ndispensing with the condition of furnishing of the\nsecurity. Remaining 50% amount has been kept in a\nfixed deposit.\n\n18. After the order dated 25.3.1985 the Management\nstarted paying full wages at the rate of Rs.1167/-PM\nwhich was paid up to July,1987 where after the workman\nwas paid at the rate of Rs.346/-PM. In these\ncircumstances the workman filed CM.962/88 and by order\ndated December 1,1988 on the stay application this\nCourt clarified that full wages which were paid would\ninclude revision of wages i.e. the wages to which the\nworkman would have been entitled had he been taken back\nin service and the direction was given to this effect\nto pay him Rs.1167/-PM in stead of Rs.346/-PM.\nThereafter, orders were made from time to time for\npayment of the wages to the workman as per revised pay\nscale. It is thus clear from these orders that the\nworkman has got the salary for the intervening period\nat the rate at which he would have got but for his\ntermination. He has also withdrawn 50% of the back\nwages which were awarded by the Tribunal. Remaining\n50% along with interest are lying in the Court. The\nworkman would be entitled to withdraw that amount as\nwell. The effect of that order would be that the\nworkman has got the salary of the entire period from\nthe date of his termination up to this date.\n\n19. As noted above, the petitioner had levelled\nserious allegations of misconduct against the workman\nfor which he was placed under suspension and even the\ncharge-sheet was issued. However, without holding the\nenquiry, provisions of CCS (Temporary Service) Rules\nwere resorted to. Therefore, it would be open to the\npetitioner to consider as to whether the petitioner\nwants to proceed with the enquiry. Such a decision\nshould be taken by the Competent Authority within a\nperiod of three months from the date of the\ncommunication of this judgment.\n\n20. Subject to the aforesaid observations, this\nwrit petition stands dismissed.",
