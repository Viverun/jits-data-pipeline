JUSTICE ADITYA KUMAR TRIVEDI\nCAV ORDER\nDate: 12-01-2017\n\n1. Sole petitioner Upendra Rai has challenged the order dated\n\n16.11.2012\npassed by the SDJM, Vaishali at Hajipur in Complaint Case\n\nNo.C1-1607 of 2012, \"Meena Devi vs. Upendra Rai & Ors.\" whereby and\n\nwhereunder petitioner along with others has been summoned to face trial\n\nfor an offence punishable under\nSection 498A\nIPC, 4 of\nDowry Prohibition\n\nAct\n.\n\n2. Because of the fact that basically it relates with marital\n\ndiscord on account thereof, this Court had given so many adjournments\n\neven after referring the matter to High Court Mediation and Conciliation\n\nCentre, unfortunately, by the action of the parties the desirability in getting\n\nrevival of conjugal life could not restored. Lastly, the matter has been\n\nheard on merit.\n\n3. The O.P. No.2, Meena Devi filed complaint petition\n\nnarrating the event that she was married with Upendra Rai about six years\n\nago. At the time of marriage her parents had given cash appertaining to\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 2\n\nRs.51,000/-, ornaments, furniture, household articles appertaining to\n\nrupees one lac. After marriage, she came to her Sasural where she\n\nstayed. One month after the stay, the accused persons began to harass\n\nher on the score that at the time of marriage her parents had not fulfilled\n\ntheir desire and so, they coerce to bring one T.V., motorcycle and cash\n\nappertaining to rupees one lac to do business. As, complainant protested,\n\nshe was being regularly assaulted. Sometimes foods were not supplied.\n\nShe conveyed her miseries to her parents whereupon her father rushed,\n\nconvened panchayati wherein the accused persons undertook to keep the\n\ncomplainant in congenial, peaceful, pleasant atmosphere but at each\n\noccasion, after due interval, she was treated in same manner and lastly,\n\nafter snatching all her belongings, she was kicked out from her Sasural.\n\nAfter her arrival at Naihar, she had disclosed her woe to her parents,\n\nbrother who took her to police station but as the police declined to register\n\na case instructing to file complaint case, on account thereof, the same has\n\nbeen filed.\n\n4. The aforesaid complaint was sent to the court of SDJM\n\nunder Section 192 of the Cr.P.C. by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nVaishali at Hajipur for holding an inquiry under Section 202 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nand after concluding the same, the learned lower court by the order\n\nimpugned summoned the petitioner and others on account thereof,\n\nchallenged the same under instant petition.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner challenge the order\n\nimpugned on sole ground of lack of jurisdiction. To substantiate such plea,\n\nit has been submitted that from narration of the complaint petition as well\n\nas statement of the witnesses, it is evident that whatever allegation has\n\nbeen attributed by the complainant which she faced during her stay at her\n\nSasural which lies within the original jurisdiction of Saran district and so,\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 3\n\nthe court of Saran at Chapra is only competent enough to entertain and\n\nproceed with the trial. Therefore, the Vaishali court lacks jurisdiction and\n\non account thereof, the order impugned is fit to be set aside. Furthermore,\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon\nY. Abraham Ajith and\n\nothers v. Inspector of Police, Chennai and another\nreported in AIR\n\n2004 SC 4286, Ramesh Kumar Srivastava & Anr. v. State of Bihar &\n\nAnr. reported in 2009(2) East.\nCr.C 419, Mumtaz Bano Arzoo & Ors. v.\n\nState of Bihar & Anr. reported in 2010(1) East. Cr.C 243, Santokh\n\nSingh v. State of Jharkhand & Anr. reported in 2010(1) East. Cr.C 154,\n\nAmarendu Jyoti & Ors. v. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors. reported in\n\n2015(1) East. Cr.C 231 (SC), Avinash Kumar Singh @ Avinash Kumar\n\n& Ors. v. The State of Bihar & Anr. reported in 2015(4) East.\nCr.C 738\n\n(Pat), Manoj Yadav @ Manoj Kumar Yadav & Ors. with\nRaj Kumar\n\nYadav @ Raj Kumar-1 & Ors. v. The State of Jharkhand & Anr\n.\n\nreported in 2015(4) East. Cr.C 741 (Jhr), and submitted that consistent\n\nview happens to be that the offence of 498A\nIPC\nis not a continuing\n\noffence therefore, the prosecution should be launched at the place within\n\nwhich area the offence has been alleged. As, the offence has been\n\nalleged to have taken place at the matrimonial place lying within original\n\njurisdiction of Saran at Chapra, on account thereof, prosecution having\n\nlaunched at Vaishali at Hajipur appears to be misconceived as well as\n\nnon-maintainable, consequent thereupon the order impugned is fit to be\n\nset aside.\n\n6. Learned Additional Public Prosecutor along with learned\n\ncounsel for the O.P. No.2 have submitted that no infirmity is found in the\n\norder impugned, on account thereof did not require any sort of inference.\n\nFurthermore, it has been submitted that the learned lower court after due\n\ninquiry, found a prima facie case whereupon took cognizance of an\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 4\n\noffence and summoned the petitioner along with others and so, for the\n\npresent, it should not be nullified on the factum of lack of jurisdiction.\n\nFurthermore, also submitted that the offence being continuing one, hence\n\ncourt of Vaishali at Hajipur has got jurisdiction to entertain the complaint\n\nand in likewise manner has jurisdiction to conduct trial.\n\n7. Before coming to the jurisdictional avenue trial having been\n\nconducted at different place by a competent court would not nullify the\n\nfinding as is evident from the spirit of\nSection 462\nof the Cr.P.C. and for\n\nbetter appreciation, the same is quoted below:\n\n\"462. Proceedings in wrong place.- No finding,\nsentence or order of any Criminal Court shall be set\naside merely on the ground that the inquiry, trial or\nother proceedings in the course of which it was\narrived at or passed, took place in a wrong sessions\ndivision, district, sub-division or other local area,\nunless it appears that such error has in fact\noccasioned a failure of justice.\"\n\n8. Apart from this in\nKrishna Kumar Variar v. Share Shoppe\n\nreported in 2010 Cr.L.J. 3848, it has been held:\n\n\"5. In our opinion, in such cases where the accused\nor any other person raises an objection that the Trial\nCourt has no jurisdiction in the matter, the said\nperson should file an application before the Trial\nCourt making this averment and giving the relevant\nfacts. Whether a Court has jurisdiction to try/entertain\na case will, at least in part, depend upon the facts of\nthe case. Hence, instead of rushing to the higher‟\nCourt against the summoning order, the concerned\nperson should approach the Trial Court with a\nsuitable application for this purpose and the Trial\nCourt should after hearing both the sides and\nrecording evidence, if necessary, decide the question\nof jurisdiction before proceeding further with the\ncase.\"\n\n9. Now coming to desirability of the prosecution under\nSection\n\n498A\nof the IPC,\nSection 198A\nof the Cr.P.C. deals with the same and\n\nprescribes a non-ostensible clause in following:\n\n\"198A. Prosecution of offences under\nsection\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code\nNo Court shall take cognizance of an offence\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 5\n\npunishable under\nsection 498A\nof the Indian Penal\nCode (45 of 1860) except upon a police report of facts\nwhich constitute such offence or upon a complaint\nmade by the person aggrieved by the offence or by\nher father, mother, brother, sister or by her father's or\nmother's brother or sister or, with the leave of the\nCourt, by any other person related to her by blood,\nmarriage or adoption.\"\n\n10.\nSection 14\nof the Cr.P.C. marks jurisdiction of the Judicial\n\nMagistrate in following manner:\n\n\"14. Local Jurisdiction of Judicial\nMagistrates. - (1) Subject to the control of the High\nCourt, the Chief Judicial Magistrate may, from time to\ntime, define the local limits of the areas within which\nthe Magistrates appointed under section 11 or under\nsection 13 may exercise all or any of the powers with\nwhich they may respectively be invested under this\nCode:\n\n[Provided that the Court of a Special Judicial\nMagistrate may hold its sitting at any place within the\nlocal area for which it is established.]\n(2) Except as otherwise provided by such\ndefinition, the jurisdiction and powers of every such\nMagistrate shall extend throughout the district\n(3) Where the local jurisdiction of a Magistrate,\nappointed under section 11 or section 13 or section\n18, extends to an area beyond the district, or the\nmetropolitan area, as the case may be, in which he\nordinarily holds Court, any reference in this Code to\nthe Court of Session, Chief Judicial Magistrate or the\nChief Metropolitan Magistrate shall, in relation to such\nMagistrate, throughout the area within his local\njurisdiction, be construed, unless the context\notherwise requires, as a reference to the Court of\nSession, Chief Judicial Magistrate, or Chief\nMetropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be,\nexercising jurisdiction in relation to the said district or\nmetropolitan area.\"\n\n11. Chapter XIII of\nCr.P.C\n. in clear tone identify the place of\n\ninquiry or trial to be conducted by the Magistrate or Court of Sessions,\n\nwhich in ordinary course should be by a court within whose local\n\njurisdiction offence is committed, however has got certain exceptions so\n\nprescribed thereafter.\n\n12. The aforesaid provisions stood since before, never been\n\nbefore considered even after introduction of 498A\nIPC\ndid not speak with\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 6\n\nregard to territorial jurisdiction nor there happens to be any specific\n\nprovision persisting identifying\nSection 498A\nIPC not to be a continuing\n\none. Basically it relates with own perception and that has to be adjudged\n\nin the background of facts of each case, as narrated and placed before\n\nthe court.\n\n13. Whenever there happens to be controversy with regard to\n\nmode of construction of particular statute in connection with its\n\nappreciation regarding its application, the same has been taken into\n\nconsideration in\nPawan Kumar and others v. State of Haryana\nreported\n\nin AIR 1998 SC 958 and for better appreciation, the relevant paras are\n\nquoted below:\n\n\"13. When words in statute are referable to more\nthan one meaning, the established rule of construction\nis found in Heydon‟s case case (1584) 76 ER 637\nalso approved by this Court in\nBengal Immunity Co.\nLtd. v. State of Bihar\n, AIR 1955 SC 661 (674). The\nrule is to consider four aspects while construing an\nAct:\n\n[a] what was the law prior to the law which is\nsought to be interpreted:\n\n[b] what was the mischief or defect for which new\nlaw is made:\n\n[c] what is the remedy the law now provides; and\n[d] what is the reason of the remedy.\n\n14. The Court must adopt that construction which,\n\"suppresses the mischief and advances the remedy.\"\n\n14. Because of the fact that during stay of bride at the place of\n\ngroom, her marital place an unfortunate event is faced when she is\n\nsubjected to harassment as well as cruelty for the purpose of procurement\n\nof the dowry or other article from her parental place on account thereof, to\n\nput safeguard upon her interest,\nSection 498A\nIPC has been introduced\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 7\n\nby way of an amendment under the\nIPC\n. So, introduction of Section 498A\n\nhappens to be benevolent one for the protection of the bride.\nThe Hindu\n\nMarriage Act\ndid not prescribe any provision nor recognizes shifting of\n\nbride to the place of groom, that means to say at her Sasural but is\n\ngoverned by a precedent, custom, rituals which is universally\n\nacknowledged and could be taken under judicial notice thereof unless and\n\nuntil contrary is proved identifying place of groom to be the place of\n\nresidence after marriage and the reason behind is that after marriage, a\n\nbride became part and parcel of groom‟s family, her welfare is found\n\ninfused with the welfare of the groom‟s family, she is to bear a child\n\npaving a way of inheritance. Thus, the bride is expected in normal\n\nphenomenon to stay at her matrimonial place unless and until some other\n\ncircumstance so visualize and for that, so many contingency are\n\nresponsible one of it being ousted thereof on account of cruelty or\n\nharassment for procurement of dowry. Therefore, depriving the bride her\n\nlegal, social, religious, customary right by not allowing her to stay at her\n\nmatrimonial place, would compel the bride to face mental agony, and such\n\nevent would not warrant continuing offence appears to be pivotal\n\nquestion, to be empowered. Therefore, proper recognition to her at the\n\nplace of her Sasural where she is to live with full dignity and honour and\n\nfurther, should not fell victim of an evil of the society on the score of\n\ndemand of dowry or unrecognized lust of Sasuralwala,\nSection 498A\nof\n\nthe IPC has been introduced. It is also found that considering the gradual\n\nrise in causing death of a female at her Sasural on that very score within\n\nseven years from the date of marriage has been viewed seriously and for\n\nthat necessary amendments have been brought up under the\nIndian\n\nEvidence Act\nas well as Penal Code subsequently. Therefore, the aim and\n\nambit of introduction of\nSection 498A\nIPC as it reveals, happens to be in\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 8\n\nfavour of bride in order to protect herself and so interpretation of\nSection\n\n498A\nof the IPC should be viewed accordingly.\n\n15. If the bride did not accede with the demand for which she is\n\nforced to physical as well as mental torture, harassment at her Sasural,\n\nshe is being thrown from her Sasural forcing her to stay away therefrom,\n\nsometimes at her Maika and sometimes may be at different place and\n\nwhether this event could be perceived an outcome of continuing offence,\n\nwhereunder bride is found illegally denied to exercise her legal, customary\n\nright by having her stay at her Sasural and more recently, under Domestic\n\nViolence Act the aforesaid theme has been perceived whereunder right of\n\nresidence has duly been acknowledged apart from others and in likewise\n\nmanner, asking for maintenance for which there happens to be absence\n\nof any condition for drawing any kind of legal proceeding at the place\n\nwhere she at present resides.\n\n16.\nIn\nGananath Pattnaik vs. State of Orissa\nreported in\n\n2002(2) PLJR 83(SC), cruelty in terms of\nSection 498A\nIPC has been\n\nexplained in following way:\n\n\"6. We do not agree with the argument of the\nlearned counsel for the appellant that even on\nproof of the aforesaid circumstances, as noticed\nby the trial court, no case was made out against\nthe appellant as, according to him, those facts\neven proved do not constitute cruelty for the\npurposes of attracting the provisions of\nSection\n498A\nof the Indian Penal Code. Cruelty for the\npurposes of aforesaid section has been defined\nunder the Explanation of the Section to mean:\n\n\"(a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature\nas is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide\nor to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or\nhealth (whether mental or physical) of the woman;\nor\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such\nharassment is with a view to coercing her or any\nperson related to her to meet any unlawful\ndemand for any property or valuable security or is\non account of failure by her or any person related\nto her to meet such demand.\"\n\n7. The concept of cruelty and its effect varies from\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 9\n\nindividual to individual also depending upon the\nsocial and economic status to which such person\nbelongs. \"Cruelty\" for the purposes of constituting\nthe offence under the aforesaid section need not\nbe physical. Even mental torture or abnormal\nbehaviour may amount to cruelty and harassment\nin a given case.\"\n\n17.\nIn\nArun Khanna vs. The State of Bihar and another\n\nreported in 1994(1) PLJR 513, it has been held:\n\n\"7.\nSection 498A\nIndian Penal Code provides for\npunishment to husband or relative of husband of a\nwoman subjected to cruelty. Explanation appended to\nthe section defines „cruelty‟ to mean:\n\n\"(a) any willful conduct which is of such a\nnature as is likely to drive the woman to commit\nsuicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life,\nlimb or health (whether mental or physical) of the\nwoman; or\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such\nharassment is with a view to coercing her or any\nperson related to her to meet any unlawful\ndemand for any property or valuable security or is\non account of failure by her or any person related\nto her to meet such demand.\"\n\nA bare perusal of the provision would indicate that\nif a person is found guilty of any willful conduct which\nis of such nature as is likely to drive the woman to\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to\nlife, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the\nwoman or guilty of an act of harassment relating to\ndemand for any property under Section 498A.\nReading of the complaint leaves no room for doubt\nthat the allegations made therein do prima facie,\nconstitute the ingredients of the said office. The only\nquestion is regarding territorial jurisdiction or the\nplace of enquiry or trial.\n\n8. In the instant case, the complainant has alleged\nthat by reason of the conduct of the accused persons,\nshe was forced to leave her matrimonial home. If the\nact of cruelty had not been committed and there was\nno danger to her life and health, there perhaps would\nhave been no occasion for her to leave the house.\nShe has also alleged that as a consequence of the\nacts of the accused persons she is suffering mental\nagony at Dhanbad. In other words, the wrong or the\noffence is still continuing. In my opinion, the term\n„cruelty‟ in Section 498A has to be given an extended\nmeaning. If the woman continues to suffer the mental\nagony or torture as a result of the acts done to her by\nthe husband or his relatives forcing her to leave the\nmatrimonial home, it must be said that the cruelty is\ncontinuing. While construing the question of\njurisdiction with respect to offence under section\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 10\n\n498A one should not forget the social background\nand the object for which the said offence has been\ncreated. This new penal provision is intended to\nprovide benefit and relief to the females who\nconstitute the weaker section of the society, the\ndestitutes who have been turned out of the husband‟s\nhome. If they are to be compelled to file the complaint\nonly at the place where the act was committed, that\nis, at the place where the husband/in-laws reside, she\nmay not be able to prosecute the complaint property\nwhich will not serve the desired object. A learned\nSingle Judge of this Court in the case of Sardar\nHarpal Singh reported in 1991 Eastern India Criminal\nCases 756, relied upon by Mr. M.M. Benerjee on\nbehalf of the opposite party, has taken the same view\nand I find myself in respectful agreement with the\nsame.\"\n\n18.\nIn\nJagdish and others vs. State of Rajasthan and\n\nanother\nreported in 1998 CRI.L.J. 554, it has been held:\n\n\"7. If repeated demand for dowry is made and\nharassment is meted out to a woman which may be\nphysical or mental is an act of cruelty. It is not\nnecessary that the husband or his relatives must be\npresent at the time when the house wife is subjected\nto cruelty. If their act or conduct, omission or\ncommission is of such a nature which results in\nmental and physical harassment it will amount to an\nact of cruelty to a woman and it is immaterial that the\nwoman is living at that relevant time at her\nmatrimonial home or at her parents house. The\noffence under Section 498A is a continuing office and\nif the act of cruelty continues even while, the woman\nis living at her parents house, the offence is triable by\nboth the Courts in whose territorial jurisdiction the act\nof continuing offence of cruelty has been committed\nat matrimonial home or the parents house. In the\ninstant case prima facie it has been shown that\nNarayani was subjected to cruelty at her matrimonial\nhome Binjbayala and she was compelled to leave the\nmatrimonial home due to the threats given by the\npetitioners. It has been further stated that when she\nwas living at her parents house the petitioners\ninsisted on their demand for Rs. one lac failing which\nshe will have to remain at her parents house. This\nprima facie at this stage shows that the petitioners\ncontinued to cause harassment to Narayani with a\nview to coerce her to satisfy their unlawful demand\ni.e. to compel her to live at her parents house.\nTherefore, prima facie it appears that she has been\nsubjected to cruelty at Manak Khedi within the\ndefinition of „cruelty‟ given in the explanation of\n\nSection 498A\nI.P.C. On taking into consideration the\nF.I.R. and the papers under investigation i.e. the\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 11\n\nstatements of witnesses, it appears that act of\nmaltreatment and humiliation by the petitioners\ncontinued even while Narayani was residing with her\nparents. Therefore, I am of the view that Clause (c) of\n\nSection 178\n, Criminal Procedure Code is clearly\nattracted and the learned Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Suratgarh has also territorial jurisdiction\nto try the case against the petitioners under\nSection\n498A\n, I.P.C. which is a continuing offence.\n\n10. There is one more important aspect of the\ncase that when complainant wife was maltreated and\nsubjected to cruelty so much so that she feared for\nher life due to the threats given by the petitioners, the\nconsequences of all the above acts of the petitioners\nensued at Manak Khedi that she was compelled to\nleave her matrimonial home and to reside with her\nparents at Manak Khedi. She was not being called\nback to force her and parents to fulfil the unlawful\ndemand of dowry.\nSection 179\n, Cr.P.C. says that\nwhere an act is an offence by reason of anything\nwhich has been done and all the consequences\nwhich have ensued, the offence may be enquired by\na Court within whose local jurisdiction such thing has\nbeen done or such consequence has ensued. I am of\nthe view that\nSection 179\n, Cr.P.C. is also attracted to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case and the\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Suratgarh has\nclearly territorial jurisdiction to try the offences.\"\n\n19.\nIn\nBimlesh Kumar Saraf & Ors. vs. Smt. Chetna Saraf &\n\nAnr.\nreported in 1997(2) PLJR 266, it has been held:\n\n\"7. Apparently in the complaint petition, allegation\nwas levelled that the complainant was assaulted and\ntortured in various ways so that her relation may be\ncompelled to fulfil the unlawful demand of dowry as\nalleged in the complaint petition and the complainant\nwas also driven out of the matrimonial house on\n17.7.90 and she was forced to live at Katras in the\nhouse of her brother. No doubt\nu/s 177\nCr.P.C. which\nis the jurisdiction chapter of the criminal trial, every\noffence shall ordinarily be enquired into and tried by\na court within whose local jurisdiction it was\ncommitted. But\nSection 179\nCr.P.C. which is a\nspecial provision, only to meet such contingency, and\nto mitigate the hardship of the weaker sections, a\nprovision has been made that where an act is an\noffence by reason of anything which has been done\nand the consequence which has ensured, the\noffence may be enquired into or tried by a court\nwithin whose local jurisdiction such thing has been\ndone or such consequence has ensued. So the true\ntest will be that the consequence must be an\nessential ingredient of the offence and something\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 12\n\nwhich forms part and parcel of it or completes the\noffence; meaning thereby that the consequence must\nbe so iner-linked that the consequence is the direct\nresult of the act and if the wife is compelled due to\ntorture and harassment to leave the matrimonial\nhouse, then it is the direct result of the alleged action\nof the petitioners.\n\nFurthermore the complainant though living at\nKatras within the jurisdiction of the Dhanbad court,\nshe is under the constant agony and mental torture is\nalso there and as she was forced to leave the\nmatrimonial house, the harassment is continung to\ncompel her relation to fulfil the dowry demand. In that\nview of the matter, even though the complainant is in\nKatras, still she is constantly under mental agony and\nalso under constant harassment and cruelty, so that\nthe illegal demand of the petitioners can be fulfilled\nby her relation. In that view of the matter, for the\nillegal action done at Muzaffarpur, a direct\nconsequence has ensued even at Katras and such\noffence is also a continuing offence because the\ncomplainant is continuously feeling harassment and\ntorture though the mental harassment is also there.\n\n8. A Bench of this Court in\nArun Khanna vs.\nState of Bihar\nreported in 1994 Vol.\n1 PLJR 513\nalso took a similar view and in that case also the\nallegation of torture and harassment and also cruelty\nwas levelled for the period when the wife was in\nAmritsar in her matrimonial house and she was\nforced to leave the matrimonial house and to live at\nDhanbad in the house of her parents and from there\nshe filed a case u/s. 498 and 406 IPC and it was held\nby a Bench of this Court that the complaint case is\nmaintainable before the Dhanbad court also in view\nof the provision of Section 179 Cr.P.C.\n\n9. Furthermore the Calcutta High Court in the\ncase of Motahar Hussain reported in 1995 C Cr.L.R.\n(Cal) 43 also held that the offence\nu/s. 498\nIPC is a\ncontinuing offence and the court where the\ncomplainant resides had the jurisdiction to proceed\nwith the case. So far the case of Andhra Pradesh\nHigh Court, that is, Rajaram case (supra) as relied\nupon by the learned lawyer for the petitioner, is not\napplicable for the reason that in that case it was held\nthat the allegation that her husband and sister in-law\nvisited the place where the wife was residing, had not\nbeen substantiated. Moreover, the provision of\n\nSection 179\nCr.P.C. as discussed above had not at\nall been considered in that case.\"\n\n20. In Pabitra Chaudhary & others vs. The State of Bihar &\n\nothers reported in 2007 (Suppl) PLJR 57 it has been held:\n\n\"8. On behalf of the petitioners reliance has been\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 13\n\nplaced in a case of\nY. Abraham Ajith and Ors. vs.\nInspector of Police, Chennai and Anr.\n[2004(8)\nSCC 100]. In thisdecision from the facts it would\nappear that all the alleged offences had taken place\nat Nagercoil and none at Chennai. It was further held\nthat normally the general rule is that ordinarily every\noffence should be enquired into and tried by a court\nwithin whose local jurisdiction it was committed. This\nrule is, however, subject to several exceptions and\none of them is contained in Section 178(c) of the\nCode which provides that where the offence is a\ncontinuous one it must be continued to be committed\nin more local areas than one, then courts of all those\nareas will have jurisdiction to try any such offence. In\nthis case, however, no offence was committed at\nChennai and, therefore, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nhas held that this is not a case of continuing offence\nso as to attract the provision of Section 178(c) of the\nCode.\n\n9.\nIn this connection a reference may also be made\nto the case of\nSujata Mukherjee (Smt.) vs.\nPrashant Kumar Mukherjee\n[(1997)5 SCC 30]. In\nthis case the offence was continued to be committed\nat the place of her parents where she came away\nfrom her Sasural. It was held that since the offence\nwas a continuing one the courts at her father's place\nwill also have jurisdiction to try the offence by virtue\nof Section 178(c) of the Code.\n\n10. The question what could constitute a continuing\noffence had come up for consideration before the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nState of Bihar\nvs. Deokaran Nenshi and Anr.*\n[(1972)2 SCC 890].\nIt's paragraph no. 5 runs as follows:--\n\n\"5. A continuing offence is one which is\nsusceptible of continuance and is\ndistinguishable from the one which is\ncommitted once and for all. It is one of those\noffences which arises out of a failure to obey\nor comply with a rule or its requirement and\nwhich involves a penalty, the liability for which\ncontinues until the rule or its requirement is\nobeyed or complied with. On every occasion\nthat such disobediance or non-compliance\noccurs and reoccurs, there is the offence\ncommitted. The distinction between the two\nkinds of offences is between an act or\nomission which constitutes an offence once\nand for all and a act or omission which\ncontinues and, therefore, constitutes a fresh\noffence every time or occasion on which it\ncontinues. In the case of a continuing offence,\nthere is thus the ingredient of continuance of\nthe offence which is absent in the case of an\noffence which takes place when an act or\nomission is committed once and for all.\"\n\n11. This definition of a continuing offence has been\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 14\n\nquoted with the approval by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in the case of\nManish Ratan and Ors. vs.\nState of M.P. and Anr\n. [(2007)1 SCC 262)].\n\n12.\nIn this connection a reference may also be made\nto the case of\nAbdul Nazar Madani vs. State of T.N.\nand Anr.\n[(2000)6 SCC 204]. It was held by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in this case that the purpose\nof criminal trial is fair and impartial justice\nuninfluenced by anything. If it appears that was not\npossible impartially at any place dispensation of\njustice the appropriate court may transfer the case to\nanother court where it feels that the trial would fair\nconducive to justice.\n\n13.\nIn the case of\nMohan Baitha & Ors. vs. State of\nBihar & Ors.\n(2001(2) PLJR (SC)83) from the facts it\nwould appear that F.I.R. was lodged at Bhagalpur\nunder\nSections 304B\nand\n/\nof the Indian Penal\nCode on receiving a telephone call by the father for\nthe victim that she died at Jahanaganj in U.P. while\npreparing milk for the child. It was held that in a given\ncase indicating proximity of time, unity or proximity of\nplace, continuity of action and continuity of purpose\nor design are the factors for deciding whether certain\nacts form parts of the same transactions or not.\nSection 221 will be decided on these factors and\nSection 177 is, therefore, not peremptory in nature\nnor a complete imbargo.\n\n14.\nIn a recent decision in the case\nKunti Devi &\nOrs. vs. The State of Bihar\n(2007(2) PLJR 43) the\nlearned Single Judge (Navin Sinha, J.) has decided\nwhat is meant \"ordinary courts in Section 171\" which\naccording to him need not be limited to the special\nprovision provided for by law.\"\n\n21.\nIn\nShankar Prasad Das & Ors. Vs. The State of Bihar &\n\nAnr.\nreported in 2003(3) PLJR 813, it has been held:\n\n\"6. I do not find any substance in this submission of\nMr. Roy. True it is that in column of place of\noccurrence the informant has stated that the same\nhad taken place at Deoghar but in the same column\nshe had further stated that occurrence had taken\nplace subsequent thereto. For ascertaining the\njurisdiction the allegation made in the first\ninformation report has to be seen. In the first\ninformation report the informant has clearly stated\nthat on failure of her father to fulfil the illegal\ndemand of dowry, her husband and other family\nmembers, who are opposite party nos. 2 to 9 before\nthis Court, after retaining all her ornaments, driven\nher out from her matrimonial home and since then\nshe is living with her father.\nThus the cruelty meted\nout to the informant still continues at Gaya where\nshe is living with her father. In my opinion, the\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 15\n\nallegation made in the first information report\nreveals continued offence of maltreatment to the\ncomplainant at Gaya and as such Gaya court shall\nhave jurisdiction to try the offence. Reference in\nthis connection can be made to a decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of\nSujata Mukherjee vs\nPrashant Kumar Mukherjee\n[(1997) 5 SCC 30]. In\nthe said case in paragraph 7 the Supreme Court\nhas held as follows :\n\n\"Despite service being effected on the private\nrespondents, no one has appeared for any of\nthe accused respondents. We have taken into\nconsideration the complaint filed by the\nappellant and it appears to us that the\ncomplaint reveals a continuing offence of\nmaltreatment and humiliation meted out to the\nappellant in the hands of all the accused\nrespondents and in such continuing offence,\non some occasions all the respondents had\ntaken part. Therefore, clause (c) of\nSection\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure is\nclearly attracted. We, therefore, set aside the\nimpugned order of the High Court and directed\nthe learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur to\nproceed with the criminal case. Since the\nmatter is pending for long, steps should be\ntaken to expedite the hearing. The appeals are\naccordingly allowed.\"\n\n22.\nIn\nRaja Ram Chaudhary @ Raja Ram & others vs. The\n\nState of Bihar & another\nreported in 2005 (4) PLJR 741 which was filed\n\nby petitioners/accused for transfer of the proceeding wherein it has been\n\nheld:\n\n\"5.\nSection 179\nof the Cr.P.C. reads as follows:--\n\n179. Offence triable where act is done or\nconsequence ensues: -- \"When an act is an\noffence by reason of anything which has been\ndone and of a consequence which has ensued,\nthe offence may be inquired into or tried by a\nCourt within whose local jurisdiction such thing\nhas been done or such consequence has\nensued.\"\n\n6.\nSection 179\nCr.P.C. is in the nature of\nexception to general rule that every offence shall\nbe inquired into and tried by the court within\nwhose jurisdiction it was committed. This section\nprovides that an act is an offence by reason of\nsection which has ensued, the offence may be\nenquired into and tried by the court within whose\nlocal jurisdiction the act was committed or where\nthe act has ensued where the wife has been\nforced to leave her husband or the in-laws house\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 16\n\ndue to torture. Leaving of the house is direct\nresult or consequence of conduct and are integral\npart of the act done. The complainant was\ntortured by the accused persons at Patna. She\nwas assaulted and threatened by the accused\npersons due to which she was compelled to leave\nher matrimonial house. She was forced to meet\nunlawful demand of accused persons or to leave\nher matrimonial house. Lastly the accused\npersons forced the complainant to leave her\nmatrimonial house. She was driven out of her\nmatrimonial house with her children. All her\nbelongings were taken away by the accused\npersons. Her father brought her to Bhabhua\nwhere she was treated for her mental and\nphysical ailment.\n\n7. Counsel for the opposite party submits that the\nopposite party no. 2 is residing at Bhabhua and\nthat gives jurisdiction to the Bhabhua court to try\nsuch nature of offence as provided under section\n179 Cr. P.C. Counsel for\nthe opposite parties has placed reliance on\ndecisions in the case of\nGirdhari Lal Jatana and\nOrs. vs. The State of Bihar and Anr.\n, [1997(1)\nP.L.J.R. 513] and in the case of\nDr. Animesh\nGupta and Anr. vs. The State of Bihar and Ors.\n\n[2004(2) P.L.J.R. 483].\n\nIn 1997(1) P.L.J.R. 513\n(\nArun Khanna vs. The State of Bihar and Anr.\n)\nit has been held as follows:--\n\n\"In the instant case, the complainant has alleged\nthat by reason of the conduct of the accused\npersons she was forced to leave her matrimonial\nhome. If the act of cruelty had not been\ncommitted and there was no danger to her life\nand health, there perhaps would have been no\noccasion for her to leave the house. She has also\nalleged that as a consequence of the acts of the\naccused persons she is suffering mental agony at\nDhanbad. In other words, the wrong or the\noffence is still continuing. In my opinion, the term\n\"cruelty\" in Section 498A has to be given an\nextended meaning. If the woman continues to\nsuffer the mental agony or torture as a result of\nthe acts done to her by the husband or his\nrelatives forcing her to leave the matrimonial\nhome, it must be said that the cruelty is\ncontinuing. While construing the question of\njurisdiction with respect to offence under section\n498A one should not forget the social background\nand the object for which the said offence has\nbeen created. This new penal provision is\nintended to provide benefit and relief to the\nfemales who constitute the weaker section of the\nsociety, the destitute who have been turned out of\nthe husband's home. If they are to be compelled\nto file the complaint only at the place where the\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 17\n\nact was committed, that is, at the place where the\nhusband/in-laws reside, she may not be able to\nprosecute the complaint properly which will not\nserve the desired object.\"\n\n23.\nIn\nSurendra Nath Choubey & Others vs. The State of\n\nBihar & Another\nreported in 2007(2) PLJR (HC) 47, it has been held:\n\n\"6. So far the second submission is concerned,\nthe facts alleged in complaint petition would go to\nshow that this case falls under\nsection 179\n\nCr.P.C. and not under sections 177 or 178\n\nCr.P.C\n.\nSection 179\nCr.P.C. runs as follows:\n\n\"179. Offence triable where act is done or\nconsequence ensues .--When an act is an\noffence by reason of anything which has been\ndone and of a consequence which has ensued,\nthe offence may be inquired into or tried by a\nCourt within whose local jurisdiction such thing\nhas been done, or such consequence has\nensued.\"\n\n7. According to paragraph-13 of the fardbeyan-\ncum-complaint petition, the victim after assault\nwas driven out of the petitioners' house situated in\nBuxar district. Thereafter, she was compelled to\ntake shelter in her parents house at Chapra.\nTherefore, consequences of torture ensued at\nChapra where the victim was compelled to take\nshelter after eviction from her Sasural. Therefore\ncourt of Chapra had also jurisdiction to entertain\nthe case.\n\n8. The above cited apex court decision in this\ncase is not applicable which is apparent from the\nfacts mentioned in paragraph-11 of the judgment.\nIn that very case, the victim voluntarily left her\nSasural and was not driven out by her in-laws.\"\n\n24.\nIn\nVagish Kumar vs. State of Bihar\nreported in 2004(4)\n\nPLJR 688, it has been held:\n\n\"4. So far question whether the offence under\n\nsection 498A\n, I.P.C. was time barred, it has to be\nexamined whether an offence under\nSection\n498A\n, I.P.C. refers to physical tortures only. The\nwordings in\nSection 498A\n, I.P.C. refers to cruelty\nto a woman by her husband or his relatives. This\ncruelty has been explained thus-\n\n\"(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature\nas is likely to drive woman to commit suicide or to\ncause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health\n(whether mental or physical) of the woman; or (b)\nharassment of the woman\nwhere such harassment is with a view to coercing\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 18\n\nher or any person related to her to meet any\nunlawful demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity or is on account of failure by her or any\nperson related to her to meet such demand.\"\n\n5. From the aforesaid wordings used in the\naforesaid section regarding cruelty meted out to a\nwife, it is apparent that it is not only the physical\ntortures, assaults etc. which amount to cruelty.\nThe demand of any property including money\npersistently will also be included in the mental\ntorture or cruelty being committed upon the wife\nby the husband or by his family members. The\npersistent demands, so long as wife remains at\nthe house of her husband or even at the house of\nher father, will be a continuing cruelty to the wife.\nIn the instance case, the alleged complaint case\nwas filed on 03.07.1996, as stated at paragraph-li\nof the quashing application. The alleged divorce\nsuit ended in a judgment on 23.08.1996, as\nstated in paragraph-9 of the quashing application\nso apparently divorce suit ended in a decree in\nfavour of the petitioners of this quashing\napplication. The complaint was filed on\n03.07.1996 itself and on that date the\ncomplainant's daughter was still the wife of her\nhusband Vagish Kumar. The demand of rupees\nfour to five lacs was continuing upto the date\nwhen the complaint was filed, as has been stated\nby the complainant in his complaint petition, and it\nwas under these circumstances that the husband\nhad refused to take back his wife unless his\ndemands were fulfilled, that the complainant was\ncompelled to file his complaint petition so the\ndemand of rupees four to five lacs was a\ncontinuing demand and in this view of the matter,\nwhen the complaint was filed, the offence of\ncruelty, as defined under\nSection 498A\n, I.P.C.,\nwas not yet time barred. So far the allegation that\nit was the wife herself who had deserted her\nhusband and for which there was a matrimonial\nsuit which ended in a decree in favour of the\nhusband, it is to be noted that, during the course\nof submission, it was admitted that the divorce\ndecree was still pending in appeal so there was\nno finality to the judgment of divorce and, hence,\nthe allegation of the husband that he was\ndeserted by his wife, the complainant's daughter,\ncannot be accepted as the final truth. So the\ndesertion of the complainant's daughter by her\nhusband or the allegation of the husband\nregarding his desertion by the wife are all\ndisputed facts which can be decided only by the\ntrial Court. This court cannot take into\nconsideration the divorce decree in order to come\nto a definite conclusion.\"\n\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 19\n\n25.\nIn\nMohan Baitha & others vs. State of Bihar & Anr\n.\n\nreported in 2001 PLJR 83 (SC) it has been held:\n\n\"4. Mr. P.S. Mishra, the learned senior counsel,\nappearing for the accused persons contended that\nunder\nSection 177\nof the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, an offence could be inquired and tried by\nthe Court in whose local jurisdiction, it was\ncommitted and consequently on the basis of\nallegations made in the F.I.R. as well as the\ncomplaint filed, the incident constituting the alleged\noffence under Section 304B being at Jahanaganj\n(Azamgarh) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the\nMagistrate at Bhagalpur in the State of Bihar will not\nhave territorial jurisdiction to try the offence. Mr.\nMishra also further contended that on the basis of\nallegations made, no offence under\nSection 406\nIPC\ncan be said to have been constituted. On examining\nthe assertions in the F.I.R. and the complaint as well\nas on scrutinizing the judgment of the learned Single\nJudge of Patna High Court, which is the subject\nmatter of challenge, we do not find any substance in\neither of the contentions raised by Mr. Mishra. So far\nas the contention relating to the constitution of\noffence under Section 406 is concerned, we are not\nrequired to examine the same, since the accused\nnever assailed the criminal proceedings itself on the\nground that no offence under\nSection 406\nIPC can be\nsaid to have been committed. The accused merely\nassailed the territorial jurisdiction of the criminal court\nat Bhagalpur in relation to offence under Section\n304B on the ground that the said offence stood\ncommitted in Uttar Pradesh.\nSection 177\nof the Code\nof Criminal Procedure on which Mr. Mishra relies,\nuses the expression \"ordinarily\". The use of the word\n\"ordinarily\" indicates that the provision is a general\none and must be read subject to the special\nprovisions contained in the\nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\nThat apart, this Court has taken the view that the\nexceptions implied by the word \"ordinarily\" need not\nbe limited to those specially provided for by the law\nand exceptions may be provided by law on\nconsiderations of convenience or may be implied\nfrom other provisions of law permitting joint trial of\noffences by the same court (See\nPurshottamdas\nDalmia vs. The State of West Bengal\n, 1962(\n2) SCR\n101, L. N. Mukherjee vs. The State of Madras\n,\n1962(\n2) SCR 116 and Banwari Lal Jhunjhunwala and\nOrs. vs. Union of India\nand anr., 1963 Supp.\n(2) SCR\n\n338). Even the Law Commission in its 41st Report\nhad observed that the general rule\nlaid down in\n\nSection 177 is neither exclusive nor peremptory. The\nlearned Single Judge while dismissing the contention\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 20\n\nraised by the accused has relied upon\nSection 220\nof\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure and considering the\nnarration of events culminating in the death of\nKalpana, which constitutes offence under\nSection\n304B\nof the IPC, the learned Single Judge has come\nto a conclusion that there appears to exist a\ncontinuity of action to attract sub-section (1) of\nsection 220, and therefore, it cannot be said that the\njurisdiction of the Magistrate at Bhagalpur is ousted\nto try the offence under Section 304B. The High\nCourt also has casually observed that the assertions\nmade prima facie constitute an offence under Section\n498A and since the accused has approached the\nCourt even before the Magistrate has applied his\nmind to the result of the investigation on the basis of\nthe allegations made by the informant/complainant, it\nwould not be appropriate to express any definite\nopinion on the same. According to Mr. Mishra, from\nthe tenor of the impugned judgment, it can be well\nimagined that the judgment is rather strained one\nand has been passed in view of the earlier directions\nand by no stretch of imagination, the incident\nconstituting the offence under Section 304B can be\nheld to be one falling under\nSection 220\nof the Code\nof Criminal Procedure, so as to be tried along with\nthe offence under Section 406 at Bhagalpur. It may\nbe noticed that under\nSection 220\nof the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, offences more than one\ncommitted by the same persons could be tried at one\ntrial, if they can be held to be in one series of acts, so\nas to form the same transaction. The expression\n\"same transaction\" from its very nature is incapable\nof an exact definition. It is not intended to be\ninterpreted in any artificial or technical sense.\n\nCommon sense and the ordinary use of language\nmust decide whether on the facts of a particular\ncase, it can be held to be in one transaction. It is not\npossible to enunciate any comprehensive formula of\nuniversal application for the purpose of determining\nwhether two or more acts constitute the same\ntransaction. But the circumstances of a given case\nindicating proximity of time, unity or proximity of\nplace continuity of action and community of purpose\nor design are the factors for deciding whether certain\nacts form parts of the same transaction or not.\nTherefore a series of acts whether are so connected\ntogether as to form the same transaction is purely a\nquestion of fact to be decided on the aforesaid\ncriteria. Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles and\non scrutiny of the narration of events in the F.I.R. as\nwell as the complaint, we do not find any infirmity\nwith the conclusion of the High Court in applying\n\nSection 220\nof the Criminal Procedure Code to the\ncase in hand and in coming to the conclusion that the\njurisdiction of the Magistrate at Bhagalpur cannot be\nheld to have been ousted for the offence under\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 21\n\nSection 304B\nIPC. In the aforesaid premises, we see\nno merits in this appeal, which accordingly stands\ndismissed. The interim order of stay stands vacated\nand the Magistrate is directed to proceed with the\nmatter expeditiously, in accordance with law.\"\n\n26.\nIn\nSunita Kumari Kashyap vs. State of Bihar Anr\n.\n\nreported in (2011) 11 SCC 301, it has been held:\n\n\"8. Chapter XIII of the\nCode of Criminal\nProcedure\n, 1973 (in short \"the Code\") deals with\njurisdiction of the criminal courts in inquiries and\ntrials. Sections 177-179 are relevant which are as\nfollows:\n\n\"177. Ordinary place of inquiry and trial.--\nEvery offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and\ntried by a court within whose local jurisdiction it\nwas committed.\n\n178. Place of inquiry or trial.--(a) When it is\nuncertain in which of several local areas an\noffence was committed, or\n\n(b) where an offence is committed partly in one\nlocal area and partly in another, or\n\n(c) where an offence is continuing one, and\ncontinues to be committed in more local areas\nthan one, or\n\n(d) where it consists of several acts done in\ndifferent local areas,\nit may be inquired into or tried by a court having\njurisdiction over any of such local areas.\n\n179. Offence triable where act is done or\nconsequence ensues.--When an act is an\noffence by reason of anything which has been\ndone and of a consequence which has ensued,\nthe offence may be inquired into or tried by a court\nwithin whose local jurisdiction such thing has been\ndone or such consequence has ensued.\"\n\nFrom the above provisions, it is clear that the normal\nrule is that the offence shall ordinarily be inquired into\nand tried by a court within whose local jurisdiction it\nwas committed. However, when it is uncertain in\nwhich of several local areas an offence was\ncommitted or where an offence is committed partly in\none local area and partly in another or where an\noffence is a continuing one, and continues to be\ncommitted in more than one local area and takes\nplace in different local areas as per Section 178, the\ncourt having jurisdiction over any of such local areas\nis competent to inquire into and try the offence.\nSection 179 makes it clear that if anything happened\nas a consequence of the offence, the same may be\ninquired into or tried by a court within whose local\njurisdiction such thing has been done or such\nconsequence has ensued.\n\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 22\n\n9. Keeping the above provisions in mind, let us\nconsider the allegations made in the complaint. On\n17-10-2007, Sunita Kumari Kashyap, the appellant\nherein made a complaint to the Inspector-in-Charge,\nMagadh Medical College Police Station, Gaya. In the\ncomplaint, the appellant, after narrating her marriage\nwith Sanjay Kumar Saini, Respondent 2 herein on 16-\n4-2000 stated what had happened immediately after\nthe marriage at the instance of her husband and his\nfamily members‟ ill-treatment, torture and finally\ncomplained that she was taken out of the matrimonial\nhome at Ranchi and sent to her parental home at\nGaya with the threat that unless she gets her father‟s\nhouse in the name of her husband, she has to stay at\nher parental house forever. In the said complaint, she\nalso asserted that her husband pressurised her to get\nher father‟s house in his name and when she denied\nshe was beaten by her husband. It was also asserted\nthat after keeping her entire jewellery and articles, on\n24-12-2006, her husband brought her at Gaya and\nleft her there warning that till his demands are met,\nshe has to stay at Gaya and if she tries to come back\nwithout meeting those demands she will be killed. It\nwas also stated that from that date till the date of\ncomplaint, her in-laws never enquired about her.\nEven then she called them but they never talked to\nher.\n\n10. A perusal of the entire complaint, which was\nregistered as an FIR, clearly shows that there was ill-\ntreatment and cruelty at the hands of her husband\nand his family members at the matrimonial home at\nRanchi and because of their actions and threat she\nwas forcibly taken to her parental home at Gaya\nwhere she initiated the criminal proceedings against\nthem for the offences punishable under\nSections 498-\nA\nand\n/\nIPC and\nSections 3\nand\nof the DP\nAct. Among the offences, the offence under\nSection\n498-A\nIPC is the main offence relating to cruelty by\nhusband and his relatives. It is useful to extract the\nsame which is as under:\n\n\"498-A. Husband or relative of husband of a\nwoman subjecting her to cruelty.--Whoever,\nbeing the husband or the relative of the husband\nof a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall\nbe punished with imprisonment for a term which\nmay extend to three years and shall also be liable\nto fine.\n\nExplanation.--For the purposes of this section,\n„cruelty‟ means--\n\n(a) any wilful conduct which is of such a\nnature as is likely to drive the woman to\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or\ndanger to life, limb or health (whether mental\nor physical) of the woman; or\n\n(b) harassment of the woman where such\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 23\n\nharassment is with a view to coercing her or\nany person related to her to meet any unlawful\ndemand for any property or valuable security\nor is on account of failure by her or any person\nrelated to her to meet such demand.\"\n\n11. Similar allegations as found in the complaint in\nthe case on hand with reference to the offences\npunishable under\nSections 498-A\n,\n/\nIPC were\nconsidered by this Court in the following decisions.\n\n12.\nIn\nSujata Mukherjee v. Prashant Kumar\nMukherjee\n(1997)5 SCC 30 a similar issue was\nconsidered by this Court and found that clause (c) of\nSection 178 of the Code is attracted and the\nMagistrate at wife‟s parents‟ place has also\njurisdiction to entertain the complaint. In\nthe said\ndecision\n, wife was the appellant before this Court and\nthe respondents were the husband, parents-in-law\nand two sisters-in-law of the appellant Sujata\nMukherjee. The gist of the allegation of the appellant\nSujata Mukherjee was that on account of dowry\ndemands, she had been maltreated and humiliated\nnot only in the house of her in-laws at Raigarh but as\na consequence of such events, the husband of the\nappellant had also come to the house of her parents\nat Raipur and assaulted her. On behalf of the\nrespondents therein, it was contended before the\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur that the\ncriminal case was not maintainable before the said\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate because the cause\nof action took place only at Raigarh which was\noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the learned\nMagistrate at Raipur. A prayer was also made to\nquash the summons issued by the learned Chief\nJudicial Magistrate by entertaining the said complaint\nof Smt Mukherjee. As the Chief Judicial Magistrate\nwas not inclined either to quash the summons or to\ntransfer the criminal case to the competent court at\nRaigarh, the criminal revision petitions were filed\nbefore the High Court, one by all the five respondents\nand another by four of the respondents excluding the\nhusband presumably because there was specific\nallegation against the husband that the husband had\nalso gone to Raipur and had assaulted the appellant\nand as such the husband could not plead want of\nterritorial jurisdiction. Both the said criminal revision\ncases were disposed of by a common order dated 31-\n8-1989 by the High Court holding that the case\nagainst the husband of the appellant alone is\nmaintainable and in respect of other respondents\nrelated to the incidents taking place at Raigarh,\nhence, the criminal case on the basis of complaint\nmade by the appellant is not maintainable at Raipur.\nThe said order of the High Court was challenged by\nthe appellant Sujata Mukherjee in this Court. It was\nsubmitted that it will be evident from the complaint\nthat the appellant has alleged that she had been\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 24\n\nsubjected to cruel treatment persistently at Raigarh\nand also at Raipur and the incident taking place at\nRaipur is not an isolated event, but consequential to\nthe series of incidents taking place at Raigarh.\nTherefore, it was contended that the High Court was\nwrong in appreciating the scope of the complaint and\nproceeding on the footing that several isolated events\nhad taken place at Raigarh and one isolated incident\nhad taken place at Raipur. This Court basing reliance\non Section 178 of the Code, in particular clauses (b)\nand (c), found that in view of allegations in the\ncomplaint that the offence was a continuing one\nhaving been committed in more local areas and one\nof the local areas being Raipur, the learned\nMagistrate at Raipur had jurisdiction to proceed with\nthe criminal case instituted in such court.\n\n13. Ultimately, accepting the stand of the\nappellant, this Court held as under: (\nSujata\nMukherjee\ncase(1997)5 SCC 30, SCC p. 32, para 7)\n\"7. ... We have taken into consideration the\ncomplaint filed by the appellant and it appears to\nus that the complaint reveals a continuing offence\nof maltreatment and humiliation meted out to the\nappellant in the hands of all the respondent-\naccused and in such continuing offence, on some\noccasions all the respondents had taken part and\non other occasion, one of the respondents had\ntaken part. Therefore, clause (c) of\nSection 178\nof\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure is clearly\nattracted.\"\n\n14.\nIn\nState of M.P. v. Suresh Kaushal\n(2003)11\nSCC 126, again in a similar circumstance,\nconsidering the provisions of Section 179 with\nreference to the complaint relating to the offences\nunder Section 498-A read with\nSection 34\nIPC, this\nCourt held as under: (SCC p. 128, para 6)\n\"6. The above section contemplates two courts\nhaving jurisdiction and the trial is permitted to take\nplace in any one of those two courts. One is the\ncourt within whose local jurisdiction the act has\nbeen done and the other is the court within whose\nlocal jurisdiction the consequence has ensued.\nWhen the allegation is that the miscarriage took\nplace at Jabalpur it cannot be contended that the\ncourt at Jabalpur could not have acquired\njurisdiction as the acts alleged against the\naccused took place at Indore.\"\n\n15. Mr S.B. Sanyal, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing for the respondents fairly stated that there\nis no dispute about the jurisdiction of the Court at\nGaya insofar as against the husband, however, in\nrespect of other relatives of the husband in the\nabsence of any act at Gaya, the said court has no\njurisdiction and if at all, the wife has to pursue her\nremedy only at Ranchi. In support of his contention,\nhe relied on a decision of this Court in Y. Abraham\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 25\n\nAjith v. Inspector of Police\n(2004)8 SCC 100 in\nparticular, SCC para 12 of\nthe said decision\nwhich\nreads as under: (SCC p. 105)\n\"12. The crucial question is whether any part of\nthe cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of\nthe court concerned. In terms of Section 177 of\nthe Code, it is the place where the offence was\ncommitted. In essence it is the cause of action for\ninitiation of the proceedings against the accused.\"\n\n16. It is true that Section 177 of the Code refers to\nthe local jurisdiction where the offence is committed.\nThough the expression \"cause of action\" is not a\nstranger to criminal cases, in view of Sections 178\nand 179 of the Code and in the light of the specific\naverment in the complaint of the appellant herein, we\nare of the view that\nthe said decision\nis not applicable\nto the case on hand.\n\n17. Mr Sanyal also relied on a decision of this\nCourt in\nBhura Ram v. State of Rajasthan\n(2008)11\nSCC 103 wherein following the decision in Y.\nAbraham Ajith (2004)8 SCC 100 this Court held that\n\"cause of action\" having arisen within the jurisdiction\nof the court where the offence was committed, could\nnot be tried by the court where no part of offence was\ncommitted. For the same reasons, as mentioned in\nthe earlier paragraph, while there is no dispute as to\nthe proposition in view of the fact that in the case on\nhand, the offence was a continuing one and the\nepisode at Gaya was only a consequence of the\ncontinuing offence of harassment and ill-treatment\nmeted out to the complainant, clause (c) of Section\n178 is attracted. In view of the above reason, both the\ndecisions are not applicable to the facts of this case\nand we are unable to accept the stand taken by Mr\nSanyal.\n\n18. We have already adverted to the details made by\nthe appellant in the complaint. In view of the specific\nassertion by the appellant wife about the ill-treatment\nand cruelty at the hands of the husband and his\nrelatives at Ranchi and of the fact that because of\ntheir action, she was taken to her parental home at\nGaya by her husband with a threat of dire\nconsequences for not fulfilling their demand of dowry,\nwe hold that in view of Sections 178 and 179 of the\nCode, the offence in this case was a continuing one\nhaving been committed in more local areas and one\nof the local areas being Gaya, the learned Magistrate\nat Gaya has jurisdiction to proceed with the criminal\ncase instituted therein. In other words, as the offence\nwas a continuing one and the episode at Gaya was\nonly a consequence of continuing offence of\nharassment and ill-treatment meted out to the\ncomplainant, clause (c) of Section 178 is attracted.\nFurther, from the allegations in the complaint, it\nappears to us that it is a continuing offence of ill-\ntreatment and humiliation meted out to the appellant\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 26\n\nat the hands of all the accused persons and in such\ncontinuing offence, on some occasions all had taken\npart and on other occasions one of the accused,\nnamely, the husband had taken part, therefore,\nundoubtedly clause (c) of Section 178 of the Code is\nclearly attracted.\"\n\n27. Now coming to facts of the case, it is evident that\n\ncomplainant has asserted in specific tone that after assault she was\n\nousted from her matrimonial home, whereupon she took shelter at her\n\nmaika. Therefore, departure from her Sasural was not voluntarily, rather\n\nshe was ousted by the accused persons, and on account thereof, staying\n\nat her Sasural happens to be not in normal phenomenon rather, on\n\naccount of deprivation whereupon till her stay at Naihar will consistrue\n\ncontinuing offence . The relevant judicial pronouncement as referred\n\nabove consistently held so.\n\n28. Now coming to the judicial pronouncement having referred\n\nby the learned counsel for the petitioner, it is evident that in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, none is applicable.\nIn\nY. Abraham Ajith and\n\nothers v. Inspector of Police, Chennai and another\nreported in AIR\n\n2004 SC 4286 complainant herself deserted her matrimonial house hence\n\nthe principle decided\nin that case\n, happens to be to based upon aforesaid\n\nfacts.\n\nSimilar situation prevails with\nAmarendu Jyoti & Ors. v. State of\n\nChhattisgarh & Ors.\nreported in 2015(1) East. Cr.C 231 (SC).\n\n29. In Avinash Kumar Singh @ Avinash Kumar & Ors. v.\n\nThe State of Bihar & Anr. reported in 2015(4) East. Cr.C 738 (Pat)\n\nthough the facts of the case resembles, but after going through the\n\nsame, it is evident that neither the earlier decisions as\nreferred above\n\nwere considered nor the consequence of ousting from matrimonial house\n\nhas been considered, as is evident from para-7.\n\n\"However, here, under the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, the occurrence\nalleged to have taken place either at Delhi or at\nPatna High Court Cr.Misc. No.12180 of 2014 dt.12-01-2017 27\n\nPurnia, as per the allegation made, hence, as per\n\nSection 177\nof the Criminal Procedure Code the\nlocal area in which the occurrence took place has\njurisdiction as well as the exception as under\n\nSection 178\nof the Criminal Procedure Code that\nthe area where the part of the occurrence,\nalleged, occurred. Hence it can well be said that\nCourt at Delhi and Purnia has got jurisdiction as\nper\nSection 177\nand\nof the Criminal\nProcedure Code. However, the allegation is that\nthe demands were made at Delhi first then the\nvictim was taken to Purnia where further demand\nwas made and even the victim was assaulted and\nabused, her belongings were seized at her\nsasural in Purnia and, then, she was driven out of\nthe sasural and, then, she came to naiher at\nKatihar. However, no act alleged either of any\nomission and commission at Katihar has been\nmentioned in the entire complaint. There is no\nallegation whatsoever alleged at her naiher in\nKatihar.\"\n\n30. Likewise is the statues of Manoj Yadav @ Manoj Kumar\n\nYadav & Ors. with\nRaj Kumar Yadav @ Raj Kumar-1 & Ors. v. The\n\nState of Jharkhand & Anr.\nreported in 2015(4) East. Cr.C 741 (Jhr).\n\n31.\nRamesh Kumar Srivastava & Anr. v. State of Bihar &\n\nAnr.\nreported in 2009(2) East.\nCr.C 419, Mumtaz Bano Arzoo & Ors. v.\n\nState of Bihar & Anr. reported in 2010(1) East. Cr.C 243, Santokh\n\nSingh v. State of Jharkhand & Anr. reported in 2010(1) East. Cr.C 154\n\nare distinguishable on the facts of the case.\n\n32. Considering the factual as well as legal aspect, so involved,\n\nit is apparent that petitioner is not entitled to seek the relief as claimed for\n\nconsequent thereupon, instant petition is dismissed.\n\n(Aditya Kumar Trivedi, J.)\n\nPrakash Narayan\n\nAFR/NAFR AFR\nCAV DATE 19.11.2016\nUploading Date 13.01.2017\nTransmission 13.01.2017\nDate",
