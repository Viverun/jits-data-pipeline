Soumen Sen, J.:- The present reference is arising out of an\n\norder dated 22nd August, 2008 passed by the Division Bench of this Court in\n\nWP 12414(w) of 2008 (\nSmt. Rinku Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs.\n,) WP 12419(w) of 2008 (\nSrijit Pal v. The State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs.\n,) and WP 12420(w) of 2008 (\nSubimal Sinha v. The State of West\n\nBengal & Ors\n).\n2. The Division Bench upon noticing conflict between the views\n\nexpressed in two earlier coordinate bench decisions in\nTarak Chandra Roy\n\nv. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n, reported in 2008(2) CHN 973 (in short\n\n'Tarak') and the State of West Bengal & Ors. v. Sauvik Ghosh & Ors.\n\nreported in 2008(1) CLJ(Cal) 810 (in short 'Sauvik') formulated the\n\nfollowing questions for consideration by the larger Bench:\n\na) Whether in view of the fact that acquisition of higher\nqualification or qualifications during the service career of an\nindividual is his right and the same acts as an incentive to\ncareer advancement as well as acquiring a higher status of\nacademic brilliance, can such a person be forced to stagnate on\na lower status perennially and forced to continue to work on a\nlower scale of pay which is not commensurate to the higher\nqualification(s) acquired subsequent to his appointment?\n\nb) Whether in view of Question No.(a) above, should it not be\nheld that the ratio decided in\nTarak Chandra Roy\n's case (supra)\nread with the provisions of\nSections 14\nand\nof The West\nBengal Schools (Control and Expenditure) Act, 2005 amount to\ncreating an unreasonable embargo upon an individual's\nfreedom and right to acquire higher educational qualification(s)\nand therefore, runs counter to the provisions of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India?\n\nc) If the answer to question no. (a) is in the negative and to\nquestion no. (b) in the affirmative then should it not be held\nthat the provisions of\nSection 14\nand\nof The West Bengal\nSchools (Control and Expenditure) Act, 2005 are ultra vires the\nrelevant provisions of the Constitution of India\nreferred to\nabove\n?\nd) Whether in view of the aforesaid should it not be held that\nthe ratio decided in\nTarak Chandra Roy\n's case supra, holding\nthat \"the petitioner having been appointed in the pass category\nclearly, therefore, cannot get the benefit of his post graduate\nqualification\" is not the proper proposition and that the correct\nproposition is the one that has been decidied in Sauvik Ghosh's\nsupra holding, inter alia, in para 35 therein that if the\nGovernment order dated 18th July 1999 were to mean mutual\nfixation would be on the basis of the educational qualifications\nmentioned in the recommendation of the School Service\nCommission and a teacher appointed on the recommendation of\nthe School Service Commission would be bound by the\nqualification as mentioned in the recommendation for all time to\ncome and even on enhancement qualification the teacher would\nnot be entitled to the higher scale of pay only because the\nSchool Service Commission had mentioned a different\nqualification in its initial recommendation, the Government\nOrder would have to be struck down as totally arbitrary\ndiscriminatory and violative of\nArticle 14.........?\"\n\n3. Thereafter, another Division Bench in deciding FMA 2688 of\n\n2007 with\nCAN 2357 of 2010 Nirmalendu Maity v The State of West\n\nBengal\nupon noticing the constitution of a larger bench to answer the\n\naforesaid questions by an order dated 15th March, 2010 referred the\n\nfollowing question to the said larger Bench:\n\n\"Whether a teacher who has been appointed through West\nBengal School Service Commission in 'pass category' can get\nthe benefit of his post graduate qualification for the purpose of\ngetting post graduate scale of pay?\"\n4. Subsequently, by an order dated 6th September, 2019 Justice\n\nShampa Sarkar noticing apparent conflict in the views expressed in\n\nAnupam Santra v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\nin\nWP 25103 of 2012 and\n\nState of West Bengal & Ors. v. Chandra Bhusan Dwivedi\nin MAT 961 of\n\n2017 with regard to interpretation of Clause 12(5) of G.O. No. 25-\n\nSE(B)/IM-102/98 dated 12th February, 1999 and G.O. No. 46-\n\nSE(B)/5B/1/2009 dated 27th February, 2009 framed the following\n\nquestions for the larger bench to decide:-\n\n1. Whether with the introduction of G.O.\nNo.46‐SE(B)/5B‐1/2009 dated February 27, 2009 with\nretrospective effect from 1st January, 2006 and acceptance\nthereof by the petitioner prevented the petitioner from claiming\na higher scale of pay on the basis of a Ph.D. degree awarded\nprior to January 1, 2006 but convocation whereof was held on\nFebruary 24, 2006?\n\n2. Whether Clause 12(5) of G.O. No.25‐SE(B)/IM‐102/98\ndated February 12, 1999 implementing ROPA, 1998 would be\napplicable in case of the petitioner in view of the omission of\nsuch a provision in G.O. No.46‐SE(B)/5B‐1/2009 dated\nFebruary 27, 2009, with retrospective effect?\n\n5. It appears that a special leave petition was filed by one\n\nShohidullah against the State of West Bengal bearing Civil Appeal no. 3040-\n\n3041 of 2017 claiming higher scale of pay upon acquiring higher\n\nqualifications in which one Samsundar Mahato, Baishali Banerjee and\n\nSauvik Ghosh have filed applications raising similar issues.\n6. On 25th July, 2019 the Hon'ble Supreme Court after taking note\n\nof the order dated 22nd August, 2008 requested the High Court to expedite\n\nthe hearing of the matter before the full Bench.\n\nSubmission on behalf of the State of West Bengal\n\n7. The learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the State\n\nof West Bengal in answer to question (a) has submitted that:\n\na. Mere acquisition of a higher educational qualification does\nnot result in an automatic entitlement to a higher pay scale in the\nabsence of any law providing for the same.\n\nb. When the State decides to extend the benefit of a higher pay\nscale to a person for acquiring a higher qualification under a\nscheme for career advancement such a benefit is in the nature of\nan incentive framed under the executive policy of the State. These\nincentives are granted only after taking into consideration the\nfinancial implications of the same on the State exchequer. The\ncontinued existence of such incentives cannot be claimed as an\nenforceable right.\n\nc. The State is entitled to discontinue its policy to grant\nincentives at any time and no vested right can be claimed to such\nincentives given earlier on the basis of a previous superseded\npolicy of the State.\n\nd. Incentives granted by the State can only be claimed in\nterms of the provisions of the law made or policy formulated on\nthat behalf.\n\ne. It has been well settled by several decisions, including that\nof the Supreme Court of India, that courts should in the absence of\nany facially compelling reason disclosing arbitrariness, desist from\nstepping into the arena of decision making. Merely because the\ncourt has taken a view that a scheme for career advancement\nwould not be an equitable one is not a ground to set aside the\ndecision of the State, nor would the court direct reformulation of\nsuch scheme. Only a direction can be given to the State to\nconsider the matter and take a decision.\n\nf. In any event, the decision of the State not to grant the\nincentive of a higher pay scale for acquiring a higher qualification\nwould not necessarily mean that a person would be forced to\nstagnate on lower status perennially. It would be open for a person\nto make use of the opportunity to compete for another post with a\nhigher pay scale and also to utilise avenues for promotion to a\nhigher post.\n\n8. The learned Advocate General has referred to\nWazir Singh,\n\nJBT Teacher and Ors. v. State of Haryana\nthrough its Secretary,\n\nEducation Department and Ors., reported in 1995 Supp.(3) SCC 697 to\n\nargue that in a similar situation the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that\n\nthe appellants who have not acquired the B.T/B.Ed. before 9th March, 1990\n\ncannot claim the benefit of higher grade of pay scale automatically.\n\nThis\n\njudgment was followed in\nState of Haryana & Ors. v. Ravi Bala & Ors.\n,\n\nreported in 1997 (1) SCC 267 where it is stated:\n\n\"3. The appellants are teachers in Government schools in the\nState of Haryana. The appellants were appointed as (J.B.T.)\nteachers in the schools as they did not possess B.T./B.Ed.\nqualification at the time of their appointments. However, they\nacquired B.T. B.ed. degree on various dates as mentioned in\npage 9 of the S.L.P. Paper Book and also at page 53 (so far as\nnewly impleaded appellant No. 8 is concerned). They moved the\nHigh Count of Punjab & Haryana under Article 226/227 of the\nConstitution of India for the issue of writ of Mandamus directing\nthe respondents to give them the higher grade admissible to the\nMasters with effect from respective dates of their acquiring\nB.T./B.Ed. qualifications and they also prayed for issue of writ\nof Mandamus to the respondents to implement the decision/\ndirection of this Court in the case of\nChaman Lal v. State of\nHaryana\nreported in [1987]2SCR923 .\n\n4. In response to the notice of motion issued by the High Court,\nwritten statement on behalf of respondents was filed and\ntherein it was brought to the notice of the Court that the\nerstwhile Punjab Government's Instructions dated July 23,\n1957 on the basis of which the petitioners/ appellants rested\ntheir claims, stood superseded and no more applicable to the\nemployees of the Haryana Government. It was also stated in\nthe written statement that a policy decision was taken by the\nGovernment of Haryana in Finance Department Letter No. 7/2\n\n(i)/90-FRI dated March 9, 1990 stating that the pay-scales\nadmissible to the Masters, that is, B.A., B.Ed. would be given to\nsuch teachers who have been appointed against the posts for\nwhich the qualification is B.A. B.Ed. In the light of the written\nstatement and also applying the earlier decision of the High\nCourt in C.W.P. No. 14736 of 1991 dated December 1,1992, the\nlearned Judges held that the appellants were not entitled to the\nreliefs prayed for as they were never appointed against the\npost of Masters. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the writ petition,\nthe present special leave to appeal is preferred by the\nappellants.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the appellants strenuously urged before\nus that the ratio\nlaid down by\nthis Court in [1987] 2 SCR 923\n(supra) will apply in full force to the facts of this case and,\ntherefore, the appellants would be entitled to succeed in the\npresent appeal.\n\n6. Learned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted\nthat in\nChaman Lal\n's case this Court was considering the scope\nof the letter dated July 23, 1957 issued by the composite\nPunjab Government in the light of subsequent order of Haryana\nGovernment dated 5.9.79. However, in the present case the\nletter dated 23.7.57 stood superseded by the latest policy\ninstructions issued by the Haryana Govt. on 9.3.1990 and\ntherefore, the judgment in [1987]2SCR923 will be no avail. He\nalso invited our attention to the policy instructions contained in\nthe letter dated 9.3.1990 which is Annexure III to the Special\nLeave Petition found at page 44.\" (Emphasis supplied)\n\n9. Mr. Advocate General submits that parity in the pay on the\n\nbasis of qualifications could be claimed provided the rules permitting for it\n\nand it may not have any retrospective operation.\nIn\nState of Haryana &\n\nOrs. v. Kamal Singh Saharwat & Anr.\nreported in 1999 (8) SCC 44 the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court has clearly stated that teachers cannot claim higher\n\npay on the scales of pay applicable to lecturers merely on their acquiring\n\npost graduate qualification without being appointed as lecturers.\n\n10. Moreover, pay fixation is a complex matter and it is always\n\nadvisable to rely on the recommendation of the expert body more conversant\n\nwith the matter. The learned Advocate General has drawn attention to\n\nUnion of India & Ors. v. M.V. Mohanan Nair\nreported in 2020 (5) SCC\n\n421 (paragraphs 29 and 37) and submitted that higher scale of pay offered\n\nfor Career Advancement is in the nature of incentive so that the teachers\nwould work efficiently despite not getting promotion and it cannot be treated\n\nas a fundamental right. The government has right to frame policy to ensure\n\nefficient and proper administration and to provide suitable avenues for\n\npromotion to officers working in different departments. However, a new\n\npolicy introduced based on the recommendation of the experts or\n\nexperiment by expert bodies are not to be lightly interfered. Equal pay for\n\nequal work is not a fundamental right vested in any employee though it is a\n\nconstitutional goal to be achieved by the government. The Court should\n\napproach the matters with regard to the fixation of pay and determination of\n\nparities in respect of duties and responsibilities with due caution and\n\ninterfere only when it is irrational, unjust and prejudicial. The incentives in\n\nterms of financial benefits which is now being made as the foundation for\n\nhigher scale of pay being linked with higher qualification is analogous to\n\nmodified assured career progress scheme which is also reflected in Rule 12\n\nof ROPA 1990 and amended from time to time and those rules not being\n\nchallenged and not being found arbitrary and irrational are required to be\n\napplied in answering the reference.\n\nThe argument is based on the\n\nobservation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nM.V. Mohanan\n(supra) in\n\nparagraphs 3 to 5, 29, 36 to 38 and 56 which read:\n\n\"3. The main questions falling for consideration in these appeals are:\n\n(i) Whether MACP scheme entitles financial upgradation of pay\nto the next grade pay or to the grade pay of the next\npromotional post as envisaged under the ACP scheme? Whether\nMACP Scheme envisages grant of financial upgradation in\nGrade Pay Hierarchy and not in promotional hierarchy?\n(ii) As contended by the Respondents, whether MACP scheme is\ndisadvantageous to the employees in comparison to ACP\nscheme as long as the financial upgradation is granted in\nhierarchy of grade pay under MACP scheme?\n\n(iii) Whether Respondents are entitled to stepping up of their\ngrade pay to be at par with grade pay of their juniors who were\ngetting the higher grade pay on account of implementation of\nMACP Scheme?\n\n4. Appeals relating to Issue No. III were ordered to be de-tagged and\nlisted separately.\n\n5. At the outset, it is to be pointed out that almost all the\nTribunals/High Courts have only relied upon\nRaj Pal\n's case for grant\nof financial upgradation on promotional hierarchy and rejected the\nstand of the Appellant-UOI that under MACP scheme, the employees\nare entitled to financial upgradation of the next grade pay only.\nSince the matter was considered on merits and since the issue\ninvolves impact on the public exchequer and also interest of the staff\nof various establishments, we requested learned Senior Counsel, Mr.\nJaideep Gupta to assist the Court as amicus curiae which the\nlearned Senior Counsel has readily consented. Mr. Kunal Chatterji,\nlearned Counsel has agreed to assist the learned Senior Counsel-\namicus.\"\n\n29. As pointed out earlier, both ACP and MACP Schemes are in the\nnature of incentive schemes devised with the object of ensuring that\nthe employees who are unable to avail of adequate promotional\nopportunities, get some relief from stagnation in the form of financial\nbenefits. Under the MACP Scheme, financial upgradations are\ngranted at three regular intervals on completion of 10-20-30 years of\nservice without promotion. Hence, it is also intended to ensure that\nthe employees are adequately incentivised to work efficiently despite\nnot getting promotion for want of promotional avenue. The change in\npolicy brought about by supersession of the ACP Scheme with the\nMACP Scheme is after well-deliberated and well-documented\nrecommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission. Considering\nthe various issues in the implementation of the ACP Scheme, the Pay\nCommission expressed its views \"the only other way is to bring\nsystematic changes in the existing Scheme of ACP so that all the\nemployees irrespective of the existing hierarchy structure in their\norganisations/cadres, get some benefit under it\". The Commission\ntherefore, recommended that the existing Scheme of ACP be\ncontinued with the modifications indicated thereon in the Report that\nthe financial upgradation has to be in the next immediate Grade\nPay. One of the reasons for the expert body recommending the MACP\nScheme was that there were interdepartmental disparities where\nseveral departments had varying promotional hierarchies. As a\nresult, the working of ACP Scheme under which an employee who\nstagnated for 12 years, was entitled to pay in the Pay Scale of the\nnext promotional post, led to inter-departmental anomalies. The Pay\nCommission therefore, recommended MACP Scheme with a view to\nputting an end to the problem ensuing from inter-departmental\ndisparities.\n\n36.\nIn\nState of Tamil Nadu v. S. Arumugham\n(1998) 2 SCC 198, the\nSupreme Court has observed that the government has the right to\nframe a policy to ensure efficiency and proper administration and to\nprovide to suitable avenues for promotion to officers working in\ndifferent department. The Supreme Court has further observed that\nthe Tribunal cannot substitute its own views for the views of the\ngovernment or direct new policy based on the views of Tribunal.\n\n37. Observing that fixation of pay and determination of\nresponsibilities is a complex matter which is for the executive to take\na decision, the courts should approach such matters with restraint,\nin\nState of Haryana and Anr. v. Haryana Civil Secretariat Personal\nStaff Association\n(2002) 6 SCC 72, the Supreme Court held as under:\n\n10. It is to be kept in mind that the claim of equal pay for equal\nwork is not a fundamental right vested in any employee though\nit is a constitutional goal to be achieved by the Government.\n\nFixation of pay and determination of parity in duties and\nresponsibilities is a complex matter which is for the executive to\ndischarge. While taking a decision in the matter, several\nrelevant factors, some of which have been noted by this Court\nin the decided case, are to be considered keeping in view the\nprevailing financial position and capacity of the State\nGovernment to bear the additional liability of a revised scale of\npay......... That is not to say that the matter is not justiciable or\nthat the courts cannot entertain any proceeding against such\nadministrative decision taken by the Government. The courts\nshould approach such matters with restraint and interfere only\nwhen they are satisfied that the decision of the Government is\npatently irrational, unjust and prejudicial to a Section of\nemployees and the Government while taking the decision has\nignored factors which are material and relevant for a decision\nin the matter. Even in a case where the court holds the order\npassed by the Government to be unsustainable then ordinarily\na direction should be given to the State Government or the\nauthority taking the decision to reconsider the matter and pass\na proper order. The court should avoid giving a declaration\ngranting a particular scale of pay and compelling the\nGovernment to implement the same.\n\n38. The prescription of Pay Scales and incentives are matters where\ndecision is taken by the Government based upon the\nrecommendation of the expert bodies like Pay Commission and\nseveral relevant factors including financial implication and court\ncannot substitute its views. As held in Haryana Civil Secretariat\nPersonal Staff Association (2002) 6 SCC 72, the court should\napproach such matters with restraint and interfere only when the\ncourt is satisfied that the decision of the Government is arbitrary.\nEven in a case where the court takes the view that order/Scheme\npassed by the Government is not an equitable one, ordinarily only a\ndirection could be given to the State Government or the authority for\nconsideration of the matter and take a decision. In the present batch\nof cases where the Respondents are claiming financial upgradation\nin the grade pay of promotional hierarchy, no grounds are made out\nto show that the MACP Scheme granting financial upgradation in the\nnext grade pay is arbitrary and unjust; warranting interference. The\nimplementation of the MACP Scheme is claimed to have led to certain\nanomalies; but as pointed out earlier, MACP Scheme itself is not\nunder challenge.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n56. The ACP Scheme which is now superseded by MACP Scheme is\na matter of government policy. Interference with the\nrecommendations of the expert body like Pay Commission and its\nrecommendations for the MACP, would have serious impact on the\npublic exchequer. The recommendations of the Pay Commission for\nMACP Scheme has been accepted by the Government and\nimplemented. There is nothing to show that the Scheme is arbitrary\nor unjust warranting interference. Without considering the\nadvantages in the MACP Scheme, the High Courts erred in\ninterfering with the government's policy in accepting the\nrecommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission by simply\nplacing reliance upon\nRaj Pal\n's case. The impugned orders cannot be\nsustained and are liable to be set aside\"\n\n11. The learned Advocate General in advancing his submission has\n\nemphasised that the State is entitled to discontinue its policy of granting\n\nincentive at any time and no one can claim any vested right to such\nincentive, as observed in Vice Chairman Delhi Development Authority v.\n\nNarender Kumar and Ors., reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 273. It is\n\nsubmitted that similar argument of extension of similar benefits irrespective\n\nof discontinuation of MACP scheme or SEP benefit have been turned down\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Narendra Kuman (supra).\n\n12. Our attention is drawn to paragraphs 31, 32, 33 and 34 of the\n\nsaid judgment, which read:\n\n\"31.This brings the court to the next point, which is whether the\nemployees can assert what is termed as a vested right. The\nfirst submission in this regard is that according to Para 9 of the\nMACP scheme, those who are in employment on the date when\nMACP scheme was brought into force and who are entitled to\nthe ACP benefits, especially the second financial up-gradation\nhad a right to insist that their second up-gradation should be\ngranted in terms of the ACP scheme. In this context, the\nargument advanced is that Rule 9 preserves and protects such\na right (for entitlement) to be granted the ACP benefits even\nafter the introduction of the MACP scheme.\n\n32. Para 9 recognises the fact that if there is any ambiguity in\nthe interpretation of the MACP scheme it would be resolved by\nthe Department of Personnel and Training. It also clarifies in the\nlast sentence that financial up-gradation would be granted till\n31.08.2008 (given that the MACP scheme itself became\noperative on 01.09.2008), although the office memorandum was\nissued on 19.05.2009. In the opinion of this Court the undue\ninfluence placed upon the last sentence cannot be met much of\nby the employees given that the ACP scheme itself ended on\n31.08.2008. This provision (i.e. Para 9) was made to cater to\nthe situations where the grant of ACP benefits was under\nprocess, this would mean both types of benefits i.e. the first\nand the second up-gradation. Doubtlessly, the first up-\ngradation under the ACP scheme was to be granted after 12\nyears. If Para 9 were to be considered in the context of the first\nup-gradation it is a clarification to the effect that the individual\nconcerned who has crossed 12 years' service (and therefore\nbecame eligible and whose case is under active consideration)\nwould get the ACP benefits. However, this provision cannot be\nunderstood as an independent transitional provision, enabling\nall employees awaiting the up-gradation to insist that the\nbenefit of the ACP scheme should indefinitely continue despite\nits ceasing to exist after 31.08.2008.\n\n33. The second aspect in this regard is the argument that a\nvested right accrued in favour of the employees who had\ncompleted the eligibility for a financial up-gradation to insist\nthat such up-gradation ought to be only under the ACP scheme\nand not under the MACP scheme.\n\n34. The concept of \"vested right\" has arisen for consideration\nbefore this Court in several contexts especially with respect to\nalteration of service condition of public employees. That the\nCentral Government in the exercise of its legislative powers\nconferred under provision of\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution can\nframe Rules which has the force of law has been settled several\ndecades ago. This Court has also held that such Rules can be\nmade to operate from anterior date by giving retrospective effect\nto them. The determination of an anterior date for the operation\nof a Rule which has the effect of nullifying or refacing\nintervening events or invalidating benefits which had been\ngranted to public employees was held to be unconstitutional in\n\nState of Gujarat v. Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni\n(1983) 2 SCR\n287. Several previous judgments of this Court dealing with the\nquestion that what is accrued or vested right were considered\nin\nChairman, Railway Board v. C.R. Rangadhamaiah\nSupp (3) SCR 63 wherein the impugned Rule in question sought\nto disturb the method of calculating the last pay drawn for the\npurposes of pension and related allowances. This impacted the\npension disbursement of a large number of employees who had\nretired much earlier. The court observed that the amendments\napplied to employees who had already retired and were no\nlonger in service on the date the impugned notifications were\nissued, and adversely impacted the pension they were\ndrawing. In such context the court held as impermissible, those\nbenefits which accrued or in other words had been actually\nenjoyed and were taken away by the devise of giving\nretrospective effect to the rule. The court observed as follows:\n\n22.\nIn\nState of Gujarat v. Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni\n(1983)\n2 SCC 33] decided by a Constitution Bench of the Court, the\nquestion was whether the status of ex-ministerial employees\nwho had been allocated to the Panchayat service as\nSecretaries, Officers and Servants of Gram and Nagar\nPanchayats under the\nGujarat Panchayat Act, 1961\nas\ngovernment servants could be extinguished by making\nretrospective amendment of the said Act in 1978. Striking\ndown the said amendment on the ground that it offended\n\nArticles 311\nand\nof the Constitution, this Court said:\n\n52. ... The legislature is undoubtedly competent to legislate\nwith retrospective effect to take away or impair any vested\nright acquired under existing laws but since the laws are\nmade under a written Constitution, and have to conform to\nthe do's and don'ts of the Constitution, neither prospective\nnor retrospective laws can be made so as to contravene\nFundamental Rights. The law must satisfy the\nrequirements of the Constitution today taking into account\nthe accrued or acquired rights of the parties today. The\nlaw cannot say, twenty years ago the parties had no\nrights, therefore, the requirements of the Constitution will\nbe satisfied if the law is dated back by twenty years. We\nare concerned with today's rights and not yesterday's. A\nlegislature cannot legislate today with reference to a\nsituation that obtained twenty years ago and ignore the\nmarch of events and the constitutional rights accrued in\nthe course of the twenty years. That would be most\narbitrary, unreasonable and a negation of history.\n\n23. The said decision in Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni (1983) 2\nSCR 287 of the Constitution Bench of this Court has been\nfollowed by various Division Benches of this Court. (\nK.C. Arora\nv. State of Haryana\n(1984) 3 SCR 623;\nT.R. Kapur v. State of\nHaryana\n(1987) 1 SCR 584];\nP.D. Aggarwal v. State of U.P.\n\n(1987) 3 SCR 427];\nK. Narayanan v. State of Karnataka\nSupp (1) SCC 44];\nUnion of India v. Tushar Ranjan Mohanty\n\n(1994) 5 SCC 450] and K. Ravindranath Pai v. State of\nKarnataka 1995 Supp (2) SCC 246).\n\n24. In many of these decisions the expressions \"vested rights\"\n\nor \"accrued rights\" have been used while striking down the\nimpugned provisions which had been given retrospective\noperation so as to have an adverse effect in the matter of\npromotion, seniority, substantive appointment, etc., of the\nemployees. The said expressions have been used in the context\nof a right flowing under the relevant Rule which was sought to\nbe altered with effect from an anterior date and thereby taking\naway the benefits available under the Rule in force at that time.\nIt has been held that such an amendment having retrospective\noperation which has the effect of taking away a benefit already\navailable to the employee under the existing Rule is arbitrary,\ndiscriminatory and violative of the rights guaranteed Under\n\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. We are unable to hold\nthat these decisions are not in consonance with the decisions in\nRoshan Lal Tandon (1968) 1 SCR 185] B.S. Vadera (1968) 3\nSCR 575] and Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni (1983) 2 SCR 287].\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n13. It is submitted that they may have an expectation of their case\n\nbeing considered for higher scale of pay upon acquiring higher degree but it\n\ncannot crystalise into a right enforceable in law. The ROPA rules have\n\nundergone changes over a period of time based on experience and other\n\nfactors and the necessity to enact the 1997 Act and 2005 Act would clearly\n\njustify that unless a higher qualification is acquired with prior permission,\n\nthe teachers enjoying benefits of higher scale of pay prior to the introduction\n\nof the said two Acts would not acquire a vested right and cannot insist for\n\ncontinuation of such higher scale of pay based on higher qualification.\n\n14. Our attention is drawn to the views expressed by a coordinate\n\nbench in\nPradip Kumar Karak and Ors. v. The State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs.\n, reported in 2018 (4) CHN 131 paragraph 112 in particular in support\n\nof the contention that the present petitioner cannot claim any vested right\n\nupon acquiring higher qualification after the Act and the relevant rules\n\noperating in the field came into force. Paragraphs 112 and 140-142 relied in\n\nthis regard are reproduced below:\n\" 112. It is clear therefore, that the Writ Petitioners/Appellants\nNo. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21 and 22\nacquired their higher qualifications after the benefit granted to\nrural librarians by the Memorandum Beta dated March 7, 1990\nhad been taken away, and substituted by way of amendment\nby Memorandum Gamma dated July 21, 1990 by another\nsentence in paragraph 16(3) of the said Memorandum dated\nMarch 7, 1990 which made it clear that where necessary\nseparate orders would be issued. Since all these writ\npetitioners/Appellants acquired their higher qualifications after\nJuly 21, 1990, when the said amendment had already taken\nplace, they had no vested right which was being affected. By\nthe time they had acquired their higher qualification, there was\nno statutory rule as would allow them to claim the benefit\nautomatically. If there is no rule allowing something to be done,\nbut in fact a deliberate \"amending out\" of a previously extant\nrule which had allowed it to be done, then it is to be necessarily\ninferred that the State of West Bengal in its wisdom did not\nwant that \"something\" to be done. There was, therefore, no\nlegal right inhering in the said writ petitioners/Appellants to\nclaim a higher scale of pay. It is to be noted that they did not\nseek that on introduction of the amendment by Memorandum\ngamma dated July 21, 1990.\n\n140. Those librarians who acquired higher qualifications after\nJuly 21, 1990 had no legal right to move the writ court for\nenforcement of the terms of un-amended paragraph 16(3) of\nmemorandum dated March 7, 1990. The benefit that was\nconferred thereby was plainly not there when they moved the\nwrit court. Rightly so, it is proposed by my learned brother that\nsuch of the appellants who acquired higher qualifications after\nthe cut-off date i.e. July 21, 1990, are not entitled to the benefit\nof higher pay and I fully agree with His Lordship that the\nappeal at their instance ought to be dismissed.\n\n141. At this stage, it is also considered appropriate to record\nmy agreement with the views expressed by my learned brother\nthat neither is the decision in Shibnath Koley (supra) a\njudgment in rem nor are the librarians who have acquired\nhigher qualifications after the cut-off date entitled to any benefit\nflowing from memorandum dated June 10, 2014, as interpreted\nin the order of the learned Judge dated June 9, 2016 while\ndisposing of a batch of writ petitions with W.P. 7150(W) of 2015\nbeing the lead case. With utmost respect to the learned Judge\nwho decided W.P. 7150(W) of 2015, the memorandum dated\nJune 10, 2014 [which allowed benefits of better pay to the\nlibrarian respondents in Shibnath Koley (supra)] was misread\nand, therefore, cannot be of any persuasive value.\nInsofar as\nthe decision of the coordinate Bench dated January 4, 2017 in\n\nState of West Bengal v. Rafique Sekh\n(of which I was a\nmember) is concerned, the appeal of the State was dismissed\nnot because the aforesaid decision dated June 9, 2016 in W.P.\n7150(W) of 2015 had been found to be legal but on the premise\nthat the State not having challenged such decision in an\nappropriate proceeding, the same had attained finality and\nfurther orders on the administrative side could not have been\npassed contrary to such final and binding decision.\n\n142. However, those librarians who have acquired higher\nqualifications before the cut-off date of July 21, 1990 are\nentitled to claim that they be treated at par with the librarians\n(Shibnath Koley & others) who were before the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court as respondents in Civil Appeal Nos. 6967-6970\nof 2009. In fact, the State in its counter-affidavit before the\nHon'ble Supreme Court was also candid in its stance that at\nleast some of the appellants were entitled to better pay based\non higher qualifications without, however, identifying them. In\nmy opinion, the issue as to whether the librarians who had\nacquired higher qualifications before the cut-off date i.e. July\n21, 1990 is no longer res integra in view of the decision of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Shibnath Koley (supra).\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n15. Mr. Advocate General has relied upon the Division Bench\n\nJudgment of Karnataka High Court namely\nK. Narayana v. State of\n\nKarnataka\nreported in ILR 1991 KAR 3283 that reiterated the same\n\nprinciples that incentive cannot be elevated to the status of a vested right.\n\n16. In answering question (b) the learned Advocate General has\n\nargued that:\n\na. The omission or absence of any rule granting of a higher pay scale\nhas no nexus and relation to, and does not in any manner create,\nan embargo upon an individual's freedom and right to acquire\nhigher educational qualification(s).\n\nb.\nSections 14\nand\nof The West Bengal Schools (Control of\nExpenditure) Act, 2005 ('2005 Act') do not in any manner seek to\ninterfere with the right or freedom of an individual freedom to\nacquire a higher qualification.\n\nc.\nSection 14\nand\nof the 2005 Act provide as follows:\n\n\"14(1). Every teacher of a school shall, if appointed in the post of\nUndergraduate teacher category be entitled to draw pay in the\nscale of pay in which he is appointed and shall not be entitled to\nclaim any additional increment or higher scale of pay for\nacquiring any qualification other than the qualifications\nspecified for such post.\n\n(2) Every teacher of a school shall, if appointed in the post of\ngraduate teacher category, be entitled to draw pay in the scale\nof pay in which he is appointed and shall not be entitled to\nclaim any additional increment or higher scale of pay for\nacquiring any qualification other than the qualifications\nspecified for such post.\n\n(3) Every teacher of a school shall, if appointed in the Honours\nGraduate or Postgraduate teacher category, be entitled to draw\npay of Post-graduate teacher category, upon acquiring Post-\n\ngraduate degree, in the manner as may be specified by order.\"\n\n\"20. The provisions of this Act or any rules or orders made\nthereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary contained in any other law for the time being in force\nor in any contract, custom or usages to the contrary.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\nSection 14\nof the Act only relates to the entitlement of an individual to\na higher pay scale. It is submitted that neither\nsection 14\nnor\nsection\nrelate to or affect the freedom of an individual to acquire a higher\nqualification.\n\nd. The decision in\nTarak Chandra Roy v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n\ndecided on 17th January, 2008, does not relate to nor does in any\nmanner seek to create embargo upon an individual's freedom and\nright to acquire higher educational qualification. The question\ninvolved\nin that case\nwas as follows:\n\n\"After the School Service Commission Act, 1997 came into force,\nwould the appointees get benefit of higher scale of pay despite\nbeing interviewed and selected in \"Pass category\".\ne. Furthermore, it is not the contention in any of the writ petitions\nbefore this Court that an embargo has been created upon an\nindividual's freedom or right to acquire higher educational\nqualification(s).\n\nf. A freedom or right to acquire a higher qualification does not\nautomatically result in an entitlement to a higher pay scale in the\nabsence of any law providing for the same.\n\ng. In any event, there is no fundamental right to acquire higher\neducation.\nArticle 45\nof the Constitution, before the\nConstitution\n(Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002\n, provided that the State shall\nendeavour to provide free and compulsory education for all\nchildren up to 14 years of age, within 10 years from the\ncommencement of the Constitution.\nIn the case of\nUnni Krishnan,\nJ.P. v. State of A.P.\n, reported at (1993) 1 SCC 645, it was noticed\nthat 10 years had long gone by, and no provision was made\nimposing an obligation upon the State to ensure the right to free\neducation of every child upto the age of 14 years.\nArticle 21-A\nof\nthe Constitution was inserted by the\nConstitution (Eighty-sixth\nAmendment) Act, 2002\n, which recognized the right to free and\ncompulsory education for all children only of the age 6-14 years.\nHigher education has not been recognized as a fundamental right\nunder Part III of the Constitution.\n\n17. In answering question (c) the learned Advocate General has\n\nargued that:\n\nFirstly, this question cannot arise at all for consideration since\n\nneither the answer to question (a) is in the negative, nor the\n\nanswer to question (b) is in the affirmative.\nSecondly, there was no challenge to the vires of\nsections 14\nand\nof the 2005 Act in any of the writ petitions before the court in\n\nwhich the order of reference dated 22nd August, 2008 has been\n\npassed.\n\nThirdly, there was also no challenge to the vires of\nSection 14\nand\nof the 2005 Act before the court in the case of\nTarak Chandra\n\nRoy v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\ndecided on 17th January,\n\n2008, or in the case of\nThe State of West Bengal v. Sauvik\n\nGhosh & Ors.\n, decided on 8th April, 2008.\n\n18. In the writ petitions before this bench, a challenge to the vires of\n\nSection 14\nof the 2005 Act has only been made in WP 9921(w) of 2007 on\n\nthe ground that it would render the order dated 22nd September, 2004\n\npassed by a learned Single Judge of this Court otiose.\n\n19. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that in any event and\n\nwithout prejudice to the above,\nSections 14\nand\nof the 2005 Act cannot\n\nbe said to be ultra vires\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n20. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that a law can be\n\nchallenged only on the following four grounds:\n\ni. It is beyond the competence of the Legislature;\n\nii. It violates\nArticle 13\nof the Constitution;\n\niii. It is enacted contrary to a prohibition in the Constitution;\n\nand\niv. It is enacted without following the procedure\nlaid down in\n\nthe Constitution.\n\nIn this regard he has relied upon the decision in Supreme\n\nCourt Advocates on\nRecord Association v. Union of India\n\nreported at (2016) 5 SCC 1, Paras 852-857 at pages 642-644\n\nof the Report.\n\n21. These grounds have not been taken in any of the writ petitions\n\nbefore this court to challenge\nsections 14\nand\nof the 2005 Act.\n\n22. The competence of the Legislature to enact the 2005 Act is not\n\nin dispute.\n\n23. The attention of the court is drawn to the statement of Objects\n\nand Reasons of the 2005 Act which states as follows:\n\n\"1. The matters relating to creation of posts, approval of panels,\nappointment of teachers, regularisation of services of teaching\nand non-teaching staff, sanction of higher scale to teachers on\naccount of acquiring higher qualifications of teachers, in the\nschool and the Madrashas in the State of West Bengal, and\nrecognition and upgradation, and expenditure for management,\nof such schools and Madrasahs, are presently governed, inter\nalia, by the administrative orders, directions and circulars\nissued from time to time by the School Education Department.\n\n2. As such, administrative orders, directions and circulars do\nnot have any statutory base, it has been experience, with the\npassage of time, that they are often challenged in the Courts of\nlaw, causing huge financial burden on the State Exchequer.\n3. It has therefore been felt necessary and expedient to frame a\nseparate statute for streamlining the management of schools\nand Madrasahs in the State of West Bengal and for regulating\nand controlling the expenditure to be incurred out of the\nappropriate Budgetary provisions.\n\n4. The Bill has been framed with the above objects in view.\n\n5. No additional expenditure is envisaged to give effect to the\nprovisions of the Bill\". (emphasis supplied)\n\n24. It is submitted that the Preamble to the 2005 Act clearly\n\ndefines its purpose as it states:\n\n\"\nAn Act\nto provide for the control of expenditure in the\nSchools in West Bengal''\n\n25. The State has consciously decided to grant incentives of higher\n\npay scale for obtaining higher qualification only after taking into\n\nconsideration the financial implication of granting such incentives on the\n\nState exchequer. The State is entitled to discontinue its policy to grant such\n\nincentives at any time and the continued grant of incentives cannot be\n\nclaimed as a matter of right.\n\n26. The grant of incentives at an earlier point of time does not\n\ncreate any vested right in favour of a person to be continued to be granted\n\nsuch incentives. Therefore, there cannot be said to be any discrimination\n\nbetween the persons who have received such incentives under a previous\n\npolicy of the State and persons covered under a later policy of the State. As\n\na result, the challenge on the basis of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution\n\ndoes not lie.\n27. There is no fundamental right recognised under part III of the\n\nConstitution permitting automatic grant of a higher pay scale upon\n\nobtaining a higher educational qualification.\n\n28. There is no prohibition in the Constitution preventing the State\n\nfrom enacting\nsections 14\nand\nof the 2005 Act nor has any prohibition\n\nbeen indicted to the court in any of the writ petitioners.\n\n29. Furthermore, there is no allegation that the 2005 Act has been\n\nenacted without following the procedure\nlaid down in\nthe Constitution.\n\n30.\nSection 14\nof the 2005 Act permits regulating and controlling\n\nexpenditure to be incurred out of appropriate budgetary provisions. This is\n\nwithin the domain of the state legislature and/or state policy.\n\n31.\nIn so far as the grounds taken in WP 9921(w) of 2007, (\nUtpal\n\nKanti Karan v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n), is concerned it is argued\n\nthat none of the grounds could form the basis of a challenge of a law made\n\nby the legislature as recognised in the decision of Supreme Court\n\nAdvocates on\nRecord Association\n(supra). It is always open to the\n\nlegislature to change the law provided it possesses the necessary legislative\n\ncompetence. In this case there is no dispute as to the legislative competence\n\nto enact the 2005 Act.\n\n32. In answering question (d) the learned Advocate General has\n\nargued that it would be necessary to refer to the evolution of law in this\nregard since promulgation of ROPA 1990 on March 7, 1990 till promulgation\n\nof Government order no.593 dated 27th November, 2007.\n\n33. It is submitted that the different ROPA Rules between the\n\naforesaid period read with the\nWest Bengal School Service Commission Act,\nand\nWest Bengal School (Control and Expenditure) Act, 2005\nwould\n\nshow that the higher scale of pay is linked to the higher qualifications and\n\nhedged with certain conditions like prior permission of District Inspector of\n\nschools concerned. A teacher joining the service as a pass graduate cannot\n\nclaim higher scale of pay on acquiring higher qualification unless the staff\n\npattern permits and with the prior permission in respect of relevant subject.\n\nMr. Advocate General has taken us through ROPA Rules since 1970 till\n\n2009 and the relevant provisions of the\nWest Bengal School Service\n\nCommission Act\n1997 as well as the West Bengal School (Control and\n\nExpenditure) Rule, 2005. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that the\n\nRules for Revision of Pay and Allowances (ROPA 1970) was first published\n\non and from 1st March, 1971 on the recommendation of the first pay\n\ncommission. Thereafter by a Government order no. 60 issued on 15th\n\nJanuary, 1972 with effect from 1st February, 1972 a change was introduced\n\nwith regard to prescribing scale of pay on the basis of academic\n\nqualifications as it was noticed that the aforesaid system introduced with\n\nthe object of engaging teachers to meet their qualifications with a view to\n\nbring out a qualitative improvement in the standard of teaching in\n\nsecondary school did not actually work to the benefit of the institution or the\n\nstudents for the additional expenditure incurred towards higher scale of pay\nto the teachers. On reconsideration while giving incentive to the teachers to\n\nimprove their qualification, the criterion of teaching staff pattern in\n\nsecondary and higher secondary school was introduced with the norms\n\nbeing\nlaid down in\nthis regard. It stipulates that for junior sections, no\n\nteacher with Honours degree would be approved and even if a teacher\n\nsubsequently acquires higher qualification, he/she would be treated as a\n\n\"pass graduate\" for the purpose of financial benefits and for senior sections,\n\nif any existing teacher subsequently improves his qualification, he would be\n\ntreated as a \"pass graduate\" for the purpose of financial benefits until he is\n\nabsorbed in a suitable vacancy within the overall sanctioned strength.\n\n34. Thereafter on 8th July, 1974 State Government issued an order\n\nno. 772 prescribing revised pattern of teaching staff. On 31st July, 1991\n\nfollowing the recommendation of 2nd Pay Commission ROPA 1981 was\n\npublished. Certain qualification to ROPA 1981 was issued by Government\n\nOrder no.59 dated 16th January, 1992 which, inter alia, provided that\n\nexisting teachers who wish to improve their qualifications relevant to their\n\nteaching subjects (subject relevant would mean the subject in which the\n\nteacher was appointed) may do so on receipt of prior permission only\n\nrelevant to their teaching subject from directorate/employer. This\n\nqualification has introduced the requirement of \"prior permission only\n\nrelevant to the teaching subject of the teacher\" from directorate/employer.\n\nThe position of the teachers vis-a-vis their higher qualification being linked\n\nto higher scale of pay has undergone a sea change with the introduction of\n\nROPA 1990 as per the recommendation of 3rd Pay Commission. These rules\nwere given retrospective effect from 1st January, 1986 with actual payment\n\ntill 1998.\n\n35. Mr. Advocate General has relied upon rule 16 of ROPA 1990\n\nwhich refers to \"career advancement scheme\" and related issues Specific\n\nattention was drawn to Rule 16(3) which refers to improvement of\n\nqualifications by the teachers in subject or group relevant to their teaching.\n\nRule 16(3) reads as follows:\n\n\"16. Career advancement Scheme and related issues:\n\n(3) All teachers and librarians of secondary schools \"who have\nimproved/will improve their qualification or who were\nappointed with higher qualification in subject or group\nrelevant to their teaching/appointment shall get higher scale\nof pay appropriate to their qualifications, with effect from the\n1st January, 1986 or the date of improving qualification\nwhichever is later.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n36. Mr. Advocate General submits that the aforesaid rule\n\ncontemplates teachers who have already improved their qualifications or\n\nwould improve their qualifications or who were appointed with higher\n\nqualifications in subject or group relevant to their teaching/appointment to\n\nget higher scale of pay with effect from 1st January 1986 or the date of\n\nimproving qualifications which is later. It would thus benefit three\n\ncategories of teachers. Similar benefit was extended by the Government\n\norder no. 795 dated 22nd November, 1993 with regard to physical education\n\nteacher having higher qualification of Master Degree who were not being\n\ngranted higher scale of pay presumably due to absence of any provision for\npost graduate physical education teachers in the staff pattern\nlaid down in\n\ngovernment order dated 8th July, 1974. The physical education teacher\n\nhaving master degree henceforth would be entitled to get higher scale of pay\n\nin relaxation to the aforesaid staff pattern. By a government Order 796\n\ndated 22nd November 1993 noticing that teachers having higher qualification\n\nin the relevant subject were not being granted higher scale of pay\n\npresumably due to lack of suitable provisions for teachers in social science\n\ngroup, language group and science group in terms of government order\n\ndated 8th July, 1974 and 15th January 1972 it was clarified that in view of\n\nthe memos dated 31st July, 1981 and 7th March, 1990 all such teachers with\n\nhigher qualification of post graduate degree or equivalent in the relevant\n\nsubject will be entitled to get higher scale of pay in relaxation to the\n\naforesaid staff pattern. A government Order no. 417 dated 8th March, 2000\n\nas a clarification to Government Order No. 795 dated 22nd November, 1993\n\nwas issued to extend the benefit of higher scale of pay would be admissible\n\nto only those Physical Education teachers who obtained their master degree\n\non completion of two years regular course from a recognised university. The\n\ngovernment noticing that teachers who have obtained higher qualification in\n\nsubjects not relevant to their respective subject in which they were\n\nappointed but relevant to their respective teaching subjects issued a\n\nGovernment Order no. 57 dated 27th January, 1995, granting higher scale\n\nof pay. However, prior permission of the District inspector of Schools would\n\nbe required when taking classes not relevant to their respective subject.\n37. Thereafter the West Bengal School Service Commission Act,\n\n1997 came into force on and from 1st July, 1997.\n\n38. The learned Advocate General has referred to\nSections 7\n,\n,\nand\nof the said Act.\n\n39. It is submitted that\nSection 7\ncontains a non-obstante clause\n\nand it requires the Regional Commission to select persons for appointment\n\nto the post of teachers in schools. The manner and scope of appointment are\n\nindicated in\nSection 8\n.\nSection 9\ncontains a non-obstante clause and it\n\nprovides that appointments to the post of teachers in a school shall be made\n\non the recommendation of the Regional Commission having jurisdiction. The\n\nterms and conditions of the service of teachers in employment before the\n\ncommencement of the 1997 Act are protected under\nSection 10\nas it\n\nrestricts the authorities not to vary such terms to their disadvantages.\n\n40. The Government Order no.548 dated 24th June, 1997 requires\n\nall the teachers who desire to enrol for examination conducted through\n\ncorrespondence/distance mode of education from UGC affiliated Universities\n\nto take prior permission from the District Inspector of Schools (SC) through\n\nManaging committee and/or ad hoc committee and/or administrator. The\n\nManaging Committee while sending the case for approval, would have to\n\ninclude their comments regarding relevance of the subject of higher studies\n\nand also whether such higher studies are likely to affect the duties of the\n\nteacher in the school.\n41. On 1st November, 1997 the West Bengal School Service\n\nCommission Rules 1997 (thereafter referred to as \"1997 Rules\") was\n\npromulgated vide notification dated 3rd October, 1997 published in the\n\ngovernment Gazette on 1st November, 1997. Our attention is drawn to Rule\n\n7 of the 1997 Rules which provides that the State Government in the School\n\nEducation Department would lay down the procedure for recruitment of\n\nteachers. This was followed by a notification dated 8th January, 1998\n\npublished in the Calcutta Gazette on 15th January, 1998 that laid down a\n\nprocedure for selection of recruitment of teachers as envisaged in Rule 7 of\n\n1997 Rules. The qualification prescribed for Assistant Teachers in physical\n\neducation was a Bachelor's degree.\n\n42. The manner of distribution of staff in different groups in schools\n\nwas\nlaid down in\nGovernment Order no. 670 dated 4th September, 1998.\n\n43. Mr. Advocate General submits that the Rules for Revision of Pay\n\nand Allowances (ROPA 1998) was issued on 12th February, 1999 as per the\n\nrecommendation of the Pay Commission with effect from 1st January, 1996\n\nwith actual payment from 1st April, 1997. The said Rules are to be\n\nconsidered along with the Government orders issued between 12th\n\nFebruary, 1999 and 13th May, 2005 with a view to appreciate the claim for\n\nhigher scale of pay by a teacher.\n\n44. Our attention is drawn to Rule 12(3) of the ROPA 1998. It\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n\"12. Career Advancement Scheme and related issues:\n(3) All teachers including physical Education teachers and\nlibrarians of Secondary Schools who have improved/will improve\ntheir qualifications who were appointed with higher qualification in\nthe subjects or groups relevant to their teaching/appointment\nshall get higher scale of pay appropriate to their qualifications,\nwith effect from the 1st January, 1996 or the date of improving\nqualifications whichever is later.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n45. Subsequently by a memorandum dated 12th February, 1999\n\nROPA 1998 was amended by adding a proviso to rule 12(3):\n\nRule 12(3) as amended provided as follows:\n\n\"3. All teachers including physical Education teachers and\nlibrarians of Secondary Schools who have improved/will improve\ntheir qualifications or who were appointed with higher qualification\nin the subjects or groups relevant to their teaching/appointment\nshall get higher scale of pay appropriate to their qualifications,\nwith effect from the 1st January, 1996 or the date of improving\nqualifications whichever is later, provided that such higher\nqualified teachers in the relevant subjects or group is justified as\nper approved staff pattern of that school. If such teacher is\nappointed through West Bengal School Service Commission,\nhis/her pay will be fixed in the scale of pay as per his/her\nqualification mentioned by the West Bengal School Service\nCommission\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n46. The Government Order no. 795 dated 22nd November 1993 was\n\nclarified by the Government Order no. 417 issued on 8th March 2000, in\n\nwhich, it was stated that the benefit of higher scale of pay would be\n\nadmissible to only those physical education teachers who obtained their\n\nMasters degree on completion of 2 years regular course from a Recognised\nUniversity. This order was to take effect from the date of its issuance i.e. 8th\n\nMarch, 2000.\n\n47. On 3rd June, 2002, Rule 12(3) was further amended by\n\ngovernment Order no. 735 dated 3rd June, 2002. After amendment, all\n\nHonours Graduate teachers appointed through the WBSSC who have\n\nobtained Post Graduate degree in the subject relevant to their appointments\n\nprior to their date of joining in the school or who have completed their\n\nstudies at the post graduate level in the subject relevant to their\n\nappointment or have appeared at the examination but the result was not\n\npublished till the date of joining may be allowed higher scale of pay with\n\neffect from the date of joining or the date following the last date of\n\nexamination, whichever is later.\n\n48. This was in view of the fact that Honours Graduate candidates\n\nhave to compete with post graduate candidate in the test held by WBSSC\n\nand a single panel is prepared by WBSSC for the two sets of degree holders.\n\n49. The position of the teacher appointed after enactment of West\n\nBengal School (Control of Expenditure) Act 2005 would be governed by the\n\nprovision of the Act and the Government orders and memoranda issued\n\nbetween 19th August, 2005 and 27th February, 2009. The 2005 Act came\n\ninto effect from 19th August, 2005.\n\n50. On 20th January, 2005 the West Bengal Board of Secondary\n\nEducation (Conduct and Discipline of Teachers and Non-Teaching staff)\n\nRegulations 2004 (in short, \"2004 Rules\") was promulgated. Under Rule 25\nevery teacher is required to submit an application for appearing in any\n\nexamination through the appointing authority and with the approval of the\n\ncommittee.\n\n51. The said Rule was further amended on 30th May, 2005 to\n\nprovide that every teacher shall submit an application for appearing in any\n\nexamination to the appointing authority and seek prior approval of the\n\nDistrict Inspector of School if there is any financial involvement. The\n\namendment would clearly show that the teacher concerned would be\n\nrequired to seek prior approval of the District Inspector of School in the\n\nevent it entails any financial implication. The position of the teachers\n\nappointed after enactment of West Bengal School (Control and Expenditure)\n\nAct 2005 was explained by referring to the 2005 Act and various government\n\ncirculars issued thereunder till 22nd November, 2007.\n\n52. Mr. Advocate General has referred to\nSections 4\n,\n,\nand\nof the said Act and submits that by reason of\nSection 4\nschool authorities\n\ncannot create any teaching or non-teaching post involving any financial\n\nliability on the state exchequer, without previous sanction of the State\n\nGovernment and grant any special pay or allowance or any other benefit\n\nhaving financial implication to any person holding teaching or non teaching\n\npost.\n\n53. In terms of\nSection 14\nof the Act no additional increment of\n\nhigher scale of pay could be granted for acquiring any qualification other\n\nthan the qualification specified for the post and that a teacher if appointed\nin Honours Graduate or Post Graduate category shall be entitled to draw\n\npay of Post Graduate category upon acquiring Post Graduate degree as may\n\nbe specified.\n\n54. Under\nSection 16\nof the Act the terms and conditions of the\n\nservice of teachers in employment before the commencement of the 2005 Act\n\nshall not be varied to their disadvantage.\n\n55.\nSection 20\nof the Act provides that the 2005 Act along with\n\nrules and orders would have overriding effect over any other law in conflict\n\nwith the provisions of this Act.\n\n56. On 26th December, 2005 government Order no. 1595 was\n\nissued under\nSection 14(3)\nof the 2005 Act, specifying the manner in which\n\na teacher of a school if appointed in Honours graduate or post graduate\n\ncategory would be entitled to draw \"pay of post graduate category\" upon\n\n\"acquiring post graduate degree\".\n\n57. The aforesaid government order stipulates that for improvement\n\nof qualification after joining the post prior permission of the competent\n\nauthority would be required.\n\n58. Subsequently, Memorandum no. 151 was issued on 12th May,\n\n2006 to sanction \"Protection of Pay\" to those teachers whose pay had been\n\nfixed at a lower stage than their contemporary/junior teaching staff who\n\nwere in receipt of higher pay before the benefit of CAS was granted to the\n\nlatter.\n59. Our attention is drawn to Government Order no. 593 issued on\n\n27th November, 2007 under\nSection 14(3)\nof the 2005 Act replacing all\n\nearlier circulars and modifying Government Order No. 1595 dated 26th\n\nDecember, 2005. It provided, inter alia:\n\n(i) All Teachers required to seek prior permission of the Managing\n\nCommittee/Head of Committee/Administrator, to enrol for any\n\nexamination for enhancement of qualification.(Clause 1)\n\n(ii) Teachers required to seek prior permission of the District\n\nInspector of Schools (SE), if he/she wishes to claim higher scale\n\nof pay for obtaining higher qualification through Management\n\nCommittee of the School. (Clause 3)\n\n(iii) No permission to be granted to any teacher who entered the\n\nservice with graduate degree and graduate scale of pay.(Clause\n\n4)\n\n(iv) The courses to be studied should be \"relevant to the subjects\n\nalready studied\". (Clause 5)\n\n60. It is submitted that prayers from teachers who had already\n\nsecured higher qualification prior to the 2005 Act for higher scale of pay\n\nmay be considered only by the District Inspector of Schools (SE), with\n\napproval of Director of School Education after examining staff pattern. In\n\nterms of Clause 6 and 7 of the above government order dated 27th\n\nNovember, 2007 no such prayer would be entertained from any teacher with\ngraduate degree and graduate scale of pay at the time of entry into service\n\nirrespective of whether the higher qualification was secured before or after\n\nthe 2005 Act.\n\n61. For the purpose of completeness it is submitted that on 27th\n\nFebruary, 2009 a memorandum containing the Rules for Revision of Pay and\n\nAllowances ('ROPA 2009') was issued as per the recommendation of the Pay\n\nCommission. The Rules were to take effect from 1st January, 2006 with\n\nactual payment from 1st April, 2008. The 2005 Act was further amended on\n\n2nd February, 2017.\n\n62. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that as the relevant rules\n\nprior to 2005 Act or the vires of the 2005 Act was not under challenge and\n\nhaving regard to the fact that the relevant government orders both prior to\n\n1997 Act and subsequent thereto emphasise that the appointment to the\n\npost is the deciding factor with regard to scale of pay the decision in\nTarak\n\nChandra Roy\n(supra) requires approval.\n\n63. Mr. Advocate General in answer to the questions referred to this\n\nSpecial Bench by order dated 6th September, 2019 has referred to Rule 12(5)\n\nof the ROPA 1998 which came into force on and from 1st January, 1996.\n\nThe said Rule provides as follows:\n\n\"12(5) Secondary teachers Headmasters/Headmistresses with\nDoctorate degree in the subject taught or in an allied subject shall\nget two additional increments from the date of the convocation of\nwhich such degree is awarded.\nProvided that those who obtained this degree prior to the date of\ncoming over to the revised scale shall get two additional\nincrements from the date with effect from which they elect to draw\npay in the revised scales, provided that they have not already got\nsuch additional increments in the earlier pay revision and\nprovided further that in the latter case, pay should be fixed at\nleast at the third stage of the relevant scale of pay.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n64. Mr. Advocate General submitted that the said rule\n\nunmistakably shows that the entitlement under ROPA 1998 to claim\n\nadditional increments is from \"the date of the convocation\" which such\n\ndegrees are awarded. ROPA 1998 was replaced by ROPA 2009 which was\n\neffective from 1st January, 2006. There is no provision for payment of\n\nincrements in ROPA 2009 as was previously contained in Rule 12(5) of\n\nROPA 1998. After coming into effect of ROPA 2009, ROPA 1998 ceased to\n\nhave effect. The writ petitioners who have claimed benefit of increments\n\nhave already exercised their option under ROPA 2009 and hence they are\n\nnot entitled to the benefits of increments under ROPA 1998 in view of the\n\njudgment of the Division Bench on 4th December, 2019 in FMA 442 of 2019\n\nin CAN 4752 of 207 (\nThe State of West Bengal & Ors. v. Smt. Mala\n\nSanyal\n).\n\n65. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that the Coordinate Bench\n\nof which one of us (Soumen Sen, J.) was a member has held that a person\n\nclaiming/accepting benefits, by exercising their option under a subsequent\n\nROPA could not claim benefits granted by earlier memorandum and in this\n\nregard has placed reliance on the following paragraphs:\n\"We have to decide the lis between the parties on the basis of\nthe law operating in the field as of date. The decision in\nPradip\nKumar Karak & Ors.\n(supra) is the law\nlaid down by\nthe\ncoordinate Bench. Apart from the well recognised principle of\nbinding precedent we also feel that the memorandum dated\n21st July, 1990 clearly excludes the writ petition. There cannot\nany doubt that the memorandum of 21st July, 1990 is an\nimportant document which clearly excludes the\nrespondent/writ petitioner and many others who have acquired\nqualification post dated 21st July, 1990 and before 26th July,\n1994. We are referring to these particular memoranda because\n26th July, 1994 puts an end to any claim that may be made by\nrespondent/writ petitioner or persons similarly placed who\nhave acquired qualification post 21st July, 1994. In the\nmeantime, ROPA 1999 had come into play by which it seems\nthat the respondent authorities have tried to bring a pay parity\namongst different classes of its employees with effect from 1st\nJanuary, 1996. The respondent/writ petitioner exercised option\nunder ROPA 1999 for receiving benefits with effect from 1st\nJanuary, 1996 of higher scale of pay. This appears to be a\nconscious decision by the writ petitioners and it is an important\nfactor to be taken into consideration at this stage because on\nthat date it was possible for him to challenge the basis of the\nmemorandum dated 21st July, 1990. It is clear case of waiver of\nright. Apart from waiver of right, we are in agreement with the\nview expressed by the co-ordinate Bench that the circular dated\n21st July, 1990 is a clear bar to avail any benefit on the basis of\nhigher qualification acquired on or after 21st of July, 1990 in\nabsence of any separate Government Orders.\n\nThere is another aspect to this matter;\n\nAt the relevant point of time it was incumbent upon the writ petitioner,\nbefore acceptance of a higher scale of pay under ROPA 1990, to claim\nhigher scale of pay on the basis of the Memorandum dated 7th March,\n1990, and to challenge the Memorandum dated 21st July, 1990 and\nthe Memorandum dated 26th July, 1994 which put an end to any\nclaim that could have been made on account of higher scale of pay\nupon acquiring higher qualification. The writ petitioner continued to\navail the benefit of ROPA 1990, ROPA 1998 and ROPA 2009 until the\nwrit petitioner filed the writ application in the year 2015, being W.P.\nNo. 20521 (W) of 2015, on the basis of the judgment in Sibnath Koley\n(supra). Benefits of ROPA 1998 and ROPA 2009 was conferred upon\nthe writ petitioner upon exercising option.\"\n\n66. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that the convocation of the\n\npetitioner was admittedly held after the coming into force of ROPA 2009\n\nand, therefore, the petitioner has no vested rights to claim an incentive\n\nunder the previous ROPA i.e. ROPA 1998.\n\n67. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that the Division Bench in\n\nMAT 961 of 2017 (\nState of West Bengal v. Chandra Bhusan Dwivedi\n)\n\nreported at 2019 SCC Online Cal 6530 in paragraphs 7 to 14 have\n\naddressed this issue. The said paragraphs are reproduced below:\n\n\"7. The order impugned in the appeal was passed by a learned\nSingle Judge of this Court on December 20, 2016 in W. P.\n13043 (W) of 2009. The petitioner challenged an order passed\nby the Director of School Education, West Bengal by which his\nclaim for the benefit of two additional increments by virtue of\nhaving acquired doctorate degree, was rejected.\n\n8. The sole reason for rejecting the petitioner's claim for two\nadditional increments was with reference to\nWest Bengal\nSchools (Control & Expenditure) Act, 2005\nand the provisions\ncontained therein. The learned Single Judge observed that since\nthe basis of the petitioner's case was for ROPA 1998 his claim\ncould not be hit by the said Act. Since the Court did not find any\napplication of the said Act to bar the claim of the petitioner the\nCourt set aside the impugned order and directed the\nrespondents to grant two additional increments from the date of\nconvocation in which the petitioner received his Ph.D degree.\n\n9. If the order impugned in the writ petition was not sustainable\nfor rejecting the prayer of the petitioner on the basis of an Act\nthe order impugned in the appeal is also not sustainable for a\nvery different reason. The learned Single Judge before directing\nthe respondents to pay two additional increments to the\npetitioner ought to have been satisfied about the basis of his\nclaim and whether that could be allowed in the facts of the\npresent case.\n\n10. The petitioner was pressing his claim on the basis of Rule\n12(5) of ROPA 1998. All that the petitioner is required to satisfy\nis that that clause had made him entitled to ask for two\nadditional increments when the doctorate degree was awarded\nto him. In the present case, the convocation was held on\nDecember 15, 2006, by that time ROPA 1998 has ceased to be\nin operation. ROPA 2009 which later on came to be effective\nwith effect from January 1, 2006 does not contain any such\nprovision of law.\n\n11. Rule 12(5) of ROPA 1998 entitles the holder of a doctorate\ndegree to ask for the benefit of two additional increments from\nthe date of convocation when the convocation was held ROPA\n1998 had ceased to exist. Without a corresponding provision in\nthe new ROPA a Division Bench of this Court by a judgment\nand order dated April 5, 2019 in the case of\nState of West\nBengal & Others vs. Goutam Ghosh and Others\n(FMA 2368 of\n2015) observed that since the Rule had ceased to exist on the\nday the degree was awarded the petitioner must be held to be\nineligible to the benefit claimed by him under ROPA 1998.\n\n12. This aspect has not been discussed by the learned Single\nJudge at all. The order impugned in the writ petition was\nultimately right, as the petitioner was not entitled to the benefit\nof two additional increments, though the reasons recorded\ntherein were not correct.\n\n13. At this stage Mr. Barua submitted that the appellant had\nexercised option under ROPA 1998. If that be so his scale of\npay should be fixed under ROPA 1998 and under ROPA 2009.\n\n14. We find sufficient substance in the appeal filed by the\nappellants. The judgment and order of the learned Trial Judge\nis set aside.\"\n\n68. Mr. Advocate General has submitted that the aforesaid view is\n\nthe correct enunciation of the law and needs to be accepted. It is submitted\n\nthat no vested right is created in favour of a person to be continued to be\n\ngranted incentives under any previous policy of a State.\n\nSubmission of Mr. Biswarup Biswas, learned Sr. Counsel on\nbehalf of the appellant in FMA 557 of 2007\n\n69. Mr. Biswarup Biswas the learned Senior Counsel in FMA 557 of\n\n2007 has submitted that the appellant obtained her graduation in Physical\n\nEducation from the University of Calcutta in the year 1998. Thereafter, she\n\nobtained Post Graduate Degree in Physical Education in the year 2001 from\n\nKalyani University. She was selected for the post of Physical education\n\nteacher through the regular recruitment process conducted by the West\n\nBengal School Service Commission in the year 1999. At the time of her\nappoint on 28th March, 2001 to Sinthi Ramkrishna Sangha Vidyamandir\n\n(Girls) as a Physical Education teacher as a pass graduate candidate she\n\njoined the post as assistant teacher in physical education subject in the\n\nschool on 24th April, 2001. After obtaining Masters in Physical Education\n\n(part-II examination) on 21st September, 2001 she applied for higher pay\n\nscale on 24th January, 2004. It was however, denied by the State. She filed a\n\nwrit petition being W.P. No 7291(W) of 2006 which was dismissed by an\n\norder dated 10th April, 2006 upon observing that in view of the provisions of\n\nSections 14\n,\nand\nof the West Bengal Schools (Control and\n\nExpenditure) Act, 2005 she was not entitled to higher scale of pay on\n\nacquiring higher degree.\n\n70. However, in an appeal being FMA No. 557 of 2007 (\nBaishali\n\nBanerjee Vs. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n) the Hon'ble Division Bench\n\nallowed the appeal inter alia, on the following reasons:\n\n\"8. The case in hand is, however, having a salient feature. The\nappellant is a Physical Education teacher. There is no honours\ncourse taught by any of the Universities in the State. Hence\nthere could be no such category in the School Service\nCommission in the concerned subject. We also do not find any\nsuch distinction being made in Physical Education by the\nSchool Service Commission. Hence all candidates who are\nhaving appropriate qualification in Physical Education are\nconsidered in one category i.e. pass category. If that be the\nposition their subsequent acquisition of post graduate\nqualification cannot be equated with any other subject.\n9. In the instant case the appellant undertook post graduate\nstudy. She appeared in the post graduate examination. Before\nthe result could be published she was selected and appointed\nin the post. In the case of Bhaskar Chakraborty (supra) the\nidentical situation happened. Hence in our view, the appellant\nwas entitled to the benefit of the higher pay scale.\n\n10. Let us now examine the said Act of 2005 to find out\nwhether there is any hindrance in the way of extending higher\npay scale to the appellant. Appellant was appointed in 2001.\nShe acquired post graduate qualification in 2001. Hence she\nwas to be considered contemporarily. Her case was\nunnecessary kept pending. Her prayer could not be considered\nto her disadvantage under the provisions of the said Act of\n2005 in this regard. Learned Counsel appearing for the\nappellant has successfully drawn our attention to\nSection 16\n\nwherein it is provided that notwithstanding anything contained\nin the said Act, the terms and conditions of service of a teacher\nshall not be varied to his or her disadvantage in the view of the\ncommencement of the said Act.\n\n11. In Circular dated June 03, 2002 the State considered the\ncases of the candidates who were undergoing post graduate\nstudies or had appeared at the post graduate examination but\nresult was yet to be published. Those candidates, if selected, in\nhonours category were extended post graduate scale after\nacquiring post graduate qualification. Since in Physical\nEducation there is no such distinction between pass category\nand honours category the benefit of the circular dated June 03,\n2002 should be extended to the Physical Education teachers\nbeing similarly circumstanced with Bhaskar Chakraborty\n(supra) and the present appellant.\" (emphasis supplied)\n71. The learned Counsel has also referred to a circular of the School\n\nEducation Department Secondary Branch dated 22nd November, 1993\n\nintimating that the date of effect for granting of the benefit of higher scale of\n\npay i.e. pass graduate scale of pay for assistant teachers of physical\n\neducation under ROPA 1990 would be with effect from 1st January, 1986 or\n\ndate of improvement of qualification whichever is later in terms of para 16(3)\n\nof G.O. No.33- Edn(B) dated 7th March, 1990 as amended by G.O. No.401-\n\nEdn(B) dated 10th September, 1991 and 216-Edn(B) dated 13th May, 1992\n\nand not from 22nd November, 1993 as stated in the department's Memo\n\nNo.795-Edn(S) dated 22nd November, 1993.\n\n72. The learned Counsel has submitted that earlier on 8th March,\n\n2000 a circular was issued by the School Education Department in\n\nclarification of paragraph 3 of the Government Order No.795-Edn(s) dated\n\n22nd November, 1993 by which the benefit of higher scale of pay was\n\nextended to those physical education teachers who have obtained such\n\ndegree on completion of two years regular course from a recognized\n\nuniversity. Subsequently, the State considered the cases of the candidates\n\nwho were undergoing post graduate studies or had appeared at the post\n\ngraduate examination but result was yet to be published in its circular\n\ndated 3rd June, 2002. The government issued the circular of that date\n\nclarifying that those candidates if selected in honours category would be\n\nextended post graduate scale after acquiring post graduate qualification.\n\n73. The learned Counsel submits that since in physical education\n\nthere was no such distinction between pass category and honours category\nthe benefit of circular dated 3rd June, 2002 is required to be extended to the\n\nphysical education teachers being similarly circumstanced with\nBhaskar\n\nChakraborty v. State of West Bengal (WP.\n2326 (w) of 2002) and the\n\npresent appellant.\n\n74. The learned Counsel has submitted that\nTarak Chandra Roy\n\n(supra) is in relation to a post graduate degree holder in physical education.\n\nTarak obtained his masters in physical education in the year 1998 and\n\nappointed in the year 2003 prior to the coming into force of The Control and\n\nExpenditure Act, 2005.\n\n75. However, the Hon'ble Division Bench dismissed the appeal upon\n\nthe consideration of\nSection 14\nof the 2005 Act, which is impermissible\n\nbecause of the fact that the 2005 Act has no retrospective operation and it\n\nhas come into effect only on 26th December, 2005. Tarak has been\n\nappointed as assistant teacher in 2003 with post graduate degree. Therefore,\n\nthe circular dated 22nd November, 1993 and 8th March, 2000 had no\n\nmanner of application in view of the circular dated 3rd June, 2002 and the\n\ndecision in\nBhaskar Chakraborty\n(supra).\n\n76. Mr. Biswas further submits that since\nsection 16\nof the West\n\nBengal Schools Control of Expenditure Act 2005 preserves the previous\n\nrights in the limited manner as specified therein and hence\nSection 20\nof the\n\nsaid Act cannot be interpreted to have any overriding effect in respect of\n\nentitlement of Post Graduate scale of pay in terms of ROPA RULES 1981,\n\n1990 and 1998 respectively. Therefore\nSection 20\nof the Act of 2005 has no\nmanner of application in the matter of curtailing any right that the writ\n\npetitioner/appellant had under the relevant clause of the earlier regulations.\n\nIn support of the same Mr. Biswas has relied on a single Bench decision of\n\nthis Hon'ble High Court in the case of Trilachan Jana VS State Of West\n\nBengal reported in 2008 (2) WBLR 913 (paragraph 9 to 11).\n\n77. Mr Biswas argues that the staff pattern of the school does not\n\nhave any nexus with the entitlement of the post graduate scale of pay. The\n\ngrant of scale relatable to qualification to one teacher and denial thereof on\n\nthe anvil of different qualification to another teacher who is teaching the\n\nsame subject in the same class in the same school or in different aided\n\nrecognised Non-Government schools or Government sponsored Schools\n\nunder the same Education Directorate would violate the principle of equal\n\npay for equal work and offend\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\nIn\n\nsupport of his submission he relies on a single bench decision in the case of\n\nSampa Sahu (Mondal) v. State Of West Bengal\n, reported in 2009 (1) C.LJ\n\n(CAL) (paragraph 21 to 27):\n\n\"(21) The staff pattern of Schools including Madrashas were, at\nall material times governed by Government Circulars and/or\nOrders issued in this regard from time to time. The relevant\nGovernment Orders indicate that qualifications for the same\nteaching post were to be fixed percentage wise. Out of two\nposts of Language Group teachers in a Junior High School, the\nminimum requisite qualification for one post was Pass Graduate\nand the minimum requisite qualification for the other Honours\nGraduate/Masters degree. When additional posts were\nsanctioned, the same percentage ratio was maintained. Thus, if\na School was sanctioned two posts of Bengali Teachers who\nwere required to teach Bengali in the same classes, the\nminimum requisite qualification for one post could be Pass\nGraduate and the minimum qualification for the other post\ncould be Honours/Masters degree in Bengali.\n\n(22) There were teaching posts in Junior High\nSchools/Madrasahs for which the requisite qualification was\nPass Graduate and there were teaching posts, also, in Junior\nHigh Schools/Madrasahs for which the minimum qualification\nwas Honours Graduate and/or Post Graduate degree. The\nfixation of a higher qualification for some posts and lower\nqualification for others, apparently had nothing to do with the\nteaching duties pertaining to the post, at least at the material\ntime.\n\n(23) It also appears that although there has recently been some\nchange in the rules of appointment through the School Service\nCommission, at the material time, Honours Graduates and Pass\nGraduates had to compete in a common selection test.\n\n(24) In the aforesaid circumstances, the payment of scale\npertaining to qualification to one teacher and denial of scale\npertaining to qualification to another teacher, teaching the same\nsubject in the same class in the same school or in different\naided recognized Non-Government schools would violate the\nprinciple of equal pay for equal work and offend\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution of India.\n\n(25) If the minimum requisite qualification for some posts of\nAssistant Teachers of Language Group was B. A. (Honours)\nand/or M. A degree, the minimum qualification for the teaching\npost for the aforesaid category could have to be deemed as B.A.\n(Honours)/M.A. degree.\n[26) Mr. Bhattacharya, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of\nthe State cited a Division Bench judgment of this Court in\nTarak\nChandra Roy v. State of West Bengal and Ors.\n, reported in\n2008(2) Calcutta Law Times 240 (HC).\n\n(27) In the aforesaid case, the Division Bench was of the view\nthat after the enforcement of the\nWest Bengal School Service\nCommission Act, 1997\n, the circulars dated 22nd November,\n1993 and 8th March, 2000 pertaining to teachers of Physical\nEducation had no manner of application.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n78. Mr Biswas submits that the School Education Department has\n\nissued a notification. No. 593-SE (B) dated 27th November, 2007 to modify\n\nthe\nSection 14 (3)\nOf the West Bengal (Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005, as\n\nwell as G.O. No. 1595 dated 26th December, 2005. However, the said assent\n\nof the Hon'ble Governor and never published in the Official Gazette and\n\ntherefore it can be treated only as an administrative order or instruction and\n\ndoes not have any statutory force. The said notification cannot modify the\n\nstatutory rule and the Government Order dated 26th December, 2005. The\n\nnotification dated 27th November, 2007 appears to have been issued in\n\nderogation of the 2005 Act and the Government Order dated 26th December,\n\n2005 and hence cannot be enforced.\n\n79. The learned Counsel has relied upon the document filed as\n\n\"Information related to Memo No.12-SE/RTI/BS-631/2018 dated 4th\n\nJanuary, 2019\" issued by Assistant Secretary School Education\n\nDepartment, Government of West Bengal in response to a RTI that the\n\navailable record of the Department does not reveal that notification/circular\nNo. 593-SE (B) dated 27th November, 2007 has been published in 'Kolkata\n\nGazette Extraordinary'.\n\n80. The said notification issued in exercise of power conferred under\n\nthe\nWest Bengal Schools (Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005\n. However, it has\n\nnot been notified in the Official Gazette and the notification/ circular dated\n\n27th November, 2007, does not have the assent of the Hon'ble Governor and\n\ntherefore the said notification/ circular is only an Administrative order or\n\ninstruction and does not have any statutory force. The said notification\n\ncannot modify statutory rule of the Government Order dated 26th December,\n\n2005. The notification dated 27th November, 2007 has been issued in\n\nderogation of the statute and cannot be enforced. The learned Counsel relied\n\non a document filed as \"Information related to Memo No.12-SE/RTI/BS-\n\n631/2018 dated 4th January, 2019\" issued by Assistant Secretary School\n\nEducation Department, Government of West Bengal in response to a RTI\n\nthat the available record of the Department does not reveal that\n\nnotification/circular No. 593-SE (B) dated 27th November, 2007 has been\n\npublished in 'Kolkata Gazette Extraordinary'.\n\n81. The learned Counsel has relied on Division Bench decision\n\nrendered in the case of\nAkhtar Hossain Chowdhury v. STATE OF WEST\n\nBENGAL\n, reported in 2013 2 CHN 632 (paragraph 14 to 16) to buttress his\n\nsubmission that that a circular cannot override the statutory provisions.\n\nSubmission of Mr. Subir Sanyal, Sr. Advocate on behalf of\nArchana Pramanik and Manas Kumar Ghorai.\n82. Mr. Subir Sanyal the learned Senior Counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the respondent/writ petitioners Archana Pramanick and Manas\n\nKumar Ghorai in FMA No.143 of 2022 and FMA 125 of 2022 respectively\n\nhas submitted that the condition of prior permission of the authority\n\ncompetent to grant permission in respect of a teacher who has been\n\nappointed to WBSSC in Honours/Post Graduate Teacher Category for\n\nimprovement of his qualification of post graduate degree after joining the\n\npost to make himself or herself entitled to draw pay scale of a post graduate\n\nteacher as per Clause (c) of the Order No.1595 SE(S) dated 26th December,\n\n2005 under\nSection 14(3)\nof the Act of 2005 is illegal, arbitrary,\n\nunreasonable and violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n83. Mr. Sanyal submits that in order to appreciate the aforesaid\n\nargument it is necessary to refer to the ROPA Rules from 1981 to 2009 and\n\nthe provisions of the\nWest Bengal School Service Commissions Act, 1997\n\nand the Rules framed thereunder as also the\nWest Bengal Schools (Control\n\nof Expenditure) Act, 2005\n.\n\n84. Mr. Sanyal submits that ROPA 1981 was formulated after\n\ncareful consideration of the recommendation by the Governor with regard to\n\nthe entitlement of the teaching and non-teaching staff of the\n\nsponsored/aided institution to draw pay in the revised scale of pay as\n\nshown in column 4. It provides for issuance of separate order regarding\n\nfixation of pay in the revised scale of pay on the analogy of the State\n\nGovernment Rules. Clause 4 stipulates that all orders issued by the\n\nEducation Department regulating the conditions of service of the employees\nand the pay scales of the posts shown in the annexure of the said order\n\nshall be effective subject to the provisions of this order. Clause 6 provides\n\nfor exercise of an option either to retain existing scale of pay with existing\n\nterms and conditions of service or to come under the revised scale of pay\n\ntogether with the revised terms and conditions of the service as may be\n\ndetermined by the State of West Bengal.\n\n85. The ROPA 1981 also provided for higher pay scale for teachers\n\nof secondary school in future only upon obtaining higher qualification in the\n\nsubject relevant to their teaching/appointment.\n\n86. Mr. Sanyal has referred to Order No. 492 (6)-Edn(B) dated 26th\n\nOctober, 1981 issued by the Order of the Governor in pursuance of\n\nparagraph 3 of Memorandum No. 372-Edn(B) dated 31 July, 1981 by\n\nwhich the pay of the teaching and the non-teaching staff of the non-\n\ngovernment/sponsored/aided educational institutions and other\n\norganisations was fixed in the revised scale of pay as sanctioned in the\n\ngovernment order dated 31st July, 1981.\n\n87. It is submitted that Clause 4 provides for exercise of option and\n\nin Clause 4(3) it is made clear that once option is exercised it shall be final\n\nand cannot be modified at subsequent date.\n\n88. It is submitted that Clause 5 provides for benefit of next higher\n\nscale of pay in certain contingency, namely, teacher who has not got single\n\npromotion or appointment in any higher grade in the same post even after\n\ncompletion of 8 years continuous and satisfactory service. They shall be\nplaced in the next higher scale of pay as shown in Annexure-II of G.O. No.\n\n372-Edn(B) dated 31 July, 1981.\n\n89. Clause 6 provides for stagnation of pay and Clause 7 provides\n\nfor pay fixation on promotion or appointment.\n\n90. The Memorandum No. 372-Edn (B) dated 31st July, 1981\n\nnamely, ROPA 1981 refers to annexure- I which, inter alia, stipulate for\n\nhigher scale of pay on qualification without any restriction to all existing\n\nsecondary school teachers upon improvements of qualifications relevant to\n\ntheir teaching subject.\n\n91. The aforesaid provision was amended by Memorandum No.52-\n\nEd(B) dated 14th February, 1992 to the effect that the words \"all existing\n\nsecondary school teachers\" were substituted by the words \"who entered\n\nservice with higher qualifications or.............\". Mr. Sanyal has referred to\n\nNote Clause 2(b) of the annexure to the ROPA 1981 to show that all existing\n\nSecondary School Teachers who have improved their qualifications not\n\nrelevant to their teaching subjects will be allowed the higher scale on\n\nqualification basis after five years' teaching counting from the date on\n\nwhich higher qualification was obtained.\n\n92. By Government Notification no. 400-Edn(B) dated 10th\n\nSeptember, 1991 the above Clause-(b) was substituted by the provision \"all\n\nexisting secondary school teachers who were appointed with higher\n\nqualifications in subjects not relevant to their teaching or who improve their\n\nqualifications subsequent to their appointment in subject not relevant to\ntheir teaching will be allowed the higher scale on qualification basis with\n\neffect from 1 April, 1991 or after 5 years teaching counting from the date on\n\nwhich higher qualification was obtained whichever is later\".\n\n93. It is submitted that a close scrutiny of the provisions of\n\nMemorandum no. 372-Edn(B) dated 31 July, 1981 read with later circulars\n\nissued by the Governor in exercise of power under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India in the Rules creates a right of entitlement in favour\n\nof an existing school teacher either upon obtaining higher qualification or at\n\nthe time of entry in service with higher qualifications relevant to the\n\nteaching subject for higher scale on qualification basis without any\n\nrestrictions and also for obtainment of higher qualification not relevant to\n\nthe teaching subject after 5 years. Entitlement of higher scale is thus linked\n\nwith the qualification and this is not an incentive. This is one of the terms\n\nand conditions of the service as per the aforesaid order of the Governor\n\nissued in exercise of power under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n94. Similarly, the benefit of next higher scale of pay in certain cases,\n\nstagnation of pay, pay fixation on promotion or appointment as provided for\n\nin Government Order No. 492(6)-Edn(B) dated 26.10.1981 formed part of\n\nthe terms and conditions of service having been issued by the Governor in\n\npursuance of Memorandum no. 372-Edn(B) dated 31 July, 1981.\n\nTherefore, they were and are enforceable rights.\n95. It is submitted that even if it is held that the benefits of next\n\nhigher scale of pay in certain case, stagnation pay, pay fixation on\n\npromotion or appointment as aforesaid are incentive, even then those\n\nbenefits are enforceable as they form part of the terms and conditions of\n\nservice as per G.O.No. 372-Edn(B) dated 31 July, 1981.\n\n96. Mr. Sanyal refers to ROPA 1990 and submits that proviso to\n\nClause 5 of ROPA 1990 provides for exercise of option at the discretion of\n\nthe employees for retaining existing scale of pay with existing condition of\n\nservice or for coming over to the revised scale of pay to the revised terms\n\nand conditions of service as may be determined by the Government.\n\n97. Mr. Sanyal submits that Clause 16 (1) provides for placement\n\nin the next higher scale of pay while his designation remaining unchanged\n\nand who has not got a single promotion/advancement to a higher scale in\n\nthe same posts even after completion of 18 years of continuous and\n\nsatisfactory service.\n\n98. Clause 16(2) thereof makes a member of the teaching and non\n\nteaching staff entitled to an additional increment in the revised scale of pay\n\nfor every 10 years of continuous and satisfactory service counted form the\n\ndate of appointment subject to a maximum two such increment in addition\n\nto benefit under sub-para (1).\n\n99. Clause 16 (3) provides for higher scale of pay appropriate to\n\ntheir qualification for all teacher and librarians of secondary schools who\n\nhave improved/will improve their qualification or were appointed with higher\nqualification in the subject or group relevant to their teaching /appointment\n\nwith effect from 1 January, 1986 or the date of improving qualification\n\nwhichever is later.\n\n100. Clause 16(3) as above was substituted by way of amendment\n\nvide Memorandum No. 401-Edn(B) dated 10 September, 1991 issued by\n\nthe Governor to the following effect:\n\n\"All teacher and librarians of secondary schools who improve\ntheir qualification in subjects relevant to their\nteaching/appointment shall get higher scale of pay appropriate\nto their qualification with effect from the date of improving\nqualification\".\n\n101. A bare reading of ROPA, 1990 issued by the Governor in\n\nexercise of power under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India\n\ncontains Rules providing for the revised scales of pay, age of\n\nsuperannuation, retirement benefits and other terms and conditions of\n\nservice as enumerated therein. Therefore, entitlement of higher scale of pay\n\nappropriate to the qualifications of teachers and librarians of secondary\n\nschools who have improved or will improve their qualification or were\n\nappointed with higher qualification in subject or group relevant to their\n\nteaching criterion is one of the terms and conditions of service as per the\n\nRules, (ROPA, 1990). Entitlement to the higher scale of pay is thus linked\n\nwith qualification and an enforceable right, not an incentive. This is earned\n\nby acquisition of higher qualification which ultimately ensures to the benefit\n\nof the educational institution and the students.\n102. Benefit of placement in the next higher scale of pay upon\n\ncompletion of 18 years continuous satisfactory service for not having a\n\nsingle promotion or advancement to a higher scale in the same post also\n\nforms part of the terms and conditions of service as per the Rules i.e. ROPA\n\n1990 and the same is enforceable right in law. If it is at all held to be an\n\nincentive, even then the same is enforceable right in law for making it a part\n\nof the terms and conditions of service. Moreover, it is a beneficial provision\n\nallowing advancement or promotion in the higher scale upon 18 years\n\ncontinuous and satisfactory service and cannot be taken away, by executive\n\nwhims.\n\n103. Mr. Sanyal submits that ROPA 1998 contained Clause 12(3)\n\nsimilar to Clause 16(3) of ROPA 1990 entitling teachers to higher scale of\n\npay who have improved or will improve their qualification or who were\n\nappointed with higher qualification in the subjects or groups relevant to\n\ntheir teaching or appointment with effect from 1st January, 1996 or the date\n\nof improving qualification whichever is later.\n\n104. Like the ROPA, 1990 the subsequent ROPA 1998 also provides\n\nfor a condition of service entitling a teacher to a higher scale of pay linked\n\nwith his qualification and is enforceable in law.\n\n105. It is submitted that Clause 12(1) and (2) of ROPA 1998 are\n\nsimilar to Clause 16 (1) and (2) of ROPA 1990.\n\n106. Mr. Sanyal has referred to Section 9 and 10 of WBSSC Act,\n\n1997 to emphasise that the terms and conditions of a service of teaching\nand non-teaching staff shall not be varied to their disadvantage, insofar as\n\nsuch terms and conditions related to the appointments of such teachers to\n\nthe post held by them immediately before commencement of the Act.\n\nMoreover, their service has been guaranteed under ROPA 1990 entitling\n\nhigher scale of pay on acquisition of higher qualification which has been\n\nretained and reiterated.\n\n107. Mr. Sanyal has referred to the Memorandum No.155-SE(B)\n\ndated 13th July, 1999 by which amendment was made to Clause 12(3) of\n\nROPA 1998 by way of substitution to the effect that \"..............such higher\n\nqualified teachers in the relevant subjects or group is justified as per\n\napproved staff pattern of the school, if such teachers is appointed through\n\nWBSSC, his/her pay will be fixed in the scale of pay as per his/her\n\nqualification mentioned by the West Bengal School Service Commission\".\n\n108. It is submitted that Circular No.735-SE(S) dated 3rd June,\n\n2002 issued by the School Education Department, Government of West\n\nBengal purportedly amending Memorandum No.155-SE(B) dated 13th July,\n\n1999 amending Memorandum No.25-SE(B) dated 12th February, 1998, has\n\nincluded and thereby widened the scope of Memorandum No. 155-SE(B)\n\ndated 13th July, 1999 to the effect that Honours graduate teachers\n\nappointed through WBSSC who have completed their course of studies at\n\npost graduate level in the subject relevant to their appointment or have\n\nappeared at the examination but result of that examination was not\n\npublished till the date of their joining would be allowed scale of pay with\neffect from the date of joining or the date following the last date of\n\nexamination whichever is later.\n\n109. Subsequently, Government Order No.1334-SE(S) dated 3rd\n\nNovember, 2004 was issued by the School Education Department,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal for determination of the date from which post\n\ngraduate scale will be allowed to eligible teachers on acquiring of post\n\ngraduate degree in partial modification of G.O.No. 735-SE(S) dated 3rd\n\nJune, 2002 to the following effect:-\n\ni. Honours graduate teachers of Hons./Post Graduate category\n\nappointed through WBSSC who obtained post graduate degree in\n\nsubject relevant to their appointment prior to their joining shall be\n\neligible for post graduate scale of pay from the date of joining.\n\nii. The Honours graduate teachers of Hons./Post Graduate category\n\nwho have completed their examination before joining but results\n\nwere published after joining be eligible to post graduate scale of pay\n\nfrom the date of publication of result.\n\niii. Honours graduate teachers of Hons./Post Graduate category\n\nappointed through SSC who had improved or will improve\n\nqualification after joining the post with due permission from the\n\nauthority competent to issue such permission, be eligible for post\n\ngraduate scale on successful results of last examination leading to\n\npost graduate degree from the day following the last day of\n\nexamination.\n110. It is submitted that point No.(iii) is discriminatory, illegal and\n\nviolates\nArticle 14\nof Constitution of India having no intelligible differentia\n\nand no nexus with the object to be achieved.\n\n111. Mr. Sanyal has referred to Section 5(1) and 5(3) and 14 of the\n\nControl of Expenditure Act, 2005, and Order No.1595-SE(S) dated 26th\n\nDecember, 2005 and highlighted the circumstances entitling a teacher to a\n\nhigher grade scale and additional increment under\nSection 14(3)\nof the Act,\n\n2005.\n\n112. Mr. Sanyal submits that Order No. 1595-SE(S) dated 26th\n\nDecember, 2005 specified the following circumstances where an Honours or\n\nPost Graduate Scale of Pay can be claimed by a teacher:\n\na. prior to his joining has acquired post graduate degree in the\nsubject relevant to the appointment be entitled to pay of post\ngraduate teacher category from the date of joining the post or\n\nb. completed examination for post graduate degree, prior to joining\nthe post, in the subject relevant to the appointment, but the\nresults of such examination published after joining the post shall\nbe entitled to draw pay of post graduate teacher category from the\ndate of publication of result of such examination.\n\nc. improved his or her qualification after joining the post with prior\npermission of the authority competent to grant such permission,\non being successful in the results of the examination for the post\ngraduate degree in the subject relevant to the appointment, be\nentitled to draw post graduate teacher category from the day next\nfollowing the last date of such examination.\n113. In referring to Order No.593-SE(B) dated 27th November, 2007\n\nMr. Sanyal submits that the said order specified the manner in which a\n\nteacher would be entitled to claim an additional increment or higher scale of\n\npay under\nSection 14(3)\nof the 2005 Act. The salient features are:\n\ni. Teacher to take prior permission from the Managing Committee\nto enrol themselves or to appear for any examination for\nenhancement of educational qualification.\n\nii. Teacher to apply for leave/special leave/study leave with\nresolution of Managing Committee to the WBBSE through MC of\nSchool.\n\niii. to seek prior permission of D.I. of Schools if he or she wants to\nclaim additional increment or higher scale of pay for obtaining\nsuch higher qualification through MC of School.\n\niv. No such permission to be granted on any ground to a teacher\nwho entered service or joined the school with graduate degree with\nscale of pay.\n\nv. Courses to be studied should be relevant to the subjects studied\nin under graduate honours/post graduate course of the applicant\nteacher and none other.\n\nvi. Prayer from teachers who had already secured higher\nqualification observing above procedure and submitted claim to\nconcern D.I. of Schools with complete set of papers may be\nconsidered only by D.I. of Schools with approval of DSE, W.B. only\nafter examination of the staff pattern, vacancy position of the\nschool.\n\nvii. No prayer for higher scale of pay from graduate degree teacher\nwith graduate scale of pay at the time of entry into service /joining\nthe school will be entertained. No matter whether he or she has\nsecured such higher qualification before or after in introduction of\nAct of 2005.\n\nviii This order will replace all earlier orders published before\ncoming into force of the Act of 2005 and also modifies the order\nNo. 1595 dated 26th December, 2005.\n\n114. Curiously, Order No. 1595-SE dated 26th December, 2005 was\n\nissued by the Governor in exercise of power under Sub-\nSection 3\nof\nSection\nof the Act of the West Bengal School (Control and Expenditure) Act, 2005\n\nand such order of the Governor is being modified by an executive Order\n\nNo.593-SE(B) dated 27th November, 2007 by order of the Joint Secretary,\n\nSchool Education Department, Government of West Bengal and not by the\n\nGovernor in exercise of His power. This action is impermissible and therefore\n\nthe Order No. 593-SE(B) dated 27th November, 2007 is illegal, unlawful\n\nand nonest in the eye of law.\n\n115. Condition to obtain prior permission of the authority competent\n\nto grant such permission in respect of a teacher who has been appointed\n\nthrough WBSSC in Honours/Post graduate teacher category for\n\nimprovement of his qualification of post graduate degree after joining the\n\npost to make himself or herself entitled to draw pay post graduate teacher\n\ncategory as per Clause (C) of the Order No. 1595 SE(S) dated 26th\n\nDecember, 2005 issued by the Governor under\nSection 14(3)\nof the Act of\n\n2005 is illegal, arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of the provisions of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India and the provisions of\nSection 14(3)\nof\n\nthe Act of 2005 for the following reasons:\ni. The object of the order is to put the same classes of person on\nthe same pedestal for being selected by competing with the post\ngraduate degree candidates on the same syllabus and same set\nof question papers in the examination conducted by the WBSSC\nand preparation of single panel in a subject from amongst both\nHonours degree candidates and Post Graduate degree\ncandidates.\n\nii. As per Clause (a), a teacher who prior to joining acquired post\ngraduate degree would be automatically entitled to draw post\ngraduate teacher category from the date of joining the post\nwithout consideration to staff pattern, vacancy position etc.\n\niii. As per Clause (b); a Teacher who, prior to joining the post,\ncompleted the examination for the post graduate degree in the\nsubject relevant to the appointment but result of such\nexamination published after joining would be entitled to draw\npay at post graduate teacher category from the date of\npublication of result without any consideration to staff pattern,\nvacancy position of the school etc.\n\niv. There is no intelligible differentia and basis for putting (a)\nand (b) classes of teachers in one category and that of (c) classes\nof teachers in a different category though they stand on the\nsame footing. It constitutes violation of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India.\n\nv. Staff Pattern as per GO dated 4 September, 1998 stipulates\nfor science category three teachers, subject to strength of\nstudents and sanctioned posts, one from pass category and two\nfrom Honours/Master degree category. Similarly, also in case of\nsocial science group and language group. Therefore, there is no\ndistinction between Honours Graduate teacher and Master\nDegree/Post Graduate teacher. They are in the same category of\npost. This in consideration of above factors automatically\nentitles a teacher who obtained or improved higher qualification\nto higher scale of pay.\n116. In view of the aforesaid Mr. Sanyal submits that the questions\n\nare to be answered in favour of the teachers.\n\nSubmission of Mr. Samaresh Chandra Dhara, Learned\nCounsel on behalf of the petitioner in WPA 4698 of 2016\n\n117. Mr. Samaresh Chandra Dhara learned Counsel on appearing in\n\nWPA No.4698 of 2016 Subodh Kumar Biswas v. State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs., adapts the submission of Mr. Subir Sanyal, Senior Advocate. It is\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner was duly appointed as an assistant Teacher in\n\nBengali in Nasra High School, Ranaghat, post B.A. (Bengali). The\n\nappointment was approved with effect from 7th March, 1996 in view of the\n\nfact that the writ petitioner at the time of joining was having an M.A. Degree\n\nin Bengali. The school authority did not restrict the writ petitioner to take\n\nclasses on the basis of an initial qualification, the petitioner was forced to\n\ntake classes in the higher secondary section, the school has admitted that\n\nthe petitioner has taken class in the high secondary section, however the\n\npetitioner was denied higher scale of pay on the basis of higher qualification\n\nalthough his service was utilised by the school authorities. The prayer for\n\nhigher scale of pay was rejected by the District Inspector Schools, (SE) Nadia\n\nthough the writ petitioner was permitted to take the classes in the higher\n\nsecondary section only in view of his higher qualification and his services\n\nhas been duly utilized by the school. In view of the above the writ petitioner\n\nis entitled to higher scale of pay for his higher qualification.\n\nSubmission of Mr. Kamalesh Bhattacharyya, Sr. Advocate on\nbehalf of the Writ Petitioners in FMA No.387 of 2020\n118. Mr. Kamalesh Bhattacharyya learned Senior Counsel\n\nrepresenting Bisweswar Bera & Anr., in FMA No.387 of 2020 has adopted\n\nthe submission made by Mr. Subir Sanyal learned Senior Advocate of all the\n\nfour issues. It is submitted that the respondent no.1 joined as Assistant\n\nTeacher with B.A. (Pass) in English on 2nd November, 1998 on the basis of\n\nthe recommendation of Regional School Service Commission, Western\n\nRegion. He passed M.A. Part-I and Part-II on the basis of the result\n\npublished on 15th May, 1998 and 15th May, 2000 respectively and last date\n\nof examination for M.A. Part-II in English was 30th November, 1999. His\n\nprayer for post graduate scale was refused by District Inspector of Schools\n\non 13th February, 2009 relying on Government order dated 27th November,\n\n2007 and hence, the writ petition was filed.\n\n119. The writ petition being W.P.No. 8411(W) of 2009 was allowed\n\nby the Hon'ble Justice Debangshu Basak by which it was directed that\n\nbenefit of post graduate scale should be disbursed to the petitioner by the\n\nconcerned authority. Against the same F.M.A. 387 of 2020 has been\n\npreferred.\n\n120. In addition to submission made by Mr. Sanyal it is submitted by\n\nMr. Bhattacharyya that the Control of Expenditure Act was introduced in\n\n2005. The teacher concerned has acquired the post graduate qualification in\n\n2000 and at that point of time ROPA 1999 was in vogue and notification\n\ndated 12th February, 1999 was holding the field regarding awarding of post\n\ngraduate scale on improvement of qualification irrespective of having\nHonours Degree or Pass Degree in graduation level. Clause 12(3) of\n\nMemorandum dated 12th December, 1999 reads as follows:\n\n\"All teachers including Physical Education Teachers and\nLibrarians of Secondary Schools who have improved/will improve\ntheir qualifications who were appointed with higher qualification\nin the subjects or groups relevant to their teaching/appointment\nshall get higher scale of pay appropriate to their qualifications,\nwith effect from the 1st January, 1996 or the date of improving\nqualifications whichever is later.\"\n\n121. The aforesaid benefit was withdrawn from the respondent\n\nteachers by virtue of notification No. 155 dated 13th July, 1999 whereby it\n\nwas clarified that benefit under circular dated 12th February, 1999 will be\n\navailable provided such qualification is mentioned in the recommendation\n\nmade by the School Service Commission. As a result the petitioner being a\n\npass graduate and in spite of having M.A. qualification since 2000 she or he\n\nwas not awarded post graduate scale of pay. In the staff pattern also the\n\npost graduate qualification was registered as teacher having post graduate\n\nqualification in the matter of filling up the vacancies in post graduate level\n\nexcepting the pay disparity. The notification dated 13th July, 1999 is only an\n\nadministrative order and it has no retrospective effect and as such the\n\nbenefit as accrued in favour of a teacher by virtue of notification dated 12th\n\nFebruary, 1999 cannot be divested by the subsequent notification dated 13th\n\nJuly, 1999 as it has no retrospective effect.\n\n122. The question needs to be considered whether the teachers\n\nappointed before 2005 who improved their qualification after introduction of\n\nControl of Expenditure Act, 2005 can be denied the scale of pay pertaining\nto their higher qualification on the ground of non-mentioning of such\n\nqualification by the School Service Commission in their recommendation.\n\nMentioning of qualification in the recommendation of School Service\n\nCommission cannot be the sole criteria for determination of the pay scale of\n\na teacher and any denial of higher pay or incentive against the higher\n\nqualification so acquired if it would result in utter discrimination amongst\n\nthe same class of teachers who were enjoying such higher pay scale merely\n\nbecause they were appointed and improved their qualification prior to their\n\nrecommendation by School Service Commission. The teachers having similar\n\nqualification have been treated unequally and discriminatorily by virtue of\n\ngovernment instructions by way of administrative orders. The Control of\n\nExpenditure Act has no effect in respect of the appointment made and\n\nimprovement of qualification made prior to 2005.\n\n123. The order passed on 27th November, 2007 under Memo No. 593\n\nby the School Education Department also has no retrospective effect. It\n\ncannot regulate such class of teachers as that of the present answering\n\nrespondents. In fact a total bar has been imposed on 27th November, 2007\n\nwith regard to grant of prayer for higher scale of pay from any teacher with\n\ngraduate degree and graduate scale of pay at the time of entry into service,\n\nno matter such qualification was acquired before or after introduction of the\n\nControl of Expenditure Act 2005.\n\n124. Mr. Bhattacharyya submitted that there cannot be a\n\ndiscrimination between a teacher with Honours degree and subsequently\n\nacquired post graduate degree and a teacher with an initial qualification of a\npass graduate and thereafter acquiring post graduate qualification, that is,\n\nB.A (Hon's) and M.A with B.A (pass) and M.A having regard to their nature\n\nof work. They cannot be treated separately as they would be discharging the\n\nsame kind of work in the academic field.\n\nSubmission of Mr. Chaturvedi, Advocate on behalf of the writ\npetitioners in WPA 4698 of 2016\n\n125. Mr. Chaturvedi appearing on behalf of the aforesaid writ\n\npetitioners while adopting the submission advanced by Mr. Sanyal has\n\nsubmitted that on the principle of equal pay for equal work the teachers who\n\nhave acquired higher qualification in course of the employment should be\n\ntreated at par with teachers who have entered the service with higher\n\nqualification as both of them have acquired such qualification through the\n\nsame process of examination having same syllabus and would be\n\ndischarging same kind of duties.\n\n126. Mr. Chaturvedi submits that it is not unknown that schools due\n\nto paucity of qualified teachers sometime required the service of teachers\n\nwho have acquired higher qualification after their appointments to take\n\nclasses and as their capability to take classes by reason of their acquired\n\nknowledge cannot be doubted they can expect equal pay for equal work.\n\n127. Mr. Chaturvedi has submitted that in fact the government in its\n\nCircular dated 27th January, 1995 have even permitted teachers who have\n\nobtained higher qualification in subjects not relevant to their respective\n\nsubject or group in which they were appointed in schools but relevant to\ntheir respective teaching subjects to draw according to their respective\n\nhigher qualification subject to certain conditions being fulfilled.\n\n128. Mr. Chaturvedi submits that once it is established that duties\n\nand responsibilities of these teachers who have acquired higher qualification\n\nduring employment are similar and are discharging similar kind of job the\n\nbenefit of higher scale of pay cannot be denied.\n\n129. Mr. Chaturvedi submits that even temporary appointees are\n\nentitled to equal pay for equal work as held in\nBhagwan Dass & Ors. v.\n\nState of Haryana & Ors.\n, reported in 1987(4) SCC 634.\n\n130. For all the above reasons, according to the respondents the\n\nreference of questions is fit for an answer to the effect that improvement of\n\nqualification by graduate teachers should not debar them from getting the\n\npost graduate scale particularly when such qualification was acquired prior\n\nto 2005\nExpenditure, Act\nand the circular dated 13th July, 1999 is\n\nunconstitutional, arbitrary and is liable to be quashed.\n\nSubmission of Lina Mazumdar on behalf of the Writ\nPetitioner in WPA 29710 of 2013\n\n131. Ms. Lina Majumdar, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of\n\nthe writ petitioner has submitted that the writ petitioner is entitled to two\n\nadditional increments on successful completion of Ph.D. Degree which was\n\nclaimed in terms of Clause 16(5) of G.O. No.33-Edn.(B) dated 7th March,\n\n1990 and Clause 12(5) of G.O. No. 25-SE(B)/1M-102/98 dated 12th\n\nFebruary, 1999. The aforesaid provision was entitled to two additional\nincrements who had acquired a Ph. D. Degree prior to coming into force of\n\nG.O. No. 46-SE(B)/5B-1/2009 dated 27th February, 2009 would be entitled\n\nto two additional increments from the date when the provisional certificate\n\nwas issued to Pampa Das on 8th May, 2005 as she acquired the Doctorate\n\ndegree on that date. It is submitted that ROPA 2009 cannot stand in the\n\nway in granting incremental benefits to Pampa for her Ph. D degree as ROPA\n\n2009 cannot have retrospectively effect from 1st January, 2006 i.e. after the\n\ndate when the writ petitioner acquired Ph.D. Degree. The claim of the\n\npetitioner shall be governed by the provision of ROPA 1998.\n\nAnalysis and Conclusions\n\n132. We now propose to decide the issues raised by the parties. The\n\ncontentious issues are formulated in the order of reference, however, it\n\nhinges primarily on the entitlement of a teacher to a higher scale of pay\n\nupon acquiring higher qualification and if such issue is decided in the\n\naffirmative what would be the relevant date. Incidentally it also concerns the\n\nissue of incentives extended to teachers on acquiring higher qualification or\n\nunder relevant government orders as CAS.\n\n133. The learned Counsel for the parties has extensively referred to\n\nROPA Rules since 1981 till 2009 in support of their respective claims. The\n\nmain impediment, hurdle and obstruction appear to be the government\n\norder dated 13th July, 1999, the Control and Expenditure Act, 2005 and\n\nsubsequent notification issued thereunder regulating pay scale and other\n\nfinancial benefits.\n134.\nSection 14(3)\nof the 2005 Act has been interpreted differently by\n\nthe learned Counsel in relation to ROPA Rules prior and subsequent thereof.\n\nOn an over view of the rules starting from ROPA 1981 it appears that the\n\ngovernment from time to time has altered and amended the eligibility\n\ncriteria of teachers to claim higher scale of pay. The requirement to have the\n\nhigher qualification in a relevant subject has a rational basis. The teacher\n\nappointed in a subject if he has acquired a higher qualification in course of\n\nhis employment in the relevant subject is likely to benefit the institution and\n\nthe students.\n\n135. The authorities concerned shall not ordinarily deny such benefit\n\nto a teacher who has improved his qualification in the relevant subject\n\nduring his service.\n\n136. Under the ROPA 1981 the pay scale of the posts of the teachers\n\nwould be as per the schedule mentioned in annexure I. The said Rule\n\ncontains the following note as modified during 1981 and 1992:\n\n\"N.B.:\n\n1) All existing Secondary School teachers will be allowed annual\nincrements in the revised scales of pay provided that untrained\nteachers will have to get themselves trained within 5 years from\nApril 1981 failing which their increment will be stopped till they\nget themselves trained.\n\n2. (a) All existing Secondary School teachers who have improved\ntheir qualification relevant to their teaching subjects will get the\nhigher scale on qualification basis without any restriction;\n(b) All existing Secondary School teachers who have improved\ntheir qualifications not relevant to their teaching subjects will be\nallowed the higher scale on qualification basis after five years'\nteaching counting from the date on which higher qualification\nwas obtained;\n\n(c) In future, school teachers will be allowed higher pay scale on\nqualification basis only when they obtain such higher\nqualification in the subject relevant to their\nteaching/appointment. (emphasis supplied)\n\n[See the Memo. Nos. 142-Edn. (B) dated 17th May, 1985, 52-\nEdn. (B) dated 14th February, 1992. Memo. Nos. 253-Edn.(B)\ndated 17th September, 1984 and 400-End.(B) dated 10th\nSeptember, 1991].\n\n137. The Education Department, Government of West Bengal in\n\npursuance of paragraph 3 of the Government Order No.372-Edn.(B) dated\n\n31st July, 1981 laid down the principles for fixation of pay of the teachers\n\nand non-teaching employees, in short, fixation of pay and option form.\n\n138. The said Rule provides for exercise of option and benefit of next\n\nhigher scale of pay in certain contingencies. It makes clear that the option\n\nonce exercised shall be final and cannot be modified at any subsequent\n\ndate. The consequences of non-exercising option is mentioned in Rule 4(3) of\n\nROPA 1981. The benefit of higher scale was made applicable only to those\n\nwhose pay shall be fixed in the revised scales of pay shown in serial nos. 1\n\nto 13 in annexure-II and only once in one's service career. It also takes care\n\nof stagnation pay in Rule 6 in relation to non-government employees whose\n\npay has been fixed in the revised scales of pay shown in serial no. 1 to 13 of\nannexure-II of Government Order No.372-Edn(b) dated 31st July, 1981 and\n\nwho reached the maximum of the respective scales of pay would continue to\n\ndraw increment beyond the maximum of the scale for 3 years at the rate of\n\nwhat was last drawn by him/her as increment before reaching the\n\nmaximum. It thus, shows that such benefit of increment was for a limited\n\nduration notwithstanding the length of service.\n\n139. At the time of exercising option the occupant of the post would\n\nbe required to file an option form as prescribed in annexure I.\n\n140. This was followed by ROPA 1990, actually effective from 1st\n\nJanuary, 1988 but notionally effective from 1st January, 1996. The scale of\n\npay of teachers and non-teaching staff was revised on the basis of the\n\nrecommendation of the Pay Commission. It was published on 7th March,\n\n1990. Similar provision with regard to option is mentioned in Clause 5 to be\n\nexercised within 90 days from the date of issue of the said order. However, a\n\nteacher or a non-teaching employee of a Government Aided/Sponsored\n\neducational institution who was in service on 31st December, 1995 may, at\n\nhis discretion, retain existing scale of pay and existing terms and conditions\n\nof service. The option shall not be admissible to any employee to a post\n\non/or after 1st January, 1996 for the first time in service.\n\n141. The stagnation increment is provided in Rule 8. It states that an\n\nemployee whose pay has been fixed in any of the revised scales of pay with\n\nthe maximum of rupees four thousand or below and who reaches the\n\nmaximum of the scale of pay shall continue to draw increment for\nstagnation beyond the maximum of the scale for a period of three years at\n\nthe rate last drawn by him as increment before reaching the maximum.\n\n142. The significant provision in ROPA 1990 is introduction of Career\n\nAdvancement Scheme (CAS) and related issues. Rule 16(3) provides for\n\nhigher scale of pay to all teachers and librarians of secondary schools who\n\nhave improved/will improve their qualifications or who were appointed with\n\nhigher qualification in the subjects or group relevant to their\n\nteaching/appointment appropriate to their qualifications with effect from 1st\n\nJanuary, 1986 or the date of improving qualification whichever is later.\n\n143. Clause 3 of the aforesaid Rule was substituted by the\n\nGovernment Order dated 10th September, 1991 in the manner following:\n\n(3) All teachers and librarians of secondary schools who will\nimprove their qualification in subjects relevant to their\nteaching/appointment shall get higher scale of pay appropriate\nto their qualification with effect from the date of improving\nqualification.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n144. The substituted Clause would show that the qualification\n\nshould be in relation to subjects relevant to their teaching and appointment\n\nand with effect from the date of improving qualification. He shall be placed\n\nin the next higher scale of pay, however his designation would remain\n\nunchanged. The CAS has further undergone a change in ROPA 1999 which\n\nbecame notionally effective from 1st January, 1996 and actually effective\n\nfrom 1st April, 1997. It was published on 12th February, 1999.\n145. The additional two increments under the Rule 16(2) was\n\nmodified by G.O. No.38-SE(B) dated 8th March, 1999 with the introduction\n\nof the following proviso which reads:\n\n\"Provided that the employees who have already got two\nadditional increments in the earlier pay revision will not get\nincrement further in the present revised scale and the\nemployees who have drawn only one increment in the earlier\nrevision for 10 (ten) years of service, will get one increment in\nthe present revised scale after completion of 20 (twenty) years\nof service.\". (emphasis supplied)\n\n146. However, on 13th July, 1999 sub-rule (3) of paragraph 12 was\n\nsubstituted and in the said substituted sub-paragraph the following proviso\n\nwas added to the sub-paragraph:\n\n\".....provided that such higher qualified teachers in the relevant\nsubjects or group is justified as per approved staff pattern of that\nschool if such teacher is appointed through West Bengal School\nService Commission, his/her pay will be fixed in the scale of pay as\nper his/her qualification mentioned by the West Bengal School\nService Commission\". (emphasis supplied)\n\n147. Moreover at the end of paragraph 8 which refers to the date of\n\nincrement in the Revised Scale the following line was inserted:\n\n\"increment in the revised scale of pay shall be drawn with\neffect from 1st day of the month in which it becomes otherwise\ndue\".\n\n148. By reason of the aforesaid amendment the entitlement to higher\n\nscale of pay now has to be justified as per approved staff pattern of that\nschool and if the appointment is through West Bengal School Service\n\nCommission then the pay will be fixed in the scale of pay as per his/her\n\nqualification mentioned by the West Bengal School Service Commission. In\n\nview of such substitution the staff pattern in respect of the relevant subject\n\nand qualification of the teacher mentioned by the West Bengal School\n\nService Commission has now become relevant considerations.\n\n149. However, there are few memoranda issued in between the time\n\nspecified above which inter alia, includes Government Order No.795 dated\n\n22nd November, 1993 with regard to scale of pay to the teachers of physical\n\neducation and Government Order No.796 dated 22nd November, 1993\n\nregarding higher scale of pay to the teachers and Government Order No.57\n\ndated 27th January, 1995 concerning granting of pay according to\n\nqualification to the assistant teachers of non-government Secondary\n\nSchools.\n\n150. In the first government order mentioned above i.e. 22nd\n\nNovember, 1993 it has been clarified that all physical education teachers\n\nhaving Master Degree in physical education from recognised Universities will\n\nbe entitled to higher scale of pay in relaxation of the earlier Government\n\nOrders.\n\n151. The Government Order No.796 of the same date clarified that\n\nall teachers in social science group and language and science group with\n\nhigher qualifications of post graduate degree or equivalent in relevant\n\nsubjects will get higher scale of pay in relaxation of the staff pattern\nmentioned in the earlier government orders and would be made effective on\n\nand from the said date. The aforesaid two government orders thus\n\nemphasised and extended financial benefit to teachers for acquiring higher\n\nqualification in the relevant subject.\n\n152. The government order dated 27th January, 1995 was in relation\n\nto granting of pay according to the qualification to the Assistant Teachers of\n\nNon-Government Secondary Schools allowing them higher scale of pay even\n\nif their initial appointments were in different group/subject and not to their\n\nrespective subject/group in which they were appointed but relevant to their\n\nrespective teaching subject in order to tide over the inconvenience caused to\n\nthe educational institutions due to non-sanctioning of the required number\n\nof additional posts to the schools owing to financial stringencies.\n\nConsidering such prevailing situation and in the academic interest of the\n\nschools it was provided that in the event such assistant teachers take\n\nindividually at least six such periods per week as officially allotted by the\n\nauthorities of the respective schools to such assistant teachers within the\n\nnormal workload upon the written consent of the concerned teacher and\n\nwith the prior permission of the concerned District Inspector of schools and\n\nstrictly according to the actual academic need of the individual school, the\n\nteacher shall be allowed to draw salary according to their respective higher\n\nqualifications as prescribed by the State Government. Thus it allows a\n\nteacher who has obtained higher qualification in subjects not relevant to\n\ntheir respective subject or group in which they were appointed in schools\n\nbut relevant to their respective teaching subjects to draw pay according to\ntheir respective higher qualification. The pay structure should be\n\ndetermined on the basis of higher qualification. This was purely an interim\n\narrangement.\n\n153. The Government felt the necessity to constitute a specialised\n\nbody to regulate recruitment of teachers a field, which had remained\n\nunregulated, undefined and open to misuse and manipulates of the\n\nManaging Committee and to bring transparency and uniformity in the\n\nrecruitment process enacted the\nWest Bengal School Service Commission\n\nAct, 1997\n, in short, \"the 1997 Act\".\n\n154. The 1997 Act was enacted to provide for the constitution of\n\nRegional School Service Commissions and a Central School Service\n\nCommission in the state. It defines in\nSection 2(p)\na \"teacher\" to mean an\n\nassistant teacher or any other person holding a teacher post of a school and\n\nrecognized as such by the Board or the Council or the Board of Madrasah as\n\nthe case may be and includes the headmaster or the headmistress.\nThe Act\n\nrequires the Managing Committee to appoint teachers on the\n\nrecommendation of the Regional Commission having jurisdiction. It is the\n\nduty of the Regional Commission to select persons for appointment to the\n\nposts of teacher in schools within its territorial jurisdiction.\n\n155.\nSection 17\nof the 1997 Act lays down the rule making power of\n\nthe State Government.\n\n156. The manner and procedure for selection of persons for\n\nappointment to the posts of Teachers shall be such as may be prescribed.\nThe Act\nmakes it very clear that any appointment of a teacher made on or\n\nafter the commencement of the 1997 Act dehors the provisions of the Act\n\nshall be invalid.\n\n157. On 3rd October, 1997 the School Service Commission Rules has\n\ncome into force.\n\n158. The aforesaid rules were framed in pursuance of\nSection 17(2)\nof\n\nthe 1997 Act.\nSection 17(2)(d)\ndeals with the manner and scope of selection\n\nof a person for appointment to the posts of teachers under Sub-\nSection 1\nof\n\nSection 8\n. Rule 7 requires the School Education Department to lay down the\n\nprocedure for recruitment of teacher, headmaster and head mistress\n\nincluding inter alia, the essential and/or desirable educational and other\n\nqualifications, age, experience and other requirements. Sub Rule 2 requires\n\nevery school to report the vacancies as on the date of report as may arise up\n\nto the second day of next January to the Regional Commission with a copy\n\nto the District Inspector of Schools (Secondary Education).\n\n159. The manner of distribution of staffs in different groups in\n\nschools is\nlaid down in\nthe Government Order No.670 dated 4th September,\n\n1998. The said government order has clearly defined the distribution of\n\nteaching staff in the Recognized non-Government Junior High School,\n\nJunior High Madrasah, High School, High Madrasah and High Secondary\n\nSchools (normal section).\n160. The said circular cancels the earlier Government Order No.642-\n\nSE(S)/vide no.1S-14/98 dated 20th August, 1998. It clarifies that Classes V\n\nto X in higher secondary school would be treated as normal section.\n\n161. On 8th March, 2000 the School Education Department issued a\n\ncircular in clarification of paragraph 3 of the Government Order No.795-\n\nEdn(s) dated 22nd November, 1993 granting benefit of higher scale of pay to\n\nthose physical education teachers who have obtained M.P.Ed. Degree on\n\ncompletion of 2 years regular course from a recognised University.\n\n162. In view of the fact that Honours Graduate candidates have to\n\ncompete with Post Graduate candidates in the test held by WBSSC and a\n\nsingle panel is prepared by WBSSC for the two sets of degree holders, on 3rd\n\nJune, 2002, the government issued the Order No.735-SE(S)/SP-132/2002\n\nclarifying that Honours Graduate teachers of Non-Govt. aided Secondary\n\nSchools including Madrasahs appointed through W.B.S.S.C. who have\n\n\"obtained post graduate degree in the subject relevant to their appointments\n\nprior to their date of joining in the school/Madrashas or who have\n\ncompleted their course of studies at Post Graduate level in the subject\n\nrelevant to their appointment or have appeared at the examination but\n\nresult of that examination was not published till the date of their joining\n\nmay be allowed higher scale of pay with effect from the date of joining or the\n\ndate following the last date of examination (both theoretical and practical)\n\nwhichever is later\". (emphasis supplied)\n163. The School Education Department subsequently revised the\n\naforesaid circular by Circular No. 134-SE(S) dated 3rd November, 2004 as\n\npresumably it faced difficulties in determining the date from which Post\n\nGraduate scale would be allowed to the eligible teachers on acquiring Post\n\nGraduate degree. The Government Order dated 3rd June, 2002 was replaced\n\nby the following paragraph:\n\n\"Upon due consideration of the above facts the Government in\nSchool Education Department has decided that Hons. Graduate\nteachers of Hons./Post Graduate category of Non-Govt.\nSecondary Schools including Madrasahs appointed through\nWest Bengal S.S.C. who obtained post graduate degree in\nsubject relevant to their appointment prior to their joining in\nschool/Madrasahs shall be eligible for Post Graduate scale of\npay from the date of joining. The Hons. graduate teachers of\nHons/Post Graduate category who have completed their\nexamination before joining but results were published after\njoining shall be deemed to have been eligible to get the Post\nGraduate scale of pay-from the date of publication of results of\nsuch Post Graduate degree relevant to their appointment. The\nHons, graduate teachers of Honours/Post Graduate category of\nNon-Govt Secondary aided schools including Madrasahs\nappointed through S.S.C. and who have improved or will\nimprove qualification after joining the posts with due permission\nfrom the authority competent to issue such permission, be\neligible for Post Graduate scale on successful results of the last\nexamination leading to the Post Graduate degree relevant to\ntheir appointment from the day following the last date of the\nexamination (both theoretical and practical). The other\nparagraphs and sentences of the G.O. remain unchanged. This\nwill come into force with immediate effect.\" (emphasis supplied)\n164. In view of the aforesaid Clause Honours graduate/Post graduate\n\nteachers (i) who obtained post graduate degree in the relevant subject prior\n\nto their joining would be entitled to post graduate scale of pay from the date\n\nof joining, (ii) who have completed their examination before joining but\n\nresults were published after joining shall be deemed to have been eligible to\n\nget the post graduate scale of pay from the date of publication of results of\n\nsuch post graduate degree, (iii) who have improved or will improve\n\nqualification after joining the posts with due permission from the authority\n\ncompetent to issue such permission would be eligible for post graduate scale\n\non successful results of the last examination leading to the post graduate\n\ndegree from the day following the last date of the examination (both\n\ntheoretical and practical).\n\n165. In order to regulate and exercise control over the Expenditure in\n\nthe schools in\nWest Bengal, the West Bengal School (Control and\n\nExpenditure) Act, 2005\nhas been enacted. The said Act was notified on 19th\n\nAugust, 2005.\n\n166. The statement of object and reasons of the 2005 Act clearly\n\ndefined and sets out in detail the reason for enactment of the said Act. The\n\nGovernment felt that the creation of post, approval of panels, appointment of\n\nteachers, regularization of service of teaching and non-teaching staff,\n\nsanctioning of higher scale to teachers on account of acquiring higher\n\nqualification in the Schools and the Madrassahs in the State of West Bengal\n\nand recognition and up-gradation, and expenditure for management\n\nrequires to be streamlined by a separate statute. The reason being that\nadministrative orders, directions and circulars that were in existence were\n\noften challenged in Courts causing huge financial burden on the State\n\nExchequer. It was enacted primarily and essentially for regulating and\n\ncontrolling the expenditure to be incurred out of the appropriate budgetary\n\nprovision.\n\n167. Henceforth, all the expenditure as sanctioned by the 2005 Act\n\nwould be only legally enforceable if there is any breach.\n\n168.\nSection 14\nof the said Act deals with the scale of pay and\n\nincidental matters in relation to a teacher.\n\n169. The said Section has three categories:\n\ni) Sub-\nSection 1\ndeals with post of under graduate teacher,\n\nii) Sub-\nSection 2\ndeals with post of graduate teacher; and\n\niii) Sub-\nSection 3\ndeals with honours graduate teacher.\n\n170. Sub-\nsection 1\nand\nclearly specifies that it is the post which is\n\nthe determining factor to decide the scale of pay. If a teacher is appointed in\n\nthe post as under graduate or pass graduate he would be entitled to draw in\n\nthe scale of pay in which he is appointed and shall not be entitled to claim\n\nany additional increment or higher scale of pay for acquiring any\n\nqualification other than qualification specified in such post. However, Sub-\n\nsection 3\nmakes a little departure as taking into consideration that the\n\nhonours graduate candidates have to compete with the post graduate\n\ncandidates on the same set of syllabus and same set of question papers in\n\nthe test held by WBSSC for selection of teachers and moreover a single\npanel is prepared in a subject from amongst the selected Honours and\n\nMaster Degree holders. It provides that if a teacher is appointed for the\n\nhonours or post graduate teacher category he would be entitled to draw pay\n\nof post graduate teacher category upon acquiring post graduate degree in\n\nthe manner as may be specified by order.\n\n171. This appears to be an amalgam of paragraph 12(3) of ROPA\n\n1998 as amended on 13th July, 1999 and Government order dated 3rd June,\n\n2002 as revised on 3rd November, 2004. Initially in terms of Memorandum\n\ndated 3rd June, 2002 the higher scale of pay would take effect from the date\n\nof joining or the date following the last date of examination (both theoretical\n\nand practical) whichever is later but by reason of the subsequent circular\n\ndated 3rd November, 2004 different dates have been mentioned.\nThe Act\nof\n\n2005 was followed by the order issued by the School Education Department\n\non 26th December, 2005 specifying the date from which the Honours or Post\n\ngraduate teacher can claim higher scale of pay. They are:\n\n\"a) such teacher has, prior to joining the post, acquired Post-\n\ngraduate degree in the subject relevant to the appointment shall\nbe entitled to draw pay of Post-graduate teacher category from\nthe date of joining the post: or\n\n(b) such teacher has, prior to joining the post, completed the\nexamination for the Post- graduate degree in the subject\nrelevant to the appointment, but the results of such\nexamination has been published after joining the post, shall be\nentitled to draw pay of Post- graduate teacher category from the\ndate of publication of the results of such examination; or\n\n(c) such teacher has, after joining the post improved his\nqualification with prior permission of the authority competent to\ngrant such permission, shall, on being successful in the results\nof the examinations (theoretical and practical) for the Post-\ngraduate degree in the subject relevant to the appointment, be\nentitled to draw pay of Post-graduate teacher category from the\nday next following the last day of such examinations.\"\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n172. This government order was issued under Sub-\nsection 3\nof\n\nSection 14\nand in supersession of all order on the subject. If the aforesaid\n\norder is read in conjunction with the order dated 3rd June, 2002 it would\n\nappear that 3rd June, 2002 has been restored.\n\n173. This continued till 27th November, 2007 when a government\n\nOrder was published specifying the manner in\n\nwhich a teacher appointed in an honours graduate/post graduate scale of\n\npay would be entitled to claim additional increment and higher scale of pay\n\nupon acquiring post graduate/or any higher diploma/degree under\nSection\n\n14(3)\nof the West Bengal Schools (Control and Expenditure Act, 2005) and\n\nother related issues.\n\n174. For the sake of convenience Clause 1 to 9 of the said circular is\n\nreproduced below:\n\n\"1. All the teachers teaching in different State Aided Schools will\nhave to take prior permission from the Managing Committee/Ad\nhoc Committee/Administrator as the case may be to enrol\nthemselves and to appear for any examination for enhancement of\neducational qualification. The Managing Committee being\n'Competent Authority in such cases will take a decision in its next\nmeeting and convey its decision to the teacher concerned\nimmediately. A copy of the decision of the Managing Committee\nwill be forwarded to the office of the Dl of Schools (SE) of the\nconcerned district.\n\n2. The applicant-teacher thereafter, will, if necessary, apply for\nLeave/Special Leave/ Study Leave as the case may be (along with\nthe resolution of Managing Committee), to the West Bengal Board\nof Secondary Education (which is the Competent Authority in this\ncase) through the Managing Committee of the School.\n\n3. The teacher is required to seek prior permission of concerned\nDistrict Inspector of Schools (SE) (only when he/she wants to\nclaim additional increment/higher scale of pay etc. for obtaining\nsuch higher qualification) through the Managing Committee of the\nSchool.\n\n4. Provided further that no such permission can be granted on any\nground to any teacher who has entered the service/joined the\nschool with Graduate Degree and with a graduate scale of pay.\n\n(Any Managing Committee of any school recommending such case\nin future and/or any District Inspector of Schools granting such\nprayer will be treated as un 'Offender' under\nWest Bengal Schools\n(Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005\n).\n\n5. The courses to be studied should be relevant to the subjects\nstudied in Under Graduate Honours/Post Graduate Course of the\nApplicant Teacher and none other. The Deemed\nUniversity/University etc. conducting the examination must be\naffiliated to UGC.\n\n6. Prayers from teachers who have already secured higher\nqualification observing the procedure mentioned above and who\nhave submitted his/her claim to concerned District Inspector of\nSchools with a complete set of papers like certificate, resolution of\nManaging Committee etc. before the introduction of\nWest Bengal\nSchools (Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005\nmay be considered only\nby the District Inspectors of Schools (SE) with the approval of\nDirector of School Education, West Bengal only after examining\nthe staffing pattern, vacancy positions etc. of the school\nconcerned.\n\n7. No such prayer for higher scale of pay from any teacher with\nGraduate Degree and Graduate scale of pay at the time of entry\ninto service/joining the schools will be entertained no matter\nwhether he/she has secured this higher qualification before or\nafter introduction of\nWest Bengal Schools (Control of Expenditure)\nAct, 2005\n.\n\n8. Henceforth no permission will be accorded for securing higher\nqualification for obtaining higher scale of pay to any Assistant\nTeacher and/or to any Assistant Teacher over 50 years of age\nserving in any Junior High School or any school respectively,\n\n9. This order will replace all earlier orders published in this matter\nbefore the date of coming into effect of\nWest Bengal Schools\n(Controls of Expenditure) Act, 2005\n. 1595- SE(S) dated 26.12.2005\nalso stands modified.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n175. Our attention is drawn to amendment made to\nSection 14\nin\n\n2016 and 17th April, 2017 which are not much relevant in deciding the\n\npresent issue.\n\n176. Significantly the recital in the government order dated 26th\n\nDecember, 2005 and 27th November, 2007 are different. The reference of His\n\nExcellency the Governor is significantly absent in the recital of 27th\n\nNovember, 2007.\n\n177. There are two distinct category of cases forming the subject\n\nmatter of the reference. The first category of cases related to teachers who\nwere appointed as pass graduate and thereafter acquired higher\n\nqualification before the 2005 Act came into force.\nThe Act\nof 2005 does not\n\nhave any retrospective effect. The executive order of dated 27th November,\n\n2007 cannot override the statutory rules framed under\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution of India having received the assent of the Governor. The\n\nGovernment Order of 27th November, 2007 is subservient to the 2005 Act. It\n\nis elementary that the Rule cannot make itself look larger than life and\n\nnullify the Act. It owes its existence to the principal act which permits\n\nframing of rules for the purposes mentioned in the Act.\n\n178. Under the garb of rule making power the provisions of the Act\n\ncannot be amended. The executive order dated 27th November, 2007 in Rule\n\n9 cannot override all the earlier circulars by reason of which the permission\n\nmay not be required or already granted prior to the said executive order and\n\nhave been acted upon. It cannot extend the embargo under the Act\n\nretrospectively. All the circulars permitting financial benefits by increment\n\nor acquiring higher degree are required to be decided on the basis of the Act\n\nin the context of the relevant circulars operating in the field prior to the\n\nExpenditure Act, 2005 coming into force. Amending rules cannot have any\n\nretrospective operation, even if the rule contemplates consideration of an\n\napplication for a period prior to the said rules coming into force. A statute\n\nmust be read reasonably and not in a manner which results in absurdity\n\nand hardship. The eligibility of a candidate should be on the basis of the\n\nrules existing at that time. The statutory authorities and the applicants are\n\nexpected to follow the law as it stood thence. The authority cannot be\nexpected to take any action on the pre-supposition that the rule would be\n\namended.\n\n179. In case of any conflict between the government order dated 26th\n\nDecember, 2005 and order dated 27th November, 2007 it is needless to\n\nmention that the order dated 26th December, 2005 shall prevail. In fact, the\n\ngovernment order of 26th December, 2005 was issued in exercise of power\n\nunder\nSection 14(3)\nof the 2005 Act. Although, it has been argued that for\n\nthe purpose of making rules the assent of the Governor is not required and\n\ninadvertently it has been mentioned that \"The Governor is pleased hereby to\n\nspecify\" in the earlier Government order all the applications pending prior to\n\n27th November, 2007 are required to be decided on the basis of the Rules\n\nexisting during the interregnum period and any benefit accrued cannot be\n\ntaken away. Moreover, the Secretary School Education Department has\n\nadmitted that the said G.O. No.593-SE(B) dated 27th November, 2007 has\n\nnot been published in the \"Kolkata Gazette Extraordinary\" and hence cannot\n\nhave any statutory force.\n\n180. The right to claim higher scale of pay by any teacher with\n\nHonours Graduate Degree at the time of entry prior to 27th November, 2007\n\nwould be decided on the basis of the guidelines and circulars existing on the\n\ndate of his appointment. The service conditions and benefits of such\n\nteachers are protected by the earlier Government Orders/Rules which have\n\nbeen issued under the relevant statute and/or rules framed under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India.\n181. A teacher appointed after the promulgation of the\nWest Bengal\n\nSchool Service Commission Act, 1997\nwould be entitled to higher scale of\n\npay provided he has acquired such qualification in the relevant subject and\n\nthe staff pattern permits appointment of a teacher with higher qualification.\n\n182. The requirement of a prior permission before the introduction of\n\nthe Control of Expenditure Act, 2005 would not be rigidly interpreted\n\nparticularly when the Managing Committee has granted permission to the\n\nteacher concerned for acquiring higher qualifications in the relevant subject\n\nwithout affecting his duties as a teacher of the institution. The District\n\nInspector of Schools shall not deny the benefit of higher scale of pay merely\n\non the ground of failure to obtain prior permission if the DI School is\n\nsatisfied that it is within the staff pattern and the school shall be benefited\n\nby the reason of the teacher acquiring higher qualification. They are also\n\nrequired to be guided by the Order No.735-SE(S)/SP-32/2002 as revised by\n\nthe Circular No.134-SE(S) dated 3rd November, 2004.\n\n183. A teacher who has entered service in the pass graduate category\n\nshall not be entitled to higher scale of pay merely because he has acquired\n\nhigher qualification subsequent thereto or prior to his appointment.\n\nSimilarly, a teacher with the post graduate degree, if applied, as a pass\n\ngraduate candidate and appointed in the pass graduate category shall not\n\nbe entitled to claim higher scale of pay after his appointment. The reason\n\nbeing that a teacher with the post graduate/honours degree ought to have\n\ncompeted with candidates having post graduate/honours degree and\n\nallowing any increment or higher scale of pay to such a teacher who has\nentered the service in the pass graduate category in spite of being an\n\nHonours graduate or Post graduate would allow back door entry thereby\n\ndepriving deserving candidates with higher qualifications.\n\n184. A teacher with Honours Graduate degree shall be entitled to\n\npost graduate scale of pay upon acquiring a post graduate degree without\n\nthere being a requirement of any prior permission as the Honours graduate\n\nand post graduate degree under\nSections 14(3)\nof the Act of 2005 read with\n\nthe Government Order no. 1595-SE(S) dated 26th December, 2005 are\n\ntreated alike. The justification is stated in the Government Order no. 735-\n\nSE(S)/SP-132/2022 dated 3rd June, 2002. The Government Order no.\n\n1595-SE-(s) dated 26th December, 2005 will have prospective effect. Clause\n\n9 of the Government Order no. 593-SE(B) dated 27th November, 2007 shall\n\nnot be a bar. All teachers who are otherwise covered by the earlier\n\nregulations and/or notification and/or orders issued under\nWest Bengal\n\nSchool Service Commission Act, 1997\nand scale of pay has been fixed\n\nand/or revised shall continue to receive such benefits and shall not be\n\ndeprived of any financial benefit solely based on the Government Order\n\ndated 27th November, 2007 since the said order in any event can only be\n\napplied prospectively. Any teacher pursuing higher education prior to the\n\nintroduction of Control of Expenditure Act, 2005 shall be entitled to ex post\n\nfacto approval for a higher scale of pay provided the Managing Committee\n\nhas granted permission and the staff pattern permits a teacher with higher\n\nqualification in the relevant subject, on the basis of the Government Order\n\ndated 3rd June, 2002 as revised by the Circular dated 3rd March, 2004.\n185. In exceptional circumstances the claim of a teacher for a higher\n\nscale of pay even where the Managing Committee has not forwarded the\n\napplication with its resolution may be considered. It is clarified that if the\n\nteacher could demonstrate that he has taken all reasonable steps expected\n\nof him for obtaining prior permission from the District Inspector and the\n\nManaging Committee is responsible for the delay in forwarding the request\n\nfor permission to the District Inspector shall consider the application on the\n\nbasis of the circular or Government Order existing on the date of application\n\nIn absence of any guideline which the District Inspector of School is\n\nrequired to follow in the event it is found that a teacher before joining the\n\ninstitution was already pursuing higher studies or has completed post\n\ngraduate degree but for some unavoidable reasons permission as\n\ncontemplated under the Government Order dated 27th November, 2007\n\ncould not be obtained, the Government Order dated 27th November, 2007\n\nshall not stand in the way. The District Inspector shall consider such\n\nrepresentation on merits. The reason for denying higher scale of pay could\n\nbe that already there are sufficient number of teachers having Honours/\n\nPost Graduate degree on the said subject in the institution and in such\n\ncircumstances payment of higher scale of pay would be a burden on the\n\nexchequer. The State should have due regard to the fact that a person with\n\nhigher qualification would be expected to have better knowledge in the\n\nsubject and the students are likely to be benefited by reason of his acquiring\n\nsuch higher qualification. The date relevant for the purpose of conferring\n\nhigher financial benefits would be the date of publication of result and not\nconvocation, that is, the ceremonial conferment of the degree. A teacher is\n\nentitled to higher scale of pay once the result is published and the\n\nconvocation shall relate back to the date of the result. Any other\n\ninterpretation would be harsh, absurd and arbitrary.\n\n186. If a teacher has been recommended by the School Service\n\nCommission for appointment as an assistant teacher under pass graduate\n\ncategory he cannot be sanctioned post graduate scale of pay upon acquiring\n\npost graduate qualification subsequent to his date of appointment in view of\n\nGovernment Order no. 155-SE(B) dated 13th July, 1999 read with Section\n\n14(b) of the Control and Expenditure Act, 2005 unless his/her claim is\n\ncovered by the Order No.735-SE(S)/SP-32/2002 as revised by the Circular\n\nNo.134-SE(S) dated 3rd November, 2004. The aforesaid Government order\n\nhas clearly stated that in such case the scale of pay shall be fixed in terms\n\nof the educational qualification which is mentioned by the School Service\n\nCommission in the recommendation order. In justification we find it\n\napposite to mention that if a teacher is permitted to upgrade his pay scale\n\nbased on higher qualification obtained after his appointment which is on\n\nrecommendation of the School Service Commission; it will encourage\n\ncandidates to resort to unfair means to get themselves enriched by higher\n\nscale of pay bypassing the method of selection meant for appointment of\n\nteachers under post graduate/honours graduate category at the entry level\n\nby non-disclosure or suppression of higher degree. This appears to be the\n\nreason for amending 12(3) of ROPA 1999. However, claim for increments\nand not higher scale of pay may be considered by the District Inspectors of\n\nSchools concerned, it would likely to benefit the students.\n\n187. One of the ways to ascertain the applicability of the Government\n\nOrder dated 27th November, 2007 in relation to candidates who were\n\npursuing higher studies prior to the said circular would be to find out how\n\nthe executive authorities interpreted the provision of the Act or the Rules\n\nframed thereunder. In fact they have framed the Rules. They are the\n\nimplementing authority and inextricably connected with the framing and\n\nimplementing of the Rule.\n\n188.\nIn\nDebala Das v. State of West Bengal (W.P. No.26009(W\n) of\n\n2014) the Deputy Director of School Education was considering sanction of\n\na Higher scale of pay in respect of Smt. Debala Das, Assistant Teacher of\n\nGopimohanbarh Girls High School, P.O.- Bhagwanpur, Dist- Purba\n\nMedinipur. She joined as an Assistant Teachers in Hons/Post Graduate\n\ndegree. The decision was:\n\n\"As Smt. Debala Das has joined as an A.T. in Hons/P.G.\nCategory, she is entitled to draw post graduate scale of pay for\nhaving M.Sc. degree in Physics, her relevant teaching subject in\nlight of West Bengal Schools (Control of Exp.) Act 2005 and in\nterms of G.O.No. 1595-SE(S) dt. 26.12.2005.\n\nAs the teacher concerned has partially completed her study\nbefore entering service she would come under purview of G.O.\nNo. 1595-SE(S) dt. 26.12.2005. Question of taking permission\nfrom D.I.S (SE) concerned may not be applicable here.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n189. The said decision was taken on 22nd June, 2016. It thus, clearly\n\nshows that for all teachers who were pursuing and/or completed their\n\nhigher studies prior to the Government Order of 27th November, 2007 would\n\nbe covered by the Government Order dated 26th December, 2005 and would\n\nbe entitled to higher scale of pay upon acquiring higher degree which is in\n\nconsonance with our understanding and interpretation.\n\n190. Consistency and predictability are the hallmark of a sustainable\n\nlegislation and good governance. The rules have undergone changes with\n\ntime essentially to address the needs of the time. However, we have not\n\ncome across rules where financial benefits extended to teachers under\n\nvarious Government orders are being curtailed or withdrawn in\n\ncorresponding statutes. To illustrate after the 1997 Act has come into force\n\nthe pay structure and benefits of higher scale of pay for acquiring higher\n\nqualification under ROPA 1998 was not immediately changed.\n\n191. The rules made by the Governor in exercise of its power under\n\nproviso to\narticle 309\nare statutory in nature and irrespective of the fact\n\nwhether it is prospective or retrospective, are open to challenge on the\n\nground of violation of the Constitution including the Fundamental rights\n\nenshrined in part III of the Constitution.\n\n192.\nIn\nTejshree Ghag & Ors. v. Prakash Parashuram Patil &\n\nOrs.\nreported in (2007) 6 SCC 220, it has been ruled that:\n\n\"12. ......the State has the power to alter the terms and\nconditions of service even with retrospective effect by making\nrules framed under [the] proviso appended to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution of India, but it is also well settled that the rule so\nmade ordinarily should state so expressly.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n193.\nIn\nMarripati Nagaraja & Ors. v. Government of Andhra\n\nPradesh & Ors.\nreported in (2007) 11 SCC 522, the Supreme Court has\n\nruled that:\n\n\"16. the State, in exercise of its power conferred upon it under\nthe proviso appended to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India,\nis entitled to make rules with retrospective effect and retroactive\noperation. Ordinarily, in absence of any rule and that too a rule\nwhich was expressly given a retrospective effect, the rules\nprevailing as on the date of the notification are to be applied.\nBut if some rule has been given a retrospective effect which is\nwithin the domain of the State, unless the same is set aside as\nbeing unconstitutional, the consequences flowing therefrom\nshall ensue. In such an event, the applicable rule would not be\nthe rule which was existing but the one which had been validly\nbrought on the statute book from an anterior date.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n194. Francis Bennion's Statutory Interpretation, 7th Edn.,\n\nprovides an insight as to the presumption of retrospective legislation. The\n\nlearned author has stated thus:\n\n\"The essential idea of a legal system is that current law\nshould govern current activities. If we do something today,\nwe feel that the law applying to it should be the law in force\ntoday, not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it. [(\nSolar\nCentury Holdings Ltd. v. Secretary of State\nfor Energy\nand Climate Change (2014) EWHC 3677 (Admin) at 92]\nWe believe that the nature of law is such that '... those who\nhave arranged their affairs.... in reliance on a decision\nwhich has stood for many years should not find that their\nplans have been retrospectively upset.\n\n[(\nEWP Ltd v Moore\n\n(1992 QB 460 at 474)]\n\nThe principle is sometimes expressed in the maxim lex\nprospicit non respicit law looks forward not back. [Jenk\nCent 284. See also 2 Co Inst 292].\nAs Willes J said in\nPhillips v Eyre [(1870) LR 6 QB 1 at 23.] retrospective\nlegislation is 'contrary to the general principle that\nlegislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be\nregulated ought, when introduced for the first time, to deal\nwith future acts, and ought not to change the character of\npast transactions carried on upon the faith of the then\nexisting law. (See also Anthlumney, Re, ex p Wilson\n[1898] 2 QB 547) (emphasis supplied)\n\n195. The basis of the principle against retrospectivity is 'no more\n\nthan simple fairness, which ought to be the basis of every legal rule'. (See\n\nL'Office Cherifien des Phosphates v Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship\n\nCo Ltd., 1994(1) AC 486)\n\n196. Having cautioned against undue or mechanistic reliance on\n\ngeneralised presumptions Lord Mustill then went on to address the question\n\nof how the courts approach the question of what simple fairness demands:\n\n\"Precisely how the single question of fairness will be answered\nin respect of a particular statute will depend on the interaction\nof several factors, each of them capable of varying from case to\ncase. Thus, the degree to which the statute has retrospective\neffect is not a constant. Nor is the value of the rights which the\nstatute affects, or the extent to which that value is diminished\nor extinguished by the retrospective effect of the statute. Again,\nthe unfairness of adversely affecting the rights, and hence the\ndegree of unlikelihood that this is what Parliament intended,\nwill vary from case to case. So also will the clarity of the\nlanguage used by Parliament, and the light shed on it by\nconsideration of the circumstances in which the legislation was\nenacted. All these factors must be weighed together to provide a\ndirect answer to the question whether the consequences of\nreading the statute with the suggested degree of retrospectivity\nare so unfair that the words used by Parliament cannot have\nbeen intended to mean what they might appear to say.\n\nHe then went on to list factors relevant to reaching his decision,\nincluding the value and nature of the rights affected, the\npurpose of the legislation and the hardship of the result.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n197. Despite the general principle, there is no doubt that Parliament\n\ndoes have power to introduce a retrospective effect. Moreover, this approach\n\nis sometimes justifiable, particularly when things have gone wrong. As\n\nFuller explained:\n\n'It is when things go wrong that the retroactive statute often\nbecomes indispensable as a curative measure; though the\nproper movement of law is forward in time, we sometimes have\nto stop and turn about to pick up the pieces'.\n\n198. A policy decision taken by the Government is not liable to\n\ninterference, unless the court is satisfied that the rule making authority has\n\nacted arbitrarily or in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under\nArticle 14\nand\n16.\n(See\nK Narayana v. State of Karnataka\n; AIR 1994 SC\n\n55).\n\n199. Plethora of decisions on either side has been relied upon of\n\nwhich we have decided to consider few to avoid duplication and\n\nmultiplication of authorities. The decisions are:\n\ni) Bhagwan Dass & Ors v. State of Haryana & Ors.\n, reported in\n\n1987 (4) SCC 634 is a case concerning equal pay for equal work.\n\nThe issue was whether temporary appointees and employees in\n\nregular cadre in the same Government department if are\n\nperforming similar duties although by different selection process\n\nor that the appointment or scheme under which appointments\n\nhave been made are temporary would be entitled equal pay.\n\nPrimarily the issue was with regard to the right of a temporary\n\nemployee to claim equal pay for equal work at par with permanent\n\nemployees. The said judgment recognised the right of a\n\ntemporary employee to claim equal pay only after discharging the\n\nburden of proving similarly in the nature of work.\n\nii) The principle of equal pay for equal work depends upon pay\n\nstructure as observed in\nState of Bihar & Ors. v. Bihar\n\nSecondary Teachers Struggle Committee, Munger & Ors.\n,\n\nreported in 2019(18) SCC 301. The relevant consideration and\n\nfactors are stated thus:\n\"102. We must also consider observations of this Court in\nparagraph 12 in its decision in\nSecretary, Finance Department\nand Ors. v. West Bengal Registration Service Association and Ors.\n\n1993 Supp (1) SCC 153, which bring out how a 'pay structure' is\nevolved. The relevant portion of said paragraph was:\n\n\"12. ......Ordinarily a pay structure is evolved keeping in mind\nseveral factors, e.g., (i) method of recruitment, (ii) level at which\nrecruitment is made, (iii) the hierarchy of service in a given\ncadre, (iv) minimum educational/technical qualifications\nrequired, (v) avenues of promotion, (vi) the nature of duties and\nresponsibilities, (vii) the horizontal and vertical relativities with\nsimilar jobs, (viii) public dealings, (ix) satisfaction level, (x)\nemployer's capacity to pay, etc. We have referred to these\nmatters in some detail only to emphasise that several factors\nhave to be kept in view while evolving a pay structure and the\nhorizontal and vertical relativities have to be carefully balanced\nkeeping in mind the hierarchical arrangements, avenues for\npromotion, etc. Such a carefully evolved pay structure ought not\nto be ordinarily disturbed as it may upset the balance and\ncause avoidable ripples in other cadres as well.\" (emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n103. We, therefore, have to proceed on the following basic\n\npremise:\n\n103.1 It was open to the State to have two distinct cadres\nnamely that of 'Government Teachers' and 'Niyojit Teachers'\nwith Government Teachers being a dying or vanishing cadre.\nThe incidents of these two cadres could be different. The idea\nby itself would not be discriminatory.\n\n103.2. The pay structure given to the Niyojit Teachers was\ndefinitely lower than what was given to Government\nTeachers but the number of Government Teachers was\nconsiderably lower than the number of Niyojit Teachers. As\nstated above, presently there are just about 66,000\nGovernment Teachers in the State as against nearly 4 lakh\nNiyojit Teachers. There is scope for further appointment of\nabout 1 lakh teachers which could mean that as against 5\nlakh teachers the number of State Teachers would\nprogressively be going down.\n\n103.3. The parity that is claimed is by the larger group with\nthe lesser group as stated above which itself is a dying or a\nvanishing cadre.\n\n103.4. The mode of recruitment of Niyojit Teachers is\ncompletely different from that of the Government Teachers as\nstated above.\n\n104. If a pay structure is normally to be evolved keeping in mind\nfactors such as \"method of recruitment\" and \"employer's capacity\nto pay\" and if the limitations or qualifications to the applicability\nof the doctrine of 'equal pay for equal work' admit inter alia the\ndistinction on the ground of process of recruitment, the stand\ntaken on behalf of the State Government is not unreasonable or\nirrational. Going by the facts indicated above and the statistics\npresented by the State Government, it was an enormous task of\nhaving the spread and reach of education in the remotest corners.\nFurthermore, the literacy rate of the State which was lagging far\nbehind the national average was also a matter which required\nattention. The advances made by the State on these fronts are\nquite evident. All this was possible through rational use of\nresources. How best to use or utilise the resources and what\nemphasis be given to which factors are all policy matters and in\nour considered view the State had not faltered on any count. As\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court in the decisions in Joginder Singh 1963\nSuppl. 2 SCR 169 and Zabar Singh (1972) 2 SCC 275, the State\nwas justified in having two different streams or cadres. The\nattempt in making over the process of selection to Panchayati Raj\nInstitutions and letting the cadre of State Teachers to be a dying\nor vanishing cadre were part of the same mechanics of achieving\nthe spread of education. These issues were all part of an\nintegrated policy and if by process of judicial intervention any\ndirections are issued to make available same salaries and\nemoluments to Niyojit Teachers, it could create tremendous\nimbalance and cause great strain on budgetary resources.\n\n105. It is true that the budgetary constraints or financial\nimplications can never be a ground if there is violation of\nFundamental Rights of a citizen. Similarly, while construing the\nprovisions of the\nRTE Act\nand the Rules framed thereunder, that\ninterpretation ought to be accepted which would make the Right\navailable Under\nArticle 21A\na reality. As the text of the Article\nshows the provision is essentially child-centric. There cannot be\ntwo views as regards the point that Free and Compulsory\nEducation ought to be quality education. However, such premise\ncannot lead to the further conclusion that in order to have quality\neducation, Niyojit Teachers ought to be paid emoluments at the\nsame level as are applicable to the State Teachers. The modalities\nin which expert teachers can be found, whether by giving them\nbetter scales and/or by insisting on threshold ability which could\nbe tested through examinations such as TET Examination are for\nthe Executive to consider.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\niii) In\nChaman Lal & Ors. v. State of Haryana\n, AIR 1987 SC\n\n1621 the appellants were all trained graduates that is to say, all of\n\nthem possessed the B.Ed or B.T degree in addition to the B.A.\n\ndegree. They were teachers in government schools in the State of\nHaryana. They did not possess the B.Ed and B.T degree when they\n\njoined service initially. They acquired the B.Ed and B.T degree\n\nsubsequent to their joining service which was between the years,\n\n1953 and 1973. Some of them acquired B.Ed and B.T degree\n\nbefore September 5, 1979 and in some cases after 5th September,\n\n1979. In Haryana Educational Service, there were two categories\n\nof teachers described as Masters and Basic Trained teachers. 25%\n\nof the posts of Masters were reserved for promotion from the post\n\nof basic trained teachers. Masters could be promoted to higher\n\nposts. There was a pay revision of the pay scales present to an\n\norder dated 23rd July, 1957 all teachers according to their\n\nqualification were placed in two broad categories.\n\n\"Category A :\n\nRs. 110-8-190/10-250 with a higher start for MA & M.Sc.\n\nas at present. The existence percentage of posts fixed by\n\nGovernment for scales of Rs.110-8-190/10-250 and\n\nRs.250-300 should remain unchanged at 35% and 15%\n\nrespectively.\n\nCategory B :\n\nLower Rs.60-4-80/5-120, Middle Rs.120-5-175, Upper\n\nRs.140-10-200.\nWith a view to providing incentives, it has been decided\n\nthat posts falling in these groups should be in the\n\nfollowing as G Group I: Lower Scale 85% Middle Scale\n\n15%.\n\n15% of teachers in this group should straightway be\n\npromoted to the middle scale by a selection based on\n\nseniority and merits, while the rest should be given the\n\nlower scale.\"\n\nIt was noticed that a scale of pay was linked to the qualification. The\n\nquestion arose whether teachers who started as Basic Trained Teachers and\n\nlater acquired the B.Ed or BT. Qualifications, but who could not be adjusted\n\nagainst posts of Masters would be entitled to the grade of Rs.110-250 which\n\nwas earmarked for category A. On consideration of the recommendation of\n\nthe Kothari Commission which, inter alia, had strongly expressed the view\n\nthat the scale of pay should be linked to the educational qualification and\n\nincentives to teachers of special subject or to teachers with additional\n\nqualifications can be given in the form of advance increment or special\n\nallowances expressed the view that the teachers acquiring BT or B.Ed\n\nqualification would become entitled to higher scale of pay. The Honourable\n\nSupreme Court in deciding the issue has taken into consideration paragraph\n\n3.16 of the Kothari Committee recommendation which states:\n\n\"Our attention has been drawn to an anomaly which must be\nremoved as early as possible, several States restrict, on financial\ngrounds, the number of posts which carry the scale of trained\nteachers who have completed the secondary school course. The\nremaining posts are usually assigned to lower scales of pay\nsanctioned for teachers with lower qualifications. Not infrequently,\npersons with lower qualifications are recruited to these posts even\nwhen qualified and trained teachers are available. This is bad\nenough; but what is worse, even trained and qualified teachers\nwho are recruited against the posts are given, not the salaries of\nqualified and trained teachers to which they are entitled but the\nlower salaries meant for these posts. As the completion of\nsecondary school course and two years of professional training\nare accepted as the minimum qualification for a primary teacher,\nthis practice should be abandoned as early as possible and the\nprinciple adopted that every trained teacher who has completed\nthe secondary school course received the scale of pay sanctioned\nfor such teachers. This will remove an injustice now being done to\na large number of teachers in service, and create an incentive for\nunqualified or untrained teachers to become qualified and\ntrained.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\niv) In Pubjab Higher Qualified Teachers Union & Ors. v. State of\n\nPubjab & Ors., reported in AIR 1988 SC 892 the issue was\n\nwhether the matriculate junior basic trained teachers falling under\n\ncategory B group II would be entitled to higher scale of pay upon\n\nacquisition of higher educational qualification of B.A., B.T/B.A,\n\nB.Ed etc. The circular dated 23rd July, 1957 was taken into\n\nconsideration. Paragraph 3 of the said circular was in relation to\n\nrevision of pay scales of teachers under two distinct categories.\n\nCategory A and category B inter alia, laid down the requirements\n\nof academic qualifications with respect to each. On interpretation\nof paragraph 3 it was observed that the revision of pay of teachers\n\nwas based on the principle of linking pay to qualification. The\n\nKothari Commission strongly expressed the view that the scales of\n\npay of teachers should be linked to educational qualifications. On\n\nconsideration of the relevant clauses it was held:\n\n\"12. As a matter of plain construction, we are quite clear in\nour mind that Graduate Teachers form a class by themselves\nand cannot be subjected to the further requirement of having\nJST/JAV training. The words 'plus JAV training' clearly\nqualify the word 'Matric' and relate only to Matriculate JBT\nTeachers. Such a classification for revision of pay satisfies\nthe touchstone of\nArt. 14\nand would render the action of the\nState Government in seeking to discriminate between\nGraduate Teachers with JST/JAV training and Graduate\nTeachers with or without such training, impermissible as the\nattempt is to create a class within a class without any\nrational basis.\"\n\nThe contention of the petitioner that they are entitled to higher\n\npay on acquiring or improving their academic qualifications has\n\nbeen upheld.\n\nv) In\nState of Gujarat & Anr. v. Ramanlal Keshav Lal Soni &\n\nOrs.\n, reported in 1983 (2) SCC 33 a Constitution Bench of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court was considering retrospective operation of\n\na statute in relation to the legal rights of the persons likely to be\n\naffected by reason of an amendment giving retrospective\n\noperation. The Constitution Bench of the Court considered the\nquestion whether the status of ex-ministerial employees who had\n\nbeen allocated to the Panchayat service as Secretaries, Officers\n\nand Servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats under the\nGujarat\n\nPanchayat Act, 1961\nas government servants could be\n\nextinguished by making retrospective amendment of the said Act\n\nin 1978.\n\nThe aforesaid matter involves the status of employees of various\n\nmunicipalities whose services were to a Single Centralized\n\nPanchayat Service as distinct from the \"State Service\". The\n\nPanchayat service consisted of district cadre, Taluqa cadre and\n\nlocal cadre (vide Order dated 2nd January, 1967 made under\n\nSection 203\nof the Act). The Taluqa and District Development\n\nOfficers were officers of the State Government. The Gujarat\n\nPanchayat Service (Absorption, Seniority, Pay and Allowances)\n\nRules, 1965 were not made effectively applicable unless\n\nequivalence of posts was first determined by Government Order.\n\nAlthough benefits relating to equation of posts, promotions,\n\nfixation of pay scales and revision thereof (which were made on\n\nthe basis of the recommendations of Pay Commissions) were\n\nextended to the District and Taluqa cadres, the State Government\n\ndid not make any order in that regard for the staff in the local\n\ncadre. The ex-Municipal employees included in the local cadre\n\nthereupon also filed a writ petition before the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt challenging the constitutional validity of the\nAmending Act\n.\nThe facts and the issues have been briefly summarized in\n\nparagraph 50 and 51 of\nthe said judgment\nwhich reads:\n\n\"50. It is here necessary to recapitulate a few facts. When\nthe Panchayat Service was initially constituted soon after the\npassing of the gujarat\nPanchayats Act\n, there were three\ncadres, the district cadre, the taluqa cadre and the local\ncadre. Secretaries, officers and servants of the old village\npanchayats under the Bombay Village Panchayats Act, 1958\nbecame Secretaries, Officers and servants of the new Gram\nPanchayats under\nSection 325 (2)(x)\nof the Gujarat\nPanchayats Act, 1961. Talatis and Kotwals, who were\nGovernment servants were Secretaries and officers of the old\nvillage panchayats under the Bombay Village Panchayats\nAct and so they became secretaries and officers of the new\ngram panchayats under the\nGujarat Panchayats Act, 1963\n.\nSome municipalities constituted for municipal districts and\nmunicipal boroughs under the Bombay District Municipal Act\nand the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act as applied to areas\nin the State of Gujarat, were converted into gram and nagar\npanchayats under\nSection 307\nof the Gujarat Panchayats Act\nand all officers and servants in the employ of such\nmunicipalities became officers and servants of interim\npanchayats and allocated to the Panchayat Service. Thus,\nSecretaries and Officers of dissolved municipalities also\nbecame Secretaries and officers of gram and nagar\npanchayats. District Local Boards constituted under the\nBombay Local Boards Act stood dissolved on the passing of\nthe\nGujarat Panchayats Act\nand all officers and servants in\nthe employment of the Board were deemed to be transferred\nto the service of the successor district panchayat under\n\nSection 326\nof the Gujarat Panchayats Act. Also allocated to\nthe Panchayat Service were those Government servants who\nwere transferred to the Panchayats under Section 157 and\nsuch others officers and servants employed in the State\nService as were necessary (Section 206(iii)). All these\nSecretaries, officers and servants became members of a\nservice under the State as soon as they were allocated the\nPanchayat Service. Now, by the\nAmending Act\n, secretaries,\nofficers and servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats who\nwere allocated to the Panchayat service from the ranks of the\nex-municipal employees are sought to be meted out\ndifferential treatment from the other members of the\nPanchayat Service, more particularly the Secretaries, officers\nand servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats who were\ndrawn from the ranks of secretaries, officers and servants of\nold village panchayats, that is the Talatis and Kotwals. Their\nstatus as members of a service under the State is to go with\nno option to them. Retrospectivity is sought to be given to the\namending act so that they could not claim that they were\never Government servants and so could not be made to cease\nto be Government servants and so that they could not claim\nthat they were singled out for differential treatment, for, if\nthey were never in the Panchayat Service, they could not\ncomplain of being taken out of the Panchayat Service.\n\n51. Now, in 1978 before the\nAmending Act\nwas passed,\nthanks to the provisions of the Principal Act of 1961, the ex-\nmunicipal employees who had been allocated to the\nPanchayat Service as Secretaries, Officers and servants of\nGram and Nagar Panchayats, had achieved the status of\ngovernment servants. Their status as Government servants\ncould not be extinguished, so long as the posts were not\nabolished and their services were not terminated in\naccordance with the provisions of\nArticle 311\nof the\nConstitution. Nor was it permissible to single them out for\ndifferential treatment. That would offend\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution. An attempt was made to justify the purported\ndifferentiation on the basis of history and ancestry, as it\nwere. It was said that Talatis and Kotwals who became\nSecretaries, officers and servants, of Gram and Nagar\nPanchayats were Government servants, even to start with,\nwhile municipal employees who became such secretaries,\nofficers and servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats were\nnot. Each carried the mark or the 'brand' of his origin and a\nclassification on the basis of the source from which they\ncame into the service, it was claimed, was permissible. We\nare clear that it is not. Once they had joined the common\nstream of service to perform the same duties, it is clearly not\npermissible to make any classification on the basis of their\norigin. Such a classification would be unreasonable and\nentirely irrelevant to the object sought to be achieved. It is to\nnavigate around these two obstacles of\nArticle 311\nand\n\nArticle 14\nthat the\nAmending Act\nis sought to be made\nretrospective, to bring about an artificial situation as if the\nerstwhile municipal employees never became members of a\nservice under the State. Can a law be made to be destroy\ntoday's accrued constitutional rights by artificially reverting\nto a situation which existed seventeen years ago? No.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nStriking down the said amendment on the ground that it\noffended\nArticles 311\nand\nof the Constitution, the Court\nsaid:\n\n\"52. The legislation is pure and simple, self-deceptive, if we\nmay use such an expression with reference to a legislature-\nmade law. The legislature is undoubtedly competent to\nlegislate with retrospective effect to take away or impair any\nvested right acquired under existing laws but since the laws\nare made under a written Constitution, and have to conform\nto the do's and don'ts of the Constitution neither prospective\nnor retrospective laws can be made so as to contravene\nFundamental Rights. The law must satisfy the requirements\nof the Constitution today taking into account the accrued or\nacquired rights of the parties today.\n\nThe law cannot say, twenty years ago the parties had no\nrights, therefore, the requirements of the Constitution will be\nsatisfied if the law is dated back by twenty years. We are\nconcerned with today's rights and not yesterday's. A\nlegislature cannot legislate today with reference to a\nsituation that obtained twenty years ago and ignore the\nmarch of events and the constitutional rights accrued in the\ncourse of the twenty years. That would be most arbitrary,\nunreasonable and a negation of history. It was pointed out\nby a Constitution Bench of this Court in B.S. Yadav and\nOrs. etc. v. State of Haryana and Ors. etc. (1981 )ILLJ\n280 SC Chandrachud CJ., speaking for the Court held:\n\n\"Since the Governor exercises the legislative power under\nthe proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution, it is open to\nhim to give retrospective operation to the rules made under\nthat provision. But the date from which the rules are made\nto operate, must be shown to bear either from the face of\nthe rules or by extrinsic evidence, reasonable nexus with\nthe provisions contained in the rules, especially when the\nretrospective effect extends over a long period as in this\ncase\".\n\nToday's equals cannot be made unequal by saying that they\nwere unequal twenty years ago and we will restore that\nposition by making a law today and making it retrospective.\nConstitutional rights, constitutional obligations and\nconstitutional consequences cannot be tempered with that\nway. A law which if made today would be plainly invalid as\noffending constitutional provisions in the context of the\nexisting situation cannot become valid by being made\nretrospective. Past virtue (constitutional) cannot be made to\nwipe out present vice (constitutional) by making retrospective\nlaws. We are, therefore, firmly of the view that the\nGujarat\nPanchayats (Third Amendment) Act, 1978\nis unconstitutional,\nas it offends\nArticles 311\nand\nand is arbitrary and\nunreasonable. We have considered the question whether any\nprovision of the\nGujarat Panchayats (Third Amendment) Act,\nmight be salvaged. We are afraid that the provisions\nare so intertwined with one another that it is well-nigh\nimpossible to consider any life saving surgery. The whole of\nthe\nThird Amendment Act\nmust go. In the result the Writ\nPetition Nos. 4266-70 are allowed with costs quantified at\nRs. 15,000. The directions given by the High Court, which we\nhave confirmed, should be complied with before June 30,\n1983. In the meanwhile, the employees of the Panchayats\ncovered by the appeal and the Writ Petitions will receive a\nsum of Rs. 200 per month over and above the emoluments\nthey were receiving before February 1, 1978. This order will\nbe effective from February 1, 1983 The interim order made\non February 20, 1978 will be effective upto January 31,\n1983. The amounts paid are to be adjusted later.\"\n\nIt has been categorically stated that the amendment cannot\ngo against the object of the principal Act.\n\nThe said decision in Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni (1983) 2\nSCR 287 of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court\nhas been followed by various Division Benches of the Apex\nCourt. (\nK.C. Arora v. State of Haryana\n(1984) 3 SCR 623;\n\nT.R. Kapur v. State of Haryana\n(1987) 1 SCR 584];\nP.D.\nAggarwal v. State of U.P.\n(1987) 3 SCR 427];\nK.\nNarayanan v. State of Karnataka\n1994 Supp (1) SCC\n44];\nUnion of India v. Tushar Ranjan Mohanty\n(1994) 5\nSCC 450] and K. Ravindranath Pai v. State of\nKarnataka 1995 Supp (2) SCC 246).\n\nvi) A Constitution Bench in\nChairman, Railway Board and Ors. v.\n\nC.R. Rangadhamaiah and Ors.\nAIR 1997 SC 3828: 1997 (6)\n\nSCC 582, dealt with the case where the pension admissible under\n\nthe Rules in force at the time of retirement was introduced with\n\nretrospective effect. The Court held such an action to be\n\nunreasonable and arbitrary being violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. The Court observed as under:\n\n\"20. It can, therefore, be said that a rule which operates in\nfuture so as to govern future rights of those already in\nservice cannot be assailed on the ground of retroactivity as\nbeing violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution,\nbut a rule which seeks to reverse from an anterior date a\nbenefit which has been granted or availed of, e.g.,\npromotion or pay scale, can be assailed as being violative\nof\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution to the extent it\noperates retrospectively....\n\n24. In many of these decisions the expressions \"vested\nrights\" or \"accrued rights\" have been used while striking\ndown the impugned provisions which had been given\nretrospective operation so as to have an adverse effect in\nthe matter of promotion, seniority, substantive\nappointment, etc., of the employees. The said expressions\nhave been used in the context of a right flowing under the\nrelevant rule which was sought to be altered with effect\nfrom an anterior date and thereby taking away the\nbenefits available under the rule in force at that time. It\nhas been held that such an amendment having\nretrospective operation which has the effect of taking away\na benefit already available to the employee under the\nexisting rule is arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of\nthe rights guaranteed under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nIt is now well settled that accrued rights cannot be taken\naway by repealing the statutory provisions arbitrarily.\nMore so, the repealing law must provide for taking away\nsuch rights, expressly or by necessary implication.\n\nThe said decision was in turn followed in\nThe Vice\nChairman, Delhi Development Authority v. Narender\nKumar & Ors.\n, reported in 2022 (1) SCC 641 in\nparagraph 35, which reads:\n\n\"35. Several previous judgments of this Court dealing\nwith the question that what is accrued or vested right\nwere considered in\nChairman, Railway Board v.\nC.R. Rangadhamaiah\n1997 Supp (3) SCR 63\nwherein the impugned Rule in question sought to\ndisturb the method of calculating the last pay drawn\nfor the purposes of pension and related allowances.\nThis impacted the pension disbursement of a large\nnumber of employees who had retired much earlier.\nThe court observed that the amendments applied to\nemployees who had already retired and were no\nlonger in service on the date the impugned notifications\nwere issued, and adversely impacted the pension they\nwere drawing. In such context the court held as\nimpermissible, those benefits which accrued or in other\nwords had been actually enjoyed and were taken\naway by the devise of giving retrospective effect to the\nrule.\n\nvii) In M.P. Rural Agriculture Extension Officers Association v.\n\nState of M.P. & Anr., reported in 2004 (4) SCC 646 the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court observed that two different pay scales can be\n\nprovided in the same cadre on the basis of educational\n\nqualification even if nature of work is the same and the post are\n\ninterchangeable. It reiterated that the recommendation of the pay\n\ncommission is not binding on the State and cannot be enforced by\n\nissuing a writ in the nature of mandamus. State can make rules in\n\nexercise of power under proviso to\nArticle 309\ncontrary to the\n\nrecommendation by evolving policy decision and give the same\n\nretrospective effect. It has categorically stated that a valid\n\nclassification can be made on the basis of educational\n\nqualification.\n\nIn the instant case a policy decision has been taken to extend\n\nfinancial benefits upon acquiring higher qualification subject to\n\nfulfilment of certain criteria which inter alia, includes prior\n\npermission and staff pattern of the school. The said policy decision\nis based on past experience and the financial capacity and ability\n\nto meet expenses encompassed in the Act of 2005.\n\nThere is a rational basis for\nthe said decision\n. It is trite law that\n\nArticle 14\ndoes not forbid a reasonable classification.\nArticle 14\n\nforbids class legislation but permits reasonable classification\n\nsubject to the conditions that it is based on an intelligible\n\ndifferentia and that the differentia must have a rational nexus to\n\nthe object sought to be achieved. Constitutional interpretation is a\n\ndifficult task. Its concept varies from statute to statute, fact to\n\nfact, situation to situation and subject matter to subject matter.\n\n[See\nM.P. Rural Agriculture Extension Officers Association\n\n(supra)]\n\nviii) In\nCouncil of Scientific and Industrial Research & Ors. v.\n\nK.G.S. Bhatt\nreported in AIR 1989 SC 1972 it was held that\n\nwhen any bye law restricts promotion of employee, then it shall be\n\nliable to be set aside. The issue before the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nwas whether the respondent was entitled for promotional benefit.\n\nThe bye-law governed only promotion of junior scientific and\n\ntechnical staff grade-II who are engaged in scientific work. One\n\nwho was engaged in scientific work was alone entitled to benefit of\n\nthe bye-law. The respondent no.1 had suffered and stagnated for\n\nabout twenty years in same scale from inception due to defective\n\npromotional policy. It was on such consideration the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court did not interfere with the relief granted by the\nTribunal and agreed with the views expressed on scope of bye-law\n\n71(b)(ii) which exclude any person under the \"administrative\n\ncategory\".\n\nix) In\nO.Z. Hussain v. Union of India & Ors.\n, reported in AIR 1990\n\nSC 311 the issue was with regard to the parity in payment and\n\navailability of promotional avenues. The writ petitioners alleged\n\ndiscriminatory treatment meted out to Scientists of non-medical\n\nwing of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. From the evidence,\n\nit transpired that promotional avenues were available to similar\n\nofficers in other Ministries. On such consideration the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court disposed of the application filed under\nArticle 32\n\nof the Constitution of India with a direction upon the respondent\n\nauthorities to frame Rules providing for promotional avenues.\n\nx) J.S. Yadav vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. reported in\n\n2011 (6) SCC 570 has laid down two principles namely i) vested\n\nright can be taken away only if the law specifically or by necessary\n\nimplication provides for such a course and ii) the legislature has\n\nthe competence to unilaterally alter conditions of service with\n\nretrospective effect. Although legislature is so competent but\n\nintention of the legislation to apply amended provision with\n\nretrospective effect must be evident from the amendment Act itself\n\nexpressly or by necessary implication. Moreover the aforesaid\n\npower of legislator is qualified to the effect that such unilateral\n\nalteration should be in conformity with legal and constitutional\nprovisions. Any right accrued under the Act/ordinance which\n\nstood repealed would continue to exist unless they have\n\nspecifically or by necessary implication been taken away by the\n\nrepealing Act. The judgment recognised that the amendment with\n\nretrospective operation can be declared ultra vires when it takes\n\naway the vested right of the petitioners.\nIn paragraph 25 of the\n\nsaid decision the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to its earlier\n\njudgment in\nP.D. Aggarwal v. State of UP\nreported in 1987(3)\n\nSCC 622 para 18 in which it was held as under:\n\n\"18. ...the Government has power to make retrospective\namendments to the Rules but if the Rules purport to take away\nthe vested rights and are arbitrary and not reasonable then such\nretrospective amendments are subject to judicial scrutiny if they\nhave infringed\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\"\n\nWe may also refer to paragraph 27 and 29 of\nthe said judgment\n\nwhere the limitation to retrospective operation of a statute was\n\nconsidered and discussed:\n\n\"27. This Court in\nState of Punjab v. Bhajan Kaur\n(2008) 12\nSCC 112, while dealing with the provision of\nSection 6\nof\nthe 1897 Act, held as under:\n\n'9. A statute is presumed to be prospective unless held to be\nretrospective, either expressly or by necessary implication.\nA substantive law is presumed to be prospective. It is one of\nthe facets of the rule of law\n10. ....Where a right is created by an enactment, in the\nabsence of a clear provision in the statute, it is not to be\napplied retrospectively\".\n\nxi) In Dist.\nInspector of Schools Kolkata vs. Abhijit Baidya\n\nreported in 2013 (3) CHN (Cal) 711 the Full Bench of this Court\n\nwas considering the amendment of para 17 of ROPA 1990. The\n\nquestion was whether employees have to be given an opportunity\n\nto switch over from CPF-cum-Gratuity to Pension-cum-Gratuity\n\nScheme in view of the amendment and the retrospective effect of\n\nthe amendment was under consideration. It was noticed that the\n\nparagraph 13 of ROPA 1998 is similar to paragraph 17(2) of ROPA\n\n1990. The ratio of the decision is that the amendment of\n\nsubstitution with retrospective effect cannot take away the right\n\naccrued under existing para 17(2) of ROPA 1990. Any change of\n\ngovernment policy must be in conformity with reasonableness and\n\nprinciple of natural justice is required to be followed. The\n\nquestions answered by the Special Bench are mentioned in\n\nparagraph 9:\n\ni) Whether a person who has opted for revised pay scale\nunder ROPA, 1990 becomes entitled to pension by virtue of\noperation of para 17 of ROPA 1990?\n\nii) Whether an incumbent who has exercised an option\nunder ROPA 1990 can still be conditioned to the rider of\noption to be exercised under W. Ben. Recognised Non-\nGovernment Educational Institution Employees DCRB\nScheme, 1981, particularly in view of the amendment\neffected in paragraph 17(2) vide G.O. 226-SE (B)/1M-\n\n102/98, dated 16th May, 2007 and whether the\namendment made in paragraph 17(2) can be said to be\nvalid law; that too with retrospective effect?\n\niii) Whether para 13 of Revision of Pay & Allowance Rules\n1998, as amended by Notification dated 13th July, 1999\nrelating to the employees of W. Ben. Recognized Non-\nGovernment Aided Institutions can be said to be valid in\nlaw?\n\niv) Whether after amending the para 13 of ROPA 1998 on\n13.07.1999 and para 17 of ROPA 1990 in 2007, it was\nnecessary to give fresh opportunity to employees to revise\noption under W. Ben. Recognized Non-Government\nEducational institution Employees (Death-cum-Retirement\nBenefit) Scheme, 1981?\n\nv) Whether the time-limit fixed under the DCRB Scheme,\n1981 to submit option can be extended in suitable cases?\n\nThe answer is given in paragraph 74 in the following manner:\n\n\"1) An employee who has opted for revised pay scale under\nROPA, 1990 becomes entitled to pension and gratuity by\nvirtue of operation of para 17 of ROPA 1990. It was not\nnecessary for him to exercise fresh option as per Memo\ndated 16th December, 1991, which was applicable to\nemployees who had not opted for ROPA 1990. Benefit of\nPension-cum-Gratuity was conferred due to acceptance of\nreduced age of superannuation of 60 years under para\n17(1) of ROPA 1990 and his right for Pension-cum-Gratuity\nso accrued could not have been taken away retrospectively\nby substitution of the provisions of para 17 in 2007 or by\nsubstitution of para 13 of ROPA 1998 in 1999.\n\n2) Once option has been exercised under ROPA 1990, a\nperson cannot be subjected to the rider of the option\nexercised under the DCRB Scheme, 1981 as the invitation\nof the option under the said Scheme was with respect to the\nemployees who elected to continue in service till the age of\n65 years and to have the benefit of the old scheme. For\nsuch employees, opportunity was given to submit fresh\noptions as per Memo dated 16th December, 1991.\n\nThe amendment made in para 17(2) of ROPA 1990 on May\n16, 2007 cannot be said to be valid piece of law as such\nprovisions cannot be substituted with retrospective effect to\ntake away the rights already accrued to an employee. So as\nto validate provisions of para 17(2) of ROPA 1990, as\nsubstituted, it was necessary to invite option for switching\nover to Pension-cum-Gratuity from CPF-cum-Gratuity when\nthe substitution of para 17(2) of ROPA 1990 was made on\n16th May, 2007 with retrospective effect.\n\n3) Para 13 of the ROPA 1998 as amended on 13th July,\n1999 cannot be said to be valid in the eye of law as it has\nthe effect of taking away benefit conferred by para 17(2) of\nROPA 1990, as the ROPA 1998 was made applicable to the\nemployees who had opted for ROPA 1990 and the benefit\nconferred could not have been taken away by substitution\nof provisions contained in para 13 of ROPA 1998. It was\nclearly arbitrary and an unreasonable exercise of power and\nto treat it as valid and legal, it was necessary to invite fresh\noption under the DCRB Scheme, 1981 for switching over to\nPension-cum-Gratuity as the provisions had been amended\ndrastically which could not operate to the prejudice of the\nemployees in whose favour right to claim Pension-cum-\nGratuity had accrued. The substituted provisions of para\n13 of ROPA 1998 fail to qualify Wednesbury principles of\nreasonableness. The action was in utter violation of fair\nplay and justice.\n\n4) In our opinion, after substitution of para 13 of ROPA\n1998 on 13th July, 1999 and para 17 of ROPA 1990 on\n16th May, 2007, in order to save the provisions from the\nvice of arbitrariness, it was necessary to give an opportunity\nto the employees to submit fresh option under DCRB\nScheme, 1981. As the option exercised earlier in terms of\nthe DCRB Scheme, 1981 was made applicable, it was\nnecessary to give fresh opportunity to exercise an option for\nswitching over to Pension-cum-Gratuity and the State could\nnot have acted to the detriment of the employees opting for\nROPA 1990 who chose the rider of reduced age of\nsuperannuation i.e. 60 years under para 17(1) of ROPA\n1990.\n\n5) In our opinion, as there was drastic change of provisions\nof para 17(2) of ROPA 1990 made by way of substitution in\n2007, and ROPA 1998 also interfered with the rights\nconferred upon the employees under para 17(2) of ROPA\n1990, all the employees who opted for ROPA 1990 ought to\nbe given fresh opportunity to submit the option to switch\nover to Pension-cum-Gratuity\".\n\nxii) In\nShrimanta Kumar Mondal & Ors. v. The State of West\n\nBengal & Ors.\n, 1998(2) CHN 276 (Cal), the Special Bench of this\n\nCourt had approved the view expressed in Gopalji Sahu v. State of\n\nBihar, CWJC no.1409 of 1991(R) in which it was held that laying\ndown the qualification of a teacher in order to maintain the standard of\n\neducation in an institution is permissible by way of executive\n\ninstruction.\n\nAs to the power of the State to specify a date with effect\n\nfrom which a rule or regulation can be made applicable, the Special\n\nBench in paragraph 75 of the report relied upon the decision of our\n\nCourt in\nThe State of West Bengal vs. Ratan Behari De\nreported in\n\nCalLT 1994(1)SC 8; 1993 LAB IC 2199 in which it was held:\n\n\"In this context, it may be remembered that the power of the State\nto specify a date with effect from which the regulations framed, or\namended, as the case may be, shall come into force is\nunquestioned. A date can be specified both prospectively as well\nas retrospectively. The only question is whether the prescription of\nthe date is unreasonable or discriminatory. Since we have found\nthat the prescription of the date in this case is neither arbitrary\nnor unreasonable, the complaint of discrimination must fail.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nxiii) In\nUnion of India & Ors. v. M.V. Manohar Nair\nreported in\n\n2020 (5) SCC 421 the Hon'ble Supreme Court was considering\n\nwhether Modified Assured Career Progression Scheme envisaged\n\nfinancial upgradation to next grade pay or to grade pay of next\n\npromotional post. In deciding the said issue, role of expert body\n\nprescribing pay scale and incentives was also considered. The\n\nApex Court observed that the object behind the MACP Scheme is\n\nto provide relief against the stagnation. If the arguments of the\n\nRespondents are to be accepted, they would be entitled to be paid\n\nin accordance with the grade pay offered to a promotee; but yet\nnot assume the responsibilities of a promotee which would have\n\nan adverse impact on the efficiency of administration.\n\nThe change in policy brought about by supersession of ACP\n\nScheme with the MACP Scheme was after consideration of all the\n\ndisparities and the representations of the employees. The Sixth\n\nCentral Pay Commission is an expert body which has\n\ncomprehensively examined all the issues and the representations\n\nas also the issue of stagnation and at the same time to promote\n\nefficiency in the functioning of the departments, the MACP\n\nScheme has been introduced which has been accepted by the\n\nGovernment. After accepting the recommendation of the Sixth\n\nCentral Pay Commission, the ACP Scheme was withdrawn and the\n\nsame was superseded by the MACP Scheme with effect from 1st\n\nSeptember, 2008. When the government has accepted the\n\nrecommendations of the pay commission and also implemented\n\nthose, any interference by the Court would have serious impact on\n\npublic exchequer. Also when an expert body like the pay\n\ncommission had comprehensively examined all issues and\n\nrepresentations the court should not interfere with the\n\nrecommendations of the expert body.\n\nThe prescription of Pay Scales and incentives are matters where\n\ndecision is taken by the Government based upon the\n\nrecommendation of the expert bodies like Pay Commission and\n\nseveral relevant factors including financial implication and court\ncannot substitute its views. The court should approach such\n\nmatters with restraint and interfere only when the court is\n\nsatisfied that the decision of the Government is arbitrary. Even in\n\na case where the court takes the view that order/Scheme passed\n\nby the Government is not an equitable one, ordinarily only a\n\ndirection could be given to the State Government or the authority\n\nfor consideration of the matter and to take a decision. In the\n\npresent batch of cases where the Respondents have been claiming\n\nfinancial upgradation in the grade pay of promotional hierarchy,\n\nno ground have been made out to show that the MACP Scheme\n\ngranting financial upgradation in the next grade pay is arbitrary\n\nand unjust; warranting interference.\n\nxiv) In\nDDA v. Narendra Kumar\n; 2022(11) SCC 641 the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court was considering Modified Assured Career\n\nProgression Scheme (MACP Scheme) introduced in supersession\n\nof ACP Scheme with retrospective effect. The issue was whether\n\nemployees who had completed eligibility for financial upgradation\n\nunder ACP Scheme can insist that such upgradation ought to be\n\nonly under ACP Scheme and not MACP Scheme. The Apex Court\n\nheld that it is well settled that Central Government in exercise of\n\nlegislative power conferred under\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution\n\ncan frame Rules having force of law with retrospective effect,\n\nhowever, where such retrospective application has the effect of\n\nnullifying or refacing intervening events or invalidating benefits\ngranted to employees the same can be declared unconstitutional.\n\nFactually it was found that none of the employees had actually\n\nearned second financial upgradation though undoubtedly they\n\nhad become eligible for consideration. The eligibility ipso facto\n\ncannot translate into entitlement having regard to the ACP\n\nScheme, i.e., such eligibility was mere expectation. The benefits\n\nunder the ACP/MACP scheme were only incentives not embodied\n\nin rules, to relieve stagnation and its continued existence cannot\n\nbe turned as enforceable right.\n\nxv) In\nFood Corporation of India & Ors. v. Bhartiya Khadya\n\nNigam Karmachari Sangh & Anr.\nreported in 2012 (2) SCC\n\n307 the issue was grant of incentive of two increments to in-\n\nservice employee on acquiring prescribed additional qualification\n\nand denial of same to those who had already acquired same\n\nqualifications before entering into service. It was argued that the\n\nsaid classification is unreasonable and violates\nArticle 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. The said issue was answered in\n\nparagraph 11 to 17:\n\n\"11. It is trite law that\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution, which\nenshrines the principle of equality, is of wide import. It guarantees\nequality before the law and equal protection of the laws within the\nterritory of India. It implies right to equal treatment in similar\ncircumstances, except in cases where the two persons form 'a\nseparate and distinct class and such classification is a\nreasonable one based on intelligible differentia having nexus with\nthe object sought to be achieved'.\n\n(See:\nState of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar\n: (\n1952) SCR\n284 and John Vallamattom and Anr. v. Union of India\n: (2003)\n6 SCC 611).\n\n12. Before examining the issue at hand on the touchstone of the\naforesaid principle envisaged in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution, it\nwould be apposite to refer to the relevant portions of the Circular\ndated 29th July, 1985. These read as follows:\n\n\"The Food Corporation of India, since its inception, has been\npursuing the policy of Management Development by providing\nsuitable training facilities both within the Corporation as well as\nby nominating its employees to short-term professional courses,\nwork-shops, seminars, conferences etc. organized by leading\nmanagement institutions in India and abroad.\n\n2. These efforts can get an uplift and possibly be supplemented to a\ngreat extent by the involvement of its employees in acquiring\nprofessional management qualifications on their own. In order,\ntherefore, to fill the basic gaps to acquire knowledge, the matter has\nbeen under consideration for introducing suitable incentive scheme\nfor motivating the employees of the Corporation to encourage them\nto acquire professional qualifications for rapid career advancement\nand enabling the Corporation to build a reserve of qualified\nprofessionals from within to back up key positions and to improve\nthe overall performance and efficiency of the organization. This will\nfurther create an atmosphere of 'professionalism' in the working of\nthe Corporation. With this end in view it has been decided with the\napproval of the Board of Directors to introduce the following\nincentive scheme with effect from 1st April, 1984.\n3. The following courses of study have been approved for grant of\nthe two increments as indicated in subsequent pages:\n\n(a).\n\n(b) High professional qualifications viz. MBA, ACA, AMIE, LLB, BL,\nACS etc. All the above courses (Diplomas/Degrees) should be at\nleast of two years duration.\n\n4. The following are the details of the scheme for grant of incentive:\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\nAll regular employees of the Corporation would be eligible for benefit\nunder the Scheme subject to the following terms and conditions:\n\n(i) The scheme would apply to all regular employees of the\nCorporation except deputationists/those employed on contract\nbasis/ casual or on tenure basis.\n\n(ii) Employees covered under (i) above should have acquired or may\nacquire higher professional qualifications from recognised\ninstitutions/ Universities during the course of their service in the FCI\nwith prior permission from the competent authority of the\nCorporation. The acquisition of said qualification should be useful to\nthe Corporation in its operations.\n\n(iii)-(viii)\n\n(ix) In cases where the employees, who join the higher post under\ndirect recruitment and where for such higher post the prescribed\nminimum qualification is the same as acquired by the employee\nwhile in the lower post, the incentive already granted to him/her in\nthe lower post would not be allowed to continue on his/her\nappointment to the higher post.\n\nINCENTIVE ADMISSIBLE:\nEmployees fulfilling the eligibility conditions\nreferred to above\nwould\nonly be entitled to the benefits under the scheme. The incentives\noffered under this Scheme would be in the form of two special\nincrements as 'personal pay', to be merged in pay at the time of\npromotion to the next higher grade. This incentive would be\nadmissible only on written orders by the competent authority on\nmerit of each case. The incentive in the form of two increments\nwould be granted starting from first day of the following month\nwhen the employee concerned has been declared to have passed\nthe listed Courses or the date of enforcement of this scheme\nwhichever is later.\n\nENTITLEMENT:\n\nIn order to overcome the administrative difficulties and financial\nimplications in implementation of the Scheme with retrospective\neffect covering all the cases of eligible employees who might have\nacquired such higher management or professional qualifications\nprescribed in this Scheme once or more than once in the past and\nmight be holding higher post on promotion or direct recruitment\nwithin the Corporation, the employees would be entitled to the\nincentive under this scheme with effect from 1.4.1984 only. Eligible\nemployees would be entitled to draw incentive increments at the\nrates applicable to their present pay scales. Arrears of incentive\nincrements shall be payable.\n\nIn the case of past cases, eligible employees should apply within six\nmonths from the date of the Scheme is circulated. In case of\nemployees who may acquire any of the above qualifications\nhereafter, they may apply as and when they acquire the higher\nqualifications in the prescribed Proforma enclosed.\n\n13. It is manifest from a bare reading of the above-mentioned\nportions of Circular that the fundamental objective of the Circular is\nto provide an incentive to the in-service employees in order to\nmotivate and encourage them to acquire professional qualifications\nin various courses, spelt out in the Circular, for their career\nprogression and at the same time enable the FCI to build a reserve\nof qualified professionals from within the organisation to back up\nkey positions. Evidently, the incentive will not only improve their\noverall performance and efficiency in the organisation, but also, in\nthe final analysis would strengthen the management with the\nadvent of an atmosphere of professionalism in the FCI.\n\n14. Our attention was also drawn to Circular No. 27 of 2000, dated\n11th September, 2000, empowering the competent authorities to\ngrant higher start/advance increments to newly recruited\nemployees at par with the pay drawn in their previous employment\nbefore joining the FCI. It is therefore, plain that the provision to\ngrant extra benefit to a new recruit possessing higher qualifications\nwas already in existence. It is also pertinent to note that the said\nCircular and the benefit which is sought to be given under any of\nthe Circulars\n,\nreferred to above\n, is not assailed by the Respondents.\n\nTheir only grievance is that there is no justification in depriving the\npersons, who already possess the higher qualifications from the\nbenefit of extra incentives, which are being granted to the in-house\nemployees.\n\n15. We are of the opinion that bearing in mind the aforesaid fact\nsituation and the objective sought to be achieved by issuance of the\nsaid Circular, there is substantial merit in the stand of the FCI. The\nclassification adopted by the FCI is between an employee obtaining\na higher qualification after joining service and an employee who\nalready possessed such qualification before joining the service. As\naforesaid, the main purpose of this classification is to grant an\nincentive to the employees already in service in the FCI to motivate\nthem to acquire higher qualifications for their own benefit as well as\nof their employer viz. the FCI. We are convinced that the\nclassification sought to be made by the FCI between the two sets of\nemployees bears a just and rational nexus to the object sought to be\nachieved by introducing the said incentive scheme. Judged from\nthis point of view, in our opinion, grant of the incentive in relation to\nthe in-service employees, in no way amounts to discrimination\nbetween the in-service employees and the employees recruited with\nhigher qualification, offending either\nArticles 14\nor 16 of the\nConstitution, particularly when the incentive is in the form of a\nspecial increment as 'personal pay' to be merged in pay at the time\nof promotion to the next higher grade and thus, having no bearing\non the inter-se seniority and/or to the future promotion to the next\nhigher grade.\n\n16. The decisions of this Court in\nB. Manmad Reddy and Ors. v.\nChandra Prakash Reddy and Ors.\n(\nsupra) and Food Corporation of\nIndia and Ors. v. Ashis Kumar Ganguly and Ors.\n(supra), on which\nreliance was placed by Learned Counsel for Respondents are\nclearly distinguishable on facts inasmuch as these decisions deal\nwith cases relating to employees being classified into separate\ncategories for the purpose of promotion on the basis of the source\nfrom which they were drawn and increments being given only to the\nCentral Government employees on being absorbed into the\ncorporation respectively, which is not the case here. However, it is\nimportant to note that in both these cases, it was observed that the\ndoctrine of equal pay for equal work is not an abstract doctrine.\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution permits reasonable classification\nbased on qualities or characteristics of persons recruited and\ngrouped together, as against those who are left out. Courts should\ninterfere with the administrative decisions pertaining to pay fixation\nand pay parity only when they find such a decision to be\nunreasonable, unjust and prejudicial to a section of employees and\ntaken in ignorance of material and relevant factors.\n17. At this juncture, it would be profitable to refer to the decision of\nthis Court in H.P. Gupta and Anr. (supra), which is on all fours to\nthe fact situation in the present appeal. In the said case, grant of\ntwo advance increments to Telecom Officers who acquired\nEngineering degree while in service and not to those who possessed\nsuch degree at the time of joining the service was held to be\nconstitutionally valid. Dealing with a similar controversy, the Court\nobserved as follows:\n\nThe object of giving two advance increments to those officials\nwho did not possess degree in Engineering before joining the\nservice, is only to encourage them to get such a degree so that\nthey could improve themselves while in service. When that\nobject is satisfied, the contentions that there should be equality\nin the matter of payment of salary or other emoluments or that\nthere should be parity in the matter of giving increments, cannot\nbe accepted. It is true that in such a situation, certain anomalies\nmay arise in specific cases when the official who has acquired\ndegree in Engineering subsequent to joining of service may get\nhigher salary though junior to those who possessed the\nqualification of degree in Engineering even at the time of joining\nthe service. There cannot be perfect equality in any matter on an\nabsolute scientific basis and there may be certain inequities\nhere and there. If the classification is correct and serves a\nparticular purpose, the same is not to be judicially interfered\nwith.\n\nWe deferentially concur with the observations in the afore-extracted\npassage.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n200. The careful reading of the aforesaid paragraph would show that\n\nthe objective of the circular was to provide an incentive to the in-service\n\nemployee in order to motivate and encourage them to acquire professional\nqualification and to create a reserve of qualified professionals from within\n\nthe organisation to back up key positions. Viewed from this angle and\n\ncomparing it with the incentive in the present case it can be vouchsafed\n\nthat acquisition of higher qualification after being appointed is expected to\n\nuplift the standard of education and it would benefit both the schools and\n\nthe students. A person with a higher degree even if may be ineligible by\n\nreason of his entry in the service with a lower degree can contribute to the\n\nknowledge bank of the school and expectedly can impart better education.\n\nA teacher with a pass-graduate degree although may not expect a higher\n\nscale of pay can legitimately expect an incentive on acquiring of higher\n\nqualification which can act as a cushion for not being considered for\n\npromotion. Education shall be given highest priority and the teachers are\n\nexpected to receive decent salary and incentive. As often stated a teacher\n\ntakes a hand, opens a mind and touches a heart. The transfer of his soul to\n\nthe student's soul seen through the students is the quality of a good\n\nteacher. A teacher can only impart a proper and better education once he\n\nfeels secured with his job and expect incentive for acquiring higher\n\nqualification, although he cannot claim higher scale of pay of that of a\n\nteacher who joined service with an Honours-graduate degree or Post\n\nGraduate Degree. He cannot be treated alike since the process of selection\n\nand recruitment are different. However, caught in between stagnation and\n\npromotion, incentive can provide solace to the teachers who have acquired\n\nhigher qualifications after they joined service. Although the claim for\n\nincentive cannot be considered to be a Fundamental Right, the obligation\nand duties of the state not to provide a decent pay with incentive need not\n\nbe overstated. It is a policy decision of the State which we feel needs to be\n\nreviewed. The State must formulate a policy with regard to career\n\nadvancement scheme in respect of the teachers facing stagnation and\n\nacquiring higher qualification during employment by way of an incentive.\n\nThe number of increments also needs to be reviewed.\n\nxvi) In\nShanti Sports Club and Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.\n\nreported in 2009(15) SCC 705 the Honourable Supreme Court\n\ndiscussed the ambit of\nArticle 14\nand held that the concept of\n\nequality enshrined in that Article is a positive concept. The Court\n\ncan command the State to give equal treatment to similarly\n\nsituated persons, but cannot issue a mandate that the State\n\nshould commit illegality or pass wrong order because in another\n\ncase such an illegality has been committed or wrong order has\n\nbeen passed. If any illegality or irregularity has been committed in\n\nfavour of an individual or a group of individuals, others cannot\n\ninvoke the jurisdiction of the High Court or of this Court and seek\n\na direction that the same irregularity or illegality be committed in\n\ntheir favour by the State or its agencies/instrumentalities.\n\nxvii) In\nAkhtar Hossain Chowdhury v. State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs.\n, reported in 2013 (2) CHN (Cal) 632 the argument of Mr.\n\nMoitra that paragraph 3 of the circular dated 27th November,\n\n2007 cannot override the provisions of the\nWest Bengal Schools\n\n(Control of Expenditure Act, 2005\n) was accepted as would be\nevident from paragraphs 15 to 18 of\nthe said decision\n. The said\n\nparagraphs read:\n\n\"15. Mr. Moitra also submits that Para 3 of the aforesaid\ncircular dated 27th November, 2007 cannot override the\nprovisions of the\nWest Bengal Schools (Control of\nExpenditure) Act, 2005\n.\n\n16. Mr. Moitra invites our attention to\nSection 14 (3)\nof the\naforesaid Act, 2005 and submits that the\nappellant/petitioner is entitled to draw pay of post\ngraduate upon acquiring post graduate degree. The said\n\nsection 14(3)\nis set out hereunder :\n\n\"(3) Every teacher of a school shall, if appointed in the\nHonours Graduate or Postgraduate teacher category,\nbe entitled to draw pay of Post-graduate teacher\ncategory, upon acquiring Post-graduate degree, in the\nmanner as may be specified by order.\"\n\n17. It is true that a circular cannot override the specific\nprovisions of the Act. In the present case, the\nappellant/petitioner was admittedly appointed in the\nschool as Honours Graduate with B.Ed degree. As a\nmatter of fact, at the time of joining the school qualification\nof the appellant was Honours Graduate in Mathematics\nand B.Ed. Subsequently the said appellant acquired post-\ngraduate degree. Therefore, in terms of Section 14(3) of\nThe West Bengal Act, XIV of 2005 appellant herein is\nentitled to draw pay of postgraduate teacher.\n\nFurthermore, Para 3 of the Office order dated 27th\nNovember, 2007 has not been specifically violated in the\npresent case since the appellant also sought for prior\npermission from the concerned District Inspector of Schools\nfor undergoing post graduate studies through the\nmanaging committee of the school and such permission\nwas never denied by the said District Inspector of Schools.\n\n18. Considering the aforesaid facts, we are of the opinion\nthat the District Inspector of Schools should not have\nrejected the claim of the appellant/petitioner for higher\nscale of pay even after acquiring higher qualification i.e.\nM.Sc in Mathematics.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nWe are in agreement with\nthe said decision\n.\n\nxviii) In\nAdeel Uz Zaman v. State of West Bengal & Ors.\n, in MAT\n\nNo.825 of 2020 decided on 11th February, 2021 a Co-ordinate\n\nBench constituting of one of us (Soumen Sen, J.) in considering\n\nthe claim of the appellant for higher scale of pay directed\n\nconsideration of the matter on the ground that appellant was\n\nappointed in science and maths group against a sanctioned\n\nvacancy and at the relevant point of time he was holding B.SC.\n\n(Hons.) degree in Chemistry. It was on the basis of such\n\nqualification he was appointed as a Science Teacher in Chemistry\n\nof the said college. The authority concerned was aware of the fact\n\nthat he was pursuing higher studies at the time of his\n\nappointment. In fact, he had completed his Part-I examination in\n\nM.Sc and was pursuing his higher studies. It was on such factual\n\nbackground we considered the Government Order dated 27th\n\nNovember, 2007 and observed:\n\"Clause 1 of the said order is applicable when the teacher\nconcerned is yet to enrol himself in the course and to appear in\nthe examination for enhancement of education qualification. The\nvery fact that he had already enrolled himself prior to his\nappointment and that he had already participated in the said\nexamination and successfully completed M.Sc. part-I, in our\nconsidered opinion he is not required to obtain any prior\npermission to enrol himself for the purpose of appearing in the\nfuture examination for enhancement of his educational\nqualification as contemplated in clause 3 of the Government\nOrder dated 27th November, 2007.\nIn such view of the matter the\ndecision cited by the Government Pleader passed by a learned\nSingle Judge in\nPurna Chandra Misra\n(supra) has no manner of\napplication.\n\nLearned Government Pleader has also relied on two decisions of\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the cases of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas\nParishad & Anr.-vs.-Friends Coop. Housing Society Ltd. &\nAnr. reported in (1995) Supl. (3) SCC 456, paragraph 6 and\nHigh Court of Judicature for Rajasthan-vs.-P.P. Singh &\nAnr. reported in (2003) 4 SCC 239, paragraph 40, in support of\nhis argument that any claim for higher benefits cannot be allowed\nunless the prior permission is taken. In U.P. Avas Evam Vikas\nParishad & Anr. (supra), at paragraph 5 another judgment of\nthe Apex Court in Life Insurance Corporation of India-vs.-\nEscorts Ltd. and Ors.: (1986) 1 SCC 264 was referred in\nwhich the distinction between approval and permission was\nconsidered, in the context of\nSection 29 (1)\nof the Life Insurance\nCorporation of India Act. It was observed that the difference\nbetween approval and permission is that in the first case the\naction holds good until it is disapproved, while in the other case it\ndoes not does not become effective until permission is obtained.\nBut permission subsequently granted may validate the previous\nact. In our respectful reading of the said two decisions it does not\nappear to us that there is any embargo under the statute or the\nrelevant rule to grant any ex post facto permission if there is\nsufficient reasons otherwise to grant permission.\n\nThere cannot be any doubt that a person with higher qualification\nwould be expected to have better knowledge in the subject and\nthe students are likely to be benefited by reason of acquiring such\nhigher qualification. The benefit of higher qualification is no doubt\nbenefit the teacher in terms of money but the students are the\nbeneficiary of such acquired knowledge. The institution is as such\nbenefited. It would be the endeavour of all schools to have\nacademic excellence and it is the duty of the State to encourage\nacademic excellence in all the institutions since the ultimate\nbeneficiary would be the students. We feel that some guidelines\nshould be in place to decide a case like the present one as\nabsence of any such guidelines may lead to arbitrary rejection of\na deserving candidate.\n\nWe are not unmindful of the fact that the\nWest Bengal Schools\n(Control and Expenditure) Act, 2005\nwas enacted to provide for\nthe control of expenditure in the schools in West Bengal and\nunless the authorities are of the opinion that such expenditure\ntowards payment of the higher salary of a teacher would be a\nfutile exercise or would not be beneficial to the schools or the\nstudents, the authorities may decline payment of higher scale of\npay. Higher scale of pay would encourage the teacher and would\nbe a motivating factor which ought not to be ignored. The\nconsideration for denying higher scale of pay could be that,\nalready there are sufficient numbers of teachers having\nHonours/post-graduate degree on the same subject in the\ninstitution and, as such, payment of higher scale of pay would be\na burden on exchequer. In other words staff pattern may not\njustify any higher qualified teacher in a particular subject. In the\npresent case appellant is in receipt of honours graduate scale of\npay, staff pattern cannot be a bar for extending the benefit of post\ngraduate scale of pay. We also observe that the relevant Rule\ndoes not prevent the authorities from giving an ex-post-facto\napproval if occasion so arises.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\nWe are in agreement with the view expressed.\n\nIn fact in\nDebola Das\n(supra) the authorities allowed Debola to\nhigher scale of pay as she had partially completed her study\nbefore entering service and hence no prior permission from DI\nwould be required.\n\nxix) In\nThe State of West Bengal v. Megnath Roy\n, in MAT 514 of\n\n2019 decided on 16th December, 2019, the same bench that had\n\ndecided\nAdeel Uz Zaman\n(supra) considered the School Education\n\nDepartment Clause 3 of the Notification dated 27th November,\n\n2007 and interpreted the relevant rules in favour of the writ\n\npetitioner and allowed the writ petition on the following reasoning:\n\n\"It appears from record that the writ petitioner made\nrepresentation to the Ad Hoc Committee of the previous\nschool on 23rd April, 2010 to allow him to pursue the course\nof master degree in Geography through distant mode of\neducation. Thereafter, he joined the present school and\nsimilar application was made to the Managing Committee of\nthe present school. The Managing Committee of the present\nschool vide resolution dated 23rd June, 2013 allowed the\npetitioner to pursue higher studies without affecting the day\nto day academic necessity of the students. The petitioner\ncompleted the distance education course successfully and\nobtained master degree in Geography. When he approached\nthe District Inspector of Schools (SE) for higher scale of pay,\nthe same was denied on the ground that he had not obtained\nthe said degree after obtaining prior permission from the\nDistrict Inspector of Schools vide issuing memo dated 23rd\nApril, 2018.\n\nThere cannot be any doubt that at the time when he joined\nthe present school he was already pursuing his higher\nstudies but the only mistake possibly he had done not to\nseek the permission in terms of Clause 3 of the Government\nCircular dated 27th November, 2007.\n\nMr. Jana, learned Counsel for the respondent had drawn our\nattention to a communication dated 8th June, 2017 from the\nDeputy Director of School Education to the District Inspector\nof Schools (SE) directing such authorities to refer the case to\nthe Directorate and not to the School Education Department\nfor disposal of cases of higher scale of pay of teachers of\nsecondary schools as per existing rules in case such\nauthorities facing difficulty. Under\nSection 14(3)\nof the West\nBengal Schools (Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005, Honours-\ngraduate teacher is entitled to draw pay scale of post-\ngraduate teacher upon acquiring postgraduate degree in the\nmanner as may be specified by the order.\n\nOn 27th November, 2007, the School Education Department,\nSecondary Branch issued Order No. 593- SE(B)/ES/O/B/\n1M-98/2007, wherein clause 3 it is stated that the teacher is\nrequired to seek prior permission of concerned District\nInspector of Schools only when he wants to draw additional\nincrement/higher scale of pay for obtaining such higher\nqualification through the Managing Committee of the School.\nThere is nothing on record to show that the Managing\nCommittee has forwarded the request of the writ petitioner to\nthe District Inspector of Schools for higher scale of pay for\nobtaining higher qualification. Undoubtedly, the writ\npetitioner, at the time of joining the present school was\nalready pursuing the higher studies and the Managing\nCommittee of the present school had permitted him to pursue\nsuch course without affecting academic interest of the\ninstitution.\nSection 14(3)\n, as it stands, does not require any\nprior permission to be taken for obtaining higher\nqualification. However, manner in which a teacher must be\nentitled to higher scale of pay upon acquiring post-graduate\ndegree is indicated in the Government Order dated 27th\nNovember, 2007.\"\n\nxx) In Trilochan Jana v. State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs., reported at 2008 (2) WBLR (Cal) 913 the learned Single\n\nJudge considered Clause 16(5) of ROPA 1990, Clause 12(5) of\n\nROPA 1998 and Sub-\nsection 3\nof\nSection 14\nof 2005 Act and held\n\nthat even if it is possible to urge that a subsequent enactment\n\nmay do away with certain benefits that had been conferred by\n\nearlier regulations on an employee but the provision by which it is\n\nsought to be taken away is subject to strict construction and any\n\nbenefit of doubt has to be given to the person whose benefit is\n\nsought to be taken away.\n\nSub-\nsection 3\nof\nSection 14\nand\nSection 20\nof Act 2005 was\n\ninterpreted in the following manner:\n\n\"10. SUB-SECTION 3 is worded differently and the\neffect of it is quite distinct from subsections 1 and 2 of\nSection 14\n. Sub-\nsection 3\nequates honours graduate\nand postgraduate teachers and says that teachers of\neither category would be entitled to draw the pay of\npost graduate teachers upon acquiring post graduate\ndegree. Sub-\nsection 3\nof\nSection 14\ndoes not reflect on\nthe rights conferred under clause 16 (5) of ROPA, 1990\nas preserved or modified by clause 12 (5) of ROPA,\n1998.\nSection 16\nand\nSection 20\nare the savings and\noverriding provisions of the Act of 2005:\nSection 16\n\npreserves the previous rights in the limited manner as\nspecified therein.\nSection 20\nis the omnibus overriding\nprovision: \"20. The provisions of this Act or any rules\nor orders made thereunder shall have effect\nnotwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in\nany other law for the time being in force or in any\ncontract, custom or usages to the contrary,\"\n\n(11). SECTION 20 will apply in a case where there is\nany express provision in the Act of 2005 which is in\nconflict with any provision or any contract or custom or\nusage contrary to such provision existing at the time of\ncoming into effect of the said Act of 2005. Since\nSection\n14 (3)\nof the said Act of 2005 does not detract from\nclause 16 (5) of ROPA, 1998 as preserved in a slightly\nmodified form by clause 12 (5) of ROPA, 1998.\nSection\nhas no manner of application in the matter of\ncurtailing any right that the writ petitioner had under\nthe relevant clause of the earlier regulations.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nxxi) In\nChaitali Banerjee v. The State of West\n\nBengal & Ors., reported in 2019 (2) CHN (Cal) 568 Justice\n\nTalukdar has considered the Memo dated 27th November, 2007\nand interpreted the word \"and\" in the said Memo as conjunctive in\n\nthe facts of the said case.\n\nIn\nChaitali Chatterjee\n(supra) a provisional certificate was\n\ngranted in favour of the writ petitioner with an enrolment number\n\nand on basis of such enrolment number the writ petitioner\n\ncompleted her M.SC Part-II Course on 7th February, 2010. Having\n\nregard to the admitted fact that she completed the post graduate\n\ncourse on the basis of such certificate the claim of enhancement\n\nof qualification in terms of Clause 1 of Memorandum Dated 27th\n\nNovember, 2007 was treated as single enrolment in the composite\n\nM.SC Course prior to taking up duties in the school.\n\nxxii) In\nPannalal Mahata v. State of West Bengal &\n\nOrs.\n, in W.P. No.22280(W) of 2012 decided on 30th July, 2015\n\non noticing that the District Inspector School Purulia granted post\n\nfacto permission in favour of one Shri Gorai to enhance his\n\nqualification and was allowed post graduate scale of pay with\n\neffect from 25th July, 2013 that is, the date following the last date\n\nof examination Pannalal being similarly placed should be given\n\nthe same benefits more so when the staff pattern permits another\n\nteacher by reason of the retirement of one of the teachers in the\n\nmean time.\n\nHowever, we must clearly state that no appointment can be made\n\ndisregarding staff pattern even if a teacher acquires higher\nqualification. If such higher qualification is acquired with the\n\nprior permission then it must be presumed that the authority\n\nconcerned consciously and with having the knowledge of all\n\nessential facts granted permission for acquiring higher\n\nqualification involving financial benefits.\n\n201. It is well settled that rules can supplement the statute and\n\ncannot supplant it. There is presumption against the retrospective operation\n\nof the statute. The 2005 Act read with the Government Memorandum dated\n\n26th December, 2005 makes it clear that to effectuate the purpose of the\n\n2005 Act different categories of teachers on fulfilment of certain conditions\n\nwould be entitled to get financial benefits. Admittedly the Government\n\nMemorandum of 26th December, 2005 was issued in the name of the\n\nGovernor unlike the Government order dated 27th November, 2007. It is\n\nauthenticated under Clause (3) of\nArticle 166\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nWhen the Parent Statute does not contemplate retroactive operation all\n\nfinancial benefits payable to the teaching and non-teaching staff under\n\ndifferent ROPA till the government order was issued dated 27th November,\n\n2007 cannot be denied, curtailed or taken away. The court should not lean\n\nin favour of an interpretation which would deny a benefit to the employees\n\nby reason of a subsequent statute unless the later statute expressly bars\n\nany such benefits retrospectively.\nThe reason being that any such\n\ninterpretation would result in arbitrariness. It would be harsh and\n\nirrational to give to the Government order dated 27th November, 2007 a\n\nretrospective effect. The doctrine of fairness also is to be considered as a\nrelevant factor for construing the retrospective operation of the statute. [See\n\nGovernment of India & Ors. v. Indian Tobacco Association\n; 2005(7)\n\nSCC 396] Valuable rights have accrued in favour of the teaching and non\n\nteaching staff under several ROPAs till the\nExpenditure Act\nof 2005 was\n\nintroduced and given effect to the financial benefits. Moreover, the 2005 Act\n\nis not intended to deny financial benefits to a Honours graduate degree\n\nholder to obtain post graduate degree. A teacher, who has pursued and\n\ncompleted post graduate degree prior to 27th November, 2007 cannot be\n\ndenied post graduate scale of pay if he has joined course prior to the coming\n\ninto force in 2005 and has completed the course by the time the\n\nGovernment order dated 27th November, 2007 has come into force or\n\nbecome effective. We also do not find the rationality for selecting the date of\n\nconvocation for the purpose of extending financial benefits for the simple\n\nreason that the relevant and important date is the date of publication of the\n\nresult and on the basis of the result so published and declared a teacher\n\nwould be entitled to post graduate scale of pay.\n\n202. Similarly, the scale of pay to which a teacher joined cannot be\n\naltered to his/her disadvantage.\n\n203. The staff pattern introduced vide Government order dated 8th\n\nJuly, 1974 and 4th September, 1998 is for the purpose of equitable\n\ndistribution of the available posts as to enable pass degree holder to also\n\ncomplete for appointment as Assistant teacher. The issue of staff pattern vis\n\na vis higher scale of pay was explained by Justice Dipankar Datta as His\n\nLordship then was before His Lordship's elevation as the Chief Justice of\nBombay High Court and thereafter to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\nShivaji Chakraborty vs. State of West Bengal and Ors. (WP\n9657(w) of\n\n2009) decided on 23rd June, 2010 in the following words:\n\n\"Once a teacher with pass-degree is appointed, the object for which\nsuch Government Orders were introduced is sub-served. The said\nGovernment Orders do not lay down any restriction on a teacher\nfrom enhancing his educational qualification. It has to be\nremembered that enhancing of educational qualification by a\nteacher serves two-fold purpose: (i) the likelihood of hike in pay in\nthe absence of available channel of promotion a teacher encourages\nto enhance his qualification and thereby the prospect of stagnation\nin service is averted and (ii) to some extent at least the students to\nwhom lessons are imparted are benefited by the knowledge the\nteacher has derived after successfully obtaining the Master's\nDegree. At the time the petitioner was appointed or when he\nenhanced his qualification after permission was accorded, there\nwas no statutory provision in the field that could stand in the way of\nhe being granted the higher scale of pay for acquiring higher\nqualification. The petitioner was granted permission by the\nAdditional District Inspector and based on such permission, he\nobtained necessary study leave in accordance with the Leave Rules\nand his leave has also been sanctioned by the Board. The ultimate\nsuccess that the petitioner achieved by obtaining Master's Degree\nwould be set at naught if the State respondents are now allowed to\ndeny his claim based on a law which was not in existence on the\ndate right accrued in his favour to have higher scale of pay offered\nto him. It is settled law that a vested right cannot be taken away by\nan enactment, unless of course, such enactment has retrospective\noperation. As already been noted, the Act has not been given\nretrospective operation provisions of\nSection 16\nof the Act may also\nbe taken note of in this connection which reads as follows:\n\"16. Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act,\nthe terms and conditions of service of a teacher or a non-teaching\nstaff in the employment of a school immediately before the\ncommencement of this Act, shall not be varied to his\ndisadvantage in so far as such terms and conditions relate to the\nappointment of such teachers and nonteaching staff to the post\nheld by them immediately before the commencement of this Act\".\n\nTherefore, the act cannot stand in the way of the petitioner being\noffered the higher scale of pay. (emphasis supplied)\n\nUndoubtedly persons similarly placed as Shivaji Chakraborty would\n\nbe entitled to higher scale of pay on enhancement of their qualification\n\nand we are in agreement with the view expressed in this regard.\n\n204. We agree with the submission of the learned Advocate General\n\nthat career advancement scheme does not create any vested right or a legal\n\nright to claim higher scale of pay. It was introduced to take care of\n\nstagnation qua promotion. The teacher is not precluded from acquiring\n\nhigher degree and compete for the higher post during the recruitment\n\nprocess. The process of selection and recruitment are different. Acquiring of\n\nhigher qualification is not a fundamental right but a person acquiring a\n\nhigher qualification is entitled to participate in the examination for higher\n\npost or for promotion if such qualification is commensurate with the post for\n\nwhich he applied. A person with Pass Graduate Degree cannot be treated at\n\npar with an Honours Graduate or a Post Graduate. The qualifications at the\n\nentry level are the determining factor.\n205. The word 'vested' came up for consideration in\nM.G.B. Gramin\n\nBank vs. Chakrawarti Singh\n; 2014(13) SCC 583 in connection with a\n\nscheme for compassionate appointment. The court observed as under:\n\n\"11. The word 'vested' is defined in Black's Law Dictionary (6th\nEdition) at page 1563, as:\n\n'Vested',-fixed; accrued; settled; absolute; complete. Having the\ncharacter or given in the rights of absolute ownership; not\ncontingent; not subject to be defeated by a condition precedent.\nRights are 'vested' when right to enjoyment, present or\nprospective, has become property of some particular person or\npersons as present interest; mere expectancy of future benefits,\nor contingent interest in property founded on anticipated\ncontinuance of existing laws, does not constitute 'vested rights'.\n\n12. In Webster's Comprehensive Dictionary (International Edition) at\npage 1397, 'vested' is defined as Law held by a tenure subject to no\ncontingency; complete; established by law as a permanent right;\n\nvested interest. (Vide:\nBibi Sayeeda v. State of Bihar\n; AIR 1996 SC\n516; and\nJ.S. Yadav v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n: (2011) 6 SCC 570)\n\n13. Thus, vested right is a right independent of any contingency and\nit cannot be taken away without consent of the person concerned.\nVested right can arise from contract, statute or by operation of law.\nUnless an accrued or vested right has been derived by a party, the\npolicy decision/scheme could be changed. (Vide:Kuldip Singh v.\nGovernment, NCT Delhi : AIR 2006 SC 2652).\n\n206. The aforesaid decision was considered in\nSecretary to\n\nGovernment Department of Education (Primary) and Ors. v. Bheemesh\n\nAlias Bheemappa\n; 2021 SCC Online SC 1264 in which after considering\n\nall the decisions with regard to the scheme that would be applicable to the\nlegal heirs of a deceased in the die-in-harness category, it was observed that\n\nin cases where benefit under the existing scheme was taken away or\n\nsubstituted with a lesser benefit the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its earlier\n\ndecisions directed the application of the new scheme, but in cases where the\n\nbenefits under an existing scheme were enlarged by a modified scheme after\n\nthe death of the employee, this court had applied only the scheme that was\n\nin force on the date of death of the employee. This is fundamentally due to\n\nthe fact that compassionate appointment was always considered to be an\n\nexception to the normal method of recruitment and perhaps looked down\n\nupon with lesser compassion for the individual and greater concern for the\n\nrule of law.\n\n207.\nIn\nState of M.P. & Anr. v. Shakri Khan\n; 1996(8) SCC 648\n\nthe issue was with regards to the entitlement of an incentive scheme\n\nintroduced after the respondent was appointed. The government had\n\nintroduced a scheme of granting two advance increments for the Lower\n\nDivision Clerk who passed Hindi typewriting test. They prescribed the last\n\ndate for passing the test as 30th July, 1973 and those who passed the Hindi\n\ntypewriting test prior to that date were declared eligible to get two advance\n\nincrements. The respondent passed the test in December, 1979 and based\n\nhis claim on the basis of certain instructions issued from time to time that is\n\nbetween 20th April, 1974 and 15th January, 1979. The Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt agreed with the State that the Government having had the power to\n\nextend the benefit it also has the power to put a cut off date. Consequently,\n\nthe cut off date, that is, 30th July, 1973 for passing the test is a proper\nclassification. It was held that all those who did not pass the test prior to\n\nthe date but appointed earlier to the date are not eligible to two advance\n\nincrements on their passing the said test after the cut off date. This\n\njudgment was cited by the Learned Advocate General to demonstrate the\n\nineligibility of candidates who were appointed in a pass-graduate category\n\nand obtained higher qualification in the course of their employment. They\n\ncannot question at this stage that they should be treated at par with the\n\ncandidates who have been recruited as Honours Graduate or Post Graduate.\n\n208. The decision in FMA 2368 of 2015 (\nState of West Bengal &\n\nOrs. v. Gautam Ghosh & Ors.\n) decided on 5th April, 2019 was relied upon\n\nto show that the date of issuance of provisional certificate and the\n\nconvocation are different. The date of convocation shall be relevant. The\n\nparagraphs relied upon are:\n\n\"We would have had absolutely no difficulty in allowing the\nadditional benefit to the respondent no. 1/petitioner if the Rules\nhad enabled the said respondent no. 1 to claim for higher scale\nof pay from the date of acquisition of the degree. We are in\nrespectful agreement with the view expressed by the Division\nBench that for the purpose of acquisition of doctorate degree the\ndate of provisional certificate should be the relevant date.\nHowever, paragraph 12 (5) of ROPA 1998 says that a teacher\nacquiring a doctorate degree shall be entitled to the benefit of\ntwo additional increments from the date of the convocation on\nwhich the degree is awarded. When the law based on which a\nclaim is made fixes the period from which a benefit can be\nclaimed it cannot be altered by giving an interpretation on when\na degree is acquired by a candidate. That will be altering the\nprovisions of the relevant Rules. If the date of convocation is the\nonly relevant date and if the Rules stipulate that the date of\nconvocation is the date on which the degree is awarded\nwhether in a given case it can be said that a candidate had\nacquired the degree before, becomes a consideration not very\nrelevant for the purpose. It must 6 be remembered that\nacquisition of qualification and awarding of degree are two\ndifferent things and paragraph 12(5) of ROPA 1998 fixes the\ndate from which such claim can be made to the date of\nconvocation which has been recognised as the date when the\ndegree is awarded.\n\nIn the present case, the convocation was held on March 9, 2006\nwhen ROPA 1998 was not in operation. The petitioner has\nclaimed additional benefits on the basis of ROPA 1998.\nTherefore, the Rules on which the claim is made must be in\nexistence on which he has acquired the qualification and after\nthe introduction of ROPA 1998 with effect from January 1, 2006\nROPA 1998 had ceased to be in existence on the date the\nconvocation was held and the date on which the degree was\nawarded upon the petitioner. Since the Rules themselves had\nceased to exist on the date the degree was awarded the\npetitioner/respondent no. 1 must be held to be ineligible that\nthe benefits claimed by him under ROPA 1998.\n\nWe agree with the learned Single Judge that the Act does not\ncontain any provision which disentitles the petitioner from\nclaiming the benefit. While holding this the learned Single\nJudge was also required to clarify that if the Act does not\ncontain any bar where lay the source of the petitioner's\nentitlement. That entitlement was in ROPA 1998 which was not\nexamined by the learned Single Judge.\nThus, we have no alternative to hold that the respondent no.\n1/petitioner is not entitled the benefit.\"\n\n209. However we are not agreeing with the view that the conferment\n\nof degree of the convocation would be the relevant date for the reasons we\n\nhave already indicated.\n\n210.\nIn Director of Treasuries in\nKarnataka & Anr. v. V.\n\nSomyashree\nreported in AIR 2021 SC 5620 the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nwas considering the entitlement of a divorced daughter to be considered for\n\ncompassionate appointment. It was held that at the relevant time when the\n\nemployee died and when applicant made an application for appointment on\n\ncompassionate ground, divorced daughter, was not within the definition of\n\ndependent and hence not eligible for appointment on compassionate\n\ngrounds.\n\n211. We are faced with two apparently conflicting decisions of two\n\nDivision Benches with regard to entitlement of a teacher who was appointed\n\nin pass category and thereafter enhanced his qualification during his\n\nemployment would be entitled to a higher scale of pay. The initial\n\nappointment for the post is under \"pass category''.\n\n212.\nIn\nTarak Chandra Roy\n(supra) the question for consideration\n\nwas:\n\n\"After the School Service Commission Act, 1997 came into force\nwould the appointees get the benefit of the higher scale of pay\ndespite being interviewed and selected in pass category\".\n213. The selection test was only in pass category. There was no\n\nvacancy in the post of Honours graduate/Post graduate teacher in the\n\nphysical education. Admittedly, Tarak was a post graduate degree holder in\n\nphysical science and in 1998 when he participated in the selection process\n\nfor educational teachers there was no vacancy in the post of Honours\n\ngraduate/Post graduate teacher.\n\n214. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition on the\n\nground that after the Act of 1997 came into force there had been different\n\ncategories for appointment and extension of benefit of higher scale of pay\n\nbecause improvement of qualification is no more permissible.\n\n215. Tarak joined the school on 23rd March, 1999 as an assistant\n\nteacher in physical education. The appointment was duly approved by the\n\nDistrict Inspector of School. On 27th September, 2001 Tarak made a\n\nrepresentation to the DI for the grant of Masters Degree scale of pay. The\n\nrepresentation was not considered for which a writ petition was filed being\n\nWP 449(w) of 2003. This writ petition was disposed of on 25th January, 2003\n\nby directing the Secretary of Managing Committee of the school to pass a\n\nreasoned order after hearing. The Managing Committee in its meeting held\n\non 22nd February, 2003 recommended the case of Tarak for higher scale of\n\npay to the District Inspector of School. The DI rejected the recommendation.\n\nThe contention of Tarak was that he acquired Masters Degree in Physical\n\nEducation before qualifying in the School Service Commission that is prior\n\nto March in 1999, and claimed higher scale of pay in terms of Government\n\nOrder No.417-SE(S)/5P-33/98 dated 8th March, 2000.\n216. This order provides that the higher scale of pay would be\n\nadmissible to those physical education teachers who have obtained such\n\nhigher post graduate degree on completion of two years regular course from\n\na recognized University. The petitioner having completed the post graduate\n\nqualification from a recognized university claimed higher scale of pay under\n\nthe aforesaid circular. This circular was issued in modification of the earlier\n\ncircular, i.e. G.O. No.796-Edn(S)/5P-78/93 dated 22nd November, 1993\n\nwhere the benefit of higher scale of pay to the Physical Education teachers of\n\nthe Secondary School and Junior High Schools including those of\n\nMadrashas of various types having Masters Degree in Physical Education\n\nfrom a recognized University was allowed.\n\n217. Tarak claimed to be qualified under both the circulars for the\n\nhigher pay scale. Tarak claimed that having acquired the higher\n\nqualification earlier to being selected, the promulgation of the enactment of\n\nWest Bengal Schools (Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005\nwould not be\n\napplicable as the vested rights of the petitioner could not be taken away.\n\n218. The respondents contended that the circular dated 22nd\n\nNovember, 1993 has no manner of application in respect of assistant\n\nteacher of physical education appointed on the recommendation of the\n\ncommission subsequent to the 1997 Act. Similarly, the Circular dated 8th\n\nMarch, 2000 has no manner of application as it is merely clarificatory of the\n\nCircular dated 22nd November, 1993. Moreover, Tarak participated in the\n\nselection test of 1998 in pass graduate category and he was appointed as an\n\nassistant teacher in the pass category. He again participated in another\nselection test in the year 2002. His name was again recommended on the\n\nbasis of the fresh recommendation. He again joined in the same post but in\n\na different school with the approval of the DI on 22nd April, 2003. The scale\n\nof pay of the petitioner was fixed in terms of Government Order dated 12th\n\nFebruary, 1999 and 13th July, 1999 and the later categorically provides that\n\nif a teacher is appointed by the Commission his pay would be fixed in the\n\nscale of pay as per his qualification as mentioned by the said Commission.\n\nTarak having been appointed in the pass category clearly, therefore, could\n\nnot claim benefit of his post graduate qualification.\n\n219. On such consideration the Hon'ble Division Bench presided over\n\nby the then Chief Justice of the Calcutta High Court held:\n\n\"We have considered the submission made by the learned\ncounsel. In our opinion, the petitioner being an appointee\nsubsequent to the promulgation of the\nWest Bengal Service\nCommission Act, 1997\ncannot be given the benefit of Circular\ndated 22nd November, 1993 and 8th March, 2000. Petitioner\nhaving been appointed as Assistant Teacher pass category can\nonly get the pay scale specified by the commission for that post.\nEven otherwise the benefit of Circular dated 22nd November,\n1993 and 8th March, 2000 would not confer any vested right\nupon the Assistant Teachers. NO such right has been protected\nunder the\nWest Bengal Schools (Control of Expenditure) Act, 2005\n.\nIn view of\nSection 14\nof the 2005 Act no graduate category\nteacher is entitled to claim any additional increment for acquiring\nany qualification than the qualifications specified for such post.\nThe provision in\nSection 16\nwould not be applicable to aid the\nclaim of the petitioner as by virtue of\nSection 20\nof the 2005 Act\nthe Circulars and orders existing previously stand abrogated.\nThat being the position of law, the petitioner would not be entitled\nto claim higher scale of pay. We, therefore, dismiss the writ\npetition.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n220. The Special Leave Petition being SLP (Civil)... CC No.5406 of\n\n2009 was dismissed on 4th May, 2009.\n\n221.\nIn\nSampa Sahu v. State of West Bengal (W.P. No.\n15866 of\n\n2000), the learned Single Judge took note of the decision of the Division\n\nBench in this manner:\n\n\"28. Be it noted that the Division Bench was concerned with the\ncase of a teacher of Physical Education. The requisite minimum\nqualification for all posts of teachers of Physical Education is Pass\nGraduate. Therefore, no case was made out before the Division\nBench of discrimination between two sets of teachers performing the\nsame duties and functions and possessing the same educational\nqualification.\"\n\n222. Tarak was decided on 17th of January, 2008.\n\n223. Subsequent thereto, on 8th April, 2008, Sauvik Ghosh & Ors.\n\n(supra) was decided by another Division Bench in which same issue came\n\nup for consideration. The facts are little different. Unlike Tarak, Sauvik\n\npassed the Bachelor of Physical Education in the first class from the\n\nUniversity of Kalyani in 1999. Thereafter he took admission in the two year\n\npost graduate course conducted by the University of Kalyani.\n\n224. In 1999 he appeared in the Regional Level Selection Test (in\n\nshort 'RLST') conducted by the West Bengal School Service Commission for\n\nappointment as Assistant Teacher of Physical Education in aided non-\ngovernment schools. He cleared the selection test. He was recommended for\n\nappointment by the Commission on 8th March, 2001 to the post of assistant\n\nteacher of Physical Education in an aided non-government\n\nsecondary/higher secondary school. At the material point of time when he\n\nwas appointed to the school he had appeared for the Masters of Physical\n\nEducation final examination but the result was published on 22nd\n\nSeptember, 2001 after he was appointed.\n\n225. On successful completion of the Masters in Physical Education\n\nSauvik made a representation to the District Inspector of Schools concerned\n\nfor re-fixation of the pay in the higher post graduate scale. The Director of\n\nschool education refused to grant post graduate scale of pay.\n\n226. This has resulted in a writ petition being filed by Sauvik. The\n\nwrit petition was allowed and the authorities concerned were directed to fix\n\nthe scale of pay by granting him the higher post graduate scale of pay.\n\n227. This order was under appeal.\n\n228. The main ground urged in the appeal was that the learned\n\nSingle Judge ignored the Government Order No.155-SE(B) dated 13th July,\n\n1999 in terms whereof the post graduate scale of pay can only be granted to\n\nteachers appointed to posts for which the requisite qualification is a post\n\ngraduate degree. Moreover, a teacher appointed through the School Service\n\nCommission could, in terms of the said Government Order, be given the\n\nscale of pay pertaining to the qualification as recorded by the School Service\n\nCommission in its recommendation.\n229. The said judgment was also challenged on the ground that such\n\ndirection is contrary to the 2005 Act, and in particular\nSection 14(2)\nof the\n\nsaid Act which provides that every teacher of a school, who is appointed in\n\na post of the graduate teacher category, shall be entitled to draw the scale of\n\npay of the graduate teacher and shall not be entitled to claim any additional\n\nincrement or higher scale of pay for acquiring any qualification, other than\n\nthe qualification specified for the post.\n\n230. The Hon'ble Division Bench posed the following question for\n\ndetermination in the appeal:\n\n\"The question is, whether teachers appointed after 13th July,\n1999 and/or teachers who improved their qualifications after\n13th July, 1999 can be denied the scale of pay pertaining to their\nhigher qualification, either on the ground, that the School Service\nCommission, concerned did not mention the higher qualification in\nits recommendation or on the ground that the higher qualification\nwas not necessary for the teaching post held by the concerned\nteacher, having regard to the approved staff pattern of that\nschool.\"\n\n231. The Hon'ble Division Bench while acknowledging that the\n\nGovernment has power to issue orders and orders lawfully issued by the\n\ngovernment would have the force of law, has however, held that a\n\ngovernment order which contravenes a fundamental right guaranteed under\n\nthe Constitution would be null and void. The School Service Commission is\n\nrequired to act fairly, reasonably and in accordance with law. The School\nService Commission is obliged to record correctly the education qualification\n\nof the candidates as disclosed, subject however, to verification.\n\n232. The School Service Commission cannot omit or ignore\n\neducational qualifications as disclosed by a candidate which could be higher\n\nto the qualification required for the post and the commission might choose\n\nnot to give any credit for such higher educational qualification other than\n\nthe requisite educational qualification for the teaching post for the purpose\n\nof selection but cannot describe a candidate with post graduate degree as a\n\ngraduate in any communication.\n\n233. The government order dated 13th July, 1999 was interpreted as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"From the language and tenor of the Government Order dated\n13th July, 1999, it is apparent that the recommendation of the\nSchool Service Commission applies to initial fixation of pay and\nnot to refixation upon enhancement of educational qualifications\nor otherwise. If there is any discrepancy between the actual\neducational qualification and the educational qualification\nmentioned in the recommendation of the School Service\nCommission, the actual qualification would have to be taken into\naccount. From the language and tenor of the same Government\nOrder there does not appear to be any bar to grant of higher scale\nof pay to a teacher recommended through the School Service\nCommission, who has later enhanced his/her qualifications. If, as\nargued on behalf of the State, the Government Order dated 13th\nJuly, 1999 were to mean, initial fixation would be on the basis of\nthe educational qualifications mentioned in the recommendation\nof the School Service Commission, irrespective of whether the\nqualifications had correctly been recorded or not, and a teacher\nappointed on the recommendation of the School Service\nCommission would be bound by the qualification as mentioned in\nthe recommendation for all time to come, and even on\nenhancement of qualification, the teacher would not be entitled to\nthe higher scale of pay pertaining to qualification, only because\nthe School Service Commission had mentioned a different\nqualification in its initial recommendation, the Government Order\nwould have to be struck down as totally arbitrary, discriminatory\nand violative of\nArticle 14\ninter alia for the reasons elaborated\nhereinafter.\"\n\n234. The relevant Government Orders regarding the staff pattern of\n\nschools G.O. Nos.772-Edn.(S) dated Calcutta the 8th July, 1974; 403-SE (S)\n\ndated Calcutta the 3rd February, 1992 and 670-SE(S) dated Calcutta the\n\n4th September, 1998, were also considered in the light of the subsequent\n\ngovernment orders and the 2005 Act and it was held that there could be no\n\nreason as to why different qualifications have been fixed for the same\n\nteaching posts, involving the same teaching duties. The Government Orders\n\npertaining to staff pattern have nothing to do with salary and allowances.\n\nSalary and allowances are fixed on the basis of separate Rules for Revision\n\nof Pay and Allowances framed from time to time.\n\n235. The State is certainly competent to classify teachers on the\n\nbasis of qualifications, responsibilities, duties, length of service and the like\n\nfor the purpose of fixation of their pay and allowances. The classification\n\nmust, however, meet the test of reasonable nexus with the object sought to\n\nbe achieved by the classification.\n236. The Hon'ble Division Bench found that there is no rational\n\ncriteria for fixation of different qualification for different teaching posts\n\nwhich had nexus with the duties and responsibilities pertaining to teaching\n\nposts. It was observed: \"Where all assistant teachers constitute a single\n\nclass and as per the government orders pertaining to salary and allowances\n\nof their scales are to be fixed on the basis of qualifications in the relevant\n\nteaching subject, payment of different scales to two teachers with the same\n\nqualifications, teaching the same subjects in the same classes, in the same\n\nor in different aided non-government schools or Madrasahs and thus equally\n\ncircumstanced, on the basis of a sham classification based on the requisite\n\nqualification for the teaching post, as per the approved staff pattern, which\n\nis in no way related to the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the\n\nteaching posts, amounts to denial of equal pay for equal work and offends\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. It is immaterial that separate\n\nselection tests are conducted by the School Service Commission for posts\n\nearmarked for Pass Graduates and posts earmarked for Honours\n\nGraduates/Post Graduates.\"\n\n237. The conclusions are:\n\n\"The Government Order dated 13th July, 1999 in so far as the\nsame provides that teachers who improve their qualifications or\nare appointed with higher qualifications in subjects relevant to\ntheir teaching, would get higher scale of pay provided the higher\nqualification was a requisite qualification for the post as per\napproved staff pattern of the school is patently, discriminatory\nand violative of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India for reasons\nstated hereinabove.\n\nAs observed above, the order dated 13th July, 1999 is\nprospective. The said order discriminates between teachers who\nimproved their qualifications and/or were appointed with higher\nqualifications before 13th July, 1999 and those who improved\ntheir qualifications and/or were appointed with higher\nqualifications after 13th July, 1999 without rational\njustification.\n\nTeachers who were appointed with higher qualifications or\nimproved their qualifications before 13th July, 1999 continue to\nget the higher scale of pay irrespective of the qualification for the\npost. Therefore, even in case of teachers, with higher\nqualifications, holding posts for which the higher qualification is\nnot necessary, one set of teachers would get the higher scale of\npay pertaining to actual educational qualification and the other\nset would get the scale pertaining to the qualification fixed for\nthe post, though both sets are of equal status and required to\ndischarge the same duties and responsibilities.\"\n\n238. Justice Indira Banerjee as Her Ladyship then was before Her\n\nLadyship's elevation as the Chief Justice of Madras High Court and\n\nsubsequently to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India authored the aforesaid\n\njudgment and in a subsequent decision in\nSampa Sahu (Mondal\n) (supra)\n\nrevisited the issue upon consideration of\nTarak Chandra Roy\n(supra) in\n\nparagraphs 21to 29. The said paragraphs read:\n\n\"(21) The staff pattern of Schools including Madrasahs were, at all\nmaterial times governed by Government Circulars and/or Orders\nissued in this regard from time to time. The relevant Government\nOrders Indicate that qualifications for the same teaching post were\nto be fixed percentage wise. Out of two posts of Language Group\nteachers in a Junior High School, the minimum requisite\nqualification for one post was Pass Graduate and the minimum\nrequisite qualification for the other Honours Graduate/Masters\ndegree. When additional posts were sanctioned, the same\npercentage ratio was maintained. Thus, if a School was sanctioned\ntwo posts of Bengali Teachers who were required to teach Bengali\nin the same classes, the minimum requisite qualification for one\npost could be Pass Graduate and the minimum qualification for the\nother post could be Honours/Masters degree in Bengali.\n\n(22) There were teaching posts in Junior High Schools/Madrasahs\nfor which the requisite qualification was Pass Graduate and there\nwere teaching posts, also, in Junior High Schools/Madrasahs for\nwhich the minimum qualification was Honours Graduate and/or\nPost Graduate degree. The fixation of a higher qualification for\nsome posts and lower qualification for others, apparently had\nnothing to do with the teaching duties pertaining to the post, at\nleast at the material time.\n\n(23) It also appears that although there has recently been some\nchange in the rules of appointment through the School Service\nCommission, at the material time, Honours Graduates and Pass\nGraduates had to compete in a common selection test.\n\n(24) In the aforesaid circumstances, the payment of scale\npertaining to qualification to one teacher and denial of scale\npertaining to qualification to another teacher, teaching the same\nsubject in the same class in the same school or in different aided\nrecognized Non-Government schools would violate the principle of\nequal pay for equal work and offend\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution\nof India.\n(25) If the minimum requisite qualification for some posts of\nAssistant Teachers of Language Group was B. A. (Honours) and/or\nM. A degree, the minimum qualification for the teaching post for the\naforesaid category could have to be deemed as B.A.\n(Honours)/M.A. degree.\n\n(26) Mr. Bhattacharya, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the\nState cited a Division Bench judgment of this Court in\nTarak\nChandra Roy v. State of West Bengal and Ors.\n, reported in 2008(2)\nCalcutta Law Times 240 (HC).\n\n(27) In the aforesaid case, the Division Bench was of the view that\nafter the enforcement of the\nWest Bengal School Service\nCommission Act, 1997\n, the circulars dated 22nd November, 1993\nand 8th March, 2000 pertaining to teachers of Physical Education\nhad no manner of application.\n\n(28) There could be no doubt that the salary might be fixed on the\nbasis of scale of pay as mentioned by the School Service\nCommission, upon verification of mark sheets and certificates, as\nthere is s presumption of correctness in the same. However, in the\ninstant case, it appears that the School Service Commission has not\nrecorded the academic qualification of the petitioner correctly.\n\n(29) Be it noted that the Division Bench was concerned with the\ncase of a teacher of Physical Education. The requisite minimum\nqualification for all posts of teachers of Physical Education is pass\ngraduate. Therefore, no case was made out before the Division\nbench of discrimination between two sets of teachers performing\nthe same duties and functions and possessing the same\neducational qualification.\"\n239. Another Division Bench considered the same issues in Md.\n\nSohidullah & Ors. (FMA 583-585 of 2006) decided on 16th November, 2007\n\nand 22nd November, 2007.\n\n240. Three appeals were disposed of by\nthe said judgment\n. The writ\n\npetitioners were Md. Sohidullah, Smt. Nirupama Bairagi and Shyam Sundar\n\nMahanto.\n\n241. Sohidullah was a post graduate degree holder in Zoology. He\n\ncompeted for the post of assistant teacher in Zoology in pass graduate in the\n\nnorthern region. At the relevant time there were 13 main vacancies in\n\nHonors/Post graduate category. Although he was post graduate degree-\n\nholder, to secure the employment he competed for the pass category.\n\n242. Nirupama was B.SC (Hons.) in Geography and she also\n\ncompeted for the pass category and she was selected as such. She\n\nsubsequently obtained post graduate degree. However, she was not allowed\n\npost graduate scale of pay as she was not selected in Honors/Post graduate\n\ncategory to have the benefit of circular dated 3rd June, 2002.\n\n243. Shyam Sundor was a candidate under died-in-harness category,\n\nhe was admittedly pass graduate. He competed for the post in pass\n\ngraduate. He later improved his qualification by obtaining post graduate\n\ndegree. He passed out M.A. Part I from Burdwan University (correspondence\n\ncourse) prior to his selection in the post. After joining he applied for\n\npermission to sit for M.A. Part II examination. The Managing Committee\n\nforwarded his application to the DI Schools. The DI by a letter dated 13th\nJune, 2003 asked for qualification from the higher authority being Director\n\nof School Education. However, no such qualification had come from the said\n\nDirector. Shyam sat for the examination and successfully obtained post\n\ngraduate qualification. However, he was not given the benefit of higher scale\n\nof pay on the ground that he was selected in pass category.\n\n244. The learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition on the\n\nreasoning that there cannot be any discrimination between the teachers\n\nobtaining higher qualification being appointed prior to the School Service\n\nCommission Act coming into force and the teachers appointed through\n\nSchool Service Commission.\n\n245. On behalf of the writ petitioners it was argued that Circular\n\ndated 12th February, 1999, 13th July, 1999 and 13th June, 2002 are in the\n\nnature of incentives to the teaching staff who wanted to improve their\n\nqualifications and hence there cannot be any discrimination between the pre\n\n1997 appointees and post 1997 appointees.\n\n246. The staff pattern is for administrative convenience and cannot\n\nin any way deny equal pay for equal work and appropriate pay should be\n\ngiven in accordance with the admitted qualification. The discrimination,\n\nsought to be created by way of staff pattern violates the basic principles of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution and as such, is illegal.\n\n247. The circulars are ambiguous as it did not clearly extend the\n\nbenefit to the post 1997 appointees. Hence, beneficial interpretation should\n\nbe given in favour of the grantee being the teaching staff in question.\n248. On behalf of the State it was argued that the State as a matter\n\nof policy wanted to give incentives to teachers who wanted to acquire higher\n\nqualification for the betterment of the students at large, however, such\n\nbenefit is restricted to teaching staff appointed prior to the School Service\n\nCommission Act, 1997 coming into force. The government as a policy\n\ndecision categorized the post of teaching staff in different educational\n\ninstitutions.\n\n249. The State relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\n\nin\nHaryana v. Haryana Civil Secretariate Personal Staff Association\n\nreported in AIR 2002 SC 2589 where the writ petitioners have relied upon\n\nthe decision in\nGovernment of West Bengal v. Tarun Kumar Roy & Ors.\n\nreported in 2004 (\n1) SCC 347 and Union of India & Ors. v. Kaumudini\n\nNarayan Dalal & Anr.\n, reported in 2001 (10) SCC 231.\n\n250. The Hon'ble Division Bench has decided the appeal in favour of\n\nthe State save and except the matter relating to Shyam Sundor Mahato. The\n\nreasoning in short is that prior to the 1997 Act educational institutions\n\nshould appoint teaching and non teaching staff directly subject to the\n\napproval of State when aid was extended to such institutions by the State.\n\nAt the relevant time, for the teaching staff, graduation is the minimum\n\neligible qualification. The State has its financial constraints. It has to\n\nallocate funds as per revenue collection and other financial resources. When\n\nany financial benefit is extended by the State the State must have say in the\n\nsame matter. The State despite their constraint as a matter of policy wanted\n\nto give incentive to the teaching staff who were appointed prior to 1997\nappointees, so that they acquired higher qualification for the benefit of the\n\nstudents at large.\n\n251. The Hon'ble Division Bench did not find any ambiguity and/or\n\ninconsistency in the three circulars. In reference of the first circular dated\n\n12th February, 1999. It was observed:\n\n\"The first circular dated February 12, 1999 clearly provides that\nhigher pay scale would be given to the teaching staff who would\nimprove or have improved his/her qualification. It means, a\nteaching staff who had acquired higher qualification after his\nappointment, was only entitled to such benefit. This benefit was\ngiven with effect from January 1, 1996. Hence, School Service\nCommission appointees cannot come within the zone of\nconsideration in any way. In the second circular dated July 13,\n1999 it was provided that School Service Commission appointees\nwould get their pay fixation as per their qualification so intimated\nby the Commission. The benefit was also extended on and from\nJanuary 1, 1996 therein. The third circular makes it more clear\nwhere identical benefit was given for the post 1997 appointees\nwho appeared in post-graduate examination prior to appointment\nand was selected in Honours category and the result was not\npublished till his/her appointment.\n\nOn a combined reading of three circulars we feel that although\nShohidullah and Nirupama did have requisite higher qualification\nbeing postgraduate and honours, as the case may be, they chose\nto compete for the pass category. Hence, they are not entitled to\nthe benefit of the higher pay scale.\n\nThe State is funding the schools by providing inter alia the salary\nfor the teaching staff. They have their financial scheme through\ntheir annual budget. They prepare their budget as per financial\nresources they have in their hands. They, in their wisdom, wanted\nto give additional incentives to those teaching staff, who wanted\nto acquire higher qualification which would ultimately enure to the\nbenefit of the students at large. However, the teachers who\nalready had higher qualification and did not utilize such\nqualification at the time of entry in service, they cannot get benefit\nof those circulars and in our view, the State is right in denying\nsuch benefit to those teaching staff.\n\nIt is true that in the case of Sohidullah his qualification was not\nmentioned in the recommendation made by the Commission. We\nfeel that this was a mistake on the part of the Commission.\nShohidullah did disclose his postgraduate qualification in his\napplication. He however, despite mentioning such higher\nqualification, had chosen to compete in pass category. Hence, the\nCommission while recommending him should have mentioned his\npost-graduate qualification coupled with a note that he was\nselected in pass category as applied for.\n\nIn such view of the matter, Sohidullah is not entitled to claim\npostgraduate scale as he was selected in pass category on the\nbasis of his application. The learned Judge, in our view, erred in\nallowing the writ petition of Sohidullah.\n\nIn the case of Niruparna it is true that she obtained post-graduate\nqualification after she was selected for the post. She also despite\nhaving honours qualification, did choose to compete in pass\ncategory. Hence, she was also not entitled to benefit of the circular\ndated June 3, 2002. She had honours in Geography. She should\nhave competed in honours/post-graduate category. Had she done\nso, she would have been entitled to post-graduate scale after\nacquiring the same in course of her service.\nHence, in our view, Niruparna should also be denied post-\ngraduate scale on the same logic for which we deny benefit to\nSohidullah. We feel that the learned Judge erred in allowing her\nwrit application.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n252. The Hon'ble Division Bench has noted that in paragraph 9 and\n\n10 of the decision in the case of\nState of Haryana\n(supra) the Apex Court\n\nobserved that equation of post, determination of pay scale and other allied\n\ndecisions should be left to the executive and not open for judicial review.\n\n253.\nIn the case of\nGovernment of West Bengal\n(supra) the Apex\n\nCourt in paragraph 14 of the decision observed, \"the holders of a higher\n\neducational qualification can be treated as a separate class. Such\n\nclassification, it is trite, is reasonable. Employees performing the similar job\n\nbut having different educational qualification can, thus, be treated\n\ndifferently.\"\n\n254. The Hon'ble Division Bench has also noted that the three\n\ncirculars have not been challenged by the writ petitioners. We are of the view\n\nthat ratio in Md. Sohidullah & Ors has correctly interpreted the aforesaid\n\nthree circulars.\n\n255. A Hon'ble Bench in FMA 557 of 2007 (\nBaisali Banerjee v. The\n\nState of West Bengal & Ors.\ndecided on 10th March, 2008) had considered\n\nthe claim of a post graduate degree holder in physical education for a higher\n\nscale of pay. At the time of her selection for the post of physical education\n\nher post graduate result was yet to be published.\n256. The School Service Commission recommended her as a physical\n\neducation teacher as a pass graduate. After declaration of result she applied\n\nfor higher scale of pay which was denied by the State. Identical question\n\narose in Bhaskar Chakrabory v. State of West Bengal & Ors. (W.P.2326\n\n(W) of 2002) allowing the writ petition and directed the extension of post\n\ngraduate scale of pay to the writ petitioner who was identically\n\ncircumstanced with Baisali. The State accepted the said order and extended\n\nthe benefit to Bhaskar.\n\n257. The State has objected to the grant of higher scale of pay in view\n\nof\nSection 14\nof 2005 Act as the qualification recorded by the School Service\n\nCommission and mentioned in the respective letters of recommendation\n\nmentioned Baisali as a pass graduate. The prayer of Baisali was allowed on\n\nthe following reasoning:\n\n\"Prior to 1996 the State from time to time extended the benefit\nof higher pay scale to the teachers who acquired post graduate\nqualification in course of service. Initially such extension was\nrestricted to subject relevant to his/her teaching. The said rule\nwas relaxed and the post graduate degree holders, being pre-\n1996 appointees were all extended post graduate scale. Such\nbenefit was given by the State probably to encourage the\nteaching staff to improve their qualification for the welfare of the\nstudent. Our attention has not been drawn to any other reason\nfor extension of such benefit by the State counsel. If that be the\nposition there could not be any distinction between Pre 1096\nappointees and Post 1996 appointees.\nThe appellant is a Physical Education teacher. There is no\nhonours course taught by any of the Universities in the State.\nHence there could be no such category in the School Service\nCommission in the concerned subject. We also do not find any\nsuch distinction being made in Physical Education by the\nSchool Service Commission. Hence all candidates who are\nhaving appropriate qualification in Physical Education are\nconsidered in one category i.e. pass category. If that be the\nposition their subsequent acquisition of post graduate\nqualification cannot be equated with any other subject.\n\nIn the instant case the appellant undertook post graduate\nstudy. She appeared in the post graduate examination. Before\nthe result could be published she was selected and appointed\nin the post.\nIn the case of\nBhaskar Chakraborty\n(supra) the\nidentical situation happened. Hence in our view, the appellant\nwas entitled to the benefit of the higher pay scale.\n\nLet us now examine the said Act of 2005 to find out whether\nthere is any hindrance in the way of extending higher pay scale\nto the appellant. Appellant was appointed in 2001. She\nacquired post graduate qualification in 2001. Hence she was to\nbe considered contemporarily. Her case was unnecessary kept\npending. Her prayer could not be considered to her\ndisadvantage under the provisions of the said Act of 2005 in\nthis regard. Learned Counsel appearing for the appellant has\nsuccessfully drawn our attention to\nSection 16\nwherein it is\nprovided that notwithstanding anything contained in the said\nAct, the terms and conditions of service of a teacher shall not be\nvaried to his or her disadvantage in the view of the\ncommencement of the said Act.\n\nIn Circular dated June 03, 2002 the State considered the cases\nof the candidates who were undergoing post graduate studies\nor had appeared at the post graduate examination but result\nwas yet to be published. Those candidates, if selected, in\nhonours category were extended post graduate scale after\nacquiring post graduate qualification. Since in Physical\nEducation there is no such distinction between pass category\nand honours category the benefit of the circular dated June 03,\n2602 should be extended to the Physical Education teachers\nbeing similarly circumstanced with\nBhaskar Chakraborty\n\n(supra) and the present appellant.\n\nThe State is directed to consider the prayer for extension of the\nhigher pay scale in the light of the observations made herein.\"\n\n258. In our considered opinion the acquiring of higher qualification\n\ndoes not create a fundamental right nor does it create a vested right.\n\n259.\nIn\nZahoor Ahmad Rather & Ors. v. Sheikh Imtiyaz Ahmad\n\nand Ors.\nreported in (2019) 2 SCC 404 in discussing the scope of judicial\n\nreview in policy matter involving prescribed qualifications it was held:\n\n\"26...It is no part of the role or function of judicial review to\nexpand upon the ambit of the prescribed qualifications. Similarly,\nequivalence of a qualification is not a matter which can be\ndetermined in exercise of the power of judicial review. Whether a\nparticular qualification should or should not be regarded as\nequivalent is a matter for the State, as the recruiting authority, to\ndetermine...\n\n27. While prescribing the qualifications for a post, the State, as\nemployer, may legitimately bear in mind several features\nincluding the nature of the job, the aptitudes requisite for the\nefficient discharge of duties, the functionality of a qualification\nand the content of the course of studies which leads up to the\nacquisition of a qualification. The State is entrusted with the\nauthority to assess the needs of its public services. Exigencies of\nadministration, it is trite law, fall within the domain of\nadministrative decision-making. The State as a public employer\nmay well take into account social perspectives that require the\ncreation of job opportunities across the societal structure. All\nthese are essentially matters of policy. Judicial review must tread\nwarily...\"\n\n260.\nIn\nThe State of West Bengal v. Ganesh Chandra Samanta\n\nand Ors.\n, decided on 29th November, 2023 a Division Bench constituting of\n\none of us (Soumen Sen, J.) in considering the claim of the appellant\n\nWorkshop Instructors for higher scale of pay under ROPA Rules, 1981 on\n\nthe principle of equal pay for equal work observed:\n\n\"86. The Courts have consistently held that even if the nature of\nthe work involved in two posts may sometime appear to be more\nor less similar, however, if the classification of the posts and\ndetermination of pay scale have reasonable nexus with the\nobjective or purpose sought to be achieved, the pay commissions\nwould be justified in recommending and the State would be\njustified in prescribing different pay scale for the seemingly similar\nposts.\n\n87.The power of judicial review in the matter involving financial\nimplications are also very limited. The Courts have over the\nyears given due credence to the wisdom of the pay commission\nand not interfered with such policy matters involving financial\nimplications unless a gross case of arbitrariness or unfairness\nare established.\n88. The principle of equal pay for equal work has no mechanical\napplication in every case and\nArticle 14\npermits reasonable\nclassification based on qualities or characteristics of persons\nrecruited and grouped together as against those who have left\nout. A classification based on difference in educational\nqualifications and processes of recruitment justify a difference\nin pay scale. (see\nState of Bihar vs. Bihar Secondary\nTeachers Struggle Committee\nreported in (2019) 18 SCC\n\n301).\"\n\n261. When the post for which appointment is made, does not require\n\na candidate with Honours or Post graduate degree the state cannot be\n\nsaddled with the financial burden of paying enhanced scale of pay for\n\nteachers with higher qualification. In fact candidates with Honours\n\ngraduate/post graduate category would be over qualified for the classes for\n\nwhich they are appointed based on staff pattern. It was for this reason while\n\nlaying down the eligibility criteria the authorities take into consideration the\n\nsuitability of the candidate for the post.\n\n262. The State is required to make budgetary allocation to meet\n\nsalaries and other allowances extended to teachers. The State cannot be\n\nasked to pay enhanced scale of pay to a teacher for acquiring higher\n\nqualification in the course of his employment or who had consciously\n\nparticipated in a selection process which does not require a higher\n\nqualification for the said post. If a teacher has consciously applied for a post\n\nunder the pass graduate category in spite of having an Honours\n\nGraduate/Post Graduate qualification he/she/they cannot claim as a matter\n\nof right higher pay scale in view of the Government Orders dated 13th July,\n1999. Re-fixation of salary has to be decided on the basis of the extant\n\nrules. The change in policy if not arbitrary or affecting a vested right or a\n\nfundamental right should not be interfered with keeping in mind that such\n\nchange in policy has been necessitated by reason of change in\n\ncircumstances. An expert body conversant with the relevant rules, realities\n\nand requirements of the students and educational institutions has framed\n\nrules. Statutory orders have been issued to implement the Act and the rules\n\nframed thereunder.\n\n263. The re-fixation of higher scale of pay as considered in Sauvik\n\nwas possibly confused with a claim for increments or incentives which may,\n\nin a given circumstance, be considered not on the basis of a fundamental or\n\na legally enforceable right but on an expectation.\n\n264. If one scrutinized the ROPAs since 1970s and the several\n\ngovernment orders issued in between it would appear that the government\n\nhas emphasized that the higher qualification should be in the relevant\n\nsubject with few exceptions like Government order dated 27th January, 1995\n\nextending certain financial benefits by way of increment to Assistant teacher\n\nalleging higher scale of pay even if their initial appointments were in\n\ndifferent group/subject which we feel was issued primarily to mitigate the\n\nhardship caused to the educational institutions and the students by reason\n\nof delay in approving teachers in time.\n\n265. The claim of higher pay scale on acquiring higher degree cannot\n\nbe considered to be a vested right and elevated to a legal right. It is no more\nthan a reasonable expectation. However, such expectation must arise from\n\nthe course of dealings and conducts.\n\n266. The State Government has recognized CAS which is in the\n\nnature of incentives which can be extended to teachers acquiring higher\n\nqualification but it cannot be claimed as a matter of right. The state has to\n\nassess if on acquisition of higher qualification by a teacher it would benefit\n\nthe educational institutions and the students.\n\n267. It is true that while the teacher may not claim as a matter of\n\nright that having joined the institution in the pass graduate category he\n\nwould be entitled to receive higher scale of pay at par with teachers who\n\nhave been recruited for the Honours graduate/Post graduate category in\n\nview of different recruitment rules and object and purpose for such\n\nrecruitment, however, can claim, a reasonable approach from the State to\n\nconsider suitable increments in view of stagnation and lack of opportunity\n\nfor promotion. Undoubtedly, a teacher with a better and higher qualification\n\ncan be an advantage to an educational institution and it is expected that the\n\nteacher should not be deprived of increments and/or incentives.\n\n268. At the same time as we have observed earlier, it cannot\n\nencourage a backdoor entry for teachers who have joined in the pass\n\ngraduate category and thereafter on improvement of their qualification claim\n\nhigher scale of pay.\n\n269. Even if the School Service Commission records the qualification\n\nof a candidate as Honours graduate for the recruitment in the pass graduate\ncategory, the recommendation in a pass graduate category by the\n\nCommission can only be for the said category for the simple reason that for\n\nthe said post, Honours and/or Post graduate category candidates are not\n\nrequired and the recruitment process for Honours/Post graduate category is\n\ndifferent.\n\n270. There could be instances where an Honours graduate or post\n\ngraduate candidate may suppress qualification and participate in the\n\nselection process in the pass graduate category and take the easy path and\n\navoid competing with candidates who are Honours graduate and/or Post\n\ngraduate for the selection to Honours and/or Post graduate category with\n\nthe hope to utilize such degree after joining to claim higher scale of pay.\n\n271. The prospective operation of the 2005 Act would also be clear\n\nfrom\nSection 14(3)\nof the 2005 Act. All other circulars existing prior to the\n\n2005 Act in relation to financial benefits upon acquiring higher qualification\n\nare required to be considered in accordance with rules existing when an\n\napplication seeking permission for pursuing higher education and\n\nrecommendation of the Managing Committee is made. The rights of the\n\nparties are required to be decided on the basis of the Government order and\n\ncirculars existing on that date.\nThe Act\ndoes not take away such right as the\n\nsaid Act is prospective in nature. The said provision cannot affect any right\n\nthat has accrued or crystallized in favour of a teacher on the basis of the\n\ngovernment order or circulars issued prior to the 1997 Act has come into\n\noperation.\n272. On the basis of the aforesaid discussion we answer the\n\nreference in the manner following:\n\na). Enhancement of pay on acquisition of higher qualification\nduring the service career is dependent upon the relevant rules\noperating at the time of acquisition of higher qualification and\ncannot be claimed as a matter of right in absence of Rules.\n\nFor example, a teacher joined the school with a pass graduate\ndegree and during his service career the teacher enhanced his\nqualification and claimed higher scale of pay on the basis of the\nsaid degree. The said claim has to be decided on the basis of the\nrelevant rules existing at the time of his acquiring higher\nqualification. If he has joined the school with a pass graduate\ndegree after the government circular dated 12th February, 1999 he\nwould not be entitled to post graduate scale of pay unless the\nteacher is covered by the Government Order No. 735-SE(S)/SP-\n132/2002 as revised by the Circular No.134-SE(S) dated 3rd\nNovember, 2004. Any other interpretation would encourage a back\ndoor entry. A teacher upon acquiring higher qualification can\nalways compete in the recruitment process for a post\ncommensurate with the higher qualification and therefore the\nquestion of stagnation does not arise. However, the State shall\nformulate a scheme for incentives to teachers who may have joined\nthe school with a pass graduate degree but enhanced his/her\nqualification with the permission of the Managing Committee and\nthe D.I irrespective of the staff pattern as such incentive would\nencourage teachers to perform better and it will act as a cushion\nagainst stagnation.\n\nb) We answered the question in the negative.\n\nc) Vires of Section 14 and 20 of the West Bengal School (Control\nand Expenditure, Act), 2005 is not under challenge. The ground of\nchallenge was that persons who have received benefits earlier\nunder court orders or by the government, could they have been\ndenied similar benefits to persons similarly placed. In absence of\npleading to the effect that the said Rules are ultra vires this issue\ncannot be decided. [See\nUnion of India v. E.I.D. Parry (India)\nLtd.\n2000(2) SCC 223]\n\nd) We are of the view that\nTarak Chandra Roy\n(supra) has been\ncorrectly decided.\n\nWe are of the view that\nTarak Chandra Roy\n\n(supra) has to be read along with the Government Order dated 3rd\nJune, 2002. However\n,\nthe said judgment\nhas to be read with the\nOrder No.735-SE(S) SP-132/2002 as revised by the Circular\nNo.134-SE(S) dated 3rd March, 2004. The said judgment has also\nto be read in terms of the interpretation of the said two\ngovernment orders in this judgement.\n\ne) The reference of Nirmaledu (supra) is answered in the negative\nwith the qualification as provided in answers to question (a) and\n\n(d) above.\n\nf) In respect of\nAnupam Santra\n(supra) and\nChandra Bhusan\nDwivedi\n(supra) we are of the view that the date of convocation is\nnot relevant for the purpose of entitlement to higher scale of pay.\nThe relevant date would be the declaration and/or publication of\nresults and the teacher should be entitled to draw pay of post\ngraduate teacher category in terms of Government Order\nNo.1595-SE(S) dated 26th December, 2005.\n\ng) If a teacher has partially completed higher study before entering\nservice he/she would come under purview of G.O. No.1595-SE(S)\ndated 26th December, 2005 and the question of taking permission\nfrom DIS-SE concerned would not arise.\n\nh) With regard to the effect of omission of Clause/Rule 12(5) of\nGovernment Order No. 25-SE(B)/IM-102/98 dated 12th\nFebruary, 1999 in G.O. No.46/SE(B)/1/2009 dated 27th\nFebruary, 2009 we are of the view that the Government Order\ndated 27th February, 2009 cannot operate retrospectively and take\naway the benefits available under the Rule/Rules in force at that\ntime. The said Rule cannot be given effect to invalidate benefits\ngranted to the employees under Clause 12(5) of the Government\nOrder dated 12th February, 1999. However, with regard to the\nbenefits to be enjoyed under the Government Order dated 12th\nFebruary, 1999 vis-a-vis the Government Order dated 27th\nFebruary, 2009 the ratio in\nMala Sanyal\n(supra) shall be followed.\n\n273. The reference is answered accordingly.\n\nI agree (Soumen Sen, J.)\n\n(Harish Tandon, J.)\n\nI agree\n\n(Kausik Chanda, J.)",
