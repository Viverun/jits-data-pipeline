Briefly stated the facts\n ts as adumbrated by the applicant that Shri\nRama Sah husband of the applicant was initially appointed in year 1981 as\n\n 2 OA 1109/2019\n\ncasual labour at Bankipore Head Post Office. The husband of applicant wass\nconferred temporary status w.e.f. 01.08.2000 vide order dated 26.03.2001\n(Annexure\n(Annexure-A-1).\n\n . The husband of the applicant submitted written\nrepresen\nrepresentations dated 2.9.13, 29.06.2018 and 19.04.2019 to regularize as\nM.T.S.\nM.T.S.-Group 'D' post. Meanwhile applicant retired on 30.06.2018 as\ntemporary status on attaining sixty years of age. The husband of applicant\nworking as temporary status since 1.08.2000 and drawn minimum pay\nscale of group 'D' post of M.T.S., G.P.F. deductions were also regularly\nmade etc. The husband\n band of applicant left with no option and filed present\nO.A. on 28.11.2019. The respondents did not pay pension etc. and\napplicant husband left the world on 28.05.2022 leaving applicant legal heir\n heir--\n\nwife. The Tribunal on 10.02.2023 allowed M.A. to bring leg\n legal\n al heir on\nrecord.\n\n SUBMISSIONS\n\n4. Per contra, respondents have contested the claim of applicant by\nfiling written statement, wherein they have submitted that the husband of\nthe applicant initially appointed in year 1982 casual labour and granted\ntemporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000.\n\n \n1.8.2000. The husband of the applicant while\nworking as temporary status stood retired\n retired on 30.06.2018. The husband of\nthe applicant could not be regularized due to limited number of vacancies to\nextend of 25 percent of total vacancies. The applicant stood retired while\nworking as temporary status without regularization of services in re\n regular\n gular\ncadre. Hence not entitled to receive pension and\n nd pensionary benefits\naccordance with Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1972 ( Now Civil\nServices (Pension) Rules 2021). The applicant retired as temporary status\npaid from contingencies fund and as per Rule 2 (b) & (c) of Pension Rules,\n1972 said rules not applicable to applicant\n applicant.. The Central Civil Services\n(Temporary Service) Rules 1965 (in short\n short-Rules 1965) also not applicable\nto applicant. So also in similar case of \nUnion of India versus Bhikhanii\nDevi, CWJV No.\n 15420 of 2019 decided on 14.10.2019 by Hon'ble High\nCourt Patna. The Hon'ble Court Patna in above case set aside order dated\n27.3.2018 of the Tribunal and allowed the writ application.\n\n5. The rejoinder has been filed by the applicant specifically\n ally denying\nthe contentions of respondents made in the written statement has stated that\npoor casual labourer was conferred temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and\nrendered eighteen years and five months in Temporary Status. The\napplicant cannot be made to suffer for lapses on part of respondents for\n\n 3 OA 1109/2019\n\nnot being regularized. The applicant's husband services deserves to be\ntreated regularized and services be counted as qualifying service\n service.. The\ntemporary employee entitled for at par benefits of Group 'D' employee on\nregular basis. So also applicant case is squarely covered by law \nlaid down\nin\n similar facts and issue in O.A. No. 143/2018 \nAwadhesh Prasad Singh\nVs Union of India & Ors\n decided on 28.10.2021 and affirm by Hon'ble\nHigh Court Patna.\n\n6. Shri S.K. Tiwary, Learned Counsel appearing for applicant argued\nthat applicant husband was initially appointed in year 1982 as Casual\nlabour. Since 1.8.2000 Temporary Status conferred accordance with\nstatutory scheme, Department of Posts, G\nstatutory Govt. of India. The Para 8 of\nScheme dated 12.04.1991 and policy dated 30.11.1992 Department of\nPosts, Govt. of India provides after rendering three years of continuous\nservice with temporary status the casual labour shall be treated at par with\ntemporary Group 'D' employee of the Department\n epartment of Posts and entitled to\nsuch benefits as are admissible to Group D employees on regular basis. So\nalso contended that the applicant\n applicant is temporary Group 'D' employee quasi\npermanent status of Department of Post after three years from date of gr\n grant\n ant\nof temporary status.\n\n statu The scheme dated 12.04.1991 and policy dated\n30.11.1992 Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021 is\nenforceable in law and vested legal enforceable right accrued to applicant\nentitled for benefits at par of regular Group 'D' employee of the\nDepartment of the Post Government of India. So also Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in case Jagrit Mazdoor Union Vers\n Versus\n us Mahanagar Telephone\nNigam Ltd\n Ltd reported in 1990 Supp SCC 113 dated 29.11.1989 issued\ndirections in compliance thereof the of Department of Post, Government of\nIndia issued Policy and Scheme known as casual Labourers (Grant\n Grant of\nTemporary Status and Regularization) Scheme and it provides that after\nrendering three years of continuous service as temporary status be treated at\npar with Group 'D' employee regular basis and entitled to such benefits as\nare admissible to regular Group 'D' employee of the department of posts.\nHence applicant is entitled to relief claimed accordance with schemes, Rule\n le\nof Rules 1965 and CCS Pension Rules 1972 ((Now Central Civil Services\nPension Rules 2021).\n\n \n2021 . So also law \nlaid down by\n Hon'ble High Court Patna\nin similar case of \nUnion of India & ors vs Meena Devi @ Meena\nKunwar\n was 2003 (1) PLJR 506 decided on 8.12.2022 with all\nconsequential benefits. The right accrues to the applicant as per Rule 10 of\n\n 4 OA 1109/2019\n\nRules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules 2021 hence present OA deserves\nto be allowed. .\n\n7. Shri H.P.Singh, Learned CGSC alongwith Shri Deepak Kumar,,\nLearned Additional Standing\n ding Counsel appearing for the respondents\nargued that applicant husband had retired on 30.06.2018 after completing\n60 years of age as temporary status casual labour and never had been\nfollowed by regular appointment in the cadre. So also the scheme dated\n12.04.1991 and policy dated 30.11.1992 issued by Department of Posts had\nto be construed that there is no automatic appointment of temporarily status\nafter three years to a regular Group D Post. The appli\n applicant\n cant husband never\nbeen absorbed and not appointed on any substantive post in the regular\ncadre accordance with scheme. So also Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nSecretary, State of Karnataka Versus Uma Devi, (2006) 4 SCC 1 held that\n\"merely\n merely because a temporary\n temporary employee, casual wage worker could not\nclaim to be made permanent on the ground because continued for a long\ntime\".. So also contended that applicant not entitled for any benefits under\nPension Rules 1972, Rules 1965 and in case of Union of India Verses\nBhikha Devi,, CWJC No. 15420 of 2019, Hon'ble High Court Patna on\nBhikhani\nsimilar facts decided on 14.10.2019 allowed writ application filed by\nrespondents and set-aside order dated 27.3.2018 passed by this Tribunal.\nHence the present OA deserves to be dismissed.\n\n dismissed.\n\n8. No other point is pressed at the Bar by the learned counsel appearing\nfor both the parties.\n\n9. This Tribunal has bestowed anxious considerations on the rival\ncontentions of the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the\nmaterial placed on record.\n\n10. The admitted fact are that husband of the applicant initially\nappointed in year 1982 as casual\n casual labourer and conferred temporary status\nwith effect from 1.8.2000. On completing age of sixty years retired from\nservice on 30.06.2018. Since 1982 to 1.8.2000 worked as casual labourer\nand since 1.8.2000 to 30.06.2018 served as temporary status not appointed\n nted\non substantive appointment and left the world on 28.05.2022.\n\n11. The dispute in the present case is that respondents have taken stand\nthat the husband of applicant worked in the Department\n epartment of Posts, Govt. of\nIndia as casual labourer from year 1982 to 1.8.2000.. Thereafter as per\nstatutory scheme and policy of Department of Posts, Govt. of India\nconferred temporary status with effect from 01.8.2000 vide order dated\n\n 5 OA 1109/2019\n\n26.4.2001 (Annexure A-1).. The husband of applicant also rendered services\nas temporary status\n status from 1.8.2000 to 31.6.2018 and retired on 31.06.2018\nas temporary status employee. The further stand of the respondent\n respondent--\n\ndepartment is that till retirement applicant was not regularized in services of\nregular cadre and was not holding substantive appointment on any post in\nthe regular service cadre. Hence in absence of regularization of services in\nregular cadre till time of retirement on 31.06.2018. The husband of the\napplicant not eligible for pension,\n pension, family pension and othe\n otherr pensionary\nbenefits as qualifying services of ten years can only be counted under CCS\nPension Rules provided temporary services is followed by uninterrupted\n upted\nsubstantive appointment.\n\n appointment\n THE ISSUE\n\n12. From the above submissions of the learned counsel for the parties\nand material placed on record. The admitted fact that applicant husband\njoined services\n services as casual labour in year 1982. Thereafter conferred\ntemporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 rendering continuous long, efficient\nservice all his active life till retired\n retired on 30.06.2018. The core issue arises\nbefore this Tribunal for determination is:-\n\n is:-\n\n \" Whether deceased employee who was appointed as a casual\n lobourer and thereafter conferred the status of temporary employee\n w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and retired on 30.6.2018 and hi his legal heir-Naina\n Devi is entitled to benefit of pension/family pension or not?\"\n\n ANALYSIS\n\n13.

Before examining the core issue framed. This Tribunal would first\n deal with binding precedent some of the various judgments settled the\n law on the similar facts and the issue involved not been referred to higher\n bench.. So also judgments dealing with pari\n pari-materia\n materia provisions related to\n same category of employees as under:-\n\n under:\n\n (i)) The Hon'ble Supreme Court interpreting the scheme and\n policies as applicable in present\n esent O.A. of Department of Post in\n three judge Bench decision in case of Jagrit Mazdoor Union and\n ors. versus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. And ors in W.P.\n No. 1119, 1276, 1623 and 1624 of 1986 decided on 29.11.1989\n reported in 1990 Supp SCC 113 has observed :-\n\n \" The writ petitioner in W.P. No. 1624/1986 working as substitute\n employees and casual labourers in the Department of Posts, Govt.\n of India claimed relief to treat at par with regular employees and be\n paid same emoluments as regular employ employees. The Hon'ble\n Supreme Court in Para 11 directed as under:\n\n under:-\n\n \" 11 The Temporary Status would be available to the casual\n labourers in the Postal Department on completion of one year\n continuous service with at least 240 days of work (2036 days in the\n case of officers observing five days week) and on conferment of\n temporary status, House Rent Allowance and City Compensatory\n Allowance shall be admissible. There would be no justification to\n withhold Maternity Leave as that is an obligation of the employer\n under the law and the state as aan ideal employer fulfilling the\n Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in Part\n Part-IV of the\n Constitution should provide the same. After rendering three years\n of continuous service with temporary status, the casual labouers\n shall be treated at par with temporary Grade 'D' employees of the\n Department of Posts and would thereby be entitled to such\n benefits as are admissible to Group \"D\" employees on regular\n basis.\" [ Emphasis supplied]\n\n(ii) The Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Ben\n Bench\n h in case of\n Yashwant Hari Katakkar Versus Union of India reported in\n (1996) 7 SCC 113, dealing with question for determination \"\n\n whether appellant is entitled to any pensionary benefits since total\n service of moree than eighteen years was in quasi--\n permanent/temporary The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held :-\n\n permanent/temporary.\"\n\n \" 3. Dr. Anand Prakash, learned Senior Advocate appearing for\n the union of India, has contended that on 7.3.1980 when the\n appellant was prematurely retired he had put in 18 ½ years of\n quasi-permanent\n permanent service. According to him to earn pension it was\n necessary to have a minimum of 120 years of permanent service.\n\n It is contended that since the total service of the appellant was\n in quasi-permanent capacity he was not enlisted to the pensionary\n benefits.\n\n There is nothing on record to show as to why the appellant\n was not made permanent even when he had served the Government\n for 18 ½ years. It would be travesty of justice if the appellant is\n denied the pensionary benefits simply on the ground that he was not\n a permanent employee of the government\n government. The appellant having\n served the government for almost-two two decades it would be unfair to\n treat him as temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\n permanent.\n\n 10 OA 1109/2019\n\n Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of this case we hold\n that the appellant shall be deemed to have become permanent after\n he served the Government for or such a long period.

The department of posts vide instruction\ndated 17.5.1989 clarified that all daily wagers working in post offices are to\nbe treated as casual labourers. The department of posts has made Scheme\nknown as Casual Labourers (Gran\n (Grant of Temporary Status and\nRegularization) Scheme effective from 1.10.1989. The scheme provided\nprovisions for conferment of temporary status to casual labourers. So also\nthe scheme specified advantages at part with Group 'D' regular employee\navailable on conferment of status of temporary employee.\n\n 16 OA 1109/2019\n\n18. The casual labourers in the Department of Posts filed writ petition\nbefore Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nJagrit MazdoorUnion and\nors versus Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.\n 1990 Supp. SCC 113\nseeking relief that substitutes and casual labourers of Department of Posts\nbe paid same emoluments as regular employees. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt held that temporary status would be available to the casual labourers\nin the postal department on completion of one year of continuous service\nwith at least 240 days of work and on conferment of temporary status\n status. The\nstate as an ideal employer fulfilling the Directive Principles of state policy\nshould treat similarly with regular employees in the department.\n\n \nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court, three Judge Bench\n ench in \nJagrit\nMazdoor Union\n (supra) decided on 29.11.1989 also held as under :-\n\n \"After rendering three years of continuous service with\n temporary status, the casual labourers shall be treated at part with\n temporary Grade 'D'' employees of the Department of Posts and\n would thereby be entitled to such benefits as are admissible to Group\n 'D' employees on regular basis.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied)\n\n19. \nIn compliance with directions of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case\nof \nJagrit Mazdoor Union\n (supra). The\n he Department of Posts, Government\nof India formulated scheme known as Casual Labourers (Grant of\nTemporary Status and Regularization) Scheme dated 12th April, 1991 and\nscheme has been drawn up by the Department in consultation wi\n with\n th\nMinistry of Law, Finance and Personnel and his Excellency the President of\nIndia has been graciously pleased to approve with intention to provide\nbenefits to casual labourers working continuously for long period.\n\n20. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having bi\n binding\n nding statutory force, social\nand beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to extend\nbenefits to long continuous working of casual labourers\n labourers.\n\n21. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 confers temporary status on casual\nlabourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant is appointee of\nyear 1982 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize and ought to\nhave been superannuated before 30.6.2018 accordance with law as regular\nemployee for no fault of applicant made\n made to suffer violating \nArticle 14\n, 21\n 21\n,\n,\n31A\n and 3000 of the Constitution of India. .\n\n22. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000\npurusnt to order dated 26.4.2001 (Annexure A\n A-1) and the statutory binding\nscheme has conferred certain\n in advantages to temporary employee as\n\n 17 OA 1109/2019\n\nprovided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the pay scale for a regular\ngroup'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.

The legislative\nintent is clear as noon day in formulating the statutor\n statutoryy scheme dated\n12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to\nenforce the terms as social legislation to enhance social welfare and\nachieve social justice.\n\n justice The\n he Central Government being an ideal employer\nfulfilling the Directive Principles\n Principles of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV\nof the Constitution of India treating temporary status casual labour after\nlong period at par with temporary Group 'D' employee of the Department\ngranting benefits and treating at par with and entitled for ssuch\n uch benefits as\nare admissible to the Group 'D' employee on regular basis\n basis.

So also\nthe scheme to be construed as social beneficial legislation with harmonious\nconstruction. So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for\nconferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering three years\ncontinuous service as temporary status.\n\n23. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 1.8.2000 and\naccordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\nconstruction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after\nthree\n ree years since 1.8.2000 meaning thereby since 2.8.2003 has attained\nstatus of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to\nG.P.F. The applicant husband was in capacity of temporary employee.\nThe husband of the applicant having continuously worked as temporary\nstatus casual labourer since 1.8.2000 and on 2.8.2003 is holder of post of\ntemporary employee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly\nby the model employer state accordance with guarantee en\n enshrined\n shrined in the\n\nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of the Constitution of India. This Tribunal is of the view\nwhereof that It's unfair to continue husband of the applicant such a long in\ntemporary post and without considering for regularizing till retirement.\n\n 18 OA 1109/2019\n\n24. The applicant\n plicant acquired status of temporary employee Group 'D' of\nDepartment of Posts and it is well settled in law that entitled for such\nbenefits as are admissible to Group 'D' employees on regular basis\n basis. So\n o\nalso held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJagrit Mazd\n Mazdoor Union\n (supra).\n\n25. The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory terms\nno recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual labourers\navailable to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have not\ndischarged statutory duty\n du as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P. Part\nIV of the Constitution of India and applicant husband not regularized as for\nno fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not\ndischarge his duty and not regularized on time for own mista\n mistakes\n kes\nrespondents cannot take advantages and plea not even considered for\nregularization available to them that since no regularization no pension etc\n etc.\n\n26. The husband of the applicant before retirement submitted\nrepresentation dated 2.9.2013 (Annexure A\n A-2)\n\n 2) dated 29.6.2018 (Annexure\nA-3)\n\n 3) dated 19.4.2019 (Annexure A-4)\n A 4) to allow to participate in absorption\nto regularize services on regular cadre post of M.T.S but no response. The\nrespondents have stated in Para 7 of the written statement that applicant\ncould not be provided opportunity for regularization as Group 'D'/MTS\nthrough selection in view of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual\nlabourers. The\n The Para 7 of written statement and averments of para 4.4 of\nOA that respondents not regularized services of applicant remains\nunrebutted. The applicant was never at fault for such lack of regularization.\n\n27. This Tribunal considering the specific averments made by applicant\nin Para 4.4. of the O.A that respondents have not regularized services as\nMTS as per law on time, inspite of written requests filed as Annexure A\n A-2,\n 2,\nA-3\n 3 and A-4\n A 4 and retired on 30.6.2018 without being regularized. The\nrespondents in para 7 of written statement not adverted to specific\nallegation and not specifically denied as per requirement in Rule 3,4, and 5\nof the order VIII \nof Code of Civil Procedure\n\n Procedure.. This Tribunal is of the view\nsince respondents state failed to discharge his statutory duty as per the\nScheme dated 12.4.1991 and not even once considered for regularization\nsince 1982.\n\n 1982 Hence respondents cannot take advantage of own mistakes and\nlatches to deny retirement benefits as not regularized deceased employee\nbefore retirement.\n\n retir The matter of right, right accrued pursuant to the scheme\n\n 19 OA 1109/2019\n\nand policy applicable to applicant and he ought to have at least considered\nfor regularization before date of superannuation. The applicant worked\nsince 1982 to 30.6.2018 almost thirty five years and six months in the\ndepartment\n\n28. The department of posts issued clarifications some of reproduced\nherein above enumerating advantages of temporary employee. So also\npolicy dated 30.11.1992 Government of India, Department of Posts G.I.\n(5). Benefits of casual labourers on completion of three years service in\ntemporary status reproduced herein\n herein above. The vested legal right accrued to\nthe deceased employee in light of statutory scheme and policies and can not\nbe taken away by respondents. The Department o Posts, Ministry of\nTelecommunication & I.T. Union of India formulated policy dated\n12.4.1991,\n .1991, 30.11.1992 and failure of implementation results in failure of\nsocial-economic\n economic justice.\n\n justice. So also envisaged in D.P.S.\n D.P.S.P. Part IV of\nConstitution. These policy, scheme circulars are substantive attemp\n attemptss to\nenhance social welfare. The respondents denied to deceased employee\naccrued rights and has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous\nroads to justice. Hence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no\npensionry benefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied\nrelief claimed.\n\n cla\n\n29. The sub-clause\n clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5\n (5)) policy dated 30.11.1992\nquoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of the postal\ndepartment with effect from date of completion three years of service in\nnewly acquired temporary status\n status becomes entitled to benefits admissible to\ntemporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service for purpose of\npension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary employees appointed\non regular basis while granting them pension and retirement bene\n benefits\n fits after\ntheir regularization.\n\n30. The Conditions of Service of temporary government servants are\nregulated\n ted by Rules 1965 relevant rules already extracted herein above. The\nRule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 provides for grant of family pension and death\ngratuity to family of deceased temporary employee under same provisions\nas are applicable to the permanent civilian government servants under the\nCCS Pension Rules 1972 (Now CCS Pension Rules, 2021). The claim\n m for\npension and benefits accrued accordance with Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read\n\n 20 OA 1109/2019\n\nwith Rules 2 CCS Pension Rules 2021. The Temporary employee retired\nwithout substantive appointment are held entitled for pension etc as per\nRules 1965 and Rules 2021.\n\n31. The CCS\n S Rules 1972 has been repealed CCS Pension Rules 2021 as\nextracted herein above. So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where excludes\ntemporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension Rules\n ules\n2021 are applicable to those temporary employee like appl\n applicant. So also the\nexplanation no. 6 to Rule 2 provides - these rules shall also apply to (6)\ncases of government servants appointed in temporary capacity to civil\nservices and posts in connection with affairs of the Union on or before 31st\nDecember, 2003, who retired or were retired before having been\nappointed in a substantive capacity, the benefits under these rules shall be\npayable to the government servant to the extent provided in the Central\nCivil Services (Temporary Service)\n Service Rules, 1965. Thus applicant\n cant entitled to\nbenefis as admissible to any other public servant and respondents have\nviolated fundamental right enshrined in \nArticle 14\n and \n21\n of Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n32. The G.I.D (5) Benefits to casual labourers on completion of three\nyears service in temporary status sub clause (3) of clause 2 of para 5 dated\n30.11.1992 provides for entitlement to temporary employee to pension and\nretirement benefits on his completion of three years service in temporary\nstatus followed by regularization.\n\n33. The applicant\n licant stood retired on 30.6.2018 as temporary employee for\nno fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge his duties\nand no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965 read with\nRules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of pension,,\nfamily pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee. The status\nof deceased employee was at par with regular employee on long\ncontinuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory\nRules 1965 read with Pension\n Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy\ndecision.\n\n34. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021 makes\nit clear that applicant who stood retired before having been appointed in a\nsubstantive capacity as regular cadre employee for such ty\n type\n pe of category of\ntemporary employee benefit\n benefit of pension Rules ii,.e\n ,.e Pension, retirement\n\n 21 OA 1109/2019\n\ngratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to applicant\nsame scale as admissible to permanent servant under CCS Pension Rules to\nthe extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under ::-\n\n (i) On retirement from service on superannuation or invalidation after\n having rendered continuous temporary/quasi permanent service of\n not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary retirement after completion of 20 years of\n continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n35. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory schemes\nclarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS Pension Rules\n ules\n2021 (erstwhile\n (ers Rules 2017) . This Tribunal considered the matter and in\nview of whereof of the affirm view that Government of India, Department\nof Posts instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-9/91-SPB-II\ndated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are social\nlegislation when read conjointly and harmoniously\n harmoniously.. The Rules 1965 and\nthe Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status in\ndepartment of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly\nacquired temporary status\n status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and\npensioner benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement\npensionery\nRule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 is failure of social\njustice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is\nsubstantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state as an ideal\nemployer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in\nPart IV of the Constitution.\n\n Constitution\n\n36. A Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supre\n Supreme Court in case\n ase of\nSecretary, State of Karnataka & ors vs Uma Devi and others (2006) 4\nSCC 1 in para 44 of said judgement dated 10.4.2006 had directed that the\nUnion of India and state government and their instrumentalities should take\nsteps to regularize as one time measure\n measure. The\n he services of irregularly\nappointed who are duly qualified persons in terms of rules and worked for\nten years or more. The contention of respondents is that in view of law laid\ndown in case of Uma Devi (supra) applicant casual labour continued for\nlong period can not claim to be made permanent is contrary to direction of\nHon'ble Supreme Court in para 44 as one time measure to consider for\nregularization . The respondents have not discharged their duties as model\nemployer and did not even consider\n er applicant in light of policy for\nregularization as one time measure, framed pursuant to directions in case of\n\n 22 OA 1109/2019\n\nUma Devi (supra).\n\n (supra) Hence the contention of respondents so far related to\napplicant being merely casual labour acquired temporary status and worked\n ed\nfor long duration can not claim permanent post substantive appointment not\nregularized deserves to be rejected.\n\n \nThus respondents can not take advantages of their own wrong and\nlapses and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and applicant\nentitled\n titled to receive pension as if retired from regular establishment and so\nalso held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgement in case of\n\nPrem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC 516 reproduced\nherein above.\n\n37. The contention of the respondents\n dents that Hon'ble High Court, Patna in\ncase of \nUnion of India versus Bhikhani Devi CWJC No.\n 154 of 2019\ndecided on 14.10.2019, their Lordships had set-asie\n asie order dated 27.3.2018\npassed in O.A. No. 372/2017 (\nBhikhani Devi Vs Union of India\n) as\nTribunal\n ribunal relied on ratio in CWJC No. 11435/2017 and 10978/2017 and SLP\ndismissed against same.\n \nTheir Lordships in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra)\nobserved that judgements relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017 and\n10978/2017 and none of them considered the im\n impact\n pact of Circular dated\n15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that there is no automatic appointment from\ntemporary status\n status to regular Group 'D' unless abso\n absorbed\n ed as per rules. So also\nTribunal not adjudicated points unless an employee is in regular service in\ncadre, pensionary\n pensionary benefits would not be admissible.\n\n \nThe learned counsel\n sel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that the\nDivision Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal\nissue dealt in detail rules applicable in case of \nUnion of India and ors\nversus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n 7760 of 2015 decided\non 08.12.2022,\n 2, reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated\n20.3.2013\n .3.2013 in similar OA No. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of\nfamily pension arrears as per Rule 10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CC\n CCS\n S Pension\nRules 1972 widow of employee died as temporary employee without being\nregularized.\n \nThis Tribunal has considered the submissions of the counsel\nfor the parties and in judgement in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) previous\ncases not referred to the larger\n la bench perused the ratio \nlaid down by\n their\nLordships in case of \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) decided on\n08.12.2022. Their Lordships considering scheme for Casual Labourers\n\n 23 OA 1109/2019\n\n(Grant of Temporary Status and Regularization) and held that husband of\nthe applicant being temporary employee governed by CCS TS Rules 1965\nand as per Rule 10 of CCSTS Rule 1965 read with CCS Pension Rule\nTheir Lordships in Para 10 of judgement directed reads as under :-\n\n \" 10.

After considering the\nproposition of law precedent/ratio decidendi has been laid down.. This\nTribunal is bound by the precedent in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n\n(supra) principle of law laid down interpreting service rules applicable in\nthe case.\n\n \ncas The present\n ent case is also squarely covered by the above binding--\nratio decedendi,\n decedendi precedent. The preposition of law as laid down\nconsidering relevant service rules in \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n\n(supra) by Hon'ble High Court Patna constitutes binding precedent on this\nTribunal and present case is also squarely covered deserves same\ntreatment.\n\n38. This Tribunal also examined cases precedents in similar and\nidentical situations and In \nJagriti Mazdoor Union\n (supra) Hon'ble\nSupreme Court considering the scheme fo\n forr casual labourers (Grant of\nTemporary Status and Regularisation) Scheme directed the department of\nposts that on rendering three years of continuous service with temporary\nstatus. The\n he Casual labouers shall be treated at par with temporary Grade 'D'\nemployee and entitled to such benefits as are admissible to Group 'D'\nemployee\nemployees on regular basis.\n\n39. In Yashwant Hari Katakkar (supra) Hon'ble Supreme Court held\nthat there is nothing on record to show as to why the applicant was not\nmade permanent even when he had served the government for 18 ½ years.\nIt would be travesty of justice if applicant is denied the pensionary benefits\n\n 24 OA 1109/2019\n\nsimply on the ground that he was not regularized not a permanent employee\nof the government. Keeping in view facts and circumstances appellant was\ndeemed to have become permanent after he served the government for such\na long period. The services shall be treated to be permanent capacity and\nshall be entitled to the pensionary benefits.\n\n40. \nIn \nKritnarain Singh\n (Supra), \nSmt Ram Kali Devi\n (supra), \nMeena\nDevi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra), Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court\nPatna examined core issue involved in present OA and their Lordships\nupheld the orders passed by this Tribunal in same facts and law and\nobserved that failure on part of postal department respondents not to\nregularize services of employees serving for long period can not be\nappreciated and directed respondents\n respondents to extend benefits of pension, family\npension etc. So also upheld orders of this Tribunal in identical cases.\n\n41.

In view whereof reading of sub- clause (3) of clause 2 of Para 5 of\nthe Scheme,\n cheme, dated 30.11.1992 reproduced herein above relating to benefit\nto casual labourers on completion of three years service in temporary status\nof Casual Labourers (Grant of temporary status and regularization) Scheme\n\n 26 OA 1109/2019\n\nis crystal clear that temporary emplo\n employee\n yee is entitled to pension and\nretirement benefits, if he has completed three years of service in temporary\nstatus followed by regularization, The husband of applicant granted\ntemporary status w.e.f. 1.8.2000 and not been regularized by respondents\ninspite of requests and for no fault stood retired on 30.6.2018 and died on\n28.5.202\n28.5.2022.\n\n The condition of services of the Temporary Government servants are\nregulated by the Central Civil Services (Temporary Services) Rules 1965.\nAs per Rule 10 of Rules 1965, legal right accrued for grant of pension,\nretirement gratuity and in the event\n even of death after retirement, members of\nhis family shall be eligible for the grant of family pension read with the\nprovisions of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 2021 (Erstwhile Rules\n1972)..
