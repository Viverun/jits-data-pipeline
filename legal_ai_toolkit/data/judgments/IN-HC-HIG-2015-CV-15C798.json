The question referred though is confined only to the\n\naspect as to whether an order passed by quasi-judicial\n\nauthority of conferring certain service benefits under 1972 Act\n\ncould be retrospectively taken away. In other words, whether\n\nsuch a quasi-judicial pronouncement tantamount to accrual of\n\nright in favour of such employees or class of employees and the\n\nright so accrued can be taken away by effecting an exemption\n\nfrom 1972 Act from retrospective date. And, whether the choice\n\nof date can be beyond the date from which the corporate entity\n\nhas come into existence.\n\n13. The answer could have been short had the question\n\nreferred was the only issue, the reason being that, though all\n\nthese five corporate entities were reconstituted and\n\nrestructured with effect from 1.6.2005 yet, in TRANSCO, the\n\nexemption has been made effective from 16.9.1972 i.e. from\n\nthe date when Act of 1972 came into existence. Whether this\n\ncould be done was the only issue. But, it is not to be so\n\nbecause alongwith these batch of Writ Petitions is also a Writ\n:: 17 ::\n\nW.P.

Therefore, we intend to\n\ndeal with the issue of vires also by this order.\n\n14. We straightaway go to the aspect of vires.\n\n15. The contentions on behalf of petitioners to the validity of\n\nnotification is that it is beyond the powers of the appropriate\n\nGovernment to review the notification earlier issued and make\n\nit effective from retrospective date and grant exemption from a\n\nretrospective effect thereby taking away the right of gratuity\n\naccrued under 1972 Act and thereby, creating a class within a\n\nclass. And that subjecting the class to be exempted to the\n\nprovisions less favourable than the benefits conferred under\n\n1972 Act. It is also the contention that the right accrued in\n\nfavour of the employees has been taken away from a\n\nretrospective date without affording an opportunity of hearing.\n\nIn substantiation of these submissions, learned counsel for the\n\nemployees have led us through the benefit towards gratuity\n\ncomputed as per\nSection 4\nof 1972 Act being more beneficial\n\nthan the gratuity payable under the Pension Rules 1976.\n\nFormula provided under the Act of 1972 and one under 1976\n\nRules for computation of gratuity has been commended at to\n:: 18 ::\n\nW.P.

Thus, if sub-section (1) and (2) of\nSection 5\nempowers\n\nthe appropriate Government to exempt any establishment,\n\nfactory, mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway company or\n\nshop; any employee or class of employees employed in these\n\nestablishment(s) from the operation of provisions of Act of\n\n1972; sub-section (3) of\nSection 5\ngrafts in appropriate\n\nGovernment to issue such notification even from a retrospective\n\ndate. Apparently, the powers conferred to the appropriate\n\nGovernment is not only to issue notification for exemption but\n\nalso to issue the same from retrospective date. Thus, two\n\nindependent powers are conferred in the appropriate\n\nGovernment. True it may be that the exercise of power under\n\nSection (3) of\nSection 5\nmay be exerciseable with the issuance\n\nof notification under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 5\n, but it delegates powers independent to these powers\n\nby making exemption effective from retrospective date.

In other words, the powers to make the notification\n\neffective from a retrospective date does not get exhausted\n\nmerely because it does not find mention in a notification issued\n\nunder sub-section (1) or (2) of\nSection 5\n, as the case may be.\n\nThus, to exempt the establishment or the employee or class of\n\nemployees from retrospective date not earlier than the date of\n\ncommencement of Act of 1972 conferred upon the appropriate\n\nGovernment is supplementary to and additional constituent of\n\npower of exemption as conferred under sub-section (1) and (2)\n\nof\nSection 5\n. Thus, there is no transgression of the powers\n\nconferred in the appropriate Government who, at one point of\n\ntime, issue an exemption notification by making it effective\n\nfrom the date of issuance of notification and at another point of\n\ntime, issue notification by making the exemption from the date\n\nprior to issuance of exemption notification.\n\n20.

Coming to the case at hand, it is not being disputed that,\n\nfinding the provisions of Act of 1972 more beneficial than the\n\nexisting gratuity provisions contained in 1976 Rules, the\n\nControlling Authority has been allowing the claim and directing\n\nfor computation of gratuity in consonance with\nSection 4\nof\n\n1972 Act. That being so, there is accrual of right in the\n\nemployees/existing pensioners who have been held entitled for\n\nthe gratuity under 1972 Act as could be taken away from the\n\nretrospective date.\n\n26. This issue can be analysed from another angle. The\n\nimpugned notification exempting the corporate entities from\n\nretrospective effect has been issued on the bedrock that the\n\nprovisions of 1976 Rules were made applicable to erstwhile\n\nMadhya Pradesh State Electricity Board and the gratuity and\n\npension component were more beneficial than the gratuity\n\nunder 1972 Act. However, as noticed above, the aspect as to\n\nwhether the gratuity under 1976 Rules are more beneficial than\n\nunder 1972 Act has been the subject matter of scrutiny before\n\nthe Controlling Authority and the Appellate Authority in\n\numpteen number of cases in past where on adjudication it has\n:: 28 ::\n\nW.P.

To justify the exemption from retrospective date, it is\n\ncontended on behalf of respondents that under the Act of 1972,\n\nthe employees are entitled only of gratuity whereas under the\n\nRules of 1976 they, besides gratuity, are entitled for the pension\n\nwhich is paid lifelong. Taking an employee's service span of 35\n\nyears, it is urged that under the Act of 1972, a Class IV\n\nemployee gets one time gratuity of Rs.4,39,288/- and if divided\n\nin terms of future benefits he gets Rs.3,122/- per month.\n\nSimilar breakup has been given in respect of Class III and Class\n\nII employees. As evident, comparison has been drawn in case\n\nof an employee governed by Rules, 1976.\n\n29.

The judgment in Janak Prasad proceeded with the facts\n\nas borne out from paragraphs 16, 17, and 18 that in Bihar\n\nElectricity Board Workmen were earlier paid gratuity in terms of\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nand it was on account of persistent\n\ndemand raised through the representatives employees Union\n\nthat the Board ultimately agreed to pay monthly pension by\n\nadopting Bihar Pension Rules which was a package for payment\n\nof gratuity to the employees (under Rule 27 of the Pension\n\nRules pension includes gratuity). The Court thus found that the\n\npension package available under the Bihar Pension Rules\n\nprovides a better support system to the retired officer/\n\nemployees and their dependents unlike the benefits conferred\n\nby the gratuity Act.\nIn the case of\nVishwanath\n(supra), the\n:: 32 ::\n\nW.P.

Union of India\n[(1990)\n4 SCC 314] in which it had been held that gratuity\nwas not a part of pension, was not followed, as the\nBench which decided that case had not been referred\nto the aforesaid definition of pension.\nSimilar\nobservation was made in Jarnail Singh case'\nregarding F.R. Jesuratnam v. Union of India [1990\nSupp SCC 640] wherein also gratuity was not\nregarded as part of pension without noting the\nabovenoted definition.\n\n14. To buttress his aforesaid submission, Shri Jain\nalso refers to clause (17) of\nArticle 366\nof the\nConstitution which has defined pension to include\ngratuity. Merely because what has been stated in\nclause (17) it cannot be held that gratuity has to be\ntaken always and for all purposes as part of pension,\nbecause this definition apparently has enlarged the\nmeaning of the word \"pension\" by stating that this\nwould include gratuity. It is well known that\nlegislature very often wants to give enlarged meaning\n:: 36 ::\n\nW.P.

We, therefore, state that either because of\nwhat was stated in\nJarnail Singh\ncase or the way\n\"pension\" has been defined in the Constitution, it\ncannot be held that pension and gratuity are\nconceptually same, as stated in paragraph 9 of\nJarnail\nSingh\ncase' to which our attention is invited by Shri\nJain. According to us, this Court took the view in\nquestion in Jarnail Singh because of the definition of\nthe word \"pension\" in the concerned rule; otherwise,\nwhat was held in D. V. Kapoor and F.R.

No.17407/15\n\nis not possible for us to hold that the respondent is\nnot entitled to the gratuity under the\nPayment of\nGratuity Act\n. The only provision which was pointed\nout is the definition of \"employee\" in\nSection 2 (e)\n\nwhich excludes the employees of the Central\nGovernment and State Governments receiving\npension and gratuity under the Pension Rules but\nnot an employee of the MCD. The MCD employee,\ntherefore, would be entitled to the payment of\ngratuity under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. The\nmere fact that the gratuity is provided for under the\nPension Rules will not disentitle him to get the\npayment of gratuity under the\nPayment of Gratuity\nAct\n. In view of the overriding provisions contained\nin\nSection 14\nof the Payment of Gratuity Act, the\nprovision for gratuity under the Pension Rules will\nhave no effect. Possibly for this reason,\nSection 5\nof\nthe Payment of Gratuity Act has conferred authority\non the appropriate Government to exempt any\nestablishment from the operation of the provisions\nof the Act, if in its opinion the employees of such\nestablishment are in receipt of gratuity or\npensionary benefits not less favourable than the\nbenefits conferred under this Act. Admittedly MCD\nhas not taken any steps to invoke the power of the\nCentral Government under Sectopm 5 of the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n. In the aforesaid premises,\nwe are of the considered opinion that the\nemployees of the MCD would be entitled to the\npayment of gratuity under the\nPayment of Gratuity\nAct\nnotwithstanding the fact that the provisions of\nthe Pension Rules have been made applicable to\nthem for the purpose of determining the pension.\n\nNeedless to mention that the employees cannot\nclaim gratuity available under the Pension Rules. .\"\n\n39.

And since by\n\nvirtue of\nSection 14\nof 1972 Act the provisions therein have an\n\noverriding effect, the accrual of right to receive gratuity under\n\n1972 Act cannot be taken away from the existing pensioners\n\neven if it is within the powers of the appropriate government to\n\ncause exemption from a retrospective date.\n\n40. The next issue for consideration is that whether the\n\nimpugned notification takes away the vested right said to have\n\naccrued in favour of existing pensioners. In order words,\n\nwhether the retrospective operation would have an adverse\n\neffect over the right of existing pensioners for a gratuity under\n\nthe Act of 1972.\n\n41.

The legislature is undoubtedly competent to\nlegislate with retrospective effect to take away or\nimpair any vested right acquired under existing\nlaws but since the laws are made under a written\nConstitution, and have to conform to the dos and\ndon'ts of the Constitution; neither prospective nor\nretrospective laws can be made so as to contravene\nFundamental Rights. The law must satisfy the\nrequirements of the Constitution today taking into\naccount the accused or acquired rights of the\nparties today. The law cannot say twenty years ago\nthe parties had no rights, therefore, the\nrequirements of the Constitution will be satisfied if\nthe law is dated back by twenty years. We are\nconcerned with today's rights and not yesterday's.\n\nA Legislature cannot legislate today with reference\nto a situation that obtained twenty years ago and\nignore the march of events and the constitutional\nrights accrued in the course of the twenty years.\n\nThat would be most arbitrary, unreasonable and a\nnegation of history.\"\n\n:: 40 ::\n\nW.P.
