It is not in dispute that services of the petitioners and\nprivate respondents are governed by M.P. Veterinary Services\n(Gazetted) Recruitment Rules, 1966 and that the promotions\nare governed by the Rules framed under proviso to\nArticle 309\n\nread with\nArticle 16\nand\nof the Constitution of India,\nknown as Madhya Pradesh Public Services (Promotion) Rules,\n2002 (for brevity 'Rules of 2002') and as per Rule 4 read with\nRule 6 thereof, the promotion from the post of Assistant\nVeterinary Surgeon (substantive post) to that of Deputy\nDirector/Civil Surgeon (Veterinary Services), Animal Breeding\nProgramme Officer, a Class I post is on the basis of \"seniority\nsubject to fitness\".\n\n3. That, Departmental Promotion Committee convened its\nmeeting on 13.9.2012 to consider Assistant Veterinary Surgeon\nas on 1.4.2011 for the following vacancies -\n\nCategory Actual Anticipated\nVacancies Vacancies\n:: 3 ::\n\nGeneral Category - 119 112 7\n\nScheduled Caste - 26 22 4\n\nScheduled Tribes - 35 35 NIL\n\n4.

That, on the basis of these criteria, the Departmental\nPromotion Committee enlisted 129 Assistant Veterinary\nSurgeon from Serial No.4 to 524 in the Gradation List within\nthe zone of consideration.\n\n6. Evidently, others like the petitioners, though senior, are\n:: 5 ::\n\ndeclared ineligible as they are not found fulfilling the criteria\n7(3), accordingly, superseded.\n\n7. The procedure adopted by the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee in shortlisting only such Assistant Veterinary\nSurgeons/Senior Veterinary Surgeon, having A+ and A, ACR's is\nbeing questioned on the ground that the DPC by introducing\nthe element of comparative assessment of merits has violated\nthe norms of selection provided under Rule 4 read with Rule\n6(7) of Rules of 2002. It is contended that since these Rules\nenvisage that promotion from Class II to Class I posts is on the\nbasis of seniority subject to fitness with rider contained in sub-\n\nrule (7) of Rule 6, the promotion of juniors on the basis of\ncriteria laid down vide 7(3) deserves to be set aside.\n\n8. State of Madhya Pradesh and its functionaries, on their\nturn, however justify the criteria laid down by the DPC as\nincumbents and eligible persons were found more in number\nthan the posts. It is contended that it is within the right of the\nDPC to have fixed minimum criteria to adjudge the merit even\nwhere the promotion is based on seniority subject to suitability.\n\n9. Private respondents while adopting the stand taken by\nthe State Government, raises an objection as to maintainability\nof the petitions as all the promotees are not impleaded. It is\nfurther contended that since the petitioners were not having\nA+ and A to their credit and juniors like respondents were\nfulfilling the criteria, petitioners' supersession cannot be faulted\nwith. It is urged that the DPC being the best judge to ascertain\n:: 6 ::\n\nthe criteria for promotion and the promotion being not a right,\nno relief can be granted to the petitioners.\n\n10. Considered the rival submissions.\n\n11. As regard to the contention that all the promotees being\nnecessary parties, having not been impleaded, the petition\ncannot be entertained. It is observed that immediate juniors\nare impleaded as respondents in each of the petitions. It has\nbeen held in\nV.P. Shrivastava v. State of M.P\n(1996) 7 SCC 759\nthat -\n\n\"14. The conclusion of the Tribunal that non\ninclusion of the affected parties is fatal to the\nappellants case is also unsustainable in law. It is to\nbe stated that the appellants do not challenge the\nso called ad-hoc appointments of the promotee\nrespondents but they do challenge the position of\nthe said ad-hoc promotee respondents over the\nappellants in the seniority list. In other words the\nvery principle of 'determination of seniority' made\nby the State Government is under challenge and\nfor such a case State is the necessary party who\nhas been impleaded. It has been held by this Court\nin the case of G.M. South Central Rly. v A.V.R.\nSiddhanti (1974) SCC 335 -\n\n\"As regards the second objection, it is to be\nnoted that the decision of the Railway Board\nimpugned in the writ petition contain\nadministrative rules of general application,\nregulating absorption in permanent departments,\nfixation of seniority, pay etc. of the employees of\nthe erstwhile Grain Shop departments. The\nRespondents-petitioners are impeaching the\nvalidity of those policy decisions on the ground\nof their being violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution. The proceedings are analogous\nto those in which the constitutionality of a\n:: 7 ::\n\nstatutory rule regulating seniority of government\nservants is assailed. In such proceedings the\nnecessary parties to be impleaded are those\nagainst whom the relief is sought, and in whose\nabsence no effective decision can be rendered by\nthe Court. In the present case, the relief is\nclaimed only against the Railway which has been\nimpleaded through its representative. No list or\norder fixing seniority of the petitioners vis-a-vis\nparticular individuals pursuant to the impugned\ndecisions, is being challenged. The employees\nwho were likely to be affected as a result of the\nre-adjustment of the petitioner's seniority in\naccordance with the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\nBoard's decision of October 16, 1952 were, at\nthe most, proper parties and not necessary\nparties, and their non-joinder could not be fatal\nto the writ petition.\"\n\n...\n\n16. Further in view of finding of the Tribunal that\nrespondents 3 and 4 successfully safeguarded the\ninterest of the promotees. The Tribunal erred in\nlaw in holding that non-inclusion of the affected\nparties is fatal to the proceeding. It has been held\nby this Court in the case of\nPrabodh Verma v State\nof U.P.\n(1984) 4 SCC 251 that -\n\n\"A High Court ought not to hear and dispose of a\nwrit petition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\nwithout the persons who would be vitally\naffected by its judgment being before it as\nrespondents or at least some of them being\nbefore it as respondents in a representative\ncapacity if their number is too large to join them\nas respondents individually.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n12.\nIn view of the principle of law\nlaid down in\n\nV.P.\nShrivastava\n(supra) and the fact that immediate juniors who\nare promoted are impleaded as respondents in each of these\n:: 8 ::\n\npetitions, the objection as to maintainability of the petitions for\nnon-impleading all the promotees is overruled.\n\n13. As regard to contention that it is within the jurisdiction of\nthe Departmental Promotion Committee to lay down the\ncriteria, there can be no doubt as to proposition that suitability\nfor promotion must be left to be decided by the DPC, but\nequally settled it is that the DPC must determine suitability\naccording to the applicable rules (Please see :\nUnion of India v.\nSangram Keshari Nayak\n(2007) 6 SCC 704 wherein it is held -\n\n\"11. Promotion is not a fundamental right. Right\nto be considered for promotion, however, is a\nfundamental right. Such a right brings within its\npurview an effective, purposeful and meaningful\nconsideration. Suitability or otherwise of the\ncandidate concerned, however, must be left at the\nhands of the DPC, but the same has to be\ndetermined in terms of the rules applicable\ntherefor. ..\"\n\n14. It is also settled principle of law that when Rule provides\nfor the criteria to be adhered to and the procedure to be\nfollowed, then it is incumbent that the exercise of power must\nbe only in the mode provided by the statute (Please see :\n\nHukam Chand Shyam Lal v. Union of India\nAIR 1976 SC 789,\nwherein it is held that \"where a power is required to be\nexercised by a certain authority in a certain way, it should be\nexercised in that manner or not at all, and all other modes of\nperformance are necessarily forbidden\".\n\nFurther, in\n\nMarathwada University v. Seshrao Balwant Rao Chavan\nAIR\n1989 SC 582, wherein it is held -\n\n26. These principles of ratification, apparently do\n:: 9 ::\n\nnot have any application with regard to exercise of\npowers conferred under statutory provisions. The\nstatutory authority cannot travel beyond the power\nconferred and any action without power has no\nlegal validity. It is ab initio void and cannot be\nratified.\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n15. In the case at hand, evidently and undisputedly, the\nprocedure prescribed under Rule 4 & 6 of Rules of 2002 are\napplicable for promotion from Class II to Class I posts. Rule 4\nstipulates -\n\n\"4. Determination of basis for promotion.- (1)\nPromotion from class IV to higher pay scale of class\nIV, class IV to class III, class III to higher pay scale\nof class III, class III to class II, class II to higher\npay scale of class II and class II to class I posts\nshall be made on the basis of \"seniority subject to\nfitness\".\n\n(2) Promotion from class I to higher pay scale of\nclass I posts shall be made on the basis of \"merit-\ncum-seniority\".\n\nProvided that the Promotion from the post of sub-\nEngineer to Assistant Engineer in the Departments\nof Public Works, Water Resources, Public Health\nEngineering and also Panchayat and Rural\nDevelopment shall be made on the basis of \"merit-\ncum-seniority.\"\n\n16. Whereas, Rule 6 lays down the procedure to be followed\nin case of promotion. Sub-rule (1), (4), (5), (6) and (7), which\nare relevant in the context, are extracted below -\n\n\"6. Promotion on the basis of seniority subject\nto fitness.-\n\n(1) In such cases where the promotion is to be\nmade on the basis of seniority subject to fitness,\nthere shall be no zone of consideration for all\n:: 10 ::\n\ncategories.\n\n...\n\n(4) The meeting of the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee shall be held every year. It shall\nconsider the suitability of the public servants for\npromotion separately with reference to the\nvacancies of each year starting with the earliest\nyear onwards. The Departmental Promotion\nCommittee shall consider the suitability of the\npublic servants for promotion to fill up the unfilled\nvacancies of the earlier year or years separately\nand prepare the select list for the relevant year\naccordingly. Thereafter the Departmental\nPromotion Committee shall consider the suitability\nof the public servants for promotion to fill up the\nexisting and anticipated vacancies of the current\nyear.\n\n(5) The Departmental Promotion Committee shall\nassess the suitability of the public servants for\npromotion on the basis of their service record and\nwith particular reference to the Annual Confidential\nReports (ACRs) for 5 preceding years. However, in\ncases where the required qualifying service is more\nthan 5 years, the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee shall see the record with particular\nreference to the ACRs for the years equal to the\nrequired qualifying service.\n\n(6) When one or more ACRs are not available for\nany reason for the relevant period, the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee shall consider\nthe ACRs of the years preceding the period in\nquestion.\n\n(7) For filling up the posts by this method, the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee shall consider\nthe case of each public servants separately on the\nbasis of his own merit , that is to say, that there\nshall be no need to make a comparative\nassessment of the merits of public servant. The\nDepartmental Promotion Committee shall consider\nthe records of each public servant separately and\n:: 11 ::\n\nshall categorize them as 'fit' or 'not fit'.\"\n\n17. Thus, clear it is from these rules that in case of\npromotion from Class II to Class I post as, in the present case,\nthe same is on the basis of 'seniority subject to suitability' and\nthat there shall be no zone of consideration. And, that the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee shall assess the suitability\nof the public servants from promotion on the basis of their\nservice record and with particular reference to the Annual\nConfidential Reports (ACRs) for five preceding years. And, that\nthe filling up the posts by the method under Rule 6, the DPC\nshall consider the case of each public servants separately on\nthe basis of his own merit that there shall be no need to make\na comparative assessment of the merits of public servant.\n\n18. Another Rule which needs mention at this stage to\nunderstand the difference in procedure to be followed in case\nof promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability and merit-\ncum-seniority is sub-rule (9) of Rule 7, which lays down the\nprocedure to be adhered to in case of promotion on merit-cum-\nsuitability. It stipulates -\n\n7. Promotion on the basis of merit-cum-\nseniority.\n\n...\n\n(9) The Departmental Promotion/Screening\nCommittee shall make a relative/comparative\nassessment of the merits of public servants who\nare within the zone of consideration and make an\noverall grading of the public servants merit on the\nbasis of their service records and place them in the\ncategories as \"Outstanding\", \"Very-Good\", \"Good\",\n\"Average\" and \"Poor\" as the case may be.\n\n:: 12 ::\n\nHowever, only those public servants who are\ngraded as \"Very-Good\" an above will be included in\nthe select list, by placing the public servants graded\nas \"Outstanding\" on top followed by those graded\nas \"Very-Good\", subject to availability of vacancies,\nwith the public servants with the same grading\nmaintaining their inter-se-seniority in the feeder\ncadre/part of the service/pay scales of post.\n\n19. Thus, when compared with, the procedure laid down\nunder Rule 7(9) aims at elimination by comparative assessment\nwhereas, Rule 6(7) aims at inclusion of seniors without taking\nrecourse to comparative assessment by adjudging their\nsuitability.\n\n20. What then would \"seniority subject to suitability\" mean ?\n\n21. Observing that in the matter of formulation of a policy for\npromotion to a higher post, the two competing principles which\nare taken into account are inter-se seniority and comparative\nmerit of employees who are eligible for promotion, their\nLordships in\nB.V. Sivaiah v. K. Addanki Babu\n(1998) 6 SCC 720\nwere pleased to hold -\n\n18. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the\ncriterion of 'seniority-cum-merit' in the matter of\npromotion postulates that given the minimum\nnecessary merit requisite for efficiency of\nadministration the senior, even though less\nmeritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\nassessment of merit is not required to be made.\n\nFor assessing the minimum necessary merit the\ncompetent authority can lay down the minimum\nstandard that is required and also prescribe the\nmode of assessment of merit of the employee who\nis eligible for consideration for promotion. Such\nassessment can be made by assigning marks on\n:: 13 ::\n\nthe basis of appraisal of performance on the basis\nof service record and interview and prescribing the\nminimum marks which would entitle a person to\nbe promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n22. Following decisions can also be taken note of on the\naspect of promotion based on seniority-cum-merit.\n\n(i) In\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava v. Samyut Kshetriya\nGramin Bank\nAIR 2010 SC 699, it is held -\n\n10. Thus it is clear that a process whereby\neligible candidates possessing the minimum\nnecessary merit in the feeder posts is first\nascertained and thereafter, promotions are made\nstrictly in accordance with seniority, from among\nthose who possess the minimum necessary merit is\nrecognised and accepted as complying with the\nprinciple of 'seniority-cum-merit'. What would\noffend the rule of seniority-cum-merit is a process\nwhere after assessing the minimum necessary\nmerit, promotions are made on the basis of merit\n(instead of seniority) from among the candidates\npossessing the minimum necessary merit. If the\ncriteria adopted for assessment of minimum\nnecessary merit is bona fide and not unreasonable,\nit is not open to challenge, as being opposed to the\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit. We accordingly\nhold that prescribing minimum qualifying marks to\nascertain the minimum merit necessary for\ndischarging the functions of the higher post, is not\nviolative of the concept of promotion by seniority-\ncum-merit.\n\n(ii) In\nRupa Rani Rakshit v. Jharkhand Gramin Bank\n\nAIR 2010 SC 787, it is held -\n\n\"7. ... On the other hand, the Bank proceeded to\nassess their inter-se-merit with reference to four\ncriteria (period of service, educational qualification,\nperformance during three years, and interview) by\nallocating respectively maximum marks of 40, 6, 24\nand 30 (out of a total 100 marks) and then\n:: 14 ::\n\nproceeded to promote those who had secured the\nhighest marks in the order of merit. Thus there\nwere two violations of the relevant rules : (i)\npromoting candidates on merit-cum-seniority and\nnot on seniority-cum-merit; and (ii) assessing inter-\nse merit, inter alia with reference to marks\nallocated to different educational qualifications. It\ncannot, therefore, be said that the promotions\nmade on 20.11.1990 were on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit. Though the period of service was also\nconsidered as one of the factors for assessment of\ncomparative merit, the procedure adopted for\npromotion was merit-cum-seniority. The High Court\nwas, therefore, justified in interfering with the\npromotions. The directions given by the High Court\nfor fresh process of promotion were in consonance\nwith the Rules and principles of seniority-cum-\nmerit. The appeals, therefore, have no merit.\n...\n\n10. .... Whenever a person is promoted to a post\nwithout following the rules prescribed for such\npromotion, he should be treated as a person not\nregularly promoted to that post. Consequently,\nwhere promotions are governed by Rules, in\ncomputing the length of service, in the post to\nwhich an employee is promoted, it is not\npermissible to include the period of service\nrendered in pursuance of an illegal promotion\nwhich is subsequently set aside.\"\n\n23. Thus, when promotion is on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit, there is greater emphasis upon seniority even though\nthe same is not the deciding factor.\nIn\nBalbir Singh Bedi v.\nState of Punjab\n, (2013) 11 SCC 746, it is held -\n\n\"15. In view of the above, the law as regards this\npoint can be summarised to the effect that, where\na promotion is to be given on the principle of\n\"seniority-cum-merit\", such promotion will not\nautomatically be granted on the basis of seniority\n:: 15 ::\n\nalone. Efficiency of administration cannot be\ncompromised with at any cost. Thus, in order to\nmeet said requirements, all eligible candidates in\nthe feeder cadre must be subject to a process of\nassessment to determine whether or not an\nindividual in fact possesses the specified minimum\nnecessary merit, and in the event that he does\npossess the same, his case must be considered\ngiving due weightage to his seniority. Furthermore,\nthe statutory authority must adopt a bonafide and\nreasonable method to determine the minimum\nnecessary merit, as is required to be possessed by\nthe eligible candidate.\"\n\n24.\nIn the context, reference can also be had of the decision\nin\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava v. Samyut Kshetriya\n(2010) 1\nSCC 335 wherein their Lordships were pleased to hold -\n\n\"11. It is also well settled that the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit, for promotion, is different\nfrom the principle of 'seniority' and principle of\n'merit-cum-seniority'. Where promotion is on the\nbasis of seniority alone, merit will not play any part\nat all. But where promotion is on the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit, promotion is not automatic\nwith reference to seniority alone. Merit will also\nplay a significant role. The standard method of\nseniority-cum-merit is to subject all the eligible\ncandidates in the feeder grade (possessing the\nprescribed educational qualification and period of\nservice) to a process of assessment of a specified\nminimum necessary merit and then promote the\ncandidates who are found to possess the minimum\nnecessary merit strictly in the order of seniority.\nThe minimum merit necessary for the post may be\nassessed either by subjecting the candidates to a\nwritten examination or an interview or by\nassessment of their work performance during the\nprevious years, or by a combination of either two\nor all the three of the aforesaid methods. There is\n:: 16 ::\n\nno hard and fast rule as to how the minimum merit\nis to be ascertained. So long as the ultimate\npromotions are based on seniority, any process for\nascertaining the minimum necessary merit, as a\nbasic requirement, will not militate against the\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n..\n\n13. Thus it is clear that a process whereby\neligible candidates possessing the minimum\nnecessary merit in the feeder posts is first\nascertained and thereafter, promotions are made\nstrictly in accordance with seniority, from among\nthose who possess the minimum necessary merit is\nrecognised and accepted as complying with the\nprinciple of 'seniority-cum-merit'. What would\noffend the rule of seniority-cum-merit is a process\nwhere after assessing the minimum necessary\nmerit, promotions are made on the basis of merit\n(instead of seniority) from among the candidates\npossessing the minimum necessary merit. If the\ncriteria adopted for assessment of minimum\nnecessary merit is bona fide and not unreasonable,\nit is not open to challenge, as being opposed to the\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit. We accordingly\nhold that prescribing minimum qualifying marks to\nascertain the minimum merit necessary for\ndischarging the functions of the higher post, is not\nviolative of the concept of promotion by seniority-\n\ncum-merit.\"\n\n25. Keeping in mind the principle of law laid down as regard\nto promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-suitability/seniority-\ncum-merit, in the case at hand, the relevant rules adverted to\ni.e. Rule 4 and the procedure required to be adhered to as\nstipulated under Rule 6 of Rules of 2002, the fixing of bench\nmark A+ and A for adjudging the eligibility as observed earlier\nhas led to elimination of such seniors who does not have these\ngradings. Thus, an element of merit over seniority has been\n:: 17 ::\n\nintroduced by the DPC. This is further established by sub-\nclause (5) of Clause 7 of the criteria\nlaid down by\nDPC, which\nenvisages -\n\n¼5½ lfefr us inksUufr fu;e 2002 dh dafMdk 9 dh mi\ndafMdk 6 ds vuqlkj inksUufr lfefr }kjk fopkjk/khu vof/k\nds xksiuh; izfrosnuksa ds ewY;kaduksa ds vk/kkj ij vadksa dk\nfu/kkZj.k LohdkjdrkZ vf/kdkjh }kjk fd, x, ewY;kaduksa ds\nvk/kkj ij fd;k tkosxkA ;fn lfefr xksiuh; izfrosnu esa\nizfrosnd vf/kdkjh rFkk leh{kd vf/kdkjh }kjk fd, x,\newY;kadu ds vk/kkj ij Lohd`rdrkZ vf/kdkjh ds ewY;kadu ls\nlger ugha gS rks og blds fy, vius dkj.k fyfic) djrs\ngq, ewY;kadu djsxh ijUrq lfefr Lohd`rdrkZ vf/kdkjh }kjk\nfd, x, ewY;kadu ds vk/kkj ij izkIr vad esa dsoy ,d\nvad c<k ldsxh vFkok ?kVk ldsxhA dks Hkh /;ku esa j[kk\nx;kA\n\n- which is in consonance with the procedure laid down\nunder Rule 7(9) for promotion on merit-cum-suitability but is\nnot in conformation with Rule 6 of Rules of 2002. Rather, the\ncriteria laid down under sub-clause (3) and (5) of Clause 7 is\nantithesis to the basic rule of seniority subject to suitability as\nenvisaged under Rule 4 read with Rule 6 of Rules of 2002.\n\n26. Considered thus the procedure adhered to by the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee by laying down the criteria\nintroducing the element of merit having overriding effect on\nseniority cannot be given the stamp of approval and the non-\npromotion of seniors as compared to juniors on the basis of\nthese criteria deserves reconsideration on the basis of above\nanalysis by holding a review Departmental Promotion\nCommittee, wherein if seniors are adjudged suitable, the\njuniors who were promoted on the basis of criteria found to be\n:: 18 ::\n\ncontrary to Rule 4 and 6 of Rules of 2002 will have to give way.\nFor that, no separate notice need be issued to the juniors as\ntheir promotion were subject to final outcome.\n\n27. Let the action be taken within three months from the\ndate of communication of this order.\n\n28. Petitions are allowed to the extent above. However, there\nshall be no order as to costs.\n\n29. Let a copy of this common order be retained in connected\npetitions.\n\n(SANJAY YADAV)\nJUDGE\nvinod",
