Agrawal\n\nOrder On Board\n\n04/08/2021\n\n1. Proceedings of this matter have been taken-up through video\n\nconferencing.\n\n2. The petitioner in this writ petition seeks appropriate writ / direction\n\ncommanding / directing the official respondents to consider the case\n\nof the petitioner for the promotional post of Console Operator T&S\nGrade-A with effect from 4-9-2008 i.e. the date on which respondents\n\nNo.4 to 6 (juniors) were promoted on the post of Console Operator\n\nT&S Grade-A and also seeks all consequential benefits like seniority,\n\npay, etc., on the said post with effect from 4-9-2008.\n\n3. The petitioner has filed this writ petition stating inter alia that he was\n\ninitially selected in South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) on the\n\npost of General Mazdoor Category-I on 26-11-1986 and later-on, he\n\nwas promoted on the post of Junior Data Entry Operator T&S Grade-E\n\nand lastly, he was promoted as Junior Console Operator T&S Grade-B\n\non 30-8-2002 in accordance with the Cadre Scheme. It is the further\n\ncase of the petitioner that in the year 2008, vacancies arose for the\n\npost of Programmer Assistant / Console Operator T&S Grade-A and\n\nas per the Cadre Scheme, the petitioner and respondents No.4 to 6\n\nwere eligible and their cases have been considered as per the Cadre\n\nScheme vide Annexure P-5, page 23 of the writ petition, in the\n\nmeeting of Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) convened on\n\n21-7-2008 on the criteria applicable i.e. merit-cum-seniority and the\n\nsaid Committee adopted methodology, which provides that 60 marks\n\nwere kept for merit and 40 marks for seniority and 70 marks were\n\nfixed as cutoff marks for eligibility in promotion. It is also the case of\n\nthe petitioner that he secured 96 marks, whereas the private\n\nrespondents i.e. respondents No.4 to 6 have secured 90 marks each,\n\nbut the DPC recommended the names of 7 candidates including\n\nrespondents No.4 to 6 for promotion on the basis of seniority\n\nexcluding the petitioner and thereby adopted the criteria of seniority-\n\ncum-merit saying go-by to the applicable criteria of merit-cum-\n\nseniority, therefore, the petitioner is deprived of the promotional post\n\non 4-9-2008, though he was later-on promoted on 25-1-2011, but he is\nentitled to be considered and promoted on the post of Console\n\nOperator T&S Grade-A with effect from 4-9-2008 as his juniors -\n\nrespondents No.4 to 6 were promoted on the said date and is also\n\nentitled for the promotional benefits.\n\n4. Respondents No.1 to 3 / SECL have filed return principally stating that\n\nsince the petitioner has been promoted on the post of Console\n\nOperator T&S Grade-A with effect from 25-1-2011, therefore, the writ\n\npetition has become infructuous. It has also been stated that though\n\naccording to the seniority in the cadre of Junior Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-B, the names of respondents No.4 to 6 were at serial Nos.10,\n\n15 & 21 in the seniority list, they were kept above the petitioner who\n\nwas at serial No.25. As such, non-promotion of the petitioner with\n\neffect from 4-9-2008 is in accordance with law and the petition\n\ndeserves to be dismissed.\n\n5. The private respondents No.4 to 6 have also filed return in line with\n\nthe return filed by the SECL/respondents No.1 to 3.\n\n6. Mr. Chandresh Shrivastava, learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioner, would submit that admittedly and undisputedly, the criteria\n\nfor promotion on the promotional post of Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-A was merit-cum-seniority and in the bench mark fixed, the\n\npetitioner secured 96 marks, but respondents No.4 to 6 have secured\n\nless marks than the petitioner, even then applying the criteria of\n\nseniority-cum-merit, they have been promoted excluding the petitioner\n\nwhich is per se contrary to the well settled principle in this behalf laid\n\ndown by the Supreme Court in the matter of\nB.V. Sivaiah and others v.\n\nK. Addanki Babu\nand others1 followed subsequently by their Lordships\n\nof the Supreme Court in the matter of\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava and\n\n1 (1998) 6 SCC 720\nothers v. Samyut Kshetriya Gramin Bank and others\n2 and therefore\n\nappropriate writ be issued directing that the petitioner is entitled to be\n\npromoted as Console Operator T&S Grade-A with effect from 4-9-\n\n2008 and also entitled for all consequential service benefits.\n\n7. Mr. Sudhir Kumar Bajpai, learned counsel appearing for the SECL /\n\nrespondents No.1 to 3, would submit that the petition has become\n\ninfructuous as the petitioner has already been granted promotion with\n\neffect from 25-1-2011 on the post of Console Operator T&S Grade-A.\n\nEven otherwise, though the petitioner has secured 96 marks, but since\n\nthe private respondents No.4 to 6 were seniors to the petitioner in\n\nseniority list on the post of Console Operator T&S Grade-B, therefore,\n\nthey were kept above the petitioner and the petitioner was granted\n\npromotion subsequently with effect from 25-1-2011, as such, the writ\n\npetition has no merit.\n\n8. Mr. Rajkamal Singh, learned counsel appearing for respondents No.4\n\nto 6, would adopt the submissions of Mr. Bajpai, learned counsel for\n\nthe SECL/respondents No.1 to 3, and would submit that respondents\n\nNo.4 to 6 were rightly promoted on the post of Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-A.\n\n9. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and considered their rival\n\nsubmissions made herein-above and also went through the record\n\nwith utmost circumspection.\n\n10. Cases of the petitioner, respondents No.4 to 6 and other persons were\n\nconsidered for promotion on the post of Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-A on 28-8-2008 in the meeting of the DPC. According to the\n\nCadre Scheme which is applicable for promotion on the said post i.e.\n\nCadre Scheme for Electronic Data Processing Personnel (Cadre\n\n2 (2010) 1 SCC 335\nScheme No.X) notified on 22-7-1985, promotion for the posts up to\n\nGrade-B shall be on the basis of seniority-cum-merit and from Grade-\n\nB to Grade-A shall be on the basis of merit-cum-seniority. Accordingly,\n\nthe DPC proceeded to consider the cases of eligible candidates\n\nincluding the petitioner, private respondents and other persons and\n\nfixed 70 marks out of 100 as minimum qualifying marks and the\n\nperson getting 70+ will be entitled for consideration on the promotional\n\npost of Console Operator T&S Grade-A. In respect of Annual\n\nConfidential Report (ACR), 20 marks for Outstanding, 18 marks for\n\nVery Good and 16 marks for Good were determined. Accordingly, the\n\nDPC considered the cases of seven candidates and DPC statement\n\nwas drawn by the DPC which is available at page 12 of the writ\n\npetition in which though the petitioner's name was at serial No.8, but\n\nhe has secured 96 marks, however, Sunil Kumar Singh, Subhijit\n\nGoswami and Remant Kumar Gavel - respondents No.4, 5 and 6\n\nherein, respectively, secured 90 marks each out of 100 and they have\n\nbeen promoted. The submission of learned counsel for the SECL is\n\nthat since they stood as seniors in the seniority list in the cadre of\n\nJunior Console Operator T&S Grade-B, therefore, they have been\n\npromoted leaving / excluding the petitioner from the promotional post\n\nof Console Operator T&S Grade-A, though the criteria is merit-cum-\n\nseniority.\n\n11. The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the matter of\nJanki\n\nPrasad Parimoo and others v. State of Jammu & Kashmir and others\n3,\n\nhas clearly held that selection means that the man selected for\n\npromotion must be of merit. Where promotion is by seniority, merit\n\ntakes the second place but when it is a selection, merit takes the first\n\n3 AIR 1973 SC 930\nplace and it is implicit in such selection that the man must not be just\n\naverage.\n\n12. Thereafter, again, the Supreme Court in the matter of Ajit Singh and\n\nothers (II) v. State of Punjab and others4 (Constitution Bench), pointed\n\nout distinction in operation of norms of seniority on the one hand and\n\nany rule requiring consideration of merit on the other hand and\n\nobserved as under: -\n\n\"23. ... if the promotion is by rule of \"seniority-cum-\nsuitability\", the eligible seniors at the basic level as per\nseniority fixed at that level and who are within the zone of\nconsideration must be first considered for promotion and be\npromoted if found suitable. In the promoted category they\nwould have to count their seniority from the date of such\npromotion because they get promotion through a process\nof equal opportunity. Similarly, if the promotion from the\nbasic level is by selection or merit or any rule involving\nconsideration of merit, the senior who is eligible at the\nbasic level has to be considered and if found meritorious in\ncomparison with others, he will have to be promoted first. If\nhe is not found so meritorious, the next in order of seniority\nis to be considered and if found eligible and more\nmeritorious than the first person in the seniority list, he\nshould be promoted. In either case, the person who is first\npromoted will normally count his seniority from the date of\nsuch promotion. (There are minor modifications in various\nservices in the matter of counting of seniority of such\npromotees but in all cases the seniormost person at the\nbasic level is to be considered first and then the others in\nthe line of seniority.) That is how right to be considered for\npromotion and the \"seniority\" attached to such promotion\nbecome important facets of the fundamental right\nguaranteed in\nArticle 16(1).\"\n\n13.\nIn\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra) distinction between seniority-cum-merit and\n\nmerit-cum-seniority has been defined. It has been held by their\n\nLordships of the Supreme Court that the principle of merit-cum-\n\nseniority lays greater emphasis on merit and ability while seniority\n\n4 (1999) 7 SCC 209\nplays a less significant role. It has been observed in paragraphs 9, 10\n\nand 18 of the report as under: -\n\n\"9. The principle of \"merit-cum-seniority\" lays greater\nemphasis on merit and ability and seniority plays a less\nsignificant role. Seniority is to be given weight only when\nmerit and ability are approximately equal.\nIn the context of\nRule 5(2) of the Indian Administrative Service/Indian Police\nService (Appointment by Promotion) Regulations, 1955\nwhich prescribed that \"selection for inclusion in such list\nshall be based on merit and suitability in all respects with\ndue regard to seniority\" Mathew, J. in\nUnion of India v.\nMohan Lal Capoor5\nhas said: (SCC p. 856, para 37)\n\n\"[F]or inclusion in the list, merit and suitability in all\nrespects should be the governing consideration and\nthat seniority should play only a secondary role. It is\nonly when merit and suitability are roughly equal that\nseniority will be a determining factor, or if it is not\nfairly possible to make an assessment inter se of the\nmerit and suitability of two eligible candidates and\ncome to a firm conclusion, seniority would tilt the\nscale.\"\n\nSimilarly, Beg, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was)\nhas said: (SCC p. 851, para 22)\n\n\"22. Thus, we think that the correct view, in\nconformity with the plain meaning of words used in\nthe relevant Rules, is that the 'entrance' or 'inclusion'\ntest for a place on the select list, is competitive and\ncomparative applied to all eligible candidates and not\nminimal like pass marks at an examination. The\nSelection Committee has an unrestricted choice of\nthe best available talent, from amongst eligible\ncandidates, determined by reference to reasonable\ncriteria applied in assessing the facts revealed by\nservice records of all eligible candidates so that merit\nand not mere seniority is the governing factor.\"\n\n10. On the other hand, as between the two principles of\nseniority and merit, the criterion of \"seniority-cum-merit\"\n\nlays greater emphasis on seniority.\nIn\nState of Mysore v.\nSyed Mahmood6\nwhile considering Rule 4(3)(b) of the\nMysore State Civil Services General Recruitment Rules,\n1957 which required promotion to be made by selection on\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit, this Court has observed\n5 (1973) 2 SCC 836\n6 AIR 1968 SC 1113\nthat the rule required promotion to be made by selection on\nthe basis of \"seniority subject to the fitness of the candidate\nto discharge the duties of the post from among persons\neligible for promotion\". It was pointed out that where the\npromotion is based on seniority-cum-merit, the officer\ncannot claim promotion as a matter of right by virtue of his\nseniority alone and if he is found unfit to discharge the\nduties of the higher post, he may be passed over and an\nofficer junior to him may be promoted.\n\n18. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the criterion of\n\"seniority-cum-merit\" in the matter of promotion postulates\nthat given the minimum necessary merit requisite for\nefficiency of administration, the senior, even though less\nmeritorious, shall have priority and a comparative\nassessment of merit is not required to be made. For\nassessing the minimum necessary merit, the competent\nauthority can lay down the minimum standard that is\nrequired and also prescribe the mode of assessment of\nmerit of the employee who is eligible for consideration for\npromotion. Such assessment can be made by assigning\nmarks on the basis of appraisal of performance on the\nbasis of service record and interview and prescribing the\nminimum marks which would entitle a person to be\npromoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\"\n\n14. The principle of law\nlaid down in\n\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra) has been\n\nfollowed with approval by the Supreme Court in\nRajendra Kumar\n\nSrivastava\n(supra) and it has been held in paragraphs 11 and 13 as\n\nunder: -\n\n\"11. It is also well settled that the principle of seniority-\ncum-merit, for promotion, is different from the principle of\n\"seniority\" and the principle of \"merit-cum-seniority\". Where\npromotion is on the basis of seniority alone, merit will not\nplay any part at all. But where promotion is on the principle\nof seniority-cum-merit, promotion is not automatic with\nreference to seniority alone. Merit will also play a\nsignificant role. The standard method of seniority-cum-\nmerit is to subject all the eligible candidates in the feeder\ngrade (possessing the prescribed educational qualification\nand period of service) to a process of assessment of a\nspecified minimum necessary merit and then promote the\ncandidates who are found to possess the minimum\nnecessary merit strictly in the order of seniority. The\nminimum merit necessary for the post may be assessed\neither by subjecting the candidates to a written examination\nor an interview or by assessment of their work performance\nduring the previous years, or by a combination of either two\nor all the three of the aforesaid methods. There is no hard-\nand-fast rule as to how the minimum merit is to be\nascertained. So long as the ultimate promotions are based\non seniority, any process for ascertaining the minimum\nnecessary merit, as a basic requirement, will not militate\nagainst the principle of seniority-cum- merit.\n\n13. Thus it is clear that a process whereby eligible\ncandidates possessing the minimum necessary merit in the\nfeeder posts is first ascertained and thereafter, promotions\nare made strictly in accordance with seniority, from among\nthose who possess the minimum necessary merit is\nrecognised and accepted as complying with the principle of\n\"seniority-cum-merit\". What would offend the rule of\nseniority-cum-merit is a process where after assessing the\nminimum necessary merit, promotions are made on the\nbasis of merit (instead of seniority) from among the\ncandidates possessing the minimum necessary merit. If\nthe criteria adopted for assessment of minimum necessary\nmerit is bona fide and not unreasonable, it is not open to\nchallenge, as being opposed to the principle of seniority-\ncum-merit. We accordingly hold that prescribing minimum\nqualifying marks to ascertain the minimum merit necessary\nfor discharging the functions of the higher post, is not\nviolative of the concept of promotion by seniority-cum-\nmerit.\"\n\n15.\nIn the matter of\nHaryana State Electronics Development Corporation\n\nLimited and others v. Seema Sharma\nand others7, their Lordships of\n\nthe Supreme Court pointed out the distinction between the principles\n\nof \"merit-cum-seniority\" and that of \"seniority-cum-merit\". It was held\n\nas under: -\n\n\"7. The Court is of the opinion that the principle of merit-\ncum-seniority and that of seniority-cum-merit are two totally\ndifferent principles.\n\n8. The principle of merit-cum-seniority puts greater\nemphasis on merit and ability and where promotion is\ngoverned by this principle seniority plays a less significant\nrole. However, seniority is to be given weightage when\nmerit and ability more or less are equal among the\ncandidates who are to be promoted.\n\n7 (2009) 7 SCC 311\n9. On the other hand, insofar as the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit is concerned it gives greater\nimportance to seniority and promotion to a senior person\ncannot be denied unless the person concerned is found\ntotally unfit on merit to discharge the duties of the higher\npost. The totality of the service of the employee has to be\nconsidered for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit (see\nJagathigowda, C.N. v. Cauvery Gramina\nBank8\n).\"\n\n16. Similar proposition has been\nlaid down by\nthe Supreme Court in the\n\nmatter of\nU.V. Mahadkar v. Subhash Anand Chavan\nand others9 and\n\nalso in the matter of\nPalure Bhaskar Rao and others v. P.\n\nRamaseshaiah\nand others10.\n\n17. The distinction pointed out in respect of the principles of seniority-\n\ncum-merit and merit-cum-seniority in\nB.V. Sivaiah\n(supra) and\n\nHaryana State Electronics Development Corporation Limited\n(supra)\n\nwas followed with approval by the Supreme Court in the matter of\n\nSujata Kohli v. Registrar General, High\nCourt of Delhi and others11.\n\n18. Reverting to the facts of the case in the light of the principle of law\nlaid\n\ndown by\ntheir Lordships of the Supreme Court in the aforesaid\n\njudgments (supra), it is quite vivid that in the instant case, admittedly\n\nand undisputedly, the criteria for promotion on the post of Console\n\nOperator T&S Grade-A was merit-cum-seniority and accordingly, the\n\nDPC also proceeded to evaluate the comparative merit of seven\n\ncandidates including the petitioner & respondents No.4 to 6 and in that\n\nprocess, the DPC fixed 70 marks as minimum qualifying marks for\n\nconsideration on the said promotional post (Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-A) and upon comparative assessment, it is also not in dispute\n\nthat the petitioner secured 96 marks i.e. more than respondents No.4\n\n8 (1996) 9 SCC 677\n9 (2016) 1 SCC 536\n10 (2017) 5 SCC 783\n11 (2020) 14 SCC 58\nto 6 which each of them got 90 marks, but respondents No.1 to 3 /\n\nSECL promoted respondents No.4 to 6 on the promotional post of\n\nConsole Operator T&S Grade-A, though they secured less marks than\n\nthe petitioner and did not promote the petitioner holding that\n\nrespondents No.4 to 6 were seniors to the petitioner on the post of\n\nJunior Console Operator T&S Grade-B, and thereby applied the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit, whereas the principle applicable was\n\nmerit-cum-seniority. Once comparative merit has been assessed and\n\nthe petitioner has secured more marks than respondents No.4 to 6,\n\nthe petitioner would be entitled to be considered and promoted on the\n\nsaid promotional post, as he has secured more marks than\n\nrespondents No.4 to 6 and after his promotion, if post is still vacant\n\nthen respondents No.4 to 6 could have been considered and\n\npromoted. As such, the SECL / respondents No.1 to 3 fell into legal\n\nerror in the last stage of DPC proceeding by holding that the petitioner\n\nis not entitled to be promoted though he has obtained 96 marks and\n\nrespondents No.4 to 6 have obtained 90 marks each.\n\n19. Therefore, the petitioner would be entitled for consideration and\n\npromotion on the post of Console Operator T&S Grade-A with effect\n\nfrom 4-9-2008, the date on which respondents No.4 to 6 were\n\npromoted. Since the petitioner has now been promoted with effect\n\nfrom 25-1-2011, it is directed that consequential order of consideration\n\nand promotion of the petitioner on the post of Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-A will be issued by the SECL / respondents No.1 to 3 holding\n\nthat the petitioner is entitled for promotion on the said promotional\n\npost with effect from 4-9-2008 and he will be placed above\n\nrespondents No.4 to 6. The petitioner would also be entitled for all\n\nconsequential benefits including seniority on the post of Console\nOperator T&S Grade-A from 4-9-2008 to 25-1-2011, as on that date he\n\nhad already been promoted to the said post of Console Operator T&S\n\nGrade-A.\n\n20. The writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated herein-above\n\nleaving the parties to bear their own cost(s).\n\nSd/-\n\n(Sanjay K. Agrawal)\nJudge\nSoma",
