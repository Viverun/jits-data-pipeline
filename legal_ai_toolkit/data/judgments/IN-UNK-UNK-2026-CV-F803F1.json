Interim relief in terms of prayer C1, B & C may kindly be\n granted.\"\n\n5. The common facts as per all the three OAs are\n\nas follows:-\n\n5.1 The applicant on selection by Maharashtra\n\nPublic Service Commission was appointed as Deputy\n\nCollector in the Revenue Service of the State of\n\nMaharashtra w.e.f. 09.03.1994. On 03.03.2008, he was\n\n 9 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nserved with the chargesheet with the allegations\n\nthat while working as District Rehabilitation\n\nOfficer in the year 2006 and on being appointed as\n\nReturning Officer for Kalamnuri, Municipal Council,\n\nDistrict Hingoli, State of Maharashtra, as per the\n\nState Election Commission's 2001 Symbol Allotment\n\nTable, he had allotted Symbol 'The Car' to two\n\ncandidates who were contesting the said elections.\n\nThe applicant states that by then he had not\n\nreceived any recent symbol table in which the said\n\nsymbol 'The Car' had been deleted. On 29.04.2009,\n\nthe applicant was promoted as Additional Collector\n\nwhile the chargesheet referred above was still\n\npending against him. Thereafter, he was promoted to\n\nthe post of Additional Collector (Selection Grade)\n\n37,000-67,000 with Grade Pay of Rs.8700/-. At the\n\ntime of filing of the present OA, he was posted as\n\nChairman/Additional Collector (Selection Grade)\n\nCaste Scrutiny Committee, Ahmednagar vide order\n\ndated 05.07.2016.\n\n 10 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n5.2 The applicant contends that being substantive\n\nin the State Civil Service and having completed\n\neight years of continuous service in the post of\n\nDeputy Collector, he is entitled for being\n\nconsidered for appointment by promotion to the\n\nIndian Administrative Service (IAS) as per Section\n\nRegulation 5(2) third proviso which reads as under:\n\n \"Provided also that the Committee shall not consider the\n case of a member of the State Civil Service unless, on the\n first day of January of the year for which the Select List is\n prepared he is substantive in the State Civil Service and has\n completed not less than eight years of continuous service\n (whether officiating or substantive) in the post of Deputy\n Collector or in any other post or posts declared equivalent\n thereto by the State Government.\"\n\n5.3 Further as per Regulation 5(2), the Committee\n\nshall consider for inclusion to the select list, the\n\ncases of members of the State Civil Services in the\n\norder of seniority in that service of a number which\n\nis equal to three times the number referred in sub-\n\nregulation (1).\n\n5.4 The name of the applicant appeared at serial\n\nNo.56 in the seniority list of Deputy Collectors as\n\non 01.04.2009 published by the Government of\n\n 11 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nMaharashtra on 24.09.2009 whereas the names of\n\nrespondent Nos.4 to 6 appeared at serial Nos.57 to\n\n59.\n\n5.5 The select list of the year 2015 was being\n\nconsidered by the respondents in the month of June,\n\n2016. The applicant had submitted his unconditional\n\nwillingness for being appointed by promotion to IAS\n\nvide declaration dated 16.01.2016 (Annex A-7).\n\nHowever, his name was not considered in the select\n\nlist 2015 and he was declared as unfit. He was given\n\nto understand that because of the pending\n\nchargesheet against him, he was not considered for\n\nappointment by promotion to IAS. He preferred\n\nrepresentations, dated 06.07.2016 (Annex A-8) to the\n\nSecretary, DoPT and thereafter dated 06.07.2016\n\n(Annex A-9)to the Chairman UPSC and dated 18.10.2016\n\n(Annex A-10) to the Secretary, DoPT for\n\nreconsideration of his case for appointment by\n\npromotion to IAS by reviewing the Selection\n\nCommittee Meeting dated 20.06.2016.\n\n 12 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n6. The applicant was exonerated of the\n\nchargesheet referred above vide order dated\n\n27.11.2017. No adverse remarks or below benchmarks\n\nwere ever communicated to him, therefore, he ought\n\nto have been appointed by promotion to IAS but\n\nsurprisingly his name again did not figure in the\n\nselect list of 2017 vide Notification dated\n\n27.11.2018 (Annex A-1) and was again declared as\n\n''unfit'. There was no response from the respondents\n\nto his representation dated 12.12.2018 (Annex A-6)\n\nfor reviewing the Selection Committee Proceedings\n\ndated 28.05.2018 and 31.10.2018 respectively. He\n\nfurther states that since there was nothing adverse\n\non record against him, therefore, there was no\n\nreason to exclude his name or to declare him as\n\n'únfit' instead his name could be kept in a sealed\n\ncover till grant of appropriate integrity\n\ncertificate to him by the appropriate authority.\n\n6.1 The respondents Nos.4 to 8 who are junior to\n\nhim were promoted to IAS vide order dated 27.11.2018\n\n 13 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nwhich was challenged by him vide OA No.125/2019. The\n\nsaid OA was disposed of by the Tribunal vide order\n\ndated 14.02.2019 directing the respondents to\n\nconsider his representation dated 12.12.2018 and to\n\npass appropriate orders. The respondents rejected\n\nthe representation vide order dated 19.03.2019\n\n(Annex A-2) on the grounds that since he was found\n\n'unfit' by the Selection Committee, thus could not\n\nbe appointed by promotion to IAS.\n\n7. OA No.426/2020 was filed by the applicant on\n\n11.12.2020. Later on, with the permission of the\n\nTribunal, the same was amended vide order dated\n\n06.07.2021. Vide this OA, he has challenged the\n\nselect list of the year 2018 issued vide Selection\n\nCommittee Proceedings dated 07.08.2020 followed by\n\nNotification dated 03.09.2020. Vide these\n\nproceedings, the applicant was again declared unfit\n\nto be appointed by promotion to IAS cadre. The\n\napplicant contends that the Minutes of the Selection\n\nCommittee Meeting do not disclose pendency of any DE\n\n 14 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nagainst the applicant or existence of any adverse\n\nconfidential remarks which are not expunged or\n\notherwise any adverse material that may have come to\n\nthe notice of the State Government and details of\n\nwhich have been communicated to the Central\n\nGovernment, pendency of any criminal proceedings or\n\nwithholding of certificate of integrity qua the\n\napplicant.\n\n7.1 The applicant contends that he has already\n\nbeen exonerated in the DE proceedings. The single\n\nACR for the period of six months i.e. from\n\n19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012 which was graded as Average\n\nhas now been upgraded to Good vide order dated\n\n27.03.2017. There was nothing adverse against the\n\napplicant to his knowledge/communicated to him, so\n\ntherefore there was no occasion to exclude his name\n\nfrom the select list for the year 2018.\n\n7.2 Under RTI, the applicant sought the copy of\n\nACR for the year 2014-2015 which was B+ but was\n\nnever communicated to him in the regular course. The\n\n 15 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nsame was placed before the UPSC Selection Committee\n\nand forms the basis of rejection of his candidature,\n\nas the consistent record required of an officer for\n\nprevious five years has to be A or A+ for\n\nconsideration for appointment to IAS by promotion.\n\nThe decision of the Selection Committee declaring\n\nthe applicant has unfit for Select List 2015, 2017\n\nand 2018 respectively is termed as arbitrary,\n\nillogical, unreasonable and illegal.\n\n7.3 Reliance has been placed on the judgment of\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nAnil Kumar Vs.\n\nUnion of India & Ors\n reported in MANU/SC/009/2019\n\nwhereby the Hon'ble Apex Court relying on its own\n\njudgment of Dev Dutt's case held that 'consideration of an\n\nACR which is not communicated to the employee for purpose of determining\n\nsuitability of employee for promotion would render the decision bad in law\n\nand liable to be set aside'.\n\n8. The applicant seeks directions to the\n\nrespondents to call a review of the Selection\n\nCommittee meeting for Select List 2015, Select List\n\n 16 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n2017 and 2018 respectively and to consider his name\n\nfor appointment by promotion to IAS, if necessary,\n\nto quash and set aside the impugned order dated\n\n08.07.2016, 31.10.2018 and 07.08.2020. He further\n\nseeks appointment by promotion to IAS with all\n\nconsequential reliefs including arrears of pay,\n\nseniority etc. and to place him above the private\n\nrespondents.\n\n9 Reliance has been placed on the judgment of\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dev Dutt Vs. Union\n\nof India & Ors. (Civil Appeal No.7631 of 2002)\n\ncontending that the adverse ACRs which were not\n\ncommunicated to him, could not have been\n\nconsidered while deciding his suitability for\n\nappointment by promotion to IAS. His contention is\n\nthat all the last five years ACRs which are relevant\n\nfor the purposes of preparing the select list of\n\n2018 are in his favour. He also quotes that the\n\ncandidates who have got their ACRs upgraded for two\n\nor more years have also been considered positively\n\n 17 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nby the Selection Committee meeting and their names\n\nfeature in the final select list.\n\n9.1 Reference has been made to G.R. dated\n\n01.11.2011. Vide its instructions No.27(A) of the\n\nsaid GR, the ACR is required to be mandatorily\n\ncommunicated to the employee concerned before 30th of\n\nJune of the particular year, particularly, when the\n\nACRs have any adverse entries or an overall grade of\n\naverage or below which would affect negatively the\n\nprospects of the employee being considered\n\nfavourably for promotion when due. The decision\n\ndated 07.08.2020 of the Selection Committee Meeting\n\nis apparently based on such ACR which has never\n\ncommunicated to the applicant and, therefore, it\n\nshould not have been placed for consideration before\n\nthe Selection Committee. The applicant could not\n\nhave been declared unfit on the basis of\n\nuncommunicated adverse ACR.\n\n9.2 The applicant has further brought to our\n\nnotice that he had filed OA No.125/2019 in respect\n\n 18 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nof year 2017 which was disposed of vide order dated\n\n14.02.2019 directing the respondents to consider the\n\nrepresentation of the applicant and to pass an\n\nappropriate order. The respondents rejected the\n\nrepresentation vide order dated 19.03.2019 (Annex A-\n\n8)without making any independent or fresh\n\napplication of mind. He filed further representation\n\ndated 21.09.2020 for the year 2018. However, the\n\napplicant has not been communicated any decision on\n\nthe same.\n\n9.3 On getting this information under RTI that\n\nhis ACR for the year 2014-2015 was B+, he preferred\n\nrepresentations dated 01.02.2021 (Annex A-10) and\n\n06.02.2021 to UPSC-Respondent No.2 against non-\n\ncommunication of the ACR and consequential denial of\n\nan opportunity to make representation for\n\nreconsideration and upgradation of the ACR. The\n\nsame was forwarded by UPSC to the State Government\n\nfor appropriate action as per law. It is only,\n\nthereafter, the applicant was provided with the copy\n\n 19 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nof ACR of 2014-2015 and was directed to submit\n\nrepresentation, if so desired, for upgradation. He\n\nmade representation dated 15.02.2021 for upgradation\n\nof his ACR for the aforesaid period. Vide G.R. dated\n\n30.03.2021 (Annex A-11), the department of Revenue\n\nand Forest, Government of Maharashtra was pleased to\n\nnotify its decision to upgrade the said ACR (2014-\n\n2015)from B+ to A Grade. The ACR for the year 2014-\n\n2015 falls within the five year period for effecting\n\nappointment by promotion to the IAS from officers in\n\nState Service cadre for the years 2016 to 2018 which\n\nare the subject matter of all the three OAs under\n\nconsideration.\n\n9.4 The applicant has termed the decision taken\n\nin the Selection Committee Meetings held on various\n\ndates for the select years 2015, 2017 and 2018\n\ndeclaring him 'unfit' for appointment by promotion\n\nto the IAS as illegal being based on adverse ACRs\n\nfor the year 2012-2013 and 2014-2015, which were\n\nnever communicated to him. These ACRs have now been\n\n 20 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nupgraded, therefore, the applicant seeks quashing\n\nand setting aside of the impugned selection\n\ncommittee decisions dated 20.06.2016, 27.11.2018 &\n\n07.08.2020 and for direction to conduct review of\n\nselection committee meetings for all these years.\n\n10. The respondent No.1 i.e. Union of India has\n\nnot filed reply to any of these OAs though Shri R.R.\n\nShetty regularly appeared in these cases and made\n\nhis oral submissions.\n\n11. The respondent No.2 i.e. UPSC filed its\n\ndetailed reply to all the OAs admitting all the\n\nfacts of the case. However, it is submitted that the\n\nUPSC discharge its functions and duties assigned to\n\nit under \nArticle 320\n of the Constitution. By virtue\n\nof the provisions in the All India Service Act 1951,\n\nseparate Recruitment Rules have been framed for\n\nIAS/IPS & IFS. In pursuance to these Rules, the\n\nRegulations, 1955 have been framed. As per the\n\nprovisions of these regulations, the Selection\n\nCommittee presided over by the Chairman/Member of\n\n 21 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nthe UPSC makes Selection from State Revenue\n\nService(SRS) officers for appointment to the IAS by\n\npromotion.\n\n11.1 As per the regulation 5(1) of Promotion\n\nRegulations, the number of vacancies against which\n\nthe Selection is to be made for a particular Select\n\nList for promotion to the IAS of a State Cadre is\n\ndetermined by the Government of India(DoP&T) in\n\nconsultation with the State Government concerned.\n\nThereafter, the State Government forwards a proposal\n\nto the Commission alongwith the seniority List,\n\nEligibility List of the State Revenue Service\n\nofficers, integrity certificate, certificates\n\nregarding disciplinary/criminal proceedings\n\ncertificate regarding communication of adverse\n\nremarks, details of penalties imposed on the\n\neligible officers etc. and complete ACR dossiers of\n\nthe eligible officers. These documents are then\n\nexamined by the Commission and placed before the\n\nSelection Committee for preparation of Select List.\n\n 22 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n11.2 In accordance with the provisions of\n\nRegulation 5(4), the Selection Committee classifies\n\nthe eligible State Revenue Service Officers included\n\nin the zone of consideration as 'Outstanding', 'Very\n\nGood', 'Good' or 'Unfit' as the case may be, on an\n\noverall relative assessment of their service record.\n\n11.3 Thereafter, as per the provisions of\n\nRegulation 5(5), the Selection Committee prepares a\n\nlist by including the required number of names,\n\nfirstly from among the officers finally classified\n\nas 'Outstanding', then from those who are classified\n\nas 'Very Good' and thereafter from amongst those who\n\nare classified as 'Good' while maintaining their\n\nrespective inter se seniority within each category.\n\n11.4 The Selection Committee is not guided merely\n\nby the overall grading that may be recorded in the\n\nACRs but makes its own assessment on the basis of\n\nexamination of service records of eligible officers,\n\ndeliberating on the quality of the officers on the\n\nbasis of his performance as reflected under various\n\n 23 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\ncolumns recorded by the reporting officer/reviewing\n\nofficer/accepting authority in the ACRs for\n\ndifferent years and then finally arrives at the\n\nclassification to be assigned to each eligible\n\nofficer in accordance with provisions of promotion\n\nregulations. The Selection Committee not only takes\n\ninto account orders regarding appreciation for\n\nmeritorious work done by the concerned officer but\n\nalso keeps in view orders awarding penalties or any\n\nadverse remarks communicated to the officers, which\n\neven after due consideration of his representation\n\nhave not been completely expunged.\n\n11.5 As per provisions of Regulation 6 and 6A, the\n\nState Government and Central Government are required\n\nto furnish their observations to the Selection\n\nCommittee. The final decision is taken by the\n\nSelection Committee under provisions of Regulation 7\n\nafter considering the observations of the State\n\nGovernment and the Central Government and the\n\nrequisite records received from the State\n\n 24 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nGovernment. Finally, the appointments to the IAS are\n\nmade from the Select List by the Government of\n\nIndia, DoPT.\n\n11.6 In reply to OA No.768/2016, the respondent\n\nNo.2 stated that the applicant was assessed as\n\n'Average' for two years i.e. 2012-2013 and 2014-2015\n\nwhereas he was assessed as 'Very Good' for the rest\n\nof three years. On the basis of this yearwise\n\nassessment, the Selection Committee overall assessed\n\nhim 'unfit' whereas the private respondents were\n\nassessed as 'Very Good' for all the five years. On\n\nthe basis of the overall grading of the applicant\n\nand the private respondents, the name of the\n\napplicant was not included in the select list of\n\n2015.\n\n11.7. Regarding OA No.390/2019 and OA No. 426/2020,\n\nagain it is repeated by respondent No.2 that in the\n\nAssessment Matrix of five years from 2012-2013 to\n\n2016-2017 for the select list of 2017 and from 2013-\n\n14 to 2017-18 for the Select list 2018, the\n\n 25 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nSelection Committee assessed him as 'unfit\" due to\n\n'Average' grading for the year 2014-15, therefore,\n\nhis name was not included in the Select List 2017 &\n\n2018 whereas the name of six officers junior to him\n\nwho were overall assessed as 'Very Good' were\n\nincluded in the select list.\n\n12. In reply to OA No. 768/2016, respondent No.3\n\nstates that so far the promotion of the applicant to\n\nthe cadre of Additional Collector and Additional\n\nCollector (Selection Grade) is concerned, the same\n\nwas subject to outcome of the departmental inquiry\n\naccording to the policy of General Administration\n\nDepartment as per the Government circular dated\n\n02.04.1976. It is stated that for the select list of\n\n2015, the State Government had withheld the\n\nintegrity certificate of the applicant on account of\n\npending departmental inquiry which has now been\n\nconcluded and the applicant is acquitted of all the\n\ncharges vide Government order dated 27.11.2017.\n\n12.1 Regarding the gradings obtained by the\n\n 26 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\napplicant during the relevant period, it is stated\n\nthat the applicant had been graded as Average for\n\nthe period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012. Therefore, he\n\nwas not eligible for promotion to IAS. At the same\n\ntime, it is stated that the said gradation has been\n\nupgraded as Good by Government order dated\n\n27.03.2017 by expunging the adverse remarks.\n\nThereafter, the State Government sent the proposal\n\nfor promotion of applicant to the Indian\n\nAdministrative Service for select list of 2017 in\n\nthe light of his upgraded ACRs.\n\n13. The respondent Nos.3 & 4 in reply to the OA\n\nNo.390/2019 have stated that the present OA is\n\ndevoid of merits.\n\n14. In the rejoinder filed by the applicant to\n\nthe reply of respondents Nos.2, 3 & 4, it is\n\nsubmitted that for the select list of the years 2015\n\nto 2018, the relevant confidential reports were for\n\nthe years from 2009 onwards. He was communicated\n\nwith the ACR for the period from 19.06.2012 to\n\n 27 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n14.12.2012 as 'Average' by the respondent No.3 on\n\n22.11.2016. UPSC took into consideration the said\n\nadverse report which was never communicated to him\n\nprior to holding of the Selection Committee Meeting\n\non 10.06.2016. The said ACR had now been upgraded to\n\n'Good' vide communication dated 27.03.2017.\n\n14.1 Similarly, the adverse ACR for the year 2014-\n\n15 was not communicated to him but taken into\n\nconsideration by the UPSC during its meeting for the\n\nSelect Year 2017 and 2018 respectively. The same was\n\ncommunicated to him after the Select Committee\n\nMeeting 2018 and on the representation of the\n\napplicant, the same has been upgraded as 'A' vide\n\norder dated 30.03.2021.\n\n15. We have heard the arguments addressed by\n\nlearned counsels for the parties.\n\n16. Shri Deshmukh, learned counsel for the\n\napplicant relies upon the G.R. dated 01.11.2011.\n\nVide instruction No.27(A) of the said G.R., the ACR\n\nis required to be mandatorily communicated to the\n\n 28 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nemployee concerned before 30th June of the year and\n\nit is more so when the ACR has any adverse entries\n\nor an overall grade of 'Average' or below which\n\nwould affect negatively the prospects of the\n\nemployee being considered favourably for promotion\n\nwhen due. The G.R. lays down the procedure including\n\ntimelines for preparation and communication of ACR,\n\nto hear the representation of the concerned employee\n\non the ACR and also deals with its upgradation.\n\nLearned counsel has also argued that non\n\ncommunicated adverse ACRs would be non est in the\n\neyes of law and cannot be considered against the\n\nemployees. He further argues that the decision of\n\nthe Selection Committee Meetings for the select\n\nyears 2015, 2017 and 2018 respectively are based on\n\nACRs which were though adverse but had not been\n\ncommunicated to the applicant before respective\n\nSelection Committee Meetings and the applicant had\n\nnot been given an opportunity to make\n\nrepresentations to the respondents for their\n\n 29 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nupgradation. Further, that all the ACRs which have\n\nbeen communicated to him were either 'A' or 'A+',\n\ntherefore, the applicant could not have been\n\ndeclared as 'unfit' in any of the Selection\n\nCommittee Meetings.\n\n17. Shri Atre, learned counsel for the applicant\n\nin OA No.768/2016 and 390/2019 has filed written\n\nsubmissions in OA No.768/2016 and has brought to our\n\nnotice the Decision No.8(1) under 'Appointment by\n\nPromotion', Regulations 1955 which makes it\n\nmandatory for the State Government to furnish a\n\ncertificate to the Selection Committee that the\n\nadverse remarks are communicated to the eligible\n\nofficer, whether any representation is received from\n\nhim or not and whether representation is received\n\nwithin time but decision thereon is pending etc. He\n\nfurther argues that the respondent No.3 had not\n\nfurnished the correct information to the Selection\n\nCommittee and therefore the adverse remarks against\n\nthe applicant were taken into consideration during\n\n 30 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nthe relevant Selection Committee Meetings though in\n\nfact these adverse remarks were never communicated\n\nto the applicant and thus could not have been taken\n\ninto consideration against his interest. He relies\n\nupon the following judgments:-\n\n(\ni) Dev Dutta Vs. Union of India\n, 200(7) SCALE 403.\n\n(\nii)Abhijit Ghosh Dastidar Vs. Union of India & Others\n passed by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in Civil Appeal No.6227/2008 (arising out of SLP (C)\n\nNo.26556/2004.\n\n(iii) Satya pal \nArora vs. Central Administrative Tribunal\n decided by Hon'ble\n\nPunjab & Haryana High Court vide Civil Writ Petition No.24614 of 2016\n\ndecided on 15.02.201.\n\n(iv) Shri Appaso Balappa Dhulaj Vs. Union of India & 4 Ors., OA\n\nNo.2075/2017, decided by this bench itself vide order dated 11.04.2018\n\n18. During the course of arguments, Shri Shetty\n\non behalf of Union of India, raised objection that\n\nsubsequent to the filing of OA No.768/2016, the ACR\n\nfor the period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012 was upgraded\n\nfrom Average to Good. However, the applicant has not\n\namended his OA, therefore, this fact cannot be taken\n\n 31 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\ninto consideration while disposing of this OA.\n\n19. After hearing the submissions of learned\n\ncounsels for the parties, we have perused the record\n\ncarefully and have also gone through the relevant\n\njudgments on the issue under consideration.\n\n20. In the present case, the applicant has\n\nchallenged and sought quashing and setting aside of\n\nthe select lists for the years 2015, 2017 and 2018\n\nrespectively for the reason that in the Selection\n\nCommittee Meetings for all these years the adverse\n\nentries against the applicant for the year 2012-2013\n\nand 2014-2015, which were not communicated to him\n\nand he had not been granted an opportunity to make\n\nrepresentation for expunging adverse remarks, were\n\ntaken into consideration and he was declared 'unfit'\n\nfor appointment by promotion to IAS. The respondent\n\nNos.3 & 4 admitted that these adverse entries were\n\ncommunicated to the applicant after the meetings of\n\nthe Selection Committee for the select lists years\n\n2015, 2017 and 2018 respectively. They submit that\n\n 32 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\non the representations of the applicant, these\n\nadverse remarks have been expunged and his ACRs have\n\nbeen upgraded. The ACR for the year 2012-2013 i.e.\n\nfor the period 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012 was\n\ninitially 'Average'. On his representation, it was\n\nupgraded to 'Good' vide order dated 27.03.2017. The\n\napplicant in his rejoinder has categorically\n\nmentioned that this ACR was communicated to him by\n\nthe Govt of maharashtra on 22.11.2016 ie. after the\n\ndate of Select Committee Meeting for Select List\n\n2015. Similarly, the ACR for the year 2014-2015 was\n\nnot communicated to him. He obtained information\n\nunder \nRTI Act\n and thereafter, during the pendency of\n\nthe present proceedings, he learnt that the ACR for\n\nthe period from 01.04.2014 to 31.03.2015 is B+,\n\nwhich was never communicated to him before the same\n\nwas relied upon by the Select Committee in its\n\nmeeting for the Select List 2017-18. He applicant\n\nmade representation for its upgradation and\n\nthereafter, it was upgraded from B+ to A grade vide\n\n 33 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nGR. Dated 30.03.2021.\n\n21. It is painful to observe that both the\n\nadverse ACRs ie. for the period for 19.06.2012 to\n\n14.12.2012 and for the period 01.04.2014 to\n\n31.03.2015, which were adverse to the applicant,\n\nwere never communicated to him and were made basis\n\nfor rejection of his candidature for appointment by\n\npromotion to IAS.\n\n22. It is settled proposition of law as per\n\nvarious Supreme Court judgments that uncommunicated\n\nadverse ACRs cannot be considered resulting in\n\ndenial of benefits to a Government Servant where\n\nsimilar benefits are extended to his juniors. The\n\npurpose of communication of adverse entries is to\n\ngive a warning to a Govt employee to improve his\n\nperformance. At the same time, it affords him\n\nopportunity to explain his conduct so as to show\n\nthat adverse entry was unwarranted.\n\n22.1 The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nAmarkant Chaudhary Vs. State of Bihar (1984) 1 SCC\n\n 34 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n694 made the following observations in para 8 of the\n\njudgment:-\n\n \"8. After giving our anxious consideration to the uncontroverted\n material placed before us we have reached the conclusion that the\n case of the appellant for promotion to the Indian Police Service\n Cadre has not been considered by the Committee in a just and fair\n way and his case has been disposed of contrary to the principles\n laid down in Gurdial Singh Fijji's case (supra). The decisions of the\n Selection Committee recorded at its meetings in which the case of\n the appellant was considered are vitiated by reason of reliance\n being placed on the adverse remarks which were later on expunged.\n The High Court committed an error in dismissing the petition of the\n appellant and its order is, therefore, liable to be set aside. We\n accordingly set aside the order of the High Court. We hold that the\n appellant has made out a case for reconsideration of the question of\n his promotion to the Indian Police Service Cadre of the State of\n Bihar as on December 22, 1976 and if he is not selected as on that\n date for being considered again as on March 12, 1981. If he is not\n selected as on March 12, 1981 his case has to be considered as on\n October 14, 1981. The Selection Committee has now to reconsider\n the case of the appellant accordingly after taking into consideration\n the orders passed by the State Government subsequently on any\n adverse entry that may have been made earlier and any other order\n of similar nature pertaining to the service of the appellant. If on\n such reconsideration the appellant is selected he shall be entitled to\n the seniority and all other consequential benefits flowing\n therefrom. We issue a direction to the respondents to reconsider the\n case of the appellant as stated above. We hope that the above\n direction will be complied with expeditiously but not later than\n four months from today.\"\n\n22.2 The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dev\n\nDutt (supra) is of the opinion that not only adverse\n\nentries but every entry must be communicated to the\n\nemployee concerned so that he may have an\n\nopportunity of making a representation against it if\n\nhe is aggrieved. Its non communication deprives the\n\n 35 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nemployee of the opportunity of making a\n\nrepresentation against it which may effect his\n\nchances of being promoted or to get some other\n\nbenefits. The Hon'ble Apex Court in this case made\n\nthe following observations in paras 11, 13, 14 & 39:\n\n 11. Hence, in our opinion, the 'good' entry should have been\n communicated to the appellant so as to enable him to make a\n representation praying that the said entry for the year 1993-94 should be\n upgraded from 'good' to 'very good'. Of course, after considering such a\n representation it was open to the authority concerned to reject the\n representation and confirm the 'good' entry (though of course in a fair\n manner), but at least an opportunity of making such a representation\n should have been given to the appellant, and that would only have been\n possible had the appellant been communicated the 'good' entry, which was\n not done in this case. Hence, we are of the opinion that the non-\n\n communication of the 'good' entry was arbitrary and hence illegal, and the\n decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent are\n distinguishable.\n\n \n13. It has been held in \nManeka Gandhi vs. Union of India & Anr.\n AIR 1978\n SC 597 that arbitrariness violates \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. In our\n opinion, the non-communication of an entry in the A.C.R. of a public\n servant is arbitrary because it deprives the concerned employee from\n making a representation against it and praying for its up-gradation.\n \nIn our\n opinion, every entry in the Annual Confidential Report of every employee\n under the State, whether he is in civil, judicial, police or other service\n (except the military) must be communicated to him, so as to enable him to\n make a representation against it, because non-communication deprives the\n employee of the opportunity of making a representation against it which\n may affect his chances of being promoted (or get some other\n benefits).Moreover, the object of writing the confidential report and making\n entries in them is to give an opportunity to a public servant to improve his\n performance, vide \nState of U.P. vs. Yamuna Shankar Misra\n 1997 (4) SCC 7.\n Hence such non-communication is, in our opinion, arbitrary and hence\n violative of \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution.\n\n 14. In our opinion, every entry (and not merely a poor or adverse entry)\n relating to an employee under the State or an instrumentality of the State,\n whether in civil, judicial, police or other service (except the military) must\n be communicated to him, within a reasonable period, and it makes no\n difference whether there is a bench mark or not. Even if there is no bench\n\n 36 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\n mark, non-communication of an entry may adversely affect the employee's\n chances of promotion (or getting some other benefit), because when\n comparative merit is being considered for promotion (or some other\n benefit) a person having a `good' or `average' or `fair' entry certainly has\n less chances of being selected than a person having a `very good' or\n `outstanding' entry.\n\n \n39. In the present case, we are developing the principles of natural justice\n by holding that fairness and transparency in public administration requires\n that all entries (whether poor, fair, average, good or very good) in the\n Annual Confidential Report of a public servant, whether in civil, judicial,\n police or any other State service (except the military), must be\n communicated to him within a reasonable period so that he can make a\n representation for its upgradation. This in our opinion is the correct legal\n position even though there may be no Rule/G.O. requiring communication\n of the entry, or even if there is a Rule/G.O. prohibiting it, because the\n principle of non-arbitrariness in State action as envisaged by \nArticle 14\n of\n the Constitution in our opinion requires such communication. \nArticle 14\n\n will override all rules or government orders.\"\n\nThe law \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\n\ncase of Dev Dutt(supra) has been followed in the\n\ncase of Sukhdev Singh vs. union of \nIndia (2013) 9\n\nSCC 566, Abhijeet Ghosh Dastidar vs. Union of India\n\n(\n2009) 16 SCC 146 and Anil Kumar & Ors vs\n\nUOI\n(supra).\n\n23. In the present case, the action of Respondent\n\nNos. 3 and 4 in not communicating the ACR for the\n\nperiod 19.06.2012 to 14.12.2012(2012-13) and\n\n01.04.2014 to 31.03.2015(2014-15) in our opinion is\n\narbitrary and violative of principles of natural\n\njustice. Due to such inaction of respondents, the\n\n 37 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\napplicant was declared as unfit for appointment by\n\npromotion to IAS for the Select List 2015, 2017 and\n\n2018 respectively, without affording him an\n\nopportunity to make representation against the\n\nadverse ACRs. Even UPSC ought have not considered\n\nthe adverse entries against the applicant, without\n\nverifying as to whether the adverse entries in the\n\nACRs were communicated to him, whether he had made\n\nany representation thereon, and if so, what is the\n\noutcome of the representation, particularly, when\n\nthe State Govt had withheld the issuance of\n\nintegrity certificate.\n\n24. Shri Shetty has argued that after the\n\nupgradation of ACRs for the period 19.06.2012 to\n\n14.12.2012, from B to B+, the applicant ought have\n\namended OA No. 768/2016. Since, he has not amended\n\nthe OA, this fact cannot be taken into consideration\n\nwhile passing final order. However, we are not\n\nimpressed by this argument as admittedly the\n\napplicant had not been communicated with the adverse\n\n 38 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nACR against him at the relevant time and therefore,\n\nthe same ought not have been taken into\n\nconsideration during the Selection Committee Meeting\n\naffecting the applicant adversely. Since the\n\nrespondents have now brought this fact on record\n\nthat the said ACR has already been upgraded from\n\nAverage to Good, therefore, this fact is already\n\nnoticed by this Tribunal while taking judicial note\n\nof the same.\n\n25. After giving thoughtful consideration to the\n\nundisputed material on record, we are of the opinion\n\nthat the Selection Committee has not considered the\n\ncase of the applicant for appointment by promotion\n\nto the IAS in just and fair manner. The Selection\n\nCommittee's decisions in its meetings held for\n\nSelect List 2015, 2017 and 2018 respectively stand\n\nvitiated as these were based on adverse ACRs which\n\nwere never communicated to the applicant.\n\nAdmittedly, later on, the adverse remarks have been\n\nexpunged. The applicant has squarely made out a\n\n 39 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\ncase for reconsideration of the question of his\n\nappointment by promotion to the IAS. In the\n\ncircumstances, the decision of the Selection\n\nCommittee in its meetings dated 08.07.2016,\n\n27.11.2018 and 07.08.2020, qua the applicant\n\ndeclaring him unfit are quashed and set aside. The\n\nrespondents are directed to constitute Review\n\nSelection Committee for the Select List 2015, 2017\n\nand 2018 and to consider afresh the case of\n\napplicant for appointment by promotion to the IAS\n\ntaking into consideration the orders passed by the\n\nState Govt recalling the adverse entries in the ACR\n\nand upgrading the same. If, on such consideration,\n\nthe applicant is not selected for the Select List\n\n2015, he be considered for the Select List 2017.\n\nAgain, if he is not selected, his case be considered\n\nfor the Select List 2018. If on such\n\nreconsideration, the applicant is selected, he shall\n\nbe entitled to the seniority and all other\n\nconsequential benefits. The respondents are directed\n\n 40 OA Nos.768/2016,\n\n 390/2019 & 426/2020\n\nto comply with these directions positively within 8\n\nweeks. In view of the above directions, OA Nos.\n\n768/2016, 390/2019 and 426/2020 stand disposed off.\n\nNo order as to costs.\n\n(Ravinder Kaur) (A. Mukhopadhaya)\n Member (J) Member (A)\n\nma.",

After giving our anxious consideration to the uncontroverted\n material placed before us we have reached the conclusion that the\n case of the appellant for promotion to the Indian Police Service\n Cadre has not been considered by the Committee in a just and fair\n way and his case has been disposed of contrary to the principles\n laid down in Gurdial Singh Fijji's case (supra). The decisions of the\n Selection Committee recorded at its meetings in which the case of\n the appellant was considered are vitiated by reason of reliance\n being placed on the adverse remarks which were later on expunged.\n The High Court committed an error in dismissing the petition of the\n appellant and its order is, therefore, liable to be set aside. We\n accordingly set aside the order of the High Court. We hold that the\n appellant has made out a case for reconsideration of the question of\n his promotion to the Indian Police Service Cadre of the State of\n Bihar as on December 22, 1976 and if he is not selected as on that\n date for being considered again as on March 12, 1981. If he is not\n selected as on March 12, 1981 his case has to be considered as on\n October 14, 1981. The Selection Committee has now to reconsider\n the case of the appellant accordingly after taking into consideration\n the orders passed by the State Government subsequently on any\n adverse entry that may have been made earlier and any other order\n of similar nature pertaining to the service of the appellant. If on\n such reconsideration the appellant is selected he shall be entitled to\n the seniority and all other consequential benefits flowing\n therefrom. We issue a direction to the respondents to reconsider the\n case of the appellant as stated above. We hope that the above\n direction will be complied with expeditiously but not later than\n four months from today.\""
