The petitioner incarcerated in the FIR captioned above, had come up before this\nCourt under Section 483 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, [BNSS], seeking\nregular bail.\n\n2. In paragraph 9 of the bail application and the reply/custody certificate, the\naccused has the following criminal antecedents:\n\n Sr. No. FIR No. Date Offenses Police Station\n 1. 41 2015 406, 498A \nIPC\n Jhabal, District Tarn Taran\n 2. 111 2023 21, 29 \nNDPS Act\n Rama Mandi, District Jalandhar\n 3. 53 2022 323, 324, 325, 341, Lopoke, District Amrtisar\n 427, 506, 295, 148\n and 149 \nIPC\n\n 4. 24 1.2.22 323, 324, 452, 506 \nIPC\n Division no.8, Jalandhar City\n and 25 Arms Act\n\n3. The facts and allegations are being extracted from the reply filed by the State,\nwhich reads as follows:\n\n \"3. That it is submitted that as per the report furnished by Station House\n Officer (SHO), Police Station, (P.S.) Rajasansi, Amritsar (Rural), the aforesaid\n FIR No. 149 dated 07.12.2023 (supra), was registered on the basis of\n\n 1\n\n 1 of 5\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 20-02-2025 05:34:20 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:024372\nCRM-M-51511-2024\n\n statement of the Complainant Sukhwant Singh, wherein it was alleged that\n he serves in Rimple Wine Group, circle Ajnala, Amritsar. On 27.11.2023 at\n about 09:15 PM, he and his colleague Karanpreet Singh by riding on firm's\n vehicle Bolero Camper bearing No. PB02-DZ-69831, which was being driven\n by him, were going to village Kohali, PS Lopoke for supply of liquor. At that\n time, Palwinder Singh @ Pappi (present petitioner) and Palwinder Singh @\n Pinder S/o Billa Singh, who were in an inebriated condition came to them\n and asked them why they had parked their vehicle there and started\n abusing them. They (complainant) were going back to Rajasansi on their\n vehicle via village Bhittewad then they (petitioner) chased them in one car\n and came after them at village Bhittewad. At the time of entering village\n Bhittewad, they (petitioner) brought their car in front of their (complainant)\n Bolero camper and stopped it forcibly. They (complainant) alighted from\n their vehicle and ran away in fear and on the way they (complainant)\n informed his cousin Akashdeep Singh over phone that they complainant)\n had altercation with the above said persons (petitioner) who were chasing\n them to attack them. In the meantime, Akashdeep Singh also came there.\n The above said persons caused him injuries and vandalized their\n (complainant) vehicle and fired straight fires with an intention to kill them\n (complainant). Thereafter they (complainant. can away from the spot in\n fear and saved their lives. The respectable persons of village Bhittewad and\n village Kohali tried to make compromise between them, which could not be\n arrived at. Therefore, the instant FIR No. 149 dated 7.12.2023, under\n \nSection 307\n/\n341\n/\n427\n/\n506\n/\n34\n IPC, 25 \nArms Act\n, Police Station Rajasansi,\n Amritsar Rural was registered.\"\n\n3. The petitioner's counsel prays for bail by imposing any stringent conditions and\ncontends that further pre-trial incarceration would cause an irreversible injustice to the\npetitioner and their family. She further submits that the main accused Palwinder Singh\n@ Pinder has already been granted the concession of anticipatory bail vide order dated\n6.3.2024 passed by this Court in CRM-M-1276-2024 and the petitioner is not only\nentitled for same benefit on parity, but his case is on better footing.\n\n4. The State's counsel opposes bail and refers to the reply.\n\n5. It would be appropriate to refer to the following portions of the reply, which\nread as follows:\n\n \"10. That it is submitted that at the time of commission of crime, the present\n petitioner Palwinder Singh @ Pappi was armed with baseball and he vandalized\n Bolero Camper of the complainant and caused injuries to the injured\n Akashdeep Singh with his baseball. The co- accused Palwinder Singh @ Pinder\n with common intention of both of them had fired gunshots from DBBL gun at\n the complainant party with an intention to kill them. However, they remained\n unhurt.\"\n\n6. There is sufficient prima facie evidence connecting the petitioner with the\nalleged crime. However, pre-trial incarceration should not be a replica of post-\nconviction sentencing.\n\n 2\n\n 2 of 5\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 20-02-2025 05:34:21 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:024372\nCRM-M-51511-2024\n\n7. Per paragraph 11 of the bail petition, the petitioner has been in custody since\n7.12.2023. Per the custody certificate dated 17.01.2025, the petitioner's total custody\nin this FIR is 1 year, 1 month and 2 days.\n\n8. Given the penal provisions invoked viz-a-viz pre-trial custody, coupled with the\nprima facie analysis of the nature of allegations and the other factors peculiar to this\ncase, there would be no justifiability further pre-trial incarceration at this stage, subject\nto the compliance of terms and conditions mentioned in this order.\n\n9. Admittedly, co-accused of the petitioner has already been granted anticipatory\nbail.\n\n10. Without commenting on the case's merits, in the facts and circumstances\npeculiar to this case, and for the reasons mentioned above, the petitioner makes a case\nfor bail. This order shall come into force from the time it is uploaded on this Court's\nofficial webpage.\n\n11. Given above, provided the petitioner is not required in any other case, the\npetitioner shall be released on bail in the FIR captioned above subject to furnishing\nbonds to the satisfaction of the concerned Court and due to unavailability before any\nnearest Illaqa Magistrate/duty Magistrate. Before accepting the surety, the concerned\nCourt must be satisfied that if the accused fails to appear, such surety can produce the\naccused.\n\n12. While furnishing a personal bond, the petitioner shall mention the\nfollowing personal identification details:\n\n 1. AADHAR number\n\n 2. Passport number (If available) and when the\n attesting officer/court considers it appropriate or\n considers the accused a flight risk.\n\n 3. Mobile number (If available)\n\n 4. E-Mail id (If available)\n\n13. The petitioner shall abide by all statutory bond conditions and appear before\nthe concerned Court(s) on all dates. The petitioner shall not tamper with the evidence,\ninfluence, browbeat, pressurize, induce, threaten, or promise, directly or indirectly, any\nwitnesses, Police officials, or any other person acquainted with the facts and\ncircumstances of the case or dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the Police or\nthe Court.\n\n14. Given the nature of the allegations and the other circumstances peculiar to this\ncase, the petitioner shall not enter the property, workplace, and residence of the victim\n\n 3\n\n 3 of 5\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 20-02-2025 05:34:21 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:024372\nCRM-M-51511-2024\n\nuntil the statements of all non-official and informal witnesses in the trial are recorded.\nThis Court is imposing this condition to rule out any attempt by the accused to\nincapacitate, influence, or cause any discomfort to the victim. Reference be made to\n\nVikram Singh v Central Bureau of Investigation\n, 2018 All SCR (Crl.)\n \n458); and \nAparna\nBhatt v. The State of Madhya Pradesh\n, 2021:INSC:192, 2021 SCC Online SC 230.\n\n15. Given the background of allegations against the petitioner, it becomes\nparamount to protect the victim, and their family members, as well as the members of\nsociety, and incapacitating the accused would be one of the primary options until the\nfiling of the closure report or discharge, or acquittal. Consequently, it would be\nappropriate to restrict the possession of firearm(s). [This restriction is being imposed\nbased on the preponderance of evidence of probability and not of evidence of\ncertainty, i.e., beyond reasonable doubt; and as such, it is not to be construed as an\nintermediate sanction]. Given the nature of the allegations and the other\ncircumstances peculiar to this case, the petitioner shall surrender all weapons,\nfirearms, and ammunition, if any, along with the arms license to the concerned\nauthority within fifteen days from release from prison and inform the Investigator\nabout the compliance. However, subject to the \nIndian Arms Act, 1959\n, the petitioner\nshall be entitled to renew and take it back in case of acquittal in this case, provided\notherwise permissible in the concerned rules. Restricting firearms would instill\nconfidence in the victim(s), their families, and society; it would also restrain the\naccused from influencing the witnesses and repeating the offense.\n\n16. The conditions mentioned above imposed by this court are to endeavor to\nreform and ensure the accused does not repeat the offense. \nIn \nMohammed Zubair v.\nState of NCT of Delhi\n, 2022:INSC:735 [Para 28], Writ Petition (Criminal) No 279 of 2022,\nPara 29, decided on July 20, 2022, A Three-Judge bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court\nholds that \"The bail conditions imposed by the Court must not only have a nexus to the\npurpose that they seek to serve but must also be proportional to the purpose of\nimposing them. The courts, while imposing bail conditions must balance the liberty of\nthe accused and the necessity of a fair trial. While doing so, conditions that would\nresult in the deprivation of rights and liberties must be eschewed.\"\n\n17. It is clarified that if the petitioner violates any bail condition, the State and/or\nthe victim may file an application for bail cancellation before the trial court, which shall\nbe competent to cancel the bail or add more conditions. Furthermore, if the petitioner\nmoves for deletion or dilution of any bail conditions, the trial court is empowered to do\nso.\n\n 4\n\n 4 of 5\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 20-02-2025 05:34:21 :::\n\n Neutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:024372\nCRM-M-51511-2024\n\n18. This bail is conditional, and the foundational condition is that if the petitioner\nindulges in any non-bailable offense, the State shall file an application for\ncancellation of this bail before the Sessions Court, which shall have the liberty to\ncancel this bail.\n\n19. The concerned trial court is authorized to delete, modify, or relax any of the\nabove conditions and shall be competent to do so in accordance with the law.\n\n20. Any observation made hereinabove is neither an expression of opinion on the\ncase's merits nor shall the trial Court advert to these comments.\n\n21. A certified copy of this order would not be needed for furnishing bonds, and\nany Advocate for the Petitioner can download this order along with case status from\nthe official web page of this Court and attest it to be a true copy. If the attesting officer\nwants to verify its authenticity, such an officer can also verify its authenticity and may\ndownload and use the downloaded copy for attesting bonds.\n\n22. Petition allowed in terms mentioned above. All pending applications, if any,\nstand disposed of.\n\n (ANOOP CHITKARA)\n JUDGE\nFebruary 19, 2025\nAK\n\nWhether speaking/reasoned : Yes\nWhether reportable : Yes\n\n 5\n\n 5 of 5\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 20-02-2025 05:34:21 :::",

Consequently, it would be\nappropriate to restrict the possession of firearm(s).

However, subject to the \nIndian Arms Act, 1959\n, the petitioner\nshall be entitled to renew and take it back in case of acquittal in this case, provided\notherwise permissible in the concerned rules.
