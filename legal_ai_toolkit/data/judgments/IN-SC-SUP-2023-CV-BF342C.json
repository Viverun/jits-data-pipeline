This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated\n\n20.12.2012 in Writ Appeal No. 268 of 2011 whereby, the Division Bench of\n\nthe High Court of Orissa has dismissed the intra-court appeal filed by the\n\nappellant State of Orissa and has affirmed the order dated 25.10.2010 in\n\nW.P. (C) No. 8438 of 2010, as passed by the learned Single Judge of the\n\nHigh Court, holding the employees of the Orissa Khadi and Village\n\nIndustries Board 1 entitled to pension at par with the Government\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nARJUN BISHT 1\n\nDate: 2023.03.17\n\n15:29:42 IST\n\nHereinafter also referred to as ‘the Board’.\n\nReason:\nemployees and also directing the State Government to amend the\n\napplicable regulations accordingly.\n\n2. In this appeal, the appellant State of Orissa has essentially\n\ncontended that the High Court was not justified in issuing directions\n\ncontrary to the applicable regulations, which rule out pensionary rights to\n\nthe employees of the Board in specific terms; and when the provisions\n\ncontained in the regulations were neither under challenge nor were\n\ndeclared invalid.\n\n3. While embarking upon the questions arising in this appeal, it shall\n\nbe apposite to take note of the relevant statutory provisions at the outset.\n\n3.1. The Orissa Khadi and Village Industries Board was established\n\nunder the Orissa Khadi and Village Industries Board Act, 19552 with the\n\naim and objective to organize, promote, develop, and regulate Khadi and\n\nVillage Industries throughout the State of Orissa.\n\n3.2. Section 3 of the Act of 1955 reads as under: -\n\n“3. Incorporation of the Board.- (1) The State Government with\neffect from such date as they may by notification appoint in this\nbehalf, shall establish for the purpose of this Act a Board to be called\nthe Orissa Khadi and Village Industries Board.\n\n(2) The Board established under Sub-section (1) shall be a body\ncorporate incorporated by its name with perpetual succession and\ncommon seal and may sue and be sued in its corporate name and\nshall be competent to acquire and hold and dispose of property both\n\n2 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Act of 1955’/’the Act’.\nmovable and immovable and to contract and do all things necessary\nfor the purposes of this Act.”\n\n3.3. Section 36 of the Act of 1955 stipulates that the Board may, with\n\nprevious sanction of the State Government, make regulations consistent\n\nwith the Act and the rules made thereunder to provide, inter alia, for the\n\nremuneration, allowances, and other conditions of service of the staff. It\n\nreads as under: -\n\n“36. Regulations.- (1) Subject to the provisions of Section 12\nthe Board may, with the previous sanction of the State Government\nby notification, make regulations consistent with this Act and rules\nmade thereunder.\n\n(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the\nforegoing power, the Board may make regulations providing for –\n\n(a) the procedure and disposal of its business;\n\n(b) remuneration, allowances and other conditions of service of\nthe staff of the Board;\n\n(c) functions and duties of the Staff of the Board;\n\n(d) functions of Committees and the procedure to be followed,\nby such Committees in the discharge of their functions.”\n\n3.4. In exercise of the powers so vested under Section 36 of the Act of\n\n1955, the Board has made the Orissa Khadi and Village Industries Board\n\nRegulations, 19603 providing for general conditions of service of its staff,\n\nremuneration, allowances, grant of leave, retirement benefits etc.\n\nRegulation 40 of the Regulations of 1960 reads as under: -\n\n“40. General conditions of service.- Unless otherwise provided in\nthese regulations, the rules in the Orissa Service Code, Volume I\nwith all its Appendices, except Appendices 1 to 4, 8 and 12, as\namended from time to time by the Government shall apply to the\n\n3 Hereinafter also referred to as ‘the Regulations of 1960’/’the Regulations’.\nemployees of the Board mutatis mutandis. For this purpose, the\nwords “Government”, “Government Servant” and “Head of\nDepartment” wherever they occur except in Chapter-I of the Code\nshall mean “the Board” “the employees of the Board” and “the\nPresident” respectively. “Superior Service” referred to in the Orissa\nService Code shall mean posts in Classes I, II and III and “Inferior\nService” shall mean posts in Class IV.”\n\nRegulation 52 of the Regulations of 1960, which is of direct\n\nrelevance in the present appeal, reads as under:\n\n“52. Retirement benefits.- The employees of the Board shall not\nbe entitled to any pension except the gratuity and the Contributory\nProvident Fund benefits admissible under these regulations.”\n\nRegulations 53 to 57 deal with the matters related to the\n\nContributory Provident Fund4, subscriptions, realization of subscriptions,\n\nand contributions etc.\n\n4. The factual aspects of the matter are not of much dispute. However,\n\na few background aspects and their salient features may be noticed,\n\nparticularly concerning the proposition for providing pension to the\n\nemployees of the Board and for amendment of the above-noticed\n\nRegulation 52 of the Regulations of 1960.\n\n4.1. It would appear that the proposition for providing pensionary rights\n\nto the employees of the Board had been a matter of several\n\ncommunications between the Board and the State Government and had\n\nalso been the subject of a few litigations in the past. Shorn of unnecessary\n\n4 ‘CPF’, for short.\ndetails, it could be noticed that from 06.10.1982 onwards, various\n\nproposals were mooted by the Board for providing pensionary benefits to\n\nits employees and requests were also made to the State Government to\n\namend the Regulations of 1960 in this regard. On 25.02.1985, the\n\nIndustries Department of the Government of Orissa sought for the views of\n\nthe Director of the Industries on the proposal to provide pension to the\n\nemployees of the Board and in response, on 31.10.1985, the Additional\n\nDirector of Industries, Government of Orissa opined that there should not\n\nbe any objection to allow the pensionary benefits to the employees of the\n\nBoard. Thereafter, on 18.12.1985, the Industries Department, Government\n\nof Orissa sought for certain information from the Board as regards the\n\nannual requirement of funds if pension was paid to the employees of the\n\nBoard and as to whether the amount required for payment of pension was\n\nmore or less in comparison to Employees’ Provident Fund5 amount as also\n\nthe details of the employees to be retired in the coming 5 years and the\n\namount required for payment of pension to them. This was followed by the\n\nletter dated 15.05.1990 from the President of the Board stating justification\n\nfor payment of pension to the Board’s employees. On 19.09.1991 and then,\n\non 08.10.1992, the Industries Department again sought for information\n\n5 ‘EPF’, for short.\nregarding functioning of the Board, its objectives and updated financial\n\nstatements as also the calculation of expenditure, if the pensionary benefits\n\nwere extended to the employees of the Board. In response to this, on\n\n18.12.1992, the Secretary of the Board furnished a reply to the State\n\nGovernment with justification for extending the pension scheme to the\n\nemployees of the Board.\n\n4.2. Pursuant to the aforementioned exchange of communications, on\n\n17.03.1993, the Handicraft and Cottage Industries Department of the\n\nGovernment of Orissa asked the Board to obtain written clearance from the\n\nEPF Commissioner that they will refund the amount and forward the reply\n\nso as to enable the Department to submit the proposal to the Finance\n\nDepartment. On 24.04.1993, the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner\n\nintimated to the Board that the proposal for refund would be considered\n\nonly as and when the proposed pension scheme was approved by the\n\nGovernment of Orissa. Thereafter, on 30.04.1993, the Board informed the\n\nHandicraft and Cottage Industries Department the total amount of\n\naccumulation, as indicated by the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner\n\nand requested to take up the matter with the Government and followed it\n\nup on 19.08.1993, with a request to the Department to expedite the matter.\n\nAgain on 29.09.1993, the Department sought for certain clarifications from\n\nthe Board and thereupon, on 25.07.1994, the Board informed that there will\nbe no extra financial burden on the Government if pension scheme was\n\nmade applicable to the employees of the Board.\n\n4.3. After the aforesaid communications, the Handicraft and Cottage\n\nIndustries Department, in its communication dated 26.10.1994, indicated\n\nthe anomalies which were likely to result if the pensionary benefits to the\n\nemployees of the Board were allowed with effect from 01.04.1976 and\n\nsuggested that Regulation 52 be suitably revised so that the date of\n\nimplementation of the pension scheme would be decided by the\n\nGovernment instead of the Board. The relevant part of this communication\n\nreads as under: -\n\n“I am directed to refer to your letter No. 10491 dated 25.07.1994 on\nthe above subject and to say that it has been proposed by the\nOrissa Khadi & VI Board (in regulation 52) to substitute every\nemployee who has retired on or after the 1 st day of April, 76 be\nentitled either to the benefit of pension schemes as applicable to\nthe State Government employees as amended from time to time or\nto the benefit of employees provident fund as he may opt. It is\nrelevant to point out that the Orissa Civil Service Pension Rules,\nand Orissa Civil Service Commutation of Pension Rules have come\ninto force with effect from 01.04.1992. Some of the provisions of\npension and commutation Rules, i.e. commutation of pension and\n50% of the last pay drawn, maximum limit of gratuity, revised rate\nof family pension, liberalized voluntary retirement schemes and the\nrevised procedure on medial examination in connection with\npension etc. were not in existence during the year 1976 and such\napplicability of pensionary benefits to the Board employees with\neffect from 01.04.1976 will create discrimination and confusion. As\nsuch, the regulation 52 may be suitably revised with approval of the\nOK & VI Board so that the date of implementation of the pension\nscheme will be decided by the Government instead of the Board.”\n\n4.4. Thereafter, on 06.10.1995, the Deputy Secretary, Handicraft and\n\nCottage Industries Department made a request to the Accountant General\n(A&E), Orissa to examine the proposal for introduction of pension scheme\n\nand to send his comments to the Finance Department, while stating that\n\nthere will be no extra financial burden on the Government if the pension\n\nscheme was made applicable to the Board’s employees with effect from\n\n01.04.1976.\n\n4.5. However, by way of the letter dated 31.07.1996, the Industries\n\nDepartment informed the Board that the proposal for introduction of\n\npension scheme for its employees had not been agreed to by the Finance\n\nDepartment for a variety of reasons, including that: (a) earlier, by the letter\n\ndated 18.12.1992, the pension scheme was proposed to be introduced with\n\neffect from 01.04.1985 but subsequently, the same was revised to be\n\neffective from 01.04.1976; (b) giving retrospective effect to pension\n\nscheme was rare and it would create administrative and financial\n\ncomplications in future; (c) the employees of the Board who had retired\n\nprior to 01.04.1976 will also claim pensionary benefits; and (d) all other\n\nCorporations/Institutions/Bodies of the State will agitate for pensionary\n\nbenefits retrospectively, which would land the Government in\n\nadministrative and financial trouble. The Board was, therefore, requested\n\nto re-examine the proposal in the light of the observations of Finance\n\nDepartment and to re-submit the same while keeping in view the factors\n\nconcerning the sources of finance and financial burden on the Government.\n4.6. In the aforementioned backdrop, some retired employees of the\n\nBoard filed a writ petition, being OJC No. 15344 of 1998, before the High\n\nCourt, which came to be disposed of by the order dated 06.02.2001,\n\nwhereby the High Court directed the Industries Department to take a\n\ndecision with regard to extension of pension scheme to the employees of\n\nthe Board.\n\n4.7. Thereafter, on 20.07.2001, the Board wrote a letter to the Industries\n\nDepartment giving justification for introducing the pension scheme in the\n\nmanner that the requirement of funds to meet the pensionary scheme will\n\nbe Rs. 1.83 crore; that by introduction of pensionary scheme, the\n\nGovernment will save Rs. 1.90 crore in the coming ten years; and that the\n\nretired employees were to refund a sum of Rs. 75.07 lakh towards EPF\n\namount if they come over to the pensionary scheme. However, on\n\n27.03.2002, the Industries Department intimated that the State\n\nGovernment had decided not to introduce the pensionary scheme for the\n\nemployees of the Board after taking into account the precarious financial\n\ncondition of the State.\n\n5. Aggrieved by the aforesaid communication dated 27.03.2002, the\n\nex-employees of the Board filed a writ petition before the High Court, being\n\nW.P. (C) No. 1951 of 2002. During the pendency of this writ petition, the\n\nexisting employees of the Board filed another writ petition, being W.P.(C)\nNo. 14729 of 2007, claiming pensionary benefits at par with other\n\norganizations of the State and the State Government employees.\n\n5.1. On 12.09.2008, the High Court disposed of W.P. (C) No. 1951 of\n\n2002 with the observations, inter alia, that the said petitioners having retired\n\nlong back and there being no provision for pension in their service\n\nconditions, no directions could be issued qua them for payment of any\n\npension. However, in view of the pendency of other writ petition, the High\n\nCourt provided that the claim of the said petitioners will be subject to the\n\nresult of the other writ petition filed by the employees who were in service.\n\n5.2. Thereafter, the said other writ petition, being W.P. (C) No. 14729 of\n\n2007, was disposed of by the High Court on 25.11.2008, with direction to\n\nthe appellant State to reconsider the matter and to take the decision\n\nexpeditiously. The High Court observed and directed as under: -\n\n“3. No Counter Affidavit has been filed by the State. Be that as it\nmay, it appears that the State Government has decided to introduce\nthe pension scheme but then refrained from doing so due to\nfinancial emergency. In view of the fact that six years have passed\nin the meanwhile and as pension is no more a bounty this Court\nfeels that ends of justice and equity will be better served if Opposite\nParty No. 1 is directed to reconsider the direction issued by this\nCourt in the earlier Writ Petition and take a decision as expeditiously\nas possible, preferably within a period of six months, from the date\nof communication of this order, and directs accordingly.”\n\n6. Even after re-examination of the matter pursuant to the directions\n\naforesaid, the Finance Department observed that the State Government\n\ncould not bear the liabilities in implementing the pension scheme for the\nemployees of the Board and this was communicated to the Board by the\n\nIndustries Department, by way of its letter dated 14.12.2009, in the\n\nfollowing terms: -\n\n“In inviting a reference to your letter No. 2128 dated 12.05.2009 on\nthe above subject, I am directed to say that after detail examination\nFinance Department have been pleased to observe that State\nGovernment cannot bear the liabilities in implementing a pension\nscheme for the OK & VI Board.”\n\n7. Dissatisfied with such a response, the writ petition leading to this\n\nappeal, being W.P. (C) No. 8438 of 2010, was filed by respondent No. 1\n\n(an association of the employees of the Board) on 04.05.2010 with the\n\nfollowing prayers: -\n\n“Under the circumstances, it is humbly requested that the Hon’ble\nCourt be pleased to issue a writ in the nature of mandamus or any\nother appropriate writ/writs quashing the letter dated 14.12.2009 as\nper Annexure – 17.\n\nAnd further be pleased to direct the Opposite Party No. 1 and 2 to\ngive previous sanction under\nSection 36(1)\nof the Khadi and Village\nIndustries Board Act, 1955 at an early date the Opposite Party\nNo. 2 make regulation under\nSection 36(2)\nof the said Act\nintroducing pension scheme as per the Resolution of the Orissa\nKhadi and Village Industries Board dated 10.02.2009.\nAnd further be pleased to direct the Opposite Parties to grant\npension to the Employees of Orissa Khadi and Village Industries\nBoard from the date of their respective retirement.\nOr pass appropriate direction(s) and order(s) as this Hon’ble Court\nthinks fit and proper.”\n\n7.1. A learned Single Judge of the High Court disposed of the writ\n\npetition so filed by respondent No. 1 by way of the impugned order dated\n\n25.10.2010, with directions to the State Government to amend the\n\nRegulations of 1960 and to take appropriate steps to incorporate the\npension scheme for the Board’s employees at par with the State\n\nGovernment employees. The learned Single Judge took note of the\n\nexchange of communications as above noticed and deduced that the State\n\nGovernment was desirous of extending the benefit to the Board’s\n\nemployees but, ultimately the proposition was rejected only on the ground\n\nthat the State Government could not bear the liabilities of pension scheme\n\nfor the Board. The learned Single Judge observed that if one benefit was\n\nextended to the counterpart employees, the same could not be denied to\n\nthe others and in this regard, took note of pensionary benefits extended to\n\nthe employees of a couple of Universities as also the Social Welfare\n\nAdvisory Board; and found that not introducing pension scheme in favour\n\nof the employees of the Board on the ground of financial stringencies,\n\nwhere similarly situated organisations were enjoying the benefits, was a\n\nmatter of sheer discrimination and as a result, violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. The learned Single Judge also observed\n\nthat the Board is a part and parcel of the State Government when all service\n\nrules of the State Government employees were adopted and, therefore, it\n\nwas a moral duty of the opposite parties to enact the provisions for\n\nproviding pensionary benefits to the employees of the Board. A reference\n\nwas also made to certain decisions relied upon on behalf of the employees\n\nwith regard to the pensionary benefits extended to the employees of\n\ndifferent Khadi and Village Industries Boards of other States and the\nlearned Single Judge observed that consistently, it was held by the Courts\n\nthat financial hardship was not at all a criterion or ground for depriving the\n\nemployees of the Board of service benefits, such as pension. With these\n\nobservations and analysis, the learned Single Judge proceeded to set\n\naside the impugned communication dated 14.12.2009 and issued\n\ndirections to the State Government in the following terms: -\n\n“17. As such the order dated 14.12.2009 vide Anenxure-12 is not\nsustainable and the same is quashed. In view of the aforesaid\nsubmission my considered opinion is that the Board employees are\nentitled to pension at par with the Government employees of the\nState and like other State Government organizations and for which\nthe State Government should amend the Orissa Khadi and Village\nIndustries Board Regulation by extending the pensionary benefit to\nthe employees of the Orissa Khadi and Village Industries and\naccordingly, the Opposite Party Nos. 1 and 2 are directed to take\nappropriate steps to incorporate pension scheme for the Board’s\nemployees at par with State Government employees. The entire\nexercise shall be completed within a period of three months from\nthe date of communication of this order.”\n\n8. In challenge to the order so passed by the learned Single Judge,\n\nthe appellant State preferred an intra-court appeal, being W.A. No. 268 of\n\n2011, which was decided by the impugned order dated 20.12.2012. The\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court observed that the direction of the learned\n\nSingle Judge was only advisory in nature and the same was in the welfare\n\nof the employees of the Board; and the State Government shall honour the\n\nsame while keeping in view the interest of the retired employees in terms\n\nof the mandate of\nArticle 41\nof the Directive Principles of State Policy by\n\ndischarging its constitutional obligations towards aged persons who have\nserved the State through the Board. The relevant parts of the impugned\n\norder dated 20.12.2012 could be usefully reproduced as under:\n\n“10. After hearing learned counsel for the respective parties, we\nhave examined the matter at length. Perusal of the different\nprovisions of the Act, 1955, Rule, 1956 and Regulation, 1960\nframed thereunder by the Government leaves no manner of doubt\nthat the real control, authority of the Board rests with the Industries\nDepartment of the Government, in other words the Board is under\nthe direct control of the State Government and is totally dependant\non the Government for running its administration and in carrying out\nits activities including finance. Notwithstanding the fact that the\nBoard is a statutory one and right from the commencement, the\nmanagement, the administration, the appointment, framing\nregulations, carrying on with its activities, formulations of policy are\nall controlled by the State Government. Furthermore, the\nemployees of the Board in question are governed and controlled by\nRules as are applicable to the State Government servants and the\nprovisions of the Odisha Service Code, which are applicable to the\nState Government servants, are also applicable to the employees\nof the Board. The Travelling Allowance Rules and Odisha Leave\nRules are also applicable to the employees of the Board. The\nfunction of the Board is well defined in\nSection 17\nof the Act, 1955.\nTo discharge such functions, programmes have been drawn by the\nBoard with the sanction of the State Government and therefore, the\nState Government has all pervasive control over the Board and got\npower to frame Rules under\nSection 35\nof the Act, 1955. It is true\nthat the Regulation 52 of the Regulation, 1960 provides that the\nemployees of the Board are not entitled to pensionary benefits but\nto overcome such a hurdle the Board have recommended to the\nGovernment for amending Regulation 52 and this Court also\ndirected the Government to consider such demand of pension to\nthe employees of the Board in OJC No.15344 of 1998 and W.P. (C)\nNo.14729 of 2007. But the State Government on the ground that it\ncannot take extra burden of providing pension to the employees of\nthe Board did not comply with the directions of this Court.\nAdmittedly, when all conditions of service of the State Government\nemployees are applicable to the Board employees, refusal to extend\nthe pensionary scheme to such employees of the Board, in our\nconsidered view, amounts to discrimination and violative of\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution of India. The learned Single Judge has\ndealt with the important aspect in detail in the impugned judgment.\n\nIt was brought to our notice that the Board on several occasions\nmoved the State Government through the Industries Department\nwhich is the controlling authority of the Board for extending\npensionary benefits to the employees of the Board, but the same\ndid not find favour with the Government on the ground that the State\nGovernment cannot carry the extra financial burden. In our opinion,\nthe view taken by the learned Single Judge with regard to making\nprovision for providing pension to the employees of the Board is\nquite justified and calls for no interference, as the same is in\nconformity with the decisions of Gujarat and Bombay High Courts\nin the cases referred to supra upon which learned Senior Counsel\nhas rightly placed reliance. For all practical purposes, the Board is\nan instrumentality of the State and therefore, it is covered under the\n\nArticle 12\nof the Constitution of India and undoubtedly amenable to\nthe writ jurisdiction of this Court. We are quite aware of our\nlimitations under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution. The direction of the\nlearned Single Judge to Opposite Party Nos.1 and 2 to take\nappropriate steps to incorporate the pension scheme for the\nemployees of the Board at par with the State Government\nemployees is only advisory in nature and the same is in the welfare\nof the employees of the Board. The State Government shall honour\nsuch advisory note keeping in view that the interest of the retired\nemployees shall be taken care of by the State Government as\nmandated under\nArticle 41\nof the directive principles of the State\npolicy by discharging its constitutional obligations towards aged\npersons who have served the State through Board, as the State has\ndecentralized its power and functions through its instrumentalities\nsuch as the Board and other statutory Corporation for good\ngovernance of the people under the Constitution of India.\n\n11. In the result, after making a threadbare analysis and appraisal\nof factual and legal profile and proposition highlighted before us, we\nfind no merit in this writ appeal and the impugned order of the\nlearned Single Judge does not call for any interference in any\nmanner.\n\nAccordingly, the writ appeal stands dismissed.”\n\n9. The appellant State of Orissa is aggrieved by the orders so passed\n\nby the High Court. Before proceeding further, it may be noticed that while\n\nentertaining the petition seeking leave to appeal in this matter,\n\non 11.04.2014, this Court stayed the operation of the impugned judgment\n\nand order of the High Court; and on 07.09.2015, while granting leave to\nappeal, the interim order dated 11.04.2014 was continued. The same\n\nposition has continued hitherto.\n\n10. While questioning the impugned orders and the directions issued\n\nthereunder, learned counsel for the appellant State, after an elaborate\n\nreference to the provisions of the Act of 1955 and the Regulations of 1960\n\nas also the exchange of communications, has submitted that the impugned\n\norders remain unsustainable in law and deserve to be set aside.\n\n10.1. Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that no direction\n\ncontrary to Regulation 52 of the Regulations of 1960 could have been\n\nissued, particularly when the said Regulation 52 was neither a subject-\n\nmatter of challenge before the High Court nor was declared invalid in any\n\nproceedings. Learned counsel has yet further submitted that the directions\n\nof the learned Single Judge, as approved by the Division Bench, without\n\ndeliberating on Regulation 52 as also the other provisions in the\n\nRegulations of 1960 including those contained in Regulations 53 to 56,\n\nremain wholly unjustified and cannot be approved.\n\n10.2. Learned counsel would submit that the prayers based on certain\n\ncommunications exchanged between the Board and the State Government\n\ncould not have been countenanced at the instance of the employees, who\n\nhad joined the services with the Board while being conscious of the\n\nstipulations in the Regulations and thereby, the conditions of their service.\n\nLearned counsel has submitted that even when relying on the resolutions\nadopted by the Board and the exchange of communications, the learned\n\nSingle Judge has failed to consider that at no point of time, the State ever\n\nacceded to the proposal of the Board; and certain suggestions made by\n\nsome of the officers of the Government at different levels could not have\n\nbeen taken in aid to direct the appellants to amend the said Regulation 52.\n\nLearned counsel has further submitted that the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt, although consciously took note of the stipulations of Regulation 52\n\nand observed that the directions of the learned Single Judge were only\n\nadvisory in nature but then, proceeded to make further observations, which\n\nare practically of issuing mandamus to the State Government to amend the\n\nRegulations. These directions, according to the learned counsel, enter into\n\nthe arena of policy decisions and legislative functions; and the High Court\n\nhas not been justified in issuing the same.\n\n10.3. Learned counsel has further submitted that the learned Single\n\nJudge has referred to the pension granted to the employees of the State\n\nSocial Advisory Board but, has failed to notice that 50% of those expenses\n\nwere borne by the Government of India. Further, the employees of the\n\nUniversity and the employees of the Board do not form a homogenous\n\nclass and cannot be treated at par, especially when the Regulations of\n\n1960 carry statutory force and Regulation 52 therein cannot be ignored.\n\n10.4. Learned counsel for the appellant has also submitted that any\n\nreference to the provisions contained in relation to different State Boards\nremain inapposite because any prescription by any other State cannot be\n\nipso facto imposed on the appellant State. According to the learned\n\ncounsel, contrary to the suggestions of the writ petitioners, there are many\n\nother State Boards in the country who have not granted pensionary benefits\n\nto their employees.\n\n10.5. It is also submitted that the writ petition by the retired employees of\n\nthe Board seeking pension after having withdrawn the amount from their\n\nCPF/EPF account was liable to be dismissed and hence, the impugned\n\norders deserve to be set aside.\n\n11. Per contra, learned senior counsel for respondent No. 1 has duly\n\nsupported the orders impugned and has made a variety of submissions\n\nwhich could be summarised as follows:\n\n11.1. Learned senior counsel has referred to the provisions contained in\n\nthe Act of 1955 and has submitted that respondent No. 2 is a statutory\n\nBoard with the State Government exercising absolute control over its affairs\n\nincluding budgetary control; and by virtue of powers under Section 36, the\n\nRegulations of 1960 were framed. In terms of Regulation 40, the rules in\n\nthe Orissa Service Code, Volume I apply mutatis mutandis to the\n\nemployees of the Board, meaning thereby that the employees of the Board\n\nwere and are treated at par with State Government employees but,\n\nRegulation 52, which provides for gratuity and contributory provident fund\nbenefits, unjustifiably denies pensionary benefits to the employees of the\n\nBoard.\n\n11.2. Learned senior counsel for respondent No. 1 has referred to the\n\naforementioned exchange of communications and has submitted that in the\n\ngiven set of circumstances and in the wake of repeated representations,\n\nthe Board, in all earnestness, took up the cause for grant of pension to its\n\nemployees and also requested the Government to bring about appropriate\n\namendments in view of the powers under Section 36 so that Regulation 52\n\ncould be amended to include pension, particularly when Regulation 40 did\n\nequate the employees of the Board at par with the State Government\n\nemployees. Learned senior counsel has strenuously argued that the State\n\nGovernment, while in principle agreeing to grant of pensionary benefits by\n\nthe letter dated 26.10.1994, cited only a specious plea of financial\n\nstringency for denying such pensionary benefits to the employees of the\n\nBoard which could not have been countenanced. According to the learned\n\ncounsel, the writ petition filed by the employees on the grounds of hostile\n\ndiscrimination and non-consideration of representation was rightly decided\n\nby the learned Single Judge with directions to the State Government to\n\namend the Regulations so as to extend the pensionary benefits to the\n\nemployees of the Board at par with the employees of the State\n\nGovernment. Further, the Division Bench of the High Court, while affirming\n\nthe ultimate conclusion of the learned Single Judge, rightly observed that\nthe State Government, while following\nArticle 41\nof the Directive Principles\n\nof State Policy, should honour the advice given by the Single Judge, by\n\nincorporating the pension scheme for the employees of the Board.\n\n11.3. Learned senior counsel has vehemently argued that financial\n\nstringency cannot be a reason for denying pensionary benefits to the\n\nemployees with reference to the decisions of this Court, including that in\n\nHaryana State Minor Irrigation Tubewells Corporation and Ors. v. G.S.\n\nUppal and Ors.\n: (2008) 7 SCC 375, where, in paragraphs 33 and 34, this\n\nCourt held that the High Court was right in rejecting the plea of the\n\nCorporation about inability to revise the pay scales of the employees on\n\naccount of the financial burden on the Corporation.\n\nThe learned counsel\n\nhas also referred to the decision of this Court in\nPunjab State Cooperative\n\nAgricultural Development Bank Ltd. v. Registrar, Cooperative\n\nSocieties and Ors.\n: (2022) 4 SCC 363. It has further been submitted that\n\nother Departments of the State, as noticed by the High Court, have been\n\ngranted pensionary benefits where the cadre strength is much larger and\n\nhence, any reference to financial stringency is nothing but a bogey\n\nargument of the State Government.\n\n11.4. Learned senior counsel for respondent No. 1 has further argued,\n\nwith reference to the decisions of this Court in D.S. Nakara and Ors. v.\n\nUnion of India: (\n1983) 1 SCC 305 and State of Jharkhand and Ors. v.\n\nJitendra Kumar Srivastava and Anr.\n: (2013) 12 SCC 210, that pension\nis neither a bounty nor is it a matter of grace, but is a claimable right.\n\nTherefore, feeble reasons such as financial constraints cannot be\n\nconsidered good enough for not extending pensionary benefits to retired\n\nemployees, who are anyways treated at par with the State Government\n\nemployees for other purposes.\n\nRather, the denial of such pensionary rights\n\namounts to hostile discrimination between two sets of employees who are\n\notherwise similarly circumstanced, and remains impermissible, as held by\n\nthis Court in the case of\nAir India v. Nergesh Meerza and Ors.\n: (1981) 4\n\nSCC 335.\n\n11.5. It has also been submitted that there were 383 employees (past and\n\npresent) eligible for pension with effect from 01.04.1976, out of which,\n\nbetween the year 1976 to the month of May, 2022, 140 employees have\n\ndied; at present, the existing posts are only 210 as the Government has\n\nabolished 173 posts; and the existing staff strength is only 58 because no\n\nappointment has been made since the year 1996. It has, thus, been\n\ncontended that while the State Government employees, who are huge in\n\nnumber, are entitled to pension, denial of the same to a miniscule number\n\nof the Board employees (who are otherwise treated at par with State\n\nGovernment employees), on the ground of financial stringency does not\n\nbehove well of a model employer like the State of Orissa, which is one of\n\nthe few financially strong States within the Union of India.\n11.6. Learned senior counsel has further submitted that in similar\n\ncircumstances, a Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court, by the judgment\n\ndated 23.07.2004 in the case of\nGujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Board\n\nv. Gujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Pensioners Association\n: 2004 SCC\n\nOnLine Guj 105, allowed the grant of pensionary benefits to the employees\n\nof Gujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Board; and the said judgement was not\n\ninterfered with by this Court in SLP (Civil) CC No.1321- 1482 of 2005,\n\nwhich also persuaded the High Court of Orissa to grant similar reliefs by\n\nthe impugned orders and in the given set of facts, the impugned orders\n\nwould call for no interference.\n\n11.7. Further, it has been submitted on behalf of respondent No. 1 that in\n\nvery many cases, the employees who were drawing or contributing, or had\n\nwithdrawn the CPF after retirement, were given the liberty of refunding such\n\namount with interest as was determined in this Court for grant of pension;\n\nand with reference to the decision in the case of\nUniversity of Delhi v.\n\nShashi Kiran and Ors.\n: 2022 SCC OnLine SC 594, it has been contended\n\nthat similar treatment may be provided in relation to the employees of the\n\nBoard for grant of pensionary benefits.\n\n11.8. In the last, learned senior counsel has made a fervent plea that the\n\ncase of the employees concerned may be sympathetically considered by\n\nthis Court and for that matter, by using extraordinary powers under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, to render complete justice, this Court may call upon\nthe State Government to facilitate grant of pension by recommending the\n\namendment of Regulation 52 so that the employees, who have toiled on\n\nbehalf of the Board representing the State Government, would have a\n\nsecured retired life.\n\n12. Learned counsel appearing for respondent No. 2, the Board, has\n\nduly supported the claim made by the employees for pensionary benefits\n\nand has opposed this appeal with a few additional submissions.\n\n12.1. Learned counsel for the Board would submit that promotion of khadi\n\nand cottage industries being the constitutional obligation of the State in\n\nterms of\nArticle 43\nof the Constitution of India, the appellant State has\n\nenacted the Act of 1955 and has established the Board. This being\n\nessentially State endeavour, the parity claimed by the employees of the\n\nBoard with their counterparts in State services could not have been denied.\n\n12.2. It has also been submitted that there are two type of employees in\n\nthe Board, one being those who have been recruited by the Board and the\n\nothers being those who come on deputation to the Board for a particular\n\nperiod of time. While the deputationists who come from State Government\n\nare entitled to pension and pension related benefits, the employees who\n\nare recruited by the Board have been deprived of the same even though\n\nessentially, they are discharging the State functions, as enshrined in\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India.\n12.3. It has further been submitted that not only the deputationists but\n\neven the employees of the Board are governed by the rules applicable to\n\nthe State Government employees like Service Code, Financial Rules,\n\nRecord Manual, Pay Scale Rules, Leave Rules, Reservation Rules,\n\nConduct and Discipline Rules etc. Thus, when all other rules applicable to\n\nthe State Government employees are applicable to the employees of the\n\nBoard, it is rather unjust and violative of the principles of fairness envisaged\n\nby\nArticle 14\nto deny pension to such employees in terms of the Orissa\n\nGovernment Pension Rules.\n\n12.4. According to the learned counsel, the High Court has rightly drawn\n\nanalogy from Khadi Boards of different States as also from other Orissa\n\nGovernment institutions, where the employees are entitled to pension; and\n\nthe direction for granting pension to the employees of the Board is neither\n\nunjust nor unreasonable nor unfair.\n\n12.5. Learned counsel for the Board has again referred to the statistics\n\nto submit that only a small number of employees are to be benefitted by\n\ngrant of pension in the present case and that the Board employees are\n\nessentially appointed in Group B and Group C posts. Thus, the pension in\n\ntheir relation would not be of an astronomical figure; and, the contention of\n\nalibi based on lack of financial resources deserves to be rejected.\n\n12.6. As regards the question of challenge to the provision by virtue of\n\nwhich pension has been denied to the employees of the Board, it has been\nargued that the employees of the Board have been fighting for grant of\n\npension for a long period of time and the instant litigation is not the first\n\nround of litigation. The very fact of demanding pension on the part of these\n\nemployees in itself is a direct challenge to the provision denying pension to\n\nthem; and in the backdrop of the present case, it cannot be construed that\n\nthe employees of the Orissa Khadi Board have not raised a direct grievance\n\nagainst the provision denying pension to them.\n\n12.7. Learned counsel for the Board has reiterated the plea that in this\n\nmatter of grant of pension to employees who are direct State functionaries\n\nin terms of\nArticle 43\nof the Constitution of India, a broad view is required\n\nto be taken and the grievance cannot be stiffened on a narrow technicality.\n\nIt has, thus, been submitted that in the broader interest of justice and for\n\ndoing complete justice, this Court could invoke\nArticle 142\nof the\n\nConstitution of India to maintain the direction for grant of pension to the\n\nemployees concerned.\n\n13. We have given anxious considerations to the rival submissions and\n\nhave examined the record with reference to the law applicable.\n\n14. It may be observed in the first place that the principles enunciated\n\nin the decisions cited by the learned counsel for respondents, that pension\n\nis neither a charity nor a bounty nor a gratuitous payment but, is earned for\n\npast services rendered; and that non-availability of financial resources\n\ncannot be a defence by the Government or any of its agencies or\ninstrumentalities in taking away vested right accrued to the employees, are\n\nneither of any doubt nor of any dispute. However, while adverting to the\n\nquestion about applicability of these principles to the case at hand, we may\n\nexamine the relevant observations and expositions in the cited decisions\n\nas infra.\n\n14.1.\nIn\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra), this Court reaffirmed the principles that\n\npension is not a bounty or a matter of grace depending on the sweet will of\n\nthe employer as also that pension is not an ex gratia payment and is a\n\nsocial welfare measure rendering socio-economic justice. In the referred\n\npassages, this Court observed and exposited as under: -\n\n“20. The antequated notion of pension being a bounty, a gratuitous\npayment depending upon the sweet will or grace of the employer\nnot claimable as a right and, therefore, no right to pension can be\nenforced through Court has been swept under the carpet by the\ndecision of the Constitution Bench in\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State\nof Bihar\n[(1971) 2 SCC 330] wherein this Court authoritatively ruled\nthat pension is a right and the payment of it does not depend upon\nthe discretion of the Government but is governed by the rules and\na government servant coming within those rules is entitled to claim\npension. It was further held that the grant of pension does not\ndepend upon anyone's discretion. It is only for the purpose of\nquantifying the amount having regard to service and other allied\nmatters that it may be necessary for the authority to pass an order\nto that effect but the right to receive pension flows to the officer not\nbecause of any such order but by virtue of the rules.\n\nThis view was\nreaffirmed in\nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n. [(1976) 2 SCC 1]\n***** ***** *****\n\n30. The discernible purpose thus underlying pension scheme or a\nstatute introducing the pension scheme must inform interpretative\nprocess and accordingly it should receive a liberal construction and\nthe courts may not so interpret such statute as to render them inane\n(see American Jurisprudence, 2d, 881).\n\n31. From the discussion three things emerge: (i) that pension is\nneither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the sweet\nwill of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to 1972\nRules which are statutory in character because they are enacted in\nexercise of powers conferred by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nand\nclause (5) of\nArticle 148\nof the Constitution; (ii) that the pension is\nnot an ex gratia payment but it is a payment for the past service\nrendered; and (iii) it is a social welfare measure rendering socio-\n\neconomic justice to those who in the hey-day of their life ceaselessly\ntoiled for the employer on an assurance that in their old age they\nwould not be left in lurch. It must also be noticed that the quantum\nof pension is a certain percentage correlated to the average\nemoluments drawn during last three years of service reduced to 10\nmonths under liberalised pension scheme. Its payment is\ndependent upon an additional condition of impeccable behaviour\neven subsequent to retirement, that is, since the cessation of the\ncontract of service and that it can be reduced or withdrawn as a\ndisciplinary measure.”\n\n14.2.\nIn the case of\nJitendra Kumar Srivastava\n(supra), this Court\n\nreaffirmed that pension is not a bounty but is a hard earned benefit which\n\naccrues to an employee and is in the nature of property, which cannot be\n\ntaken away without the due process of law.\n\nThis Court pronounced against\n\ndenial of right of the petitioner to receive pension and, with reference to the\n\nConstitution Bench decision in\nDeokinandan Prasad v. State of Bihar\n:\n\n(1971) 2 SCC 330 as also with reference to\nD.S. Nakara\n(supra), said as\n\nunder:-\n\n“8. It is an accepted position that gratuity and pension are not\nbounties. An employee earns these benefits by dint of his long,\ncontinuous, faithful and unblemished service. Conceptually it is so\nlucidly described in\nD.S. Nakara v. Union of India\n[(1983) 1 SCC\n305…..\n\n……It is thus a hard earned benefit which accrues to an employee\nand is in the nature of “property”. This right to property cannot be\ntaken away without the due process of law as per the provisions of\n\nArticle 300-A\nof the Constitution of India.”\n14.3.\nIn the case of\nHaryana State Minor Irrigation Tubewells\n\nCorporation\n(supra), this Court disapproved the denial of revised pay\n\nscale to the employees on the specious grounds of financial constraints\n\nand said as under: -\n\n“33. The plea of the appellants that the Corporation is running under\nlosses and it cannot meet the financial burden on account of\nrevision of scales of pay has been rejected by the High Court and,\nin our view, rightly so. Whatever may be the factual position, there\nappears to be no basis for the action of the appellants in denying\nthe claim of revision of pay scales to the respondents. If the\nGovernment feels that the Corporation is running into losses,\nmeasures of economy, avoidance of frequent writing off of dues,\nreduction of posts or repatriating deputationists may provide the\npossible solution to the problem. Be that as it may, such a\ncontention may not be available to the appellants in the light of the\nprinciple enunciated by this Court in\nM.M.R. Khan v. Union of\nIndia\n[1990\nSupp SCC 191] and Indian Overseas Bank v. Staff\nCanteen Workers' Union\n[(2000) 4 SCC 245] . However, so long as\nthe posts do exist and are manned, there appears to be no\njustification for granting the respondents a scale of pay lower than\nthat sanctioned for those employees who are brought on\ndeputation. In fact, the sequence of events discussed above clearly\nshows that the employees of the Corporation have been treated on\na par with those in Government at the time of revision of scales of\npay on every occasion.\n\n34. It is an admitted position that the scales of pay were initially\nrevised w.e.f. 1-4-1979 and thereafter on 1-1-1986. On both these\noccasions, the pay scales of the employees of the Corporation were\ntreated and equated on a par with those in Government. It is thus\nan established fact that both were similarly situated. Thereafter,\nnothing appears to have happened which may justify the differential\ntreatment. Thus, the Corporation cannot put forth financial loss as\na ground only with regard to a limited category of employees. It\ncannot be said that the Corporation is financially sound insofar as\ngranting of revised pay scales to other employees is concerned, but\nfinds financial constraints only when it comes to dealing with the\nrespondents who are similarly placed in the same category….”\n\n14.4.\nIn the case of\nPunjab State Cooperative Agricultural\n\nDevelopment Bank Ltd.\n(supra), this Court held that non-availability of\nfinancial resources could not be a defence by an agency or instrumentality\n\nof the Government in taking away vested right accrued to the employees.\n\nThis Court said as follows: -\n\n“57. In our view, non-availability of financial resources would not be\na defence available to the appellant Bank in taking away the vested\nrights accrued to the employees that too when it is for their socio-\neconomic security. It is an assurance that in their old age, their\nperiodical payment towards pension shall remain assured. The\npension which is being paid to them is not a bounty and it is for the\nappellant to divert the resources from where the funds can be made\navailable to fulfil the rights of the employees in protecting the vested\nrights accrued in their favour.”\n\n15. A close look at the decisions aforesaid makes it clear that the\n\nprinciples therein, though hardly requiring reiteration, are not of any\n\napplication to the present case.\n\n15.1. It is evident that in all such cases where this Court frowned upon\n\ndenial of pension, the right to receive the same was found flowing from the\n\napplicable rules and the service conditions. The said decisions cannot be\n\nweighed to mean that pension is required to be granted as a matter of right\n\neven if prescription to the contrary is found in the rules and/or service\n\nconditions.\n\n15.2. In the present case, it remains indisputable that the Regulations of\n\n1960 governing the service conditions of the employees of the Board\n\nspecifically contain the stipulation in Regulation 52 that they shall not be\n\nentitled to pension. The cited decisions on behalf of the respondents cannot\n\nbe read as overriding the said Regulation 52.\n15.3. So far as the questions relating to financial constraints are\n\nconcerned, true it is that in the communications exchanged between the\n\nBoard and the Government as also in the decisions communicated,\n\nfinancial constraints had also been indicated on behalf of the State\n\nGovernment as being one of the reasons for not acceding to the request\n\nfor retrospective amendment of Regulation 52. The question is as to\n\nwhether the Government could not have at all referred to the financial\n\nconstraints as one of the reasons for not acceding to such a prayer for\n\namendment.\n\n15.4. In our view, a reference to financial constraints by the Government\n\nwhile denying the prayer for retrospective amendment of Regulation 52\n\ncannot be disapproved with reference to the decisions aforesaid. A matter\n\nof denial of the revised pay scale to the employees who were otherwise\n\ntreated at par with those with the Government employees at the time of\n\nrevision of pay scale (as in the\nHaryana\ncase, supra); or taking away\n\nvested rights accrued to the employees (as in the\nPunjab\ncase, supra),\n\ncannot be imported to the present case where the Government has not\n\nfound itself agreeable to the proposed alteration of the service conditions\n\nof the Board’s employees with retrospective effect, i.e., with effect from\n\n01.04.1976. It has not been a case of denial of any vested or accrued right\n\nof the employees of the Board.\n16.\nIn the given set of facts and circumstances, the decision of this\n\nCourt in the case of\nAir India\n(supra), reaffirming the principles against\n\nhostile discrimination is also of no assistance to the respondents because\n\nwhat\nArticle 14\nforbids is hostile discrimination but not reasonable\n\nclassification.\n\nIn the referred passage in the case of\nAir India\n(supra), this\n\nCourt re-emphasised the principles against hostile discrimination but, at the\n\nsame time, underscored the principles of reasonable classification while\n\nobserving as under:\n\n“39….\n\n“(1)…..\n\n(2)\nArticle 14\nforbids hostile discrimination but not reasonable\nclassification. Thus, where persons belonging to a particular\nclass in view of their special attributes, qualities, mode of\nrecruitment and the like, are differently treated in public\ninterest to advance and boost members belonging to\nbackward classes, such a classification would not amount to\ndiscrimination having a close nexus with the objects sought to\nbe achieved so that in such cases\nArticle 14\nwill be completely\nout of the way.\n\n(3)\nArticle 14\ncertainly applies where equals are treated\ndifferently without any reasonable basis.\n\n(4) Where equals and unequals are treated differently,\nArticle\nwould have no application.\n\n(5) Even if there be one class of service having several\ncategories with different attributes and incidents, such a\ncategory becomes a separate class by itself and no difference\nor discrimination between such category and the general\nmembers of the other class would amount to any\ndiscrimination or to denial of equality of opportunity.\n(6) In order to judge whether a separate category has been\ncarved out of a class of service, the following circumstances\nhave generally to be examined:\n\n(a) the nature, the mode and the manner of recruitment of\na particular category from the very start,\n\n(b) the classifications of the particular category,\n(c) the terms and conditions of service of the members of\nthe category,\n\n(d) the nature and character of the posts and promotional\navenues,\n\n(e) the special attributes that the particular category\npossess which are not to be found in other classes, and\nthe like.””\n\n16.1. The observations in the impugned judgment and order dated\n\n20.12.2012 as also the contentions urged on behalf of the respondents,\n\nseeking to put the employees of the Board at par with the employees of the\n\nState Government for all purposes, carry their own shortcomings. Even if\n\nOrissa Khadi and Village Industries Board has been established under an\n\nenactment of the State and for several relevant factors, it could be\n\nconsidered to be an instrumentality of the State, its distinct characteristic\n\nof being a Board established with particular aim and objective cannot be\n\nignored altogether. The Board being a body corporate, incorporated by its\n\nname, has been established to carry out the purposes of the Act of 1955\n\nand not beyond. In view of its independent corporate entity and existence,\n\nthe provisions have been made in the Act of 1955 for making regulations\n\nby the Board consistent with the Act of 1955 and rules made thereunder\n\nwith the previous sanction of the State Government, where the Regulations\n\ncould provide, inter alia, for remuneration, allowances and other conditions\n\nof service of the staff of the Board (vide\nSection 36\nof the Act). The\n\nRegulations of 1960 were framed accordingly. Therein, even while\n\notherwise applying a substantial part of the Rules in the Orissa Service\nCode mutatis mutandis to the employees of the Board, Regulation 40 itself\n\nstarts with a clause of exception, making that provision subject to the other\n\nprovisions of the Regulations. Then, in Regulation 52 it has specifically\n\nbeen provided that the employees of the Board shall not be entitled to any\n\npension except gratuity and CPF benefits; and further provisions have\n\nbeen made for the purpose of subscription/contribution to CPF. Thus, even\n\nwhen the State has established the Board to carry out its obligations in\n\nterms of\nArticle 43\nof the Constitution of India, it cannot follow as a corollary\n\nthat the employees of this body corporate have to be treated as State\n\nGovernment employees in all respects. Such a corollary proposition would\n\npractically amount to merging of the Board with the State Government;\n\nrather making it as one of the Departments of the Government. This, in the\n\nface of existing statute, cannot be done. That being the position and when\n\nRegulations in question specifically make a distinct provision as regards\n\nretiral benefits, the same cannot be ignored by any stretch of arguments.\n\n16.1.1. Putting it differently, even if development of khadi and cottage\n\nindustry is a Directive Principle of State Policy, it does not follow as a\n\ncorollary that if the State establishes a Board or any organisation to carry\n\nout the obligations under such Directive Principles, it cannot make separate\n\narrangements as regards the service conditions of the employees of such\n\na Board or organisation. Significantly, Regulation 40 of the Regulations of\n1960 starts with an exception clause and while general conditions of\n\nservice of the Board’s employees have been provided in terms of the\n\nservice conditions of the employees of the State Government, the provision\n\nis subject to the other provisions of the Regulations. Hence, the other\n\nprovision, that is the one contained in Regulation 52, cannot be ignored.\n\n16.2. In regard to the submissions made on behalf of the State that the\n\naforesaid existing Regulation 52 had neither been challenged nor declared\n\ninvalid, it has been suggested on behalf of the respondents that when the\n\nemployees had regularly been raising the demand for pension by way of\n\nrepresentations and had taken up litigation too, challenge to the contrary\n\nprovisions is inherent in their demands/prayers. These submissions have\n\nonly been noted to be rejected for more than one reason. First, that merely\n\nmaking a prayer contrary to the existing provision in the statute does not\n\ncarry in itself a challenge to the provision. Secondly, for challenging a\n\nparticular provision, specific case is required to be made out of either want\n\nof statutory powers or of violation of any constitutional mandate. Neither\n\nany such ground of challenge had been urged nor could be assumed.\n\nThirdly, it is ex facie evident that all through the prayer had been for\n\namendment of Regulation 52 and not of declaring the same in its existing\n\nframe as being invalid. A prayer for amendment of the Regulation cannot\n\nbe equated with a prayer to declare the same as invalid. As noticed\n\nhereinbefore, the State Government’s denial of the proposed alteration was\nessentially based on its disagreement to alter the service conditions with\n\neffect from 01.04.1976. Viewed from any angle, invocation of the principles\n\nforbidding hostile discrimination remains baseless and the contentions\n\nurged on that basis are required to be rejected.\n\n17. On behalf of respondents, strong reliance has also been placed on\n\nthe decision of the Gujarat High Court in the case of\nGujarat State Khadi\n\nGramodyog Board\n(supra), while pointing out that this Court did not\n\ninterfere with the same and rejected the petition seeking leave to appeal. It\n\nhas been argued on the basis of this decision that the pension rights having\n\nbeen allowed to the employees of the similar Board in the State of Gujarat,\n\nthere is every reason to endorse the same treatment for the employees of\n\nthe respondent Board. The submissions do not take the case of the\n\nemployees of the respondent Board any further. This is for the simple but\n\npertinent reason flowing from a marked difference of the service conditions.\n\nThe High Court noticed in paragraph 14 of the referred judgment that\n\npension scheme in relation to employees of that Board was made\n\napplicable with effect from 12.11.1973; and those who were members of\n\nthe contributory provident fund were also made eligible for the pension\n\nscheme. In paragraph 14, the High Court noticed, inter alia, as under: -\n\n“14. For all practical purposes, respondent no. 1-Board is an\ninstrumentality of the State and, therefore, it is covered under\nArticle\nand undoubtedly amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nSince 1973 in the set-up of respondent no. 1, pension scheme was\nintroduced and was made applicable from 12.11.1973, and who\nwere the members of the Contributory Provident Fund (CPF), they\nwere made eligible for the pension scheme. It is, also, corroborated\nand supported and reinforced by the Resolution dated 06.11.87. It\nis, therefore, clear that the petitioners, who were employees of the\nrespondent No. 1-Board, and who have retired after 1.1.86 were\nalso entitled to pensionary benefits. The respondent No. 1-Board,\nundoubtedly, has been paying pension to the employees, those who\nhave retired from service of the Board, got pensionary benefits but\nnot in terms of the recommendations made by the 5th Pay\nCommission report until 31.12.1995. As a result of which, the\npension which was being paid to the petitioners, were due and\npayable, prior to the recommendations of the 5th Pay Commission\nand it continued. However, the effect of the recommendations made\nby the 5th Pay Commission report, accepted by the State and\ndespite that the respondent no. 2-State, as well as, the respondent\nNo. 1-Board, have not been given.\nIn other words, the pensionary\nbenefits which were available under the pension scheme, which\nwere not revised in terms of the 5th Pay Commission report, though\naccepted and adopted by the respondents authorities, have not\nbeen paid so far.”\n\n17.1. Thus, in the said case, pension scheme had already been\n\nintroduced and was made applicable from 12.11.1973; and the employees\n\nwho were the members of CPF, were made eligible for the pension\n\nscheme. In fact, the question therein was as to whether the employees of\n\nthe Gujarat State Khadi Gramodyog Board, who had retired prior to\n\n01.01.1996, were entitled to the payment of pension according to the\n\nrevised pay scale as per the recommendations of the 5th Pay Commission\n\nReport. The observations in\nthe said decision\ncannot be applied to issue a\n\nwrit of mandamus to the appellant State to amend the Regulations and to\n\nchange the service conditions.\n\n18. In view of the foregoing, it follows that the cited decisions are of no\n\nassistance to the claim of the respondents.\n19. The other factor indicated on behalf of the respondents that a small\n\nnumber of affected employees may not bring about much financial burden\n\non the State hardly make out a case for issuing a mandamus to the State\n\nto amend the Regulations. Whether to amend the Regulations or not, in the\n\nscheme of Act of 1955 as also the Regulations of 1960, is required to be\n\nleft to the State and for that matter, the number of employees to be\n\naffected/benefitted is not of much relevance. In this regard too, as noticed\n\nhereinbefore, apparently the objections of the State were against\n\nretrospective amendment of the Regulations and thereby allowing pension\n\nwith effect from 01.04.1976. Moreover, the indications in the referred\n\ncommunications that such a prescription is likely to bring about a huge\n\namount of administrative trouble to the Government cannot be dubbed as\n\nmere pretence or a bogus alibi. We would hasten to observe that\n\nirrespective of these observations and irrespective of the result of this\n\nlitigation, nothing would prevent the State Government to carry out the\n\namendment in the form suggested or in any other modified form, if the State\n\nGovernment would be willing to do so. The only question in the present\n\nappeal is as to whether a mandamus could have been issued to the State\n\nto carry out amendment. As noticed, the answer could only be in the\n\nnegative.\n20. The other submission made on behalf of the respondents as\n\nregards refund of amount with interest in case of grant of pensionary rights\n\ndoes not make out any case in favour of the employees of the Board. As\n\nobserved hereinabove, writ of mandamus cannot be issued to the appellant\n\nState to carry out amendments as desired by the respondent. Hence, the\n\nquestion of refund of the amount received by the employees concerned\n\ndoes not arise in this case.\n\n21. For what has been discussed hereinabove, we are clearly of the\n\nview that the direction issued in the impugned order dated 25.10.2010 by\n\nthe learned Single Judge could not have been approved. The Division\n\nBench of the High Court was conscious of the fact that such a mandamus\n\ncannot be issued so as to direct the State Government to carry out a\n\nparticular amendment and, therefore, in the impugned judgment and order\n\ndated 20.12.2012, termed such a direction as being “advisory” in nature.\n\nHowever, the Division Bench went miles ahead in the very next proposition\n\nwhile observing that the State Government “shall” carry out this direction.\n\nConverting an advice to the State Government into a mandate in this\n\nmanner, with great respect, is neither permissible nor countenanced by\n\nlaw.\n\n22. Learned counsel for the respondents, in all fairness, have made a\n\nplea in the last that this Court may exercise the powers under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution of India to fill the gaps and to provide for pensionary\n\nbenefits to the employees of the Board so as to do complete justice. In this\n\nregard too, even while respecting the endeavour, we could only observe\n\nthat under\nArticle 142\nof the Constitution of India, this Court cannot issue\n\ndirections in violation of the statutory provisions; and sympathy or\n\nsentiment, by itself, cannot be a ground for passing an order beyond and\n\ncontrary to the legal rights. In the face of existing Regulation 52, we find it\n\ndifficult to accede to the prayer made by the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents. In this regard, we could only reiterate that nothing contained\n\nin this judgment shall otherwise be of any impediment, if the State\n\nGovernment would be willing to carry out any amendment to the\n\nRegulations of 1960.\n\n23. Subject to the observations foregoing, this appeal succeeds and is\n\nallowed; the impugned orders are set aside; and the writ petition filed by\n\nthe respondent No. 1 is dismissed. No costs.\n\n…….....……………………. J.\n\n(DINESH MAHESHWARI)\n\n…….....……………………. J.\n\n(SANJAY KUMAR)\n\nNEW DELHI;\n\nMARCH 17, 2023.",
