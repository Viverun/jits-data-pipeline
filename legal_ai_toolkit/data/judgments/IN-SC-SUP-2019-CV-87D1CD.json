The enactment provides, among other things, for consequential\n\nseniority to persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes2 and Scheduled Tribes3\n\npromoted under the reservation policy of the State of Karnataka. The law protects\n\nconsequential seniority from 24 April 1978.\n\n2 The Reservation Act 2018 was preceded in time by the Karnataka\n\nDetermination of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of\n\nthe Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act 20024. The\n\nconstitutional validity of the Reservation Act 2002 was challenged in B K Pavitra\n\nv Union of India5, (―B K Pavitra I‖). A two judge Bench of this Court (consisting\n\nof Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel and Justice U U Lalit) held Sections 3 and 4 of the\n\nReservation Act 2002 to be ultra vires\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution on\n\nthe ground that an exercise for determining ―inadequacy of representation‖,\n\n―backwardness‖ and the impact on ―overall efficiency‖ had not preceded the\n\nenactment of the law.\nSuch an exercise was held to be mandated by the decision\n\nof a Constitution Bench of this Court in\nM Nagaraj v Union of India6 (―Nagaraj‖\n).\nReservation Act 2018\nSCs\nSTs\nReservation Act 2002\n(2017) 4 SCC 620\n(2006) 8 SCC 212\nPART B\n\nIn the absence of the State of Karnataka having collected quantifiable data on\n\nthe above three parameters, the Reservation Act 2002 was held to be invalid.\n\n3 The legislature in the State of Karnataka enacted the Reservation Act 2018\n\nafter this Court invalidated the Reservation Act 2002 in B K Pavitra I. The\n\ngrievance of the petitioners is that the state legislature has virtually re-enacted\n\nthe earlier legislation without curing its defects. According to the petitioners, it is\n\nnot open to a legislative body governed by the parameters of a written\n\nconstitution to override a judicial decision, without taking away its basis. On the\n\nother hand, the State government has asserted that an exercise for collecting\n\n―quantifiable data‖ was in fact carried out, consistent with the parameters required\n\nby the decision in Nagaraj. The petitioners question both the process and the\n\noutcome of the exercise carried out by the state for collecting quantifiable data.\n\nB The constitutional backdrop to reservations in Karnataka\nThe present case\nnecessitates that this Court weave through the body of\n\nprecedent which forms a part of our constitutional jurisprudence on the issue of\n\nreservations. In many ways, the issues before the Court are unique. For, in the\n\npost Nagaraj world which governs this body of law, the State government\n\ndefends its legislation on the ground that it has fulfilled the constitutional\n\nrequirement of collecting quantifiable data before it enacted the law. If such an\n\nexercise has been carried out, the Court will need to address itself to the\n\nstandard of judicial review by a constitutional court of a legislation enacted by a\n\ncompetent legislature. The extent to which a data collection exercise by the\nPART B\n\ngovernment, which precedes the enactment of the law, may be reviewed by the\n\nCourt is a seminal issue. B K Pavitra I involved a situation where this Court\n\ninvalidated a law on the ground that no exercise of data collection was carried out\n\nby the State of Karnataka. In the present batch of cases, (herein referred to as B\n\nK Pavitra II), there is a constitutional challenge to the validity of a law enacted\n\nafter the State had undertaken the exercise of collecting quantifiable data.\n\nWhether that exercise of data collection and the enactment of the new law which\n\nhas emerged on its foundation takes away the basis of or the cause for the\n\ninvalidation of the Reservation Act 2002 in B K Pavitra I is an essential question\n\nfor our consideration.\n\nIn this background, we set out the significant facts, in the chequered history of the\n\npresent case.\n\n5 In exercise of the power conferred by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\n\nConstitution, the Governor of Karnataka framed the Karnataka Government\n\nServant (Seniority Rules) 19577. Rules 2 and 4 provide for seniority on the basis\n\nof the period of service in a given cadre. There was no specific rule governing\n\nseniority in respect of roster promotions.\n\nRule 2 inter alia, provides as follows:\n\n―2. Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained the\nseniority of a person in a particular cadre of service or class\nof post shall be determined as follows:-\n\n(a) Officers appointed substantively in clear vacancies shall\nbe senior to all persons appointed on officiating or any\nother basis in the same cadre of service or class of post;\nThe Rules 1957\nPART B\n\n(b) The seniority inter se of officers who are confirmed shall\nbe determined according to dates of confirmation, but\nwhere the date of confirmation of any two officers is the\nsame, their relative seniority will be determined by their\nseniority inter se while officiating in the same post and if\nnot, by their seniority inter se in the lower grade.\n\n(c) Seniority inter se of persons appointed on temporary\nbasis will be determined by the dates of their continuous\nofficiation in that grade and where the period of officiation\nis the same the seniority inter se in the lower grade shall\nprevail.‖\n\nRule 4 provides for the determination of seniority where promotions are made at\n\nthe same time on the basis of seniority-cum-merit to a class of posts or cadre:\n\n―4. When promotions to a class of post or cadre are made on\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit at the same time, the relative\nseniority shall be determined.-\n\n(i) if promotions are made from any one cadre or class of\npost, by their seniority inter se in the lower cadre or class\nof post;\n\n(ii) if promotions are made from several cadres or classes of\nposts of the same grade, by the period of service in those\ngrades;\n\n(iii) if promotions are made from several cadres or classes of\nposts, the grades of which are not the same, by the order\nin which the candidates are arranged by the authority\nmaking the promotion, in consultation with Public Service\nCommission where such consultation is necessary, taking\ninto consideration the order in which promotions are to be\nmade from those several cadres or classes of post.‖\n\nRule 4-A provides for the determination of the seniority where promotion is made\n\nby selection:\n\n―4-A When promotions to a class of post or cadre are\nmade by selection at the same time either from several\ncadres or classes of post or from same cadre or class of post\nby the order in which the candidates are arranged in order of\nmerit by the Appointing Authority making the selection, in\nconsultation with Public Service Commission where such\nconsultation is necessary.\nPART B\n\n[Explanation – For purposes of this rule, ―several cadres or\nclasses of post‖ shall be deemed to include cadres or classes\nof post of different grades from which recruitment is made in\nany specified order of priority in accordance with any special\nrules of recruitment.].‖\n\n6 Reservation for persons belonging to SCs and STs in specified categories\n\nof promotional posts was introduced by a Government Order8 dated 27 April 1978\n\nof the Government of Karnataka. Reservation in promotional posts for SCs was\n\nset at 15 per cent and for STs at 3 per cent in all cadres up to and inclusive of the\n\nlowest category of Class I posts in which there is no element of direct recruitment\n\nor where the direct recruitment does not exceed 662/3 per cent. A 33 point roster\n\nwas applicable to each cadre of posts under appointing authorities. Inter-se\n\nseniority amongst persons promoted on any occasion was to be determined in\n\naccordance with Rules 4 and 4-A, as the case may be, of the Rules 1957. It also\n\nstipulated that vacancies would not be carried forward.\n\n7 On 1 June 1978, the State government issued an Official Memorandum9\n\nproviding guidelines and clarifications for implementing the Government Order\n\ndated 27 April 1978. The Official Memorandum stipulated that after promotion,\n\nseniority among candidates promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit shall,\n\non each occasion, be fixed in accordance with Rule 4 of the Rules 1957. In other\n\nwords, seniority would be governed by the inter se seniority in the cadre from\n\nwhich candidates were promoted. For candidates promoted by selection,\n\nseniority would be governed by Rule 4-A : the ranking would be as assigned in\nG.O. No. DPAR 29 SBC 77\nO.M. No. DPAR 29 SBC 77\nPART B\n\nthe list of selected candidates by the appointing authority. The Official\n\nMemorandum dated 1 June 1978 thus provided, what can be described as the\n\nprinciple of consequential seniority to reserved category candidates.\n\n8 By a notification10 dated 1 April 1992, a proviso was inserted to Rule 8 of\n\nthe Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules 197711 which provided\n\nthat vacancies not filled by SCs and STs would be treated as a backlog and\n\nwould be made good in the future. This provision was upheld by a two judge\n\nBench of this Court in Bhakta Ramegowda v State of Karnataka12 (―Bhakta\n\nRamegowda‖).\n\n9 On 16 November 1992, a nine judge Bench of this Court delivered\n\njudgment in Indra Sawhney v Union of India13 (―Indra Sawhney‖). The issue as\n\nto whether reservations of promotional posts were contemplated by\nArticle 16\n\n(4)14 -\nwhen it used the expression ‗appointment‘ was among the issues dealt\n\nwith. Justice B P Jeevan Reddy speaking for a plurality of four judges held that:\n\n(i) Reservations contemplated by\nArticle 16 (4)\nof the Constitution should not\n\nexceed 50 per cent15. While 50 per cent shall be the rule, ―it is necessary\n\nnot to put out of consideration certain extraordinary situations inherent in\nNo. DPAR 13 SRR 92\nThe Rules 1977\n(1997) 2 SCC 661\n1992 Supp (3) SCC 217\nClauses (1) and (4) of\nArticle 16\nprovide:\n\n(1) There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment\nto any office under the State.\n\n…\n(4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of\nappointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not\nadequately represented in the services under the State.\nSupra 13, paragraph 809 at page 735\nPART B\n\nthe great diversity of this country and the people‖ 16. But, any relaxation of\n\nthe strict rule must be with extreme caution and on a special case being\n\nmade out17;\n\n(ii) Reservations under\nArticle 16 (4)\ncould only be provided at the time of\n\nentry into government service but not in matters of promotion. However,\n\nthis principle would operate only prospectively and not affect promotions\n\nalready made. Moreover, reservations already provided in promotions shall\n\ncontinue in operation for a period of five years from the date of the\n\njudgment18;\n\n(iii) The creamy layer can be and must be excluded. Justice B P Jeevan\n\nReddy held :\n\n―792…While we agree that clause (4) aims at group\nbackwardness, we feel that exclusion of such socially\nadvanced members will make the ‗class‘ a truly backward\nclass and would more appropriately serve the purpose and\nobject of clause (4). (This discussion is confined to Other\nBackward Classes only and has no relevance in the case of\nScheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes).‖19\n\n(iv) The adequacy of the representation of a backward class of citizens in\n\nservices ―is a matter within the subjective satisfaction of the State‖ 20, since\n\nthe requirement in\nArticle 16 (4)\nis preceded by the words ―in the opinion of\n\nthe State‖. The basis of the standard of judicial review was formulated\n\nthus:\n\n―798…This opinion can be formed by the State on its own,\ni.e., on the basis of the material it has in its possession\nalready or it may gather such material through a\nCommission/Committee, person or authority. All that is\nIbid, paragraph 810 at page 735\nIbid, paragraph 810 at page 735\nIbid, paragraphs 827, 829, 859 (7) and 860(8) at pages 745, 747, 768 and 771\nIbid at page 725\nIbid, paragraph 798 at page 728\nPART B\n\nrequired is, there must be some material upon which the\nopinion is formed. Indeed, in this matter the court should\nshow due deference to the opinion of the State, which in the\npresent context means the executive. The executive is\nsupposed to know the existing conditions in the society,\ndrawn as it is from among the representatives of the people in\nParliament/Legislature. It does not, however, mean that the\nopinion formed is beyond judicial scrutiny altogether. The\nscope and reach of judicial scrutiny in matters within\nsubjective satisfaction of the executive are well and\nextensively stated in\nBarium Chemicals v. Company Law\nBoard\n[1966 Supp SCR 311 : AIR 1967 SC 295] which need\nnot be repeated here. Suffice it to mention that the said\nprinciples apply equally in the case of a constitutional\nprovision like\nArticle 16(4)\nwhich expressly places the\nparticular fact (inadequate representation) within the\nsubjective judgment of the State/executive.‖21\n\n(v) The backward class of citizens cannot be identified only and exclusively\n\nwith reference to an economic criterion22. It is permissible to identify a\n\nbackward class of citizens with reference to occupation, income as well\n\ncaste.\n\n10 In view of the decision of this Court in Indra Sawhney, the provisions for\n\nreservation in matters of promotion under the Government Order of 1978, as\n\nclarified by the Official Memorandum dated 1 June 1978 were saved for a period\n\nof five years from 16 November 1992. Promotions already made were saved.\n\n11 On 17 June 1995, Parliament acting in its constituent capacity adopted the\n\nseventy-seventh amendment by which clause (4A) was inserted into\nArticle 16\nto\n\nenable reservations to be made in promotion in favour of the SCs and STs23. The\nIbid at page 728\nIbid, paragraph 799 at page 728\nClause 16 (4A) : Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in\nmatters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of the Scheduled\nPART B\n\namendment came into force on 17 June 1995, before the expiry of five years from\n\n16 November 1992 (the date on which the decision in Indra Sawhney was\n\npronounced). As a result of the decision in Indra Sawhney and the seventy-\n\nseventh amendment to the Constitution, the provision for reservations made by\n\nthe Government of Karnataka under the Government Order of 1978 stood saved\n\nand continued to operate.\n\n12 On 10 February 1995, a Constitution Bench of this Court rendered a\n\njudgment in\nR K Sabharwal v State of Punjab24 (―Sabharwal‖\n) and held that:\n\n(i) Once the prescribed percentage of posts is filled by reserved category\n\ncandidates by the operation of the roster, the numerical test of adequacy is\n\nsatisfied and the roster would cease to operate25;\n\n(ii) The percentage of reservation has to be worked out in relation to the\n\nnumber of posts which form the cadre strength. The concept of vacancy\n\nhas no relevance in operating the percentage of reservation26; and\n\n(iii) The interpretation placed on the working of the roster shall operate\n\nprospectively27 from 10 February 1995.\n\n13 On 1 October 1995, a two judge Bench of this Court held in\nUnion of India\n\nv Virpal Singh Chauhan28 (―Virpal Singh‖\n) that the state could provide that even\n\nif a candidate belonging to the SC or ST is promoted earlier on the basis of\n\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not adequately represented in the\nservices under the State.\n(1995) 2 SCC 745\nIbid, paragraph 5 at page 750\nIbid, paragraph 6 at page 751\nIbid, paragraph 11 at page753\n(1995) 6 SCC 684\nPART B\n\nreservation and on the application of the roster, this would entitle such a person\n\nto seniority over a senior belonging to the general category in the feeder cadre.\n\nHowever, a senior belonging to the general category who is promoted to a higher\n\npost subsequently would regain seniority over the reserved candidate who was\n\npromoted earlier. This rule came to be known as the catch-up rule. The two judge\n\nBench directed that the above principle would be followed with effect from the\n\ndate in the judgment in Sabharwal29.\n\n14 Six months after the decision in Virpal Singh, on 1 March 1996, a three\n\njudge Bench of this Court in Ajit Singh Januja v State of Punjab30 (―Ajit Singh\n\nI‖), adopted the catch-up rule propounded in Virpal Singh, to the effect that the\n\nseniority between reserved category candidates and general candidates in the\n\npromoted category shall continue to be governed by their inter se seniority in the\n\nlower grades. This Court held that a balance has to be maintained so as to avoid\n\n―reverse discrimination‖ and, a rule or circular which gives seniority to a candidate\n\nbelonging to the reserved category promoted on the basis of roster points would\n\nviolate\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n15 On 24 June 1997, the Government of Karnataka issued a Government\n\nOrder31 formulating guidelines in regard to the manner in which backlog\n\nvacancies were required to be filled. On 3 February 1999, the Government of\n10 February 1995\n(1996) 2 SCC 715\nG.O. No. DPAR 10 SCBC 97\nPART B\n\nKarnataka issued another Government Order32 pursuant to\nArticle 16 (4A)\n\nstipulating a modified policy of reservation in matters of promotion. The 1999\n\nOrder provides for reservation in promotion to the extent of 15 per cent for SCs\n\nand 3 per cent for STs of the posts in a cadre up to and inclusive of the lowest\n\ncategory of group A posts in each service for which there is no element of direct\n\nrecruitment or, where the proportionate of direct recruitment does not exceed\n\n662/3 per cent. While providing for the continuance of reservations in promotion,\n\nthe Government Order stipulated that reservation in favour of persons belonging\n\nto the SCs shall continue to operate until their representation in a cadre reaches\n\n15 per cent. Reservations in promotion for the STs would continue to operate\n\nuntil their representation in a cadre reaches 3 per cent. Thereafter, reservation in\n\npromotion shall continue only to maintain the representation to the extent of the\n\nabove percentages for the respective categories. On 13 April 1999, the\n\nGovernment of Karnataka issued another Government Order33 modifying the\n\n1999 Order to provide that reservations in promotions in favour of the SCs and\n\nSTs shall continue to operate by applying the existing roster to the vacancies till\n\nthe representation of persons belonging to these categories reached 15 per cent\n\nor 3 per cent as the case may be, respectively. Moreover, after the existing\n\nbacklog was cleared, the representation of persons belonging to SCs and STs\n\nwould be maintained to the extent of 15 per cent and 3 per cent of the total\n\nworking strength.\nG.O. No. DPAR 21 SBC 97\nIbid\nPART B\n\n16 In\nJagdish Lal v State of Haryana34, (―Jagdish Lal‖\n) a three judge Bench\n\nof this Court took a view contrary to the decision in Ajit Singh I. The decision in\n\nJagdish Lal held that by virtue of the principle of continuous officiation, a\n\ncandidate belonging to a reserved category who is promoted earlier than a\n\ngeneral category candidate due to an accelerated promotion would not lose\n\nseniority in the higher cadre.\n\nThis conflict of decisions was resolved by a\n\nConstitution Bench in\nAjit Singh v State of Punjab35 (―Ajit Singh II‖\n). The\n\nConstitution Bench held that\nArticle 16 (4A)\nis only an enabling provision for\n\nreservation in promotion. In consequence, roster point promotees belonging to\n\nthe reserved categories could not count their seniority in the promoted category\n\nfrom the date of continuance officiation in the promoted post in relation to general\n\ncategory candidates who were senior to them in the lower category and who\n\nwere promoted later. Where a senior general candidate at the lower level is\n\npromoted later than a reserved category candidate, but before the further\n\npromotion of the latter, such a person will have to be treated as senior at the\n\npromotional level in relation to the reserved candidate who was promoted earlier.\n\nThe Constitution Bench accordingly applied the catch-up rule for determining the\n\nseniority of roster point promotees vis-à-vis general category candidates. The\n\nCourt held that any circular, order or rule that was issued to confer seniority to\n\nroster point promotees would be invalid. However, the Constitution Bench\n\ndirected that candidates who were promoted contrary to the above principles of\n\nlaw before 1 March 1999 (the date of the decision in Ajit Singh I) need not be\n\nreverted.\n(1997) 6 SCC 538\n(1999) 7 SCC 209\nPART B\n\n17 Contending that there was no provision permitting seniority to be granted\n\nin respect of roster point promotees belonging to the reserved categories, the\n\nreservation policy of the State of Karnataka came to be challenged before this\n\nCourt in M G Badappanavar v State of Karnataka36 (―Badappanavar‖). A three\n\njudge Bench, relying on the decisions in Ajit Singh I, Ajit Singh II and\n\nSabharwal reiterated the principle that\nArticle 16 (4A)\ndoes not permit the\n\nconferment of seniority to roster point promotees. This Court held that there was\n\nno specific rule in the State of Karnataka permitting seniority to be counted in\n\nrespect of a roster promotion. It held thus:\n\n―12…The roster promotions were, it was held, meant only for\nthe limited purpose of due representation of backward\nclasses at various levels of service. If the rules are to be\ninterpreted in a manner conferring seniority to the roster-point\npromotees, who have not gone through the normal channel\nwhere basic seniority or selection process is involved, then\nthe rules, it was held will be ultra vires\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India.\nArticle 16(4-A)\ncannot also\nhelp. Such seniority, if given, would amount to treating\nunequals equally, rather, more than equals.‖37\n\n18 The conferment of seniority to roster point promotees of the reserved\n\ncategories would, in view of the court in Badappanavar, violate the equality\n\nprinciple which was part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Court\n\ndirected that the seniority lists and promotions be reviewed in accordance with its\n\ndirections but those who were promoted before 1 March 1996 on principles\n\ncontrary to Ajit Singh II and those who were promoted contrary to Sabharwal\n\nbefore 10 February 1995 need not be reverted.\n(2001) 2 SCC 666\nIbid at page 672\nPART B\nThe Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act\n2001 was enacted with\n\neffect from 17 June 1995.\nArticle 16 (4A)\n, as amended, reads thus:\n\n―Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making\nany provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with\nconsequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in\nthe services under the State in favour of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the\nState, are not adequately represented in the services under\nthe State.‖ (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe purpose of the amendment was to enable the grant of consequential\n\nseniority to reserved categories promotees. The significance of the date on which\n\nthe eighty-fifth amendment came into force – 17 June 1995 – is that it coincides\n\nwith the coming into force of the seventy-seventh amendment which enabled\n\nreservations in promotions to be made for the SCs and STs.\n\n20 In 2002, the Karnataka State Legislature enacted the Reservation Act\n\n2002. The law came into force on 17 June 1995. It provided for consequential\n\nseniority to roster point promotees based on the length of service in a cadre,\n\nmaking the catch-up rule propounded in Ajit Singh II inapplicable. The earlier\n\ndecision of this Court in Badappanavar had held that there was no specific rule\n\nfor the conferment of seniority to roster point promotees. By the enactment of the\n\nReservation Act 2002 with effect from 17 June 1995, the principle of\n\nconsequential seniority was statutorily incorporated as a legislative mandate.\n\n21 The validity of the seventy-seventh and eighty-fifth amendments to the\n\nConstitution and of the legislation enacted in pursuance of those amendments\nPART B\n\nwas challenged before a Constitution Bench of this Court in Nagaraj. The\n\nConstitution Bench analysed whether the replacement of the catch-up rule with\n\nconsequential seniority violated the basic structure and equality principle under\n\nthe Constitution. Upholding the constitutional validity of the amendments, this\n\nCourt held that the catch-up rule and consequential seniority are judicially\n\nevolved concepts based on service jurisprudence. Hence, the exercise of the\n\nenabling power under\nArticle 16 (4A)\nwas held not to violate the basic features of\n\nthe Constitution:\n\n―79. Reading the above judgments, we are of the view that\nthe concept of ―catch-up‖ rule and ―consequential seniority‖\nare judicially evolved concepts to control the extent of\nreservation. The source of these concepts is in service\njurisprudence. These concepts cannot be elevated to the\nstatus of an axiom like secularism, constitutional sovereignty,\netc. It cannot be said that by insertion of the concept of\n―consequential seniority‖ the structure of\nArticle 16(1)\nstands\ndestroyed or abrogated. It cannot be said that ―equality code‖\nunder\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\nis violated by deletion of the\n―catch-up‖ rule. These concepts are based on practices.\nHowever, such practices cannot be elevated to the status of a\nconstitutional principle so as to be beyond the amending\npower of Parliament. Principles of service jurisprudence are\ndifferent from constitutional limitations. Therefore, in our view\nneither the ―catch-up‖ rule nor the concept of ―consequential\nseniority‖ is implicit in clauses (1) and (4) of\nArticle 16\nas\ncorrectly held in Virpal Singh Chauhan.‖38\n\n22 The Constitution Bench held that\nArticle 16 (4A)\nis an enabling provision.\n\nThe state is not bound to make reservations for the SCs and STs in promotions.\n\nBut, if it seeks to do so, it must collect quantifiable data on three facets:\n\n(i) The backwardness of the class;\nSupra 6 at page 259\nPART B\n\n(ii) The inadequacy of the representation of that class in public employment;\n\nand\n\n(iii) The general efficiency of service as mandated by\nArticle 335\nwould not be\n\neffected.\n\n23 The principles governing this approach emerge from the following extracts\n\nfrom the decision:\n\n―107. …If the State has quantifiable data to show\nbackwardness and inadequacy then the State can make\nreservations in promotions keeping in mind maintenance of\nefficiency which is held to be a constitutional limitation on the\ndiscretion of the State in making reservation as indicated by\n\nArticle 335.\nAs stated above, the concepts of efficiency,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation are required to\nbe identified and measured…39\n\n…\n\n117… in each case the Court has got to be satisfied that the\nState has exercised its opinion in making reservations in\npromotions for SCs and STs and for which the State\nconcerned will have to place before the Court the requisite\nquantifiable data in each case and satisfy the Court that such\nreservations became necessary on account of inadequacy of\nrepresentation of SCs/STs in a particular class or classes of\nposts without affecting general efficiency of service as\nmandated under\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution.40\n\n…\n\n123. … In this regard the State concerned will have to show\nin each case the existence of the compelling reasons,\nnamely, backwardness, inadequacy of representation and\noverall administrative efficiency before making provision for\nreservation. As stated above, the impugned provision is an\nenabling provision. The State is not bound to make\nreservation for SCs/STs in matters of promotions. However, if\nthey wish to exercise their discretion and make such\nprovision, the State has to collect quantifiable data showing\nbackwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation\nIbid at pages 270-271\nIbid at pages 276-277\nPART B\n\nof that class in public employment in addition to compliance\nwith\nArticle 335.\nIt is made clear that even if the State has\ncompelling reasons, as stated above, the State will have to\nsee that its reservation provision does not lead to\nexcessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50% or\nobliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation\nindefinitely.‖41\n\nThe Constitution Bench held that the constitutional amendments do not abrogate\n\nthe fundamentals of equality:\n\n―110…the boundaries of the width of the power, namely, the\nceiling limit of 50% (the numerical benchmark), the principle\nof creamy layer, the compelling reasons, namely,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation and the overall\nadministrative efficiency are not obliterated by the impugned\namendments. At the appropriate time, we have to consider\nthe law as enacted by various States providing for reservation\nif challenged. At that time we have to see whether limitations\non the exercise of power are violated. The State is free to\nexercise its discretion of providing for reservation subject to\nlimitation, namely, that there must exist compelling reasons of\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation in a class of\npost(s) keeping in mind the overall administrative efficiency. It\nis made clear that even if the State has reasons to make\nreservation, as stated above, if the impugned law violates any\nof the above substantive limits on the width of the power the\nsame would be liable to be set aside.‖42\n\nThese observations emphasise the parameters which must be applied where a\n\nlaw has been enacted to give effect to the provisions of\nArticle 16 (4A).\nThe\n\nlegislative power of the state to enact such a law is preserved. The exercise of\n\nthe power to legislate is conditioned by the existence of ―compelling reasons‖\n\nnamely; the existence of backwardness, the inadequacy of representation and\n\noverall administrative efficiency. Elsewhere in the decision, the Constitution\n\nBench treated these three parameters as ―controlling factors‖ for making\nIbid at page 278\nIbid at page 272\nPART B\n\nreservations in promotions for SCs and STs. They were held to be constitutional\n\nrequirements crucial to the preservation of ―the structure of equality of\n\nopportunity‖ in\nArticle 16.\nThe Constitution Bench left the validity of the individual\n\nenactments of the states to be adjudicated upon separately by Benches of this\n\nCourt.\n\n24 In B K Pavitra I, a two judge Bench of this Court considered a challenge to\n\nthe Reservation Act 2002 providing for consequential seniority on the ground that\n\nthe exercise which was required to be carried out in Nagaraj had not been\n\nundertaken by the State and there was no provision for the exclusion of the\n\ncreamy layer. The validity of the Reservation Act 2002 had been upheld by a\n\nDivision Bench of the Karnataka High Court. In B K Pavitra I, this Court struck\n\ndown Sections 3 and 4 of the Reservation Act 2002 as ultra vires Articles 14 and\n\n16. The petitioner contended that the law laid down by this Court in\n\nBadappanavar, Ajit Singh II and Virpal Singh remained applicable despite the\n\nConstitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act\n2001. Moreover, it was contended that\n\nthe Government of Karnataka had not complied with the tests laid down in\n\nNagaraj and had failed to provide any material or data to show inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation. Moreover, no consideration was given to the issue of overall\n\nadministrative efficiency. The principal challenge was that an exercise for\n\ndetermining ―backwardness‖, ―inadequacy of representation‖, and ―overall\n\nefficiency‖ in terms of the decision in Nagaraj had not been carried out.\nPART B\n\n25 Relying on the decisions of this Court in\nSuraj Bhan Meena v State of\n\nRajasthan43\n,\nUttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd v Rajesh Kumar44\nand S\n\nPanneer Selvam v State of Tamil Nadu45 (―Panneer Selvam‖), a two judge\n\nBench of this Court affirmed that the exercise laid down in Nagaraj for\n\ndetermining ―inadequacy of representation‖, ―backwardness‖ and ―overall\n\nefficiency‖ is necessary for recourse to the enabling power under\nArticle 16 (4A)\n\nof the Constitution. The Court held that the Government of Karnataka had failed\n\nto place material on record showing that there was a compelling necessity for the\n\nexercise of the power under\nArticle 16 (4A).\nHence, the directions laid down by\n\nthis Court in Nagaraj were not followed. Striking down Sections 3 and 4 of the\n\nReservation Act 2002, this Court held thus:\n\n―29. It is clear from the above discussion in S. Panneer\nSelvam case that exercise for determining ―inadequacy of\nrepresentation‖, ―backwardness‖ and ―overall efficiency‖, is a\nmust for exercise of power under\nArticle 16(4-A).\nMere fact\nthat there is no proportionate representation in promotional\nposts for the population of SCs and STs is not by itself\nenough to grant consequential seniority to promotees who are\notherwise junior and thereby denying seniority to those who\nare given promotion later on account of reservation policy. It\nis for the State to place material on record that there was\ncompelling necessity for exercise of such power and decision\nof the State was based on material including the study that\noverall efficiency is not compromised. In the present case, no\nsuch exercise has been undertaken. The High Court\nerroneously observed that it was for the petitioners to plead\nand prove that the overall efficiency was adversely affected\nby giving consequential seniority to junior persons who got\npromotion on account of reservation. Plea that persons\npromoted at the same time were allowed to retain their\nseniority in the lower cadre is untenable and ignores the fact\nthat a senior person may be promoted later and not at the\nsame time on account of roster point reservation. Depriving\nhim of his seniority affects his further chances of promotion.\nFurther plea that seniority was not a fundamental right is\n(2011) 1 SCC 467\n(2012) 7 SCC 1\n(2015) 10 SCC 292\nPART B\n\nequally without any merit in the present context. In absence of\nexercise under\nArticle 16(4-A)\n, it is the ―catch-up‖ rule which\nfully applies. It is not necessary to go into the question\nwhether the Corporation concerned had adopted the rule of\nconsequential seniority.‖46\n\nThe Court clarified that the decision will not affect those who have already retired\n\nand availed of financial benefits. It was further directed that promotions granted to\n\nexisting employees based on consequential seniority are liable to be reviewed\n\nand that the seniority list be revised in terms of the decision. Three months were\n\ngranted to take further consequential action. Petitions seeking a review of the\n\ndecision have been tagged with the present proceedings.\n\n26 After the decision of this Court in B K Pavitra I, on 22 March 2017, the\n\nGovernment of Karnataka constituted the Ratna Prabha Committee47 headed by\n\nthe Additional Chief Secretary to the State of Karnataka to submit a report on the\n\nbackwardness and inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in the State\n\nCivil Services and the impact of reservation on overall administrative efficiency in\n\nthe State of Karnataka. The tasks entrusted to the Committee were to:\n\n―1) Collect information on the cadre-wise representation of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in all the\nGovernment Departments;\n\n2) Collect information regarding backwardness of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes; and\n\n3) Study the effect on the administration due to the provision\nof reservation in promotion to the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes.‖\nSupra 6 at page 641\nG.O. No. DPAR 182 SeneNi 2011\nPART B\n\n27 On 5 May 2017, the Ratna Prabha Committee submitted a report, titled as\n\nthe ‗Report on Backwardness, Inadequacy of Representation and\n\nAdministrative Efficiency in Karnataka‘48. The Government of Karnataka,\n\nthrough its Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, submitted the\n\nRatna Prabha Committee report to the Law Commission of Karnataka on 8 June\n\n2017. The Law Commission sought to opine on ‗whether the data collected and\n\nreasons assigned by the Ratna Prabha Committee constitute a valid basis for\n\nvalidating the law‘ and submitted its report on 27 July 2017.\n\n28 In the meantime, the petitioners filed contempt petitions contending that\n\nthe directions of this Court in B K Pavitra I to the State of Karnataka to review\n\nthe seniority list were not complied with. The State of Karnataka filed applications\n\nfor extension of time for compliance. On 20 March 2018, this Court disposed of\n\nthe petitions rejecting the applications for extension of time for compliance with\n\nthe decision in B K Pavitra I and granted one month time to take any\n\nconsequential action. The State of Karnataka subsequently filed compliance\n\naffidavits before this Court stating that the exercise directed by the decision in B\n\nK Pavitra I had been carried out.\n\n29 On the basis of the Ratna Prabha Committee report, the Government of\n\nKarnataka introduced the Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to\n\nGovernment Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the\n\nCivil Services of the State) Bill 2017. The Bill was passed by the Legislative\nRatna Prabha Committee report\nPART B\n\nAssembly on 17 November 2017 and by the Legislative Council on 23 November\n\n2017. On 16 December 2017, the Governor of the Karnataka reserved the Bill for\n\nthe consideration of the President of India under\nArticle 200\nof the Constitution.\n\nThe Bill received the assent of the President on 14 June 2018 and was published\n\nin the official Gazette on 23 June 2018.\n\n30 Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Reservation Act 2018 provides as follows :\n\n―3. Determination of Seniority of the Government\nServants Promoted on the basis of Reservation.-\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the\ntime being in force, the Government Servants belonging to\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes promoted in\naccordance with the policy of reservation in promotion\nprovided for in the Reservation Order shall be entitled to\nconsequential seniority. Seniority shall be determined on the\nbasis of the length of service in a cadre:\n\nProvided that the seniority inter-se of the Government\nServants belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes as well as those belonging to the\nunreserved category, promoted to a cadre, at the same time\nby a common order, shall be determined on the basis of their\nseniority inter-se, in the lower cadre.\n\nProvided further that where the posts in a cadre, according to\nthe rules of recruitment applicable to them are required to be\nfilled by promotion from two or more lower cadres,-\n\n(i) The number of vacancies available in the promotional\n(higher) cadre for each of the lower cadres according to the\nrules of recruitment applicable to it shall be calculated; and\n\n(ii) The roster shall be applied separately to the number of\nvacancies so calculated in respect of each of those lower\ncadres:\n\nProvided also that the serial numbers of the roster points\nspecified in the Reservation Order are intended only to\nfacilitate calculation of the number of vacancies reserved for\npromotion at a time and such roster points are not intended to\ndetermine inter-se seniority of the Government Servants\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\nvis-a-vis the Government Servants belonging to the\nunreserved category promoted at the same time and such\nPART B\n\ninter-se seniority shall be determined by their seniority inter-\nse in the cadre from which they are promoted, as illustrated in\nthe Schedule appended to this Act.\n\n4. Protection of consequential seniority already\naccorded from 27th April 1978 onwards.- Notwithstanding\nanything contained in this Act or any other law for the time\nbeing in force, the consequential seniority already accorded\nto the Government servants belonging to the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes who were promoted in\naccordance with the policy of reservation in promotion\nprovided for in the Reservation Order with effect from the\nTwenty Seventh Day of April, Nineteen Hundred and Seventy\nEight shall be valid and shall be protected and shall not be\ndisturbed.\n\n5. Provision for review.- All promotions to the posts\nbelonging to the State Civil Services shall be within the extent\nand in accordance with the provisions of the reservation\norders and other rules pertaining to method of recruitment\nand seniority. The Appointing Authority shall revise and\nredraw the existing seniority lists to ensure that the\npromotions are made accordingly:\n\nProvided that subsequent to such a review, wherever it is\nfound that Government Servants belonging to the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes were promoted against\nreservation and backlog vacancies in excess or contrary to\nextent of reservation provided in the reservation orders shall\nbe adjusted and fitted with reference to the roster points in\naccordance with the reservation orders issued from time to\ntime by assigning appropriate dates of eligibility. In case, if\npersons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes who have already been promoted against\nreservation or backlog vacancies in excess or contrary to the\nextent of reservation provisions cannot get adjusted and fitted\nagainst the roster points they shall be continued against\nsupernumerary posts, to be created by the concerned\nadministrative department presuming concurrence of Finance\nDepartment, in the cadres in which they are currently working,\ntill they get the date of eligibility for promotion in that cadre.‖\n\nSection 9 provides for the validation of action taken in respect of promotions\n\nsince 27 April 1978:\n\n―9. Validation of action taken under the provisions of\nthis Act.- Notwithstanding anything contained in any\nPART B\n\nJudgment, Decree or Order of any court, tribunal or other\nauthority contrary to section 3 and 4 of this Act any action\ntaken or done in respect of any promotions made or\npurporting to have been made and any action or thing taken\nor done, all proceedings held and any actions purported to\nhave been done since 27th April, 1978 in relation to\npromotions as per sections 3 and 4 of this Act, before the\npublication of this Act shall be deemed to be valid and\neffective as if such promotions or action or thing has been\nmade, taken or done under this Act and accordingly:- (a) no\nsuit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in\nany court or any tribunal or before any authority for the review\nof any such promotions contrary to the provisions of this Act;\nand (b) no court shall enforce any decree or order to direct\nthe review of any such cases contrary to the provisions of this\nAct.‖\n\nSection 1 (2)\nprovides that the Reservation Act 2018 came into force with effect\n\nfrom 17 June 1995 (the effective date of the seventy-seventh and eighty-fifth\n\nconstitutional amendments).\n\n31 These proceedings were instituted to assail the vires of the Reservation\n\nAct 2018. The principal contention which has been urged is that the Reservation\n\nAct 2018 does not take away basis of the decision of this Court in B K Pavitra I\n\nand is ultra vires. All matters have been admitted for hearing and tagged\n\ntogether.\n\n32 On 27 July 2018, when the batch of cases was listed for hearing, it was\n\nsuggested by this Court that the status quo may not be altered pending\n\nconsideration of the matter. The Advocate General for the State of Karnataka\n\norally agreed and accepted an order of status quo. The Government of Karnataka\n\nissued a circular on 3 August 2018 with a direction to maintain status quo and not\nPART B\n\naffect the process of promotion/demotion till further orders from the government.\n\nThese directions were issued to all autonomous bodies, universities, public\n\nenterprises, commissions, corporations, boards and to institutions availing aid\n\nfrom the government under their administrative control.\n\n33 In\nJarnail Singh v Lachhmi Narain Gupta49, (―Jarnail‖\n) a Constitution\n\nBench of this Court considered whether the decision in Nagaraj requires to be\n\nreferred to a larger Bench since:\n\n(i) It requires the state to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of\n\nthe SCs and STs contrary to the nine judge Bench decision in Indra\n\nSawhney;\n\n(ii) The creamy layer principle was not applied to SCs and STs in Indra\n\nSawhney; and\n\n(iii) In applying the creamy layer principle, Nagaraj conflicts with the decision\n\nin E V Chinnaiah v State of AP50 (―Chinnaiah‖).\n\n34 In Jarnail, the Constitution Bench held that :\n\n(i) The decision in Chinnaiah holds, in essence, that a state law51 cannot\n\nfurther sub-divide the SCs into sub categories. Such an exercise would be\n\nviolative of\nArticle 341(2)\nsince only an Act of Parliament and not the state\n\nlegislatures can make changes in the Presidential list. Chinnaiah did not\n\ndwell on any aspect on which the constitutional amendments were upheld\n2018 (10) SCC 396\n(2005) 1 SCC 394\nThe court was considering the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Caste (Rationalisation of\nReservations) Act 2000\nPART B\n\nin Nagaraj. Hence, it was not necessary for Nagaraj to advert to the\n\ndecision in Chinnaiah. Chinnaiah dealt with a completely different\n\nproblem and not with the constitutional amendments, which were dealt with\n\nin Nagaraj52;\n\n(ii) The decision of the Constitution Bench in Nagaraj, insofar as it requires\n\nthe state to collect quantifiable data on backwardness in relation to the\n\nSCs and STs is contrary to Indra Sawhney and would have to be declared\n\nto be bad on this ground53; and\n\n(iii) Constitutional courts, when applying the principle of reservation will be\n\nwithin their jurisdiction to exclude the creamy layer on a harmonious\n\nconstruction on\nArticles 14\nand\nalong with\nArticles 341\nand 34254. The\n\ncreamy layer principle is an essential aspect of the equality code.\n\n35 On 12 October 2018, the State of Karnataka submitted before this Court\n\nthat since a legislation has been enacted by the state legislature and in view of\n\nthe judgment of the Constitution Bench in Jarnail, the State would no longer\n\nproceed on the oral assurance of the Advocate General and would not be bound\n\nto it. On the other hand, it was urged by learned Counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioners that the intent of the Reservation Act 2018 was only to nullify the effect\n\nof the judgment in B K Pavitra I. Counsel urged that in view of the decisions of\n\nthis Court including those in\nShri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd v Broach Borough\n\nMunicipality55 (―Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd‖\n) and Madan Mohan Pathak v Union\nSupra 49, paragraph 22 at page 422-423\nIbid, paragraph 24 at page 424\nIbid, paragraph 26 at page 425-426\n(1969) 2 SCC 283\nPART B\n\nof India (―Madan Mohan Pathak‖)56, it was not open to the legislature to render\n\na judgment of this Court ineffective without taking away its basis or foundation.\n\nSince the case was of an urgent nature, the proceedings were listed on 23\n\nOctober 2018 for commencement of final hearing.\n\n36 On 27 February 2019, the State of Karnataka issued a Government\n\nOrder57 directing that:\n\n―In the circumstances explained in the preamble, the following\ninstructions are hereby issued subject to the conditions that\nthe officers/officials, who have been reverted, shall be\nreposted to the cadres held by them immediately prior to their\nreversion and if vacant posts are not available in those\ncadres, supernumerary posts shall be created to\naccommodate them. It is also ordered that the\nofficers/officials working at present in those cadres, belonging\nto any category, shall not be reverted.‖\n\nThe Government Order was made subject to the outcome of these proceedings.\n\nOn 1 March 2019, this Court granted a stay on the operation of the Government\n\nOrder dated 27 February 2019. This Court observed that since the case was in\n\nthe concluding stages of the hearing, it would not be appropriate to alter the\n\npresent status when the matter was in seisin of the Court.\n(1978) 2 SCC 50\nG.O.

The decision in B K Pavitra I was\n\nrendered on 19 February 2017. On 22 March 2017, a Government Order was\n\nissued appointing the Additional Chief Secretary to submit a report on\n\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation and the impact of reservation on\n\nefficiency. The report was submitted on 5 May 2017. On 26 July 2017, the report\nPART C\n\nwas accepted by the State Cabinet which constituted a sub-committee to\n\nexamine the matter and submit a draft Bill. The State Law Commission\n\nrecommended the State to pass a legislation with retrospective effect by curing\n\nthe infirmities and factors noticed in the decision in B K Pavitra I. On 4 August\n\n2017, the Cabinet Sub-Committee submitted its decision based on the report. On\n\n7 August 2017, the Cabinet approved the proposed Bill. The Bill was introduced\n\nin the Karnataka State Legislative Assembly on 14 November 2017 and was\n\npassed on 17 November 2017. The Bill was passed by the State Legislative\n\nCouncil on 23 November 2017 and was submitted to the Governor on 6\n\nDecember 2017. The Bill was reserved by the Governor for the consideration of\n\nthe President. On 15 February 2018, 9 March 2018 and 18 April 2018, the Union\n\nGovernment in the Ministry of Home Affairs sought clarifications from the State\n\ngovernment which were provided on 16 March 2018 and 23 April 2018. The Bill\n\nreceived the assent of the President on 14 June 2018, and was published in the\n\nofficial Gazette and came into force on 23 June 2018.\n\n40 On the basis of the above facts, Dr Dhavan submitted that:\n\n(i) There was no compelling necessity to overrule B K Pavitra I ―except\n\npolitical necessities‖;\n\n(ii) A comparison of the provisions of the Reservation Act 2002 with the\n\nReservation Act 2018 indicates that:\n\n(a) The Reservation Act 2018 is substantively the same as the Reservation\n\nAct 2002;\nPART C\n\n(b) The change in the basis of the decision in B K Pavitra I is on the\n\nfactum of the Ratna Prabha Committee report;\n\n(c) ―Compelling necessities‖ are mentioned but their existence is not\n\ndemonstrated;\n\n(d) The title of the Reservation Act 2018 is limited to consequential\n\nseniority which is not mentioned in the law;\n\n(e) Section 5 allows for an unlimited backlog and the creation of\n\nsupernumerary posts for SCs and STs;\n\n(f) Section 5 presumes the permission of the Finance Department and\n\nvisualizes an ―excess‖, which will invalidate the law; and\n\n(g) Section 9 brazenly overrules and goes beyond the date of 17 June\n\n1995 and postulates that in future a review of the cases is forbidden.\n\nB Violation of the separation of powers\n\n41 Separation of powers postulates a constitutional division between\n\nlegislative and judicial functions. In this context, the submission is:\n\n(a) The legislative power is distinct from the judicial power;\n\n(b) The legislature cannot lawfully usurp judicial power by sitting in appeal\n\nover any judicial decision by attempting to overturn it;\n\n(c) Any statute which seeks to overturn a judicial decision must be within the\n\nlegislative competence of the legislature under the Seventh Schedule to\n\nthe Constitution;\n\n(d) Any such statute must change the basis of the law;\nPART C\n\n(e) The decision of a court will always be binding unless the law or conditions\n\nunderlying the legislation which was held to be invalid are so\n\nfundamentally altered so that a different result would enure;\n\n(f) While a legislation may be retroactive, an interim or final direction must be\n\nobeyed especially when rights are conferred;\n\n(g) A new legislation can be challenged on the basis that it violates the\n\nfundamental rights; and\n\n(h) Unless the basis of a legislation which is found to be ultra vires has been\n\naltered, the mere enactment of a new legislation would constitute a brazen\n\noverruling of the law, which is impermissible.\n\n42 Dr Dhavan urges that Reservation Act 2018 will not pass muster, when it is\n\nassessed in the context of the principles enunciated by the decisions of this Court\n\nin (i) Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd, (ii) Madan Mohan Pathak, (iii) S R Bhagwat v\n\nState of Mysore58, (\niv) Bakhtawar Trust v M D Narayan59\n, (\nv) Delhi Cloth &\n\nGeneral Mills Co. Ltd v State of Rajasthan60\n, (vi) Re Cauvery61, (vii) S T Sadiq\n\nv State of Kerala62 and (\nviii) Medical Council of India v State of Kerala63\n.\n\n43 Explaining the applicability of the above principles on facts, Dr Dhavan\n\nurged that after the decision of this Court in B K Pavitra I, the State Government\n\nfiled applications for extension of time on 9 May 2017 and 8 September 201764.\n(1995) 6 SCC 16\n(2003) 5 SCC 298\n(1996) 2 SCC 449\n(1993) Supp (1) SCC 96\n(2015) 4 SCC 400\n(2018) 11 SCALE 141\nM.A. Nos. 730-756 of 2017\nPART C\n\nThis Court extended time to revise the seniority lists till 30 November 2017 and\n\nfor consequential actions by 15 January 2018. On 15 January 2018, the State\n\nGovernment moved before this Court seeking extension of time for implementing\n\nthe decision in B K Pavitra I. On 29 January 2018, this Court finally granted time\n\nuntil 15 March 2018. On 17 March 2018, the State moved before this Court for\n\nextension of time and on 20 March 2018, while disposing of certain contempt\n\npetitions and other applications, one month‘s time was granted to take\n\nconsequential action. On 25 April 2018, this Court directed the State to file a\n\nfurther affidavit (by 1 May 2018) indicating that promotions and demotions have\n\nbeen duly effected. On 9 May 2018, this Court directed the State to file an\n\naffidavit to the effect that the judgment in B K Pavitra I had been fully complied\n\nwith and the hearing was posted for 4 July 2018. On 28 June 2018, the State of\n\nKarnataka informed this Court that the ―further process have been stalled\n\nbecause of the enactment of the new legislation and its publication in the Gazette\n\non 23 June 2018‖. On 7 August 2018, the State of Karnataka filed an interim\n\napplication seeking permission of this Court to implement the Reservation Act\n\n2018. It has been urged that contrary to what was stated by the state\n\nGovernment, there was no compliance of the decision in B K Pavitra I. In this\n\nbackground, it has been submitted that the state has undertaken an exercise to\n\noverrule B K Pavitra I which constitutes a clear usurpation of judicial power.\nPART C\n\nC Lack of compliance with Nagaraj and Jarnail\n\n44 Dr Dhavan assails the report of the Ratna Prabha Committee on the\n\nground that is was not in compliance with Nagaraj and Jarnail. Nagaraj\n\npostulates that:\n\n(i) The backlog should not extend beyond three years;\n\n(ii) Excessive reservation would invalidate the exercise of power; and\n\n(iii) There is a theory of guided power under which a failure to follow the above\n\nconditionalities would result in reverse discrimination.\n\n45 According to the submission, the decision in Nagaraj:\n\n(a) Deploys the methodology that the seventy-seventh, eighty-first, eighty-\n\nsecond and eighty-sixth amendments were only enabling and were valid.\n\nThe conditionalities for a valid exercise of the enabling power are two-fold:\n\n(i) The existence of compelling reasons namely, backwardness,\n\ninadequacy of representation and overall administrative efficiency\n\nrequiring quantifiable data; and\n\n(ii) Excessiveness, which postulates that the ceiling limit of fifty per cent\n\nis not transgressed, the creamy layer is not obliterated and\n\nreservation is not extended indefinitely.\n\n(b) The methodology of Nagaraj was approved both in I R Coelho v State of\n\nTN65 and Jarnail; and\n(2007) 2 SCC 1\nPART C\n\n(c) The decision in Jarnail, while upholding the methodology adopted in\n\nNagaraj held that there is a constitutional presumption which obviates the\n\nneed for quantifiable data on the backwardness of SCs and STs and\n\nhence that part of Nagaraj was held to be contrary to the decision in Indra\n\nSawhney. The application of the creamy layer test was held to be a\n\nrequirement for SCs and STs and other principles or applications\n\nenunciated in Nagaraj were held to be valid.\n\n46 In this background, the Ratna Prabha Committee report is assailed on the\n\nfollowing grounds:\n\n(i) The chapter on backwardness is not necessary;\n\n(ii) Inadequacy of representation is examined over 30 pages;\n\n(iii) The data collected is over 32 years in thirty one government departments;\n\n(iv) No data exists in 1986;\n\n(v) The data indicates that STs are adequately represented from 1999 to 2015\n\nbut the average of 31 years is 2.70;\n\n(vi) No data has been collected from public sector undertakings, boards,\n\ncorporations, local bodies, grant-in-aid institutions, among others, and it is\n\nassumed that the data is representative in nature;\n\n(vii) The representation in Public Works Department (―PWD‖) and Karnataka\n\nPower Transport Corporation Limited (―KPTCL‖) is adequate;\n\n(viii) The data collected is with respect to the availability of vacancies and not\n\nposts, contrary to the requirements laid out in Sabharwal‟s case;\nPART C\n\n(ix) The data is on sanctioned posts and not posts which have been filled;\n\n(x) The data is not cadre based but based on grades A, B, C and D even\n\nthough Jarnail requires the data to be on the basis of cadre;\n\n(xi) The report erroneously assumed that grades A, B, C and D correspond to\n\ncadres;\n\n(xii) The report candidly admits that ―in some departments, corporations like\n\nPWD and KPTCL there may be over representation of the percentage\n\nmandated‖;\n\n(xiii) On administrative efficiency:\n\n(a) The data is based on general considerations such as economic\n\ndevelopment;\n\n(b) The efficiencies adverted to in matters of administrative, policy and\n\nservice are general; and\n\n(c) Reliance which has been placed is on performance reports.\n\n(xiv) The state has followed a strange method of back door entry by filling up\n\nvacancies not by selection but through toppers from universities in various\n\ndepartments for gazetted grade A and B posts.\n\nD Reservation of the Bill to the President\n\n47 Dr Dhavan urged that from the counter affidavit filed by the State\n\nGovernment, it is evident that:\n\n(i) The view of the State government was that given the legislative\n\ncompetence of the state legislature, the ―Bill was not required to be\n\nreserved‖ for the assent of the President;\nPART C\n\n(ii) On 6 December 2017, the Governor of Karnataka considered it appropriate\n\nto refer the Bill to the President in view of the decision in B K Pavitra I and\n\nthe ―importance of the issue and the constitutional interpretation involved in\n\nthe matter‖ under\nArticle 200;\n\n(iv) The State government on the Bill being forwarded to the President\n\ncontinued to maintain that the Bill neither attracted the second proviso to\n\nArticle 200\nnor did it deal with a matter which was repugnant to a Union\n\nlaw on an entry falling in List III of the Seventh Schedule. Hence, the State\n\ngovernment opined that there did not appear to be any situation warranting\n\nthe reservation of the Bill for the consideration of the President. Hence, it\n\nhas been urged that it may be:\n\n(a) The reference by the Governor on 6 December 2017 to the\n\nPresident simply stated that since a constitutional interpretation was\n\nrequired, the Bill was reserved for the President; however no\n\nspecific issues were referred; and\n\n(b) The State government forwarded the Bill to the President, recording\n\nat the same time that there was no reason to refer.\n\n(v) The Union Government invited reasons for the reference to which\n\nresponses were made by the State Government in its clarification;\n\n(vi) The Governor was altogether by-passed in this process; and\n\n(vii) The Governor has the exclusive authority under\nArticle 200\non the\n\nreference and must formulate a specific reference, which was not done.\n\nThe Central Government, it was urged, cannot create a reference which\n\nhas not been made by the state.\nPART C\n\n48 In order to buttress his submissions, Dr Dhavan relied upon the decisions\n\nin\nKaiser-I-Hind Pvt Ltd v National Textile Corporation Ltd66\n, Gram\n\nPanchayat of Village Jamalpur v Malwinder Singh67 (―Gram Panchayat of\n\nVillage Jamalpur‖), Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd v State of Bihar68\n\n(―Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd‖) and Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix v\n\nDeputy Speaker Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly 69 (―Nabam\n\nRebia‖).\n\nDr Dhavan urged that:\n\n(i) There was no valid reference by the Governor in the absence of specificity\n\non the matter of reference;\n\n(ii) The State government consistently indicated that there was no reason to\n\nrefer the Bill to the President;\n\n(iii) The Union Government could not have created a reference where none\n\nexisted; and\n\n(iv) The reference was unconstitutional and the assent of the Governor was\n\nnot obtained.\n\nE Seniority including consequential seniority\n\n49 The submissions of Dr Dhavan are:\n\n(i) Seniority is determined by the Seniority Rules 1957;\n(2002) 8 SCC 182\n(1985) 3 SCC 661\n(1983) 4 SCC 45\n(2016) 8 SSC 1\nPART C\n\n(ii) The decision in Badappanavar held that there was no specific rule\n\nproviding for consequential seniority in the Seniority Rules 1957;\n\n(iii) The amendments in the Seniority Rules 1957 on 18 August 2006 did not\n\neffect any change to unsettle the decision in Badappanavar;\n\n(iv) The Reservation Act 2002 attempted to overrule Badappanavar and was\n\neventually invalidated in B K Pavitra I;\n\n(v) The Reservation Act 2018 mentions consequential seniority in its title yet\n\nSection 5 makes no reference of it and in fact reinforces the Seniority\n\nRules 1957 by implication. The reference to the Rules in Section 5 can\n\nonly be in the context of the Seniority Rules 1957 as amended. The\n\nSeniority Rules 1957 will override the administrative orders of 27 April\n\n1978;\n\n(vi) The Government Order dated 27 April 1978 specifically adverts to Rules 4\n\nor 4-A (as the case may be) of the Seniority Rules 1957;\n\n(vii) No seniority can be conveyed by filling up of backlog and creating excess\n\nor supernumerary posts; and\n\n(viii) The proviso to Section 5 would be liable to be struck down for its\n\nexcessiveness.\n\n50 In substance, Dr Dhavan‘s are as follows:\n\n(i) Every administrative action or legislation has to be Nagaraj compliant as\n\nexplained in Jarnail;\nPART C\n\n(ii) After the decision in B K Pavitra I, the State of Karnataka hurriedly\n\nenacted the Reservation Act 2018 without demonstrating any compelling\n\nnecessity;\n\n(iii) The Governor of Karnataka reserved the Bill for the President without\n\ndelineating the exact reasons for doing so. Even while forwarding the Bill,\n\nthe State government maintained that there was no reason to make a\n\nreference to the President. The queries exchanged subsequently would\n\nnot constitute a valid reference;\n\n(iv) The Ratna Prabha Committee report is flawed and does not establish\n\ninadequacy of representation and impact on administrative efficiency;\n\n(v) The Reservation Act 2018 is similar to the Reservation Act 2002 except for\n\n(i) Section 5 while mandates reservations; and (ii) Section 9 which\n\noverrules all decisions of the past and pre-empts challenges in the future;\n\n(vi) The Seniority Rules 1957 continue not to cover consequential seniority and\n\nby the repeal of the Reservation Act 2002, the decision in Badappanavar\n\ncontinues to be good law;\n\n(vii) The uncontrolled backlog is not valid;\n\n(viii) A proper exercise must be post and not vacancy based, it must be based\n\non cadres and not on groups A to D;\n\n(ix) The counter affidavit of the State admits the flaws of the process denying\n\ncurative effect to the exercise; and\n\n(x) The Reservation Act 2018 has failed to pass muster and its non-compliant\n\nwith the decisions in Nagaraj and Jarnail.\nPART C\n\n51 Mr Shekhar Naphade, learned Senior Counsel submitted that:\n\n(i) The decision in B K Pavitra I has attained finality and a subsequent\n\nchange in law cannot abrogate the principle of res judicata;\n\n(ii) As held in the decision of this Court in\nPandit M S M Sharma v Dr\n\nKrishna Sinha70\n, whether an earlier judgment is right or wrong is not\n\nmaterial to the applicability of the doctrine of res judicata;\n\n(iii) The subsequent decision in Jarnail is not a ground for review and, in\n\nany event, a review of B K Pavitra I by the state will not lie;\n\n(iv) In view of the explanation to\nOrder XLVII of the CPC\n, a reversal on a\n\nquestion of law in a subsequent decision of a superior court is not a\n\nground for review;\n\n(v) An error of law is no ground for review (\nState of West Bengal v Kamal\n\nSengupta71\n);\n\n(vi) The Reservation Act 2018 is based on a report which furnishes factual\n\ndata: this could have been furnished in the earlier round. The\n\nlegislature has taken recourse to exercise of judicial power;\n\n(vii) The provisions of the Reservation Act 2018 are virtually the same as\n\nthose of the Reservation Act 2002;\n\n(viii) The basis of legislative intervention was the collection of data: the\n\nattempt is to place fresh material before the Court to review its decision\n\nin B K Pavitra I. There is no change in law;\n\n(ix) Retrospectivity of the Reservation Act 2018 from 1978 is arbitrary;\nAIR 1960 SC 1186\n(2008) 8 SCC 612\nPART C\n\n(x) There is no change in the basis of the law. The basis is a change in the\n\nfactual matrix which is not available as a ground for review;\n\n(xi) The Ratna Prabha Committee report has collected no substantive\n\nmaterial on the impact of reservation in promotion on the efficiency of\n\nadministration;\n\n(xii) The second proviso to\nArticle 200\nand\nArticle 254 (2)\nof the Constitution\n\nare exhaustive of the constitutional power of the Governor to reserve a\n\nBill for the assent of the President;\n\n(xiii) The Ratna Prabha Committee report does not deal with the aspect of\n\ncreamy layer which had been duly considered in Jarnail;\n\n(xiv) The Ratna Prabha Committee dwelt on groups and not on cadres. The\n\ndata includes direct recruits as well as promotees, whereas the present\n\ncase is only about promotion; and\n\n(xv) Data was collected only from thirty one government departments and\n\nnot from public sector undertakings.\n\n52 Supplementing the submissions of Dr Dhavan, Mr Puneet Jain, learned\n\nCounsel appearing on the behalf of the petitioners has adverted to the following\n\nissues which arise for the consideration of this Court:\n\n(i) Section 3 of the Reservation Act 2018 only seeks to extend consequential\n\nseniority retrospectively to vacancy based roster point promotees and is\n\nnot concerned with the state exercising its enabling power to provide for\n\nreservation in promotions. The Government Order72 dated 27 April 1978 by\nG.O. No. DPAR 29 SBC 77\nPART C\n\nwhich reservation for persons belonging to SCs and STs in specified\n\ncategories of promotional posts was introduced cannot be ―justified‖ by a\n\nsatisfaction on the basis of the Ratna Prabha Committee report;\n\n(ii)\nArticle 16 (4A)\nconfers a discretion upon the state to provide for\n\nreservations in promotion with or without consequential seniority. Nagaraj\n\nmandates that there have to exist compelling reasons and the satisfaction\n\nof the state before exercise of its powers under\nArticle 16 (4A).\nIn view of\n\nthe decision in Panneer Selvam, automatic conferment of consequential\n\nseniority can no longer be sustained; and\n\n(iii) The fact that the eighty-fifth amendment has been made retrospective from\n\n17 June 1995 cannot enable the state to make a provision for the first time\n\nby exercising powers retrospectively and consequently taking away vested\n\nrights which legitimately accrued upon the general category employees.\n\nC.2 Submissions for the respondents and intervenors\n\n53 Appearing for the State of Karnataka, Mr Basava Prabhu S Patil, learned\n\nSenior Counsel submitted thus:\n\nA The basis of B K Pavitra I has been altered\n\n(i) The Reservation Act 2018 has taken away the basis of the judgment in B\n\nK Pavitra I and the protection of seniority with retrospective effect which is\n\npermissible in law:\nPART C\n\n(a) The Reservation Act 2018 does not seek to overrule or nullify\n\nsimpliciter the decision in B K Pavitra I. The law was enacted to\n\nprovide consequential seniority for roster point promotees after\n\ncollecting data showing the existence of the compelling reasons of :\n\n(i) backwardness; (ii) inadequacy of representation; and (iii) overall\n\nefficiency. Hence, the Reservation Act 2018 removes the basis of\n\nthe decision in B K Pavitra I;\n\n(b) The state legislature is competent to enact a law with retrospective\n\nor retroactive operation. The legislative competence of the State\n\nLegislature to enact law is traceable to\nArticle 16 (4A).\nMerely\n\nbecause the legislation confers seniority with effect from 1978, will\n\nnot lead to its invalidation (Cheviti Venkanna Yadav v State of\n\nTelangana73 (―Cheviti Venkanna Yadav‖), Utkal Contractors &\n\nJoinery (P) Ltd v State of Orissa74 (―Utkal Contractors and\n\nJoinery (P) Ltd‖) and\nState of Himachal Pradesh v Narain\n\nSingh75 (―Narain Singh‖\n);\n\n(c) Sections 3 and 4 of the Reservation Act 2018 came into operation\n\non 17 June 1995, on which date the seventy-seventh and eighty-fifth\n\namendments to the Constitution came into effect, thereby enabling\n\nreservations to be made in promotion together with consequential\n\nseniority. The Reservation Act 2018 protects consequential seniority\n\naccorded from 27 April 1978 (the date of the reservation order) in\n(2017) 1 SCC 283\n(1987) Supp. SCC 751\n(2009) 13 SCC 165\nPART C\n\nlight of the data collected which shows the inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation;\n\n(d) In terms of the decision in Virpal Singh, the catch-up rule was to be\n\napplied with effect from 10 February 1995 (i.e. the date of the\n\njudgment in Sabharwal). According to the decision in Ajit Singh II,\n\npromotions granted prior to 1 March 1996 without following the\n\ncatch-up rule are protected. Badappanavar protects the promotions\n\nof reserved candidates based on consequential seniority which took\n\nplace before 1 March 1996;\n\n(e) While judicial review allows courts to declare a statute as\n\nunconstitutional if it transgresses constitutional limits, courts are\n\nprecluded from inquiring into the propriety or wisdom underlying the\n\nexercise of the legislative power. The motives of the legislature in\n\nenacting a law are incapable of being judicially evaluated; and\n\n(f) Seniority is not a vested or an accrued right and hence it is open for\n\nthe legislature to enact a law for dealing with it.\n\n(ii) The Reservation Act 2018 is not of the same genre of legislation dealt with\n\nin the decision of Madan Mohan Pathak:\n\n(a) Madan Mohan Pathak involved a challenge by the employees of\n\nthe Life Insurance Corporation to the constitutional validity of a\n\nParliamentary law which attempted to render ineffective a settlement\n\nwith employees for the payment of bonus. The judgment does not\nPART C\n\ndeal with a case where the basis of the invalidity of a legislation\n\nnoticed in a judicial decision is taken away by a subsequent law;\n\nand\n\n(b) Madan Mohan Pathak in fact, notices that in the case of a\n\ndeclaratory judgment holding an action to be invalid, validating\n\nlegislation to remove the defect is permissible.\n\n(iii) The collection of data by the State must demonstrate the presence of\n\ncompelling reasons namely, (a) inadequacy of representation; (b)\n\nbackwardness; and (c) overall administrative efficiency as enunciated in\n\nNagaraj and B K Pavitra I;\n\n(iv) The decision in Indra Sawhney holds that the question as to whether a\n\nbackward class of citizens is not adequately represented in the services\n\nunder the state is a matter of subjective satisfaction;\n\n(v) Nagaraj also notices the position that there is a presumption that the state\n\nis in the best position to define and measure merit and that there is no\n\nfixed yardstick to identify and measure the three factors on which\n\nquantifiable data has to be collected;\n\n(vi) The decision in Jarnail also holds that the test of determining the\n\nadequacy of representation in promotional posts is left wisely to the states;\n\nand\nPART C\n\n(vii) The Reservation Act 2018 was enacted after the State was satisfied about\n\nthe existence of the three compelling reasons.\n\nB The Ratna Prabha Committee has dealt with all the three facets\n\nconstituting the „compelling reasons‟:\n\n1 Backwardness\n\n(i) The decision in Jarnail has clarified that there is no requirement of collecting\n\nquantifiable data on the backwardness of SCs and STs. The observation in\n\nNagaraj is contrary to the larger Bench decision in Indra Sawhney.\n\n(ii) Yet, in any event, the Ratna Prabha Committee considered the\n\nbackwardness of SCs and STs in view of the dictum in Nagaraj which then\n\nheld the field. The Committee after carrying out the exercise came to the\n\nconclusion that the requirement of backwardness is satisfied.\n\n2 Inadequacy of representation\n\n(i) Chapter II of the Ratna Prabha Committee report considered the\n\ninadequacy of representation and records a summary of its conclusions in\n\nparagraphs 2.5 and 2.6;\n\n(ii) It is misleading to assert that the State did not collect cadre wise data.\n\nPara 2.4.1 indicates that the government took into account the data for\n\ngroups A, B, C and D to draw a conclusion about the inadequacy of\n\nrepresentation;\nPART C\n\n(iii) The decisions in Indra Sawhney and Sabharwal are clear in postulating\n\nthat persons belonging to the SCs and STs who are appointed against\n\ngeneral category posts/vacancies are not to be reckoned for ascertaining\n\nover representation; and\n\n(iv) It is a matter of common experience that for most of the group D posts\n\nsuch as municipal sweepers, only persons belonging to SCs and STs\n\napply. Over representation in group D posts which results from general\n\ncategory candidates keeping away from them is no ground to deny\n\npromotion to group D employees recruited against the reserved category.\n\n3 Administrative efficiency\n\n(i) Para 3.12 of Chapter III of the Ratna Prabha Committee report has\n\nconsidered all relevant aspects before coming to the conclusion that\n\nreservations in promotion do not affect administrative efficiency;\n\n(ii) Promotions are made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. [Rule 19(3)(a) of\n\nthe Rules 1977] Only those candidates who fulfil the criteria of\n\nmerit/suitability are promoted based on seniority. Since this criterion is\n\napplicable even in respect of roster promotions, the efficiency of\n\nadministration is not adversely impacted; and\n\n(iii) On promotion, a candidate is required to serve a statutory period of\n\nofficiation before being confirmed in service. This applies to all candidates\n\nincluding roster point promotees and ensures that the efficiency of\n\nadministration is not adversely affected.\nPART C\n\nC The challenge on the ground that the Reservation Act 2018 does not\n\nexclude the benefit of consequential seniority in respect of the creamy\n\nlayer in terms of the decision in Jarnail is baseless:\n\n(i) Creamy layer as a concept can be applied only at the entry level or at\n\nappointment and has no application while granting reservations in\n\npromotion and allowing for consequential seniority. The Reservation Act\n\n2018 provides only for consequential seniority and the extent of\n\nreservation granted to SCs and STs at the entry level/ in appointment is\n\nnot under challenge;\n\n(ii) Even assuming that the concept of creamy layer can be applied at the\n\nstage of promotion, it is inapplicable to the conferment of consequential\n\nseniority. Consequential seniority is not an additional benefit but a\n\nconsequence of promotion;\n\n(iii) Appointment to a post or progression in career based on promotion cannot\n\nbe treated as acquisition of creamy layer status. In fact, the decision in\n\nJarnail makes it clear that the concept of creamy layer applies only to the\n\nentry stage;\n\n(iv) Nagaraj does not hold that the exclusion of the creamy layer is a pre-\n\ncondition for the exercise of the enabling power under\nArticle 16 (4A)\nfor\n\nproviding promotion or consequential seniority;\n\n(v) In the decision in B K Pavitra I, the challenge to the Reservation Act 2002\n\nwas accepted on the ground that the State had not carried out an exercise\n\nfor determining inadequacy of representation, backwardness and overall\nPART C\n\nefficiency of administration. B K Pavitra I did not accept the plea of the\n\napplicability of creamy lawyer principle to consequential seniority; and\n\n(vi) Under the Reservation Order 1978, reservations in promotion are\n\nrestricted up to the lowest category of class I post.\n\nD There is no basis in the challenge that the Reservation Act 2018 does\n\nnot meet the proportionality test and results in over representation.\n\n(i) In view of the Reservation Order 1999 providing that reservation in\n\npromotion in favour of SCs and STs shall continue only till their\n\nrepresentation reaches 15 per cent and 3 per cent respectively, it is\n\nensured that there is no over representation; and\n\n(ii) Since the Reservation Act 2018 provides only for consequential seniority\n\nand not for reservation in appointment or promotion, it cannot be asserted\n\nthat reservation for the purpose of seniority is vacancy-based and not post-\n\nbased, contrary to the decision in Sabharwal. Reservations in promotion\n\nare provided by the Government Order 1978 which provides for roster\n\npoint promotion and not roster point seniority. The Government Order\n\ndated 13 April 1999 provides for making promotions (after the existing\n\nbacklog is filled) in favour of SCs and STs by maintaining their\n\nrepresentation to the extent of 15 per cent and 3 per cent of the total\n\nworking strength (and not vacancies).\nPART C\n\nE There was no constitutional infirmity in the Governor of Karnataka\n\nhaving reserved the Reservation Act 2018 for the consideration of the\n\nPresident.\n\nThe Governor in reserving the Bill for consideration of the President acted in\n\npursuance of the provisions of\nArticle 200\nof the Constitution. The Governor may\n\nunder\nArticle 200 (i)\ndeclare assent to a Bill; or (ii) declare the withholding of\n\nassent; or (iii) reserve a Bill for consideration of the President. The power of the\n\nGovernor to reserve a Bill for consideration of the President is not subject to the\n\nexistence of a repugnancy under\nArticle 254 (2).\nThe action of the Governor is\n\nnon-justiciable. (Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd)\n\nF The assent of the Governor is not contemplated once the President has\n\ngiven assent to a Bill.\n\nNeither\nArticle 200\nnor\nArticle 201\ncontemplates that the Bill should be presented\n\nagain before the Governor after it has been assented to by the President.\nSection\n\n5(1)(iv)\nof the Karnataka General Clauses Act 1899 postulates that an Act\n\npassed by the Karnataka legislature shall come into operation on the day on\n\nwhich the assent of the Governor or, as the case may be, of the President is\n\ngranted and is first published in the Official Gazette. Hence, once the assent of\n\nthe President is granted, the necessity of a further assent by the Governor is\n\nobviated.\n\nG The submission that in Karnataka Power Transport Corporation Limited,\n\nas a consequence of the reservation in seniority in the cadre of\nPART C\n\nSuperintending Engineer and Engineer-in-Chief, there was over\n\nrepresentation for SCs and ST between 2005 and 2016 is erroneous.\n\n(i) There is no reservation for promotion to the posts of Superintending\n\nEngineer and Engineer-in-Chief in KPTCL. Reservation in promotion and\n\nconsequential seniority is available only up to the post of Assistant\n\nExecutive Engineer. In fact, if consequential seniority were not to be\n\ngranted on promotion up to the post of Assistant Executive Engineer, there\n\nwould be excessive under-representation of reserved category candidates.\n\nThe Ratna Prabha Committee report, in paragraph 2.4, took note of the\n\ntotal number of officials/employees working in thirty one government\n\ndepartments of the State Government. It noted that 80.35 per cent of the\n\nsanctioned posts are concentrated in six major Government departments\n\nnamely; Education, Home, Health, Revenue, Judicial and Finance. The\n\ndata pertaining to thirty one government departments was taken in the\n\ntotality to analyse and assess the adequacy of representation. The data of\n\nsmaller departments may not be representative of the State Civil Services\n\nas a whole.\n\nOn the above grounds, it was urged that the challenge to the Reservation Act\n\n2018 must fail.\n\n54 Ms Indira Jaising76, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nintervenors (Karnataka SC/ST Engineer‘s Welfare Association) contended that\nIn I.A. No. 90623 of 2018 in W.P. (C) No. 764 of 2018\nPART C\n\nthe Reservation Act 2018 is constitutionally valid. Ms Jaising urged the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n(i) The decisions of this Court in\nState of Kerala v N M Thomas77 (―N M\n\nThomas‖) and Nagaraj\naffirmed that\nArticle 16 (4)\nis an emphatic\n\ndeclaration of\nArticle 16 (1).\nThe principle of ‗proportional equality‘ entails\n\nsubstantive equality which is reflected in affirmative action to remedy\n\ninjustice to SCs, STs and Other Backward Classes78. Social justice is\n\nconcerned with the distribution of benefits and burdens. The Reservation\n\nAct 2018, in providing for consequential seniority, furthers the vision of\n\nsubstantive equality and is valid;\n\n(ii) Affirmative action under\nArticle 15 (4)\nand reservation under\nArticle 16 (4)\n\nof the Constitution are intended to ensure that all sections of the society\n\nare represented equally in services under the state. The Reservation Act\n\n2018 underlies this salient objective and furthers the promotion of the\n\ninterests of the SCs, STs and other weaker sections as stipulated in\nArticle\nof the Constitution;\n\n(iii)\nArticle 16 (4A)\nis an enabling provision which empowers the State to frame\n\nrules or enact a legislation granting reservations in promotions with\n\nconsequential seniority subject to the fulfilment of the conditions\nlaid down\n\nin\nNagaraj and modified by Jarnail. Following the decision in Jarnail, the\n\nstate is required to show data only on the inadequacy of representation\n\nand efficiency of administration. The State of Karnataka, in exercise of the\n\nenabling power under\nArticle 16 (4A)\nenacted the Reservation Act 2018 in\n(1976) 2 SCC 310\nOBCs\nPART C\n\ncompliance with the conditions precedent to the exercise of the power\n\nstipulated in that Article;\n\n(iv) The decision in Sabharwal lays down that in determining the inadequacy\n\nof representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts, the state may take\n\nthe total population of a particular class and its representation in the\n\nservice. The State has studied the extent of reservation in posts for SCs\n\nand STs in a ‗group‘ which is a collection of cadres. Hence, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the state failed to collect quantifiable data on the representation\n\nof SCs and STs in promotional posts. Without the grant of consequential\n\nseniority, the percentage of reservation will not reach the prescribed\n\npercentage;\n\n(v) No statistical studies have been provided to show that the grant of\n\nconsequential seniority has led to the lowering of efficiency in\n\nadministration. It cannot be presumed that the appointment of SCs and\n\nSTs will lead to a lowering of efficiency as at the individual level, all\n\nindividuals belonging to SCs and STs must also achieve the minimum\n\nbenchmark of ‗good‘;\n\n(vi) The Reservation Act 2002 was struck down on the basis of the failure of\n\nthe state to collect quantifiable data. The Reservation Act 2018 has been\n\nenacted on the basis of data collected and studied in the Ratna Prabha\n\nCommittee report. Hence, the basis of the decision in B K Pavitra I has\n\nbeen removed. Additionally, no mandamus was issued in B K Pavitra I;\n\n(vii) The collection of data required to be carried out by the State is a matter of\n\nsocial science and is carried out by experts. Data collection is both\nPART C\n\nqualitative and quantitative. As long as the methodology adopted by the\n\nstate is scientifically sound, the assessment of the data collected is the\n\nprerogative of the state. The court may intervene in judicial review only\n\nwhen there is a complete absence of data or if the data relied on is\n\nirrelevant; and\n\n(viii) The principles\nlaid down by\nthis Court in Indra Sawhney on the exclusion\n\nof the creamy layer apply only to OBCs and cannot extend to SCs and\n\nSTs. No question arose in Nagaraj on the exclusion of the creamy layer in\n\nrespect of SCs and STs. Hence, the decision is not an authority for the\n\nprinciple that the states are bound to exclude the creamy layer in respect\n\nof SCs and STs. The decision of this Court in Jarnail dealt with the\n\ncompetence of Parliament to enact a law in relation to the creamy layer\n\nand did not lay down a general proposition on its exclusion. The concept of\n\ncreamy layer, if applicable, can only be applied at the entry level and not in\n\npromotions.\n\n55 Mr Dinesh Dwivedi79, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nintervenor (Karnataka SC/ST Engineers‘ Welfare Association), urged the\n\nfollowing submissions:\n\n(i) The decision in Nagaraj was concerned with whether reservation in\n\npromotion as inserted in\nArticle 16 (4A)\nby the Constitution (Seventy-\n\nseventh Amendment) Act 1995 and the enabling provision for the grant of\n\nconsequential seniority under\nArticle 16 (4A)\ninserted by the\nConstitution\n\n(Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act\n2001 violated the basic structure of the\nIn I.A. No. 102966 of 2018 in W. P. (C) No. 791 of 2018\nPART C\n\nConstitution. The decision in Nagaraj was concerned with reservations in\n\npromotion and did not equate reservation in promotion with the grant of\n\nconsequential seniority. In this view, the four controlling factors, namely (i)\n\nbackwardness; (ii) adequacy of representation; (iii) elimination of the\n\ncreamy layer; and (iv) efficiency of administration have relevance only to\n\nthe exercise of the enabling power under\nArticle 16 (4A)\nfor making\n\nreservation in promotion and not the exercise of the enabling power to\n\ngrant consequential seniority;\n\n(ii) Reservation in promotion was introduced in the State of Karnataka by the\n\nGovernment Order dated 27 April 1978 and continues to be in operation.\n\nThe Reservation Act 2018 stipulates the grant of consequential seniority\n\nwhich is premised on the prior existence and operation of reservation in\n\npromotion. Absent a challenge to the Government Order dated 27 April\n\n1978 in the present proceedings, the petitioner is precluded from\n\nchallenging the grant of consequential seniority in the Reservation Act\n\n2018;\n\n(iii) Consequential seniority is nothing but the normal rule of seniority which\n\naccords seniority to roster point promotees from the date of their\n\nsubstantive promotion. The catch-up rule is an exception to the normal rule\n\nof seniority. Prior to the decision in Indra Sawhney, accelerated seniority\n\nto roster point promotees existed in the State of Karnataka with the\n\napplication of the continuous officiation rule. This is supported by Rule 2(b)\n\nof the 1957 Rules. Para III (d) of the Government Order dated 27 April\n\n1978 provided for the application of the catch-up rule only in a limited\nPART C\n\nmanner. Rule 4 is restricted in its application to appointments made on the\n\nsame day which implies that in the absence of its application to a given\n\ncase, consequential seniority must be granted;\n\n(iv) The decision in Virpal Singh concerned a rule that specifically provided for\n\nthe application of the catch-up rule in a departure from the normal rule of\n\nseniority. This Court held that a state may prescribe either consequential\n\nseniority based on continuous officiation or the catch-up rule of seniority in\n\ncase of roster point promotions. A harmonious reading of\nArticles 14\nand\n\n16(1)\nof the Constitution does not stipulate that the catch-up rule must\n\napply in the case of roster point promotions. Thus, a balancing of\nArticles\n, 16(1)\nand\n16(4)\nof the Constitution denotes that the catch-up rule is not\n\nmandatory. The decisions of this Court in Ajit Singh I, Ajit Singh II and\n\nBadappanavar, in holding to the contrary, have been expressly overruled\n\nby the seventy-seventh and the eighty-fifth amendments to the\n\nConstitution, following which the principles enunciated in Virpal Singh\n\ncontinue to govern the field. The eighty-fifth amendment was intended to\n\nmake consequential seniority a constitutional principle and revive\n\nconsequential seniority as the normal rule of seniority;\n\n(v) The principles enunciated in Virpal Singh are fortified by the decision in\n\nNagaraj which held that the catch-up rule and consequential seniority are\n\nprinciples of service jurisprudence and cannot be elevated to a\n\nconstitutional status. The discretion to choose between consequential\n\nseniority and catch-up vests with the state. The Reservation Act 2018, in\nPART C\n\nstipulating for consequential seniority, is a valid exercise of discretion by\n\nthe State; and\n\n(vi) In the alternative, the tests\nlaid down by\nthe four controlling factors in\n\nNagaraj and Jarnail have been satisfied prior to the enactment of the\n\nReservation Act 2018. The satisfaction of the state in this regard cannot be\n\nsubjected to review by this Court.\n\n56 Mr Lakshminarayana, learned Senior Counsel has submitted thus:\n\n(i) The issue as to whether reservation under\nArticle 16 (4A)\ncan be provided\n\nby an executive order was answered in the affirmative in the judgment of\n\nJustice BP Jeevan Ready speaking for a plurality of judges in Indra\n\nSawhney. The word ‗provision‘ in\nArticle 16 (4)\nwas interpreted in contrast\n\nwith the word ‗law‘ in clauses (3) and (5) of\nArticle 16.\nThe word ‗any‘ and\n\nthe word ‗provision‘ in\nArticle 16 (4)\nmust be given their due meaning.\n\nArticle 16 (4)\nis exhaustive as a special provision in favour of the backward\n\nclass of citizens. Backward classes having been classified by the\n\nConstitution as a class deserving special treatment and the Constitution\n\nitself having specified the nature of the special treatment, it should be\n\npresumed that no further classification or special treatment is permissible\n\nin their favour outside\nArticle 16 (4).\nIn light of the decision in Indra\n\nSawhney, it is now a settled principle that a provision for reservation can\n\nbe made by the legislature, by statutory rules and by executive orders;\n\n(ii) Provisions for reservation in promotions were introduced in Karnataka by\n\nthe Government Order dated 27 April 1978 on the basis of the inadequacy\nPART C\n\nof representation of SCs and STs in public services under\nArticle 16 (4).\n\nAfter the report on the inadequacy of representation dated 30 August\n\n1979, first and second roster points were reserved for SCs and STs. The\n\nprinciple of consequential seniority is adopted by clause (vii) of the\n\nGovernment Order dated 27 April 1978 and clause (d) of the Government\n\nOrder dated 1 June 1978;\n\n(iii) Clause (vii) of the Government Order dated 27 April 1978 as it originally\n\nstood provided that inter se seniority amongst persons promoted ―on any\n\noccasion‖ shall be determined under Rules 4 and 4 (A) of the Seniority\n\nRules 1957;\n\n(iv) The words ―on any occasion‖ in clause (vii) were amended by clause (d) of\n\nthe Government Order dated 1 June 1978 so that the determination of\n\nseniority among reserved promotees and general candidates on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit shall ―on each occasion‖ be fixed under Rule 4 of\n\nthe Seniority Rules 1957;\n\n(v) The substitution of the expression ―on any occasion‖ with the expression\n\n―on each occasion‖ denotes the intention of the government to provide\n\nconsequential seniority to reserved category candidates promoted on the\n\nbasis of roster;\n\n(vi) The legislature enacted provisions pertaining to the policy of reservation in\n\npromotion in the State Civil Services and Public Sector Undertakings as\n\nfollows :\nPART C\n\n(a) The Rules 1977 including the proviso to Rule 8, upheld by this Court\n\nin Bhakta Ramegowda;\n\n(b) The Karnataka Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other\n\nBackward Classes (Reservation of Appointment etc.,) Act 1990;\n\n(c) The Karnataka Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other\n\nBackward Classes (Reservation of Appointment etc.,) Rules 1992;\n\nand\n\n(d) The Karnataka State Civil Services (Unfilled Vacancies Reserved for\n\nthe persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\n\nTribes) (Special Recruitment) Rules 2001.\n\nThe above provisions were followed by the Reservation Acts of 2002 and 2017.\n\n(vii) With effect from 1 April 1992, the State of Karnataka inserted the proviso\n\nto Rule 8 in the Rules 1977 which reads as follows:\n\n―8. Provision for reservation of appointments or posts.-\n\nAppointments or posts shall be reserved for the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other\nBackward Classes to such extent and in such manner as may\nbe specified by the government under clause (4) of\nArticle 16\n\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nProviso to Rule 8\n[Provided that, notwithstanding anything in the rules of\nRecruitment specially made in respect of any Service or Post,\nthe backlog vacancies in the promotional quota shall be\ndetermined and implemented with effect from 27th April,1978.\n\nNote.– The backlog vacancy means the extent of the number\nof vacancies available under the roster system up to the level\nof lowest category in Group-A post calculated from 27th April,\n1978.].‖\nProviso inserted by GSR 64, dated 01.04.1992 w.e.f. 01.04.1992\nPART C\n\nThe above Rule was upheld in Bhakta Ramegowda;\n\n(viii) The Government Order dated 24 June 1997 provided additional roster\n\npoints to cover up backlog promotional roster points, both in promotion and\n\ndirect recruitment. Clauses (iv) and (v) of para 8 of the Government Order\n\ndated 24 June 1997 reads as follows :\n\n―Clause (IV).\n\nAfter effecting review of promotion and adjustment and\nfitment as indicated in item (iii) above, if some more persons\nbelonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes who\nhave already been promoted against backlog cannot get\nadjusted due to want of adequate number of vacancies as per\nthe aforesaid roster points, such persons shall be adjusted\nand fitted in accordance with the procedure specified in item\n\n(iii) while effecting promotion in respect of future vacancies.\n\nUntil such time, shall be continued against supernumerary\nposts to be created by the concerned Administrative\nDepartment. For this purpose, the Secretaries to Government\nare hereby delegated the power to create supernumerary\nposts presuming the concurrence of Finance Department and\nto that extent the Government Order No. FD 1 TFP 96, dated\n10.07.1996, shall be deemed to have been modified\naccordingly.\n\nClause (V)\n\nWhile adjusting and fitting promote[e]s as indicated in item (iii)\nand (iv) above, the inter-se seniority among the General\ncategory, the scheduled caste category and the scheduled\ntribe category shall be determined in accordance with rule 4\nor rule 4 A as the case may be, of the Karnataka Government\nServants Seniority Rules 1957. The roster points are meant\nonly for calculating the number of vacancies that become\navailable for the different categories on each occasion and\nthey do not determine the seniority.‖\n\nThe above clauses reiterated the purpose of assessing inter se seniority\n\nafter promotion of roster promotees in reckoning consequential seniority\n\namong two groups.\nPART C\n\n(ix) The State Government is entitled to prescribe the percentage of\n\nreservation based on the total population of a particular backward class\n\nand its representation in the services of the State under\nArticle 16 (4).\n\nOnce the prescribed percentage of reservations is determined, the\n\nnumerical test of adequacy is satisfied. The percentage of reservation is\n\nthe desired representation of the backward classes in the state services\n\nand is consistent with the demographic estimate, based on the proportion\n\nworked out in relation to their population;\n\n(x) The operation of the roster points and filling of the cadre strength ensures\n\nthat the reservation remains within the limit of 50 per cent;\n\n(xi) Reserved candidates who have been appointed or promoted on merit as\n\ngeneral candidates cannot be included in calculating adequacy of\n\nrepresentation of backward classes in operating the roster points. Only\n\nreserved candidates promoted against roster points are to be taken into\n\naccount in considering the adequacy of representation;\n\n(xii) A cadre includes different grades and reservation can be provided in\n\ndifferent grades within the cadre. The reservation policy contained in the\n\nGovernment Order dated 27 April 1978 has been re-issued on 17 April\n\n1993 and 11 May 1993 after the decision in Indra Sawhney;\n\n(xiii) Both clauses (1) and (4) of\nArticle 16\noperate in the same field. Both are\n\ndirected towards achieving equality of opportunity in services under the\n\nState. The formation of opinion by the State on the adequacy of\n\nrepresentation is a matter of subjective satisfaction and the test is whether\nPART C\n\nthere was some material before the State to justify its opinion. In the\n\nexercise of judicial review, the court would extend due deference to the\n\njudgment and discretion of the executive. Even if there are some errors on\n\nthe part of the State Government, that would not in any way result in the\n\ninvalidation of the entire exercise;\n\n(xiv) Efficiency of administration means governance which provides responsive\n\nservice to the people. Merit alone is not a component of efficiency. Once\n\nan employee is promoted, efficiency is judged on the basis of the annual\n\nconfidential reports;\n\n(xv) A curative legislation does not constitute an encroachment on judicial\n\npower by the State Legislature. Similarly, it is open to the legislature to\n\nenact a legislation both with retrospective and prospective effect;\n\n(xvi) Judicial review cannot extend to examine the adequacy of the material\n\navailable before the President and unless, there is a situation involving a\n\nfraud on power or conduct actuated by oblique motive, the court would not\n\nintervene;\n\n(xvii) The principle of creamy layer has no application to in-service candidates;\n\nand\n\n(xviii) The State having rectified the lacuna which was pointed out in B K Pavitra\n\nI, by carrying out the exercise of data collection, the opinion formed by the\n\nState after analysing the data lies in its subjective satisfaction. The\n\nreservation policy dated 27 April 1978 which introduced provisions for\nPART C\n\nreservations in promotions for SCs and STs in public services has\n\ncontinued until date without interruption.\n\n57 Mr Nidhesh Gupta, learned Senior Counsel urged the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\n(i) The phrase ‗in the opinion of the state‘ in\nArticle 16(4)\nof the Constitution\n\nindicates that the issue with regard to adequacy of representation is within\n\nthe subjective satisfaction of the state. The role of the court is limited to\n\nexamining whether the opinion formed by the government was on the\n\nbasis of data available with it. While the existence of circumstances\n\nrequiring state action may be reviewed, the opinion formed is outside the\n\npurview of judicial review. These propositions have been accepted in the\n\ndecisions of this Court in Indra Sawhney, Barium Chemicals Ltd. v\n\nCompany Law Board81 (―Barium Chemicals Ltd.‖),\nRohtas Industries v\n\nS D Agarwal82\nand\nRustom Cavasjee Cooper v Union of India83\n;\n\n(ii) The expression ‗to any class or classes of posts‘ in\nArticle 16(4)\nmakes it\n\nabundantly clear that the phrase refers to a ‗class‘ or ‗group‘ and not a\n\ncadre. The use of the word ‗services‘ in the phrase ‗services under the\n\nstate‘ in\nArticle 16 (4A)\nsupports this contention. The decisions in\n\nSabharwal and Nagaraj clarify that cadre strength is to be applied in the\n\noperation of the roster. The reference to ‗entire cadre strength‘ in\n\nSabharwal adverted to the fact that the entire cadre strength should be\n\ntaken into account in determining whether reservation up to the quota limit\nAIR 1967 SC 295\n(1969) 1 SCC 325\n(1970) 1 SCC 248\nPART C\n\nhas been reached. In this view, ‗entire cadre strength‘ is the reference\n\npoint to (i) ascertain the position of representation in the entire service; (ii)\n\ndetermine whether reservation up to the quota limit has been reached in\n\nthe application of the roster; and (iii) the cadre strength has been applied in\n\nthe operation of the roster. It was urged that if the percentages were\n\ncalculated on the basis of vacancies, the actual appointments made may\n\nexceed the prescribed quota. Reliance has been placed on the decisions\n\nof this Court in Indra Sawhney, Nagaraj, and Jarnail;\n\n(iii) The decision in Indra Sawhney does not deal with SCs and STs in regard\n\nto the creamy layer principle. In any case, even if the principle applies to\n\nSCs and STs, it would only be applicable at the stage of appointments and\n\nnot for promotional posts; and\n\n(iv) The percentages in the PWD which are marginally above the stipulated\n\nquota are by way of including those reserved category candidates who\n\nwere selected on general merit. This is contrary to the law\nlaid down by\n\nthis Court in Sabharwal, Indra Sawhney and Ritesh Sah v Y L Yamul84.\n\n58 The rival submissions now fall for consideration.\n\n59 Other Counsel, who argued and submitted their written submissions, have\n\nwith certain nuances, reiterated similar arguments.\n(1996) 3 SCC 253\nPART D\n\nD Assent to the Bill\n\n60 Besides the Governor, the legislatures of the States consist of a bicameral\n\nlegislature for some States and a unicameral legislature for others.85\nArticle 200\nis the provision which enunciates the power of the Governor to\n\nassent to a Bill, withhold assent or reserve a Bill for considering of the President:\n\n―200. When a Bill has been passed by the Legislative\nAssembly of a State or, in the case of a State having a\nLegislative Council, has been passed by both Houses of the\nLegislature of the State, it shall be presented to the Governor\nand the Governor shall declare either that he assents to the\nBill or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves\nthe Bill for the consideration of the President:\n\nProvided that the Governor may, as soon as possible after\nthe presentation to him of the Bill for assent, return the Bill if it\nis not a Money Bill together with a message requesting that\nthe House or Houses will reconsider the Bill or any specified\nprovisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the\ndesirability of introducing any such amendments as he may\nrecommend in his message and, when a Bill is so returned,\nthe House or Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly,\nand if the Bill is passed again by the House or Houses with or\nwithout amendment and presented to the Governor for\nassent, the Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom:\n\nProvided further that the Governor shall not assent to, but\nshall reserve for the consideration of the President, any Bill\nwhich in the opinion of the Governor would, if it became law,\nso derogate from the powers of the High Court as to\nendanger the position which that Court is by this Constitution\ndesigned to fill.‖\nArticle 168.\n(1) For every State there shall be a Legislature which shall consist of the Governor, and—\n\n(a) in the States of [Andhra Pradesh], Bihar, [Madhya Pradesh], [Maharashtra], [Karnataka], [[Tamil Nadu,\nTelangana]] [and Uttar Pradesh], two Houses;\n\n(b) in other States, one House.\n\n(2) Where there are two Houses of the Legislature of a State, one shall be known as the Legislative Council\nand the other as the Legislative Assembly, and where there is only one House, it shall be known as the\nLegislative Assembly.\nPART D\n\nArticle 201\ndeals with what is to happen when the Governor reserves a Bill for the\n\nconsideration of the President.\n\n―201. When a Bill is reserved by a Governor for the\nconsideration of the President, the President shall declare\neither that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent\ntherefrom:\n\nProvided that, where the Bill is not a Money Bill, the President\nmay direct the Governor to return the Bill to the House or, as\nthe case may be, the Houses of the Legislature of the State\ntogether with such a message as is mentioned in the first\nproviso to\narticle 200\nand, when a Bill is so returned, the\nHouse or Houses shall reconsider it accordingly within a\nperiod of six months from the date of receipt of such message\nand, if it is again passed by the House or Houses with or\nwithout amendment, it shall be presented again to the\nPresident for his consideration.‖\n\nUpon a Bill being passed by the Houses of the legislature (or by the sole House\n\nwhere there is only a legislative assembly), it has to be presented to the\n\nGovernor. The Governor can (i) assent to the Bill; (ii) withhold assent; or (iii)\n\nreserve the Bill for the consideration of the President.\n\n62 Where a Bill is not a Money Bill, the Governor may return the Bill for\n\nreconsideration upon which the House or Houses, as the case may be, will\n\nreconsider the desirability of introducing the amendments which the Governor\n\nhas recommended. If the Bill is passed again by the House (or Houses as the\n\ncase may be), the Governor cannot thereafter withhold assent. The second\n\nproviso to\nArticle 200\nstipulates that the Governor must not assent to a Bill but\n\nnecessarily reserve it for the consideration of the President if the Bill upon being\n\nenacted would derogate from the powers of the High Court in a manner that\nPART D\n\nendangers its position under the Constitution. Save and except for Bills falling\n\nwithin the description contained in the second proviso (where the Governor must\n\nreserve the Bill for consideration of the President), a discretion is conferred upon\n\nthe Governor to follow one of the courses of action enunciated in the substantive\n\npart of\nArticle 200.\nAside from Bills which are covered by the second proviso,\n\nwhere the Governor is obliged to reserve the Bill for the consideration of the\n\nPresident, the substantive part of\nArticle 200\ndoes not indicate specifically, the\n\ncircumstances in which the Governor may reserve a Bill for the consideration of\n\nthe President. The Constitution has entrusted this discretion to the Governor. The\n\nnature and scope of the discretionary power of the Governor to act independent\n\nof, or, contrary to aid and advice of Council of Ministers under\nArticle 163\nwas\n\ndiscussed in Nabam Rebia, Justice J S Khehar (as the learned Chief Justice\n\nthen was) held thus:\n\n―154. We are, therefore, of the considered view that insofar as\nthe exercise of discretionary powers vested with the Governor\nis concerned, the same is limited to situations, wherein a\nconstitutional provision expressly so provides that the\nGovernor should act in his own discretion. Additionally, a\nGovernor can exercise his functions in his own discretion, in\nsituations where an interpretation of the constitutional\nprovision concerned, could not be construed otherwise…‖86\n\nJustice Dipak Misra (as the learned judge then was), observed thus:\n\n―375. …The Governor is expected to function in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Constitution (and the history behind\nthe enactment of its provisions), the law and the rules\nregulating his functions. It is easy to forget that the Governor\nis a constitutional or formal head—nevertheless like\neverybody else, he has to play the game in accordance with\nthe rules of the game—whether it is in relation to the\nSupra 69 at page 159\nPART D\n\nExecutive (aid and advice of the Council of Ministers) or the\nLegislature (Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of\nthe Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly). This is not to\nsay that the Governor has no powers—he does, but these too\nare delineated by the Constitution either specifically or by\nnecessary implication…‖87\n\n63 The framers carefully eschewed defining the circumstances in which the\n\nGovernor may reserve a Bill for the consideration of the President. By its very\n\nnature the conferment of the power cannot be confined to specific categories.\n\nExigencies may arise in the working of the Constitution which justify a recourse\n\nto the power of reserving a Bill for the consideration of the President. They\n\ncannot be foreseen with the vision of a soothsayer. The power having been\n\nconferred upon a constitutional functionary, it is conditioned by the expectation\n\nthat it would be exercised upon careful reflection and for resolving legitimate\n\nconcerns in regard to the validity of the legislation. The entrustment of a\n\nconstitutional discretion to the Governor is premised on the trust that the exercise\n\nof authority would be governed by constitutional statesmanship. In a federal\n\nstructure, the conferment of this constitutional discretion is not intended to thwart\n\ndemocratic federalism. The state legislatures represent the popular will of those\n\nwho elect their representatives. They are the collective embodiments of that will.\n\nThe act of reserving a Bill for the assent of the President must be undertaken\n\nupon careful reflection, upon a doubt being entertained by the Governor about\n\nthe constitutional legitimacy of the Bill which has been passed.\nIbid at page 244\nPART D\n\n64 Dr Dhavan in the course of his submissions, has dwelt at length on the\n\npower which is entrusted to the Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of\n\nthe President under\nArticle 254 (2).\n\nArticle 254 (2)\ndeals with a situation where a\n\nlaw which has been enacted by the legislature of a state on a matter which is\n\nenumerated in the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule contains any\n\nprovision which is repugnant either to an earlier law made by Parliament or an\n\nexisting law with respect to that matter. In such an eventuality, the law made by\n\nthe legislature of the state can prevail in that state only if it has received the\n\nassent of the President on being reserved for consideration.\n\n65 When the reservation of a Bill for the assent of the President has been\n\noccasioned on the ground of a repugnancy with an existing law or a law enacted\n\nby the Parliament, there are decisions of this Court which hold that the President\n\nhas to be apprised of the reason why the assent was sought. In Gram\n\nPanchayat of Village Jamalpur, a law enacted by the Punjab legislature in\n\n1953, extinguished all private interests in Shamlat-deh lands and vested them in\n\nthe village Panchayats as a matter of agrarian reform. This Court held that the\n\nPunjab enactment had not been reserved for the assent of the President on the\n\nground that it was repugnant to an earlier Act enacted by Parliament in 1950 but\n\nthe assent was sought for a different and a specific purpose. In this background,\n\nthe Constitution Bench held that the assent of the President would not avail the\n\nstate government to accord precedence to the law enacted by the state\n\nlegislature over the law made by Parliament. The Constitution Bench held:\nPART D\n\n―12…The assent of the President under\nArticle 254(2)\nof the\nConstitution is not a matter of idle formality. The President\nhas, at least, to be apprised of the reason why his assent is\nsought if, there is any special reason for doing so. If the\nassent is sought and given in general terms so as to be\neffective for all purposes, different considerations may\nlegitimately arise. But if, as in the instant case, the assent of\nthe President is sought to the Law for a specific purpose, the\nefficacy of the assent would be limited to that purpose and\ncannot be extended beyond it.‖88\n\n66 A similar principle was adopted in Kaiser-I-Hind Pvt Ltd. The case\n\nconcerned rent legislation in Maharashtra and the Public Premises (Eviction of\n\nUnauthorized Occupants) Act 1971 enacted by Parliament. This Court held that\n\nwhere the assent was given after considering the repugnancy between the\n\nBombay Rent Act, the Transfer of Property Act and the Presidency Small Cause\n\nCourts Act, it was not correct to hold that the state law would prevail over another\n\nparliamentary enactment for which no assent had been sought. In that context,\n\nthe Court held:\n\n―65… 2. (a)\nArticle 254(2)\ncontemplates ―reservation for\nconsideration of the President‖ and also ―assent‖. Reservation\nfor consideration is not an empty formality. Pointed attention\nof the President is required to be drawn to the repugnancy\nbetween the earlier law made by Parliament and the\ncontemplated State legislation and the reasons for having\nsuch law despite the enactment by Parliament.\n\n(b) The word ―assent‖ used in clause (2) of\nArticle 254\nwould\nin context mean express agreement of mind to what is\nproposed by the State.‖89\n\n67 These decisions are specifically in the context of\nArticle 254.\n\nArticle 254(1)\n\npostulates inter alia, that in a matter which is governed by the Concurrent List, a\nSupra 67 at pages 668-669\nSupra 66 at pages 215-216\nPART D\n\nlaw which has been enacted by the legislature of a state shall be void to the\n\nextent of its repugnancy with a law enacted by the Parliament. Clause (2) of\n\nArticle 254\nobviates that consequence where the law has been reserved for the\n\nconsideration of the President and has received assent.\nArticle 254(1)\nis made\n\nsubject to Clause (2), thereby emphasizing that the assent of the President will\n\ncure a repugnancy of the state law with a law enacted by the Parliament in a\n\nmatter falling in the Concurrent List. It is in this context, that the decisions of this\n\nCourt hold that the assent of the President should be sought in relation to a\n\nrepugnancy with a specific provision contained in a Parliamentary legislation so\n\nas to enable due consideration by the President of the ground on which assent\n\nhas been sought.\nArticle 200\ncontains the source of the constitutional power\n\nwhich is conferred upon the Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the\n\nPresident.\nArticle 254 (2)\nis an illustration of the constitutional authority of the\n\nGovernor to reserve a law enacted by the state legislature for consideration of the\n\nPresident in a specified situation - where it is repugnant to an existing law or to a\n\nParliamentary legislation on a matter falling in the Concurrent List. The\n\neventuality which is specified in\nArticle 254 (2)\ndoes not exhaust the ambit of the\n\npower entrusted to the Governor under\nArticle 200\nto reserve a Bill for the\n\nconsideration of the President. Apart from a repugnancy in matters falling in the\n\nConcurrent List between state and Parliamentary legislation, a Governor may\n\nhave sound constitutional reasons to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the\n\nPresident.\nArticle 200\n, in its second proviso mandates that a Bill which derogates\n\nfrom the powers of the High Court must be reserved for the consideration of the\n\nPresident. Apart from Bills which fall within the description set out in the second\nPART D\n\nproviso, the Governor may legitimately refer a Bill for consideration of the\n\nPresident upon entertaining a legitimate doubt about the validity of the law. By its\n\nvery nature, it would not be possible for this Court to reflect upon the situations in\n\nwhich the power under\nArticle 200\ncan be exercised. This was noticed in the\n\njudgment of this Court in Hoechst. Excluding it from judicial scrutiny, the Court\n\nheld:\n\n―86…There may also be a Bill passed by the State\nLegislature where there may be a genuine doubt about the\napplicability of any of the provisions of the Constitution which\nrequire the assent of the President to be given to it in order\nthat it may be effective as an Act. In such a case, it is for the\nGovernor to exercise his discretion and to decide whether he\nshould assent to the Bill or should reserve it for consideration\nof the President to avoid any future complication. Even if it\nultimately turns out that there was no necessity for the\nGovernor to have reserved a Bill for the consideration of the\nPresident, still he having done so and obtained the assent of\nthe President, the Act so passed cannot be held to be\nunconstitutional on the ground of want of proper assent. This\naspect of the matter, as the law now stands, is not open to\nscrutiny by the courts. In the instant case, the Finance Bill\nwhich ultimately became the Act in question was a\nconsolidating Act relating to different subjects and perhaps\nthe Governor felt that it was necessary to reserve it for the\nassent of the President. We have no hesitation in holding that\nthe assent of the President is not justiciable, and we cannot\nspell out any infirmity arising out of his decision to give such\nassent.‖90\n\n68 Hoechst is an authority for the proposition that the assent of the President\n\nis non - justiciable. Hoechst also lays down that even if, as it turns out, it was not\n\nnecessary for the Governor to reserve a Bill for the consideration of the\n\nPresident, yet if it was reserved for and received the assent of the President, the\nSupra 68 at pages 100-101\nPART D\n\nlaw as enacted cannot be regarded as unconstitutional for want of ‗proper‘\n\nassent.\n\n69 The above decisions essentially answer the submissions which were urged\n\nby Dr Dhavan. The law as propounded in the line of precedents adverted to\n\nabove must negate the submissions which were urged on behalf of the\n\npetitioners. Once the Bill (which led to the Reservation Act 2018) was reserved\n\nby the Governor for the consideration of the President, it was for the President to\n\neither grant or withhold assent to the Bill. The President having assented to the\n\nBill, the requirements of\nArticle 201\nwere fulfilled. The validity of the assent by the\n\nPresident is non-justiciable. The Governor, while reserving the Bill in the present\n\ncase for the consideration of the President on 6 December 2017 observed thus:\n\n―The Supreme Court in the case of BK Pavitra Case, while\nconsidering the issue of grant of promotion to persons\nbelonging to SC and STs has observed the necessity of\napplying the test of inadequacy of representation,\nbackwardness and overall efficiency, for exercise of power\nunder\nArticle 16 (4A)\nof the Constitution and has directed the\nState Government to revise the seniority list within the time\nframe.\n\nThe State Government to overcome the situation which was\nfound fault with by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid\njudgment has come out with a Bill, which is now sent for my\nassent.\n\nHaving regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the\naforesaid case and importance of the issue and the\nConstitutional interpretation involved in the matter, I deem it\nappropriate to reserve the matter for the consideration of the\nPresident. Accordingly, the Bill is reserved for the\nconsideration of the President under\nArticle 200\nof the\nConstitution of India.‖\nPART E\n\n70 The state government, in the course of its clarifications, was of the view\n\nthat there was no necessity of reserving the Bill for the consideration of the\n\nPresident, since in its view, the Governor had not recorded a finding that it was\n\nunconstitutional, or fell afoul of existing central legislation on the subject or that it\n\nwas beyond legislative competence or derogated from the fundamental rights. All\n\nprocedural requirements under the Constitution were according to the\n\ngovernment duly complied with. This objection of the state government cannot\n\ncast doubt upon the grant of assent by the President. The law having received\n\nthe assent of the President, the submissions which were urged on behalf of the\n\npetitioners cannot be countenanced.\n\nE Does the Reservation Act 2018 overrule or nullify B K Pavitra I\n\n71 The foundation of the decision in B K Pavitra I is the principle enunciated\n\nin Nagaraj that in order to sustain the exercise of the enabling power contained in\n\nArticle 16 (4A)\n, the state is required to demonstrate a ―compelling necessity‖ by\n\ncollecting quantifiable data on: (i) inadequacy of representation; (ii)\n\nbackwardness; and (iii) overall efficiency. The judgment in B K Pavitra I held\n\nthat no such exercise was undertaken by the State of Karnataka before providing\n\nfor reservation in promotion and providing for consequential seniority. On the\n\nground that the state had not collected quantifiable data on the three parameters\n\nenunciated in Nagaraj, the Reservation Act 2002 was held to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe Constitution Bench in Nagaraj upheld the validity of\nArticle 16 (4A)\non the\n\nbasis that before taking recourse to the enabling power the state has to carry out\nPART E\n\nthe exercise of collecting quantifiable data and fulfilling the three parameters\n\nnoted above. B K Pavitra I essentially held that there was a failure on the part of\n\nthe state to undertake this exercise, which was a pre-condition for the exercise of\n\nthe enabling power to make reservations in promotions and to provide for\n\nconsequential seniority.\n\n72 The decision in B K Pavitra I did not restrain the state from carrying out\n\nthe exercise of collecting quantifiable data so as to fulfil the conditionalities for the\n\nexercise of the enabling power under\nArticle 16 (4A).\nThe legislature has the\n\nplenary power to enact a law. That power extends to enacting a legislation both\n\nwith prospective and retrospective effect. Where a law has been invalidated by\n\nthe decision of a constitutional court, the legislature can amend the law\n\nretrospectively or enact a law which removes the cause for invalidation. A\n\nlegislature cannot overrule a decision of the court on the ground that it is\n\nerroneous or is nullity. But, it is certainly open to the legislature either to amend\n\nan existing law or to enact a law which removes the basis on which a declaration\n\nof invalidity was issued in the exercise of judicial review. Curative legislation is\n\nconstitutionally permissible. It is not an encroachment on judicial power. In the\n\npresent case, state legislature of Karnataka, by enacting the Reservation Act\n\n2018, has not nullified the judicial decision in B K Pavitra I, but taken care to\n\nremedy the underlying cause which led to a declaration of invalidity in the first\n\nplace. Such a law is valid because it removes the basis of the decision.\nPART E\n\n73 These principles have consistently been reiterated in a line of precedents\n\nemerging from this Court. In Utkal Contractors and Joinery (P) Ltd, this Court\n\nheld:\n\n―15. …The legislature may, at any time, in exercise of the\nplenary power conferred on it by\nArticles 245\nand\nof the\nConstitution render a judicial decision ineffective by enacting\na valid law. There is no prohibition against retrospective\nlegislation. The power of the legislature to pass a law\npostulates the power to pass it prospectively as well as\nretrospectively. That of course, is subject to the legislative\ncompetence and subject to other constitutional limitations.\nThe rendering ineffective of judgments or orders of competent\ncourts by changing their basis by legislative enactment is a\nwell-known pattern of all validating acts. Such validating\nlegislation which removes the causes of ineffectiveness or\ninvalidity of action or proceedings cannot be considered as\nencroachment on judicial power. The legislature, however,\ncannot by a bare declaration, without more, directly overrule,\nreverse or set aside any judicial decision…‖91\n\n(See also in this context :\nBhubaneshwar Singh v Union of India92\n, Indian\n\nAluminium Co v State of Kerala93 (―Indian Aluminium Co‖), Narain Singh94\n\nand Cheviti Venkanna Yadav).\n\n74 The legislature has the power to validate a law which is found to be invalid\n\nby curing the infirmity. As an incident of the exercise of this power, the legislature\n\nmay enact a validating law to make the provisions of the earlier law effective from\n\nthe date on which it was enacted (The United Provinces v Mst Atiqa Begum95\nSupra 74 at page 759\n(1994) 6 SCC 77\n(1996) 7 SCC 637\n(2009) 13 SCC 165\nAIR 1941 FC 16\nPART E\n\nand Rai Ramkrishna v State of Bihar96). These principles were elucidated in the\n\ndecision of this Court in Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd. The judgment makes a\n\ndistinction between a law which simply declares that a decision of the court will\n\nnot bind (which is impermissible for the legislature) and a law which\n\nfundamentally alters the basis of an earlier legislation so that the decision would\n\nnot have been given in the altered circumstances. This distinction is elaborated in\n\nthe following extract:\n\n―4. … Granted legislative competence, it is not sufficient to\ndeclare merely that the decision of the Court shall not bind for\nthat is tantamount to reversing the decision in exercise of\njudicial power which the Legislature does not possess or\nexercise. A court's decision must always bind unless the\nconditions on which it is based are so fundamentally altered\nthat the decision could not have been given in the altered\ncircumstances. Ordinarily, a court holds a tax to be invalidly\nimposed because the power to tax is wanting or the statute or\nthe rules or both are invalid or do not sufficiently create the\njurisdiction. Validation of a tax so declared illegal may be\ndone only if the grounds of illegality or invalidity are capable\nof being removed and are in fact removed and the tax thus\nmade legal.‖97\n\n75 In State of T N v Arooran Sugars Ltd98, a Constitution Bench of this\n\nCourt recognized the power of the legislature to enact a law retrospectively to\n\ncure a defect found by the Court. It was held that in doing so, the legislature did\n\nnot nullify a writ or encroach upon judicial power. The legislature in remedying a\n\ndeficiency in the law acted within the scope of its authority. This Court held:\n\n―16…It is open to the legislature to remove the defect pointed\nout by the court or to amend the definition or any other\nprovision of the Act in question retrospectively. In this process\nit cannot be said that there has been an encroachment by the\n(1964) 1 SCR 897\nSupra 55 at pages 286-287\n(1997) 1 SCC 326\nPART E\n\nlegislature over the power of the judiciary. A court‘s directive\nmust always bind unless the conditions on which it is based\nare so fundamentally altered that under altered circumstances\nsuch decisions could not have been given.\nThis will include\nremoval of the defect in a statute pointed out in the judgment\nin question, as well as alteration or substitution of provisions\nof the enactment on which such judgment is based, with\nretrospective effect.‖99\n\nThe same principle was formulated in the decision of this Court in\nVirender\n\nSingh Hooda v State of Haryana100\n:\n\n―59. …vested rights can be taken away by retrospective\nlegislation by removing the basis of a judgment so long as the\namendment does not violate the fundamental rights. We are\nunable to accept the broad proposition… that the effect of the\nwrits issued by the courts cannot be nullified by the legislature\nby enacting a law with retrospective effect. The question, in\nfact, is not of nullifying the effect of writs which may be issued\nby the High Court or this Court. The question is of removing\nthe basis which resulted in issue of such a writ. If the basis is\nnullified by enactment of a valid legislation which has the\neffect of depriving a person of the benefit accrued under a\nwrit, the denial of such benefit is incidental to the power to\nenact a legislation with retrospective effect. Such an exercise\nof power cannot be held to be usurpation of judicial\npower…‖101\n\n76 A declaration by a court that a law is constitutionally invalid does not fetter\n\nthe authority of the legislature to remedy the basis on which the declaration was\n\nissued by curing the grounds for invalidity. While curing the defect, it is essential\n\nto understand the reasons underlying the declaration of invalidity. The reasons\n\nconstitute the basis of the declaration. The legislature cannot simply override the\n\ndeclaration of invalidity without remedying the basis on which the law was held to\n\nbe ultra vires. A law may have been held to be invalid on the ground that the\nIbid at page 340\n(2004) 12 SCC 588\nIbid at page 616\nPART E\n\nlegislature which enacted the law had no legislative competence on the subject\n\nmatter of the legislation. Obviously, in such a case, a legislature which has been\n\nheld to lack legislative competence cannot arrogate to itself competence over a\n\nsubject matter over which it has been held to lack legislative competence.\n\nHowever, a legislature which has the legislative competence to enact a law on\n\nthe subject can certainly step in and enact a legislation on a field over which it\n\npossesses legislative competence. For instance, where a law has been\n\ninvalidated on the ground that the state legislature lacks legislative competence\n\nto enact a law on a particular subject – Parliament being conferred with legislative\n\ncompetence over the same subject – it is open for the Parliament, following a\n\ndeclaration of the invalidity of the state law, to enact a new law and to regulate\n\nthe area. As an incident of its validating exercise, Parliament may validate the\n\ncollection of a levy under the earlier law. The collection of a levy under a law\n\nwhich has been held to be invalid is validated by the enactment of legislation by a\n\nlegislative body – Parliament in the above example – which has competence over\n\nthe subject matter. Apart from legislative competence, a law may have been\n\ndeclared invalid on the ground that there was a breach of the fundamental rights\n\ncontained in Part III of the Constitution. In that situation, if the legislature\n\nproceeds to enact a new law on the subject, the issue in essence is whether the\n\nre-enacted law has taken care to remove the infractions of the fundamental rights\n\non the basis of which the earlier law was held to be invalid. The true test\n\ntherefore is whether the legislature has acted within the bounds of its authority to\n\nremedy the basis on which the earlier law was held to suffer from a constitutional\n\ninfirmity.\nPART E\n\n77 The petitioners have placed a considerable degree of reliance on the\n\ndecision in Madan Mohan Pathak, where a law –\nThe Life Insurance Corporation\n\n(Modification of Settlements) Act\n1976 was enacted by Parliament to render\n\nineffective a settlement which was arrived at between LIC and its employees for\n\nthe payment of bonus. The law was challenged by the employees. In that case,\n\nthere was a judgment of the Calcutta High Court which had given effect to the\n\nright of the employees to an annual cash bonus under an industrial settlement, by\n\nthe issuance of a writ of mandamus. The mandamus bound the parties to the\n\ndispute. It was in this backdrop that the Constitution Bench observed that the\n\neffect of the mandamus issued by the High Court could not simply be nullified by\n\nenacting a law overriding the industrial settlement. This Court held:\n\n―9...Here the judgment given by the Calcutta High Court,\nwhich is relied upon by the petitioners, is not a mere\ndeclaratory judgment holding an impost or tax to be invalid,\nso that a validation statute can remove the defect pointed out\nby the judgment amending the law with retrospective effect\nand validate such impost or tax. But it is a judgment giving\neffect to the right of the petitioners to annual cash bonus\nunder the Settlement by issuing a writ of mandamus directing\nthe Life Insurance Corporation to pay the amount of such\nbonus. If by reason of retrospective alteration of the factual or\nlegal situation, the judgment is rendered erroneous, the\nremedy may be by way of appeal or review, but so long as\nthe judgment stands, it cannot be disregarded or ignored and\nit must be obeyed by the Life Insurance Corporation. We are,\ntherefore, of the view that, in any event, irrespective of\nwhether the impugned Act is constitutionally valid or not, the\nLife Insurance Corporation is bound to obey the writ of\nmandamus issued by the Calcutta High Court and to pay\nannual cash bonus for the year April 1, 1975 to March 31,\n1976 to Class III and Class IV employees.‖102\nSupra 56 at page 67\nPART E\n\n78 The decision in Madan Mohan Pathak is hence distinguishable from the\n\nfacts of the present case. The above observations recognized the constitutional\n\nposition that in the case of a declaratory judgment holding an action to be invalid,\n\na validating legislation to remove the defect is permissible. Applying this principle,\n\nit is evident that the decision in B K Pavitra I declared the Reservation Act 2002\n\nto be invalid and consequent upon the declaration of invalidity, certain directions\n\nwere issued. If the basis on which Reservation Act 2002 was held to be invalid is\n\ncured by a validating legislation, in this case the Reservation Act 2018, this would\n\nconstitute a permissible legislative exercise. The grounds which weighed in\n\nMadan Mohan Pathak would hence not be available in the present case.\n\n79 The decision in Madan Mohan Pathak has been adverted to and clarified\n\nin several decisions of this Court rendered subsequently. These include:\n\n(\ni) Sri Ranga Match Industries v Union of India103\n, where it was held that:\n\n―14. While appreciating the ratio of the said opinions, it is\nnecessary to bear in mind the basic fact that the settlement\nbetween the Corporation and its employees was not based\nupon any statute or statutory provision. Sub-sections (1) and\n(3) of\nSection 18\nof the Industrial Disputes Act provide merely\nthe binding nature of such settlements; they do not constitute\nthe basis of the settlements. The settlement between the\nparties was directed to be implemented by the High\nCourt. In other words, it was not a case where the High\nCourt either struck down a statutory provision nor was it\na case where a statutory provision was interpreted in a\nparticular manner or directed to be implemented. It was\nalso not a case where the statutory provision, on which\nthe judgment was based, was amended or altered to\nremove/rectify the defect.‖104 (Emphasis supplied)\n1994 Supp. (2) SCC 726\nIbid at pages 736-737\nPART E\n\n(ii) Indian Aluminium Co, where it was held that:\n\n―49.\nIn\nMadan Mohan Pathak v.

In view of the above, we allow these appeals, set aside\nthe impugned judgment and declare the provisions of the\nimpugned Act to the extent of doing away with the ‗catch-up‘\nrule and providing for consequential seniority under Sections\n3 and 4 to persons belonging to SCs and STs on promotion\nagainst roster points to be ultra vires\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.‖108\n\nDr Dhavan is entirely correct, if we may say so with respect, in submitting ―that\n\nwhat has to be shown is whether the Reservation Act 2018 is, in law\nArticles 14\n\nand\ncompliant‖. This necessitates an examination of the constitutionality of the\n\nReservation Act 2018.

The Ratna Prabha Committee\nSupra 5 at page 641\nPART E\n\nwas constituted after the Reservation Act 2002 was held to be invalid in B K\n\nPavitra I on the ground that no compelling necessity had been shown by the\n\nstate to provide for reservation in matters of promotion for SCs and STs by\n\ncollecting and analysing relevant data to satisfy the requirements laid out in\n\nNagaraj. The constitution of the Ratna Prabha Committee was consequent upon\n\nthe Reservation Act 2002 having been held to be invalid in B K Pavitra I.\n\n83 The Statement of Objects and Reasons is extracted below, insofar as it is\n\nmaterial:\n\n―The Hon‘ble Supreme Court of India in its judgment dated:\n\n09.02.2017 in the case of BK Pavitra and others Vs Union of\nIndia and others in Civil Appeal No. 2368 of 2011 and\nconnected matters while dealing with the issue of\nconsequential seniority provided to the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes, having regard to the ratio of the decision of\nthe Constitution Bench in M.Nagaraj in Writ Petition No. 61 of\n2002 has observed that a proper exercise for determining\n‗inadequacy of representation‘ ‗backwardness‘ and ‗overall\nefficiency‘ is a must for exercise of power under\nArticle 16\n(4A).\nThe court held that in the absence of this exercise under\n\nArticle 16 (4A)\nit is the ―catch-up‖ rule that shall be applicable.\n\nHaving observed this the Court declared the provisions of\n\nSections 3\nand\nof the Karnataka Act 10 of 2002 to be ultra\nvires of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The Hon‘ble\nSupreme Court directed that revision of the Seniority lists be\nundertaken and completed within three months and further\nconsequential action be taken within the next three months;\n\nIn order to comply with the directions of the Hon‘ble Supreme\nCourt in BK Pavitra and others vs Union of India and others in\nCivil Appeal No. 2368 of 2011 the Government has issued\norder vide Government order No. DPAR 182 SRR 2011 dated\n06.05.2017 to all appointing authorities to revise the seniority\nlists;\n\nWhile in compliance of the Supreme Court order, the\nGovernment considering the need and taking note of the\ndecision of the Constitution Bench in M Nagaraj, in Writ\nPetition No. 61 of 2002, has entrusted the task of conducting\nstudy and submitting a report on the backwardness of the\nPART E\n\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the state,\ninadequacy of their representation in the State Civil Services\nand the effect of reservation in promotion on the State\nadministration, to the Additional Chief Secretary to\nGovernment in Government order No. DPAR 182 SRR 2011\ndated 22.03.2017;\n\nThe Additional Chief Secretary to Government with the\nassistance of officers from various departments has collated\nthe scientific, quantifiable and relevant data collected and\nhaving made a detailed study of quantifiable data has\nsubmitted a report on backwardness of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes in the state, inadequacy of their\nrepresentation in the State Civil Services and the effect of\nreservation in promotion on the State administration to the\nState Government;\n\nThe report confirms the backwardness of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in the state, inadequacy of their\nrepresentation in the State Civil Services and that the overall\nefficiency of administration has not been affected or\nhampered by extending reservation in promotion to the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the state and\ncontinuance of reservation in promotion within the limits will\nnot affect or hamper overall efficiency of administration;‖\n\n84 The first principle of statutory interpretation guides us towards the view that\n\nundoubtedly, the Statement of Objects and Reasons:\n\n(i) Cannot be used for restricting the plain meaning of a legislation109;\n\n(ii) Cannot determine whether a provision is valid110; and\n\n(iii) May not be definitive of the circumstances in which it was passed111.\n\n[See in this context\nWelfare Association v Ranjit112\n].\nBhaiji v Sub-Divisional Officer, Thandla\n: (2003) 1 SCC 692 at page 700, A Manjula Bhashini v A P Monen‘s\nCoor.\n\nFinance Corp.

While it cannot prevail over the provisions of the\n\nstatute, it can be an aid to resolve an ambiguity113.\n\n86 In the course of his submissions, Dr Dhavan has emphasized the ―new\n\nprovisions‖ contained in the Reservation Act 2018. These according to him, are:\n\n(i)\nSection 2 (d)\nwhich defines ‗backlog‘;\n\n(ii) Section 5 under which the appointing authority is to revise and redraw the\n\nexisting seniority lists;\n\n(iii) Section 7 which deals with the power to remove difficulties;\n\n(iv) Section 8 which provides for the repeal of the Reservation Act 2002; and\n\n(v) Section 9 which is a validating provision.\n\n87 The essential issue which now needs to be addressed by this Court is\n\nwhether the basis of the decision in B K Pavitra I has been cured. The decision\n\nof the Constitution Bench in Nagaraj mandates that before the State can take\n\nrecourse to the enabling power contained in Clauses (4A) and (4B) of\nArticle 16\n,\n\nit must demonstrate the existence of ―compelling reasons‖ on three facets: (i)\n\nbackwardness; (ii) inadequacy of representation; and (iii) overall administrative\n\nefficiency. In Jarnail, the Constitution Bench clarified that the first of the above\n\nfactors – ―backwardness‖ has no application in the case of reservations for the\n\nSCs and STs. Nagaraj to that extent was held to be contrary to the decision of\n\nthe larger Bench in Indra Sawhney.\nBurrakur Coal Co. Ltd. v Union of India\n: AIR 1961 SC 954 at pages 956-957\nPART E\n\nE.2 The Ratna Prabha Committee report\n\n88 The decision in B K Pavitra I was rendered on 9 February 2017. The\n\nRatna Prabha Committee was established on 22 March 2017. Its report was\n\nexamined by a Cabinet Sub-Committee on 4 August 2017 and was eventually\n\napproved by the Cabinet on 7 August 2017. The Ratna Prabha Committee report\n\nwas commissioned to : (i) collect information on cadre wise representation of SC\n\nand ST employees in all government departments; (ii) collect information on\n\nbackwardness of SCs and STs; and (iii) study the effect on the administration due\n\nto the promotion of SCs and STs.\n\n89 Dr Dhavan‘s challenge to the report is basically founded on the following\n\nfeatures:\n\n(i) Only thirty one out of sixty two government departments were examined;\n\n(ii) No data was collected for public sector undertakings, boards, corporations,\n\nlocal bodies, grant-in-aid institutions and autonomous bodies;\n\n(iii) In PWD and KPTCL, the representation is excessive;\n\n(iv) The data is vacancy based and not post based as required by Sabharwal;\n\n(v) The data is on sanctioned posts and not of filled posts;\n\n(vi) The data is based on grades A, B, C and D and not cadre based; and\n\n(vii) On efficiency, there is only a general reference to the economic\n\ndevelopment of the State of Karnataka.\n\n90 Based on the above features, the petitioners have invoked the power of\n\njudicial review. Dr Dhavan emphasized that the decision in Nagaraj upheld the\n\nconstitutional validity of successive constitutional amendments to\nArticle 16\nPART E\n\nconditional upon the existence of compelling reasons which must be\n\ndemonstrated by the State by collecting and analysing relevant data. It is\n\nsubmitted that the flaws in the report of the Ratna Prabha Committee would\n\nindicate that the compelling reasons which constitute the foundation for the\n\nexercise of the enabling power contained in\nArticle 16\nare absent, which must\n\nresult in the invalidation of the Reservation Act 2018.\n\n91 Before we deal with the merits of the attack on the Ratna Prabha\n\nCommittee report, it is necessary to set down the parameters on which judicial\n\nreview can be exercised. Essentially, the exercise which the petitioners require\n\nthis Court to undertake is to scrutinize the underlying collection of data by the\n\nState on two facets laid out in Nagaraj, as now clarified by Jarnail: (i) the\n\nadequacy of representation; and (ii) impact on efficiency in administration.\n\nClause (4) of\nArticle 16\ncontains an enabling provision to empower the State to\n\nmake reservations in appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of\n\ncitizens ―which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the\n\nservices under the State‖. Clause (4A) contains an enabling provision that allows\n\nthe state to provide for reservations in promotion with consequential seniority in\n\nposts or classes of posts in services under the State in favour of SCs and STs.\n\nClause (4A) also uses the expression ―which, in the opinion of the State, are not\n\nadequately represented in the services under the State‖. In Indra Sawhney,\n\nwhile construing the nature of the satisfaction which has to be arrived at by the\n\nState, this Court held:\nPART E\n\n―798….The language of clause (4) makes it clear that the\nquestion whether a backward class of citizens is not\nadequately represented in the services under the State is a\nmatter within the subjective satisfaction of the State. This is\nevident from the fact that the said requirement is preceded by\nthe words ―in the opinion of the State‖. This opinion can be\nformed by the State on its own, i.e., on the basis of the\nmaterial it has in its possession already or it may gather such\nmaterial through a Commission/Committee, person or\nauthority. All that is required is, there must be some material\nupon which the opinion is formed. Indeed, in this matter the\ncourt should show due deference to the opinion of the State,\nwhich in the present context means the executive. The\nexecutive is supposed to know the existing conditions in the\nsociety, drawn as it is from among the representatives of the\npeople in Parliament/Legislature. It does not, however, mean\nthat the opinion formed is beyond judicial scrutiny altogether.\nThe scope and reach of judicial scrutiny in matters within\nsubjective satisfaction of the executive are well and\nextensively stated in\nBarium Chemicals v. Company Law\nBoard\n[1966 Supp SCR 311 : AIR 1967 SC 295] which need\nnot be repeated here. Suffice it to mention that the said\nprinciples apply equally in the case of a constitutional\nprovision like\nArticle 16 (4)\nwhich expressly places the\nparticular fact (inadequate representation) within the\nsubjective judgment of the State/executive.‖114 (Emphasis\nsupplied)\n\nThe above extract from the decision in Indra Sawhney presents two mutually\n\ncomplementary and reinforcing principles. The first principle is that the executive\n\narm of the state is aware of prevailing conditions. The legislature represents the\n\ncollective will of the people through their elected representatives. The\n\npresumption of constitutionality of a law enacted by a competent legislature\n\ntraces itself to the fundamental doctrine of constitutional jurisprudence that the\n\nlegislature is accountable to those who elect their representatives. Collectively,\n\nthe executive and the legislature are entrusted with the constitutional duty to\nSupra 13 at page 728\nPART E\n\nprotect social welfare.\n\nThis Court explained in\nAmalgamated Tea Estates Co\n\nLtd v State of Kerala115\n, the rationale for the principles of constitutionality:\n\n―11.The reason why a statute is presumed to be constitutional\nis that the Legislature is the best judge of the local conditions\nand circumstances and special needs of various classes of\npersons. ―(T)he Legislature is the best judge of the needs of\nparticular classes and to estimate the degree of evil so as to\nadjust its legislation according to the exigency found to\nexist.‖116\n\nThis principle was reiterated in\nV C Shukla v State (Delhi Administration\n)117:\n\n―11…Furthermore, the legislature which is in the best position\nto understand the needs and requirements of the people must\nbe given sufficient latitude for making selection or\ndifferentiation and so long as such a selection is not arbitrary\nand has a rational basis having regard to the object of the\nAct,\nArticle 14\nwould not be attracted. That is why this Court\nhas laid down that presumption is always in favour of the\nconstitutionality of an enactment and the onus lies upon the\nperson who attacks the statute to show that there has been\nan infraction of the constitutional concept of equality.‖118\n\n92 More recently, this was emphasized in\nState of Himachal Pradesh v\n\nSatpal Saini119\n:\n\n―12…The duty to formulate policies is entrusted to the\nexecutive whose accountability is to the legislature and,\nthrough it, to the people. The peril of adopting an incorrect\npolicy lies in democratic accountability to the people…‖120\n(1974) 4 SCC 415\nIbid at page 420\n(1980) Supp SCC 249\nIbid at page 259\n(2017) 11 SCC 42\nIbid at page 47\nPART E\n\n93 The second of the reinforcing principles which emerges from Indra\n\nSawhney is that the opinion of the government on the adequacy of\n\nrepresentation of the SCs and STs in the public services of the state is a matter\n\nwhich forms a part of the subjective satisfaction of the state. Significantly, the\n\nextract from Indra Sawhney reproduced earlier adverts to the decision in Barium\n\nChemicals Ltd, which emphasises that when an authority is vested with the\n\npower to form an opinion, it is not open for the court to substitute its own opinion\n\nfor that of the authority, nor can the opinion of the authority be challenged on\n\ngrounds of propriety or sufficiency. In Nagaraj, while dealing with the parameters\n\ngoverning the assessment of the adequacy of representation or of the impact on\n\nefficiency, the Constitution Bench held:\n\n―45… The basic presumption, however, remains that it is\nthe State who is in the best position to define and\nmeasure merit in whatever ways it consider it to be\nrelevant to public employment because ultimately it has\nto bear the costs arising from errors in defining and\nmeasuring merit. Similarly, the concept of ―extent of\nreservation‖ is not an absolute concept and like merit it is\ncontext-specific.\n\n…\n\n49. Reservation is necessary for transcending caste and not\nfor perpetuating it. Reservation has to be used in a limited\nsense otherwise it will perpetuate casteism in the country.\n\nReservation is underwritten by a special justification. Equality\nin\nArticle 16(1)\nis individual-specific whereas reservation in\n\nArticle 16 (4)\nand\nArticle 16(4A)\nis enabling. The discretion of\nthe State is, however, subject to the existence of\n―backwardness‖ and ―inadequacy of representation‖ in public\nemployment. Backwardness has to be based on objective\nfactors whereas inadequacy has to factually exist. This is\nwhere judicial review comes in. However, whether\nreservation in a given case is desirable or not, as a\npolicy, is not for us to decide as long as the parameters\nmentioned in\nArticles 16 (4)\nand\n16 (4A)\nare maintained. As\nstated above, equity, justice and merit (Article\nPART E\n\n335)/efficiency are variables which can only be identified\nand measured by the State.\n\n…\n\n102…equity, justice and efficiency are variable factors. These\nfactors are context-specific. There is no fixed yardstick to\nidentify and measure these three factors, it will depend\non the facts and circumstances of each case.‖121\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n94 The element of discretion vested in the state governments to determine\n\nadequacy of representation in promotional posts is once again emphasized in the\n\nfollowing extract from the decision in Jarnail:\n\n―35…According to us, Nagaraj has wisely left the test for\ndetermining adequacy of representation in promotional\nposts to the States for the simple reason that as the post\ngets higher, it may be necessary, even if a proportionality test\nto the population as a whole is taken into account, to reduce\nthe number of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in\npromotional pots, as one goes upwards. This is for the simple\nreason that efficiency of administration has to be looked at\nevery time promotions are made. As has been pointed out by\nB P Jeevan Reddy, J.‘s judgment in Indra Sawhney, there\nmay be certain posts right at the top, where reservation is\nimpermissible altogether. For this reason, we make it clear\nthat\nArticle 16 (4A)\nhas been couched in language which\nwould leave it to the States to determine adequate\nrepresentation depending upon the promotional post that\nis in question.‖122 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n95 In dealing with the submissions of the petitioners on this aspect, it is\n\nrelevant for this Court to recognize the circumspection with which judicial power\n\nmust be exercised on matters which pertain to propriety and sufficiency, in the\n\ncontext of scrutinizing the underlying collection of data by the State on the\n\nadequacy of representation and impact on efficiency. The Court, is above all,\nSupra 6 at pages 249-250\nSupra 49 at page 430\nPART E\n\nconsidering the validity of a law which was enacted by the State legislature for\n\nenforcing the substantive right to equality for the SCs and STs. Judicial review\n\nmust hence traverse conventional categories by determining as to whether the\n\nRatna Prabha Committee report considered material which was irrelevant or\n\nextraneous or had drawn a conclusion which no reasonable body of persons\n\ncould have adopted. In this area, the fact that an alternate line of approach was\n\npossible or may even appear to be desirable cannot furnish a foundation for the\n\nassumption by the court of a decision making authority which in the legislative\n\nsphere is entrusted to the legislating body and in the administrative sphere to the\n\nexecutive arm of the government.\n\n96 On the inadequacy of representation, the summary which emerges from\n\nthe Ratna Prabha Committee report is as follows:\n\n―2.5: Summary:\n\n1) The analysis of time series data collected for the last 32\nyears (1984-2016 except for 1986) across 31 Departments of\nthe State Government provides the rich information on the\ninadequacy of representation of SCs and STs employees in\nvarious cadres of Karnataka Civil Services.\n\n2) The total number of sanctioned posts as per the data of\n2016 is 7,45,593 of which 70.22 percent or 5,23,574 are filled\nup across 31 Departments.\n\n3) The vacancies or posts are filled up through Direct\nRecruitment (DR) and Promotions including consequential\npromotion.\n\n4) The overall representation of the SC and ST employees of\nall 31 Departments in comparison with total sanctioned posts\ncomprises of 10.65 per cent and 2.92 per cent respectively.\nThis proves inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs.\n\n5) On an average the representation in Cadre A for SCs is at\n12.07 per cent and STs 2.70 per cent which sufficiently\nproves the inadequacy of representation.\n\n6) The extent of representation in Cadre B is on an average\nof 9.79 per cent and 2.34 per cent for ST for all the years of\nthe study period.\nPART E\n\n7) It is observed that on an average 3.05 per cent of SC\nrepresentation is inadequate in the Cadre ‗C‘ whereas, 0.05\nper cent excess representation is seen for ST.\n\n8) On an average of 2 per cent and 1 per cent over\nrepresentation of employees of SCs and STs is found in\nCadre D respectively. However, in the last 5 years,\ninadequacy of representation of SCs by 3 per cent is found in\nthis cadre.\n\n9) The representation of Scheduled Caste in Cadre A, B and\nC is on an average 12, 9.79 and 12.04 per cent respectively\nwhereas in Cadre D it is 16.91.\n\n10) In case of STs in the cadres A and B the representation is\n2.70 and 2.34 per cent. However, excess representation of\n0.04 and 0.93 per cent is found in case of Group C and Group\nD respectively.\n\n11) Over representation in some years and departments is\nattributed to either Direct Recruitment or retirement of\nemployees or filling up of backlog vacancies as the later does\nnot fall under 50 per cent limitation of reservation.\n\n2.6: Conclusion:\n\nThe data clearly shows the inadequacy of representation of\nSCs and STs in the civil services in Groups A, B and C and\nadequate representation in Group D.‖\n\n97 Collection of data and its analysis are governed by varying and often\n\ndivergent approaches in the social sciences. An informative treatise on the\n\nsubject titled Empirical Political Analysis – Quantitative and Qualitative\n\nResearch Methods123 distinguishes between obtaining knowledge and using\n\nknowledge. The text seeks to explain empirical analysis on the one hand and\n\nnormative analysis on the other hand:\n\n―Social Scientists distinguish between obtaining knowledge\nand using knowledge. Dealing with factual realities is termed\nempirical analysis. Dealing with how we should use our\nknowledge of the world is termed normative analysis.\n\nEmpirical analysis is concerned with developing and\nusing a common, objective language to describe and explain\nreality. It can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative\nanalyses are based on math-based comparisons of the\nNinth edition, Richard C Rich, Craig Leonard Brians, Jarol B Manheim and Lars B Willnat, Longman\nPublishers\nPART E\n\ncharacteristics of the various objects or events that we study.\nQualitative analyses are based on the researcher‘s informed\nand contextual understanding of objects or events.\n\nNormative analysis is concerned with developing and\nexamining subjective values and ethical rules to guide us in\njudging and applying what we have learned about reality.\nAlthough the emphasis in this book is on empirical analysis, it\nseeks to develop an appreciation of the larger, normative\nperspective within which knowledge is acquired, interpreted,\nand applied through a discussion of the ethics of research.\n\nNormative analysis without an empirical foundation\ncan lead to value judgments that are out of touch with reality.\nEmpirical analysis in the absence of sensitivity to normative\nconcerns, on the other hand, can lead to the collection of\nobservations whose significance we are not prepared to\nunderstand fully. The objective in undertaking political inquiry\nis to draw upon both types of analysis – empirical and\nnormative – so as to maximize not only our factual\nknowledge, but also our ability to use the facts we discover\nwisely.‖\n\n98 In supporting the methodology which has been adopted by the Ratna\n\nPrabha Committee, Ms Indira Jaising, learned Senior Counsel emphasized that:\n\n(i) Save and except where a national census is proposed to be conducted,\n\ndata collection is based on valid sampling methods on which conclusions\n\nare drawn;\n\n(ii) Research methodology can be qualitative as well as quantitative – the\n\npresent case deals with the collection of quantitative data;\n\n(iii) Quantitative data is also collected on the basis of sample surveys. In this\n\ncase, the purpose of the study was to collect data on the adequacy of\n\nrepresentation in promotional posts and the sample which was chosen was\n\na representative sample from which conclusions were drawn; and\nPART E\n\n(iv) In the study conducted by the State of Karnataka, statistics of a number of\n\npersons belonging to the SCs and STs in promotional posts were collected\n\ngroup wise. The groups include cadres. Hence, it stands to reason that if\n\nthe data is collected in relation to a group, it will include data pertaining to\n\ncadres as well since, every cadre within the group has been statistically\n\nenquired.\n\n99 We find merit in the above submissions. The methodology which was\n\nadopted by the Ratna Prabha Committee has not been demonstrated to be alien\n\nto conventional social science methodologies. We are unable to find that the\n\nCommittee has based its conclusions on any extraneous or irrelevant material. In\n\nadopting recourse to sampling methodologies, the Committee cannot be held to\n\nhave acted arbitrarily. If, as we have held above, sampling is a valid methodology\n\nfor collection of data, the necessary consequence is that the exercise cannot be\n\ninvalidated only on the ground that data pertaining to a particular department or\n\nof some entities was not analysed. The data which was collected pertained to\n\nthirty one departments which are representative in character. The State has\n\nanalysed the data which is both relevant and representative, before drawing its\n\nconclusions. As we have noted earlier, there are limitations on the power of\n\njudicial review in entering upon a factual arena involving the gathering, collation\n\nand analysis of data.\n\n100 Dr Dhavan has painstakingly compiled charts for the purpose of his\n\nargument. We may also note at this stage that Ms Jaising in response to the\n\ncharts relied upon by Dr Dhavan, also placed on records charts indicating:\nPART E\n\n(i) Current representation after demotion of SC and ST employees in the\n\nPWD of Karnataka;\n\n(ii) Percentage of SCs and STs in the post of Executive Engineer without\n\nconsequential seniority in the PWD; and\n\n(iii) Corresponding figures in the post of Executive Engineer without\n\nconsequential seniority in the PWD.\n\n101 We are of the view that once an opinion has been formed by the State\n\ngovernment on the basis of the report submitted by an expert committee which\n\ncollected, collated and analysed relevant data, it is impossible for the Court to\n\nhold that the compelling reasons which Nagaraj requires the State to\n\ndemonstrate have not been established. Even if there were to be some errors in\n\ndata collection, that will not justify the invalidation of a law which the competent\n\nlegislature was within its power to enact. After the decision in B K Pavitra I, the\n\nRatna Prabha Committee was correctly appointed to carry out the required\n\nexercise. Once that exercise has been carried out, the Court must be\n\ncircumspect in exercising the power of judicial review to re-evaluate the factual\n\nmaterial on record.\n\n102 The adequacy of representation has to be assessed with reference to a\n\nbenchmark on adequacy. Conventionally, the State and the Central governments\n\nhave linked the percentage of reservation for the SCs and STs to their\n\npercentage of population, as a measure of adequacy. The Constitution Bench\n\nnoticed this in Sabharwal, where it observed:\nPART E\n\n―4. When a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of a\nparticular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve points, it\nhas to be taken that the posts shown at the reserve points are\nto be filled from amongst the members of reserve categories\nand the candidates belonging to the general category are not\nentitled to be considered for the reserved posts. On the other\nhand the reserve category candidates can compete for the\nnon-reserve posts and in the event of their appointment to the\nsaid posts their number cannot be added and taken into\nconsideration for working out the percentage of reservation.\n\nArticle 16 (4)\nof the Constitution of India permits the State\nGovernment to make any provision for the reservation of\nappointments or posts in favour of any Backward Class of\ncitizens which, in the opinion of the State is not adequately\nrepresented in the Services under the State. It is, therefore,\nincumbent on the State Government to reach a conclusion\nthat the Backward Class/Classes for which the reservation is\nmade is not adequately represented in the State Services.\nWhile doing so the State Government may take the total\npopulation of a particular Backward Class and its\nrepresentation in the State Services. When the State\nGovernment after doing the necessary exercise makes the\nreservation and provides the extent of percentage of posts to\nbe reserved for the said Backward Class then the percentage\nhas to be followed strictly. The prescribed percentage cannot\nbe varied or changed simply because some of the members\nof the Backward Class have already been\nappointed/promoted against the general seats. As mentioned\nabove the roster point which is reserved for a Backward Class\nhas to be filled by way of appointment/promotion of the\nmember of the said class. No general category candidate can\nbe appointed against a slot in the roster which is reserved for\nthe Backward Class…‖124\n\nExplaining this further, the Constitution Bench held:\n\n―5...Once the prescribed percentage of posts is filled the\nnumerical test of adequacy is satisfied and thereafter the\nroster does not survive. The percentage of reservation is the\ndesired representation of the Backward Classes in the State\nServices and is consistent with the demographic estimate\nbased on the proportion worked out in relation to their\npopulation. The numerical quota of posts is not a shifting\nboundary but represents a figure with due application of mind.\nTherefore, the only way to assure equality of opportunity to\nthe Backward Classes and the general category is to permit\nSupra 24 at page 750\nPART E\n\nthe roster to operate till the time the respective\nappointees/promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the\nroster…‖125\n\nConsequently, it is open to the State to make reservation in promotion for SCs\n\nand STs proportionate to their representation in the general population.\n\n103 One of the submissions which has been urged on behalf of the petitioners\n\nis that the quota has to be reckoned with reference to posts which are actually\n\nfilled up or the working strength and not with reference to sanctioned posts. This\n\nsubmission is answered by the decision in Sabharwal, which holds that the\n\npercentage of reservation has to be worked out in relation to the number of posts\n\nwhich form part of the cadre strength. The Constitution Bench held:\n\n―6. The expressions ‗posts‘ and ‗vacancies‘, often used in the\nexecutive instructions providing for reservations, are rather\nproblematical. The word ‗post‘ means an appointment, job,\noffice or employment. A position to which a person is\nappointed. ‗Vacancy‘ means an unoccupied post or office.\nThe plain meaning of the two expressions make it clear that\nthere must be a ‗post‘ in existence to enable the ‗vacancy‘ to\noccur. The cadre-strength is always measured by the\nnumber of posts comprising the cadre. Right to be\nconsidered for appointment can only be claimed in\nrespect of a post in a cadre. As a consequence the\npercentage of reservation has to be worked out in\nrelation to the number of posts which form the cadre-\nstrength. The concept of „vacancy‟ has no relevance in\noperating the percentage of reservation.‖126 (Emphasis\nsupplied)\nIbid at page 751\nIbid at pages 751-752\nPART E\n\nSimilarly, in Nagaraj, the Constitution Bench held:\n\n―83. In our view, the appropriate Government has to apply the\ncadre strength as a unit in the operation of the roster in order\nto ascertain whether a given class/group is adequately\nrepresented in the service. The cadre strength as a unit also\nensures that upper ceiling limit of 50% is not violated. Further,\nroster has to be post-specific and not vacancy based.‖127\n\nHence, the submission that the quota must be reckoned on the basis of the posts\n\nwhich are actually filled up and not the sanctioned posts cannot be accepted.\n\n104 We find no merit in the challenge to the Ratna Prabha Committee report on\n\nthe ground that the collection of data was on the basis of groups A, B, C and D as\n\nopposed to cadres. For one thing, the expression ‗cadre‘ has no fixed meaning\n\nascribed to it in service jurisprudence. But that apart, Nagaraj requires the\n\ncollection of quantifiable data inter alia, on the inadequacy of representation in\n\nservices under the state. Clause 4A of\nArticle 16\nspecifically refers to the\n\ninadequacy of representation in the services under the state. The collection of\n\ndata on the basis of groups A to D does not by its very nature exclude data\n\npertaining to cadres. The state has studied in the present case the extent of\n\nreservation for SCs and STs in groups A to D, consisting of several cadres.\n\nSince, the group includes posts in all the cadres in that group, it can logically be\n\npresumed that the state has collected quantifiable data on the representation of\n\nSCs and STs in promotional posts in the cadres as well.\nSupra 6 at page 261\nPART F\n\n105 Another facet of the matter is that in the judgment of Justice Jeevan Reddy\n\nin Indra Sawhney, it was observed that reservation under\nArticle 16 (4)\ndoes not\n\noperate on communal grounds. Hence, if a member belonging to a reserved\n\ncategory is selected in the general category, the selection would not count\n\nagainst the quota prescribed for the reserved category. The decision in\n\nSabharwal also noted that while candidates belonging to the general category\n\nare not entitled to fill reserved posts, reserved category candidates are entitled to\n\ncompete for posts in the general category. In several group D posts, such as\n\nmunicipal sweepers, the sobering experience of administration is that the\n\noverwhelmingly large segment of applicants consists of persons belonging to the\n\nSCs and STs. Over representation in group D posts as a result of candidates\n\nbelonging to the general category staying away from those posts cannot be a\n\nvalid or logical basis to deny promotion to group D employees recruited from the\n\nreserved category.\n\nF Substantive versus formal equality\n\n106 The core of the present case is based on the constitutional content of\n\nequality.\n\n107 For equality to be truly effective or substantive, the principle must\n\nrecognise existing inequalities in society to overcome them. Reservations\n\nare thus not an exception to the rule of equality of opportunity. They are rather\n\nthe true fulfilment of effective and substantive equality by accounting for the\nPART F\n\nstructural conditions into which people are born. If\nArticle 16(1)\nmerely postulates\n\nthe principle of formal equality of opportunity, then\nArticle 16(4) (by enabling\n\nreservations due to existing inequalities)\nbecomes an exception to the strict rule\n\nof formal equality in\nArticle 16 (1).\nHowever, if\nArticle 16 (1)\nitself sets out the\n\nprinciple of substantive equality (including the recognition of existing inequalities)\n\nthen\nArticle 16 (4)\nbecomes the enunciation of one particular facet of the rule\n\nof substantive equality set out in\nArticle 16 (1).\n\nF.I The Constituent Assembly‟s understanding of\nArticle 16 (4)\n\n(I)\nReservations to overcome existing inequalities in society\n\n(a) There is substantial evidence that the members of the Constituent\n\nAssembly recognised that (i) Indian society suffered from deep structural\n\ninequalities; and (ii) the Constitution would serve as a transformative document to\n\novercome them. One method of overcoming these inequalities is reservations for\n\nthe SCs and STs in the legislatures and state services. Therefore, for the\n\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly who supported reservations, a key\n\nrationale for incorporating reservations for SCs and STs in the Constitution\n\nwas the existence of inequalities in society based on discrimination and\n\nprejudice within the caste structure. This is evidenced by the statements in\n\nsupport of reservations for minorities by members. For example, in the context of\n\nlegislative reservations for minorities Monomohan Das noted:\n\n―… Therefore, it is evident from the Report of the Minorities\nCommittee that it is on account of the extremely low\neducational and economic conditions of the scheduled castes\nand the grievous social disabilities from which they suffer that\nPART F\n\nthe political safeguard of reservation of seats had been\ngranted to them...‖128\n\n(b) Prof. Yashwant Rai used similar statements to support reservations for\n\nbackward communities in employment:\n\n―… Therefore, if you want to give equal status to those\ncommunities which are backward and depressed and on\nwhom injustice has been perpetrated for thousands of\nyears and if you want to establish Indian unity, so that the\ncountry may progress and so that many parties in the country\nmay not mislead the poor, I would say that there should be\na provision in the constitution under which the educated\nHarijans may be provided with employment….‖129\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n(II) Recognition of the insufficiency of formal equality by the Constituent\n\nAssembly\n\n108 During the debates on the principles of equality underlying\nArticle 16 (then\n\ndraft\nArticle 10\n)\n, certain members of the Assembly recognised that in order to\n\ngive true effect to the principle of equality of opportunity, the Constitution had to\n\nexpressly recognise the existing inequalities. For example, Shri Phool Singh\n\nnoted:\n\n―… Much has been made of merit in this case; but equal\nmerit pre-supposes equal opportunity, and I think it goes\nwithout saying that the toiling masses are denied all those\nopportunities which a few literate people living in big cities\nenjoy. To ask the people from the villages to compete\nwith those city people is asking a man on bicycle to\ncompete with another on a motorcycle, which in itself is\n(Volume XI) Debate on 25 August 1949.\n(Volume XI) Debate on 23 August 1949.\nPART F\n\nabsurd. Then again, merit should also have some reference\nto the task to be discharged…‖130 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nSimilarly, P Kakkam stated,\n―… If you take merit alone into account, the Harijans\ncannot come forward. I say in this house, that the\nGovernment must take special steps for the reservation of\nappointment for the Harijans for same years. I expect the\ngovernment will take the necessary steps to give more\nappointments in police and military services also...‖131\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n109 By recognising that formal equality of opportunity will be insufficient in\n\nfulfilling the transformative goal of the Constitution, these members recognised\n\nthat the conception of equality of opportunity must recognise and account for\n\nexisting societal inequalities. The most revealing debates as to how the\n\nConstituent Assembly understood equality of opportunity under the Constitution\n\ntook place on 30 November 1948. Members debated draft\narticle 10 (which\n\nwould go on to become\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution).\nIn these debates, some\n\nmembers understood sub-clause (4) (providing for reservations) as an exception\n\nto the general rule of formal equality enunciated in sub-clause (1). Illustratively,\n\nan articulation of this position was made by Mohammad Ismail Khan, who stated,\n\n―… There can be only one of these two things--either\nthere can be clear equal opportunity or special\nconsideration.\nArticle 10\nsays there shall be equality of\nopportunity, then it emphasises the fact by a negative clause\nthat no citizen shall be discriminated on account of religion or\nrace. It is quite good, but when no indication is given whether\nthis would override\narticle 296\nor\narticle 296\nis independent of\nit, we are certainly left in the lurch. What would be the fate of\nthe minorities? [\nArticle 296\nstated that special\n(Volume XI) Debate on 23 August 1949.\n(Volume VII) Debate on 30 May 1948.\nPART F\n\nconsiderations shall be shown to minorities to ensure\nrepresentation in the services]…‖132 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n110 Dr B R Ambedkar‘s response summarises the different conceptions of\n\nequality of opportunity that the members of the assembly put forward. Dr\n\nAmbedkar argued that the inclusion of sub-clause (4) was a method of\n\nrecognising the demand that mere formal equality in sub-clause (1) would be\n\ninsufficient, and a balance between formal equality of opportunity and the needs\n\nof the disadvantaged classes of society was needed. Dr Ambedkar presciently\n\nobserved:\n\n―… If members were to try and exchange their views on this\nsubject, they will find that there are three points of view which\nit is necessary for us to reconcile if we are to produce a\nworkable proposition which will be accepted by all…\n\nThe first is that there shall be equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens. It is the desire of many Members of this House that\nevery individual who is qualified for a particular post should be\nfree to apply for that post, to sit for examinations and to have\nhis qualifications tested so as to determine whether he is fit for\nthe post or not and that there ought to be no limitations…\n\nAnother view mostly shared by a section of the House is that, if\nthis principle is to be operative--and it ought to be operative in\ntheir judgment to its fullest extent--there ought to be no\nreservations of any sort for any class or community at all…\n\nThen we have quite a massive opinion which insists that,\nalthough theoretically it is good to have the principle that\nthere shall be equality of opportunity, there must at the\nsame time be a provision made for the entry of certain\ncommunities which have so far been outside the\nadministration. As I said, the Drafting Committee had to\nproduce a formula which would reconcile these three points of\nview, firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity,\nsecondly that there shall be reservations in favour of certain\ncommunities which have not so far had a `proper look-in' so to\nsay into the administration…\n(Volume VII) Debate on 30 May 1948.\nPART F\n\nThe view of those who believe and hold that there shall be\nequality of opportunity, has been embodied in sub-clause\n(1) of\nArticle 10.\nIt is a generic principle. At the same time,\nas I said, we had to reconcile this formula with the\ndemand made by certain communities that the\nadministration which has now--for historical reasons--\n\nbeen controlled by one community or a few communities,\nthat situation should disappear and that the others also\nmust have an opportunity of getting into the public\nservices…‖133 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nF.2 The Constitution as a transformative instrument\n\n111 The Constitution is a transformative document. The realization of its\n\ntransformative potential rests ultimately in its ability to breathe life and meaning\n\ninto its abstract concepts. For, above all, the Constitution was intended by its\n\ndraftspersons to be a significant instrument of bringing about social change in a\n\ncaste based feudal society witnessed by centuries of oppression of and\n\ndiscrimination against the marginalised. As our constitutional jurisprudence has\n\nevolved, the realisation of the transformative potential of the Constitution has\n\nbeen founded on the evolution of equality away from its formal underpinnings to\n\nits substantive potential.\n\n112 In the context of reservations, the decision in\nT Devadasan v The Union\n\nof India134\nconstrued\nArticle 16 (4)\nto be a proviso or an exception to\nArticle 16\n\n(1).\nIn a dissent which embodied a vision statement of the Constitution, Justice\n\nSubba Rao held:\n\n―26.\nArticle 14\nlays down the general rule of equality.\nArticle\nis an instance of the application of the general rule with\n(Volume VII) Debate on 30 May 1948.\nAIR 1964 SC 179\nPART F\n\nspecial reference to opportunity of appointments under the\nState. It says that there shall be equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to\nany office under the State… Centuries of calculated\noppression and habitual submission reduced a considerable\nsection of our community to a life of serfdom. It would be well\nnigh impossible to raise their standards if the doctrine of\nequal opportunity was strictly enforced in their case. They\nwould not have any chance if they were made to enter the\nopen field of competition without adventitious aids till such\ntime when they could stand on their own legs. That is why the\nmakers of the Constitution introduced clause (4) in\nArticle 16.\n\nThe expression ―nothing in this article‖ is a legislative device\nto express its intention in a most emphatic way that the power\nconferred thereunder is not limited in any way by the main\nprovision but falls outside it. It has not really carved out an\nexception, but has preserved a power untrammelled by the\nother provisions of the article.‖\n\n113 Subsequently, in N M Thomas, the Constitution Bench adopted an\n\ninterpretation of\nArticles 15\nand\nwhich recognized these provisions as but a\n\nfacet of the doctrine of equality under\nArticle 14.\nJustice K K Mathew observed:\n\n―78…Article 16(4) is capable of being interpreted as an\nexception to\nArticle 16(1)\nif the equality of opportunity\nvisualized in\nArticle 16(1)\nis a sterile one, geared to the\nconcept of numerical equality which takes no account of the\nsocial, economic, educational background of the members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. If equality of\nopportunity guaranteed under\nArticle 16 (1)\nmeans effective\nmaterial equality, then\nArticle 16(4)\nis not an exception to\n\nArticle 16(1).\nIt is only an emphatic way of putting the extent\nto which equality of opportunity could be carried viz., even up\nto the point of making reservation.‖135\n\nIn his own distinctive style, Justice Krishna Iyer observed:\n\n―139. It is platitudinous constitutional law that\nArticles 14\nto 16\nare a common code of guaranteed equality, the first laying\ndown the broad doctrine, the other two applying it to sensitive\nSupra 77 at page 347\nPART F\n\nareas historically important and politically polemical in a\nclimate of communalism and jobbery.‖136\n\nThis court has set out this latter understanding in several cases including\nABS\n\nSangh (Railways) v Union of India137\n.\n\n114 Ultimately, a Bench of nine judges of this Court in Indra Sawhney\n\nrecognized that\nArticle 16 (4)\nis not an exception to but a facet of equality in\n\nArticle 16 (1).\nJustice Jeevan Reddy delivering the judgment of a plurality of four\n\njudges observed:\n\n―741…Article 16(4) is not an exception to\nArticle 16(1)\nbut that\nit is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in\nthe main provision itself...\n\nIn our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority\nin Thomas [(1976) 2 SCC 310, 380 : 1976 SCC (L&S) 227 :\n\n(1976) 1 SCR 906] is the correct one. We too believe that\n\nArticle 16(1)\ndoes permit reasonable classification for\nensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by\nit.‖138\n\n115 Justice Mathew in N M Thomas spoke of the need for proportional equality\n\nas a means of achieving justice. Highlighting the notion that equality under the\n\nConstitution is based on the substantive idea of providing equal access to\n\nresources and opportunities, learned judge observed:\n\n―73. There is no reason why this Court should not also require\nthe State to adopt a standard of proportional equality which\ntakes account of the differing conditions and circumstances of\na class of citizens whenever those conditions and\nIbid at page 369\n(1981) 1 SCC 246\nSupra 13 at page 691\nPART G\n\ncircumstances stand in the way of their equal access to the\nenjoyment of basic rights or claims.‖139\n\nCarrying these precepts further Justice S H Kapadia (as the learned judge then\n\nwas) speaking for the Constitution Bench in Nagaraj observed:\n\n―51…Therefore, there are three criteria to judge the basis of\ndistribution, namely, rights, deserts or need. These three\ncriteria can be put under two concepts of equality— ―formal\nequality‖ and ―proportional equality‖. ―Formal equality‖ means\nthat law treats everyone equal and does not favour anyone\neither because he belongs to the advantaged section of the\nsociety or to the disadvantaged section of the society.\nConcept of ―proportional equality‖ expects the States to take\naffirmative action in favour of disadvantaged sections of the\nsociety within the framework of liberal democracy.‖140\n\nSocial justice, in other words, is a matter involving the distribution of benefits and\n\nburdens.\n\nG Efficiency in administration\n\n116 Critics of affirmative action programs in government services argue that\n\nsuch programs adversely impact the overall competence or ―efficiency‖ of\n\ngovernment administration. Critics contend that the only method to ensure\n\n―efficiency‖ in the administration of government is to use a ―merit‖ based\n\napproach – whereby candidates that fulfil more, seemingly ―neutral‖, criteria than\n\nothers are given opportunities in government services. The constitutional\n\njustification for this ―efficiency‖ argument is centred around\nArticle 335.\nSupra 77 at page 346\nSupra 6 at page 250\nPART G\n\n―335. The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes\nand the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration,\nconsistently with the maintenance of efficiency of\nadministration, in the making of appointments to services and\nposts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State:\n\n[Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent in making of\nany provision in favour of the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes for relaxation in qualifying\nmarks in any examination or lowering the standards of\nevaluation, for reservation in matters of promotion to any\nclass or classes of services or posts in connection with the\naffairs of the Union or of a State.].‖\n\nThe proviso was inserted by the\nConstitution (Eighty-second Amendment) Act\n\n2000.\n\n117 The substantive part of\nArticle 335\ncontains a mandate : a requirement to\n\ntake into consideration the claims of SCs and STs in making appointments to\n\nservices and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State.\n\nConsideration is much broader in its ambit than reservation. The consideration of\n\ntheir claims to appointment is to be in a manner consistent with maintaining the\n\nefficiency of administration. The proviso specifically protects provisions in favour\n\nof the SCs and STs for: (i) relaxing qualifying marks in an examination; (ii)\n\nlowering the standards of evaluation; or (iii) reservation in matters of promotion.\n\nReservation is encompassed within the special provision but the universe of the\n\nlatter is wider.\n\n118 The proviso recognises that special measures need to be adopted for\n\nconsidering the claims of SCs and STs in order to bring them to a level playing\nPART G\n\nfield. Centuries of discrimination and prejudice suffered by the SCs and STs in a\n\nfeudal, caste oriented societal structure poses real barriers of access to\n\nopportunity. The proviso contains a realistic recognition that unless special\n\nmeasures are adopted for the SCs and STs, the mandate of the Constitution for\n\nthe consideration of their claim to appointment will remain illusory. The proviso, in\n\nother words, is an aid of fostering the real and substantive right to equality to the\n\nSCs and STs. It protects the authority of the Union and the States to adopt any of\n\nthese special measures, to effectuate a realistic (as opposed to a formal)\n\nconsideration of their claims to appointment in services and posts under the\n\nUnion and the states. The proviso is not a qualification to the substantive part of\n\nArticle 335\nbut it embodies a substantive effort to realise substantive equality.\n\nThe proviso also emphasises that the need to maintain the efficiency of\n\nadministration cannot be construed as a fetter on adopting these special\n\nmeasures designed to uplift and protect the welfare of the SCs and STs.\n\n119 The Constitution does not define what the framers meant by the phrase\n\n―efficiency of administration‖.\nArticle 335\ncannot be construed on the basis of a\n\nstereotypical assumption that roster point promotees drawn from the SCs and\n\nSTs are not efficient or that efficiency is reduced by appointing them. This is\n\nstereotypical because it masks deep rooted social prejudice. The benchmark for\n\nthe efficiency of administration is not some disembodied, abstract ideal measured\n\nby the performance of a qualified open category candidate. Efficiency of\n\nadministration in the affairs of the Union or of a State must be defined in an\n\ninclusive sense, where diverse segments of society find representation as a true\nPART G\n\naspiration of governance by and for the people. If, as we hold, the Constitution\n\nmandates realisation of substantive equality in the engagement of the\n\nfundamental rights with the directive principles, inclusion together with the\n\nrecognition of the plurality and diversity of the nation constitutes a valid\n\nconstitutional basis for defining efficiency. Our benchmarks will define our\n\noutcomes. If this benchmark of efficiency is grounded in exclusion, it will produce\n\na pattern of governance which is skewed against the marginalised. If this\n\nbenchmark of efficiency is grounded in equal access, our outcomes will reflect\n\nthe commitment of the Constitution to produce a just social order. Otherwise, our\n\npast will haunt the inability of our society to move away from being deeply\n\nunequal to one which is founded on liberty and fraternity. Hence, while\n\ninterpreting\nArticle 335\n, it is necessary to liberate the concept of efficiency from a\n\none sided approach which ignores the need for and the positive effects of the\n\ninclusion of diverse segments of society on the efficiency of administration of the\n\nUnion or of a State. Establishing the position of the SCs and STs as worthy\n\nparticipants in affairs of governance is intrinsic to an equal citizenship. Equal\n\ncitizenship recognizes governance which is inclusive but also ensures that those\n\nsegments of our society which have suffered a history of prejudice, discrimination\n\nand oppression have a real voice in governance. Since inclusion is inseparable\n\nfrom a well governed society, there is, in our view, no antithesis between\n\nmaintaining the efficiency of administration and considering the claims of the SCs\n\nand STs to appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of\n\nthe Union or of a State.\nPART G\n\n120 This part of the philosophy of the Constitution was emphasized in a\n\npowerful exposition contained in the judgment of Justice O Chinnappa Reddy in\n\nK C Vasanth Kumar v State of Karnataka141 (―K C Vasanth Kumar‖). The\n\nlearned Judge held:\n\n―35. One of the results of the superior, elitist approach is that\nthe question of reservation is invariably viewed as the conflict\nbetween the meritarian principle and the compensatory\nprinciple. No, it is not so. The real conflict is between the\nclass of people, who have never been in or who have already\nmoved out of the desert of poverty, illiteracy and\nbackwardness and are entrenched in the oasis of convenient\nliving and those who are still in the desert and want to reach\nthe oasis. There is not enough fruit in the garden and so\nthose who are in, want to keep out those who are out. The\ndisastrous consequences of the so-called meritarian principle\nto the vast majority of the under-nourished, poverty-stricken,\nbarely literate and vulnerable people of our country are too\nobvious to be stated. And, what is merit? There is no merit in\na system which brings about such consequences…‖142\n\nSpeaking of efficiency, the learned Judge held:\n\n―36. Efficiency is very much on the lips of the privileged\nwhenever reservation is mentioned…\n\nOne would think that the civil service is a Heavenly Paradise\ninto which only the archangels, the chosen of the elite, the\nvery best may enter and may be allowed to go higher up the\nladder. But the truth is otherwise. The truth is that the civil\nservice is no paradise and the upper echelons belonging to\nthe chosen classes are not necessarily models of efficiency.\nThe underlying assumption that those belonging to the upper\ncastes and classes, who are appointed to the non-reserved\nposts will, because of their presumed merit, ―naturally‖\nperform better than those who have been appointed to the\nreserved posts and that the clear stream of efficiency will be\npolluted by the infiltration of the latter into the sacred\nprecincts is a vicious assumption, typical of the superior\napproach of the elitist classes…‖143\n(1985) Supp. SCC 714\nIbid at pages 737-738\nIbid at page 738\nPART G\n\n121 The substantive right to equality is for all segments of society.\nArticles 15\n\n(4)\nand\n16 (4)\nrepresent the constitutional aspiration to ameliorate the conditions\n\nof the SCs and STs. While, we are conscious of the fact that the decision in Indra\n\nSawhney did not accept K C Vasanth Kumar144 on certain aspects, the\n\nobservations have been cited by us to explain the substantive relationship\n\nbetween equal opportunity and merit. It embodies the fundamental philosophy of\n\nthe Constitution towards advancing substantive equality.\n\n122 An assumption implicit in the critique of reservations is that awarding\n\nopportunities in government services based on “merit” results in an\n\nincrease in administrative efficiency. Firstly, it must be noted that\n\nadministrative efficiency is an outcome of the actions taken by officials after they\n\nhave been appointed or promoted and is not tied to the selection method itself.\n\nThe argument that one selection method produces officials capable of taking\n\nbetter actions than a second method must be empirically proven based on an\n\nevaluation of the outcomes produced by officials selected through both methods.\n\nSecondly, arguments that attack reservations on the grounds of efficiency equate\n\n―merit‖ with candidates who perform better than other candidates on seemingly\n\n―neutral‖ criteria, e.g. standardised examinations. Thus, candidates who score\n\nbeyond a particular ―cut-off point‖ are considered ―meritorious‖ and others are\n\n―non-meritorious‖. However, this is a distorted understanding of the function\n\n―merit‖ plays in society.\nSupra 139 at paragraph 613\nPART G\n\n123 As Amartya Sen notes in his chapter on ―Merit and Justice‖, 145 the idea of\n\nmerit is fundamentally derivative of our views of a good society. Sen notes,\n\n―Actions may be rewarded for the good they do, and a\nsystem of remunerating the activities that generate good\nconsequences would, it is presumed, tend to produce a better\nsociety. The rationale of incentive structures may be more\ncomplex than this simple statement suggests, but the idea of\nmerit in this instrumental perspective relates to the motivation\nof producing better results. In this view, actions are\nmeritorious in a derivative and contingent way,\ndepending on the good they do, and more particularly,\nthe good that can be brought about by rewarding them….\n\n…The concept of merit is deeply contingent on our views of a\ngood society. Indeed, the notion of merit is fundamentally\nderivative, and thus cannot be qualified and contingent. There\nis some elementary tension between (1) the inclination to\nsee merit in fixed and absolute terms, and (2) the\nultimately instrumental character of merit – its\ndependence on the concept of “the good” in the relevant\nsociety.\n\nThis basic contrast is made more intense by the tendency, in\npractice, to characterise ―merit‖ in inflexible forms reflecting\nvalues and priorities of the past, often in sharp conflict with\nconceptions that would be needed for seeing merit in the\ncontext of contemporary objectives and concerns…\n\nEven though the typical “objective functions” that are\nimplicitly invoked in most countries to define and assess\nwhat is to count as merit tend to be indifferent to (or\nnegligent of) distributive aspects of outcomes, there is\nno necessity to accept that ad hoc characterisation. This\nis not a matter of a “natural order” of “merit” that is\nindependent of our value system….‖ (Emphasis supplied)\n\n124 Once we understand ―merit‖ as instrumental in achieving goods that we as\n\na society value, we see that the equation of ―merit‖ with performance at a few\n\nnarrowly defined criteria is incomplete. A meritocratic system is one that rewards\n\nactions that result in the outcomes that we as a society value.\nSen A, Merit and Justice, in Arrow, KJ, MERITOCRACY AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY (Princeton University Press\n2000) (Amartya Sen, Merit and Justice).\nPART G\n\n125 For example, performance in standardised examinations (distinguished\n\nfrom administrative efficiency) now becomes one among many of the actions that\n\nthe process of appointments in government services seeks to achieve. Based on\n\nthe text of\nArticles 335\n,\nArticles 16 (4)\n, and\n, it is evident that the uplifting of the\n\nSCs and STs through employment in government services, and having an\n\ninclusive government are other outcomes that the process of appointments in\n\ngovernment services seeks to achieve. Sen gives exactly such an example.\n\n―If, for example, the conceptualisation of a good society\nincludes the absence of serious economic inequalities, then\nin the characterisation of instrumental goodness,\nincluding the assessment of what counts as merit, note\nwould have to be taken of the propensity of putative\nmerit to lessen – or to generate – economic inequality. In\nthis case, the rewarding of merit cannot be done independent\nof its distributive consequences.\n\n…\n\nA system of rewarding of merit may well generate inequalities\nof well-being and of other advantages. But, as was argued\nearlier, much would depend on the nature of the\nconsequences that are sought, on the basis of which merits\nare to be characterised. If the results desired have a strong\ndistributive component, with a preference for equality,\nthen in assessing merits (through judging the generating\nresults, including its distributive aspects), concerns\nabout distribution and inequality would enter the\nevaluation.‖146 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThus, the providing of reservations for SCs and the STs is not at odds with the\n\nprinciple of meritocracy. ―Merit‖ must not be limited to narrow and inflexible\n\ncriteria such as one‘s rank in a standardised exam, but rather must flow from the\n\nactions a society seeks to reward, including the promotion of equality in society\nIbid\nPART G\n\nand diversity in public administration. In fact, Sen argues that there is a risk to\n\nexcluding equality from the outcomes.\n\n―In most versions of modern meritocracy, however, the\nselected objectives tend to be almost exclusively\noriented towards aggregate achievements (without any\npreference against inequality), and sometimes the\nobjectives chosen are even biased (often implicitly) towards\nthe interests of more fortunate groups (favouring the\noutcomes that are more preferred by ―talented‖ and\n―successful‖ sections of the population. This can reinforce\nand augment the tendency towards inequality that might\nbe present even with an objective function that inter alia,\nattaches some weight to lower inequality levels.‖147\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n126 The Proviso to\nArticle 335\nof the Constitution seeks to mitigate this risk by\n\nallowing for provisions to be made for relaxing the marks in qualifying exams in\n\nthe case of candidates from the SCs and the STs. If the government‘s sole\n\nconsideration in appointments was to appoint individuals who were considered\n\n―talented‖ or ―successful‖ in standardised examinations, by virtue of the inequality\n\nin access to resources and previous educational training (existing inequalities in\n\nsociety), the stated constitutional goal of uplifting these sections of society and\n\nhaving a diverse administration would be undermined. Thus, a ―meritorious‖\n\ncandidate is not merely one who is ―talented‖ or ―successful‖ but also one whose\n\nappointment fulfils the constitutional goals of uplifting members of the SCs and\n\nSTs and ensuring a diverse and representative administration.\nIbid\nPART G\n\n127 It is well settled that existing inequalities in society can lead to a seemingly\n\n―neutral‖ system discriminating in favour of privileged candidates. As Marc\n\nGalanter notes, three broad kinds of resources are necessary to produce the\n\nresults in competitive exams that qualify as indicators of ―merit‖. These are:\n\n―… (a) economic resources (for prior education, training,\nmaterials, freedom from work etc.); (b) social and cultural\nresources (networks of contacts, confidence, guidance and\nadvice, information, etc.); and (c) intrinsic ability and hard\nwork...‖ 148\n\n128 The first two criteria are evidently not the products of a candidate‘s own\n\nefforts but rather the structural conditions into which they are born. By the\n\naddition of upliftment of SCs and STs in the moral compass of merit in\n\ngovernment appointments and promotions, the Constitution mitigates the risk that\n\nthe lack of the first two criteria will perpetuate the structural inequalities existing in\n\nsociety.\n\n129 The Ratna Prabha Committee report considers in Chapter III, the\n\nrelationship between reservation in promotion and maintenance of efficiency in\n\nadministration. Finally, it concludes:\n\n―3.12: Conclusion:\n\nKarnataka has been showing high performance in all the\nsectors of development viz., finance, health, education,\nindustry, services, etc., to support sustainable economic\ngrowth. The analysis on performance of the state in economic\ndevelopment clearly indicates that reservation in promotions\nhas not affected the overall efficiency of administration.\nGalanter M, Competing Equalities: Law and the Backward Classes in India, (Oxford University Press, New\nDelhi 1984), cited by Deshpande S, Inclusion versus excellence: Caste and the framing of fair access in\nIndian higher education, 40:1 South African Review of Sociology 127-147.\nPART H\n\n130 Moreover, even in a formal legal sense, promotions, including those in\n\nrespect of roster points, are made on the basis of seniority-cum-merit and a\n\ncandidate to be promoted has to meet this criteria [See in this context Rule 19(3)\n\nA and D of the Karnataka Civil Services General Recruitment Rules 1977 which\n\nstates that subject to other provisions all appointments by promotion shall be on\n\nan officiating basis for a period of one year and at the end of the period of\n\nofficiation, if appointing authority considers the person not suitable for promotion,\n\nshe/he may be reverted back to the post held prior to the promotion]. A candidate\n\non promotion has to serve a statutory period of officiation before being confirmed.\n\nThis rule applies across the board including to roster point promotees. This\n\nensures that the efficiency of administration is, in any event, not adversely\n\naffected.\n\nH The issue of creamy layer\n\n131 At the outset, we analyse the submission of Ms Indira Jaising, learned\n\nSenior Counsel that the concept of creamy layer is inapplicable to the SCs and\n\nSTs. This submission which has been urged by the learned Counsel is founded\n\non two hypotheses which we have extracted below from the written submissions:\n\n―(i) This Court in Indra Sawhney seems to suggest that the\ncreamy layer should be excluded, however there was no\nunanimity for determining what is creamy layer. Some judges\ntook the view that the criteria for creamy layer exclusion is\nsocial advancement (i.e. based on social basis, educational,\nand economical basis) and others took the view that it will be\neconomic basis alone. It is submitted that it must be kept in\nmind that the said judgment related only to OBCs; and\n\n(ii) Jarnail is not an authority for the proposition that the\ncreamy layer principle applies to SCs and STs. It dealt only\nPART H\n\nwith the competence of the Parliament to enact a law in\nrelation to creamy layer without affecting Articles 341 and\n\n342.‖\n\n132 Dr Dhavan, learned Senior Counsel in his response has urged that the\n\nabove submissions are incorrect because:\n\n(i) Indra Sawhney decided the issue of creamy layer as a principle of equality;\n\nand\n\n(ii) Jarnail affirmed that if Nagaraj is rightly applied, creamy layer is a principle\n\nof equality and of the basic structure.\n\n133 Ms Jaising‘s argument is based on the decision in Chinnaiah that the SCs\n\nand STs cannot be split or bifurcated and the adoption of the creamy layer\n\nprinciple would amount to a spilt in the homogenous groups of the SCs and STs.\n\nThis argument according to Dr Dhavan, was rejected in Jarnail by the\n\nConstitution Bench.\n\n134 As a Bench of two judges we are bound by the decision in Indra Sawhney\n\nas indeed, we are by the construction placed on that decision by the Constitution\n\nBenches in Nagaraj and Jarnail. Construing the decision in Indra Sawhney.\n\nNagaraj held:\n\n―120…Concept of egalitarian equality is the concept of\nproportional equality and it expects the States to take\naffirmative action in favour of disadvantaged sections of\nsociety within the framework of democratic polity. In Indra\nSawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1\n: (1992) 22 ATC 385] all the Judges except Pandian, J. held\nthat the ―means test‖ should be adopted to exclude the\nPART H\n\ncreamy layer from the protected group earmarked for\nreservation. In Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 :\n\n1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] this Court has,\ntherefore, accepted caste as a determinant of backwardness\nand yet it has struck a balance with the principle of secularism\nwhich is the basic feature of the Constitution by bringing in\nthe concept of creamy layer. Views have often been\nexpressed in this Court that caste should not be the\ndeterminant of backwardness and that the economic criteria\nalone should be the determinant of backwardness. As stated\nabove, we are bound by the decision in Indra Sawhney [1992\nSupp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC\n385] . The question as to the ―determinant‖ of backwardness\ncannot be gone into by us in view of the binding decision. In\naddition to the above requirements this Court in Indra\nSawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1\n: (1992) 22 ATC 385] has evolved numerical benchmarks like\nceiling limit of 50% based on post-specific roster coupled with\nthe concept of replacement to provide immunity against the\ncharge of discrimination.‖149\n\nThen again, in paragraphs 121, 122 and 123, the Constitution Bench held:\n\n―121. The impugned constitutional amendments by which\n\nArticles 16 (4A)\nand\n16 (4B)\nhave been inserted flow from\n\nArticle 16(4).\nThey do not alter the structure of\nArticle 16(4).\n\nThey retain the controlling factors or the compelling reasons,\nnamely, backwardness and inadequacy of representation\nwhich enables the States to provide for reservation keeping in\nmind the overall efficiency of the State administration under\n\nArticle 335.\nThese impugned amendments are confined only\nto SCs and STs. They do not obliterate any of the\nconstitutional requirements, namely, ceiling limit of 50%\n(quantitative limitation), the concept of creamy layer\n(qualitative exclusion), the sub-classification between OBCs\non one hand and SCs and STs on the other hand as held\nin Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S)\nSupp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] , the concept of post-based\nroster with inbuilt concept of replacement as held in R.K.\nSabharwa [(1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 : (1995)\n29 ATC 481] .\n\n122. We reiterate that the ceiling limit of 50%, the concept of\ncreamy layer and the compelling reasons, namely,\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation and overall\nSupra 6 at pages 277-278\nPART H\n\nadministrative efficiency are all constitutional requirements\nwithout which the structure of equality of opportunity in\nArticle\nwould collapse.\n\n123. However, in this case, as stated above, the main issue\nconcerns the ―extent of reservation‖. In this regard the State\nconcerned will have to show in each case the existence of the\ncompelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\nrepresentation and overall administrative efficiency before\nmaking provision for reservation. As stated above, the\nimpugned provision is an enabling provision. The State is not\nbound to make reservation for SCs/STs in matters of\npromotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion\nand make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable\ndata showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of\nrepresentation of that class in public employment in addition\nto compliance with\nArticle 335.\nIt is made clear that even if the\nState has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will\nhave to see that its reservation provision does not lead to\nexcessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50% or\nobliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation\nindefinitely.‖150\n\n135 The reference before the Constitution Bench in Jarnail arose out of an\n\ninitial reference by a two judge Bench in\nState of Tripura v Jayanta\n\nChakraborty (―State of Tripura‖\n)151 and then by a three judge Bench in\nState of\n\nMaharashtra v Vijay Ghogre152\n. The order in State of Tripura states:\n\n―2…However, apart from the clamour for revisit, further\nquestions were also raised about application of the principle\nof creamy layer in situations of competing claims within the\nsame races, communities, groups or parts thereof of SC/STs\nnotified by the President under\nArticles 341\nand\nof the\nConstitution of India.‖153\n\n136 Before the Constitution Bench in Jarnail, the learned Attorney General\n\nspecifically raised the following arguments:\nIbid at pages 278 -280\n(2018) 1 SCC 146\n(2018) 15 SCC 64\nSupra 149 at pages 147-148\nPART H\n\n―3…according to the learned Attorney General, the creamy\nlayer concept has not been applied in\nIndra Sawhney\n(1) [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India\n, 1992 Supp (3) SCC 217\n: 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1] to the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes and Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India,\n(2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] has misread\nthe aforesaid judgment to apply this concept to the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes. According to the learned\nAttorney General, once the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes have been set out in the Presidential List,\nthey shall be deemed to be Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes, and the said List cannot be altered by anybody except\nParliament under\nArticles 341\nand\n342.\n\nThe learned Attorney\nGeneral also argued that\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of\nIndia\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] does\nnot indicate any test for determining adequacy of\nrepresentation in service.\nAccording to him, it is important that\nwe lay down that the test be the test of proportion of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the population in\nIndia at all stages of promotion, and for this purpose, the\nroster that has been referred to in R.K. Sabharwal v. State of\nPunjab [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab, (1995) 2 SCC 745\n: 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] can be utilised. Other counsel who\nargued, apart from the learned Attorney General, have, with\ncertain nuances, reiterated the same arguments.‖154\n\nThe decision in Jarnail specifically addressed the issue of creamy layer:\n\n―28. Therefore, when\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n,\n(2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] applied the\ncreamy layer test to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nin exercise of application of the basic structure test to uphold\nthe constitutional amendments leading to\nArticles 16 (4A)\nand\n\n16 (4B)\n, it did not in any manner interfere with Parliament's\npower under\nArticle 341\nor\nArticle 342.\n\nWe are, therefore,\nclearly of the opinion that this part of the judgment does not\nneed to be revisited, and consequently, there is no need to\nrefer\nNagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212\n: (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] to a seven-Judge Bench.\n\nWe\nmay also add at this juncture that\nNagaraj [M.\nNagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC\n(L&S) 1013] is a unanimous judgment of five learned Judges\nof this Court which has held sway since the year 2006. This\njudgment has been repeatedly followed and applied…‖155\nSupra 49 at pages 407-408\nIbid at page 426\nPART H\n\nJustice Rohinton Nariman speaking for the Constitution Bench in Jarnail\n\nexplained the reason for applying the creamy layer principle:\n\n―25. However, when it comes to the creamy layer principle, it\nis important to note that this principle sounds in\nArticles 14\n\nand\n16 (1)\n, as unequals within the same class are being\ntreated equally with other members of that class.‖\n\n137 We are thus unable to subscribe to the submission that Jarnail is not per\n\ncurium on the issue of creamy layer. For one thing, Jarnail specifically examined\n\nthe decision in Indra Sawhney, noticing that eight of the nine learned Judges\n\napplied the creamy layer principle as a facet of the larger equality principle. In\n\nfact, the decision in Indra Sawhney II v Union of India156 (―Indra Sawhney II‖)\n\nsummarised the judgments in Indra Sawhney I on the aspect of creamy layer.\n\nThe judgment in Jarnail approved Indra Sawhney II when it held that the creamy\n\nlayer principle sounds in\nArticles 14\nand\n16 (1):\n\n―12.\nIn para 27 of the said judgment, the three-Judge Bench\nof this Court clearly held that the creamy layer principle\nsounds in\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\nas follows: [Indra Sawhney\n(2) case [\nIndra Sawhney (2) v. Union of India\n, (2000) 1 SCC\n168 : 2000 SCC (L&S) 1] , SCC p. 190, para 27]\n―(i) Equals and unequals, twin aspects\n\n27. As the ―creamy layer‖ in the backward class is to\nbe treated ―on a par‖ with the forward classes and is\nnot entitled to benefits of reservation, it is obvious that\nif the ―creamy layer‖ is not excluded, there will be\ndiscrimination and violation of\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\n\ninasmuch as equals (forwards and creamy layer of\nBackward Classes) cannot be treated unequally.\n\nAgain, non-exclusion of creamy layer will also be\nviolative of\nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\nand\n16(4)\nof the\nConstitution of India since unequals (the creamy\nlayer) cannot be treated as equals, that is to say,\nequal to the rest of the backward class…\n(2000)1 SCC 168\nPART H\n\nThus, any executive or legislative action refusing to exclude\nthe creamy layer from the benefits of reservation will be\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\nand also of\nArticle 16(4).\nWe\nshall examine the validity of Sections 3, 4 and 6 in the light of\nthe above principle. (emphasis in original)‖157\n\nJarnail discussed the decision in Chinnaiah and held that it dealt with the lack of\n\nlegislative competence on the part of the State legislatures to create sub-\n\ncategories among the Presidential lists under\nArticles 341\nand\n342.\nThe decision\n\nin Jarnail therefore held that Chinnaiah did not deal with any of the aspects on\n\nwhich the constitutional amendments were upheld in Nagaraj and hence it was\n\nnot necessary for Nagaraj to refer to Chinnaiah at all. In this view of the matter,\n\nwe are clearly of the view that Jarnail, on a construction of Indra Sawhney holds\n\nthat the creamy layer principle is a principle of equality.\n\n138 Though, we have not accepted the above submission which was urged by\n\nMs Jaising on behalf of the intervenors, we will have to decide as to whether the\n\nReservation Act 2018 is unconstitutional. The challenge in the present case is to\n\nthe validity of the Reservation Act 2018 which provides for consequential\n\nseniority. In other words, the nature or extent of reservation granted to the SCs\n\nand STs at the entry level in appointment is not under challenge. The\n\nReservation Act 2018 adopts the principle that consequential seniority is not an\n\nadditional benefit but a consequence of the promotion which is granted to the\n\nSCs and STs. In protecting consequential seniority as an incident of promotion,\n\nthe Reservation Act 2018 constitutes an exercise of the enabling power conferred\n\nby\nArticle 16 (4A).\nThe concept of creamy layer has no relevance to the grant of\nSupra 49 at page 415\nPART H\n\nconsequential seniority. There is merit in the submission of the State of\n\nKarnataka that progression in a cadre based on promotion cannot be treated as\n\nthe acquisition of creamy layer status. The decision in Jarnail rejected the\n\nsubmission that a member of an SC or ST who reaches a higher post no longer\n\nhas a taint of untouchability or backwardness. The Constitution Bench declined to\n\naccept the submission on the ground that it related to the validity of\nArticle 16\n\n(4A)\nand held thus:\n\n―34…We may hasten to add that Shri Dwivedi‘s argument\ncannot be confused with the concept of ―creamy layer‖ which,\nas has been pointed out by us hereinabove, applies to\npersons within the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes\nwho no longer require reservation, as opposed to posts\nbeyond the entry stage, which may be occupied by\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled\nTribes.‖158 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n139 In sustaining the validity of\nArticles 16 (4A)\nand\n16 (4B)\nagainst a\n\nchallenge of violating the basic structure, Nagaraj applied the test of width and\n\nthe test of identity. The Constitution Bench ruled that the catch-up rule and\n\nconsequential seniority are not constitutional requirements. They were held not to\n\nbe implicit in clauses (1) to (4) of\nArticle 16.\nNagaraj held that they are not\n\nconstitutional limitations or principles but are concepts derived from service\n\njurisprudence. Hence, neither the obliteration of those concepts nor their insertion\n\nwould violate the equality code contained in\nArticles 14\n, 15\nand\n16.\nThe principle\n\npostulated in Nagaraj is that consequential seniority is a concept purely based in\n\nservice jurisprudence. The incorporation of consequential seniority would hence\n\nnot violate the constitutional mandate of equality. This being the true\nSupra 49 at page 430\nPART I\n\nconstitutional position, the protection of consequential seniority as an incident of\n\npromotion does not require the application of the creamy layer test.\nArticles 16\n\n(4A)\nand\n16 (4B)\nwere held to not obliterate any of the constitutional limitations\n\nand to fulfil the width test. In the above view of the matter, it is evident that the\n\nconcept of creamy layer has no application in assessing the validity of the\n\nReservation Act 2018 which is designed to protect consequential seniority upon\n\npromotion of persons belonging to the SCs and STs.\n\nI Retrospectivity\n\n140 Sections 3 and 4 of the Reservation Act 2018 came into force on 17 June\n\n1995. The other provisions came into force ―at once‖ as provided in\nSection 1(2)\n.\n\nSection 4 stipulates that the consequential seniority already granted to\n\ngovernment servants belonging to the SCs and STs in accordance with the\n\nreservation order with effect from 27 April 1978 shall be valid and shall be\n\nprotected. In this context, we must note from the earlier decisions of this Court\n\nthat:\n\n(i) The decision in Virpal Singh held that the catch-up rule would be applied\n\nonly from 10 February 1995 which was the date of the judgment in\n\nSabharwal;\n\n(ii) The decision in Ajit Singh II specifically protected the promotions which were\n\ngranted before 1 March 1996 without following the catch-up rule; and\nPART J\n\n(iii) In Badappanavar, promotions of reserved candidates based on\n\nconsequential seniority which took place before 1 March 1996 were\n\nspecifically protected.\n\n141 Since promotions granted prior to 1 March 1996 were protected, it was\n\nlogical for the legislature to protect consequential seniority. The object of the\n\nReservation Act 2018 is to accord consequential seniority to promotees against\n\nroster points. In this view of the matter, we find no reason to hold that the\n\nprovisions in regard to retrospectivity in the Ratna Prabha Committee report are\n\neither arbitrary or unconstitutional.\n\n142 The benefit of consequential seniority has been extended from the date of\n\nthe Reservation Order 1978 under which promotions based on reservation were\n\naccorded.\n\nJ Over representation in KPTCL and PWD\n\n143 The Ratna Prabha Committee collected data from thirty one departments\n\nof the State Government of Karnataka. It has been pointed out on behalf of the\n\nState that corporations such as KPTCL and other public sector undertakings fall\n\nwithin the administrative control of one of the departments of the State\n\ngovernment. The position in thirty one departments was taken as representative\n\nof the position in public employment under the State. The over representation in\n\nKPTCL and PWD has been projected by the petitioners with reference to the total\n\nnumber of posts which have been filled. On the other hand, the quota is fixed and\n\nthe roster applies as regards the total sanctioned posts as held in Sabharwal and\nPART K\n\nNagaraj. On the contrary, the data submitted by the State of Karnataka indicates\n\nthat if consequential seniority is not allowed, there would be under representation\n\nof the reserved categories. Finally, it may also be noted that under the\n\nGovernment Order dated 13 April 1999, reservation in promotion in favour of SC‘s\n\nand ST‘s has been provided until the representation for these categories reaches\n\n15 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively. The State has informed the Court that\n\nthe above Government Order is applicable to KPTCL and PWD, as well.\n\nK Conclusion\n\n144 For the above reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the challenge\n\nto the constitutional validity of the Reservation Act 2018 is lacking in substance.\n\nFollowing the decision in B K Pavitra I, the State government duly carried out the\n\nexercise of collating and analysing data on the compelling factors adverted to by\n\nthe Constitution Bench in Nagaraj. The Reservation Act 2018 has cured the\n\ndeficiency which was noticed by B K Pavitra I in respect of the Reservation Act\n\n2002. The Reservation Act 2018 does not amount to a usurpation of judicial\n\npower by the state legislature. It is Nagaraj and Jarnail compliant. The\n\nReservation Act 2018 is a valid exercise of the enabling power conferred by\n\nArticle 16 (4A)\nof the Constitution.\n\n145 We therefore find no merit in the batch of writ petitions as the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the Reservation Act 2018 has been upheld. They shall stand\n\ndismissed. Accordingly, the review petitions and miscellaneous applications shall\nPART K\n\nalso stand dismissed in view of the judgment in the present case. There shall be\n\nno order as to costs. All pending applications are disposed of.\n\n146 Before concluding, the Court records its appreciation of the erudite\n\nsubmissions of the learned Counsel who have ably assisted the Court. We\n\ndeeply value the assistance rendered by Dr Rajeev Dhavan and Mr Shekhar\n\nNaphade, learned Senior Counsel and Mr Puneet Jain, learned Counsel who led\n\nthe arguments on behalf of the Petitioners. We acknowledge the valuable\n\nassistance rendered to the Court by Ms Indira Jaising, Mr Basava Prabhu S Patil,\n\nMr Dinesh Dwivedi, Mr Nidhesh Gupta and Mr V Lakshminarayana, learned\n\nSenior Counsel.\n\n…...…..…....…........……………….…........J.\n[Uday Umesh Lalit]\n\n.…….……...…...….......………………........J.\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nMay 10, 2019.",
