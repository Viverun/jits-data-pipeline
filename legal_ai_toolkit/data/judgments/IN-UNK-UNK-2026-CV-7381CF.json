This appeal is directed against the judgment dated 9 th February, 2004\npassed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi („the trial\nCourt‟) in Sessions Case No.110/03 arising out of FIR No.975/2000\nregistered at Police Station („PS‟) Malviya Nagar, New Delhi convicting the\nAppellant of the offences under \nSections 302\n, \n364\n and \n201\n of the Indian\nPenal Code („\nIPC\n‟) and the consequent order on sentence dated 10 th\nFebruary, 2004 whereby for the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC, the\nAppellant was sentenced to life imprisonment along with fine of Rs.95,000/-\n\nand in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 1 of 40\n\n („RI‟) for four years; for the offence under \nSection 364\n IPC, to undergo life\nimprisonment; and for the offence under \nSection 201\n IPC, to undergo RI for\nfour years along with fine of Rs.5,000/-, and in default of payment to further\nundergo RI for one year. It was directed that in case the fine amount was\ndeposited, Rs.90,000/- will be paid to Mr Vinod K. Chaudhary (PW-1), the\nfather of the deceased. All the sentences were directed to run concurrently.\n\n2. The Appellant, who was arrayed as Accused No.3 („A-3‟) was sent up for\ntrial along with two other co-accused i.e. Gyan Prakash („A-1‟) and Amit\nSingh („A-2‟). However, by the impugned judgment, A-1 and A-2 were\nacquitted of all the offences with which they were charged.\n\nCharge\n\n3. The charge against all the three accused persons was, first, that they\nentered into a criminal conspiracy on or before 28th October, 2000 to abduct\nand murder Manish Chaudhary („the deceased‟), thereby committing an\noffence under \nSection 120-B\n IPC; secondly, that they abducted the deceased\nand then murdered him by stabbing and strangulation and disposed of his\ndead body in a well in village Simbhavali after removing his belongings,\nthereby committing offences punishable under \nSections 302\n/\n364\n/\n201\n/\n404\n\nread with \nSection 120-B\n IPC.\n\nDeceased goes missing\n\n4. The case of the prosecution, as it emerged from the version of PW-1, was\nthat PW-1 had an office at Ansari Road, Darya Ganj, Delhi, where he\noperated his family business of cargo and shipping. The deceased was his\nson and was also operating the business along with him. According to PW-1,\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 2 of 40\n\n on 28th October, 2000, he had left his office at around 5.15 pm, and at that\ntime, the deceased, Raj Gupta (PW-23), the driver of the company and a few\nother staff members had stayed back in the office.\n\n5. The deceased purportedly left the office premises at around 6 pm, along\nwith PW-23 and his driver. According to PW-23, they had made a plan to\nvisit the Sai Baba Temple at Lodhi Road and left in the deceased‟s Maruti\ncar bearing number 0804, which was a Maruti-800, silver colour, and was\ndriven by the driver of the deceased. The driver was dropped off at the\nIncome Tax Office Circle. Thereafter, the deceased started driving the car.\nHe dropped PW-23 at Sai Baba Mandir in Lodhi Road. The deceased\napparently told PW-23 that he was unable to come to the temple as he had to\ngo to Deepak Sarna (A-3) to collect a payment of around Rs.80-90,000/-.\n\n6. The deceased, who would normally reach back home by 9.30 pm, did not\nreturn home that night. When PW-1 tried calling the deceased on his mobile\nphone (ending in 6347), he was unable to get through. PW-1 continued\ntrying to contact the deceased on his mobile phone till 4 am on 29 th October,\n2000. A number of friends and relatives were also contacted and plenty of\nthem reached the residence of PW-1 by about 5 am. Various hospitals were\nalso searched, but the deceased could not be located.\n\n7. According to PW-1, after 8.30 am, they went to the shop of A-3 in\nMalviya Nagar. This was on account of the fact that PW-23 had informed\nPW-1 about the deceased telling him that he was going to A-3 to collect the\nmoney owed to him. According to PW-1, they asked the servants at the shop\nof A-3 whether the deceased had come there on 28th October, 2000. They\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 3 of 40\n\n answered in the affirmative. Ashutosh (PW-6), a cousin of PW-1, then tried\nto speak to A-3 on the phone, but he could not be contacted. A message was\nleft with the servants that as and when A-3 came to the shop, he should\ncontact PW-1. The mobile phone number of PW-6 was also left behind with\nthe servants, to be passed on to A-3.\n\n8. At around 10.30 or 11 am, when A-3 came to the shop, he contacted PW-\n6 and informed him that the deceased had come to him at around 6.30 or 7\npm on 28th October, 2000.He further stated that the deceased had received a\ncall on his mobile phone and had then left at around 8.30 pm. Thereafter,\nsince they had failed to trace the whereabouts of the deceased and thought\nthat A-3 was the last person who had been seen with the deceased, PW-6\ntook A-3 to the PS to get the missing report lodged.\n\n9. On the evening of 29th October, 2000, PW-1 along with friends and\nrelatives again went to the house of A-3 at around 11 pm. PW-1 has stated\nthat he had known A-3 and his family for the last 28 years. A-3 again stated\nwhat he had told PW-6 the previous day, only this time he stated that the\ndeceased had left at around 10 or 10.30 pm.\n\n10. According to PW-1, the deceased had told him that he had given A-3\nRs.80,000/- to Rs.90,000/- from his personal savings. PW-1 later learnt that\nthe deceased had in fact given A-3 Rs.4 to 5 lacs. According to PW-1, the\ndeceased had also told him that A-3 was trying to avoid the deceased\nwhenever he had demanded repayment of the money and, therefore, the\nrelations between him and the deceased had become strained.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 4 of 40\n\n 11. According to PW-1, the deceased was wearing a gold kada, gold chain\nand diamond ring when he was last seen on 28th October, 2000. He also had\na mobile phone of Nokia make and a purse containing money and credit\ncard. A suit and a new shirt were also in the car of the deceased. The bunch\nof keys with the deceased included not only the keys for the office but also\nthe home.\n\nComplaint to the police\n\n12. On 29th October 2000 PW-6 gave a complaint at PS Malviya Nagar\nwhich was recorded as DD No.9-A (Ex. PW-6/1) to the effect that the\ndeceased had gone missing after visiting the shop of A-3 at around 9.30 pm.\nThe mobile number of the deceased was indicated in this complaint. It was\nstated that there was no suspicion against anyone. This complaint was\nentrusted to Sub Inspector („SI‟) Gurdev Singh (PW-25). According to PW-\n25, when he first made inquiries from the family of the deceased, they\ninformed him that they had no suspicion on anyone about the kidnapping of\nthe deceased.\n\n13. On 30th October, 2000, PW-1 himself lodged a report with the PS. This\ntime, after analyzing the statements given by A-3, PW-1 felt that he was\ninvolved in the matter and as a result, he named A-3 as the last person in\nwhose company the deceased was seen. The report is Ex.PW-1/1.\n\n14. Subsequently, after making inquiries, which were unsuccessful, PW-25\ncame back to the PS. He received a copy of the FIR (Ex. PW-20/A) which\nwas lodged by PW-1, raising the suspicion against A-3 stating that A-3 had\ngiven the deceased a call immediately before his having gone missing. On\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 5 of 40\n\n 31st October, 2000, the relatives of the deceased, including PW-6, Paramjit\nSingh (PW-5), Subodh (not examined) and some other relatives went to the\nPS and met PW-25. All of them along with a Constable reached the shop of\nA-3 at Malviya Nagar. The relatives of the deceased identified A-3. Upon\nhis interrogation, A-3 is supposed to have made a disclosure statement (Ex.\nPW-2/1) in the presence of Constables Narender (not examined), Gurwir\n(not examined) and Ashok (PW-2). A-3 was arrested and his personal search\nconducted.\n\nRecovery of the body\n\n15. According to PW-25, pursuant to the disclosure statement made by A-3,\nPW-25 proceeded to village Simbhavali, UP. The Station House Officer\n(„SHO‟) of PS Malviya Nagar also started for the village in a separate\nvehicle, followed by relatives of the deceased. They reached village\nSimbhavali at 3.15 pm on 31st October, 2000. A-3 is supposed to have\npointed out a well situated there and informed them that the dead body of\nthe deceased had been thrown in the said well. PW-25 noticed that there\nwere bloodstains on the boundary wall of the well which were faint and\nillegible. A-3 is further supposed to have disclosed that the clothes on the\ndead body were removed by A-3 and the other accused and there was only\nunderwear on the body when it was thrown into the well. Some villagers\nwith the help of rope and a bucket enabled PW-25 to see a portion of the\nbody, as it initially was not visible from ground level.\n\n16. PW-25 along with the SHO went to PS Simbhavali and joined SI Hukam\nSingh (PW-12) along with Constable Ranbir (PW-11) and Constable Paras.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 6 of 40\n\n They again reached the well and this time, with the help of the villagers,\nmanaged to take the body out. All the relatives of the deceased identified the\nbody, which was thereafter sent to the hospital for post-mortem.\n\n17. According to PW-25, in his disclosure statement A-3 informed about the\ninvolvement of other two co-accused persons and the police started looking\nfor A-1 and A-2. They also sought to trace two other persons, namely, Arun\nand Bunty, who were supposed to have been with A-1 to A-3 in the\ncommission of the crime. However, they were not traceable.\n\n18. PW-25 then went to the place of the incident in Noida, during which\ntime, A-3 was with him. According to him, A-3 pointed out the place of the\nincident and PW-25 prepared a site plan (Ex. PW-25/B). PW-25 states that\nA-3 disclosed that they had thrown the knife somewhere there but this could\nnot be traced.\n\n19. On 1st November, 2000, the Appellant was produced before the learned\nMetropolitan Magistrate („MM‟). Thereafter, A-3 was taken to PS Hauz\nKhas and placed in a police lockup at 8.30 pm.\n\nRecovery of the car\n\n20. On the morning of 4th November, 2000 PW-25 along with Constables\nNarender (not examined), Gurwir (not examined) and Ashok Kumar (PW-2)\nalong with ASI Radhey Shyam (PW-16) went to recover the car belonging\nto the deceased. A-3 is said to have led them to a place in village Dehat,\nUttar Pradesh. However, they could not find the car there. They went to PS\nDehat, Kotwali District Ghaziabad where the local police informed them\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 7 of 40\n\n that the car had been seized by them as abandoned on 31st October, 2000 and\nhas been deposited in the said PS. PW-25 then seized the car vide seizure\nmemo Ex.PW-25/C. From there he proceeded to collect the post mortem\nreport and thereafter went to the well where the body was found and\nprepared a site plan of the well Ex.PW-25/B. He recorded the statements of\nMange Ram (PW-9) and Rajpal (PW-10) in respect of recovery of the dead\nbody on 4th November, 2000. The car seized was deposited in the Malkhana\nat PS Malviya Nagar. The car of A-3 was also seized on 8th November,\n2000 vide seizure memo (Ex.PW-25).\n\nPost mortem\n\n21. The post-mortem was performed by Dr. Ajay Aggarwal (PW-19) at\naround 11.40 am on 1st November 2000. He found the following ante-\nmortem injuries on the body:-\n\n \"The following ante-mortem injuries were found on the body:\n\n (1) there was incised wound of 4 cm. X 2 cm on right side chest\n at the level of 10th rib in mid auxiliary line.\n\n (2) Incised wound of the size 3 cm x 1 cm on right cheek.\n\n (3) There was ligature mark of the size 34 X 2 cm around the\n neck.\n\n On internal examination, brain and lungs were found congested.\n On abdominal examination, it was found full of blood, stomach\n was found empty and lever as well as small intestine were\n lacerated.\"\n\n22. The cause of death was stated to be ante-mortem injuries at serial\nnumbers 1 to 3, which were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 8 of 40\n\n cause death. The time since death was given as 3 days.\n\n23. In his cross-examination, PW-19 admitted that he found two incised\nwounds on the body of the deceased. The ligature mark was visible with\nnaked eye.\n\nChange of IOs\n\n24. PW-25 stated that on 9th November, 2000, he sustained injuries as a\nresult of stone pelting at Kalkaji. The case was then transferred to SI Neeraj\n(PW-26). In his examination-in-chief, PW-25 stated that he joined the\ninvestigation of the case on 30th October 2000 and on that day itself, it\ntranspired that Bal Mohan @ Vicky (PW-7) informed him that he along with\nthe deceased had consumed liquor at the shop of A-3.\n\n25. In his cross-examination, PW-25 admitted that the investigation\nremained with him till 8th November, 2000. On 5th November, 2000, PW-25\nrecorded the statements of certain public witnesses i.e. Paramjit Singh (PW-\n\n5), Ashutosh Roy (PW-6) and Alok Srivastava under \nSection 161\n Cr PC.\nPW-25 after seeing the statements of PWs Paramjit Singh, Ashutosh and\nAlok Srivastava stated that these three witnesses had told the police in their\nstatements under \nSection 161\n Cr PC that A-3 had disclosed in front of them\nthat the pant containing the keys of the deceased was also thrown in the\nwell. However, after analyzing the statements under \nSection 161\n, it was\nfound that while PW-5 had mentioned that the pant containing keys was\nthrown in the well, PW-6 and Alok Srivastava mentioned only the throwing\nof pants in the well but made no mention of the keys. It appears that no logs\nwere maintained in the form of DD entries for the departure of the police\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 9 of 40\n\n from the PS or even the corresponding entries at PS Simbhavali.\n\n26. According to PW-25 on 9th November, 2000 he was injured and\ntherefore the investigation of this case was transferred to Inspector Neeraj\nKumar (PW-26).\n\nArrest of A-1 and A-2\n\n27. How A-1 and A-2 were arrested in the present case is not clear. What is\nspoken of both by Head Constable Jasbir Singh (PW-3) and Constable Hari\nBabu (PW-14), both of whom were posted at Police Post, Pushp Vihar\nattached to PS Malviya Nagar, was that both A-1 & A-2 were arrested and\nwere taken to PS Malviya Nagar where they made separate disclosure\nstatements (Ex.PW-3/1) and (Ex.PW-3/2) respectively. Their personal\nsearch was undertaken and arrest memos (Ex.PW14/A) and (Ex.PW-14/B)\nrespectively were prepared.\n\n28. On 13th November, 2000 supplementary disclosure statements were\nmade by them. Even PW-26 has stated that upon taking over the\ninvestigation on 9th November 2000, he found the co-accused A-1 and A-2\n\"sitting in the room of DO, PD Malviya Nagar and I met them\". He had then\nproceeded to arrest the two co-accused and record their disclosure\nstatements which have been referred to above. A-1 and A-2 too took the\npolice to the same well and pointing out memos were prepared. They\nclaimed to have thrown the body after removing the pant and a bunch of\nkeys into the well. According to PW-26, he asked Constable Dharamvir\n(PW-24) to climb down into the well and a bunch of keys containing 8 keys\nand a jeans pant of blue colour stained with mud and blood was recovered.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 10 of 40\n\n These were sealed vide seizure memo (Ex.PW-3/9). According to PW-26, he\ngot both A-1 and A-2 medically examined on 14th November, 2000.\n\nFiling of charge sheet\n\n29. On 23rd November, 2000 PW-26 was transferred from PS Malviya\nNagar. He handed over the case file to SI Raj Shekhar (PW-21) for further\ninvestigation.\n\n30. Not much happened with PW-21 as he too was transferred from PS\nMalviya Nagar in the month of January, 2001. It appears that ultimately, on\n13th January 2001, the investigation was handed over to SI Ramesh Kaushik\n(PW-27). He got the supplementary statement of PW-1 recorded and got\n\"the bunch of keys and two pants subjected to Test Identification Parade\n(„TIP‟).\" He filed the charge sheet against the three accused as well as the\nsupplementary challan against the two absconding accused Bunti and Arun.\nHe also collected the report of the Forensic Sciences Laboratory („FSL‟)\n(Ex.PW-27/A).\n\nTrial\n\n31. Charges were framed against the three accused by the trial Court on 3 rd\nMay, 2001 in the manner indicated hereinbefore. They pleaded not guilty\nand claimed trial.\n\n32. On behalf of the prosecution, 29 witnesses were examined. As far as the\nstatements under \nSection 313\n Cr.PC are concerned, since A-1 and A-2 have\nbeen acquitted, it is necessary to notice the answers given by A-3 alone, who\nwas convicted by the trial Court.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 11 of 40\n\n 33. The Appellant (A-3) denied the incriminating circumstances put to him.\nIn response to the suggestions in questions 18 and 22 that he was a friend of\nthe deceased, he answered that the deceased was known to him but he was\nnot his friend. A-3 denied having gone to the spot where the body was\nrecovered. As regards recovery of the car, A-3 stated that its possession was\nhanded over to the police by his father as per their instructions. He denied\nmaking any disclosure statements and claimed that his signatures/initials\nwere forcibly obtained on blank papers by the police. A-3 denied having\nbeen associated with the recovery of the deceased's car from the PS Kotwali,\nDehat, Ghaziabad. He denied having been taken there and brought back at\nPS Malviya Nagar. A-3 claimed that he had been falsely implicated. No\ndefence evidence was led.\n\nImpugned judgment of the trial Court\n\n34. The trial court has in the impugned judgment listed out the following\ncircumstances as forming a complete chain which unmistakeably pointed to\nthe guilt of the present Appellant:\n\n \"1. Recovery of articles.\n\n 1(a) Recovery of dead body on 31.10.2000.\n\n 1(b) Recovery of bunch of keys and jeans pant of the\n deceased on 13.11.2000.\n\n 2. Recovery of car of the deceased.\n\n 3. Motive\n\n 4. Last seen/meeting evidence.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 12 of 40\n\n 5. Defence.\n\n 6. Role of the IO/Investigating officer.\"\n\n(ii) As regards the recovery of the body from the well, the trial Court\n noticed that PWs 4, 9 & 10 had all turned hostile. Even Constable\n Ashok Kumar (PW-2) claimed to have got the dead body recovered\n on 1st November, 2000 and not 31st October, 2000 as claimed by the\n prosecution. However, PWs 5, 6, 11, 12 and 25 were held by the trial\n Court to have supported the story of the prosecution. According to the\n trial Court, there was not even the „slightest scintilla of evidence‟\n which would show that the above witnesses harboured hostility\n against the accused and there was no reason why they should not be\n believed. As regards the U.P police officials, the trial Court declared\n that „it had implicit faith in their evidence‟. It was accordingly\n concluded that the fact of recovery of the dead body at the instance of\n A-3 stood established beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n(iii) In the same breath, the trial Court found that the investigation by PW-\n\n 25 was unsatisfactory. The recovery of the bunch of keys and jeans\n pants on 13th November, 2000 at the instance of A-1 & A-2 was\n disbelieved by the trial Court and they were held entitled to the\n benefit of doubt.\n\n(iv) According to the trial Court, the recovery of the car in the vicinity of\n the recovery of the dead body „further goes to invigorate the\n circumstantial evidence.‟ There was no further discussion on this\n circumstance.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 13 of 40\n\n (v) As regards the motive, the trial Court referred to the evidence of PW-\n\n 1, which was supported by the evidence of PW-23 and it was held that\n although the fact that the deceased had paid A-3 a sum of Rs. 4 to 5\n lacs appeared to be „an afterthought‟, it stood proved that A-3 owed\n the deceased Rs.80,000 to 90,000/- and this provided the motive for\n the crime.\n\n35. The trial Court next discussed the circumstance of last seen. It was held\nthat the version of PW-1 stood corroborated by the versions of PW 5 & 6. It\nwas proved that the deceased had stayed with A-3 till 9.30 p.m. on 28th\nOctober, 2000. The simple denial by A-3 in his defence was to no avail.\nAlthough the trial Court noted that there were major flaws in the\ninvestigation and the murder weapon could not be recovered and no copy of\nthe FIR was sent to the MM or higher authorities, there were no chances the\nrecord being manipulated in favour of the prosecution. For the\naforementioned reasons, the trial Court held the case against the Appellant\nto have been proved beyond reasonable doubt and proceeded to convict and\nsentence him in the manner indicated hereinbefore.\n\n36. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. Pramod Kumar Dubey,\nlearned counsel for the Appellant and Mr. Kewal Singh Ahuja, the learned\nAPP for the State.\n\nLaw relating to circumstantial evidence\n\n37. This is a case based on circumstantial evidence and the law in this regard\nis fairly well settled. The following observations made by the Supreme\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 14 of 40\n\n Court in \nSattatiya v. State of Maharashtra\n (2008) 3 SCC 210:\n\n \"10. We have thoughtfully considered the entire matter. It is\n settled law that an offence can be proved not only by direct\n evidence but also by circumstantial evidence where there is no\n direct evidence. The Court can draw an inference of guilt when\n all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be\n totally incompatible with the innocence of the accused. Of\n course, the circumstances from which an inference as to the\n guilt is drawn have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and\n have to be shown to be closely connected with the principal fact\n sought to be inferred from those circumstances...\n\n \n... 17. At this stage, we also deem it proper to observe that in\n exercise of power under \nArticle 136\n of the Constitution, this\n Court will be extremely loath to upset the judgment of\n conviction which is confirmed in appeal. However, if it is found\n that the appreciation of evidence in a case, which is entirely\n based on circumstantial evidence, is vitiated by serious errors\n and on that account miscarriage of justice has been occasioned,\n then the Court will certainly interfere even with the concurrent\n findings recorded by the trial court and the High Court \nBharat\n v. State of M.P.\n (2003) 3 SCC 106. In the light of the above, we\n shall now consider whether in the present case the prosecution\n succeeded in establishing the chain of circumstances leading to\n an inescapable conclusion that the appellant had committed the\n crime.\"\n\n38. \nIn \nG. Parshwanath v. State of Karnataka\n (2010) 8 SCC 593, the\nSupreme Court made the following observations when considering a case\nhinging on circumstantial evidence:\n\n \"23. In cases where evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the\n circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn\n should, in the first instance, be fully established. Each fact\n sought to be relied upon must be proved individually. However,\n in applying this principle a distinction must be made between\n facts called primary or basic on the one hand and inference of\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 15 of 40\n\n facts to be drawn from them on the other. In regard to proof of\n primary facts, the court has to judge the evidence and decide\n whether that evidence proves a particular fact and if that fact is\n proved, the question whether that fact leads to an inference of\n guilt of the accused person should be considered. In dealing\n with this aspect of the problem, the doctrine of benefit of doubt\n applies. Although there should not be any missing links in the\n case, yet it is not essential that each of the links must appear on\n the surface of the evidence adduced and some of these links\n may have to be inferred from the proved facts. In drawing these\n inferences, the court must have regard to the common course of\n natural events and to human conduct and their relations to the\n facts of the particular case. The Court thereafter has to consider\n the effect of proved facts. In deciding the sufficiency of the\n circumstantial evidence for the purpose of conviction, the court\n has to consider the total cumulative effect of all the proved\n facts, each one of which reinforces the conclusion of guilt and\n if the combined effect of all these facts taken together is\n conclusive in establishing the guilt of the accused, the\n conviction would be justified even though it may be that one or\n more of these facts by itself or themselves is/are not decisive.\n The facts established should be consistent only with the\n hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and should exclude every\n hypothesis except the one sought to be proved. But this does\n not mean that before the prosecution can succeed in a case\n resting upon circumstantial evidence alone, it must exclude\n each and every hypothesis suggested by the accused,\n howsoever, extravagant and fanciful it might be. There must be\n a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable\n ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the\n accused and must show that in all human probability the act\n must have been done by the accused, where various links in\n chain are in themselves complete, then the false plea or false\n defence may be called into aid only to lend assurance to the\n court.\"\n\n39. The legal position was summarised in \nPadala Veera Reddy v. State of\nAndhra Pradesh\n 1989 Supp (2) SCC 706, as under:\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 16 of 40\n\n (a) The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be\n drawn must be cogently and firmly established;\n\n(b) Those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly\n pointing towards guilt of the accused;\n\n(c) The circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain so\n complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all\n human probability, the crime was committed by the accused and none\n else; and\n\n(d) The circumstantial evidence, in order to sustain conviction, must be\n complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than\n that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be\n consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent\n with his innocence.\n\nLast seen\n\n40. The Court would first like to discuss the evidence of last seen. The\nprosecution has relied on PWs 1,5,6,7, 8 and 23 as being relevant for this\ncircumstance. Of these, as rightly pointed out by learned counsel for the\nAppellant, only PWs 7 and 8 have actually spoken about the deceased being\nlast seen in the company of A-3. Since both PWs 7 and 8 turned hostile, it is\nthe other witnesses viz., i.e. PWs 1, 5,6 and 23 whose evidence will require\nto be carefully examined in regard to the evidence of last seen.\n\n41. First, turning to the evidence of PW-1, he left the office before the\ndeceased did and had no occasion to know if on the fateful day i.e. 28 th\nOctober 2000, the deceased left to meet A-3. In his complaint to the police\nmade on 30th October 2000 (Ex. PW-1/1), PW-1 stated that PW-23 told him\nthat while dropping off PW-23 at the Sai Baba Mandir on Lodhi Road, the\ndeceased told PW-23 that he was going to South Delhi to \"meet his friend.\"\nPW-1 did not name A-3 as that friend. He then stated in his complaint:\n\n \"We understand through our contact that Manish visited Mr. Deepak\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 17 of 40\n\n Sarna at 8-L 81 B Lower G Floor at ---Malviya Nagar, N. Delhi.\n Upon contacting Mr. Deepak Sarna, he confirmed that Manish was\n with him from 7.30 pm till 10.15 pm at his automobile accessory at\n the above said address. He was last seen and was with Mr. Deepak\n Sarna after that there is no trace of him.\"\n\n42. But at that stage PW-1 did not suspect A-3. He merely stated in his\ncomplaint that: \"It seems my son Mr. Manish Chowdhry has been detained\nby someone to cause harm to him.\"\n\n43. The next time PW-1 spoke to the police was when his statement under\n\nSection 161\n Cr PC (Ex PW-1/DA) was recorded. Although this statement is\nundated, since it is signed by SI Neeraj Kumar (PW-26) who took over the\ninvestigation from PW-25 on 9th November 2000, it is safe to presume that\nthis statement was recorded only thereafter. In this statement PW-1 stated\nthat Vicky (PW-7) a friend of the deceased informed PW-1 on the phone\nthat the deceased was with A-3 that evening. However, with PW-7 turning\nhostile, this part of the statement of PW-1 was not corroborated.\n\n44. In Court, PW-1 deposed about his having gone along with Ashutosh\n(PW-6) to the shop of A-3 on 29th October 2000; how they first found his\nservants who told them that the deceased had come there; that on coming to\nknow of the above fact PW-6 tried to contact A-3 on the phone; that PW-1\nhimself was nervous and perplexed at that time; that A-3 could not be\ncontacted on phone by PW-6 which persuaded them to leave a message with\nthe servants that as and when A-3 came to the shop he should contact them;\nthat PW-6 left his mobile number with the servants; that at around 10.30 or\n11.00 am, when A-3 returned to shop he contacted PW-6 on his mobile\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 18 of 40\n\n phone informing him that the deceased had come to him and remained with\nhim till 8.30 pm; that A-3 told PW-6 that the deceased had received a call on\nhis mobile phone and left A-3 at 8.30 pm. In the cross-examination of PW-1\nit was able to be elicited by counsel for the defence that all of the above\nstatements were improvements. In other words none of the above details\nwere given either in the initial complaint (Ex. PW-1/D1) or in the statement\nunder \nSection 161\n Cr PC (Ex. PW-1/DA).\n\n45. While the above improvements could be viewed as affecting the\ncredibility of PW-1, the fact remains that both in the first complaint given as\nDD No.9A on 29th October 2000 and in the FIR lodged by PW-1 on 30th\nOctober 2000 (PW-1/1) it was mentioned that the deceased had gone to the\nshop of A-3 in the evening of 28th October 2000.\n\n46. Turning now to the evidence of Paramjeet Singh (PW-5), an\nacquaintance of PW-1, his statement under \nSection 161\n Cr PC was recorded\nby SI Gurdev Singh (PW-25) only on 5th November 2000, although PW-25\nis supposed to have taken over the investigation on 30th October 2000. There\nis no explanation for the delay. In Court, PW-5 deposed about his having\ngone to the shop of A-3 on 29th October 2000 with PW-1 and PW-6 and A-3\nhaving told them that the deceased had come there in his car and left around\n7 or 7.30 pm and later stating that the deceased left at around 10 pm, and\nthis leading them to suspect A-3. This statement of his was unable to be\ndiscredited in his cross-examination. His further statement that for the\nsecond time on 31st October 2000 in the presence of the police, A-3 admitted\nto the deceased visiting his shop is consistent with what he stated in his\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 19 of 40\n\n previous statement to the police. On this part too no contradiction could be\nelicited from PW-5 in his cross-examination.\n\n47. We then have the evidence of Ashutosh (PW-6) who joined PW-1 in\nsearching for the deceased from 28th October 2000 evening itself. Even his\ninitial statement under \nSection 161\n Cr PC was recorded by PW-25 only on\n5th November 2000. However, it will be recalled that he gave a complaint on\n29th October 2000 itself (DD No.9A) in which he stated that the deceased\nwas last seen visiting A-3 in his shop at around 9.30 pm. While deposing in\nCourt, PW-6 spoke of A-3 admitting to them on 29th October 2000 when\nthey met him, that the deceased had visited his shop in the evening of 28 th\nOctober 2000. PW-6 also deposed about the second time on 31 st October\n2000 when A-3, in the presence of the police admitted to the deceased\ncoming to his shop and about his having committed a blunder. In his cross-\nexamination, no contradiction could be elicited from PW-6 about the\nadmission made by A-3 to him on 29th October 2000. In fact in his cross\nexamination PW-6 stated: \"It is correct that the missing report (DD 9A) has\nbeen lodged by me after having a talk with accd. Deepak.\" Therefore, both\nPWs 5 and 6 have supported the case of the prosecution that the deceased\nvisited the shop of A-3 in the evening of 28th October 2000 and remained\nthere till around 10 pm.\n\n48. Turning now to Raj Gupta (PW-23), it will be recalled that in the\ncomplaint given by PW-1 to the police (Ex PW-1/1) PW-1 mentions\nspecifically that PW-23 was dropped off by the deceased at the Sai Baba\nmandir on Lodhi Road and that the deceased told him that he was visiting a\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 20 of 40\n\n friend. On this material aspect of the deceased dropping him off and then\nproceeding to South Delhi to visit A-3 no contradiction could be elicited\nfrom PW-23 in his cross examination. But then again the statement of PW-\n23 under \nSection 161\n Cr PC was recorded only on or after 9 th November\n2000 by PW-26 after he took over the investigation.\n\n49. The picture that emerges from the above discussion is that PWs 1, 5 and\n6 are consistent that when he was met by them on 29th October 2000, A-3\nadmitted that the deceased had visited him on 28 th October 2000 in the\nevening and was there till around 10 pm. However, this by itself will not\nmake this an incriminating circumstance vis-a vis A-3, since the time and\nplace of discovery of the dead body was not proximate to this event. It will\nbe recalled that the post mortem report placed the time of death at 3 days\nprior thereto which takes it to the morning of 29th October 2000 and not the\nnight of 28th October 2000.\n\n50. The fact that the dead body was found three days later on 31 st October\n2000 and in a well in village Simbhavali in U.P. at a considerable distance\nfrom Malviya Nagar makes this circumstance of last seen a rather weak\npiece of evidence qua A-3. The legal position in this regard has been\nexplained by the Supreme Court in \nState of U.P. v. Satish\n (2005) 3 SCC\n114, as under:\n\n \"The last seen theory comes into play where the time-gap\n between the point of time when the accused and the deceased\n were seen last alive and when the deceased is found dead is so\n small that possibility of any person other than the accused being\n the author of the crime becomes impossible. It would be\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 21 of 40\n\n difficult in some cases to positively establish that the deceased\n was last seen with the accused when there is a long gap and\n possibility of other persons coming in between exists. In the\n absence of any other positive evidence to conclude that the\n accused and the deceased were last seen together, it would be\n hazardous to come to a conclusion of guilt in those cases.‟\n\n51. \nIn \nState of Karnataka v. Chand Basha\n (2015) 3 ACR 3439, the\nSupreme Court explained:\n\n \"This Court has time and again laid down the ingredients to be\n made out by the prosecution to prove the „last seen together‟\n theory. The Court for the purpose of arriving at a finding as to\n whether the said offence has been committed or not, may take\n into consideration the circumstantial evidence. However, while\n doing so, it must be borne in mind that close proximity between\n the last seen evidence and death should be clearly established.\"\n\nDelay in recording the statements of witnesses\n\n52. In the present case, the statements of most of the PWs under \nSection 161\n\nCr PC were recorded on 5th November 2000 or thereafter, i.e. more than\nseven days after the deceased went missing and at least five days after the\narrest of A-3 on 31st October 2000 and his purported disclosure soon\nthereafter. The first IO, PW-25, was in charge of the investigation from 30 th\nOctober till 9th November 2000. Therefore, the change of IO was also not an\nexcuse for not immediately recording the statement of the key witnesses i.e.\nPWs 1, 5, 6 and 23. No convincing explanation has been offered by the\nprosecution for this delay.\n\n53. \nIn \nHarbeer Singh v. Sheeshpal\n (2016)16 SCC 418, the Supreme Court\nexplained the law in relation to the delay in recording the statements of\nwitnesses and the apparent effect of material improvements made by a\nwitness while deposing in the Court. It was observed:\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 22 of 40\n\n \n\"The Explanation to \nSection 162\n Code of Criminal Procedure\n provides that an omission to state a fact of circumstance in the\n statement recorded by a police officer under \nSection 161\n Code\n of Criminal Procedure, may amount to contradiction if the same\n appears to be significant, and otherwise relevant having regard\n to the context in which such omission occurs and whether any\n omission amounts to a contradiction in the particular context\n shall be a question of fact. Thus, while it is true that every\n improvement is not fatal to the prosecution case, in cases where\n an improvement creates a serious doubt about the truthfulness\n or credibility of a witness, the defence may take advantage of\n the same. [See \nAshok Vishnu Davare v. State of Maharashtra\n\n (2004) 9 SCC 431; \nRadha Kumar v. State of Bihar\n (now\n Jharkhand) (2005) 10 SCC 216; \nSunil Kumar Sambhudayal\n Gupta (Dr.) v. State of Maharashtra\n (2010) 13 SCC 657 and\n Baldev Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 12 SCC 473]. In our\n view, the High Court had rightly considered these omissions as\n material omissions amounting to contradictions covered by the\n Explanation to \nSection 162\n Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n Moreover, it has also come in evidence that there was a delay of\n 15-16 days from the date of the incident in recording the\n statements of PW3 and PW9 and the same was sought to be\n unconvincingly explained by reference to the fact that the\n family had to sit for shock meetings for 12 to 13 days. Needless\n to say, we are not impressed by this explanation and feel that\n the High Court was right in entertaining doubt in this regard.\n\n As regards the incident of murder of the deceased, the\n prosecution has produced six eye-witnesses to the same. The\n argument raised against the reliance upon the testimony of these\n witnesses pertains to the delay in the recording of their\n statements by the police under \nSection 161\n of Code of Criminal\n Procedure. In the present case, the date of occurrence was\n 21.12.1993 but the statements of PW 1and PW5 were recorded\n after two days of incident, i.e., on 23.12.1993. The evidence of\n PW6 was recorded on 26.12.1993 while the evidence of PW 11\n was recorded after 10 days of incident, i.e., on 31.12.1993.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 23 of 40\n\n \nFurther, it is well-settled law that delay in recording the\n statement of the witnesses does not necessarily discredit their\n testimony. The Court may rely on such testimony if they are\n cogent and credible and the delay is explained to the\n satisfaction of the Court. [See \nGaneshlal v. State of\n Maharashtra\n (1992) 3 SCC 106; \nMohd. Khalid v. State of W.B.\n\n (2002) 7 SCC 334; \nPrithvi (Minor) v. Mam Raj\n (\n2004) 13 SCC\n 279 and Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of\n Delhi\n) (2010) 6 SCC 1].\"\n\n54. While the evidence of all of the above witnesses do not have to be\nrejected in entirety on account of the above lapse, the possible references\nmade by some of them to certain crucial incriminating aspects may require\nto be rejected on account of this delay, particularly since by 5 th November\n2000, the purported disclosure statement of A-3 was already available with\nthe IO. For example both PWs 5 and 6, in their statements under \nSection 161\n\nrecorded on 5th November 2000, advert to A-3 stating on 31st October 2000\nin the presence of the police to making a mistake. If their statements had\nbeen recorded contemporaneously with the recording of the disclosure of A-\n3 such statements would have been credible. Likewise, in his statement\nunder \nSection 161\n Cr PC recorded six days after the arrest of A-3, PW-23\ndiscloses about the deceased telling him that A-3 owed him Rs. 80 to\n90,000. Considering that this was supposed to provide the motive for the\noffence, the fact that neither PW-6 in his initial complaint (DD No.9A) nor\nPW-1 in his first complaint (Ex PW-1/1) makes any mention of this, makes\nthe evidence of PWs 5 and 6 on this aspect unreliable.\n\nRecoveries not proved\n\n55. Coming to the recovery of the dead body of the deceased on 31 st\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 24 of 40\n\n October, 2000 a large number of witnesses are said to have spoken about the\ncircumstance. As already noted by the trial Court three of the witnesses i.e.\nBaljeet (PW-4), Mange Ram (PW-9) and Raj Pal Singh (PW-10) turned\nhostile.\n\n56. According to the prosecution, the disclosure was made by A-3 on 31st\nOctober, 2000 and the recovery was purportedly made on the same date i.e.\n31st October, 2000 as can be seen from the pointing out memo (Ex. PW-2/4).\nIncidentally this has been attested by Constable Narendra, Constable Gurwir\nSingh and Constable Ashok Kumar (PW-2). The only one who was\nexamined among these three was PW-2. Far from supporting the\nprosecution, he actually made a mess of it as already noticed by the trial\nCourt. He gave a completely different version of the recovery having been\neffected on 1st November, 2000. There appears to be confusion as regards\nthe precise date of the recovery which is evident from the following reply\ngiven by him:\n\n \"On 31st October 2000 I had not gone in searching the four\n persons, who, according to Deepak, were also involved in the\n murder. I do not know as to whether SI Gurdev Singh had gone\n in search of those four persons or not, on 31.10.2000. (Ld.\n counsel for the accused submits that he has not been supplied\n any statement of this witness recorded on 31st October 2000.\n He submits that if there is any statement dated 31st October\n 2000 of this witness and of constable Narender and Constable\n Gurvir Singh, the same be supplied. Ld. A.P.P. submits that as\n per the case diary statements of these three constables were\n recorded on 1st November 2000 and there is no statement dated\n 31st October 2000 of any of these three constables).\"\n\n57. Turning next to the evidence of SI Hukum Singh (PW-12), he admitted\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 25 of 40\n\n in his cross-examination that his statement was recorded by PW-25 only on\n4th November, 2000. He further admitted as under:\n\n \"I had not obtained sign. or thumb impression of accused\n Deepak Sarna in either daily diary or Panchnama Ex.PW5/1 to\n establish the presence of accused Deepak Sarna. I had not\n recorded any statement of accused Deepak Sarna to establish\n his presence at Village Simbhavali.\"\n\n58. It is doubtful whether he was at all present at the time of the recovery of\nthe dead body. In his cross-examination he stated:\n\n \"I had further stated that accused Deepak Sarna led us to the\n well and pointed out to the same stating the above facts\n confronted with statement Ex.PW 12/DA where the said facts\n are not recorded specifically. Vol. I had mentioned this fact in\n my panchayatnama Ex.PW5/1.\"\n\n59. Likewise Constable Raghubir Singh (PW-11) also admitted that his\nstatement was recorded only on 4th November, 2000 i.e. long after the\nrecovery was already affected and not simultaneously along with the\nrecovery. He too made numerous improvements as is evident from the\nfollowing replies:\n\n \"I had stated in my statement under \nsection 161\n Cr.PC that\n accused Deepak Sarna was brought by Delhi police at PS\n Simbhavali. (confronted with statement Ex.PW11/DA where it\n is not mentioned that accd. Deepak Sarna was brought to PS\n Simbhavali.)\n\n I had also stated in my statement that the accd. Deepak Sarna\n led us to the well and told in my presence that he after killing\n deceased Manish had thrown the dead body in the said well.\n (confronted with Ex. PW11/DA where this fact is not recorded).\n\n I do not remember whether I stated in my statement\n u/s 161\n\n Cr.P.C. that accd. Deepak Sarna was present when the dead\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 26 of 40\n\n body was lifted out the well. The said fact is not mentioned in\n Ex. PW11/DA.\"\n\n60. The suggestion to PW-11, which he denied, was that the local villagers\nhad already taken out the dead body from the well and this information was\nalready available with the police of PS Simbhavali even before the Delhi\nPolice could reach there. The prosecution has not been able to explain why\nthe statements of PWs 11 and 12 under \nSection 161\n Cr PC were not\nrecorded on 31st October 2000 itself but only on 4th November 2000. They\nwere also not witnesses to the recovery memo.\n\n61. Two other PWs who are supposed to have gone with the police for the\nrecovery of the dead body were PWs 5 and 6. Yet, neither of them were\nwitnesses to any of the recovery memos drawn up in that regard.\n\n62. As far as Paramjeet Singh (PW-5) was concerned, his statement to the\npolice (Ex.PW-5/DA) was recorded only on 5th November, 2000, long after\nthe recovery of the dead body had already been affected. He too turned out\nto be an unreliable witness as is evident from the answers pursuant to which\nhe was confronted in the Court with his previous statement:\n\n \"I had told the police official that from the shop we had gone\n to the P.S. (confronted with Ex.PW5/DA where it is not so\n recorded). I had told the police that from the P.S. Deepak\n Sarna and police officials had gone to village Simbhavali\n (Confronted with Ex.PW5/DA where it is not so recorded).\n (The statement Ex.PW5/DA shall be read at the time of final\n arguments to appreciate this particular fact). I had told the\n police officials that accd. Deepak Sarna had pointed out the\n well in village Simbhavali and told that the dead body was in\n that well. (Confronted with Ex.PW5/DA where it is not, so\n recorded).\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 27 of 40\n\n I had told the police that I had also seen the dead body\n floating in the well (Confronted with Ex.PW5/DA where it\n is not so recorded). In village Simbhavali my statement was\n not recorded by the police. I had signed the panchnama. In\n my presence police officials, had not obtained signature of\n Deepak Sarna on any paper prepared in village Simbhavali.\n In my presence police had not prepared any document to\n establish the fact that accd. Deepak Sarna had gone to\n Village Simbhavali.\"\n\n63. Interestingly, on this aspect PW-6 deposed in the Court that he, PW-5,\nAlok Srivastava and some others followed the police officials to Simbhavali\nvillage in a car and found A-3 there with the police officials and that A-3\n\"had pointed out the well, and told that the dead body was in that well.\" But\nthis deposition was by way of improvement as was evident from the\nfollowing reply in his cross-examination:\n\n \"I had stated to the police in my statement dt. 5. 11. 2000 that\n accd. Deepak had told (disclosed) on 31st Oct. 2000 that he can\n get the dead body recovered from the well. (confronted with Ex.\n PW6/DA where it is not recorded that accd. Deepak had\n disclosed that he can get the dead body recovered from the\n well); (voltd. The statement was recorded by the police officials\n and not by me). I had dictated my statement to the police\n officials. I do not remember as to whether my statement had\n been read over to me or not. I do not remember as to whether I\n got incorporated in my statement Ex.PW6/DA that I had been\n read over the statement and the same is correct. (confronted\n with portion A to A of Ex.PW6/DA where it is so recorded). It\n is wrong to suggest that I am deliberately taking the shelter\n under the head 'I do not remember' to-meet out the material\n omissions. I had told to police officials that accd. Deepak had\n pointed out towards the well in Village Simbhavali and told us\n that the dead body of Manish was lying in that well.\n\n (confronted with Ex.PW6/DA, where it is not so recorded).\"\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 28 of 40\n\n 64. PW-25 himself was unclear on the question of recovery of the dead body\nwhich was supposedly at the instance of A-3, PW-25 stated as under:\n\n \"So far as I remember I did not record stt. U/S 161 \nCr.P.C\n. of\n any witness on 31.10.2000. I had recorded a D.D. Entry in my\n own hand-writing in respect of my visit to village Simbhavali\n on 31.10.2000. I do not remember whether I recorded any DD\n Entry at P.S. Simbhavali on 31.10.2000 in respect of my arrival\n at Simbhavali. I do not remember whether I got signatures of\n accd. Deepak Sarna on any official record of P.S. Simbhavali or\n at the spot in respect of the fact that accused Deepak Sarna was\n taken at Village Simbhavali on 31.10.2000.\"\n\n65. The panchnama (Ex.PW-5/1) shows that it was prepared by a policeman\nat PS Simbhavali and it is not signed by any of the relatives or acquaintances\nof the deceased who are said to have been present there. It refers to certain\nenclosures, none of which appear to have been made part of the case\nproperty. As regards the place of occurrence and as far as the site plan of the\nwell itself, it appears to be drawn up on 4th November, 2000 whereas the\nvisit to that place was undertaken on 31st October, 2000. The stark fact is\nthat all of the seizure memos concerning A-3 were witnessed by three\npolicemen of whom two were not examined. The one who was viz., PW-2\nfailed to support the prosecution. The Court is therefore not satisfied that the\nevidence placed on record proves the recovery of the dead body at the\ninstance of A-3.\n\n66. The recovery of the keys and the jeans pant at the instance of A-1 and A-\n2 has already been disbelieved by the trial Court and therefore, this\ncircumstance also cannot be used to connect A-3, the present Appellant,\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 29 of 40\n\n with the crime. Moreover PW-25 was unclear whether it was A-3, who had\ntold the police about throwing the keys and the jeans pant in the well. The\nfollowing answers given by him bring this out:\n\n \"On 31.10.2000 when I recorded the disc. Stt. of accused\n Deepak Sarna I came to know the fact that pant containing keys\n of deceased were thrown in a well. I have gone through the\n disc. stt. dt. 31.10.2000 Ex.P.W.2/1 There is no such stt.\n regarding throwing of pant with keys of deceased Manish\n Choudhary into well.\"\n\n67. As far as the recovery of the car of the deceased is concerned, it is plain\nthat the said car had already been recovered by the police at PS Dewat\nDistrict, Ghaziabad. No blood stains were found in either that car or the car\nof A-3. The car so recovered was not sent to the FSL for an opinion. No\nchance prints were recovered from such cars. As far as the place of the\nincident itself, the site plan (Ex.PW-25/B) has no signature of any witness.\nNo blood stains were found at the spot. The signature of A-3 is also not\nfound there. This is true also of the site plan of the place of recovery of the\ndead body. It has already been noticed that the weapon of the offence was\nnot recovered. Even the Call Detail Records of the mobile phones of the\ndeceased and of A-3 or even PWs 1 and 6 were not collected. These might\nhave given the police valuable clues of the movement of the deceased and\nthe others on the date he went missing. Not insignificantly, the trial Court\nhas itself commented adversely on the quality of investigation and has\npassed strictures against the IOs in the case.\n\nMotive\n\n68. The Court next examines the motive for the crime. There were three\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 30 of 40\n\n reasons given by the prosecution to explain the motive. One was that the\ndeceased was in a relationship with the sister of A-3 and A-3 was unhappy\nwith this. There is no iota of evidence to prove this motive.\n\n69. The second reason is that the deceased had given A-3 a loan of Rs.\n80,000 to 90,000/- which he wanted to recover. This emerged both in the\nstatement of PW-23 recorded on or after 9th November 2000 (Ex. PW-\n23/DA) and in the supplementary statement of PW-1 (Ex. PW-1/DA)\nrecorded by SI Neeraj Kumar (PW-26) on or after 9th November, 2000 when\nhe took over the investigation. This was not disclosed at the first available\nopportunity either by PW-6 whose complaint (DD 9A) was given on 29 th\nOctober 2000 or PW-1 who gave a complaint on 30th October 2000. These\nstatements were inadmissible as evidence. The legal position has been\nexplained in \nV.K. Mishra v. State of Uttarakhand\n (2015) 9 SCC 588 as\nunder:\n\n \n\"15. \nSection 162\n Code of Criminal Procedure bars use of\n statement of witnesses recorded by the police except for the\n limited purpose of contradiction of such witnesses as indicated\n there. The statement made by a witness before the police Under\n \nSection 161(1)\n Code of Criminal Procedure can be used only\n for the purpose of contradicting such witness on what he has\n stated at the trial as \nlaid down in\n the proviso to \nSection 161(1)\n\n Code of Criminal Procedure. The statements Under \nSection 161\n\n Code of Criminal Procedure recorded during the investigation\n are not substantive pieces of evidence but can be used primarily\n for the limited purpose: (i) of contradicting such witness by an\n accused Under \nSection 145\n of Evidence Act; (ii) the\n contradiction of such witness also by the prosecution but with\n the leave of the Court and (iii) the re-examination of the witness\n if necessary.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 31 of 40\n\n 16. Court cannot suo motu make use of statements to police not\n proved and ask question with reference to them which are\n inconsistent with the testimony of the witness in the court. The\n words in \nSection 162\n Code of Criminal Procedure \"if duly\n proved\" clearly show that the record of the statement of\n witnesses cannot be admitted in evidence straightway nor can\n be looked into but they must be duly proved for the purpose of\n contradiction by eliciting admission from the witness during\n cross-examination and also during the cross-examination of the\n investigating officer. Statement before the investigating officer\n can be used for contradiction but only after strict compliance\n with \nSection 145\n of Evidence Act that is by drawing attention\n to the parts intended for contradiction.\"\n\n70. The third reason viz., the borrowing of 4 to 5 lakhs by A-3 from the\ndeceased has been disbelieved even by the trial Court. PW-1 has admitted\nthat he did not mention in his statement to the police about the deceased\nwearing a gold kada, diamond ring, gold chain and having a purse\ncontaining money and credit cards or the suit and new shirt being in the car.\nIn any case, none of these items were recovered by the police. Consequently,\nthe Court is not satisfied that the prosecution has been able to prove the\nmotive for the commission of the offence. In a case of circumstantial\nevidence, where the other circumstances have not been cogently and\nconclusively proved by the prosecution, the motive for the commission of\ncrime is a critical link and it becomes incumbent on the prosecution to prove\nit if it has to show that the complete chain of circumstances points\nunmistakably to the guilt of the accused. \nIn \nArjun Marik v. State of Bihar\n\n1994 Supp (2) SCC 372, the Supreme Court explained:\n\n \"...mere absence of proof of motive for commission of a crime\n cannot be a ground to presume the innocence of an accused if\n the involvement of the accused is otherwise established. But it\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 32 of 40\n\n has to be remembered that in incidents in which the only\n evidence available is circumstantial evidence then in that event\n the motive does assume importance if it is established from the\n evidence on record that the accused had a strong motive and\n also an opportunity to commit the crime and the established\n circumstances along with the explanation of the accused, if any,\n exclude the reasonable possibility of anyone else being the\n perpetrator of the crime then the chain of evidence may be\n considered to show that within all human probability the crime\n must have been committed by the accused.\"\n\n71. The result of the above discussion is that among the circumstances\noutlined by the trial Court, except the evidence that the deceased was\nperhaps in the company of A-3 till around 10 pm on the night of 28 th\nOctober 2000, the other links in the chain of circumstances viz., the recovery\nof the dead body, the recovery of the clothes and the car of the deceased at\nthe instance of A-3; and importantly, the motive for the commission of the\ncrime have not been conclusively proved by the prosecution. In other words\nthe prosecution has failed to show that it is A-3 and A-3 alone who is\nresponsible for the death of the deceased.\n\n72. \nIn \nSubash Chand v. State of Rajasthan\n 2001 Supp (4) SCR 163, the\nSupreme Court explained that in a case of circumstantial evidence, the Court\nshould:\n\n \"...proceed to examine each of the pieces of incriminating\n circumstantial evidence so as to find out if each one of the\n circumstantial evidence is proved individually and whether\n collectively it forges such a chain of incriminating\n circumstances as would fasten the guilt on the accused beyond\n by shadow of reasonable doubt.\"\n\n73. Further in the same decision, the Supreme Court observed:\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 33 of 40\n\n \"Though the offence is gruesome and revolts the human\n conscience but an accused can be convicted only on legal\n evidence and if only a chain of circumstantial evidence has been\n so forged as to rule out the possibility of any other reasonable\n hypothesis excepting the guilt of the accused. \nIn \nShankarlal\n Gyarasilal Dixit v. State of Maharashtra\n AIR 1981 SC 765, this\n Court cautioned - \"human nature is too willing, when faced with\n brutal crimes, to spin stories out of strong suspicions\". This\n Court has held time and again that between may be true and\n must be true there is a long distance to travel which must be\n covered by clear, cogent and unimpeachable evidence by the\n prosecution before an accused is condemned a convict.\"\n\n74. Incidentally, the case of the prosecution throughout was that five\npersons, including A-3, were involved in the murder. Against two of the\nfive, viz., Arun and Bunti, no charges were framed. The charges were that\nA-1, A-2 and A-3 entered into a criminal conspiracy and pursuant thereto all\nthree of them abducted and killed the deceased and then threw away the\nbody in a well to conceal their crime. With the trial Court having acquitted\nboth A-1 and A-2 \nthe above case\n came apart. The trial Court has proceeded\non the basis that notwithstanding the acquittal of A-1 and A-2, the remaining\naccused viz., A-3 can still be convicted as if he alone abducted and killed the\ndeceased and all by himself disposed of the dead body. But then, that was\nnever the case of the prosecution.\n\nNo substantive charge against A-3 under Sections 302, 364 and 201 IPC\n\n75. This brings us to the question of the error committed by the trial Court in\nconvicting A-3 for the substantive offence under \nSections 302\n, \n364\n and \n201\n\nIPC although no charge to the effect was framed against him. As pointed out\nby Mr. Dubey, there were two charges framed against all three accused. The\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 34 of 40\n\n first was for the offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under \nSection\n120\n -B \nIPC\n and the second for the offences punishable under \nSections\n302\n/\n364\n/\n201\n/\n404\n IPC read with \nSection 120-B\n IPC. With A-1 and A-2\nhaving been acquitted and that acquittal not having been challenged by the\nState, the charge under \nSection 120-B\n IPC had to fail even against A-3.\n\n76. The second charge was against all the three accused collectively and not\nindividually against the present Appellant (A-3). In other words, there was\nno charge against A-3 alone for the substantive offence punishable under\n\nSections 302\n, \n364\n and \n201\n IPC. No move was made by the prosecution to\namend the charges to that effect.\n\n77. This is indeed a fatal flaw as explained in several judgments of the\nSupreme Court. \nIn \nNanak Chand v. State of Punjab\n AIR 1955 SC 274, the\nfacts were that the Appellant along with six other co-accused was charged\nwith committing the offences under \nSection 148\n and Section 302 read with\n\nSection 149\n IPC. The trial Court while acquitting three of the accused,\nconvicted the Appellant and three others for the offence under Section 302\nread with \nSection 34\n IPC. In the further appeal, the High Court acquitted\nthree of the remaining accused of the offence under Section 302 read with\n34 \nIPC\n and convicted them for the offence under \nSection 323\n IPC. It was\nheld that \nSection 34\n IPC did not apply. The High Court convicted the\nAppellant alone for the substantive offence under \nSection 302\n IPC. The\nSupreme Court accepted the submission of the Appellant that this was\nimpermissible in law. It was held: \"The High Court could not do what the\ntrial Court itself could not do, namely, convict under Section 302, as no\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 35 of 40\n\n separate charge had been framed under that section.\"\n\n78. The Supreme Court in \nNanak Chand v. State of Punjab\n (supra) then\ndealt with the plea of the prosecution that this at best was an error in the\nframing of the charge and therefore a curable irregularity. Rejecting that\nplea, the Supreme Court held (referring to the corresponding provisions of\nthe 1898 Cr PC):\n\n \"In the present case, however, there is no question of any\n error, omission or irregularity in the charge because no charge\n under \nsection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code was in fact\n framed. \nSection 232\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n permits an appellate court or a court of revision, if satisfied\n that any person convicted of an offence was misled in his\n defence in the absence of a charge or by an error in the charge,\n to direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in\n whatever manner it thinks fit. In the present case we are of the\n opinion that there was an illegality and not an irregularity\n curable by the provisions of \nsections 535\n and \n537\n of the Code\n of Criminal Procedure. Assuming, however, for a moment that\n there was merely an irregularity which was curable we are\n satisfied that, in the circum- stances of the present case, the\n irregularity is not curable because the appellant was misled in\n his defence by the absence of a charge under \nsection 302of\n the\n Indian Penal Code.\n\n By framing a charge under section 302, read with \nsection\n 149\n of the Indian Penal Code against the appellant, the Court\n indicated that it was not charging the appellant with the\n offence of murder and to convict him for murder and sentence\n him under \nsection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code was to convict\n him of an offence with which he had not been charged. In\n defending himself the appellant was not called upon to meet\n such a charge and in his defence he may well have considered\n it unnecessary to concentrate on that part of the prosecution\n case.\"\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 36 of 40\n\n 79. \nIn \nSuraj Pal v. State of U.P.\n AIR 1955 SC 419, the facts were that the\nAppellant and 19 other accused were charged with committing offences\nunder \nSections 147\n, \n323\n/\n149\n, \n307\n/\n149\n and \n302\n/\n149\n IPC. While the trial\nCourt held all the accused guilty of the various offences, in appeal the High\nCourt set aside the conviction of 10 of the 20 accused. Of the remaining 10\nthe High Court found that nine of them could not be convicted either under\nSection 307/\n149\n or Section 302/149IPC. They were convicted for the\noffence under \nSection 323\n/\n149\n IPC. However, the High Court held the\nAppellant alone guilty of the substantive offences under \nSections 307\n and\n\n302\n IPC. The Supreme Court noted that the specific charges framed referred\nto all of the accused acting together pursuant to a common object and firing\nupon the deceased. There was no amendment to the charge to call upon the\nAppellant to defend himself for the substantive charge for the offences under\n\nSection 302\n and \n307\n IPC as if he was acting alone. The Supreme Court held\nthis to be unsustainable in law and observed:\n\n \"The appellant might well have relied on the absence of any\n such amendment as being an indication that he was not called\n upon to defend himself on the footing of his being the author of\n the pistol fire. In a case so serious as that which involves the\n sentences of transportation for life, and of death, and\n particularly in a case like the present one, where the death\n sentence has been awarded in the trial court by distinguishing\n this appellant from all the other accused in respect of his\n individual act by way of pistol fire, it is difficult to say that the\n accused has not been prejudiced by the absence of specific\n charges under \nsections 307\n and \n302\n, Indian Penal Code.\n\n Further, the medical evidence indicates that P.W. 2 as well as\n the deceased Surajdin had gun-shot wounds on their person.\n The evidence of the Doctor is to the effect that these wounds\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 37 of 40\n\n may have been caused by a country pistol which, it is alleged,\n the appellant had in his hand. It has been suggested on behalf of\n the defence that the Medical Officer was not competent to speak\n about it and that if the prosecution wanted to rely thereupon,\n they should have called an arms expert to speak to the same.\n Whether or not this comment is legitimate, it is clear that if the\n appellant is to be found directly responsible for inflicting the\n wounds, noted as gun-shot wounds by the Medical Officer, he\n might well have availed himself of the opportunity to elucidate,\n by cross-examination or positive defence, the nature of the fire-\n arm which would have caused the actual injuries found on the\n bodies of PW-2 and of deceased Surajdin. In all the\n circumstances above noticed, we are satisfied that the\n absence of specific charges against the appellant\n under \nsections 307\n and \n302\n, Indian Penal Code has\n materially prejudiced him. We must accordingly set aside the\n convictions and sentences of the appellant under \nsections\n 307\n and \n302\n of the Indian Penal Code.\" (emphasis supplied)\n\n80. Again in \nSubran @ Subramaniam v. State of Kerala\n (1993) 3 SCC 32\nthe Supreme Court explained the legal position as under:\n\n \"11. Since, appellant 1 Subran had not been charged for the\n substantive offence of murder under \nSection 302\n IPC, even the\n trial court, which tried the six accused persons, was not justified\n in recording a conviction against him for the substantive\n offence of murder punishable under \nSection 302\n IPC after\n framing a charge against him for the offence under Section 302\n read with \nSection 149\n IPC only. A person charged for an\n offence under \nSection 302\n IPC read with \nSection 149\n cannot be\n convicted, of the substantive offence under \nSection 302\n, IPC\n without a specific charge having been framed against him as\n envisaged by law. Conviction for the substantive offence in\n such a case is unjustified because an accused might be misled in\n his defence by the absence of the charge for the substantive\n offence under \nSection 302\n IPC simpliciter and, therefore, in\n defending himself, he cannot be said to have been called upon\n to meet that charge and he could very well have considered it\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 38 of 40\n\n unnecessary to concentrate on that part of the prosecution case\n during the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses.\n Therefore, the conviction of the first appellant for an offence\n under Section 302 was not permissible.\"\n\n81. In State of West Bengal v. Bindu Laxman Dass 1995 SCC (Crl) 175,\nthe husband and wife were both charged with committing the offence under\n\nSection 302\n/\n34\n IPC. With the husband being acquitted, the wife could not\nhave been convicted for the substantive offence. The Supreme Court\nobserved:\n\n \"Both husband and wife were charged with an offence\n under Section 302 read with \nSection 34\n I.P.C. The charge which\n was based on the common intention of the two failed with the\n acquittal of the husband and there being no charge\n under Section 302 simpliciter against the wife she could not be\n convicted. In any case there is no evidence on the record to\n show that she independently committed the offence.\"\n\n82. In the present case, admittedly there was no charge framed against\nthe Appellant (A-3) for the substantive offences under \nSections 302\n,\n\n364\n and \n201\n IPC. Consequently, the trial Court could not have\nproceeded to convict him for those offences.\n\nConclusion\n\n83. The net result of the above discussion is that the prosecution has not\nbeen able to prove each of the links in the chain of circumstances or that the\nproved circumstances point unmistakably to the guilt of the Appellant. In\nany event, the trial Court erred in convicting the Appellant for the\nsubstantive offences under \nSections 302\n, \n364\n and \n201\n IPC when there was\nno charge framed against him to that effect.\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 39 of 40\n\n 84. The Appellant is accordingly acquitted of the offences punishable under\n\nSections 302\n, \n364\n and \n201\n IPC. The impugned judgment of the trial Court\nand the order on sentence are accordingly set aside.\n\n85. The appeal is allowed. The bail bonds and surety bonds of the Appellant\nstand discharged.\n\n86. The Appellant will fulfil the requirement of \nSection 437-A\n Cr.PC to the\nsatisfaction of the trial Court at the earliest.\n\n87. The trial Court record be returned together with a certified copy of the\njudgment.\n\n S. MURALIDHAR, J.\n\n VINOD GOEL J.\n\nOCTOBER 30, 2018\nrd/mw\n\nCrl.A.174 /2004 Page 40 of 40",

But this does\n not mean that before the prosecution can succeed in a case\n resting upon circumstantial evidence alone, it must exclude\n each and every hypothesis suggested by the accused,\n howsoever, extravagant and fanciful it might be. There must be\n a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable\n ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the\n accused and must show that in all human probability the act\n must have been done by the accused, where various links in\n chain are in themselves complete, then the false plea or false\n defence may be called into aid only to lend assurance to the\n court.\""
