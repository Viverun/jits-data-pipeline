It would be travesty of justice if the\n appellant is denied the pensionary benefits simply on the\n ground that he was not a permanent employee of the\n government. The appellant having served the government for\n almost-two\n two decades it would be unfair to treat him as\n temporary/quasi-permanent.\n\n permanent.\n\n Keeping in view the facts and circumstances\n circumstanc of this case we\n hold that the appellant shall be deemed to have become\n permanent after he served the Government for such a long\n period. The services of the appellant shall be treated to be in\n permanent capacity and he shall be entitled to the pensionary\n benefits. We allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the\n Tribunal and direct the respondents to treat the appellant as\n having been retired from service on 7.3.1980 after serving the\n Government for 18 ½ years More than 10 years of permanent\n service) and d as such his case for grant of pension be finalized\n within six months from the receipt of this order. The appellant\n shall be entitled to all the arrears of pension from the date of\n retirement.\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n(iii) The Hon'ble High Court Patna dealing with identical\nfacts and issue in case of Union of India & Ors Versus Kritnarain\nSingh, CWJC No. 10978 of 2017 decided on 04.9.2017.

The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 having binding statutory force,\nsocial and beneficial legislation to protect fructify the legislative intent to\nextend benefits to long continuous working of casual labourers\n labourers.\n\n18. The Scheme dated 12.4.1991 confers temporary status on\ncasual labourers in employment as on 29.11.1989. The applicant\n applicant is\nappointee of year 198\n 1981 admitted fact and has been requesting to regularize\nand ought to have been superannuated before 30.\n\n 30.11.2020 accordance with\nlaw as regular employee for no fault of applicant made to suffer violating\n\nArticle 14\n, 21\n, 31A\n and \n30\n 3000\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n19. The applicant has been conferred temporary status w.e.f.\n27.04.1997 pursuant to order dated 07.02.1998 (Annexure A-1) and the\nstatutory binding scheme has conferred after 3 years certain advantages to\ntemporary employee as provided in para 2 as to grant of minimum of the\npay scale for a regular group'D' official including DA, HRA and CCA.\nPara 3 provides for benefits of increment at the same rate as applicable to\na Group 'D' employ\n employee\n ee after completion of one year of service from date of\nconferment of Temporary status. The Fundamental Rule 27 stipulates grant\nof increment to a government servant on same scale of pay\n pay. The legislative\nintent is clear as noon day in formulating the sta\n statutory\n tutory scheme dated\n12.4.1991 and writ in the nature of mandamus would certainly lie to\nenforce the terms as social legislation to enhance social welfare and\nachieve social justice. The Central Government being an ideal employer\nfulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policies envisaged in the Part IV\nof the Constitution of India treating temporary status casual labour after\nlong period at par with temporary Group 'D' employee of the Department\ngranting benefits and treating at par with and entitled for such benefits as\nare admissible to the Group 'D' employee on regular basis.

So also Para 8 of the scheme specifically provides for\nconferment of temporary group 'D' status after rendering tthree\n hree years\ncontinuous service as temporary status.\n\n20. The applicant was conferred temporary status on 27.04.1997\nand accordance with Para 8 of the scheme and on principles of beneficial\nconstruction and harmoniously construing the scheme. The applicant after\nthree years since 27.04.1997 meaning thereby since 27.04.2000 has attained\nstatus of temporary Group 'D' employees and regularly contributed to\nG.P.F.

The\n he applicant\nhaving continuously worked as temporar\n temporaryy status casual labourer since\n27.04.1997 and on 27.04.2000 is holder of post of temporary\nemployee/quasi permanent status and deserves to be dealt fairly by the\nmodel employer state accordance with guarantee enshrined in the \nArticle 14\n\nand \n21\n of the Const itution of India. This Tribunal is of the view whereof\n Constitution\nthat it is unfair to continue husband of the applicant such a long in\ntemporary post and without considering for regularizing till retirement.\n\n21.

The Para 17 of statutory scheme also provides in mandatory\nterms no recruitment from open market for Group 'D' posts till casual\nlabourers available to fill up the posts in question. The respondents have\nnot discharged statutory dduty as model employer as envisaged in D.P.S.P.\nPart IV of the Constitution of India and applicant husband not regularized\nas for no fault cannot be made to suffer. The official respondents did not\ndischarge his duty and not regularized on time for own mist\n mistakes\n akes\nrespondents cannot take advantages and plea not even considered for\nregularization available to them that since no regularization no pension etc.\n\n23. The applicant before retirement submitted representation\ndated 31.12.2018 and 11.02.2019 (Annexure A-3)\n A to allow to participate in\nabsorption to regularize services on regular cadre post but no response. The\nrespondents have stated in Para 8 of the written statement that applicant\n // 18 // OA/050/00396/2019\n\ncould not be provided opportunity for regularization as Group 'D' through\nselection\n ection in view of limited vacancies kept for selection of casual\nlabourers. The Para 8 of written statement and averments of OA that\nrespondents not regularized services of applicant remains unrebutted. The\napplicant was never at fault for such lack of re\n regularization.\n\n24.

The D\n Department\n epartment of Posts, Ministry of\nTelecommunication & I.T.

Part IV of\nConstitution. These policy, scheme circulars are substantive attempts to\nenhance social welfare. The respondents denied to employee accrued rights\nand has led to him and his family to a long and tortuous roads to justic\n justice.\n\n e.\n\nHence plea taken by respondents that unless regularized no pensionry\n // 19 // OA/050/00396/2019\n\nbenefits deserves to be rejected and applicant can not be denied relief\nclaimed.\n\n26. The sub-clause\n clause 2 of clause 5 of G.I.D (5) policy dated\n30.11.1992 quoted herein above is also crystal clear that casual labourers of\nthe postal department with effect from date of completion three years of\nservice in newly acquired temporary status becomes entitled to benefits\nadmissible to temporary Group 'D' employee such as counting of service\nfor purpo\n purpose\n se of pension and terminal benefits as in case of temporary\nemployees appointed on regular basis while granting them pension and\nretirement benefits after their regularization.\n\n27.

So far as Rule 2 of Rules 2021 no where\nexcludes temporary employee and Rule 2 explanations (6) of CCS Pension\nRules 2021 are applicable to those temporary employee like applicant.

The applicant stood retired on 30.11.2020 as temporary\nemployee for no fault of own not regularized, respondents did not discharge\nhis duties and no rebuttal in reply to O.A. Whereas Rule 10 of Rules 1965\nread with Rules 2021 and Policy dated 30.11.1992 provides for grant of\npension, family pension and retirement benefits to temporary employee.\nThe status of employee was at par with regular employee on long\ncontinuation on temporary post in welfare state. The Scheme of statutory\nRules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 would prevail over any policy\ndecision.\n\n31. The explanation no. 6 to Rule 2of CCS Pension Rules 2021\nmakes it clear that applicant who stood retired before having been\nappointed in a substantive ccapacity\n apacity as regular cadre employee for such type\nof category of temporary employee benefit of pension Rules i.e Pension,\nretirement gratuity, death gratuity and family pension shall be payable to\napplicant same scale as admissible to permanent servant under CCS\nPension Rules to the extent provided in the CCS (TS) Rules 1965 as under:\n\n under:--\n\n (i) On retirement from service on superannuation or\n invalidation after having rendered continuous\n temporary/quasi permanent service of not less than 10 years.\n\n (ii) On seeking voluntary\n oluntary retirement after completion of 20 years\n of continuous temporary service.\n\n (iii) In event of death while in service.\n\n32. This Tribunal has analyzed in details the relevant statutory\nschemes clarifications, Policies, statutory Rules 1965 read with CCS\nPension Rules 2021 (erstwhile Rules 2017). This Tribunal considered the\nmatter and in view of whereof of the affirm view that Government of India,\nDepartment of P\n Posts\n osts instructions, scheme dated 12.4.1991 letter no. 66-\n 66-\n9/91-SPB\n SPB-II dated 30.11.1992 and Rules 1965 extracted herein above are\nsocial legislation when read conjointly and harmoniously. The Rules 1965\nand the Schemes beneficial legislation makes it clear that temporary status\nin department of posts rendered service not less than ten years in newly\nacquired temporary status becomes entitled for regularization, pension and\npensionery benefits. The failure on the part of respondents to implement\nRule 10 TS Rules 1965 read with Pension Rules 2021 is failure of social\n // 21 // OA/050/00396/2019\n\njustice and social legislation for casual labourers the said legislation is\nsubstantive attempts to enhance social welfare and state as an ideal\nemployer fulfilling the Directive Principles of State Policy envisaged in\nPart IV of the Constitution.\n\n33. Thus respondents can not take advantages of their own wrong\nand lapses and for no fault applicant can not be made to suffer and\napplicant entitled to receive pension as if retired from regular establishment\n hment\nand so also held by Hon'ble Supreme court in para 36 of judgement in case\nof \nPrem Singh versus State of U.P & Ors\n (2019) 10 SCC 516\nreproduced herein above.\n\n34.

Their Lordships in case of Bhikhani Devi\nSLP dismis\n(supra) observed that judgments relied by Tribunal in CWJC 11435/2017\nand 10978/2017 and none of them considered the impact of Circular dated\n15.9.1991 of CPMG Bihar that there is no automatic app\n appointment\n ointment from\ntemporary status to regular Group 'D' unless absorbed as per rules. So also\nTribunal not adjudicated points unless an employee is in regular service in\ncadre, pensionary benefits would not be admissible.\n\n \nThe learned counsel for applicant in rebuttal submitted that\nthe Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court Patna in similar facts and legal\nissue dealt in detail rules applicable in case of \nUnion of India and ors\nversus Meena Devi @ Meena Kunwar CWJC No.\n 7760 of 2015 decided\non 08.12.2022, reported in 2023 (1) PLJR 506 affirming order dated\n20.3.2013 in similar OA No. 164/2008 (Patna) and granted benefits of\nfamily pension arrears as per Rul\n Rulee 10 (2) of Rules 1965 and CCS Pension\nRules 1972 widow of employee died as temporary employee without being\nregularized.\n \nThis Tribunal has considered the submissions of the counsel\nfor the parties and in judgement in case of \nBhikhani Devi\n (supra) previous\ncases not referred to the larger bench perused the ratio \nlaid down by\n their\nLordships in case of \nMeena Devi @ Meena Kunwar\n (supra) decided on\n08.12.2022.

The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case\nof Yashwant Hari Kakkar (supra) has held that it would be travesty of\njustice if retiree denied pensionary benefits simply on ground that he was\nnot a permanent employee not regularized after served for 18 ½ years.\n\n37. \nIn case of Rameshwari Devi versus Union of India, OA\n (CAT Patna Bench) vide order dated 17.01.2022 in case of\nNo.36 of 2021 (CA\nemployee with temporary status, placed reliance on judgment of Yashwant\n 113,, order of\n\nHari Katakkar versus Union of India\n, (1996) 7 SCC 113\nPrincipal Bench in OA No.1287 of 2000.\n\n 2000.

No. 164 of\n2008 (\nMeena Devi vs. Union of India\n) decided on 20.03.2013, upheld in\nCWJC No.7760 of 2015 (\nUnion of India versus Meena Devi\n) vide\njudgment dated 08.12.2022, Hon'\n Hon'ble\n ble High Court, Patna held widow entitled\nfor pension, family pension.\n Reference for consideration before Tribunal in\ncase of Rita Devi (Supra) was whether applicant - widow of Temporary\nStatus at par with Group 'D' - without regularization was entitled for\n for\npension, family pension and benefits this Tribunal vide order dated\n05.07.2023, held applicant's husband be treated as regular Group 'D'\n(MTS) notionally from date of grant of Temporary Status at par with Group\n'D' employee and issue pension, family pens\n pension and benefits with arrears.\n\n39. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah versus Union of India &\nOthers\n O.A.No.145/2019 (CAT Bench Patna) this Tribunal was seisin\nwith issue - whether applicant who retired more than 25 years service as\nTemporary Status at par with Grou\n Group\n p 'D' without regularization is entitled\nfor pension and other retirement benefits? Applicant was selected for\npromotion to MTS, regular post and applicant did not accept and continued\nas Temporary Status and retired as temporary status employee at par wit\n with\n h\nGroup 'D'.

So also Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.10978 of 2017\nupheld order passed by this Tribunal in OA No.900/2012, direct\n directing\n ing\nrespondents to grant pensionary benefits even without regularization under\nold pension scheme.\n\n40. Hon'ble High Court, Patna in above judgments observed that\nas per rules for temporary status employee becomes entitled for pensionary\nbenefits on regularizat\n regularization\n ion with 10 years of qualifying service which\nincludes full service after regularization and 50% service rendered under\ntemporary status. On working for three years as Temporary Status treated at\npar with Group 'D' employee with all benefits at par and if a temporary\nstatus employee is not regularized having served more than 20 years, it can\nonly be due to failure of respondents department. Temporary Status\nemployee officials otherwise meeting conditions for regularization and\npensionary benefits were thus eligible for pension and retirement benefits.\nSo also this Tribunal considered order passed in identical case OA No.143\nof 2018, a Temporary Status employee, not regularized and allowed OA for\ngrant of pension. \nIn case of \nShiv Chandra Sah\n (Supra) vide orderr dated\n21.02.2022, this Tribunal allowed OA, held applicant entitled for pension\nand pensionary benefits taking into account his Temporary Status period as\nQualifying Service and treating his superannuation on 03.11.2018,\nconsidering 50% pension as Tempor\n Temporary\n ary Status as qualifying service and to\nissue Pension Payment Orders expeditiously within four months.\n\n41.

So also\nplaced reliance in case OA No.372/2017 dated 27.03.2018 and order dated\n21.08.2018 in OA No.609 of 2017 in \nRatneshwar Singh\n (Supra) this\nTribunal vide order dated 20.09.2018, allowed OA and directed for fixation\nof pension, grant of gratuity and all other retiral dues in light of judgment\npassed in CWJC No.11435 of 2017 and CWJC No.10978 of 2017 and\norder dated 27.03.2018 passed in OA No.372/2017.\n\n42. Hon'ble High Court Patna in CWJC No.13117 of 2018,\nUnion of India & Ors versus Ratneshwar Singh vide judgment dated\n03.07.2019 upheld this Tribunal order dated 20.09.2018 in OA\nNo.777/2016. Their Lordships considered argument of respondents\ndepartment\n epartment that contention of department cannot be accepted that\napplicant refused promotion to MTS as same cannot be construed that\napplicant had declined regularization on post he was occupying for\nmore than 27 years.\n\n43.
