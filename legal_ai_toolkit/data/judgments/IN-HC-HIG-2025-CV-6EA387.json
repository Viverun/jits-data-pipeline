Rule returnable forthwith. Learned Advocates for the\nrespective parties waive service of notice of Rule. With the\nconsent of the parties matter is taken up for final hearing.\n\n2. The present Revision Application has been filed to challenge\nthe order dated 21.10.2022, passed by the 18th City Civil and\nSessions Court in Civil Suit No. 220 of 2020, whereby the\nLd. Trial Court rejected the application, below Exhibit 80,\nfiled under the provisions of\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the Code\nof Civil Procedure\n, 1908 (\"\nCPC\n\").\n\n3. For convenience, the parties are referred to by their status\nbefore the Ld. Trial Court.\n\n4. The brief facts leading to the present Revision Application\nare as follows. The plaintiffs instituted Civil Suit No. 220 of\n2020, contending that under a partnership deed dated\n04.06.2003, the father of the plaintiffs and the father of\ndefendants Nos. 1/1 to 1/6 had constituted a partnership firm\nunder the name Tirupati Corporation. Upon the demise of\nboth the original partners, and in terms of Clause 12 of the\nsaid partnership deed, the plaintiffs and defendants Nos. 1/1\nto 1/6 became partners of the said firm. The plaintiffs filed\nthe suit seeking a declaration that, pursuant to the agreement\ndated 19.12.1983, they hold an undivided share in the suit\nproperty and further prayed for a direction to be issued to the\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The Plaintiffs also sought to challenge the sale deed, dated\n18.11.2003, executed by defendant No. 4, in favour of\ndefendant No. 5, as well as the sale deed, dated 14.11.2008,\nexecuted by defendants Nos. 1 and 2, in favour of defendant\nNo. 6. A prayer for permanent injunction in respect of the suit\nproperty was also made. Subsequently, defendants Nos. 7 and\n8 were joined as parties, as defendant No. 7 had purchased a\nportion of the suit property on 26.07.2019, and defendant No.\n8 had purchased another portion on 20.02.2021.\n\n6. Defendant No. 7 thereafter filed an application under Order\nVII Rule 11(d)\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n, contending\nthat the suit was not maintainable as (i) it was barred by\n\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, (ii) it was\nbarred by limitation, and (iii) the plaintiffs had no cause of\naction to file the present suit. Upon consideration of the plaint\nand the documents annexed thereto, the Ld. Trial Court, by\norder dated 21.10.2022, dismissed the said application.\nAggrieved thereby, the present Revision Application has been\npreferred.\n\nII. SUBMISSIONS OF THE DEFENDANT - PETITIONER\n\n7. Ld. Senior Advocate Mr. Dhaval Dave has submitted that the\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nApplication under\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure\nis based on three principal grounds: (i) that the Suit\nis barred under\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership Act,\n1932, (ii) that the plaint is barred by the law of limitation, and\n\n(iii) that the Plaintiffs have no legal right or locus to institute\nthe Suit.\n\n8. On the first submission, namely that the Suit is barred by\n\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Ld. Senior\nAdvocate for the Defendant has advanced detailed arguments\nby placing reliance on the cause title of the plaint. It is\npointed out that the Plaintiffs have described themselves as\nthe legal heirs of one of the original partners, namely\nNanubhai Ranchhodbhai Bharwad, whereas Defendant Nos.\n1/1 to 1/6 are described as the legal heirs of the other partner,\nnamely Manibhai Chhaganbhai Patel.\n\n9. It is submitted that a perusal of the Partnership Deed would\nreveal that there were only two partners in the firm, Tirupati\nCorporation. The Plaintiffs in the present Suit, while\nasserting themselves to be the partners of the said firm, have\nsought reliefs arising out of the said partnership deed. The\nSuit, it is urged, proceeds on the footing that the Plaintiffs, as\npartners of Tirupati Corporation, are entitled to specific\nperformance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983, which was\nexecuted in favour of the said firm by Defendant No. 4.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\n10. It is contended that, in view of the provisions of\nSection 69(1)\n\nof the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the Plaintiffs, suing as\npartners of an unregistered firm, cannot maintain the present\nSuit against Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, who are also claimed\nto be partners of Tirupati Corporation. The Plaintiffs have\nsought a direction against Defendant Nos. 3 and 4 to execute\na sale deed exclusively in their favour, although they possess\nno independent or individual right in the Suit property. Their\nclaim, it is submitted, is founded solely on the Agreement\ndated 19.12.1983 entered into by the partnership firm.\n\n11. It is further argued that, though the Plaintiffs have not sought\nany specific relief against the other partners, namely\nDefendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6, the effect of the reliefs claimed is\nthat the Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the Agreement\nin their own favour as partners of Tirupati Corporation. In\nview of the admitted position that the said firm is\nunregistered, the Suit, according to the Ld. Senior Advocate,\nis squarely hit by\nSection 69(1)\nof the Indian Partnership Act,\n1932, and is therefore not maintainable in law.\n\n12. It is further contended by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the\nDefendant that the Plaintiffs have sought to enforce rights\narising from the agreement dated 19.12.1983, against\nDefendant Nos. 2 to 8, who are admittedly not partners of the\nfirm Tirupati Corporation and are complete strangers to the\nsaid transaction. Since the firm is unregistered, any such\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nattempt to enforce contractual rights on behalf of the firm is\nexpressly barred under\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership\nAct, 1932, and the Suit is therefore liable to be rejected as\nbeing barred by law.\n\n13. Moreover, it has been urged that the Plaintiffs have also\nprayed for reliefs challenging the sale deed dated 14.11.2008.\nThe said sale deed, however, was executed by the partnership\nfirm itself through its partner, namely the father of Defendant\nNos. 1/1 to 1/6. The Suit, therefore, is in essence one seeking\nenforcement of contractual rights arising from transactions\nundertaken by an unregistered firm. In view of the statutory\nbar contained in\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership Act,\n1932, such a Suit is not maintainable and must fail at the\nthreshold.\n\n14. Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has relied on the\ndecision in the case of\nFarooq vs. Shandhya Anthraper\n,\n(2018) 12 SCC 580 more particularly paras: 5 and 6 which\nread as under:\n\n\"5. Having heard the learned Senior Counsel\nappearing for the parties, it is clear that the plaint,\nread as a whole, relied upon Clause 25(d) of the\npartnership deed which specifically states that no\npartners of the firm shall without the consent in\nwriting of the other partners be entitled to transfer\nimmovable property belonging to the firm. The\nplaint then goes on to say that the suit schedule\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nproperty was purchased out of the funds of the firm\nfor the purpose of development and sale. In Para 11,\nthe plaintiffs discovered that a sale deed has been\nexecuted by the first defendant. It has been\nspecifically stated that the plaintiffs had never\nconsented to the same and the first defendant has no\nauthority to sell any immovable property belonging\nto the firm.\n\n6. The plaint, read as a whole, leaves no manner\nof doubt that the basis for the suit is\nSection 69\nof\nthe Partnership Act read with Clause 25(d) of the\npartnership deed dated 29-12-1995. Para 18 of the\nplaint does not carry the matter further inasmuch as\nthe only sentence which could possibly be relied\nupon, and which was relied upon by the High Court,\nis that the plaintiffs are entitled to file the suit even\nindependently of the partnership firm. Having found\nthat the basis of the suit is the factume of\npartnership and having relied upon Clause 25(d) of\nthe partnership deed, it is clear that the trial court\ncorrectly found that the bar of\nSection 69\nof the Act\nwas attracted in the facts of this case.\"\n\n15. Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has relied on the\ndecision reported in in the case of Sri Velji Narayan Patel vs.\nSri Jayanti Lal Patel, AIR 2009 Cal. 164 more particularly,\nPara 9, which reads thus:\n\n\"9. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 69\ndisentitles a\npartner or a person on behalf of a partner to sue as\na partner against the firm of a person allegedly to be\na partner unless the firm is registered with the\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nregistrar of firms. Sub-section (2) similarly\ndisentitles the firm to institute a suit against a third\nparty unless the firm is registered. The common\nfeature between Sub-section (1) and Sub-section (2)\nis that such suit must relate to enforcement of right\narising out of a contract of conferred by the Act. If a\nsuit by a partner against a partner or firm does not\nrelate to enforcement of a right arising out of a\ncontract then there is no legal prohibition because\nthe spirit of\nSection 69\neither of Sub-section (1) or of\nSub-section (2) is that such suit must be related to\nenforcement of the right arising from a contract.\nHaving gone through the plaint of the suit it clearly\nappears that the plaintiff instituted the suit as a\npartner for enforcement of his right arising out of\nthe contract. The entire narrative of the plaint is for\ndeclaration that the plaintiff is the owner of 50 per\ncent of the share of the partnership business and for\ndeclaration that he is entitled to enjoy 50 per cent of\nthe said business under the name and style of M/s.\nBhagat & Company, for production of books of\naccounts, statement of accounts, balance-sheet and\nother documents and for declaration that the\ndefendant is liable to disburse and pay plaintiffs\nshare of profit in the business. Plaintiff does not sue\nin his individual capacity. The prayers in the plaint\nare basically for enforcement of his right as\nembodied in the partnership deed which was\nexecuted by and between the parties on 15th of\nApril, 2000. In such circumstances, the provision of\nSub-section (1) of\nSection 69\nappears to have hit the\nplaint. Order 7, Rule 11(d) contains \"where the suit\nappears from the statement in the plaint to be barred\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nby any law\". It is not the case in the plaint that the\nfirm was registered with the Registrar of Firms.\"\n\n16. The defendant has relied on the decision in the case of\n\nSunkari Tirumala Rao vs. Penki Aruna Kumari\n, 2025 SCC\nOnline 125, more particularly Paras 8 and 9 which read thus:\n\n\"8. It is evident from a reading of sub-sections (1)\nand (2) of\nSection 69\nthat it assumes a mandatory\ncharacter.\nSection 69(1)\nprohibits a suit amongst the\npartners of an unregistered partnership firm, for the\nenforcement of a right either arising from a contract\nor conferred by the Act, unless the suit amongst the\npartners is in the nature of dissolution of the\npartnership firm and/or rendition of accounts.\n\nSection 69(2)\nprohibits the institution of a suit by an\nunregistered firm against third persons for the\nenforcement of a right arising from a contract. As a\nconsequence, a suit filed by an unregistered\npartnership firm and all proceedings arising\nthereunder, which fall within the ambit of\nSection 69\n\nwould be without jurisdiction.\n\n9. This Court in\nSeth Loonkaran Sethiya and Others\nv. Mr. Ivan E. John and Others\nreported in (1977) 1\nSCC 379 had categorically held that\nSection 69\nis\nmandatory in character and a suit instituted by a\nplaintiff in respect of a right which was vested in\nhim by virtue of a contract and entered into in his\ncapacity as a partner of a partnership firm, would\nbe void, if such a firm was unregistered. The\nrelevant observations are as under:\n\n\"21. A bare glance at the section is enough to\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nshow that it is mandatory in character and its\neffect is to render a suit by a plaintiff in respect\nof a right vested in him or acquired by him\nunder a contract which he entered into as a\npartner of an unregistered firm, whether\nexisting or dissolved, void. In other words, a\npartner of an erstwhile unregistered\npartnership firm cannot bring a suit to enforce\na right arising out of a contract falling within\nthe ambit of\nSection 69\nof the Partnership Act.\nIn the instant case, Seth Sugan Chand had to\nadmit in unmistakable terms that the firm\n\"Sethiya & Co.\" was not registered under the\n\nIndian Partnership Act\n. It cannot also be denied\nthat the suit out of which the appeals have\narisen was for enforcement of the agreement\nentered into by the plaintiff as partner of\nSethiya & Co. which was an unregistered firm.\nThat being so, the suit was undoubtedly a suit\nfor the benefit and in the interest of the firm and\nconsequently a suit on behalf of the firm. It is\nalso to be borne in mind that it was never\npleaded by the plaintiff, not even in the\nreplication, that he was suing to recover the\noutstandings of a dissolved firm. Thus, the suit\nwas clearly hit by\nSection 69\nof the Partnership\nAct and was not maintainable.\"\n\n17. Reliance has also been placed on the decision reported in in\nthe case of\nPathik Udayan Bhatt vs. Shakti Infotec and\nOthers\n, 2024 SCC Online Guj 4221 more particularly Para\n21 which reads thus:\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\n\"21. With the help of learned advocate for the\npetitioner, I have perused the plaint of Regular Civil\nSuit No.600 of 2016 filed by the plaintiffs-\n\nrespondents, which is at Annexure-B to this petition,\nand upon bare perusal of the entire plaint, I am\nunable to find out anywhere in the plaint a single\naverment that the respondent No.1- is a registered\nfirm, and as such, I find merit in the contention\ncanvassed by the learned advocate for the applicant\nthat in the absence of any assertion made in the\nplaint by the respondents that their firm is a\nregistered firm, and in the absence of any\ndocumentary evidence being produced by them in\nsupport thereof, the suit instituted by the\nrespondents is hit by the provisions of\nSection 69\nof\nthe Indian Partnership Act, and when the suit is\nbarred by any law, as per Clause 11(d) of Order VII,\nthe same is required to be dismissed at the\nthreshold.\"\n\n18. With regard to the contention that no cause of action has\narisen for the Plaintiffs to institute the present Suit, it has\nbeen submitted by the Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant\nthat the Plaintiffs themselves have specifically pleaded in the\nplaint that there were only two partners in the partnership\nfirm Tirupati Corporation as on 01.04.1982, each having a\n50% share in the partnership property. The Plaintiffs claim to\nhave become partners of the said firm by virtue of Clause 13\nof the partnership deed dated 04.06.2003, which provides that\nupon the death of a partner, his legal heirs, if willing, may be\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

It is further contended that the record clearly establishes that,\nthe father of the Plaintiffs, who was one of the two partners,\nexpired on 23.12.2010. Consequently, it is urged that in view\nof there being only two partners, the partnership firm stood\nautomatically dissolved upon the death of one of them, by\noperation of\nSection 42(c)\nof the Indian Partnership Act,\n1932. The Ld. Senior Advocate has submitted that even if the\npartnership deed contains a clause permitting legal heirs to be\nadmitted as partners, such stipulation cannot override the\nstatutory consequence of dissolution upon the death of one of\nthe two partners. A partnership consisting of only two\npartners cannot, upon the death of one, continue as a validly\nexisting firm, nor can a third party be inducted thereafter,\nsince there remains no subsisting contract of partnership to\nsupport such induction.\n\n20. On that basis, it is argued that the Plaintiffs, who claim to be\nthe legal heirs of the deceased partner, cannot assert any right\nas partners of Tirupati Corporation, as the firm itself ceased\nto exist upon the death of their father. Consequently, the\nPlaintiffs could not have instituted the present Suit on the\nfooting that they are partners of the said firm or that the firm\ncontinues to subsist. It has therefore been strongly urged that\nthe plaint discloses no cause of action in favour of the\nPlaintiffs and that the Suit, having been filed by persons who\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has further\ncontended that the plaint is hopelessly barred by limitation. It\nis submitted that the Plaintiffs seek specific performance of\nan agreement dated 19.12.1983, along with a declaration to\ncancel the sale deed dated 18.11.2003 executed by Defendant\nNo. 4 in favour of Defendant No. 5, and to set aside another\nsale deed dated 14.11.2008, executed by Defendant Nos. 1\nand 2 in favour of Defendant No. 6. It is pointed out that a\nbare perusal of the sale deed dated 14.11.2008 makes it\nevident that it was executed by the partners of the firm\nTirupati Corporation itself. Hence, it is submitted that the\nPlaintiffs were fully aware of the said transaction, and\ntherefore, the plea of ignorance or discovery at a later stage\ncannot be sustained.\n\n22. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Defendant has also\nsubmitted that a plain reading of the plaint would reveal that\nthe Plaintiffs are challenging sale deeds executed as far back\nas the year 2003, while the present Suit has been instituted\nonly in the year 2020. It is emphasised that the plaint is\nentirely silent as to when the Plaintiffs first acquired\nknowledge of the impugned transactions. The record further\nindicates that the father of the Plaintiffs passed away in the\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

It is urged that the Plaintiffs have, with a view to circumvent\nthe bar of limitation, inserted vague and general averments in\nthe plaint without any specific or concrete disclosure of dates\nor events. Such vague assertions, it is contended, are\ninsufficient to extend or save limitation under law. In the\nabsence of specific pleadings disclosing how and when the\ncause of action arose, or when the Plaintiffs allegedly came to\nknow of the impugned transactions, the Suit cannot be treated\nas within limitation. Hence, it is submitted that the plaint is\nliable to be rejected as being barred by the law of limitation.\n\n24. Tirupati Corporation, the firm, had jointly instituted Civil\nSuit No. 1435 of 2003, in which Defendant No. 5 was also\nimpleaded. That Suit sought injunctive relief but did not\ninclude any prayer for specific performance of the agreement\ndated 19.12.1983. This, according to the Ld. Senior\nAdvocate, clearly establishes that even as early as the year\n2003, the parties were aware of the execution of the sale\ndeeds and the transactions concerning the suit property.\n\n25. It has also been contended that the entire case of the Plaintiffs\nis founded upon the agreement dated 19.12.1983, entered into\nbetween Defendant No. 3 and the partnership firm. However,\nDefendant No. 3 himself was not the owner of the suit\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Therefore, the\ncause of action, if any, for seeking specific performance arose\nin favour of the partnership firm as far back as 15.12.1983.\nThe present Suit having been instituted only in the year 2020,\nafter an inordinate lapse of nearly thirty-seven years, is\nclearly barred by limitation, and the plaint deserves to be\nrejected on that ground alone.\n\n26. In that view of the matter it has been argued that as the main\nrelief sought in the plaint being barred under the provision of\nSection 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1832 and the\nancillary relief with respect to challenge to sale deed is also\nbarred by law of limitation and in view of the death of\noriginal partners i.e., father of plaintiff and the father of\ndefendant no.1/1/ to 1/6, no cause of action has arisen for the\nplaintiff to file the suit, the order that has been passed by trial\nCourt is not reasoned order and the trial Court has not dealt\nwith arguments as to how the plaint is maintainable in view\nof Section 69 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1832 and\n\nLimitation Act\nand in view of facts stated in the application,\nthe plaintiff has no cause of action to file the suit, the trial\nCourt could not have rejected the application and the present\nCivil Revision Application is required to be allowed and the\nplaint is required to be rejected.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF - RESPONDENT\n\n27. Per Contra, Ld. Senior Advocate Mr. Sanjay Mehta,\nappearing for the Plaintiffs, has submitted that while\nconsidering an Application under\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, the Court is required to confine its\nexamination to the averments made in the Plaint and the\ndocuments annexed thereto. It is only upon such\nconsideration that the Court can determine whether the plaint\nis barred by law.\n\n28. It is submitted that, in the present case, there is no dispute\nthat both the original partners namely, the father of the\nPlaintiffs and the father of Defendant Nos. 1/1 to 1/6 have\npassed away, resulting in the dissolution of the partnership\nfirm. The Plaintiffs, being the legal heirs of one of the\npartners, have instituted the present Suit seeking reliefs in\nrespect of the property belonging to the dissolved firm.\nTherefore, the bar under\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership\nAct, 1932, would not apply to the present case, as the Suit\ndoes not concern the enforcement of contractual rights arising\nout of a subsisting partnership, but rather relates to the\ndivision and distribution of assets belonging to the dissolved\nfirm. Hence, the present property will have to be divided\nbetween the Partners.\n\n29. Mr. Mehta has further drawn my attention to Paragraph 4 of\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

It is pointed out that\nDefendant No. 4, being the owner of the suit property, had\nearlier entered into an agreement with Defendant No. 3 on\n12.02.1982. Relying upon the terms and conditions of the\nAgreement dated 15.12.1983, it is submitted that the said\nagreement expressly records that Defendant No. 3, as the\nsignatory, was under an obligation to execute a sale deed in\nfavour of the Plaintiff and/or his nominee.\n\n30. Further, placing reliance on the Agreement dated 19.12.1983\n(entered into between the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 3), it is\nsubmitted that an additional sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- was paid\nby the Plaintiff to Defendant No. 3. Consequently, possession\nof the suit property was handed over to the Plaintiff in\npursuance thereof. On the basis of these recitals, it is\ncontended that possession of the suit property continues to\nremain with the Plaintiff, and hence, the reliefs sought in the\nSuit are also for protection of such lawful possession in\naddition to the other consequential declarations.\n\n31.

The Plaintiffs, contended that\nthere were neither aware of the filing of the said Suit nor of\nits subsequent withdrawal, and they first came to know of\nthese facts only at a later stage. It is therefore submitted that\nthe Plaintiffs cannot be non-suited on the basis of\nproceedings of which they had no knowledge or participation.\n\n32. The Ld. Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has further drawn\nthe attention of this Court to Civil Suit No. 2231 of 2003,\nwhich had been instituted by Defendant No. 3, the executor\nof the agreement dated 15.12.1983. It is submitted that the\nsaid Suit was one for specific performance of the contract\nexecuted by the original owner, Defendant No. 4, in favour of\nDefendant No. 3. The said Suit, however, came to be\ndismissed for default, and an Application for its restoration is\npresently pending adjudication.\n\n33. The Ld.

Senior Advocates for the respective\nparties and upon a perusal of the Plaint in the present Suit\nalong with its documents, the following position emerges on\nrecord:\n\ni. The Suit has been instituted by the partners of Tirupati\nCorporation, and a categorical assertion is made in\nParagraph 2 of the Plaint that the Plaintiffs are\npartners of the said firm. Defendant No. 1 has been\nimpleaded in the Suit in the capacity of being a partner\nof Tirupati Corporation.\n\nii. It is further stated in the Plaint that the partnership\nfirm Tirupati Corporation has not been dissolved.\n\niii. Though the Agreement of 1983 was entered into\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The Plaint itself records that Tirupati Corporation\nconsisted of only two partners, namely, Nanubhai\nRanchhodbhai Bharvad, the predecessor of the\nPlaintiffs, and Manilal Chhaganlal Patel, the\npredecessor of Defendant No. 1, and that both the said\npartners have since expired.\n\nv. The Plaint also discloses that Defendant Nos. 1/1 to\n1/6 have been joined in the present proceedings in\ntheir capacity as partners of the firm, having\nsucceeded to the interest of the deceased partner,\nManibhai Chhaganbhai Patel.\n\nvi. The Plaintiffs have instituted the present Suit as the\nlegal heirs of Nanubhai Ranchhodbhai Bharvad. The\nreliefs claimed, however, are not for specific\nperformance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983 either\nin favour of the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation\nor jointly in favour of the legal heirs of both deceased\npartners, but solely in favour of the Plaintiffs.\n\nvii.

The record further\nindicates that Defendant No. 3 had earlier filed a\nseparate Suit for specific performance of the\nagreement executed in his favour by Defendant Nos. 4\nand 5, which came to be dismissed (Restoration\nApplication for which, is pending).\n\nviii. It is also an admitted position that a separate Civil\nSuit, being Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003, had been\ninstituted by the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation\nseeking injunctive relief. However, even at that stage,\nno relief for specific performance of the agreement\ndated 19.12.1983 had been sought for and on behalf of\nthe partnership firm and the said Suit was\nsubsequently withdrawn on 03.08.2012.\n\n36. The Plaintiff asserts his right of possession over the suit\nproperty on the basis of the agreement executed on\n19.12.1983, claiming that such possession flows from and is\nprotected under the terms of the said Agreement.\n\nCause of Action\n\nSection 42(C)\nof the Partnership Act\n\n37. First and foremost, under the provisions of\nSection 42(c)\nof\nthe Indian Partnership Act, 1932, a partnership stands\ndissolved by the death of a partner unless there exists a\nspecific contract to the contrary. The statute proceeds on the\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nprinciple that a partnership is founded upon mutual trust,\nconfidence, and personal consent among the partners.\nConsequently, when one of the partners dies, the relationship\nof mutual agency, which is the essence of a partnership,\nceases to exist. In the absence of a clear agreement permitting\ncontinuation after the death of a partner, the dissolution\noccurs automatically by operation of law.\n\n38. In the present case, the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation\nconsisted of only two partners, namely Nanubhai\nRanchhodbhai Bharvad, the predecessor of the Plaintiffs, and\nManilal Chhaganlal Patel, the predecessor of Defendant No.\n\n1. Upon the death of either partner, the firm could not legally\ncontinue to exist because a partnership requires at least two\nliving persons to constitute its foundation. The clause in the\npartnership deed permitting induction of legal heirs upon the\ndeath of a partner cannot revive or reconstitute a partnership\nthat has already stood dissolved. Such induction can only\noccur where the partnership continues to exist.\n\n39. Therefore, upon the death of either partner, the firm stood\ndissolved under\nSection 42(c)\nof the Indian Partnership Act,\n1932. Once dissolved, the partnership firm ceased to have\nany legal existence, and no partner or legal heir could\nmaintain or defend any proceedings in the name of that firm.\nThe Plaintiffs' claim, therefore, proceeds from a non-existent\nentity and cannot be sustained in law.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Considering the aforesaid undisputed facts, it is evident that\nthe dispute in the present proceedings arises out of claims\nadvanced by the partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation,\nwho have filed the Suit asserting rights derived from the\nFirm. The Firm has a Contract/Agreement with Defendant\nNo. 3.\n\n41. The Plaintiffs further seek to assert possession and ownership\nby invoking the principle of part performance under the\nsupplementary agreement dated 19.12.1983, which too was\nexecuted by Defendant No. 3. Consequently, the Plaintiffs\nhave sought specific performance of the agreement dated\n19.12.1983 in their favour.\n\n42. It further appears from the record that the Plaintiffs have\ninstituted the present Suit in their capacity as partners of the\nfirm Tirupati Corporation, yet the relief sought is for specific\nperformance of the agreement dated 19.12.1983 exclusively\nin their own favour. The agreement, however, was executed\nwith the partnership firm and not with the individual partners.\nTherefore, while the Plaintiffs claim to represent the firm, the\nreliefs prayed for are personal in nature and not on behalf of\nthe firm, thereby creating an inconsistency between the\ncapacity in which the Suit is filed and the nature of the reliefs\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

At the present juncture, it is apposite to refer to\nSection 15\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963:\n\n15.

However, the record makes it abundantly clear that the\npartnership firm Tirupati Corporation is no longer in\nexistence, having stood dissolved upon the death of its two\npartners. There is no dispute between the parties on this.\nSince there were only two partners, the demise of one\nresulted in the automatic dissolution of the firm.\n\n45. That having dissolved, there is no disclosure of any cause of\naction for the Plaintiff to seek specific performance of the\nContract. That too, only qua the Plaintiffs. Therefore, in\nessence, it is not even a specific performance of the said\nContract. This is because, there is no Contract with the\nPlaintiff, of which the Plaintiff can seek performance.\n\n46. In Round the Clock Stores Ltd. v. Aggarwal Entertainment\nPvt. Ltd., 2008 SCC Online Del 1786, the Delhi High Court\non interpretation of\nSection 15\nof the 1963 Act held as under:\n\n7. So far as adjudication in the present\napplication is concerned, it becomes necessary to\nexamine the necessary provisions which stipulate as\nto who would be a proper party in a suit for specific\nperformance.\nSection 15\nof the Specific Relief Act,\n1963 clearly stipulates that only the two persons\nwho have entered into the alleged\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

By virtue of\nSection 15\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act, 1963, specific performance\nof a contract can be obtained by any party thereto\nor by the representative in interest or the principal,\nof any party thereto or by the persons who have\nbeen set out in\nSection 15\nof the statute.\n\n47. However, the term \"representative in interest\" has been\ninterpreted by the Hon'ble Apex Court in several judgments\nand the present Plaintiffs do not fall in the said category [see:\n\nKapilaben and Ors. v. Ashok\nkumar Jayantilal Sheth,\n(2020) 20 SCC 648 Para 24].\nIt does not even appear to be\nthe Plaintiff's case that they are representatives in interest of\nthe Firm. Had that been so, even the Defendant Nos. 1/1 to\n1/6 would stand on a similar footing.\n\n48. One other strange relief as sought for in the Plaint is to grant\nspecific performance of the Contract qua the Plaintiffs only.\nTherefore also, the prayer in effect, is not of specific\nperformance of the Contract. This is because, the Contract as\nentered into between the parties is required to be enforced.\nThe Plaintiff cannot seek enforcement of the said Agreement\nin its favour alone. Therefore also, the present suit does not\ndisclose any cause of action.\n\n49.

There is no manner in which the\nspecific performance of the Contract can be sought qua the\nPlaintiffs alone.\n\n50. If the argument of the Plaintiff is that the Contract had\nstipulated that sale deed can be executed qua anyone that the\nproposed vendee stipulates, it cannot be countenanced\nbecause, the Plaintiff is not the proposed vendee in its\nindividual capacity, but the Firm.\n\nIllusory Cause of Action\n\n51. A further aspect that merits consideration is the conduct of\nthe Plaintiffs, which reflects clear approbation and\nreprobation. On one hand, for the purpose of overcoming the\nstatutory bar under\nSection 69\nof the Indian Partnership Act,\nthe Plaintiffs seek to disown the existence of the firm Tirupati\nCorporation, contending that the firm stood dissolved upon\nthe death of its partners and that the present Suit is filed in\ntheir individual capacity. On the other hand, for the purpose\nof asserting cause of action and claiming rights under the\nagreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983, the Plaintiffs\nproject themselves as partners of the same firm and seek\nspecific performance of contracts executed in favour of that\nfirm.\n\n52.

The principle of\nconsistency and fairness demands that a litigant cannot take\nmutually destructive stands in order to derive advantage from\nboth. Once the Plaintiffs themselves admit that the\npartnership firm has ceased to exist, they cannot\nsimultaneously claim contractual rights in its name or through\nits agreements.\n\n53. This inconsistent approach clearly demonstrates that the Suit\nis based on contradictory and self-defeating pleadings,\ncreating no enforceable right in law. Such litigation, founded\non shifting stands and mutually irreconcilable contentions,\nfalls squarely within the mischief of Order VII Rule 11(d)\nof\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\nand deserves rejection at the\nthreshold.\n\n54. The Plaint, on a plain reading, discloses no real or subsisting\ncause of action. The Plaintiffs have sought to assert a right on\nthe basis of an agreement allegedly entered into by the\npartnership firm Tirupati Corporation on 15.12.1983 and\n19.12.1983. However, the firm itself stands dissolved upon\nthe death of its partners, and the Suit has been filed many\ndecades thereafter.

Even if the averments made in the Plaint are\ntaken at their highest value, the cause of action so pleaded is\nillusory, and does not create any enforceable right in law.\n\n55. In the present case, it is evident from the averments in the\nPlaint that the Suit is hopelessly barred by limitation. The\nPlaintiffs and their predecessors were aware of all material\nfacts, including the agreements of 1983 and the subsequent\nsale deeds executed in 2003 and 2008. The record also\nreflects that the erstwhile partners themselves filed a Civil\nSuit in 2003, but did not claim specific performance at that\ntime. It is, therefore, clear that the present Plaint has been\ndrafted merely to create an artificial and non-existent cause of\naction in an attempt to overcome the statutory bar. Such a\nfictitious or illusory cause of action cannot confer jurisdiction\nupon the Court to entertain the Suit.\n\n56. The legislative intent behind Order VII Rule 11(d)\nof the\nCode of Civil Procedure\nis to prevent the abuse of the judicial\nprocess and to protect litigants from being subjected to\nneedless trials in cases where the plaint, on its face, is barred\nby law. When the plaint itself reveals that the claim is legally\nuntenable, it becomes the duty of the Court to reject it at the\nthreshold. Courts must not permit litigants to engage in\nspeculative or vexatious litigation, which only serves to\nprolong proceedings and harass the opposite party.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

In this context, it has been repeatedly emphasised by the\nHon'ble Supreme Court that the power under Order VII Rule\n11(d) is intended to strike down sham, frivolous and\nvexatious claims at inception. To allow such suits to proceed\ndespite clear legal bars would defeat the very object of the\nprovision and burden the judicial system with unnecessary\ntrials. The Court is not expected to permit a litigant to rely\nupon a hollow or illusory cause of action to gain entry into\nthe judicial process. In the present case, therefore, the plaint\nbeing barred by limitation and by the provisions of\nSection 69\n\nof the Partnership Act, and disclosing no legally sustainable\ncause of action, deserves to be rejected at the threshold.\n\nBarred by Law\n\nLimitation to seek specific performance -\nArticle 54\n\n58. Apart from the fact that the there was no cause of action for\nthe Plaintiff to sue the Defendants seeking specific\nperformance of the Contract qua the Plaintiffs alone, such an\naction is also barred by limitation on the following count.\n\n59. As on today, the Partnership Firm does not exist. This has\nbeen admitted by both the parties. This is in view of\nSection\n49(C)\nof the Partnership Act.

However, even during the subsistence of the Partnership\nFirm, a Suit had been instituted as Civil Suit No. 1435 of\n2003 by Tirupati Corporation, represented by the\npredecessors of the Plaintiffs and Defendant No. 1. In that\nSuit, Defendant Nos. 3 to 5 were also parties, yet no relief for\nspecific performance of the agreement was sought. This\ncircumstance indicates that even during the lifetime of the\noriginal partners, the partnership firm did not claim any\nenforceable right arising from the agreement dated\n19.12.1983.\n\n61. Therefore, it is clear that at least in the year 2003, the\nPartnership Firm (through its partners) was aware and had\nknowledge of the Agreement and fact that the same was not\nspecifically enforced.\n\n62.\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act\nis reproduced hereinunder\nfor ready reference:\n\nParticulars Period Time from which the period\ncommences to run\n\nFor specific Three years The date fixed for the\nperformance of performance, or, if no such\na Contract date is fixed, when the\nplaintiff has notice that\nperformance is refused.\n\n63.

Having known the same\nand being aware of it, the Firm at the relevant time did not\nseek specific performance of the Agreement of 1983.\n\n64. Though the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that cause of action\nfor filing a suit for injunction and specific relief is separate\nand distinct, Order II Rule 2 may not apply to bar a later suit\nfor specific performance. However, the limitation to file such\na suit for specific performance cannot be stopped by any of\nthe parties.\n\n65. The said previous Suit was instituted by the Firm only for the\npurpose of seeking an injunction and was ultimately\nwithdrawn on 03.08.2012. This clearly establishes that the\nfact of execution of the agreement was well within the\nknowledge of the erstwhile partners of the firm Tirupati\nCorporation. Despite such knowledge, no Suit for specific\nperformance was instituted by them within the prescribed\nperiod of limitation as contemplated under\nArticle 54\nof the\n\nLimitation Act, 1963\n.\n\n66. In view of these facts, it cannot be accepted that the Plaintiffs\nwere unaware of the existence or execution of the agreements\ndated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983 or of the refusal by\nDefendant No. 4 to execute the sale deed.

Therefore, some questions\nwhich can legitimately arise such a situation are (i)\nWhether the Plaintiff could have reasonably known\nabout a transaction? (ii) Could that factum of\nexecution of the transaction be discovered by the\nPlaintiff by due diligence? (iii) What is the nature of\nright that the Plaintiff claims to hold over the\nproperty?

The Plaintiff has validly pleaded\nmaterial and exact dates of acquiring\nknowledge, etc. and has pleaded a\ncause of action which is triable [cases\nto the likes of Daliben, Chhotanben,\netc.]\nii. The Plaintiff has made vague\naverments, pleaded illusory cause,\ninasmuch as has pleaded such\naverments which outright show that\nthe date of knowledge as pleaded by\nthe Plaintiff is a false contention by\nway of clever drafting.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

If\nthe cause of action is illusory, vexatious or\nfrivolous as being outright sham.\n\n70. In the present case, the plea of the Plaintiffs that they were\nunaware of the execution of the sale deeds cannot be\naccepted. The sale deed executed by Defendant No. 4 in\nfavour of Defendant No. 5 in the year 2003 and the\nsubsequent sale deed executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in\nfavour of Defendant No. 6 in the year 2008 are both\nregistered documents, forming part of the public record.\nUnder settled law, registration of a document constitutes\ndeemed notice to all persons claiming any interest in the\nproperty. The Plaintiffs, being successors of the original\npartners of Tirupati Corporation, were bound to be aware of\ntransactions affecting the property that formed part of the\nfirm's assets. The record further shows that even in the year\n2003, a Civil Suit was filed by the erstwhile partners\nconcerning the same property, thereby affirming their\nknowledge of the transactions. Hence, the Plaintiffs cannot\nnow claim ignorance or seek to revive their right after\ndecades.

Another relevant aspect that requires consideration is that the\npresent Suit has been instituted by the Plaintiffs claiming\nrights on behalf of the partnership firm. A reading of the\naverments in the Plaint makes it evident that the Plaintiffs\nassert their entitlement to the suit property by virtue of the\nPartnership Deed, under which they claim to have become\npartners upon the demise of their father.\n\n72. Reliance has been placed on Clause 12 of the said partnership\ndeed to contend that, as the legal heirs of the deceased\npartner, the Plaintiffs have stepped into his shoes and thereby\nacquired the rights and interests of a partner in respect of the\nsuit property.\n\n73. If the partnership deed and the existence of the partnership\nfirm are excluded from consideration in the Suit, the\nPlaintiffs would have no independent or individual right in\nthe suit property. Their entire claim is founded upon the\nrights allegedly flowing from the partnership firm and the\npartnership deed. In the absence of such partnership or any\ncontractual nexus directly conferring ownership or possessory\nrights upon the Plaintiffs, no personal or separate entitlement\nin the suit property can be said to exist in their favour.\n\n74.

The rights and obligations under such\nan agreement vest in the firm as a collective entity, and once\nthe firm stands dissolved, those rights cannot be individually\nenforced by a former partner, especially qua themselves\nalone. Any attempt by a partner to seek specific performance\nin a personal capacity, in relation to a contract entered into\nwith the firm, is impermissible.\n\n75. In this background, it is apposite to consider\nSection 69\nof the\nPartnership Act into account:\n\n\"69. Effect of non-registration. --(1) No suit to\nenforce a right arising from a contract or conferred\nby this Act shall be institutes in any Court by or on\nbehalf of any person suing as a partner in a firm\nagainst the firm or any person alleged to be or to\nhave been a partner in the firm unless the firm is\nregistered and the person suing is or has been\nshown in the Register of Firms as a partner in the\nfirm.\n\n(2) No suit to enforce a tight arising from a contract\nshall be instituted in any Court by or on behalf of a\nfirm against any third party unless the firm is\nregistered and the persons suing are or have been\nshown in the Register of Firms as partners in the\nfirm.\n\n(3) The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall\napply also to a claim of set-off or other proceeding\nto enforce a right arising from a contract, but shall\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The fact remains that the present Suit has been instituted to\nenforce rights arising out of a contractual obligation and has\nbeen filed by persons suing in the capacity of partners of the\nfirm. However, such a Suit is not maintainable unless the\npartnership firm is duly registered and the persons suing are\nshown as partners in the Register of Firms, as contemplated\nunder the\nIndian Partnership Act, 1932\n. In the present case,\nthe Plaintiffs are admittedly not recorded as partners in the\nRegister of Firms, and since the firm itself is unregistered, the\nSuit could not have been instituted in law.\n\n77. Moreover, in view of sub-section (2) of\nSection 69\nof the\nIndian Partnership Act, 1932, the Plaintiffs are seeking to\nenforce a right arising out of a contract against Defendant\nNos. 2 to 8. As the firm in question is unregistered, such\nenforcement is expressly barred under the said provision.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Sandhya Antraper\n, 2018 (12) SCC 580, it has\nbeen held at paragraph No. 5 and 6 as under:\n\n\"5. Having heard the learned Senior counsel\nappearing for the parties, it is clear that the plaint,\nread as a whole, relied upon clause 25 (d) of the\nPartnership Deed which specifically states that no\npartners of the firm shall without the consent in\nwriting of the other partners be entitled to transfer\nimmovable property belonging to the firm. The\nplaint then goes on to say that the suit schedule\nproperty was purchased out of the funds of the firm\nfor the purpose of development and sale. In\nparagraph 11, the plaintiffs discovered that a sale\ndeed has been executed by the first defendant. It has\nbeen specifcally stated that the plaintiffs had never\nconsented to the same and the first defendant has no\nauthority to sell any immovable property belonging\nto the firm.\n\n6. The plaint, read as a whole, leaves no manner\nof doubt that the basis of the suit is\nSection 69\nof the\nPartnership Act read with clause 25 (d) of the\nPartnership Deed dated 29th December, 1995.\nParagraph 18 of the plaint does not carry the matter\nfurther inasmuch as the only sentence which could\npossibly be relied upon, and which was relied upon\nby the High Court, is that the plaintiffs are entitled\nto file the suit even independently of the partnership\nfirm.

In the present case, the Plaintiffs have not instituted the Suit\nin their individual capacity but have done so in their capacity\nas partners of the firm Tirupati Corporation. This position is\nevident from the averments made in the Plaint, which clearly\nstate that the Suit has been filed by the Plaintiffs as partners\nof the said firm. Consequently, in view of the admitted fact\nthat the partnership firm stands dissolved upon the death of\nthe original partners, the Plaintiffs could not have maintained\nthe present Suit in law.\n\n80. This is also because, if the Plaintiffs do not claim through the\nFirm, they do not obtain any right to sue. Hence, it is done\nonly with the reason to\n\n81. Moreover, the principle\nlaid down by\nthe Hon'ble Gujarat\nHigh Court in\nPathik Udayan Bhatt v. Sakti Infotech and\nOthers\n, 2024 SCC OnLine Guj 4221, applies in the present\ncase.\n\n\"21.

Therefore also, as there are no averments in the Plaint that the\nsuit is filed by the firm which has been registered under the\n\nPartnership Act\n, the plaint ought to have been rejected by the\ntrial Court even on this count.\n\n83. Therefore, in the absence of any averment in the Plaint to the\neffect that the Suit has been instituted by a firm duly\nregistered under the provisions of the\nIndian Partnership Act,\n, the Suit is rendered not maintainable in law.

In the present case, the principal and substantive relief sought\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

The relief relating to protection\nof possession over the suit property, as pleaded in the Plaint,\nis merely incidental or ancillary to the claim for specific\nperformance. Once it is held that the primary relief for\nspecific performance is barred by limitation, any\nconsequential or ancillary relief which is dependent upon the\nsuccess of that principal claim cannot independently survive.\nThe law is well settled that where the main relief is barred,\nthe ancillary or consequential relief automatically falls.\n\n85. It further appears from the record that the Plaintiff seeks to\nprotect his possession over the suit property by invoking the\ndoctrine of part performance under\nSection 53A\nof the\nTransfer of Property Act, 1882. The Plaintiff's case is that\npossession was handed over to him pursuant to the\nsupplementary agreement dated 19.12.1983, and therefore,\nhis continued possession deserves protection. However,\n\nSection 53A\nof the Transfer of Property Act does not confer\nownership or any enforceable title; it merely protects the\npossession of a transferee who has acted in part performance\nof a contract.\n\n86.

The Plaintiff,\ntherefore, cannot rely on Section 53A to found a cause of\naction for enforcement of any contractual right.\n\n87. This is for a simple reason. If the Plaintiff is seeking a relief\nof protection of possession on the strength of an Agreement\nto Sell, it is claiming the benefit by operation of\nSection 53A\n\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (\"\nTP Act\n\"). However,\nthe benefit of\nSection 53A\nof the TP Act is not available to an\nUnregistered Agreement to sell holder. Albeit it is true that\nsince the document has been executed before 2001, according\nto Section 17A the same is not required to be registered.\n\n88. In light of the above settled position, the Plaintiff's reliance\non\nSection 53A\nof the Transfer of Property Act to sustain his\nclaim or protect his possession is legally untenable. Once the\nprimary claim for specific performance is barred by\nlimitation, the ancillary plea for protection of possession\nunder Section 53A must also fail.\n\n89. The Plaintiffs however, have tried to come out of the rigours\nof\nsection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act, by stating that\nsince there are other reliefs regarding protection possession of\nthe suit property.

It is pertinent to note that when the main relief of specific\nperformance is not available to the Plaintiff on account of\nnon-disclosure and non-existence of cause of action, for the\nsame, the consequential relief of injunction cannot be said to\nbe available to the Plaintiff on similar count. Therefore, when\nthe relief of injunction is not an independent relief, there is no\nquestion of rejection of the Plaint, since the main relief itself\nis not maintainable in the present case.\n\n91.

Therefore,\nonce the Plaintiff has failed to get any substantive\nrelief of cancellation of the sale deed and failed to\nget any declaratory relief, and as observed\nhereinabove, relief of injunction can be said to be a\nconsequential relief. Therefore, the prayer for\npermanent injunction must fail. In the instant case\nas the Plaintiff cannot be said to be in lawful\npossession of the suit land, i.e., the possession of the\nPlaintiff is \"not legal or authorised by the law\", the\nPlaintiff shall not be entitled to any permanent\ninjunction.\n\n11.1 An injunction is a consequential relief and in a\nsuit for declaration with a consequential relief of\ninjunction, it is not a suit for declaration simpliciter,\nit is a suit for declaration with a further relief.\n\nWhether the further relief claimed has, in a\nparticular case as consequential upon a declaration\nis adequate must always depend upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. Where once a suit is\nheld not maintainable, no relief of injunction can\nbe granted.

Learned Senior Advocate for the Plaintiff has also placed\nreliance on the judgment reported in 2021 SCC OnLine Guj\n3285 in the case of\nBardoli Shreerang Exhibitors Private\nLimited v. Maheshbhai Babubhai Hirapara\n, wherein the\nHon'ble Court held that when there is a specific case pleaded\nby the Plaintiff that he became aware of the impugned deeds\nonly upon the filing of the Written Statement in the earlier\nSuit, then, though such averment may or may not ultimately\nbe proved, the issue of limitation cannot, at the threshold, be\npressed against the Plaintiff.\n\n95. However, in the present case, the Plaintiffs are asserting\nrights as alleged partners of the dissolved firm Tirupati\nCorporation and are seeking to derive title and possession on\nthe strength of agreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983.\nIt is an admitted position that the original partners of Tirupati\nCorporation had already asserted their alleged rights under\nthe same agreements, and even at that point of time, they had\nnot sought specific performance. The Civil Suit No. 1435 of\n2003 filed by the partnership firm was only for injunction,\nand no relief for specific performance was claimed.

With respect to the judgment relied upon by the learned\nSenior Advocate for the Plaintiff in the case of Shiv\nDevelopers through its\nPartner Sunilbhai Somabhai Ajmeri\nv. Aksharay Developers and Others\n, the same will not be\napplicable to the facts of the present case. The Suit filed by\nthe Plaintiff is for enforcement of rights arising from a\ncontract and not based on any allegation of fraud or\nmisrepresentation.\n\nIn\nShive Developers\n(supra), the Court was\ndealing with a situation where the Suit was grounded on\nallegations of fraud, concealment and deceit, which is not the\nposition in the present matter. The Plaintiff's claim is purely\ncontractual and, therefore\n,\nthe said decision\ndoes not assist\nthe Plaintiff.\n\n97. The judgment relied upon in the case of Daliben Valjibhai\nand Others v. Prajapati Kodarbhai Kacharabhai and\nAnother is also not applicable. In that case, the Plaintiff had\nspecifically contended that she became aware of the\nimpugned sale deed only in the year 2004, and it was her case\nthat the document contained forged signatures and thumb\nimpressions. The issue there related to the computation of\nlimitation in cases involving fraud under\nSection 17\nof the\nLimitation Act. In the present case, however, the erstwhile\npartners of Tirupati Corporation were fully aware of the\nagreements dated 15.12.1983 and 19.12.1983 and had even\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Therefore, the Plaintiffs, claiming through\nthe same partners, cannot assert lack of knowledge. The right\nto sue arose much earlier, and the Suit filed in 2020 is clearly\nbarred by limitation.\n\n98. Reliance placed on\nP. Kumarakurubaran v. P. Narayanan\nand Others\nis also misplaced. The said case concerned a\nchallenge to a General Power of Attorney alleged to have\nbeen fraudulently executed. The Court examined limitation in\nthat factual background. In the present case, the original\nowner, Defendant No. 4, was not a signatory to the\nagreements entered into between Defendant No. 3 and the\npartnership firm in 1983. The erstwhile partners never sought\nspecific performance of those agreements despite being aware\nof the refusal of Defendant No. 4. The record shows that the\npartners had knowledge of such refusal at least since the year\n2003. Therefore\n,\nthe said judgment\ndoes not assist the\nPlaintiffs.\n\n99. As regards reliance on Vinod Infra Developers Ltd. v.\n\nMahavir Lunia and Others, where the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt held that a plaint can only be rejected if it is manifestly\nvexatious or discloses no cause of action, the principle does\nnot help the Plaintiffs.

Both causes of action are barred by\nlimitation. The registered sale deeds of 2003 and 2008 are\npublic documents, and the Plaintiffs are deemed to have\nknowledge of their execution. The sale deed of 14.11.2008\nwas executed by Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 in their capacity as\npartners of Tirupati Corporation, which imputes constructive\nnotice to the Plaintiffs. Similarly, the sale deed executed by\nDefendant No. 4 in favour of Defendant No. 5 in 1983 was a\nregistered document, creating deemed knowledge under law.\nTherefore, the Plaintiffs cannot claim ignorance or a fresh\ncause of action. The Suit is clearly barred by limitation under\n\nArticle 59\nof the\nLimitation Act\nand discloses no existing\nright to sue.\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\n100. Upon careful consideration of the pleadings, documents, and\nreliefs sought in the Plaint, this Court finds that the Suit\nsuffers from fundamental legal infirmities and discloses no\ngenuine cause of action. The summary reasoning for the same\nmay be set out as follows:\n\n101. Firstly, the Suit is based on agreements dated 15.12.1983 and\n19.12.1983, which were entered into not with the Plaintiffs in\ntheir individual capacity but with the partnership firm\nTirupati Corporation. The Plaintiffs, however, have sought\nspecific performance of those agreements in their personal\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\nfavour. Such a pleading reflects an inherent inconsistency.\nThe Plaintiffs cannot claim rights under agreements executed\nwith the firm and simultaneously sue in their own names.\nThis conduct amounts to clear approbation and reprobation\nseeking to rely on the firm when it suits their purpose and to\ndisown its existence to avoid the statutory bar under\nSection\nof the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Such mutually\ndestructive pleas cannot stand together and render the cause\nof action wholly illusory.\n\n102. Secondly, the partnership firm Tirupati Corporation stood\ndissolved upon the death of its two partners, in terms of\n\nSection 42(c)\nof the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Once the\nfirm was dissolved, no legal relationship survived between\nthe erstwhile partners, nor could any rights or liabilities be\nenforced in the name of the firm. The Plaintiffs, claiming\nthrough the deceased partners, cannot maintain a Suit on\nbehalf of a non-existent entity or claim personal reliefs\nflowing from contracts executed in its name.\n\n103. Thirdly, even assuming the agreements to be validly\nexecuted, the Suit is hopelessly barred by limitation under\n\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act\n. The right to seek specific\nperformance accrued in 1983 when the agreements were\nexecuted, and, at the latest, in 2003 when the erstwhile\npartners filed Civil Suit No. 1435 of 2003 without seeking\nsuch relief. The subsequent sale deeds executed in 2003 and\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/CRA/11/2023 JUDGMENT DATED: 15/10/2025\n\nundefined\n\n2008 are registered public documents, and the Plaintiffs are\ndeemed to have had constructive notice of their execution.\nHence, the plea of lack of knowledge or recent discovery is\nuntenable.\n\n104. Fourthly, the Suit is expressly barred under\nSection 69(1)\n\nand (2) of the\nIndian Partnership Act, 1932\n, since the\npartnership firm was unregistered and the Plaintiffs are not\nshown in the Register of Firms as partners. The statutory bar\nis absolute and goes to the root of the maintainability of the\nSuit.\n\n105. Fifthly, the cause of action, as pleaded, is artificial and\nillusory. The Plaintiffs have attempted to resurrect stale and\nextinguished rights (that too of the dissolved firm) through\nvague averments. The Suit, therefore, represents a clear\ninstance of an illusory cause of action. Allowing such a Suit\nto proceed would amount to permitting abuse of the judicial\nprocess.\n\n106. In view of the above, this Court finds that the Plaint is devoid\nof merit and discloses no legally enforceable right. The Suit\nis barred both by limitation and by the provisions of\nSection\nof the Partnership Act, 1932. The cause of action being\nillusory and inconsistent, the Plaint deserves to be rejected at\nthe threshold under Order VII Rule 11(a) and (d)\nof the Code\nof Civil Procedure\n.\nUploaded by MANOJ KR.

Accordingly, the Civil Revision Application is allowed. The\nimpugned order passed by the Learned Trial Court below\nExhibit 80 is quashed and set aside. The application under\nOrder VII Rule 11 is allowed, and the Plaint in Civil Suit No.\n220 of 2020 stands rejected. No order as to costs.\n\n(SANJEEV J.THAKER,J)\n\nManoj Kumar Rai\nUploaded by MANOJ KR. RAI(HC01072) on Thu Oct 16 2025 Downloaded on : Fri Oct 17 02:28:11 IST 2025",
