No.50855/2021\n Mahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nGwalior, Dated: 09-11-2021\n\n Shri Anoop Kumar Gupta, Advocate for applicants.\n\n Shri BPS Chauhan, Public Prosecutor for respondent\n\nno.1/State.\n\n This application under \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C. has been filed for\n\nquashing the FIR in Crime No.54/2018 registered at Police Station\n\nGormi, District Bhind as well as for quashing the further proceedings\n\nin RCT No.290/2018 pending in the Court of JMFC, Mehgaon,\n\nDistrict Bhind.\n\n2. It appears that the applicants are facing trial for offence under\n\nSection 4\n of Dowry Prohibition Act. The complainant lodged an FIR\n\non 22/2/2018 alleging that on 16/6/2017 the engagement of his\n\ndaughter took place with applicant no.4, but since the complainant\n\nwas not in a position to fulfill the dowry demand of the applicants,\n\ntherefore, the marriage was cancelled. It was alleged that the\n\napplicant no.4 was in government job and at the time of settlement of\n\nmarriage, the applicant had demanded Rs.5,00,000/- in cash as well\n\nas one bullet motorcycle, apart from other household articles and the\n\ncomplainant had agreed to give the same. The engagement was\n\nsolemnized on 16/6/2017 by exchanging rings in the Pavai Mata\n\nTemple. On 26/6/2017 God Bharai rituals were fulfilled and a gold\n\nring of Rs.15,000/- was given to applicant no.4, whereas the\n\n 2\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\n Mahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\napplicants gave a pair of silver nose ring, Salvar suit as well as\n\nSarees to his daughter. The complainant had also given an amount of\n\nRs.51,000/- in cash and Rs.2,100/- alongwith the clothes to the\n\nfamily members of the applicant at the time of Vidai. Subh Muhurt\n\nfor the marriage of the daughter of the applicant was 5/7/2018 and\n\naccordingly, an invitation in the form of Peeli Chitthi was sent to the\n\napplicants on 16/1/2018 through his son, but the applicants did not\n\naccept the Peeli Chitthi and insisted that a swift car, gold ornaments\n\nof 10 tola to the bride as well as an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- be given\n\nin cash. Further, it was said that in case if the complainant is ready to\n\ngive the aforesaid articles and money, then he should resend the Peeli\n\nChitthi, otherwise they would get applicant no.4 married to\n\nsomebody else. Since the complainant was not in a position to give a\n\nswift car, cash amount of Rs.5,00,000/- and gold jewelry of 10 tolas,\n\ntherefore, the applicants have broken the marriage, as a result, the\n\ncomplainant and his daughter have been defamed in the society.\n\n3. Challenging the FIR as well as the criminal prosecution it is\n\nsubmitted by the counsel for the applicant that although all the\n\nwitnesses in their ocular statements have repeated the allegations\n\nmade in the FIR, but their ocular statements are contrary to the Peeli\n\nChitthi which was seized and is a part of the charge-sheet. It is\n\nsubmitted that from the Peeli Chitthi it is clear that it was not meant\n\n 3\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\n Mahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nfor the applicant no.4 as well as the daughter of the complainant and\n\nwhen the ocular statements are not supported by documentary\n\nstatements, then the ocular statements should be disbelived and the\n\ncharge-sheet should be quashed. In support of his contentions, the\n\ncounsel for the applicant has relied upon the judgment passed by the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd.\n\nVs. State of Maharasthra and others reported in SCC OnLine SC\n\n315.\n\n4. Per contra, the application is vehemently opposed by the\n\ncounsel for the State. It is submitted that while exercising the power\n\nunder \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C. High Court cannot appreciate the\n\nevidence and the power can be exercised only when no offence is\n\nmade out, even if the entire allegations made against the accused are\n\naccepted in toto.\n\n5. Heard learned counsel for the partis.\n\n6. The solitary argument of the applicant is that since the Peeli\n\nChitthi which has been filed alongwith the charge-sheet does not\n\nrelate to the applicant no.4 and the daughter of the complainant,\n\ntherefore, the allegations made in the FIR as well as ocular\n\nstatements of the witnesses must be disbelieved. The Supreme Court\n\nin the case of M/s Neeharika Infrastructure (supra) has held as\n\n 4\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\n Mahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nunder:-\n\n 34. While considering the aforesaid issue, law on the\n exercise of powers by the High Court under Section\n 482 Cr.P.C. and/or under Article 226 of the Constitution\n of India to quash the FIR/complaint and the parameters\n for exercise of such powers and scope and ambit of the\n power by the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India are\n required to be referred to as the very parameters which\n are required to be applied while quashing the FIR will\n also be applicable while granting interim\n stay/protection.\n\n 35. The first case on the point which is required to be\n noticed is the decision of this Court in the case of R.P.\n Kapur (supra). While dealing with the inherent powers\n of the High Court under Section 561-A of the earlier\n Code (which is pari materia with Section 482 of the\n Code), it is observed and held that the inherent powers\n of the High Court under Section 561 of the earlier Code\n cannot be exercised in regard to the matters specifically\n covered by the other provisions of the Code; the\n inherent jurisdiction of the High Court can be exercised\n to quash proceedings in a proper case either to prevent\n the abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to\n secure the ends of justice; ordinarily criminal\n proceedings instituted against an accused person must\n be tried under the provisions of the Code, and the High\n Court would be reluctant to interfere with the said\n proceedings at an interlocutory stage. After observing\n this, thereafter this Court then carved out some\n exceptions to the above-stated rule, which are as under:\n\n \"(i) Where it manifestly appears that there is a legal\n bar against the institution or continuance of the\n criminal proceeding in respect of the offence alleged.\n\n Absence of\n the requisite sanction may, for instance, furnish cases\n under this category.\n\n (ii) Where the allegations in the first information\n report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their\n face value and accepted in their entirety, do not\n constitute the offence alleged; in such cases no\n\n 5\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n question of appreciating evidence arises; it is a\n matter merely of looking at the complaint or the first\n information report to decide whether the offence\n alleged is disclosed or not.\n\n (iii) Where the allegations made against the accused\n person do constitute an offence alleged but there is\n either no legal evidence adduced in support of the\n case or the evidence adduced clearly or manifestly\n fails to prove the charge. In dealing with this class of\n cases it is important to bear in mind the distinction\n between a case where there is no legal evidence or\n where there is evidence which is manifestly and\n clearly inconsistent with the accusation made and\n cases where there is legal\n evidence which on its appreciation may or may not\n support the accusation in question. In exercising its\n jurisdiction under Section 561-A the High Court\n would not embark upon an enquiry as to whether the\n evidence in question is reliable or not. That is the\n function of the trial Magistrate, and ordinarily it\n would not be open to any party to invoke the High\n Court's inherent jurisdiction and contend that on a\n reasonable appreciation of the evidence the\n accusation made against the accused would not be\n sustained.\"\n\n 36. In the case of Kurukshetra University (supra), this\n Court observed and held that inherent powers under\n \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. do not confer an arbitrary\n jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim\n or caprice; that statutory power has to be exercised\n sparingly with circumspection and in the rarest of rare\n cases. In the case before this Court, the High Court\n quashed the first information report filed by the\n Kurukshetra University through Warden and that too\n without issuing notice to the University, in exercise of\n inherent powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. This Court\n noticed and observed that the High Court was not\n justified in quashing the FIR when thepolice had not\n even commenced investigation into the complaint filed\n by the Warden of the University and no proceedings\n were at all pending before any Court in pursuance of\n the FIR.\n\n 6\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n 37. Then comes the celebrated decision of this Court in\n the case of Bhajan Lal (supra). In the said decision, this\n Court considered in detail the scope of the High Court\n powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or \nArticle 226\n of\n the Constitution of India to quash the FIR and referred\n to several judicial precedents and held that the High\n Court should not embark upon an inquiry into the\n merits and demerits of the allegations and quash the\n proceedings without allowing the investigating agency\n to complete its task. At the same time, this Court\n identified the following cases in which FIR/complaint\n can be quashed:\n\n \"102.(1) Where the allegations made in the first\n information report or the complaint, even if they are\n taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety\n do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out\n a case against the accused.\n\n (2) Where the allegations in the first information\n report and other materials, if any, accompanying the\n FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying\n an investigation by police officers under Section\n 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a\n Magistrate within the purview of Section 155(2) of\n the Code.\n\n (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the\n FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in\n support of the same do not disclose the commission\n of any offence and make out a case against the\n accused.\n\n (4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute\n a cognizable offence but constitute only a non-\n\n cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a\n police officer without an order of a Magistrate as\n contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code.\n (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or\n complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable\n on the basis of which no prudent person can ever\n reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground\n for proceeding against the accused.\n\n (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in\n any of the provisions of the Code or the Act\n concerned (under which a criminal proceeding is\n\n 7\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n instituted) to the institution and continuance of the\n proceedings and/or where there is a specific\n provision in the Code or the Act concerned,\n providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the\n aggrieved party.\n\n (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\n attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding\n is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for\n wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view\n to spite him due to private and personal grudge.\"\n\n 38. In the case of Golconda Lingaswamy (supra), after\n considering the decisions of this Court in the cases of\n R.P. Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra) and other\n decisions on the exercise of inherent powers by the\n High Court under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., in paragraphs 5,\n 7 and 8, it is observed and held as under:\n\n \"5. Exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code in\n a case of this nature is the exception and not the rule.\n The section does not confer any new powers on the\n High Court. It only saves the inherent power which the\n Court possessed before the enactment of the Code. It\n envisages three circumstances under which the inherent\n jurisdiction may be exercised, namely : (i) to give effect\n to an order under the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of the\n process of court, and (iii) to otherwise secure the ends\n of justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to lay\n down any inflexible rule which would govern the\n exercise of inherent jurisdiction. No legislative\n enactment dealing with procedure can provide for all\n cases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have\n inherent powers apart from express provisions of law\n which are necessary for proper discharge of functions\n and duties imposed upon them by law. That is the\n doctrine which finds expression in the section which\n merely recognises and preserves inherent powers of the\n High Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal,\n possess in the absence of any express provision, as\n inherent in their constitution, all such powers as are\n necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course\n of administration of justice on the principle quando lex\n aliquid alique concedit, conceditur et id sine quo res\n ipsa esse non potest (when the law gives a person\n\n 8\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n anything, it gives him that without which it cannot\n exist). While exercising powers under the section, the\n Court does not function as a court of appeal or revision.\n\n Inherent jurisdiction under the section though wide has\n to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with caution\n and only when such exercise is justified by the tests\n specifically laid down in the section itself. It is to be\n exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and substantial\n justice for the administration of which alone courts\n exist. Authority of the court exists for advancement of\n justice and if any attempt is made to abuse that\n authority so as to produce injustice, the court has power\n to prevent such abuse. It would be an abuse of the\n process of the court to allow any action which would\n result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In\n exercise of the powers court would be justified to quash\n any proceeding if it finds that initiation or continuance\n of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or\n quashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve\n the ends of justice. When no offence is disclosed by the\n complaint, the court may examine the question of fact.\n When a complaint is sought to be quashed, it is\n permissible to look into the materials to assess what the\n complainant has alleged and whether any offence is\n made out even if the allegations are accepted in toto.\n\n 7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to\n bear in mind the distinction between a case where there\n is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is\n clearly inconsistent with the accusations made, and a\n case where there is legal evidence which, on\n appreciation, may or may not support the accusations.\n When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the\n Code, the High Court would not ordinarily embark\n upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question is\n reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation\n of it accusation would not be sustained. That is the\n function of the trial Judge. Judicial process, no doubt\n should not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless\n harassment. Court should be circumspect and judicious\n in exercising discretion and should take all relevant\n facts and circumstances into consideration before\n issuing process, lest it would be an instrument in the\n hands of a private complainant to unleash vendetta to\n\n 9\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n harass any person needlessly. At the same time the\n section is not an instrument handed over to an accused\n to short-circuit a prosecution and bring about its sudden\n death..\n\n 8. As noted above, the powers possessed by the High\n Court under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and\n the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in\n its exercise. Court must be careful to see that its\n decision in exercise of this power is based on sound\n principles. The inherent power should not be exercised\n to stifle a legitimate prosecution. High Court being the\n highest court of a State should normally refrain from\n giving a prima facie decision in a case where the entire\n facts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the\n evidence has not been collected and produced before\n the Court and the issues involved, whether factual or\n legal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true\n perspective without sufficient material. Of course, no\n hard-and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in\n which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary\n jurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any stage.\n \n[See \nJanata Dal v. H.S. Chowdhary\n [(1992) 4 SCC\n 305 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 36 : (1992) 4 SCC 305 : AIR\n 1993 SC 892] and Raghubir Saran (Dr.) v. State of\n Bihar [AIR 1964 SC 1 : (1964) 1 Cri LJ 1].] It would\n not be proper for the High Court to analyse the case of\n the complainant in the light of all probabilities in order\n to determine whether a conviction would be sustainable\n and on such premises, arrive at a conclusion that the\n proceedings are to be quashed. It would be erroneous to\n assess the material before it and conclude that the\n complaint cannot be proceeded with. In a proceeding\n instituted on complaint, exercise of the inherent powers\n to quash the proceedings is called for only in a case\n where the complaint does not disclose any offence or is\n frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the allegations set\n out in the complaint do not constitute the offence of\n which cognisance has been taken by the Magistrate, it is\n open to the High Court to quash the same in exercise of\n the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code.

If it appears\n that on consideration of the allegations in the light of\n the statement made on oath of the complainant or\n disclosed in the FIR that the ingredients of the offence\n or offences are disclosed and there is no material to\n show that the complaint/FIR is mala fide, frivolous or\n vexatious, in that event there would be no justification\n for interference by the High Court. When an\n information is lodged at the police station and an\n offence is registered, then the mala fides of the\n informant would be of secondary importance. It is the\n material collected during the investigation and evidence\n led in court which decides the fate of the accused\n person. The allegations of mala fides against the\n informant are of no consequence and cannot by\n themselves be the basis for quashing the proceeding.\"\n\n 39. In the case of Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd.\n (supra), in paragraph 11, this Court has observed and\n held as under:\n\n \"11. ... the powers possessed by the High Court under\n Section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very\n plenitude of the power requires great caution in its\n exercise.

In the case of Sanapareddy Maheedhar Seshagiri\n (supra), in paragraph 31, it is observed and held as\n under:\n\n \"31. A careful reading of the abovenoted judgments\n makes it clear that the High Court should be\n extremely cautious and slow to interfere with the\n investigation and/or trial of criminal cases and\n should not stall the investigation and/or prosecution\n except when it is convinced beyond any manner of\n doubt that FIR does not disclose commission of any\n offence or that the allegations contained in FIR do\n not constitute any cognizable offence or that the\n prosecution is barred by law or the High Court is\n convinced that it is necessary to interfere to prevent\n\n 12\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n abuse of the process of the Court. In dealing with\n such cases, the High Court has to bear in mind that\n judicial intervention at the threshold of the legal\n process initiated against a person accused of\n committing offence is highly detrimental to the\n larger public and societal interest. The people and\n the society have a legitimate expectation that those\n committing offences either against an individual or\n the society are expeditiously brought to trial and, if\n found guilty, adequately punished. Therefore, while\n deciding a petition filed for quashing FIR or\n complaint or restraining the competent authority\n from investigating the allegations contained in FIR\n or complaint or for stalling the trial of the case, the\n High Court should be extremely careful and\n circumspect. If the allegations contained in FIR or\n complaint disclose commission of some crime, then\n the High Court must keep its hands off and allow\n the investigating agency to complete the\n investigation without any fetter and also refrain\n from passing order which may impede the trial. The\n High Court should not go into the merits and\n demerits of the allegations simply because the\n petitioner alleges malus animus against the author\n of FIR or the complainant. The High Court must\n also refrain from making imaginary journey in the\n realm of possible harassment which may be caused\n to the petitioner on account of investigation of FIR\n or complaint. Such a course will result in\n miscarriage of justice and would encourage those\n accused of committing crimes to repeat the same.\n However, if the High Court is satisfied that the\n complaint does not disclose commission of any\n offence or prosecution is barred by limitation or that\n the proceedings of criminal case would result in\n failure of justice, then it may exercise inherent\n power under \nSection 482\n CrPC.\"\n\n 41. In the case of Arun Gulab Gawali (supra), this\n Court set aside the order passed by the High Court\n quashing the criminal complaint/FIR which was even\n filed by the complainant. In the case before this Court,\n prayer for quashing the FIR before the High Court was\n\n 13\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs.

Quashing and setting aside the\n judgment and order passed by the High Court quashing\n the FIR, this Court in paragraphs 13 and 27 to 29 has\n observed as under:\n\n \n\"13. The power of quashing criminal proceedings\n has to be exercised very sparingly and with\n circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare\n cases and the Court cannot be justified in\n embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or\n genuineness or otherwise of allegations made in the\n FIR/complaint, unless the allegations are so patently\n absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent\n person can ever reach such a conclusion. The\n extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do\n not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to\n act according to its whims or caprice. However, the\n Court, under its inherent powers, can neither\n intervene at an uncalled for stage nor can it \"soft-\n pedal the course of justice\" at a crucial stage of\n investigation/proceedings. The provisions of\n \nArticles 226\n, 227\n of the Constitution of India and\n \nSection 482\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n 1973 (hereinafter called as \"\nCrPC\n\") are a device to\n advance justice and not to frustrate it. The power of\n judicial review is discretionary, however, it must be\n exercised to prevent the miscarriage of justice and\n for correcting some grave errors and to ensure that\n stream of administration of justice remains clean\n and pure. However, there are no limits of power of\n the Court, but the more the power, the more due\n care and caution is to be exercised in invoking these\n powers. (\nVide State of W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha\n\n [(1982) 1 SCC 561 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 283 : (1982) 1\n SCC 561 : \nAIR 1982 SC 949], Pepsi Foods Ltd. v.\n Special Judicial Magistrate\n [(1998) 5 SCC 749 :\n\n 1998 SCC (Cri) 1400], G.

No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n that as the complainant himself was not supporting\n the complaint, he would not support the case of the\n prosecution and there would be no chance of\n conviction, thus the trial itself would be a futile\n exercise. Quashing of FIR/complaint on such a\n ground cannot be held to be justified in law.\n\n Ordinarily, the Court of Session is empowered to\n discharge an accused under \nSection 227\n CrPC even\n before initiating the trial. The accused can,\n therefore, move the trial court itself for such a relief\n and the trial court would be in a better position to\n analyse and pass an order as it is possessed of all\n the powers and the material to do so. It is, therefore,\n not necessary to invoke the jurisdiction under\n \nSection 482\n CrPC for the quashing of a prosecution\n in such a case. The reliance on affidavits by the\n High Court would be a weak, hazy and unreliable\n source for adjudication on the fate of a trial. The\n presumption that an accused would never be\n convicted on the material available is too risky a\n proposition to be accepted readily, particularly in\n heinous offences like extortion.\n\n 28. A claim founded on a denial by the complainant\n even before the trial commences coupled with an\n allegation that the police had compelled the lodging\n of a false FIR, is a matter which requires further\n investigation as the charge is levelled against the\n police. If the prosecution is quashed, then neither\n the trial court nor the investigating agency has any\n opportunity to go into this question, which may\n require consideration. The State is the prosecutor\n and all prosecution is the social and legal\n responsibility of the State. An offence committed is\n a crime against society and not against the victim\n alone. The victim under undue pressure or influence\n of the accused or under any threat or compulsion\n may resile back but that would not absolve the State\n from bringing the accused to book, who has\n committed an offence and has violated the law of\n the land.\n\n 29. Thus, while exercising such power the Court has\n to act cautiously before proceeding to quash a\n prosecution in respect of an offence which hits and\n\n 15\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n affects the society at large. It should be a case where\n no other view is possible nor any investigation or\n inquiry is further required. There cannot be a\n general proposition of law, so as to fit in as a\n straitjacket formula for the exercise of such power.\n Each case will have to be judged on its own merit\n and the facts warranting exercise of such power.\n More so, it was not a case of civil nature where\n there could be a possibility of compromise or\n involving an offence which may be compoundable\n under \nSection 320\n CrPC, where the Court could\n apply the ratio of Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia\n [(1988) 1 SCC 692 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 234 : (1988) 1\n SCC 692 : AIR 1988 SC 709].\"\n\n 42. Thereafter in catena of decisions, this Court has\n reiterated the parameters for exercise of inherent\n powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle\n 226\n of the Constitution of India in the matter of\n quashing the FIR/complaint.\n\n 51. \nIn the case of \nUjjal Kumar Burdhan\n (supra), it is\n observed and held by this Court that unless case of\n gross abuse of power is made out against those in\n charge of investigation, the High Court should be loath\n to interfere at early/premature stage of investigation.\n\n 52. \nIn the case of \nSatvinder Kaur v. State (Govt. of NCT\n of Delhi\n), (1999) 8 SCC 728, in paragraphs 14 to 16, it\n is observed and held as under:\n\n \n\"14. Further, the legal position is well settled that if\n an offence is disclosed the court will not normally\n interfere with an investigation into the case and will\n permit investigation into the offence alleged to be\n completed. If the FIR, prima facie, discloses the\n commission of an offence, the court does not\n normally stop the investigation, for, to do so would\n be to trench upon the lawful power of the police to\n investigate into cognizable offences. [\nState of W.B.\n v. Swapan Kumar Guha\n, (1982) 1 SCC 561 : 1982\n SCC (Cri) 283] It is also settled by a long course of\n decisions of this Court that for the purpose of\n exercising its power under \nSection 482\n CrPC to\n quash an FIR or a complaint, the High Court would\n have to proceed entirely on the basis of the\n\n 16\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\nMahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n allegations made in the complaint or the documents\n accompanying the same per se; it has no jurisdiction\n to examine the correctness or otherwise of the\n allegations.\n \n[\nPratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar\n, (1985)\n 2 SCC 370, 395 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 180]\n\n 15. Hence, in the present case, the High Court\n committed a grave error in accepting the contention\n of the respondent that the investigating officer had\n no jurisdiction to investigate the matters on the\n alleged ground that no part of the offence was\n committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the\n police station at Delhi. The appreciation of the\n evidence is the function of the courts when seized\n of the matter. At the stage of investigation, the\n material collected by an investigating officer cannot\n be judicially scrutinized for arriving at a conclusion\n that the police station officer of a particular police\n station would not have territorial jurisdiction. In\n any case, it has to be stated that in view of \nSection\n 178(c)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code, when it is\n uncertain in which of the several local areas an\n offence was committed, or where it consists of\n several acts done in different local areas, the said\n offence can be enquired into or tried by a court\n having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.\n Therefore, to say at the stage of investigation that\n the SHO, Police Station Paschim Vihar, New Delhi\n was not having territorial jurisdiction, is on the face\n of it, illegal and erroneous. That apart, Section\n 156(2) contains an embargo that no proceeding of a\n police officer shall be challenged on the ground that\n he has no territorial power to investigate. The High\n Court has completely overlooked the said embargo\n when it entertained the petition of Respondent 2 on\n the ground of want of territorial jurisdiction.\n\n \n16. Lastly, it is required to be reiterated that while\n exercising the jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of the\n Criminal Procedure Code of quashing an\n investigation, the court should bear in mind what\n has been observed in the \nState of Kerala v. O.C.\n Kuttan\n [(1999) 2 SCC 651 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 304 :\n\n JT (1999) 1 SC 486] to the following effect : (SCC\n pp. 654-55, para 6) \"Having said so, the Court gave\n\n 17\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\n Mahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n a note of caution to the effect that the power of\n quashing the criminal proceedings should be\n exercised very sparingly with circumspection and\n that too in the rarest of rare cases; that the court will\n not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to\n the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the\n allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and\n that the extraordinary or inherent powers do not\n confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act\n according to its whim or caprice. It is too well\n settled that the first information report is only an\n initiation to move the machinery and to investigate\n into a cognizable offence and, therefore, while\n exercising the power and deciding\n whether the investigation itself should be quashed,\n utmost care should be taken by the court and at that\n stage, it is not possible for the court to sift the\n materials or to weigh the materials and then come to\n the conclusion one way or the other. \nIn the case of\n \nState of U.P. v. O.P. Sharma\n [(1996) 7 SCC 705 :\n 1996 SCC (Cri) 497 : JT (1996) 2 SC 488] a three-\n Judge Bench of this Court indicated that the High\n Court should be loath to interfere at the threshold to\n thwart the prosecution exercising its inherent power\n under Section 482 or under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of\n the Constitution of India, as the case may be, and\n allow the law to take its own course.\n \nThe same view\n was reiterated by yet another three-Judge Bench of\n this Court in the case of \nRashmi Kumar v. Mahesh\n Kumar Bhada\n [(1997) 2 SCC 397 : 1997 SCC (Cri)\n 415 : JT (1996) 11 SC 175] where this Court\n sounded a word of caution and stated that such\n power should be sparingly and cautiously exercised\n only when the court is of the opinion that otherwise\n there will be gross miscarriage of justice. The Court\n had also observed that social stability and order is\n required to be regulated by proceeding against the\n offender as it is an offence against society as a\n whole.\"\n\n7. Thus, it is clear that this Court while exercising power under\n\nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C. cannot look into the reliability and credibility\n\n 18\n\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C. No.50855/2021\n\n Mahavir Singh and others Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n of the evidence relied upon by the prosecution.\n\n 8. In the present case, it is not the case of the applicants that they\n\n were ready to marry the daughter of the complainant. The only\n\n contention of the counsel for the applicants is that since the Peeli\n\n Chitthi was not meant for the applicant no.4 and the daughter of the\n\n complainant, therefore, the allegations of breaking the marriage on\n\n account of additional demand cannot be relied upon, is beyond the\n\n scope of power under \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C. Whether the ocular\n\n statement is to be believed or the Peeli Chitthi is to be believed or\n\n discarded, is a matter which is to be considered and decided by the\n\n Trial Court after recording the evidence.\n\n 9. As the allegations made in the FIR make out a prima facie case\n\n warranting prosecution of the applicants, accordingly, the application\n\n under \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR in Crime\n\n No.54/2018 registered at Police Station Gormi, District Bhind as well\n\n as for quashing the further proceedings in RCT No.290/2018 pending\n\n in the Court of JMFC, Mehgaon, District Bhind fails and is hereby\n\n dismissed.\n\n (G.S.

The appreciation of the\n evidence is the function of the courts when seized\n of the matter. At the stage of investigation, the\n material collected by an investigating officer cannot\n be judicially scrutinized for arriving at a conclusion\n that the police station officer of a particular police\n station would not have territorial jurisdiction. In\n any case, it has to be stated that in view of \nSection\n 178(c)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code, when it is\n uncertain in which of the several local areas an\n offence was committed, or where it consists of\n several acts done in different local areas, the said\n offence can be enquired into or tried by a court\n having jurisdiction over any of such local areas.\n Therefore, to say at the stage of investigation that\n the SHO, Police Station Paschim Vihar, New Delhi\n was not having territorial jurisdiction, is on the face\n of it, illegal and erroneous.
