Amgoth Anitha Nayak on 9 October, 2023\n\nAuthor:\nG.Radha Rani\n\nBench:\nG.Radha Rani\n\nTHE HONOURABLE DR.JUSTICE G.RADHA RANI\n\nCIVIL REVISION PETITION NO.1769 of 2023\n\nO R D E R:\n\nThis Civil Revision Petition is filed by the petitioner - plaintiff aggrieved\n\nby the order and decree passed by the Principal District Judge, Hanumakonda in\n\nI.A.No.630 of 2023 in O.S.No.188 of 2022 (Old O.S.No.99 of 2016) dated\n\n15.06.2023.\n\n2. The brief facts of the case are that the plaintiff filed a suit for specific\n\nperformance of agreement of sale dated 31.10.2007 and for permanent\n\ninjunction. The plaintiff was in possession of the schedule property as a tenant.\n\nThe defendant to meet her family requirements offered to sell the same for a\n\ntotal sale consideration of Rs.20,50,000/- and on receipt of a huge amount of\n\nRs.15,00,000/- as advance sale consideration, which was about 73% of the total\n\nsale consideration, the defendant inducted the plaintiff into possession by virtue\n\nof the agreement of sale dated 31.10.2007 and agreed to execute the registered\n\nsale deed on receipt of balance sale consideration. The defendant failed to\n\nfurnish copy of her title deed documents to prepare a draft sale deed. The\n\ndefendant postponed to handover the original title deed documents stating that\n\nshe was yet to clear off the loans to get it released from her creditor. However,\n\nthe defendant issued a legal notice on 12.07.2016 to the plaintiff intimating\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nabout the cancellation of the agreement of sale dated 31.10.2007 stating that it\n\nwas barred by limitation and that the plaintiff was not ready to pay the balance\n\nsale consideration amount within three years from 31.10.2007 and demanded\n\nthe plaintiff to vacate the premises claiming damages of Rs.30,000/- per month.\n\nThe plaintiff got issued a reply legal notice on 21.07.2016 expressing her\n\nwillingness to perform her part of the agreement and to receive the balance sale\n\nconsideration within 15 days from the date of receipt of the legal notice. But\n\nthe said notice was returned un-served on the defendant as refused. Hence, the\n\nplaintiff filed the suit for specific performance of agreement of sale also seeking\n\nthe relief of permanent injunction.\n\n3. The defendant filed written statement contending that the plaintiff was a\n\ntenant in the schedule house prior to the alleged agreement and she was\n\ncontinuing in possession in that status. The suit schedule premises was let out\n\nto the plaintiff on oral lease on 09.01.2004 on a monthly rent of Rs.6,000/-.\n\nThereafter, the plaintiff approached the defendant and forced the defendant to\n\nsell the suit house. The defendant agreed to sell the same. The agreement of\n\nsale was reduced into writing on 31.10.2007. The sale consideration was fixed\n\nat Rs.20,50,000/-. As on the date of agreement of sale, a sum of Rs.15,00,000/-\n\nwas received by the defendant towards advance sale consideration and the said\n\nfact was mentioned in the agreement of sale. It was mutually understood\n\nbetween the defendant and the plaintiff that the balance sale consideration of\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nRs.5,50,000/- would be payable within a short time. By virtue of the said\n\nagreement of sale, no possession was delivered and the plaintiff was never\n\ninducted into the suit premises in that status. The possession of the plaintiff\n\nover the schedule premises was only in the capacity of tenant but not as a\n\npurchaser. The said fact was categorically mentioned in clause (3) of the\n\nagreement. It was mutually agreed that time was essence of the contract. The\n\nplaintiff failed to pay the balance sale consideration within three years from\n\n31.10.2007, which lapsed by 30.10.2010. In view of the latches on the part of\n\nthe plaintiff, the agreement was cancelled, the contract was terminated. The\n\ndefendant issued legal notice dated 12.07.2016 informing the plaintiff that the\n\nadvance amount of Rs.15,00,000/- was forfeited and the agreement was\n\nterminated and demanded the plaintiff to vacate the premises and to pay\n\nRs.30,000/- towards damages every month from 01.10.2016 till she vacated the\n\npremises.\n\n3.1. The defendant further stated that she also filed O.S.761 of 2016 on\n\n21.09.2016 against the plaintiff for eviction on the file of the VII Additional\n\nJunior Civil Judge, Warangal and also claimed mesne profits in the said suit.\n\nShe further stated that the alleged agreement of sale dated 31.10.2007 was an\n\noutright sale deed as per the recitals in the document and the same was\n\ninadmissible in evidence and was barred under\nSection 35\nof the Stamp Act,\n\n1899. The same was compulsorily registerable under\nSections 17\nand\nof the\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nRegistration Act, 1908\n. In the absence of payment of requisite stamp duty, the\n\nalleged documents could not be looked into as the same was barred by law and\n\nstamp duty and penalty shall be collected on the said document.\n\n4. After framing the issues, the suit was posted for trial.\n\n5. On 28.03.2023, the plaintiff filed her evidence affidavit and got marked\n\nExs.A1 to A8. The defendant was not present at that time and there was no\n\nrepresentation for the defendant. The court marked the agreement of sale\n\ndated 31.10.2007 as Ex.A1 on the basis of the chief-examination affidavit of\n\nPW.1. When the matter was coming up for cross-examination of PW.1, the\n\ndefendant filed a petition under Order XIII Rule 3 read with\nSections 33\nand\nof the Stamp Act, 1899 and\nSections 17\nand\nof the Registration Act, 1908\n\nread with\nSection 151\nof CPC to de-exhibit Ex.A1 agreement of sale and to hear\n\nabout the admissibility of the document with regard to payment of Stamp duty\n\nand penalty stating that the same was marked without the knowledge and\n\nconsent of the defendant and the court failed to scrutinize the contents of the\n\nsaid document.\n\n6. The plaintiff filed counter to the said application contending that once a\n\ndocument had been admitted in evidence, such admission could not be called in\n\nquestion at any stage of the suit or proceedings and all the objections had to be\n\nraised before marking the document in evidence and once it was marked, it was\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nnot open either to the parties or even to the court to re-examine the order. The\n\nplaintiff also contended that though possession was delivered as per the\n\nagreement of sale, the right and title in the schedule property remained with the\n\ndefendant. Under the said circumstances, the provision of\nSections 33\nand\nof\n\nthe Stamp Act, 1899 were not attracted. When there was contemplation of\n\nexecution of further document i.e. registration of sale deed in future in\n\npursuance of Ex.A1, the transferee though in possession would be holding the\n\nproperty as an agreement holder but not with any clear animus that she has\n\nbecome absolute owner of the property or in complete negation of any right or\n\ntitle of the transferor and the provisions of\nSections 33\nand\nof the Stamp Act\n\nwere not attracted. Since the suit was for specific performance, none of the\n\nprovisions of the\nRegistration Act\nwere affected.\n\n7. On hearing both the counsel, the learned Principal District Judge,\n\nHanumakonda allowed the application ordering de-exhibiting of Ex.A1 holding\n\nthat the plaintiff was at liberty to get the agreement of sale dated 31.10.2007\n\nimpounded under law by paying deficit stamp duty and penalty as required\n\nunder Article 47-A of Schedule 1-\nA of the Stamp Act\n.\n\n8. Aggrieved by the said order and decree, the plaintiff preferred this\n\nrevision contending that the respondent - defendant filed the petition without\n\nthe support of any provision of law under\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\nor any\n\nsupportive statute and the court ought to have rejected the petition filed by the\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nrespondent - defendant at the threshold. The court below failed to appreciate\n\nthe law and the citations referred to by the petitioner - plaintiff in her written\n\narguments. The court below failed to appreciate the fact that the respondent -\n\ndefendant and her advocate failed to present themselves on the date of marking\n\nof documents on behalf of the petitioner - plaintiff as PW.1 and their failure\n\ncould not be attributed to the petitioner - plaintiff for de-exhibiting the marked\n\nexhibit as Ex.A1. The court below failed to appreciate that even though\n\ndelivery of possession was mentioned in Ex.A1, it would not change its\n\ncharacter, as it would be concluded by execution of regular conveyance deed.\n\nThe document pressed into service by the petitioner - plaintiff was for the relief\n\nof specific performance in her favour. It does not hit the language employed in\n\nSection 17\nof the Indian Stamp Act and\nSection 49\nof the Registration Act. The\n\ncourt below ought to have considered it as an agreement to be enforced through\n\nspecific performance and could have rejected the petition filed by the\n\nrespondent - defendant. Even as per the pleadings advanced by the\n\nrespondent - defendant, she unilaterally issued the notice to the petitioner -\n\nplaintiff cancelling the agreement of sale entered with the petitioner - plaintiff.\n\nContrary to that, she could not plead in the petition that the document executed\n\nby her was a sale deed which required stamp duty on it. The respondent -\n\ndefendant conveniently deviated from her own pleadings in the petition. The\n\ncourt below ought to have seen that as per the recitals of Ex.A1, the outstanding\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\namount of Rs.5,50,000/- of the total sale consideration, had to be paid by the\n\npetitioner - plaintiff, then only, the transaction of sale between them would be\n\nconcluded. Once, the court admitted the document and marked it as an exhibit\n\nin the suit, the court could not revert its order without any support of statutory\n\nlaw or authority. De-exhibiting Ex.A1 by the court below was against the\n\nsettled law and procedure contemplated. As per\nSection 36\nof the Stamp Act,\n\nwherein an instrument had been admitted in evidence, such admission shall not,\n\nexcept as provided under\nSection 61\n, be called in question at any stage of the\n\nsuit or proceedings on the ground that, the instrument had not been duly\n\nstamped. The court below ignored the above provision and prayed to set aside\n\nthe order passed by the Principal District Judge, Hanumakonda in I.A.No.630 of\n\n2023 in O.S.No.188 of 2022 dated 15.06.2023.\n\n9. Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner - plaintiff and the\n\nlearned counsel for the respondent - defendant.\n\n10. As seen from the record, the petition in I.A.No.630 of 2023 in\n\nO.S.No.188 of 2022 was filed by the respondent - defendant under\nOrder XIII\n\nRule 3 of CPC\nread with\nSections 33\nand\nof the Stamp Act and\nSection 17\n\nand\nof the Registration Act read with\nSection 151\nof CPC for de-exhibiting\n\nEx.A1 agreement of sale. Thus, this Court does not find any merit in the\n\ncontention of the learned counsel for the revision petitioner - plaintiff that the\n\nrespondent - defendant filed the petition without support of any provision of\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nlaw under\nthe Code of Civil Procedure\nor any supportive statute and the said\n\npetition was liable to be rejected at the threshold.\n\n11. The other contention taken by the learned counsel for the revision\n\npetitioner - plaintiff was that the respondent - defendant and her advocate failed\n\nto present themselves on the date of marking of document on behalf of the\n\npetitioner - plaintiff as PW.1 and their failure could not be attributed to the\n\nrevision petitioner - plaintiff for de-exhibiting the marked exhibit as Ex.A1.\n\n12. On a perusal of the pleadings, the respondent - defendant in her written\n\nstatement itself contended that the said document agreement of sale was barred\n\nby law under\nSection 35\nof the Stamp Act and that the same was compulsorily\n\nregisterable under\nSections 17\nand\nof the Registration Act and it should be\n\ntreated as an outright sale deed and stamp duty and penalty should be collected\n\nand that the said document could not be received even in a suit for specific\n\nperformance of contract and the same was inadmissible in evidence. But\n\nignoring the said contentions, the trial court marked the said document as Ex.A1\n\non 28.03.2023 in the absence of the defendant or her counsel. The trial court in\n\nits order in I.A.No.630 of 2023 noted that the court did not notice due to\n\noversight about insufficiency of stamp duty on the said document at the time of\n\nits marking as exhibit and the advocate for plaintiff also did not bring to the\n\nnotice of the court about the said fact.\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n13. Notice should be given to the respondent - defendant at the time of filing\n\nof the evidence affidavit of PW.1 and the defendant or her counsel need to be\n\npresent at the time of recording the evidence of PW.1 and marking the\n\ndocuments and they need to raise the necessary objections for marking the\n\ndocuments. It was not known whether any notice was given to the respondent -\n\ndefendant on the chief affidavit of PW.1. The defendant or her counsel failed to\n\nbe present at the time of recording the evidence of PW.1 and marking the\n\ndocuments. The court itself also need to be careful while marking the\n\ndocuments and need to look into whether the documents would require any\n\nstamp duty or penalty or they were in accordance with the provisions of law.\n\nWhen the matter was posted for the cross-examination of PW.1, the respondent\n\n- defendant immediately filed I.A.No.630 of 2023 to de-exhibit Ex.A1 and to\n\nhear with regard to the admissibility of the said document.\n\n14. The learned counsel for the respondent - defendant placed reliance on the\n\njudgment of the combined High Court of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in\n\nSyed Yousuf Ali v. Mohd.Yousuf and Others\n1, wherein also it was contended\n\nthat when a document is admitted and marked as exhibit, it could not be\n\nquestioned except under\nSection 61\nin view of interdict contained under\nSection\nof Indian Stamp Act, it was held that:\nC.R.P.No.4794 of 2015 dated 05.02.2016\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n\"16. No doubt,\nSection 36\nof the Act created an\ninterdict to raise an objection about admissibility\nof document, once admitted, except\nunder\nSection 61\n, it is the duty of the Court to\napply its mind about the admissibility and\ndetermine judicially but the Presiding Officer\nfailed to look into the admissibility of the\ndocument for want of stamp duty and penalty.\n\nPutting signature on the stamp of marking on the\ndocument cannot be considered as admission of\na document in evidence. When similar issue\ncame up before Division Bench of this Court in\nW.P.No.29434 of 2013, dated 12.02.2014,\nplacing reliance on judgment of Apex Court\nin\nR.V.E.Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu\nViswesaraswami\n[AIR 2003 SC 4548] and\nV.P.Temple and another and Ram Rattan\n(dead) by legal representatives v. Bajranlal\nand others [AIR 1978 SC 1393] drawn\ndistinction between admitting in evidence and\nmarking of document. Marking of a document is\nonly for convenient reference, whereas,\nadmitting document is taking the document as\nevidence after applying judicial mind.\n\nIn view of\nprinciple\nlaid down in\n\nR.V.E.Venkatachala\nGounders\ncase [AIR 2003 SC 4548] and Ram\nRattan (dead) by LRs case [AIR 1978 SC 1393],\nthe parties can raise objection as to admissibility\nof document and mere marking of document for\nconvenience of reference would not preclude the\nparties to raise objection as to the admissibility.\n\nIn\nR.V.E.Venkatachala Gounders\ncase [AIR\n2003 SC 4548], the Apex Court is of the view\nthat merely because a document is marked as\nexhibit an objection as to its admissibility is not\nexcluded and is available to be raised even at a\nlater stage or even in appeal or revision.\n\nSimilarly in Ram Rattan's case [AIR 1978 SC\n1393], the Supreme Court is of the view that\nwhen the document was tendered in evidence by\nthe plaintiff while in witness box, objection has\nbeen raised by the defendants that the document\nwas inadmissible in evidence as it was not only\ninsufficiently stamped, but also for want of\nregistration, it was obligatory upon the learned\ntrial judge to apply his mind to the objection\nraised and decide the objection in accordance\nwith law. Tendency sometimes is to postpone\nthe decision to avoid interruption in the process\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nof recording evidence and therefore, a very\nconvenient device is resorted to, of marking the\ndocument in evidence subject to objection.\nHowever, would not mean that the objection as\nto admissibility on the ground that the\ninstrument is not duly stamped is judicially\ndecided; it is merely postponed. In such a\nsituation at a later stage before the suit is finally\ndisposed of it would none-the-less be obligatory\nupon the Court to decide the objection. The\nendorsement made by the learned trial Judge\nthat objected, allowed subject to objection,\nclearly indicates that when the objection was\nraised, it was not judicially determined and the\ndocument was tentatively marked and in such a\nsituation,\nSection 36\nwould not attract. Though\nfacts are different, the law laid down by the\nCourts time and again is that to admit a\ndocument in evidence the Court has to apply its\nmind and decide the admissibility of document\nin evidence, judicially, mere marking for\nconvenience of reference itself would not\namount to admitting the document by applying\njudicial mind and it is not a judicial\ndetermination as to the admissibility of\ndocument in evidence.\nSection 35\ncreated clear\nembargo against acting upon insufficiently\nstamped document for any purpose. Any\npurpose would include collateral purpose. Even\nif both parties gave consent for marking\ninsufficiently stamped document, it shall not be\nact upon, more particularly to enforce the right\nof parties under contract of sale, unless it falls\nunder any clauses of proviso. The present\ndocument does not fall within any of the clauses\nof proviso to\nSection 35\nof the Act, when\ndocument shall not be acted upon admitting the\nsame by consent would mean that it is the duty\nof the Court to decide admissibility of document\nin evidence judicially.\n\n17. In such situation, the bar under\nSection 36\nof\nthe Act would not come in the way of the parties\nto raise an objection as to the admissibility of\nthe document. In the present case except affixing\nstamp giving numerical number to the\npossessory contract of sale as Ex.A.1, signing\nthereon by officer, nothing discloses about the\njudicial determination of admissibility of\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\npossessory contract of sale. The provisions\nof\nStamp Act\nare fiscal in nature and such\nprovisions have to be construed strictly, at the\nsame time, it is the duty of the office to decide\nor determine judicially about admissibility of the\ndocument, irrespective of objection to avoid loss\nof revenue to the State. In the absence of any\njudicial determination about admissibility of the\ndocument, the same can be questioned at a later\nstage though stamp is affixed marking the\ndocument as exhibit.\"\n\n15. In the present case also, there is no judicial determination about the\n\nadmissibility of the document at the time of its marking. As per the judgment of\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in\nR.V.E.Venkatachala Gounder v. Arulmigu\n\nViswesaraswami\n[AIR 2003 SC 4548], merely because the document was\n\nmarked as an exhibit, an objection as to its admissibility was not excluded and\n\nthe same was available to be raised even at a later stage or even in appeal or\n\nrevision.\n\n16. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner relied upon the judgment\n\nof the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nSirikonda Madhava Rao v. N.Hemalatha and\n\nOthers\n2 on the aspect that once a document has been admitted in evidence, such\n\nadmission cannot be called in question at any stage of the suit or proceedings on\n\nthe ground that the instrument has not been duly stamped. Objection as to\n\nadmissibility of a document on the ground of insufficiency of stamp, has to be\n\nraised when the document is tendered in evidence. Thereafter, it is not open to\n\nthe parties, or even to the court to re-examine the order or issue.\n2022 Live Law 970\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n17. The judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nR.V.E.Venkatachala\n\nGounder v. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami\n[AIR 2003 SC 4548] was not referred\n\nin\nthe above case\n. As there was a detailed discussion\nin\nthe above case\nby the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court between admitting a document in evidence and marking of\n\ndocument and\nthe said judgment\nwas not considered by the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nwhile rendering its order\nin\nthe above case\n, this Court does not find any merit in\n\nthe contention of the learned counsel for the revision petitioner - plaintiff that it\n\nwas not open to the parties to re-examine the order or issue with regard to\n\nmarking the document as an exhibit.\n\n18. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh in\nSyed Yousuf Ali\n's Case (cited\n\nsupra) also held that:\n\n\"21. When the documents were marked as\nexhibits in the absence of defendant or his\ncounsel and without considering the nature of\nthe document by the Court, assigning exhibit\nnumber cannot be said to be admitted in\nevidence and interdict contained in\nSection\nwould not come to the aid of the party in\nwhose evidence the document was marked as\nexhibit without any judicial determination,\ntotally debarring the adversary to challenge the\nadmissibility of document in evidence.\nIn\nVemireddy Kota Reddy's Case [2004 (3) ALD\n187], single Judge of this Court relied on\nJaver\nChand and others v. Pukhraj Surana\nto\nconclude that marking of a document is\nassigning exhibit number without judicial\ndetermination would not amount to admitting\ndocument in evidence and such objection can be\nraised at later point of time.\n\n22. Whereas, learned counsel for the\nrespondents placed reliance in T.Nagaratnam's\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\ncase [2006 (3) ALD 838], so also\nM.Narasimhulu's case [1996 Law Suit (AP)\n447] and Isra Fatima's case [2002 Law Suit\n832]. In all the three judgments, the single\nJudges of this Court decided the bar contained\nunder\nSection 36\nof Indian Stamp Act holding\nthat until and unless there is a judicial\ndetermination it cannot be said that it has been\nadmitted in evidence though it is marked. Mere\nmarking of document itself is not sufficient and\nthere should be judicial determination as to the\nnature of document and its admissibility. Further\nthe words admitted in evidence appearing\nunder\nSection 36\nof the Act means admitted\nafter judicial consideration of objections relating\nto admissibility. In the absence of judicial\ndetermination marking of document\nmechanically is an illegality. Even otherwise at\nany stage of the suit, the Court may reject any\ndocument which it considers irrelevant or\notherwise inadmissible in view of\nOrder 13 Rule\n3 CPC\n.\n\n24. According to\nOrder 13 Rule 3 CPC\nthe Court\nmay at any stage of the suit, reject any document\nwhich it considers irrelevant or otherwise\ninadmissible, recording the grounds for such\nrejection.\nOrder 13 Rule 4 CPC\nprescribes an\nendorsement to be made on the document when\na document is admitted in evidence. According\nto it, there shall be an endorsement on every\ndocument which has been admitted in evidence\ncontaining number and title of the suit, the name\nof the person producing the document, the date\non which it was produced and a statement of its\nhaving been so admitted and the endorsement\nshall be signed or initialled by the Judge.\n\n25. Here there is an endorsement on the reverse\nof possessory contract of sale consisting the\ndetails under Order 13 Rule 4(1)(A) to (C), 1(D)\nis absent. Therefore, the document cannot be\nsaid to be admitted after judicial determination,\nin such a case, exercising power under\nOrder 13\nRule 3 CPC\n, the Court can reject any document\nwhich it considers irrelevant or in-admissible,\nrecording reasons.\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n19.\nIn the present case also, as there is no judicial determination about the\n\nadmissibility of Ex.A1, this Court agrees with the view taken by the High Court\n\nof Andhra Pradesh in\nSyed Yousuf Ali\n's case (cited supra) and finds no merit in\n\nthe contention of the learned counsel for the revision petitioner on this aspect.\n\n20. The other contention raised by the learned counsel for the revision\n\npetitioner was that even though delivery of possession was mentioned in the\n\ndocument, the agreement of sale would not change its character as a transaction\n\nof sale, as the transaction would be concluded only by execution of regular\n\nconveyance deed. The recitals of the document would show that it was only an\n\nagreement of sale and as such not hit by the language employed in\nSection 17\nof\n\nthe Indian Stamp Act and also\nSection 49\nof the Registration Act and relied\n\nupon the judgment of the High Court of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in\n\nBhimavarapu Laxma Reddy v. Pallothu Aswini Kumar\n3 on the aspect that\n\nan agreement holder, even if in possession and enjoyment of property, does not\n\nacquire any title to property. Entries in the revenue records whether pursuant to\n\nthe mutation or without mutation also do not confer title.\n2015 (5) ALD 500\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n21. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner also relied upon the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nAchal Reddi v. Ramakrishna Reddiar\n\nand Others\n4, wherein also it was held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that:\n\n\"In the case of an agreement of sale the party\nwho obtains possession, acknowledges title\nof the vendor even though the agreement of\nsale may be invalid. It is an\nacknowledgement and recognition of the\ntitle of the vendor which excludes the theory\nof adverse possession. The well-settled rule\nof law is that if person is in actual possession\nand has a right to possession under a title\ninvolving a due recognition of the owner's\ntitle his possession will not be regarded as\nadverse in law, even though he claims under\nanother title having regard to the well\nrecognized policy of law that possession is\nnever considered adverse if it is referable to\na lawful title. The purchaser who got to\npossession under an executory contract of\nsale in a permissible character cannot be\nheard to contend that his possession was\nadverse. In the conception of adverse\npossession there is an essential and basic\ndifference between a case in which the other\nparty is put in possession of property by an\noutright transfer, both parties stipulating for\na total divestiture of all the rights of the\ntransferor in the property, and in case in\nwhich, there is a mere executory agreement\nof transfer both parties contemplating a deed\nof transfer to be executed at a later point of\ntime. In the latter case the principle of\nestoppel applies estopping the transferee\nfrom contending that his possession, while\nthe contract remained executory in stage,\nwas in his own right and adversely against\nthe transferor. Adverse possession implies\nthat it commenced in wrong and is\nAIR 1990 SC 553\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nmaintained against right. When the\ncommencement and continuance of\npossession is legal and proper, referable to a\ncontract, it cannot be adverse.\"\n\n22. Both the above judgments are rendered while considering whether a\n\npurchaser who was put in possession basing on an executory contract of sale\n\nwould acquire title over it. These judgments are not relevant for considering\n\nwhether the stamp duty is payable or not on the agreement of sale when the\n\npurchaser was put in possession of the property.\n\n23. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner also relied upon the\n\njudgment of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in\nRam Kishan and\n\nAnother v. Bijeder Mann @ Vijender Mann and Others\n5, wherein it was\n\nconsidered that though a purchaser was put in possession by way of agreement\n\nto sell, if the buyer fails to pay the balance sale consideration within the\n\nprescribed time and does not apply for extention of time, the seller would be\n\nentitled to get the contract rescinded and therefore the document cannot be\n\nconsidered as a sale deed but only an agreement to sell. This judgment is also\n\nnot applicable to the facts of this case as it was also not rendered under the\n\nprovisions of the\nStamp Act\n.\n2015 Law Suit (P&H) 4786\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n24. The other judgment relied by the learned counsel for the revision\n\npetitioner was that of the Hon'ble Apex Court in R.Hemalatha v. Kasthuri 6,\n\nwherein it was held that:\n\n\"an unregistered document affecting the\nimmovable property and required by the\n\nRegistration Act\nor the\nTransfer of Property Act\n\nto be registered, may be received as evidence of\na contract in a suit for specific performance\nunder Chapter­II of the Specific Relief Act,\n1877 or as evidence of any collateral transaction\nnot required to be affected by registered\ninstrument as per proviso to\nSection 49\nof the\nRegistration Act. However, the same is subject\nto\nSection 17 (1A)\nof the Registration Act.\n\n25. There is no dispute with the proposition laid down by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt that as per proviso to\nSection 49\nof the Registration Act, an unregistered\n\nagreement to sell shall be admissible in evidence in a suit for specific\n\nperformance and the proviso is exception to the first part of the\nSection 49\n. The\n\nsaid judgment is rendered while considering the effect of Tamilnadu\n\nAmendment by which\nSection 17(1)(g)\nof the Registration Act had been\n\ninserted which makes agreement to sell immovable property valued above\n\nRs.100/- compulsorily registerable. The Hon'ble Apex Court held that the\n\namendment would not affect proviso to\nSection 49\n, which allows un-registered\n\nsale agreements to be received in evidence, an un-registered agreement to sell\n\nimmovable property can be received in evidence in a suit for specific\n\nperformance.\n2023 Live Law (SC) 304\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n26. The only question now to be decided is: whether an agreement to sell\n\ncoupled with possession can be received in evidence without payment of the\n\nrequisite stamp duty and penalty.\n\n27. The learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand relied upon the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nOmprakash v. Laxminarayan and\n\nOthers\n7, wherein on similar facts, it was held that:\n\n\"11. As stated earlier, the plaintiffs filed a suit\nfor specific performance of contract and their\ncase is founded on the agreement to sell\nexecuted on 27th December, 2000. The\nagreement to sell acknowledges payment of the\npart of consideration money and further giving\nactual physical possession to the purchaser by\nthe seller. Though the defendants dispute that,\nbut in our opinion, for determination of the\nquestion of admissibility of a document, it is the\nrecital therein which shall be decisive. Whether\nthe possession in fact was given or not in terms\nof the agreement to sell is a question of fact\nwhich requires adjudication. But, at the time of\nconsidering the question of admissibility of\ndocument, it is the recital therein which shall\ngovern the issue. It does not mean that the recital\nin the document shall be conclusive but for the\npurpose of admissibility it is the terms and\nconditions incorporated therein which shall hold\nthe field. Having said that, we proceed to\nconsider as to whether the document in question\nis \"conveyance\" within the meaning of\nSection\n2(10)\nof the Act.\n\n12.\nSection 2(10)\nof the Act reads as follows:\n\n2. Definitions. - In this Act, unless\nthere is something repugnant in the\nsubject or context, -\n(2014) 1 SCC 618\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n(10)\"Conveyance\" -\n\n'Conveyance' includes a\nconveyance on sale and every\ninstrument by which property,\nwhether movable or\nimmovable, is transferred inter\nvivos and which is not\notherwise specifically provided\nfor by Schedule I;\n\n13. From a plain reading of the aforesaid\nprovision, it is evident that an instrument by\nwhich movable or immovable property is\ntransferred, comes within the expression\n\"conveyance\". In the present case, an\nimmovable property is transferred on payment\nof part of the consideration and handing over the\npossession of the property.\n\n14. It is relevant here to state that by the Indian\nStamp (Madhya Pradesh Second Amendment)\nAct, 1990 (Act No.22 of 1990) few Articles\nincluding\nArticle 23\nof Schedule 1-A have been\nsubstituted and Explanation has been added\nto\nArticle 23.\nThe Explanation appended\nto\nArticle 23\nof Schedule 1-\nA of the Stamp\nAct\nas substituted by Section (6) of Act 22 of\n1990 reads as follows:\n\n\"Explanation.--For the purpose of\nthis article, where in the case of\nagreement to sell immovable\nproperty, the possession of any\nimmovable property is transferred to\nthe purchaser before execution or\nafter execution of, such agreement\nwithout executing the conveyance in\nrespect thereof then such agreement\nto sell shall be deemed to be a\nconveyance and stamp duty thereon\nshall be leviable accordingly:\n\nProvided that, the provisions\nof Section 47-A shall apply mutatis\nmutandis to such agreement which is\ndeemed to be a conveyance as\naforesaid, as they apply to a\nconveyance under that section:\n\nProvided further that where\nsubsequently a conveyance is\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\neffected in pursuance of such\nagreement of sale the stamp duty, if\nany, already paid and recovered on\nthe agreement of sale which is\ndeemed to be a conveyance shall be\nadjusted towards the total duty\nleviable on the conveyance, subject\nto a minimum of Rs. 10.\"\n\nThe aforesaid Explanation has come into effect\nwith effect from 26th September, 1990. The\nExplanation, therefore, creates a legal fiction.\nThe agreement to sell shall be deemed to be a\nconveyance and stamp duty is leviable on an\ninstrument whereby possession has been\ntransferred. Thus the agreement to sell in\nquestion is a conveyance within the meaning\nof\nSection 2(10)\nof the Act and is to be duly\nstamped.\n\n15.\nSection 35\nof the Act makes instruments not\nduly stamped inadmissible in evidence, the\nrelevant portion whereof reads as follows:\n\n\"35. Instruments not duly stamped\ninadmissible in evidence, etc.- No\ninstrument chargeable with duty\nshall be admitted in evidence for any\npurpose by any person having by law\nor consent of parties authority to\nreceive evidence, or shall be acted\nupon, registered or authenticated by\nany such person or by any public\nofficer, unless such instrument is\nduly stamped:\n\nProvided that-\n\n(a) any such instrument shall be\nadmitted in evidence on payment of\nthe duty with which the same is\nchargeable or, in the case of an\ninstrument insufficiently stamped, of\nthe amount required to make up such\nduty, together with a penalty of five\nrupees, or, when ten times the\namount of the proper duty or\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\ndeficient portion thereof exceeds five\nrupees, of a sum equal to ten times\nsuch duty or portion;\"\n\n16. From a plain reading of the aforesaid\nprovision, it is evident that an authority to\nreceive evidence shall not admit any instrument\nunless it is duly stamped. An instrument not\nduly stamped shall be admitted in evidence on\npayment of the duty with which the same is\nchargeable or in the case of an instrument\ninsufficiently stamped, of the amount required to\nmake up such duty together with penalty. As we\nhave observed earlier, the deed of agreement\nhaving been insufficiently stamped, the same\nwas inadmissible in evidence. The court being\nan authority to receive a document in evidence\nto give effect thereto, the agreement to sell with\npossession is an instrument which requires\npayment of the stamp duty applicable to a deed\nof conveyance. Duty as required, has not been\npaid and, hence, the trial court rightly held the\nsame to be inadmissible in evidence.\n\n28. The facts of\nthe above case\nas well as the reasoning given by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in considering the Stamp (Madhya Pradesh Second Amendment)\n\nAct, 1990 are applicable mutatis mutandis to this case also.\n\n29. He also relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nNavneetha Lokesh Puthran v. M.Suryanarayana Kalkura and Others\n8 ,\n\nwherein also it was held that:\n\n\"For the purpose of admissibility of a document\nit is recitals contained therein that are decisive\nand not factual situation on ground. Thus, as\nagreement to sell contained a clear recital that\npossession had been transferred to buyer, same\nshall be deemed to be a conveyance for\ncomputation of stamp duty under above-said\n\nArticle 23\nexplanation - contention that\n(2020) 19 SCC 8\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\npossession in fact not having been delivered to\nbuyer is not relevant for computation of stamp\nduty.\n\n30. The Hon'ble Apex Court\nin\nthe above case\nheld that even though\n\npossession was in fact not delivered to the buyer, it was the recitals of the\n\ndocument that were decisive for the purpose of admissibility of a document.\n\nThe said judgment was rendered under\nSections 35\n,\nand\nand\n\nSchedule 1-A of\nArticle 23\nof the Stamp (Madhya Pradesh Second Amendment)\n\nAct, 1990.\n\n31. The learned counsel for the respondent also relied upon the judgment of\n\nthe High Court of Andhra Pradesh in\nK.J.K.Setty v. K.N.Setty\n9, wherein also\n\npossession was delivered basing on an agreement of sale, it was held that:\n\n\"12. In the present case, suit itself is filed by the\nrespondent/plaintiff for specific performance of\na contract and recitals of the document as\nreferred supra clearly shows that there is a\nclause of executing registered sale deed after\nreceiving Rs.4,00,000/- within three months\nwhich itself shows that document is agreement\nof sale though it is between co-owners wherein\nthere is a recitals with regard to delivery of\npossession and document, which is an\nagreement of sale is followed by delivery of\npossession. This Court in\nMakineni Srinivas\nRao and others v. Manthena Prabhakar\nReddy\n[2014 (6) AndhLD 261] had an occasion\nto consider the scope of Explanation I of Article\n47-\nA of Schedule I-A of the Indian Stamp Act,\nand opined at Para Nos.7 to 11 which\nextracted hereunder:\n\n\"7. Explanation I of Article 47-\nA of\nSchedule I-A of the Act\nenvisages\n2023 (3) ALT 296\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nthat an agreement to sell followed by\nor evidencing delivery of possession\nof the property agreed to be sold\nshall be chargeable as a \"Sale\". In\nthe opinion of this Court, the words\n\"followed by or evidencing delivery\nof possession of the property\" shall\nbe construed to mean that delivery of\npossession shall be concurrent with\nor immediately after the execution of\nagreement of sale and the said\nprovision does not attract a case\nwhere delivery of possession takes\nplace long time after the execution of\nthe agreement of sale. The words\n\"followed by or evidencing delivery\nof possession\" in Explanation I fell\nfor consideration of a Division\nBench of this Court in\nB.\nRatnamala v. G.Rudramma\n[1999\n(6) ALT 159: 1999 (6) AndhLD\n160]. While reading the two phrases\nviz., \"followed by\" and \"evidencing\"\n\nseparately, the Bench held that in the\nformer case, even in the absence of a\nrecital in the agreement, the delivery\nmust be contemporaneous with the\nexecution of agreement and that\npossession should be intimately and\ninextricably connected with the\nagreement. In the latter case, it held\nthat in order to attract this\nexplanation, the agreement must\ncontain a recital of delivery of\npossession either prior to or after the\nagreement.\n\n8. On a careful reading of\nExplanation I and the Division\nBench judgment in B. Ratnamala\n[1999 (6) ALT 159: 1999 (6)\nAndhLD 160], I am of the opinion\nthat in cases where the agreement\ndoes not contain the recital of\ndelivery of possession, it must be\nexamined whether possession\n\"followed\" the agreement. What\nprecisely is the meaning of the word\n\"followed\"? The Oxford dictionary,\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nThesaurus and Word power guide\n(Indian edition 2007) explained the\nmeaning of the word \"follow\" as\nmove or travel behind \"go along\"\n\n\"come after in time or order\" \"be a\nlogical consequence of\" \"(follow\nthrough) continue (an action or task\nto its conclusion\".\n\n9. Thus, in the absence of express\nrecital in the agreement on delivery\nof possession, in order to levy stamp\nduty chargeable to conveyance in\nrespect of an agreement of sale, it\nmust be shown that possession\nfollowed as a logical consequence of\nthe agreement. As explained by the\nApex Court in\nVeena Hansmukh\nJain v. State of Maharashtra\n, by\nintroducing Explanation I, the\nlegislature intended that the stamp\nduty as applicable to conveyance\nshall be collected in advance where\ndelivery of possession was involved\nat the agreement stage itself and\nexecution of conveyance deed\nremains a mere formality.\n\n10. Where the agreement does not\ncontain the recital relating to\npossession, what needs to be seen is\nwhether delivery of possession was\nin contemplation of the parties at the\ntime of execution of the agreement\nitself. This can be ascertained with\nreference to the point of time of such\ndelivery. If delivery is simultaneous\nto or concurrent or contemporaneous\nwith the execution of agreement of\nsale, it can be safely concluded that\nthe parties have intended delivery of\npossession though such a recital is\nabsent in the agreement. If on the\ncontrary there is a reasonable time\nlag between execution of agreement\nand delivery of possession, it cannot\nbe construed that such delivery\nfollowed the agreement. At best it\namounts to delivery of possession in\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\npursuance of and not following the\nagreement of sale.\n\n11. In my opinion, the legislature has\nconsciously used the restrictive\nexpression followed by preceding the\nwords An agreement to sell in\nExplanation I. It has not used the\nexpansive words such as in\npursuance of for it evidently wanted\nlevying and collection of stamp duty\nchargeable for conveyances only in\ncases where parties to agreement of\nsale intended delivery of possession\nat the agreement stage itself without\nwaiting for execution of regular\nconveyance deed. It is trite that\nprovisions of a fiscal statute need to\nbe strictly construed.\"\n\n13. The said decision is followed by this Court\nin Chunduru Abbaiah ... Petitioner v.\n\nGarlapati Satyanarayana ... Respondent\n[2020 (6) ALT 305] though\nthe said decision\nit\nis held that recitals of agreement of sale shows\nthat possession was not delivered and ratio in\nthe\nsaid decision\nis that if possession is followed by\nor evidencing delivery of possession as per the\ndocument, it requires stamp duty under Article\n47-\nA of Schedule IA of Indian Stamp Act\n. This\nCourt in G.Kiran Kumar .... Petitioner v.\n\nN.Venkateswara Reddy and others ...\n\nRespondent by following Judgment of Hon'ble\nApex Court in C.R.P.No. 2874 of 2017, dated\n20.12.2018 following ratio\nlaid down by\nHon'ble\nApex Court in\nOmprakash v. Laxminarayan\nand others\n[(2014) 1 SCC 618] and after\nelaborately discussing precedent law held that\nagreement of sale, which is inadequately\nstamped has to be impounded as per provisions\nof stamp act.\n\n14. On perusal of recitals of the document which\nalso contains a recital that a future document can\nbe executed which shows that transaction of sale\nis not completed unless another document is\nexecuted due to that it cannot be said that it is a\nunregistered sale deed though it contains recital\nwith regard to delivery of possession and\ndocument evidencing delivery of property.\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nThough the document is said to be agreement of\nsale evidencing delivery of possession which\ncan be treated as \"Conveyance\", which can be\nreceived in evidence in part performance of a\ncontract after collecting stamp duty and penalty\nas a sale as per Explanation I of Article 47-\nA of\nSchedule I of Indian Stamp Act\n. This Court in\n\nUmmadi Subramanyam v. Ekka Dhanamma\nand another\n[1999 (4) ALT 706] held that\nproviso of\nsection 49\nof Registration Act shows\nthat an unregistered document effecting\nimmovable property though required registration\nmay be received in evidence of a contract in a\nsuit for specific performance after collecting\nstamp duty and penalty.\"\n\n32. In the light of the above judgments, it can be seen that it was the recitals\n\nin the document which are decisive and conclusive of its admissibility. When\n\nthe agreement of sale dated 31.10.2007 is considered, clauses 1 to 4 under the\n\nsaid agreement would disclose that:\n\n1. The vendor hereby agree and promise to sell the schedule mentioned house property to the\npurchaser for a total sale consideration of Rs.20,50,000/-.\n\n2. That the vendor had today received a sum of Rs.15,00,000/- in cash from the purchaser\ntowards the advance sale consideration, the receipt of which the vendor herewith\nacknowledge and submit to the purchaser.\n\n3. The purchaser is already in possession of the schedule mentioned house property as tenant\nand in view of the payment of considerable big amount of advance sale consideration paid by\nthe purchaser to the vendor today, hence the vendor is today inducted the purchaser into\npossession by virtue of this agreement of sale.\n\n4. The vendor hereby agreed to execute the registration of sale deed by receiving the balance\nsale consideration whenever called by the purchaser either in the name of the purchaser or in\nthe name or names proposed by the purchaser.\n\n33. Thus, though the purchaser was in possession as a tenant, it was clearly\n\nmentioned that in lieu of receiving a sum of Rs.15,00,000/- out of total sale\n\nconsideration of Rs.20,50,000/- i.e.73% of the total sale consideration, the\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nvendor inducted the purchaser into possession of the schedule property by virtue\n\nof the agreement of sale.\n\n34. Schedule 1-\nA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899\nwhich was applicable to the\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh and Article 47-A, which was inserted by AP Act 17 of\n\n1986 with effect from 16.08.1986, refers to the stamp duty payable for sale as\n\ndefined in\nSection 54\nof Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and explanation (I) of it\n\nwould read as follows:\n\nArticle 47-A (Explanation-I) :- An agreement\nto sell followed by or evidencing delivery of\npossession of the property agreed to be sold\nshall be chargeable as a \"Sale\" under this\nArticle:\n\nProvided that, where subsequently a sale deed is\nexecuted in pursuance of an agreement of sale as\naforesaid or in pursuance of an agreement\nreferred to in Clause (b) of\nArticle 6\n, the stamp\nduty, if any, already paid or recovered on the\nagreement of sale be adjusted towards the total\nduty leviable on the sale deed.\n\n35. Thus, the recitals of the document would disclose that the purchaser was\n\ninducted into possession by virtue of the agreement of sale. As per\n\nExplanation-I of Article 47-A, when the agreement to sell was followed by\n\ndelivery of possession, the same was chargeable as a \"sale\", though a future\n\ndocument can be executed which shows that the transaction of sale is not\n\ncompleted, it shall be treated as a conveyance, as the agreement to sell was\n\nfollowed by delivery of possession.\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n36. At the time of delivering the order, the learned counsel for the petitioner\n\nfiled a citation of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nVijay Kumar Goyal (Dead) v.\n\nNeena Rani and Others\n10, wherein possession was not delivered under the\n\nagreement and it was specifically mentioned in the agreement that possession of\n\nthe disputed land in question was already with the appellant, the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt held that:\n\n\"As per Entry No. 5 (cc) of Schedule 1-A\napplicable under the State of Punjab, \"in the\ncase of agreement to sell followed by or\nevidencing delivery of possession of the\nimmovable property agreed to be sold\", the\nstamp duty is leviable under Column No. 2 of\nEntry No. 23 of Schedule 1-A. As observed\nhereinabove, the plaintiff was already in\npossession prior to the execution of the aforesaid\nagreements as per the recitals in the aforesaid\ntwo agreements. It is to be noted that even the\nplaintiff has also not sought the possession in the\nsuit filed by him and has in fact sought the\npermanent injunction restraining the defendants\nfrom interfering in the peaceful possession of\nthe plaintiff and from dispossessing or causing\nto dispossess the plaintiff from the suit property.\n\n5. In view of the above and for the reasons\nstated above, the order passed by the High Court\nand that of the Trial Court directing the\nappellant - original plaintiff to pay the deficient\nstamp duty with penalty applying Sub-column\nNo. 2 of Column No. 2 of Entry No. 23 of\nSchedule 1-A as amended by the State of Punjab\nis unsustainable and the same deserves to be\nquashed and set aside.\"\n2022 Law Suit (SC) 1104\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\n37. But in the present case, though the petitioner - plaintiff was in possession\n\nof the suit property as a tenant, but subsequently after entering into agreement\n\nof sale, it was specifically mentioned that in view of payment of substantial\n\namount of sale consideration, the vendor inducted the purchaser into possession\n\nby virtue of the agreement of sale. Thus, the possession of the petitioner was\n\nnot as a tenant, but as a purchaser by virtue of payment of substantial amount of\n\nsale consideration. The execution of conveyance deed after payment of the\n\nbalance sale consideration was a mere formality. As such, the document\n\nmarked under Ex.A1 evidencing delivery of possession of the property requires\n\nstamp duty as per Explanation (I) of Article 47-A of Schedule 1-\nA of Indian\n\nStamp Act, 1889\n.\n\n38. As such, this Court does not find any illegality or material irregularity in\n\nthe order and decree of the learned Principal District Judge, Hanumakonda in\n\nde-exhibiting the document marked as Ex.A1 and in impounding the said\n\ndocument giving a liberty to the plaintiff to get the said document of agreement\n\nof sale marked on paying deficit stamp duty and penalty as required under\n\nArticle 47-A of Schedule 1-\nA of the Indian Stamp Act, 1889\n.\n\n39. In the result, the Civil Revision Petition is dismissed confirming the order\n\nof the Principal District Judge, Hanumakonda in I.A.No.630 of 2023 in\n\nO.S.No.188 of 2022 dated 15.06.2023. No order as to costs.\nDr.GRR, J\ncrp_1769_2023\n\nAs a sequel, miscellaneous applications pending in this Revision Petition,\n\nif any, shall stand closed.\n\n____________________\nDr. G.RADHA RANI, J\nDate: 09th October, 2023\nNsk.",

THE BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE ARE THAT THE PLAINTIFF FILED A SUIT FOR SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENT OF SALE DATED 31.10.2007 AND FOR PERMANENT  INJUNCTION. THE PLAINTIFF WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE SCHEDULE PROPERTY AS A TENANT.
