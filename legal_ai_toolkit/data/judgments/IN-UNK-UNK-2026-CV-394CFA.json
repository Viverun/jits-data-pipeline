It is the case of the Petitioner that both the\nPetitioner and Opp. Party No.5 were appointed as\nGroup-D employees under the Rehabilitation\nAssistance Scheme vide order dt.19.05.2008 and both\nof them also joined on the very same date. Placing\nreliance on the guideline issued by the Government in\nthe G.A Department in its resolution dt.29.01.1997\nvide Annexure-10, and the provision contained under\nPara-6 of the said resolution, learned counsel\nappearing for the Petitioner contended that since both\nPetitioner and Opp. party No.5 joined on the same date,\nin view of the aforesaid provision, Petitioner being older\nin age, he should have been placed above Opp. party\nNo.5 in the Gradation list of Group-D employees\npublished by Opp. party No.3.

Learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner\ncontended that since Petitioner's date of birth as\nrecorded in the Service Book is 19.05.1977, and that of\nOpp. party No.5 as 01.03.1979, in view of the aforesaid\nprovision, Petitioner should have been placed above\nOpp. party No.5 in the provisional Gradation list of\nGroup-D employees published by the Office of the\nC.D.V.O on 05.10.2018 under Annexure-6.\n\n4.2. It is contended that because of such wrong\nplacement of the Petitioner vis-à-vis Opp. party No.5 in\nthe provisional Gradation list published under\nAnenxure-6, which was made final vide Annexure-7,\nPetitioner was not held eligible and entitled to get the\nbenefit of appointment as against the vacant post of\nLive Stock Inspector by Opp. Party No.3, whereas Opp.\nParty No.5 was found eligible to get the benefit. It is\naccordingly contended that since on the face of the\nprovisions contained under para-6 of the resolution\nissued under Annexure-10, Petitioner has been wrongly\nplaced below Opp. party No.5 in the Gradation list of\nGroup-D employees working under Opp. Party No.3\nand accordingly Petitioner has been deprived to get the\nbenefit of appointment on promotion to the post of Live\nStock Inspector, the said action of the Opp. Parties is\nliable to be declared as illegal, with extension of the\nbenefit in favour of the Petitioner as prayed for.\n\n Page 3 of 13\n\n // 4 //\n\n5. Learned Addl. Govt. Advocate on the other hand\nmade his submission basing on the stand taken in the\ncounter affidavit so filed by Opp. party Nos.2 & 3.\n\n5.1. It is contended that after their appointment in the\nyear 2008, in the final Gradation list of Group-D\nemployees so published by Opp. Party No.3 on\n27.12.2012 as well as 31.12.2014 under Annexure-A/3\nand B/3, Petitioner was placed below Opp. party No.5\nand at no point of time, Petitioner raised any objection\nto such placement of him below Opp. party No.5. It is\ncontended that in the Gradation list published under\nAnnexure-A/3, Petitioner while was placed at Sl. No.58,\nprivate Opp. party No.5 placed at Sl. No.57. Similarly,\nin the Gradation list published on 31.12.2014 under\nAnnexure-B/3, Petitioner was placed at Sl. No.22 and\nOpp. party No.5 at Sl. No.21.\n\n5.2. Learned Addl. Govt. Advocate accordingly\ncontended that since in the final Gradation list\npublished under Annexure-A/3 and B/3 in the year\n2012 & 2014, Petitioner was placed below Opp. party\nNo.5 and at no point of time Petitioner raised any\nobjection to such placement of him in the gradation\nlist, Petitioner is not eligible and entitled to challenge\nhis placement below Opp. party No.5 in the provisional\nGradation list published on 30.08.2018 under\nAnnexure-D/3 so finalised vide order dt.5.10.2018\nunder Annexure-6.\n\n Page 4 of 13\n\n // 5 //\n\n5.3. It is also contended that taking into account his\nposition in the final Gradation list published on\n05.10.2018 under Annexure-6, Petitioner participated\nin the selection process for his promotion to the post of\nLive Stock Inspector. Only when Petitioner failed to get\nthe benefit and Opp. party No.5 was held eligible to get\nthe same, the present Writ Petition was filed\nchallenging such action of Opp. party No.3.\n\n5.4. It is contended that since at no point of time,\nPetitioner raised any objection to his placement in the\nfinal Gradation list published in the year 2012, 2014 as\nwell the provisional gradation list published on\n30.08.2018 under Annexure-D/3 and he participated\nin the selection process, to get the benefit of promotion\nto the rank of Live Stock Inspector, Petitioner is not\npermitted to challenge his placement below Opp. Party\nNo.5, by filing the present Writ Petition in the year\n2021. It is accordingly contended that the ground on\nwhich the Writ Petition has been filed assailing the\naction of Opp. party No.3 is not acceptable. A further\nsubmission was also made that, after publication of\nProvisional Gradation list on 30.08.2018 under\nAnnexure-D/3, no objection was ever filed by the\nPetitioner to his placement and in absence of any such\nobjection, the provisional gradation list was finalised\nvide order dt.05.10.2018 under Annexure-6.\n\n Page 5 of 13\n\n // 6 //\n\n6. Similar submission was also made by Mr. B.B.\nMohanty, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Opp.\nparty No.5. It is contended that since at no point of\ntime after their appointment, Petitioner raised any\nobjection to his placement below Opp. Party No.5 in\nsuccessive Gradation lists of Group-D employees\npublished in the year 2012, 2014 and Gradation list\npublished on 31.01.2015 under Annexure-A/5 series\nand no objection was also filed to the provisional\nGradation list published on 30.08.2018 under\nAnnexure-D/3, Petitioner is not eligible and entitled to\nchallenge such placement vis-à-vis Opp. party No.5 by\nfiling the present Writ Petition in the year 2021. It is\naccordingly contended that the relief as claimed by the\nPetitioner challenging the action of Opp. party No.3 and\nthe benefit extended in favour of Opp. party No.5\ncannot be entertained.\n\n6.1. In support of his submission, Mr. B.B. Mohanty,\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of opp. Party No.5\nrelied on a decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the\ncase \nShiba Shankar Mohapatra and Others Vs.\nState of Orissa & Others\n. Hon'ble Apex Court in\npara-29 of \nthe said decision\n has held as follows:\n\n 29. Thus, in view of the above, the settled legal\n proposition that emerges is that once the seniority had\n been fixed and it remains in existence for a reasonable\n period, any challenge to the same should not be\n entertained. In K.R. Mudgal (supra), this Court has laid\n down in crystal clear words that a seniority list which\n remains in existence for 3 to 4 years unchallenged,\n should not be disturbed. Thus, 3-4 years is a reasonable\n period for challenging the seniority and in case someone\n\n Page 6 of 13\n\n // 7 //\n\n agitates the issue of seniority beyond this period, he has\n to explain the delay and laches in approaching the\n adjudicatory forum, by furnishing satisfactory\n explanation.\n\n7. To the stand taken in the counter affidavit, Mr. M.\nMishra, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner\nmade further submission basing on the stand taken in\nthe rejoinder affidavit so filed by him.\n\n7.1. It is contended that since at no point of time,\nPetitioner was intimated about his placement vis-à-vis\nOpp. party No.5 in the final gradation list published in\nthe year 2012,2014, 2015 as well as the provisional\ngradation list published on 30.08.2018 under\nAnnexure-D/3. Petitioner had no occasion to challenge\nsuch placement by filing his objection.\n\n7.2. It is also contended that provisional gradation list\npublished on 30.08.2018 under Annexure-D/3 since\nwas not brought to the knowledge of the Petitioner, he\ncould not file any objection and taking into account his\nposition in the final gradation list published on\n05.10.2018 under Annexure-6, he participated in the\nselection process to get the benefit of appointment on\npromotion to the rank of Live Stock Inspector. Only\nwhen the select list was published by placing Opp.\nparty No.5 above the Petitioner vide order\ndt.06.02.2020 under Annexure-7, Petitioner could\nknow that he has been discriminated vis-a-vis Opp.\nParty No.5 and his position has not been maintained in\nterms of resolution dt.29.01.1997 under Annexure-10.\n\n Page 7 of 13\n\n // 8 //\n\n8. Mr. M. Mishra, learned counsel appearing for the\nPetitioner in support of his submission relied on the\nfollowing decisions:\n\n \n1. \nState of Odisha & Another Vs.\nBichitrananda Mohapatra & Another,2021\n (1) OLR\n\n664\n\n \n2. \nState Of Orissa and Another Vs. Sri Dwarika\n Das Agarwalla\n, 2017(I) CLR 313\n\n 3. Krushna Chandra Sahoo Vs. Bank of India\n& Others, AIR 2009 Orissa 35\n\n8.1. This Court in the case of Bichitrananda\nMohapatra in Paragraphs-10,11,12,13 & 14 has held\nas follows:\n\n 10. Chesta Holdings Ltd. v. Kartin (1959) 3 All\n ER 666 Notice word which Involves that knowledge\n may be imparted by had to the word \"notids is not\n synonym for the word knowledge police Knowledge is\n not a condition of mind.\n\n \"Knowledge\" is the act of state of knowing, clear\n perception of fact, that which is or may be known it\n means acquaintance with things ascertained or\n ascertainable) specific information\n\n 11. In Jai Prakash v. State, JT 1991 (1) SC 228, it\n has been held that knowledge signifies a state of\n mental realization with bare state of Conscious\n awareness of certain facts in which human mind\n remains supine er inactive\n\n 12. In Arun Navalji More v. State of Maharashtra,\n (2006) 12 SCC 613, it has been held that the\n standard test of 'knowledge' is whether the person\n whose conduct is in issue either knows of the\n\n Page 8 of 13\n\n // 9 //\n\n relevant circumstances or has no substantial doubt\n of their existence.\n\n 13. In Mahadev Prasad v. Mansa Ram, AIR 2008\n Raj 206, while considering the second proviso of\n Order-IX, Rule13, the Court held that the word\n 'knowledge' occurring in second proviso of Order-IX,\n Rule-13 of the Code means the knowledge of date of\n hearing and not of 'pendency of suit'.\n\n 14. In view of the principles of law, as discussed\n above, and applying the same to the present fact, it\n is made clear that the order which was passed on\n 16.10.2019 was never brought to the notice of the\n respondent no. 1-petitioner and, therefore, there was\n no occasion on his part to file an application within\n thirty days period granted for recalling or\n modification or clarification of the order. When he\n received the certified copy on 05.02.2020. he moved\n the present application for recalling the order dated\n 16.10.2019 passed by this Court. Thus, the\n objection raised by Mr. D.K. Mohanty. learned Addl.\n\n Standing Counsel appearing for the State appellant-\n opposite parties, that since the petitioner has filed\n the application beyond thirty days period the same\n cannot be entertained, has no justification,\n particularly when the respondent no.1-petitioner\n had not appeared in the case nor had he the\n occasion to know whether such order has been\n passed by This Court nor the said order been\n communicated to him so as to file the application\n within thirty days period prescribed by this Court.\n\n8.2. This Court in the case of Sri Dwarika Das\nAgarwalla in Paragraph-18 has held as follows:\n\n \n18. Before parting with the case, this Court observes\n that for a paltry amount, the plaintiff is running from\n pillar to post since 1975. He had approached this\n Court twice earlier Had the matter been examined\n with due care and circumspection, then valuable\n Court time could have been saved. No litigant has a\n right to unlimited drought on the Court time and\n public money in order to get his affairs settled in the\n manner as he wishes. State is a virtuous litigant\n About 60 years back in the case of \nFirm Kaluram\n Sitaram v. The Dominion of India\n. AIR 1954\n BOMBAY 50, Chief Justice Chagla (as he then was)\n\n Page 9 of 13\n\n // 10 //\n\n speaking for the Bench stressed that when the State\n deals with a citizen it should not ordinarily rely on\n technicalities, and if the State is satisfied that the\n case of the citizen is a just one even though legal\n defences may be open to it, it must act, as has been\n said by eminent judges, as an honest person The\n claim of the plaintiff was denuded on jejune grounds\n\n8.3. The Apex Court in the case of Krushna Chandra\nSahoo in Paragraph-10 has held as follows:\n\n 10. When the statute provides for a particular\n procedure, the authority has to follow the same and\n cannot be permitted to act in contravention of the\n same. It has been hither to uncontroverted legal\n position that where a statute requires to do a certain\n thin in a certain way, the thing must be done in that\n way or not at all. Other methods or mode of\n performance are impliedly and necessarily forbidden.\n\n \nThe aforesaid settled legal Proposition is based on a\n legal maxim \"Expressio unius est exclusion alterius\".\n Meaning thereby that if a statute provides for a thig to\n be done in a particular, then it has to be done in that\n manner and in no other manner and following other\n course is not permissible, \nVide State of Bihar v. J.A.C\n Saldanna\n, AIR 1980 SC 3276; \nHaresh Dayaram\n Thakur V. State of Maharashtra & Others.\n, (2000) 6\n SCC 179: AIR 2000 SC 2281; \nPrabha Shankar Dubey\n v. State of Madhya Pradesh\n, \nAIR 2004 SC 486, and\n Indian Banks' Association v. Devkala Consultancy\n Service\n, AIR 2004 SC 2615.\n\n 9. Having heard learned counsel appearing for the\n parties and considering the submission made, this\n Court finds that Petitioner and Opp. party No.5, both\n were appointed under the provisions of Rehabilitation\n Assistance Scheme as Group-D employee vide order\n dt.19.05.2008 and both of them joined in the\n establishment of Opp. Party No.3 on 19.05.2008. It is\n found that subsequent to their joining as Group-D\n employees in the establishment of Opp. party No.3, in\n\n Page 10 of 13\n\n // 11 //\n\nthe final Gradation List of Group-D employee published\nin the year 2012 under Annexure-A/2, in the year\n2014, under Annexure-B/3 and in the year 2015\nunder Annexure-A/5 series, Petitioner all through was\nplaced below Opp. party No.5.\n\n9.1. Even in the provisional Gradation list published\non 30.08.2018 under Annexure-D/3, Petitioner was\nplaced below Opp. party No.5, and no objection was\never made by the Petitioner to such placement of\nPetitioner vis-à-vis Opp. party No.5. It is also found\nthat basing on the final Gradation list published on\n05.10.2018 under Annexure-6, Petitioner participated\nin the selection process to get the benefit of promotion\nto the post of Live Stock Inspector. Only when\nPetitioner came to know that because of his placement\nbelow Opp. Party No.5, Opp. Party No.5 has been held\neligible to get the benefit of promotion vide order\ndt.06.02.2020 under Annexure-7, the present Writ\nPetition was filed challenging such action of Opp. Party\nNo.3.\n\n9.2. Since after their appointment and joining on\n19.05.2008, Petitioner never raised any objection\nregarding his placement below Opp. party No.5 in the\nfinal Gradation list published in the year 2012,2014\nand 2015 as well as in the provisional Gradation list\nissued on 30.08.2018 under Annexure-D/3 as well as\nthe final gradation list published on 05.10.2018 under\n\n Page 11 of 13\n\n // 12 //\n\nAnnexure-6, it is the view of this Court that Petitioner\nhas forgone his right to be placed above Opp. party\nNo.5.\n\n9.3. Even though in terms of the resolution issued on\n29.01.1997, Petitioner is required to be placed above\nOpp. Party No.5, but since for a pretty long period\nstarting from 2012 till 2018, Petitioner never raised\nsuch a claim to be placed above Opp. party No.5, It is\nthe view of the Court that Petitioner is not permitted to\nchallenge the same. Not only that without raising any\nobjection to his placement in the final gradation list\npublished on 05.10.2018 under Annexure-6, Petitioner\ntook his chance and participated in the process of\nselection to get the benefit of promotion to the rank of\nLive Stock Inspector. Only when vide order\ndt.06.02.2020 under Annexure-7, Opp. Party No.5\ntaking into account his seniority over the Petitioner was\nplaced ahead of the Petitioner, the present Writ Petition\nwas filed.\n\n9.4. Placing reliance on the decision in the case of\nShiba Shankar Mohapatra, this Court is of the view\nthat Petitioner is not eligible and entitled to get the\nbenefit of seniority over Opp. Party No.5 as prayed for.\nThe decisions relied on by the learned counsel\nappearing for the Petitioner as per the considered view\nof this Court are not applicable to the facts of the\npresent case.\n\n Page 12 of 13\n\n // 13 //\n\n 9.5. In view of the aforesaid analysis, this Court is not\n inclined to interfere with the challenge made in the\n Writ Petition dismiss the Writ Petition.\n\n 9.6. The Writ Petition stands dismissed.\n\n (Biraja Prasanna Satapathy)\n Judge\n\n Orissa High Court, Cuttack\n Dated the 21st November, 2025 /Sangita\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nSigned by: SANGITA PATRA\n\nReason: authenticaton of order\nLocation: high court of orissa, cuttack\nDate: 25-Nov-2025 14:03:37\n\n Page 13 of 13",
