Aforesaid order passed\nby the controlling authority, Rajkot was challenged by petitioner\nbefore appellate authority, Rajkot in Appeal NO. 42 of 2009 which\ncame to be dismissed by appellate authority, Rajkot on 28.8.2009.\n\nLearned\nAdvocate Mr. Munshaw for petitioner has raised number of contentions\nbefore this Court. According to his submissions, respondent NO.1\nherein who was born on 9.5.1955 was an employee of Gujarat Housing\nBoard and joined service as work charge clerk on 13.11.1973 and was\nmade regular in service on 8.12.1983 and later on his application\nfor voluntary retirement was accepted and accordingly, he retired on\n30.6.2006. It was his submission that petitioner board was earlier\nhaving Contributory Provident Fund Scheme for its employees but\nafter careful consideration of the request of the employees, it was\nthought fit to adopt the pension scheme of the State Government and\na Circular dated 12.11.1991 was issued through which the Scheme was\nimplemented. He submitted that accordingly, provisions of Gujarat\nCivil Service Rules/Bombay Civil Service Rules are made applicable\nfor benefits to employees of petitioner board. He submitted that\nrespondent NO.1 gave his option for pension scheme and accordingly\nhis case was to be considered for calculation of pension as well as\ngratuity as provided under the Gujarat Civil Service Rules. He\nsubmitted that as per the provisions of the Gujarat Civil Service\nRules, pension includes retirement cum death gratuity and,\ntherefore, gratuity was also to be calculated accordingly. He\nsubmitted that an order dated 27.2.2008 was passed by Administrative\nOfficer of petitioner board through which respondent no.1 herein who\nretired as a junior clerk, was ordered to be paid pension on the\nbasis of his last drawn salary. In all, 31 years service was counted\nfor calculation of pension. Gratuity amounting to Rs.1,58,565/- was\ncalculated on the basis of 31 years service. Respondent No.1 who\njoined service on 13.11.1973 and retired on 30.6.2006 was granted\nbenefit of pension and gratuity on the basis of 31 years service as\nthrough orders dated 24.8.07, it was ordered that the period\ncommencing from 13.3.76 to 8.5.78 was not to be counted for the\npurpose of pension. He also submitted that the impugned orders\npassed by respondent no.3 and 2 respectively are illegal, unjust,\narbitrary and contrary to facts and evidence on record as well as\nwithout jurisdiction. He further submitted that as such, petitioner\nboard is a statutory body under total administrative control and\nsupervision of Government of Gujarat and it has accepted and adopted\nprovisions of Gujarat Civil Service Rules and policy of State. He\nsubmited that services of present respondent no.1 was counted for\nthe purpose of pension and gratuity in accordance with Gujarat\nCivil Service Rules and retirement benefits like pension and\ngratuity to its employees accordingly, in other words, the\ncalculations for payment of pension and gratuity are made as per\nprovisions of Gujarat Civil Service Rules and policy of State. He\nsubmits that services of respondent no.1 herein was counted for the\npurpose of pension and gratuity in accordance with the provisions of\nGujarat Civil Service Rules and accordingly, payment of gratuity\nwas made. It is submitted that the gratuity was not liable to be\npaid under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nand, therefore, there\nis no question of jurisdiction of respondent no.2 and 3 against the\norder of Gujarat Housing Board as said authorities have no authority\nto decide such calculation under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n.\nHe further submitted that the calculation of gratuity is made as per\nthe provisions of Gujarat Civil Service Rules and after considering\ntotal length of service of the respondent no.1 herein. It is also\nsubmitted that through orders dated 24.8.07 passed by Housing\nCommissioner, 31 years service is to be counted for the purpose of\npension and gratuity as two years service was treated as without\npay. It is also submitted that respondent no.2 and 3 have ignored\nissues like applicability of provisions of Gujarat Civil Service\nRules, issue of jurisdiction and total length of service etc. raised\nbefore the authorities and allowed application for interest at the\nrate of 10 per cent on delayed payment. It is also submitted that\nrespondent no.2 and 3 have erred in not appreciating whether\nrespondent no.1 herein was treated as Government servant for the\npurpose of benefit of pension and gratuity and grievance, if any, is\nrepresented before appropriate authority. It is submitted that in\ncase of delayed payment, interest at the rate of 6 per cent is\nrequired to be paid. It is also submitted that respondent no.1 has\nnot challenged orders passed by Gujarat Housing Board through which\nit is decided that in all 31 years service is to be calculated for\npurpose of pension and gratuity and has become final and conclusive.\nIn view of this, respondent no.2 and 3 have no authority to order to\ncalculate pension and gratuity on the basis of 33 years. It is\nsubmitted that wrong calculation by any incompetent authority would\nnot only result into heavy burden to the public exchequer but also\nset a bad precedent as the respondent no.1 herein is not eligible\nand entitled for payment of gratuity under the provisions of the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n. In light of aforesaid contentions\nraised by learned Advocate MR. Munshaw and considering draft\namendment which has been placed on record and granted by this court\non 22nd February, 2010, it is submitted that pension\nscheme being package, it includes amount of gratuity which has been\naccepted by respondent no.1 and thereafter, raising of dispute and\ndisputing amount of gratuity paid by petitioner is amounting to\ncommitting breach of undertaking given by respondent no.1 and same\nis contrary to package scheme of petitioner. Petitioner has placed\non record by way of draft amendment, certain documents which would\ngo to suggest that pension scheme has been accepted by petitioner\nboard and accordingly, options were invited from concerned employees\nand such option was exercised by present respondent and on that\nbasis, pension amount has been paid by respondent no.1 as well as\namount of gratuity which is part of pension scheme paid and yet,\nrespondent no.1 has disputed amount of gratuity and claimed amount\nof gratuity under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, for that, according\nto him, respondent no.1 is not entitled and respondent is entitled\nto amount of grauity only under the pension scheme which has been\naccepted by respondent no.1 and, therefore, this aspect has not been\nproperly considered by controlling authority as well as appellate\nauthority and, therefore, this petition has been filed by petitioner\nbefore this Court. Except these submissions, no other submission is\nmade by learned Advocate Mr. HS Munshaw before this Court.\n\nI\nhave considered submissions made by learned Advocate Mr. Munshaw\nbefore this court. I have also perused order passed by controlling\nauthority as well as order passed by appellate authority wherein\norder passed by controlling authority has been confirmed by\ndismissing appeal preferred by petitioner.\n\nIt\nis necessary to consider relevant provisions of\nPayment of Gratuity\nAct, 1972\n. Provisions of said Act are applicable to petitioner\nestablishment as per\nsection 1 (3) (b)\nand (c) and this fact has not\nbeen disputed by learned Advocate Mr. Munshaw before this Court. Not\nonly that but this fact has also not been disputed by petitioner\neither before controlling authority or appellate authority under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nand, therefore, Act is made applicable to\npetitioner establishment.\nSection 4\nsub section (5) of said Act\nprovides that nothing in this section shall affect the right of an\nemployee to receive better terms of gratuity under any award or\nagreement or contract with the employer.\nSection 5\nof Act is giving\npower to appropriate Government by notification and subject to such\nconditions as may be specified in notification to exempt any\nestablishment, factory, mine, oilfield, plantation, port, railway\ncompany or shop to which this Act applies from operation of\nprovisions of this Act if, in the opinion of appropriate Government,\nthe employees of such establishment as aforesaid are in receipt of\ngratuity or pensionary benefits not less favourable than the\nbenefits conferred under this Act. Sub section (3) of\nsection 5\nof\nAct provides that a notification issued under sub-section (1) or sub\nsection (2) may be issued retrospectively a date not earlier than\nthe date of commencement of the Act but no such notification shall\nbe issued so as to prejudicially affect the interests of any person.\nIt is not disputed by petitioner that petitioner establishment has\nnot been exempted by appropriate Government under\nsection 5\nand\nconcerned employee is also not exempted under sub section (2) of\n\nsection 5\nof the Act. As per\nsection 14\nof this Act, provisions of\nthis Act or any rule made thereunder shall have effect\nnotwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any\nenactment other than this Act or in any instrument or contract\nhaving effect by virtue of any enactment other than by this Act.\nAforesaid provisions of the\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nare\nmandatory in nature and same are relevant for deciding issue which\nhas been raised by learned Advocate Mr. Munshaw for petitioner\nbefore this Court.\n\nPension\nscheme which has been accepted by respondent no.1 includes benefit\nof gratuity but amount of gratuity is less favourable than the claim\nmade under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, therefore, respondent\nworkman is entitled to claim such benefit as per the provisions of\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\n. This being statutory right available\nto respondent workman, it has been rightly examined by controlling\nauthority after considering last drawn salary of employee and\nrespondent is also covered by definition of\nsection 2(e)\nof Payment\nof Gratuity Act, 1972. Continuity of service as defined under\n\nsection 2(c)\nof Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has also been rightly\nconsidered by Controlling Authority and Appellate Authority under\nthe\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nand provisions of said Act are\napplicable to petitioner establishment and last drawn salary\nRs.10230.00 divided by 26 and then to find out one day salary and on\nthat basis amount of gratuity has been calculated by controlling\nauthority considering total 33 years service,for that, employee is\nentitled for wages of days as claim of gratuity and accordingly\norder has been passed by controlling authority and same aspects were\nrightly considered by appellate authority and appellate authority\nhas rightly come to conclusion that controlling authority has\nrightly passed order and it requires no interference. Appellate\nauthority has rightly come to conclusion that under\nsection 2 (4)\n,\npetitioner being commercial establishment, provisions of\nPayment of\nGratuity Act, 1972\nwould apply. Appellate authority has relied upon\ndecision of this Court reported in case of Jayaben Suryakant Modi\nand others versus Gujarat Labour Welfare Boad and others, 1997 Lab\nIC 2581 wherein it has been held that provisions of\nGratuity Act\nare\napplicable to Labour Welfare Board considering it a commercial\nestablishment as per\nsection 2(4)\nof the Act. Considering activity\nof petitioner establishment of construction of house and sale\nthereof on hire purchase basis, petitioner establishment has been\nheld to be commercial establishment.\n\nThis\nCourt had an occasion to consider same question in group of\npetitions being Special Civil Application NO. 2138 of 2002 and other\nallied matters decided by this court on 27.2.2002. Relevant\ndiscussion made by this Court in para 14 to 21 of said decision of\nthis court dated 27.2.2002 is quoted as under:\n\n14. However,\nother contention raised by learned advocate Ms.Jhaveri is in respect\nto Rules framed by the Nagarpalika, which has been sanctioned by the\nGovernment of Guajrat, while exercising power under\nSection 271(a)\n\nof the Gujarat Municipalities Act,1963. Accordingly, she relied upon\nRule-5 which for the purpose of calculation of gratuity only basic\npay as defined under BCSR Rules will be taken into account exclusive\nof dearness allowance. The gratuity will be paid on the basis of the\naverage of last 12 months pay preceding the date of the relieve\nfrom service. The contention is that because the concerned employee\nis governed by BCSR Rules and Gratuity Rules as referred above,\nprovisions of the Act are not applicable.\nThe Himachal Pradesh High\nCourt has considered this aspect in the case of\nState of Himachal\nPradesh v. Lashkari Ram\n\nreported in 2008-I-LLJ-137 wherein after considering the\ndefinition of \"employee\" under\nSection 2(e)\nof the Act and\nafter considering the Central Civil Services Rules (Pension),1972\nand employee having worked in different capacity, was held to be\nentitled to get benefits of\nGratuity Act\nas well as Civil Service\nRule (Pension) Rules.\nWhether Rules prevailed or the Act, that\nquestion was also examined by the Apex Court in case of Jashwant\nSingh Gill (supra). The Apex Court has considered the Rules framed\nby the Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. are not statutory rules and they have\nbeen made by the holding company of respondent No.1.\nThe Payment of\nGratuity Act\nwas enacted with a view to provide for a scheme for\npayment of gratuity to the employees engaged inter alia in mines.\n\nThe Act\nprovides for close - knit scheme providing for payment of\ngratuity. It is a complete code containing detailed provisions\ncovering the essential provisions of a scheme for a gratuity. It not\nonly creates a right to payment of gratuity but also lays down the\nprinciples for quantification thereof as also the conditions on\nwhich he may be denied therefrom. A statutory right accrued, thus,\ncannot be impaired by reason of a rule which does not have the force\nof a statute. The provisions of the Act, therefore, must prevail\nover the Rules.\n\n15. In\naforesaid decision, there were no statutory rules but, in facts of\nthis case, there may be statutory rules. The Apex Court has\nconsidered similar aspect in case of\nEid\nParry (I) Ltd. v. G. Omkar Murthy and Others\nreported in 2001 (4)\nSCC 68. Relevant observations made in Para.2, 3 and 4 are quoted as\nunder :\n\n\"2. Four\ncontentions are put forth before us, namely, that\n\n(i)\nThe Central Act prevails over the State Act by virtue of\nArticle 254\n\nof the Constitution and Section 40(3) is invalid and the claims are\nunsustainable;\n\n(ii)\nSection 40(3) of the State Act stood repealed on the coming into\nforce of the\nAndhra Pradesh Shops and Establishments Act, 1988\nand\ngratuity became payable under Section 47(5) of the State Act where\npayment of gratuity is not payable under the Central Act;\n\n(iii)\nSection 14 of the Central Act overrides other enactments in relation\nto gratuity, and\n\n(iv) The respondents have\nbeen paid gratuity under the Central Act for the period covered and\nfor the balance period of service gratuity is paid under the\nprevailing trust scheme.\n\nAt\nthe relevant time when the respondents voluntarily\nretired from service the definition of 'employee' under Section 2(e)\nof the Central Act read as not to include employee whose wages\nexceeded Rs. 1,000/- per mensem while the respondents-employees were\nall getting wages more than Rs. 1,600/- per mensem and, therefore,\nthe Central Act could not be applied. If that is so, it is certainly\npermissible for the respondents to have made an application for\npayment of gratuity under Section 40(3) of the State Act. Further\nthe scheme of the Central Act would indicate that it would not be\napplicable in cases where the State Act is more beneficial than the\nCentral Act. In this case, the finding is that the State Act is more\nbeneficial than the Central Act. Therefore, the contentions sought\nto be advanced on behalf of the appellant as to repugnancy or\notherwise of the State Act would not arise at all. If both the\nenactments can co-exist and can operate where one Act or the other\nis not available then we find no difficulty in making the State Act\napplicable on the fact situation available as has been done in the\npresent case. Therefore, we find that the contentions raised on\nbehalf of the appellant are unsustainable.\n\n3.\nShri Narayan B. Shetye, the learned Senior Advocate appearing for\nthe appellant, submitted that the Central Act is a complete Code\ncontaining detailed provisions and creates right\nof payment of gratuity and, therefore, the Central Act should\nprevail over the State Act. Reliance has been placed on the decision\nof this Court in\nState of Punjab v. Labour\nCourt, Jullundur, (1980)\n1 SCR 953 : (AIR 1979 SC 1981 : 1980 Lab IC 1084). In that case the\nissue before the Court was whether for payment of gratuity an\napplication could be made under\nSection 33-C(2)\nof the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947, and\nit was held that such an application could not be filed under the\nsaid Act. Therefore, this decision cannot be of any assistance to\nthe appellant inasmuch as the question before us is whether the\nCentral Act or the State Act would apply for payment of gratuity.\n\n4. The decision in M.S.R.\nMurthy v. Arya Somayajula Yagneswara Chenulu, 1985 Lab IC 189 (Andh\nPra) also is of no use to the appellant inasmuch as the State Act is\nheld not to operate to the extent the Central Act prevails. In the\npresent case, on facts, it is found that the Central Act is not\napplicable.\"\n\n15.1 In\naforesaid two decisions, the Apex Court has considered the fact that\neven when statutory rules are available, the provisions of the Act\nprevail. Therefore, in this case though services rules may be\nstatutory, considering\nSection 14\nof the Act, provisions of the Act\nshould prevail.\n\n16. The contention raised\nby learned advocate Ms.Jhaveri that\nGratuity Act\nis not applicable to\nthe Nagarpalika being the local authority, cannot be accepted as the\nNagarpalika is covered by definition of 'establishment' and the\nprovisions of the\nGratuity Act\nare applicable.\nSection 1(3)(b)\nof the\nAct wherein definition 'establishment' is provided, which reads,\nthus,\n\n\"every shop or\nestablishment within the meaning of any law for the time being in\nforce in relation to shops and establishment in a State, in which ten\nor more persons are employed, or were employed, on any day of the\npreceding twelve months.\"\n\n16.1 The aforesaid\ncontention is not accepted because the local authority being an\nestablishment covered under the\nGratuity Act, the Gratuity Act\nis\napplicable as has been held by the Madras High Court in\ncase of\nCommissioner, Sathyamangalam Municipality v. Deputy\nCommissioner of Labour (Appellate Authority\nunder\nPayment of Gratuity\nAct\n), Salem and others reported in 2004 III LLJ 995 wherein\nit has been observed by the Madras High Court that, \"\nPayment of\nGratuity Act,1972\n-\nSecs.2(e)\n,\nand\n(3-A)- Local authority also\nestablished liable under Act to pay gratuity - Award of interest to\nemployee for period after expiry of 30 days from retirement, held\nproper.\n\nEven the Panchayat is also considered to be an\nestablishment under the provisions of the\nGratuity Act and the Act\nis\napplicable as decided by Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of\n\nS.N.Verma v. State of M.P. and others\nreported in 2004-I-LLJ-560.\nRelevant observations in the aforesaid decision is in Para.6 which is\nquoted as under :\n\n\"6. Thus the\nPanchayat is indisputedly a 'local body' and if it is employing more\nthan ten persons it would be an 'establishment' within the meaning\nof the notification given above. An employee of an Panchayat is\nentitled to the payment of gratuity as per provisions of\nPayment of\nGratuity Act,1972\nunless under any other rule of the Panchayat or the\nState Government he has a right to receive 'better terms of gratuity\"\n\nas per\nSection 4(5)\nof the Act. Though there is an observation in the\njudgment dated June 27, 1997 in W.P.No.1743 of 1997 that the gratuity\nis payable to the Panchayat employees as per Madhya Pradesh Janpad\nPanchayat Employees (Qualifications, Recruitment and Conditions of\nService) Rules,1976, on a perusal of these rules it is conceded that\nthere is no provision in these rules for payment of gratuity. In such\na situation an employee of the Panchayat would be entitled to\ngratuity as per\nPayment of Gratuity Act,1972\n. The Supreme Court has\nheld in\nBakshish Singh v. Darshan Engineering Works\n, AIR 1994 SC 251\n: 1994 (1) SSC 9 : 1994-I-LLJ-197 that the provisions for payment of\ngratuity contained in\nSection 4(1)(b)\nof the Act are one of the\nminimal service conditions, which must be made available to the\nemployees notwithstanding the financial capacity of the employer to\nbear its burden. It is settled law that the establishments which\nhave no capacity to give to their workmen the minimum conditions of\nservice prescribed by the statute have no right to exist. The\nrespondent Janpad Panchayat is admittedly employing more than ten\npersons and therefore the petitioner who was its employee is entitled\nto gratuity under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act,1972\n.\"\n\n16.2 The\nDelhi High Court in case of\nMunicipal Corporation of Delhi\nv. Smt. V.T.Naresh and Anr.\nreported in 1986-I-LLJ-323 relying\nupon the decision of Apex Court in case of\nState\nof Punjab v. Labour\nCourt of Jullundur and others reported\nin 1981-I-LLJ- 354, it is held that a Corporation and/or local\nauthority like Municipal Commissioner of Delhi is an establishment\ngoverned by\nPayment of Gratuity Act,1972\n. The word \"establishment'\nin the\nGratuity Act\nis not controlled by any type of establishment\nand it will include commercial, public sector establishment.\"\nRelevant observations in the aforesaid decisions are in Para.6 and 7\nwhich are quoted as under :\n\n\"6. It will be\nnoticed that the word \"establishment\" used in the aforesaid\nclause of\nPayment of Gratuity Act,1972\nis not controlled by any type\nof establishment. It will include commercial, public sector\nestablishment, private sector establishment as also the\nnon-commercial establishment. Therefore, it is merely because\nMunicipal Corporation of Delhi which is created by\nDelhi Municipal\nCorporation Act,1957\nis also a local body or local authority, it does\nnot mean that the Corporation will not be an \"establishment\"\n\nso long as it is so in relation to any law relating to\n\"establishment\". It need not multiply the instances. Only\none is sufficient to make the Act applicable. I have, thus, no doubt\nthat the Municipal Corporation of Delhi is an \"establishment\"\nwithin the meaning of\nS.1\n, Sub-s.(3) Cl.(b) of the Act.\n\n7. Coming to the second\npoint, even if Municipal Corporation of Delhi has certain schemes, it\nis no bar to the applicability of the employees of the petitioner -\nCorporation. It is only common which can be said that an employee\ncannot have benefit of both under\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nas well as\nscheme of regulations/pension framed by the Corporation but if he has\navailed of the benefit under\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, to that extent\nbenefit will be denied to him under the regulations/pension scheme\nframed by the Corporation. If the scheme framed by the Corporation\ngives higher benefit to the extent the employee obtains benefit under\nthe \"\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, to that extent those benefits will\nbe adjusted while claiming benefit under the Scheme of\nRegulations/pensions framed by the Corporation. The employee cannot\nhave complete benefit under both the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nas well\nas under the Scheme of regulations/pensions. To the extent the\nbenefit has been granted to him under the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n,\nonly to that extent the benefit will be adjusted while enforcing the\nscheme of regulations/pension framed by the Corporation. Similarly,\nif under a Scheme framed by the Corporation the benefit is less than\nthat which is available in the\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, the employee\nwill be entitled to claim difference under the\nPayment of Gratuity\nAct\n. No other point was argued. The petition, therefore, fails and is\ndismissed. Since nobody has put in appearance on behalf of the\nrespondent, parties are left to bear their own costs.\"\n\n17. The Allahabad High\nCourt in case of Nagar Palika, Moradabad v. Appellate Authority and\nAdditional Labour Commissioner, U.P. Kanpur & others, reported in\n1990-II-LLJ-156, it has been held that municipal board is an\n'establishment' governed by the\nPayment of Gratuity Act,1972\n.\nRelevant observations of the said decision are in Para.8, 9 and 10\nwhich are quoted as under :\n\n\"8. Sub.Sec.(3) of\n\nS.1\nlays down that the provisions of the Act are to apply to every\nestablishment in which 10 or more persons are employed.\n\n9. The argument sought to\nbe advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the\nMunicipal Board cannot be described as an 'establishment' because the\nword 'establishment' connotes some business institution or atleast it\nmay include a public institution. Such a definition of a word\n'establishment' is to be found in Black's Legal Dictionary.\n\n10. I am afraid the\nargument is not sustainable. The activities which are carried on by\nthe Municipal Board do go to make it a public institution\nundoubtedly. In fact, Municipal Board, or for that matter, such local\nbodies do exist to cater to the needs of the general public and,\ntherefore, many statutory duties have been conferred upon such\nbodies. To say that in spite of those functions which have to be\ncarried out by those institutions in accordance with the mandate of\nlaw, those do not become public institutions is too bald an argument\nto be accepted.\"\n\n18. This Court has, in\ncase of\nDabhoi Nagarpalika and Anr. v. S.J.Khedia and Anr.\n\n1996 II CLR 910, held that\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nis applicable\nto the Nagarpalika.\n\n19. The Karnataka High\nCourt in case of\nManagement of Sir Venkataramana Temple and Sri Hale\nMariyamma Temple, Kapu, Udupi District v. Deputy Labour Commissioner\nand the Appellate Authority\nunder the\nPayment of Gratuity Act,1972\n,\nHassan Region, and Others reported in 2008-I-LLJ-122, has observed in\nPara.12 and 14 as under :\n\n\"12. On these rival\ncontentions and on a further examination of the case-law, it is clear\nthat the word 'establishment' in\nSection 1(3)(b)\nof the Payment of\nGratuity Act,1972 is not to be restricted as referring to 'commercial\nestablishments' alone.\nThe Act\nhas been held to apply even to\ninstitutions which were exempted under the\nShops and Establishments\nAct\n(see :\nPrincipal, Bhartiya Mahavidalaya, Amravati and Another v.\nRamakrishna Wasudeo Lahudkar 1994-II-LLJ-556 (Bom.\n). There is no\ndoubt that a liberal construction has to be given to the expression\nand any institution or organization where systematic activity is\ncarried on, by employing ten or more persons, would fall within the\nambit of the provision.\n\n14. The further contention\nthat the employee ought to have had recourse to remedies prescribed\nunder the provisions of KHRI and CE Act is also not tenable. The\nemployee is certainly entitled to elect his remedy, in the absence of\na bar.\"\n\n20. The Karnataka High\nCourt has, in case of\nRatnakar Rao U. v.

The Andhra Pradesh\nHigh Court has, in case of\nLife Insurance Corporation of India,\nHyderabad v. Regional Labour Commissioner (Central), Hyderabad and\nothers\nreported in 2000-II-LLJ-1462, in Para.10, observed as under :\n\n\"10. A reference to\nthe provisions of\nSections 2(e)\n,\n,\nand\nleads to an irresistible\nconclusion that either\nSection 48(2B)\nof the LIC Act or the LIC Rules\nfor Class-I Officers do not take away the right of an employee to\nclaim the benefit under the provisions of the Act. Indeed,\nsub-section (5) of\nSection 4\nprovides that an employee is entitled to\nbetter terms of gratuity other than the gratuity payable under\nsub-section (2) of\nSection 4\nand\nSection 5\nenables the appropriate\nGovernment to exempt any establishment from the operation of the Act\nonly if the gratuity payable by the LIC is more favourable to the\nemployees than the benefits under the Act.\"\n\nAforesaid\ndecision was challenged before Division Bench of this Court by\nBilimora Nagarpalika by filing Letters Patent Appeal NO. 379 of 2008\nwhich is reported in 2008(2) GLH 448. Division Bench of this Court\ndecided group of appeals and observed as under in para 5,6 and 7:\n\n5. We\nare unable to accept the contention raised by Ms. Jhaveri.\nSection\n2(f)\nof the Act of 1972 defines employer. Sub-clause (ii) of\nthe said clause (f) expressly includes the local authority\nwithin the meaning of the word employer.\nSection 4(1)\nof the Act of\n1972 enjoins the employer to pay gratuity to its employee on\ntermination of employment after he renders continuous service for\nnot less than five years, inter alia,\non his superannuation or on his retirement. Thus, the Municipality\nis under obligation to pay gratuity to its retired employees in\naccordance with the Act of 1972.\n\n6.\nSection\nof the Act of 1972 empowers the appropriate Government to exempt\nany establishment, etc. to which the Act applies, from the operation\nof the provision of the Act of 1972. In other words, unless an\nestablishment is expressly exempted by the appropriate Government by\nnotification issued under\nsection 5\nof the Act of 1972, such\nestablishment would be liable to pay gratuity to its retired\nemployees in accordance with the Act of 1972. It was not the case of\nthe Municipality before the controlling authority or before the\nlearned Single\nJudge or before us that the Municipality is exempted from the\noperation of the provisions of the Act of 1972 as envisaged by\n\nsection 5\nof that Act. In absence of the exemption specifically\ngranted under\nsection 5\n, the Municipality is duty bound to pay its\nemployees gratuity in accordance with the Act of 1972.\n\n7. In\nabove view of the matter, the order of the learned Single Judge does\nnot warrant interference. The Appeals are dismissed in limine. Civil\nApplications stand disposed of.\n\nLearned\nAdvocate Mr. Munshaw has relied upon decision of apex court in case\nof Beed District Central Coop. Bank Ltd. Verseus State of\nMaharashtra and others, (2006) 8 SCC 514. Relevant\npara 14 which is relied upon by learned Advocate Mr. Munshaw is\nreproduced as under:\n\n14. Applying\nthe `Golden Rule of Interpretation of Statute', to us it appears\nthat the question should be considered from the point of view of the\nnature of the scheme as also the fact that the parties agreed to the\nterms thereof. When better terms are offered, a workman takes it as\na part of the package. He may volunteer therefor, he may not.\n\nSub-Section (5)\nof\nSection 4\nof the 1972 Act provides for a right in favour of the\nworkman. Such a right may be exercised by the workman concerned. He\nneed not necessarily do it. It is the right of individual workman\nand not all the workmen. When the expression \"terms\" has\nbeen used, ordinarily it must mean \"all the terms of the\ncontract\". While interpreting even a beneficent statute, like,\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\n, we are of the opinion that either contract\nhas to be given effect to or the statute. The provisions of the Act\nenvisage for one scheme. It could not be segregated. Sub-Section (5)\nof\nSection 4\nof the 1972 Act does not contemplate that the workman\nwould be at liberty to opt for better terms of the contract, while\nkeeping the option open in respect of a part of the statute.\nWhile-reserving his right to opt for the beneficent provisions of\nthe statute or the agreement,\nhe has to opt for either of them and not the best of the terms of\nthe statute as well as those of the contract. He cannot have both.\nIf such an interpretation is given, the spirit of the Act shall be\nlost. Even in Shin Satellite (supra), this Court stated :\n\n\"The\nproper test for deciding validity or otherwise of an agreement or\norder is \"substantial severability\" and not \"textual\ndivisibility\". It is the duty of the court to sever and\nseparate trivial or technical parts by retaining the main or\nsubstantial part and by giving effect to the atter if it is legal,\nlawful and otherwise enforceable. In such cases, the court must\nconsider the question whether the parties could have agreed on the\nvalid terms of the agreement had they known that the other terms\nwere invalid or unlawful. If the answer to the said question is in\nthe affirmative, the doctrine of severability would apply and the\nvalid terms of the\nagreement could be enforced, ignoring invalid terms. To hold\notherwise would be\n\n\"to expose the\ncovenanter to the almost inevitable risk of litigation which in nine\ncases out of ten he is very ill-able to afford, should he venture to\nact upon his own opinion as to how far the restraint upon him would\nbe held by the court to be reasonable, while it may give the\ncovenantee the full benefit of unreasonable provisions if the\ncovenanter is unable to face litigation.\"\n\nRecently,\nthis aspect has been examined by apex court in case of Allahabad\nBank and anotehr versus All India Allahabad Bank Retired Employees\nAssociation,(2010) 2 SCC 44. Identical question has been\nexamined and it has been held that pension and gratuity are two\nseparate elements of retirement benefits. Apex court considered same\naspect of interpretation of statutes, liberal construction to be\ngiven having regard to directive principles of\nState Policy and\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nheld to be welfare legislation\ndeserving liberal interpretation as discussed in para 13 to 22.\nTherefore, para 13 to 22 are quoted as under:\n\n13.\nSection\nconfers power upon the appropriate Government to exempt any\nestablishment, factory, mine, oilfield, plantation etc. from the\noperation of the provisions of the Act, if, in its opinion, the\nemployees in such establishment, factory etc. are in receipt of\ngratuity or pensionary benefits not less favourable than the\nbenefits conferred under the Act. The power to exempt conferred upon\nthe appropriate Government is not an unconditional power. The\nappropriate Government is required to hear all the persons concerned\nwho are likely to be affected by the decision to be taken and the\nexemption itself is subject to the conditions mentioned in the\nprovisions of the Act namely that employee or class of employees in\nthe opinion of the government are in receipt of gratuity or\npensionary benefits not less favourable than the benefits conferred\nunder the Act.\n\n14. A\nplain reading of the provisions referred to herein above makes it\nabundantly clear that there is no escape from payment of gratuity\nunder the provisions of the Act unless the establishment is granted\nexemption from the operation of\nthe provisions of the Act by the appropriate Government.\n\n15. Notwithstanding\nthe subsequent improvements and embellishments the stand taken by\nthe bank was and is before us that the members of the Association\nhad accepted the Contributory Provident Fund Scheme and they opted\nfor pension in lieu of gratuity which was being paid and therefore\nare not entitled to payment of gratuity under the provisions of the\nAct.\n\n16. We\nshall proceed to examine the point urged by the learned counsel for\nthe appellant. Remedial statutes, in contra distinction to penal\nstatutes, are known as welfare, beneficient or social justice\noriented legislations. Such welfare statutes always receive a\nliberal construction. They are required to be so construed so as to\nsecure the relief contemplated by the statute. It is well settled\nand needs no restatement at our hands that labour and welfare\nlegislation have to be broadly and liberally construed having due\nregard to the Directive Principles of State Policy.\nThe Act\nwith\nwhich we are concerned for the present is undoubtedly one\nsuch welfare oriented legislation meant to confer certain benefits\nupon the employees working in various establishments in the country.\n\n17. Krishna\nIyer, J in\nSom Prakash Rekhi Vs. Union of India1\nstated the\nprinciple in his inimitable style that benignant provision must\nreceive a benignant construction and, even if two interpretations\nare permissible, that which furthers the beneficial object should be\npreferred. It has been further observed: (SCC pp.483-84, para 66)\n\n\"We\nlive in a welfare State, in a \"socialist\" republic, under\na Constitution with profound concern for the weaker classes\nincluding workers (Part IV). Welfare benefits such as pensions,\npayment of provident fund and gratuity are in fulfilment of the\nDirective Principles. The payment of gratuity or provident fund\nshould not occasion any deduction from the pension\nas a \"set-off\". Otherwise, the solemn statutory provisions\nensuring provident fund and gratuity become illusory. Pensions are\npaid out of regard for past meritorious services. The root of\ngratuity and the foundation of provident fund are different. Each\none is a salutary benefaction statutorily guaranteed independently\nof the other. Even assuming that by private treaty parties had\notherwise agreed to deductions before the coming into force of these\nbeneficial enactments they cannot now be deprivatory. It is\nprecisely to guard against such mischief that the non obstante and\noverriding provisions are engrafted on these statutes.\"\n\n18.\nInterpreting\nthe provisions of the said Act this Court in\nSudhir Chandra Sarkar\nVs. Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd.2\nobserved that pension and\ngratuity coupled with contributory provident fund are well\nrecognised retiral benefits governed by various statutes. These\nstatutes are legislative responses to the developing notions of the\nfair and humane conditions of work, being the promise of Part IV of\nthe Constitution. It was observed: (SCC p.380, para 15)\n\n\"15...the\nfundamental principle underlying gratuity is that it is a retirement\nbenefit for long service as a provision for old age. Demands of\nsocial security and social justice made it necessary to provide for\npayment of gratuity. On the enactment of\nPayment of Gratuity Act,\na statutory liability was cast on the employer to pay\ngratuity.\"\n\n19. Gratuity\npayable to an employee on the termination of his employment after\nrendering continuous service for not less than 5 years and on\nsuperannuation or retirement or resignation etc. being a statutory\nright cannot be taken away except in accordance with the provisions\nof the Act whereunder an exemption from such payment may be granted\nonly by the appropriate Government under\nSection 5\nof the Act which\nitself is a conditional power. No exemption could be granted by any\nGovernment unless it is established that the employees are in\nreceipt of gratuity or pension benefits which are more favourable\nthan the benefits conferred under the Act.\n\n20.\nIn\n\nUnion of India Vs All India Services Pensioners' Association And\nAnother3\n, this Court explained that there is always a\ndistinction between the pension payable on retirement and the\ngratuity payable on retirement.\n\n\"8. While pension is payable\nperiodically as long as the pensioner is alive, gratuity is\nordinarily paid only once on retirement.\"\n\n21. No\ndecision of this Court which has taken a view contrary to the\ndecisions referred to herein above has been brought to our notice.\n\n22. In\nour considered opinion pensionary benefits or the retirement\nbenefits as the case may be whether governed by a Scheme or Rules\nmay be a package consisting of payment of pension and as well as\ngratuity. Pensionary benefits may include payment of pension as well\nas gratuity. One does not exclude the other. Only in cases where the\ngratuity component in such pension schemes is in better terms in\ncomparison to that of what an employee may get under the\n\nPayment of Gratuity Act\nthe government may grant an\nexemption and relieve the employer from the statutory obligation of\npayment of gratuity.\n\nIn\nview of aforesaid decision of apex court and considering contentions\nraised by learned Advocate Mr. Munshaw, according to my opinion,\nsuch contentions cannot be accepted by this court because there is\nno exemption given to petitioner establishment by appropriate\nGovernment from operation of\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nand\nrespondent no.1 is an employee as defined under\nsection 2(e)\nof said\nAct. There is no dispute raised by petitioner before controlling\nauthority or appellate authority or before this court about\napplicability of said Act and pension and gratuity both are separate\nand independent scheme for retirement benefits and it cannot be\nconsidered to be one package policy as contended by learned Advocate\nMr. Munshaw and, therefore, in view of that, contentions raised by\nlearned Advocate Mr. Munshaw are rejected. View taken by controlling\nauthority and appellate authority is perfectly justified and\ntherefore, this petition does not call for any interference in\nexercising power under\nArticle 227\nof Constitution of India by this\ncourt. Therefore, according to my opinion, there is no substance in\nthis petition and same is therefore dismissed.\n\nIt\nis directed to controlling authority concerned to pay amount\ndeposited by petitioner at the time of filing of an appeal before\nAppellate Authority by way of account payee cheque in name of\nNatvarlal Jagjivan Madia after proper verification, immediately and\nwithout any delay.\n\n(H.K.Rathod,J.)\n\nVyas\n\nTop",
