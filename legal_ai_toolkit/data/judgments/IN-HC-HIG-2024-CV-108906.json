Since the petitioners in the aforesaid petitions are working in the\nsame office and filed the petitions with regard to their seniority and\npromotion, they are being heard and decided by this common\norder.\n\n2. In WPS No. 885 of 2015- By way of the instant petition, the\npetitioner- Prateek Khare is challenging the legality, validity and\nproprietary of the order dated 04.03.2015 (Annexure P/1) and\n30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) passed by the State Government,\nwhereby the objection raised by the petitioner in respect of\nprovisional gradation list of Joint Director issued on 25.10.2007\nand 22.11.2010 has been turned down.\n\n3. Brief facts of the case as mentioned in WPS No. 885/2015 are that\nthe petitioner- Prateek Khare is holding the post of joint Director\nand at present posted as Secretary, State Commission for\nprotection of Child Rights. The petitioner was initially appointed on\nthe post of District Women & Child Development officer vide order\ndated 18.05.1995 (Annexure P/3) and thereafter he was promoted\non the post of Deputy Director on 25.04.1998 (Annexure P/4) and\nhe was further promoted on the post of Joint Director vide order\ndated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5) and is entitled for further\npromotion to the post of Additional Director.

The case of the\npetitioner and respondents No. 5 & 6 was recommended by the\nDepartment for promotion to the post of Joint Director. The\nDepartmental Promotion Committee was convened on 21.11.2005\nfor promotion of Deputy Director to the post of Joint Director. On\nthe basis of the overall services records, the petitioner was graded\nby the Departmental Promotion Committee as Outstanding and\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nrespondents No. 5 & 6 were graded by the Departmental\nPromotion Committee as Very-Good and according to Rule 7.9 of\npromotion Rules of 2003, the petitioner was placed at serial No.1\nand the respondents no 5 & 6 were placed at serial Nos. 2 & 3.\nThe copy of the Departmental Promotion Committee proceedings\nis annexed as Annexure P/6. The General Administration\nDepartment in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to\n\nArticle 309\nread with\nArticles 16\nand\nof the Constitution of\nIndia has made the rules known as Chhattisgarh Public Services\n(Promotion) Rules, 2003, Rule 7 of the said Rules deals with\npromotion on the basis of merit-cum-seniority.\n\n4. The promotion order was issued on 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5)\nand the petitioner was placed at serial No. 1 i.e. in the same order\nof merit determined by the Departmental Promotion Committee.\nOn 25.10.2007 (Annexure P/9), first time the provisional gradation\nlist showing the position as on 01.04.2007 of Joint Directors\nWomen & Child Welfare Department was published and the\nobjections were invited. In the said gradation list, petitioner was\nplaced at serial No.3 and respondents No. 5 & 6 were placed\nabove the petitioner ignoring the order of merit determined by\nDepartmental Promotion Committee on the basis of overall merit.\nOn 03.11.2007, the petitioner made first representation for\ncorrection of his position. On 17.12.2009, second representation\nwas made, on 21.12.2009, third representation was made, further\non 30.12.2009 and thereafter on 22.11.2010 the last\nrepresentation was made. From 2007 to 2010, the final gradation\nlist was not published and the objection of the petitioner was not\ndecided. Copy of the representations of the petitioner dated\n03.11.2007, 17.12.2009, 21.12.2009, 30.12.2009 & 22.11.2010 is\nannexed as Annexure P/10 (Colly). Again on 22.11.2010, the\nprovisional gradation lists were issued showing the position as on\n01.04.2008 to 01.04.2010 and again the petitioner was placed at\nserial No.3 below the respondents No. 5 & 6. Petitioner made\nrepresentation/objection dated 02.12.2010 and reminder on\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n12.10.2012.\n\n5. The State Government vide its order dated 30.05.2013 (Annexure\nP/2), rejected the representation without considering the grounds\nagitated by the petitioner and while rejecting the representation it\nwas held that the provisions of General conditions of Service\nRules, 1961 would not be applicable, because the promotions\nwere made under the Promotion Rules of 2003. The petitioner\nagain requested the authorities to review the order dated\n30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2). The review application has been\nrejected on 04.03.2015 and final gradation list was issued on\n07.03.2015 (Annexure P/14) and again the petitioner has been\nplaced at serial No.3. The petitioner made a representation to the\ndepartment and thereafter filed a petition before this Court which\nwas registered as W.P.(S) No. 4075/2014 (Annexure P/15) and the\nsame was disposed of on 21.11.2014 with certain direction.\nDepartment is going to convey the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee for the post of Additional Director and with malafide\nintention after near about 7 years and the final gradation list has\nbeen published ignoring the rules of 2003 and the rules of 1961.\nHence, this petition has been filed by the petitioner- Prateek Khare\nfor the following reliefs:-\n\n1] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\nissue a writ/writs, order/orders, direction/directions\nquashing the impugned orders dated 04.03.2015\n(Annexure P/1) and 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) and the\nrespondents No. 1 & 2 may kindly be directed to place\nthe petitioner in the gradation list of Joint Directors, in\nthe same order of merit determined by the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee in its meeting held\non 21.11.2005.\n\n2] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\ngrant any other relief(s), which is deemed fit and proper\nand the respondents may kindly be directed to place\nthe petitioner at serial No.1 in the gradation list of Joint\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nDirectors Women & Child Welfare Department and only\nthereafter, initiated the proceedings for promotion of\nJoint Directors to the post of Additional Director.\n\n3] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\nissue awrit/writs, order/orders, direction/directions and\nthe respondent No. 1 & 2 may kindly be directed to\nissue the fresh gradation list of Joint Directors cadre.\n\n4] That, this Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to\nissue a direction to the Secretary, General\nAdministration Department to hold an enquiry in respect\nof above mentioned entire matter.\n\n6. In WPS No. 5603 of 2017- The instant petition is filed by the\npetitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey against the promotion\ngranted to respondent No.3 way back in the year 2006 on the post\nof Joint Director in Women & Child Development department.\n\n7. Brief facts of the case as mentioned in WPS No. 5603/2017 are\nthat the petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey was appointed on\nthe post of District Women & Child Development Officer on\n03.09.1995. Thereafter, he was promoted on the post of Deputy\nDirector on 25.04.1998. The State of Chhattisgarh in the year\n2005 considered the names of Deputy Directors for promotion to\nthe post of Joint Director in Women and Child Welfare department.\n\nAs per the gradation list issued on 01.04.2004 the petitioner was\nplaced at serial number 3 from the top of the seniority list of\nDistrict Programme Officer/Deputy Director. Smt. Archana Seth\nand Smt. C.S. Lal were over and above in the seniority list of the\npetitioner whereas Shri Prateek Khare was junior to the petitioner\nin the gradation list. The promotion was to be made under\nChhattisgarh Women and Child Welfare (Gazetted) Service\nRecruitment Rules, 1990 read with Chhattisgarh Civil Services\nPromotion Rules, 2003. In the year 2005, total 3 posts were\nvacant against which the names of the petitioner and other Deputy\nDirectors were to be considered. Out of 3 posts, 2 posts were\nmeant for unreserved category and one post was meant for\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nScheduled Tribes candidate. DPC was convened on 21.11.2005 in\nwhich the name of petitioner was under the zone of consideration\nas he cleared the minimum standard required for to be considered\non merits for the purposes of promotion. As per the annual\nconfidential reports of the petitioner, he was graded as very good\nand his junior namely Prateek Khare was graded as outstanding\nand, therefore he was considered as preferably more meritorious\nthan the candidature of the petitioner while granting promotion to\nthe post of Joint Director. Thus, respondent No.3 was promoted to\nthe post of Joint Director vide order dated 07.05.2006 (Annexure\nP/1) whereby the seniority of the petitioner was overlooked as Mr.\nPrateek Khare superseded the petitioner in the matter of granting\npromotion. The other seniors namely Smt. Archana Rana Seth\nand Smt. C.S. Lal sought information from the respondent\ndepartment as to how the seniority is granted to Prateek Khare\nover and above them. They sought information under\nRTI Act\nas\nwell as from other sources about the grading given to the private\nrespondent in his annual confidential reports. The petitioner and\nother employees were thus superseded in promotion as well as\nseniority. But for a fairly longer period no information about Shri\nKhare or about the minutes of the Departmental Promotion\ncommittee meeting was ever given to the information seekers.\nCopies of Communications are annexed as Annexure P/2 & Copy\nof Gradation list is annexed as Annexure P/3. In the month of\nSeptember 2017, the petitioner was given the copy of minutes of\nmeeting held on 21.11.2005 wherein his name was under\n\nconsideration for promotion to the post of Joint Director. Copy of\nminutes of meeting is annexed as Annexure P/4. It is clear from\nthe minutes of the meeting that for promotion on the post of Joint\nDirector, 3 posts were vacant and for which the names of 6 Deputy\ndirectors were under consideration. Out of 6, the names of Shri\nDildar Singh Maravi and Smt. Preeti Khokar was not considered.\nThe name of petitioner was under consideration and the average\nvaluation was mentioned as very good but the committee refused\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nto recommend the name of the petitioner because the requisite\nnumbers of officers were already available. I\n\n8. Shri Prateek Khare was given remark as outstanding and found\nsuitable for promotion. But in the bottom note it is mentioned that\nfor the year 2001 there are 2 different annual confidential reports\nfor a single year. For 7 and a half months, the grade of respondent\nNo. 3 was A+ and for next 4 and a half months, his grade was C. It\nis clear that the average of A+ and C will be B which is below the\nstandard benchmark required as per rule 7 (4) of Chhattisgarh\nCivil Services Promotion Rules, 2003 required for consideration of\npromotion on merit-cum-seniority basis. Therefore, Shri Prateek\nKhare is out of the consideration zone on the date of DPC yet the\nDPC recommended the name of respondent no.3 for promotion\nquoting his grading as outstanding and also placing him over and\nabove his seniors in the gradation list of Joint Director. Hence, this\npetition has been filed by the petitioner- Surendra Kumar Choubey\nfor the following reliefs:-\n\n10.1. That all the records pertaining to the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee meeting\nheld in year 2005 and the Annual Confidential\nReports with respect to Petitioner and\nRespondent no.3 for granting promotion to the\npost of Joint Director, Woman and Child Welfare\ndepartment may be requisitioned for kind per\nusual of this Hon'ble Court.\n\n10.2 That the promotion order dated 27.05.2006\ngranting promotion to respondent no.3 to the\npost of Joint Director, Woman and Child Welfare\nDepartment may be set aside/quashed and\nRespondent no.1 may be directed to conduct\nReview Departmental Promotion Committee\nmeeting and petitioner may be considered for\ngranting promotion with effect from 27.05.2006 to\nthe post of Joint Director Women and Child\nWelfare Department along with all consequential\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nbenefits.\n\n10.3. That respondent no.1 may be directed to\nconduct a full-fledged enquiry on the fraud\ncommitted by the then members of Departmental\nPromotion Committee and other responsible\npersons due to which errorneous and illegal\npromotion has been granted to respondent no.1.\n\n10.4. That any other relief, which this Hon'ble\nCourt may deem fit and proper together with the\ncost of the petition.\n\n9. In WPS No. 885/2015, learned counsel for the petitioner submits\nthat the impugned orders are illegal erroneous and contrary to law.\nWhile rejecting the objection of the petitioner, the Rules of 2003\nand the General Condition of Service Rules 1961 were taken into\nconsideration. The impugned orders have been passed without\napplication of mind and without considering the grounds raised in\nthe representations/objections. The authorities while rejecting the\nrepresentation have failed to appreciate Rules 7(9) & 7(12) of\npromotion Rules 2003 and Rules 12(1)(b) of General Conditions of\nService Rules 1961. The State Government grossly erred in\nplacing the petitioner at serial No.3 contrary to the order of merit\ndetermined by the Departmental Promotion Committee and the\npromotion order passed by the department. The respondent\nauthorities erred in rejecting the objection of the petitioner in\nholding that the general condition of service rules 1961 would not\nbe applicable and the promotion Rules of 2003 would be\napplicable, but even the rules of 2003 have not been considered.\nRules of 1961 are general service rules applicable undoubtedly as\nmentioned in the opinion sought by the department from the\nGeneral Administration Department. With malafide intention the\nrepresentation and review application have been rejected and final\ngradation list has been issued, so that the undue advantage can\nbe given to private respondents. The petitioner has been deprived\nfrom his seniority. The representation of the petitioner was rejected\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nwithout any speaking order, even the review has been rejected\nerroneously upholding the order dated 30.05.2013. Therefore, the\nimpugned orders are liable to be set aside.\n\n10. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1, 2 & 4 strongly opposes\nthe prayer of the petitioner and submits that the the petitioner has\nbeen appointed on the post of Assistant Director vide order dated\n18.05.1995 whereas respondents No. 5 and 6 have been\nappointed to the post of Assistant Director vide order dated\n29.06.1993. Thus, they are much seniors to the petitioner. The\nDPC held on 21.11.2005 has evaluated the overall performance of\nthe employees, who were within the zone of consideration and\naccordingly they have been awarded the grading. The petitioner\nwas found outstanding whereas the respondents No. 5 and 6 have\nbeen found very good and accordingly they have been promoted\nvide promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5). Grading of\nDPC and placing of employees in serial number in the promotion\norder cannot be made basis for seniority to the promoted post. In\nsuch a situation, the provisions contained in Rule 12(1)(c) of the\nRules, 1961 will come into place. It is well settled principles of\nservice law that where the promotions are made on the basis of\nmerit-cum-seniority, the seniority of persons considered fit for\npromotion at the same time, shall be the same as the relative\nseniority in the lower grade from which they are promoted. From a\nbare perusal of the proceeding of the DPC dated 21.11.2005\n(Annexure P/6), it would be evident that if the promotions were\nmade on the basis of the seniority subject to rejection of unfit and\nin such a case, in the relative seniority of Deputy Director, the\npetitioner was at serial No. 4 whereas respondents No. 5 and 6\nwere at serial no. 1 and 2 respectively and therefore, after\nissuance of promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/5),\nwhen the seniority list of Joint Director was published as on\n01.04.2007, the petitioner was placed at serial No. 3 whereas\nrespondents No. 5 and 6 have been placed at serial Nos. 1 and 2\nrespectively. The representation of the petitioner was duly\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nconsidered by the competent authority and as per promotion rules\nand service rules, representation was rejected by the competent\nauthority. Therefore, the the petition is liable to be dismissed.\n\n11.Learned counsel for respondents No. 5 & 6 opposes the prayer of\nthe petitioner and submits that the petition filed by the petitioner is\nnot maintainable, since none of the rights of the petitioner has\nbeen violated. The petitioner had filed the instant writ petition\nbeing aggrieved by the impugned order for the reason that\nbecause of the impugned orders the chances of promotion of the\npetitioner to the next higher post of Additional Director would be\nadversely affected. It is a settled principle of law that no employee\nhas a right of promotion, the only right which an employee has a\nright to be considered for promotion. The writ jurisdiction cannot\nbe invoked merely on the ground that the chances of promotion in\nfuture are likely to be affected. The grant of promotion to the\nrespondents or to the petitioner on the next higher post of\nAdditional Director is contingent of several factors and events. In\nthe instant case, the petitioner and other eligible employees are\nyet to be considered for promotion to the next higher post of\nAdditional Director at this stage none of the rights of the petitioner\nhas been violated. Hence, the instant petition is pre-mature and is\nliable to be dismissed in limine.\n\n12.In WPS No. 5603/2017, learned counsel for the petitioner submits\nthat the impugned promotion order dated 07.05.2006 passed by\nrespondent No.1 promoting respondent No.3 instead of petitioner\nis illegal, arbitrary and malafide. The respondent authorities were\nwell aware about the contradictory entries made by the\nDepartment Promotion Committee with respect to granting of\noutstanding remark for respondent No.3, yet concealed the same\nfor years together in order to deprive the other counterparts of\nrespondent No.3 to illegally granted the benefit of promotion and\nseniority. The act on the part of respondent authorities amounts to\nfraud and malice in law in order to inflict injury upon the other\nemployees and to favour respondent No.3. The petitioner was\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nentitled for promotion as he duly fulfilled the required criteria for\npromotion to the post of Joint Director on the unreserved post. But\nhis junior that is respondent No.3, was considered over and above\nthe petitioner by denoting his outstanding performance despite\ncontradictory entry in his ACR's. The promotion enjoyed by\nrespondent No.3 for all these years will not accrue any right in his\nfavour as the promotion itself was granted on basis of concealing\nactual entries and mistaken fact which has to be cured at some\npoint of time. As the promotion granted to respondent No.3, in\nplace of the petitioner is on misinterpretation of the entries made\nin his ACR's, which was concealed for years together from the\npublic at large therefore, the promotion has to be quashed from\nthe date it was granted. It is the prime duty of the state to review\nand apply it's mind upon the recommendation made by the Public\nService Commission in the matters of promotion. In the present\ncase the clearing illegality and contradiction in the DPC minutes is\nwrit large the state cannot shut it's eyes ratify as mute spectator\nonly because it is recommendation of PSC. State cannot without\napplying its mind accept the recommendation of the Public Service\nCommission howsoever erroneous it may be. Therefore,\nimpugned order dated 27.05.2006 granting promotion to\nrespondent No.3 is liable to be set aside.\n\n13. Learned counsel for respondents No. 1 & 2 strongly opposes the\nprayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner sought for\nquashment of promotion order dated 27.05.2006 (Annexure P/1)\nafter inordinate delay of 11 years, therefore, this petition is liable to\nbe dismissed on this ground alone. In DPC meeting dated\n21.11.2005, the committee considered all aspects of promotion\nand recommended the name of officers for promotion and the\nrespondents on the basis of recommendation, promoted the\nconcerned officers and, therefore, this petition being without any\nsubstance is liable to be dismissed.\n\n14.Learned counsel for respondent No.3- Prateek Khare vehemently\nopposes the prayer of the petitioner and submits that the petitioner\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\nhas filed the instant petition after near about 12 years, therefore,\nthe instant petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay\nand laches. No explanation has been offered by the petitioner in\nhis writ petition except that he was served with the copies of the\nDepartmental Promotion Committee of 2005 in the month of\nSeptember 2017. It is clear that the said application under the RTI\nitself was filed on 20.09.2017 i.e. after near about 11 years from\nthe date of the order of promotion.\n\n15. The punishment of censure was imposed upon the petitioner and\nsubsequently he made an appeal against the order of punishment\nand on 08.08.2005 (Annexure R.3/2), the said punishment was\nset-aside, thereafter the petitioner was granted the proforma\npromotion on the post of Deputy Director with effect from 1998\nsubject to condition that he would be entitled for higher pay-scale\nonly from the date of his joining on the post of Deputy Director. On\n06.07.2005 (Annexure R.3/3), the petitioner along with the other\nemployees made a representation to the department which itself\nshows that the petitioner was aware in respect of the ACRs as well\nas in respect of the promotion of the answering respondent. The\nidentical issue raised by the other employee namely Smt. Archana\nRana i.e. W.P.(S) No. 1988/2017 has already been dismissed and\nWrit Appeal No. 239/2017 is pending under consideration.\nAnnexure R.3/4 is the copy of the order dated 27.04.2017.\nSubsequently, the Departmental Promotion Committee held on\n21.11.2005 for consideration of the cases of Deputy Directors for\npromotion on the post of Joint Director. The petitioner along with\nthe private respondents and other eligible Deputy Directors were\nconsidered for promotion on the post of Joint Director.\n\n16. The Departmental Promotion Committee shall make relative/\ncomparative assessment of the merit of the public servants on the\nbasis of their service records and placed them in the categories as\noutstanding, very good, average and poor as the case may be.\nHowever, only those public servants who were graded as very\ngood and above, will be included in the select list by placing the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\npublic servants graded as outstanding on the top followed by\nthose graded as very good subject to availability of vacancies.\nRespondent No.3 was graded as outstanding, therefore, he was\nplaced on top and one Archana Rana who was graded as Very\nGood was placed at Serial No.2 and C.S. Lal who belonged to the\nScheduled Tribe was considered against the third reserve post of\nScheduled Tribe. The petitioner though was graded as Very Good\nbut since he was junior to Archana Rana therefore, he was placed\nat serial No. 3 in the category of unreserved. This fact is apparent\non the face of the minutes of meeting of the Departmental\nPromotion Committee held on 21.11.2005. Therefore, this petition\nis liable to be dismissed.\n\n17. Reliance has been placed on the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in the matter of\nUnion of India and another Vs. S.K. Goel\nand others\nreported in (\n2007) 14 SCC 641, Shiba Shankar\nMohapatra and others Vs. State of Orissa and others\nreported\nin (2010) 12 SCC 471 and P.S. Sadasiv Aswamy Vs. State of\nTamil Nadu reported in (1975) 1 SCC 152 & on the orders of\nHon'ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh in the matter of Santosh\nKumar Shrivastava Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, Through\nAdditional Chief Secretary Water Resources Department and\nothers in 2023 SCC OnLine MP 1614 & Rajendra Singh\nKachwaha and another Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh Through\nPrincipal Secretary, Department of School Education and\nothers in 2023 SCC OnLine MP 3642.\n\n18.Heard counsel for the parties and perused the material available\non record.\n\n19. As regards WPS No. 5603/2017 filed by the petitioner- Surendra\nKumar Choubey, it is clear that this petition is against promotion\norder dated 27.05.2006 and respondents No. 1, 2 and 3 strongly\nobjected that this petition has been filed after 12 years of the\nimpugned order. It is clear from WPS No. 1988/2017 that this writ\nwas filed by Smt. Archana Rana and Smt. C.S. Lal and in the said\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\npetition, this Court observed in paras 2, 3 & 5 as under:-\n\n\"2. Since the petitioners were also promoted by the same order,\nas such they are not aggrieved by the entire order, however,\naccording to the petitioners, respondent No.5 having been placed\nat serial No.1 in the order of promotion, he will have preference in\nconsideration for promotion to the next higher post of Additional\nDirector. It is put forth that at the time of consideration of the\npromotion in the year 2006, the ACRs of respondent No.5 were\nnot good or not of such grade which would place him as an\noutstanding officer for placement at serial No.1 in the promotion\norder, therefore, he should not have been promoted.\n\n3. In para 7 of the writ petition, the petitioners would submit that\nthere is no delay in filing the instant writ petition because they\nwere pursuing the cause bonafidely and diligently firstly by filing\napplication under RTI seeking copies of the DPC proceedings,\nwhich was declined up to the State Information Commission.\nAfter supply of the copy, the petitioners have been continuously\npursuing their cause by filing repeated representations. The\ndepartment has drawn proceedings after the GAD and PSC have\nissued directions to the department, but nothing has been\ncommunicated apart from the assurance.\n\n5.\nIn the matter of\nK.R. Mudgal & Ors. Vs. R.P. Singh & Ors.\n1 and\n\nShiba Shankar Mohapatra & Ors. Vs. State of Orissa and Ors.\n2,\nthe Supreme Court has held that challenge to the seniority or\npromotion should be made within a reasonable time i.e. within a\nperiod of three to four years because after reasonable time the\nemployees get settled in their cadre and their rights are\ncrystallized.\"\n\n20. The writ appeal i.e. WA No. 239/2017 was dismissed as\nwithdrawn vide order dated 10.02.2021, therefore, it is clear that\ntwo officers who were promoted with respondent No.3- Prateek\nKhare, filed writ petition against the same order which was\ndismissed on the ground of delay. The petitioner has filed the\n(1986) 4 SCC 531\n(2010) 12 SCC 471\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\ninstant petition about 12 years of this order. Thus, in the light of\nprevious orders of this Court and principles of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in the matters of\nK.R. Mudgal and others vs. R.P. Singh and\nothers\nreported in (\n1986) 4 SCC 531 & Shiba Shankar Mohapatra\nand others Vs. State of Orissa and others\nreported in (2010) 12\nSCC 471, this writ petition No. 5603/2017 suffers from\nunexplained delay and laches and, therefore it deserves to be and\nis hereby dismissed on the ground of delay and laches.\n\n21. As regards WPS No. 885/2015, the petitioner has challenged the\norder dated 04.03.2015 (Annexure P/1) & 30.05.2013 (Annexure\nP/2) on the ground that DPC dated 21.11.2005, he was placed at\nserial No.1 in the seniority list at that time and now his seniority\nhas been disturbed.\n\n22. In this case, the petitioner relied on promotion rules, respondents\nalso quoted Rule 12 (1)(c) of the Rules, 1961 in their return.\nRespondents No. 5 & 6 also submits that the petitioner was junior\nto respondents No. 5 & 6. Respondents No. 5 & 6 made several\nrepresentations (Annexure R-5/6) to respondents with regard to\ntheir seniority and promotion. As the petitioner was junior to\nrespondents No. 5 & 6 therefore, he was rightly placed below the\nrespondents in the gradation list. The State Government before\npassing the order dated 30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2) had granted\nsufficient opportunity to the petitioner and after considering the\nentire records and representation of the petitioner, passed the\norder in accordance with law. The order dated 30.05.2013\n(Annexure P/2) was passed by the respondent authorities after\nhearing all the affected parties and considering the relevant\nstatutory provisions as well as the records of the case. The review\napplication filed by the petitioner did not disclose any new ground\nwhich warranted the State Government to review its order dated\n30.05.2013 (Annexure P/2).\n\n23. It is clear that the Rule 2003 specially deals with the promotion.\nAnnexure R-5/8 is the notification of Central Government dated\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n08.02.2002 which provides that order /list of promotion so issued\nmerely reflects the preference tendered in granting promotion to\nthe employees and it can never affect the gradation list of the\nemployees.\n\n24. Rule 12(1)(c) of the Rules, 1961 provides as under:-\n\n\"12. Seniority - XXX XXX XXX\n\n(1) (a) XXX XXX XXX\n\n(b) XXX XXX XXX\n\n(c) Where promotions are made on the basis of the seniority\nsubject to rejection of the unfit, the seniority of persons\nconsidered fit for promotion at the same time, shall be the same\nas the relative seniority in the lower grade from which they are\npromoted. Where, however, a person is considered as unfit for\npromotion and is superseded by a junior, such person shall not, if\nsubsequently found suitable and promoted, take seniority in the\nHigher grade over the junior persons who had superseded him.\"\n\n25. Thus, it is evident from the aforesaid Rule that where the\npromotion were made on the basis of the merit-cum-seniority, the\nseniority of person considered fit for promotion at the same time\nshall be the same as relative seniority in the lower grade from\nwhich they are promoted. Para 12 of the minutes of meeting of\nDPC dated 21.11.2005 (Annexure P/6) clearly shows the seniority\nof the petitioner and respondents No. 5 & 6 as on 01.01.2005 and\nthe same is reproduced as under:-\n\np;u lwfp;k¡ ¼o\"kZokj fjfDr;ksa ds vk/kkj ij½\n\no\"kZ vuqdzekad ofj\"Brk dzekad vf/kdkjh dk uke eqY;kadu\nLkekU;\n\n1-1-05 1 4 Jh izrhd [kjs mRd`\"V\n\n2 1 Jherh vpZuk cgqr vPNk\njk.kk lsB\nvuqlwfpr tkfr\n&\nvuqlwfpr\ntutkfr\n&\n3 2 Jherh\nfdzLVhuk ,l-yky cgqr vPNk\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:7146\n26. It is clear from representations of the petitioner and the orders of\nrespondents that the competent authority duly considered the\nrepresentation of the petitioner and passed impugned orders in\naccordance with rules and notifications of the State and Central\nGovernment. Therefore, this Court did not find any illegality or\nirregularity in the impugned orders passed by the respondent\nauthorities. Thus, the writ petition i.e WPS No. 885/2015 being\nwithout any substance is liable to be and is hereby dismissed.\n\n27. The aforesaid petitions are dismissed.\n\nSd/-\n\n(Rajani Dubey)\nJudge\nRuchi",
