[Main\nOpinion]\n Leave granted in Special Leave Petitions.\n\n1. These appeals/writ petitions raise an important but\ndifficult question concerning the nature of rule or\nreservation in promotions obtaining in the Railway service\nand the rule concerning the determination of seniority\nbetween general candidates and candidates belonging to\nreserved classes in the promoted category. The issue is best\nillustrated by taking the facts in the first of these\nmatters, viz., Union of India and Ors. v. Virpal Singh\nChauhan - civil appeal No.9272/95 arising from Special Leave\nPetition (C) No.6468 of 1987. The appeal is preferred\nagainst the judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal\n(Allahabad Bench) disposing of Original Application No.647\nof 1986 with certain directions. [It was originally filed as\na writ petition in the Allahabad High Court which, on the\nconstitution of the Central Administrative Tribunal\n(Allahabad Bench), was transferred to the Tribunal.] It was\nfiled by, what may be called for the sake of convenience,\nemployees not belonging to any of the reserved categories\n(hereinafter referred to as \"general candidates\" - which\nmeans open competition candidates). The railway\nAdministration as well as the employees belonging to\nreserved categories, i.e., Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes were impleaded as respondents. The writ\npetition/original application came to be filed in the\nfollowing circumstances:\n\n Among the category of Guards in the Railway service,\nthere are four categories, viz., Grade `C' Grade `B' Grade\n`A' and Grade `A'special. The initial recruitment is made to\nGrade `C' and they have to ascend rung after rung to go\nupwards. The promotion from one grade to another in this\ncategory is by seniority-cum-suitability. In other words,\nthey are \"non-selection posts\". The rule of reservation is\napplied not only at the initial stage of appointment to\nGrade `C' but at every stage of promotion. The percentage\nreserved for Scheduled Castes is fifteen percent and for\nScheduled Tribes 7.5%, a total of 22.5 percent. To give\neffect to the rule of reservation, a forty-point roster was\nprepared in which certain points were reserved for Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes respectively, commensurate with\nthe percentage of reservation in their favour. For Scheduled\nCastes candidates, the places reserved in the roster were:\n\n1, 8, 14, 22, 28 and 36 and in the case of Scheduled Tribes\ncandidates, they were: 4, 17 and 31. Subsequently, a\nhundred-point roster has been prepared, again reflecting the\naforesaid percentages.\n\n2. In the year 1986, the position was that both the\npetitioners in the original appalication (general\ncandidates) and the party-respondents in the said original\napplication (members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes) were in the grade of Guards Grade `A' in the\nNorthern Railway. On August 1, 1986, the Chief Controller,\nTundla passed orders promoting certain general candidates on\nad hoc basis to Grade `A' special. Within less than three\nmonths, however, they were sought to be reverted and in\ntheir place, members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes\nwere sought to be promoted. Compalining that such a course\nof action is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional, the\ngeneral candidates approached the High Court, which\npetition, as stated above, was transferred to the Tribunal.\nThe general candidates asked for three reliefs, viz., (a) to\nrestrain the Railway authorities from filling up the posts\nin the higher grades in the category of Guards by applying\nthe rule of reservation; (b) to restrain the Railway\nAdministration from acting upon the illegal seniority list\nprepared by them; and (c) to declare that the petitioners\n(general candidates) are entitled to be promoted and\nconfirmed in Guard Grade `A' special on the strength of\ntheir seniority earlier to the reserved category employees.\nTheir contention, in short, was (1) that once the quota\nprescribed for a reserved category is satisfied, the rule of\nreservation - or the forty-point roster prepared to give\neffect to the said rule - cannot be applied or followed any\nlonger and (2) that the forty-point roster is prepared only\nto give effect to the rule of reservation. It may provide\nfor accelerated promotion but it cannot give seniority also\nto a reserved category candidate in the promoted category.\nAccording to them, the seniority in Guard Grade `C' should\ngovern and should be reflected in all subsequent grades\nnotwithstanding the earlier promotion of the members of the\nreserved categories. Their case was that even if a reserved\ncategory member `X' is promoted from Grade `C' to Grade `B'\nearlier than his senior `Y' (general candidate), the\nposition should be that when the general candidate also gets\npromoted later to Grade `B' which means that in Grade `B',\n`Y' again becomes senior to `X'. They submitted that this\nshould be the rule to be followed to ensure that command of\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India prevails.\nThey relied upon two decisions of the Allahabad High Court\nand another decision of Madhya Pradesh in support of their\ncontention. They also relied upon certain circulars of the\nRailway Board in this behalf.\n\n3. The case of the Railway Administration (Respondent\nNos.1 to 4 in the original application) was that the\nAdministration is maintaining seperate seniority lists for\neach of the grades in the category of Guards according to\nthe policy in voque. The ad hoc promotions of general\ncandidates ordered on August 1, 1986 were irregular inasmuch\nas the seniors in the category of Grade `A' Guards were\nignored and juniors promoted by the Chief Controller,\nTundla. The Chief Controller, Tundla was not competent to\norder the said ad hoc promotions. The promotions ordered\nlater of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates is\nstrictly in accordance with the seniority position in Grade\n`A' and is unobjectionable. The Administration submsitted\nthat seniority is determined on the basis of the date of\npromotion and since promotion effected applying the forty-\npoint roster cannot be said to be an ad hoc promotion, a\nScheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate promoted earlier\nto a particular grade becomes senior to another candidate,\ngeneral or otherwise, who is promoted to that grade later.\nIn short, according to them, the date of promotion to a\nparticular grade determines the seniority in that grade.\n\n4. The reserved candidates (respondents in the original\napplication) supported the stand of the Administration. They\nsubmitted that the seniority list pertaining to Guards Grade\n`C' is not relevant and cannot be followed in the matter of\npromotion to Grade `A' special from Grade `A'. For the\npurpose of promotion to Grade-a special, the seniority list\npertaining to Grade `A' should be followed and since in that\ngrade, the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates were\nseniors, they were entitled to be promoted to Grade `A'\nSpecial earlier than their juniors in that seniority list.\nThey submitted that the seniority in a grade should be\ndetermined according to the date of promotion/appointment to\nthat grade and not in any other manner. They submitted that\ninasmuch as in the higher grades, the representation of\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes members was quite\ninadequate, the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates\nobtained rapid promotions from one grade to another but it\nis neither contrary to the rules nor is it inconsistent with\n\nArticles 16\n and \n14.\n In fact, the very rule of reservation in\npromotions is meant to increase the representation of\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates in the higher\nechelons of services quickly. No exception can be taken to\nthe said rule, they submitted.\n\n5. Since the Tribunal has strongly relied upon two\ndecisions of the Allahabad High Court and a decision of the\nMadhya Pradesh High COurt, it would be appropriate to refer\nto their ratio briefly.\n\n6. In Civil Writ Petition No.1809 of 1972, J.C. Mallik v.\nUnion of India, the allahabad High Court held that the rule\nof reservation or the forty-point roster, as the case may\nbe, cannot be followed and applied once the representation\nof Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in a particular grade,\ncadre or service, reaches the prescribed level of\npercentage. In other words, once the quota of 22 1/2% in\nfavour of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes is satisfied,\nthe rule of reservation/forty-point roster can no longer be\nfollowed and applied. \nIt may be mentioned that this decision\nhas since been referred with approval in the Constitution\nBench decision in \nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n (1995\n(2) S.C.C.745).\n\n7. The other decision of the Allahabad High Court is in\nSecond Appeal No.2745 of 1983 arising from Suit No.308 of\n1981, M.P. Dwivedi v. Union of India & Ors. The learned\nDistrict Judge, whose decision was under appeal in the said\nsecond appeal, had decreed the suit filed by the general\ncandidates in the following words: \"The defendants-\nappellants, their agents and servnts are restrained by means\nof permanent injunction from filling up the posts of higher\ngrade in the category of Guards by way of reservation in\nfavour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes candidates\nin excess of fixed by Railway Board. Their claim for\ndeclaration to the effect that they are entitled to be\npromoted to the higher grades in the category of Guards on\nthe strength of their seniority list prepared by the\ndefendant for Guards Grade-C on their initial grades is also\ndecreed\". When the matter came to the High Court, the\nlearned Single Judge, who disposed of the second appeal,\nheld:\n\n \"(A)fter having considered the entire\n position I am of the opinion that in the\n present case promotion from grade `A' to\n `A' Special cannot be made on the basis\n of reservation so long as Guards\n belonging to Scheduled Castes or\n Scheduled Tribes class in grade 1A'\n Special are in excess of the percentage\n reserved for them. The position,\n however, will always remain fluctuating\n and will have to be reviewed by the\n authorities from time to time. But the\n right of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n Tribes candidates to promotion merely on\n the basis or their seniority-cum-\n\n suitability without any reference to\n reservation will not be barred. As and\n when percentage of Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes guards in grade\n Scpecial goes down below the requisite\n percentage their right to promotion on\n the basis of reservation will revive.\n\n Subject to this modification the decree\n for injunction passed by the Court below\n is confirmed and the appeals are\n dismissed.\"\n\n8. The judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court is in\nG.C. Jain v. Divisional Rail Manager, Central Railway\n(reported in 1986 (1) S.L.R.588). The passage relied upon by\nthe Tribunal reads thus:\n\n \"Those SC & ST candidates who have come\n or been promoted due to reservation\n quota, having already jumped the queue,\n cannot be permitted to compete with\n general candidates for further\n promotion. They are a special class by\n themselves and they have only to go to\n the reserve quota for further promotion.\n If the reserve quota is already full in\n the next grade, the SC & ST candidates\n just below that grade in the reserve\n quota will have to wait till vacancy\n occurs in the higher grade in the\n reserve quota. However, we want to make\n it clear that this will not apply to\n such SC & ST candidates who on their own\n in competition with the general\n candidates have atained their present\n position and not due to reservation,\n they are entitled to compete further\n with the general candidates and they\n will not be affected for promotion in\n the general quota even if the reserved\n quota is full in the next higher grade\".\n\n9. On the basis of the aforesaid decisions and certain\ncirculars of the Railway Board, which will be referred at a\nlater stage, the Tribunal laid down the following principles\nin Para-26 of its judgment. (We have split up the paragraph\ninto several sub-paras to bring out the several principles\ndistinctly):\n\n \"26. To clarify the position further we\n will enunciate the principles of\n determining seniority in situations as\n are under dispute here.\n\n The basic seniority in grade `C'\n will be the quiding seniority list for\n the cadre of quards.\n\n Reservations in promotions would be\n made against posts in the grades and not\n against vacancies.\n\n Persons who are promoted by virtue\n of the application of roster would be\n given accelerated promotion but not the\n seniority.\n\n The seniority in a particular grde\n amongst the incumbents available for\n promotion to the next grade will be\n recast each time new incumbents enter\n from the lower grade on the basis of the\n initial grade `C' Guard who gets\n promoted to grade `B' or from grade `B'\n to grade `A' and so on will find his\n position amongst the incumbents of that\n grade on the basis of the original grade\n `C' seniority.\n\n Such persons as are superseded for\n any reasons other than on account of\n reservation will be excluded. A person\n superseded on account of a punishment or\n unfitness will count his seniority on\n the revised basis and not on original\n grade `C' seniority.\n\n The reserved community candidates\n who are senior not by virtue of\n reservations but by the position in\n grade `C' selections which the grade `C'\n seniority list will automatically take\n care of, will not wait for reservation\n percentage to be satisfied for their\n promotion. They will get promoted in\n their normal turn irrespective of the\n percentage of reserved community\n candidates in the higher grade. Others\n who get promoted as a result of\n reservation by jumping the queue will\n wait for their turn.\n\n Reservation will again have to be\n applied on depletion of the reservation\n quota in the higher grade to make good\n the shortfalls.\"\n\n10. The Tribunal directed that a fresh seniority list be\ndrawn in the light of the principles enunciated by it in\nPara-26 and promotions made on that basis. The Tribunal\nrejected the contention of the general candidates that \"no\npromotions at all be made for reserved community candidates\nbecause quota is full\". Similarly, it rejected the\ncontention of the general candidates (petitioners in the\noriginal applaication) that all promotions in the higher\ngrades shall be made on the basis of the seniority list\npertaining to Grade `C' alone. It held that the seniority\nlist will be separately prepared for each grade in\naccordance with the principles enunciated by it and that the\nlist must be updated every time there is promotion to that\ncategory. It clarified that a reserved community candidate\nwho gets promotion on his own merit and not on the basis of\nrule of reservation-cum-forty-point roster will be entitled\nto be promoted irrespective of the quota position. But those\nreserved community candidates who obtained promotion by\njumping the queue on the basis of rule of reservation will\nget the promotion on the basis of the revised seniority list\nto be prepared in accordance with the directions contained\nin Para-26.\n\n11. The Indian Railway Establishment Manual, Volume-I,\ncontains instructions regulating inter alia seniority of\nnon-gazetted Railway servants. They are contained in\nChapter-III. Para 306 says, \"candidates selected for\nappointment at an earlier selection shall be senior to those\nselected later irrespective of the dates of posting except\nin the case covered by paragraph 305 above\". Para 309 reads:\n\n\"SENIORITY ON PROMOTION.-- Paragraph 306 above applies\nequally to seniority in promotion vacancies in one and the\nsame category due allowance being made for delay, if any, in\njoining the new posts in the exigencies of service.\" Para\n314 says that subject to Paragraphs 302 to 306, \"when the\ndates of appointment to the grade are the same, the date of\nentry into the grade next below it shall determine\nseniority\". Para 319 deals with seniority on promotion to\nnon-selection posts. This paragraph states that \"promotion\nto non-selection posts shall be on the basis of seniority-\ncum-suitability, suitability being judged by the authority\ncompetent to fill the post, by oral and/or written test or a\ndepartmental examination or a trade test or by scrutiny of\nrecord of service as considered necessary.\" It further says\nthat \"a railway servant, once promoted in his turn after\nbeing found suitable against a vacancy, which is non-\nfortuitous, should be considered as senior in that grade to\nall others who are subsequently promoted after being found\nsuitable\".\n\n12. So far as the rule of reservation is considered, it has\nbeen made applicable to Railway service by orders issued by\nthe Railway Board from time to time pursuant to and in\nobedience to the policy decisions of the Ministry of Home\nAffairs. The decision of this Court in \nAkhil Bhartiya Soshit\nKaramchari Sangh v. Union of India\n (1981 (1) S.C.C.264)\nrefers to the several orders issued from time to time in\nthis behalf. They are also found at Pages 4 to 6 (Chapter-I)\nand Pages 59 to 89 (Chapter-III) of the Brochure on\nReservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in\nRailway Services (Third Edition-1985). We do not think it\nnecessary to refer to them in this judgment since we are\nconcerned herein not with the validity of the rule of\nreservation but with its nature and its effect upon the\nquestion of seniority. We shall, therefore, refer to the\nRailway Board's circulars alone relevant on this aspect.\nHere too, we will refer first to orders applicable to non-\nselection posts. Railway Board's letter dated 13th August,\n1959 is of a general nature. It says that \"as a general rule\nthe seniormost candidate should be promoted to a higher non-\nselection post, susbject to his suitability. Once promoted\nagainst a vacancy which is non-fortuitous, he should be\nconsidered as senior in the grade to all others who are\nsubsequently promoted\". [Printed at Page 507 in Chapter-XII\nof the Brochure aforesaid]*. The Railway Board's letter\ndated August 31, 1982 (at Page 512 - Chapter XII of the\nBrochure) deals with the subject \"Reservation for Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in promotion in Group `D' and\n`C' (Class IV and III) on the basis of seniority-cum-\nsuitability\". Para-4 of the letter reads:\n\n \"Against the above background, the\n matter has been reviewed by the Board.\n\n It has been decided that posting of\n Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe\n candidates on promotions in non-\n\n selection posts should also be done as\n per the reserved points on the roster\n susbject, however, to the condition that\n seniority of the Scheduled\n Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates in\n comparison to other candidates will\n continue to be governed by the panel\n position in the case of categories where\n training is not provided and in\n accordance with the merit position in\n the examination where training is\n provided.\"\n\n (Emphasis added)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* The several circulars and orders issued by the Railway\nBoard from time to time are arranged chapter-wise in the\nsaid Brochure. Chapter-V deals with Rosters, Chapter-IX with\npromotion to non-selection posts and Chapter-XII with\nconfirmation and seniority. The Brochure is published by the\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Railways (Railway Board),\nNew Delhi.\n\n13. It is evident that this letter is speaking of the\nseniority position in the initial entry category/grade. It\nsays that while posting shall be done as per roster points,\nseniority shall continue to be governed by the ranking given\nin the selection list/panel. This clearly brings out the\ndeparture being made from the normal principle that the date\nof entry in a category/grade determines the seniority.\n\n14. Indeed, the Railway Board's letter dated January 19,\n1972 (Pages 194-195 - Chapter-VIII dealing with promotion to\nselection posts - of the Brochure) shows that even in the\ncase of promotions made on the basis of merit, the same\nprinciple applies.\n\n15. The Railway Board's letter dated October 20, 1960\nreferred to in the judgment of Madhya Pradesh High Court in\nG.C. Jain says, \"seniority of SC/ST employees will be\ndetermined under the normal rules. The reservation roster is\nconsidered only a machinery to ensure the prescribed\npercentage of reservation for SC/ST employees and should not\nbe related to the question of seniority and confirmation. If\nany of the SC/ST employee is confirmed in the post by virtue\nof roster, such confirmation will not give them any benefit\nin respect of seniority\". Again, the very same idea stated\nclearly.\n\n16. At Page 503 of the Brochure, in Chapter-XXII dealing\nwith confirmation and seniority, Railway Board's letter\ndated February 11, 1972 is extracted, the relevant portion\nwhereof reads:\n\n \"Sub: Reservation for Scheduled Castes\n and Scheduled Tribes-- Application of\n roster both at the time of initial\n recruitment and confirmation.\n\n Reference Board's letter No.E(SCT)\n 62CM15/7 dated 20th April 1963 which\n provides that the reservation roster is\n to be applied only at the time of\n initial recruitment and that\n confirmation should be made in the order\n of seniority which in the case of non-\n trained categories is determined on the\n basis of the position in the panel\n supplied by the Railway Service\n Commission and in the case of trainee\n categories on the basis of the merit\n position in the examination.\n\n 2. The Board after careful\n consideration have decided that in the\n posts filled by direct recruitment on or\n after the date of issue of this letter,\n reservation may be made for Scheduled\n Castes and Scheduled Tribes both at the\n time of initial appointment on temporary\n basis as well as at the time of\n confirmation. In posts filled by\n promotion, however, no reservation is\n admissible at the stage of confirmation\n of promotees and the existing procedure\n of confirming employees in order of\n their panel position may continue.\"\n\n (Emphasis added)\n\n17. Again at Page 508, extracts of Railway Board's letter\ndated January 19, 1972 are set out, which read:\n\n \"3. The seniority of candidates\n belonging to Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes vis-a-vis others will\n continue to be determined as at present,\n i.e., according to the panel position in\n the case of categories where training is\n not provided and in accordance with the\n merit position in the examination where\n training is provided.\"\n\n And finally at Page 512, the circular/letter of the\nRailway Board dated August 31, 1982 is set out, which has\nalready been extracted hereinbefore.\n\n18. Pausing here for a moment, we must explain what does\npanel mean and signify in the case of promotions. Though we\nenquired repeatedly, this aspect could not be clarified by\nthe learned Additional Solicitor General. In particular, we\nwanted to know whether a panel is prepared only in the case\nof selection posts or is it also prepared in the case of\nnon-selection posts. The several instructions in Indian\nRailway Establishment Manual are also not helpful on this\naspect. We are, therefore, left to interpret the expression\nourselves. Having regard to the fact that in all the above\ncirculars/letters, the expression \"panel\" has been used to\ndenote a merit list or select list, as it may be called, we\nthink it reasonable to understand as a panel which is\nprepared in the case of selection posts only. In the case of\nnon-selection posts, there is no question of such a panel.\nIn their case, the senior is promoted automatically unless\nhe is found to be unsuitable to hold the promotion post. No\npanel, i.e., merit list or select list is called for in the\ncase of non-selection posts. May be, ultimately, a list of\npersons to be promoted is prepared but that is neither a\nmerit list, nor a select list.\n\n19. Sri Altaf Ahmed, learned Additional Solicitor General\nquestioned the correctness and validity of the principles\nenunciated by the Tribunal in Para-26 of its judgment. He\nsubmitted that according to the Indian Railway Establishment\nManual, seniority is determined by the date of\npromotion/appointment to the concerned grade and that the\nsaid principle cannot be altered or departed from in the\nname of ensuring equality. Once the rule of reservation is\nremembered that in the higher echelons of administration,\nrepresentation of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes has been\ninadequate all these years, there is nothing surprising if\nthe members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes get\npromotions sooner and earlier than the general candidates.\nThis is the natural consequence of applying the rule of\nreservation in promotions - and not an unintended one. The\nsaid consequence cannot, therefore, be a basis for evolving\na rule which partially off-sets the very purpose and meaning\nof the rule of reservation. Sri Altaf Ahmed further\nsubmitted that effecting promotions in accordance with the\nroster vacancies are not and cannot be called \"fortuitous\npromotions\". They are regular vacancies and promotion to\nthem is a regular promotion. He relied upon the decision of\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal in Durga Charan Haldar\nv. Union of India (Original Application No.854 of 1990)\nwherein it has been held that the date of promotion,\neffected following the forty-point roster/hundred-point\nroster, is determinative of seniority. He submitted that the\ndecision of the Central Administrative Tribunal (Patna\nBench) to the contrary is the subject matter of appeal in\nthis batch. The Patna Tribunal has followed the decision of\nthe Allahabad Tribunal in Virpal Singh Chauhan.\n\n20. Sri Rajeev Dhawan, learned counel appearing for the\nrespondents-general candidates, put forward the following\nsubmissions while opposing the contentions of the learned\nAdditional Solicitor General:\n\n(i) \nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution enables the State to\ndefine the extent and nature of the benefits to be extended\nto the backward classes. It is not as if there is only one\nparticular method of providing reservations under the said\nclause.\n\n(ii) The purpose behind \nArticle 16(4)\n is to ensure adequate\nrepresentation to backward classes in the administrative\napparatus of the State. The purpose of \nArticle 16(4)\n is only\nto ensure aequate representation and not to confer\nadditional benefits - other than those which logically flow\nfrom the rule of reservation. As soon as adequate\nrepresentation is achieved, the rule of reservation must be\nkept in abeyance and if there is a roster the application of\nthe roster must be stopped.\n\n(iii) A harmonious construction of clauses (4) and (1)\nof \nArticle 16 -\n both of which are indeed facets of the very\nsame principle of equality - implies that while the members\nof reserved categories will be entitled to equal treatment\nin all matters relating to service conditions, they cannot\nclaim accelerated seniority in addition to accelerated\npromotion. If this principle is not recognised, it would\nresult in the reserved category members stealing an\nadditional march over the general candidates which defeats\nthe quarantee of equality extended by \nArticle 16(1)\n to\ngeneral candidates. In other words, giving accelerated\nseniority in addition to accelerated promotion amounts to\nconferring double benefit upon the members of reserved\ncategory and is violative of rule of equality in \nArticle\n16(1).\n\n(iv) The command of \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution shall\nalso have to be kept in mind in this behalf. Accelerated\npromotion-cum-accelerated seniority is destructive of the\nefficiency of administration inasmuch as by this means the\nhigher echelons of administration come to be occupied almost\nentirely by members of reserved categories - at any rate,\nfar beyond the percentrage of reservation prescribed for\nthem.\n\n(v) The decisions of this Court clearly establish the\ndistinction between promotion and seniority. It would be too\nsimplistic to say that seniority automatically follows the\npromotion.\n\n(vi) A candidate belonging to reserved category\nappointed/promoted on the basis of rule of reservation\nshould not be held entitled to compete for a general vacancy\nin the roster. They should be confined to reserved vacancies\nalone. Non-observance of this rule has resulted in a\nsituation where in the higher grades of Railway Guards the\nrepresentation of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes has\nrisen upto seventy percent (in the case of Guard Super\nGrade) and forty percent (in the case of Guard Grade `A'\nSpecial) instead of 22.5 percent. This anomaly cannot be\nallowed to occur.\n\n21. Sri K.B. Rohtagi, learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondents in Civil Appeal No.2261 of 1987 (for Guards\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes categories)\nsupported the contentions of the learned Additional\nSolicitor General.\n\n ------- ------X------------X------------\n\n22. Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n of the Constitution enables\nthe State to make \"any provision for the reservation of\nappointments or posts in favour of any backward class of\ncitizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not\nadequately represented in the services under the State.\" \nIn\n\nIndra Sawhney v. Union of India\n (1992 Suppl.(III)\nS.C.C.217), it has been held by the majority (in the opinion\ndelivered by one of us, B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J.):\n\n \"The question then arises whether clause\n (4) of \nArticle 16\n is exhaustive of the\n topic of reservations in favour of\n backward classes. Before we answer this\n question it is well to examine the\n meaning and content of the expression\n `reservation'. Its meaning has to be\n ascertained having regard to the context\n in which it occurs. The relevant words\n are any provision for the reservation of\n appointments or posts'. The question is\n whether the said words contemplate only\n one form of provision namely reservation\n simpliciter, or do they take in other\n forms of special provisions like\n preferences, concessions and exemptions.\n\n In our opinion, reservation is the\n highest form of special provision, while\n preference, concession and exemption are\n lesser forms. The constitutional\n schemeand context of \nArticle 16(4)\n\n induces us to take the view that larger\n concept of reservations takes within its\n sweep all supplemental and ancillary\n provisions as also lesser types of\n special provisions like exemptions,\n concessions and relaxations, consistent\n no doubt with the requirement of\n maintenance of efficiency of\n administration - the admonition of\n \nArticle 335.\n The several concessions,\n exemptions and other measures issued by\n the Railway administration and noticed\n in Karamchari Sangh (1981 (1) S.C.C.246)\n are instances of supplementary,\n incidental and ancillary provisions made\n with a view to make the main provision\n of reservation effective i.e., to ensure\n that the members of the reserved class\n fully avail of the provision for\n reservation in their favour. The other\n type of measure is the one in Thomas\n (1976 (2) S.C.C.310). There was no\n provision for reservation in favour of\n Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the\n matter of promotion to the category of\n Upper Division Clerks. Certain tests\n were required to be passed before a\n Lower Division Clerk could be promoted\n as Upper Division Clerk. A large number\n of Lower Division clerks belonging to\n SC/ST were not able to pass those tests,\n with the result they were stagnating in\n the category of LDCs. Rule 13-AA was\n accordingly made empowering the\n Government to grant exemption to members\n SC/ST from passing those tests and the\n government did exempt them, not\n absolutely, but only for a limited\n period. This provision for exemption was\n a lesser form of special treatment than\n reservation. There is no reason why such\n a special provision should not be held\n to be included within the larger concept\n of reservation.\"\n\n23. This statement of law makes it clear that there is no\nuniform or prescribed method of providing reservation. The\nextent and nature of reservation is a matter for the State\nto decide having regard to the facts and requirements of\neach case. Such a situation was indeed dealt with in\n\nNational Federation of State Bank of India v. Union of India\n& Ors.\n (1995 (3) S.C.C. 432) [rendered by one of us, B.P.\nJeevan Reddy, J. on behalf of the Bench which included R.M.\nSahai and S.C. Sen, JJ.]. In the case of service under\nPublic Sector Banking Institutions, while reservation in\npromotions was provided in the case of promotion from Class-\nIV to Class-III, Class-III to Class-II and from Class-II to\nClass-I, no such reservation was provided so far as\npromotions within Class-I were concerned. Only a concession\n(set out in the judgment) was provided in favour of\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates with a view to\nenable them to obtain promotions within Clas-I which they\nmay not have obtained otherwise. It was held by this Court\nthat such a concession can also be provided under \nArticle\n16(4).\n In short, it is open to the State, if it is so\nadvised, to say that while the rule of reservation shall be\napplied and the roster followed in the matter of promotions\nto or within a particular service, class or category, the\ncandidate promoted earlier by virtue of rule of\nreservation/roster shall not be entitled to seniority over\nhis senior in the feeder category and that as and when a\ngeneral candidate who was senior to him in the feeder\ncategory is promoted, such general candidate will regain his\nseniority over the reserved candidate notwithstanding that\nhe is promoted subsequent to the reserved candidate. There\nis no unconstitutionality involved in this. It is\npermissible for the State to so provide. The only question\nis whether it is so provided in the instant case?\n\n24. It is the common case of the parties before us that the\nrule of reservation in the Railway services - to be more\nprecise to the category of Railway Guards, whether in the\nmatter of initial appointment or in the matter of promotion,\nfrom one grade to another, is provided by the\ncirculars/letters of the Railway Board. These\ncirculars/letters have been issued by the Railway Board in\nexercise of the power conferred upon it by Rule 123 of the\nStatutory Rules framed by the President of India. We have\nreferred to the circulars/letters of the Railway Board\nhereinbefore. In the circular/letter dated August 31, 1982\nwhich deals with the subject of \"Reservation for Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in promotion in Group `D' and\n`C' (Class IV and III) on the basis of seniority-cum-\nsuitability\" it is specifically ordered that while \"posting\nof Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates on promotions\nin non-selection posts should also be done as per the\nreserved points on the roster\", such promotion shall be\n\"subject to the condition that seniority of the Scheduled\nCaste/Scheduled Tribe candidates in comparison to other\ncandidates will continue to be governed by the panel\nposition in the case of categories where training is not\nprovided and in accordance with the merit position in the\nexamination where training is provided\". So far as the\nseveral grades among Railway Guards are concerned, the\nrelevant service conditions do not provide for any training\nfollowed by examination on promotion from one grade to\nanother. Hence, the seniority between the reserved category\ncandidates and general candidates in the promoted category\nshall continue to be governed by their panel position. We\nhave discussed hereinbefore the meaning of the expression\n\"panel\" and held that in case of non-selection posts, no\n\"panel\" is prepared or is necessary to be prepared. If so,\nthe question arises, what did the circular/letter dated\nAugust 31, 1982 mean when it spoke on seniority being\ngoverned by the panel position? In our opinion, it should\nmean the panel prepared by the selecting authority at the\ntime of selection for Grade `C'. It is the seniority in this\npanel which must be reflected in each of the higher grade.\nThis means that while the rule of reservation gives\naccelerated promotion, it does not give the accelerated - or\nwhat may be called, the consequential - seniority. There is,\nhowever, one situation where this rule may not have any\npractical relevance. In a given case, it may happen that by\nthe time the senior general candidate gets promoted to the\nhigher grade, the junior reserved category candidate (who\nwas promoted to the said higher grade earlier) may got\npromoted to yet higher grade. In other words, by the time\nthe senior general category candidate enterss, say, Grade\n`B', his junior Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate is\npromoted to Grade `A'. It is obvious that in such a case,\nthe rule evolved in the aforesaid circulars does not avail\nthe senior general candidate for there can be no question of\nany seniority as between, say, a person in `B' grade and a\nperson in `A' grade.\n\n25. Now let us see how does the above principle operate in\npractice. Selection is made for direct recruitment to Grade\n`C' Guards. A panel is prepared by the selecting authority\non the basis of and in the order of merit. Appointments have\nto be made from out of this list/panel. But appointment\norders will not be issued in the order in which the\ncandidates are arranged in this select list/panel; they will\nbe issued following the roster. Suppose the forty-point\nroster is being operated afresh, then the first vacancy\ninthe roster would go to a Scheduled Caste candidate though\nhe may be down below in the select list/panel. The candidate\nat Sl. No.1 in the said select list - a general candidate -\nwill be appointed in the second vacancy. But once appointed,\nthe general candidate (at Sl. No.1 in the select list) will\nrank senior to the Scheduled Caste candidate though he\n(general candidate) is appointed subsequent to the Scheduled\nCaste candidate. Now take the case of promotions (based on\nseniority-cum-suitability, i.e., non-selection posts) to\nGrade `B'. Roster applies even to promotions to Grade B'.\nAgain assume that the forty-point roster is opening now in\nGrade `B'. The first vacancy has again got to go to a\nScheduled Caste candidate though he may not be the senior-\nmost in Grade `C'. The senior-most candidate in Grade `C'\n(the general candidate, who was at Sl. No.1 in the select\nlist/panel and who regained his seniority on appointment to\nGrade `C' as aforestated) will be promoted in the next\nvacancy. But once promoted, the general candidate again\nbecomes senior to the Scheduled Caste candidate though\npromoted subsequent to the Scheduled Caste candidate. And so\non and so forth. It is in this manner that the rule of\nreservation (and the roster) merely enables a reserved\ncategory candidate to obtain an appointment or promotion, as\nthe case may be - which he may not have obtained otherwise\nor would not have obtained at the time he is now getting -\nbut it does not give him the seniority. In this sense, the\nrule confers a limited benefit - a qualified benefit. We\nhave already stated that such a rule of reservation does not\nfall foul of \nArticle 16(4).\n\n26. We are of the opinion that the aforesaid\ncirculars/letters providing for reservation in favour of\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates, rosters and\ntheir operation and on the subject of seniority as between\ngeneral candidates and reserved category candidates, being\nin the nature of special rules prevail over the general\ninstructions contained in Volume-I of the Indian Railway\nEstablishment Manual including those contained in Paras 306,\n309 and 319 et al. Accordingly, we agree with the conclusion\nof the Tribunal in the order under appeal (Virpal Singh\nChauhan) though we may not agree with all the reasons given\nby the Tribunal. In other words, we may not agree with the\nview expressed by the Tribunal that a harmonious reading of\nClauses (1) and (4) of \nArticle 16\n should mean that a\nreserved category candidate promoted earlier than his\nsenior-general category candidate in the feeder category\nshall necessarily be junior in the promoted category to such\ngeneral category candidate. No such principle may be said to\nbe implicit in the said clauses. But inasmuch the Railway\nBoard's ciruclars concerned herein do provide specifically\nfor such a situation and since they cannot be said to be\nviolative of the constitutional provisions, they must\nprevail and have to be given effect to. It is not brought to\nour notice that the said instructions are inconsistent in\nany manner with any of the statutory provisions or statutory\nrules relevant in this behalf.\n\n27. So far as the other question considered by the Tribunal\n(viz., that once the representation of the reserved\ncategories in a given unit of appointment reaches the\nprescribed percentage, the rule of reservation or the roster\nbased on it cannot be given effect to), the Constitution\nBench decision of this Court in \nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of\nPunjab\n settles the issue. In this decision, it has been held\nthat where the total number of posts in a cadre reserved for\nreserved candidates are filled by operation of a roster, the\nobject of rule of reservation must be deemed to have been\nachieved and that thereafter there would be no justification\nto operate the roster. Para-5 of \nthe said judgment\n brings\nout the reasons for the said rule and the rule itself:\n\n \"We see considerable force in the second\n contention raised by the learned counsel\n for the petitioners. The reservations\n provided under the impugned Government\n instructions are to be operated in\n accordance with the roster to be\n maintained in each Department. The\n roster is implemented in the form of\n running account from year to year. The\n purpose of `running account' is to make\n sure that the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\n Tribes and and Backward Classes get\n their percentage of reserved posts. The\n concept of `running account' in the\n impugned instructions has to be so\n interpreted that it does not result in\n excessive reservation. `16% of the\n posts...' are reserved for members of\n the Scheduled Castes and Backward\n Classes. In a lot of 100 posts those\n falling at Serial Numbers 1, 7, 15, 22,\n 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65, 72, 80, 87 and\n 91 have been reserved and earmarked in\n the roster for the Scheduled Castes.\n Roster points 26 and 76 are reserved for\n the members of Backward Classes. It is\n thus obvious that when recruitment to a\n cadre starts then 14 posts earmarked in\n the roster are to be filled from amongst\n the members of the Scheduled Castes. To\n illustrate, first post in a cadre must\n go to the Scheduled Castes and\n thereafter the said class is entitled to\n 7th, 15th, 22nd and onwards upto 91st\n post. When the total number of posts in\n a cadre are filled by the operation of\n the roster then the result envisaged by\n the impugned instructions is achieved.\n\n In other words, in a cadre of 100 posts\n when the posts earmarked in the roster\n for the Scheduled Castes and the\n Backward Classes are filled the\n percentage of reservation provided for\n the reserved categories is achieved. We\n see no justification to operate the is\n to operate only till the quota provided\n under the impugned instructions is\n reached and not thereafter. Once the\n prescribed percentage of posts is filled\n the numerical test of adequacy is\n satisfied and thereafter the roster does\n not survive. THe percentage of\n reservation is the desired repesentation\n of the Backward Classes in the State\n Services and is consistent with the\n demographic estimate based on the\n proportion worked out in relation to\n their population. The numerical quota of\n posts is not a shifting boundary but\n represents a figure with due application\n of mind. Therefore, the only way to\n assure equality of opportunity to the\n Backward Classes and the general\n category is to permit the roster to\n operate till the time the respective\n appointees/promotees occupy the posts\n meant for them in the roster. The\n operation of the roster and the `running\n account' must come to an end thereafter.\n The vacancies arising in the cadre,\n after the initial posts are filled, will\n pose no difficulty. As and when there is\n a vacancy whether permanent or temporary\n in a particular post the same has to be\n filled from amongst the category to\n which the post belonged in the roster.\n For example, the Scheduled Caste persons\n holding the posts at roster points 1, 7,\n 15, retire then roese slots are to be\n filled from amongst the persons\n belonging to the Scheduled Castes.\n Similarly, if the persons holding the\n post at points 8 to 14 or 23 to 29\n retire then these slots are to be filled\n from among the general category. By\n following this procedure there shall\n neither be shortfall nor excess in the\n percentage of reservation.\"\n\n28. The Constitution Bench has, however, made it clear that\nthe rule enunciated by them shall operate only prospectively\n[vide Para 11]. It has further been held in \nthe said\ndecision\n that the \"percentage of reservation has to be\nworked out in relation to the number of posts which form the\ncadre-strength (and that) the concept of `vacancy' has no\nrelevance in operating the percentage of reservation\". (As a\nmatter of fact, it is stated that this batch of cases were\nalso posted for hearing before the Constitution Bench along\nwith R.L. Sabharwal batch of cases but these cases were de-\nlinked on the ground that they raise certain other issues\nwhich did not arise in R.K. Sabharwal.) Be that as it may,\nas a result of the decision in R.K. Sabharwal and the\nviews/findings recorded by us hereinabove, the following\nposition emerges:\n\n(i) Once the number of posts reserved for being filled by\nreserved category candidates in a cadre, category or grade\n(unit for application of rule of reservation) are filled by\nthe operation of roster, the object of rule of reservation\nshould be deemed to have been achieved and thereafter the\nroster cannot be followed except to the extent indicated in\nPara-5 of R.K. Sabharwal. While determining the said number,\nthe candidates belonging to the reserved category but\nselected/promoted on their own merit (and not by virtue of\nrule of reservation) shall not be counted as reserved\ncategory candidates.\n\n(ii) The percentage of reservation has to be worked out in\nrelation to number of posts in a particular cadre, class,\ncategory or grade (unit for the purpose of applying the rule\nof reservation) and not with respect to vacancies.\n\n(iii) So far as Railway Guards in Railway service are\nconcerned - that is the only category we are concerned\nherewith - the seniority position in the promoted category\nas between reserved candidates and general candidates shall\nbe the same as their inter se seniority position in Grade\n`C' at any given point of time provided that at that given\npoint of time, both the general candidate and the reserved\ncategory candidates are in the same grade. This rule\noperates whether the general candidate is included in the\nsame batch of promotees or in a subsequent batch. (This is\nfor the reason that the circulars/letters aforesaid do not\nmake or recognise any such distinction.) In other words,\neven if a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate is\npromoted earlier by virtue of rule of reservation/roster\nthan his senior general candidate and the senior general\ncandidate is promoted later to the said higher grade, the\ngeneral candidate regains his seniority over such earlier\npromoted Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate. The\nearlier promotion of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe\ncandidate in such a situation does not confer upon him\nseniority over the general candidate even though the general\ncandidate is promoted later to that category.\n\n29. If the above three rules are observed and followed,\nthere may not remain much room for grievance on the part of\nthe general candidates. While in the very scheme of things,\nit is not possible to give retrospective effect to these\nrules -a fact recognised in R.K. Sabharwal - the above\nrules, operated conjointly, should go a long way in\nmaintaining a balance between the demands of merit and\nsocial justice.\n\n30. Sri Rajeev Dhawan, learned counsel for the general\ncandidates, pointed out, what according to him, are the\ninequitable and anamolous situations which would follow, if\nthe candidate appointed/promoted on the basis of rule of\nreservation is not confined to reserved posts alone and is\nallowed to compete for general posts as well. In such a\nsituation, he submits, the reserved candidate will enjoy yet\nanother - third - advantage. Whenever, it is convenient to\nhim, he will claim to be considered for a reserved post and\nwhere it is more convenient to him, he will claim to be\nconsidered for a general post, whereas a general candidate\nis restricted to general posts alone. In our opinion,\nhowever, the plea of the learned counsel cannot simply be\naccepted; his submission flies in the face of the\nestablished law on the subject.\n\n31. Sri Dhawan then pointed out that Rule 3 stated above is\nnot sufficient to do justice to the general candidates and\nthat in practice, it has resulted in denial of just rights\nto general candidates. He elaborates his submission thus; a\nreserved category candidate may get promoted from Grade `C'\nto Grade `B' earlier than his senior general category\ncandidate (senior with reference to the select list/panel\nprepared at the time of selection to Grade `C' by operation\nof rule of reservation/roster. The general candidate who is\nsenior to him in the said select list/panel may get promoted\nto Grade `B' later but what may happen, meanwhile, is that\nthe reserved category candidate is no longer there in Grade\n`B' - he has ascended to Grade `A'. In such a situation,\nthere will be no occasion for applying the aforesaid Rule 3\nas between these two candidates. Sri Dhawan submits that\nthis is precisely what has happened in the case of Railway\nGuards. Even the Railway Administration has admitted this\nsituation in their counter, he says, though they have\nascribed it to inadequate representation of the reserved\ncategories in the higher grades. Sri Dhawan says that, in\npractice, the candidates belonging to reserved categories\ngot rapid promotions, leaving their erstwhile senior general\ncandidates in the category in which they were originally\nappointed. \nMay be that Sri Dhawan's complaint is true - we\nhave already dealt with the possibility and consequence of\nsuch a situation - but his grievance, in effect, is not\nagainst Rule 3 aforestated but against the very rule of\nreservation being applied in promotions. It may be recalled\nthat in Indra Sawhney, eight of the nine learned Judges\nconstituting the Bench opined that \nArticle 16(4)\n does not\npermit or warrant reservation in the matter of promotions.\nThis was precsely for the reason that such a rule results in\nseveral untoward and inequitous results. The Bench, however,\npermitted the existing rules in that behalf to operate for a\nperiod of five years from the date of judgment based as\nthose rules were on an earlier Constitution Bench decision\nin \nGeneral Manager, Southern Railway & Anr. v. Rangachari\n\n(1962 (2) S.C.R.687). It is another matter that since then a\nconstitutional amendment has been brought in permitting\nreservation in promotions to the extent of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes only, we need express no opinion on the\nsaid amendment.\n\n32. Sri Dhawan points out yet another anamoly. Where a\ncandidate belonging to Scheduled Caste gets selected on his\nown merit, i.e., in the general category, he will be treated\nas a general candidate and on that account he suffers\nprejudice vis-a-vis another reserved category candidate who\ncould not be selected on his own merit (i.e., in the general\ncategory) and was selected only because of and under the\nrule of reservation. For illustrating his submission,\nlearned counsel says, take an instance where out of forty\ncandidates selected, a Scheduled Caste candidate selected on\nmerit stands at S. No.18 in the select list, whereas another\nScheduled Caste candidate selected under and only because of\nthe reserved quota stands at S. No.33. But when the occasion\nfor appointment arises, the Scheduled Caste candidate at Sl.\nNo.33 will be be appointed against the first roster-point,\nwhereas the Scheduled Caste candidate at S. No.18, being a\ngeneral candidate has to wait for his turn. This, the\nlearned counsel says, amounts, in effect, to punishing the\nScheduled Caste candidate at S. No.18 for his merit. Because\nhe ws meritorious, he was selected in general gcategory and\nis treated as a general candidate. He suffers all the\ndisadvantages any other general candidate suffers while\nanother Scheduled Caste candidate, far less meritorieous\nthan him and who was selected only by virtue of rule of\nreservation, steals a march over him in the matter of\ninitial appointment and in promotion after promotion\nthereafter. This is undoubtedly a piquant situation and may\nhave to be appropriately rectified as and when the occasion\narises. It is not pointed out that any such situation has\narisen in the appeals before us. It is probable that many\nsuch situations may arise which cannot be foretold now.\nAccording to the general category candidates concerned\nherein, of course, the rule of reservation/roster has\nalready given rise to many distortions. According to them,\nthe representation of the reserved categories in Guard Grade\n`A' Special has reached forty percent as against the\nprescribed 22.5 percent. It is not possible for us to say,\non the material before us, how and why the said situation\nhas come about. It may be partly because the rule now\nenunciated in R.K. Sabharwal was not there and was not being\nfollowed. It may also be that such a result has been brought\nabout by a combined operation of the factors mentioned in\n\n(i) and (ii) above. The fact remains that the situation -\nassuming that it is what is described by the general\ncandidates - cannot be rectified with retrospective effect\nnow. The Constitution Bench in R.K. Sabharwal too has\ndirected that the rule enunciated therein shall have only\nprospective operation. So far as the present appeals are\nconcerned, it is sufficient to direct that the Railway\nauthorities shall hereinafter follows Rules (i), (ii) and\n\n(iii) [stated in Para No.28] with effect from the date of\njudgment in R.K. Sabharwal, i.e., February 10, 1995.\n\n33. Learned counsel have sought to bring to our notice\nindividual facts of some of the appeals before us but we do\nnot propose to enter into those facts or make any\npronouncement thereon. The proper couse, in our considered\nopinion, is to send all these matters back to the Tribunal\nto work out the rights of individuals concerned applying the\nthree principles aforesaid. These appeals are accordingly\ndisposed of in the above terms and matters remanded to the\nrespective Tribunals. Write petitions are dismissed. No\ncosts.\n\n SELECTION POSTS\n CIVIL APPEAL NO.9276 OF 1995\n ARISING OUT OF S.L.P. (C) NO.18370 OF 1993:\n\n34. Delay condoned. Leave granted.\n\n35. This appeal arises from the judgment of Central\nAdministrative Tribunal (Madras Bench) allowing Original\nApplication No.869 of 1991 filed by the respondent, Sri D.\nWilliams. The relevant facts, drawn from the counter filed\non behalf of the Railway Board and its officials before the\nTribunal, are the following:\n\n36. The cadre of Station Masters is divided into five\ngrades. The grades and inter se percentage is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSl. Category & Grade Whether selection Percentage\nNo. or non-selection distribution\n of post in\n each grade\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Asst. Station Master Recruitment/ 10%\n Rs.1200-2040 Selection\n\n2. Station Master Non-Selection 70%\n Rs.1400-2300\n\n3. Station Master/T.I Non-Selection/ 10%\n Rs.1600-2600 Recruitment\n\n4. Dy. Station Supdt/T.I.Selection 10%\n Rs.2000-3200\n\n5. Station Supdt./T.I Selection 10% of posts\n Rs.2375-3500 in Rs.2000-3200\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37. The posts of Assistant Station Masters in the scale of\nRs.1200-2040/- are filled by direct recruitment through\nRailway Recruitment Boards to the extent of fifty percent.\nThe balance fifty percent is filled by promotion of\ndepartmental employees. The higher grades in the said cadre\nare filled by promotion from the immediately lower grde.\nTwenty five percent of the posts in the scale of Rs.1600-\n2600/- are, however, filled by direct recruitment of Traffic\nApprentices.\n\n38. The first respondent, Sri Williams (petitioner in the\noriginal application before the Tribunal) was promoted to\nthe post of Deputy Station Superintendent/Traffic Inspector\nin the scale of Rs.2000-3200/- on December 30, 1989.\nActually, he was initially appointed as a Signaller in the\nscale of Rs.60-150/-. Over the years, he earned promotions\none after the other. In the scale of Rs.130-240/-, he was\nsenior to Respondent Nos.4 to 10 in the original application\n(they are not impleaded as respondents in this appeal), all\nof whom belong to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. Because\nof rule of reservation and the manner in which it was\nimplemented, the said Scheduled Castes/Schedule Tribes\ncandidates were promoted to the higher categories soosner.\nThey came to be promoted to the post of Deputy Station\nSuperintendent/Traffic Inspector in the scale of Rs.2000-\n3200/- far earlier to Sri Williams, i.e., on January 1, 1984\nor earlier. On that basis, the said Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates were being treated as\nseniors to Sri Williams who is, of course, a general\ncandidate.\n\n39. The posts of Station Superintendent/Traffic Inspector\nin the scale of Rs.2375-3500/- are controlled by and dealt\nwith at Head Quarter's level. They are filled on \"All\nRailway\" basis by a process of selection (which comprises of\nviva-voce only) from among the Deputy Station\nSuperintendents/Traffic Inspectors in the scale of Rs.2000-\n3200/-.\n\n40. Eleven vacancies arose in the scale of Rs.2375-3500/-.\nAccording to rules, three candidates have to be considered\nfor every vacancy. Accordingly, a list of thirty three\nsenior-most candidates in the sacle of Rs.2000-3200/- was\nprepared on the basis of their respective dates of entry in\nthe said grade. They were `alerted' to be ready to appear\nfor the interview by a letter dated July 12, 1991. All the\nthirty three senior-most employees so alerted belong to\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. Sri Williams was not\namong the thery three. It is then that Sri Williams\napproached the Tribunal praying for setting aside the alert\nnotice dated July 12, 1991, to revise the seniority list of\nall the grades in the Station Masters' category protecting\nthe seniority of general candidates and for a further\ndeclaration that rule of reservation cannot be applied\nagainst vacancies. He sought a further declaration that the\nsaid rule of reservation is confined to recruitment to the\nscale of Rs.1200-2040/- alone - i.e., to the lowest grade in\nthe cadre - and not to higher grades.\n\n41. The Tribunal allowed the original application filed by\nSri Williams following its earlier decision in Original\nApplication No.85 of 1989. The Tribunal declared that for\nthe purpose of promotion under the general quota, seniority\nof the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates should\nnot be determined on the basis of the date of their actual\npromotion but on the basis of the date on which they would\nhave been promoted in due course if the rule of reservation\nwere not applied. The Tribunal, however, declared that the\nseniority in the grade of Rs.1600-2600/- shall not be\ndisturbed because the applicant had not approached the\nTribunal in time to challenge the seniority in that scale.\nThe relief granted by the Tribunal is in the following\nterms:\n\n \"In the result, we allow the application\n and pass the following orders:-\n\n We direct the respondents to revise the\n seniority of the applicants and\n respondents in the scale of Rs.2000-3200\n taking into account for the applicant\n his date of actual promotion and for the\n respondents 4 to 10 the date on which\n they would have been granted promotion\n in that grade but for the preferential\n treatment based on reservation.\n Promotion shall be made according to a\n selection based on the revised list.\"\n\n42. The learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for\nthe appellants (Union of India and the Railways) challenged\nthe correctness of the decision of that Tribunal on the\nground that it has evolved a principle of seniority not\nrecognised by any rule or circular orders of the Railway\nBoard and is unsustainable in any event. He submitted,\nrelying upon the decision in \nKaram Chand v. Haryana State\nElectricity Board\n (1989 Suppl.(1) S.C.C.342) that the date\nof promotion to a particular grade or category determines\nthe seniority in that grade or category. Inasmuch as the\nsaid thirty three candidates were alerted (Called for) on\nthe basis of their seniority for interview (for selection to\neleven posts in the grade of Rs.2375-3500/-) no valid\ngrievance can be made by any one to such a course.\n\n43. Sri S. Murlidhar, learned counsel for Sri D. Williams\nsubmits that this is a demonstrable case of injustice being\ndone to general candidates by applying not only the rule of\nreservation at every stage of promotion but also because the\nrule of seniority enunciated by the Railway Board in its\nseveral circulars was not being followed by the concerned\nauthorities. He submits that it is for the Railways to\nexplain how the situation has come about where all the\nthirty three candidates being considered for eleven\nvacancies happen to belong exclusively to Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes categories. He subsmits that Sri\nWilliams ws admittedly a senior to Respondent Nos.4 to 10\n(in the original application, i.e., Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates) in the grade of Rs.130-\n240/- but then the said Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes\ncandidates obtained rapid and preferential promotions to\nnext higher grades, viz., Rs.330-560/-, Rs.425-640/-,\nRs.455-700/-, Rs.1600-2600/- and then to the grade of\nRs.2000-3200/-. They reached the grade of Rs.2000-3200/-\nmore than five years earlier to Sri Williams who was their\nsenior in the lower category of Rs.130-240/- The result of\nfaulty implementation of rule of reservation and rule of\nseniority is that all the top grades have come to be\noccupied exclusively by the reserved category members, a\nsituation, which he characterises as a total negation of the\nRule of Equality underlying \nArticles 16(1)\n, 16(4)\n and \n14.\n He\nemphasises the fact that the Railways have not explained in\ntheir counter as to how the above situation has come about\nexcept stating baldly that since the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates were seniors to Sri\nWilliams in the grade of Rs.2000-3200/-, they were rightly\nalerted for interview.\n\n44. It is true that this case presents a rather poiiignant\nturn of events. Of the thirty three candidates being\nconsidered for eleven vacancies, all are Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates. Not a single candidate\namong them belongs to general category. The learned counsel\nfor the respondent is justified in complaining that\nappellants have failed to explain how such a situation has\ncome about. Not only the juniors are stealing a march over\ntheir seniors but the march is so rapid that not only\nerstwhile compatriots are left far behind but even the\npersons who were in the higher categories at the time of\nentry of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates in the\nservice have also been left behind. Such a configuration\ncould not certainly have been intended by the framers of the\nConstitution or the framers of the rules of reservation. In\nthe absence of any explanation from the authorities, the\nbest we can do is to ascribe it as faulty implementation of\nthe rule of reservation. In other words, not only have the\nRailways not observed the principle that the reservation\nmust be vis-a-vis posts and not vis-a-vis vacancies but they\nhad also not kept in mind the rule of seniority in the\npromotion posts enunciated in the Railway Board's circulars\nreferred to supra. Yet another principle which the\nauthorities appeared to have not observed in practice is\nthat once the percentage reserved for a particular reserved\ncategory is satisfied in that service category or grade\n(unit of appointment) the rule of reservation and the roster\nshould no longer be followed. Because of the breach of these\nthree rules, it appears, the unusual situation complained of\nby the general candidates has come to pass. The learned\ncounsel for general candidates is right that such a\nsituation is bound to lead to acute heart-burning among the\ngeneral candidates which is not conducive to the efficiency\nof administration. Be that as it may, the question is can\nthe said situation be rectified. Probably not, until we\ndirect all the promotions to be reviewed and re-done. This\nmay not be advisable at this distance of time. The enormity\nof the exercise should deter any one from launching upon\nsuch a course. It is evidently for this reason that the\nConstitution Bench has directed in R.K. Sabharwal that the\nrule affirmed by them should be applied only prospectively.\nThere is yet another circumstance: the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates cannot be barred from\ncompeting for general posts. We are constrained to remark\nthat it is the application of rule of reservation in the\nmatter of promotions -which entitles a reserved category\ncandidate to avail of the benefit of reservation any number\nof times which is mainly responsible for such a situation.\n\n45. While referring to the Railway Board's\ncirculars/letters in civil appeals No.9272/95 (arising from\nS.L.P.(C) No.6468 of 1987 and batch), we had referred to the\nRailway Boards circular/letter dated January 19, 1972\ndealing with promotion to selection posts. (Para-3 of the\nsaid letter is in the same terms as Para-4 of the Railway\nBoard's circular/letter dated August 31, 1982 referred to\nsupra.) The said Para-3 reads: \"(3) The seniority of\ncandidates belonging to Scheduled Cates and Scheduled Tribes\nvis-a-vis others will continue to be determined as at\npresent, i.e., according to the panel position in the case\nof categories where training is not provided and in\naccordance with the merit position in the examination where\ntraining is provided.\" But inasmuch as the post of Station\nSuperintendent/T.I. in the scale of Rs.2375-3500/- is a\nselection post, the panel referred to in the said\ncirculars/letters would mean the panel prepared at the time\nof making selections for promotion to the said post\n(Rs.2375-3500/-) - and not the panel/select list prepared at\nthe time of entry into the initial grade, viz., Assistant\nStation Master (Rs.1200-2-40/-). It also means that members\nin one panel take precedence over the members in the next\npanel. The application of the rule of seniority referred to\nin the said circular/letter - and other circulars/letters\nreferred to supra most of which do not make any distinction\nbetween selection and non-selection posts - has to be\nsubject to the said limitation.\n\n46. It may be noticed that of the five grades in the\nStation Masters' category, two are non-selection posts while\nthe remaining three are selection posts. While in the case\nof non-selection posts the rule enunciated in the main\nopinion (Virpal Singh Chauhan) would be applicable, in the\ncase of selection posts, the rule explained herein has to be\nfollowed. We may clarify that Rules (i) and (ii) in Para 28\nof Virpal Singh Chauhan apply to both selection and non-\nselection posts. Rule (iii) also applies to both but subject\nto the above rider. As explained in the main opinion, while\nthere is no question of a \"panel\" being prepared at the time\nof promotion to non-selection posts, a panel has to be\nprepared for promotion to selection posts.\n\n47. This appeal is accordingly allowed and the matter\nremanded to the Tribunal with a direction to dispose of the\noriginal application afresh in the light of the principles\nenunciated herein. No costs.\n\n CIVIL APPEAL NO.9275 OF 1995\n\n ----------------------------\n\n ARISING OUT OF S.L.P.(C) NO.4102 OF 1994:\n\n -----------------------------------------\n\n48. Delay condoned. Leave granted.\n\n49. The respondent [petitioner before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal (Allahabad Bench), Sri Mohd. Sabir,\njoined the Railways as an Office Clerk on December 20, 1957.\nHe was promoted as Head Clerk and then as an Assistant\nSuperintendent. His promotion to the post of Assistant\nSuperintendent was on March 12, 1985. The next promotion is\nto the post of Superintendent. He approached the Tribunal\ncomplaining that when two vacancies arose in the category of\nSuperintendents, the Railway Authorities called certain\nScheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates for interview\nin preference to him though they are far juniors to him. He\ngave three instances, viz., (1) Sri A.P. Pramanik, who\njoined the service twenty years after him and who was\npromoted as Assistant Superintendent only on February 22,\n1988. (2) Sri Kamal Kishore, who was initially appointed as\nClass IV employee but who is being treated as senior to the\npetitioner and (3) Sri Amrendra Kumar Das, who was appointed\nas an Office Clerk twenty two years after his appointment\nand who came to be promoted as Assistant Superintendent on\nFebruary 25, 1986. The grievance of Sri Mohd. Sabir is this:\n\nthe total sanctioned strength of the category of\nSuperintendents (Grade Rs.2000-3200/- RPS) is thirteen.\nThere are three vacancies. Of the remaining ten, only two\nare general candidates and the remaining eight belong to\nScheduled Castes. Inspite of the same, the candidates now\nbeing considered for promotion are again Scheduled Castes\ncandidates which is likely to result in an almost total\nreservation in the said category in favour of the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates. The case of the\nappellants (respondents in the original application) is that\nthey are considering the senior most candidates for the\nvacancies arising in the category of Superintendents and,\ntherefore, no objection can be taken with the said course by\nany aone.\n\n50. The Tribunal has allowed the original application in\nthe following terms:\n\n \"It appears that some mathematical\n mistake occurred on the part of the\n department in making the promotion and\n deciding the seniority. According to\n learned counsel in view of Vir Pal Singh\n Chauhan's case these candidates are to\n be reverted. Whether they are to be\n reverted or not that is the matter for\n the respondents to decide all such\n observations which have been made in Vir\n Pal Singh's case, but the respondents\n are directed to promote the members of\n the general community to the extent they\n are entitled to by adhering to the\n seniority. Accordingly, since the matter\n is not decided finally by the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court, However those persons who\n have already been promoted, keep them\n for the post of Supdt. and will adjust\n the seniority list accordingly in\n accordance with Vir Pal Singh's case.\n Let all these be done within the period\n of 3 months from the date of\n communication of this order. No order as\n to the costs.\"\n\n51. This appeal is liable to be dismissed applying the\nprinciple enunciated in R.K. Sabharwal. It is evident that\nout of the cadre-strength of thirteen, there were three\nvacancies on the date of filing of the original application\nbefore the Tribunal and of the remaining ten posts, only two\nwere occupied by the general candidates and the remaining\neight were occupied by the members of Scheduled Castes.\nSince the representation of Scheduled Castes is already far\nbeyond their quota, no further Scheduled Castes candidates\ncould have been considered for the remaining three\nvacancies. This means that the Scheduled Castes candidates\ncan be considered only as and along with general candidates\nbut not as members belonging to a reserved category. The\nappeal is accordingly dismissed with the aforesaid\nclarification.\n\n CIVIL APPEAL NO.9274 OF 1995\n\n ----------------------------\n\n ARISING OUT OF S.L.P.(C) NO.6924 OF 1988:\n\n -----------------------------------------\n\n52. Delay condoned. Leave granted.\n\n53. This matter pertains to promotion to the posts of\nOffice Superintendents Grade-I, Office Superintendent Grade-\nII and Head Clerk. The original application was filed by\nthree candidates belonging to general category. Their\ngrievance was that the representation of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates has already exceeded the\npercentage reserved for them and inspite of that the\nScheduled Castes candidates are again being considered for\nthe vacancies arising in the said categories. By way of\nillustration, they pointed out, the sanctioned strength of\nthe category of Head Clerks is six. Four are filled up and\nthere are two vacancies. Out of the four posts already\nfilled up, two are held by general category candidates and\ntwo by the members of Scheduled Castes. The claim of the\noriginal petitioners (respondents in this appeal), which has\nbeen upheld by the Calcutta Tribunal, is that the remaining\ntwo vacancies should go only to general candidates. Similar\ndirection has been made with respect to other two categories\nas well. The Tribunal further directed that the rule of\nreservation must be applied with reference to posts and not\nwith reference to vacancies. The main contention of the\nUnion of India and the Railway Authorities in this appeal is\nthat the rule of reservation in favour of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes should be applied to vacancies and\nnot to total number of posts in the cadre. It is submitted\nthat the Tribunal was in error in holding that the rule of\nreservation should be so applied as to ensure that the posts\nheld by Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes do not exceed the\nprescribed percentage. It is submitted that this was never\nthe intention of the Constitution or the rule of\nreservation.\n\n54. The only contention urged by the appellants herein is\nconcluded against the appellants by the decision of this\nCourt in R.K. Sabharwal, referred to hereinbefore. Following\nthe said decision this appeal is dismissed with the\nclarification that the members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\nTribes can also compete as general candidates. The appellant\nshall follow and apply the said decision. No costs.\n\n ---------------X--------------------X--------------\n Before parting with these appeals, we feel obliged to\nreiterate the principle affirmed in Indra Sawhney that\nproviding reservation in promotion is not warranted by\n\nArticle 16(4).\n The facts of these cases illustrate and\ndemonstrate the correctness of the said holding. They also\nbring home the intractable problems that arise from such\nprovision - problems that defy solutions. No more need we\nsay on this aspect. The decision in Indra Sawhney speaks for\nitself.",

These appeals/writ petitions raise an important but\ndifficult question concerning the nature of rule or\nreservation in promotions obtaining in the Railway service\nand the rule concerning the determination of seniority\nbetween general candidates and candidates belonging to\nreserved classes in the promoted category.

On August 1, 1986, the Chief Controller,\nTundla passed orders promoting certain general candidates on\nad hoc basis to Grade `A' special. Within less than three\nmonths, however, they were sought to be reverted and in\ntheir place, members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes\nwere sought to be promoted. Compalining that such a course\nof action is illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional, the\ngeneral candidates approached the High Court, which\npetition, as stated above, was transferred to the Tribunal.\nThe general candidates asked for three reliefs, viz., (a) to\nrestrain the Railway authorities from filling up the posts\nin the higher grades in the category of Guards by applying\nthe rule of reservation; (b) to restrain the Railway\nAdministration from acting upon the illegal seniority list\nprepared by them; and (c) to declare that the petitioners\n(general candidates) are entitled to be promoted and\nconfirmed in Guard Grade `A' special on the strength of\ntheir seniority earlier to the reserved category employees.\nTheir contention, in short, was (1) that once the quota\nprescribed for a reserved category is satisfied, the rule of\nreservation - or the forty-point roster prepared to give\neffect to the said rule - cannot be applied or followed any\nlonger and (2) that the forty-point roster is prepared only\nto give effect to the rule of reservation.

The\nsaid consequence cannot, therefore, be a basis for evolving\na rule which partially off-sets the very purpose and meaning\nof the rule of reservation. Sri Altaf Ahmed further\nsubmitted that effecting promotions in accordance with the\nroster vacancies are not and cannot be called \"fortuitous\npromotions\". They are regular vacancies and promotion to\nthem is a regular promotion. He relied upon the decision of\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal in Durga Charan Haldar\nv.

In the circular/letter dated August 31, 1982\nwhich deals with the subject of \"Reservation for Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in promotion in Group `D' and\n`C' (Class IV and III) on the basis of seniority-cum-\nsuitability\" it is specifically ordered that while \"posting\nof Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidates on promotions\nin non-selection posts should also be done as per the\nreserved points on the roster\", such promotion shall be\n\"subject to the condition that seniority of the Scheduled\nCaste/Scheduled Tribe candidates in comparison to other\ncandidates will continue to be governed by the panel\nposition in the case of categories where training is not\nprovided and in accordance with the merit position in the\nexamination where training is provided\". So far as the\nseveral grades among Railway Guards are concerned, the\nrelevant service conditions do not provide for any training\nfollowed by examination on promotion from one grade to\nanother. Hence, the seniority between the reserved category\ncandidates and general candidates in the promoted category\nshall continue to be governed by their panel position. We\nhave discussed hereinbefore the meaning of the expression\n\"panel\" and held that in case of non-selection posts, no\n\"panel\" is prepared or is necessary to be prepared. If so,\nthe question arises, what did the circular/letter dated\nAugust 31, 1982 mean when it spoke on seniority being\ngoverned by the panel position? In our opinion, it should\nmean the panel prepared by the selecting authority at the\ntime of selection for Grade `C'. It is the seniority in this\npanel which must be reflected in each of the higher grade.\nThis means that while the rule of reservation gives\naccelerated promotion, it does not give the accelerated - or\nwhat may be called, the consequential - seniority. There is,\nhowever, one situation where this rule may not have any\npractical relevance. In a given case, it may happen that by\nthe time the senior general candidate gets promoted to the\nhigher grade, the junior reserved category candidate (who\nwas promoted to the said higher grade earlier) may got\npromoted to yet higher grade. In other words, by the time\nthe senior general category candidate enterss, say, Grade\n`B', his junior Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe candidate is\npromoted to Grade `A'. It is obvious that in such a case,\nthe rule evolved in the aforesaid circulars does not avail\nthe senior general candidate for there can be no question of\nany seniority as between, say, a person in `B' grade and a\nperson in `A' grade."

      "text": "25. Now let us see how does the above principle operate in\npractice. Selection is made for direct recruitment to Grade\n`C' Guards. A panel is prepared by the selecting authority\non the basis of and in the order of merit. Appointments have\nto be made from out of this list/panel. But appointment\norders will not be issued in the order in which the\ncandidates are arranged in this select list/panel; they will\nbe issued following the roster. Suppose the forty-point\nroster is being operated afresh, then the first vacancy\ninthe roster would go to a Scheduled Caste candidate though\nhe may be down below in the select list/panel. The candidate\nat Sl. No.1 in the said select list - a general candidate -\nwill be appointed in the second vacancy. But once appointed,\nthe general candidate (at Sl. No.1 in the select list) will\nrank senior to the Scheduled Caste candidate though he\n(general candidate) is appointed subsequent to the Scheduled\nCaste candidate. Now take the case of promotions (based on\nseniority-cum-suitability, i.e., non-selection posts) to\nGrade `B'. Roster applies even to promotions to Grade B'.\nAgain assume that the forty-point roster is opening now in\nGrade `B'. The first vacancy has again got to go to a\nScheduled Caste candidate though he may not be the senior-\nmost in Grade `C'. The senior-most candidate in Grade `C'\n(the general candidate, who was at Sl. No.1 in the select\nlist/panel and who regained his seniority on appointment to\nGrade `C' as aforestated) will be promoted in the next\nvacancy. But once promoted, the general candidate again\nbecomes senior to the Scheduled Caste candidate though\npromoted subsequent to the Scheduled Caste candidate. And so\non and so forth. It is in this manner that the rule of\nreservation (and the roster) merely enables a reserved\ncategory candidate to obtain an appointment or promotion, as\nthe case may be - which he may not have obtained otherwise\nor would not have obtained at the time he is now getting -\nbut it does not give him the seniority. In this sense, the\nrule confers a limited benefit - a qualified benefit. We\nhave already stated that such a rule of reservation does not\nfall foul of \nArticle 16(4)."

The\n purpose of `running account' is to make\n sure that the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\n Tribes and and Backward Classes get\n their percentage of reserved posts. The\n concept of `running account' in the\n impugned instructions has to be so\n interpreted that it does not result in\n excessive reservation. `16% of the\n posts...' are reserved for members of\n the Scheduled Castes and Backward\n Classes. In a lot of 100 posts those\n falling at Serial Numbers 1, 7, 15, 22,\n 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65, 72, 80, 87 and\n 91 have been reserved and earmarked in\n the roster for the Scheduled Castes.\n Roster points 26 and 76 are reserved for\n the members of Backward Classes. It is\n thus obvious that when recruitment to a\n cadre starts then 14 posts earmarked in\n the roster are to be filled from amongst\n the members of the Scheduled Castes. To\n illustrate, first post in a cadre must\n go to the Scheduled Castes and\n thereafter the said class is entitled to\n 7th, 15th, 22nd and onwards upto 91st\n post.

The general candidate who is\nsenior to him in the said select list/panel may get promoted\nto Grade `B' later but what may happen, meanwhile, is that\nthe reserved category candidate is no longer there in Grade\n`B' - he has ascended to Grade `A'. In such a situation,\nthere will be no occasion for applying the aforesaid Rule 3\nas between these two candidates.

Even the Railway Administration has admitted this\nsituation in their counter, he says, though they have\nascribed it to inadequate representation of the reserved\ncategories in the higher grades.

It may be recalled\nthat in Indra Sawhney, eight of the nine learned Judges\nconstituting the Bench opined that \nArticle 16(4)\n does not\npermit or warrant reservation in the matter of promotions.\nThis was precsely for the reason that such a rule results in\nseveral untoward and inequitous results.

Where a\ncandidate belonging to Scheduled Caste gets selected on his\nown merit, i.e., in the general category, he will be treated\nas a general candidate and on that account he suffers\nprejudice vis-a-vis another reserved category candidate who\ncould not be selected on his own merit (i.e., in the general\ncategory) and was selected only because of and under the\nrule of reservation. For illustrating his submission,\nlearned counsel says, take an instance where out of forty\ncandidates selected, a Scheduled Caste candidate selected on\nmerit stands at S. No.18 in the select list, whereas another\nScheduled Caste candidate selected under and only because of\nthe reserved quota stands at S. No.33. But when the occasion\nfor appointment arises, the Scheduled Caste candidate at Sl.\nNo.33 will be be appointed against the first roster-point,\nwhereas the Scheduled Caste candidate at S. No.18, being a\ngeneral candidate has to wait for his turn. This, the\nlearned counsel says, amounts, in effect, to punishing the\nScheduled Caste candidate at S. No.18 for his merit. Because\nhe ws meritorious, he was selected in general gcategory and\nis treated as a general candidate. He suffers all the\ndisadvantages any other general candidate suffers while\nanother Scheduled Caste candidate, far less meritorieous\nthan him and who was selected only by virtue of rule of\nreservation, steals a march over him in the matter of\ninitial appointment and in promotion after promotion\nthereafter.

He submitted,\nrelying upon the decision in \nKaram Chand v. Haryana State\nElectricity Board\n (1989 Suppl.(1) S.C.C.342) that the date\nof promotion to a particular grade or category determines\nthe seniority in that grade or category. Inasmuch as the\nsaid thirty three candidates were alerted (Called for) on\nthe basis of their seniority for interview (for selection to\neleven posts in the grade of Rs.2375-3500/-) no valid\ngrievance can be made by any one to such a course."

Williams\nsubmits that this is a demonstrable case of injustice being\ndone to general candidates by applying not only the rule of\nreservation at every stage of promotion but also because the\nrule of seniority enunciated by the Railway Board in its\nseveral circulars was not being followed by the concerned\nauthorities. He submits that it is for the Railways to\nexplain how the situation has come about where all the\nthirty three candidates being considered for eleven\nvacancies happen to belong exclusively to Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes categories. He subsmits that Sri\nWilliams ws admittedly a senior to Respondent Nos.4 to 10\n(in the original application, i.e., Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates) in the grade of Rs.130-\n240/- but then the said Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes\ncandidates obtained rapid and preferential promotions to\nnext higher grades, viz., Rs.330-560/-, Rs.425-640/-,\nRs.455-700/-, Rs.1600-2600/- and then to the grade of\nRs.2000-3200/-. They reached the grade of Rs.2000-3200/-\nmore than five years earlier to Sri Williams who was their\nsenior in the lower category of Rs.130-240/- The result of\nfaulty implementation of rule of reservation and rule of\nseniority is that all the top grades have come to be\noccupied exclusively by the reserved category members, a\nsituation, which he characterises as a total negation of the\nRule of Equality underlying \nArticles 16(1)\n, 16(4)\n and \n14.\n He\nemphasises the fact that the Railways have not explained in\ntheir counter as to how the above situation has come about\nexcept stating baldly that since the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates were seniors to Sri\nWilliams in the grade of Rs.2000-3200/-, they were rightly\nalerted for interview."

      "text": "44. It is true that this case presents a rather poiiignant\nturn of events. Of the thirty three candidates being\nconsidered for eleven vacancies, all are Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates. Not a single candidate\namong them belongs to general category. The learned counsel\nfor the respondent is justified in complaining that\nappellants have failed to explain how such a situation has\ncome about. Not only the juniors are stealing a march over\ntheir seniors but the march is so rapid that not only\nerstwhile compatriots are left far behind but even the\npersons who were in the higher categories at the time of\nentry of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes candidates in the\nservice have also been left behind. Such a configuration\ncould not certainly have been intended by the framers of the\nConstitution or the framers of the rules of reservation. In\nthe absence of any explanation from the authorities, the\nbest we can do is to ascribe it as faulty implementation of\nthe rule of reservation. In other words, not only have the\nRailways not observed the principle that the reservation\nmust be vis-a-vis posts and not vis-a-vis vacancies but they\nhad also not kept in mind the rule of seniority in the\npromotion posts enunciated in the Railway Board's circulars\nreferred to supra. Yet another principle which the\nauthorities appeared to have not observed in practice is\nthat once the percentage reserved for a particular reserved\ncategory is satisfied in that service category or grade\n(unit of appointment) the rule of reservation and the roster\nshould no longer be followed. Because of the breach of these\nthree rules, it appears, the unusual situation complained of\nby the general candidates has come to pass. The learned\ncounsel for general candidates is right that such a\nsituation is bound to lead to acute heart-burning among the\ngeneral candidates which is not conducive to the efficiency\nof administration. Be that as it may, the question is can\nthe said situation be rectified. Probably not, until we\ndirect all the promotions to be reviewed and re-done. This\nmay not be advisable at this distance of time. The enormity\nof the exercise should deter any one from launching upon\nsuch a course. It is evidently for this reason that the\nConstitution Bench has directed in R.K. Sabharwal that the\nrule affirmed by them should be applied only prospectively.\nThere is yet another circumstance: the Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates cannot be barred from\ncompeting for general posts. We are constrained to remark\nthat it is the application of rule of reservation in the\nmatter of promotions -which entitles a reserved category\ncandidate to avail of the benefit of reservation any number\nof times which is mainly responsible for such a situation."

While referring to the Railway Board's\ncirculars/letters in civil appeals No.9272/95 (arising from\nS.L.P.(C) No.6468 of 1987 and batch), we had referred to the\nRailway Boards circular/letter dated January 19, 1972\ndealing with promotion to selection posts. (Para-3 of the\nsaid letter is in the same terms as Para-4 of the Railway\nBoard's circular/letter dated August 31, 1982 referred to\nsupra.) The said Para-3 reads: \"(3) The seniority of\ncandidates belonging to Scheduled Cates and Scheduled Tribes\nvis-a-vis others will continue to be determined as at\npresent, i.e., according to the panel position in the case\nof categories where training is not provided and in\naccordance with the merit position in the examination where\ntraining is provided.\" But inasmuch as the post of Station\nSuperintendent/T.I. in the scale of Rs.2375-3500/- is a\nselection post, the panel referred to in the said\ncirculars/letters would mean the panel prepared at the time\nof making selections for promotion to the said post\n(Rs.2375-3500/-) - and not the panel/select list prepared at\nthe time of entry into the initial grade, viz., Assistant\nStation Master (Rs.1200-2-40/-). It also means that members\nin one panel take precedence over the members in the next\npanel. The application of the rule of seniority referred to\nin the said circular/letter - and other circulars/letters\nreferred to supra most of which do not make any distinction\nbetween selection and non-selection posts - has to be\nsubject to the said limitation."

The original application was filed by\nthree candidates belonging to general category. Their\ngrievance was that the representation of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes candidates has already exceeded the\npercentage reserved for them and inspite of that the\nScheduled Castes candidates are again being considered for\nthe vacancies arising in the said categories. By way of\nillustration, they pointed out, the sanctioned strength of\nthe category of Head Clerks is six. Four are filled up and\nthere are two vacancies. Out of the four posts already\nfilled up, two are held by general category candidates and\ntwo by the members of Scheduled Castes. The claim of the\noriginal petitioners (respondents in this appeal), which has\nbeen upheld by the Calcutta Tribunal, is that the remaining\ntwo vacancies should go only to general candidates. Similar\ndirection has been made with respect to other two categories\nas well. The Tribunal further directed that the rule of\nreservation must be applied with reference to posts and not\nwith reference to vacancies. The main contention of the\nUnion of India and the Railway Authorities in this appeal is\nthat the rule of reservation in favour of Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes should be applied to vacancies and\nnot to total number of posts in the cadre. It is submitted\nthat the Tribunal was in error in holding that the rule of\nreservation should be so applied as to ensure that the posts\nheld by Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes do not exceed the\nprescribed percentage.
