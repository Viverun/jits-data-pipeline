No. 20636 of 2021, listed at serial no. 1 (Shamima\n\n Khatoon vs. State of Bihar and others) as the lead case. For brevity\n\n sake, this Court is not taking note of the various memo numbers\n\n and dates in different writ applications at this stage, however, those\n\n will be referred to at appropriate stage. This Court would refer\n\n them as impugned office order(s).\n\n Case of the Petitioners-Category-I\n\n 6. It is the case of the petitioner(s) that they were\n\n appointed on the post of assistant teachers in different districts as\n\n back as in the year 1982. One Kaushal Kumar filed a Public\n\n Interest Litigation in this Court vide C.W.J.C. No.10002 of 2016,\n\n alleging that a large number of irregularities have taken place in\n\n the matter of appointment of Assistant Teachers in Lower\n\n Subordinate Education Service (in short 'LSS'). The Hon'ble\n\n Division Bench while hearing C.W.J.C. No.10002 of 2016, passed\n\n the order dated 19.06.2016 by which the authorities of the\n\n Department of Education, Government of Bihar including the\n\n Principal Secretary, Department of Education were called upon to\n\n appear in person with an explanation by way of affidavit as to why\n\n necessary action has not been taken by the State-respondents on\n\n the report of the C.B.I. and what action has been taken against\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n 22/87\n\n those persons who have made illegal appointments. The Hon'ble\n\n Division Bench, however, observed as follows:-\n\n \"We make it clear that no termination of service of\n teachers shall take place pursuant to the report of the\n C.B.I. without giving notice to the teachers concerned\n and without following the due process of law.\"\n 7. It is stated that in fact the matter relating to\n\n appointment of Assistant Teachers during the said period were\n\n subject matter of inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (in\n\n short 'C.B.I.' or 'CBI'). C.B.I. had submitted a report after\n\n examining the appointments of 'LSS' by different appointing\n\n authorities during the period 1980-1998. The report of the CBI\n\n indicated that large number of appointments were made without\n\n any advertisement of the post in any local newspaper, no roster\n\n clearance was obtained, reservation rules were not followed and\n\n there was no proceeding of any selection committee for selection\n\n of the candidates. Some of the appointments were made of the\n\n candidates who were over aged and appointing authorities were\n\n not even competent to make regular appointments.\n\n 8. The report submitted by the CBI revealed that in\n\n certain cases, the applicants who did not posses the required\n\n qualification of Matric Trained Teachers, were appointed in lower\n\n scale of Matric Untrained Teachers and subsequently, upon\n\n acquiring the Matric Trained Qualification, they were given the\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n 23/87\n\n scale of Matric Trained Teachers by the concerned appointing\n\n authorities. In most of the cases, the candidates submitting the\n\n application for appointment as LSS teachers had declared his\n\n poverty, poor economic conditions, being widow, being divorcee\n\n or deserted by husband, etc. as such circumstances for their\n\n appointment to the post of LSS teachers which were considered\n\n and taken into account for their appointment on the\n\n recommendation of the politicians. So far as the petitioners in the\n\n first category are concerned, the petitioner, namely, Shamima\n\n Khatoon was served with a show cause notice pointing out that her\n\n appointment has been found irregular by the CBI and directions\n\n have been issued to take action in the light of the report of the\n\n CBI, therefore, she should submit her show cause within a period\n\n of three days. Vide memo no. 710 dated 01.10.2016, her service\n\n was terminated in view of the report of the CBI.\n\n 9. Similar orders were issued to the other writ petitioners\n\n and their services were terminated. It is stated that the order\n\n terminating the services of the petitioners were challenged in this\n\n Court vide C.W.J.C. No.17547 of 2016 and other analogues\n\n matters. All those writ applications came to be considered by the\n\n learned Writ Court. In C.W.J.C. No.17904 of 2016, this Court\n\n found that the decision making process was faulty, therefore, set\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n 24/87\n\n aside the order terminating the services of the petitioners and the\n\n same judgment was followed by the learned Writ Court in\n\n C.W.J.C. No.17438 of 2016 and other analogues cases. However,\n\n while disposing of the writ application, the learned Writ Court\n\n observed a follows:-\n\n \"This order, however, could not preclude the Regional\n Deputy Director of Education concerned to proceed afresh\n but in accordance with law and pass appropriate order after\n affording appropriate opportunity ...... The petitioners on\n being served notice would corporate in expeditious\n disposal of he matter.\"\n\n 10. After setting aside of the order of dismissal of the\n\n petitioners, they were reinstated in service and were paid their\n\n salaries.\n\n Fresh Steps- Show Cause Notices\n\n 11. The Regional Deputy Director (in short 'RDD'),\n\n however, once again issued show cause notice to the petitioners\n\n which the petitioners replied. By the order of the RDD, a\n\n departmental proceeding was initiated against the petitioners. The\n\n petitioners were made available a copy of the remarks made by the\n\n CBI and it was alleged that their initial appointment was made\n\n without advertisement, without roster clearance or without\n\n interview. A copy of the memo served upon the petitioner Smt.\n\n Shamima Khatoon has been placed on record and the same is\n\n being reproduced hereunder for a ready reference:-\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n 25/87\n\n \"vkjksi i=\n\n izi= *d*\n\n vkjksfir deZpkjh dk uke %& Jherh lehek [k+krqu\n inuke %& lgk;d f\"kf{kdk ¼fuEu voj f\"k{kk lsok½\n inLFkkiu dk LFkku %& e0 iz0 f\"k0 f\"k0 egkfo0 ¼vH;kl ikB\"kkyk½\n Qkjfclxat] vjf;k\n osrueku %& 9300&34800&4800@&\n fu;qfDr frfFk %& 10-02-1982\n lsok fuo`fr frfFk %& 31-12-2020\n\nØekad vjksi vkjksi dk fooj.k lk{;\n 01 fu;qfDr esa fcuk mfpr izfØ;k viuk, vkidh lh/kh fu;qfDr dh xbZA fdlh Lh0ch0vkbZ0 fjiksVZ\n vfu;ferrk LFkkuh; lekpkj i= ,oa fu;kstuky; }kjk bl in ds fy, dksbZ ¼dsUnzh; vUos'k.k C;wjks½ dk\n foKkiu ugha fudkyk x;kA jksLVj Dyh;jsUl izkIr ugha djk;k x;k vkSj tk¡p izfrosnu\n vkj{k.k fu;eksa dk vuqikyu ugha fd;k x;kA p;u lfefr }kjk fu;qfDr\n gsrq dksbZ vUrohZ{kk@tk¡p laca/kh dk;Zokgh ugha dh xbZA\n\n g0@&\n 28-08-2017\n\n Js=h; f\"k{kk mi funs\"kd]\n iwf.kZ;k¡ ize.My] iwf.kZ;k¡\"\n\n 12. The petitioners claimed that they appeared before the\n\n District Programme Officer and submitted that they were\n\n appointed pursuant to the notice published in the school. Their\n\n appointments have taken place against the sanctioned vacant post.\n\n The petitioner Shamima Khatoon, however, retired from service\n\n on 31.12.2020 during the pendency of the departmental\n\n proceeding. On 08.04.2021 the petitioner filed a second show\n\n cause reply, however, keeping aside the reply of the petitioner, the\n\n impugned order forfeiting the pensionary benefits of the\n\n petitioner and others was issued.

The impugned order has been assailed by the\n\n petitioners on the ground that the CBI has adopted a\n\n discriminatory approach in preparing and submitting the report\n\n dated 04.12.2004 which deals with the cases of 304 Teachers of\n\n LSS cadre. It is submitted that CBI has reported that 251 Assistant\n\n Teachers were irregularly appointed, appointment of 28 Teachers\n\n have been held regular, records of 17 Assistant Teachers were not\n\n available and the records of 3 Assistant Teachers who were\n\n terminated were not available. Similar was the case in respect of 5\n\n Assistant Teachers who were held irregular but the records were\n\n not available. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\n CBI has held 28 appointments as regular but in those appointments\n\n manifold irregularities are existing which are akin to the cases of\n\n 251 Teachers. According to the petitioners there is no basic\n\n difference in between the cases of said 28 Teachers and 251\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 28/87\n\n Teachers but the CBI held the appointment of said 28 Teachers as\n\n regular and thereby the appointment of the said 251 Teachers have\n\n been held as irregular. This has been called a completely arbitrary\n\n and discriminatory approach on the part of the CBI and that\n\n according to the petitioners would vitiate the report of the CBI.\n\n 14. It is submitted that one grave illegality which has\n\n been committed by the CBI is evident from bare perusal of the\n\n entries made in the 84 Assistant Teachers named at various serial\n\n numbers who have been declared as irregular appointees in spite of\n\n the fact that in concerned column of the said 84 Teachers, it has\n\n been clearly mentioned that \"records are not available\".\n\n 15. It is submitted that the order of punishment has been\n\n passed against the petitioners solely on the basis of the said CBI\n\n report dated 04.12.2004, therefore, the order of punishment is in\n\n the teeth of the order dated 19.09.2016 passed in C.W.J.C. No.\n\n 10002 of 2016 by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court. The\n\n petitioners relied upon the observations of the Hon'ble Division\n\n Bench of this Court wherein it has been stated that no termination\n\n of service of Teachers shall take place pursuant to the report of\n\n CBI without giving notices to the teacher(s) concerned and\n\n without following due process of law.\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 29/87\n\n \n16. It is submitted that the punishment orders are also\n\n in teeth of the judgment of this Court passed on 17.01.2017 in\n\n C.W.J.C. No. 17904 of 2016. (\nShanti Kumari Vs. State of Bihar\n\n & Ors\n.)\n\n 17. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the\n\n respondents have not acted in accordance with the Rule 17(4) and\n\n 17(5) of the Bihar Government Servants (Classification, Control\n\n & appeal) Rules 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Service\n\n Rules') in the matter of initiation of the departmental proceeding\n\n right from the stage of framing of memorandum of charge until the\n\n conclusion of the same and the same is in the teeth of the\n\n provisions of the Service Rules.\n\n 18. Learned counsel has also relied upon the statement\n\n made by CBI in paragraph '10' of its' affidavit dated 09.12.2019\n\n filed in WP(S) No. 5669 of 2018 before the Hon'ble Jharkhand\n\n High Court at Ranchi in which it is stated that the appointees\n\n were not examined during CBI inquiry. It is submitted that in case\n\n of similarly situated Teacher like these petitioners, the Hon'ble\n\n Jharkhand High Court had been pleased to allow WP (S) No. 6023\n\n of 2018 which has been affirmed by the Hon'ble Division bench of\n\n Jharkhand High Court vide order dated 02.03.2023 in L.P.A.No.\n\n 141 of 2021.\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 30/87\n\n 19. Learned counsel submits that on a bare perusal of the\n\n orders passed by the Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court it would\n\n appear that in the said case it has been held that as per Rule 97 (xi)\n\n of the Bihar Education Code, the District School Inspectress was\n\n the competent authority for appointment of Assistant Teachers in\n\n the pay-scale of Rs. 50-90/-\n\n \n20. It is further submitted that the charges levelled\n\n against the petitioners related to the periods of the year 1982\n\n onwards, therefore, no proceeding under the Bihar Pension Rules\n\n could have been initiated against the petitioners. Reliance in this\n\n regard has been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court in the case of \nState of M.P. v. Bani Singh\n reported in 1990\n\n Supp SCC 738, State of Andhra Pradesh Vs. N.\n\n Radhkrishnana reported in (1998) 4 SCC 154, Union of India\n\n and Ors. vs. Kishorill Bablani reported in \nAIR 1999 SC 517 and\n\n P.V. Mahadevan v. Managing Director, T.N. Housing Board\n\n reported in (2005) 6 SCC 636.\n\n 21. It is further submitted that after initial appointment\n\n of the petitioners, the authorities concerned had granted all due\n\n benefits to the petitioners like regular employees and the\n\n appointment of all the petitioners had been made by the\n\n competent authority against the sanctioned and vacant post as also\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 31/87\n\n they were having requisite qualifications for the post of Assistant\n\n Teachers (in LSS Cadre) they were appointed by virtue of Notice\n\n Board Advertisement.\n\n Stand of the Respondents\n\n 22. Contrary to the stand of the petitioners, the State-\n\n respondents have filed a counter affidavit in which the following\n\n stand has been taken:-\n\n (i). The petitioner has been duly proceeded against in a\n\n departmental proceeding and they have been given opportunity of\n\n hearing by serving show cause and affording opportunity to them\n\n to participate in the inquiry. The petitioners were also served with\n\n the inquiry report and second show cause notice was served upon\n\n them. It is submitted by the State-respondents that the impugned\n\n order has been passed under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules\n\n because the petitioner had retired on 31.12.2020. The departmental\n\n proceeding had been converted into a proceeding under Rule 43(b)\n\n of the Pension Rules vide memo no. 08 dated 05.01.2021 as\n\n contained in Annexure 'A' to the counter affidavit.\n\n 23. The State-respondents have submitted that the\n\n petitioners' appointment was done without proper advertisement in\n\n the local newspaper without any test or interview or without any\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 32/87\n\n roster clearance. It was a backdoor entry, they did not conform to\n\n \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India. The appointment\n\n was void ab-initio in law.\n\n \n24. Learned counsel for the State has submitted that the\n\n ratio of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\n \nState of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n (3) reported in (2006) 4 SCC 1\n\n clearly says that an appointment made contrary to \nArticles 14\n and\n\n \n21\n of the Constitution of India dehors the rules would be illegal\n\n appointments and those will be distinguishable from irregular\n\n appointments and they are like a still born child who can never be\n\n infused with life. Thus, the labelling of 'Irregular' Illegal or\n\n Regular appointments in its' report by CBI is not significant. These\n\n appointments are to be put in appropriate category as understood\n\n in legal parlance.\n\n \n25. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Full\n\n Bench of this Court in the case of \nRam Sevak Yadav vs. The\n\n State of Bihar and others\n reported in 2013 1 PLJR 964, learned\n\n counsel for the State submits that the Hon'ble Full Bench of this\n\n Court has declared that an illegal appointment void ab-initio made\n\n contrary to the mandate of \nArticle 14\n without open competitive\n\n selection process is void ab-initio and cannot be regularized under\n\n any circumstance.\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 33/87\n\n \n26. The State-respondents have further submitted that in\n\n C.W.J.C. No.9847 of 1998 (\nBrajesh Kumar Singh and others\n\n vs. State of Bihar and others\n), vide order dated 16.12.2019 there\n\n was a direction to the CBI to carry on an investigation in the\n\n matter of appointments/ promotion of LSS (women cadre) who\n\n were appointed from 1980 to 1998. CBI submitted its report on\n\n 09.11.2004 before the Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar,\n\n Patna against 305 teachers in which appointment of only 27\n\n teachers were found regular whereas appointment of 278 teachers\n\n were found to be illegal/ irregular, and therefore, recommendations\n\n were made for taking action against illegally/ irregularly appointed\n\n teachers and also against those officers who had made such\n\n appointments. As per report of the CBI, there was no\n\n advertisement in most of the cases, no roster clearance were\n\n obtained and no reservation rules were followed.\n\n 27. It is submitted that in the year 2011, the power and\n\n function of Inspectress of Schools-cum-Deputy Director of\n\n Education was merged with the post of Regional Deputy Director\n\n of Education. The Director, Seconday Education, Bihar, Patna\n\n issued a direction vide letter no. 1674 dated 17.08.2016 to all\n\n Regional Deputy Director of Education to locate such LSS\n\n teachers (women cadre) who were appointed during the period\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 34/87\n\n 1980-1998 and take legal action in accordance with law. Pursuant\n\n thereof, second show cause notice was issued to the petitioners and\n\n after careful consideration of the reply filed by the petitioners and\n\n scrutinizing the CBI report, the then Regional Deputy Director\n\n terminated the services of the petitioners which termination orders\n\n were challenged in several writs and those writ petitions were also\n\n heard together and orders of termination were set aside/ quashed.\n\n By virtue of termination, their services were restored but this\n\n reinstatement was with liberty granted to the respondents to\n\n proceed afresh in accordance with law.\n\n 28. It is submitted that one of the candidates in this\n\n regard, namely, Neelam Kumari (C.W.J.C. No.10022 of 2019)\n\n whose name appears at serial no. 186 in CBI report was appointed\n\n in 1977 by the District Inspectress (DI) who was not competent\n\n authority for the appointment. There was no select committee\n\n proceedings for her appointment through interview/ test. The post\n\n was not advertised in any newspaper. Her husband was assistant in\n\n the education department and in such circumstance, if the\n\n impugned order has been passed after giving appropriate\n\n opportunity of hearing to the petitioners, no fault may be found\n\n with the same. Referring to the facts of another similarly situated\n\n petitioner, namely, Shanti Kumari (C.W.J.C. No.3039 of 2019), it\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 35/87\n\n is submitted that she was appointed by DI who was not competent\n\n because LSS teachers is a State cadre post. The post was never\n\n advertised in any local newspaper. Her name appears at serial no.\n\n 205 of the CBI report. It has also been submitted that the\n\n departmental proceeding has been conducted in accordance with\n\n law and on the face of the facts which are crystal clear and are\n\n showing that these appointments were made without any\n\n advertisement and without their being any selection committee\n\n formed for this purpose, no prejudice would be caused to the\n\n petitioner if no witness was examined by the department in the\n\n departmental proceeding.\n\n 29. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\n principle of natural justice cannot be put in a straight jacket\n\n formula and this is one of those cases in which the facts are such\n\n that this Court can easily appreciate that their being no denial of\n\n the fact that there was no advertisement in the newspaper and the\n\n appointments were made without roster clearance and without\n\n their being any selection committee formed for this purpose to\n\n appoint the petitioners on the basis of interview, no prejudice\n\n would be caused to the petitioners as it is an open and shut case.\n\n On the aforesaid grounds, the State-respondents have submitted\n\n that the writ application are fit to be dismissed.\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 36/87\n\n As regards the judgment of the Hon'ble Jharkhand High\n\n Court, it is submitted that the same is clearly distinguishable and in\n\n any case the judgment would not be a binding precedent.\n\n Stand of the CBI\n\n 30. Let it be recorded that in course of hearing of these\n\n writ applications when this Court went through the records\n\n including the report of the CBI, learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n CBI was called upon to take a stand with regard to the nature of\n\n the cases found by the CBI particularly the distinction drawn by\n\n the CBI in its report between irregular and illegal appointments.\n\n Learned Senior Counsel for the CBI has assisted this Court by\n\n going into the records particularly the report of the CBI and\n\n learned Senior Counsel pointed out that the cases in which the\n\n appointments have been made on political recommendations\n\n without any advertisement and without their being any select\n\n committee and without there being any interview by such\n\n appointing authorities who had no authority to make regular\n\n appointments are definitely in the nature of illegal appointments.\n\n Consideration\n\n 31. Having heard learned counsel for the petitioners,\n\n learned counsel for the State and learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n CBI as also on going through the pleadings, this Court finds that\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 37/87\n\n writ petitioners are questioning the impugned orders passed by the\n\n State-respondents by which in exercise of power under Rule 43(b)\n\n of the Pension Rules, the pension as well as other retiral benefits\n\n of the petitioners have been forfeited.\n\n 32. The background of the present case would be\n\n evident from the submissions of the parties which have been taken\n\n note of hereinabove.\n\n 33. \nIn the case of \nShanti Kumari Vs. State of Bihar &\n\n Ors.\n this Court in its judgment dated 17.01.2017 in C.W.J.C. No.\n\n 17904 of 2016 inter alia observed as follows:-\n\n \"........Undisputedly the petitioners have been deprived of a\n reasonable opportunity to canvas their respective cases,\n produce relevant documents together with supporting case\n laws which could not be pressed into service, in the manner in\n which the matter has been conducted. My observations\n certainly would not bear a protection to such appointments\n which are plagued with fraud and obtained on forged\n documents, however this would require an examination thereof\n and individual case needs to be examined.\"\n\n (underline is mine)\n Further it is observed in concluding paragraph as under:\n\n \"Needless to add that in case the Regional Deputy Director\n of Education, Magadh Division, Gaya as well as Regional\n Deputy Director of Education of other Divisions would\n decide to re-initiate the proceeding and serve notice on the\n writ petitioners, they would cooperate in the expeditious\n disposal of the matter.\"\n\n 34. The petitioners were facing the charges that they\n\n were appointed without advertisement of the posts in a newspaper\n\n or to the employment exchange, the roster clearance were not\n\n available, reservation rules were not followed and there was no\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 38/87\n\n selection through a selection committee by conducting interview\n\n and/or verifying the records. They were appointed on the\n\n recommendation of the politicians. In the first round of litigation,\n\n the termination of the petitioners were set aside by this Court and\n\n they were ordered to be reinstated in service with consequential\n\n benefits even as the disciplinary proceeding against them were to\n\n proceed afresh. At this stage, this Court finds that the petitioners in\n\n fact got benefit of their salary etc. even as the validity of their\n\n appointments were yet to be tested, examined and an appropriate\n\n view was to be taken. In this regard, the Hon'ble Constitution\n\n Bench judgment in the case of Managing Director, ECIL,\n\n Hyderabad Versus B. Karunakar and Others reported in (1993)\n\n 4 SCC 727 may be referred to. Paragraph '31' of the judgment is\n\n being reproduced here under for ready reference:-\n\n \"31. Hence, in all cases where the enquiry officer's report\n is not furnished to the delinquent employee in the\n disciplinary proceedings, the Courts and Tribunals should\n cause the copy of the report to be furnished to the\n aggrieved employee if he has not already secured it before\n coming to the Court/Tribunal and give the employee an\n opportunity to show how his or her case was prejudiced\n because of the non-supply of the report. If after hearing the\n parties, the Court/Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the\n non-supply of the report would have made no difference to\n the ultimate findings and the punishment given, the\n Court/Tribunal should not interfere with the order of\n punishment. The Court/Tribunal should not mechanically\n set aside the order of punishment on the ground that the\n report was not furnished as is regrettably being done at\n present. The courts should avoid resorting to short cuts.\n Since it is the Courts/Tribunals which will apply their\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 39/87\n\n judicial mind to the question and give their reasons for\n setting aside or not setting aside the order of punishment,\n (and not any internal appellate or revisional authority),\n there would be neither a breach of the principles of natural\n justice nor a denial of the reasonable opportunity. It is only\n if the Court/Tribunal finds that the furnishing of the report\n would have made a difference to the result in the case that\n it should set aside the order of punishment. Where after\n following the above procedure, the Court/Tribunal sets\n aside the order of punishment, the proper relief that should\n be granted is to direct reinstatement of the employee with\n liberty to the authority/management to proceed with the\n inquiry, by placing the employee under suspension and\n continuing the inquiry from the stage of furnishing him\n with the report. The question whether the employee would\n be entitled to the back-wages and other benefits from the\n date of his dismissal to the date of his reinstatement if\n ultimately ordered, should invariably be left to be decided\n by the authority concerned according to law, after the\n culmination of the proceedings and depending on the final\n outcome. If the employee succeeds in the fresh inquiry and\n is directed to be reinstated, the authority should be at\n liberty to decide according to law how it will treat the\n period from the date of dismissal till the reinstatement and\n to what benefits, if any and the extent of the benefits, he\n will be entitled. The reinstatement made as a result of the\n setting aside of the inquiry for failure to furnish the report,\n should be treated as a reinstatement for the purpose of\n holding the fresh inquiry from the stage of furnishing the\n report and no more, where such fresh inquiry is held. That\n will also be the correct position in law.\"\n\n 35. In the fresh round of disciplinary proceeding, the\n\n petitioner(s) were served with Prapatra 'K' ¼izi= d½. Inquiry was\n\n conducted into the matter and after consideration of the stand of\n\n the petitioners what ultimately transpired in the inquiry report may\n\n be summerised as under:\n\n (i) No advertisement had been issued by the Inspectress\n\n of School-cum-Deputy Director of Education, Bihar for the\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 40/87\n\n purpose of appointment of teachers in the subordinate service\n\n cadre.\n\n (ii) The petitioners only claimed that there were\n\n information on the notice board of the office of the Inspectress of\n\n School-cum-Deputy Director of Education, Bihar, it is not their\n\n stand that the posts were advertised and the public at large who\n\n were eligible for appointment as teacher had opportunity to apply\n\n for the said post.\n\n (iii) As regards, roster clearance and observance of the\n\n principles of reservation are concerned, this is also not in dispute,\n\n and\n\n (iv) The petitioners failed to produce any letter of a\n\n selection committee or any competent authority calling upon them\n\n to appear for interview.\n\n \n36. In course of hearing of C.W.J.C. No.1690 of 1997\n\n which was filed by Smt. Shushma Kumari and other primary\n\n teachers claiming pay benefits for the period 20.07.1985 to\n\n 17.05.1990, the then Director, Secondary Education, Bihar filed a\n\n reply contending that the lady teachers appointed during the period\n\n from 1980 onwards were appointed illegally and consequently the\n\n promotion given to them was also irregular. This Court was\n\n informed that the matter of appointment/ promotion of these\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 41/87\n\n teachers was under investigation with Cabinet Vigilance\n\n Department and the Government of Bihar had set up an inquiry\n\n committee to inquire into the matter. This Court vide order\n\n date19.09.1997 directed the Government of Bihar to take final\n\n decision in the matter. An inquiry was also started by the Cabinet\n\n Vigilance Investigation Bureau, Bihar. While the said inquiry was\n\n in progress, in C.W.J.C. No.9847 of 1998 (\nBrajesh Kumar and\n\n others vs. State of Bihar and others\n) this Court issued directions\n\n to the CBI to take up the investigation into the matter of\n\n appointments of primary teachers and other teachers in the State of\n\n Bihar from 1980 till date. It is in these facts and circumstances,\n\n the CBI Anti Corruption Branch registered the preliminary inquiry\n\n No.3 (A/01) dated 08.06.2001.\n\n 37. The preliminary inquiry revealed that Inspectress of\n\n Schools-cum-Deputy Director, Secondary Education, Bihar\n\n provided a list of 305 teachers of LSS (women wing) whose\n\n appointments were said to be illegal/irregular. The name of the\n\n authorities who had appointed them were also provided. Another\n\n list of 160 LSS teachers allegedly illegally/ irregularly promoted\n\n during 1990 by late Dr. Sachita Kumar Sinha the then Director,\n\n Secondary Education, Bihar was also obtained by the CBI.\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 42/87\n\n 38. The CBI in its report has scrutinized the rules\n\n governing the LSS teachers and circulars which were issued by the\n\n Government of Bihar from time to time.

RECOMMENDATORY There are no provisions, no procedure\n APPOINTMENTS and no circulars for such appointments\n\n For the purposes of promotion of LSS Teacher to the grade of SEX, the relevant rules and\nprocedure as applicable are summarised as below :-\n\n1. Appointing Authority :- Director, Secondary Education Bihar is the appointing authority of SES Teachers both\n for direct recruitment as well as through promotion from LSS to SES (Rule 796 Bihar Education Code 1961 and\n Letter No. 11/MZZ/03/63E-4484 dt. 8.12.65).\n\n2. Direct Recruitment :- It is to be made through State Selection Board /Vidyalaya\n Sewa Board.\n\n3. Promotions :- For promotion from LSS teacher to SES teacher, 50% of the total post will be filled by direct\n recruitment and 50 % of the vacancies will be filled by promotion from amongst the LSS teachers as per letter\n No. 27 dt 7.1.76 of Education Department.\"\n\n 39. It is evident from the relevant Rules and the\n\n Circulars which have been issued from time to time that the\n\n Director, Secondary Education, Bihar is the appointing authority\n\n of the Subordinate Education Services Teachers (hereinafter\n\n referred to a the 'SES Teachers') both by direct recruitment as well\n\n as through promotion from 'LSS' to 'SES' (Refer Rule 796 of the\n\n Bihar Education Code 1961 and letter No. 11/M 22/03/63 E-4484\n\n dated 08.12.1965). It is also evident that the direct recruitment is\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 45/87\n\n to be made through State Selection Board/Vidayalay Sewa Board.\n\n The Director, Secondary Education is only competent to approve a\n\n select list for appointment in LSS (women cadre). A\n\n compassionate appointment may be made in 'SES' Scale directly\n\n as and when cleared by the government through Department of\n\n Personal and Administrative Reforms.\n\n 40. As regards the appointment of the 305 LSS\n\n Teachers, the CBI got 234 appointment folders and scrutinized the\n\n same. Some of the appointees were also examined to ascertain the\n\n procedure adopted towards their appointment as LSS Teachers.\n\n This inquiry revealed that these appointments of LSS Teachers\n\n (women wing) were made by 46 appointing authorities during the\n\n period from 1980 to 1998. They were the Inspectress of School-\n\n cum-Deputy Director, Secondary Education, Bihar who made\n\n maximum number of 108 appointments during period 1980-86.\n\n One Smt. Sudha Sinha the Inspectress of School, Bihar who was\n\n the District Inspectress School (in short 'DI') at Patna at the\n\n relevant time made 57 appointments during the period\n\n 05.07.1988 to 15.01.1990 and 1987 to 1988 respectively. In this\n\n manner all the 46 Inspectress of School, Deputy Director\n\n Education, Director, Secondary Education and District Inspectress\n\n of School were involved in making appointments without carrying\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 46/87\n\n any selection process. A large number of them had died at the time\n\n the CBI was conducting inquiry.\n\n (underline is mine)\n\n 41. As regards the procedures related to appointment\n\n what has been revealed in the inquiry report of the CBI are being\n\n taken verbatimly from the said report as under:-\n\n\"The enquiry has further revealed that the procedure related to the appointments of LSS teachers is governed\nby GO No.I-D-306-58E-1 382D dated 17.3.59 and \nArticle 64 (1\n \n& 3)\n of Bihar Education Code, \nArticle 3\n of BB Misc.\nRules, 1958, Rule 796 of Bihar Education code and notification 262 dated 2.6.86 according to which Inspectress\nof Schools of Bihar and/or Director of Secondary Education, Bihar is the appointing authority of LSS teachers.\nClause 2 of Article-64 of Bihar Education Code lays down that, in the event of an urgent and unforeseen\nvacancy, the Inspectress may make temporary appointment of a teacher without prior reference to the Director\nfor a period not exceeding three months. In view of the aforesaid provision, only the Inspectress of Schools was\nempowered to make temporary appointment only for three months. In letter No. 8167 dated 21.6.66 issued by\nSecretary to the Government of Bihar, it is laid down that all recruitments to the vacancies to be filled up by the\nState Government will be channelised compulsorily through the Employment Exchange except the vacancies\nwhich were to be filled up on the recommendation of the Bihar Public Service Commission or by promotion or\ntransfer or deputation specifically mentioning therein that the other source of recruitment will be tried only\nwhen the Employment Exchange concerned issues a non-availability certificate.\n\n The enquiry has further revealed that in the matter of illegal/irregular appointment of 305 LSS\nteachers, the original applications of most of the candidates are addressed either to the inspectress of Schools,\nBihar, Patna or to the State Education Minister, Bihar. The said applications contain the recommendations made\nby politicians like MLA's/ MLC's other Ministers/ Distt. Educational Authorities and were endorsed to the\nInpectress of School, Bihar, Patna for taking necessary action and/or for making appointment as Primary\nTeacher. These recommendations of the politicians or the then Education Minister were treated as Government\norders by the Inspectress of Schools, Bihar/Distt. Inspectress of Schools and they without following the\nprescribed procedure directly issued appointment orders in favour of the recommended candidates, making\nappointment in a temporary capacity for a period ranging between 3 to 6 months against a temporary vacancy\ncreated by any regular teachers going on maternity/sick/long leave. The prescribed procedure, relevant rules,\nand circulars issued by the Government of Bihar from time to time for such appointments were not followed by\nthe concerned appointing authority while making the appointments. \nArticle 64 (3-i)\n of Bihar Education Code\nempowers Inspectress of Schools to make temporary emergency appointments for 3 months without following\nthe required procedure but there is no provision to grant extension to such temporary teachers or to reappoint.\nThe enquiry however, has revealed that in almost all the cases repeated extensions were given and re-\nappointment letters were issued. Under \nArticle 64 (3-iii)\n, the Inspectress of Schools was required to furnish to\nthe Director Secondary Education, Bihar by the 16 th of April, of every calendar year, the particulars of\nqualifications, categories, etc, of all vacancies that were likely to occur within the following year, and wherein\nregular appointments were required to be made by following the proper procedure but this rule was not\nfollowed. No advertisement for the posts was ever made in the local newspaper nor the names were called\nthrough the regional Employment Exchange as was required under the rules. No Establishment/ Select\nCommittee was constituted to conduct test/interview to prepare a select list of the qualified and deserving\ncandidates to make recommendations for appointment of the successful candidates for the vacant posts of LSS\nteachers. No roster clearance regarding reservation of vacancies for each category for the post of general\nteachers, music teachers and craft teachers was obtained from DP & AR through Director Secondary Education\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 47/87\n\nprior to advertising the vacancies, if any, in the local newspaper/employment exchange. Contrary to the laid\ndown procedure, direct appointment letters were issued on the basis of recommendations of\npoliticians/authorities as mentioned in the Chart on\nAnalysis of Available Record and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.\n\n The enquiry has also revealed that in certain cases the applicants who did not possess the required\nqualifications of Matric Trained Teachers, were appointed in the lower scale of matric untrained teachers but\nsubsequently upon acquiring the matric trained qualifications, they were given the scale of matric trained\nteachers by the concerned appointing authority. It has also been revealed that in most of the cases, the\ncandidates submitting the applications for appointment as LSS teachers had declared self poverty, poor\neconomic conditions, being widow, being divorcee or deserted by husband etc. as special circumstances for\ntheir appointment to the post of LSS teachers, which grounds were considered and taken into account for their\nappointments.\n\n The enquiry has further revealed that in March, 1988 an advertisement had appeared in the local\ndaily newspapers issued by Inspectress of Schools, Bihar inviting applications for the posts of\ngeneral/music/craft teachers in LSS grade. A number of applications were received in response to the said\nadvertisement. However, no teacher of General category whosoever had applied for the post was\nselected/appointed, though certain candidates were appointed for the post of General teacher whose\napplications were received duly recommended by the politicians. It is also revealed that no roster clearance for\nthe reservation of vacancies so advertised was obtained. A few number of craft/music and dance teachers were\nselected and given appointments as LSS teachers on the recommendations of a Select Committee constituted\nfor this purpose. As such these appointments have been shown as regular appointments in Chart of Analysis of\nAvailable Record and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report.\n\n The enquiry has revealed that the post of LSS teachers (Primary Teacher's) in Government Girls Schools of\nBihar is under the direct control and supervision of Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna and is State cadre post\nand its appointing as well as disciplinary authority is Inspectress of Schools - cum - Dy. Director Secondary\nEducation, Bihar. However, on a number of occasions, in a number of cases Distt. Inspectresses of Schools of\nvarious districts of Bihar, who are not appointing authorities for LSS teachers were also allowed to make\nappointments of LSS teachers in Government Girls Schools within their respective districts. It is further revealed\nthat some of the teachers appointed prior to 1980 were appointed in similar manner in temporary capacity for\n3 months without following the proper procedure by the then Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna as has been\nfollowed by the Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna in this case during 1980 -98. The Distt. Inspectresses of\nSchools of the relevant districts have also made appointments/re appointments of LSS teachers in temporary\ncapacity for 3-6 months without following the proper procedure and have also granted repeated extensions to\nsuch temporary appointees against the rules. The Distt. Inspectress of Schools is not an authorised appointing\nauthority of LSS teachers and hence all the appointments made by Distt. Inspectresses of Schools during 1980\n\n-98 in their districts have been shown as irregular appointments in the Chart of Analysis of Available Record and\nEvidence enclosed as annexure to this report.\n The enquiry has revealed that out of 305 appointments so made, no record is available in respect of 25\nappointments. The Chart of Analysis of Available Record' and Evidence enclosed as annexure to this report\nreveals different irregularities committed by the said 46 appointing authorities, such as non-obtaining of roster\nclearance, non-advertisement of posts/vacancies in daily newspapers/ regional employment. exchange, non-\ncalling of names of the candidates through regional employment exchanges, non- observance of age limits.\nnon-observance of training/ educational qualification, non-observance of prescribed procedure, making\nappointments on the recommendations of politicians like MLAs, MLCS, Chief Minister, Education Minister, other\nMinisters and other authorities without following the prescribed procedure and making of appointments by\nunauthorised/ incompetent authorities etc.\n The enquiry has revealed that Distt. Inspectresses of Schools of the relevant districts have also made\nappointments/ reappointments of LSS teachers in temporary capacity for 3-6 months without following the\nproper procedure and have also granted repeated extensions to such temporary appointees against the rules.\nThe Distt. Inspectress of Schools is not an authorised appointing authority of LSS teachers and hence all the\nappointments made by Distt. Inspectresses of Schools during 1980-98 in their districts have been concluded as\nirregular appointments in the Chart of Analysis of Available Record and. Evidence enclosed as annexure to this\nreport. It has also come to light that under \nArticle 97(xi)\n of Bihar Education Code, under the head of Powers of\nDistt Inspectresses of Schools, it has been laid down that District Inspectress of Schools is empowered to \"make\nappointment of Class-IV Government, Servant and of teachers in the scale of 50 - 90 or below under her control\nand to sanction pension to all such cases\". This power given to the Distt. Inspectresses. has been misunderstood\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 48/87\n\nas the appointing power of LSS teachers. However, The Distt. Inspectress of Schools cannot be the appointing\nauthority of LSS teachers due to the below mentioned reasons :-\n\n i. LSS teacher's post is a State Cadre Post under the direct control and supervision of\n Inspectresses of Schools Bihar, Patna who is the appointing authority for this post\n under \narticle 64 (1-3).\n\n ii. There can not be two appointing authorities for the same post i.e. Inspectress of\n Schools, Bihar and the District Inspectress of Schools.\n\n iii. District Inspectresses are posted in the relevant districts under the control of\n Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna to assist her in the work of control and\n supervision of Government Girls Schools of Bihar and a person posted in a district\n can not be the appointing authority of a state cadre post.\n\n iv. The required Roster Register and seniority list of LSS teachers is being maintained\n by the Inspectress of Schools Bihar, Patna under supervision of Director Secondary\n Education, Bihar whereas no such register and seniority list can be maintained' at a\n district level for a State Cadre Post.\n\n v. The power of Distt. Inspectress under \narticle: 97(xi)\n has been provided in respect of\n Take Over Girls Schools, if any, in her district. Now this power in respect of\n appointment in Take Over Schools is vested in a committee constituted under\n District Education Officer/ Superintendent.\n\n vi. The Hon'ble High Court of Jharkhand vide its order dated 9.6.2002 passed in CWJC\n No. 1110 and 1119 of 1995 had held that \"neither the education code nor any of\n the rules empowers Distt. Inspectress of Schools to be the appointing authority in\n respect of appointment to the post of Matric Trained Teachers. The appointment of\n the petitioners by the Distt. Inspectress of Schools is illegal and wholly without\n jurisdiction\".\n\n vii. The appointing authority of a post is always the disciplinary authority of that post\n and vice-versa. The disciplinary authority in case of LSS teachers is Inspectress of\n Schools Bihar, Patna and not the Distt. Inspectress.\"\n\n (underline is mine)\n\n 42. What surprised to this Court is that even though the\n\n CBI in its' preliminary report found that huge number of illegal\n\n appointments had been made contrary to the Rules which had in\n\n fact resulted in undue enrichment to the illegally appointed\n\n Teachers, the CBI did not register a regular case to prosecute\n\n them and got contented by recommending the department\n\n concerned as under:-\n\n \"4. CONCLUSION :\n\n In view of the facts, circumstances and evidence discussed above, the matter is being referred to the\n department with the recommendations as under :-\n\n i) Suitable Action as deemed fit against the appointees who have been irregularly appointed to be\n taken by the Director, Secondary Education, Government of Bihar.\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 49/87\n\nii) Suitable Action as deemed fit against Smt. Shanti Devi, inspectress of School, Bihar, Smt.\n Prabhavati Kumar, Inspectress of School, Bihar, Smt. Manju Singh, Distt. Inspectress of School,\n Bhojpur - Rohtas, ms. Meena Kumari Rai, Distt, inspectress of School, Bhojpur and Smt, Neeta\n Kumari Pandey, Distt. Inspectress of School, Singhbuoom for making irregular appointments of\n LSS teachers.\n\niii) The Government of Bihar may initiate suitable measures to bring about system improvement in\n the appointment of teachers and their monitoring by higher authority to ensure that such lapses as\n have figured out in the present enquiry for not occur in future.\"\n\n \n43. Despite submission of the CBI report revealing\n\n startling facts and then recommendation to the State Authorities,\n\n no action was taken for obvious reason. Right from the then\n\n Politicians to the Assistant in the Education Department and a\n\n large number of officers who had made illegal appointments were\n\n likely to suffer the consequences of legal action. The CBI report\n\n was dumped. The State respondents at a much belated stage\n\n proceeded to take action only after the Hon'ble Division Bench of\n\n this Court passed an order dated 19.09.2016 in C.W.J.C. No.\n\n 10002 of 2016 (\nKaushal Kumar Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.\n).\n\n The Hon'ble Division Bench having noticed that no action had\n\n been taken by the State respondents on the report of the CBI called\n\n upon the Principle Secretary of the Department, the Director,\n\n Secondary Education, Regional Deputy Director of Education,\n\n Magadh Division, Gaya to appear in Court. Subsequently, the\n\n Hon'ble Division Bench was informed that actions have been\n\n taken by the State upon recommendation of the CBI which are\n\n now subject matter of large number of the individual writ petitions.\n\n Taking note of it, the Hon'ble Division Bench observed that as\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 50/87\n\n State has taken action, the writ petition had outlived its purpose. It\n\n was, thus, permitted to be withdrawn.\n\n 44. In this manner despite the fact that the department\n\n was well aware about the illegal appointments made during the\n\n period 1980-98 and in fact an affidavit to this effect had been filed\n\n in C.W.J.C. No. 1690 of 1997 itself, the fact remains that inquiry\n\n which was initiated by the Cabinet (Vigilance) went in the hand of\n\n the CBI and the CBI registered a preliminary inquiry in the year\n\n 2001 which ended in submission of a preliminary report sometime\n\n in the year 2004 but no action was taken by the department\n\n pursuant to the revelation made in the preliminary inquiry report\n\n of the CBI forwarded to the State Chief Secretary vide confidential\n\n Letter No. 3937 dated 3071-04. This shows complete inaction on\n\n the part of the State respondents and calls upon this Court to take a\n\n view that there were concerted efforts inside the Department itself\n\n to delay any action against the petitioners and similarly situated\n\n illegal appointees and others involved in this racket of illegal\n\n appointments and it was done in order to confer them legitimacy\n\n by continuing in service for long years. The public money kept on\n\n flowing by way of salary, perks and other emoluments to the\n\n illegally appointed Teachers who enjoyed the benefit of service.\n\n \n45. In this Court, the petitioners have raised a submission\n\n that the CBI report discriminates among the various Teachers whose\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 51/87\n\n appointments have been scrutinized by calling some of them illegal\n\n appointees whereas the others as irregular appointees. This Court need\n\n not detain itself on this issue because what is illegal appointment and\n\n what would be irregular appointment in legal parlance have been well\n\n discussed by the Hon'ble Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in the\n\n case of \nUma Devi\n (supra). The appointments which have taken place\n\n without there being any advertisement, without sanction post, by the\n\n authorities who are not competent to make regular appointments and\n\n without there by any selection committee are illegal appointments and it\n\n does not matter if any one else says or claims that it will be a case of\n\n irregular appointment. Something which is illegal cannot be regularized\n\n and this issue is no longer a res intgra.\n\n 46. \nIn a recent judgment in the case of the \nState of Bihar v.\n\n Devendra Sharma\n reported in (2020) 15 SCC 466, the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court was dealing with the cases of illegal appointments in the\n\n Health Department of the State of Bihar against Class III and Class IV\n\n Posts. About six thousands employees appointed by one Dr. Mallick the\n\n then Assistant Director in the Health Department had been terminated.\n\n Those were challenged on the ground of violation of Principle of\n\n Natural Justice.\n \nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the said\n\n matter noticed the views of the Constitution Bench in the case of \nUma\n\n Devi\n (supra) and held that in \nUma Devi\n (supra) the submission that the\n\n employees had legitimate expectations was negated. In paragraph '46\n\n of the judgment it has been held as under:-\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 52/87\n\n \"46. ... The doctrine can be invoked if the decisions of the\n administrative authority affect the person by depriving him of\n some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past\n been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can\n legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there\n have been communicated to him some rational grounds for\n withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to\n comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-\n\n maker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him first an\n opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should\n not be withdrawn. ... There is no case that any assurance was\n given by the Government or the department concerned while\n making the appointment on daily wages that the status conferred\n on him will not be withdrawn until some rational reason comes\n into existence for withdrawing it. The very engagement was\n against the constitutional scheme.......\"\n\n \n47. The Hon'ble Supreme Court referred the \nState of\n\n Mysore v. S.V. Narayanappa\n reported in (1967) 1 SCR 128 : \nAIR\n\n 1967 SC 1071, R.N. Nanjundappa v. T. Thimmiah\n reported in (\n1972)\n\n 1 SCC 409 and B.N. Nagarajan v. State of Karnataka\n reported in\n\n (1979) 4 SCC 507 and held that there may be cases where irregular\n\n appointments (not illegal appointments) may be made as explained in\n\n those judgments.\n\n \n48. The Hon'ble Supreme Court then approved the Full\n\n Bench Judgment of Patna High Court in the case of \nRita Misha Vs.\n\n Director, Primary Education\n reported in (AIR 1988 Pat 26) wherein\n\n the question posed before the Hon'ble Full Bench was whether a public\n\n servant was entitled to payment of salary to him for the work done\n\n despite the fact that his letter of appointment was forged, fraudulent or\n\n illegal. The Hon'ble Full Bench held as under:-\n\n \"13. It is manifest from the above that the rights to salary, pension\n and other service benefits are entirely statutory in nature in public\n service. Therefore, these rights, including the right to salary,\n spring from a valid and legal appointment to the post. Once it is\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 53/87\n\n found that the very appointment is illegal and is non est in the eye\n of the law, no statutory entitlement for salary or consequential\n rights of pension and other monetary benefits can arise. In\n particular, if the very appointment is rested on forgery, no\n statutory right can flow from it.\"\n\n \n49. The Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed an another Full\n\n Bench judgment of this Court in the case of \nRam Sewak Yadav Vs.\n\n The State of Bihar &Ors.\n reported in (2013) 1 PLJR 964 (FB)\n\n wherein the appellants were appointed on class IV post by the Civil\n\n Surgeon in the Health Department but their services were terminated for\n\n the reasons that their appointments were illegal. The Hon'ble Full\n\n Bench of this Court held in paragraph '41' as under:-\n\n \"41. The public power to make appointment on public posts is\n conferred for public good. The power is given to the officer\n concerned by the Government in trust, that it shall be used and not\n abused. If the trust is belied, the protection conferred upon a\n government servant stands denuded. The answerability and\n accountability is then individual of the officer. The Government is\n duty-bound to take appropriate civil/criminal action against the\n officer. The illegality in the appointment is not a one way street. If\n there was someone willing to pay a price for the job, there was\n another waiting to take advantage of the same by fixing a price. It\n is not without reason that majority of such appointments relate to\n Class III and IV posts. The standard by which the Government\n professes to act is the same standard by which its actions shall be\n judged. Therefore whenever the Government terminates an\n appointment being illegal, it is the constitutional duty of the\n Government to simultaneously take action against the officials who\n belied the trust of the Government. Those who made hay while the\n sun shined must see the darker cloudy days also. ......\"\n\n 50.

In the facts of the matter, when this Court examined the\n\n submissions made on behalf of the petitioners, it is found that these\n\n petitioners were given ample opportunity of hearing. They were served\n\n with the Memo of Charge and were allowed to participate in the inquiry.\n\n They were also served with the copy of inquiry report and were given\n\n time to submit their show cause. Thus, the principle of natural justice\n\n have been fully complied with. No violation of procedure estabished by\n\n law could be shown to this Court. The petitioners, in fact, admit that\n\n there was no advertisement in any newspaper. They claim that the posts\n\n were advertised through the notice pasted in the office of the DI but this\n\n would not come to their rescue. These are the cases of backdoor\n\n appointments and, hence, the appointment of the petitioners and\n\n continuance in service for all these years would not fetch any advantage\n\n in their favour. None of the petitioners have in fact dislodged the\n\n finding of illegal appointment. They are not able to establish that their\n\n appointments were legal and valid in all respects. The credible findings\n\n in the CBI report are in fact not contested on any cogent ground.\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 62/87\n\n 52. \nIn the case of \nDevendra Sharma\n (supra), the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court has approved the view of the Hon'ble Full\n\n Bench in the case of \nRam Sevak Yadav\n (supra) that illegal\n\n appointment which are void ab initio cannot be regularised in any\n\n circumstances and question of regularization of their services even\n\n by interpreting paragraph '44' of the judgment in the case of\n\n \nUmadevi\n (3) (supra) would not arise.\n\n 53. To this Court, it appears that these appointments are\n\n akin to and stand on similar footing with that of those Class III and\n\n Class IV employees who were appointed by Dr Mallick in the\n\n Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme which were held ex facie illegal.\n\n \nIn fact in the cases of those appointees, the Court while dealing\n\n with the submissions of the terminated employees in the case of\n\n \nAshwani Kumar and Others v. State of Bihar and Others\n\n reported in (1997) 2 SCC 1, held that those recruitments were\n\n arbitrary, capricious and null and void after considering the\n\n Government Order dated December 3, 1980 as well as\n\n Government Resolution dated March 25, 1983. It was also held\n\n that none of the appointees have any accrued right in the absence\n\n of sanctioned post and the whole exercise remained in the realm of\n\n an unauthorised adventure. It was held that army of the employees\n\n of the Scheme had got to be cleared lock, stock and barrel so that\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 63/87\n\n public confidence in Government administration would not get\n\n shattered and arbitrary actions would not get sanctified. In these\n\n cases also the Government order and provisions of the Bihar\n\n Education Code have been relied upon to show the appointments\n\n of these petitioners being wholly illegal and bad in Law.\n\n 54. The Principles of nature justice stand fully complied\n\n with and the petitioners cannot be allowed to take advantage of\n\n their continuance over all these years when the inquiry into these\n\n appointments was kept pending because all high-ups were\n\n allegedly involved in this scam of illegal appointments.\n\n \n55. Reliance placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\n Jharkhand High Court in the case of \nSushma Kumari @ Sushma\n\n Kumari Devi versus the State of Jharkhand and Others\n (W.P.\n\n (S) No. 6023 of 2018) is wholly misconceived. In the said case, as\n\n it appears from the judgment itself, the fact was that there was an\n\n advertisement notice on 21.09.1988 and a three member selection\n\n committee had been constituted for appointment of matric trained\n\n teacher. Petitioner was appointed through the selection process. No\n\n adverse remarks were made by CBI and CBI only recorded that the\n\n \"records were not available\". In the said case, the Deputy Director\n\n of Education had issued Order No. 4161 dated 22.04.1989,\n\n therefore, it was held not a case of back door appointment. It is\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 64/87\n\n evident from bare reading of the Judgment of the Jharkhand High\n\n Court that the facts of the said case were quite different and\n\n distinct.\n\n \n56. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the he\n\n judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nRoop Singh\n\n Negi versus Punjab National Bank and Others\n reported in (2009) 2\n\n SCC 570 in the case of \nUnion of India & Ors. v. B.V. Gopinath\n\n reported in (2014) 1 SCC 351 to submit that in this case the State\n\n respondents have not acted in consonance with the principles of\n\n natural justice. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the charges\n\n levelled against the delinquent officer must be found to have been\n\n proved and the enquiry officer has a duty to arrive at a finding upon\n\n taking into consideration the materials brought on record by the parties.\n\n The submission is that purported evidence collected during the\n\n investigation by the Investigating Officer against all the accused by\n\n itself would not be treated to be evidence in the disciplinary\n\n proceeding. Submission is that in this case no departmental witness\n\n appeared to prove the contents of the inquiry, therefore, it could not\n\n have been treated as evidence.\n \nAt first instance the submission appears\n\n impressive but then this Court is reminded of the judgment of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nBharat Petroleum Corpn. Ltd.\n\n v. N.R. Vairamani\n reported in (2004) 8 SCC 579 wherein the Hon'ble\n\n Supreme Court has held that the judgment of the court cannot be cited\n\n like an Euclid's theorem because a slight change in the facts of the case\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 65/87\n\n would make a sea difference in the opinion of the court.\n \nIn the case of\n\n \nRoop Singh Negi\n (supra) there was an allegation against the delinquent\n\n employee who was working as Manager in the branch office of the\n\n Bank at Chandni Chauk, Delhi that he was responsible for the loss of\n\n drawing book of which one of the two employees had been the\n\n custodians and that the loss of drawing book would have been avoided\n\n had they taken the due care and precaution. The employer had lodged a\n\n first information report and after five years when the disciplinary\n\n proceeding was initiated, the documents collected by the Investigating\n\n officer were simply produced and the inquiry officer concluded that the\n\n petitioner Roop Singh Negi had direct or indirect links with the culprits.\n\n The criminal court had already passed an order of discharge against the\n\n petitioner and it was brought to the notice of the inquiry officer but the\n\n same was not considered.\n \nIn this background the judgment of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court has been rendered in the case of \nRoop Singh\n\n Negi\n (supra). The facts of the present case are that of a mass scale\n\n illegal appointments by incompetent officers of the State on the\n\n recommendation of the politicians without any advertisement and\n\n without any selection committee for the purpose. In these\n\n circumstances, it is not only the CBI report which is the basis for\n\n arriving at a conclusion that the appointment of the petitioners\n\n (Category I and II for the present) is illegal rather the appointments\n\n were also against the relevant government circulars and the provisions\n\n of the Bihar Education Code. This is in the nature of scam and in such\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 66/87\n\n cases, it appears to this Court that 'situational modifications' with\n\n regard to application of principle of natural justice would be\n\n permissible.\n \nIn this regard this Court would quote the relevant part of\n\n the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nMohinder\n\n Singh Gill and Anr. Vs. The Chief Election Commissioner, New\n\n Delhi and Ors\n reported in AIR 1978 SC 851 wherein while dealing\n\n with the issue of prejudice and the burden to prove prejudice, the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that the Court may not be taken to\n\n say that \"situational modifications to notice and hearing are altogether\n\n impermissible. They are, as the learned Addl. Solicitor-General rightly\n\n stressed. The glory of the law is not that sweeping rules are laid down\n\n but that it tailors principles to practical needs, doctors remedies to suit\n\n the patient, promotes, not freezes, life's processes, if we may mix\n\n metaphors.\"\n Tucker, LJ drove home this point when he observed in the\n\n Duke of Norfolk case (1949) 1 All ER 109) in the following words:-\n\n \"There are no words which are of universal application to every\n kind of inquiry .... The requirements of natural justice must\n depend 14on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the\n inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject-\n matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.\"\n\n \nThis circumstantial flexibility of fair hearing has been\n underscored in \nWiseman v. Borneman\n (1971) AC 297 by Lord\n Reid when he said he would be \"sorry to see this fundamental\n general principle degenerate into a series of hard-and-fast rules\".\n\n \n57. This Court therefore, finds that the judgments of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of \nRoop Singh Negi\n (supra) and \nB.\n\n V. Gopinath\n (supra) has not laid down a hard and fast rule and would\n\n not be applicable in the facts situation of the present case.\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 67/87\n\n \n58. Learned counsel has relied upon some judgments of this\n\n Court rendered by learned co-ordinate Benches of this Court in the case\n\n of \nMamta Verma Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors. (C.W.J.C. No.\n \n9149\n\n of 2022) and Kumari Manju Lata Vs. The State of Bihar & Ors.\n\n (C.W.J.C. No.\n 3361 of 2020) to submit that forfeiture of 100 %\n\n pension of the petitioner in exercise of power under Rule 43(b) of the\n\n Pension Rules at this stage cannot be sustained. It is submitted that the\n\n appointment of the petitioners had taken place more than 30 years ago,\n\n therefore, the Memo under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules would be\n\n invalid.\n\n 59. This Court finds from the materials placed before this\n\n Court that in these cases of Category I, the proceeding under Rule 43(b)\n\n of the Pension Rules was initiated during the service period itself and\n\n those were converted after retirement of the petitioners and further in\n\n their first round of litigation, this Court had though quashed the\n\n impugned order of termination but at the same time granted liberty to\n\n the Regional Deputy Director of the concerned Divisions to proceed\n\n afresh. Sofar as the Category III cases are concerned, in those cases, the\n\n final decision is yet to be taken.\n\n 60. \nIn the totality of the circumstances, since this Court has\n\n found that this is a case akin to and seems to be nearer to the case of\n\n appointments of Class III and Class IV posts in the Tuberculosis\n\n Eradication Scheme by Dr. Mallick and this Court has noticed the\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 68/87\n\n judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of \nDevendra\n\n Sharma\n (supra), this Court finds no reason to interfere with the same.\n\n 61. This Court is therefore, of the considered opinion that the\n\n impugned orders need no interference in exercise of power of this\n\n Court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n Category II Cases\n\n \n62. In the category II cases, there are altogether nine writ\n\n applications. For reference, this Court would take the pleadings from\n\n CWJC No. 354 of 2023 (\nNirmala Vs. State of Bihar and Ors\n).\n\n 63. In this writ application, the petitioner has challenged the\n\n order dated 09.12.2022 passed by State Appellate Authority in O.A. No.\n\n 419 of 2022 and also Memo No. 462 dated 09.10.2020 passed by\n\n Director (Administration) -cum- Additional Chief Secretary, Education\n\n Department, Government of Bihar (Respondent No. 2). The petitioners\n\n have also prayed for grant and payment of retiral benefits along with all\n\n other consequential benefits.\n\n 64. By the impugned order, the service of the petitioners\n\n have been terminated. The order of termination/dismissal from service\n\n was challenged by the petitioner Nirmala Bhartibefore the State\n\n Appellate Authority. The Chairperson (A) and the State Appellate\n\n Authority held that there was a departmental proceeding conducted after\n\n calling for an explanation from the petitioner. The petitioners were\n\n provided with a copy of the inquiry report and an opportunity to show\n\n cause, therefore, the principle of natural justice has been duly followed.\n\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 69/87\n\n The appeal preferred by the petitioner has been disallowed. So far as\n\n other petitioners are concerned, they have also been dismissed from\n\n service on the ground that they were illegally appointed and their\n\n appointments were void ab initio.\n\n 65.

No. 4981\n\n of 2022, the petitioners have also challenged the inquiry report.\n\n The facts of C.W.J.C. No. 693 of 2022 (\nSmt. Tara Singh Vs. The\n\n State of Bihar and Ors\n) are slightly different inasmuch as against\n\n her a proceeding under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules has been\n\n initiated vide Memo No. 1388 dated 24.11.2021 (Annexure '11' to\n\n the writ application). She has been served with a memo of charge\n\n dated 24.11.2021 (Annexure '12'). It is her contention that she has\n\n superannuated from her service on 30.11.2014 itself. It, however,\n\n transpires on perusal of Annexure '11' to the writ application that\n\n the proceedings were initiated against this petitioner earlier and the\n\n same was converted into a proceeding under Rule 43(b) of the\n\n Pension Rules vide Memo No. 1855 dated 24.08.2016 which was\n\n within a period of two years from the date of her attaining the age\n\n of superannuation. By Annexure '11', the Inquiry Officer and\n\n Presenting Officer have been appointed. As regards the petitioner\n\n Smt. Tara Singh, CBI has found in its preliminary report that she\n\n was over-aged and had been appointed on the recommendation of\n\n the politicians without following proper procedure for such\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 83/87\n\n appointments. No advertisement of the post was made by any local\n\n newspaper.\n\n 72. The materials available on the record would show\n\n that this petitioner has been called upon to participate in the\n\n inquiry by Letter No. 513 dated 17.12.2006. In the writ\n\n application, there is no averment that the proceeding against the\n\n petitioner was not converted under Rule 43(b) in the year 2016.\n\n Her alleged illegal appointment took place in the year 1982 but\n\n that illegality allegedly continued till her retirement, therefore, a\n\n challenge to the initiation of the proceeding under Rule 43(b)\n\n would not be tenable.\n\n 73. Be that as it may, this Court is of the considered\n\n opinion that the petitioners in category III should have co-operated\n\n in course of inquiry by submitting their response and participation\n\n before the Inquiry Officer and the disciplinary authority. Instead of\n\n doing that, their effort is to somehow prolong the ongoing inquiry\n\n and culmination of the disciplinary proceeding. In their cases also,\n\n the principle of natural justice is being followed by the State-\n\n respondents.\n\n 74. Thus, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the\n\n impugned office memo, the charge and/or the inquiry report in this\n\n writ application. The petitioners must participate in the inquiry,\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 84/87\n\n submit their second show cause within a period of two weeks from\n\n today whereupon the Inquiry Officer/ disciplinary authority, as the\n\n case may be, shall proceed in the matter and take appropriate\n\n steps/decision. If they have attained the age of superannuation, the\n\n disciplinary authority shall consider converting the proceeding\n\n under Rule 43(b) of the Pension Rules and pass an appropriate\n\n order within three months from the said date.\n\n 75. Before this Court parts with its judgment, the Court\n\n finds it just and proper to record that in all these writ applications,\n\n learned counsel for the petitioners have raised plea of violation of\n\n principles of natural justice. They have gone to the extent of\n\n submitting that the CBI has not examined the appointees, however,\n\n this Court has noticed from the preliminary report of the CBI that\n\n they have examined some of the appointees also. The petitioners\n\n have been given enough opportunity to rebut the specific case of\n\n the respondent-State in term of the Memo of Charge that the\n\n appointments in Category-I and Category-II cases were done\n\n without advertisement and selection procedure. In category-III\n\n cases the State-Respondent have served second show cause on the\n\n petitioners. This Court is of the considered opinion that where the\n\n illegality writs large on the face of the kind of allegations made in\n\n the preliminary inquiry, the principle of natural justice cannot be\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 85/87\n\n stretched to the extent of rejecting the report of the CBI as a waste\n\n paper. It is to be remembered that the matter relating to illegal\n\n appointments of these petitioners were raised as back as in the year\n\n 1998 and the inquiry report of the CBI was submitted in the year\n\n 2004 itself. But it was kept pending for no valid reason and had the\n\n Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court not called upon the Principal\n\n Secretary of the Education Department, Government of Bihar to\n\n explain as to why no action has been taken on the inquiry report of\n\n the CBI, the matter would have remained as it is.\n\n \n76. The huge delay on the part of the State respondents\n\n by sitting over the preliminary inquiry report of the CBI has done\n\n a lot of damage to the interest of the State. The delay alone has\n\n given rise to a spacious plea that at this stage the petitioners have\n\n continued over 30 years, therefore, no action may be taken against\n\n them in accordance with law. Although this Court has negated this\n\n plea but at the same time it is noticed that by virtue of the\n\n appointments which were wholly illegal, public money has been\n\n disbursed to the illegal appointees conferring them the benefits of\n\n pay and perks during all these years. This Court being a\n\n constitutional Court sitting under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of\n\n India deems it just and proper to take judicial notice of the\n\n principles of public accountability. The case of Vineet Narain and\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 86/87\n\nOrs. Vs. the Union of India and Ors.\n reported in (1996) 2 SCC\n\n 199, is a step forward towards accountability in public life. The\n\n preliminary investigation report of the CBI is clearly indicating\n\n towards extraneous consideration which has taken place in the\n\n matter of large scale appointments and promotions in the LSS\n\n (Women wing) in the State of Bihar during the period 1980-1998.\n\n The case was handed over to CBI but why CBI remained\n\n contented by only submitting a preliminary inquiry report is\n\n something which is required to be looked into by the CBI itself at\n\n this stage. This Court is concerned because it is of the opinion that\n\n those who were involved in keeping aside the law and the\n\n procedures for appointment on public post should not be allowed\n\n to go scot-free only because they have succeeded in somehow\n\n stalling the consequential action. In the totality of the\n\n circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion as under:-\n\n (i) The CBI should take the case to a logical end. Its'\n\n preliminary inquiry report is available on the record indicating the\n\n manner in which appointments were done on political\n\n recommendations and by the authorities in the Education Department\n\n who were not competent, without advertisement and without there being\n\n any selection process. The CBI is, therefore, obliged to consider as to\n\n whether or not its' preliminary report should be converted in a regular\n Patna High Court No.20636 of 2021 dt.26-09-2023\n\n 87/87\n\n case and the matter be investigated in accordance with law for its\n\n logical conclusion; and\n\n (ii) The Additional Chief Secretary of the Education\n\n Department, Government of Bihar is also required to look into the\n\n reason(s) for the huge delay in not taking the consequential action\n\n pursuant to the report of the CBI submitted in the year 2004. Those who\n\n are behind this inaction are required to be identified and appropriate\n\n action is to be considered.\n\n 77. Accordingly, this Court having taken judicial notice\n\n of the above mentioned facts emerging from the pleadings on the\n\n record and finding that the CBI is already party respondent in\n\n some of the writ applications, directs the Director, CBI and the\n\n Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Education, Government\n\n of Bihar to consider taking appropriate action within a period of\n\n one month from the date of receipt/communication of this order.\n\n 78. These writ applications are, thus, disposed of in the\n\n aforesaid terms.\n\n (Rajeev Ranjan Prasad, J)\navin/-\n\nAFR/NAFR AFR\nCAV DATE 12.09.2023\nUploading Date 26.09.2023\nTransmission Date",

Where after\n following the above procedure, the Court/Tribunal sets\n aside the order of punishment, the proper relief that should\n be granted is to direct reinstatement of the employee with\n liberty to the authority/management to proceed with the\n inquiry, by placing the employee under suspension and\n continuing the inquiry from the stage of furnishing him\n with the report. The question whether the employee would\n be entitled to the back-wages and other benefits from the\n date of his dismissal to the date of his reinstatement if\n ultimately ordered, should invariably be left to be decided\n by the authority concerned according to law, after the\n culmination of the proceedings and depending on the final\n outcome.

The reinstatement made as a result of the\n setting aside of the inquiry for failure to furnish the report,\n should be treated as a reinstatement for the purpose of\n holding the fresh inquiry from the stage of furnishing the\n report and no more, where such fresh inquiry is held.
