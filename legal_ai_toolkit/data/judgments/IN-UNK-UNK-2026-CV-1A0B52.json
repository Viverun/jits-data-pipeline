Rule 13A which was introduced sometime later, gave\ntemporaury exemption from passing the departmental tests for\na period of two years. The rule also provided that an\nemployee who did not pass the unified departmental tests\nwithin the period of two years from the date of introduction\nof the test would be reverted to the lower post and further\nsaid that he shall not again be eligible for appointment\nunder this rule. Proviso 2 to this rule gave temporary\nexemption of two years in the case of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes candidates. A Harijan Welfare Association\nrepresented to the State Government that a large number of\nHarijan employees in the State service were facing immediate\nreversion as a result of this rule and requuested the\nGovernment to grant exemption in respect of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes employees from passing the obligatory\ndepartmental tests for a period of two years with immediate\neffect. Accordingly, the State Government introduced rule\n13AA giving further exemption of two years to members\nbelonging to Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes in the\nservice from passing the tests referred to in r. 13 or r.\n13A\n Respondent no. 1 passed the special tests in November,\n1971. The other respondents belonging to Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes were promoted as Upper Division Clerks\neven though they had not passed the prescribed tests\nRespondent no. 1 who was not promoted in spite of the fact\nthat he had passed the urequisite tests moved the High Court\nunder \nArt. 226\n of the Constitution seeking a declaration\nthat r. 13AA under which exemption had been granted to the\nother respondents in the matter of promotion was violative\nof \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution. The High Court struck down\nthe imugned rule as violative of \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n and \nArt.\n335\n of the Constitution.\n Allowing the State's appeal to this Court,\n [Per majority, Ray C.J., Mathew, Beg Krishna Iyer, S.\nM. Fazal Ali, JJ.; Khanna and Gupta. JJ. dissenting]\n^\n HELD: (Per Ray C.J.) The classification of employees\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for\nallowing them an extended period of two years for passing\nthe special tests for promotion is a just and reasonable\nclassification haring rational nexus to the object of\nproviding equal opportunity for all citizens in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment to public offices.\n[930H]\n907\n (1) \nArticles 14\n, 15\n and \n16\n form part of a string of\nconstitutionally guaranteed rights. These rights supplement\neach other. \nArticle 16\n is an incident of guarantee of\nequality contained in \nArt. 14.\n Both \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n\npermit reasonable classification having a nexus to the\nobjects to be achieved. Under \nArt. 16\n there can be a\nreasonable classification of the employees in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment. [926F]\n State of Gujarat and Anr. etc. v. Shri Ambica Mills\nLtd. Ahmedabad etc. A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1300, referred to.\n (2) Equality is violated if it rests on an unreasonable\nbasis. The concept of equality has an inherent limitation\narising from the very nature of the constitutional\nguarantee. Those who are similarly circumstanced are\nentitled to equal treatment. Classification is to be founded\non substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped\ntogether from those left out of the groups and such\ndifferential attributes must bear a just and rational\nrelation to the object sought to be achieved. [927 C]\n (3) If there is a rational classification consistent\nwith the purpose for which such classification is made\nequality is not violated. The categories of classification\nfor purposes of promotion can never be closed on the\ncontention that they are all members of the same cadre in\nservice. If classification is made on educational\nqualifications for purposes of promotion or if\nclassification is made on the ground that the persons are\nnot similarly circumstanced in regard to their entry into\nemployment such classification can be justified. [927E-F]\n C. V. Rajendran v. Union of India [1968] 1 S.C.R. 721,\nfollowed.\n (4) Art 1.(1) does not bar a reasonable classification\nof employees or reasonable tests for their selection. There\nis no denial of equality of opportunity unless the person\nwho complains of discrimination is equally situated with\nthe. person or persons who are alleged to have been\nfavoured. [928 F]\n State of Mysore v. V. P. Narasinga Rao [1968] 1 S.C.R.\n407, referred to.\n (5) Under \nArt. 16(1)\n equality of opportunity of\nemployment means equality as between members of the same\nclass of employees and not equality between. members of\nseparate, independent class. The present case does not\ncreate separate avenues of promotion for these persons. [928\nF]\n All India Station Masters and Assistant Station\nMasters' Association v. General Manager, Central Railways\n[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311, referred to.\n (6) The Legislature understands and appreciates the\nneeds of its own people that its laws are directed to\nproblems made manifest by experience and that its\ndiscriminations are based upon adequate grounds. The rule of\nclassification is not a natural and logical corollary of the\nrule of equality, but the rule of differentiation is\ninherent in the concept of equality. Equality means parity\nof treatment under parity of conditions. Equality does not\nconnote absolute equality. A classification, in order to be\nconstitutional, must rest upon distinctions that are\nsubstantial and not merely illusory. The test is whether it\nhas a reasonable basis free from artificiality and\narbitrariness embracing all and omitting none naturally\nfalling into that category. [929 D]\n Govind Dattatray Kelkar v. Chief Controller of Imports,\n[1967] 2 S.C.R. 29; Ganga Ram v. Union of India [1970] 1\nS.C.C. 377 and Roshan Lal Tandon v Union of India [1968] I\nS.C.R. 185, referred to.\n (7) The relevant touchstone of validity is to find out\nwhether the rule of preference secures adequate\nrepresentation for the unrepresented backward community or\ngoes beyond it. [930 G]\n (8) The historical background of the rules justifies\nthe classification of the personnel of the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes for the purpose of granting them\nexemption from special tests with a view to ensuring them\nthe\n908\nequality of treatment and equal opportunity in matters of\nemployment having regard to their backwardness and under-\nrepresentation in the employment of he State. [931 C]\n (9) (a) The Constitution makes a classification of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in numerous provisions\nnamely Arts. 46, 335, 338 and 341 and gives a mandate to the\nState to accord special or favoured treatment to them. [931\nD]\n (b) The impugned rule and the orders are related to\nthis constitutional mandate. Without providing for\nrelaxation of special tests for a temporary period it would\nnot have been possible to give adequate promotion to the\nLower Division Clerks belonging to the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes to the posts of Upper Division Clerks. The\ntemporary relaxation of test qualification made in favour of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is warranted by\ntheir inadequate representation in the services and their\noverall backwardness. The classification of the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes made under r. 13AA\nis within the purview of constitutional mandate under \nArt.\n335\n in consideration of their claims to redress imbalance in\npublic service and to bring, about parity in the communities\nin the. public services. [931H; 932A-B]\n (10) Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not a\ncaste within the ordinary meaning of castes. [932 E]\n Bhaiyalal v. Harikishan Singh and Ors. [1965] 2 S.C.R.\n877, referred to\n (11)(a) our Constitution aims at equality of status and\nopportunity for all citizens including those who are\nsocially, economically and educationally backward. The\nclaims of members of backward classes require adequate\nrepresentation in legislative and executive bodies. If\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are\nsaid by this Court to be backward classes, can maintain\nminimum necessary requirement of administrative efficiency,\nnot only representation but also preference may be given to\nthem to enforce equality and to eliminate inequality. [932G-\nH]\n (b) Equality of opportunity for unequals can only mean\naggravation of inequality. Equality of opportunity admits\ndiscrimination with reason and prohibits discrimination\nwithout reason. Preferential representation for the backward\nclasses in services with due regard to administrative\nefficiency is a permissible object and backward classes are\na rational classification recognised by the Constitution.\nTherefore, differential treatment in standards of selection\nis within the concept of equality. [933B-C]\n (c) The rule in the present case does not impair the\ntest of efficiency in administration inasmuch a., members of\nScheduled Castes and Tribes who are promoted have to acquire\nthe qualification of passing the test. The only relaxation\nwhich is done in their case is that they are granted two\nyears more time than others to acquire the qualification.\n[933 D]\n (12) (a) Equal protection of laws necessarily involves\nclassification. The validity of the classification must be\nadjusted with reference to the purpose of the law. [933 G]\n (b) The classification in the present case is justified\nbecause the purpose of classification is to enable members\nof Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to find\nrepresentation by promotion to a limited extent From the\npoint of view of time a differential treatment is given to\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Tribes for the purpose of\ngiving them equality consistent with efficiency. [933 H]\n (13) The High Court was wrong in basing its conclusion\nthat the result of application of the impeached rule and the\norders is excessive and exorbitant. The promotions made in\nservices as a whole are nowhere near 50% of the total number\nof posts. It is correct that r. 13AA and the orders are\nmeant to implement not only the direction under \nArt. 335\n but\nalso the directive principle under \nArt. 46.\n [932C-D]\n909\n Per Mathew, J.\n (1) The concept of equality of opportunity is an aspect\nof the more comprehensive notion of equality. The idea of\nequality has different shades of meaning and connotations.\nIt has many facets and implications. [948 A]\n (2) The notion of equality of opportunity has meaning\nonly when a limited number of posts as in the present case\nshould be allocated on grounds which do not a priori exclude\nany section of citizens of those that desire it. A priori\nexclusion means exclusion on grounds other than those\nappropriate or rational for the good in question. The notion\nrequires not merely that there should be no exclusion from\naccess on grounds other than those appropriate or rational\nfor the good in question but the grounds considered\nappropriate for the good should themselves be such that\npeople from all sections of society have an equal chance of\nsatisfying them. [950A-B]\n (3) To give equality of opportunity for employment to\nthe members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it is\nnecessary to take note of their social, educational and\neconomic environment. Not only is the Directive Principle\nembodied in \nArt. 46\n binding on the law-maker as ordinarily\nunderstood but it should equally inform and illuminate the\napproach of the Court when it makes a decision as the Court\nalso is `State' within the meaning of \nArt. 12\n and makes law\neven though interstitially. [951 E]\n His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalayaru v.\nState of Kerala and Another, etc. [1973] Supp. S.C.R. 1,\nreferred to.\n (4) Equality of opportunity is not simply a matter of\nlegal equality. Its existence depends not merely on the\nabsence of disabilities but on the presence of abilities.\n[951 F]\n (5) The guarantee of equality before the law or the\nequal opportunity in matters of employment is a guarantee of\nsomething more than what is required by formal equality. It\nimplies differential treatment of persons who are unequal.\nEgalitarian principle has, therefore. enhanced the growing\nbelief that Government has an affirmative duty to eliminate\ninequalities and to provide opportunities for the exercise\nof human rights and claims. [951 H]\n (6) Fundamental Rights as enacted in Part III of the\nConstitution are, by and large, essentially negative in\ncharacter. They mark off a world it which time Government\nshould have no jurisdiction. In this realm, it was assumed\nthat a citizen has no claim upon Government except to be let\nalone.[952 A]\n (7)(a) But the language of \nArt. 16(1)\n is in marked\ncontrast with that of \nArt. 14.\n Whereas the accent in Art 14\nis on the injunction that the State shall not deny to any\nperson equality before the law or the equal protection of\nthe laws, that is, on the negative character of the duty of\nthe State, the emphasis in \nArt. 16(1)\n is on the mandatory\naspect. [952 B]\n (b) If equality of opportunity guaranteed under \nArt.\n16(1)\n means effective material equality, then \nArt. 16(4)\n is\nnot an exception to \nArt. 16(1).\n It is only all emphatic way\nof putting the extent in which equality of opportunity could\nbe carried namely even upto the point of making reservation.\n[956]\n (c) \nArt. 16(1)\n is only a part of a comprehensive scheme\nto ensure equality in all spheres. It is an instance of the\napplication of the larger. concept of equaliy under the law\nembodied in Arts. 14 and 15. \nArticle 16(1)\n permits of\nclassification just as \nArt. 14\n does. But, by the\nclassification, there can be no discrimination on the ground\nonly of race, caste and other factor mentioned in \nArt.\n16(2).\n [951 F]\n S.C. Jaisighani v. Union of India & Ors. [1967] 2\nS.C.R. 703 at 712: State of Mysore & Anr. v. P. Narasing Rao\n[1968] 1 S.C.R. 407 at 410 & C. A. Rajendran v. Union of\nIndia & Ors. [1968] 1 S.C.R. 721, at 729 referred to.\n910\n (d) The word `caste' in \nArt. 16(2)\n does not include\nScheduled Castes. The definition of Scheduled Castes' in\n\nArt. 366(24)\n shows that it is by virtue of the notification\nof the President that the Scheduled Castes come into being.\nThough the members of the Scheduled Castes are drawn from\ncastes, races or tribes, they attain a new status by virtue\nof the Presidential notification. Moreover, though the\nmembers of tribe might be included in Scheduled Castes,\ntribe as such is not mentioned in \nArticle 16(2).\n [957 A]\n (e) \nArticle 16(1)\n and Art 16(2) do not prohibit the\nprescription of a reasonable qualification for appointment\nor for promotion. Any provision as to qualification for\nemployment or appointment to are office reasonably fixed and\napplicable to all would be consistent with the doctrine of\nequality of opportunity under \nArt. 16(1).\n [957 E]\n The General Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n[1962] 3.S.C.R. 586 referred to\n (8) Today, the sense that Government has affirmative\nresponsibility for elimination of inequalities, social,\neconomic or otherwise, is one of the dominant forces in\nconstitutional law. [952 E]\n (9) The concept of equality of opportunity in matters\nof employment is wide enough to include within it\ncompensatory measures to put the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes on par with the members of other\ncommunities which would enable them to get their share of\nrepresentation in public service. [954 E]\n (10) If reservation is necessary either at the initial\nstage or at the stage of promotion or at both to ensure for\nthe members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nequality of opportunity in the matter of employment. there\nis no reason why that is not permissible under \nArt. 16(1)\n as\nthat alone might put them on a parity with the forward\ncommunities in the matter of achieving the result which\nequality of opportunity would produce. Equality of result is\nthe test of equality of opportunity. [954 G-H]\n (11) The State can adopt any measure which would ensure\nthe adequate representation in public service of the members\nof the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and justify it\nas a compensatory measure to ensure equality of opportunity\nprovided the measure does not dispense with the acquisition\nof the minimum basic qualification necessary for the\nefficiency of administration.[956 D]\n (12) It is a mistake to assume a priori that there can\nbe no classification within a class, say, the Lower Division\nClerks. If there are intelligible differentia which separate\na group within that class from the rest and that differentia\nhave nexus with the object of classification, there is no\nobjection to a further classification within the class. [957\nC]\n All India Station Masters and Assistant Station Masters\nAssociation v. General Manager Central Railway and others\n[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311, S. C. Jaisingjamoi v. Union of India\nand others [1967] 2 S.C.R. 703 at 712 & State of Jammu &\nKashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa & others [1974] 1 S.C.R. 771\nheld inapplicable.\n (13) In the instant case Rule 13AA has been enacted not\nwith the idea of dispensing with the minimum qualification\nrequired for promotion to a higher category or class, but\nonly to give enough breathing space to enable the members of\nSeheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to acquire it. The\npurpose of the classification made in r. 13AA is to enable\nthem to have their due claim of representation in the higher\ncategory without sacrificing the efficiency implicit in the\npassing of the test. [958 B]\n (14) The classification made in r. 13AA has a\nreasonable nexus with the purpose of the law. Rule 13AA is\nnot intended to give permanent exemption to the members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from passing the test\nbut only reasonable time to enable to them to do so. That\nthe power is liable to be abused is no reason to hold that\nthe rule itself is bad. [958 E]\n911\nPer Beg J.\n The only ground given by the High Court for refusing to\ngive the benefits of the impugned rules and orders to the\nbackward class Government servants, that they fall outside\nthe purview of \nArt. 16(4)\n was not substantiated. The\nrespondent has not discharged the burden establishing a\nconstitutionally unwarranted discrimination against him.\n[963 H]\n (1) When citizens are already employed in a particular\n grade as government servant considerations relating to the\n sources from which they were drawn lose much of their\n importance. Neither as members of a single class nor for\n purposes of equality of opportunity which is to be afforded\n to this class does the fact that some of them also members\n of economically and socially backward class continue to be\nmaterial or, even relevant. Their entry into the me relevant\n class as others must be deemed to indicate that they no\n longer suffer from the handicaps of a backward class. For\n purposes of Government service the source from which they\n are drawn should cease to matter. As Government servants.\nthey would form only one class for the purpose of promotion.\n [960A-B]\n (2) (a) The specified and express mode of realisation\nof the objects contained in \nArt. 16(4)\n, must exclude the\npossibility of the methods which could be implied and read\ninto \nArt. 16(1)\n for securing them in this field the\napplicable maxim being `expressio unius est exclusio\nalterius\". [960 H]\n (2) (b) The purpose of equality of opportunity by means\nof tests is only to ensure a fair competition in securing\nposts and promotions in Government service, and not the\nremoval of causes for unequal performances in competitions\nfor these posts or promotions. [960 H]\n (3) \nArticle 16(4)\n is designed to reconcile the\nconflicting pulls of \nArt. 16 (1)\n representing the dynamics\nof justice conceived of as equality in conditions under\nwhich candidates actually compete for posts in Government\nservice and of Arts. 46 and 355 embodying the duties of the\nState to promote the interests of the economically\neducationally and socially backward so as to release them\nfrom the clutches of social injustice. These encroachments\non the field of \nArt. 16(1)\n can only be permitted to the\nextent they are warraned by \nArt. 16(4).\n To read broader\nconcepts of social justice and equality into \nArt. 16(1)\n may\nstultify this provision and make \nArt. 16(4)\n otiose. [961C-D]\n (4) It would be dangerous to extend the limits of\nprotection against the operation of the principle of\nequality of opportunity in this field beyond its express\nconstitutional authorisation by \nArt. 16(4).\n [959 G]\n (5) But if the impugned rules and orders could be\nviewed as an implementation of a policy of qualified or\npartial or conditional reservation which could satisfy the\nrequirements of substantial equality in keeping with \nArt.\n335\n and meet the demands of equality and justice looked from\nthe point of view of \nArt. 46\n of the Constitution, they could\nalso be justified under \nArt. 16(4)\n of the Constitution. [963\nB-C]\n (6) Though the respondent was not promoted in spite of\npassing the efficiency test earlier the backward class\nemployees who were given preference over him, were\ndischarging their duties in the higher grade quite\nsatisfactorily and were his seniors in service. Taking and\npassing of a written test earlier than another employee\ncould not be the sole factor to consider in deciding upon a\nclaim to superiority or to preference on grounds of merit\nand efficiency for promotion as a government servant. [962A-\nB]\n (7) The effect of the relaxation is that a backward\nclass employee continues in the post temporarily for a\nlonger period before being either confirmed or reverted. For\nthis period, the post remains reserved for him. If he does\nnot satisfy the efficiency tests even within the extended\nperiod he has to revert to the lower grade. If he does\nsatisfy the special efficiency tests. in this extended\nperiod. he is confirmed in the class of promotees into which\nhe obtained entry because of a reservation. One of the\ndictionary meanings of the word\n912\n`reserve' is \"to keep back or hold over to a later time or\nplace for further treatment etc.\" The result of the rule\ntherefore is a kind of reservation.\n (8) If reservation of posts under Art 16(4) for\nemployees of backward classes could include complete\nreservation of higher posts to which they could he promoted,\nthere is no reason why it could not be partial or for a part\nof the duration of service and hedged round with the\ncondition that a temporary. promotion would operate as a\ncomplete and confirmed promotion only if the temporary\npromotee satisfies some tests within a given time. [963 A]\n In the instant cases apart from the fact that it is\nonly one of partial or temporary and conditional\nreservation, it is disputed here that the favoured class of\nemployees constituted more than 50% of the total number of\nGovernments servants of this class (Clerks) if the overall\nposition is taken into account. Furthermore, a large number\nof temporary promotions of backward class Government\nservants of this grade had taken place in 1972 in the\nDepartment because promotions of this class of employees had\nbeen held up in the past due to want of necessary provision\nin the rules. The totality of facts of this case to want of\nnecessary provision in the rules. The totality of facts of\nthis case is distinguishable in their effects from those in\nT. Devadasan v. Union of India [1964] 4 S.C.R. 680 and M.R.\nBalaji & Ors. v. State of Mysore [1963] Suppl. 1 S.C.R. 439.\n[963 D-F]\n Per Krishna Iyer. J.\n (1) The Indian Constitution is a great social document,\nalmost revolutionary in its aim of transforming a medieval,\nhierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy.\nIts provisions can be comprehended only by a specious,\nsocial-science approach, not by pedantic, traditional\nlegalism. [964 E]\n (2) (a) The Preamble to the Constitution silhouettes a\n'justice-oriented' community. The Directive Principles of\nState Policy, enjoin on the State the promotion with special\ncare the educational and economic interests of the weaker\nsections of the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes and protect them from social\ninjustice. To neglect this obligation is to play truant with\n\nArt. 46.\n Economic interests of a group-as also social\njustice to it-are tied up with its place in the services\nunder the State. [974 A-B]\n (b) The unanimous opinion of this Court in Keshavananda\nBharti's case is that the Court must wisely read the\ncollective Directive Principles of Part IV into the\nindividual fundamental rights of Part III, neither part\nbeing superior to the other. In this case, the supplementary\ntheory, treating both Parts as fundamental, gained\nsupremacy. [977 A]\n (c) The upshot is that \nArt. 46\n has to be given emphatic\nexpression while interpreting \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n Indeed\n\nArt. 335\n is more specific and cannot be brushed aside or\ntruncated in the operational ambit vis a vis Arts. 16 (1)\nand (2) without hubristic aberration. [977 F-G]\n (3) The conclusions that could be drawn from the\nprovisions of the Constitution are: (1) The Constitution\nitself demarcates harijans from others. (2) This is based on\nthe stark backwardness of this bottom layer of the\ncommunity. (3) The differentiation has been made to cover\nspecifically the area of appointments to posts under the\nState. (4) The twin objects blended into one, are claims of\nharijans to be considered in such posts and the maintenance\nof administrative efficiency. (5) The State has been\nobligated to promote the economic interests of harijans and\nlike backward classes, Arts. 46 and 335 being a testament\nand Arts. 14 to 16 being the tool-kit. To blink at this\npanchsheel is to be unjust to the Constitution. [975 B-C]\n (4) To relax on basic qualifications is to compromise\nwith minimum administrative efficiency; to relent, for a\ntime, on additional test qualifications as to take a\ncalculated but controlled risk, assured of a basic standard\nof performance; to encourage the possession of higher\nexcellence is to upgrade the\n913\nefficiency status of the public servant and eventually, of\nthe department. This is the sense and essence of the\nsituation arising in the present case, viewed from the angle\nof administrative requirements or fair employment criteria.\n [967 C-D]\n (5) Efficiency means, in terms of good government, not\nmarks in examinations only, but responsible and responsive\nservice to the people. [976 C]\n (6)(a) A bare reading of Arts. 341 and 342 brings out\nthe quintessential concept that the Scheduled Castes and\nTribes are no castes in the Hindu fold but an amalgam of\ncastes, races, groups, tribes, communities or parts thereof\nfound on investigation to be the lowliest and in need of\nmassive State aid and notified as such by the President.\n[977 H]\n (b) The discerning sense of the Indian Corpus Juris has\ngenerally regarded Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,\nnot as a caste but as a large backward group deserving of\nsocietal compassion. [978 B]\n (7) (a) Given two alternative understandings of the\nrelevants sub-Articles [Arts. 16(1) and (2)] the Court must\nso interpret the language as to remove that ugly\n'inferiority' complex which has done genetic damage to\nIndian polity and thereby suppress the malady and advance\nthe remedy, informed by sociology and social anthropology.\nThe touch-stone is that functional democracy postulates\nparticipation by all sections of the people and fair\nrepresentation in administration is an index of such\nparticipation. [971 E-F]\n (b) Clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n if closely examined, is an\nillustration of constitutionally sanctified classification.\n\nArt. 16(4)\n need not be a saving clause but put in due to the\nover anxiety of the draftsman to make matters clear beyond\npossibility of doubt. [978 H]\n (c) Reservation confers pro tanto monopoly, but\nclassification grants under \nArt. 16(1)\n ordinarily a lesser\norder of advantage. The former is more rigid, the latter\nmore flexible, although they may overlap sometimes. \nArt.\n16(4)\n covers all backward classes; but to earn the benefit\nof grouping under \nArt. 16(1)\n based on \nArt. 46\n and \n335\n, the\ntwin considerations of terrible backwardness of the type\nharijans endure and maintenance of adminsistrative\nefficiency must be satisfied. [979 C-D]\n (d) The fact that better educational prescription for\npromotion posts have been upheld by this Court does not rule\nout other resonable differentia having a nexus with the\nobject. The true test is what is the object of the\nclassification and is it permissible? Further, is the\ndifferentia sound and substantial and clearly related to the\napproved object? [980 H]\n (e) The genius of Arts. 14 to 16 consists not in\nliteral equality but in progressive elimination of\npronounced inequality. To treat sharply dissimilar persons\nequally is subtle injustice. Equal opportunity is a hope,\nnot a menace. [981 B]\n In the present case the economic advancement and\npromotion of the claims of the grossly under-represented and\npathetically neglected classes, otherwise described as\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, consistently with the\nmaintenance of administrative efficiency is the object,\nconstitutionally sanctioned by \nArt. 46\n and \n335\n, and\nreasonably accommodated in \nArt. 16(1).\n The differentia so\nloudly obtrusive, is the dismal social milieu of harijans.\nThis has a rational relation to the object set out above.\n[981 C]\n (8) It is a statistically proved social reality in\nIndia that the depressed employment position of harijan is\nthe master problem in the battle against generations of\nretardations and reservation and other solutions have made\nno significant impact on their employment in public service.\nIn such an unjust situation, to maintain mechanical equality\nis to prepetuate actual inequality. Relaxation of 'tests'\nqualification at the floor level of clerical posts is a part\nof this multiform strategy to establish broader though\nseemingly differential equality. [983 F]\n914\nPer Fazal Ali, J.\n Rule 13AA is a valid piece of statutory provision which\nis fully justified under \nArt. 16(1)\n of the Constitution and\ndoes not fall within the purview of \nArt. 16(4).\n [1007 F]\n (1)(a) Equality of opportunity would mean a fair\nopportunity not only to one section or the other but to all\nsections for removing the handicaps if a particular section\nof the society suffers from the same. What \nArt. 14\n or \nArt.\n16\n forbids is hostile discrimination and not reasonable\nclassification. In other words the idea of classification is\nimplicit in the concept of equality because equality means\nequality to all and not merely to the advanced and educated\nsections of the society. [992 H; 993 B]\n (b) It follows that in order to provide the equality of\nopportunity to all citizens, every class of citizens must\nhave a sense of equal participation in building up an\negalitarian society. [993 C]\n (c) The only manner in which the objective of equality\nas enshrined in \nArt. 14\n and \n16\n can be achieved is to boost\nup the backward classes by giving them concessions,\nrelaxations, facilities, removing handicaps and making\nsuitable reservations so that the weaker sections may\ncompete with the more advanced and in due course become\nequals and backwardness is banished for ever. [993 D]\n (2)(a) There is complete unanimity of judicial opinion\nof this Court that the Directive Principles and the\nFundamental Rights should be construed in harmony with each\nother and every attempt should be made by the Court to\nresolve apparent inconsistency. [993 H]\n (b) The Directive Principles contained in Part IV\nconstitute the stairs to climb the high edifice of a\nsocialistic State and the Fundamental Rights are the means\nthrough which one can reach the top of the edifice.

The Directives, thus provide the policy, the\nguidelines and the end of socio-economic freedom and Arts.\n14 and 16 are the means to implement the policy to achieve\nthe ends sought to be promoted by the Directive Principles.\nSo far as the Court are concerned where there is no apparent\ninconsistency between the Directive Principles contained in\nPart IV and the Fundamental Rights mentioned in Part III,\nthere is no difficulty in putting a harmonious construction\nwhich advances the object of the Constitution. [996 E-F]\n (3)(a) The word 'caste' appearing after 'Scheduled' is\nreally a misnomer and has been used only for the purpose of\nidentifying this particular class of citizens which has a\nspecial history of several hundred years behind it. The\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have been a special\nclass of citizens who have been so included and described\nthat they have come to be identified as the most backward\nclasses of citizens of this country. [997 A-B]\n (b) Properly analysed, \nArt. 46\n contains a mandate to\nthe State to take special care for the educational and\neconomic interests of the weaker sections of the people and\nas illustrations of the persons who constitute the weaker\nsections the provision expressly mentions the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes. [997 F]\n (c) A combined reading of \nArt. 46\n and clauses 24 and 25\nof \nArt. 366\n clearly shows that the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled\n915\nTribes must be presumed to be backward classes of citizens\nparticularly when the Constitution gives the example of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as being the\nweaker sections of the society. [997 G]\n (d) The members of the Scheduled Castes and the Tribes\nhave been given a special status in the Constitution and\nthey constitute a class by themselves. That being the\nposition it follows that they do not fall within the purview\nof \nArt. 16(2)\n of the Constitution which prohibits\ndiscrimination between the members of the same caste. If the\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are\nnot castes then it is open to the State to make reasonable\nclassification in order to advance or lift these classes so\nthat they may be able to be properly represented in the\nservices under the State. [998 A-B]\n (4)(a) \nArt. 16\n is merely an incident of \nArt. 14\n and\nboth these articles form a part of the common system seeking\nto achieve the same end. [998 D]\n State of Jammu & Kashmir v.

Union\nof India and others, [1975] 3 S.C.C. 76, 102, referred to.\n (d) Equality of opportunity for all citizens envisaged\nin \nArt. 16(1)\n implies that opportunity must be given not\nonly to a particular section of the society or a particular\nclass of citizens who may be advanced or otherwise more\naffluent but to all classes of citizens. This can be\nachieved by making a reasonable classification so that every\nclass of citizens is duly represented in the service which\nwill enable equality of opportunity to all citizens. The\nclassification must, however, be reasonable and must fulfil\nthe following conditions. [1000 G]\n (i) It must have a rational basis; (ii) It must have a\nclose nexus with the object sought to be achieved and (iii)\nIt should not select any person for hostile discrimination\nat the cost of others. [1000 H]\n (5) (a) If the promotees do not belong to a caste as\ncontemplated by \nArt. 16(2)\n then they do not fall within the\nmischief of \nArt. 16(2)\n at all. Thus the case of the\npromotees squarely falls within the four-corners of \nArt.\n16(1)\n and can be justified as based on reasonable\nclassification. [1002 B]\n (b) Clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution cannot be\nread in isolation but has to be read as part and parcel of\n\nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n [1002 E]\n (c) Clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n is not an exception of \nArt.\n14\n in the sense that whatever classification can be made can\nbe done only through clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n Clause (4) of\n\nArt. 16\n, however, is an explanation containing an exhaustive\nand exclusive provision regarding reservation which is one\nof the forms of classification. Thus clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n\ndeals exclusively with reservation and not other forms of\nclassification which can be made under \nArt. 16(1)\n itself.\nSince clause (4) is a special provision regarding\nreservation, it can safely be held that it overrides \nArt.\n16(1)\n to that extent and no reservation can be made under\n\nArt. 16(1).\n [1002 G-H]\n916\n (d) \nArt. 16(4)\n is not a proviso to \nArt. 16(1)\n but this\nclause covers the whole field of \nArt. 16.\n Dissenting view of\nSubba Rao, J. in T. Devandasan v. Union of India. [1964] 4\nS.C.R. 680, applied.\n (e) Clause 4 of \nArt. 16\n contains express provisions\nempowering the State to make reservations in suitable cases\nprovided the following conditions are satisfied:\n (i) That the class for which reservation is made must\nbe socially and educationally backward.\n (ii) That the class for which reservation is made is\nnot adequately represented in the services under the State.\n[1004 E]\n (iii) The reservation should not be too excessive so as\nto destroy the very concept of equality, and [1005 A]\n (iv) Reservation should not be made at the cost of\nefficiency. [1006 C]\n (6) In the instant case what Rule 13AA does is merely\nto authorise the Government to exempt for a specified period\nany member or members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled\nTribes from passing the test referred to in Rule 13 and Rule\n13A. The rule does not give complete licence. A Lower\nDivision Clerk who is a member of the Scheduled Caste or the\nScheduled Tribe could not be promoted without passing any\ntest at all so as to destroy the concept of equality. It\nmerely gives a special concession or a temporary relaxation\nto cockward class of citizens in order to lift them, advance\nthem and enable them to compete with the stronger sections\nof the society. Thus, the basis of the rule is undoubtedly\nboth rational and reasonable. The rule does not grant\ncomplete exemption to the promotees from passing the test.\nIt only provides for grant of extension of time to enable\nthem to clear the test. It cannot, therefore be held that\nthe State's action in incorporating rule 13AA. in any way\nviolates the mandate contained in \nArt. 335.\n The concession\ngiven in Rule 13AA amounts to a reasonable classification\nwhich can be made under \nArt. 16(1)\n and does not amount to\nthe selection of the respondent no. 1 for hostile\ndiscrimination so as to be violative of \nArt. 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution. Respondent no. 1 passed the test necessary for\npromotion to the Upper Grade on November 2. 1971. He cannot\nput forward his claim for being promoted earlier than that\ndate. Extensions granted by the Government to the clerks\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes from 1958 to\n1972 and thereafter upto 1974 will affect respondent no. 1\nonly after November 2, 1971 and not before that date. [1001\nC; F-G; 990 DE]\n (7) If the carry forward rule is not upheld then\nbackwardness will be perpetrated and it would result\nultimately in a vacuum. The High Court was in error in\nholding that the State's action in filling 34 vacancies out\nof 51 by members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes was\nillegal and could not be justified. [1006 C]\n (8) A concession or relaxation in favour of a backward\nclass of citizens particularly when they are senior in\nexperience would not amount to any impairment of efficiency.\nThe High Court was in error in holding that Rule 13AA was\nultra vires and was violative of \nArt. 16\n as it thought that\nthis rule came within the mischief of clause 4 of Art, 16.\n[1006 D-E]\n Per Khanna, J. (dissenting)\n There is no infirmity in the finding of the High Court\nthat the impugned promotions were violative of \nArticle 335\n\nof the Constitution. The Departmental tests are prescribed\nto ensure standards of efficiency for the employees. To\npromote 34 out of 51 persons although they have not passed\nthe Departmental tests and at the same time not to promote\nthose who have passed the Departmental tests can hardly be\nconducive to efficiency. [945 H]\n (1) It is not permissible to waive the requirement of\nthe minimum educational qualification and other standards\nessential for the maintenance of efficiency of service. The\nreservation of seats for the members of the\n917\nbackward class was not to be at the cost of efficiency. This\nfact was brought out in \nArt. 335\n according to which the\nclaims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with\nthe maintenance of officiency of administration in the\nmaking of appointment to services and posts in connection\nwith the affairs of the Union or of a State. [939 B; 938 H]\n (2) The reservation of posts for a section of\npopulation has the effect of conferring a special benefit on\nthat section of the population. Such preferential treatment\nis plainly a negation of the equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to\nan office under the State. Clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n has been\nconstrued as a proviso or exception to cl. (1) of that\nArticle. [939 C]\n The General Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari,\n[1962] 2 S.C.R. 586 and T. Devadasan v. The Union of Indian\nJUDGMENT:\n\n \n(3) The provision of preferential treatment for members\nof backward classes including Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes is that contained in cl. (4) of \nArt. 16.\n There is no\nscope for spelling out such preferential treatment from the\nlanguage of cl. (1) of \nArt. 16\n because the language of that\nclause does not warrant any preference to any citizen\nagainst another citizen. The language of \nArt. 16(4)\n\nindicates that but for this clause it would not have been\npermissible to make any reservation of appointments or posts\nin favour of any backward class of citizens. [939 H; 940 \nA]\n All India Station Masters' & Asstt. Station Masters\nAssn. & Ors. v. General Manager, Central Railway & Ors.\n,\n[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311; \nS. G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India &\nOrs.\n, [1967] 2 S.C.R. 703; and \nState of Jammu & Kashmir v.\nTriloki Nath Khosa & Ors.\n, [1974] 1 S.C.R. 771,\ndistinguished.\n\n \n(4) Equality of opportunity in matters of employment\ncould be predicated only between persons who were either\nseeking the same employment or had obtained the same\nemployment. Equality of opportunity in matters of promotion\nmust mean equality between members of the same class of\nemployees and not equality between members of separate,\nindependent classes. [940 \nE]\n All India Station Masters' & Asstt. Station Masters'\nAssn. & Ors. v. General Manager\n.\n Central Railway & Ors.,\n[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311; referred to.\n\n \n(5) The concept of equality in the matter of promotion\ncan be predicated only when the promotees are drawn from the\nsame source. If the preferential treatment of one source in\nrelation to the other is based on the differences between\nthe two sources. and the said differences have a reasonable\nrelation to the nature of the office, it can legitimately be\nsustained on the basis of a valid classification. The reason\nfor the classification \nin that case\n was that the higher\nechelons of the service should be filled by experienced\nofficers possessing not only a high degree of ability but\nalso first rate experience.\n [1940 H]\n S. G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India & Ors., [1967] 2\nS.C.R. 703, referred to.\n\n (6) A classification based upon the consideration that\nan employee belongs to a particular section of the\npopulation with a view to accord preferential treatment for\npromotion is clear violation of equality of opportunity\nenshrined in cl. (1) of \nArt. 16.\n [941 G]\n (7) The essential object of various rules dealing with\nappointment to posts under the State and promotion to higher\nposts is to ensure efficiency of service. Exemption granted\nto a class of employees even though for a limited period,\nfrom passing the departmental tests which have been\nprescribed for the purpose of promotion would obviously be\nsubversive of the object of ensure efficiency of service. It\ncannot be disputed that departmental tests are prescribed\nwith a view to appraise and ensure efficiency of different\nemployees. To promote employees even though they have not\npassed such efficiency test can hardly be consistent with\nthe desideratum of ensuring efficiency in administration.\n[942 B]\n\n918\n\n (8) The fact that exemption from passing departmental\ntests granted to members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes is not absolute but only for a limited period would\nnot lend constitutionality to the impugned rule and orders.\nExemption granted to a section of employees while being\nwithheld from the remaining employees has obvious element of\ndiscrimination between those to whom it is granted and those\nfrom whom it is withheld. If the passing of departmental\ntests is an essential condition of promotion it would\nplainly be invidious to insist upon compliance with that\ncondition in the case of one set of employees and not to do\nso in the case of others. The basic question is whether\nexemption is constitutionally permissible. [942 D]\n (9)(a) Preferential and favoured treatment for some\ncitizens in the matter of employment or appointment to any\noffice under the State would be antithesis of the principle\nof equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity' is one\nof the corner-stones of our Constitution. It finds a\nprominent mention in the preamble to the Constitution and is\none of the pillars which gives support and stength to the\nsocial, political and administrative edifice of the nation.\n[942 F-H]\n\n (b) Privileges, advantages, favours, exemptions\nconcessions specially earmarked for sections of population\nrun counter to the concept of equality of opportunity, they\nindeed eat into the very vitals of the concept. To\ncountenance classification for the purpose of according\npreferential treatment to persons not sought to be recruited\nfrom different sources and in cases not covered by cl. (4)\nof \nArt. 16\n would have the effect of eroding, if not\ndestroying altogether the valued principle of equality of\nopporunity enshrined in cl. (1) of \nArt. 16.\n [943 A-B]\n (10)(a) To introduce fresh notions of classification in\n\nArt. 16(1)\n would necessarily have the effect of vesting the\nState under the garb of classification with power of\ntreating sections of population as favoured classes for\npublic employment. It may not be difficult to circumvent\nthat clause mentioning grounds other than those mentioned in\ncl. (2). [943 C]\n\n (b) To expand the frontiers of classification beyond\nthose which have so far been recognised under cl.(1) of \nArt.\n16\n is bound to result in creation of classes for favoured\nand preferrential treatment for public employment and thus\nerode the concept of equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens in matters relating to employment under the State.\n[943 D-E]\n (11) In construing the provisions of the Constitution,\nthe courts should avoid doctrinaire approach. A constitution\nis the vehicle of the life of a nation and deals with\npractical problems of the Government. It is, therefore,\nimperative that the approach to be adopted by the courts\nwhile construing the provisions of the Constitution should\nbe pragmatic and not one as a result of which the court is\nlikely to get lost in a maze of abstract theories. The\nimportant task of construing the article of a Constitution\nis not an exercise in mere syllogism. It necessitates an\neffort to find the true purpose and object which underlies\nthat article. The historical background, the felt\nnecessities of the time, the balancing of the conflicting\ninterests must all enter into the crucible when the court is\nengaged in the delicate task of construin the provisions of\na constitution. [943 E-H]\n (12) Another thing which must be kept in view while\nconstruing the provisions of the Constitution is to foresee\nas to what would be the impact of that construction not\nmerely on the case in hand but also on the future\n\n919\n\ncases which may arise under those provisions. Out of concern\nfor the facts of one individual case, the courts must not\nadopt a construction the effect of which might be to open\nthe door for making all kinds of inroads into a great ideal\nand desideratum like that of equality of opportunity.\nLikewise, the courts should aviod in the absence of\ncompelling reason, a course that has the effect of\nunsettling a constitutional position which has been settled\nover a long term of years by a series of decisions. [941 A-\nB]\n (13) The liberal approach that may sometimes have been\nadopted in upholding classification under \nArt. 14\n would in\nthe very nature of things be not apt in the context of \nArt.\n16\n when the object underlying \nArt. 16\n is kept in view. [944\nC]\n (14) The State has ample power to make provision for\nsafeguarding the interest of backward classes under cl. (4)\nof \nArt. 16\n which deals with reservation of appointments or\nposts for backward classes not adequately represented in the\nservices under the State. Inaction on the part of the State\nunder or. (4) of \nArt. 16\n cannot justify strained\nconstruction of cl. (1) of \nArt. 16.\n [946 E]\n Per Gupta J. (dissenting)\n (1) Rule 13AA and the orders made thereunder giving\nadditional opportunity in this regard to some out of the\nsame class of employee would be obviously void unless the\nfact that the favoured members of the class belong to\nScheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes made and difference in\nthe position. [987 B]\n There is no force in the contention that \nArt. 16(1)\n\nshould be read in the light of \nArt. 46\n and \n335.\n Neither \nArt.\n46\n and \nArt. 335\n mentions \nArt. 16(1)\n nor \nArt. 16(1)\n refers to\neither of them. All the three Articles coexist in the\nConstitution and if is correct to say that one of them\nshould be read in the light of the other two it is equally\nright to suggest that the two of them should read in the\nlight of the other. This means that the various parts of an\norganie instrument like the Constitution ought to be\nharmoniously construed but that is not the same things as\nsuggesting that even where the scope and ambit of one part\nis clear it should be abridged, extended or amended to prove\nits affinity with another part. Each limb of the body has\nits own function. and to try to make one of them do the work\nof another is both unnecessary and unwise. This might throw\nthe entire system out of gear. [985 C-D]\n (2)(a) It is difficult to see how \nArt. 46\n which\nrequires the State to promote with special care the economic\ninterests of the weaker sections of the people especially of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, can serve as an\naid to the construction of \nArt. 16(1).\n [985 H]\n\n \n(b) \nArt. 335\n cannot furnish any clue to the\nunderstanding of \nArt. 16(1).\n This Article does not create\nany right in the members of the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes which they might claim in the matter of\nappointments to services and posts; one has to look\nelsewhere, to find out the claims conceded to them. \nArt. 335\n\nsays that such claims shall be considered consistently with\nthe administrative efficiency. This is a provision which\ndoes not enlarge but qualify such claims as they may have as\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. [986 C]\n (3) \nArticle 14\n which guarantees equality before the law\nand equal protection of the laws does not insist on absolute\nequality of treatment to all persons in disregard of all\ndifferences among them but provides for equality among\nequals only, \nArt. 16(1)\n contemplates classifications on the\nbasis of eligibility for an appointment; those who have the\nqualifications needed for the post form one class. it also\nimplies that the same class of employees constitute a\nseparate unit. \nArt. 16(1)\n forbids between the members of\nthis class discrimination and denial of equal opportunity in\nthe matter of promotion.

Judging by\nthis test it is not possible to hold that the sub-division\nof Lower Division Clerks into two categories, those who\nbelong to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes those\nwho do not, is reasonable. [987 E-F]\n (5)(a) The special reference to the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes does not suggest that the State should\npromote the economic interests of these castes and tribes at\nthe expense of other \"weaker sections of the people\". [987\nH]\n\n \n(b) There is nothing reasonable in denying to some\nLower Division Clerks the same opportunity for promotion as\nothers have because they do not belong to a particular caste\nor tribe. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, no doubt,\nconstitute a well defined class, but a classification valid\nfor one purpose may not be so for another. In the context of\n\nArt. 16(1)\n the sub-class made by r. 13AA within the same\nclass of employees amounts to discrimination only on grounds\nof race and caste which is forbidden by cl. (2) of \nArt. 16.\n\n[988 B]\n (6) Picking out employees belonging to the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes from the same class of Lower\nDivision Clerks to give them additional opportunity to be\npromoted as Upper Division Clerks is not a measure for the\npromotion of the economic welfare of these castes and\ntribes. Some incidental financial gain to certain\nindividuals, assuming it results in the welfare of the\ncastes and tribes to which they belong in some remote and\nindirect way is not what \nArt. 46\n contemplates. [988 D]\n (7)(a) In any case, \nArt. 16 (1)\n does not permit such\nclassification as made by r. 13AA. That rule may have been\ninspired by \nArt. 46\n which requires the State to take\nmeasures to bridge the education and economic gap between\nthe weaker sections of the people and other citizens, but\n\nArt. 46\n does not qualify the provisions of \nArt. 16(1).\n \nArt.\n16(1)\n speaks of equality of opportunity, not opportunity to\nachieve equality.

[988 F]\n (8) The appalling poverty and backwardness of large\nsections of the people must move the State machinery to do\neverything in its power to better their condition.

Rao and Girish Chandra for\nthe Attorney-General for India.\n\n The following Judgments were delivered :\n\n RAY, C.J. This appeal is by certificate from the\njudgment dated 19 April, 1974 of the High Court of Kerala.\n\n This appell is concerns the validity of Rule 13AA the\nKerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958\nhereinafter called the Rules and two orders which are marked\nP-2 and P-6.\n\n In order to appreciate Rule 13AA, it is necessary to\nrefer to Rules 12, 13A, 13AA. These rules were framed in\nexercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to \nArticle\n309\n of the Constitution. These rules came into existence on\n17 December, 1958.\n\n \"Promotion\" is defined in Rule 2(11) to mean the\nappointment of a member of any category or grade of a\nservice or a class of service to a higher category or grade\nof such service or class.\n\n Rule 12 states that where general educational\nqualifications, special qualifications or special tests are\nprescribed by the Special Rules of a service for any\ncategory, grade or post therein, or in a class thereof,\nwhich are not prescribed for a category or grade in such\nservice or class carrying a lower rate of pay and no member\nin the category or grade carrying the lower rate of pay is\neligible for promotion to such category, grade or post a\nmember in such lower category or grade may be promoted to\nthe category or grade carrying the higher rate of pay\ntemporarily until a member of the former category or grade\nqualified under this rule is available for promotion. A\nmember temporarily promoted under this rule shall not by\nreason only of such promotion, be regarded as a probationer\nin the category or grade to which he has been promoted, or\nbe entitled to any preferential claim to future promotion.\n\n Rule 13 speaks of special qualifications. Rule 13 does\nnot concern this appeal.\n\n The two rules which are of importance in this appeal\nare Rules 13A and 13AA. They are as follows :-\n \"13A. Special and Departmental Tests-Temporary\n exemption for promotion.-Notwithstanding anything\n contained in rule 13, where a pass in a special or\n departmental test is newly prescribed by the Special\n Rules of a service for any category, grade or post\n therein or in any class thereof, a member of a service\n who has not passed the said test but is otherwise\n qualified and suitable for appointment to such class,\n category, grade or post may within 2 years of the\n introduction of the test be appointed thereto\n temporarily.\n\n922\n\n If a member so appointed does not pass the test within\n two years from the date of introduction of the said\n test or when the said test also involves practical\n training within two years after the first chance to\n undergo such training he shall be reverted to the\n class, category or grade or post from which he was\n appointed and shall not again be eligible for\n appointment under this rule :\n\n Provided that a person so reverted shall not by\n reason only of the appointment under this rule be\n entitled to any preferential claim to future\n appointment to the class, category, grade or post, as\n the case may be to which he had been appointed under\n this rule :\n\n Provided further that the period of temporary\n exemption shall be extended by two years in the case of\n a person belonging to any of the scheduled castes or\n scheduled tribes.\n\n Provided also that this rule shall not be\n applicable to tests prescribed for purposes of\n promotion of the executive staff below the rank of Sub\n Inspectors belonging to the Police Department\".\n\n \"13AA. Notwithstanding anything contained in these\n Rules, the Government may, by order, exempt for a\n specified period, any member or members, belonging to a\n Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, and already in\n service, from passing the tests referred to in rule 13\n or rule 13A of the said Rules.\n\n Provided that this rule shall not be applicable to\n tests prescribed for purposes of promotion of the\n executive staff below the rank of Sub Inspectors\n belonging to the Police Department\".\n\n It is necessary to state here that the third proviso to\nRule 13A and the proviso to Rule 13AA were introduced with\neffect from 12 October, 1973. Rule 13AA was introduced with\neffect from 13 January, 1972. Exhibit P-2 is an order dated\n13 January, 1972. The order is made by the Governor. The\norder refers to a memorandum dated 19 June, 1971 from the\nPresident, Kerala Harijan Samskarika Kshema Samithy, State\nCommittee. Trivandrum and a letter dated 13 November, 1971\nfrom the Secretary, Kerala Public Service Commission. The\norder is as follows :-\n\n \"The President, Kerala Harijan Samskarika Kshema\n Samithy, Trivandrum has brought to the notice of\n Government that a large number of Harijan employees are\n facing immediate reversion from their posts for want of\n test qualifications and has therefore requested that\n all Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes emplovees may\n be granted temporary exemption from passing the\n obligatory depart mental tests for a period of two\n years with immediate effect.\n\n (2) Government have examined the matter in\n consultation with the Kerala Public Service Commission\n and are pleased to grant temporary exemption to members\n already\n\n923\n\n in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified and\n special or departmental tests) for a period of two\n years.\n\n (3) The benefit of the above exemption well be\n available to those employees belonging to Scheduled\n Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are already enjoying\n the benefits of temporary exemption from passing newly\n prescribed tests under General Rule 13A. In their case,\n the temporary exemption will expire only on the date of\n expiry of the temporary exemption mentioned in para (2)\n above or on the date of expiry of the existing\n temporary exemption, whichever is later.\n (4) This order will take effect from the date of\n the order\".\n\n Exhibit P-6 is an order dated 11 January, 1974. It is\nan order made by the Governor. The order is as follows :-\n\n \"Government are pleased to order that the period\n of temporary exemption granted to Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes in the G.O. read above from passing\n all tests (unified and special or departmental tests)\n be extended from 13-1-1974 to cover a period during\n which two tests are held by the Public Service\n Commission and results thereof published so that each\n individual gets two chances to appear. Government also\n order that these categories of employees will not be\n given any further extension of time to acquire the test\n qualifications.\"\n\n Pursuant to Rule 13AA which came into force on 13th\nJanuary, 1972 the order Exhibit P-2 was passed on 13\nJanuary, 1972 granting temporary exemption to members\nalready in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified and\nspecial or departmental tests) for a period of two years.\nThe exemption granted by Exhibit P-2 in almost all cases\nwould have expired on 12 January, 1974.\n\n The other impugned order is Exhibit P-6 which was\npassed on 11 January, 1974 gave further exemption to members\nof Scheduled Castes and Tribes from 13 January, 1974 from\npassing tests to cover a period during which two tests would\nbe held by the Public Service Commission and results thereof\npublished so that each individual would get two chances to\nappear within that period. The Government also ordered that\nthese categories of employees would not be given any further\nextension of time to acquire the test qualifications.\n\n On the basis of these exemption orders, several\npromotions have been effected. The respondent alleged in the\nwrit petition that 12 Lower Division Clerks who were members\nof Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were promoted\nwithout test qualification. The further allegation is that\nby an order dated 15 June, 1972, 19 Lower\n\n924\n\nDivision Clerks belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes\nwere promoted as Upper Division Clerks of which 5 were\nunqualified Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members\nand 14 were qualified Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nmembers. By order dated 19 September, 1972, another 8\npromotions of members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes were\nordered of which only two were qualified and the remaining\nsix were unqualified. By another order dated 31st October,\n1972, 7 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes members were\npromoted without qualifying test and one was promoted with\nthe qualifying test. The grievance of the respondent-\npetitioner before the High Court was that out of 51\nvacancies which arose in the category of Upper Division\nClerks in the year 1972, 34 were filled up by Scheduled\nCastes members who did not possess qualifications and only\n17 were given to qualified persons.\n\n The respondent is a Lower Division Clerk working in the\nRegistration Department. For promotion to Upper Division\nClerk in that Department on the basis of seniority, the\nLower Division Clerks have to pass (1) Account Test (Lower),\n(2) Kerala Registration Test and (3) Test in the manual\noffice procedure. The respondent's grievance is that in view\nof certain concessions given to members of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes, they were able to obtain promotions\nearlier than the respondent, though the members of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who were promoted had\nnot passed the tests.\n\n The respondent in the writ petition filed in the High\nCourt asked for a declaration that Rule 13AA is\nunconstitutional and mandamus for compelling the State to\nforbear from giving effect to order dated 13 January, 1972\nmarked Exhibit P-2. The respondent by an affidavit asked for\na similar order that Exhibit P-6 dated 11 January, 1974 be\nset aside.\n\n The respondents' contentions in the High Court were\nthat Rule 13AA of the Service Rules and Exhibits P-2, P-6\nand Exhibit P-7 which was another order dated 31 October\n1972 and all orders of promotion made thereunder were\nviolative of \nArticles 16(1)\n and \n16(2).\n The High Court upheld\nthe contentions of respondent No. 1.\n\n The contention of the State is that the impugned rules\nand orders are not only legal and valid but also support a\nrational classification under \nArticle 16(1).\n\n The contentions on behalf of respondent No. 1 are\nthese. First \nArticle 16\n is a specific application of \nArticle\n14\n in matters relating to employment or appointment to any\nservice in the State. Clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 16\n give\neffect to equality before law guaranteed by \nArticle 14\n and\nto prohibition against discrimination guaranteed by \nArticle\n15(1).\n In other words, \nArticle 16(1)\n is absolute in terms\nguaranteeing equality of opportunity to every indivdiual\ncitizen seeking employment or appointment. Emphasis is\nplaced on similar opportunity and equal treatment for\nseeking employment or appointment. Second, matters relating\nto employment in Article 16(1) in-\n\n925\n\nclude all matters in relation to employment both prior and\nsubsequent to the employment and form part of the terms and\nconditions of service. Equal opportunity is to be given for\nappointment, promotion, termination of employment and\npayment of pension and gratuity. Third, the abridgement of\nequality guaranteed by \nArticle 16(1)\n is only to the extent\ncurtailed by \nArticle 16(4).\n Apart from \nArticle 16(4)\n, the\nright guaranteed under \nArticle 16(1)\n cannot be curtailed.\n\nArticle 16(4)\n is, in substance, an exception to rights\nguaranteed by \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n Fourth, \nArticle 16(4)\n\ndoes not cover the entire field occupied by \nArticle 16(1)\n\nand \n(2).\n Some of the matters relating to employment in\nrespect of which equality of opportunity has been guaranteed\nby \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n do not fall within the mischief of\nnon-obstante clause in \nArticle 16(4).\n To illustrate, clauses\n(1) and (2) of \nArticle 16\n do not prohibit the prescription\nof reasonable rules for selection to any employment or\nappointment in office. Any provision as to the qualification\nfor employment or appointment in office reasonably fixed and\napplicable to all citizens would be consistent with the\ndoctrine of equality of opportunity in \nArticle 16(1).\n\nReasonable qualification of employment for the purpose of\nefficiency of service is justified. Fifth, rule 13AA is\nviolative of \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n The impeached Exhibits\nfall within the same mischief. There is no scope for dealing\nwith Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes different from\nother backward classes. Exemption from qualification\nnecessary for promotion is not conducive to the maintenance\nof efficiency of administration and violates not only\n\nArticle 335\n of the Constitution but also \nArticle 16(1).\n\n Before the introduction of the Kerala State and\nSubordinate Services Ruless 1958 on 17 December, 1958 and\nalso the formation of Kerala State on 1 November, 1956, the\nTravancore-Cochin Government had issued orders on 14 June,\n1956 directing that the standard of qualification should be\nlower for members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nthan compared to others in the matter of examinations\nrelating to various tests. By Government order dated 27\nJune, 1958, it was directed that the peiod of exemption from\npassing tests be extended by two years in the case of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Again by Government\norder dated 2 January, 1961. the period of exemption to\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was further extended\nto 3 years. By another Government order dated 14 January,\n1963, a unified account test (lower) and a test in office\nprocedure were introduced replacing the old tests and as\nthis was treated as a new test, all persons who were\nformerly in Travancore-Cochin or Madras Service were given\ntwo years' time to pass the test and members of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were given extra time\nin accordance with the orders earlier mentioned. A circular\nwas issued on 9 February, 1968 granting 7 years' time from\n14 January, 1963 to members of the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes to pass the unified tests. This period was\nto expire on 14 January, 1970. On 13 January, 1970, an order\nwas passed extending the time for another year upto 14\nJanuary, 1971. On 14 January, 1971 another Government order\nwas issued extending the period by another year.\n\n926\n\n It was brought to the notice of the Government that\nlarge number of Government servants belonging to Scheduled\nCasts and Scheduled Tribes were unable to get their\npromotion because of want of test qualifications. In order\nto give relief to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,\nthe Government incorporated Rule 13AA which enabled the\nGovernment to grant exemption to members of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes for a specified period. On 13 January,\n1972 exemption from passing the tests was granted to members\nof Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for two years. On\n11 January, 1974 order was made under Rule 13AA giving\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes exemption\nfrom passing the tests for the period of two tests to be\nconducted after the order dated 11 January, 1974.\n\n The criterion for promotion of Lower Division Clerks to\nUpper Division Clerks is seniority-cum-merit qualification.\nFor want of test qualification a large number of Lower\nDivision Clerks belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes were passed over. It is because of the aforesaid\nGovernment order dated 13 January, 1972 marked exhibit P-2\nthat promotions were made according to seniority-cum-merit\nqualification. The larger share went to the members of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes because they were\nsenior hands. After the issue of the order dated 13 January,\n1972, 34 out of 51 Lower Division Clerks who were promoted\nbelonged to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These\n34 persons were given temporary exemption from passing the\ndepartmental tests. It also appears that these 34 members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have become senior\nmost in the lower cadre.\n\n \nArticles 14\n, 15\n and \n16\n form part of a string of\nconstitutionally guaranteed rights. These rights supplement\neach other. \nArticle 16\n which ensures to all citizens\nequality of opportunity in matters relating to employment is\nan incident of guarantee of equality contained in Article\n\n14. \nArticle 16(1)\n gives effect to \nArticle 14.\n Both \nArticles\n14\n and \n16(1)\n permit reasonable classification having a nexus\nto the objects to be achieved. Under \nArticle 16\n there can be\na reasonable classification of the employees in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment.\n\n This Court in the State of Gujarat and Anr. etc. v.\nShri Ambica Mills Ltd. Ahmedabad etc.(1) said \"The equal\nprotection of the laws is a pledge of the protection of\nequal laws. But laws may classify. And the very idea of\nclassification is that of inequality. In tackling this\nparadox the Court has neither abandoned the demand for\nequality nor denied the legislative right to classify. It\nhas taken a middle course. It has resolved the contradictory\ndemands of legislative specialization and constitutional\ngenerality by a doctrine of reasonable classification. (See\nJoseph Tussman and Jacobus ten Breck, \"The Equal Protection\nof the Laws\", 37 California Rev. 341.)\"\n\n927\n\n In the Ambica Mills case (supra) this Court explained\nreasonable classification to be one which includes all who\nare similarly situated and none who are not. The question as\nto who are similarly situated has been answered by stating\nthat one must look beyond the classification to the purpose\nof law. \"The purpose of a law may be either the elimination\nof a public mischief or the achievement of some positive\npublic good.\"\n\n Discrimination is the essence of classification.\nEquality is violated if it rests on unreasonable basis. The\nconcept of equality has an inherent limitation arising from\nthe very nature of the constitutional guarantee. Those who\nare similarly circumstanced are entitled to an equal\ntreatment. Equality is amongst equals. Classification is,\ntherefore, to be founded on substantial differences which\ndistinguish persons grouped together from those left out of\nthe groups and such differential attributes must bear a just\nand rational relation to the object sought to be achieved.\n\n \nThe crux of the matter is whether Rule 13AA and the two\norders Exhibits P-2 and P-6 are unconstitutional violating\n\nArticle 16(1).\n \nArticle 16(1)\n speaks of equality of\nopportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment\nunder the State. The impeached Rule and orders relate to\nPromotion from Lower Division Clerks to Upper Division\nClerks. Promotion depends upon passing the test within two\nyears in all cases and exemption is granted to members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for a longer period\nnamely, four years. If there is a rational classification\nconsistent with the purpose for which such classification is\nmade equality is not violated. The categories of\nclassification for purposes of promotion can never be closed\non the contention that they are all members of the same\ncadre in service. If classification is made on educational\nqualifications for purposes of promotion or if\nclassification is made on the ground that the persons are\nnot similarly circumstanced in regard to their entry into\nemployment, such classification can be justified.\nClassification between direct recruits and promotees for\npurposes of promotion has been held to be reasonable in \nC.\nA. Rajendran v. Union of India\n(1).\n\n The respondent contended that apart from \nArticle 16(4)\n\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were not\nentitled to any favoured treatment in regard to promotion.\n\nIn \nT. Devadasan v. The Union of India & Anr.\n(2) reservation\nwas made for backward classes. The number of reserved seats\nwhich were not filled up was carried forward to the\nsubsequent year. On the basis of \"carry forward\" principle\nit was found that such reserved seats might destroy\nequality. To illustrate, if 18 seats were reserved and for\ntwo succesive years the reserved seats were not filled and\nin the third year there were 100 vacancies the result would\nbe that 54 reserved seats would be occupied out of 100\nvacancies. This would destroy equality. On that ground\n\"carry forward\" principle was not sustained in Devadasan's\ncase (supra).\n The same view was taken in the case of M. R.\nBajali and Others v. State of Mysore(3). It was said that\nnot\n\n928\n\nmore than 50 per cent should be reserved for backward\nclasses. This ensures eqalality. \nReservation is not a\nconstitutional compulsion but is discretionary according to\nthe ruling of this Court in \nRajendran\n's case (supra).\n\n \nThere is no denial of equality of opportunity unless\nthe person who complains of discrimination is equally\nsituated with the person or persons who are alleged to have\nbeen favoured. \nArticle 16(1)\n does not bar a reasonable\nclassification of employees or reasonable tests for their\nselection \nState of Mysore v. V. P. Narasinga Rao\n(1).\n\n This equality of opportunity need not be confused with\nabsolute equality. \nArticle 16(1)\n does not prohibit the\nprescription of reasonable rules for selection to any\nemployment or appointment to any office. In regard to\nemployment, like other terms and conditions associated with\nand incidental to it, the promotion to a selection post is\nalso included in the matters relating to employment and even\nin regard to such a promotion to a selection post all that\n\nArticle 16(1)\n guarantees is equality of opportunity to all\ncitizens. \nArticles 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n give effect to equality\nbefore law guaranteed by \nArticle 14\n and to the prohibition\nof discrimination guaranteed by \nArticle 15(1).\n Promotion to\nselection post is covered by \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n\n The power to make reservation, which is conferred on\nthe State, under \nArticle 16(4)\n can be exercised by the State\nin a proper case not only by providing for reservation of\nappointments but also by providing for reservation of\nselection posts. In providing for reservation of\nappointments or posts under \nArticle 16(4)\n the State has to\ntake into consideration the claims of the backward classes\nconsistently with the maintenance of the efficiency of\nadministration. It must not be forgotten that the efficiency\nof administration is of such paramount importance that it\nwould be unwise and impermissible to make any reservation at\nthe cost of efficiency of administration. (General Manager,\nS. Rly. v. Rangachari. The present case is not one of\nreservation of posts by promotion.\n\n \nUnder \nArticle 16(1)\n equality of opportunity of\nemployment means equality as between members of the same\nclass of employees and not equality between members of\nseparate, independent class. The Roadside Station Masters\nand Guards are recruited separately, trained separately and\nhave separate avenues of promotion. The Station Mas ers\nclaimed equality of opportunity for promotion vis-a-vis the\nguards on the ground that they were entitled to equality of\nopportunity. It was said he concept of equality can have no\nexistence except with reference to matters which are common\nas between individuals, between whom equality is predicated.\nThe Road-side Station Masters and Guards were required\nseparately. Therefore, the two form distinct and separate\nclasses and there is no scope for predicating equality or\ninequality of opportunity in matters of promotion. See \nAll\nIndia\n\n929\n\nStation Masters and Assistant Station Masters' Association\nv. General Manager, Central Railways\n(1). The present case is\nnot to create separate avenues of promotion for these\npersons.\n\n The rule of parity is the equal treatment of equals in\nequal circumstances. The rule of differentiation is enacting\nlaws differentiating between different persons or things in\ndifferent circumstances. The circumstances which govern one\nset of persons or objects may not necessarily be the same as\nthose governing and her set of persons or objects so that\nthe question of unequal treatment does not really arise\nbetween persons governed by different conditions and\ndifferent sets of circumstances. The principle of equality\ndoes not mean that every law must have universal application\nfor all persons who are not by nature, attainment or\ncircumstances in the same position and the varying needs of\ndifferent classes of persons require special treatment. The\nlegislature understands and appreciates the need of its own\npeople, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest\nby experience and that its discriminations are based upon\nadequate grounds. The rule of classification is not a\nnatural and logical corollary of the rule of equality, but\nthe rule of differentiation is inherent in the concept of\nequality. Equality means parity of treatment under parity of\nconditions. Equality does not connote absolute equality. A\nclassification in order to be constitutional must rest upon\ndistinctions that are substantial and not merely illusory.\nThe test is whether it has a reasonable basis free from\nartificiality and arbitrariness embracing all and omitting\nnone naturally falling into that category.\n\n The following decisions illustrate how classification\nfor promotion has been upheld within the content of Article\n\n16.\n There can be cases where the differences between the\ntwo groups of recruits may not be sufficient to give any\npreferential treatment to one against the other in the\nmatter of promotions, and in that event a Court may hold\nthat there is no reasonable nexus between the differences\nand the recruitment. [\nGovind Dattatray Kelkar v. Chief\nController of Imports\n(2)].\n\n \nThe equality of opportunity takes within its fold all\nstages of service from initial appointment to its\ntermination including promotion but it does not prohibit the\nprescription of reasonable rules for selection and\npromotion, applicable to all members of a classified group.\n\nGanga Ram v. Union of India\n(3).\n\n \nWhen the petitioner and the direct recruits were\nappointed to Grade `D', there was one class of Grade `D'\nformed of direct recruits and the promotees from the grade\nof artisans. The recruits from both\n\n930\n\nthe sources to Grade `D' were integrated into one class and\nno discrimination could thereafter be made between them.\nThere was only one rule of promotion for both the\ndepartmental promotees and the direct recruits. \nRoshan Lal\nTandon v. Union of India\n(1).\n\n \nIn \nState of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa &\nOrs.\n(2) this Court said that dealing with practical\nexigencies a rule making authority may be guided by\nrealities just as the legislature \"is free to recognise\ndegrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those\nclasses of cases where the need is deemed to be the\nclearest\". Educational qualifications \nin that case\n were\nrecognised as criteria for determining the validity of\nclassification.\n \nThe discrimination is not in relation to the\nsource of recruitment unlike in \nRoshan Lal\n's case (supra).\n\n The rule of equality within \nArticles 14\n and \n16(1)\n will\nnot be violated by a rule which will ensure equality of\nrepresentation in the services for unrepresented classes\nafter satisfying the basic needs of efficiency of\nadministration. \nArticle 16(2)\n rules out some basis of\nclassification including race, caste, descent, place of\nbirth etc. \nArticle 16(4)\n clarifies and explains that\nclassification on the basis of backwardness does not fall\nwithin \nArticle 16(2)\n and is legitimate for the purposes of\n\nArticle 16(1).\n If preference shall be given to a particular\nunder-represented community other than a backward class or\nunder-represented State in an All India Service such a rule\nwill contravene \nArticle 16(2).\n A similar rule giving\npreference to an underrepresented backward community is\nvalid and will not contravene \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n and \n16(2).\n\nArticle 16(4)\n removes any doubt in this respect.\n\n The principle of equality is applicable to employment\nat all stages and in all respects, namely, initial\nrecruitment, promotion, retirement, payment of pension and\ngratuity. With regard to promotion the normal principles are\neither merit-cum-seniority or seniority-cum-merit.\nSeniority-cum-merit means that given the minimum necessary\nmerit requisite for efficiency of administration, the senior\nthough the less meritorious shall have priority. This will\nnot violate \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n and \n16(2).\n A rule which\nprovides that given the necessary requisite merit, a member\nof the backward class shall get priority to ensure adequate\nrepresentation will not similarly violate \nArticle 14\n or\n\nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n The relevant touchstone of validity\nis to find out whether the rule of preference secures\nadequate representation for the unrepresented backward\ncommunity or goes beyond it.\n\n The classification of employees belonging to Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes for allowing them an extended\nperiod of two years for passing the special tests for\npromotion is a just and reasonable classification having\nrational nexus to the object of providing equal opportunity\nfor all citizens in matters relating to employment or\nappointment to public office. Granting of temporary\nexemptions from\n\n931\n\nspecial tests to the personnel belonging to Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes by executive orders has been an\nintegral feature of the service conditions in Kerala from\nits very inception on 1 November, 1956. That was the pattern\nin Travancore-Cochin State. The special treatment accorded\nto the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Government\nservice which had become part and parcel of the conditions\nof service over these long periods amply justify the\nclassification of the members of the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes as a whole by the impugned rule and orders\nchallenged. What was achieved by the Government orders is\nnow given a statutory basis by Rule 13AA. The historical\nbackground of these rules justifies the classification of\nthe personnel of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nin service for the purpose of granting them exemption from\nspecial tests with a view to ensuring them the equality of\ntreatment and equal opportunity in matters of employment\nhaving regard to their backwardness and under representation\nin the employment of the State.\n\n The Constitution makes a classification of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in numerous provisions and gives\na mandate to the State to accord special or favoured\ntreatment to them. \nArticle 46\n contains a Directive Principle\nof State Policy-fundamental in the governance of the country\nenjoining the State to promote with special care educational\nand economic interests of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes and to protect them from any social injustice and\nexploitation. \nArticle 335\n enjoins that the claims of the\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the\nservices and posts in the Union and the States shall be\ntaken into consideration. \nArticle 338\n provides for\nappointment by the President of a Special officer for the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to investigate all\nmatters relating to the safeguards provided for them under\nthe Constitution. \nArticle 341\n enables the President by\npublic notification to specify castes, races or tribes which\nshall be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in the States and the\nUnion Territories. \nArticle 342\n contains provision for\nsimilar notification in respect of Scheduled Tribes. \nArticle\n366(24)\n and \n(25)\n defines Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes. The classification by the impugned rule and the\norders is with a view to securing adequate representation to\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the services of the\nState as otherwise they would stagnate in the lowest rung of\nthe State services.\n\n \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution states that claims of\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall\nbe taken into consideration in the making of appointments to\nthe services and posts in connection with affairs of the\nState consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of\nadministration. The impugned rule and the impugned orders\nare related to this constitutional mandate. Without\nproviding for relaxation of special tests for a temporary\nperiod it would not have been possible to give adequate\npromotion to the Lower Division Clerks belonging to\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the posts of Upper\nDivision Clerks. Only those Lower Division Clerks who were\nsenior in service will get the benefit of the relaxation\ncon-\n\n932\n\ntemplated by Rule 13AA and the impeached orders. Promotion\nto Upper Division from Lower Division is governed by the\nrule of seniority subject only to passing of the qualified\ntest. The temporary relaxation of test qualification made in\nfavour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is warranted\nby their inadequate representation in the services and their\noverall backwardness. The classification of the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes already in service\nmade under Rule 13AA and the challenged orders for exempting\nthem for a temporary period from passing special tests are\nwithin the purview of constitutional mandate under \nArticle\n335\n in consideration of their claims to redress imbalance in\npublic service and to bring about parity in all communities\nin public services.\n\n The High Court was wrong in basing its conclusion that\nthe result of application of the impeached Rule and the\norders is excessive and exorbitant namely that out of 51\nposts, 34 were given to the members of the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes. The promotions made in the services as\na whole are nowhere near 50% of the total number of posts.\nThe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes constitute 10% of\nthe State's population. Their share in the gazetted services\nof the State is said to be 2% namely 184 out of 8,780. Their\nshare in the non-gazetted appointments is only 7% namely\n11,437 out of 1,62,784. It is therefore, correct that Rule\n13AA and the orders are meant to implement not only the\ndirection under \nArticle 335\n but also the Directive Principle\nunder \nArticle 46.\n\n Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not a caste\nwithin the ordinary meaning of caste. \nIn \nBhaiyalal v.\nHarikishan Singh and Ors.\n(1) this Court held that an enquiry\nwhether the appellant there belonged to the Dohar caste\nwhich was not recognised as a Scheduled Caste and his\ndeclaration that he belonged to the Charmar caste which was\na Scheduled Caste could not be permitted because of the\nprovisions contained in \nArticle 341.\n No Court can come to a\nfinding that any caste or any tribe is a Scheduled Caste or\nScheduled Tribe. Scheduled Caste is a caste as notified\nunder \nArticle 366(25).\n A notification is issued by the\nPresident under \nArticle 341\n as a result of an elaborate\nenquiry. The object of \nArticle 341\n is to provide protection\nto the members of Scheduled Castes having regard to the\neconomic and educational backwardness from which they\nsuffer.\n\n Our Constitution aims at equality of statuts and\nopportunity for all citizents including those who are\nsocially, economically and educationally backward. The\nclaims of members of backward classes require adequate\nrepresentation in legislative and executive bodies. If\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, who are said by this\nCourt to be backward classes, can maintain minimum necessary\nrequirement of administrative efficiency, not only\nrepresentation but also preference may be given to them to\nenforce equality and to eliminate inequality. \nArticles 15(4)\n\nand \n16(4)\n bring out the position of backward classes to\nmerit equality. Special provisions are made for the\nadvancement of backward classes and reservations of\nappointments and posts for them to secure adequate\nrepresentation. These provisions will bring\n\n933\n\nout the content of equality guaranteed by \nArticles 14\n, 15(1)\n\nand \n16(1).\n The basic concept of equality is equality of\nopportunity for appointment. Preferential treatment for\nmembers of backward classes with due regard to\nadministrative efficiency alone can mean equality of\nopportunity for all citizens. Equality under \nArticle 16\n\ncould not have a different content from equality under\n\nArticle 14.\n Equality of opportunity for unequals can only\nmean aggravation of inequality. Equality of opportunity\nadmits discrimination with reason and prohibits\ndiscrimination without reason. Discrimination with reasons\nmeans rational classification for differential treatment\nhaving nexus to the constitutionally permissible object.\nPreferential representation for the backward classes in\nservices with due regard to administrative efficiency is\npermissible object and backward classes are a rational\nclassification reconginsed by our Constitution. Therefore,\ndifferential treatment in standards of selection are within\nthe concept of equality.\n\n A rule in favour of an under-represented backward\ncommunity specifying the basic needs of efficiency of\nadministration will not contravene \nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n and\n\n16(2).\n The rule in the present case does not impair the test\nof efficiency in administration inasmuch as members of\nScheduled Castes and Tribes who are promoted have to acquire\nthe qualification of passing the test. The only relaxation\nwhich is done in their case is that they are granted two\nyears more time than others to acquire the qualification.\nScheduled Castes and Tribes are descriptive of backwardness.\nIt is to the aim of our Constitution to bring them up from\nhandicapped position to improvement. If classification is\npermissible under \nArticle 14\n, it is equally permissible\nunder \nArticle 16\n, because both the Articles lay down\nequality. The quality and concept of equality is that if\npersons are dissimilarly placed they cannot be made equal by\nhaving the same treatment. Promotion of members of Scheduled\nCastes and Tribes under the impeached rules and orders is\nbased on the classification with the object of securing\nrepresentation to members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes.\nEfficiency has been kept in view and not sacrificed.\n\n All legitimate methods are available for equality of\nopportunity in services under \nArticle 16(1).\n \nArticle 16(1)\n\nis affirmative whereas \nArticle 14\n is negative in language.\n\nArticle 16(4)\n indicates one of the methods of achieving\nequality embodied in \nArticle 16(1).\n \nArticle 16(1)\n using the\nexpression \"equality\" makes it relatable to all matters of\nemployment from appointment through promotion and\ntermination to payment of pension and gratuity. \nArticle\n16(1)\n permits classification on the basis of object and\npurpose of law or State action except classification\ninvolving discrimination prohibited by \nArticle 16(2).\n Equal\nprotection of laws necessarily involves classification. The\nvalidity of the classification must be adjudged with\nreference to the purpose of law. The classification in the\npresent case is justified because the purpose of\nclassification is to enable members of Scheduled Castes and\nTribes to find representation by promotion to a limited\nextent. From the point of view of time a differential\ntreatment is given to members of Scheduled Castes and Tribes\nfor the purpose of giving them equality consistent with\nefficiency.\n\n934\n\n For the foregoing reasons, I uphold the validity of\nRule 13AA and Exhibits P-2 and P-6. The appeal is accepted.\nThe judgment of the High Court is set aside. Parties will\npay and bear their own costs.\n\n KHANNA, J. Whether the State Government can grant\nexemption for specified period to employees belonging only\nto the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes from passing\ndepartmental test for the purpose of promotion under clause\n(1) of \narticle 16\n of the Constitution is the important\nquestion which arises for determination in this appeal filed\non certificate by the State of Kerala and the Inspector\nGeneral of Registration against the judgment of the Kerala\nHigh Court. The High Court answered the question in the\nnegative in a petition filed by N. M. Thomas, lower division\nclerk of the Registration Department of the Kerala State,\nrespondent No. 1, under \narticle 226\n of the Constitution.\n\n According to clause (a) of rule 13 in Part II of the\nKerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958\n(hereinafter referred to as the rules) framed under \narticle\n309\n of the Constitution, no person shall be eligible for\nappointment to any service, class, category or grade or any\npost borne on the cadre thereof unless he possesses such\nspecial qualifications and has passed such special tests as\nmay be prescribed in that behalf in the Special Rules. In\nJanuary 1963 a unified test was prescribed by the Kerala\nGovernment for lower division clerks for promotion to the\nupper division. A pass in the test in the Manual of Office\nProcedure, Account Test and the Registration Test was\nobligatory for promotion of lower division clerks as upper\ndivision clerks in the Registration Department. Rule 13A,\nhowever, provided for temporary exemption from passing a\nnewly prescribed special or departmental test for a period\nof two years. Rule 13A reads as under :\n\n \"Notwithstanding anything contained in rule 13,\n where a pass in a special or departmental test is newly\n prescribed by the Special Rules of a service for any\n category, grade or post therein or in any class\n thereof, a member of a service who has not passed the\n said test but is otherwise qualified and suitable for\n appointment to such class, category, grade or post may\n within 2 years of the introduction of the test be\n appointed thereto temporarily. If a member so appointed\n does not pass the test within two years from the date\n of introduction of the said test or when the said test\n also involves practical training, within two years\n after the first chance to undergo such training he\n shall be reverted to the class, category or grade or\n post from which he was appointed and shall not again be\n eligible for appointment under this rule :\n\n Provided that a person so reverted shall not by\n reason only of the appointment under this rule be\n entitled to any preferential claim to future\n appointment to the class, category, grade or post, as\n the case may be to which he had been appointed under\n this rule :\n\n935\n\n Provided further that the period of temporary\n exemption shall be extended by two years in the case of\n a person belonging to any of the scheduled castes or\n scheduled tribes.\n\n Provided also that this rule shall not be\n applicable to tests prescribed for purposes of\n promotion of the executive staff below the rank of Sub\n Inspectors belonging to the Police Department.\"\n\n On January 13, 1972 rule 13AA was inserted in the\nrules. It reads as under :\n\n \"13A Notwithstanding anything contained in these\n rules, the Government may, by order, exempt for a\n specified period, any member or members, belonging to a\n Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, and already in\n service, from passing the tests referred to in rule 13\n or rule 13A of the said Rules.\n\n Provided that this rule shall not be applicable to\n tests prescribed for purposes of promotion of the\n executive staff below the rank of Sub Inspectors\n belonging to the Police Department.\"\n\nThe following order was issued by the State Government on\nJanuary 13, 1972 :\n\n \"The President, Kerala Harijan Samaskarika Kshema\n Samithy, Trivandrum has brought to the notice of\n Government that a large number of Harijan employees are\n facing immediate reversion from their posts for want of\n test qualifications and has therefore requested that\n all Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes employees may\n be granted temporary exemption from passing the\n obligatory departmental tests for a period of two years\n with immediate effect.\n\n (2) Government have examined the matter in\n consultation with the Kerala Public Service Commission\n and are pleased to grant temporary exemption to members\n already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled\n Castes and Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests\n (unified and special or departmental tests) for a\n period of two years.\n\n (3) The benefit of the above exemption will be\n available to those employees belonging to Scheduled\n Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are already enjoying\n the benefits of temporary exemption from passing newly\n prescribed tests under General Rule 13A. In their case\n the temporary exemption will expire only on the date of\n expiry of the temporary exemption mentioned in para (2)\n above or on the date of expiry of the existing\n temporary exemption, whichever is later.\n (4) This order will take effect from the date of\n the order.\"\n\n936\n\nDuring the pendency of the writ petition in the High Court,\na further order was issued by the State Government on July\n11, 1974 for extending the period of exemption as under :\n\n \"1. G.O. (NS) No. 22/PD dated 13-1-1972.\n\n .....................\n\n .....................\n\n .....................\n\n ORDER\n Government are pleased to order that the period of\n temporary exemption granted to Scheduled Castes and\n Scheduled Tribes in the G.O. read above from passing\n all tests (unified and special or departmental tests)\n be extended from 13-1-1974 to cover a period during\n which two tests are held by the Public Service\n Commission and results thereof published so that each\n individual gets two chances to appear. Government also\n order that these categories of employees will not be\n given any further extension of time to acquire the test\n qualifications.\"\n\n Respondent No. 1 passed all the tests by November 2,\n1971. The other respondents, who are members of scheduled\ncastes and scheduled tribes and who too were lower division\nclerks working in the Registration Department of the State,\nwere promoted as upper division clerks even though they had\nnot passed the tests mentioned above. Respondent No. 1 was\nnot, however, promoted despite the fact that he had passed\nthe requisite tests. In 1972 out of 51 lower division clerks\npromoted as upper division clerks, 34 belonged to scheduled\ncastes and tribes. Respondent No. 1 thereupon filed petition\nunder \narticle 226\n on March 15, 1972 for a declaration that\nrule 13AA under which exemption had been granted to the\nother respondents in the matter of promotion was violative\nof \narticle 16\n of the Constitution. Prayer was also made for\nquashing order dated January 13, 1972 reproduced above by\nwhich exemption was actually granted to scheduled castes and\nscheduled tribes employees from passing the obligatory\ndepartmental test for a period of two years.\n\n The petition was resisted by the appellants and the\nother respondents and it was averred on their behalf that\nthe impugned rule and order were not violative of article\n\n16. The High Court held that rule 13AA was void being\nviolative of clauses (1) and (2) of \narticle 16\n of the\nConstitution. Orders dated January 13, 1972 and January 11,\n1974 as well as other orders promoting members of Scheduled\nCastes and scheduled Tribes who had not passed the\nprescribed test were quashed. The High Court also expressed\nthe view that the promotion of 34 out of 51 persons even\nthough they had not passed the necessary test was not\nconducive to the maintenance of efficiency of\nadministration. The order in this respect was stated to be\nviolative of \narticle 335\n of the Constitution.\n\n In appeal before us the learned Advocate-General on\nbehalf of the appellants has contended that the impugned\nrule and orders are cons-\n\n937\n\ntitutionally valid under clause (1) of \narticle 16.\n He has in\nthis context invited our attention to \narticles 46\n and \n335\n of\nthe Constitution. It has, however, been frankly conceded by\nthe Advocate-General that he does not rely upon clause (4)\nof \narticle 16\n of the Constitution for sustaining the\nvalidity of the impugned rule and orders. The stand taken on\nbehalf of the appellants has also been supported by the\nlearned Solicitor-General as well as by Mr. Garg on behalf\nof respondents other than respondent No. 1. As against the\nabove, Mr. Krishnamurthy Iyer on behalf of respondent No. 1\nhas canvassed for the correctness of the view taken by the\nHigh Court and has contended that the validity of the\nimpugned rule and orders cannot be justified under clause\n(1) of \narticle 16.\n\n It may be apposite at this stage to reproduce \narticles\n16\n, 46\n and \n335\n of the Constitution :\n\n \"16. (1) There shall be equality of opportunity\n for all citizens in matters relating to employment or\n appointment to any office under the State.\n (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion,\n race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or\n any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated\n against in respect of, any employment or office under\n the State.\n\n (3) Nothing in this article shall prevent\n Parliament from making any law prescribing, in regard\n to a class or classes of employment or appointment to\n an office under the Government of, or any local or\n other authority within, a State or Union territory, any\n requirement as to residence within that State or Union\n territory prior to such employment or appointment.\n (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the\n State from making any provision for the reservation of\n appointments or posts in favour of any backward class\n of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not\n adequately represented in the services under the State.\n (5) Nothing in this article shall affect the\n operation of any law which provides that the incumbent\n of any office in connection with the affairs of any\n religious or denominational institution or any member\n of the governing body thereof shall be a person\n professing a particular religion or belonging to a\n particular denomination.\n\n 46. The State shall promote with special care\n educational and economic interests of the weaker\n sections of the people, and, in particular, of the\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall\n protect them from social injustice and all forms of\n exploitation.\n\n 335. The claims of the members of the Scheduled\n Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into\n consideration, consistently with the maintenance of\n efficiency of adminis-\n\n938\n\n tration, in the making of appointments to services and\n posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of\n a State.\"\n\n \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution enshrines the principle\nof equality before the law. \nArticle 15\n prohibits\ndiscrimination against citizens on grounds only of religion,\nrace, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. \nArticle 16\n\nrepresents one fact of the guarantee of equality. According\nto this article, there shall be equality of opportunity for\nall citizens in matters relating to employment or\nappointment to any office under the State. No citizen, it is\nfurther provided, shall on grounds only of religion, race,\ncaste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of\nthem, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect\nof, any employment or office under the State. \nArticles 14\n,\n15\n and \n16\n underline the importance which the framers of our\nConstitution attached to ensuring equality of treatment.\nSuch equality has a special significance in the matter of\npublic employment. It was with a view to prevent any\ndiscrimination in that field that an express provision was\nmade to guarantee equality of opportunity for all citizens\nin matters relating to employment or appointment to any\noffice under the State.\n\n At the same time the framers of the Constitution were\nconscious of the backwardness of large sections of the\npopulation. It was also plain that because of their\nbackwardness those sections of the population would not be\nin a position to compete with advanced sections of the\ncommunity who had all the advantages of affluence and better\neducation. The fact that the doors of competition were open\nto them would have been a poor consolation to the members of\nthe backward classes because the chances of their success in\nthe competition were far too remote on account of the\ninherent handicap and disadvantage from which they suffered.\nThe result would have been that, leaving aside some\nexceptional cases, the members of backward classes would\nhave hardly got any representation in jobs requiring\neducational background. It would have thus resulted in\nvirtually repressing those who were already repressed. The\nframers of the Constitution being conscious of the above\ndisadvantage from which backward classes were suffering\nenjoined upon the State in \narticle 46\n of the Constitution to\npromote with special care educational and economic interests\nof the weaker sections of the people, in particular of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and also protect them\nfrom social injustice and all forms of exploitation. To give\neffect to that objective in the field of public employment,\na provision was made in clause (4) of \narticle 16\n that\nnothing in that article would prevent the State from making\nany provision for the reservation of appointments or posts\nin favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the\nopinion of the State, was not adequately represented in the\nservices under the State. Under the above clause, it is\npermissible for the State, in case it finds the\nrepresentation of any backward class of citizens in the\nState services to be not adequate, to make provision for the\nreservation of appointments or posts in favour of that\nbackward class of citizens. The reservation of seats for the\nmembers of the backward classes was not, however, to be at\nthe cost of efficiency. This fact was brought out in \narticle\n335\n,\n\n939\n\naccording to which the claims of the members of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken\ninto consideration, consistently with the maintenance of\nefficiency of administration, in the making of appointments\nto services and posts in connection with the affairs of the\nUnion or of a State. In view of that it is not permissible\nto waive the requirement of minimum educational\nqualification and other standards essential for the\nmaintenance of efficiency of service.\n\n \nIt is further plain that the reservation of posts for a\nsection of population has the effect of conferring a special\nbenefit on that section of the population because it would\nenable members belonging to that section to get employment\nor office under the State which otherwise in the absence of\nreservation they could not have got. Such preferential\ntreatment is plainly a negation of the equality of\nopportunity for all citizens in matters relating to\nemployment or appointment to an office under the State.\nClause (4) of \narticle 16\n has, therefore, been construed as a\nproviso or exception to clause (1) of that article (see \nThe\nGeneral Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n(\n1) and T.\nDevadasan v. The Union of India & Anr.\n (2).\n\n It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that\nequality of treatment does not forbid reasonable\nclassification. Reference in this context is made to the\nwell accepted principle that \narticle 14\n of the Constitution\nforbids class legislation but does not forbid\nclassification. Permissible classification, it is equally\nwell established, must be founded on an intelligible\ndifferentia which distinguishes persons or things that are\ngrouped together from others left out of the group and the\ndifferentia must have a rational relation to the object\nsought to be achieved by the statute in question. It is\nurged that the same principle should apply when the court is\nconcerned with the equality of opportunity for all citizens\nin matters relating to employment or appointment to any\noffice under the State. \nIn this respect I may observe that\nthis Court has recognized the principle of classification in\nthe context of clause (1) of \narticle 16\n in matters where\nappointments are from two different sources, e.g., guards\nand station masters, promotees and direct recrits, degree\nholder and diploma holder engineers (see \nAll India Station\nMasters & Asstt. Station Masters' Assn. & Ors. v. General\nManager\n, Central Railway & Ors.,(3) S. G. Jaisnghani v.\nUnion of India & Ors.(\n1) and State of Jammu & Kashmir v.\nTriloki Nath Khosa & Ors.\n(5). The question with which we are\nconcerned, however, is whether we can extend the above\nprinciple of classification so as to allow preferential\ntreatment to employees on the ground that they are members\nof the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. So far as this\nquestion is concerned I am of the view that the provision of\npreferential treatment for members of backward classes,\nincluding scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, is that\ncontained in clause (4) of \narticle 16\n which permits\nreservation of posts for them. There is\n\n940\n\nno scope for spelling out such preferential treatment from\nthe language of clause (1) of \narticle 16\n because the\nlanguage of that clause does not warrant any preference to\nany citizen against another citizen. The opening words of\nclause (4) of \narticle 16\n that \"nothing in this article shall\nprevent the State from making any provision for the\nreservation of appointments or posts in favour of backward\nclass of citizens\" indicate that but for clause (4) it would\nnot have been permissible to make any reservation of\nappointments or posts in favour of any backward class of\ncitizens.\n\n \nIn the case of \nAll India Station Masters' & Asstt.\nStation Masters' Association\n (supra) the Roadside Masters of\nthe Central Railway Challenged the constitutionality of\npromotion of guards to higher grade station masters' posts.\nThe petitioners' contention was that the channel of\npromotions amounted to a denial of equal opportunity as\nbetween Roadside Station Masters and guards in the matter of\npromotion and thus contravened clause (1) of \narticle 16\n of\nthe Constitution. It was urged that taking advantage of this\nchannel of promotions, guards became station masters at a\nmuch younger age than Roadside Station Masters who reached\nthe scale when they were much older. According to the\npetitioners, Roadside Station Masters and guards really\nformed one and the same class of employees. This Court\nrejected that contention and held that the Roadside Station\nMasters belonged to a wholly distinct and separate class\nfrom guards and so there could be no question of equality of\nopportuntiy in matters of promotions as between Roadside\nStation Masters and guards. It was further laid down that\nthe question of denial of equal opportunity required serious\nconsideration only as between the members of the same class.\nThe concept of equal opportunity in matters of employment\ndid not apply as between members of different classes of\nemployees under the State. Equality of opportunity in\nmatters of employment could be predicated only between\npersons who were either seeking the same employment, or had\nobtained the same employment. Equality of opportunity in\nmatters of promotion must mean equality between members of\nthe same class of employees and not equality between members\nof separate, independent classes.\n \nIn the case of \nJaisinghani\n\n(supra) the dispute was about seniority between two classes\nof income-tax service, the direct recruits to class I grade\nII and promotees from class II to class I grade II. For the\npurpose of promotion, the Government fixed a ratio of 2 to 1\nfor direct recruits and promotees. It was in that context\nand on those facts that this Court laid down that it is not\ncorrect to say that all officers appointed to class I, grade\nII service formed one class and that after the officers have\nbeen once recruited there could be no distinction between\ndirect recruits and promotees. It is really a case of\nrecruitment to the service from two different sources and\nthe adjustment of seniority between them. The concent of\nequality in the matter of promotion can be predicated only\nwhen the promotees are drawn from the same source. If the\npreferential treatment of one source in relation to the\nother is based on the differences between the two sources,\nand the said differences have a reasonable relation to the\nnature of the office it can legitimately be sustained on the\n\n941\n\nbasis of a valid classification. The reason for the\nclassification \nin that case\n was that the higher echelons of\nthe service should be filled by experienced officers\npossessing not only a high degree of ability but also first-\nrate experience.\n \nIn the case of \nTriloki Nath Khosa\n (supra)\nthe question before the Court was with regard to the\nvalidity of a rule which provided that only those assistant\nengineers would be eligible for promotion as executive\nengineers who possessed a degree in engineering. The\nvalidity of this rule was challenged by assistant engineers\nwho were diploma-holders and did not possess the degree in\nengineering. This Court held that though persons appointed\ndirectly and by promotion were integrated into a common\nclass of assistant engineers, they could for purposes of\npromotion to the cadre of executive engineers be classified\non the basis of educational qualifications. The rule\nproviding that graduates shall be eligible for such\npromotion to the exclusion of diploma-holders was held to be\nnot violative of \narticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. It\nwould thus appear that in each of the above cases the Court\nwas concerned with two categories of employees, each one of\nwhich category constituted a separate and distinct class.\nDifferential treatment for those classes was upheld in the\ncontext of their educational and other qualifications and\nbecause of the fact that they constituted distinct and\nseparate classes. Not much argument is needed to show that a\nrule requiring that an official must possess a degree in\nengineering before he can be promoted to the post of\nexecutive engineer is conceived in the interest of\nefficiency of service. A classification based upon that\nconsideration is obviously valid. Likewise, classification\nbased upon the consideration that one category of employees\nare direct recruits while others are promotes, is\npermissible classification because the two categories of\nemployees constitute two separate and distinct classes. The\nsame is true of roadside station masters and guards.\nClassification of employees in each of these cases was\nlinked with the nature of their initial employment or\neducational qualifications and had nothing to do with the\nfact that they belonged to any particular section of the\npopulation. A classification based upon the first two\nfactors was upheld because it was conceived in the interest\nof efficiency of service and because they constituted two\ndifferent classes in view of the fact that they were\ninitially appointed to posts of different categories. Such\nclassification does not impinge upon the rule of equality of\nopportunity. As against that, a classification based upon\nthe consideration that an employee belongs to a particular\nsection of the population with a view to accord preferential\ntreatment for promotion is clear violation of equality of\nopportunity enshrined in clause (1) of \narticle 16.\n In no\ncase has the Court ever accepted and upheld under \narticle\n16(1)\n classification and differential treatment for the\npurpose of promotion among employees who possessing the same\neducational qualifications were initially appointed as in\nthe present case to the same category of posts, viz., that\nof lower division clerks.\n \nThe present case falls squarely\nwithin the dictum \nlaid down in\n the case of \nStation Masters'\n& Asstt. Station Masters' Association\n (supra) that equaliy\nof opportunity in matters of employment could be predicated\nbetween persons who were either seeking the same\n\n942\n\nemployment or had obtained the same employment. The\nessential object of various rules dealing with appointment\nto posts under the State and promotion to higher posts is to\nensure efficiency of service. Classification upheld under\nclause (1) of \narticle 16\n subserved and in no case militated\nagainst the attainment of that object. Exemption granted to\na class of employees, even though for a limited period from\npassing the departmental tests which have been prescribed\nfor the purpose of promotion would obviously be subversive\nof the object to ensure efficiency of service. It cannot be\ndisputed that departmental tests are prescribed with a view\nto appraise and ensure efficiency of different employees. To\npromote employees even though they have not passed such\nefficiency test can hardly be consistent with the\ndesideratum of ensuring efficiency in administation.\n\n Much has been made of the fact that exemption from\npassing departmental tests granted to members of scheduled\ncastes and scheduled tribes is not absolute but only for a\nlimited period. This fact, in our opinion, would not lend\nconstitutionality to the impugned rule and orders. Exemption\ngranted to a section of employees while being withheld from\nthe remaining employees has obvious element of\ndiscrimination between those to whom it is granted and those\nfrom whom it is withheld. If the passing of departmental\ntests is an essential condition of promotion, it would\nplainly be invidious to insist upon compliance with that\ncondition in the case of one set of employees and not to do\nso in the case of other. The basic question is whether\nexemption is constitutionally permissible. If the answer to\nthat question be in the negative, the fact that exemption is\nfor a limited period would not make any material difference.\nIn either event the vice of discrimination from which\nexemption suffers would contaminate it and stamp it with\nunconstitutionality. Exemption for a limited period to be\nconstitutionally valid cannot be granted to one set of\nemployees and withheld from the other.\n\n What clause (1) of \narticle 16\n ensures is equality of\nopportunity for all citizens as individuals in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment to any office under\nthe State. It applies to them all, the least deserving as\nwell as the most virtuous. Preferential and favoured\ntreatment for some citizens in the matter of employment or\nappointment to any office under the State would be\nantithesis of the principle of equality of opportunity.\nEquality of opportunity in matters of employment guaranteed\nby clause (1) of \narticle 16\n is intended to be real and\neffective. It is not something abstract or illusory. It is a\ncommand to be obeyed, not one to be defied or circumvented.\nIt cannot be reduced to shambles under some cloak. Immunity\nor exemption granted to a class, however limited, must\nnecessarily have the effect of according favoured treatment\nto that class and of creating discrimination against others\nto whom such immunity or exemption is not granted. Equality\nof opportunity is one of the corner-stones of our\nConstitution. It finds a prominent mention in the preamble\nto the Constitution and is one of the pillars which gives\nsupport and strength to the social, political and\nadministrative edifice of the nation. Privileges,\nadvantages, favours, exemptions,\n\n943\n\nconcessions specially earmarked for sections of population\nrun counter to the concept of equality of opportunity, they\nindeed eat into the very vitals of that concept. To\ncountenance classification for the purpose of according\npreferential treatment to persons not sought to be recruited\nfrom different sources and in cases not covered by clause\n(4) of \narticle 16\n would have the effect of eroding, if not\ndestroying altogether, the valued principle of equality of\nopportunity enshrined in clause (1) of \narticle 16.\n\n The proposition that to overdo classification is to\nundermine equality is specially true in the context of\n\narticle 16(1).\n To introduce fresh notions of classification\nin \narticle 16(1)\n, as is sought to be done in the present\ncase, would necessarily have the effect of vesting the State\nunder the garb of classification with power of treating\nsections of population as favoured classes for public\nemployment. The limitation imposed by clause (2) of \narticle\n16\n may also not prove very effective because, as has been\npointed out during the course of arguments, that clause\nprevents discrimination on grounds only of religion, race,\ncaste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of\nthem. It may not be difficult to circumvent that clause by\nmentioning grounds other than those mentioned in clause (2).\n\n To expand the frontiers of classification beyond those\nwhich have so far been recognized under clause (1) of\n\narticle 16\n is bound to result in creation of classes for\nfavoured and preferential treatment for public employment\nand thus erode the concept of equality of opportunity for\nall citizens in matters relating to employment under the\nState.\n\n In construing the provisions of the Constitution we\nshould avoid a doctrinaire approach. A Constitution is the\nvehicle of the life of a nation and deals with practical\nproblems of the government. It is, therefore, imperative\nthat the approach to be adopted by the courts while\nconstruing the provisions of the Constitution should be\npragmatic and not one as a result of which the court is\nlikely to get lost in a maze of abstract theories. Indeed,\nso far as theories are concerned, human thinking in its full\nefforescence, free from constraints and inhibitions, can\ntake such diverse forms that views and reasons apparently\nlogical and plausible can be found both in favour of and\nagainst a particular theory. If one eminent thinker supports\none view, support for the opposite view can be found in the\nwritings of another equally eminent thinker. Whatever indeed\nmay be the conclusion, arguments not lacking in logic can be\nfound in support of such conclusion. The important task of\nconstruing the articles of a Constitution is not an exercise\nin mere syllogism. It necessitates an effort to find the\ntrue purpose and object which underlies that article. The\nhistorical background, the felt necessities of the time, the\nbalancing of the conflicting interests must all enter into\nthe crucible when the court is engaged in the delicate task\nof construing the provisions of a Constitution. The words of\nHolmes that life of law is not logic but experience have a\ndirect relevance in the above context.\n\n Another thing which must be kept in view while\nconstruing the provisions of the Constitution is to foresee\nas to what would be the\n\n944\n\nimpact of that construction not merely on the case in hand\nbut also on the future cases which may arise under those\nprovisions. Out of our concern for the facts of one\nindividual case, we must not adopt a construction the effect\nof which might be to open the door for making all kinds of\ninroads into a great ideal and desideratum like that of\nequality of opportunity. Likewise, we should avoid, in the\nabsence of compelling reason, a course that has the effect\nof unsettling a constitutional position, which has been\nsettled over a long-term of years by a series of decisions.\n\n The liberal approach that may sometimes have been\nadopted in upholding classification under \narticle 14\n would\nin the very nature of things be not apt in the context of\n\narticle 16\n when we keep in view the object underlying\n\narticle 16.\n \nArticle 14\n covers a very wide and general field\nof equality before the law and the equal protection of the\nlaws. It is, therefore, permissible to cover within its\nambit manifold classifications as long as they are\nreasonable and have a rational connection with the object\nthereof. As against that, \narticle 16\n operates in the limited\narea of equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment to an office under the\nState. Carving out classes of citizens for favoured\ntreatment in matters of public employment, except in cases\nfor which there is an express provision contained in clause\n(4) of \narticle 16\n, would as already pointed out above in the\nvery nature of things run counter to the concept underlying\nclause (1) of \narticle 16.\n\n The matter can also be looked at from another angle. If\nit was permissible to accord favoured treatment to members\nof backward classes under clause (1) of \narticle 16\n, there\nwould have been no necessity of inserting clause (4) in\n\narticle 16.\n Clause (4) in \narticle 16\n in such an event would\nhave to be treated as wholly superfuous and redundant. The\nnormal rule of interpretation is that no provision of the\nConstitution is to be treated as redundant and superfuous.\nThe Court would, therefore, be reluctant to accept a view\nwhich would have the effect of rendering clause (4) of\n\narticle 16\n redundant and superfuous.\n\n This Court in the case of State of Madras v. Shrimati\nChampakkam Dorairajan(1) unequivocally repelled the argument\nthe effect of which would have been to treat clause (4) of\n\narticle 16\n to be wholly unnecessary and redundant. Question\nwhich arose for consideration in that case was whether a\nCommunal G.O. fixing percentage of seats for different\nsections of population for admission in the engineering and\nmedical colleges of the State of Madras contravened the\nfundamental rights. It was held that the Communal G.O. by\nwhich percentage of seats was apportioned contravened\n\narticle 29(2)\n of the Constitution. A seven-Judge Bench of\nthis Court in that case referred to clause (4) of \narticle 16\n\nof the Constitution and observed:\n\n \"If the argument founded on \narticle 46\n were sound\n then clause (4) of \narticle 16\n would have been wholly\n unnecessary\n\n945\n\n and redundant. Seeing, however, that clause (4) was\n inserted in \narticle 16\n, the omission of such an express\n provision from \narticle 29\n cannot but be regarded as\n significant. It may well be that the intention of the\n Constitution was not to introduce at all communal\n considerations in matters of admission into any\n educational institution maintained by the State or\n receiving aid out of State funds. The protection of\n backward classes of citizens may require appointment of\n members of backward classes in State services and the\n reason why power has been given to the State to provide\n for reservation of such appointments for backward\n classes may under those circumstances be understood.\n That consideration, however, was not obviously\n considered necessary in the case of admission into an\n educational institution and that may well be the reason\n for the omission from \narticle 29\n of a clause similar to\n clause (4) of \narticle 16.\"\n\nAfter the above decision of this Court, clause (4) of\n\narticle 15\n was added in the Constitution by the \nConstitution\n(First Amendment) Act, 1951\n and the same reads as under:\n\n \"Nothing in this article or in clause (2) of\n \narticle 29\n shall prevent the State from making any\n special provision for the advancement of any socially\n and educationally backward classes of citizens or for\n the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.\"\n\n \nIf the power of reservation of seats for backward\nclasses was already contained in clause (1) of \narticle 15\n,\nthe decision in the above mentioned case would in the very\nnature of things have been different and there would have\nbeen no necessity for the introduction of clause (4) in\n\narticle 15\n by means of the \nConstitution (First Amendment)\nAct\n. The fact that clause (4) of \narticle 15\n is similar to\nclause (4) of \narticle 16\n was also emphasised by this Court\nin the case of \nM. R. Balaji & Ors. v. State of Mysore\n(1).\n\n It has been argued that there are observations in the\ncase of Champakam (supra) relating to the Directive\nPrinciples of State Policy which should be deemed to have\nbeen overruled by the decision of this Court in the case of\nKesavananda Bharati(2). It is, in our opinion, not necessary\nto express an opinion on this aspect. Whatever view one may\ntake with regard to those observations, they would not\ndetract from the correctness of the unanimous decision of\nthe seven-Judge Bench of this Court in that case that, in\nthe absence of provision like clause (4) of \narticle 15\n, it\nwas not permissible to make reservation of seats for\nadmission to engineering and medical colleges on the ground\nof backwardness.\n\n The matter can also be looked at from another angle.\nDepartmental tests are prescribed to ensure standards of\nefficiency for the employees. To promote 34 out of 51\npersons although they have not\n\n946\n\npassed the departmental tests and at the same time not to\npromote those who have passed the departmental tests can\nhardly be conducive to efficiency. There does not,\ntherefore, appear to be any infirmity in the finding of the\nHigh Court that the impugned promotions are also violative\nof \narticle 335\n of the Constitution.\n\n \nI may state that there is no dispute so far as the\nquestion is concerned about the need to make every effort to\nameliorate the lot of backward classes, including the\nmembers of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes. We\nare all agreed on that. The backwardness of those sections\nof population is a stigma on our social set up and has got\nto be erased as visualized in \narticle 46\n of the\nConstitution. It may also call for concrete acts to atone\nfor the past neglect and exploitation of those classes with\na view to bring them on a footing of equality, real and\neffective, with the advanced sections of the population. The\nquestion with which we are concerned, however, is whether\nthe method which has been adopted by the appellants is\nconstitutionally permissible under clause (1) of \narticle 16.\n\nThe answer to the above question, in my opinion, has to be\nin the negative. Apart from the fact that the acceptance of\nthe appellants' contention would result in undermining the\nprinciple of equality of opportunity enshrined in clause (1)\nof \narticle 16\n, it would also in effect entail overruling of\nthe view which has so far been held by this Court in the\ncases of \nChampakam, Rangachari and Devadasan\n (supra). It\nfind no sufficient ground to warrant such a course. The\nState, in my opinion, has ample power to make provision for\nsafeguarding the interest of backward classes under clause\n(4) of \narticle 16\n which deals with reservation of\nappointments or posts for backward classes not adequately\nrepresented in the services under the State. Inaction on the\npart of the State under clause (4) of \narticle 16\n cannot in\nmy opinion, justify strained construction of clause (1) of\n\narticle 16.\n We have also to guard against allowing our\nsupposed zeal to safeguard the interests of members of\nscheduled castes and scheduled tribes to so sway our mind\nand warp our judgment that we drain off the substance of the\ncontents of clause (1) of \narticle 16\n and whittle down the\nprinciple of equality of opportunity in the matter of public\nemployment enshrined in that clause in such a way as to make\nit a mere pious wish and teasing illusion. The ideals of\nsupremacy of merit, the efficiency of services and the\nabsence of discrimination in sphere of public employment\nwould be the obvious casualties if we once countenance\ninroads to be made into that valued principle beyond those\nwarranted by clause (4) of \narticle 16.\n\n The appeal is dismissed with costs.\n\n MATHEW, J.-The facts of the case have been stated in\nthe judgment of the learned Chief Justice and it is not\nnecessary to repeat them. The point which arises for\nconsideration is whether rule 13AA made by Ex. P-1 amendment\nto the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958,\nand Exhibits P-2 and P-6 the orders passed by government in\nthe exercise of their power under that rule, were valid. The\nrule reads:\n\n947\n\n \"13AA. Notwithstanding anything contained in these\n rules, the Government may, by order exempt for a\n specified period, any member or members, belonging to a\n Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, and already in\n service, from passing the test referred to in Rule 13\n or Rule 13A of the said Rules.\"\n\n Rule 13AA came into force on 13-1-1972 and on the same\nday Ex. P-2 Order was passed granting temporary exemption to\nmembers already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes from passing any of two the\ntests (unified and special or departmental tests) for a\nperiod of two years. Thereafter another order was passed\n(Ex. P-6) on 11-1-1974 granting exemption for a period of\nanother two years.\n\n \nThe High Court was of the view that rule 13AA violated\n\nArticle 16(1)\n and that \nArticle 16(4)\n which provides for\nmaking reservation of appointments or posts in favour of\nbackward classes of citizens which, in the opinion of the\nState, is not adequately represented in the service under\nthe State has no application. The Court relied on the\ndecision of this Court in \nGeneral Manager, Southern Railway\nv. Rangachari\n(1) where it was held that \nArticle 16(4)\n is an\nexception to \nArticle 16(1)\n and that it does not take in all\nthe matters covered by \nArticle 16(1)\n as it is concerned only\nwith reservation of appointments and posts in favour of\nbackward classes and that but for \nArticle 16(4)\n there could\nbe no reservation of posts in favour of backward classes\nunder the guarantee of equality of opportunity in the matter\nof employment.\n\n The learned Advocate General of Kerala submitted that\nthe Constitution has enjoined a favoured treatment to the\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes by \nArticle\n46\n and that rule 13AA which empowers the government to\nexempt for a specified period any member or members of the\nScheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes already in service from\npassing the tests referred to in Rules 13 and 13A of the\nRules is only a law passed by the 'State' in pursuance to\nits fundamental obligation to advance the interest of the\nweakest section of the community. He said that the\nimplementation of the directive in \nArticle 46\n will not be\ninconsistent in any manner with the principle of equality of\nopportunity guaranteed under \nArticle 16(1)\n and that a rule\nwhich dispenses with the passing of a test or tests for a\nspecified period in the case of members of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes will not in any way run counter to the\nequality of opportunity guaranteed to the other sections of\nthe community. \nArticle 46\n provides:\n\n \"46. The State shall promote with special care the\n educational and economic interests of the weaker\n sections of the people and, in particular, of the\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall\n protect them from social injustice and all forms of\n exploitation.\"\n\n Justice Brandeis has said the knowledge must precede\nunderstanding and that understanding must precede judgment.\nIt will therefore be in the interest of clarity of thought\nto begin with an understanding\n\n948\n\nof just what equality of opportunity means. \nArticle 16(1)\n\nprovides for equality of opportunity for all citizens in the\nmatter of employment and there can be no doubt that the\nequality guaranteed is an individual right. The concept of\nequality of opportunity is an aspect of the more\ncomprehensive notion of equality. The idea of equality has\ndifferent shades of meaning and connotations. It has many\nfacets and implications. Plato's remark about law is equally\napplicable to the concept of equality: \"a perfectly simple\nprinciple can never be applied to a state of things which is\nthe reverse of simple.(1)\" Different writers tend to\nemphasize some forms of equality rather than others as of\noverriding importance- equality before the law, equality of\nbasic human rights, economic equality, equality of\nopportunity or equality of consideration for all persons.\n\n Formal equality is achieved by treating all persons\nequally: \"Each man to count for one and no one to count for\nmore than one.\" But men are not equal in all respects. The\nclaim for equality is in fact a protest against unjust,\nundeserved and unjustified inequalities. It is a symbol of\nman's revolt against chance, fortuitous disparity, unjust\npower and crystallised privileges. Although the decision to\ngrant equality is motivated prima facie by the alleged\nreason that all men are equal yet, as soon as we clear up\nthe confusion between equality in the moral sense and\nequality in the physical sense, we realise that the opposite\nis the truth; for, we think that it is just to promote\ncertain equalities precisely to compensate for the fact that\nmen are actually born different. We, therefore, have to\nresort to some sort of proportionate equality in many\nspheres to achieve justice.\n\n The principle of proportional equality is attained only\nwhen equals are trated equally and unequals unequally. This\nwould raise the baffling question. Equals and unequals in\nwhat ? The principle of proportional equality therefore\ninvolves an appeal to some criterion in terms of which\ndifferential treatment is justified. If there is no\nsignificant respect in which persons concerned are\ndistinguishable, differential treatment would be\nunjustified. But what is to be allowed as a significant\ndifference such as would justify differential treatment?\n\n In distributing the office of a state, not any sort of\npersonal equality is relevant; for, unless we employ\ncriteria appropriate to the sphere in question, it would\nturn out that a man's height or complexion could determine\nhis eligibility or suitability for a post. As Aristotle\nsaid, claims to political office cannot be based on prowess\nin athletic contests. Candidates for office should possess\nthose qualities that go to make up an effective use of the\noffice. But this principle also does not give any\nsatisfactory answer to the question when differential\ntreatment can be meted out. As I said, the principle that if\ntwo persons are being treated or are to be treated\ndifferently there should be some relevant difference between\nthem is, no doubt, unexceptionable. Otherwise, in the\nabsence of some differentiating feature what is sauce for\nthe goose is sauce for the gander. The real difficulty\narises in finding out what constitutes a relevant\ndifference.\n\n949\n\n If we are all to be treated in the same manner, this\nmust carry with it the important requirement that none of us\nshould be better or worse in up bringing, education, than\nany one else which is an unattainable ideal for human beings\nof anything like the sort we now see. Some people maintain\nthat the concept of equality of opportunity is an\nunsatisfactory concept. For, a complete formulation of it\nrenders it incompatible with any form of human society. Take\nfor instance, the case of equality of opportunity for\neducation. This equality cannot start in schools and hence\nrequires uniform treatment in families which is an evident\nimpossibility. To remedy this, all children might be brought\nup in state nurseries, but, to achieve the purpose, the\nnurseries would have to be run on vigorously uniform lines.\nCould we guarantee equality of opportunity to the young even\nin those circumstances ? The idea is well expressed by\nLaski:\n\n \"Equality means, in the second place, that\n adequate opportunities are laid open to all. By\n adequate opportunities we cannot imply equal\n opportunities in a sense that implies identity of\n original chance. The native endowments of men are by no\n means equal. Children who are brought up in an\n atmosphere where things of the mind are accounted\n highly are bound to start the race of life with\n advantages no legislation can secure. Parental\n character will inevitably affect profoundly the quality\n of the children whom it touches. So long, therefore, as\n the family endures-and there seems little reason to\n anticipate or to desire its disappearance-the varying\n environments it will create make the notion of equal\n opportunities a fantastic one.\"(1)\n Though complete inentity of equality of opportunity is\nimpossible in this world, measures compensatory in character\nand which are calculated to mitigate surmountable obstacles\nto ensure equality of opportunity can never incur the wrath\nof \nArticle 16(1).\n\n The notion of equality of opportunity is a notion that\na limited good shall in fact be allocated on the grounds\nwhich do not a priori exclude any section of those that\ndesire it(2). All sections of people desire and claim\nrepresentation in the public service of the country, but the\navailable number of posts are limited and therefore, even\nthough all sections of people might desire to get posts, it\nis practically impossible to satisfy the desire. The\nquestion therefore is: On what basis can any citizen or\nclass of citizens be excluded from his or their fair share\nof representation? \nArticle 335\n postulates that members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have a claim to\nrepresentation in the public service both of the Union and\nthe States and that the claim has to be taken into\nconsideration consistently with the maintenance of\nefficiency of administration in the making of appointments\nto services of the Union and the States. As I said, the\nnotion\n\n950\n\nof equality of opportunity has meaning only when a limited\ngood or, in the present context, a limited number of posts,\nshould be allocated on grounds which do not a priori exclude\nany section of citizens of those that desire it.\n\n What, then, is a priori exclusion ? It means exclusion\non grounds other than those appropriate or rational for the\ngood (posts) in question. The notion requires not merely\nthat there should be no exclusion from access on grounds\nother than those appropriate or rational for the good in\nquestion, but the grounds considered appropriate for the\ngood should themselves be such that people from all sections\nof society have an equal chance of satisfying them.\n\n Bernard A. O. Williams, in his article \"The Idea of\nEquality\" (supra) gives an illustration of the working of\nthe principle of equality of opportunity:\n\n \"Suppose that in a certain society great prestige\n is attached to membership of a warrior class, the\n duties of which require great physical strength. This\n class has in the past been recruited from certain\n wealthy families only; but egalitarian reformers\n achieve a change in the rules, by which warriors are\n recruited from all sections of the society, on the\n result of a suitable competition. The effect of this,\n however, is that the wealthy families still provide\n virtually all the warriors, because the rest of the\n populace is so undernourished by reason of poverty that\n their physical strength is inferior to that of the\n wealthy and well nourished. The reformers protest that\n equality of opportunity has not really been achieved;\n the wealthy reply that in fact it has, and that the\n poor now have the opportunity of becoming warriors- -it\n is just bad luck that their characteristics are such\n that they do not pass the test. \"We are not\", they\n might say, \"excluding anyone for being poor; we exclude\n people for being weak, and it is unfortunate that those\n who are poor are also weak.\"\n\n This is not a satisfactory answer though it may sound\nlogical. The supposed equality of opportunity is quite\nempty. One knows that there is a causal connection between\nbeing poor and being under-nourished and between being\nunder-nourished and being physically weak. One supposes\nfurther that something should be done subject to whatever\neconomic conditions obtain in the society to alter the\ndistribution of wealth. All this being so, the appeal by the\nwealthy to bad luck of the poor must appear rather\ndisingenuous.\n\n It is clear that one is not really offering equality of\nopportunity to X and Y if one contents oneself with applying\nthe same criteria to X and Y. What one is doing there is to\napply the same criteria to X as affected by favourable\nconditions and to Y as affected by unfavourable but curable\nconditions. Here there is a necessary pressure to equal up\nthe conditions. To give X and Y equality of opportunity\ninvolves regarding their conditions, where curable, as\n\n951\n\nthemselves part of what is done to X and Y and not part of X\nand Y themselves. Their identity for this purpose does not\ninclude their curable environment, which is itself unequal\nand a contributor of inequality [see Williams, \"The Idea of\nEquality\" (supra)].\n\n \nIn Ahmedabad St. Xavier's \nCollege Society and Another\nv. The State of Gujarat and Another\n(1), in the judgment on\nbehalf of Chandrachud, J. and myself, I said at p. 798:\n\n \"The problem of the minorities is not really a\n problem of the establishment of equality because, if\n taken literally, such equality would mean absolute\n identical treatment of both the minorities and the\n majorities. This would result only in equality in law\n but inequality in fact\"\n\nand that\n \"It is obvious that equality in law precludes\n discrimination of any kind; whereas equality in fact\n may involve the necessity of differential treatment in\n order to attain a result which establishes an\n equilibrium between different situations.\"\n It would follow that if we want to give equality of\nopportunity for employment to the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes, we will have to take note of\ntheir social, educational and economic environment. Not only\nis the directive principle embodied in \nArticle 46\n binding on\nthe law-maker as ordinarily understood but it should equally\ninform and illuminate the approach of the Court when it\nmakes a decision as the Court also is 'state' within the\nmeaning of \nArticle 12\n and makes law even though\n\"interstitially from the molar to the molecular\". I have\nexplained at some length the reason why Court is 'state'\nunder \nArticle 12\n in my judgment in \nHis Holiness Kesavananda\nBharati Sripadagalavaru v. State of Kerala and Another\n, etc.\n(2).\n\n Equality of opportunity is not simply a matter of legal\nequality. Its existence depends, not merely on the absence\nof disabilities, but on the presence of abilities. It\nobtains in so far as, and only in so far as, each member of\na community, whatever his birth or occupation or social\nposition, possesses in fact, and not merely in form, equal\nchances of using to the full his natural endowments of\nphysique, of character, and of intelligence(3).\n\n The guarantee of equality before the law or the equal\nopportunity in matters of employment is a guarantee of\nsomething more than what is required by formal equality. It\nimplies differential treatment of persons who are unequal.\nEgalitarian principle has therefore enhanced the growing\nbelief that government has an affirmative duty to eliminate\ninequalities and to provide opportunities for the exercise\nof human rights and claims. Fundamental rights as enacted in\nPart III of the Constitution are, by and large, essentially\nnegative in character.\n\n952\n\nThey mark off a world in which the government should have no\njurisdiction. In this realm, it was assumed that a citizen\nhas no claim upon government except to be let alone. But the\nlanguage of \nArticle 16(1)\n is in marked contrast with that of\n\nArticle 14.\n Whereas the accent in \nArticle 14\n is on the\ninjunction that the State shall not deny to any person\nequality before the law or the equal protection of the laws,\nthat is, on the negative character of the duty of the State,\nthe emphasis in \nArticle 16(1)\n is on the mandatory aspect,\nnamely, that there shall be equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to\nany office under the State implying thereby that affirmative\naction by Government would be consistent with the Article if\nit is calculated to achieve it. If we are to achieve\nequality, we can never afford to relax. \"While inequality is\neasy since it demands no more than to float with the\ncurrent, equality is difficult for it involves swimming\nagainst it. (1)\".\n\n Today, the political theory which acknowledges the\nobligation of government under Part IV of the Constitution\nto provide jobs, medical care, old age pension, etc. extends\nto human rights and imposes an affirmative obligation to\npromote equality and liberty. The force of the idea of a\nstate with obligation to help the weaker sections of its\nmembers seems to have increasing infuence in constitutional\nlaw. The idea finds expression in a number of cases in\nAmerica involving racial discrimination and also in the\ndecisions requiring the state to offset the effects of\npoverty by providing counsel, transcript of appeal, expert\nwitnesses, etc. Today the sense that government has\naffirmative responsibility for elimination of inequalities,\nsocial, economic or otherwise, is one of the dominant forms\nin constitutional law. While special concessions for the\nunderprivileged have been easily permitted, they have not\ntraditionally been required. Decisions in the areas of\ncriminal procedure, voting rights and education in America\nsuggest that the traditional approach may not be completely\nadequate. In these areas, the inquiry whether equality has\nbeen achieved no longer ends with numerical equality; rather\nthe equality clause has been held to require resort to a\nstandard of proportional equality which requires the state,\nin framing legislation, to take into account the private in\nequalities of wealth, of education and other\ncircumstances(2).\n\n The idea of compensatory state action to make people\nwho are really unequal in their wealth, education or social\nenvironment, equal, in specified areas, was developed by the\nSupreme Court of the United States. Rousseau has said: \"It\nis precisely because the force of circumstances tends to\ndestroy equality that force of legislation must always tend\nto maintain it (3).\"\n\n953\n\n In Griffin v. Illinois(1), an indigent defendant was\nunable to take advantage of the one appeal of right granted\nby Illinois law because he could not afford to buy the\nnecessary transcript. Such transcripts were made available\nto all defendants on payment or a similar fee; but in\npractice only non-indigents were able to purchase the\ntranscript and take the appeal. The Court said that \"there\ncan be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets\ndepends on the amount of money he has\" and held that the\nIllinois procedure violated the equal protection clause. The\nstate did not have to make appellate review available at\nall; but if it did, it could not do so in a way which\noperated to deny access to review to defendants solely\nbecause of their indigency. A similar theory underlies the\nrequirement that counsel be provided for indigents on\nappeal. In Douglas v. California(2), the case involved the\nCalifornia procedure which guaranteed one appeal of right\nfor criminal defendants convicted at trial. In the case of\nindigents the appellate court checked over the record to see\nwhether it would be of advantage to the defendant or helpful\nto the appellate court to have counsel appointed for the\nappeal. A negative answer meant that the indigent had to\nappeal pro se if at all. The Court held that this procedure\ndenied defendant the equal protection of the laws. Even\nthough the state was pursuing an otherwise legitimate\nobjective of providing counsel only for non-frivolous\nclaims, it had created a situation in which the well-to-do\ncould always have a lawyer-even for frivolous appeals-\nwhereas the indigent could not.\n\n Justice Harlan, dissenting in both Griffin and Douglas\ncases (supra) said that they represented a new departure\nfrom the traditional view that numerically equal treatment\ncannot violate the equal protection clause. He concluded\nthat the effect of the decisions was to require state\ndiscrimination. He said:\n\n \"The Court thus holds that, at least in this area\n of criminal appeals, the Equal Protection Clause\n imposes on the States an affirmative duty to lift the\n handicaps flowing from differences in economic\n circumstances. That holding produces the anomalous\n result that a constitutional admonition to the States\n to treat all persons equally means in this instance\n that Illinois must give to some that it requires others\n to pay for....It may accurately be said that the real\n issue in this case is not whether Illinois has\n discriminated but whether it has a duty to\n discriminate.\"\n\n Though in one sense Justice Harlan is correct, when one\ncomes to think of the real effect of his view, one is\ninclined to think that the opinion failed to recognise that\nthere are several ways of looking at equality, and treating\npeople equally in one respect always results in unequal\ntreatment in some other respects. For Mr. Justice Harlan,\nthe only type of equality that mattered was numerical\nequality in the terms upon which transcripts were offered to\ndefendants. The maiority, on the other hand, took a view\nwhich would bring about equality\n\n954\n\nin fact, requiring similar availability to all of criminal\nappeals in Griffin's case and counsel-attended criminal\nappeals in Douglas' case. To achieve this result, the\nlegislature had to resort to a proportional standard of\nequality. These cases are remarkable in that they show that\nthe kind of equality which is considered important in the\nparticular context and hence of the respect in which it is\nnecessary to treat people equally(1).\n\n Look at the approach of the Supreme Court of United\nStates of America in Harper v. Virginia Board of\nElections(2). The Court there declared as unconstitution a\nVirginia poll tax of $ 1.50 per person which had been\napplied to all indiscriminately. As in Griffin and Douglas,\nthe state had treated everyone numerically alike with\nrespect to the fee. Whatever discrimination existed was the\nresult of the state's failure to proportion the fee on the\nbasis of need or, what is the same thing, to employ a\nnumerically equal distribution with respect to the vote\nitself. The result again is a requirement that the\nlegislature should take note of difference in private\ncircumstances in formulating its policies.\n\n There is no reason why this Court should not also\nrequire the state to adopt a standard of proportional\nequality which takes account of the differing conditions and\ncircumstances of a class of citizens whenever those\nconclusions and circumstances stand in the way of their\nequal access to the enjoyment of basic rights or claims.\n\n The concept of equality of opportunity in matters of\nemployment is wide enough to include within it compensatory\nmeasures to put the members of the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes on par with the members of other\ncommunities which would enable them to get their share of\nrepresentation in public service. How can any member of the\nso called forward communities complain of a compensatory\nmeasure made by government to ensure the members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes their due share of\nrepresentation in public services ?\n\n It is said that \nArticle 16(4)\n specifically provides for\nreservation of posts in favour of backward classes which\naccording to the decision of this Court would include the\npower of the State to make reservation at the stage of\npromotion also and therefore \nArticle 16(1)\n cannot include\nwithin its compass the power to give any adventitious aids\nby legislation or otherwise to the backward classes which\nwould deregate from strict numerical equality. If\nreservation is necessary either at the initial stage or at\nthe stage of promotion or at both to ensure for the members\nof the Scheduled Castes and Schedu'ed Tribes equality of\nopportunity in the matter of employment. I see no reason why\nthat is not permissible under \nArticle 16(1)\n as that alone\nmight put them on a parity with the forward communities in\nthe matter of achieving the result which equality of\nopportunity would produce. Whether there is equality of\nopportunity can be gauged only by the equality\n\n955\n\nattained in the result. Formal equality of opportunity\nsimply enables people with more education and intelligence\nto capture all the posts and to win over the less fortunate\nin education and talent even when the competition is fair.\nEquality of result is the test of equality of opportunity.\n\n Daniel P. Moynihan, one of America's leading urban\nscholars, spelled out the problem in a widely publicized\nstudy that he prepared while he was Assistant Secretary of\nLabour. The Moynihan Report, as it came to be known, made\nthe point in a passage that deserves full quotation:\n\n \"It is increasingly demanded that the distribution\n of success and failure within one group be roughly\n comparable to that within other groups. It is not\n enough that all individuals start out on even terms, if\n the members of one group almost invariably end up well\n to the fore and those of another far to the rear. This\n is what ethnic politics are all about in America, and\n in the main the Negro American demands are being put\n forth in this new traditional and established\n framework.\n\n \"Here a point of semantics must be grasped. The\n demand for equality of opportunity has been generally\n perceived by White Americans as a demand for liberty, a\n demand not to be excluded from the competitions of\n life- at the polling place, in the scholarship\n examinations, at the personnel office, on the housing\n market. Liberty does, of course, demand that everyone\n be free to try his luck, or test his skill in such\n matters. But those opportunities do not necessarily\n produce equality: On the contrary, to the extent that\n winners imply losers, equality of opportunity almost\n insures inequality of results.\n\n \"The point of semantics is that equality of\n opportunity now has a different meaning for Negroes\n than it has for Whites. It is not (or at least no\n longer) a demand for liberty alone, but also for\n equality-in terms of group results. In Bayard Rustin's\n terms, 'It is now concerned not merely with removing\n the barriers to full opportunity but with achieving the\n fact of equality.' By equality Rustin means a\n distribution of achievements among Negroes roughly\n comparable to that among Whites.\"(1)\n Beginning most notably with the Supreme Court's\ncondemnation of school segregation in 1954, the United\nStates has finally begun to correct the discrepancy between\nits ideals and its treatment of the black man. The first\nsteps, as refected in the decisions of the courts and the\ncivil rights laws of Congress, merely removed the legat and\nquasi-legal forms of racial discrimination. These actions\nwhile not\n\n956\n\nproducing true equality, or even equality of opportunity,\nlogically dictated the next step: positive use of\ngovernment power to create the possibility of a real\nequality. In the words of Professor Lipset: \"Perhaps the\nmost important fact to recognise about the current situation\nof the American Negro is that (legal) equality is not enough\nto insure his movement into larger society.\"(1)\n I agree that \nArticle 16(4)\n is capable of being\ninterpreted as an exception to \nArticle 16(1)\n if the equality\nof opportunity visualized in \nArticle 16(1)\n is a sterile one\ngeared to the concept of numerical equality which takes no\naccount of the social, economic, educational background of\nthe members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. If\nequality of opportunity guaranteed under \nArticle 16(1)\n means\neffective material equality, then \nArticle 16(4)\n is not an\nexception to \nArticle 16(1).\n It is only an emphatic way of\nputting the extent to which equality of opportunity could be\ncarried viz., even upto the point of making reservation.\n\n The State can adopt any measure which would ensure the\nadequate representation in public service of the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and justify it as\na compensatory measure to ensure equality of opportunity\nprovided the measure does not dispense with the acquisition\nof the minimum basic qualification necessary for the\nefficiency of administration.\n\n It does not matter in the least whether the benefit of\nrule 13AA is confined only to those members of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes in service at the time and that\nit is not extended to all members of the backward classes.\nThe law-maker should have liberty to strike the evil where\nit is felt most.\n\n \nArticle 16(1)\n is only a part of a comprehensive scheme\nto ensure equality in all spheres. It is an instance of the\napplication of the larger concept of equality under the law\nembodied in \nArticles 14\n and \n15.\n \nArticle 16(1)\n permits of\nclassification just as \nArticle 14\n does [see \nS. G.\nJaisinghani v. Union of India\n & ors.(\n2), State of Mysore &\nAnr. v. P. Narasing Rao\n(\n3) and C. A. Rajendran v. Union of\nIndia & Ors.\n(4).]. But, by the classification, there can be\nno discrimination on the ground only of race, caste and\nother factors mentioned in \nArticle 16(2).\n\n The word 'caste' in \nArticle 16(2)\n does not include\n'Scheduled Caste'. The definition of 'scheduled castes' in\n\nArticle 366 (24)\n means: \"such castes, races or tribes or\nparts of or groups within such castes, races, or tribes as\nare deemed under \nArticle 341\n to be Scheduled Castes for the\npurposes of this Constitution.\" This shows that it is by\nvirtue of the notification of the President that the\nScheduled\n\n957\n\nCastes come into being. Though the members of the Scheduled\nCastes are drawn from castes, races or tribes, they attain a\nnew status by virtue of the Presidential notification.\nMoreover, though the members of tribe might be included in\nScheduled Castes, tribe as such is not mentioned in \nArticle\n16(2).\n\n A classification is reasonable if it includes all\npersons who are similarly situated with respect to the\npurpose of the law. In other words, the classification must\nbe founded on some reasonable ground which distinguishes\npersons who are grouped together and the ground of\ndistinction must have rational relation to the object sought\nto be achieved by the rule or even the rules in question. It\nis a mistake to assume a priori that there can be no\nclassification within a class, say, the Lower Division\nClerks. If there are intelligible differentia which separate\na group within that class from the rest and that differentia\nhave nexus with the object of classification, I see no\nobjection to a further classification within the class. It\nis no doubt a paradox that though in one sense\nclassification brings about inequality, it is promotive of\nequality if its object is to bring those who share a common\ncharacteristic under a class for differential treatment for\nsufficient and justifiable reasons. \nIn this view, I have no\ndoubt that the principle \nlaid down in\n \nAll-India Station\nMasters' and Assistant Station Masters' Association v.\nGeneral Manager, Central Railway and Others\n(\n1), S. G.\nJaisinghani v. Union of India and Others\n (\nsupra) and State\nof Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa & Ors.\n(2) has no\napplication here.\n\n \nArticle 16(1)\n and \nArticle 16(2)\n do not prohibit the\nprescription of a reasonable qualification for appointment\nor for promotion. Any provision as to qualification for\nemployment or appointment to an office reasonably fixed and\napplicable to all would be consistent with the doctrine of\nequality of opportunity under \nArticle 16(1) [\nsee \nThe General\nManager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n(3)].\n\n Rule 13 provides that no person shall be eligible for\nappointment to any service unless he possesses the special\nqualification and has passed such special tests as may be\nprescribed in that behalf by special rules or possesses such\nspecial qualification as he considered to be equivalent to\nthe said special qualification or special tests.\n\n The material provision in rule 13A provides that\nnotwithstanding anything contained in rule 13, where a pass\nin a special or departmental test is newly prescribed by the\nSpecial Rules of a service for any category, grade or post\ntherein or in any class thereof, a member of a service who\nhas not passed the said test but is otherwise qualified and\nsuitable for appointment to such class, category, grade or\npost may within two years of the introduction of the test be\nappointed thereto temporarily.\n\n958\n\n Rule 14 provides for reservation of appointments to\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\n Rule 13AA has been enacted not with the idea of\ndispensing with the minimum qualification required for\npromotion to a higher category or class, but only to give\nenough breathing space to enable the members of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes to acquire it. The purpose of\nthe classification made in rule 13AA viz., of putting the\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in one\nclass and giving them an extension of time for acquiring the\ntest qualification prescribed by rule 13 and rule 13A is to\nenable them to have their due claim of representation in the\nhigher category without sacrificing the efficiency implicit\nin the passing of the test. That the passing of some of\nthese tests does not spell in the realm of minimum basic\nrequirement of efficiency is clear from rule 13A. That rule,\nat any rate, contemplated passing of the test by all the\nemployees within two years of its introduction showing\nthereby that acquisition of the test qualification was not a\nsine qua non for holding the posts. Rule 13(b) which\nprovides for exemption from passing the test would also\nindicate that passing of the test is not absolutely\nessential for holding the post. The classification made in\nrule 13AA has a reasonable nexus with the purpose of the\nlaw, namely, to enable the members of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes to get their due share of promotion to the\nhigher grade in the service without impairing the efficiency\nof administration. Rule 13AA is not intended to give\npermanent exemption to the members of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes from passing the test but only reasonable\ntime to enable them to do so. The power to grant exemption\nunder the rule, like every other power, is liable to be\nabused. If the power is abused and the members of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are given favoured\ntreatment to the extent not warranted by their legitimate\nclaim, the courts are not rendered helpless. That the power\nis liable to be abused is no reason to hold that the rule\nitself viz., rule 13AA, is bad.\n\n The ultimate reason for the demand of equality for the\nmembers of backward classes is a moral perspective which\naffirms the intrinsic value of all human beings and call for\na society which provides those conditions of life which men\nneed for development of their varying capacities. It is an\nassertion of human equality in the sense that it manifests\nan equal concern for the well being of all men. On the one\nhand it involves a demand for the removal of those obstacles\nand impediments which stand in the way of the development of\nhuman capacities-that is it is a call for the abolition of\nunjustifiable inequalities. On the other hand, the demand\nitself gets its sense and moral driving force from the\nrecognition that 'the poorest he that is in England hath a\nlife to live, as the greatest he'(1).\n\n959\n\n I agree with the conclusion of my Lord the Chief\nJustice that the appeal should be allowed.\n\n BEG, J : I share the conclusion reached by the learned\nChief Justice and my learned brethren Mathew, Krishna Iyer,\nand Murtaza Fazal Ali. I would, however, like to add, with\ngreat respect, that a view which though not pressed in this\nCourt by the Advocate General of Kerala, perhaps because it\nhad been repelled by the Kerala High Court, seems to me to\nsupply a more satisfying legal justification for the\nbenefits conferred, in the form of an extended period\ngranted to Government employees of a backward class to pass\na qualifying test for promotion to a higher grade of\nservice, that is to say, from that of the Lower Division\nClerks to that of the Upper Division Clerks in the State of\nKerala. I think that we have to, in such a case, necessarily\nconsider whether the manner in which Scheduled Caste and\nScheduled Tribe Government employees are treated by the\nrules and orders under consideration falls within \nArticle\n16(4)\n of the Constitution.\n\n Strictly speaking, the view adopted by my learned\nbrother Khanna, that the ambit of the special protection of\n\"equality of opportunity in matters relating to public\nservice\", which can be made available to members of backward\nclasses of citizens, is exhausted by \nArticle 16(4)\n of the\nConstitution, seems inescapable. \nArticle 16\n is after all, a\nfacet of the grand principles embraced by \nArticle 14\n of our\nConstitution. It guarantees : \"Equality of opportunity in\nmatters of public appointment\". It does so in absolute\nterms. It is a necessary consequence and a special\napplication of \nArticle 14\n in an important field where denial\nof equality of opportunity cannot be permitted. While\n\nArticle 16(1)\n sets out the positive aspect of equality of\nopportunity in matters relating to employment by the State,\n\nArticle 16(2)\n negatively prohibits discrimination on the\ngrounds given in \nArticle 16(2)\n in the area covered by\n\nArticle 16(1)\n of the Constitution. If Scheduled Castes do\nnot fall within the ambit of \nArticle 16(2)\n, but, as a\n\"backward class\" of citizens, escape the direct prohibition\nit is because the provisions of \nArticle 16(4)\n make such an\nescape possible for them. They could also avoid the\nnecessary consequences of the positive mandate of \nArticle\n16(1)\n if they come within the only exception contained in\n\nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution. I respectfully concur\nwith my learned brother Khanna and Gupta that it would be\ndangerous to extend the limits of protection against the\noperation of the principle of equality of opportunity in\nthis field bevond its express constitutional authorisation\nby \nArticle 16(4).\n\n When citizens are already employed in a particular\ngrade, as Government servants, considerations relating to\nthe sources from which they are drawn lose much of their\nimportance. As public servants of that grade they could,\nquite reasonably and logically, be said to belong to one\nclass, atleast for purposes of promotion in public service\nfor which there ought to be a real \"equality of opportunity\"\n\n960\n\nif we are to avoid heart burning or a sense of injustice or\nfrustration in this class. Neither as members of this single\nclass nor for purposes of the equality of opportunity which\nis to be afforded to this class does the fact that some of\nthem are also members of an economically and socially\nbackward class continue to be material, or, strictly\nspeaking, even relevant. Their entry into the same relevant\nclass as others must be deemed to indicate that they no\nlonger suffer from the handicaps of a backward class. For\npurposes of Government service the source from which they\nare drawn should cease to matter. As Government servants\nthey would, strictly speaking, form only one class for\npurposes of promotion.\n\n As has been pointed out by Mylord the Chief Justice,\nthe protection of \nArticle 16(1)\n continues throughout the\nperiod of service. If \nArticle 16(1)\n is only a special facet\nor field, in which an application of the general principles\nof \nArticle 14\n is fully worked out or stated, as it must be\npresumed to be, there is no room left for importing into it\nany other or further considerations from \nArticle 14.\n Again\nthe express provisions of \nArticle 16(4)\n would be presumed to\nexhaust all exceptions made in favour of backward classes\nnot contained there if we apply the maxim expressio unius\nest exclusio alterius\". It is true that the principle of\nreasonable classification may still claim recognition or be\nrelevant for working out the exact significance of \"equality\nof opportunity\" even within \nArticle 16(1)\n in some aspect or\ncontext other than the one indicated by \nArticle 16(4).\n But,\nin view of \nArticle 16(4)\n, that aspect or context must be\ndifferent from one aimed at realizing the objects of\n\nArticles 46\n and \n335\n in the sphere of Government service. The\nspecified and express mode of realization of these objects\ncontained in \nArticle 16(4)\n, must exclude the possibility of\nother methods which could be implied and read into \nArticle\n16(1)\n for securing them in this field. One could think of so\nmany other legally permissible and possibly better, or,\natleast more direct, methods of removing socio-economic\ninequalities by appropriate legislative action in other\nfields left open and unoccupied for purposes of\ndiscrimination in favour of the backward.\n\n In relation to promotions, \"equality of opportunity\"\n\ncould only mean subjection to similar conditions for\npromotion by being subjected uniformly to similar or same\nkind of tests. This guarantee was, in fact, intended to\nprotect the claims of merit and efficiency as against\nincursions of extraneous considerations. The guarantee\ncontained in \nArticle 16(1)\n is not, by itself, aimed at\nremoval of backwardness due to socio-economic and\neducational disparties produced by past history of social\noppression, exploitation, or degradation of a class of\npersons. In fact, efficiency tests, as parts of a mechanism\nto provide equality of opportunity, are meant to bring out\nand measure actually existing inequalities in competence and\ncapacity or potentialities so as to provide a fair and\nrational basis for justifiable discrimination between\ncandidates. Whatever may be the real causes of unequal\nperformances which imposition of tests may disclose, the\npurpose of equality of opportunity by means of tests is only\nto ensure a fair competition in securing posts and\npromotions in Government service, and not the removal of\ncauses for unequal performances in\n\n961\n\ncompetitions for these posts or promotions. Thus, the\npurposes of \nArticles 46\n and \n335\n, which are really extraneous\nto the objects of \nArticle 16(1)\n, can only be served in such\na context by rules which secure preferential treatment for\nthe backward classes and detract from the plain meaning and\nobvious implications of \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n16(2).\n Such\nspecial treatment mitigates the rigour of a strict\napplication of the principle contained in \nArticle 16(1).\n It\nconstitutes a departure from the principle of absolute\nequality of opportunity in the application of uniform tests\nof competence. \nArticle 16(4)\n was designed to reconcile the\nconflicting pulls of \nArticle 16(1)\n, representing the\ndynamics of justice, conceived of as equality in conditions\nunder which candidates actually compete for posts in\nGovernment service, and of \nArticles 46\n and \n335\n, embodying\nthe duties of the State to promote the interests of the\neconomically, educationally, and socially backward so as to\nrelease them from the clutches of social injustice. These\nencroachments on the field of \nArticle 16(1)\n can only be\npermitted to the extent they are warranted by \nArticle 16(4).\n\nTo read broader concepts of social justice and equality into\n\nArticle 16(1)\n itself may stultify this provision itself and\nmake \nArticle 16(4)\n otiose.\n\n Members of a backward class could be said to be\ndiscriminated against if severer tests were prescribed for\nthem. But, this is not the position in the case before us.\nAll promotees, belonging to any class, caste, or creed, are\nequally subjected to efficiency tests of the same type and\nstandard. The impugned rules do not dispense with these\ntests for any class or group. Indeed, such tests could not\nbe dispensed with for employees from Scheduled Castes, even\nas a backward class, keeping in view the provisions of\n\nArticle 335\n of the Constitution. All that happens here is\nthat the backward class of employees is given a longer\nperiod of time to pass the efficiency tests and prove their\nmerit as determined by such tests. It has been, therefore,\nargued that, in this respect, there is substantial equality.\nIn other words, the argument is that if \nArticle 16(1)\n could\nbe interpreted a little less rigidly and more liberally the\ndiscrimination involved here will not fall outside it. Even\nif this was a tenable view. I would, for all the reasons\ngiven here, prefer to find the justification if this is\npossible, in the express provisions of \nArticle 16(4)\n because\nthis is where such a justification should really lie.\n\n In the case before us, it appears that respondent\npetitioner's grievance was that certain members of the\nScheduled Castes, as a backward class, had been given\npreference over him inasmuch as he was not promoted despite\nhaving passed the efficiency test, but certain members of\nthe backward class were allowed to remain in the higher\nposts as temporary promotees, without having passed the\nefficiency tests, because they had been given an extended\nperiod of time to satisfy the qualifying tests. The\npetitioner thus claimed priority on the ground of merit\njudged solely by taking and passing the efficiency test\nearlier. Apparently, he was not even promoted, whereas the\nbackward class employees said to have been given preference\nover him\n\n962\n\nwere, presumably quite satisfactorily, discharging their\nduties in the higher grade in which they were already\nworking as temporary promotees. He also admits that the\nrespondents, over whom he claims preference for promotion,\nwere his seniors in service who had put in longer terms of\ntotal service before their conditional promotions\ntemporarily into the grade of the Upper Division Clerks. It\nseems to me that the taking and passing of a written test\nearlier than another employee could not be the sole factor\nto consider in deciding upon a claim to superiority or to\npreference on grounds of merit and efficiency for promotion\nas a Government servant.\n\n The relevant rule 13A shows that a person who is\nallowed temporarily to work in the cadre of promotees, even\nwithout having passed the special efficiency test, must,\nnevertheless, have satisfied the test of being \"otherwise\nqualified and suitable for appointment\". Thus, an employee\nfrom a Scheduled Caste has also to be \"otherwise qualified\"\n\nbefore he is given an opportunity to work with others\nsimilarly promoted temporarily. The only difference is that,\nwhereas the others get only two years from the introduction\nof the new test within which to qualify according to the\nnewly introduced test, an employee of a Scheduled Caste or a\nScheduled Tribe, similarly placed, gets two more years under\nthe second proviso. The impugned rule 13AA, however, gives\npower to the Government to specify a longer period of\nexemption if it considers this to be necessary. The Governor\npassed the impugned order of 13-1-1972 under rule 13AA,\nextending the period still more. This order and the relevant\nrules 13A and 13AA are already set out above in the judgment\nof Mylord the Chief Justice. I need not, therefore,\nreproduce them here.\n\n What is the effect of the provisions of Rules 13A and\n13AA and the order of 13-1-1972 ? Is it not that a person\nwho is in the position of the respondent petitioner must\nwait for a place occupied by or reserved for a person from a\nScheduled Caste or Tribe, treated as backward class, until\nit is shown that the employee from the backward class has\nfailed to take and pass the new test despite the extended\nperiod given to him. The effect of the relaxation is that\nthe backward class employee continues in the post\ntemporarily for a longer period before being either\nconfirmed or reverted. For this period, the post remains\nreserved for him. If he does not satisfy the efficiency\ntests even within this extended period he has to revert to\nthe lower grade. If he does satisfy the special efficiency\ntest, in this extended period, he is confirmed in the class\nof promotees into which he obtained entry because of a\nreservation. Among meanings of the term \"reserve\", given in\nthe Oxford Dictionary, are \"To keep back or hold over to a\nlater time or place for further treatment; to set apart for\nsome purpose or with some end in view\". In the Webster's New\nInternational Dictionary IInd Edn. (at p. 2118), the\nfollowing meanings are given: \"To keep back; to retain or\nhold over to a future time or place; not to deliver, make\nover or disclose it at once\". The result of the above\nmentioned rules and orders does seem to me to be a kind of\nreservation. If a reservation of posts under Article 16(4)\nfor employees of backward classes could include complete re-\n\n963\n\nservation of higher posts to which they could be promoted,\nabout which there could be no doubt now, I fail to see why\nit cannot be partial or for a part of the duration of\nservice and hedged round with the condition that a temporary\npromotion would operate as a complete and confirmed\npromotion only if the temporary promotee satisfies some\ntests within a given time.\n\n If the impugned rules and orders could be viewed as an\nimplementation of a policy of qualified or partial or\nconditional reservation, in the form indicated above, which\ncould satisfy the requirements of substantial equality, in\nkeeping with \nArticle 335\n, and meet the demands of equity and\njustice looked at from the broader point of view of \nArticle\n46\n of the Constitution, they could, in my view, also be\njustified under \nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution.\n\n \nIt may be that the learned Advocate General for the\nappellant State did not press the ground that the impugned\nrules and orders are governed by \nArticle 16(4)\n because of\nthe tests required for complete or absolute reservation\ndealt with in \nT. Devadasan v. the Union of India & Anr.\n(\n1)\nand M. R. Balajli & Ors. v. State of Mysore\n(2), where it was\nheld that more than 50% reservations for a backward class\nwould violate the requirement of reasonableness inasmuch as\nit would exclude too large a proportion of others. Apart\nfrom the fact that the case before us is distinguishable as\nit is one of only a partial or temporary and conditional\nreservation, it is disputed here that the favoured class of\nemployees really constituted more than fifty per cent of the\ntotal number of Government servants of this class (i.e.\nClerks) if the overall position and picture, by taking the\nnumber of employees in all Govt. Departments, is taken into\naccount. Furthermore, it is pointed out that a large number\nof temporary promotions of backward class Government\nservants of this grade had taken place in 1972 in the\nRegistration Department, in which the petitioning respondent\nworked, because promotions of backward class employees had\nbeen held up in the past due to want of necessary provisions\nin rules which could enable the Government to give effect to\na policy of a sufficient representation of backward class\nemployees of this grade in Government service. The totality\nof facts of this case is distinguish able in their effects\nfrom those in cases cited before us. No case was cited which\ncould fully cover the position we have before us now.\n\n I am not satisfied that the only ground given by the\nHigh Court for refusing to give the benefits of impugned\nrules and orders to the backward class Government servants,\nthat they fall outside the purview of \nArticle 16(4)\n, was\nsubstantiated. It was for the respondent petitioner to\ndischarge the burden of establishing a constitutionally\nunwarranted discrimination against him. His petition ought\nin my opinion, to have been dismissed on the ground that he\nhad failed to discharge this initial burden.\n\n Accordingly, I would allow this appeal and set aside\nthe judgment and order of the High Court and leave the\nparties to bear their own costs throughout.\n\n964\n\n \nKRISHNA IYER, J.-A\n case which turns the focus on the\npolitical philosophy pervading the Constitution and affects\na large human segment submerged below the line of ancient\nsocial penury, naturally prompts me to write a separate\nopinion substantially concurring with that of the learned\nChief Justice. Silence is not always golden.\n\n The highlight of this Civil Appeal against the High\nCourt's judgment striking down a State Subordinate Service\nrule, thereby adversely affecting lower rung officials\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, is\nthe seminal issue of admissibility and criteria of\nclassification within the 'equal opportunity' rule in \nArt.\n16(1)\n and the lethal effect of the built-in inhibition\nagainst caste-based classification contained in Art 16(2) in\nrelation to these frightfully backward categories. In a\nlarge sense, the questions are res integra and important and\ncannot be dismissed easily on the remark of Justice Holmes\nthat the equal protection clause is 'the last resort of\nconstitutional arguments' (274 U.S. 200, 208).\n\n Law, including constitutional law, can no longer 'go it\nalone' but must be illumined in the interpretative process\nby sociology and allied fields of knowledge. Indeed, the\nterm 'constitutional law' symbolizes an intersection of law\nand politics, wherein issues of political power are acted on\nby persons trained in the legal tradition, working in\njudicial institutions, following the procedures of law,\nthinking as lawyers think.(1) So much so, a wider\nperspective is needed to resolve issues of constitutional\nlaw. May be, one cannot agree with the view of an eminent\njurist and former Chief Justice of India: 'the judiciary as\na whole is not interested in the policy underlying a\nlegislative measure' (Mr. Hidayatullah-'Democracy in India\nand Judicial Process'-1965-p. 70). Moreover, the Indian\nConstitution is a great social document, almost\nrevolutionary in its aim of transforming a medieval,\nhierarchical society into a modern, egalitarian democracy.\nIts provisions can be comprehended only by a spacious,\nsocial-science approach, not by pedantic, traditional\nlegalism. Here we are called upon to delimit the amplitude\nand decode the implications of \nArt. 16(1)\n in the context of\ncertain special concessions relating to employment, under\nthe Kerala State (the appellant), given to Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes (for short, hereinafter referred to as\nharijans) whose social lot and economic indigence are an\nIndian reality recognized by many Articles of the\nConstitution. An overview of the decided cases suggests the\nneed to re-interpret the dynamic import of the 'equality\nclauses' and, to stress again, beyond reasonable doubt, that\nthe paramount law, which is organic and regulates our\nnation's growing life, must take in its sweep 'ethics,\neconomics, politics and sociology'. Equally pertinent to the\nissue mooted before us is the lament of Friedman:\n\n \"It would be tragic if the law were so petrified\n as to be unable to respond to the unending challenge of\n evolutionary or revolutionary changes in society.\"(2)\n\n965\n\nThe main assumptions which Friedman makes are:\n\n \"first, the law is, in Holmes' phrase, not a\n 'brooding omnipotence in the sky', but a flexible\n instrument of social order, dependent on the political\n values of the society which it purports to\n regulate....\"(1)\n Naturally surges the interrogation, what are the\nchallenges of changing values to which the guarantee of\nequality must respond and how? To pose the problem with\nparticular reference to our case, does the impugned rule\nviolate the constitutional creed of equal opportunity in\n\nArt. 16\n by resort to a suspect classification or revivify it\nby making the less equal more equal by a legitimate\ndifferentiation ? Chief Justice Marshall's classic statement\nin Mc Culloch v Maryland(2) followed by Justice Brennan in\nKazenbach v. Morgan(3) remains a beacon light:\n \"Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the\n scope of the constitution, and all means which are\n appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end,\n which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter\n and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.\"\n\n The background facts may be briefly set out in the\nelemental form. The Kerala State and Subordinate Services\nRules, 1958 (for short, the rules) regulate the conditions\nof service of the State employees of the lower order. We are\nconcerned with the prescription of qualifications for\npromotion of the lower division clerks to upper division\nposts in the Registration Department. Rule 13 insists on\npassing certain tests for promotional eligibility. When\ntests were newly introduced, r. 13A gave 2 years from their\nintroduction for passing them, to all hands-harijan and non-\nharijan, but the former enjoyed an extra two year grace\nperiod. Rule 13B totally exempted pentagenarians from\npassing these tests. Rule 13AA, which is impugned as\nviolative of \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n of the Constitution, was\npromulgated on January 13, 1972 and it reads:\n\n \"13AA. Notwithstanding anything contained in these\n rules, the Government may, by order, exempt for a\n specified period any member or members, belonging to a\n Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, and already in\n service, from passing the tests referred to in rule 13\n or rule 13A of the said Rules.\n\n Provided that this rule shall not be applicable to\n tests prescribed for purposes of promotion of the\n executive staff below the rank of Sub-Inspectors\n belonging to the Police Department.\"\n\n966\n\nA Note appended to the rule gives the raison d' etre of the\nrule:\n\n \"It has been brought to the notice of Government\n that a large number of Harijan employees in Public\n Service are facing immediate reversion from their posts\n for want of test qualifications. So it is considered\n necessary to incorporate an enabling provision in the\n Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958 to\n grant by order temporary exemption to members already\n in service belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n Tribes from passing all tests for a specified period.\n This notification is intended to achieve the above\n object.\"\n\n A break-up of r. 13AA of the rules certainly gives\npower to Government to extend the time to harijan officials\nof 'subordinate services' for passing tests prescribed for\noccupying promotional posts. But it does not for ever exempt\nthese hands but only waive for a specified, presumably,\nshort term. Nor does it relax the minimal qualifications\nheld necessary for these posts from the point of view of\nbasic administrative efficiency. The subsidiary need of\npassing certain new tests, for which all employees get some\nperiod (from the time of their introduction) is relaxed for\na longer period in the case of harijan hands under r. 13A\nand still more under r. 13AA. We must expect that Government\nwill, while fixing the longer grace time for passing tests,\nhave regard to administrative efficiency. You can't throw to\nthe winds considerations of administrative capability and\ngrind the wheels of Government to a halt in the name of\n'harijan welfare'. The Administration runs for good\ngovernment, not to give jobs to harijans. We must accept the\nnecessary import of the rule as a limited concession to this\nweaker group and test its vires on this basis.\n\n One significant factor must be remembered to guard\nagainst exaggerating the bearing of these tests as a\ncoefficient of efficiency. Certainly, they were not so\nimportant as all that because r. 13A-not challenged all\nthese years-gave 2 years' qualifying period for all and 4\nyears for harijans. Also those above 50 years of age did not\nhave to pass the tests at all (r. 13B). The nature of the\ntests vis a vis the nature of work of upper division clerks,\nand their indispensability for official capability have not\nbeen brought out in the writ petition and, absent such\nserious suggestions, we have to assume that Government (the\nauthor of r.13) would have granted varying periods of\nexemption only because of their desirability, not their\nprecedent necessity. To expatiate a little more, it is not\nunusual to fix basic qualifications for eligibility to a\npost. Their possession is a must, having regard to the\nfunctions of the office. A second and secondary category of\nqualifications is insisted on as useful to discharge the\nduties of the post e.g., accounts test, or civil and\ncriminal judicial tests and the like, depending on the\ndepartment where he is to work. After all here he is a pen-\npushing clerk, not a magistrate, accounts officer, forest\nofficer, sub-registrar, space scientist or too administrator\nor one on whose initiative the wheels of a department speed\nup or slow down. Even so, it makes his clerical work more\nunderstanding and efficient. These\n\n967\n\ntests are, therefore, demanded for better performance, not\nbasic proficiency, but relaxation is also allowed in\nsuitable class of cases, their absence not being fatal to\nefficiency. A third class of virtues which will make the\nemployee ultra efficient, but is not regarded as cardinal,\nis listed as entitled to preference. A doctorate in business\nmanagement, or LL.M. where the basic degree is the essential\nrequisite, social service or leadership training, sports\ndistinction and a host of other extra attainments which will\nimprove the aptitude and equipment of the officer in his\nspeciality but are, in no sense, necessary-these are welcome\nadditives, are good and may even get the employee a salary\nraise but are not insisted on for initial appointment to the\npost either as a direct recruit or as a promotee. This\ntrichotomy of qualifications makes pragmatic meaning to any\nemployer and is within anyone's ken if he turns over the\nadvertisements in newspapers. To relax on basic\nqualifications is to compromise with minimum administrative\nefficiency; to relent, for a time, on additional test\nqualifications is to take a calculated but controlled risk,\nassured of a basic standard of performance; to encourage the\npossession of higher excellence is to upgrade the efficiency\nstatus of the public servant and, eventually of the\ndepartment. This is the sense and essence of the situation\narising in the present case, viewed from the angle of\nadministrative requirements or fair employment criteria.\n\n Back now to the rule of exemption and its vires.\nFrankly, here the respondents who have passed the 'tests'\nare stalled in their promotion because of the new rule of\nharijan exemption. As individuals, their rights vis a vis\ntheir harijan brethren are regarded unequally. In a strictly\ncompetitive context or narrowly performance-oriented\nstandard, r. 13AA discriminates between a harijan and a non-\nharijan. The question is whether a perceptive sensitivity\nsees on 'equal opportunity' a critical distinction between\ndistribution according to 'merit' of individuals and\ndistribution according to 'need' of depressed groups,\nsubject to broad efficiency criteria. We enter here 'a\nconceptual disaster area'.\n\n Factual contexts dictate State action. The differential\nimpact of a law on a class will influence judicial\nevaluation of the reasonableness of a classification and its\nrelation to a purpose which is permissible. Courts, however,\nadopt a policy of restrained review where the situation is\ncomplex and is intertwined with social, historical and other\nsubstantially human factors. Judicial deference-not\nabdication-is best expressed by Justice Holmes in his\ndissent in Louisvilla Gas & Elec. Co. v. Coleman\n \"But when it is seen that a line or a point there\n must be, and that there is no mathematical and logical\n way of fixing it precisely, the decision of the\n legislature must be accepted unless we can say that it\n is very wide of any reasonable mark.\"\n\n968\n\nIn Buck v. Bell Holmes J. observed:\n\n \"The law does all that is needed when it does all\n that it can, indicates a policy, applies it to all\n within the lines, and seeks to bring within the lines\n all similarly situated so far and so fast as its means\n allow\".\n\nGiven a legitimate over-riding purpose for selectivity the\nCourt passes, leaving it to the law-maker the intricate\nmanner of implementation. Faced with a suspect\nclassification based on a quasi-caste differentia and\napparently injuring administrative quality, the Court turns\nactivist. Conceptual equilibrium between these two lines is\nthe correct guideline.\n\n The operational technique may vary with time and\ncircumstance but the goal and ambit must be constitutionally\nsanctioned. In the instant case, the State has taken a\ncertain step to advance the economic interests of harijans.\nWhat-if we break down the rule into its components-have\nGovernment done ? Have they transgressed the rights under\n\nArt. 16(1)\n \n& (2) ?\n If they have, the Court, as\nconstitutional invigorator interdicts, after making\npermissible presumptions in favour of State actions and\nimporting the liberal spirit of effective equality into the\nmandate of Arts. 14 and 16. Otherwise, the hammer does not\nfall.\n\n Why was this second 'holiday' under rule 13AA to\nharijans granted ? The hapless circumstance which compelled\nthis course was, according to the State, the need to help\nthis class, acting within the constitutional bounds, to\navert mass reversion to lower posts, without abandoning\ninsistence on passing 'tests'. The Note to r. 13AA is\nexplanatory. The State viewed this disturbing situation with\nconcern, and, having regard to their backward condition,\nmade r. 13AA which conferred power on Government to grant\nfurther spells of grace time to get through these tests.\nSimultaneously, a period within which two opportunities for\npassing tests would be available was afforded by a G.O.\nissued under r. 13AA. The consequence was their immediate\nreversion was averted and the promotion prospects of the\nnon-harijan writ petitioners, who were test-qualified, stood\npostponed. This grievance of theirs drove them to the High\nCourt where the rule of temporary exemption from passing\ntests for promotional eligibility in favour of harijans was\nheld ultra vires Arts. 16(1) and 335.\n\n I shall focus on the basis because my learned brethren\nhave dilated on the necessary details of facts and, more\nimportantly, because confusion on fundamentals deflects the\nconstruction of constitutional clauses-all this against the\nadmitted backdrop of die-hard harijan bondage, sometimes\nsubtle, sometimes gross. The learned Advocate General fairly\nconceded-and I think rightly-that r. 13AA was not a\n'reservation' under \nArt. 16(4)\n and yet the favoured\ntreatment to harijan clerks was valid, being based on\nreasonable classification under a constitutionally\nrecognised differentia which had a relation to the legi-\n\n969\n\ntimate end of promoting the advancement of this handicapped\nclass, subject to administrative efficiency. The learned\nSolicitor General, appearing on notice by the Court to the\nAttorney General, stated the law on a broader basis and\nurged that the grouping of classes of socially and\neducationally downtrodden people especially the Scheduled\nCastes and Tribes, was good and did not offend \nArt. 16(1)\n or\n(2). Shri R. K. Garg, for some of the respondents and for\nthe interveners, spread out the social canvas, focussed on\nthe age-old suppression and consequential utter backwardness\nof those societal brackets and the State's obligation to\nwipe out the centuries of deprivation by making a concerted\neffort to bring them up to the same level as the other\nclasses so that, after this levelling up, the whole nation\ncould march forward on terms of democratic equality.\nDiscrimination on the ground of caste did not arise,\naccording to counsel, Scheduled Castes and Tribes being not\na caste but an amalgam of the socially lowly and the lost,\nincluding groups with a caste savour. Shri Krishnamoorthy\nIyer, for the respondents, naturally disputed all these\npropositions. The cornerstone of his case was that in the\nfield of State employment caste-wise compassion to harijans\nflew in the face of \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n and separate but\nspecial treatment was permissible only under \nArt. 16(4)\n\nwhich was expressly designed as benignant discrimination\ndevoted to lifting backward classes to the level of the rest\nthrough the constitutional technology of 'reservation'. To\ntravel beyond this special clause and evolve a general\ndoctrine of backward classification was to over-power the\nbasic concept of equality and to bring in, by a specious\ndevice, a back-door casteism subverting the scheme of a\ncasteless society set as one of the goals of our\nconstitutional order. Efficiency of administration, an\nimportant desideratum of public service, would also suffer.\n\n I will examine these contentions in depth and detail\nlater in this judgment.\n\n Let us proceed to assess the constitutional merit of\nthe State's ex facie 'unequal' service rule favouring in-\nservice harijan employees in a realist socio-legal\nperspective. But before that, some memorable facts must be\nstated. The Father of the National adopted, as his fighting\nfaith, the uplift of the bhangi and his assimilation, on\nequal footing, into Hindu society, and the Constitution,\nwhose principal architect was himself a militant mahar, made\nsocial justice a founding faith and built into it humanist\nprovisions to lift the level of the lowly scheduled castes\nand tribes to make democracy viable and equal for all.\nStudies in social anthropology tell us how cultural and\nmaterial suppression has, over the ages, crippled their\npersonality, and current demography says that nearly every\nfifth Indian is a harijan and his social milieu is steeped\nin squalour. The conscience of the Constitution found\nadequate expression on this theme, in Dr. Ambedkar's words\nof caution and premonition in the Constituent Assembly:\n\n \"We must begin by acknowledging first that there\n is complete absence of two things in Indian society.\n One of\n\n970\n\n these is equality. On the social plane, we have in\n India a society based on privilege of graded inequality\n which means elevation for some and degradation of\n others. On the economic plane, we have a society in\n which there are some who have immense wealth as against\n the many who are living in abject poverty. On the 26th\n of January, 1950, we are going to enter into a life of\n contradictions. In politics we will have equality and\n in social and economic life we will have inequality...\n We must remove this contradiction at the earliest\n possible moment, or else those who suffer from\n inequality will blow up the structure of political\n democracy which this Assembly has so laboriously built\n up.\"\n\n (Speeches, Vol. II, pp. 184-187).\n\nJudges may differ in constitutional construction but,\nwithout peril of distorting the substance, cannot discard\nthe activism of the equal justice concept in the setting of\ndeep concern for the weaker sections of the community. What\nI endeavour to emphasize, as I will elaborate later, is that\nequal justice is an aspect of social justice, the salvation\nof the very weak and down-trodden, and the methodology for\nlevelling them up to a real, not formal, equality, being the\naccent.\n\n The Kerala State, the appellant, has statistically\nshown the yawning gap between what number of posts in\nGovernment service harijans are entitled to, population-\nratio wise, and the actual number of posts occupied by them.\nTheir 'official' fate is no less ominous elsewhere in India\nand would have been poorer on the competitive market method\nof selection unaided by 'reservation'. The case for social\nequality and economic balance, in terms of employment under\nthe State, cries for more energised administrative effort\nand a Government that fails to repair this depressed lot,\nfools the public on harijan welfare. Indeed, an aware mass\nof humanity, denied justice for generations, will not take\nit lying down too long but may explode into Dalit Panthers,\nas did the Black Panthers in another country, -a theme on\nwhich Shri Gajendragadkar, a former Chief Justice of India,\nhas laid disturbing stress in two Memorial Lectures\ndelivered recently. Jurists must listen to real life and,\ntheory apart, must be alert enough to read the writing on\nthe wall ! Where the rule of law bars the doors of\ncollective justice, the crushed class will seek hope in the\nstreets! The architects of our Constitution were not\nunfamiliar with direct action where basic justice was long\nwithheld and conceived of 'equal opportunity' as inclusive\nof equalising opportunity. Only a clinical study of organic\nlaw will yield correct diagnostic results.\n\n Social engineering-which is Law in action- must adopt\nnew strategies to liquidate encrusted group injustices or\nsurrender society to traumatic tensions. Equilibrium, in\nhuman terms, emerges from\n\n971\n\nrelease of the handicapped and the primitive from persistent\nsocial disadvantage, by determined creative and canny legal\nmanouvres of the State, not by hortative declaration of arid\nequality. 'To discriminate positively in favour of the weak\nmay sometimes be promotion of genuine equality before the\nlaw' as Anthony Lester argued in his talk in the B.B.C. in\n1970 in the series: 'What is wrong with the Law'. 'One law\nfor the Lion and Ox is oppression'. Or, indeed as was said\nof another age by Anatole France, 'The law in its majestic\nequality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under\nbridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread'.\nRedistributive justice to harijan humanity insists on\neffective reforms, designed to produce equal partnership of\nthe erstwhile 'lowliest and the lost', by State action,\ninformed by short-run and long-run sociologically potent\nperspective planning and implementation. An uneven socio-\neconomic landscape hardly gives the joy or equal opportunity\nand development or draw forth their best from manpower\nresources now wallowing in the low visibility areas of\ndiscontented life.\n\n The domination of a class generates, after a long night\nof sleep or stupor of the dominated, an angry awakening and\nprotestant resistance and this conflict between thesis,\ni.e., the status quo, and anti-thesis i.e., the hunger for\nhappy equality, propels new forces of synthesis i.e., an\nequitable constitution order or just society. Our founding\nfathers, possessed of spiritual insight and influenced by\nthe materialist interpretation of history, forestalled such\nsocial pressures and pre-empted such economic upsurges and\ngave us a trinity of commitments-justice : social, economic\nand political. The 'equality Articles' are part of this\nscheme. My proposition is, given two alternative\nunderstandings of the relevant sub-Articles [Arts. 16(1) and\n(2)], the Court must so interpret the language as to remove\nthat ugly 'inferiority' complex which has done genetic\ndamage to Indian polity and thereby suppress the malady and\nadvance the remedy, informed by sociology and social\nanthropology. My touch-stone is that functional democracy\npostulates participation by all sections of the people and\nfair representation in administration is an index of such\nparticipation.\n\n Justice Brennen, in a somewhat different social milieu,\nuttered words which may not be lost on us:\n\n \"Lincoln said this Nation was 'conceived in\n liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men\n are created equal'. The Founders' dream of a society\n where all men are free and equal has not been easy to\n realize. The degree of liberty and equality that exists\n today has been the product\n\n972\n\n of unceasing struggle and sacrifice. Much remains to be\n done-so much that the very institutions of our society\n have come under challenge. Hence, today, as in\n Lincoln's time, a man may ask 'whether (this) nation or\n any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long\n endure'. It cannot endure if the Nation falls short on\n the guarantees of liberty, justice, and equality\n embodied in our founding documents. But it also cannot\n endure if our precious heritage of ordered liberty be\n allowed to be ripped apart amid the sound and fury of\n our time. It cannot endure if in individual cases the\n claims of social peace and order on the one side and of\n personal liberty on the other cannot be mutually\n resolved in the forum designated by the Constitution.\n If that resolution cannot be reached by judicial trial\n in a court of law, it will be reached elsewhere and by\n other means, and there will be grave danger that\n liberty, equality, and the order essential to both will\n be lost.\"\n\n The Note to r. 13AA explains the immediate motivation\nbehind the rule but the social backdrop set out by me helps\nus appreciate its constitutionality. However, we are under a\nConsitution and mere social anthropology cannot override the\nreal words used in the Constitution. For, Judges may read,\nnot reconstruct. Plainly harijans enjoy a temporary\nadvantage over their non-harijan brethern by virtue of r.\n13AA and this, it is plausibly urged by counsel for the\ncontestants, is violative of the merciless mandate of\nequality 'enshrined' dually in \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n It\ndiscriminates without constitutional justification and\nimports the caste differentia in the face of a contrary\nprovision. The learned Advocate General seeks to meet it\nmore by a legal realist's(approach and, in a sense, by\nresort to functional jurisprudence. What is the\nconstitutional core of equality ? What social philosophy\nanimates it ? What luminous connotation does the pregnant,\nthough terse, phrase 'equality of opportunity for all\ncitizens in matters of employment' bear ? What excesses of\ndiscrimination are banned and what equalitarian implications\ninvite administrative exploration ? Finally, what light do\nwe derive from precedents of this Court on these facets of\n\nArt. 16 ?\n I will examine these contentious issues presently.\n\n The Solicitor General, in his brief but able\nsubmissions, has offered a harmonious and value-based\nconstruction of the constitutional code guaranteeing\nequality (Arts. 14 to 16). Sri Garg has swung to extreme\npositions, some of which spill over beyond the specific\nissue arising in this case. Even so, I agree that a\nquickened social vision is needed to see in the Constitution\nwhat a myopic glimpse may not reveal.\n\n A word of sociological caution. In the light of\nexperience, here and elsewhere, the danger of 'reservation',\nit seems to me, is three-fold. Its benefits, by and large,\nare snatched away by the top creamy layer of the 'backward'\ncaste or class, thus keeping the weakest among the weak\nalways weak and leaving the fortunate layers to consume the\nwhole cake. Secondly, this claim is over-played\nextravagantly in democracy by large and vocal groups whose\nburden of backwardness has been\n\n973\n\nsubstantially lightened by the march of time and measures of\nbetter education and more opportunities of employment, but\nwish to wear the 'weaker section' label as a means to score\nover their near-equals formally categorised as the upper\nbrackets. Lastly, a lasting solution to the problem comes\nonly from improvement of social environment, added\neducational facilities and cross-fertilisation of castes by\ninter-caste and inter-class marriages sponsored as a massive\nState programme, and this solution is calculatedly hidden\nfrom view by the higher 'backward' groups with a vested\ninterest in the plums of backwardism. But social science\nresearch, not judicial impressionism, will alone tell the\nwhole truth and a constant process of objective re-\nevaluation of progress registered by the 'under-dog'\ncategories is essential lest a once deserving 'reservation'\nshould be degraded into 'reverse discrimination'.\nInnovations in administrative strategy to help the really\nuntouched, most backward classes also emerge from such\nsocio-legal studies and audit exercises, if dispassionately\nmade. In fact, research conducted by the A. N. Sinha\nInstitute of Social Studies, Patna, has revealed a dual\nsociety among harijans, a tiny elite gobbling up the\nbenefits and the darker layers sleeping distances away from\nthe special concessions. For them, Arts. 46 and 335 remain a\nnoble romance' the bonanza going to the 'higher' harijans. I\nmention this in the present case because lower division\nclerks are likely to be drawn from the lowest levels of\nharijan humanity and promotion prospects being accelerated\nby withdrawing, for a time, 'test' qualifications for this\ncategory may perhaps delve deeper. An equalitarian break-\nthroug in a hierarchical structure has to use many weapons\nand r. 13AA perhaps is one.\n\n The core conclusion I seek to emphasize is that every\nstep needed to achieve in action, actual, equal, partnership\nfor the harijans, alone amounts to social justice-not\nenshrinement of great rights in Part III and good goals in\nPart IV. Otherwise, the solemn undertakings in Arts. 14 to\n16 read with Arts. 46 and 335 may be reduced to a 'teasing\nillusion or promise of unreality'. A clear vision of the\ntrue intendment of these provisions demands a deep\nunderstanding of the Indian spiritual-secular idea that\ndivinity dwells in all and that ancient environmental\npollution and social placement, which the State must\nextirpate, account for the current socio-economic\nbackwardness of the blacked-out human areas described\neuphemistically as Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\nThe roots of our constitutional ideas-at least some of them-\ncan be traced to our ancient culture. The noble Upanishadic\nbehest of collective acquisition of cultural strength is in\nvolved in and must evolve out of 'equality', if we are true\nto the subtle substance of our finer heritage.\n\n Let me now turn to the essential controversy. Is rule\n13AA valid as protective discrimination to the harijans ?\nThe Advocate General drew our attention to the Articles of\nthe Constitution calculated to overcome the iniquitous\nalienation of harijans from the three branches of\n\n974\n\nGovernment. The Preamble to the Constitution silhouettes a\n\"justiceoriented' community. The Directive Principles of\nState Policy, fundamental in the governance of the country,\nenjoin on the State the promotion 'with special care the\neducational and economic interests of the weaker sections of\nthe people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and\nthe Scheduled Tribes, ... and protect them from social\ninjustice'. To neglect this obligation is to play truant\nwith \nArt. 46.\n Undoubtedly, economic interests of a group-as\nalso social justice to it-are tied up with its place in the\nservices under the State. Our history, unlike that of some\nother countries, has found a zealous pursuit of government\njobs as a mark of share in State power and economic\nposition. Moreover, the biggest-and expanding, with\nconsiderable State undertakings,-employer is Government,\nCentral and State, so much so appointments in the public\nservices matter increasingly in the prosperity of backward\nsegments. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have\nearned special mention in \nArt. 46\n and other 'weaker\nsections', in this context, means not every 'back-ward\nclass' but those dismally depressed categories comparable\neconomically and educationally to Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes. To widen the vent is to vitiate the equal\ntreatment which belongs to all citizens, many of whom are\nbelow the poverty line. Realism reveals that politically\npowerful castes may try to break into equality, using the\nmasterkey of backwardness but leaving aside \nArt. 16(4)\n, the\nramparts of \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n will resist such oblique\ninfiltration.\n\n Even so, does \nArt. 46\n at all authorise the breach of\nuniform equality of opportunity guaranteed by \nArt. 16(1) ?\n\nCan a favoured treatment to harijans, by way of temporary\nconcessions in passing tests, be founded on \nArt. 46\n as a\nbasis for rational classification? Is such a benign\ndiscrimination a caste-oriented legislation contravening\n\nArt. 16(2) ?\n Before I consider these vital questions, I may\nas well glance at some of the important pro-harijan\nprovisions in the Constitution.\n\n The Constitution itself makes a super-classification\nbetween harijans and others, grounded on the, fundamental\ndisparity in our society and the imperative social urgency\nof raising the former's sunken status. Apart from\nreservation of seats in the Legislatures for harijans, which\nis a deliberate departure, taking note of their utter\nbackwardness (\nArt. 330\n and \n332\n, a special officer to\ninvestigate and report to the President upon the working of\nspecial constitutional safeguards made to protect harijans\nhas to be appointed under \nArt. 338.\n Gross inadequacy of\nrepresentation in public services is obviously one subject\nfor investigation and report. More importantly, \nArt. 335\n,\nwhich Shri Garg relied on to hammer home his point, reads:\n\n \"335, Claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n Tribes to services and posts.-The claims of the members\n of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes shall\n be taken into consideration, consistently with the\n maintenance of efficiency of administration, in the\n making of appointments to services and posts in\n connection with the affairs of the Union or of a\n State.\"\n\n975\n\nThis provision directs pointedly to (a) the claims of-not\ncompassion towards-harijans to be given special\nconsideration in the making of appointments to public\nservices; and (b) lest this extra-attention should run riot\nand ruin administrative efficiency, a caution is uttered\nthat maintenance of efficiency in administration should not\nsuffer mayhem.\n\n Now we may deduce from these and other like Articles,\nunaided by authority, certain clear conclusions of great\nrelevance to the present case: (1) The Constitution itself\ndemarcates harijans from others. (2) This is based on the\nstark backwardness of this bottom layer of the community.\n(3) The differentiation has been made to cover specifically\nthe area of appointments to posts under the State. (4) The\ntwin objects, blended into one, are the claims of harijans\nto be considered in such posts and the maintenance of\nadministrative efficiency. (5) The State has been obligated\nto promote the economic interests of harijans and like\nbackward classes, Arts. 46 and 335 being a testament and\nArts. 14 to 16 being the tool-kit, if one may put it that\nway. To blink at this panchsheel is to be unjust to the\nConstitution.\n\n Sri Krishnamoorthy Iyer, for the contesting\nrespondents, argued that harijans may have been grouped\nseparately for protective care by the Constitution but its\nexpression, in the matter of employment under the State, has\nto be subject to the fundamental right of every citizen like\nhis clients to the enjoyment of equal opportunity and non-\ndiscrimination on the score of caste. His proposition is\nthat, in the name of harijan welfare, dilution of \nArt. 16(1)\n\nand \n(2)\n is impermissible under the scheme of Part III which\nis paramount and contains enforceable guaranteed rights.\nSecondly, 'scheduled castes' are castes all the same and\npreferment shown to them is plainly opposed to \nArt. 16(2).\n\nThirdly, even \nArt. 335\n insists on administrative tone, so\nessential to good government, and prolonged exemption from\ntests prescribed by the impugned rule, from the point of\nview of official efficiency, undermines this pertinent\ncriterion. This Court has all along struck down measures of\n'reserved' representation for backward classes in\neducational institutions and public services when a high\nproportion has been so ear-marked, escalating the risk of\nmaking the Administration itself backward. Finally, the\nConstitution has set apart an exclusive exception to the\nequal opportunity rule in \nArt. 16(4)\n, so much so \nArt. 46\n and\n\n335\n must be projected through that provision only and cannot\nspill over into \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n Fundamental rights are\nfundamental and cannot be cut back upon or insidiously\neroded by the classificatory technique.\n\n Both the presentations have a flawless look, the\ncontrolling distinction being between two visions of the\nmood and message of the supreme law we call the\nConstitution, the dynamic and the static, the sociological\nand the formal. It is unexceptional to say that any\ninsightful construction must opt for the former methodology\nand also seek a good fellowship among the various\nprovisions, conventionally called 'harmonious construction'.\nIn an elevating and organic instrument, antagonisms cannot\nexist. If that be the lodester to help interpret the suprema\nlex we have to discover a note of unison in Arts. 16(1), (2)\nand (4) as well as Arts. 46 and 335, the background tune\nbeing\n\n976\n\none of profound effort first to equalise and then to march\ntogether without class-creed distinction. The social\nengineering know-how of our constitution, viz., levelling up\nthe groups buried under the debris by a generous\nconsideration and thereafter enforcing strict equality among\nall-this two-tier process operating symbiotically, is the\nlife of the law and the key to the 'equal opportunity'\nmechanism. Equally emphatic is the grave concern shown for a\ncasteless and classless society-not in a magic instant but\nthrough a careful striving-and for the standards of\nperformance of the Administration, noted from Curzon's days\nfor drowsiness.\n\n Efficiency means, in terms of good government, not\nmarks in examinations only, but responsible and responsive\nservice to the people. A chaotic genius is a grave danger in\npublic administration. The inputs of efficiency include a\nsense of belonging and of accountability which springs in\nthe bosom of the bureaucracy (not pejoratively used) if its\ncomposition takes in also the weaker segments of 'We, the\npeople of India'. No other understanding can reconcile the\nclaim of the radical Present and the hangover of the unjust\nPast.\n\n Now to the precedential guidelines. I am alive to the\ncorrectly reluctant attitude of this Court to depart from\nprecedent lest an unstable and uncertain situation be\ncreated. Stare decisis et non quieta movere. Khanna J. has\nrightly emphasized this great need but also quoted Brandeis\nand Cardozo JJ.:\n\n \"As observed by Brandeis, 'stare decisis is always a\n desideratum, even in these constitutional cases. But in\n them, it is never a command'.\n\n x x x x x\n \"As observed by Cardozo):\n ... ... But I am ready\n\n to concede that the rule of adherence to precedent,\n though it ought not to be abandoned, ought to be in\n some degree relaxed. I think that when a rule, after it\n has been duly tested by experience, has been found to\n be inconsistent with the sense of justice or with the\n social welfare, there should be less hesitation in\n frank avowal and full abandonment. We have had to do\n this sometimes in the field of constitutional law'.\n Anyway, here no case is being over-ruled because no\ncase has said Scheduled Castes and Tribes are a caste nor\nthat advancement of sunken sections of society consistently\nwith administrative efficiency cannot be a rational object\nlinked with outrageous backwardness of a class as the\nintelligible differentia within an official cadre.\n\n \nKeshavananda Bharati has clinched the issue of primacy\nas between Part III and Part IV of the Constitution. The\nunanimous\n\n977\n\nruling there is that the Court must wisely read the\ncollective Directive Principles of Part IV into the\nindividual fundamental rights of Part III, neither Part\nbeing superior to the other! Since the days of Dorairajan\njudicial opinion has hesitatingly tilted in favour of Part\nIII but in \nKeshvananda Bharati\n (supra) the supplementary\ntheory, treating both Parts as fundamental, gained\nsupremacy. Khanna J spoke with a profound sense of depth (if\nI may say so with respect) at p. 1878:\n\n \"The Directive Principles embody a commitment\n which was imposed by the Constitution makers on the\n State to bring about economic and social regeneration\n of the teeming millions who are steeped in poverty,\n ignorance and social backwardness. They incorporate a\n pledge to the coming generations of what the State\n would strive to usher in.\"\n\n *********************************************\n \"There should be no reluctance to abridge or\n regulate the fundamental rights to property if it was\n felt necessary to do so for changing the economic\n structure and attaining the objective contained in the\n Directive Principles.\"\n\n (at p. 1880)\nChandrachud J. has (again, I quote with deference) set the\njudicial singhs straight in this passage (at p. 2050):\n\n \"What is fundamental in the governance of the\n country cannot surely be less significant than what is\n fundamental in the life of an individual. The freedoms\n of a few have to be abridged in order to ensure the\n freedom of all. If State fails to create conditions in\n which the Fundamental freedoms could be enjoyed by all,\n the freedom of the few will be at the mercy of the many\n and then all freedoms will vanish. In order, therefore,\n to preserve their freedom, the privileged few must part\n with a portion of it.\"\n\nThe upshot,, after \nBharati\n, (supra), is that \nArt. 46\n to be\ngiven emphatic expression while interpreting \nArt. 16(1)\n and\n\n(2).\n Indeed, \nArt. 335\n is more specific and cannot be brushed\naside or truncated in the operational ambit vis-a-vis \nArt.\n16(1)\n and \n(2)\n without hubristic aberration.\n\n We may clear the clog of \nArt. 16(2)\n as it stems from a\nconfusion about caste in the terminology of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes. This latter expression has been\ndefined in Arts. 341 and 342 A bare reading brings out the\nquintessential concept that they are no castes in the Hindu\nfold but an amalgam of castes, races, groups, tribes,\ncommunities or parts thereof found on investigation to be\nthe lowliest and in need of massive State aid and notified\nas such by the President. The confuse this backward-most\nsocial composition with\n\n978\n\ncastes is to commit a constitutional error, misled by a\ncompendious appellation. So that, to protect harijans is not\nto prejudice any caste but to promote citizen solidarity.\n\nArt. 16(2)\n is out of the way and to extend protective\ndiscrimination to this mixed bag of tribes, races, groups,\ncommunities and non-castes outside the four-fold Hindu\ndivision is not to compromise with the acceleration of\ncastelessness enshrined in the sub-Article. The discerning\nsense of the Indian Corpus Juris has generally regarded\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, not as caste but as a\nlarge backward group deserving of societal compassion. The\nfollowing provisions of the \nIncome Tax Act, 1961\n are\nillustrative of this principle:\n\n \"13. \nSection 11\n not to apply in certain cases:\n\n (1) (b) Nothing contained in\n s. 11\n or\n s. 12\n shall\n operate so as to exclude from the total income of the\n previous year of the person in receipt thereof\n\n (a) .....\n\n (b) in the case of a trust for charitable purposes or\n a charitable institution created or established\n after the commencement of this Act, any income\n thereof if the trust or institution is created or\n established for the benefit of any particular\n religious community or caste;\n\n *********************************************\n Explanation 2.-A trust or institution created or\n established for the benefit of Scheduled Castes,\n backward classes, Scheduled Tribes or women and\n children shall not be deemed to be a trust or\n institution created or established for the benefit of a\n religious community or caste within the meaning of\n clause (b) of sub-s. (1).\"\n\n The next hurdle in the appellant's path relates to \nArt.\n16(4).\n To my mind, this sub-Article serves not as an\nexception but as an emphatic statement, one mode of\nreconciling the claims of backward people and the\nopportunity for free competition the forward sections are\nordinarily entitled to. In the language of Subba Rao, J. (as\nhe then was), in Devadasan(1):\n\n \"The expression 'nothing in this article' is a\n legislative device to express its intention in a most\n emphatic way that the power conferred thereunder is not\n limited in any way by the main provision but falls\n outside it. It has not really carved out an exception,\n but has preserved a power untrammelled by the other\n provisions of the Article.\"\n\nTrue, it may be loosely said that \nArt. 16(4)\n is an exception\nbut, closely examined, it is an illustration of\nconstitutionally sanctified classification.\n\n979\n\nPublic services have been a fascination for Indians even in\nBritish days, being a symbol of State power and so a special\nArticle has been devoted to it. \nArt. 16(4)\n need not be a\nsaving clause but put in due to the over-anxiety of the\ndraftsman to make matters clear beyond possibility of doubt\n(see, for instance, 59 I.A. 206).\n\n 'Reservation' based on classification of backward and\nforward classes, without detriment to administrative\nstandards (as this Court has underscored) is but an\napplication of the principle of equality within a class and\ngrouping based on a rational differentia, the object being\nadvancement of backward classes consistently with\nefficiency. Arts. 16(1) and (4) are concordant. This Court\nhas viewed \nArt. 16(4)\n as an exception to \nArt. 16(1).\n Does\nclassification based on desparate backwardness render \nArt.\n16(4)\n redundant? No. Reservation confers pro tanto monopoly,\nbut classification grants under \nArt. 16(1)\n ordinarily a\nlesser order of advantage. The former is more rigid,, the\nlatter more flexible, although they may overlap sometimes.\n\nArt. 16(4)\n covers all backward classes; but to earn the\nbenefit of grouping under \nArt. 16(1)\n based on \nArt. 46\n and\n\n335\n as I have explained, the twin considerations of terrible\nbackwardness of the type harijans endure and maintenance of\nadministrative efficiency must be satisfied.\n\n The surviving, but substantial, controversy centres\nround the 'equal opportunity' rule and its transgression, if\nany, by r. 13AA. The learned Advocate General fairly and\nrightly agreed that the impugned rule falls outside \nArt.\n16(4).\n Therefore he sought to salvage the temporary\nexemption from passing tests by urging that a\nconstitutionally valid classification was all that had been\ndone and cited Indian rulings and American juridical\nwritings in support of his stand.\n\n It is platitudinous constitutional law that Arts. 14 to\n16 are a common code of guaranteed equality, the first\nlaying down the broad doctrine, the other two applying it to\nsensitive areas historically important and politically\npolemical in a climate of communalism and jobbery.\n\n We need not tarry to consider whether \nArt. 16\n applies\nto appointments on promotion. It does. Nor need we worry\nabout administrative calamities if test qualifications are\nnot acquired for time by some hands. For one thing, these\ntests are not so telling on efficiency as explained earlier\nby me. And, after all, we are dealing with clerical posts in\nthe Registration Department where aiert quailldriving and a\nsmattering of special knowledge will make for smoother turn-\nout of duties. And the Government is only postponing, not\nforegoing, test qualification. As for the bearing of 'tests'\non basic efficiency, everything depends on the circumstances\nof a case and the post.\n\n The basic question thus is one of social dynamics\nimplied in \nArt. 16(1).\n Let us go to the fundamentals and\nignore the frills. In a spacious sense, 'equal opportunity'\nfor members of a hierarchical society makes sense only if a\nstrategy by which the underprivileged\n\n980\n\nhave environmental facilities for developing their full\nhuman potential. This consummation is accomplished only when\nthe utterly depressed groups can claim a fair share in\npublic life and economic activity, including employment\nunder the State, or when a classless and casteless society\nblossoms as a result of positive State action. To help the\nlagging social segments, by special care, is a step towards\nand not against a larger and stabler equality. I had\noccasion to observe in J & K State v. T. N. Khosa(1).\n\n \"In this unequal world the proposition that all\n men are equal has working limitations, since absolute\n equality leads to Procrustean cruelty or sanctions\n indolent inefficiency. Necessarily, therefore, an\n imaginative and constructive modus vivendi between\n commonness and excellence must be forged to make the\n equality clauses viable. This pragmatism produced the\n judicial gloss of 'classification' and differentia',\n with the by-products of equality among equals and\n dissimilar things having to be treated differently. The\n social meaning of arts. 14 to 16 is neither dull\n uniformity nor specious 'talentism'. It is a process of\n producing quality out of larger areas of equality\n extending better facilities to the latent capabilities\n of the lowly. It is not a methodology of substitution\n of pervasive and slovenly mediocrity for activist and\n intelligent-but not snobbish and uncommitted-cadres.\n However, if the State uses classification casuistically\n for salvaging status and elitism, the point of no\n return is reached for arts. 14 to 16 and the Court's\n jurisdiction awakens to dadden such manouvres. The soul\n of \nart. 16\n is the promotion of the common man's\n capabilities, over-powering environmental adversities\n and opening up full opportunities to develop in\n official life without succumbing to the sophistic\n argument of the elite that talent is the privilege of\n the few and they must rule, wriggling out of the\n democratic imperative of arts. 14 and 16 by theory of\n classified equality which at its worst degenerates into\n class domination.\"\n\nThis observation was approved later by this Court in \nMohd.\nShujat Ali v. Union of India\n(2).\n\n Sri Krishnamoorthy Iyer pressed before us, backed by a\ncatena of cases, that this Court has frowned upon a\nclassification for promotion from within a homogeneous group\nexcept when it is based on qualification for higher\nfunctional efficiency, and to inject a new ground for\ngrouping within the class for promotion was constitutional\nanathema. I think not. The fact that better educational\nprescriptions for promotion posts have been upheld by this\nCourt does not rule out other reasonable differentia, having\na nexus with the object. The true test is, what is the\nobject of the classification and is it permissible ?\n\n981\n\nFurther, is the differentia sound and substantial and\nclearly related to the approved object ? I agree this is\nvirgin ground, but does not, for that reason alone, violate,\nequality. My conclusion is that the genius of Arts. 14 to 16\nconsists not in literal equality but in progressive\nelimination of pronounced inequality. Indeed, to treat\nsharply dissimilar persons equally is subtle injustice.\nEqual opportunity is a hope, not a menace.\n\n If \nArt. 14\n admits of reasonable classification, so does\n\nArt. 16(1)\n and this Court has held so. In the present case,\nthe economic advancement and promotion of the claims of the\ngrossly under-represented and pathetically neglected\nclasses, otherwise described as Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes, consistenly with the maintenance of\nadministrative efficiency, is the object, constitutionally\nsanctioned by Arts. 46 and 335 and reasonably accommodated\nin \nArt. 16(1).\n The differentia, so loudly obtrusive, is the\ndismal social milieu of harijans. Certainly this has a\nrational relation to the object set out above. I must repeat\nthe note of caution earlier struck. Not all caste\nbackwardness is recognised in this formula. To do so is\nsubversive of both \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n The social disparity\nmust be so grim and substantial as to serve as a foundation\nfor benign discrimination. If we search for such a class, we\ncannot find any large segment other than the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes. Any other caste, securing\nexemption from \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n, by exerting political\npressure or other influence, will run the high risk of\nunconstitutional discrimination. If the real basis of\nclassification is caste masked as backward class, the Court\nmust strike at such communal manipulation. Secondly, the\nConstitution recognizes the claims of only harijans (Art.\n\n335) and not of every backward class. The profile of \nArt. 46\n\nis more or less the same. So, we may readily hold that\ncasteism cannot come back by the backdoor and, except in\nexceptionally rare cases, no class other than harijans can\njump the gauntlet of 'equal opportunity' guarantee. Their\nonly hope is in \nArt. 16(4).\n I agree with my learned brother\nFazal Ali J. in the view that the arithmetical limit of 50%\nin any one year set by some earlier rulings cannot perhaps\nbe pressed too far. Overall representation in a department\ndoes not depend on recruitment in a particular year, but the\ntotal strength of a cadre. I agree with his construction of\n\nArt. 16(4)\n and his view about the 'carry forward' rule.\n\n The American jurisprudential response to the problem of\nrepairing the handicaps of the coloureds in public\nemployment and education is similar, although equal\nprotection of the laws to all is assured by the 14th\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\n Jurisprudence, to be living law, must respond to the\nbhangi colony and the black ghetto intelligently enough to\nequalise opportunities within the social, political and\neconomic orders, by making up for long spells of\ndeprivation. Hence, if a court is convinced that the purpose\nof a measure using a suspect classification is truly benign,\nthat is, that the measure represents an effort to use the\nclassification\n\n982\n\nas part of a programme designed to achieve an equal position\nin society for all tribes and groups and communities, then\nit may be justified in permitting the State to choose the\nmeans for doing so, so long as the means chosen are\nreasonably related to achieving that end. The distinction\nwould seem to be between handicaps imposed accidentally by\nnature and those resulting from societal arrangements such\nas caste structures and group suppression. Society being, in\na broad sense, responsible for these latter conditions, it\nalso has the duty to regard them as relevant differences\namong men and to compensate for them whenever they operate\nto prevent equal access to basic, minimal advantages enjoyed\nby other citizens. In a sense, the theory broadens the\ntraditional concept of 'state action' to require government\nattention to those inequalities for which it is not directly\nresponsible, but which nevertheless are concomitant features\nof the existence of the organized state. I quote from\nHarvard Law Review-1968-69. Vol. 82, excerpts from\n'Developments in the Law-Equal Protection':\n\n \"A state might, for example, decide to give some\n racial groups an exemption from qualification\n examinations or establish a racial credit on such\n examinations to that often given to veterans\"\n\n (p. 1105-06) (emphasis, mine)\n * * * * * * * * * * *\n \"Where racial classifications are being used\n ostensibly to remedy deprivations arising from past and\n continuing racial discrimination, however a court might\n think it proper to judge the measures by a less\n stringent standard of review, possibly even the\n permissive or rationality standard normally used in\n constitutional appraisal of regulatory measures\"\n\n (p. 1107)\n * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n Moreover, even if racial classifications do have\n some negative educative effects, the classifications\n may be so effective that they should be instituted\n despite this drawback. If the measures succeed in\n aiding blacks to obtain opportunities within the\n social, political and economic orders that have\n formerly been denied to them, they may be worth the\n cost of emphasizing men's differences. It may be that\n the actual participation of blacks in positions\n alongside whites will ultimately prove to have the most\n important and longlasting educative effect against\n discrimination.\"\n\n (p. 1113)\n\n983\n\n \"Hence, if a court is convinced that the purpose\n of a measure using a racial classification is truly\n benign, that is, that the measure represents an effort\n to use the classification as part of a program designed\n to achieve as equal position in society for all races,\n then it may be justified in permitting the state to\n choose the means for doing so, so long as the means\n chosen are reasonably related to achieving that end.\"\n\n (p. 1115)\n Illustrative of an allied type of State action to\neliminate gross group inequality for attaining general\nequality is a recent ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court. The\ngood omen for American women in Schlessinger v. Ballard(1)\nis indicative of high judicial hunch in understanding the\nclassificatory clue to promotion of employment equality. The\ncase related to a male challenge of a provision entitling\nwomen officers in the U.S. Navy to longer years of\ncommissioned service. The Court remarked, upholding the\nunequal step to promote eventual gender equality, that:\n\n \"in enacting and retaining of Sec. 6401 Congress\n may thus quite rationally have believed that women line\n officers had less opportunity for promotion than did\n their male counterparts and that a longer period of\n tenure for women officers would therefore be consistent\n with the goal to provide women officers with fair and\n equitable career advancement programs\"\n\nThe key thought is the broader test of constitutional\nclassification and this reinforces my line of thinking.\n\n It is a statistically proved social reality in India\nthat the depressed employment position of harijans is the\nmaster problem in the battle against generations of\nretardation, and 'reservation' and other solutions have made\nno significant impact on their employment in public\nservices. In such an unjust situation, to maintain\nmechanical equality is to perpetuate actual inequality. A\nbattery of several programmes to fight down this fell\nbackwardness must be tried out by the State. Relaxation of\n'tests' qualification at the floor level of clerical posts\n(lower or upper division) is a part of this multiform\nstrategy to establish broader, though seemingly\n'differential' equality.\n\n If the Court has its listening posts on raw Indian\nearth, its assessment of 'equal opportunity' cannot remain\nlegalistic or individualistic but should see the age-old\ninequality to mend which is also the means to real equality,\na demanding command of our Constitution. The poignant and\nominous words of Sterling Tucker, in his book 'For Blacks.\nOnly'(1) will awaken the judicial vision to the harijan\nsituation and so I quote:\n\n \"If white Americans had learned to see us as we\n are, human beings, like themselves without individual\n burdens of hope,\n\n984\n\n or fear, they could have understood our rage and our\n defiance. They might have wished to accommodate to it,\n but they could have comprehended it. They could have\n under stood our need for pride and grasped what black\n power meant to us. But as Ralph Ellison potently\n expressed, they never really saw us:\n\n I am an invisible man. . I am a man of substance,\n of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids,-and I might even\n be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand,\n simply be cause people refuse to see me.. When they\n approach me they see only my surrounding, themselves or\n figments of their imgaination-indeed, everything and\n anything except me.\n\n That invisibility to which I refer occurs because\n of a peculiar disposition of the eyes of those with\n whom I come in contact. A matter of the construction of\n their inner eyes, those eyes with which they look\n through their physical eyes upon reality .... You\n wonder whether you aren't simply a phantom in other\n people's minds....You ache with the need to convince\n yourself that you do exist in the real world, that\n you're a part of all the sound and anguish, and you\n strike out with your first, you course and you swear to\n make them recognize you. And, alas, it is seldom\n successful.\"\n\n I end my opinion of concurrence with the learned Chief\nJustice with the admonition, induced by apprehension and for\nreasons already given, that no caste, however seemingly\nbackward, or claiming to be derelict, can be allowed to\nbreach the dykes of equality of opportunity guaranteed to\nall citizens. To them the answer is that, save in rare cases\nof 'chill penury repressing their noble rage', equality is\nequality-nothing less and nothing else. The heady upper\nberth occupants from 'backward' classes do double injury.\nThey beguile the broad community into believing that\nbackwardness is being banished. They rob the need-based bulk\nof the backward of the 'office' advantages the nation, by\nclassification, reserves or proffers. The constitutional\ndharma, however, is not an unending deification of\n'backwardness' and showering 'classified' homage, regardless\nof advancement registered, but progressive exorcising of the\nsocial evil and gradual withdrawal of artificial crutches.\nHere the Court has to be objective resisting mawkish\npolitics. But, by that standard, as statistically shown to\nus in this case, harijan have'nots have 'miles to go' and so\nlong, the Administration has 'promises to keep'.\n\n GUPTA, J. I agree with brother Khanna J. that this\nappeal should be dismissed, and for the reasons given by\nhim. I only wish to add a few words on one aspect of the\nquestion that arises for decision in this case.\n\n The lower division clerks working in the Registration\nDepartment of the State of Kerala have to pass within a\nfixed time certain departmental tests to be eligible for\npromotion as upper division clerks. For\n\n985\n\nsome of these lower division clerks who happen to belong to\nScheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes, the time for passing\nthe tests has been extended by successive orders made by the\nGovernment in exercise of the power conferred by Rule 13AA\nof the Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules, 1958.\nThe High Court of Kerala held that Rule 13AA was violative\nof \nArticle 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n of the Constitution and set aside\nthe orders made under that Rule. On behalf of the appellant.\nState of Kerala, and some of the respondents and\ninterveners, validity of Rule 13AA is sought to be justified\non a construction of \nArticle 16(1)\n which, it is claimed, is\nbased on the provisions of \nArticles 46\n and \n335\n of the\nConstitution. It is contended that \nArticle 16(1)\n should be\nread in the light of the other two Articles. I am not clear\nas to what exactly that means; neither \nArticle 46\n and\n\nArticle 335\n mention \nArticle 16(1)\n, nor \nArticle 16(1)\n refers\nto either of them. All the three Articles co-exist in the\nConstitution which we, the People of India, have given to\nourselves, and if it is correct to say that one of them\nshould be read in the light of the other two, it is equally\nright to suggest that the two of them should be read in the\nlight of the other. This means that the various parts of an\norganic instrument like the Constitution ought to be\nharmoniously construed, but that is not the same thing as\nsuggesting that even where the scope and ambit of one part\nis clear, it should be abridged, extended or amended to\nprove its affinity with another part. Each limb of the body\nhas its own function, and to try to make one of them do the\nwork of another is both unnecessary and unwise; this might\nthrow the entire system out of gear.\n\n \nArticle 16(1)\n declares a right which is one of the\nFundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the\nConstitution, and \nArticle 13(1)\n invalidates all laws\ninconsistent with such rights. \nArticle 16(1)\n lays down:\n\n \"There shall be equality of opportunity for all\n citizens in matters relating to employment or\n appointment to any office under the State.\"\n\n \nArticle 46\n is in Part IV of the Constitution containing\nthe 'Directive Principles of State Policy' \nArticle 46\n reads:\n\n \"The State shall promote with special care the\n educational and economic interests of the weaker\n sections of the people, and, in particular, of the\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall\n protect them from social injustice and all forms of\n exploitation.\"\n\nArticle 37\n states that the provisions contained in Part IV\nshall not be enforceable by the courts but the principles\nembodied in them are \"fundamental in the governance of the\ncountry and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these\nprinciples in making laws\". It is difficult to see how\n\nArticle 46\n which, so far as relevant for the present\npurpose, requires the State to promote with special care the\neconomic interests of the weaker sections of the people,\nespecially of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, can\nserve as an aid to the construction of \nArticle 16(1).\n\n986\n\n \nArticle 335\n occurs in Part XVI of the Constitution\nwhich contains some 'Special Provisions Relating to Certain\nClasses'. \nArticle 335\n provides:\n\n \"The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes\n and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into\n consideration, consistently with the maintenance of\n efficiency of administration, in the making of\n appointments to services and posts in connection with\n the affairs of the Union or of a State.\"\n\nThis Article does not create any right in the members of the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which they might\nclaim in the matter of appointments to services and posts;\none has to look elsewhere, \nArticle 16(4)\n for instance, to\nfind out the claims conceded to them. \nArticle 335\n says that\nsuch claims shall be considered consistently with\nadministrative efficiency; this is a provision which does\nnot enlarge but qualify such claims as they may have as\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. \nArticle\n335\n, it seems clear, cannot furnish any clue to the\nunderstanding of \nArticle 16(1).\n\n \nArticle 16(1)\n which ensures equality of opportunity for\nall citizens in matters relating to employment or\nappointment has been described as an instance or incident of\nthe general guarantee of equality contained in Article 14\n(see \nState of Jammu & Kashmir v. T. N. Khosa & Ors.\n(1).\n\nArticle 14\n which guarantees equality before the law and\nequal protection of the laws, it has been held, does not\ninsist on absolute equality of treatment to all persons in\ndisregard of all differences among them but provides for\nequality among equals only.\n \nThis court observed in \nT.\nDevadasan v. The Union of India\n(2) that \"while the aim of\nthis Article is to ensure that invidious distinction or\narbitrary discrimination shall not be made by the State\nbetween a citizen and a citizen who answer the same\ndescription and the differences which may obtain between\nthem and of no relevance for the purpose of applying a\nparticular law, reasonable classification is permissible\".\nReasonable classification is thus permissible, and often\nnecessary, to achieve this equality. \nArticle 16(1)\n which is\nan instance of the application of the general rule of\nequality with special reference to opportunity for\nappointments under the State also does not require \"......\nabsolute equality as such. What is guaranteed is the\nequality of opportunity and nothing more. \nArticle 16(1)\n or\n(2) does not prohibit the prescription of reasonable rules\nfor selection to any employment or appointment to any\noffice.\n \nAny provision as to the qualifications for the\nemployment or the appointment to office reasonably fixed and\napplicable to all citizens would certainly be consistent\nwith the doctrine of the equality of opportunity; but in\nregard to employment, like other terms and conditions\nassociated with and incidental to it, the promotion to a\nselection post is also included in the matters relating to\nemployment, and even in regard to such a promotion to a\nselection post all that \nArticle 16(1)\n guarantees is equality\nof opportunity to all citizens who enter service\"\n-General\nManager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n(3). \nArticle 16(1)\n\nthus contemplates classification on the basis of eligibility\nfor an appointment; those who have\n\n987\n\nthe qualifications needed for the post form one class; it\nalso implies that the same class of employees constitute a\nseparate unit.\n \nIn \nSham Sunder v. Union of India\n (1), this\nCourt explained that \"\nArticle 16(1)\n means equality as\nbetween members of the same class of employees\" and forbids\nbetween the members of this class discrimination and denial\nof equal opportunity in the matter of promotion.\n\n The lower division clerks in the Registration\nDepartment of the State of Kerala belong to the same class\nas employees. \nArticle 16(1)\n ensures to all of them equality\nof opportunity in the matter of promotion. Rule 13AA and the\norders made thereunder giving additional opportunity in this\nregard to some out of the same class of employees would be\nobviously void unless the fact that the favoured members of\nthe class belong to Seheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes\nmade any difference in the position, as contended. It is\nargued that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes constitute\na well-recognized class of citizens and, as \nArticle 16(1)\n\npermits classification, employees belonging to these castes\nand tribes may be treated as a separate unit for promotion.\nIt is claimed that \nArticle 46\n and \nArticle 335\n encourage such\nfurther classification within the same class which should\ntherefore be regarded as valid for the purpose of \nArticle\n16(1).\n Two assumptions are implicit in this argument: first,\nthat \nArticle 16(1)\n is subservient to \nArticle 46\n and \nArticle\n335\n and has no requirements of its own and, secondly, that\nthese two Article justify the discrimination made by Rule\n13AA. I do not consider either of those assumptions to be\ncorrect. I have stated already that neither \nArticle 46\n nor\n\nArticle 335\n is of any assistance in interpreting \nArticle\n16(1).\n \nArticle 16(1)\n in clear terms insists on equality of\nopportunity for all employees of the same class, and this\nrequirement cannot be dispensed with because of anything in\n\nArticle 46\n or \nArticle 335\n which do not in any way qualify\nthe guarantee in \nArticle 16(1).\n The Article of course\npermits classification, but only such classification as is\nreasonable, and the test of reasonableness, having regard to\nthe object of the Article, must be whether the proposed\nclassification helps in achieving this object. Judging by\nthis test, is it possible to hold the sub-division of lower\ndivision clerks into two categories, those who belong to the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and those who do not,\nas reasonable ? I do not think so; such classification is\nnot relevent to the object of the Article and, therefore,\nnot reasonable.\n\n Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are castes and\ntribes specified by the President under \nArticles 341\n and \n342\n\nof the Constitution to be known as such for the purposes of\nthe Constitution. It is accepted that generally speaking\nthese castes and tribes are backward in educational and\neconomic fields. It is claimed that the expression\n\"Scheduled Castes\" does not refer to any caste of the Hindu\nSociety but connotes a backward class of citizens. A look at\n\nArticle 341\n however will show that the expression means a\nnumber of existing social castes listed in a schedule;\ncastes do not cease to be castes being put in a schedule\nthough backwardness has come to be associated with them.\n\nArticle 46\n requires the State to promote the economic\ninterests of the weaker sections of the people and, in\nparticular, of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\nTribes. The special reference to\n\n988\n\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes does not\nsuggest that the State should promote the economic interests\nof these castes and tribes at the expense of other \"weaker\nsections of the people\". I do not find anything reasonable\nin denying to some lower division clerks the same\nopportunity for promotion as others have because they do not\nbelong to a particular caste or tribe. Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes no doubt constitute a well-defined class,\nbut a classification valid for one purpose may not be so for\nanother; in the context of \nArticle 16(1)\n the sub-class made\nby Rule 13AA within the same class of employees amounts to,\nin my opinion, discrimination only on grounds of race and\ncaste which is forbidden by clause (2) of \nArticle 16.\n \nIn the\n\nState of Rajasthan & Ors. v. Thankur Pratap Singh\n(1) this\nCourt struck down a notification under \nsection 15\n of the\nPolice Act issued by the State of Rajasthan exempting the\nHarijan inhabitants of certain villages from payment of the\ncost of additional police force stationed in those villages.\nIt was held that the notification discriminated against the\nlaw-abiding members of the other communities on the basis\nonly of caste. I do not find it possible to accept that\npicking out employees belonging to the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes from the same class of lower division\nclerks to give them additional opportunity to be promoted as\nupper division clerks is a measure for the promotion of\neconomic welfare of these castes and tribes.\n \nSome incidental\nfinancial gain to certain individuals assuming it results in\nthe welfare of the castes and tribes to which they belong in\nsome remote and indirect way, is not in my view, what\n\nArticle 46\n contemplates; the other view of \nArticle 46\n would\njustify as valid the exemption granted to the Harijan\nvillagers of \nThakur Pratap Singh\n's case from payment of the\ncost of additional police force. In any case, \nArticle 16(1)\n,\nas I have sought to explain earlier, does not permit such\nclassifcation as made by Rule 13AA. That Rule may have been\ninspired by \nArticle 46\n which requires the State to take\nmeasures to bridge the educational and economic gap between\nthe weaker sections of the people and other citizens, but\n\nArticle 46\n does not qualify the provisions of \nArticle 16(1).\n\nArticle 16(1)\n speaks of equality of opportunity, not\nopportunity to achieve equality. For reasons I have stated\nalready, \nArticle 335\n appears to be even less relevant on the\nquestion under consideration.\n\n All I have said above relates to the scope of \nArticle\n16(1)\n only, because counsel for the appellant has built his\ncase on this provision alone. Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n\npermits reservation of appointments or Posts in favour of\nbackward classes of citizens notwithstanding \nArticle 16(1);\n\nI agree with the views expressed by Khanna J. On \nArticle\n16(4)\n which comes in for consideration incidentally in this\ncase. The appalling poverty and backwardness of large\nsections of the people must move the State machinery to do\neverything in its power to better their condition but doling\nout unequal favours to members of the clerical staff does\nnot seem to be a step in that direction: tilting at the\nwindmill taking it to be a monster serves no useful purpose.\n\n989\n\n \nIt may be pertinent in this connection to refer to the\nobservations of Gajendragadkar J. (as he then was) in \nM. R.\nBalaji & Ors. v. State of Mysore\n,(1) which, though made in\nthe context of \nArticle 15(4)\n, has relevance for this case\nalso:\n\n \"When Art 15(4) refers to the special provision\n for the advancement of certain classes or scheduled\n castes or scheduled tribes, it must not be ignored that\n the provision which is authorised to be made is a\n special provision; it is not a provision which is\n exclusive in character, so that in looking after the\n advancement of those classes, the State would be\n justified in ignoring altogether the advancement of the\n rest of the society. It is because the interests of the\n society at large would be served by promoting the\n advancement of the weaker elements in the society that\n \nArt. 15(4)\n authorises special provision to be made. But\n if a provision which is in the nature of an exception\n completely excludes the rest of the society, that\n clearly is outside the scope of \nArt. 15(4).\n It would be\n extremely unreasonable to assume that in enacting \nArt.\n 15(4)\n the Parliament intended to provide that where the\n advancement of the Backward Classes or the Scheduled\n Castes and Tries was concerned, the fundamental rights\n of the citizens constituting the rest of the society\n were to be completely and absolutely ignored.\"\n\nMore recently in the \nState of Jammu & Kashmir v. T. N. Khosa\n& Ors.\n (supra) this Court has sounded a note of caution:\n\n \" ... let us not evolve, through imperceptible\n extensions, a theory of classification which may\n subvert, perhaps submerge, the precious guarantee of\n equality. The eminent spirit of an ideal society is\n equality and so we must not be left to ask in\n wonderment: what after all is the operational residue\n of equality and equal opportunity ?\"\n\nI believe these words are not just so much rhetoric, but\nmean to be taken seriously.\n\n I concur with the order proposed by Khanna J.\n FAZAL ALI J. I agree with the lucid judgment proposed\nby my Lord the Chief Justice, but I would like to add a few\nlines of my own highlighting some of the important aspects\nwhich arise in this appeal.\n\n The facts of this appeal lie within a very narrow\ncompass. This appeal by certificate is directed against the\njudgment of the Kerala High Court dated April 19, 1974. The\njudgment has struck down r. 13-A.A. of the Kerala State and\nSubordinate Service Rules, 1958. The impugned rule was\nsubstituted by Government Order (P) 21/PD dated January 13,\n1972. It appears that the main dispute between the\nappellants and respondent No. 1 centres round the promotion\nof some Lower Division Clerks to the grade of Upper Division\nClerks.\n\n990\n\nThe grievance of respondent No. 1 before the High Court was\nthat some of the Lower Division Clerks who were members of\nscheduled castes or scheduled tribes were shown a\npreferential treatment in that they had been promoted to the\nhigher grade of Upper Division Clerks in spite of the fact\nthat they had not cleared the test prescribed for reaching\nthe said grade. The Government of Kerala selected the\nrespondent for hostile discrimination as against these\npersons by granting extension after extension to the members\nbelonging to the scheduled castes or tribes so as to enable\nthem to pass the test. The series of such extensions\nculminated into the order creating r. 13-A.A. which was\nwholly discriminatory and violative of \nArt. 16\n of the\nConstitution of India. The plea of respondent No. 1 appears\nto have found favour with the High Court which held that r.\n13-A.A. was discriminatory and was clearly violative of \nArt.\n16(1)\n of the Constitution and was also beyond the\nreservation permitted by clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n\n It may be necessary here to mention a few admitted\nfacts. In the first place it is not disputed that respondent\nNo. 1 himself passed the test necessary for promotion to the\nUpper grade on November 2, 1971. It is, therefore, manifest\nthat whatever grievance the respondent No. 1 may have\nagainst the other clerks, he cannot put forward his claim\nfor being promoted earlier than November 2, 1971 i.e. before\nthe time he passed the test. In these circumstances\nextensions granted by the Government to the clerks belonging\nto the scheduled castes or tribes from 1958 to 1972 and\nthereafter upto 1974 will affect the respondent No. 1 only\nafter November 2, 1971 and not before that. Secondly it is\nalso not denied that the Lower Division Clerks belonging to\nthe scheduled castes and tribes were undoubtedly senior to\nthe respondent No. 1 and had been promoted on the express\ncondition that unless they passed the test prescribed by the\nGovernment they would have to be reverted. This was\nobviously done to advance and lift the members of the\nscheduled castes and tribes who were backward class of\ncitizens so that they may be able to compete with the other\nstronger sections of the society. It may also be mentioned\nhere that the promotees were not completely exempted from\nthe test but they were given extension of time for passing\nthe test. Thus it is obvious that but for the passing of the\ntest the respondent No. 1 could not have any other claim to\npromotion as Upper Division Clerk. The respondent No. 1 was\npreviously serving as a Lower Division Clerk in the\nRegistration Department at Kottayam but is at present\nserving in Chitty Auditor's Office at Kottayam. Lastly it is\nalso admitted that the promotees against whom the respondent\nNo. 1 has a grievance were undoubtedly members of the\nscheduled castes or tribes and such Lower Division Clerks\nbelonging to the scheduled castes or tribes will hereafter\nbe referred as 'the promotees' for the purpose of brevity.\n\n In the background of these admitted facts, we have now\nto see whether r. 13-A.A. violates \nArt. 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution in any way. The High Court has struck down r.\n13-A.A. on three grounds:\n\n (1) that it is beyond the permissible limits of\n clause (4) of \nArt. 16;\n\n991\n\n (2) that by virtue of the carry-forward rule the\n Government has promoted more than 62% of the\n clerks belonging to the scheduled castes and\n tribes and have thereby destroyed the concept\n of equality; and\n (3) that the rule is discriminatory inasmuch as\n it makes an uncalled for distinction between\n the members of the same service and\n classification made by the Government is\n neither reasonable nor rational.\n\n It may be mentioned here that the High Court has not\ndisputed that the members of the scheduled castes and tribes\nwere not adequately represented in the services under the\nState of Kerala which is the positive case of the appellants\nbefore us. The High Court has traced the history of the\nvarious orders passed by the Government of Kerala from 1951\nto 1972 granting extensions for two years, three years and\nso on, to the promotees a fact which was not at all germane\nfor the purpose of this case-because the respondent No. 1\nwho was the petitioner before the High Court himself\nadmitted that he had passed the test held on November 2,\n1971. Thus the conduct of the Government in granting\nextensions prior to November 2, 1971 was wholly irrelevant\nin order to decide the question of discrimination as\ncanvessed by respondent No. 1.\n\n Mr. M. M. Abdul Khader, Advocate General of Kerala\nappearing for the appellants submitted two points before us.\nIn the first place he argued that r. 13-A.A. did not provide\nfor reservation as contemplated by clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n of\nthe Constitution and the High Court was, therefore, in error\nin striking down the rule because it exceeded the\npermissible limits of clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n Secondly it was\nsubmitted that the members of the scheduled castes and\ntribes were not only members of one caste but for historical\nreasons they are a special class by themselves and they have\nbeen given an exalted status under the Constitution itself.\nThere is thus nothing in \nArt. 16(1)\n of the Constitution to\nprevent the State from making reasonable classification in\norder to boost up the members of the scheduled castes and\ntribes by giving concessions without imperilling the\nefficiency of the services. The State action in the instant\ncase was, therefore, justified by the Advocate General of\nKerala on the ground that it had only implemented the\ndirective principles contained in Part IV of the\nConstitution. Mr. L. N. Sinha, Solicitor-General appearing\nfor the Attorney General of India and Mr. R. K. Garg\nappearing for the intervener State of U.P. also more or less\nsupported the stand taken by the Advocate General of Kerala.\n\n Mr. T. S. Krishnamoorthy Iyer appearing for the\nrespondent No. 1, however, submitted that classification\ncould only be made under clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n In the\ninstant case even if the provisions contained in r. 13-A.A.\nbe deemed a reservation within the meaning of clause (4) of\n\nArt. 16\n they exceed the permissible limits and destroy the\nconcept of equality. Secondly it was argued that as the\nrespondent No. 1 and the promotees were members of the same\nclass of service they were equally circumstanced and any\ndiscrimination made in favour of the promotees was clearly\nhit by \nArt. 16(1)\n of the Consti-\n\n992\n\ntution. It was also faintly suggested by him that there was\nno reliable evidence to show that the members of the\nscheduled castes and tribes were not adequately represented\nin the services under the State so as to justify any\nclassification being made in their favour.\n\n In order to understand the arguments put forward by the\nparties it may be necessary to examine the nature and extent\nof the provisions of \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution of India.\n\nArticle 16\n may be extracted as follows:\n\n \"16 .(1) There shall be equality of opportunity\n for all citizens in matters relating to employment or\n appointment to any office under the State.\n (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion,\n race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or\n any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated\n against in respect of, any employment or office under\n the State.\n\n (3) Nothing in this article shall prevent\n Parliament from making any law prescribing, in regard\n to a class or classes of employment or appointment to\n an office under the Government of, or any local or\n other authority within, a State or Union territory, any\n requirement as to residence within that State or Union\n territory prior to such employment or appointment.\n (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the\n State from making any provision for the reservation of\n appointments or posts in favour of any backward class\n of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not\n adequately represented in the services under the State.\n (5) Nothing in this article shall affect the\n operation of any law which provides that the incumbent\n of an office in connection with the affairs of any\n religious or denominational institution or any member\n of the governing body thereof shall be a person\n professing a particular religion or belonging to a\n particular denomination.\"\n\n It is no doubt true that \nArt. 16(1)\n provides for\nequality of opportunity for all citizens in the services\nunder the State. It is, however, well-settled that the\ndoctrine contained in \nArt. 16\n is a hard and reeling reality,\na concrete and constructive concept and not a rigid rule or\nan empty formula. It is also equally well-settled by several\nauthorities of this Court that \nArt. 16\n is merely an incident\nof \nArt. 14\n, \nArt. 14\n being the genus is of universal\napplication whereas \nArt. 16\n is the species and seeks to\nobtain equality of opportunity in the services under the\nState. The theory of reasonable classification is implicit\nand inherent in the concept of equality for there can hardly\nbe any country where all the citizens would be equal in all\nrespects. Equality of opportunity would naturally mean a\nfair opportunity not only to one section or\n\n993\n\nthe other but to all sections by removing the handicaps if a\nparticular section of the society suffers from the same. It\nhas never been disputed in judicial pronouncements by this\nCourt as also of the various High Courts that \nArt. 14\n\npermits reasonable classification. But what \nArt. 14\n or \nArt.\n16\n forbid is hostile discrimination and not reasonable\nclassification. In other words, the idea of classification\nis implicit in the concept of equality because equality\nmeans equality to all and not merely to the advanced and\neducated sections of the society. It follows, therefore,\nthat in order to provide equality of opportunity to all\ncitizens of our country, every class of citizens must have a\nsense of equal participation in building up an egalitarian\nsociety, where there is peace and plently, where there is\ncomplete economic freedom and there is no pestilence or\npoverty, no discrimination and oppression, where there is\nequal opportunity to education, to work, to earn their\nlivelihood so that the goal of social justice is achieved.\nCould we, while conferring benefits on the stronger and the\nmore advanced sections of the society, ignore the more\nbackward classes merely because they cannot come upto the\nfixed standards ? Such a course, in my opinion, would lead\nto denial of opportunity to the backward classes resulting\nin complete annihilation of the concept of equality\ncontained in Arts. 14 and 16. The only manner in which the\nobjective of equality as contemplated by the founding\nfathers of our Constitution and as enshrined in Arts. 14 and\n16 can be achieved is to boost up the backward classes by\ngiving them concessions, relaxations, facilities, removing\nhandicaps, and making suitable reservations so that the\nweaker sections of the people may compete with the more\nadvanced and in due course of time all may become equals and\nbackwardness is banished for ever. This can happen only when\nwe achieve complete economic and social freedom. In our vast\ncountry where we have diverse races and classes of people,\nsome of whom are drowned in the sea of ignorance and\nilliteracy, the concept of equality assumes very important\nproportions. There are a number of areas in some States like\nKashmir, Sikkim, hilly areas of U.P., Bihar and the South,\nwhere due to lack of communication or transport, absence of\nproper educational facilities or because of old customs and\nconventions and other environmental reasons, the people are\nboth socially and educationally backward. Could we say that\nthe citizens hailing from these areas should continue to\nremain backward merely because they fall short of certain\nartificial standards fixed by various institutions ? The\nanswer must be in the negative. The directive principles\nenshrined in our Constitution contain a clear mandate to\nachieve equality and social justice. Without going into the\nvexed question as to whether or not the directive principles\ncontained in Part IV override the fundamental rights in Part\nIII there appears to be a complete unanimity of judicial\nopinion of this Court that the directive principles and the\nfundamental rights should be construed in harmony with each\nother and every attempt should be made by the Court to\nresolve any apparent inconsistency. The directive principles\ncontained in Part IV constitute the stairs to climb the high\nedifice of a socialistic State and the fundamental rights\nare the means through which one can reach the top of the\nedifice. I am fortified in my view by several decisions of\nthis Court to which I will refer briefly.\n\n994\n\n In Re. The Kerala Education Bill, 1957(1) this Court\nobserved at p. 1022:\n\n \"Nevertheless, in determining the scope and ambit\n of the fundamental rights relied on by or on behalf of\n any person or body the court may not entirely ignore\n these directive principles of State policy \nlaid down in\n\n Art IV of the Constitution but should adopt the\n principle of harmonious construction and should attempt\n to give effect to both as much as possible.\"\n\n \nIn \nMohd. Hanif Quareshi & others v. The State of\nBihar\n(2) this Court observed as follows:\n\n \"The directive principles cannot over-ride this\n categorical restriction imposed on the legislative\n power of the State. A harmonious interpretation has to\n be placed upon the Constitution and so interpreted it\n means that the State should certainly implement the\n directive principles but it must do so in such a way\n that its laws do not take away or abridge the\n fundamental rights....\"\n\n \nIn \nI. C. Golak Nath & Others v. State of Punjab &\nAnr.\n(3) it was observed by this Court:\n\n \"At the same time Parts III and IV constituted an\n integrated scheme forming a self-contained code. The\n scheme is made so elastic that all the Directive\n Principles of State Policy can reasonably be enforced\n without taking away or abridging the fundamental\n rights.\"\n\n \nIn \nChandra Bhavan Boarding and Lodging, Bangalore v.\nThe State of Mysore and Anr.\n(4) this Court observed:\n\n \"It is a fallacy to think that under our\n Constitution there are only rights and no duties. While\n rights conferred under Part III are fundamental, the\n directives given under Part IV are fundamental in the\n governance of the country. We see no conflict on the\n whole between the provisions contained in Part III and\n Part IV....... The mandate of the Constitution is to\n build a welfare society in which justice social,\n economic and political shall inform all institutions of\n our national life. The hopes and aspirations aroused by\n the Constitution will be belied if the minimum needs of\n the lowest of our citizens are not met.\"\n\n \nFinally the matter has been extensively considered by\nthe Full Court in \nHis Holiness Kesavananda Bharati\nSripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala & Anr.\n(5) where Shelat and\nGrover, JJ., observed: (p. 427)\n \"While most cherished freedoms and rights have\n been guaranteed the Government has been laid under a\n solemn\n\n995\n\n duty to give effect to the Directive Principles. Both\n Parts III and IV which embody them have to be balanced\n and harmonised-then alone the dignity of the individual\n can be achieved.\"\n\nThey further observed: (p. 459)\n \"Our Constitution-makers did not contemplate any\n disharmony between the fundamental rights and the\n directive principles. They were meant to supplement one\n another. It can well be said that the directive\n principles prescribed the goal to be attained and the\n fundamental rights laid down the means by which that\n goal was to be achieved.\"\n\nHegde and Mukherjea, JJ., observed : (p. 503).\n\n \"Our founding fathers were satisfied that there is\n no antithesis between the Fundamental Rights and the\n Directive Principles. One supplements the other. The\n Directives lay down the end to be achieved and Part III\n prescribes the means through which the goal is to be\n reached.\"\n\nRay, J., as he then was and now C.J., observed : (p. 580)\n \"But the Directive Principles are also\n fundamental, They can be effective if they are to\n prevail over fundamental rights of a few in order to\n subserve the common good and not to allow economic\n system to result to the common detriment. It is the\n duty of the State to promote common good.\"\n\nHe further observed : (p. 589)\n \"Parts III and IV of the Constitution touch each\n other and modify. They are not parallel to each other.\n Different legislation will bring in different social\n Principles. These will not be permissible without\n social content operating in a flexible manner.\"\nJaganmohan Reddy, J., observed : (p. 640)\n \"There can be no doubt that the object of the\n Fundamental Rights is to ensure the ideal of political\n democracy and prevent authoritarian rule, while the\n object of the Directive Principles of State Policy is\n to establish a welfare State where there is economic\n and social freedom without which political democracy\n has no meaning. What is implicit in the Constitution is\n that there is a duty on the Courts to interpret the\n Constitution and the laws to further the Directive\n Principles which under \narticle 37\n, are fundamental in\n the governance of the country.\"\n\nPalekar, J., observed : (p. 711)\n \"The Preamble read as a whole, therefore, does not\n contain the implication that in any genuine\n implementation of the Directive Principles, a\n fundamental right will not suffer any diminution.\"\n\n996\n\nMathew, J., observed : (p. 878)\n \"I can see no incongruity in holding, when \narticle\n 37\n says in its latter part \"it shall be the duty of the\n State to apply these principles in making laws\", that\n judicial process is `State action and that the\n judiciary is bound to apply the Directive Principles in\n making its judgment.\"\n\nBeg, J., observed : (p. 902)\n \"Perhaps, the best way of describing the\n relationship between the fundamental rights of\n individual citizens, which imposed corresponding\n obligations upon the State and the Directive\n Principles, would be to look upon the Directive\n Principles as laying down the path of the country's\n progress towards the allied objectives and aims stated\n in the Preamble, with fundamental rights as the limits\n of that path, .............\"\n\nChandrachud, J., observed : (p. 962)\n \"Our decision of this vexed question must depend\n upon the postulate of our Constitution which aims at\n bringing about a synthesis between `Fundamental Rights'\n and the `Directive Principles of State Policy', by\n giving to the former a pride of place and to the latter\n a place of permanence. Together, not individually, they\n form the core of the Constitution. Together, not\n individually, they constitute its true conscience.\"\n In view of the principles adumbrated by this Court it\nis clear that the directive principles form the fundamental\nfeature and the social conscience of the Constitution and\nthe Constitution enjoins upon the State to implement these\ndirective principles. The directives thus provide the\npolicy, the guidelines and the end of socio-economic freedom\nand Arts. 14 and 16 are the means to implement the policy to\nachieve the ends sought to be promoted by the directive\nprinciples. So far as the Courts are concerned where there\nis no apparent inconsistency between the directive\nprinciples contained in Part IV and the fundamental rights\nmentioned in Part III, which in fact supplement each other,\nthere is no difficulty in putting a harmonious construction\nwhich advances the object of the Constitution. Once this\nbasic fact is kept in mind, the interpretation of Arts. 14\nand 16 and their scope and ambit become as clear as day.\n\n In the instant case one of the main planks of the\nargument put forward by Mr. M. M. Abdul Khader, Advocate-\nGeneral, Kerala, was that so far as the scheduled castes and\nthe scheduled tribes were concerned they had been given an\nexalted and privileged status under the Constitution and in\nthe directive principles contained in Part IV which contain\na mandate to the State to consider their claims. It is\nnecessary to consider this aspect of the matter in a little\ndetail, because the main argument of Mr. Abdul Khader has\nbeen that the scheduled castes and tribes did not fall at\nall within the mischief of clause (2) of \nArt. 16\n which\nprohibits discrimination on the ground of caste etc. The\nscheduled caste is not caste as mentioned in \nArt. 16(2).\n I\nam inclined to agree with the argument advanced by the\nAdvocate General that the word\n\n997\n\n`caste' appearing after `scheduled' is really a misnomer and\nhas been used only for the purpose of identifying this\nparticular class of citizens which has a special history of\nseveral hundred years behind it. The scheduled castes and\nscheduled tribes have been a special class of citizens who\nhave been so included and described that they have come to\nbe identified as the most backward classes of citizens that\nwe have in our country. \nArticle 366\n clauses (24) & (25) of\nthe Constitution read thus :\n\n 366 \"(24) \"Scheduled Castes\" means such castes, races\n ortribes or parts of or groups within such\n castes, races or tribes as are deemed under\n \narticle 341\n to be Scheduled Castes for the\n purposes of this Constitution;\n\n (25) \"Scheduled Tribes\" means such tribes or\n tribal communities or parts of or groups\n within such tribes or tribal communities as\n are deemed under \narticle 342\n to be Scheduled\n Tribes for the purposes of this\n Constitution;\"\n\nThese constitutional provisions, therefore, create a\npresumption in favour of scheduled castes and scheduled\ntribes that they are backward classes of citizens. It is not\ndisputed that the members of the scheduled castes and\nscheduled tribes are specified in the notifications issued\nunder Arts. 341 and 342 of the Constitution and, therefore,\nthey must be deemed to be scheduled castes and scheduled\ntribes for the purposes of the Constitution.\n\n \nArticle 46\n of the Constitution runs thus :\n\n \"The State shall promote with special care the\n educational and economic interests of the weaker\n sections of the people, and, in particular, of the\n Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall\n protect them from social injustice and all forms of\n exploitation.\"\n\nProperly analysed this article contains a mandate on the\nState to take special care for the educational and economic\ninterests of the weaker sections of the people and as\nillustrations of the persons who constitute the weaker\nsections the provision expressly mentions the scheduled\ncastes and the scheduled tribes.\n\n A combined reading of \nArt. 46\n and clauses (24) & (25)\nof \nArt. 366\n clearly shows that the members of the scheduled\ncastes and the scheduled tribes must be presumed to be\nbackward classes of citizens, particularly when the\nConstitution gives the example of the scheduled castes and\nthe scheduled tribes as being the weaker sections of the\nsociety.\n\n Similarly Art. 335 which expressly provides that the\nclaims of the members of the scheduled castes and the\nscheduled tribes shall be taken into consideration runs thus\n:\n\n \"The claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes\n and the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into\n consideration, consistently with the maintenance of\n efficiency of administration, in the making of\n appointments to services and posts in connection with\n the affairs of the Union or of a State.\"\n\n998\n\n Thus in view of these provisions the members of the\nscheduled castes and the scheduled tribes have been given a\nspecial status in the Constitution and they constitute a\nclass by themselves. That being the position it follows that\nthey do not fall within the purview of \nArt. 16(2)\n of the\nConstitution which prohibits discrimination between the\nmembers of the same caste. If, therefore, the members of the\nscheduled castes and the scheduled tribes are not castes,\nthen it is open to the State to make reasonable\nclassification in order to advance or lift these classes so\nthat they may be able to be properly represented in the\nservices under the State. This can undoubtedly be done under\n\nArt. 16(1)\n of the Constitution.\n\n Before, however, examining the nature of classification\nthat can be made by the Government under \nArt. 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution it may be necessary to state three principles\nwhich are supported by abundant authority :\n\n (1) That \nArt. 16\n is merely an incident of \nArt. 14\n and\nboth these articles form a part of the common system seeking\nto achieve the same end. I am fortified in my view by\nseveral decisions of this Court. In State of Jammu & Kashmir\nv. Triloki Nath Khosa & Ors.(1) this Court observed : (p.\n\n783)\n \"\nArticle 16\n of the Constitution which ensures to\n all citizens equality of opportunity in matters\n relating to employment is but an instance or incident\n of the guarantee of equality contained in \narticle 14.\n\n The concept of equal opportunity undoubtedly permeates\n the whole spectrum of an individual's employment from\n appointment through promotion and termination to the\n payment of gratuity and pension.\"\n\n \nIn \nMohammad Shujat Ali and others v. Union of India and\nothers\n(2) this Court observed:\n\n \"\nArticle 14\n ensures to every person equality\n before law and equal protection of the laws and \nArticle\n 16\n lays down that there shall be equality of\n opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to\n employment or appointment to any office under the\n State. \nArticle 16\n is only an instance or incident of\n the guarantee of equality enshrined in \nArticle 14;\n it\n gives effect to the doctrine of equality in the sphere\n of public employment. The concept of equal opportunity\n to be found in \nArticle 16\n permeates the whole spectrum\n of an individual's employment from appointment through\n promotion and termination to the payment of gratuity\n and pension and gives expression to the ideal of\n equality of opportunity which is one of the great\n socio-economic objectives set out in the Preamble of\n the Constitution.\"\n\n \nIn \nGovind Dattatray Kelkar and others v. Chief\nController of Imports & Exports and others\n,(3) this Court\nobserved :\n\n999\n\n \"\nArt. 16\n of the Constitution is only an incident\n of the application of the concept of equality enshrined\n in \nArt. 14\n thereof. It gives effect to the doctrine of\n equality in the matter of appointment and promotion. It\n follows that there can be a reasonable classification\n of the employees for the purpose of appointment or\n promotion.\"\n\nThe same view was expressed by this Court in \nS.G.\nJaisinghani v. Union of India and Others\n.\n\n \nIn \nThe General Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n\nthis Court observed :\n\n \"In this connection it may be relevant to remember\n that \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n really give effect to the\n equality before law guaranteed by \nArt. 14\n and to the\n prohibition of discrimination guaranteed by \nArt. 15\n (1).\n The three provisions form part of the same\n constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each\n other. If that be so, there would be no difficulty in\n holding that the matters relating to employment must\n include all matters in relation to employment both\n prior, and subsequent, to the employment which are\n incidental to the employment and form part of the terms\n and conditions of such employment.\"\n\n \n(2) It is also well-settled that \nArt. 16\n applies to all\nclasses of appointment including promotions and selection\nposts. It has been observed by this Court in \nC. A. Rajendran\nv. Union of India and Ors.\n(3) :\n\n \"The first question to be considered in this case\n is whether there is a constitutional duty or obligation\n imposed upon the Union Government to make reservations\n for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes either at the\n initial stage of recruitment and at the stage of\n promotion in the Railway Board Secretariat Service\n Scheme.\n\n The relevant law on the subject is well-settled.\n Under \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution there shall be\n equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters\n relating to employment or appointment to any office\n under the State or to promotion from one office to a\n higher office thereunder. \nArticles 14\n, 15\n and \n16\n form\n part of the same constitutional code of guarantees and\n supplement each other. In other words, \nArt. 16\n of the\n Constitution is only an incident of the application of\n the concept of equality enshrined in \nArt. 14\n thereof.\n It gives effect to the doctrine of equality in the\n matter of appointment and promotion. It follows\n therefore that there can be a reasonable classification\n of the employees for the purpose of appointment and\n promotion.\"\n\n1000\n\n \nIn \nState of Jammu & Kashmir v. Triloki Nath Khosa and\nothers\n (supra) it was observed by this Court :\n\n \"Since the constitutional code of equality and\n equal opportunity is a charter for equals, equality of\n opportunity in matters of promotion means an equal\n promotional opportunity for persons who fall,\n substantively, within the same class. A classification\n of employees can therefore be made for first\n identifying and then distinguishing members of one\n class from those of another.\"\n\nThe same view has been expressed by this Court in \nC.A.\nRajendran\n's case; in \nS. G. Jaisinghani\n's case; Rangachari's\ncase and \nMohammad Shujat Ali\n's case, quoted supra.\n\n The concept of equality or equal opportunity as\ncontained in \nArt. 16\n does not mean that same laws must be\napplicable to all persons under every circumstance. Indeed\nif this artificial interpretation is put on the scope and\nambit of \nArt. 16\n it will lead to channelisation of\nlegislation or polarisation of rules. Differences and\ndisparities exist among men and things and they cannot be\ntreated alike by the application of the same laws but the\nlaw has to come to terms with life and must be able to\nrecognise the genuine differences and disparities that exist\nin human nature. Legislature has also to enact legislation\nto meet specific ends by making a reasonable and rational\nclassification. In Morey v. Doud(1) it was so aptly observed\n:\n\n \"To recognise marked differences that exist in\n fact is living law; to disregard practical differences\n and concentrate on some abstract identities is lifeless\n logic.\"\n\n Coming now to \nArt. 16\n it may be analysed into three\nseparate categories so far as the facts of the present case\nare concerned :\n\n Category I-Clause (1) of \nArt. 16.\n\n Category II-Clause (2) of \nArt. 16.\n\n Category III-Clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n\n Clause (1) of \nArt. 16\n clearly provides for equality of\nopportunity to all citizens in the services under the State.\nIt is important to note that the Constitution uses the words\n\"equality of opportunity for all citizens\". This inherently\nimplies that the opportunity must be given not only to a\nparticular section of the society or a particular class of\ncitizens who may be advanced or otherwise more afflunt but\nto all classes of citizens. This, therefore, can be achieved\nby making a reasonable classification so that every class of\ncitizens is duly represented in the services which will\nenable equality all citizens. The classification, however,\nmust be a reasonable one and must fulfil the following\nconditions:\n\n (i) it must have a rational basis;\n\n (ii) it must have a close nexus with the object\n sought to be achieved;\n\n1001\n\n (iii)it should not select any person for hostile\n discrimination at the cost of others.\n\nNow let us see whether r. 13-A.A. can be justifiable under\nclause (1) of \nArt. 16.\n Rule 13-A.A. of the Rules reads thus:\n\n \"Notwithstanding anything contained in these\n rules, the Government may, by order, exempt for a\n specified period, any member or members, belonging to a\n Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, and already in\n service, from passing the tests referred to in rule 13\n or rule 13A of the said Rules.\"\n\nWhat the rule does is merely to authorise the Government to\nexempt for a specified period any member or members of the\nscheduled castes and scheduled tribes from pasing the tests\nreferred to in r. 13 and r. 13A. It may be noticed that this\nrule does not at all give a complete licence. A Lower\nDivision Clerk who is a member of the scheduled caste or\nschedule tribe could not be promoted without passing any\ntest at all so as to destroy the concept of equality. It\nmerely gives a special concession or a temporary relaxation\nto backward class of citizens in order to lift them, advance\nthem and enable them to compete with the stronger sections\nof the society. Thus the basis of the rule is undoubtedly\nboth rational and reasonable.\n\n \nArticle 335\n of the Constitution contains a mandate to\nthe State for considering the claims of the members of the\nscheduled castes and the scheduled tribes consistently with\nthe maintenance of efficiency of administration. By giving\nthe special concessions to the promotees this mandate is\nsought to be obeyed by the Government. Mr. T. S. Krishna\nmoorthy Iyer counsel for the respondent No. 1 submitted that\nthe mandate given in \nArt. 335\n is violated because by\ngranting exemption to the members of the scheduled castes\nand tribes the standard of efficiency of the services would\nbe impaired. We are, however, unable to agree with the\nargument. Both the respondent No 1 and the promotees were\nmembers of the same service and had been working as Lower\nDivision Clerks for a pretty long time. The promotees who\nwere members of the scheduled castes and tribes are\nadmittedly senior to respondent No. 1 and have gained more\nexperience. Further the rule does not grant complete\nexemption to the promotees from passing the test; it only\nprovides for grant of extension of time to enable them to\nclear the test. In these circumstances it cannot be held\nthat the State's action in incorporating r. 13-A.A. in any\nway violates the mandate contained in \nArt. 335.\n In these\ncircumstances, therefore, I am clearly satisfied that the\nconcession given in r. 13-A.A. amounts to a reasonable\nclassification which can be made under \nArt. 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution and does not amount to the selection of the\nrespondent No. 1 for hostile discrimination so as to be\nviolative of \nArt. 16(1)\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n Category II refers to clause (2) of \nArt. 16\n which may\nbe reproduced as follows:\n\n \"No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion,\n race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or\n any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated\n against in respect of, any employment or office under\n the State.\"\n\n1002\n\nIn view of my findings and the various provisions of the\nConstitution regarding the status of the members of the\nscheduled castes and the scheduled tribes, it is obvious\nthat the members of the scheduled castes and the scheduled\ntribes are not a 'caste' but a special class of backward\ncitizens whose backwardness cannot be doubted. In these\ncircumstances, therefore, if the promotees do not belong to\na caste as contemplated by \nArt. 16(2)\n then they do not fall\nwithin the mischief of \nArt. 16(2)\n at all. Thus the case of\nthe promotees squarely falls within the four corners of \nArt.\n16(1)\n and can be justified as based on reasonable\nclassification.\n\n Before leaving categories I and II it might be\nmentioned that the Court has to apply strict scrutiny to the\nclassification made by the Government and to find out that\nit does not destroy or fructify the concept of equality. In\nother words, the State cannot be permitted to invoke\nfavourtism or nepotism under the cloak of equality. Having\nconsidered the matter in all its comprehensive aspects I am\nsatisfied that in this particular case the classification\nmade by the Government by virtue of r. 13-A.A. is fully\njustified by \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution.\n\n This brings us to the consideration of Category III\nwhich is clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n Clause (4) may be extracted\nas under:\n\n Nothing in this article shall prevent the State\n from making any provision for the reservation of\n appointments or posts in favour of any backward class\n of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not\n adequately represented in the services under the\n State.\"\n\nClause (4) of \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution cannot be read in\nisolation but has to be read as part and parcel of \nArt.\n16(1)\n \n& (2).\n Suppose there are a number of backward classes\nwho form a sizeable section of the population of the country\nbut are not properly or adequately represented in the\nservices under the State the question that arises is what\ncan be done to enable them to join the services and have a\nsense of equal participation. One course is to make a\nreasonable classification under \nArt. 16(1)\n in the manner to\nwhich I have already adverted in great detail. The other\nmethod to achieve the end may be to make suitable\nreservations for the backward classes in such a way so that\nthe inadequate representation of the backward classes in the\nservices is made adequate. This form of classification which\nis referred to as reservation, is, in my opinion, clearly\ncovered by \nArt. 16(4)\n of the Constitution, which is\ncompletely exhaustive on this point. That is to say clause\n(4) of \nArt. 16\n is not an exception to \nArt. 14\n in the sense\nthat whatever classification can be made can be done only\nthrough clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n Clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n,\nhowever, is an explanation containing an exhaustive and\nexclusive provision regarding reservation which is one of\nthe forms of classification. Thus clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n\ndeals exclusively with reservation and not other forms of\nclassification which can be made under \nArt. 16(1)\n itself.\n\nSince clause (1) is a special provision regarding\nreservation, it can safely be held that it overrides \nArt.\n16(1)\n to that extent and no reservation can be made under\nArt 16(1). It is true that there are some authorities of\nthis\n\n1003\n\nCourt that clause (4) is an exception to \nArt. 16(1)\n but with\ndue respect I am not in a position to subscribe to this view\nfor the reasons that I shall give hereafter.\n\n In the first place if we read \nArt. 16(4)\n as an\nexception to \nArt. 16 (1)\n then the inescapable conclusion\nwould be that \nArt. 16(1)\n does not permit any classification\nat all because an express provision has been made for this\nin clause (4). This is, however, contrary to the basic\nconcept of equality contained in \nArt. 14\n which implicitly\npermits classification in any form provided certain\nconditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, if no classification\ncan be made under \nArt. 16(1)\n except reservation contained in\nclause (4) then the mandate contained in \nArt. 335\n would be\ndefeated.\n\n I have already observed that the fundamental guarantees\nprovided by the Constitution have to be read in harmony with\nthe directive principles contained in Part IV. Again if \nArt.\n16(4)\n is deemed to be the only mode of classification, then\nit would follow that the Constitution permits only one form\nof classification, namely, reservation and no other form so\nfar as the services are concerned. This will render the\nconcept of equality nugatory and defeat the very purpose\nwhich is sought to be achieved by \nArt. 16(1).\n Equality of\nopportunity to all citizens does not mean equality to some\nand inequality to others. As I have already pointed out that\nin our country there are a large number of backward classes\nof citizens who have to be granted certain concessions and\nfacilities in order to be able to compete with others. Does\nit mean that such citizens should be denied these facilities\nwhich may not fall under the term 'reservation' ? Let us\ntake a few instances. A notification provides that all\ncandidates for a particular post must apply before a\nspecified date. A person belonging to a backward class of\ncitizens living in a very remote area gets information late.\nThe Government, however, in case of such a backward class\ncandidate makes a relaxation and extends the date. Can it be\nsaid that this has resulted in violation of \nArt. 16(1)\n\nbecause it does not fall within the reservation contemplated\nby clause (4) of \nArt. 16 ?\n It is obvious that the intention\nof the Government is merely to help the backward class of\ncitizens to apply for the job along with others by condoning\nthe delay for special reasons. Another instance may be where\nthe State makes a relaxation regarding the age in case of\nbackward classes of citizens in view of the far-fetched and\ndistant area to which that class of citizens belongs. Lastly\nlet us take the instance of the present case. The clerks\nbelonging to the scheduled castes and tribes were given a\nfurther extension of time to pass the test because of their\nbackwardness. They were not exempted from passing the test.\nThis could only be done under \nArt. 16(1)\n and not under\nclause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n\n \nFor these reasons, therefore, I respectfully agree with\nthe observations of Subba Rao, J., as he then was in \nT.\nDevadasan v. The Union of India and Anr\n(1) where he\nobserved:\n\n \"That is why the makers of the Constitution\n introduced cl. (4) in \nArt. 16.\n The expression \"nothing\n in this article\" is a legislative device to express its\n intention in a most\n\n1004\n\n emphatic way that the power conferred thereunder is not\n limited in any way by the main provision but falls\n outside it. It has not really carved out an exception,\n but has preserved a power untrammelled by the other\n provisions of the Article.\"\n\nMy view that \nArt. 16(4)\n is not a proviso to \nArt. 16(1)\n but\nthat this clause covers the whole field of \nArt. 16\n is amply\nsupported by the decision of this Court in \nThe General\nManager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n (supra) where it was\nobserved: (p. 599)\n \"It is common ground that \nArt. 16(4)\n does not cover the\n entire field covered by \nArt. 16(1)\n and \n(2).\n Some of the\n matters relating to employment in respect of which\n equality of opportunity has been guaranteed by \nArt.\n 16(1)\n and \n(2)\n do not fall within the mischief of non-\n obstant clause in \nArt. 16 (4).\"\n\n Now analysing clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n it appears that it\ncontains express provisions empowering the State to make\nreservations in suitable cases provided the following\nconditions are satisfied:\n\n (i) that the class for which reservation is made\n is must be socially and educationally\n backward.\n\n I might mention that so far as the members of the\nscheduled castes and tribes are concerned, in view of the\nconstitutional provisions \nreferred to above\n, this fact will\nhave to be presumed and it was also so held in Rangachari's\ncase supra.\n\n (ii) That the class for which reservation is made\n is not adequately represented in the services\n under the State.\n\n So far as this is concerned it was suggested by Mr.\nKrishnamoorthy Iyer appearing for respondent No. 1 that\nthere is no material on the record to show that the\npromotees were not adequately represented in the services\nunder the State and the Government had not issued any\nnotification declaring this fact. It, however, appears that\nthis point was not canvassed before the High Court at all.\nNevertheless the appellants have produced before us\nsufficient materials to show that the members of the\nscheduled castes and the scheduled tribes were not\nadequately and properly represented in the services under\nthe State and particularly in the Registration Department\nwith which we are dealing in this appeal. It is clear from\nAnnexure 'A' of the Appeal Paper Book that there were as\nmany as 2254 non-gazetted employees in the Registration\nDepartment out of which members of the scheduled castes and\ntribes are only 198. It has also been stated in the counter-\naffidavit before the High Court that the members of the\nscheduled castes and tribes form about 8 per cent. of the\npopulation of the State of Kerala. This, therefore, clearly\nshows that the promotees were inadequately represented in\nthe services under the State and, therefore, they fulfil the\nsecond condition required by clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n\n1005\n\n (iii)The reservation should not be too excessive\n so as to destroy the very concept of\n equality.\n\n This means that the reservation should be within the\npermissible limits and should not be a cloak to fill all the\nposts belonging to a particular class of citizens and thus\nviolate \nArt. 16(1)\n of the Constitution indirectly. At the\nsame time clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n does not fix any limit on\nthe power of the Government to make reservation. Since\nclause (4) is a part of \nArt. 16\n of the Constitution it is\nmanifest that the State cannot be allowed to indulge in\nexcessive reservation so as to defeat the policy contained\nin \nArt. 16(1).\n As to what would be a suitable reservation\nwithin permissible limits will depend upon the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule can be\nlaid down, nor can this matter be reduced to a mathematical\nformula so as to be adhered to in all cases. Decided cases\nof this Court have no doubt laid down that the percentage of\nreservation should not exceed 50%. As I read the\nauthorities, this is, however, a rule of caution and does\nnot exhaust all categories. Suppose for instance a State has\na large number of backward classes of citizens which\nconstitute 80% of the population and the Government, in\norder to give them proper representation, reserves 80% of\nthe jobs for them, can it be said that the percentage of\nreservation is bad and violates the permissible limits of\nclause (4) of \nArt. 16 ?\n The answer must necessarily be in\nthe negative. The dominant object of this provision is to\ntake steps to make inadequate representation adequate.\n\n This brings us to the validity of the carry-forward\nrule which also has been touched by the High Court. It has\nbeen held by the High Court that as a result of the special\nrule adopted by the State 34 out of 51 vacancies have been\nfilled up by the members of the scheduled castes and tribes,\nthus far exceeding the 50 per cent limit which has been \nlaid\ndown by\n this Court. \nIt is true that in \nT. Devadasan\n's case\n(supra) the majority judgment of this Court did strike down\na rule which permitted carry-forward of the vacancies. With\nrespect, however, I am not able to agree with this view\nbecause such a rule some times defeats the ends of \nArt. 16\n\nitself. By the carry-forward rule what is meant is that if\nsuppose there are 50 vacancies in a year, 25 of such\nvacancies are set apart for backawrd classes of citizens and\nif out of these 25 only 10 such candidates are available,\nthen the remaining 15 vacancies instead of being kept vacant\nwhich may result in inefficiency and stagnation are filled\nup from other classes but the deficiency is sought to be\nmade up in the next year or in the year next to that. I can\nsee no objection to this course being adopted which is fully\nin consonance with the spirit of clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n The\nmain idea is to give adequate representation to the backward\nclasses of citizens if they are not adequately represented\nin the services. What difference does it make if instead of\nkeeping the reserved vacancies vacant from year to year as a\nresult of which work of the Government would suffer they are\nallowed to be filled up by other candidates and the number\nof vacancies so filled up are kept reserved for the next\nyear to accommo-\n\n1006\n\ndate candidates from backward classes. This does not and\ncannot destroy the concept of equality, nor result in\nhostile discrimination to one or the other. There can be no\ndoubt that reservation to the extent of 50% is permissible\nand if the candidates to that extent are not available, and\nthose vacancies could not be filled up by other candidates\nthen such candidates would not get any appointment at all.\nIt is only by chance that some of the candidates of the\nbackward classes not being available that the other\ncandidates are appointed. In fact if the carry-forward rule\nis not allowed to be adopted it may result in inequality to\nthe backward classes of citizens who will not be able to be\nabsorbed in public employment in accordance with the full\nquota reserved for them by the Government. Thus if the carry\nforward rule is not upheld, then backwardness will be\nperpetrated and it would result ultimately in a vacuum. For\nthese reasons, therefore, I am of the opinion that the High\nCourt was in error in holding that the State's action in\nfilling 34 vacancies out of 51 by members of the scheduled\ncastes and tribes was illegal and could not be justified.\n\n (iv) Reservation should not be made at the cost of\n efficiency.\n\n This is a very important condition for the application\nof clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n No reservation can be made at the\ncost of efficiency which is the prime consideration. But one\nshould not take an artificial view of efficiency. A\nconcession or relaxation in favour of a backward class of\ncitizens particularly when they are senior in experience\nwould not amount to any impairment of efficiency. It is,\nhowever, not necessary for me to dilate on this aspect\nbecause in my view the relaxation contained in r. 13-A.A. of\nthe rules does not fall within clause (4) of \nArt. 16\n but\nfalls squarely within clause (1) of \nArt. 16\n as shown above,\nand, therefore, I am of the opinion that the High Court was\nin error in holding that r. 13-A.A. was ultra vires and was\nviolative of \nArt. 16\n as it thought that this rule came\nwithin the mischief of clause (4) of \nArt. 16.\n\n \nBefore closing this judgment I would like to allay a\nserious apprehension that has been expressed by learned\ncounsel for respondent No. 1 that if the Court is to give a\nwide and liberal interpretation to \nArt. 14\n and \nArt. 16\n, the\nguarantees of fundamental right to equality might be\ncompletely eroded in due course of time. I have given my\nanxious consideration to this argument and I am clearly of\nthe opinion that the apprehension expressed by the learned\ncounsel does not appear to be well founded. This Court has\nupheld in several cases classifications graver and more\ndamaging than the one made in the present case without\naffecting the concept of equality. For instance in \nTriloki\nNath Khosa\n's case (supra) this Court upheld a classification\nmade by the State between the members of the same service,\nrecruited from the same source and holding the same posts on\nthe ground that one set of members having possessed a higher\nqualification, namely, a degree in engineering, could\nconstitute a separate class and could be differently treated\nfrom the other members of the same service who were merely\ndiploma holders. What had happened \nin that case\n was that the\nservice of Engineers was one integrated service consisting\nof\n\n1007\n\nAssistant Engineers who were merely diploma holders and\nthose who were degree holders. The Government passed an\norder by which the degree holders could be promoted to\nhigher grade of service, namely, to the posts of Executive\nEngineer or Superintending Engineer, which was however\nblocked to those Assistant Engineers who were merely diploma\nholders. This rule was struck down by the High Court of\nJammu & Kashmir but the Supreme Court on appeal held that\nqualification was a reasonable ground of classification and\nby virtue of the qualification the Assistant Engineers who\nwere degree holders could be shown a preferential treatment.\nThe position does not appear to be worse in this case and on\na parity of reasoning the Government has merely extended the\ntime prescribed for departmental tests for the promotees by\ntreating them as a special class for two reasons-(1) that\nthey were senior to and more experienced than the respondent\nNo. 1; and (2), that they belonged to backward classes being\nmembers of the scheduled castes and tribes and for\nhistorical reasons they did not have sufficient opportunity\nto develop their genius and intellectual capacity as others\ncould do. I, therefore, see no reason to hold that this\nclassification was in any way unreasonable or arbitrary. The\nconditions under which classification has to be made, as\npointed out by me, are so strict and stringent that the\napprehension of erosion of the concept of equality appears\nto be illusory. We must remember that the Courts are meant\nto interpret and not make the law. As Justice Frankfurter\nobserved.\n\n \"A Judge must not re-write a statute, neither to\n enlarge nor to contract it.\"\n\n Finally there can be no doubt that if the State action\nin a particular case amounts to an arbitrary classification\nor a hostile discrimination which is violative of \nArt. 16\n of\nthe Constitution the Court is there to act as sentinel on\nthe qui vive in order to strike down such an action.\n\n For the reasons given above, I have come to the\nconclusion that r. 13-A.A. of the rules is a valid piece of\nstatutory provision which is fully justified under \nArt.\n16(1)\n of the Constitution of India and does not fall within\nthe purview of \nArt. 16(4).\n\n I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the\njudgment of the High Court and direct the status quo ante to\nbe restored. In the circumstances of this case, I leave the\nparties to bear their respective costs.\n\n ORDER\nOrder by Majority-\n\n The validity of Rule 13AA of the Kerala State and\nSubordinate Services Rules, 1958 and two orders, Exhibits P-\n2 and P-6 is upheld. The judgment of the High Court is set\naside and the appeal is allowed. Parties will pay and bear\ntheir own costs.\n\nP.B.R.\n\n1008",

Rule 13A which was introduced sometime later, gave\ntemporaury exemption from passing the departmental tests for\na period of two years. The rule also provided that an\nemployee who did not pass the unified departmental tests\nwithin the period of two years from the date of introduction\nof the test would be reverted to the lower post and further\nsaid that he shall not again be eligible for appointment\nunder this rule. Proviso 2 to this rule gave temporary\nexemption of two years in the case of Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes candidates. A Harijan Welfare Association\nrepresented to the State Government that a large number of\nHarijan employees in the State service were facing immediate\nreversion as a result of this rule and requuested the\nGovernment to grant exemption in respect of Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes employees from passing the obligatory\ndepartmental tests for a period of two years with immediate\neffect.

Under \nArt. 16\n there can be a\nreasonable classification of the employees in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment. [926F]\n State of Gujarat and Anr. etc. v. Shri Ambica Mills\nLtd. Ahmedabad etc. A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1300, referred to.\n (2) Equality is violated if it rests on an unreasonable\nbasis. The concept of equality has an inherent limitation\narising from the very nature of the constitutional\nguarantee. Those who are similarly circumstanced are\nentitled to equal treatment. Classification is to be founded\non substantial differences which distinguish persons grouped\ntogether from those left out of the groups and such\ndifferential attributes must bear a just and rational\nrelation to the object sought to be achieved. [927 C]\n (3) If there is a rational classification consistent\nwith the purpose for which such classification is made\nequality is not violated. The categories of classification\nfor purposes of promotion can never be closed on the\ncontention that they are all members of the same cadre in\nservice. If classification is made on educational\nqualifications for purposes of promotion or if\nclassification is made on the ground that the persons are\nnot similarly circumstanced in regard to their entry into\nemployment such classification can be justified. [927E-F]\n C. V. Rajendran v. Union of India [1968] 1 S.C.R. 721,\nfollowed.\n (4) Art 1.(1) does not bar a reasonable classification\nof employees or reasonable tests for their selection.

[928 F]\n State of Mysore v. V. P. Narasinga Rao [1968] 1 S.C.R.\n407, referred to.\n (5) Under \nArt. 16(1)\n equality of opportunity of\nemployment means equality as between members of the same\nclass of employees and not equality between. members of\nseparate, independent class. The present case does not\ncreate separate avenues of promotion for these persons. [928\nF]\n All India Station Masters and Assistant Station\nMasters' Association v. General Manager, Central Railways\n[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311, referred to.\n (6) The Legislature understands and appreciates the\nneeds of its own people that its laws are directed to\nproblems made manifest by experience and that its\ndiscriminations are based upon adequate grounds. The rule of\nclassification is not a natural and logical corollary of the\nrule of equality, but the rule of differentiation is\ninherent in the concept of equality. Equality means parity\nof treatment under parity of conditions. Equality does not\nconnote absolute equality. A classification, in order to be\nconstitutional, must rest upon distinctions that are\nsubstantial and not merely illusory. The test is whether it\nhas a reasonable basis free from artificiality and\narbitrariness embracing all and omitting none naturally\nfalling into that category. [929 D]\n Govind Dattatray Kelkar v. Chief Controller of Imports,\n[1967] 2 S.C.R. 29; Ganga Ram v. Union of India [1970] 1\nS.C.C. 377 and Roshan Lal Tandon v Union of India [1968] I\nS.C.R. 185, referred to.\n (7) The relevant touchstone of validity is to find out\nwhether the rule of preference secures adequate\nrepresentation for the unrepresented backward community or\ngoes beyond it. [930 G]\n (8) The historical background of the rules justifies\nthe classification of the personnel of the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes for the purpose of granting them\nexemption from special tests with a view to ensuring them\nthe\n908\nequality of treatment and equal opportunity in matters of\nemployment having regard to their backwardness and under-\nrepresentation in the employment of he State. [931 C]\n (9) (a) The Constitution makes a classification of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in numerous provisions\nnamely Arts. 46, 335, 338 and 341 and gives a mandate to the\nState to accord special or favoured treatment to them. [931\nD]\n (b) The impugned rule and the orders are related to\nthis constitutional mandate. Without providing for\nrelaxation of special tests for a temporary period it would\nnot have been possible to give adequate promotion to the\nLower Division Clerks belonging to the Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes to the posts of Upper Division Clerks. The\ntemporary relaxation of test qualification made in favour of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is warranted by\ntheir inadequate representation in the services and their\noverall backwardness. The classification of the members of\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes made under r. 13AA\nis within the purview of constitutional mandate under \nArt.\n335\n in consideration of their claims to redress imbalance in\npublic service and to bring, about parity in the communities\nin the. public services. [931H; 932A-B]\n (10) Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are not a\ncaste within the ordinary meaning of castes. [932 E]\n Bhaiyalal v. Harikishan Singh and Ors. [1965] 2 S.C.R.\n877, referred to\n (11)(a) our Constitution aims at equality of status and\nopportunity for all citizens including those who are\nsocially, economically and educationally backward. The\nclaims of members of backward classes require adequate\nrepresentation in legislative and executive bodies. If\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are\nsaid by this Court to be backward classes, can maintain\nminimum necessary requirement of administrative efficiency,\nnot only representation but also preference may be given to\nthem to enforce equality and to eliminate inequality. [932G-\nH]\n (b) Equality of opportunity for unequals can only mean\naggravation of inequality. Equality of opportunity admits\ndiscrimination with reason and prohibits discrimination\nwithout reason. Preferential representation for the backward\nclasses in services with due regard to administrative\nefficiency is a permissible object and backward classes are\na rational classification recognised by the Constitution.\nTherefore, differential treatment in standards of selection\nis within the concept of equality. [933B-C]\n (c) The rule in the present case does not impair the\ntest of efficiency in administration inasmuch a., members of\nScheduled Castes and Tribes who are promoted have to acquire\nthe qualification of passing the test. The only relaxation\nwhich is done in their case is that they are granted two\nyears more time than others to acquire the qualification.\n[933 D]\n (12) (a) Equal protection of laws necessarily involves\nclassification. The validity of the classification must be\nadjusted with reference to the purpose of the law. [933 G]\n (b) The classification in the present case is justified\nbecause the purpose of classification is to enable members\nof Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to find\nrepresentation by promotion to a limited extent From the\npoint of view of time a differential treatment is given to\nmembers of Scheduled Castes and Tribes for the purpose of\ngiving them equality consistent with efficiency. [933 H]\n (13) The High Court was wrong in basing its conclusion\nthat the result of application of the impeached rule and the\norders is excessive and exorbitant. The promotions made in\nservices as a whole are nowhere near 50% of the total number\nof posts. It is correct that r. 13AA and the orders are\nmeant to implement not only the direction under \nArt. 335\n but\nalso the directive principle under \nArt. 46.\n [932C-D]\n909\n Per Mathew, J.\n (1) The concept of equality of opportunity is an aspect\nof the more comprehensive notion of equality. The idea of\nequality has different shades of meaning and connotations.\nIt has many facets and implications. [948 A]\n (2) The notion of equality of opportunity has meaning\nonly when a limited number of posts as in the present case\nshould be allocated on grounds which do not a priori exclude\nany section of citizens of those that desire it. A priori\nexclusion means exclusion on grounds other than those\nappropriate or rational for the good in question. The notion\nrequires not merely that there should be no exclusion from\naccess on grounds other than those appropriate or rational\nfor the good in question but the grounds considered\nappropriate for the good should themselves be such that\npeople from all sections of society have an equal chance of\nsatisfying them. [950A-B]\n (3) To give equality of opportunity for employment to\nthe members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, it is\nnecessary to take note of their social, educational and\neconomic environment. Not only is the Directive Principle\nembodied in \nArt. 46\n binding on the law-maker as ordinarily\nunderstood but it should equally inform and illuminate the\napproach of the Court when it makes a decision as the Court\nalso is `State' within the meaning of \nArt. 12\n and makes law\neven though interstitially.

Its existence depends not merely on the\nabsence of disabilities but on the presence of abilities.\n[951 F]\n (5) The guarantee of equality before the law or the\nequal opportunity in matters of employment is a guarantee of\nsomething more than what is required by formal equality. It\nimplies differential treatment of persons who are unequal.\nEgalitarian principle has, therefore. enhanced the growing\nbelief that Government has an affirmative duty to eliminate\ninequalities and to provide opportunities for the exercise\nof human rights and claims. [951 H]\n (6) Fundamental Rights as enacted in Part III of the\nConstitution are, by and large, essentially negative in\ncharacter. They mark off a world it which time Government\nshould have no jurisdiction. In this realm, it was assumed\nthat a citizen has no claim upon Government except to be let\nalone.[952 A]\n (7)(a) But the language of \nArt. 16(1)\n is in marked\ncontrast with that of \nArt. 14.\n Whereas the accent in Art 14\nis on the injunction that the State shall not deny to any\nperson equality before the law or the equal protection of\nthe laws, that is, on the negative character of the duty of\nthe State, the emphasis in \nArt. 16(1)\n is on the mandatory\naspect. [952 B]\n (b) If equality of opportunity guaranteed under \nArt.\n16(1)\n means effective material equality, then \nArt. 16(4)\n is\nnot an exception to \nArt. 16(1).\n It is only all emphatic way\nof putting the extent in which equality of opportunity could\nbe carried namely even upto the point of making reservation.\n[956]\n (c) \nArt. 16(1)\n is only a part of a comprehensive scheme\nto ensure equality in all spheres.

Moreover, though the\nmembers of tribe might be included in Scheduled Castes,\ntribe as such is not mentioned in \nArticle 16(2).\n [957 A]\n (e) \nArticle 16(1)\n and Art 16(2) do not prohibit the\nprescription of a reasonable qualification for appointment\nor for promotion. Any provision as to qualification for\nemployment or appointment to are office reasonably fixed and\napplicable to all would be consistent with the doctrine of\nequality of opportunity under \nArt. 16(1).\n [957 E]\n The General Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n[1962] 3.S.C.R. 586 referred to\n (8) Today, the sense that Government has affirmative\nresponsibility for elimination of inequalities, social,\neconomic or otherwise, is one of the dominant forces in\nconstitutional law. [952 E]\n (9) The concept of equality of opportunity in matters\nof employment is wide enough to include within it\ncompensatory measures to put the members of the Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes on par with the members of other\ncommunities which would enable them to get their share of\nrepresentation in public service. [954 E]\n (10) If reservation is necessary either at the initial\nstage or at the stage of promotion or at both to ensure for\nthe members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\nequality of opportunity in the matter of employment. there\nis no reason why that is not permissible under \nArt. 16(1)\n as\nthat alone might put them on a parity with the forward\ncommunities in the matter of achieving the result which\nequality of opportunity would produce. Equality of result is\nthe test of equality of opportunity. [954 G-H]\n (11) The State can adopt any measure which would ensure\nthe adequate representation in public service of the members\nof the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and justify it\nas a compensatory measure to ensure equality of opportunity\nprovided the measure does not dispense with the acquisition\nof the minimum basic qualification necessary for the\nefficiency of administration.[956 D]\n (12) It is a mistake to assume a priori that there can\nbe no classification within a class, say, the Lower Division\nClerks. If there are intelligible differentia which separate\na group within that class from the rest and that differentia\nhave nexus with the object of classification, there is no\nobjection to a further classification within the class. [957\nC]\n All India Station Masters and Assistant Station Masters\nAssociation v. General Manager Central Railway and others\n[1960] 2 S.C.R. 311, S. C. Jaisingjamoi v.

Triloki Nath Khosa & others [1974] 1 S.C.R. 771\nheld inapplicable.\n (13) In the instant case Rule 13AA has been enacted not\nwith the idea of dispensing with the minimum qualification\nrequired for promotion to a higher category or class, but\nonly to give enough breathing space to enable the members of\nSeheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to acquire it. The\npurpose of the classification made in r. 13AA is to enable\nthem to have their due claim of representation in the higher\ncategory without sacrificing the efficiency implicit in the\npassing of the test. [958 B]\n (14) The classification made in r. 13AA has a\nreasonable nexus with the purpose of the law. Rule 13AA is\nnot intended to give permanent exemption to the members of\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from passing the test\nbut only reasonable time to enable to them to do so. That\nthe power is liable to be abused is no reason to hold that\nthe rule itself is bad. [958 E]\n911\nPer Beg J.\n The only ground given by the High Court for refusing to\ngive the benefits of the impugned rules and orders to the\nbackward class Government servants, that they fall outside\nthe purview of \nArt. 16(4)\n was not substantiated. The\nrespondent has not discharged the burden establishing a\nconstitutionally unwarranted discrimination against him.\n[963 H]\n (1) When citizens are already employed in a particular\n grade as government servant considerations relating to the\n sources from which they were drawn lose much of their\n importance. Neither as members of a single class nor for\n purposes of equality of opportunity which is to be afforded\n to this class does the fact that some of them also members\n of economically and socially backward class continue to be\nmaterial or, even relevant. Their entry into the me relevant\n class as others must be deemed to indicate that they no\n longer suffer from the handicaps of a backward class. For\n purposes of Government service the source from which they\n are drawn should cease to matter. As Government servants.\nthey would form only one class for the purpose of promotion.\n [960A-B]\n (2) (a) The specified and express mode of realisation\nof the objects contained in \nArt. 16(4)\n, must exclude the\npossibility of the methods which could be implied and read\ninto \nArt. 16(1)\n for securing them in this field the\napplicable maxim being `expressio unius est exclusio\nalterius\". [960 H]\n (2) (b) The purpose of equality of opportunity by means\nof tests is only to ensure a fair competition in securing\nposts and promotions in Government service, and not the\nremoval of causes for unequal performances in competitions\nfor these posts or promotions. [960 H]\n (3) \nArticle 16(4)\n is designed to reconcile the\nconflicting pulls of \nArt. 16 (1)\n representing the dynamics\nof justice conceived of as equality in conditions under\nwhich candidates actually compete for posts in Government\nservice and of Arts. 46 and 355 embodying the duties of the\nState to promote the interests of the economically\neducationally and socially backward so as to release them\nfrom the clutches of social injustice. These encroachments\non the field of \nArt. 16(1)\n can only be permitted to the\nextent they are warraned by \nArt. 16(4).\n To read broader\nconcepts of social justice and equality into \nArt. 16(1)\n may\nstultify this provision and make \nArt. 16(4)\n otiose. [961C-D]\n (4) It would be dangerous to extend the limits of\nprotection against the operation of the principle of\nequality of opportunity in this field beyond its express\nconstitutional authorisation by \nArt. 16(4).\n [959 G]\n (5) But if the impugned rules and orders could be\nviewed as an implementation of a policy of qualified or\npartial or conditional reservation which could satisfy the\nrequirements of substantial equality in keeping with \nArt.\n335\n and meet the demands of equality and justice looked from\nthe point of view of \nArt. 46\n of the Constitution, they could\nalso be justified under \nArt. 16(4)\n of the Constitution. [963\nB-C]\n (6) Though the respondent was not promoted in spite of\npassing the efficiency test earlier the backward class\nemployees who were given preference over him, were\ndischarging their duties in the higher grade quite\nsatisfactorily and were his seniors in service. Taking and\npassing of a written test earlier than another employee\ncould not be the sole factor to consider in deciding upon a\nclaim to superiority or to preference on grounds of merit\nand efficiency for promotion as a government servant. [962A-\nB]\n (7) The effect of the relaxation is that a backward\nclass employee continues in the post temporarily for a\nlonger period before being either confirmed or reverted. For\nthis period, the post remains reserved for him. If he does\nnot satisfy the efficiency tests even within the extended\nperiod he has to revert to the lower grade. If he does\nsatisfy the special efficiency tests. in this extended\nperiod. he is confirmed in the class of promotees into which\nhe obtained entry because of a reservation. One of the\ndictionary meanings of the word\n912\n`reserve' is \"to keep back or hold over to a later time or\nplace for further treatment etc.\" The result of the rule\ntherefore is a kind of reservation.\n (8) If reservation of posts under Art 16(4) for\nemployees of backward classes could include complete\nreservation of higher posts to which they could he promoted,\nthere is no reason why it could not be partial or for a part\nof the duration of service and hedged round with the\ncondition that a temporary. promotion would operate as a\ncomplete and confirmed promotion only if the temporary\npromotee satisfies some tests within a given time. [963 A]\n In the instant cases apart from the fact that it is\nonly one of partial or temporary and conditional\nreservation, it is disputed here that the favoured class of\nemployees constituted more than 50% of the total number of\nGovernments servants of this class (Clerks) if the overall\nposition is taken into account. Furthermore, a large number\nof temporary promotions of backward class Government\nservants of this grade had taken place in 1972 in the\nDepartment because promotions of this class of employees had\nbeen held up in the past due to want of necessary provision\nin the rules. The totality of facts of this case to want of\nnecessary provision in the rules. The totality of facts of\nthis case is distinguishable in their effects from those in\nT. Devadasan v.

A Lower\nDivision Clerk who is a member of the Scheduled Caste or the\nScheduled Tribe could not be promoted without passing any\ntest at all so as to destroy the concept of equality. It\nmerely gives a special concession or a temporary relaxation\nto cockward class of citizens in order to lift them, advance\nthem and enable them to compete with the stronger sections\nof the society. Thus, the basis of the rule is undoubtedly\nboth rational and reasonable. The rule does not grant\ncomplete exemption to the promotees from passing the test.\nIt only provides for grant of extension of time to enable\nthem to clear the test. It cannot, therefore be held that\nthe State's action in incorporating rule 13AA. in any way\nviolates the mandate contained in \nArt. 335.\n The concession\ngiven in Rule 13AA amounts to a reasonable classification\nwhich can be made under \nArt. 16(1)\n and does not amount to\nthe selection of the respondent no. 1 for hostile\ndiscrimination so as to be violative of \nArt. 16(1)\n of the\nConstitution. Respondent no. 1 passed the test necessary for\npromotion to the Upper Grade on November 2. 1971. He cannot\nput forward his claim for being promoted earlier than that\ndate. Extensions granted by the Government to the clerks\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribes from 1958 to\n1972 and thereafter upto 1974 will affect respondent no. 1\nonly after November 2, 1971 and not before that date. [1001\nC; F-G; 990 DE]\n (7) If the carry forward rule is not upheld then\nbackwardness will be perpetrated and it would result\nultimately in a vacuum. The High Court was in error in\nholding that the State's action in filling 34 vacancies out\nof 51 by members of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes was\nillegal and could not be justified. [1006 C]\n (8) A concession or relaxation in favour of a backward\nclass of citizens particularly when they are senior in\nexperience would not amount to any impairment of efficiency.\nThe High Court was in error in holding that Rule 13AA was\nultra vires and was violative of \nArt. 16\n as it thought that\nthis rule came within the mischief of clause 4 of Art, 16.\n[1006 D-E]\n Per Khanna, J.

It was also plain that because of their\nbackwardness those sections of the population would not be\nin a position to compete with advanced sections of the\ncommunity who had all the advantages of affluence and better\neducation. The fact that the doors of competition were open\nto them would have been a poor consolation to the members of\nthe backward classes because the chances of their success in\nthe competition were far too remote on account of the\ninherent handicap and disadvantage from which they suffered.\nThe result would have been that, leaving aside some\nexceptional cases, the members of backward classes would\nhave hardly got any representation in jobs requiring\neducational background. It would have thus resulted in\nvirtually repressing those who were already repressed. The\nframers of the Constitution being conscious of the above\ndisadvantage from which backward classes were suffering\nenjoined upon the State in \narticle 46\n of the Constitution to\npromote with special care educational and economic interests\nof the weaker sections of the people, in particular of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and also protect them\nfrom social injustice and all forms of exploitation. To give\neffect to that objective in the field of public employment,\na provision was made in clause (4) of \narticle 16\n that\nnothing in that article would prevent the State from making\nany provision for the reservation of appointments or posts\nin favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the\nopinion of the State, was not adequately represented in the\nservices under the State. Under the above clause, it is\npermissible for the State, in case it finds the\nrepresentation of any backward class of citizens in the\nState services to be not adequate, to make provision for the\nreservation of appointments or posts in favour of that\nbackward class of citizens. The reservation of seats for the\nmembers of the backward classes was not, however, to be at\nthe cost of efficiency. This fact was brought out in \narticle\n335\n,"

The reason for the\nclassification \nin that case\n was that the higher echelons of\nthe service should be filled by experienced officers\npossessing not only a high degree of ability but also first-\nrate experience.\n \nIn the case of \nTriloki Nath Khosa\n (supra)\nthe question before the Court was with regard to the\nvalidity of a rule which provided that only those assistant\nengineers would be eligible for promotion as executive\nengineers who possessed a degree in engineering. The\nvalidity of this rule was challenged by assistant engineers\nwho were diploma-holders and did not possess the degree in\nengineering. This Court held that though persons appointed\ndirectly and by promotion were integrated into a common\nclass of assistant engineers, they could for purposes of\npromotion to the cadre of executive engineers be classified\non the basis of educational qualifications. The rule\nproviding that graduates shall be eligible for such\npromotion to the exclusion of diploma-holders was held to be\nnot violative of \narticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. It\nwould thus appear that in each of the above cases the Court\nwas concerned with two categories of employees, each one of\nwhich category constituted a separate and distinct class.\nDifferential treatment for those classes was upheld in the\ncontext of their educational and other qualifications and\nbecause of the fact that they constituted distinct and\nseparate classes. Not much argument is needed to show that a\nrule requiring that an official must possess a degree in\nengineering before he can be promoted to the post of\nexecutive engineer is conceived in the interest of\nefficiency of service. A classification based upon that\nconsideration is obviously valid. Likewise, classification\nbased upon the consideration that one category of employees\nare direct recruits while others are promotes, is\npermissible classification because the two categories of\nemployees constitute two separate and distinct classes. The\nsame is true of roadside station masters and guards.\nClassification of employees in each of these cases was\nlinked with the nature of their initial employment or\neducational qualifications and had nothing to do with the\nfact that they belonged to any particular section of the\npopulation. A classification based upon the first two\nfactors was upheld because it was conceived in the interest\nof efficiency of service and because they constituted two\ndifferent classes in view of the fact that they were\ninitially appointed to posts of different categories. Such\nclassification does not impinge upon the rule of equality of\nopportunity. As against that, a classification based upon\nthe consideration that an employee belongs to a particular\nsection of the population with a view to accord preferential\ntreatment for promotion is clear violation of equality of\nopportunity enshrined in clause (1) of \narticle 16.\n In no\ncase has the Court ever accepted and upheld under \narticle\n16(1)\n classification and differential treatment for the\npurpose of promotion among employees who possessing the same\neducational qualifications were initially appointed as in\nthe present case to the same category of posts, viz., that\nof lower division clerks.\n \nThe present case falls squarely\nwithin the dictum \nlaid down in\n the case of \nStation Masters'\n& Asstt.

Or, indeed as was said\nof another age by Anatole France, 'The law in its majestic\nequality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under\nbridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread'.\nRedistributive justice to harijan humanity insists on\neffective reforms, designed to produce equal partnership of\nthe erstwhile 'lowliest and the lost', by State action,\ninformed by short-run and long-run sociologically potent\nperspective planning and implementation. An uneven socio-\neconomic landscape hardly gives the joy or equal opportunity\nand development or draw forth their best from manpower\nresources now wallowing in the low visibility areas of\ndiscontented life."

The plea of respondent No. 1 appears\nto have found favour with the High Court which held that r.\n13-A.A. was discriminatory and was clearly violative of \nArt.\n16(1)\n of the Constitution and was also beyond the\nreservation permitted by clause (4) of \nArt. 16."

It is, therefore, manifest\nthat whatever grievance the respondent No. 1 may have\nagainst the other clerks, he cannot put forward his claim\nfor being promoted earlier than November 2, 1971 i.e. before\nthe time he passed the test. In these circumstances\nextensions granted by the Government to the clerks belonging\nto the scheduled castes or tribes from 1958 to 1972 and\nthereafter upto 1974 will affect the respondent No. 1 only\nafter November 2, 1971 and not before that. Secondly it is\nalso not denied that the Lower Division Clerks belonging to\nthe scheduled castes and tribes were undoubtedly senior to\nthe respondent No. 1 and had been promoted on the express\ncondition that unless they passed the test prescribed by the\nGovernment they would have to be reverted. This was\nobviously done to advance and lift the members of the\nscheduled castes and tribes who were backward class of\ncitizens so that they may be able to compete with the other\nstronger sections of the society. It may also be mentioned\nhere that the promotees were not completely exempted from\nthe test but they were given extension of time for passing\nthe test. Thus it is obvious that but for the passing of the\ntest the respondent No. 1 could not have any other claim to\npromotion as Upper Division Clerk. The respondent No. 1 was\npreviously serving as a Lower Division Clerk in the\nRegistration Department at Kottayam but is at present\nserving in Chitty Auditor's Office at Kottayam. Lastly it is\nalso admitted that the promotees against whom the respondent\nNo. 1 has a grievance were undoubtedly members of the\nscheduled castes or tribes and such Lower Division Clerks\nbelonging to the scheduled castes or tribes will hereafter\nbe referred as 'the promotees' for the purpose of brevity."

In other words, the idea of classification\nis implicit in the concept of equality because equality\nmeans equality to all and not merely to the advanced and\neducated sections of the society. It follows, therefore,\nthat in order to provide equality of opportunity to all\ncitizens of our country, every class of citizens must have a\nsense of equal participation in building up an egalitarian\nsociety, where there is peace and plently, where there is\ncomplete economic freedom and there is no pestilence or\npoverty, no discrimination and oppression, where there is\nequal opportunity to education, to work, to earn their\nlivelihood so that the goal of social justice is achieved.\nCould we, while conferring benefits on the stronger and the\nmore advanced sections of the society, ignore the more\nbackward classes merely because they cannot come upto the\nfixed standards ? Such a course, in my opinion, would lead\nto denial of opportunity to the backward classes resulting\nin complete annihilation of the concept of equality\ncontained in Arts. 14 and 16. The only manner in which the\nobjective of equality as contemplated by the founding\nfathers of our Constitution and as enshrined in Arts. 14 and\n16 can be achieved is to boost up the backward classes by\ngiving them concessions, relaxations, facilities, removing\nhandicaps, and making suitable reservations so that the\nweaker sections of the people may compete with the more\nadvanced and in due course of time all may become equals and\nbackwardness is banished for ever. This can happen only when\nwe achieve complete economic and social freedom. In our vast\ncountry where we have diverse races and classes of people,\nsome of whom are drowned in the sea of ignorance and\nilliteracy, the concept of equality assumes very important\nproportions. There are a number of areas in some States like\nKashmir, Sikkim, hilly areas of U.P., Bihar and the South,\nwhere due to lack of communication or transport, absence of\nproper educational facilities or because of old customs and\nconventions and other environmental reasons, the people are\nboth socially and educationally backward. Could we say that\nthe citizens hailing from these areas should continue to\nremain backward merely because they fall short of certain\nartificial standards fixed by various institutions ? The\nanswer must be in the negative. The directive principles\nenshrined in our Constitution contain a clear mandate to\nachieve equality and social justice. Without going into the\nvexed question as to whether or not the directive principles\ncontained in Part IV override the fundamental rights in Part\nIII there appears to be a complete unanimity of judicial\nopinion of this Court that the directive principles and the\nfundamental rights should be construed in harmony with each\nother and every attempt should be made by the Court to\nresolve any apparent inconsistency. The directive principles\ncontained in Part IV constitute the stairs to climb the high\nedifice of a socialistic State and the fundamental rights\nare the means through which one can reach the top of the\nedifice. I am fortified in my view by several decisions of\nthis Court to which I will refer briefly."

It is clear from\nAnnexure 'A' of the Appeal Paper Book that there were as\nmany as 2254 non-gazetted employees in the Registration\nDepartment out of which members of the scheduled castes and\ntribes are only 198.
