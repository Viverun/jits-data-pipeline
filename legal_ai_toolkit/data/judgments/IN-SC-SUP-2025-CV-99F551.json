No. 7248 of 2017.\n\nShri Sanjayram Tamrakar, Senior Advocate with Shri Ankit Chopra,\nAdvocate for the Petitioners in W.P. No. 8399 of 2017.\n\nShri Vivek Sharma, Deputy Advocate General for the Respondent/State.\n\nPronounced on: 06.05.2025\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\nORDER\n\nPer: Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva\n\nW.P. No. 7248/2017\n\n1. Petitioner No. 1 in W.P.No.7248/2017 retired as a judge of the\nSupreme Court of India on 28.06.2008. Thereafter on 29.06.2009, he was\nappointed as the Lokayukt in the State of Madhya Pradesh, from where he\nretired on 28.06.2016.\n\n2. In the Pension Payment Order (PPO for short) issued post the\nretirement of the Petitioner No. 1, there was no provision made for\npayment of family pension to his wife (Petitioner No. 2) and further he\nwas not granted any cash equivalent to the unutilized leave.\n\n3. Petitioners thus filed this petition inter alia seeking a direction to\nthe Respondents to fix the family pension for Petitioner No. 2 (the wife of\nPetitioner No.1) and for a direction to the Respondents to make payment\nof cash equivalent to unutilized leaveon full allowances to the Petitioner\nNo. 1.as aLokayukt of the State of Madhya Pradesh alongwith interest for\ndelayed payment.\n\nW.P. No. 8399/2017\n\n4. Original Petitioner No. 1 in W.P.No.8399/2017 (now deceased),\nretired as a judge of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh on 02.11.2005.\nThereafter he was appointed as Up-Lokayukt on 01.02.2008 of the State\nof Madhya Pradesh, from where he retired on 01.01.2014.\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n5. As in the case of the Petitioner in W.P. 7248 of 2017, in this case\nalso, in the Pension Payment Order (PPO for short) there was no\nprovision made for grant of family pension to the wife of Petitioner No. 1\nand payment of Cash equivalent to the unutilized leave.\n\n6. Petitioners thus filed this petition inter alia seeking a direction to\nthe Respondents to fix the family pension for Petitioner No. 2 (the wife of\nPetitioner No. 1) and for a direction to the Respondents to make payment\nof cash equivalent to unutilized leave on full allowances to the Petitioner\nNo. 1.as Up-Lokayukt of the State of Madhya Pradesh alongwith interest\nfor delayed payment.\n\n7. During pendency of the petition, Petitioner no.1 expired on\n22.08.2018.\n\n8.\nIn both the Writ Petitions, reliance is placed on the case W.P. No.\n13294 of 2007(S) titled\nShyamsunder Chawla versus State of Madhya\nPradesh\nwherein by order dated 03.09.2014, a single judge of this court\nrejected the plea that as the rules were silent so the wife, Respondent No.\n2 would not be entitled to family pension. The Writ Appeal (W.A. 896 of\n2014) impugning\nthe said decision\nwas dismissed on 09.12.2014, holding\nthat as Shri Justice Shyamsunder Chawla was getting additional pension\nas he worked as Deputy Lokayukt and therefore, in the absence of rules\nhis widow could not be deprived of family pension in that regard.\nSubsequently the Special Leave Petition (S.L.P. (Civil) No. 5796 of 2016)\nagainst the order dated 09.12.2014 was dismissed by the Supreme Court\nof India on 15.02.2016 on the ground of delay, however leaving the\nquestion of law open. Thereafter, the Respondents by order dated\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n24.02.2016 fixed the family pension of the wife of Shri Justice\nShyamsunder Chawla.\n\n9. In the present case, the appointment of the respective\nPetitionersNo.1,in both the petitions, to the post of Lokayuktand Up-\nLokayuktrespectively was under the provisions of M.P. Lokayukt Evam\nUp-Lokayukt Adhiniyam, 1981 (herein after referred to as 'the Act').\n\n10. No separate Return was filed by the Respondents in W.P. No.\n8399/2017. They simply adopted the Return filed in W.P. No. 7284 of\n2017. The stand taken by the Respondents is that the family pension for\nrespective PetitionerNo.2 was not fixed because in the Madhya Pradesh\nLokayukt and Up-lokayukt (Conditions of Service) Rules,\n1982(hereinafter referred to as the \"Rules\") there is no mention of grant\nof family pension to the dependent of the Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt in the\nState of Madhya Pradesh and for the benefit to be extended there has to\nbe an explicit and express provision under the rules and in absence\nthereof such relief cannot be granted.\n\n11. With respect to payment of cash equivalent to unutilised leave, the\nstand of the Respondents is that asPetitioners have already availed the\nbenefit of leave encashment of 300 days in their capacity as Judges, in\nview of Rule 6 of the Rules, they are not entitled for any benefit of leave\nencashment for the services rendered as Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt.\nReliance is also placed on the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in\nV.S. Mallimathversus Union of India & another (2001) 4 SCC 31.\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n12. As per the Respondents, during the pendency of these\npetitions,Rules were amended with effect from 25.01.2022 and provision\nfor family pension was inserted in the Rules. A statement was made by\nthe Deputy Advocate General appearing for the State on 05.02.2025 that\nfamily pension had already been fixed and was being paid to\nPetitionerNo.2 of W.P. No.8399/2017 (wife of the Late Petitioner No. 1\nwho expired on 22.08.2018), from the date of amendment i.e. 25.01.2022\nof the Rules. It was further stated that family pension would be payable to\nthe PetitionerNo. 2 of W.P. No.7248/2017 as and when the cause so arises.\n\n13. In view of the statement made on behalf of the State, the grievance\nof the Petitioners of W.P. No.7248/2017 in respect of family pension has\nbeen resolved. In so far as PetitionerNo. 2 of W.P. No.8399/2017 is\nconcerned, the issue still survives as the family pension has only been\npaid to her from the date of amendment of the Rules on 25.01.2022 and\nnot from the date of death of PetitionerNo.1 i.e. 22.08.2018.\n\n14. In so far as the payment of cash equivalent to unutilized leave is\nconcerned, said issue survives in both the petitions.\n\n15. The questions that arise for determination in these petitions are:\n\ni. Whether family pension is payable to the dependent\nfamily member of the Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt from the\ndate of death of the Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt or from the\ndate a specific provision was made in the Madhya\nPradesh Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt (Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1982?\n\nii. Whether the Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt appointed under\nthe M.P. Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt Adhiniyam, 1981\nare entitled to cash equivalent to unutilized leave, even if\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nthey have already availed the benefit of leave encashment\nof 300 days in their capacity as Judges prior to their\nappointment as Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt?\n\n16. To answer the questions that arise for determination in these\npetitions, we need to examine the Act.\n\n17. Appointment of Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt is in terms of Section 3\nof the Act. Section 3(2) of the Act reads as under:\n\n\"3. Appointment of Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt -\n\n(1) *****\n\n(2) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as,-\n\n(a) Lokayukt unless he has been a Judge of the\nSupreme Court or Chief Justice or Judge of any High\nCourt in India.\n\n(b) Up-Lokayukt, unless he is or has been a Judge of\nany High Court in India or has held the Office of the\nSecretary to Government of India or has held any other\npost under Central or a State Government carrying a\nscale of pay which is not less than that of a Additional\nSecretary to Government of India.\n\n(3) ******\"\n\n18. Originally, when the Act was enacted in 1981, Section 3(2)(a) of\nthe Act provided that a person shall not be qualified for appointment as\nLokayukt unless he has been a \"Judge of the Supreme Court of the Chief\nJustice of any High Court in India.\" In 2003 the Act was amended by the\nMP Amendment Act 24 of 2003, to read \"a Judge of the Supreme Court\nor Chief Justice or Judge of any High Court in India.\"\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n19. The Term of office and other conditions of service of Lokayukt and\nUp-Lokayukt are governed by Section 5 of the Act. Section 5 (4) and (5)\nof the Act deals with salaries, allowances and pension payable to and\nother conditions of service of Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt.\n\n20. For answering the questions that have arisen in these petitions it\nwould be expedient to examine the legislative history of the said\nprovisions.\n\n21. When the Act was enacted in 1981, said sub sections read as under:\n\n\"5. Term of office and other conditions of Service of\nLokayukt and Up-Lokayukt.-\n\n(1) *****\n\n***** *****\n(4) There shall be paid to Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt such\nsalaries as are specified in the Second Schedule.\n\n(5) The allowances and pension payable to, and other\nconditions of service of, Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt shall be such\nas may be prescribed:\n\nProvided that,-\n\n(a) in prescribing the allowances and pension payable\nto and other conditions of service of, Lokayukt, regard shall\nbe had to the allowances and pension payable to, one other\nconditions of service of, Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief\nJustice of a High Court;\n\n(b) in prescribing the allowances, and pension payable\nto, and other conditions of service of Up-Lokayukt regard\nshall be had to the allowances and pension payable to, and\nother conditions of service of, a Judge of a High Court or\nSecretary to the Government of India or the Chief Secretary to\na State Government:\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nProvided further that, the allowances and pension payable to,\nand other conditions of service of, Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt shall\nnot be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment.\n\n(6) *****\"\n\n22. Section 5(4) of the Act refers to the Second Schedule. The Second\nSchedule when enacted in 1981, read as under\n\n\"THE SECOND SCHEDULE\n[See section 5(4)]\n\nThere shall be paid to the Lokayukt and the Up-Lokayukt in\nrespect of time spent on actual service, salary at the following\nrates per mensem, that is to say:-\n\nLokayukt 4,000 rupees Plus such perquisites and\nallowancesas were last available to the\nincumbentduring his service.\n\nUp-Lokayukt3,500 rupees Plus such perquisites and allowances\naswere last available to the incumbent duringhis\nservice:\n\nProvided that, if the Lokayukt or an Up-Lokayukt at the time of\nhis appointment is in receipt of a pension (other than a disability\nor wound pension) in respect of any previous service under the\nGovernment of India or any of its predecessor Government or\nunder the Government of a State or any of its predecessor\nGovernments, his salary in respect of service as the Lokayukt or,\nas the case may be, Up-Lokayukt shall be reduced-\n\n(a) by the amount of that pension, and\n\n(b) if he has, before such appointment, received in lieu of a\nportion of the pension due to him in respect of such\nprevious service the commuted value thereof, by the\namount of that portion of the pension, and\n\n(c) if he has, before such appointment, received a retirement\ngratuity in respect of such previous service, by the pension\nequivalent of that gratuity.\"\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n23. In 1985 by the The Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt\n(Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 1985, the Second Schedule was amended\nretrospectively with effect from 14.02.1982 and after amendment it read\nas under:\n\n\"THE SECOND SCHEDULE\n[See section 5 (4)]\n\nAfter appointment there shall be paid to the Lokayukt and Up-\nLokayukt in respect of time spent on actual service, salary at the\nfollowing rates per mensem, that is to say,-\n\nLokayukt - 4,000 rupees plus such perquisites and allowances\nas are payable to-\n\n(i) a Judge of the Supreme Court in case\nLokayukt is appointed from amongst the Judge of\nthe Supreme Court;\n\n(ii) a Chief Justice of a High Court in case\nLokayukt is appointed from amongst Chief Justices\nof High Courts in India.\n\nUp-Lokayukt -3,500 rupees plus such perquisites and\nallowances as are payable to-\n\n(i) a Judge of any High Court in India in case\nUp-Lokayukt is appointed from amongst the Judges\nof any High Court;\n\n(ii) a Secretary to the Government of India in\ncase Up-Lokayukt is appointed from amongst the\nSecretaries to the Government of India;\n\n(iii) a Chief Secretary to a State Government in\ncase Up-Lokayukt is appointed from amongst Chief\nSecretaries of State Governments;\n\nProvided that, if the Lokayukt or an Up-Lokayukt at time\nof his appointment is in receipt of a pension (other than a\ndisability or wound pension) in respect of any previous\nservice under the Government of India or any of its\npredecessor Government or under the Government of a\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nState or any of its predecessor Governments, his salary in\nrespect of service as the Lokayukt or, as the case may be,\nUp-Lokayukt, shall be reduced-\n\n(a) by the amount of that pension; and\n\n(b) if he has, before such appointment, received in lieu\n\nof a portion of the pension due to him in respect of\nsuch previous service the commuted value thereof,\nby the amount of that portion of the pension; and\n\n(c) if he has, before such appointment, received a\nretirement gratuity in respect of such previous\nservice, by the pension equivalent of that gratuity.\"\n\n24. By the The Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt\n(Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 1988, theamounts \"4,000 rupees and 3,500\nrupees\" were enhanced to \"9,000 rupees and 8,000 rupees\" respectively\nwith effect from 01.04.1986.\n\n25. Subsequently by The Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt Evam Up-\nLokayukt (Sanshodhan) Adhiniyam, 2004, subsection (4) and (5) was\nsubstituted, with effect from 01.01.1996, as under:\n\n\"(4) The salary, allowances, pension and other perquisites\npayable to and other conditions of the service of Lokayukta shall\nbe same as are admissible to him before his appointment as\ncontained in the\nSupreme Court Judges (Conditions of Service)\nAct, 1958\n(No.41 of 1958), or the\nHigh Court Judges (Conditions\nof Service) Act, 1954\n(No.28 of 1954) and the rules made under\nthe aforesaid Acts as the case may be.\n\n(5) The salary, allowances, pension and other perquisites payable\nto and other conditions of the service of Up-Lokayukta shall be\nsame as are admissible to a sitting Judge of a High Court as\ncontained in the\nHigh Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act,\n(No. 28 of 1954) and rules made there under.\n\nProvided that, if the Lokayukt or an Up-Lokayukt at the time of\nhis appointment is in receipt of a pension (other than a disability\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nor wound pension) in respect of any previous service, his salary\nin respect of service as the Lokayukt or, as the case may be, Up-\nLokayukt shall be reduced-\n\n(a) by the amount of that pension, and\n\n(b) if he has, before such appointment, received in lieu of a\nportion of the pension due to him in respect of such previous\nservice the commuted value thereof, by the amount of that portion\nof the pension.\"\n\n26. In both the petitions we are concerned with the provisions as\namended by the 2004\nAmending Act\n. In terms of the Act as amended by\nthe 2004\nAmending Act\n, the salary, allowances, pension and other\nperquisites payable to and other conditions of the service of Lokayuktare\nthe same as admissible to him before his appointment as contained in the\n\nSupreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958\n\n(No. 41 of 1958), or the\nHigh Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1954\n(No.28 of 1954) and the rules made under the aforesaid\nActs, as the case may be.\n\n27. The salary, allowances, pension and other perquisites payable to\nand other conditions of the service of Up-Lokayuktare the same as are\nadmissible to a sitting Judge of a High Court as contained in the\nHigh\nCourt Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954\n(No. 28 of\n1954) and rules made there under.\n\n28. The contention on behalf of the State, to deny Family Pension, is\nthat the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt (Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1982, did not provide for grant of family pension and as\nsuch, same did not fine mention in the PPO issued to the Petitioner No. 1\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nin WP 8399 of 2017 and as the Rules were amended on 25.01.2022\nspecifically providing for Family Pension, same has been paid to\nPetitioner No. 2 (wife of Late Petitioner No. 1).\n\n29. The Proviso to\nSection 5\nof the Act prior to the amendment by the\nAmending Act\n, stipulated that in prescribing the allowances and\npension payable to and other conditions of service of Lokayukt and Up-\nLokayuktregard shall be had to the allowances and pension payable to,\nand other conditions of service of, Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief\nJustice of a High Court or a Judge of a High Court or Secretary to the\nGovernment of India or the Chief Secretary to a State Government as the\ncase may be.\n\n30.\nSection 17\nof the Act inter alia empowers the Governor to make\nrules for the purposes of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act.\nThe Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt (Conditions of Service)\nRules, 1982 states that \"In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-\nsection (1) of\nSection 17\nread with sub-section (5) 5 of the Madhya\nPradesh Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt Adhiniyam 1981 (No. 37 of 1981)\nthe Government of Madhya Pradesh here by makes the following rules\nregulating the allowances, pension and other conditions of service of\nLokayukt and Up-Lokayukt, namely:-......\"\n\n31. After the amendment by the 2004 Amendment Act,\nSection 5(4)\n\nand (5) of the Act provides that the salary, allowances, pension and other\nperquisites payable to and other conditions of the service of Lokayuktshall\nbe same as are admissible to him before his appointment as contained in\nthe\nSupreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n(No. 41 of 1958), or the\nHigh Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1954\n(No.28 of 1954) and the rules made under the aforesaid\nActs as the case may be and for Up-Lokayukt as are admissible to a\nsitting Judge of a High Court as contained in the\nHigh Court Judges\n(Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954\n(No. 28 of 1954) and rules\nmade there under.\n\n32.\nSection 5(4)\nand (5) of the Act, prior to its amendment by the 2004\n\nAmending Act\n, provided that the allowances and pension payable to, and\nother conditions of service shall be such as may be prescribed. Said\nprovision was amended and the power to prescribe has been deleted and\nsubstituted by the\nSupreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act\n, 1958and the\nHigh Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1954\nand the rules framed thereunder.\n\n33. There is no merit in the contention on behalf of the State. There is a\nclear legislative shift in 2004; from the power of the Governor to\nprescribe the allowances and pension payable to, and other conditions of\nservice,; to being regulated entirely by the\nSupreme Court Judges\n(Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958\n, or the\nHigh Court Judges\n(Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954\nand the rules made under\nthe aforesaid Acts.\n\n34. Chapter III (Sections 12 A to\nSection 21\n) of\nThe Supreme Court\nJudges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act\n, 1958provide for Salaries\nand Pensions. Section 16A provides for Family Pension and gratuity and\nreads as under:\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\"16A.

Similarly, Chapter III (\nSections 13 A\nto\nSection 21\n) of\nThe High\nCourt Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954\nprovide for\nSalaries and Pensions.\nSection 17A\nprovides for Family Pension and\ngratuity and reads as under:\n\n\"17A.

The contention on behalf of the State is clearly not acceptable.\nParticularly after the amendment to the Act in 2004. Prior to the\namendment in 2004, the allowances and pension payable to, and other\nconditions of service were to be as may be prescribed. However, by the\n2004 amendment there is a shift from what could be prescribed to what is\nstipulated in the Supreme CourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1958 and the High CourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1954 and the rules framed thereunder.\n\n37. Thus the State cannot now rely upon the Rules to regulate the\nallowances and pension payable to, and other conditions of Service of the\nLokayukt and Up-Lokayukt. The allowances and pension payable to, and\nother conditions of Service of the Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt are the\nsame as prescribed under the\nSupreme Court Judges (Salaries and\nConditions of Service) Act, 1958\n, or the\nHigh Court Judges (Salaries and\nConditions of Service) Act, 1954\n, as the case may be.\n\n38. However, it is debatable as to whether prior to the 2004\namendment, the allowances and pension payable to Lokayukt and Up-\nLokayukt could be prescribed by the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and Up-\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nlokayukt (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1982 lowerthan what was\nstipulated by the Supreme CourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1958 and the High CourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of\nService) Act, 1954because\nSection 5 (4)\nand\n5 (5)\nof the Act mandated\nthat regard shall be had to the allowances and pension payable to, and\nother conditions of service of, Judge of the Supreme Court or Chief\nJustice of a High Court or a Judge of a High Court.\n\n39. Even if the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt\n(Conditions of Service) Rules, 1982 did not contain a stipulation for\nFamily Pension, whether it could be denied,in view of the same being\nspecifically provided by the Supreme CourtJudges (Salaries and\nConditions of Service) Act, 1958 and the High CourtJudges (Salaries and\nConditions of Service) Act, 1954 is also debatable.However, in the\npetitions at hand, said question does not arise for consideration as the\nPetitioner No. 1 in both the Petitions were appointed respectively as\nLokayukt and Up-Lokayukt after the 2004 amendment.\n\n40. Therefore, in respect of W.P. 8399 of 2017, in terms of the 2004\namendment, Family Pension would be payable to Petitioner No. 2, in\nterms of Section 17A of the High CourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions\nof Service) Act, 1954. Thus, it is held that Petitioner No. 2 is entitled to\nFamily Pension from the date of death of Petitioner No. 1 on 22.08.2018\nand not from the date of amendment of the Rules on 25.01.2022.\n\n41. In view of the above, in respect of question No. 1 \"Whether family\npension is payable to the dependent family member of the Lokayukt and\nUp-lokayukt from the date of death of the Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt or\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nfrom the date a specific provision was made in the Madhya Pradesh\nLokayukt and Up-lokayukt (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1982?\", it is\nheld that after the 2004 amendment of the Act, Family Pension is payable\nto the dependent family member of the Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt from\nthe date of death of the Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt, and not from the date\na specific provision was made in the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and Up-\nlokayukt (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1982. The question as to what\nwould be the position prior to the 2004 amendment is left open.\n\n42. Coming to the question of entitlement of cash equivalent to\nunutilized leave.\n\n43. Respondents have contended that as Petitioners have already\navailed the benefit of leave encashment of 300 days in their capacity as\nJudges they are not entitled for any benefit of leave encashment for the\nservices rendered as Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt. Reliance is placed on\nRule 6 of the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and Up-lokayukt (Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1982 to contend that proviso to the said rule stipulates:\n\n\"Provided that the earned leave encashed by the Lokayukt or Up-\nLokayukt under this sub-rule together with any amount of leave encashed\nearlier during the tenure of his service shall not exceed the limit of 300\ndays.\"\n\n44. Reliance had been placed by the learned counsel for the\nRespondent on Rule 6 of the Rules as it was originally enacted in 1982.\nHowever said rule has been amended inter aliain the years 1989 and 1995\nand the period has been reduced to 240 days.\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n45. The amended Rule 6 as it stood after the 1995 amendment and as\napplicable to the present cases reads as under:\n\n\"6. Leave:\n\n(1) The Lokayukt and the Up-Lokayukt shall he entitled to\nearned leave on full allowance upto 1/11th of the period spent on\nduty:\n\nProvided that they shall cease to earn such leave when the\nearned leave due amounts to [240 days:] [Substituted by\nNotification No. F. 4(3) 89-XLIX-10, dated 20-7-1989.]\n\nProvided further that the Up-Lokayukt, who at the time of his\nappointment as Up-Lokayukt was in the service of the Central or\na State Government, the leave standing to his credit on the date\nof his appointment as Up-Lokayukt shall be carried forward and\nhe may avail of such leave during his tenure as Up-Lokayukt.\n\n(2) The maximum earned leave that may be granted at any\none time shall be [150 days] [Substituted by Notification No. F.\n4(3) 89-XLIX-10, dated 20-7-1989.].\n\n[(2-A) Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt shall be entitled to\ncasual leave of fifteen days in a year.] [Inserted by Notification\nNo. F. 4(3) 89-XLIX-10, dated 20-7-1989.]\n\n(3) In the matter of all other types of leave the Lokayukt and\nthe Up-Lokayukt shall be governed by the rules and practices\napplicable to the Chief Justice and the other Judges of the High\nCourt.\n\n(4) [The Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt shall be entitled to cash\nequivalent of leave salary in respect of the period of earned leave\nat their credit on the date of retirement subject to a maximum of\n240 days :Provided that the earned leave encashed by the\nLokayukt or Up-Lokayukt under this sub-rule together with any\namount of leave encashed earlier during the tenure of his service\nshall not exceed the limit of 240 days.] [Substituted by\nNotification No. F-15-95-1-(10), dated 26-8-1995.]\n\n(5) If in public interest or due to exigencies of public service,\nthe Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt is refused leave preparatory to\nretirement, he shall for the hardship caused by such refusal, be\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\ngranted compensation for leave so refused up to maximum of 120\ndays of leave refused and such compensation determined in\nmanner\nlaid down in\nsub-rule (6) shall be paid to the Lokayukt or\nUp-Lokayukt as the case may be, in as nearly as possible, equal\nmonthly instalments, not exceeding four.\n\n(6)(a) The compensation referred to in sub-rule (5) shall be\ncomputed in the first place calculating separately:-\n\n(i) amount of leave salary that the Lokayukt would\nhave drawn, if the leave had not been refused; and\n\n(ii) the pension (inclusive of the pension equivalent of\ngratuity) to which Lokayukt or as the case may be,\nUp-Lokayukt is entitled from the date of vacation of\noffice, for a period equivalent to the period of leave\nrefused.\n\n(b) The total amount of pension referred to in item (ii) of\nclause (a) shall next he deducted from the total amount of\nleave salary referred to in para (i) of clause (a) and the\nbalance shall be the amount of compensation payable to\nunder sub-rule (5) to the Lokayukt or to the Up-Lokayukt,\nas the case may be.\"\n\n46. Though, we are unable to accept the contention of learned Deputy\nAdvocate General for the State that the period eligible for leave\nencashment would be restricted to 300 days by the Rules, however, for\ndifferent reasons as discussed hereinafter, we hold that the period would\nbe restricted to 300 days.\n\n47. The judgment in the case of V.S. Mallimath (supra) relied upon by\nlearned Deputy Advocate General has no applicability to the facts of the\npresent case, in view of different statutory provisions applicable. In V.S.\nMallimath (supra) the Supreme Court was considering the\nProtection of\nHuman Rights Act, 1993\nand the National Human Rights Commission\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nChairperson and Members (Salaries Allowances and Other Conditions of\nService) Rules, 1993, which have different statutory provisions.\n\n48. As has been held hereinabove, that after the amendment of the Act\nin 2004, the allowances and pension payable to, and other conditions of\nservice would be entirely governed by what is stipulated in the Supreme\nCourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958 and the High\nCourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 and the rules\nframed thereunder.\n\n49. Reference may be had to the\nSupreme Court Judges (Salaries and\nConditions of Service) Act, 1958\n, which in Rule 4A provides for leave\nencashment and reads as under:\n\n\"4A. Leave encashment.―A Judge shall be entitled in his entire\nservice, including the period of service rendered either as a\nJudge of a High Court or in a pensionable post under the Union\nor a State or on re-employment, if any, to claim the cash\nequivalent of leave salary on his retirement in respect of the\nperiod of leave at his credit, calculated on full allowances basis,\nto the extent of the maximum period prescribed for encashment of\nsuch leave under the All India Service (Leave) Rules, 1955.\"\n\n(underlining supplied)\n\n50. The CorrespondingRule 4 A of the\nHigh Court Judges (Salaries and\nConditions of Service) Act\n, 1954reads as under:\n\n\"4A. Leave encashment.--A Judge shall be entitled in his entire\nservice, including the period of service rendered in a pensionable\npost under the Union or State or on re-employment, if any, to\nclaim the cash equivalent of leave salary on his retirement in\nrespect of the period of leave at his credit, calculated on full\nallowances basis, to the extent of the maximum period prescribed\nfor encashment of such leave under the All India Service (Leave)\nRules, 1955.\"\n\n(underlining supplied)\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n51. Both the Acts refer to the maximum period prescribed for\nencashment of such leave under the All India Service (Leave) Rules, 1955.\nThe All India Service (Leave) Rules besides prescribing for various types\nof rules that are admissible, in Rule 20A provides for Payment of cash\nequivalent of leave salary in case of retirement or death. Said Rule reads\nas under:\n\n\"20A. Payment of cash equivalent of leave salary in case of\nretirement or death.--\n\n(1) Where a member of the Service retires from the service,\nwhether on attaining the age of superannuation under sub-rule(1)\nof rule 15 or sub-rule(2), (2A) or (3) of rule 16, of the All India\nServices (Death-cum-Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 or dies,\nthe Government shall suo-motu sanction to him or his family, as\nthe case may be, cash equivalent of leave salary in respect of\nboth earned leave and half pay leave, if any, standing in his\ncredit on the date on which he ceases to be member of the Service\nsubject to a maximum of 300 days and pay the same in lumpsum\nas a onetime settlement. The cash equivalent shall be equal to the\nleave salary as admissible for earned leave and /or equal to the\nleave salary as admissible for half pay leave plus dearness\nallowance admissible on the leave salary for the first 300 days.\n\n(2) The cash equivalent of leave salary payable to a member\nof service, under sub-rule(1) shall also include dearness\nallowance but shall not include any other allowances.\n\n(3) The cash equivalent of leave salary for earned leave payable\nunder sub-rule(1) shall be calculated as follows:\n\nCash payment Pay admissible on the date of retirement/death Number of days\nin lieu of Plus of unutilized\nEarned leave Dearness Allowances admissible thereon earned leave at\ncomponent = x credit up to a\nmaximum of 300\n30 days\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n(4) The leave salary payable for the Half Pay Leave\ncomponent under sub-rule (1), shall be calculated as follows:-\n\nNumber of days\nCash payment Half pay leave salary admissible on the date of of half pay leave\nin lieu of half retirement plus Dearness Allowance admissible at credit subject\nto the total of\npay leave on that date\nx earned leave and\ncomponent = ___________________________________ half pay leave at\ncredit not\n30 exceeding 300\ndays.\n\nProvided that to make up the shortfall in earned leave, no\ncommutation of half pay leave shall be permissible.\n\n(a) A member of the Service who has been permitted by the\nState Government to voluntarily retire from service while\nunder suspension or who is retired by the Central\nGovernment in public interest while under suspension\nshall be paid cash equivalent of leave salary under sub-\nrule(1) in respect of the period of leave at his credit on the\ndate of his retirement from service provided that in the\nopinion of the authority competent to order reinstatement\nthe member of the service has been fully exonerated and\nthe suspension was wholly unjustified.\"\n\n52. Rule 20A of the All India Service (Leave) Rules provides for 300\ndays as the maximum limit for encashment. Both the Supreme\nCourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1958 and the High\nCourtJudges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954 stipulate that\na Judge shall be entitled \"in his entire service, including the period of\nservice rendered in a pensionable post under the Union or State or on re-\nemployment, if any,\" to claim the cash equivalent of leave salary to the\nextent of the maximum period prescribed for encashment of such leave\nunder the All India Service (Leave) Rules, 1955.\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\n\n53. The legislative intent is apparent. The intention of the legislature is\nthat in the entire service of any nature to which the All India Service\n(Leave) Rules, 1955apply, the maximum period prescribed in the said\nrules would apply. The rules restrict the period for which cash equivalent\nof leave salary can be claimed on retirement to 300 days.\n\n54. In view of the above the second question Whether the Lokayukt and\nUp-lokayukt appointed under the M.P. Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt\nAdhiniyam, 1981 are entitled to cash equivalent to unutilized leave, even\nif they have already availed the benefit of leave encashment of 300 days\nin their capacity as Judges prior to their appointment as Lokayukt and\nUp-lokayuktis answered in favour of theState.The Lokayukt and Up-\nLokayukt appointed under the M.P. Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt\nAdhiniyam, 1981 are entitled to cash equivalent to unutilized leave\nsubject to a maximum of 300 days including the number of days of leave\nencashment already availed in their capacity as Judges.\n\n55. Admittedly, both the Petitioners No. 1 in the respective petitions\nwere given cash equivalent to unutilized leave of 300 days in their\ncapacity as Judges. Thus on this count they would not be entitled to any\nfurther amount.\n\n56. In view of the above, the petitions are thus disposed on holding and\ndirecting that:\n\ni. after the 2004 amendment of the M.P. Lokayukt Evam Up-Lokayukt\nAdhiniyam, 1981, Family Pension is payable to the dependent\nfamily member of the Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt from the date of\ndeath of the Lokayukt or Up-Lokayukt, and not from the date a\nWP-7248-2017 & WP-8399-2017\nspecific provision was made in the Madhya Pradesh Lokayukt and\nUp-lokayukt (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1982. The question as\nto what would be the position prior to the 2004 amendment is left\nopen; and\n\nii. Respondents shall make the payment of family pension to Smt.\nMadhu Bhushan (PetitionerNo.2, in W.P.No.8399 of 2017) from\nthe date of death of Shri Justice Chandresh Bhushan i.e. from\n22.08.2018. The arrears shall be paid to Petitioner no. 2 within a\nperiod of 90 days from today along with the interest @ 7% per\nannum; and\n\niii. Respondents, shall issue a revised Pension Payment Order to\nPetitioners of W.P. No. 7248/2017 incorporating the entitlement of\nPetitioner No. 2 to family pension, in compliance of order dated\n05.02.2025, within a period of one month from today, if not\nalready done; and\n\niv. The Lokayukt and Up-Lokayukt appointed under the M.P. Lokayukt\nEvam Up-Lokayukt Adhiniyam, 1981 are entitled to cash\nequivalent to unutilized leave subject to a maximum of 300 days,\nincluding the number of days of leave encashment already availed\nin their capacity as Judges.\n\n57. The petitions are disposed of in the above terms, with no orders as\nto costs.\n\n(SANJEEV SACHDEVA) (VINAY SARAF)\nJUDGE JUDGE\n\nRAVIKAN\n\nDigitally signed by RAVIKANT KEWAT\n\nDN: c=IN, o=HIGH COURT OF MADHYA\nPRADESH, ou=PRINCIPAL BENCH JABALPUR,\n\n2.5.4.20=a8d9b14ac58cf947b7ed23741112684\nb5277de5c828d98b25803bbc1b20fce6e,\n\nT KEWAT\npostalCode=482001, st=Madhya Pradesh,\nserialNumber=B4ADF2781367121A8C6194CA0\nD70E6499C424F691EB777334632E1B1713FB6\n24, cn=RAVIKANT KEWAT\nDate: 2025.05.08 13:50:41 +05'30'",
