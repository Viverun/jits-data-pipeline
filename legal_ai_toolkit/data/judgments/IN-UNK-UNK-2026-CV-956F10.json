JUSTICE HARBANS LAL\n\nPresent:- Mr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate with Mr. Vivek Goel,\n Advocate for the appellants.\n\n Mr. T.S. Salana, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab.\n ****\nJUDGMENT\n\nHARBANS LAL, J.\n\n This appeal is directed against the judgment/ order of sentence\n\ndated 7.3.1998 passed by the Court of learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\nJalandhar whereby he convicted and sentenced the accused Tarsem Lal,\n\nHira, Mohan Lal, Shakuntla and Baldev to undergo rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor 3 years and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- each under \nSection 498-A\n of IPC\n\nand in default of payment thereof, the defaulter was to further undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for 3 months and also sentenced to undergo rigorous\n\nimprisonment for 5 years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/- each under \nSection\n\n306\n of IPC and in default of payment of fine, the defaulter was to further\n\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for one month, with a further direction that\n\nthe substantive sentences shall run concurrently.\n\n Succinctly put, the facts of the prosecution case are that the\n\nmarriage of Kamlesh deceased was solemnised with the accused Tarsem Lal\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -2-\n\nabout 2 years prior to her death, which took place on 11.10.1995. The\n\nharassment and ill-treatment meted out by her husband, her husband's\n\nbrothers and mother-in-law, forced her to douse her body in kerosene oil\n\nand set ablaze on 27.09.1995. Shortly thereafter, she was removed to the\n\nCivil Hospital, Phillaur, where her statement was recorded by Sub Inspector\n\nHarbhajan Singh. On the dint of the same, the FIR was registered. She was\n\nreferred to D.M.C. and Hospital Ludhiana, where she remained hospitalised\n\ntill 11.10.1995 and ultimately she succumbed to the burn injuries. Another\n\ndying declaration of her was recorded by Mr. S.K. Sachdeva, Judicial\n\nMagistrate Ist Class, Ludhiana. In her such dying declaration, she reiterated\n\nthat the accused used to pick up quarrel with her and taunt her of her living\n\nwith her husband's father's younger brother. After death, her dead body was\n\nbrought to Civil Hospital, Phillaur, where the same was subjected to post\n\nmortem examination. In due course, the accused were put under arrest.\n\nAfter completion of investigation, the charge-sheet was laid in the Court of\n\nlearned Illaqa Magistrate, who committed the same to the Court of Sessions\n\nfor trial of the accused.\n\n On commitment, all the accused were charged under \nSections\n\n498-A\n/\n306\n of IPC to which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. To\n\nbring home guilt against the accused, the prosecution examined PW1 Dr.\n\nRam Parshad, PW2 Dr. Jagjit Singh, PW3 Ratto, PW4 ASI Prit Kanwal Jit\n\nSingh, PW5 Prithipal Singh MHC, PW6 Constable Gurmukh Singh, PW7\n\nASI Jagdish Ram, PW8 Iqbal Singh, PW9 Jagdish Lal, Head Clerk, PW10\n\nSI Harbhajan Singh Investigator and closed its evidence.\n\n When examined under \nSection 313\n of Cr.P.C, all the accused\n\ndenied the incriminating circumstances appearing in the prosecution\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -3-\n\nevidence against them and pleaded innocence. Tarsem Lal accused has put\n\nforth as under:-\n\n \"I am innocent. After about one month of my marriage, I went\n\n back to Saudi Arabia where from I had come for the purpose of\n\n marriage as I had been there for the livelihood since 1988. I\n\n came back at Delhi on 24.9.1995 and reached my village on\n\n that night. My luggage while coming to India had been booked\n\n in separate Cargo which was not given to me and on 27.9.95\n\n early in the morning I and my younger brother Mohan Lal had\n\n gone to Delhi to take the luggage but it was not traceable and\n\n we both came back to our village on the evening of 28.9.95 and\n\n came to know about this episode. Then, we both the brothers\n\n went to D.M.C. Ludhiana, where my wife Kamlesh had been\n\n under treatment due to burn injuries. I and my father had spent\n\n about 20,000/- Rupees on the medicines, which the doctors\n\n prescribed for her. The receipts regarding the purchase of\n\n medicines are with me. I had great love and affection with my\n\n wife and from my earnings, I had provided her with all the\n\n facilities like colour TV, Fridge, VCR, deck, clothes and\n\n ornaments etc. In the month of June 1995, I was informed that\n\n my wife had appendicitis and I had informed my parents to get\n\n her admitted in the hospital for treatment and consequently, she\n\n was admitted in Jyoti Nursing home on 15.6.1994 and about\n\n Rs.10,000/- had been spent for her treatment. The doctor of the\n\n said nursing home namely Gurbir Kaur Bath after thoroughly\n\n examining my wife, had also informed that there was a tumor in\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -4-\n\n Bachedani and she used to remain dismayed on account of this\n\n and had been telling to my mother that would she be able to\n\n bear a child. I and my mother had been consoling her that her\n\n proper treatment would be got arranged and she would be all\n\n right and almighty would prove all type of pleasure to us. I\n\n never rebuked her nor I ill-treated her nor harassed her on any\n\n count. I am also astonishing as to why she had committed\n\n suicide. She had after my departure to Saudi Arabia shifted in\n\n the house of my real uncle Chaman Lal who is doing karyana\n\n shop in the village. But on the request of my mother-in-law, to\n\n my father, Kamlesh came to the house of my parents only 3\n\n months prior to my arrival in India. My uncle Chaman Lal had\n\n kept some of her ornaments which were not given back to her\n\n and she was also very much disturbed on the non-delivery of\n\n the ornaments by my uncle. The panchayat sarpanches and\n\n other respectables of village Garha i.e., my in-laws village and\n\n of my village Rasulpur, made request to the investigating\n\n agency that I and my other family members were innocent and\n\n they should not be challaned but even then we have been\n\n challaned by the police. I am innocent.\"\n\n Accused Bhira has set forth in the following terms:-\n\n \"I am innocent. On the day of occurrence, i.e. 27.9.95, I and\n\n my mother Shakuntla along with other villagers had gone to\n\n pay homage to the shrine of Chint Purni and Jwala Ji and came\n\n back on 28.9.95 evening and heard about this incident. I used\n\n to do labour and go for labour purposes from the house early in\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -5-\n\n the morning and come back late at night. I had full regard for\n\n my sister-in-law Kamlesh deceased and never had any quarrel\n\n with her. I am innocent and have been falsely implicated in\n\n this case.\"\n\n Accused Mohan Lal has stated as under:-\n\n \"I am innocent. On 27.9.95, early in the morning I and my\n\n brother Tarsem Lal had gone to Delhi Airport to take luggage,\n\n which my brother had brought from abroad but that was not\n\n traceable and stayed in the night at Delhi. In the next evening\n\n of 28.9.95, I and Tarsem Lal came back to the village and\n\n heard about the sad episode. We both rushed to DMC\n\n Ludhiana, where my sister-in-law Kamlesh was admitted for\n\n her treatment I always treated her as my mother being elder\n\n sister-in-law and never picked up any quarrel with her. I have\n\n been falsely implicated in this case.\"\n\n Accused Shakuntla has taken up the following plea:-\n\n \"I am innocent. After the marriage of my son with Kamlesh,\n\n my son went to Saudi Arabia after one month of the marriage.\n\n I treated Kamlesh just as my daughter and not as daughter-in-\n\n law. There had been no conflict between us. She had\n\n developed appendicitis and her treatment was obtained in Jyoti\n\n Nursing Home, Phillaur, and about Rs.10,000/- had been spent.\n\n She remained admitted in the hospital for 10 days and I had\n\n been nursing her like mother. On the instigation of her mother\n\n Ratto, she had gone to the house of my brother-in-law Chaman\n\n Lal in the same village after about 1½ months of the marriage,\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -6-\n\n and when letter from my son Tarsem Lal was received that he\n\n was coming back to India, her mother Ratto and Kamlesh came\n\n to our house and begged pardon for their folly for leaving the\n\n house and my husband Mohinder Pal forgave them and\n\n allowed to live in our house. I and my son Bhira and other co-\n\n villagers for about 40 in number had gone to pay homage to\n\n Chint Purni and Jwalaji on the day of occurrence on the truck\n\n of Hansa our co-villager and had come back to the village on\n\n 28.7.1995 and heard about the sad episode. Kamlesh used to\n\n remain dismayed as the doctor had told her that there was\n\n tumor on her ovary and she was apprehending, if she would be\n\n able to bear a child or not. We never gave any type of\n\n maltreatment nor made any demand of dowry from her and I\n\n have been falsely implicated in this case.\n\n Accused Baldev has stated as under:-\n\n \"I am innocent and do agriculture labour in the fields of a\n\n landlord known as Tehsildar in village Rurka. I occasionally\n\n come to my home once in a week and on the day of occurrence,\n\n I was not present at the house. I had been informed by one\n\n Darshan Singh of my village about the said incident. I had full\n\n respect for my sister-in-law Kamlesh deceased. I had no\n\n quarrel with her on any occasion. I have been falsely\n\n implicated in this case.\"\n\n In their defence, they examined DW1 Gurdas Singh, DW2\n\nPiare Lal and DW3 Mohinder Lal.\n\n After hearing the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -7-\n\nState, the learned defence counsel and examining the evidence on record,\n\nthe learned trial Court convicted and sentenced all the accused as noticed at\n\nthe outset. Feeling aggrieved with their conviction/ sentence, they have\n\npreferred this appeal.\n\n I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n\nrecord with due care and circumspection.\n\n Mr. H.S. Gill, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of\n\nthe appellants urged with great vigour that the First Information Report in\n\nthe instant case was recorded on the statement of Kamlesh deceased, when\n\nshe had been removed to the Civil Hospital at Phillaur, after she had\n\nreceived burn injuries. In this statement, she had alleged that the accused\n\npersons used to quarrel with her and she had poured kerosene oil on her and\n\nset herself afire and was removed to the Civil Hospital, Phillaur by her\n\nfather-in-law, from where she was referred to Daya Nand Medical College\n\nand Hospital, Ludhiana, where her statement was recorded by a Magistrate\n\nin which she stated that all her in-laws family members used to say that she\n\nwas bad with her father-in-law's brother and that she will die and then she\n\nset herself on fire. From this dying declaration, no inference of abetment of\n\nsuicide can be drawn, nor any offence under \nSection 498-A\n of IPC can be\n\nsaid to have been committed. In fact, the only witness produced regarding\n\nthe alleged harassment was her mother Ratto PW3 and even she did not give\n\nany reason or motive for the alleged treatment. A perusal of her statement\n\nclearly indicates that a false story was created after unfortunate death of her\n\ndaughter Kamlesh. Indeed, Ratto PW has also admitted that Tarsem Lal\n\nappellant had gone to Saudi Arabia only one or one and a half months after\n\nthe marriage and returned only on 24.9.1995. Actually, on 25.9.1995,\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -8-\n\nTarsem Lal had again gone to Delhi to collect his luggage, which had been\n\nbooked by a separate Cargo. He came back on 28.9.1995 to his village and\n\nbefore that the incident had occurred. The learned trial Court has failed to\n\nappreciate the conduct of the accused persons that it was Mohinder Lal,\n\nfather-in-law of the deceased who had removed her to Civil Hospital,\n\nPhillaur and then to DMC and Hospital, Ludhiana, where she expired on\n\n11.10.1995, i.e., after 14 days of the alleged occurrence. During this\n\ninterregnum, more than Rs.20,000/- were spent by the husband of the\n\ndeceased on her treatment. Ratto PW has also admitted that her son-in-law\n\nTarsem Lal after the marriage had provided amenities like Television,\n\nFridge, gold ornaments etc. to the deceased. There was no complaint made\n\nby Ratto either to the police or to any Panchayat of the Village, which also\n\nshows that a false story was coined with an ulterior motive.\n\n As emanates from the defence evidence, on the date of\n\noccurrence, only Mohinder Lal, father-in-law of the deceased was in the\n\nhouse and he had extinguished the fire. He himself had also received\n\ninjuries and got her admitted in Civil Hospital, Phillaur. Neither accused\n\nwas present in the house at the time of occurrence. In fact, the deceased\n\nused to remain depressed, because when about an year earlier, she was\n\noperated upon for appendicitis, a tumor was also removed from her Uterus.\n\nShe had a feeling that she will not be able to bear a child. She was ashamed\n\nof her own follies. In these premises, the charged offence is not established\n\nagainst either appellant.\n\n \nTo buttress these stances, he has sought to place abundant\n\nreliance upon \nHans Raj v. State of Haryana\n, 2004(2) Apex Criminal 476;\n\nMahendra Singh and another v. State of M.P.\n, 1996 Criminal Law\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -9-\n\nJournal 894 and State of Haryana v. Ravi Kumar, 2005(2) Recent\n\nCriminal Reports (Criminal) 237.\n\n To overcome these submissions, Mr. T.S. Salana, Deputy\n\nAdvocate General, Punjab appearing on behalf of the State argued that the\n\ndying declaration Ex.PX coupled with the subsequent dying declaration\n\nEx.PB speaks volumes of the fact that the conduct of the appellants had\n\nbrought about the situation to such a boil, which forced her to commit\n\nsuicide.\n\n On a careful consideration of the rival contentions, the view I\n\nam disposed to take is that the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants\n\noutweigh the submissions made by Mr. Salana for the reasons to be\n\nrecorded hereinafter:-\n\n The sheet-anchor of the prosecution is the dying declaration\n\nEx.PB recorded by Harbahajan Singh Sub Inspector, investigator followed\n\nby another dying declaration Ex.PX taken down by Mr. S.K. Sachdeva,\n\nJudicial Magistrate First Class, Ludhiana. The sum and substance of the Ex.\n\nPB is that \"my (referring to the deceased) husband Tarsem Lal son of\n\nMohinder Lal and my mother-in-law Shakuntla and my Deor Deba, Bhabbar\n\nand Mohan used to pick up quarrels with me and my husband Tarsem Lal\n\nson of Mohinder Lal was saying that I will be finished off. Thereafter, by\n\ngoing into the kitchen, I poured kerosene oil and set myself ablaze. The fire\n\nwas put off by my father-in-law Mohinder Lal.\" It is in the evidence of Dr.\n\nRam Parshad PW1 that \"Hair of the body singed and burns were 100%\" It\n\nis also in his cross-examination that \"the injured had 100% burn injuries,\n\nwhen she was brought to Civil Hospital, Phillaur. It is correct that on\n\nEx.PB, I did not give any starting certificate nor at the end of statement of\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -10-\n\nSmt. Kamlesh that she remained fit throughout, when her statement was got\n\nrecorded by the Sub Inspector in my presence.\" The question arises if she\n\nhad 100% burn injuries on her body, could she be able to make a\n\ncomprehensive statement Ex. PB. It is crystal clear from the above\n\nextracted cross-examination of this Doctor that neither at the start nor on\n\nconclusion of dying declaration, he certified that she was in a fit state of\n\nmind to make statement and remained fit throughout, when her statement\n\nwas being recorded. Ex. PB is not in question/answer form. The degree of\n\nburns ipso-facto gives rise to the presumption that in such a critical\n\ncondition, she could not give such a statement. The absence of certification\n\nby the Doctor regarding fitness of the patient on both the stages, further\n\nraises dimensions of suspicion. Thus, the authenticity of Ex. PB is rendered\n\nhighly doubtful. The investigator has not assigned any reason worth\n\nmention as to why he did not approach the Illaqa Magistrate at Phillaur\n\nwhere undeniably Judicial Courts are situated. It is not in his evidence that\n\nthe condition of the patient was deteriorating and feeling that she may die\n\nbefore he approached the Illaqa Magistrate, he proceeded to record her\n\nstatement. She survived for about 14 days. He went on to say that on\n\nconclusion of the dying declaration, it was attested by the Doctor, whereas\n\nPW1 Dr. Ram Parshad has denied this fact. \nA close examination of Ex.PB\n\nwould reveal that it does not bear the opinion of the Doctor that she was in a\n\nfit state of mind to make statement and continued to be so, while she was\n\nunder examination. The statements made by a person as to the cause of his\n\ndeath or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction, which resulted in\n\nhis death are themselves relevant facts and admissible in evidence under\n\nSection 32(1)\n of the Indian Evidence Act in case in which the cause of that\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -11-\n\nperson's death comes into question. A statement commonly known as\n\n\"dying declaration\" constitutes such an important evidence in criminal\n\ncases. It is thus necessary that a Court trying the case should have before it\n\na correct and faithful record of the statement made by the dead person, as\n\nruled in re: \nKhushal Rao v. State of Bombay\n, AIR 1958 Supreme Court\n\n22 followed in \nHarbans Singh and another v. The State of Punjab\n, AIR\n\n1962 Supreme Court 439. Chapter 13-A of the Rules and Orders of Punjab\n\nand Haryana High Court, Volume 3 contemplates that where a person whose\n\nevidence is essential to the prosecution of a criminal charge or to the proper\n\ninvestigation of an alleged crime, is in danger of dying before the enquiry\n\nproceedings or the trial of the case commences, his statement, if possible, be\n\ngot recorded by a Judicial Magistrate. When the police officer concerned\n\nwith the investigation of the case or the medical officer attending upon such\n\nperson apprehends that such person is in the danger of dying before the case\n\nis put in court, he may apply to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and, in his\n\nabsence, to the senior most Judicial Magistrate present at the headquarters,\n\nfor recording the dying declaration. On receiving such application, the\n\nsenior most Judicial Magistrate shall at once either himself proceed, or\n\ndepute some other Judicial Magistrate to record the dying declaration.\n\nBefore proceeding to record the dying declaration, the Judicial Magistrate\n\nshall satisfy himself that the declarant is in a fit condition to make a\n\nstatement, and if the medical officer is present, or his attendance can be\n\nsecured without loss of time, his certificate as to the fitness of the declarant\n\nto make a statement should be obtained. If, however, the circumstances do\n\nnot permit waiting for the attendance of the Medical Officer, the Judicial\n\nMagistrate may in such cases proceed forthwith to record the dying\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -12-\n\ndeclaration, but he should note down why he considered it impracticable or\n\ninadvisable to wait for a doctor's attendance. The statement, whether made\n\non oath or otherwise, shall be taken down by the Judicial Magistrate in the\n\nform of a simple narrative. This, however, will not prevent the Judicial\n\nMagistrate from clearing up any ambiguity, or asking the declarant to\n\ndisclose the cause of his apprehended death or the circumstances of the\n\ntransaction in which he sustained the injuries. If any occasion arises for\n\nputting question to the dying man, the Judicial Magistrate should record the\n\nquestions as also the answers which he receives. The actual words of the\n\ndeclarant should be taken down and not merely their substance. As far as\n\npossible, the statement should be recorded in the language of the declarant\n\nor the court language. At the conclusion of the statement, the Judicial\n\nMagistrate shall read out the same to the declarant and obtain his signature\n\nor thumb impression in token of its correctness, unless it is not possible to\n\ndo so. The dying declaration shall then be placed in a sealed cover and\n\ntransmitted to the Judicial Magistrate having jurisdiction to deal with the\n\ncase to which it relates. Where in an emergency a dying declaration has to\n\nbe recorded at a place away from the District Headquarters, the\n\ninvestigating officer or the medical officer attending upon the dying man\n\nshall apply to the nearest Judicial Magistrate to record the dying declaration\n\nand such Judicial Magistrate shall immediately proceed to the spot and take\n\ndown the statement of the dying man. This, however, would not prevent the\n\nmedical officer or the police officer connected with the investigation of the\n\ncase from recording the dying declaration, if he is of the opinion that death\n\nis imminent and there is no time to call a Judicial Magistrate. In such cases,\n\nthe police or the medical officer concerned must note down why it was not\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -13-\n\nconsidered expedient to apply to a Judicial Magistrate for recording the\n\ndying declaration or to wait for his arrival. Where a dying declaration is\n\nrecorded by a police officer or a medical officer, it shall, so far as possible,\n\nbe got attested by one or more out of the persons who happen to be present\n\nat the time.\n\n \nA careful delving into Ex.PB would reveal that the Investigator\n\nhas not noted down as to why it was not considered expedient to apply to\n\nthe Judicial Magistrate at Phillaur for recording the dying declaration. It too\n\ndoes not bear the attestation of one or more out of the persons who\n\nhappened to be present at the material time. It is duty of the person\n\nrecording a dying declaration to take every possible precaution to ensure the\n\nmaking of a free and spontaneous statement by the declarant without any\n\nprompting suggestion or aid from any other person. As ruled by the Apex\n\nCourt in re: State of Punjab through \nSecretary v. Raj Kumar and others\n,\n\n2008(8) Supreme Court Cases 543, the Court has to scrutinise the dying\n\ndeclaration carefully and must ensure that the declaration is not the result of\n\ntutoring, prompting or imagination. The deceased had opportunity to\n\nobserve and identify the assailant and was in a fit state to make the\n\ndeclaration. Where the dying declaration is suspicious, it should not be\n\nacted upon without corroborative evidence. The dying declaration which\n\nsuffers from infirmity cannot form the basis of conviction. Normally, the\n\nCourt in order to satisfy whether the deceased was in a fit mental condition\n\nto make the dying declaration look upto the medical opinion. But where the\n\neye witness has said that the deceased was in a fit and conscious state to\n\nmake this dying declaration, the medical opinion cannot prevail. Where the\n\nprosecution version differs from the version as given in the dying\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -14-\n\ndeclaration, the said declaration cannot be acted upon. Where there is more\n\nthan one statement, the nature of dying declaration, one first in point of time\n\nmust be preferred. Of course, if the plurality of dying declarations could be\n\nheld to be trustworthy and reliable, it has to be accepted.\n\n \nAs observed in re: \nHans Raj\n (supra), the woman committed\n\nsuicide within seven years of marriage due to the cruelty by the husband.\n\nThe allegations against the accused were that he was addicted to\n\nconsumption of \"Bhang\" and there were frequent quarrels between the two.\n\nSometimes, she was given beatings. The Apex Court held that this fact\n\nalone does not automatically give rise to the presumption that the suicide\n\nhad been abetted by her husband. The Court should find out that cruelty\n\nwas of such a nature as was likely to derive the woman to commit suicide or\n\nto cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health of the woman. In the\n\npresent one, there are no allegations in either dying declaration that either\n\naccused used to give beatings to the deceased.\n \nIf it is assumed that there\n\nused to be quarrels between the deceased and the accused-appellants on\n\naccount of her putting up in the house of Chaman Lal, nonetheless, in view\n\nof \nHans Raj\n case (supra), the offence under \nSection 306\n of IPC is not\n\nestablished.\n In re Ravi Kumar(supra), the woman committed suicide by\n\nsetting herself on fire. As per dying declaration, her husband was not of\n\ngood character and both used to quarrel with each other. The detail of\n\ncharacter was not spelt out. On a night preceding suicide, husband gave\n\nbeatings to her. It was held that offence of abetment under \nSection 306\n of\n\nIPC is not made out. Every domestic quarrel between a couple cannot be\n\ntaken as a ground for abetment to suicide and the behaviour of a normal and\n\nnot a quarrelsome or high strung individual must be taken as the yard stick.\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -15-\n\nIn the instant case, the record is quite barren to show as to what had\n\nhappened between the deceased and the accused- appellants soon before,\n\nshe committed suicide. Thus, it is very difficult to say in the factual\n\nscenario that the deceased had put an end to her life on being abetted by the\n\naccused - appellants.\n\n On Ex. PB there are two over-lapping thumb impressions. Of\n\nthese, one being wholly ink smudged is wholly in-decipherable, whereas the\n\nother one, which seems to have been super-imposed partly reveal a few\n\nridge characteristics. For the reasons detailed heretofore, this document is\n\nof suspicious nature. Consequently, it has to be excluded from\n\nconsideration.\n\n Adverting to Ex.PX, it too reveals that the opinion of the\n\nDoctor before start or at the conclusion was not obtained. This also does\n\nnot bear the certification by the learned Magistrate that the declarant was fit\n\nto make a statement and it contained a correct and faithful record of the\n\nstatement made by her as well as of the questions which were put to her. As\n\nits contents proceed, all the members of the family, my mother-in-law,\n\nhusband, 3 devars, Deba, Mohan and Boga used to quarrel by saying that I\n\nwas residing with the brother of my father-in-law. There is nothing else in\n\nEx.PX. It is in the cross-examination of Ratto PW, mother of the deceased,\n\nthat \"when Tarsem Lal, husband of the deceased went to Saudi Arabia, she\n\n(deceased) started residing with Chaman Lal (brother of her father-in-law).\n\n\"It is correct that my daughter came back to her in-laws house three months\n\nprior to 24.9.1995 on receipt of letter from her husband Tarsem Lal about\n\nhis proposed visit to his house. I then told Mohinder Lal, father-in-law to\n\nforgive my daughter of her mistake. I did not file any complaint either\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -16-\n\nbefore the Panchayat of Rasulpur or Garha against the maltreatment of my\n\ndaughter by the accused. It is correct that Chaman Lal's wife had taken the\n\ngold necklace of my daughter. I do not know if anybody was present in the\n\nhouse of her in-laws when my daughter was done to death.\" It is correct\n\nthat we had not brought the dead body of Kamlesh as we were not in good\n\nfinancial position. I do not know that my daughter was cremated in her in-\n\nlaws' house and her ashes were immersed at Kiratpur. I do not know, if both\n\nthe Panchayats supported about the innocence of the accused in this episode\n\nbefore the police. It is correct that my son-in-law demanded the golden\n\nnecklace from Kamlesh lying with Chaman Lal and I also asked Chaman\n\nLal for return of gold necklace to which he stated that he had no objection to\n\nreturn the same, if the accused return this amount.\" Ostensibly, this\n\nevidence fits in with the plea taken by Tarsem Lal appellant. Ex.PX is silent\n\nabout the fact that the accused- appellants used to suspect that she had illicit\n\nrelations with Chaman Lal and on that account, they used to pick up\n\nquarrels with her. Ratto PW has not specifically denied that the Panchayats\n\nhad supported about the innocence of the accused in this episode before the\n\npolice. Had the Panchayats not supported the version of the accused-\n\nappellants, she would have been the last person to give answer to such a\n\nmaterial question in an evasive and unambiguous manner. Ratto has not\n\ncategorically denied the absence of either appellant in the house of in-laws\n\nof the deceased, when the occurrence took place. It is in the cross-\n\nexamination of PW10 SI Harbahajan Singh that \"I did not record statement\n\nof any neighbour of the house of the accused regarding the occurrence nor\n\nof any person of Village Garha, where the deceased belonged.\" He has not\n\napportioned any reason for not examining any neighbour of the accused.\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -17-\n\nRatto has also not assigned any reason for not reporting to the Panchayat of\n\nRasulpur or Garha against the alleged maltreatment being meted out to the\n\ndeceased. If the accused- appellants had been subjecting the deceased to\n\nmaltreatment or harassment, the deceased or her mother or both would have\n\ncertainly complained in this behalf to the police or the Panchayat of the\n\naforesaid villages. It is in the cross-examination of SI Harbahajan Singh\n\n(sic.) that \"Smt. Ratto, mother of the deceased did not give any letter or\n\ndocument regarding ill-treatment of the deceased by the accused. I did not\n\nrecord statement of Chaman Lal at whose house, the deceased lived. When\n\nSmt. Kamlesh committed suicide, none of the accused was at home.\" This\n\nwitness has not given any reason for not examining Chaman Lal, which\n\naccording to the alleged prosecution version was a bone of contention.\n\nFurthermore, as per his testimony, none of the accused-appellant was\n\npresent in the house, when the occurrence took place. If the accused party\n\nhad been bent upon to take the life of the deceased, in that, eventuality, her\n\nfather-in-law Mohinder Lal DW3, would have not tried to saver her by\n\nhimself engulfing in the flames. There is no gain saying the fact that when\n\nhe made an endeavour to douse the fire by putting water from the nearby tap\n\non her, he also sustained injuries and he also removed her primarily to Civil\n\nHospital, Phillaur and then to DMC & Hospital, Ludhiana. As per Ex. PX,\n\nthe accused used to quarrel with the deceased, by saying that she was living\n\nin the house of her husband's father-in-law's brother. She has nowhere stated\n\nthat the accused used to maltreat or put her to harassment on the suspicion\n\nthat she had illicit relations with Chaman Lal or that she was ever beaten up.\n\nWhatsoever has been stated by Ratto (sic) does not find place in Ex. PX.\n\nThus, her ocular evidence cannot be believed. If the deceased had\n\n Criminal Appeal No.353-SB of 1998 -18-\n\ncommitted suicide being fed up with the behaviour of the accused, in all\n\nhuman probabilities, the dead body would have not been given to them for\n\ncremation. The same would have certainly been cremated by her mother\n\nalongwith other relatives by taking the same to their own village. There\n\nappears to be a substance in the submission of Mr. Gill that the deceased\n\nbeing ashamed of her own follies committed suicide. The other reason may\n\nbe the non-return of neclace by the wife of Chaman Lal or she being unable\n\nto bear the child would have undergone acute mental depression. The\n\nevidence let in by the prosecution too falls short of establishing the offence\n\nunder \nSection 498-A\n of IPC.\n\n In view of the above discussion, neither any dying declaration\n\nnor evidence tendered by Ratto PW can be made the basis for conviction, on\n\nany count. Consequently, this appeal is accepted, setting aside the impugned\n\njudgment. The accused- appellants are acquitted of the charged offence.\n\nMarch 04, 2009 ( HARBANS LAL )\nrenu JUDGE\n\n Too often, it is noticed that the Judicial Magistrates, while\n\nrecording Dying Declarations, do not follow the guidelines referred to in\n\nthis Judgment.
