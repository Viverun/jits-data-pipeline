Sh. Bachittar Singh\nvide order dated 22.10.2019, which reads\n\nas under:-\n\n\"During the course of arguments, it\n\ntranspired that there is apparent conflict between two\n\nDivision Benches' judgments of this Court regarding\ninterpretation of Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules,\n\n1972.\n\n2. One of the Division Bench of this Court\n(Coram: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Kurian Joseph, Chief\nJustice and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dharam Chand\nChaudary, Judge) in State of Himachal Pradesh\nthrough Principal Secretary (Health) Vs. Joginder\nSingh, 2012 (3) Him L.R. (DB) 1288 has held as under:-\n\n\"xx xx xx Rule 49(3) of the CCS (Pension)\nRules reads as follows:-\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\n\"In calculating the length of qualifying\nservice,fraction of a year equal to three months and\nabove shall be treated as a completed one half year and\nreckoned as qualifying service.\"\n\n.\n\n2. In terms of the above rule a person having\n\nthree months service shall be treated to have completed\none half of service for being counted as qualifying\nservice. Logically, a person having service of six months\n\nand above, should be treated to have completed two half\nyears for the purpose of qualifying service. In other\nwords, in the case of a person having service of nine\nyears and six months, the qualifying service shall be\ntaken as ten years and thus he shall be entitled to\n\nminimum pension. State has come up in appeal against\nthe judgment, dated 9th March, 2010 whereby the\nlearned Single Judge has granted relief to the petitioner\nto the effect that he should be deemed to be in service\n\nupto 30th June, 2008, in terms of the letter dated\n\n25.09.2007. That letter pertains to the grant of extension\nof 10 months of service to complete 10 years of service.\nSubsequently, the same has been withdrawn. Thus\naggrieved, the petitioner filed the writ petition. xx xx\"\n\n3. Notably, in the aforesaid case, the petitioner\neven though had put in service of nine years, nine\n\nmonths and five days, yet the Court had specifically held\nthat a person having service of nine years and six\n\nmonths, the qualifying service shall be taken as ten\nyears and thus he shall be held entitled to minimum\n\npension.(see underlined portion above).\n\n4. It was on the basis of the aforesaid\njudgment that learned Single Judge of this Court, vide\nimpugned order held that the case of the petitioner\nherein to be covered under the said judgment since he\nhad already rendered nine years, eight months and three\ndays service.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\n5. However, when an identical question again\ncame up for consideration before another Division Bench\nof this Court (Coram: Hon'ble Mr. Justice A.M.\n\n.\n\nKhanwilkar, Chief Justice and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv\n\nSharma, Judge) in CWP No. 7708 of 2012, titled as\n\nPrem Sagar Vs. State of H.P. and others\ndecided on\n\n11.6.2013, the Bench categorically held that the benefit\nunder Rule 49(3) could be extended to an employee only\nif he has put in nine years and nine months of qualifying\n\nservice, as is evident from para 3 to 5 of the judgment,\nwhich reads as under :-\n\n\"3. It is not in dispute that the petitioner has put\n\nin only nine years and seven months of service. The\nquestion is whether Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension)\n\nRules would oblige the respondents to reckon the period\nof service of the petitioner as complete year for\ndetermining the qualifying service. Rule 49 (3) reads\nthus:\n\n\"49. Amount of Pension\n(1) xxx xxx xxx\n(2) xxx xxx xxx\n\n(3) In calculating the length of qualifying service,\nfraction of a year equal to three months and above\n\nshall be treated as a completed one half-year and\nreckoned as qualifying service.\"\n\n4. It would be apposite to also advert to the\ninstructions issued by the Government of India in furtherance\nof Rule 49 (3),which read thus:\n\n\"(2) Three months and above but less than six\nmonths treated as one-half year. -The intention of\nsub-rule (3) of Rule 49 is that, the period of three\nmonths and above but less than six months would be\ntreated as a completed one-half year and reckoned\nas qualifying service for determining of pension. The\nperiod of nine months would, therefore, be two half\nyears.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\n[D.O. No. 28 (15)/83PU, dated the 13th October,\n1983, from Shri K.S. Mahadevan, Under Secretary to\nthe Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs,\naddressed to Shri P. Muthuswamy.]\n\n.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\"\n\n5. On conjoint reading of the Rule and the\ninstructions, we have no manner of doubt that unless\n\nthe employee has put in at least \"nine years and nine\nmonths\" of service, it would not be permissible to\ntreat the person having completed the qualifying\nservice of ten years. The rounding off may not be\npossible even if there was to be shortfall of one day.\n\nThe two half years can be reckoned only if the period\nis nine months or more.\n\n6. In view of the apparent conflict between the two\njudgments\nr referred to hereinabove regarding the\n\ninterpretation of Rule 49(3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules,\n1972, the matter is required to be decided by a Larger Bench\nof this Court. Accordingly, the Registry is directed to place\n\nthe papers before Hon'ble the Chief Justice for appropriate\norders.\"\n\n2. The Division Bench of this Court has thus made a reference\n\nwith regard to the interpretation of Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension)\n\nRules,1972, in view of the two conflicting judgments on the same by the\n\nDivision Benches of this Court in State of H.P. Versus Joginder Singh,\n\n[2012] (3) Him. L.R. 1288 and CWP No.7708 of 2012, titled Prem Sagar\n\nVersus State of H.P. & others, decided on 11.06.2013.\n\n3. We have heard Ms. Ritta Goswami, learned Additional\n\nAdvocate General for the appellants and Shri Sanjeev Bhushan, learned\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nSenior Counsel, assisted by Shri Rakesh Chauhan, learned counsel, for the\n\nrespondents.\n\n4. Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules reads as under:-\n\n.\n\n\"(3) In calculating the length of qualifying\nservice, fraction of a year equal to three months and\n\nabove shall be treated as a completed one half-year\nand reckoned as qualifying service.\"\n\n5. Similarly, the Government of India's decision in terms of D.O.\n\nNo. 28 (15)/83-PU, dated the 13th October, 1983, from Shri K.S.\n\nMahadevan, Under Secretary to the Government of India, Ministry of Home\n\nAffairs, addressed to Shri P. Muthuswamy reads as under:-\n\n\"(2) Three months and above but less than six\nmonths treated as one-half year.- The intention of\n\nsub-rule (3) of Rule 49 is that, the period of three\nmonths and above but less than six months would be\ntreated as completed one-half year and reckoned as\n\nqualifying service for determining of pension. The\n\nperiod of nine months would, therefore, be two half\nyears.\"\n\n6. While interpreting the above provisions, the Division Bench in\n\nState of H.P. Versus Joginder Singh\n(supra) held that in the case of a person\n\nhaving service of nine years and six months, the qualifying service shall be\n\ntaken as ten years and thus, he shall be entitled to minimum pension as, in\n\nterms of Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, if a person having three\n\nmonths service, shall be treated to have completed one-half of service for\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nbeing counted as qualifying service, logically a person having service of six\n\nmonths and above should be treated to have completed two-half years for\n\nthe purpose of qualifying service.\n\n.\n\n7. In the said case, the facts were to the effect that the\n\npetitioner/employee was having nine years nine months and five days of\n\nqualifying service, yet as he was not having the qualifying service of ten\n\nyears, he was denied pension by the Department which decision of the\n\nDepartment was held to be bad by the learned Single Judge in the writ\n\npetition filed by Joginder Singh.\n\n8. Feeling aggrieved, the Department had filed a Letters Patent\n\nAppeal, which was finally disposed of by the Division Bench in the following\n\nterms:-\n\n\"4. During the pendency of the appeal, it\nwas noted on facts that the writ petitioner had\n\notherwise service of 9 years, 9 months and 5 days\nand, therefore, this Court issued a direction as to\n\nwhether in terms of Rule 49 sub rule (3) of CCS\n(Pension) Rules, 1972, the same could be taken as\n\n10 years. Now, the administrative department after\nconsultation with the Finance Department has filed\naffidavit, dated 6th June, 2012, wherein it has been\nclarified that the period of 9 years and 9 months and\nabove should be treated as 10 years in terms of sub\nrule (3) of Rule 49 of CCS (Pension), Rules, 1972,\nas qualifying service of 10 years for the pension. In\nthat view of the matter, it has become unnecessary\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nto go into the merits of the writ petition. Therefore,\nthe judgment under appeal is set aside, with a\ndirection to the appellants to work out th relief in\n\n.\n\nterms of Annexure-C, dated 2nd June, 2012 and\n\ngrant eligible benefits within a period of two months\nfrom the date of production of the copy of this\n\njudgment by the petitioner before the Director of\nHealth Services, failing which the petitioner will be\nentitled to interest @ 12% per annum from the date\n\nof filing of the writ petition and the officer(s)\nresponsible for the delay shall be personally liable\nfor the same. In the event of interest thus being paid,\n\nthe matter shall be report to the Accountant General\n\nfor further action.\"\n\n9. In Prem Sagar Versus State of H.P. & others, CWP No.7708\n\nof 2012-A, decided on 11.06.2013, the petitioner therein had nine years and\n\nseven months of service and the question was whether Rule 49 (3) of the\n\nCCS (Pension) Rules would oblige the respondents to reckon the said\n\nperiod of service of the petitioner as complete years for determining the\n\nqualifying service.\n\n10. The Division Bench after taking into consideration the\n\nprovisions of Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules as well as the\n\ninstructions issued by the Government of India in furtherance of Rule 49(3)\n\nheld that the petitioner having completed only nine years and seven months\n\nof service would not qualify for the benefit of Rule 49 (3) so as to be treated\n\nhaving qualifying service for the reason that the plain language of Rule 49\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\n(3) read with the instructions issued by the Government of India did not\n\npermit such construction.\n\n11. For completion of record, it is necessary to mention that CWP\n\n.\n\nNo. 7708 of 2012-A, titled as\nPrem Sagar Vs. The State of H.P. and others\n\nwas earlier allowed vide judgment dated 3 rd January, 2013 by the Division\n\nBench by relying upon the judgment in LPA No. 285 of 2010, titled as\nState\n\nof H.P. and another Vs. Joginder Singh\n, decided on 22.06.2012.\n\nHowever, a\n\nreview petition, i.e., Review Petition No. 4004 of 2013, titled as\nState of H.P.\n\n& others Vs. Prem Sagar\npreferred against\nthe said judgment\nby the State\n\nwas allowed by the Division Bench on 11th June, 2013 and the writ petition\n\nwas ordered to be restored to the file. Pursuant thereto, the matter was\n\nheard afresh and the writ petition was dismissed in terms of judgment dated\n\n11.06.2013, already referred to hereinabove.\n\nFor the purpose of record, it is\n\nalso pertinent to mention that before the abovementioned review petition\n\nwas allowed, another Division Bench of this Court in CWP No. 8786 of\n\n2012-I, titled as\nLashkari Ram Vs. State of H.P. and others\n, decided on 8th\n\nMay, 2013, while following the earlier judgment passed by the Division\n\nBench in\nPrem Sagar Vs. State of H.P. and others\n, decided on 3rd January,\n\n2013, held that an incumbent, who had put in 9 years and 8 months service,\n\nwould be deemed to have rendered 10 years service, which qualifies him for\n\npension.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\n12. Before proceeding further, it is necessary at this stage to refer\n\nto Rule 49 (1) of the CCS (Pension) Rules also. This sub-rule deals with the\n\namount of pension and the same reads as under:-\n\n.\n\n\"(1) Final amount of service gratuity to be\nrounded off to the next higher rupee- With a view\n\nto simplifying the procedure for payment of service\ngratuity as admissible under Rule 49(1) of the CCS\n(Pension) Rules, 1972, it has been decided that the\n\namount of service gratuity as finally calculated\nshould be rounded off to the next higher rupee.\"\n\n13. A plain reading of the said Rule demonstrates that sub-rule (1)\n\nthereof stipulates that in the case of a Government servant retiring in\n\naccordance with the provisions of CCS (Pension) Rules, before completing\n\nqualifying service of ten years, the amount of gratuity payable to such\n\nGovernment servant, shall be calculated at the rate of half months\n\nemoluments for every completed six monthly period of qualifying service.\n\nThus, the period of six monthly qualifying service is taken as one unit to\n\ncalculate the service gratuity. It is in continuation thereof, that sub-rule (3) of\n\nRule 49 provides that in calculating the length of of qualifying service,\n\nfraction of a year equal to three months and above shall be treated as\n\ncompleted one-half year and reckoned as qualifying service. If one has to\n\ncorrectly understand the import of Rule 49 (3), then one has to read it\n\nharmoniously with Rule 49 (1). Sub-rule (3) only clarifies as to how fraction\n\nof a year equal to three months and above has to be construed while\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nreckoning the qualifying service for the purpose contemplated under Rule\n\n49. It states that for the purposes of taking into consideration the service put\n\nin by an incumbent which does not amount to one full calendar year, how\n\n.\n\nsaid period has to be calculated for determining the qualifying service. All\n\nthat this sub-section provides is this that fraction of a year equal to three\n\nmonths and above shall be treated as completed one-half year and\n\nreckoned as qualifying service. To understand it better, the following four\n\nillustrations are given:-\n\n\"1. Candidate 'A' superannuates after putting in nine\n\nyears two months and twenty nine days of service;\n\n2. Candidate 'B' superannuates after putting in nine\nyears three months of service;\n\n3. Candidate 'C' superannuates after putting in nine\n\nyears eight months and twenty eight days of service;\nand\n\n4. Candidate 'D' superannuates after putting in nine\n\nyears and nine months of service.\"\n\n14. In the case of the first candidate who has put in nine years two\n\nmonths and twenty nine days of service, for the period of qualifying service\n\nof nine years, the gratuity shall be calculated by taking each six months as a\n\nunit, meaning thereby that for nine years, the petitioner gets eighteen six\n\nmonthly period/units. In addition to the nine years of service, such a\n\ncandidate has also put in two months and twenty nine days of service.\n\nHowever, as this service rendered by the candidate does not amount to\n\nfraction of a year equal to three months and above, therefore, he does not\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nget any benefit of this service rendered by him and for the purposes of\n\ncalculating the gratuity etc., his service has to be construed as having put in\n\neighteen six monthly period/units with the Department.\n\n.\n\n15. Now, coming to the second candidate who has completed nine\n\nyears and three months of service, he will get eighteen six monthly\n\nperiod/units for nine years of service and as thereafter, he has put in three\n\nmonths of service, the same shall be treated as a completed one-half year\n\nand reckoned as qualifying service, meaning thereby that for the purpose of\n\ncalculating gratuity etc., such an incumbent would be deemed to have put in\n\nnineteen six monthly period/units of qualifying service. However, still such\n\nan incumbent cannot get the benefit of pension because even by giving him\n\nthis benefit, in all, he gets only nineteen blocks of six monthly period of\n\nqualifying service, which do not constitute ten years.\n\n16. Now, coming to the third candidate, who has completed nine\n\nyears eight months and twenty eights days of service, such an incumbent\n\nwill get nineteen six monthly period of qualifying service for having put in\n\nnine years and six months of service but for the remaining period of two\n\nmonths and twenty eight days, he will not get any benefit as this does not\n\namount fraction of a year more than three years. Therefore, such an\n\nincumbent also cannot be held entitled for service for want of completed\n\nqualifying service.\n\n17. Now, when we come to the fourth incumbent, who has\n\ncompleted nine years and nine months of service, such a candidate will get\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nnineteen six monthly units of qualifying service and in addition as he has put\n\nin three months of service thereafter, this fraction of a year of three months\n\nshall be treated as a completed one-half year and reckoned as a qualifying\n\n.\n\nservice so as to take the completed six monthly units of qualifying service of\n\nsaid incumbent to be twenty in numbers. As these six monthly period of\n\nqualifying service become twenty in numbers and each group comprises of\n\nsix monthly period, then, but natural, the incumbent will be held entitled to\n\nreceive pension as twenty complete six monthly period of qualifying service\n\nmeans ten years of service.\n\n18. Therefore, it is evident that in terms of the provisions of Rule 49\n\n(3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, an incumbent can get the benefit of\n\nqualifying service for the fraction of a year equal to three months and above\n\nfor pension provided such an incumbent has put in more than nine years\n\nand nine months of service.\n\n19. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Union of India and others\n\nVersus Gandiba Behera, 2019 SCC Online SC 1444, while dealing with a\n\nsimilar situation, has been pleased to hold that on a plain reading of the\n\nRule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, it was evident that the Rule\n\ncontemplated one time benefit in case of service of more than three months\n\nin fraction of a year and it rejected the contention that if within a period of\n\none year an employee has served more than six months, then employment\n\nterm ought to be computed as twice the period and one year in two\n\nbranches and one year ought to be added to the service. This contention\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nwas rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court while holding that the provisions\n\nof Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules contemplated one time benefit in\n\ncase of service of more than three months in fraction of a year.\n\n.\n\n20. It is relevant to refer to the provisions of the Swamy's Hand\n\nBook, 2018 in this regard, which also refer to 'rounding off' and provides as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"8. Rounding off- Qualifying service of pension/gratuity\n\nis calculated and expressed in completed half-years.\nFractions equal to three months and above shall be\ntreated as one half-year. Fraction of less than 3 months\n\nwill be ignored, e.g.-\n\nPeriod of Service Six- Period of Service Six-\n\nYears Month Day monthly Years Months Day monthly\ns s periods s periods\n\n9 8 29 19 9 9 00 20\n19 8 20 39 18 9 00 40\n24 7 15 49 24 10 00 50\n\n32 5 25 65 32 9 00 66\n\n(Swamy's Hand Book, 2018, Section 24 Clause-III)\n\n21. Thus, it is evident from what has been discussed hereinabove,\n\nthat Rule 49 (1) of the CCS (Pension) Rules has to be construed\n\nharmoniously with Rule 49 (3) thereof and when one reads the said\n\nprovisions with the clarifications which have been given by the Department\n\nof Personnel, dated 13.10.1983, the only conclusion which can be drawn is\n\nthat an incumbent who has not completed ten years of service and is thus\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS\nnot qualified for receiving pension, can be held to be entitled to the said\n\nbenefit only if such an incumbent has put in more than nine years nine\n\nmonths of service in the respondent-Department. Any view taken to the\n\n.\n\ncontrary will do injustice with the letter and spirit of the provisions of Rule 49\n\n(1) and Rule 49 (3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules.\n\n22. Accordingly, we hold that the view which has been taken by the\n\nDivision Bench in CWP No.7708 of 2012, titled\nPrem Sagar Versus State\n\nof H.P. & others\n(supra) is the correct view with regard to the interpretation\n\nof Rule 49(3) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972, whereas, the view which\n\nhas been expressed by the Division Bench in State of H.P. Versus\n\nJoginder Singh, [2012] (3) Him.\n\nL.R. 1288 (supra), so also in CWP No.\n\n8786 of 2012-I, titled as\nLashkari Ram Vs. State of H.P. and others\n, decided\n\non 8th May, 2013 cannot be treated as the right precedent, especially in view\n\nof the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Union of India and\n\nothers Versus Gandiba Behera, 2019 SCC Online SC 1444. Reference is\n\nanswered accordingly.\n\n(Mohammad Rafiq)\nChief Justice\n\n(Ajay Mohan Goel)\nJudge\n\n(Jyotsna Rewal Dua)\nJudge\nMay 13, 2022\n(bhupender)\n\n::: Downloaded on - 13/05/2022 20:06:48 :::CIS",
