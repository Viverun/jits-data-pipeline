Habeas Corpus Petition No.69/2016\nAarab Khan Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.\n\nDate of judgment :: 1st August, 2016\n\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE GOPAL KRISHAN VYAS\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE G.R. MOOLCHANDANI\n\nMr. LD Khatri, for the petitioner.\n\nMr. SK Vyhas, AAG\n\n<><><>\n\nBy the Court (Per Hon'ble Mr. Justice G.K. Vyas):\n\nThe instant habeas corpus writ petition has been filed\n\nby the petitioner detenu Aarab Khan, resident of Vikeri\n\n(Chhod), Police Station Sangad, District Jaisalmer to\n\nchallenge the order dated 11.12.2015 (Annex.1) passed by\n\nthe District Magistrate, Jaisalmer an d order dated\n\n22.12.2015 (Annex.4) passed by the respondent no.2 Dy.\n\nSecretary, Home (Disaster Management), Department,\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan, Secretariat, Jaipur by which the\n\nState Government confirmed the order dated 11.12.2015\n\npassed by the District Magistrate while exercising powers\n\nunder\nSection 3(2)\nof the Rajasthan Prevention of Anti-\n\nSocial Activities Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the\n\nAct of 2006 for short) whereby the petitioner was detained\nfor one year.\n\nAs per the facts of the case, the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Jaisalmer submitted details of criminal activities and\n\ncases registered against the petitioner to the office of the\n\nDistrict Magistrate, Jaisalmer for taking action against him\n\nunder Section 3 of the Rajasthan Prevention of Anti Social,\n\nAct 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 2006 for\n\nshort). Upon receiving such information, the District\n\nMagistrate, Jaisalmer passed an order by invoking the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 2006 against the petitioner for one\n\nyear.\n\nAfter passing detention order, the petitioner was\n\ndetained and a notice was served upon the petitioner on the\n\nsame day that if you want to say anything you may file\n\nrepresentation against the detention order and the said\n\ndetention order and representation will be placed before the\n\nadvisory board and you may appear before the advisory\n\nboard to make your submissions against the order of\n\ndetention.\n\nIn the report submitted by the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Jaisalmer it was informed that 11 cases were\n\nregistered against the petitioner-detenue right from 2nd\n\nSept., 2013 to 30th Jan., 2015 for offence committed by\n\nhim under\nSection 136\nof the Electricity Act and other\n\noffences of\nIPC\n.\nThe petitioner detenue filed his representation to the\n\ngovernment and same as placed before the advisory board\n\nconstituted by the Government under\nSection 10\nof the\n\nAct of 2006. The petitioner was granted an opportunity to\n\nappear before the advisory board to make his submissions.\n\nThe petitioner detenue filed his written submissions\n\nbefore the advisory board and submitted that he has been\n\nfalsely involved in the criminal case but already released on\n\nbail. It is also submitted that no offence has been\n\ncommitted by him so as to fall under the definition of\n\n\"dangerous person\". According to the petitioner last case\n\nwas registered against him in the month of Jan., 2015\n\nwhereas detention order was passed after 11 months in the\n\nmonth of Dec., 2015. The detune appeared before the\n\nadvisory board and submit that he is illiterate person,\n\nwhatever material sent to him alongwith the notice cannot\n\nbe understood by him nor reasons incorporated in the\n\ndetention order can be understand, therefore, it is prayed\n\nthat the detention order may not be approved by the\n\nboard.\n\nThe advisory board after providing an opportunity of\n\nhearing rejected the prayer of the petitioner and approved\n\nthe order of detention dated 11.12.2015 passed by the\n\ncompetent authority. The State Government after approval\n\nissued the impugned order dated 22.12.2015 whereby the\norder passed by the District Magistrate, Jaisalmer was\n\nconfirmed to detain the petitioner for one year.\n\nIn this writ petition, the petitioner is challenging the\n\norder dated 11.12.2015 passed by the District Magistrate,\n\nJaisalmer (Annex.1) and the order of the State Government\n\ndated 22.12.2015 (Annex.4) whereby the order of\n\ndetention passed by the District Magistrate, Jaisalmer was\n\napproved.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\norders Annex.1 an d 4 are illegal because District\n\nMagistrate, Jaisalmer as well as the State Government has\n\nnot applied its mind while declaring the petitioner as\n\n\"dangerous person\" as per the Act of 2006. Learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner submits that although 11 cases\n\nwere registered against the petitioner detenue for offence\n\nunder\nSection 136\nof the Electricity Act and other offences\n\nof\nIPC\nbut in none of the cases, the petitioner has been\n\nconvicted, more so, he was granted bail by the learned trial\n\ncourt and cases are pending. While inviting attention\n\ntowards the fact that last case was registered against the\n\npetitioner detenue on 30.1.2015 and order of detention\n\nwas passed in the month of Dec., 2015, it is submitted that\n\npreceding one year from the date of detention order no\n\ncase was registered against the petitioner, therefore, the\n\nfinding arrived at by the District Magistrate, Jaisalmer and\nState Government so as to treat the petitioner as\n\n\"dangerous person\" is not sustainable in law. The learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner invited our attention towards the\n\nimportant aspect of the case that in the definition of\n\n\"dangerous person\" it is specifically provided that only\n\nthose person can be treated \"dangerous person\" under the\n\nprovisions of this Act, who either by himself or as member\n\nor leader of a gang, habitually commits, or a attempts to\n\ncommit or abets the commission of any of the offences\n\npunishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the\nIndian\n\nPenal Code\n, 1860 (Central Act No.45 of 1860) can be\n\ntreated a dangerous person but in this Section the\n\nElectricity Act is nowhere incorporated by the legislature,\n\ntherefore, as per the definition of\nSection 2(c)\nof the Act of\n\n2006 , the finding given by the District Magistrate,\n\nJaisalmer and approved by the State Government to treat\n\nthe petitioner detenue as \"dangerous person\" is not in\n\nconsonance with law. It is also submitted that all above\n\nsubmissions were made before the advisory board but\n\nadvisory board did not consider the prayer of the petitioner\n\nand in very casual manner approved the detention order,\n\ntherefore, both the orders may kindly be quashed. In\n\nsupport of his arguments, the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner invited our attention towards following judgment:\n\n(\ni) Bhanwar Lal Pareek Vs. State of Rajasthan &\nOrs.\nreported in 2016 (2) Cr.L.R. (Raj.) 954;\n(ii) Rekha Vs. State of Tamilnadu & Anr. reported in\n2011 (Suppl) Cr.L.R. (SC) 128\n\n(\niii) Munagala Yadamma Vs. State of Andhra\nPradesh & Ors\nreported in 2012 Cr.L.R. (S.C.)\n(iv) Manohar Lal Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors\nreported in 2013 (3) RLW 1864 (Raj.)\n\n(v) Abdul Nasar Adam Ismail Vs. State of\nMaharashtra & Ors., reported in (2013) 4 SCC\n(\nvi) Jai Prakash Vs. District Magistarte, Bulandshahr\nUP & Ors\nreported in 1993 Cri. LJ 303\n\n(vii) Ummu Sabeena Vs. State of Kerla reported in\n2011 (suppl) Cr.L.R. (SC) 689.\n\nPer contra, learned Addl. Advocate General-cum\n\nGovernment Advocate has argued that the antecedent of\n\nthe detenue were considered objectively and after due\n\napplication of mind, the detention order was passed, which\n\nis affirmed by the advisory board. The detention order was\n\npassed on account of various criminal activities of the\n\npetitioner to cause eminent danger to the maintenance of\n\nthe public order, that a need was fall to invoke provisions of\n\nthe Act of 2006. It is also submitted that the activities of\n\nthe petitioner detenue crated problem for national\n\nsecurity, so also, for power generation system in the entire\n\narea, which is evident from the fact that 11 cases were\n\nregistered against him, which are still pending. The cases\n\nwere registered for theft of cable etc of the wind mills by\nthe petitioner. Due to the criminal activities of the detenue\n\na fear has been created among persons working and\n\nestablishing wind mills for generating electricity, therefore,\n\nafter recording complete reasons, the District Magistrate,\n\nJaisalmer passed an order of detention while exercising\n\npowers under\nSection 3(c)\nof the Act of 2006. It is also\n\nsubmitted that as per the material available on record it is\n\nobvious that District Magistrate has rightly held petitioner\n\nto be \"dangerous person\" because he was involved in\n\nvarious criminal activities at the Indo-Pak border and\n\ndisturbed production of electricity, which is used for BSF\n\nand Air Force. According to the learned Addl. Advocate\n\nGeneral the cases registered against the petitioner clearly\n\nspeaks volumes of his activities prejudicial to the public\n\norder, therefore, the detention order has been passed after\n\nbeing satisfied upon material placed before the competent\n\nauthority. The District Magistrate passed the order of\n\ndetention after subjective satisfaction which clearly reflects\n\nfrom the grounds incorporated in the reply. The crux of the\n\nargument of the learned Addl. Advocate General is that due\n\nto registration of number of cases against the petitioner\n\ndetenue from 2013 to 2015, the District Magistrate\n\nexercised its powers under the Act of 2006 so as to\n\nmaintain public order. Against the detention order passed\n\nby the District Magistrate, Jaisalmer, the representation of\nthe petitioner detenue was objectively considered by the\n\nadvisory board and after due deliberations the advisory\n\nboard approved the order of detention for a period of one\n\nyear, thereafter, State Government confirmed the order\n\ntherefore, this writ petition may be dismissed. In support of\n\nhis argument, the learned Addl. Advocate General invited\n\nour attention towards the judgment in the case of Dinu\n\nKhan Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors. (DB Habeas Corpus\n\nPetition No.7824/2014), decided on 20.3.2015, in the case\n\nof Babu Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan (DB Habeas Corus\n\nPetition No.4021/2015), decided on 19.5.2015 and in the\n\ncase of Hari Singh Vs. State of Rajasthan (D.B. Habeas\n\nCorpus Petition No.5525/2015), decided on 13.7.2015 and\n\nsubmits that the instant petition may kindly be dismissed.\n\nAfter hearing the learned counsel for the parties, we\n\nhave perused the record placed before us. Undoubtedly,\n\nfollowing cases were registered against the petitioner,\n\ndetails of those cases are as follows:\n\n\"FIR no.75 dated 2.9.2013 was registered under\n\nSection 136\nof the Electricity Act for the charge of\nstealing away cables from the windmills plants. In the\nsaid case recovery of theft articles was made. After\ninvestigation challan was filed\nSection 136\nof the\nElectricity Act and the matter is under trial in the court\nof District & Sessions Judge, Jailsalmer. However, this\ndid not put an end to his criminal activities affecting\nthe public order adversely.\n\nFIR No.88 dated 26.09.2013 was registered\nunder\nsection 136\nof the Electricity Act for the charge\nof stealing away cables from the windmills plants. In\nthe said case recovery of theft articles was made.\nAfter investigation challan was filed\nsection 136\nof the\nElectricity Act and the matter is under trial in the court\nof District & Sessions Judge, Jailsalmer. However, this\ndid not put an end to his criminal activities affecting\nthe public order adversely.\n\nFIR No.94 dated 23.10.2013 was registered at\nPolice Station Sangad under\nSection 394\n,\n,\nIPC and 136 of the\nElectricity Act\nas the detenue and\nothers had stolen away cable from the wind mill. In\nthis case the stolen cable was recovered. Aft e r\ninvestigation challan was filed and trial is pending in\nthe court of District & Sessions Judge, Jaisalmer.\n\nA case No.99 dated 22.11.2013 under\nSection\n,\n,\n,\n,\nIPC and\nsection 136\nof\nElectricity Act was registered. At the instance of\naccused persons 6 Kg of cable was recovered. After\ninvestigation challan was filed and trial is pending in\nthe court of District & Sessions Judge, Jailsalmer.\n\nA case No.100 dated 22.11.2013 under\nSection\n,\nof Electricity Act was registered. At the\ninstance of accused persons cable weighing 51 Kg and\n280 Grams was recovered. After investigation challan\nwas filed and trial is pending in the court of District &\nSession Judge, Jaisalmer.\n\nA case No.105 dated 20.12.2013 under\nSection\nof Electricity Act was registered. At the instance\nof accused persons 5 Kg cables were recovered. After\ninvestigation challan was filed and trial is pending in\nthe court of District & Sessions Judge, Jaisalmer.\n\nCase No.1 dated 04.01.2014 was registered\nunder\nSection 137\n,\n,\nof Electricity Act alleging\nthat the detenu and ors stole away cables from\nwindmill plant. After investigation challan was filed\nand the matter is under trial in the court of District\nand Sessions Judge, Jaisalmer.\n\nA case No.71 dated 23.06.2014 under\nSection\n,\nof Electricity Act was registered. At the\ninstance of accused persons 100 Kg cables were\nrecovered. After investigation challan was filed and\ntrial is pending in the court of District & Sessions\nJudge, Jaisalmer.\n\nA case No.89 dated 12.08.2014 under\nSection\n,\nand\nof Electricity Act was registered. At\nthe instance of accused persons 4 Kg copper wire\nwere recovered. After investigating challan was filed\nand trial is pending in the court of District & Sessions\nJudge,Jaisalmer.\n\nA case No.10 dated 24.01.2015 under\nSection\nIPC and\nsection 136\nof Electricity Act was\nregistered. At the instance of accused persons 7 Kg\ncopper wire were recovered. After investigation\nchallan was filed and trial is pending in the court of\nDistrict & Sessions Judge, Jaisalmer.\n\nCase No.8 dated 30.01.2015 was registered\nunder\nsection 379\nIPC read with\nsection 136\nof the\nElectricity Act. The accused were arrested and from\ntheir possession 10 Kg cables were recovered. After\ninvestigation challan under\nSection 457\nand\nElectricity Act was filed.\"\n\nUpon perusal of the above details of the cases it is\n\nobvious that from 2.9.2013 to 30.1.2015, 11 cases were\n\nregistered against the petitioner, but in none of the case,\n\nthe petitioner has been convicted, all the cases are\n\npending. It is also very important to observe that all the 11\n\ncases were registered under\nSection 136\nof the Electricity\n\nAct as well as for in some cases alongwith other offence of\n\nIPC\n. No doubt, the offences alleged to have been\n\ncommitted by the petitioner are such as to attribute\n\npunishment under the\nElectricity Act\nas well as\nIPC\n, but for\n\ntaking recourse to preventive detention, the District\n\nMagistrate and its authorities were under obligation to\n\nconsider the definition of \"dangerous person\" enumerated\n\nin\nSection 2(c)\nof the Act of 2006, which reads as under:\n\n\"(c) 'dangerous person' means a person, who\neither by himself or as member or leader of a\ngang, habitually commits, or a attempts to\ncommit or abets the commission of any of the\noffences punishable under Chapter XVI or\nChapter XVII of the\nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860\n(Central Act No.45 of 1860) or any of the\noffences publishable under\nChapter V of the\nArms Act, 1959\n(Central Act No.54 of 1959) or\nany of the offences punishable under first\nproviso to sub-sec. (1), and sub-sec. (1-A) of\n\nSec. 51\nof the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972\n(Central Act No.53 of 1972) or any offence\npunishable under\nsec. 67\nof the Information\nTechnology Act, 2000 (Central Act No.21 of\n2000) .\n\nUpon perusal of the above definition it will reveal that\n\nlegislature in its wisdom has expressly included specific acts\n\nenacted for other criminal activities in addition to the\n\noffences punishable under Chapter XVI and XVII of the\n\nIndian Penal Code\nbut the\nElectricity Act\nis not included in\n\nthe definition of \"dangerous person\" whereas other acts\n\nlike Arms Act, Wild Life Protection Act and Information and\n\nTechnology Act are included alongwith the offences of\nIPC\n\nin the definition of \"dangerous person\". Here in this case,\n\nout of 11 cases, 7 cases were registered under\nSections\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the Electricity Act. In\n\nremaining cases, the cases were registered under the\n\nElectricity Act\nas well as for the offence of\nIPC\n, but all the\n\n11 cases are still pending, in none of the case, the\n\npetitioner has been convicted, more so, has been granted\n\nbail by the court.\n\nUpon consideration of the definition of the \"dangerous\nperson\" under\nSection 2(c)\nof the Act of 2006, the\n\npetitioner cannot be categorized as \"dangerous person\" or a\n\n\"habitual offender\" of warranting any arrest and detention\n\nby exercise of powers under\nSection 3(1)\nof the Act of\n\n2006 because in all the cases, the petitioner is facing trial.\n\nIt is also undisputed fact that last case was registered\n\nagainst the petitioner detenue on 30.1.2015 and order of\n\ndetention was passed in the month of Dec., 2015. Meaning\n\nthereby, preceding one year from the date of detention no\n\ncase was registered against the petitioner. There is\n\nstrength in the argument of the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner that petitioner's case does not fall under the\n\ndefinition of \"dangerous person\" for the reason that in none\n\nof the cases he has been convicted, so also, from last one\n\nyear from the date of detention order no case was\n\nregistered against him, so also, the offence under\nElectricity\n\nAct\nis not included to define any person as \"dangerous\n\nperson\".\n\nIn our opinion, at the time of passing any detention\n\norder, the definition of \"dangerous person\" was to be seen\n\nobjectively by the District Magistrate, Jaisalmer as well as\n\nby the State Government and advisory board. It is true\n\nthat if any person became dangerous for public order, then\n\nthe detention order could be passed by invoking the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 2006 but at the same time, the\nauthorities cannot be permitted to ignore\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution of India which is the fundamental right granted\n\nby the Constitution of India. The right of liberty and\n\nfreedom granted under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia implies that before a person is imprisoned he should\n\nbe given full opportunity of hearing and his expression\n\nshould be considered properly. Here in this case, order of\n\ndetention has been passed for the reason that petitioner is\n\ninvolved to commit offence under\nElectricity Act\nin the\n\nborder area and 11 cases were registered against him\n\nwithin span of one and half years for theft of electricity, but\n\nthis Court cannot lose its sight of the fact that at the time of\n\npassing detention order it was the duty of the District\n\nMagistrate, Jaisalmer to consider the fact that from last one\n\nyear no case was registered against him even though he\n\nwas granted bail in all the cases. The District Magistrate,\n\nJaisalmer and State authorities were under obligation to\n\nconsider definition of \"dangerous person\" enumerated\n\nunder\nSection 2(c)\nof the Act of 2006, objectively but here\n\nin this case it has not been considered properly while\n\npassing order for detention to declare the petitioner as\n\n\"dangerous person\".\n\nWe have perused the order of advisory board also.\n\nThe advisory board considered the definition of \"dangerous\n\nperson\" enumerated in the Act of 20016 and held that even\nif a person committed offence under Wild Life Protection Act\n\nand Information Technology Act can be detained, therefore,\n\nin this case, the detune who has committed offence under\n\nChapter XVI and XVII of\nIPC\napart from other offences\n\nunder the\nElectricity Act\n, as such, the order of detention is\n\njustified. The advisory board although approved the order\n\nof detention but upon perusal of order of approval dated\n\n11.1.2016 it can be said that advisory board has not only\n\napproved the order, but virtually gave judicial verdict on\n\nthe basis of various judgments placed before the advisory\n\nboard for consideration by the Government, but this court\n\ncannot lose sight of the fact that before advisory board the\n\npetitioner was present in person, no lawyer appeared on his\n\nbehalf to submit the judgments in defence by this Court and\n\nby the Hon'ble Supreme Court in which it is held that in the\n\nevent of passing detention order, th e definition of\n\n\"dangerous person\" should be considered objectively on the\n\nbasis of material available on record.\n\nIt is true that in the case of Dinu Khan and Babu\n\nSingh (supra), the Division Bench of this Court dismissed\n\nthe writ petition filed by the detenue who was involved in\n\nthe case of\nElectricity Act\nand this Court dismissed the writ\n\npetition but upon considering the facts of the present case,\n\nit emerges that from last preceding one year from the date\n\nof detention order dated 11.12.2015 no case was registered\nagainst the petitioner for committing theft under\nSection\nor other Sections of the Electricity Act, therefore, at the\n\ntime of passing order of detention it was the duty of the\n\nDistrict Magistrate and State Government as well as the\n\nAdvisory Board to consider the said fact, so also, the fact\n\nthat all the cases registered against the petitioner are still\n\npending, but ignoring the said fact the order of detention\n\nwas passed and consequently, approved by the State\n\nGovernment and advisory board. It is true that power can\n\nbe exercised under\nSection 3\nof the Act of 2006 for passing\n\ndetention order if any person became dangerous for public\n\norder but at the same time, it is the duty of the authorities\n\nto pass order of detention after taking into consideration\n\nthe entire facts in right perspective.\nThe Act\nof 2006 is\n\nenacted by the State legislature in which the definition of\n\n\"dangerous person\" is enumerated under\nSection 2(c)\nof\n\nthe Act in which alongwith offences of\nIPC\nother Acts are\n\nincluded but\nElectricity Act\nis not included so as to declare a\n\nperson as \"dangerous person\", therefore, only on the basis\n\nof cases registered under\nElectricity Act\n, the detention order\n\nis not sustainable in law. The entire record is to be seen for\n\nthe said purpose.\n\nIn the case of Manohar Lal (supra), the coordinate\n\nbench of this Court while considering number of judgments\n\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court gave the following verdict,\nwhich reads as under:\n\n\"8. It has also been held by the Apex Court\nin case of\nMadhu Garg Vs. Union of India & Anr.\n\n(2005 (2) WLC (SC) Criminal 109) that when one\nof the ground of detention is found to be based\non irrelevant materials not germane for passing\nthe order of detention, the entire order of\ndetention shall stand vitiated in law.\n\n9. So far as the definition of \"dangerous\nperson\" is concerned,\nSection 2(c)\nof the said\nAct reads as under :-\n\n\"2(c) \"dangerous person\" means a\nperson, who either by himself or as member\nor leader of a gang, habitually commits, or\nattempts to commit or abets the\ncommission of any of the offences\npunishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter\nXVII of the\nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860\n(Central Act No. 45 of 1860) or any of the\noffences punishable under\nChapter V of the\nArms Act, 1959\n(Central Act No. 54 of 1959)\nor any of the offences punishable under\nfirst proviso to sub-section (1), and\nsubsection (1A), of\nsection 51\nof the Wild\nLife (Protection) Act, 1972 (Central Act No.\n53 of 1972) or any offence punishable\nunder\nsection 67\nof the Information\nTechnology Act, 2000 (Central Act No. 21 of\n2000) \"\n\n10. T he powers of the State\nGovernment to make orders for detaining\ncertain persons under the said Act have\nbeen conferred under\nSection 3\nof the said\nAct. In this regard, it is pertinent to note\nthat the District Magistrate of the\nconcerned area could also pass the order of\ndetention under\nSection 3(2)\nof the said\nAct, if he is satisfied with respect to any\nperson that such person was acting in the\nmanner prejudicial to the maintenance of\npublic order. As per\nSection 3(4)\na person is\ndeemed to be acting in any manner\nprejudicial to the maintenance of the public\norder, if such person is engaged in the\nactivities interalia as a dangerous person\nwhich are likely to effect adversely the\nmaintenance of public order.\n\n11. Now so far as the facts of the\npresent case are concerned, the respondent\nNo. 2 had passed the order dated 21.11.11\nin exercise of his power under\nSection 3(2)\n\nof the said Act, on his having been allegedly\nsatisfied that the petitioner was a\ndangerous person, and his activities were\nlikely to effect adversely the maintenance\nof the public order. In the annexure to the\nsaid order, the respondent No. 2 had shown\nthat there were seven cases pending\nagainst the petitioner. Now admittedly, the\npetitioner was already discharged from the\ncase No. 10/11 shown at serial No. 6 on the\ndate of passing of the said order and that\nno charge-sheet was filed in case No.\n193/11 shown at serial No.7 of the said\norder. The other cases shown pending\nagainst the petitioner were the offences of\nsimilar nature, registered under\nSection 457\n\nand\nof IPC,and in all the said cases, the\npetitioner was already released on bail by\nthe concerned court. If the cases at serial\nNo. 6 and 7 are not taken in t o\nconsideration, the last case registered\nagainst the petitioner being case No.\n303/10 shown at serial No. 5 was\nregistered on 4.12.10, and the impugned\norder was passed by the respondent No.2\nunder\nSection 3(2)\nof the said Act on\n21.11.11 for detaining him. As rightly\nsubmitted by the learned counsel Mr.\nYogesh Kumar Sharma for the petitioners,\nrelying upon the decision of the Apex Court,\nin case of\nRajinder Arora Vs. Union of India\n& Ors.\n((2006) 4 SCC 796), there was no\nexplanation coming forth from the\nrespondents as to what activities, adverse\nto the maintenance of the public order were\nfound to have been committed by the\npetitioner, requiring his detention and as to\nwhy there was so much of delay in passing\nthe order of detention for the alleged illegal\nactivities after 4 .1 2 .1 0 . Th e learned\nGovernment counsel also was not in a\nposition to explain as to what were the\ncompelling circumstances r e q u ir i n g\ndetention of the petitioner on 21.11.11.\nUnder the circumstances and as held by the\nApex Court, in the aforesaid decision,\npassing of the detention order after the\ndelay of more than one year to the alleged\noffence committed by the petitioner itself\nwas a ground to set aside the detention\norder.\"\n\nOn th e basis of above adjudication and upon\n\nconsideration of the facts, the order of detention is not\n\nsustainable in law, therefore, this habeas corpus petition is\n\nherby allowed. The order dated 11.12.2015 (Annex.1)\n\npassed by th e District Magistrate, Jaisalmer while\n\nexercising powers under\nSection 3(2)\nof the Act of 2006\n\nwhich is subsequently approved by the advisory board and\n\naffirmed by the State Government vide order dated\n\n22.12.2015 (Annex.4) are hereby quashed and set aside,\n\nthe petitioner detenu Aarab Khan shall be released\n\nforthwith if not needed to any other case.\n\n(G.R.
