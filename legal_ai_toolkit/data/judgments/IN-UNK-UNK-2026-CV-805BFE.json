The brief facts leading to the filing of this petition are that M/s\n\n Canara Bank lodged an information in writing before the first respondent,\n\n based on which a First Information Report was registered in\n\n RC0322021A0009 dated 17.05.2021, for the alleged offences under Section\n\n 120B read with 420 \nIPC\n and \nsection 13 (2)\n read with 13 (1) (d) of the\n\n \nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988\n.\n\n 2.1. The gist of the information is that M/s Air Carnival Private Limited,\n\n represented by its Directors S. Irud a y a n a t h a n (A1), the petitioner herein, and\n\n his wife, Mrs. Lima Rose (A2), applied for a loan by offering to create an\n\n equitable mortgage of its immovable property measuring 3.75 acres along with\n\n a building on S.F.Nos. 298/1 and 298/3 in Myleripalayam Village,\n\n 2/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n Madukkarai Taluk, Coimbatore District. The Directors also acted as personal\n\n guarantors. Based on the application dated 04.06.2016, a term loan of Rs. 4.90\n\n Crores was granted along with a bank guarantee, a sum of Rs. 3.05 Crores on\n\n 01.06.2016; an overdraft facility of Rs. 4.70 Crores on 27.10.2016; and a\n\n temporary overdraft of Rs. 1.00 Crore on 31.03.2017, totaling Rs. 13.65\n\n Crores. The loan account was classified as 'Non-Performing Asset' (NPA) on\n\n 29.06.2017 and was reported as a fraudulent account on 27.11.2019. The\n\n company and its Directors wilfully and dishonestly defrauded the Bank by\n\n conspiring to divert and siphon the loan amount, causing wrongful loss of Rs.\n\n 13.65 Crores to the Bank and wrongful gain to themselves.\n\n 2.2. After an investigation, the final report was submitted. The report\n\n states that the 2 Director, M r s . Li m a Ros e, had no criminal intent or\n nd\n\n knowledge regarding the mentioned transaction, and therefore her name is\n\n omitted. It also states that there was no criminal intent or knowledge on the\n\n part of the public servants/bank officials concerning the transactions, and the\n\n provisions of the offences under the \nPrevention of Corruption Act, 1988\n, were\n\n dropped. Furthermore, it explains that initially, while the petitioner,\n\n Irud a y a n a t h a n , operated his business as a proprietorship, he showed higher\n\n contributions when he transitioned to a partnership, whereas the contributions\n\n 3/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n of the other partners were minimal. Later, when the partnership was converted\n\n into a company registered under the \nCompanies Act, 2013\n, the property\n\n offered as security remained in his personal name and was not transferred to\n\n the company's name.\n\n 2.3. Further, by availing the loans on the specified dates, the company\n\n did not adhere to its original plan, and the primary sureties in the form of\n\n goods that should have been created were not created. On the other hand, the\n\n loan proceeds were siphoned off to other accounts to create four Fixed\n\n Deposits, which were subsequently used as margin money for bank\n\n guarantees. Subsequently, several bank guarantees were obtained in favor of\n\n M/s Anjali Hotels Private Limited, M/s Airports Authority of India,\n\n Coimbatore, Air India Air Transport Services Limited, New Delhi, ATR\n\n Eastern Support Private Limited, Singapore. Additionally, the loan amount\n\n was diverted to other institutions such as M/s Coimbatore Marine College,\n\n Mangalore Marine College, and Technology. However, the accused failed to\n\n repay the principal and interest, leading to the accounts being classified as\n\n NPA. In the meantime, the company went into liquidation and is now\n\n represented by the Official Liquidator. The matter is currently pending before\n\n the National Company Law Tribunal, Chennai. Therefore, finding that the\n\n 4/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC is made out, the final report has been filed.\n\n 2.4. It is stated that, in the meantime, by a communication dated\n\n 12.01.2022, Canara Bank offered to accept a sum of Rupees 12 Crores as full\n\n and final settlement, on the condition that the amount be paid in installments\n\n within the specified timeline, with the final installment of Rupees 3 Crores to\n\n be paid on or before 31.03.2022. In addition, the legal expenses and\n\n CIRP/liquidation expenses were also to be paid. It is explicitly mentioned in\n\n the offer that the account will be considered closed only after all direct and\n\n indirect liabilities in the name of the firm/borrower/guarantors are settled. It is\n\n further stated that the One Time Settlement will not affect ongoing criminal\n\n proceedings initiated by the CBI/Police authorities. The One-Time Settlement\n\n (OTS) will be without prejudice to the rights of the CBI/Police to investigate\n\n or prosecute and shall not hinder the continuation or resolution of any pending\n\n criminal proceedings, if any.\n\n 2.5. The petitioner is said to have completely paid the loan amount of\n\n Rs.12 Crores on 02.03.2022, and there are no dues whatsoever to the Bank,\n\n with the civil liability amicably settled. However, due to the clause originally\n\n 5/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n contained in the memorandum of understanding, the Bank is not coming\n\n forward to join in the filing of application for compounding under \nSection 320\n\n of Cr.P.C. Therefore, contending that the entire action does not constitute any\n\n criminal offence and that the settlement of dues amicably should be\n\n considered, and the proceedings be quashed.\n\n C.Submissions of the learned counsel:\n\n \n3. Heard, M s . K a d a m b r i Sure s h , the learned counsel appearing on behalf\n\n of the petitioner. Firstly she would submit that the amount was borrowed after\n\n furnishing due security. There was never an intention to cheat the bank. It was\n\n a failed venture and thus the account slipped into NPA. The petitioner had\n\n made all earnest efforts and has settled the loan amount. Except for the brief\n\n period of default, there was no dishonest intention for the petitioner. The\n\n learned counsel would rely upon various Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court of India, more specifically \nK.Bharthi Devi V. State of Telangana1\n and\n\n \nN.S.Gnaneshwaran Vs. Inspector of Police & Anr.2\n and would submit that\n\n the proceedings are liable to be quashed.\n\n 1 (2024) INSC 750\n 2 (2025) SCCOnLine SC 1257\n\n 6/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n 3.1. Per contr a, Mr. K. Sriniv a s a n , the learned Special Public\n\n Prosecutor, would submit that the legal position in this regard has not been\n\n altered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, and he would rely upon a set of\n\n judgments to argue that, in cases involving bank fraud, the Court should not\n\n invoke jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of Cr.P.C. based on a subsequent\n\n settlement. In fact, when the money originally borrowed is sanctioned for\n\n specific purposes such as purchasing tools, kits, and equipment, which serve\n\n as primary security for the loan, diverting funds for a different purpose and\n\n then defaulting completes the offence of cheating.\n\n 3.2. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 2 nd\n\n respondent/Canara Bank submitted that the entire dues of the Bank have been\n\n settled, and the Bank has no serious objections in considering the petition for\n\n quashing. However, in view of the clause in the memorandum of One Time\n\n Settlement, there was no mandate for the Bank to file a compounding\n\n application before the Trial Court.\n\n D.Consideration and Findings:\n\n 4. This case was heard along with the connected Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and\n\n 30939 of 2024 whereby, this Court considered the arguments made by the\n\n 7/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n learned counsel on either side at length and already all the Judgments relating\n\n to the quashing of cases on settlement of the dues amicably with the Bank,\n\n especially in bank fraud cases have been considered and the following\n\n conclusions are arrived at in respect of the legal position and the same is\n\n reproduced as under :\n\n “In this regard, both sides presented detailed arguments,\n and it is essential to consider the legal position before moving to\n the facts of the present case.

Thus\n essentially it held that while no category can\n be prescribed heinous and serious offences\n of mental depravity, murder, rape, dacoity\n cannot be quashed. Even the victim or the\n victim’s family settled the issues. Similarly\n compromise between victim and the\n offender under Special law of Prevention of\n corruption Act or the offences committed by\n the public servant cannot be quashed. The\n criminal cases having overwhelmingly and\n predominantly civil flavor particularly of\n they arise from commercial financial\n mercantile civil partnership are like\n transactions and the offences arising out of\n matrimony relating to dowry are family\n disputes which are all basically private an\n personal in nature and if the parties have\n resolved the dispute considering that because\n of the possibility firstly the conviction is\n remote and bleak and the continuation of the\n case would put the accused in great\n oppression and prejudice to the accused\n despite full and complete settlement and\n compromise with the victim.

Where the High Court quashes a\n criminal proceeding having regard to the fact that the\n dispute between the offender and the victim has been\n settled although the offences are not compoundable,\n\n 19/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n it does so as in its opinion, continuation of criminal\n proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice\n in the case demands that the dispute between the\n parties is put to an end and peace is restored;\n\n securing the ends of justice being the ultimate\n guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have\n harmful effect on the public and consist in\n wrongdoing that seriously endangers and threatens\n the well-being of the society and it is not safe to\n leave the crime-doer only because he and the victim\n have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim\n has been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have\n been made compoundable in law, with or without the\n permission of the court. In respect of serious offences\n like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., or other offences of\n mental depravity under \nIPC\n or offences of moral\n turpitude under special statutes, like the \nPrevention\n of Corruption Act\n or the offences committed by\n public servants while working in that capacity, the\n settlement between the offender and the victim can\n have no legal sanction at all. However, certain\n offences which overwhelmingly and predominantly\n bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,\n mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or\n such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n matrimony, particularly relating to dowry, etc. or the\n family dispute, where the wrong is basically to the\n victim and the offender and the victim have settled\n all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of\n the fact that such offences have not been made\n compoundable, the High Court may within the\n framework of its inherent power, quash the criminal\n proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it is\n satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is\n hardly any likelihood of the offender being convicted\n and by not quashing the criminal proceedings, justice\n shall be casualty and ends of justice shall be defeated.\n The above list is illustrative and not exhaustive. Each\n case will depend on its own facts and no hard-and-\n fast category can be prescribed.\n\n ......\n\n ......\n\n 61. The position that emerges from the above\n discussion can be summarised thus : the power of the\n\n 20/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR\n or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\n distinct and different from the power given to a\n criminal court for compounding the offences under\n Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide\n plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be\n exercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in\n such power viz. : (i) to secure the ends of justice, or\n\n (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any court. In\n what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\n complaint or FIR may be exercised where the\n offender and the victim have settled their dispute\n would depend on the facts and circumstances of each\n case and no category can be prescribed. However,\n before exercise of such power, the High Court must\n have due regard to the nature and gravity of the\n crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental\n depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.\n cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or\n victim's family and the offender have settled the\n dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and\n have a serious impact on society. Similarly, any\n compromise between the victim and the offender in\n relation to the offences under special statutes like the\n \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the offences\n committed by public servants while working in that\n capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for\n quashing criminal proceedings involving such\n offences. But the criminal cases having\n overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour\n stand on a different footing for the purposes of\n quashing, particularly the offences arising from\n commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership\n or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family\n disputes where the wrong is basically private or\n personal in nature and the parties have resolved their\n entire dispute. In this category of cases, the High\n Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its\n view, because of the compromise between the\n offender and the victim, the possibility of conviction\n is remote and bleak and continuation of the criminal\n case would put the accused to great oppression and\n prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to\n him by not quashing the criminal case despite full\n\n 21/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n and complete settlement and compromise with the\n victim. In other words, the High Court must consider\n whether it would be unfair or contrary to the interest\n of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or\n continuation of the criminal proceeding would\n tantamount to abuse of process of law despite\n settlement and compromise between the victim and\n the wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of\n justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put\n to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is\n in the affirmative, the High Court shall be well\n within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\n proceeding.”\n\n 31. There is no quarrel over the proposition that the\n High Court will be well within its jurisdiction to quash the\n proceedings on compromise, if the offence is predominantly\n civil in nature, private in nature, completely settled between\n the parties with no claim subsisting and the continuance of the\n proceedings is a bleak prospect for the prosecution and would\n be oppressive on the accused to be continued, even after\n settlement. The power is to be exercised with a great amount\n of prudence and responsibility, to secure the ends of justice.\n\n 32. However, the question regarding the instances of\n various frauds committed by parties concerning banking\n transactions, obtaining loans, and defaulting on and\n subsequently settling them through methods like OTS, with\n the bank, has been addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n India in the cases mentioned above. In some cases, cases were\n quashed, while in others, they were not. But a proper and\n combined reading of all the judgments cited above related to\n this subject shows that the common thread for the conclusion\n reached. It is not the classification or categorisation of the\n particular offence, such as 468, 471 of \nIPC\n, or offences under\n Section 120 B read with 420 of \nIPC\n which is paramount.\n Instead, it is the nature of the allegations that the Court must\n examine. By considering the facts and circumstances of each\n case, one has to determine whether the case involves a purely\n commercial or private transaction between the bank and the\n borrower, or if it has broader implications affecting society or\n the financial system as a whole.\n\n 33. In these cases, the nature of facts and circumstances\n\n 22/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n must be examined. First, the Court must be satisfied that the\n case is primarily commercial or civil in nature and that the\n criminal aspects are not of utmost depravity and seriousness,\n which could have a likely impact on society as a whole or the\n country's financial system. The second step involves assessing\n whether the case has been fully settled and whether the Bank\n has any remaining claims. If the case has reached a complete\n and final settlement and the bank has no pending claims, then\n the Court moves to the third step to evaluate whether\n continuing the prosecution is prudent and likely to succeed in\n prosecuting the accused. Additionally, the Court must consider\n whether continuing the proceedings would be unfair,\n oppressive, or constitute an abuse of the legal process,\n considering the nature of the settlement or compromise, the\n circumstances of the alleged default, efforts made by the\n accused, the time elapsed, and the stage at which quashing is\n requested. In the interest of justice, the Court may, in fit cases,\n decide to quash the proceedings. In appropriate cases, costs\n can also be imposed.”\n\n 4.1. Based on the above, examining the facts of the present case, it is\n\n clear that the only offense alleged is under \nSection 420\n of the Indian Penal\n\n Code. Although the Bank has no serious objection, it has not explicitly agreed\n\n to join the petitioner in filing an application for compounding before the\n\n appropriate forum.\n\n 4.2. The main allegation against the petitioner is that, immediately after\n\n receiving the loan, the funds were diverted from the original purposes stated in\n\n the loan application, such as purchasing tools and equipment. The entire loan\n\n amount was initially used to create Fixed Deposits and was later reallocated\n\n 23/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n for other purposes, including providing margin money for bank guarantees and\n\n transferring funds to other institutions related to the petitioner, including those\n\n associated with the marine college business. Therefore, the core allegation is\n\n that the petitioner acted dishonestly by misrepresenting the purpose for which\n\n the loan was obtained. Although the funds were meant for his other business\n\n ventures, a different purpose was declared in the loan application.\n\n 4.3. When the loan amount was disbursed in April 2016, July 2016,\n\n October 2016, and the final transfer of Rs. 1 Crore was sanctioned in March\n\n 2017, it is evident that in the very next quarter, on 29.06.2017, the account\n\n was classified as NPA. The original loan was obtained from the erstwhile\n\n Syndicate Bank, which later merged with Canara Bank. The statement of\n\n L.W.7 – Shri Ar u n Ras a p p a n , regarding the pending disbursement and\n\n utilization of the bank accounts, reads as follows:-\n\n “On being asked how many Bank Loan accounts have opened in\n the name of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited, I state that after\n sanction of various credit facilities to M/s Air Carnival Private\n Limited, I have conveyed the sanction details to company and\n after execution of loan documents, loan accounts have opened\n in the name of M/s Air Carnival Private Limited viz.

There is also an additional allegation that when the balance sheet of\n\n the original concern, viz., M/s Jet Carnival, showed a net worth of Rs.5.37\n\n Crores, there was a sudden increase of Rs.11.85 Crores in just one month and\n\n seven days, to reflect a higher valuation of Rs.11.85 Crores for the purpose of\n\n portraying increased capital as if infused by the firm. A further reading of the\n\n FIR shows that the company attempted to artificially boost its net worth to\n\n become eligible for a larger loan amount, and later failed to follow the original\n\n business plan by using the loan proceeds for purposes other than those\n\n specified. However, from the testimonies of the various listed witnesses, it\n\n appears that these actions were not done without the knowledge of the relevant\n\n officials. One of the witnesses, viz., Anb u m a n i , was even penalized with a\n\n minor penalty of a one-stage reduction in the pay scale for six months, without\n\n cumulative effect, which did not adversely affect his pension.\n\n 4.6. A review of the loan sanction letters shows that the first sanction\n\n letter, issued for a term loan of Rs.4.7 Crores, states the purpose is to cover\n\n working capital needs. The second sanction letter, dated 04.06.2016, mentions\n\n 27/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n that the loan was approved for purchasing tools and equipment, setting up a\n\n corporate office, acquiring computers, printers, furniture, and carrying out\n\n interior work on leased premises. Furthermore, 30% of the approved amount\n\n had to be deposited as margin money.\n\n 4.7. Firstly, it can be seen that the allegation is the diversion of funds\n\n for a different purpose, which would be a fraud within the meaning of the\n\n circular of the Reserve Bank of India. However, per se, it would not amount to\n\n an offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC. The transactions become an offence\n\n once there is a default. Therefore, only if the petitioner does not pay the\n\n amount due with respect to the specific installments, can it be said that the\n\n ingredients of the offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC, i.e., causing loss to the\n\n bank, are established.\n\n 4.8. Although the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the\n\n entire loan amount was secured, once the purpose of the loan is dishonestly\n\n misrepresented and the amount remains unpaid on the stipulated dates, a prima\n\n facie offence under \nSection 420\n of the IPC is established. Furthermore, the\n\n factors pleaded by the petitioner would need consideration if a determination\n\n is to be made regarding the absence of any intent to cheat the bank. Therefore,\n\n 28/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n at this stage, it cannot be said that no offence under \nSection 420\n of the IPC is\n\n made out.\n\n 4.9. On the other hand, as late as March 2017, the last transaction of\n\n Rs.1 Crore of overdraft facility was sanctioned, and immediately thereafter, in\n\n June 2017, the account was classified as NPA and taken into account.\n\n Although the OTS proposal by the bank states that the settlement is not for the\n\n ongoing criminal case, it is important to note that the standard clause is\n\n included in all cases, as the bank cannot withdraw or compound because non-\n\n compoundable offences are typically involved. Even in this case, offences\n\n under Section 120(B) and also the offence under \nSection 13(2)\n read with\n\n 13(1)(d) were initially alleged against the bank officials, but these charges\n\n were later dropped, leaving only the offence under \nSection 420\n IPC against the\n\n petitioner.\n\n 4.10. Therefore, after careful consideration and review of the facts, the\n\n position tilts in favor of the petitioner, indicating that the entire episode is\n\n primarily commercial or civil in nature and does not impact society at large.\n\n The civil dispute between the petitioner and the Bank has been amicably\n\n 29/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n resolved, with the bank explicitly stating that no amount is due. Based on the\n\n final report and collected materials, although there is evidence of siphoning\n\n funds, the question of whether the intent to cheat the bank was present from\n\n the outset would be difficult for the prosecution to prove to secure a\n\n conviction, especially if proper security was provided. More importantly, the\n\n diversion of funds initially was not to any external element but to the fixed\n\n deposit accounts with the bank itself. The period during which the loan was\n\n sanctioned, the fact that the petitioner’s venture quickly failed resulting in the\n\n entire loan being classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), and the\n\n settlement reached on 02.03.2022 all suggest there was no deliberate delay or\n\n mala fide intent by the petitioner to prolong the matter. Rather, the petitioner\n\n sincerely attempted to settle the dispute amicably and swiftly with the bank.\n\n Therefore, considering the full efforts toward settlement and compromise,\n\n continuing the prosecution may be deemed oppressive and unjust to the\n\n petitioner. Moreover, as per the dictum of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,\n\n the entire basis of the complaint leading to the prosecution is solely due to the\n\n petitioner’s default in amounts and causing the account to become an NPA.\n\n \nThus, the costs for prosecution and court fees should be imposed as per the\n\n ruling in \nKothari Polymers Limited and Others Vs. CBI3\n.\n\n 3 (2022) SCC Online SC 2078\n\n 30/33\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:13 pm )\n\n\f Crl.O.P.No.9815 of 2024\n\n 4.11. The total loan amount in this case is Rs.13.65 Crores, and I am of\n\n the view that a cost of Rs.8 Lakhs should be imposed on the petitioner. Of this\n\n a sum of Rs.4 Lakhs should be paid to the 1st respondent / Central Bureau of\n\n Investigation towards prosecution expenses, and another Rs.4 Lakhs should be\n\n deposited to the credit of the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre,\n\n High Court of Madras, Chennai – 104.
