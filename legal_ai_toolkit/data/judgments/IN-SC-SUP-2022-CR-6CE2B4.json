The present appeal is directed against the judgment and order\n\ndated 31.01.2022 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “High Court”) in Criminal Appeal No. 166 of\n\n2021 filed by the Appellants herein seeking to set aside the order of\n\nconviction passed by the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chennai\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “Trial Court”) in S.C No. 209 of 2016 under\n\nSections 498A\nand\nof the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to\n\nas “\nIPC\n”). The Appellants were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for\n\na period of 3 years with a fine of Rs. 5,000/- each, in default of which to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nPOOJA SHARMA\n\nDate: 2022.10.12\n\n16:31:12 IST\n\nReason:\n\nundergo simple imprisonment for a period of one month under\nSection\n498A\nIPC and to undergo imprisonment for a period of 7 years with a\n\nfine of Rs. 25,000/- each in default of which to undergo simple\n\nimprisonment for a period of 3 months under\nSection 306\nIPC. By\n\nimpugned judgment, the High Court upheld the conviction of the\n\nAppellants for the offence under\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC.\n\n2. Briefly, the facts relevant for the purpose of this appeal are as\n\nfollows:\n\n2.1 The marriage between Appellant No. 1 and Dr. M. Amali Victoria\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “deceased”) was solemnised on 08.09.2005\n\nand a male child was born out of wedlock in the year 2007. On the\n\nprofessional front, both parties are doctors. Appellant No. 1 was\n\ninformed on 05.11.2014 that the deceased had collapsed in the\n\nbathroom of their home and was non-responsive. Immediately, an\n\nambulance was called by the father of Appellant No. 1. On reaching the\n\nsite of the incident, Appellant No. 1 found the deceased having no pulse.\n\nDespite intervention from the neighbors of Appellant No. 1 who were\n\ndoctors, the deceased could not be resuscitated and passed away on\n\n05.11.2014. Post mortem of the body was conducted on 06.11.2014 and\n\nthe cause of death was asphyxia due to external compression of the\n\nneck.\n2.2 On 06.11.2014, The Respondent Police registered FIR No. 1865 of\n\n2015 at Police Station K2, Ayanavaram, District Kilpauk, Chennai based\n\non the statement of Appellant No. 1 owing to the unnatural death of the\n\ndeceased under\nSection 174\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “\nCr.P.C\n”).\n\n2.3 After 3 weeks of the death of the deceased, PW-1(the mother of\n\nthe deceased) lodged a complaint against the Appellant No.1, Appellant\n\nNo. 2(mother-in-law), and the father-in-law of the deceased for the\n\noffences punishable under\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC. Thereafter, the\n\nFIR was converted from\nSection 174\nCr.P.C to\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC.\n\n2.4 It was the case of the prosecution that the marriage of the\n\ndeceased with Appellant No. 1 was solemnised in the year 2005 and\n\nsince the deceased was not having a child for 1.5 years, the appellants\n\nabused her and compelled her to participate in the Pooja and on the\n\nrefusal of the same, she was threatened by the appellants that she\n\nwould die. Subsequently, the deceased gave birth to a male child\n\nnamed Rosando by caesarean in the year 2007. Further, the Appellant\n\nNo. 1 caused immense mental torture to the deceased by compelling\n\nher to have another child in spite of the fact that the deceased had a\nmiscarriage with her second pregnancy. The deceased was made to do\n\nall the domestic household work and was subjected to continuous\n\ncruelty at the hands of the appellants. Due to the same reason, the\n\ndeceased was driven to commit suicide on 05.11.2014.\n\n3. Thereafter, on completion of the investigation, charge sheet was\n\nfiled and cognizance was taken. Since the offences are triable by the\n\nCourt of Session, the said case being SC No. 209 of 2016 was\n\ncommitted to Mahila Court, Chennai for trial.\n\n4. The Trial Court framed charges against the appellants for the\n\noffences under\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC. The appellants pleaded not\n\nguilty and therefore they came to be tried for the aforesaid offence.\n\n5. In order to substantiate the case, the prosecution examined 15\n\nwitnesses. From side of the defence, no witnesses were examined. The\n\nstatement of the appellants was also recorded under Section 313 of\n\nCr.P.C.\n\n6. The Trial Court, after analysing the statement made by the\n\nprosecution witness and evidence of the defence, vide judgment and\n\norder dated 26.03.2021 convicted the Appellants i.e., the husband and\n\nmother-in-law of the deceased for the offences under\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC and were sentenced as stated herein above. The Trial Court\n\nacquitted the father-in-law of the deceased of all the charges.\n\n7. Challenging the judgment and order passed by the Trial Court, the\n\nAppellants filed Criminal Appeal No. 166 of 2021 before the High Court.\n\nThe same was dismissed with the observation that the Appellants have\n\ncommitted the offence under\nSections 498A\nand\nIPC and the Trial\n\nCourt rightly appreciated the evidence and convicted the appellants\n\nherein. The Respondent police were directed to send the appellants to\n\nundergo the remaining period of sentence. Being aggrieved by the High\n\nCourt order, the appellants have preferred the present appeal.\n\n8. We have heard Mr. Kapil Sibal, Learned Senior Advocate\n\nappearing on behalf of the appellants and Mr. P.V. Yogeswaran,\n\nLearned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents.\n\nContentions on behalf of the Appellants:\n\n9. Mr. Kapil Sibal, Learned Senior Advocate submitted that the\n\nallegations of cruelty have been made for the first time in the complaint\n\nmade by the mother of the deceased and there is not even a whisper of\n\nthese allegations in over 9 years of marriage by the deceased or her\n\nfamily. On the contrary, the relations between the Appellants and his\n\nfamily, and the deceased and her family were extremely cordial.\n10. It was vehemently submitted that the deceased was suffering from\n\nbipolar disorder and this fact was not disclosed to the petitioner at the\n\ntime of marriage. In spite of the non-disclosure of the same, Appellant\n\nNo. 1 took good care of the deceased and it cannot be alleged that the\n\ndeceased committed suicide due to abetment by the Appellants.\n\n11. It was further submitted that the complaint has been made\n\nbelatedly with an ulterior motive which is also reflected in/from the initial\n\nstatements of family members of the deceased made soon after her\n\ndeath.\n\n12. It was next submitted that there were no signs of animosity\n\nbetween the families when their statements were being recorded\n\nimmediately after the death of the deceased. However, one of the sisters\n\nof the deceased asked for the custody of Appellant No.1’s son (rights\n\nover the property) and on refusal, the complaints started.\n\n13. It was further submitted that the courts below completely\n\ndisregarded the testimony of PW-9 who was the medical professional,\n\nwho treated the deceased on 04.11.2014 ie., one day before her death.\n\nThe summary recorded by PW-9 clearly records the history of\n\ndepressive illness in the past, suicidal attempts, and suicidal ideas.\n14. It was also submitted that the courts below have proceeded with\n\nconvicting the appellants solely on the basis of the testimony of PW-1 to\n\nPW-3 alleging continuous harassment and mental cruelty by the\n\nappellants.\n\n15. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in\nAmalendu\n\nPal Vs. State of West Bengal1\n,\nRajesh Vs. State of Haryana2\n,\n\nGurcharan Singh Vs. State of Punjab\n3,\nUde Singh & Ors. Vs. State\n\nof Haryana4\n.\n\nContentions on behalf of the Respondents:\n\n16. Mr. P.V. Yogeswaran, Learned Counsel appearing for the\n\nRespondents submitted that the evidence of PW-1 to PW-3 has clearly\n\nestablished that after marriage, all the accused persons demanded more\n\ndowry and also stated how the deceased was abused and humiliated for\n\nnot conceiving and compelled her consume cow urine in the name of\n\n‘Pooja’.\n\n17. It was further submitted that the Trial Court as well the High Court\n\nhas weighed all relevant factors, including the nature of the charge, the\n\n1 (2010) 1 SCC 707\n2 (2020) 15 SCC 359\n3 (2020) 10 SCC 200\n4 (2019) 17 SCC 301\ngravity of the offence and penalty, and the nature of evidence while\n\nconvicting the Appellants under\nSections 306\nand\n498A\nIPC.\n\n18. It was also submitted that PW-1 to PW-3 have consistently stated\n\nabout the nature of harassment and incident which instigated the victim\n\nto commit suicide leaving her only child.\n\n19. It was next vehemently submitted that there is clear evidence to\n\nshow that after the abortion of second pregnancy in 2014, the abuse,\n\nharassment, and instigation by the accused persons increased many\n\nfolds.\n\n20. We have carefully considered the rival contentions of the learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the parties and perused the entire records.\n\n21. The genesis of the present appeal originates from the impugned\n\norder pronounced by the High Court whereby the High Court upheld the\n\nconviction of the Appellants under\nSections 306\nand\n498A\nof IPC. Taking\n\nthat into account, it is necessary to advert to the essential ingredients of\n\nSection 306\nIPC.\n22.\nSection 306\nof IPC reads as under: -\n\n“306. Abetment of suicide: - If any person commits\nsuicide, whoever abets the commission of such\nsuicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten years,\nand shall also be liable to fine.”\n\n23. Abetment is defined under\nSection 107\nof IPC which reads as\nunder:-\n\n“107. Abetment of a thing:- A person abets the\ndoing of a thing, who -\n\nFirst- Instigates any person to do that thing; or\n\nSecondly- Engages with one or more other person or\npersons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if\nan act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of\nthat conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing;\nor\n\nThirdly- Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal\nomission, the doing of that thing.\n\nExplanation 1- A person who by wilful\nmisrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a\nmaterial fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily\ncauses or procures, or attempts to cause or procure,\na thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that\nthing.\n\nExplanation 2- Whoever, either prior to or at the time\nof the commission of an act, does anything in order to\nfacilitate the commission of that act, and thereby\nfacilitate the commission thereof, is said to aid the\ndoing of that act.”\n24. While analyzing the provisions of\nSection 306\nIPC along with the\n\ndefinition of abetment under\nSection 107\nIPC, a two-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt in\nGeo Varghese Vs. State of Rajasthan and Another\n5 has\n\nobserved as under:-\n\n“13. In our country, while suicide in itself is not an\noffence as a person committing suicide goes beyond\nthe reach of law but an attempt to suicide is considered\nto be an offence under\nSection 309\nIPC. The abetment\nof suicide by anybody is also an offence under\nSection\nIPC. It would be relevant to set out\nSection 306\nof\nthe IPC which reads as under :-\n\n“306. Abetment of suicide. —If any person\ncommits suicide, whoever abets the\ncommission of such suicide, shall be\npunished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to\nten years, and shall also be liable to fine.”\n\n14. Though, the\nIPC\ndoes not define the word\n‘Suicide’ but the ordinary dictionary meaning of\nsuicide is ‘self-killing’. The word is derived from a\nmodern latin word ‘suicidium’ , ‘sui’ means\n‘oneself’ and ‘cidium’ means ‘killing’. Thus, the word\nsuicide implies an act of ‘self-killing’. In other words,\nact of death must be committed by the deceased\nhimself, irrespective of the means adopted by him in\nachieving the object of killing himself.\n\n15.\nSection 306\nof IPC makes abetment of suicide a\ncriminal offence and prescribes punishment for the\nsame.\n\n16. The ordinary dictionary meaning of the word\n‘instigate’ is to bring about or initiate, incite someone to\ndo something. This Court in the case of Ramesh\n\n5 2021 SCC OnLine SC 873\nKumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh1 has defined the\nword ‘instigate’ as under :-\n\n“Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke,\nincite or encourage to do an act.”\n\n17. The scope and ambit of Section 107 IPC and its co-\n\nrelation with\nSection 306\nIPC has been discussed\nrepeatedly by this Court.\nIn the case of\nS.S.Cheena Vs.\nVijay Kumar Mahajan and Anr6\n, it was observed as\nunder:-\n\n“Abetment involves a mental process of\ninstigating a person or intentionally aiding a\nperson in doing of a thing. Without a positive\nact on the part of the accused to instigate or aid\nin committing suicide, conviction cannot be\nsustained. The intention of the legislature and\nthe ratio of the cases decided by the Supreme\nCourt is clear that in order to convict a person\nunder\nSection 306\nIPC there has to be a clear\nmens rea to commit the offence. It also requires\nan active act or direct act which led the\ndeceased to commit suicide seeing no option\nand that act must have been intended to push\nthe deceased into such a position that he\ncommitted suicide.”\n\n25. The ingredients of\nSection 306\nIPC have been extensively laid out\n\nin\nM. Arjunan Vs. State\n, represented by its Inspector of Police 7 which\n\nare as under: -\n\n“The essential ingredients of the offence under\nSection\nI.P.C. are: (i) the abetment; (ii) the intention of the\naccused to aid or instigate or abet the deceased to\ncommit suicide. The act of the accused, however,\ninsulting the deceased by using abusive language will\nnot, by itself, constitute the abetment of suicide. There\n\n6 (2010) 12 SCC 190\n7 (2019) 3 SCC 315\nshould be evidence capable of suggesting that the\naccused intended by such act to instigate the\ndeceased to commit suicide. Unless the ingredients of\ninstigation/abetment to commit suicide are satisfied,\naccused cannot be convicted under\nSection 306\n\nI.P.C.”\n\n26. In order to convict an accused under\nSection 306\nIPC, the state of\n\nmind to commit a particular crime must be visible with regard to\n\ndetermining the culpability. With regard to the same, a two-judge bench\n\nof this Court in\nUde Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana\n8 observed as\n\nunder:-\n\n“16. In cases of alleged abetment of suicide, there\nmust be a proof of direct or indirect act/s of incitement\nto the commission of suicide. It could hardly be\ndisputed that the question of cause of a suicide,\nparticularly in the context of an offence of abetment of\nsuicide, remains a vexed one, involving multifaceted\nand complex attributes of human behavior and\nresponses/reactions. In the case of accusation for\nabetment of suicide, the Court would be looking for\ncogent and convincing proof of the act/s of incitement\nto the commission of suicide. In the case of suicide,\nmere allegation of harassment of the deceased by\nanother person would not suffice unless there be such\naction on the part of the accused which compels the\nperson to commit suicide; and such an offending\naction ought to be proximate to the time of occurrence.\nWhether a person has abetted in the commission of\nsuicide by another or not, could only be gathered from\nthe facts and circumstances of each case.\n16.1. For the purpose of finding out if a person has\nabetted commission of suicide by another; the\nconsideration would be if the accused is guilty of the\nact of instigation of the act of suicide. As explained\n\n8 (2019) 17 SCC 301\nand reiterated by this Court in the decisions above-\n\nreferred, instigation means to goad, urge forward,\nprovoke, incite or encourage to do an act. If the\npersons who committed suicide had been\nhypersensitive and the action of accused is otherwise\nnot ordinarily expected to induce a similarly\ncircumstanced person to commit suicide, it may not be\nsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide.\nBut, on the other hand, if the accused by his acts and\nby his continuous course of conduct creates a\nsituation which leads the deceased perceiving no\nother option except to commit suicide, the case may\nfall within the four-corners of\nSection 306\nIPC. If the\naccused plays an active role in tarnishing the self-\nesteem and self-respect of the victim, which eventually\ndraws the victim to commit suicide, the accused may\nbe held guilty of abetment of suicide. The question of\nmens rea on the part of the accused in such cases\nwould be examined with reference to the actual acts\nand deeds of the accused and if the acts and deeds\nare only of such nature where the accused intended\nnothing more than harassment or snap show of anger,\na particular case may fall short of the offence of\nabetment of suicide. However, if the accused kept on\nirritating or annoying the deceased by words or deeds\nuntil the deceased reacted or was provoked, a\nparticular case may be that of abetment of suicide.\nSuch being the matter of delicate analysis of human\nbehaviour, each case is required to be examined on its\nown facts, while taking note of all the surrounding\nfactors having bearing on the actions and psyche of\nthe accused and the deceased.”\n\n27. In the backdrop of the above discussion, we may now advert to the\n\nfacts of the present case to test whether the conviction of the Appellants\n\nfor the offence under\nSections 306\nand\n498A\nIPC is sustainable or not.\n28. The marriage of Appellant No. 1 and the deceased was\n\nsolemnised in the year 2005 and a male child named “Rosando” was\n\nborn out of the wedlock in the year 2007. It is pertinent to mention that\n\nboth, Appellant No. 1 and the deceased are reputed doctors by\n\nprofession working in the State of Tamil Nadu. There has been no\n\nanimosity between the families of Appellant No. 1 and the deceased\n\nthroughout their marriage. Infact, after the marriage, Appellant No. 1\n\ncame to know that the deceased was suffering from bipolar disorder.\n\nSubsequently he also came to know that she had suicidal tendencies\n\nright from her student days and had undergone treatment under a\n\npsychiatrist at Thirunelveli, Tamil Nadu.\n\n29. At this stage, it may be relevant to refer to the statement made by\n\nAppellant No. 1 under\nSection 313\nCr.P.C which is as under:\n\n“My wife had mental illness right from her young age.\nShe had undergone treatment several times as an in-\npatient even while she was studying. She had even\nattempted suicide several times. They had got her\nmarried suppressing the above facts. I became aware\nof these facts only after the marriage when I\nconfronted my mother-in-law and my wife’s sister\nregarding the above, my mother-in-law had left for\nAmerica. It was I who had treated my wife for 9 years\nthereafter. I had managed to ensure that the effects of\nthe disease are contained to the minimum possible.\nShe continuously had Bipolar Disorder, Depression,\nPhobias, Hallucination and Suicidal tendency. She had\nbeen taking several medicines continuously for these.”\nThe fact stands corroborated by the summary of treatment report dated\n\n04.11.14 by Dr. Shalini, Consultant Psychiatrist, PW-9 which is\n\nreproduced below:-\n\n“Dr. Amali Victoria/32/F MBBS, MD(psy), Asst Prof IMH\nW/o Mr. Mariano Bruno / 36/ M Mch (Neuro) Surgeon\nMx 7 years A/NC/N/ 1 Son 7/M\n\n Couple present together\n\n Wife C/o sadness for past 1 month, after being posted in female\nward @ IMH\n\no Feels tired, not interested in working\no Feels demoralized, incapacitated\no Poor sleep\n\n She had felt well until 6 weeks, suddenly turned more and more\ndesparate.\n\n No H/o hypothyroidism\n\n H/o similar depressive illness in the past (+)\n\no H/o episode during MBBS, had attempted suicide, had\ntaken treatment with a psychiatrist at Thirunelvelli,\nadmitted in ICU, TMC.\n\no 2nd episode post partum\no 3rd episode present\n\n C/o suicidal ideas past two days – hence husband has brought\nher for consultation today\n\n Client’s husband wants to go in for 2 nd child, where as amali\nfears that she may not be able to cope up.

She feels she will not be able to\ntake care of her son or other future kids on her own.\n Husband says he had requested for a second opinion because\nhe feels she is getting very quiet and inactive at home. She had\npreviously consulted her psychiatrist colleague at IMH also. But\nhusband wants a second opinion as she has been talking of\ncommitting suicide for the past 2 days.\n\n Amali Counselled\nAdvised free T3, TSH\nRx\nCap.

Within few weeks of marriage, the Appellant No. 1 wrote an email\n\nto the deceased’s mother and sister seeking their help in order to take\n\ncare of the deceased but the deceased’s mother refused to help and she\n\nleft for United States. Subsequently, with the help of Appellant No. 1, the\n\nhealth condition of the deceased improved and she finished her post-\n\ngraduation in 2013 with a gold medal and subsequently, started working\n\nin the year 2014. The relationship between the families were cordial and\n\nthe deceased was very affectionate towards the Appellant’s family and\n\nthere are no evidence of cruelty or harassment meted out to her by the\n\nAppellants.\n\n31. In the year 2014, the deceased suffered a miscarriage, due to\n\nwhich she started showing signs of depression and further took\ntreatment on 04.11.2014 from Dr. Shalini ie, PW-9, who prescribed\n\ncertain medications. However, the deceased passed away on\n\n05.11.2014 after she was found unconscious in the bathroom.\n\n32. With respect to bipolar disorder with which the deceased was\n\nsuffering, it refers to a disorder associated with episodes of mood swings\n\nranging from depressive lows to manic highs. Some of the symptoms of\n\nbipolar disorder are as follows:\n\n Feeling sad, hopeless or irritable most of the time\n Lack of energy\n Difficulty in concentrating and remembering things\n Loss of interest in everyday activities\n Feelings of emptiness or worthlessness\n\nIndeed, each suicide is a personal tragedy that prematurely takes the life\n\nof an individual and has a continuing ripple effect, dramatically affecting\n\nthe lives of families, friends and communities. However, the court of law\n\nwhile adjudicating is not to be guided by emotions of sentiments but the\n\ndictum is required to be based on analysis of facts and evidence on\n\nrecord.\n\n33. Coming to the case at hand, FIR was lodged by Appellant No.1\n\ndue to the unnatural death of the deceased, soon thereafter, one of the\n\nsisters of the deceased asked for the custody of the son of Appellant\n\nNo.1 and on refusal of the same, the mother of the deceased gave an\noral statement after 3 weeks of the death of the deceased alleging that\n\nthe Appellants caused the death of the deceased and that she was\n\nsubject to constant harassment at the hands of the Appellants due to\n\ninsufficient dowry and the Appellants constantly abused the deceased for\n\nnot conceiving. It is thereafter, the FIR was converted from\nSection 174\n\nCr.P.C to\nSection 306\nIPC. Charges were framed and after completion of\n\ntrial, the Trial Court convicted the Appellants under\nSections 306\nand\n\n498A\nIPC. On Appeal, the High Court upheld the same. The operative\n\nportion of the judgment reads as under: -\n\n“16. Two things have to be proved by the prosecution\nin order to sustain the appellants' conviction for the\noffences under\nSection 498(A)\nand\nIPC, as to\nwhether, the death of the deceased is unnatural and\nas to whether the deceased committed suicide due to\nharassment, inducement and abetment of the\nappellants. In this case, as already stated, as per\nthe Medical evidence, it is clear that the victim\ndied unnaturally and the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3\nproved that the appellants made harassment on\nthe victim and caused mental and physical cruelty.\nDue to cruelty, the deceased has taken the\nextreme step to end her life.\n\n18. In cases of this nature, no independent witness\ncan be expected, because in India, the woman are\neven well qualified persons, considering their family\nreputation, they may not express certain things to any\nthird person or stranger and they can only say either to\ntheir mother or sister or very close friend or well-\n\nwishers. In this case, P.W.1 is the mother of the\ndeceased and P.W.2 is the elder sister of the\ndeceased. There are no medical records produced on\nthe side of the appellants to show that the deceased\nwas mentally disordered person or she is having\ntendency of committing suicide. However, the\nevidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3 and P.W.10, would clearly\nshow that the deceased committed suicide due to the\ncontinuous harassment and the mental cruelty made\nby the appellants. Hence, the evidence of P.W.1 to\nP.W.3 are reliable and trustworthy, which inspires the\nconfidence of this Court to convict the appellants.\nTestimony of interested witness cannot be per se\ndiscarded and the Court has to adopt careful approach\nand analyse evidence to find out the cogency and\ncredibility. This Court does not find out any reason to\ndisbelieve the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3 and\nevidence of P.W.2 was corroborated by the evidence\nof P.W.10.\n\n20. A careful reading of the evidence of P.W.1 to P.W.3\nand also the evidence of the Doctor who conducted\npost-mortem proved that the victim was subjected to\nharassment and cruelty made by the appellants. She\nis well educated and working as a Psychiatrist in the\nGovernment Mental Hospital, Kilpauk, she ended her\nlife by way of hanging. Therefore, this Court finds that\nthe appellants have committed the offence under\n\nSections 498(A)\nand\nIPC and the learned trial\nJudge rightly appreciated the evidence and convicted\nthe appellants and therefore, there is no merit in this\ncase and the appeal is liable to be dismissed.”\n\n34. A bare perusal of the impugned judgment indicates that the High\n\nCourt erred in recording the finding that there is sufficient evidence for\n\nconvicting the appellants under\nSection 306\nIPC losing sight of the fact\n\nthat there exists no evidence on record indicating that the deceased was\n\nmeted out with harassment by the appellants just before her death. It is\n\nwell-settled that not only there has to be evidence of continuous\n\nharassment, but there should be cogent evidence to establish a positive\naction by the accused which should more or less be proximate to the\n\ntime of occurrence, which action can said to have led or compelled the\n\nperson to commit suicide.\n\n35. In case at hand, not only the said positive action in close proximity\n\nto the time of suicide is absent but also there is no evidence for any\n\ncontinuous physical or mental torture meted out to the deceased by the\n\nappellants. On the contrary, appellant no. 1 himself took the deceased to\n\nconsult a psychiatrist just a day prior to this incident obviously with the\n\nintention to make her feel better. The said act can by no stretch of\n\nimagination be said to be any such act which may lead the deceased to\n\ncommit suicide. Further, the allegations made by PW-1 to PW-3 in their\n\nstatement with respect to continuous harassment and torture of the\n\ndeceased by the appellants just after the marriage is not worthy of being\n\nrelied upon and has to be taken with a pinch of salt on account of fact\n\nthat throughout their 9 years of marriage, there has never been any\n\ncomplaint or a whisper in this regard either by the deceased or her family\n\nmembers who appeared as prosecution witnesses. Even the deceased\n\nherself who was a qualified doctor never made any complaint in this\n\nregard. It is really hard to believe that a well-educated and self-reliant\n\nlady would take such things lying down for a substantially long period of\n\n9 years.\n36. To convict a person under\nSection 306\nIPC, there has to be clear\n\nmens rea to commit offence. It also requires an active act or direct act\n\nwhich leads deceased to commit suicide finding no other option and the\n\nact must be such reflecting intention of the accused to push deceased\n\ninto such a position that he commits suicide. The prosecution has to\n\nestablish beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased committed suicide\n\nand Appellant No. 1 abetted the commission of suicide of the deceased.\n\nIn the present case, both the elements are absent.\n\n37. Now, so far as conviction under\nSection 498A\nIPC is concerned,\n\nexcept the statement of the prosecution witnesses PW-1 to PW-3\n\nrecorded after the incident, there is no other evidence to establish the\n\nallegation of any demand of dowry or ill treatment meted out to the\n\ndeceased during her marriage. The fact that there were cordial relations\n\nbetween the families of Appellant No. 1 and the deceased is not\n\ndisputed. The deceased committed suicide on 05.11.2014 and the\n\ncomplaint against the appellants were filed on 24.11.2014 i.e., 3 weeks\n\nafter the death of the deceased.\n\n38. This Court has time and again reiterated that before convicting an\n\naccused under\nSection 306\nIPC, the Court must scrupulously examine\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the case and also assess the evidence\nadduced before it in order to find out whether cruelty and harassment\n\nmeted out to the victim had left the victim with no other alternative but to\n\nput an end to her life. It is also to be borne in mind that in cases of\n\nalleged abetment of suicide, there must be proof of direct or indirect acts\n\nof incitement to the commission of suicide. Merely on the allegation of\n\nharassment without their being any positive action proximate to the time\n\nof occurrence on the part of the accused which led or compelled the\n\nperson to commit suicide, conviction in terms of\nSection 306\nIPC is not\n\nsustainable.\n\n39. Prosecution in order to prove the guilt of accused/appellants\n\nproduced the following witnesses:\n\n Mother of the deceased – PW-1\n Sister of the deceased – PW-2\n Brother of the deceased - PW-3\n Carpenter who broke open the bathroom door - PW-4\n servant maid working in the house - PW-5\n AC mechanic who accompanied the carpenter - PW-6\n Colleague of the deceased - PW-7\n Colleague of the deceased - PW-8\n Doctor who gave the treatment to the deceased on\n04.11.2014 - PW-9\n Doctor who conducted autopsy on the dead body -\nPW-10\n Doctor who declared the deceased as brought dead\non 05.11.2014 - PW-11\n Doctor who treated the deceased on abortion of the\nsecond child - PW-12\n Auto driver - PW-13\n Sub-Inspector of Police - PW-14\n Inspector of Police who investigated the case – PW-15\n40. PW-1 to PW-3 are interested witnesses, still, PW-3 categorically\n\nstated that “the marriage between my sister Dr. Amali Victoria and Dr.\n\nBruno was a happy marriage”. Thus there exists material contradictions\n\nnot only in his own statements and also the statement of other two\n\nwitnesses.\n\n41. PW-9, Dr. Shalini is the Psychiatrist who had given treatment to the\n\ndeceased on 04.11.2014. she had deposed that the deceased\n\nexpressed her disinterest in duty, complained of lack of sleep and not\n\nfeeling hungry and also had no interest over anything. Further, PW-9\n\nstated that these were the symptoms of depression. PW-9 in her\n\nsummary of treatment report dated 04.11.2014 stated that the deceased\n\nstated cause of sadness for the past 1 month was due to her posting at\n\nthe female ward @ IMH and she feels tired, is not interested in working,\n\npoor sleep pattern to name a few. Furthermore, it is pertinent to mention\n\nthat it was also noted in treatment summary by PW-9 that the deceased\n\nhad similar depressive illness in the past i.e., 1 st episode during MBBS\n\ncollege days, had attempted suicide, 2 nd episode post-partum and\n\npresent is the third episode. The deceased had suicidal ideas before\n\ngoing for the consultation with the psychiatrist on 04.11.2014 and the\n\nsame is evident from the summary of treatment. However, the evidence\n\nof PW-9 i.e., the psychiatrist has not been considered by the Courts\nbelow and conviction of the appellants were solely based on the oral\n\nevidence of PW-1 to PW-3.\n\n42. It is well settled that the Courts ought to be extremely careful in\n\nassessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the evidence\n\nadduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether the cruelty meted\n\nout to the victim had in fact induced her to end the life by committing\n\nsuicide. Reference may be made to the judgment of a three-Judge\n\nBench of this Court in\nRamesh Kumar Vs. State of Chhattisgarh\n9,\n\nwherein this Court set-aside the conviction of the accused for the offence\n\nunder\nSection 306\nIPC as ingredients of\nSection 306\nIPC were not\n\nsatisfactorily proved. It was observed as under :-\n\n“20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke,\nincite or encourage to do \"an act\". To satisfy the\nrequirement of instigation though it is not necessary\nthat actual words must be used to that effect or what\nconstitutes instigation must necessarily and\nspecifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a\nreasonable certainty to incite the consequence must\nbe capable of being spelt out. The present one is not\na case where the accused had by his acts or\nomission or by a continued course of conduct\ncreated such circumstances that the deceased\nwas left with no other option except to commit\nsuicide in which case an instigation may have\nbeen inferred. A word uttered in the fit of anger or\nemotion without intending the consequences to\nactually follow cannot be said to be instigation.\n\n9 (2001) 9 SCC 618\n21.\nIn\nState of West Bengal v. Orilal Jaiswal and\nAnr.10\n, this Court has cautioned that the Court should\nbe extremely careful in assessing the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and the evidence\nadduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether\nthe cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced\nher to end the life by committing suicide. If it\ntranspires to the Court that a victim committing\nsuicide was hypersensitive to ordinary petulance,\ndiscord and differences in domestic life quite\ncommon to the society to which the victim\nbelonged and such petulance, discord and\ndifferences were not expected to induce a\nsimilarly circumstanced individual in a given\nsociety to commit suicide, the conscience of the\nCourt should not be satisfied for basing a finding\nthat the accused charged of abetting the offence\nof suicide should be found guilty.”\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n43. Accordingly, the facts and evidence in the present case which have\n\nnot been squarely analysed by both the Trial Court as well as the High\n\nCourt can be summarised as follows:-\n\n1. The complaint against the appellants was filed after 3\nweeks of the death of the deceased.\n\n2. There is not a shred of evidence with respect to offence\nalleged under\nSection 498A\nof the IPC meted out to the\ndeceased by the Appellants.\n\n3. There has been no marital discord between Appellant No. 1\nand the deceased during their 9 years of married life.\n\n10 (1994) 1 SCC 73\n4. There have been several emails exchanged between\nAppellant No. 1 and sisters of the deceased whereby the\nAppellant No. 1 was showered with praises for taking care\nof the deceased in the best possible manner and credit was\nalso given to his parents for supporting the deceased in her\ncareer. Further, it was the sister of the deceased, who\nherself sent a mail to Appellant No. 1 saying “amali is\nfighting a disorder”\n\n5. The deceased was suffering from bipolar order and also\nhad suicidal ideas from few days before suicide. Further,\nthe deceased was also undergoing treatment for\ndepression as she was showing major symptoms of\ndepression like tiredness, poor sleep pattern, demoralised\nfeeling to name a few. The fact that deceased was suffering\nfrom bipolar disorder was concealed from the Appellant\nfamily during their marriage.\n\n6. The Trial Court as well as the High Court did not take the\nevidence of PW-9, Psychiatrist into consideration while\nconvicting the Appellants under\nSections 306\nand\n498A\nof\nIPC.\n\n7. The conviction of the appellants is solely based on the oral\nevidence of mother and sister of the deceased, who are\ninterested witnesses.\n\n8. The post mortem report does not give the cause of the\ndeath but on 15.12.14, the cause of the death is shown as\nAshpyxia due to external compression.\n44. Having considered the aforesaid facts of the case in juxtaposition\n\nwith the\njudgments\nreferred to above\nand upon appreciation of evidence\n\nof the eyewitnesses and other material adduced by the prosecution, we\n\nare of the view that Trial Court wrongly convicted the Appellants and the\n\nHigh Court was also not justified in upholding the conviction of the\n\nAppellants under\nSections 306\nand\n498A\nIPC.\n\n45. As a result, the impugned judgment dated 31.01.2022 passed by\n\nthe High Court as well as judgment and order of the Trial Court dated\n\n26.03.2021 are unsustainable and deserve to be set aside and are\n\nhereby set aside. The appellants are acquitted of the charges levelled\n\nagainst them.\n\n46. The appeal, accordingly, stands allowed.\n\n...................................J.\n(M. R.
