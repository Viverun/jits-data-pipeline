SIKRI, J.\n\n(For Chief Justice, himself and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.)\n\nIntroduction and Preliminaries:\n\nIt is better to be unique than the best. Because,\nbeing the best makes you the number one, but\nbeing unique makes you the only one.\n\n2) ‘Unique makes you the only one’ is the central message of\n\nAadhaar, which is on the altar facing constitutional challenge in\n\nthese petitions. ‘Aadhaar’ which means, in English, ‘foundation’\n\nor ‘base’, has become the most talked about expression in recent\n\nyears, not only in India but in many other countries and\n\ninternational bodies. A word from Hindi dictionary has assumed\n\nsecondary significance. Today, mention of the word ‘Aadhaar’\n\nwould not lead a listener to the dictionary meaning of this word.\n\nInstead, every person on the very mentioning of this word\n\n‘Aadhaar’ would associate it with the card that is issued to a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 3 of 567\n\nperson from where he/she can be identified. It is described as an\n\n‘Unique Identity’ and the authority which enrols a person and at\n\nwhose behest the Aadhaar Card is issued is known as Unique\n\nIdentification Authority of India (hereinafter referred to as ‘UIDAI’\n\nor ‘Authority’). It is described as unique for various reasons.\n\nUIDAI claims that not only it is a foolproof method of identifying a\n\nperson, it is also an instrument whereby a person can enter into\n\nany transaction without needing any other document in support.\n\nIt has become a symbol of digital economy and has enabled\n\nmultiple avenues for a common man. Aadhaar scheme, which\n\nwas conceptualised in the year 2006 and launched in the year\n\n2009 with the creation of UIDAI, has secured the enrolment of\n\nalmost 1.1 billion people in this country. Its use is spreading like\n\nwildfire, which is the result of robust and aggressive campaigning\n\ndone by the Government, governmental agencies and other such\n\nbodies. In this way it has virtually become a household symbol.\n\nThe Government boasts of multiple benefits of Aadhaar.\n\n3) At the same time, the very scheme of Aadhaar and the\n\narchitecture built thereupon has received scathing criticism from a\n\nsection of the society. According to them, Aadhaar is a serious\n\ninvasion into the right to privacy of persons and it has the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 4 of 567\n\ntendency to lead to a surveillance state where each individual can\n\nbe kept under surveillance by creating his/her life profile and\n\nmovement as well on his/her use of Aadhaar. There has been no\n\nother subject matter in recent past which has evoked the kind of\n\nintensive and heated debate wherein both sides, for and against,\n\nargue so passionately in support of their respective conviction.\n\nThe petitioners in these petitions belong to the latter category\n\nwho apprehend the totalitarian state if Aadhaar project is allowed\n\nto continue. They are demanding scrapping and demolition of the\n\nentire Aadhaar structure which, according to them, is anathema\n\nto the democratic principles and rule of law, which is the bedrock\n\nof the Indian Constitution. The petitioners have challenged the\n\nAadhaar project which took off by way of administrative action in\n\nthe year 2009. Even after Aadhaar got a shield of statutory cover,\n\nchallenge persists as the very enactment known as\nAadhaar\n\n(Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and\n\nServices) Act, 2016\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Aadhaar Act’)\n\nis challenged as constitutionally impermissible. The wide range\n\nof issues involved in this case is evident from the fact that it took\n\nalmost four months for the parties to finish their arguments in\n\nthese cases, and the Court witnessed highly skilled, suave,\n\nbrilliant and intellectual advocacy, with the traces of passions as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 5 of 567\n\nwell.\n\n4) The issue has generated heated public debate as well. Even\n\noutside the Court, there are groups advocating in favour of the\n\nAadhaar scheme and those who are stoutly opposing the same.\n\nInterestingly, it is not only the commoners who belong to either of\n\nthe two groups but intelligentsia is also equally divided. There\n\nhave been number of articles, interviews for discourses in favour\n\nof or against Aadhaar. Those in favour see Aadhaar project as\n\nushering the nation into a regime of good governance, advancing\n\nsocio-economic rights, economic prosperity etc. and in the\n\nprocess they claim that it may make the nation a world leader.\n\nMr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General for India, referred\n\nto the commendations by certain international bodies, including\n\nthe World Bank. We clarify that we have not been influenced by\n\nsuch views expressed either in favour or against Aadhaar. Those\n\nopposing Aadhaar are apprehensive that it may excessively\n\nintrude into the privacy of citizenry and has the tendency to\n\ncreate a totalitarian state, which would impinge upon the\n\ndemocratic and constitutional values. Some such opinions of\n\nvarious persons/bodies were referred to during the arguments.\n\nNotwithstanding the passions, emotions, annoyance, despair,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 6 of 567\n\necstasy, euphoria, coupled with rhetoric, exhibited by both sides\n\nin equal measure during the arguments, this Court while giving its\n\njudgment on the issues involved is required to have a posture of\n\ncalmness coupled with objective examination of the issues on the\n\ntouchstone of the constitutional provisions.\n\n5) Initiative in spearheading the attack on the Aadhaar structure was\n\ntaken by the petitioners, namely, Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.)\n\nand Mr. Pravesh Khanna, by filing Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of\n\n2012. At that time, Aadhaar scheme was not under legislative\n\numbrella. In the writ petition the scheme has primarily been\n\nchallenged on the ground that it violates fundamental rights of the\n\ninnumerable citizens of India, namely, right to privacy falling\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India. Few others joined\n\nthe race by filing connected petitions. Series of orders were\n\npassed in this petition from time to time, some of which would be\n\nreferred to by us at the appropriate stage. In 2016, with the\n\npassing of the Aadhaar Act, these very petitioners filed another\n\nwrit petition challenging the vires of the Act. Here again, some\n\nmore writ petitions have been filed with the same objective. All\n\nthese writ petitions were clubbed together. There are number of\n\ninterventions as well by various individuals, groups, NGOs, etc.,\n\nsome opposing the petitions and some supporting the Aadhaar\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 7 of 567\n\nscheme.\n\n6) Before we go into the premise on which the attack is laid on the\n\nconstitutional validity of the Aadhaar project and the Aadhaar Act,\n\nit would be apposite to take note of the events in chronological\n\norder that shaped the formulation, take off and implementation of\n\nthe Aadhaar scheme.\n\n7) On March 03, 2006, approval was given by the Department of\n\nInformation Technology, Ministry of Communications and\n\nInformation Technology, Government of India for the project titled\n\n‘Unique Identification for BPL Families’ to be implemented by the\n\nNational Informatics Centre (NIC) for over a period of twelve\n\nmonths. As a result, a Processes Committee was set up on July\n\n03, 2006 to suggest the process for updation, modification,\n\naddition and deletion of data and fields from the core database to\n\nbe created under the Unique Identification for BPL Families\n\nproject. This Committee, on November 26, 2006, prepared a\n\npaper known as ‘Strategic Vision Unique Identification of\n\nResidents’. Based thereupon, the Empowered Group of\n\nMinisters (EGoM) was set up on December 04, 2006, to collate\n\nthe National Population Register under the\nCitizenship Act, 1955\n\nand the Unique Identification Number project of the Department\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 8 of 567\n\nof Information Technology. The EGoM was also empowered to\n\nlook into the methodology and specific milestones for early and\n\neffective completion of projects and to take a final view on these\n\nprojects. The EGoM was composed of the then Ministers of\n\nExternal Affairs, Home Affairs, Law, Panchayati Raj and\n\nCommunications and Information Technology and the then\n\nDeputy Chairman, Planning Commission.\n\n8) Various meetings on the Unique Identification (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as ‘UID’) project were held from time to time. In the\n\nfourth meeting held on December 22, 2006, various aspects of\n\nproposed data elements and their formats were discussed.\n\nThereafter, in its fifth meeting held on April 27, 2007, it was\n\ndecided that the evolution of UID database would be in three\n\nstages in principle. The Committee further decided that linkage\n\nwith major partner databases such as Household Survey of RD\n\nand the individual State Public Distribution System (PDS)\n\ndatabases should be taken up in a phased manner. On June 11,\n\n2007, at the final stage of the project, a presentation on the UID\n\nproject was made to the then Prime Minister by the Cabinet\n\nSecretary. The sixth meeting of the UID project was held on June\n\n15, 2007. The Committee, inter alia, took the following decisions:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 9 of 567\n\n(i) The numbering format of 11 digits was approved.\n\n(ii) The need for UID authority to be created by an executive\n\norder under the aegis of the Planning Commission was\n\nappreciated in order to ensure pan-departmental and neutral\n\nidentity for the authority.\n\n(iii) The proposal for creation of Central and State UIDs was\n\napproved.\n\n(iv) Department of Information Technology (DIT) was directed\n\nto work out modalities for linkage with Election Commission and\n\ninitiate discussions with MoRD and PDS for linkage.\n\n(v) In principle, approval of proposed sequence for phasing\n\nplan was granted.\n\n9) In the seventh meeting held on August 30, 2007, the proposed\n\nadministrative framework and structure of UID authority and\n\nmanpower requirement, including financial implications, was\n\ndiscussed. It was decided that a detailed proposal based on the\n\nresource model be presented to the Committee for its ‘in\n\nprinciple’ approval. At this stage, EGoM convened its first\n\nmeeting on November 27, 2007. At this meeting, a consensus\n\nemerged on the following points:\n\n(i) There is a clear need for creating an identity related\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 10 of 567\n\nresident database, regardless of whether the database is created\n\non a de novo collection of data or is based on an already existing\n\ndata (such as the Election Commission’s Voter List).\n\n(ii) Additionally, there is a critical need to create an institutional\n\nmechanism that would ‘own’ the database and be responsible for\n\nits maintenance and updating.\n\n(iii) The next meeting is to consider topics relating to collating\n\nthe National Population Register (NPR) and UID schemes,\n\nincluding methodology, effective implementation techniques,\n\nidentification of the institutional mechanism stated above, and the\n\ntime schedule for putting the scheme into operation.\n\nA series of meetings took place thereafter to work out the\n\nmodalities of the programme. Certain issues were raised therein\n\nand to address those issues, a Committee of Secretaries was\n\nformed. The said Committee gave its recommendations which\n\nwere discussed by EGoM. After approving the Aadhaar Scheme\n\nin principle, it instructed the Cabinet Secretary to convene a\n\nmeeting to finalise the detailed organisational structure of the\n\nUID.\n\n10) After considering the recommendation of the Cabinet Secretary,\n\nNotification No. A-43011/02/2009-Admn.I was issued on January\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 11 of 567\n\n28, 2009 by the Government of India which constituted and\n\nnotified the UIDAI as an attached office under the aegis of the\n\nPlanning Commission. Consequent to the constitution of UIDAI,\n\nallocation of Rs.147.31 crores for Phase I of Aadhaar enrolments\n\nwas approved by the Finance Minister on the recommendation of\n\nthe Standing Committee on Finance. Demo-Official letter dated\n\nFebruary 25, 2009, was sent by the Secretary, Planning\n\nCommission to all Chief Secretaries of 35 States/Union Territories\n\napprising them of their roles and responsibilities of the\n\nStates/Union Territories in implementation of UIDAI, such as\n\nappointment of the State/UT UID Commissioners, logistics\n\nsupport and coordination with various departments and State\n\nunits.\n\nAs they say, rest is history, which we recapitulate in brief\n\nhereinafter.\n\n11) A core group was set up to advice and further the work related to\n\nUIDAI. Budgets were allocated to UIDAI to enable it to undertake\n\nits task. Staff was also allocated to it. Meetings of the core group\n\ntook place from time to time. The core group, inter alia, decided\n\nthat it was better to start with the electoral roll database of 2009\n\nfor undertaking the UIDAI project. The status of digitisation of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 12 of 567\n\nPDS records, state-wise, was sought to be sent from the\n\nDepartment of Food and Public Distribution to the Standing\n\nCommission/UID. This and other steps taken in this direction\n\nculminated in issuance of Notification dated July 02, 2009\n\nwhereby Mr. Nandan Nilekani was appointed as the Chairman of\n\nUIDAI for an initial tenure of five years in the rank and status of a\n\nCabinet Minister. He assumed charge on July 24, 2009.\n\nThereafter, the Prime Minister’s Council of UIDAI was constituted\n\non July 30, 2009 which held its first meeting on August 12, 2009\n\nwhere the Chairman of UIDAI made detailed representation on\n\nthe broad strategy and approach of the proposed UID project.\n\nOne of the proposals was to provide a legislative framework for\n\nUID at the earliest so that it could have the legal sanction to\n\nperform its function. Some other Committees like the Biometrics\n\nStandard Committee, Demographic Data Standards and\n\nVerification Procedure Committee were set up as a support\n\nsystem to the project, which submitted their respective reports in\n\nDecember 2009. Even a Cabinet Committee on UID was\n\nconstituted vide orders dated October 22, 2009 which was\n\nheaded by the Prime Minister with the aim to cover all issues\n\nrelating to UIDAI, including its organisation, policies,\n\nprogrammes, schemes, funding and methodology to be adopted\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 13 of 567\n\nfor achieving its objectives.\n\n12) The matter was addressed in the Seventeenth Finance\n\nCommission Report also which was tabled in the Parliament on\n\nFebruary 25, 2010. In this report, the Finance Commission\n\nsuggested targeting of subsidies through UIDAI. By April 2010,\n\nUIDAI came out with its Strategy Overview. This Overview\n\ndescribes the features, benefits, revenue model and timelines of\n\nthe UIDAI project. Furthermore, it outlined the goal of the UID to\n\nserve as a universal proof of identity, allowing residents to prove\n\ntheir identities anywhere in the country. The project would give\n\nthe Government a clear view of India’s population, enabling it to\n\ntarget and deliver services effectively, achieve greater returns on\n\nsocial investments and monitor money and resource flows across\n\nthe country. It was felt that crucial to the achievement of this goal\n\nis the active participation of the central, state and local\n\nGovernments as well as public and private sector entities. Only\n\nwith their support will the project be able to realise a larger vision\n\nof inclusion and development in India.\n\n13) A Cabinet Note bearing No. 4(4)/57/2010/CC-UIDAI for the\n\nCabinet Committee on UIDAI was submitted on May 12, 2010.\n\nThe Note outlined a brief background of UIDAI, proposed an\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 14 of 567\n\napproach for collection of demographic and biometric attributes of\n\nresidents for the UID project and sought approval of the Cabinet\n\nCommittee for adoption of the aforesaid approach and suggested\n\nthat the same standards and processes be adhered to by the\n\nRegistrar General of India for the NPR exercise and all other\n\nRegistrars in the UID system. Rationale for inclusion of iris\n\nbiometrics was also submitted with the aforesaid Cabinet Note to\n\nexplain the need for capturing iris scans at the time of capturing\n\nbiometric details.\n\n14) By September 2010 enrolment process of Aadhaar began with\n\nthe nationwide launch of the Aadhaar project. In December 2010,\n\nUIDAI came out with a report on enrolment process known as\n\n‘UID Enrolment Proof-of-Concept Report’ studying enrolment\n\nproof-of-concept in three rural areas of Karnataka, Bihar and\n\nAndhra Pradesh published by the UIDAI. According to this report,\n\n‘the biometric matching analysis of 40,000 people showed that\n\nthe accuracy levels achieved by both iris and ten fingerprints\n\nwere more than an order of magnitude better compared to using\n\neither of the two individually. The multi-modal enrolment was\n\nadequate to carry out de-duplication on a much larger scale, with\n\nreasonable expectations of extending it to all residents of India’.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 15 of 567\n\n15) Going by the recommendation of the Chairman of UIDAI for\n\nproviding legislative framework to UIDAI, a Bill was introduced in\n\nthe Rajya Sabha on December 03, 2010 known as ‘National\n\nIdentification Authority of India Bill, 2010’.\n\n16) Various other steps were taken to smoothen the process of\n\nenrolment. There were studies from time to time on the\n\neffectiveness of the enrolment process. Notifications/orders were\n\nalso issued by the Reserve Bank of India stating that an Aadhaar\n\nletter would be recognised by Banks to open bank accounts for a\n\nresident. Similar Orders/Notifications were issued by other\n\nauthorities as well. On the first anniversary of Aadhaar launch,\n\nwhich fell on September 29, 2011, announcement was made that\n\n10 crores enrolments and generation of more than 3.75 crores of\n\nAadhaar had taken place. Some of the reports submitted in due\n\ncourse of time, which are relevant for our purposes, are taken\n\nnote of at this stage:\n\n(i) Report of the Task Force on an Aadhaar-Enabled Unified\n\nPayment Infrastructure for the direct transfer of subsidies on\n\nKerosene, LPG and Fertilizer.\n\n(ii) In March 2012, Fingerprint Authentication Report was\n\nsubmitted to UIDAI. This Report showcased the high accuracy\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 16 of 567\n\nrates of using fingerprints to authenticate identities. The study\n\nconducted in the rural setting representing typical demography of\n\nthe population established that it is technically possible to use\n\nfingerprint to authenticate a resident in 98.13% of the population.\n\nThe accuracy of 96.5% can be achieved using one best finger\n\nand 99.3% can be achieved using two fingers. Further\n\nimprovement is possible if the device specifications are tightened\n\nto include only the best devices and certain mechanical guide is\n\nused to aid proper placement of the finger. It was also\n\ndemonstrated through benchmarking that the authentication\n\ninfrastructure is able to sustain one million authentications per\n\nhour.\n\n(iii) Fifty Third Report of the Standing Committee on Finance on\n\nthe ‘Demands for Grants (2012-13)’ of the Ministry of Planning\n\nwas presented to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on April 24,\n\n2012. This Report summarises the objectives and financial\n\nimplications of the UID scheme being implemented under the\n\naegis of the Planning Commission.\n\n(iv) Iris Authentication Accuracy Report was submitted to UIDAI\n\non September 12, 2012. This Report based on an empirical\n\nstudy of 5833 residents demonstrated iris authentication to be\n\nviable in Indian context. With current level of device readiness for\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 17 of 567\n\niris capture, it is capable of providing coverage for 99.67% of\n\npopulation with authentication accuracy of above 99.5%.\n\nSuggestions made in this document for the vendors, once\n\nimplemented, will improve the rates further. The overall systems\n\n– network and software – have shown to meet desired\n\nrequirements in real life condition. Finally, six different devices\n\nwith variety of form and function are available to provide\n\ncompetitive vendor eco-system.\n\n(v) Background Note on Introduction to Cash Transfers was\n\nprepared by the National Committee on Direct Cash Transfers in\n\nits first meeting on November 26, 2012. This Report outlines the\n\nadvantages of cash transfers in the Indian context stating that a\n\nunique ID for all is a prerequisite for this purpose.\n\n17) At this juncture, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 was filed in\n\nwhich show-cause notice dated November 30, 2012 was issued\n\nby this Court. As pointed out above, this writ petition assailed\n\nAadhaar scheme primarily on the ground that it violates right to\n\nprivacy which is a facet of fundamental rights enshrined in\nArticle\nof the Constitution.\n\n18) Counter affidavit thereto was filed by the Union of India as well as\n\nUIDAI. The stand taken by the respondents, inter alia, was that\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 18 of 567\n\nright to privacy is not a fundamental right, which was so held by\n\nthe eight Judge Bench judgment in\nM.P. Sharma and 4 Others v.\n\nSatish Chandra Distt\n. Magistrate, Delhi and 4 Others 1. This is\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that thereafter in many judgments\n\nrendered by this Court, right to privacy was accepted as a facet of\n\nArticle 21.\nContention of the respondents, however, was that\n\nthose judgments were contrary to the dicta\nlaid down in\nM.P.\n\nSharma and were, therefore, per in curium. The matter on this\n\naspect was heard by a three Judge Bench and after hearing the\n\nparties, the Bench deemed it appropriate to make the reference\n\nto the Constitution Bench. A five Judge Bench was constituted,\n\nwhich after considering the matter, referred the same to a nine\n\nJudge Bench to resolve the controversy in an authoritative\n\nmanner. The nine Judge Bench judgment has given an\n\nunanimous answer to the Reference with conclusive,\n\nunambiguous and emphatic determination that right to privacy is\n\na part of fundamental rights which can be traced to\nArticles 14\n, 19\n\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n19) We may also record at this stage that in this petition certain\n\ninterim orders were passed from time to time. We may give the\n\ngist of some of the relevant orders:\n\n1 1954 SCR 1077\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 19 of 567\n\n(a) Order dated September 23, 2013 (two Judge Bench)\n\n“All the matters require to be heard finally. List all matters\nfor final hearing after the Constitution Bench is over.\n\nIn the meanwhile, no person should suffer for not getting\nthe Aadhaar card in spite of the fact that some authority\nhad issued a circular making it mandatory and when any\nperson applies to get the Aadhaar card voluntarily, it may\nbe checked whether that person is entitled for it under the\nlaw and it should not be given to any illegal immigrant.”\n\n(b) Order dated November 26, 2013 (two Judge Bench)\n\n“After hearing the matter at length, we are of the view that\nall the States and Union Territories have to be impleaded\nas respondents to give effective directions. In view thereof,\nnotice be issued to all the States and Union Territories\nthrough standing counsel.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nInterim order to continue, in the meantime.”\n\n(c) Order dated March 16, 2015 (three Judge Bench)\n\n“In the meanwhile, it is brought to our notice that in certain\nquarters, Aadhaar identification is being insisted upon by\nthe various authorities, we do not propose to go into the\nspecific instances.\n\nSince Union of India is represented by learned Solicitor\nGeneral and all the States are represented through their\nrespective counsel, we expect that both the Union of India\nand States and all their functionaries should adhere to the\norder passed by this Court on 23rd September, 2013.”\n\n(d) Order dated August 11, 2015 (three Judge Bench)\n\n“Having considered the matter, we are of the view that the\nbalance of interest would be best served, till the matter is\nfinally decided by a larger Bench, if the Union of India or\nthe UIDAI proceed in the following manner:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 20 of 567\n\n1. The Union of India shall give wide publicity in the\nelectronic and print media including radio and television\nnetworks that it is not mandatory for a citizen to obtain an\nAadhaar card.\n\n2. The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition\nfor obtaining any benefits otherwise due to a citizen.\n\n3. The Unique Identification Number or the Aadhaar card\nwill not be used by the respondents for any purpose other\nthan the PDS Scheme and in particular for the purpose of\ndistribution of food grains, etc. and cooking fuel, such as\nkerosene. The Aadhaar card may also be used for the\npurpose of LPG Distribution Scheme.\n\n4. The information about an individual obtained by the\nUnique Identification Authority of India while issuing an\nAadhaar card shall not be used for any other purpose,\nsave as above, except as may be directed by a Court for\nthe purpose of criminal investigation.”\n\n(d) Order dated October 15, 2015 (Constitution Bench)\n\n“3. After hearing the learned Attorney General for India and\nother learned senior counsels, we are of the view that in\nparagraph 3 of the order dated 11.08.2015, if we add, apart\nfrom the other two Schemes, namely, P.D.S. Scheme and\nL.P.G. Distribution Scheme, the Schemes like The\nMahatma Gandhi National Social Assistance Programme\n(Old Age Pensions, Widow Pensions, Disability Pensions),\nPrime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and\nEmployees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) for the\npresent, it would not dilute earlier order passed by this\nCourt. Therefore, we now include the aforesaid Schemes\napart from the other two Schemes that this Court has\npermitted in its earlier order dated 11.08.2015.\n\n4. We impress upon the Union of India that it shall strictly\nfollow all the earlier orders passed by this Court\ncommencing from 23.09.2013.\n\n5. We will also make it clear that the Aadhaar card scheme\nis purely voluntary and it cannot be made mandatory till the\nmatter is finally decided by this Court one way or the other.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 21 of 567\n\n(e) Order dated September 14, 2016 in WP (C) No. 686/2016\n\n“Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case,\nthe material evidence available on record and the\nsubmissions made by learned senior counsel, we stay the\noperation and implementation of letters dated 14.07.2006\n(i.e. Annexure P-5, P-6, P-7) for Pre-Matric Scholarship\nScheme, Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme and Merit-cum-\nMeans Scholarship Scheme to the extent they have made\nsubmission of Aadhaar mandatory and direct the Ministry of\nElectronics and Information Technology, Government of\nIndia, i.e. respondent No.2, to remove Aadhaar number as\na mandatory condition for student registration form at the\nNational Scholarship Portal of Ministry of Electronics and\nInformation Technology, Government of India at the\nwebsite...”\n\n20) It is also relevant to point out that against an order passed by the\n\nHigh Court of Bombay at Panaji, in some criminal proceedings,\n\nwherein the Authority was directed to pass on biometric\n\ninformation on a person, UIDAI had filed Special Leave Petition\n\n(Criminal) No. 2524 of 2014 challenging the said order with the\n\nsubmission that such a direction for giving biometric information\n\nwas contrary to the provisions of the Aadhaar Act and the\n\nAuthority was not supposed to give such an information, which\n\nwas confidential. In the said special leave petition, order dated\n\nMarch 24, 2014 was passed staying the operation of the orders of\n\nthe Bombay High Court. This order reads as under:\n\n“Issue notice.\n\nIn addition to normal mode of service, dasti service, is\npermitted.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 22 of 567\n\nOperation of the impugned order shall remain stayed.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the present petitioner is restrained from\ntransferring any biometric information of any person who\nhas been allotted the Aadhaar number to any other agency\nwithout his consent in writing.\n\nMore so, no person shall be deprived of any service for\nwant of Aadhaar number in case he/she is otherwise\neligible/entitled. All the authorities are directed to modify\ntheir forms/circulars/likes so as to not compulsorily require\nthe Aadhaar number in order to meet the requirement of\nthe interim order passed by this Court forthwith.\n\nTag and list the matter with main matter i.e. WP (C) No.\n494 of 2012.”\n\n21) Likewise, in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1002 of 2017 titled\nDr. Kalyan\n\nMenon Sen v. Union of India and Others\n, where constitutional\n\nvalidity of linking bank accounts and mobile phones with Aadhaar\n\nlinkage was challenged, interim order was passed on November\n\n03, 2017 extending the last date of linking to December 31, 2017\n\nand February 06, 2018 respectively. This order was extended\n\nthereafter and continues to operate.\n\n22) We would also like to refer to the order dated September 14,\n\n2011 passed in People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PDS Matter) v.\n\nUnion of India & Ors.2, wherein various directions were given to\n\nensure effective implementation of the PDS Scheme and in the\n\nprocess to also undertake the exercise of eliminating the task and\n\n2 (2011) 14 SCC 331\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 23 of 567\n\nghost ration cards. In the same manner, vide order dated March\n\n16, 2012 it was noted that the Government had set up a task\n\nforce under the Chairmanship of Mr. Nandan Nilekani to\n\nrecommend, amongst others, an IT strategy for the PDS. Mr.\n\nNilekani was requested to suggest ways and means by which\n\ncomputerization process of the PDS can be expedited.\n\nComputerisation of PDS system was directed to be prepared and\n\nin this hue the process of computerisation with Aadhaar\n\nregistration was also suggested.\n\nIn the same very case above, which also pertained to\n\nproviding night shelters to homeless destitute persons, some\n\norders were passed on February 10, 2010 3 as well as on\n\nSeptember 14, 20114.\n\n23) Again, in the case of\nState of Kerala & Ors. v. President, Parent\n\nTeachers Association SNVUP School and Ors.\n5, where the Court\n\nwas concerned with the problem of fake or bogus admissions, it\n\nwas felt that instead of involving the Police in schools to prevent\n\nfake admissions, more appropriate method of verification would\n\nbe Unique Identification (UID) card as means of verification.\n\nArchitecture of the Aadhaar Project and the Aadhaar Act:\n3 (2010) 5 SC 318\n4 (2010) 13 SCC 45\n5 (2013) 2 SCC 705\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 24 of 567\n\n24) Before adverting to the discussion on various issues that have\n\nbeen raised in these petitions, it would be apposite to first\n\nunderstand the structure of the Aadhaar Act and how it operates,\n\nhaving regard to various provisions contained therein. UIDAI was\n\nestablished in the year 2009 by an administrative order i.e. by\n\nresolution of the Govt. of India, Planning Commission, vide\n\nnotification dated January 28, 2009. The object of the\n\nestablishment of the said Authority was primarily to lay down\n\npolicies to implement the Unique Identification Scheme (for short\n\nthe ‘UIS’) of the Government, by which residents of India were to\n\nbe provided unique identity number. The aim was to serve this as\n\nproof of identity, which is unique in nature, as each individual will\n\nhave only one identity with no chance of duplication. Another\n\nobjective was that this number could be used for identification of\n\nbeneficiaries for transfer of benefits, subsidies, services and other\n\npurposes. This was the primary reason, viz. to ensure correct\n\nidentification of targeted beneficiaries for delivery of various\n\nsubsidies, benefits, services, grants, wages and other social\n\nbenefits schemes which are funded from the Consolidated Fund\n\nof India. It was felt that the identification of real and genuine\n\nbeneficiaries had become a challenge for the Government. In the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 25 of 567\n\nabsence of a credible system to authenticate identity of\n\nbeneficiaries, it was becoming difficult to ensure that the\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services reach to intended beneficiaries.\n\nAs per the Government, failure to establish identity was proving\n\nto be major hindrance for the successful implementation of the\n\nwelfare programmes and it was hitting hard the marginalised\n\nsection of the society and, in particular, women, children, senior\n\ncitizens, persons with disabilities, migrant unskilled and organised\n\nworkers, and nomadic tribes. After the establishment of the\n\nAuthority, vide the aforesaid notification, it started enrolling the\n\nresidents of this country under the UIS. These residents also\n\nstarted using Aadhaar number allotted to them. It was found that\n\nover a period of time, the use of Aadhaar number had increased\n\nmanifold. This necessitated ensuring security of the information\n\ncontained in Aadhaar number as well as the information that\n\ngenerated as a result of the use of Aadhaar numbers. It was,\n\nthus, felt desirable to back the system with a Parliamentary\n\nenactment.\n\n25) With this intention, the Aadhaar Bill was introduced with the\n\nfollowing Introduction:\n\n“The Unique Identification Authority of India was\nestablished by a resolution of the Government of India in\n2009. It was meant primarily to lay down policies and to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 26 of 567\n\nimplement the Unique Identification Scheme, by which\nresidents of India were to be provided unique identity\nnumber. This number wold serve as proof of identity and\ncould be used for identification of beneficiaries for transfer\nof benefits, subsidies, services and other purposes.\n\nLater on, it was felt that the process of enrollment,\nauthentication, security, confidentiality and use of Aadhaar\nrelated information be made statutory so as to facilitate the\nuse of Aadhaar number for delivery of various benefits,\nsubsidies and services, the expenditures of which were\nincurred from or receipts therefrom formed part of the\nConsolidated Fund of India.\n\nThe Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other\nSubsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 inter alia,\nprovides for establishment of Unique Identification Authority\nof India, issuance of Aadhaar number to individuals,\nmaintenance and updating of information in the Central\nIdentities Data Repository, issues pertaining to security,\nprivacy and confidentiality of information as well as\noffences and penalties for contravention of relevant\nstatutory provisions.”\n\n26) After mentioning the reasons recorded above, Statement of\n\nObjects and Reasons for introducing the Bill also highlight the\n\nsalient features thereof in the following manner:\n\n“5. The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other\nSubsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016, inter alia,\nseeks to provide for—\n\n(a) issue of Aadhaar numbers to individuals on providing\nhis demographic and biometric information to the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India;\n\n(b) requiring Aadhaar numbers for identifying an individual\nfor delivery of benefits, subsidies, and services the\nexpenditure is incurred from or the receipt therefrom forms\npart of the Consolidated Fund of India;\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 27 of 567\n\n(c) authentication of the Aadhaar number of an Aadhaar\nnumber holder in relation to his demographic and biometric\ninformation;\n\n(d) establishment of the Unique Identification Authority of\nIndia consisting of a Chairperson, two Members and a\nMember-Secretary to perform functions in pursuance of the\nobjectives above;\n\n(e) maintenance and updating the information of\nindividuals in the Central Identities Data Repository in such\nmanner as may be specified by regulations;\n\n(f) measures pertaining to security, privacy and\nconfidentiality of information in possession or control of the\nAuthority including information stored in the Central\nIdentities Data Repository; and\n\n(g) offences and penalties for contravention of relevant\nstatutory provisions.”\n\n27) The Bill having been passed by the Legislature, received the\n\nassent of the President on March 25, 2016 and, thus, became Act\n\n(18 of 2016). Preamble to this Act again emphasises the aim and\n\nobjective which this Act seeks to achieve. It reads:\n\n“\nAn Act\nto provide for, as a good governance, efficient,\ntransparent, and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits\nand services, the expenditure for which is incurred from the\nConsolidated Fund of India, to individuals residing in India\nthrough assigning of unique identity numbers to such\nindividuals and for matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto”\n\n28)\nSection 2\nof the Act provides certain definitions. Some of the\n\ndefinitions can be noted at this stage itself, while other relevant\n\ndefinitions would be mentioned at the appropriate stage.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 28 of 567\n\n“(a) “Aadhaar number” means an identification number\nissued to an individual under sub-section (3) of\nSection 3\n;\n\n(b) “Aadhaar number holder” means an individual who has\nbeen issued an Aadhaar number under this Act;\n\n(c) “authentication” means the process by which the\nAadhaar number along with demographic information or\nbiometric information of an individual is submitted to the\nCentral Identities Data Repository for its verification and\nsuch Repository verifies the correctness, or the lack\nthereof, on the basis of information available with it;\n\n(d) “authentication record” means the record of the time of\nauthentication and identity of the requesting entity and the\nresponse provided by the Authority thereto;\n\nxx xx xx\n\n(f) “benefit” means any advantage, gift, reward, relief, or\npayment, in cash or kind, provided to an individual or a\ngroup of individuals and includes such other benefits as\nmay be notified by the Central Government;\n\n(g) “biometric information” means photograph, finger print,\nIris scan, or such other biological attributes of an individual\nas may be specified by regulations;\n\n(h) “Central Identities Data Repository” means a\ncentralised database in one or more locations containing\nall Aadhaar numbers issued to Aadhaar number holders\nalong with the corresponding demographic information and\nbiometric information of such individuals and other\ninformation related thereto;\n\nxx xx xx\n\n(j) “core biometric information” means finger print, Iris\nscan, or such other biological attribute of an individual as\nmay be specified by regulations;\n\n(k) “demographic information” includes information relating\nto the name, date of birth, address and other relevant\ninformation of an individual, as may be specified by\nregulations for the purpose of issuing an Aadhaar number,\nbut shall not include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 29 of 567\n\nlanguage, records of entitlement, income or medical\nhistory;\n\n(l) “enrolling agency” means an agency appointed by the\nAuthority or a Registrar, as the case may be, for collecting\ndemographic and biometric information of individuals under\nthis Act;\n\n(m) “enrollment” means the process, as may be specified\nby regulations, to collect demographic and biometric\ninformation from individuals by the enrolling agencies for\nthe purpose of issuing Aadhaar numbers to such\nindividuals under this Act;\n\n(n) “identity information” in respect of an individual,\nincludes his Aadhaar number, his biometric information and\nhis demographic information;\n\nxx xx xx\n\n(r) “records of entitlement” means records of benefits,\nsubsidies or services provided to, or availed by, any\nindividual under any programme;\n\nxx xx xx\n\n(u) “requesting entity” means an agency or person that\nsubmits the Aadhaar number, and demographic information\nor biometric information, of an individual to the Central\nIdentities Data Repository for authentication;\n\n(v) “resident” means an individual who has resided in India\nfor a period or periods amounting in all to one hundred and\neighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately\npreceding the date of application for enrolment;\n\n(w) “service” means any provision, facility, utility or any\nother assistance provided in any form to an individual or a\ngroup of individuals and includes such other services as\nmay be notified by the Central Government;\n\n(x) “subsidy” means any form of aid, support, grant,\nsubvention, or appropriation, in cash or kind, to an\nindividual or a group of individuals and includes such other\nsubsidies as may be notified by the Central Government.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 30 of 567\n\n29)\nChapter II of the Act\ndeals with enrolment.\nSection 3\nin this\n\nChapter entitles every resident to obtain the Aadhaar number by\n\nsubmitting his demographic information and biometric\n\ninformation. As noted above, demographic information includes\n\ninformation relating to the name, date of birth, address and ‘other\n\nrelevant information of an individual, as may be specified by\n\nregulations for the purpose of issuing an Aadhaar number’.\n\nPhotograph, fingerprint, iris scan, ‘or such other biological\n\nattribute of an individual as may be specified by regulations’ are\n\ntreated as biometric information. Sub-section (2) of\nSection 3\n\nstipulates that the enrolling agency shall, at the time of enrolment,\n\ninform the individual undergoing enrolment of the following details\n\nin such manner as may be specified by regulations, namely:\n\n(a) the manner in which the information shall be used;\n\n(b) the nature of recipients with whom the information is\n\nintended to be shared during authentication; and\n\n(c) the existence of a right to access information, the procedure\n\nfor making requests for such access, and details of the person or\n\ndepartment in-charge to whom such requests can be made.\n\n30)\nSection 4\n, inter alia, provides that Aadhaar number issued to an\n\nindividual shall not be reassigned to any individual. In this sense,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 31 of 567\n\nit makes an Aadhaar number given to a particular individual\n\n‘unique’.\nSection 5\ndelineates special measures for issuance of\n\nAadhaar number to certain categories of persons and reads as\n\nunder:\n\n“5. Special measures for issuance of Aadhaar number\nto certain category of persons.— The Authority shall take\nspecial measures to issue Aadhaar number to women,\nchildren, senior citizens, persons with disability, unskilled\nand unorganised workers, nomadic tribes or to such other\npersons who do not have any permanent dwelling house\nand such other categories of individuals as may be\nspecified by regulations.”\n\n31)\nSection 6\nenables the Authority to update demographic and\n\nbiometric information of the Aadhaar number holders from time to\n\ntime.\n\n32) Chapter III deals with ‘authentication’, which has generated the\n\nmaximum debate in these proceedings.\nSection 7\nfalling under\n\nthis Chapter mandates that proof of Aadhaar number would be\n\nnecessary for receipt of certain subsidies, benefits and services\n\netc. meaning thereby for availing such subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices, it would be necessary for the intended beneficiary to\n\npossess Aadhaar number. In case of an individual to whom no\n\nAadhaar number has been assigned, he/she would be required to\n\nshow that application for enrolment has been given. Where the\n\nAadhaar number is not assigned, proviso to\nSection 7\nlays down\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 32 of 567\n\nthat the individual shall be offered alternate and viable means of\n\nidentification for delivery of subsidy, benefit or service.\nSection 8\n\ndeals with authentication of Aadhaar number and provides that on\n\nsubmission of request by any requesting entity, the Authority shall\n\nperform authentication of Aadhaar number. This authentication is\n\nin relation to biometric information or demographic information of\n\nan Aadhaar number holder. Before collecting identity information\n\nfor the purpose of authentication, the requesting entity is to obtain\n\nconsent of an individual and also to ensure that the identity\n\ninformation of that individual is only used for submission to the\n\nCentral Identities Data Repository (CIDR) for authentication.\n\nSections 7\nand\nread as under:\n\n“7. Proof of Aadhaar number necessary for receipt of\ncertain subsidies, benefits and services, etc.— The\nCentral Government or, as the case may be, the State\nGovernment may, for the purpose of establishing identity of\nan individual as a condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit\nor service for which the expenditure is incurred from, or the\nreceipt therefrom forms part of, the Consolidated Fund of\nIndia, require that such individual undergo authentication,\nor furnish proof of possession of Aadhaar number or in the\ncase of an individual to whom no Aadhaar number has\nbeen assigned, such individual makes an application for\nenrolment:\n\nProvided that if an Aadhaar number is not assigned\nto an individual, the individual shall be offered alternate and\nviable means of identification for delivery of the subsidy,\nbenefit or service.\n\n8.

Notification dated July 12, 2016 was issued by\n\nthe Central Government establishing the Authority. Other\n\nprovisions in this Chapter deal with the composition of the\n\nAuthority, qualifications for appointment of the Chairperson and\n\nMembers of Authority; term of their office and their removal; and\n\nrestrictions on their employment after cessation of office. It also\n\nprovides for the functions of Chairperson as well as office of the\n\nChief Executive Officer (CEO) and his functions and the\n\nmeetings of the Authority etc. Powers and functions of the\n\nAuthority are stipulated in\nSection 23\n.\n\n35) Chapter V talks of grants to the Authority by the Central\n\nGovernment as well as accounts and audit and annual report of\n\nthe Authority.\n\n36) Chapter VI deals with the important aspects pertaining to\n\n‘protection of information’. Section 28 of the Aadhaar Act puts an\n\nobligation on the Authority to ensure the security of identity\n\ninformation and authentication records of individuals. Likewise,\n\nSection 29\nimposes certain restrictions on sharing information i.e.\n\ncore biometric information collected or created under the Act or\n\nthe identity information. The biometric information collected and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 35 of 567\n\nstored in electronic form, in accordance with this Act and\n\nregulations made thereunder, is treated as ‘electronic record’ and\n\n‘sensitive personal data or information’ by virtue of\nSection 30\nof\n\nthe Act.

For the purpose of enrolment and assigning Aadhaar\n\nnumbers, enrolling agencies are recruited by the Authority. All the\n\nresidents in India are eligible to obtain an Aadhaar number. To\n\nenable a resident to get Aadhaar number, he is required to submit\n\ndemographic as well as biometric information i.e., apart from\n\ngiving information relating to name, date of birth and address,\n\nbiometric information in the form of photograph, fingerprint, iris\n\nscan is also to be provided. Aadhaar number given to a particular\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 49 of 567\n\nperson is treated as unique number as it cannot be reassigned to\n\nany other individual.\n\nInsofar as subsidies, benefits or services to be given by the\n\nCentral Government or the State Government, as the case may\n\nbe, is concerned, these Governments can mandate that receipt of\n\nthese subsidies, benefits and services would be given only on\n\nfurnishing proof of possession of Aadhaar number (or proof of\n\nmaking an application for enrolment, where Aadhaar number is\n\nnot assigned). An added requirement is that such individual\n\nwould undergo authentication at the time of receiving such\n\nbenefits etc. A particular institution/body from which the aforesaid\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service is to be claimed by such an individual,\n\nthe intended recipient would submit his Aadhaar number and is\n\nalso required to give her biometric information to that agency. On\n\nreceiving this information and for the purpose of its\n\nauthentication, the said agency, known as Requesting Entity,\n\nwould send the request to the Authority which shall perform the\n\njob of authentication of Aadhaar number. On confirming the\n\nidentity of a person, the individual is entitled to receive subsidy,\n\nbenefit or service. Aadhaar number is permitted to be used by\n\nthe holder for other purposes as well.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 50 of 567\n\n44) In this whole process, any resident seeking to obtain an Aadhaar\n\nnumber is, in the first instance, required to submit her\n\ndemographic information and biometric information at the time of\n\nenrolment. She, thus, parts with her photograph, fingerprint and\n\niris scan at that stage by giving the same to the enrolling agency,\n\nwhich may be a private body/person. Likewise, every time when\n\nsuch Aadhaar holder intends to receive a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice and goes to specified/designated agency or person for\n\nthat purpose, she would be giving her biometric information to\n\nthat requesting entity, which, in turn, shall get the same\n\nauthenticated from the Authority before providing a subsidy,\n\nbenefit or service. Whenever request is received for\n\nauthentication by the Authority, record of such a request is kept\n\nand stored in the CIDR. At the same time, provisions for\n\nprotection of such information/data have been made, as indicated\n\nabove. Aadhaar number can also be used for purposes other\n\nthan stated in the Act i.e. purposes other than provided under\n\nSection 7\nof the Act, as mentioned in\nSection 57\nof the Act, which\n\npermit the State or any body corporate or person, pursuant to any\n\nlaw, for the time being in force, or any contract to this effect, to\n\nuse the Aadhaar number for establishing the identity of an\n\nindividual. It can be used as a proof of identity, like other identity\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 51 of 567\n\nproofs such as PAN card, ration card, driving licence, passport\n\netc.\n\n45) Piercing into the aforesaid Aadhaar programme and its\n\nformation/structure under the Aadhaar Act, foundational\n\narguments are that it is a grave risk to the rights and liberties of\n\nthe citizens of this country which are secured by the Constitution\n\nof India. It militates against the constitutional abiding values and\n\nits foundational morality and has the potential to enable an\n\nintrusive state to become a surveillance state on the basis of\n\ninformation that is collected in respect of each individual by\n\ncreation of a joint electronic mesh.\nIn this manner, the Act strikes\n\nat the very privacy of each individual thereby offending the right\n\nto privacy which is elevated and given the status of fundamental\n\nright by tracing it to\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia by a nine Judge Bench judgment of this Court in\nK.S.\n\nPuttaswamy & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors.6\n. Most of the counsel\n\nappearing for different petitioners (though not all) conceded that\n\nthere cannot be a serious dispute insofar as allotment of Aadhaar\n\nnumber, for the purpose of unique identification of the residents,\n\nis concerned. However, apprehensions have been expressed\n\nabout the manner in which the Scheme has been rolled out and\n\n6 (2017) 10 SCC 1\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 52 of 567\n\nimplemented. The entire edifice of the aforesaid projection is\n\nbased on the premise that it forces a person, who intends to enrol\n\nfor Aadhaar, to part with his core information namely biometric\n\ninformation in the form of fingerprints and iris scan. These are to\n\nbe given to the enrolment agency in the first instance which is a\n\nprivate body and, thus, there is risk of misuse of this vital\n\ninformation pertaining to an individual. Further, it is argued that\n\nthe most delicate and fragile part, susceptible to misuse, is the\n\nauthentication process which is to be carried out each time the\n\nholder of Aadhaar number wants to establish her identity. At that\n\nstage, not only the individual parts with the biometric information\n\nagain with the RE (which may again be a private agency as well),\n\nthe purpose for which such a person approaches the RE would\n\nalso be known i.e. the nature of transaction which is supposed to\n\nbe undertaken by the said person at that time. Such information\n\nrelating to different transactions of a person across the life of the\n\ncitizen is connected to a central database. This record may\n\nenable the State to profile citizens, track their movements, assess\n\ntheir habits and silently influence their behaviour. Over a period\n\nof time, the profiling would enable the State to stifle dissent and\n\ninfluence political decision making. It may also enable the State\n\nto act as a surveillant state and there is a propensity for it to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 53 of 567\n\nbecome a totalitarian state. It is stressed that at its core, Aadhaar\n\nalters the relationship between the citizen and the State. It\n\ndiminishes the status of the citizen. Rights freely exercised,\n\nliberties freely enjoyed, entitlements granted by the Constitution\n\nand laws are all made conditional, on a compulsory barter. The\n\nbarter compels the citizen to give up her biometrics ‘voluntarily’,\n\nallow her biometrics and demographic information to be stored by\n\nthe State and private operators and then used for a process\n\ntermed ‘authentication’.\n\nTo put it in nutshell, provisions of the Aadhaar Act are\n\nperceived by the petitioners as giving away of vital information\n\nabout the residents to the State not only in the form of biometrics\n\nbut also about the movement as well as varied kinds of\n\ntransactions which a resident would enter into from time to time.\n\nThe threat is in the form of profiling the citizens by the State on\n\nthe one hand and also misuse thereof by private agencies\n\nwhether it is enrolling agency or requesting agency or even\n\nprivate bodies mentioned in\nSection 57\nof the Act. In essence, it\n\nis stated that not only data of aforesaid nature is stored by the\n\nCIDR, which has the threat of being leaked, it can also be\n\nmisused by non-State actors. In other words, it is sought to be\n\nhighlighted that there is no assurance of any data protection at\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 54 of 567\n\nany level.\n\n46) The respondents, on the other hand, have attempted to shake the\n\nvery foundation of the aforesaid structure of the petitioners’ case.\n\nThey argue that in the first instance, minimal biometric\n\ninformation of the applicant, who intends to have Aadhaar\n\nnumber, is obtained which is also stored in CIDR for the purpose\n\nof authentication. Secondly, no other information is stored. It is\n\nemphasised that there is no data collection in respect of religion,\n\ncaste, tribe, language records of entitlement, income or medical\n\nhistory of the applicant at the time of Aadhaar enrolment. Thirdly,\n\nthe Authority also claimed that the entire Aadhaar enrolment eco-\n\nsystem is foolproof inasmuch as within few seconds of the\n\nbiometrics having been collected by the enrolling agency, the said\n\ninformation gets transmitted the Authorities/CIDR, that too in an\n\nencrypted form, and goes out of the reach of the enrolling\n\nagency. Same is the situation at the time of authentication as\n\nbiometric information does not remain with the requesting\n\nagency. Fourthly, while undertaking the authentication process,\n\nthe Authority simply matches the biometrics and no other\n\ninformation is received or stored in respect of purpose, location or\n\nnature or transaction etc. Therefore, the question of profiling does\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 55 of 567\n\nnot arise at all. A powerpoint presentation was given by Dr. Ajay\n\nBhushan Pandey, CEO of the Authority, in the Court, while\n\nexplaining various nuances of the whole process. In this\n\npresentation, the enrolment process has been projected in the\n\nfollowing manner:\n\n47) Insofar as Aadhaar authentication service is concerned, it was\n\nexplained that the same is e-KYC wherein following process is\n\ninvolved:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 56 of 567\n\n48) It was asserted with all vehemence that while doing the aforesaid\n\nauthentication, no other information is collected or stored by the\n\nAuthority/CIDR, specifically pointing that:\n\n(a) The Authority does not collect purpose, location or details of\n\ntransaction. Thus, it is purpose blind.\n\n(b) The information collected as aforesaid remains in silos.\n\n(c) Merging of silos is prohibited.\n\n(d) The RE is provided answer only in Yes or No about the\n\nauthentication of the person concerned.\n\n(e) The authentication process is not exposed to the internet\n\nworld.\n\n(f) Security measures as per the provisions of\nSection 29(3)\n\nread with Section 38(g) as well as Regulation 17(1)(d) of the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 57 of 567\n\nAuthentication Regulations are strictly followed and adhere to.\n\nThe Aadhaar Authentication Security has been described in\n\nthe following manner:\n\n49) In this hue, the Authority has projected that the Aadhaar design\n\ntakes full care of privacy and security of the persons. It is sought\n\nto be demonstrated by pointing out the following features:\n\n(i) Privacy is ensured by the very design of Aadhaar which was\n\nconceived by the Authority from very inception and is now even\n\nincarnated in the Aadhaar Act because : (a) it is backed by\n\nminimal data, federated databases, optimal ignorance; and (b)\n\nthere is no transaction/pooling data coupled with the fact that\n\nresident authorised access to identity data is available.\n\n(ii) Aadhaar is designed for inclusion inasmuch as : (a) there is\n\nflexibility of demographic data, multi-modal biometrics, and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 58 of 567\n\nflexible processes; (b) DDSVP Committee by Dr. V.N. Vittal,\n\nformer CVC; and (c) Biometric design and Standards Committee\n\nby Dr. Gairola, Former DG, NIC.\n\n(iii) All security numbers are followed which can be seen from:\n\n(a) PKI-2048 encryption from the time of capture, (b) adoption of\n\nbest-in-class security standards and practices, and (c) strong\n\naudit and traceability as well as fraud detection.\n\n50) It was explained that the security and data privacy is ensured in\n\nthe following way:\n\n(i) The data sent to ABIS is completely anonymised. The ABIS\n\nsystems do not have access to resident’s demographic\n\ninformation as they are only sent biometric information of a\n\nresident with a reference number and asked to de-duplicate. The\n\nde-duplication result with the reference number is mapped back\n\nto the correct enrolment number by the Authorities own enrolment\n\nserver.\n\n(ii) The ABIS providers only provide their software and\n\nservices. The data is stored in UIDAI storage and it never leaves\n\nthe secure premises.\n\n(iii) The ABIS providers do not store the biometric images\n\n(source). They only store template for the purpose of de-\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 59 of 567\n\nduplication (with reference number).\n\n(iv) The encrypted enrolment packet sent by the enrolment\n\nclient software to the CIDR is decrypted by the enrolment server\n\nbut the decrypted packet is never stored.\n\n(v) The original biometric images of fingerprints, iris and face\n\nare archived and stored offline. Hence, they cannot be accessed\n\nthrough an online network.\n\n(vi) The biometric system provides high accuracy of over\n\n99.86%. The mixed biometric have been adopted only t enhance\n\nthe accuracy and to reduce the errors which may arise on\n\naccount of some residents either not having biometrics or not\n\nhaving some particular biometric.\n\n51) Above all, there is an oversight by Technology and Architecture\n\nReview Board (TARB) and Security Review Committee. This\n\nBoard and Committee consists of very high profiled officers. The\n\naforesaid security measures are shown by the Authority in the\n\nfollowing manner:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 60 of 567\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 61 of 567\n\n52) We may point out at this stage that to the powerpoint\n\npresentation by Dr. Pandey on the aforesaid lines, certain\n\nquestions were put to him by Mr. Shyam Divan as well as Mr.\n\nVishwanathan, senior advocates, and the answers thereto were\n\ngiven by Dr. Pandey. In order to have the complete picture, we\n\nwill be well advised to reproduce these questions and their\n\nanswers as well, which are as follows:\n\n53) Questions and Answers to the queries raised by the petitioners in\nW.P. (C) No. 1056 of 2017 entitled ‘Nachiket Udupa & Anr. v.\n\nUnion of India\n\n(1) What are the figures for authentication failures, both at the\n\nnational and state level? Please provide a breakup, between\n\nfingerprints and iris.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 62 of 567\n\nAns.: UIDAI cannot provide authentication failure rates at the\n\nstate level since it does not track the location of the authentication\n\ntransactions. Authentication failure rate at national level is as\n\nbelow:\n\nModality Unique UID Failed Unique ID Failed Percentage\nParticipated\nIRIS 1,08,50,391 9,27,132 8.54%\nFINGER 61,63,63,346 3,69,62,619 6.00%\n\nIt must be stated that authentication failures do not mean\n\nexclusion or denial from subsidies, benefits or services since the\n\nrequesting entities are obliged under the law to provide for\n\nexception handling mechanisms.\n\n(2) In case a person who is claiming a biometric exception (e.g.\n\na person suffering from leprosy) does not have a mobile phone\n\nnumber, or has not given it in the enrolment form, or if the phone\n\nnumber changes – how will her Aadhaar enrolment and\n\nsubsequent authentication occur and under which provision of\n\nlaw?\n\nAns.: Aadhaar enrolment is done for all residents, even of\n\nresidents with leprosy. Biometric exception process is defined in\n\nthe UIDAI resident enrolment process. In the case of a leprosy\n\npatient, who may not be able to do fingerprint authentication, iris\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 63 of 567\n\nauthentication can be used for update (and add the mobile\n\nnumber). This was the reason for multi-modal enrolment and\n\nauthentication being selected for use in Aadhaar.\n\nOnly in an unlikely scenario where both iris and fingerprint\n\ncannot be used for authentication, the mobile number is one of\n\nthe methods for authentication. In cases where authentication\n\nthrough mobile number is not possible or feasible, the requesting\n\nentities have to provide their own exception and backup\n\nmechanism to ensure services to Aadhaar holders. As part of the\n\nexception handling mechanism, UIDAI has already implemented\n\na digitally signed QR code into e-Aadhaar which allows agencies\n\nto verify the Aadhaar card in an off-line manner and trust the data\n\n(based on digital signature validation) without accessing e-KYC\n\nAPI service of UIDAI. This is a simple off-line mechanism to\n\nquickly verify the legitimacy of the Aadhaar card. But, it does not\n\nensure that the person holding the card is the owner of that\n\nAadhaar number. It needs either manual check of photo against\n\nthe face of the individual (like the way ID is verified at the entry of\n\nairports) or some form of electronic authentication using Aadhaar\n\nauthentication API or agency specific authentication scheme. QR\n\ncode based verification allows Aadhaar number holders to use\n\ntheir ID on a day-to-day purpose without using online e-KYC\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 64 of 567\n\nauthentication. The verification through offline QR code can be\n\nused for those purposes or cases where proof of presence or\n\nproof of ownership of card is not required.\n\nThe Aadhaar Act and Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\nRegulations, 2016 define special provision for enrolment of\n\nresidents with biometric exception. Further, as per\nRegulation\n\n14(i)\nof the Authentication Regulations, RE shall implement\n\nexception-handling mechanisms and backup identity\n\nauthentication mechanisms to ensure seamless provision of\n\nauthentication services to Aadhaar number holders. Accordingly,\n\nDBT Mission Cabinet Secretariat has issued a detailed circular\n\ndated December 19, 2017 regarding exception handling during\n\nuse of Aadhaar in the benefit schemes of the Government.\n\n(3) Are there any surprise checks, field studies done to check\n\nthe authenticity of the exemption registers?\n\nAns.: As per\nRegulation 14(i)\nof the Authentication Regulations,\n\nthis exception handling mechanism is to be implemented and\n\nmonitored by the requesting entities and in case of the\n\nGovernment, their respective Ministries. Further, the DBT\n\nMission Cabinet Secretariat had issued Circular dated December\n\n19, 2017 on exception handling and audit of exceptions.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 65 of 567\n\n(4) Between the ages of 5-15 years, can a school, as an\n\n‘introducer’, enrol a child without parental consent?\n\nAns.: School officials, if permitted to act as ‘introducer’, can enrol\n\nonly when there is a parental consent to enrol. The disclosure\n\nrequirement as per Section 3(2) of the Aadhaar Act and the\n\nAadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016 (Schedule-I)\n\nis implemented through the enrolment form which is signed by the\n\nresident making it informed disclosure. In case of children, the\n\nconsent form will be signed by the parent/guardian.\n\n(5) Once a child attains the age of 18 years, is there any way\n\nfor them to opt out or revoke consent?\n\nAns.: It is not permissible under the Aadhaar Act. However,\n\nresidents have the option of permanently locking their biometrics\n\nand only temporarily unlock it when needed for biometric\n\nauthentication as per\nRegulation 11\nof the Authentication\n\nRegulations.\n\n(6) What is the status of the enrolments done by the 49,000\n\nblacklisted enrolment operators? Please provide the number of\n\nenrolments done by them?\n\nAns.: UIDAI has a policy to enforce the process guidelines and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 66 of 567\n\ndata quality check during the enrolment process. 100% of the\n\nenrolment done by operators undergoes a quality assurance\n\ncheck, wherein every enrolment passes through a human eye.\n\nAny Aadhaar enrolment found to be contrary to the UIDAI\n\nprocess, the enrolment itself gets rejected and Aadhaar is not\n\ngenerated. The resident is advised to re-enroll. Once an\n\noperator is blacklisted or suspended, further enrolments cannot\n\nbe carried out by him during the time the order of\n\nblacklisting/suspension is valid.\n\n(7) What are the total number of biometric De-duplication\n\nrejections that have taken place till date? In case an enrolment is\n\nrejected either for: (a) duplicate enrolment and (b) other technical\n\nreason under\nRegulation 14\nof the Aadhaar Enrolment\n\nRegulations, what happens to the data packet that contains the\n\nstored biometric and demographic information?\n\nAns.: The total number of biometric de-duplication rejections that\n\nhave taken place are 6.91 crores as on March 21, 2018. These\n\nfigures do not pertain to the number of unique individuals who\n\nhave been denied Aadhaar enrolment resulting in no Aadhaar\n\nissued to them. This figure merely pertains to the number of\n\napplications which have been identified by the Aadhaar de-\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 67 of 567\n\nduplication system as having matching biometrics to an existing\n\nAadhaar number holder. The biometric de-duplication system is\n\ndesigned to identify as duplicate those cases where any one of\n\nthe biometrics (ten fingers and two irises) match. However, very\n\noften it is found that all the biometrics match. It is highly\n\nimprobable for the biometrics to match unless the same person\n\nhas applied again. There are a number of reasons why the same\n\nperson might apply more than once. For instance, many\n\nindividuals innocently apply for enrolment multiple times because\n\nof the delay in getting their Aadhaar cards due to postal delays,\n\nloss or destruction of their cards or confusion about how the\n\nsystem works. Each time one applies for Aadhaar, the system\n\nidentifies her as a new enrolment but when it recognises that the\n\nindividual’s biometrics match with already those in the database,\n\nthereafter further checks, including manual check through\n\nexperienced personnels, are done. After that exercise, if it is\n\nfound that the person is already registered, it rejects the\n\nenrolment application. One of their main reasons for rejection is\n\nthat multiple people would put their biometric details like\n\nfingerprints for Aadhaar generation either as a fraudulent exercise\n\nor by mistake, which also would get rejected. There were many\n\nfakes and frauds in the earlier systems and several reports have\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 68 of 567\n\nfound that almost 50% of the subsidies were getting pilfered away\n\nby fakes and duplicates in the system. Then, there would also be\n\nseveral such people who may have tried to defraud the Aadhaar\n\nenrolment system as well but failed get multiple Aadhaar numbers\n\ndue to the stringent Aadhaar de-duplication process. Thus, the\n\nmere fact that 6.23 crore enrolments have been rejected as\n\nbiometric duplicates does not mean that 6.23 crore people have\n\nbeen denied an Aadhaar number as has been alleged by the\n\npetitioners. Any genuine person who does not have an Aadhaar\n\nnumber and whose enrolment has been rejected can always\n\napply again for enrolment. It is worth noting that none of the de-\n\nduplication rejects have come forward to lodge complaints either\n\nwith the Authority or with the Government about denial of Aadhaar\n\nnumber. None of them have even approached any Court of law.\n\nEvidently, the genuine residents have got themselves re-enrolled\n\nand the rest are those who were trying to reach the Aadhaar\n\nsystem by fraudulent means. That explains why no one has\n\napproached a court of law complaining denial of Aadhaar number.\n\nAll the enrolment packets received by UIDAI (accepted/rejected)\n\nare archived in the CIDR irrespective of its status.\n\n(8) If the figure of rejection of enrolment packets was 8 crore,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 69 of 567\n\nas on 2015, what is the total rejection figure for enrolment\n\npackets as on date? How many field studies/physical verification\n\nhave been done to ensure that these persons (who have been\n\nrejected) are indeed “False or duplicate” enrolments?\n\nAns.: The total rejection figure for enrolment packets is 18.0 cr.\n\nas on March 26, 2018. These rejections are due to various\n\ntechnical reasons like: (i) data quality reject such as address\n\nincomplete, name incomplete, use of expletives in names,\n\naddress etc. photo is of object, photo of photo, age photo\n\nmismatch etc.; and (ii) OSI validation reject such as operator /\n\nsupervisor / introducer validation failed, operator / supervisor /\n\nintroducer / Head of Family biometric validation failed etc.\n\nThose whose enrolments have been rejected for any reason\n\nand who do not have Aadhaar can re-enrol and obtain Aadhaar.\n\nRejection of enrolments do not mean that the person will never be\n\nable to get Aadhaar.\n\n(9) What does “any other appropriate response” under Section\n\n8(4) of the Aadhaar Act include?\n\nAns.: “Any other appropriate responses” includes e-KYC or\n\nlimited e-KYC data. As per\nRegulation 3\nof Authentication\n\nRegulations, UIDAI provides two types of authentication facilities,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 70 of 567\n\nnamely -\n\n(i) Yes/No authentication facility; and\n\n(ii) e-KYC authentication facility.\n\nIn Yes/No authentication, UIDAI provides the response as\n\nYes or No along with relevant error codes, if any.\n\nIn e-KYC authentication, UIDAI provides the demographic\n\ndata along with photograph and in case of mismatch/error, the\n\nrelevant error codes.\n\n54) Questions and Answers to the queries raised by the petitioners in\nW.P. (C) No. 829 of 2013 entitled\n‘S.G. Vombatkere & Anr. v.\nUnion of India\n\n(1) Please confirm that no UIDAI official verifies the correctness\n\nof documents offered at the stage of enrolment/updating.\n\nAns.: As per UIDAI process, the verification of the documents is\n\nentrusted to the Registrar. For Verification based on Documents,\n\nthe verifier present at the Enrolment Centre will verify the\n\ndocuments. Registrars/Enrolment agency must appoint personnel\n\nfor the verification of documents.\n\n(2) Please confirm that UIDAI does not know whether the\n\ndocuments shown at the time of enrolment/updating are genuine\n\nor false.\n\nAns.: The answer is same as in (1) above.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 71 of 567\n\n(3) Please confirm:\n\n(a) UIDAI does not identify the persons it only matches the\n\nbiometric information received at the time of authentication with\n\nits records and provides a Yes/No response;\n\nAns.: Biometric authentication of an Aadhaar number holder is\n\nalways performed as 1:1 biometric match against his/her Aadhaar\n\nnumber (identity) in CIDR. Based on the match, UIDAI provides\n\nYes or No response. A “Yes” response means a positive\n\nidentification of the Aadhaar number holder.\n\nEach enrolment is biometrically de-duplicated against all\n\n(1.2 billion) residents to issue the Aadhaar number (or Unique\n\nIdentity).\n\n(b) UIDAI takes no responsibility with respect to the correctness\n\nof the name, date of birth or address of the person enrolled.\n\nAns.: The Name/Address/DOB are derived from the Proof of\n\nIdentity (POI)/Proof of Address (POA) documents submitted\n\nduring enrolments.\n\nThe enrolment/update packet (encrypted) retains a scanned\n\ncopy of the POI/POA documents used for the enrolment which\n\ncan be reviewed in case of dispute.\n\nUIDAI maintains the update history of each Aadhaar\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 72 of 567\n\nnumber related to changes in name, address, date of birth etc.\n\n(4) Please confirm:\n\n(a) UIDAI takes no responsibility with respect to the correct\n\nidentification of a person.\n\nAns.: Please refer to Answer (1) above. Additionally, it may be\n\nstated that enrolment of Aadhaar is done through a resident\n\nenrolment process and verification of the POI/POA document is\n\ndone against the acceptable documents, as per the UIDAI valid\n\nlist of documents as provided in Schedule II and III Aadhaar\n\n(Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016 read with Regulation\n\n10.\n\nUIDAI takes responsibility in creating and implementing\n\nstandards, ensuring matching systems installed in CIDR work as\n\nthey are designed to do, and providing options to Aadhaar\n\nholders in terms of controlling their identity (such as updating their\n\ndata, locking their biometrics, etc.) and accessing their own\n\nauthentication records. One of the key goals of Aadhaar is to\n\nissue a unique identity for the residents of India. Hence, each\n\nenrolment is biometrically de-duplicated against all (1.2 billion)\n\nresidents to issue the Aadhaar number (or Unique Identity).\n\nSection 4\nof Aadhaar lays down the properties of an\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 73 of 567\n\nAadhaar number. Sub-section (3) of\nSection 4\nreads as under:\n\n“(3) An Aadhaar number, in physical or electronic form\nsubject to authentication and other conditions, as may be\nspecified by regulations, may be accepted as proof of\nidentity of the Aadhaar number holder for any purpose.”\n\nThe requesting entities are at liberty to use any or multiple\n\nof authentication mode available under\nRegulation 4\nof Aadhaar\n\n(Authentication) Regulation, 2016 as per their requirements and\n\nneeds of security etc.\n\n(b) The biometric authentication is based on a probabilistic\n\nmatch of the biometric captured during authentication and the\n\nrecord stored with CIDR.\n\nAns.: Biometric authentication is based on 1:1 matching and,\n\ntherefore, in that sense it is not probabilistic. If biometrics are\n\ncaptured it will lead to successful authentication. If biometrics are\n\nnot well captured during authentication or an impostor tries\n\nauthentication, it will lead to authentication failure. Aadhaar Proof\n\nof Concept studies show that a vast majority of residents (>98%)\n\ncan successfully authenticate using biometric modalities such\n\nfingerprints and/or iris.\n\nHowever, the Aadhaar Act and Regulations provides that an\n\nAadhaar number holder cannot be denied service due to the\n\nfailure of Aadhaar authentication. Hence, all Aadhaar\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 74 of 567\n\napplications must implement exception processes. Possible\n\nmethods to implement the exception process include:\n\n(i) Family Based Authentication: Family based applications\n\nsuch as PDS or Health applications may allow authentication by\n\nfamily members to allow resident to avail services.\n\n(ii) Alternate Modalities: Some applications may use different\n\nmodalities for exception handling. Alternate modalities include:\n\n(a) Iris Authentication\n\n(b) OTP Authentication (if allowed by policy)\n\n(iii) Biometric Fusion: UIDAI is introducing face authentication\n\nas secondary authentication factor to reduce the rate of\n\nauthentication failures, especially for senior citizens. At this time,\n\nface authentication will be used only conjunction with another\n\nauthentication factor such as finger/iris/OTP.\n\n(a) Face + Finger Fusion\n\n(b) Face + Iris Fusion\n\n(c) Face + OTP Fusion\n\n(iv) Non Aadhaar Based Exception process: Applications may\n\nimplement non-Aadhaar based exception process to ensure that\n\nno resident is denied service. Applications need to monitor the\n\nuse of exceptions in their applications to prevent misuse of the\n\nexception process.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 75 of 567\n\n(v) Accordingly, DBT Mission Cabinet Secretariat had issued a\n\ndetailed circular dated December 19, 2017 regarding use of\n\nAadhaar in benefit schemes of Government – exception handling.\n\n(5) Please confirm that with respect to individuals under 15\n\nyears and over 60 years of age, biometric authentication is likely\n\nto fail due to changes in/fading of biometrics such as fingerprints.\n\nAns.: Though there is no conclusive evidence to say that\n\nbiometric authentication success is dependent upon age, slightly\n\nhigher authentication failure rates have been observed only for\n\nfingerprints for senior citizens above the age of 70. A number of\n\nexception processes are provided in answer to Question 4(b)\n\nabove to prevent denial of service for failure of authentication.\n\nFurther, in case of any issue in biometric authentication, an\n\nAadhaar number holder may update his/her biometric at any of\n\nthe Aadhaar enrolment centres, which is also provided for in the\n\nAadhaar Act.\n\n(6) Please confirm that the reasons why over 49000 enrolment\n\noperators were blacklisted include: (i) failure to verify documents\n\npresented; (ii) failure to maintain records of documents submitted;\n\n(iii) misuse of information submitted; and (iv) aiding or abetting\n\nfalse enrolments?\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 76 of 567\n\nAns.: UIDAI has a policy to enforce the process guidelines and\n\ndata quality check during the enrolment process. 100% of the\n\nenrolments done by operators undergoes a quality assurance\n\ncheck. If any Aadhaar enrolment is found to be not as per the\n\nUIDAI process, the enrolment itself gets rejected and Aadhaar is\n\nnot generated. If such mistake by an operator crosses a\n\nthreshold defined in the policy, the operator is blacklisted/\n\nremoved from the UIDAI ecosystem. As such, of the 49,000\n\noperators who have been blacklisted/removed from the UIDAI\n\neco-system, all the enrolments which were in violation of the\n\nprocess were rejected in the QA stage. Enrolment operators may\n\nbe blacklisted for the following reasons:\n\n illegally charging the resident for Aadhaar enrolment\n\n poor demographic data quality\n\n invalid biometric exceptions\n\n other process malpractice\n\n(7) Please confirm:\n\n(a) At the stage of enrolment, there is no verification as to\n\nwhether a person is an illegal immigrant.\n\n(b) At the stage of enrolment, there is no verification about a\n\nperson being resident in India for 182 days or more in the past 12\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 77 of 567\n\nmonths.\n\n(c) Foreign nationals may enrol and are issued Aadhaar\n\nnumbers.\n\n(d) Persons retain their Aadhaar number even after they cease\n\nto be resident. This is true of foreign nationals as well.\n\nAns.:\n\n(a) At the time of enrolment, verification is done based upon\n\ndocuments provided by the resident. In case any violation of\n\nprescribed guidelines comes to light, the concerned Aadhaar is\n\nomitted/deactivated.\n\n(b) This has been included through the enrolment form where\n\nresident undertakes and signs the disclosure:\n\n“Disclosure under\nSection 3(2)\nof the Aadhaar (Targeted\nDelivery of Financial And Other Subsidies, Benefits and\nServices) Act, 2016\n\nI confirm that I have been residing in India for at least 182\ndays in the preceding 12 months & information (including\nbiometrics) provided by me to the UIDAI is my own and is\ntrue, correct and accurate. I am aware that my information\n(including biometrics) will be used for generation of\nAadhaar and authentication. I understand that my identity\ninformation (except core biometric) may be provided to an\nagency only with my consent during authentication or as\nper the provisions of the Aadhaar Act. I have a right to\naccess my identity information (except core biometrics)\nfollowing the procedure\nlaid down by\nUIDAI.”\n\n(c) Aadhaar is issued to the resident of India and the word\n\n‘resident’ is defined in Section 2(v) of the Aadhaar Act. Aadhaar\n\nnumbers may be issued to foreign nationals who are resident in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 78 of 567\n\nIndia.\nSection 2(v)\nreads as under:\n\n“ ‘resident’ means an individual who has resided in India for\na period or periods amounting in all to one hundred and\neighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately\npreceding the date of application for enrolment;”\n\nA foreign national fulfilling the above criteria is eligible for\n\nAadhaar, provided he submits the acceptable POI/POA document\n\nas per the UIDAI valid list of documents.\n\n(d) As per the Aadhaar Act, an Aadhaar number is issued to a\n\nresident who has been residing in India for at least 182 days in\n\nthe preceding 12 months. An Aadhaar number is issued to an\n\nindividual for life and may be omitted/deactivated in case of\n\nviolation of prescribed guidelines only. Ineligibility of a person to\n\nretain an Aadhaar number owing to become non-resident may be\n\ntreated as a ground for deactivation of Aadhaar number and\n\nRegulation 28(l)(f)\nof the Aadhaar Enrolment Regulations. This is\n\nin keeping with\nSection 31(1)\nand (3) of the Aadhaar Act wherein\n\nit is an obligation on an Aadhaar number holder to inform the\n\nUIDAI of changes in demographic information and for the\n\nAuthority to make the necessary alteration.\n\n(8) Please confirm the Points Of Service (POS) biometric\n\nreaders are capable of storing biometric information.\n\nAns.: UIDAI has mandated use of Registered Devices (RD) for\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 79 of 567\n\nall authentication requests. With RDs, biometric data is signed\n\nwithin the device/RD service using the provider key to ensure it is\n\nindeed captured live. The device provider RD service encrypts\n\nthe PID block before returning to the host application. This RD\n\nservice encapsulates the biometric capture, signing and\n\nencryption of biometrics all within it. Therefore, introduction of\n\nRD in Aadhaar authentication system rules out any possibility of\n\nuse of stored biometric and replay of biometrics captured from\n\nother source. Requesting entities are not legally allowed to store\n\nbiometrics captured for Aadhaar authentication under\nRegulation\n\n17(1)(a)\nof the Authentication Regulations.\n\n(9) Referring to slide/page 13, please confirm that the\n\narchitecture under the Aadhaar Act includes: (i) authentication\n\nuser agencies (e.g. Kerala Dairy Farmers Welfare Fund Board);\n\n(ii) authentication service agencies (e.g. Airtel); and (iii) CIDR.\n\nAns.: UIDAI appoints Requesting Entities (AUA/KUA) and\n\nAuthentication Service Agency (ASA) as per\nRegulation 12\nof\n\nAuthentication Regulations. List of Requesting Entitles\n\n(AUA/KUA) and Authentication Service Agency appointed by\n\nUIDAI is available on UIDAI’s website. An AUA/KUA can do\n\nauthentication on behalf of other entities under\nRegulation 15\nand\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 80 of 567\n\nRegulation 16\n.\n\n(10) Please confirm that one or more entitles in the Aadhaar\n\narchitecture described in the previous paragraph record the date\n\nand time of the authentication, the client IP, the device ID and\n\npurpose of authentication.\n\nAns.: UIDAI does not ask requesting entities to maintain any logs\n\nrelated to IP address of the device, GPS coordinates of the\n\ndevice and purpose of authentication. However, AUAs like banks,\n\ntelecom etc., in order to ensure that their systems are secure,\n\nfrauds are managed, they may store additional information as per\n\ntheir requirement under their respective laws to secure their\n\nsystem. Section 32(3) of the Aadhaar Act specifically prevents\n\nthe UIDAI from either by itself or through any entity under its\n\ncontrol to keep or maintain any information about the purpose of\n\nauthentication.\n\nRequesting entities are mandated to maintain following logs\n\nas per\nRegulation 18\nof the Authentication Regulations. These\n\nare:\n\n(i) the Aadhaar number against which authentication is\n\nsought;\n\n(ii) specified parameters of authentication request\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 81 of 567\n\nsubmitted;\n\n(iii) specified parameters received as authentication\n\nresponse;\n\n(iv) the record of disclosure of information to the Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder at the time of authentication; and\n\n(v) record of consent of the Aadhaar number holder for\n\nauthentication, but shall not, in any event, retain the PID\n\ninformation.\n\nFurther, even if a requesting entity captures any other data\n\nas per their own requirement, UIDAI will only audit the\n\nauthentication logs maintained by the requesting entity as per\n\nRegulation 18(1)\nof the Authentication Regulations.\n\nASAs are not permitted to maintain any logs related to IP\n\naddress of the device, GPS coordinates of the device etc. ASAs\n\nare mandated to maintain logs as per\nRegulation 20\nof the\n\nAuthentication Regulations:\n\n(i) identity of the requesting entity;\n\n(ii) parameters of authentication request submitted; and\n\n(iii) parameters received as authentication response.\n\nProvided that no Aadhaar number, PID information, device\n\nidentity related data and e-KYC response data, where applicable,\n\nshall be retained.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 82 of 567\n\n(11) Referring to slide/page 7 and 14, please confirm that\n\n‘traceability’ features enable UIDAI to track the specific device\n\nand its location from where each and every authentication takes\n\nplace.\n\nAns.: UIDAI gets the AUA code, ASA code, unique device code,\n\nregistered device code used for authentication. UIDAI does not\n\nget any information related to the IP address or the GPS location\n\nfrom where authentication is performed as these parameters are\n\nnot part of authentication (v2.0) and e-KYC (v2.1) API UIDAI\n\nwould only know from which device the authentication has\n\nhappened, through which AUA/ASA etc. This is what the slides\n\nmeant by traceability. UIDAI does not receive any information\n\nabout at what location the authentication device is deployed, its\n\nIP address and its operator and the purpose of authentication.\n\nFurther, the UIDAI or any entity under its control is statutorily\n\nbarred from collecting, keeping or maintaining any information\n\nabout the purpose of authentication under Section 32(3) of the\n\nAadhaar Act.\n\nSumming up the Scheme:\n\n55) The whole architecture of Aadhaar is devised to give unique\n\nidentity to the citizens of this country. No doubt, a person can\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 83 of 567\n\nhave various documents on the basis of which that individual can\n\nestablish her identify. It may be in the form of a passport,\n\nPermanent Account Number (PAN) card, ration card and so on.\n\nFor the purpose of enrolment itself number of documents are\n\nprescribed which an individual can produce on the basis of which\n\nAadhaar card can be issued. Thus, such documents, in a way,\n\nare also proof of identity. However, there is a fundamental\n\ndifference between the Aadhaar card as a mean of identity and\n\nother documents through which identity can be established.\n\nEnrolment for Aadhaar card also requires giving of demographic\n\ninformation as well as biometric information which is in the form\n\nof iris and fingerprints. This process eliminates any chance of\n\nduplication. It is emphasised that an individual can manipulate\n\nthe system by having more than one or even number of PAN\n\ncards, passports, ration cards etc. When it comes to obtaining\n\nAadhaar card, there is no possibility of obtaining duplicate card.\n\nOnce the biometric information is stored and on that basis\n\nAadhaar card is issued, it remains in the system with the\n\nAuthority. Wherever there would be a second attempt for\n\nenrolling for Aadhaar and for this purpose same person gives his\n\nbiometric information, it would immediately get matched with the\n\nsame biometric information already in the system and the second\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 84 of 567\n\nrequest would stand rejected. It is for this reason the Aadhaar\n\ncard is known as Unique Identification (UID). Such an identity is\n\nunparalleled.\n\n56) There is, then, another purpose for having such a system of\n\nissuing unique identification cards in the form of Aadhaar card. A\n\nglimpse thereof is captured under the heading ‘Introduction’\n\nabove while mentioning how and under what circumstances the\n\nwhole project was conceptualised. To put it tersely, in addition to\n\nenabling any resident to obtain such unique identification proof, it\n\nis also to empower marginalised section of the society,\n\nparticularly those who are illiterate and living in abject poverty or\n\nwithout any shelter etc. It gives identity to such persons also.\n\nMoreover, with the aid of Aadhaar card, they can claim various\n\nprivileges and benefits etc. which are actually meant for these\n\npeople.\n\nIdentity of a person has a significance for every individual in\n\nhis/her life. In a civilised society every individual, on taking birth,\n\nis given a name. Her place of birth and parentage also becomes\n\nimportant as she is known in the society and these demographic\n\nparticulars also become important attribute of her personality.\n\nThroughout their lives, individuals are supposed to provide such\n\ninformation: be it admission in a school or college or at the time of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 85 of 567\n\ntaking job or engaging in any profession or business activity, etc.\n\nWhen all this information is available in one place, in the form of\n\nAadhaar card, it not only becomes unique, it would also qualify as\n\na document of empowerment. Added with this feature, when an\n\nindividual knows that no other person can clone her, it assumes\n\ngreater significance.\n\n57) Thus, the scheme by itself can be treated as laudable when it\n\ncomes to enabling an individual to seek Aadhaar number, more\n\nso, when it is voluntary in nature. Howsoever benevolent the\n\nscheme may be, it has to pass the muster of constitutionality.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, the very architecture of Aadhaar is\n\nunconstitutional on various grounds, glimpse whereof can be\n\nprovided at this stage:\n\nGist of the challenge to the Aadhaar Scheme as well as the Act:\n\n58) The petitioners accept that the case at hand is unique, simply\n\nbecause of the reason that the programme challenged here is\n\nitself without precedent. According to them, no democratic\n\nsociety has adopted a programme that is similar in its command\n\nand sweep. The case is about a new technology that the\n\nGovernment seeks to deploy and a new architecture of\n\ngovernance that it seeks to build on this technology. The\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 86 of 567\n\npetitioners are discrediting the Government’s claim that biometric\n\ntechnology employed and the Aadhaar Act is greatly beneficial.\n\nAs per the petitioners, this is an inroad into the rights and liberties\n\nof the citizens which the Constitution of India guarantees. It is\n\nintrusive in nature. At its core, Aadhaar alters the relationship\n\nbetween the citizen and the State. It diminishes the status of the\n\ncitizens. Rights freely exercised, liberties freely enjoyed,\n\nentitlements granted by the Constitution and laws are all made\n\nconditional, on a compulsory barter. The barter compels the\n\ncitizens to give up their biometrics ‘voluntarily’, allow their\n\nbiometrics and demographic information to be stored by the State\n\nand private operators and then used for a process termed\n\n‘authentication’. According to them, by the very scheme of the\n\nAct and the way it operates, it has propensity to cause ‘civil\n\ndeath’ of an individual by simply switching of Aadhaar of that\n\nperson. It is the submission of the petitioners that the\n\nConstitution balances rights of individuals against State interest.\n\nThe Aadhaar completely upsets this balance and skews the\n\nrelationship between the citizen and the State enabling the State\n\nto totally dominate the individual.\n\n59) The challenge is directed at the constitutional validity of the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 87 of 567\n\nfollowing facets of Aadhaar:\n\n(i) The Aadhaar programme that operated between January\n\n28, 2009 until the bringing into force of the Aadhaar Act on\n\nJuly 12, 2016.\n\n(ii) The Aadhaar Act (and alternatively certain provisions of\n\nthat Act).\n\n(iii) Elements of the Aadhaar project or programme that\n\ncontinues to operate, though not within the cover of the\n\nAadhaar Act.\n\n(iv) Specific Regulations framed under the Aadhaar Act,\n\nillustratively the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations,\n\n2016.\n\n(v) A set of subordinate legislation in the form of statutory\n\nrules/regulations including the Money Laundering\n\n(Amendment) Rules, 2017.\n\n(vi) All notifications (nearly 139) issued under Section 7 of the\n\nAadhaar Act (assuming the Act is upheld) insofar as they\n\nmake Aadhaar mandatory for availing certain\n\nbenefits/services/subsidies, including PDS, MGNREGA\n\nand social security pension.\n\n(vii) Actions on the part of the authorities to make Aadhaar\n\nmandatory even where not covered by\nSection 7\n, inter\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 88 of 567\n\nalia: Actions by CBSE, NEET, JEE and UGC requirements\n\nfor scholarship.\n\n(viii) Specifically, actions on part of the Government mandating\n\nlinking of mobile phones and Aadhaar vide DoT circular\n\ndated March 23, 2017.\n\n(ix)\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 insofar as it\n\nviolates\nArticle 21\nby mandating linking Aadhaar to PAN\n\nand requiring Aadhaar linkage for filing returns.\n\n60) Apart from the declaratory reliefs regarding ultra vires and\n\ncertiorari to quash the provisions/actions enumerated above,\n\nthere are certain other reliefs that are also sought, including:\n\n(i) Suitable declarations regarding the physical autonomy of a\n\nperson over her own body qua the Indian State.\n\n(ii) Mandatory directions requiring the respondents to give an\n\noption to persons who are enrolled with the Aadhaar\n\nprogramme to opt out and to delete the data with suitable\n\ncertification for compliance.\n\n(iii) Mandatory directions to all concerned authorities that\n\nshould the Aadhaar Act, etc. be upheld, nevertheless,\n\nevery person must be entitled to avail services, benefits\n\netc. through alternative means of identification.\n\nNegatively, nothing can be withheld from a citizen merely\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 89 of 567\n\nbecause he/she does not have an Aadhaar Card or does\n\nnot wish to use their Aadhaar Card.\n\n(iv) Mandatory directions consistent with the fundamental right\n\nto privacy and the right of a citizen to be let alone that no\n\nelectronic trial or record of his/her authentication be\n\nmaintained.\n\n61) On the aforesaid premise, the petitioners point out following\n\nheads of challenge:\n\nSurveillance:\n\n62) The project creates the architecture for pervasive surveillance\n\nand unless the project is stopped, it will lead to an Orwellian State\n\nwhere every move of the citizen is constantly tracked and\n\nrecorded by the State. The architecture of the project comprises\n\na Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR) which stores and\n\nmaintains authentication transaction data. The authentication\n\nrecord comprises the time of authentication and the identity of the\n\nrequesting entity. Based on this architecture it is possible for the\n\nState to track down the location of the person seeking\n\nauthentication. Since the requesting entity is also identified, the\n\nactivity that the citizen is engaging in is also known.\n\nViolation of Fundamental Right to Privacy:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 90 of 567\n\n63) The fundamental right to privacy is breached by the Aadhaar\n\nproject and the Aadhaar Act in numerous ways. Following are the\n\nillustrations given by the petitioners:\n\n(a) Between 2009-10 and July 2016 the project violated the\n\nright to privacy with respect to personal demographic as well as\n\nbiometric information collected, stored and shared as there was\n\nno law authorising these actions.\n\n(b) During both the pre-Act and post-Act periods, the project\n\ncontinues to violate the right to privacy by requiring individuals to\n\npart with demographic as well as biometric information to private\n\nenrolling agencies.\n\n(c) By enabling private entities to use the Aadhaar\n\nauthentication platform, the citizen’s right to informational privacy\n\nis violated inasmuch as the citizen is compelled to ‘report’ his/her\n\nactions to the State.\n\n(d) Even where a person is availing of a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice from the State, mandatory authentication through the\n\nAadhaar platform (without an option to the citizen to use an\n\nalternative mode of identification) violates the right to\n\ninformational privacy.\n\n(e) With Aadhaar being made compulsory for holding a bank\n\naccount, operating a cell phone, having a valid PAN, holding\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 91 of 567\n\nmutual funds, securing admission to school, taking a board\n\nexamination, etc. the citizen has no option but to obtain Aadhaar.\n\nCompelling the citizen to part with biometric information violates\n\nindividual autonomy and dignity.\n\n(f) In a digital society an individual has the right to protect\n\nhimself by controlling the dissemination of personal information,\n\nincluding biometric information. Compelling an individual to\n\nestablish his identity by planting her biometric at multiple points of\n\nservice violates privacy involving the person.\n\n(g) The seeding of Aadhaar in distinct databases enables the\n\ncontent of information about an individual that is stored in\n\ndifferent silos to be aggregated. This enables the State to build\n\ncomplete profiles of individuals violating privacy through the\n\nconvergence of data.\n\nLimited Government:\n\n64) A fundamental feature of the Constitution is the sovereignty of the\n\npeople with limited Government authority. The Constitution limits\n\ngovernmental authority in various ways, amongst them\n\nFundamental Rights, the distribution of powers amongst organs\n\nof the State and the ultimate check by way of judicial review. The\n\nAadhaar project is destructive of the limited Government. The\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 92 of 567\n\nConstitution is not about the power of the State, but about the\n\nlimits on the power of the State. Post Aadhaar, the State will\n\ncompletely dominate the citizen and alter the relationship\n\nbetween citizen and the State. The features of a totalitarian state\n\nis seen from:\n\n(a) A person cannot conduct routine activities such as operating\n\na bank account, holding an investment in mutual funds, receiving\n\ngovernment pension, receiving scholarship, receiving food\n\nrations, operating a mobile phone without the State knowing\n\nabout these activities.\n\n(b) The State can build a profile of the individual based on the\n\ntrial of authentication from which the nature of the citizen’s activity\n\ncan be determined.\n\n(c) By disabling Aadhaar the State can cause civil death of the\n\nperson.\n\n(d) By making Aadhaar compulsory for other activities such as\n\nair travel, rail travel, directorship in companies, services and\n\nbenefits extended by the State Governments and Municipal\n\nCorporations, etc. there will be virtually no zone of activity left\n\nwhere the citizen is not under the gaze of the State. This will\n\nhave a chilling effect on the citizen.\n\n(e) In such a society, there is little or no personal autonomy.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 93 of 567\n\nThe State is pervasive, and dignity of the individual stands\n\nextinguished.\n\n(f) This is an inversion of the accountability in the Right to\n\nInformation age: instead of the State being transparent to the\n\ncitizen, it is the citizen who is rendered transparent to the State.\n\nImpugned Act illegally passed as a ‘Money Bill’:\n\n65) The Bill No. 47 of 2016 introduced in the Lok Sabha and which\n\nupon passage became the impugned Act was not a Money Bill in\n\nterms of\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution of India. Even though the\n\nobject and purpose of the impugned legislation states that it is to\n\nbe used for the delivery of subsidies, benefits and services,\n\nexpenditure for which is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of\n\nIndia, the scope of the impugned Act is far beyond what is\n\nenvisaged under\nArticle 110.\nInasmuch as the impugned Act has\n\nnot followed the constitutional procedure mandated for the\n\npassage of a law by disguising the statute as a ‘Money Bill’, there\n\nis no valid legislative process that has been followed in this case.\n\nThe legislative process being colourable and since judicial review\n\nextends wherever Part III rights are violated, the Aadhaar Act is\n\nliable to be struck down.\n\nProcedure followed violates\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 94 of 567\n\n66) The procedure adopted by the respondents, both pre-Act and\n\npost-Act, is arbitrary and in violation of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution because:\n\n(a) There is no informed consent at the time of enrolment.\n\nIndividuals are not told about crucial aspects such as potential\n\nmisuse of the information, the commercial value of the\n\ninformation, the storage of information in a centralised database,\n\nthat the information supplied could be used against the individual\n\nin criminal proceedings pursuant to a court order, there is no opt-\n\nout option, the entire enrolment process is conducted by private\n\nentities without any governmental supervision, etc.\n\n(b) UIDAI has no direct relationship with the enrolling agency\n\nwhich collects sensitive personal information (biometric and\n\ndemographic).\n\n(c) The data collected and uploaded in to the CIDR is not\n\nverified by any Government official designated by the UIDAI. The\n\ndata collected and stored lacks integrity.\n\n(d) The procedure at the stage of enrolment and authentication\n\nenables the enrolling agency as well as the ‘requesting entity’ to\n\ncapture, store and misuse/use the biometric as well as\n\ndemographic information without the UIDAI having any control\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 95 of 567\n\nover such misuse/use.\n\nUnreliability of Biometrics and Exclusion:\n\n67) The foundation of the project, i.e. biometrics, is an unreliable and\n\nuntested technology. Moreover, biometric exceptions severely\n\nerode reliability. The biometric authentication system works on a\n\nprobabilistic model. Consequently, entitlements are reduced from\n\ncertainty to a chance delivery where the biometrics match.\n\nAcross the country several persons are losing out on their\n\nentitlements, for say food rations, because of a biometric\n\nmismatch resulting in them being excluded from various welfare\n\nschemes. The project is not an ‘identity’ project but an\n\n‘identification’ exercise. Unless the biometrics work, a person in\n\nflesh and blood, does not exist for the State.\n\nIllegal Object:\n\n68) It is submitted before us that the objective of creating a single\n\npervasive identification over time is itself illegal. There are\n\nseveral facets to the illegality and amongst them is the very\n\nnegation of an individual citizen’s freedom to identify through\n\ndifferent means. The coercive foundation of the impugned Act is\n\nin substance an illegal objective that renders the statute ultra\n\nvires\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 96 of 567\n\nDemocracy, Identity and Choice:\n\n69) A citizen or resident in a democratic society has a choice to\n\nidentify himself/herself through different modes in the course of\n\nhis/her interactions generally in society as well as his/her\n\ninteractions with the State. Mandating identification by only one\n\nhighly intrusive mode is excessive, disproportionate and violates\n\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21.\n\nChildren:\n\n70) As per the petitioners, there is no justification to include children\n\nin the Aadhaar programme for various reasons.\n\n71) It may also be recorded at this juncture itself that insofar as the\n\nAadhaar Act is concerned, following provisions thereof are\n\nspecifically attacked as unconstitutional:\n\n(i)\nSection 2(c)\nand\n2(d)\n- authentication and authentication\n\nrecord, read with\nSection 32\n\n(ii)\nSection 2(h)\nread with\nSection 10\nof CIDR\n\n(iii)\nSection 2(l)\nread with\nRegulation 23\nof the Aadhaar\n\n(Enrolment and Updates) Regulation - ‘enrolling agency’\n\n(iv)\nSection 2(v)\n- ‘resident’\n\n(v)\nSection 3\n– Aadhaar Number\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 97 of 567\n\n(vi)\nSection 5\n– Special treatment to children\n\n(vii)\nSection 6\n– Update of information\n\n(viii)\nSection 7\n\n(ix)\nSection 8\n\n(x)\nSection 9\n\n(xi) Chapter IV –\nSections 11\nto\n(xii)\nSections 23\nand\n– excessive delegation\n\n(xiii)\nSection 23(2)(g)\nread with Chapter VI & VII – Regulations\n\n27 to 32 of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations,\n(xiv)\nSection 29\n\n(xv)\nSection 33\n\n(xvi)\n\nSection 47\n\n(xvii)\n\nSection 48\n– Power of Central Government to supersede\n\nUIDAI\n\n(xviii)\nSection 57\n\n(xix)\n\nSection 59\n\nSome Introductory Remarks:\n\n72) Before proceeding further, it would be necessary to state here the\n\napproach which we have adopted in dealing with various issues\n\nthat are raised in these petitions. That may help in understanding\n\nthe manner in which the matter is dealt with. This necessitates\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 98 of 567\n\nsome introductory remarks:\n\n(i) We may remark at this stage itself that many of the heads of\n\nchallenge which are taken note of above are overlapping and,\n\ntherefore, discussion on one aspect may provide substantial\n\nanswers to the arguments advanced under the other head of\n\nchallenge as well. Our endeavour, therefore, would be to eschew\n\nthe repetitive discussion. However, our anxiety to bring clarity\n\nand also in order to have continuity of thought while discussing a\n\nparticular head, may have led to some repetitions at different\n\nplaces. In any case, we would be dealing with the various heads\n\nof challenge, one by one, so as to cover the entire spectrum.\n\n(ii) In order to have a smooth flow of discussion, we are going\n\nto formulate the questions which arise in all these petitions and\n\nthen decide those issues. Since, number of advocates 7 appeared\n\non both sides, many of the arguments addressed by them were\n\noverlapping and repetitive. In this scenario, we deem it proper to\n\ncollate the arguments of all the counsel and present the same\n\nwhile undertaking the discussion on each of the issues. Thus, in\n\nthe process, we would not be referring to each counsel and her\n\narguments. We may, however, intend to place on record that all\n\n7 S/Shri Kapil Sibal, Gopal Subramaniam, P.

We,\n\ntherefore, place on record our appreciation of the sublime nature\n\nof lawyering in this case.\n\n(iii) As pointed out above, many number of foreign judgments\n\nwere cited during arguments. The history of this Court reflects\n\nthat this Court has liberally accepted the good practices, rules of\n\ninterpretation and norms of constitutional courts of other\n\njurisdictions. In fact, in drafting Indian Constitution itself, the\n\nframing fathers had studied various foreign models and adopted\n\nprovisions from different Constitutions after deep reflection.\n\nConstitutional influences of system prevailing in some of the\n\ncountries on Indian Constitution can be summarised as under:\n\nFrom UK - Parliamentary Type of Government\n- Cabinet System of Ministers\n- Bicameral Parliament\n- Lower House more powerful\n- Council of Minsters responsible to Lower\nHouse\nFrom US - Written Constitution\n\n- Executive head of State known as President\nand his being the Supreme Commander of\nthe Armed Forces\n\n- Vice-President as the ex-officio Chairman of\nRajya Sabha\n\n- Bill of Rights\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 100 of 567\n\n- Supreme Court\n\n- Provision of States\n\n- Independence of Judiciary and judicial\nreview\n\n- Preamble\n\n- Removal of Supreme Court and High Court\nJudges\nFrom USSR - Fundamental Duties\n\n- Five Year Plan\nFrom Australia - Concurrent List\n\n- Language of the preamble\n\n- Provision regarding trade, commerce and\nintercourse\nFrom Japan - Law on which the Supreme Court function\nFrom Weimar - Suspension of Fundamental Rights during\nConstitution of the emergency\nGermany\nFrom Canada - Scheme of federation with a strong centre\n\n- Distribution of powers between the centre\nand the states and placing residuary powers\nwith the centre\nFrom Ireland - Concept of Directive Principles of States\nPolicy\n\n- Method of election of President\n\n- Nomination of members in the Rajya Sabha\nby the President\n\nIt was, therefore, but natural to find out the manner in which\n\nparticular provisions have been interpreted by the constitutional\n\ncourts of the aforesaid countries. Case law of this Court would\n\nreflect this for interpreting the provisions relating to ‘Inter-State\n\nTrade, Commerce & Intercourse’. The case law of the Australian\n\nHigh Court is liberally referred as this Chapter is influenced by the\n\nprovisions contained in the Australian Constitution. Likewise, for\n\ninterpreting provisions of Part IX of the Constitution on ‘Relations\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 101 of 567\n\nbetween the Union and the States’ where Canadian model is\n\nfollowed, the judgments of Canadian Supreme Court have been\n\ncited by this Court from time to time. Influence of U.S.\n\nConstitutionalism, tempered by the wish to preserve India’s own\n\ncharacteristics, while interpreting chapter relating to fundamental\n\nrights as well as power of judicial review is also discernible. A\n\ncritical analysis of the various judgments of this Court, where\n\nforeign precedents are cited8, formulates four typologies of use,\n\nnamely:\n\n(a) Where the court relies on foreign precedents for guidance\n\non general constitutional principles and when necessary to;\n\n(b) Where the court frames the issue posed for adjudication\n\nand/or to formulate evaluative test and frameworks;\n\n(c) To distinguish the country’s context from the foreign one 9;\n\n(d) To ‘read’ in the Constitution implied or unenumerated\n\nrights10.\n\nIt can be said that though this Court has been liberally\n\nrelying upon the judgments of the constitutional courts of other\n\ncountries, particularly when it comes to human rights discourse,\n\nat the same time, in certain situations, note of caution is also\n\n8 Thiruvengadam, The Use of Foreign Law in Constitutional Cases in\nIndia and Singapore (2010)\n9 Basheshar Nath v.

State of Madras, 1950 SCR 594\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 102 of 567\n\nadded to give a message that the judgment of other jurisdiction\n\ncannot be relied blindly and it would depend as to whether a\n\nparticular judgment will fit in Indian context or not. As a matter of\n\nfact, in Basheshar Nath, the Court discussed the doctrine of\n\nwaiver in force in the United States and rejected it firmly stating\n\nthat:\n\n:...the doctrine of waiver enunciated by some American\nJudges in construing the American Constitution cannot be\nintroduced in our Constitution...We are not for the moment\nconvinced that this theory has any relevancy in construing\nthe fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the\nConstitution.”\n\nOn the contrary, in Romesh Thappar, the Court completely\n\nbased its decision to strike down a law restricting the free\n\ncirculation of newspapers on two US precedents, Ex parte\n\nJackson11 and Lovell v. City of Griffin12, and affirmed that the\n\nprotection of freedom of expression in India follows the maxim of\n\nMadison that the Court transposed from its quotation in Near v.\n\nMinnesota13, according to which ‘it is better to leave a few of its\n\nnoxious branches to their luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them\n\naway, to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper fruits’.\n\nLikewise, the role of foreign precedents in a majority opinion is\n\nconfirmed in the decision of His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati\n\n11 Ex Parte Jackson, 96 US 727 (1878).\n\n12 Lovell v.

At the same time, looking to the use of foreign\n\nprecedents in this judgment, Justice S.M. Sikri (as His Lordship\n\nthen was), dealing with the interpretation of\nArticle 368\nof the\n\nConstitution, first of all, highlighted that:\n\n“No other Constitution in the world is like ours. No other\nConstitution combines under its wings such diverse\npeoples, numbering now more than 550 millions [sic], with\ndifferent languages and religions and in different stages of\neconomic development, into one nation, and no other\nnation is faced with such vast socio-economic problems.\n\nAfter this premise, however, His Lordship accepts, in order\n\nto define what an ‘amendment’ is according to the Indian\n\nConstitution, the reasoning of Lord Greene in Bidie v. General\n\nAccident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation 14 and that of\n\nJustice Holmes in Towne v. Eisner15, which affirm that to\n\nunderstand a word it is necessary to understand the context in\n\nwhich it is inserted. To strengthen this, James v. Commonwealth\n\nof Australia16 is also referred to.\n\nWe have stated the trend in brief with a purpose. Number\n\nof judgments of U.K. Courts, German Supreme Court, European\n\nCommission of Human Rights (ECHR), U.S. Supreme Court etc.\n\nwere cited. However, there is no similarity in approach by these\n\n14 Bidie v. General Accident, Fire and Life Assurance Corporation (1948) 2 All ER 995, 998.\n15 Towne v. Eisner, 245 US 418.\n\n16 James v. Commonwealth of Australia, (1936) AC 578.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 104 of 567\n\nCourts in deciding a particular issue by applying different\n\nprinciples, particularly when it comes to the issues of data\n\nprotection and privacy. In this backdrop, it becomes necessary,\n\nwhile referring to these judgments, to keep in mind the ethos,\n\ncultural background and vast socio-economic problems of this\n\ncountry and on that basis to accept a particular norm, or for that\n\nmatter, to formulate a constitutional norm which is relevant in our\n\ncontext. That is the endeavour which is made by us.\n\n(iv) Many arguments of the petitioners relate to the working of\n\nthe system. The petitioners had argued that the architecture of\n\nAadhaar, by its very nature, is probabilistic and, therefore, it may\n\nresult in exclusion, in many cases. Therefore, rather than\n\nextending subsidies, benefits and services to the section of\n\nsociety for which these are meant, it may have the tendency to\n\nexclude them from receiving such subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices. The respondents, on the other hand, have stated on\n\naffidavit that the attempt of the respondents would be to ensure\n\nthat no individual who is eligible for such benefits etc. is deprived\n\nform receiving those benefits, even when in a particular case, it is\n\nfound that on authentication, his fingerprints or iris are not\n\nmatching and is resulting into failure. It was clarified that since\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 105 of 567\n\nAadhaar project is an ongoing project, there may be some\n\nglitches in its working and there is a continuous attempt to make\n\nimprovements in order to ensure that it becomes foolproof over a\n\nperiod of time. We have eschewed detailed discussion in respect\n\nof those arguments, which may not have much relevance when\n\njudging the constitutional validity of the Act and the scheme.\n\nHowever, such arguments of exclusion etc. leading to violation of\n\nArticles 14\nand\nare dealt with at an appropriate stage. But the\n\nargument based on alleged inaccurate claims of savings by the\n\nAuthority/Union of India in respect of certain programmes, like\n\nsaving of USD 11 billion per annum due to the Aadhaar project,\n\nas well as savings in the implementation of the MGNREGA\n\nscheme, LPG subsidy, PDS savings need not detain us for long.\n\nSuch rebuttals raised by the petitioners may have relevance\n\ninsofar as working of the Act is concerned. That by itself cannot\n\nbe a ground to invalidate the statute.\n\n(v) As mentioned above, notwithstanding the passions and\n\nemotions evoked on both sides in equal measure, this Court has\n\nadopted a lambent approach while dealing with the issues raised,\n\nhaving a posture of calmness coupled with objective examination\n\nof the issues on the touchstone of the constitutional provisions.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 106 of 567\n\nWe are in the age of constitutional democracy, that too\n\nsubstantive and liberal democracy. Such a democracy is not\n\nbased solely on the rule of people through their representatives\n\nwhich is known as “formal democracy”. It also has other precepts\n\nlike rule of law, human rights, independence of judiciary,\n\nseparation of powers, etc. The framers of Indian Constitution\n\nduly recognized the aforesaid precepts of liberal and substantive\n\ndemocracy with rule of law as an important and fundamental\n\npillar. At the same time, in the scheme of the Constitution, it is\n\nthe judiciary which is assigned the role of upholding rule of law\n\nand protecting the Constitution and democracy.\n\nThe essence of rule of law is to preclude arbitrary action.\n\nDicey, who propounded the rule of law, gave distinct meaning to\n\nthis concept and explained that it was based on three kindered\n\nfeatures, which are as follows:\n\n(i) absence of arbitrary powers on the part of authorities;\n\n(ii) equality before law; and\n\n(iii) the Constitution is part of the ordinary law of the land.\n\nThere are three aspects of the rule of law, which are as\n\nfollows:\n\n(a) A formal aspect which means making the law rule.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 107 of 567\n\n(b) A jurisprudential or doctrinal aspect which is concerned with\n\nthe minimal condition for the existence of law in society.\n\n(c) A substantive aspect as per which the rule of law is\n\nconcerned with properly balancing between the individual and\n\nsociety.\n\nWhen we talk of jurisprudential rule of law, it includes\n\ncertain minimum requirements without which a legal system\n\ncannot exist and which distinguished a legal system from an\n\nautomatic system where the leader imposes his will on everyone\n\nelse. Professor Lon Fuller has described these requirements\n\ncollectively as the 'inner morality of law'. In addition to\n\njurisprudential concept, which is important and an essential\n\ncondition for the rule of law, the substantive concept of the rule of\n\nlaw is equally important and inseparable norm of the rule of law in\n\nreal sense. It encompasses the 'right conception' of the rule of\n\nlaw propounded by Dworkin. It means guaranteeing fundamental\n\nvalues of morality, justice, and human rights, with a proper\n\nbalance between these and the other needs of the society.\n\nJustice Aharon Barak, former Chief Justice of Israel, has lucidly\n\nexplained this facet of rule of law in the following manner:\n\n“The rule of law is not merely public order, the rule of law is\nsocial justice based on public order. The law exists to\nensure proper social life. Social life, however, is not a goal\nin itself but a means to allow the individual to live in dignity\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 108 of 567\n\nand develop himself. The human being and human rights\nunderlie this substantive perception of the rule of law, with\na proper balance among the different rights and between\nhuman rights and the proper needs of society. The\nsubstantive rule of law “is the rule of proper law, which\nbalances the needs of society and the individual”. This is\nthe rule of law that strikes a balance between society's\nneed for political independence, social equality, economic\ndevelopment, and internal order, on the one hand, and the\nneeds of the individual, his personal liberty, and his human\ndignity on the other. The Judge must protect this rich\nconcept of the rule of law.”\n\nThe 'rule of law', which is a fine sonorous phrase, is\n\ndynamic and ever expanding and can be put alongside the\n\nbrotherhood of man, human rights and human dignity. About the\n\nmodern rule of law, Professor Garner observed:\n\n“The concept in its modern dress meets a need that has\nbeen felt throughout the history of civilization, law is not\nsufficient in itself and it must serve some purpose. Man is\na social animal, but to live in society he has had to fashion\nfor himself and in his own interest the law and other\ninstruments of government, and as a consequence those\nmust to some extent limit his personal liberties. The\nproblem is how to control those instruments of government\nin accordance with the Rule of Law and in the interest of\nthe governed.”\n\nLikewise, the basic spirit of our Constitution is to provide\n\neach and every person of the nation equal opportunity to grow as\n\na human being, irrespective of race, caste, religion, community\n\nand social status. Granville Austin while analyzing the functioning\n\nof Indian Constitution in first 50 years has described three\n\ndistinguished strands of Indian Constitution: (i) protecting national\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 109 of 567\n\nunity and integrity, (ii) establishing the institution and spirit of\n\ndemocracy; and (iii) fostering social reforms. The strands are\n\nmutually dependent and inextricably intertwined in what he\n\nelegantly describes as a 'seamless web'. And there cannot be\n\nsocial reforms till it is ensured that each and every citizen of this\n\ncountry is able to exploit his/her potentials to the maximum. The\n\nConstitution, although drafted by the Constituent Assembly, was\n\nmeant for the people of India and that is why it is given by the\n\npeople to themselves as expressed in the opening words “We the\n\nPeople...”. What is the most important gift to the common person\n\ngiven by this Constitution is “fundamental rights” which may be\n\ncalled human rights as well.\n\nSpeaking for the vision of our founding fathers, in\nState of\n\nKarnataka & Anr. v. Shri Ranganatha Reddy & Anr.\n17, this Court\n\nspeaking through Justice Krishna Iyer observed:\n\n“The social philosophy of the Constitution shapes creative\njudicial vision and orientation. Our nation has, as its\ndynamic doctrine, economic democracy sans which\npolitical democracy is chimerical. We say so because our\nConstitution, in Parts III and IV and elsewhere, ensouls\nsuch a value system, and the debate in this case puts\nprecisely this soul in peril….Our thesis is that the dialectics\nof social justice should not be missed if the synthesis of\nParts III and Part IV is to influence State action and court\npronouncements. Constitutional problems cannot be\nstudied in a socio-economic vacuum, since socio-cultural\nchanges are the source of the new values, and sloughing\noff old legal thought is part of the process the new equity-\n\n17 (1977) 4 SCC 471\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 110 of 567\n\nloaded legality. A judge is a social scientist in his role as\nconstitutional invigilator and fails functionally if he forgets\nthis dimension in his complex duties.”\n\nIn\nDattatraya Govind Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra18\nthe\n\nspirit of our Constitution was explained thus:\n\n“Our Constitution is a tryst with destiny, preamble with\nlucent solemnity in the words ‘Justice – social, economic\nand political.’ The three great branches of Government, as\ncreatures of the Constitution, must remember this promise\nin their fundamental role and forget it at their peril, for to do\nso will be a betrayal of chose high values and goals which\nthis nation set for itself in its objective Resolution and\nwhose elaborate summation appears in Part IV of the\nParamount Parchment. The history of our country’s\nstruggle for independence was the story of a battle\nbetween the forces of socio-economic exploitation and the\nmasses of deprived people of varying degrees and the\nConstitution sets the new sights of the nation…..Once we\ngrasp the dharma of the Constitution, the new orientation of\nthe karma of adjudication becomes clear. Our founding\nfathers, aware of our social realities, forged our fighting\nfaith and integrating justice in its social, economic and\npolitical aspects. While contemplating the meaning of the\nArticles of the Organic Law, the Supreme Court shall not\ndisown Social Justice.”\n\nIn\nNational Human Rights Commission v. State of\n\nArunachal Pradesh19\n, the Supreme Court explained it again, as\n\nunder:\n\n“We are a country governed by the Rule of Law. Our\nConstitution confers certain rights on every human being\nand certain other rights on citizens. Every person is entitled\nto equality before the law and equal protection of the laws.”\n\nLooking the matter from this angle, when the judiciary is\n\nassigned the role of upholding the rule of law, the first function of\n\n18 (1977) 2 SCC 548\n19 (1996) 1 SCC 742\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 111 of 567\n\nthe judiciary is to protect the democracy as well as the\n\nConstitution. At the same time, second role of the Court, which is\n\nequally important, is to bridge the gap between the law and the\n\nsociety. In the process of undertaking this role, a third role, which\n\nis of equal significance also springs up. Judiciary is also to\n\nensure that social and economic justice is meted out to the\n\ndeserving lot by affirmative action of the State. Our attempt has\n\nbeen to strive the balancing of competing Constitutional norms.\n\nThe complex issues are dealt with keeping in view this role of the\n\nSupreme Court as assigned by the Constitution; albeit within the\n\nconstitutional norms.\n\nScope of Judicial Review:\n\n73) The aforesaid discussion leads us to pick up and discuss another\n\nstrand viz. the scope of judicial review in such matters.\n\n74) Judicial review means the Supremacy of law. It is the power of\n\nthe court to review the actions of the Legislature, the Executive\n\nand the Judiciary itself and to scrutinize the validity of any law or\n\naction. It has emerged as one of the most effective instruments of\n\nprotecting and preserving the cherished freedoms in a\n\nconstitutional democracy and upholding principles such as\n\nseparation of powers and rule of law. The Judiciary, through\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 112 of 567\n\njudicial review, prevents the decisions of other branches from\n\nimpinging on the constitutional values. The fundamental nature\n\nof the Constitution is that of a limiting document, it curtails the\n\npowers of majoritarianism from hijacking the State. The power of\n\nreview is the shield which is placed in the hands of the most\n\njudiciaries of constitutional democracies to enable the protection\n\nof the supreme document.\n\n75) In\nBinoy Viswam v. Union of India & Ors.20\n, scope of judicial\n\nreview of legislative Act was described in the following manner:\n\n“76. Under the Constitution, Supreme Court as well as High\nCourts are vested with the power of judicial review of not\nonly administrative acts of the executive but legislative\nenactments passed by the legislature as well. This power is\ngiven to the High Courts under\nArticle 226\nof the\nConstitution and to the Supreme Court under\nArticle 32\nas\nwell as\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution. At the same time, the\nparameters on which the power of judicial review of\nadministrative act is to be undertaken are different from the\nparameters on which validity of legislative enactment is to\nbe examined. No doubt, in exercises of its power of judicial\nreview of legislative action, the Supreme Court, or for that\nmatter, the High Courts can declare law passed by\nParliament or the State Legislature as invalid. However, the\npower to strike down primary legislation enacted by the\nUnion or the State Legislatures is on limited grounds.\nCourts can strike down legislation either on the basis that it\nfalls foul of federal distribution of powers or that it\ncontravenes fundamental rights or other constitutional\nrights/provisions of the Constitution of India. No doubt,\nsince the Supreme Court and the High Courts are treated\nas the ultimate arbiter in all matters involving interpretation\nof the Constitution, it is the courts which have the final say\non questions relating to rights and whether such a right is\nviolated or not. The basis of the aforesaid statement lies in\n\n20 (2017) 7 SCC 59\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 113 of 567\n\nArticle 13(2)\nof the Constitution which proscribes the State\nfrom making “any law which takes away or abridges the\nright conferred by Part III”, enshrining fundamental rights. It\ncategorically states that any law made in contravention\nthereof, to the extent of the contravention, be void.\n\n77. We can also take note of\nArticle 372\nof the Constitution\nat this stage which applies to pre-constitutional laws.\nArticle\n372(1)\nreads as under:\n\n“372. Continuance in force of existing laws and\ntheir adaptation.—(1) Notwithstanding the repeal by\nthis Constitution of the enactments referred to in\n\nArticle 395\nbut subject to the other provisions of this\nConstitution, all the laws in force in the territory of\nIndia immediately before the commencement of this\nConstitution shall continue in force therein until\naltered or repealed or amended by a competent\nlegislature or other competent authority.”\n\nIn the context of judicial review of legislation, this provision\ngives an indication that all laws enforced prior to the\ncommencement of the Constitution can be tested for\ncompliance with the provisions of the Constitution by\ncourts. Such a power is recognised by this Court in\nUnion\nof India v. SICOM Ltd. In\nthat judgment, it was also held that\nsince the term “laws”, as per\nArticle 372\n, includes common\nlaw the power of judicial review of legislation, which is a\npart of common law applicable in India before the\nConstitution came into force, would continue to vest in the\nIndian courts.\n\n78. …These contours of the judicial review are spelled out\nin the clear terms in Rakesh Kohli, and particularly in the\nfollowing paragraphs: (SCC pp. 321-22 & 325-27, paras\n16-17, 26-28 & 30)\n\n“16. The statute enacted by Parliament or a State\nLegislature cannot be declared unconstitutional\nlightly. The court must be able to hold beyond any iota\nof doubt that the violation of the constitutional\nprovisions was so glaring that the legislative provision\nunder challenge cannot stand. Sans flagrant violation\nof the constitutional provisions, the law made by\nParliament or a State Legislature is not declared bad.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 114 of 567\n\n17. This Court has repeatedly stated that legislative\nenactment can be struck down by court only on two\ngrounds, namely (i) that the appropriate legislature\ndoes not have the competence to make the law, and\n\n(ii) that it does not (sic) take away or abridge any of\nthe fundamental rights enumerated in Part III of the\nConstitution or any other constitutional provisions. In\nMcDowell and Co. while dealing with the challenge to\nan enactment based on\nArticle 14\n, this Court stated in\npara 43 of the Report as follows: (SCC pp. 737-38)\n\n‘43. … A law made by Parliament or the legislature\ncan be struck down by courts on two grounds and two\ngrounds alone viz. (1) lack of legislative competence,\nand (2) violation of any of the fundamental rights\nguaranteed in Part III of the Constitution or of any\nother constitutional provision. There is no third\nground. … if an enactment is challenged as violative\nof\nArticle 14\n, it can be struck down only if it is found\nthat it is violative of the equality clause/equal\nprotection clause enshrined therein. Similarly, if an\nenactment is challenged as violative of any of the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by sub-clauses (a) to\n\n(g) of\nArticle 19(1)\n, it can be struck down only if it is\nfound not saved by any of the clauses (2) to (6) of\n\nArticle 19\nand so on. No enactment can be struck\ndown by just saying that it is arbitrary or\nunreasonable. Some or the other constitutional\ninfirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act. An\nenactment cannot be struck down on the ground that\ncourt thinks it unjustified. Parliament and the\nlegislatures, composed as they are of the\nrepresentatives of the people, are supposed to know\nand be aware of the needs of the people and what is\ngood and bad for them. The court cannot sit in\njudgment over their wisdom.’\n\nxx xx xx\n\n26. In Mohd. Hanif Quareshi, the Constitution Bench\nfurther observed that there was always a presumption\nin favour of constitutionality of an enactment and the\nburden is upon him, who attacks it, to show that there\nhas been a clear violation of the constitutional\nprinciples. It stated in para 15 of the Report as under:\n\n(AIR pp. 740-41)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 115 of 567\n\n‘15. … The courts, it is accepted, must presume that\nthe legislature understands and correctly appreciates\nthe needs of its own people, that its laws are directed\nto problems made manifest by experience and that its\ndiscriminations are based on adequate grounds. It\nmust be borne in mind that the legislature is free to\nrecognise degrees of harm and may confine its\nrestrictions to those cases where the need is deemed\nto be the clearest and finally that in order to sustain\nthe presumption of constitutionality the court may\ntake into consideration matters of common\nknowledge, matters of common report, the history of\nthe times and may assume every state of facts which\ncan be conceived existing at the time of legislation.’\n\n27. The above legal position has been reiterated by a\nConstitution Bench of this Court in\nMahant Moti Das\nv. S.P. Sahi\n.\n\n28.\nIn\nHamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India\n, inter\nalia, while referring to the earlier two decisions,\nnamely, Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. and Mahant Moti\nDas, it was observed in para 8 of the Report as\nfollows: (\nHamdard Dawakhana\ncase, AIR p. 559)\n\n‘8. Therefore, when the constitutionality of an\nenactment is challenged on the ground of violation of\nany of the articles in Part III of the Constitution, the\nascertainment of its true nature and character\nbecomes necessary i.e. its subject-matter, the area in\nwhich it is intended to operate, its purport and intent\nhave to be determined.\n\nIn order to do so it is\nlegitimate to take into consideration all the factors\nsuch as history of the legislation, the purpose thereof,\nthe surrounding circumstances and conditions, the\nmischief which it intended to suppress, the remedy for\nthe disease which the legislature resolved to cure and\nthe true reason for the remedy….’\n\nIn Hamdard Dawakhana, the Court also followed the\nstatement of law in Mahant Moti Das and the two\nearlier decisions, namely,\nCharanjit Lal Chowdhury v.\nUnion of India\nand\nState of Bombay v. F.N. Balsara\n\nand reiterated the principle that presumption was\nalways in favour of constitutionality of an enactment.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 116 of 567\n\nxx xx xx\n\n30. A well-known principle that in the field of taxation,\nthe legislature enjoys a greater latitude for\nclassification, has been noted by this Court in a long\nline of cases. Some of these decisions are Steelworth\nLtd. v. State of Assam [Steelworth Ltd. v. State of\nAssam, 1962 Supp (2) SCR 589], Gopal Narain v.\nState of U.P. [Gopal Narain v. State of U.P., AIR 1964\nSC 370], Ganga Sugar Corpn. Ltd. v. State of U.P.\n[Ganga Sugar Corpn. Ltd. v. State of U.P., (1980) 1\nSCC 223 : 1980 SCC (Tax) 90], R.K. Garg v. Union of\nIndia [R.K. Garg v. Union of India, (1981) 4 SCC 675 :\n\n1982 SCC (Tax) 30] and State of W.B. v. E.I.T.A.\nIndia Ltd. [State of W.B. v. E.I.T.A. India Ltd., (2003) 5\nSCC 239]”\n(emphasis in original)\n\nxx xx xx\n\n83. It is, thus, clear that in exercise of power of judicial\nreview, the Indian courts are invested with powers to strike\ndown primary legislation enacted by Parliament or the\nState Legislatures. However, while undertaking this\nexercise of judicial review, the same is to be done at three\nlevels. In the first stage, the Court would examine as to\nwhether impugned provision in a legislation is compatible\nwith the fundamental rights or the constitutional provisions\n(substantive judicial review) or it falls foul of the federal\ndistribution of powers (procedural judicial review). If it is not\nfound to be so, no further exercise is needed as challenge\nwould fail. On the other hand, if it is found that legislature\nlacks competence as the subject legislated was not within\nthe powers assigned in the List in Schedule VII, no further\nenquiry is needed and such a law is to be declared as ultra\nvires the Constitution. However, while undertaking\nsubstantive judicial review, if it is found that the impugned\nprovision appears to be violative of fundamental rights or\nother constitutional rights, the Court reaches the second\nstage of review. At this second phase of enquiry, the Court\nis supposed to undertake the exercise as to whether the\nimpugned provision can still be saved by reading it down\nso as to bring it in conformity with the constitutional\nprovisions. If that is not achievable then the enquiry enters\nthe third stage. If the offending portion of the statute is\nseverable, it is severed and the Court strikes down the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 117 of 567\n\nimpugned provision declaring the same as\nunconstitutional.”\n\n76) In support of the aforesaid proposition that an Act of the\n\nParliament can be invalidated only on the aforesaid two grounds,\n\npassages from various judgments were extracted 21. The Court\n\nalso noted the observations from State of A.P. & Ors. v.\n\nMCDOWELL & Co. & Ors.22 wherein it was held that apart from\n\nthe aforesaid two grounds, no third ground is available to validate\n\nany piece of legislation.\nIn the process, it was further noted that\n\nin\nRajbala & Ors. v. State of Haryana & Ors.23\n(which followed\n\nMCDOWELL & Co. case), the Court held that a legislation cannot\n\nbe declared unconstitutional on the ground that it is ‘arbitrary’\n\ninasmuch as examining as to whether a particular Act is arbitrary\n\nor not implies a value judgment and courts do not examine the\n\nwisdom of legislative choices, and, therefore, cannot undertake\n\nthis exercise.\n\n77) The issue whether law can be declared unconstitutional on the\n\nground of arbitrariness has received the attention of this Court in\n\na Constitution Bench judgment in the case of\nShayara Bano v.\n\nUnion of India & Ors.24\n.\n\nR.F. Nariman and U.U. Lalit, JJ.\n21 State of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli, (2012) 6 SCC 312;\nAshoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India\n,\n(2008) 6 SCC 1\n22 (1996) 3 SCC 709\n23 (2016) 2 SCC 445\n24 (2017) 9 SCC 1\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 118 of 567\n\ndiscredited the ratio of the aforesaid judgments wherein the Court\n\nhad held that a law cannot be declared unconstitutional on the\n\nground that it is arbitrary.\n\nThe Judges pointed out the larger\n\nBench judgment in the case of\nDr. K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of\n\nT.N. & Anr.25\nand\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India & Anr.26\nwhere\n\n‘manifest arbitrariness’ is recognised as the third ground on which\n\nthe legislative Act can be invalidated. Following discussion in this\n\nbehalf is worthy of note:\n\n“87. The thread of reasonableness runs through the entire\nfundamental rights chapter. What is manifestly arbitrary is\nobviously unreasonable and being contrary to the rule of\nlaw, would violate\nArticle 14.\nFurther, there is an apparent\ncontradiction in the three-Judge Bench decision in\n\nMcDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co.\n, (1996) 3\nSCC 709] when it is said that a constitutional challenge can\nsucceed on the ground that a law is “disproportionate,\nexcessive or unreasonable”, yet such challenge would fail\non the very ground of the law being “unreasonable,\nunnecessary or unwarranted”. The arbitrariness doctrine\nwhen applied to legislation obviously would not involve the\nlatter challenge but would only involve a law being\ndisproportionate, excessive or otherwise being manifestly\nunreasonable. All the aforesaid grounds, therefore, do not\nseek to differentiate between State action in its various\nforms, all of which are interdicted if they fall foul of the\nfundamental rights guaranteed to persons and citizens in\nPart III of the Constitution.\n\n88. We only need to point out that even after\nMcDowell\n[State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co.\n, (1996) 3 SCC 709] ,\nthis Court has in fact negated statutory law on the ground\nof it being arbitrary and therefore violative of\nArticle 14\nof\nthe Constitution of India.\nIn Malpe Vishwanath Acharya v.\n\nState of Maharashtra [Malpe Vishwanath Acharya v. State\nof Maharashtra\n, (1998) 2 SCC 1] , this Court held that after\npassage of time, a law can become arbitrary, and,\n25 (1996) 2 SCC 226\n26 (1978) 1 SCC 248\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 119 of 567\n\ntherefore, the freezing of rents at a 1940 market value\nunder the Bombay Rent Act would be arbitrary and violative\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India (see paras 8 to 15\nand 31).\n\nxx xx xx\n\n99. However, in\nState of Bihar v. Bihar Distillery Ltd. [State\nof Bihar\nv. Bihar Distillery Ltd., (1997) 2 SCC 453] , SCC at\npara 22, in\nState of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli [State of M.P.\nv.\nRakesh Kohli, (2012) 6 SCC 312 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ)\n481], SCC at paras 17 to 19, in Rajbala v. State of Haryana\n[Rajbala v. State of Haryana, (2016) 2 SCC 445], SCC at\nparas 53 to 65 and in Binoy Viswam v. Union of India\n[Binoy Viswam v. Union of India, (2017) 7 SCC 59], SCC at\nparas 80 to 82,\nMcDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and\nCo.\n, (1996) 3 SCC 709] was read as being an absolute bar\nto the use of “arbitrariness” as a tool to strike down\nlegislation under\nArticle 14.\n\nAs has been noted by us earlier\nin this judgment,\nMcDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and\nCo.\n, (1996) 3 SCC 709] itself is per incuriam, not having\nnoticed several judgments of Benches of equal or higher\nstrength, its reasoning even otherwise being flawed.\n\nThe\njudgments, following\nMcDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell\nand Co.\n, (1996) 3 SCC 709] are, therefore, no longer good\nlaw.”\n\n78) The historical development of the doctrine of arbitrariness has\n\nbeen noticed by the said Judges in Shayara Bano in detail. It\n\nwould be suffice to reproduce paragraphs 67 to 69 of\nthe said\n\njudgment\nas the discussion in these paras provide a sufficient\n\nguide as to how a doctrine of arbitrariness is to be applied while\n\nadjudging the constitutional validity of a legislation.\n\n“67. We now come to the development of the doctrine of\narbitrariness and its application to State action as a distinct\ndoctrine on which State action may be struck down as\nbeing violative of the rule of law contained in\nArticle 14.\n\nIn a\nsignificant passage, Bhagwati, J., in\nE.P. Royappa v. State\nof T.N.\nstated: (SCC p. 38, para 85)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 120 of 567\n\n“85. The last two grounds of challenge may be taken\nup together for consideration. Though we have\nformulated the third ground of challenge as a distinct\nand separate ground, it is really in substance and\neffect merely an aspect of the second ground based\non violation of\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\n\nArticle 16\nembodies\nthe fundamental guarantee that there shall be\nequality of opportunity for all citizens in matters\nrelating to employment or appointment to any office\nunder the State. Though enacted as a distinct and\nindependent fundamental right because of its great\nimportance as a principle ensuring equality of\nopportunity in public employment which is so vital to\nthe building up of the new classless egalitarian\nsociety envisaged in the Constitution,\nArticle 16\nis\nonly an instance of the application of the concept of\nequality enshrined in\nArticle 14.\nIn other words,\nArticle\nis the genus while\nArticle 16\nis a species.\nArticle\ngives effect to the doctrine of equality in all matters\nrelating to public employment. The basic principle\nwhich, therefore, informs both\nArticles 14\nand\nis\nequality and inhibition against discrimination. Now,\nwhat is the content and reach of this great equalising\nprinciple? It is a founding faith, to use the words of\nBose, J., “a way of life”, and it must not be subjected\nto a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We\ncannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all-\nembracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be\nto violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic\nconcept with many aspects and dimensions and it\ncannot be “cribbed, cabined and confined” within\ntraditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic\npoint of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In\nfact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies;\none belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the\nother, to the whim and caprice of an absolute\nmonarch. Where an act is arbitrary, it is implicit in it\nthat it is unequal both according to political logic and\nconstitutional law and is therefore violative of\nArticle\n, and if it effects any matter relating to public\nemployment, it is also violative of\nArticle 16.\n\nArticles\nand\nstrike at arbitrariness in State action and\nensure fairness and equality of treatment. They\nrequire that State action must be based on valid\nrelevant principles applicable alike to all similarly\nsituate and it must not be guided by any extraneous\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 121 of 567\n\nor irrelevant considerations because that would be\ndenial of equality. Where the operative reason for\nState action, as distinguished from motive inducing\nfrom the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate\nand relevant but is extraneous and outside the area\nof permissible considerations, it would amount to\nmala fide exercise of power and that is hit by\nArticles\nand\n16.\nMala fide exercise of power and\narbitrariness are different lethal radiations emanating\nfrom the same vice: in fact the latter comprehends the\nformer. Both are inhibited by\nArticles 14\nand 16.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n68. This was further fleshed out in\nManeka Gandhi v.\nUnion of India\n, where, after stating that various\nfundamental rights must be read together and must overlap\nand fertilise each other, Bhagwati, J., further amplified this\ndoctrine as follows: (SCC pp. 283-84, para 7)\n\n“The nature and requirement of the procedure under\n\nArticle 21\n\n7. Now, the question immediately arises as to what is\nthe requirement of\nArticle 14:\nwhat is the content and\nreach of the great equalising principle enunciated in\nthis article? There can be no doubt that it is a\nfounding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar\non which rests securely the foundation of our\ndemocratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be\nsubjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic\napproach. No attempt should be made to truncate its\nall-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would\nbe to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a\ndynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions\nand it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and\ndoctrinaire limits. We must reiterate here what was\npointed out by the majority in\nE.P. Royappa v. State\nof T.N.\n, namely, that: (SCC p. 38, para 85)\n\n‘85. … From a positivistic point of view, equality is\nantithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and\narbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the\nrule of law in a republic, while the other, to the whim\nand caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is\narbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both\naccording to political logic and constitutional law and\nis therefore violative of Article 14….’\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 122 of 567\n\nArticle 14\nstrikes at arbitrariness in State action and\nensures fairness and equality of treatment. The\nprinciple of reasonableness, which legally as well as\nphilosophically, is an essential element of equality or\nnon-arbitrariness pervades\nArticle 14\nlike a brooding\nomnipresence and the procedure contemplated by\n\nArticle 21\nmust answer the test of reasonableness in\norder to be in conformity with\nArticle 14.\nIt must be\n“right and just and fair” and not arbitrary, fanciful or\noppressive; otherwise, it would be no procedure at all\nand the requirement of\nArticle 21\nwould not be\nsatisfied.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n69. This was further clarified in\nA.L. Kalra v. Project and\nEquipment Corpn.\n, following Royappa and holding that\narbitrariness is a doctrine distinct from discrimination.\n\nIt\nwas held: (\nA.L. Kalra\ncase, SCC p. 328, para 19)\n\n“19. … It thus appears well settled that\nArticle 14\n\nstrikes at arbitrariness in executive/administrative\naction because any action that is arbitrary must\nnecessarily involve the negation of equality. One need\nnot confine the denial of equality to a comparative\nevaluation between two persons to arrive at a\nconclusion of discriminatory treatment. An action per\nse arbitrary itself denies equal of (sic) protection by\nlaw.\nThe Constitution Bench pertinently observed in\nAjay Hasia case and put the matter beyond\ncontroversy when it said: (SCC p. 741, para 16)\n\n‘16.\n… Wherever therefore, there is arbitrariness in\nState action whether it be of the legislature or of the\nexecutive or of an “authority” under\nArticle 12\n,\nArticle\nimmediately springs into action and strikes down\nsuch State action.’\n\nThis view was further elaborated and affirmed in\nD.S.\nNakara v. Union of India\n.\n\nIn\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of\nIndia\nit was observed that\nArticle 14\nstrikes at arbitrariness\nin State action and ensures fairness and equality of\ntreatment.\n\nIt is thus too late in the day to contend that an\nexecutive action shown to be arbitrary is not either judicially\nreviewable or within the reach of Article 14.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 123 of 567\n\nThe same view was reiterated in\nBabita Prasad v. State of\nBihar\n, SCC at p. 285, para 31.”\n\nThis doctrine is, thus, treated as a facet of both\nArticles 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n79) We would like to record that we have proceeded on the premise\n\nthat manifest arbitrariness also furnishes a ground on the basis\n\non which a legislative enactment can be judicially reviewed. In\n\nthe process, even the constitutional validity of\nSection 139AA\nof\n\nthe Income Tax Act, 1961 is given a fresh look on the touchstone\n\nof this norm.\n\nExplaining the doctrine/principles on which the cases are to be\ndecided:\n\n80) Our discussion up to this stage, which gives a glimpse of the\n\nattack to the Aadhaar scheme and the Aadhaar Act, spearheaded\n\nby the petitioners, would reveal that in the forefront is the right to\n\nprivacy and that forms the main pillar on which the edifice of\n\narguments is substantially constructed 27. Inbuilt in this right to\n\nprivacy is the right to live with dignity, which is a postulate of right\n\nto privacy. In the process, discussion leads to the issue of\n\nproportionality, viz. whether measures taken under the Aadhaar\n\nAct satisfy the doctrine of proportionality. We would, therefore,\n27 There are few other incidental and ancillary issues raised by the petitioners as well, which we\npropose to discuss and deal with after answering these fundamental submissions.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 124 of 567\n\nbe well advised to explain these concepts, so that their\n\napplication to the fact situation is undertaken with clear and\n\nstable norms in mind.\n\nContours of Right to Privacy:\n\n81) It stands established, with conclusive determination of the nine\n\nJudge Bench judgment of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy that right\n\nto privacy is a fundamental right. The majority judgment authored\n\nby Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. (on behalf of three other Judges) and\n\nfive concurring judgments of other five Judges have declared, in\n\nno uncertain terms and most authoritatively, right to privacy to be\n\na fundamental right. This judgment also discusses in detail the\n\nscope and ambit of right to privacy. The relevant passages in this\n\nbehalf have been reproduced above while taking note of the\n\nsubmissions of the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as\n\nrespondents. One interesting phenomenon that is discerned from\n\nthe respective submissions on either side is that both sides have\n\nplaced strong reliance on different passages from this very\n\njudgment to support their respective stances. A close reading of\n\nthis judgment brings about the following features:\n\n(i) Privacy has always been a natural right: The correct\n\nposition in this behalf has been established by a number of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 125 of 567\n\njudgments starting from Gobind v. State of M.P.28 Various\n\nopinions conclude that:\n\n(a) privacy is a concomitant of the right of the individual to\n\nexercise control over his or her personality.\n\n(b) Privacy is the necessary condition precedent to the\n\nenjoyment of any of the guarantees in Part III.\n\n(c) The fundamental right to privacy would cover at least three\n\naspects – (i) intrusion with an individual’s physical body, (ii)\n\ninformational privacy, and (iii) privacy of choice.\n\n(d) One aspect of privacy is the right to control the\n\ndissemination of personal information. And that every individual\n\nshould have a right to be able to control exercise over his/her own\n\nlife and image as portrayed in the world and to control\n\ncommercial use of his/her identity.\n\nFollowing passages from different opinions reflect the\n\naforesaid proposition:\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.:\n\n42. Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the individual to\nexercise control over his or her personality. It finds an\norigin in the notion that there are certain rights which are\nnatural to or inherent in a human being. Natural rights are\ninalienable because they are inseparable from the human\npersonality. The human element in life is impossible to\nconceive without the existence of natural rights. In 1690,\nJohn Lockehad in his Second Treatise of Government\nobserved that the lives, liberties and estates of individuals\n\n28 (1975) 2 SCC 148\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 126 of 567\n\nare as a matter of fundamental natural law, a private\npreserve. The idea of a private preserve was to create\nbarriers from outside interference. In 1765, William\nBlackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England\nspoke of a “natural liberty”. There were, in his view,\nabsolute rights which were vested in the individual by the\nimmutable laws of nature. These absolute rights were\ndivided into rights of personal security, personal liberty and\nproperty. The right of personal security involved a legal and\nuninterrupted enjoyment of life, limbs, body, health and\nreputation by an individual.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n46. Natural rights are not bestowed by the State. They\ninhere in human beings because they are human. They\nexist equally in the individual irrespective of class or strata,\ngender or orientation.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n318. Life and personal liberty are inalienable rights. These\nare rights which are inseparable from a dignified human\nexistence. The dignity of the individual, equality between\nhuman beings and the quest for liberty are the foundational\npillars of the Indian Constitution.\n\nS.A. Bobde, J. :\n\n415. Therefore, privacy is the necessary condition\nprecedent to the enjoyment of any of the guarantees in\nPart III. As a result, when it is claimed by rights bearers\nbefore constitutional courts, a right to privacy may be\nsituated not only in\nArticle 21\n, but also simultaneously in\nany of the other guarantees in Part III. In the current state\nof things,\nArticles 19(1)\n, 20(3)\n, 25\n, 28\nand\nare all rights\nhelped up and made meaningful by the exercise of privacy.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list. Future developments in\ntechnology and social ordering may well reveal that there\nare yet more constitutional sites in which a privacy right\ninheres that are not at present evident to us.\n\nR.F. Nariman, J. :\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 127 of 567\n\n521. In the Indian context, a fundamental right to privacy\nwould cover at least the following three aspects:\n\n Privacy that involves the person i.e. when there is\nsome invasion by the State of a person's rights\nrelatable to his physical body, such as the right to\nmove freely;\n\n Informational privacy which does not deal with a\nperson's body but deals with a person's mind, and\ntherefore recognises that an individual may have\ncontrol over the dissemination of material that is\npersonal to him. Unauthorised use of such\ninformation may, therefore lead to infringement of\nthis right; and\n The privacy of choice, which protects an individual's\nautonomy over fundamental personal choices.\n\nFor instance, we can ground physical privacy or privacy\nrelating to the body in Articles 19(1)(d) and (e) read with\nArticle 21; ground personal information privacy under\nArticle 21; and the privacy of choice in Articles 19(1)(a) to\n\n(c), 20(3), 21 and 25. The argument based on “privacy”\nbeing a vague and nebulous concept need not, therefore,\ndetain us.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n532. The learned counsel for the petitioners also referred to\nanother important aspect of the right to privacy. According\nto the learned counsel for the petitioner this right is a\nnatural law right which is inalienable. Indeed, the reference\norder itself, in para 12, refers to this aspect of the\nfundamental right contained. It was, therefore, argued\nbefore us that given the international conventions referred\nto hereinabove and the fact that this right inheres in every\nindividual by virtue of his being a human being, such right\nis not conferred by the Constitution but is only recognised\nand given the status of being fundamental. There is no\ndoubt that the petitioners are correct in this submission.\n\nHowever, one important roadblock in the way needs to be\ngot over.\n\n533. In ADM, Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla, a Constitution\nBench of this Court arrived at the conclusion (by majority)\nthat\nArticle 21\nis the sole repository of all rights to life and\npersonal liberty, and, when suspended, takes away those\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 128 of 567\n\nrights altogether. A remarkable dissent was that of Khanna,\nJ. [ Khanna, J. was in line to be Chief Justice of India but\nwas superseded because of this dissenting judgment. Nani\nPalkhivala in an article written on this great Judge's\nsupersession ended with a poignant sentence, “To the\nstature of such a man, the Chief Justiceship of India can\nadd nothing.” Seervai, in his monumental treatise\nConstitutional Law of India had this to say:“53. If in this\nAppendix the dissenting judgment of Khanna, J. has not\nbeen considered in detail, it is not for lack of admiration for\nthe judgment, or the courage which he showed in\ndelivering it regardless of the cost and consequences to\nhimself. It cost him the Chief Justiceship of India, but it\ngained for him universal esteem not only for his courage\nbut also for his inflexible judicial independence. If his\njudgment is not considered in detail it is because under the\ntheory of precedents which we have adopted, a dissenting\njudgment, however valuable, does not lay down the law\nand the object of a critical examination of the majority\njudgments in this Appendix was to show that those\njudgments are untenable in law, productive of grave public\nmischief and ought to be overruled at the earliest\nopportunity. The conclusion which Justice Khanna has\nreached on the effect of the suspension of\nArticle 21\nis\ncorrect. His reminder that the rule of law did not merely\nmean giving effect to an enacted law was timely, and was\nreinforced by his reference to the mass murders of millions\nof Jews in Nazi concentration camps under an enacted law.\nHowever, the legal analysis in this Chapter confirms his\nconclusion though on different grounds from those which\nhe has given.” (at Appendix p. 2229).] The learned Judge\nheld: (SCC pp. 747 & 751, paras 525 & 531)\n\n“525. The effect of the suspension of the right to\nmove any court for the enforcement of the right\nconferred by\nArticle 21\n, in my opinion, is that when a\npetition is filed in a court, the court would have to\nproceed upon the basis that no reliance can be\nplaced upon that article for obtaining relief from the\ncourt during the period of emergency. Question then\narises as to whether the rule that no one shall be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty without the\nauthority of law still survives during the period of\nemergency despite the Presidential Order suspending\nthe right to move any court for the enforcement of the\nright contained in\nArticle 21.\nThe answer to this\nquestion is linked with the answer to the question as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 129 of 567\n\nto whether\nArticle 21\nis the sole repository of the right\nto life and personal liberty. After giving the matter my\nearnest consideration, I am of the opinion that\nArticle\ncannot be considered to be the sole repository of\nthe right to life and personal liberty. The right to life\nand personal liberty is the most precious right of\nhuman beings in civilised societies governed by the\nrule of law. Many modern Constitutions incorporate\ncertain fundamental rights, including the one relating\nto personal freedom. According to Blackstone, the\nabsolute rights of Englishmen were the rights of\npersonal security, personal liberty and private\nproperty. The American Declaration of Independence\n(1776) states that all men are created equal, and\namong their inalienable rights are life, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness. The Second Amendment to the\nUS Constitution refers inter alia to security of person,\nwhile the Fifth Amendment prohibits inter alia\ndeprivation of life and liberty without due process, of\nlaw. The different Declarations of Human Rights and\nfundamental freedoms have all laid stress upon the\nsanctity of life and liberty. They have also given\nexpression in varying words to the principle that no\none shall be derived of his life or liberty without the\nauthority of law. The International Commission of\nJurists, which is affiliated to UNESCO, has been\nattempting with, considerable success to give\nmaterial content to “the rule of law”, an expression\nused in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nOne of its most notable achievements was the\nDeclaration of Delhi, 1959. This resulted from a\nCongress held in New Delhi attended by jurists from\nmore than 50 countries, and was based on a\nquestionnaire circulated to 75,000 lawyers. “Respect\nfor the supreme value of human personality” was\nstated to be the basis of all law (see p. 21 of the\nConstitutional and Administrative Law by O. Hood\nPhillips, 3rd Edn.).\n\nxx xx xx\n\n531. I am unable to subscribe to the view that when\nright to enforce the right under\nArticle 21\nis\nsuspended, the result would be that there would be\nno remedy against deprivation of a person's life or\nliberty by the State even though such deprivation is\nwithout the authority of law or even in flagrant\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 130 of 567\n\nviolation of the provisions of law. The right not to be\ndeprived of one's life or liberty without the authority of\nlaw was not the creation of the Constitution. Such\nright existed before the Constitution came into force.\nThe fact that the Framers of the Constitution made an\naspect of such right a part of the fundamental rights\ndid not have the effect of exterminating the\nindependent identity of such right and of making\n\nArticle 21\nto be the sole repository of that right. Its\nreal effect was to ensure that a law under which a\nperson can be deprived of his life or personal liberty\nshould prescribe a procedure for such deprivation or,\naccording to the dictum laid down by Mukherjea, J. in\nGopalan case [\nA.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras\n, AIR\n1950 SC 27 : 1950 SCR 88] , such law should be a\nvalid law not violative of fundamental rights\nguaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. Recognition\nas fundamental right of one aspect of the pre-\nconstitutional right cannot have the effect of making\nthings less favourable so far as the sanctity of life and\npersonal liberty is concerned compared to the\nposition if an aspect of such right had not been\nrecognised as fundamental right because of the\nvulnerability of fundamental rights accruing from\n\nArticle 359.\nI am also unable to agree that in view of\nthe Presidential Order in the matter of sanctity of life\nand liberty, things would be worse off compared to the\nstate of law as it existed before the coming into force\nof the Constitution.”\n(emphasis in original)\n\nS.K. Kaul, J.:\n\n574. I have had the benefit of reading the exhaustive and\nerudite opinions of Rohinton F. Nariman and Dr D.Y.\nChandrachud, JJ. The conclusion is the same, answering\nthe reference that privacy is not just a common law right,\nbut a fundamental right falling in Part III of the Constitution\nof India. I agree with this conclusion as privacy is a primal,\nnatural right which is inherent to an individual. However, I\nam tempted to set out my perspective on the issue of\nprivacy as a right, which to my mind, is an important core of\nany individual existence.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 131 of 567\n\n620. I had earlier adverted to an aspect of privacy — the\nright to control dissemination of personal information. The\nboundaries that people establish from others in society are\nnot only physical but also informational. There are different\nkinds of boundaries in respect to different relations. Privacy\nassists in preventing awkward social situations and\nreducing social frictions. Most of the information about\nindividuals can fall under the phrase “none of your\nbusiness”. On information being shared voluntarily, the\nsame may be said to be in confidence and any breach of\nconfidentiality is a breach of the trust. This is more so in the\nprofessional relationships such as with doctors and lawyers\nwhich requires an element of candour in disclosure of\ninformation. An individual has the right to control one's life\nwhile submitting personal data for various facilities and\nservices. It is but essential that the individual knows as to\nwhat the data is being used for with the ability to correct\nand amend it. The hallmark of freedom in a democracy is\nhaving the autonomy and control over our lives which\nbecomes impossible, if important decisions are made in\nsecret without our awareness or participation. [ Daniel\nSolove, “10 Reasons Why Privacy Matters” published on\n20-1-2014 <https://www.teachprivacy.com/10-reasons-\n\nprivacy-matters/>.]\n\nxx xx xx\n\n625. Every individual should have a right to be able to\nexercise control over his/her own life and image as\nportrayed to the world and to control commercial use of\nhis/her identity. This also means that an individual may be\npermitted to prevent others from using his image, name\nand other aspects of his/her personal life and identity for\ncommercial purposes without his/her consent. [ The\nSecond Circuit's decision in Haelan Laboratories Inc. v.\nTopps Chewing Gum Inc., 202 F 2d 866 (2d Cir 1953)\npenned by Jerome Frank, J. defined the right to publicity as\n“the right to grant the exclusive privilege of publishing his\npicture”.]”\n\nxx xx xx\n\n646. If the individual permits someone to enter the house it\ndoes not mean that others can enter the house. The only\ncheck and balance is that it should not harm the other\nindividual or affect his or her rights. This applies both to the\nphysical form and to technology. In an era where there are\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 132 of 567\n\nwide, varied, social and cultural norms and more so in a\ncountry like ours which prides itself on its diversity, privacy\nis one of the most important rights to be protected both\nagainst State and non-State actors and be recognised as a\nfundamental right. How it thereafter works out in its inter-\nplay with other fundamental rights and when such\nrestrictions would become necessary would depend on the\nfactual matrix of each case. That it may give rise to more\nlitigation can hardly be the reason not to recognise this\nimportant, natural, primordial right as a fundamental right.”\n\n(ii) The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional relationship with\n\ndignity: Privacy ensures that a human being can lead a life of\n\ndignity by securing the inner recesses of the human personality\n\nfrom unwanted intrusions. While the legitimate expectation of\n\nprivacy may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and from\n\nthe private to the public arena, it is important to underscore that\n\nprivacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is\n\nin a public place. Further, privacy is a postulate of dignity itself.\n\nAlso, privacy concerns arise when the State seeks to intrude into\n\nthe body and the mind of the citizen. This aspect is discussed in\n\nthe following manner:\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :\n\n127. The submission that recognising the right to privacy is\nan exercise which would require a constitutional\namendment and cannot be a matter of judicial\ninterpretation is not an acceptable doctrinal position. The\nargument assumes that the right to privacy is independent\nof the liberties guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.\n\nThere lies the error. The right to privacy is an element of\nhuman dignity. The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional\nrelationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 133 of 567\n\nbeing can lead a life of dignity by securing the inner\nrecesses of the human personality from unwanted\nintrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual\nand the right of every person to make essential choices\nwhich affect the course of life. In doing so privacy\nrecognises that living a life of dignity is essential for a\nhuman being to fulfill the liberties and freedoms which are\nthe cornerstone of the Constitution. To recognise the value\nof privacy as a constitutional entitlement and interest is not\nto fashion a new fundamental right by a process of\namendment through judicial fiat. Neither are the Judges nor\nis the process of judicial review entrusted with the\nconstitutional responsibility to amend the Constitution. But\njudicial review certainly has the task before it of\ndetermining the nature and extent of the freedoms\navailable to each person under the fabric of those\nconstitutional guarantees which are protected. Courts have\ntraditionally discharged that function and in the context of\n\nArticle 21\nitself, as we have already noted, a panoply of\nprotections governing different facets of a dignified\nexistence has been held to fall within the protection of\n\nArticle 21.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n297. What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy\npostulates the reservation of a private space for the\nindividual, described as the right to be let alone. The\nconcept is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The\nability of an individual to make choices lies at the core of\nthe human personality. The notion of privacy enables the\nindividual to assert and control the human element which is\ninseparable from the personality of the individual. The\ninviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in\nthe ability to make decisions on matters intimate to human\nlife. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\nmatters which can be kept private. These are concerns\nover which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The\nbody and the mind are inseparable elements of the human\npersonality. The integrity of the body and the sanctity of the\nmind can exist on the foundation that each individual\npossesses an inalienable ability and right to preserve a\nprivate space in which the human personality can develop.\nWithout the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the\npersonality would be in doubt. Recognising a zone of\nprivacy is but an acknowledgment that each individual must\nbe entitled to chart and pursue the course of development\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 134 of 567\n\nof personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human\ndignity itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which are\nintimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy\nwhere one is free of social expectations. In that zone of\nprivacy, an individual is not judged by others. Privacy\nenables each individual to take crucial decisions which find\nexpression in the human personality. It enables individuals\nto preserve their beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas,\nideologies, preferences and choices against societal\ndemands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition\nof heterogeneity, of the right of the individual to be different\nand to stand against the tide of conformity in creating a\nzone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the\nsearching glare of publicity in matters which are personal to\nhis or her life. Privacy attaches to the person and not to the\nplace where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the\nfoundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that the\nindividual can decide how liberty is best exercised.\nIndividual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a\npattern woven out of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a\nplural culture.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n322. Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity.\nPrivacy has both a normative and descriptive function. At a\nnormative level privacy subserves those eternal values\nupon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are\nfounded. At a descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle\nof entitlements and interests which lie at the foundation of\nordered liberty.\n\n323. Privacy includes at its core the preservation of\npersonal intimacies, the sanctity of family life, marriage,\nprocreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also\nconnotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards\nindividual autonomy and recognises the ability of the\nindividual to control vital aspects of his or her life. Personal\nchoices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy.\nPrivacy protects heterogeneity and recognises the plurality\nand diversity of our culture. While the legitimate\nexpectation of privacy may vary from the intimate zone to\nthe private zone and from the private to the public arenas,\nit is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or\nsurrendered merely because the individual is in a public\nplace. Privacy attaches to the person since it is an\nessential facet of the dignity of the human being.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 135 of 567\n\nS.A. Bobde, J. :\n\n407. Undoubtedly, privacy exists, as the foregoing\ndemonstrates, as a verifiable fact in all civilised societies.\n\nBut privacy does not stop at being merely a descriptive\nclaim. It also embodies a normative one. The normative\ncase for privacy is intuitively simple. Nature has clothed\nman, amongst other things, with dignity and liberty so that\nhe may be free to do what he will consistent with the\nfreedom of another and to develop his faculties to the\nfullest measure necessary to live in happiness and peace.\nThe Constitution, through its Part III, enumerates many of\nthese freedoms and their corresponding rights as\nfundamental rights. Privacy is an essential condition for the\nexercise of most of these freedoms. Ex facie, every right\nwhich is integral to the constitutional rights to dignity, life,\npersonal liberty and freedom, as indeed the right to privacy\nis, must itself be regarded as a fundamental right.\n\n408. Though he did not use the name of “privacy”, it is\nclear that it is what J.S. Mill took to be indispensable to the\nexistence of the general reservoir of liberty that\ndemocracies are expected to reserve to their citizens. In\nthe introduction to his seminal On Liberty (1859), he\ncharacterised freedom in the following way:\n\n“This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty.\nIt comprises, first, the inward domain of\nconsciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in\nthe most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and\nfeeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on\nall subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral,\nor theological. The liberty of expressing and\npublishing opinions may seem to fall under a different\nprinciple, since it belongs to that part of the conduct\nof an individual which concerns other people; but,\nbeing almost of as much importance as the liberty of\nthought itself, and resting in great part on the same\nreasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly,\nthe principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of\nframing the plan of our life to suit our own character;\nof doing as we like, subject to such consequences as\nmay follow: without impediment from our fellow\ncreatures, so long as what we do does not harm\nthem, even though they should think our conduct\nfoolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 136 of 567\n\neach individual, follows the liberty, within the same\nlimits, of combination among individuals; freedom to\nunite, for any purpose not involving harm to others:\n\nthe persons combining being supposed to be of full\nage, and not forced or deceived.\n\nNo society in which these liberties are not, on the\nwhole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form of\nGovernment; and none is completely free in which\nthey do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only\nfreedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing\nour own good in our own way, so long as we do not\nattempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their\nefforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his\nown health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual.\nMankind are greater gainers by suffering each other\nto live as seems good to themselves, than by\ncompelling each to live as seems good to the rest.\n\nThough this doctrine is anything but new, and, to\nsome persons, may have the air of a truism, there is\nno doctrine which stands more directly opposed to\nthe general tendency of existing opinion and practice.\nSociety has expended fully as much effort in the\nattempt (according to its lights) to compel people to\nconform to its notions of personal, as of social\nexcellence.” [John Stuart Mill, On Liberty and Other\nEssays (Stefan Collini Edition, 1989) (1859)]\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n409. The first and natural home for a right to privacy is in\n\nArticle 21\nat the very heart of “personal liberty” and life\nitself. Liberty and privacy are integrally connected in a way\nthat privacy is often the basic condition necessary for\nexercise of the right of personal liberty. There are\ninnumerable activities which are virtually incapable of being\nperformed at all and in many cases with dignity unless an\nindividual is left alone or is otherwise empowered to ensure\nhis or her privacy. Birth and death are events when privacy\nis required for ensuring dignity amongst all civilised people.\nPrivacy is thus one of those rights “instrumentally required\nif one is to enjoy” [ Laurence H. Tribe and Michael C. Dorf,\n“Levels of Generality in the Definition of Rights”, 57 U CHI L\nREV 1057 (1990) at p. 1068.] rights specified and\nenumerated in the constitutional text.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 137 of 567\n\n410. This Court has endorsed the view that “life” must\nmean “something more than mere animal existence” [Munn\nv. Illinois, 1876 SCC OnLine US SC 4 : 24 L Ed 77 : 94 US\n113 (1877) (Per Field, J.) as cited in Kharak Singh, (1964)\n1 SCR 332 at pp. 347-48] on a number of occasions,\nbeginning with the Constitution Bench in Sunil Batra (1) v.\nDelhi Admn. [Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn., (1978) 4 SCC 494\n: 1979 SCC (Cri) 155] Sunil Batra [Sunil Batra v. Delhi\nAdmn., (1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 155] connected\nthis view of\nArticle 21\nto the constitutional value of dignity.\nIn numerous cases, including Francis Coralie Mullin v. UT\nof Delhi [Francis Coralie Mullin v. UT of Delhi, (1981) 1\nSCC 608 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 212] , this Court has viewed\nliberty as closely linked to dignity. Their relationship to the\neffect of taking into the protection of “life” the protection of\n“faculties of thinking and feeling”, and of temporary and\npermanent impairments to those faculties.\nIn\nFrancis\nCoralie Mullin[Francis Coralie Mullin v. UT of Delhi\n, (1981)\n1 SCC 608 : 1981 SCC (Cri) 212] , Bhagwati, J. opined as\nfollows: (SCC p. 618, para 7)\n\n“7. Now obviously, the right to life enshrined in\nArticle\ncannot be restricted to mere animal existence. It\nmeans something much more than just physical\nsurvival.\nIn Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. [Kharak\nSingh v. State of U.P., AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963) 2\nCri LJ 329 : (1964) 1 SCR 332], Subba Rao, J.\n\nquoted with approval the following passage from the\njudgment of Field, J. in Munn v. Illinois [Munn v.\nIllinois, 1876 SCC OnLine US SC 4 : 24 L Ed 77 : 94\nUS 113 (1877)] to emphasise the quality of life\ncovered by\nArticle 21: (Kharak Singh case [\nKharak\nSingh v. State of U.P.\n, AIR 1963 SC 1295 : (1963) 2\nCri LJ 329 : (1964) 1 SCR 332] , AIR p. 1301, para\n\n15)\n\n15. … “By the term “life” as here used something\nmore is meant than mere animal existence. The\ninhibition against its deprivation extends to all those\nlimbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. The\nprovision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body\nor amputation of an arm or leg or the putting out of an\neye or the destruction of any other organ of the body\nthrough which the soul communicates with the outer\nworld.” ’\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 138 of 567\n\nand this passage was again accepted as laying down\nthe correct law by the Constitution Bench of this Court\nin the first Sunil Batra case [Sunil Batra v. Delhi\nAdmn., (1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 155].\n\nEvery limb or faculty through which life is enjoyed is\nthus protected by\nArticle 21\nand a fortiori, this would\ninclude the faculties of thinking and feeling. Now\ndeprivation which is inhibited by\nArticle 21\nmay be\ntotal or partial, neither any limb or faculty can be\ntotally destroyed nor can it be partially damaged.\nMoreover it is every kind of deprivation that is hit by\n\nArticle 21\n, whether such deprivation be permanent or\ntemporary and, furthermore, deprivation is not an act\nwhich is complete once and for all: it is a continuing\nact and so long as it lasts, it must be in accordance\nwith procedure established by law. It is therefore clear\nthat any act which damages or injures or interferes\nwith the use of, any limb or faculty of a person, either\npermanently or even temporarily, would be within the\ninhibition of Article 21.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nPrivacy is, therefore, necessary in both its mental and\nphysical aspects as an enabler of guaranteed freedoms.\n\n411. It is difficult to see how dignity—whose constitutional\nsignificance is acknowledged both by the Preamble and by\nthis Court in its exposition of\nArticle 21\n, among other rights\n—can be assured to the individual without privacy. Both\ndignity and privacy are intimately intertwined and are\nnatural conditions for the birth and death of individuals, and\nfor many significant events in life between these events.\nNecessarily, then, the right to privacy is an integral part of\nboth “life” and “personal liberty” under\nArticle 21\n, and is\nintended to enable the rights bearer to develop her\npotential to the fullest extent made possible only in\nconsonance with the constitutional values expressed in the\nPreamble as well as across Part III.\n\nR.F. Nariman, J:\n\n525. But most important of all is the cardinal value of\nfraternity which assures the dignity of the individual. [ In\n1834, Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure associated the\nthree terms liberty, equality and fraternity together in the\nRevue Républicaine, which he edited, as follows:“Any man\naspires to liberty, to equality, but he cannot achieve it\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 139 of 567\n\nwithout the assistance of other men, without\nfraternity.”Many of our decisions recognise human dignity\nas being an essential part of the fundamental rights\nchapter. For example, see Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi\nAdmn., (1980) 3 SCC 526 at para 21,\nFrancis Coralie\nMullin v. UT of Delhi\n, (1981) 1 SCC 608 at paras 6, 7 and\n8,\nBandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India\n, (1984) 3 SCC\n161 at para 10,\nMaharashtra University of Health Sciences\nv. Satchikitsa Prasarak Mandal\n, (2010) 3 SCC 786 at para\n37,\nShabnam v. Union of India\n, (2015) 6 SCC 702 at paras\n12.4 and 14 and\nJeeja Ghosh v. Union of India\n, (2016) 7\nSCC 761 at para 37.] The dignity of the individual\nencompasses the right of the individual to develop to the\nfull extent of his potential. And this development can only\nbe if an individual has autonomy over fundamental\npersonal choices and control over dissemination of\npersonal information which may be infringed through an\nunauthorised use of such information. It is clear that\nArticle\n, more than any of the other articles in the fundamental\nrights chapter, reflects each of these constitutional values\nin full, and is to be read in consonance with these values\nand with the international covenants that we have referred\nto. In the ultimate analysis, the fundamental right to privacy,\nwhich has so many developing facets, can only be\ndeveloped on a case-to-case basis. Depending upon the\nparticular facet that is relied upon, either\nArticle 21\nby itself\nor in conjunction with other fundamental rights would get\nattracted.\n\nS.K. Kaul, J. :\n\n618. Rohinton F. Nariman, and Dr D.Y. Chandrachud, JJ.,\nhave emphasised the importance of the protection of\nprivacy to ensure protection of liberty and dignity. I agree\nwith them and seek to refer to some legal observations in\nthis regard:\n\n618.1. In Robertson and Nicol on Media Law [ Geoffrey\nRobertson, QC and Andrew Nicol, QC, Media Law, 5th\nEdn., p. 265.] it was observed:\n\n“Individuals have a psychological need to preserve an\nintrusion-free zone for their personality and family and\nsuffer anguish and stress when that zone is violated.\nDemocratic societies must protect privacy as part of\ntheir facilitation of individual freedom, and offer some\nlegal support for the individual choice as to what\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 140 of 567\n\naspects of intimate personal life the citizen is\nprepared to share with others. This freedom in other\nwords springs from the same source as freedom of\nexpression: a liberty that enhances individual life in a\ndemocratic community.”\n\n618.2. Lord Nicholls and Lord Hoffmann in their opinion in\nNaomi Campbell case[Campbell v. MGN Ltd., (2004) 2 AC\n457 : (2004) 2 WLR 1232 : (2004) UKHL 22 (HL)]\nrecognised the importance of the protection of privacy. Lord\nHoffman opined as under: (AC p. 472 H & 473 A-D, paras\n50-51)\n\n“50. What human rights law has done is to identify\nprivate information as something worth protecting as\nan aspect of human autonomy and dignity. And this\nrecognition has raised inescapably the question of\nwhy it should be worth protecting against the state but\nnot against a private person. There may of course be\njustifications for the publication of private information\nby private persons which would not be available to\nthe state — I have particularly in mind the position of\nthe media, to which I shall return in a moment — but I\ncan see no logical ground for saying that a person\nshould have less protection against a private\nindividual than he would have against the state for the\npublication of personal information for which there is\nno justification. Nor, it appears, have any of the other\nJudges who have considered the matter.\n\n51. The result of these developments has been a shift\nin the centre of gravity of the action for breach of\nconfidence when it is used as a remedy for the\nunjustified publication of personal information. …\nInstead of the cause of action being based upon the\nduty of good faith applicable to confidential personal\ninformation and trade secrets alike, it focuses upon\nthe protection of human autonomy and dignity — the\nright to control the dissemination of information about\none's private life and the right to the esteem and\nrespect of other people.”\n\n618.3. Lord Nicholls opined as under: (Naomi Campbell\ncase [Campbell v. MGN Ltd., (2004) 2 AC 457 : (2004) 2\nWLR 1232 : (2004) UKHL 22 (HL)] , AC p. 464 D-F, para\n\n12)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 141 of 567\n\n“12. The present case concerns one aspect of\ninvasion of privacy: wrongful disclosure of private\ninformation. The case involves the familiar\ncompetition between freedom of expression and\nrespect for an individual's privacy. Both are vitally\nimportant rights. Neither has precedence over the\nother. The importance of freedom of expression has\nbeen stressed often and eloquently, the importance of\nprivacy less so. But it, too, lies at the heart of liberty in\na modern state. A proper degree of privacy is\nessential for the well-being and development of an\nindividual. And restraints imposed on government to\npry into the lives of the citizen go to the essence of a\ndemocratic state: see La Forest J. in R. v. Dyment [R.\nv. Dyment, 1988 SCC OnLine Can SC 86 : (1988) 2\nSCR 417] , SCC OnLine Can SC para 17 : SCR p.\n\n426.”\n\n619. Privacy is also the key to freedom of thought. A\nperson has a right to think. The thoughts are sometimes\ntranslated into speech but confined to the person to whom\nit is made. For example, one may want to criticise someone\nbut not share the criticism with the world.\n\nChelameswar, J.:\n\n372. History abounds with examples of attempts by\nGovernments to shape the minds of subjects. In other\nwords, conditioning the thought process by prescribing\nwhat to read or not to read; what forms of art alone are\nrequired to be appreciated leading to the conditioning of\nbeliefs; interfering with the choice of people regarding the\nkind of literature, music or art which an individual would\nprefer to enjoy. [Stanleyv.

Explanation II.—In sub-clause (b) of\nclause (2), the reference to Hindus shall be construed as\nincluding a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina\nor Buddhist religion, and the reference to Hindu religious\ninstitutions shall be construed accordingly.”] the freedom of\nconscience and right to freely profess, practice and\npropagate religion. While the right to freely “profess,\npractice and propagate religion” may be a facet of free\nspeech guaranteed under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n, the freedom of\nthe belief or faith in any religion is a matter of conscience\nfalling within the zone of purely private thought process and\nis an aspect of liberty. There are areas other than religious\nbeliefs which form part of the individual's freedom of\nconscience such as political belief, etc. which form part of\nthe liberty under\nArticle 21.\n\n373. Concerns of privacy arise when the State seeks to\nintrude into the body of subjects. [Skinner v. Oklahoma,\n1942 SCC OnLine US SC 125 : 86 L Ed 1655 : 316 US 535\n(1942)“20. There are limits to the extent to which a\nlegislatively represented majority may conduct biological\nexperiments at the expense of the dignity and personality\nand natural powers of a minority—even those who have\nbeen guilty of what the majority defines as crimes.” (SCC\nOnLine US SC para 20)—Jackson, J.] Corporeal\npunishments were not unknown to India, their abolition is of\na recent vintage. Forced feeding of certain persons by the\nState raises concerns of privacy. An individual's rights to\nrefuse life prolonging medical treatment or terminate his life\nis another freedom which falls within the zone of the right to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 143 of 567\n\nprivacy. I am conscious of the fact that the issue is pending\nbefore this Court. But in various other jurisdictions, there is\na huge debate on those issues though it is still a grey area.\n[ For the legal debate in this area in US, See Chapter 15.11\nof American Constitutional Law by Laurence H. Tribe, 2nd\nEdn.] A woman's freedom of choice whether to bear a child\nor abort her pregnancy are areas which fall in the realm of\nprivacy. Similarly, the freedom to choose either to work or\nnot and the freedom to choose the nature of the work are\nareas of private decision-making process. The right to\ntravel freely within the country or go abroad is an area\nfalling within the right to privacy. The text of our\nConstitution recognised the freedom to travel throughout\nthe country under\nArticle 19(1)(d).\nThis Court has already\nrecognised that such a right takes within its sweep the right\nto travel abroad.\n[\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n, (1978)\n1 SCC 248] A person's freedom to choose the place of his\nresidence once again is a part of his right to privacy\n[Williams v. Fears, 1900 SCC OnLine US SC 211 : 45 L Ed\n186 : 179 US 270 (1900)—“8. Undoubtedly the right of\nlocomotion, the right to remove from one place to another\naccording to inclination, is an attribute of personal\nliberty….” (SCC OnLine US SC para 8)] recognised by the\nConstitution of India under\nArticle 19(1)(e)\nthough the\npredominant purpose of enumerating the abovementioned\ntwo freedoms in\nArticle 19(1)\nis to disable both the federal\nand State Governments from creating barriers which are\nincompatible with the federal nature of our country and its\nConstitution. The choice of appearance and apparel are\nalso aspects of the right to privacy. The freedom of certain\ngroups of subjects to determine their appearance and\napparel (such as keeping long hair and wearing a turban)\nare protected not as a part of the right to privacy but as a\npart of their religious belief. Such a freedom need not\nnecessarily be based on religious beliefs falling under\n\nArticle 25.\nInformational traces are also an area which is\nthe subject-matter of huge debate in various jurisdictions\nfalling within the realm of the right to privacy, such data is\nas personal as that of the choice of appearance and\napparel. Telephone tappings and internet hacking by State,\nof personal data is another area which falls within the realm\nof privacy. The instant reference arises out of such an\nattempt by the Union of India to collect biometric data\nregarding all the residents of this country. The\nabovementioned are some of the areas where some\ninterest of privacy exists. The examples given above\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 144 of 567\n\nindicate to some extent the nature and scope of the right to\nprivacy.\n\n374. I do not think that anybody in this country would like to\nhave the officers of the State intruding into their homes or\nprivate property at will or soldiers quartered in their houses\nwithout their consent. I do not think that anybody would like\nto be told by the State as to what they should eat or how\nthey should dress or whom they should be associated with\neither in their personal, social or political life. Freedom of\nsocial and political association is guaranteed to citizens\nunder\nArticle 19(1)(c).\nPersonal association is still a\ndoubtful area. [The High Court of A.P. held that\nArticle 19(1)\n\n(c) would take within its sweep the matrimonial association\nin\nT. Sareetha v. T. Venkata Subbaiah\n, 1983 SCC OnLine\nAP 90 : AIR 1983 AP 356.\n\nHowever, this case was later\noverruled by this Court in\nSaroj Rani v. Sudarshan Kumar\nChadha\n, (1984) 4 SCC 90 : AIR 1984 SC 1562.] The\ndecision-making process regarding the freedom of\nassociation, freedoms of travel and residence are purely\nprivate and fall within the realm of the right to privacy. It is\none of the most intimate decisions.\n\n375. All liberal democracies believe that the State should\nnot have unqualified authority to intrude into certain\naspects of human life and that the authority should be\nlimited by parameters constitutionally fixed. Fundamental\nrights are the only constitutional firewall to prevent State's\ninterference with those core freedoms constituting liberty of\na human being. The right to privacy is certainly one of the\ncore freedoms which is to be defended. It is part of liberty\nwithin the meaning of that expression in\nArticle 21.\n\n376. I am in complete agreement with the conclusions\nrecorded by my learned Brothers in this regard.”\n\n(iii) Privacy is intrinsic to freedom, liberty and dignity: The right\n\nto privacy is inherent to the liberties guaranteed by Part-III of the\n\nConstitution and privacy is an element of human dignity. The\n\nfundamental right to privacy derives from Part-III of the\n\nConstitution and recognition of this right does not require a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 145 of 567\n\nconstitutional amendment. Privacy is more than merely a\n\nderivative constitutional right. It is the necessary basis of rights\n\nguaranteed in the text of the Constitution. Discussion in this\n\nbehalf is captured in the following passages:\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :\n\n127. The submission that recognising the right to privacy is\nan exercise which would require a constitutional\namendment and cannot be a matter of judicial\ninterpretation is not an acceptable doctrinal position. The\nargument assumes that the right to privacy is independent\nof the liberties guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.\n\nThere lies the error. The right to privacy is an element of\nhuman dignity. The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional\nrelationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human\nbeing can lead a life of dignity by securing the inner\nrecesses of the human personality from unwanted\nintrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual\nand the right of every person to make essential choices\nwhich affect the course of life. In doing so privacy\nrecognises that living a life of dignity is essential for a\nhuman being to fulfill the liberties and freedoms which are\nthe cornerstone of the Constitution. To recognise the value\nof privacy as a constitutional entitlement and interest is not\nto fashion a new fundamental right by a process of\namendment through judicial fiat. Neither are the Judges nor\nis the process of judicial review entrusted with the\nconstitutional responsibility to amend the Constitution. But\njudicial review certainly has the task before it of\ndetermining the nature and extent of the freedoms\navailable to each person under the fabric of those\nconstitutional guarantees which are protected. Courts have\ntraditionally discharged that function and in the context of\n\nArticle 21\nitself, as we have already noted, a panoply of\nprotections governing different facets of a dignified\nexistence has been held to fall within the protection of\n\nArticle 21.\n\nS.A. Bobde, J. :\n\n416. There is nothing unusual in the judicial enumeration of\none right on the basis of another under the Constitution. In\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 146 of 567\n\nthe case of\nArticle 21\n's guarantee of “personal liberty”, this\npractice is only natural if Salmond's formulation of liberty as\n“incipient rights” [ P.J. Fitzgerald, Salmond on\nJurisprudence at p. 228.] is correct. By the process of\nenumeration, constitutional courts merely give a name and\nspecify the core of guarantees already present in the\nresidue of constitutional liberty. Over time, the Supreme\nCourt has been able to imply by its interpretative process\nthat several fundamental rights including the right to\nprivacy emerge out of expressly stated fundamental rights.\n\nIn Unni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P. [Unni Krishnan,\nJ.P. v.\nState of A.P.\n, (1993) 1 SCC 645] , a Constitution Bench of\nthis Court held that “several unenumerated rights fall within\n\nArticle 21\nsince personal liberty is of widest amplitude”\n[\nUnni Krishnan, J.P. v. State of A.P.\n, (1993) 1 SCC 645 at p.\n669, para 29] on the way to affirming the existence of a\nright to education.

Narayan Khimalal\nTotame, (1990) 1 SCC 520] .”\n\nIn the case of privacy, the case for judicial enumeration is\nespecially strong. It is no doubt a fair implication from\n\nArticle 21\n, but also more. Privacy is a right or condition,\n“logically presupposed” [ Laurence H. Tribe And Michael C.\nDorf, “Levels Of Generality in the Definition of Rights”, 57 U\nCHI L REV 1057 (1990) at p. 1068.] by rights expressly\nrecorded in the constitutional text, if they are to make\nsense. As a result, privacy is more than merely a derivative\nconstitutional right. It is the necessary and unavoidable\nlogical entailment of rights guaranteed in the text of the\nConstitution.\n\nR.F. Nariman, J:\n\n482. Shri Sundaram has argued that rights have to be\ntraced directly to those expressly stated in the fundamental\nrights chapter of the Constitution for such rights to receive\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 148 of 567\n\nprotection, and privacy is not one of them. It will be noticed\nthat the dignity of the individual is a cardinal value, which is\nexpressed in the Preamble to the Constitution. Such dignity\nis not expressly stated as a right in the fundamental rights\nchapter, but has been read into the right to life and\npersonal liberty. The right to live with dignity is expressly\nread into\nArticle 21\nby the judgment in Jolly George\nVarghesev. Bank of Cochin [Jolly George Varghese v.\n\nBank of Cochin, (1980) 2 SCC 360] , at para 10. Similarly,\nthe right against bar fetters and handcuffing being integral\nto an individual's dignity was read into\nArticle 21\nby the\njudgment in Sunil Batra v. Delhi Admn. [Sunil Batra v. Delhi\nAdmn., (1978) 4 SCC 494 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 155] , at paras\n192, 197-B, 234 and 241 and Prem Shankar Shukla v.\nDelhi Admn. [Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Admn., (1980)\n3 SCC 526 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 815] , at paras 21 and 22. It is\ntoo late in the day to canvas that a fundamental right must\nbe traceable to express language in Part III of the\nConstitution. As will be pointed out later in this judgment, a\nConstitution has to be read in such a way that words\ndeliver up principles that are to be followed and if this is\nkept in mind, it is clear that the concept of privacy is\ncontained not merely in personal liberty, but also in the\ndignity of the individual.”\n\n(iv) Privacy has both positive and negative content: The\n\nnegative content restrains the State from committing an intrusion\n\nupon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive content\n\nimposes an obligation on the State to take all necessary\n\nmeasures to protect the privacy of the individual.\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.:\n\n326. Privacy has both positive and negative content. The\nnegative content restrains the State from committing an\nintrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its\npositive content imposes an obligation on the State to take\nall necessary measures to protect the privacy of the\nindividual.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 149 of 567\n\n(v) Informational Privacy is a facet of right to privacy: The old\n\nadage that ‘knowledge is power’ has stark implications for the\n\nposition of individual where data is ubiquitous, an all-\n\nencompassing presence. Every transaction of an individual user\n\nleaves electronic tracks without her knowledge. Individually these\n\ninformation silos may seem inconsequential. In aggregation,\n\ninformation provides a picture of the beings. The challenges\n\nwhich big data poses to privacy emanate from both State and\n\nnon-State entities. This proposition is described in the following\n\nmanner:\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.:\n\n300. Ours is an age of information. Information is\nknowledge. The old adage that “knowledge is power” has\nstark implications for the position of the individual where\ndata is ubiquitous, an all-encompassing presence.\n\nTechnology has made life fundamentally interconnected.\nThe internet has become all-pervasive as individuals spend\nmore and more time online each day of their lives.\nIndividuals connect with others and use the internet as a\nmeans of communication. The internet is used to carry on\nbusiness and to buy goods and services. Individuals\nbrowse the web in search of information, to send e-mails,\nuse instant messaging services and to download movies.\nOnline purchases have become an efficient substitute for\nthe daily visit to the neighbouring store. Online banking has\nredefined relationships between bankers and customers.\nOnline trading has created a new platform for the market in\nsecurities. Online music has refashioned the radio. Online\nbooks have opened up a new universe for the bibliophile.\nThe old-fashioned travel agent has been rendered\nredundant by web portals which provide everything from\nrestaurants to rest houses, airline tickets to art galleries,\nmuseum tickets to music shows. These are but a few of the\nreasons people access the internet each day of their lives.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 150 of 567\n\nYet every transaction of an individual user and every site\nthat she visits, leaves electronic tracks generally without\nher knowledge. These electronic tracks contain powerful\nmeans of information which provide knowledge of the sort\nof person that the user is and her interests [See Francois\nNawrot, Katarzyna Syska and Przemyslaw Switalski,\n“Horizontal Application of Fundamental Rights — Right to\nPrivacy on the Internet”, 9th Annual European\nConstitutionalism Seminar (May 2010), University of\nWarsaw, available at <http://en.zpc.wpia.uw.edu.pl/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2010/04/9_Horizontal_Application_of_Fun\ndamental_Rights.pdf>.] . Individually, these information\nsilos may seem inconsequential. In aggregation, they\ndisclose the nature of the personality: food habits,\nlanguage, health, hobbies, sexual preferences, friendships,\nways of dress and political affiliation. In aggregation,\ninformation provides a picture of the being: of things which\nmatter and those that do not, of things to be disclosed and\nthose best hidden.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n304. Data mining processes together with knowledge\ndiscovery can be combined to create facts about\nindividuals. Metadata and the internet of things have the\nability to redefine human existence in ways which are yet\nfully to be perceived. This, as Christina Moniodis states in\nher illuminating article, results in the creation of new\nknowledge about individuals; something which even she or\nhe did not possess. This poses serious issues for the\nCourt. In an age of rapidly evolving technology it is\nimpossible for a Judge to conceive of all the possible uses\nof information or its consequences:\n\n“… The creation of new knowledge complicates data\nprivacy law as it involves information the individual\ndid not possess and could not disclose, knowingly or\notherwise. In addition, as our State becomes an\n“information State” through increasing reliance on\ninformation—such that information is described as the\n“lifeblood that sustains political, social, and business\ndecisions. It becomes impossible to conceptualize all\nof the possible uses of information and resulting\nharms. Such a situation poses a challenge for courts\nwho are effectively asked to anticipate and remedy\ninvisible, evolving harms.” [ Christina P. Moniodis,\n“Moving from Nixon to NASA: Privacy's Second\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 151 of 567\n\nStrand — A Right to Informational Privacy”, Yale\nJournal of Law and Technology (2012), Vol. 15 (1), at\np. 154.]\n\nThe contemporary age has been aptly regarded as “an era\nof ubiquitous dataveillance, or the systematic monitoring of\ncitizen's communications or actions through the use of\ninformation technology” [Yvonne McDermott,\n“Conceptualizing the Right to Data Protection in an Era of\nBig Data”, Big Data and Society (2017), at p. 1.] . It is also\nan age of “big data” or the collection of data sets. These\ndata sets are capable of being searched; they have\nlinkages with other data sets; and are marked by their\nexhaustive scope and the permanency of collection. [Id, at\npp. 1 and 4.] The challenges which big data poses to\nprivacy interests emanate from State and non-State\nentities. Users of wearable devices and social media\nnetworks may not conceive of themselves as having\nvolunteered data but their activities of use and engagement\nresult in the generation of vast amounts of data about\nindividual lifestyles, choices and preferences. Yvonne\nMcDermott speaks about the quantified self in eloquent\nterms:\n\n“… The rise in the so-called ‘quantified self’, or the\nself-tracking of biological, environmental, physical, or\nbehavioural information through tracking devices,\nInternet-of-things devices, social network data and\nother means (?Swan.2013) may result in information\nbeing gathered not just about the individual user, but\nabout people around them as well. Thus, a solely\nconsent-based model does not entirely ensure the\nprotection of one's data, especially when data\ncollected for one purpose can be repurposed for\nanother.” [Id, at p. 4.]\n\nxx xx xx\n\n328. Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy.\n\nThe dangers to privacy in an age of information can\noriginate not only from the State but from non-State actors\nas well. We commend to the Union Government the need\nto examine and put into place a robust regime for data\nprotection. The creation of such a regime requires a careful\nand sensitive balance between individual interests and\nlegitimate concerns of the State. The legitimate aims of the\nState would include for instance protecting national\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 152 of 567\n\nsecurity, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging\ninnovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing\nthe dissipation of social welfare benefits. These are matters\nof policy to be considered by the Union Government while\ndesigning a carefully structured regime for the protection of\nthe data. Since the Union Government has informed the\nCourt that it has constituted a Committee chaired by\nHon'ble Shri Justice B.N. Srikrishna, former Judge of this\nCourt, for that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with\nappropriately by the Union Government having due regard\nto what has been set out in this judgment.\n\nS.K. Kaul, J.:\n\n585. The growth and development of technology has\ncreated new instruments for the possible invasion of\nprivacy by the State, including through surveillance,\nprofiling and data collection and processing. Surveillance is\nnot new, but technology has permitted surveillance in ways\nthat are unimaginable. Edward Snowden shocked the\nworld with his disclosures about global surveillance. States\nare utilising technology in the most imaginative ways\nparticularly in view of increasing global terrorist attacks and\nheightened public safety concerns. One such technique\nbeing adopted by the States is “profiling”. The European\nUnion Regulation of 2016 [ Regulation No. (EU) 2016/679\nof the European Parliament and of the Council of 27-4-\n\n2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the\nprocessing of personal data and on the free movement of\nsuch data, and repealing Directive No. 95/46/EC (General\nData Protection Regulation).] on data privacy defines\n“profiling” as any form of automated processing of personal\ndata consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate\ncertain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in\nparticular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that\nnatural person's performance at work, economic situation,\nhealth, personal preferences, interests, reliability,\nbehaviour, location or movements [ Regulation No. (EU)\n2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of\n27-4-2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard\nto the processing of personal data and on the free\nmovement of such data, and repealing Directive No.\n95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).] . Such\nprofiling can result in discrimination based on religion,\nethnicity and caste. However, “profiling” can also be used\nto further public interest and for the benefit of national\nsecurity.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 153 of 567\n\n586. The security environment, not only in our country, but\nthroughout the world makes the safety of persons and the\nState a matter to be balanced against this right to privacy.\n\n587. The capacity of non-State actors to invade the home\nand privacy has also been enhanced. Technological\ndevelopment has facilitated journalism that is more\nintrusive than ever before.\n\n588. Further, in this digital age, individuals are constantly\ngenerating valuable data which can be used by non-State\nactors to track their moves, choices and preferences. Data\nis generated not just by active sharing of information, but\nalso passively, with every click on the “world wide web”.\nWe are stated to be creating an equal amount of\ninformation every other day, as humanity created from the\nbeginning of recorded history to the year 2003 — enabled\nby the “world wide web”. [ Michael L. Rustad,\nSannaKulevska, “Reconceptualizing the right to be\nforgotten to enable transatlantic data flow”, (2015) 28 Harv\nJL & Tech 349.]\n\n589. Recently, it was pointed out that “ “Uber”, the world's\nlargest taxi company, owns no vehicles. “Facebook”, the\nworld's most popular media owner, creates no content.\n“Alibaba”, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And\n“Airbnb”, the world's largest accommodation provider, owns\nno real estate. Something interesting is happening.” [ Tom\nGoodwin “The Battle is for Customer Interface”,\n<https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/in-the-age-of-\ndisintermediation-the-battle-is-all-for-the-customer-\ninterface/>.] “Uber” knows our whereabouts and the places\nwe frequent. “Facebook” at the least, knows who we are\nfriends with. “Alibaba” knows our shopping habits. “Airbnb”\nknows where we are travelling to. Social network providers,\nsearch engines, e-mail service providers, messaging\napplications are all further examples of non-State actors\nthat have extensive knowledge of our movements, financial\ntransactions, conversations — both personal and\nprofessional, health, mental state, interest, travel locations,\nfares and shopping habits. As we move towards becoming\na digital economy and increase our reliance on internet-\nbased services, we are creating deeper and deeper digital\nfootprints — passively and actively.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 154 of 567\n\n590. These digital footprints and extensive data can be\nanalysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and\nassociations, especially relating to human behaviour and\ninteractions and hence, is valuable information. This is the\nage of “big data”. The advancement in technology has\ncreated not just new forms of data, but also new methods\nof analysing the data and has led to the discovery of new\nuses for data. The algorithms are more effective and the\ncomputational power has magnified exponentially. A large\nnumber of people would like to keep such search history\nprivate, but it rarely remains private, and is collected, sold\nand analysed for purposes such as targeted advertising. Of\ncourse, “big data” can also be used to further public\ninterest. There may be cases where collection and\nprocessing of big data is legitimate and proportionate,\ndespite being invasive of privacy otherwise.\n\n591. Knowledge about a person gives a power over that\nperson. The personal data collected is capable of effecting\nrepresentations, influencing decision-making processes\nand shaping behaviour. It can be used as a tool to exercise\ncontrol over us like the “big brother” State exercised. This\ncan have a stultifying effect on the expression of dissent\nand difference of opinion, which no democracy can afford.\n\n592. Thus, there is an unprecedented need for regulation\nregarding the extent to which such information can be\nstored, processed and used by non-State actors. There is\nalso a need for protection of such information from the\nState. Our Government was successful in compelling\nBlackberry to give to it the ability to intercept data sent over\nBlackberry devices. While such interception may be\ndesirable and permissible in order to ensure national\nsecurity, it cannot be unregulated. [ Kadhim Shubber,\n“Blackberry gives Indian Government ability to intercept\nmessages” published by Wired on 11-7-2013\n<http://www.wired.co.uk/article/blackberry-india>.]\n\n593. The concept of “invasion of privacy” is not the early\nconventional thought process of “poking ones nose in\nanother person's affairs”. It is not so simplistic. In today's\nworld, privacy is a limit on the Government's power as well\nas the power of private sector entities.

George Orwell created a fictional State in Nineteen\nEighty-Four. Today, it can be a reality. The technological\ndevelopment today can enable not only the State, but also\nbig corporations and private entities to be the “big brother”.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n629. The right of an individual to exercise control over his\npersonal data and to be able to control his/her own life\nwould also encompass his right to control his existence on\nthe internet. Needless to say that this would not be an\nabsolute right. The existence of such a right does not imply\nthat a criminal can obliterate his past, but that there are\nvariant degrees of mistakes, small and big, and it cannot\nbe said that a person should be profiled to the nth extent\nfor all and sundry to know.\n\n630. A high school teacher was fired after posting on her\nFacebook page that she was “so not looking forward to\nanother [school] year” since the school district's residents\nwere “arrogant and snobby”. A flight attendant was fired for\nposting suggestive photos of herself in the company's\nuniform. [ Patricia Sánchez Abril, “Blurred Boundaries:\n\nSocial Media Privacy and the Twenty-First-Century\nEmployee”, 49 Am Bus LJ 63 at p. 69 (2012).] In the pre-\ndigital era, such incidents would have never occurred.\nPeople could then make mistakes and embarrass\nthemselves, with the comfort that the information will be\ntypically forgotten over time.\n\n631. The impact of the digital age results in information on\nthe internet being permanent. Humans forget, but the\ninternet does not forget and does not let humans forget.\nAny endeavour to remove information from the internet\ndoes not result in its absolute obliteration.

It is thus, said that in the digital world preservation\nis the norm and forgetting a struggle [ Ravi Antani, “ THE\nRESISTANCE OF MEMORY : COULD THE EUROPEAN UNION'S\nRIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN EXIST IN THE UNITED STATES?”, 30\nBerkeley Tech LJ 1173 (2015).] .\n\n632. The technology results almost in a sort of a\npermanent storage in some way or the other making it\ndifficult to begin life again giving up past mistakes.

But they are entitled to\nre-invent themselves and reform and correct their\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 156 of 567\n\nmistakes. It is privacy which nurtures this ability and\nremoves the shackles of unadvisable things which may\nhave been done in the past.\n\n633. Children around the world create perpetual digital\nfootprints on social network websites on a 24/7 basis as\nthey learn their “ABCs”: Apple, Bluetooth and chat followed\nby download, e-mail, Facebook, Google, Hotmail and\nInstagram.

Privacy of\nchildren will require special protection not just in the\ncontext of the virtual world, but also the real world.\n\n634. People change and an individual should be able to\ndetermine the path of his life and not be stuck only on a\npath of which he/she treaded initially. An individual should\nhave the capacity to change his/her beliefs and evolve as a\nperson. Individuals should not live in fear that the views\nthey expressed will forever be associated with them and\nthus refrain from expressing themselves.\n\n635. Whereas this right to control dissemination of personal\ninformation in the physical and virtual space should not\namount to a right of total eraser of history, this right, as a\npart of the larger right to privacy, has to be balanced\nagainst other fundamental rights like the freedom of\nexpression, or freedom of media, fundamental to a\ndemocratic society.\n\n636. Thus, the European Union Regulation of 2016\n[Regulation No. (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament\nand of the Council of 27-4-2016 on the protection of natural\npersons with regard to the processing of personal data and\non the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive\nNo. 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).] has\nrecognised what has been termed as “the right to be\nforgotten”. This does not mean that all aspects of earlier\nexistence are to be obliterated, as some may have a social\nramification. If we were to recognise a similar right, it would\nonly mean that an individual who is no longer desirous of\nhis personal data to be processed or stored, should be\nable to remove it from the system where the personal\ndata/information is no longer necessary, relevant, or is\nincorrect and serves no legitimate interest. Such a right\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 157 of 567\n\ncannot be exercised where the information/data is\nnecessary, for exercising the right of freedom of expression\nand information, for compliance with legal obligations, for\nthe performance of a task carried out in public interest, on\nthe grounds of public interest in the area of public health,\nfor archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or\nhistorical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for\nthe establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nSuch justifications would be valid in all cases of breach of\nprivacy, including breaches of data privacy.”\n\n(vi) Right to privacy cannot be impinged without a just, fair and\n\nreasonable law: It has to fulfill the test of proportionality i.e. (i)\n\nexistence of a law; (ii) must serve a legitimate State aim; and (iii)\n\nproportionality.\n\n“Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :\n\n310. While it intervenes to protect legitimate State\ninterests, the State must nevertheless put into place a\nrobust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a threefold\nrequirement. These three requirements apply to all\nrestraints on privacy (not just informational privacy). They\nemanate from the procedural and content-based mandate\nof\nArticle 21.\nThe first requirement that there must be a law\nin existence to justify an encroachment on privacy is an\nexpress requirement of\nArticle 21.\nFor, no person can be\ndeprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance\nwith the procedure established by law. The existence of law\nis an essential requirement. Second, the requirement of a\nneed, in terms of a legitimate State aim, ensures that the\nnature and content of the law which imposes the restriction\nfalls within the zone of reasonableness mandated by\nArticle\n, which is a guarantee against arbitrary State action. The\npursuit of a legitimate State aim ensures that the law does\nnot suffer from manifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a\npostulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial review does\nnot reappreciate or second guess the value judgment of\nthe legislature but is for deciding whether the aim which is\nsought to be pursued suffers from palpable or manifest\narbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the\nmeans which are adopted by the legislature are\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 158 of 567\n\nproportional to the object and needs sought to be fulfilled\nby the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the\nguarantee against arbitrary State action because it ensures\nthat the nature and quality of the encroachment on the right\nis not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence,\nthe threefold requirement for a valid law arises out of the\nmutual interdependence between the fundamental\nguarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and the\nprotection of life and personal liberty, on the other. The\nright to privacy, which is an intrinsic part of the right to life\nand liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is subject\nto the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.\n\n311. Apart from national security, the State may have\njustifiable reasons for the collection and storage of data. In\na social welfare State, the Government embarks upon\nprogrammes which provide benefits to impoverished and\nmarginalised sections of society. There is a vital State\ninterest in ensuring that scarce public resources are not\ndissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do\nnot qualify as recipients. Allocation of resources for human\ndevelopment is coupled with a legitimate concern that the\nutilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for\nextraneous purposes. Data mining with the object of\nensuring that resources are properly deployed to legitimate\nbeneficiaries is a valid ground for the State to insist on the\ncollection of authentic data. But, the data which the State\nhas collected has to be utilised for legitimate purposes of\nthe State and ought not to be utilised unauthorisedly for\nextraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate\nconcerns of the State are duly safeguarded while, at the\nsame time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention and\ninvestigation of crime and protection of the revenue are\namong the legitimate aims of the State. Digital platforms\nare a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a social\nwelfare State. Information technology—legitimately\ndeployed is a powerful enabler in the spread of innovation\nand knowledge.\n\n312. A distinction has been made in contemporary\nliterature between anonymity on one hand and privacy on\nthe other. [See in this connection, Jeffrey M. Skopek,\n“Reasonable Expectations of Anonymity”, Virginia Law\nReview (2015), Vol. 101, at pp. 691-762.] Both anonymity\nand privacy prevent others from gaining access to pieces\nof personal information yet they do so in opposite ways.\n\nPrivacy involves hiding information whereas anonymity\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 159 of 567\n\ninvolves hiding what makes it personal. An unauthorised\nparting of the medical records of an individual which have\nbeen furnished to a hospital will amount to an invasion of\nprivacy. On the other hand, the State may assert a\nlegitimate interest in analysing data borne from hospital\nrecords to understand and deal with a public health\nepidemic such as malaria or dengue to obviate a serious\nimpact on the population. If the State preserves the\nanonymity of the individual it could legitimately assert a\nvalid State interest in the preservation of public health to\ndesign appropriate policy interventions on the basis of the\ndata available to it.\n\n313. Privacy has been held to be an intrinsic element of the\nright to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21\nand as a\nconstitutional value which is embodied in the fundamental\nfreedoms embedded in Part III of the Constitution. Like the\nright to life and liberty, privacy is not absolute. The\nlimitations which operate on the right to life and personal\nliberty would operate on the right to privacy. Any\ncurtailment or deprivation of that right would have to take\nplace under a regime of law. The procedure established by\nlaw must be fair, just and reasonable. The law which\nprovides for the curtailment of the right must also be\nsubject to constitutional safeguards.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n325. Like other rights which form part of the fundamental\nfreedoms protected by Part III, including the right to life and\npersonal liberty under\nArticle 21\n, privacy is not an absolute\nright. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to\nwithstand the touchstone of permissible restrictions on\nfundamental rights. In the context of\nArticle 21\nan invasion\nof privacy must be justified on the basis of a law which\nstipulates a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable.\nThe law must also be valid with reference to the\nencroachment on life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21.\n\nAn invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the\nthreefold requirement of (i) legality, which postulates the\nexistence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate\nState aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a rational\nnexus between the objects and the means adopted to\nachieve them.\n\nS.A. Bobde, J. :\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 160 of 567\n\n426. There is no doubt that privacy is integral to the several\nfundamental rights recognised by Part III of the Constitution\nand must be regarded as a fundamental right itself. The\nrelationship between the right to privacy and the particular\nfundamental right (or rights) involved would depend on the\naction interdicted by a particular law. At a minimum, since\nprivacy is always integrated with personal liberty, the\nconstitutionality of the law which is alleged to have invaded\ninto a rights bearer's privacy must be tested by the same\nstandards by which a law which invades personal liberty\nunder\nArticle 21\nis liable to be tested. Under\nArticle 21\n, the\nstandard test at present is the rationality review expressed\nin\nManeka Gandhi\ncase [\nManeka Gandhi v. Union of India\n,\n(1978) 1 SCC 248] .\nThis requires that any procedure by\nwhich the State interferes with an Article 21 right to be “fair,\njust and reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary”\n[Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248 at p.\n\n323, para 48].\n\nR.F. Nariman, J. :\n\n526. But this is not to say that such a right is absolute. This\nright is subject to reasonable regulations made by the State\nto protect legitimate State interests or public interest.\n\nHowever, when it comes to restrictions on this right, the drill\nof various articles to which the right relates must be\nscrupulously followed. For example, if the restraint on\nprivacy is over fundamental personal choices that an\nindividual is to make, State action can be restrained under\n\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 14\nif it is arbitrary and\nunreasonable; and under\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 19(1)\n\n(a) only if it relates to the subjects mentioned in\nArticle\n19(2)\nand the tests\nlaid down by\nthis Court for such\nlegislation or subordinate legislation to pass muster under\nthe said article. Each of the tests evolved by this Court, qua\nlegislation or executive action, under\nArticle 21\nread with\n\nArticle 14;\nor\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nin the\naforesaid examples must be met in order that State action\npass muster. In the ultimate analysis, the balancing act that\nis to be carried out between individual, societal and State\ninterests must be left to the training and expertise of the\njudicial mind.\n\nS.K. Kaul, J. :\n\n638. The concerns expressed on behalf of the petitioners\narising from the possibility of the State infringing the right to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 161 of 567\n\nprivacy can be met by the test suggested for limiting the\ndiscretion of the State:\n\n“(i) The action must be sanctioned by law;\n\n(ii) The proposed action must be necessary in a democratic\nsociety for a legitimate aim;\n\n(iii) The extent of such interference must be proportionate\nto the need for such interference;\n\n(iv) There must be procedural guarantees against abuse of\nsuch interference.”\n\nChelameswar, J.:\n\n377. It goes without saying that no legal right can be\nabsolute. Every right has limitations. This aspect of the\nmatter is conceded at the Bar. Therefore, even a\nfundamental right to privacy has limitations. The limitations\nare to be identified on case-to-case basis depending upon\nthe nature of the privacy interest claimed. There are\ndifferent standards of review to test infractions of\nfundamental rights. While the concept of reasonableness\noverarches Part III, it operates differently across Articles\n(even if only slightly differently across some of them).\n\nHaving emphatically interpreted the Constitution's liberty\nguarantee to contain a fundamental right to privacy, it is\nnecessary for me to outline the manner in which such a\nright to privacy can be limited. I only do this to indicate the\ndirection of the debate as the nature of limitation is not at\nissue here.\n\n378. To begin with, the options canvassed for limiting the\nright to privacy include an\nArticle 14\ntype reasonableness\nenquiry [A challenge under\nArticle 14\ncan be made if there\nis an unreasonable classification and/or if the impugned\nmeasure is arbitrary. The classification is unreasonable if\nthere is no intelligible differentia justifying the classification\nand if the classification has no rational nexus with the\nobjective sought to be achieved. Arbitrariness, which was\nfirst explained at para 85 of\nE.P. Royappa v. State of T.N.\n,\n(1974) 4 SCC 3 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 165 : AIR 1974 SC 555,\nis very simply the lack of any reasoning.] ; limitation as per\nthe express provisions of\nArticle 19;\na just, fair and\nreasonable basis (that is, substantive due process) for\nlimitation per\nArticle 21;\nand finally, a just, fair and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 162 of 567\n\nreasonable standard per\nArticle 21\nplus the amorphous\nstandard of “compelling State interest”.\nThe last of these\nfour options is the highest standard of scrutiny [ A tiered\nlevel of scrutiny was indicated in what came to be known\nas the most famous footnote in constitutional law, that is, fn\n4 in United States v. Carolene Products Co., 1938 SCC\nOnLine US SC 93 : 82 L Ed 1234 : 304 US 144 (1938).\nDepending on the graveness of the right at stake, the court\nadopts a correspondingly rigorous standard of scrutiny.]\nthat a court can adopt. It is from this menu that a standard\nof review for limiting the right to privacy needs to be\nchosen.\n\n379. At the very outset, if a privacy claim specifically flows\nonly from one of the expressly enumerated provisions\nunder\nArticle 19\n, then the standard of review would be as\nexpressly provided under\nArticle 19.\nHowever, the\npossibility of a privacy claim being entirely traceable to\nrights other than\nArticle 21\nis bleak. Without discounting\nthat possibility, it needs to be noted that\nArticle 21\nis the\nbedrock of the privacy guarantee. If the spirit of liberty\npermeates every claim of privacy, it is difficult, if not\nimpossible, to imagine that any standard of limitation other\nthan the one under\nArticle 21\napplies. It is for this reason\nthat I will restrict the available options to the latter two from\nthe above described four.\n\n380. The just, fair and reasonable standard of review under\n\nArticle 21\nneeds no elaboration. It has also most commonly\nbeen used in cases dealing with a privacy claim hitherto.\n[\nDistrict Registrar and Collector v. Canara Bank\n, (2005) 1\nSCC 496 :\nAIR 2005 SC 186] , [State of Maharashtra v.\nBharat Shanti Lal Shah\n, (2008) 13 SCC 5] Gobind [Gobind\nv. State of M.P., (1975) 2 SCC 148 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 468]\nresorted to the compelling State interest standard in\naddition to the\nArticle 21\nreasonableness enquiry. From the\nUnited States, where the terminology of “compelling State\ninterest” originated, a strict standard of scrutiny comprises\ntwo things—a “compelling State interest” and a\nrequirement of “narrow tailoring” (narrow tailoring means\nthat the law must be narrowly framed to achieve the\nobjective). As a term, “compelling State interest” does not\nhave definite contours in the US. Hence, it is critical that\nthis standard be adopted with some clarity as to when and\nin what types of privacy claimsit is to be used. Only in\nprivacy claims which deserve the strictest scrutiny is the\nstandard of compelling State interest to be used. As for\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 163 of 567\n\nothers, the just, fair and reasonable standard under\nArticle\nwill apply. When the compelling State interest standard\nis to be employed, must depend upon the context of\nconcrete cases. However, this discussion sets the ground\nrules within which a limitation for the right to privacy is to be\nfound.”\n\n82) In view of the aforesaid detailed discussion in all the opinions\n\npenned by six Hon’ble Judges, it stands established, without any\n\npale of doubt, that privacy has now been treated as part of\n\nfundamental rights. The Court has held, in no uncertain terms,\n\nthat privacy has always been a natural right which gives an\n\nindividual freedom to exercise control over his or her personality.\n\nThe judgment further affirms three aspects of the fundamental\n\nright to privacy, namely:\n\n(i) intrusion with an individual’s physical body;\n\n(ii) informational privacy; and\n\n(iii) privacy of choice.\n\n83) As succinctly put by Nariman, J. first aspect involves the person\n\nhimself/herself and guards a person’s rights relatable to his/her\n\nphysical body thereby controlling the uncalled invasion by the\n\nState. Insofar as the second aspect, namely, informational\n\nprivacy is concerned, it does not deal with a person’s body but\n\ndeals with a person’s mind. In this manner, it protects a person\n\nby giving her control over the dissemination of material that is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 164 of 567\n\npersonal to her and disallowing unauthorised use of such\n\ninformation by the State. Third aspect of privacy relates to\n\nindividual’s autonomy by protecting her fundamental personal\n\nchoices. These aspects have functional connection and\n\nrelationship with dignity. In this sense, privacy is a postulate of\n\nhuman dignity itself. Human dignity has a constitutional value\n\nand its significance is acknowledged by the Preamble. Further,\n\nby catena of judgments, human dignity is treated as a\n\nfundamental right and as a facet not only of\nArticle 21\nbut that of\n\nright to equality (\nArticle 14\n) and also part of bouquet of freedoms\n\nstipulated in\nArticle 19.\nTherefore, privacy as a right is intrinsic of\n\nfreedom, liberty and dignity. Viewed in this manner, one can\n\ntrace positive and negative contents of privacy. The negative\n\ncontent restricts the State from committing an intrusion upon the\n\nlife and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive content imposes\n\nan obligation on the State to take all necessary measures to\n\nprotect the privacy of the individual.\n\n84) A brief summation of the judgment on privacy would indicate that\n\nprivacy is treated as fundamental right. It is predicated on the\n\nbasis that privacy is a postulate of dignity and the concept of\n\ndignity can be traced to the preamble of the Constitution as well\n\nas\nArticle 21\nthereof. Further, privacy is considered as a subset\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 165 of 567\n\nof personal liberty thereby accepting the minority opinion in\n\nKharak Singh v. State of U.P. & Ors.29 Another\nsignificant\n\njurisprudential development of this judgment is that right to\n\nprivacy as a fundamental right is not limited to\nArticle 21.\nOn the\n\ncontrary, privacy resonates through the entirety of Part III of the\n\nConstitution which pertains to fundamental rights and, in\n\nparticular,\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21.\nPrivacy is also recognised as a\n\nnatural right which inheres in individuals and is, thus, inalienable.\n\nIn developing the aforesaid concepts, the Court has been\n\nreceptive to the principles in international law and international\n\ninstruments. It is a recognition of the fact that certain human\n\nrights cannot be confined within the bounds of geographical\n\nlocation of a nation but have universal application. In the\n\nprocess, the Court accepts the concept of universalisation of\n\nhuman rights, including the right to privacy as a human right and\n\nthe good practices in developing and understanding such rights in\n\nother countries have been welcomed. In this hue, it can also be\n\nremarked that comparative law has played a very significant role\n\nin shaping the aforesaid judgment on privacy in Indian context,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that such comparative law has only a\n\npersuasive value.\n\n29 AIR 1963 SC 1295\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 166 of 567\n\n85) The whole process of reasoning contained in different opinions of\n\nthe Hon’ble Judges would, thus, reflect that the argument that it is\n\ndifficult to precisely define the common denominator of privacy,\n\nwas rejected. While doing so, the Court referred to various\n\napproaches in formulating privacy30. An astute and sagacious\n\nanalysis of the judgment by the Centre for Internet and Society\n\nbrings about the following approaches which contributed to\n\nformulating the following right to privacy:\n\n(a) Classifying privacy on the basis of ‘harms’, thereby adopting\n\nthe approach conceptualised by Daniel Solove. In his book,\n\nUnderstanding Privacy31, Daniel Solove makes a case for privacy\n\nbeing a family resemblance concept.\n\n(b) Classifying privacy on the basis of ‘interests’: Gary\n\nBostwick’s taxonomy of privacy is among the most prominent\n\namongst the scholarship that sub-areas within the right to privacy\n\nprotect different ‘interests’ or ‘justifications’. This taxonomy is\n\nadopted in Chelameswar, J.’s definition of ‘privacy’ and includes\n\nthe three interests of privacy of repose, privacy of sanctuary and\n\nprivacy of intimate decision. Repose is the ‘right to be let alone’,\n\nsanctuary is the interest which prevents others from knowing,\n\n30 See the analysis of this judgment by the Centre for Internet and Society, https://cis-\nindia.org/internet-governance/blog/the-fundamental-right-to-privacy-an-analysis\n31 Daniel Solove, Understanding Privacy, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press,\n2008.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 167 of 567\n\nseeing and hearing thus keeping information within the private\n\nzone, and finally, privacy of intimate decision protects the\n\nfreedom to act autonomously.\n\n(c) Classifying privacy as an ‘aggregation of rights’: This\n\napproach in classifying privacy as a right, as highlighted above, is\n\nnot limited to one particular provision in the Chapter of\n\nFundamental Rights under the Constitution but is associated with\n\namalgam of different but connected rights. In formulating this\n\nprinciple, the Court has referred to scholars like Roger Clarke,\n\nAnita Allen etc. It has led to the recognition of private spaces or\n\nzones as protected under the right to privacy (thereby extending\n\nthe ambit and scope of spatial privacy), informational privacy and\n\ndecisional autonomy.\n\n86) The important question that arises, which is directly involved in\n\nthese cases, is:\n\nWhat is the scope of the right to privacy and in what\n\ncircumstances such a right can be limited?\n\n87) Concededly, fundamental rights are not absolute. The\n\nConstitution itself permits State to impose reasonable restrictions\n\non these rights under certain circumstances. Thus, extent and\n\nscope of the right to privacy and how and when it can be limited\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 168 of 567\n\nby the State actions is also to be discerned. As noted above,\n\nNariman, J. has led the path by observing that “when it comes to\n\nrestrictions on this right, the drill of various Articles to which the\n\nright relates must be scrupulously followed”. Therefore,\n\nexamination has to be from the point of view of\nArticles 14\n, 19\n\nand\nfor the reason that right to privacy is treated as having\n\nintimate connection to various rights in Part III and is not merely\n\nrelated to\nArticle 21.\nLooked from this angle, the action of the\n\nState will have to be tested on the touchstone of\nArticle 14.\nThis\n\njudgment clarifies that the ‘classification’ test adopted earlier has\n\nto be expanded and instead the law/action is to be tested on the\n\nground of ‘manifest arbitrariness’. This aspect has already been\n\ndiscussed in detail under the caption ‘Scope of Judicial Review’\n\nabove. When it comes to examining the ‘restrictions’ as per the\n\nprovisions of\nArticle 19\nof the Constitution, the judgment proceeds\n\nto clarify that a law which impacts dignity and liberty under\nArticle\n, as well as having chilling effects on free speech which is\n\nprotected by\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n, must satisfy the standards of judicial\n\nreview under both provisions. Therefore, such restriction must\n\nsatisfy the test of judicial review under: (i) one of the eight\n\ngrounds mentioned under\nArticle 19(2);\nand (ii) the restriction\n\nshould be reasonable. This Court has applied multiple standards\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 169 of 567\n\nto determine reasonableness, including proximity, arbitrariness,\n\nand proportionality. Further, the reasonable restrictions must be\n\nin the interests of: (i) the sovereignty and integrity of India, (ii) the\n\nsecurity of the State, (iii) friendly relations with foreign States, (iv)\n\npublic order, (v) decency or morality or (vi) in relation to contempt\n\nof court, (vii) defamation or (viii) incitement to an offence.\n\n88) The judgment further lays down that in the context of\nArticle 21\n,\n\nthe test to be applied while examining a particular provision is the\n\n‘just, fair and reasonable test’ thereby bringing notion of\n\nproportionality.\n\n89) The petitioners have sought to build their case on the aforesaid\n\nparameters of privacy and have submitted that this right of\n\nprivacy, which is now recognised as a fundamental right, stands\n\nviolated by the very fabric contained in the scheme of Aadhaar. It\n\nis sought to be highlighted that the data which is collected by the\n\nState, particularly with the authentication of each transaction\n\nentered into by an individual, can be assimilated to construct a\n\nprofile of such an individual and it particularly violates\n\ninformational privacy. No doubt, there can be reasonable\n\nrestrictions on this right, which is conceded by the petitioners. It\n\nis, however, argued that right to privacy cannot be impinged\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 170 of 567\n\nwithout a just, fair and reasonable law. Therefore, in the first\n\ninstance, any intrusion into the privacy of a person has to be\n\nbacked by a law. Further, such a law, to be valid, has to pass the\n\ntest of legitimate aim which it should serve and also\n\nproportionality i.e. proportionate to the need for such interference.\n\nNot only this, the law in question must also provide procedural\n\nguarantees against abuse of such interference.\n\n90) At the same time, it can also be deduced from the reading of the\n\naforesaid judgment that the reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nmay vary from the intimate zone to the private zone and from the\n\nprivate zone to the public arena. Further, privacy is not lost or\n\nsurrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.\n\nFor example, if a person was to post on Facebook vital\n\ninformation about himself, the same being in public domain, he\n\nwould not be entitled to claim privacy right. This aspect is\n\nhighlighted by some of the Hon’ble Judges as under:\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.:\n\n“297. What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy\npostulates the reservation of a private space for the\nindividual, described as the right to be let alone. The\nconcept is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The\nability of an individual to make choices lies at the core of\nthe human personality. The notion of privacy enables the\nindividual to assert and control the human element which is\ninseparable from the personality of the individual. The\ninviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 171 of 567\n\nthe ability to make decisions on matters intimate to human\nlife. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\nmatters which can be kept private. These are concerns\nover which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The\nbody and the mind are inseparable elements of the human\npersonality. The integrity of the body and the sanctity of the\nmind can exist on the foundation that each individual\npossesses an inalienable ability and right to preserve a\nprivate space in which the human personality can develop.\nWithout the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the\npersonality would be in doubt. Recognising a zone of\nprivacy is but an acknowledgment that each individual must\nbe entitled to chart and pursue the course of development\nof personality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human\ndignity itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which are\nintimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of privacy\nwhere one is free of social expectations. In that zone of\nprivacy, an individual is not judged by others. Privacy\nenables each individual to take crucial decisions which find\nexpression in the human personality. It enables individuals\nto preserve their beliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas,\nideologies, preferences and choices against societal\ndemands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition\nof heterogeneity, of the right of the individual to be different\nand to stand against the tide of conformity in creating a\nzone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the\nsearching glare of publicity in matters which are personal to\nhis or her life. Privacy attaches to the person and not to the\nplace where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the\nfoundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that the\nindividual can decide how liberty is best exercised.\nIndividual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a\npattern woven out of a thread of diversity into the fabric of a\nplural culture.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n299. Privacy represents the core of the human personality\nand recognises the ability of each individual to make\nchoices and to take decisions governing matters intimate\nand personal. Yet, it is necessary to acknowledge that\nindividuals live in communities and work in communities.\n\nTheir personalities affect and, in turn are shaped by their\nsocial environment. The individual is not a hermit. The lives\nof individuals are as much a social phenomenon. In their\ninteractions with others, individuals are constantly engaged\nin behavioural patterns and in relationships impacting on\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 172 of 567\n\nthe rest of society. Equally, the life of the individual is being\nconsistently shaped by cultural and social values imbibed\nfrom living in the community. This state of flux which\nrepresents a constant evolution of individual personhood in\nthe relationship with the rest of society provides the\nrationale for reserving to the individual a zone of repose.\nThe lives which individuals lead as members of society\nengender a reasonable expectation of privacy. The notion\nof a reasonable expectation of privacy has elements both\nof a subjective and objective nature. Privacy at a subjective\nlevel is a reflection of those areas where an individual\ndesires to be left alone. On an objective plane, privacy is\ndefined by those constitutional values which shape the\ncontent of the protected zone where the individual ought to\nbe left alone. The notion that there must exist a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy ensures that while on the one hand,\nthe individual has a protected zone of privacy, yet on the\nother, the exercise of individual choices is subject to the\nrights of others to lead orderly lives. For instance, an\nindividual who possesses a plot of land may decide to build\nupon it subject to zoning regulations. If the building bye-\nlaws define the area upon which construction can be raised\nor the height of the boundary wall around the property, the\nright to privacy of the individual is conditioned by\nregulations designed to protect the interests of the\ncommunity in planned spaces. Hence while the individual is\nentitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only on\nthe subjective expectation of the individual but on an\nobjective principle which defines a reasonable expectation.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n307. The sphere of privacy stretches at one end to those\nintimate matters to which a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy may attach. It expresses a right to be left alone. A\nbroader connotation which has emerged in academic\nliterature of a comparatively recent origin is related to the\nprotection of one's identity. Data protection relates closely\nwith the latter sphere. Data such as medical information\nwould be a category to which a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy attaches. There may be other data which falls\noutside the reasonable expectation paradigm. Apart from\nsafeguarding privacy, data protection regimes seek to\nprotect the autonomy of the individual. This is evident from\nthe emphasis in the European data protection regime on\nthe centrality of consent. Related to the issue of consent is\nthe requirement of transparency which requires a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 173 of 567\n\ndisclosure by the data recipient of information pertaining to\ndata transfer and use.”\n\nS.A. Bobde, J:\n\n“421. Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the State of\nGujarat, while referring to several judgments of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, submitted that only\nthose privacy claims which involve a “reasonable\nexpectation of privacy” be recognised as protected by the\nfundamental right. It is not necessary for the purpose of this\ncase to deal with the particular instances of privacy claims\nwhich are to be recognised as implicating a fundamental\nright. Indeed, it would be premature to do so. The scope\nand ambit of a constitutional protection of privacy can only\nbe revealed to us on a case-by-case basis.”\n\n91) Though Nariman, J. did not subscribe to the aforesaid view in\n\ntotality, however, His Lordship has also given an example that if a\n\nperson has to post on Facebook vital information, the same being\n\nin public domain, she would not be entitled to the claim of privacy\n\nright.\n\n92) We would also like to reproduce following discussion, in the\n\nopinion authored by Nariman, J., giving the guidance as to how a\n\nlaw has to be tested when it is challenged on the ground that it\n\nviolates the fundamental right to privacy:\n\n“...Statutory provisions that deal with aspects of privacy would\ncontinue to be tested on the ground that they would violate the\nfundamental right to privacy, and would not be struck down, if it\nis found on a balancing test that the social or public interest and\nthe reasonableness of the restrictions would outweigh the\nparticular aspect of privacy claimed. If this is so, then statutes\nwhich would enable the State to contractually obtain information\nabout persons would pass muster in given circumstances,\nprovided they safeguard the individual right to privacy as well. A\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 174 of 567\n\nsimple example would suffice. If a person was to paste on\nFacebook vital information about himself/herself, such\ninformation, being in the public domain, could not possibly be\nclaimed as a privacy right after such disclosure. But, in\npursuance of a statutory requirement, if certain details need to\nbe given for the statutory purpose concerned, then such details\nwould certainly affect the right to privacy, but would on a\nbalance, pass muster as the State action concerned has\nsufficient inbuilt safeguards to protect this right—viz. the fact\nthat such information cannot be disseminated to anyone else,\nsave on compelling grounds of public interest.”\n\n93) One important comment which needs to be made at this stage\n\nrelates to the standard of judicial review while examining the\n\nvalidity of a particular law that allegedly infringes right to privacy.\n\nThe question is as to whether the Court is to apply ‘strict scrutiny’\n\nstandard or the ‘just, fair and reasonableness’ standard. In the\n\nprivacy judgment, different observations are made by different\n\nHon’ble Judges and the aforesaid aspect is not determined\n\nauthoritatively, may be for the reason that the Bench was\n\ndeciding the reference on the issue as to whether right to privacy\n\nis a fundamental right or not and, in the process, it was called\n\nupon to decide the specific questions referred to it. We have\n\ndealt with this aspect at the appropriate stage.\n\nPrinciples of Human Dignity:\n\n94) While undertaking the analysis of the judgment in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy, we have mentioned that one of the attributes laid\n\ndown therein is that the sanctity of privacy lies in its functional\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 175 of 567\n\nrelationship with dignity. Privacy is the constitutional core of\n\nhuman dignity. In the context of Aadhaar scheme how the\n\nconcept of human dignity is to be applied assumes significance.\n\n95) In\nCommon Cause v. Union of India32\n, the concept of human\n\ndignity has been explained in much detail 33. The concept of\n\nhuman dignity developed in\nthe said judgment\nwas general in\n\nnature which is based on right to autonomy and right of choice\n\nand it has become a constitutional value. In the last 40 years or\n\nso, this Court has given many landmark judgments wherein\n\nconcept of human dignity is recognised as an attribute of\n\nfundamental rights. In the earlier years, though the meaning and\n\nscope of human dignity by itself was not expanded, this exercise\n\nhas been undertaken in last few years. Earlier judgments have\n\nmentioned that human dignity is the intrinsic value of every\n\nhuman being and, in the process, a person’s autonomy as an\n\nattribute of dignity stands recognised. The judgments rendered in\n\nthe last few years have attempted to provide jurisprudential basis\n\nto the concept of human dignity itself.\n\n96) In\nNational Legal Services Authority v. Union of India & Ors.\nwhile recognising the right of transgenders of self determination\n\n32 (2018) 5 SCC 1\n33 See paras 72-79 of the judgment\n34 (2014) 5 SCC 438\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 176 of 567\n\nof their sex, the Court explained the contours of human dignity in\n\nthe following words:\n\n“106. The basic principle of the dignity and freedom of the\nindividual is common to all nations, particularly those\nhaving democratic set up. Democracy requires us to\nrespect and develop the free spirit of human being which is\nresponsible for all progress in human history. Democracy\nis also a method by which we attempt to raise the living\nstandard of the people and to give opportunities to every\nperson to develop his/her personality. It is founded on\npeaceful co-existence and cooperative living. If democracy\nis based on the recognition of the individuality and dignity\nof man, as a fortiori we have to recognize the right of a\nhuman being to choose his sex/gender identity which is\nintegral to his/her personality and is one of the most basic\naspect of self-determination, dignity and freedom. In fact,\nthere is a growing recognition that the true measure of\ndevelopment of a nation is not economic growth; it is\nhuman dignity.\n\n107. More than 225 years ago, Immanuel Kant\npropounded the doctrine of free will, namely, the free willing\nindividual as a natural law ideal. Without going into the\ndetailed analysis of his aforesaid theory of justice (as we\nare not concerned with the analysis of his jurisprudence)\nwhat we want to point out is his emphasis on the “freedom”\nof human volition. The concepts of volition and freedom are\n“pure”, that is not drawn from experience. They are\nindependent of any particular body of moral or legal rules.\n\nThey are presuppositions of all such rules, valid and\nnecessary for all of them.\n\n108. Over a period of time, two divergent interpretations of\nthe Kantian criterion of justice came to be discussed. One\ntrend was an increasing stress on the maximum of\nindividual freedom of action as the end of law. This may not\nbe accepted and was criticised by the protagonist of\n“hedonist utilitarianism”, notably Bentham. This school of\nthought laid emphasis on the welfare of the society rather\nthan an individual by propounding the principle of\nmaximum of happiness to most of the people. Fortunately,\nin the instant case, there is no such dichotomy between the\nindividual freedom/liberty we are discussing, as against\npublic good. On the contrary, granting the right to choose\ngender leads to public good. The second tendency of the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 177 of 567\n\nKantian criterion of justice was found in reinterpreting\n“freedom” in terms not merely of absence of restraint\nbut in terms of attainment of individual perfection. It is\nthis latter trend with which we are concerned in the present\ncase and this holds good even today. As pointed out\nabove, after the Second World War, in the form of the UN\nCharter and thereafter there is more emphasis on the\nattainment of individual perfection. In that united sense at\nleast there is a revival of the natural law theory of justice.\nBlackstone, in the opening pages in his “Vattelian Fashion”\nsaid that the principal aim of society “is to protect\nindividuals in the enjoyment of those absolute rights which\nwere vested in them by the immutable laws of nature….”\n\n97) Thus, right of choice and right of self determination were\n\naccepted as facets of human dignity. It was also emphasised that\n\nin certain cases, like the case at hand (that of transgenders),\n\nrecognition of this aspect of human dignity would yield happiness\n\nto the individuals and, at the same time, also be in public good.\n\n98) Advancement in conceptualising the doctrine of human dignity\n\ntook place in the case of\nShabnam v. Union of India & Ors.\nwherein this Court has gone to the extent of protecting certain\n\nrights of death convicts by holding that they cannot be executed\n\ntill they exhaust all available constitutional and statutory\n\nremedies. In the process, the Court held as under:\n\n““15. This right to human dignity has many elements. First\nand foremost, human dignity is the dignity of each human\nbeing 'as a human being'. Another element, which needs\nto be highlighted, in the context of the present case, is that\nhuman dignity is infringed if a person's life, physical or\nmental welfare is harmed. It is in this sense torture,\n\n35 (2015) 6 SCC 702\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 178 of 567\n\nhumiliation, forced labour, etc. all infringe on human dignity.\n\nIt is in this context many rights of the accused derive from\nhis dignity as a human being. These may include the\npresumption that every person is innocent until proven\nguilty; the right of the accused to a fair trial as well as\nspeedy trial; right of legal aid, all part of human dignity.\nEven after conviction, when a person is spending prison\nlife, allowing humane conditions in jail is part of human\ndignity. Prisons reforms or Jail reforms measures to make\nconvicts a reformed person so that they are able to lead\nnormal life and assimilate in the society, after serving the\njail term, are motivated by human dignity jurisprudence.\n\n16. In fact, this principle of human dignity has been used\nfrequently by Courts in the context of considering the death\npenalty itself. Way back in the year 1972, the United States\nSupreme Court kept in mind this aspect in the case of\nFurman v. Georgia 408 US 238 (1972). The Court,\nspeaking through Brennan, J., while considering the\napplication of Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and\nunusual punishments, summed up the previous\njurisprudence on the Amendment as 'prohibit(ing) the\ninfliction of uncivilized and inhuman punishments. The\nState, even as it punishes, must treat its members with\nrespect for their intrinsic worth as human beings. A\npunishment is 'cruel and unusual', therefore, if it does not\ncomport with human dignity'. In Gregg v. Georgia 428 US\n153 (1976), that very Court, again through Brennan, J.,\nconsidered that 'the fatal constitutional infirmity in the\npunishment of death is that it treats “members of the\nhuman race as non-humans, as objects to be toyed with an\ndiscarded. (It is), thus, inconsistent with the fundamental\npremise of the clause that even the vilest criminal remains\na human being possessed of common human dignity'. The\nCanadian Supreme Court, the Hungarian Constitutional\nCourt and the South African Supreme Court have gone to\nthe extent of holding that capital punishment constitutes a\nserious impairment of human dignity and imposes a\nlimitation on the essential content of the fundamental rights\nto life and human dignity and on that touchstone declaring\nthat dignity as unconstitutional.”\n\n99) Next judgment in this line of cases would be that of\nJeeja Ghosh\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 179 of 567\n\n& Another v. Union of India & Ors.36\nwherein the Court, while\n\nexpanding the jurisprudential basis, outlined three models of\n\ndignity which have been discussed by us above. These were\n\nreferred to while explaining the normative role of human dignity,\n\nalongside, in the following manner:\n\n“37. The rights that are guaranteed to differently-abled\npersons under the 1995 Act, are founded on the sound\nprinciple of human dignity which is the core value of human\nright and is treated as a significant facet of right to life and\nliberty. Such a right, now treated as human right of the\npersons who are disabled, has it roots in\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution. Jurisprudentially, three types of models for\ndetermining the content of the constitutional value of\nhuman dignity are recognised. These are: (i) Theological\nModels, (ii) Philosophical Models, and (iii) Constitutional\nModels. Legal scholars were called upon to determine the\ntheological basis of human dignity as a constitutional value\nand as a constitutional right. Philosophers also came out\nwith their views justifying human dignity as core human\nvalue. Legal understanding is influenced by theological and\nphilosophical views, though these two are not identical.\nAquinas and Kant discussed the jurisprudential aspects of\nhuman dignity based on the aforesaid philosophies. Over a\nperiod of time, human dignity has found its way through\nconstitutionalism, whether written or unwritten. Even right\nto equality is interpreted based on the value of human\ndignity. Insofar as India is concerned, we are not even\nrequired to take shelter under theological or philosophical\ntheories. We have a written Constitution which guarantees\nhuman rights that are contained in Part III with the caption\n“Fundamental Rights”. One such right enshrined in\nArticle\nis right to life and liberty. Right to life is given a\npurposeful meaning by this Court to include right to live\nwith dignity. It is the purposive interpretation which has\nbeen adopted by this Court to give a content of the right to\nhuman dignity as the fulfilment of the constitutional value\nenshrined in\nArticle 21.\nThus, human dignity is a\nconstitutional value and a constitutional goal. What are the\ndimensions of constitutional value of human dignity? It is\n\n36 (2016) 7 SCC 761\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 180 of 567\n\nbeautifully illustrated by Aharon Barak (former Chief Justice\nof the Supreme Court of Israel) in the following manner:\n\n“The constitutional value of human dignity has a\ncentral normative role. Human dignity as a\nconstitutional value is the factor that unites the human\nrights into one whole. It ensures the normative unity\nof human rights. This normative unity is expressed in\nthe three ways: first, the value of human dignity\nserves as a normative basis for constitutional rights\nset out in the Constitution; second, it serves as an\ninterpretative principle for determining the scope of\nconstitutional rights, including the right to human\ndignity; third, the value of human dignity has an\nimportant role in determining the proportionality of a\nstatute limiting a constitutional right.”\n\n38. All the three goals of human dignity as a constitutional\nvalue are expanded by the author in a scholarly manner.\n\nSome of the excerpts thereof, are reproduced below which\ngive a glimpse of these goals:\n\n“The first role of human dignity as a constitutional\nvalue is expressed in the approach that it comprises\nthe foundation for all of the constitutional rights.\nHuman dignity is the central argument for the\nexistence of human rights. It is the rationale for them\nall. It is the justification for the existence of rights.\nAccording to Christoph Enders, it is the constitutional\nvalue that determines that every person has the right\nto have rights…\n\nThe second role of human dignity as a constitutional\nvalue is to provide meaning to the norms of the legal\nsystem. According to purposive interpretation, all of\nthe provisions of the Constitution, and particularly all\nof the rights in the constitutional bill of rights, are\ninterpreted in light of human dignity…\n\nLastly, human dignity as a constitutional value\ninfluences the development of the common law.\nIndeed, where common law is recognised, Judges\nhave the duty to develop it, and if necessary, modify\nit, so that it expresses constitutional values, including\nthe constitutional value of human dignity. To the\nextent that common law determines rights and duties\nbetween individuals, it might limit the human dignity of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 181 of 567\n\none individual and protect the human dignity of the\nother.”\n\n100) The concept was developed and expanded further in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy. The Court held that privacy postulates the\n\nreservation of a private space for an individual, described as the\n\nright to be let alone, as a concept founded on autonomy of the\n\nindividual. In this way, right to privacy has been treated as a\n\npostulate of human dignity itself. While defining so, the Court\n\nalso remarked as under:\n\n“298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of\ndignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental value.\nAs an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement or a\nconstitutionally protected interest in itself. In its\ninstrumental facet, dignity and freedom are inseparably\nintertwined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the\nother. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of\nprivacy enables the realisation of the full value of life and\nliberty... The family, marriage, procreation and sexual\norientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual.\nAbove all, the privacy of the individual recognises an\ninviolable right to determine how freedom shall be\nexercised...”\n\n101) This concept of dignity took a leap forwarded in the case of\n\nCommon Cause v. Union of India37\npertaining to passive\n\neuthanasia.\n\nThough this right was earlier recognised in\nAruna\n\nRamachandra Shanbaug v. Union of India & Ors.38\n, a totally new\n\ndimension was given to this right, based on freedom of choice\n\n37 (2018) 5 SCC 1\n38 (2011) 4 SCC 454\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 182 of 567\n\nwhich is to be given to an individual accepting his dignity. There\n\nwere four concurring opinions. In one of the opinions 39, the\n\naspects of dignity are succinctly brought out in the following\n\nmanner:\n\n“154. Dignity of an individual has been internationally\nrecognised as an important facet of human rights in the\nyear 1948 itself with the enactment of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Human dignity not only finds\nplace in the Preamble of this important document but also\nin\nArticle 1\nof the same. It is well known that the principles\nset out in UDHR are of paramount importance and are\ngiven utmost weightage while interpreting human rights all\nover the world. The first and foremost responsibility fixed\nupon the State is the protection of human dignity without\nwhich any other right would fall apart. Justice Brennan in\nhis book The Constitution of the United States:\n\nContemporary Ratification has referred to the Constitution\nas “a sparkling vision of the supremacy of the human\ndignity of every individual”.\n\n155. In fact, in Christine Goodwin v. United Kingdom the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights, speaking in the context\nof the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms, has gone to the extent of stating\nthat “the very essence of the Convention is respect for\nhuman dignity and human freedom”. In the South African\ncase of S. v. Makwanyane, O’Regan, J. stated in the\nConstitutional Court that “without dignity, human life is\nsubstantially diminished”.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n157. The concept and value of dignity requires further\nelaboration since we are treating it as an inextricable facet\nof right to life that respects all human rights that a person\nenjoys. Life is basically self-assertion. In the life of a\nperson, conflict and dilemma are expected to be normal\nphenomena. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in one of his\naddresses, quoted a line from a Latin poet who had uttered\nthe message, “Death plucks my ear and says, Live—I am\ncoming”. That is the significance of living. But when a\n39 Rendered by Dipak Misra, CJI\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 183 of 567\n\npatient really does not know if he/she is living till death\nvisits him/her and there is constant suffering without any\nhope of living, should one be allowed to wait? Should\nshe/he be cursed to die as life gradually ebbs out from\nher/his being? Should she/he live because of innovative\nmedical technology or, for that matter, should he/she\ncontinue to live with the support system as people around\nhim/her think that science in its progressive invention may\nbring about an innovative method of cure? To put it\ndifferently, should he/she be “Guinea pig” for some kind of\nexperiment? The answer has to be an emphatic “No”\nbecause such futile waiting mars the pristine concept of\nlife, corrodes the essence of dignity and erodes the fact of\neventual choice which is pivotal to privacy.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n159.\nIn\nMehmood Nayyar Azam v. State of Chhattisgarh\n, a\ntwo-Judge Bench held thus: (SCC p. 6, para 1)\n\n“1. … Albert Schweitzer, highlighting on Glory of Life,\npronounced with conviction and humility, “the\nreverence of life offers me my fundamental principle\non morality”. The aforesaid expression may appear to\nbe an individualistic expression of a great personality,\nbut, when it is understood in the complete sense, it\nreally denotes, in its conceptual essentiality, and\nconnotes, in its macrocosm, the fundamental\nperception of a thinker about the respect that life\ncommands. The reverence of life is insegregably\nassociated with the dignity of a human being who is\nbasically divine, not servile. A human personality is\nendowed with potential infinity and it blossoms when\ndignity is sustained. The sustenance of such dignity\nhas to be the superlative concern of every sensitive\nsoul. The essence of dignity can never be treated as\na momentary spark of light or, for that matter, “a brief\ncandle”, or “a hollow bubble”.\nThe spark of life gets\nmore resplendent when man is treated with dignity\nsans humiliation, for every man is expected to lead an\nhonourable life which is a splendid gift of “creative\nintelligence”.”\n\nxx xx xx\n\n166. The purpose of saying so is only to highlight that the\nlaw must take cognizance of the changing society and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 184 of 567\n\nmarch in consonance with the developing concepts. The\nneed of the present has to be served with the interpretative\nprocess of law. However, it is to be seen how much\nstrength and sanction can be drawn from the Constitution\nto consummate the changing ideology and convert it into a\nreality. The immediate needs are required to be addressed\nthrough the process of interpretation by the Court unless\nthe same totally falls outside the constitutional framework\nor the constitutional interpretation fails to recognise such\ndynamism. The Constitution Bench in\nGian Kaur [Gian\nKaur v. State of Punjab\n, (1996) 2 SCC 648 : 1996 SCC\n(Cri) 374] , as stated earlier, distinguishes attempt to\nsuicide and abetment of suicide from acceleration of the\nprocess of natural death which has commenced. The\nauthorities, we have noted from other jurisdictions, have\nobserved the distinctions between the administration of\nlethal injection or certain medicines to cause painless\ndeath and non-administration of certain treatment which\ncan prolong the life in cases where the process of dying\nthat has commenced is not reversible or withdrawal of the\ntreatment that has been given to the patient because of the\nabsolute absence of possibility of saving the life. To\nexplicate, the first part relates to an overt act whereas the\nsecond one would come within the sphere of informed\nconsent and authorised omission. The omission of such a\nnature will not invite any criminal liability if such action is\nguided by certain safeguards. The concept is based on\nnon-prolongation of life where there is no cure for the state\nthe patient is in and he, under no circumstances, would\nhave liked to have such a degrading state. The words “no\ncure” have to be understood to convey that the patient\nremains in the same state of pain and suffering or the dying\nprocess is delayed by means of taking recourse to modern\nmedical technology. It is a state where the treating\nphysicians and the family members know fully well that the\ntreatment is administered only to procrastinate the\ncontinuum of breath of the individual and the patient is not\neven aware that he is breathing. Life is measured by\nartificial heartbeats and the patient has to go through this\nundignified state which is imposed on him. The dignity of\nlife is denied to him as there is no other choice but to suffer\nan avoidable protracted treatment thereby thus indubitably\ncasting a cloud and creating a dent in his right to live with\ndignity and face death with dignity, which is a preserved\nconcept of bodily autonomy and right to privacy. In such a\nstage, he has no old memories or any future hopes but he\nis in a state of misery which nobody ever desires to have.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 185 of 567\n\nSome may also silently think that death, the inevitable\nfactum of life, cannot be invited. To meet such situations,\nthe Court has a duty to interpret\nArticle 21\nin a further\ndynamic manner and it has to be stated without any trace\nof doubt that the right to life with dignity has to include the\nsmoothening of the process of dying when the person is in\na vegetative state or is living exclusively by the\nadministration of artificial aid that prolongs the life by\narresting the dignified and inevitable process of dying.\nHere, the issue of choice also comes in. Thus analysed, we\nare disposed to think that such a right would come within\nthe ambit of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.”\n\n102) In the other opinion40, four facets of euthanasia were discussed,\n\nnamely: (i) philosophy of euthanasia, (ii) morality of euthanasia,\n\n(iii) dignity in euthanasia, and (iv) economics of euthanasia.\n\nWhile discussing dignity in euthanasia, the three models of\n\ndignity, namely, theological, philosophical and constitutional\n\nmodel, were highlighted. Thereafter, postulates of dignity have\n\nbeen explained in the following manner:\n\n“292. Aharon Barak, former Chief Justice of the Supreme\nCourt of Israel, attributes two roles to the concept of human\ndignity as a constitutional value, which are:\n\n292.1. Human dignity lays a foundation for all the human\nrights as it is the central argument for the existence of\nhuman rights.\n\n292.2. Human dignity as a constitutional value provides\nmeaning to the norms of the legal system. In the process,\none can discern that the principle of purposive\ninterpretation exhorts us to interpret all the rights given by\nthe Constitution, in the light of the human dignity. In this\nsense, human dignity influences the purposive\ninterpretation of the Constitution. Not only this, it also\ninfluences the interpretation of every sub-constitutional\nnorm in the legal system. Moreover, human dignity as a\n40 Rendered by A.K. Sikri, J.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 186 of 567\n\nconstitutional value also influences the development of the\ncommon law.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n295. Dworkin, being a philosopher-jurist, was aware of the\nidea of a Constitution and of a constitutional right to human\ndignity. In his book, Taking Rights Seriously, he noted that\neveryone who takes rights seriously must give an answer\nto the question why human rights vis-à-vis the State exist.\nAccording to him, in order to give such an answer one must\naccept, as a minimum, the idea of human dignity. As he\nwrites:\n\n“Human dignity … associated with Kant, but defended\nby philosophers of different schools, supposes that\nthere are ways of treating a man that are inconsistent\nwith recognising him as a full member of the human\ncommunity, and holds that such treatment is\nprofoundly unjust.”41\n\n296. In his Book, Is Democracy Possible Here?42 Dworkin\ndevelops two principles about the concept of human\ndignity. First principle regards the intrinsic value of every\nperson viz. every person has a special objective value\nwhich value is not only important to that person alone but\nsuccess or failure of the lives of every person is important\nto all of us. The second principle, according to Dworkin, is\nthat of personal responsibility. According to this principle,\nevery person has the responsibility for success in his own\nlife and, therefore, he must use his discretion regarding the\nway of life that will be successful from his point of view.\nThus, Dworkin's jurisprudence of human dignity is founded\non the aforesaid two principles which, together, not only\ndefine the basis but the conditions for human dignity.\nDworkin went on to develop and expand these principles in\nhis book, Justice for Hedgehogs (2011)43.\n\n297. When speaking of rights, it is impossible to envisage\nit without dignity. In his pioneering and all-inclusive Justice\nfor Hedgehogs, he proffered an approach where respect\nfor human dignity, entails two requirements; first, self-\nrespect i.e. taking the objective importance of one's own\n\n41 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (A&C Black, 2013) 239.\n42 Ronald Dworkin, Is Democracy Possible Here? Principles for a New Political Debate (Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2006)\n43 Harvard University Press, 2011.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 187 of 567\n\nlife seriously; this represents the free will of the person, his\ncapacity to think for himself and to control his own life and\nsecond, authenticity i.e. accepting a “special, personal\nresponsibility for identifying what counts as success” in\none's own life and for creating that life “through a coherent\nnarrative” that one has chosen44. According to Dworkin,\nthese principles form the fundamental criteria supervising\nwhat we should do in order to live well.45 They further\nexplicate the rights that individuals have against their\npolitical community,46 and they provide a rationale for the\nmoral duties we owe to others. This notion of dignity, which\nDworkin gives utmost importance to, is indispensable to\nany civilised society. It is what is constitutionally recognised\nin our country and for good reason. Living well is a moral\nresponsibility of individuals; it is a continuing process that is\nnot a static condition of character but a mode that an\nindividual constantly endeavours to imbibe. A life lived\nwithout dignity, is not a life lived at all for living well implies\na conception of human dignity which Dworkin interprets\nincludes ideals of self-respect and authenticity.”\n\n103) In summation, it can be said that the concept of human dignity\n\ndates back to thousands of years. Historically, human dignity, as\n\na concept, found its origin in different religions which is held to be\n\nan important component of their theological approach. Jurists\n\nhave given this approach as ‘theological model’ of dignity. It is\n\nprimarily based on the premise that human beings are the\n\ncreation of God and cannot be treated as mere material beings.\n\nHuman identity is more ethical than spiritual because man is\n\ncreation of God; harm to a human being is harm to God. God,\n\nthus, wishes to grant human being recognition, dignity and\n\n44 Kenneth W. Simons, “Dworkin's Two Principle of Dignity: An Unsatisfactory Non-\nConsequentialist Account of Interpersonal Moral Duties”, 90 Boston Law Rev. 715 (2010)]\n45 Footnote 33 above.\n\n46 Footnote 32 above.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 188 of 567\n\nauthority. It is also religious belief that God is rational and\n\ndetermines his goals for himself. Likewise, human being created\n\nby God too is rational and determines his own goal. Therefore,\n\nman has freedom of will. A couple of centuries ago, philosophical\n\napproach was given to the conception of human dignity. This\n\nsphere was headed by German Philosopher Immanuel Kant\n\nwhose moral theory is divided into two parts: ethics and right.\n\nAccording to Kant, a person acts ethically when he acts by force\n\nof a duty that a rational agent self-legislates onto his own will.\n\nThus, he talked of free will of the human being. For Kant, ethics\n\ninclude duties of oneself (for example - to develop one's talents)\n\nand to others (for example - to contribute to their happiness).\n\nThis ability is the human dignity of man. Philosophical approach,\n\nthus, is metaethical one, which is a journey from ‘human being’\n\nand ‘remaining human’. This is explained by Professor Upendra\n\nBaxi as the relationship between ‘self’, ‘others’ and ‘society’. In\n\nthis philosophical sense, dignity is ‘respect’ for an individual\n\nperson based on the principle of freedom and capacity of making\n\nchoices and a good or just social order is one which respects\n\ndignity via assuring ‘contexts’ and ‘conditions’ as the ‘source of\n\nfree and informed choice’. To put it philosophically, each\n\nindividual has a right to live her life the way she wants, without\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 189 of 567\n\nany subjugation. One can rule others, but then it is never noble.\n\nIt is immoral because the other is not a means to you, the other is\n\nan end to herself. Kant also maintains that to use the other as a\n\nmeans is the basic immoral act. Everything else that is immoral\n\nis immoral because of this, so this should be the criterion: Are\n\nyou using the other as a means? Someone has put this\n\nremarkably in the following words:\n\n“Alexander the Great is not noble, only Gautam the Buddha\nis noble, for the simple reason that Buddha has no rule\nover others but he is a matter of himself.\n\nThere is no part of his being which is not in tune with him.\nHe has come to attain absolute harmony. There is no\nconflict in him, there is a reign of absolute peace. And his\nconsciousness is supreme, nothing is above it – no instinct,\nno intellect, nothing is higher than his consciousness.”\n\n104) Historically, a transition has taken place into the idea of dignity by\n\ntransforming the amalgam of theological approach (man as\n\ncreation of God deserving dignity) and philosophical approach\n\nbased on morality, by elevating human dignity as a constitutional\n\nnorm attaching constitutional value to it. It is a transition from\n\n‘respect’ to ‘right’ by making respect as enforceable right. The\n\nmanner in which it has happened in India has been traced above.\n\n105) From the aforesaid discussion, it follows that dignity as a\n\njurisprudential concept has now been well defined by this Court.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 190 of 567\n\nIts essential ingredients can be summarised as under:\n\nThe basic principle of dignity and freedom of the individual\n\nis an attribute of natural law which becomes the right of all\n\nindividuals in a constitutional democracy. Dignity has a central\n\nnormative role as well as constitutional value. This normative role\n\nis performed in three ways:\n\nFirst, it becomes basis for constitutional rights;\n\nSecond, it serves as an interpretative principle for\n\ndetermining the scope of constitutional rights; and,\n\nThird, it determines the proportionality of a statute limiting a\n\nconstitutional right. Thus, if an enactment puts limitation on a\n\nconstitutional right and such limitation is disproportionate, such a\n\nstatute can be held to be unconstitutional by applying the doctrine\n\nof proportionality.\n\n106) As per Dworkin, there are two principles about the concept of\n\nhuman dignity. First principle regards an ‘intrinsic value’ of every\n\nperson, namely, every person has a special objective value,\n\nwhich value is not only important to that person alone but\n\nsuccess or failure of the lives of every person is important to all of\n\nus. It can also be described as self respect which represents the\n\nfree will of the person, her capacity to think for herself and to\n\ncontrol her own life. The second principle is that of ‘personal\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 191 of 567\n\nresponsibility’, which means every person has the responsibility\n\nfor success in her own life and, therefore, she must use her\n\ndiscretion regarding the way of life that will be successful from\n\nher point of view.\n\n107) Sum total of this exposition is well defined by Professor Baxi by\n\nexplaining that as per the aforesaid view, dignity is to be treated\n\nas ‘empowerment’ which makes a triple demand in the name of\n\n‘respect’ for human dignity, namely:\n\n(i) respect for one's capacity as an agent to make one's own free\n\nchoices;\n\n(ii) respect for the choices so made; and\n\n(iii) respect for one's need to have a context and conditions in\n\nwhich one can operate as a source of free and informed choice.\n\n108) In this entire formulation, ‘respect’ for an individual is the fulcrum,\n\nwhich is based on the principle of freedom and capacity to make\n\nchoices and a good or just social order is one which respects\n\ndignity via assuring ‘contexts’ and ‘conditions’ as the ‘source of\n\nfree and informed choice’.\n\n109) The aforesaid discourse on the concept of human dignity is from\n\nan individual point of view. That is the emphasis of the petitioners\n\nas well. That would be one side of the coin. A very important\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 192 of 567\n\nfeature which the present case has brought into focus is another\n\ndimension of human dignity, namely, in the form of ‘common\n\ngood’ or ‘public good’. Thus, our endeavour here is to give richer\n\nand more nuanced understanding to the concept of human\n\ndignity. Here, dignity is not limited to an individual and is to be\n\nseen in an individualistic way. A reflection on this facet of human\n\ndignity was stated in\nNational Legal Services Authority\n\n(Transgenders’\ncase), which can be discerned from the following\n\ndiscussion:\n\n“103. A corollary of this development is that while so long\nthe negative language of\nArticle 21\nand use of the word\n“deprived” was supposed to impose upon the State the\nnegative duty not to interfere with the life or liberty of an\nindividual without the sanction of law, the width and\namplitude of this provision has now imposed a positive\nobligation (\nVincent Panikurlangara v. Union of India\n) upon\nthe State to take steps for ensuring to the individual a\nbetter enjoyment of his life and dignity e.g.:\n\n(i) Maintenance and improvement of public health (\nVincent\nPanikurlangara v. Union of India\n).\n\n(ii) Elimination of water and air pollution (M.C. Mehta v.\n\nUnion of India).\n\n(iii) Improvement of means of communication (\nState of H.P.\nv. Umed Ram Sharma\n).\n\n(iv) Rehabilitation of bonded labourers (\nBandhua Mukti\nMorcha v. Union of India\n).\n\n(v) Providing human conditions in prisons (\nSher Singh v.\nState of Punjab\n) and protective homes (\nSheela Barse v.\nUnion of India\n).\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 193 of 567\n\n(vi) Providing hygienic condition in a slaughterhouse\n(\nBuffalo Traders Welfare Assn. v. Maneka Gandhi\n).\n\n104. The common golden thread which passes through all\nthese pronouncements is that\nArticle 21\nguarantees\nenjoyment of life by all citizens of this country with dignity,\nviewing this human right in terms of human development.\n\n105. The concepts of justice social, economic and political,\nequality of status and of opportunity and of assuring dignity\nof the individual incorporated in the Preamble, clearly\nrecognise the right of one and all amongst the citizens of\nthese basic essentials designed to flower the citizen's\npersonality to its fullest. The concept of equality helps the\ncitizens in reaching their highest potential. Thus, the\nemphasis is on the development of an individual in all\nrespects.”\n\n110) Christopher McCrudden, an Oxford Academic, in his article\n\n‘Human Dignity and Judicial Interpretation of Human Rights’ 47\n\npublished in the European Journal of International Law on\n\nSeptember 01, 2008 traces the evolution of concept of human\n\ndignity. In substance, his analysis is that in the early stages of\n\nsocial evolution, human dignity was understood as a concept\n\nassociated with ‘status’. Only those individuals were considered\n\nworthy of respect who enjoyed a certain status within the social\n\nconstruct. Though one finds statements about dignity of humans\n\nas human beings on account of the human being the highest\n\ncreation of God and his possession of mind and the power of\n\nreason in the Oration of Marcus Tullius Cicero, a Roman\n\nPolitician and Philosopher (63 BC), and in the works of Pico della\n47 Published in the European Journal of International Law on September 01, 2008\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 194 of 567\n\nMirandola, a Reformation Humanist (1486) ‘On the dignity of\n\nman’, yet there existed human beings who were not considered\n\nas human beings. There were slaves who were treated at par\n\nwith animals.\n\n111) Kant expounded the theory that humans should be treated as an\n\nend in themselves and not merely as a means to an end with\n\nability to choose their destiny. Emphasis was laid on the intrinsic\n\nworth of the human being. Based on this philosophy emerged\n\nthe initial declaration of rights. Kant wrote thus:\n\n“Humanity itself is a dignity; for a human being cannot be\nused merely as a means by any human being (...) but must\nalways be used at the same time as an end. It is just in this\nthat his dignity (personality) consists, by which he raises\nhimself above all other beings in the world that are not\nhuman beings and yet can be used, and so overall things.”\n\n112) Charles Bernard Renouvier, a French Philosopher, said:\n\n“Republic is a State which best reconciles dignity of\nindividual with dignity of everyone.”\n\n113) Dignity extended to all citizens involves the idea of\n\ncommunitarism. A little earlier in 1798, Friedrich Schiller, a\n\nGerman poet of freedom and philosophy, brought out the\n\nconnection between dignity and social condition in his work\n\n“Wurde des Menschen”. He said “(g)ive him food and shelter;\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 195 of 567\n\nwhen you have covered his nakedness, dignity will follow by\n\nitself.” It was during the period that abolition of slavery became\n\nan important political agenda. Slavery was considered as an\n\naffront to human dignity.\n\n114) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) recorded in\n\nthe Preamble recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal\n\nand inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the\n\nfoundation of freedom, justice and peace. It included freedom\n\nfrom fear and want as amongst the highest aspirations of the\n\ncommon people. This is of course subject to resources of each\n\nState. But the realisation is contemplated through national effort\n\nand international cooperation. Evidently, the UDHR adopts a\n\nsubstantive or communitarian concept of human dignity. The\n\nrealisation of intrinsic worth of every human being, as a member\n\nof society through national efforts as an indispensable condition\n\nhas been recognised as an important human right. Truly\n\nspeaking, this is directed towards the deprived, downtrodden and\n\nhave nots.\n\n115) We, therefore, have to keep in mind humanistic concept of\n\nhuman dignity which is to be accorded to a particular segment of\n\nthe society and, in fact, a large segment. Their human dignity is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 196 of 567\n\nbased on the socio-economic rights that are read in to the\n\nfundamental rights, as already discussed above.\n\n116) When we read socio-economic rights into human dignity, the\n\ncommunity approach also assumes importance along with\n\nindividualistic approach to human dignity. It has now been well\n\nrecognised that at its core, human dignity contains three\n\nelements, namely, intrinsic value, autonomy and community\n\nvalue. These are known as core values of human dignity. These\n\nthree elements can assist in structuring legal reasoning and\n\njustifying judicial choices in ‘hard cases’. It has to be borne in\n\nmind that human dignity is a constitutional principle, rather than\n\nfree standing fundamental rights. Insofar as intrinsic value is\n\nconcerned, here human dignity is linked to the nature of being.\n\nWe may give brief description of these three contents of the idea\n\nof human dignity as below:\n\n(I) Intrinsic Value:\n\nThe uniqueness of human kind is the product of a\n\ncombination of inherent traits and features – including\n\nintelligence, sensibility, and the ability to communicate – that give\n\nhumans a special status in the world, distinct from other\n\nspecies.48 The intrinsic value of all individuals results in two\n48 See George Kateb, Human Dignity 5 (2011) (“[W]e can distinguish between the dignity of every\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 197 of 567\n\nbasic postulates: anti-utilitarian and anti-authoritarian. The former\n\nconsists of the formulation of Kant’s categorical imperative that\n\nevery individual is an end in him or herself, not a means for\n\ncollective goals or the purposes of others. The latter is\n\nsynthesized in the idea that the State exists for the individual, not\n\nthe other way around. As for its legal implications, intrinsic value\n\nis the origin of a set of fundamental rights. The first of these\n\nrights is the right to life, a basic precondition for the enjoyment of\n\nany other right. A second right directly related to the intrinsic\n\nvalue of each and every individual is equality before and under\n\nthe law. All individuals are of equal value and, therefore, deserve\n\nequal respect and concern. This means not being discriminated\n\nagainst due to race, colour, ethnic or national origin, sex, age or\n\nmental capacity (the right to non-discrimination), as well as\n\nrespect for cultural, religious, or linguistic diversity (the right to\n\nrecognition). Human dignity fulfills only part of the content of the\n\nidea of equality, and in many situations it may be acceptable to\n\ndifferentiate among people. In the contemporary world, this is\n\nparticularly at issue in cases involving affirmative action and the\n\nrights of religious minorities. Intrinsic value also leads to the right\n\nto integrity, both physical and mental. The right to physical\n\nhuman individual and the dignity of the human species as a whole.”).\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 198 of 567\n\nintegrity includes the prohibition of torture, slave labour, and\n\ndegrading treatment or punishment. Discussions on life\n\nimprisonment, interrogation techniques, and prison conditions\n\ntake place within the scope of this right. The right to mental\n\nintegrity comprises the right to personal honour and image and\n\nincludes the right to privacy.\n\n(II) Autonomy:\n\nAutonomy is the ethical element of human dignity. It is the\n\nfoundation of the free will of individuals, which entitles them to\n\npursue the ideals of living well and having a good life in their own\n\nways. The central notion is that of self-determination: An\n\nautonomous person establishes the rules that will govern his or\n\nher life. Kantian conception of autonomy is the will governed by\n\nthe moral law (moral autonomy). Here, we are concerned with\n\npersonal autonomy, which is value neutral and means the free\n\nexercise of the will according to one’s own values, interests, and\n\ndesires. Autonomy requires the fulfillment of certain conditions,\n\nsuch as reason (the mental capacity to make informed decisions),\n\nindependence (the absence of coercion, manipulation and severe\n\nwant), and choice (the actual existence of alternatives).\n\nAutonomy, thus, is the ability to make personal decisions and\n\nchoices in life based on one’s conception of the good, without\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 199 of 567\n\nundue external influences. As for its legal implications, autonomy\n\nunderlies a set of fundamental rights associated with democratic\n\nconstitutionalism, including basic freedoms (private autonomy)\n\nand the right of political participation (public autonomy).\n\nIt would be pertinent to emphasise here that with the rise of\n\nthe welfare state, many countries in the world (and that includes\n\nIndia) also consider a fundamental right to minimum living\n\nconditions (the existential minimum) in the balancing that results\n\ninto effective autonomy. Thus, there are three facets of\n\nautonomy, namely: private autonomy, public autonomy and the\n\nexistential minimum. Insofar as the last component is concerned,\n\nit is also referred to as social minimum or the basic right to the\n\nprovision of adequate living conditions has its roots in right to\n\nequality as well. In fact, equality, in a substantive sense, and\n\nespecially autonomy (both private and public), are dependent on\n\nthe fact that individuals are “free from want,” meaning that their\n\nessential needs are satisfied. To be free, equal, and capable of\n\nexercising responsible citizenship, individuals must pass\n\nminimum thresholds of well-being, without which autonomy is a\n\nmere fiction. This requires access to some essential utilities,\n\nsuch as basic education and health care services, as well as\n\nsome elementary necessities, such as food, water, clothing, and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 200 of 567\n\nshelter. The existential minimum, therefore, is the core content of\n\nsocial and economic rights. This concept of minimum social right\n\nis protected by the Court, time and again.\n\n(III) Community Value:\n\nThis element of human dignity as community value relates\n\nto the social dimension of dignity. The contours of human dignity\n\nare shaped by the relationship of the individual with others, as\n\nwell as with the world around him. English poet John Donne\n\nexpresses the same sentiments when he says ‘no man is an\n\nisland, entire of itself’ 49. The individual, thus, lives within himself,\n\nwithin a community, and within a state. His personal autonomy is\n\nconstrained by the values, rights, and morals of people who are\n\njust as free and equal as him, as well as by coercive regulation.\n\nRobert Post identified three distinct forms of social order:\n\ncommunity (a “shared world of common faith and fate”),\n\nmanagement (the instrumental organization of social life through\n\nlaw to achieve specific objectives), and democracy (an\n\narrangement that embodies the purpose of individual and\n\ncollective self-determination. These three forms of social order\n\npresuppose and depend on each other, but are also in constant\n\ntension.\n\n49 See John Donne, XVII. Mediation, in Devotions upon Emergent Occasions 107, 108-09 (Uyniv.\nOf Mich. Press 1959) (1624)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 201 of 567\n\nDignity as a community value, therefore, emphasises the\n\nrole of the state and community in establishing collective goals\n\nand restrictions on individual freedoms and rights on behalf of a\n\ncertain idea of the good life. The relevant question here is in\n\nwhat circumstances and to what degree should these actions be\n\nregarded as legitimate in a constitutional democracy? The liberal\n\npredicament that the state must be neutral with regard to different\n\nconceptions of the good in a plural society is not incompatible, of\n\ncourse, with limitation resulting from the necessary coexistence of\n\ndifferent views and potentially conflicting rights. Such\n\ninterferences, however, must be justified on grounds of a\n\nlegitimate idea of justice, an “overlapping consensus” 50 that can\n\nbe shared by most individuals and groups. Whenever such\n\ntension arises, the task of balancing is to be achieved by the\n\nCourts.\n\nWe would like to highlight one more significant feature\n\nwhich the issues involved in the present case bring about. It is\n\nthe balancing of two facets of dignity of the same individual.\n\nWhereas, on the one hand, right of personal autonomy is a part\n\nof dignity (and right to privacy), another part of dignity of the\n\nsame individual is to lead a dignified life as well (which is again a\n50 “Overlapping consensus” is a term coined by John Rawls that identifies basic ideas of justice\nthat can be shared by supporters of different religious, political, and moral comprehensive\ndoctrines.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 202 of 567\n\nfacet of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution). Therefore, in a scenario\n\nwhere the State is coming out with welfare schemes, which strive\n\nat giving dignified life in harmony with human dignity and in the\n\nprocess some aspect of autonomy is sacrificed, the balancing of\n\nthe two becomes an important task which is to be achieved by\n\nthe Courts. For, there cannot be undue intrusion into the\n\nautonomy on the pretext of conferment of economic benefits.\n\nPrecisely, this very exercise of balancing is undertaken by the\n\nCourt in resolving the complex issues raised in the petitions.\n\nDoctrine of Proportionality:\n\n117) As noted above, whenever challenge is laid to an action of the\n\nState on the ground that it violates the right to privacy, the action\n\nof the State is to be tested on the following parameters:\n\n(a) the action must be sanctioned by law;\n\n(b) the proposed action must be necessary in a democratic\n\nsociety for a legitimate aim; and\n\n(c) the extent of such interference must be proportionate to the\n\nneed for such interference.\n\n118) Doctrine of proportionality was explained by the Constitution\n\nBench judgment of this Court in\nModern Dental College and\n\nResearch Centre & Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors.\n51.\nIn\n\n51 (2016) 7 SCC 353\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 203 of 567\n\nthe first instance, therefore, it would be apt to reproduce the said\n\ndiscussion:\n\n“60. ...Thus, while examining as to whether the impugned\nprovisions of the statute and rules amount to reasonable\nrestrictions and are brought out in the interest of the\ngeneral public, the exercise that is required to be\nundertaken is the balancing of fundamental right to carry\non occupation on the one hand and the restrictions\nimposed on the other hand. This is what is known as\n“doctrine of proportionality”. Jurisprudentially,\n“proportionality” can be defined as the set of rules\ndetermining the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nlimitation of a constitutionally protected right by a law to be\nconstitutionally permissible. According to Aharon Barak\n(former Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Israel), there are\nfour sub-components of proportionality which need to be\nsatisfied [Aharon Barak, Proportionality: Constitutional\nRights and Their Limitation (Cambridge University Press\n2012)], a limitation of a constitutional right will be\nconstitutionally permissible if:\n\n(i) it is designated for a proper purpose;\n\n(ii) the measures undertaken to effectuate such a\n\nlimitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of that\npurpose;\n\n(iii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that there\nare no alternative measures that may similarly achieve that\nsame purpose with a lesser degree of limitation; and finally\n\n(iv) there needs to be a proper relation (“proportionality\nstricto sensu” or “balancing”) between the importance of\nachieving the proper purpose and the social importance of\npreventing the limitation on the constitutional right.\n\n61. Modern theory of constitutional rights draws a\nfundamental distinction between the scope of the\nconstitutional rights, and the extent of its protection. Insofar\nas the scope of constitutional rights is concerned, it marks\nthe outer boundaries of the said rights and defines its\ncontents. The extent of its protection prescribes the\nlimitations on the exercises of the rights within its scope. In\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 204 of 567\n\nthat sense, it defines the justification for limitations that can\nbe imposed on such a right.\n\n62. It is now almost accepted that there are no absolute\nconstitutional rights [ Though, debate on this vexed issue\nstill continues and some constitutional experts claim that\nthere are certain rights, albeit very few, which can still be\ntreated as “absolute”. Examples given are:(a) Right to\nhuman dignity which is inviolable,(b) Right not to be\nsubjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment\nor punishment. Even in respect of such rights, there is a\nthinking that in larger public interest, the extent of their\nprotection can be diminished. However, so far such\nattempts of the States have been thwarted by the judiciary.]\nand all such rights are related. As per the analysis of\nAharon Barak [Aharon Barak, Proportionality:\n\nConstitutional Rights and Their Limitation (Cambridge\nUniversity Press 2012).] , two key elements in developing\nthe modern constitutional theory of recognising positive\nconstitutional rights along with its limitations are the notions\nof democracy and the rule of law. Thus, the requirement of\nproportional limitations of constitutional rights by a sub-\nconstitutional law i.e. the statute, is derived from an\ninterpretation of the notion of democracy itself. Insofar as\nthe Indian Constitution is concerned, democracy is treated\nas the basic feature of the Constitution and is specifically\naccorded a constitutional status that is recognised in the\nPreamble of the Constitution itself. It is also unerringly\naccepted that this notion of democracy includes human\nrights which is the cornerstone of Indian democracy. Once\nwe accept the aforesaid theory (and there cannot be any\ndenial thereof), as a fortiori, it has also to be accepted that\ndemocracy is based on a balance between constitutional\nrights and the public interests. In fact, such a provision in\n\nArticle 19\nitself on the one hand guarantees some certain\nfreedoms in clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nand at the same time\nempowers the State to impose reasonable restrictions on\nthose freedoms in public interest. This notion accepts the\nmodern constitutional theory that the constitutional rights\nare related. This relativity means that a constitutional\nlicence to limit those rights is granted where such a\nlimitation will be justified to protect public interest or the\nrights of others. This phenomenon—of both the right and\nits limitation in the Constitution—exemplifies the inherent\ntension between democracy's two fundamental elements.\nOn the one hand is the right's element, which constitutes a\nfundamental component of substantive democracy; on the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 205 of 567\n\nother hand is the people element, limiting those very rights\nthrough their representatives. These two constitute a\nfundamental component of the notion of democracy,\nthough this time in its formal aspect. How can this tension\nbe resolved? The answer is that this tension is not resolved\nby eliminating the “losing” facet from the Constitution.\nRather, the tension is resolved by way of a proper\nbalancing of the competing principles. This is one of the\nexpressions of the multi-faceted nature of democracy.\nIndeed, the inherent tension between democracy's different\nfacets is a “constructive tension”. It enables each facet to\ndevelop while harmoniously coexisting with the others. The\nbest way to achieve this peaceful coexistence is through\nbalancing between the competing interests. Such\nbalancing enables each facet to develop alongside the\nother facets, not in their place. This tension between the\ntwo fundamental aspects—rights on the one hand and its\nlimitation on the other hand—is to be resolved by balancing\nthe two so that they harmoniously coexist with each other.\nThis balancing is to be done keeping in mind the relative\nsocial values of each competitive aspects when considered\nin proper context.\n\n63. In this direction, the next question that arises is as to\nwhat criteria is to be adopted for a proper balance between\nthe two facets viz. the rights and limitations imposed upon\nit by a statute. Here comes the concept of “proportionality”,\nwhich is a proper criterion. To put it pithily, when a law\nlimits a constitutional right, such a limitation is constitutional\nif it is proportional. The law imposing restrictions will be\ntreated as proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper\npurpose, and if the measures taken to achieve such a\npurpose are rationally connected to the purpose, and such\nmeasures are necessary. This essence of doctrine of\nproportionality is beautifully captured by Dickson, C.J. of\nCanada in R. v. Oakes [R. v. Oakes, (1986) 1 SCR 103\n(Can SC)] , in the following words (at p. 138):\n\n‘To establish that a limit is reasonable and\ndemonstrably justified in a free and democratic\nsociety, two central criteria must be satisfied. First,\nthe objective, which the measures, responsible for a\nlimit on a Charter right or freedom are designed to\nserve, must be “of” sufficient importance to warrant\noverriding a constitutional protected right or freedom\n… Second … the party invoking\nSection 1\nmust show\nthat the means chosen are reasonable and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 206 of 567\n\ndemonstrably justified. This involves “a form of\nproportionality test…” Although the nature of the\nproportionality test will vary depending on the\ncircumstances, in each case courts will be required to\nbalance the interests of society with those of\nindividuals and groups. There are, in my view, three\nimportant components of a proportionality test. First,\nthe measures adopted must be … rationally\nconnected to the objective. Second, the means …\nshould impair “as little as possible” the right or\nfreedom in question … Third, there must be a\nproportionality between the effects of the measures\nwhich are responsible for limiting the Charter right or\nfreedom, and the objective which has been identified\nas of “sufficient importance”. The more severe the\ndeleterious effects of a measure, the more important\nthe objective must be if the measure is to be\nreasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and\ndemocratic society.’\n\n64. The exercise which, therefore, is to be taken is to find\nout as to whether the limitation of constitutional rights is for\na purpose that is reasonable and necessary in a\ndemocratic society and such an exercise involves the\nweighing up of competitive values, and ultimately an\nassessment based on proportionality i.e. balancing of\ndifferent interests.\n\n65. We may unhesitatingly remark that this doctrine of\nproportionality, explained hereinabove in brief, is enshrined\nin\nArticle 19\nitself when we read clause (1) along with\nclause (6) thereof. While defining as to what constitutes a\nreasonable restriction, this Court in a plethora of judgments\nhas held that the expression “reasonable restriction” seeks\nto strike a balance between the freedom guaranteed by\nany of the sub-clauses of clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nand the\nsocial control permitted by any of the clauses (2) to (6). It is\nheld that the expression “reasonable” connotes that the\nlimitation imposed on a person in the enjoyment of the right\nshould not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond\nwhat is required in the interests of public. Further, in order\nto be reasonable, the restriction must have a reasonable\nrelation to the object which the legislation seeks to achieve,\nand must not go in excess of that object (see\nP.P.\nEnterprises v. Union of India\n).\n\nAt the same time,\nreasonableness of a restriction has to be determined in an\nobjective manner and from the standpoint of the interests\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 207 of 567\n\nof the general public and not from the point of view of the\npersons upon whom the restrictions are imposed or upon\nabstract considerations (see\nMohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State\nof Bihar\n).\n\nIn\nM.R.F. Ltd. v. State of Kerala\n, this Court held\nthat in examining the reasonableness of a statutory\nprovision one has to keep in mind the following factors:\n\n(1) The directive principles of State policy.\n\n(2) Restrictions must not be arbitrary or of an excessive\nnature so as to go beyond the requirement of the interest of\nthe general public.\n\n(3) In order to judge the reasonableness of the restrictions,\nno abstract or general pattern or a fixed principle can be\nlaid down so as to be of universal application and the same\nwill vary from case to case as also with regard to changing\nconditions, values of human life, social philosophy of the\nConstitution, prevailing conditions and the surrounding\ncircumstances.\n\n(4) A just balance has to be struck between the restrictions\nimposed and the social control envisaged by\nArticle 19(6).\n\n(5) Prevailing social values as also social needs which are\nintended to be satisfied by the restrictions.\n\n(6) There must be a direct and proximate nexus or\nreasonable connection between the restrictions imposed\nand the object sought to be achieved. If there is a direct\nnexus between the restrictions, and the object of the Act,\nthen a strong presumption in favour of the constitutionality\nof the Act will naturally arise.”\n(emphasis in original)\n\n119) We may note at this stage that there is a growing awareness of\n\nthe practical importance of the principle of proportionality for\n\nrights adjudication and it has sparked a wave of academic\n\nscholarship as well. The first integrates the doctrine of\n\nproportionality into a broader theoretical framework. It is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 208 of 567\n\npropounded by Robert Alexy, premised on the theory of rights as\n\nprinciples and optimisation requirements52. For Alexy, all norms\n\nare either rules or principles. Constitutional rights are principles,\n\nwhich means that they must be realised to the greatest extent\n\nfactually and legally possible. For Alexy, the principle of\n\nproportionality follows logically from the nature of constitutional\n\nrights as principles. On the other hand, Mattias Kumm presented\n\nhis theory of rights adjudication as Socratic contestation, with\n\nproportionality principle at its centre. As per Kumm,\n\nproportionality is the doctrinal tool which allows Judges to assess\n\nthe reasonableness or plausibility, of a policy and thus to\n\ndetermine whether it survives Socratic contestation 53. Recently,\n\nKai Moller has proposed another theory, which is an autonomy-\n\nbased theory of what he calls ‘the global model of constitutional\n\nrights’, at the core of which lies the obligation of the State to take\n\nthe autonomy interests of every person adequately into account 54.\n\nIn this process, his understanding of autonomy leads to one\n\nconsequence, viz., there will often be conflicts of autonomy\n\ninterests, which have to be resolved in line with each agent’s\n\n52 Robert Alexy, A Theory of Constitutional Rights, (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002)\n53 M Kumm, ‘The Idea of Socratic Contestation and the Right to Justification: The Point and\nPurpose of Rights-Based Proportionality Review’ (2010) 4 Law & Ethics of Human Rights 141; M\nKumm, ‘Institutionalising Socratic Contestation: The Rationalist Human Rights Paradigm,\nLegitimate Authority and the point of Judicial Review’ (2007) 1 European Journal of Legal\nStudies.\n\n54 K Moller, The Global Model of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012).\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 209 of 567\n\nstatus as an equal. Here, the proportionality principle becomes\n\nthe doctrinal tool which guides Judges through the process of\n\nresolving those conflicts.\n\nOne thing is clear from the above, i.e. jurisprudential\n\nexplanations of proportionality principle. There may be some\n\ndifferences about the approach on the application of\n\nproportionality doctrine, it is certain that proportionality has\n\nbecome the lingua franca of judicial systems across borders,\n\nconcerning the circumstances under which it is appropriate to\n\nlimit fundamental rights.\n\n120) The proportionality test which is stated in the aforesaid judgment,\n\naccepting Justice Barak’s conceptualisation, essentially takes the\n\nversion which is used by the German Federal Constitutional\n\nCourt and is also accepted by most theorists of proportionality.\n\nAccording to this test, a measure restricting a right must, first,\n\nserve a legitimate goal (legitimate goal stage); it must, secondly,\n\nbe a suitable means of furthering this goal (suitability or rational\n\nconnection stage); thirdly, there must not be any less restrictive\n\nbut equally effective alternative (necessity stage); and fourthly,\n\nthe measure must not have a disproportionate impact on the\n\nright-holder (balancing stage).\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 210 of 567\n\n121) Many issues arise while undertaking the exercise of\n\nproportionality inquiry. At legitimate goal stage, question arises\n\nas to what does it mean to speak of the goal of a policy, and what\n\ndoes it mean to require a goal to be legitimate? 55 With regard to\n\nthe suitability and necessity stages, some of the open issues are\n\nhow to deal with empirical uncertainty: should this lead to wide-\n\nranging deference to the elected branches? 56 At the balancing\n\nstage, we have to ask the question of what it means to say that a\n\nright is ‘balanced’ against a competing right or public interest.\n\nOne remarkable feature of the German test is that it tends to\n\npush most of the important issues into the last stage, viz., the\n\nbalancing stage. At the legitimate goal stage, any goal that is\n\nlegitimate will be accepted. At the suitability stage, even a\n\nmarginal contribution to the achievement of the goal will suffice.\n\nAt the necessity stage, it is very rare for a policy to fail because\n\nless restrictive alternatives normally come with some\n\ndisadvantage and cannot, therefore, be considered equally\n\neffective. Thus, the balancing stage dominates the legal analysis\n\nand is usually determinative of the outcome.\n\n55 On this issue there is a detailed discussion in M Kumm, ‘Political Liberalism and the Structure of\nRights: On the Place and Limits of the Proportionality Requirement’ in Pavlakos (ed), Law,\nRights and Discourse: The Legal Philosophy of Robert Alexy (Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2007)\n131; Moller, the Global Model of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012) ch\n\n7.\n56 As a proposal of how to deal with uncertainty, see Alexy’s ‘Second Law of Balancing’, which he\nproposes in the Postscript to A Theory of Constitutional Rights (Oxford, Oxford University Press,\n2002).\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 211 of 567\n\n122) In contrast, Canadian Supreme Court has chartered different\n\ncourse while using proportionality test. R. v. Oakes57 (popularly\n\nknown as Oakes test), has held that the objective must be ‘of\n\nsufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally\n\nprotected right or freedom’; there must be a rational connection\n\nbetween measure and objective; the means must ‘impair “as little\n\nas possible” the right or freedom in question’; and finally, ‘there\n\nmust be a proportionality between the effects of the measures\n\nwhich are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom,\n\nand the objective which has been identified as of “sufficient\n\nimportance”’. Under this test, arguably more issues are\n\naddressed at the earlier stages. Instead of accepting any\n\nlegitimate goal, Oakes requires a goal ‘of sufficient importance to\n\nwarrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom’.\n\nAnd the minimal impairment test is different from the German\n\nnecessity test both in the way in which it is formulated (there is no\n\nrequirement that the less restrictive measure be equally effective)\n\nand in the way it is applied in practice: the Canadian Supreme\n\nCourt tends to resolve cases at that stage and not, as the\n\nGerman Federal Constitutional Court, at the balancing stage.\n\n123) There is a great debate as to which out of the aforesaid two\n57 (1986) 1 SCR 103\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 212 of 567\n\napproaches is a better approach. Some jurists are of the view\n\nthat the proper application of the German test leads to a practice\n\nof constitutional review with two connected problems: first, as\n\npointed about above, usually almost all the moral work is done at\n\nthe balancing stage, arguably rendering the earlier stages largely\n\nuseless and throwing doubt on the truth of the popular argument\n\nthat proportionality is a valuable doctrine partly because it\n\nstructures the analysis of rights issues in a meaningful way.\n\nSecondly, the balancing act at the final stage is often carried out\n\nin an impressionistic fashion which seems to be largely unguided\n\nby principle and thus opens the door for subjective, arbitrary and\n\nunpredictable judgments encroaching on what ought to be the\n\nproper domain of the democratic legislature. These concerns\n\ncan, however, be addressed. According to Bilchitz 58, first concern\n\ncan be addressed by focusing on the necessity stage of the test.\n\nHe takes issue with both the German test – according to which\n\nalmost all policies are necessary because any alternative policy\n\nwill usually have some disadvantage which means that it cannot\n\nbe considered equally effective – and the Canadian minimal\n\nimpairment test – which, taken seriously, narrows down the range\n\nof constitutionally acceptable policies far too much: ‘minimal\n\n58 ‘Necessity and Proportionality: Towards A Balanced Approach?’, Hart Publishing, Oxford and\nPortland, Oregon, 2016.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 213 of 567\n\nimpairment’ can be read as insisting that only one measure could\n\npass constitutional scrutiny, namely the measure which impairs\n\nthe right least.59 So the alternatives seem to be either to\n\nconstruct the necessity (minimal impairment) test as filtering out\n\nalmost nothing or to allow only one policy, thus rendering the\n\nelected branches partly superfluous. In order to preserve a\n\nmeaningful but not unduly strict role for the necessity stage,\n\nBilchitz proposes the following inquiry. First, a range of possible\n\nalternatives to the measure employed by the Government must\n\nbe identified. Secondly, the effectiveness of these measures\n\nmust be determined individually; the test here is not whether each\n\nrespective measure realises the governmental objective to the\n\nsame extent, but rather whether it realises it in a ‘real and\n\nsubstantial manner’. Thirdly, the impact of the respective\n\nmeasures on the right at stake must be determined. Finally, an\n\noverall judgment must be made as to whether in light of the\n\nfindings of the previous steps, there exists an alternative which is\n\npreferable; and this judgment will go beyond the strict means-\n\nends assessment favoured by Grimm and the German version of\n\nthe proportionality test; it will also require a form of balancing to\n\n59 On the various problems which the Canadian Supreme Court created for itself because of its\nearly unfortunate statements on proportionality see S Choudhry, ‘So What Is the Real Legacy of\nOakes? Two Decades of Proportionality Analysis under the Canadian Charter’s\nSection 1\n’ (2006)\n34 Supreme Court Law Review 501.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 214 of 567\n\nbe carried out at the necessity stage.\n\n124) Insofar as second problem in German test is concerned, it can be\n\ntaken care of by avoiding ‘ad-hoc balancing’ and instead\n\nproceeding on some ‘bright-line rules’ i.e. by doing the act of\n\nbalancing on the basis of some established rule or by creating a\n\nsound rule. We may point out that whereas Chandrachud, J. has\n\nformulated the test of ‘legitimate state interest’, other two of the\n\nJudges, namely, Chelameswar and Sapre, JJ. have used the test\n\nof ‘compelling state interest’ and not ‘legitimate state interest’.\n\nOn the other hand, S.K. Kaul, J. has held that the test to be\n\napplied is whether the law satisfies ‘public interest’. Nariman, J.,\n\non the other hand, pointed out that the\nRight to Information Act,\nhas provided for personal information being disclosed to\n\nthird parties subject to ‘larger public interest’ being satisfied. If\n\nthis test is applied, the result is that one would be entitled to\n\ninvoke ‘large public interest’ in lieu of ‘legitimate state aim’ or\n\n‘legitimate state interest’, as a permissible restriction on a claim to\n\nprivacy of an individual – a more lenient test. However, since\n\njudgment of Chandrachud, J. is on behalf of himself and three\n\nother Judges and S.K. Kaul, J. has also virtually adopted the\n\nsame test, we can safely adopt the test of ‘legitimate state\n\ninterest’ as the majority opinion, instead of applying the test of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 215 of 567\n\n‘compelling state interest’.\n\n125) In Modern Dental College & Research Centre, four sub\n\ncomponents or proportionality which need to be satisfied were\n\ntaken note of. These are:\n\n(a) A measure restricting a right must have a legitimate goal\n\n(legitimate goal stage).\n\n(b) It must be a suitable means of furthering this goal (suitability\n\nor rationale connection stage).\n\n(c) There must not be any less restrictive but equally effective\n\nalternative (necessity stage).\n\n(d) The measure must not have a disproportionate impact on\n\nthe right holder (balancing stage).\n\n126) This has been approved in K.S. Puttaswamy as well. Therefore,\n\nthe aforesaid stages of proportionality can be looked into and\n\ndiscussed. Of course, while undertaking this exercise it has also\n\nto be seen that the legitimate goal must be of sufficient\n\nimportance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right\n\nor freedom and also that such a right impairs freedom as little as\n\npossible. This Court, in its earlier judgments, applied German\n\napproach while applying proportionality test to the case at hand.\n\nWe would like to proceed on that very basis which, however, is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 216 of 567\n\ntempered with more nuanced approach as suggested by Bilchitz.\n\nThis, in fact, is the amalgam of German and Canadian approach.\n\nWe feel that the stages, as mentioned in Modern Dental College\n\n& Research Centre and recapitulated above, would be the safe\n\nmethod in undertaking this exercise, with focus on the\n\nparameters as suggested by Bilchitz, as this projects an ideal\n\napproach that need to be adopted.\n\nIssues:\n\n127) After setting the tone of the case, it is now time to specify the\n\nprecise issues which are involved that need to be decided in\n\nthese matters:\n\n(1) Whether the Aadhaar Project creates or has tendency to\ncreate surveillance state and is, thus, unconstitutional on\nthis ground?\n\n(a) What is the magnitude of protection that needs to be\naccorded to collection, storage and usage of\nbiometric data?\n\n(b) Whether the Aadhaar Act and Rules provide such\nprotection, including in respect of data minimisation,\npurpose limitation, time period for data retention and\ndata protection and security?\n\n(2) Whether the Aadhaar Act violates right to privacy and is\nunconstitutional on this ground?\n\n{This issue is considered in the context of Sections 7 and 8\nof the Aadhaar Act.

This means that\n\nit enables the State to profile citizens, track their movements,\n\nassess their habits and silently influence their behaviour\n\nthroughout their lives. Over time, the profiling enables the State to\n\nstifle dissent and influence political decision making. The\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 219 of 567\n\narchitecture of the project comprises a Central Identities Data\n\nRepository which stores and maintains authentication transaction\n\ndata. The authentication record comprises the time of\n\nauthentication and the identity of the requesting entity. The UIDAI\n\nand the Authentication Service Agency (ASA) is permitted to store\n\nthis authentication record for 2 + 5 years (as per Regulations 20\n\nand 26/27 of the Authentication Regulations). Based on this\n\narchitecture it is possible for the State to track down the location\n\nof the person seeking authentication. Since the requesting entity\n\nis also identified, the activity that the citizen is engaging in is also\n\nknown. (\nSections 2(d)\n,\n2(h)\n,\n,\n,\nof the Act read with\n\nRegulations 18, 20, 26 of the Aadhaar (Authentication)\n\nRegulation, 2016).\n\n131) According to the petitioners, the Authority has the following\n\ninformation (according to the document on technical specification\n\nof Aadhaar registered devices published by the Authority in\n\nFebruary 2017) – Aadhaar number, name of Aadhaar holder,\n\nwhether authentication failed or was successful, reason for such\n\nfailure, requesting entities’ Internet Protocol (IP) address, date\n\nand time of authentication, device ID and its unique ID of\n\nauthentication device which can be used to locate the individual.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 220 of 567\n\n132) Authentication of Aadhaar number enables tracking, tagging and\n\nprofiling of individuals as the IP Address of the authentication\n\ndevice gives an idea of its geographical location (determinable\n\nwithin the range of 2 kilometres), country, city, region, pin\n\ncode/zip code). Mr. Divan submits that an individual is on an\n\nelectronic leash, tethered to a central data repository that has the\n\narchitecture to track all activities of an individual. The Aadhaar\n\nAct creates a database of all Indian residents and citizens with\n\ntheir core biometric information, demographic information and\n\nmeta data. In light of the enormous potential of information,\n\nconcentration of information in a single entity, i.e., the Authority,\n\nenabling easier access to aggregated information puts the State\n\nin a position to wield enormous power. Given that with\n\nadvancements in technology, such information can affect every\n\naspect of an individual’s personal, professional, religious and\n\nsocial life, such power is a threat to individual freedoms\n\nguaranteed under\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nto 19(1)(g) of the Constitution\n\nand other fundamental rights guaranteed under\nArticle 21 (Right\n\nto informational privacy)\nand\nArticle 25\nof the Constitution. It was\n\nsubmitted that the Aadhaar Act treats the entire populace of the\n\ncountry as potential criminals ignoring the necessity to balance\n\nthe State’s mandate of protection against crime with the right to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 221 of 567\n\npersonal bodily integrity which is envisaged under\nArticle 21\nread\n\nwith\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution. It does not require the\n\ncollection of data to have a nexus with a crime. Mr. Sibal submits\n\nthat in the decision in\nSelvi & Ors. v. State of Karnataka60\n, this\n\nCourt has held:\n\n“The theory of interrelationship of rights mandates that the\nright against self-incrimination should also be read as a\ncomponent of “personal liberty” under\nArticle 21.\nHence,\nour understanding of the “right to privacy” should account\nfor its intersection with\nArticle 20(3)\n”\n\n133) It is argued that the Aadhaar Act, therefore, violates the right to\n\nprotection from self-incrimination, and the right to privacy and\n\npersonal dignity/bodily integrity under\nArticle 20(3)\nand\nArticle 21.\n\n134) It was argued that the Constitution of India repudiates mass\n\nsurveillance as enabled by Aadhaar and the project ought to be\n\nstruck down on this ground alone. There is no question of\n\nbalancing or justification in case of a surveillance architecture.\n\n135) Passages from various judgments were quoted in an attempt to\n\nestablish that surveillance causes interference with right to\n\nprivacy, life and liberty.\nFrom Kharak Singh v. State of U.P.\n61,\n\ndissenting opinion of Subba Rao, J. (which has been upheld in\n\nK.S. Puttaswamy) was relied upon. With respect to how\n\n60 (2010) 7 SCC 263\n61 (1964) 1 SCR 332\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 222 of 567\n\nsurveillance constricts right to life and liberty, His Lordship held\n\nthat:\n\n“Now let us consider the scope of\nArticle 21.\nThe\nexpression \"life\" used in that Article cannot be confined\nonly to the taking away of life, i.e., causing death. In Munn\nv. Illinois (1), Field, J., defined \"life\" in the following words:\n\n“Something more than mere animal existence. The\ninhibition against its deprivation extends to all those\nlimbs and faculties by which life is enjoyed. The\nprovision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body\nby the amputation of an arm or leg, or the putting out\nof an eye, or the destruction of any other organ of the\nbody through which the soul communicates with the\nouter world. The expression \"'liberty\" is given a very\nwide meaning in America. It takes in all the freedoms.\nIn Bolling v. Sharpe (2), the Supreme Court of\nAmerica observed that the said expression was not\nconfined to mere freedom from bodily restraint and\nthat liberty under law extended to the full range of\nconduct which the individual was free to pursue. But\nthis absolute right to liberty was regulated to protect\nother social interests by the State exercising its\npowers such as police power, the power of eminent\ndomain, the power of taxation etc. The proper\nexercise of the power which is called the due process\nof law is controlled by the Supreme Court of America.\nIn India the word \"liberty\" has been qualified by the\nword \"Personal\", indicating thereby that it is confined\nonly to the liberty of the person. The other aspects of\nthe liberty have been provided for in other Articles of\nthe Constitution\n\nxx xx xx\n\nIt is true our Constitution does not expressly declare a\nright to privacy as a fundamental right, but the said\nright is an essential ingredient of personal liberty.\nEvery democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is\nexpected to give him rest, physical happiness, peace\nof mind and security. In the last resort, a person's\nhouse, where he lives with his family, is his “castle”; it\nis his rampart against encroachment on his personal\nliberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 223 of 567\n\nFrankfurter J., in Wolf v. Colorado [[1949] 238 US 25]\npointing out the importance of the security of one's\nprivacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police, could\nhave no less application to an Indian home as to an\nAmerican one. If physical restraints on a person's\nmovements affect his personal liberty, physical\nencroachments on his private life would affect it in a\nlarger degree. Indeed, nothing is more deleterious to\na man's physical happiness and health than a\ncalculated interference with his privacy. We would,\ntherefore, define the right of personal liberty in\nArticle\nas a right of an individual to be free from\nrestrictions or encroachments on his person, whether\nthose restrictions or encroachments are directly\nimposed or indirectly brought about by calculated\nmeasures.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nThe freedom of movement in clause (d) of\nArticle 19\n\ntherefore must be a movement in a free country i.e. in\na country where he can do whatever he likes, speak\nto whomsoever he wants, meet people of his own\nchoice without any apprehension, subject of course to\nthe law of social control. The petitioner under the\nshadow of surveillance is certainly deprived of this\nfreedom. He can move physically, but he cannot do\nso freely, for all his activities are watched and noted.\n\nThe shroud of surveillance cast upon him perforce\nengender inhibitions in him and he cannot act freely\nas he would like to do. ”\n\n136) In the case of\nDistrict Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad and\n\nAnr. v. Canara Bank and Ors.62\n, this Court struck down provisions\n\nof a legislation on grounds that it was too intrusive of citizens’\n\nright to privacy. The case involved an evaluation of the Andhra\n\nPradesh Stamp Act which authorized the collector to delegate\n\n“any person” to enter any premises in order to search for and\n\n62 (2005) 1 SCC 496\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 224 of 567\n\nimpound any document that was found to be improperly stamped.\n\nAfter an exhaustive analysis of privacy laws across the world, and\n\nin India, the Court held that in the absence of any safeguards as\n\nto probable or reasonable cause or reasonable basis, this\n\nprovision was violative of the constitutionally guaranteed right to\n\nprivacy “both of the house and of the person”. The Court held:\n\n“The A.P. amendment permits inspection being carried out\nby the Collector by having access to the documents which\nare in private custody i.e. custody other than that of a\npublic officer. It is clear that this provision empowers\ninvasion of the home of the person in whose possession\nthe documents 'tending' to or leading to the various facts\nstated in\nsec. 73\nare in existence and\nsec. 73\nbeing one\nwithout any safeguards as to probable or reasonable cause\nor reasonable basis or materials violates the right to\nprivacy both of the house and of the person. We have\nalready referred to R. Rajagopal's case wherein the\nlearned judges have held that the right to personal liberty\nalso means the life free from encroachments unsustainable\nin law and such right flowing from\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution.”\n\n137) Reference was made to the U.S Supreme Court case of U.S. v.\n\nJones63 where the court held that installing a Global Positioning\n\nSystem (GPS) tracking device on a vehicle and using the device\n\nto monitor the vehicle's movements constitutes an unlawful\n\nsearch under the Fourth Amendment. Sotomayor, J. in her\n\nconcurring judgment observed that Fourth Amendment search\n\nand seizure is not only concerned with physical trespassory\n\nintrusions on property but also non-physical violation of privacy\n63 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 225 of 567\n\nthat society recognizes as reasonable. She notes that GPS data\n\ncan reveal an entire profile of a person simply by knowing the\n\nplaces she visits and that the Government can mine this data in\n\nthe future:\n\n“With increasing regularity, the Government will be capable\nof duplicating the monitoring undertaken in this case by\nenlisting factory or owner-installed vehicle tracking devises\nor GPS enabled smart-phones … In cases of electronic or\nother novel modes of surveillance that do not depend upon\na physical invasion on property, the trespassory test may\nprovide little guidance.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nGPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive\nrecord of a person’s public movements that reflects a\nwealth of detail about her familial, political, professional,\nreligious, and sexual associations … disclosed GPS data\nwill be trips to the psychiatrist, plastic surgeon, abortion\nclinic, AIDS treatment centre, strip club, criminal defence\nattorney …\n\nGovernment can store such records and efficiently mine\nthem for information years into the future… awareness that\nthe government may be watching chills associational and\nexpressive freedom … it may alter the relationship between\ncitizen and government in a way that is inimical to\ndemocratic society.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nI would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed\nto some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for\nthat reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment\nprotection … (“Privacy is not a discrete commodity,\npossessed absolutely or not at all. Those who disclose\ncertain facts to a bank or phone company for a limited\nbusiness purpose need not assume that this information\nwill be released to other persons for other purposes”) ...\n(“[W]hat [a person] seeks to preserve as private, even in an\narea accessible to the public, may be constitutionally\nprotected”).”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 226 of 567\n\n138) The judgment of the ECtHR in Zakharov v. Russia64 was also\n\nreferred to where the ECtHR examined an application claiming\n\nviolation of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention (right to respect for private\n\nand family life) alleging that the mobile operators had permitted\n\nunrestricted interception of all telephone communications by the\n\nsecurity services without prior judicial authorisation, under the\n\nprevailing national law. The Court observed that:\n\n“Mr Zakharov was entitled to claim to be a victim of a\nviolation of the European Convention, even though he was\nunable to allege that he had been the subject of a concrete\nmeasure of surveillance. Given the secret nature of the\nsurveillance measures provided for by the legislation, their\nbroad scope (affecting all users of mobile telephone\ncommunications) and the lack of effective means to\nchallenge them at national level… Russian law did not\nmeet the “quality of law” requirement and was incapable of\nkeeping the interception of communications to what was\n“necessary in a democratic society”. There had accordingly\nbeen a violation of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention… existence\nof arbitrary and abusive surveillance practices, which\nappear to be due to inadequate safeguards provided by\nlaw”.\n\n139) The Court held that any interference with the right to privacy\n\nunder\nArticle 8\ncan only be justified under\nArticle 8(2)\nif it is in\n\naccordance with law, pursues one or more legitimate aims and is\n\nnecessary in a democratic society to achieve such aim. “In\n\naccordance with the law” requires the impugned measure both to\n\nhave some basis in domestic law and to be compatible with the\n\n64 (2015) Application No. 47143/2006\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 227 of 567\n\nrule of law, which is expressly mentioned in the Preamble to the\n\nConvention and inherent in the object and purpose of\nArticle 8.\n\nThe law must, thus, meet quality requirements: it must be\n\naccessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to its\n\neffects. With respect to foreseeability of surveillance, the court\n\nheld:\n\n“Foreseeability in the special context of secret measures of\nsurveillance, such as the interception of communications,\ncannot mean that an individual should be able to foresee\nwhen the authorities are likely to intercept his\ncommunications so that he can adapt his conduct\naccordingly. However, especially where a power vested in\nthe executive is exercised in secret, the risks of\narbitrariness are evident. It is therefore essential to have\nclear, detailed rules on interception of telephone\nconversations, especially as the technology available for\nuse is continually becoming more sophisticated. The\ndomestic law must be sufficiently clear to give citizens an\nadequate indication as to the circumstances in which and\nthe conditions on which public authorities are empowered\nto resort to any such measures.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nSince the implementation in practice of measures of secret\nsurveillance of communications is not open to scrutiny by\nthe individuals concerned or the public at large, it would be\ncontrary to the rule of law for the discretion granted to the\nexecutive or to a judge to be expressed in terms of an\nunfettered power. Consequently, the law must indicate the\nscope of any such discretion conferred on the competent\nauthorities and the manner of its exercise with sufficient\nclarity to give the individual adequate protection against\narbitrary interference.”\n\n140) The Court observed that the following minimum safeguards that\n\nshould be set out in law in order to avoid abuses of power for\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 228 of 567\n\nsurveillance are: the nature of offences which may give rise to an\n\ninterception order; a definition of the categories of people liable to\n\nhave their telephones tapped; a limit on the duration of telephone\n\ntapping; the procedure to be followed for examining, using and\n\nstoring the data obtained; the precautions to be taken when\n\ncommunicating the data to other parties; and the circumstances\n\nin which recordings may or must be erased or destroyed.\n\n141) For establishing if the measures were “necessary in a democratic\n\nsociety” in pursuit of a legitimate aim, the Court observed:\n\n“When balancing the interest of the respondent State in\nprotecting its national security through secret surveillance\nmeasures against the seriousness of the interference with\nan applicant’s right to respect for his or her private life, the\nnational authorities enjoy a certain margin of appreciation\nin choosing the means for achieving the legitimate aim of\nprotecting national security. However, this margin is subject\nto European supervision embracing both legislation and\ndecisions applying it. In view of the risk that a system of\nsecret surveillance set up to protect national security may\nundermine or even destroy democracy under the cloak of\ndefending it, the Court must be satisfied that there are\nadequate and effective guarantees against abuse. The\nassessment depends on all the circumstances of the case,\nsuch as the nature, scope and duration of the possible\nmeasures, the grounds required for ordering them, the\nauthorities competent to authorise, carry out and supervise\nthem, and the kind of remedy provided by the national law.\nThe Court has to determine whether the procedures for\nsupervising the ordering and implementation of the\nrestrictive measures are such as to keep the “interference”\nto what is “necessary in a democratic society”.”\n\n142) Two other cases of violation of Article of the European\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 229 of 567\n\nConvention of Human Rights were cited, namely Digital Rights\n\nIreland Ltd. v. Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural\n\nResources65 and S and Marper v. United Kingdom66. In Digital\n\nIreland, the European Parliament and the Council of the\n\nEuropean Union adopted Directive 2006/24/EC (Directive), which\n\nregulated Internet Service Providers’ storage of\n\ntelecommunications data. It could be used to retain data\n\ngenerated or processed in connection with the provision of\n\npublicly available electronic communications services or of public\n\ncommunications network for the purpose of fighting serious crime\n\nin the European Union (EU). The data included data necessary to\n\ntrace and identify the source of communication and its\n\ndestination, to identify the date, time duration, type of\n\ncommunication, IP address, telephone number and other fields.\n\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) evaluated the compatibility\n\nof the Directive with\nArticles 7\nand\nof the Charter of\n\nFundamental Rights of the European Union and declared the\n\nDirective to be invalid. According to the ECJ, the Directive\n\ninterfered with the right to respect for private life under\nArticle 7\n\nand with the right to the protection of personal data under Article\n\n8. It allowed very precise conclusion to be drawn concerning the\n\n65 [2014] All ER (D) 66 (Apr)\n66 (2008) ECHR 1581\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 230 of 567\n\nprivate lives of the persons whose data had been retained, such\n\nas habits of everyday life, permanent or temporary places of\n\nresidence, daily and other movements, activities carried out,\n\nsocial relationships and so on. The invasion of right was not\n\nproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n\n143) In S and Marper, the storing of DNA profiles and cellular samples\n\nof any person arrested in the United Kingdom was challenged\n\nbefore the ECtHR. Even if the individual was never charged, if\n\ncriminal proceedings were discontinued, or if the person was later\n\nacquitted of any crime, their DNA profile could nevertheless be\n\nkept permanently on record. It held that there had been a\n\nviolation of\nArticle 8\nof the ECHR. Fingerprints, DNA profiles and\n\ncellular samples, constituted personal data and their retention\n\nwas capable of affecting private life of an individual. Retention of\n\nsuch data without consent, thus, constitutes violation of\nArticle 8\n\nas they relate to identified and identifiable individuals. The Court\n\nheld that invasion of privacy was not “necessary in a democratic\n\nsociety as it did not fulfill any pressing social need. The blanket\n\nand indiscriminate nature of retention of data was excessive and\n\ndid not strike a balance between private and public interest.\n\n144) The respondents, on the other hand, rebutted the arguments of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 231 of 567\n\nthe petitioners that the architecture of the Aadhaar Act enables\n\nState surveillance. It was submitted that bare minimal information\n\nwas obtained from the individual who enrolled for Aadhaar.\n\nInsofar as demographic information is concerned, it included\n\nname, date of birth, address, gender, mobile number and email\n\naddress. The latter two are optional and meant for transmitting\n\nrelevant information to the AMH and for One Time Password\n\n(OTP) based authentication. This information was in respect of\n\nan individual and is always in public domain. Section 2(k) of the\n\nAadhaar Act specifically provides that regulations cannot include\n\nrace, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of\n\nentitlement, income or medical history. Therefore, sensitive\n\ninformation specifically stands excluded. This specific exclusion,\n\nin the context, ensures that the scope of including additional\n\ndemographic information is very narrow and limited. It was also\n\nargued that even the biometric information was limited to the\n\nfingerprints and iris scan, which is considered to be the core\n\nbiometric information. Such information is, again, frequently\n\nutilised globally to ascertain the identity of a person. The\n\nargument was, thus, that the information gathered was non-\n\ninvasive and non-intrusive identity information.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 232 of 567\n\n145) It was also argued that the very scheme of the Aadhaar and the\n\nmanner in which it operates excludes every possibility of data\n\nprofiling and, therefore, the question of State surveillance would\n\nnot arise. The powerpoint presentation which was given by Dr.\n\nPandey, as has been stated above, was referred to, on the basis\n\nof which it was argued that the Aadhaar design takes full care of\n\nsecurity of persons.\n\n146) It was also argued by the respondents that identity information\n\ndata resides in the CIDR which is not in the control of the\n\nGovernment or the police force. The Authority is a body\n\nconstituted as a body corporate having perpetual succession and\n\na common seal. It is regulated by substantive and procedural\n\nchecks to protect the identity information and authentication\n\nrecord. This information cannot be published, displayed or posted\n\npublicly. It does not have the authority to carry out surveillance.\n\nThe State Governments and the police forces cannot obtain the\n\ninformation contained in the CIDR or the authentication records\n\nexcept in two situations contemplated by\nSection 33\n– (i) When\n\nthe District Judge orders so after giving an opportunity of hearing\n\nto the authority (even in this situation core biometric information\n\nwill not be shared; and (ii) in the interest of National Security\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 233 of 567\n\nwhere a Joint Secretary or a superior officer of the Government of\n\nIndia specially authorizes in this behalf, and in this case every\n\ndirection is reviewed by an oversight committee chaired by the\n\nCabinet Secretary. Further, this direction is limited for three\n\nmonths and extendable by a further period of 3 months.\n\n147) It was submitted that surveillance, if at all, can only be carried out\n\nby unauthorised use of CIDR information, despite its statutory\n\nprohibition and punitive injunctions or by other means such as\n\nphysical surveillance. That is, however, an illegal surveillance.\n\nThe architecture of the Act does not allow surveillance. It was\n\nsubmitted that the petitioners have not made out a case of\n\nsurveillance by the Authority but points out a mere possibility of\n\nsurveillance.\n\n148) We may reiterate that the argument of surveillance also has the\n\nreflections of privacy and in fact the argument is structured on the\n\nbasis that the vital information which would be available with the\n\nGovernment can be utilised to create the profiling of individuals\n\nand retention of such information in the hands of the respondents\n\nis a risky affair which may enable the State to do the surveillance\n\nof any individual it wants.\n\n149) Insofar as the aspect of privacy of individual is concerned, that\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 234 of 567\n\nwould be dealt with in detail while addressing that issue. To\n\nsegregate issue of surveillance from privacy, we are focusing the\n\ndiscussion to the aspect whether there is sufficient data available\n\nwith the respondents which may facilitate the profiling and misuse\n\nthereof or whether there are sufficient safeguards to ward off the\n\nsame. In the process, we would be discussing the issues\n\npertaining to data protection as well. At the same time, there\n\nwould be some overlapping of discussion inasmuch as it will have\n\nto be seen as to the collection, storage and use of biometric data\n\nsatisfies the proportionality principle.\n\n150) It is clear that the argument of the petitioners is that on the basis\n\nof the data available with the Authority, there can be a profiling of\n\nan individual which may make the surveillance state. And such a\n\nmass surveillance is not permitted by the Constitution of India.\n\nThe entire foofaraw about the Aadhaar architecture is the so-\n\ncalled enormous information that would be available to the\n\nGovernment on using Aadhaar card by residents. Two issues\n\narise from the respective arguments of the parties:\n\n(a) whether the architecture of the Aadhaar project enables the\n\nSate to create a regime of surveillance?; and\n\n(b) whether there are adequate provisions for data protection?\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 235 of 567\n\n151) Insofar as issue (a) above is concerned, after going through the\n\nvarious aspects of the Aadhaar project, the provisions of the\n\nAadhaar Act and the manner in which it operates, it is difficult to\n\naccept the argument of the petitioners. The respondents have\n\nexplained that the enrolment and authentication processes are\n\nstrongly regulated so that data is secure. The enrolment agency,\n\nwhich collects the biometric and demographic of the individuals\n\nduring enrolment, is appointed either by UIDAI or by a Registrar\n\n[\nSection 2(s)\n]. The Registrars are appointed through MoUs or\n\nagreements for enrolment and are to abide by a code of conduct\n\nand processes, policies and guidelines issued by the Authority.\n\nThey are responsible for the process of enrolment. Categories of\n\npersons eligible for appointment are limited by the Regulations.\n\nThe agency employs a certified supervisor, an operator and a\n\nverifier under Enrolment and Update Regulations. Registrars and\n\nthe enrolling agencies are obliged to use the software provided or\n\nauthorized by UIDAI for enrolment purpose. The standard\n\nsoftware has security features as specified by the Authority. All\n\nequipment used is as per the specification issued by the\n\nAuthority. The Registrars are prohibited from using the\n\ninformation collected for any purpose other than uploading the\n\ninformation to CIDR. Sub-contracting of enrolment function is not\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 236 of 567\n\nallowed. The Code of Conduct contains specific directions for\n\nfollowing the confidentiality, privacy and security protocols and\n\nsubmission of periodic reports of enrolment. Not only there are\n\ndirections prohibiting manipulation and fraudulent practices but\n\nthe Act contains penal provisions for such violations in Chapter\n\nVII of the Regulations. The enrolment agencies are empanelled\n\nby the Authority. They are given an enrolling agency code using\n\nwhich the Registrar can onboard such agency to the CIDR. The\n\nenrolment data is uploaded to the Central Identities Data\n\nRepository (CIDR) certified equipment and software with a digital\n\nsignature of the Registrar/enrolling agency. The data is encrypted\n\nimmediately upon capture. The decryption key is with the UIDAI\n\nsolely.\nSection 2(ze)\nof the Information Technology Act, 2000\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘\nIT Act\n’) which defines ‘secure\n\nsystems’ and\nSection 2(w)\nof the Act, which defines\n\n‘intermediaries’ apply to the process. Authentication only\n\nbecomes available through the Authentication Service Agency\n\n(ASA). They are regulated by the Aadhaar (Authentication)\n\nRegulations, 2016. Their role and responsibilities are provided by\n\nRegulation 19\nof the Authentication Regulations. They are to use\n\ncertified devices. The equipment or software has to be duly\n\nregistered with or approved or certified by the Authority/agency.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 237 of 567\n\nThe systems and operations are audited by information system\n\nauditor. The requesting entities pass the encrypted data to the\n\nCIDR through the ASA and the response (Yes/No authentication\n\nor e-KYC information) also takes the same route back. The\n\nserver of the ASA has to perform basic compliance and\n\ncompleteness checks on the authentication data packet before\n\nforwarding it to the CIDR.\nThe Act\nprohibits sharing and\n\ndisclosure of core biometric data under\nSection 8\nand\n. Other\n\nidentity information is shared with requesting entity (AUAs and\n\nKUAs) only for the limited purpose of authentication. The data is\n\ntransferred from the requesting entity to the ASA to the CIDR in\n\nan encrypted manner through a leased line circuitry using secure\n\nProtocols (\nRegulation 9\nof the Authentication Regulations). The\n\nstorage of data templates is in safely located servers with no\n\npublic internet inlet/outlet, and offline storage of original\n\nencrypted data (PID blocks). There are safety and security\n\nprovisions such as audit by Information Systems Auditor.\n\nRequesting entities are appointed through agreement. They can\n\nenter into agreement with sub-AUA or sub-KUA with permission\n\nof the UIDAI. Whatever identity information is obtained by the\n\nrequesting entity is based on a specific consent of the Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder. The e-KYC data shared with the requesting entity\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 238 of 567\n\ncan only be after prior consent of the Aadhaar holder. Such data\n\ncannot be shared and has to be stored in encrypted form. The\n\nbiometric information used is not permitted to be stored. Only the\n\nlogs of authentication transactions are maintained for a short\n\nperiod. Full identity information is never transmitted back to the\n\nrequesting entity. There is a statutory bar from sharing biometric\n\ninformation (\nSection 29(1)(a)\n/\nSection 29(4)\n). Data centres of\n\nASA, requesting entities and CIDR should be within the territory\n\nof India. There are various other provisions for monitoring,\n\nauditing, inspection, limits on data sharing, data protection,\n\npunishments etc., grievance redressal mechanism, suspension\n\nand termination of services, etc. so that all actions the entities\n\ninvolved in the process are regulated.\nRegulation 3(i)\n& (j) of\n\nAadhaar (Data Security) Regulation, 2016 enables partitioning of\n\nCIDR network into zones based on risk and trust and other\n\nsecurity measures. CIDR being a computer resource is notified to\n\nbe a “Protected System” under\nSection 70\nof the IT Act by the\n\nCentral Government on December 11, 2015. Anyone trying to\n\nunlawfully gain access into this system is liable to be punished\n\nwith 10 years imprisonment and fine. The storage involves end to\n\nend encryption, logical partitioning, firewalling and anonymisation\n\nof decrypted biometric data. Breaches of penalty are made\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 239 of 567\n\npunitive by\nChapter VII of the Act\n. Biometric information is\n\ndeemed to be an “electronic record”, and “Sensitive personal data\n\nor information” under the\nIT Act\n. There are further guards under\n\nthe Aadhaar (Data Security) Regulations, 2016.\n\n152) That apart, we have recorded in detail the powerpoint\n\npresentation that was given by Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of\n\nthe Authority, which brings out the following salient features:\n\n(a) During the enrolment process, minimal biometric data in the\n\nform of iris and fingerprints is collected. The Authority does not\n\ncollect purpose, location or details of transaction. Thus, it is\n\npurpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains\n\nin silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is\n\nprovided answer only in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ about the authentication of\n\nthe person concerned. The authentication process is not\n\nexposed to the Internet world. Security measures, as per the\n\nprovisions of Section 29(3) read with Section 38(g) as well as\n\nRegulation 17(1)(d) of the Authentication Regulations are strictly\n\nfollowed and adhered to.\n\n(b) There are sufficient authentication security measures taken\n\nas well, as demonstrated in Slides 14, 28 and 29 of the\n\npresentation.\n\n(c) The Authority has sufficient defence mechanism, as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 240 of 567\n\nexplained in Slide 30. It has even taken appropriate protection\n\nmeasures as demonstrated in Slide 31.\n\n(d) There is an oversight by Technology and Architecture\n\nReview Board (TARB) and Security Review Committee.\n\n(e) During authentication no information about the nature of\n\ntransaction etc. is obtained.\n\n(f) The Authority has mandated use of Registered Devices\n\n(RD) for all authentication requests. With these, biometric data is\n\nsigned within the device/RD service using the provider key to\n\nensure it is indeed captured live. The device provider RD service\n\nencrypts the PID block before returning to the host application.\n\nThis RD service encapsulates the biometric capture, signing and\n\nencryption of biometrics all within it. Therefore, introduction of\n\nRD in Aadhaar authentication system rules out any possibility of\n\nuse of stored biometric and replay of biometrics captured from\n\nother source. Requesting entities are not legally allowed to store\n\nbiometrics captured for Aadhaar authentication under\nRegulation\n\n17(1)(a)\nof the Authentication Regulations.\n\n(g) The Authority gets the AUA code, ASA code, unique device\n\ncode, registered device code used for authentication. It does not\n\nget any information related to the IP address or the GPS location\n\nfrom where authentication is performed as these parameters are\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 241 of 567\n\nnot part of authentication (v2.0) and e-KYC (v2.1) API. The\n\nAuthority would only know from which device the authentication\n\nhas happened, through which AUA/ASA etc. It does not receive\n\nany information about at what location the authentication device\n\nis deployed, its IP address and its operator and the purpose of\n\nauthentication. Further, the authority or any entity under its\n\ncontrol is statutorily barred from collecting, keeping or maintaining\n\nany information about the purpose of authentication under\n\nSection 32(3) of the Aadhaar Act.\n\n153) After going through the Aadhaar structure, as demonstrated by\n\nthe respondents in the powerpoint presentation from the\n\nprovisions of the Aadhaar Act and the machinery which the\n\nAuthority has created for data protection, we are of the view that\n\nit is very difficult to create profile of a person simply on the basis\n\nof biometric and demographic information stored in CIDR. Insofar\n\nas authentication is concerned, the respondents rightly pointed\n\nout that there are sufficient safeguard mechanisms. To\n\nrecapitulate, it was specifically submitted that there were security\n\ntechnologies in place (slide 28 of Dr. Pandey’s presentation), 24/7\n\nsecurity monitoring, data leak prevention, vulnerability\n\nmanagement programme and independent audits (slide 29) as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 242 of 567\n\nwell as the Authority’s defence mechanism (slide 30). It was\n\nfurther pointed out that the Authority has taken appropriate pro-\n\nactive protection measures, which included disaster recovery\n\nplan, data backup and availability and media response plan (slide\n\n31). The respondents also pointed out that all security principles\n\nare followed inasmuch as: (a) there is PKI-2048 encryption from\n\nthe time of capture, meaning thereby, as soon as data is given at\n\nthe time of enrolment, there is an end to end encryption thereof\n\nand it is transmitted to the Authority in encrypted form. The said\n\nencryption is almost foolproof and it is virtually impossible to\n\ndecipher the same; (b) adoption of best-in-class security\n\nstandards and practices; and (c) strong audit and traceability as\n\nwell as fraud detection. Above all, there is an oversight of\n\nTechnology and Architecture Review Board (TARB) and Security\n\nReview Committee. This Board and Committee consist of very\n\nhigh profiled officers. Therefore, the Act has endeavoured to\n\nprovide safeguards67.\n\n67 We may also take on record responsible statements of the learned Attorney General and Mr.\nDwivedi who appeared for UIDAI that no State would be interested in any mass surveillance of\n1.2 Billion people of the country or even the overwhelming majority of officers and employees or\nprofessionals. The very idea of mass surveillance by State which pursues what an ANH does all\nthe time and based on Aadhaar is an absurdity and an impossibility. According to them, the\npetitioners submission is based on too many imaginary possibilities, viz.:\n\n(i) Aadhaar makes it possible for the State to obtain identity information of all ANH. It is\npossible that UIDAI would share identity information/authentication records in CIDR\nnotwithstanding statutory prohibition and punitive injunctions in the Act. It is possible that the\nState would unleash its investigators to surveil a sizeable section of the ANH, if not all based on\nthe authentication records. It is submitted that given the architecture of the Aadhaar Act, there\nare no such possibilities and in any event, submission based on imaginary possibility do not\nprovide any basis for questioning the validity of Aadhaar Act. (ii) None of the writ petitions set\nforth specific facts and even allegations that any Aadhaar number holder is being subjected to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 243 of 567\n\n154) Issue (b) relates to data protection. According to the petitioners\n\nthere is no data protection and there is a likelihood of misuse of\n\ndata/personal information of the individuals.\n\n155) The question to be determined is whether the safeguards\n\nprovided for the protection of personal biometric data in the\n\nAadhaar Act and Rules are sufficient. The crucial tasks that the\n\nCourt needs to undertake are – (i) to discuss the significance of\n\ndata in the world of technology and its impact; (ii) to determine\n\nthe magnitude of protection that should be accorded to collection,\n\nstorage and use of sensitive biometric data, so that they can\n\nqualify as proportionate; and (iii) to determine whether the\n\nAadhaar Act and Rules provide such data protection, thereby\n\nobviating any possibility of surveillance.\n\n(i) Significance of Data:\n\n156) Alvin Toffler in his illuminating article titled ‘What will our future be\n\nlike?’ has presented mind boggling ideas. Toffler traces the\n\ntransition – from agriculture society to industry society to\n\nknowledge based society. If we go back to the beginnings of time,\nsurveillance by UIDAI or the Union/States. The emphasis during the argument was only on the\npossibility of surveillance based on electronic track trails and authentication records. It was\nasserted that there are tools in the market for track back. The entire case was speculative and\nconjectural. In Clapper, Director of National Intelligence v. Amnesty International USA, the\nmajority judgment did not approve the submissions in the context of Foreign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act and one of the reason was that the allegations were conjectural and\nspeculative. There were no facts pleaded on the basis of which the asserted threat could be\nfairly traced to. However, we have not deliberated on this argument.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 244 of 567\n\nagriculture was the prime source and the entire mankind was\n\nbased on agriculture. 350 years later with the invention of steam\n\nengines came the industrialized age and now what we are living\n\nthrough is the third gigantic wave, which is way more powerful\n\nthan industrialized age. An age that is based on knowledge.\n\nToffler emphasises that in today’s society the only thing that leads\n\nto creation of wealth is knowledge. Unlike the past wherein\n\neconomics was described as the science of the allocation of\n\nscarce resources, today we are primarily dependent on\n\nknowledge and that is not a scarce resource. Times are\n\nchanging, we can no longer trust the straight line projection. His\n\nview is that we are going from a society which is more and more\n\nuniform to a highly de-massified society. Knowledge is power.\n\nWe are in the era of information. Probably what Toffler is hinting\n\nis that access to this vast reservoir of information is available in\n\ndigital world. Information is available online, at the touch of a\n\nbutton. With this, however, we usher into the regime of data.\n\n157) In a recent speech by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of\n\nIsrael, while talking about innovation and entrepreneurship, he\n\nbrought out an interesting phenomena in the world of free market\n\nprinciples, i.e. in the era of globalisation, in the following words:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 245 of 567\n\n“Look at the ten leading companies in 2006, five energy\ncompanies, one IT company Microsoft and a mere ten\nyears later, in 2016, a blink of an eye, in historical terms, its\ncompletely reversed, five IT companies one energy\ncompany left. The true wealth is in innovation - you know\nthese companies - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon,\nFacebook.”\n\n158) He adds by making a significant statement as the reason behind\n\nthis change:\n\n“...there is a reason something is going on, it’s a great\nchange - you want to hear a jargan – it’s a one sentence,\nthis is a terrible sentence, but I have no other way to say,\nit’s a confluence of big data, connectivity and artificial\nintelligence. Ok, you get that? You know what that does – it\nrevolutionises old industries and it creates entirely new\nindustries, so here is an old industry that Israel was always\ngreat in – Agriculture. We are always good in agriculture\nbut now we have precision agriculture. You know what that\nis? See that drone in the sky is connected to a big\ndatabase and there is sensor at the field and in the field\nthere is drip irrigation and drip fertilization and now we can\ntarget with this technology the water that we give, the\nfertilizer that we give down to the individual plant that\nneeds it. That’s precision agriculture, that’s Israel.\nUnbelievable.”\n\n159) This brings us to the world of data – big data. It has its own\n\nadvantages of tremendous nature. It is making life of people\n\neasier. People can connect with each other even when they are\n\nlocated at places far away from each other. Not only they can\n\nconverse with each other but can even see each other while\n\ntalking. There is a wealth of information available on different\n\nnetworks to which they can easily access and satisfy their quest\n\nfor knowledge within seconds by getting an answer. People can\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 246 of 567\n\nmove from one place to the other with the aid of Global\n\nPositioning System (GPS). They can hear music and watch\n\nmovies on their handy gadgets, including smart cellphones. We\n\nare in the age of digital economy which has enabled multiple\n\navenues for a common man. Internet access is becoming\n\ncheaper by the day, which can be accessed not only through the\n\nmedium of desktop computers or laptops and even other handy\n\ngadgets like smart phones. Electronic transactions like online\n\nshopping, bill payments, movie/train/air ticket bookings, funds\n\ntransfer, e-wallet payments, online banking and online insurance\n\netc. are happening with extreme ease at the touch of a finger.\n\nSuch tasks can be undertaken sitting in drawing rooms. Even\n\nwhile travelling from one place to the other in their car, they can\n\nindulge in all the aforesaid activities. In that sense, technology\n\nhas made their life so easy.\n\n160) However, there is another side to do as well, like any coin which\n\nhas two sides. The use of such technologies is at the cost of\n\ngiving away personal information, which is in the realm of privacy.\n\nIn order to connect with such technologies and avail their\n\nbenefits, the users are parting with their biometric information like\n\nfingerprints and iris as well as demographic information like their\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 247 of 567\n\nnames, parentage, family members, their age, even personal\n\ninformation like their sex, blood group or even the ailments they\n\nare suffering from. Not only this, use of aforesaid facilities on net\n\nor any portal like Apple, Google, Facebook etc. involves tracking\n\ntheir movements, including the nature of activities, like the kind of\n\nshopping, the places from where shopping is done, the actual\n\nmoney spent thereon, the nature of movies watched etc. All this\n\ndata is there with the companies in respect of its users which may\n\neven turn into metadata. In fact, cases after cases are reported\n\nwhere such data of users is parted with various purposes.\n\nInterestingly, for using such facilities, people knowingly and\n\nwillingly, are ready to part with their vital personal information.\n\nEvery transaction on a digital platform is linked with some form of\n\nsensitive personal information. It can be an individual’s user\n\nname, password, account number, PAN number, biometric\n\ndetails, e-mail ID, debit/credit card number, CVV number and\n\ntransaction OTP etc.\n\n161) These have raised concerns about the privacy and protection of\n\ndata, which has become a matter of great concern. Problem is\n\nnot limited to data localisation but has become extra-territorial.\n\nThere are issues of cross-border transfers of personal data,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 248 of 567\n\nregulation whereof is again a big challenge with which various\n\nopinions are grappling. There are even talks of convergence of\n\nregulatory regime in this behalf so that uniform approach is\n\nadopted in providing a legal ecosystem to regulate cross-border\n\ndata transfer. Asian Business Law Institute (ABLI), in\n\ncollaboration with Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) has, after\n\nundertaking in-depth study, compiled 14 country reports in their\n\nrespective jurisdictions on the regulation of cross-border data\n\ntransfer and data localisation in Asia.\n\n162) In the aforesaid scenario, interesting issue is posed by the\n\nrespondents, viz., when so much personal information about\n\npeople is already available in public domain, how can there be an\n\nexpectancy of data privacy. That aspect is dealt with while\n\ndiscussing the issue of privacy. Here, we are concerned with\n\ndata protection under Aadhaar that is available with the State. As\n\npointed out above, even in respect of private players, the data\n\nprotection has become a matter of serious concern. When it\n\ncomes to the State or the instrumentality of the State, the matter\n\nhas to be taken with all seriousness, on the touchstone of\n\nconstitutionalism and the concept of limited Government.\n\n(ii) Law on Data Protection:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 249 of 567\n\n163) In order to determine this aspect, i.e. the nature and magnitude of\n\ndata protection that is required to enable legal collection and use\n\nof biometric data, reliance can be placed on – (a) various existing\n\nlegislations – both in India and across the world; and (b) case law\n\nincluding the judgment in K.S. Puttaswamy.\n\n(a) Legislation in India:\n\n(i)\nInformation Technology Act\n, 2000\n\nThe only existing legislation covering data protection related\n\nto biometric information are\nSection 43A\nand\nSection 72A\nof the\n\nIT Act and the Information Technology (Reasonable Security\n\nPractices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or\n\nInformation) Rules, 2011 (hereinafter “Sensitive Personal Data\n\nRules”). Although the IT Act and Rules do not determine the\n\nconstitutionality of use of biometric data and information by the\n\nAadhaar Act and Rules, they are instructive in determining the\n\nsafeguards that must be taken to collect biometric information 68.\n\n164) Following are the provisions which cover biometric information\n\nunder the\nIT Act\n:\n\nSection 43A\nof the IT Act attaches liability to a body\n\ncorporate, which is possessing, handling and dealing with any\n\n68 A challenge to the Aadhaar project for violation of\nIT Act\nand Rules has been filed in the Delhi\nHigh Court in the matter of Shamnad Basheer v UIDAI and Ors. Therefore, we are not dealing\nwith this aspect, nor does it arise for consideration in these proceedings.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 250 of 567\n\n‘sensitive personal information or data’ and is negligent in\n\nimplementing and maintaining reasonable security practices\n\nresulting in wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person.\n\n‘Sensitive personal information or data’ is defined under Rule 3 of\n\nthe Sensitive Personal Data Rules to include information relating\n\nto biometric data.\nSection 43A\nreads as follows:\n\n“43A. Compensation for failure to protect data. -Where\na body corporate, possessing, dealing or handling any\nsensitive personal data or information in a computer\nresource which it owns, controls or operates, is negligent in\nimplementing and maintaining reasonable security\npractices and procedures and thereby causes wrongful\nloss or wrongful gain to any person, such body corporate\nshall be liable to pay damages by way of compensation to\nthe person so affected.\n\nExplanation. -For the purposes of this section,-\n\n(i) \"body corporate\" means any company and includes\na firm, sole proprietorship or other association of\nindividuals engaged in commercial or professional\nactivities;\n\n(ii) \"reasonable security practices and procedures\"\n\nmeans security practices and procedures designed to\nprotect such information from unauthorised access,\ndamage, use, modification, disclosure or impairment, as\nmay be specified in an agreement between the parties or\nas may be specified in any law for the time being in force\nand in the absence of such agreement or any law, such\nreasonable security practices and procedures, as may be\nprescribed by the Central Government in consultation with\nsuch professional bodies or associations as it may deem\nfit;\n\n(iii) \"sensitive personal data or information\" means such\npersonal information as may be prescribed by the Central\nGovernment in consultation with such professional bodies\nor associations as it may deem fit.]”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 251 of 567\n\n165) Similarly,\nSection 72A\nof the IT Act makes intentional disclosure\n\nof ‘personal information’ obtained under a contract, without\n\nconsent of the parties concerned and in breach of a lawful\n\ncontract, punishable with imprisonment and fine. Rule 2(i) of the\n\nSensitive Personal Data Rules define \"personal information\" to\n\nmean any information that relates to a natural person, which,\n\neither directly or indirectly, in combination with other information\n\navailable or likely to be available with a body corporate, is\n\ncapable of identifying such person. Thus, biometrics will form a\n\npart of “personal information”. The Section reads as under-\n\n“72A. Punishment for disclosure of information in\nbreach of lawful contract - Save as otherwise provided in\nthis Act or any other law for the time being in force, any\nperson including an intermediary who, while providing\nservices under the terms of lawful contract, has secured\naccess to any material containing personal information\nabout another person, with the intent to cause or knowing\nthat he is likely to cause wrongful loss or wrongful gain\ndiscloses, without the consent of the person concerned, or\nin breach of a lawful contract, such material to any other\nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term\nwhich may extend to three years, or with fine which may\nextend to five lakh rupees, or with both.”\n\n166) The Sensitive Personal Data Rules provide for additional\n\nrequirements on commercial and business entities (body\n\ncorporates as defined under\nSection 43A\nof the IT Act) relating to\n\nthe collection and disclosure of sensitive personal data (including\n\nbiometric information). The crucial requirements, which are\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 252 of 567\n\nindicative of the principles for data protection that India adheres\n\nto, inter alia include:\n\n(i) The body corporate or any person who on behalf of body\n\ncorporate collects, receives, possesses, stores, deals or handle\n\ninformation of provider of information, shall provide a privacy\n\npolicy for handling of or dealing in personal information including\n\nsensitive personal data or information and ensure that the same\n\nare available for view.\n\n(ii) Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall obtain\n\nconsent in writing from the provider of the sensitive personal data\n\nor information regarding purpose of usage before collection of\n\nsuch information.\n\n(iii) Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall not collect\n\nsensitive personal data or information unless — (a) the\n\ninformation is collected for a lawful purpose connected with a\n\nfunction or activity of the body corporate or any person on its\n\nbehalf; and (b) the collection of the sensitive personal data or\n\ninformation is considered necessary for that purpose\n\n(iv) The person concerned has the knowledge of — (a) the fact\n\nthat the information is being collected; (b) the purpose for which\n\nthe information is being collected; (c) the intended recipients of\n\nthe information; and (d) name and address of the agency\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 253 of 567\n\ncollecting and retaining the information.\n\n(v) Body corporate or any person on its behalf holding sensitive\n\npersonal data or information shall not retain that information for\n\nlonger than is required for the purposes for which the information\n\nmay lawfully be used or is otherwise required under any other law\n\nfor the time being in force.\n\n(vi) Information collected shall be used for the purpose for\n\nwhich it has been collected.\n\n(vii) Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall, prior to the\n\ncollection of information, including sensitive personal data or\n\ninformation, provide an option to the provider of the information to\n\nnot to provide the data or information sought to be collected.\n\n(viii) Body corporate shall address any discrepancies and\n\ngrievances of their provider of the information with respect to\n\nprocessing of information in a time bound manner.\n\n(ix) Disclosure of sensitive personal data or information by body\n\ncorporate to any third party shall require prior permission from the\n\nprovider of such information, who has provided such information\n\nunder lawful contract or otherwise, unless such disclosure has\n\nbeen agreed to in the contract between the body corporate and\n\nprovider of information, or where the disclosure is necessary for\n\ncompliance of a legal obligation.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 254 of 567\n\n(x) A body corporate or a person on its behalf shall comply with\n\nreasonable security practices and procedure i.e. implement such\n\nsecurity practices and standards and have a comprehensive\n\ndocumented information security programme and information\n\nsecurity policies that contain managerial, technical, operational\n\nand physical security control measures that are commensurate\n\nwith the information assets being protected with the nature of\n\nbusiness. In the event of an information security breach, the\n\nbody corporate or a person on its behalf shall be required to\n\ndemonstrate, as and when called upon to do so by the agency\n\nmandated under the law, that they have implemented security\n\ncontrol measures as per their documented information security\n\nprogramme and information security policies.\n\nThe above substantive and procedural safeguards are\n\nrequired for legal collection, storage and use of biometric\n\ninformation under the\nIT Act\n. They indicate the rigour with which\n\nsuch processes need to be carried out.\n\nPosition in other countries:\n\n(a) EUGDPR (European Union General Data Protection\nRegulation)69\n\n69 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free\nmovement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 255 of 567\n\nEUGDPR which was enacted by the EU in 2016 came into\n\nforce on May 25, 2018 replacing the Data Protection Directive of\n\n1995. It is an exhaustive and comprehensive legal framework that\n\nis aimed at protection of natural persons from the processing of\n\npersonal data and their right to informational privacy. It deals with\n\nall kinds of processing of personal data while delineating rights of\n\ndata subjects and obligations of data processors in detail. The\n\nfollowing fundamental principles of data collection, processing,\n\nstorage and use reflect the proportionality principle underpinning\n\nthe EUGDPR -\n\n(i) the personal data shall be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a\n\ntransparent manner in relation to the data subject (principle of\n\nlawfulness, fairness, and transparency);\n\n(ii) the personal data must be collected for specified, explicit,\n\nand legitimate purposes (principle of purpose limitation);\n\n(iii) processing must also be adequate, relevant, and limited to\n\nwhat is necessary (principle of data minimization) as well as\n\naccurate and, where necessary, kept up to date (principle of\n\naccuracy);\n\n(iv) data is to be kept in a form that permits identification of data\n\nsubjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 256 of 567\n\nwhich the personal data are processed (principle of storage\n\nlimitation);\n\n(v) data processing must be secure (principle of integrity and\n\nconfidentiality); and\n\n(vi) data controller is to be held responsible (principle of\n\naccountability).\n\n167) The EUGDPR under\nArticle 9\nprohibits the collection of biometric\n\ndata unless except in few circumstances which include (but are\n\nnot limited to) -\n\n(a) there is an explicit consent by the party whose data is being\n\ncollected. The consent should be freely given, which is clearly\n\ndistinguishable in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using\n\nclear and plain language. This consent can be withdrawn at any\n\ntime without affecting the actions prior to the withdrawal;\n\n(b) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the\n\nobligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the\n\ndata subject in the field of employment and social security and\n\nsocial protection law;\n\n(c) processing relates to personal data which is manifestly\n\nmade public by the data subject; and\n\n(d) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 257 of 567\n\ninterest, and it shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect\n\nthe essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable\n\nand specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and\n\nthe interests of the data subject.\n\n168) The Regulation also institutes rights of the data subject (the\n\nperson whose data is collected), subject to exceptions, which\n\ninclude the data subject’s right of access to information about the\n\npurpose of collection of data, details of data controller and\n\nsubsequent use and transfer of data, the data subject’s right to\n\nrectification of data, right to erasure or right to be forgotten, the\n\ndata subject’s right to restriction of processing, the right to be\n\ninformed, the right to data portability and the data subject’s right\n\nto object to illegitimate use of data.\n\n(b) Biometric Privacy Act in the United States of America\n\n169) Some States in the United States of America have laws\n\nregulating collection and use of biometric information. Illinois has\n\npassed Biometric Information Privacy Act (740 ILCS 14/1 or\n\nBIPA) in 2008. Texas has also codified the law for capture of use\n\nof biometric identifier (Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. §503.001) in\n\n2009. The Governor of the Washington State signed into law\n\nHouse Bill 1493 (“H.B. 1493”) on May 16, 2017, which sets forth\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 258 of 567\n\nrequirements for businesses who collect and use biometric\n\nidentifiers for commercial purposes. BIPA, Illinois, for example\n\nmakes it unlawful for private entities to collect, store, or use\n\nbiometric information, such as retina/iris scans, voice scans, face\n\nscans, or fingerprints, without first obtaining individual consent for\n\nsuch activities. BIPA also requires that covered entities take\n\nspecific precautions to secure the information.\n\n(b) Case Laws:\n\n170) In K.S. Puttaswamy’s judgment, all the Judges highlighted the\n\nimportance of informational privacy in the age of easy access,\n\ntransfer, storage and mining of data. The means of aggregation\n\nand analysis of data of individuals through various tools are\n\nexplained. Chandrachud, J. observed that with the increasing\n\nubiquity of electronic devices, information can be accessed,\n\nstored and disseminated without notice to the individual.\n\nMetadata and data mining make the individual’s personal\n\ninformation subject to private companies and the state. In this\n\nbackground, His Lordship discusses the necessity of a data\n\nprotection regime for safeguarding privacy and protecting the\n\nautonomy of the individual. The following observations in the\n\nconclusion of the judgment are worth quoting:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 259 of 567\n\n“328. Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy.\n\nThe dangers to privacy in an age of information can\noriginate not only from the state but from non-state actors\nas well. We commend to the Union Government the need\nto examine and put into place a robust regime for data\nprotection. The creation of such a regime requires a careful\nand sensitive balance between individual interests and\nlegitimate concerns of the state. The legitimate aims of the\nstate would include for instance protecting national\nsecurity, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging\ninnovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing\nthe dissipation of social welfare benefits. These are matters\nof policy to be considered by the Union government while\ndesigning a carefully structured regime for the protection of\nthe data. Since the Union government has informed the\nCourt that it has constituted a Committee chaired by\nHon’ble Shri Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge of this\nCourt, for that purpose, the matter shall be dealt with\nappropriately by the Union government having due regard\nto what has been set out in this judgment.”\n\n171) S.K. Kaul, J. cited the European Union General Data Protection\n\nRegulations70 to highlight the importance of data protection and\n\nthe circumstances in which restrictions on the right to privacy may\n\nbe justifiable subject to the principle of proportionality. These\n\ninclude balance against other fundamental rights, legitimate\n\nnational security interest, public interest including scientific or\n\nhistorical research purposes or statistical purposes, criminal\n\noffences, tax purposes, etc.\n\n172) There are numerous case laws – both American and European –\n\npresented by the petitioners and the respondents with respect to\n\n70 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the\nprotection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free\nmovement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 260 of 567\n\nthe collection, storage and use of biometric data which have been\n\ntaken note of above. They are illustrative of the method and\n\nsafeguards required to satisfy the proportionality principle while\n\ndealing with biometric data. The first set of cases cited by the\n\npetitioners are cases from European Human Rights Courts.\n\n173) The European Human Rights legislations have both explicitly and\n\nthrough case laws recognized the right to informational privacy\n\nand data protection. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights\n\nstates in\nArticle 7\nthat ‘everyone has the right to respect for his or\n\nher private and family life, home and communications’ and in\n\nArticle 8\nit grants a fundamental right to protection of personal\n\ndata. The first article of the EU Charter affirms the right to respect\n\nand protection of human dignity. The ECHR also recognises the\n\nright to respect for private and family life, home and his\n\ncorrespondence which have been read to include protection of\n\nright to control over personal biometric information.\n\n174) As pointed out above as well, a prominent case which addresses\n\nthe question of storage of biometric data, i.e. whether storage\n\nand retention of DNA samples and fingerprints violates\nArticle 8\nof\n\nthe ECHR, is S and Marper71. In this case, the storing of DNA\n\n71 S and Marper v. United Kingdom [2008] ECHR 1581\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 261 of 567\n\nprofiles and cellular samples of any person arrested in the United\n\nKingdom was challenged before the ECtHR. Even if the individual\n\nwas never charged or if criminal proceedings were discontinued\n\nor if the person was later acquitted of any crime, their DNA profile\n\ncould nevertheless be kept permanently on record without their\n\nconsent.\n\n175) In a unanimous verdict, the seventeen-judge bench held that\n\nthere had been a violation of\nArticle 8\nof the ECHR. Fingerprints,\n\nDNA profiles and cellular samples, constituted personal data and\n\ntheir retention was capable of affecting private life of an\n\nindividual. The retention of such data without consent, thus,\n\nconstitutes violation of\nArticle 8\nas they relate to identified and\n\nidentifiable individuals. It held that:\n\n“84. …fingerprints objectively contain unique information\nabout the individual concerned allowing his or her\nidentification with precision in a wide range of\ncircumstances. They are thus capable of affecting his or\nher private life and retention of this information without the\nconsent of the individual concerned cannot be regarded as\nneutral or insignificant.”\n\n176) It articulated the proportionality principle in the following words:\n\n“101. An interference will be considered “necessary in a\ndemocratic society” for a legitimate aim if it answers a\n“pressing social need” and, in particular, if it is\nproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued and if the\nreasons adduced by the national authorities to justify it are\n\"relevant and sufficient\n\nxx xx xx\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 262 of 567\n\nThe protection of personal data is of fundamental\nimportance to a person's enjoyment of his or her right to\nrespect for private and family life, as guaranteed by\nArticle\nof the Convention. The domestic law must afford\nappropriate safeguards to prevent any such use of\npersonal data as may be inconsistent with the guarantees\nof this Article. The need for such safeguards is all the\ngreater where the protection of personal data undergoing\nautomatic processing is concerned, not least when such\ndata are used for police purposes. The domestic law\nshould notably ensure that such data are relevant and not\nexcessive in relation to the purposes for which they are\nstored; and preserved in a form which permits identification\nof the data subjects for no longer than is required for the\npurpose for which those data are stored … The domestic\nlaw must also afford adequate guarantees that retained\npersonal data was efficiently protected from misuse and\nabuse.”\n\n177) The issue in the case according to the Court was whether the\n\nretention of the fingerprints and DNA data of the applicants, as\n\npersons who had been suspected but not convicted of certain\n\ncriminal offences, was justified under\nArticle 8\nof the Convention.\n\n178) The Court held that such invasion of privacy was not\n\nproportionate as it was not “necessary in a democratic society” as\n\nit did not fulfill any pressing social need. The blanket and\n\nindiscriminate nature of retention of data was excessive and did\n\nnot strike a balance between private and public interest. It held:\n\n“125. the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the powers\nof retention of the fingerprints, cellular samples and DNA\nprofiles of persons suspected but not convicted of offences,\nas applied in the case of the present applicants, fails to\nstrike a fair balance between the competing public and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 263 of 567\n\nprivate interests and that the respondent State has\noverstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this\nregard. Accordingly, the retention at issue constitutes a\ndisproportionate interference with the applicants' right to\nrespect for private life and cannot be regarded as\nnecessary in a democratic society. This conclusion\nobviates the need for the Court to consider the applicants'\ncriticism regarding the adequacy of certain particular\nsafeguards, such as too broad an access to the personal\ndata concerned and insufficient protection against the\nmisuse or abuse of such data.”\n\n179) The two crucial aspects of the case that need to be kept in mind\n\nare – First, in that case, the fingerprints were collected for\n\ncriminal purposes and without the consent of the individual to\n\nwhom the fingerprints belonged. Second, the fingerprints were to\n\nbe stored indefinitely without the consent of the individual and\n\nthat the individual did not have an option to seek deletion. These\n\naspects were vital for the Court to decide that the retention\n\nviolated the citizen’s right to privacy.\n\n180) Similarly, in the Digital Ireland case72, the European Parliament\n\nand the Council of the European Union adopted Directive\n\n2006/24/EC (Directive), which regulated Internet Service\n\nProviders’ storage of telecommunications data. It could be used\n\nto retain data which was generated or processed in connection\n\nwith the provision of publicly available electronic communications\n\nservices or of public communications network, for the purpose of\n\n72 Digital Rights Ireland Ltd v Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources [2014] All\nER (D) 66 (Apr)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 264 of 567\n\nfighting serious crime in the European Union. The data included\n\ndata necessary to trace and identify the source of communication\n\nand its destination, to identify the date, time duration, type of\n\ncommunication, IP address, telephone number and other fields.\n\nThe Court of Justice of European Court (CJEU) evaluated the\n\ncompatibility of the Directive with\nArticles 7\nand\nof the Charter\n\nand declared the Directive to be invalid.\n\n181) According to the CJEU, the Directive interfered with the right to\n\nrespect for private life under\nArticle 7\nand with the right to the\n\nprotection of personal data under\nArticle 8\nof the Charter of\n\nFundamental Rights of the European Union. It allowed very\n\nprecise conclusion to be drawn concerning the private lives of the\n\npersons whose data had been retained, such as habits of\n\neveryday life, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily\n\nand other movements, activities carried out, social relationships\n\nand so on. The invasion of right was not proportionate to the\n\nlegitimate aim pursued for the following reasons:\n\n(i) Absence of limitation of data retention pertaining to a\n\nparticular time period and/or a particular geographical zone\n\nand/or to a circle of particular persons likely to be involved.\n\n(ii) Absence of objective criterion, substantive and procedural\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 265 of 567\n\nconditions to determine the limits of access of the competent\n\nnational authorities to the data and their subsequent use for the\n\npurposes of prevention, detection or criminal prosecutions. There\n\nwas no prior review carried out by a court or by an independent\n\nadministrative body whose decision sought to limit access to the\n\ndata and their use to what is strictly necessary for attaining the\n\nobjective pursued.\n\n(iii) Absence of distinction being made between the categories\n\nof data collected based on their possible usefulness.\n\n(iv) Period of retention i.e. 6 months was very long being not\n\nbased on an objective criterion.\n\n(v) Absence of rules to protect data retained against the risk of\n\nabuse and against any unlawful access and use of that data.\n\n(vi) Directive does not require the data in question to be\n\nretained within the European Union.\n\n182) In Tele2 Sverige AB vs. Post-och telestyrelsen73, the CJEU was\n\nseized with the issue as to whether in light of Digital Rights\n\nIreland, a national law which required a provider of electronic\n\ncommunications services to retain meta-data (name, address,\n\ntelephone number and IP address) regarding users/subscribers\n\nfor the purpose of fighting crime was contrary to Article 7, 8 and\n\n73 Tele2 Sverige AB v. Post-och telestyrelsen and Secretary of State for the Home Department v.\nTom Watson, Peter Brice, Geoffrey Lewis, Joined Cases C-203/15 and C-698/15, 2016\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 266 of 567\n\n11 of the EU Charter. The CJEU struck down the provision\n\nallowing collection of such meta data on grounds of lack of\n\npurpose limitation, data differentiation, data protection, prior\n\nreview by a court or administrative authority and consent,\n\namongst other grounds. It held:\n\n“103. While the effectiveness of the fight against serious\ncrime, in particular organised crime and terrorism (…)\ncannot in itself justify that national legislation providing for\nthe general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and\nlocation data should be considered to be necessary for the\npurposes of that fight.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n105. Second, national legislation (…) provides for no\ndifferentiation, limitation or exception according to the\nobjective pursued. It is comprehensive in that it affects all\npersons using electronic communication services, even\nthough those persons are not, even indirectly, in a situation\nthat is liable to give rise to criminal proceedings. It\ntherefore applies even to persons for whom there is no\nevidence capable of suggesting that their conduct might\nhave a link, even an indirect or remote one, with serious\ncriminal offences. Further, it does not provide for any\nexception, and consequently it applies even to persons\nwhose communications are subject, according to rules of\nnational law, to the obligation of professional secrecy.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nif it is to be ensured that data retention is limited to what is\nstrictly necessary, it must be observed that, while those\nconditions may vary according to the nature of the\nmeasures taken for the purposes of prevention,\ninvestigation, detection and prosecution of serious crime,\nthe retention of data must continue nonetheless to meet\nobjective criteria, that establish a connection between the\ndata to be retained and the objective pursued. In particular,\nsuch conditions must be shown to be such as actually to\ncircumscribe, in practice, the extent of that measure and,\nthus, the public affected.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 267 of 567\n\n183) With respect to measures for data security and data protection\n\nthe court held :\n\n“122. Those provisions require those providers to take\nappropriate technical and organisational measures to\nensure the effective protection of retained data against\nrisks of misuse and against any unlawful access to that\ndata. Given the quantity of retained data, the sensitivity of\nthat data and the risk of unlawful access to it, the providers\nof electronic communications services must, in order to\nensure the full integrity and confidentiality of that data,\nguarantee a particularly high level of protection and\nsecurity by means of appropriate technical and\norganisational measures. In particular, the national\nlegislation must make provision for the data to be retained\nwithin the European Union and for the irreversible\ndestruction of the data at the end of the data retention\nperiod.”\n\n184) In BVerfG74, the German Constitutional Court rendered on March\n\n02, 2010 a decision by which provisions of the data retention\n\nlegislation adopted for, inter alia, the prevention of crime were\n\nrendered void because of lack of criteria for rendering the data\n\nretention proportional.\n\n185) In Maximillian Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner75, the\n\nCJEU struck down the transatlantic US-EU Safe Harbor\n\nagreement that enabled companies to transfer data from Europe\n\nto the United States on the ground that there was not an\n\nadequate level of safeguard to protect the data. It held that the\n\n74 2.03. 2010, 1 BvR 256 / 08 , 1 BvR 263 / 08 , 1 BvR 586 / 08\n75 [2016] 2 W.L.R. 873\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 268 of 567\n\nU.S. authorities could access the data beyond what was strictly\n\nnecessary and proportionate to the protection of national security.\n\nThe subject had no administrative or judicial means of accessing,\n\nrectifying or erasing their data.\n\n186) In Szabo and Vissy v. Hungary76, the ECtHR held unanimously\n\nthat there had been a violation of\nArticle 8 (right to respect for\n\nprivate\nand family life, the home and correspondence) of the\n\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. The case concerned\n\nHungarian legislation on secret anti-terrorist surveillance\n\nintroduced in 2011. The court held that the legislation in question\n\ndid not have sufficient safeguards to avoid abuse. Notably, the\n\nscope of the measures could include virtually anyone in Hungary,\n\nwith new technologies enabling the Government to intercept\n\nmasses of data easily concerning even persons outside the\n\noriginal range of operation. Furthermore, the ordering of such\n\nmeasures was taking place entirely within the realm of the\n\nexecutive and without an assessment of whether interception of\n\ncommunications was strictly necessary. There were no effective\n\nremedial measures in place, let alone judicial ones. The court\n\nheld:\n\n“77. … Rule of law implies, inter alia, that an interference\nby the executive authorities with an individual right should\n76 Eur. Ct. H.R. 2016\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 269 of 567\n\nbe subject to an effective control which should normally be\nassured by the judiciary, at least in the last resort…”\n\n187) Thus, it is evident from various case laws cited above, that data\n\ncollection, usage and storage (including biometric data) in Europe\n\nrequires adherence to the principles of consent, purpose and\n\nstorage limitation, data differentiation, data exception, data\n\nminimization, substantive and procedural fairness and\n\nsafeguards, transparency, data protection and security. Only by\n\nsuch strict observance of the above principles can the State\n\nsuccessfully discharge the burden of proportionality while\n\naffecting the privacy rights of its citizens.\n\n188) The jurisprudence with respect to collection, use and retention of\n\nbiometric information in the United States differs from the EU. In\n\nthe US context, there is no comprehensive data protection\n\nregime. This is because of the federal system of American\n\ngovernment, there are multiple levels of law\n\nenforcement―federal, state, and local. Different states have\n\ndiffering standards for informational privacy. Moreover, the U.S.\n\nhas a sectoral approach to privacy, i.e. laws and regulations\n\nrelated to data differ in different sectors such as health sector or\n\nstudent sector. In most cases, however, the Fourth Amendment\n\nwhich prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” by the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 270 of 567\n\ngovernment has been read by courts to envisage various levels\n\ndata protection.\n\n189) At this juncture, we are not entering the debate as to whether the\n\njurisprudence developed in United States is to be preferred or\n\nE.U. approach would be more suitable. Fact remains that\n\nimportance to data protection in processing the data of the\n\ncitizens is an accepted norm.\n\n190) Observance of this fundamental principle is necessary to prevent\n\na disproportionate infringement of the Fundamental Right of\n\nPrivacy of a citizen. The question which now needs to be\n\naddressed is whether the Aadhaar Act and Rules incorporate\n\nthese principles of data protection. We have already taken note\n\nof the provisions in the Act, which relate to data protection.\n\nHowever, a detailed analysis of the provisions of the Act needs to\n\nbe undertaken for this purpose having regard to the principles\n\nthat have emerged from case law in other jurisdiction and noted\n\nin paragraph 187 above.\n\nData Minimisation:\n\n191) The petitioners have argued that the Act enables data collection\n\nindiscriminately regarding all aspects of a person (biometrics,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 271 of 567\n\ndemographic details, authentication records, meta-data related to\n\ntransaction) even though such data has no nexus to the\n\npurported object of subsidies, thus violating the principle of data\n\nminimization. The data collected is sufficient to indicate religion,\n\nclass, social status, income, education and intimate personal\n\ndetails. Under\nSection 32\nof the Act, authentication records are\n\nstored in the central database in the manner prescribed under the\n\nRegulations.\nRegulation 26\nof the Authentication Regulations\n\nrequires UIDAI to store “authentication transaction data”\n\nconsisting of: (a) authentication request data received including\n\nPID block; (b) authentication response data sent; (c) meta data\n\nrelated to the transaction; and (d) any authentication server side\n\nconfigurations as necessary. The authentication record affords\n\naccess to information that can be used and analyzed to\n\nsystematically track or profile an individual and her activities.\n\n192) As per the respondents, Aadhaar involves minimal identity\n\ninformation for effective authentication. Four types of information\n\ncollected for providing Aadhaar:\n\n(i) Mandatory demographic information comprising name, date of\n\nbirth, address and gender [\nSection 2(k)\nread with\nRegulation 4(1)\n\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016];\n\n(ii) Optional demographic information [\nSection 2(k)\nread with\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 272 of 567\n\nRegulation 4(2)\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\nRegulations, 2016];\n\n(iii) Non-core biometric information comprising photograph;\n\n(iv) Core biometric information comprising finger print and iris\n\nscan.\n\n193) Demographic information, both mandatory and optional, and\n\nphotographs does not raise a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nunless under special circumstances such as\n\njuveniles in conflict of law or a rape victim’s identity. Today, all\n\nglobal ID cards contain photographs for identification alongwith\n\naddress, date of birth, gender etc. The demographic information\n\nis readily provided by individuals globally for disclosing identity\n\nwhile relating with others and while seeking benefits whether\n\nprovided by government or by private entities, be it registration for\n\ncitizenship, elections, passports, marriage or enrolment in\n\neducational institutions. Email ids and phone numbers are also\n\navailable in public domain, For example in telephone directories.\n\nAadhaar Act only uses demographic information which are not\n\nsensitive and where no reasonable expectation of privacy exists -\n\nname, date of birth, address, gender, mobile number and e mail\n\naddress.\nSection 2(k)\nspecifically provides that Regulations\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 273 of 567\n\ncannot include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language,\n\nrecords of entitlement, income or medical history. Thus, sensitive\n\ninformation specifically stand excluded.\n\n194) We find that Section 32 (3) of the Aadhaar Act specifically\n\nprohibits the authority from collecting, storing or maintaining,\n\neither directly or indirectly any information about the purpose of\n\nauthentication. The proviso to\nRegulation 26\nof Authentication\n\nRegulations is also to the same effect.\n\n195) Thus, the principle of data minimization is largely followed.\n\n196) With this, we advert to some other provisions, challenge whereof\n\nis based on threat to security of the data. These are\nSection 2(c)\n,\n\nSection 2(g)\nand\nSection 2(h)\nread with Section 10 of the\n\nAadhaar Act.\nSection 2(c)\npertains to authentication. It is a\n\nprocess by which Aadhaar number along with demographic\n\ninformation or biometric information of an individual is submitted\n\nto the CIDR for its verification. On submission thereof, the CIDR\n\nverifies the correctness or lack of it. CIDR is defined in\nSection\n\n2(h)\n.\nSection 10\nlays down that the Authority may engage one or\n\nmore entities to establish or maintain the CIDR and to perform\n\nany other functions as may be specified by regulations.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 274 of 567\n\n197) Insofar as authentication process is concerned, that has already\n\nbeen taken note of above. The manner in which it is explained by\n\nthe respondent authority, that may not pose much of a problem.\n\nAs noted earlier, while seeking authentication, neither the location\n\nof the person whoso identity is to be verified nor the purpose for\n\nwhich authentication of such identity is needed, comes to the\n\nknowledge of the Authority and, therefore, such data collected by\n\nthe Authority. Therefore, the threat to real time surveillance and\n\nprofiling may be far-fetched. The respondents have explained\n\nthat\nSection 2(d)\ndefines “authentication record” to mean the\n\nrecord of the time of authentication, identity of the RE and the\n\nresponse provided by the authority”,\nRegulation 26 (a)\nto (d) does\n\nnot go beyond the scope of\nSection 2(d)\n. None of the four\n\nclauses of\nRegulation 26\nentitle the authority to store data about\n\nthe purpose for which authentication is being done. The device\n\ncan therefore only tell the authority the identity of the RE, the PID,\n\nthe time and nature of response, the code of the device and the\n\nauthentication server side configurations. Identity of the RE does\n\nnot include details of the organization which is seeking\n\nauthentication as an RE provides authentication service to large\n\nnumber of government organizations who have agreements with\n\nit. Such a mechanism preventing the authority from tracking the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 275 of 567\n\nnature of activity for which the authentication was required. To\n\nillustrate nic.in is an RE which provides authentication service to\n\nlarge number of Government organisations who have\n\nagreements with it. The authentication record would only contain\n\ninformation about the identity about the RE. It will give\n\ninformation only about the RE (nic.in) and not about the\n\norganisation which is requiring authentication through the RE. In\n\nmost cases the authentication is one time. Mr. Dwivedi has also\n\nexplained that yet again, there may be organisations, which have\n\nbranches in different part of India. Assuming Apollo Hospital\n\n(although in fact it is not an RE) has five branches in India. If\n\nApollo Hospital seeks authentication as an RE, the authentication\n\nrecord will merely tell the identity of Apollo Hospital and its device\n\ncode, but it will not indicate which branch of Apollo was seeking\n\nauthentication and from which part of the country. Further,\n\nassuming that the Indira Gandhi International Airport is an RE\n\nand there is requirement of authentication at the point of entry\n\nand/or exit. All that the record will show that the ANH has entered\n\nthe airport at a particular time but it will not show by which plane\n\nhe is flying and to what destination. At the time of exit, it will only\n\nshow that the person has exited the airport at a particular time. It\n\nwill not show from which flight he has arrived and from which\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 276 of 567\n\ndestination and at what time he has arrived or with whom he\n\ntravelled.\n\n198) However, other apprehension of the petitioners is that storing of\n\ndata for a period of seven years as per Regulations 20 and 26/27\n\nof the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, 2016 is too long a\n\nperiod. We may reproduce Regulations 26 and 27 of the Aadhaar\n\n(Authentication) Regulations, 2016 hereunder:\n\n“26. Storage and Maintenance of Authentication\nTransaction Data – (1) The Authority shall store and\nmaintain authentication transaction data, which shall\ncontain the following information:-\n\n(a) authentication request data received including PID\nblock;\n\n(b) authentication response data sent;\n\n(c) meta data related to the transaction;\n\n(d) any authentication server side configurations as\nnecessary:\n\nProvided that the Authority shall not, in any case, store the\npurpose of authentication.\n\n27. Duration of storage – (1) Authentication transaction\ndata shall be retained by the Authority for a period of 6\nmonths, and thereafter archived for a period of five years.\n\n(2) Upon expiry of the period of five years specified in sub-\nregulation (1), the authentication transaction data shall be\ndeleted except when such authentication transaction data\nare required to be maintained by a court or in connection\nwith any pending dispute.”\n\n199) It is also submitted that\nSection 10\nwhich authorises the Authority\n\nto engage one or more entities, which may be private entities, to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 277 of 567\n\nestablish and maintain CIDR is a serious threat to privacy and it\n\neven amounts to compromise on national sovereignty and\n\nsecurity. Insofar as first argument is concerned, there appears to\n\nbe some force in that. If authentication is the only purpose, we\n\nfail to understand why this authentication record is needed to be\n\nkept for a period of 2+5 years. No satisfactory explanation in this\n\nbehalf was given.\n\n200) Insofar as information regarding metadata is concerned, we may\n\nnote that the respondents distinguished between three types of\n\nmeta-data :technical, business and process metadata. Process\n\nmetadata describes the results of various operations such as logs\n\nkey data, start time, end time, CPU seconds used, disk reads,\n\ndisk writes, and rows processed. This data is valuable for\n\npurposes of authenticating transaction, troubleshooting , security,\n\ncompliance and monitoring and improving performance. They\n\nsubmit that the metadata contemplated under this Regulation is\n\nProcess metadata.\n\n201) However, metadata is not defined in the Aadhaar Act. In common\n\nparlance, it is understood as information about data, example\n\nwhereof was given by Mr. Sibal that the text of a message\n\nexchanged between two persons would be the data itself.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 278 of 567\n\nHowever, surrounding circumstances like when the message was\n\nsent; from whom and to whom the message was sent; and\n\nlocation from which the message was sent would include meta\n\ndata. As noted above, Mr. Dwivedi had tried to explain it away by\n\nstating that there are three types of meta data, namely, technical,\n\nbusiness and process meta data. According to him, meta data\n\nunder the Aadhaar Act refers to only process meta data. In\n\nsupport, he had referred to Section 2(d) of the Aadhaar Act which\n\ndefines ‘authentication record’ to mean the record of the time of\n\nauthentication, identity of requesting entity and the response\n\nprovided by the Authority. He, thus, submitted that\nRegulation 26\n\nwould not go beyond\nSection 2(d)\n. However, aforesaid\n\nexplanation that meta data refers to process data only does not\n\nfind specific mention. There is, thus, need to amend\nRegulation\nto restrict it to process meta data, and to exclude other type of\n\nmeta data specifically.\n\nPurpose Limitation:\n\n202) As per the petitioners, there is no purpose limitation. Identity\n\ninformation collected for one purpose under the Act can be\n\nused for any other (new) purpose. Definition of “benefit”\n\n(\nSection 2(f)\n) and “service” (\nSection 2(w)\n) and “subsidy” (Section\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 279 of 567\n\n2(x)), to which the personal data collected is supposed to be\n\napplied is not identifiable. It is open to the executive to notify that\n\nany advantage, gift, reward, relief, payment, provision, facility,\n\nutility or any other assistance aid, support, grant subvention, or\n\nappropriation may be made conditional on Aadhaar\n\nAuthentication. Moreover, under\nSection 57\n, the State, a body\n\ncorporate or any person can avail authentication facility and\n\naccess information under CIDR. This creates an open ended and\n\nunspecified set of laws and contracts for which Aadhaar can be\n\nused and defeats the principle of informed consent at the time of\n\nenrolment and purpose limitation.\n\n203) Respondents controvert the aforesaid submission by arguing that\n\nthere is purpose limitation under the Aadhaar Act as purpose of\n\nuse of biometric data in the CIDR is limited to authentication for\n\nidentification. The Aadhaar holder is made aware of such use of\n\nthe Aadhaar card at the time of enrolment. The enrolling agency\n\nis obliged under the Enrolment Regulations to inform the\n\nindividual about the manner in which the information shall be\n\nused, the nature of recipients with whom the information is to be\n\nshared during authentication; and the existence of a right to\n\naccess information, the procedure for making request for such\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 280 of 567\n\naccess and details of the person/ department to whom request\n\ncan be made. This information to individual is the basis for his\n\nconsent for enrolment.\n\n204) As per the respondents,\nSection 57\nis not an enabling provision\n\nwhich allows Aadhaar to be used for purposes other than\nSection\n, but is a limiting provision. It limits its use by State, Body\n\nCorporate or a person by requiring it to be sanctioned by any law\n\nin force or any contract and making the use subject to the proviso\n\nto\nSection 57\n. The proviso requires the use of Aadhaar under this\n\nSection to be subject to procedure and obligations under\nSection\nand Chapter VI of penalties.\nSection 8(2)(a)\nrequires\n\nRequesting Entities (RE) (parties authorized to carry out\n\nauthentication under\nSection 57\n) to obtain the consent of an\n\nindividual before collecting her identity information for the\n\npurposes of authentication in such manner as may be specified\n\nby regulations.\nSection 8(3)\nenables this consent to be informed\n\nconsent by requiring that an individual submitting her identity\n\ninformation for authentication shall be informed of the nature and\n\nthe use of the information that may be shared upon\n\nauthentication and the alternatives to submission of identity\n\ninformation to the requesting entity. This aspect is discussed in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 281 of 567\n\ndetail at a later stage, as it touches upon privacy aspects as well.\n\nSuffice it is to mention here that we have found some portion of\n\nSection 57\nas offending and declared that unconstitutional.\n\nInsofar as\nSections 2(f)\n, (w) and (x) are concerned, these\n\nprovisions are discussed at a later stage 77. We would like to\n\nmention here that we have read down these provisions. The\n\naforesaid measure would subserve the purpose limitation as well.\n\nTime Period for Data Retention:\n\n205) We have touched upon this aspect hereinabove. According to\n\npetitioners, the data is allowed to be retained for an\n\nunreasonable long period of time.\nRegulation 27\nof the\n\nAuthentication Regulations requires the UIDAI to retain the\n\n“authentication transaction data” (which includes the meta data)\n\nfor a period of 6 months and to archive the same for a period of 5\n\nyears thereafter.\nRegulation 18(3)\nand\n20(3)\nallow Requesting\n\nentities (RE) and Authentication Service Agencies to retain the\n\nauthentication logs for a period of 2 years and then archive them\n\nfor 5 years. It is required to be deleted only after 7 years unless\n\nretained by a court. The right of the citizen to erasure of data or\n\nright to be forgotten is severely affected by such regulation. There\n\nis no provision to delete the biometric information in any\n\n77 See paragraphs 320 to 322\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 282 of 567\n\neventuality once a person is enrolled.\n\nWe do not find any reason for archiving the authentication\n\ntransaction data for a period of five years. Retention of this data\n\nfor a period of six months is more than sufficient after which it\n\nneeds to be deleted except when such authentication transaction\n\ndata are required to be maintained by a Court or in connection\n\nwith any pending dispute. Regulations 26 and 27 shall, therefore,\n\nbe amended accordingly.\n\nData Protection and Security:\n\n206) Petitioners argued that there are not enough safeguards for data\n\nprotection and security in the Act.\nSection 28\nof the Act which\n\naddresses security and confidentiality of information is vague and\n\nfails to lay down any standard of data security or prescribe any\n\ncogent measures which are to be taken to prevent data breaches.\n\nSection 54\nempowers UIDAI to make regulations related to\n\nvarious data management processes, security protocol and other\n\ntechnology safeguards. The Aadhaar (Data Security)\n\nRegulations, 2016 passed by UIDAI under\nSection 54\n, vest in the\n\nauthority a discretion to specify “an information security policy”\n\n(\nRegulation 3\n). This leads to excessive delegation. Alternatively, it\n\nhas not been subject to parliamentary oversight which\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 283 of 567\n\nRegulations under\nSection 54\nrequire. Further, the CIDR central\n\ndatabase, unlike the ASAs and REs (under Authentication\n\nRegulation 22(1)\n), are not required to be located in data centres.\n\nThe personal data is accessible by private entities such as AUAs\n\nand KUAs and other private entities such as banks, insurance\n\ncompanies and telecom service providers. There have been\n\nnumerous data breaches in the Aadhaar system. These establish\n\nits vulnerability. There are not enough safeguards from data hack\n\nand data leak. The data is being used by private parties to build\n\ncomprehensive databases containing information and profiles of\n\nindividuals. Thus the project also lacks transparency of data and\n\nits use.\n\n207) The Respondents contend that strong measures for data\n\nprotection and security, taken at all stages of data collection,\n\ntransfer, storage and use.\n\nAfter deliberating over respective contentions, we are of the\n\nopinion that the following explanation furnished by the\n\nrespondents on various facets ensures data protection and\n\nsecurity to a considerable extent:\n\n(a) CIDR\n\n208)\nRegulation 3(i)\n& (j) of Aadhaar (Data Security) Regulation 2016\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 284 of 567\n\nenables partitioning of CIDR network into zones based on risk\n\nand trust and other security measures. CIDR being a computer\n\nresource is notified to be a “Protected System” under\nSection 70\n\nof the IT Act, 2000 by the Central Government on 11.12.2015.\n\nAnyone trying to unlawfully gain access into this system is liable\n\nto be punished with 10 years imprisonment and fine. The storage\n\ninvolves end to end encryption, logical partitioning, firewalling and\n\nanonymisation of decrypted biometric data. Breaches of penalty\n\nare made punitive by\nChapter VII of the Act\n. Biometric information\n\nis deemed to be an “electronic record”, and “Sensitive personal\n\ndata or information” under the\nIT Act, 2000\n. There are further\n\nguards under The Aadhaar ( Data Security )Regulation, 2016.\n\n(b) Requesting Entities (AUA and KUA)\n\n209) Other identity information is shared with Requesting Entity (AUAs\n\nand KUAs) only for the limited purpose of authentication. The\n\ndata is transferred from the RE to the ASA (Authentication\n\nService Agency) to the CIDR in an encrypted manner through a\n\nleased line circuitry using secure Protocols (\nRegulation 9\nof the\n\nAuthentication Regulations). The storage of data templates is in\n\nsafely located servers with no public internet inlet/outlet, and\n\noffline storage of original encrypted data (PID blocks). There are\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 285 of 567\n\nsafety and security provisions such as audit by Information\n\nSystems Auditor. REs are appointed through agreement. REs can\n\nenter into agreement with sub-AUA or sub-KUA with permission\n\nof the of UIDAI. Whatever identity information is obtained by the\n\nrequesting entity is based on a specific consent of the Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder. The e-KYC data shared with the RE can only be\n\nafter prior consent of the Aadhaar holder. Such data cannot be\n\nshared and has to be stored in encrypted form. The biometric\n\ninformation used is not permitted to be stored only the logs of\n\nauthentication transactions are maintained for a short period. Full\n\nidentity information is never transmitted back to RE. There is a\n\nstatutory bar from sharing Biometric information [\nSection 29(1)(a)\n/\n\nSection 29(4)\n]. The Data centres of ASA, REs and CIDR should\n\nbe within the territory of India.\n\n(c) Enrolment Agencies and Registrars\n\n210) The enrolment and Authentication processes are strongly\n\nregulated so that data is secure. The Enrolment agency, which\n\ncollects the biometric and demographic of the individuals during\n\nenrolment, is appointed either by UIDAI or by a Registrar [\nSection\n\n2(s)\n]. The registrar are appointed through MoUs or agreements\n\nfor enrolment and are to abide by a code of conduct and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 286 of 567\n\nprocesses, policies and guidelines issued by the authority. They\n\nare responsible for the process of enrolment. Categories of\n\npersons eligible for appointment are limited by the Regulations.\n\nThe agency employees a certified supervisor, an operator and a\n\nverifier under Enrolment and Update Regulations. Registrars,\n\nenrolling agencies are obliged to use the software provided or\n\nauthorized by UIDAI for enrolment purpose. The standard\n\nsoftware has security features as specified by Authority. All\n\nequipment used are as per the specification issued by the\n\nauthority. The Registrars are prohibited from using the\n\ninformation collected for any purpose other than uploading the\n\ninformation to CIDR. Sub-contracting of enrolment function is not\n\nallowed. The Code of Conduct contains specific directions for\n\nfollowing the confidentiality, privacy and security protocols and\n\nsubmission of periodic reports of enrolment. Not only there are\n\ndirections prohibiting manipulation and fraudulent practices but\n\nthe Act contains penal provisions for such violations in Chapter\n\nVII of the Regulations. The enrolment agencies are empanelled\n\nby the authority. They are given an enrolling agency code using\n\nwhich the Registrar can onboard such agency to the CIDR. The\n\nenrolment data is uploaded to the Central Identities Data\n\nRepository (CIDR) certified equipment and software with a digital\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 287 of 567\n\nsignature of the registrar/enrolling agency. The data is encrypted\n\nimmediately upon capture. The decryption key is with the UIDAI\n\nsolely.\nSection 2(ze)\nof the IT Act, which defines ‘secure systems’\n\nand\nSection 2(w)\nof the Act, which defines ‘intermediaries’ apply\n\nto the process.\n\n(d) Authentication Service Agency\n\n211) Authentication only becomes available through the Authentication\n\nService Agency (ASA). They are regulated by the Aadhaar\n\n(Authentication) Regulations, 2016. Their role and responsibilities\n\nare provided by Authentication\nRegulation 19\n. They are to use\n\ncertified devices, equipment, or software are duly registered with\n\nor approved or certified by the Authority/agency. The systems and\n\noperations are audited by information system auditor. The REs\n\npass the encrypted data to the CIDR through the ASA and the\n\nresponse (Yes/No authentication or e-KYC information) also\n\ntakes the same route back. The server of the ASA has to perform\n\nbasic compliance and completeness checks on the authentication\n\ndata packet before forwarding it to the CIDR.\n\n(e) Hacking\n\n212) As far as hacking is concerned, the respondents submit that the\n\nauthority has involved adequate firewalling and other safety\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 288 of 567\n\nfeatures. The biometric data stored in the CIDR is stored offline.\n\nOnly templates are online. So far there has been no incidence of\n\nhacking. However, the authority is conscious of the hackers and it\n\nconstantly updates itself to safe guard the data.\n\nIt may, however, be mentioned that of late certain reports\n\nhave appeared in newspapers to the effect that some people\n\ncould hack the website of CIDR, though it is emphatically denied\n\nby the UIDAI. Since there are only newspapers reports to this\n\neffect which appeared after the conclusion of hearing in these\n\ncases and, therefore, parties could not be heard on this aspect,\n\nwe leave this aspect of the matter at that with a hope that CIDR\n\nwould find out the ways and means to curb any such tendency.\n\n(f) Biometric Solution Providers\n\n213) With respect to foreign companies owning software, Respondents\n\nsubmit that UIDAI has entered into licensing agreements with\n\nforeign biometric solution providers (BSP) for software. Even\n\nthought the source code of the software are retained by the BSP\n\nas it constitutes their Intellectual property, the data in the server\n\nrooms is secure as the software operates automatically and the\n\nbiometric data is stored offline. There is no opportunity available\n\nto BSP to extract data as they have no access to it.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 289 of 567\n\nSubstantive, Procedural or Judicial Safeguards:\n\n214) Another grievance of the petitioners is that the Act lacks any\n\nsubstantive, procedural or judicial safeguards against misuse of\n\nindividual data.\nSection 23(2)(k)\nwhich allows sharing information\n\nof Aadhaar holders, in such manner as may be specified by\n\nregulations. This means individual’s identity information can be\n\nshared with the government. This may include demographic and\n\ncore biometric information, include aspects such as DNA profiles,\n\nhandwriting, voice-print etc., (in the future). Subsequent linkage\n\nwith various state and non-state actors that interact with such\n\nindividual may enable UIDAI to share greater information. The\n\npolice can easily gain access to all biometric information, bank\n\naccounts of the individual, all mobile phones, and meta data\n\nassociated with any associated linkages, information relating to\n\nall mutual funds, policies etc., information relating to travel by air\n\nor by rail by such person and so on.\n\n215) In other cases of collection of information of this kind under other\n\nlaws, there are exhaustive legal procedures. For example,\n\nSection 73\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which allows the\n\ntaking of handwriting samples only if necessary “for the purposes\n\nof any (specific ) investigation”, or in order to compare writing or\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 290 of 567\n\nsignature that appears in relation to the facts of a particular case.\n\nSection 53\nof the CrPC allows medical examination of a person\n\narrested on a charge of committing an offence if reasonable\n\ngrounds exist for believing that an examination of his person will\n\nafford evidence as to the commission of the offence. Similarly\n\nprovisions in various other statutes such as of the\nForeign\n\nExchange Regulation Act, 1973\n(Sections 34-48); the\nPrevention\n\nof Money-Laundering Act, 2002\n(Sections 17-19); the\nNarcotic\n\nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985\n(Sections 41-42)\n\nand the\nCustoms Act, 1962\n(Chapter 13) which allow for search,\n\nseizure or even arrest, and thereby provide access to personal\n\ninformation also bear a nexus with a particular crime under\n\ninvestigation.\n\n216) As per the petitioners, the Investigating Agency can presently\n\naccess fingerprints, only limited to cases of citizens who were\n\narrested on the reasonable basis of having committed a crime, or\n\nwere convicted of a crime, as per provisions of the\nIdentification\n\nof Prisoners Act\n. In all such circumstances, not only are there\n\nadequate safeguards- such as permission from the Magistrate\n\nthat collection is necessary for the purpose of investigation, but\n\npersons accused of an offence presently can claim protection\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 291 of 567\n\nunder\nArticle 20(3)\n, thereby making it incumbent upon the\n\ninvestigating agency to obtain such information in accordance\n\nwith law, as described above. Further, unlike the Aadhaar Act,\n\npresent day criminal statutes contain provisions for destruction of\n\nsome kinds of core biometric data obtained [\nSection 7\nof the\n\nIdentification of Prisoners Act, 1920]. No such safeguards exist\n\nunder the Aadhaar Act.\n\n217) It is also argued that\nSection 33(2)\n, which permits disclosure of\n\nidentity information and authentication records under direction of\n\nan officer not below the rank of Jt. Secretary to Central\n\nGovernment in the interest of national security, has no provision\n\nfor judicial review. The Oversight Committee does not have a\n\njudicial member.\n\n218) Respondents submitted that Section 29 of the Aadhaar Act\n\nprovides protection against disclosure of core biometric\n\ninformation. The biometric information cannot shared with anyone\n\nfor any reason whatsoever; or used for any purpose other than\n\ngeneration of Aadhaar numbers and authentication under this Act.\n\nSection 8\nensure that the during authentication, biometric\n\ninformation of an individual is only used for submission to the\n\nCentral Identities Data Repository.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 292 of 567\n\n219) We are of the view that most of the apprehensions of the\n\npetitioners stand assuaged with the treatment which is given by\n\nus to some of the provisions. Some of these are already\n\ndiscussed above and some provisions are debated in the next\n\nissue. Summary thereof, however, can be given hereunder:\n\n(a) Authentication records are not to be kept beyond a period\n\nof six months, as stipulated in\nRegulation 27(1)\nof the\n\nAuthentication Regulations. This provision which permits\n\nrecords to be archived for a period of five years is held to\n\nbe bad in law.\n\n(b) Metabase relating to transaction, as provided in\nRegulation\nof the aforesaid Regulations in the present form, is held\n\nto be impermissible, which needs suitable amendment.\n\n(c) Section 33 of the Aadhaar Act is read down by clarifying\n\nthat an individual, whose information is sought to be\n\nreleased, shall be afforded an opportunity of hearing.\n\n(d) Insofar as\nSection 33(2)\nof the Act in the present form is\n\nconcerned, the same is struck down.\n\n(e) That portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act which\n\nenables body corporate and individual to seek\n\nauthentication is held to be unconstitutional.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 293 of 567\n\n(f) We have also impressed upon the respondents, as the\n\ndiscussion hereinafter would reveal, to bring out a robust\n\ndata protection regime in the form of an enactment on the\n\nbasis of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (Retd.) Committee Report\n\nwith necessary modifications thereto as may be deemed\n\nappropriate.\n\n220) With the removal of the aforesaid provisions from the statute and\n\nthe Rules, coupled with the statement of the Authority on affidavit\n\nthat there is no record of any transactions carried out by the\n\nindividuals which is even known (and, therefore, no question of\n\nthe same being retained by the Authority), most of the\n\napprehensions of the petitioners are taken care of. At the same\n\ntime, we may remind ourselves of the judgment in\nG.\n\nSundarrajan v. Union of India & Ors.78\n. In that case, the Court\n\nnoted the safety and security risk in the setting up of the nuclear\n\npower plant in the backdrop of Fukushima disaster and Bhopal\n\nGas tragedy. Yet, keeping in view the importance of generation\n\nof nuclear energy, the Court observed that a balance should be\n\nstruck between production of nuclear energy which was of\n\nextreme importance for the economic growth, alleviation of\n\npoverty, generation of employment, and the smaller violation to\n\n78 (2013) 6 SCC 620\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 294 of 567\n\nright to life under\nArticle 21.\nIt took note of the opinion of experts\n\ncommittee and observed that ‘adequate safety measure’ have\n\nbeen taken. It noted huge expenditure of money running into\n\ncrores and observed ‘apprehension however legitimate it may be,\n\ncannot override the justification of the project. Nobody on this\n\nearth can predict what would happen in future and to a larger\n\nextent we have to leave it to the destiny. But once the justification\n\ntest is satisfied, the apprehension test is bound to fail.\n\nApprehension is something we anticipate with anxiety or fear, a\n\nfearful anticipation, which may vary from person to person’. The\n\nCourt also held that ‘nuclear power plant is being established not\n\nto negate right to life but to protect the right to life guaranteed\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. No doubt, the Court took a\n\nview that this interest of people needed to be respected for their\n\nhuman dignity which was divinity. However, it was also stressed\n\nthat generation of nuclear energy was a nuclear necessity and\n\nthe project was for larger public benefit and consequently,\n\nindividual interest or smaller public interest must yield. In such a\n\nsituation, necessity for ‘adequate care, caution, and monitoring at\n\nevery stage’ and ‘constant vigil’ was emphasised. Safety and\n\nsecurity was read into\nArticle 21.\nAcknowledging that\n\nproportionality of risk may not be ‘zero’, regard being had to the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 295 of 567\n\nnature’s unpredictability, the Court ruled that all efforts must be\n\nmade to avoid disaster by observing the highest degree of\n\nconstant alertness. In the directions of the Court, it was observed\n\nthat ‘maintaining safety is an ongoing process not only at the\n\ndesign level but also during the operation’. In the present case\n\nas well, we have come to the conclusion that Aadhaar Act is a\n\nbeneficial legislation which is aimed at empowering millions of\n\npeople in this country. The justification of this project has been\n\ntaken note of in detail, which the subsequent discussion shall\n\nalso demonstrate. In such a scenario only on apprehension, the\n\nproject cannot be shelved. At the same time, data protection and\n\ndata safety is also to be ensured to avoid even the remote\n\npossibility of data profiling or data leakage.\n\n221) Notwithstanding the statutory provision discussed above, we are\n\nof the view that there is a need for a proper legislative\n\nmechanism for data protection. The Government is not unmindful\n\nof this essential requirement. During the arguments it was stated\n\nby Mr. K.K. Venugopal, learned Attorney General, that an expert\n\ncommittee heading by Justice B.N. Srikrishna (Retd.) was\n\nconstituted which was looking into the matter. The said\n\nCommittee has since given its report.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 296 of 567\n\n222) In this behalf, it may be worthwhile to mention that one of the first\n\ncomprehensive reports on data protection and informational\n\nprivacy was prepared by the Group of Experts 79 constituted by\n\nthe Planning Commission of India under the Chairmanship of\n\nRetd. Justice A.P. Shah, which submitted a report on 16 October,\n\n2012. The five salient features of this report were expected to\n\nserve as a conceptual foundation for legislation protecting\n\nprivacy. The framework suggested by the expert group was\n\nbased on five salient features: (i) Technological neutrality and\n\ninteroperability with international standards; (ii) Multi-Dimensional\n\nprivacy; (iii) Horizontal applicability to state and non-state entities;\n\n(iv) Conformity with privacy principles; and (v) A co-regulatory\n\nenforcement regime.\n\n223) The Union Government, on 31 July 2017, had constituted a\n\ncommittee chaired by Retd.Justice B N Srikrishna, former Judge\n\nof the Supreme Court of India to review data protection norms in\n\nthe country and to make recommendations. The Committee\n\nrecently released its report and the first draft of the Personal Data\n\nProtection Bill, 2018 which comprehensively addresses the\n\nprocessing of personal data where such data has been collected,\n\n79 “Report of the Group of Experts on Privacy” (16 October, 2012), Government of India, available\nat http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_privacy.pdf\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 297 of 567\n\ndisclosed, shared or otherwise processed within the territory of\n\nIndia. The bill has incorporated provisions and principles from the\n\nEurope’s General Data Protection Regulation (EUGDPR).\n\n224) The Draft Bill replaces the traditional concepts of data controller\n\ni.e. the entity which processes data and data subject i.e. the\n\nnatural person whose data is being collected, with data ‘fiduciary’\n\nand data ‘principal’. It aims to create a trust-based relationship\n\nbetween the two.\n\n225) The Bill largely incorporates data protection principles from the\n\nEUGDPR and EU data protection jurisprudence, including fair\n\nand reasonable processing of data, purpose limitation, collection\n\nlimitation, lawful processing, storage limitation, data quality and\n\naccountability. The Draft bill and the report cull out rights and\n\nobligations of the data fiduciary and data controller respectively.\n\nThese rights include the right to access and correction, the right\n\nto data portability and right to be forgotten – a right to prevent or\n\nrestrict disclosure of personal data by a fiduciary. Most\n\nimportantly, consent has been given a crucial status in the draft\n\ndata protection law. Thus, a primary basis for processing of\n\npersonal data must be individual consent. This consent is\n\nrequired to be free, informed, specific, clear and, in an important\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 298 of 567\n\naddition, capable of being withdrawn. The Authority under the Bill\n\nis obligated and empowered to ensure protection of data from\n\nmisuse and compromise.\n\n226) Processing of biometric data, classified as ‘Sensitive Personal\n\nData’ (SPD), by the data fiduciary mandates additional\n\nsafeguards (mentioned under Chapter IV of the Bill). For\n\nexample, the data fiduciary is required to undertake Data\n\nProtection Impact Assessment under the provisions of the Bill.\n\nThe Draft Bill allows processing of biometric data for the exercise\n\nof any function of the State authorised by law for the provision of\n\nany service or benefit to the data principal. Special provisions to\n\nprotect sensitive and personal data of children also exist. For\n\nexample, Data fiduciaries shall be barred from profiling, tracking,\n\nor behavioural monitoring of, or targeted advertising directed at,\n\nchildren and undertaking any other processing of personal data\n\nthat can cause significant harm to the child.\n\n227) For security of data and protection of breach, the Draft Bill has\n\nseparate provisions which require use of methods such as de-\n\nidentification and encryption and other steps necessary to protect\n\nthe integrity of personal data and to prevent misuse, unauthorised\n\naccess to, modification, disclosure or destruction of personal\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 299 of 567\n\ndata. The data fiduciary is required to immediately notify the\n\nAuthority of any personal data breach relating to any personal\n\ndata processed by the data fiduciary where such breach is likely\n\nto cause harm to any data principal. It also incorporates a\n\nprovision for Grievance Redressal.\n\n228) The Draft Bill creates several exceptions and exemptions for\n\nprocessing data by the State. These are situations where rights\n\nand obligations of data principals and data fiduciaries may not\n\napply in totality. Such situations include national security,\n\nprevention of crime, allocation of resources for human\n\ndevelopment, protection of revenue, etc. The committee asserts\n\nthat such exceptions have been envisaged in the Puttaswamy\n\njudgement as legitimate interests of the state and satisfy the\n\nproportionality test.\n\n229) The Srikrishna Committee Report and the Draft Data Protection\n\nBill are the first articulation of a data protection law in our country.\n\nThey have incorporated many of the progressive data protection\n\nprinciples inspired by the EUGDPR. There may be indeed be\n\nscope for further fine tuning of this law through a consultative\n\nprocess, however, we are not far away from a comprehensive\n\ndata protection regime which entrenches informational and data\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 300 of 567\n\nprivacy within our laws and legal system. We hope that there\n\nwould be a robust statutory regime in place in near future.\n\n230) The aforesaid discussion leads us to hold that the protection that\n\nthere is going to be a surveillance state created by the Aadhaar\n\nproject is not well founded, and in any case, taken care of by the\n\ndiffluence exercise carried out with the striking down certain\n\noffending provisions in their present form.\n\nPrivacy:\n\nWhether Aadhaar Act violates right to privacy and is\nunconstitutional on this ground?\n\n(This issue is considered in the context of\nSection 7\nand\n\nSection 8\nof the Act.)\n\n231) The petitioners submit that right to privacy and dignity and\n\nindividual autonomy have been established by various cases.\nIn\n\nGobind v. State of M.P.80\n, this Court held:\n\n“the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings\nand of his intellect and that only a part of the pain,\npleasure, satisfaction of life can be found in material things\nand therefore they must be deemed to have conferred\nupon the individual as against the Government, a sphere\nwhere he should be let alone.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n24. Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the\npersonal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage,\nmotherhood, procreation and child rearing. This catalogue\napproach to the question is obviously not as instructive as\nit does not give analytical picture of the distinctive\ncharacteristics of the right of privacy. Perhaps, the only\n\n80 (1975) 2 SCC 148\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 301 of 567\n\nsuggestion that can be offered as unifying principle\nunderlying the concept has been the assertion that a\nclaimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.\n\n25. Rights and freedoms of citizens are set forth in the\nConstitution in order to guarantee that the individual, his\npersonality, and those things stamped with his personality\nshall be free from official interference except where a\nreasonable basis for intrusion exists. “Liberty against\nGovernment” a phrase coined by Professor Corwin\nexpresses this idea forcefully. In this sense, many of the\nfundamental rights of citizens can be described as\ncontributing to the right to privacy.\n\n26. As Ely says:\n\n“There is nothing to prevent one from using the word\n‘privacy’ to mean the freedom to live one's life without\ngovernmental interference. But the Court obviously does\nnot so use the term. Nor could it, for such a right is at stake\nin every case.”\n\n232) To recapitulate briefly, the judgment of K.S. Puttaswamy has\n\naffirmed the following –\n\n(i) privacy has always been a natural right, and the correct\n\nposition has been established by a number of judgments starting\n\nfrom Gobind. Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the\n\nindividual to exercise control over his or her personality. Equally,\n\nprivacy is the necessary condition precedent to the enjoyment of\n\nany of the guarantees in Part III. The fundamental right to privacy\n\nwould cover at least three aspects—(i) intrusion with an\n\nindividual’s physical body, (ii) informational privacy and (iii)\n\nprivacy of choice. Further, one aspect of privacy is the right to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 302 of 567\n\ncontrol the dissemination of personal information. Every individual\n\nshould have a right to be able to control exercise over his/her own\n\nlife and image as portrayed in the world and to control\n\ncommercial use of his/her identity.\n\n(ii) The sanctity of privacy lies in its functional relationship with\n\ndignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can lead a life of\n\ndignity by securing the inner recesses of the human personality\n\nfrom unwanted intrusions. While the legitimate expectation of\n\nprivacy may vary from intimate zone to the private zone and from\n\nthe private to the public arena, it is important to underscore that\n\nprivacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is\n\nin a public place. Privacy is a postulate of dignity itself. Privacy\n\nconcerns arise when the State seeks to intrude into the body and\n\nthe mind of the citizen.\n\n(iii) Privacy as intrinsic to freedom, liberty and dignity. The right\n\nto privacy is inherent to the liberties guaranteed by Part-III of the\n\nConstitution and privacy is an element of human dignity. The\n\nfundamental right to privacy derives from Part-III of the\n\nConstitution and recognition of this right does not require a\n\nconstitutional amendment. Privacy is more than merely a\n\nderivative constitutional right. It is the necessary basis of rights\n\nguaranteed in the text of the Constitution.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 303 of 567\n\n(iv) Privacy has both positive and negative content. The\n\nnegative content restrains the State from committing an intrusion\n\nupon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive content\n\nimposes an obligation on the State to take all necessary\n\nmeasures to protect the privacy of the individual.\n\n(v) Informational Privacy is a facet of right to privacy. The old\n\nadage that ‘knowledge is power’ has stark implications for the\n\nposition of individual where data is ubiquitous, an all-\n\nencompassing presence. Every transaction of an individual user\n\nleaves electronic tracks, without her knowledge. Individually these\n\ninformation silos may seem inconsequential. In aggregation,\n\ninformation provides a picture of the beings. The challenges\n\nwhich big data poses to privacy emanate from both State and\n\nnon-State entities.\n\n(vi) Right to privacy cannot be impinged without a just, fair and\n\nreasonable law. It has to fulfil the test of proportionality i.e. (i)\n\nexistence of a law (ii) must serve a legitimate State aim and (iii)\n\nproportionate.\n\n233) We have also remarked, in paragraph 85 above, the taxonomy of\n\nprivacy, namely, on the basis of ‘harms’, ‘interest’ and\n\n‘aggregation of rights’. We have also discussed the scope of\n\nright to privacy with reference to the cases at hand and the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 304 of 567\n\ncircumstances in which such a right can be limited. In the\n\nprocess, we have also taken note of the passage from the\n\njudgment rendered by Nariman, J. in K.S. Puttaswamy stating the\n\nmanner in which law has to be tested when it is challenged on the\n\nground that it violates the fundamental right to privacy. Keeping\n\nin mind all these considerations and parameters, we proceed to\n\ndeal with the argument on right to privacy.\n\n234) It is argued that the Aadhaar project, during the pre-Act period\n\n(2009/10 – July, 2016), violated the Right to Privacy with respect\n\nto personal demographic as well as biometric information\n\ncollected, stored and shared as there was no law authorizing\n\nthese actions. In a digital society an individual has the right to\n\nprotect herself by controlling the dissemination of such personal\n\ninformation. Compelling an individual to establish her identity by\n\nplanting her biometric at multiple points of service violates privacy\n\ninvolving the person. The seeding of Aadhaar in distinct data\n\nbases enables the content of information about an individual that\n\nis stored in different silos to be aggregated. This enables the\n\nState to build complete profiles of individuals violating privacy\n\nthrough the convergence of data.\n\n235) It is also contended that the citizen’s right to informational privacy\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 305 of 567\n\nis violated by authentication under the Aadhaar Act inasmuch as\n\nthe citizen is compelled to ‘report’ her actions to the State. Even\n\nwhere a person is availing of a subsidy, benefit or service from\n\nthe State under\nSection 7\nof the Act, mandatory authentication\n\nthrough the Aadhaar platform (without an option to the citizen to\n\nuse an alternative mode of identification) violates the right to\n\ninformational privacy. An individual’s rights and entitlements\n\ncannot be made dependent upon an invasion of his or her bodily\n\nintegrity and his or her private information which the individual\n\nmay not be willing to share with the State. The bargain underlying\n\nsection 7\nis an unconscionable, unconstitutional bargain.\nSection\nis against the constitutional morality contained in both Part III as\n\nwell the Part IV of the Constitution of India.\n\n236) It was also highlighted that today the fastest growing businesses\n\nare network orchestrators, the likes of Facebook and Uber, which\n\nrecreate a network of peers in which participants interact and\n\nshare value in creation. The most important assets for these\n\nnetwork orchestrators is information. Although, individuals share\n\ninformation with these entities, such information is scattered, not\n\nconcentrated in a single authority or aggregated. If information,\n\ncollected in different silos is aggregated and centralized, it can\n\nafford easy access to a person’s complete profile, including her\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 306 of 567\n\nsocial groups, proclivities, habits, inclinations, tastes etc. The\n\nentity that holds the key to such information would then be in an\n\nextremely powerful position, especially if such entity is the State.\n\nSince informational privacy is a part of Right to Privacy, it had to\n\nbe saved. The peittioners pointed out that the significance of\n\ninformation being aggregated was noted by Hon’ble Court in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy as follows:\n\n“300 ...Yet every transaction of an individual user and every\nsite that she visits, leaves electronic tracks generally\nwithout her knowledge. These electronic tracks contain\npowerful means of information which provide knowledge of\nthe sort of person that the user is and her interests.\nIndividually, these information silos may seem\ninconsequential. In aggregation, they disclose the nature of\nthe personality: food habits, language, health, hobbies,\nsexual preferences, friendships, ways of dress and political\naffiliation. In aggregation, information provides a picture of\nthe being: of things which matter and those that don't, of\nthings to be disclosed and those best hidden…\n\nxx xx xx\n\n305. Daniel J Solove deals with the problem of\n\"aggregation\". Businesses and governments often\naggregate a variety of information fragments, including\npieces of information which may not be viewed as private\nin isolation to create a detailed portrait of personalities and\nbehaviour of individuals. Yet, it is now a universally\naccepted fact that information and data flow are\n\"increasingly central to social and economic ordering\".\n\nIndividuals are identified with reference to tax records,\nvoting eligibility, and government-provided entitlements.\nThere is what is now described as \"'veillant panoptic\nassemblage', where data gathered through the ordinary\ncitizen's veillance practices finds its way to state\nsurveillance mechanisms, through the corporations that\nhold that data.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 307 of 567\n\n237) It was further argued that test of proportionality was not satisfied\n\nas the extent of information collected is not proportionate to the\n\n‘compelling interest of the State’. Various judgments were citied\n\nwhere the principle of proportionality has been established by this\n\ncourt.\nIn\nChairman, All India Railway Recruitment Board v. K\n\nShyam Kumar\nand others81, this Court held as follows:\n\n“37. ...Proportionality requires the court to judge whether\naction taken was really needed as well as whether it was\nwithin the range of courses of action which could\nreasonably be followed. Proportionality is more concerned\nwith the aims and intention of the decision-maker and\nwhether the decision-maker has achieved more or less the\ncorrect balance or equilibrium. The court entrusted with the\ntask of judicial review has examine whether decision taken\nby the authority is proportionate i.e. well balanced and\nharmonious, to this extent the court may indulge in a merit\nreview and if the court finds that the decision is\nproportionate, it seldom interferes with the decision taken\nand if it finds that the decision is disproportionate i.e. if the\ncourt feels that it is not well balanced or harmonious and\ndoes not stand to reason it may tend to interfere.”\n\n238) Attention was also drawn to the judgment in Modern Dental\n\nCollege & Research Centre, wherein this Court established the\n\nfour-limb test of proportionality. It was argued that Aadhaar failed\n\nto meet the test laid down therein.\n\n239) According to the petitioners, there is no compelling state interest\n\nfor State to know the details of the location and time of using\n\nAadhaar authentication. Likewise, there are various other\n\n81 (2010) 6 SCC 614\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 308 of 567\n\nmethods available for identification. Submission was that one of\n\nthe objects of the Aadhaar project is to ensure targeted delivery in\n\nthe disbursement of government subsidies benefits and services\n\nin India. Identification for this purpose can be carried out by\n\nvarious other identity documents issued by the government of\n\nIndia, such as passport, voting card, ration card, driving license,\n\njob card issued by NREGA duly signed by an officer of the State\n\ngovernment, employment certificate by a public authority, birth\n\ncertificate, school leaving certificate, PAN card, overseas Indian\n\ncitizen card/PIO/OCI of Indian origin card. There is no justification\n\nto impose Aadhaar under as the exclusive means of identification\n\nunder\nSection 7\n, without which a person would be unable to\n\nsecure her entitlements. Such mandate would not only infringe\n\nupon the privacy of a person and violate a person’s fundamental\n\nrights, but would also unreasonably deprive a person of her\n\nentitlements on a ground that has little connection with her right\n\nto receive such entitlements.\n\n240) Judgment in the case of\nJordan & Ors v. State82\nwas also cited\n\nwherein Sachs & O’Regan JJ. concurringly held that continuum\n\nof privacy rights start with the inviolable inner self, move to\n\nthe home, and end with the public realm; and that\n\n82 (2002) ZACC 22\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 309 of 567\n\ncommitment to dignity invests great value in the inviolability\n\nand worth of the body. Decisional privacy allows individuals to\n\nmake decisions about their own body, and is an aspect of\n\nright to self determination. It is underscored by personal\n\nautonomy, which prevents the State from using citizens as\n\npuppets and controlling their body and decisions.\n\nInformational privacy deals with a person’s mind and\n\ncomprises of (i) anonymity, (ii) secrecy, and (iii) freedom. It\n\nis premised on the assumption that all information about a\n\nperson is in a fundamental way her own, for her to\n\ncommunicate or retain for herself as she sees fit.\n\n241) It was submitted that privacy rights against both the State and\n\nnon-State actors. There is a qualitative difference between right\n\nto privacy against the State and against Non-state actors. Subba\n\nRao. J’s dissent in Kharak Singh, was relied upon wherein it was\n\nstated that the existence of concentrated and centralized State\n\npower, rather than its actual or potential use that creates the\n\nchilling effect and leads to psychological restraint on the ability of\n\ncitizens to think freely. Therefore, individuals have a higher\n\nexpectation of privacy from the State. In the vein, it was further\n\nsubmitted that the State was imposing disproportionate and\n\nunreasonable State compulsion. States do not have the power to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 310 of 567\n\ncompel their citizens to do particular acts, except in a\n\nnarrow range of defined circumstances.\nAs sentinels on the\n\nqui vive, Courts are duty bound to protect citizens against\n\nState compulsion, whether in the context of forcibly\n\nundergoing narco-analysis/lie detectors tests or forcibly\n\nundergoing sterilization. Compulsion can be used in limited\n\ncircumstances such as punishment for law-breaking, compulsion\n\nin the aid of law enforcement, and compulsion to prevent\n\npotential law-breaking. These include fines, imprisonment,\n\nfingerprint collection for criminals and prisoners. Even in medical\n\njurisprudence, the case of\nCommon Cause v. Union of India83\n\nelaborates on the concepts of dignity, bodily integrity and\n\ndecisional autonomy. For DNA tests and blood tests to be\n\nconducted a high standard of evidence is required.\nSimilarly\n\n‘refusal of treatment’ is a constitutionally protected liberty interest\n\nin the United States of America as stated in the case of Cruzan v.\n\nDirector, Missouri Dept. of Health84.\n\n242) The petitioners further submitted that although the Aadhaar Act\n\nis ostensibly framed as a voluntary entitlement to establish\n\none’s identity under\nsection 3\nread with Section 4(3) of the\n\nAadhaar Act, the actions of the Executive and private entities\n83 Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005\n84 497 US 361 (1990)\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 311 of 567\n\nunder\nsections 7\nand\nhave made possession of Aadhaar de\n\nfacto mandatory. Residents have thus been forced to obtain\n\nan Aadhaar number, for continued access to statutory\n\nentitlements and services. 252 government schemes have\n\nbeen notified by various Ministries/Departments of the\n\nCentral Government under\nsection 7\n(as on 30.11.2017)\n\nrequiring Aadhaar as a condition precedent for availing\n\nservices, subsidies and benefits including for persons with\n\ndisabilities, for SC/STs, and for rehabilitation of Manual\n\nScavengers. It has also been made mandatory for mobile\n\nservices, banking and tax payments, registration of students of\n\nCBSE, amongst other things. It thus pervades every aspect of an\n\nindividual’s life. Concomitantly, there is no opt out option in the\n\nAadhaar Act, which makes consent irrevocable and deprives\n\nindividuals the ability to make decisions about their life.\n\n243) As per the petitioners, this kind of mandatory nature of\nSection 7\n\nviolates\nArticle 14.\nThey submit that mandatory authentication\n\nhas caused, and continues to cause, exclusion of the most\n\nmarginalized sections of society. Proof of possession of an\n\nenrolment number or undergoing Aadhaar authentication is a\n\nmandatory pre-requisite for receiving subsidised food grain\n\nunder the\nNational Food Security Act\n. It creates “undue\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 312 of 567\n\nburden” on citizen which is unconstitutional. Successful monthly\n\nauthentication is contingent on harmonious working of all\n\nattendant Aadhaar processes and technologies–i.e. correct\n\nAadhaar-seeding, successful fingerprint recognition, mobile\n\nand wireless connectivity, electricity, functional POS\n\nmachines and server capacity–each time. It is also dependant\n\non age, disability (e.g.leprosy), class of work (e.g. manual\n\nlabour), and the inherently probabilistic nature of biometric.\n\nEconomic Survey of India 2016 reports that authentication\n\nfailures have been as high as 49% in Jharkhand and 37%\n\nin Rajasthan, recognising that “failure to identify genuine\n\nbeneficiaries results in exclusion error”.\n\n244) The exclusion is not simply a question of poor\n\nimplementation that can be administratively resolved, but\n\nstems from the very design of the Act, i.e. the use of\n\nbiometric authentication as the primary method of\n\nidentification. Determination of legal entitlements is contingent\n\non a positive authentication response from the UIDAI.\n\nBiometric technology does not guarantee 100% accuracy and\n\nis fallible, with inevitable false positives and false negatives\n\nthat are design flaws of such a probabilistic system,\n\nespecially because biometrics also change over time.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 313 of 567\n\n245) Classification caused by the Act lacks rational nexus. The\n\nentitlement of an individual depends upon status, and not\n\nproof of identity. At the point of use, The Biometric\n\nAuthentication divides residents into two classes: those who\n\nhave and do not have Aadhaar; and those who authenticate\n\nsuccessfully, and those who do not. Given that the\n\nprobability of biometric mismatch is greatest for the aged,\n\ndisabled, and individuals engaging in manual labour –\n\namongst the most vulnerable sections of society–the\n\ndecision to use periodic biometric authentications has a\n\ndirect and disparate effect of violating fundamental rights of\n\nthis class. This division bears no rational nexus with the\n\nquestion of status for receiving benefits. It leads to under-\n\ninclusion, and is thus arbitrary, causing an\nArticle 14\n\nviolation.\n\n246) It is also argued that mandatory nature of\nSection 7\nviolates\n\nArticle 21\nas well. The Aadhaar Act alters the entire design &\n\ninstitutional structure through which residents were receiving\n\nentitlements. Mandatory imposition of Aadhaar violates their\n\nrights to choose how to identify themselves to the\n\ngovernment in a reasonable and non-intrusive fashion. On\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 314 of 567\n\nmaking Aadhaar mandatory, instead of the citizen’s right to\n\nfood and a correlative duty on the State to take action to\n\nensure the proper fulfilment of such rights, the State is\n\nexercising its power to convert the constitutional rights of its\n\ncitizens into liabilities.\n\n247) As per the petitioners, having established the infringement of\n\nArticle 21\n, the invasion is not justified under the principle of\n\nproportionality. The State’s primary justification of eliminating\n\nwelfare leakages and ensuring “better targeting” does not\n\nstand up to judicial scrutiny.\n\nFirst, it has failed to discharge its burden of showing\n\nthat the purported leakages were exclusively caused due to\n\nidentity fraud, and that those leakages would not exist if\n\nAadhaar is implemented. The state has not given any empirical\n\ndata. Leakages exist due to eligibility frauds, quantity frauds and\n\nidentity frauds. Studies filed in Petitioner’s affidavits show that\n\neligibility and quantity frauds are the substantial cause for\n\nleakages. Assuming that the Aadhaar Act prevents leakages, the\n\nbiometric identification system can, at best, only cure leakages\n\nrelated to identity fraud. The government’s claims of savings\n\ninter alia of Rs. 14,000 crores in the PDS system, due to the\n\ndeletion of 2.33 crore ration cards is incorrect, inflated, and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 315 of 567\n\nbased on wrong assumptions for the following reasons:\n\n(a) it admittedly does not have estimates of leakages in\n\nPDS, nor has any study been done to see if POS machines\n\nare effective in removing PDS irregularities;\n\n(b) it conflates issue of “bogus /ineligible ration cards”\n\n(eligibility fraud) with identity fraud;\n\n(c) the figure of 2.33 crore includes West Bengal, where\n\nration cards are issued to each person, as opposed to each\n\nhousehold;\n\n(d) a large number of these 2.33 crore cards were deleted\n\neven before Aadhaar-integration and seeding came into\n\neffect;\n\n(e) the savings figure includes even those eligible\n\nbeneficiaries who have been removed from the list due to\n\nfailure to link Aadhaar properly; and\n\n(f) it does not value the cost of loss of privacy. Most\n\nimportantly, the basis for reaching such savings figure has\n\nnot been disclosed.\n\nSimilarly, incorrect averments have been made in the\n\ncontext of LPG savings, using Aadhaar-enabled Direct Benefit\n\nTransfer (‘DBT’) scheme known as PAHAL.\n\nSecondly, it has failed to show how the introduction of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 316 of 567\n\nAadhaar will stop the losses causes on any of the grounds\n\nabove. Aadhaar is susceptible to its own unique forms of mischief\n\nby the vendor.\n\nThirdly, the State has failed to demonstrate that other,\n\nless invasive ways would be significantly worse at addressing\n\nthe problem, especially given recent studies that found a\n\nsignificant reduction in PDS leakages, due to innovations\n\ndevised to work within the PDS system; alternatives such as\n\nfood coupons, digitisation of records, doorstep delivery, SMS\n\nalerts, social audits, and toll-free helplines have not been\n\nlooked at.\n\nFourthly, the absence of proportionality is further\n\nestablished by the fact of systematic exclusion.\n\n248) The respondents refuted, in strongest possible manner, all the\n\naforesaid submissions in the following manner:\n\n(i) No reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nAt the outset it was argued that Right to Privacy exists when\n\nthere is a reasonable expectation of privacy. K.S. Puttaswamy\n\njudgment, US case law, UK case laws and the European cases\n\non\nArticle 8\nof ECHR were referred to to determine the contours\n\nof reasonable expectation of privacy. Submission was that the Act\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 317 of 567\n\noperates in the public and relational sphere and not in the core,\n\nprivate or personal sphere of residents. It involves minimal\n\nidentity information for effective authentication. The purpose is\n\nlimited to authentication for identification.\nSection 29\nof the\n\nAadhaar Act, 2016 provides protection against disclosure of\n\nidentity information without the prior consent of the ANH\n\nconcerned. Sharing is intended only for authentication purposes.\n\nIt was also submitted that there is no reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy with respect to identity information collected under the\n\nAadhaar Act for the purposes of authentication and therefore\n\nArticle 21\nis not attracted.\n\n249) The respondents point out that four types of information collected\n\nfor providing Aadhaar (i). Mandatory demographic information\n\ncomprising name, date of birth, address and gender [\nSection 2(k)\n\nread with\nRegulation 4(1)\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\nRegulations, 2016]; (ii) Optional demographic information\n\n[\nSection 2(k)\nread with\nRegulation 4(2)\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment\n\nand Update) Regulations, 2016]. (iii) Non-core biometric\n\ninformation comprising photograph. (iv) Core biometric\n\ninformation comprising finger print and iris scan.\n\n250) Demographic information, both mandatory and optional, and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 318 of 567\n\nphotographs does not raise a reasonable expectation of privacy\n\nunder\nArticle 21\nunless under special circumstances such as\n\njuveniles in conflict of law or a rape victim’s identity. Today, all\n\nglobal ID cards contain photographs for identification alongwith\n\naddress, date of birth, gender etc. The demographic information\n\nis readily provided by individuals globally for disclosing identity\n\nwhile relating with others and while seeking benefits whether\n\nprovided by government or by private entities, be it registration for\n\ncitizenship, elections, passports, marriage or enrolment in\n\neducational institutions. Email ids and phone numbers are also\n\navailable in public domain, For example in telephone directories.\n\nAadhaar Act only uses demographic information which are not\n\nsensitive and where no reasonable expectation of privacy exists -\n\nname, date of birth, address, gender, mobile number and e mail\n\naddress.\nSection 2(k)\nspecifically provides that Regulations\n\ncannot include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language,\n\nrecords of entitlement, income or medical history. Thus, sensitive\n\ninformation specifically stand excluded.\n\n251) Face Photographs for the purpose of identification are not\n\ncovered by a reasonable expectation of privacy. Barring\n\nunpublished intimate photographs and photographs pertaining to\n\nconfidential situations there will be no zone of privacy with\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 319 of 567\n\nrespect to normal facial photographs meant for identification.\n\nFace-photographs are given by people for driving license,\n\npassport, voter id, school admissions, examination admit cards,\n\nemployment cards, enrolment in professions and even for entry in\n\ncourts. In our daily lives we recognize each other by face which\n\nstands exposed to all, all the time. The face photograph by itself\n\nreveals no information.\n\n252) There is no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to\n\nfingerprint and iris scan as they are not dealing with the intimate\n\nor private sphere of the individual but are used solely for\n\nauthentication. Iris scan is nothing but a photograph of the eye,\n\ntaken in the same manner as a face photograph. Fingerprints and\n\niris scans are not capable of revealing any personal information\n\nabout the individual except for serving the purpose of\n\nidentification. Fingerprints are largely used in biometric\n\nattendance, laptops and mobiles. Even when a privacy right\n\nexists on a fingerprint, it will be weak. Finger print and iris scan\n\nhave been considered to be the most accurate and non-invasive\n\nmode of identifying an individual. They are taken for passports,\n\nvisa and registration by the State and also used in mobile\n\nphones, laptops, lockers etc for private use. Biometrics are being\n\nused for unique identification in e passports by 120 countries.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 320 of 567\n\n(ii) Least intrusive and strict scrutiny tests do not apply in the\n\nproportionality test.\n\nLearned Attorney General argued that the “least intrusive\n\ntest” is not applicable while asserting the test of proportionality.\n\nHe relied on various U.S. Supreme Court judgments which\n\nexplicitly rejected the test and the case of Modern Dental College\n\n& Research Centre which does not use the least intrusive\n\nmeasure test while undertaking the proportionality test.\n\nMr.Dwivedi contends that the least intrusive means of\n\nachieving the state object, while carrying out the proportionality\n\ntest, has been rejected by Indian courts in a catena of decisions\n\nas it involves a value judgment or second guessing of the\n\nLegislation. Such a test violates the separation of powers\n\nbetween the legislature and the judiciary. Even assuming that the\n\n‘least intrusive method’ test applies, the exercise of determining\n\nthe least intrusive method of identification is a technical exercise\n\nand cannot be undertaken in the court of law. Moreover, the\n\nPetitioners, who have furnished smartcards as an alternative,\n\nhave not established that smartcards are less intrusive than the\n\nAadhaar card authentication process.\n\nThe argument of applying the ‘Strict Scrutiny Test’ to test\n\nthe Constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act by the Petitioners was\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 321 of 567\n\nflawed. Strict scrutiny test is a test conceptualised in the United\n\nStates, only applied to ‘super suspect legislations’. This\n\ncompulsion arises because the scope of reasonable restrictions\n\nnot having been specified specifically in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThat leaves the scrutiny of the Legislations by the courts based\n\non the due process clause in the U.S. Constitution. Such a test\n\ndoes not have applicability in India. In Ashoka Kumar Thakur\n\n(2008) 6 SCC 1, the court referred to the test of strict scrutiny,\n\nnarrow tailoring and compelling interest and observed that these\n\nprinciples cannot be applied directly to India as affirmative action\n\nis Constitutionally supported.\n\n(iii) Act satisfies Proportionality Test\n\nLd. Attorney General submitted that the legitimate state\n\ninterest that the Aadhaar Act fulfils are prevention of leakages and\n\ndissipation of subsidies and social welfare benefits that are\n\ncovered under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act. He also submits that\n\nthe larger public/state interest is to be decided by the State and\n\ncannot be second guessed by the Judiciary. The state had\n\nrejected the idea of ‘smart cards’ and other alternative models\n\nafter due deliberations.\n\nThe learned Attorney General cited various reports\n\nhighlighting leakages, wastage, high costs and inefficiencies in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 322 of 567\n\nthe Public Distribution System, MGNREGA scheme and fuel\n\nsubsidy. He cited the Thirteenth Finance Commission Report\n\n2010-2015 which stated that creation of a biometric-based unique\n\nidentity for all residents in the country has potential to\n\naddress need of the government to ensure that only eligible\n\npersons are provided subsidies and that all eligible persons\n\nare covered. He also cited the Economic Surveys of 2014-15 and\n\n2015-16 both of which dilated upon the benefits of Aadhaar. The\n\n2015-16 Survey says that the use of Aadhaar has significantly\n\nreduced leakages in LPG and MGNREGA with limited\n\nexclusion of the poor by linking households' LPG customer\n\nnumbers with Aadhaar numbers to eliminate ‘ghosts’ and\n\nduplicate households from beneficiary rolls. The United\n\nNations, in its report titled ‘Leaving No One Behind: the\n\nimperative of inclusive development’, praised India’s decision of\n\nlaunching Aadhaar as it will be a step forward in ensuring\n\ninclusion of all people especially the poorest and the most\n\nmarginalized.\n\nThis court in the case of\nPUCL v. Union of India85\nhas\n\napproved the recommendations of the High-powered committee\n\nheaded by Justice D.P Wadhwa, which recommended linking\n\n85 (2011) 14 SCC 331\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 323 of 567\n\nof Aadhaar with PDS and encouraged State Governments to\n\nadopt the same. The court also lauded the efforts of State\n\ngovernment for using biometric identification.\n\nHe also referred to\n\nthe case of\nBinoy Viswam v. Union of India86\nwhere the economic\n\nrationale for and benefits of Aadhaar was discussed and\n\nvalidated.\n\nMr. Dwivedi has argued that 3% of GDP amounting to\n\ntrillions of rupees is allocated by Governments towards subsidies,\n\nscholarships, pensions, education, food and other welfare\n\nprogrammes. But approximately half of if does not reach the\n\nintended beneficiaries. Aadhaar is necessary for fixing this\n\nproblem as there is no other identification document which is\n\nwidely and commonly possessed by the residents of the country\n\nand most of the identity documents do not enjoy the quality of\n\nportability. Moreover, Aadhaar lends assurance and accuracy on\n\naccount of existence of fake, bogus and ghost cards, vide the\n\nprocess of de-duplication and authentication. De-duplication is\n\nensured by the three sub systems are :- (i) demographic de-\n\nduplication (ii) multi-ABIS multi-modal biometric de-duplication (iii)\n\nmanual adjudication. Biometric system provides high accuracy of\n\nover 99.86 %. The mixed biometric have been adopted only to\n\n86 (2017) 7 SCC 59\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 324 of 567\n\nenhance the accuracy and to reduce the errors which may arise\n\non account of some residents either not having biometrics or not\n\nhaving some particular biometric.\n\n(iv) Act empowers various facets of right to life under\nArticle 21\n\nThe Ld. Attorney General submitted that\nSection 7\nof the Act\n\nis traceable to\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. Right to life is not a\n\nmere animal existence but the right to live with human dignity\n\nwhich includes the right to food, the right to shelter, right to\n\nemployment, right to medical care, etc. Fulfilling these rights will\n\njustify the minimal invasion of the right to privacy of the citizens.\n\nThe counsel for the respondent also referred to the case of\n\nG. Sundarrajan v. Union of India87\nin which the petitioner therein\n\nchallenged the violation of their Right to the Life due to the risk\n\nposed by the Kudanakulam Nuclear Plant. The court struck a\n\nbalance between production of nuclear energy, which was of\n\nextreme importance for the economic growth, alleviation of\n\npoverty, generation of employment , and the violation of right to\n\nlife and dignity under\nArticle 21\nposed by the threat of a nuclear\n\ndisaster. The court observed that adequate safety measure –\n\nboth in design and operation - had been taken hence the violation\n\nof right to life was justified.\n\n87 (2013) 6 SCC 670\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 325 of 567\n\n253) The argument of ‘illusory consent’ was refuted with the\n\nsubmission that\nSection 7\nof the Act which mandatorily requires\n\nAadhaar for receipt of benefit, service or subsidy linked to the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India, does not violate any Fundamental\n\nRights. It involves a balancing of two Fundamental Rights: the\n\nRight to Privacy and the positive obligation of the State to ensure\n\nright to food, shelter and employment under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution. Aadhaar enables furtherance of\nArticle 21\nby\n\neliminating leakages and ensuring that no deserving individual is\n\ndenied her/his entitlement. The object of the Act i.e. the\n\nefficient, transparent and targeted delivery of subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services to genuine beneficiaries is in,\n\nfurtherance of various facets of\nArticle 21\nof the poor people\n\nof India and in furtherance of the Directive Principles of\n\nState Policy inter alia Articles 38,39, 41, 43, 47 and 48.\n\n254) It was further argued that\nSection 7\nis not a restriction at all and it\n\ndoes not require any surrender of Fundamental Rights. It is\n\nmerely a regulatory procedure to receipt of subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice.\nSection 7\npurports to enliven the Fundamental Right\n\nunder\nArticle 21\n, and\nArticle 14.\nTo achieve the goal of enlivening\n\nFundamental Rights of the poor and the deprived and to prevent\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 326 of 567\n\nsiphoning off the benefits, service or subsidy, it becomes\n\nnecessary to require compliance with the condition of undergoing\n\nauthentication.\n\n255) Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act protects right to human dignity\n\nrecognized by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. Aadhaar is used as\n\nmeans of authentication for availing services, benefits and\n\nsubsidies. Welfare schemes funded from the consolidated fund of\n\nIndia such as PDS, scholarship, mid day meals, LPG subsidies,\n\nfree education ensure that the Right to Life and Dignity of citizens\n\nare being enforced, which includes Justice (Social, Political and\n\nEconomic). It also eliminates inequality with a view to ameliorate\n\nthe poor, Dalits and other downtrodden classes and sections of\n\nthe society.\n\n256) In response to the argument that Fundamental Right to Privacy\n\ncannot be waived, the Mr.Dwivedi submits that Section 7 of the\n\nAadhaar Act does not involve any issue of waiver. When an\n\nindividual undergoes any authentication to establish his identity to\n\nreceive benefits, services or subsidy, he does so to enliven his\n\nFundamental Right to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21.\n\nWhen an individual makes a choice to enter into a relational\n\nsphere then his choice as to mode of identification would\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 327 of 567\n\nautomatically get restricted on account of the autonomy of the\n\nindividuals or institution with whom he wishes to relate. This is\n\nmore so where the individual seeks employment, service ,\n\nsubsidy or benefits. Moreover, Aadhaar is of a Universal nature,\n\nunlike any other identification card which are not portable. They\n\ngenerally have a localized value and limited purpose.\n\n257) In response to the arguments of the petitioners that Aadhaar\n\nreduces individuals to numbers, it was submitted that the\n\nAadhaar number is absolutely necessary for authentication and it\n\nis solely used for that purpose. It was argued that the petitioner\n\nhave conflated the concepts of identity and identification.\n\nAuthentication is merely an identification process and does not\n\nalter the identity of an individual. Further Aadhaar number is a\n\nrandomly generated number and bears no relation to the\n\nattributes of individuals. It is similar to an examiner allotting codes\n\nto examinees for administrative convenience.\n\n258) It was also argued that the State has an obligation to enlivening\n\nright to food, right to shelter etc envisaged under\nArticle 21\nand\n\nfor this purpose they may encroach upon the right of privacy of\n\nthe beneficiaries. The state requires to strike a fair balance\n\nbetween the right of privacy and right to life of beneficiaries. An\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 328 of 567\n\nexample furnished by the counsel for this is the Prohibition Of\n\nEmployment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act,\n\n2013, which restricts a scavenger’s right to practice any\n\nprofession, occupation, trade or business under\nArticle 19(g)\nis\n\norder to enliven\nArticle 21\nand\n17.\nThe counsel also gave the\n\nexample of the practice of dwarftossing, which was banned in\n\nFrance. The law was challenged on ground that it interferes with\n\nthe economic right of one practicing it. The challenge was\n\nnegatived on the ground that permitting such a practice even\n\nthough voluntary will be degrading of human dignity by Human\n\nRight Committee. Certain choices are restricted /prohibited by the\n\nConstitution itself (Articles 17,18, 23 and 24).\nArticle 23\nabolishes\n\nforced labour so it prohibits even those choosing to indulge in\n\nforced labour from doing so. The aforesaid actually result in\n\nenhancement of the Fundamental Right. The person is\n\nemancipated from a social condition which is below human\n\ndignity. Similarly\nSection 7\nof the Act involves an identification for\n\nthe purpose of enhancing human dignity.\n\n259) In response to the argument of Aadhaar causing exclusion, the\n\nlearned Attorney General responded by saying that if\n\nauthentication fails, despite more than one attempt, then the\n\npossession of Aadhaar number can be proved otherwise i.e. by\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 329 of 567\n\nproducing the Aadhaar card. And those who do not have Aadhaar\n\nnumber can make an application for enrolment and produce the\n\nenrolment id number).\n\n260) Before we proceed to analyse the respective submissions, it has\n\nalso to be kept in mind that all matters pertaining to an individual\n\ndo not qualify as being an inherent part of right to privacy. Only\n\nthose matters over which there would be a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy are protected by\nArticle 21.\nThis can be\n\ndiscerned from the reading of Paras 297 to 307 of the judgment,\n\nrelevant portions whereof have already been quoted above.\n\n261) We may also clarify that the arguments of privacy are examined\n\nin the context of\nSections 7\nand\nand the provisions related\n\nthereto under the Aadhaar Act. Validity of the other provisions of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act, which is questioned in these proceedings, is\n\ndealt with separately. As per Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act in case\n\nan individual wants to avail any subsidy benefit or services, she is\n\nrequired to produce the Aadhaar number and, therefore, it\n\nvirtually becomes compulsory for such a person. To that extent\n\nthe petitioners may be right in submitting that even if enrolment in\n\nAadhaar is voluntary, it assumes the character of compulsory\n\nenrolment for those who want to avail the benefits under Section\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 330 of 567\n\n7. Likewise, authentication, as mentioned in\nSection 8\n, also\n\nbecomes imperative. The relevant question, therefore, is as to\n\nwhether invasion into this privacy meets the triple requirements or\n\nright to privacy.\n\n(i) Requirement of law : The Parliament has now passed\n\nAadhaar Act, 2016\n. Therefore, law on the subject in the form of a\n\nstatute very much governs the field and, thus, first requirement\n\nstands satisfied. We may point out at this stage that insofar as\n\nperiod from 2009 (when the Aadhaar scheme was launched with\n\nthe creation of Authority vide notification No. A-43011/02/2009-\n\nAdmin. I dated January 28, 2009 till the date Aadhaar Act came\n\ninto force i.e. March 26, 2016, it is the argument of the petitioners\n\nthat insofar as this period is concerned, it is not backed by any\n\nlaw and, therefore, notification dated January 28, 2009 should be\n\nstruck down on this ground itself and all acts done including\n\nenrolment under the Aadhaar scheme from 2009 to 2016 should\n\nbe invalidated. This aspect we propose to deal at a later stage.\n\nAt this juncture, we are looking into the vires of Aadhaar Act. In\n\nthat context, the first requirement stands fulfilled.\n\n(ii) Whether Aadhaar Act serves legitimate State aim?\n\n‘Introduction’ to the said Act gives the reasons for passing\n\nthat Act and the ‘Statement of Objects and Reasons’ mentions\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 331 of 567\n\nthe objectives sought to be achieved with the enactment of the\n\nAadhaar Act. ‘Introduction’ reads as under:\n\n“The Unique Identification Authority of India was\nestablished by a resolution of the Government of\nIndia in 2009. It was meant primarily to lay down\npolicies and to implement the Unique Identification\nScheme, by which residents of India were to be\nprovided unique identity number. This number would\nserve as proof of identity and could be used for\nidentification of beneficiaries for transfer of benefits,\nsubsidies, services and other purposes.\n\nLater on, it was felt that the process of enrolment,\nauthentication, security, confidentiality and use of\nAadhaar related information be made statutory so as\nto facilitate the use of Aadhaar number for delivery of\nvarious benefits, subsidies and services, the\nexpenditures of which were incurred from or receipts\ntherefrom formed part of the Consolidated Fund of\nIndia.\n\nThe Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and\nOther Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016\ninter alia, provides for establishment of Unique\nIdentification Authority of India, issuance of Aadhaar\nnumber to individuals, maintenance and updating of\ninformation in the Central Identities Data Repository,\nissues pertaining to security, privacy and\nconfidentiality of information as well as offences and\npenalties for contravention of relevant statutory\nprovisions.”\n\nIn the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is inter alia\n\nmentioned that though number of social benefits schemes have\n\nbeen floated by the Government, the failure to establish identity of\n\nan individual has proved to be a major hindrance for successful\n\nimplementation of those programmes as it was becoming difficult\n\nto ensure that subsidies, benefits and services reach the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 332 of 567\n\nunintended beneficiaries in the absence of a credible system to\n\nauthenticate identity of beneficiaries. The Statement of Objects\n\nand Reasons also discloses that over a period of time, the use of\n\nAadhaar number has been increased manifold and, therefore, it is\n\nalso necessary to take measures relating to ensuring security of\n\nthe information provided by the individuals while enrolling for\n\nAadhaar card. Having these parameters in mind, Para 5 of the\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons enumerates the objectives\n\nwhich the Aadhaar Act seeks to achieve. It reads as under:\n\n“5. The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and\nOther Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016\ninter alia, seeks to provide for—\n\n(a) issue of Aadhaar numbers to individuals on\nproviding his demographic and biometric information\nto the Unique Identification Authority of India;\n\n(b) requiring Aadhaar numbers for identifying an\nindividual for delivery of benefits, subsidies, and\nservices the expenditure is incurred from or the\nreceipt therefrom forms part of the Consolidated Fund\nof India;\n\n(c) authentication of the Aadhaar number of an\nAadhaar number holder in relation to his demographic\nand biometric information;\n\n(d) establishment of the Unique Identification\nAuthority of India consisting of a Chairperson, two\nMembers and a Member-Secretary to perform\nfunctions in pursuance of the objectives above;\n\n(e) maintenance and updating the information of\nindividuals in the Central Identities Data Repository in\nsuch manner as may be specified by regulations;\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 333 of 567\n\n(f) measures pertaining to security, privacy and\nconfidentiality of information in possession or control\nof the Authority including information stored in the\nCentral Identities Data Repository; and\n\n(g) offences and penalties for contravention of\nrelevant statutory provisions.”\n\n262) After taking into consideration the Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons, a two Judge Bench of this Court in Binoy Viswam v.\n\nUnion of India & Ors.88, recapitulated the objectives of Aadhaar in\n\nthe following manner:\n\n“125. By making use of the technology, a method is sought\nto be devised, in the form of Aadhaar, whereby identity of a\nperson is ascertained in a flawless manner without giving\nany leeway to any individual to resort to dubious practices\nof showing multiple identities or fictitious identities. That is\nwhy it is given the nomenclature “unique identity”. It is\naimed at securing advantages on different levels some of\nwhich are described, in brief, below:\n\n125.1. In the first instance, as a welfare and democratic\nState, it becomes the duty of any responsible Government\nto come out with welfare schemes for the upliftment of\npoverty-stricken and marginalised sections of the society.\n\nThis is even the ethos of Indian Constitution which casts a\nduty on the State, in the form of “directive principles of\nState policy”, to take adequate and effective steps for\nbetterment of such underprivileged classes. State is bound\nto take adequate measures to provide education, health\ncare, employment and even cultural opportunities and\nsocial standing to these deprived and underprivileged\nclasses. It is not that Government has not taken steps in\nthis direction from time to time. At the same time, however,\nharsh reality is that benefits of these schemes have not\nreached those persons for whom that are actually meant.\n\n125.1.1. India has achieved significant economic growth\nsince Independence. In particular, rapid economic growth\nhas been achieved in the last 25 years, after the country\n\n88 (2017) 7 SCC 59\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 334 of 567\n\nadopted the policy of liberalisation and entered the era of,\nwhat is known as, globalisation. Economic growth in the\nlast decade has been phenomenal and for many years, the\nIndian economy grew at highest rate in the world. At the\nsame time, it is also a fact that in spite of significant\npolitical and economic success which has proved to be\nsound and sustainable, the benefits thereof have not\npercolated down to the poor and the poorest. In fact, such\nbenefits are reaped primarily by rich and upper middle\nclasses, resulting into widening the gap between the rich\nand the poor.\n\n125.1.2. Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen pithily narrate the\nposition as under [An Uncertain Glory : India and its\nContradictions] :\n\n“Since India's recent record of fast economic growth\nis often celebrated, with good reason, it is extremely\nimportant to point to the fact that the societal reach of\neconomic progress in India has been remarkably\nlimited. It is not only that the income distribution has\nbeen getting more unequal in recent years (a\ncharacteristic that India shares with China), but also\nthat the rapid rise in real wages in China from which\nthe working classes have benefited greatly is not\nmatched at all by India's relatively stagnant real\nwages. No less importantly, the public revenue\ngenerated by rapid economic growth has not been\nused to expand the social and physical infrastructure\nin a determined and well-planned way (in this India is\nleft far behind by China). There is also a continued\nlack of essential social services (from schooling and\nhealth care to the provision of safe water and\ndrainage) for a huge part of the population. As we will\npresently discuss, while India has been overtaking\nother countries in the progress of its real income, it\nhas been overtaken in terms of social indicators by\nmany of these countries, even within the region of\nSouth Asia itself (we go into this question more fully in\nChapter 3, ‘India in Comparative Perspective’).\n\nTo point to just one contrast, even though India\nhas significantly caught up with China in terms of\nGDP growth, its progress has been very much slower\nthan China's in indicators such as longevity, literacy,\nchild undernourishment and maternal mortality. In\nSouth Asia itself, the much poorer economy of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 335 of 567\n\nBangladesh has caught up with and overtaken India\nin terms of many social indicators (including life\nexpectancy, immunisation of children, infant mortality,\nchild undernourishment and girls' schooling). Even\nNepal has been catching up, to the extent that it now\nhas many social indicators similar to India's, in spite\nof its per capita GDP being just about one third.\nWhereas twenty years ago India generally had the\nsecond best social indicators among the six South\nAsian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri\nLanka, Nepal and Bhutan), it now looks second worst\n(ahead only of problem-ridden Pakistan). India has\nbeen climbing up the ladder of per capita income\nwhile slipping down the slope of social indicators.”\n\n125.1.3. It is in this context that not only sustainable\ndevelopment is needed which takes care of integrating\ngrowth and development, thereby ensuring that the benefit\nof economic growth is reaped by every citizen of this\ncountry, it also becomes the duty of the Government in a\nwelfare State to come out with various welfare schemes\nwhich not only take care of immediate needs of the\ndeprived class but also ensure that adequate opportunities\nare provided to such persons to enable them to make their\nlives better, economically as well as socially. As mentioned\nabove, various welfare schemes are, in fact, devised and\nfloated from time to time by the Government, keeping aside\nsubstantial amount of money earmarked for spending on\nsocially and economically backward classes. However, for\nvarious reasons including corruption, actual benefit does\nnot reach those who are supposed to receive such\nbenefits. One of the main reasons is failure to identify these\npersons for lack of means by which identity could be\nestablished of such genuine needy class. Resultantly, lots\nof ghosts and duplicate beneficiaries are able to take\nundue and impermissible benefits. A former Prime Minister\nof this country [ Late Shri Rajiv Gandhi] has gone on record\nto say that out of one rupee spent by the Government for\nwelfare of the downtrodden, only 15 paisa thereof actually\nreaches those persons for whom it is meant. It cannot be\ndoubted that with UID/Aadhaar much of the malaise in this\nfield can be taken care of.\n\n263) It may be highlighted at this stage that the petitioners are making\n\ntheir claim on the basis of dignity as a facet of right to privacy. On\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 336 of 567\n\nthe other hand, Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act is aimed at offering\n\nsubsidies, benefits or services to the marginalised section of the\n\nsociety for whom such welfare schemes have been formulated\n\nfrom time to time. That also becomes an aspect of social justice,\n\nwhich is the obligation of the State stipulated in Para IV of the\n\nConstitution. The rationale behind\nSection 7\nlies in ensuring\n\ntargeted delivery of services, benefits and subsidies which are\n\nfunded from the Consolidated Fund of India. In discharge of its\n\nsolemn Constitutional obligation to enliven the Fundamental\n\nRights of life and personal liberty (\nArticle 21\n) to ensure Justice,\n\nSocial, Political and Economic and to eliminate inequality (Article\n\n14) with a view to ameliorate the lot of the poor and the Dalits, the\n\nCentral Government has launched several welfare schemes.\n\nSome such schemes are PDS, scholarships, mid day meals, LPG\n\nsubsidies, etc. These schemes involve 3% percentage of the\n\nGDP and involve a huge amount of public money. Right to\n\nreceive these benefits, from the point of view of those who\n\ndeserve the same, has now attained the status of fundamental\n\nright based on the same concept of human dignity, which the\n\npetitioners seek to bank upon. The Constitution does not exist for\n\na few or minority of the people of India, but “We the people”. The\n\ngoals set out in the Preamble of the Constitution do not\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 337 of 567\n\ncontemplate statism and do not seek to preserve justice, liberty,\n\nequality an fraternity for those who have the means and\n\nopportunity to ensure the exercise of inalienable rights for\n\nthemselves. These goals are predominantly or at least equally\n\ngeared to “secure to all its citizens”, especially, to the\n\ndowntrodden, poor and exploited, justice, liberty, equality and “to\n\npromote” fraternity assuring dignity. Interestingly, the State has\n\ncome forward in recognising the rights of deprived section of the\n\nsociety to receive such benefits on the premise that it is their\n\nfundamental right to claim such benefits. It is acknowledged by\n\nthe respondents that there is a paradigm shift in addressing the\n\nproblem of security and eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.\n\nThe shift is from the welfare approach to a right based approach.\n\nAs a consequence, right of everyone to adequate food no more\n\nremains based on Directive Principles of State Policy (Art 47),\n\nthough the said principles remain a source of inspiration. This\n\nentitlement has turned into a Constitutional fundamental right.\n\nThis Constitutional obligation is reinforced by obligations under\n\nInternational Convention. The Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights (Preamble,\nArticle 22\n\n& 23\n) and International Covenant on\n\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights to which India is a\n\nsignatory, also casts responsibilities on all State parties to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 338 of 567\n\nrecognize the right of everyone to adequate food. Eradicating\n\nextreme poverty and hunger is one of the goals under the\n\nMillennium Development Goals of the United Nations. The\n\nParliament enacted the\nNational Security Food Act, 2013\nto\n\naddress the issue of food security at the household level. The\n\nscheme of the Act designs a targeted public distribution system\n\nfor providing food grains to those below BPL. The object is to\n\nensure to the people adequate food at affordable prices so that\n\npeople may live a life with dignity. The reforms contemplated\n\nunder\nSection 12\nof the Act include, application of information and\n\ncommunication technology tools with end to end computerization\n\nto ensure transparency and to prevent diversion, and leveraging\n\nAadhaar for unique biometric identification of entitled\n\nbeneficiaries.\nThe Act\nimposes obligations on the Central\n\nGovernment, State Government and local authorities vide\n\nChapter VIII, IX and X.\nSection 32\ncontemplates other welfare\n\nschemes. It provides for nutritional standards in Schedule II and\n\nthe undertaking of further steps to progressively realize the\n\nobjectives specified in Schedule III.\n\n264) At this juncture, we would also like to mention that historic\n\njudgment of this Court in\nHis Holiness Kesavananda Bharati\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 339 of 567\n\nSripadagalvaru v. State of Kerala & Anr.89\nemphasised on the\n\nattainment of socio-economic rights and its interplay with\n\nfundamental rights. Following passages from the opinion\n\nrendered by Khanna, J. need a specific mention:\n\n“1477. I may also refer to another passage on p. 99 of\nGrammar of Politics by Harold Laski:\n\n“The state, therefore, which seeks to survive must\ncontinually transform itself to the demands of men\nwho have an equal claim upon that common welfare\nwhich is its ideal purpose to promote.\n\nWe are concerned here, not with the defence of\nanarchy, but with the conditions of its avoidance. Men\nmust learn to subordinate their self-interest to the\ncommon welfare. The privileges of some must give\nway before the rights of all. Indeed, it may be urged\nthat the interest of the few is in fact the attainment of\nthose rights, since in no other environment is stability\nto be assured.”\n\n1478. A modern State has to usher in and deal with large\nschemes having social and economic content. It has to\nundertake the challenging task of what has been called\nsocial engineering, the essential aim of which is the\neradication of the poverty, uplift of the downtrodden, the\nraising of the standards of the vast mass of people and the\nnarrowing of the gulf between the rich and the poor. As\noccasions arise quite often when the individual rights clash\nwith the larger interests of the society, the State acquires\nthe power to subordinate the individual rights to the larger\ninterests of society as a step towards social justice. As\nobserved by Roscoe Pound on p. 434 of Volume I of\nJurisprudence under the heading “Limitations on the Use of\nProperty”:\n\n“Today the law is imposing social limitations —\nlimitations regarded as involved in social life. It is\nendeavouring to delimit the individual interest better\nwith respect to social interests and to confine the\n\n89 (1973) 4 SCC 225\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 340 of 567\n\nlegal right or liberty or privilege to the bounds of the\ninterest so delimited.”\n\nTo quote the words of Friedmann in Legal Theory:\n\n“But modern democracy looks upon the right to\nproperty as one conditioned by social responsibility\nby the needs of society, by the ‘balancing of interests’\nwhich looms so large in modern jurisprudence, and\nnot as pre-ordained and untouchable private right.”\n(Fifth Edition, p. 406).”\n\n265) It would also be worthwhile to mark, in continuity with the\n\naforesaid thought, what Dwivedi, J. emphasised.\n\n“...The Nation stands to-day at the cross-roads of history\nand exchanging the time-honoured place of the phrase,\nmay I say that the Directive Principles of State Policy\nshould not be permitted to become “a mere rope of\nsand”. If the State fails to create conditions in which the\nfundamental freedoms could be enjoyed by all, the\nfreedom of the few will be at the mercy of the many and\nthen all freedoms will vanish. In order, therefore, to\npreserve their freedom, the privileged few must part with\na portion of it.”\n\n266) By no stretch of imagination, therefore, it can be said that there is\n\nno defined State aim in legislating Aadhaar Act. We may place\n\non record that even the petitioners did not seriously question the\n\npurpose bona fides of the legislature in enacting this law. In a\n\nwelfare State, where measures are taken to ameliorate the\n\nsufferings of the downtrodden, the aim of the Act is to ensure that\n\nthese benefits actually reach the populace for whom they are\n\nmeant. This is naturally a legitimate State aim.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 341 of 567\n\n(iii) Whether Aadhaar Act meets the test of proportionality?\n\n267) The concept and contours of doctrine of proportionality have\n\nalready been discussed in detail. We have also indicated the\n\napproach that we need to adopt while examining the issue of\n\nproportionality. This discussion bring out that following four sub-\n\ncomponents of proportionality need to be satisfied:\n\n(a) A measure restricting a right must have a legitimate goal\n\n(legitimate goal stage).\n\n(b) It must be a suitable means of furthering this goal (suitability\n\nor rationale connection stage).\n\n(c) There must not be any less restrictive but equally effective\n\nalternative (necessity stage).\n\n(d) The measure must not have a disproportionate impact on\n\nthe right holder (balancing stage).\n\n268) We now proceed to examine as to whether these components\n\nmeet the required parameters in the instant case.\n\n(a) Legitimate Goal Stage: At this stage, the exercise which\n\nneeds to be undertaken is to see that the State has legitimate\n\ngoal in restricting the right. It is also to be seen that such a goal\n\nis of sufficient importance justifying overriding a constitutional\n\nright of freedom. Further, it impairs freedom as little as possible.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 342 of 567\n\n269) In our preceding discussion, we have already pointed out above\n\nthat Aadhaar Act serves the legitimate state aim. That, in fact,\n\nprovides answer to this component as well. Some additions to\n\nthe said discussion is as follows:\n\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that various welfare\n\nschemes for marginalised section of the society have been\n\nfloated by the successive governments from time to time in last\n\nfew decades. These include giving ration at reasonable cost\n\nthrough ration shops (keeping in view Right to Food), according\n\ncertain benefits to those who are below poverty line with the\n\nissuance of BPL Cards, LPG connections and LPG cylinders at\n\nminimal costs, old age and other kinds of pensions to deserving\n\npersons, scholarships, employment to unemployed under\n\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act,\n(MGNREGA) Scheme. There is an emergence of socio-\n\neconomic rights, not only in India but in many other countries\n\nworld-wide. There is, thus, recognisation of civil and political\n\nrights on the one hand and emergence of socio-economic rights\n\non the other hand. The boundaries between civil and political\n\nrights review as well as socio-economic rights review are rapidly\n\ncrumbling. This rights jurisprudence created in India is a telling\n\nexample.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 343 of 567\n\n270) This Court has developed a reputation as both a protector of\n\nHuman Rights and an engine of economic and social reforms.\nIn\n\nPeople’s Union for\nCivil Liberties (PUCL) v. Union of India90\n, the\n\nCourt’s treatment of Right to Food as a fundamental right has\n\nbeen seen as victory for India’s impoverished population. The\n\nCourt had passed orders enforcing the Government to take steps\n\nto ensure the effective implementation of the Food Distribution\n\nSchemes created by the Famine Code. Series of interim orders\n\nwere passed aimed at bringing immediate relief to the drought\n\naffected individuals. The benefits of the schemes were converted\n\ninto legal entitlements by orders dated November 28, 2001\n\npassed in the said case. Amongst other things, the Court ordered\n\ngovernment to complete the identification of people who fell into\n\nthe groups targeted for food distribution, issue cards to allow\n\nthese people to collect the grain and distribute the grain to the\n\nrelevant centres. The order also provided for governmental\n\ninspections to ensure fair quality grain. In this and subsequent\n\norders, the court set the requirements on reporting,\n\naccountability, monitoring, transparency and dissemination of\n\ncourt orders aimed at ensuring that its orders are followed.\n\n271) The purpose behind these orders was to ensure that the\n90 (2001) 5 Scale 303\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 344 of 567\n\ndeserving beneficiaries of the scheme are correctly identified and\n\nare able to receive the benefits under the said scheme, which is\n\ntheir entitlement. The orders also aimed at ensuring ‘good\n\ngovernance’ by bringing accountability and transparency in the\n\ndistribution system with the pious aim in mind, namely, benefits\n\nactually reached those who are rural, poor and starving.\n\n272) Again, in People’s Union for\nCivil Liberties (PUCL\n) case, orders\n\ndated January 20, 2010 were passed by the Division Bench of\n\nthis Court directing the Government of Delhi to respond to the\n\nextreme weather conditions ‘by setting up more shelters and\n\nprotecting homeless people from the cold’. The assurance was\n\nextracted from the then Additional Solicitor General on behalf of\n\nthe Government that affected people would be provided with\n\nshelter as a matter of priority and that arrangement should be\n\nmade for this within a day.\n\n273) In the context of Right to Education, this Court in\nState of Bihar &\n\nOrs. v. Project Uchcha Vidya, Sikshak Sangh & Ors.91\npassed\n\norders on January 3, 2006 thereby directing that a committee be\n\nappointed to investigate departures from the State of Bihar’s\n\npolicy concerning the establishment of ‘Project Schools’ aimed at\n\nimproving its poor education record. The Court appointed a\n\n91 Civil Appeal No. 6626-6675 of 2001\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 345 of 567\n\ncommittee to investigate the matter. The Court’s order included\n\ndetails as to the composition and functions of the committee,\n\nguidelines as to what would constitute irregularities in the\n\nimplementation of the policy and an expectation that the State of\n\nBihar would take remedial action if the committee found any\n\nirregularities. The Court’s approach to affirmative action in\n\neducation is also instructive.\n\n274) In\nAshoka Thakur v. Union of India92\n, the Court upheld the Ninety-\n\nThird Amendment to the Constitution, which allows for certain\n\neducational institutions to put in place special admissions rules in\n\norder to advance India’s ‘socially or educationally backward\n\nclasses of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled\n\nTribes’.93 The Court held that people who are wealthier and\n\nbetter educated (the ‘creamy layer’) should be excluded from the\n\n27 per cent quota for ‘Other Backward Classes’ (OBC). This\n\nstep was needed to ensure that benefits reached those people\n\nliving in desperate poverty. In addition, the inclusion of particular\n\ngroups in the OBC category had to be reviewed every five years.\n\n275) In\nPaschim Banga Ket Mazdoor Samity v. State of West Bengal94\n,\n\nthe Court found that\nArticle 21\nencompasses a right to adequate\n92 Writ Petition (Civil) No. 265 of 2006, judgment delivered on April 10, 2008.\n93 The challenge made in the case related to ‘Other Backward Classes’ rather than the Scheduled\nCastes or Tribes.\n\n94 (1996) 4 SCC 37\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 346 of 567\n\nmedical facilities or health care. It also interpreted other\n\nfundamental rights in light of directive principles. Likewise, in\n\nMohini Jain v. State of Kerala & Ors.95, the Court held that the\n\nright to equality before the law in\nArticle 14\nincludes a right to\n\neducation.\nIn the subsequent case,\nUnnikrishnan v. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh96\n, the Court clarified its findings in Mohini Jain,\n\nstating that\nArticle 14\ngave rise to a right to primary education.\n\nFollowing the cases on education, in 1997 the Indian government\n\nproposed a constitutional Amendment recognising education for\n\nchildren under 14 as a fundamental right. This Amendment was\n\npassed in 2002 as\nArticle 21A.\nOne of the Court’s earliest cases\n\ndealing with the role of the directive principles in constitutional\n\ninterpretation is arguably also its most celebrated judgment.\n\nSome commentators see the decision in\nOlga Tellis & Ors. v.\n\nBombay Municipal Corporation & Ors.97\nas a recognition of\n\nenforceable right to shelter.\n\n276) The purpose of citing aforesaid judgments is to highlight that this\n\nCourt expanded the scope of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution by recognising various socio-economic rights of the\n\npoor and marginalised section of the society and, in the process,\n\n95 (1992) 3 SCC 666\n96 (1993) 1 SCC 645\n97 1985 SCR Supl. (2) 51\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 347 of 567\n\ntransforming the constitutional jurisprudence by putting a positive\n\nobligation on the State to fulfill its duty as per the Charter of\n\nDirective Principles of the State Policy, contained in Part IV of the\n\nConstitution. It is to be kept in mind that while acknowledging\n\nthat economic considerations would play a role in determining the\n\nfull content of the right to life, the Court also held that right\n\nincluded the protection of human dignity and all that is attached to\n\nit, ‘namely, the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition,\n\nclothing and shelter and facilities for reading, writing and\n\nexpressing oneself in diverse forms’ (See\nFrancis Coralie Mullin\n\nv. The Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi & Ors.\n98). It is, thus,\n\nof some significance to remark that it is this Court which has been\n\nrepeatedly insisting that benefits to reach the most deserving and\n\nshould not get frittered mid-way. We are of the opinion that\n\npurpose of Aadhaar Act, as captured in the Statement of Objects\n\nand Reasons and sought to be implemented by Section 7 of the\n\nAadhaar Act, is to achieve the stated objectives. This Court is\n\nconvinced by its conscience that the Act is aimed at a proper\n\npurpose, which is of sufficient importance.\n\n(b) Suitability or rationale connection stage:\n\n277) We are also of the opinion that the measures which are\n\n98 (1981) 2 SCR 516\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 348 of 567\n\nenumerated and been taken as per the provisions of\nSection 7\n\nread with Section 5 of the Aadhaar Act are rationally connected\n\nwith the fulfillment of the objectives contained in the Aadhaar Act.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the scheme for enrolling under the\n\nAadhaar Act and obtaining the Aadhaar number is optional and\n\nvoluntary. It is given the nomenclature of unique identity. A\n\nperson with Aadhaar number gets an identity. No doubt, there\n\nare many other modes by which a person can be identified.\n\nHowever, certain categories of persons, particularly those living in\n\nabject poverty and those who are illiterate will not be in a position\n\nto get other modes of identity like Pan Card, Passport etc. That\n\napart giving unique identity of each resident of the country is a\n\nspecial feature of this scheme, more so, when it comes with the\n\nfeature stated above, namely, no person can have more than one\n\nAadhaar number; Aadhaar number given to a particular person\n\ncannot be reassigned again to any individual even if that is\n\ncancelled and there is hardly any possibility to have fake identity.\n\n278) As pointed out above, enrolling for Aadhaar is not the serious\n\nconcern of the petitioners. It is only the process of authentication\n\nand other related issues which bothers the petitioners which shall\n\nbe considered at the appropriate stage. At this point of time, we\n\nare discussing the issue as to whether the limitation on the rights\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 349 of 567\n\nof the individuals is rationally connected to the fulfillment of the\n\npurpose contained in the Aadhaar Act. Here,\nSection 5\ntalks of\n\nspecial measures for issuance of Aadhaar number to certain\n\ncategories of persons. It gives identity to those persons who\n\notherwise may not have any such identity. In that manner, it\n\nrecognises them as residents of this nation and in that form gives\n\nthem their ‘dignity’.\n\n279)\nSection 7\n, which provides for necessity of authentication for\n\nreceipt of certain subsidies, benefits and services has a definite\n\npurpose and this authentication is to achieve the objectives for\n\nwhich Aadhaar Act is enacted, namely, to ensure that such\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services reach only the intended\n\nbeneficiaries. We have seen rampant corruption at various levels\n\nin implementation of benevolent and welfare schemes meant for\n\ndifferent classes of persons. It has resulted in depriving the\n\nactual beneficiaries to receive those subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices which get frittered away though on papers, it is shown\n\nthat they are received by the persons for whom they are meant.\n\nThere have been cases of duplicate and bogus ration cards, BPL\n\ncards, LPG connections etc. Some persons with multiple\n\nidentities getting those benefits manifold. Aadhaar scheme has\n\nbeen successful, to a great extent, in curbing the aforesaid\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 350 of 567\n\nmalpractices. By providing that the benefits for various welfare\n\nschemes shall be given to those who possess Aadhaar number\n\nand after undergoing the authentication as provided in Section 8\n\nof the Aadhaar Act, the purpose is to ensure that only rightful\n\npersons receive these benefits. Non-action is not costly. It’s the\n\naffirmative action which costs the Government. And that money\n\ncomes from exchequer. So, it becomes the duty of the\n\nGovernment to ensure that it goes to deserving persons.\n\nTherefore, second component also stands fulfilled.\n\n(c) Necessity Stage:\n\n280) Insofar as third component is concerned, most of it stands\n\nanswered while in the discussion that has ensued in respect of\n\ncomponent No. 1 and 2. The manner in which malpractices have\n\nbeen committed in the past leaves us to hold that apart from the\n\nsystem of unique identity in Aadhaar and authentication of the\n\nreal beneficiaries, there is no alternative measure with lesser\n\ndegree of limitation which can achieve the same purpose. In fact,\n\non repeated query by this Court, even the petitioners could not\n\nsuggest any such method.\n\n(d) Balancing Stage:\n\n281) With this, we now advert to the most important component of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 351 of 567\n\nproportionality i.e. balancing between importance of achieving the\n\nproper purpose and the social importance of preventing the\n\nlimitation on the constitutional right.\n\n282) Argument of the petitioners is that Aadhaar project creates the\n\narchitect of surveillance state and society, which is antithetical to\n\nthe principles of democracy. It is premised on the basis that the\n\nAadhaar project enables the State to profile citizens, track their\n\nmovements, assess their habits and silently influence their\n\nbehaviour throughout their lives. It may stifle dissent and\n\ninfluence political decision making. It is also argued that\n\naggregation, storage and use of such stored information is\n\nviolative of fundamental right to privacy, dignity and individual\n\nautonomy. Informational privacy is expected as part of right to\n\nprivacy.\nThe Act\nallows data aggregation as well. Such an Act is\n\nunconstitutional as there is violation of a fundamental rights but\n\nthere is absence of procedural safeguards to protect data in the\n\nAct. It is also argued that extent of information collected with the\n\nuse of Aadhaar, specially by the methodology of authentication, is\n\nnot proportionate to the ‘compelling interest of the State’ and\n\nthere are various other methods available for identification. It is,\n\nthus, disproportionate and unreasonable state compulsion.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 352 of 567\n\n283) The respondents, on the other hand, have argued that there\n\ncannot be any reasonable expectation of privacy inasmuch as the\n\nAadhaar Act operates in the public and relationally sphere and\n\nnot in the core, private or personal sphere of the residents.\n\nMoreover, it involves minimal identity information for effective\n\nauthentication which stands the test of reasonableness.\nThe Act\n\nis, thus, least intrusive and strict scrutiny test does not apply in\n\nthe proportionality test. It is also the case of the respondents that\n\nthe Aadhaar Act does not allow aggregation at all and, therefore,\n\nall the apprehension are ill-founded and have no basis. It is also\n\nsubmitted that the Aadhaar Act is, in fact, the facilitator in\n\nempowering various facets of right to life under\nArticle 21\nand\n\nthereby ensures that unprivileged class is also able to live with\n\nhuman dignity.\n\n284) Before undertaking this exercise of balancing, we would like to\n\npoint out that we are not convinced with the argument of the\n\nrespondents that there cannot be any reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy. No doubt, the information which is gathered by the\n\nUIDAI (whether biometric or demographic) is parted with by the\n\nindividuals to other agencies/body corporates etc. in many other\n\nkinds of transactions as well, as pointed out by the respondents.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 353 of 567\n\nHowever, the matter is to be looked into from the angle that this\n\ninformation is collected and stored by the State or instrumentality\n\nof the State. Therefore, it becomes important to find out as to\n\nwhether it meets the test of proportionality, and satisfies the\n\ncondition that the measure must not have disproportionate impact\n\non the right-holder (balancing stage). However, at the same time,\n\nthe fact that such information about individuals is in public domain\n\nmay become a relevant factor in undertaking the exercise of\n\nbalancing.\n\n285) We have already traced the objectives with which the Aadhaar\n\nAct has been enacted. No doubt, there is a right to privacy, which\n\nis now entrenched in fundamental rights. On the other hand, we\n\nare also concerned with the rights of those persons whose dignity\n\nis sought to be ensured by giving them the facilities which are\n\nnecessary to live as dignified life. Therefore, balancing has to be\n\ndone at two levels:\n\n(i) Whether, ‘legitimate state interest’ ensures ‘reasonable\n\ntailoring’? There is a minimal intrusion into the privacy and the\n\nlaw is narrowly framed to achieve the objective.\nHere the Act\nis to\n\nbe tested on the ground that whether it is found on a balancing\n\ntest that the social or public interest and the reasonableness of\n\nthe restrictions outweigh the particular aspect of privacy, as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 354 of 567\n\nclaimed by the petitioners. This is the test we have applied in the\n\ninstant case.\n\n(ii) There needs to be balancing of two competing fundamental\n\nrights, right to privacy on the one hand and right to food, shelter\n\nand employment on the other hand. Axiomatically both the rights\n\nare founded on human dignity. At the same time, in the given\n\ncontext, two facets are in conflict with each other. The question\n\nhere would be, when a person seeks to get the benefits of welfare\n\nschemes to which she is entitled to as a part of right to live life\n\nwith dignity, whether her sacrifice to the right to privacy, is so\n\ninvasive that it creates imbalance?\n\n286) In a way, both the aforesaid questions have some overlapping\n\ninasmuch as even while finding answer to the second question, it\n\nwill have to be determined as to whether there is a least intrusion\n\ninto the privacy of a person while ensuring that the individual gets\n\nthe benefits under the welfare schemes.\n\n287) The respondents seemed to be right when they argue that all\n\nmatters pertaining to an individual do not qualify as being an\n\ninherent part of right to privacy. Only those which concern\n\nmatters over which there can be a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy would be protected by\nArticle 21.\nIn this behalf, we may\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 355 of 567\n\nrecapitulate the discussion on some significant aspects in\n\nPuttaswamy:\n\nPrivacy postulates the reservation of a private space,\n\ndescribed as the right to be let alone. The integrity of the body\n\nand the sanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation of the\n\nindividual’s ‘right to preserve a private space in which the human\n\npersonality can develop’ and this involves the ability to make\n\nchoices. In this sense privacy is a postulate of human dignity\n\nitself. The inviolable nature of the human personality is\n\nmanifested in the ability to make decisions on matters intimate to\n\nhuman life. The autonomy of the individual is associated ‘over\n\nmatters which can be kept private. These are concerns over\n\nwhich there is a legitimate expectation of privacy’. Thoughts and\n\nbehavioral patterns which are intimate to an individual are entitled\n\nto a zone of privacy where one is free of social expectations. In\n\nthat zone of privacy an individual is not judged by others. The\n\njudgment refers to the expert group report and identifies nine\n\nprivacy principles pertaining to notice, choice and consent,\n\ncollection limitation, purpose limitation, access and correction,\n\nnon disclosure of information, security of data, openness or\n\nproportionality as to the scale, scope and sensitivity to the data\n\ncollected, and accountability. At the same time, privacy is a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 356 of 567\n\nsubset of liberty. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. It\n\nlies across the spectrum of protected freedoms. Further, the\n\nnotion of reasonable expectation of privacy has both subjective\n\nand objective elements. At a subjective level it means ‘an\n\nindividual desires to be left alone’. On an objective plain privacy\n\nis defined by those Constitutional values which shape the content\n\nof the protected zone where the individual ‘ought to be left alone’.\n\nFurther, the notion of reasonable expectation of privacy ensures\n\nthat while on the one hand, the individual has a protected zone of\n\nprivacy, yet on the other ‘the exercise of individual choices is\n\nsubject the right of others to lead orderly lives’. The extent of the\n\nzone of privacy would, therefore, depend upon both the\n\nsubjective expectation and the objective principle which defines a\n\nreasonable expectation.\n\nIt is pertinent to point out that while dealing with\n\ninformational privacy, the judgment notes that privacy concerns\n\nare seriously an issue in the age of information. It also notes the\n\ndata mining processes together with knowledge discovery, and\n\nthe age of big data. The court finds that data regulation and\n\nindividual privacy raises complex issues requiring delicate\n\nbalances to be drawn between the legitimate concerns of the\n\nState and individual interest in the protection of privacy, and in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 357 of 567\n\nthis sphere, data protection assumes significance. Data such as\n\nmedical information would be a category to which a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy attaches. There may be other data which\n\nfalls outside the reasonable expectation paradigm. Data\n\nprotection regimes seek to protect the autonomy of the individual.\n\nThis is a complex exercise involving careful balancing. In this\n\nbalancing process, following parameters are to be kept in mind:\n\n(i) The judgment also holds that the legitimate expectation of\n\nprivacy may vary from the intimate zone to the private zone and\n\nfrom the private to the public arenas. However, ‘the privacy is not\n\nlost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public\n\nspace’.\n\n(ii) One of the chief concerns is that ‘while the web is a source\n\nof lawful activity – both personal and commercial, concerns of\n\nNational security intervene since the seamless structure of the\n\nweb can be exploited by terrorist to wreak havoc and destruction\n\non civilized societies.’ Noting an article of Richard A. Posner,\n\nwhich says ‘privacy is the terrorist’s best friend..’ It is observed\n\nthat this formulation indicates that State has legitimate interest\n\nwhen it monitors the web to secure the Nation.\n\n(iii) Apart from National security, State may have justifiable\n\nreasons for the collection and storage of data as where it\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 358 of 567\n\nembarks upon programs to provide benefits to impoverished and\n\nmarginalized sections of society and for ensuring that scarce\n\npublic resources are not dissipated and diverted to non-eligible\n\nrecipients. Digital platforms are a vital tool of ensuring good\n\ngovernance in a social welfare State and technology is a powerful\n\nenabler.\n\n288) In the first instance, therefore, it is to be seen as to whether the\n\npetitioners claim on the information supplied while authentication\n\nto be protected is based on reasonable expectation.\n\n289) ‘Reasonable Expectation’ involves two aspects. First, the\n\nindividual or individuals claiming a right to privacy must establish\n\nthat their claim involves a concern about some harm likely to be\n\ninflicted upon them on account of the alleged act. This concern\n\n‘should be real and not imaginary or speculative’. Secondly, ‘the\n\nconcern should not be flimsy or trivial’. It should be a reasonable\n\nconcern. It has to be borne in mind that the concept of\n\n‘reasonable expectation’ has its genesis in the US case laws. UK\n\njudgments adopted the test of reasonable expectation from the\n\nUS jurisprudence. The ECHR and ECJ judgments reveal a little\n\ndivergence with regard to right of privacy. The ECHR in general\n\nadopts the approach that ‘a person’s reasonable expectation as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 359 of 567\n\nto privacy may be significant, although, not necessarily\n\nconclusive factor’. This perhaps explains the apparent conflict as\n\nregards finger prints.\n\n290) In the leading case Katz v. US99 Reasonable Expectation was\n\nstated to embrace two distinct questions. The first was whether\n\nthe individual, by his conduct has exhibited an actual (subjective\n\nexpectation of privacy), and the second, whether the subjective\n\nexpectation is one that the society is prepared to recognize as\n\nreasonable. This was also followed in Smith v. Marlyand100.\n\n291) In the judgment of Court of Appeal in R. Wood v.\n\nCommissioner101, the appellant complained against taking and\n\nretention of his photograph in Central London in the context of a\n\nmeeting by the police force to enable identification at a later time\n\nin the event of eruption of disorder and commission of offence.\n\nThe concept of reasonable expectation was examined after\n\nsurveying a series of judgments which sought to consider\n\nviolation of\nArticle 8\nof the ECHR. The following pertinent\n\naspects emerge:\n\n(i) Whether information related to private or public matter?\n\n(ii) Whether the material obtained was envisaged for a limited\n\n99 389 U.S. 347\n100442 US 735\n101(2010) 1 WLR 123\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 360 of 567\n\nuse or was likely to be made available to general public?\n\n(iii) Private life was a broad term covering physical and\n\npsychological integrity of a person.\n\n(iv) Storing of data relating to private life of an individual\n\ninterferes with\nArticle 8.\nHowever, in determining whether\n\ninformation retained involves any private life aspect would have to\n\nbe determined with due regard to the specific context.\n\n(v)\nArticle 8\n, however protean, should not be so construed\n\nwidely that its claims become unreal and unreasonable. Firstly,\n\nthe threat to individuals personal autonomy must attain a certain\n\nlevel of seriousness. Secondly, the claimant must enjoy on the\n\nfacts a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thirdly, the breadth of\n\nArticle 8(1)\nmay in many instances be greatly curtailed by scope\n\nof justifications available to the State.\n\n(vi) Reasonable expectation of privacy is a broad concept which\n\ntakes into account all the circumstances of the case. They\n\ninclude attributes of the claimants, the nature of the activity in\n\nwhich the claimant was engaged, the place at which it was\n\nhappening, the nature and purpose of the intrusion, the absence\n\n(or presence) of consent, the effect on the claimant and the\n\npurpose for which information is taken.\n\n292) Therefore, when a claim of privacy seeks inclusion in\nArticle 21\nof\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 361 of 567\n\nthe Constitution of India, the Court needs to apply the reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy test. It should, inter alia, see:\n\n(i) What is the context in which a privacy claim is set up?\n\n(ii) Does the claim relate to private or family life, or a\n\nconfidential relationship?\n\n(iii) Is the claim a serious one or is it trivial?\n\n(iv) Is the disclosure likely to result in any serious or significant\n\ninjury and the nature and extent of disclosure?\n\n(v) Is disclosure relates to personal and sensitive information of\n\nan identified person?\n\n(vi) Does disclosure relate to information already disclosed\n\npublicly? If so, its implication?\n\n293) Under the Aadhaar Act Architecture, four types of information is to\n\nbe given at the time of enrolment:\n\n(i) Mandatory demographic information comprising name, date\n\nof birth, address and gender (\nSection 2(k)\nread with\nRegulation\n\n4(1)\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016).\n\n(ii) Optional demographic information (\nSection 2(k)\nread with\n\nRegulation 4(2)\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\nRegulations, 2016).\n\n(iii) Non core biometric information comprising photograph.\n\n(iv) Core biometric information comprising finger print and iris\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 362 of 567\n\nscan.\n\n294) Insofar as demographic information is concerned, it is required by\n\nthe provisions of many other enactments as well like Companies\n\nAct, Special Marriage Act, Central Motor Vehicle Rules,\n\nRegistration of Electoral Rules, The Citizenship Rules, The\n\nPassport Act and even Supreme Court Rules.\n\n295) As regards core biometric information which comprises finger\n\nprints, iris scan, for the purpose of enrolling in Aadhaar scheme,\n\nwe have already held earlier that it is minimal information\n\nrequired for enrolment. This information becomes essential for\n\nauthentication use in a public sphere and in relational context.\n\n296) It may also be mentioned that with the advent of science and\n\ntechnology, finger print and iris scan have been considered to be\n\nthe most accurate and non invasive mode of identifying an\n\nindividual. It is for this reason that these are taken also for driving\n\nlicenses, passports, visa as well as at the time of registration of\n\ndocuments by the State. These are also used in mobile phones,\n\nlaptops, lockers etc. for private use. International Civil Aviation\n\nOrganisation (ICAO) has recommended use of biometric\n\npassports. Many civilized countries with robust democratic\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 363 of 567\n\nregime have also introduced biometric based identity cards.\n\nTherefore, collection of information in the four different categories\n\nmentioned above may not be unreasonable. However, as stated\n\nearlier as well, the issue is not of taking the aforesaid information\n\nfor the purpose of enrolling in Aadhaar and for authentication. It\n\nis the storage and retention of this data, whenever authentication\n\ntakes place, about which the concerns are raised by the\n\npetitioners. The fears expressed by the petitioners are that with\n\nthe storage and retention of such data, profile of the persons can\n\nbe created which is susceptible to misuse.\n\n297) This aspect has already been dealt with earlier and apprehension\n\nof the petitioners are taken care of. To recapitulate, at the time of\n\nenrolment, the data collected is minimal and there is no data\n\ncollection in respect of religion, caste, tribe, language of records\n\nof entitlement income or medical history of the applicant at the\n\ntime of Aadhaar enrolment. Full care is taken that even the\n\nminimal data collected at the time of enrolment does not remain\n\nwith the enrolment agency and immediately gets transmitted to\n\nCIDR. Even at the time of authentication, the only exercise which\n\nis undertaken by the Authority is to see that the finger prints\n\nand/or iris scan of the concerned person sent for authentication\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 364 of 567\n\nmatch with the one which is in the system of Authority.\n\n298) Let us advert to the second facet of balancing, namely, balancing\n\nof two fundamental rights. As already pointed out above, the\n\nAadhaar Act truly seeks to secure to the poor and deprived\n\npersons an opportunity to live their life and exercise their liberty.\n\nBy ensuring targeted delivery through digital identification, it not\n\nonly provides them a nationally recognized identity but also\n\nattempts to ensure the delivery of benefits, service and subsidies\n\nwith the aid of public exchequer/Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nNational Security Food Act, 2013\npassed by the Parliament seeks\n\nto address the issue of food, security at the household level. The\n\nscheme of that Act is aimed at providing food grains to those\n\nbelonging to BPL categories.\nLike the MGNREGA Act, 2005\n\ntakes care of employment.\nThe MGNREGA Act\nhas been\n\nenacted for the enhancement, livelihood, security of the\n\nhouseholds in rural areas of the country. It guarantees at least\n\n100 days of wage employment in every financial year to at least\n\none able member of every household in the rural area on assets\n\ncreating public work programme.\nSections 3\nand\nof the\n\nMGNREGA Act contain this guarantee. The minimum facilities to\n\nbe provided are set out by\nSection 5\nread with Schedule II.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 365 of 567\n\nSection 22\nprovides for funding pattern and\nSection 23\nprovides\n\nfor transparency and accountability.\nThis Act\nis another instance\n\nof a rights based approach and it enlivens the Fundamental Right\n\nto life and personal liberty of Below Poverty Line people in rural\n\nareas.\n\n299) We may mention here that Mr. Dwivedi had pointed out not only\n\nIndia but several other countries including western nations which\n\nhave read socio-economic rights into human dignity and right to\n\nlife. Hungary and South Africa have gone to the extent of making\n\nexpress provisions in their Constitutions.\n\nThe Federal Constitution Court of Germany in a decision\n\ndated February 09, 2010 while deciding the question whether the\n\namount of standard benefit aid is compatible with the Basic Law\n\nheld that:\n\n“The Fundamental Right to the guarantee of a subsistence\nminimum is in line with human dignity emerges from\nArticle\n1.1\nof the Basic Law in conjunction with\nArticle 20.1\nof the\nBasic Law…\nArticle 1.1\nof the Basic Law established this\nclaim. The principle of the social welfare State contained in\n\nArticle 20.1\nof the Basic Law, in turn grants to the\nLegislature the mandate to ensure a subsistence minimum\nfor all that is in line with human dignity”.\n\nIt is further held that:\n\n“if a person does not have the material means to guarantee\nan existence that is in line with human dignity because he\nor she is unable to obtain it either out of his or her gainful\nemployment, or from own property or by benefits from third\nparties, the State is obliged within its mandate to protect\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 366 of 567\n\nhuman dignity and to ensure, in the implementation of its\nsocial welfare state mandate, that the material\nprerequisites for this are at the disposal of the person in\nneed of assistance.”\n\nSimilarly, in a latter judgment dated July 18, 2012 while\n\ndeciding whether the amount of the cash benefit provided for in\n\nthe Asylum Seekers Benefits Act was constitutional it reiterated\n\nthat:\n\n“the direct constitutional benefit claim to the guarantee of a\ndignified minimum existence does only cover those means\nthat are absolutely necessary to maintain a dignified life. It\nguarantees the entire minimum existence as a\ncomprehensive fundamental rights guarantee, that\nencompasses both humans’ physical existence, that is\nfood, clothing, household items, housing, heating, hygiene,\nand health, and guarantees the possibility maintain\ninterpersonal relationships and a minimal degree of\nparticipation in social, cultural and political life, since a\nhuman as a person necessarily exists in a social context..”\n\n300) The Constitutional Court of South Africa in Government of the\n\nRepublic of South Africa & Ors. v. Grootboom102 held that:\n\n“...these rights need to be considered in the context of the\nsocio-economic rights enshrined in the Constitution. They\nentrench the right to access to land, to adequate housing\nand to health care, food, water and social security..”\n\n301) In 1995, Hungary’s Constitutional Court ruled that the right to\n\nsocial security as contained in Article 70/E of the Constitution\n\nobligated the State to secure a minimum livelihood through all of\n\nthe welfare benefits necessary for the realization of the right to\n102(2000) ZACC 19\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 367 of 567\n\nhuman dignity.\n\n302) Even in Italy, the Courts have emphasized on the right to social\n\nsecurity.\n\n303) In Budina v. Russia103, the European Court of Human Rights has\n\nrecognized, in principle, that inadequate benefits could fall under\n\nArticle 3\nof the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)\n\non the right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment.\n\n304) In 1996, the Swiss Federal Court ruled that three Czechs illegally\n\nresiding in Switzerland are entitled to social benefit in order to\n\nhave a minimal level of subsistence for a life in dignity to prevent\n\na situation where people “are reduced to beggars, a condition\n\nunworthy of being called human. It held:\n\n“...The federal constitution does not (though the 1995 draft\nnew constitution is now different) explicitly provide for a\nfundamental right to a subsistence guarantee. One can\nhowever also derive unwritten constitutional right from it. A\nguarantee of freedoms not mentioned in the constitution by\nunwritten constitutional law was assumed by the exercise\nof other freedoms (mentioned in the constitution), or\notherwise evidently indispensable components of the\ndemocratic constitutional order of the Federation...”\n\n“...The guaranteeing of elementary human needs like food,\nclothing and shelter is the condition for human existence\nand development as such. It is at the same time an\nindispensable component of a constitutional, democratic\npolity.”\n\n103 App. No. 45603/05 decided on 18.06.2009\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 368 of 567\n\n305) Nelson Mandela in his speech at Trafalgar Square in London in\n\n2005 said:\n\n“...Massive poverty and obscene inequality are such\nterrible scourges of our times – times in which the world\nboasts breathtaking advances in science, technology,\nindustry and wealth accumulation – that they have to rank\nalongside slavery and apartheid as social evils...And\novercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. It is an act\nof justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right,\nthe right to dignity and a decent life. While poverty\npersists, there is no true freedom.”\n\n306) Following passages by James Griffin in his book on “Human\n\nRights” are worth noting :\n\n“10.1 THE HISTORICAL GROWTH OF RIGHTS:\n\nContrary to widespread belief, welfare rights are not a\ntwentieth-century innovation, but are among the first\nhuman rights ever to be claimed. When in the twelfth and\nthirteenth centuries our modern conception of a right first\nappeared, one of the earliest examples offered was the\nright of those in dire need to receive aid from those in\nsurplus. This right was used to articulate the attractive\nview of property prevalent in the medieval Church. God\nhas given all things to us in common, but as goods will not\nbe cared for and usefully developed unless assigned to\nparticular individuals, we creatures have instituted systems\nof property. In these systems, however, an owner is no\nmore than a custodian. We all thus have a right, if we\nshould fall into great need, to receive necessary goods or,\nfailing that, to take them from those in surplus.\n\nOne finds, every occasionally, what seem to be human\nrights to welfare asserted in the Enlightenment, for\nexample, by John Locke, Tom Paine, and William Cobbett.\nFollowing the Enlightenment, right to welfare have often\nappeared in national constitutions; for example, the French\nconstitutions of the 1790s, the Prussian Civil Code (1794),\nthe Constitutions of Sweden (1809), Norway (1814), The\nNetherlands (1814), Denmark (1849), and, skipping to the\ntwentieth century, the Soviet Union (1936)-though it is not\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 369 of 567\n\nalways clear that the drafters of these various documents\nthought of these fundamental civil rights as also human\nrights. By the end of the nineteenth century, political\ntheorists were beginning to make a case that welfare rights\nare basic in much the sense that Civil and political rights\nare. But it was Franklin Roosevelt who did most to bring\nwelfare rights into public life. The Atlantic Charter (1941),\nsigned by Roosevelt and Churchill but in this respect\nprimarily Roosevelt’s initiative, declared that in addition to\nthe classical civil and political freedoms here were also\nfreedoms from want and fear. In his State of the Union\nmessage of 1944, Roosevelt averred :\n\nWe have come to a clear realization of the fact that true\nindividual freedom cannot exist without economic security\nand independence. ‘Necessitous men are not free men’…\n\nIn our day these economic truths have become accepted\nas self evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second\nBill of Rights…\nAmong these are : The right to a useful and remunerative\njob…. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food\nand clothing and recreation…\nThe United Nations committee charged with drafting the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), chaired by\nEleanor Roosevelt, included most of the now standard\nwelfare rights; rights to social security, to work, to rest and\nleisure, to medical care, to education, and ‘to enjoy the arts\nand to share in scientific advancements and its benefits’.\nThe Universal Declaration is a good example of how\nextensive-some would say lavish-proposed welfare rights\nhave become.\n\n...If human rights are protections of a form of life that is\nautonomous and free, they should protect life as well as\nthat form of it. But if they protect life, must they not also\nensure the wherewithal to keep body and soul together-\nthat is, some minimum material provision? And as mere\nsubsistence-that is, keeping body and soul together-is too\nmeager to ensure normative agency, must not human\nrights guarantee also whatever leisure and education and\naccess to the thought of others that are also necessary to\nbeing a normative agent?\n\nThat is the heart of the case. It appeals to our picture of\nhuman agency and argues that both life and certain\nsupporting goods are integral to it. Life and certain\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 370 of 567\n\nsupporting goods are necessary conditions of being\nautonomous and free. Many philosophers employ this\nnecessary – condition argument to establish a human right\nto welfare-or, at least, to establish the right’s being as basic\nas any other rights.\n\nI too want to invoke the necessary-conditions arguments; I\nshould only want to strengthen it. It is now common to say\nthat liberty rights and welfare rights are ‘indivisible’. But\nthat, also, is too weak. It asserts that one cannot enjoy the\nbenefits of liberty rights without enjoying the benefits of\nwelfare rights, and vice versa. But something stronger still\nmay be said. There are forms of welfare that are\nempirically necessary conditions of a person’s being\nautonomous and free, but there are also forms that are\nlogically necessary-part of what we mean in saying that a\nperson has these rights. The value in which human rights\nare grounded is the value attaching to normative agency.\nThe norm arising from this value, of course, prohibits\npersons from attacking another’s autonomy and liberty.\nBut it prohibits more. The value concerned is being a\nnormative agent, a self-creator, made in god’s image….\nThe value resides not simply in one’s having the\nundeveloped, unused capacities for autonomy and liberty\nbut also in exercising them-not just in being able to be\nautonomous but also in actually being so. The norm\nassociated with this more complex value would address\nother ways of failing to be an agent. It would require\nprotecting another person from losing agency, at least if\none can do this without great cost to oneself; it would\nrequire helping to restore another’s agency if it has already\nbeen lost, say through giving mobility to the crippled or\nguidance to the blind, again with the same proviso. All of\nthis is involved simply in having a right to autonomy or to\nliberty. Welfare claims are already part of the content of\nthese rights. What, then, should we think of the common\ndivision of basic rights into ‘classical’ liberty rights and\nwelfare rights? Into which of these two classes does the\nright to autonomy or to liberty go? Into which of the two\nclasses do the difficult, apparently borderline cases go,\nsuch as rights to life, to property, to the pursuit of\nhappiness, to security of person, and to privacy? The\nsensible response would be to drop the distinction. What is\nmore, a right to welfare is a human right.\n\n36. Amartya Sen in his book “Development as Freedom”\nsays:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 371 of 567\n\nDevelopment requires the removal of major sources\nof unfreedom: poverty as well as tyranny, poor economic\nopportunities as well as systematic social deprivation,\nneglect of public facilities as well as intolerance or\noveractivity of repressive states. Despite unprecedented\nincreases in overall opulence, the contemporary world\ndenies elementary freedoms to vast numbers-perhaps\neven the majority-of people. Sometimes the lack of\nsubstantive freedoms relates directly to economic poverty,\nwhich robs people of the freedom to satisfy hunger, or to\nachieve sufficient nutrition, or to obtain remedies for\ntreatable illnesses, or the opportunity to be adequately\nclothed or sheltered, or to enjoy clean water or sanitary\nfacilities. In other cases, the unfreedom links closely to the\nlack of public facilities and social care, such as the\nabsence of epidemiological programs, or of organized\narrangements for health care or educational facilities, or of\neffective institutions for the maintenance of local peace and\norder. In still other cases, the violation of freedom results\ndirectly from a denial of political and civil liberties by\nauthoritarian regimes and from imposed restrictions on the\nfreedom to participate in the social, political and economic\nlife of the community.”\n\n307) In the aforesaid backdrop, this Court is called upon to find out\n\nwhether Aadhaar Act strikes a fair balance between the two\n\nrights. In this context, we have to examine the importance of\n\nachieving the proper purpose and the social importance of\n\npreventing the limitation on the constitutional rights. Insofar as\n\nimportance of achieving the proper purpose is concerned, that\n\nhas already been highlighted above. To reiterate some of the\n\nimportant features, it is to be borne in mind that the State is using\n\nAadhaar as an enabler for providing deserving section of the\n\nsociety their right to food, right to livelihood, right to receive\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 372 of 567\n\npension and other social assistance benefits like scholarships\n\netc. thereby bringing their right to life to fruition. This necessity of\n\nAadhaar has arisen in order to ensure that such benefits are\n\ngiven to only genuine beneficiaries.\nThe Act\naims at efficient,\n\ntransparent and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices. In the process, it wants to achieve the objective of\n\nchecking the corrupt practices at various levels of distribution\n\nsystem which deprive genuine persons from receiving these\n\nbenefits. There have been reports relating to leakages in PDS as\n\nwell as in fuel subsidies and also in working of MGNREGA\n\nscheme. Mr. Venugopal, learned Attorney General has given the\n\nfollowing details about these reports:\n\n(I) Reports relating to leakages in PDS\n\nSeveral studies initiated by the Government as well\nas the World Bank and Planning Commission revealed that\nfood grains did not reach the intended beneficiaries and\nthat there was large scale leakages due to the failure to\nestablish identity:\n\n(a) The Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its\nAudit Report No. 3 of 2000 in its overview for the Audit\nReport observed that the Public Distribution Scheme\nsuffered from serious targeting problems. 1.93 Crore\nbogus ration cards were found to be in circulation in 13\nStates and a significant portion of the subsidized food-\n\ngrains and other essential commodities did not reach the\nbeneficiaries due to their diversion in the open market.\n\n(b) A Report titled “Budget Briefs: Targeted Public\nDistribution System (TPDS), GOI 2011-2012” prepared by\nAvani Kapur and Anirvan Chowdhury and published by the\nAccountability Initiative observed that there were large\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 373 of 567\n\nnumber of fake ration cards which were causing\ninefficiencies in targeting. Between July 2006 and July\n2010, in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and\nOrissa, total of 37 lakh ineligible/fake ration cards for\nhouseholds have been eliminated. Additionally, in\nMaharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, 29 lakh and 25 lakh\nineligible ration cards were discovered and cancelled.\n\n(c) World Bank published a Discussion Paper No. 380\ntitled “India’s Public Distribution System: A National and\nInternational Perspective” dated November, 1997 co-\nauthored by R. Radhakrishna and K. Subbarao, in which it\nwas found that in the year in 1986-87 for every one rupee\n(Re. 1) transferred under the PDS, the expenditure\nincurred by the central government was Rs. 4.27.\n\n(d) The Planning Commission of India in its\nPerformance Evaluation Report titled “Performance\nEvaluation Report of Targeted Public Distribution System\n(TPDS)” dated March, 2005 found as follows:\n\n(i) State-wise figure of excess Ration Cards in various\nstates and the existence of over 1.52 Crore excess Ration\nCards issued.\n\n(ii) Existence of fictitious households and identification\nerrors leading to exclusion of genuine beneficiaries.\n\n(iii) Leakage through ghost BPL Ration Cards found to\nbe prevalent in almost all the states under study.\n\n(iv) The Leakage of food grains through ghost cards has\nbeen tabulated and the percentage of such leakage on an\nAll India basis has been estimated at 16.67%.\n\n(v) It is concluded that a large part of the subsidized\nfood-grains were not reaching the target group.\n\n(II) Report relating to Fuel subsidies\n\n13. With respect of Kerosene subsidies:\n\n(a) A Report titled “Budgetary Subsidies in India –\nSubsidizing Social and Economic Services” prepared by\nthe National Institute of Public Finance and Policy dated\nMarch, found that the key to lowering volume of subsidies\nwas better targeting without which, there was significant\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 374 of 567\n\nleakage to unintended beneficiaries, with only 70% of the\nkerosene reaching the poorer section of society.\n\n(b) The Economic Survey 2014-15 at Chapter 3 titled\n“Wiping Every Tear from every Eye: The JAM Number\nTrinity Solution” dated February, 2015 noted that only 59\npercent of subsidized kerosene allocated via the PDS is\nactually consumed by households, with the remainder lost\nto leakage and only 46 percent of total consumption is by\npoor households.\n\n14. With respect to the MGNREGA Scheme the following\nreports have found large scale leakages in the scheme:\n\n(a) Report prepared by the V.V. Giri National Labour\nInstitute and sponsored by the Department of Rural\nDevelopment, Ministry of Rural Development, Government\nof India as “The study of Schedule of Rates for National\nRural Employment Guarantee Scheme” observes that\nthere was great fraud in making fake job cards and it was\nfound that in many cases, it was found that workers\nperformed one day’s job, but their attendance was put for\n33 days. The workers got money for one day while wages\nfor 32 days were misappropriated by the people associated\nwith the functioning of NREGS.\n\n(b) The National Institute of Public Finance and Policy’s\nreport titled as “A Cost-benefit analysis of Aadhaar” dated\n09.11.2012 estimated that a leakage of approximately 12\npercent is being caused to the government on account of\nghost workers and manipulated muster rolls and assumed\nthat 5 percent of the leakages can be plugged through\nwage disbursement using Aadhaar-enabled bank accounts\nand 7 percent through automation of muster rolls.\n\n(III) It was also pointed out that the Thirteenth Finance\nCommission Report for 2010-2015 dated December, 2009\nat page 218 in “Chapter 12 – Grants in Aid” states that the\ncreation of a biometric-based unique identity for all\nresidents in the country has the potential to address need\nof the government to ensure that only eligible persons are\nprovided subsidies and benefits and that all eligible\npersons are covered.\n\nThe relevant findings of the above Report are as\nfollows:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 375 of 567\n\n(i) Government of India’s expenditure on subsidies is\nexpected to be about Rs.1,11,000 Crore in 2009-10, or\nnearly 18 per cent of the non-plan revenue expenditure.\n\n(ii) The data base of eligible persons presently\nmaintained has both Type I (exclusion) and Type II\n(inclusion) errors. The first error arises from the difficulty\nfaced by the poor in establishing their identity in order to be\neligible for government subsidies and social safety net\nprogrammes. The second error arises because of the\ninability to cross-verify lists of eligible persons across\ndistrict-level and state-level data bases to eliminate\nduplicate and ghost entries. We need to ensure that only\neligible persons are provided subsidies and benefits and\nthat all eligible persons are covered.\n\n(iii) Creation of a biometric-based unique identity for all\nresidents in the country has the potential to address both\nthese dimensions simultaneously. It will provide the basis\nfor focusing subsidies to target groups. Possession of\nsuch an identity will also enable the poor and\nunderprivileged to leverage other resources like bank\naccounts, cell phones, which can empower them and\ncatalyse their income growth. These benefits cannot be\naccessed by them presently due to their inability to provide\nacceptable identification. The initiative to provide unique\nIDs has the potential to significantly improve the\ngovernance and delivery framework of public services\nwhile substantially reducing transaction costs, leakages\nand frauds.\n\n308) As against the above larger public interest, the invasion into the\n\nprivacy rights of these beneficiaries is minimal. By no means it\n\ncan be said that it has disproportionate effect on the right holder.\n\n309) Intensity of review depends upon the particular context of\n\nquestion in a given case. There is yet another significant angle in\n\nthese matters, which has to be emphasised at this stage viz.\n\ndignity in the form of autonomy (informational privacy) and dignity\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 376 of 567\n\nin the form of assuring better living standards, of the same\n\nindividual. In the instant case, a holistic view of the matter,\n\nhaving regard to the detailed discussion hereinabove, would\n\namply demonstrate that enrolment in Aadhaar of the unprivileged\n\nand marginalised section of the society, in order to avail the fruits\n\nof welfare schemes of the Government, actually amounts to\n\nempowering these persons. On the one hand, it gives such\n\nindividuals their unique identity and, on the other hand, it also\n\nenables such individuals to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of\n\nthe Government which are floated as socio-economic welfare\n\nmeasures to uplift such classes. In that sense, the scheme\n\nensures dignity to such individuals. This facet of dignity cannot\n\nbe lost sight of and needs to be acknowledged. We are, by no\n\nmeans, accepting that when dignity in the form of economic\n\nwelfare is given, the State is entitled to rob that person of his\n\nliberty. That can never be allowed. We are concerned with the\n\nbalancing of the two facets of dignity. Here we find that the\n\ninroads into the privacy rights where these individuals are made\n\nto part with their biometric information, is minimal. It is coupled\n\nwith the fact that there is no data collection on the movements of\n\nsuch individuals, when they avail benefits under\nSection 7\nof the\n\nAct thereby ruling out the possibility of creating their profiles. In\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 377 of 567\n\nfact, this technology becomes a vital tool of ensuring good\n\ngovernance in a social welfare state. We, therefore, are of the\n\nopinion that the Aadhaar Act meets the test of balancing as well.\n\n310) We may profitably refer to the judgment of this Court in People’s\n\nUnion for\nCivil Liberties (PUCL) & Anr. v. Union of India & Anr.104\n\nwhich dealt with the issue of right to privacy vis-a-vis in public\n\ninterest and leaned in favour of public interest which can be seen\n\nfrom the following discussion:\n\n“121. It has been contended with much force that the right\nto information made available to the voters/citizens by\njudicial interpretation has to be balanced with the right of\nprivacy of the spouse of the contesting candidate and any\ninsistence on the disclosure of assets and liabilities of the\nspouse invades his/her right to privacy which is implied in\n\nArticle 21.\nAfter giving anxious consideration to this\nargument, I am unable to uphold the same.\nIn this context,\nI would like to recall the apt words of Mathew, J., in\nGobind\nv. State of M.P.\n[1969 UJ (SC) 616] While analysing the\nright to privacy as an ingredient of\nArticle 21\n, it was\nobserved: (SCC p. 155, para 22)\n\n“22. There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims\ndeserve to be examined with care and to be denied\nonly when an important countervailing interest is\nshown to be superior.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\nIt was then said succinctly: (SCC pp. 155-56, para\n\n22)\n\n“If the court does find that a claimed right is entitled to\nprotection as a fundamental privacy right, a law\ninfringing it must satisfy the compelling State-interest\ntest. Then the question would be whether a State\n\n104(2003) 4 SCC 399\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 378 of 567\n\ninterest is of such paramount importance as would\njustify an infringement of the right.”\n\nIt was further explained: (SCC p. 156, para 23)\n\n“[P]rivacy primarily concerns the individual. It\ntherefore relates to and overlaps with the concept of\nliberty. The most serious advocate of privacy must\nconfess that there are serious problems of defining\nthe essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the context of other\nrights and values.”\n\nBy calling upon the contesting candidate to disclose\nthe assets and liabilities of his/her spouse, the\nfundamental right to information of a voter/citizen is\nthereby promoted. When there is a competition\nbetween the right to privacy of an individual and the\nright to information of the citizens, the former right\nhas to be subordinated to the latter right as it serves\nthe larger public interest. The right to know about the\ncandidate who intends to become a public figure and\na representative of the people would not be effective\nand real if only truncated information of the assets\nand liabilities is given. It cannot be denied that the\nfamily relationship and social order in our country is\nsuch that the husband and wife look to the properties\nheld by them as belonging to the family for all\npractical purposes, though in the eye of law the\nproperties may distinctly belong to each of them. By\nand large, there exists a sort of unity of interest in the\nproperties held by spouses. The property being kept\nin the name of the spouse benami is not unknown in\nour country. In this situation, it could be said that a\ncountervailing or paramount interest is involved in\nrequiring a candidate who chooses to subject\nhimself/herself to public gaze and scrutiny to furnish\nthe details of assets and liabilities of the spouse as\nwell. That is one way of looking at the problem. More\nimportant, it is to be noted that Parliament itself\naccepted in principle that not only the assets of the\nelected candidates but also his or her spouse and\ndependent children should be disclosed to the\nconstitutional authority and the right of privacy should\nnot come in the way of such disclosure;...”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 379 of 567\n\n311) In Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton et ux., Guardians Ad\n\nLitem for Acton105, the Supreme Court of United States, while\n\nrepelling the Fourth Amendment challenge wherein the petitioner\n\nhad adopted a Drug Policy which authorised random urinalysis\n\ndrug testing of students participating in athletics programs,\n\nremarked as under:\n\n“Taking into account all the factors we have considered\nabove- the decreased expectation of privacy, the relative\nunobtrusiveness of the search, and the severity of the need\nmet by the search-we conclude Vernonia’s Policy is\nreasonable and hence constitutional.”\n\n312) This very exercise of balancing of two fundamental rights was\n\nalso carried out in\nSubramanian Swamy v. Union of India,\n\nMinistry of Law & Ors.106\nwhere the Court dealt with the matter in\n\nthe following manner:\n\n“122.\nIn\nState of Madras v. V.G. Row [State of Madras\nv.\nV.G. Row, AIR 1952 SC 196 : 1952 Cri LJ 966], the Court\nhas ruled that the test of reasonableness, wherever\nprescribed, should be applied to each individual statute\nimpugned and no abstract standard, or general pattern of\nreasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all\ncases. The nature of the right alleged to have been\ninfringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions\nimposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be\nremedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the\nprevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the\njudicial verdict.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n105515 US 646 (1995)\n106(2016) 7 SCC 221\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 380 of 567\n\n130. The principles as regards reasonable restriction as\nhas been stated by this Court from time to time are that the\nrestriction should not be excessive and in public interest.\n\nThe legislation should not invade the rights and should not\nsmack of arbitrariness. The test of reasonableness cannot\nbe determined by laying down any abstract standard or\ngeneral pattern. It would depend upon the nature of the\nright which has been infringed or sought to be infringed.\nThe ultimate “impact”, that is, effect on the right has to be\ndetermined. The “impact doctrine” or the principle of\n“inevitable effect” or “inevitable consequence” stands in\ncontradistinction to abuse or misuse of a legislation or a\nstatutory provision depending upon the circumstances of\nthe case. The prevailing conditions of the time and the\nprinciples of proportionality of restraint are to be kept in\nmind by the court while adjudging the constitutionality of a\nprovision regard being had to the nature of the right. The\nnature of social control which includes public interest has a\nrole. The conception of social interest has to be borne in\nmind while considering reasonableness of the restriction\nimposed on a right. The social interest principle would\ninclude the felt needs of the society.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nBalancing of fundamental rights\n\n136. To appreciate what we have posed hereinabove, it is\nnecessary to dwell upon balancing the fundamental rights.\nIt has been argued by the learned counsel for the\npetitioners that the right conferred under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n\nhas to be kept at a different pedestal than the individual\nreputation which has been recognised as an aspect of\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. In fact the submission is that\nright to freedom of speech and expression which includes\nfreedom of press should be given higher status and the\nindividual's right to have his/her reputation should yield to\nthe said right.\nIn this regard a passage from\nSakal Papers\n(P) Ltd. [Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India\n, (1962) 3\nSCR 842 : AIR 1962 SC 305] has been commended to us.\nIt says: (AIR pp. 313-14, para 36)\n\n“36. … Freedom of speech can be restricted only in\nthe interests of the security of the State, friendly\nrelations with foreign State, public order, decency or\nmorality or in relation to contempt of court,\ndefamation or incitement to an offence. It cannot, like\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 381 of 567\n\nthe freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in the\ninterest of the general public. If a law directly affecting\nit is challenged, it is no answer that the restrictions\nenacted by it are justifiable under clauses (3) to (6).\nFor, the scheme of\nArticle 19\nis to enumerate different\nfreedoms separately and then to specify the extent of\nrestrictions to which they may be subjected and the\nobjects for securing which this could be done. A\ncitizen is entitled to enjoy each and every one of the\nfreedoms together and clause (1) does not prefer one\nfreedom to another. That is the plain meaning of this\nclause. It follows from this that the State cannot make\na law which directly restricts one freedom even for\nsecuring the better enjoyment of another freedom.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n137. Having bestowed our anxious consideration on the\nsaid passage, we are disposed to think that the above\npassage is of no assistance to the petitioners, for the issue\nherein is sustenance and balancing of the separate rights,\none under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand the other, under\nArticle 21.\n\nHence, the concept of equipoise and counterweighing\nfundamental rights of one with other person. It is not a case\nof mere better enjoyment of another freedom. In Acharya\nMaharajshri Narendra Prasadji Anandprasadji Maharaj v.\nState of Gujarat [Acharya Maharajshri Narendra Prasadji\nAnandprasadji Maharaj v. State of Gujarat, (1975) 1 SCC\n11], it has been observed that a particular fundamental\nright cannot exist in isolation in a watertight compartment.\nOne fundamental right of a person may have to coexist in\nharmony with the exercise of another fundamental right by\nothers and also with reasonable and valid exercise of\npower by the State in the light of the directive principles in\nthe interests of social welfare as a whole. The Court's duty\nis to strike a balance between competing claims of different\ninterests…\n\nxx xx xx\n\n194. Needless to emphasise that when a law limits a\nconstitutional right which many laws do, such limitation is\nconstitutional if it is proportional. The law imposing\nrestriction is proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper\npurpose, and if the measures taken to achieve such a\npurpose are rationally connected to the purpose, and such\nmeasures are necessary. Such limitations should not be\narbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 382 of 567\n\nin the interest of the public. Reasonableness is judged with\nreference to the objective which the legislation seeks to\nachieve, and must not be in excess of that objective (see\n\nP.P. Enterprises v. Union of India [P.P. Enterprises\nv. Union\nof India, (1982) 2 SCC 33 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 341]).\nFurther,\nthe reasonableness is examined in an objective manner\nfrom the standpoint of the interest of the general public and\nnot from the point of view of the person upon whom the\nrestrictions are imposed or abstract considerations (see\nMohd. Hanif Quareshi v. State of Bihar [Mohd. Hanif\nQuareshi v. State of Bihar, AIR 1958 SC 731]).”\n\n313) Thus, even when two aspects of the fundamental rights of the\n\nsame individual, which appear to be in conflict with each other, is\n\ndone, we find that the Aadhaar Act has struck a fair balance\n\nbetween the right of privacy of the individual with right to life of\n\nthe same individual as a beneficiary.\n\nIn the face of the all pervading prescript for accomplished\n\nsocio-economic rights, that need to be given to the deprived and\n\nmarginalised section of the society, as the constitutional\n\nimperative embodied in these provisions of the Act, it is entitled to\n\nreceive judicial imprimatur.\n\nRe : Argument on Exclusion:\n\n314) Some incidental aspects, however, remain to be discussed. It\n\nwas argued by the petitioners that the entire authentication\n\nprocess is probabilistic in nature inasmuch as case of a genuine\n\nperson for authentication can result in rejection as biometric\n\ntechnology does not guarantee 100% accuracy. It may happen\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 383 of 567\n\nfor various reasons, namely, advance age, damage to fingerprints\n\ndue to accident, etc. Even in case of children the fingerprints\n\nmay change when they grow up. The emphasis was that there\n\nwas a possibility of failure in authentication for various reasons\n\nand when it happens it would result in the exclusion rather than\n\ninclusion. In such eventuality an individual would not only be\n\ndenied the benefits of welfare schemes, it may threaten his very\n\nidentity and existence as well and it would be violative of\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution. The Authority has claimed that\n\nbiometric accuracy is 99.76%. It was, however, submitted that\n\nwhere more than 110 crores of persons have enrolled\n\nthemselves, even 0.232% failure would be a phenomenal figure,\n\nwhich comes to 27.60 lakh people. Therefore, the rate of\n\nexclusion is alarming and this would result in depriving needy\n\npersons to enjoy their fundamental rights, which is the so-called\n\nlaudable objective trumpeted by the respondents.\n\nTO DICTATE FURTHER\n\nRe. : Studies on exclusion\n\nRe. : Finger prints of disabled, old persons etc. See other\n\nmode of identity\n\n315) The aforesaid apprehensions are sought to be assuaged by the\n\nrespondents by submitting that\nSection 7\nof the Act nowhere says\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 384 of 567\n\nthat if authentication fails, the concerned person would be\n\ndeprived of subsidies, benefits or services. It is only an enabling\n\nprovision. It also provides that in case of such a failure, such an\n\nindividual would be permitted to establish her identity by any\n\nother means so that genuine persons are not deprived of their\n\nbenefits which are mentioned in\nSection 7\nas the entire Act is to\n\nfacilitate delivery of those benefits to such persons. Learned\n\nAttorney General also referred to the Circular dated October 24,\n\n2017 in this behalf which is issued by the Authority. That,\n\naccording to us, takes care of the problem.\n\n316) We understand and appreciate that execution of the Aadhaar\n\nscheme, which has otherwise a laudable objective, is a ‘work in\n\nprogress’. There have been substantial improvements in the\n\nsystem over a period of time from the date of its launch. It was\n\nstated by the learned Attorney General as well as Mr. Rakesh\n\nDwivedi, at the Bar, that whenever difficulties in implementation\n\nare brought to the notice of the respondents, remedial measures\n\nare taken with promptness. Cases of denial of services are\n\nspecifically looked into which is very much needed in a welfare\n\nState and there can be a genuine hope that with the fine tuning of\n\ntechnology, i.e. the mode of advancement at rapid pace, such\n\nproblems and concerns shall also be completely taken care of.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 385 of 567\n\n317) In fairness to the petitioners, it is worth mentioning that they have\n\nreferred to the research carried out by some individuals and even\n\nNGOs which have been relied upon to demonstrate that there are\n\nnumber of instances leading to the exclusion i.e. the benefits are\n\nallegedly denied on the ground of failure of authentication. The\n\nrespondents have refuted such studies. These become disputed\n\nquestion of facts. It will be difficult to invalidate provisions of\n\nParliamentary legislations on the basis of such material, more\n\nparticularly, when their credence has not been tested.\n\n318) That apart, there is another significant and more important aspect\n\nwhich needs to be highlighted. The objective of the Act is to plug\n\nthe leakages and ensure that fruits of welfare schemes reach the\n\ntargeted population, for whom such schemes are actually meant.\n\nThis is the larger purpose, and very important public purpose,\n\nwhich the Act is supposed to subserve. We have already held\n\nthat it fulfills legitimate aim and there is a rational connection\n\nbetween the provisions of the Act and the goals which it seeks to\n\nattain.\nThe Act\npasses the muster of necessity stage as well\n\nwhen we do not find any less restrictive measure which could be\n\nequally effective in achieving the aim. In a situation like this\n\nwhere the Act is aimed at achieving the aforesaid public purpose,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 386 of 567\n\nstriving to benefit millions of deserving people, can it be\n\ninvalidated only on the ground that there is a possibility of\n\nexclusion of some of the seekers of these welfare schemes?\n\nAnswer has to be in the negative. We may hasten to add that by\n\nno means, we are accepting that if such an exclusion takes place,\n\nit is justified. We are only highlighting the fact that the\n\nGovernment seems to be sincere in its efforts to ensure that no\n\nsuch exclusion takes place and in those cases where an\n\nindividual who is rightfully entitled to benefits under the scheme is\n\nnot denied such a benefit merely because of failure of\n\nauthentication. In this scenario, the entire Aadhaar project cannot\n\nbe shelved. If that is done, it would cause much more harm to the\n\nsociety.\n\n319) We are also conscious of the situation where the formation of\n\nfingerprints may undergo change for various reasons. It may\n\nhappen in the case of a child after she grows up; it may happen\n\nin the case of an individual who gets old; it may also happen\n\nbecause of damage to the fingers as a result of accident or some\n\ndisease etc. or because of suffering of some kind of disability for\n\nwhatever reason. Even iris test can fail due to certain reasons\n\nincluding blindness of a person. We again emphasise that no\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 387 of 567\n\nperson rightfully entitled to the benefits shall be denied the same\n\non such grounds. It would be appropriate if a suitable provision\n\nbe made in the concerned regulations for establishing an identity\n\nby alternate means, in such situations. Furthermore, if there is a\n\n0.232% failure in authentication, it also cannot be said that all\n\nthese failures were only in those cases where authentication was\n\nfor the purpose of utilising for the benefit of the welfare schemes,\n\ni.e. with reference to\nSection 7\nof the Act. It could have\n\nhappened in other cases as well. Be as it may, there is yet\n\nanother angle which has to be kept in mind and cannot be\n\nignored. We have already highlighted above as to how the\n\nAadhaar project is aimed at serving a much larger public interest.\n\nThe Authority has claimed that biometric accuracy is 99.76% and\n\nthe petitioners have also proceeded on that basis. In this\n\nscenario, if the Aadhaar project is shelved, 99.76% beneficiaries\n\nare going to suffer. Would it not lead to their exclusion? It will\n\namount to throwing the baby out of hot water along with the\n\nwater. In the name of 0.232% failure (which can in any case be\n\nremedied) should be revert to the pre-Aadhaar stage with a\n\nsystem of leakages, pilferages and corruption in the\n\nimplementation of welfare schemes meant for marginalised\n\nsection of the society, the full fruits thereof were not reaching to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 388 of 567\n\nsuch people? The Aadhaar programme was conceived and\n\nconceptualised by Mr. Nandan Nilekani under the leadership of\n\nthen Prime Minister, a great economist himself. It went through\n\nrigorous process of testing about its effectiveness before it is\n\nlaunched. This has been stated in the beginning. The entire aim\n\nbehind launching this programme is the ‘inclusion’ of the\n\ndeserving persons who need to get such benefits. When it is\n\nserving much larger purpose by reaching hundreds of millions of\n\ndeserving persons, it cannot be crucified on the unproven plea of\n\nexclusion of some. We again repeat that the Court is not\n\ntrivialising the problem of exclusion if it is there. However, what\n\nwe are emphasising is that remedy is to plug the loopholes rather\n\nthan axe a project, aimed for the welfare of large section of the\n\nsociety. Obviously, in order to address the failures of\n\nauthentication, the remedy is to adopt alternate methods for\n\nidentifying such persons, after finding the causes of failure in their\n\ncases. We have chosen this path which leads to better\n\nequilibrium and have given necessary directions also in this\n\nbehalf.\n\n320) Another facet which needs examination at this stage is the\n\nmeaning that is to be assigned to the expression ‘benefits’\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 389 of 567\n\noccurring in Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, along with ‘subsidies’\n\nand ‘services’. It was argued that the expression ‘benefits’ is very\n\nlose and wide and the respondents may attempt to bring within its\n\nsweep any and every kind of governmental activity in the name of\n\nwelfare of communities, which would result in making the\n\nrequirement of Aadhaar virtually mandatory. It was pointed out\n\nthat by issuing various circulars the Government has already\n\nbrought within the sweep of\nSection 7\n, almost 139 such\n\nsubsidies, services and benefits.\n\n321) No doubt, the Government cannot take umbrage under the\n\naforesaid provision to enlarge the scope of subsidies, services\n\nand benefits. ‘Benefits’ should be such which are in the nature of\n\nwelfare schemes for which resources are to be drawn from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India.\n\nTherefore actions by CBSE, NEET, JEE and UGC requirements\n\nfor scholarship shall not be covered under\nSection 7\n, unless it is\n\ndemonstrated that the expenditure is incurred from Consolidated\n\nFund of India. Further, the expression ‘benefit’ has to be read\n\nejusdem generis with the preceding word ‘subsidies’.\n\n322) We also make it clear that a benefit which is earned by an\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 390 of 567\n\nindividual (e.g. pension by a government employee) cannot be\n\ncovered under\nSection 7\nof the Act, as it is the right of the\n\nindividual to receive such benefit.\n\nAt the same time, we have gone through the list of notifications\n\nwhich are issued under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act. We find\n\nthat most of these notifications pertain to various welfare\n\nschemes under which benefits, subsidies or services are provided\n\nto the intending recipients. Moreover, in order to avail the\n\nbenefits, only one time verification is required except for few\n\nservices where annual verification is needed. It is only in respect\n\nof fertilizer subsidy where authentication is required every time\n\nthe fertilizer is disbursed. However, it is clarified that fertilizer is\n\nalso given on the basis of other documents such as Kisan Credit\n\nCard, etc. At the same time, we hope that the respondents shall\n\nnot unduly expand the scope of ‘subsidies, services and benefits’\n\nthereby widening the net of Aadhaar, where it is not permitted\n\notherwise. Insofar as notifications relating to children are\n\nconcerned, we have already dealt with the same separately. We,\n\nthus, conclude this aspect as under:\n\n(a) ‘benefits’ and ‘services’ as mentioned in\nSection 7\nshould be\n\nthose which have the colour of some kind of subsidies etc.,\n\nnamely, welfare schemes of the Government whereby\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 391 of 567\n\nGovernment is doling out such benefits which are targeted at a\n\nparticular deprived class.\n\n(b) The expenditure thereof has to be drawn from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India.\n\n(c) On that basis, CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC etc. cannot make\n\nthe requirement of Aadhaar mandatory as they are outside the\n\npurview of\nSection 7\nand are not backed by any law.\n\nChildren:\n\n323) Though, we have upheld, in general, the validity of Section 7 of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act, one specific aspect thereof is yet to be\n\nconsidered.\nSection 7\nmandates requirement of Aadhaar for the\n\npurposes of receiving certain subsidies, benefits and services.\n\nThus, any individual who wants to seek any of these subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services is compulsorily required to have an\n\nAadhaar number. This will include children as well. Some of the\n\npetitioners as well as some other applicants who have intervened\n\nin these petitions have expressed their concern about the\n\nmandatory requirement of Aadhaar for children and subsequent\n\nlinking for realising their basic rights including education. They\n\nhave referred to various circulars and notifications issued through\n\nvarious functionaries, schools, The Ministry of Human Resource\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 392 of 567\n\nDevelopment (MHRD) which have mandated production of\n\nAadhaar card details for the children seeking admission to\n\nschools and to link the Aadhaar of the students already enrolled.\n\nWe have held that Aadhaar is a voluntary scheme and, therefore,\n\nthe Aadhaar number is to be alloted to an individual on his\n\n‘consent’. No doubt, for the purposes of utilising any of the\n\nbenefits under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, it becomes\n\nnecessary to have Aadhaar number. However, the question is as\n\nto whether it can be extended to children? It is more so when\n\nthey are not under legal capacity to provide any ‘consent’ under\n\nthe law.\n\n324)\nArticle 21A\nof the Constitution guarantees right to education and\n\nmakes it fundamental right of the children between 6 years and\n\n14 years of age. Such a right cannot be taken away by imposing\n\nrequirement of holding Aadhaar card, upon the children.\n\n325) In view thereof, admission of a child in his school cannot be\n\ncovered under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act as it is neither\n\nsubsidy nor service. No doubt, the expression ‘benefit’ occurring\n\nin\nSection 7\nis very wide. At the same time, it has to be given\n\nrestrictive meaning and the admission of children in the schools,\n\nwhen they have fundamental right to education, would not be\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 393 of 567\n\ncovered by\nSection 7\n, in our considered view. The respondents\n\nmade an attempt to justify the linkage of Aadhaar with child\n\ninformation and records by arguing that there have been several\n\ninstances of either impersonations at examinations or bogus\n\nadmissions which have the potential to pilfer away various\n\nscholarship schemes which the Government provides for weaker\n\nsections from time to time. If this is the objective, then also\n\nrequirement of Aadhaar cannot insisted at the time of admission\n\nbut only at the stage of application for Government scholarships.\n\nInsofar as impersonation at examination is concerned, that can\n\nbe easily checked and contained by other means with effective\n\nchecks and balances. When there are alternative means,\n\ninsistence on Aadhaar would not satisfy the test or proportionality.\n\nThis would violate the privacy right of the children importance\n\nwhereto is given by the Constitution Bench in K.S. Puttaswamy in\n\nthe following words:\n\n“633. Children around the world create perpetual digital\nfootprints on social network websites on a 24/7 basis as\nthey learn their ‘ABCs’: Apple, Bluetooth, and Chat followed\nby Download, E-Mail, Facebook, Google, Hotmail, and\nInstagram. They should not be subjected to the\nconsequences of their childish mistakes and naivety, their\nentire life. Privacy of children will require special protection\nnot just in the context of the virtual world, but also the real\nworld.”\n\n326) It is also important to note herein that the\nJuvenile Justice Act\n,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 394 of 567\n\n2015 while addressing children in need of care and protection\n\nand children in conflict with law enunciates that the records of the\n\nchildren are confidential and will not be parted with unless\n\nrequested by the Children’s Court. In contrast, the submission of\n\nthe Union justifying linking of Aadhaar with student records on\n\nmalpractice in examinations and potential bogus admissions with\n\nno safeguards whatsoever.\n\n327) It has to be kept in mind that when the children are incapable of\n\ngiving consent, foisting compulsion of having Aadhaar card upon\n\nthem would be totally disproportionate and would fail to meet the\n\nproportionality test. As the law exists today, a child can hold\n\nproperty, operate a bank account, be eligible to be a nominee in\n\nan insurance policy or a bank account or have any financial\n\ntransaction only through a legal guardian who has to be a major\n\nof sound mind. In cases where a child is in conflict with the law,\n\nthe child is given a special criminal trial under the\nJuvenile Justice\n\n(Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015\nand there is a\n\nmandatory requirement for the records to be kept confidential and\n\ndestroyed so that the criminal record of the child is not\n\nmaintained. This is the position in law contained in\nSection 11\nof\n\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872, Section 45ZA of the Banking\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 395 of 567\n\nRegulation Act, 1949\n,\nSection 39\nof the Insurance Act, 1938,\n\nSection 90\nof the Indian Penal Code (which provides that consent\n\nof the child who is under 12 years of age shall not be regarded as\n\nconsent) etc. Thus, when a child is not competent to contract;\n\nnot in a position to consent; barred from transferring property;\n\nprohibited from taking employment; and not allowed to\n\nopen/operate bank accounts and, as a consequence, not in a\n\nposition to negotiate her rights, thirsting upon compulsory\n\nrequirement of holding Aadhaar would be an inviable inroad into\n\ntheir fundamental rights under\nArticle 21.\nThe restriction imposed\n\non such a right in the form of an Aadhaar cannot be treated as\n\nconstitutionally justified. We may also mention here that State is\n\nsupposed to keep in mind the best interest of the children which\n\nis regarded as primary consideration in our Constitution (See\n\nR.D. Upadhyay v. State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors.107\n). The\n\nconvention on the Rights of Child 108 reiterates that the best\n\ninterests of the child will be the basic concern of the parents or\n\nlegal guardians of the child. The Constitution affirms acting in the\n\nbest interest of the children and confers the responsibility on the\n\nState to not only safeguard the best interests of children but also\n\nact in furtherance of it. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the\n107(2007) 15 SCC 49\n108India acceded to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in December 1992 to reiterate its\ncommitment to the cause of the children.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 396 of 567\n\nState is constitutionally bound to facilitate and enable the parents\n\nand guardians of the children to assert their rights and act in their\n\nbest interest and this has to be done without having any\n\nmandatory directives to it. The onus of overseeing and lawfully\n\nsafeguarding the rights and immunities, to which children are\n\nentitled to, rests on the State and the authorities under it. Giving\n\nproper education to children and ensuring that they become\n\nvaluable citizens of this nation subserves public interest. This is\n\nthe mandate of Convention on the Rights of Child (CRC) as well.\n\nWe may reproduce\nArticle 27\nof the CRC:\n\n“States Parties recognize the right of every child to a\nstandard of living adequate for the child’s physical, mental,\nspiritual, moral and social development.\n\n2. The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have\nthe primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities\nand financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary\nfor the child’s development.\n\n3. States Parties, in accordance with national conditions\nand within their means, shall take appropriate measures to\nassist parents and others responsible for the child to\nimplement this right and shall in case of need provide\nmaterial assistance and support programmes, particularly\nwith regard to nutrition, clothing and housing.”\n\n328)\nArticle 8\nof the CRC provides that:\n\n“(2) For the purpose of guaranteeing and promoting the\nrights set forth in the present Convention, States Parties\nshall render appropriate assistance to parents and legal\nguardians in the performance of their child-rearing\nresponsibilities and shall ensure the development of\ninstitutions, facilities and services for the care of children.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 397 of 567\n\n(3) States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to\nensure that children of working parents have the right to\nbenefit from child-care services and facilities for which they\nare eligible.”\n\n329) Further,\nArticle 16\nof the Convention on the Rights of Child, 1989\n\nbars children from being subject to arbitrary or unlawful\n\ninterference in their privacy, family, home, or correspondence.\n\nOne of the principles espousing the\nJuvenile Justice Act, 2015\nis\n\nthe principle of confidentiality.\nSection 24\nof the Act, dealing with\n\nchildren in conflict with law, further emphasizes:\n\n“(2) The Board shall make an order directing the Police, or\nby the Children’s court to its own registry that the relevant\nrecords of such conviction shall be destroyed after the\nexpiry of the period of appeal or, as the case may be, a\nreasonable period as may be prescribed.”\n\n330)\nSection 3\nof the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 expounds the\n\nprinciples underlying the process in dealing with children under\n\nthe Statute. The principle of right to privacy and confidentiality\n\nemphasizes, “Every child shall have a right to protection of his\n\nprivacy and confidentiality, by all means and throughout the\n\njudicial process.”\n\n331) We would like to reproduce the following observations of English\n\nquote in Murray v. Big Pictures (UK) Ltd.109 where greatest\n\n109(2008) 3 WLR 1360\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 398 of 567\n\nsignificance is attached to the privacy right when it comes to\n\nchildren. That was a case where photographer had taken a series\n\nof photographs of a writer’s infant son, which were later published\n\nin a newspaper. The issue was whether there was misuse of\n\nprivate information by taking photographs. It was held that:\n\n“The question of whether there is a reasonable expectation\nof privacy is a broad one, which takes account of all the\ncircumstances of the case. They include the attributes of\nthe claimant, the nature of the activity in which the claimant\nwas engaged, the place at which it was happening, the\nnature and purpose of the intrusion, the absence of\nconsent and whether it was known or could be inferred, the\neffect on the claimant and the circumstances in which and\nthe purposes for which the information came into the hands\nof the publisher...It is at least arguable that David had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. The fact that he is a\nchild is in our view of greater significance than the judge\nthought.”\n\nWe may also record at this stage that various circulars,\n\norders and notifications are issued by different Ministries and\n\nDepartments under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act which pertain to\n\nchildren. Some of these are:\n\n(1) National Child Labour Project (NCLP).\n\n(2) Scholarship schemes which are given to school students,\n\nlike National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme;\n\nNational Scheme of Incentive to Girls for Secondary\n\nEducation; Benefit to 6 to 14 years children under Sarva\n\nShiksha Abhiyan; Inclusive Education of the Disabled at\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 399 of 567\n\nSecondary State; and Mid-day Meal for Children.\n\n(3) Assistance/Scholarship given by the Department of\n\nEmpowerment to the Persons with Disabilities, which\n\ninclude Scholarship Schemes for education of students\n\nwith disabilities.\n\n(4) Following Schemes floated by the Ministry of Women and\n\nChild Development, some of which relate to children:\n\n(a) Supplementary Nutrition Programme under ICDS\n\nScheme.\n\n(b) Payment of honorarium to AWWs & AWHs under\n\nICDS Scheme.\n\n(c) Supplementary Nutrition for children offered at Creche\n\nCentres.\n\n(d) Honorarium paid towards the Creche Workers and\n\nCreche Helpers.\n\n(e) Maternity Benefit Programme (MBP).\n\n(f) Scheme for Adolescent Girls.\n\n(g) National Mission for Empowerment of Women.\n\n(h) ICDS Training Programme.\n\n(i) Ujjawala Scheme.\n\n(j) Swadhar Scheme.\n\n(k) Integrated Child Protection Scheme.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 400 of 567\n\n(l) STEP programme.\n\n(m) Rashtriya Mahila Kosh.\n\n(n) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vanana Yojana.\n\n(5) Painting and Essay competitions for school children under\n\nIEC component of Human Resource Development and\n\nCapacity Building.\n\n332) After considering the matter in depth and having regard to the\n\ndiscussion aforesaid, we hold as under:\n\n(a) For the enrolment of children under the Aadhaar Act, it\n\nwould be essential to have the consent of their parents/guardian.\n\n(b) On attaining the age of majority, such children who are\n\nenrolled under Aadhaar with the consent of their parents, shall be\n\ngiven the right to exit from Aadhaar, if they so choose.\n\n(c) Insofar as the school admissions of children are concerned,\n\nrequirement of Aadhaar would not be compulsory as it is neither a\n\nservice nor subsidy. Further, having regard to the fact that a child\n\nbetween the age of 6 to 14 years has the fundamental right to\n\neducation under\nArticle 21A\nof the Constitution, school admission\n\ncannot be treated as ‘benefit’ as well.\n\n(d) Benefits to children between 6 to 14 years under Sarva\n\nShiksha Abhiyan, likewise, shall not require mandatory Aadhaar\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 401 of 567\n\nenrolment.\n\n(e) For availing the benefits of other welfare schemes which are\n\ncovered by Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, though enrolment\n\nnumber can be insisted, it would be subject to the consent of the\n\nparents, as mentioned in (a) above.\n\n(f) We also clarify that no child shall be denied benefit of any of\n\nthese schemes if, for some reasons, she is not able to produce\n\nthe Aadhaar number and the benefit shall be given by verifying\n\nthe identity on the basis of any other documents. We may record\n\nthat a statement to this effect was also made by Mr. K.K.\n\nVenugopal, learned Attorney General for India, at the Bar.\n\nChallenge to the other provisions of the Aadhaar Act:\n\n333) The petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of certain\n\nother provisions of Aadhaar Act as well. They have submitted\n\ntheir reasons on the basis of which they are seeking the\n\ndeclaration to the effect these provisions are unconstitutional. We\n\nreproduce the provisions of Aadhaar Act as well as reasons given\n\nby the petitioners in tabulated form, as under:\n\nS.No. Provisions of the Reason for being unconstitutional\nAadhaar Act\n\n1.\nSection 2(c)\nand\n2(d)\n- ‘Authentication Record’ includes the time of\nauthentication and authentication and the identity of the\nauthentication record, requesting entity. The UIDAI and the\nread with\nSection 32\nAuthentication Service Agency (ASA) is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 402 of 567\n\npermitted to store this authentication record\nfor 2+5 years (as per Regulations 20 and\n26/27 of the Authentication Regulations).\n\nBy definition it provides for real-time\nsurveillance and profiling. The record\nstores both the time and the identity of the\nrequesting entity.\n\n2.\nSection 2(h)\nread with The notion of CIDR is by itself an\n\nSection 10\nof CIDR unconstitutional database. The statute\ncannot operate without a CIDR. The notion\nof a CIDR where every individual’s\nbiometric as well as demographic\ninformation is centrally stored is an\nauthoritarian or police state construct and\nhas no place in a democracy that\nguarantees individual freedom. A CIDR\nfrom where data can be backed, and which\nis operated not by the respondents but by\nforeign entities, is conceptually and\nconstitutionally an impermissible\ncompromise on national sovereignty and\nsecurity.\n\nNotably,\nSection 10\nempowers UIDAI to\nappoint one or more entity to establish and\nmaintain the CIDR.\n\n3.\nSection 2(l)\nread with The notion of an enrolling agency as\n\nRegulation 23\nof the defined in\nSection 2(l)\nis also\nAadhaar (Enrolment unconstitutional inasmuch as the agency,\nand Updates) as defined, need not be a Government\nRegulation - ‘enrolling entity but could be a private entity. The\nagency’ collection of sensitive personal biometric\nand demographic data and information for\nthe purposes of storage must be conducted\nby a Government agency alone since this is\na bare minimum procedural safeguard\nagainst the misuse and commercial\nexploitation of private personal information.\nThe State, acting as a trustee and fiduciary,\ncannot delegate or require private enrolling\nagencies to discharge this non-delegable\nfunction. Moreover, an enrolling agency\nthat is operated privately cannot be\nentrusted with the crucial tasks of\nexplaining the voluntary nature of Aadhaar\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 403 of 567\n\nenrolments and securing informed consent.\n\n4.\nSection 2(v)\n- ‘resident’ The expression ‘Resident’ defined in\n\nSection 2(v)\nis arbitrary and\nunconstitutional inasmuch as the Act\ncreates no credible machinery for\nevaluating a claim that a person has been\nresiding in India for a period of 182 days or\nmore, in the 12 months immediately\npreceding the date of application for\nenrolment. The forms being used by the\nrespondents as also proof of identification\nand proof of address requirement being\nused by the respondents until enactment of\nthe statute nowhere require any proof\nrelating to residence for 182 days. The\nimpugned Act purports to validate all these\nenrolments. The forms being used by the\nrespondents do not even contain a\ndeclaration regarding the enrolee being\nresident for 182 days. Further, there is no\nrequirement in the definition of ‘Resident’\nthat the person has to be legally resident\nand the expression would wrongly take in\nillegal immigrants as well.\n\n5.\nSection 3\n– Aadhaar It is an ‘entitlement’. It cannot be\nNumber understood to be mandatory. The\ninformation provided under\nSection 3(2)\nis\nof no relevance if obtaining Aadhaar is\nmade mandatory. By design, Aadhaar was\nnever meant to be mandatory.\n\n6.\nSection 5\n– Special Section 5 of the Aadhaar Act, inasmuch as\ntreatment to children it extends to children and persons with\ndisabilities, implies that the State is\nsecuring biometric and demographic data\neven before the age of consent insofar as\nchildren are concerned.\nThe Act\nin its\ncoercive reach and application to children\nwho have not attained the age of consent is\nper se unconstitutional and violate of the\nfundamental rights of the children.\n\n7.\nSection 6\n– Update of\nSection 6\nof the Act is unconstitutional\ninformation inasmuch as it enables the respondents to\ncontinually compel residents to periodically\nfurnish demographic and biometric\ninformation. This provision is coercive in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 404 of 567\n\noperation and effect and not only\nundermines the so-called ‘voluntary’ nature\nof the programme (as falsely claimed by\nthe respondents) but also undermines the\nfalse claim with respect to the ‘reliability of\nbiometrics’.\n\n8.\nSection 8\n\nSection 8\nis unconstitutional inasmuch as it\nenables tracking, tagging and profiling of\nindividuals through the authentication\nprocess. It is a charter for surveillance in\nreal time and with a degree of specificity\nthat enables persons’ physical movements\nto be traced in real time. The\nauthentication mandate in terms of\nSection\nis not being worked by the respondents\nthrough any proprietary technology and is\noutsourced to foreign entities or entities\nunder the ownership and control of foreign\ncompanies and corporations. The entire\nframework and working of the\nauthentication procedure in terms of\n\nSection 8\nis an impermissible, permanent\nand irreversible compromise of national\nsovereignty and national security.\n\n9.\nSection 9\nSection 9 of the Aadhaar Act is also\nunconstitutional inasmuch as the Aadhaar\nnumber is de facto serving as proof of\ncitizenship and domicile. This is seen from\nvarious media reports where even in the\nabsence of any rigorous verification\nprocess, Aadhaar numbers are being\nissued. The petitioners submit that equally\nsubversive of national security and national\nintegrity is the practice of passports being\nissued based upon an Aadhaar card. In\nother words, persons who may not be\nentitled to passports are having Aadhaar\nnumbers issued and thereafter securing\npassports in violation of the citizenship\nprovisions.\n\n10. Chapter IV – Sections The petitioners submit that the whole of\n11 to 23\nChapter IV of the Act\ncomprising\nSections\nto\nis ultra vires and unconstitutional.\nThe Constitution does not permit the\nestablishment of an authority that in turn\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 405 of 567\n\nthrough an invasive programme can chain\nevery Indian citizen/resident to a central\ndata bank and maintain lifelong records\nand logs of that individual. The\nConstitution of India when read as a whole\nis designed for a nation of free individuals\nwho enjoy a full range of rights and who are\nentitled under the Constitution to lead their\nlives without any monitoring or scrutiny or\ncontinuous oversight by the State or any of\nits organs. The high value of personal\nfreedom runs throughout the fabric of the\nIndian Constitution and any authority\ncreated for the purpose of ‘cradle to grave’\nscrutiny is directly violative of the personal\nfreedom charter built into the Indian\nConstitution. The Constitution of India\ndoes not contemplate a ‘nanny state’ where\nthe State oversees every individual’s\nconduct and maintains a record of\nindividual interactions. The UIDAI by\ndesign and function is created for an\nabsolutely unconstitutional objective of\ninvading privacy, electronically overseeing\nindividuals and tethering them to a central\ndata repository that will maintain lifelong\nrecords. The notion of individual freedom\nmust entail the right to be alone; the right of\nan individual to be free from any monitoring\nso long as that individual does not breach\nor transgress any criminal law. Here, the\nestablishment of the second respondent is\nfor an unconstitutional purpose of\noverseeing and monitoring individual\nconduct even where the person does not\nremotely fall foul of any law. The second\nrespondent is a State organ designed to\ninvade individual freedom and whose\npurpose is to constrict individual freedom.\n\n11.\nSections 23\nand\n–\nSection 23\n, read with\nSection 54\nof the\nexcessive delegation Aadhaar Act, is unconstitutional on the\nground of excessive delegation.\n\nA perusal of the sub-clauses in\nSection\n23(2)\nand\nSection 54(2)\nindicate that on\nevery crucial aspect pertaining to biometric\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 406 of 567\n\ndata, demographic information, the\noperation and working of the CIDR,\ngenerating and assigning Aadhaar\nnumbers, authentication of Aadhaar\nnumbers, omitting and deactivating\nAadhaar numbers, commercial exploitation\nof information collected by the Government,\netc. are all left entirely to the UIDAI without\nany sufficient defined legislative policy\nindicating the limits within which the UIDAI\nmay legitimately operate.\n\nHaving regard to the invasive nature of the\nAadhaar programme, its deep and\npervasive impact on civil liberties and the\nfiduciary/trusteeship principle based on\nwhich data and information is being\ncollected, it was incumbent upon the\nlegislature to set out detailed and adequate\nlimits to restrict the discretion conferred on\nthe UIDAI. The impugned provisions\nvirtually give an unlimited charter to the\nUIDAI to ride rough shod over fundamental\nrights by framing regulations as it pleases.\n\n12.\nSection 23(2)(g)\nread This empowers the UIDAI alone to omit and\nwith Chapter VI & VII – deactivate an Aadhaar number with almost\nRegulations 27 to 32 of no redressal to the individual Aadhaar\nthe Aadhaar (Enrolment number holder.\nRegulation 27(2)\nprovides\nand Update) that upon cancellation of an Aadhaar\nRegulations, 2016 number, all services provided by the\nauthority shall be permanently disabled.\n\nRegulation 28(2)\nprovides that upon\ndeactivation of an Aadhaar number, all\nnumbers shall be temporarily suspended till\nsuch time that the Aadhaar number holder\nupdates or rectifies the alleged error.\n\nNotably, as per\nRegulation 30\n, there shall\nbe a post facto communication of omission\nor deactivation of the Aadhaar number shall\nbe informed to the Aadhaar number holder.\n\nThe only redressal mechanism provided\nunder the Aadhaar Act is under\nRegulation\nwherein a grievance redressal call\ncentre shall be provided by the UIDAI. This\nprovision provides unbridled power to the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 407 of 567\n\nUIDAI to switch of the life of an individual.\n\nThere is absolutely no redressal\nmechanism for the individual. He is not\neven provided with an opportunity of\nhearing prior to deactivation, which violates\nprinciples of natural justice.\n\n13.\nSection 29\nThis Section is liable to be struck down\ninasmuch as it pertains sharing of identity\ninformation. The provisions suffer from the\nvice of permitting the spread and\ndissemination of sensitive personal\ninformation through a network of entities\nand individuals for commercial gain or\notherwise and allows for the sharing of\ninformation beyond the ostensible object of\ntargeted deliveries.\n\nBoth the biometric as well as the\ndemographic information are entitled to the\nhighest degree of protection and the\nimpugned provision, inasmuch as it draws\na distinction between core biometric\ninformation and other information, creates\nan artificial distinction into two classes of\ninformation which in law are both entitled to\nequal protection against sharing or\ndissemination.\n\nSub-section (4) permits UIDAI by regulation\nto permit ‘core biometric information’ to be\ndisplayed publicly.\n\n14.\nSection 33\n\nSection 33\nis unconstitutional inasmuch as\nit provides for the use of the Aadhaar\ndatabase for police investigation pursuant\nto an order of a competent court.\nSection 3\n\nviolates the protection against self-\n\nincrimination as enshrined under\nArticle\n20(3)\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nFurthermore,\nSection 33\ndoes not afford an\nopportunity of hearing to the concerned\nindividual whose information is sought to be\nreleased by the UIDAI pursuant to the\nCourt’s order. This is contrary to the\nprinciples of natural justice.\n\nSection 33(2)\nprovides for disclosure of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 408 of 567\n\ninformation in the interest of national\nsecurity pursuant to a direction of a\ncompetent officer. The said provision is\nalso hit by the principles of protection\nagainst self-incrimination, as enshrined\nunder\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution.\n\nFurther, the impugned Act does not define\n‘interest of national security’ or otherwise\nlimit the circumstances where the said\nprovision can be invoked. This makes the\nimpugned provision unconstitutional as it\nsuffers from the vice of vagueness and\narbitrariness.\n\n15.\nSection 47\n\nSection 47\nof the impugned Act is\nunconstitutional inasmuch as it does not\nallow an individual citizen who finds that\nthere is a violation of the impugned Act to\ninitiate the criminal process. There could\nbe several circumstances where UIDAI\nitself or some third party is guilty of having\ncommitted offences under the Act. By\nrestricting the initiation of the criminal\nprocess, the Aadhaar Act renders the penal\nmachinery ineffective and sterile. The said\nsection creates a bar on a court to take\ncognizance of any offence under the\nimpugned Act, save on a complaint made\nby the UIDAI or an officer authorized by it.\n\nIn effect there is a bar of cognizance of a\ncomplaint made by an individual for breach\nof his biometric or demographic information\nwhich has been collected by the\nrespondent. Such bar is unconstitutional\nas it forecloses legal remedy to affected\nindividuals.\n\n16.\nSection 48\n– Power of This Section is vague and arbitrary\nCentral Government to inasmuch as it permits the Central\nsupersede UIDAI Government to take over the UIDAI.\nThe\nAct\ndoes not define a ‘pubic emergency’.\n\nThis Section empowers the Central\nGovernment in an ‘emergency’ situation to\nbe in a position to completely control the\nlife of every citizen who is enrolled with the\nUIDAI.\n\n17.\nSection 57\n\nSection 57\nis patently unconstitutional\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 409 of 567\n\ninasmuch as it allows an unrestricted\nextension of the Aadhaar platform to users\nwho may be Government agencies or\nprivate sector operators. This provision\nclearly shows that the impugned Act has a\nmuch wider scope than what may\nlegitimately be considered as a Money Bill.\n\nMoreover, this provision enables the\nseeding of the Aadhaar number across\nservice providers and other gateways and\nthereby enables the establishment of a\nsurveillance state. The impugned provision\nenables the spread of applications and\nAadhaar dependent delivery systems that\nare provided not from Consolidated Fund of\nIndia resources but through any other\nmeans.\n\nIt is submitted that\nSection 57\nalso enables\ncommercial exploitation of an individual’s\nbiometrics and demographic information by\nthe respondents as well as private entities.\nIt ensures that creation of a surveillance\nsociety, where every entity assists the State\nto snoop upon an Aadhaar holder.\n\n18.\nSection 59\n\nSection 59\nof the impugned Act is\nunconstitutional inasmuch as it seeks to\nvalidate all action undertaken by the\nCentral Government pursuant to the\nNotification dated January 28, 2009. It is\nsubmitted that there was no consent, let\nalone informed consent obtained from\nindividuals at the time of enrolment under\nthe said notification.\n\nSuch enrolment which has been conducted\nwithout obtaining adequate consent is\nunconstitutional as it amounts to wrongful\ndeprivation of the most intimate personal\ninformation of an individual. Indeed, taking\nof an individual’s biometric information\nwithout informed consent is a physical\ninvasion of his or her bodily integrity. The\ncollection of demographic information\nthrough private entities and without proper\ncounselling or written informed consent is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 410 of 567\n\nillegal and incapable of being\nretrospectively ratified. All these records\nwhich have been illegally obtained and\ncreated without necessary consent out to\nbe destroyed and cannot be said to be\nvalidated by the impugned provision. The\nParliament cannot create a legal fiction of\n‘consent’ where there was none.\n\nThe executive under the Constitution of\nIndia cannot take away someone’s\nfundamental right to privacy and then\nsupport its action on the proposition of law\nthat ‘retrospectively’ deems consent must\nhave been given.\n\nThe said provision seeks to validate any\naction taken by the Central Government\nalone. The action of private enrolers is not\neven sought to be protected. Therefore, all\ncollections made by private entities under\nthe said notification should also stand\ninvalidated and all data collected by private\nentities should be destroyed forthwith.\n\n334) We have already dealt with the issue of validity of some of the\n\nprovisions. We would now advert to the remaining provisions,\n\nvalidity whereof is questioned.\n\nKeeping in view the preceding discussion, challenge to\n\nmost of these provisions would fail. Insofar as\nSection 2(l)\nread\n\nwith\nRegulation 23\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\nRegulations is concerned which deals with ‘enrolling agency’,\n\nmain challenge is on the ground that the work of an enrolment\n\ncould not have been given to a private entity as private entity\n\ncannot be entrusted with the crucial task of explaining the nature\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 411 of 567\n\nof Aadhaar enrolment and securing informed consent. Further,\n\nthe task of collection of sensitive personal biometric and\n\ndemographic data and information for the purpose of storage\n\ncannot be given to private hands. However, having regard to the\n\nnature of process that has been explained by the Authority, which\n\nensures that immediately on enrolment, the concerned data\n\ncollected by the private entity is beyond its control; it gets\n\nencrypted; and stands transmitted to CIDR, we do not find any\n\nbasis of the apprehension expressed by the petitioners.\n\n335) Insofar as\nSection 2(v)\nis concerned which defines resident, there\n\nis nothing wrong with the definition. The grievance of the\n\npetitioners is that the Aadhaar Act creates no credible machinery\n\nfor availing a claim that a person has been residing in India for\n\n182 days or more. Apprehension is expressed that this\n\nexpression may also facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants.\n\nThese aspects can be taken care of by the respondents by\n\nproviding appropriate mechanism. We direct the respondents to\n\ndo the needful in this behalf. However, that would not render the\n\ndefinition unconstitutional.\n\n336)\nSection 3\n, by the very language thereof, mentions that it is an\n\nenabling provision which ‘entitles’ every resident to obtain\n\nAadhaar number. Therefore, it is voluntary in nature. This is so\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 412 of 567\n\nheld by Division Bench of this Court in Binoy Viswam in the\n\nfollowing words:\n\n“93. Before proceeding to discuss this argument, one\naspect of the matter needs clarification. There was a\ndebate as to whether the Aadhaar Act is voluntary or even\nthat Act makes enrolment under Aadhaar mandatory.\n\n94. First thing that is to be kept in mind is that the Aadhaar\nAct is enacted to enable the Government to identify\nindividuals for delivery of benefits, subsidies and services\nunder various welfare schemes. This is so mentioned in\nSection 7 of the Aadhaar Act which states that proof of\nAadhaar number is necessary for receipt of such subsidies,\nbenefits and services. At the same time, it cannot be\ndisputed that once a person enrols himself and obtains\nAadhaar number as mentioned in Section 3 of the Aadhaar\nAct, such Aadhaar number can be used for many other\npurposes. In fact, this Aadhaar number becomes the\nUnique Identity (UID) of that person. Having said that, it is\nclear that there is no provision in the Aadhaar Act which\nmakes enrolment compulsory. May be for the purpose of\nobtaining benefits, proof of Aadhaar card is necessary as\nper\nSection 7\nof the Act. The proviso to\nSection 7\nstipulates\nthat if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to enable an\nindividual, he shall be offered alternate and viable means\nof identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or\nservice. According to the petitioners, this proviso, which\nacknowledges alternate and viable means of identification,\nand therefore makes Aadhaar optional and voluntary and\nthe enrolment is not necessary even for the purpose of\nreceiving subsidies, benefits and services under various\nschemes of the Government. The respondents, however,\ninterpret the proviso differently and their plea is that the\nwords “if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to an\nindividual” deal with only that situation where application\nfor Aadhaar has been made but for certain reasons\nAadhaar number has not been assigned as it may take\nsome time to give Aadhaar card. Therefore, this proviso is\nonly by way of an interim measure till Aadhaar number is\nassigned, which is otherwise compulsory for obtaining\ncertain benefits as stated in Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act.\n\nFact remains that as per the Government and UIDAI itself,\nthe requirement of obtaining Aadhaar number is voluntary.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 413 of 567\n\nIt has been so claimed by UIDAI on its website and\nclarification to this effect has also been issued by UIDAI.\n\n95. Thus, enrolment under Aadhaar is voluntary. However,\nit is a moot question as to whether for obtaining benefits as\nprescribed under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, it is\nmandatory to give Aadhaar number or not is a debatable\nissue which we are not addressing as this very issue is\nsquarely raised which is the subject-matter of other writ\npetition filed and pending in this Court.”\n\nTherefore, the apprehension of the petitioners that\nSection\nis mandatory stands assuaged.\n\n337)\nSection 5\nis a special measure for issuance of Aadhaar number\n\nto certain category of persons which attempts to take care of\n\ncertain disabilities with which certain individuals may be suffering.\n\nTherefore, this provision is for the benefit of the categories of\n\npersons mentioned in\nSection 5\n. No doubt, it mentions children\n\nand persons with disabilities as well, that is an aspect is already\n\ndealt with separately.\n\n338)\nSection 6\ndeals only with the updation of demographic and\n\nbiometric information. This may become necessary under certain\n\ncircumstances. That by itself does not take away the voluntary\n\nnature of the programme.\n\n339) Insofar\nSection 9\nis concerned, validity thereof is challenged\n\nprimarily on the ground that it serves as a proof of citizenship and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 414 of 567\n\ndomicile as well and some apprehensions are expressed on that\n\nbasis. Such apprehensions have already been taken care of\n\nwhile discussing the issue no. 1 pertaining to surveillance.\n\n340) We have already discussed in detail the purpose of constituting\n\nthe Authority. In fact, the Act cannot operate without such an\n\nAuthority and, therefore, it’s constitution is imperative. Challenge\n\nto validity of\nSections 11\nto\nis predicated on the arguments of\n\nsurveillance etc. fails, having regard to our detailed discussion on\n\nthe said aspect.\n\n341)\nSection 23\nread with\nSection 54\ngive power to the Authority to\n\nmake certain Regulations. We do not find that this provision\n\ngives excessive delegation to the Authority. These aspects have\n\nalready been discussed while determining the issue pertaining to\n\nsurveillance.\n\n342) Apprehension expressed qua\nSection 29\nare equally unfounded.\n\nThis Section rather imposes restrictions on sharing information.\n\nNo doubt, sub-section (2) states that the identity information (and\n\nspecifically excludes core biometric information) can be shared\n\nonly in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in such a\n\nmanner as may be specified by Regulations. That would not\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 415 of 567\n\nmake the provision unconstitutional when it is with the consent of\n\nthe individual. In case, any regulation is made which permits\n\nsharing of information that may contain undesirable\n\ncircumstance/reason for sharing information, such a regulation\n\ncan always be struck down. Insofar as sub-section (4) is\n\nconcerned, it is generally in favour of the residents/individuals\n\ninasmuch as it states that information collected or created under\n\nthis Act shall not be published, displayed or posted publicly. The\n\nis grievance, however, is that this provision enables the Authority\n\nto publish or display etc. such an information ‘for the purposes as\n\nmay be specified by regulations’. The apprehension is that under\n\nthis provision, the Government can always make regulations\n\npermitting publication of such information under certain\n\ncircumstances. At present, regulations which are in force are the\n\nAadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations, 2016. Chapter II\n\nthereof is titled ‘restriction on sharing of identity information’.\n\nRegulation 3(1)\nwhich falls under this chapter puts a categorical\n\nban on sharing of core biometric information collected by the\n\nAuthority under the Act, by mandating that it shall not be sharing\n\nwith anyone for any reason whatsoever. Sub-regulation (2) of\n\nRegulation 3\npermits sharing of demographic information and\n\nphotograph of an individual collected by the Authority under the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 416 of 567\n\nAct, only with the consent of the Aadhaar number holder, that too\n\nfor authentication process in accordance with Authentication\n\nRegulations. As already held by us, insofar as utilisation of\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services are concerned, the\n\nauthentication would be needed by the provider of such services\n\nwhich would be the requesting entity and this provision has\n\nalready been upheld. Sub-regulation (3) permits sharing of\n\nauthentication records of Aadhaar number holder with him in\n\naccordance with\nRegulation 28\nof the Authentication Regulations.\n\nThis provision facilitates obtaining the information from the\n\nAuthority by the Aadhaar number holder herself. We are, thus, of\n\nthe opinion that\nSection 29\nand the sharing regulations are the\n\nprovisions enacted to protect the interest of Aadhaar card holders\n\nas they put restrictions on the sharing of information, which may\n\nbe described as provisions pertaining to data protection and\n\nsurveying legitimate state aim/interest as well. No doubt,\nSection\ngives power to the delegatee to make regulations. However,\n\nas already clarified above, as and when a regulation is made,\n\nwhich impinges upon the privacy right of the Aadhaar card\n\nholders, that can always be challenged. As of now, sharing\n\nregulations do not contain any such provision.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 417 of 567\n\n343)\nSection 33\nprovides for disclosure of information in certain cases.\n\nThe challenge to this provision is predicated on the ground that it\n\nprovides for the use of Aadhaar database for police verification,\n\nwhich is against the ethos of\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia, which is a rule against self-incrimination. In order to\n\nappreciate this argument, we would like to reproduce\nSection 33\n\nin its entirety:\n\n“33. (1) Nothing contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section\n(5) of\nsection 28\nor sub-section (2) of\nsection 29\nshall apply\nin respect of any disclosure of information, including\nidentity information or authentication records, made\npursuant to an order of a court not inferior to that of a\nDistrict Judge:\n\nProvided that no order by the court under this sub-\nsection shall be made without giving an opportunity of\nhearing to the Authority.\n\n(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (5)\nof\nsection 28\nand clause (b) of sub-section (1), sub-section\n(2) or sub-section (3) of\nsection 29\nshall apply in respect of\nany disclosure of information, including identity information\nor authentication records, made in the interest of national\nsecurity in pursuance of a direction of an officer not below\nthe rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India\nspecially authorised in this behalf by an order of the Central\nGovernment:\n\nProvided that every direction issued under this sub-\nsection, shall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee\nconsisting of the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to\nthe Government of India in the Department of Legal Affairs\nand the Department of Electronics and Information\nTechnology, before it takes effect:\n\nProvided further that any direction issued under this\nsub-section shall be valid for a period of three months from\nthe date of its issue, which may be extended for a further\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 418 of 567\n\nperiod of three months after the review by the Oversight\nCommittee.”\n\n344) A close look at sub-section (1) of\nSection 33\nwould demonstrate\n\nthat the sub-section (1) is an exception to\nSection 28(2)\n,\nSection\n\n28(5)\nand\nSection 29(2)\nof the Act. Those provisions put a bar on\n\nthe disclosure of an information thereby protecting the information\n\navailable with the UIDAI in respect of any person. However, as\n\nper sub-section (1), such information can be disclosed if there is\n\nan order of a court which order is not inferior to that of a District\n\nJudge. This provision, therefore, only states that in suitable\n\ncases, if court passes an order directing an Authority to disclose\n\nsuch an information, then the Authority would be obliged to do so.\n\nThus, an embargo contained in\nSections 28\nand\nis partially\n\nlifted only in the eventuality on passing an order by the court not\n\ninferior to that of District Judge. This itself is a reasonable\n\nsafeguard. Obviously, in any proceedings where the Court feels\n\nsuch an information is necessary for the determination of\n\ncontroversy that is before the Court, before passing such an\n\norder, it would hear the concerned parties which will include the\n\nperson in respect of whom the disclosure of information is sought.\n\nWe, therefore, clarify that provisions of sub-section (1) of\nSection\nby reading into the provisions that an individual whose\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 419 of 567\n\ninformation is sought to be released shall be afforded an\n\nopportunity of hearing. There is a reasonable presumption that\n\nthe said court shall take into consideration relevant law including\n\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution as well as privacy rights or other\n\nrights of that person before passing such an order. Moreover, a\n\nperson in respect of whom order is passed shall also be heard\n\nand will have right to challenge the order in a higher forum. Not\n\nonly this, proviso to\nSection 33(1)\nputs an additional safeguard by\n\nproviding that even UIDAI shall be heard before an order is\n\npassed to this effect by the Court. In that sense, the Authority is\n\nto act as trustee and it may object to passing of the order by the\n\ncourt. Such a happening is actually taken place. We have\n\nalready noticed that against the order of the High Court of\n\nBombay in some criminal proceedings, order was passed\n\ndirecting the Authority to give biometric information of a person,\n\nthe Authority had filed Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 2524\n\nof 2014 challenging the said order on the ground that giving of\n\nsuch biometric information was contrary to the provisions of the\n\nAadhaar Act as the information was confidential. This Court\n\nstays the operation of the said order which depicts that there are\n\nsufficient safeguards provided in sub-section (1) of\nSection 33\n\nitself.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 420 of 567\n\n345) Adverting to sub-section (2) of\nSection 33\n, it can be seen that this\n\nprovision enables disclosure of information including identity\n\ninformation records in the interest of national security. This\n\nprovision further states that the Authority is obliged to disclose\n\nsuch information in pursuance of a direction of an officer not\n\nbelow the rank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India\n\nspecially authorised in this behalf by an order of the Central\n\nGovernment. Proviso thereto sub-section (2) puts an additional\n\nsafeguard by prescribing that every direction issued under this\n\nsub-section shall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee\n\nconsisting of the Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the\n\nGovernment of India in the Department of Legal Affairs and the\n\nDepartment of Electronics and Information Technology before it\n\ntakes effect. Further, such a direction is valid only for a period of\n\nthree months from the date of its issue which can be extended by\n\nanother three months.\n\n346) Main contention of the petitioners in challenging the provisions of\n\nsub-section (2) of\nSection 33\nare that no definition of national\n\nsecurity is provided and, therefore, it is a loose ended provision\n\nsusceptible to misuse. It is also argued that there is no\n\nindependent oversight disclosure of such data on the ground of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 421 of 567\n\nsecurity and also that the provision is unreasonable and\n\ndisproportionate and, therefore, unconstitutional.\n\n347) We may point out that this Court has held in Ex-Armymen’s\n\nProtection Services Private Limited v. Union of India & Ors.110\nthat\n\nwhat is in the interest of national security is not a question of law\n\nbut it is a matter of policy. We would like to reproduce following\n\ndiscussion therefrom:\n\n“16. What is in the interest of national security is not a\nquestion of law. It is a matter of policy. It is not for the court\nto decide whether something is in the interest of the State\nor not. It should be left to the executive. To quote Lord\nHoffman in Secy. of State for Home Deptt. v. Rehman\n[(2003) 1 AC 153 : (2001) 3 WLR 877 : (2002) 1 All ER 122\n(HL)] : (AC p. 192C)\n\n“… [in the matter] of national security is not a\nquestion of law. It is a matter of judgment and policy.\n\nUnder the Constitution of the United Kingdom and\nmost other countries, decisions as to whether\nsomething is or is not in the interests of national\nsecurity are not a matter for judicial decision. They\nare entrusted to the executive.”\n\n17. Thus, in a situation of national security, a party cannot\ninsist for the strict observance of the principles of natural\njustice. In such cases, it is the duty of the court to read into\nand provide for statutory exclusion, if not expressly\nprovided in the rules governing the field. Depending on the\nfacts of the particular case, it will however be open to the\ncourt to satisfy itself whether there were justifiable facts,\nand in that regard, the court is entitled to call for the files\nand see whether it is a case where the interest of national\nsecurity is involved. Once the State is of the stand that the\nissue involves national security, the court shall not disclose\nthe reasons to the affected party.”\n\n110 (2014) 5 SCC 409\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 422 of 567\n\n348) Even in K.S. Puttaswamy, this Court has recognised data\n\nretention by the Government which may be necessitated in the\n\npublic interest and in the interest of national security. We may\n\nalso usefully refer to the judgment of People’s Union for\nCivil\n\nLiberties (PUCL) v. Union of India & Anr.111\n. In that case, action\n\nof telephone tapping was challenged as serious invasion of\n\nindividual’s privacy. The Court found that\nSection 5(2)\nof the\n\nTelegraph Act, 1885 permits the interception of messages in\n\ncircumstances mentioned therein i.e. ‘occurrence of any public\n\nemergency’ or ‘in the interest of public safety’. The Court\n\nexplained these expressions in the following manner:\n\n“28.\nSection 5(2)\nof the Act permits the interception of\nmessages in accordance with the provisions of the said\nsection. “Occurrence of any public emergency” or “in the\ninterest of public safety” are the sine qua non for the\napplication of the provisions of\nSection 5(2)\nof the Act.\nUnless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of\npublic safety demands, the authorities have no jurisdiction\nto exercise the powers under the said section. Public\nemergency would mean the prevailing of a sudden\ncondition or state of affairs affecting the people at large\ncalling for immediate action. The expression “public safety”\nmeans the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk\nfor the people at large. When either of these two conditions\nare not in existence, the Central Government or a State\nGovernment or the authorised officer cannot resort to\ntelephone-tapping even though there is satisfaction that it\nis necessary or expedient so to do in the interests of\nsovereignty and integrity of India etc. In other words, even\nif the Central Government is satisfied that it is necessary or\nexpedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty and\nintegrity of India or the security of the State or friendly\nrelations with sovereign States or public order or for\n\n111 (1997) 1 SCC 301\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 423 of 567\n\npreventing incitement to the commission of an offence, it\ncannot intercept the messages or resort to telephone-\ntapping unless a public emergency has occurred or the\ninterest of public safety or the existence of the interest of\npublic safety requires. Neither the occurrence of public\nemergency nor the interest of public safety are secretive\nconditions or situations. Either of the situations would be\napparent to a reasonable person.”\n\n349) Having regard to the aforesaid legal position, disclosure of\n\ninformation in the interest of national security cannot be faulted\n\nwith. However, we are of the opinion that giving of such\n\nimportant power in the hands of Joint Secretary may not be\n\nappropriate. There has to be a higher ranking officer along with,\n\npreferably, a Judicial Officer. The provisions contained in\nSection\n\n33(2)\nof the Act to the extent it gives power to Joint Secretary is,\n\ntherefore, struck down giving liberty to the respondents to suitably\n\nenact a provision on the aforesaid lines, which would adequately\n\nprotect the interest of individuals.\n\n350) We now advert to the challenge laid to Section 47 of the Aadhaar\n\nAct, which is captioned as ‘cognizance of offences’, it reads as\n\nunder:\n\n“47. (1) No court shall take cognizance of any offence\npunishable under this Act, save on a complaint made by\nthe Authority or any officer or person authorised by it.\n\n(2) No court inferior to that of a Chief Metropolitan\nMagistrate or a Chief Judicial Magistrate shall try any\noffence punishable under this Act.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 424 of 567\n\n351) Certain acts in Chapter VII are treated as offences and penalties\n\nare also provided, from\nSection 34\nto\nSection 43\n.\n\n352)\nSection 44\nclarifies that this Act would apply for offence or\n\ncontravention committed even outside India. Insofar as\n\ninvestigation of these offences is concerned,\nSection 45\nprovides\n\nthat a police officer not below the rank of Inspector of Police shall\n\ninvestigate any offence under this Act.\nSection 46\n, thereafter,\n\nclarifies that penalties imposed under this Act shall not prevent\n\nthe imposition of any other penalty or punishment under any\n\nother law for the time being in force. This scheme of Chapter VII\n\nmakes very strict provisions in respect of enforcement of the Act\n\nwhich includes data protection as well. Last provision in Chapter\n\nVII is\nSection 47\nwhich provides that the cognizance would be\n\ntaken only on a complaint made by the Authority or any officer or\n\nperson authorised by it. Petitioners feel aggrieved by this\n\nprovision as it does not permit an individual citizen whose rights\n\nare violated, to initiate the criminal process. Apprehensions are\n\nexpressed by submitting that there may be a possibility where the\n\nAuthority itself or some Governmental Authority may be guilty of\n\ncommitting the offences under the Act and, in such a situation,\n\nthe Authority or any officer or person authorised by it may choose\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 425 of 567\n\nnot to file any complaint.\n\n353) According to the respondents, the rationale behind\nSection 47\nis\n\nto maintain purity and integrity of CIDR and the entire enrolment\n\nstorage in the CIDR and authentication exercise can be handled\n\nonly by the Authority. For this reason, it is the Authority which is\n\nempowered to lodge the complaint. It is also pointed out that\n\nsimilar provisions akin to Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act are\n\ncontained in many other statutes. Reference is made to\nSection\nof the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,\n\n1957,\nSection 34\nof the Bureau of Indian Standards Act, 1986,\n\nSection 34\nof the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997,\n\nSection 47\nof the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\nSection 26(1)\nof\n\nthe Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992,\nSection 19\n\nof the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,\nSection 43\nof the Air\n\n(Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and\nSection 57(1)\n\nof the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act, 2006.\n\nThe respondents have also submitted that validity of such\n\nprovisions have been tested and affirmed by this Court.\n\nReference is made to the judgment in\nRaj Kumar Gupta v. Lt.\n\nGovernor, Delhi & Ors.112\n. The respondents have also taken\n\nsupport of the decision of this Court in State (NCT of Delhi) v.\n\n112(1997) 1 SCC 556\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 426 of 567\n\nSanjay113 wherein\nSection 22\nof the Mines and Minerals\n\n(Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 was tested. Insofar as\n\ngrievance and apprehension of the petitioners is concerned, it\n\ncan be taken care on interpreting the provisions by holding that\n\nthe Authority can lodge a complaint of its own motion or at the\n\nrequest of the individual whose rights are affected thereby.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, we are of the opinion that it\n\nwould be in the fitness of things if\nSection 47\nis amended by\n\nallowing individual/victim whose right is violated, to file a\n\ncomplaint and initiate the proceedings. We hope that this aspect\n\nshall be addressed at the appropriate level and if considered fit,\n\nSection 47\nwould be suitably amended.\n\n354)\nSection 48\ncannot be treated as vague or arbitrary. ‘Public\n\nEmergency’ is the expression which has been used in several\n\nother enactments and held to be constitutional. It can always be\n\nsubject to scrutiny of the Courts.\n\n355) With this, now we come to a provision which was highly debated.\n\nAt the time of arguments, the petitioners had taken strong\n\nexception to some of its aspects. We may first take note of the\n\nexact language of this provision:\n\n113(2014) 9 SCC 772\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 427 of 567\n\n“57. Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent the use of\nAadhaar number for establishing the identity of an\nindividual for any purpose, whether by the State or any\nbody corporate or person, pursuant to any law, for the time\nbeing in force, or any contract to this effect: Provided that\nthe use of Aadhaar number under this section shall be\nsubject to the procedure and obligations under\nsection 8\n\nand Chapter VI.”\n\n356) In first blush, the provision appears to be innocuous. It enables\n\nAadhaar holder to establish her identity for any purpose as well.\n\nIn that sense, it may amount to empowering the Aadhaar number\n\nholder, when she is carrying unique identity. It is her identity card\n\nwhich she is able to use not only for the purposes mentioned in\n\nthe Aadhaar Act but also for any other purpose.\n\n357) The petitioners, however, have pricked the provision with the\n\nsubmission that it may be susceptible to making deep in-roads in\n\nthe privacy of individuals and is utterly disproportionate. The taint\n\nin the provision, as projected by the petitioners, is that it brings in\n\nprivate parties as well, apart from the State within the fold of\n\nAadhaar network giving untrammeled opportunity to them to\n\ninvade the privacy of such user. The offending portion of the\n\nprovision, according to them, is that:\n\n(a) It allows ‘any body corporate or person’ (thereby\n\nencompassing private bodies/persons as well) to make use of\n\nauthentication process, once an individual offers Aadhaar number\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 428 of 567\n\nfor establishing her identity.\n\n(b) The expression ‘for any purpose’ is wide enough, which\n\nmay be susceptible to misuse.\n\n(c) This is permitted not only pursuant to any law for time being\n\nin force but also pursuant to ‘any contract to this effect’ which\n\nwould mean that individuals may be forced to give their consent\n\nin the form of contract for a purpose that may be justified or not\n\nthereby permitting the private parties to collect biometric\n\ninformation about the said individual.\n\n358) It is argued that there are no procedural safeguards governing\n\nthe actions of the private entities. Equally no remedy is provided\n\nin case such body corporate or person fails or denies services. In\n\nthis hue, it is also argued that it is an excessive piece of\n\nlegislation inasmuch as taking the umbrage of ‘any law’, the\n\nregulations etc. can be framed by including within its fold much\n\nmore than what is provided by Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act. It,\n\ntherefore, according to the petitioners, does not meet the test of\n\nproportionality. Mr. Divan submits that\nSection 57\nis also patently\n\nunconstitutional inasmuch as it allows an unrestricted extension\n\nof the Aadhaar platform to users who may be government\n\nagencies or private sector operators. Moreover, this provision\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 429 of 567\n\nenables the seeding of the Aadhaar number across service\n\nproviders and other gateways and thereby enables the\n\nestablishment of a surveillance state. The impugned provision\n\nenables the spread of applications and Aadhaar dependent\n\ndelivery systems that are provided not from Consolidated Fund of\n\nIndia resources but through any other means. He also submits\n\nthat\nsection 57\nalso enables commercial exploitation of an\n\nindividual’s biometrics and demographic information by the\n\nRespondents as well as private entities.\n\n359) As mentioned above, the respondents contend that it is only an\n\nenabling provision which gives further facilities to Aadhaar card\n\nholder, as per her choice and is, thus, enacted for the benefit of\n\nsuch individuals.\n\n360) We have already discussed in detail the principles on which\n\ndoctrine of proportionality is built upon and the test which need to\n\nbe satisfied. To put in nutshell, the proportionality principles seek\n\nto safeguard citizens from excessive Government measures. The\n\ninquiry, in such cases, is that a particular measure must not be\n\ndisproportionate in two distinctive utilitarian senses:\n\n(i) The cost or burdens of the measure must not clearly exceed\n\nthe likely benefits, which can be described as ‘ends’ or ‘ends-\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 430 of 567\n\nbenefits’ proportionality.\n\n(ii) The measure must not be clearly more costly or more\n\nburdensome than equally alternative measures, which is also\n\ndescribed by some jurists as a concept of necessity and narrow\n\ntailoring and can be referred to as ‘means’ or ‘alternative-means’\n\nproportionality.\n\n361) We have also discussed in detail the principle of proportionality\n\nthat is developed in certain foreign legal regimes, particularly\n\nGermany and Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\n\nOakes114 developed a two-tier constitutional control test. Once\n\nthe claimant has proved a violation of a right guaranteed in the\n\ncharter, the government must satisfy two criteria to establish that\n\nthe limit on individual rights “can be demonstrably justified in a\n\nfree and democratic society.”\n\n362) First, measures limiting a constitutionally protected right must\n\nserve an important objective that “relate[s] to concerns which are\n\npressing and substantial in a free and democratic society.”\n\nLegislation limiting the rights of English-speaking parents in\n\nQuebec to educate their children in English-speaking schools 115\n\nhas been found lacking an important public objective. Likewise,\n\n114(1986) 1 SCR 103\n115Quebec Ass’n of Protestant Sch. Bds. v. Quebec (A.G.), (1984) 2 SCR 66\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 431 of 567\n\nthe Supreme Court of Canada was unable to find any legitimate\n\npublic objective that justified denying protection to gays and\n\nlesbians under Alberta’s human rights law in Vriend v. Alberta116.\n\nIn R. v. Zundel117, it also prohibited an intrusive use of a law that\n\nwas unrelated to the objectives originally contemplated by the\n\nParliament when that law was enacted.\n\n363) Secondly, once an important public objective or end has been\n\nestablished, the selected means to attain it must be “reasonable\n\nand demonstrably justified.” The Court said in\nR. v. Big M Drug\n\nMart Ltd.118\nthat this determination involves “a form of\n\nproportionality test”. Although, it varies depending on the facts of\n\nthe case, the test involves the balancing of public and individual\n\ninterests based on three principles, which are as follows:\n\n(i) the means must be rationally related to the objective. The\n\ncourt has infrequently struck down legislation for lack of any\n\nrational relation to the objective pursued. It employs a rather\n\ndeferential and contextual approach to determine the rational\n\nrelation of a provision to the desired end.\n\n(ii) The means should “impair ‘as little as possible’ the right or\n\nfreedom in question.” This is believe to be the decisive element\n\n116(1998) 1 SCR 493\n117(1992) 2 SCR 731\n118 (1985) 1 SCR 295\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 432 of 567\n\nof proportionality review. It requires that the legislature adopt the\n\nleast intrusive measure capable of attaining the desired objective.\n\n(iii) The public objective and actual effects of the means\n\nadopted for its attainment must be proportionate to an important\n\npublic end or objective. The court noted that even if the means\n\nsatisfies the first two criteria, it may be declared unconstitutional\n\nin view of its disproportionate harmful effects on an individual.\n\n364) Insofar as development of law in Germany is concerned, as\n\nalready discussed in detail, proportionality is defined “as an\n\nexpression of general right of the citizen towards the State that\n\nhis freedom should be limited by the public authorities only to the\n\nextent indispensable for the protection of the public interest.” 119\n\nThe principle of proportionality in German law incorporates three\n\nimportant subprinciples: suitability, necessity, and proportionality\n\nin the narrower sense. According to the High Court of Germany,\n\nany government interference with basic rights must be suitable\n\nand necessary for reaching the ends sought. Its disadvantages to\n\nindividuals “are generally only permissible if the protection of\n\nothers or of the public interest requires them, after having due\n\nregard to the principle of proportionality.”\n\n119 See Nicholas Emiliou, The Principle of Proportionality in European Law: A comparative Study 5\n(Kluwer Law Int’l. 1996).\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 433 of 567\n\n365) The European Union has, by and large, adopted the German\n\nsystem. We have also taken note of the development of doctrine\n\nof proportionality in India through various judgments120.\n\n366) We may mention here that insofar as U.S. Supreme Court is\n\nconcerned, it has refused to apply the least intrusive test 121\n\nThough there was a debate at the bar as to whether this Court\n\nshould adopt European approach of applying least intrusive test\n\nor go by American approach which repeatedly refused to apply\n\nthis test. Without going into this debate, even when we apply the\n\naccepted norms\nlaid down by\nthis Court in Modern Dental\n\nCollege and Research Centre and K.S. Puttaswamy cases, we\n\nare of the view that a part of\nSection 57\ndoes not pass the muster\n\nof proportionality doctrine.\n\n367) The respondents may be right in their explanation that it is only\n\nan enabling provision which entitles Aadhaar number holder to\n\ntake the help of Aadhaar for the purpose of establishing his/her\n\nidentity. If such a person voluntary wants to offer Aadhaar card\n\nas a proof of his/her identity, there may not be a problem.\nOm Kumar & Ors. v. Union of India\n, (2001) 2 SCC 386 where R. v. Oakes was referred to and\nrelied upon;\nTeri Oat Estates (P) Ltd. v. U.T., Chandigarh & Ors.\n, (2004) 2 SCC 130 where the\nCourt stressed upon maintaining a proper balance between adverse effect which the legislation\nor the administrative order may have on the rights, liberties or interests of persons keeping in\nmind the purpose which they were intended to serve; Modern Dental College and Research\nCentre and K.S. Puttaswamy amongst others.\n\n121 Vernonia School District v. Wayne Acton, 515 US 646, 132 L.Ed. 2D 564, Board of Education of\nIndependent School District v. Lindsay Earls, 536 US 822=153 L.Ed.2d. 735.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 434 of 567\n\n368)\nSection 59\n, which is the last provision in the Act is aimed at\n\nvalidating actions taken by the Central Government pursuant to\n\nnotification dated January 28, 2009 till the passing of the Act. It\n\nreads as under:\n\n“59. Anything done or any action taken by the Central\nGovernment under the Resolution of the Government of\nIndia, Planning Commission bearing notification number A-\n43011/02/2009-Admin. I, dated the 28th January, 2009, or\nby the Department of Electronics and Information\nTechnology under the Cabinet Secretariat Notification\nbearing notification number S.O. 2492(E), dated the 12th\nSeptember, 2015, as the case may be, shall be deemed to\nhave been validly done or taken under this Act.”\n\n369) The challenge to this provision is on the premise that in the\n\nregime which prevailed prior to the passing of the Act and the\n\nenrolments into Aadhaar scheme were done, that happened\n\nwithout the consent of the persons who sought enrolment and,\n\ntherefore, those enrolments cannot be validated by making such\n\na provision. It was argued that even the Act makes provisions for\n\ninformed consent which is to be obtained from individuals at the\n\ntime of enrolment and absence of such consent makes the very\n\nenrolment as impermissible thereby violating the right to privacy\n\nand such acts cannot be validated.\n\n370) The contention of the respondents, on the other hand, is that by\n\nthe very nature of the provision, it is intended to be prospective in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 435 of 567\n\nnature with a clear purport in mind, namely, to validate the\n\nnotification dated August 21, 2009 vide which the Authority was\n\ncreated and the Aadhaar scheme was launched by\n\nadministrative fiat. The purpose is to give it a statutory backing.\n\n371) We find that\nSection 59\nuses the expression ‘anything done or\n\nany action under the resolution’. According to us, this\n\nterminology used in the provision by the legislature is clearly to\n\ncover all actions of the Authority including enrolment of\n\nindividuals into Aadhaar scheme. The words ‘shall be deemed to\n\nhave been validly done or taken under this Act’ at the end of the\n\nSection put the things beyond any pale of doubt. The legislative\n\nintent is clear, namely, to make the provision retrospective so as\n\nto cover the actions of the Authority from the date of its\n\nestablishment. Reading the provision in the manner the\n\npetitioners suggest would have the effect of annulling\nSection 59\n\nitself. Such an interpretation cannot be countenanced. We are of\n\nthe opinion that case is squarely covered by the Constitution\n\nBench judgment of this Court in\nWest Ramnad Electric\n\nDistribution Co., Ltd. v. State of Madras & Anr.122as\nwell as\n\nBishambhar Nath Kohli & Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.123\n.\n\n122 (1963) 2 SCR 747\n123 (1966) 2 SCR 158\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 436 of 567\n\n372) We would also like to point out that the submission of the\n\npetitioners that a particular action or a provision or statute which\n\nis hit by\nArticle 14\ncannot be allowed to be validated is repelled by\n\nthis Court in\nState of Mysore & Anr. v. D. Achiah Chetty, Etc.124\n.\n\nThe legislature is, thus, empowered to incorporate deeming\n\nprovisions in a statute. This proposition has also been repeatedly\n\naffirmed by this Court. We may refer in this behalf the decision in\n\nState of Karnataka v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.\n125 will be of\n\nrelevance wherein the Court held as under:\n\n“72. The second limb of submission of Mr Rohatgi as\nregards the maintainability pertains to the language\nemployed under\nSection 6(2)\nof the 1956 Act, which reads\nas follows:\n\n“6. (2) The decision of the Tribunal, after its\npublication in the Official Gazette by the Central\nGovernment under sub-section (1), shall have the\nsame force as an order or decree of the Supreme\nCourt.”\n\n73. Relying on\nSection 6(2)\n, which was introduced by way\nof the\nAmendment Act, 2002\n(Act 14 of 2002) that came\ninto force from 6-8-2002, it is submitted by Mr Rohatgi that\nthe jurisdiction of this Court is ousted as it cannot sit over in\nappeal on its own decree. The said submission is seriously\nresisted by Mr Nariman and Mr Naphade, learned Senior\nCounsel contending that the said provision, if it is to be\ninterpreted to exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court\nof India, it has to be supported by a constitutional\namendment adding at the end of\nArticle 136(2)\nthe words\n“or to any determination of any tribunal constituted under\nthe law made by Parliament under\nArticle 262(2)\n” and, in\nsuch a situation, in all possibility such an amendment to the\nConstitution may be ultra vires affecting the power of\n\n124(1969) 1 SCC 248\n125(2017) 3 SCC 362\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 437 of 567\n\njudicial review which is a part of basic feature of the\nConstitution. The learned Senior Counsel for the\nrespondent has drawn a distinction between the\nconferment and the exclusion of the power of the Supreme\nCourt of India by the original Constitution and any\nexclusion by the constitutional amendment. Be that as it\nmay, the said aspect need not be adverted to, as we are\nonly required to interpret\nSection 6(2)\nas it exists today on\nthe statute book. The said provision has been inserted to\nprovide teeth to the decision of the Tribunal after its\npublication in the Official Gazette by the Central\nGovernment and this has been done keeping in view the\nSarkaria Commission's Report on Centre-State Relations\n(1980). The relevant extract of the Sarkaria Commission's\nReport reads as follows:\n\n“17.4.19.\nThe Act\nwas amended in 1980 and Section\n6-A was inserted. This section provides for framing a\nscheme for giving effect to a Tribunal's award. The\nscheme, inter alia provides for the establishment of\nthe authority, its term of office and other conditions of\nservice, etc. But the mere creation of such an agency\nwill not be able to ensure implementation of a\nTribunal's award. Any agency set up under Section 6-\nA cannot really function without the cooperation of the\nStates concerned. Further, to make a Tribunal's\naward binding and effectively enforceable, it should\nhave the same force and sanction behind it as an\norder or decree of the Supreme Court. We\nrecommend that the Act should be suitably amended\nfor this purpose.\n\n***\n\n17.6.05.\nThe Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956\n\nshould be amended so that a Tribunal's award has\nthe same force and sanction behind it as an order or\ndecree of the Supreme Court to make a Tribunal's\naward really binding.”\n\n74. The Report of the Commission as the language would\nsuggest, was to make the final decision of the Tribunal\nbinding on both the States and once it is treated as a\ndecree of this Court, then it has the binding effect. It was\nsuggested to make the award effectively enforceable. The\nlanguage employed in\nSection 6(2)\nsuggests that the\ndecision of the Tribunal shall have the same force as the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 438 of 567\n\norder or decree of this Court. There is a distinction between\nhaving the same force as an order or decree of this Court\nand passing of a decree by this Court after due\nadjudication. Parliament has intentionally used the words\nfrom which it can be construed that a legal fiction is meant\nto serve the purpose for which the fiction has been created\nand not intended to travel beyond it. The purpose is to\nhave the binding effect of the Tribunal's award and the\neffectiveness of enforceability. Thus, it has to be narrowly\nconstrued regard being had to the purpose it is meant to\nserve.\n\n75. In this context, we may usefully refer to the Principles\nof Statutory Interpretation, 14th Edn. by G.P. Singh. The\nlearned author has expressed thus:\n\n“In interpreting a provision creating a legal fiction, the\ncourt is to ascertain for what purpose the fiction is\ncreated [\nState of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha\nVilas Cashewnut Factory\n, AIR 1953 SC 333;\nState of\nBombay v. Pandurang Vinayak\n, AIR 1953 SC 244 :\n1953 Cri LJ 1094] , and after ascertaining this, the\nCourt is to assume all those facts and consequences\nwhich are incidental or inevitable corollaries to the\ngiving effect to the fiction.\n\n[East End Dwellings Co.\nLtd.v. Finsbury Borough Council, 1952 AC 109 :\n(1951) 2 All ER 587 (HL);\nCIT v. S.

State of Bihar\n,\nAIR 1955 SC 661;\nCIT v. Amarchand N. Shroff\n, AIR\n1963 SC 1448], or beyond the language of the\nsection by which it is created.\n[CIT v.

Arooran Sugars Ltd. [State of\nT.N.\nv. Arooran Sugars Ltd., (1997) 1 SCC 326] the\nConstitution Bench, while dealing with the deeming\nprovision in a statute, ruled that the role of a provision\nin a statute creating legal fiction is well settled.\n\nReference was made to\nChief Inspector of Mines v.\nKaram Chand Thapar [Chief Inspector of Mines\nv.\nKaram Chand Thapar, AIR 1961 SC 838 : (1961) 2\nCri LJ 1], J.K.

ADM,\nAllahabad, (1995) 1 SCC 537] and eventually, it was\nheld that when a statute creates a legal fiction saying\nthat something shall be deemed to have been done\nwhich in fact and truth has not been done, the Court\nhas to examine and ascertain as to for what purpose\nand between which persons such a statutory fiction is\nto be resorted to and thereafter, the courts have to\ngive full effect to such a statutory fiction and it has to\nbe carried to its logical conclusion.\n\n38. From the aforesaid pronouncements, the principle\nthat can be culled out is that it is the bounden duty of\nthe court to ascertain for what purpose the legal\nfiction has been created. It is also the duty of the\ncourt to imagine the fiction with all real consequences\nand instances unless prohibited from doing so. That\napart, the use of the term “deemed” has to be read in\nits context and further, the fullest logical purpose and\nimport are to be understood. It is because in modern\nlegislation, the term “deemed” has been used for\nmanifold purposes. The object of the legislature has\nto be kept in mind.”\n\n77.\nIn\nHari Ram [State of U.P. v. Hari Ram\n, (2013) 4 SCC\n280 : (2013) 2 SCC (Civ) 583] , the Court has held that\n(SCC p. 293, para 18) in interpreting the provision creating\na legal fiction, the court is to ascertain for what purpose the\nfiction is created and after ascertaining the same, the court\nis to assume all those facts and consequences which are\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 440 of 567\n\nincidental or inevitable corollaries for giving effect to the\nfiction.”\n\n373) There is yet another angle from which the matter can be looked\n\ninto. In any case, when the Aadhaar scheme/project under the\n\nAct has been saved from the challenge to its constitutionality, we\n\nsee no reason to invalidate the enrolments which were made\n\nprior to the passing of this Act as it would lead to unnecessary\n\nburden and exercise of enrolling these persons all over again.\n\nInstead the problem can be solved by eliciting ‘consent’ of all\n\nthose persons who were enrolled prior to the passing of the Act.\n\nSince, we have held that enrolment is voluntary in nature, those\n\nwho specifically refuse to give the consent, they would be allowed\n\nto exit from Aadhaar scheme. After all, by getting Aadhaar card,\n\nan individual so enrolled is getting a form of identity card. It\n\nwould still be open to such an individual to make use of the said\n\nAadhaar number or not. Those persons who need to avail any\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service would need Aadhaar in any case. It\n\nwould not be proper to cancel their Aadhaar cards. If direction is\n\ngiven to invalidate all those enrolments which were made prior to\n\n2016 then such persons will have to undergo the rigours of\n\ngetting themselves enrolled all over again. On the other hand,\n\nthose who do not get any benefit of the nature prescribed under\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 441 of 567\n\nSection 7\nof the Act, it would always be open for them not to\n\nmake use of Aadhaar card or to make use of this card in a limited\n\nsense, namely, showing it as a proof of their identity, without\n\nundergoing any authentication process. Therefore, to a large\n\nextent, it does not harm this later category as well.\n\nWe, thus, uphold the validity of\nSection 59\n. As a corollary,\n\nAadhaar for the period from 2009 to 2016 also stands validated.\n\nLIMITED GOVERNMENT, GOOD GOVERNANCE,\nCONSTITUTIONAL TRUST AND CONSTITUTIONALISM\n\n374) Mr. Shyam Divan and Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned senior\n\ncounsel, submit that a fundamental feature of the Constitution is\n\nthe sovereignty of the people with limited government authority.\n\nThe Constitution limits governmental authority in various ways,\n\namongst them Fundamental Rights, the distribution of powers\n\namongst organs of the state and the ultimate check by way of\n\njudicial review.\nArticle 245\nof the Constitution of India is an\n\nexpress embodiment of the principle of limited government to the\n\nlegislature inasmuch as it subjects laws to the Constitution:\n\n“(1) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution,\nParliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the\nterritory of India, and the Legislature of a State may make\nlaws for the whole or any part of the State.”\n\n375) The concept of limited government is the underlying difference\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 442 of 567\n\nbetween a ‘Constitution’ and ‘Constitutionalism’. Mr. Shyam Divan\n\nrefers to the introductory chapter of his book Indian Constitutional\n\nLaw, Prof. M.P. Jain writes:\n\n“Modern political thought draws a distinction between\n‘Constitutionalism’ and ‘Constitution’. A country may have\nthe ‘Constitution’ but not necessary ‘Constitutionalism’. For\nexample, a country with a dictatorship, where the dictator’s\nword is law, can be said to have a ‘Constitution’ but not\n‘Constitutionalism’.\n\nThe underlying difference between the two concepts is that\na Constitution ought not merely to confer powers on the\nvarious organs of the government, but also seek to restrain\nthose powers. Constitutionalism recognises the need for\ngovernment but insists upon limitations being placed upon\ngovernmental powers. Constitutionalism envisages checks\nand balances and putting the powers of the legislature and\nthe executive under some restraints and not making them\nuncontrolled and arbitrary. Unlimited powers jeopardise\nfreedom of the people ... If the Constitution confers\nunrestrained power on either the legislature or the\nexecutive, it might lead to an authoritarian, oppressive\ngovernment... to preserve the basic freedoms of the\nindividual, and to maintain his dignity and personality, the\nConstitution should be permeated with ‘Constitutionalism’:\nit should have some in-built restrictions on the powers\nconferred by it on governmental organs.\n\n‘Constitutionalism’ connotes in essence limited government\nor a limitation on government. Constitutionalism is the\nantithesis of arbitrary powers…\n\n... As PROFESSOR VILE has remarked: “Western\ninstitutional theorists have concerned themselves with the\nproblems of ensuring that the exercise of governmental\npower...should be controlled in order that it should not itself\nbe destructive of the values it was intended to promote.”\n\n376) Mr. Divan then cited various paragraphs from the cases of State\n\nof M.P. v. Thakur Bharat Singh126, (1967) 2 SCR 454, Gobind v.\n\n126(1967) 2 SCR 454\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 443 of 567\n\nState of M.P.127, S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India128, Sub-\n\nCommittee on\nJudicial Accountability v. Union of India129\n,\nI.R.\n\nCoelho v. State of T.N.130\n,\nNandini Sundar v. State of\n\nChhattisgarh131\n, which have reiterated and upheld the principle of\n\nlimited governments and constitutionalism as a fundamental\n\nprinciple of our constitutional scheme.\n\n377) He submitted that limited government is also enshrined within our\n\nPreamble, which is the essence of the Constitution of India, and\n\nentitles every individual citizen and the citizenry collectively to\n\nlive, work, and enjoy their varied lives without being under the\n\ncontinuous gaze of the State. He cites Chelameswar, J. in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy wherein he observed:\n\n“The Constitution of any country reflects the aspirations\nand goals of the people of that country (…) The\nConstitution cannot be seen as a document written in ink to\nreplace one legal regime by another. It is a testament\ncreated for securing the goals professed in the Preamble.\nPart-III of the Constitution is incorporated to ensure\nachievement of the objects contained in the Preamble. ‘We\nthe People’ of this country are the intended beneficiaries of\nthe Constitution. Man is not a creature of the State. Life\nand liberty are not granted by the Constitution. Constitution\nonly stipulates the limitations on the power of the State to\ninterfere with our life and liberty. Law is essential to enjoy\nthe fruits of liberty; it is not the source of liberty and\nemphatically not the exclusive source.”\n\n127(1975) 2 SCC 148\n128(1987) 1 SCC 124\n129(1991) 4 SCC 699\n130(2007) 2 SCC 1\n131 (2011) 7 SCC 547\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 444 of 567\n\n378) The Directive Principles of State Policy also envisage a limited\n\ngovernment. Violation of fundamental rights cannot be justified by\n\nthe State on grounds of administrative convenience in meeting its\n\nobligations under the Directive Principles of State Policy.\n\nProtection of fundamental rights is essential for public welfare\n\ncontemplated under the Directive Principles of State Policy. This\n\nhas been upheld in various cases such as\nMinerva Mills Ltd. v.\n\nUnion of India132\n, where Y.V. Chandrachud, C.J observed:\n\n“57. (…) just as the rights conferred by Part III would be\nwithout a radar and a compass if they were not geared to\nan ideal, in the same manner the attainment of the ideals\nset out in Part IV would become a pretence for tyranny if\nthe price to be paid for achieving that ideal is human\nfreedoms.”\n\n379) Similarly, in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala133, S.M. Sikri,\n\nC.J., inter alia, held:\n\n“209. ...In my view that meaning would be appropriate\nwhich would enable the country to achieve a social and\neconomic revolution without destroying the democratic\nstructure of the Constitution and the basic inalienable rights\nguaranteed in Part III and without going outside the\ncontours delineated in the Preamble.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n299. I am unable to hold that these provisions show that\nsome rights are not natural or inalienable rights. As a\nmatter of fact, India was a party to the Universal\nDeclaration of Rights which I have already referred to and\nthat Declaration describes some fundamental rights as\n\n132 (1980) 3 SCC 625\n133 (1973) 4 SCC 225\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 445 of 567\n\ninalienable. Various decisions of this Court describe\nfundamental rights as ‘natural rights’ or ‘human rights’ ...”\n\n380) Mr. Divan quotes Seervai in his book Constitutional Law of\n\nIndia134: A Critical Commentary where he writes:\n\n“17.14... In India “Public Welfare” and “Welfare State”\nbecame in the language of the Chaldean Oracle, “God-\ngiven names of unexplained power”, which absolved\njudges from a critical examination of the nature of\nfundamental rights, and why they were made legally\nenforceable and the nature of directive principles and why\nthey were made legally unenforceable\n\nxx xx xx\n\n17.20...it is simply not true that persons entrusted with the\nduty of implementing the directives will strive in good faith\nto implement them according to the expectations of the\ncommunity.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nThe question then arises: What is the agency for bringing\nabout social and economic changes which would enable a\nwelfare state to be created? The answer is, legislative and\nexecutive power controlled by constitutional limitations\nincluding fundamental rights …\n\nxx xx xx\n\n17.30 ... the conferment of legally enforceable fundamental\nrights by our Constitution on persons, citizens and groups\nof persons was the most effective way of securing public\nwelfare...Anything which enables those objectives to be\nrealised as fully as is practicable must, broadly speaking,\nsubserve public welfare...However, the Preamble, and to a\nlarge extent, Fundamental Rights, enable us to say that our\nConstitution has rejected a totalitarian form of government\nin favour of a liberal democracy. The emphasis of the\nPreamble is on securing the dignity of the individual …\nH.M. Seervai, Constitutional Law of India: A Critical Commentary (N.M. Tripathi Private\nLimited, Bombay, 4th Ed., Vol. 2, 1993) at pages 1928-1937.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 446 of 567\n\nxx xx xx\n\n17.34 But can fundamental rights acting as limitations on\nlegislative and executive power secure public welfare as\nthe framers of our Constitution intended? The answer is\n“Yes”. For, when during the Emergency of 1975-77, almost\nall the fetters on legislative power became unenforceable,\nthe public welfare suffered gravely and our free democratic\nconstitution was twisted out of shape and came near to a\ndictatorship or a Police State ...”\n\n381) The principles of constitutional trust, constitutional morality and\n\ngood governance are also deeply intertwined with the principle of\n\nminimum government.\nIn\nManoj Narula v. Union of India135\n, the\n\nCourt, inter alia, held:\n\n“1. … Democracy, which has been best defined as the\ngovernment of the people, by the people and for the\npeople, expects prevalence of genuine orderliness, positive\npropriety, dedicated discipline and sanguine sanctity by\nconstant affirmance of constitutional morality which is the\npillar stone of good governance.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n75. The principle of constitutional morality basically means\nto bow down to the norms of the Constitution and not to act\nin a manner which would become violative of the rule of\nlaw or reflectible of action in an arbitrary manner. It actually\nworks at the fulcrum and guides as a laser beam in\ninstitution building. The traditions and conventions have to\ngrow to sustain the value of such a morality. The\ndemocratic values survive and become successful where\nthe people at large and the persons in charge of the\ninstitution are strictly guided by the constitutional\nparameters without paving the path of deviancy and\nreflecting in action the primary concern to maintain\ninstitutional integrity and the requisite constitutional\nrestraints. Commitment to the Constitution is a facet of\nconstitutional morality.”\n\n135 (2014) 9 SCC 1\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 447 of 567\n\nxx xx xx\n\n82. In a democracy, the citizens legitimately expect that the\nGovernment of the day would treat the public interest as\nthe primary one and any other interest secondary. The\nmaxim salus populi suprema lex, has not only to be kept in\nview but also has to be revered. The faith of the people is\nembedded in the root of the idea of good governance\nwhich means reverence for citizenry rights, respect for\nfundamental rights and statutory rights in any governmental\naction, deference for unwritten constitutional values,\nveneration for institutional integrity, and inculcation of\naccountability to the collective at large. It also conveys that\nthe decisions are taken by the decision-making authority\nwith solemn sincerity and policies are framed keeping in\nview the welfare of the people, and including all in a\nhomogeneous compartment. The concept of good\ngovernance is not a Utopian conception or an abstraction.\n\nIt has been the demand of the polity wherever democracy\nis nourished. The growth of democracy is dependent upon\ngood governance in reality and the aspiration of the people\nbasically is that the administration is carried out by people\nwith responsibility with service orientation.\n\n83. … The issue of constitutional trust arises in the context\nof the debate in the Constituent Assembly that had taken\nplace pertaining to the recommendation for appointment of\na Minister to the Council of Ministers. Responding to the\nproposal for the amendment suggested by Prof. K.T. Shah\nwith regard to the introduction of a disqualification of a\nconvicted person becoming a Minister, Dr B.R. Ambedkar\nhad replied: (CAD Vol. VII, p. 1160)\n\n“His last proposition is that no person who is\nconvicted may be appointed a Minister of the State.\nWell, so far as his intention is concerned, it is no\ndoubt very laudable and I do not think any Member of\nthis House would like to differ from him on that\nproposition. But the whole question is this: whether\nwe should introduce all these qualifications and\ndisqualifications in the Constitution itself. Is it not\ndesirable, is it not sufficient that we should trust the\nPrime Minister, the legislature and the public at large\nwatching the actions of the Ministers and the actions\nof the legislature to see that no such infamous thing is\ndone by either of them?I think this is a case which\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 448 of 567\n\nmay eminently be left to the good sense of the Prime\nMinister and to the good sense of the legislature with\nthe general public holding a watching brief upon\nthem. I therefore say that these amendments are\nunnecessary.”\n\n382) It is submitted by Mr. Divan that the Aadhaar project is destructive\n\nof limited government, constitutionalism and constitutional trust.\n\nThe Constitution is not about the power of the State, but about\n\nthe limits on the power of the State. Post Aadhaar, the State will\n\ncompletely dominate the citizen and alter the relationship\n\nbetween citizen and State. The features of a Totalitarian State is\n\nseen from:\n\n(a) A person cannot conduct routine activities such as operating\n\na bank account, holding an investment in mutual funds, receiving\n\ngovernment pension, receiving scholarship, receiving food\n\nrations, operating a mobile phone without the State knowing\n\nabout these activities.(Sections 7, 32 and 57 of the Aadhaar Act).\n\n(b) The State can build a profile of the individual based on the\n\ntrail of authentication from which the nature of the citizen’s activity\n\ncan be determined. (Sections 2(d) and 32 of the Aadhaar Act and\n\nRegulation 20\n,\nand\nof the Aadhaar (Authentication)\n\nRegulation, 2016.\n\n(c) By disabling Aadhaar the State can cause the civil death of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 449 of 567\n\nthe person.(Sections 23(2)(g) of the Aadhaar Act and Regulation\n\n27 and 28 of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Updates) Act, 2016).\n\n(d) By making Aadhaar compulsory for other activities such as\n\nair travel, rail travel, directorship in companies, services and\n\nbenefits extended by State governments and municipal\n\ncorporations etc. there will be virtually no zone of activity left\n\nwhere the citizen is not under the gaze of the State. This will have\n\na chilling effect on the citizen.\n\n(e) In such a society, there is little or no personal autonomy.\n\nThe State is pervasive, and dignity of the individual stands\n\nextinguished.\n\n(f) This is an inversion of the accountability in the Right to\n\nInformation age: instead of the State being transparent to the\n\ncitizen, it is the citizen who is rendered transparent to the State.\n\n383) Mr. Sibal also added that accountability of governments and the\n\nstate is a phenomenon which is accepted across the world. In\n\nfurtherance of the Right to information Act, 2005 was passed\n\nintended to ensure transparency and state accountability.\n\nThrough Aadhaar, on the other hand, the state seeks\n\ntransparency and accountability of an individual’s multifarious\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 450 of 567\n\nactivities in the course of his everyday life. This fundamentally\n\nalters the relationship between the citizen and the State and\n\nskews the balance of power in favour of the State, which is\n\nanathema to the Constitution.\n\n384) There is no dispute about the exposition of the principles of\n\nlimited government and good governance, etc., as highlighted by\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners and noted above.\n\nWe may add that we are the Republic and it becomes the\n\nduty of the Court to keep it. That can be achieved by asking the\n\nstakeholders to follow the Constitution, which we have. There are\n\nsix key constitutional notions, a brilliant exposition whereof has\n\nbeen provided in the case of\nManoj Narula v. Union of India136\n.\n\nThe idea of constitutional renaissance was first sounded in\nthe\n\nsaid judgment\n.\n\nIt is further elaborated in the case of\nGovernment\n\nof NCT of Delhi v. Union of India137\nin the opinion penned down by\n\none of us138. It stands severally described now as “a constant\n\nawakening as regards the text, context, perspective, purpose,\n\nand the rule of law”, an awakening that makes space for a\n\n“resurgent constitutionalism” and “allows no room for absolutism”\n\nnor any “space for anarchy”. It is held, therein the term “rational\n\n136 (2014) 9 SCC 1\n137 (2018) SCC Online SC 661\n138 Dipak Misra, CJI\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 451 of 567\n\nanarchism” has “no entry in the field of constitutional governance\n\nor the rule of law” and by the same token constitutional text and\n\ncontext resolutely repudiate the lineages of absolutism or the\n\nitineraries of dictatorship. One may then say that\n\n“constitutionalism” is the space between “absolutism” and\n\n“anarchy” and its constant repair and renewal is the prime\n\nfunction of adjudication.\n\n385) In an illuminating Article titled ‘A Constitutional Renaissance’ on\n\nthe aforesaid verdict authored by Prof. Upendra Baxi 139, the\n\nlearned Professor has made following pertinent comments:\n\n“Awakening is a constant process; renaissance has a\nbeginning but knows no end because everyday fidelity to\nthe vision, spirit and letter of the Constitution is the\nsupreme obligation of all constitutional beings. One ought\nto witness in daily decisions an “acceptance of\nconstitutional obligations” not just within the text of the\nConstitution but also its “silences”. To thus reawaken is to\nbe “obeisant to the constitutional conscience with a sense\nof constitutional vision”. Second, courts should adopt that\napproach to interpretation which “glorifies the democratic\nspirit of the Constitution”. “Reverence” for the Constitution\n(or constitutionalism) is the essential first step towards\nconstitutional renaissance. Third, people are the true\nsovereigns, never to be reduced to the servile status of\nbeing a subject; rather as beings with rights, they are the\nsource of trust in governance and founts of legitimacy. The\nrelatively autonomous legislative, executive, administrative\nand adjudicatory powers are legitimate only when placed at\nthe service of constitutional ends. All forms of public power\nare held in trust. And political power is not an end but a\nmeans to constitutional governance.”\n\n139 Published in The Indian Express on July 16, 2018\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 452 of 567\n\n386) Since the arguments on limited government advanced by Mr.\n\nShyam Divan were the same as advanced by him during the\n\nhearing of Binoy Viswam, our purpose would be served by\n\nreproducing the following discussion from\nthe said judgment\n:\n\n“85. There cannot be any dispute about the manner in\nwhich Mr Shyam Divan explained the concept of “limited\nGovernment” in his submissions. Undoubtedly, the\nConstitution of India, as an instrument of governance of the\nState, delineates the functions and powers of each wing of\nthe State, namely, the Legislature, the Judiciary and the\nExecutive. It also enshrines the principle of separation of\npowers which mandates that each wing of the State has to\nfunction within its own domain and no wing of the State is\nentitled to trample over the function assigned to the other\nwing of the State. This fundamental document of\ngovernance also contains principle of federalism wherein\nthe Union is assigned certain powers and likewise powers\nof the State are also prescribed. In this context, the Union\nLegislature i.e. Parliament, as well as the State\nLegislatures are given specific areas in respect of which\nthey have power to legislate. That is so stipulated in\nSchedule VII to the Constitution wherein List I enumerates\nthe subjects over which Parliament has the dominion, List II\nspells out those areas where the State Legislatures have\nthe power to make laws while List III is the Concurrent List\nwhich is accessible both to the Union as well as the State\nGovernments. The scheme pertaining to making laws by\nParliament as well as by the legislatures of the State is\nprimarily contained in\nArticles 245\nto 254 of the\nConstitution. Therefore, it cannot be disputed that each\nwing of the State has to act within the sphere delineated for\nit under the Constitution. It is correct that crossing these\nlimits would render the action of the State ultra vires the\nConstitution. When it comes to power of taxation,\nundoubtedly, power to tax is treated as sovereign power of\nany State. However, there are constitutional limitations\nbriefly described above.\n\n86.\nIn a nine Judge Bench decision of this Court in\nJindal\nStainless Ltd. & Anr. v. State of Haryana & Ors.\ndiscussion\non these constitutional limitations are as follows:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 453 of 567\n\n“20. Exercise of sovereign power is, however, subject\nto Constitutional limitations especially in a federal\nsystem like ours where the States also to the extent\npermissible exercise the power to make laws including\nlaws that levy taxes, duties and fees. That the power\nto levy taxes is subject to constitutional limitations is\nno longer res-integra. A Constitution Bench of this\nCourt has in\nSynthetics and Chemicals Ltd. v. State of\nU.P.\n(1990) 1 SCC 109 recognised that in India the\nCentre and the States both enjoy the exercise of\nsovereign power, to the extent the Constitution confers\nupon them that power. This Court declared:\n\n“56 … We would not like, however, to\nembark upon any theory of police power\nbecause the Indian Constitution does not\nrecognise police power as such. But we must\nrecognise the exercise of Sovereign power\nwhich gives the State sufficient authority to\nenact any law subject to the limitations of the\nConstitution to discharge its functions.\nHence, the Indian Constitution as a\nsovereign State has power to legislate on all\nbranches except to the limitation as to the\ndivision of powers between the Centre and\nthe States and also subject to the\nfundamental rights guaranteed under the\nConstitution. The Indian States, between the\nCentre and the States, has sovereign power.\nThe sovereign power is plenary and inherent\nin every sovereign State to do all things\nwhich promote the health, peace, morals,\neducation and good order of the people.\n\nSovereignty is difficult to define. This power\nof sovereignty is, however, subject to\nconstitutional limitations.”This power,\naccording to some constitutional authorities,\nis to the public what necessity is to the\nindividual. Right to tax or levy impost must be\nin accordance with the provisions of the\nConstitution.”\n\n21. What then are the Constitutional limitations on the\npower of the State legislatures to levy taxes or for that\nmatter enact legislations in the field reserved for them\nunder the relevant entries of List II and III of the\nSeventh Schedule. The first and the foremost of these\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 454 of 567\n\nlimitations appears in\nArticle 13\nof the Constitution of\nIndia which declares that all laws in force in the\nterritory of India immediately before the\ncommencement of the Constitution are void to the\nextent they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part\nIII dealing with the fundamental rights guaranteed to\nthe citizens. It forbids the States from making any law\nwhich takes away or abridges, any provision of Part III.\n\nAny law made in contravention of the said rights shall\nto the extent of contravention be void. There is no gain\nsaying that the power to enact laws has been\nconferred upon the Parliament subject to the above\nConstitutional limitation. So also in terms of\nArticle\n, the residuary power to impose a tax not\notherwise mentioned in the Concurrent List or the\nState List has been vested in the Parliament to the\nexclusion of the State legislatures, and the States'\npower to levy taxes limited to what is specifically\nreserved in their favour and no more.\n\n22.\nArticle 249\nsimilarly empowers the Parliament to\nlegislate with respect to a matter in the State List for\nnational interest provided the Council of States has\ndeclared by a resolution supported by not less than\ntwo-thirds of the members present and voting that it is\nnecessary or expedient in national interest to do so.\nThe power is available till such time any resolution\nremains in force in terms of\nArticle 249(2)\nand the\nproviso thereunder.\n\n23.\nArticle 250\nis yet another provision which\nempowers the Parliament to legislate with respect to\nany matter in the State List when there is a\nproclamation of emergency. In the event of an\ninconsistency between laws made by Parliament\nunder\nArticles 249\nand\n, and laws made by\nlegislature of the States, the law made by Parliament\nshall, to the extent of the inconsistency, prevail over\nthe law made by the State in terms of\nArticle 251.\n\n24. The power of Parliament to legislate for two or more\nStates by consent, in regard to matters not otherwise within\nthe power of the Parliament is regulated by\nArticle 252\n,\nwhile\nArticle 253\nstarting with a non-obstante clause\nempowers Parliament to make any law for the whole\ncountry or any part of the territory of India for implementing\nany treaty, agreement or convention with any other country\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 455 of 567\n\nor countries or any decision made at any international\nconference, association or other body.”\n\n87. Mr. Divan, however, made an earnest endeavour to\nfurther broaden this concept of ‘limited Government’ by\ngiving an altogether different slant. He submitted that there\nare certain things that the States simply cannot do because\nthe action fundamentally alters the relationship between\nthe citizens and the State. In this hue, he submitted that it\nwas impermissible for the State to undertake the exercise\nof collection of bio-metric data, including fingerprints and\nstoring at a central depository as it puts the State in an\nextremely dominant position in relation to the individual\ncitizens. He also submitted that it will put the State in a\nposition to target an individual and engage in surveillance\nthereby depriving or withholding the enjoyment of his rights\nand entitlements, which is totally impermissible in a country\nwhere governance of the State of founded on the concept\nof ‘limited Government’. Again, this concept of limited\ngovernment is woven around\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.\n\n88. Undoubtedly, we are in the era of liberalised\ndemocracy. In a democratic society governed by the\nConstitution, there is a strong trend towards the\nconstitutionalisation of democratic politics, where the\nactions of democratically elected Government are judged in\nthe light of the Constitution. In this context, judiciary\nassumes the role of protector of the Constitution and\ndemocracy, being the ultimate arbiter in all matters\ninvolving the interpretation of the Constitution.”\n\n387) We may observe that the matter is examined keeping in view the\n\nfundamental principles of constitutionalism in mind, and more\n\nparticularly the principle that the concept of ‘limited government’\n\nis applicable having regard to the fact that the three limbs of the\n\nState are to act within the framework of a written Constitution\n\nwhich assigns specific powers to each of the wing of the State\n\nand this presupposes that the sovereign power of the Parliament\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 456 of 567\n\nis circumscribed by the provisions of the Constitution and the\n\nlegislature is supposed to Act within the boundaries delineated by\n\nthe Constitution. The constitutionalism, which is the bedrock of\n\nrule of law, is to be necessarily adhered to by the Parliament.\n\nFurther, the power of judicial review which is accorded to the\n\ncourts can be exercised to strike down any legislation or\n\nexecutive action if it is unconstitutional.\n\n388) When we examine this issue in the context of discussion on\n\nvarious issues already dealt with, it is difficult to agree with the\n\nsweeping proposition advanced by the petitioners that the\n\nAadhaar project is destructive of limited government and\n\nconstitutional trust. These submissions are premised on the\n\narchitecture of the Aadhaar being constitutionally intrusive which\n\nthreatens the autonomy of individuals and has a tendency of\n\ncreating a surveillance state. In support, the petitioners have\n\nreferred to certain provisions of the Aadhaar Act. Some\n\nprovisions which we found offending are struck down, some\n\nothers have been read down and some are tweaked with. We\n\nfeel that the statutory regime that would now govern the citizenry,\n\nwards off such a danger, if any.\n\nMONEY BILL\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 457 of 567\n\nIs the Aadhaar Act a validly enacted law having been passed as\na Money Bill?\n\n389) Mr. Chidambaram and Mr. Datar had laid attack on the Act on the\n\nground that the Bill it could not have been introduced and passed\n\nby the Parliament as Money Bill. It was argued that the Aadhaar\n\n(Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and\n\nServices) Bill, 2016 (for short the ‘Bill’) was wrongly certified as\n\nMoney Bill under\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution of India by the\n\nHon’ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha, thereby, virtually excluding\n\nthe Rajya Sabha from the legislative process and depriving the\n\nHon’ble President of his power of return. This, according to them,\n\nis illegal and grossly violates the constitutional provisions.\n\n390) It was submitted that Bills are of three kinds:\n\n(i) Ordinary Bills (\nArticle 107\n);\n\n(ii) Financial Bills viz. subset of Ordinary Bills (\nArticle 117\n);\n\n(iii) Money Bill viz. subset of Financial Bills (\nArticle 110\n).\n\n391)\nArticle 110\nreads as under:\n\n“Article 110 - Definition of \"Money Bills\".-\n\n(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a Bill shall be deemed\nto be a Money Bill if it contains only provisions dealing with\nall or any of the following matters, namely:--\n\n(a) the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or\nregulation of any tax;\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 458 of 567\n\n(b) the regulation of the borrowing of money or the giving of\nany guarantee by the Government of India, or the\namendment of the law with respect to any financial\nobligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the\nGovernment of India;\n\n(c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the\nContingency Fund of India, the payment of moneys into or\nthe withdrawal of moneys from any such Fund;\n\n(d) the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated\nFund of India;\n\n(e) the declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure\ncharged on the Consolidated Fund of India or the\nincreasing of the amount of any such expenditure;\n\n(f) the receipt of money on account of the Consolidated\nFund of India or the public account of India or the custody\nor issue of such money or the audit of the accounts of the\nUnion or of a State; or\n\n(g) any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in\nsub-clauses (a) to (f).\n\n(2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason\nonly that it provides for the imposition of fines or other\npecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees\nfor licenses or fees for services rendered, or by reason that\nit provides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration\nor regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for\nlocal purposes.\n\n(3) If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or\nnot, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People\nthereon shall be final.\n\n(4) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is\ntransmit led to the Council of States under\narticle 109\n, and\nwhen it is presented to the President for assent under\n\narticle 111\n, the certificate of the Speaker of the House of\nthe People signed by him that it is a Money Bill.”\n\n392) It was submitted that a Money Bill may provide for matters\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 459 of 567\n\nenumerated in Clause (a) to (f) of\nArticle 110.\nClause (g) has\n\nbeen added because it may be necessary to include provisions\n\nthat are only “incidental” to any of matters specified in (a) to (f).\n\nThe learned counsel pointed out the distinguishing features of a\n\nMoney Bill are as below:\n\n(i) It shall be introduced only on the recommendation of\n\nPresident (\nArticle 117(1)\n).\n\n(ii) It shall be introduced only in the House of the People\n\n(\nArticle 117(1)\n, 109(1)\n).\n\n(iii) A Money Bill is transmitted by the Lok Sabha to the Rajya\n\nSabha. Rajya Sabha thereafter may only make recommendations\n\nand return the Bill and not make amendments. The\n\nrecommendations may or may not be accepted by the Lok\n\nSabha. If the Money Bill is not returned within 14 days, it is\n\ndeemed to have been passed by both the Houses. (\nArticle 109(2)\n\nto\nArticle 109(5)\n).\n\n(iv) Upon submission of a Money Bill to the President for his\n\nassent, the President cannot return the Money Bill with the\n\nmessage requesting that the Houses will reconsider the Bill\n\n(proviso to\nArticle 111\n).\n\nHence, it is manifest that a Money Bill that a Money Bill is a\n\nspecial kind of Bill that has the effect of denuding the power of the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 460 of 567\n\nRajya Sabha of its power to amend the Bill and depriving the\n\nPresident of his power to return the bill for reconsideration. On\n\nthat premise, it was argued that the provisions of a Money Bill\n\nmust be construed very strictly and narrowly and only if a Bill falls\n\nstrictly under definition of a Money Bill (\nArticle 110\n), it can be\n\npassed as a Money Bill. If the provisions of the Bill fall outside\n\nthe strict definition of Money Bill, the said Bill cannot be passed\n\nas a Money Bill.\n\n393) Great emphasis was laid on the word ‘only’ appearing in\nArticle\nwhich signified that to qualify as a Money Bill, it has to strictly\n\nfall within one or more of the clauses of\nArticle 110.\nFor the\n\ninterpretation of the word ‘only’, reference was made to the\n\njudgment in the case of\nHari Ram & Ors. v. Babu Gokul\n\nPrasad140\n:\n\n“3.\nSection 166\nof M.P. Land Revenue Code, 1954 reads\nas under:\n\n“166. Any person who holds land for agricultural\npurposes from a tenure holder and who is not an\noccupancy tenant under\nSection 169\nor a protected\nlessee under the Berar Regulation of Agricultural\nLeases Act, 1951, shall be ordinary tenant of such\nland.\n\nExplanation.— For the purposes of this section —\n\n140(1991) Supp. 2 SCC 608\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 461 of 567\n\n(i) any person who pays lease money in respect of\nany land in the form of crop share shall be deemed to\nhold such land;\n\n(ii) any person who cultivates land in partnership with\nthe tenure holder shall not be deemed to hold such\nland;\n\n(iii) any person to whom only the right to cut grass or\nto graze cattle or to grow singhara (Trapa bispinosa)\nor to propagate or collect lac is granted in any land\nshall not be deemed to hold such land for agricultural\npurposes.”\n\nA bare perusal of the section indicates that any tenant\nother than occupancy tenant if he held the land for\nagricultural purposes from a tenure holder, then he became\nordinary tenant by operation of law. Doubt if any stood\nremoved by the explanation which clarifies the class of\npersons who could be deemed to be covered under a\ntenant other than occupancy tenant. Since it has been\nfound that the land was let out to appellant not only for the\nright to cut grass, he could not be held to be a person who\nwas not holding the land for agricultural purposes. The\nword ‘only’ in Explanation (iii) is significant. It postulates\nthat entire land should have been used for the purposes\nenumerated. If part of the land was used for cultivation,\nthen the land could not be deemed to have been granted\nfor cutting grass only. It has been found that out of 5 and\nodd acres of land, the land under cultivation was 2 acres.\n\nTherefore, the negative clause in Explanation (iii) did not\napply and the appellant became ordinary tenant under\n\nSection 166\n. In 1959, M.P. Land Revenue Code was\nenacted and\nSection 185\nprovided for the persons who\ncould be deemed to be occupancy tenants. Its relevant part\nis extracted below:\n\n“185. Occupancy tenants.— (1) Every person who at\nthe coming into force of this Code holds—\n\n(i) in the Mahakoshal Region—\n\n(a) ***\n\n(b) ***\n\n(c) any land as an ordinary tenant as defined in the\nMadhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code, 1954 (2 of\n1955);”\n\n394) The learned counsel also referred to M/s. Saru Smelting (P) Ltd.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 462 of 567\n\nv. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Lucknow141:\n\n“3. The contention of the respondent is that Phosphorous\nBronze is an alloy containing not only the metals\nmentioned in the aforesaid entry but Phosphorous also and\nas such it is not covered under the aforesaid entry. The\nwords “other alloy containing any of these metals only”\nmean that the alloy made of these metals i.e. copper, tin,\nnickel or zinc only and that alone is covered under the said\nentry. It was submitted that if any other metal or substance\nis included in such an alloy, the same would not be covered\nunder the aforesaid entry.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n5. We were referred to various dictionary meanings of the\nwords ‘Phosphorous Bronze’ which have been noticed by\nthe learned Judge dealing with the case in the High Court.\n\nWe are really concerned with the interpretation of the entry.\nThe emphasis in the entry is — either it should be pure\ncopper, tin, nickel or zinc and if it is an alloy containing two\nor more metals, it must be an alloy containing these metals\nonly. The expression “only” is very material for\nunderstanding the meaning of the entry. Since the alloy in\ndispute contains Phosphorous, may be in a very small\nquantity, it cannot fall within Entry 2(a) of the aforesaid\nNotification. The appeal consequently fails and is\ndismissed with costs.”\n\n395) In order to demonstrate as to what would be the nature and\n\nscope of the Money Bill, reference was made to the following\n\nliterature:\n\n“RELEVANT EXCERPTS FROM ERSKINE MAY’S\n“PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE”\n\nDefinition of Money Bill –\n\nSection 1(2)\nof the Act defines a ‘Money Bill’ as a public bill\nwhich in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of\nCommons contains only provisions dealing with all or any\nof the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal,\nremission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the\nimposition for the payment of debt or other financial\n141(1993) Supp. 3 SCC 97\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 463 of 567\n\npurposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund or the\nnational Loans Fund, or on money provided by Parliament\nor the variation or repeal of any such charges; Supply; the\nappropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts\nof public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the\nrepayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to\nthose subjects or any of them. For the purposes of this\ndefinition the expressions ‘taxation’, ‘public money’, and\n‘loan’ respectively do not include any taxation, money, or\nloan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes,\nmatters which, on the other hand, are included within the\nscope of Commons financial privilege.\n\nPROCEDURE IN PASSING MONEY BILL\n\nA ‘Money Bill’ which has been passed by the House of\nCommons and sent up to the House of Lords at least one\nmonth before the end of the session, but is not passed by\nthe House of Lords without amendment within one month\nafter it is so sent up, is, unless the House of Commons\ndirect to the contrary, to be presented for the Royal Assent\nand becomes an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent\nbeing signified to it. A ‘Money Bil’, when it is sent up to the\nHouse of Lords and when it is presented to Her Majesty,\nmust be endorsed with the Speaker’s certificate that it is\nsuch a bill. Before giving this certificate the Speaker is\ndirected to consult, if practicable, those two members of\nthe Panel of Chairs who are appointed for the purpose at\nthe beginning of each session by the Committee of\nSelection.\n\nWhen the Speaker has certified a bill to be a ‘Money Bill’\nthis is recorded in the Journal; and Section 3 of the\nParliament Act 1911 stipulates that such certificate is\nconclusive for all purposes and may not be questioned in a\ncourt of law.\n\nNo serious practical difficulty normally arises in deciding\nwhether a particular bill is or is not a ‘Money Bill’; and\ncriticism has seldom been voiced of the Speaker’s action in\ngiving or withholding a certificate. A bill which contains any\nof the enumerated matters and nothing besides is\nindisputably a ‘Money bill’. If it contains any other matters,\nthen, unless these are ‘subordinate matters incidental to’\nany of the enumerated matters so contained in the bill, the\nbill is not a ‘Money bill’. Furthermore, even if the main\nobject of a bill is to create a new charge on the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 464 of 567\n\nConsolidated Fund or on money provided by Parliament,\nthe bill will not be certified if it is apparent that the primary\npurpose of the new charge is not purely financial.”\n\nTHE PARLIAMENTARY ACT, 1911\n\nChapter 13 of the Parliament Act, 1911 wherein Money Bill\nis defined as under:\n\n“(1) …\n\n(2) A Money Bill means a Public Bill which in the opinion of\nthe Speaker of the House of Commons contains only\nprovisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects,\nnamely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or\nregulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of\ndebt or other financial purposes of charges on the\nConsolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament,\nor the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the\nappropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts\nof public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the\nrepayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to\nthose subjects or any of them. In this subsection the\nexpressions “taxation”, “public money”, and “loan”\nrespectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan\nraised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.\n\n(3) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is\nsent up to the House of Lords and when it is presented to\nHis Majesty for assent the certificate of the Speaker of the\nHouse of Commons signed by him that it is a Money Bill.\n\nBefore giving his certificate, the Speaker shall consult, if\npracticable, two members to be appointed from the\nChairmen’s Panel at the beginning of each Session by the\nCommittee of Selection.”\n\nRELEVANT EXCERPTS FROM THE CONSTITUTION OF\nIRELAND\n\n(1) A Money Bill means a Bill which contains only\nprovisions dealing with all or any of the following matters,\nnamely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration or\nregulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of\ndebt or other financial purposes of charges on public\nmoneys or the variation or repeal of any such charges;\nsupply, the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of\naccounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 465 of 567\n\nloan or the repayment thereof; matters subordinate and\nincidental to these matters or any of them.\n\n(2) In this definition the expressions “taxation”, “public\nmoney” and “loan” respectively do not include any taxation,\nmoney or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local\npurposes.\n\nRELEVANT EXCERPTS FROM KAUL & SHAKDER’S\n“PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE OF PARLIAMENT”, LOK\nSABHA SECRETARIAT AT INDIA\n\nSpeaker Mavalankar observed as follows:\n\n“Prima facie, it appears to me that the words of\n\narticle 110 (imposition\n, abolition, remission, alteration,\nregulation of any tax) are sufficiently wide to make the\nConsolidated Bill a Money Bill. A question may arise as to\nwhat is the exact significance or scope of the word ‘only’\nand whether and how far that word goes to modify or\ncontrol the wide and general words ‘imposition, abolition,\nremission, etc.’.\n\nI think, prima facie, that the word ‘only’ is not\nrestrictive of the scope of the general terms. If a Bill\nsubstantially deals with the imposition, abolition, etc., of a\ntax, then the mere fact of the inclusion in the Bill of other\nprovisions which may be necessary for the administration\nof that tax or, I may say, necessary for the achievement of\nthe objective of the particular Bill, cannot take away the Bill\nfrom the category of Money Bills. One has to look to the\nobjective of the bill. Therefore, if the substantial provisions\nof the Bill aim at imposition, abolition, etc., of any tax then\nthe other provisions would be incidental and their inclusion\ncannot be said to take it away from the category of a\nMoney Bill. Unless one construes the word ‘only’ in this\nway it might lead to make\narticle 110\na nullity. No tax can\nbe imposed without making provisions for its assessment,\ncollection, administration, reference to courts or tribunals,\netc, one can visualise only one section in a Bill imposing\nthe main tax and there may be fifty other sections which\nmay deal with the scope, method, manner, etc., of that\nimposition.\n\nFurther, we have also to consider the provisions of\nsub-clause (2) of\narticle 110;\nand these provisions may be\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 466 of 567\n\nhelpful to clarify the scope of the word ‘only’, not directly\nbut indirectly.”\n\n396) It was further submitted that though clause (3) of\nArticle 110\n\nstipulates that decision of the Speaker on whether a Bill is a\n\nMoney Bill or not is final, that did not mean that it was not subject\n\nto the judicial scrutiny and, therefore, in a given case, the Court\n\nwas empowered to decide as to whether decision of the Speaker\n\nwas constitutionally correct. In respect of Bill in question, it was\n\nargued that though\nSection 7\nstates that subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices shall be provided from Consolidated Fund of India which\n\nwas an attempt to give it a colour of Money Bill, some of the other\n\nprovisions, namely, clauses 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57 of the Bill\n\n(which corresponds to Sections 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57 of the\n\nAadhaar Act) do not fall under any of the clauses of\nArticle 110\nof\n\nthe Constitution. Therefore, some provisions which were other\n\nthan those covered by Money Bill and, therefore, introduction of\n\nthe Bill as Money Bill was clearly inappropriate. It was also\n\nargued that, in this scenario, entire Act was bound to fail as there\n\nis no provision for severing clauses in Indian Constitution, unlike\n\nSection 55\nof the Australian Constitution. Insofar as justiciability\n\nof the Speaker’s decision is concerned, following judgments were\n\nreferred to:\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 467 of 567\n\n(i) Sub-Committee on\nJudicial Accountability v. Union of\n\nIndia & Ors.142\n\n(\nii) S.R. Bommai & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.143\n\n(iii) Raja Ram Pal v. Hon’ble Speaker, Lok Sabha & Ors.144\n\n(\niv) Ramdas Athawale v. Union of India & Ors.145\n\n(\nv) Kihoto Hollohan v. Zachillhu & Ors.146\n\n397) It was emphasised that the creation and composition of the Rajya\n\nSabha (Upper House) is an indicator of, and is essential to,\n\nconstitutional federalism. It is a part of basic structure of the\n\nConstitution as held in\nKuldip Nayar & Ors. v. Union of India &\n\nOrs.147\n. Therefore, Rajya Sabha could not have been by-passed\n\nwhile passing the legislation in question and doing away with this\n\nprocess and also right of the President to return the Bill has\n\nrendered the statute unconstitutional.\n\n398) The learned Attorney General as well as Mr. Dwivedi and some\n\nother counsel appearing for respondents refuted the aforesaid\n\nsubmissions in a strongest manner possible. It was argued that\n\nthe Bill was rightly characterised as a Money Bill and introduced\n\nunder\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution. According to them, the\n142(1991) 4 SCC 699\n143(1994) 3 SCC 1\n144(2007) 3 SCC 184\n145(2010) 4 SCC 1\n146(1992) Supp. 2 SCC 651\n147(2006) 7 SCC 1\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 468 of 567\n\nheart of the Aadhaar Act is\nSection 7\n. It is not the creation of\n\nAadhaar number per se which is the core of the Act, rather, that is\n\nonly a means to identify the correct beneficiary and ensure\n\n“targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services”, the\n\nexpenditure for which is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of\n\nIndia. A conjoint reading of the preamble to the Act along with\n\nSection 7\nclearly discloses the legislative intent and the object of\n\nthe Act, which is to ensure that subsidy, benefit or service for\n\nwhich expenditure is incurred from or the receipt therefrom forms\n\npart of, the Consolidated Fund of India should be targeted to\n\nreach the intended beneficiary. It was argued, without prejudice\n\nto the above, that the decision of the Speaker incorporated into a\n\ncertificate sent to the President is final and cannot be the subject\n\nmatter of judicial review. To support the aforesaid proposition,\n\nreference was made to the judgment in the case of\nMohd. Saeed\n\nSiddiqui v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.148\nwherein the Court held\n\nas under:\n\n“7. Leave granted in the special leave petition. This appeal\nis directed against the order dated 27-8-2012 passed by\nthe Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature of\nAllahabad in Mukul Upadhyay v. N.K. Mehrotra [Civil Misc.\nWrit Petition No. 24905 of 2012 (Writ-C 24905 of 2012),\norder dated 27-8-2012 (All)] whereby the High Court, while\nallowing the amendment application to the writ petition and\nholding the writ petition to be maintainable, directed to list\nthe petition on 27-9-2012 for hearing on merits. By way of\n\n148(2014) 11 SCC 415\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 469 of 567\n\nthe said amendment application, the writ petitioner sought\nto add two grounds in the writ petition viz. the Amendment\nAct is violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India\nand the same was wrongly introduced as a Money Bill in\nclear disregard to the provisions of\nArticle 199\nof the\nConstitution of India. Accordingly, it was prayed to issue a\nwrit, order or direction in the nature of mandamus declaring\nthe Amendment Act as ultra vires the provisions of the\nConstitution of India.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n12. It was further submitted by Mr Venugopal that the\nAmendment Act was not even passed by the State\nLegislature in accordance with the provisions of the\nConstitution of India and is, thus, a mere scrap of paper in\nthe eye of the law. The Bill in question was presented as a\nMoney Bill when, on the face of it, it could never be called\nas a Money Bill as defined in\nArticles 199(1)\nand\n199(2)\nof\nthe Constitution of India. Since the procedure for an\nordinary Bill was not followed and the assent of the\nGovernor was obtained to an inchoate and incomplete Bill\nwhich had not even gone through the mandatory\nrequirements under the Constitution of India, the entire\naction was unconstitutional and violative of\nArticle 200\nof\nthe Constitution of India.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n31. The main apprehension of the petitioner is that the Bill\nthat led to the enactment of the Amendment Act was\npassed as a Money Bill in violation of\nArticles 197\nand\nof the Constitution of India which should have been passed\nby both the Houses viz. U.P. Legislative Assembly and U.P.\nLegislative Council and was wrongly passed only by the\nU.P. Legislative Assembly. During the course of hearing, Mr\nDesai, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of\nU.P., placed the original records pertaining to the\nproceedings of the Legislative Assembly, decision of the\nSpeaker as well as the Governor, which we are going to\ndiscuss in the latter part of our judgment.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n34. The above provisions make it clear that the finality of\nthe decision of the Speaker and the proceedings of the\nState Legislature being important privilege of the State\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 470 of 567\n\nLegislature viz. freedom of speech, debate and\nproceedings are not to be inquired by the courts. The\n“proceeding of the legislature” includes everything said or\ndone in either House in the transaction of the parliamentary\nbusiness, which in the present case is enactment of the\nAmendment Act. Further,\nArticle 212\nprecludes the courts\nfrom interfering with the presentation of a Bill for assent to\nthe Governor on the ground of non-compliance with the\nprocedure for passing Bills, or from otherwise questioning\nthe Bills passed by the House. To put it clear, proceedings\ninside the legislature cannot be called into question on the\nground that they have not been carried on in accordance\nwith the Rules of Business. This is also evident from\nArticle\nwhich speaks about the powers, privileges of the\nHouses of the Legislature and of the members and\ncommittees thereof.\n\n35. We have already quoted\nArticle 199.\nIn terms of\nArticle\n199(3)\n, the decision of the Speaker of the Legislative\nAssembly that the Bill in question was a Money Bill is final\nand the said decision cannot be disputed nor can the\nprocedure of the State Legislature be questioned by virtue\nof\nArticle 212.\n\nWe are conscious of the fact that in the\ndecision of this Court in\nRaja Ram Pal v. Lok Sabha\n\n[(2007) 3 SCC 184] , it has been held that the proceedings\nwhich may be tainted on account of substantive or gross\nirregularity or unconstitutionality are not protected from\njudicial scrutiny.\n\n36. Even if it is established that there was some infirmity in\nthe procedure in the enactment of the Amendment Act, in\nterms of Article 255 of the Constitution the matters of\nprocedure do not render invalid an Act to which assent has\nbeen given by the President or the Governor, as the case\nmay be.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n43. As discussed above, the decision of the Speaker of the\nLegislative Assembly that the Bill in question was a Money\nBill is final and\nthe said decision\ncannot be disputed nor\ncan the procedure of the State Legislature be questioned\nby virtue of\nArticle 212.\nFurther, as noted earlier,\nArticle 252\n\nalso shows that under the Constitution the matters of\nprocedure do not render invalid an Act to which assent has\nbeen given by the President or the Governor, as the case\nmay be. Inasmuch as the Bill in question was a Money Bill,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 471 of 567\n\nthe contrary contention by the petitioner against the\npassing of the said Bill by the Legislative Assembly alone is\nunacceptable.”\n\n399) It was submitted that the challenge on identical grounds was,\n\nthus, repelled in the aforesaid case wherein validity of legislative\n\nenactment of a State in question, on the same ground, namely, it\n\ncould not called Money Bill as defined in\nArticle 199\nof the\n\nConstitution, which was pari materia with\nArticle 110\nof the\n\nConstitution qua the Parliament. Judgment in the case of\n\nYogendra Kumar Jaiswal & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors.149\nwas\n\nalso referred to wherein the Court was concerned with\nOrissa\n\nSpecial Courts Act, 2006\nwhich was also passed as Money Bill\n\nand was challenged as violative of\nArticle 199\nof the Constitution.\n\nIt was argued that the Court held in this case that decision of the\n\nSpeaker that the Bill in question is a Money Bill is final and such a\n\ndecision cannot be disputed nor can the procedure of the state\n\nlegislature can be questioned by virtue of\nArticle 212\nof the\n\nConstitution. The learned Attorney General specifically read out\n\nthe following portion from\nthe said judgment\n:\n\n“42. In this regard, we may profitably refer to the authority\nin Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui v. State of U.P. [Mohd. Saeed\nSiddiqui v. State of U.P., (2014) 11 SCC 415], wherein a\nthree-Judge Bench while dealing with such a challenge,\nheld that\nArticle 212\nprecludes the courts from interfering\nwith the presentation of a Bill for assent to the Governor on\n\n149(2016) 3 SCC 183\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 472 of 567\n\nthe ground of non-compliance with the procedure for\npassing Bills, or from otherwise questioning the Bills\npassed by the House, for proceedings inside the legislature\ncannot be called into question on the ground that they have\nnot been carried on in accordance with the Rules of\nBusiness. Thereafter, the Court referring to\nArticle 199(3)\n\nruled that the decision of the Speaker of the Legislative\nAssembly that the Bill in question was a Money Bill is final\nand the said decision cannot be disputed nor can the\nprocedure of the State Legislature be questioned by virtue\nof\nArticle 212.\n\nThe Court took note of the decision in\nRaja\nRam Pal [Raja Ram Pal v. Lok Sabha\n, (2007) 3 SCC 184]\nwherein it has been held that the proceedings which may\nbe tainted on account of substantive or gross irregularity or\nunconstitutionality are not protected from judicial scrutiny.\nEventually, the Court repelled the challenge.\n\n43.\nIn our considered opinion, the authorities cited by the\nlearned counsel for the appellants do not render much\nassistance, for the introduction of a Bill, as has been held\nin\nMohd. Saeed Siddiqui [Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui v. State of\nU.P.\n, (2014) 11 SCC 415] , comes within the concept of\n“irregularity” and it does come within the realm of\nsubstantiality. What has been held in Special Reference\nNo. 1 of 1964 [Powers, Privileges and Immunities of State\nLegislatures, In re, Special Reference No. 1 of 1964, AIR\n1965 SC 745] has to be appositely understood. The factual\nmatrix therein was totally different than the case at hand as\nwe find that the present controversy is wholly covered by\nthe pronouncement in Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui [Mohd.\n\nSaeed Siddiqui v. State of U.P.\n, (2014) 11 SCC 415] and\nhence, we unhesitatingly hold that there is no merit in the\nsubmission so assiduously urged by the learned counsel\nfor the appellants.”\n\n400) Reliance was also placed on three judgments of Constitution\n\nBench of this Court150. The learned Attorney General also\n\nsubmitted that even if it is presumed that there is illegality of\n\nprocedure in the conduct of business in the Parliament, such\n\n150Mangalore Ganesh Beedi Works v. State of Mysore & Anr.\n, 1963 Supp (1) SCR 275;\nRamdas\nAthawale v. Union of India & Ors.\n, (2010) 4 SCC 1, and;\nM.S.M. Sharma v. Dr. Shree Krishna\nSinha & Ors.\n, AIR 1960 SC 1186\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 473 of 567\n\nparliamentary proceedings were immune from challenge.\n\nAttention of the Court was also drawn to\nArticle 122\n, which\n\nprohibits any proceedings of Parliament being called in question\n\non the ground of “any alleged irregularity of procedure”. It was\n\nsubmitted that the decision and certification of the Speaker being\n\na matter of procedure is included in the Chapter under the heads\n\n“Legislative Procedure” being\nArticles 107\nto 111, “Procedure in\n\nFinancial Matters” being\nArticles 112\nto 117 and “Procedure\n\nGenerally” being\nArticle 118\nto 122 placing beyond doubt that\n\nseparation of powers is embedded in these provisions clearly\n\nexcluding judicial review in matters of procedure. Submission\n\nwas that if this is clearly a Money Bill, being placed beyond\n\nchallenge in a Court of Law, then to term it as a Financial Bill as\n\ncontended by the petitioners would be wholly unjustified. Dilating\n\nthe aforesaid proposition, it was pointed out that in the Draft\n\nConstitution prepared by the drafting committee,\nArticle 101\n\nprovided for immunity of Parliamentary proceedings from judicial\n\nintervention on ‘alleged irregularity of procedure’. This article\n\nfinally got renumbered as\nArticle 122\nin the Constitution of India.\n\nDuring the Constituent Assembly debates, Shri H.V. Kamath\n\nsuggested an amendment to draft\nArticle 101\nto clarify that the\n\nvalidity of any Parliamentary proceedings shall not be called in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 474 of 567\n\nquestion in any court. Accordingly, he suggested that the words\n\n‘called in question’ be replaced with ‘called in question in any\n\ncourt’. Refuting this suggested amendment, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\n\ncategorically stated:\n\n“Sir, with regard to the amendment of Mr. Kamath, I do not\nthink it is necessary, because where can the proceedings\nof Parliament be questioned in a legal manner except in a\ncourt? Therefore the only place where the proceedings of\nParliament can be questioned in a le-gal manner and legal\nsanction obtained is the Court. Therefore it is unnecessary\nto mention the words which Mr. Kamath wants in his\namendment. For the reason I have explained, the only\nforum there the proceedings can be questioned in a\nlegal manner and legal relief obtained either against\nthe President or the Speaker or any officer or Member,\nbeing the Court, it is unnecessary to specify the forum.\nMr. Kamath will see that the marginal note makes it clear.”\n\n401) Support of the judgment rendered by Patna High Court in\nPatna\n\nZilla Truck Owners Association & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors.151\n\nwas also taken, which has been approved by the Constitution\n\nBench judgment of this Court in\nState of Punjab v. Sat Pal Dang\n\n& Ors.152\n. It was also argued that the legal position was similar in\n\nother Parliamentary democracies like Australia and Canada.\n\n402) In any case, argued the learned Attorney General and Mr.\n\nDwivedi, the Bill was rightly introduced as Money Bill as it merited\n\nsuch a description in law as well. To buttress this submission,\n\ndoctrine of pith and substance was invoked as a guiding test. It\n151AIR 1963 Pat 16\n152(1969) 1 SCR 478\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 475 of 567\n\nwas argued that\nSection 7\nwhich was the heart and soul of the\n\nAadhaar Act fulfilled this requirement as the subsidies, benefits\n\nand services, the expenditure of which is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India. Therefore, conditions\nlaid down in\n\nArticle 110\nwere fully satisfied. Following judgments 153 explaining\n\nthe doctrine of pith and substance were pressed into substance.\n\nIt was submitted that undoubtedly in pith and substance, the\n\nobject of the Aadhaar Act is to identify the correct beneficiaries\n\nand ensure the “targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices”, the expenditure for which is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India. The creation of the Aadhaar number\n\nand authentication facility are in furtherance of the object of the\n\nAadhaar Act, which is permissible under\nArticle 110(g).\nIt was\n\nalso argued that\nSection 57\n, which has been attacked as being\n\nuntraceable to any of the sub-clauses of (a) to (f) of\nArticle 110\n\ncannot be looked at in isolation. This Bill in its pith and substance\n\nshould pass the test of being a Money Bill and not isolated\n\nprovisions. On the contrary,\nSection 57\nof the Act is also\n\nincidental to the object of the Act and creates a limitation upon\n\nuse of Aadhaar by private parties wherein even though nothing\n\nprevents them from using Aadhaar for other purposes, the same\n\n153A.S. Krishna v. State of Madras\n, (1957) SCR 399;\nUnion of India & Ors. v. Shah Goverdhan L.\nKabra Teachers’ College\n, (2002) 8 SCC 228, and;\nP.N. Krishna Lal & Ors. v. Government of\nKerala & Anr.\n, 1995 Supp (2) SCC 187\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 476 of 567\n\nhas been subjected to the procedure and obligations of\nSection\n, which requires, inter alia, informed consent of the Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder, purpose limitation, i.e. the identity information will\n\nbe used only for submission to CIDR for authentication and the\n\nprivate entity must provide alternatives to submission of such\n\nidentity information, which, in other words, means that private\n\nparties cannot insist upon Aadhaar and make Aadhaar\n\nmandatory, unless required by law. Therefore,\nSection 57\nis a\n\nlimitation imposed under the Aadhaar Act on the use of Aadhaar\n\nnumber by private parties which is purely incidental to the object\n\nof the Act and would squarely fall within\nArticle 110(g)\nof the\n\nConstitution.\n\n403) At the outset, we would like to recognise the importance of Rajya\n\nSabha (Upper House) in a bicameral system of the Parliament.\n\nThe significance and relevance of the Upper House has been\n\nsuccinctly exemplified by this Court in Kuldip Nayar’s case in the\n\nfollowing words:\n\n“74. The growth of “bicameralism” in parliamentary forms\nof Government has been functionally associated with the\nneed for effective federal structures. This nexus between\nthe role of “Second Chambers” or Upper Houses of\nParliament and better coordination between the Central\nGovernment and those of the constituent units, was\nperhaps first\nlaid down in\ndefinite terms with the\nConstitution of the United States of America, which was\nratified by the thirteen original States of the Union in the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 477 of 567\n\nyear 1787. The Upper House of the Congress of USA,\nknown as the Senate, was theoretically modelled on the\nHouse of Lords in the British Parliament, but was totally\ndifferent from the latter with respect to its composition and\npowers.\n\n75. Since then, many nations have adopted a bicameral\nform of Central Legislature, even though some of them are\nnot federations. On account of colonial rule, these British\ninstitutions of parliamentary governance were also\nembodied in the British North America Act, 1867 by which\nthe Dominion of Canada came into existence and the\nConstitution of India, 1950. In Canada, Parliament consists\nof the House of Commons and the Senate (the Upper\nHouse). Likewise, the Parliament of the Union of India\nconsists of the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the\nRajya Sabha (Council of States, which is the Upper\nHouse). In terms of their functions as agencies of\nrepresentative democracies, the Lower Houses in the\nlegislatures of India, USA and Canada, namely, the Lok\nSabha, the House of Representatives and the House of\nCommons broadly follow the same system of composition.\n\nAs of now, Members of the Lower Houses are elected from\npre-designated constituencies through universal adult\nsuffrage. The demarcation of these constituencies is in\naccordance with distribution of population, so as to accord\nequity in the value of each vote throughout the territory of\nthe country. However, with the existence of constituent\nStates of varying areas and populations, the representation\naccorded to these States in the Lower House becomes\nhighly unequal. Hence, the composition of the Upper\nHouse has become an indicator of federalism, so as to\nmore adequately reflect the interests of the constituent\nStates and ensure a mechanism of checks and balances\nagainst the exercise of power by Central authorities that\nmight affect the interests of the constituent States.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n79. The genesis of the Indian Rajya Sabha on the other\nhand benefited from the constitutional history of several\nnations which allowed the Constituent Assembly to\nexamine the federal functions of an Upper House.\nHowever, “bicameralism” had been introduced to the\nprovincial legislatures under the British rule in 1921.\nThe\nGovernment of India Act, 1935\nalso created an Upper\nHouse in the federal legislature, whose members were to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 478 of 567\n\nbe elected by the members of provincial legislatures and in\ncase of Princely States to be nominated by the rulers of\nsuch territories. However, on account of the realities faced\nby the young Indian Union, a Council of States (the Rajya\nSabha) in the Union Parliament was seen as an essential\nrequirement for a federal order. Besides the former British\nprovinces, there were vast areas of Princely States that\nhad to be administered under the Union. Furthermore, the\ndiversity in economic and cultural factors between regions\nalso posed a challenge for the newly-independent country.\nHence, the Upper House was instituted by the Constitution-\nframers which would substantially consist of members\nelected by the State Legislatures and have a fixed number\nof nominated members representing non-political fields.\nHowever, the distribution of representation between the\nStates in the Rajya Sabha is neither equal nor entirely\nbased on population distribution. A basic formula is used to\nassign relatively more weightage to smaller States but\nlarger States are accorded weightage regressively for\nadditional population. Hence the Rajya Sabha incorporates\nunequal representation for States but with proportionally\nmore representation given to smaller States. The theory\nbehind such allocation of seats is to safeguard the interests\nof the smaller States but at the same time giving adequate\nrepresentation to the larger States so that the will of the\nrepresentatives of a minority of the electorate does not\nprevail over that of a majority.\n\n80. In India,\nArticle 80\nof the Constitution of India\nprescribes the composition of the Rajya Sabha. The\nmaximum strength of the House is 250 members, out of\nwhich up to 238 members are the elected representatives\nof the States and the Union Territories [\nArticle 80(1)(b)]\n,\nand\nmembers are nominated by the President as\nrepresentatives of non-political fields like literature,\nscience, art and social services [\nArticles 80(1)(a)\nand\n\n80(3)].\nThe members from the States are elected by the\nelected members of the respective State Legislative\nAssemblies as per the system of proportional\nrepresentation by means of the single transferable vote\n[\nArticle 80(4)].\nThe manner of election for representatives\nfrom the Union Territories has been left to prescription by\nParliament [\nArticle 80(5)].\nThe allocation of seats for the\nvarious States and Union Territories of the Indian Union is\nenumerated in the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution,\nwhich is read with\nArticles 4(1)\nand\n80(2).\nThis allocation\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 479 of 567\n\nhas obviously varied with the admission and reorganisation\nof States.”\n\n404) The Rajya Sabha, therefore, becomes an important institution\n\nsignifying constitutional fedaralism. It is precisely for this reason\n\nthat to enact any statute, the Bill has to be passed by both the\n\nHouses, namely, Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha. It is the\n\nconstitutional mandate. The only exception to the aforesaid\n\nParliamentary norm is\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nHaving regard to this overall scheme of bicameralism enshrined\n\nin our Constitution, strict interpretation has to be accorded to\n\nArticle 110.\nKeeping in view these principles, we have\n\nconsidered the arguments advanced by both the sides.\n\n405) We would also like to observe at this stage that insofar as\n\nsubmission of the respondents about the justiciability of the\n\ndecision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha is concerned, we are\n\nunable to subscribe to such a contention. Judicial review would\n\nbe admissible under certain circumstances having regard to the\n\nlaw\nlaid down by\nthis Court in various judgments which have\n\nbeen cited by Mr. P. Chidambaran, learned senior counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioners, and taken note of in paragraph 396.\n\n406) From the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties as\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 480 of 567\n\ntaken note of above, it is clear that the petitioners accept that\n\nSection 7 of the Aadhaar Act has the elements of ‘Money Bill’.\n\nThe attack is on the premise that some other provisions, namely,\n\nclauses 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57 of the Bill (which corresponds\n\nto Sections 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57 of the Aadhaar Act) do not\n\nfall under any of the clauses of\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution and,\n\ntherefore, Bill was not limited to only those subjects mentioned in\n\nArticle 110.\nInsofar as\nSection 7\nis concerned, it makes receipt of\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service subject to establishing identity by the\n\nprocess of authentication under Aadhaar or furnish proof of\n\nAadhaar etc. It is also very clearly declared in this provision that\n\nthe expenditure incurred in respect of such a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice would be from the Consolidated Fund of India. It is also\n\naccepted by the petitioners that\nSection 7\nis the main provision of\n\nthe Act. In fact, Introduction to the Act as well as the Statement\n\nof Objects and Reasons very categorically record that the main\n\npurpose of Aadhaar Act is to ensure that such subsidies, benefits\n\nand services reach those categories of persons, for whom they\n\nare actually meant.\nSections 2(f)\n, (w) and (x) of the Aadhaar Act\n\ndefine benefit, service and subsidy respectively. These\n\nprovisions read as under:\n\n“2(f) “benefit” means any advantage, gift, reward, relief, or\npayment, in cash or kind, provided to an individual or a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 481 of 567\n\ngroup of individuals and includes such other benefits as\nmay be notified by the Central Government;\n\n2(w) “service” means any provision, facility, utility or any\nother assistance provided in any form to an individual or a\ngroup of individuals and includes such other services as\nmay be notified by the Central Government;\n\n2(x) “subsidy” means any form of aid, support, grant,\nsubvention, or appropriation, in cash or kind, to an\nindividual or a group of individuals and includes such other\nsubsidies as may be notified by the Central Government.”\n\n407) As all these three kinds of welfare measures are sought to be\n\nextended to the marginalised section of society, a collective\n\nreading thereof would show that the purpose is to expand the\n\ncoverage of all kinds of aid, support, grant, advantage, relief\n\nprovisions, facility, utility or assistance which may be extended\n\nwith the support of the Consolidated Fund of India with the\n\nobjective of targeted delivery. It is also clear that various\n\nschemes which can be contemplated by the aforesaid provisions,\n\nrelate to vulnerable and weaker section of the society. Whether\n\nthe social justice scheme would involve a subsidy or a benefit or\n\na service is merely a matter of the nature and extent of\n\nassistance and would depend upon the economic capacity of the\n\nState. Even where the state subsidizes in part, whether in cash\n\nor kind, the objective of emancipation of the poor remains the\n\ngoal.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 482 of 567\n\n408) The respondents are right in their submission that the expression\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service ought to be understood in the context\n\nof targeted delivery to poorer and weaker sections of society. Its\n\nconnotation ought not to be determined in the abstract. For as an\n\nabstraction one can visualize a subsidy being extended by\n\nParliament to the King; by Government to the Corporations or\n\nBanks; etc. The nature of subsidy or benefit would not be the\n\nsame when extended to the poor and downtrodden for producing\n\nthose conditions without which they cannot live a life with dignity.\n\nThat is the main function behind the Aadhaar Act and for this\n\npurpose, enrolment for Aadhaar number is prescribed in Chapter\n\nII which covers\nSections 3\nto\n. Residents are, thus, held entitled\n\nto obtain Aadhaar number. We may record here that such an\n\nenrolment is of voluntary nature. However, it becomes\n\ncompulsory for those who seeks to receive any subsidy, benefit\n\nor service under the welfare scheme of the Government\n\nexpenditure whereof is to be met from the Consolidated Fund of\n\nIndia. It follows that authentication under\nSection 7\nwould be\n\nrequired as a condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service\n\nonly when such a subsidy, benefit or service is taken care of by\n\nConsolidated Fund of India. Therefore,\nSection 7\nis the core\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 483 of 567\n\nprovision of the Aadhaar Act and this provision satisfies the\n\nconditions of\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution. Upto this stage,\n\nthere is no quarrel between the parties.\n\n409) In this context, let us examine provisions of Sections 23(2)(h),\n\n54(2)(m) and 57 of the Aadhaar Act. Insofar as\nSection 23\nis\n\nconcerned, it deals with powers and functions of the Authority.\n\nSub-section (1) thereof says that the Authority shall develop the\n\npolicy, procedure and systems for issuing Aadhaar numbers to\n\nindividuals and perform authentication thereof under this Act. As\n\nmentioned above, under Section 3 of the Aadhaar Act, Aadhaar\n\nnumber is to be issued and authentication is performed under\n\nSection 8 of the Aadhaar Act. Sub-section (2) stipulates certain\n\nspecified powers and functions which the Authority may perform\n\nand sub-section (h) thereof reads as under:\n\n“23(2)(h) specifying the manner of use of Aadhaar\nnumbers for the purposes of providing or availing of various\nsubsidies, benefits, services and other purposes for which\nAadhaar numbers may be used.”\n\n410) This provision, thus, enables the Authority to specify the manner\n\nof use of Aadhaar with specific purpose in mind, namely, for\n\nproviding or availing of various subsidies, benefits and services.\n\nThese are relatable to\nSection 7\n. However, it uses the\n\nexpression ‘other purposes’ as well. The expression ‘other\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 484 of 567\n\npurposes’ can be read ejusdem generis which would have its\n\nrelation to subsidies, benefits and services as mentioned in\n\nSection 7\nand it can be confined only to that purpose i.e. scheme\n\nof targeted delivery for giving any grant, relief etc. when it is\n\nchargeable to Consolidated Fund of India. Therefore, this\n\nprovision, according to us, can be read as incidental to the main\n\nprovision and would be covered by\nArticle 110(g)\nof the\n\nConstitution.\nSection 54\nconfers power upon the Authority to\n\nmake regulations consistent with the Act and rules made\n\nthereunder, for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Clause (m)\n\nof sub-section (2) of\nSection 54\nrelates to\nSection 23(2)(h)\nas can\n\nbe seen from its language.\n\n“54(2)(m) the manner of use of Aadhaar numbers for the\npurposes of providing or availing of various subsidies,\nbenefits, services and other purposes for which Aadhaar\nnumbers may be used under clause (h) of sub-section (2)\nof\nsection 23\n.”\n\n411) The interpretation which we have given to\nSection 23(2)(h)\nwould\n\napply here as well and, therefore, we do not find any problem\n\nwith this provision also. Coming to Section 57 of the Aadhaar\n\nAct, it mentions that Aadhaar Act would not prevent use of\n\nAadhaar number for other purposes under the law. It is only an\n\nenabling provision as it permits the use of Aadhaar number for\n\nother purposes as well. This provision is to be viewed in the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 485 of 567\n\nbackdrop that\nSection 7\nis the core provision. We have already\n\nheld that it has substantial nexus with the appropriation of funds\n\nfrom the Consolidated Fund of India and is directly connected\n\nwith\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution. To facilitate this, UIDAI is\n\nestablished as Authority under the Act which performs various\n\nfunctions including that of a regulator needing funds for staff\n\nsalary and it’s own expenses. Respondents have rights\n\nremarked that the Authority is the performer in chief, the\n\npredominant dramatis personae. It appoints Registrars, enrollers,\n\nREs and ASAs; it lays down device and software specifications,\n\nand develops softwares too; it enrols; it de-duplicates; it\n\nestablishes CIDR and manages it; it authenticates; it inspects; it\n\nprosecutes; it imposes disincentives; etc. And all this it does\n\nbased on funds obtained by appropriations from Consolidated\n\nFund of India (\nSection 24\n).\n\n412) When we examine the provision of\nSection 57\nin the aforesaid\n\nbackdrop, as stated above, it only enables holder of Aadhaar\n\nnumber to use the said number for other purposes as well. That\n\nwould not take away or dilute the sheen of clause 7 (now Section\n\n7) for which purposes the Bill was introduced as Money Bill. In\n\nany case, a part of\nSection 57\nhas already declared\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 486 of 567\n\nunconstitutional whereby even a body corporate in private sector\n\nor person may seek authentication from the Authority for\n\nestablishing the identity of an individual.\n\nFor all the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion that Bill\n\nwas rightly introduced as Money Bill. Accordingly, it is not\n\nnecessary for us to deal with other contentions of the petitioners,\n\nnamely, whether certification by the Speaker about the Bill being\n\nMoney Bill is subject to judicial review or not, whether a provision\n\nwhich does not relate to Money Bill is severable or not. We\n\nreiterate that main provision is a part of Money Bill and other are\n\nonly incidental and, therefore, covered by clause (g) of\nArticle 110\n\nof the Constitution.\n\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961:\n\n413) The Division Bench of this Court in Binoy Viswam has already\n\nupheld the validity of\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961\n\nby repelling the contention predicated on\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. No doubt, in\nthe said judgment\n, the Court\n\nheld that insofar as scope of judicial review of legislative act is\n\nconcerned, it is available on two grounds, namely:\n\n(i) The Act is not within the competence of the legislature\n\nwhich passed the law, and/or\n\n(ii) It is in contravention of any fundamental rights stipulated in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 487 of 567\n\nPart III of the Constitution or any other rights/provisions of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n414) We have already acknowledged the existence of third ground as\n\npointed out in\nShayara Bano\ncase, namely, ‘manifest\n\narbitrariness’.\nAn Act\nwhich is manifestly arbitrary would be\n\nunreasonable and contrary to rule of law and, therefore, violative\n\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. Even when we consider the\n\nprovisions of\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 from\n\nthis point of view, it cannot be said that the provision suffers from\n\nthe vice of manifest arbitrariness. On the contrary, in Binoy\n\nViswam itself, the benevolent purpose for inserting such a\n\nprovision as a bona fide move has been highlighted. Therefore,\n\nthe provision needs this test as well. In this behalf, the Court\n\nobserved:\n\n“101. The varying needs of different classes or sections of\npeople require differential and separate treatment. The\nlegislature is required to deal with diverse problems arising\nout of an infinite variety of human relations. It must,\ntherefore, necessarily have the power of making laws to\nattain particular objects and, for that purpose, of\ndistinguishing, selecting and classifying persons and things\nupon which its laws are to operate. The principle of equality\nof law, thus, means not that the same law should apply to\neveryone but that a law should deal alike with all in one\nclass; that there should be an equality of treatment under\nequal circumstances. It means that equals should not be\ntreated unlike and unlikes should not be treated alike. Likes\nshould be treated alike.”\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 488 of 567\n\n415) Since the issue as to whether right to privacy is a facet of\n\nfundamental rights or not was pending before the Constitution\n\nBench, the challenge to\nSection 139AA\nwas not examined in the\n\ncontext of privacy rights, specifically\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution\n\nthough this aspect was argued. The Division Bench observed in\n\nthis behalf, as under:\n\n“136. Subject to the aforesaid, these writ petitions are\ndisposed of in the following manner:\n\n136.1. We hold that Parliament was fully competent to\nenact\nSection 139-AA\nof the Act and its authority to make\nthis law was not diluted by the orders of this Court.\n\n136.2. We do not find any conflict between the provisions\nof the Aadhaar Act and\nSection 139-AA\nof the Income Tax\nAct inasmuch as when interpreted harmoniously, they\noperate in distinct fields.\n\n136.3.\nSection 139-AA\nof the Act is not discriminatory nor it\noffends equality clause enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n136.4.\nSection 139-AA\nis also not violative of\nArticle 19(1)\n\n(g) of the Constitution insofar as it mandates giving of\nAadhaar enrolment number for applying for PAN cards, in\nthe income tax returns or notified Aadhaar enrolment\nnumber to the designated authorities. Further, the proviso\nto sub-section (2) thereof has to be read down to mean that\nit would operate only prospectively.\n\n136.5. The validity of the provision upheld in the aforesaid\nmanner is subject to passing the muster of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution, which is the issue before the Constitution\nBench in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 and other\nconnected matters. Till then, there shall remain a partial\nstay on the operation of the proviso to sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 139-AA\nof the Act, as described above. No costs.”\n\n416) The nine Judge Bench has already, since then, answered the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 489 of 567\n\nreference by holding that right to privacy is a fundamental right.\n\nHaving regard to that, validity of\nSection 139AA\nof the Act needs\n\nto be tested on this ground.\n\n417) As already explained above, the Constitution Bench has held that\n\nin K.S. Puttaswamy though privacy is a fundamental right inter\n\nalia traceable to the right to liberty enshrined in\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution, it is not an absolute right but subject to limitations.\n\nThe Court also laid down the triple test which need to be satisfied\n\nfor judging the permissible limits for invasion of privacy while\n\ntesting the validity of any legislation. These are:\n\n(a) The existence of a law.\n\n(b) A “legitimate State interest”; and\n\n(c) Such law should pass the “test of proportionality”.\n\n418) In the present case, there is no dispute that first requirement\n\nstands satisfied as\nSection 139AA\nis a statutory provision and,\n\ntherefore, there is a backing of law. Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned\n\nASG had argued that not only other two requirements are also\n\nsatisfied, rather these have been specifically dealt with by the\n\nDivision Bench in Binoy Viswam inasmuch as these aspects were\n\neluded to, consider, examined and the Court recorded its findings\n\non these aspects. We find force in this submission of Mr. Mehta.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 490 of 567\n\nInsofar as requirement of ‘legitimate State interest’ is concerned,\n\nhe pointed out that though Nariman, J. provided for a lenient test,\n\nnamely, ‘larger public interest’ as against ‘legitimate State\n\ninterest’, the provision satisfies both the tests. We agree with his\n\nsubmission, as\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 seeks\n\nto safeguard the following interest:\n\n“To prevent income tax evasion by requiring, through an\namendment to the\nIncome Tax Act\n, that the Aadhaar\nnumber be linked with the PAN.”\n\n419) The mandatory requirement of quoting/producing PAN number is\n\ngiven in Rule 114 and the Form 49A. While mandating that\n\n“every person”, (the term “person” as defined under\nSection 2(31)\n\nof the Act), shall apply for and get a PAN, the legislature also\n\nprovided for the requirement so as to how such number will be\n\ngiven to every “person” in Rule 114 of the Income Tax Rules, the\n\nrelevant part of which is Rule 114(1). While complying with the\n\nmandatory requirement (which have been in existence since\n\n1989) and that for all “persons”, many facts were required to be\n\ndisclosed and such disclosure was/is in public interest including\n\ndemographic details and biometrics i.e. left thumb\n\nimpression/signature.\n\n420) The Parliament, considering the “legitimate State interest” as well\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 491 of 567\n\nas the “larger public interest” has now introduced\nSection 139AA\n\nwhich is only an extension of\nSection 139A\nwhich requires linking\n\nof PAN number with Aadhaar number which is issued under the\n\nAct for the purpose of eliminating duplicate PANs from the system\n\nwith the help of a robust technology solution. Therefore, those\n\nwho have PAN number and have already provided the\n\ninformation required to get PAN number cannot claim to have any\n\nlegitimate expectation of withholding any data required for\n\nAadhaar under the ground of “privacy”.\n\n421) The respondents have demonstrated with empirical data, in the\n\ncommon additional affidavit of respondent Nos. 1 and 3 the\n\nexistence of the “legitimate State interest” and “larger public\n\ninterest”. Being a unique identifier, the problem of bogus or\n\nduplicate PANs can be dealt with in a more systematic and full-\n\nproof manner (though, in the context of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution, but at the same time, relevant from the perspective\n\nof legitimate State interest also). Discussion on this aspect, in\n\nBinoy Viswam, proceeds as under:\n\n“60.2. PAN is the key or identifier of all computerised\nrecords relating to the taxpayer. The requirement for\nobtaining of PAN is mandated through\nSection 139-A\nof the\nAct. The procedure for application for PAN is prescribed in\nRule 114 of the Rules. The forms prescribed for PAN\napplication are Forms 49-A and 49-AA for Indian and\nforeign citizens/entities. Quoting of PAN has been\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 492 of 567\n\nmandated for certain transactions above specified\nthreshold value in Rule 114-B of the Rules.\n\n60.3. For achieving the objective of one PAN to one\nassessee, it is required to maintain uniqueness of PAN.\n\nThe uniqueness of PAN is achieved by conducting a de-\nduplication check on all already existing allotted PAN\nagainst the data furnished by new applicant. Under the\nexisting system of PAN only demographic data is captured.\nDe-duplication process is carried out using a phonetic\nalgorithm whereby a Phonetic PAN (PPAN) is created in\nrespect of each applicant using the data of applicant's\nname, father's name, date of birth, gender and status. By\ncomparison of newly generated PPAN with existing set of\nPPANs of all assessees duplicate check is carried out and\nit is ensured that same person does not acquire multiple\nPANs or one PAN is not allotted to multiple persons. Due to\nprevalence of common names and large number of PAN\nholders, the demographic way of de-duplication is not\nfoolproof. Many instances are found where multiple PANs\nhave been allotted to one person or one PAN has been\nallotted to multiple persons despite the application of\nabovementioned de-duplication process. While allotment of\nmultiple PANs to one person has the risk of diversion of\nincome of person into several PANs resulting in evasion of\ntax, the allotment of same PAN to multiple persons results\nin wrong aggregation and assessment of incomes of\nseveral persons as one taxable entity represented by\nsingle PAN.\n\n60.4. Presently verification of original documents in only\n0.2% cases (200 out of 1,00,000 PAN applications) is done\non a random basis which is quite less. In the case of\nAadhaar, 100% verification is possible due to availability of\nonline Aadhaar authentication service provided by the\nUIDAI. Aadhaar seeding in PAN database will make PAN\nallotment process more robust.\n\n60.5. Seeding of Aadhaar number into PAN database will\nallow a robust way of de-duplication as Aadhaar number is\nde-duplicated using biometric attributes of fingerprints and\niris images. The instance of a duplicate Aadhaar is almost\nnon-existent. Further seeding of Aadhaar will allow the\nIncome Tax Department to weed out any undetected\nduplicate PANs. It will also facilitate resolution of cases of\none PAN allotted to multiple persons.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 493 of 567\n\nxx xx xx\n\n104. Insofar as the impugned provision is concerned, Mr\nDatar had conceded that first test that of reasonable\nclassification had been satisfied as he conceded that\nindividual assessees form a separate class and the\nimpugned provision which targeted only individual\nassessees would not be discriminatory on this ground. His\nwhole emphasis was that\nSection 139-AA\nof the Act did not\nsatisfy the second limb of the twin tests of classification as,\naccording to him, this provision had no rational nexus with\nthe object sought to be achieved. In this behalf, his\nsubmission was that if the purpose of the provision was to\ncurb circulation of black money, such an object was not\nachievable by seeding PAN with Aadhaar inasmuch as\nAadhaar is only for individuals. His submission was that it\nis only the individuals who are responsible for generating\nblack money or money laundering. This was the basis for\nMr Datar's submission. We find it somewhat difficult to\naccept such a submission.\n\n105. Unearthing black money or checking money\nlaundering is to be achieved to whatever extent possible.\nVarious measures can be taken in this behalf. If one of the\nmeasures is introduction of Aadhaar into the tax regime, it\ncannot be denounced only because of the reason that the\npurpose would not be achieved fully. Such kind of menace,\nwhich is deep-rooted, needs to be tackled by taking\nmultiple actions and those actions may be initiated at the\nsame time. It is the combined effect of these actions which\nmay yield results and each individual action considered in\nisolation may not be sufficient. Therefore, rationality of a\nparticular measure cannot be challenged on the ground\nthat it has no nexus with the objective to be achieved. Of\ncourse, there is a definite objective. For this purpose alone,\nindividual measure cannot be ridiculed. We have already\ntaken note of the recommendations of SIT on black money\nheaded by Justice M.B. Shah. We have also reproduced\nthe measures suggested by the Committee headed by\nChairman, CBDT on “Measures to Tackle Black Money in\nIndia and Abroad”. They have, in no uncertain terms,\nsuggested that one singular proof of identity of a person for\nentering into finance/business transactions, etc. may go a\nlong way in curbing this foul practice. That apart, even if\nsolitary purpose of de-duplication of PAN cards is taken\ninto consideration, that may be sufficient to meet the\nsecond test of\nArticle 14.\nIt has come on record that 11.35\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 494 of 567\n\nlakh cases of duplicate PAN or fraudulent PAN cards have\nalready been detected and out of this 10.52 lakh cases\npertain to individual assessees. Seeding of Aadhaar with\nPAN has certain benefits which have already been\nenumerated. Furthermore, even when we address the\nissue of shell companies, fact remains that companies are\nafter all floated by individuals and these individuals have to\nproduce documents to show their identity. It was sought to\nbe argued that persons found with duplicate/bogus PAN\ncards are hardly 0.4% and, therefore, there was no need to\nhave such a provision. We cannot go by percentage\nfigures. The absolute number of such cases is 10.52 lakhs,\nwhich figure, by no means, can be termed as miniscule, to\nharm the economy and create adverse effect on the nation.\nThe respondents have argued that Aadhaar will ensure that\nthere is no duplication of identity as biometrics will not\nallow that and, therefore, it may check the growth of shell\ncompanies as well.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n127. It would be apposite to quote the following discussion\nby the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report for the\nyear 2011:\n\n“Widening of Tax Base\n\nThe assessee base grew over the last five years from\n297.9 lakh taxpayers in 2005-06 to 340.9 lakh\ntaxpayers in 2009-10 at the rate of 14.4 per cent.\n\nThe Department has different mechanisms available\nto enhance the assessee base which include\ninspection and survey, information sharing with other\ntax departments and third-party information available\nin annual information returns. Automation also\nfacilitates greater crosslinking. Most of these\nmechanisms are available at the level of assessing\nofficers. The Department needs to holistically harness\nthese mechanisms at macro level to analyse the gaps\nin the assessee base. Permanent Account Numbers\n(PANs) issued up to March 2009 and March 2010\nwere 807.9 lakhs and 958 lakhs respectively. The\nreturns filled in 2008-09 and 2009-10 were 326.5\nlakhs and 340.9 lakhs respectively. The gap between\nPANs and the number of returns filed was 617.1 lakhs\nin 2009-10. The Board needs to identify the reasons\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 495 of 567\n\nfor the gap and use this information for appropriately\nenhancing the assessee base. The gap may be due\nto issuance of duplicate PAN cards and death of\nsome PAN card holders. The Department needs to\nput in place appropriate controls to weed out the\nduplicate PANs and also update the position in\nrespect of deceased assessee. It is significant to note\nthat the number of PAN card holders has increased\nby 117.7 per cent between 2005-06 to 2009-10\nwhereas the number of returns filed in the same\nperiod has increased by 14.4 per cent only.\n\nThe total direct tax collection has increased by 128.8\nper cent during the period 2005-06 to 2009-10. The\nincrease in the tax collection was around nine times\nas compared to increase in the assessee base. It\nshould be the constant endeavour of the Department\nto ensure that the entire assessee base, once\ncorrectly identified is duly meeting the entire tax\nliability. However, no assurance could be obtained\nthat the tax liability on the assessee is being\nassessed and collected properly. This comment is\ncorroborated in Para 2.4.1 of Chapter 2 of this report\nwhere we have mentioned about our detection of\nundercharge of tax amounting to Rs 12,842.7 crores\nin 19,230 cases audited during 2008-09. However,\ngiven the fact that ours is a test audit, the Department\nneeds to take firm steps towards strengthening the\ncontrols available on the existing statutes towards\nderiving an assurance on the tax collections.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n128. Likewise, the Finance Minister in his Budget speech in\nFebruary 2013 described the extent of tax evasion and\noffering lesser income tax than what is actually due thereby\nlabelling India as tax non-compliant, with the following\nfigures:\n\n“India's tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the\nproportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optional\nfrom the viewpoint of social justice. I place before you\ncertain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is\nnot commensurate with the income and consumption\npattern of Indian economy. As against estimated 4.2\ncrore persons engaged in organised sector\nemployment, the number of individuals filing return for\nsalary income are only 1.74 crores. As against 5.6\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 496 of 567\n\ncrore informal sector individual enterprises and firms\ndoing small business in India, the number of returns\nfiled by this category are only 1.81 crores. Out of the\n13.94 lakh companies registered in India up to 31-3-\n\n2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed their returns for\nAssessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh\ncompanies which have filed their returns for\nAssessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many as 2.76\nlakh companies have shown losses or zero income.\n2.85 lakh companies have shown profit before tax of\nless than Rs 1 crore. 28,667 companies have shown\nprofit between Rs 1 crore to Rs 10 crores, and only\n7781 companies have profit before tax of more than\nRs 10 crores. Among 3.7 crore individuals who filed\nthe tax returns in 2015-16, 99 lakhs show income\nbelow the exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh p.a. 1.95\ncrores show income between Rs 2.5 to Rs 5 lakhs, 52\nlakhs show income between Rs 5 to Rs 10 lakhs and\nonly 24 lakh people show income above Rs 10 lakhs.\nOf the 76 lakh individual assessees who declare\nincome above Rs 5 lakhs, 56 lakhs are in the salaried\nclass. The number of people showing income more\nthan 50 lakhs in the entire country is only 1.72 lakhs.\nWe can contrast this with the fact that in the last five\nyears, more than 1.25 crore cars have been sold, and\nnumber of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either for\nbusiness or tourism, is 2 crores in the year 2015.\nFrom all these figures we can conclude that we are\nlargely a tax non-compliant society. The\npredominance of the cash in the economy makes it\npossible for the people to evade their taxes. When\ntoo many people evade the taxes, the burden of their\nshare falls on those who are honest and compliant.”\n\n129. The respondents have also claimed that linking of\nAadhaar with PAN is consistent with India's international\nobligations and goals. In this behalf, it is pointed out that\nIndia has signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA)\nwith USA on 9-7-2015, for Improving International Tax\nCompliance and implementing the Foreign Account Tax\nCompliance Act (FATCA). India has also signed a\nmultilateral agreement on 3-6-2015, to automatically\nexchange information based on\nArticle 6\nof the Convention\non Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters under\nthe Common Reporting Scheme (CRS), formally referred to\nas the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial\nAccount Information (AEoI). As part of India's commitment\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 497 of 567\n\nunder FATCA and CRS, financial sector entities capture the\ndetails about the customers using the PAN. In case the\nPAN or submitted details are found to be incorrect or\nfictitious, it will create major embarrassment for the country.\nUnder Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS), the Income\nTax Department identifies non-filers with potential tax\nliabilities. Data analysis is carried out to identify non-filers\nabout whom specific information was available in AIR, CIB\ndata and TDS/TCS returns. Email/SMS and letters are sent\nto the identified non-filers communicating the information\nsummary and seeking to know the submission details of\nincome tax return. In a large number of cases (more than\n10 lakh PANs every year) it is seen that the PAN holder\nneither submits the response and in many cases the letters\nare return unserved. Field verification by field formations\nhave found that in a large number of cases, the PAN holder\nis untraceable. In many cases, the PAN holder mentions\nthat the transaction does not relate to them. There is a\nneed to strengthen PAN by linking it with Aadhaar/biometric\ninformation to prevent use of wrong PAN for high value\ntransactions.”\n\n422) Adverting to the aspect of proportionality, here again there was a\n\nspecific discussion in Binoy Viswam as this argument was raised,\n\nthough in the context of\nArticle 19\nof the Constitution. The Court\n\nafter explaining the doctrine of proportionality specifically held\n\nthat proportionality test stood applied with. Following discussion\n\nin\nthe said judgment\nwould amply demonstrate this proposition:\n\n“65. While monitoring the PILs relating to night shelters for\nthe homeless and the right to food through the public\ndistribution system, this Court has lauded and\ncomplimented the efforts of the State Governments for inter\nalia carrying out biometric identification of the head of\nfamily of each household to eliminate fictitious, bogus and\nineligible BPL/AAY household cards.\n\nxx xx xx\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 498 of 567\n\n125.2. Menace of corruption and black money has reached\nalarming proportion in this country. It is eating into the\neconomic progress which the country is otherwise\nachieving. It is not necessary to go into the various reasons\nfor this menace. However, it would be pertinent to comment\nthat even as per the observations of the Special\nInvestigation Team (SIT) on black money headed by\nJustice M.B. Shah, one of the reasons is that persons have\nthe option to quote their PAN or UID or passport number or\ndriving licence or any other proof of identity while entering\ninto financial/business transactions. Because of this\nmultiple methods of giving proofs of identity, there is no\nmechanism/system at present to collect the data available\nwith each of the independent proofs of ID. For this reason,\neven SIT suggested that these databases be\ninterconnected. To the same effect is the recommendation\nof the Committee headed by Chairman, CBDT on\nmeasures to tackle black money in India and abroad which\nalso discusses the problem of money laundering being\ndone to evade taxes under the garb of shell companies by\nthe persons who hold multiple bogus PAN numbers under\ndifferent names or variations of their names. That can be\npossible if one uniform proof of identity, namely, UID is\nadopted. It may go a long way to check and minimise the\nsaid malaise.\n\n125.3. Thirdly, Aadhaar or UID, which has come to be\nknown as the most advanced and sophisticated\ninfrastructure, may facilitate law-enforcement agencies to\ntake care of problem of terrorism to some extent and may\nalso be helpful in checking the crime and also help\ninvestigating agencies in cracking the crimes. No doubt,\ngoing by the aforesaid, and may be some other similarly\nvalid considerations, it is the intention of the Government to\ngive fillip to Aadhaar movement and encourage the people\nof this country to enrol themselves under the Aadhaar\nScheme.\n\n126. Whether such a scheme should remain voluntary or it\ncan be made mandatory imposing compulsiveness on the\npeople to be covered by Aadhaar is a different question\nwhich shall be addressed at the appropriate stage. At this\njuncture, it is only emphasised that mala fides cannot be\nattributed to this scheme. In any case, we are concerned\nwith the vires of\nSection 139-AA\nof the Income Tax Act,\n1961 which is a statutory provision. This Court is, thus,\ndealing with the aspect of judicial review of legislation.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 499 of 567\n\nInsofar as this provision is concerned, the explanation of\nthe respondents in the counter-affidavit, which has already\nbeen reproduced above, is that the primary purpose of\nintroducing this provision was to take care of the problem\nof multiple PAN cards obtained in fictitious names. Such\nmultiple cards in fictitious names are obtained with the\nmotive of indulging into money laundering, tax evasion,\ncreation and channelising of black money. It is mentioned\nthat in de-duplication exercises, 11.35 lakh cases of\nduplicate PANs/fraudulent PANs have been detected. Out\nof these, around 10.52 lakhs pertain to the individual\nassessees. Parliament in its wisdom thought that one PAN\nto one person can be ensured by adopting Aadhaar for\nallotment of PAN to individuals. As of today, that is the only\nmethod available i.e. by seeding of existing PAN with\nAadhaar. It is perceived as the best method, and the only\nrobust method of de-duplication of PAN database. It is\nclaimed by the respondents that the instance of duplicate\nAadhaar is almost non-existent. It is also claimed that\nseeding of PAN with Aadhaar may contribute to widening of\nthe tax case as well, by checking the tax evasions and\nbringing into tax hold those persons who are liable to pay\ntax but deliberately avoid doing so.”\n\n423) It has been stated by the respondents, on affidavit, that analysis\n\nof Form 61/60 data using PAN Aadhaar linkage shows that a\n\nlarge number of PAN holders do not quote their PAN in the\n\nprescribed transactions to prevent linking of the transactions to\n\nthe PAN. The analysis was performed by matching the Aadhaar\n\nnumber and person name reported in Form 61 (which was\n\npossible only due to linking of financial transactions/accounts with\n\nAadhaar) with the Aadhaar and name of the entity available in the\n\nITD PAN database (possible due to linking of PAN with Aadhaar).\n\nThis analysis identified 1.65 crore non-PAN transactions reported\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 500 of 567\n\nthrough Form 61 (relating to FY 2016-17 and FY 2017-18) where\n\nPAN of the transacting party was present in the PAN database\n\nand was not mentioned filing a wrong form deliberately. These\n\ntransactions totalled to around Rs. 33,000 crore (based on\n\ntransaction amount reported). This is the amount of undisclosed\n\nhigh value transaction which would have gone undetected had it\n\nnot been for Aadhaar linkage. Similar matching has also helped\n\npopulating PAN in 1.12 lakh non-PAN transactions reported under\n\nStatement of Financial Transactions (SFT). Majority of the non-\n\nPAN transactions reported are around Deposit in Cash,\n\nInvestment in time deposit, Sale of immovable property, Purchase\n\nof immovable property and Opening an account (other than\n\nsavings and time deposit). Thus, linking of PAN with Aadhaar will\n\nsignificantly enhance legitimate collection of country’s revenue.\n\n424) Taking into account the aforesaid consideration as well as other\n\nfactors mentioned above, we feel that there is a justifiable reason\n\nwith the State for collection and storage of data in the form of\n\nAadhaar and linking it with PAN insofar as\nSection 139AA\nof the\n\nIncome Tax Act is concerned. We would like to reproduce para\n\n311 of K.S. Puttaswamy judgment, which reads as under:\n\n“311. Apart from national security, the State may have\njustifiable reasons for the collection and storage of data. In\na social welfare State, the Government embarks upon\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 501 of 567\n\nprogrammes which provide benefits to impoverished and\nmarginalised sections of society. There is a vital State\ninterest in ensuring that scarce public resources are not\ndissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do\nnot qualify as recipients. Allocation of resources for human\ndevelopment is coupled with a legitimate concern that the\nutilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for\nextraneous purposes. Data mining with the object of\nensuring that resources are properly deployed to legitimate\nbeneficiaries is a valid ground for the State to insist on the\ncollection of authentic data. But, the data which the State\nhas collected has to be utilised for legitimate purposes of\nthe State and ought not to be utilised unauthorisedly for\nextraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate\nconcerns of the State are duly safeguarded while, at the\nsame time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention and\ninvestigation of crime and protection of the revenue are\namong the legitimate aims of the State. Digital platforms\nare a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a social\nwelfare State. Information technology—legitimately\ndeployed is a powerful enabler in the spread of innovation\nand knowledge.”\n\n425) Following passages from\nSubramanian Swamy v. Union of India,\n\nMinistry of Law & Ors.154\nmay also be relevant in this behalf and\n\nthe same are reproduced below:\n\n“122.\nIn\nState of Madras v. V.G. Row\n, the Court has ruled\nthat the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed,\nshould be applied to each individual statute impugned and\nno abstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness\ncan be laid down as applicable to all cases. The nature of\nthe right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying\npurpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency\nof the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion\nof the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time,\nshould all enter into the judicial verdict.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n130. The principles as regards reasonable restriction as\nhas been stated by this Court from time to time are that the\n\n154(2016) 7 SCC 221\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 502 of 567\n\nrestriction should not be excessive and in public interest.\n\nThe legislation should not invade the rights and should not\nsmack of arbitrariness. The test of reasonableness cannot\nbe determined by laying down any abstract standard or\ngeneral pattern. It would depend upon the nature of the\nright which has been infringed or sought to be infringed.\nThe ultimate “impact”, that is, effect on the right has to be\ndetermined. The “impact doctrine” or the principle of\n“inevitable effect” or “inevitable consequence” stands in\ncontradistinction to abuse or misuse of a legislation or a\nstatutory provision depending upon the circumstances of\nthe case. The prevailing conditions of the time and the\nprinciples of proportionality of restraint are to be kept in\nmind by the court while adjudging the constitutionality of a\nprovision regard being had to the nature of the right. The\nnature of social control which includes public interest has a\nrole. The conception of social interest has to be borne in\nmind while considering reasonableness of the restriction\nimposed on a right. The social interest principle would\ninclude the felt needs of the society.\n\nxx xx xx\n\n194. Needless to emphasise that when a law limits a\nconstitutional right which many laws do, such limitation is\nconstitutional if it is proportional. The law imposing restriction is\nproportional if it is meant to achieve a proper purpose, and if the\nmeasures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally\nconnected to the purpose, and such measures are necessary.\nSuch limitations should not be arbitrary or of an excessive\nnature beyond what is required in the interest of the public.\nReasonableness is judged with reference to the objective which\nthe legislation seeks to achieve, and must not be in excess of\nthat objective (see P.P. Enterprisesv. Union of India). Further,\nthe reasonableness is examined in an objective manner from\nthe standpoint of the interest of the general public and not from\nthe point of view of the person upon whom the restrictions are\nimposed or abstract considerations (see\nMohd. Hanif Quareshi\nv. State of Bihar\n)\n\nOn independent examination of the matter, the aforesaid\n\nexercise undertaken in the Binoy Viswam is hereby affirmed as\n\nwe are in agreement therewith. We, thus, hold that the provisions\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 503 of 567\n\nof\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 meet the triple test\n\nof right to privacy, contained in K.S.

and\n\n(iv) such information as may be required by the reporting\nentity to collectively establish the legal existence of such an\nassociation or body of individuals:\n\nProvided that for the purpose of this clause if the\nperson holding an attorney to transact on the company’s\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 508 of 567\n\nbehalf is not eligible to be enrolled for Aadhaar number and\ndoes not submit the Permanent Account Number, certified\ncopy of an officially valid document shall be submitted.”\n\n(c) after sub-rule (14), the following sub-rules shall be\ninserted, namely,-\n\n(15) Any reporting entity, at the time of receipt of the\nAadhaar number under provisions of this rule, shall carry\nout authentication using either e-KYC authentication facility\nor Yes/No authentication facility provided by Unique\nIdentification Authority of India.\n\n(16) In case the client referred to in sub-rules (4) to (9) of\nrule 9 is not a resident or is a resident in the States of\nJammu and Kashmir, Assam or Meghalaya and does not\nsubmit the Permanent Account Number, the client shall\nsubmit to the reporting entity one certified copy of officially\nvalid document containing details of his identity and\naddress, one recent photograph and such other document\nincluding in respect of the nature of business and financial\nstatus of the client as may be required by the reporting\nentity.\n\n(17) (a) In case the client, eligible to be enrolled for\nAadhaar and obtain a Permanent Account Number,\nreferred to in sub-rules (4) to (9) of rule 9 does not submit\nthe Aadhaar number or the Permanent Account Number at\nthe time of commencement of an account based\nrelationship with a reporting entity, the client shall submit\nthe same within a period of six months from the date of the\ncommencement of the account based relationship:\n\nProvided that the clients, eligible to be enrolled for\nAadhaar and obtain the Permanent Account Number,\nalready having an account based relationship with\nreporting entities prior to date of this notification, the client\nshall submit the Aadhaar number and Permanent Account\nNumber by 31st December, 2017.\n\n(b) As per regulation 12 of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and\nUpdate) Regulations, 2016, the local authorities in the\nState Governments or Union-territory Administrations have\nbecome or are in the process of becoming UIDAI\nRegistrars for Aadhaar enrolment and are organising\nspecial Aadhaar enrolment camps at convenient locations\nfor providing enrolment facilities in consultation with UIDAI\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 509 of 567\n\nand any individual desirous of commencing an account\nbased relationship as provided in this rule, who does not\npossess the Aadhaar number or has not yet enrolled for\nAadhaar, may also visit such special Aadhaar enrolment\ncamps for Aadhaar enrolment or any of the Aadhaar\nenrolment centres in the vicinity with existing registrars of\nUIDAI.\n\n(c) In case the client fails to submit the Aadhaar number\nand Permanent Account Number within the aforesaid six\nmonths period, the said account shall cease to be\noperational till the time the Aadhaar number and\nPermanent Account Number is submitted by the client:\n\nProvided that in case client already having an\naccount based relationship with reporting entities prior to\ndate of this notification fails to submit the Aadhaar number\nand Permanent Account Number by 31st December, 2017,\nthe said account shall cease to be operational till the time\nthe Aadhaar number and Permanent Account Number is\nsubmitted by the client.\n\n(18) In case the identity information relating to the\nAadhaar number or Permanent Account Number submitted\nby the client referred to in sub-rules (4) to (9) of rule 9 does\nnot have current address of the client, the client shall\nsubmit an officially valid documents to the reporting entity.”\n\nAs can be seen from the above, linking of Aadhaar with the\n\nbank account is now mandatory. It applies not only to those bank\n\naccounts which would be opened after the bringing into force the\n\namendment but even the existing accounts as well.\n\n427) Linking of a banking account to Aadhaar is challenged as\n\nviolative of\nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\nand\nof the Constitution and\n\nalso of\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002\n. Elaborate\n\nsubmissions were made by Mr. Arvind Datar on the aforesaid\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 510 of 567\n\naspects. It was argued that those persons who do not choose to\n\nenrol for Aadhaar number would not be in a position to open the\n\nbank account or even operate the existing bank account and\n\nthere is no valid explanation as to why all bank accounts had to\n\nbe authenticated. It was also argued that provisions of the Rule\n\nreferred to companies, firms, trust etc. as well, though the\n\nAadhaar Act is meant for establishing identity of individuals only.\n\nIt was further submitted that in case a person fails to link Aadhaar\n\nwith the bank account, such person would be rendered ineligible\n\nto operate the bank account, which would amount to forfeiting her\n\nmoney lying in the account which belongs to her. This amounts\n\nto depriving the person from her property and is, therefore,\n\nviolative of\nArticle 300A\nof the Constitution as such a deprivation\n\ncan take place only by primary legislation and not by subordinate\n\nlegislation in the form of Rules. Much emphasis was also laid on\n\nthe argument that the amended Rule does not pass the\n\nproportionality test.\n\n428) Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General, refuted\n\nthe aforesaid submissions. He pointed out the objective with\n\nwhich the\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act\nwas enacted,\n\nnamely, to curb money laundering and black money, which is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 511 of 567\n\nbecoming a menace. Therefore, the amendment to Rules serves\n\na legitimate State aim. He argued that the Rules are not arbitrary\n\nand satisfies the proportionality test also, having regard to the\n\nlaudable objective which it seeks to serve.\n\n429) After giving our thoughtful consideration to the various aspects,\n\nwe feel that it is not even necessary to deal with each and every\n\ncontention raised by the petitioners. Our considered opinion is\n\nthat it does not meet the test of proportionality and is also\n\nviolative of right to privacy of a person which extends to banking\n\ndetails.\n\n430) This Court has held in\nRam Jethmalani & Ors. v. Union of India &\n\nOrs.155\nthat revelation of bank details without prima facie ground\n\nof wrong doing would be violative of right to privacy. The said\n\ndecision has been approved in K.S. Puttaswamy. Under the garb\n\nof prevention of money laundering or black money, there cannot\n\nbe such a sweeping provision which targets every resident of the\n\ncountry as a suspicious person. Presumption of criminality is\n\ntreated as disproportionate and arbitrary.\n\n431) Nobody would keep black money in the bank account. We\n\naccept the possibility of opening an account in an assumed name\n\n155(2011) 8 SCC 1\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 512 of 567\n\nand keeping black money therein which can be laundered as\n\nwell. However, the persons doing such an Act, if at all, would be\n\nvery few. More importantly, those having bank accounts with\n\nmodest balance and routine transactions can be safely ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the provision in the present form does not meet the\n\ntest of proportionality. Therefore, for checking this possible\n\nmalice, there cannot be a mandatory provision for linking of every\n\nbank account.\n\n432) In\nLal Babu Hussein v. Electoral Registration Officer and\n\nOthers156\n, this Court had struck down the order of the Electoral\n\nOfficer asking the residents of a particular en masse to prove\n\ntheir identity as unconstitutional. The Court held that the\n\nElectoral officer asking residents of a particular area en masse to\n\nprove their identity was unconstitutional. In the case, the EO\n\nwent on the assumption that all inhabitants of a particular area\n\nwere foreigners, notwithstanding their name appearing in earlier\n\nelectoral rolls. The court held the following:\n\n(a) Right to vote cannot be disallowed by insisting only on 4\n\nproofs of identity-voters can rely on any other proof of identity and\n\nobtain right to vote.\n\n(b) Notices were quashed because they failed to distinguish\n\n156(1995) 3 SCC 100\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 513 of 567\n\nbetween existing voters who had voted several times and new\n\nvoters.\n\n(c) Large-scale presumption of illegality impermissible.\n\n433) This linking is made compulsory not only for opening a new bank\n\naccount but even for existing bank accounts with a stipulation that\n\nif the same is not done then the account would be deactivated,\n\nwith the result that the holder of the account would not be entitled\n\nto operate the bank account till the time seeding of the bank\n\naccount with Aadhaar is done. This amounts to depriving a\n\nperson of his property. We find that this move of mandatory\n\nlinking of Aadhaar with bank account does not satisfy the test of\n\nproportionality. To recapitulate, the test of proportionality requires\n\nthat a limitation of the fundamental rights must satisfy the\n\nfollowing to be proportionate: (i) it is designated for a proper\n\npurpose; (ii) measures are undertaken to effectuate the limitation\n\nare rationally connected to the fulfilment of the purpose; (iii) there\n\nare no alternative less invasive measures; and (iv) there is a\n\nproper relation between the importance of achieving the aim and\n\nthe importance of limiting the right.\n\n434) The Rules are disproportionate for the following reasons:\n\n(a) a mere ritualistic incantation of “money laundering”, “black\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 514 of 567\n\nmoney” does not satisfy the first test;\n\n(b) no explanations have been given as to how mandatory\n\nlinking of every bank account will eradicate/reduce the problems\n\nof “money laundering” and “black money”;\n\n(c) there are alternative methods of KYC which the banks are\n\nalready undertaking, the state has not discharged its burden as to\n\nwhy linking of Aadhaar is imperative. We may point out that RBI’s\n\nown Master Direction (KYC Direction, 2016) No. DBR.AML.BC.\n\nNo. 81/14.01.001/2015-16 allows using alternatives to Aadhaar to\n\nopen bank accounts.\n\n435) There may be legitimate State aim for such a move as it aims at\n\nprevention of money laundering and black money. However,\n\nthere has not been a serious thinking while making such a\n\nprovision applicable for every bank account. Maintaining back\n\naccount in today’s world has almost become a necessity. The\n\nGovernment itself has propagated the advantages thereof and is\n\nencouraging people to open the bank account making it possible\n\nto have one even with Zero Balance under the Pradhan Mantri\n\nJan Dhan Yojana. The Government has taken various measures\n\nto give a boost to digital economy. Under these schemes,\n\nmillions of persons, who are otherwise poor, are opening their\n\nbank accounts. They are also becoming habitual to the good\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 515 of 567\n\npractice of entering into transactions through their banks and\n\neven by using digital modes for operation of the bank accounts.\n\nMaking the requirement of Aadhaar compulsory for all such and\n\nother persons in the name of checking money laundering or black\n\nmoney is grossly disproportionate. There should have been a\n\nproper study about the methods adopted by persons who indulge\n\nin money laundering, kinds of bank accounts which such persons\n\nmaintain and target those bank accounts for the purpose of\n\nAadhaar. It has not been done.\n\n436) We, thus, hold the amendment to Rule 9, by the Seventh\n\nAmendment Rules, 2017, in the present form, to be\n\nunconstitutional.\n\nLinking of Mobile Number with Aadhaar\n\n437) By a Circular dated March 23, 2017, the Department of\n\nTelecommunications has directed that all licensees shall reverify\n\nthe existing mobile subscribers (pre-paid and post-paid) through\n\nAadhaar based e-KYC process. In fine, it amounts to mandatory\n\nlinking of mobile connections with Aadhaar, which requirement is\n\nnot only in respect of those individuals who would be becoming\n\nmobile subscribers, but applies to existing subscribers as well.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 516 of 567\n\n438) It was the submission of the petitioners that such a linking of the\n\nSIM card with Aadhaar number violates their right to privacy. It is\n\nargued that since it is a fundamental right, the restrictions/curb\n\nthereupon in the form of said linking does not satisfy the tests\nlaid\n\ndown in\nK.S. Puttaswamy inasmuch as it is neither backed by any\n\nlaw nor it serves any legitimate state aim nor does it meet the\n\nrequirement of proportionality test.\n\n439) At the outset, it may be mentioned that the respondents have not\n\nbeen able to show any statutory provision which permits the\n\nrespondents to issue such a circular. It is administrative in\n\nnature. The respondents have, however, tried to justify the same\n\non the ground that there have been numerous instances where\n\nnon-verification of SIM cards have posed serious security threats.\n\nHaving regard to the same, this Court had given direction in\n\nLokniti Foundation v. Union of India & Anr.157\nfor the linking of SIM\n\ncard with Aadhaar and it is pursuant to those directions that the\n\nTelecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recommended this\n\nstep. Therefore, as per the respondents, Circular dated March\n\n23, 2017 is the outcome of the aforesaid directions and\n\nrecommendations which should be treated as backing of law.\n\nAccording to them, direction of this Court is a law under\nArticle\n\n157 (2017) 7\nSCC 155\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 517 of 567\n\n141 of the Constitution. In addition, it is also argued that since\n\nSection 4\nof the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 empowers the\n\nCentral Government to issue licenses for establishing,\n\nmaintaining and working telegraphs, it is within the power of the\n\nCentral Government to grant such licenses with condition and,\n\ntherefore, Circular dated March 23, 2017 may be read as\n\ncondition for grant of licenses. On this premise, attempt is to\n\nshow that the Circular is issued in exercise of the powers\n\ncontained in\nSection 4\nof the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 which is\n\nthe force of law.\n\n440) In order to appreciate the respondents’ contentions, we\n\nreproduce the relevant portion of Circular dated March 23, 2017,\n\nwhich reads as under:\n\n“Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its order dated 06.02.2017\npassed in Writ Petition (C) No. 607/2016 filed by\nLokniti\nFoundation v/s Union of India\n, while taking into cognizance\nof “Aadhaar based e-KYC process for issuing new\ntelephone connection” issued by the Department, has inter-\nalia observed that “an effective process has been evolved\nto ensure identity verification, as well as, the addresses of\nall mobile phone subscribers for new subscribers. In the\nnear future, and more particularly, within one year from\ntoday, a similar verification will be completed, in case of\nexisting subscribers.” This amounts to a direction which is\nto be completed within a time frame of one year.\n\n2. A meeting was held on 13.02.2017 in the Department\nwith the telecom industry wherein UIDAI, TRAI and PMO\nrepresentatives also participated to discuss the way\nforward to implement the directions of Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt. Detailed discussions and deliberations were held in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 518 of 567\n\nthe meeting. The suggestions received from the industry\nhave been examined in the Department.\n\n3. Accordingly, after taking into consideration the\ndiscussions held in the meeting and suggestions received\nfrom telecom industry, the undersigned is directed to\nconvey the approval of competent authority that all\nLicensees shall re-verify all existing mobile subscribers\n(prepaid and postpaid) through Aadhaar based e-KYC\nprocess as mentioned in this office letter No. 800-29/2010-\n\nVAS dated 16.08.2016. The instructions mentioned in\nsubsequent paragraphs shall be strictly followed while\ncarrying out the re-verification exercise.”\n\n441) In the first instance, it may be noticed that reference is made to\n\nthe judgment of this Court in Lokniti Foundation which has\n\nprompted the Ministry of Communications to issue this circular.\n\nParagraph 1 of the Circular itself states that the observations of\n\nthe Court in Lokniti Foundation amount to a direction. Thus, the\n\nCircular is not issued in exercise of powers under\nSection 4\nof the\n\nIndian Telegraph Act, 1885 (though that itself would be debatable\n\nas to whether\nSection 4\ngives such a power at all). Insofar as\n\nobservations of this Court\nin that case\nare concerned, it is clear\n\nthat in the said brief order, this Court did not go into the issue as\n\nto whether linking of SIM card with Aadhaar would be violate of\n\nprivacy rights of the citizens. In that petition filed as a Public\n\nInterest Litigation, a prayer was made to the effect that identity of\n\neach subscriber and also the numbers should be verified so that\n\nunidentified and unverified subscribers are not allowed to misuse\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 519 of 567\n\nmobile numbers. In response, the Union of India had filed the\n\ncounter affidavit bringing to the notice of the Court that the\n\nDepartment had launched Aadhaar based e-KYC for issuing\n\nmobile connections. Based on this statement, orders were\n\npassed by this Court. Lis, which is the subject matter of instant\n\npetitions, was not raised in the said case. Obviously, the Court\n\ndid not deliberate on the aspects of necessity of such a provision\n\nin the light of right to privacy. It was a case where both the sides\n\nwere at ad idem. In the absence of any such issue or discussion\n\nthereupon, such a case cannot be treated as precedent and as a\n\ncorollary it cannot be termed as ‘law’ within the meaning of\nArticle\nor\nArticle 141\nof the Constitution. Moreover, we are unable to\n\nread the order in Lokniti Foundation as a direction of the Court. It\n\nsimply disposed of the petition after recording the submission of\n\nthe Union of India to the effect that the grievance of the petitioner\n\ntherein stood redressed by evolving the procedure of linking. On\n\nthat the Court simply observed that undertaking given to this\n\nCourt will be seriously taken and given effect to. No doubt, the\n\nCentral Government, as a licensor, can impose conditions while\n\ngranting licenses under\nSection 4\nof the Indian Telegraph Act,\n\n1885. However, such directions/conditions have to be legally\n\nvalid. When it affects the rights of the third parties (like the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 520 of 567\n\npetitioners herein who are not party to the licenses granted by the\n\nGovernment to the Telecom Service Providers) they have a right\n\nto challenge such directions. Here, the case made out by the\n\npetitioners is that it infringes their right to privacy.\n\n442) We are of the opinion that not only such a circular lacks backing\n\nof a law, it fails to meet the requirement of proportionality as well.\n\nIt does not meet ‘necessity stage’ and ‘balancing stage’ tests to\n\ncheck the primary menace which is in the mind of the respondent\n\nauthorities. There can be other appropriate laws and less\n\nintrusive alternatives. For the misuse of such SIM cards by a\n\nhandful of persons, the entire population cannot be subjected to\n\nintrusion into their private lives. It also impinges upon the\n\nvoluntary nature of the Aadhaar scheme. We find it to be\n\ndisproportionate and unreasonable state compulsion. It is to be\n\nborne in mind that every individual/resident subscribing to a SIM\n\ncard does not enjoy the subsidy benefit or services mentioned in\n\nSection 7\nof the Act.\n\nWe, therefore, have no hesitation in declaring the Circular\n\ndated March 23, 2017 as unconstitutional.\n\nViolation of the orders passed by this Court:\n\nWhether certain actions of the respondents are in contravention\nof the interim orders passed by the Court, if so, the effect\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 521 of 567\n\nthereof?\n\n443) It was vehemently argued that this Court had passed number of\n\ninterim orders (which have already been taken note of in the\n\nbeginning of this judgment) categorically stating that the Aadhaar\n\nenrolment is voluntary; that no person would be forced to enrol\n\nunder the scheme; that a person would be told about the\n\nvoluntary nature of the scheme; and that enrolment shall not be\n\ngiven to any illegal migrant. As per the petitioners,\n\nnotwithstanding these orders, the Central Government as well as\n\nthe State Governments have issued various notifications\n\nrequiring Aadhaar authentication for benefits, subsidies and\n\nschemes mandatory. In this manner, according to the petitioners,\n\nthe respondents have violated the orders of this Court and it is\n\nthe majesty of the Court which is at stake.\n\n444) It is not in dispute that the aforesaid orders were passed when\n\nthe Aadhaar Act had not come into force. After the enactment,\n\nSection 7\nhad altered the position statutorily. The notifications\n\nand circulars etc. are issued under this provision. Therefore,\n\ntechnically speaking, it cannot be held that these circulars are\n\nissued in contravention of the orders passed by this Court.\n\n445) We feel that it would have been better had a clarification been\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 522 of 567\n\nobtained from the Court after the passing of the Aadhaar Act\n\nbefore issuing such circulars and orders under\nSection 7\n. When\n\nthe matter is sub judice in the Court and certain orders operating,\n\nthe respondents should have shown some fairness by taking that\n\nroute, which expectation would be high where the respondent is\n\nthe State. However, it would be difficult to hold the respondents\n\nin contempt of the orders passed by this Court. We may note\n\nthat similar argument was advanced in Binoy Viswam, namely,\n\ninsertion of\nSection 139AA\nin the\nIncome Tax Act\nwas in breach of\n\ninterim orders passed by this Court. This argument was repelled\n\nin the following manner:\n\n“99. Main emphasis, however, is on the plea that\nParliament or any State Legislature cannot pass a law that\noverrules a judgment thereby nullifying\nthe said decision\n,\nthat too without removing the basis of the decision. This\nargument appears to be attractive inasmuch as few orders\nare passed by this Court in pending writ petitions which are\nto the effect that the enrolment of Aadhaar would be\nvoluntary. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the\norders have been passed in the petitions where Aadhaar\nScheme floated as an executive/administrative measure\nhas been challenged. In those cases, the said orders are\nnot passed in a case where the Court was dealing with a\nstatute passed by Parliament. Further, these are interim\norders as the Court was of the opinion that till the matter is\ndecided finally in the context of right to privacy issue, the\nimplementation of the said Aadhaar Scheme would remain\nvoluntary. In fact, the main issue as to whether Aadhaar\ncard scheme whereby biometric data of an individual is\ncollected violates right to privacy and, therefore, is\noffensive of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution or not is yet to be\ndecided. In the process, the Constitution Bench is also\ncalled upon to decide as to whether right to privacy is a\npart of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution at all. Therefore, no\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 523 of 567\n\nfinal decision has been taken. In a situation like this, it\ncannot be said that Parliament is precluded from or it is\nrendered incompetent to pass such a law. That apart, the\nargument of the petitioners is that the basis on which the\naforesaid orders are passed has to be removed, which is\nnot done. According to the petitioners, it could be done only\nby making the Aadhaar Act compulsory. It is difficult to\naccept this contention for two reasons: first, when the\norders passed by this Court which are relied upon by the\npetitioners were passed when the Aadhaar Act was not\neven enacted. Secondly, as already discussed in detail\nabove, the Aadhaar Act and the law contained in\nSection\n139-AA\nof the Income Tax Act deal with two different\nsituations and operate in different fields. This argument of\nlegislative incompetence also, therefore, fails.”\n\nSummary and Conclusions:\n\n446) (a) The architecture and structure of the Aadhaar Act reveals\n\nthat the UIDAI is established as a statutory body which is given\n\nthe task of developing the policy, procedure and system for\n\nissuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals and also to perform\n\nauthentication thereof as per the provisions of the Act. For the\n\npurpose of enrolment and assigning Aadhaar numbers, enrolling\n\nagencies are recruited by the Authority. All the residents in India\n\nare eligible to obtain an Aadhaar number. To enable a resident to\n\nget Aadhaar number, he is required to submit demographic as\n\nwell as biometric information i.e., apart from giving information\n\nrelating to name, date of birth and address, biometric information\n\nin the form of photograph, fingerprint, iris scan is also to be\n\nprovided. Aadhaar number given to a particular person is treated\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 524 of 567\n\nas unique number as it cannot be reassigned to any other\n\nindividual.\n\n(b) Insofar as subsidies, benefits or services to be given by the\n\nCentral Government or the State Government, as the case may\n\nbe, is concerned, these Governments can mandate that receipt of\n\nthese subsidies, benefits and services would be given only on\n\nfurnishing proof of possession of Aadhaar number (or proof of\n\nmaking an application for enrolment, where Aadhaar number is\n\nnot assigned). An added requirement is that such individual\n\nwould undergo authentication at the time of receiving such\n\nbenefits etc. A particular institution/body from which the aforesaid\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service is to be claimed by such an individual,\n\nthe intended recipient would submit his Aadhaar number and is\n\nalso required to give her biometric information to that agency. On\n\nreceiving this information and for the purpose of its\n\nauthentication, the said agency, known as Requesting Entity\n\n(RE), would send the request to the Authority which shall perform\n\nthe job of authentication of Aadhaar number. On confirming the\n\nidentity of a person, the individual is entitled to receive subsidy,\n\nbenefit or service. Aadhaar number is permitted to be used by\n\nthe holder for other purposes as well.\n\n(c) In this whole process, any resident seeking to obtain an\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 525 of 567\n\nAadhaar number is, in the first instance, required to submit her\n\ndemographic information and biometric information at the time of\n\nenrolment. She, thus, parts with her photograph, fingerprint and\n\niris scan at that stage by giving the same to the enrolling agency,\n\nwhich may be a private body/person. Likewise, every time when\n\nsuch Aadhaar holder intends to receive a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice and goes to specified/designated agency or person for\n\nthat purpose, she would be giving her biometric information to\n\nthat RE, which, in turn, shall get the same authenticated from the\n\nAuthority before providing a subsidy, benefit or service.\n\n(d) Attack of the petitioners to the Aadhaar programme and its\n\nformation/structure under the Aadhaar Act is founded on the\n\narguments that it is a grave risk to the rights and liberties of the\n\ncitizens of this country which are secured by the Constitution of\n\nIndia. It militates against the constitutional abiding values and its\n\nfoundational morality and has the potential to enable an intrusive\n\nstate to become a surveillance state on the basis of information\n\nthat is collected in respect of each individual by creation of a joint\n\nelectronic mesh. In this manner, the Act strikes at the very\n\nprivacy of each individual thereby offending the right to privacy\n\nwhich is elevated and given the status of fundamental right by\n\ntracing it to\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\nof the Constitution of India by a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 526 of 567\n\nnine Judge Bench judgment of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy.\n\n(e) The respondents, on the other hand, have attempted to\n\nshake the very foundation of the aforesaid structure of the\n\npetitioners’ case. They argue that in the first instance, minimal\n\nbiometric information of the applicant, who intends to have\n\nAadhaar number, is obtained which is also stored in CIDR for the\n\npurpose of authentication. Secondly, no other information is\n\nstored. It is emphasised that there is no data collection in respect\n\nof religion, caste, tribe, language records of entitlement, income\n\nor medical history of the applicant at the time of Aadhaar\n\nenrolment. Thirdly, the Authority also claimed that the entire\n\nAadhaar enrolment eco-system is foolproof inasmuch as within\n\nfew seconds of the biometrics having been collected by the\n\nenrolling agency, the said information gets transmitted the\n\nAuthorities/CIDR, that too in an encrypted form, and goes out of\n\nthe reach of the enrolling agency. Same is the situation at the\n\ntime of authentication as biometric information does not remain\n\nwith the requesting agency. Fourthly, while undertaking the\n\nauthentication process, the Authority simply matches the\n\nbiometrics and no other information is received or stored in\n\nrespect of purpose, location or nature or transaction etc.\n\nTherefore, the question of profiling does not arise at all.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 527 of 567\n\n(f) In the aforesaid scenario, it is necessary, in the first\n\ninstance, to find out the extent of core information, biometric as\n\nwell as demographic, that is collected and stored by the Authority\n\nat the time of enrolment as well as at the time of authentication.\n\nThis exercise becomes necessary in order to consider the\n\nargument of the petitioners about the profiling of the Aadhaar\n\nholders. On going through this aspect, on the basis of the\n\npowerpoint presentation given by Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO\n\nof UIDAI, and the arguments of both the sides, including the\n\nquestions which were put by the petitioners to Dr. Pandey and the\n\nanswers thereupon, the Court has come to the conclusion that\n\nminimal possible data, demographic and biometric, is obtained\n\nfrom the Aadhaar holders.\n\n(g) The Court also noticed that the whole architecture of Aadhaar\n\nis devised to give unique identity to the citizens of this country.\n\nNo doubt, a person can have various documents on the basis of\n\nwhich that individual can establish her identify. It may be in the\n\nform of a passport, PAN card, ration card and so on. For the\n\npurpose of enrolment itself number of documents are prescribed\n\nwhich an individual can produce on the basis of which Aadhaar\n\ncard can be issued. Thus, such documents, in a way, are also\n\nproof of identity. However, there is a fundamental difference\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 528 of 567\n\nbetween the Aadhaar card as a mean of identity and other\n\ndocuments through which identity can be established. Enrolment\n\nfor Aadhaar card also requires giving of demographic information\n\nas well as biometric information which is in the form of iris and\n\nfingerprints. This process eliminates any chance of duplication.\n\nIt is emphasised that an individual can manipulate the system by\n\nhaving more than one or even number of PAN cards, passports,\n\nration cards etc. When it comes to obtaining Aadhaar card, there\n\nis no possibility of obtaining duplicate card. Once the biometric\n\ninformation is stored and on that basis Aadhaar card is issued, it\n\nremains in the system with the Authority. Wherever there would\n\nbe a second attempt for enrolling for Aadhaar and for this\n\npurpose same person gives his biometric information, it would be\n\nimmediately get matched with the same biometric information\n\nalready in the system and the second request would stand\n\nrejected. It is for this reason the Aadhaar card is known as\n\nUnique Identification (UID). Such an identity is unparalleled.\n\n(h) There is, then, another purpose for having such a system of\n\nissuing unique identification cards in the form of Aadhaar card. A\n\nglimpse thereof is captured under the heading ‘Introduction’\n\nabove, while mentioning how and under what circumstances the\n\nwhole project was conceptualised. To put it tersely, in addition to\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 529 of 567\n\nenabling any resident to obtain such unique identification proof, it\n\nis also to empower marginalised section of the society,\n\nparticularly those who are illiterate and living in abject poverty or\n\nwithout any shelter etc. It gives identity to such persons also.\n\nMoreover, with the aid of Aadhaar card, they can claim various\n\nprivileges and benefits etc. which are actually meant for these\n\npeople.\n\n(i) Identity of a person has a significance for every individual in\n\nhis/her life. In a civilised society every individual, on taking birth,\n\nis given a name. Her place of birth and parentage also becomes\n\nimportant as she is known in the society and these demographic\n\nparticulars also become important attribute of her personality.\n\nThroughout their lives, individuals are supposed to provide such\n\ninformation: be it admission in a school or college or at the time of\n\ntaking job or engaging in any profession or business activity, etc.\n\nWhen all this information is available in one place, in the form of\n\nAadhaar card, it not only becomes unique, it would also qualify as\n\na document of empowerment. Added with this feature, when an\n\nindividual knows that no other person can clone her, it assumes\n\ngreater significance.\n\n(j) Thus, the scheme by itself can be treated as laudable when\n\nit comes to enabling an individual to seek Aadhaar number, more\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 530 of 567\n\nso, when it is voluntary in nature. Howsoever benevolent the\n\nscheme may be, it has to pass the muster of constitutionality.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, the very architecture of Aadhaar is\n\nunconstitutional on various grounds.\n\n(k) The Court has taken note of the heads of challenge of the\n\nAct, Scheme and certain Rules etc. and clarified that the matter is\n\nexamined with objective examination of the issues on the\n\ntouchstone of the constitutional provisions, keeping in mind the\n\nethos of constitutional democracy, rule of law, human rights and\n\nother basic features of the Constitution.\n\nDiscussing the scope of judicial review, the Court has\n\naccepted that apart from two grounds noticed in Binoy Viswam,\n\non which legislative Act can be invalidated [(a) the Legislature\n\ndoes not have competence to make the law; and b) law made is\n\nin violation of fundamental rights or any other constitutional\n\nprovision], another ground, namely, manifest arbitrariness, can\n\nalso be the basis on which an Act can be invalidated. The issues\n\nare examined having regard to the aforesaid scope of judicial\n\nreview.\n\n(l) From the arguments raised by the petitioners and the\n\ngrounds of challenge, it becomes clear that the main plank of\n\nchallenge is that the Aadhaar project and the Aadhaar Act\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 531 of 567\n\ninfringes right to privacy. Inbuilt in this right to privacy is the right\n\nto live with dignity, which is a postulate of right to privacy. In the\n\nprocess, discussion leads to the issue of proportionality, viz.\n\nwhether measures taken under the Aadhaar Act satisfy the\n\ndoctrine of proportionality.\n\n(m) In view of the above, the Court discussed the contours of\n\nright to privacy, as\nlaid down in\nK.S. Puttaswamy, principle of\n\nhuman dignity and doctrine of proportionality. After taking note of\n\nthe discussion contained in different opinions of six Hon’ble\n\nJudges, it stands established, without any pale of doubt, that\n\nprivacy has now been treated as part of fundamental right. The\n\nCourt has held that, in no uncertain terms, that privacy has\n\nalways been a natural right which given an individual freedom to\n\nexercise control over his or her personality. The judgment further\n\naffirms three aspects of the fundamental right to privacy, namely:\n\n(i) intrusion with an individual’s physical body,\n\n(ii) informational privacy and\n\n(iii) privacy of choice.\n\n(n) As succinctly put by Nariman, J., first aspect involves the\n\nperson himself/herself and guards a person’s rights relatable to\n\nhis physical body thereby controlling the uncalled invasion by the\n\nState. Insofar as second aspect, namely, informational privacy is\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 532 of 567\n\nconcerned, it does not deal with a person’s body but deals with a\n\nperson’s mind. In this manner, it protects a person by giving her\n\ncontrol over the dissemination of material that is personal to her\n\nand disallowing unauthorised use of such information by the\n\nState. Third aspect of privacy relates to individual’s autonomy by\n\nprotecting her fundamental personal choices. These aspects\n\nhave functional connection and relationship with dignity. In this\n\nsense, privacy is a postulate of human dignity itself. Human\n\ndignity has a constitutional value and its significance is\n\nacknowledged by the Preamble. Further, by catena of judgments,\n\nhuman dignity is treated as fundamental right as a facet not only\n\nof\nArticle 21\n, but that of right to equality (\nArticle 14\n) and also part\n\nof bouquet of freedoms stipulated in\nArticle 19.\nTherefore, privacy\n\nas a right is intrinsic of freedom, liberty and dignity. Viewed in this\n\nmanner, one can trace positive and negative contents of privacy.\n\nThe negative content restricts the State from committing an\n\nintrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its positive\n\ncontent imposes an obligation on the State to take all necessary\n\nmeasures to protect the privacy of the individual.\n\n(o) In developing the aforesaid concepts, the Court has been\n\nreceptive to the principles in international law and international\n\ninstruments. It is a recognition of the fact that certain human\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 533 of 567\n\nrights cannot be confined within the bounds of geographical\n\nlocation of a nation but have universal application. In the\n\nprocess, the Court accepts the concept of universalisation of\n\nhuman rights, including the right to privacy as a human right and\n\nthe good practices in developing and understanding such rights in\n\nother countries have been welcomed. In this hue, it can also be\n\nremarked that comparative law has played a very significant role\n\nin shaping the aforesaid judgment on privacy in Indian context,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that such comparative law has only\n\npersuasive value.\n\nThe whole process of reasoning contained in different\n\nopinions of the Hon’ble Judges would, thus, reflect that the\n\nargument that it is difficult to precisely define the common\n\ndenominator of privacy, was rejected. While doing so, the Court\n\nreferred to various approaches to formulating privacy\n\n(p) We have also remarked above, the taxonomy of privacy,\n\nnamely, on the basis of ‘harms’, ‘interest’ and ‘aggregation of\n\nrights’. We have also discussed the scope of right to privacy with\n\nreference to the cases at hand and the circumstances in which\n\nsuch a right can be limited. In the process, we have also taken\n\nnote of the passage from the judgment rendered by Nariman, J.\n\nin K.S. Puttaswamy stating the manner in which law has to be\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 534 of 567\n\ntested when it is challenged on the ground that it violates the\n\nfundamental right to privacy.\n\n(q) One important comment which needs to be made at this\n\nstage relates to the standard of judicial review while examining\n\nthe validity of a particular law that allegedly infringes right to\n\nprivacy. The question is as to whether the Court is to apply ‘strict\n\nscrutiny’ standard or the ‘just, fair and reasonableness’ standard.\n\nIn the privacy judgment, different observations are made by the\n\ndifferent Hon’ble Judges and the aforesaid aspect is not\n\ndetermined authoritatively, may be for the reason that the Bench\n\nwas deciding the reference on the issue as to whether right to\n\nprivacy is a fundamental right or not and, in the process, it was\n\ncalled upon to decide the specific questions referred to it. This\n\nCourt preferred to adopt a ‘just, fair and reasonableness’\n\nstandard which is in tune with the view expressed by majority of\n\nJudges in their opinion. Even otherwise, this is in consonance\n\nwith the judicial approach adopted by this Court while construing\n\n‘reasonable restrictions’ that the State can impose in public\n\ninterest, as provided in\nArticle 19\nof the Constitution. Insofar as\n\nprinciples of human dignity are concerned, the Court, after taking\n\nnote of various judgments where this principle is adopted and\n\nelaborated, summed up the essential ingredients of dignity\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 535 of 567\n\njurisprudence by noticing that the basic principle of dignity and\n\nfreedom of the individual is an attribute of natural law which\n\nbecomes the right of all individuals in a constitutional democracy.\n\nDignity has a central normative role as well as constitutional\n\nvalue. This normative role is performed in three ways:\n\nFirst, it becomes basis for constitutional rights;\n\nSecond, it serves as an interpretative principle for\n\ndetermining the scope of constitutional rights; and,\n\nThird, it determines the proportionality of a statute limiting a\n\nconstitutional right. Thus, if an enactment puts limitation on a\n\nconstitutional right and such limitation is disproportionate, such a\n\nstatute can be held to be unconstitutional by applying the doctrine\n\nof proportionality.\n\n(r) As per Dworkin, there are two principles about the concept\n\nof human dignity, First principle regards an ‘intrinsic value’ of\n\nevery person, namely, every person has a special objective value\n\nwhich value is not only important to that person alone but success\n\nor failure of the lives of every person is important to all of us. It\n\ncan also be described as self respect which represents the free\n\nwill of the person, her capacity to think for herself and to control\n\nher own life. The second principle is that of ‘personal\n\nresponsibility’, which means every person has the responsibility\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 536 of 567\n\nfor success in her own life and, therefore, she must use her\n\ndiscretion regarding the way of life that will be successful from her\n\npoint of view.\n\n(s) Sum total of this exposition can be defined by explaining\n\nthat as per the aforesaid view dignity is to be treated as\n\n‘empowerment’ which makes a triple demand in the name of\n\n‘respect’ for human dignity, namely:\n\n(i) respect for one's capacity as an agent to make one's own\n\nfree choices;\n\n(ii) respect for the choices so made; and\n\n(iii) respect for one's need to have a context and conditions\n\nin which one can operate as a source of free and informed\n\nchoice.\n\n(t) In the entire formulation of dignity right, ‘respect’ for an\n\nindividual is the fulcrum, which is based on the principle of\n\nfreedom and capacity to make choices and a good or just social\n\norder is one which respects dignity via assuring ‘contexts’ and\n\n‘conditions’ as the ‘source of free and informed choice’. The\n\naforesaid discourse on the concept of human dignity is from an\n\nindividual point of view. That is the emphasis of the petitioners as\n\nwell. That would be one side of the coin. A very important\n\nfeature which the present case has brought into focus is another\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 537 of 567\n\ndimension of human dignity, namely, in the form of ‘common\n\ngood’ or ‘public good’. Thus, our endeavour here is to give richer\n\nand more nuanced understanding to the concept of human\n\ndignity.\n\n(u) We, therefore, have to keep in mind humanistic concept of\n\nHuman Dignity which is to be accorded to a particular segment of\n\nthe society and, in fact, a large segment. Their human dignity is\n\nbased on the socio-economic rights that are read in to the\n\nFundamental Rights as already discussed above.\n\nWhen we read socio-economic rights into human dignity,\n\nthe community approach also assumes importance along with\n\nindividualistic approach to human dignity. It has now been well\n\nrecognised that at its core, human dignity contains three\n\nelements, namely, Intrinsic Value, Autonomy and Community\n\nValue. These are known as core values of human dignity. These\n\nthree elements can assist in structuring legal reasoning and\n\njustifying judicial choices in ‘hard cases’.\n\n(v) When it comes to dignity as a community value, it\n\nemphasises the role of the community in establishing collective\n\ngoals and restrictions on individual freedoms and rights on behalf\n\nof a certain idea of good life. The relevant question here is in\n\nwhat circumstances and to what degree should these actions be\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 538 of 567\n\nregarded as legitimate in a constitutional democracy? The liberal\n\npredicament that the state must be neutral with regard to different\n\nconceptions of the good in a plural society is not incompatible, of\n\ncourse, with limitation resulting from the necessary coexistence of\n\ndifferent views and potentially conflicting rights. Such\n\ninterferences, however, must be justified on grounds of a\n\nlegitimate idea of justice, an “overlapping consensus” 158 that can\n\nbe shared by most individuals and groups. Whenever such\n\ntension arises, the task of balancing is to be achieved by the\n\nCourts.\n\nWe would like to highlight one more significant feature\n\nwhich the issues involved in the present case bring about. It is\n\nthe balancing of two facets of dignity of the same individual.\n\nWhereas, on the one hand, right of personal autonomy is a part of\n\ndignity (and right to privacy), another part of dignity of the same\n\nindividual is to lead a dignified life as well (which is again a facet\n\nof\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution). Therefore, in a scenario where\n\nthe State is coming out with welfare schemes, which strive at\n\ngiving dignified life in harmony with human dignity and in the\n\nprocess some aspect of autonomy is sacrificed, the balancing of\n\nthe two becomes an important task which is to be achieved by the\n158“Overlapping consensus” is a term coined by John Rawls that identifies basic ideas of justice\nthat can be shared by supporters of different religious, political, and moral comprehensive\ndoctrines.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 539 of 567\n\nCourts. For, there cannot be undue intrusion into the autonomy\n\non the pretext of conferment of economic benefits.\n\n(w) In this way, the concept of human dignity has been widened\n\nto deal with the issues at hand. As far as doctrine of\n\nproportionality is concerned, after discussing the approaches that\n\nare adopted by the German Supreme Court and the Canadian\n\nSupreme Court, which are somewhat different from each other,\n\nthis Court has applied the tests as\nlaid down in\nModern Dental\n\nCollege & Research Centre, which are approved in K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy as well. However, at the same time, a modification\n\nis done by focusing on the parameters set down of Bilchitz which\n\nare aimed at achieving a more ideal approach.\n\n447) After stating the aforesaid manner in which different issues that\n\narose are specified and discussed, these questions and\n\nconclusions thereupon are summarised below:\n\n(1) Whether the Aadhaar Project creates or has tendency to\ncreate surveillance state and is, thus, unconstitutional on this\nground?\n\nIncidental Issues:\n\n(a) What is the magnitude of protection that need to be\naccorded to collection, storage and usage of\nbiometric data?\n\n(b) Whether the Aadhaar Act and Rules provide such\nprotection, including in respect of data minimisation,\npurpose limitation, time period for data retention and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 540 of 567\n\ndata protection and security?\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) The architecture of Aadhaar as well as the provisions of the\n\nAadhaar Act do not tend to create a surveillance state. This is\n\nensured by the manner in which the Aadhaar project operates.\n\n(b) We have recorded in detail the powerpoint presentation that\n\nwas given by Dr. Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CEO of the Authority,\n\nwhich brings out the following salient features:\n\n(i) During the enrolment process, minimal biometric data in the\n\nform of iris and fingerprints is collected. The Authority does not\n\ncollect purpose, location or details of transaction. Thus, it is\n\npurpose blind. The information collected, as aforesaid, remains\n\nin silos. Merging of silos is prohibited. The requesting agency is\n\nprovided answer only in ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ about the authentication of\n\nthe person concerned. The authentication process is not\n\nexposed to the Internet world. Security measures, as per the\n\nprovisions of Section 29(3) read with Section 38(g) as well as\n\nRegulation 17(1)(d) of the Authentication Regulations, are strictly\n\nfollowed and adhered to.\n\n(ii) There are sufficient authentication security measures taken\n\nas well, as demonstrated in Slides 14, 28 and 29 of the\n\npresentation.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 541 of 567\n\n(iii) The Authority has sufficient defence mechanism, as\n\nexplained in Slide 30. It has even taken appropriate protection\n\nmeasures as demonstrated in Slide 31.\n\n(iv) There is an oversight by Technology and Architecture\n\nReview Board (TARB) and Security Review Committee.\n\n(v) During authentication no information about the nature of\n\ntransaction etc. is obtained.\n\n(vi) The Authority has mandated use of Registered Devices\n\n(RD) for all authentication requests. With these, biometric data is\n\nsigned within the device/RD service using the provider key to\n\nensure it is indeed captured live. The device provider RD service\n\nencrypts the PID block before returning to the host application.\n\nThis RD service encapsulates the biometric capture, signing and\n\nencryption of biometrics all within it. Therefore, introduction of\n\nRD in Aadhaar authentication system rules out any possibility of\n\nuse of stored biometric and replay of biometrics captured from\n\nother source. Requesting entities are not legally allowed to store\n\nbiometrics captured for Aadhaar authentication under\nRegulation\n\n17(1)(a)\nof the Authentication Regulations.\n\n(vii) The Authority gets the AUA code, ASA code, unique device\n\ncode, registered device code used for authentication. It does not\n\nget any information related to the IP address or the GPS location\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 542 of 567\n\nfrom where authentication is performed as these parameters are\n\nnot part of authentication (v2.0) and e-KYC (v2.1) API. The\n\nAuthority would only know from which device the authentication\n\nhas happened, through which AUA/ASA etc. It does not receive\n\nany information about at what location the authentication device\n\nis deployed, its IP address and its operator and the purpose of\n\nauthentication. Further, the authority or any entity under its\n\ncontrol is statutorily barred from collecting, keeping or maintaining\n\nany information about the purpose of authentication under\n\nSection 32(3) of the Aadhaar Act.\n\n(c) After going through the Aadhaar structure, as demonstrated\n\nby the respondents in the powerpoint presentation from the\n\nprovisions of the Aadhaar Act and the machinery which the\n\nAuthority has created for data protection, we are of the view that it\n\nis very difficult to create profile of a person simply on the basis of\n\nbiometric and demographic information stored in CIDR. Insofar as\n\nauthentication is concerned, the respondents rightly pointed out\n\nthat there are sufficient safeguard mechanisms. To recapitulate, it\n\nwas specifically submitted that there was security technologies in\n\nplace (slide 28 of Dr. Pandey’s presentation), 24/7 security\n\nmonitoring, data leak prevention, vulnerability management\n\nprogramme and independent audits (slide 29) as well as the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 543 of 567\n\nAuthority’s defence mechanism (slide 30). It was further pointed\n\nout that the Authority has taken appropriate pro-active protection\n\nmeasures, which included disaster recovery plan, data backup\n\nand availability and media response plan (slide 31). The\n\nrespondents also pointed out that all security principles are\n\nfollowed inasmuch as: (a) there is PKI-2048 encryption from the\n\ntime of capture, meaning thereby, as soon as data is given at the\n\ntime of enrolment, there is an end to end encryption thereof and it\n\nis transmitted to the Authority in encrypted form. The said\n\nencryption is almost foolproof and it is virtually impossible to\n\ndecipher the same; (b) adoption of best-in-class security\n\nstandards and practices; and (c) strong audit and traceability as\n\nwell as fraud detection. Above all, there is an oversight of\n\nTechnology and Architecture Review Board (TARB) and Security\n\nReview Committee. This Board and Committee consists of very\n\nhigh profiled officers. Therefore, the Act has endeavoured to\n\nprovide safeguards.\n\n(d) Insofar as use and protection of data is concerned, having\n\nregard to the principles enshrined in various cases, Indian and\n\nforeign, the matter is examined from the stand point of data\n\nminimisation, purpose limitation, time period for data retention,\n\ndata protection and security (qua CIDR, requisite entities,\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 544 of 567\n\nenrolment agencies and Registrars, authentication service\n\nagency, hacking, biometric solution providers, substantive\n\nprocedural or judicial safeguards). After discussing the aforesaid\n\naspect with reference to certain provisions of the Aadhaar Act, we\n\nare of the view that apprehensions of the petitioners stand\n\nassuaged with the striking down or reading down or clarification\n\nof some of the provisions, namely:\n\n(i) Authentication records are not to be kept beyond a period\n\nof six months, as stipulated in\nRegulation 27(1)\nof the\n\nAuthentication Regulations. This provision which permits\n\nrecords to be archived for a period of five years is held to\n\nbe bad in law.\n\n(ii) Metabase relating to transaction, as provided in\nRegulation\nof the aforesaid Regulations in the present form, is held\n\nto be impermissible, which needs suitable amendment.\n\n(iii) Section 33(1) of the Aadhaar Act is read down by clarifying\n\nthat an individual, whose information is sought to be\n\nreleased, shall be afforded an opportunity of hearing.\n\n(iv) Insofar as\nSection 33(2)\nof the Act in the present form is\n\nconcerned, the same is struck down.\n\n(v) That portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act which\n\nenables body corporate and individual to seek\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 545 of 567\n\nauthentication is held to be unconstitutional.\n\n(vi) We have also impressed upon the respondents, to bring\n\nout a robust data protection regime in the form of an\n\nenactment on the basis of Justice B.N. Srikrishna (Retd.)\n\nCommittee Report with necessary modifications thereto as\n\nmay be deemed appropriate.\n\n(2) Whether the Aadhaar Act violates right to privacy and is\nunconstitutional on this ground?\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) After detailed discussion, it is held that all matters pertaining\n\nto an individual do not qualify as being an inherent part of right to\n\nprivacy. Only those matters over which there would be a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy are protected by\nArticle 21.\n\nThis can be discerned from the reading of Paras 297 to 307 of the\n\njudgment.\n\n(b) The Court is also of the opinion that the triple test\nlaid down\n\nin\norder to adjudge the reasonableness of the invasion to privacy\n\nhas been made. The Aadhaar scheme is backed by the statute,\n\ni.e. the Aadhaar Act. It also serves legitimate State aim, which\n\ncan be discerned from the Introduction to the Act as well as the\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons which reflect that the aim in\n\npassing the Act was to ensure that social benefit schemes reach\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 546 of 567\n\nthe deserving community. The Court noted that the failure to\n\nestablish identity of an individual has proved to be a major\n\nhindrance for successful implementation of those programmes as\n\nit was becoming difficult to ensure that subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices reach the unintended beneficiaries in the absence of a\n\ncredible system to authenticate identity of beneficiaries. The\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons also discloses that over a\n\nperiod of time, the use of Aadhaar number has been increased\n\nmanifold and, therefore, it is also necessary to take measures\n\nrelating to ensuring security of the information provided by the\n\nindividuals while enrolling for Aadhaar card.\n\n(c) It may be highlighted that the petitioners are making their\n\nclaim on the basis of dignity as a facet of right to privacy. On the\n\nother hand, Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act is aimed at offering\n\nsubsidies, benefits or services to the marginalised section of the\n\nsociety for whom such welfare schemes have been formulated\n\nfrom time to time. That also becomes an aspect of social justice,\n\nwhich is the obligation of the State stipulated in Para IV of the\n\nConstitution. The rationale behind\nSection 7\nlies in ensuring\n\ntargeted delivery of services, benefits and subsidies which are\n\nfunded from the Consolidated Fund of India. In discharge of its\n\nsolemn Constitutional obligation to enliven the Fundamental\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 547 of 567\n\nRights of life and personal liberty (\nArticle 21\n) to ensure Justice,\n\nSocial, Political and Economic and to eliminate inequality (Article\n\n14) with a view to ameliorate the lot of the poor and the Dalits, the\n\nCentral Government has launched several welfare schemes.\n\nSome such schemes are PDS, scholarships, mid day meals, LPG\n\nsubsidies, etc. These schemes involve 3% percentage of the\n\nGDP and involve a huge amount of public money. Right to\n\nreceive these benefits, from the point of view of those who\n\ndeserve the same, has now attained the status of fundamental\n\nright based on the same concept of human dignity, which the\n\npetitioners seek to bank upon. The Constitution does not exist for\n\na few or minority of the people of India, but “We the people”. The\n\ngoals set out in the Preamble of the Constitution do not\n\ncontemplate statism and do not seek to preserve justice, liberty,\n\nequality an fraternity for those who have the means and\n\nopportunity to ensure the exercise of inalienable rights for\n\nthemselves. These goals are predominantly or at least equally\n\ngeared to “secure to all its citizens”, especially, to the\n\ndowntrodden, poor and exploited, justice, liberty, equality and “to\n\npromote” fraternity assuring dignity. Interestingly, the State has\n\ncome forward in recognising the rights of deprived section of the\n\nsociety to receive such benefits on the premise that it is their\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 548 of 567\n\nfundamental right to claim such benefits. It is acknowledged by\n\nthe respondents that there is a paradigm shift in addressing the\n\nproblem of security and eradicating extreme poverty and hunger.\n\nThe shift is from the welfare approach to a right based approach.\n\nAs a consequence, right of everyone to adequate food no more\n\nremains based on Directive Principles of State Policy (Art 47),\n\nthough the said principles remain a source of inspiration. This\n\nentitlement has turned into a Constitutional fundamental right.\n\nThis Constitutional obligation is reinforced by obligations under\n\nInternational Convention.\n\n(d) Even the petitioners did not seriously question the purpose\n\nand bona fides of the Legislature enacting the law.\n\n(e) The Court also finds that the Aadhaar Act meets the test of\n\nproportionality as the following components of proportionality\n\nstand satisfied:\n\n(i) A measure restricting a right must have a legitimate goal\n(legitimate goal stage).\n\n(ii) It must be a suitable means of furthering this goal\n(suitability or rationale connection stage).\n\n(iii) There must not be any less restrictive but equally effective\nalternative (necessity stage).\n\n(iv) The measure must not have a disproportionate impact on\nthe right holder (balancing stage).\n\n(f) In the process, the Court has taken note of various\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 549 of 567\n\njudgments pronounced by this Court pertaining to right to food,\n\nissuance of BPL Cards, LPG connections and LPG cylinders at\n\nminimal cost, old age and other kind of pensions to deserving\n\npersons, scholarships and implementation of MGNREGA\n\nscheme.\n\n(g) The purpose behind these orders was to ensure that the\n\ndeserving beneficiaries of the scheme are correctly identified and\n\nare able to receive the benefits under the said scheme, which is\n\ntheir entitlement. The orders also aimed at ensuring ‘good\n\ngovernance’ by bringing accountability and transparency in the\n\ndistribution system with the pious aim in mind, namely, benefits\n\nactually reached those who are rural, poor and starving.\n\n(h) All this satisfies the necessity stage test, particularly in the\n\nabsence of any less restrictive but equally effective alternative.\n\n(i) Insofar as balancing is concerned, the matter is examined\n\nat two levels:\n\n(i) Whether, ‘legitimate state interest’ ensures ‘reasonable\n\ntailoring’? There is a minimal intrusion into the privacy and the\n\nlaw is narrowly framed to achieve the objective.\nHere the Act\n\nis to be tested on the ground that whether it is found on a\n\nbalancing test that the social or public interest and the\n\nreasonableness of the restrictions outweigh the particular\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 550 of 567\n\naspect of privacy, as claimed by the petitioners. This is the\n\ntest we have applied in the instant case.\n\n(ii) There needs to be balancing of two competing\n\nfundamental rights, right to privacy on the one hand and right\n\nto food, shelter and employment on the other hand.\n\nAxiomatically both the rights are founded on human dignity. At\n\nthe same time, in the given context, two facets are in conflict\n\nwith each other. The question here would be, when a person\n\nseeks to get the benefits of welfare schemes to which she is\n\nentitled to as a part of right to live life with dignity, whether her\n\nsacrifice to the right to privacy, is so invasive that it creates\n\nimbalance?\n\n(j) In the process, sanctity of privacy in its functional\n\nrelationship with dignity is kept in mind where it says that\n\nlegitimate expectation of privacy may vary from intimate zone to\n\nthe private zone and from the private to public arena.\n\nReasonable expectation of privacy is also taken into\n\nconsideration. The Court finds that as the information collected at\n\nthe time of enrolment as well as authentication is minimal,\n\nbalancing at the first level is met. Insofar as second level,\n\nnamely, balancing of two competing fundamental rights is\n\nconcerned, namely, dignity in the form of autonomy (informational\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 551 of 567\n\nprivacy) and dignity in the form of assuring better living standards\n\nof the same individual, the Court has arrived at the conclusion\n\nthat balancing at the second level is also met. The detailed\n\ndiscussion in this behalf amply demonstrates that enrolment in\n\nAadhaar of the unprivileged and marginalised section of the\n\nsociety, in order to avail the fruits of welfare schemes of the\n\nGovernment, actually amounts to empowering these persons. On\n\nthe one hand, it gives such individuals their unique identity and,\n\non the other hand, it also enables such individuals to avail the\n\nfruits of welfare schemes of the Government which are floated as\n\nsocio-economic welfare measures to uplift such classes. In that\n\nsense, the scheme ensures dignity to such individuals. This facet\n\nof dignity cannot be lost sight of and needs to be acknowledged.\n\nWe are, by no means, accepting that when dignity in the form of\n\neconomic welfare is given, the State is entitled to rob that person\n\nof his liberty. That can never be allowed. We are concerned with\n\nthe balancing of the two facets of dignity. Here we find that the\n\ninroads into the privacy rights where these individuals are made\n\nto part with their biometric information, is minimal. It is coupled\n\nwith the fact that there is no data collection on the movements of\n\nsuch individuals, when they avail benefits under\nSection 7\nof the\n\nAct thereby ruling out the possibility of creating their profiles. In\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 552 of 567\n\nfact, this technology becomes a vital tool of ensuring good\n\ngovernance in a social welfare state. We, therefore, are of the\n\nopinion that the Aadhaar Act meets the test of balancing as well.\n\n(k) Insofar as the argument based on probabilistic system of\n\nAadhaar, leading to ‘exclusion’ is concerned, the Authority has\n\nclaimed that biometric accuracy is 99.76% and the petitioners\n\nhave also proceeded on that basis. In this scenario, if the\n\nAadhaar project is shelved, 99.76% beneficiaries are going to\n\nsuffer. Would it not lead to their exclusion? It will amount to\n\nthrowing the baby out of hot water along with the water. In the\n\nname of 0.232% failure (which can in any case be remedied)\n\nshould be revert to the pre-Aadhaar stage with a system of\n\nleakages, pilferages and corruption in the implementation of\n\nwelfare schemes meant for marginalised section of the society,\n\nthe full fruits thereof were not reaching to such people?\n\n(l) The entire aim behind launching this programme is the\n\n‘inclusion’ of the deserving persons who need to get such\n\nbenefits. When it is serving much larger purpose by reaching\n\nhundreds of millions of deserving persons, it cannot be crucified\n\non the unproven plea of exclusion of some. It is clarified that the\n\nCourt is not trivialising the problem of exclusion if it is there.\n\nHowever, what we are emphasising is that remedy is to plug the\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 553 of 567\n\nloopholes rather than axe a project, aimed for the welfare of large\n\nsection of the society. Obviously, in order to address the failures\n\nof authentication, the remedy is to adopt alternate methods for\n\nidentifying such persons, after finding the causes of failure in their\n\ncases. We have chosen this path which leads to better\n\nequilibrium and have given necessary directions also in this\n\nbehalf, viz:\n\n(i) We have taken on record the statement of the learned\n\nAttorney General that no deserving person would be denied\n\nthe benefit of a scheme on the failure of authentication.\n\n(ii) We are also conscious of the situation where the\n\nformation of fingerprints may undergo change for various\n\nreasons. It may happen in the case of a child after she grows\n\nup; it may happen in the case of an individual who gets old; it\n\nmay also happen because of damage to the fingers as a result\n\nof accident or some disease etc. or because of suffering of\n\nsome kind of disability for whatever reason. Even iris test can\n\nfail due to certain reasons including blindness of a person.\n\nWe again emphasise that no person rightfully entitled to the\n\nbenefits shall be denied the same on such grounds. It would\n\nbe appropriate if a suitable provision be made in the\n\nconcerned regulations for establishing an identity by alternate\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 554 of 567\n\nmeans, in such situations.\n\n(m) As far as subsidies, services and benefits are concerned,\n\ntheir scope is not to be unduly expanded thereby widening the net\n\nof Aadhaar, where it is not permitted otherwise. In this respect, it\n\nis held as under:\n\n(i) ‘Benefits’ and ‘services’ as mentioned in\nSection 7\n\nshould be those which have the colour of some kind of\n\nsubsidies etc., namely, welfare schemes of the Government\n\nwhereby Government is doling out such benefits which are\n\ntargeted at a particular deprived class.\n\n(ii) It would cover only those ‘benefits’ etc. the\n\nexpenditure thereof has to be drawn from the Consolidated\n\nFund of India.\n\n(iii) On that basis, CBSE, NEET, JEE, UGC etc. cannot\n\nmake the requirement of Aadhaar mandatory as they are\n\noutside the purview of\nSection 7\nand are not backed by any\n\nlaw.\n\n(3) Whether children can be brought within the sweep of\nSections 7 and 8 of the Aadhaar Act?\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) For the enrolment of children under the Aadhaar Act, it\n\nwould be essential to have the consent of their parents/guardian.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 555 of 567\n\n(b) On attaining the age of majority, such children who are\n\nenrolled under Aadhaar with the consent of their parents, shall be\n\ngiven the option to exit from the Aadhaar project if they so choose\n\nin case they do not intend to avail the benefits of the scheme.\n\n(c) Insofar as the school admission of children is concerned,\n\nrequirement of Aadhaar would not be compulsory as it is neither a\n\nservice nor subsidy. Further, having regard to the fact that a child\n\nbetween the age of 6 to 14 years has the fundamental right to\n\neducation under\nArticle 21A\nof the Constitution, school admission\n\ncannot be treated as ‘benefit’ as well.\n\n(d) Benefits to children between 6 to 14 years under Sarv\n\nShiksha Abhiyan, likewise, shall not require mandatory Aadhaar\n\nenrolment.\n\n(e) For availing the benefits of other welfare schemes which are\n\ncovered by Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, though enrolment\n\nnumber can be insisted, it would be subject to the consent of the\n\nparents, as mentioned in (a) above.\n\n(f) We also clarify that no child shall be denied benefit of any of\n\nthese schemes if, for some reasons, she is not able to produce\n\nthe Aadhaar number and the benefit shall be given by verifying\n\nthe identity on the basis of any other documents. This we say\n\nhaving regard to the statement which was made by Mr. K.K.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 556 of 567\n\nVenugopal, learned Attorney General for India, at the Bar.\n\n(4) Whether the following provisions of the Aadhaar Act and\nRegulations suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality:\n\n(i)\nSections 2(c)\nand\n2(d)\nread with\nSection 32\n(ii)\n\nSection 2(h)\nread with\nSection 10\nof CIDR\n(iii)\nSection 2(l)\nread with\nRegulation 23\n(iv)\n\nSection 2(v)\n(v)\n\nSection 3\n(vi)\n\nSection 5\n(vii)\n\nSection 6\n(viii)\n\nSection 8\n(ix)\n\nSection 9\n(x)\n\nSections 11\nto\n(xi)\n\nSections 23\nand\n(xii)\nSection 23(2)(g)\nread with Chapter VI & VII –\nRegulations 27 to 32\n\n(xiii)\nSection 29\n\n(xiv)\nSection 33\n\n(xv)\nSection 47\n(xvi)\n\nSection 48\n(xvii)\n\nSection 57\n(xviii)\n\nSection 59\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a)\nSection 2(d)\nwhich pertains to authentication records, such\n\nrecords would not include metadata as mentioned in\nRegulation\n\n26(c)\nof the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, 2016.\n\nTherefore, this provision in the present form is struck down.\n\nLiberty, however, is given to reframe the regulation, keeping in\n\nview the parameters stated by the Court.\n\n(b) Insofar as\nSection 2(b)\nis concerned, which defines\n\n‘resident’, the apprehension expressed by the petitioners was that\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 557 of 567\n\nit should not lead to giving Aadhaar card to illegal immigrants.\n\nWe direct the respondent to take suitable measures to ensure\n\nthat illegal immigrants are not able to take such benefits.\n\n(c) Retention of data beyond the period of six months is\n\nimpermissible. Therefore,\nRegulation 27\nof Aadhaar\n\n(Authentication) Regulations, 2016 which provides archiving a\n\ndata for a period of five years is struck down.\n\n(d)\nSection 29\nin fact imposes a restriction on sharing\n\ninformation and is, therefore, valid as it protects the interests of\n\nAadhaar number holders. However, apprehension of the\n\npetitioners is that this provision entitles Government to share the\n\ninformation ‘for the purposes of as may be specified by\n\nregulations’. The Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations,\n\n2016, as of now, do not contain any such provision. If a provision\n\nis made in the regulations which impinges upon the privacy rights\n\nof the Aadhaar card holders that can always be challenged.\n\n(e)\nSection 33(1)\nof the Act prohibits disclosure of information,\n\nincluding identity information or authentication records, except\n\nwhen it is by an order of a court not inferior to that of a District\n\nJudge. We have held that this provision is to be read down with\n\nthe clarification that an individual, whose information is sought to\n\nbe released, shall be afforded an opportunity of hearing. If such\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 558 of 567\n\nan order is passed, in that eventuality, he shall also have right to\n\nchallenge such an order passed by approaching the higher court.\n\nDuring the hearing before the concerned court, the said individual\n\ncan always object to the disclosure of information on accepted\n\ngrounds in law, including\nArticle 20(3)\nof the Constitution or the\n\nprivacy rights etc.\n\n(f) Insofar as\nSection 33(2)\nis concerned, it is held that\n\ndisclosure of information in the interest of national security cannot\n\nbe faulted with. However, for determination of such an\n\neventuality, an officer higher than the rank of a Joint Secretary\n\nshould be given such a power. Further, in order to avoid any\n\npossible misuse, a Judicial Officer (preferably a sitting High Court\n\nJudge) should also be associated with. We may point out that\n\nsuch provisions of application of judicial mind for arriving at the\n\nconclusion that disclosure of information is in the interest of\n\nnational security, are prevalent in some jurisdictions. In view\n\nthereof,\nSection 33(2)\nof the Act in the present form is struck\n\ndown with liberty to enact a suitable provision on the lines\n\nsuggested above.\n\n(g) Insofar as\nSection 47\nof the Act which provides for the\n\ncognizance of offence only on a complaint made by the Authority\n\nor any officer or person authorised by it is concerned, it needs a\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 559 of 567\n\nsuitable amendment to include the provision for filing of such a\n\ncomplaint by an individual/victim as well whose right is violated.\n\n(h) Insofar as\nSection 57\nin the present form is concerned, it is\n\nsusceptible to misuse inasmuch as: (a) It can be used for\n\nestablishing the identity of an individual ‘for any purpose’. We\n\nread down this provision to mean that such a purpose has to be\n\nbacked by law. Further, whenever any such “law” is made, it\n\nwould be subject to judicial scrutiny. (b) Such purpose is not\n\nlimited pursuant to any law alone but can be done pursuant to\n\n‘any contract to this effect’ as well. This is clearly impermissible\n\nas a contractual provision is not backed by a law and, therefore,\n\nfirst requirement of proportionality test is not met. (c) Apart from\n\nauthorising the State, even ‘any body corporate or person’ is\n\nauthorised to avail authentication services which can be on the\n\nbasis of purported agreement between an individual and such\n\nbody corporate or person. Even if we presume that legislature\n\ndid not intend so, the impact of the aforesaid features would be to\n\nenable commercial exploitation of an individual biometric and\n\ndemographic information by the private entities. Thus, this part of\n\nthe provision which enables body corporate and individuals also\n\nto seek authentication, that too on the basis of a contract between\n\nthe individual and such body corporate or person, would impinge\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 560 of 567\n\nupon the right to privacy of such individuals. This part of the\n\nsection, thus, is declared unconstitutional.\n\n(i) Other provisions of Aadhaar Act are held to be valid,\n\nincluding\nSection 59\nof the Act which, according to us, saves the\n\npre-enactment period of Aadhaar project, i.e. from 2009-2016.\n\n(5) Whether the Aadhaar Act defies the concept of Limited\nGovernment, Good Governance and Constitutional Trust?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAadhaar Act meets the concept of Limited Government,\n\nGood Governance and Constitutional Trust.\n\n(6) Whether the Aadhaar Act could be passed as ‘Money Bill’\nwithin the meaning of\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution?\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) We do recognise the importance of Rajya Sabha (Upper\n\nHouse) in a bicameral system of the Parliament. The significance\n\nand relevance of the Upper House has been succinctly\n\nexemplified by this Court in Kuldip Nayar’s case. The Rajya\n\nSabha, therefore, becomes an important institution signifying\n\nconstitutional fedaralism. It is precisely for this reason that to\n\nenact any statute, the Bill has to be passed by both the Houses,\n\nnamely, Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha. It is the\n\nconstitutional mandate. The only exception to the aforesaid\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 561 of 567\n\nParliamentary norm is\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nHaving regard to this overall scheme of bicameralism enshrined\n\nin our Constitution, strict interpretation has to be accorded to\n\nArticle 110.\nKeeping in view these principles, we have\n\nconsidered the arguments advanced by both the sides.\n\n(b) The petitioners accept that Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act has\n\nthe elements of ‘Money Bill’. The attack is on the premise that\n\nsome other provisions, namely, clauses 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and 57\n\nof the Bill (which corresponds to Sections 23(2)(h), 54(2)(m) and\n\n57 of the Aadhaar Act) do not fall under any of the clauses of\n\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution and, therefore, Bill was not limited\n\nto only those subjects mentioned in\nArticle 110.\nInsofar as\n\nSection 7\nis concerned, it makes receipt of subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice subject to establishing identity by the process of\n\nauthentication under Aadhaar or furnish proof of Aadhaar etc. It\n\nis also very clearly declared in this provision that the expenditure\n\nincurred in respect of such a subsidy, benefit or service would be\n\nfrom the Consolidated Fund of India. It is also accepted by the\n\npetitioners that\nSection 7\nis the main provision of the Act. In fact,\n\nintroduction to the Act as well as Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons very categorically record that the main purpose of\n\nAadhaar Act is to ensure that such subsidies, benefits and\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 562 of 567\n\nservices reach those categories of persons, for whom they are\n\nactually meant.\n\n(c) As all these three kinds of welfare measures are sought to\n\nbe extended to the marginalised section of society, a collective\n\nreading thereof would show that the purpose is to expand the\n\ncoverage of all kinds of aid, support, grant, advantage, relief\n\nprovisions, facility, utility or assistance which may be extended\n\nwith the support of the Consolidated Fund of India with the\n\nobjective of targeted delivery. It is also clear that various\n\nschemes which can be contemplated by the aforesaid provisions,\n\nrelate to vulnerable and weaker section of the society. Whether\n\nthe social justice scheme would involve a subsidy or a benefit or\n\na service is merely a matter of the nature and extent of\n\nassistance and would depend upon the economic capacity of the\n\nState. Even where the state subsidizes in part, whether in cash\n\nor kind, the objective of emancipation of the poor remains the\n\ngoal.\n\n(d) The respondents are right in their submission that the\n\nexpression subsidy, benefit or service ought to be understood in\n\nthe context of targeted delivery to poorer and weaker sections of\n\nsociety. Its connotation ought not to be determined in the\n\nabstract. For as an abstraction one can visualize a subsidy being\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 563 of 567\n\nextended by Parliament to the King; by Government to the\n\nCorporations or Banks; etc. The nature of subsidy or benefit\n\nwould not be the same when extended to the poor and\n\ndowntrodden for producing those conditions without which they\n\ncannot live a life with dignity. That is the main function behind\n\nthe Aadhaar Act and for this purpose, enrolment for Aadhaar\n\nnumber is prescribed in Chapter II which covers Sections 3 to\n\n6. Residents are, thus, held entitled to obtain Aadhaar number.\n\nWe may record here that such an enrolment is of voluntary\n\nnature. However, it becomes compulsory for those who seeks to\n\nreceive any subsidy, benefit or service under the welfare scheme\n\nof the Government expenditure whereof is to be met from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India. It follows that authentication under\n\nSection 7\nwould be required as a condition for receipt of a\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service only when such a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice is taken care of by Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nTherefore,\nSection 7\nis the core provision of the Aadhaar Act and\n\nthis provision satisfies the conditions of\nArticle 110\nof the\n\nConstitution. Upto this stage, there is no quarrel between the\n\nparties.\n\n(e) On examining of the other provisions pointed out by the\n\npetitioners in an attempt to take it out of the purview of Money\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 564 of 567\n\nBill, we are of the view that those provisions are incidental in\n\nnature which have been made in the proper working of the Act.\n\nIn any case, a part of\nSection 57\nhas already been declared\n\nunconstitutional. We, thus, hold that the Aadhaar Act is validly\n\npassed as a ‘Money Bill’.\n\n(7) Whether\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 is\nviolative of right to privacy and is, therefore, unconstitutional?\n\nAnswer:\n\nValidity of this provision was upheld in the case of Binoy\n\nViswam by repelling the contentions based on\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The question of privacy which, at that time,\n\nwas traced to\nArticle 21\n, was left open. The matter is reexamined\n\non the touchstone of principles\nlaid down in\nK.S. Puttaswamy.\n\nThe matter has also been examined keeping in view that manifest\n\narbitrariness is also a ground of challenge to the legislative\n\nenactment. Even after judging the matter in the context of\n\npermissible limits for invasion of privacy, namely: (i) the existence\n\nof a law; (ii) a ‘legitimate State interest’; and (iii) such law should\n\npass the ‘test of proportionality’, we come to the conclusion that\n\nall these tests are satisfied. In fact, there is specific discussion\n\non these aspects in Binoy Viswam’s case as well.\n\n(8) Whether Rule 9 of the Prevention of Money Laundering\n(Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 and the notifications\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 565 of 567\n\nissued thereunder which mandates linking of Aadhaar with bank\naccounts is unconstitutional?\n\nAnswer:\n\n(a) We hold that the provision in the present form does not\n\nmeet the test of proportionality and, therefore, violates the right to\n\nprivacy of a person which extends to banking details.\n\n(b) This linking is made compulsory not only for opening a new\n\nbank account but even for existing bank accounts with a\n\nstipulation that if the same is not done then the account would be\n\ndeactivated, with the result that the holder of the account would\n\nnot be entitled to operate the bank account till the time seeding of\n\nthe bank account with Aadhaar is done. This amounts to\n\ndepriving a person of his property. We find that this move of\n\nmandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank account does not satisfy\n\nthe test of proportionality. To recapitulate, the test of\n\nproportionality requires that a limitation of the fundamental rights\n\nmust satisfy the following to be proportionate: (i) it is designated\n\nfor a proper purpose; (ii) measures are undertaken to effectuate\n\nthe limitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of the\n\npurpose; (iii) there are no alternative less invasive measures; and\n\n(iv) there is a proper relation between the importance of achieving\n\nthe aim and the importance of limiting the right.\n\n(c) The Rules are held to be disproportionate for the reasons\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012 & connected matters Page 566 of 567\n\nstated in the main body of this Judgment.\n\n(9) Whether Circular dated March 23, 2017 issued by the\nDepartment of Telecommunications mandating linking of mobile\nnumber with Aadhaar is illegal and unconstitutional?\n\nAnswer:\n\nCircular dated March 23, 2017 mandating linking of mobile\n\nnumber with Aadhaar is held to be illegal and unconstitutional as\n\nit is not backed by any law and is hereby quashed.\n\n(10) Whether certain actions of the respondents are in\ncontravention of the interim orders passed by the Court, if so, the\neffect thereof?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThis question is answered in the negative.\n\n448) In view of the aforesaid discussion and observations, the writ\n\npetitions, transferred cases, special leave petition, contempt\n\npetitions and all the pending applications stand disposed of.\n\n.............................................CJI.\n\n(DIPAK MISRA)\n\n.............................................J.\n(A.K.

Individually,\n\neach presents specific claims: of technology as the great enabler; and of\n\nbiometrics as the unique identifier. As recombinant elements, they create as it\n\nwere, new genetic material. Combined together, they present unforeseen\n\nchallenges for governance in a digital age. Part of the reason for these\n\nchallenges is that our law evolved in a radically different age and time. The\n\nlaw evolved instruments of governance in incremental stages. They were\n\nsuited to the social, political and economic context of the time. The forms of\n\nexpression which the law codified were developed when paper was\n\nubiquitous. The limits of paper allowed for a certain freedom: the freedom of\n\nindividuality and the liberty of being obscure. Governance with paper could\n\nlapse into governance on paper. Technology has become a universal\n\nlanguage which straddles culture and language. It confronts institutions of\n\ngovernance with new problems. Many of them have no ready answers.\n\n2 Technology questions the assumptions which underlie our processes of\n\nreasoning. It reshapes the dialogue between citizens and the state. Above all,\n\nit tests the limits of the doctrines which democracies have evolved as a shield\n\nwhich preserves the sanctity of the individual.\nPART A\n\n3 In understanding the interface between governance, technology and\n\nfreedom, this case will set the course for the future. Our decision must\n\naddress the dialogue between technology and power. The decision will\n\nanalyse the extent to which technology has reconfigured the role of the state\n\nand has the potential to reset the lines which mark off no-fly zones: areas\n\nwhere the sanctity of the individual is inviolable. Our path will define our\n\ncommitment to limited government. Technology confronts the future of\n\nfreedom itself.\n\n4 Granville Austin, the eminent scholar of the Indian Constitution had\n\nprescient comments on the philosophy of the Indian Constitution. He found it\n\nin three strands:\n\n“The Constitution…may be summarized as having three\nstrands: protecting and enhancing national unity and integrity;\nestablishing the institutions and spirit of democracy; and\nfostering a social revolution to better the mass of Indians...the\nthree strands are mutually dependent and inextricably\nintertwined. Social revolution could not be sought or gained at\nthe expense of democracy. Nor could India be truly\ndemocratic unless the social revolution had to establish a just\nsociety. Without national unity, democracy would be\nendangered and there would be little progress toward social\nand economic reform. And without democracy and reform, the\nnation would not hold together. With these three strands, the\nframers had spun a seamless web. Undue strain on, or\nslackness in any one strand would distort the web and risk its\ndestruction and, with it, the destruction of the nation.\nMaintaining harmony between the strands predictably would\npresent those who later work the Constitution with great\ndifficulties…”2\n\n2 Granville Austin, Working a Democratic Constitution: A History of the Indian Experience, Oxford University\nPress (2003) at page 6\nPART A\n\nThese three strands are much like the polycentric web of which Lon Fuller has\n\nspoken.3 A pull on one strand shakes the balance between the others. The\n\nequilibrium between them preserves the equilibrium of the Constitution.\n\n5 This Court has been tasked with adjudicating on the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the Aadhaar project. The difficulties that Granville Austin had\n\npredicted would arise in harmonising the strands of the “seamless web” are\n\nmanifested in the present case. This case speaks to the need to harmonise\n\nthe commitment to social welfare while safeguarding the fundamental values\n\nof a liberal constitutional democracy.\n\n6 To usher in a social revolution, India espoused the framework of a\n\nwelfare state. The Directive Principles are its allies. The state is mandated to\n\npromote the welfare of its citizens by securing and protecting as effectively as\n\npossible a social order in which there is social, economic and political justice.\n\nGovernment plays a vital role in the social and economic upliftment of the\n\nnation’s citizenry by espousing equitable distribution of resources and creating\n\nequal opportunities. These are ideals that are meant to guide and govern\n\nState action. The State’s commitment to improve welfare is manifested\n\nthrough the measures and programmes which it pursues.\n\n3 Lon L. Fuller and Kenneth I. Winston, The Forms and Limits of Adjudication, Harvard Law Review, Vol. 92,\n(1978), at pages 353-409\nPART A\n\n7 The Constitution of India incorporated a charter of human freedoms in\n\nPart III and a vision of transformative governance in Part IV. Through its rights\n\njurisprudence, this Court has attempted to safeguard the rights in Part III and\n\nto impart enforceability to at least some of the Part IV rights by reading them\n\ninto the former, as intrinsic to a constitutionally protected right to dignity. The\n\nDirective Principles are a reminder of the positive duties which the state has to\n\nits citizens. While social welfare is a foundational value, the Constitution is the\n\nprotector of fundamental human rights. In subserving both those ideals, it has\n\nweaved a liberal political order where individual rights and freedoms are at the\n\nheart of a democratic society. The Constitution seeks to fulfil its liberal values\n\nby protecting equality, dignity, privacy, autonomy, expression and other\n\nfreedoms.\n\n8 Two recent books have explored the complexities of human identity. In\n\n“The Lies That Bind: Rethinking Identity”4, Kwame Anthony Appiah states that\n\na liberal constitutional democracy is not a fate but a project. He draws\n\ninspiration from the Roman playwright Terence who observes: “I am human. I\n\nthink nothing human alien to me.” Francis Fukuyama, on the other hand has a\n\ndistinct nuance about identity. In “Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the\n\nPolitics of Enlightenment5, he writes about how nations can facilitate\n\n“integrative national identities” based on liberal democratic values. Reviewing\n\nthe books, Anand Giridharadas noted that Fukuyama’s sense of identity is\n\n4 Kwame Anthony Appiah, The Lies That Bind: Rethinking Identity, Liveright Publishing (2018).\n5 Francis Fukuyama, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Enlightenment, Farrar, Straus and\nGiroux (2018).\nPART A\n\n“large enough to be inclusive but small enough to give people a real sense of\n\nagency over their society.”6. Appiah and Fukuyama present two variants – for\n\nAppiah it has a cosmopolitan and global nature while it is more integrated with\n\na nation state, for Fukuyama, though firmly rooted in a liberal constitutional\n\norder.\n\n9 India has participated in and benefited from the reconfiguring of\n\ntechnology by the global community. We live in an age of information and are\n\nwitness to a technological revolution that pervades almost every aspect of our\n\nlives. Redundancies and obsolescence are as ubiquitous as technology itself.\n\nTechnology is a great enabler. Technology can be harnessed by the State in\n\nfurthering access to justice and fostering good governance.\n\n10 In an age symbolised by an information revolution, society is witnessing\n\na shift to a knowledge economy7. In a knowledge economy, growth is\n\ndependent on the ‘quantity, quality, and accessibility’8 of information. The\n\nquest for digital India must nonetheless be cognisant of the digital divide.\n\nAccess confronts serious impediments. Large swathes of the population have\n\nlittle or no access to the internet or to the resources required for access to\n\ninformation. With the growth of the knowledge economy, our constitutional\n\njurisprudence has expanded privacy rights. A digital nation must not submerge\n\n6 Anand Giridharadas, ‘What is Identity?’, The New York Times, 27 August, 2018.\n7 Peter F Drucker, The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines to Our Changing Society, Harper & Row (1969).\nDrucker’s book popularized the term ‘Knowledge Economy’.\n8 ‘What is Knowledge Economy?’, IGI Global: Disseminator of Knowledge, available at:\n\nhttps://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/indigenous-knowledges-and-knowledge-codification-in-the-knowledge-\neconomy/16327\nPART A\n\nthe identities of a digitised citizen. While data is the new oil, it still eludes the\n\nlife of the average citizen. If access to welfare entitlements is tagged to unique\n\ndata sets, skewed access to informational resources should not lead to\n\nperpetuating the pre-existing inequalities of access to public resources. An\n\nidentification project that involves the collection of the biometric and\n\ndemographic information of 1.3 billion people9, creating the largest biometric\n\nidentity project in the world, must be scrutinized carefully to assess its\n\ncompliance with human rights.\n\n11 Empowered by the technology that accompanied the advent of the\n\ninformation age, the Aadhaar project was envisioned and born. The project is\n\na centralised nation-wide identification system based on biometric technology.\n\nIt aims to be a game changer in the delivery of welfare benefits through the\n\nuse of technology. The project seeks to facilitate de-duplication, prevent\n\nrevenue leakages and ensure a more cost and time efficient procedure for\n\nidentification. Conceptualised on the use of biometrics and authentication, the\n\nAadhaar identity card was originally introduced as a matter of voluntary\n\nchoice. It was made a requirement for state subsidies and benefits for which,\n\nexpenses are incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India. It was later\n\nexpanded to become necessary to avail of a host of other services. The\n\nproject is multifaceted and expansive. Perhaps no similar national identity\n\nprogram exists in the world. The Aadhaar project has multifarious aspects, all\n\n9 Krishnadas Rajagopal, ‘Aadhaar in numbers: key figures from UIDAI CEO’s presentation to the Supreme\nCourt’, The Hindu, (March 22, 2018). Aadhaar enrollment as of March 2018 stood at over 1 billion.\nPART A\n\nof which have been the subject of a detailed challenge by the Petitioners.\n\nThey have been met with an equally strong defence from the government,\n\nwhich has argued that the programme is indispensable to curb corruption,\n\nfraud and black money.\n\n12 The Aadhaar project raises two crucial questions: First, are there\n\ncompeting interests between human rights and ‘welfare furthering technology’\n\nin democratic societies? Can technologies which are held out to bring\n\nopportunities for growth, also violate fundamental human freedoms? Second,\n\nif the answer to the first is in the affirmative, how should the balance be struck\n\nbetween these competing interests?\n\n13 Efficiency is a significant facet of institutional governance. But\n\nefficiencies can compromise dignity. When efficiency becomes a universal\n\nmantra to steam-roll fundamental freedoms, there is a danger of a society\n\ncrossing the line which divides democracy from authoritarian cultures. At the\n\nheart of the grounds on which the Aadhaar project has been challenged, lies\n\nthe issue of power. Our Constitution is a transformative document in many\n\nways. One of them is in defining and limiting the State’s powers, while\n\nexpanding the ambit of individual rights and liberties. It protects citizens from\n\ntotalitarian excesses and establishes order between the organs of the State,\n\nbetween the State and citizens and between citizens. Most importantly, it\n\nreaffirms the position of the individual as the core defining element of the\nPART A\n\npolity. That is the justification to restrain power by empowering all citizens to\n\nbe authors of their destiny. According to the Petitioners, the technological\n\npotential as well as the actual implementation of the Aadhaar project alters the\n\nbalance between the state and its citizens in this relational sphere and has the\n\npotential to permanently redistribute power within the constitutional\n\nframework.\n\n14 As far as citizen-state relations are concerned, the Constitution was\n\nframed to balance the rights of the individual against legitimate State interests.\n\nBeing transformative, it has to be interpreted to meet the needs of a changing\n\nsociety. As the interpreter of the Constitution, it is the duty of this Court to be\n\nvigilant against State action that threatens to upset the fine balance between\n\nthe power of the state and rights of citizens and to safeguard the liberties that\n\ninhere in our citizens.\nThe present case\ninvolves issues that travel to the heart of our\n\nconstitutional structure as a democracy governed by the rule of law. Among\n\nthem is the scope of this Court’s power of judicial review. The Aadhaar\n\nlegislation was passed as a money bill in the Lok Sabha. Whether it was\n\npermissible, in constitutional terms, to by-pass the Rajya Sabha, is the\n\nquestion. The role of the Rajya Sabha in a bicameral legislative structure, the\n\nlimits of executive power when it affects fundamental rights and the duty of the\nPART A\n\nstate to abide by interim orders of this Court are matters which will fall for\n\nanalysis in the case.\n\n16 The case is hence as much about the rule of law and institutional\n\ngovernance. Accountability is a key facet of the rule of law. Professor\n\nUpendra Baxi has remarked:\n\n“The problem of human rights, in situations of mass poverty,\nis thus one of redistribution, access and needs. In other\nwords, it is a problem of “development”, a process of planned\nsocial change through continuing exercise of public power. As\nthere is no assurance that public power will always, or even in\nmost cases, be exercised in favour of the deprived and\ndispossessed, an important conception of development itself\nis accountability, by the wielders of public power, to the\npeople affected by it and people at large. Accountability is the\nmedium through which we can strike and maintain a balance\nbetween the governors and the governed.”10\n\nThese are some of the unique challenges of this case. They must be analysed\n\nin the context of our constitutional framework. The all-encompassing nature of\n\nthe Aadhaar project, its magnitude and the resultant impact on citizens’\n\nfundamental rights, make it imperative to closely scrutinize the structure and\n\neffect of the project. For this will determine the future of freedom.\n\n10 Upendra Baxi, The Right To Be Human: Some Heresies, India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 13, (1986).\nPART B\n\nB The Puttaswamy11 principles\n\n17 A unanimous verdict by a nine judge Bench declared privacy to be\n\nconstitutionally protected, as a facet of liberty, dignity and individual\n\nautonomy. In a voluminous judgment, the Court traced the origins of privacy\n\nand its content. The decision lays down the test of proportionality to evaluate\n\nthe constitutional validity of restrictions on the right to privacy.\n\n18 The protection of privacy emerges both from its status as a natural right\n\ninhering in every individual as well as its position as “a constitutionally\n\nprotected right”. As a constitutional protection, privacy traces itself to the\n\nguarantee of life and personal liberty in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution as well as\n\nto other facets of freedom and dignity recognized and guaranteed by the\n\nfundamental rights contained in Part III.\n\nB.I Origins: privacy as a natural right\n\n19 Puttaswamy holds that the right to privacy inheres in every individual\n\nas a natural right. It is inalienable and attaches to every individual as a pre-\n\ncondition for being able to exercise their freedom. The judgment of four judges\n\n(with which Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul concurred) held :\n\n“42. Privacy is a concomitant of the right of the individual to\nexercise control over his or her personality. It finds an origin\n\n11 Justice K S Puttaswamy (Retd) v Union of India (“Puttaswamy”), (2017) 10 SCC 1\nPART B\n\nin the notion that there are certain rights which are\nnatural to or inherent in a human being. Natural rights are\ninalienable because they are inseparable from the human\npersonality.”12 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n“319. Life and personal liberty are not creations of the\nConstitution. These rights are recognised by the\nConstitution as inhering in each individual as an intrinsic\nand inseparable part of the human element which dwells\nwithin.”13 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn his concurring opinion, S A Bobde, J. opined:\n\n“392…Privacy, with which we are here concerned, eminently\nqualifies as an inalienable natural right, intimately\nconnected to two values whose protection is a matter of\nuniversal moral agreement: the innate dignity and autonomy\nof man.”14 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nSimilarly, in his concurring opinion, Nariman, J. opined:\n\n“532…It was, therefore, argued before us that given the\ninternational conventions referred to hereinabove and the fact\nthat this right inheres in every individual by virtue of his being\na human being, such right is not conferred by the Constitution\nbut is only recognized and given the status of being\nfundamental. There is no doubt that the petitioners are\ncorrect in this submission.”15\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn his concurring opinion, Abhay Manohar Sapre, J. opined:\n\n“557. In my considered opinion, “right to privacy of any\nindividual” is essentially a natural right, which inheres in\nevery human being by birth…It is indeed inseparable and\ninalienable from human being.”16\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n12 Ibid, at page 365\n13 Ibid, at page 508\n14 Ibid, at pages 536-537\n15 Ibid, at page 605\n16 Ibid, at page 614\nPART B\n\nThe judgment authoritatively settles the position. While privacy is recognized\n\nand protected by the Constitution as an intrinsic and inseparable part of life,\n\nliberty and dignity, it inheres in every individual as a natural right.\n\nB.2 Privacy as a constitutionally protected right : liberty and dignity\n\n20 The judgment placed the individual at the centre of the constitutional\n\nrights regime. The individual lies at the core of constitutional focus. The ideals\n\nof justice, liberty, equality and fraternity animate the vision of securing a\n\ndignified existence to the individual. The Court held that privacy attaches to\n\nthe person and not the place where it is associated. Holding that privacy\n\nprotects the autonomy of the individual and the right to make choices, the\n\njudgment of four judges held:\n\n“108….The individual is the focal point of the Constitution\nbecause it is in the realisation of individual rights that the\ncollective well being of the community is determined.\nHuman dignity is an integral part of the Constitution.17\n\n“266. Our Constitution places the individual at the\nforefront of its focus, guaranteeing civil and political\nrights in Part III and embodying an aspiration for\nachieving socio-economic rights in Part IV.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIt was held that privacy rests in every individual “irrespective of social class or\n\neconomic status” and that every person is entitled to the intimacy and\n\nautonomy that privacy protects:\n\n17 Ibid, at page 403\nPART B\n\n“271...It is privacy as an intrinsic and core feature of life and\npersonal liberty which enables an individual to stand up\nagainst a programme of forced sterilization. Then again, it is\nprivacy which is a powerful guarantee if the State were to\nintroduce compulsory drug trials of non-consenting men or\nwomen. The sanctity of marriage, the liberty of\nprocreation, the choice of a family life and the dignity of\nbeing are matters which concern every individual\nirrespective of social strata or economic well being. The\npursuit of happiness is founded upon autonomy and\ndignity. Both are essential attributes of privacy which\nmakes no distinction between the birth marks of\nindividuals.”18 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n21 Recognizing that civil-political rights are not subservient to socio-\n\neconomic rights, the Court held that “conditions necessary for realizing or\n\nfulfilling socio-economic rights do not postulate the subversion of political\n\nfreedom.”\n\n“266...The refrain that the poor need no civil and political\nrights and are concerned only with economic well-being has\nbeen utilised through history to wreak the most egregious\nviolations of human rights. Above all, it must be realised that it\nis the right to question, the right to scrutinize and the right to\ndissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinize the\nactions of government. Those who are governed are entitled\nto question those who govern, about the discharge of their\nconstitutional duties including in the provision of socio-\neconomic welfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to\nreason enables the citizens of a democratic polity to make\ninformed decisions on basic issues which govern their\nrights.19\n\n267... Conditions of freedom and a vibrant assertion of civil\nand political rights promote a constant review of the justness\nof socio-economic programmes and of their effectiveness in\naddressing deprivation and want. Scrutiny of public affairs is\nfounded upon the existence of freedom. Hence civil and\npolitical rights and socio-economic rights are complementary\nand not mutually exclusive.”20\n\n18 Ibid, at page 484\n19 Ibid, at pages 481-482\n20 Ibid, at page 482\nPART B\n\nSignificantly, the Court rejected the submission that there is a conflict between\n\ncivil-political rights and socio-economic rights. Both in the view of the Court\n\nare an integral part of the constitutional vision of justice.\n\n22 Privacy, it was held, reflects the right of the individual to exercise control\n\nover his or her personality. This makes privacy the heart of human dignity and\n\nliberty. Liberty and dignity are complementary constitutional entities. Privacy\n\nwas held to be integral to liberty. Privacy facilitates the realization of\n\nconstitutional freedoms. This Court held thus:\n\n“119. To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of the\nConstitution defined their vision of the society in which\nconstitutional values would be attained by emphasising,\namong other freedoms, liberty and dignity. So fundamental is\ndignity that it permeates the core of the rights guaranteed to\nthe individual by Part III. Dignity is the core which unites the\nfundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to\nachieve for each individual the dignity of existence. Privacy\nwith its attendant values assures dignity to the individual and\nit is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be\nof true substance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity\nand is a core value which the protection of life and liberty is\nintended to achieve.”21\n\n127...The right to privacy is an element of human dignity. The\nsanctity of privacy lies in its functional relationship with\ndignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can lead a life of\ndignity by securing the inner recesses of the human\npersonality from unwanted intrusion. Privacy recognises the\nautonomy of the individual and the right of every person to\nmake essential choices which affect the course of life. In\ndoing so privacy recognises that living a life of dignity is\nessential for a human being to fulfil the liberties and freedoms\nwhich are the cornerstone of the Constitution.”22\n\n21 Ibid, at pages 406-407\n22 Ibid, at page 413\nPART B\n\n23 The assurance of human dignity enhances the quality of life. The\n\n“functional relationship” between privacy and dignity secures the “inner\n\nrecesses of the human personality from unwanted intrusion”. Privacy by\n\nrecognizing the autonomy of an individual, protects the right to make choices\n\nessential to a dignified life. It thus enables the realization of constitutional\n\nliberties and freedoms. It was held in the judgment:\n\n“322. Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity.\nPrivacy has both a normative and descriptive function. At a\nnormative level privacy sub-serves those eternal values upon\nwhich the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are founded.\nAt a descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle of\nentitlements and interests which lie at the foundation of\nordered liberty.23\n\n298…Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within\nthe inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the\nConstitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate\nexpression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a\nconstitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of\nfundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of\nchoice and self-determination.”24\n\n24 Privacy is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The ability to\n\nmake choices is at the core of the human personality. Its inviolable nature is\n\nmanifested in the ability to make intimate decisions about oneself with a\n\nlegitimate expectation of privacy. Privacy guarantees constitutional protection\n\nto all aspects of personhood. Privacy was held to be an “essential condition”\n\nfor the exercise of most freedoms. As such, given that privacy and liberty are\n\nintertwined, privacy is necessary for the exercise of liberty. Bobde J, in his\n\nseparate opinion held that:\n\n23 Ibid, at page 508\n24 Ibid, at page 499\nPART B\n\n“409...Liberty and privacy are integrally connected in a way\nthat privacy is often the basic condition necessary for\nexercise of the right of personal liberty. There are\ninnumerable activities which are virtually incapable of being\nperformed at all and in many cases with dignity unless an\nindividual is left alone or is otherwise empowered to ensure\nhis or her privacy.25\n\n411... Both dignity and privacy are intimately intertwined and\nare natural conditions for the birth and death of individuals,\nand for many significant events in life between these events.\nNecessarily, then, the right of privacy is an integral part of\nboth ‘life’ and ‘personal liberty’ under\nArticle 21\n, and is\nintended to enable the rights bearer to develop her potential\nto the fullest extent made possible only in consonance with\nthe constitutional values expressed in the Preamble as well\nas across Part III.”26\n\n25 Apart from being a natural law right, the right to privacy was held to be a\n\nconstitutionally protected right flowing from\nArticle 21.\nPrivacy is an\n\nindispensable element of the right to life and personal liberty under\nArticle 21\n\nand as a constitutional value which is embodied in the fundamental freedoms\n\nembedded in Part III of the Constitution. Tracing out the course of precedent\n\nin Indian jurisprudence over the last four decades, the view of four judges\n\nholds:\n\n“103. The right to privacy has been traced in the decisions\nwhich have been rendered over more than four decades to\nthe guarantee of life and personal liberty in\nArticle 21\nand the\nfreedoms set out in Article 19.”27\n\n“320. Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which\nemerges primarily from the guarantee of life and personal\nliberty in\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution…”28\n\n25 Ibid, at page 543\n26 Ibid, at page 544\n27 Ibid, at page 401\n28 Ibid, at page 508\nPART B\n\nIn a similar vein, Chelameswar J. while concurring with the view of four judges\n\nheld:\n\n“375. The right to privacy is certainly one of the core\nfreedoms which is to be defended. It is part of liberty within\nthe meaning of that expression in Article 21.”29\n\n26 Being indispensable to dignity and liberty, and essential to the exercise\n\nof freedoms aimed at the self-realization of every individual, privacy was held\n\nto be a common theme running across the freedoms and rights guaranteed\n\nnot just by\nArticle 21\n, but all of Part III of the Constitution. Bobde J. in his\n\nseparate opinion held that:\n\n“406. It is not possible to truncate or isolate the basic freedom\nto do an activity in seclusion from the freedom to do the\nactivity itself. The right to claim a basic condition like privacy\nin which guaranteed fundamental rights can be exercised\nmust itself be regarded as a fundamental right. Privacy, thus,\nconstitutes the basic, irreducible condition necessary for\nthe exercise of ‘personal liberty’ and freedoms\nguaranteed by the Constitution. It is the inarticulate\nmajor premise in Part III of the Constitution.30\n\n415. Privacy is the necessary condition precedent to the\nenjoyment of any of the guarantees in Part III. As a result,\nwhen it is claimed by rights bearers before constitutional\ncourts, a right to privacy may be situated not only in\n\nArticle 21\n, but also simultaneously in any of the other\nguarantees in Part III. In the current state of things,\nArticles\n19(1)\n, 20(3)\n, 25\n, 28\nand\nare all rights helped up and made\nmeaningful by the exercise of privacy.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n29 Ibid, at page 531\n30 Ibid, at pages 541-542\nPART B\n\nB.3 Contours of privacy\n\n27 Privacy has been held to have distinct connotations including (i) spatial\n\ncontrol; (ii) decisional autonomy; and (iii) informational control. The judgment\n\nof four judges held that:\n\n“248. Spatial control denotes the creation of private spaces.\nDecisional autonomy comprehends intimate personal choices\nsuch as those governing reproduction as well as choices\nexpressed in public such as faith or modes of dress.\nInformational control empowers the individual to use privacy\nas a shield to retain personal control over information\npertaining to the person.”\n\nSimilarly, Nariman J. in his separate opinion held:\n\n“521. In the Indian context, a fundamental right to privacy\nwould cover at least the following three aspects:\n• Privacy that involves the person i.e. when there is\nsome invasion by the State of a person’s rights relatable to\nhis physical body, such as the right to move freely;\n• Informational privacy which does not deal with a\nperson’s body but deals with a person’s mind, and therefore\nrecognizes that an individual may have control over the\ndissemination of material that is personal to him.\nUnauthorised use of such information may, therefore lead to\ninfringement of this right; and\n• The privacy of choice, which protects an individual’s\nautonomy over fundamental personal choices.”31\n\n28 However, it was held that this is not an exhaustive formulation of\n\nentitlements. In recording its conclusions, the opinion of four judges held:\n\n“324. This Court has not embarked upon an exhaustive\nenumeration or a catalogue of entitlements or interests\ncomprised in the right to privacy. The Constitution must\nevolve with the felt necessities of time to meet the\nchallenges thrown up in a democratic order governed by\nthe rule of law. The meaning of the Constitution cannot be\n\n31 Ibid, at page 598\nPART B\n\nfrozen on the perspectives present when it was adopted.\n\nTechnological change has given rise to concerns which were\nnot present seven decades ago and the rapid growth of\ntechnology may render obsolescent many notions of the\npresent. Hence the interpretation of the Constitution must\nbe resilient and flexible to allow future generations to\nadapt its content bearing in mind its basic or essential\nfeatures.”32 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nAdditionally, Bobde J., in his separate opinion held that the right to privacy\n\nmay also inhere in other parts of the Constitution beyond those specified in\n\nthe judgment:\n\n“415. Therefore, privacy is the necessary condition precedent\nto the enjoyment of any of the guarantees in Part III. As a\nresult, when it is claimed by rights bearers before\nconstitutional courts, a right to privacy may be situated not\nonly in\nArticle 21\n, but also simultaneously in any of the other\nguarantees in Part III. In the current state of things,\nArticles\n19(1)\n, 20(3)\n, 25\n, 28\nand\nare all rights helped up and made\nmeaningful by the exercise of privacy. This is not an\nexhaustive list. Future developments in technology and\nsocial ordering may well reveal that there are yet more\nconstitutional sites in which a privacy right inheres that\nare not at present evident to us.”33 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nB.4 Informational privacy\n\n29 Puttaswamy held that informational privacy is an essential aspect of\n\nthe fundamental right to privacy. It protects an individual’s free, personal\n\nconception of the ‘self.’ Justice Nariman held that informational privacy “deals\n\nwith a person’s mind, and therefore recognizes that an individual may have\n\ncontrol over the dissemination of material that is personal to him”. Any\n\nunauthorised use of such information may therefore lead to infringement of the\n\n32 Ibid, at page 509\n33 Ibid, at page 545\nPART B\n\nright to privacy. In his concurring judgment, Justice Kaul held that\n\ninformational privacy provides the right to an individual “to disseminate certain\n\npersonal information for limited purposes alone”. Kaul J. in his separate\n\nopinion held:\n\n“620…The boundaries that people establish from others in\nsociety are not only physical but also informational. There\nare different kinds of boundaries in respect to different relations.\nPrivacy assists in preventing awkward social situations and\nreducing social frictions. Most of the information about\nindividuals can fall under the phrase “none of your business”. …\nAn individual has the right to control one’s life while submitting\npersonal data for various facilities and services. It is but\nessential that the individual knows as to what the data is\nbeing used for with the ability to correct and amend it. The\nhallmark of freedom in a democracy is having the\nautonomy and control over our lives which becomes\nimpossible, if important decisions are made in secret\nwithout our awareness or participation.”34 (Emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n30 A reasonable expectation of privacy requires that data collection does\n\nnot violate the autonomy of an individual. The judgment of four judges noted\n\nthe centrality of consent in a data protection regime. This was also highlighted\n\nin the separate concurring opinion of Justice Kaul:\n\n“625. Every individual should have a right to be able to\nexercise control over his/her own life and image as portrayed\nto the world and to control commercial use of his/her identity.\nThis also means that an individual may be permitted to\nprevent others from using his image, name and other aspects\nof his/her personal life and identity for commercial purposes\nwithout his/her consent.”35\n\n34 Ibid, at page 627\n35 Ibid, at page 629\nPART B\n\nConsent, transparency and control over information are crucial to\n\ninformational privacy. In this structure, Court has principally focused on the\n\n“individual” as central to our jurisprudence.\n\nB.5 Restricting the right to privacy\n\n31 There is an inherent importance of giving a constitutional status to\n\nprivacy. Justice Nariman dealt with this:\n\n“490...The recognition of such right in the fundamental rights\nchapter of the Constitution is only a recognition that such right\nexists notwithstanding the shifting sands of majority\ngovernments. Statutes may protect fundamental rights; they\nmay also infringe them. In case any existing statute or any\nstatute to be made in the future is an infringement of the\ninalienable right to privacy, this Court would then be required\nto test such statute against such fundamental right and if it is\nfound that there is an infringement of such right, without any\ncountervailing societal or public interest, it would be the duty\nof this Court to declare such legislation to be void as\noffending the fundamental right to privacy.”36\n\nA constitutional right may embody positive and negative ‘aspects’. They\n\nsignify mandates. At an affirmative level, they emphasise the content and\n\ndiversity of our liberties. As a ‘negative’, they impose restraints on the state\n\nand limit the power of the state to intrude upon the area of personal freedom.\n\n‘Negative’ in this sense reflects a restraint: the fundamental rights are a\n\nrestraining influence on the authority of power. In addition to keeping itself\n\nwithin the bounds of its authority, the state may have a positive obligation to\n\nperform. Rights such as informational privacy and data protection mandate\n\n36 Ibid, at pages 580-581\nPART B\n\nthat the state must bring into being a viable legal regime which recognizes,\n\nrespects, protects and enforces informational privacy. Informational privacy\n\nrequires the state to protect it by adopting positive steps to safeguard its\n\ncluster of entitlements. The right to informational privacy is not only vertical\n\n(asserted and protected against state actors) but horizontal as well.\n\nInformational privacy requires legal protection because the individual cannot\n\nbe left to an unregulated market place. Access to and exploitation of individual\n\npersonal data – whether by state or non-state entities – must be governed by\n\na legal regime built around the principles of consent, transparency and\n\nindividual control over data at all times.\n\n32 Privacy, being an intrinsic component of the right to life and personal\n\nliberty, it was held that the limitations which operate on those rights, under\n\nArticle 21\n, would operate on the right to privacy. Any restriction on the right to\n\nprivacy would therefore be subjected to strict constitutional scrutiny. The\n\nconstitutional requirements for testing the validity of any encroachment on\n\nprivacy were dealt with in the judgment as follows:\n\n“325… In the context of\nArticle 21\nan invasion of privacy must\nbe justified on the basis of a law which stipulates a procedure\nwhich is fair, just and reasonable. The law must also be valid\nwith reference to the encroachment on life and personal\nliberty under\nArticle 21.\nAn invasion of life or personal liberty\nmust meet the three-fold requirement of (i) legality, which\npostulates the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\nlegitimate state aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a\nrational nexus between the objects and the means adopted to\nachieve them.”37\n\n37 Ibid, at page 509\nPART B\n\nThese three-fold requirements emerge from the procedural and content-based\n\nmandate of\nArticle 21.\nThe first requirement is the enactment of a valid law,\n\nwhich justifies an encroachment on privacy. The second requirement of a\n\nlegitimate State aim ensures that the law enacted to restrict privacy is\n\nconstitutionally reasonable and does not suffer from manifest arbitrariness.\n\nThe third requirement of proportionality ensures that the nature and quality of\n\nthe encroachment on the right to privacy is not disproportionate to the purpose\n\nof the law. Proportionality requires the State to justify that the means which\n\nare adopted by the legislature would encroach upon the right to privacy only to\n\nthe minimum degree necessary to achieve its legitimate interest.\n\nJustice Nariman held thus:\n\n“495…Statutory provisions that deal with aspects of privacy\nwould continue to be tested on the ground that they would\nviolate the fundamental right to privacy, and would not be\nstruck down, if it is found on a balancing test that the social or\npublic interest and the reasonableness of the restrictions\nwould outweigh the particular aspect of privacy claimed. If this\nis so, then statutes which would enable the State to\ncontractually obtain information about persons would pass\nmuster in given circumstances, provided they safeguard the\nindividual right to privacy as well… in pursuance of a statutory\nrequirement, if certain details need to be given for the\nconcerned statutory purpose, then such details would\ncertainly affect the right to privacy, but would on a balance,\npass muster as the State action concerned has sufficient\ninbuilt safeguards to protect this right – viz. the fact that such\ninformation cannot be disseminated to anyone else, save on\ncompelling grounds of public interest.”38\n\n33 While five judges of the Court adopted the “proportionality” standard to\n\ntest a law infringing privacy, Justice Chelameswar discussed the need to\n\n38 Ibid, at page 583\nPART B\n\napply of a “compelling state interest” standard, describing it as the “highest\n\nstandard of scrutiny that a court can adopt”. Describing\nArticle 21\nas the\n\n“bedrock” of privacy, the learned Judge held:\n\n“379…If the spirit of liberty permeates every claim of privacy,\nit is difficult if not impossible to imagine that any standard of\nlimitation, other than the one under\nArticle 21\napplies.39\n\n380. The just, fair and reasonable standard of review under\n\nArticle 21\nneeds no elaboration. It has also most commonly\nbeen used in cases dealing with a privacy claim hitherto.\n\nGobind resorted to the compelling state interest standard in\naddition to the\nArticle 21\nreasonableness enquiry. From the\nUnited States where the terminology of ‘compelling state\ninterest’ originated, a strict standard of scrutiny comprises two\nthings- a ‘compelling state interest’ and a requirement of\n‘narrow tailoring’ (narrow tailoring means that the law must be\nnarrowly framed to achieve the objective). As a term,\ncompelling state interest does not have definite contours in\nthe US. Hence, it is critical that this standard be adopted with\nsome clarity as to when and in what types of privacy claims it\nis to be used. Only in privacy claims which deserve the\nstrictest scrutiny is the standard of compelling State\ninterest to be used. As for others, the just, fair and\nreasonable standard under\nArticle 21\nwill apply. When\nthe compelling State interest standard is to be employed\nmust depend upon the context of concrete cases.”40\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nJustice Chelameswar’s view accepts the ‘fair, just and reasonable’ standard in\n\nthe generality of cases, carving an exception in cases of a certain category\n\nwhere a heightened scrutiny must apply. Those categories of exception are\n\nnot spelt out. They would, as the judge opined, be evolved on a case by case\n\nbasis.\n\n39 Ibid, at page 532\n40 Ibid, at pages 532-533\nPART B\n\n34 The Bench of nine judges had held that the contours of privacy exist\n\nacross the spectrum of constitutionally protected freedoms. Privacy was held\n\nto be a necessary condition precedent to the enjoyment of the guarantees in\n\nPart III. This has enhanced the scope of the protection guaranteed to privacy.\n\nConsequently, privacy infringements will generally have to satisfy the other\n\ntests applicable apart from those under\nArticle 21.\nIn his concurring opinion,\n\nJustice S A Bobde held:\n\n“427. Once it is established that privacy imbues every\nconstitutional freedom with its efficacy and that it can be\nlocated in each of them, it must follow that interference\nwith it by the state must be tested against whichever one\nor more Part III guarantees whose enjoyment is curtailed.\nAs a result, privacy violations will usually have to answer to\ntests in addition to the one applicable to\nArticle 21\n, Such a\nview would be wholly consistent with R. C. Cooper v. Union of\nIndia.”41 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nAny attempt by the State to restrict privacy must therefore meet the\n\nconstitutional requirements prescribed for each provision of Part III, which the\n\nrestriction infringes. In his concurring opinion, Justice Nariman held thus:\n\n“488... Every State intrusion into privacy interests which deals\nwith the physical body or the dissemination of information\npersonal to an individual or personal choices relating to the\nindividual would be subjected to the balancing test\nprescribed under the fundamental right that it infringes\ndepending upon where the privacy interest claimed is\nfounded.”42 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nJustice Nariman further held:\n\n“526…when it comes to restrictions on this right, the drill\nof various Articles to which the right relates must be\nscrupulously followed. For example, if the restraint on\nprivacy is over fundamental personal choices that an\n\n41 Ibid, at page 549\n42 Ibid, at page 580\nPART B\n\nindividual is to make, State action can be restrained under\n\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 14\nif it is arbitrary and\nunreasonable; and under\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 19(1)(a)\n\nonly if it relates to the subjects mentioned in\nArticle 19(2)\nand\nthe tests laid down by this Court for such legislation or\nsubordinate legislation to pass muster under the said Article.\n\nEach of the tests evolved by this Court, qua legislation or\nexecutive action, under\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 14;\nor\n\nArticle 21\nread with\nArticle 19(1) (a)\nin the aforesaid examples\nmust be met in order that State action must pass muster.”43\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe constitutional guarantee on protection of privacy was placed on a sure\n\nfoundation. Since emanations of privacy are traceable to various rights\n\nguaranteed by Part III, a law or executive action which encroaches on privacy\n\nmust meet the requirements of the constitutionally permissible restriction in\n\nrelation to each of the fundamental rights where the claim is founded.\n\nB.6 Legitimate state interests\n\n35 Recognizing that the right to privacy is not absolute, the judgment\n\nrecognizes that legitimate state interests may be a valid ground for the\n\ncurtailment of the right subject to the tests laid down for the protection of\n\nrights. Justice Nariman held:\n\n“526...This right is subject to reasonable regulations made by\nthe State to protect legitimate State interests or public\ninterest. However, when it comes to restrictions on this right,\nthe drill of various Articles to which the right relates must be\nscrupulously followed.”44\n\n43 Ibid, at page 601\n44 Ibid, at page 601\nPART B\n\nRecognizing that a legitimate state aim is a pre-requisite for any restriction on\n\nthe right, the judgment of four judges held:\n\n“310…the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate\nstate aim, ensures that the nature and content of the law\nwhich imposes the restriction falls within the zone of\nreasonableness mandated by\nArticle 14\n, which is a guarantee\nagainst arbitrary state action. The pursuit of a legitimate state\naim ensures that the law does not suffer from manifest\narbitrariness.”\n\n36 The judgment sets out illustrations of legitimate State interests. The\n\nprovisos to various fundamental rights were held to be an obvious restriction\n\non the right to privacy. It was held that the State does have a legitimate\n\ninterest in collection and storage of private information when it is related to\n\nsecurity of the nation. Apart from the concerns of national security, an\n\nimportant State interest, it was held, lies in ensuring that scarce public\n\nresources reach the beneficiaries for whom they are intended. It was held\n\nthus:\n\n“311...Allocation of resources for human development is\ncoupled with a legitimate concern that the utilisation of\nresources should not be siphoned away for extraneous\npurposes… Data mining with the object of ensuring that\nresources are properly deployed to legitimate beneficiaries is\na valid ground for the state to insist on the collection of\nauthentic data.”45\n\nPrevention and investigation of crime, protection of the revenue and public\n\nhealth were demarcated as being part of other legitimate aims of the State.\n\nThe judgment places an obligation on the State to ensure that while its\n\nlegitimate interests are duly preserved the data which the State collects is\n\n45 Ibid, at page 505\nPART B\n\nused only for the legitimate purposes of the State and is “not to be utilised\n\nunauthorizedly for extraneous purposes.”\n\n37 However, reiterating that every facet of privacy is to be protected, the\n\njudgment held that there should be a careful balance between individual\n\ninterests and legitimate concerns of the state. Justice Nariman, in his separate\n\nopinion held:\n\n“488. Every State intrusion into privacy interests which deals\nwith the physical body or the dissemination of information\npersonal to an individual or personal choices relating to the\nindividual would be subjected to the balancing test prescribed\nunder the fundamental right that it infringes depending upon\nwhere the privacy interest claimed is founded.”46\n\n38 The judgment in Puttaswamy recognizes the right to privacy as a\n\nconstitutional guarantee protected as intrinsic to the freedoms guaranteed by\n\nPart III of the Constitution. Privacy is integral to the realization of human\n\ndignity and liberty. A society which protects privacy, values the worth of\n\nindividual self-realization. For it is in the abyss of solitude that the innermost\n\nrecesses of the mind find solace to explore within and beyond.\n\n46 Ibid, at page 580\nPART C\n\nC Submissions\n\nC.I Petitioners’ submissions\n\nThe petitioners challenge the constitutional validity of:\n\na. The Aadhaar programme that operated between 28.01.2009 till the coming\n\ninto force of the\nAadhaar Act, 2016\non 12.07.2016;\n\nb.\nThe Aadhaar Act, 2016\n(and alternatively certain provisions of the Act);\n\nc. Regulations framed under the\nAadhaar Act, 2016\n;\n\nd. Elements of the Aadhaar programme that continue to operate without the\n\ncover of the Act;\n\ne. Subordinate legislation including the Money Laundering (Amendment)\n\nRules, 2017;\n\nf. All notifications issued under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act in so far as they\n\nmake Aadhaar mandatory for availing of certain benefits, services and\n\nsubsidies; and\n\ng. Actions which made Aadhaar mandatory even where the activity is not\n\ncovered by\nSection 7\nof the Act.\n\nMr Shyam Divan, learned Senior Counsel submitted that the Aadhaar project\n\nand Act are ultra vires on the following grounds:\n\ni The project and the Act violate the fundamental right to privacy;\nPART C\n\nii The architecture of the Aadhaar project enables pervasive surveillance by\n\nthe State;\n\niii The fundamental constitutional feature of a ‘limited government’ - which is\n\nthe sovereignty of the people and limited government authority- is changed\n\ncompletely post Aadhaar and reverses the relationship between the citizen\n\nand the State;\n\niv Due to the unreliability of biometric technology, there are authentication\n\nfailures which lead to the exclusion of individuals from welfare schemes;\n\nv A citizen or resident in a democratic society has a choice to identify herself\n\nthrough different modes in the course of her interactions generally in\n\nsociety, as well as in her interactions with the State. Mandating\n\nidentification by only one mode is highly intrusive, excessive and\n\ndisproportionate and violates\nArticles 14\n, 19\nand\n21;\nand\n\nvi The procedure adopted by the State before and after the enactment of the\n\nlaw is violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nbecause:\n\na. There is no informed consent at the time of enrolment;\n\nb. UIDAI does not have control over the enrolling agencies and\n\nrequesting entities that collect sensitive personal information which\n\nfacilitates capture, storage and misuse of information; and\nPART C\n\nc. The data collected and uploaded into the CIDR is not verified by any\n\ngovernment official designated by UIDAI.\n\nMr Kapil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel submits that the provisions of the\n\nAadhaar Act are unconstitutional for the following reasons:\n\ni The aggregation and concentration of sensitive personal information under\n\nthe Aadhaar Act is impermissible because it is capable of being used to\n\naffect every aspect of an individual’s personal, professional, religious and\n\nsocial life. It is therefore violative of the individual freedoms guaranteed\n\nunder\nArticles 19(1)(a)\nto 19(1)(g), 21 and 25 of the Constitution;\n\nii Such aggregation of information is also an infringement of informational\n\nprivacy, which has been recognised in Puttaswamy;\n\niii Making Aadhaar mandatory unreasonably deprives citizens of basic rights\n\nand entitlements and infringes\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution;\n\niv Use of Aadhaar as an exclusive identity for availing of subsidies, benefits\n\nand services is disproportionate and violates\nArticle 14\nfor being arbitrary\n\nand discriminatory against persons otherwise entitled to such benefits;\n\nv Collection and storage of data with the government under the Aadhaar Act\n\nis violative of the right to protection from self-incrimination, and the right to\nPART C\n\nprivacy and personal dignity and bodily Integrity envisaged under\nArticle\n\n20(3)\nand\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution;\n\nvi To prescribe that Aadhaar is the only identity that enables a person to\n\nreceive entitlements is contrary to the right of an individual under the\n\nConstitution to identify the person through other prescribed documentation\n\nsuch as electoral rolls or passports;\n\nvii Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act is applicable only to such subsidies, benefits\n\nand services, for which the entire expenditure is directly incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India or from which the entire receipts directly form\n\npart of the Consolidated Fund of India;\n\nviii Use of Aadhaar as the sole identity will not prevent pilferage and diversion\n\nof funds and subsidies, as faulty identification is only one of the factors that\n\ncontributes to it; and\n\nix The Aadhaar project conditions the grant of essential benefits upon the\n\nsurrender of individual rights.\n\nMr Gopal Subramanium, learned Senior Counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\nPART C\n\ni The Aadhaar project violates dignity under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution as\n\nrecognised in the judgments- in Puttaswamy, NALSA47 and\n\nSubramanian Swamy48;\n\nii The Aadhaar project is unconstitutional as it seeks a waiver of\n\nfundamental rights;\n\niii The Aadhaar project violates the guarantees of substantive and\n\nprocedural reasonableness under Articles 14,19 and 21;\n\niv Aadhaar perpetrates exclusion from social security schemes and is\n\ntherefore discriminatory under\nArticle 14;\n\nv The Aadhaar Act lacks legitimacy in its object in so far as it validates a\n\nbreach of fundamental rights retrospectively;\n\nvi Rights and entitlements conferred under the Constitution cannot be based\n\non algorithmic probabilities which UIDAI cannot control;\n\nvii No consequence is prescribed for non-authentication under the Aadhaar\n\nAct;\n\nviii The Aadhaar Act violates Part IX of the Constitution, which provides for\n\ndecentralisation (to Panchayats), while the Aadhaar scheme strikes at the\n\nfederal structure of the Constitution; and\n\n47 (2014) 5 SCC 438\n48 (2016) 7 SCC 221\nPART C\n\nix Breaches under the Aadhaar Act cannot be cured.\n\nMr Arvind Datar, learned Senior Counsel has submitted:\n\ni Rule 9 of the PMLA (Second Amendment) Rules, 2017 which requires\n\nmandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts is unconstitutional and\n\nviolates\nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n, 21\nand\n300A\nof the Constitution, Sections 3,\n\n7 and 51 of the Aadhaar Act, and is also ultra vires of the provisions of\n\nthe\nPMLA Act, 2002\non the following grounds:\n\na. Under the impugned amended Rules, linkage of Aadhaar numbers to\n\nbank accounts is mandatory and persons not enrolling for Aadhaar\n\ncannot operate a bank account, which violates the spirit of\nArticle 14\nin\n\nentirety in so far it arbitrarily metes out unequal treatment based on\n\nunreasonable classification;\n\nb The impugned Rules are violative of\nArticle 19(1)(g)\nas the Rules refer\n\nto companies, firms, trusts, etc., whereas the Aadhaar Act is only to\n\nestablish identity of “individuals”;\n\nc Non-operation of a bank account, even for a temporary period, leads\n\nto deprivation of an individual's property and therefore constitutes a\n\nviolation under\nArticle 300A\nof the Constitution, which provides that\n\ndeprivation can be done only by primary legislation; and\nPART C\n\nd The Rule has no nexus to the object of the\nPMLA Act\n, as the Act has\n\nno provision to make bank accounts non-operational;\n\nii\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 is liable to be struck down as\n\nviolative of\nArticles 14\n, 21\nand\n19(g)\nof the Constitution;\n\niii The decision in Binoy Viswam v Union of India49 requires re-\n\nconsideration in view of the nine judge Bench decision in Puttaswamy;\n\niv In view of serious deficiencies in the Aadhaar Act, there is a need for\n\nguidelines under\nArticle 142\nto protect inter alia, the right to privacy and to\n\nimplement the mandate of the nine judge Bench in Puttaswamy;\n\nv If the Aadhaar project is not struck down, it should be confined only for\n\nidentification or authentication of persons who are entitled to subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services for which expenditure is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India;\n\nvi Sections 2(g), 2(j) 7, 57 and 59 of the Aadhaar Act violate\nArticles 14\n, 21\n\nand\n300A\nof the Constitution; and\n\nvii PMLA Rule 9 is arbitrary as it is contrary to the RBI Master Circular\n\n(issued in 2013), which provided a list of documents that were to be\n\ntreated as ‘identity proof’, in relation to proof of name and proof of\n\nresidence.\n\n49(2017) 7 SCC 59\nPART C\n\nMr P Chidambaram, learned Senior Counsel argued that the Aadhaar Act\n\ncould not have been passed as a Money Bill. Thus, he submitted:\n\ni The only difference between financial bills and money bills is the term\n\n“only” in\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution which implies that the scope of\n\nmoney bills is narrower than the scope of financial bills and provisions\n\nrelating to money bills must thus be construed strictly;\n\nii The Aadhaar Act, which was passed as a money bill, should be struck\n\ndown since many of its provisions such as\nSection 57\nhave no relation to\n\nthe nature of a Money Bill and bear no nexus to the Consolidated Fund of\n\nIndia;\n\niii Since Money Bills can only be introduced in the Lok Sabha, on account of\n\nthe curtailment of the powers of the Rajya Sabha and the President, the\n\nrelevant provisions must be accorded a strict interpretation;\n\niv While\nArticle 110(3)\nprovides that the decision of the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha as to whether a Bill is a ‘Money Bill’ shall be final, the finality is\n\nonly with regard to the Parliament and does not exclude judicial review;\n\nand\n\nv Since the legislative procedure is illegal and the power of the Rajya\n\nSabha has been circumvented to disallow legislative scrutiny of the\nPART C\n\nAadhaar bill, provisions of the Act cannot be severed to save the Act and\n\nthe Act is liable to be struck down as a whole by the Court.\n\nMr KV Vishwanathan, learned Senior Counsel made the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\ni All acts done prior to the passage of the Act are void ab initio and are not\n\nsaved or validated by\nSection 59\n. In any event,\nSection 59\nis invalid;\n\nii Collection, storage and use of data under the Aadhaar project and Act\n\nare invalid for the following reasons:\n\na. The Aadhaar Act and the surrounding infrastructure has made the\n\npossession of Aadhaar de facto mandatory;\n\nb. Compulsory collection of identity information violates various facets of\n\nthe right to privacy - bodily privacy, informational privacy and\n\ndecisional autonomy;\n\nc.\nThe Act\nis unconstitutional since it collects the identity information of\n\nchildren between 5-18 years without parental consent;\n\nd. Centralised storage of identity information and the unduly long period\n\nof retention of transaction data and authentication records is\n\ndisproportionate;\nPART C\n\ne.\nThe Act\nand Regulations preclude Aadhaar number holders from\n\naccessing or correcting their identity information stored on the CIDR;\n\nand\n\nf.\nThe Act\nand Regulations lack safeguards to secure sensitive personal\n\ndata.\n\niii Services like health related services, and those related to food, pensions\n\nand daily wages claimed under\nSection 7\nof the Act have been denied\n\nbecause of biometric failure. Biometric infrastructure operates on a\n\nprobabilistic system, which cannot be ‘one hundred percent infallible’.\n\nThus, the State needs to take steps to prevent the denial of benefits by\n\nadopting alternate methods for verification of identity. This is absent at\n\npresent, resulting in a violation of\nArticles 14\n\n& 21;\n\niv No provision is made for a hearing against omission and deactivation of\n\nthe Aadhaar number, which violates the principles of natural justice; and\n\nv Sections 2(g), 2(j), 2(k) and 23(2) of the Aadhaar Act suffer from\n\nexcessive delegation and the allied regulations are vague, manifestly\n\narbitrary and unreasonable.\n\nMr Anand Grover, learned Senior Counsel has submitted thus:\nPART C\n\ni The Aadhaar project extends far beyond the scope of the Aadhaar Act\n\nwith no procedural safeguards. Hence it violates\nArticle 21\nin as much as\n\nit is without the support and sanction of law. The data collected is\n\nunauthorised, excessive and being illegally shared;\n\nii The use of biometric technology to establish identity is uncertain,\n\nunproven and unreliable leading to exclusion and a violation of\nArticles 14\n\nand\n21;\n\niii The lack of security in the Aadhaar project violates the right to privacy\n\nunder\nArticle 21;\n\niv Excessive powers have been delegated to the UIDAI through the\n\nAadhaar Act; and\n\nv\nSections 33(2)\nand\nof the Act are vague, overbroad and\n\nconstitutionally invalid.\n\nMs Meenakshi Arora, learned Senior Counsel contended that:\n\ni The general and indiscriminate retention of personal data, including meta-\n\ndata, and the ensuing possibility of surveillance by the State has a chilling\n\neffect on fundamental rights like the freedom of speech and expression,\n\nprivacy, and dignity;\nPART C\n\nii Making Aadhaar the sole means of identification for various services\n\nimpinges upon dignity as it amounts to requiring a license for the exercise\n\nof fundamental rights; and\n\niii The Aadhaar project does not contain any specific provisions for data\n\nprotection, apart from a mere general obligation on UIDAI, which is a\n\nviolation of the obligation of the State to ensure that the right to life,\n\nliberty, dignity and privacy of every individual is not breached under Part\n\nIII of the Constitution.\n\nMr Sajjan Poovayya, learned Senior Counsel has urged the following\n\nsubmissions:\n\ni The Aadhaar Act fails to satisfy the constitutional test of a just, fair and\n\nreasonable law;\n\nii Maintenance of Aadhaar records by the State under\nSection 32\nis an\n\nunwarranted intrusion by the State;\n\niii Use of personal information under\nSection 33\nis an unwarranted intrusion\n\nby the State;\n\niv\nSection 57\nof the Act is contrary to the principle of purpose limitation; and\nPART C\n\nv\nSections 2(g)\nand\n2(j)\n, the proviso to\nSection 3(1)\n,\nSection 23(2)(g)\nand\n\nSection 23(2)(n)\nread with\nSection 54(2)(l)\n, and\nSection 29(4)\nof the Act\n\nsuffer from the vice of excessive delegation.\n\nMr CU Singh, learned Senior Counsel, argued that the rights of the child are\n\nviolated through the Aadhaar project. A child has no right to give consent or to\n\nenter into a contract. A child in India, under law, has no power or right to bind\n\nherself to anything, to consent or enter into contracts. In this background,\n\nthere is no compelling state interest to mandate Aadhaar for children. The\n\nfundamental right of a child to education cannot be made subject to production\n\nof Aadhaar. These requirements are not only contrary to domestic legislation\n\nprotecting the rights of children but also against India’s international\n\nobligations. Learned counsel also spoke of the violation of the rights of\n\nhomeless people who are denied benefits due to the lack of a fixed abode.\n\nMr Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior Counsel has urged that since there is no\n\n‘essential practice’ involved, exemptions must be allowed from the mandatory\n\nnature of the Aadhaar Act on the grounds of freedom of conscience under\n\nArticle 25\nof the Constitution.\n\nMs Jayna Kothari, learned Counsel arguing on behalf of an intervenor\n\norganization for transgender persons and sexual minorities urged that the\nPART C\n\nAadhaar Act discriminates against sexual minorities. Aadhaar Regulations\n\nrequire demographic information. The enrolment form has a third gender, but\n\nthere is no uniformity across the board, and the documents that have to be\n\nproduced to get an Aadhaar card do not always have that option. Aadhaar is\n\nbeing made mandatory for almost everything but transgender persons cannot\n\nget an Aadhaar because they do not have the gender identity documents that\n\nAadhaar requires. This non-recognition of gender identity leads to denial of\n\nbenefits which is violative of both\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n\nIt has also been argued before us in an intervention application that denial of\n\nAadhaar to Non-Resident Indians leads to discrimination when NRIs seek to\n\navail of basic services in India.\n\nC.2 Respondents’ submissions\n\nMr KK Venugopal, Learned Attorney General for India, has submitted thus:\n\ni. For the period prior to coming into force of the Aadhaar Act, because of\n\nthe interim orders passed by the SC, obtaining an Aadhaar number or\n\nenrollment number was voluntary, and hence there was no violation of\n\nany right;\n\nii. Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act protects all actions taken from the period\n\nbetween 2010 till the passage of the Aadhaar Act in 2016;\nPART C\n\niii. The judgments in MP Sharma and Kharak Singh being those of 8 and 6\n\njudges respectively, holding that the right to privacy is not a fundamental\n\nright, judgments of smaller benches delivered during the period upto\n\nPuttaswamy would be per incuriam. Hence, the State need not have\n\nproceeded on the basis that a law was required for the purpose of getting\n\nan Aadhaar number or an enrolment number. As a result, the\n\nadministrative actions taken would be valid as well as the receipt of\n\nbenefits and subsidies by the beneficiaries;\n\niv. Subsequent to the Aadhaar Act, the petitioners would have to establish\n\nthat one or more of the tests laid down by the nine judge bench in\n\nPuttaswamy render the invasion of privacy resulting from the Aadhaar\n\nAct unconstitutional. The tests laid down in Puttaswamy have been\n\nsatisfied and hence the Aadhaar Act is not unconstitutional for the\n\nfollowing reasons:\n\na. The first condition in regard to the existence of a law has been\n\nsatisfied;\n\nb. Legitimate state interests such as preventing the dissipation of social\n\nwelfare benefits, prevention of money laundering, black money and\n\ntax evasion, and protection of national security are satisfied through\n\nthe Act;\nPART C\n\nc. The Aadhaar Act satisfies the test of proportionality by ensuring that a\n\n“rational nexus” exists between the objects of the Act and the means\n\nadopted to achieve its objects; and\n\nd. For the purpose of testing legitimate State interest and proportionality,\n\nthe Court must take note of the fact that each one of the subsidies and\n\nbenefits under\nSection 7\nis traceable to rights under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution - such as the right to live with human dignity, the right to\n\nfood, right to shelter, right to employment, right to medical care and\n\neducation. If these rights are juxtaposed with the right to privacy, the\n\nformer will prevail over the latter.\n\nv. The Aadhaar Act was validly passed as a Money Bill on the following\n\ngrounds:\n\na. The term ‘targeted delivery of subsidies’ contemplates an expenditure of\n\nfunds from the Consolidated Fund of India, which brings the Aadhaar\n\nAct within the purview of a Money Bill under\nArt. 110\nof the Constitution;\n\nb.\nSections 7\n,\n,\nand the Preamble of the Act also support its\n\nclassification as a Money Bill;\n\nc. The Aadhaar Act has ancillary provisions, but they are related to the\n\npith and substance of the legislation which is the targeted delivery of\n\nsubsidies and benefits; and\n\nd.\nSection 57\nof the Act is saved by\nArticle 110 (1) (g)\nof the Constitution as\n\nit is a standalone provision and even if a Bill is not covered under\nPART C\n\nclauses (a) to (f) of Article110(1), it can still be covered under Article110\n\n(1) (g).\n\nMr Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General, submitted:\n\ni.\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, was examined in Binoy Viswam\n\nin the context of\nArticle 19\nand fulfills the three tests laid down under\n\nPuttaswamy as well as the test of manifest arbitrariness laid down in\n\nShayara Bano v Union of India50\n;\n\nii. The demographic information that is required for Aadhaar enrollment is\n\nalready submitted while obtaining a PAN card and therefore individuals\n\ndo not have a legitimate interest in withholding information;\n\niii. Linking Aadhaar to PAN is in public interest on the following grounds:\n\na. The State has a legitimate interest in curbing the menace of black\n\nmoney, money laundering and tax evasion, often facilitated by\n\nduplicate PAN cards, and the linking of Aadhaar to the PAN card will\n\nensure that one person holds only one PAN Card, thereby curbing\n\nthese economic offences;\n\nb. Aadhaar-PAN linking is in public interest and satisfies the test of\n\nproportionality and reasonableness;\n\n50 (2017) 9 SCC 1\nPART C\n\nc. The individual interest gives way to a larger public interest and a\n\nstatutory provision furthering state interest will take precedence over\n\nfundamental rights;\n\nd. The Court must not interfere with the Legislature’s wisdom unless the\n\nstatutory measure is shockingly disproportionate to the object sought\n\nto be achieved;\n\ne. India is a signatory to various international treaties under which it has\n\nobligations to take action to curb the menace of black money and\n\nmoney laundering in pursuance of which measures including the\n\namendments to inter alia the Income Tax Act and the PMLA Act and\n\nRules thereunder, have been brought about by the legislature;\n\nf. Statutory provisions under Aadhaar Act and Income Tax Act are distinct\n\nand standalone. Moreover, the validity of one provision cannot be\n\nexamined in the light of the other;\n\ng. Ascribing a (mandatory or voluntary) character to the provisions of a\n\nstatute is Parliament’s prerogative and cannot be questioned by\n\ncourts; and\n\nh. Rule 9 of the amended PMLA Rules that mandates furnishing of an\n\nAadhaar number to open a bank account is not ultra vires the Aadhaar\n\nAct. Similarly, the Rule that an existing bank account will become non-\n\noperational if not linked with Aadhaar within six months is not a\nPART C\n\npenalty but a consequence to render the accounts of money\n\nlaunderers non-operational.\n\nMr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel, has submitted:\n\ni. The right to privacy exists when there is a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy. However, this reasonable expectation of privacy differs from one\n\ndataset to another since the Aadhaar Act draws a distinction between\n\ndemographic information, optional demographic information (eg. mobile\n\nnumber), core biometric information (fingerprints and iris scans) and\n\nbiometric information such as photographs;\n\nii. Alternatively, the applicability of\nArticle 21\nhas to be confined and limited\n\nto core biometric information;\n\niii. Fundamental rights are not absolute and can be restricted if permitted\n\nspecifically.\nArticle 21\nexpressly envisages deprivation by laws which\n\nseek to carry out legitimate objectives and are reasonable and\n\nproportionate;\n\niv. The Aadhaar Act does not cause exclusion because if authentication fails\n\nafter multiple attempts, then the subsidies, benefits and services, can be\n\navailed of by proving the possession of an Aadhaar number, either by\nPART C\n\nproducing the Aadhaar card or by producing the receipt of the application\n\nfor enrolment and producing the enrolment ID number;\n\nv. Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act protects the right to human dignity\n\nrecognized by\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution by providing services,\n\nbenefits and subsidies. The Aadhaar Act is a welfare scheme in\n\npursuance of the State’s obligation to respect the fundamental rights to\n\nlife and personal liberty; to ensure justice (social, political and economic)\n\nand to eliminate inequality (\nArticle 14\n) with a view to ameliorate the lot of\n\nthe poor and the Dalits;\n\nvi. Socio-economic rights must be read into Part III of the Constitution since\n\ncivil and political rights cannot be enjoyed without strengthening socio -\n\neconomic rights;\n\nvii. A welfare State has a duty to ensure that each citizen has access at least\n\nto the basic necessities of life. The idea of a socialist state under a\n\nmandate to secure justice- social, economic and political - will be\n\ncompletely illusory if it fails to secure for its citizens the basic\n\nnecessities in life. There cannot be any dignity for those who suffer\n\nstarvation, subjugation, deprivation and marginalization and those who\n\nare compelled to do work which is intrinsically below human dignity;\nPART C\n\nviii. The Aadhaar number does not convert individuals to numbers. The\n\nAadhaar number is necessary for authentication and it is solely used for\n\nthat purpose. The petitioners have conflated the concepts of identity and\n\nidentification. Authentication through a number is merely a technological\n\nrequirement which does not alter the identity of an individual;\n\nix. Even if there is a conflict between the right to privacy and the right to food\n\nand shelter, the Aadhaar Act strikes a fair balance. The Aadhaar Act\n\nensures human dignity and the right to life and liberty, hence there would\n\nbe no reasonable expectation of privacy and autonomy;\n\nx. The requirement to obtain an Aadhaar number under the Aadhaar Act\n\ndoes not reflect a lack of trust in citizens. Authentication by the State\n\ndoes not presume that all its citizens are dishonest. The provisions of the\n\nAadhaar Act are merely regulatory in nature - similar to the process of\n\nfrisking at airports or other offices - since there is no effective method to\n\nensure targeted delivery;\n\nxi. The “least intrusive test” is not applicable in the present case. The\n\nrequirement that the least intrusive means of achieving the State object\n\nmust be adopted, has been rejected by Indian courts in a catena of\n\ndecisions as it involves a value judgment and second guessing the\n\nwisdom of the legislature. Such a test violates the separation of powers\n\nbetween the legislature and the judiciary;\nPART C\n\nxii. Even assuming that the ‘least intrusive method’ test applies, the exercise\n\nof determining the least intrusive method of identification is a technical\n\nexercise and cannot be undertaken in a court of law;\n\nxiii. The Petitioners who have furnished smartcards as an alternative to the\n\nAadhaar card, have not established that smartcards are less intrusive\n\nthan the Aadhaar card authentication process;\n\nxiv. The ‘strict scrutiny test’ does not apply to the Aadhaar Act. That test is\n\nconceptualised in the United States, to be only applied to ‘suspect\n\nclassifications’;\n\nxv. Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act does not involve any waiver of fundamental\n\nrights;\n\nxvi. There can be no assumption of mala fide against the government or the\n\nlegislature. A mere possibility of abuse is not a ground to invalidate the\n\nAadhaar Act;\n\nxvii. Through\nSection 57\n, Parliament intended to make the use of the Aadhaar\n\nnumber available for other purposes due to the liberalization and\n\nprivatization of the economy in areas earlier occupied by the government\n\nand public sector. Many private corporate bodies are operating parallel to\n\nand in competition with the public sector such as in banking, insurance,\nPART C\n\ndefence, and health. These are core sectors absolutely essential for\n\nnational integrity, to the national economy and the life of people;\n\nxviii.\nSections 2(g)\n, and (j) read with\nSection 54(2)(a)\nand\nSection 54(1)\ndo not\n\nsuffer from excessive delegation of power to UIDAI and there are\n\nsufficient guidelines coupled with restrictions. The regulation making\n\npower of the Authority under the Act is limited by the use of the\n\nexpression ‘such other biological attribute’ which will be interpreted\n\nejusdem generis with the categories of information mentioned before\n\nnamely, fingerprints and iris scan. These categories have certain\n\ncharacteristics: firstly, they do not contain genetic information; secondly,\n\nthey are non-intrusive; thirdly, apart from carrying out authentication they\n\ndo not reveal any other information of the individual; fourthly, these are\n\nmodes of identification used for identifying a person even without digital\n\ntechnology; fifthly, they are capable of being used for instantaneous\n\ndigital authentication; and sixthly, they are biological attributes enabling\n\ndigital authentication. The addition of biological attributes, under\nSection\n, must mandatorily be laid before the Parliament under\nSection 55\n. This\n\nis an additional check on the regulation making power of UIDAI;\n\nxix. Under\nSection 2(k)\n, which defines demographic information, certain\n\nsensitive categories of information such as ‘race, religion, caste, tribe,\n\nethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history’ of\nPART C\n\nthe person are excluded. The term ‘other relevant information’ has to be\n\nconstrued ejusdem generis and would have to be necessarily\n\ndemographic in nature as contrasted with biometric information;\n\nxx. Aadhaar is necessary, as 3% of India’s GDP amounting to trillions of\n\nrupees is allocated by Governments towards subsidies, scholarships,\n\npensions, education, food and other welfare programmes. But\n\napproximately half of if does not reach the intended beneficiaries.\n\nAadhaar is necessary for fixing this problem as no other identification\n\ndocument is widely and commonly possessed by the residents of the\n\ncountry and most of the other identity documents do not enjoy the quality\n\nof portability;\n\nxxi. The enrolment and authentication processes under the Aadhaar Act are\n\nstrongly regulated so that the data is secure;\n\nxxii. The security of the CIDR is also ensured through adequate measures and\n\nsafeguards;\n\nxxiii. The Aadhaar Act ensures that UIDAI has control over the requesting\n\nentity during the authentication process;\n\nxxiv. Enrolment Regulations ensure that the requirement of informed consent\n\nof individuals is fulfilled while securing the Aadhaar card in the following\n\nways:\nPART C\n\na. Firstly, the resident is given an opportunity of verifying his or her\n\ninformation for accuracy before uploading;\n\nb. Secondly, the details and the supporting documents are provided by\n\nthe resident, or an introducer (in specific cases);\n\nc. Thirdly, the enrolling agency is obliged to inform the individual about\n\nthe manner in which the information shall be used, the nature of\n\nrecipients with whom the information is to be shared during\n\nauthentication; and the existence of a right to access information, the\n\nprocedure for making request for such access and details of the\n\nperson/ department to whom a request can be made; and\n\nd. Fourthly, the uploading of information is done in the presence of the\n\nindividual.\n\nxxv. When an individual makes a choice to enter into a relational sphere then\n\nhis or her choice as to mode of identification would automatically get\n\nrestricted on account of the autonomy of the individuals or institution with\n\nwhom they wish to relate. This is more so where the individual seeks\n\nemployment, service, subsidy or benefits;\n\nxxvi. The Central government has the power to direct the linking of Aadhaar\n\ncard, with SIM card, as it is proportional to the object sought to be\n\nachieved in the interest of national security;\nPART C\n\nxxvii. Regarding the process of authentication and metadata retained under\n\nthe Act, it is submitted:\n\na. The only purpose of the Aadhaar project is authentication and there is\n\nno power under the Act to analyze data;\n\nb. The Aadhaar Act does not involve big data or learning algorithms. It\n\nmerely utilizes a matching algorithm for the purpose of authentication;\n\nc. Metadata contemplated is process or technical metadata and does not\n\nreveal anything about the individual.\nSection 2(d)\nof the Act defines\n\n“authentication record” to mean the record of the time of\n\nauthentication, identity of the RE and the response provided by the\n\nAuthority”, and the relevant authentication regulation,\nRegulation 26\n,\n\ndoes not go beyond the scope of\nSection 2(d)\nof the Act;\n\nd. Moreover,\nRegulation 26\nand\nSection 32(3)\nof the Act prohibit the\n\nAuthority from collecting or storing any information about the purpose\n\nof authentication; and\n\ne. Only limited technical metadata is required to be stored in an effort to\n\nexercise control over REs by way of audits.\n\nxxviii. Regarding the security of the Aadhaar data, it is submitted:\n\na. The provisions of the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000\nand the\n\npunitive measures provided there are made applicable to Aadhaar\n\ndata under Section 30 of the Aadhaar Act; and\nPART C\n\nb. Anyone attempting to gain unauthorized access to the CIDR faces\n\nstringent punishment, including imprisonment upto 10 years.\n\nxxix. On the control exercised by the Authority over the Requesting Entities\n\n(RE), the following was urged before the Court:\n\na. The standard of control exercised by the Authority on the Requesting\n\nEntities is ‘fair and reasonable’ as laid down under\nArticle 21\nof the\n\nConstitution;\n\nb. This control includes requirements that the RE’s procure the\n\nfingerprint device from vendors controlled by the Authority, with the\n\nAuthority also providing the hardware and software of the device. The\n\ndevice is subject to quality checks, and must be certified by the\n\nAuthority before being used by the RE. The Authority also takes\n\nmeasures to ensure that data is sent to it in an encrypted form;\n\nc. The license is given to the RE from the Authority only after an audit of\n\nthe RE is conducted, and the audit report is approved; and\n\nd. The data collected by these REs is segregated and there exists no\n\nway of aggregating this data. During authentication requests, the full\n\nidentity information of the individual will never be transmitted back to\n\nthe REs by the Authority as there exists a statutory bar from sharing\n\nBiometric information under\nSections 29 (1) (a)\nand\n29(4)\nof the Act.\nPART C\n\nxxx. UIDAI has entered into licensing agreements with foreign biometric\n\nsolution providers (BSP) for software. Even though the source code of the\n\nsoftware is retained by the BSP as it constitutes their intellectual property,\n\nthe data in the server rooms is secure as the software operates\n\nautomatically and the biometric data is stored offline. There is no\n\nopportunity available to the BSP to extract data as they have no access\n\nto it;\n\nxxxi. Prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, the Aadhaar project was\n\ngoverned by the provisions of the\nInformation Technology Act, 2000\n.\n\nSection 72A\nof the Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for\n\npunishment for disclosure of information in breach of law or contract;\n\nxxxii. The architecture of the Aadhaar Act does not enable any real possibility,\n\nproximate or remote, of mass surveillance in real time by the State;\n\nxxxiii. The giving of identity information and undergoing authentication has no\n\ndirect and inevitable effect on\nArticle 19(1)(a).\nAlternatively, even if\nArticle\n\n19(1)(a)\nis attracted,\nArticle 19(2)\nwould protect Section 7 of the Aadhaar\n\nAct as it has a direct and proximate nexus to public order and security of\n\nthe State;\n\nxxxiv. In response to the argument that the requirements of Aadhaar number\n\nand authentication for benefits, services and subsidies would be ultra\nPART C\n\nvires\nArticle 243-G\nand items 11, 12, 16, 17, 23, 25 and 28 of the XIth\n\nSchedule, it is submitted that the Panchayats get only such powers as\n\nare given to it by the legislature of the State.\nArticle 243-G\nis merely\n\nenabling. There is no compulsion upon the State to endow the\n\nPanchayats with powers relating to the items specified in the XIth\n\nSchedule;\n\nxxxv. On the validity and purpose of\nSection 57\n, it is urged:\n\na.\nSection 57\nis not an enabling provision. It merely provides, as it states,\n\nthat the provisions of the Act would not prevent the use of Aadhaar for\n\nother purposes;\n\nb. However,\nSection 57\nimposes a limitation on any such use for other\n\npurposes, that the use must be sanctioned by any law in force or any\n\ncontract;\n\nc. Another limitation is presented by the proviso to\nSection 57\n, which\n\nsays that the use of the Aadhaar number shall be subject to the\n\nprocedure and obligations under\nSection 8\nand Chapter VI, which\n\nwould necessarily also subject it to the operation of Chapter VII\n\n(dealing with Offences & Penalties) of the Act;\n\nd. Under\nSection 57\n, the State, a body corporate or any other person\n\ncannot become Requesting Entities unless the limitations provided for\n\nunder\nSection 57\nare complied with;\nPART C\n\ne.\nSection 57\nimposes limitations, and the use is backed by\n\nauthentication, protection of information and punitive measures;\n\nf. The expressions ‘pursuant to any law or any contract’, and ‘to this\n\neffect’- necessarily entail that where the State makes a law or any\n\nbody corporate enters into a contract, the law or contract should be\n\nprior in point of time to the making of any application for becoming a\n\nRequesting Entity or a Sub-Authentication User Agency under\n\nRegulation 12\nof the Authentication Regulations; and\n\ng. A large number of small service providers simply cannot become\n\nRequesting Entities under\nSection 57\n, as they will not meet the\n\nrigorous standard demanded by the eligibility conditions which are\n\nprescribed by the Regulations to become Authentication User\n\nAgencies (AUA)/ KYC User Agencies (KUA). Therefore, this provision\n\ndoes not create a situation whereby the common man is required to\n\nundergo authentication in all activities.\n\nxxxvi. The Aadhaar Act is not exclusionary but inclusionary since it provides\n\nall citizens the bare necessities for a dignified existence;\n\nxxxvii. Having the option to opt-out is not a constitutional requirement.\n\nMr Neeraj Kishan Kaul, learned Senior Counsel, made the following\n\nsubmissions:\nPART C\n\ni. Aadhaar is a speedy and reliable tool for identification and authentication\n\nand there is no reason to hold it invalid;\n\nii. Private entities and AUAs/KUAs that have built their businesses around it\n\nshould be allowed to use Aadhaar authentication services;\n\niii.\nSection 57\nis an enabling provision and private players should be given\n\nthe choice to use the Aadhaar authentication services as a tool for\n\nverification if there is a consensus between private players’ and their\n\ncustomers;\n\niv. Aadhaar authentication has benefited women in villages and migrants and\n\nincreased the reach of microfinance institutions, thus reducing predatory\n\nfinancing; and\n\nv. A statute cannot be struck down on the ground that there is scope for\n\nmisuse.\n\nMr Jayant Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Reserve Bank\n\nof India urged the following submissions before the Court:\n\ni. RBI, in exercise of its powers under the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n\nand Rule 9 of the PMLA Rules, 2005 issued an amended Master Circular\n\non April 20, 2018 which mandates that Aadhaar has to be submitted to a\n\nReporting Entity. This circular conforms with the PMLA rules;\nPART C\n\nii. Rule 9(14) of the PMLA Rules provides that the Regulator- the RBI in this\n\ncase, lay down guidelines incorporating the requirements of sub-rules\n\n9(1)-(13), which would include enhanced or simplified measures to verify\n\nidentity; and\n\niii. The requirement of submission of Aadhaar to the RE is in exercise of this\n\npower under Rule 9(14).\n\nMr Gopal Sankarnarayanan, learned counsel, has submitted:\n\ni. The Aadhaar Act as a whole does not violate the fundamental right to\n\nprivacy;\n\nii. The factors that save the Aadhaar Act from failing the proportionality test\n\nare (a) Voluntariness to subject one ’s identity information to obtain\n\nthe Aadhaar ; (b) Informed consent when such identity information is\n\nutilized; and (c) A draw on the Consolidated Fund of India;\n\niii. Right to identity is a fundamental right as a part of the right to dignity,\n\nwhich is being realized by the Aadhaar Act;\n\niv. The right to identity is also recognized under India’s international\n\nobligations under instruments such as the UDHR and ICCPR;\n\nv. In view of the large scale enrolments that have already taken place and\n\nthe expenditure incurred by the Government out of public funds, it would\nPART C\n\nbe in overarching public interest to give\nSection 59\nfull effect. If this were\n\nnot done, the only avenue available to the Government would be to\n\nundertake the mammoth enrolment task all over again under a new\n\nregime, affording only a pyrrhic victory to the Petitioners, while there\n\nwould be substantial revenue losses to the Government and\n\ndeprivation of beneficial schemes to those eligible, in the meanwhile;\n\nvi. Certain provisions of the Aadhaar Act have to be struck down or read\n\ndown so that the Act as a whole can continue to serve its essential\n\npurpose - namely\nSections 47\n,\nSection 8(4)\nand\nSection 29(2)\nof the Act;\n\nand\n\nvii.\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act, 1961 violates\nArticle 14\nand\nof\n\nthe Constitution.\n\nMr Zoheb Hossain, learned Counsel, made the following submissions:\n\ni. The right to privacy cannot be asserted vicariously on behalf of others in\n\na representative capacity in a Public Interest Litigation, because unlike\n\nother constitutional rights, right to privacy is a personal right. No\nSection 7\n\nbeneficiary has claimed a violation of their right to privacy despite the\n\npendency of the petitions for 6 years before this Court and therefore, the\n\nPetitioners' challenge, in a representative capacity, to\nsection 7\non the\nPART C\n\nground of a violation of the right to privacy of third parties is not\n\nmaintainable;\n\nii. There is no increased threat to privacy due to Aadhaar at the level of\n\nrequesting entities (RE) for the following reasons:\n\na. REs are already in possession of personal information of individuals\n\nand inclusion of Aadhaar does not in any manner increase the threat\n\nto privacy;\n\nb. Any information disclosed by REs will not be on account of Aadhaar\n\nand will have to be dealt with under domain specific legislations, or a\n\ndata protection regime or agreements between the REs and their\n\ncustomers; and\n\nc. REs have data of their own customers and not of other REs’\n\ncustomers, so there is no possibility of surveillance.\n\niii. Safeguards against disclosure of information in the Aadhaar Act are\n\nsuperior to the safeguards\nlaid down in\nthe PUCL case51.\nSections 8\n,\nand\nalong with Chapter VII which deals with Offences and Penalties,\n\nprovide for protection of information and\nSection 33\nlays down a strict\n\nprocedure for disclosure. Even though the Aadhaar Act is not required to\n\nmeet the same standard as\nlaid down in\nPUCL, the safeguards in the Act\n\nare not only adequate with regard to identity information and\n\nauthentication records, but far exceed the safeguards laid down PUCL;\n\n51 (2011) 14 SCC 331\nPART C\n\niv. The petitioners cannot contend that Section 33(2) of the Aadhaar Act\n\ngoes against the principles of natural justice and is disproportionate (as it\n\ndoes not define the term “national security”) for the following reasons:\n\na. What is in the interest of “national security” is not a question of law but\n\nthat of policy lying in the executive domain; and\n\nb. Principles of natural justice cannot be observed strictly in a situation\n\nimplicating national security. In such cases, it is the duty of the court to\n\nread into and provide for statutory exclusion.\n\nv. The laws, which are under challenge, are a part of a concerted scheme to\n\npromote redistributive justice and ensure substantive equality, in\n\nfurtherance of\nArticles 14\n, 38\n, 39B and 39C. These laws ensure a more\n\ntransparent and a cleaner system, root out revenue leakages and evasion\n\nof taxes, thereby giving genuine beneficiaries their rightful share in\n\nsubsidies;\n\nvi. The object of the Aadhaar Act, contrary to what the petitioners have\n\nargued, is totally unrelated to suppression of freedom of speech and any\n\nincidental effect, if at all, would not implicate the right under\nArticle\n\n19(1)(a);\n\nvii. The petitioners cannot contend that Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act is\n\narbitrary or unreasonable for the following reasons:\nPART C\n\na. The offences and penalties under the Act are intended to maintain the\n\npurity of data of the Aadhaar number holder and the integrity of the\n\nCIDR, which are integral in achieving the object of the Act;\n\nb. Enrolment, storage of data in CIDR, and authentications are so vast\n\nand inherently technical that any breach of the provisions, can be\n\neffectively dealt with by the UIDAI;\n\nc. The individual has not been left remediless, as he/she can make a\n\ncomplaint to the UIDAI directly or through the grievance redressal\n\ncentre [\nRegulation 32\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update)\n\nRegulations, 2016]. After a complaint has been made, the UIDAI\n\nwould be obliged to examine the complaint and accordingly lodge a\n\ncomplaint in a Court in terms of Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act;\n\nd. Section 56 of the Aadhaar Act makes it clear that application of other\n\nlaws, like the\nIT Act\n, is not barred.\n\nviii. Aadhaar must be made mandatory under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act for\n\nthe following reasons:\n\na. Because of the involvement of biometrics, it is almost impossible for\n\none person to obtain two Aadhaar numbers. This will help in checking\n\nthe entry of fake and duplicate beneficiaries into any welfare scheme;\n\nb. Other methods which were employed over the last 70 years to check\n\nduplication, siphoning of money in welfare schemes, large-scale tax\n\nevasion, generation of black money, and appearance and re-\nPART C\n\nappearance of duplicates, have turned out to be futile. If Aadhaar is\n\nmade voluntary, the same problems are likely to creep back into the\n\nsystem; and\n\nc. The State is bound to deploy the best technology available to it to\n\nensure proper allocation of resources as there is a constitutional\n\nmandate upon the State under\nArticle 14\nto efficiently utilize its\n\nresources.\n\nix. There is no conflict between the Aadhaar Act and the Income Tax Act as\n\nthey are both stand alone laws and their scope of operation is different;\n\nx. Through the Aadhaar Act, the State is furthering the following obligations\n\nunder Part III and Part IV of the Constitution and international obligations:\n\na. The State has a positive obligation for securing socio-economic rights\n\nlike the basic right to food, shelter and livelihood of people arising out\n\nof\nArticle 21\n, even though it is worded negatively;\n\nb. The Supreme Court has observed that civil & political rights and socio-\n\neconomic rights in India are placed on the same pedestal [PUCL].\n\nAadhaar is a means of achieving the latter set of rights. The\n\nproportionality analysis would therefore require a balancing of rights in\n\nthis context;\nPART C\n\nc.\nArticles 38\n, 39(b)\n, (c), (e), (f)\n, 41\n, 43\n, 47\nand\n51(c)\nimpose a\n\nconstitutional mandate on the State to ensure effective and efficient\n\nutilization of public resources;\n\nd. The State is the trustee of public resources towards people, and\n\ninaction of the State to plug the continuous leakage of public\n\nresources and revenues would violate both, the principle of non-\n\narbitrariness and reasonableness envisaged by\nArticle 14\nas well as\n\nthe constitutional doctrine of public trust; and\n\ne. The creation of Aadhaar infrastructure and enactment of the Aadhaar\n\nAct is a step towards the government pursuing India’s international\n\nobligations under the ICESCR.\n\nxi. While testing proportionality, reasonableness of a restriction has to be\n\ndetermined in an objective manner from the standpoint of the interests of\n\nthe general public and not from the perspective of an individual right\n\nbearer claiming invasion52; and\n\nxii. With regard to the alleged conflict between Section 29(2) of the Aadhaar\n\nAct and\nSection 4(b)(xii)\nof the RTI Act, the former cannot be struck down\n\nas unconstitutional for the following reasons:\nModern Dental College and Research Centre v State of Madhya Pradesh\n, (2016) 7 SCC 353.\nPART D\n\na. A provision can be struck down only if it is in violation of the\n\nConstitution or if the legislature lacks competence, not on the ground\n\nthat it is in conflict with another law;\n\nb. In any case, the obligations of public authorities under both these\n\nprovisions are different, as the public authority under the\nRTI Act\ncan\n\npublish the details of beneficiaries from the existing database and the\n\ninformation received by the UIDAI is not required to be shared or\n\ndisplayed publicly. However, if any information is displayed publicly, it\n\ncan be challenged by an aggrieved person on the ground of privacy\n\nwhich would be completely unrelated to the present challenge;\n\nc. The two laws operate in their distinct fields and there is no conflict\n\nbetween them; and\n\nd. A conflict between two statutes is required to be reconciled through\n\nharmonious construction. However, since there is no conflict between\n\nthese two laws, there is no need for harmonious construction.\n\nD Architecture of Aadhaar: analysis of the legal framework\n\n39 The architecture of the Aadhaar Act envisages the creation of a unique\n\nidentity for residents on the basis of demographic and biometric information.\n\nThe Act\nenvisages a process of identification by which the unique identity\nPART D\n\nassigned to each individual is verified with the demographic and biometric\n\ninformation pertaining to that individual which is stored in a centralised\n\nrepository of data known as the Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR). The\n\nformer part of the legislative design is implemented by its regulatory provisions\n\ngoverning enrolment53 of individuals who would be allotted a unique identity\n\nnumber. The latter part of the legislative design consists of the process of\n\n‘authentication’.\n\n40 In order to facilitate an understanding of the key aspects of the law,\n\nSection 2\nprovides a dictionary of meanings. ‘Aadhaar number’ is defined in\n\nSection 2(a)\nas the identification number issued to the individual under sub-\n\nsection (3) of\nSection 3\n. The individual to whom an Aadhaar number is issued\n\nis described in\nSection 2(b)\nas the ‘Aadhaar number holder’. The expression\n\n‘authentication’ is defined in\nSection 2(c)\nthus:\n\n“(c) “Authentication” means the process by which the\nAadhaar number alongwith demographic information or\nbiometric information of an individual is submitted to the\nCentral Identities Data Repository for its verification and such\nRepository verifies the correctness or lack thereof, on basis of\ninformation available with it.”\n\nSection 2(d)\nspeaks of the ‘authentication record’ as the record of the time of\n\nauthentication, the identity of the requesting entity and the response provided\n\nby UIDAI. The crucial definitions are those of ‘biometric information’, ‘core\nSection 2(m)\nstates: “enrolment” means the process, as may be specified by regulations, to collect\ndemographic and biometric information from individuals by the enrolling agencies for the purpose of issuing\nAadhaar numbers to such individuals under this Act.\nPART D\n\nbiometric information’, ‘demographic information’ and ‘identity information’.\n\nThese are as follows:\n\n“(g) “biometric information” means photograph, finger print,\nIris scan, or other such biological attributes of an individual as\nmay be specified by regulations;\n\n...\n\n(j) “core biometric information” means finger print, Iris scan, or\nsuch other biological attribute of an individual as may be\nspecified by regulations;\n\n(k) “demographic information” includes information relating to\nthe name, date of birth, address and other relevant\ninformation of an individual, as may be specified by\nregulations for the purpose of issuing an Aadhaar number,\nbut shall not include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity,\nlanguage, records of entitlement, income or medical history.\n\n...\n\n(n) “identity information” in respect of an individual, includes\nhis Aadhaar number, his biometric information and his\ndemographic information.”\n\nThe largest subset of the above definitions consists of ‘identity information’\n\nwhich is defined in an inclusive sense to comprehend the Aadhaar number,\n\nbiometric information and demographic information. Demographic information\n\nis defined as information related to the name, date of birth and address and\n\nother information pertaining to an individual as is specified by the regulations.\n\nSignificantly,\nSection 2(k)\nexcludes, by a mandate, race, religion, caste, tribe,\n\nethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history from the\n\npurview of demographic information. Biometric information consists, under\n\nSection 2(g)\n, of the photograph, fingerprint, Iris scan, or other such biological\n\nattributes of an individual as may be specified by regulations. Core biometric\n\ninformation in\nSection 2(j)\nexcludes photographs (which form part of biometric\nPART D\n\ninformation). Apart from photographs, other biometric information is\n\ncomprehended within core biometric information and may be expanded to\n\ninclude other biological attributes specified in the regulations to be made\n\nunder the Act.\n\n41 The identity information of an individual is stored in a central depository.\n\nSection 2(h)\ndefines “Central Identities Data Repository” as a centralised\n\ndatabase in one or more locations containing all Aadhaar numbers issued to\n\nAadhaar number holders along with the corresponding demographic\n\ninformation and biometric information of such individuals and other related\n\ninformation. The CIDR is the backbone of the Aadhaar Act. All the information\n\ncollected or created under the Act is stored in it. For the establishment and\n\nmaintenance of the CIDR, it has been provided54 under the Act that UIDAI may\n\nengage one or more entities, which can also perform any other functions as\n\nmay be specified by regulations.\nThe Act\ndoes not prohibit the engagement of\n\nprivate entities for the establishment and maintenance of the CIDR.\nSection 3\n, pertains to the entitlement to obtain an ‘Aadhaar Number’,\n\nwhich forms a part of Chapter II titled ‘enrolment’.\nSection 3\ncomprises of\n\nthree parts: (i) an entitlement of every resident to obtain an Aadhaar number;\n\n(ii) a requirement of submitting demographic and biometric information to be\n\nenrolled; and (iii) a process of undergoing enrolment.\nSection 3\nprovides thus:\n\n54 Section 10, Aadhaar Act\nPART D\n\n“Section (3): Aadhaar Number.-\n\n(1) Every resident shall be entitled to obtain an Aadhaar\nnumber by submitting his demographic information\nand biometric information by undergoing the process\nof enrolment:\n\nProvided that the Central Government may, from time\nto time, notify such other category of individuals who\nmay be entitled to obtain an Aadhaar number.\n\n(2) The enrolling agency shall, at the time of enrolment,\ninform the individual undergoing enrolment of the\nfollowing details in such manner as maybe specified\nby regulations, namely:-\n\n(a) The manner in which the information shall be\nused;\n\n(b) The nature of recipients with whom the information\nis intended to be shared during authentication; and\n\n(c) The existence of a right to access information, the\nprocedure for making requests for such access\nand details of the person or department in-charge\nto whom such requests can be made.\n\n(3) On receipt of the demographic information and\nbiometric information under sub-section (1), the\nAuthority shall, after verifying the information, in such\nmanner as may be specified by regulations, issue an\nAadhaar number to such individual.”\n\nSignificantly, sub-section (1) of\nSection 3\nrecognises an entitlement, of every\n\nresident55 to obtain an Aadhaar number. An entitlement postulates a right. A\n\nright contemplates a liberty, for it is in the exercise of the liberty that the\n\nindividual asserts a right. What is a matter of an entitlement is evidently a\n\nmatter of option and not a compulsion. That constitutes the fundamental\n\npostulate of\nSection 3\n. However, the entitlement to obtain the Aadhaar\nSection 2(v)\nstates: “resident” means an individual who has resided in India for a period or periods amounting\nin all to one hundred and eighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of\napplication for enrolment\nPART D\n\nnumber is conditioned by the requirement of submitting demographic and\n\nbiometric information and participating in the process of enrolment.\n\n43 The collection of demographic and biometric information is carried out\n\nby an enrolling agency. “Enrolling agency” has been defined under\nSection\n\n2(l)\nof the Act as an agency, appointed by UIDAI or a Registrar56, for collecting\n\ndemographic and biometric information of individuals under the Act. The\n\nenrolling agency need not be an entity of the state. The definition opens the\n\nspace for engagement of private entities in the collection of individual\n\ninformation for the process of enrolment. The enrolling agencies have to set\n\nup enrolment centers and they have to function in accordance with the\n\nprocedure specified by UIDAI.57 Sub-section (2) of\nSection 3\nrequires the\n\nenrolling agency to disclose to the individual, who is undergoing enrolment,\n\nthree important facets. The first is the manner in which the information which\n\nis disclosed by the individual would be used. The second relates to the nature\n\nof the recipients with whom the information is likely to be shared during the\n\ncourse of authentication. The third is founded upon the individual’s right of\n\naccess to the information disclosed. All these three facets are crucial to the\n\nlegislative design because they try to place individual autonomy at the\n\nforefront of the process. An individual who discloses biometric and\n\ndemographic information has a statutory entitlement to fully understand how\n\nthe information which is disclosed is going to be used and with whom the\nSection 2(s)\nstates: “Registrar” means any entity authorised or recognised by the Authority for the purpose of\nenrolling individuals under this Act\nRegulation 7\n, Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016\nPART D\n\ninformation is likely to be shared during authentication.58 Access of the\n\ninformation supplied to the individual, it has been argued, is an integral feature\n\nof the design created by the statute. These three facets are conditions\n\nprecedent to the disclosure of information by the individual. Before the\n\nindividual does so, he or she must have a full disclosure which would enable\n\nthem to form an informed decision on the exercise of the choice which\n\nunderlies an entitlement to an Aadhaar number. The entitlement which is\n\nrecognised by sub-section (1) is enforced by the mandatory requirements of\n\nsub-section (2). Before an Aadhaar number is issued, sub-section (3)\n\nrequires the authority to verify the information disclosed, in the manner\n\nprescribed by regulations.\nThe Act\nleaves it to regulations to specify how\n\nverification will be carried out.\nSections 4\n,\nand\nindicate the characteristics which are attributed to\n\nAadhaar numbers, legislative recognition of the steps necessary to ensure\n\nfinancial inclusion and the requirement of periodical updation of information.\n\nUnder\nSection 4\n, three important features attach to the possession of an\n\nAadhaar number. The first is that the number is unique to one individual and\n\nto that individual alone. Once assigned, the Aadhaar number cannot be\n\nreassigned to any other individual. The second feature is that an Aadhaar\n\nnumber is random and bears no relation to the attributes or identity of its\n\nholder. The third feature of\nSection 4\nis that once assigned, an Aadhaar\n\nnumber can be accepted as proof of identify of its holder “for any purpose”.\n58 Section 3(2), Aadhaar Act.\nPART D\n\nUnder\nSection 5\n, UIDAI is under a mandate to adopt special measures to\n\nissue Aadhaar numbers to women, children, senior citizens, the differently\n\nabled, unskilled and unorganised workers, nomadic tribes, persons who do\n\nnot have permanent places of abode and to other categories which may be\n\ndefined by the regulations.\nSection 6\ncontains an enabling provision by which\n\nthe authority may require holders to update their demographic and biometric\n\ninformation periodically, as specified under regulations. An Aadhaar number\n\nalso does not, by itself, constitute a conferment of a right of citizenship, or\n\ndomicile (\nSection 9\n).\n\n45 Chapter III provides for Authentication. By virtue of\nSection 7\n, an\n\nenabling provision has been made by which the Union or state governments\n\nmay require proof of an Aadhaar number for receiving subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices for which the expenditure is incurred from (or the receipts form part\n\nof) the Consolidated Fund of India.\nSection 7\nis in the following terms:\n\n“7. Proof of Aadhaar number necessary for receipt of certain\nsubsidies, benefits and services, etc.- The Central\nGovernment or, as the case may be, the State Government\nmay, for the purpose of establishing identity of an individual\nas a condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service for\nwhich the expenditure is incurred from, or the receipt\ntherefrom forms part of, the Consolidated Fund of India,\nrequire that such individual undergo authentication, or furnish\nproof of possession of Aadhaar number or in the case of an\nindividual to whom no Aadhaar number has been assigned,\nsuch individual makes an application for enrolment:\n\nProvided that if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to an\nindividual, the individual shall be offered alternate and viable\nmeans of identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or\nservice.”\nPART D\n\nSection 3\n(as explained earlier) postulates an entitlement to an Aadhaar\n\nnumber. An entitlement envisages a right which may (or may not) be\n\nexercised by the resident. An entitlement is, after all, an option.\nSection 7\n,\n\nhowever, contemplates a requirement. It covers subsidies, benefits or\n\nservices that are charged to the Consolidated Fund of India; the connect being\n\neither in regard to the source of expenditure or the receipts. The statutory\n\ndefinitions of the expressions ‘benefit’, ‘service’ and ‘subsidy’ are contained in\n\nclauses (f),(w) and (x) of\nSection 2\nwhich provide as follows:\n\n“(f) “benefit” means any advantage, gift, reward, relief, or\npayment, in cash or kind, provided to an individual or a group\nof individuals and includes such other benefits as may be\nnotified by the Central Government;”\n\n(w) “service” means any provision, facility, utility or any other\nassistance provided in any form to an individual or a group of\nindividuals and includes such other services as may be\nnotified by the Central Government;\n\n(x) “subsidy” means any form of aid, support, grant,\nsubvention, or appropriation, in cash or kind, to an individual\nor a group of individuals and includes such other subsidies as\nmay be notified by the Central Government.”\nSection 7\nencapsulates a purpose, a condition and a requirement. The\n\npurpose incorporated in the provision is to establish the identity of an\n\nindividual. The condition which it embodies is for the receipt of a subsidy,\n\nbenefit or service for which the expenditure is incurred or the receipts form\n\npart of the Consolidated Fund of India. Where the purpose and condition are\n\nfulfilled, the central or state governments may require that the individual\n\nshould (i) undergo authentication; or (ii) furnish proof of possession of an\n\nAadhaar number; or (iii) provide proof of an application for enrolment where\nPART D\n\nthe Aadhaar number has not been assigned. Three alternatives are stipulated\n\nin\nSection 7\n. Where the purpose and condition (noted above) are fulfilled, the\n\nindividual has to undergo authentication. Alternately, the individual has to\n\nfurnish proof that he or she possesses an Aadhaar number. However, if an\n\nAadhaar number has not been assigned to the individual, he or she would\n\nhave to make an application for enrolment. In a situation where no Aadhaar\n\nnumber has been assigned as yet, the proviso stipulates that alternate and\n\nviable means of identification would be provided to the individual for the\n\ndelivery of subsidies, benefits or services.\nSection 7\nindicates that while the\n\ncentral or state governments can mandate that an individual must undergo\n\nauthentication as a condition for the receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service, a\n\nfailure of authentication cannot be held out as a ground to deny benefits,\n\nsubsidies or services. That is for the reason that in the absence of\n\nauthentication, possession of an Aadhaar number would suffice. Moreover,\n\neven if an individual does not possess an Aadhaar number, the mandate of\n\nSection 7\nwould be subserved by producing an application for enrolment.\n\nSection 3\nwhich speaks of an entitlement to obtain an Aadhaar number stands\n\nin contrast to\nSection 7\nunder which an Aadhaar number may be required as a\n\ncondition for the receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service. As an entitlement,\n\nSection 3\nmakes the possession of an Aadhaar number optional.\nSection 7\nis\n\nan enabling power by which the central or state governments may make the\n\nrequirement of an Aadhaar number compulsive or mandatory where a person\nPART D\n\ndesires a subsidy, benefit or service for which expenditure is incurred from or\n\nthe receipt of which forms part of the Consolidated Fund of India.\nSection 7\n\nacts as an overriding provision over\nSection 3\n.\n\n47 The manner in which an authentication is carried out is elaborated upon\n\nby\nSection 8\n.\nSection 8\nis in the following terms:\n\n“Authentication of Aadhaar number.-\n\n(1) The Authority shall perform authentication of the\nAadhaar number of an Aadhaar number holder submitted by\nany requesting entity, in relation to his biometric information\nor demographic information, subject to such conditions and\non payment of such fees and in such manner as may be\nspecified by regulations.\n\n(2) A requesting entity shall –\n\n(a) unless otherwise provided in this Act, obtain\nthe consent of an individual before collecting his identity\ninformation for the purposes of authentication in such\nmanner as may be specified by regulations; and\n\n(b) ensure that the identity information of an\nindividual is only used for submission to the Central\nIdentities Data Repository for authentication.\n\n(3) A requesting entity shall inform, in such manner as\nmay be specified by regulations, the individual submitting his\nidentify information for authentication, the following details\nwith respect to authentication, namely:-\n\n(a) the nature of information that may be shared\nupon authentication;\n\n(b) the uses to which the information received\nduring authentication may be put by the requesting\nentity; and\n\n(c) alternatives to submission of identity\ninformation to the requesting entity.\n\n(4) The Authority shall respond to an authentication query\nwith a positive, negative or any other appropriate response\nsharing such identity information excluding any core biometric\ninformation.”\n\nAs we have noticed earlier, authentication involves a process in which the\n\nAadhaar number, together with the demographic or biometric information, is\nPART D\n\nsubmitted to the CIDR for verification and is verified to be correct or otherwise\n\nby the repository on the basis of the information available with it. Under sub-\n\nsection (1) of\nSection 8\nauthentication has to be performed on a request\n\nsubmitted by a requesting entity. The expression ‘requesting entity’ is defined\n\nin\nSection 2(u)\nas follows:\n\n“(u) “requesting entity” means an agency or person that\nsubmits the Aadhaar number, and demographic information\nor biometric information, of an individual to the Central\nIdentities Data Repository for authentication.”\n\nThis definition also does not prohibit the engagement of private agencies for\n\nthe process of authentication. Under sub-section (2) of\nSection 8\n, every\n\nrequesting entity is bound to obtain the consent of the individual before\n\ncollecting his or her identity information for the purpose of authentication.\n\nMoreover, the requesting entity must ensure that the identity information is\n\nsubmitted only for the purpose of authentication to the CIDR. Before the\n\nrequesting entity submits the identity information for authentication, it is under\n\na mandate of law to disclose (i) the nature of the information that may be\n\nshared upon authentication; (ii) the use to which information received during\n\nauthentication may be put; and (iii) alternatives to the submission of identity\n\ninformation.59 During the course of authentication, UIDAI is required to\n\nrespond to an authentication query with a positive, negative or appropriate\n\nresponse sharing such identity information excluding core biometric\n\ninformation.60 Core biometric information cannot be shared. The modes of\n\n59 Section 8(3), Aadhaar Act\n60 Section 8(4), Aadhaar Act\nPART D\n\nauthentication are as mentioned in\nRegulation 4\nof the Aadhaar\n\n(Authentication) Regulations 2016. It can be based on (i) demographic\n\ninformation; (ii) a one-time password with limited time validity; (iii) biometrics\n\nor (iv) multi-factor authentication (a combination of two or more of the above).\n\nThe Requesting Agency chooses the mode according to its requirement.\n\n48 UIDAI is the umbrella entity under the Aadhaar Act. The statutory\n\nbacking to the authority of UIDAI to undertake the responsibility for the\n\nprocesses of enrolment and authentication and maintenance of CIDR has\n\nbeen provided under\nChapter IV of the Act\n.\nSection 11\nprovides that the\n\nCentral Government shall, by notification, establish UIDAI, a body corporate 61,\n\nto be responsible for the processes of enrolment and authentication and\n\nperform such other functions as are assigned to it under the Act. The\n\ncomposition of UIDAI has been provided under\nSection 12\n: a Chairperson\n\n(appointed on part-time or full-time basis); two part-time Members, and the\n\nchief executive officer who shall be the Member- Secretary, to be appointed\n\nby the Central Government.\nSection 23\nenunciates the powers and functions\n\nof the UIDAI. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 23\nrequires UIDAI to develop the\n\npolicy, procedure and systems for issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals and\n\nto perform authentication.\nSection 23(2)\nprovides an inclusive list of the\n\npowers and functions of UIDAI:\n\n“(2) Without prejudice to sub-section (1), the powers and\nfunctions of the Authority, inter alia, include—\n\n61 Section 11(2), Aadhaar Act\nPART D\n\n(a) specifying, by regulations, demographic information and\nbiometric information required for enrolment and the\nprocesses for collection and verification thereof;\n\n(b) collecting demographic information and biometric\ninformation from any individual seeking an Aadhaar number\nin such manner as may be specified by regulations;\n\n(c) appointing of one or more entities to operate the Central\nIdentities Data Repository;\n\n(d) generating and assigning Aadhaar numbers to individuals;\n\n(e) performing authentication of Aadhaar numbers;\n\n(f) maintaining and updating the information of individuals in\nthe Central Identities Data Repository in such manner as may\nbe specified by regulations;\n\n(g) omitting and deactivating of an Aadhaar number and\ninformation relating thereto in such manner as may be\nspecified by regulations;\n\n(h) specifying the manner of use of Aadhaar numbers for the\npurposes of providing or availing of various subsidies,\nbenefits, services and other purposes for which Aadhaar\nnumbers may be used;\n\n(i) specifying, by regulations, the terms and conditions for\nappointment of Registrars, enrolling agencies and service\nproviders and revocation of appointments thereof;\n\n(j) establishing, operating and maintaining of the Central\nIdentities Data Repository;\n\n(k) sharing, in such manner as may be specified by\nregulations, the information of Aadhaar number holders,\nsubject to the provisions of this Act;\n\n(l) calling for information and records, conducting inspections,\ninquiries and audit of the operations for the purposes of this\nAct of the Central Identities Data Repository, Registrars,\nenrolling agencies and other agencies appointed under this\nAct;\n\n(m) specifying, by regulations, various processes relating to\ndata management, security protocols and other technology\nsafeguards under this Act;\n\n(n) specifying, by regulations, the conditions and procedures\nfor issuance of new Aadhaar number to existing Aadhaar\nnumber holder;\n\n(o) levying and collecting the fees or authorising the\nRegistrars, enrolling agencies or other service providers to\nPART D\n\ncollect such fees for the services provided by them under this\nAct in such manner as may be specified by regulations;\n\n(p) appointing such committees as may be necessary to\nassist the Authority in discharge of its functions for the\npurposes of this Act;\n\n(q) promoting research and development for advancement in\nbiometrics and related areas, including usage of Aadhaar\nnumbers through appropriate mechanisms;\n\n(r) evolving of, and specifying, by regulations, policies and\npractices for Registrars, enrolling agencies and other service\nproviders;\n\n(s) setting up facilitation centres and grievance redressal\nmechanism for redressal of grievances of individuals,\nRegistrars, enrolling agencies and other service providers;\n\n(t) such other powers and functions as may be prescribed.”\n\nUnder\nSection 54\n, UIDAI is empowered to make regulations and rules\n\nconsistent with the Act, for carrying out the provisions of the Act. Sub-section\n\n(2) of\nSection 54\nprovides that UIDAI may make regulations covering any of\n\nthe following matters:\n\n“(a) the biometric information under clause (g) and the\ndemographic information under clause (k), and the process of\ncollecting demographic information and biometric information\nfrom the individuals by enrolling agencies under clause (m) of\n\nsection 2\n;\n\n(b) the manner of verifying the demographic information and\nbiometric information for issue of Aadhaar number under sub-\n\nsection (3) of\nsection 3\n;\n\n(c) the conditions for accepting an Aadhaar number as proof\nof identity of the Aadhaar number holder under sub-section\n(3) of\nsection 4\n;\n\n(d) the other categories of individuals under\nsection 5\nfor\nwhom the Authority shall take special measures for allotment\nof Aadhaar number;\n\n(e) the manner of updating biometric information and\ndemographic information under\nsection 6\n;\n\n(f) the procedure for authentication of the Aadhaar number\nunder\nsection 8\n;\nPART D\n\n(g) the other functions to be performed by the Central\nIdentities Data Repository under\nsection 10\n;\n\n(h) the time and places of meetings of the Authority and the\nprocedure for transaction of business to be followed by it,\nincluding the quorum, under sub-section (1) of\nsection 19\n;\n\n(i) the salary and allowances payable to, and other terms and\nconditions of service of, the chief executive officer, officers\nand other employees of the Authority under sub-section (2) of\n\nsection 21\n;\n\n(j) the demographic information and biometric information\nunder clause (a) and the manner of their collection under\nclause (b) of sub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(k) the manner of maintaining and updating the information of\nindividuals in the Central Identities Data Repository under\nclause (f) of sub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(l) the manner of omitting and deactivating an Aadhaar\nnumber and information relating thereto under clause (g) of\nsub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(m) the manner of use of Aadhaar numbers for the purposes\nof providing or availing of various subsidies, benefits, services\nand other purposes for which Aadhaar numbers may be used\nunder clause (h) of sub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(n) the terms and conditions for appointment of Registrars,\nenrolling agencies and other service providers and the\nrevocation of appointments thereof under clause (i) of sub-\nsection (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(o) the manner of sharing information of Aadhaar number\nholder under clause (k) of sub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(p) various processes relating to data management, security\nprotocol and other technology safeguards under clause (m) of\nsub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(q) the procedure for issuance of new Aadhaar number to\nexisting Aadhaar number holder under clause (n) of sub-\nsection (2) of\nsection 23\n;\n\n(r) manner of authorising Registrars, enrolling agencies or\nother service providers to collect such fees for services\nprovided by them under clause (o) of sub-section (2) of\n\nsection 23\n;\n\n(s) policies and practices to be followed by the Registrar,\nenrolling agencies and other service providers under clause\n\n(r) of sub-section (2) of\nsection 23\n;\nPART D\n\n(t) the manner of accessing the identity information by the\nAadhaar number holder under the proviso to sub-section (5)\nof\nsection 28\n;\n\n(u) the manner of sharing the identity information, other than\ncore biometric information, collected or created under this Act\nunder sub-section (2) of\nsection 29\n;\n\n(v) the manner of alteration of demographic information under\nsub-section (1) and biometric information under sub-section\n(2) of\nsection 31\n;\n\n(w) the manner of and the time for maintaining the request for\nauthentication and the response thereon under sub-section\n(1), and the manner of obtaining, by the Aadhaar number\nholder, the authentication records under sub-section (2) of\n\nsection 32\n;\n\n(x) any other matter which is required to be, or may be,\nspecified, or in respect of which provision is to be or may be\nmade by regulations.”\n\nSection 11(1)\n, read with\nSections 23(2)\nand\n54(2)\n, indicates that UIDAI is the\n\nsole authority vested with the power and responsibility of carrying out\n\nnumerous functions. These functions include:\n\n(i) collection of demographic information and biometric information from\n\nindividuals;\n\n(ii) generating and assigning Aadhaar numbers to individuals;\n\n(iii) performing authentication of Aadhaar numbers;\n\n(iv) maintaining and updating the information of individuals in the CIDR;\n\n(v) omitting and deactivating of an Aadhaar number;\n\n(vi) specifying the manner of use of Aadhaar numbers for the purposes of\n\nproviding or availing of various subsidies, benefits, services and other\n\npurposes;\nPART D\n\n(vii) specifying the terms and conditions for appointment of Registrars,\n\nenrolling agencies and service providers and revocation of appointments;\n\n(viii) specifying various processes relating to data management, security\n\nprotocols and other technological safeguards under the Act;\n\n(ix) setting up facilitation centres and mechanisms for the redressal of the\n\ngrievances of individuals, Registrars, enrolling agencies and other service\n\nproviders; and\n\n(x) other functions prescribed by the Central government.\n\nThe Act\ndoes not set any limits within which the sole authority of UIDAI may\n\noperate. UIDAI has been conferred with discretionary powers as provided in\n\nthe above provisions. The architecture of Aadhaar keeps UIDAI at the centre\n\nof all processes.\n\n49 For the purpose of performing the functions of collecting, storing,\n\nsecuring, processing of information, delivery of Aadhaar numbers to\n\nindividuals or performing authentication, clause (a) of\nSection 23(3)\n\ncontemplates that UIDAI may enter into Memoranda of Understanding or\n\nagreements with the central or state governments, Union territories or other\n\nagencies. In discharging its functions, UIDAI may appoint, by notification, a\n\nnumber of Registrars, engage and authorise such agencies to collect, store,\n\nsecure and process information or perform authentication or such other\n\nfunctions in relation to it, as may be necessary for the purposes of the Act\nPART D\n\n(\nSection 23 (3) (b)\n). For the efficient discharge of its functions, UIDAI may also\n\nengage consultants, advisors and other persons as may be required (\nSection\n\n23(4)\n). These, like many other provisions, open the scope for the involvement\n\nof private entities in the Aadhaar project. This is also evident from\nSection 57\n\nof the Act, which allows the use of the Aadhaar number, by the state,\n\ncorporate entities or persons to establish the identity of an individual:\n\n“57. Act not to prevent use of Aadhaar number for other\npurposes under law.-\n\nNothing contained in this Act shall prevent the use of Aadhaar\nnumber for establishing the identity of an individual for any\npurpose, whether by the State or any body corporate or\nperson, pursuant to any law, for the time being in force, or\nany contract to this effect:\n\nProvided that the use of Aadhaar number under this section\nshall be subject to the procedure and obligations under\n\nsection 8\nand Chapter VI.”\n\n50 The responsibility to ensure the security of identity information and\n\nauthentication records of individuals has been placed on UIDAI. 62 UIDAI is\n\nalso required to ensure confidentiality of identity information and authentication\n\nrecords of individuals,63 except in circumstances, where disclosure of\n\ninformation is permitted by the Act.64\nSection 28(3)\nrequires UIDAI to take all\n\nnecessary measures to ensure that the information in its possession or control,\n\nincluding information stored in the CIDR, is secured and protected against\n\naccess, use or disclosure not permitted under the Act or regulations, and\n\nagainst accidental or intentional destruction, loss or damage. For the purpose\n\n62 Section 28(1), Aadhaar Act\n63 Section 28(2), Aadhaar Act\n64 Section 33, Aadhaar Act\nPART D\n\nof maintaining the security and confidentiality of the information of individuals,\n\nUIDAI is also required, under Section 28(4), to:\n\n“(a) adopt and implement appropriate technical and\norganisational security measures;\n\n(b) ensure that the agencies, consultants, advisors or other\npersons appointed or engaged for performing any function of\nthe Authority under this Act, have in place appropriate\ntechnical and organisational security measures for the\ninformation; and\n\n(c) ensure that the agreements or arrangements entered into\nwith such agencies, consultants, advisors or other persons,\nimpose obligations equivalent to those imposed on the\nAuthority under this Act, and require such agencies,\nconsultants, advisors and other persons to act only on\ninstructions from the Authority.”\n\nExcept where it has otherwise been provided in the Aadhaar Act, a burden is\n\nplaced (under\nSection 28(5)\n) upon UIDAI, its officers, other employees\n\n(whether during service or thereafter), and any agency that maintains the\n\nCIDR not to reveal any information stored or the authentication record to\n\nanyone. An Aadhaar number holder, however, may request UIDAI to provide\n\naccess to identity information excluding core biometric information in the\n\nmanner as may be specified by regulations (proviso to\nSection 28(5)\n).\n\nSection 29\nputs restrictions on sharing of information, collected or created\n\nunder the Act. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 29\nprovides that:\n\n“(1) No core biometric information, collected or created under\nthis Act, shall be—\n\n(a) shared with anyone for any reason whatsoever; or\n\n(b) used for any purpose other than generation of Aadhaar\nnumbers and authentication under this Act.”\nPART D\n\nSub-section (2) contemplates that the identity information, other than core\n\nbiometric information, collected or created under the Act may be shared only in\n\naccordance with the provisions of the Act and in the manner as may be\n\nspecified by regulations.\n\nA burden is placed, under\nSection 29(3)\n, upon a requesting entity to ensure\n\nthat any identity information available with it, is neither used for any purpose,\n\nother than that specified to the individual at the time of submitting identity\n\ninformation for authentication; nor disclosed further, except with the prior\n\nconsent of the individual to whom such information relates.\n\nSub-section (4) prohibits publishing, display or posting publicly of any Aadhaar\n\nnumber or core biometric information collected or created under the Act in\n\nrespect of an Aadhaar number holder, except for such purposes as may be\n\nspecified by the regulations.\nSection 30\ncontemplates that the biometric\n\ninformation collected and stored in an electronic form is to be deemed\n\n“sensitive personal data or information”. The provision specifically relates to\n\nbiometric information. The provision dilutes the protection that should be given\n\nto demographic information. Further, a statutory duty has been placed upon\n\nUIDAI to maintain authentication records in the manner and for a time period\n\nprescribed by regulations.65 The issue of maintenance of authentication\n\nrecords by UIDAI has been contentious and is dealt in a subsequent section\n\ntitled “Proportionality”. A statutory right is provided to every Aadhaar number\n\n65 Section 32(1), Aadhaar Act\nPART D\n\nholder to obtain his authentication record in the manner specified by\n\nregulations.66\nSection 32(3)\nprohibits UIDAI (either by itself or through any\n\nentity under its control) to collect, keep or maintain any information about the\n\npurpose of authentication.\n\n51 The Aadhaar Act allows disclosure of individual information in limited\n\ncircumstances. The manner and purpose for which information of individuals,\n\nincluding identity information or authentication records, can be disclosed has\n\nbeen provided under\nSection 33\nof the Act.\nSection 33\nstates:\n\n“(1) Nothing contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (5) of\n\nsection 28\nor sub-section (2) of\nsection 29\nshall apply in\nrespect of any disclosure of information, including identity\ninformation or authentication records, made pursuant to an\norder of a court not inferior to that of a District Judge:\n\nProvided that no order by the court under this sub-section\nshall be made without giving an opportunity of hearing to the\nAuthority.\n\n(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (2) or sub-section (5) of\n\nsection 28\nand clause (b) of sub-section (1), sub-section (2)\nor sub-section (3) of\nsection 29\nshall apply in respect of any\ndisclosure of information, including identity information or\nauthentication records, made in the interest of national\nsecurity in pursuance of a direction of an officer not below the\nrank of Joint Secretary to the Government of India specially\nauthorised in this behalf by an order of the Central\nGovernment:\n\nProvided that every direction issued under this sub-section,\nshall be reviewed by an Oversight Committee consisting of\nthe Cabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the Government\nof India in the Department of Legal Affairs and the\nDepartment of Electronics and Information Technology,\nbefore it takes effect:\n\nProvided further that any direction issued under this sub-\nsection shall be valid for a period of three months from the\n\n66 Section 32(2), Aadhaar Act\nPART D\n\ndate of its issue, which may be extended for a further period\nof three months after the review by the Oversight Committee.”\n\nThe Aadhaar Act provides two categories: a “court order” and “in the interest of\n\nnational security”, where the personal information of an individual can be\n\ndisclosed.\n\nUnder\nSection 31\n, in case any demographic information or biometric\n\ninformation of an Aadhaar number holder is found to be incorrect, is lost or\n\nchanges subsequently, the Aadhaar number holder is required to request\n\nUIDAI to make an alteration in his or her record in the CIDR in the manner\n\nspecified by regulations. On receipt of a request for alteration of demographic\n\nor biometric information, UIDAI is vested with the power, subject to its\n\nsatisfaction, to make alterations as required in the record relating to the\n\nAadhaar number holder and to intimate the alteration to the holder. Sub-\n\nsection (4) of\nSection 31\nprohibits alteration of any identity information in the\n\nCIDR except in the manner provided in the Act or regulations made in this\n\nbehalf.\n\n52 Chapter VII provides offences and penalties. Under\nSection 34\n, a\n\npenalty has been provided for impersonation at the time of enrolment.\nSection\ncreates a penalty for impersonation of the Aadhaar number holder by\n\nchanging demographic or biometric information.\nSection 37\nprovides a penalty\nPART D\n\nfor disclosing identity information (which was collected in the course of\n\nenrolment or authentication).\n\nUnder\nSection 38\n, a penalty for unauthorised access to the CIDR has been\n\nprovided.\nSection 38\nprovides thus:\n\n“Whoever, not being authorised by the Authority,\nintentionally,—\n\n(a) accesses or secures access to the Central Identities Data\nRepository;\n\n(b) downloads, copies or extracts any data from the Central\nIdentities Data Repository or stored in any removable storage\nmedium;\n\n(c) introduces or causes to be introduced any virus or other\ncomputer contaminant in the Central Identities Data\nRepository;\n\n(d) damages or causes to be damaged the data in the Central\nIdentities Data Repository;\n\n(e) disrupts or causes disruption of the access to the Central\nIdentities Data Repository;\n\n(f) denies or causes a denial of access to any person who is\nauthorised to access the Central Identities Data Repository;\n\n(g) reveals any information in contravention of sub-section (5)\nof\nsection 28\n, or shares, uses or displays information in\ncontravention of\nsection 29\nor assists any person in any of the\naforementioned acts;\n\n(h) destroys, deletes or alters any information stored in any\nremovable storage media or in the Central Identities Data\nRepository or diminishes its value or utility or affects it\ninjuriously by any means; or\n\n(i) steals, conceals, destroys or alters or causes any person\nto steal, conceal, destroy or alter any computer source code\nused by the Authority with an intention to cause damage,\n\nshall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may\nextend to three years and shall also be liable to a fine which\nshall not be less than ten lakh rupees.”\nPART D\n\nSection 39\nimposes a penalty for tampering with data in the CIDR.\nSections 40\n\nand\nimpose penalties on requesting and enrolment agencies in case they\n\nact in contravention of the obligations imposed upon them under the Act.\n\nSection 42\nprovides for a general penalty for an offence under the Act or the\n\nrules or regulations made thereunder, for which no specific penalty is provided\n\nunder the Act. Under\nSection 43\n, when an offence has been committed by a\n\ncompany, every person who at the time the offence was committed was in\n\ncharge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business\n\nof the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the\n\noffence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.\n\nSection 44\nindicates that the provisions of the Act would apply to any offence\n\nor contravention committed outside India by any person, irrespective of\n\nnationality. The power to investigate offences under the Act has been placed,\n\nunder\nSection 45\n, on a police officer not below the rank of Inspector of Police.\n\nSection 47(1)\nof the Act puts a bar on the courts from taking cognizance of any\n\noffence punishable under the Act, except when a complaint is made by UIDAI\n\nor any officer or person authorised by it. The provision indicates that the scope\n\nof cognizance is limited. It does not allow an individual who finds that there is\n\nany violation under the Act, to initiate criminal proceedings. The scope of\n\ngrievance redressal under the Act is restrictive and works only on the action of\n\nUIDAI or a person authorised by it. UIDAI has set up a grievance redressal\n\nmechanism as contemplated by Section 23(2)(s) of the Aadhaar Act. There is\nPART D\n\nno grievance redressal mechanism if any breach or offence is committed by\n\nUIDAI itself. The right of an individual to seek remedy under the Act if his/her\n\nrights are violated will be discussed subsequently. Under sub-Section (2), no\n\ncourt inferior to that of a Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or a Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate can try any offence punishable under the Act.\n\nSection 48\nempowers the Central Government to supersede UIDAI, in certain\n\nsituations. Under\nSection 50\n, UIDAI, in exercise of its powers or performance\n\nof its functions under the Act, shall be bound by the written directions on\n\nquestions of policy of the Central Government.\nSection 51\nvests power in\n\nUIDAI to delegate to any member, officer or any other person, its powers and\n\nfunctions under the Act (except the power under\nsection 54\n) as it may deem\n\nnecessary.\nSection 51\ngrants a wide discretion to the UIDAI to delegate any of\n\nits powers and functions.\n\nSection 55\nrequires every rule and regulation made under the Aadhaar Act to\n\nbe laid down before each House of Parliament. The Section states:\n\n“55. Laying of rules and regulations before Parliament.-\n\nEvery rule and every regulation made under this Act shall be\nlaid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House\nof Parliament, while it is in session, for a total period of thirty\ndays which may be comprised in one session or in two or\nmore successive sessions, and if, before the expiry of the\nsession immediately following the session or the successive\nsessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in making any\nmodification in the rule or regulation, or both the Houses\nagree that the rule or regulation should not be made, the rule\nor regulation shall thereafter have effect only in such modified\nform or be of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that\nPART E\n\nany such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice\nto the validity of anything previously done under that rule or\nregulation.”\n\nUIDAI needs to place the regulations framed by it before Parliament.\n\n53 The architecture of Aadhaar is integral to the exercise of analyzing the\n\nreasonableness of the entire project. Whether the architecture addresses the\n\nconcerns raised by the petitioners is an essential component of this exercise.\n\nThe architecture of Aadhaar must pass the constitutional requirements of\n\nreasonableness and proportionality. This aspect will be dealt under the\n\nheading of “proportionality” in a subsequent part of this judgment.\n\nE Passage of Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill\n\n54 The petitioners challenge the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act,\n\ncontending that it could not have been passed as a Money Bill. According to\n\nthe submission, the Aadhaar Act did not qualify as a Money Bill under\nArticle\nof the Constitution, and it legislates on matters which fall outside that\n\nprovision. The Attorney General for India submitted that the Constitution\n\naccords finality to the decision of the Speaker as to whether a Bill is a Money\n\nBill and hence the question whether the Aadhaar Act fulfils the requirements\n\nof being categorized as Money Bill is not open to judicial review. The Attorney\n\nGeneral also urged that the Aadhaar Act does fall under\nArticle 110.\n\nArticle 110\nprovides thus:\nPART E\n\n“(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a Bill shall be deemed\nto be a Money Bill if it contains only provisions dealing with all\nor any of the following matters, namely:—\n\n(a) the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation\nof any tax;\n\n(b) the regulation of the borrowing of money or the giving of\nany guarantee by the Government of India, or the amendment\nof the law with respect to any financial obligations undertaken\nor to be undertaken by the Government of India;\n\n(c) the custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency\nFund of India, the payment of moneys into or the withdrawal\nof moneys from any such Fund;\n\n(d) the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Fund\nof India;\n\n(e) the declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure\ncharged on the Consolidated Fund of India or the increasing\nof the amount of any such expenditure;\n\n(f) the receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund\nof India or the public account of India or the custody or issue\nof such money or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of\na State; or\n\n(g) any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in\nsub-clauses (a) to (f).\n\n(2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money Bill by reason\nonly that it provides for the imposition of fines or other\npecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for\nlicences or fees for services rendered, or by reason that it\nprovides for the imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or\nregulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local\npurposes.\n\n(3) If any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not,\nthe decision of the Speaker of the House of the People\nthereon shall be final.\n\n(4) There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is\ntransmitted to the Council of States under\narticle 109\n, and\nwhen it is presented to the President for assent under\narticle\n, the certificate of the Speaker of the House of the People\nsigned by him that it is a Money Bill.”\n\n55 The key questions before this Court are:\n\n(i) Whether under\nArticle 110(3)\n, the decision of the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha, that a Bill is a Money Bill, is immune from judicial review;\nPART E\n\n(ii) If the answer to (i) is in the negative, whether the Aadhaar Act is a Money\n\nBill under Article 110(1) of the Constitution; and\n\n(iii) If the Bill to enact the Aadhaar Act was not a Money Bill, whether a\n\ndeclaration of unconstitutionality will result from its legislative passage as\n\na Money Bill in the Lok Sabha.\n\nE.I Judicial Review of the Speaker’s Decision\nArticle 109\nprovides for a special procedure in respect of Money Bills. It\n\nprovides that a Money Bill shall not be introduced in the Council of States, the\n\nRajya Sabha. After a Money Bill is introduced in the Lok Sabha and passed by\n\nit, the Bill has to be transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its recommendations.\n\nArticle 110(4)\nprovides that when a ‘Money Bill’ is transmitted from the Lower\n\nHouse to the Upper House, it must be endorsed with a certificate by the\n\nSpeaker of the Lower House that it is a Money Bill. From the date of the\n\nreceipt of the Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha is bound to return the Bill to the Lok\n\nSabha, within a period of fourteen days, with its recommendations. The Lok\n\nSabha has the discretion to “either accept or reject all or any of the\n\nrecommendations” made by the Rajya Sabha.67 If the Lok Sabha accepts any\n\nof the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is deemed to\n\nhave been passed by both Houses of the Parliament “with the amendments\n\nrecommended” by the Rajya Sabha and accepted by the Lok Sabha.68\nArticle 109(2)\n, The Constitution of India\nArticle 109(3)\n, The Constitution of India\nPART E\n\nHowever, when the Lok Sabha “does not accept any of the recommendations”\n\nof the Rajya Sabha, the Money Bill is said to have been passed by both\n\nHouses in the form in which it was originally passed by the Lok Sabha.69 If a\n\nMoney Bill after being passed by the Lok Sabha and transmitted to the Rajya\n\nSabha for its recommendations is not returned to the Lok Sabha within a\n\nperiod of fourteen days, it is then deemed to have been passed by both the\n\nHouses of the Parliament in the form in which it was originally passed by the\n\nLok Sabha.70 When a Money Bill has been passed by the Houses of the\n\nParliament,\nArticle 111\nrequires it to be presented to the President along with\n\nthe Lok Sabha Speaker’s certificate for assent71.\nArticle 117(1)\nalso provides\n\nthat a Bill “making provision for any of the matters specified in sub-clauses (a)\n\nto (f) of clause (1) of article 110” shall also not be introduced in the Rajya\n\nSabha.\n\n57 The Constitution contains corresponding provisions for Money Bills\n\nintroduced in and passed by a state legislative assembly.\nArticle 198\nprovides\n\na special procedure for Money Bills in the state legislative assembly.\nArticle\n\n199(3)\nprovides for the finality of the decision of the Speaker of the Legislative\n\nAssembly. Under\nArticle 200\n, when a Money Bill has been passed by the\n\nState Legislature, it is to be presented to the Governor, along with the\n\nSpeaker’s certificate, for assent.72\nArticle 109(4)\n, The Constitution of India\nArticle 109(5)\n, The Constitution of India\nArticle 110(4)\n, The Constitution of India\nArticle 199(4)\n, The Constitution of India\nPART E\n\nArticle 107\ncontains provisions for the introduction and passing of Bills in\n\ngeneral and provides thus:\n\n“(1) Subject to the provisions of\narticles 109\nand\nwith\nrespect to Money Bills and other financial Bills, a Bill may\noriginate in either House of Parliament.\n(2) Subject to the provisions of\narticles 108\nand\n, a Bill\nshall not be deemed to have been passed by the Houses\nof Parliament unless it has been agreed to by both\nHouses, either without amendment or with such\namendments only as are agreed to by both Houses.\n(3) A Bill pending in Parliament shall not lapse by reason of\nthe prorogation of the Houses.\n\n(4) A Bill pending in the Council of States which has not been\npassed by the House of the People shall not lapse on a\ndissolution of the House of the People.\n\n(5) A Bill which is pending in the House of the People, or\nwhich having been passed by the House of the People is\npending in the Council of States, shall, subject to the\nprovisions of\narticle 108\n, lapse on a dissolution of the House\nof the People.”\n\n58 Ordinary bills can be passed only when they are agreed to by both\n\nHouses. Amendments suggested by one House have to be agreed upon by\n\nboth the Houses for the bill to be passed. Both Houses of Parliament have a\n\nvital role assigned by the Constitution in the passage of ordinary bills.\n\nDeviating from the important role which it assigns to the Rajya Sabha in the\n\npassage of legislation, the Constitution carves out a limited role for the Rajya\n\nSabha in the passage of Money Bills.\n\n59 The Constitution confers special powers on the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha in the passage of a Money Bill. Ordinary bills (other than Money Bills)\n\ncan originate in either House of Parliament. They can be scrutinised, debated\n\nin and amended in both the Houses of Parliament during the course of\nPART E\n\npassage. A Bill is not regarded as being passed by Parliament until both the\n\nHouses agree to its passage without amendments or with the amendments as\n\nproposed. A constitutional discretion is conferred on the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha to decide whether a Bill is a Money Bill. When the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha declares a Bill to be a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha is left only with the\n\noption to make recommendations to the Bill within the deadline of fourteen\n\ndays. Being only recommendations, they do not bind the Lok Sabha. They\n\nmay either be accepted or rejected by the Lok Sabha.\n\n60 The Rajya Sabha is a constitutional body in a bicameral legislature. The\n\nmakers of the Constitution adopted bicameralism from Britain. The origin of\n\nthe limited role that the Upper House has in the passing of a Money Bill can\n\nbe traced to the British Parliament Act, 1911, which will be discussed in a\n\nsubsequent part of this analysis. The draftspersons of the Constitution were\n\nconscious of the impact of a misuse of institutional power. They provided for a\n\ndetailed blue print of the architecture of constitutional governance. It is\n\nnecessary to understand our constitutional history in order to comprehend the\n\nscope of the finality attributed to the Speaker’s decision on whether or not a\n\nBill is a Money Bill.\n\n61 The origins of the procedure of passing Money Bills in the United\n\nKingdom are older than the Parliament Act of 1911. The authoritative\nPART E\n\ntreatise73, by Thomas Erskine May, on the law, privileges, proceedings and\n\nusage of Parliament in Britain dwells on the history of the evolution of the\n\nrelationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords with\n\nregard to their powers of taxation and in relation to national revenue and\n\npublic expenditure.74\n\nA grant imposed by the House of Commons would become law in effect, only\n\nafter the assent of the House of Lords and of the Queen.75 While the House of\n\nCommons enjoyed the legal right to originate grants for nearly 300 years, the\n\nHouse of Lords was originally not precluded from amending a Bill. But in\n\n167176 and 167877 respectively, the Commons passed two resolutions to\n\ncurtail the powers of the House of Lords so that only the Commons had the\n\nsole right to direct or limit the scope of a Bill regarding taxation and\n\ngovernment expenditure. The House of Lords was excluded from altering any\n\nsuch Bill.\n\nThe exclusion of the Lords was so strictly followed that the Commons even\n\ndenied to the former, the power of authorising the taking of fees, imposing\n\n73 Thomas Erskine May, A treatise on the law, privileges, proceedings and usage of Parliament, Ninth Edition\n\n(1883)\nIbid, at pages 637-638. It notes: “At length, when the Commons had increased in political influence, and the\nsubsidies voted by them had become the principal source of national revenue, they gradually assumed their\npresent position in regard to taxation and supply, and included the Lords as well as themselves in their grants.\nSo far back as 1407, it was stated by King Henry IV, in the ordinance called “The Indemnity of the Lords and\nCommons”, that grants were “granted by the Commons, and assented to by the Lords”.”\n75 Ibid, at page 638\n76 Ibid, at page 641. The Resolution stated: “That in all aids given to the king by the Commons, the rate or tax\n\nought not to be altered”.\n\n77 Ibid. The Resolution stated: “That all aids and supplies, and aids to his Majesty in Parliament, are the sole gift\n\nof the Commons ; and all bills for the granting of any such aids and supplies ought to begin with the Commons\n: and that it is the undoubted and sole right of the Commons to direct, limit, and appoint in such bills the ends,\npurposes, considerations, conditions, limitations, and qualifications of such grants ; which ought not to be\nchanged or altered by the House of Lords.”\nPART E\n\npecuniary penalties or of varying the mode of suing for them, or of applying\n\nthem when recovered, though such provisions were necessary to give effect\n\nto the general enactments of a Bill.78 Since this strict enforcement was found\n\nto be “attended with unnecessary inconvenience”, it led to the adopting of a\n\nStanding Order in 1849 which accommodated space to the House of Lords for\n\nsuggesting amendments on legislative issues.79 However, the constitutional\n\nskirmishes continued. They eventually led to the passage of the Parliament\n\nAct of 1911, which essentially deprived the House of Lords of the right to\n\nreject Money Bills.\n\n62 The Parliament Act 1911 was explicitly aimed at “regulating the\n\nrelations between the two Houses of Parliament”80. The Preamble of the Act\n\nindicates that it was enacted for “restricting the existing powers of the House\n\nof Lords”81.\nSection 1(1)\nprovides for the power of the House of Lords on\n\nMoney Bills:\n\n“If a Money Bill, having been passed by the House of\nCommons, and sent up to the House of Lords at least one\nmonth before the end of the session, is not passed by the\nHouse of Lords without amendment within one month after it\nis so sent up to that House, the Bill shall, unless the House of\nCommons direct to the contrary, be present to His Majesty\nand become an Act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being\nsignified, notwithstanding that the House of Lords have not\nconsented to the Bill.”\n\n“Money Bill” was defined statutorily for the first time.\nSection 1(2)\nprovided:\n\n78 Ibid, at pages 642-643\n79 Ibid, pages 646-647\n80 Preamble of the Parliament Act 1911\n81 Ibid\nPART E\n\n“A Money Bill means a Public Bill which in the opinion of the\nSpeaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions\ndealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the\nimposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of\ntaxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other\nfinancial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, [the\nNational Loans Fund] or on money provided by Parliament, or\nthe variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the\nappropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of\npublic money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the\nrepayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those\nsubjects or any of them. In this subsection the expressions\n“taxation”, “public money”, and “loan” respectively do not\ninclude any taxation, money, or loan raised by local\nauthorities or bodies for local purposes.”\n\nThe use of the expression “means” in the definition of a Money Bill indicates it\n\nwas exhaustively defined. A Bill would be a Money Bill, if the Speaker of the\n\nHouse of Commons opined that it contains “only” certain specific provisions.\n\nUnder\nSection 1(3)\n, when a Money Bill is sent up to the House of Lords and to\n\nHer Majesty for assent, it should be endorsed by a certificate of the Speaker\n\nof the House of Commons that it is a Money Bill. This sub-section also\n\nprovides that before giving his certificate, the Speaker may consult “two\n\nmembers to be appointed from the Chairman’s Panel at the beginning of each\n\nSession by the Committee of Selection”. Therefore, the Speaker has to certify\n\nany bill which in his or her opinion falls within the definition of a Money Bill.\n\nAny bill containing provisions outside the definition would not be certified as a\n\nMoney Bill. The Speaker does not certify a Bill until it has reached the form in\n\nwhich it will leave the House of Commons, that is, at the end of its Commons\nPART E\n\nstage. The Speaker can only decide whether or not to certify a Bill once it has\n\npassed the House.82\n\nSection 3\nof the 1911 Act provides finality to the certificate issued by the\n\nSpeaker and renders it immune from judicial review. According to it:\n\n“Any certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons\ngiven under this Act shall be conclusive for all purposes,\nand shall not be questioned in any court of law.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Act\nprovides finality to the decision of the Speaker of the House of\n\nCommons. By using the phrase “shall not be questioned in any court of law”,\n\nthe Act grants immunity to the Speaker’s decision from judicial review.\n\nThe statutory concept of a ‘Money Bill’ and the Speaker’s certification of a Bill\n\nas a ‘Money Bill’ introduced by the Parliament Act, 1911 ultimately found its\n\nway into the Constitution of India, but with significant modifications.\n\n63 In India, the categorization of Money Bills can be said to have begun\n\nfrom the Commonwealth of India Bill 1925, which was drafted by a National\n\nConvention comprised of 250 members, with Tej Bahadur Sapru as its\n\nChairman.\nArticle 36\nof the Commonwealth Bill provided:\n\n“36. (a) Any Bill which appropriates revenue or moneys for\nthe ordinary annual services of the Government shall deal\nonly with such appropriation.\n\n82 House of Lords, Select Committee on the Constitution, Money Bills and Commons Financial Privilege (2011),\navailable at https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldconst/97/97.pdf\nPART E\n\n(b) Bills imposing taxation· shall deal only with the imposition\nof taxes, and any provision therein dealing with any other\nmatter shall be of no effect.\n\n(c) Bills for the appropriation of revenues or moneys or\nimposing taxation shall be introduced only by a member of\nthe Cabinet, and can only originate in the Legislative\nAssembly.”\n\nThe Bill neither provided a definition of a Money Bill nor did it discuss the role\n\nof the Speaker of the Assembly of elected representatives.\n\nIn its Madras session of December 1927, the Indian National Congress, as a\n\nresponse to the setting up of the Simon Commission (which did not have any\n\nIndian members) decided to set up an All Parties’ Conference to draft a\n\nConstitution for India. With Motilal Nehru as the Chairman of the Committee\n\nconstituted by the All Parties’ Conference, a Report was prepared.\nArticle 17\n\nof the Nehru Report provided a definition of a Money Bill:\n\n“17. A money bill means a bill which contains only provisions\ndealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely the\nimposition, repeal, remission, alteration or regulation of\ntaxation; the imposition, for the payment of debt or other\nfinancial purposes, of charges on public revenues or monies,\nor the variation or repeal of any such charges; the supply,\nappropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of\npublic money; the raising of any loan or the repayment\nthereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or\nany of them. In this definition the expression “taxation”,\n“public money” and “loan” respectively do not include any\ntaxation, money or loan raised by local authorities or bodies\nfor local purposes.”\n\nThe definition of a Money Bill in the Nehru Report, was drawn from the\n\nParliament Act, 1911 in Britain.\nArticle 18\nof the Report provided that the\n\n“question whether a bill is or is not a money bill will be decided by the\nPART E\n\npresident of the House of Representatives”. The House of Representatives\n\n(the Lower House) was provided the final authority to either accept or reject\n\nthe recommendations made by the Senate (the Upper House).\nArticle 19\nof\n\nthe Report provided thus:\n\n“A money bill passed by the House of Representatives shall\nbe sent to the Senate for its recommendations and it shall be\nreturned not later than… days therefrom to the House of\nRepresentatives, which may pass it, accepting or rejecting all\nor any of the recommendations of the Senate; and the bill so\npassed shall be deemed to have been passed by both\nchambers.”\n\nWhile the Constituent Assembly of India was in session, the Socialist Party of\n\nIndia came up with a “Draft Constitution of the Republic of India”, based on its\n\nideologies.\nArticle 147\nof its Draft Constitution provided:\n\n“147. (1) A Bill making provision-\n\n(a) for imposing, abolishing, remitting, altering or regulating\nany tax ; or\n\n(b) for regulating the borrowing of money, or giving any\nguarantee by the Government, or for amending the law with\nrespect to any financial obligations undertaken or to be\nundertaken by the Government; or\n\n(c) for declaring any expenditure to be expenditure charged\non the public revenues, or for increasing the amount of any\nsuch expenditure\nshall be deemed as a money Bill and shall not be introduced\nor moved except on the recommendation of the Government.\n(2) A Bill or amendment shall not be deemed to make\nprovision for any of the purposes aforesaid by reason only\nthat it provides for the Imposition of fines or other pecuniary\npenalties, or for the demand and payment of fees for licenses\nor fees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for\nthe imposition, abolition, remission, alteration, or regulation of\ntax by any local authority or body for local purposes.\n(3) In case of dispute whether a Bill is a money Bill or not, the\ndecision of the Speaker, or in his absence of the Deputy\nSpeaker, shall be final.”\nPART E\n\nThe Draft Constitution of the Socialist Party conferred a discretion on the\n\nSpeaker of the Lower House, and in his absence, on the Deputy Speaker, to\n\ndecide whether a Bill is a Money Bill.\n\n64 There was another model present before the makers of the Indian\n\nConstitution. British India was governed by the provisions of the\nGovernment\n\nof India Act, 1935\n, which provided for two Houses of Parliament − the Council\n\nof States (Upper House) and Federal Assembly (Lower House).\nSection 37\nof\n\nthe Government of India Act 1935 made special provisions for financial bills:\n\n“37.-(1) A Bill or amendment making provision- (a) for\nimposing or increasing any tax; or (b) for regulating the\nborrowing of money or the giving of any guarantee by the\nFederal Government, or for amending the law with respect to\nany financial obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by\nthe Federal Government ; or (c) for declaring any expenditure\nto be expenditure charged on the revenues of the Federation,\nor for increasing the amount of any such expenditure, shall\nnot be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of\nthe Governor-General, and a Bill making such provision shall\nnot be introduced in the Council of State.”\n\nUnder the 1935 Act, there was no provision for a Speaker’s certificate\n\nregarding a Financial Bill.\nSection 38(1)\nauthorized each House to make rules\n\nregulating its procedure and for the conduct of its business, subject to the\n\nprovisions of the Act.\n\nA Financial Bill could be introduced only “on the recommendation of the\n\nGovernor-General”.\nSection 41\nprovided a general immunity from judicial\n\nreview on the “ground of any alleged irregularity of procedure”:\nPART E\n\n“41(1). The validity of any proceedings in the Federal\nLegislature shall not be called in question on the ground of\nany alleged irregularity of procedure.\n\n(2) No officer or other member of the Legislature in whom\npowers are vested by or under this Act for regulating\nprocedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining\norder, in the Legislature shall be subject to the jurisdiction of\nany court in respect of the exercise by him of those powers.”\n\nThe Constituent Assembly evidently had these legislative precedents relating\n\nto Money Bills which it would have considered while formulating its drafts.\n\n65 While the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly were in motion, Sir\n\nB N Rau, as its constitutional advisor, prepared a memorandum of the Draft\n\nConstitution for the Union Constitution Committee. It envisaged a Parliament\n\nof the Union consisting of the President and two Houses—the Senate and the\n\nHouse of Representatives.83 One of the proposals discussed in the meetings\n\nof the Union Constitution Committee was that “Money Bills would originate in\n\nthe House of the People and the power of the other House would be limited to\n\nmaking suggestions for amendment, which the House of the People could\n\naccept or reject”.84 B Shiva Rao has recorded what transpired during the\n\ncourse of the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly:\n\n“The Draft also included provisions regarding legislative\nprocedure, procedure in financial matters and general\nprocedure for the conduct of business. No Bill could be\nsubmitted for the President’s assent unless it had been\npassed in identical form by both Houses. Except in the case\nof Money Bills, both Houses enjoyed equal powers; and\ndifference between the two Houses were to be settled by a\nmajority vote in a joint sitting of both Houses convened by the\nPresident… Money Bills were defined in the Draft as\n\n83 B Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: A Study, Indian Institution of Public Administration (1968), at\npage 420\n84 Ibid\nPART E\n\ncomprising Bills proposing the imposition or increase of any\ntax, regulating the borrowing of money by the Government of\nIndia or the giving of financial guarantees, or declaring any\nitem of expenditure as ‘‘charged” on the revenues, i.e. placing\nit outside the vote of the House of the People. The general\nprinciple approved by the Constituent Assembly was that\nfinancial control over the executive would' be - exercised by\nthe House of the People. Accordingly the Draft provided that\nMoney Bills could originate only in that House. The powers of\nthe Council of States in the case of Money Bills were\nrestricted to making suggestions for amendment. If these\nsuggestions were, not accepted by the House of the People,\nor if the Council of States did not return a Bill within thirty\ndays with its suggestions for amendment, the Bill would be\n‘deemed to have been' passed by both Houses in the form in\nwhich it was passed' by the House of the People” and\nsubmitted to the President for his assent’.”85\n\n66 The draft prepared by the Constitutional Advisor provided a definition of\n\na Money Bill, which was inspired by\nSection 37\nof the Government of India\n\nAct 1935, Section 53 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act\n\n190086 and\nArticle 22\nof the Constitution of Ireland 1937.87\nArticle 75\nof this\n\ndraft of the Constitution provided that “if any question arises whether a Bill is a\n\n‘money bill’ or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People\n\nthereon shall be final.”88 Neither\nSection 37\nof the Government of India Act\n\n1935 nor Section 53 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900\n\n85 Ibid, at pages 427-428\n86 The said provision provides: “Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation.\nProposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a\nproposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its\ncontaining provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand\nor payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law. The Senate may\nnot amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the\nordinary annual services of the Government. The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase\nany proposed charge or burden on the people. The Senate may at any stage return to the House of\nRepresentatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or\namendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any\nof such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. Except as provided in this section, the Senate\nshall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.”\n87 B Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: Selected Documents, Indian Institution of Public\n\nAdministration (2012), at page 32, as quoted in Pratik Datta, Shefali Malhotra & Shivangi Tyagi, Judicial\nReview and Money Bills, NUJS Law Review (2017)\n88 Ibid\nPART E\n\nhas a similar provision which accords legal finality to the decision of the\n\nSpeaker. The draft provision was similar to\nArticle 22\nof the Constitution of\n\nIreland 1937, which provides:\n\n“1. The Chairman of Dáil Éireann89 shall certify any Bill\nwhich, in his opinion, is a Money Bill to be a Money Bill,\nand his certificate shall, subject to the subsequent\nprovisions of this section, be final and conclusive.\n\n2. Seanad Éireann90, by a resolution, passed at a sitting at\nwhich not less than thirty members are present, may request\nthe President to refer the question whether the Bill is or is not\na Money Bill to a Committee of Privileges.\n\n3. If the President after consultation with the Council of State\ndecides to accede to the request he shall appoint a\nCommittee of Privileges consisting of an equal number of\nmembers of Dáil Éireann and of Seanad Éireann and a\nChairman who shall be a Judge of the Supreme Court: these\nappointments shall be made after consultation with the\nCouncil of State. In the case of an equality of votes but not\notherwise the Chairman shall be entitled to vote.\n\n4. The President shall refer the question to the Committee of\nPrivileges so appointed and the Committee shall report its\ndecision thereon to the President within twenty-one days after\nthe day on which the Bill was sent to Seanad Éireann.\n\n5. The decision of the Committee shall be final and\nconclusive.\n\n6. If the President after consultation with the Council of State\ndecides not to accede to the request of Seanad Éireann, or if\nthe Committee of Privileges fails to report within the time\nhereinbefore specified the certificate of the Chairman of Dáil\nÉireann shall stand confirmed.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n67 The draft prepared by the Advisor to the Constituent Assembly did not\n\nadopt the above provision in its entirety. It adopted the part on the finality of\n\nthe certification of the Speaker on whether a Bill is a Money Bill. The Irish\n\nmodel of dispute resolution, which provided for a mechanism to review the\n\nSpeaker’s certification, was not adopted.\n\n89 Lower House in Ireland\n90 Upper House in Ireland\nPART E\n\nSubsequently, in its report submitted to the President of the Constituent\n\nAssembly on 5 December 1947, the Expert Committee on Financial\n\nProvisions suggested an amendment to the draft provision, to the effect that:\n\n“When a Money Bill is sent from the Lower House to the\nUpper, a certificate of the Speaker of the Lower House saying\nthat it is a Money Bill should be attached to, or endorsed on,\nthe bill and a provision to that effect should be made in the\nConstitution on the lines of the corresponding provision in the\nParliament Act, 1911. This will prevent controversies\nabout the matter outside the Lower House.”91 (Emphasis\nsupplied)\n\nCertification of any Bill by the Speaker of the Lower House as a Money Bill,\n\nwas envisaged for procedural simplicity to avoid causing confusion in the\n\nUpper House of Parliament.\n\n68 The final provision which has assumed the form of\nArticle 110\nof the\n\nConstitution, does not contain the exact language used in the Act of 1911.\n\nThe 1911 Act of the British Parliament consciously excluded judicial review of\n\nthe certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons. The intention of the\n\nBritish Parliament is clear from the specific language used in\nSection 3\nof the\n\nAct.\nSection 3\naccords finality to the decision of the Speaker by providing that\n\nany certificate of the Speaker of the House of Commons “shall be conclusive\n\nfor all purposes, and shall not be questioned in any court of law”. The\n\ncertification of the Speaker is both conclusive and immune from judicial\n\nreview. The framers of the Indian Constitution did not adopt this language.\n\n91 B Shiva Rao, The Framing of India’s Constitution: Selected Documents, Indian Institution of Public\nAdministration, at page 281\nPART E\n\nRather, they chose to adopt the phrase “shall be final”. The phrase used in the\n\nAct of 1911 expressly excluded courts from exercising their power of judicial\n\nreview over the decision of the Speaker of the House of Commons. This\n\nlanguage was used in the 1911 Act to put an end to the constitutional\n\nskirmishes experienced by the House of Lords and the House of Commons in\n\nBritain for more than five hundred years, leading to the enactment of the 1911\n\nAct.92 The deviation from incorporating the language, used in the 1911 Act,\n\ninto the Indian Constitution is reflective of the intention of our Constitution\n\nmakers that they did not want to confer the same status on the power\n\nassigned to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, as is provided to the Speaker of\n\nthe House of Commons. Had their intention been otherwise, they would have\n\nused the same language as that provided under the 1911 Act. Finality would\n\noperate as between the Houses of Parliament. It did not exclude judicial\n\nreview by a constitutional Court.\n\n69 The British legal system adopts the principle of parliamentary\n\nsovereignty. That is not so in India. Ours is a system founded on the\n\nsupremacy of the Constitution. Judicial review is an essential component of\n\nconstitutional supremacy. A Constitution Bench of this Court in\nKalpana\n\nMehta v Union of India93\nhas, while noticing this distinction, held:\n\n“…The fundamental difference between the two systems lies\nin the fact that parliamentary sovereignty in the Westminster\nform of government in the UK has given way, in the Indian\nConstitution, to constitutional supremacy. Constitutional\n\n92 Pratik Datta, Shefali Malhotra & Shivangi Tyagi, Judicial Review and Money Bills, NUJS Law Review (2017)\n93 (2018) 7 SCC 1\nPART E\n\nsupremacy mandates that every institution of governance is\nsubject to the norms embodied in the constitutional text. The\nConstitution does not allow for the existence of absolute\npower in the institutions which it creates. Judicial review as a\npart of the basic features of the Constitution is intended to\nensure that every institution acts within its bounds and\nlimits.”94\n\n70 The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that constitutional principles\n\nprevail in interpretation and governance. Institutions created by the\n\nConstitution are subject to its norms. No constitutional institution wields\n\nabsolute power. No immunity has been attached to the certificate of the\n\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha from judicial review, for this reason. The\n\nConstitution makers have envisaged a role for the judiciary as the expounder\n\nof the Constitution. The provisions relating to the judiciary, particularly those\n\nregarding the power of judicial review, were framed, as Granville Austin\n\nobserved, with “idealism”95. Courts of the country are expected to function as\n\nguardians of the Constitution and its values. Constitutional courts have been\n\nentrusted with the duty to scrutinize the exercise of power by public\n\nfunctionaries under the Constitution. No individual holding an institutional\n\noffice created by the Constitution can act contrary to constitutional\n\nparameters. Judicial review protects the principles and the spirit of the\n\nConstitution. Judicial review is intended as a check against arbitrary conduct\n\nof individuals holding constitutional posts. It holds public functionaries\n\naccountable to constitutional duties. If our Constitution has to survive the\n\nvicissitudes of political aggrandisement and to face up to the prevailing\n\n94 Ibid, at para 227\n95 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1966), at page 205\nPART E\n\ncynicism about all constitutional institutions, notions of power and authority\n\nmust give way to duties and compliance with the rule of law. Constitutional\n\ninstitutions cannot be seen as focal points for the accumulation of power and\n\nprivilege. They are held in trust by all those who occupy them for the moment.\n\nThe impermanence of power is a sombre reflection for those who occupy\n\nconstitutional offices. The Constitution does not contemplate a debasement of\n\nthe institutions which it creates. The office of the Speaker of the House of\n\nPeople, can be no exception. The decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha in\n\ncertifying a Bill as a Money Bill is liable to be tested upon the touchstone of its\n\ncompliance with constitutional principles. Nor can such a decision of the\n\nSpeaker take leave of constitutional morality.\n\n71 Our Constitution does not provide absolute power to any institution. It\n\nsets the limits for each institution. Our constitutional scheme envisages a\n\nsystem of checks and balances. The power of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha,\n\nto decide whether a Bill is a Money Bill, cannot be untrammelled. The\n\ncontention that the decision of Speaker is immune from judicial review and\n\ncannot be questioned, is contrary to the entire scheme of the Constitution,\n\nwhich is premised on transparency, non-arbitrariness and fairness. The\n\nphrase “shall be final” used in\nArticle 110(3)\nhas been adopted, as mentioned\n\nearlier, from\nArticle 22\nof the Irish Constitution. The provisions of\nArticle 22\nof\n\nthe Irish Constitution provide a mechanism for review of the certificate issued\n\nby the Speaker. Recourse is provided under the Irish Constitution by which\nPART E\n\nthe members of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament can request the\n\nPresident of Ireland to refer the question of whether a Bill is a Money Bill, to a\n\nCommittee of Privileges. If the President refers the question to this\n\nCommittee, the decision of the Committee stands “final and conclusive”. The\n\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly did not adopt this mechanism. Absence\n\nof this mechanism does not mean that the decision of the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha cannot be subject to checks and balances, of which judicial review is\n\nan indispensable facet. The Speaker has to act within the domain, which the\n\nConstitution accords to the office of the Speaker. The power conferred on the\n\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha cannot be exercised arbitrarily, for it could damage\n\nthe scheme of the Constitution. Judicial review is the ultimate remedy to\n\nensure that the Speaker does not act beyond constitutional entrustment.\n\n72 The scope of the phrase “shall be final” can also be understood by\n\nlooking at the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly. The constitutional\n\nfoundation of\nArticle 110(4)\nis based upon a suggestion of the Expert\n\nCommittee on Financial Provisions that when a Money Bill is transmitted from\n\nthe Lower House to the Upper House, it should be endorsed by the Speaker’s\n\ncertificate, so as to prevent any controversy “about the matter outside the\n\nLower House”. Therefore, the finality provided to the decision of the Speaker\n\nas to whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, is aimed at avoiding any\n\ncontroversy on the issue in the Rajya Sabha and before the President. Had it\n\nbeen intended to prevent the court from adjudicating upon the validity of the\nPART E\n\ndecision of the Speaker, the language of the Article would have made it\n\nexplicit. Where a constitutional provision evinces a specific intent to exclude\n\njudicial review, clear words to that effect are used.\nArticles 243O(a) 96\n,\n\n243ZG(a)97\nand\n329(a)\nspecifically use the phrase − “shall not be called in\n\nquestion in any court”. For instance,\nArticle 329(a)\nprovides thus:\n\n“Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution —\n\n(a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of\nconstituencies or the allotment of seats to such\nconstituencies, made or purporting to be made under\narticle\nor\narticle 328\n, shall not be called in question in any\ncourt.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n73 In\nN P Ponnuswami v Returning Officer, Namakkal Constituency,\n\nNamakkal, Salem District98\n, a six judge Bench of this Court, while construing\n\nthe provisions of\nArticle 329\n, compared it to the preceding Articles, and held\n\nthus:\n\n“5…A notable difference in the language used in\narticles 327\n\nand\non the one hand, and\narticle 329\non the other, is that\nwhile the first two articles begin with the words “subject to the\nprovisions of this Constitution”, the last article begins with the\nwords “notwithstanding anything in this Constitution”. It was\nconceded at the Bar that the effect of this difference in\nlanguage is that whereas any law made by Parliament under\n\narticle 327\n, or by the State Legislature under\narticle 328\n,\ncannot exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court under\narticle\nof the Constitution, that jurisdiction is excluded in regard\nto matters provided for in article 329.”99\nArticle 243O(a)\n, which is a part of the chapter on Panchayats, provides: “Notwithstanding anything in this\nConstitution,— (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats\nto such constituencies, made or purporting to be made under\narticle 243K\n, shall not be called in question in any\ncourt.”\nArticle 243ZG(a)\n, which is a part of the chapter on Municipalities, provides: “Notwithstanding anything in this\n\nConstitution,— (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats\nto such constituencies, made or purporting to be made under\narticle 243ZA\nshall not be called in question in\nany court.”\n98 1952 SCR 218\n99 Ibid, at para 5\nPART E\n\n74 In order to understand the scope of the finality attached to the\n\nSpeaker’s decision under\nArticle 110(3)\n, it would be useful to analyse how in\n\nthe case of other constitutional provisions, the words “shall be final” have been\n\ninterpreted by this Court.\nArticles 217(3)100\n, 311(3)101\nand paragraph 6(1) of\n\nthe Tenth Schedule102 contain the phrase “shall be final”.\nIn\nUnion of India v\n\nJyoti Prakash Mitter103\n, this Court held that it can examine the legality of an\n\norder passed by the President on the determination of the age of a Judge of\n\nthe High Court under\nArticle 217 (3)\nof the Constitution. The six judge Bench\n\nheld:\n\n“32…The President acting under\nArticle 217(3)\nperforms a\njudicial function of grave importance under the scheme of our\nConstitution. He cannot act on the advice of his Ministers.\nNotwithstanding the declared finality of the order of the\nPresident the Court has jurisdiction in appropriate cases to\nset aside the order, if it appears that it was passed on\ncollateral considerations or the rules of natural justice were\nnot observed, or that the President's judgment was coloured\nby the advice or representation made by the executive or it\nwas founded on no evidence…Appreciation of evidence is\nentirely left to the President and it is not for the Courts to hold\nthat on the evidence placed before the President on which the\nconclusion is founded, if they were called upon to decide the\ncase they would have reached some other conclusion.”104\n\nThe President was held to perform a judicial function in making a\n\ndetermination under\nArticle 217(3).\nArticle 217 (3)\nstates: “If any question arises as to the age of a Judge of a High Court, the question shall be\ndecided by the President after consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the decision of the President\nshall be final.”\nArticle 311(3)\nstates: “If, in respect of any such person as aforesaid, a question arises whether it is reasonably\n\npracticable to hold such inquiry as is referred to in clause (2), the decision thereon of the authority empowered\nto dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank shall be final.”\n102 Paragraph 6(1) states “If any question arises as to whether a member of a House has become subject to\n\ndisqualification under this Schedule, the question shall be referred for the decision of the Chairman, or, as the\ncase may be, the Speaker of such House and his decision shall be final:\n\nProvided that where the question which has arisen is as to whether the Chairman or the Speaker of a House\nhas become subject to such disqualification, the question shall be referred for the decision of such member of\nthe House as the House may elect in this behalf and his decision shall be final.”\n103 (1971) 1 SCC 396\n104 Ibid, at page 397\nPART E\n\nThe question of finality under\nArticle 311(3)\nwas dealt with by a Constitution\n\nBench of this Court in\nUnion of India v Tulsiram Patel105\n. The Court held that\n\nthe finality given to the decision of the disciplinary authority by\nArticle 311(3)\n\nthat it is not reasonably practicable to hold an enquiry, is not binding upon the\n\nCourt so far as its power of judicial review is concerned.\n\nThe constitutional validity of the provisions contained in the Tenth Schedule to\n\nthe Constitution came up for consideration before a Constitution Bench of this\n\nCourt in\nKihoto Hollohan v Zachillhu106\n. The Constitution Bench held that\n\nthe power vested in the Speaker or the Chairman under the Schedule, is a\n\njudicial power, and was amenable to judicial review:\n\n“111…That Paragraph 6(1) of the Tenth Schedule, to the\nextent it seeks to impart finality to the decision of the\nSpeakers/Chairmen is valid. But the concept of statutory\nfinality embodied in Paragraph 6(1) does not detract from\nor abrogate judicial review under\nArticles 136\n, 226\nand\nof the Constitution in so far as infirmities based on\nviolations of constitutional mandates, mala fides, non-\n\ncompliance with Rules of Natural Justice and perversity,\nare concerned.”107 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Bench had also clarified that:\n\n“101…The principle that is applied by the courts is that in\nspite of a finality clause it is open to the court to examine\nwhether the action of the authority under challenge is ultra\nvires the powers conferred on the said authority. Such an\naction can be ultra vires for the reason that it is in\ncontravention of a mandatory provision of the law conferring\non the authority the power to take such an action. It will also\nbe ultra vires the powers conferred on the authority if it is\n\n105 (1985) 3 SCC 398\n106 (1992) Supp (2) SCC 651\n107 Ibid, at page 711\nPART E\n\nvitiated by mala fides or is colourable exercise of power\nbased on extraneous and irrelevant considerations...”108\n\nUndoubtedly, the finality clauses contained in\nArticle 217(3)\n, 311(3)\nand in\n\nparagraph 6(1) of the Tenth Schedule were held not to exclude judicial review\n\nsince the essential nature of the power is judicial. A constitutional function is\n\nentrusted to the Speaker to certify a Bill as a Money Bill under\nArticle 110(3)\n,\n\nto which the attributes of a judicial power do not apply. Indeed, the power\n\nwhich is entrusted to the Speaker under\nArticle 110(3)\nis integral to the\n\nlegislative process. But, the fact that the authority which a constitutional\n\nfunctionary exercises is not of a judicial character, is not sufficient to lead to\n\nthe conclusion that a finality clause governing the exercise of that power\n\nmakes it immune from judicial review. Where the entrustment of the power is\n\nsubject to the due fulfilment of constitutional norms, the exercise of jurisdiction\n\nis amenable to judicial review, to the extent necessary to determine whether\n\nthere has been a violation of a constitutional mandate. The nature and extent\n\nof judicial review would undoubtedly vary from a situation where finality has\n\nbeen attached to a judicial, administrative or quasi-judicial power. However, a\n\nclause on finality notwithstanding, it is open to the constitutional court to\n\ndetermine as to whether there has been a violation of a constitutional mandate\n\nas a result of which the decision suffers from a constitutional infirmity. The\n\nentrustment of a constitutional function to the Speaker under\nArticle 110(3)\nto\n\ncertify a Bill as a Money Bill is premised on the fulfilment of the norms\n\nstipulated in\nArticle 110(1).\nA certification can be questioned on the ground\n108 Ibid, at page 708\nPART E\n\nthat the Bill did not fulfil the conditions stipulated in\nArticle 110(1)\nto be\n\ndesignated as a Money Bill. If that is established, the certification would be\n\ncontrary to constitutional mandate. Whether that is so can be judicially\n\nscrutinized.\n\n75 The notion that an entrustment of power is absolute has a colonial\n\norigin. Law under a colonial regime was not just an instrument to maintain\n\norder but was a source of subordination. Recognition of the vesting of\n\nabsolute authority was but a reflection of the premise that those who ruled\n\ncould not be questioned. Those who were ruled had to accept the authority of\n\nthe ruler. Nothing can be as divorced from constitutional principle as these\n\nnormative foundations of colonial law and history. The notion that power is\n\nabsolute is inconsistent with a Constitution which subjects the entrustment of\n\nfunctions to public functionaries to the restraints which accompany it. Our law\n\nmust recognise the need to liberate its founding principles from its colonial\n\npast. The Court should not readily accept the notion that the authority vested\n\nin a constitutional functionary is immune from judicial review. In the absence\n\nof a specific exclusion of judicial review, none can be implied. Moreover, any\n\nexclusion of judicial review must be tested on the anvil of its functionality. A\n\nspecific exclusion of judicial review, in order to be valid, must serve a\n\nconstitutional function. The test of functionality must relate to whether an\n\nexclusion of review is necessary to fulfil the overarching need for the proper\n\ndischarge of a constitutional role. Exclusion of review, to be valid, must fulfil\nPART E\n\nthe requirement of a constitutional necessity. Its purpose cannot be to shield\n\nan excess of power from being questioned before the Court. Nor is the fact\n\nthat a power is vested in a high functionary a ground to shield it from scrutiny.\n\nThe ultimate test is whether the exclusion of judicial review is express and\n\nspecific and, whether such an exclusion is designed to achieve a\n\nconstitutional purpose that meets the test of functionality, assessed in terms of\n\na constitutional necessity. In the seventh decade of the republic, our\n\ninterpretation of the Constitution must subserve the need to liberate it from its\n\ncolonial detritus.\n\nThis approach was adopted by a seven judge Bench of this Court in\nKrishna\n\nKumar Singh v State of Bihar109\n. While interpreting the ordinance making\n\npower of the Governor, the Court held that the interpretation of the\n\nConstitution must be “carefully structured” to ensure that the power remains\n\nwhat the framers of our Constitution intended it to be. The Bench held:\n\n“91…The issue which needs elaboration is whether an\nordinance which by its very nature has a limited life can bring\nabout consequences for the future (in terms of the creation of\nrights, privileges, liabilities and obligations) which will enure\nbeyond the life of the ordinance. In deciding this issue, the\ncourt must adopt an interpretation which furthers the\nbasic constitutional premise of legislative control over\nordinances. The preservation of this constitutional value\nis necessary for parliamentary democracy to survive on\nthe sure foundation of the Rule of law and collective\nresponsibility of the executive to the legislature. The\nsilences of the Constitution must be imbued with\nsubstantive content by infusing them with a meaning\nwhich enhances the Rule of law. To attribute to the\nexecutive as an incident of the power to frame ordinances, an\nunrestricted ability to create binding effects for posterity would\n\n109 (2017) 3 SCC 1\nPART E\n\nset a dangerous precedent in a parliamentary democracy.\n\nThe court's interpretation of the power to frame ordinances,\nwhich originates in the executive arm of government, cannot\nbe oblivious to the basic notion that the primary form of law\nmaking power is through the legislature...”110 (Emphasis\nsupplied)\n\nThe ordinance making power was held to be an exceptional power to meet a\n\n“constitutional necessity”.\n\n76 The marginal note to\nArticle 122\nis: “Courts not to inquire into\n\nproceedings of Parliament”. The Article reads thus:\n\n“122. (1) The validity of any proceedings in Parliament shall\nnot be called in question on the ground of any alleged\nirregularity of procedure.\n\n(2) No officer or member of Parliament in whom powers are\nvested by or under this Constitution for regulating procedure\nor the conduct of business, or for maintaining order, in\nParliament shall be subject to the jurisdiction of any court in\nrespect of the exercise by him of those powers.”\n\nThis Court must deal with the question whether the Speaker’s decision under\n\nArticle 110(3)\nis protected by\nArticle 122.\n\nArticle 122\nprohibits courts from\n\nexamining the validity of any proceedings in Parliament on the ground that\n\nthere was “any alleged irregularity of procedure”. The content of the\n\nexpression “procedure” referred to in the Article, is indicated in\nArticle 118\nof\n\nthe Constitution. The marginal note to\nArticle 118\nprovides for “Rules of\n\nprocedure”.\nArticle 118\nprovides as follows:\n\n“118. (1) Each House of Parliament may make rules for\nregulating, subject to the provisions of this Constitution,\nits procedure and the conduct of its business.\n(2) Until rules are made under clause (1), the rules of\n110 Ibid, at pages 76-77\nPART E\n\nprocedure and standing orders in force immediately before\nthe commencement of this Constitution with respect to the\nLegislature of the Dominion of India shall have effect in\nrelation to Parliament subject to such modifications and\nadaptations as may be made therein by the Chairman of the\nCouncil of States or the Speaker of the House of the People,\nas the case may be.\n\n(3) The President, after consultation with the Chairman of the\nCouncil of States and the Speaker of the House of the\nPeople, may make rules as to the procedure with respect to\njoint sittings of, and communications between, the two\nHouses.\n\n(4) At a joint sitting of the two Houses the Speaker of the\nHouse of the People, or in his absence such person as may\nbe determined by rules of procedure made under clause (3),\nshall preside.” (Emphasis supplied)\nArticles 118\nto 122 are covered under the rubric of the general heading-\n\n“Procedure Generally”.\nArticle 118\nprovides for rules to be made by each\n\nHouse of Parliament for regulating the procedure and conduct of its business.\n\nThe Article subjects these contemplated rules to the provisions of the\n\nConstitution. The provision does not indicate that these rules will stand above\n\nthe Constitution. They are, on the contrary, subject to the Constitution. The\n\nrules framed under\nArticle 118\n, are procedural in nature. The procedure\n\ncontemplated under\nArticles 118\nto 122 is distinct from substantive\n\nconstitutional requirements. The obligation placed on the Speaker of the Lok\n\nSabha to certify whether a Bill is a Money Bill is not a mere matter of\n\n“procedure” contemplated under\nArticle 122.\nIt is a constitutional requirement,\n\nwhich has to be fulfilled according to the norms set out in\nArticle 110.\n\nArticle\nwill not save the action of the Speaker, if it is contrary to constitutional\n\nnorms provided under\nArticle 110.\nThe Court, in the exercise of its power of\n\njudicial review, can adjudicate upon the validity of the action of the Speaker if\nPART E\n\nit causes constitutional infirmities.\nArticle 122\ndoes not envisage exemption\n\nfrom judicial review, if there has been a constitutional infirmity. The\n\nConstitution does not endorse a complete prohibition of judicial review under\n\nArticle 122.\nIt is only limited to an “irregularity of procedure”.\n\n78 This Court has on several occasions restricted the scope of the bar\n\nprovided under\nArticle 122 (\nand under corresponding\nArticle 212\nfor the\n\nStates) and has distinguished an “irregularity of procedure” from “illegality”. In\n\nSpecial Reference No. 1 of 1964111, a seven judge Bench of this Court\n\nbrought home that distinction in the context of\nArticle 212(1)\nwith the following\n\nobservations:\n\n“61…Article 212(2) confers immunity on the officers and\nmembers of the Legislature in whom powers are vested by or\nunder the Constitution for regulating procedure or the conduct\nof business, or for maintaining order, in the Legislature from\nbeing subject to the jurisdiction of any court in respect of the\nexercise by him of those powers.\nArt. 212(1)\nseems to make it\npossible for a citizen to call in question in the appropriate\ncourt of law the validity of any proceedings inside the\nlegislative chamber if his case is that the said proceedings\nsuffer not from mere irregularity of procedure, but from\nan illegality. If the impugned procedure is illegal and\nunconstitutional, it would be open to be scrutinised in a\ncourt of law, though such scrutiny is prohibited if the\ncomplaint against the procedure is no more than this that\nthe procedure was irregular...” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn Ramdas Athawale v Union of India112 (“Ramdas Athawale”), a\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court extended the above formulation to\nArticle 122\n\nof the Constitution:\n\n111 AIR 1965 SC 745\n112 (2010) 4 SCC 1\nPART E\n\n“36.This Court Under\nArticle 143\n, Constitution of India, In re\n(Special Reference No. 1 of 1964) [AIR 1965 SC 745 : (1965)\n1 SCR 413] (also known as Keshav Singh case [AIR 1965 SC\n745 : (1965) 1 SCR 413] ) while construing\nArticle 212(1)\n\nobserved that it may be possible for a citizen to call in\nquestion in the appropriate Court of law, the validity of any\nproceedings inside the Legislature if his case is that the said\nproceedings suffer not from mere irregularity of procedure,\nbut from an illegality. If the impugned procedure is illegal and\nunconstitutional, it would be open to be scrutinized in a Court\nof law, though such scrutiny is prohibited if the complaint\nagainst the procedure is no more than this that the procedure\nwas irregular. The same principle would equally be applicable\nin the matter of interpretation of\nArticle 122\nof the\nConstitution.”113\n\nA Constitution Bench of this Court reaffirmed the distinction between a\n\n“procedural irregularity” and an “illegality” in Raja Ram Pal v Hon'ble\n\nSpeaker, Lok Sabha114 (“Raja Ram Pal”). The Bench held that courts are\n\nnot prohibited from exercising their power of judicial review to examine any\n\nillegality or unconstitutionality in the procedure of Parliament:\n\n“386…Any attempt to read a limitation into\nArticle 122\nso as\nto restrict the court's jurisdiction to examination of the\nParliament's procedure in case of unconstitutionality, as\nopposed to illegality would amount to doing violence to the\nconstitutional text. Applying the principle of “expressio unius\nest exclusio alterius” (whatever has not been included has by\nimplication been excluded), it is plain and clear that\nprohibition against examination on the touchstone of\n\"irregularity of procedure\" does not make taboo judicial\nreview on findings of illegality or unconstitutionality…115\n\n398… the Court will decline to interfere if the grievance\nbrought before it is restricted to allegations of “irregularity of\nprocedure”. But in case gross illegality or violation of\nconstitutional provisions is shown, the judicial review will not\nbe inhibited in any manner by\nArticle 122\n, or for that matter by\nArticle 105.”116\n\n113 Ibid, at pages 13-14\n114 (2007) 3 SCC 184\n115 Ibid, at page 359\n116 Ibid, at page 362\nPART E\n\nThe Court distinguished the constitutional background in India from that of\n\nEngland, holding that while England has adopted a regime of exclusive\n\nparliamentary dominance, India is governed by a system of checks and\n\nbalances provided in the Constitution:\n\n“366.The touchstone upon which Parliamentary actions within\nthe four-walls of the Legislature were examined was both the\nconstitutional as well as substantive law. The proceedings\nwhich may be tainted on account of substantive illegality\nor unconstitutionality, as opposed to those suffering\nfrom mere irregularity thus cannot be held protected\nfrom judicial scrutiny by\nArticle 122(1)\nin as much as the\nbroad principle laid down in Bradlaugh [(1884) 12 QBD 271]\nacknowledging exclusive cognizance of the Legislature in\nEngland has no application to the system of governance\nprovided by our Constitution wherein no organ is\nsovereign and each organ is amenable to constitutional\nchecks and controls, in which scheme of things, this\nCourt is entrusted with the duty to be watchdog of and\nguarantor of the Constitution.”117 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe principle which emerges from these decisions is that the decision of the\n\nSpeaker is amenable to judicial review, if it suffers from illegality or from a\n\nviolation of constitutional provisions.\n\n79 The Attorney General advanced the submission that this Court has on\n\nprevious occasions refrained from scrutinizing the decision of the Speaker on\n\nwhether a Bill is a Money Bill. Those decisions require discussion for\n\nadjudicating the present case.\nIn\nMangalore Ganesh Beedi Works v State of\n\nMysore118 (“Mangalore Beedi”\n), a new system of coinage was introduced by\n\namending the Indian Coinage Act. Under the new system, while one rupee\n\n117 Ibid, at page 350\n118 1963 Supp (1) SCR 275\nPART E\n\nwas divided into a hundred naya paisas, the old legal tender of sixteen annas\n\nor sixty four pice remained legal tender equivalent to one hundred naya\n\npaisas. The appellant, which was a firm registered under the Mysore Sales\n\nTax Act, had to pay an additional amount as sales tax due to change in the\n\ncurrency. It was argued that by the substitution of 2 naya paisas (the new\n\ncurrency) in place of 3 pies (the old currency) as tax, there was a change in\n\nthe tax imposed by the Mysore Sales Tax Act, which could only have been\n\ndone by passing a Money Bill under\nArticles 198\n, 199\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution and since no Money Bill was introduced or passed for the\n\nenhancement of the tax, the tax was illegal and invalid. The contention,\n\ntherefore, was that the procedure envisaged for passing a Money Bill ought to\n\nhave been, but was not, followed. The Constitution Bench dismissed the\n\nappeal, holding that the substitution of a new coinage i.e. naya paisas in place\n\nof annas, pice and pies did not amount to an enhancement of tax. It was held\n\nto be merely a substitution of one coinage by another of equivalent value. This\n\nCourt held that the levy of tax in terms of naya paisas was not unconstitutional\n\nnor was it a taxing measure but it dealt merely with the conversion of the old\n\ncoinage into new coinage. Having held this, the Bench also remarked:\n\n“5…Even assuming that it is a taxing measure its validity\ncannot be challenged on the ground that it offends Arts. 197\nto 199 and the procedure\nlaid down in\n\nArt. 202\nof the\nConstitution.\nArticle 212\nprohibits the validity of any\nproceedings in a legislature of a State from being called in\nquestion on the ground of any alleged irregularity of\nprocedure and\nArt. 255\nlays down that requirements as to\nrecommendation and previous sanction are to be regarded as\nmatters of procedure only...”\nPART E\n\nThe Court having found that a substitution of coinage did not result in an\n\nenhancement of tax,\nArticle 199\nwas not attracted. The legislative measure\n\nwas not a Money Bill. Once that was the case, the subsequent observations\n\n(extracted above) proceeded on an assumption: that even if it were a taxing\n\nmeasure, it would be saved by\nArticle 255.\nThe court having held that no\n\nenhancement of tax was involved in a mere substitution of coinage, the\n\nalternative hypothesis is not a part of the ratio and was unnecessary. The ratio\n\nwas that substitution of a new coinage did not amount to a Money Bill. The\n\ndecision of the Constitution Bench in Mangalore Beedi dealt with the\n\ncontention that a Money Bill was unconstitutionally passed as an ordinary Bill.\n\nThe Bench held that substitution of coinage did not make it a Money Bill. The\n\ndecision contains a general observation regarding the immunity of\n\nproceedings in a state legislature. A scholarly article119 has correctly referred\n\nto the general remarks made in Mangalore Beedi as unnecessary and not the\n\nratio since the issue was already decided on merits, by holding that the\n\nsubstitution of coinage was not an enhancement of tax.\n\n80 A three judge Bench of this Court in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui v State of\n\nUttar Pradesh120 (“Mohd Saeed Siddiqui”) dealt with the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the Uttar Pradesh Lokayukta and Up-Lokayuktas (Amendment) Act,\n\n2012.\nSection 5(1)\nof the unamended Act provided a term of six years for the\n\nLokayukta.\nSection 5(3)\nprovided that on ceasing to hold office, the Lokayukta\n\n119 Pratik Datta, Shefali Malhotra & Shivangi Tyagi, Judicial Review and Money Bills, Vol 10, NUJS Law Review\n(2017).\n\n120 (2014) 11 SCC 415\nPART E\n\nor Up-Lokayukta shall be ineligible for further appointment. The new State\n\ngovernment, which came in office, introduced a Bill which was passed as the\n\nUttar Pradesh Lokayukta and Up-Lokayuktas (Amendment) Act, 2012, by\n\nwhich the term of the U.P. Lokayukta and Up-Lokayukta was extended from\n\nsix years to eight years or till the successor enters upon office. The\n\nAmendment Act also limited the ineligibility of the Lokayuktas or Up-\n\nLokayuktas for further appointment under the Government of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe Amendment Act was challenged on the ground that it was passed as a\n\nMoney Bill when, on the face of it, it could never have been called a Money\n\nBill under\nArticle 199\nof the Constitution. The Bench rejected the petition\n\nholding that the question “whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not can be raised\n\nonly in the State Legislative Assembly by a member thereof when the Bill is\n\npending in the State Legislature and before it becomes an Act”. It relied upon\n\nthe observations made in Mangalore Beedi, to formulate following principles:\n\n“(i) the validity of an Act cannot be challenged on the ground\nthat it offends\nArticles 197\nto 199 and the procedure laid\ndown in\nArticle 202; (ii)\n\nArticle 212\nprohibits the validity of any\nproceedings in a Legislature of a State from being called in\nquestion on the ground of any alleged irregularity of\nprocedure; and (iii)\nArticle 255\nlays down that the\nrequirements as to recommendation and previous sanction\nare to be regarded as a matter of procedure only. It is further\nheld that the validity of the proceedings inside the Legislature\nof a State cannot be called in question on the allegation that\nthe procedure laid down by the law has not been strictly\nfollowed and that no Court can go into those questions which\nare within the special jurisdiction of the Legislature itself,\nwhich has the power to conduct its own business.”\nPART E\n\nThe judgment also made a reference to the seven judge Bench decision in\n\nPandit MSM Sharma v Dr Shree Krishna Sinha121 (“MSM Sharma”).\n\nThe “proceedings of the Legislature” were held to include “everything said or\n\ndone in either House” in the transaction of parliamentary business. Relying\n\nupon\nArticles 212\nand\n, the Bench accorded finality to the decision of the\n\nSpeaker:\n\n“43. As discussed above, the decision of the Speaker of the\nLegislative Assembly that the Bill in question was a Money\nBill is final and the said decision cannot be disputed nor can\nthe procedure of the State Legislature be questioned by virtue\nof\nArticle 212.\nFurther, as noted earlier,\nArticle 255\nalso\nshows that under the Constitution the matters of procedure do\nnot render invalid an Act to which assent has been given to\nby the President or the Governor, as the case may be.\nInasmuch as the Bill in question was a Money Bill, the\ncontrary contention by the Petitioner against the passing of\nthe said Bill by the Legislative Assembly alone is\nunacceptable.”122\n\nMaking a passing reference to the decision of the Constitution Bench in Raja\n\nRam Pal, the Bench opined that even if it is established that there was some\n\ninfirmity in the procedure in the enactment of the Amendment Act, it will be\n\nprotected by\nArticle 255\nof the Constitution.\n\n81 Subsequently, a two judge Bench of this Court in Yogendra Kumar\n\nJaiswal v State of Bihar123 (“Yogendra Kumar”) dealt with the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the\nOrissa Special Courts Act, 2006\n. The law was enacted by the\n\n121 AIR 1960 SC 1186\n122 Mohd Saeed Siddiqui, Ibid, at page 430\n123 (2016) 3 SCC 183\nPART E\n\nState legislature, keeping in view the accumulation of properties\n\ndisproportionate to their known sources of income by persons who have held\n\nor hold high political and public offices. The legislature provided special courts\n\nfor speedy trial of certain classes of offences and for confiscation of\n\nproperties. The appellants, who were public servants and facing criminal\n\ncases, challenged the Act on the ground that it was introduced in the State\n\nAssembly as a Money Bill though it did not have any characteristics of a\n\nMoney Bill under\nArticle 199\nof the Constitution. The Court dismissed the\n\npetitions, following the decision in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui. It held that:\n\n“43.\nIn our considered opinion, the authorities cited by the\nlearned Counsel for the Appellants do not render much\nassistance, for the introduction of a bill, as has been held in\n\nMohd. Saeed Siddiqui\n(supra), comes within the concept of\n“irregularity” and it does come with the realm of substantiality.\n\nWhat has been held in the Special Reference No. 1 of 1964\n(supra) has to be appositely understood.\nThe factual matrix\ntherein was totally different than the case at hand as we find\nthat the present controversy is wholly covered by the\npronouncement in\nMohd. Saeed Siddiqui\n(supra) and hence,\nwe unhesitatingly hold that there is no merit in the submission\nso assiduously urged by the learned Counsel for the\nAppellants.”124\n\nSpecial Reference No. 1 of 1964 was distinguished in Yogendra Kumar.\n\nArticle 255\nprovides:\n\n“\nNo Act\nof Parliament or of the Legislature of a State, and no\nprovision in any such Act, shall be invalid by reason only that\nsome recommendation or previous sanction required by this\nConstitution was not given, if assent to that Act was given—\n\n(a) where the recommendation required was that of the\nGovernor, either by the Governor or by the President;\n\n(b) where the recommendation required was that of the\nRajpramukh, either by the Rajpramukh or by the President;\n\n124 Ibid, at page 229\nPART E\n\n(c) where the recommendation or previous sanction required\nwas that of the President, by the President.”\nArticle 255\nspeaks about a situation where a “recommendation or\n\nprevious sanction” is required to be given by the Governor, Rajpramukh or, as\n\nthe case may be, by the President. The absence of a recommendation or\n\nprevious sanction will not invalidate the law, where the Act has received the\n\nassent of the Governor or the President. Subsequent assent, in other words,\n\ncures the absence of recommendation or sanction.\nArticle 255\nis in no way\n\nrelated to the decision or certificate of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or of the\n\nState Legislative Assembly on whether a Bill is a Money Bill. Moreover,\nArticle\ndoes not apply to\nArticles 110\nfor the simple reason that the latter does\n\nnot embody either a previous sanction or recommendation.\nArticle 255\ndoes\n\nnot envisage superseding the role of the Upper House of Parliament or the\n\nState Legislature. Mohd Saeed Siddiqui proceeds on an erroneous\n\nunderstanding of\nArticle 255.\nMohd Saeed Siddiqui was followed in\n\nYogendra Kumar. These two judgments cite the same three articles —\n\nArticles 199,125 212,126 and 255, to refrain from questioning the conduct of the\n\nSpeaker, without noticing that\nArticle 255\ndoes not apply there.\n\nFurther, MSM Sharma, which was referred in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui was\n\ndiscussed in the Special Reference to hold that the validity of any\n\nproceedings in a legislative chamber can be questioned if such proceedings\n\n125 Corresponding provision for the Union is\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution.\n126 Corresponding provision for the Union is\nArticle 122\nof the Constitution.\nPART E\n\nsuffer from illegality. The consistent thread which emerges from the judgments\n\nin Special Reference, Ramdas Athawale and Raja Ram Pal is that the\n\nvalidity of proceedings in Parliament or a State Legislature can be subject to\n\njudicial review on the ground that there is an illegality or a constitutional\n\nviolation. Moreover, the judgment in Yogendra Kumar followed Mohd Saeed\n\nSiddiqui. Siddiqui was based on an erroneous understanding of Mangalore\n\nBeedi. The decision of the Speaker under\nArticles 110(3)\nand\n199(3)\nis not\n\nimmune from judicial review.\n\nThe three judge Bench decision in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui and the two judge\n\nBench decision in Yogendra Kumar are overruled.\n\n83 Barring judicial review of the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision would\n\nrender a certification of a Bill as a Money Bill immune from scrutiny, even\n\nwhere the Bill does not, objectively speaking, deal only with the provisions set\n\nout in\nArticle 110(1).\nThe decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha whether a\n\nBill is a Money Bill impacts directly upon the constitutional role which will be\n\ndischarged by the Rajya Sabha in relation to it. The Lok Sabha alone does not\n\nrepresent Parliament. The Indian Parliament is bicameral. The Constitution\n\nenvisages a special role for the Rajya Sabha. In order to truly understand the\n\nrelevance of the Rajya Sabha in the Indian context, an analysis of major\n\nbicameral systems is necessary, as an exercise in comparative law.\nPART E\n\n84 Bicameral legislatures are not unique to either the Presidential or\n\nParliamentary forms of government. Democracies with a Presidential form of\n\ngovernment have adopted bicameral legislatures, the United States being the\n\nleading example. Among Parliamentary democracies, India and the UK have\n\nadopted bicameral legislatures. They are predominant in federal countries.\n\nWhere second chambers exist, they vary in terms of powers and composition.\n\nTogether, their powers and composition shape the impact that they have on\n\nlegislation.127 The phenomenon of the bicameral system has two different\n\nhistoric origins. It was first established in England, and later in the US.128 Both\n\nthese models have been replicated across the globe.\n\n85 Britain developed some of the earliest institutional practices that came\n\nto be emulated through the Western world. A separate powerful legislature\n\nwas initiated when King John in 1215 gave a written commitment to seek the\n\nconsent of Parliament to levy taxes to which he was entitled by feudal\n\nprerogative. Over the next five centuries, the British Parliament was\n\ntransformed from an institution summoned at the desire of the ruler to one\n\nwhich met on regular occasions to develop policy inclinations independent of\n\nthe wishes of the ruler.129 In the fourteenth century, Parliament was divided\n\ninto two chambers: one chamber (the House of Lords) in which debate took\n\nplace with the feudal lords and a second chamber (the House of Commons)\n\n127 Fathali M. Moghaddam, The SAGE Encyclopaedia of Political Behaviour (2017).\n128 Betty Drexhage, Bicameral Legislatures: An International Comparison, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom\nRelations- Netherlands (2015), at page 7\n129 Abhinay Muthoo & Kenneth A. Shepsle, The Constitutional Choice of Bicameralism, in Institutions and\n\nEconomic Performance (Elhanan Helpman ed.), Harvard University Press (2008), at pages 251-252\nPART E\n\nwhere the citizens were represented.130 The upper chamber of the British\n\nParliament, the Lords, comprised of hereditary peers (whose number varied\n\nwith the discretion of the King to create them). The lower chamber, the\n\nCommons, represented individuals satisfying a substantial property\n\nrequirement. The two chambers in Britain reflected a kind of class division.\n\nBefore the beginning of the eighteenth century, several factors such as civil\n\nwar, regicide, experimentation with a republic, and the restoration of the titular\n\nmonarch caused power to be permanently shifted from the King to\n\nParliament.131\n\nAround the same time, the British colonies in North America were crafting\n\ninstitutions of their own. Colonial legislatures were being conceptualized on\n\nsimilar lines, with some exceptions, to British Parliament. The Constitution for\n\nthe newly formed United States adopted a bicameral system.132 The\n\nlegislature in the United States was innovative, for it created a bicameral\n\narrangement that replaced a class basis (as was in existence in Britain) for\n\nchamber representation with a modified federal basis. The Constitutional\n\nConvention of 1787 had provided for a lower chamber, a directly-elected\n\nHouse of Representatives, where each voter had an equal vote in elections,\n\nand an upper chamber, a Senate, to which each state could send two\n\nmembers, elected indirectly by the state parliaments. The Convention was a\n\n130 Betty Drexhage, Bicameral Legislatures: An International Comparison, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom\nRelations- Netherlands (2015), at page 7\n131 Abhinay Muthoo & Kenneth A.

A system with two differently composed chambers was ultimately\n\nchosen to be the only way out of the deadlock.133 The rationale for a\n\nbicameral legislature comprising of a directly elected Lower House and an\n\nindirectly elected Upper House was best articulated by James Madison, in the\n\nFederalist Papers:\n\n“First… a senate, as a second branch of the legislative\nassembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first,\nmust be in all cases a salutary check on the government. It\ndoubles the security to the people, by requiring the\nconcurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation\nor perfidy, where the ambition or corruption of one would\notherwise be sufficient…\nSecond. The necessity of a senate is not less indicated by the\npropensity of all single and numerous assemblies to yield to\nthe impulse of sudden and violent passions, and to be\nseduced by factious leaders into intemperate and pernicious\nresolutions…\nThird. Another defect to be supplied by a senate lies in a want\nof due acquaintance with the objects and principles of\nlegislation. It is not possible that an assembly of men called\nfor the most part from pursuits of a private nature, continued\nin appointment for a short time, and led by no permanent\nmotive to devote the intervals of public occupation to a study\nof the laws, the affairs, and the comprehensive interests of\ntheir country, should, if left wholly to themselves, escape a\nvariety of important errors in the exercise of their legislative\ntrust… A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to\nthe object of government, which is the happiness of the\npeople; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that\nobject can be best attained…\nFourth. The mutability in the public councils arising from a\nrapid succession of new members, however qualified they\n\n133Betty Drexhage, Bicameral Legislatures: An International Comparison, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom\nRelations- Netherlands (2015), at page 7\nPART E\n\nmay be, points out, in the strongest manner, the necessity of\nsome stable institution in the government…”134\n\nMadison conceptualized that the second chamber would fulfil significant roles:\n\n(a) it would provide the certainty that the government will not neglect its\n\nobligations to its constituents, as the chamber provides an extra check on it;\n\n(b) it can curb the actions of the other chamber if it gives into the urge to\n\nfollow ‘sudden and pronounced sentimental reactions’; (c) it can meet the\n\nneed for expertise in the framing of laws and the interests of the country, and\n\nthus help to avoid legislative mistakes; and (d) it can be a factor for stability\n\nthat ensures continuity in the administration of the country.\n\n86 Bicameralism, in both systems, emerged as a development associated\n\nwith the changing conceptions of the state. The literature on bicameralism has\n\nhighlighted the importance of having a second chamber in the legislature of a\n\nstate. William Riker has emphasized that a bicameral structure acts as a\n\ncontrol over the tyranny of a majority.135 Levmore similarly echoes this\n\nthought:\n\n“At the very least, if the two chambers consider an issue\nsimultaneously, one chamber’s agenda setter will be at the\nmercy of the order of consideration in the second chamber.\nBicameralism can thus be understood as an antidote to the\nmanipulative power of the convenor, or agenda setter, when\nfaced with cycling preferences.”136\n\n134 James Madison, The Federalist No. 62 – The Senate, The Federalist Papers (1788), available at\nhttp://www.constitution.org/fed/federa62.html\n135 William H. Riker, The Justification of Bicameralism, International Political Science Review (1992), Vol. 13,\n\nIssue 1, at pages 101–16.\n\n136 Saul Levmore, Bicameralism: When Are Two Decisions Better than One?, International Review of Law and\n\nEconomics (1992), Vol. 12, at pages 147-148.\nPART E\n\nA study137 commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom\n\nRelations analysed the design of the bicameral system in several countries.\n\nThe study consulted constitutional texts and literature on the evolution of\n\nbicameralism and came to the finding that:\n\n“Historically, the creation of bicameral systems, both in the\nfederal and the aristocratic variant, always was a concession\nto those (states or estates) who risked losing power in the\nnew setting. In emerging democracies, and up until the\npresent day, the choice of a bicameral system appears as a\nmeans of dispelling fear about the consequences of\ndemocratisation and reconciling established elites with the\ndemocratisation process. In developed democracies, the\nrationale of a bicameral system is now sought primarily in the\npossibility of combining different systems of representation\n(particularly in federal systems) and in the possibility of\nreconsideration by a different chamber in the legislative,\nmaking it possible to avoid making mistakes and enhancing\nboth the quality and the stability of the legislation. In majority\nsystems of the Westminster model - where the government is\npart of the lower house and it tends to have a stable majority -\na senate moreover is sometimes ascribed the role of giving\nmore independent input into the parliamentary work, less\ndetermined by party discipline, and of paying more attention\nto the interests of minorities. A bicameral system is, for that\nreason, sometimes recommended as a means to protect\nminorities against a tyranny of the majority… Finally, a\nbicameral system may also increase efficiency because it is\npossible to divide the legislative workload between two\nchambers. That can be the case when the two chambers\nabsorb a sort of division of labour (e.g. an emphasis on\ntechnical legal quality in the senate).

In this view, a second chamber\n\nmay enable a “more nuanced and complete representation of society, with\n\ngreater representation for territorial, communal or other minorities”.140\n\nWhile discussing the advantage of second chambers in republican\n\nlegislatures, Rogers observes that the institution of a second chamber\n\ngenerates legislative advantage only “if the chambers differ significantly from\n\none another”.141 Quoting from the work of various scholars, he observes:\n\n“Hammond and Miller find that “The stability-inducing\nproperties of bicameralism are . . . dependent on the\nexistence of distinctly different viewpoints in the two\nchambers”… Buchanan and Tullock conclude similarly that,\n“unless the bases for representation are significantly different\nin the two houses, there would seem to be little excuse for the\ntwo-house system”… Because two “congruent” chambers\nwould ostensibly not significantly affect policy outcomes,\nLijphart described bicameral systems with congruent\nchambers as “weak” forms of bicameralism…”142\n\n88 Bicameralism, when entrenched as a principle in a constitutional\n\ndemocracy, acts as a check against the abuse of power by constitutional\n\nmeans or its use in an oppressive manner.

Among its other roles is that of representing\n\nlocal state units, acting as a body of expert review, and providing\n\nrepresentation for diverse socio-economic interests or ethno-cultural\n\nminorities.\n\nWhile deliberating over the necessity of having a second chamber, the\n\nConstituent Assembly had the benefit of examining the constitutional history\n\nof several other nations. The constitutional advisor, B N Rau, found the issue\n\nof second chambers to be “one of the most vexing questions of political\n\nscience”.143 Under colonial rule, bicameralism had already been introduced.\n\nThe first bicameral legislature as the national assembly for India was\n\nestablished by the\nGovernment of India Act\n1919.\nThe Government of India\n\nAct, 1935\nhad created an Upper House in the federal legislature which\n\nconsisted of members elected by the provincial legislatures as well as\n\nrepresentatives sent by numerous princely states that were not under the\n\ndirect control of the British government. The 1935 Act became the blueprint\n\nfor the structure of Parliament in the new Constitution. The Rajya Sabha, as\n\nthe Upper House of the Parliament, was adopted into the Constitution. The\n\nvision of the Constitution makers behind the establishment of the Upper\n\nHouse of Parliament has found expression in the classic work of Granville\n\nAustin:\n\n143Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1966), at page\nPART E\n\n“The members of the Constituent Assembly had one\npredominant aim when framing the Legislative provisions of\nthe Constitution: to create a basis for the social and political\nunity of the country… The goals of the Constituent\nAssembly… were to bring popular opinion into the halls of\ngovernment, and, by the method of bringing it there, to show\nIndians that although they were many peoples, they were but\none nation.”144\nArticle 80\nof the Constitution deals with the composition of the Rajya\n\nSabha. The maximum strength of this chamber is 250 members, out of which\n\nup to 238 members are elected representatives from the states and union\n\nterritories. 12 members are nominated by the President among persons with\n\na special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art and\n\nsocial service. Members representing the states are elected by the state\n\nlegislatures through proportional representation by means of a single\n\ntransferable vote145. The method of electing representatives from Union\n\nterritories has been left to prescription by Parliament.146 In a departure from\n\nthe American model of equal representation for the states, the allocation of\n\nseats in the Rajya Sabha to the States and Union territories is in accordance\n\nwith the division provided in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution (read with\n\nArticles 4(1)\nand\n80(2)\n). The reason behind this division of seats is “to\n\nsafeguard the interests of the smaller states while at the same time ensuring\n\nthe adequate representation of the larger states, so that the will of the\n\nrepresentatives of a minority of the electorate does not prevail over that of\n\n144 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1966), at pages\n180 & 203\nArticle 80(4)\n, The Constitution of India\nArticle 80(5)\n, The Constitution of India\nPART E\n\nthose who represented the majority”147. In this sense, the Rajya Sabha has a\n\nspecial structure.\n\n90 The institutional structure of the Rajya Sabha has been developed to\n\nreflect the pluralism of the nation and its diversity of language, culture,\n\nperception and interest. The Rajya Sabha was envisaged by the makers of\n\nthe Constitution to ensure a wider scrutiny of legislative proposals. As a\n\nsecond chamber of Parliament, it acts as a check on hasty and ill-conceived\n\nlegislation, providing an opportunity for scrutiny of legislative business. The\n\nrole of the Rajya Sabha is intrinsic to ensuring executive accountability and to\n\npreserving a balance of power. The Upper Chamber complements the\n\nworking of the Lower Chamber in many ways. The Rajya Sabha acts as an\n\ninstitution of balance in relation to the Lok Sabha and represents the federal\n\nstructure148 of India.\nBoth the existence and the role of the Rajya Sabha\n\nconstitute a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The architecture of\n\nour Constitution envisions the Rajya Sabha as an institution of federal\n\nbicameralism and not just as a part of a simple bicameral legislature. Its\n\nnomenclature as the ‘Council of States’ rather than the ‘Senate’ appropriately\n\njustifies its federal importance.149 Seervai has observed that the federal\n\nprinciple is dominant in our Constitution. While adverting to several of its\n\n147 Sidharth Chauhan, Bicameralism: comparative insights and lessons, Seminar (February, 2013) available at\nhttp://india-seminar.com/2013/642/642_sidharth_chauhan.html\n148 In\nSR Bommai v Union of India\n(AIR 1994 SC 1998), a seven-judge Bench of this Court held: “Democracy and\n\nfederalism are the essential features of our Constitution and are part of its basic structure.”\n149 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\n\npage 2.

Shakdher, Practice and Procedure of Parliament, Lok Sabha Secretariat\n\n(2001)\nPART E\n\nfederal features, Seervai emphasises the position of the Rajya Sabha as an\n\nintegral element:\n\n“First and foremost, Parliament (the Central Legislature) is\ndependent upon the States, because one of its Houses, the\nCouncil of States, is elected by the Legislative Assemblies of\nthe States. Where the ruling party, or group of parties, in the\nHouse of the People has a majority but not an overwhelming\nmajority, the Council of States can have a very important\nvoice in the passage of legislation other than financial Bills.\nSecondly, a Bill to amend the Constitution requires to be\npassed by each House of Parliament separately by an\nabsolute majority in that House and by not less than two-\nthirds of those present and voting. Since the Council of States\nis indirectly elected by the State Legislatures, the State\nLegislatures have an important say in the amendment of the\nConstitution because of the requirement of special majorities\nin each House. Thirdly, the very important matters mentioned\nin the proviso to\nArticle 368 (Amendment of the Constitution)\n\ncannot be amended unless the amendments passed by\nParliament are ratified by not less than half the number of\nLegislatures of the States… Fourthly, the amendment of\n\nArticle 352\nby the 44th Amendment gives the Council of\nStates a most important voice in the declaration of\nEmergency, because a proclamation of emergency must be\napproved by each House separately by majorities required for\nan amendment of the Constitution… Fifthly, the executive\npower of the Union is vested in the President of India who is\nnot directly elected by the people but is elected by an\nelectoral college consisting of (a) the elected members of the\nLegislative Assemblies of the States and (b) the elected\nmembers of both Houses of Parliament… Directly the State\nLegislatures have substantial voting power in electing the\nPresident; that power is increased indirectly through the\nCouncil of States, which is elected by the Legislative\nAssemblies of States.”150\n\n91 The Rajya Sabha represents the constituent states of India. It\n\nlegitimately holds itself as the guardian of the interest of the component states\n\nin a federal polity. It endeavours to remain concerned and sensitive to the\n\naspirations of the states, thereby strengthening the country’s “federal fabric”\n\n150 H M Seervai, Constitutional Law of India, Universal Law Co.

Then, Parliament is empowered to make a law\non the subject specified in the resolution for the whole or any\npart of the territory of India. Such a resolution remains in force\nfor a maximum period of one year but this period can be\nextended by one year at a time by passing a further\nresolution;\n\n(ii) Under Article 312 of the Constitution, if Rajya Sabha\npasses a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of\nthe Members present and voting declaring that it is necessary\nor expedient in the national interest to create one or more All\nIndia Services common to the Union and the States,\nParliament has the power to create by law such services; and\n\n(iii) Under the Constitution, President is empowered to issue\nProclamations in the event of national emergency (Article\n\n352), in the event of failure of constitutional machinery in a\nState (\nArticle 356\n), or in the case of financial emergency\n(\nArticle 360\n). Normally, every such Proclamation has to be\napproved by both Houses of Parliament within a stipulated\nperiod. Under certain circumstances, however, Rajya Sabha\nenjoys special powers in this regard. If a Proclamation is\nissued at a time when the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes\nplace within the period allowed for its approval, then the\nProclamation can remain effective if a resolution approving it,\nis passed by Rajya Sabha.”\n\n92 The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body as it is not subject to\n\ndissolution.153 Being an indirectly elected House, it has no role in the making\n\nor unmaking of the Government and therefore it is comparatively “free from\n\n151 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\npage 6.\n\n152 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Structure and Functions of Rajya Sabha Secretariat, (2009), at pages 2-3\n153 Under\nArticle 83(1)\n, the Rajya Sabha is a permanent body with members being elected for 6 year terms and\n\none-third of the members retiring every 2 years.\nPART E\n\ncompulsions of competitive party politics”.154 As a revising chamber, the\n\nConstitution makers envisioned that it will protect the values of the\n\nConstitution, even if it is against the popular will. The Rajya Sabha is a symbol\n\nagainst majoritarianism.\n\nA Constitution Bench of this Court in\nKuldip Nayar v Union of India155\n\nhighlighted the importance of the Rajya Sabha:\n\n“47. The Rajya Sabha is a forum to which experienced public\nfigures get access without going through the din and bustle of\na general election which is inevitable in the case of Lok\nSabha.

As\na revising chamber, the Rajya Sabha helps in improving Bills\npassed by the Lok Sabha...”156\n\n93 Participatory governance is the essence of democracy. It ensures\n\nresponsiveness and transparency. An analysis of the Bills revised by the\n\nRajya Sabha reveals that in a number of cases, the changes recommended\n\nby the Rajya Sabha in the Bills passed by the Lok Sabha were eventually\n\ncarried out.157 The Dowry Prohibition Bill is an example of a legislation in\n\nwhich the Rajya Sabha’s insistence on amendments led to the convening of a\n\njoint sitting158 of the two Houses and in that sitting, one of the amendments\n\n154 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\npages 7-8\n155 (2006) 7 SCC 1\n156 Ibid, at page 47\n157 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\n\npage 5\n158 Dr Ambedkar explained that the joint sitting had been kept at the centre because of the federal character of\n\nthe Central Legislature.

The bicameral nature of Indian Parliament is integral to the\n\nworking of the federal Constitution. It lays down the foundations of our\n\ndemocracy. That it forms a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, is\n\nhence based on constitutional principle. The decision of the Speaker on\n\nwhether a Bill is a Money Bill is not a matter of procedure. It directly impacts\n\non the role of the Rajya Sabha and, therefore, on the working of the federal\n\npolity.\n\n94 There is a constitutional trust which attaches to the empowerment of\n\nthe Speaker of the Lok Sabha to decide whether a legislative measure is a\n\nMoney Bill. Entrustment of the authority to decide is founded on the\n\nexpectation that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha will not dilute the existence of\n\na co-ordinate institution in a bicameral legislature. A constitutional trust has\n\nbeen vested in the office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. By declaring an\n\nordinary Bill to be a Money Bill, the Speaker limits the role of the Rajya\n\nSabha. This power cannot be unbridled or bereft of judicial scrutiny. If the\n\npower of the Speaker is exercised contrary to constitutional norms, it will not\n\nonly limit the role of the Rajya Sabha, but denude the efficacy of a legislative\n\nbody created by the Constitution. Such an outcome would be inconsistent\n\n159 Rajya Sabha Secretariat, Second Chamber In Indian Parliament: Role and Status of Rajya Sabha, (2009), at\npage 5\nPART E\n\nwith the scheme of the Indian Constitution. Judicial review is necessary to\n\nensure that the federal features of the Constitution are not transgressed.\n\nE.2 Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill\n\nThis Court must now deal with whether the Aadhaar Act was validly passed as\n\na Money Bill.\nArticle 110(1)\nof the Constitution defines a Money Bill. For a Bill to be a\n\nMoney Bill, it must contain “only provisions” dealing with every or any one of\n\nthe matters set out in sub-clauses (a) to (g) of clause 1 of\nArticle 110.\nThe\n\nexpression “if it contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following\n\nmatters, namely...” is crucial. Firstly, the expression “if” indicates a condition\n\nand it is only upon the condition being fulfilled that the deeming fiction of a Bill\n\nbeing a Money Bill for the purposes of the Chapter will arise. Secondly, to be a\n\nMoney Bill, the Bill should have only those provisions which are referable to\n\nclauses (a) to (g). The condition is much more stringent than stipulating that\n\nthe Bill should incorporate any of the matters spelt out in clauses (a) to (g).\n\nThe words “only provisions” means that besides the matters in sub clauses (a)\n\nto (g), the Bill shall not include anything else. Otherwise, the expression “only”\n\nwill have no meaning. The word “only” cannot be treated to be otiose or\n\nredundant. Thirdly, the two expressions “if it contains only provisions” and\n\n“namely” indicate that sub-clauses (a) to (g) are exhaustive of what a Money\n\nBill may contain. The contents of a Money Bill have to be confined to all or any\nPART E\n\nof the matters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (g). Fourthly, sub-clause (g)\n\ncovers any matter incidental to sub-clauses (a) to (f). A matter is incidental\n\nwhen it is ancillary to what is already specified. Sub-clause (g) is not a\n\nresiduary entry which covers all other matters other than those specified in\n\nsub-clauses (a) to (f). If sub-clause (g) were read as a catch-all residuary\n\nprovision, it would defeat the purpose of defining a class of Bills as Money\n\nBills. What is incidental under sub-clause (g) is that which is ancillary to a\n\nmatter which is already specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f). The test is not\n\nwhether it is incidental to the content of a Bill but whether it is incidental to any\n\nof the matters specifically enumerated in sub-clauses (a) to (f). The Attorney\n\nGeneral would request the court to read the word “only” before “if” and not\n\nwhere it occurs. If the submission were to be accepted, it would lead to the\n\nconsequence that the Bill would be a Money Bill if it contained provisions\n\ndealing with clause (a) to (g), even if it contained other provisions not relatable\n\nto these clauses. We cannot rewrite the Constitution, particularly where it is\n\ncontrary to both text, context and intent.\n\nClause (2) of\nArticle 110\nprovides that a Bill shall not be deemed to be a\n\nMoney Bill just for the reason that it provides for the imposition of fines or\n\nother pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment of fees for licences or\n\nfees for services rendered, or by reason that it provides for the imposition,\n\nabolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or\n\nbody for local purposes. Like in the Parliament Act of 1911, the definition of a\nPART E\n\nMoney Bill provided under\nArticle 110(1)\nis exhaustive in nature. A Bill can be\n\na Money Bill if it contains “only provisions” dealing with all or any of the\n\nmatters listed under sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110(1).\n\n96 A Financial Bill is different from a Money Bill.\nArticle 117\nprovides for\n\nspecial provisions relating to Financial Bills. Clause (1) of\nArticle 117\nstates:\n\n“(1) A Bill or amendment making provision for any of the\nmatters specified in sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (1) of\n\narticle 110\nshall not be introduced or moved except on the\nrecommendation of the President and a Bill making such\nprovision shall not be introduced in the Council of States.”\n\nA Financial Bill does not need to have “only provisions” dealing with Sub-\n\nclauses (a) to (f) of\nArticle 110.\nThe provisions of\nArticle 110(1)\nare therefore\n\nnarrow and exhaustive.\n\n97 As a matter of interpretation, the use of the word “only” indicates that a\n\nparticular entry is exhaustive and is inapplicable to anything which falls\n\noutside its scope. This Court has interpreted the expression “only” as a word\n\nof exclusion and restriction.160 The interpretation of\nArticle 110(1)\nas being\n\nrestrictive in nature is also supported by the proceedings in the Constituent\n\nAssembly of India.\nArticle 110\ncorresponds to\nArticle 90\nof the Draft\n\nConstitution. On 20 May 1949, a member of the Constituent Assembly,\n\nGhanshyam Singh Gupta, proposed an amendment in clause (\n1) of\nArticle 90\n\n160Hari\nRam v. Baby Gokul Prasad\n, (1991) Supp (2) SCC 608; M/s\nSaru Smelting (P) Ltd. v. Commissioner of\nSales Tax, Lucknow\n, (1993) Supp (3) SCC 97.\nPART E\n\nto delete the word “only”. He stated that a Bill can be a Money bill even while\n\ncontaining other provisions. Gupta argued:\n\n“This article is a prototype of\nSection 37\nof the Government of\nIndia Act which says that a Bill or amendment providing for\nimposing or increasing a tax or borrowing money, etc. shall\nnot be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of\nthe Governor-General. This means that the whole Bill need\nnot be a money Bill: it may contain other provisions, but if\nthere is any provision about taxation or borrowing, etc. It will\ncome under this\nSection 37\n, and the recommendation of the\nGovernor-General is necessary. Now\narticle 90\nsays that a\nBill shall be deemed to be a money Bill if it contains only\nprovisions dealing with the imposition, regulation, etc., of\nany tax or the borrowing of money, etc. This can mean\nthat if there is a Bill which has other provisions and also\na provision about taxation or borrowing etc., it will not\nbecome a money Bill. If that is the intention I have\nnothing to say; but that if that is not the intention I must\nsay the word \"only\" is dangerous, because if the Bill\ndoes all these things and at the same time does\nsomething else also it will not be a money Bill. I do not\nknow what the intention of the Drafting Committee is but I\nthink this aspect of the article should be borne in mind.”161\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nAnother member Naziruddin Ahmad also emphasized on the deletion of the\n\nword “only”. The concern of these two members was that the word “only”\n\nrestricts the scope of a Bill being passed as a Money Bill. Their apprehension\n\nwas that if a Bill has other provisions which are unrelated to the clauses\n\nmentioned in draft\nArticle 90\n, the Bill would not qualify to be a Money Bill in\n\nview of the word “only”. The amendment suggested by these members was\n\nlisted to be put to vote on a later date. The amendment was rejected when it\n\nwas put to vote on 8 June 1949. The framers of the Indian Constitution\n\nconsciously rejected the said amendment.\n\n161 Constituent Assembly Debates (20 May 1949)\nPART E\n\n98 When a Bill is listed as a Money Bill, it takes away the power of the\n\nRajya Sabha to reject or amend the Bill. The Rajya Sabha can only make\n\nsuggestions to a Money Bill, which are not binding on the Lok Sabha. The\n\nConstitution makers would have been aware about the repercussions of a Bill\n\nbeing introduced as a Money Bill. As the role of the Rajya Sabha is limited in\n\nthe context of Money Bills, the scope of what constitutes a Money Bill was\n\nrestricted by adopting the word “only” in Draft\nArticle 90.\nA Bill to be a Money\n\nBill must not contain any provision which falls outside clauses (a) to (g) of\n\nArticle 110(1).\nThe Constitution has carefully used the expression “dealing\n\nwith” in\nArticle 110 (1)\nand not the wider legislative form “related to”. A Bill,\n\nwhich has both − certain provisions which fall within sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\n\nArticle 110(1)\nand other provisions which fall outside will not qualify to be a\n\nMoney Bill. It is for this reason that there cannot also be any issue of the\n\nseverability of the provisions of a Bill, which has certain provisions relating to\n\nsub-clauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110(1)\n, while also containing provisions which\n\nfall beyond. Any other interpretation would result in rewriting the Constitution.\n\nIf a Bill contains provisions which fall outside sub-clauses (a) to (g), it is not a\n\nMoney Bill. The Rajya Sabha is entitled as part of its constitutional function to\n\nlegislative participation. The entirety of the Bill cannot be regarded as a Money\n\nBill, once it contains any matters which fall beyond sub-clauses (a) to (g).\n\nOnce that is the position, it could be impossible to sever those parts which fall\n\nwithin sub-clauses (a) to (g) and those that lie outside.\nThe presence of\n\nmatters which travel beyond sub-clauses (a) to (g) has consequences in terms\nPART E\n\nof the nature of the Bill and the legislative participation of the Rajya Sabha. If\n\nthe constitutional function of the Rajya Sabha has been denuded on the\n\nhypothesis that this Bill was a Money Bill, the consequence of a finding in\n\njudicial review that the Bill is not a Money Bill must follow. Any other\n\nconstruction will reduce bicameralism to an illusion.\n\nThis interpretation is also supported by the judgment of a Bench of seven\n\njudges of this Court in\nKrishna Kumar Singh v State of Bihar162\n, where it\n\nheld that the ordinance making power conferred upon the President and the\n\nGovernors is limited by the requirements set out by\nArticles 123\nand\n213.\nThis\n\nCourt had held:\n\n“59…The constitutional conferment of a power to frame\nordinances is in deviation of the normal mode of legislation\nwhich takes place through the elected bodies comprising of\nParliament and the state legislatures. Such a deviation is\npermitted by the Constitution to enable the President and\nGovernors to enact ordinances which have the force and\neffect of law simply because of the existence of\ncircumstances which can brook no delay in the formulation of\nlegislation. In a parliamentary democracy, the government is\nresponsible collectively to the elected legislature. The\nsubsistence of a government depends on the continued\nconfidence of the legislature. The ordinance making power\nis subject to the control of the legislature over the\nexecutive. The accountability of the executive to the\nlegislature is symbolised by the manner in which the\nConstitution has subjected the ordinance making power\nto legislative authority. This, the Constitution achieves by\nthe requirements of\nArticle 213...\n”163 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n99 The authority of the Lok Sabha to pass a Money Bill is based on the\n\nrequirements set out under\nArticle 110.\nThe framers of the Indian Constitution\n\n162 (2017) 3 SCC 1\n163 Ibid, at page 61\nPART E\n\ndeliberately restricted the scope of\nArticle 110(1)\nto ensure that the provision\n\nis not an avenue to supersede the authority of the Rajya Sabha. The intention\n\nof the Constitution makers is clear. The Lok Sabha cannot introduce and pass\n\na legislative measure in the garb of a Money Bill, which could otherwise have\n\nbeen amended or rejected by the Rajya Sabha. Bicameralism is a founding\n\nvalue of our democracy. It is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\nIntroduction and passing of a Bill as a Money Bill, which does not qualify to be\n\na Money Bill under\nArticle 110(1)\nof the Constitution, is plainly\n\nunconstitutional. The Lok Sabha is not entrusted with the entire authority of\n\nParliament. The Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha and the President together\n\nconstitute the Parliament of India. The Lok Sabha is a body of elected\n\nrepresentatives and represents the aspirations of citizens. Yet, like every\n\nconstitutional institution, it is part of this basic structure of the Constitution. A\n\npolitical party or a coalition which holds the majority in the Lok Sabha cannot\n\nsubvert the working of the Constitution, against which Dr B R Ambedkar had\n\nwarned164 in the Constituent Assembly. A ruling government has to work\n\nwithin constitutional parameters and has to abide by constitutional morality.\n\n100 The Constitution of India is not a mere parchment of paper. It was\n\nwritten with the vision of those who gave blood and sweat to freedom: political\n\npersonalities, social reformers and constitution framers. It symbolises a faith in\n\ninstitutions, justice and good governance. That vision cannot be belied. The\n\n164 Constituent Assembly Debates (4 November, 1948). Dr Ambedkar had remarked: “… it is perfectly possible to\npervert the Constitution, without changing its form by merely changing the form of the administration and to\nmake it inconsistent and opposed to the spirit of the Constitution.”\nPART E\n\nSpeaker of the Lok Sabha has an onerous constitutional duty to ensure that a\n\nBill, which is not a Money Bill is not passed as a Money Bill. The Speaker of\n\nthe Lok Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the members of the Lok\n\nSabha and the Rajya Sabha, and the President need to work in constitutional\n\nsolidarity to ensure that no provision of the Constitution is diluted or subverted.\n\n101 The Aadhaar Act was passed as a Money Bill. The provisions of the Act\n\nneed to be analysed to determine whether the Act is a Money Bill.\n\nThe Preamble of the Act states that it is:\n\n“\nAn Act\nto provide for, as a good governance, efficient,\ntransparent, and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and\nservices, the expenditure for which is incurred from the\nConsolidated Fund of India, to individuals residing in India\nthrough assigning of unique identity numbers to such\nindividuals and for matters connected therewith or incidental\nthereto.”\n\nThe Preamble focuses on the delivery of subsidies, benefits and services for\n\nwhich the expenditure is borne from the Consolidated Fund of India. But the\n\nessential issue is whether the Act confines itself to matters which fall within\n\nthe ambit of\nArticle 110.\nSection 3\nentitles every resident165 in India to obtain an Aadhaar\n\nnumber by submitting his or her demographic information, by undergoing the\n\nprocess of enrolment.\nSection 2(m)\ndefines “enrolment” as the process to\nSection 2(v)\nprovides: “resident” means an individual who has resided in India for a period or periods\namounting in all to one hundred and eighty-two days or more in the twelve months immediately preceding\nthe date of application for enrolment.\nPART E\n\ncollect demographic and biometric information from individuals by the enrolling\n\nagencies for the purpose of issuing Aadhaar numbers to such individuals.\n\nAfter receiving the demographic and biometric information of the individual,\n\nthe Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) would verify the information\n\nand shall issue an Aadhaar number to such an individual.166\nSection 4(3)\n\nprovides that the Aadhaar number may be accepted as proof of identity for\n\n“any purpose”.\nSection 5\nrequires UIDAI to take special measures to issue\n\nAadhaar numbers to “women, children, senior citizens, persons with disability,\n\nunskilled and unorganised workers, nomadic tribes or to such other persons\n\nwho do not have any permanent dwelling house and such other categories of\n\nindividuals”. Under\nSection 6\n, UIDAI may require Aadhaar number holders to\n\nupdate their demographic information and biometric information, from time to\n\ntime so as to ensure continued accuracy of their information in the Central\n\nIdentities Data Repository (“CIDR”). The Aadhaar Act defines CIDR as a\n\ncentralised database containing all Aadhaar numbers issued to Aadhaar\n\nnumber holders along with the corresponding demographic information and\n\nbiometric information of such individuals and other related information.167\nSection 7\nrequires proof of an Aadhaar number as a necessary\n\ncondition to avail subsidies, benefits and services, for which the expenditure is\n\nborne from the Consolidated Fund of India. The proviso to\nSection 7\nstates\n\nthat if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to an individual, the individual shall\n\n166 Section 3(3), Aadhaar Act\n167 Section 2(h), Aadhaar Act\nPART E\n\nbe offered alternate and viable means of identification for delivery of the\n\nsubsidy, benefit or service.\nSection 8(1)\nrequires UIDAI to perform\n\nauthentication168 of the Aadhaar number of an Aadhaar number holder, in\n\nrelation to his or her biometric information or demographic information\n\nsubmitted by any requesting entity169. Under\nSection 8(2)\n, a requesting entity\n\nis required to obtain the consent of an individual before collecting his or her\n\nidentity information for the purposes of authentication. The requesting entity\n\nmust ensure that the identity information of an individual collected by it is only\n\nused for submission to the CIDR for authentication.\nSection 8(3)\nrequires a\n\nrequesting entity to inform the individual submitting identity information for\n\nauthentication certain details with respect to authentication.\nChapter IV of the Act\ndeals with UIDAI.\nSection 11\nestablishes UIDAI as\n\nthe body responsible for the processes of enrolment and authentication and\n\nfor performing functions assigned to it under the Act.\nThe Act\nprovides for the\n\ncomposition of UIDAI170, qualifications of its members171, terms of office172 of\n\nits chairperson and members, their removal173 and functions174. Section 23,\n\nwhich deals with the powers and functions of UIDAI, authorizes it to develop\n\nthe policy, procedure and systems for issuing Aadhaar numbers to individuals\n\n168 Section 2(c) provides: “authentication” means the process by which the Aadhaar number alongwith\ndemographic information or biometric information of an individual is submitted to the Central Identities Data\nRepository for its verification and such Repository verifies the correctness, or the lack thereof, on the basis of\ninformation available with it.\nSection 2 (u)\nprovides: “requesting entity” means an agency or person that submits the Aadhaar number, and\n\ndemographic information or biometric information, of an individual to the Central Identities Data Repository for\nauthentication\n170 Section 12, Aadhaar Act\n171 Section 13, Aadhaar Act\n172 Section 14, Aadhaar Act\n173 Section 15, Aadhaar Act\n174 Section 17, Aadhaar Act\nPART E\n\nand to perform authentication.\nSection 23(h)\nstates that UIDAI has the power\n\nto specify the “manner of use of Aadhaar numbers” for the purposes of\n\nproviding or availing of various subsidies, benefits, services and “other\n\npurposes” for which Aadhaar numbers may be used. Under\nSection 23(3)\n,\n\nUIDAI may enter into a Memorandum of Understanding or agreement with the\n\nCentral Government or State Governments or Union territories or other\n\nagencies for the purpose of performing any of the functions in relation to\n\ncollecting, storing, securing or processing of information or delivery of\n\nAadhaar numbers to individuals or performing authentication.\n\n105 Chapter V deals with grants, accounts and audit and annual reports of\n\nUIDAI.\nSection 25\nprovides that the fees or revenue collected by UIDAI shall\n\nbe credited to the Consolidated Fund of India. Chapter VI deals with protection\n\nof information collected from individuals for authentication.\nSection 28(3)\n\nrequires UIDAI to take all necessary measures to ensure that the information\n\nin its possession or control, including information stored in the CIDR, is\n\nsecured and protected against access, use or disclosure (not permitted under\n\nthe Act or the regulations), and against accidental or intentional destruction,\n\nloss or damage.\nSection 29\nimposes restrictions on sharing of core biometric\n\ninformation, collected or created under the Act.\nSection 32(2)\nentitles every\n\nAadhaar number holder to obtain his or her authentication record in such\n\nmanner as may be specified by regulations.\nSection 33\nprovides for disclosure\n\nof information pursuant to a court order or in the interest of national security.\nPART E\nChapter VII of the Act\n(\nSections 34\nto\n) provides for offences and\n\npenalties.\nSection 34\nprovides for penalty for impersonation at the time of\n\nenrolment.\nSection 35\nprovides a penalty for impersonation of an Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder by changing demographic or biometric information. Under\n\nSection 37\n, a penalty for disclosing identity information (which was collected in\n\nthe course of enrolment or authentication) is provided.\nSection 38\nprovides a\n\npenalty for unauthorised access to the CIDR.\nSection 39\nimposes a penalty for\n\ntampering with data in the CIDR. Under\nSections 40\nand\n, a penalty has\n\nbeen provided for requesting entities and enrolment agencies, in case they act\n\nin contravention of the obligations imposed upon them under the Act.\nSection\nindicates that the provisions of the Act would apply to any offence or\n\ncontravention committed outside India by any person, irrespective of\n\nnationality.\nSection 48\nempowers the Central Government to supersede UIDAI in\n\ncertain situations.\nSection 50\nstates that UIDAI is bound by directions on\n\nquestions of policy given by the Central Government.\nSection 51\nauthorizes\n\nthe UIDAI to delegate to any member, officer of the Authority or any other\n\nperson, such of its powers and functions (except the power under\nsection 54\n)\n\nas it may deem necessary.\nSection 53\nempowers the Central Government to\n\nmake rules to carry out the provisions of the Act. Under\nSection 54(2)(m)\n,\n\nUIDAI can make regulations providing the manner of use of Aadhaar numbers\n\nfor the purposes of providing or availing of various subsidies, benefits,\nPART E\n\nservices and “other purposes” for which Aadhaar numbers may be used.\n\nSection 57\nauthorizes the State or any body corporate or person to use an\n\nAadhaar number for establishing the identity of an individual “for any purpose”,\n\nsubject to the procedure and obligations under\nSection 8\nand\nChapter VI of\n\nthe Act\n.\nSection 59\nseeks to validate the actions taken by the Central\n\nGovernment pursuant to the notifications dated 28 January 2009 and 12\n\nSeptember 2015, and prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act.\n\nThis broad description of the provisions of the Aadhaar Act indicates that the\n\nAct creates a framework for obtaining a unique identity number - the Aadhaar\n\nnumber - by submitting demographic and biometric information and\n\nundergoing the process of enrolment and authentication.\nThe Act\nindicates\n\nthat the Aadhaar number may be accepted as proof of identity for any\n\npurpose.\nThe Act\n, in other words, creates a platform for one pan-India and\n\nnationally acceptable identity. It creates a central database (CIDR) for storage\n\nof identity information collected from individuals.\nSections 3\nto\nspecifically\n\ndeal with the process of enrolment.\nSection 3\nentitles every resident to hold\n\nan Aadhaar number.\nSection 4(3)\nstates that the Aadhaar number so\n\ngenerated may be used as a proof of identity “for any purpose”. The primary\n\nobject of the legislation is to create one national identity for every resident. It\n\nseeks to do so by legislating a process for collecting demographic and\n\nbiometric information.\nThe Act\nhas created an authority to oversee the\n\nfulfilment of its provisions. In its primary focus and initiatives, the law traverses\nPART E\n\nbeyond the territory reserved by\nArticle 110\nfor a Money Bill.\nSections 7\nto\ndeal with authentication of information submitted at the time of enrolment.\n\nSection 8\ncreates obligations on requesting entities to ensure that consent\n\nis obtained from individuals before collecting their identity information and\n\nthat the identity information of such individual is only used for submission to\n\nthe CIDR for authentication.\nSections 11\nto\ncreate a statutory authority\n\n(UIDAI) and assign responsibilities to it for the processes of enrolment and\n\nauthentication and to discharge other functions assigned to it under the Act,\n\nincluding developing the policy, procedure and systems for issuing Aadhaar\n\nnumbers to individuals.\nSection 23(2)(h)\nprovides that apart from availing of\n\nvarious subsidies, benefits, and services, Aadhaar numbers may be used for\n\n“other purposes”.\nSections 28\nto\ndeal with protection of information, and\n\nprovide for security and confidentiality of identity information and restrictions\n\non sharing of information.\nSection 28\nimposes obligations on the UIDAI to\n\nensure the security and confidentiality of identity information and\n\nauthentication records of individuals, which are in its possession or control,\n\nincluding information stored in CIDR. Disclosure of identity information and\n\nauthentication records can be made under\nSection 33\n, pursuant to a court\n\norder (not below the rank of District Judge) or in the interest of national\n\nsecurity in pursuance of a direction of an officer (not below the rank of Joint\n\nSecretary to the Government of India).\nSections 34\nto\ndeal with substantive\n\noffences and penalties created under the Act.\nSections 54(2)(m)\nstates that\n\nregulations can be made by UIDAI specifying the manner of use of Aadhaar\nPART E\n\nnumbers for the purposes of providing or availing of various subsidies,\n\nbenefits, services and “other purposes” for which Aadhaar numbers may be\n\nused.\nSection 57\nauthorizes the use of Aadhaar number by anyone (whether\n\nby the State or any body corporate or person under law or contract) for\n\nestablishing the identity of an individual “for any purpose”.\nSection 7\nmakes the use of the Aadhaar number mandatory for availing\n\nsubsidies, benefits or services, for which expenditure is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India. The scheme of the Act deals with several aspects\n\nrelating to the unique identity number. The unique identity is capable of being\n\nused for multiple purposes: availing benefits, subsidies and services, for\n\nwhich expenses are incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, is just one\n\npurpose, among others. The Preamble to the Aadhaar Act indicates that the\n\nmain objective was to achieve an efficient and “targeted delivery of subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services, the expenditure for which is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India”. The substantive provisions of the Act are,\n\nhowever, not confined to the object specified in the Preamble. Indeed, they\n\ntravel far beyond the boundaries of a money bill under\nArticle 110(1).\nThe\n\nenrolment on the basis of demographic and biometric information, generation\n\nof Aadhaar number, obtaining consent of individuals before collecting their\n\nindividual information, creation of a statutory authority to implement and\n\nsupervise the process, protection of information collected during the process,\n\ndisclosure of information in certain circumstances, creation of offences and\nPART E\n\npenalties for disclosure or loss of information, and the use of the Aadhaar\n\nnumber for any purpose lie outside the ambit of\nArticle 110.\nThese themes are\n\nalso not incidental to any of the matters covered by sub-clauses (a) to (f) of\n\nArticle 110(1).\nThe provisions of\nSection 57\nwhich allow the use of an Aadhaar\n\nnumber by bodies corporate or private parties for any purpose do not fall\n\nwithin the ambit of\nArticle 110.\nThe legal framework of the Aadhaar Act\n\ncreates substantive obligations and liabilities which have the capability of\n\nimpacting on the fundamental rights of residents.\n\n109 A Bill, to be a Money Bill, must contain only provisions which fall within\n\nthe ambit of the matters mentioned in\nArticle 110.\n\nSection 7\nof the Act allows\n\nthe Aadhaar number to be made mandatory for availing of services, benefits\n\nand subsidies for which expenditure is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of\n\nIndia. Under clause (e) of\nArticle 110(1)\nthe money bill must deal with the\n\ndeclaring of any expenditure to be expenditure charged on the Consolidated\n\nFund of India (or increasing the amount of expenditure). Significantly,\nSection\ndoes not declare the expenditure incurred on services, benefits or subsidies\n\nto be a charge on the Consolidated Fund of India. What\nSection 7\ndoes is to\n\nenact a provision allowing for Aadhaar to be made mandatory, in the case of\n\nservices, benefits or subsidies which are charged to the Consolidated Fund.\n\nSection 7\ndoes not declare them to be a charge on the Consolidated Fund. It\n\nprovides that in the case of services, benefits or subsidies which are already\n\ncharged to the Consolidated Fund, Aadhaar can be made mandatory to avail\nPART E\n\nof them.\nSection 7\n, in other words, is a provision for imposing a requirement of\n\nauthentication and not declaring any expenditure to be a charge on the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India. Hence, even\nSection 7\nis not within the ambit of\n\nArticle 110(1)(e).\nHowever, even if\nSection 7\nwere to be held to be referable to\n\nArticle 110\n, that does not apply to the other provisions of the Act. The other\n\nprovisions of the Act do not in any event fall within the ambit of\nArticle 110(1).\n\nIntroducing one provision –\nSection 7\n– does not render the entirety of the Act\n\na Money Bill where its other provisions travel beyond the parameters set out in\n\nArticle 110.\n\nSection 57\nof the Act in particular (which creates a platform for the\n\nuse of the Aadhaar number by the private entities) can by no stretch of logic\n\nbe covered under\nArticle 110(1).\nThe other provisions of the Act do not deal\n\nwith that which has been provided under Sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110.\n\nAs regards the ‘incidental’ provision under\nArticle 110(1)(g)\n, the provisions of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act are not “incidental to any of the matters specified in sub-\n\nclauses (a) to (f)”. Even if it is assumed that there is one provision (\nSection 7\n)\n\nwhich is relatable to sub-clause (e) of\nArticle 110(1)\n, the other provisions of\n\nthe Act are unrelated to\nArticle 110(1).\n\n110 This Court must also advert to the legislative history prior to the\n\nenactment of the Aadhaar Act. An attempt to provide a legislative framework\n\ngoverning the Aadhaar project was first made by introducing the National\n\nIdentification Authority of India Bill, 2010 (“NIA Bill”). The NIA Bill was\nPART E\n\nintroduced in the Rajya Sabha on 3 December 2010. The Preamble of the Bill\n\nindicated its purpose:\n\n“A Bill to provide for the establishment of the National\nIdentification Authority of India for the purpose of issuing\nidentification numbers to individuals residing in India and to\ncertain other classes of individuals and manner of\nauthentication of such individuals to facilitate access to\nbenefits and services to such individuals to which they are\nentitled and for matters connected therewith or incidental\nthereto.”\n\nThe main objective of the Bill was to establish the National Identification\n\nAuthority of India to issue unique identification numbers (called ‘Aadhaar’) to\n\nresidents of India and to any other category of people for the purpose of\n\nfacilitating access to benefits and services. Chapter II (Clauses 3 to 10) of the\n\nBill dealt with Aadhaar numbers. Clause 3 of the Bill entitled every resident to\n\nobtain an Aadhaar number on providing demographic and biometric\n\ninformation to the Authority in such manner as may be specified. Clause 4(3)\n\nstated that an Aadhaar number shall be accepted, subject to authentication,\n\nas proof of identity of the Aadhaar number holder. Chapter III (Clauses 11 to\n\n23) dealt with the National Identification Authority of India. Clause 11 provided\n\nfor establishment of the Authority by the Central Government. Clause 23\n\nempowered the Authority to develop the policy, procedure and systems for\n\nissuing Aadhaar numbers to residents and to perform authentication. Clause\n\n23(2)(h) stated that the Authority may specify the usage and applicability of\n\nthe Aadhaar number for delivery of various benefits and services.\n\nEstablishing, operating and maintaining of the Central Identities Data\n\nRepository (CIDR) by the Authority was provided under Clause 23(2)(j).\nPART E\n\nChapter IV (Clauses 24 to 27) provide for grants, accounts and audit and\n\nannual reports related to the Authority. Clause 25 stated that the fees or\n\nrevenue collected by the Authority shall be credited to the Consolidated Fund\n\nof India and the entire amount would be transferred to the Authority. Chapter\n\nV (Clauses 28 and 29) dealt with creation of an Identity Review Committee\n\nand its functions. The functions of the Review Committee included\n\nascertaining the extent and pattern of usage of Aadhaar numbers across the\n\ncountry and preparing a report annually along with recommendations. Chapter\n\nVI (Clauses 30 to 33) dealt with the protection of individual identity information\n\nand authentication records. Clause 30(1) required the Authority to ensure the\n\nsecurity and confidentiality of identity information and authentication records of\n\nindividuals. Clause 30(2) required the Authority to take measures (including\n\nsecurity safeguards) to ensure that the information in the possession or\n\ncontrol of the Authority (including information stored in the Central Identities\n\nData Repository) is secured and protected against any loss or unauthorised\n\naccess or use or unauthorised disclosure. Clause 33 stated that individual\n\ninformation may be disclosed pursuant a court order or in the interest of\n\nnational security. Chapter VII (Clauses 34 to 46) created offences and\n\npenalties under the law. Clause 47 empowered the Central Government to\n\nsupersede the Authority. Clause 50 authorized the Authority to delegate to any\n\nMember, officer of the Authority or any other person such of its powers and\n\nfunctions (except the power under Clause 53). Clause 57 sought to validate\nPART E\n\nactions taken by the Central Government under the Planning Commission’s\n\nnotification of 2009.\n\n111 Since the UID programme involved complex issues, the NIA Bill was\n\nreferred, on 10 December 2010, to the Standing Committee on Finance,\n\nchaired by Mr Yashwant Sinha, for examination and report. The Standing\n\nCommittee comprised of 21 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 members\n\nfrom the Rajya Sabha. The Standing Committee submitted its Report175 on 11\n\nDecember 2011. The Report raised several objections to the Bill, which\n\nincluded those summarised below:\n\n(i) Since law making was underway, the bill being pending, any executive\n\naction is as violative of Parliament’s prerogatives as promulgation of an\n\nordinance while one of the Houses of Parliament is in session;\n\n(ii) While the country is facing a serious problem of illegal immigrants and\n\ninfiltration from across the borders, the National Identification Authority of\n\nIndia Bill, 2010 proposes to entitle every resident to obtain an Aadhaar\n\nnumber, apart from entitling such other category of individuals as may be\n\nnotified from time to time. This will, it is apprehended, make even illegal\n\nimmigrants entitled for an Aadhaar number;\n\n(iii) The issue of a unique identification number to individuals residing in India\n\nand other classes of individuals under the Unique Identification (UID)\n\n175Forty-Second Report, Standing Committee on Finance (2011-12), available at\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/uid%20report.pdf\nPART E\n\nScheme is riddled with serious lacunae and concern areas. For example,\n\nthe full or near full coverage of marginalized sections for issuing Aadhaar\n\nnumbers could not be achieved mainly due to two reasons viz. (a) the\n\nUIDAI doesn’t have the statistical data relating to them; and (b) estimated\n\nfailure of biometrics is expected to be as high as 15% because a large\n\nchunk of population is dependent on manual labour;\n\n(iv) Despite the presence of serious differences of opinion within the\n\nGovernment on the UID scheme, the scheme continues to be\n\nimplemented in an overbearing manner without regard to legalities and\n\nother social consequences;\n\n(v) The UID scheme lacks clarity on many issues including even the basic\n\npurpose of issuing an “Aadhaar” number. Although the scheme claims\n\nthat obtaining an Aadhaar number is voluntary, an apprehension has\n\ndeveloped in the minds of people that in future, services / benefits\n\nincluding food entitlements would be denied in case they do not an have\n\nan Aadhaar number;\n\n(vi) It is also not clear as to whether possession of an Aadhaar number would\n\nbe made mandatory in future for availing of benefits and services. Even if\n\nthe Aadhaar number links entitlements to targeted beneficiaries, it may\n\nnot ensure that beneficiaries have been correctly identified. Thus, the\n\npresent problem of proper identification would persist;\nPART E\n\n(vii) Though there are significant differences between the identity system of\n\nother countries and the UID scheme, yet there are lessons from the\n\nglobal experience to be learnt before proceeding with the implementation\n\nof the UID scheme, which the Ministry of Planning has ignored\n\ncompletely;\n\n(viii) Considering the huge database and possibility of misuse of information,\n\nthe enactment of a national data protection law is a pre-requisite for any\n\nlaw that deals with large scale collection of information from individuals\n\nand its linkages across separate databases. In the absence of data\n\nprotection legislation, it would be difficult to deal with issues like access to\n\nand misuse of personal information, surveillance, profiling, linking and\n\nmatching of data bases and securing confidentiality of information;\n\n(ix) The Standing Committee strongly disapproved of the hasty manner in\n\nwhich the UID scheme was approved. Unlike many other schemes /\n\nprojects, no comprehensive feasibility study, which ought to have been\n\ndone before approving such an expensive scheme, was done involving all\n\naspects of the UID scheme including a cost-benefit analysis, comparative\n\ncosts of Aadhaar numbers and various existing forms of identity, financial\n\nimplications and prevention of identity theft, for example, using hologram\n\nenabled ration cards to eliminate fake and duplicate beneficiaries;\n\n(x) The UID scheme may end up being dependent on private agencies,\n\ndespite contractual agreements made by the UIDAI with several private\nPART E\n\nvendors. As a result, the beneficiaries may be forced to pay over and\n\nabove the charges to be prescribed by the UIDAI for availing of benefits\n\nand services, which are now available free of cost;\n\n(xi) The scheme is full of uncertainty in technology as a complex scheme is\n\nbuilt up on untested and unreliable technology and on several\n\nassumptions. It is also not known as to whether the proof of concept\n\nstudies and assessment studies undertaken by the UIDAI have explored\n\nthe possibilities of maintaining accuracy to a large level of enrolment of\n\n1.2 billion people; and\n\n(xii) The Committee felt that entrusting the responsibility of verification of\n\ninformation of individuals to the registrars to ensure that only genuine\n\nresidents get enrolled into the system may have far reaching\n\nconsequences for national security. Given the limitation of any\n\nmechanism such as a security audit by an appropriate agency that would\n\nbe set up for verifying the information, it is not evident as to whether a\n\ncomplete verification of information of all Aadhaar number holders is\n\npractically feasible; and whether it would deliver the intended results\n\nwithout compromising national security.\n\nWith these apprehensions about the UID scheme, the Standing Committee on\n\nFinance categorically conveyed that the National Identification Authority of\n\nIndia Bill, 2010 was not acceptable. The Committee urged the Government to\nPART E\n\nreconsider and review the UID scheme and the proposals contained in the Bill\n\nand bring forth a fresh legislation before Parliament. Ultimately, the NIA Bill\n\nwas withdrawn from the Rajya Sabha on 3 March, 2016.\n\n112 A comparison of the Aadhaar Act 2016 and NIA Bill 2010 reveals that\n\nboth have a common objective and framework − establishing a system of\n\nunique identity numbers, which would be implemented and monitored by a\n\nstatutory authority. The NIA Bill was not a Money Bill. It was never passed by\n\nthe Rajya Sabha. The Bill was scrutinized by a Standing Committee on\n\nFinance, which had 10 members from the Rajya Sabha and 21 from the Lok\n\nSabha. The NIA Bill did not contain a provision, similar to Section 7 of the\n\nAadhaar Act. Yet, as discussed earlier, the presence of\nSection 7\ndoes not\n\nmake the Aadhaar Act a Money Bill. Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money\n\nBill deprived the Rajya Sabha of its power to reject or amend the Bill. Since\n\nthe Aadhaar Act in its current form was introduced as a Money Bill in the Lok\n\nSabha, the Rajya Sabha had no option other than of making\n\nrecommendations to the Bill. The recommendations made by the Rajya Sabha\n\n(which also included deletion of\nSection 57\n) were rejected by the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe legislative history is a clear pointer to the fact that the subsequent\n\npassage of the Bill as a Money Bill by-passed the constitutional authority of\n\nthe Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha was deprived of its legitimate\n\nconstitutional role by the passage of the Bill as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha.\nPART E\n\n113 The Court must also address the contention of the Respondents that\n\nthe Aadhaar Act is “in pith and substance” a Money Bill. The learned Attorney\n\nGeneral for India has submitted that though the Act has ancillary provisions,\n\nits main objective is the delivery of subsidies, benefits and services flowing out\n\nof the Consolidated Fund of India and that the other provisions are related to\n\nthe main purpose of the Act which was giving subsidies and benefits. It has\n\nbeen submitted that the real test to be applied in the present dispute is the\n\ndoctrine of pith and substance.\n\n114 This Court has applied the doctrine of pith and substance when the\n\nlegislative competence of a legislature to enact a law is challenged. The\n\ndoctrine is applied to evaluate whether an enactment which is challenged falls\n\nwithin an entry in one of the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule over which\n\nthe legislature has competence under\nArticle 246\nof the Constitution. The\n\nSeventh Schedule to the Constitution distributes legislative powers between\n\nthe Union and the States. When a law enacted by a legislature is challenged\n\non the ground of a lack of legislative competence, the doctrine of pith and\n\nsubstance is invoked. Under the doctrine, the law will be valid if in substance,\n\nit falls within the ambit of a legislative entry on which the legislature is\n\ncompetent to enact a law, even if it incidentally trenches on a legislative entry\n\nin a separate list. The constitutional rationale for the application of this\nPART E\n\ndoctrine has been explained in a Constitution Bench decision of this Court in\n\nA S Krishna v State of Madras176\n:\n\n“8…But then, it must be remembered that we are construing a\nfederal Constitution. It is of the essence of such a\nConstitution that there should be a distribution of the\nlegislative powers of the Federation between the Centre\nand the Provinces. The scheme of distribution has varied\nwith different Constitutions, but even when the Constitution\nenumerates elaborately the topics on which the Centre and\nthe States could legislate, some overlapping of the fields of\nlegislation is inevitable. The British North America Act, 1867,\nwhich established a federal Constitution for Canada,\nenumerated in\nSections 91\nand\nthe topics on which the\nDominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate.\nNotwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be\nfairly full and comprehensive, it was not long before it\nwas found that the topics enumerated in the two sections\noverlapped, and the Privy Council had time and again to\npass on the constitutionality of laws made by the\nDominion and Provincial legislatures. It was in this\nsituation that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine, that\nfor deciding whether an impugned legislation was intra\nvires, regard must be had to its pith and substance. That\nis to say, if a statute is found in substance to relate to a\ntopic within the competence of the legislature, it should\nbe held to be intra vires, even though it might incidentally\ntrench on topics not within its legislative competence...”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe decision of a three judge Bench of this Court in\nState of Maharashtra v\n\nBharat Shanti Lal Shah177\nhas summarized the process of reasoning which\n\nmust be followed by the Court while applying the doctrine of pith and\n\nsubstance. The Court held:\n\n“43…If there is a challenge to the legislative competence the\ncourts will try to ascertain the pith and substance of such\nenactment on a scrutiny of the Act in question. In this\nprocess, it is necessary for the courts to go into and\nexamine the true character of the enactment, its object,\nits scope and effect to find out whether the enactment in\n\n176 1957 SCR 399\n177(2008) 13 SCC 5\nPART E\n\nquestion is genuinely referable to the field of legislation\nallotted to the respective Legislature under the\nconstitutional scheme. Where a challenge is made to the\nconstitutional validity of a particular State Act with reference\nto a subject mentioned in any entry in List I, the court has to\nlook to the substance of the State Act and on such analysis\nand examination, if it is found that in the pith and substance, it\nfalls under an entry in the State List but there is only an\nincidental encroachment on topics in the Union List, the State\nAct would not become invalid merely because there is\nincidental encroachment on any of the topics in the Union\nList.”178 (Emphasis supplied )\n\n115 The doctrine of pith and substance is mainly used to examine whether\n\nthe legislature has the competence to enact a law with regard to any of the\n\nthree Lists provided under the Constitution. It cannot be applied to sustain as\n\na Money Bill, a Bill which travels beyond the constitutional boundaries set out\n\nby\nArticle 110\nWhether a Bill is validly passed as a Money Bill has nothing to\n\ndo with the legislative competence of the legislature under\nArticle 246\nof the\n\nConstitution. Whether a Bill is a Money Bill has to be tested within the\n\nboundaries of\nArticle 110.\nThe submission of the Attorney General boils down\n\nto this: ‘ignore the expression “only provisions dealing with all or any of the\n\nfollowing matters” and hold the Bill to be a Money Bill by treating\nSection 7\nas\n\nits dominant provision’. This cannot be accepted. This would ignore the\n\nexpress and clear language of\nArticle 110.\nAs we have emphasised earlier,\n\nthe submission of the Attorney General requires the court to transpose the\n\nword “only” from its present position to a place before “if”. That would be to\n\nrewrite the Constitution to mean that a Bill would be a Money Bill if it\n\ncontained some provisions which fall under sub-clauses (a) to (g). The\n\n178 Ibid, at page 21\nPART E\n\nConstitution says to the contrary: a Bill is a Money Bill if it contains “only\n\nprovisions” dealing with one or more of the matters set out in sub-clauses (a)\n\nto (g). Looked at in another way, all the provisions of the Aadhaar Act (apart\n\nfrom\nSection 7\n) cannot be read as incidental to\nSection 7\n. Such a view is\n\nbelied by a plain reading of the Act, as indicated earlier. Moreover, we have\n\nalso indicated reasons why even\nSection 7\ncannot be held to be referable to\n\nArticle 110.\n\nSection 7\ndoes not deal with the declaring of any expenditure as\n\nexpenditure charged to the Consolidated Fund.\nSection 7\nallows for making\n\nAadhaar mandatory for availing of subsidies, benefits or services the\n\nexpenditure incurred on which is charged to the Consolidate Fund.\nSection 7\n\ndoes not charge any expenditure to the Consolidated Fund. It deals with\n\nmaking Aadhaar mandatory.\n\nIn support of their contention, the Respondents have also relied upon a two\n\njudge Bench decision in\nUnion of India v Shah Goverdhan L Kabra\n\nTeachers’ College179\nto submit that the doctrine of pith and substance can be\n\nused in any context. The Court held:\n\n“7. It is further a well-settled principle that entries in the\ndifferent lists should be read together without giving a narrow\nmeaning to any of them. Power of the Parliament as well as\nthe State legislature are expressed in precise and definite\nterms. While an entry is to be given its widest meaning but it\ncannot be so interpreted as to over-ride another entry or\nmake another entry meaningless and in case of an apparent\nconflict between different entries, it is the duty of the court to\nreconcile them. When it appears to the Court that there is\napparent overlapping between the two entries the doctrine of\n\"pith and substance\" has to be applied to find out the true\nnature of a legislation and the entry with which it would fall. In\n\n179 (2002) 8 SCC 228\nPART E\n\ncase of conflict between entries in List I and List II, the same\nhas to be decided by application of the principle of \"pith and\nsubstance\". The doctrine of \"pith and substance\" means\nthat if an enactment substantially falls within the powers\nexpressly conferred by the Constitution upon the\nlegislature which enacted it, it cannot be held to be\ninvalid, merely because it incidentally encroaches on\nmatters assigned to another legislature. When a law is\nimpugned as being ultra-vires of the legislative competence,\nwhat is required to be ascertained is the true character of the\nlegislation. If on such an examination it is found that the\nlegislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the\nlegislature then it must be held to be valid in its entirety even\nthough it might incidentally trench on matters which are\nbeyond its competence. In order to examine the true\ncharacter of the enactment, the entire Act, its object and\nscope and effect, is required to be gone into. The question of\ninvasion into the territory of another legislation is to be\ndetermined not by degree but by substance. The doctrine of\n\"pith and substance' has to be applied not only in cases\nof conflict between the powers of two legislatures but in\nany case where the question arises whether a legislation\nis covered by particular legislative power in exercise of\nwhich it is purported to be made.”180 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe decision is of no assistance to the submission in the present dispute. The\n\nobservations made by the Court are in relation to the power to legislate under\n\nArticle 246\nof the Constitution. It is unconnected to the question of a Money\n\nBill. Therefore, the argument that the Aadhaar Act is “in pith and substance” a\n\nMoney Bill is rejected.\n\n116 Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill has bypassed the\n\nconstitutional authority of the Rajya Sabha. The passage of the Aadhaar Act\n\nas a Money Bill is an abuse of the constitutional process. It deprived the Rajya\n\nSabha from altering the provisions of the Bill by carrying out amendments. On\n\nthe touchstone of the provisions of\nArticle 110\n, the Bill could not have been\n180 Ibid, at pages 233-234\nPART E\n\ncertified as a Money Bill. In his last address to the Constituent Assembly on\n\n25 November 1949, Dr B R Ambedkar had stated:\n\n“The working of a Constitution does not depend wholly upon\nthe nature of the Constitution. The Constitution can provide\nonly the organs of State such as the Legislature, the\nExecutive and the Judiciary. The factors on which the working\nof those organs of the State depends are the people and the\npolitical parties they will set up as their instruments to carry\nout their wishes and their politics.”181\n\n117 The Rajya Sabha has an important role in the making of laws.\n\nSuperseding the authority of the Rajya Sabha is in conflict with the\n\nconstitutional scheme and the legitimacy of democratic institutions. It\n\nconstitutes a fraud on the Constitution. Passing of a Bill as a Money Bill, when\n\nit does not qualify for it, damages the delicate balance of bicameralism which\n\nis a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The ruling party in power\n\nmay not command a majority in the Rajya Sabha. But the legislative role of\n\nthat legislative body cannot be obviated by legislating a Bill which is not a\n\nMoney Bill as a Money Bill. That would constitute a subterfuge, something\n\nwhich a constitutional court cannot countenance. Differences in a democratic\n\npolity have to be resolved by dialogue and accommodation. Differences with\n\nanother constitutional institution cannot be resolved by the simple expedient of\n\nignoring it. It may be politically expedient to do so. But it is constitutionally\n\nimpermissible. This debasement of a democratic institution cannot be allowed\n\nto pass. Institutions are crucial to democracy. Debasing them can only cause\n\na peril to democratic structures.\n\n181 Constituent Assembly (25 November 1949)\nPART F\n\nThe Act\nthus fails to qualify as a Money Bill under\nArticle 110\nof the\n\nConstitution. Since the Act was passed as a Money Bill, even though it does\n\nnot qualify to be so, the passage of the Act is an illegality. The Aadhaar Act is\n\nin violation of\nArticle 110\nand therefore is liable to be declared\n\nunconstitutional.\n\nF Biometrics, Privacy and Aadhaar\n\n“Any situation that allows an interaction between man and\nmachine is capable of incorporating biometrics”182\n\n118 The term ‘biometric’ is derived from the Greek nouns ‘βίος’ (life) and\n\n‘μέτρον’ (measure) and means ‘measurement of living species’. 183 Biometric\n\ntechnologies imply that “unique or distinctive human characteristics of a\n\nperson are collected, measured and stored for the automated verification of a\n\nclaim made by that person for the identification of that person.”184 These\n\nsystems thus identify or verify the identity or a claim of persons on the basis of\n\nthe automated measurement and analysis of their biological traits (such as\n\nfingerprints, face and iris) or behavioral characteristics (such as signature and\n\nvoice).\n\n182 Gary Roethenbaugh, (cited in A. Cavoukian, Privacy and Biometrics, Information and Privacy Commissioner,\nOntario, Canada, 1999, page 11, available at http://www.ipc.on.ca/images/Resources/pri- biom.pdf\n183 Els J. Kindt, Privacy and Data Protection Issues of Biometric Applications: A Comparative Legal Analysis,\n\nSpringer (2013)\n184 Ibid.\nPART F\n\n119 The idea that parts of our body can be used to identify our unique\n\nselves is not new. Prints of hand, foot and finger have been used since\n\nancient times because of their unique characteristics. Before the advent of\n\nbiometric systems, however, human characteristics were compared in a\n\nmanual way. Today’s biometric systems hence differ from manual verification\n\nmethods in that technology allows for automated comparison of human\n\ncharacteristic(s) in place of a regime of manual verification that existed earlier.\n\nIt must be understood that biometric systems themselves do not identify\n\nindividuals. For identification, additional information which is already stored in\n\ndatabases is needed since biometric systems can only compare information\n\nwhich is already submitted.185 Integral to such a system is the matching of a\n\nclaim of identity with biometric data collected and stored earlier.\n\nIn general, biometric applications are referred to as systems which allow one\n\nto authenticate claims. The verb ‘to authenticate’ can be described as ‘making\n\nauthentic, legally valid’.186 Originally, fingerprints were the most commonly\n\nknown and used biometric traits, but with improvements in technology,\n\nmultiple sources of biometric information have emerged. These include data\n\nrelated to facial features, iris, voice, hand geometry and DNA. Each trait is\n\ncollected using different technologies and can be used for different purposes\n\n185 Ibid.\n\n186 Ibid.\nPART F\n\nseparately or in combination, to strengthen and improve the accuracy and\n\nreliability of the identification process.187\n\nIn general, biometric information is developed by processing extractable key\n\nfeatures of an individual into an ‘electronic digital template’, which is then\n\nencrypted and stored in a database. When an individual connects with the\n\nsystem to verify his/her identity for any purpose, the information is used by\n\nmatching the ‘electronic digital template’ saved with the biometric information\n\npresented, based on which comparison, the individual’s identity will be\n\nconfirmed or rejected. The intended purpose of biometric technology is to\n\nconfirm the identity of individuals through a “one to one” identification check.\n\nThis system compares a source of biometric data with existing data for that\n\nspecific person.\n\nF.I Increased use of biometric technology\n\n120 There had been an initial increase in the usage of biometric technology\n\nin both developed and developing countries by both the private and the public\n\nsector. However, despite the increased adoption of biometric technologies by\n\ndeveloped countries in the 1980s and 1990s, recent trends depict their\n\nreluctance to deploy biometric technology - or at least mass storage of\n\nbiometric data - because of privacy concerns.188 Key instances included the\n\n187Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013).\n188Privacy International, Biometrics: Friend or foe of privacy?, available at\nhttps://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/Biometrics_Friend_or_foe.pdf\nPART F\n\nscrapping of the National Identity Register and ID cards in the UK, and\n\nGermany’s decision to reject a centralised database when deploying biometric\n\npassports.189 By contrast, in developing countries there is a rise in the\n\ndeployment of biometric technology since it is being portrayed to citizens as a\n\nmeans to establishing their legal identity and providing them access to\n\nservices, as well as a tool for achieving economic development. However, too\n\noften these goals are prioritised at the expense of their right to privacy and\n\nother human rights.190 Simon Davies, an eminent privacy expert, points out\n\nthat it is not an accident or coincidence that biometric systems are most\n\naggressively tried out with welfare recipients since they are not in a position to\n\nresist the State-mandated intrusion.191\n\nThere has been a particular increase in the use of biometric technology in\n\nidentification programs in developing countries. This is because “biometrics\n\ninclude a wide range of biological measures which are considered sufficiently\n\nunique at a population level to allow individual identification with high rates of\n\naccuracy”.192 Lack of formal identification and official identity documentation in\n\nthe developing world is a serious challenge which impedes the ability of\n\ngovernments as well as development organisations to provide essential goods\n\nand services to the populations they serve.193 Further, identification is also\n\n189 Ibid\n190 Ibid\n191 Simon Davies, as cited in John D.

Norman, Alexandra Grigore and Alain B. Labrique, Can biometrics beat the\n\ndeveloping world’s challenges?, Biometric Technology Today (2016)\n193 Ibid\nPART F\n\nessential to the gathering of accurate data which is required for monitoring the\n\nprogress of government programmes.194 However, while biometric technology\n\nbrings many advantages, the flip side is that the same technology can also\n\nlead to human rights violations:\n\n“When adopted in the absence of strong legal frameworks\nand strict safeguards, biometric technologies pose grave\nthreats to privacy and personal security, as their application\ncan be broadened to facilitate discrimination, profiling and\nmass surveillance. The varying accuracy and failure rates of\nthe technology can lead to misidentification, fraud and civic\nexclusion.”195\n\n121 The adoption of biometric technologies in developing countries in\n\nparticular poses unique challenges since the implementation of new\n\ntechnologies in these countries is rarely preceded by the enactment of robust\n\nlegal frameworks. Assessments of countries where a legal mechanism to\n\nregulate new technologies or protect data has followed as an afterthought\n\nhave shown that there exists a huge risk of mass human rights violations\n\nwhere individuals are denied basic fundamental rights, and in extreme cases,\n\neven their identity.196\n\n122 Technology today brings with it tremendous power and is much like two\n\nsides of a coin. When applied productively, it allows individuals around the\n\nworld to access information, express themselves and participate in local and\n\nglobal discussions in real-time in ways previously thought unimaginable. The\n\n194 Ibid\n195 Privacy International, Biometrics, available at https://privacyinternational.org/topics/biometrics\n196 Privacy International, Biometrics: Friend or foe of privacy?, available at\n\nhttps://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/Biometrics_Friend_or_foe.pdf\nPART F\n\nflip side is the concern over the abuse of new technology, including\n\nbiometrics, by the State and private entities by actions such as surveillance\n\nand large-scale profiling. This is particularly acute, given the fact that\n\ntechnological advancements have far outpaced legislative change. As a\n\nconsequence, the safeguards necessary to ensure protection of human rights\n\nand data protection are often missing. The lack of regulatory frameworks, or\n\nthe inadequacy of existing frameworks, has societal and ethical consequences\n\nand poses a constant risk that the concepts of privacy, liberty and other\n\nfundamental freedoms will be misunderstood, eroded or devalued.197\n\n123 Privacy has been recognized as a fundamental human right in various\n\nnational constitutions and numerous global and regional human rights treaties.\n\nIn today’s digital age, the right to privacy is “the cornerstone that safeguards\n\nwho we are and supports our on-going struggle to maintain our autonomy and\n\nself-determination in the face of increasing state power.”198\n\n124 The proliferation of biometric technology has facilitated the invasion of\n\nindividual privacy at an unprecedented scale. The raw information at the heart\n\nof biometrics is personal by its very nature.199 The Aadhaar Act recognises\n\nthis as sensitive personal information. Biometric technology is unique in the\n\nsense that it uses part of the human body or behaviour as the basis of\n\nauthentication or identification and is therefore intimately connected to the\n197 Ibid\n198 Privacy International, Biometrics: Friend or foe of privacy?, available at\nhttps://privacyinternational.org/sites/default/files/2017-11/Biometrics_Friend_or_foe.pdf\n199 Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013)\nPART F\n\nindividual concerned. While biometric technology raises some of the same\n\nissues that arise when government agencies or private firms collect any\n\npersonal information about citizens, there are specific features that distinguish\n\nbiometric data from other personal data, making concerns about biometric\n\ntechnology of particular importance with regard to privacy protection.200\n\n125 There are two main groups of privacy- related interests that are directly\n\npertinent to the contemporary discussion on the ethical and legal implications\n\nof biometrics.201 The first group falls under ‘informational privacy’ and is\n\nconcerned with control of personal information. The ability to control personal\n\ninformation about oneself is closely related to the dignity of the individual, self-\n\nrespect and sense of personhood. The second interest group falls under the\n\nrubric of ‘physical privacy’. This sense of privacy transcends the purely\n\nphysical and is aimed essentially at protecting the dignity of the human\n\nperson. It is a safeguard against intrusions into persons’ physical bodies and\n\nspaces. Another issue is of property rights with respect to privacy, which\n\nconcerns the appropriation and ownership of interests in human personality. In\n\nmany jurisdictions, the basis of informational privacy is the notion that all\n\ninformation about an individual is in some fundamental way their own\n\nproperty, and it is theirs to communicate or retain as they deem fit.\n\n200 Ibid\n201 Ibid\nPART F\n\n126 The collection of most forms of biometric data requires some\n\ninfringement of the data subject’s personal space. Iris and fingerprint scanners\n\nrequire close proximity of biometric sensors to body parts such as eyes, hands\n\nand fingertips.\n\nEven in the context of law enforcement and forensic identification, the use of\n\nfingerprinting is acknowledged to jeopardise physical privacy. Many countries\n\nhave laws and regulations which are intended to regulate such measures, in\n\norder to protect the individual’s rights against infringement by state powers\n\nand law enforcement. However, biometrics for the purpose of authentication\n\nand identification is different as they do not have a specific goal of finding\n\ntraces related to a crime but are instead conducted for the purpose of\n\ngenerating identity information specific to an individual. This difference in\n\npurpose actually renders the collection of physical biometrics a more serious\n\nbreach of integrity and privacy. It indicates that there may be a presumption\n\nthat someone is guilty until proven innocent. This would be contrary to\n\ngenerally accepted legal doctrine that a person is innocent until proven guilty\n\nand will bring a lot of innocent people into surveillance schemes.\n\n127 Concerns about physical privacy usually take a backseat as compared\n\nto concerns about informational privacy. The reason for this is that physical\n\nintrusion resulting from the use of biometric technology usually results from\n\nthe collection of physical information. However, for some people of specific\nPART F\n\ncultural or religious backgrounds, even the mental harm resulting from\n\nphysical intrusion maybe quite serious.202\n\nAnother concern is that the widespread usage of biometrics substantially\n\nundermines the right to remain anonymous.203 People desire anonymity for a\n\nvariety of reasons, including that it is fundamental to their sense of freedom\n\nand autonomy. Anonymity may turn out to be the only tool available for\n\nordinary people to defend themselves against being profiled. Thus, it is often\n\nargued that biometric technology should not be the appropriate choice of\n\ntechnology as biometrics by its very nature is inconsistent with anonymity.\n\nGiven the manner in which personal information can be linked and identified\n\nusing biometric data, the ability to remain anonymous is severely diminished.\n\nWhile some argue that “it is not obvious that more anonymity will be lost when\n\nbiometrics are used”, this argument may have to be evaluated in light of the\n\nfact that there is no existing identifier that can be readily equated with\n\nbiometrics.204 No existing identifier can expose as much information as\n\nbiometric data nor is there any other identifier that is supposed to be so\n\nuniversal, long-lasting and intimately linked as biometrics. To say that the use\n\nof biometrics will not cause further loss of anonymity may thus be overly\n\noptimistic. Semi-anonymity maybe possible, provided that the biometric\n\nsystem is carefully designed from the inception.\n\n202 Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013).\n203 Ibid\n204 Ibid\nPART F\n\nAnother significant change brought about by biometric technology is the\n\nprecipitous decline of ‘privacy by obscurity’, which is essentially “a form of\n\nprivacy afforded to individuals inadvertently by the inefficiencies of paper and\nother legacy recordkeeping.” Now that paper records worldwide are giving\n\nway to more efficient digital record-keeping and identification, this form of\n\nprivacy is being extinguished, and sometimes without commensurate data\n\nprivacy protections put in place to remedy the effects of the changes.”206\n\n128 Biometrically enhanced identity information, combined with\n\ndemographic data such as address, age and gender, among other data, when\n\nused in increasingly large, automated systems creates profound changes in\n\nsocieties, particularly in regard to data protection, privacy, and security.\n\nBiometrics are at the very heart of identification systems. There are numerous\n\ninstances in history where the persecution of groups of civilians on the basis\n\nof race, ethnicity and religion was facilitated through the use of identification\n\nsystems. There is hence an alarming need to ensure that the on-going\n\ndevelopment of identification systems be carefully monitored, while taking into\n\naccount lessons learnt from history.\n\n129 It is important to justify the usage of biometric technology given the\n\ninvasion of privacy. When the purpose of collecting the biometric data is just\n\nfor authentication and there is little or no benefit in having stronger user\n205 Pam Dixon, A Failure to Do No Harm – India’s Aadhaar biometric ID program and its inability to protect\nprivacy in relation to measures in Europe and the U.S., Health and Technology (2017), Vol. 7, at pages 539–\n206 Ibid.\nPART F\n\nidentification, it is difficult to justify the collection of biometric information. The\n\npotential fear is that there are situations where there are few or no benefits to\n\nbe gained from strong user verification / identification and this is where\n\nbiometric technology may be unnecessary.207 (Example: When ascertaining\n\nwhether an individual is old enough to go to a bar and drink alcohol, it is\n\nunnecessary to know who the person is, when all that is needed to be\n\ndemonstrated is that the individual is of legal age). Fundamental rights are\n\nlikely to be violated in case biometrics are used for applications merely\n\nrequiring a low level of security.\n\n130 Biometric data, by its very nature, is intrinsically linked to characteristics\n\nthat make us ‘humans’ and its broad scope brings together a variety of\n\npersonal elements. It is argued that the collection, analysis and storage of\n\nsuch innate data is dehumanising as it reduces the individual to but a number.\n\nUltimately, organisations and governmental agencies must demonstrate that\n\nthere is a compelling legitimate interest in using biometric technology and that\n\nan obligatory fingerprint requirement is reasonably related to the objective for\n\nwhich it is required. One way of avoiding unnecessary collection of biometric\n\ndata is to set strict legal standards to ensure that the intrusion into privacy is\n\ncommensurate with and proportional to the need for the collection of bio-\n\nmetric data.208\n\n207 Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013).\n208 Ibid\nPART F\n\nF.2 Consent in the collection of biometric data\n\n131 Rules on the collection of physical data by government agencies usually\n\nspecify under what conditions a person can be required to provide fingerprints\n\nand/or bodily tissues. If consent is required, rules are in place to regulate the\n\nscope of consent. If forced searches are allowed, specifications are usually\n\nprovided as to how and by whom the search will be performed. Therefore, the\n\nlegal questions surrounding the issue should be:\n\n(a) If required, what exactly should be the extent of coverage of the consent?\n\n(b) When is the compulsory collection of biometric information required and\n\nwho is eligible to conduct it?\n\n(c) What is the procedure to do so?\n\n(d)What exactly should be filed and stored?\n\n132 Biometric technology is far from being a mature technology and a\n\nvariety of errors inevitably occur. Mature technology is a popular term for any\n\ntechnology for which any improvements in deployment are evolutionary rather\n\nthan revolutionary.209 Once a biometric system is compromised, it is\n\ncompromised forever. In the event of biometric identity theft, there would\n\nappear to be no alternative but to withdraw the user from the system.\n\nPasswords and numbers can be changed, but how does one change the basic\n\nbiological features that compromise biometrics in the event that there is a\n\ntheft?\n\n209 Segen’s Medical Dictionary, 2012.\nPART F\n\nAll of these parameters need to be applied to test the validity of the Aadhaar\n\nlegislation in a two-part inquiry: First, reports and steps taken by the\n\nGovernment of India that guided the introduction and role of biometrics before\n\nthe enactment of the Aadhaar Act will be analysed, which will be followed by\n\nan analysis of relevant provisions concerning the intersection of biometric\n\ntechnology and privacy, as they are enshrined in the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and\n\nsupporting Regulations made under it.\n\nF.3 Position before the Aadhaar legislation\n\nSummary of Pre-Enactment Events\n\n133 On 3 March 2006, the Department of Information Technology, Ministry\n\nof Communications & Information Technology, gave its approval for\n\nimplementation of the project ‘Unique ID for Below Poverty Line Families’\n\n(BPL) by the National Informatics Centre over a period of 12 months.210 This\n\nwas followed by a Processes Committee being set up a few months later on 3\n\nJuly 2006, to suggest the processes for updation, modification, addition and\n\ndeletion of data from the core database to be created under the Unique ID\n\n(“UID”) for BPL Families Project.211 The Processes Committee prepared a\n\n210 Ministry of Communication & Information Technology, Department of Information Technology, Administrative\nApproval for the project - “Unique ID for BPL families”, dated March 03, 2006 (Annexure R-1, List of Pre-\nenactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project submitted by the Learned AG).\n211 Department of Information Technology, Notification: Setting up of a Process Committee to suggest the\nprocesses for updation, modification, addition & deletion of data and fields from the core database to be\ncreated under the Unique ID for BPL families project, dated July 03, 2006 (Annexure R-2, List of Pre-\nenactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project submitted by the learned AG).\nPART F\n\npaper titled ‘Strategic Vision: Unique Identification of Residents’212.

Biometrics was mentioned for\n\nthe first time in the context of UID, when the committee agreed that if the\n\ninfrastructure was available and the photograph and/or biometrics of a\n\n212 Strategic Vision: Unique Identification of Residents, dated 26 November 2006 (Annexure R-3, List of Pre-\n\nenactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project submitted by the learned AG).\n213 Ibid\n214 Ibid\n215 Ibid\n216 Ibid\n217 Constitution of an Empowered Group of Ministers to collate two schemes - the National Population Register\nunder the\nCitizenship Act, 1955\nand the Unique Identification Number (UID) project of the Department of\nInformation Technology (Annexure R-4, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project\nsubmitted by the learned AG).\nPART F\n\nresident was obtainable along with other information, it would be captured in\n\nthe initial and intermediate stages as well.218 Subsequently, the EGoM\n\napproved the establishment of a UID Authority under the Planning\n\nCommission on 28 January 2008.219 while the strategy to collate NPR and UID\n\nwas also approved. The EGoM also agreed that the collection of data under\n\nthe NPR exercise could include collection of photographs and biometrics to\n\nthe extent feasible, while it was also resolved that the data collected under the\n\nNPR would be handed over to the UID Authority for maintenance and\n\nupdation. The EGoM, in its fourth meeting dated 4 November 2008 decided\n\nthat initially, the UIDAI will be established as an executive body under the\n\nPlanning Commission for a period of 5 years. UIDAI, it was envisaged, will\n\ncreate its database from the electoral roll of the ECI and verify it through\n\nBelow Poverty Line and Public Distribution System data, but it would also\n\nhave the authority to take its own decisions as to how a database should be\n\nbuilt.220 Consequently, the Government of India issued a notification on 28\n\nJanuary 2009 constituting the UIDAI as an attached office and executive\n\nauthority under the aegis of the Planning Commission.\n\n218 Planning Commission, No. 4(4)/56/2005- C&I, Minutes of the Fifth Meeting of the Unique ID project under the\nChairmanship of Dr. Arvind Virmani (Annexure R-6, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar\nproject submitted by the learned AG).\n\n219 Minutes of the Second Meeting of the EGoM to collate two schemes - The National Population Register under\nthe\nCitizenship Act, 1955\nand the Unique Identification number (UID) project of the Department of Information\nTechnology (Annexure R-10, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project submitted by the\nlearned AG).\n\n220 Minutes of the Fourth Meeting of the EGoM to collate two schemes - The National Population Register under\nthe\nCitizenship Act, 1955\nand the Unique Identification Number (UID) project of the Department of Information\nTechnology (Annexure R-12, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project submitted by the\nlearned AG).\nPART F\n\n134 Following the constitution of UIDAI, the Secretary, Planning\n\nCommission addressed a letter to Chief Secretaries of all States/ UTs on 6\n\nMay 2009 enclosing a brief write up on UIDAI and UID numbers for resident\n\nIndians. The letter included the concept, implementation strategy, model of the\n\nproject along with the role and responsibilities of the states/ UTs.221 It was also\n\ndecided that partner databases for two-way linkages between the UID\n\ndatabase and the partner databases for maintenance and continuous updation\n\nof the UID databases would be ECI database, Ministry of Rural Development-\n\nrural household survey database and the State ration card (PDS) databases.\n\n135 The first meeting of the PM’s Council of UIDAI, was held on 12 August\n\n2009. Various proposals were approved by the Council,222 by which it was\n\ndecided, among other things, that the proposal to designate UIDAI as an apex\n\nbody to set standards in the area of biometrics and demographic data\n\nstructures be approved. On 29 September 2009, UIDAI set up the Biometrics\n\nStandards Committee (“BSC”) to frame biometric standards for UIDAI. The\n\nCommittee was assigned with the following mandate:223\n\n● To develop biometric standards that will ensure interoperability of devices,\n\nsystems and processes used by various agencies that use the UID system.\n\n221 Secretary, Government of India, Planning Commission, D.O.

In order to ensure that an individual was uniquely identified in an easy\n\nand cost-effective manner, it was necessary to ensure that the captured\n\nbiometric information was capable of carrying out de-duplication at the time\n\nwhen information was collected.225 The Know Your Resident (“KYR”)\n\n224 DDSVPC (UIDAI), DDSVPC Report, dated 09 December 2009, available at\nhttps://uidai.gov.in/images/UID_DDSVP_Committee_Report_v1.0.pdf ,at pages 5-6.\n225 Ibid, at page 4\nPART F\n\nverification procedure was introduced to ensure that “key demographic data is\n\nverified properly so that the data within UID system can be used for\n\nauthentication of identity by various systems”. Three distinct methods of\n\nverification were to be acceptable under UID. Verification could be based on\n\n● Supporting documents;\n\n● An introducer system under which a network of “approved” introducers can\n\nintroduce a resident and vouch for the validity of the resident’s information;\n\nand (This idea was borrowed from the account opening procedure in the\n\nbanks.)\n\n● The process adopted for public scrutiny in the National Population\n\nRegister.\n\n137 In order to verify the correctness of certain mandatory fields, such as\n\nname, date-of-birth, and address, a “Proof of Identity” (PoI) and “Proof of\n\nAddress” (PoA) would be required. This would comprise of documents\n\ncontaining the resident’s name and photograph and the name and address,\n\nrespectively. On 9 April 2010, the collection of iris biometrics for the NPR\n\nexercise was approved.226\n\n138 A strategy overview issued by UIDAI in April 2010 described the\n\nfeatures, benefits, revenue model and timelines of the project.227 The survey\n\n226 Annexure R-43, Volume II, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project, Submissions by\nthe AG\n227 UIDAI, UIDAI Strategy Overview, available at\n\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/UIDAI%20STRATEGY%20OVERVIEW.pdf.\nPART F\n\noutlined that UIDAI would collect the following demographic and biometric\n\ninformation from residents in order to issue a UID number:\n\n● Name\n● Date of birth\n● Gender\n● Father's/ Husband's/ Guardian's name and UID number (optional for adult\nresidents)\n● Mother's/ Wife's/ Guardian's name and UID number (optional for adult\nresidents)\n● Introducer's name and UID number ( in case of lack of documents)\n● Address\n● All ten fingerprints, photograph and both iris scans\n\nOn 12 May 2010, a note outlining the background of UIDAI, and proposing an\n\napproach for collection of demographic and biometric attributes of residents\n\nfor the UID project was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on UIDAI. 228\n\nPermission of the Union Cabinet was sought to ensure that the approach\n\nwhich was proposed should be adhered to by the Registrar General of India\n\nfor the NPR exercise and by all other Registrars in the UID system. The\n\nrationale behind the inclusion of iris biometrics and the need for capturing iris\n\nscans at the time of capturing biometric details was also explained.\n\nThis was followed by the introduction of the National Identification Authority of\n\nIndia Bill, 2010 (NIAI Bill) in the Rajya Sabha on 3 December 2010. On 13\n\nFebruary 2011, the one millionth Aadhaar card was delivered. Thereafter, on\n\n228Annexure R-46, Volume II, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project, Submissions by\nthe AG\nPART F\n\n11 April 2011, the Central Government notified the Information Technology\n\n(Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or\n\ninformation) Rules, 2011 [“IT Rules”] under\nSection 43A\nof the IT Act, 2000.\n\nOn 29 September 2011, the Aadhaar project completed one year. An\n\nannouncement was made of the generation of ten crore enrolments and of\n\nmore than 3.75 crore Aadhaar numbers.\n\nAnalysis of UIDAI Reports & Rights of Registrars\n\nA. Biometrics Standards Committee (BSC) Report\n\n139 BSC in its report dated 30 December 2009 stated that it held extensive\n\nmeetings and discussions with international experts and technology suppliers.\n\nA technical sub-group was formed to collect Indian fingerprints and analyze\n\nquality. Over 2,50,000 fingerprint images from 25,000 persons were sourced\n\nfrom the districts of Delhi, UP, Bihar and Orissa. Nearly all the images were\n\nfrom rural regions, and were collected by different agencies using different\n\ncapture devices, and through different operational processes. The BSC report\n\nis silent about the pretext on which fingerprints of 25,000 people were\n\ncollected. This action of UIDAI raises privacy concerns especially since the\n\nfingerprints were collected from rural regions where people may not have\n\nbeen aware or made aware by UIDAI before collection of fingerprints, of the\n\npossible privacy harms of giving up biometrics.\nPART F\n\nBSC after reviewing international standards and current national\n\nrecommendations, concluded that a fingerprints-based biometric system was\n\nto be at the core of UIDAI’s de-duplication efforts and that the ISO 19794\n\nseries of biometrics standards for fingerprints, face and iris set by the\n\nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) were most suitable for the UID\n\nproject.229 BSC also observed that while a fingerprints-based biometric system\n\nshall be at the core of UIDAI’s de-duplication efforts, its accuracy in the Indian\n\ncontext could not predicted in the absence of empirical data:\n\n“The Committee notes that face is the most commonly\ncaptured biometric, and frequently used in manual checking.\nHowever, stand-alone, automatic face recognition does not\nprovide a high level of accuracy, and can only be used to\nsupplement a primary biometric modality. Fingerprinting, the\noldest biometric technology, has the largest market share of\nall biometrics modalities globally. … Based on these factors,\nthe Committee recognizes that a fingerprints-based\nbiometrics system shall be at the core of the UIDAI’s de-\nduplication efforts…\n\nThe Committee, however, is also conscious of the fact that\nde-duplication of the magnitude required by the UIDAI has\nnever been implemented in the world. In the global context, a\nde-duplication accuracy of 99% has been achieved so far,\nusing good quality fingerprints against a database of up to\nfifty million. Two factors, however, raise uncertainty about the\naccuracy that can be achieved through fingerprints. First,\nretaining efficacy while scaling the database size from fifty\nmillion to a billion has not been adequately analyzed. Second,\nfingerprint quality, the most important variable for determining\nde-duplication accuracy, has not been studied in depth in the\nIndian context.”230\n\n140 In its report for discussion titled “Technical Standards for Digital Identity\n\nSystems for Digital Identity”, the Identification for Development (ID4D)\n\ninitiative, a cross-departmental effort report of the World Bank, noted that\n\n229 UIDAI Committee on Biometrics, Biometrics Design Standards For UID Applications, at page 4\n230 Ibid.\nPART F\n\nUIDAI had not implemented “an important security standard, ISO 24745,\n\nwhich provides guidance for the protection of biometric information for\n\nconfidentiality and integrity during storage or managing identities … due to the\n\ncomplexity of applicable compliance procedures” for the Aadhaar system. 231\n\nProponents of the program argue that in all fairness to UIDAI, it has to be\n\nnoticed that the ISO 24745 standard was published in August 2011 whereas\n\nthe report of BSC had already been submitted to UIDAI in January 2010.\n\nHowever, Mr. Myung Geun Chun, the Project Editor of ISO 24745, is reported\n\nto have stated that ISO 24745 standard is an ‘invaluable tool’ for addressing\n\n‘unique privacy concerns’ like ‘unlawful processing and use of data’ raised by\n\nbiometric identification because of its binding nature ‘which links biometrics\n\nwith personally identifiable information’.232\n\nISO 24745 seeks to “safeguard the security of a biometric system and the\n\nprivacy of data subjects with solid countermeasures”.233 ISO 24745 standard\n\nspecifies:\n\n● “Analysis of threats and countermeasures inherent in\nbiometric and biometric system application models;\n● Security requirements for binding between a biometric\nreference and an identity reference;\n\n● Biometric system application models with different\nscenarios for the storage and comparison of biometric\nreferences;\n\n● Guidance on the protection of an individual’s privacy during\nthe processing of biometric information.”234\n\n231 Identification for Development (World Bank Group), Technical Standards for Digital Identity Systems for Digital\nIdentity Draft for Discussion, available at http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/579151515518705630/ID4D-\nTechnical-Standards-for-Digital-Identity.pdf, at page 22.\n232 Katie Bird, Is your biometric data safe online?

Strategy Overview of 2010\n\nIn this report, a balance was sought to be struck between ‘privacy and\n\npurpose’ in respect of the information of the residents which was collected.\n\nThe report states that ‘agencies’ may store the information of the residents at\n\nthe time of enrolment, but they will not have access to the information stored\n\nin the UID database.235 Further, for the purposes of authentication, requests\n\nmade by the agencies would be answered through a ‘Yes’ or a ‘No’ response\n\nonly.236 Under the sub-heading “Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality”, the\n\nreport stated that the additional information which was being sought from\n\npeople was only biometric information like fingerprints and iris scans, as other\n\ninformation was already available with public and private agencies in the\n\ncountry.237 Right to privacy and confidentiality were sought to be protected by\n\nputting necessary provisions “in place”.238 It was also observed in the context\n\nof privacy that loss of biometric information of a resident who is a victim of\n\nidentity theft, especially when such information is linked to banking, social\n\nsecurity and passport records, risks financial and other assets and the\n\nreputation of the resident.239 According to the review, the envisaged UIDAI Act\n\n(which was still under contemplation at the time of publishing of this report and\n\nhad not yet been legislated) would have remedies for the following offences:\n\n235 UIDAI, UIDAI Strategy Overview, available at\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/UIDAI%20STRATEGY%20OVERVIEW. pdf, at page 4\n236 Ibid.\n\n237 Ibid, at page 32\n238 Ibid.\n\n239 Ibid, at page 33\nPART F\n\n● “Unauthorized disclosure of information by anyone in\nUIDAI, Registrar or the Enrolling agency;\n\n● Disclosure of information violating the protocols set in place\nby UIDAI;\n\n● Sharing any of the data on the database with anyone;\n● Engaging in or facilitating analysis of the data for anyone;\n● Engaging in or facilitating profiling of any nature for anyone\nor providing information for profiling of any nature for\nanyone;\n\n● All offences under the\nInformation Technology Act\nshall be\ndeemed to be offences under UIDAI if directed against\nUIDAI or its database.”240\n\nHowever, according to the report, UIDAI was to concern itself only with identity\n\nfraud and any grievances in respect of document fraud (counterfeit/\n\nmisleading documents) were to be left to the Registrar enrolling the\n\nresident.241\n\n141 The following conclusions emerge from the UIDAI’s strategy overview:\n\nFirstly, the UIDAI was aware of the importance of biometric information before\n\nthe Aadhaar programme had been rolled out. Secondly, UIDAI had itself\n\ncontemplated a scenario of identity theft which could occur at the time of\n\nenrollment for Aadhaar cards. However, it had no solution to the possible\n\nharms which could result after the identity theft of a person, more so when the\n\npotential ‘UIDAI Act’ was still in the pipeline and was not eventually enacted\n\nuntil 2016.\n\n240 Ibid.\n\n241 Ibid, at page 34\nPART F\n\nC. Registrars\n\n142 The term ‘Registrar’ was first defined by UIDAI in its DDSVPC Report as\n\n“any government or private agency that will partner with UIDAI in order to\n\nenroll and authenticate residents”.242 In the Strategy Overview, the term was\n\ndefined as “agencies such as central and state departments and private sector\n\nagencies who will be ‘Registrars’ for the UIDAI”.243\n\nThe Strategy Overview also stated that:\n\n“Registrars will process UID applications, and connect to the\nCIDR to de-duplicate resident information and receive UID\nnumbers. These Registrars can either be enrollers, or will\nappoint agencies as enrollers, who will interface with people\nseeking UID numbers. The Authority will also partner with\nservice providers for authentication. If the Registrar issues a\ncard to the resident, the UIDAI will recommend that the card\ncontain the UID number, name and photograph. They will be\nfree to add any more information related to their services\n(such as Customer ID by bank). They will also be free to\nprint/ store the biometric collected from the applicant on\nthe issued card. If more registrars store such biometric\ninformation in a single card format, the cards will become\ninteroperable for offline verification. But the UIDAI will not\ninsist on, audit or enforce this.”244 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n143 In the ‘Aadhaar Handbook for Registrars 2010’ (“2010 Handbook”),\n\nfollowing policy guidelines were laid down in respect of Registrars:\n\n1. “Registrars may retain the biometric data collected from\nresidents enrolled by them. However, the Registrar will have to\nexercise a fiduciary duty of care with respect to the data\ncollected from residents and will be responsible for loss,\nunauthorized access to and misuse of data in their custody.\n\n2. In order to ensure data integrity and security, the biometrics\ncaptured shall be encrypted upon collection by using the\n\n242 DDSVPC (UIDAI), DDSVPC Report, (9 December 2009), available at\nhttps://uidai.gov.in/images/UID_DDSVP_Committee_Report_v1.0. pdf , at page 5\n243 UIDAI, UIDAI Strategy Overview, available at\n\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/UIDAI%20STRATEGY%20OVERVIEW.pdf, at page 2\n244 Ibid, at page 15\nPART F\n\nencryption key defined by the Registrar. It is the responsibility\nof the Registrar to ensure the safety, security and\nconfidentiality of this data which is in their custody. The\nRegistrar must protect the data from unauthorized access and\nmisuse. The UIDAI will define guidelines for the storage of\nbiometric data in order to give the Registrar some\nguidance on ensuring security of the data. The Registrar\nshall have to define their own security policy and protocols to\nensure safety of the Biometric data. The Registrars shall bear\nliability for any loss, unauthorized access and misuse of this\ndata. In the interest of transparency, it is recommended\nthat the Registrar inform the resident that they will be\nkeeping the biometric data and also define how the data\nwill be used and how it will be kept secure.”245\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn the ‘Aadhaar Handbook for Registrars 2013’ (“2013 Handbook”), it was\n\nstated that “UIDAI has defined security guidelines for the storage of\n\nbiometric data”.246 While it is indicated in the handbook that guidelines for\n\nstorage were defined by UIDAI, it is evident that this took place only after 2010\n\nbefore which the registrars were functioning without guidelines mandating how\n\nthe biometric data was to be kept secure.\n\nThe following guideline finds mention both in the Handbook of 2010 and 2013:\n\n“In the interest of transparency, it is recommended that the\nRegistrar inform the resident that they will be keeping the\nbiometric data and also define how the data will be used and\nhow it will be kept secure”.247\n\nHowever, it is apparent from this guideline that it was merely a\n\nrecommendation to the Registrars, and no obligation was cast upon the\n\n245 UIDAI, Aadhaar Handbook for Registrars, available at\nhttp://doitc.rajasthan.gov.in/administrator/Lists/Downloads/Attachments/26/aadhaar_handbook_version. pdf,\nat page 11\n246 Annexure R-74, Volume III, List of Pre-enactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project, Submissions by\nthe AG.\n\n247 UIDAI (Planning Commission), Aadhaar Handbook for Registrars (2010), available at\nhttp://indiamicrofinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Aadhaar-Handbook. pdf, at page 11; UIDAI\n(Planning Commission), Aadhaar Handbook for Registrars (2013), at page 16 (Annexure R-74, List of Pre-\n\nenactment dates and events for the Aadhaar project submitted by the Learned AG).\nPART F\n\nRegistrars, to inform residents that their biometric data will be stored by them\n\nand how the data was to be used and kept secure. In contrast,\nRegulation 5\nof\n\nthe Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations 2016, states:\n\n“Responsibility of any agency or entity other than\nrequesting entity with respect to Aadhaar number. —\n\n(1) Any individual, agency or entity which collects\nAadhaar number or any document containing the\nAadhaar number, shall: (a) collect, store and use the\nAadhaar number for a lawful purpose; (b) inform the\nAadhaar number holder the following details:— i. the\npurpose for which the information is collected; ii.\n\nwhether submission of Aadhaar number or proof of\nAadhaar for such purpose is mandatory or voluntary, and\nif mandatory, the legal provision mandating it; iii.\nalternatives to submission of Aadhaar number or the\ndocument containing Aadhaar number, if any; (c) obtain\nconsent of the Aadhaar number holder to the collection,\nstorage and use of his Aadhaar number for the specified\npurposes.\n\n(2) Such individual, agency or entity shall not use the\nAadhaar number for any purpose other than those specified\nto the Aadhaar number holder at the time of obtaining his\nconsent.\n\n(3) Such individual, agency or entity shall not share the\nAadhaar number with any person without the consent of the\nAadhaar number holder.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n144 What the Registrar is obliged to do under law after the enactment of the\n\nAadhaar Act, was a recommendation to the Registrar prior to the enactment of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act. Thus, it is uncertain whether residents were informed about\n\nwhere and how their data would be kept secure since the guidelines to the\n\nRegistrars were only recommendatory in nature. Similarly, in a UIDAI\n\ndocument titled ‘Roles and Responsibilities of Enrollment Staff, 2017’, one of\n\nthe ‘Fifteen Commandments that an Operator must remember during Resident\n\nEnrollment’ is “Make sure that the resident is well informed that his/her\nPART F\n\nbiometric will only be used for Aadhaar Enrolment/Update and no other\n\npurpose”.248 However, in the UIDAI document titled ‘Enrollment Process\n\nEssentials, 2012’, there is no mention of any such obligation being placed\n\nupon the enrolment staff.249 In the absence of informed consent for the\n\ncollection of data, a shadow of potential illegality is cast.\n\nF.4 Privacy Concerns in the Aadhaar Act\n\n1 Consent during enrolment and authentication & the right to access\ninformation under the Aadhaar Act\n\n145 Section 3(2) of the Aadhaar Act requires enrolment agencies to inform\n\nthe individual being enrolled about: a) the manner in which information shall\n\nbe used; b) the nature of recipients with whom the information is to be shared\n\nduring authentication; and c) the existence of a right to access information.\n\nHowever, the Enrolment Form in Schedule I of the Enrolment Regulations\n\ndoes not offer any clarification or mechanism on how the mandate of\nSection\n\n3(2)\nis to be fulfilled.\n\nThe right of an individual to access information related to his or her\n\nauthentication record is recognized in\nSection 3(2)(c)\nand\nSection 32(2)\nof the\n\n248 UIDAI, Roles and Responsibilities of Enrolment Staff, available at\nhttps://idai.gov.in/images/annexure_b_roles_and_responsibility_of_enrolment_staff.

However, the supplementary regulations that complement the\n\nAct are bereft of detail on the procedure to access such information.\n\nSimilarly,\nRegulation 9(c)\nof the Enrolment Regulations states that the\n\nprocedure for accessing data would be provided to residents through the\n\nenrolment form, which is found in Schedule I to the Enrolment Regulations.\n\nHowever, all that Schedule I states is: “I have a right to access my identity\n\ninformation (except core biometrics) following the procedure laid down by\n\nUIDAI”, without any such procedure actually being laid down.\nSection 2(I)\nof the Act, which defines an enrolling agency read with\n\nRegulation 23\nof the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations allows for\n\nthe collection of sensitive personal data (demographic and biometric\n\ninformation) of individuals by private agencies, which also have to discharge\n\nthe burden of explaining the voluntary nature of Aadhaar registration and\n\nobtaining an individual’s informed consent.\n\nThe Authentication Regulations, framed under sub-section (1), and sub-\n\nclauses (f) and (w) of sub-section (2) of Section 54 of the Aadhaar Act deal\n\nwith the authentication framework for Aadhaar numbers, the governance of\n\nauthentication agencies and the procedure for collection, storage of\n\nauthentication data and records.\nRegulation 5 (1)\nstates what details shall be\n\nmade available to the Aadhaar number holder at the time of authentication\nPART F\n\nwhich are a) the nature of information that will be shared by the Authority upon\n\nauthentication, (b) the uses to which the information received during\n\nauthentication may be put; and (c) alternatives to submission of identity\n\ninformation.\nRegulation 6 (2)\nmandates that a requesting entity shall obtain the\n\nconsent of an Aadhaar number holder for authentication in physical or,\n\npreferably, in electronic form and maintain logs or records of the consent\n\nobtained in the manner and form as may be specified by the Authority for this\n\npurpose.\n\nAlthough\nRegulation 5\nmentions that at the time of authentication, requesting\n\nentities shall inform the Aadhaar number holder of alternatives to submission\n\nof identity information for the purpose of authentication, and\nRegulation 6\n\nmandates that the requesting entity shall obtain the consent of the Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder for the authentication, in neither of the above circumstances do\n\nthe regulations specify the clearly defined options that should be made\n\navailable to the Aadhaar number holder in case they do not wish to submit\n\nidentity information, nor do the regulations specify the procedure to be\n\nfollowed in case the Aadhaar number holder does not provide consent. This is\n\na significant omission. Measures for providing alternatives must be defined in\n\nall identity systems, particularly those that are implemented on a large scale.\nPART F\n\n2 Extent of information disclosed during authentication & sharing of\n\ncore biometric information\nSection 8(4)\nof the Act permits the Authority to respond to an\n\nauthentication query with a “positive, negative or any other appropriate\n\nresponse sharing such identity information excluding any core biometric\n\ninformation”. The petitioners have argued that the wide ambit of this provision\n\ngives the Authority discretion to respond to the requesting entity with\n\ninformation including an individual’s photograph, name, date of birth, address,\n\nmobile number, email address and any other demographic information that\n\nwas disclosed at the time of enrolment.\n\nMoreover, it must be realized that even if core biometric information cannot be\n\nshared, demographic information is nonetheless, sensitive.\nRegulation 2(j)\nof\n\nthe Authentication Regulations250 provides that a digitally signed response\n\nwith e-KYC data251 [which is defined in\nRegulation 2(k)\n] can be returned to the\n\nrequesting entity, while\nRegulation 3(ii)\nprovides for this form of\n\nauthentication (e-KYC) by UIDAI.\nRegulation 2(j)\nof Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations: “e-KYC authentication facility” means a type of\nauthentication facility in which the biometric information and/or OTP and Aadhaar number securely submitted\nwith the consent of the Aadhaar number holder through a requesting entity, is matched against the data\navailable in the CIDR, and the Authority returns a digitally signed response containing e-KYC data along with\nother technical details related to the authentication transaction.\nRegulation 2(k)\nof Aadhaar Authentication Regulations: “e-KYC data” means demographic information and\n\nphotograph of an Aadhaar number holder.\nRegulation 3(ii)\nof Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, 2016: “3. Types of Authentication-There shall be\n\ntwo types of authentication facilities provided by the Authority, namely— (i) Yes/No authentication\nfacility, which may be carried out using any of the modes, (ii) e-KYC authentication facility, which may be\ncarried out only using OTP and/ or biometric authentication modes as specified in regulation 4(2)”.\nPART F\n\n148 Section 29(1) of the Aadhaar Act expressly states that ‘core biometric\n\ninformation can never be shared with anyone for any reason whatsoever or be\n\nused for any purpose other than generation of Aadhaar numbers and\n\nauthentication under this Act’. However, this provision which seemingly\n\nprotects an individual’s core biometric information from being shared is\n\ncontradicted by\nSection 29(4)\nof the Act, the proviso to which grants UIDAI\n\nthe power to publish, display or post core biometric information of an individual\n\nfor purposes specified by the regulations. The language of this section is\n\noverbroad and which could lead to transgressions and abuse of power.\n\nMoreover, sub-\nsections 29(1)\nand (2), in effect, create distinction between two\n\nclasses of information (core biometric information and identity information),\n\nwhich are integral to individual identity. Identity information requires equal\n\nprotection as provided to core biometric information.\n\n3 Expansive scope of biometric information\n\n149 Definitions of biometric information [\nSection 2(g)\n], core biometric\n\ninformation [\nSection 2(j)\n] and demographic information [\nSection 2(k)\n] under\n\nthe Aadhaar Act are inclusive and expansive.\nSection 2(g)\ndefines 'biometric\n\ninformation' as “photograph, fingerprint, iris scan, or such other biological\n\nattributes of an individual as may be specified by regulations”.\nSection 2(j)\n\ndefines ‘core biometric information’ as “fingerprint, Iris scan, or such other\nSection 29(4)\nstates: “No Aadhaar number or core biometric information collected or created under this Act in\nrespect of an Aadhaar number holder shall be published, displayed or posted publicly, except for the purposes\nas may be specified by regulations.”\nPART F\n\nbiological attribute of an individual as may be specified by regulations”.\n\nSection 2(t)\nexplains that the regulations are to be made by UIDAI, which is\n\nthe supreme authority under the Act.\nSections 2(g)\n, (j), (k) and (t) give\n\ndiscretionary power to UIDAI to define the scope of biometric and\n\ndemographic information. Although the Act specifically provides what\n\ninformation can be collected, it does not specifically prohibit the collection of\n\nfurther biometric information. The scope of what can, in addition, be collected,\n\nhas been left to regulations. These provisions empower UIDAI to expand on\n\nthe nature of information already collected at the time of enrolment, to the\n\nextent of also collecting ‘such other biological attributes’ that it may deem fit by\n\nspecifying it in regulations at a future date.\n\nThe definitions of these sections provide the government with unbridled\n\npowers to add to the list of biometric details that UIDAI can require a citizen to\n\npart with during enrolment which might even amount to an invasive collection\n\nof biological attributes including blood and urine samples of individuals.\n\n4 Other concerns regarding the Aadhaar Act: Misconceptions\nregarding the efficacy of biometric information\n\n150 The uniqueness of a fingerprint in forensic science remains an\n\nassumption without watertight proof. The uniqueness of biometric data is not\n\nabsolute, it is relative. Not everyone will have a particular biometric trait, or an\n\nindividual’s biometric trait may be significantly different from the ‘normal’\nPART F\n\nexpected trait. Some people may be missing fingerprints due to skin or other\n\ndisease, which may cause further problems when enrolling a large population\n\nin a fingerprint-based register. Discrimination concerns may also be raised in\n\nsuch a case. Therefore, a large scale biometric scheme will usually need to\n\nutilise more than one biometric. For example- both fingerprint and face to\n\nensure all people can be enrolled.254\n\nThe stability of even so called stable types of biometric data is not absolute.\n\nEach time an individual places a fingerprint on a fingerprint reader, the pattern\n\nmay appear to be the same from a short distance, but there are actually small\n\ndifferences in the pattern due to dryness, moisture and elasticity of the skin.\n\nMoreover, cuts and scratches can alter the pattern. Similarly, even the iris, a\n\npopular biometric measurement suffers from difficulties in obtaining a valid\n\nimage. The iris can also be hindered by specula reflections in uncontrolled\n\nlighting situations. These problems also apply to other relatively stable\n\nbiometric identifiers.255\n\n151 Sections 6256 and 31(2)257 of the Aadhaar Act place an additional onus\n\non individual Aadhaar holders to update their information. These provisions\n\n254Ramesh Subramanian, Computer Security, Privacy & Politics: Current Issues, Challenges & Solutions, IRM\nPress, at pages 99-100\n255Ibid, at page 100\n256Section 6 states: “The Authority may require Aadhaar number holders to update their demographic information\n\nand biometric information, from time to time, in such manner as may be specified by regulations, so as to\nensure continued accuracy of their information in the Central Identities Data Repository.”\n257Section 31(2) states: “In case any biometric information of Aadhaar number holder is lost or changes\n\nsubsequently for any reason, the Aadhaar number holder shall request the Authority to make necessary\nalteration in his record in the Central Identities Data Repository in such manner as may be specified by\nregulations.”\nPART F\n\ncreate a legal mandate on individuals to ensure that their information is\n\naccurate within the CIDR. It is an acknowledgement that an individual’s\n\nbiometric information may change from time to time. Natural factors like\n\nageing, manual labour, injury and illness can cause an individual’s biometric\n\ninformation to be altered over the course of a lifetime. Critics of the Aadhaar\n\nprogram however point to the fact that provisions for updation fly in the face of\n\nUIDAI’s repeated advertisements that Aadhaar enrolment is a “one-time”\n\naffair, as it is not and will never be. Moreover, there is no way in which a\n\nperson can estimate that he or she is due for an update, as this is not\n\nsomething that can be discerned by actions as innocuous as looking in the\n\nmirror or at one’s fingers, and therefore there remains no objective means of\n\ncomplying with the above sections. In fact, an authentication failure and a\n\nsubsequent denial of welfare benefits, a subsidy or a service that an individual\n\nis entitled to might be the only way one comes to the conclusion that his or her\n\nbiometrics need to be updated in the CIDR.258\n\nMoreover, since the promise of Aadhaar as a unique identity hinges on the\n\nuniqueness of biometrics, it would be logical to assume that any update to\n\nbiometric data should go through the same rigour as a new enrolment.\n\nRegulation 19(a)\n, entitled ‘Modes of Updating Residents Information’ under\n\nChapter IV of the Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016\n\nprovides:\n\n258 L. Vishwanath, Four Reasons You Should Worry About Aadhaar's Use of Biometrics, The Wire (28 March,\n2017), available at https://thewire.in/rights/real-problem-aadhaar-lies-biometrics\nPART F\n\n“19. Mode of Updating Residents Information:\n\na) At any enrolment centre with the assistance of the operator\nand/or supervisor. The resident will be biometrically\nauthenticated and shall be required to provide his Aadhaar\nnumber along with the identity information sought to be\nupdated.”\n\nThis raises the question as to how an individual will update his/her biometric\n\ninformation. If the biometric information stored in CIDR has changed, the\n\npresent biometrics will lead to mismatch during authentication. This\n\nRegulation does not provide any real clarity on how updation should be taking\n\nplace in practice for the following reasons:\n\n1. As required by the regulation, can an individual be asked to undergo\n\nbiometric authentication, when the purpose is to update the biometrics?\n\n2. Does the provision amount to an implied expectation that an individual is\n\nsupposed to revisit the enrolment centre before all ten fingers and two\n\nirises (core biometric information) are rendered inaccurate for the\n\npurposes of authentication?259\n\nThis is also evidence of the fact that an Aadhaar enrolment is not a one-time\n\naffair.\n\n5 No access to biometric records in database\n\n152 The proviso to Section 28(5)260 of the Aadhaar Act disallows an\n\nindividual access to the biometric information that forms the core of his or her\n\n259 Ibid.\nSection 28(5)\nstates: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, and\nsave as otherwise provided in this Act, the Authority or any of its officers or other employees or any agency\nPART F\n\nunique ID (Aadhaar). The lack of access is problematic for the following\n\nreasons: First, verification of whether the biometrics have been recorded\n\ncorrectly or not in the first place is not possible. This becomes critical when\n\nthat same information forms the basis of identity and is the basis of\n\nauthentication and subsequent access to welfare benefits and other services.\n\nSecond, there is a great potential for fraudulently replacing a person’s\n\nbiometric identity in the database, as the individual has no means to verify the\n\nbiometric information that has been recorded at the time of enrolment. Even\n\nan entity like the enrolment operator (with a software hack) could upload\n\nsomeone else’s biometrics against another person.261 Denial of access to the\n\nindividual violates a fundamental principle of data protection: ownership of the\n\ndata must at all times vest with the individual. Overlooking this fundamental\n\nprinciple is manifestly arbitrary and violative of\nArticle 14.\n\n6 Biometric locking\n\n153 Authentication Regulations 11 (1) and (4) provide for the facility of\n\nBiometric Locking.\nRegulation 11(1)\nprovides:\n\n“The Authority may enable an Aadhaar number holder to\npermanently lock his biometrics and temporarily unlock it\nwhen needed for biometric authentication.”\n\nthat maintains the Central Identities Data Repository shall not, whether during his service or thereafter, reveal\nany information stored in the Central Identities Data Repository or authentication record to anyone:\n\nProvided that an Aadhaar number holder may request the Authority to provide access to his identity information\nexcluding his core biometric information in such manner as may be specified by regulations.”\n261 L. Vishwanath, Four Reasons You Should Worry About Aadhaar's Use of Biometrics, The Wire (28 March,\n\n2017), available at https://thewire.in/rights/real-problem-aadhaar-lies-biometrics\nPART F\n\nRegulation 11(4)\nprovides:\n\n“The Authority may make provisions for Aadhaar number\nholders to remove such permanent locks at any point in a\nsecure manner.”\n\nThe provision allowing biometric locking is salutary to the extent that it allows\n\nAadhaar number holders to permanently lock their biometrics and temporarily\n\nunlock them only when needed for biometric authentication. But the regulation\n\nis problematic to the extent that it also empowers the UIDAI to make\n\nprovisions to remove such locking without any specified grounds for doing\n\nso.262\n\n7 Key takeaways\n\n154 The use of biometric technology is only likely to grow dramatically both\n\nin the private and public sector. On our part, we can only ensure that the\n\nstrides made in technology are accompanied by stringent legal and technical\n\nsafeguards so that biometrics do not become a threat to privacy.263\n\n155 There is no unique concept of privacy and there maybe trade-offs\n\nbetween privacy and other objectives.264 The challenge regarding privacy is\n\nbest put in the following words:\n\n262 The Centre for Internet & Society, Analysis of Key Provisions of the Aadhaar Act Regulations, (31 March,\n2017), available at https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/analysis-of-key-provisions-of-aadhaar-act-\n\nregulations.\n\n263 A.

One size may not fit all countries, regions, or cultures\nwhen it comes to privacy or to some elements of privacy. In\naddition, views of privacy change as time passes and\ntechnology advances. However, different perspectives are not\na barrier to evaluating privacy but a challenge.”265\n\nThe relationship between biometrics and privacy is completely shaped by the\n\ndesign of the systems and the framework within which private and personal\n\ndata is handled. Unfortunately, particularly in developing countries the\n\nadoption of biometrics has not been accompanied by an adequate discussion\n\nof privacy concerns.266 Biometrics can also be a “staunch friend of privacy”\n\nwhen the technology is used for controlling access and to restrict unauthorized\n\npersonnel from gaining access to sensitive personal information. 267 While\n\nevaluating privacy consequences of biometric technology, it is also important\n\nto bear in mind that there cannot be an assumption that current privacy\n\nprotections which may be appropriate for the present state of technology will\n\nalso be sufficient in the future.268 Technology will continue to develop as will\n\nthe need to develop corresponding privacy protections. Concerns around\n\nprivacy and data protection will have to be addressed. “Fair Information\n\nPractices (FIPs), Privacy by Design (PbD), and Privacy Impact Assessments\n\n(PIAs)”269 might be useful in addressing these concerns. FIPs offer the\n\nsubstantive content for a privacy policy. PbD offers a proactive approach to\n\n265 Ibid\n266 Ibid\n267John D Woodward, Biometrics: Identifying Law & Policy Concerns, in Biometrics (AK Jain A.K, R Bolle, and S\n\nPankanti eds.), Springer (1996)\n268Robert Gellman, Privacy and Biometric ID Systems: An Approach Using Fair Information Practices for\n\nDeveloping Countries, CGD Policy Paper 028 Washington DC: Centre for Global Development (1 August,\n2013), available at https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/privacy-and-biometric-ID-systems_0.pdf\n269Ibid\nPART F\n\nthe protection of privacy that relies on advance planning rather responding to\n\nproblems after they arise. PIAs offer a formal way to consider and assess the\n\nprivacy consequences of technology or other choices, including consideration\n\nof alternatives early in the planning stages. These three methodologies are\n\nnot mutually exclusive and can be combined to achieve the just and optimal\n\nresult for society.270\n\n156 Of particular significance is the “Do Not Harm” principle which means\n\nthat biometrics and digital identity should not be used by the issuing authority,\n\ntypically a government, or adjacent parties to serve purposes that could harm\n\nthe individuals holding the identification.271 Identity systems, whether in paper\n\nor digital, must work for the public good and must do no harm. However,\n\nidentity systems due to their inherent power, can cause harm when placed\n\ninto hostile hands and used improperly. Great care must be taken to prevent\n\nthis misuse. “Do No Harm” requires rigorous evaluation, foresight, and\n\ncontinual oversight.272\n\n157 There are many adversarial actors – from private espionage groups to\n\nforeign governments, who may try to exploit data vulnerabilities. There is also\n\nthe threat of abuse of power by future governments. However, creating and\n\ninstilling strong privacy protection laws and safeguards may decrease these\n\n270 Ibid\n271Pam Dixon, A Failure to Do No Harm – India’s Aadhaar biometric ID program and its inability to protect privacy\nin relation to measures in Europe and the U.S., Health and Technology, Vol. 7 (2017), at pages 539–567\n272 Ibid\nPART G\n\nrisks- such as the framework provided by the EUGDPR273. In order to uphold\n\ndemocratic values, the government needs to curtail its own powers concerning\n\nthe tracking of all citizens and prevent the needless collection of data. Such\n\nprotections may assuage the fears and uphold the long-term legitimacy of\n\nAadhaar. If the legislative process takes into account public feedback and\n\naddresses the privacy concerns regarding Aadhaar, it would provide a solid\n\nbasis for more digital initiatives, which are imminent in today’s digital age.\n\nHowever, in its current form, the Aadhaar framework does not address the\n\nprivacy concerns issues discussed in this section of the judgment.\n\nG Legitimate state aim\n\nG.I Directive Principles\n\n158 The Union government has contended that the legitimate state interest\n\nin pursuing the Aadhaar project flows from the solicitous concern shown in the\n\ntext and spirit of the Constitution for realising socio-economic rights. The right\n\nto food must, according to the view proposed before the Court, trump over the\n\nright to privacy. The Aadhaar project, it has been urged, seeks to fulfil socio-\n\neconomic entitlements.\n\n159 The Constituent Assembly did not work in a vacuum. The idealism with\n\nwhich the members of the Assembly drafted the Constitution was the result of\n\n273 General Data Protection Regulation, available at https://gdpr-info.eu/\nPART G\n\nthe “social content of the Independence movement”274, which came from the\n\nawareness of the members about the existing conditions of the Indian\n\nmasses. Granville Austin has therefore referred to the Constitution as a “social\n\ndocument” and a “modernizing force”, whose provisions reflect “humanitarian\n\nsentiments”.275 The Constitution was the medium through which the nascent\n\nIndian democracy was to foster many goals. Austin observes:\n\n“Transcendent among [the goals] was that of social\nrevolution. Through this revolution would be fulfilled the\nbasic needs of the common man, and, it was hoped, this\nrevolution would bring about fundamental changes in the\nstructure of Indian society.”276 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nAustin has further observed:\n\n“The first task of [the] Assembly… [was] to free India through\na new constitution, to feed the starving people, and to clothe\nthe naked masses, and to give every Indian the fullest\nopportunity to develop himself according to his capacity.”277\n\nIn his work titled “The Constitution of India: A Contextual Analysis”, Arun K\n\nThiruvengadam identified one such goal of the Constitution as follows:\n\n“The Indian Constitution sought to lay the blueprint for\neconomic development of the vast subcontinental nation,\nwhich was an imperative for a populace that was largely\nilliterate, poor and disproportionately situated in rural societies\nthat had limited access to many essential social goods and\ninfrastructural facilities.278”\n.\n\n“By establishing these positive obligations of the state, the\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly made it the\nresponsibility of future Indian governments to find a middle\nway between individual liberty and the public good,\n\n274 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1999) at page xxii\n275 Ibid, at pages 62, xiii and xxii\n276 Ibid, at page xxi\n277 Ibid, at page 32\n278 Arun K Thiruvengadam, The Constitution of India: A Contextual Analysis, (Bloomsbury 2017), at page 1\nPART G\n\nbetween preserving the property and the privilege of the\nfew and bestowing benefits on the many in order to\nliberate ‘the powers of all men equally for contributions\nto the common good’.”279 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n160 The draftpersons of the Constitution believed that the driving force to\n\nbring social change rested with the State. This is evident from an instance\n\nduring the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly. Dr. B R Ambedkar had\n\nsubmitted to the Assembly a social scheme to be incorporated into the\n\nConstitution, which included provisions to cover every adult Indian by life\n\ninsurance. However, his social scheme was rejected on the ground that such\n\nprovisions should be left to legislation and need not be embodied into the\n\nConstitution.280\n\n161 The social and economic goals which were contemplated at the time of\n\nIndependence remain at the forefront of the State’s agenda even today.\n\nCertain parts of the Constitution play a leading role in declaring the blueprint\n\nof its social intent. Directive Principles were specifically incorporated into the\n\nConstitution for this purpose. Though not enforceable in courts, the principles\n\nare “fundamental in the governance of the country” and it is the duty of the\n\nState to apply these principles while making laws.281 The essence of the\n\nDirective Principles lies in\nArticle 38\nof the Constitution, which places an\n\nobligation on the State to secure a social order for the promotion of the\n\n279 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1999) at page 66\n280 Ibid, at page 99\nArticle 37\n, The Constitution of India\nPART G\n\nwelfare of the people. Titled as Part IV of the Constitution, the Directive\n\nPrinciples are symbolic of the welfare vision of the Constitution makers.\n\nArticle 38\nof the Constitution provides that :\n\n“(1) The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people\nby securing and protecting as effectively as it may a\nsocial order in which justice, social economic and political,\nshall inform all the institutions of the national life.\n\n(2) The State shall, in particular, strive to minimize the\ninequalities in income, and endeavor to eliminate\ninequalities in status, facilities and opportunities, not only\namongst individuals but also amongst groups of people\nresiding in different areas or engaged in different\nvocations.”\n\nClauses (b), (c), (e) and (f) of\nArticle 39\nprovide thus :\n\n“39. The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards\nsecuring -\n\n...\n\n(b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of\nthe community are so distributed as best to subserve the\ncommon good;\n\n(c) that the operation of the economic system does not result\nin the concentration of wealth and means of production to\nthe common detriment;\n\n..\n\n(e) that the health and strength of workers, men and women,\nand the tender age of children are not abused and that\ncitizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter\navocations unsuited to their age or strength;\n\n(f) that children are given opportunities and facilities to\ndevelop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom\nand dignity and that childhood and youth are protected\nagainst exploitation and against moral and material\nabandonment.”\n\nArticle 41\nspeaks of the right to work, to education, and to public assistance :\n\n“41. The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity\nand development, make effective provision for securing the\nright to work, to education and to public assistance in cases\nPART G\n\nof unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in\nother cases of undeserved want.”\n\nArticle 43\ncontemplates a living wage and conditions of work which provide a\n\ndecent standard of life:\n\n“43. The State shall endeavour to secure, by suitable\nlegislation or economic organisation or in any other way, to all\nworkers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work, a living\nwage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life\nand full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural\nopportunities and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to\npromote cottage industries on an individual or co-operative\nbasis in rural areas.”\n\nArticle 47\ncasts a positive obligation upon the State to raise the level of\n\nnutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health, as among its\n\nprimary duties. Reflecting a constitutional vision of socio-economic justice, the\n\nvalues adopted in the Directive Principles are to be progressively realised in\n\nthe course of social and economic development.\n\n162 In a recently published book titled “Supreme Court of India: The\n\nBeginnings”, George H Gadbois, Jr. observes that the Indian Constitution,\n\n“easily the lengthiest fundamental law in the world, probably ranks also as one\n\nof the most eclectic ever produced”.282 Reflecting upon the constitutional\n\nmodels from which the draftspersons of India’s Constitution drew sustenance,\n\nGadbois states:\n\n“The Constitution makes provision for a parliamentary system\nadapted from the British model, a federation patterned after\nthe\nGovernment of India Act\nof 1935 and the Canadian\n\n282George H Gadbois, JR, Supreme Court of India: The Beginnings (Vikram Raghavan and Vasujith Ram eds.),\nOxford University Press (2017), at page 193\nPART G\n\nConstitution, a set of emergency powers similar to those set\nforth in the Weimar Constitution, a lengthy list of fundamental\nrights adapted from the American experience with a Bill of\nRights, a Supreme Court endowed with express powers of\njudicial review for which the American Supreme Court served\nas the model, and list of “Directive Principles of State Policy”\npatterned after the Constitution of Eire.”283\n\nReflecting on the Directive Principles, Gadbois observes:\n\n“Suffice to say that the directive principles have provided the\nconstitutional basis and justification for the Government’s\nefforts to establish a welfare state, or, to use the designation\npreferred by Indian leaders, a “socialist pattern of society”.284\n\nThe sanction behind the Directives, according to him “is political and not\n\njuridical”. On the other hand, the fundamental rights are justiciable because\n\nArticle 13\nprovides that a law which takes them away or abridges them will be\n\nvoid. The conflict as Gadbois sees it is this:\n\n“the directive principles are a set of instructions to the\nGovernment of the day to legislate into being a welfare state,\nwhich means, of course, an emphasis on the social and\neconomic uplift of the community at large and a\ncorresponding subtraction from individual rights. It is the duty\nof the Government to apply these principles in making laws.\nIn short, the Constitution confers upon the Supreme Court the\ntask of making the fundamental rights meaningful against\npossible infringements by the legislatures and executives,\nand makes it obligatory for the Government to bring about\nchanges in the social and economic life of the nation,\nchanges which were bound to affect adversely some private\nrights.\n\nIt is conceivable at least, that both the Supreme Court and the\nGovernment could have pursued their respective tasks\nwithout conflict, but this did not happen. The legislatures,\npurporting to be doing no more than carrying out the duties\nprescribed in the directive principles, enacted legislation\nwhich the Supreme Court found to be in conflict with some of\nthe fundamental rights.”285\n\n283 Ibid, at pages 193-194\n284 Ibid, at page 195\n285 Ibid, at pages 195-196\nPART G\n\nThis formulation by Gadbois formed part of a dissertation in April 1965. The\n\nevolution of jurisprudence in India since then has altered the Constitutional\n\ndialogue. Over time, the values enshrined in the Directive Principles have\n\nbeen read into the guarantees of freedom in Part III. In incremental stages, the\n\nrealisation of economic freedom has been brought within the realm of\n\njusticiability, at least as a measure of the reasonableness of legislative\n\nprogrammes designed to achieve social welfare.\n\n163 As our constitutional jurisprudence has evolved, the Directive Principles\n\nhave been recognised as being more than a mere statement of desirable\n\ngoals. By a process of constitutional interpretation, the values contained in\n\nthem have been adopted as standards of reasonableness to expand the\n\nmeaning and ambit of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the\n\nConstitution.286 In doing so, judicial interpretation has attempted to imbue a\n\nsubstantive constitutional content to the international obligations assumed by\n\nIndia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International\n\nCovenant on Economic and Social and Cultural Rights. Eradicating extreme\n\npoverty and hunger is a significant facet of the Millennium Development Goals\n\nof the United Nations. Social welfare legislation is but a step to achieve those\n\ngoals. The enactment of the\nNational Food Security Act\n2013 constituted a\n\nmilestone in legislative attempts to provide food security at the household\n\nlevel.\nThe Act\ndiscerns a targeted Public Distribution System for providing\n\nfood-grains to those below the poverty line. The rules contemplated in\nSection\nMinerva Mills Ltd. v Union of India\n, (1980) 3 SCC 625\nPART G\n\n12(2)(b), incorporate the application of Information and Communication\n\nTechnology tools to ensure transparency of governance and prevent a\n\ndiversion of benefits. Another important piece of legislation has been the\n\nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) Act\n\n2005 which was enacted for the enhancement of livelihood and security of\n\nrural households.\nThe Act\nguarantees a hundred days of wage employment in\n\nevery financial year to at least one able-bodied member of every household in\n\nrural areas in public works programmes designed to create public assets.\n\nBoth the National Food Security Act\n2013 and the\nMGNREGA Act\n2005 follow\n\na rights-based approach in dealing with endemic problems of poverty and\n\ndeprivation in rural areas. Leveraging Aadhaar for biometric identification of\n\nbeneficiaries, it has been argued by the respondents, is an intrinsic part of the\n\nlegislative effort to ensure that benefits in terms of food security and\n\nemployment guarantee are channelised to those for whom they are meant.\n\nG.2 Development and freedom\n\n164 Many scholars have delved into the substantive themes of the Indian\n\nConstitution. Upendra Baxi has argued that the Indian Constitution has four\n\nsovereign virtues: “rights, justice, development, and governance”287. Baxi\n\nnotes that they are “intertwined and interlocked with the rest and, in\n\ncontradictory combination/recombinations with both the constitutional and\n\n287Upendra Baxi, “A known but an indifferent judge”: Situating Ronald Dworkin in contemporary Indian\njurisprudence, International Journal of Constitutional Law, (2003) at page 582\nPART G\n\nsocial past and their future images”.288 Development is a leading aspect of our\n\nconstitutional vision. Development in the constitutional context is not only\n\neconomic development assessed in terms of conventional indicators such as\n\nthe growth of the gross domestic product or industrial output. The central\n\nexercise of development in a constitutional sense is addressing the\n\n“deprivation, destitution and oppression”289 that plague an individual’s life.\n\n165 In a traditional sense, freedom and liberty mean an absence of\n\ninterference by the state into human affairs. Liberty assumes the character of\n\na shield. The autonomy of the individual is protected from encroachment by\n\nthe state. This formulation of political rights reflects the notion that the state\n\nshall not be permitted to encroach upon a protected sphere reserved for\n\nindividual decisions and choices. What the state is prevented from doing is\n\ncouched in a negative sense. Civil and political rights operate as restraints on\n\nstate action. They postulate a restriction on the state. Isaiah Berlin formulates\n\nthe negative conception of liberty thus:\n\n“I am … free to the degree to which no man or body of man\ninterferes with my activity. Political liberty is simply the area\nwithin which a man can act unobstructed by others.”290\n\n166 Individual freedom, in this conception, imposes a duty of restraint on the\n\nstate. Modern ideas of neo liberalism have funnelled this notion. Neo-\n\nliberalism postulates that the increasing presence of the state is a threat to\n\n288 Ibid\n289 Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page xii\n290 Isaiah Berlin, Two Concepts of Liberty, available at\n\nhttp://faculty.www.umb.edu/steven.levine/courses/Fall%202015/What%20is%20Freedom%20Writings/Berlin.p\ndf\nPART G\n\nindividual autonomy. A free market economy with minimum state control, in\n\nthis view, is regarded as integral to protecting individual rights and freedoms.\n\nFA Hayek construes the content of liberty as meaning the absence of\n\nobstacles. Resultantly, this notion of liberty regards the role of the state in a\n\nnarrow jurisprudential frame. Attempts by the state to pursue social justice or\n\nto use its authority for redistribution of wealth would in this conception not be a\n\nlegitimate use of state power.291\n\n167 The notion that liberty only consists of freedom from restraint does not\n\ncomplete the universe of its discourse. Broader notions of liberty are cognizant\n\nof the fact that individuals must be enabled to pursue their capacities to the\n\nfullest degree. Social and economic discrimination poses real barriers to\n\naccess education, resources and the means to a dignified life. This approach\n\nto understanding the content of freedom construes the ability to lead a\n\ndignified existence as essential to the conception of liberty and freedom. The\n\nintegral relationship between removal of socio-economic inequality and\n\nfreedom has been eloquently set out by Amartya Sen in “Development as\n\nFreedom”292:\n\n“Development requires the removal of major sources of\nunfreedom: poverty as well as tyranny, poor economic\nopportunities as well as systematic social deprivation, neglect\nof public facilities as well as intolerance or overactivity of\nrepressive states. Despite unprecedented increases in\noverall opulence, the contemporary world denies elementary\nfreedoms to vast numbers – perhaps even the majority-of\npeople. Sometimes the lack of substantive freedoms relates\ndirectly to economic poverty, which robs people of the\n\n291 F A Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, Routledge & Kegan Paul, (1960) at pages 11, 207-208\n292 Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000) at page 3-4\nPART G\n\nfreedom to satisfy hunger, or to achieve sufficient nutrition, or\nto obtain remedies for treatable illnesses, or the opportunity to\nbe adequately clothed or sheltered, or to enjoy clean water or\nsanitary facilities. In other cases, the unfreedom links closely\nto the lack of public facilities and social care, such as the\nabsence of epidemiological programs, or of organized\narrangements for health care or educational facilities, or of\neffective institutions for the maintenance of local peace and\norder. In still other cases, the violation of freedom results\ndirectly from a denial of political and civil liberties by\nauthoritarian regimes and from imposed restrictions on the\nfreedom to participate in the social, political and economic life\nof the community.”\n\nIn Sen’s analysis, human development is influenced by economic\n\nopportunities, political liberties, social powers, and the enabling conditions of\n\ngood health, basic education, and the encouragement and cultivation of\n\ninitiatives. Taking it further, Sen has recognized an important co-relation in\n\nterms of the non-availability of basic economic conditions:\n\n“Economic unfreedom, in the form of extreme poverty, can\nmake a person a helpless prey in the violation of other kinds\nof freedom… Economic unfreedom can breed social\nunfreedom, just as social or political unfreedom can also\nfoster economic unfreedom.”293\n\n168 The notion of freedom as an agency has been developed by Sen as\n\npart of the ‘capability theory’. The necessary consequence of focusing upon\n\nmajor sources of unfreedom, in a social and economic perspective, is that the\n\nremoval of these restraints is essential to the realization of freedom. If true\n\nfreedom is to be achieved through the removal of conditions which cause\n\nsocial and economic deprivation, the role of the state is not confined to an\n\nabsence of restraint. On the contrary, the state has a positive obligation to\n\n293 Ibid, at page 8\nPART G\n\nenhance individual capabilities. Martha Nussbaum294 argues that realising\n\nfreedom requires the state to discharge positive duties. Nussbaum expresses\n\na threshold level of capability below which true human functioning is not\n\navailable. Freedom is seen in terms of human development and is the process\n\nby which individuals can rise above capability thresholds. In the realisation of\n\nbasic rights, the state is subject to positive duties to further the fulfilment of\n\nfreedom.\n\n169 The broader conception of freedom and liberty which emerges from the\n\nwritings of Sen and Nussbaum has direct consequences upon how we view\n\ncivil and political rights and socio-economic rights. The distinction between\n\nthe two sets of rights becomes illusory once civil and political rights are\n\nregarded as comprehending within their sweep a corresponding duty to take\n\nsuch measures as would achieve true freedom. Henry Shue295 suggests that\n\nrights give rise to corresponding duties. These duties include:\n\n(i) a duty to respect;\n\n(ii) a duty to protect; and\n\n(iii) a duty to fulfil.\n\nDuties of respect embody a restraint on affecting the rights of others. Duties\n\nto protect mandate that the state must restrain others in the same manner as\n\nit restrains itself. The state’s duty of non-interference extends to private\n\nindividuals. The duty to fulfil connotes aiding the deprived in the realisation of\n\n294Martha Nussbaum, Women and Human Development, Cambridge University Press, (2000)\n295Henry Shue, Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence and US Foreign Policy, Princeton University Press, Second\nEdition (1996)\nPART G\n\nrights. This imposes a corresponding duty to create the conditions which will\n\nfacilitate the realisation of the right. The right which is protected for the\n\nindividual will also signify an expectation that the state must create institutions\n\nenabling the exercise of facilitative measures or programmes of action, of an\n\naffirmative nature. The state has affirmative obligations to fulfil in the\n\nrealisation of rights. These positive duties of the state are readily apparent in\n\nthe context of welfare entitlements when the state must adopt affirmative\n\nsteps to alleviate poverty and the major sources of economic and social non-\n\nfreedom. But the thesis of Nussbaum and Shue have an important role for the\n\nstate to discharge in ensuring the fulfilment of political rights as well. In a\n\nhighly networked and technology reliant world, individual liberty requires the\n\nstate to take positive steps to protect individual rights. Data protection and\n\nindividual privacy mandate that the state put in place a positive regime which\n\nrecognises, respects and protects the individual from predatory market places.\n\nThe state has a positive duty to create an autonomous regulatory framework\n\nin which the individual has access to remedies both against state and non-\n\nstate actors, both of whom pose grave dangers of assault on the individual as\n\nan autonomous entity. Failure to discharge that duty is a failure of the state to\n\nrespect, protect and fulfil rights.\n\nDr Ambedkar’s prophetic final address to the Constituent Assembly elaborates\n\nthat vision:\n\n“On the social plane, we have in India a society based on the\nprinciple of graded inequality with elevation for some and\ndegradation for others. On the economic plane, we have a\nsociety in which there are some who have immense wealth as\nagainst many who live in abject poverty. On the 26th of\nPART G\n\nJanuary 1950, we are going to enter into a life of\ncontradictions. In politics we will have equality and in social\nand economic life we will have inequality...How long shall we\ncontinue to live this life of contradictions? How long shall we\ncontinue to deny equality in our social and economic life? If\nwe continue to deny it for long, we will do so only by putting\nour political democracy in peril. We must remove this\ncontradiction at the earliest possible moment or else those\nwho suffer from inequality will blow up the structure of political\ndemocracy which [this] Assembly has [so] laboriously built\nup.”296\n\nThe pursuit of social welfare and security is a central aspect of development.\n\nThe State, in Ambedkar’s vision, would be the main instrumentality in the\n\ndebate on development, which has to revolve around the social, economic\n\nand political spheres and would be guided by the values of the Constitution.\n\n170 Social opportunities are the facilities and “arrangements that society\n\nmakes” for education, healthcare and nutrition, which “influence the\n\nindividual’s substantive freedom to live better”.297 Social security measures\n\ninclude programmes which intend to promote the welfare of the population\n\nthrough assistance measures guaranteeing access to sufficient resources.\n\nThe social security framework is not only important for individual\n\ndevelopment, but also for effective participation in economic and political\n\nactivities. Social security programmes flow from ‘economic and social rights’−\n\nalso called as “welfare rights” 298\n\nor second generation rights. These rights,\n\nrecognized for the first time under the Universal Declaration on Human\n\nRights, 1948 include a large list of freedoms and claims under its “protective\n\n296 Constituent Assembly Debates (25 November 1949)\n297 Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page 39\n298 Amartya Sen, The Idea of Justice, Penguin (2009) at pages 379-380\nPART G\n\numbrella”. They include not only basic political rights, but the right to work, the\n\nright to education, protection against unemployment and poverty, the right to\n\njoin trade unions and even the right to just and favourable remuneration. 299\n\nSocial security programmes as an instrument for the removal of global poverty\n\nand other economic and social deprivations are at the centre stage in the\n\nglobal discourse.\nArticle 22\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nexpressly recognises that every member of society is entitled to the right to\n\nsocial security and to the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nThose rights are stated to be indispensable for dignity and to the free\n\ndevelopment of personality. The realisation of these rights has to be facilitated\n\nboth through national efforts and international co-operation and in accordance\n\nwith the organisation and the resources of each state.\nArticle 22\nstipulates\n\nthat:\n\n“Article 22\nEveryone, as a member of society, has the right to social\nsecurity and is entitled to realization, through national effort\nand international co-operation and in accordance with the\norganization and resources of each State, of the economic,\nsocial and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the\nfree development of his personality.”\n\nIn a similar vein,\nArticle 23\ncomprehends a conglomeration of rights including\n\n(i) the right to work; (ii) free choice of employment; (iii) just and favourable\n\nconditions of work; (iv) protection against unemployment; (v) equal pay for\n\nequal work without any discrimination; (vi) just and favourable remuneration\n\nfor work; and (vii) formation and membership of trade unions.\nArticle 23\n\n299 Ibid, at page 380\nPART G\n\nconstrues these rights as a means of ensuring both for the individual and the\n\nfamily, an “existence worthy of human dignity” supplemented if necessary “by\n\nother means of social protection”.\n\nIndia having adopted the UDHR, its principles can legitimately animate our\n\nconstitutional conversations. Both\nArticles 22\nand\nare significant in\n\nrecognising economic rights and entitlements in matters of work and social\n\nsecurity. Both the articles recognise the intrinsic relationship between human\n\ndignity and the realisation of economic rights. Measures of social protection\n\nare integral to the realisation of economic freedom and to fulfil the aspiration\n\nfor human dignity.\n\n171 India adopted and ratified the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as\n\nwell as the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. India acceded\n\nto the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on 10 April 1979.\n\nAccording to the Preamble, the states who are parties to the Covenant have\n\nrecognized that:\n\n“the ideal of free human beings enjoying freedom from fear\nand want can only be achieved if conditions are created\nwhereby everyone may enjoy his economic, social and\ncultural rights, as well as his civil and political rights.”\n\nFreedom is thus defined in terms of the absence of fear and want. Moreover,\n\nfreedom consists in the enjoyment of a conglomeration of rights: economic,\nPART G\n\nsocial and cultural as well as civil and political rights. There is in other words\n\nno dichotomy between the two sets of rights.\n\nArticle 11\nof the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights imposes\n\npositive obligations on the covenanting states:\n\n“Article 11.\n\n1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the\nright of everyone to an adequate standard of living for\nhimself and his family, including adequate food, clothing\nand housing, and to the continuous improvement of living\nconditions. The States Parties will take appropriate steps\nto ensure the realization of this right, recognizing to this\neffect the essential importance of international\ncooperation based on free consent.\n\n2. The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing\nthe fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger,\nshall take, individually and through international co-\n\noperation, the measures, including specific programmes,\nwhich are needed:\n\n(a) To improve methods of production, conservation and\ndistribution of food by making full use of technical and\nscientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the\nprinciples of nutrition and by developing or reforming\nagrarian systems in such a way as to achieve the most\nefficient development and utilization of natural resources;\n\n(a) Taking into account the problems of both food-importing\nthe food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable\ndistribution of world food supplies in relation to need.”\n\n172 The Masstricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and\n\nCultural Rights (January 1997) stipulate that:\n\n“It is now undisputed that all human rights are indivisible,\ninterdependent, interrelated and of equal importance for\nhuman dignity. Therefore, states are as responsible for\nviolations of economic, social and cultural rights as they are\nfor violations of civil and political rights.”\nPART G\n\nThe Guidelines also stipulate that like civil and political rights, economic,\n\nsocial and cultural rights impose three different types of obligations on states :\n\nthe obligation to respect, protect and fulfil. The guidelines recognize that\n\nviolations of economic, social and cultural rights can occur through acts of\n\ncommission and omission on the part of states. The omission or failure of\n\nstates to take measures emanating from their legal obligations may result in\n\nsuch violations. Among them is the failure to enforce legislation or to put into\n\neffect policies designed to implement the provisions of the Covenant. In\n\nsimilar terms, the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the\n\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights cast\n\naffirmative duties on states to take immediate steps towards realizing the\n\nrights contained in the Covenant. Clauses 16, 21 and 27 of the guidelines are\n\nthus:\n\n“16. All States parties have an obligation to begin\nimmediately to take steps towards full realization of the\nrights contained in the Covenant.\n\n21. The obligation “to achieve progressively the full\nrealization of the rights” requires States parties to move\nas expeditiously as possible towards the realization of\nthe rights. Under no circumstances shall this be\ninterpreted as implying for States the right to defer\nindefinitely efforts to ensure full realization. On the\ncontrary all States parties have the obligation to begin\nimmediately to take steps to fulfil their obligations under\nthe Covenant.\n\n27. In determining whether adequate measures have been\ntaken for the realization of the rights recognized in the\nCovenant attention shall be paid to equitable and\neffective use of and access to the available resources.”\n\nThe office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights notified General\n\nComment No. 3, which was adopted at the fifth session of the Committee on\nPART G\n\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights on 14 December 1990. The Comment\n\nstates:\n\n“…while the full realization of the relevant rights may be\nachieved progressively, steps towards that goal must be\ntaken within a reasonably short time after the Covenant’s\nentry into force for the States concerned. Such steps should\nbe deliberate, concrete and targeted as clearly as possible\ntowards meeting the obligations recognized in the Covenant.”\n\nSimilarly, General Comment No. 12 on the right to adequate food was\n\nadopted at the twentieth session of the Committee on Economic, Social and\n\nCultural Rights on 12 May 1999. It states :\n\n“The Committee observes that while the problems of hunger\nand malnutrition are often particularly acute in developing\ncountries, malnutrition, under-nutrition and other problems\nwhich relate to the right to adequate food and the right to\nfreedom from hunger also exist in some of the most\neconomically developed countries, Fundamentally, the roots\nof the problem of hunger and malnutrition are not lack of food\nbut lack of access to available food, inter alia because of\npoverty, by large segments of the world's population.”\n\nThe emphasis on the lack of access to available food is significant to the\n\npresent discourse. It indicates that access to food requires institutional\n\nmechanisms to ensure that the available resources reach the beneficiaries for\n\nwhom they are intended.\nSection 2(1)(f)\nof the Protection of Human Rights Act 1993 specifically\n\nadverts to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights:\n\n“2.(1)(f) “International Covenants” means the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted\nby the General Assembly of the United Nations on 16th\nDecember, 1996 and such other Covenant or Convention\nPART G\n\nadopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations as\nthe Central Government may, by notification, specify;”\n\nUnder\nSection 12(f)\n, the National Human Rights Commission has been\n\nentrusted with the function of studying treaties and other international\n\ninstruments of human rights and to make recommendations for their effective\n\nimplementation. Parliament has statutorily incorporated India’s obligations at\n\ninternational law under the above covenants as a part of the national effort to\n\nrealise fundamental human freedoms. Achieving economic freedom is integral\n\nto that mission. In his classic work “The Idea of Justice”, Amartya Sen has\n\nobserved in this regard:\n\n“The inclusion of second-generation rights makes it possible\nto integrate ethical issues underlying general ideas of global\ndevelopment with the demands of deliberative democracy,\nboth of which connect with human rights and quite often with\nan understanding of the importance of advancing human\ncapabilities.”300\n\n174 Social security thus acts as an underpinning link with development.\n\nThere is also a two-way relationship between development and social security\n\n(expansion of human capability). Dreze and Sen have dealt with this\n\nrelationship in their following observation:\n\n“Growth generates resources with which public and private\nefforts can be systematically mobilized to expand education,\nhealth care, nutrition, social facilities, and other essentials of\nfuller and freer human life for all. And the expansion of human\ncapability, in turn, allows a faster expansion of resources and\nproduction, on which economic growth ultimately depends…\nWell-functioning public services, especially (but not only) in\nfields such as education and health, are also critical in\nfostering participatory growth as well as in ensuring that\n\n300 Amartya Sen, The Idea of Justice, Penguin (2009) at page 381\nPART G\n\ngrowth leads to rapid improvements in people’s living\nconditions.”301\n\nThe authors have further observed that apart from education and healthcare,\n\nIndia faces larger issues of accountability in the “public sector as a whole”. 302\n\nThe lack of progress in public services acts as a huge barrier to improve the\n\nquality of life of people.303 It has been observed:\n\n“The relative weakness of Indian social policies on school\neducation, basic healthcare, child nutrition, essential land\nreform and gender equity reflects deficiencies of politically\nengaged public reasoning and social pressure, not just\ninadequacies in the official thinking of the government.”304\n\nThe future of Indian democracy therefore depends on how it engages itself\n\nwith the issues of accountability in transfer of basic human facilities to the\n\ncommon man.\n\n175 The State has a legitimate aim to ensure that its citizens receive basic\n\nhuman facilities. In order to witness development, the huge amount of\n\nexpenditure that the State incurs in providing subsidies and benefits to the\n\ncommon citizens, must be accompanied by accountability and transparency.\n\nLegislative and institutional changes are often capable of creating an\n\natmosphere of transparency and accountability. The most visible example of a\n\nlegislative enactment which brought institutional changes is the\nRight to\n\nInformation Act, 2005\n. Commentators have often highlighted the importance\n\n301 Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen, An Uncertain Glory, Penguin (2013), at pages x and xi\n302 Ibid, at page xi\n303 Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen, An Uncertain Glory, Penguin (2013), at page 33\n304 Amartya Sen, The Idea of Justice, Penguin (2009) at page 349\nPART G\n\nof this legislation by deliberating upon how it has been successful at “curbing\n\ncorruption and restoring accountability in public life”305. According to the State,\n\nthough the Aadhaar programme is not in itself a social security programme,\n\nthe institutional framework established by the Act, seeks to act, in a way, as\n\nan extension of social security programmes. The State has a legitimate\n\nconcern to check that the welfare benefits which it marks for those, who are\n\nentitled, reach them without diversion. The Aadhaar programme, it is argued,\n\nacts as an instrument for the realization of the benefits arising out of the social\n\nsecurity programmes. The Aadhaar programme, it was further contended,\n\nfulfils the State’s concern that its resources are utilised fully for human\n\ndevelopment.\n\nIt has been contended by the Respondents that since the establishment of the\n\nUIDAI in 2009, its basic mandate is to provide a unique identity number to\n\nresidents. The number would subserve two purposes. First, it would serve as\n\na proof of identity. Second, it would be used for the purpose of identifying\n\nbeneficiaries for the transfer of social welfare benefits, provided by the state.\n\nThe rationale for establishing a method of identification is to ensure that the\n\nbenefits provided by social welfare programmes formulated by the State reach\n\nthe beneficiaries for whom they are intended. As a policy intervention, a\n\nunique measure of identification is intended, it has been argued, to secure\n\nfinancial inclusion. A significant hurdle in the success of social welfare\n\nprogrammes is that benefits do not reach the targeted population. The reason\n305 Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen, An Uncertain Glory, Penguin (2013), at page 100\nPART G\n\nfor this may have something to do intrinsically with the condition of the\n\nindividuals as much as with their larger socio-economic circumstances.\n\nMigrant labour and labour in the unorganised sector lacks fixity of abode. The\n\nnature of their work renders their lives peripatetic. Nomadic tribes, particularly\n\nin inaccessible areas, may not have fixed homes. In many cases, traditional\n\noccupations require individuals to move from place to place, dependent on\n\nseasonal changes. Then again, groups of citizens including women, children\n\nand the differently abled may face significant difficulties in accessing benefits\n\nunder publicly designed social welfare programmes as a result of factors such\n\nas gender, age and disability.\n\n176 Unequal access to welfare benefits provided by the State becomes a\n\nsignificant source of deprivation resulting in a denial of the means to sustain\n\nlife and livelihood. Before the adoption of Aadhaar based-identity, there were\n\nmultiple platforms for identification of residents. They created a situation\n\nwhere those with no identity had no access to the means of sustaining a\n\ndignified life. Equally significant, as a policy intervention, was the issue of\n\ncapture. While on the one hand, large swathes of the population had no\n\naccess to welfare assistance, benefits could be captured by persons not\n\nentitled to them either by the assertion of fake or multiple identities. Setting up\n\na fake identity enables an individual to pass off as another and to secure a\n\nbenefit to which that individual is not entitled. Fake identities compound the\n\nproblem of capture by allowing individuals to receive multiple benefits through\nPART G\n\nshell identities. Policy makers were confronted with the serious problems\n\nposed by fake and multiple identities since they imposed a burden on the\n\nexchequer while at the same time diluting the efficacy of state designed social\n\nwelfare measures. The burden on the exchequer is illustrated by situations\n\nwhere persons who are not entitled to benefits secure them in the guise of\n\nbeing persons entitled to them. When imposters secure benefits which are\n\nnot meant for them, they deprive in the process, persons who are genuinely\n\nentitled to benefits. The class of beneficiaries of social welfare programmes is,\n\nso to speak, adulterated by the capture of benefits by those not entitled to\n\nthem. This raises serious concerns of the deprivation of human rights. The\n\ncapture of benefits has the consequence of depriving those to whom these\n\nbenefits should legitimately flow, of the measures designed by the state to\n\nprotect its populace from human want and need. The resources deployed by\n\nthe state are from its public revenues. When designing a unique measure of\n\nidentification, the state must be guided by the necessity of ensuring financial\n\ninclusion and of protecting against financial exclusion. Every citizen who is\n\neligible for social welfare benefits should obtain them. No person who is\n\nentitled should be excluded. Individuals who do not qualify for social welfare\n\nbenefits should not capture them by passing off as individuals entitled.\n\nEnforcing and implementing a robust platform for identification of beneficiaries\n\nmust ensure that social welfare benefits reach the hands of those who fulfil the\n\nconditions of eligibility and are not captured by rent-seeking behaviour of\n\nthose to whom social welfare benefits are not designed. This constitutes a\nPART G\n\nlegitimate object of state policy. Reaching out to the targeted population is a\n\nvalid constitutional purpose. Social welfare measures are an intrinsic part of\n\nstate policy designed to facilitate dignified conditions of existence to the\n\nmarginalised, especially those who live below the poverty line. Identification\n\nof beneficiaries is crucial to the fulfilment of social welfare programmes.\n\n177 These concerns form the basis of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of\n\nFinancial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016. As its\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons explains:\n\n“The correct identification of targeted beneficiaries for delivery\nof various subsides, benefits, services, grants, wages and\nother social benefits schemes which are funded from the\nConsolidated Fund of India has become a challenge for the\nGovernment. The failure to establish identity of an individual\nhas proved to be a major hindrance for successful\nimplementation of these programmes. This has been a grave\nconcern for certain categories of persons, such as women,\nchildren, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, migrant\nunskilled and unorganised workers, and nomadic tribes. In\nthe absence of a credible system to authenticate identity of\nbeneficiaries, it is difficult to ensure that the subsidies,\nbenefits and services reach to intended beneficiaries.”\n\nThe Statement of Objects and Reasons indicates that the enactment is\n\ndesigned to ensure “the effective, secure and accurate delivery of benefits,\n\nsubsidies and services from the Consolidated Fund of India to targeted\n\nbeneficiaries”. The architecture of the law contemplates regulating the\n\nfollowing aspects:\n\n“(a) issue of Aadhaar numbers to individuals on providing ..\n\ndemographic and biometric information to the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India;\n\n(b) requiring, Aadhaar numbers for identifying an\nindividual for delivery of benefits, subsidies, and\nPART G\n\nservices (where) the expenditure is incurred from or\nthe receipt therefrom forms part of the Consolidated\nFund of India;\n\n(c) authentication of the Aadhaar number of an Aadhaar\nnumber holder in relation to his demographic and\nbiometric information;\n\n(d) establishment of the Unique Identification Authority of\nIndia… to perform functions in pursuance of the\nobjectives above;\n\n(e) maintenance and updating the information of\nindividuals in the Central Identities Data Repository in\nsuch manner as may be specified by regulations;\n\n(f) measures pertaining to security, privacy and\nconfidentiality of information in possession or control\nof the Authority including information stored in the\nCentral Identities Data Repository; and\n\n(g) offences and penalties for contravention of relevant\nstatutory provisions.”\n\nThe Preamble to the enactment indicates that Parliament designed the\n\nlegislation as an instrument of good governance, to secure an “efficient,\n\ntransparent and targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits and services” for\n\nwhich the expenditure is incurred from the Consolidated Fund to resident\n\nindividuals.\n\n178 The Aadhaar platform is not a social welfare benefit in itself.\n\nEssentially, what it seeks to achieve is to provide a unique identity to every\n\nresident. This identity, in the form of an Aadhaar number, is obtained upon the\n\nsubmission of demographic and biometric information in the course of\n\nenrolment. The legislative design envisages that the identity of the individual is\n\nverified through the process of authentication by which the biometric data\n\nstored in the central repository is matched with the biometric information\n\nsubmitted for authentication. Aadhaar is a platform for verification of identity\nPART G\n\nbased principally on biometric information. In facilitating the process of\n\nestablishing the identity of the individual who seeks social welfare benefits\n\nenvisaged in\nSection 7\n, Aadhaar has an instrumental role. It is instrumental in\n\nthe sense that as a measure of state policy, it seeks to bring about financial\n\ninclusion by providing a means of identification to every segment of the\n\npopulation including those who may not have been within the coverage of\n\ntraditional markers of identity. As an instrument for verifying identity, Aadhaar\n\nseeks to ensure that social welfare benefits are obtained by persons eligible to\n\ndo so and are not captured by the ineligible. Relying on an asserted reliability\n\nof biometric markers, the Aadhaar platform attempts to eliminate, or at least to\n\ncurb rent-seeking behaviour.\n\nThe rationale underlying\nSection 7\nis the targeted delivery of services, benefits\n\nand subsidies which are funded from the Consolidated Fund of India. In the\n\nseven decades since Independence, the Union Government has put into place\n\nsocial welfare measures including the public distribution system, free\n\neducation, scholarships, mid-day meals and LPG subsidies to ameliorate the\n\nconditions of existence of the poor and marginalised. There is a state interest\n\nin ensuring that the welfare benefits which the state provides reach those for\n\nwhom they are intended.\nPART G\n\nG.3 Identity and Identification\n\n179 Identity is inseparable from the human personality. An identity is a\n\nstatement of who an individual is. Our identities define who we are. They\n\nexpress what we would wish the world to know us as. The human personality\n\nis, at a certain level, all about identity, for it is through the assertion of identity\n\nthat each individual seeks to preserve the core of his or her humanity. An\n\nidentity is the persona which an individual puts forth in a multitude of\n\nrelationships. The significance of our identity lies in our ability to express the\n\ncore of our beings. When the Constitution protects our right to be and to be\n\nwhat we are, it creates a space where the individual is immune from\n\ninterference. By recognizing our liberty as autonomous persons, the\n\nConstitution recognizes our ability to preserve and shape our identities in\n\ninteractions with others.\n\nIdentity may be, but is not always based upon immutable characteristics that\n\nare defined at birth. What is immutable may not be or, at any rate, is not\n\ngenerally understood as being capable of change. But even here, the\n\nimmutability of our features is relative to our own existence and is capable of\n\nbeing shaped by the social milieu in which human beings lead their lives.\n\nFeatures about our biological being which are defined at birth are, after all, not\n\nas constraining upon our identities as is often assumed to be the case. That\n\nis because these immutable features are also constantly engaged with our\nPART G\n\nsocial and cultural environment. They shape and are influenced by that\n\nenvironment.\n\n180 There is a distinction between identity and identification. Identification is\n\na matter of proof- of establishing that a person is actually, the individual who\n\nclaims a right or entitlement. In their daily interactions, individuals have to\n\ndistinguish themselves from others, whether it be in the course of\n\nemployment, travel, civil union, location, community perspectives, revenue\n\nobligations or access to benefits. Identification is a proof of identity or\n\nevidence of identity. Identification is mandatory in numerous activities of day\n\nto day life: a passport is necessary for international travel, a voter ID is\n\nrequired for exercising electoral rights, a driving license is necessary to ply a\n\nvehicle and an arms license is needed to possess a fire arm. The holder of a\n\npolicy of medical insurance will have a card depicting his or her identity which\n\nis a proof of holding a valid policy for availing medical benefits.\n\n181 Under international law, recognition of identity is an obligation of a\n\nnation state.\nArticle 6\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides\n\nthat “everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the\n\nlaw”.\nArticle 16\nof the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is in\n\nsimilar terms.\nArticle 8\nof the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child\n\nmandates that State parties undertake to respect the right of the child to\nPART G\n\npreserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations as\n\nrecognized by law without unlawful interference. The importance of identity is\n\nrecognized by\nArticle 3\nof the American Convention on Human Rights. The\n\nInter-American Juridical Committee (IAJC) of the Organisation of American\n\nStates (OAS) has in fact provided that:\n\n“12. The right to identity is consubstantial to the attributes and\nhuman dignity. Consequently it is an enforceable basic\nhuman right erga omnes as an expression of a collective\ninterest of the overall international community that does not\nadmit derogation or suspension in cases provided in the\nAmerican Convention on Human Rights.\n\n…\n\n15. The Committee considers that the right to identity is,\namong its most relevant implications and scope, to constitute\nan autonomous right that is based on the regulations of\ninternational law and those that derive from the actual cultural\nelements considered in the domestic legal systems of the\nStates, in order therefore to satisfy the specificity of the\nindividual, with his or her rights that are unique, singular and\nidentifiable.”306\n\n182 In\nNational Legal Services Authority v Union of India307\n, this Court\n\nheld that gender identity is fundamental to and an essential component for the\n\nenjoyment of civil rights by the transgender community. Self-determination of\n\nidentity has been held to be an essential facet of\nArticle 21.\nIn the view of this\n\nCourt:\n\n“74. The recognition of one's gender identity lies at the heart\nof the fundamental right to dignity. Gender, as already\nindicated, constitutes the core of one's sense of being as well\n\n306 Opinion on the Right to Identity, 2007, available at\nhttp://www.oas.org/en/sla/iajc/docs/ijc_current_agenda_Right_to_Identity.pdf\n307 (2014) 5 SCC 438\nPART G\n\nas an integral part of a person's identity. Legal recognition of\ngender identity is, therefore, part of right to dignity and\nfreedom guaranteed under our Constitution.\n\n75.\nArticle 21\n, as already indicated, guarantees the protection\nof \"personal autonomy\" of an individual.\nIn\nAnuj Garg v. Hotel\nAssociation of India33\n(SCC p. 15, paras 34-35), this Court\nheld that personal autonomy includes both the negative right\nof not to be subject to interference by others and the positive\nright of individuals to make decisions about their life, to\nexpress themselves and to choose which activities to take\npart in. Self-determination of gender is an integral part of\npersonal autonomy and self-expression and falls within the\nrealm of personal liberty guaranteed under\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution of India.”\n\nIdentity assumes a complex character in a networked society. Shah adopts\n\nthe following definition of a networked society308:\n\n“a network society is a society where the key social structures\nand activities are organized around electronically processed\ninformation networks. So it’s not just about networks or social\nnetworks, because social networks have been very old forms\nof social organization. It’s about social networks which\nprocess and manage information and are using micro-\nelectronic based technologies”309.\n\n183 In a networked society, an individual is a data subject and a quantified\n\nself. The individual is a data subject since his or her data is stored in a\n\ndatabase. Shah notes that there is an ambivalence about whether the data\n\nsubject is the individual whose identity becomes the basis of validating the\n\ndata or whether the data subject is the identity of the individual as it gets\n\nconstructed through data sets. The individual becomes a quantified self\n\nwhere data which is distributed across various systems is “curated” to form a\n\ncomprehensive profile of an individual.\n\n308Nishant Shah, Identity and Identification – the Individual in the Time of Networked Governance, Socio Legal\nReview, available at http://www.sociolegalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Identity-and-Identification-\nthe-Individual-in-the-Time-of-Networked-Governance.pdf\n309Manuel Castells, Conversation with Manuel Castells, Globetrotter, available at\n\nhttp://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Castells/castells-con4.html\nPART G\n\n184 The Aadhaar project was intended to allow a unique identity to enable\n\nindividuals to “navigate through disconnected and often hostile governmental\n\ndatabase systems”. Shah notes that ever since 2009, the terms ‘identity’ and\n\n‘identification’ were used as part of the Aadhaar project inter-changeably,\n\nintroducing “a curious conflation and interoperability”310 between these\n\nnotions. ‘Identification’ is the ability of a network device to identify an individual\n\nby scanning unique data sets, from personal information to biometric details\n\nsuch as finger print and iris scan, which would be stored in a massive\n\ncentralized database. UIDAI posited that identification took place through its\n\nyes/no mechanism by which the centralised database would provide a\n\nresponse to whether the biometric details submitted for authentication match\n\nthose in the repository. Technologically, at this level, Aadhaar was to be a\n\nmeans of identification. Yet at another level, the Aadhaar project also\n\noffered itself as providing a documentary identity to persons who may not\n\nhave possessed one at all. Shah, in the course of his article, has this to state\n\nabout the conflation between identity and identification in the Aadhaar project:\n\n“This ambiguity and conflation cannot merely be attributed to\na semantic slip of the keyboard, but to a much larger\nphenomenon which points to the construction of a new notion\nof the individual, through big data streams and measures of\nself-quantification. It offers us a techno-social framework\nwhere the machine function of identification is wedded to the\nhuman expression of identity, and thus offers an inroad into\nlooking at what happens when our identities are mediated,\nmitigated, facilitated, and contained by the ways in which the\nnetworked technologies of authentication and verification\noperate. It is a crucial shift where the identity of a person is\nontologically defined through the logics and logistics of\n\n310Nishant Shah, Identity and Identification – the Individual in the Time of Networked Governance, Socio Legal\nReview, available at http://www.sociolegalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Identity-and-Identification-\nthe-Individual-in-the-Time-of-Networked-Governance.pdf\nPART G\n\nnetworked computation that form the Aadhaar project. This is\nwhy the Aadhaar enrolment system, for instance, does not\ncheck the veracity of the information that the individual gives\nit. For the enrolment, the individual needs no proof to\nsubstantiate or validate the information provided. The name,\nthe address, the description, etc. are empty signifiers and it is\npossible for anybody to assume any identity as long as they\ngive the inviolable data of biometric recognition. Thus, the\nidentity of the person being enrolled and registered is almost\ninsignificant and has value only in how it would now always\nidentify the individual through the credentials or information\nprovided. The Aadhaar network governance system is\nconcerned only with the identifiers rather than the narrative,\niterative, forms of identity and expression, and this is where\nwe begin examining the ways in which identity is shaped,\nunderstood, and used to construct the notion of an individual\nin computation systems.”311\n\n185 Identity includes the right to determine the forms through which identity\n\nis expressed and the right not to be identified. That concept is now “flipped” so\n\nthat identification through identifiers becomes the only form of identity in the\n\ntime of database governance. This involves a radical transformation in the\n\nposition of the individual.\n\nThe submission which has been urged on behalf of the petitioners is that an\n\nindividual entitled to the protection of the freedoms and liberties guaranteed by\n\nPart III of the Constitution must have the ability to assert a choice of the\n\nmeans of identification for proving identity. Requiring an individual to prove\n\nidentity on the basis of one mode alone will, it is submitted, violate the right of\n\nself-determination and free choice.\n\n311 Ibid\nPART G\n\n186 The Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations, 2016 stipulate in\n\nRegulation 4\n, the demographic information which is required for enrolment.\n\nRegulation 4\nis in the following terms:\n\n“4. Demographic information required for enrolment.-\n\n(1) The following demographic information shall be collected\nfrom all individuals undergoing enrolment (other than children\nbelow five years of age):\n\n(i) Name;\n(ii) Date of Birth;\n(iii) Gender;\n(iv) Residential Address.\n\n(2) The following demographic information may also\nadditionally be collected during enrolment, at the option of the\nindividual undergoing enrolment:\n\n(i) Mobile number;\n\n(ii) Email address.\n\n(3) In case of Introducer-based enrolment, the following\nadditional information shall be collected:\n\n(i) Introducer name;\n\n(ii) Introducer’s Aadhaar number.\n\n(4) In case of Head of Family based enrolment, the following\nadditional information shall be collected:\n\n(i) Name of Head of Family;\n\n(ii) Relationship;\n\n(iii) Head of Family’s Aadhaar number;\n\n(iv) One modality of biometric information of the Head of\nFamily.\n\n(5) The standards of the above demographic information shall\nbe as may be specified by the Authority for this purpose.\nPART G\n\n(6) The demographic information shall not include race,\nreligion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, record of\nentitlement, income or medical history of the resident.”\n\nRegulation 9\npostulates that at the time of enrolment, the enrolling agency\n\nshall inform the individual who is undergoing enrolment of (i) the manner in\n\nwhich the information shall be used; (ii) the nature of recipients with whom the\n\ninformation is intended to be shared during authentication; and (iii) the\n\nexistence of a right to access information. Under\nRegulation 10\n, a resident\n\nseeking enrolment has to submit an application for enrolment together with\n\ncopies of supporting documents for proof of identity, address and date of birth.\n\nSchedule II indicates a list of supporting documents which are accepted for\n\nverification of identity, address and date of birth. If a resident does not\n\npossess the supporting documents, enrolment is contemplated through an\n\nintroducer or a Head of Family. Schedule II contains as many as eighteen\n\ndocuments which are accepted towards proof of identity and thirty three\n\ndocuments as proof of address. The Aadhaar Act, it has been contended,\n\nallows the resident to identify herself through any of the stipulated documents\n\nfor the purpose of availing an Aadhaar number. The Aadhaar number can be\n\navailed of to secure a subsidy, benefit or service under\nSection 7\n, the\n\nexpenditure of which is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nArticle 266\nof the Constitution provides as follows:\n\n“266. Consolidated Funds and public accounts of India and of\nthe States\nPART G\n\n(1) Subject to the provisions of\nArticle 267\nand to the\nprovisions of this Chapter with respect to the assignment of\nthe whole or part of the net proceeds of certain taxes and\nduties to States, all revenues received by the Government of\nIndia, all loans raised by that Government by the issue of\ntreasury bills, loans or ways and means advances and all\nmoneys received by that Government in repayment of loans\nshall form one consolidated fund to be entitled the\n“Consolidated Fund of India”, and all revenues received by\nthe Government of a State, all loans raised by that\nGovernment by the issue of treasury bills, loans or ways and\nmeans advances and all moneys received by that\nGovernment in repayment of loans shall form one\nconsolidated fund to be entitled “the Consolidated Fund of the\nState”.\n\n(2) All other public moneys received by or on behalf of the\nGovernment of India or the Government of a State shall be\ncredited to the public account of India or the public account of\nthe State, as the case may be\n(3) No moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India or the\nConsolidated Fund of a State shall be appropriated except in\naccordance with law and for the purposes and in the manner\nprovided in this Constitution.”\n\n187 The Union Government is the custodian of the Consolidated Fund under\n\nArticle 266.\nAll revenues received by the government form part of the\n\nConsolidated Fund. No part of its proceeds can be “appropriated except in\n\naccordance with law and for the purpose and in the manner” which is provided\n\nby the Constitution. As the custodian of the fund, the Union Government, it\n\nhas been submitted by the respondents, had the Aadhaar Act enacted through\n\nParliament.\nThe Act\nplaces a restriction on the right of the individual to utilize\n\nany other identification save and except for the Aadhaar number, for the\n\npurpose of availing of a subsidy, benefit or service that involves an\n\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund. The purpose of making an Aadhaar\n\nnumber mandatory for the delivery of benefits, services and subsidies funded\n\nfrom the Consolidated Fund is to confirm the identity of the individual to whom\nPART G\n\nthe benefit is being transferred. This was in order to ensure that the benefits\n\nunder social welfare programmes funded by the Consolidated Fund reach the\n\nhands of targeted beneficiaries. The Union Government which expends huge\n\nsums of money in its welfare schemes was apprised of the fact that money\n\nwhich was meant for the beneficiaries was being siphoned off through ghosts\n\nand duplicates. As a result, genuine beneficiaries would be deprived of their\n\nbasic rights. Cornering of benefits by the creation of bogus identities seriously\n\nimpacted upon social welfare measures adopted by the Union Government as\n\nan instrument of fostering social and economic development. It was to deal\n\nwith this evil that the Aadhaar project assumed a statutory character in 2016.\n\nThrough the provisions of the law, Parliament intended that Aadhaar should\n\nbecome an effective instrument of de-duplication. This is premised on the\n\nview of the legislating body that the use of biometrics would render it difficult, if\n\nnot impossible, to obtain fake identities. Aadhaar, in other words, was\n\nadopted as a matter of legislative policy to curb the evil of shell companies\n\nand ghost identities. Where the State expends large sums on social welfare\n\nprojects, it has a legitimate interest in ensuring that the resources which it\n\ndeploys reach the hands of those for whom they are meant.\n\nThus, there are two important facets of the Aadhaar regime which must be\n\nnoticed. The first is that under\nSection 3\n, it is a voluntary option of the\n\nindividual to choose Aadhaar as a form of identification. However, if the\n\nindividual seeks a subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is\nPART G\n\nincurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, Aadhaar becomes a mandatory\n\nrequirement. The second important feature is the requirement of informed\n\nconsent when the individual parts with identity information. The mandate of\n\nSection 7\nmust be understood from the perspective of the obligation imposed\n\non the State to ensure effective and efficient utilization of public resources.\n\nArticle 266\nreinforces that mandate in its stipulation that all monies out of the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India can only be appropriated in accordance with law,\n\nfor the purpose of and in the manner provided by the Constitution.\nThe State\n\nis a trustee of public resources. The adoption of Aadhaar is in fulfilment of the\n\ndoctrine of public trust. The state is under a bounden obligation to ensure that\n\nits revenues which are placed in the Consolidated Fund are appropriated in\n\naccordance with law and are not diverted for extraneous purposes. These\n\nprinciples have been elucidated in the decisions of this Court in Natural\n\nResources Allocation, In Re, Special Reference No.1 of 2012312, Centre\n\nfor\nPublic Interest Litigation v Union of India313\n,\nReliance Telecom\n\nLimited v Union of India314\n.\n\nThe mandate of\nSection 7\nis founded on a legitimate state interest. The state\n\nhas a vital interest in ensuring that public revenues are duly accounted, that\n\nthe Consolidated Fund is utilized for purposes authorized by law; that funds\n\nfor development reach genuine beneficiaries and that scarce public resources\n\n312 (2012) 10 SCC 1\n313 (2012) 3 SCC 1\n314 (2017) 4 SCC 269\nPART H\n\nmeant for those at the foot of the socio-economic ladder are not mis-utilized\n\nby rent-seeking behavior.\n\nH Proportionality\n\n188 The petitioners have challenged the constitutional validity of the\n\nAadhaar project and the Aadhaar Act on various grounds including the\n\nviolation of the fundamental rights of citizens including the right to privacy and\n\ndignity. The respondents, in defense, have argued that Aadhaar is an enabler\n\nof identity and empowers citizens to realise various facets of the right to life,\n\nsuch as the right to food and livelihood.\n\n189 The learned Attorney General has argued that the use and\n\nauthentication of the Aadhaar number is a necessary and proportionate\n\nmeasure to ensure targeted delivery of financial benefits and services and to\n\nprevent ‘leakages’. He submits that the Aadhaar scheme satisfies the test of\n\nproportionality: it has a rational nexus with the goal that it seeks to achieve,\n\nand since welfare benefits enhance the right to live with dignity, the latter will\n\nprevail over the right to privacy. Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel\n\nhas argued that the “least intrusive test” is not accepted in Indian\n\njurisprudence. He submits that even if the test were to be accepted, the\n\nexercise of determining whether a measure is the least intrusive is a technical\n\nissue for which the Court lacks the requisite expertise. He states that this\nPART H\n\nexercise “cannot be undertaken in the courts with the assistance of lawyers\n\nwho equally have no expertise in the field” and that “such an exercise involves\n\nresearch, study by the experts and courts cannot substitute the same”. Mr\n\nGopal Sankaranarayanan, learned Counsel, submits that the means adopted\n\n“at the moment” are no more than is necessary for ensuring that the “avowed\n\nobjects” are served, and that they balance individual interests (fundamental\n\nrights) with societal interests (directive principles). He further submits that the\n\nfact there are various limitations in place ensure that “some balance” is\n\nachieved between the breach of privacy and the object sought to be achieved.\n\nThis Court must now perform the delicate task of ‘balancing’ these competing\n\ninterests by subjecting the Aadhaar Act to the proportionality test.\n\nH.I Harmonising conflicting rights\n\n190 In the 2003 edition of his celebrated work, Granville Austin recounts the\n\nwords of Prime Minister Morarji Desai that freedom and bread are not\n\nincompatible, but further adds, ‘Neither could they easily be sought\n\ntogether’.315 As mentioned earlier, Granville Austin had insightfully spoken\n\nabout how the strands of the Constitution of unity-integrity, democracy and\n\nsocial revolution could come in conflict with one another creating challenges\n\nfor those who work with the Constitution.316 Some of the questions inherent in\n\n315 Granville Austin, Working a Democratic Constitution: A History of the Indian Experience, Oxford University\nPress (2003), at page 652\n316 Ibid, at page 651\nPART H\n\nthe Constitution according to him are “Democracy for whom? Justice for\n\nwhom? What is Justice? What are the appropriate means of employing the\n\nConstitution’s means’ among citizens, between them and their\n\ngovernment?”317 It was due to the foresight of the framers of the Constitution\n\nthat they insisted that neither the strand of social revolution nor the strand of\n\ndemocracy was to be pursued at the expense of the other.318\n\nThe ostensible conflict between bread and freedom has also been explored in\n\nthe works of Professor Upendra Baxi. In a seminal essay on human rights in\n\n1984 which he calls the “the great gift of classical and contemporary human\n\nthought to culture and civilization”319, he discusses the widening sphere of\n\nhuman rights thought and action to new arenas and constituencies as “New\n\nrights arise from the womb of the old.”320 He draws on the distinction between\n\nbasic human needs and human rights and argues that the constant struggle\n\nbetween these two forces is the essence of the difference between the right to\n\nbe human approach and the human rights approach.321 It is rightly pointed out\n\nthat a discussion on human rights will always constitute an inherent aspect of\n\nthe larger debate of development. He opines that whatever meaning maybe\n\nascribed to the term “development”, it must ensure that people will not be\n\ndeprived of the right to remain human:\n\n317 Ibid\n318 Ibid\n319Upendra Baxi, From Human Rights to the Right to be Human: Some Heresies, India International Centre\n\nQuarterly, Vol. 13, No. 3/4, Pg.185, (December 1986)\n320 Ibid, at page 185\n321 Ibid\nPART H\n\n“Whatever it may be made to mean, “development” must at\nleast mean this: people will be given the right to be and\nremain human. Total and continuing destitution and\nimpoverishment exposes people to a loss of their humanity. In\nno society that takes human rights seriously should there be\nallowed a state of affairs where human beings become sub-\nhuman—that is, when they perforce have to surrender even\nthose sonorously recited \"inalienable\" rights of man… The\nexpression \"human rights\" presupposes a level at which\nbiological entities are bestowed with the dignity of being\ncalled human. The bearers of human rights must have an\nimplicit right to be and remain human, allowing them some\nautonomy of choice in planning survival.”322\n\nThus, the broader matrix of human rights includes within it the inalienable and\n\nfundamental right to always ‘be and remain human’. Professor Upendra Baxi\n\nnotes that this broader debate between human rights and the ‘right to be\n\nhuman’ is reflective of the bread vs freedom conflict. It is noted that\n\nhistorically, freedom might have been chosen over bread due to the vast\n\nenumeration of liberal rights it includes, despite the acute awareness that\n\nwithout bread, freedom of speech and assembly, of association, of\n\nconscience and religion, of political participation, symbolic adult suffrage may\n\nall be meaningless.323 At the same time, Baxi points out the danger in\n\nchoosing bread at the cost of freedom, given that historically in the absence of\n\nfreedom, human beings have been subject to the most egregious indignities:\n\n“The provision of \"bread\" may justify indefinite\npostponement of the provision of any kind of\n\"freedom\". In the absence of such freedom, even the\npromised \"bread\" may not be realized by the masses;\nindeed, they even lose, in the process, their power to\nprotest at the indignity of regime sponsored starvation.\nThis, indeed, is a possibility which has materialized\nmore often than not.”324\n\n322 Ibid, at page 187\n323 Ibid, at page 186\n324 Ibid, at page 190\nPART H\n\nBaxi concludes that the choice between bread and freedom is a false\n\nantithesis. The challenge is not a choice in the abstract between bread and\n\nfreedom but rather the balancing of the two:325\n\n“But the issues are not really \"bread\" and/or \"freedom\" in the\nabstract, but rather who has how much of each, for how long,\nat what cost to others, and why. Some people have both\n\"bread\" and \"freedom\"; others have \"freedom\" but little\n\"bread\" or none at all; yet others have half a loaf (which is\nbetter than none, surely!) with or without freedom; and still\nothers have a precarious mix where \"bread\" is assured if\ncertain (not all) freedoms are bartered.”326\n\nIt is the foremost duty of the State to work towards achieving and maintaining\n\na fine balance, taking into account these myriad considerations. The State\n\nmust always be guided by the knowledge and sense of duty that in a true\n\ndemocracy, the citizens cannot be made to choose between rights and needs,\n\nas they are equally entitled to both. As the sentinel of justice and protector of\n\nfundamental rights, it is the responsibility of this Court to act as a check and\n\nensure that government action or inaction does not endanger or threaten to\n\ndisturb the balance that the Constitution seeks to achieve. It is imperative to\n\nremember that both ‘bread’ and ‘freedom’ play a vital role in the guaranteeing\n\nto our citizens the gamut of human rights and freedoms that make human\n\nexistence meaningful.\n\n191 While exercising judicial review, courts are often confronted with\n\nsituations involving conflicts between rights, tensions between individuals\n\narising from the assertion of rights and discord arising out of the assertion of\n325 Ibid, at page 186\n326 Ibid, at page 186\nPART H\n\nthe same right by two or more individuals. Conflicts between rights arise when\n\nthe assertion of a fundamental human right by an individual impacts upon the\n\nexercise of distinct freedoms by others. The freedom of one individual to\n\nspeak and to express may affect the dignity of another. A person may be\n\naggrieved when the free exercise of the right to speak by someone impinges\n\nupon his or her reputation, which is integral to the right to life under\nArticle 21.\n\nA conflict will, in such a situation, arise between a right which is asserted\n\nunder\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nby one citizen and the sense of injury of another who\n\nclaims protection of the right to dignity under\nArticle 21.\nConflicts also arise\n\nwhen the exercise of rights is perceived to impact upon the collective identity\n\nof another group of persons. Conflicts may arise when an activity or conduct\n\nof an individual, in pursuit of a freedom recognised by the Constitution,\n\nimpinges upon the protection afforded to another individual under the rubric of\n\nthe same human right. Such a situation involves a conflict arising from a\n\nfreedom which is relatable to the same constitutional guarantee. Privacy is an\n\nassertion of the right to life under\nArticle 21.\nThe right to a dignified existence\n\nis also protected by the same Article. A conflict within\nArticle 21\nmay involve a\n\nsituation when two freedoms are asserted as political rights. A conflict may\n\nalso envisage a situation where an assertion of a political right under the\n\numbrella of the right to life stands in conflict with the assertion of an economic\n\nright which is also comprehended by the protection of life under the\n\nConstitution.\nPART H\n\nSuch conflicts require the court to embark on a process of judicial\n\ninterpretation. The task is to achieve a sense of balance. An ideal situation\n\nwould be one which would preserve the core of the right for both sets of\n\ncitizens whose entitlements to freedom appear to be in conflict. Realistically,\n\ndrawing balances is not a simple task. Balances involve sacrifices and the\n\nforegoing of entitlements. In making those decisions, a certain degree of\n\nvalue judgment is inevitable. The balance which the court draws may be open\n\nto criticism in regard to its value judgment on the relative importance ascribed\n\nto the conflicting rights in judicial decision making. In making those fine\n\nbalances, the court can pursue an objective formulation by relying upon those\n\nvalues which the Constitution puts forth as part of its endeavour for a just\n\nsociety. Our Constitution has in Part III recognised the importance of political\n\nfreedom. In Part IV, the Constitution has recognised our social histories of\n\ndiscrimination and prejudice which have led to poverty, deprivation and the\n\nabsence of a dignified existence to major segments of society. Holding Part III\n\nin balance with Part IV is integral to the vision of social and economic justice\n\nwhich the Constitution has sought to achieve consistent with political\n\ndemocracy. Difficult as this area is, a balancing of rights is inevitable, when\n\nrights asserted by individuals are in conflict.\n\n192 Several decisions of this Court over the last two decades have sought\n\nto bring order to the clash between fundamental rights.\nIn People’s Union for\nPART H\n\nCivil Liberties (PUCL) v Union of India327\n, this Court was called upon to\n\nbalance the right to information of voters (requiring the disclosure of the\n\nassets of candidates and their spouses at an election) with the right to privacy\n\nimplicit in\nArticle 21.\nIn drawing the balance, a bench of three Judges of this\n\nCourt gave primacy to the entitlement of citizens to be informed about the\n\naffairs of those who would represent them in electoral democracy. As the\n\nCourt held:\n\n“121…By calling upon the contesting candidate to disclose\nthe assets and liabilities of his/her spouse, the fundamental\nright to information of a voter/citizen is thereby promoted.\nWhen there is a competition between the right to privacy of an\nindividual and the right to information of the citizens, the\nformer right has to be subordinated to the latter right as it\nserves the larger public interest. The right to know about the\ncandidate who intends to become a public figure and a\nrepresentative of the people would not be effective and real if\nonly truncated information of the assets and liabilities is\ngiven.”328\n\nThe Court held that the provision contained in the\nRepresentation of People\n\nAct\n1951 for a disclosure of assets and liabilities only to the Speaker or to the\n\nChairman of the House did not adequately protect the citizen’s right to\n\ninformation, resulting in a violation of the guarantee of free speech and\n\nexpression.\n\n193 In\nThalappalam Service Cooperative Bank Limited v State of\n\nKerala329\n, this Court dealt with a conflict between the right to information\n\n327 (2003) 4 SCC 399\n328 Ibid, at page 472\n329 (2013) 16 SCC 82\nPART H\n\n[(protected by\nArticle 19(1)(a)]\nand the right to privacy (protected by Article\n\n21). The Court observed:\n\n“61. The right to information and right to privacy are,\ntherefore, not absolute rights, both the rights, one of which\nfalls under\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand the other under\nArticle 21\nof\nthe Constitution of India, can obviously be regulated,\nrestricted and curtailed in the larger public interest. Absolute\nor uncontrolled individual rights do not and cannot exist in any\nmodern State. Citizens' right to get information is statutorily\nrecognised by the\nRTI Act\n, but at the same time limitations\nare also provided in the Act itself, which is discernible from\nthe Preamble and other provisions of the Act.”330\n\nThe Court held that the balance between the right to information and the right\n\nto privacy is drawn under the\nRight to Information Act\n2005: if the information\n\nwhich is sought is personal and has no relationship with a public activity or\n\ninterest, a public authority is not legally bound to provide such information. If\n\nthe information which is sought is to be made available in the larger public\n\ninterest, reasons have to be recorded because the person from whom the\n\ninformation is sought has a right to privacy guaranteed by\nArticle 21.\n\nThalappalam considered a conflict arising between two fundamental rights,\n\nthe right to information protected by\nArticle 19(1)(a)\nand the right to privacy\n\nwhich is protected by\nArticle 21.\n\n194 More recently, in\nG Sundarrajan v Union of India331\n, a two judge\n\nBench considered a challenge to the establishment of a nuclear power plant\n\non the ground that it would violate the right to life guaranteed by\nArticle 21.\n\nNoting that there was a need to draw a balance between the assertion of\n\n330 Ibid, at page 112\n331 (2013) 6 SCC 620\nPART H\n\nseveral rights including the protection of the environment, the Court observed\n\nthat the larger public interest must prevail:\n\n“198. We have to resolve the issue whether the establishment\nof NPP would have the effect of violating the right to life\nguaranteed under\nArticle 21\nto the persons who are residing\nin and around Kudankulam or by establishing the NPP, it will\nuphold the right to life in a larger sense. While balancing the\nbenefit of establishing KKNPP Units 1 to 6, with right to life and\nproperty and the protection of environment including marine\nlife, we have to strike a balance, since the production of\nnuclear energy is of extreme importance for the economic\ngrowth of our country, alleviate poverty, generate\nemployment, etc. While setting up a project of this nature, we\nhave to have an overall view of larger public interest rather\nthan smaller violation of right to life guaranteed under\nArticle\nof the Constitution.”332\n\nIn\nSubramanian Swamy v Union of India333\n, the learned Chief Justice,\n\nspeaking for a Bench of two judges emphasised the need for a sense of\n\nbalance when the assertion of fundamental rights by two citizens is in conflict:\n\n“137…One fundamental right of a person may have to coexist\nin harmony with the exercise of another fundamental right by\nothers and also with reasonable and valid exercise of power\nby the State in the light of the directive principles in the\ninterests of social welfare as a whole. The Court's duty is to\nstrike a balance between competing claims of different\ninterests.”334\n\nNoting that the “balancing of fundamental rights is a constitutional necessity”,\n\nthe Court has attempted to harmonise reputation as an intrinsic element of the\n\nright to life under\nArticle 21\nwith criminal defamation as a restriction under\n\nArticle 19(2).\n\n332 Ibid, at page 714\n333 (2016) 7 SCC 221\n334 Ibid, at page 319\nPART H\n\n195 In Asha Ranjan v Chandrakeshwar Prasad335, this Court dealt with a\n\ncase involving a conflict between the fundamental rights of two individuals\n\nwithin\nArticle 21.\nThere was on the one hand an assertion of the right to life on\n\nthe part of an individual accused of an offence, who claimed a right to a fair\n\ntrial, and the protection of the interests of the victim which was also relatable\n\nto the same fundamental right under\nArticle 21.\nIn resolving the conflict, the\n\nCourt gave expression to the need to preserve “paramount collective\n\ninterests”:\n\n“61…circumstances may emerge that may necessitate for\nbalancing between intra-fundamental rights. It has been\ndistinctly understood that the test that has to be applied while\nbalancing the two fundamental rights or inter fundamental\nrights, … may be different than the principle to be applied in\nintra-conflict between the same fundamental right. To\nelaborate, as in this case, the accused has a fundamental\nright to have a fair trial under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution.\nSimilarly, the victims who are directly affected and also form a\npart of the constituent of the collective, have a fundamental\nright for a fair trial. Thus, there can be two individuals both\nhaving legitimacy to claim or assert the right. The factum of\nlegitimacy is a primary consideration. It has to be\nremembered that no fundamental right is absolute and it can\nhave limitations in certain circumstances. Thus, permissible\nlimitations are imposed by the State. The said limitations are\nto be within the bounds of law. However, when there is intra-\nconflict of the right conferred under the same article, like fair\ntrial in this case, the test that is required to be applied, we are\ndisposed to think, it would be “paramount collective interest”\nor “sustenance of public confidence in the justice\ndispensation system”.336\n\n196 These decisions indicate that the process of resolving conflicts arising\n\nout of the assertion of different fundamental rights and conflicts within the\n\nsame fundamental right, necessarily involves judicial balancing. In finding a\n\n335 (2017) 4 SCC 397\n336 Ibid, at page 433\nPART H\n\njust balance this Court has applied norms such as the ‘paramount public\n\ninterest’. In seeking to draw the balance between political freedoms and\n\neconomic freedoms, the Court must preserve the euphony between\n\nfundamental rights and directive principles. It is on their co-existence that the\n\nedifice of the Constitution is founded. Neither can exist without the other.\n\nDemocracy rejects the totalitarian option of recognising economic entitlements\n\nwithout political liberty. Economic rights have become justiciable because of\n\nthe constitutional guarantees founded on freedom and the rule of law. The\n\nConstitution is founded on democratic governance and is based on the\n\nprotection of individual freedom. Freedom comprehends both fundamental\n\npolitical freedoms as well as basic human rights. A just balance between the\n\ntwo is integral to the fulfilment of India’s constitutional commitment to realise\n\nhuman liberty in a social context which is cognizant of the histories of\n\ndiscrimination and prejudice suffered by large segments of our society. Where\n\nthe question is related to the limiting the right to privacy, Puttaswamy requires\n\nthe test of proportionality. It has, therefore, to be tested whether the Aadhaar\n\nscheme fulfils the test of proportionality.\n\n197 The test of proportionality, which began as an unwritten set of general\n\nprinciples of law, today constitutes the dominant “best practice” judicial\n\nstandard for resolving disputes that involve either a conflict between two rights\n\nclaims or between a right and a legitimate government interest. 337 It has\n\n337JudMathews and Alec Stone Sweet, All things in Proportion? American Rights Review and the Problem of\nBalancing, Emory Law Journal, Vol. 60 (2011)\nPART H\n\nbecome a “centrepiece of jurisprudence” across the European continent as\n\nwell as in common law jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, South\n\nAfrica and Israel.338 Proportionality is the “defining doctrinal core of a\n\ntransnational rights-based constitutionalism”339. It has been raised to the rank\n\nof a fundamental constitutional principle,340 and represents a global shift from\n\na culture of authority to a culture of justification.341 Servin argues that\n\njurisprudence on privacy has evolved from the “right to be let alone”, to now\n\nbeing centered around the principle of proportionality.342\n\n198 Subjecting the Aadhaar scheme to the test of proportionality does not\n\nmean that the Court is second-guessing the wisdom of the legislature. State\n\naction must be subjected to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it passes\n\nconstitutional muster. The test of proportionality stipulates that the nature and\n\nextent of the State’s interference with the exercise of a right (in this case, the\n\nrights to privacy, dignity, choice, and access to basic entitlements) must be\n\nproportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve (in this case, purported plugging\n\nof welfare leakage and better targeting).\n\n338Alec Stone Sweet & Jud Mathews, Proportionality Balancing and Global Constitutionalism, Columbia\nJournal of Transnational Law, Vol. 47 (2008)\n339Jud Mathews and Alec Stone Sweet, All things in Proportion?

Introducing the Interim Bill of\nRights, South African Journal on Human Rights, Vol. 10 (1994)\n342Andrew B. Serwin, Privacy 3.0 – The Principle of Proportionality, University of Michigan Journal of Law\n\nReform, Vol. 42 (2009)\nPART H\n\nWithin the framework of constitutional interpretation, proportionality serves as\n\na test to determine the extent to which fundamental rights can be limited in the\n\nface of legislative intervention which purports to further social and public\n\ninterest aims. Aharon Barak, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\n\nIsrael has described the importance of the proportionality test as thus:343\n\n“Examination of the test of proportionality (in the narrow\nsense) returns us to first principles that are the foundation of\nour constitutional democracy and the human rights … Our\ndemocracy is characterized by the fact that it imposes limits\non the ability to violate human rights; that it is based on the\nrecognition that surrounding the individual there is a wall\nprotecting his right, which cannot be breached even by\nmajority.”\n\nIn applying the proportionality test, the Court cannot mechanically defer to the\n\nState’s assertions. Especially given the intrusive nature of the Aadhaar\n\nscheme, such deference to the legislature is inappropriate. The State must\n\ndischarge its burden by demonstrating that rights-infringing measures were\n\nnecessary and proportionate to the goal sought to be achieved.\n\nH.2 Proportionality standard in Indian jurisprudence\n\n199 In India, the principle of proportionality has a long jurisprudential history\n\nwhich has been adverted to in a judgment344 of this Court:\n\n“On account of a Chapter on Fundamental Rights in Part III of\nour Constitution right from 1950, Indian Courts did not suffer\nfrom the disability similar to the one experienced by English\nCourts for declaring as unconstitutional legislation on the\nprinciple of proportionality or reading them in a manner\n\n343 Adalah v. The Minister of Interior, HCJ 7052/03, English translation available at\nhttp://elyon.court.gov.il/files_eng/03/520/070a47/03070520.a47.pdf\nOm Kumar v Union of India\n, (2001) 2 SCC 386\nPART H\n\nconsistent with the charter of rights. Ever since 1950, the\nprinciple of ‘proportionality’ has indeed been applied\nvigorously to legislative (and administrative action) in\nIndia. While dealing with the validity of legislation infringing\nfundamental freedoms enumerated in\nArticle 19(1)\nof the\nConstitution of India…this court had occasion to consider\nwhether the restrictions imposed by legislation were\ndisproportionate to the situation and were not the least\nrestrictive of the choices.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe early decisions of this Court may not have used the expression\n\n“proportionality”. But the manner in which the court explained what would be a\n\npermissible restraint on rights indicates the seeds or the core of the\n\nproportionality standard. Proportionality has been the core of reasonableness\n\nsince the 1950s.\n\nChintaman Rao v State of Madhya Pradesh345\nconcerned\n\na State legislation which empowered the government to prohibit people in\n\ncertain areas from manufacturing bidis. The object of the law was to ensure\n\nthe supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in areas where bidi\n\nmanufacturing was an alternative source of employment for persons likely to\n\nbe engaged in agricultural labour. The Court held that the State need not have\n\nprohibited all labourers from engaging in bidi manufacturing throughout the\n\nyear in order to satisfy the objective. Justice Mahajan, on behalf of a\n\nConstitution Bench held:\n\n“6.The phrase \"reasonable restriction\" connotes that the\nlimitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right\nshould not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond\nwhat is required in the interests of the public. The word\n\"reasonable\" implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is,\nthe choice of a course which reason dictates. Legislation\nwhich arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot\nbe said to contain the quality of reasonableness and\nunless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom\n\n345 1950 SCR 759\nPART H\n\nguaranteed in\narticle 19(1)(g)\nand the social control permitted\nby clause (6) of\narticle 19\n, it must be held to be wanting in\nthat quality.” (Emphasis supplied)\nState of Madras v V G Row346\nconsidered whether the action of the\n\nTamil Nadu government in declaring an association unlawful violated\nArticle\n\n19(1)(c)\nof the Constitution. Chief Justice Patanjali Sastri, speaking for the\n\nConstitution Bench, propounded what has come to be regarded as a classic\n\nstatement of the principle of proportionality in our law:\n\n“15…the test of reasonableness, wherever prescribed, should\nbe applied to each individual statute impugned, and no\nabstract standard, or general pattern of reasonableness can\nbe laid down as applicable to all cases. The nature of the right\nalleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the\nrestrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil\nsought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the\nimposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all\nenter into the judicial verdict...” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe decision of the Constitution Bench in\nState of Bihar v Kamla Kant\n\nMisra347\nconcerned a challenge to the second part of sub-section (6) of\n\nSection 144\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure on the ground that it violated\n\nsub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) of Clause (1) of\nArticle 19\nof the Constitution.\n\nJustice K S Hegde, speaking for the majority, observed:\n\n“15.One of the important tests to find out whether a restriction\nis reasonable is to see …whether the restriction is in\nexcess of the requirement or whether it is imposed in an\narbitrary manner”.348 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n346 1952 SCR 597\n347 (1969) 3 SCC 337\n348 Ibid, at page 345\nPART H\n\n201 In\nMohammed Faruk v State of Madhya Pradesh349\na Constitution\n\nBench of this Court held that in determining the proportionality of a measure\n\nrestricting an individual’s right under\nArticle 19(1)(g)\nof the Constitution, the\n\nfactors to be taken into consideration would include whether a less drastic\n\nrestriction would have served the purpose. As the Court held:\n\n“10…The Court must in considering the validity of the\nimpugned law imposing a prohibition on the carrying on\nof a business or profession, attempt an evaluation of its\ndirect and immediate impact upon the fundamental rights\nof the citizens affected thereby and the larger public\ninterest sought to be ensured in the light of the object\nsought to be achieved, the necessity to restrict the\ncitizen's freedom, [...],the possibility of achieving the\nobject by imposing a less drastic restraint , [...] or\nthat a less drastic restriction may ensure the object\nintended to be achieved.”350\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn\nBishambhar Dayal Chandra Mohan v State of Uttar Pradesh351\n,\n\n“reasonable restriction” was held to mean that the limitation imposed on the\n\nenjoyment of a right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond\n\nwhat is required in the interests of the public.\n\n202 The decision in\nOm Kumar v Union of India352\nconcerned the quantum\n\nof punishment imposed in departmental disciplinary proceedings. Justice M.\n\nJagannadha Rao, speaking for a two judge Bench, defined proportionality in\n\nthe following terms:\n\n“28. By 'proportionality', we mean the question whether, while\nregulating exercise of fundamental rights, the appropriate or\n\n349 (1969) 1 SCC 853\n350 Ibid, at page 857\n351 (1982) 1 SCC 39\n352 (2001) 2 SCC 386\nPART H\n\nleast restrictive choice of measures has been made by the\nlegislature or the administrator so as to achieve the object of\nthe legislation or the purpose of the administrative order, as\nthe case may be. Under the principle, the Court will see that\nthe legislature and the administrative authority 'maintain a\nproper balance between the adverse effects which the\nlegislation or the administrative order may have on the rights,\nliberties or interests of persons keeping in mind the purpose\nwhich they were intended to serve'. The legislature and the\nadministrative authority are however given an area of\ndiscretion or a range of choices but as to whether the\nchoice made infringes the rights excessively or not is for\nthe Court. That is what is meant by proportionality.”353\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn\nTeri Oat Estates v U.T., Chandigarh354\n, this Court adopted a similar\n\ninterpretation of proportionality.\n\n203 In\nModern Dental College and Research Centre v State of Madhya\n\nPradesh,355\na Constitution Bench of this Court while dealing with a challenge\n\nto the vires of the Madhya Pradesh Niji Vyavasayik Shikshan Sanstha\n\n(Pravesh Ka Viniyaman Avam Shulk Ka Nirdharan) Adhiniyam, 2007, held\n\nthat proportionality is the correct test to apply in the context of\nArticle 19(6).\n\nJustice A K Sikri, speaking for the Court, held thus :\n\n“60…Thus, while examining as to whether the impugned\nprovisions of the statute and Rules amount to reasonable\nrestrictions and are brought out in the interest of the general\npublic, the exercise that is required to be undertaken is the\nbalancing of fundamental right to carry on occupation on the\none hand and the restrictions imposed on the other hand.\nThis is what is known as 'Doctrine of Proportionality'.\nJurisprudentially, 'proportionality' can be defined as the\nset of Rules determining the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for limitation of a constitutionally protected\n\n353 Ibid, at page 399\n354 (2004) 2 SCC 130\n355 (2016) 7 SCC 353\nPART H\n\nright by a law to be constitutionally permissible...”356\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nWhile expounding on the theory of proportionality, Justice AK Sikri referred to\n\nAharon Barak’s seminal book357 on proportionality:\n\n“60…A limitation of a constitutional right will be\nconstitutionally permissible if: (i) it is designated for a proper\npurpose; (ii) the measures undertaken to effectuate such a\nlimitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of that\npurpose; (iii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that\nthere are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve\nthat same purpose with a lesser degree of limitation; and\nfinally (iv) there needs to be a proper relation ('proportionality\nstricto sensu' or 'balancing') between the importance of\nachieving the proper purpose and the social importance of\npreventing the limitation on the constitutional right.”358\n\nJustice Sikri held that laws limiting constitutional rights must satisfy the test of\n\nproportionality:\n\n“63…The law imposing restrictions will be treated as\nproportional if it is meant to achieve a proper purpose, and if\nthe measures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally\nconnected to the purpose, and such measures are\nnecessary….359\n\n64. The exercise which, therefore, to be taken is to find out as\nto whether the limitation of constitutional rights is for a\npurpose that is reasonable and necessary in a\ndemocratic society and such an exercise involves the\nweighing up of competitive values, and ultimately an\nassessment based on proportionality i.e. balancing of\ndifferent interests.”360 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n356 Ibid, at page 412\n357 Aharon Barak, Proportionality: Constitutional Rights and their Limitations, Cambridge University Press (2012)\n358 Ibid, at page 412\n359 Ibid, at page 414\n360 Ibid, at page 415\nPART H\n\n204 In KS Puttaswamy v Union of India361, one of us (Chandrachud J.),\n\nspeaking for four judges, laid down the tests that would need to be satisfied\n\nunder our Constitution for violations of privacy to be justified. This included the\n\ntest of proportionality:\n\n“325…A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to\nwithstand the touchstone of permissible restrictions on\nfundamental rights. In the context of\nArticle 21\nan invasion of\nprivacy must be justified on the basis of a law which stipulates\na procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law must\nalso be valid with reference to the encroachment on life and\npersonal liberty under\nArticle 21.\nAn invasion of life or\npersonal liberty must meet the three-fold requirement of (i)\nlegality, which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need,\ndefined in terms of a legitimate state aim; and (iii)\nproportionality which ensures a rational nexus between the\nobjects and the means adopted to achieve them.”362\n\nThe third principle (iii above) adopts the test of proportionality to ensure a\n\nrational nexus between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them.\n\nThe essential role of the test of proportionality is to enable the court to\n\ndetermine whether a legislative measure is disproportionate in its interference\n\nwith the fundamental right. In determining this, the court will have regard to\n\nwhether a less intrusive measure could have been adopted consistent with the\n\nobject of the law and whether the impact of the encroachment on a\n\nfundamental right is disproportionate to the benefit which is likely to ensue.\n\nThe proportionality standard must be met by the procedural and substantive\n\naspects of the law.\n\n361 (2017) 10 SCC 1\n362 Ibid, at page 509\nPART H\n\nJustice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, in his concurring opinion, suggested a four-\n\npronged test as follows363:\n\n“(i)The action must be sanctioned by law;\n\n(ii) The proposed action must be necessary in a democratic\nsociety for a legitimate aim;\n\n(iii) The extent of such interference must be proportionate to\nthe need for such interference;\n\n(iv) There must be procedural guarantees against abuse of\nsuch interference.”\n\nThe ‘test of proportionality’ is a judicially-entrenched principle which has\n\ninvigorated fundamental rights jurisprudence in the country. The application of\n\nthe proportionality standard in rights-based adjudication is well-recognised\n\nacross diverse jurisdictions.\n\nH.3 Comparative jurisprudence\n\n205 Since some of the concerns raised by the Aadhaar scheme have arisen\n\nfor the first time in India, it would be appropriate to discuss judgments of\n\nforeign jurisdictions which have inquired into the proportionality of measures\n\nmany of them similar to those prescribed under the Aadhaar Act.\n\n206 The Privy Council formulated the parameters of proportionality in Elloy\n\nde Freitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries,\n\nLands and Housing,364 elaborating a three-fold test:\n\n“whether: (i) the legislative objective is sufficiently important to\njustify limiting a fundamental right; (ii) the measures designed\n\n363 Ibid, at para 638\n364 [1999] 1 AC 69\nPART H\n\nto meet the legislative objective are rationally connected to it;\n\nand (iii) the means used to impair the right or freedom are no\nmore than is necessary to accomplish the objective.”\n\nSubsequently in Huang (FC) v Secretary of State for the Home\n\nDepartment,365 the House of Lords added a fourth parameter which is “the\n\nneed to balance the interests of society with those of individuals and groups.”\n\n207 In the Federal Census Act Case (Volkszählungsurteil),366 the\n\nFederal Constitutional Court of the Federal Republic of Germany dealt with a\n\nchallenge to the German Federal Census Act, 1983, which provided for\n\ncollection of citizens’ basic personal information, including, inter alia, source of\n\nincome, occupation, supplementary employment, educational background and\n\nhours of work. Certain provisions provided for transmission of statistical data\n\nto local governments for the purposes of regional planning, surveying,\n\nenvironmental protection, and redrawing of election districts. The Court struck\n\ndown provisions permitting transfer of statistical data to local authorities on\n\nthe ground that they enabled authorities to compare census data with local\n\nhousing registries. The Court observed that the combination of statistical data\n\nand a personalized registry could lead to the identification of particular\n\npersons, which would lead to a chilling effect upon individuals’ right to\n\ninformational self-determination.\n\n365 [2007] UKHL 11\n366 (1983) 65 BVerfGE 1\nPART H\n\nThe Court developed a ‘fundamental right of informational self-determination’\n\ndrawing from\nArticles 1(1)\nand\n2(1)\nof the German Constitution, which protect\n\nthe fundamental right to human dignity and the right to freely develop one’s\n\npersonality. Explaining the importance of this right in the context of risks\n\noccasioned by modern data processing, the Court noted that:\n\n“The freedom of individuals to make plans or decisions in\nreliance on their personal powers of self-determination may\nbe significantly inhibited if they cannot with sufficient certainty\ndetermine what information on them is known in certain areas\nof their social sphere and in some measure appraise the\nextent of knowledge in the possession of possible\ninterlocutors. A social order in which individuals can no longer\nascertain who knows what about them and when and a legal\norder that makes this possible would not be compatible with\nthe right to informational self-determination…This would not\nonly restrict the possibilities for personal development of\nthose individuals but also be detrimental to the public good\nsince self-determination is an elementary prerequisite for the\nfunctioning of a free democratic society predicated on the\nfreedom of action and participation of its members…The\nfundamental right guarantees in principle the power of\nindividuals to make their own decisions as regards the\ndisclosure and use of their personal data.”367\n\nThe Court, while recognizing the right to informational self-determination,\n\nobserved that distinct silos of data “can be pieced together with other data\n\ncollections particularly when individual integrated information systems are\n\nbuilt up – to add up to a partial or virtually complete personality profile,” and\n\nthat too with, “the person concerned having no means of controlling its truth\n\nand application.”368 Of crucial importance is the Court’s observation that the\n\nright to informational self-determination is particularly endangered because\n\n367Jürgen Bröhmer et al., “BVerfGE 65, 1 -\nCensus Act\n” in 60 Years German Basic Law: The German\nConstitution and its Court - Landmark Decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in the Area of\nFundamental Rights (Suhainah Wahiduddin ed.), (2012) at Pages 147-148, available at\nhttp://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_32858-1522-1-30.pdf?121123115540\nCensus Act\nCase, (1983)\nPART H\n\nin reaching decisions, one no longer has to rely on manually collected\n\nregistries and files. Today, the technical means of storing individual\n\nstatements about personal or factual situations of a certain or verifiable\n\nperson with the aid of automatic data processing are practically unlimited and\n\ncan be retrieved in a matter of seconds irrespective of distances.369\n\nThe Court noted, however, that the right to informational self-determination is\n\nnot absolute and that public sector entities could collect personal data under\n\ncertain conditions. The Court held that there must be a statutory basis for this\n\ninformational activity, and that it must satisfy the principle of proportionality.\n\nOn the need for a statutory basis, the Court held that:\n\n“The use of the data is limited to the purpose specified by law.\nIf for no other reason than because of the dangers associated\nwith automated data processing, protection is required\nagainst unauthorized use - including protection against such\nuse by other governmental entities - through a prohibition on\nthe transfer and use of such data”370\n“Clearly defined conditions must be created for processing to\nensure that individuals do not become mere data subjects in\nthe context of the automated collection and processing of the\ninformation pertaining to their person. Both the absence of a\nconnection with a specific purpose that can be recognized\nand verified at all times and the multifunctional use of data,\nreinforce the tendencies that are to be checked and restricted\nby data-protection legislation, which represents the concrete\nmanifestation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to\ninformational self-determination.”371\n\nOn the principle of proportionality, the Court held that:\n\n“The legislature must in its statutory regulations respect the\nprinciple of proportionality. This principle, which enjoys\nconstitutional status, follows from the nature of the\nCensus Act\nCase, (1983)\n370 Ibid, at page 150.\n\n371 Ibid, at page 151\nPART H\n\nfundamental rights themselves, which, as an expression of\nthe general right of the public to freedom from interference by\nthe state, may be restricted by the public powers in any given\ncase only insofar as indispensable for the protection of public\ninterests … In view of the threats described above that arise\nfrom the use of automated data processing, the legislature\nmust more than was the case previously, adopt organizational\nand procedural precautions that work counter to the threat of\nviolation of the right of personality …”372\n“The survey program of the 1983\nCensus Act\nalso satisfies, to\nthe extent relevant to the matter under review, the principle of\nproportionality. A measure to achieve the intended purpose\nmust therefore be suitable and necessary; the intensity of the\nattendant action may not be disproportionate to the\nimportance of the matter and the compromises imposed upon\nthe public.”373\n\nThe Court concluded that according to the principles of purpose specification\n\nand proportionality, not only must the purpose for which data is being\n\ncollected be specified at the time of collection, but the data acquired must also\n\nnot exceed that which is absolutely necessary for accomplishing the specified\n\npurpose. In light of this, the Court directed the German Parliament to amend\n\nthe law in certain particulars before the census could be carried out, and to\n\nclose all loopholes in the law that may lead to abuses in the collection,\n\nstorage, use and transfer of personal data.\n\n208 The ECtHR dealt with whether retention of DNA samples of individuals\n\nwho were arrested but who were later acquitted or had charges against them\n\ndropped was a violation of the right to privacy. In S and Marper v United\n\n372 Ibid, at page 149\n373 Ibid, at page 154\nPART H\n\nKingdom,374 the ECtHR noted the “blanket and indiscriminate nature of the\n\npower of retention”:\n\n“The material may be retained irrespective of the nature or\ngravity of the offence with which the individual was originally\nsuspected or of the age of the suspected offender;\nfingerprints and samples may be taken—and retained—from\na person of any age, arrested in connection with a recordable\noffence, which includes minor or non-imprisonable offences.\nThe retention is not time-limited; the material is retained\nindefinitely whatever the nature or seriousness of the offence\nof which the person was suspected. Moreover, there exist\nonly limited possibilities for an acquitted individual to have the\ndata removed from the nationwide database or the materials\ndestroyed; in particular, there is no provision for independent\nreview of the justification for the retention according to\ndefined criteria, including such factors as the seriousness of\nthe offence, previous arrests, the strength of the suspicion\nagainst the person and any other special circumstances.”375\n\nThe Court concluded that the retention constituted a disproportionate\n\ninterference with the Applicants’ right to privacy:\n\n“125…That the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the\npowers of retention of the fingerprints, cellular samples and\nDNA profiles of persons suspected but not convicted of\noffences, as applied in the case of the present applicants,\nfails to strike a fair balance between the competing public and\nprivate interests and that the respondent State has\noverstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this\nregard. Accordingly, the retention at issue constitutes a\ndisproportionate interference with the applicants’ right to\nrespect for private life and cannot be regarded as\nnecessary in a democratic society…”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Court rejected the government’s arguments that fingerprints constituted\n\nneutral, objective, irrefutable and unintelligible material, holding that they\n\ncontained unique information about an individual, allowing their precise\n\n374 (2008) 48 EHRR 1169\n375 Ibid, at Paragraph 119\nPART H\n\nidentification in certain circumstances. The Court concluded that the collection\n\nof fingerprints was therefore capable of affecting private life, and retention of\n\nsuch information without consent “cannot be regarded as neutral or\n\ninsignificant.”\n\n209 In 2012, the French Constitutional Council (“Council”) – the body that\n\nreviews the constitutionality of French laws – declared four provisions of the\n\nIdentity Protection Act, which proposed the introduction of a new national\n\nbiometric ID for citizens, to be unconstitutional.376\nArticles 3\nand\nwere\n\namong the provisions that were struck down.\nArticle 3\nauthorized that the\n\nnational ID card may contain data which would enable the holder to identify\n\nhimself or herself on electronic communication networks or use his or her\n\nelectronic signature. The Article stated that:\n\n“If requested by its holder, the national identity card may also\ncontain data, stored separately, enabling it to identify itself on\nelectronic communication networks and to affix its electronic\nsignature. Upon each use, the interested party shall decide\nwhich identification data are to be transmitted electronically.”\n\nThe Council observed that\nArticle 3\ndid not stipulate the nature of the data that\n\nwas being collected, nor did it provide any guarantee of maintaining\n\nconfidentiality. Thus, the Council declared\nArticle 3\nto be unconstitutional:\n\n“that the provisions of\nArticle 3\ndo not specify either the\nnature of the “data” through which these functions may be\nimplemented or the guarantees ensuring the integrity and\nconfidentiality of this data; that they do not define in any\n\n376Decision No. 2012-652 DC of 22 March 2012 by Le Conseil Constitutionnel, available at http://www.conseil-\nconstitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/english/case-law/sample-of-decisions-in-relevant-areas-\ndc/decision/decision-no-2012-652-dc-of-22-march-2012.105428.html\nPART H\n\ngreater detail the conditions under which the persons\nimplementing these functions are to be authenticated,\nespecially when they are minors or are subject to legal\nprotection; that accordingly, Parliament acted in excess of its\npowers; that accordingly\nArticle 3\nmust be ruled\nunconstitutional;”\n\nArticle 5\nallowed for the establishment of a database of personal information\n\nwhich would include, in addition to the marital status and residence of the\n\nholder, their height, eye colour, fingerprints and photograph for the issuance\n\nof French passports and national ID cards and for conducting investigations\n\ninvolving certain offences if authorised by a public prosecutor or a judge.\n\nThe Council relied on\nArticle 34\nof the French Constitution to hold that it was\n\nincumbent upon the Parliament to strike a balance between safeguarding\n\npublic order and bringing offenders to justice on one hand, and the right to\n\nprivacy on the other. The Council placed reliance on the Declaration of the\n\nRights of Man and the Citizen of 1789.\nArticle 2\nof the Declaration states “The\n\naim of every political association is the preservation of the natural and\n\nimprescriptible rights of Man. These rights are liberty, property, safety and\n\nresistance to oppression”. The Council held that the liberty proclaimed by\n\nArticle 2\nincludes the right to respect for private life, and accordingly, that “the\n\ncollection, registration, conservation, consultation and communication of\n\npersonal data must be justified on grounds of general interest and\n\nimplemented in an adequate manner, proportionate to this objective.” The\n\nCouncil held that\nArticle 5\nviolated the French Constitution as the nature of the\n\ndata collected was such that it would facilitate the identification of French\nPART H\n\ncitizens on the basis of their fingerprints, thus breaching the right to respect\n\nfor private life:\n\n“Considering however that, given its object, this database\ncontaining personal data is intended to collect data relating to\nalmost all of the population of French nationality; that since\nthe biometric data registered in this file, including in\nparticular fingerprints, are themselves liable to be\ncompared with physical traces left involuntarily by an\nindividual or collected unbeknown to him, they are\nparticularly sensitive; that the technical characteristics of\nthis database as defined by the contested provisions\nenable it to be consulted for purposes other than the\nverification of an individual's identity; that the provisions of\nthe act referred authorise this database to be consulted or\nviewed not only in relation to the issue or renewal of identity\nand travel documents or to verify the holder of such a\ndocument, but also for other purposes of an administrative\nnature or by the investigating police;…\n…having regard to the nature of the data registered, the\nscope of this processing, its technical characteristics and the\nconditions under which it may be consulted, the provisions of\n\nArticle 5\nviolate the right to respect for privacy in a manner\nwhich cannot be regarded as proportionate to the goal\npursued; that accordingly,\nArticles 5\nand\nof the act must be\nruled unconstitutional…” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nSubsequently, Law 2012-410 of March 27, 2012, on Identity Protection was\n\npublished in the official gazette of France, without\nArticles 3\nand\n, which had\n\nbeen rendered unconstitutional by the Council.377\n\n210 Aycaguer v France378 concerned the applicant’s refusal to undergo\n\nbiological testing, the result of which was to be included in the national\n\ncomputerised DNA database. As a result of his refusal, he was convicted.

The Court concluded that the regulations failed to\n\nstrike a balance between competing public and private interests and held,\n\nunanimously, that there had been a violation of\nArticle 8 (right to respect for\n\nprivate life)\nof the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n211 The Conseil d'Etat379 in Association pour la promotion de l'image 380\n\nwas asked whether a decree regulating the use and storage of data from\n\nbiometric passports was lawful. One of the stipulations of the decree was that\n\neight fingerprints were stored by the authorities, while only two were required\n\nfor the passport. The Conseil d'Etat stated that the collection and retention of\n\nsix more fingerprints to be centrally stored was irrelevant and excessive in\n\nrelation to the purpose of the computerized database.\n\n212 In Digital Rights Ireland Ltd v Minister,381 the Court of Justice of the\n\nEuropean Union held that the EU legislature had exceeded the limits of the\n\nprinciple of proportionality in relation to certain provisions of the Charter of\n\nFundamental Rights of the European Union –\nArticles 7\n, 8\nand\n52(1)\n– by\n\nadopting the Data Retention Directive. According to the Directive, member\n\nstates were obliged to store citizens’ telecommunications data for a minimum\n\nof 6 months and a maximum of 24 months. The Directive empowered police\n\n379The Conseil d’Etat (Council of State) is a body of the French government that acts as legal advisor of the\nexecutive branch and as the supreme court for administrative justice\n380 Conseil d’ Etat in France, 26 October 2011\n381 C‑293/12 and C‑594/12\nPART H\n\nand security agencies to request access to details such as IP address and\n\ntime of use of all e-mails, phone calls and text messages sent or received.\n\nThe Court applied the test of proportionality to the measures. It was noted\n\nthat metadata allows officials to make precise conclusions about a person’s\n\nprivate life, and dragnet data collection creates a chilling effect based on the\n\nsense that one’s life is subject to surveillance at all times. On the nature of\n\nmetadata, the Court observed that:\n\n“Taken as a whole, [metadata] may allow very precise\nconclusions to be drawn concerning the private lives of the\npersons whose data has been retained, such as the habits of\neveryday life, permanent or temporary places of residence,\ndaily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social\nrelationships of those persons and the social environments\nfrequented by them.”382\n\nThe Court found that surveillance serves an important public interest – public\n\nsecurity – and that the right to security is itself a fundamental right under\n\nArticle 6\nof the Charter.383 However, the Court adopted a two-pronged\n\nproportionality test to conclude that the Directive’s retention and access\n\nrequirements were not proportional to that interest.\n\n“…According to the settled case-law of the Court, the\nprinciple of proportionality requires that acts of the EU\ninstitutions be appropriate for attaining the legitimate\nobjectives pursued by the legislation at issue and do not\nexceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in\norder to achieve those objectives.”384\n\n382 Ibid, at para 27\n383 Ibid, at para 42\n384 Ibid, at para 46\nPART H\n\nThe retention measure was held to be unnecessary to fulfill the objective of\n\nfighting against serious crime:\n\n“As regards the necessity for the retention of data required by\nDirective 2006/24, it must be held that the fight against\nserious crime, in particular against organised crime and\nterrorism, is indeed of the utmost importance in order to\nensure public security and its effectiveness may depend to a\ngreat extent on the use of modern investigation techniques.\nHowever, such an objective of general interest, however\nfundamental it may be, does not, in itself, justify a\nretention measure such as that established by Directive\n2006/24 being considered to be necessary for the\npurpose of that fight. (Emphasis supplied)”385\n\nThe Court criticized the Directive for failing to lay down any clear or precise\n\nrules governing the extent of the interference with the fundamental rights\n\nenshrined in\nArticles 7\nand\nof the Charter. It observed that the Directive was\n\noverbroad because it applied to all data, regardless of the existence of\n\nsuspicion, and contained no criteria for limiting government access or\n\nsafeguards for preventing abuse:\n\n“…Directive 2006/24 covers, in a generalised manner, all\npersons and all means of electronic communication as well as\nall traffic data without any differentiation, limitation or\nexception being made in the light of the objective of fighting\nagainst serious crime…\n…Whilst seeking to contribute to the fight against serious\ncrime, Directive 2006/24 does not require any relationship\nbetween the data whose retention is provided for and a threat\nto public security and, in particular, it is not restricted to a\nretention in relation (i) to data pertaining to a particular time\nperiod and/or a particular geographical zone and/or to a circle\nof particular persons likely to be involved, in one way or\nanother, in a serious crime, or (ii) to persons who could, for\nother reasons, contribute, by the retention of their data, to the\nprevention, detection or prosecution of serious offences.”386\n“Not only is there a general absence of limits in Directive\n2006/24 but Directive 2006/24 also fails to lay down any\n\n385 Ibid, at para 51\n386 Ibid, at paras 57-59\nPART H\n\nobjective criterion by which to determine the limits of the\naccess of the competent national authorities to the data and\ntheir subsequent use for the purposes of prevention,\ndetection or criminal prosecutions concerning offences that, in\nview of the extent and seriousness of the interference with the\nfundamental rights enshrined in\nArticles 7\nand\nof the\nCharter, may be considered to be sufficiently serious to justify\nsuch an interference. On the contrary, Directive 2006/24\nsimply refers, in\nArticle 1(1)\n, in a general manner to serious\ncrime, as defined by each Member State in its national\nlaw.”387\n\nThe Court concluded that the Directive failed to set out “clear and precise\n\nrules”388 for access or for how states should judge the period of time for which\n\ndata should be held, and “entails a wide-ranging and particularly serious\n\ninterference with those fundamental rights in the legal order of the EU, without\n\nsuch an interference being precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure\n\nthat it is actually limited to what is strictly necessary.”389 The Court struck\n\ndown the Directive on the basis of the scope of the data to be retained, 390 the\n\nlack of limits imposed on state access,391 and the failure to distinguish\n\nbetween the treatment of data based on its usefulness and relevance.392\n\nOf crucial importance is the Court’s emphasis that the judicial review of the EU\n\nlegislature’s discretion “should be strict” because of “the important role played\n\nby the protection of personal data in the light of the fundamental right to\n\nrespect for private life and the extent and seriousness of the interference with\n\n387 Ibid, at para 60\n388 Ibid, at para 54\n389 Ibid, at para 65\n390 Ibid, at paras 56 –58\n391 Ibid, at paras 60-62\n392 Ibid, at paras 59, 63– 64\nPART H\n\nthat right caused by Directive 2006/24”.393 In addition, the Court emphasized\n\nthat even highly important objectives such as the fight against serious crime\n\nand terrorism cannot justify measures which lead to forms of interference that\n\ngo beyond what is ‘strictly necessary’.394\n\n213 In Michael Schwarz v Stadt Bochum,395 the Court of Justice of the\n\nEuropean Union was called upon to examine the validity of a provision in a\n\nCouncil Regulation that obliged persons applying for a passport to provide\n\nfingerprints which would be stored in that passport. In considering whether this\n\nregulation was valid and necessary, the Court observed:\n\n“…Article 1(2) of Regulation No 2252/2004 does not provide\nfor the storage of fingerprints except within the passport\nitself, which belongs to the holder alone.396\nThe regulation not providing for any other form or\nmethod of storing those fingerprints, it cannot in and of\nitself…be interpreted as providing a legal basis for the\ncentralised storage of data collected thereunder or for\nthe use of such data for purposes other than that of\npreventing illegal entry into the European Union.397\nIn those circumstances, the arguments put forward by the\nreferring court concerning the risks linked to possible\ncentralisation cannot, in any event, affect the validity of that\nregulation and would have, should the case arise, to be\nexamined in the course of an action brought before the\ncompetent courts against legislation providing for a\ncentralised fingerprint base. In the light of the foregoing, it\nmust be held that\nArticle 1(2)\nof Regulation No 2252/2004\ndoes not imply any processing of fingerprints that would go\nbeyond what is necessary in order to achieve the aim of\nprotecting against the fraudulent use of passports. It follows\nthat the interference arising from\nArticle 1(2)\nof Regulation No\n2252/2004 is justified by its aim of protecting against the\nfraudulent use of passports.”398\n\n393 Ibid, at para 48\n394 Ibid, at para 51\n395 [2013] EUECJ C-291/12\n396 Ibid, at para 60\n397 Ibid, at para 61\n398 Ibid, at para 62\nPART H\n\nThe Court held that although the taking and storing of fingerprints in passports\n\nconstituted an infringement of the right to respect for private life and the right\n\nto protection of personal data,\nArticle 1(2)\nof Regulation No 2252/2004 did not\n\nimply any processing of fingerprints that would go beyond what is necessary\n\nin order to achieve the aim of protecting against the fraudulent use of\n\npassports and was therefore valid.\n\n214 In Madhewoo v The State of Mauritius,399 the Judicial Committee of\n\nthe Privy Council heard an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of\n\nMauritius regarding the constitutionality of the provisions of The National\n\nIdentity Card (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2013.\nThe Act\nrequired biometric\n\ninformation including fingerprints, to be stored in a central register in which\n\nparticulars of the identity of every citizen of Mauritius were to be recorded.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld provisions of the Act that provided for the\n\ncompulsory taking of fingerprints. However, the Court struck down those\n\nprovisions that provided for the biometric data to be stored in a central\n\nregister. The Appellant appealed to the Committee, contending that the\n\nprovisions providing for the compulsory taking of fingerprints should also be\n\nstruck down as unconstitutional.\n\nThe appellant challenged the following provisions of the Act: (i) the storage of\n\ndata in a register in electronic data under\nSection 3\n; (ii) the obligation to\n399 [2016] UKPC 30\nPART H\n\nprovide biometric information under\nSection 4\n; (iii) the collection of\n\ninformation, in electronic form, for a national ID card under\nSection 5\n; (iv) the\n\ncompulsory production of an identity card to a policeman under\nSection 7(1A)\n\nin response to a request under\nSection 7(1)(b)\n; and (v) the gravity of the\n\npotential penalties for non-compliance under\nSection 9(3)\n, before the\n\nMauritian Supreme Court. The challenge was on the ground that the\n\nimplementation of the biometric identity card and the permanent storage of\n\nbiometric data contravened provisions of the Mauritian Constitution and the\n\nCivil Code.\n\nRegarding the challenge to\nSection 4 (2)(c)\nof the Act, which provided that,\n\n“every person who applies for an identity card shall allow his fingerprints, and\n\nother biometric information about himself, to be taken and recorded … for the\n\npurpose of the identity card,” the Supreme Court noted that the right to privacy\n\nunder\nSection 9(1)\nof the Constitution was not an absolute right and\n\ninterference with that right could be permitted under\nSection 9(2)\n, if a law that\n\ninterfered with that right was in the interest, inter alia, of public order. The\n\nCommittee noted the Supreme Court’s approach to determining whether\n\nSection 4(2)(c)\nfell foul of the Constitution, which was based on the test laid\n\ndown in S and Marper v The United Kingdom400:\n\n“In addressing the question whether section 4(2)(c) of the\n1985 Act (as amended) was reasonably justifiable in a\ndemocratic society the Supreme Court drew on jurisprudence\nof the European Court of Human Rights in S v The United\nKingdom…In substance the Court asked whether the\n\n400 [2008] ECHR 1581\nPART H\n\nmeasure pursued a legitimate aim, whether the reasons given\nby the national authorities for the interference in pursuit of\nthat aim were relevant and sufficient, and whether the\nmeasure was proportionate to the aim pursued. This\nevaluation is essentially the same as that adopted by the\ncourts in the United Kingdom in relation to\narticle 8(2)\nof the\nECHR, in which the courts ask themselves (a) whether the\nmeasure is in accordance with the law, (ii) whether it pursues\na legitimate aim, and (iii) whether the measure will give rise to\ninterferences with fundamental rights which are\ndisproportionate, having regard to the legitimate aim pursued.\nIn relation to (iii), the courts ask themselves: (a) whether the\nobjective is sufficiently important to justify a limitation of the\nprotected right, (b) whether the measure is rationally\nconnected to the objective, (c) whether a less intrusive\nmeasure could have been used without compromising the\nachievement of the objective (in other words, whether the\nlimitation on the fundamental right was one which it was\nreasonable for the legislature to impose), and (d) whether the\nimpact of the infringement of the protected rights is\ndisproportionate to the likely benefit of the measure”\n\nThe Committee reproduced the Mauritian Supreme Court’s holding that the\n\nprovisions of the Act which enforced the compulsory taking and recording of\n\nfingerprints interfered with the Appellant’s rights guaranteed under\nsection\n\n9(1)\nof the Constitution,401 but that the law was justifiable on grounds of public\n\ninterest and public order:\n\n“We find that it can hardly be disputed that the taking of\nfingerprints within the applicable legal framework pursues the\nlegitimate purpose of establishing a sound and secure identity\nprotection system for the nation and thus answers a pressing\nsocial need affording indispensable protection against identity\nfraud. Such a purpose, as has been amply demonstrated, is\nvital for proper law enforcement in Mauritius. Furthermore,\ntaking into consideration the appropriate safeguards in the\ntaking of fingerprints for their insertion in the cards, and the\nrelatively limited degree of interference involved, we are led to\nconclude that such interference is proportionate to the\nlegitimate aim pursued.”402\n\n401 Maharajah Madhewoo v. The State of Mauritius & Anr., 2015 SCJ 177, at page 23\n402 [2016] UKPC 30, at page 10\nPART H\n\nThus, the Mauritian Supreme Court upheld provisions of the Act which\n\nprovided for the compulsory taking of fingerprints. The Appellant also\n\nchallenged\nSection 3\nof the Act, which provided for biometric data to be stored\n\nin a register. The Supreme Court, after taking into consideration witness\n\ntestimonies on the purpose of data collection, noted that though there may\n\nhave been a legitimate aim for storing and collecting this data, “sufficiently\n\nstrong reasons…to establish that such storage and retention of data for an\n\nindefinite period is proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued” were not\n\nestablished.403 Thus, the Court held that:\n\n“… it is inconceivable that there can be such uncontrolled\naccess to personal data in the absence of the vital safeguards\nafforded by judicial control. The potential for misuse or abuse\nof the exercise of the powers granted under the law would be\nsignificantly disproportionate to the legitimate aim which the\ndefendants have claimed in order to justify the retention and\nstorage of personal data under the Data Protection Act.”404\n\nThus, while the Supreme Court noted that the law providing for the storage\n\nand retention of personal biometric data constituted a permissible derogation\n\nunder\nSection 9(2)\nof the Constitution,405 it held that since the Respondent had\n\nnot established that provisions dealing with storage and retention were\n\nreasonably justifiable in a democratic society, they were unconstitutional.\n\n403 Ibid, at page 31\n404 Ibid, at page 33\nArticle 9.\nProtection of privacy of home and other property: (2) Nothing contained in or done under the authority\nof any law shall be held to be consistent with or in contravention of this section to the extent that the law in\nquestion makes provision - (a) in the interests of defence, public safety, public order, public morality, public\nhealth, town and country planning, the development or utilisation of mineral resources or the development or\nutilisation of any other property in such a manner as to promote the public benefit; (b) for the purpose of\nprotecting the rights or freedoms of other persons; (c) to enable an officer or agent of the government or a local\nauthority, or a body corporate established by law for public purpose, to enter on the premises of any person in\norder to value those premises for the purpose of any tax, rate or due, or in order to carry out work connected\nwith any property that is lawfully on those premises and that belongs to the government, the local authority or\nthat body corporate, as the case may be; or (d) to authorise, for the purpose of enforcing the judgement or\norder of a court in any civil proceedings, the search of any person or property by order of a court or the entry\nupon any premises by such order, Except so far as that provision or, as the case may be, the thing done under\nits authority is shown not to be reasonably justifiable in a democratic society\nPART H\n\nThe Judicial Committee did not interfere with the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nHowever, it noted an inconsistency in the Supreme Court’s order wherein it\n\nheld that the law providing for the storage and retention of fingerprints and\n\nother biometric data constitutes a permissible derogation under\nsection 9(2)\nof\n\nthe Constitution, whilst simultaneously holding the same provisions to be\n\nunconstitutional. The Committee reconciled the holding to be:\n\n“A law providing for the storage and retention of fingerprints\nand other personal biometric data regarding the identity of a\nperson in principle constitutes a permissible derogation, in\nthe interests of public order, under\nsection 9(2)\nof the\nConstitution.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n215 The learned Attorney General has relied on cases from other\n\njurisdictions to buttress his contention that the collection and use of biometric\n\ninformation for various services have been found to be legal. ‘Biometric\n\ndata406’ is defined in the General Data Protection Regulation thus:\n\n“personal data resulting from specific technical processing\nrelating to the physical, physiological or behavioural\ncharacteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the\nunique identification of that natural person, such as facial\nimages or dactyloscopic data.”\n\nThe learned Attorney General cited the following judgments of the US\n\nSupreme Court: Vernonia School District 47J v Acton (“Acton”),407 Skinner\n\nv Railway Labor Executives’ Association (“Skinner”),408 Whalen v Roe\n\n(“Whalen”),409 United States v Dionisio (“Dionisio”)410 and Bowen v Roy\nArticle 4(14)\n407 515\nU.S. 646 (1995)\n408 489 U.S. 602 (1989)\n409 429 U.S. 589 (1977)\n410 410 U.\nS. 1 (1973)\nPART H\n\n(“Bowen”).411 Only Acton, Skinner and Dionisio were decided in the context\n\nof biometrics, which as we have found before, forms the bedrock of the\n\nAadhaar program. In Acton, the court held that the action of the authorities\n\nconducting random drug testing of high school athletes was legal since the\n\nconditions of collection were nearly identical to those typically encountered in\n\npublic restrooms. As a result, it was found that, privacy interests of the\n\nstudents were negligibly affected. In Skinner, the court found the actions of\n\nthe Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) requiring mandatory blood and\n\nurine testing of employees involved in train accidents to be constitutional. The\n\ncourt observed that railroad accidents, if not prevented, could cause massive\n\nloss of life and property. Further, it was held that FRA’s regulations fulfilled a\n\n“special need” because of the interest of the government in ensuring safety of\n\nrailroads and were therefore, not “an undue infringement on the justifiable\n\nexpectations of privacy of covered employees”. In Whalen, the Court found\n\nthat retention of patients’ information such as their name, address and age,\n\nunder the New York State Controlled Substances Act, 1972, was not in\n\nviolation of the constitutional right to privacy as the Court was satisfied that the\n\nstatute provided for proper safeguards and redressal against theft and loss of\n\ninformation. In Dionisio, the Court found no constitutional infirmity with the\n\nissuance of a subpoena to procure voice recording exhibits by tapping\n\ntelephones in order to investigate crimes. The Court held that “neither the\n\nsummons to appear before the grand jury, nor its directive to make a voice\n\nrecording, infringed upon any interest protected by the Fourth Amendment”.\n411 476 U.S. 693 (1986)\nPART H\n\nThe Court observed that a compelled display of identifiable physical\n\ncharacteristics does not infringe upon an “interest protected by the privilege\n\nagainst compulsory self-incrimination”. In Bowen, the Court upheld the\n\nprovisions of a welfare scheme which required citizens to furnish their social\n\nsecurity number, rejecting the argument that the use of a social security\n\nnumber violated the Appellant’s Native American beliefs. The Court held that\n\nthe Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment could not be construed to\n\nplace a requirement on the government to conduct its internal affairs in\n\nconsonance with the religious beliefs of particular citizens.\n\nIn In re Crawford,412 the Ninth Circuit upheld provisions of the Bankruptcy\n\nCode which mandated public disclosure of a Bankruptcy Petition Preparers’\n\nSocial Security Number on documents submitted to the Court, noting that the\n\nprovision had been enacted to serve governmental interests of preventing\n\nfraud and providing public access to judicial proceedings.\n\n216 Some decisions of lower courts in the US which have considered the\n\nvalidity of laws or actions of the State deploying biometrics and which have\n\nbeen cited by the respondents are: Haskell v Harris (“Haskell”),413 Utility\n\nWorkers Union of America v Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n\n(“UWUA”),414 Nicholas A Iacobucci v City of Newport (“Iacobucci”),415\n\n412 194 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 1999)\n413 669 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2012)\n414 664 F. Supp. 136 (S.D.N.Y. 1987)\n415 785 F.2d 1354 (6th Cir. 1986)\nPART H\n\nThom v New York Stock Exchange (“Thom”),416 Perkey v Department of\n\nMotor Vehicles (“Perkey”),417 Buchanan v Wing (Buchanan),418 People v\n\nStuller (“Stuller”),419 United States v Kelly (“Kelly”)420 and Brown v\n\nBrannon (“Brannon”).421 At first blush, it does seem that these cases support\n\nthe Respondents’ stand, however, we cannot lose sight of the context in which\n\nthe courts came to the conclusion emphasised by the respondents in support\n\nof their submissions. In Haskell, the Ninth Circuit found a Californian law\n\nwhich authorized law enforcement officers to collect DNA in the form of a\n\nsample from the buccal swab of the mouth of felony arrestees, who had not\n\nbeen convicted, to be constitutional. The Court noted that the arrestees had\n\nreduced privacy interests; the physical intrusion of collecting a buccal swab\n\nwas de minimis in nature; there were stringent limits on the manner in which\n\nthe information was to be used; and the interest of the State in deterring future\n\ncriminal acts to exculpate innocent arrestees aided in prison administration\n\nand law enforcement. For the above reasons, the Court found that the\n\ninfringement of privacy of the felony arrestees was justified. In UWUA, the\n\nNinth Circuit ruled that a law requiring individuals working in nuclear power\n\nfacilities to submit their fingerprints for identification and criminal history record\n\nchecks was not unconstitutional. In Iacobucci, an ordinance which required\n\nemployees of liquor selling establishments which permitted nude dancing, to\n\nbe fingerprinted and photographed by the police department, was held\n\n416 306 F. Supp. 1002 (S.D.N.Y. 1969)\n417 (1986) 42 Cal. 3d 185\n418 N.Y.S.2d 865\nCal. App.3d 582 (1970)\n420 55 F.2d 67 (2d Cir. 1932)\n421 399 F. Supp. 133 (M.D.N.C. 1975)\nPART H\n\nconstitutional. The Court observed that fingerprinting and photographing of\n\nemployees of retail liquor establishments bore a rational relationship to the\n\nlegitimate aim of elimination of crime. In Thom, a New York statute, which as\n\na condition of employment, required all the employees of member firms of\n\nnational stock exchanges to be fingerprinted, was upheld. The Court ruled that\n\nfingerprinting was a necessary means of verifying the existence or non-\n\nexistence of a prior criminal record, in order to avert any threat posed by an\n\nemployee who was in a position to commit theft of securities. In Perkey, the\n\nCalifornian Supreme Court upheld the actions of the state mandating an\n\nindividual to provide a fingerprint in order to obtain a driver’s license. The\n\nCourt held that fingerprint technology was the only reliable means of ensuring\n\nthe integrity of the records of the department of motor vehicles as other\n\nmethods such as handwriting specimens and photographs were not reliable.\n\nThus, the submission of fingerprints as part of the license application process,\n\nbore a rational relationship to the State’s goal of promoting safe and lawful\n\nuse of highways. In Buchanan, the Court upheld the eligibility requirement for\n\na welfare aid scheme which mandated participation in an identity verification\n\nprocedure known as Automated Finger Imaging System (AFIS), rejecting the\n\nchallenge based on religious beliefs of the Petitioner. The Court held that the\n\nPetitioner had failed to prove that the AFIS involved any invasive procedures,\n\nnoting that she had acknowledged that she had never seen finger imaging\n\nperformed and had no idea whether a laser was involved. In Stuller, the\n\nconstitutionality of a law which required “temporary and itinerant classes of\nPART H\n\nemployees” to undergo fingerprinting in order to protect “visitors and\n\nresidents” of a resort city from crime and loss, both against people and against\n\nproperty, was upheld. In Kelly, the Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a claim\n\nfor return of fingerprints of the defendant which had been obtained after he\n\nhad been arrested by prohibition agents, holding that there was no reason to\n\ninterfere with a method of identifying persons “charged with a crime”. In\n\nBrannon, the court held that a law requiring “massagists” to submit their\n\nfingerprints, photographs and reports of their medical examinations in order to\n\nobtain licenses was valid, noting that the fingerprints and photographs would\n\naid in their identification as well as in the enforcement of criminal statutes\n\nrelating to public morality and decency.\n\n217 The cases cited by the learned Attorney General would not be\n\napplicable in the context of the Aadhaar program. The cases cited dealt with\n\nnarrowly tailored legislations set out to achieve very specific objectives. For\n\ninstance, courts upheld statutes aimed at protecting a nuclear facility or to\n\nprevent theft of securities, where incidents of sabotage or breach of security\n\nwould have led to national disasters. These national disasters in turn would\n\nhave resulted in the immediate loss of human life or in a situation of financial\n\nemergency. Such laws, were therefore, enacted in order to assuage security\n\nconcerns which, if not implemented, could lead to incidents of massive losses\n\nof life and property.\nPART H\n\nSome of the statutes upheld, permitted collection of DNA samples, fingerprints\n\nand photographs for identification. The objective behind these laws was\n\nprevention of crime, albeit on a comparatively smaller scale. Moreover, the\n\ncourts in these cases were also satisfied that the procedures involved in\n\ncollecting biometrics were not invasive enough to strike them down as\n\nunconstitutional or that there were adequate safeguards to prevent misuse.\n\nThe aforementioned cases will not apply in the backdrop of the Aadhaar\n\nprogram because they were rendered broadly in the context of prevention of\n\ncrime. It needs no reiteration that an entire population cannot be presumed to\n\nbe siphoning huge sums of money in welfare schemes or viewed through the\n\nlens of criminality, and therefore, considered as having a diminished\n\nexpectation of privacy. The judgments cited by the respondents which were\n\ndecided in the context of crime, require the State to at least form a reasonable\n\nbelief about the criminal antecedents of individuals or their potential to commit\n\ncrimes. On the contrary, by collecting identity information, the Aadhaar\n\nprogram treats every citizen as a potential criminal without even requiring the\n\nState to draw a reasonable belief that a citizen might be perpetrating a crime\n\nor an identity fraud. When the State is not required to have a reasonable belief\n\nand judicial determination to this effect, a program like Aadhaar, which\n\ninfringes on the justifiable expectations of privacy of citizens flowing from the\n\nConstitution, is completely disproportionate to the objective sought to be\n\nachieved by the State.\nPART H\n\n218 The fundamental precepts of proportionality, as they emerge from\n\ndecided cases can be formulated thus:\n\n1. A law interfering with fundamental rights must be in pursuance of a\n\nlegitimate state aim;\n\n2. The justification for rights-infringing measures that interfere with or limit the\n\nexercise of fundamental rights and liberties must be based on the\n\nexistence of a rational connection between those measures, the situation in\n\nfact and the object sought to be achieved;\n\n3. The measures must be necessary to achieve the object and must not\n\ninfringe rights to an extent greater than is necessary to fulfil the aim;\n\n4. Restrictions must not only serve a legitimate purposes; they must also be\n\nnecessary to protect them; and\n\n5. The State must provide sufficient safeguards relating to the storing and\n\nprotection of centrally stored data. In order to prevent arbitrary or abusive\n\ninterference with privacy, the State must guarantee that the collection and\n\nuse of personal information is based on the consent of the individual; that it\n\nis authorised by law and that sufficient safeguards exist to ensure that the\n\ndata is only used for the purpose specified at the time of collection.\n\nOwnership of the data must at all times vest in the individual whose data is\n\ncollected. The individual must have a right of access to the data collected\n\nand the discretion to opt out.\nPART H\n\n219 Privacy and proportionality are two interlocking themes that recur\n\nconsistently in the above judgements. Privacy, also construed as\n\n“informational self-determination”, is a fundamental value. There is a\n\nconsistent emphasis on the impact on personal dignity if private information is\n\nwidely available and individuals are not able to decide upon its disclosure and\n\nuse. This right of controlling the extent of the availability and use of one’s\n\npersonal data is seen as a building block of data protection - especially in an\n\nenvironment where the state of technology facilitates ease of collection,\n\nanalysis and dissemination of information.\n\n220 The blanket and indiscriminate collection of information is seen as a\n\nviolation of privacy, which is a constituent of the right to liberty. An extensive\n\npower to retain collected data is also seen as a disproportionate interference\n\nwith the right to privacy and not necessary in a democratic society. The\n\njudgments hold that unlimited data retention and unrestricted state access\n\nboth constitute a disproportionate interference with privacy and data\n\nprotection. They also emphasize the need to clearly stipulate the nature of the\n\ndata being collected and ensure its confidentiality. Provisions where these\n\nprinciples are not respected cannot be regarded as valid. While courts do\n\nrecognize the need for public order and security, they emphasize the need to\n\nstrike a balance between safeguarding public order and the right to privacy.\nPART H\n\n221 The principle of proportionality also recurs through these judgments,\n\nwhich note that the collection and use of information must be limited to the\n\npurpose specified by law and to the extent indispensable for the protection of\n\npublic interest. The striking of a balance between public and private interests\n\nis crucial to proportionality. The judgments hold that there must be a\n\nprotection against unauthorized use and clearly defined conditions for\n\nprocessing of data collected. Those conditions must not be excessive and\n\nmust be justified on grounds of public interest and implemented in a manner\n\nproportionate to the objective. Too broad a scope of data collected and\n\nretained, the lack of limits imposed on access to data by authorities and a\n\nfailure to distinguish between the treatment of data based on its usefulness\n\nand relevance are seen by Courts as constituting grounds for striking down\n\nthe measure. While the State's imperatives are seen as relevant, emphasis is\n\nlaid on retention and access requirements being proportionate to those\n\nimperatives and the need to prevent against abuse. Courts have upheld\n\nregulations that are necessary to achieve the legitimate aims and not\n\nexcessive in their nature or impact.\n\nThe issue is whether the Aadhaar project and the Act, Rules and Regulations\n\nmeet the test of proportionality.\nPART H\n\nH.4 Aadhaar: the proportionality analysis\n\n222 Under Aadhaar, the State has put forth an objective of transferring\n\nsubsidies and entitlements to its citizens. The aim was to curb leakages and\n\nto increase transparent and efficient “targeted delivery of subsidies, benefits\n\nand services”. However, the Act in the present form has surpassed a tailored\n\nobjective and has sought to administer every facet of the citizen-state\n\nengagement through mandatory biometric-enabled Aadhaar linking. The\n\nviolations of fundamental rights that result from the operation of the Aadhaar\n\nscheme will have to be evaluated on the touchstone of legitimate state\n\ninterest and proportionality.\n\nSince biometric systems have been employed, it is fundamental to understand\n\nthat the right to privacy and its protection must be at the centre of the debate,\n\nfrom the very onset of the decision to use biometric data. It is vital that\n\nadequate safeguards are set down for every step of the process from\n\ncollection to retention of biometric data. At the time of collection, individuals\n\nmust be informed about the collection procedure, the intended purpose of the\n\ncollection, the reason why the particular data set is requested and who will\n\nhave access to their data. Additionally, the retention period must be justified\n\nand individuals must be given the right to access, correct and delete their data\n\nat any point in time, a procedure familiar to an opt-out option. The intended\n\npurpose should always act as a shining light and adequate caution must be\nPART H\n\ntaken to ensure that there is no function creep with the lapse of time, in order\n\nto prevent the use of the data for new, originally unintended purposes.\n\nMeasures to protect privacy would include enacting more entrenched and\n\nspecific legislation so that the right to privacy is not only recognized but\n\nprotected in all its aspects. Meeting this obligation would necessarily mean\n\nenactment of data protection legislation as well. The choice of particular\n\ntechniques and the role of components in the architecture of the technology\n\nalso have a strong impact on the privacy protections provided by the biometric\n\nsystem.\n\nDuring the course of the hearing, the CEO of UIDAI, Mr Ajay Bhushan Pandey\n\nwas permitted on the request of the learned Attorney General to make a\n\npower-point presentation before the Court, explaining the architecture and\n\nworking of the Aadhaar project. On the basis of the presentation, Mr Shyam\n\nDivan, counsel for the petitioners had served a list of questions to the\n\nrespondents. Responses to these questions have been filed by UIDAI.\n\nAnalysing the power-point presentation by the CEO, questions addressed by\n\nMr Divan and the responses filed by the respondents will facilitate an\n\nunderstanding of the architecture of the Aadhaar project.\n\nOur analysis indicates that the correctness of the documents submitted by an\n\nindividual at the stage of enrolment or while updating information is not\n\nverified by any official of UIDAI or of the Government. UIDAI does not take\nPART H\n\ninstitutional responsibility for the correctness of the information entering its\n\ndatabase. It delegates this task to the enrolment agency or the Registrar. The\n\nfollowing response has been submitted by the respondents to the queries\n\naddressed specifically on this aspect:\n\n“As per UIDAI process, the verification of the documents is\nentrusted to the Registrar. For Verification based on\nDocuments, the verifier present at the Enrolment Centre will\nverify the documents. Registrars/Enrolment agency must\nappoint personnel for the verification of documents.”\n\n223 UIDAI does not identify the persons who enrol within the Aadhaar\n\nsystem. Once the biometric information is stored in the CIDR during\n\nenrolment, it is only matched with the information received at the time of\n\nauthentication. Biometric authentication of an Aadhaar number holder is\n\nperformed as a “one to one” biometric match against the biometric information\n\nof the Aadhaar number holder in CIDR. Based on the match, UIDAI provides\n\na ‘yes’ or ‘no’response. Whether the information which is entering into CIDR is\n\ncorrect or not is a task entrusted to the enrolling agency or the Registrars.\n\nUIDAI does not assume responsibility for it.\n\nThe task of verifying whether a person is an illegal resident has also been left\n\nto the enrolling agencies. At the stage of enrolment, a verification of whether a\n\nperson has been residing in India for 182 days or more in the past twelve\n\nmonths is done on the basis of a ‘self-declaration’ of the individual. The\n\ndeclaration which has been provided in the Aadhaar enrolment forms is thus:\nPART H\n\n“Disclosure under section 3(2) of The Aadhaar (Targeted\nDelivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and\nServìces Act, 2016\nI confirm that I have been residing in India for at least 182\ndays in the preceding 12 months & information (including\nbiometrics) provided by me to the UIDAI Ìs my own and is\ntrue, correct and accurate. I am aware that my information\nincluding biometrics will be tested for generation of Aadhaar\nand authentication. I understand that my identity information\n(except core biometric) may be provided to an agency only\nwith my consent during authentication or as per the provisions\nof the Aadhaar Act. I have a right to access my identity\ninformation (except core biometrics) following the procedure\nlaid down by UIDAI.”422\n\n224 The petitioners have argued that persons who were enrolled under the\n\nAadhaar programme before the Act came into force on 12 September 2016\n\n(more than a hundred crore) were not even required to make this declaration.\n\nThe authenticity of the documents submitted (along with the declaration) is not\n\nchecked by UIDAI.\n\nThe exception handling process permitting the use of alternative modes of\n\nidentification if the Aadhaar authentication fails, is also left to the discretion of\n\nthe Requesting Entity. On this aspect, the response which has been provided\n\nto the Court is thus:\n\n“As per\nRegulation 14(i)\nof Aadhaar (Authentication)\nRegulations 2016, requesting entities shall implement\nexception-handling mechanisms and back-up identity\nauthentication mechanisms to ensure seamless provision of\nauthentication services to Aadhaar number holders.\nTherefore, this exception handling mechanism is to be\nimplemented and monitored by the requesting entities and in\ncase of the government, their respective ministries.”\nPART H\n\nForty-nine thousand enrolment operators have been blacklisted by UIDAI. In\n\nreply to the question of the petitioners asking the reasons for blacklisting of\n\nthe enrolment operators, UIDAI has stated that a data quality check is done\n\nduring the enrolment process and if any Aadhaar enrolment is found to be not\n\nto be compliant with the UIDAI process, the enrolment gets rejected and an\n\nAadhaar number is not generated. An operator who crosses a threshold\n\ndefined in the policy, is blacklisted/ removed from the UIDAI ecosystem.\n\nUIDAI has provided information that forty-nine thousand operators were\n\nblacklisted/removed from the UIDAI ecosystem for the following reasons: (a)\n\nillegally charging residents for Aadhaar enrolment; (b) poor demographic data\n\nquality; (c) invalid biometric exceptions; and (d) other process malpractices.\n\nOnce an operator is blacklisted or suspended, further enrolments cannot be\n\ncarried out by it until the order of blacklisting/suspension is valid.\n\n225 The Aadhaar architecture incorporates the role of Authentication User\n\nAgencies (AUAs) and Authentication Service Agencies (ASAs). ASAs, under\n\nthe Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, have been defined as entities\n\nproviding necessary infrastructure for ensuring secure network connectivity\n\nand related services for enabling a requesting entity to perform authentication\n\nusing the authentication facility provided by UIDAI.423 AUAs have been\n\ndefined under the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations as requesting entities\n\nthat use the Yes/No authentication facility provided by UIDAI. 424 “Yes/No\nRegulation 2(f)\n, Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations\nRegulation 2(g)\n, Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations\nPART H\n\nauthentication facility” is a type of authentication facility in which the identity\n\ninformation and Aadhaar number securely submitted with the consent of the\n\nAadhaar number holder through a requesting entity, are matched against the\n\ndata available in the CIDR, and the Authority responds with a digitally signed\n\nresponse containing a “Yes” or “No”, along with other technical details related\n\nto the authentication transaction, excluding identity information.425 The other\n\ntype of authentication facility is the e-KYC authentication facility, in which the\n\nbiometric information and/or OTP and Aadhaar number securely submitted\n\nwith the consent of the Aadhaar number holder through a requesting entity,\n\nare matched against the data available in the CIDR, and the Authority returns\n\na digitally signed response containing e-KYC data along with other technical\n\ndetails related to the authentication transaction. A requesting entity which, in\n\naddition to being an AUA, uses e-KYC authentication facility provided by\n\nUIDAI is called a “e-KYC User Agency” or “KUA”.426 Under\nRegulation 15(2)\n, a\n\nrequesting agency may permit any other agency or entity to perform Yes/ No\n\nauthentication by generating and sharing a separate license key for every\n\nsuch entity through the portal provided by UIDAI to the said requesting entity.\n\nIt has also been clarified that sharing of a license key is only permissible for\n\nperforming Yes/ No authentication, and is prohibited in case of e-KYC\n\nauthentication.427\nRegulation 2(p)\n, Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations\nRegulation 2(l)\n, Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations\nRegulation 15\n, Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations\nPART H\n\nThe petitioners have contended that the points of service (PoS) biometric\n\nreaders are capable of storing biometric information. The response which\n\nUIDAI has provided is extracted below:\n\n“UIDAI has mandated use of Registered Devices (RD) for all\nauthentication requests. With Registered Devices biometric\ndata is signed within the device/ RD service using the\nprovider key to ensure it is indeed captured live. The device\nprovider RD Service encrypts the PID block before returning\nto the host application. This RD Service encapsulates the\nbiometric capture, signing and encryption of biometrics all\nwithin it. Therefore, introduction of RD in Aadhaar\nauthentication system rules out any possibility of use of\nstored biometric and replay of biometrics captured from other\nsource. Requesting entities are not legally allowed to store\nbiometrics captured for Aadhaar authentication under\n\nRegulation 17(1)(a)\nof Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations\n2016.”\n\n226 A PID block is defined in\nRegulation 2(n)\nof Aadhaar (Authentication)\n\nRegulations, 2016 as the Personal Identity Data element, which includes\n\nnecessary demographic and/or biometric and/or OTP collected from the\n\nAadhaar number holder during authentication.\nRegulation 17(1)(c)\nallows the\n\nrequesting entity to store the PID block when “it is for buffered authentication\n\nwhere it may be held temporarily on the authentication device for a short\n\nperiod of time, and that the same is deleted after transmission”. Thus, under\n\nthe Aadhaar project, requesting entities can hold the identity information of\n\nindividuals, even if for a temporary period.\n\nIt was further contended by the petitioners that authentication entities in the\n\nAadhaar architecture are capable of recording the date and time of the\n\nauthentication, the client IP, the device ID and purpose of authentication. In\nPART H\n\nresponse, UIDAI stated that it does not ask requesting entities to maintain any\n\nlogs related to the IP address of the device, GPS coordinates of the device\n\nand purpose of authentication. It was, however, admitted that in order to\n\nensure that their systems are secure and frauds are managed, AUAs like\n\nbanks and telecom providers may store additional information according to\n\ntheir requirement to secure their system.\n\n227 The process of sending authentication requests has been dealt with in\n\nRegulation 9\nof the Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations. It provides that\n\nafter collecting the Aadhaar number or any other identifier provided by the\n\nrequesting entity which is mapped to the Aadhaar number and necessary\n\ndemographic and / or biometric information and/ or OTP from the Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder, the client application immediately packages and encrypts the\n\ninput parameters into the PID block before transmission and sends it to the\n\nserver of the requesting entity using secure protocols. After validation, the\n\nserver of a requesting entity passes the authentication request to the CIDR,\n\nthrough the server of the Authentication Service Agency. The Regulation\n\nfurther provides that the authentication request must be digitally signed by the\n\nrequesting entity and/or by the Authentication Service Agency, pursuant to the\n\nmutual agreement between them. Based on the mode of authentication\n\nrequested, the CIDR validates the input parameters against the data stored\n\nand returns a digitally signed Yes or No authentication response, or a digitally\n\nsigned e-KYC authentication response with encrypted e-KYC data, as the\nPART H\n\ncase may be, along with other technical details related to the authentication\n\ntransaction. In all modes of authentication, the Aadhaar number is mandatory\n\nand is submitted along with the input parameters such that authentication is\n\nalways reduced to a 1:1 match. Clause (5) of\nRegulation 9\nprovides that a\n\nrequesting entity shall ensure that encryption of PID Block takes place at the\n\ntime of capture on the authentication device according to the processes and\n\nspecifications\nlaid down by\nUIDAI.\nRegulation 18(1)\nprovides that a requesting\n\nentity would maintain logs of the authentication transactions processed by it,\n\ncontaining the following transaction details:\n\n(a) the Aadhaar number against which authentication is sought;\n\n(b) specified parameters of authentication request submitted;\n\n(c) specified parameters received as authentication response;\n\n(d) the record of disclosure of information to the Aadhaar number holder at the\n\ntime of authentication; and\n\n(e) record of consent of the Aadhaar number holder for authentication.\n\nThe provision excludes retention of PID information in any case. Regulations\n\n18(2) and 18(3) allow the retention of the logs of authentication transactions\n\nby the requesting entity for a period of two years. Upon the expiry of two years\n\nthe logs have to be archived for a period of five years or the number of years\n\nrequired by the laws or regulations governing the entity, whichever is later.\n\nUpon the expiry of this period, the logs shall be deleted except those records\n\nwhich are required to be retained by a court or for any pending disputes.\n\nRegulation 20(1)\nprovides that an Authentication Service Agency would\nPART H\n\nmaintain logs of the authentication transactions processed by it, containing\n\nthe following transaction details:\n\n(a) identity of the requesting entity;\n\n(b) parameters of authentication request submitted; and\n\n(c) parameters received as authentication response.\n\nThe Regulation excludes retention of Aadhaar number, PID information,\n\ndevice identity related data and e-KYC response data. Under Regulations\n\n20(2) and 20(3), authentication logs shall be maintained by the ASA for a\n\nperiod of two years, during which period the Authority and/or the requesting\n\nentity may require access to such records for grievance redressal, dispute\n\nredressal and audit in accordance with the procedure specified in the\n\nregulations. The authentication logs shall not be used for any purpose other\n\nthan that stated. Upon the expiry of the period of two years, the authentication\n\nlogs shall be archived for a period of five years. Upon the expiry of five years\n\nor the number of years required by the laws or regulations governing the\n\nentity whichever is later, the authentication logs shall be deleted except those\n\nlogs which are required to be retained by a court or for pending disputes.\n\nSection 2(d)428 of the Aadhaar Act allows storage of the record of the time of\n\nauthentication. These provisions permit the storage of logs of authentication\n\ntransactions for a specific time period.\n\nThe power-point presentation made by the CEO of UIDAI states that:\n\n428Section 2(d) states: “authentication record” means the record of the time of authentication and identity of the\nrequesting entity and the response provided by the Authority\nPART H\n\n“With registered devices every biometric device will have a\nunique identifier allowing traceability, analytics and fraud\nmanagement and biometric data will be signed within the\ndevice.”\n\nThe response further indicates that UIDAI gets the AUA code, ASA code,\n\nunique device code, registered device code used for authentication, and that\n\nUIDAI would know from which device the authentication has happened and\n\nthrough which AUA/ASA. The response provided by the respondents states:\n\n“UIDAI does not get any information related to the IP address\nor the GPS location from where authentication is performed\nas these parameters are not the part of authentication (v2.0)\nand e-KYC (v2.1) API. UIDAI would only know from which\ndevice the authentication has happened, through which\nAUA/ASA etc. This is what the slides meant by traceability.\nUIDAI does not receive any information about at what location\nthe authentication device is deployed, its IP address and its\noperator and the purpose of authentication. Further, the\nUIDAI or any entity under its control is statutorily barred from\ncollecting, keeping or maintaining any information about the\npurpose of authentication under Section 32(3) of the Aadhaar\nAct.”\n\nHowever,\nRegulation 26\n, which deals with the storage and maintenance of\n\nAuthentication Transaction Data clearly provides that UIDAI shall store and\n\nmaintain authentication transaction data, which shall contain the following\n\ninformation:\n\n(a) authentication request data received including PID block;\n\n(b) authentication response data sent;\n\n(c) meta data429 related to the transaction; and\n\n(d) any authentication server side configurations430 as necessary.\n\n429AUA code, ASA code, unique device code, registered device code used for authentication, and that UIDAI\nwould know from which device the authentication has happened\n430An important configuration could be IP address\nPART H\n\nThe only data, which has been excluded from retention under this provision,\n\nlike Section 32(3) of the Aadhaar Act, is the purpose of authentication.\n\nRegulation 27\nprovides that the authentication transaction data shall be\n\nretained by UIDAI for a period of six months, and will thereafter be archived\n\nfor five years, upon which, the authentication transaction data shall be deleted\n\nexcept when it is required to be maintained by a court or in connection with\n\nany pending dispute. These provisions indicate that under the Aadhaar\n\narchitecture, UIDAI stores authentication transaction data. This is in violation\n\nof the widely recognized data minimisation principles which seek that data\n\ncollectors and processors delete personal data records when the purpose for\n\nwhich it has been collected is fulfilled. The lack of specification of security\n\nstandards and the overall lack of transparency and inadequate grievance\n\nredressal mechanism under the Aadhaar program greatly exacerbate the\n\noverall risk associated with data retention. In the Aadhaar regime, an\n\nAuthentication User Agency (AUA) connects to the CIDR and uses Aadhaar\n\nauthentication to validate a user and enable its services. The responsibility for\n\nthe logistics of service delivery rests with the AUAs. In this federated model,\n\nAuthentication Service Agencies (ASAs) transmit authentication requests to\n\nCIDR on behalf of one or more AUAs. However, any device that\n\ncommunicates via the Internet is assigned an IP address. Using the meta-\n\ndata related to the transaction, the location of the authentication can easily be\n\ntraced using the IP address.\nPART H\n\n228 The petitioners have also brought the attention of this Court to bear on\n\nan expert report, with respect to security and Aadhaar, which was filed along\n\nwith an Additional Affidavit dated 09 March 2018. The report dated 4 March\n\n2018 is titled as “Analysis of Major Concern about Aadhaar Privacy and\n\nSecurity” and has been authored by Professor Manindra Agrawal. Professor\n\nAgrawal is the N Ramarao Professor at IIT Kanpur and is a member of the\n\nTechnology and Architecture Review Board (TARB) and of the Security\n\nReview Committee of UIDAI. Professor Agarwal’s Report deals with the notion\n\nof differential privacy. Differential privacy makes it possible for tech entities to\n\ncollect and share aggregate information about user habits, while maintaining\n\nthe privacy of individual users. The Report states that differential privacy of a\n\nprotocol is the change in the privacy of people when the protocol is introduced\n\nwithout altering any other protocol present. If the differential privacy of a\n\nprotocol is “non-negative”, the protocol does not compromise privacy in any\n\nway. There are four existing Aadhaar databases:\n\n(i) The ‘person database’ stores personal attributes of a person (name,\n\naddress, age, etc.) along with his/her Aadhaar number;\n\n(ii) The reference database stores the Aadhaar number of a person along\n\nwith a unique reference number (which has no relationship with the\n\nAadhaar number of an individual);\n\n(iii) The biometric database stores biometric information of a person along\n\nwith the unique reference number; and\nPART H\n\n(iv) The verification log records all ID verifications done in the past five years.\n\nFor each verification, it stores the biometric data, Aadhaar number, and\n\nID of the device on which verification was done.\n\nThe report analyses the situation if any of the databases gets leaked. The\n\nreport remarks:\n\n“Finally, let us turn attention to Verification Log. Its leakage\nmay affect both the security and the privacy of an individual\nas one can extract identities of several people (and hence\ncan keep changing forged identities) and also locate the\nplaces of transactions done by an individual in the past five\nyears. Note that differential privacy of this becomes negative\nsince without access to this database it is not possible to\ntrack locations of an individual in past five years (as opposed\nto tracking current location which is possible). Therefore,\nVerification Log must be kept secure.”\n\nThe Report underlines the importance of ensuring the security of verification\n\nlogs in the Aadhaar database. The leakage of verification logs is capable of\n\ndamaging the security and privacy of individuals since the report notes that\n\nfrom the verification log, it is possible to locate the places of transactions by\n\nan individual in the past five years. A breach in verification log would allow a\n\nthird party to access the location of the transactions of an individual over the\n\npast five years. The report indicates that it is possible through the Aadhaar\n\ndatabase to track the location of an individual. The Aadhaar database is\n\ndifferent from other databases such as PAN Card or driving license. The\n\nAadhaar database is universal and contains the biometrics of an individual.\n\nThe threshold to scrutinize the effects of this database is therefore much\n\nhigher as compared to that of other databases.\nPART H\n\n229 In Puttaswamy, Justice Kaul (in his concurring judgment) emphasized\n\nupon the concerns regarding surveillance of individuals. The learned Judge\n\nheld:\n\n“The growth and development of technology has created new\ninstruments for the possible invasion of privacy by the State,\nincluding through surveillance, profiling and data collection\nand processing. Surveillance is not new, but technology has\npermitted surveillance in ways that are unimaginable… One\nsuch technique being adopted by States is ‘profiling’. The\nEuropean Union Regulation of 2016 on data privacy defines\n‘Profiling’ as any form of automated processing of personal\ndata consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain\npersonal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to\nanalyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's\nperformance at work, economic situation, health, personal\npreferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or\nmovements. Such profiling can result in discrimination based\non religion, ethnicity and caste.”431\n\nJustice Kaul also dealt with the need to regulate the conduct of private entities\n\nvis-a-vis profiling of individuals:\n\n“The capacity of non-State actors to invade the home and\nprivacy has also been enhanced. Technological development\nhas facilitated journalism that is more intrusive than ever\nbefore…432\n…[I]n this digital age, individuals are constantly generating\nvaluable data which can be used by non-State actors to track\ntheir moves, choices and preferences. Data is generated not\njust by active sharing of information, but also passively…\nThese digital footprints and extensive data can be analyzed\ncomputationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations,\nespecially relating to human behavior and interactions and\nhence, is valuable information. This is the age of ‘big data’.\nThe advancement in technology has created not just new\nforms of data, but also new methods of analysing the data\nand has led to the discovery of new uses for data. The\nalgorithms are more effective and the computational power\nhas magnified exponentially.”433\n\n431 Puttaswamy at para 585\n432 Puttaswamy at para 587\n433 Puttaswamy at para 588\nPART H\n\n230 Section 2(c) of the Aadhaar Act is capable of revealing the identity of an\n\nindividual to UIDAI.\nSection 2(d)\npermits storage of record of the time of\n\nauthentication. Through meta data and in the light of the observations made in\n\nthe Professor Manindra Agarwal Report, it can easily be concluded that it is\n\npossible through the UIDAI database to track the location of an individual.\n\nFurther, the verification logs reveal the details of transactions over the past\n\nfive years. The verification logs are capable of profiling an individual. Details\n\nof the transaction include what the transaction was (whether authentication\n\nrequest was accepted/rejected), where it was sent from, and how it was sent.\n\nThe only thing not stored in the transaction is its purpose.\n\n231 The threat to privacy arises not from the positive identification that\n\nbiometrics provide, but the ability of third parties to access this in an\n\nidentifiable form and link it to other information, resulting in secondary use of\n\nthat information without the consent of the data subject. This erodes the\n\npersonal control of an individual over the uses of his or her information. The\n\nunauthorised secondary use of biometric data is perhaps the greatest risk that\n\nbiometric technology poses to informational privacy.434 The Manindra Agarwal\n\nReport acknowledges that the biometric database in the CIDR is accessible\n\nby third-party vendors providing biometric search and de-duplication\n\nalgorithms. The other three databases are stored, in encrypted form, by\n\nUIDAI.\n\n434Nancy Yue Liu, Bio-Privacy: Privacy Regulations and the Challenge of Biometrics, Routledge (2013) at page\nPART H\n\nIn this regard, it would be necessary to deal with the Contract (dated 24\n\nAugust 2010) signed between UIDAI and L1 Identity Solutions (the foreign\n\nentity which provided the source code for biometric storage). It has been\n\nsubmitted by the petitioners that the contract gives L1 Identity Solutions free\n\naccess to all personal information about all residents in India. The contract\n\nspecifies that UIDAI (‘the purchaser’) has the right in perpetuity to use all\n\noriginal newly created processes “identified” by M/S L-1 Identity Solutions\n\n“solely during execution” of the contract to the purchaser’s unique\n\nspecifications and which do not contain any pre-existing intellectual property\n\nright belonging to L-1 Identity Solutions.435 UIDAI was provided the license of\n\nthe software (proprietary algorithms) developed by L-1 Identity Solutions.\n\nHowever, it has been clarified in the Contract that:\n\n“The Contract and the licenses granted herein are not a sale\nof a copy of the software and do not render Purchaser the\nowner of M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company’s\nproprietary ABIS and SDK software.”436\n\nThe Contract authorises L-1 Identity Solutions to retain proprietary ownership\n\nof all intellectual property rights in and to goods, services and other\n\ndeliverables to the purchaser under the Contract that are modifications or\n\nderivative works to their pre-existing technologies, software, goods, services\n\nand other works. If a modification or derivative work made by L-1 Identity\n\nSolutions or its consortium members contains unique confidential information\n\nof the purchaser, then, the contract provides that the former shall not further\n\n435 Clause 13.1 of the Contract\n436 Ibid\nPART H\n\nlicense or distribute such modification or derivative to any other customer or\n\nthird party other than the purchaser without the purchaser’s prior written\n\npermission.437 Clause 13.3 provides:\n\n“M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company/ The team of\nM/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company shall ensure\nthat while it uses any software, hardware, processes,\ndocument or material in the course of performing the\nServices, it does not infringe the Intellectual Property Rights\nof any person and M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating\nCompany shall keep the Purchaser indemnified against all\ncosts, expenses and liabilities howsoever, arising out any\nillegal or unauthorized use (piracy) or in connections with any\nclaim or proceedings relating to any breach or violation of any\npermission/license terms or infringement of any Intellectual\nProperty Rights by M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating\nCompany or the team of M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating\nCompany during the course of performance of the Services.\nIn case of infringement by M/S L-1 Identity Solutions\nOperating Company/ The team of M/S L-1 Identity Solutions\nOperating Company, M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating\nCompany shall have sole control of the defense and all\nrelated settlement negotiations.”\n\nClause 13.4 deals with information privacy. It provides:\n\n“M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company/ The team of\nM/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company shall not carry\nany written/printed document, layout diagrams, floppy\ndiskettes, hard disk, storage tapes, other storage devices or\nany other goods/material proprietary to Purchaser into/out of\nDatacenter Sites and UIDAI Locations without written\npermission from the Purchaser.”\n\nClause 15, titled as “data and hardware”, provides:\n\n“15.1 By virtue of this Contract, M/s L-1 Identity Solutions\nOperating Company/The team of M/s L-1 Identity Solutions\nOperating Company may have access to personal information\nof the Purchaser [UIDAI] and/or a third party or any resident\nof India, any other person covered within the ambit of any\nlegislation as may be applicable. The purchaser shall have\nthe sole ownership of and the right to use all such data in\n\n437 Ibid\nPART H\n\nperpetuity including any data or other information pertaining\nto the residents of India that may be in the possession of M/s\nL-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company or the Tram of M/s\nL-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company in the course of\nperforming.\n\n15.2 The purchaser shall have the sole ownership of and the\nright to use, proprietary Biometric templates of residents of\nIndia as created and maintained by M/S L-1 Identity Solutions\nOperating Company in the course of performing the Services\nunder this Contract. In the event of termination or expiry of\ncontract, M/S L-1 Identity Solutions Operating Company shall\ntransfer all the proprietary templates to UIDAI in an electronic\nstorage media in a form that is freely retrievable for reference\nand usage in future.\n\n15.3 The Data shall be retained by M/S L-1 Identity Solutions\nOperating Company not more than a period of 7 years as per\nRetention Policy of Government of India or any other policy\nthat UIDAI may adopt in future.”\n\nUnder the Contract, L-1 Identity Solutions retains the ownership of the\n\nbiometric software. UIDAI has been given only the license to use the software.\n\nNeither the Central Government nor the UIDAI have the source code for the\n\nde-duplication technology which is at the heart of the programme. The source\n\ncode belongs to a foreign corporation. UIDAI is merely a licensee. It has also\n\nbeen provided that L-1 Identity Solutions can be given access to the database\n\nof UIDAI and the personal information of any individual.\n\n232 This Court in Puttaswamy had emphasized on the centrality of consent\n\nin protection of data privacy:\n\n“307…Apart from safeguarding privacy, data protection\nregimes seek to protect the autonomy of the individual. This is\nevident from the emphasis in the European data protection\nregime on the centrality of consent. Related to the issue of\nconsent is the requirement of transparency which requires a\ndisclosure by the data recipient of information pertaining to\ndata transfer and use.”\nPART H\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, an individual had no right of\n\ninformed consent. Without the consent of individual citizens, UIDAI contracted\n\nwith L-1 Identity Solutions to provide any information to it for the performance\n\nof the Contract. It has been provided in the Contract that L-1 Identity Solutions\n\nwould indemnify UIDAI against any loss caused to it. However, the leakage of\n\nsensitive personal information of 1.2 billion citizens, cannot be remedied by a\n\nmere contractual indemnity. The loss of data is irretrievable. In a digital\n\nsociety, an individual has the right to protect herself by maintaining control\n\nover personal information. The protection of data of 1.2 billion citizens is a\n\nquestion of national security and cannot be indemnified by a Contract.\n\n233 Mr Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the petitioners, has also\n\ndrawn the attention of this Court to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)\n\nsigned between UIDAI and various entities for carrying out the process of\n\nenrolment. Before the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, UIDAI existed as an\n\nexecutive authority, under the erstwhile Planning Commission and then under\n\nthe Union Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. Mr. Divan\n\nhas argued that the activities of the private parties engaged in the process of\n\nenrolment had no statutory or legal backing. It was his contention that MOUs\n\nsigned between UIDAI and Registrars are not contracts within the purview of\n\nArticle 299\nof the Constitution, and therefore, do not cover the acts done by\nPART H\n\nthe private entities engaged by the Registrars for enrolment.\nIn\nMonnet Ispat\n\nand Energy Ltd v Union of India438\n, this Court had held:\n\n“290. What the appellants are seeking is in a way some kind\nof a specific performance when there is no concluded\ncontract between the parties. An MOU is not a contract, and\nnot in any case within the meaning of\nArticle 299\nof the\nConstitution of India.”439\n\nThe MoUs entered into by UIDAI do not fall within the meaning of\nArticle 299\n\nof the Constitution. There is no privity of contract between UIDAI and the\n\nEnrolling agencies.\n\n234 This Court held in Puttaswamy that any law which infringes the right to\n\nprivacy of an individual needs to have stringent inbuilt safeguards against the\n\nabuse of the process. The Aadhaar Act envisages UIDAI as the sole authority\n\nfor the purpose of the Act. It entrusts UIDAI with a wide canvass of functions,\n\nboth administrative and adjudicatory. It performs the functions of appointing\n\nenrolling agencies, registrars and requesting entities. Currently, there are 212\n\nRegistrars and 755 enrolling agencies in different states of the country. 440\n\nMonitoring the actions of so many entities is not a task easily done.\n\nResponsibility has also been placed on UIDAI to manage and secure the\n\ncentral database of identity information of individuals. UIDAI is also required\n\nto ensure that data stored in CIDR is kept secure and confidential. It has been\n\nplaced with the responsibility for the protection of the identity information of\n\n1.2 billion citizens. UIDAI is entrusted with discretionary powers under the\n438 (2012) 11 SCC 1\n439 Ibid, at page 153\n440 As submitted by Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel for the State of Gujarat\nPART H\n\narchitecture of Aadhaar, including the discretion to share the personal\n\ninformation of any individual with the biometric service providers (BSPs) for\n\nthe performance of contracts with them.\n\n235 The proviso to\nSection 28(5)\nprovides only for a request to UIDAI for\n\naccess to information and does not make access to information a right of the\n\nindividual. This would mean that it would be entirely upon the discretion of the\n\nUIDAI to refuse to grant access to the information once a request has been\n\nmade. It is also not clear how a person is supposed to know that the biometric\n\ninformation contained in the database has changed if he/she does not have\n\naccess to it. UIDAI is also empowered to investigate any breach under the\n\nAct, as a result of which any offence under the Act will be cognizable only if a\n\ncomplaint is filed by UIDAI. UIDAI is not an independent monitoring agency.\n\nUnder the Aadhaar architecture, UIDAI is the only authority which carries out\n\nall the functions, be it administrative, adjudicatory, investigative, or monitoring\n\nof the project.\nWhile the Act\nconfers such major functions on UIDAI, it does\n\nnot place any institutional accountability upon UIDAI to protect the database\n\nof citizens’ personal information.\nThe Act\nis silent on the liability of UIDAI and\n\nits personnel in case of non-compliance of the provisions of the Act or the\n\nregulations made under it. Under\nSection 23(2)(s)\nof the Act, UIDAI is\n\nrequired to establish a grievance redressal mechanism. Making the authority\n\nadministering a project, also responsible for providing for the framework to\nPART H\n\naddress grievances arising from the project, severely compromises the\n\nindependence of the grievance redressal body.441\nSection 47\nof the Act\n\nviolates the right to seek remedy. Under\nSection 47(1)\n, a court can take\n\ncognizance of an offence punishable under the Act only on a complaint made\n\nby UIDAI or any officer or person authorised by it. There is no grievance\n\nredressal mechanism if any breach or offence is committed by UIDAI itself.\n\nThe law must specify who is to be held accountable.\nThe Act\nlacks a\n\nmechanism through which any individual can seek speedy redressal for\n\nhis/her data leakage and identity theft. Compensation must be provided for\n\nany loss of data of an individual. A stringent and independent redressal\n\nmechanism and options for compensation must be incorporated in the law.\n\nSection 47\nis arbitrary as it fails to provide a mechanism to individuals to seek\n\nefficacious remedies for violation of their right to privacy. Whether it is against\n\nUIDAI or a private entity, it is critical that the individual retains the right to seek\n\ncompensation and justice. This would require a carefully designed\n\nstructure.442\n\n236 An independent and autonomous authority is needed to monitor the\n\ncompliance of the provisions of any statute, which infringes the privacy of an\n\nindividual. A fair data protection regime requires establishment of an\n\nindependent authority to deal with the contraventions of the data protection\n\nframework as well as to proactively supervise its compliance.

It\n\nhas to independently adjudicate upon disputes in relation to the contravention\n\nof the law. Data protection requires a strong regulatory framework to protect\n\nthe basic rights of individuals. The architecture of Aadhaar ought to have, but\n\nhas failed to embody within the law the establishment of an independent\n\nmonitoring authority (with a hierarchy of regulators), along with the broad\n\nprinciples for data protection.443 The principles should include that the means\n\nof collection of data are fair and lawful, the purpose and relevance is clearly\n\ndefined, user limitations accompanied by intelligible consent requirements are\n\nspecified and subject to safeguards against risks such as loss, unauthorised\n\naccess, modification and disclosure.444 The independent authority needs to be\n\nanswerable to Parliament. In the absence of a regulatory framework which\n\nprovides robust safeguards for data protection, the Aadhaar Act does not\n\npass muster against a challenge on the ground of\nArticle 14.\nThe law fails to\n\nmeet the norms expected of a data protection regime which safeguards the\n\ndata of 1.2 billion Indians. The absence of a regulatory framework leaves the\n\nlaw vulnerable to challenge on the ground that it has failed to meet the\n\nrequirements of fair institutional governance under the rule of law.\n\n237 The scheme of the Aadhaar Act is postulated on the norms enunciated\n\nin Chapter VI for the protection of information and their enforcement under a\n443Subhashis Banerjee, Architecture for privacy, The Indian Express (5 May 2018), available at\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/architecture-for-privacy-data-protection-facebook-india-\nunited-states-5163819/\n444 Shankkar Aiyar, Aadhaar: A Biometric History of India’s 12-Digit Revolution, Westland (2017), at page 226\nPART H\n\nregime of criminal offences and penalties under Chapter VII. Providing a\n\nregime under law for penalizing criminal wrongdoing is necessary. But,\n\ncriminal offences are not a panacea for a robust regulatory framework under\n\nthe auspices of an autonomous regulatory body. Violations in regard to the\n\nintegrity of data may be incremental. Millions of data transactions take place in\n\nthe daily lives of a community of individuals. Violations in regard to the\n\nintegrity of data are numerous. Some of them may appear to be trivial, if\n\nlooked at in isolation. However, cumulatively, these violations seriously\n\nencroach on the dignity and autonomy of the individual. A regime of criminal\n\nlaw may not in itself be adequate to deal with all these violations in terms of\n\ntheir volume and complexity. It is hence necessary that the criminal law must\n\nbe supplemented by an independent regulatory framework. In its absence,\n\nthere is a grave danger that the regime of data protection, as well as the\n\nadministration of criminal justice will be rendered dysfunctional. Unfortunately,\n\na regulatory framework of the nature\nreferred to above\nis completely absent.\n\nUIDAI which is established and controlled by the Union Government\n\npossesses neither the autonomy nor the regulatory authority to enforce the\n\nmandate of the law in regard to the protection of data. The absence of a\n\nregulatory framework renders the legislation largely ineffective in dealing with\n\ndata violations. Data protection cannot be left to an unregulated market place.\n\nNor can the law rest in the fond hope that organized structures within or\n\noutside government will be self-compliant. The Aadhaar Act has manifestly\n\nfailed in its legislative design to establish and enforce an autonomous\nPART H\n\nregulatory mechanism. Absent such a mechanism, the state has failed to fulfil\n\nthe obligation cast upon it to protect the individual right to informational self-\n\ndetermination.\nSection 33(2)\n, which permits disclosure of identity information and\n\nauthentication records in the interest of national security, specifies a\n\nprocedure for oversight by a committee. However, no substantive provisions\n\nhave been laid down as guiding principles for the oversight mechanism such\n\nas the principle of data minimisation.\n\n239 Privacy concerns relating to the Aadhaar project have been the subject\n\nof wide ranging deliberation. Biometric data offers strong evidence of one’s\n\nidentity since it represents relatively unique biological characteristics which\n\ndistinguish one person from another. As biometric data can be usually linked\n\nto only one individual it acts as a powerful, unique identifier that brings\n\ntogether disparate pieces of personal information about an individual. As a\n\nrelatively unique identifier, biometric data not only allows individuals to be\n\ntracked, but it also creates the potential for the collection of an individual’s\n\ninformation and its incorporation into a comprehensive profile. Central\n\ndatabases, data matching/linking and profiling are technical factors that\n\nfacilitate ‘function creep’ (the slippery slope according to which information\n\ncan be used for functions other than that for which it was collected). Privacy\n\nadvocates believe that any identification scheme can be carried out with a\nPART H\n\nhidden agenda and that the slippery slope effect can be relevant to several\n\nfactors such as motivations of governments and business, and on the\n\nexistence of safeguards. The special nature of biometric data makes function\n\ncreep more likely and even attractive. The legal measures possible to control\n\nfunction creep are still limited. However, there are several ways in which\n\nfunction creep can be curtailed. They include (i) limiting the amount of data\n\nthat is collected for any stated purpose; (ii) enabling regulation to limit\n\ntechnological access to the system; (iii) concerted debates with all\n\nstakeholders and public participation; (iv) dispersion of multiple enablers for a\n\nsystem; and (v) enabling choices for user participation.\n\n240 This Court held in Puttaswamy that a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy requires that data collection must not violate the autonomy of an\n\nindividual. The Court has held consent, transparency, and control over\n\ninformation as the cornerstones over which the fundamentals of informational\n\nprivacy stand. The Court had made it clear that an individual has the right to\n\nprevent others from using his or her image, name and other aspects of\n\npersonal life and identity for commercial purposes without consent. An\n\nAadhaar number is a unique attribute of an individual. It embodies unique\n\ninformation associated with an individual. The manner in which it is to be used\n\nhas to be dependent on the consent of the individual.\nPART H\n\n241 Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act allows the use of an Aadhaar number for\n\nestablishing the identity of an individual “for any purpose” by the state, private\n\nentities and persons. Allowing private entities to use Aadhaar numbers will\n\nlead to commercial exploitation of an individual’s personal data without his/her\n\nconsent and could lead to individual profiling. The contention is that\nSection\nfails to meet the requirements set out in the Puttaswamy judgment.\n\nIn this regard, reference must be drawn to a 2010 policy paper. A group of\n\nofficers was created by the Government of India to develop a framework for a\n\nprivacy legislation that would balance the need for privacy protection with\n\nsecurity and sectoral interests, and respond to the need for domain legislation\n\non the subject. An approach paper for the legal framework for a proposed\n\nlegislation on privacy was prepared by the group and was uploaded on the\n\nwebsite of the Government of India. The paper noted the repercussions of\n\nhaving a project based on a database of unique individual IDs:\n\n“Data privacy and the need to protect personal information is\nalmost never a concern when data is stored in a\ndecentralized manner. However, all this is likely to change\nwith the implementation of the UID Project. One of the\ninevitable consequences of the UID Project will be that the\nUID Number will unify multiple databases. As more and more\nagencies of the government sign on to the UID Project, the\nUID Number will become the common thread that links all\nthose databases together. Over time, private enterprise could\nalso adopt the UID Number as an identifier for the purposes\nof the delivery of their services or even for enrolment as a\ncustomer...Once this happens, the separation of data that\ncurrently exists between multiple databases will vanish…\n\nSuch a vast interlinked public information database is\nunprecedented in India. It is imperative that appropriate steps\nbe taken to protect personal data before the vast government\nPART H\n\nstorehouses of private data are linked up and the threat of\ndata security breach becomes real.”445\n\nThe Paper highlighted the potential of exploitation that the UID project\n\npossessed. The potential was that the UID data could be used directly or\n\nindirectly by market forces for commercial exploitation as well as for intrusions\n\nby the State into citizens’ privacy. The Paper contained an incisive\n\nobservation in regard to the exploitation of citizens’ data by private entities:\n\n“Similarly, the private sector entities such as banks, telecom\ncompanies, hospitals etc are collecting vast amount of private\nor personal information about individuals. There is\ntremendous scope for both commercial exploitation of this\ninformation without the consent/ knowledge of the individual\nconsent and also for embarrassing an individual whose\npersonal particulars can be made public by any of these\nprivate entities.\nThe IT Act\ndoes provide some safeguards\nagainst disclosure of data / information stored electronically,\nbut there is no legislation for protecting the privacy of\nindividuals for all information that may be available with\nprivate entities\nIn view of the above, privacy of individual is to be protected\nboth with reference to the actions of Government as well as\nprivate sector entities.”446\n\nThe Paper highlighted the need for a stringent privacy protection mechanism,\n\nwhich could prevent individual data from commercial exploitation as well as\n\nindividual profiling.\n\n242 Reference must also be drawn to Chapter V of the National\n\nIdentification Authority of India Bill, 2010, which provided for the constitution of\n\n445Government of India, Approach Paper for a Legislation on Privacy (2010), available at\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/aproach_paper.pdf\n446 Ibid\nPART H\n\nan Identity Review Committee. The proposed Committee was to be entrusted\n\nto carry out the function of ascertaining the extent and pattern of usage of\n\nAadhaar numbers across the country. The Committee was required to prepare\n\na report annually in relation to the extent and pattern of usage of the Aadhaar\n\nnumbers along with its recommendations thereon and submit it to the Central\n\nGovernment. The idea behind the establishment of such a Committee was to\n\nlimit the extent to which Aadhaar numbers could be used. These provisions\n\nhave not been included in the\nAadhaar Act, 2016\n. Instead, the Act allows the\n\nuse of Aadhaar number for any purpose by the State as well as private\n\nentities. This is a clear case of overbreadth and an instance of manifest\n\narbitrariness.\nSection 57\nindicates that the legislature has travelled far beyond its\n\nstated object of ensuring targeted delivery of social welfare benefits. Allowing\n\nthe Aadhaar platform for use by private entities overreaches the purpose of\n\nenacting the law. It leaves bare the commercial exploitation of citizens data\n\neven in purported exercise of contractual clauses. This will result in a violation\n\nof privacy and profiling of citizens.\nPART H\n\nAn article titled “Privacy and Security of Aadhaar: A Computer Science\n\nPerspective”447 underlines the risk of profiling and identification that is\n\npossible by the use of Aadhaar numbers. It states:\n\n“The Aadhaar number is at the heart of the Aadhaar scheme\nand is one of the biggest causes of concern. Recall that the\nAadhaar number is a single unique identifier that must\nfunction across multiple domains. Given that the Aadhaar\nnumber must necessarily be disclosed for obtaining services,\nit becomes publicly available, not only electronically but also\noften in human readable forms as well, thereby increasing the\nrisk that service providers and other interested parties may be\nable to profile users across multiple service domains. Once\nthe Aadhaar number of an individual is (inevitably) known,\nthat individual may be identified without consent across\ndomains, leading to multiple breaches in privacy.”\n\n244 The risks which the use of Aadhaar “for any purpose” carries is that\n\nwhen it is linked with different databases (managed by the State or by private\n\nentities), the Aadhaar number becomes the central unifying feature that\n\nconnects the cell phone with geo-location data, one’s presence and\n\nmovement with a bank account and income tax returns, food and lifestyle\n\nconsumption with medical records. This starts a “causal link” between\n\ninformation which was usually unconnected and was considered trivial. 448\n\nThus, linking Aadhaar with different databases carries the potential of being\n\nprofiled into a system, which could be used for commercial purposes. It also\n\ncarries the capability of influencing the behavioural patterns of individuals, by\n\naffecting their privacy and liberty. Profiling individuals could be used to create\n\nco-relations between human lives, which are generally unconnected. If the\n\n447 Shweta Agrawal, Subhashis Banerjee, and Subodh Sharma, Privacy and Security of Aadhaar: A Computer\nScience Perspective, Economic & Political Weekly (16 September 2017), Vol. 52, available at\nhttps://www.epw.in/journal/2017/37/special-articles/privacy-and-security-aadhaar.html\n448 Nishant Shah, Digital Native: Cause an effect, The Indian Express (17 June 2018), available at\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/digital-native-cause-an-effect-5219977/\nPART H\n\ntraces of Aadhaar number are left in every facet of human life, it will lead to a\n\nloss of privacy. The repercussions of profiling individuals were anticipated in\n\n1966 by Alexander Solzhenitsyn in ‘Cancer Ward’449. His views are prescient\n\nto our age:\n\n“As every man goes through life he fills in a number of forms\nfor the record, each containing a number of questions. A\nman’s answer to one question on one form becomes a little\nthread, permanently connecting him to the local centre of\npersonnel records administration. There are thus hundreds of\nlittle threads radiating from every man, millions of threads in\nall. If these threads were suddenly to become visible, the\nwhole sky would look like a spider’s web, and if they\nmaterialised as elastic bands, buses, trams and even people\nwould all lose the ability to move, and the wind would be\nunable to carry torn newspapers or autumn leaves along the\nstreets of the city. They are not visible, they are not material,\nbut every man is constantly aware of their existence… Each\nman, permanently aware of his own invisible threads,\nnaturally develops a respect for the people who manipulate\nthe threads…”\n\nThe invisible threads of a society networked on biometric data have grave\n\nportents for the future. Unless the law mandates an effective data protection\n\nframework, the quest for liberty and dignity would be as ephemeral as the\n\nwind.\n\n245 A novelist’s vision is threatening to become a reality in our times.\n\nProfiling can impact individuals and their behaviour. Since data collection\n\nrecords the preferences of an individual based on the entities which requested\n\nfor proof of identity, any such pattern in itself is crucial data that could be used\n\nto predict the emergence of future choices and preferences of individuals.\n\n449 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Cancer Ward, The Bodley Head (1968)\nPART H\n\nThese preferences could also be used to influence the decision making of the\n\nelectorate in choosing candidates for electoral offices. Such a practice would\n\nbe unhealthy for the working of a democracy, where a citizen is deprived of\n\nfree choice. In the modern digital era, privacy protection does not demand that\n\ndata should not be collected, stored, or used, but that there should be\n\nprovable guarantees that the data cannot be used for any purpose other than\n\nthose that have been approved. In any of the programmes employed, it is\n\nimperative that the state takes strong data privacy measures to prevent theft\n\nand abuse. Moreover, it must be realized that an identification system like\n\nAadhaar, which is implemented nationwide, will always be more prone to\n\nexternal threats. The State is always open to threat from its adversaries, and\n\na national level identification system can become an easy target for anyone\n\nlooking to cause serious damage as individuals’ biometric credentials are at\n\nrisk in the process. Therefore, it is vital that state action ascertain security\n\nvulnerabilities while developing an identification system. These issues have\n\nnot been dealt with by the Aadhaar Act. There is currently limited legislative or\n\nother regulatory guidance to specify whether private or public organisations\n\nare prevented from sharing or selling biometric information to others.\nSection\ncannot be applied to permit commercial exploitation of the data of\n\nindividuals or to affect their behavioural patterns.\nSection 57\ndoes not pass\n\nconstitutional muster. It is manifestly arbitrary, suffers from overbreadth and\n\nviolates\nArticle 14.\nPART H\n\n246 At its core, the Aadhaar Act attempts to create a method for\n\nidentification of individuals so as to provide services, subsidies and other\n\nbenefits to them. The Preamble of the Act explains that the architecture of the\n\nAct seeks to provide “efficient, transparent and targeted delivery of subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services” for which the expenditure is incurred from the\n\nConsolidated Fund to resident individuals.\nSection 7\nof the Act makes the\n\nproof of possession of Aadhaar number or Aadhaar authentication as a\n\nmandatory condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service, which incurs\n\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India. The scope of\nSection 7\nis\n\nvery wide. It leaves the door open for the government to route more benefits,\n\nsubsidies and services through the Consolidated Fund of India and expand\n\nthe scope of Aadhaar. Any activity of the government paid for from the\n\nConsolidated Fund of India ranging from supply of subsidised grains and\n\nLPG, to use of roads and civic amenities, healthcare, and even rebates to tax\n\npayers could come under such an umbrella. The scope of\nSection 7\ncould\n\ncover every basic aspect of the lives of citizens. The marginalized sections of\n\nsociety, who largely depend upon government’s social security schemes and\n\nother welfare programmes for survival could be denied basic living conditions\n\nbecause of a mismatch in biometric algorithms. The notifications issued by\n\ngovernment under\nSection 7\nof the Act, which require mandatory proof of\n\npossession of an Aadhaar number or requiring authentication, cover 252\n\nschemes, including schemes for children (such as benefits under the Sarva\n\nShiksha Abhiyan or getting meals under the Mid-day meal scheme, painting\nPART H\n\nand essay competitions for children, scholarships on merit), schemes relating\n\nto rehabilitation of bonded labour and human trafficking, scholarship schemes\n\nfor SC/ST students, universal access to tuberculosis care, pensions, schemes\n\nrelating to labour and employment, skill development, personnel and training,\n\nagriculture and farmers’ welfare, primary and higher education, social justice,\n\nbenefits for persons with disabilities, women and child development, rural\n\ndevelopment, food distribution, healthcare, panchayati raj, chemicals &\n\nfertilizers, water resources, petroleum and natural gas, science and\n\ntechnology, sanitation, textiles, urban development, minority affairs, road\n\ntransport, culture, tourism, urban housing, tribal affairs and stipends for\n\ninternship for students. The list is ever expanding and is endless. These\n\nnotifications cover a large number of facilities provided by the government to\n\nits citizens. Every conceivable facility can be brought under the rubric of\n\nSection 7\n. From delivery to deliverance, almost every aspect of the cycle of\n\nlife would be governed by the logic of Aadhaar.\n\n247 When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, it becomes a bridge\n\nacross discreet data silos, which allows anyone with access to this information\n\nto re-construct a profile of an individual’s life. It must be noted while Section\n\n2(k) of the Aadhaar Act excludes storage of individual information related to\n\nrace, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, income or medical history into\n\nCIDR, the mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various schemes allows the\n\nsame result in effect. For instance, when an individual from a particular caste\nPART H\n\nengaged in manual scavenging is rescued and in order to take benefit of\n\nrehabilitation schemes, she/he has to link the Aadhaar number with the\n\nscheme, the effect is that a profile as that of a person engaged in manual\n\nscavenging is created in the scheme database. The stigma of being a manual\n\nscavenger gets permanently fixed to her/his identity. What the Aadhaar Act\n\nseeks to exclude specifically is done in effect by the mandatory linking of\n\nAadhaar numbers with different databases, under cover of the delivery of\n\nbenefits and services.\n\nMoreover, the absence of proof of an Aadhaar number would render a\n\nresident non-existent in the eyes of the State, and would deny basic facilities\n\nto such residents.\nSection 7\nthus makes a direct impact on the lives of\n\ncitizens. If the requirement of Aadhaar is made mandatory for every benefit or\n\nservice which the government provides, it is impossible to live in\n\ncontemporary India without Aadhaar. It suffers from the vice of being\n\noverbroad. The scope of subsidies provided by the government (which incur\n\nexpenditure from the Consolidated Fund) is not the same as that of other\n\nbenefits and services which the government provides to its citizens.\n\nTherefore, benefits and services cannot be measured with the same yardstick\n\nas subsidies. The inclusion of services and benefits in\nSection 7\nis a pre-\n\ncursor to the kind of function creep which is inconsistent with privacy and\n\ninformational self-determination. The broad definitions of the expressions\n\n‘services and ‘benefits’ would enable government to regulate almost every\nPART H\n\nfacet of its engagement with citizens under the Aadhaar platform.\nSection 7\n\nsuffers from clear overbreadth in its uncanalised application to services and\n\nbenefits.\n\n248 The open-ended nature of the provisions of\nSection 7\nis apparent from\n\nthe definition of ‘benefit’ in\nSection 2(f)\nand of ‘service’ in\nSection 2(w)\n.\n\n‘Benefit’ is defined to mean any advantage, gift, reward, relief or payment in\n\ncash or kind provided to an individual or a group of individuals. ‘Service’ is\n\ndefined to mean any provision, facility, utility, or any other assistance provided\n\nin any form to an individual or a group of individuals. These are broad and\n\nunstructured terms under which the government can cover the entire gamut of\n\nits activities involving an interface with the citizen. The provision has made no\n\nrequirement to determine whether in the first place biometric identification is\n\nnecessary in each case and whether a less intrusive modality should suffice.\n\nBoth the definitions include such other services as may be notified by the\n\nCentral government. The residuary clause is vague and ambiguous and\n\nleaves it to the Central government at its uncharted discretion to expand on\n\nwhat benefits and services would be covered by the legislation. The manner\n\nin which these definitions have been expansively applied to cover a wide\n\nrange of activities is attributable to the vagueness implicit in\nSection 7\n.\n\nCan the provisions of\nSection 7\nbe applied with any justification to pensions\n\npayable on account of the past service rendered by a person to the state?\nPART H\n\nPension, it is well settled, is not a largesse or bounty conferred by the state.\n\nPension, as a condition of service, attaches as a recompense for the long\n\nyears of service rendered by an individual to the state and its instrumentalities.\n\nPensioners grow older with passing age. Many of them suffer from the\n\ntribulations of old age including the loss of biometrics. It is unfair and arbitrary\n\non the part of the state to deny pension to a person entitled to it by linking\n\npensionary payments to the possession of an Aadhaar number or to its\n\nauthentication. A right cannot be denied on the anvil of requiring one and only\n\none means of identification. The pension disbursing authority is entitled to lay\n\ndown regulations (which are generally speaking, already in place) to ensure\n\nthe disbursal of pension to the person who is rightfully entitled. This aim of the\n\ngovernment can be fulfilled by other less intrusive measures. The requirement\n\nof insisting on an Aadhaar number for the payment of pensionary benefits\n\ninvolves a breach of the principle of proportionality. Such a requirement would\n\nclearly be contrary to the mandate of\nArticle 14.\n\nSimilarly, the state as a part of its welfare obligations provides numerous\n\nbenefits to school going children, including mid-day meals or scholarships, to\n\nchildren belonging to the marginalised segments of the society. Should the\n\ndisbursal of these benefits be made to depend upon a young child obtaining\n\nan Aadhaar number or undergoing the process of authentication? The object\n\nof the state is to ensure that the benefits which it offers are being availed of by\n\ngenuine students who are entitled to them. This legitimate aim can be fulfilled\nPART H\n\nby adopting less intrusive measures as opposed to the mandatory\n\nenforcement of the Aadhaar scheme as the sole repository of identification.\n\nThe state has failed to demonstrate that a less intrusive measure other than\n\nbiometric authentication will not subserve its purposes. That the state has\n\nbeen able to insist on adherence to the Aadhaar scheme without exception is\n\na result of the overbreadth of\nSection 7\n. Consequently, the inclusion of\n\nbenefits and services in\nSection 7\nsuffers from a patent ambiguity, vagueness\n\nand overbreadth which renders the inclusion of services and benefits arbitrary\n\nand violative of\nArticle 14.\n\n249 Various entities are involved in the Aadhaar project. Their inter-\n\ndependencies require a greater onus to be put on them so as to match\n\nprivacy and security requirements. The architecture of Aadhaar treats\n\nindividuals as data. However, the core must be about personhood. The\n\narchitecture of Aadhaar is destroyed by a lack of transparency, accountability\n\nand limitations. Safeguards for protection of individual rights ought to have\n\nbeen explicitly guaranteed by design and default.450 The presence of\n\naccountability and transparency within the Aadhaar architecture ought to be a\n\nnecessary requirement so as to overcome the fear of the loss of privacy and\n\nliberty. Without these safeguards, the legislation and its architecture cannot\n\npass muster under proportionality.\n\n450 Shankkar Aiyar, Aadhaar: A Biometric History of India’s 12-Digit Revolution, Westland (2017), at page 226\nPART H\n\nIt is also important to highlight that identity is a vital facet of personality and\n\nhence of the right to life under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution. Identity is\n\nessential and inalienable to human relationships and in the dealings of an\n\nindividual with the State. The notion that individuals possess only one, or at\n\nthe least, a dominant identity is not sound constitutional principle. The\n\nConstitution has been adopted for a nation of plural cultures. It is accepting of\n\ndiversity in every walk of life. Diversity of identity is an expression of the\n\nplurality which constitutes the essence of our social culture. Amartya Sen in\n\n‘The Argumentative Indian’451 demonstrates the untenability of the notion\n\nthat identity is exclusive. He rejects the notion of an exclusive identity as\n\n“preposterous”, observing that in different settings, individuals rely upon and\n\nassert varying identities:\n\n“Each of us invokes identities of various kinds in disparate\ncontexts. The same person can be of Indian origin, a Parsee,\na French citizen, a US resident, a woman, a poet, a\nvegetarian, an anthropologist, a university professor, a\nChristian, a bird watcher, and an avid believer in extra-\nterrestrial life and of the propensity of alien creatures to ride\naround the cosmos in multicoloured UFOs. Each of these\ncollectivities, to all of which this person belongs, gives him or\nher a particular identity. They can all have relevance,\ndepending on the context.”452\n\nSen’s logic, drawn from how individuals express their personalities in the real\n\nworld, has a strong constitutional foundation. In the protection which it grants\n\nto a diverse set of liberties and freedoms, the Constitution allows for the\n\nassertion of different identities. The exercise of each freedom may generate a\n\ndistinct identity. Combinations of freedoms are compatible with composite\n\n451 Amartya Sen, The Argumentative Indian, Penguin (2005), at page 350\n452 Ibid, at page 350\nPART H\n\nidentities. Sen also rejects the notion that individuals “discover their identities\n\nwith little room for choice”. The support for such a notion, as he observes,\n\ncomes from communitarian philosophy, according to which identity precedes\n\nchoice:\n\n“As Professor Michael Sandel has explained this claim\n(among other communitarian claims) : ‘community describes\nnot just what they have as fellow citizens but also what they\nare, not a relationship they choose (as in a voluntary\nassociation) but an attachment they discover, not merely an\nattribute but a constituent of their identity In this view, identity\ncomes before reasoning and choice.”453\n\nSen rejects the above idea on the ground that it does not reflect a universally\n\nvalid principle. Undoubtedly, some identities are ‘given’. But even here, as\n\nSen explains, the issue is not whether an identity can be selected by an\n\nindividual in all cases but whether the individual has a choice over the relative\n\nweight to be ascribed to different identities:\n\n“The point at issue is not whether any identity whatever can\nbe chosen (that would be an absurd claim), but whether we\nhave choices over alternative identities or combinations of\nidentities, and perhaps more importantly, whether we have\nsome freedom in deciding what priority to give to the various\nidentities that we may simultaneously have. People’s choices\nmay be constrained by the recognition that they are, say,\nJewish or Muslim, but there is still a decision to be made by\nthem regarding what importance they give to that particular\nidentity over others that they may also have (related, for\nexample, to their political beliefs, sense of nationality,\nhumanitarian commitments or professional attachments).”454\n\nSen reasons that identity is a plural concept and the relevance of different\n\nidentities depends on the contexts in which they are asserted:\n\n453 Ibid, at page 350\n454 Ibid, at page 351\nPART H\n\n“Identity is thus a quintessentially plural concept, with varying\nrelevance of different identities in distinct contexts. And, most\nimportantly, we have choice over what significance to attach\nto our different identities. There is no escape from reasoning\njust because the notion of identity has been invoked. Choices\nover identities do involve constraints and connections, but the\nchoices that exist and have to be made are real, not illusory.\nIn particular, the choice of priorities between different\nidentities, including what relative weights to attach to their\nrespective demands, cannot be only a matter of discovery.\nThey are inescapably decisional, and demand reason-not just\nrecognition.”455\n\n250 The Constitution recognizes, through the rights which it protects, a\n\nmultitude of identities and the myriad forms of its expression. Our political\n\nidentities as citizens define our relationship with the nation state. The rights\n\nwhich the Constitution recognizes as fundamental liberties constitute a\n\nreflection of the identity of the self. As we speak, so we profess who we are.\n\nAn artist who paints, the writer who shares a thought, the musician who\n\ncomposes, the preacher who influences our spirituality and the demagogue\n\nwho launches into human sensibilities are all participants in the assertion of\n\nidentity. In this participative process, the identities of both the performer and\n\nthe audience are continuously engaged. Identity at a constitutional level is\n\nreflected in the entitlement of every individual, protected by its values, to lead\n\na way of life which defines the uniqueness of our beings. The Constitution\n\nrecognizes a multitude of identities, based on the liberties which it recognizes\n\nas an inseparable part of our beings. To be human is to have a multitude of\n\nidentities and be guaranteed the right to express it in various forms. The state\n\n455 Ibid, at page 352\nPART H\n\nwhich must abide by a written Constitution cannot require any person to\n\nforsake one or more identities. Constitutional freedoms compel the state to\n\nrespect them.\n\n251 Technologies that affect how our identities function must be subject to\n\nconstitutional norms. The existence of individual identity is the core of a\n\nconstitutional democracy. Addressing the Constituent Assembly on 4th\n\nNovember 1948, Dr B.R. Ambedkar had emphasised on the importance of\n\nindividual identity in our constitutional framework:\n\n“I am glad that the Draft Constitution has… adopted the\nindividual as its unit.”456\n\nHaving an individual identity is an important part of the human condition. The\n\nnegation of identity is the loss of personhood, which in turn affects the\n\nfreedom of choice and free will. Personhood constructs democracy. It\n\nrepresents the quality of democracy. Our decided cases have recognized the\n\nintimate relationship between human liberty and identity.

Justice Kaul’s concurring\n\nopinion recognised that the individual has the right to control her identity.464\n\nIt was submitted by the petitioners that a unique identity number infringes the\n\nidentity of the individual since it reduces every resident to a number.\n\nAscribing to the holder of an Aadhaar card, a unique identity number must not\n\ninfringe constitutional identities. The Aadhaar Act indicates, in its Statement\n\nof Objects and Reasons, that correct identification of targeted beneficiaries is\n\nnecessary and that a failure to establish the identity of an individual is a major\n\nhindrance in the disbursal of welfare benefits.\nSection 3(1)\nrecognizes the\n\nentitlement of every resident to obtain an Aadhaar number.\nSection 4(3)\n\nprovides that an Aadhaar number may be accepted as proof of identity.\n\nSection 7(1)\nindicates that its purpose is for establishing the identity of an\n\nindividual for the receipt of services, benefits or subsidies drawn from the\n\nConsolidated Fund. These provisions cannot be allowed to displace\n\nconstitutional identities. Nor can the provisions of\nSection 7\nreduce an\n\nindividual to a nameless or faceless person.\n\n461 (2014) 5 SCC 438\n462 (1996) 5 SCC 125\n463 (2011) 7 SCC 547\n464 Ibid\nPART H\n\n252 Aadhaar is about identification and is an instrument which facilitates a\n\nproof of identity. It must not obliterate constitutional identity. The definition of\n\ndemographic information in\nSection 2(k)\nexcludes race, religion, caste, tribe,\n\nethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history.\n\nHowever, as has been specifically discussed before, the linking of the\n\nAadhaar number to different databases is capable of profiling an individual,\n\nwhich could include information regarding her/his race, religion, caste, tribe,\n\nethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history. Thus,\n\nthe impact of technology is such that the scheme of Aadhaar can reduce\n\ndifferent constitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and\n\ninfringe the right of an individual to identify herself/himself with choice.\n\n253 Social security schemes and programmes are a medium of existence of\n\na large segment of society. Social security schemes in India, such as the\n\nPDS, were introduced to protect the dignity of the marginalized. Exclusion\n\nfrom these schemes defeats the rationale for the schemes which is to\n\novercome chronic hunger and malnutrition. Exclusion is violative of human\n\ndignity. As discussed previously in detail, the statistics recorded in\n\ngovernment records and the affidavits filed by the petitioners point out glaring\n\nexamples of exclusion due to technical errors in Aadhaar. The authentication\n\nfailures in the Aadhaar scheme have caused severe disruptions particularly in\n\nrural India. Exclusion as a consequence of biometric devices has a\n\ndisproportionate impact on the lives of the marginalized and poor. This Court\nPART H\n\ncannot turn a blind eye to the rights of the marginalized. It may be the fashion\n\nof the day to advance the cause of a digital nation. Technology is undoubtedly\n\nan enabler. It has become a universal unifier of our age. Yet, the interface\n\nbetween technology and basic human rights cannot be oblivious to social\n\nreality. Compulsive linking of biometrics to constitutional entitlements should\n\nnot result in denial to the impoverished. There exists a digital divide. To\n\nrailroad those on one side of that divide unconcerned about social and\n\ntechnical constraints which operate in society is to defeat the purpose of social\n\nwelfare. The Court has to be specifically conscious of the dignity of the\n\nunderprivileged. The Court must fulfill its role of protecting constitutional\n\nvalues even if it affects a small percentage of the population. The exclusion\n\nerrors in this case have led to grave injustice to the marginalized. The Court,\n\ntherefore, has to play an active role in protecting their dignity.\n\n254 The institution of rights places a heavy onus on the State to justify its\n\nrestrictions. No right can be taken away on the whims and fancies of the\n\nState. The State has failed to justify its actions and to demonstrate why\n\nfacilitating the targeted delivery of subsidies, which promote several rights\n\nsuch as the right to food for citizens, automatically entails a sacrifice of the\n\nright to privacy when both these rights are protected by the Constitution. One\n\nright cannot be taken away at the behest of the other especially when the\n\nState has been unable to satisfy this Court that the two rights are mutually\n\nexclusive. The State has been unable to respond to the contention of the\nPART H\n\npetitioners that it has failed to consider that there were much less rights-\n\ninvasive measures that could have furthered its goals. The burden of proof on\n\nthe State was to demonstrate that the right to food and other entitlements\n\nprovided through the Aadhaar scheme could not have been secured without\n\nthe violating the fundamental rights of privacy and dignity. Dworkin in his\n\nclassical book “Taking Rights Seriously”, while answering the question\n\nwhether some rights are so important that the State is justified in doing all it\n\ncan to maintain even if it abridges other rights, states that:\n\n“But no society that purports to recognize a variety of rights,\non the ground that a man’s dignity or equality may be invaded\nin a variety of ways, can accept such a principle… If rights\nmake sense, then the degrees of their importance cannot\nbe so different that some count not at all when others are\nmentioned.”465 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n255 There is no antinomy between the right to privacy and the legitimate\n\ngoals of the State. An invasion of privacy has to be proportional to and\n\ncarefully tailored for achieving a legitimate aim. While the right to food is an\n\nimportant right and its promotion is a constitutional obligation of the State, yet\n\nthe right to privacy cannot simply and automatically yield to it. No legitimate\n\ngoal of the State can be allowed at the cost of infringement of a fundamental\n\nright without passing the test of constitutionality. While analysing the\n\narchitecture of Aadhaar, this Court has demonstrated how the purported\n\nsafeguards in the Aadhaar architecture are inadequate to protect the integrity\n\nof personal data, the right of informational self-determination and above all\n\nrights attributable to the privacy-dignity-autonomy trilogy. It is also concluded\n\n465 Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (1977), at pages 203-204\nPART H\n\nthat the Aadhaar scheme is capable of destroying different constitutional\n\nidentities. The financial exclusion caused due to errors in Aadhaar based\n\nauthentication violate the individual’s right to dignity. The Aadhaar scheme\n\ncauses an unwarranted intrusion into fundamental freedoms guaranteed\n\nunder the Indian Constitution since the respondents have failed to\n\ndemonstrate that these measures satisfy the test of necessity and\n\nproportionality.\n\nH.5 Dignity and financial exclusion\n\n256 Our jurisprudence reflects a keen awareness of the need to achieve\n\ndignity. The nine judge Bench decision in Puttaswamy also emphasized the\n\nseminal value of dignity in our constitutional scheme. Human dignity is a\n\nstrengthening bond in the relationship between Parts III and IV of the\n\nConstitution. Reading the Directive Principles contained in Part IV in the\n\ncontext of the right to life (in Part III of the Constitution) has significant\n\nimplications both for the substantive content of the right and on the ability of\n\nthe state in pursuit of its positive obligation to secure conditions of a dignified\n\nexistence. Dignity is an integral element of natural law and an inalienable\n\nconstitutional construct. To lead a dignified life is a constitutional assurance to\n\nan individual. Dr Ambedkar conceptualized four basic premises on which a\n\npolitical democracy can rest:\n\n“Political Democracy rests on four premises which may be set\nout in the following terms:\nPART H\n\n(i) The individual is an end in himself.\n\n(ii) That the individual has certain inalienable rights which\nmust be guaranteed to him by the Constitution.\n\n(iii) That the individual shall not be required to\nrelinquish any of his constitutional rights as a\ncondition precedent to the receipt of a privilege.\n\n(iv) That the State shall not delegate powers to private\npersons to govern others.”466 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nInterpreting the words of Dr Ambedkar in a constitutional context, any action\n\non the part of the State which forces an individual to part with her or his dignity\n\nor any other right under Part III will not be permissible.\n\n257 The experience of living with chronic hunger; recurring uncertainty\n\nabout the availability of food; debt bondage; low and highly underpaid work;\n\nself-denial; and sacrifice of other survival needs, being discriminated\n\nagainst467 are instances of the loss of dignity for the marginalized. The State\n\nhas social security programmes and legislation to improve the living conditions\n\nof the marginalized and to protect their dignity and means of livelihood.\n\nHowever, as documented in the works of Sainath, Dreze, Sen and other\n\nauthors, India has “utterly poor standards of the social services provided to\n\ncommon folk, whether it is the Mid-day Meal Scheme, the Sarva Shiksha\n\nAbhiyan, Integrated Child Development Services, Public Distribution system,\n\nhealthcare at the primary health centres, district hospitals and even public\n\n466Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches (Vol. 1), Dr. Ambedkar Foundation (2014)\n467Harsh Mander, Living with Hunger: Deprivation among the Aged, Single Women and People with Disability,\nEconomic & Political Weekly (April 26, 2008), Vol. 43, available at\nhttps://www.epw.in/journal/2008/17/special-articles/living-hunger-deprivation-among-aged-single-women-and-\npeople\nPART H\n\nhospitals in the state capitals”468. This manner of addressing the deprivations\n\nfaced by the marginalized crushes their dignity.\n\nAny action or inaction on the part of the State which is insensitive to and\n\nunconcerned about protecting the dignity of the marginalized is constitutionally\n\nimpermissible. Denial of benefits arising out of any social security scheme\n\nwhich promotes socio-economic rights of the marginalized, would not be\n\nlegitimate under the Constitution, for the reason that such denial violates\n\nhuman dignity. No individual can be made to part with his or her dignity.\n\nResponsibility for protection of dignity lies not only with governments but also\n\nwith individuals, groups and entities.\n\nIt is in the above background that this Court must deal with the next contention\n\nof the petitioners. The submission of the petitioners is that identity recognition\n\ntechnology may be based on a system which is deterministic or probabilistic.\n\nBiometric authentication systems work on a probabilistic model. For the\n\npurposes of authentication, a comparison is through a template which reduces\n\nthe finger print to a scale and then, a minutea. The claim of the petitioners is\n\nthat as a result, identities are reduced from certainty to a chance.\n\n468Dignity, Not Mere Roti, Economic & Political Weekly (10 August, 2013), Vol. 48, available at\nhttps://www.epw.in/journal/2013/32/editorials/dignity-not-mere-roti.html\nPART H\n\n258 Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act makes it mandatory for an individual to\n\nundergo authentication or furnish proof of possession of an Aadhaar number\n\nin order to avail a subsidy, benefit or service, which incurs expenditure from\n\nthe Consolidated Fund of India. In the Aadhaar based Biometric\n\nAuthentication, the Aadhaar number and biometric information submitted by\n\nan Aadhaar number holder are matched with the biometric information stored\n\nin the CIDR. This may be fingerprints-based or iris-based authentication or\n\nother biometric modalities based on biometric information stored in the\n\nCIDR.469\n\nIt has been submitted that failure of the authentication process results in\n\ndenial of a subsidy, benefit or service contemplated under\nSection 7\nof the\n\nAct. It has been contended that non-enrolment in the Aadhaar scheme and\n\nnon-linking of the Aadhaar number with the benefit, subsidy or service causes\n\nexclusion of eligible beneficiaries. It is the submission of the petitioners that\n\nauthentication of biometrics is faulty, as biometrics are probabilistic in nature.\n\nIt is the case of the petitioners that Aadhaar based biometric authentication\n\noften results in errors and thus leads to exclusion of individuals from\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services provided under\nSection 7\n. Across the country,\n\nit has been urged, several persons are losing out on welfare entitlements\n\nbecause of a biometric mis-match. Mr Divan has argued in his written\n\nsubmissions, that “the project is not an ‘identity’ project but ‘identification’\n\n469 UIDAI, Aadhaar Authentication, available at https://uidai.gov.in/authentication.html\nPART H\n\nexercise and unless the biometrics work, a person in flesh and blood, does not\n\nexist for the state”.\n\nIn order to deal with this contention, it is necessary to understand whether\n\nbiometrics authentication can result in errors in matching. People are identified\n\nby three basic means: “by something they know, something they have, or\n\nsomething they are”.470 Biometrics fall within the last category, and, as such,\n\nshould presumably be less susceptible to being copied or forged. However,\n\nvarious factors can reduce the probability of accurate human identification,\n\nand this increases the probability of a mismatch. Human fallibility can produce\n\nerrors.471\n\n259 In the United States of America, the National Academy of Science\n\npublished a report in 2010 on biometrics titled “Biometric Recognition:\n\nChallenges & Opportunities”472. The report was based on a study carried out\n\nby several reputed scientists and researchers under the aegis of the National\n\nResearch Council, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of\n\nMedicine. This report highlights the nature of biometrics as follows:\n\n“Biometric recognition systems are inherently\nprobabilistic and their performance needs to be assessed\nwithin the context of this fundamental and critical\ncharacteristic. Biometric recognition involves matching, within\n\n470United States General Accounting Office, Technology Assessment: Using Biometrics for Border Security\n(2002), available at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03174.pdf.\n\n471Jeremy Wickins, The ethics of biometrics: the risk of social exclusion from the widespread use of electronic\n\nidentification, Science & Engineering Ethics (2007), at pages 45-54\n472Biometric Recognition: Challenges & Opportunities (Joseph N.

Approximate\nmatching is required due to the variations in biological\nattributes and behaviors both within and between persons.”473\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe report also took note of how changes in an individual’s biometrics may\n\noccur due to a number of factors:\n\n“Biometric characteristics and the information captured\nby biometric systems can be affected by changes in age,\nenvironment, disease, stress, occupational factors,\ntraining and prompting, intentional alterations, socio-\ncultural aspects of the situation in which the\npresentations occurs, changes in human interface with\nthe system, and so on. As a result, each interaction of the\nindividual with the system (at enrolment, identification and so\non) will be associated with different biometric information.\n\nIndividuals attempting to thwart recognition for one reason or\nanother also contribute to the inherent uncertainty in biometric\nsystems.”474 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe report had also stated that biometrics can result in exclusion of people if it\n\nis used for claiming entitlement to a benefit:\n\n“When used in contexts where individuals are claiming\nenrollment or entitlement to a benefit, biometric systems\ncould disenfranchise people who are unable to\nparticipate for physical, social, or cultural reasons. For\nthese reasons, the use of biometrics—especially in\napplications driven by public policy, where the affected\npopulation may have little alternative to participation—merits\ncareful oversight and public discussion to anticipate and\nminimize detrimental societal and individual effects and to\navoid violating privacy and due process rights.\n\nSocial, cultural, and legal issues can affect a system’s\nacceptance by users, its performance, or the decisions on\nwhether to use it in the first place—so it is best to consider\nthese explicitly in system design. Clearly, the behavior of\nthose being enrolled and recognized can influence the\naccuracy and effectiveness of virtually any biometric system,\n\n473 Ibid, at page 3\n474 Ibid\nPART H\n\nand user behavior can be affected by the social, cultural, or\nlegal context. Likewise, the acceptability of a biometric\nsystem depends on the social and cultural values of the\nparticipant populations.”475 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe report underlines that the relationship between an individual’s biometric\n\ntraits and data records has the potential to cause disenfranchisement, when a\n\nsection of the population is excluded from the benefits of positive claim\n\nsystems. The report thus states that:\n\n“Policies and interfaces to handle error conditions such as\nfailure to enroll or be recognized should be designed to\ngracefully avoid violating the dignity, privacy, or due\nprocess rights of the participants.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n260 Els Kindt in a comprehensive research titled “Privacy and Data\n\nProtection Issues of Biometric Applications: A Comparative Legal\n\nAnalysis”476, deals with the nature of biometrics. The book notes that error\n\nrates in biometric systems lead to a situation where entitled data subjects will\n\nbe falsely rejected from the process of database matching. This will adversely\n\naffect the rights of individuals. It has been observed that:\n\n“The error rates imply also that the system will allow\nimpostors. This is equally important because the security of\nbiometric systems should be questioned in case of high false\naccept rates. This element should be given sufficient weight\nin the decision to implement a biometric system for security\npurposes…\n\nOther tests clearly indicated increased error rates for young\npersons, in case of aging, in particular for face and for\ndisabled persons. Individuals with health problems may also\nbe falsely rejected or no longer be recognized, although they\n\n475Ibid, at pages 10-11\n476 Els J. Kindt, Privacy and Data Protection Issues of Biometric Applications: A Comparative Legal Analysis,\nSpringer (2013)\nPART H\n\nwere previously enrolled. In some cases, (non-)enrolment will\nbe a significant problem. It is clear that these data subjects\nneed additional protection.”477\n\nThe book underlines the risk inherent in the limited accuracy of biometrics.478\n\n261 A recently published book titled “Automating Inequality: How High-\n\nTech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor”479, authored by Virginia\n\nEubanks, deals with the impact of data mining, policy algorithms, and\n\npredictive risk models on economic inequality and democracy in America.\n\nEubanks outlines the impacts of automated decision-making on public\n\nservices in the USA through three case studies relating to welfare provision,\n\nhomelessness and child protection services. Eubanks looks at these three\n\nareas in three different parts of the United States: Indiana, Los Angeles and\n\nPittsburgh, to examine what technological automation has done in determining\n\nbenefits and the problems it causes. The author records that in Indiana, one\n\nmillion applications for health care, food stamps, and cash benefits in three\n\nyears were denied, because a new authentication system interpreted any\n\napplication mistake as “failure to cooperate”. In Los Angeles, an algorithm\n\ncalculates the comparative vulnerability of thousands of homeless people so\n\nas to prioritize them for an inadequate pool of housing resources. In\n\nPittsburgh, child services use an algorithm to predict future behaviour.\n\nStatistics are used to predict which children might be future victims of abuse\n\n477 Ibid, at page 363\n478 Ibid\n479 Virginia Eubanks, Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor, St.\n\nMartin's Press (2018)\nPART H\n\nor neglect. Eubanks shows how algorithms have taken over for human\n\ninteraction and understanding. She has argued that automated decision-\n\nmaking is much wider in reach and is likely to have repercussions unknown to\n\nnon-digital mechanisms, such as nineteenth-century poorhouses in America.\n\nPoorhouses were tax-supported residential institutions to which people were\n\nrequired to go if they could not support themselves. 480 People who could not\n\nsupport themselves (and their families) were put up for bid at public auction.\n\nThe person who got the contract (which was for a specific time-frame) got the\n\nuse of the labour of the poor individual(s) for free in return for feeding,\n\nclothing, housing and providing health care for the individual and his/her\n\nfamily. The practice was a form of indentured servitude and hardly had any\n\nrecourse for protection against abuse. Eubanks considers the technology\n\nbased decision-making for poverty management as the extension of the\n\npoorhouses of the 19th century:\n\n“America’s poor and working-class people have long been\nsubject to invasive surveillance, midnight raids, and punitive\npublic policy that increase the stigma and hardship of poverty.\nDuring the nineteenth century, they were quarantined in\ncounty poorhouses. During the twentieth century, they were\ninvestigated by caseworkers, treated like criminals on trial.\nToday, we have forged what I call a digital poorhouse from\ndatabases, algorithms, and risk models. It promises to eclipse\nthe reach and repercussions of everything that came before.\n\nLike earlier technological innovations in poverty management,\ndigital tracking and automated decision-making hide poverty\nfrom the professional middle-class public and give the nation\nthe ethical distance it needs to make inhuman choices: who\ngets food and who starves, who has housing and who\nremains homeless, and which families are broken by the\nstate. The digital poorhouse is a part of a long American\n\n480 Tommy L. Gardner, Spending Your Way to the Poorhouse, Authorhouse (2004), at page 221\nPART H\n\ntradition. We manage the individual poor in order to escape\nour shared responsibility for eradicating poverty.”481\n\nThe author further remarks:\n\n“While poorhouses have been physically demolished, their\nlegacy remains alive and well in the automated decision-\nmaking systems that encage and entrap today's poor. For all\ntheir high-tech polish, our modern systems of poverty\nmanagement - automated decision-making, data mining, and\npredictive analysis - retain a remarkable kinship with the\npoorhouses of the past. Our new digital tools spring from\npunitive, moralistic views of poverty and create a system of\nhigh-tech containment and investigation. The digital\npoorhouse deters the poor from accessing public\nresources; polices their labor, spending, sexuality, and\nparenting; tries to predict their future behavior; and\npunishes and criminalizes those who do not comply with\nits dictates. In the process, it creates ever-finer moral\ndistinctions between the 'deserving' and 'undeserving'\npoor, categorizations that rationalize our national failure\nto care for one another.”482 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nEubanks builds the argument that automated decision-making technology\n\ndoes not act as a facilitator for welfare schemes for the poor and only acts as\n\na gatekeeper:\n\n“New high-tech tools allow for more precise measuring and\ntracking, better sharing of information, and increased visibility\nof targeted populations. In a system dedicated to supporting\npoor and working-class people's self-determination, such\ndiligence would guarantee that they attain all the benefits they\nare entitled to by law. In that context, integrated data and\nmodernized administration would not necessarily result in bad\noutcomes for poor communities. But automated decision-\nmaking in our current welfare system acts a lot like older,\natavistic forms of punishment and containment. It filters and\ndiverts. It is a gatekeeper, not a facilitator.”483\n\n481 Virginia Eubanks, Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor, St.\nMartin's Press (2018), at pages 12-13\n482 Ibid, at page 16\n483 Ibid, at pages 81-82\nPART H\n\nThe crux of the book is reflected in the following extract:\n\n“We all live in the digital poorhouse. We have always lived in\nthe world we built for the poor. We create a society that has\nno use for the disabled or the elderly, and then are cast aside\nwhen we are hurt or grow old. We measure human worth\nbased only on the ability to earn a wage, and suffer in a world\nthat undervalues care and community. We base our economy\non exploiting the labor of racial and ethnic minorities, and\nwatch lasting inequities snuff out human potential. We see the\nworld as inevitably riven by bloody competition and are left\nunable to recognize the many ways we cooperate and lift\neach other up.\n\nBut only the poor lived in the common dorms of the\ncounty poorhouse. Only the poor were put under the\ndiagnostic microscope of scientific clarity.

If a benefit or service is subject\n\nto the matching of biometrics, then any mismatch would result in a denial of\n\nthat benefit or service. Exclusion based on technological errors, with no fault\n\nof the individual, is a violation of dignity. The fate of individuals cannot be left\n\nto the vulnerabilities of technological algorithms or devices. ‘To live is to live\n\n484 Ibid, at page 188\nPART H\n\nwith dignity’.485 Arbitrary exclusion from entitled benefits or subsidies is a\n\nviolation of dignity. If any such project has to survive, then it has to be ensured\n\nthat individual dignity is protected. These concerns have to be addressed.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, concerns regarding the application of biometrics in the\n\nAadhaar project were discussed in 2009 by the Biometrics Standards\n\nCommittee of UIDAI486, which was of the view that the large magnitude of the\n\nAadhaar project raised uncertainty about the accuracy of biometrics. 487 The\n\nStrategy Overview488 published by UIDAI, in 2010, had discussed the risks\n\nassociated with biometrics perceived by UIDAI itself. Under the heading of\n\n‘Project Risk’, the overview stated the UID project does face certain risks in its\n\nimplementation, which have to be addressed through its architecture and in\n\nthe design of its incentives. It stated:\n\n“1) Adoption Risks: There will have to be sufficient, early\ndemand from residents for the UID number. Without critical\nmass among key demographic groups (the rural and the\npoor) the number will not be successful in the long term. To\nensure this, the UIDAI will have to model de-duplication\nand authentication to be both effective and viable for\nparticipating agencies and service providers…\n\n3) Enrolment Risks: The project will have to be carefully\ndesigned to address risks of low enrolment – such as creating\nsufficient touch points in rural areas, enabling and motivating\nRegistrars, ensuring that documentary requirements don't\nderail enrolment in disadvantaged communities – as well as\nmanaging difficulties in address verification, name standards,\nlack of information on date of birth, and hard to record\nfingerprints.\n\n485 Puttaswamy, at para 119\n486 UIDAI Committee on Biometrics, Biometrics Design Standards For UID Applications, at page 4\n487 Ibid\n488 UIDAI, UIDAI Strategy Overview, (2010), available at\n\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/UIDAI%20STRATEGY%20OVERVIEW.pdf\nPART H\n\n4) Risks of Scale: The project will have to handle records\nthat approach one billion in number. This creates\nsignificant risks in biometric de-duplication as well as in\nadministration, storage, and continued expansion of\ninfrastructure.\n\n5) Technology risks: Technology is a key part of the UID\nprogram, and this is the first time in the world that storage,\nauthentication and de-duplication of biometrics are being\nattempted on this scale. The authority will have to address\nthe risks carefully – by choosing the right technology in\nthe architecture, biometrics, and data management tools;\nmanaging obsolescence and data quality; designing the\ntransaction services model and innovating towards the\nbest possible result.\n\n6) Privacy and security risks: The UIDAI will have to ensure\nthat resident data is not shared or compromised.”489\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nTechnological error would result in authentication failures. The concerns\n\nraised by UIDAI ought to have been resolved before the implementation of the\n\nAadhaar project. Poor connectivity in rural India was a major concern. The\n\nmajority of the Indian population lives in rural areas. Even a small percentage\n\nof error results in a population of crores being affected. Denial of subsidies\n\nand benefits to them due to the infirmities of biometric technology is a threat to\n\ngood governance and social parity.\n\n263 The issue of exclusion needs to be considered at three different levels:\n\n(i) before the implementation of the Aadhaar Act, when biometrics were being\n\nused since 2009; (ii) under the provisions of the Act; and (iii) at the practical\n\nlevel during the implementation of the Aadhaar programme.\n\n489 Ibid, at page 38\nPART H\n\nBefore the enactment of the Aadhaar Act in 2016, the Standing Committee on\n\nFinance, which examined the NIA Bill, was concerned about the impact of\n\nAadhaar on marginalized sections of society. Since the availing of subsidies\n\nand benefits was to depend upon Aadhaar based authentication, any error in\n\nthe authentication would result in a denial of the benefits of social security\n\nschemes for the marginalized. In 2011, the report of the Standing Committee\n\nnoted, thus:\n\n“The full or near full coverage of marginalized sections for\nissuing Aadhaar numbers could not be achieved mainly owing\nto two reasons viz. (i) the UIDAI doesn’t have the statistical\ndata relating to them; and (ii) estimated failure of\nbiometrics is expected to be as high as 15% due to a\nlarge chunk of population being dependent on manual\nlabour.”490 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Economic Survey 2016-17 has adverted to authentication failures while\n\ndiscussing the concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI). The Survey, which is\n\nan official document of the Union government, states that UBI is premised on\n\nthe idea that a just society needs to guarantee to each individual a minimum\n\nincome which they can count on, and which provides the necessary material\n\nfoundation for a life with access to basic goods and a life of dignity.491 UBI was\n\nto be implemented by providing cash transfers (for availing benefits of social\n\nsecurity schemes) to the bank accounts of beneficiaries. The implementation\n\nof UBI was to be undertaken through what is described as the JAM trinity:\n\n490 Forty-Second Report of the Standing Committee on Finance (2011), available at\nhttp://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/UID/uid%20report.pdf, at page 30\n491 Government of India, Economic Survey 2016-17, available at\n\nhttps://www.thehinducentre.com/multimedia/archive/03193/Economic_Survey_20_3193543a.pdf, at\npage 173\nPART H\n\nJan-Dhan Bank Accounts, Aadhaar data and Mobile phones. However, the\n\nSurvey noted that while Aadhaar is designed to solve the identification\n\nproblem, it cannot solve the “targeting problem” on its own. The Survey\n\nemphasized the need to build state capacity and that “the state will still have\n\nto enhance its capacities to provide a whole range of public goods”.492 The\n\nSurvey has recorded the statistics of authentication failures of Aadhaar in\n\nseveral regions of the country:\n\n“While Aadhaar coverage speed has been exemplary, with\nover a billion Aadhaar cards being distributed, some states\nreport authentication failures: estimates include 49 percent\nfailure rates for Jharkhand, 6 percent for Gujarat, 5 percent\nfor Krishna District in Andhra Pradesh and 37 percent for\nRajasthan. Failure to identify genuine beneficiaries results in\nexclusion errors.”493\n\nNo failure rate in the provision of social welfare benefits can be regarded as\n\nacceptable. Basic entitlements in matters such as foodgrain, can brook no\n\nerror. To deny food is to lead a family to destitution, malnutrition and even\n\ndeath.\n\n264 A recent Office Memorandum dated 19 December 2017 issued by the\n\nCabinet Secretariat of the Union government494 acknowledges that the\n\nAadhaar enrolment process has not been completed and that infrastructure\n\nconstraints are capable of posing difficulties in online authentication. The\n\nMemorandum provides that those beneficiaries who do not possess Aadhaar,\n\n492 Ibid, at page 174\n493 Ibid, at page 194\n494 Office Memorandum dated 19 December 2017, available at\n\nhttps://dbtbharat.gov.in/data/om/Office%20Memorandum_Aadhaar.pdf\nPART H\n\nshall be provided a subsidy, benefit or service based on alternate identification\n\ndocuments as contemplated by Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act. It also requires\n\nefforts to be made to ensure that all beneficiaries are facilitated to get\n\nenrolment under the Aadhaar programme. The Memorandum creates a\n\nmechanism for availing subsidies, benefits or services in cases where\n\nAadhaar authentication fails:\n\n(i) Departments and Bank Branches may make provisions for IRIS scanners\n\nalong with fingerprint scanners wherever feasible;\n\n(ii) In cases of failure due to lack of connectivity, offline authentication\n\nsystems such as QR code based coupons, Mobile based OTP or TOTP\n\nmay be explored; and\n\n(iii) In all cases where online authentication is not feasible, the benefit/service\n\nmay be provided on the basis of possession of Aadhaar, after duly\n\nrecording the transaction in a register, to be reviewed and audited\n\nperiodically.\n\nThe figures from the Economic Survey of India indicate that there are millions\n\nof eligible beneficiaries across India who have suffered financial exclusion.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat has pro-actively acknowledged the need to address\n\nmatters of exclusion by implementing alternate modalities, apart from those\n\nset out in\nSection 7\n. Options (i) and (ii) above were to be implemented in\n\nfuture. This exercise should have been undertaken by the government in\n\nadvance. Problems have to be anticipated when a project is on the drawing\nPART H\n\nboard, not after severe deprivations have been caused by the denial of social\n\nwelfare benefits.\n\n265 Exclusion of citizens from availing benefits of social security schemes\n\nbecause of failures or errors in Aadhaar based biometric authentication has\n\nalso been documented in research studies and academic writings published\n\nby members of civil society, including Reetika Khera and Jean Dreze. Similar\n\ntestimonies have been recorded in affidavits submitted before this Court by\n\ncivil society activists. Hearing the voices of civil society must be an integral\n\npart of the structural design of a project, such as Aadhaar. In the absence of a\n\ncredible mechanism to receive and respond to feed-back, the state has to\n\ndepend on its own personnel who may not always provide reliable and candid\n\nassessments of performance and failure.\n\n266 ABBA (Aadhaar based biometric authentication) refers to the practice of\n\ninstalling a Point of Sale (PoS) machine equipped with a fingerprint reader and\n\nauthenticating a person each time she accesses her entitlements.495 Dreze\n\nhas stated that for successful authentication in PDS outlets, several\n\ntechnologies need to work simultaneously.496 These are497:\n\n495Reetika Khera, Impact of Aadhaar on Welfare Programmes, Economic & Political Weekly, Vol. 52 (16\nDecember 2017), available at https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/50/special-articles/impact-aadhaar-welfare-\nprogrammes.html\n496Jean Dreze, Dark clouds over the PDS, The Hindu (10 September 2016), available at\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/Dark-clouds-over-the-PDS/article14631030.ece\n497 Anmol Somanchi, Srujana Bej, and Mrityunjay Pandey, Well Done ABBA?

If it malfunctions, no transaction can be\n\nmade. The first step in the process requires the dealer to enter the ration\n\ncard number of the beneficiary’s household onto the PoS machine;\n\n(c) Internet connection: Successful working of the PoS machine depends on\n\ninternet connectivity as verification of the ration card number and the\n\nbeneficiary’s biometric fingerprint is carried out over the internet;\n\n(d) Remote Aadhaar servers: Remote Aadhaar servers verify the ration card\n\nnumber and initiate fingerprint authentication; and\n\n(e) Fingerprint recognition software: The beneficiary proves her identity by\n\nsubmitting to fingerprint recognition in the PoS machine. Upon verification,\n\nthe PoS machine indicates that the beneficiary is genuine and that\n\nfoodgrains can be distributed to her household.\n\nThe above procedure requires that at the time of purchase of PDS grains each\n\nmonth, any one person listed on the ration card needs to authenticate\n\nthemselves. Similarly, for pensions, elderly persons must go to the point of\n\ndelivery to authenticate themselves. Reetika Khera has observed that since\n\nABBA on PoS machines is currently a monthly activity, so each of its\nPART H\n\nassociated technologies (correct Aadhaar-seeding, mobile connectivity,\n\nelectricity, functional PoS machines and UIDAI servers and fingerprint\n\nrecognition) needs to work for a person to get their entitlement.498 Dreze has\n\nreferred to the above procedure as “a wholly inappropriate technology for rural\n\nIndia”499. Network failures and other glitches routinely disable this sort of\n\ntechnology. Dreze has further observed that in villages with poor connectivity,\n\nit is a “recipe for chaos”500.\n\n267 A government-commissioned sample study501 in Andhra Pradesh to\n\nascertain the efficiency of Aadhaar-based social programmes in the case of\n\nsubsidised grains indicated that technical deficiencies are depriving the poor\n\nof their access to food. The study was commissioned by the state government\n\nafter it was found that 22% of the PDS beneficiaries did not take the ration in\n\nthe month of May 2015. The sample study, which covered five PDS outlets in\n\nthree districts, found that half of the beneficiaries of PDS in the surveyed\n\nareas could not access their ration quota due to glitches, lack of training and\n\nmismatches linked to Aadhaar.

The\n\nsurvey revealed that among 80 surveyed households, 89% reported receiving\n\nfull entitlements at correct prices even before the introduction of Aadhaar-\n\nbased biometric authentication (ABBA). In contrast, 10% of households were\n\nexcluded due to authentication failures due to reported errors with one or\n\nmore of its five technological components.\n\n268 An article titled “Aadhaar and Food Security in Jharkhand: Pain\n\nwithout Gain?”503, based on a household survey in rural Jharkhand,\n\nexamines various issues related to compulsory ABBA for availing PDS\n\nbenefits. The article notes the impact of PDS on the lives of the rural poor,\n\nwho visit the ration shop every month. In “their fragile and uncertain lives”, the\n\nPDS provides a “modicum of food and economic security”. The article notes\n\nthat in ABBA, the failure of authentication results in denial of food from ration\n\nshops. The household is unable to get food rations for no fault of its own.

The article further notes that ABBA has neither failed to\n\nreduce quantity fraud (which is the main form of PDS corruption in\n\nJharkhand), nor has it helped to address other critical shortcomings of the\n\nPDS in Jharkhand, such as the problem of missing names in ration cards, the\n\nidentification of Antyodaya (poorest of the poor) households, or the arbitrary\n\npower of private dealers. The article identifies poor internet connectivity as\n\none of the reasons for authentication failures and eventual exclusion:\n\n“Sporadic internet connectivity is another major hurdle.\nSometimes, light rain is enough to disrupt connectivity or the\nelectricity supply. Every step in the ABBA process—ration\ncard verification, biometric authentication, electronic upload of\ntransactions, updating NFSA [\nNational Food Security Act\n] lists\nand entitlements on the PoS504 [Point of Sale] machine—\ndepends on internet connectivity. Further, even with stable\nconnectivity, biometric authentication is not always easy.\nBiometric failures are especially common for two groups: the\nelderly, and manual labourers. Both are particularly\nvulnerable to food insecurity.”505\n\nThe article regards the denial of basic services to the poor due to failure of\n\nABBA as a form of grave injustice:\n\n504 Ibid, at page 51. The article states: “[PoS] is a handheld device installed at every PDS outlet (“ration shop”)\nand connected to the Internet. The list of ration cards attached to that outlet, and their respective entitlements,\nare stored in the PoS machine and updated every month. When a cardholder turns ups, the PoS machine first\n“authenticates” her by matching her fingerprints with the biometric data stored against her Aadhaar number in\nthe Central Identities Data Repository (CIDR). The machine then generates a receipt with the person’s\nentitlements, which are also audible from a recorded message... The transaction details are also supposed to\nbe entered by the dealer in the person’s ration card.”\n505 Ibid, at page 55\nPART H\n\n“Imposing a technology that does not work on people\nwho depend on it for their survival is a grave injustice.”506\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nAs we have noted in an earlier part of this judgment, even the Economic\n\nSurvey of India 2016-17 found a 49% failure rate for beneficiaries in\n\nJharkhand and 37% in Rajasthan. Those at the receiving end are the poorest\n\nof the poor.\n\nReetika Khera looks at the impact of Aadhaar-integration with security\n\nschemes (primarily in MGNREGA, PDS and social security pensions). 507 The\n\nauthor also discusses briefly the impact of Aadhaar on liquefied petroleum gas\n\n(LPG) subsidy and the application of Aadhaar in the mid-day meal (MDM)\n\nscheme. In coming to its conclusions, the article has relied upon quantitative\n\ndata from primary field studies, secondary data from government portals,\n\nfigures obtained through queries made under the\nRight to Information (RTI)\n\nAct\n, and responses to questions in Parliament. In Khera’s words, Aadhaar is\n\nbecoming a “tool of exclusion”:\n\n“Savings or exclusion? The government claimed that\nAadhaar integration saved 399 crore up to 31 December\n2016 (GoI 2017c). At a given level of benefits, a reduction in\ngovernment expenditure in any particular transfer scheme\ncan be on two counts: removal of ghosts and duplicates\n(“efficiency”); and a fall in the number of genuine beneficiaries\n(“shrinkage”), for instance, if they do not link their Aadhaar\nnumbers when required. Across welfare schemes, the\ngovernment has been treating any reduction in expenditure\nas “savings,” even when it comes from shrinkage. This is true\n\n506Ibid, at page 58\n507 Reetika Khera, Impact of Aadhaar on Welfare Programmes, Economic & Political Weekly, Vol. 52 (16\nDecember 2017), available at https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/50/special-articles/impact-aadhaar-welfare-\n\nprogrammes.html\nPART H\n\nfor SSP [social security pension] as well. For instance, in\nRajasthan, pensioners were “mistakenly” recorded as dead\nand this was presented as Aadhaar-enabled savings (Yadav\n2016f). In Jharkhand too, pensioners’ names have been\ndeleted because they did not complete Aadhaar-seeding\nformalities or pensions stopped due to seeding errors (Sen\n2017a). Studying 100 pensioners, selected from 10 randomly-\nselected villages from five blocks of Ranchi district in\nFebruary 2017, Biswas (2017) finds that 84% of her\nrespondents receive pensions but irregularity in payments\nwas a big issue. The remaining 16% were not receiving it due\nto Aadhaar-related issues.”508\n\nPuja Awasthi documents the plight of individuals suffering from leprosy, who\n\nhave been denied pensions due to not being able to get enrolled into the\n\nAadhaar system. Leprosy can damage fingerprints and thus make an\n\nindividual incapable of providing biometrics. Awasthi’s article509 notes that\n\nAadhaar is capable of causing a denial of benefits or services to 86,000\n\ncitizens, who suffer from leprosy.\n\nThese writings show how in most cases, an authentication failure means that\n\nthe individual/household was denied the benefit of a social security\n\nprogramme for no fault of their own.

For persons, who are engaged\n\nin manual labour, and persons who are disabled or aged, fingerprints actually\n\ncannot be captured by biometric devices. The material which has been relied\n\nupon in this segment originates from government’s official documents as well\n\nas from distinguished academics and researchers from civil society. There\n\nexist serious issues of financial exclusion. Pensions for the aged particularly\n\nin cases where a pension is earned for past service – are not charity or doles.\n\nThey constitute legal entitlements. For an old age pensioner, vicissitudes of\n\ntime and age obliterate fingerprints. Hard manual labour severely impacts\n\nupon fingerprints. The elderly, the disabled and the young are the most\n\nvulnerable and a denial of social welfare entitlements verily results in a\n\ndeprivation of the right to life. Should the scholarship of a girl child or a mid-\n\nday meal for the young be made to depend on the uncertainties of biometric\n\nmatches? Our quest for technology should not be oblivious to the country’s\n\nreal problems: social exclusion, impoverishment and marginalisation. The\n\nAadhaar project suffers from crucial design flaws which impact upon its\n\nstructural probity. Structural design in delivering welfare entitlements must be\n\ncompliant with structural due process, to be in accord with\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n\nThe Aadhaar project has failed to account for and remedy the flaws in its\n\nframework and design which lead to serious issues of exclusion. Dignity and\n\nrights of individuals cannot be based on algorithms or probabilities.\n\nConstitutional guarantees cannot be subject to the vicissitudes of technology.\nPART H\n\n270 Structural due process imposes requirements on public institutions and\n\nprojects at the macro level. Structural due process requires that the delivery\n\nof social welfare benefits must be effective and timely. Those who are eligible\n\nfor the benefits must not face exclusion. Procedures for the disbursal of\n\nbenefits must not be oppressive. They must be capable of compliance both by\n\nthose who disburse and by those who receive the benefits. Deployment of\n\ntechnology must factor in the available of technological resources in every part\n\nof the coverage area and the prevailing levels of literacy and awareness.\n\nAbove all, the design of the project will be compliant with structural due\n\nprocess only if it is responsive to deficiencies, accountable to the beneficiaries\n\nand places the burden of ensuring that the benefits reach the marginalised on\n\nthe state and its agencies.\n\nH.6 Constitutional validity of\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act 1961 which was inserted by the\n\nFinance Act\n2017, mandates the quoting of an Aadhaar number in the application\n\nfor a Permanent Account Number (PAN) and in the return of income tax. Failure\n\nto intimate an Aadhaar number results in the PAN being deemed invalid\n\nretrospectively.\n\nSection 139AA\nreads thus:\n\n“Quoting of Aadhaar number.- (1) Every person who is\neligible to obtain Aadhaar number shall, on or after the 1st\nday of July, 2017, quote Aadhaar number-\n\n(i) in the application form for allotment of permanent\naccount number;\nPART H\n\n(ii) in the return of income:\n\nProvided that where the person does not possess\nthe Aadhaar Number, the Enrolment ID of\nAadhaar application form issued to him at the time\nof enrolment shall be quoted in the application for\npermanent account number or, as the case may\nbe, in the return of income furnished by him.\n\n(2) Every person who has been allotted permanent account\nnumber as on the 1st day of July, 2017, and who is eligible to\nobtain Aadhaar number, shall intimate his Aadhaar number to\nsuch authority in such form and manner as may be\nprescribed, on or before a date to be notified by the Central\nGovernment in the Official Gazette:\n\nProvided that in case of failure to intimate the\nAadhaar number, the permanent account number\nallotted to the person shall be deemed to be\ninvalid and the other provisions of this Act shall\napply, as if the person had not applied for\nallotment of permanent account number.\n\n(3) The provisions of this Section shall not apply to such\nperson or class or classes of persons or any State or part of\nany State, as may be notified by the Central Government in\nthis behalf, in the Official Gazette.\n\nExplanation. - For the purposes of this section, the\nexpressions –\n\n(i) “Aadhaar number”, “Enrolment” and “resident”\nshall have the same meanings respectively\nassigned to them in Clauses (a), (m) and (v) of\n\nSection 2\nof the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of\nFinancial and other Subsidies, Benefits and\nServices) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016);\n\n(ii) “Enrolment ID” means a 28 digit Enrolment\nIdentification Number issued to a resident at the\ntime of enrolment.”\n\n272 In Binoy Viswam v Union of India (“Binoy Viswam”),511 a two judge\n\nBench (consisting of Dr Justice AK Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan) upheld\n\nthe constitutional validity of\nSection 139AA\n. Since the issue of whether privacy\n\nis a constitutionally guaranteed right was pending before a Bench of nine\n\njudges (the decision in Puttaswamy was still to be delivered), the two judge\n\n511 (2017) 7 SCC 59\nPART H\n\nBench did not dwell on the challenge to the legislation on the ground of\n\nprivacy and under\nArticle 21.\nThe Bench examined other submissions based\n\non\nArticles 14\nand\nand on the competence of Parliament to enact the law.\n\n273 The decision in Binoy Viswam holds that in assessing the\n\nconstitutional validity of a law, two grounds of judicial review are available:\n\n(i) The legislative competence of the law-making body which has enacted\n\nthe law, over the subject of legislation; and\n\n(ii) Compliance with Part III of the Constitution, which enunciates the\n\nfundamental rights, and with the other provisions of the Constitution.\n\nHolding that a third ground of challenge – that the law in question is arbitrary –\n\nis not available, the decision in Binoy Viswam placed reliance on the\n\nenunciation of law by a three judge Bench in State of A P v McDowell & Co\n\n(Mcdowell).512 McDowell ruled that while a challenge to a statute on the\n\nground that it violates the principle of equality under\nArticle 14\nis available, a\n\nstatute cannot be invalidated on the ground that it is arbitrary:\n\n“43…In other words, say, if an enactment is challenged as\nviolative of\nArticle 14\n, it can be struck down only if it is found\nthat it is violative of the equality clause/equal protection\nclause enshrined therein…\nNo enactment can be struck down by just saying that it is\narbitrary or unreasonable. Some or other constitutional\ninfirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act.”513\n\n512 (1996) 3 SCC 709\n513 Ibid, at page 124\nPART H\n\nIn Binoy Viswam, the two judge Bench observed that the “contours” of\n\njudicial review had been spelt out in\nState of Madhya Pradesh v Rakesh\n\nKohli,514\nand more recently in Rajbala v State of Haryana.515 Reiterating the\n\nsame position, Binoy Viswam holds:\n\n“81.Another aspect in this context, which needs to be\nemphasised, is that a legislation cannot be declared\nunconstitutional on the ground that it is “arbitrary” inasmuch\nas examining as to whether a particular Act is arbitrary or not\nimplies a value judgment and the courts do not examine the\nwisdom of legislative choices and, therefore, cannot\nundertake this exercise.”516\n\n274 In the decision of the Constitution Bench in Shayara Bano v Union of\n\nIndia (“Shayara Bano”),517 Justice Rohinton Nariman speaking for himself\n\nand Justice Uday U Lalit noticed that the dictum in McDowell, to the effect\n\nthat “no enactment can be struck down by just saying it is arbitrary or\n\nunreasonable” had failed to notice the judgment of the Constitution Bench in\n\nAjay Hasia v Khalid Mujib Sehravardi (“Ajay Hasia”\n),518 and a three judge\n\nBench decision in Dr K R Lakshmanan v State of T N (“Lakshmanan”).519\n\nIn Ajay Hasia, the Constitution Bench traced the evolution of the doctrine of\n\nequality beyond its origins in the doctrine of classification.\n\nAjay Hasia ruled\n\nthat since the decision in\nE P Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu,520\nit had been\n\nheld that equality had a substantive content which, simply put, was the\n\nantithesis of arbitrariness. Consequently:\n\n514 (2012) 6 SCC 312\n515 (2016) 2 SCC 445\n516 Ibid, at page 125\n517 (2017) 9 SCC 1\n518 (1981) 1 SCC 722\n519 (1996) 2 SCC 226\n520 (1974) 4 SCC 3\nPART H\n\n“16...Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State\naction whether it be of the legislature or of the executive\nor of an “authority” under\nArticle 12\n,\nArticle 14\n\nimmediately springs into action and strikes down such\nState action. In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non-\n\narbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is\na golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of\nthe Constitution.”521 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe principle of arbitrariness was applied for invalidating a State law by the\n\nthree judge Bench decision in Lakshmanan. It was, in this context that Justice\n\nNariman speaking for two Judges in the Constitution Bench in Shayara Bano\n\nheld that manifest arbitrariness is a component of\nArticle 14.\nHence, a law\n\nwhich is manifestly arbitrary would violate the fundamental right to equality:\n\n“87. The thread of reasonableness runs through the entire\nfundamental rights chapter. What is manifestly arbitrary is\nobviously unreasonable and being contrary to the rule of law,\nwould violate\nArticle 14.\nFurther, there is an apparent\ncontradiction in the three-Judge Bench decision in McDowell\nwhen it is said that a constitutional challenge can succeed on\nthe ground that a law is “disproportionate, excessive or\nunreasonable”, yet such challenge would fail on the very\nground of the law being “unreasonable, unnecessary or\nunwarranted”. The arbitrariness doctrine when applied to\nlegislation obviously would not involve the latter challenge but\nwould only involve a law being disproportionate, excessive or\notherwise being manifestly unreasonable. All the aforesaid\ngrounds, therefore, do not seek to differentiate between State\naction in its various forms, all of which are interdicted if they\nfall foul of the fundamental rights guaranteed to persons and\ncitizens in Part III of the Constitution.”522\n\nJustice Nariman has observed that even after McDowell, challenges to the\n\nvalidity of legislation have been entertained on the ground of arbitrariness\n\n521 Ajay Hasia at page 741\n522 Ibid, at pages 91-92\nPART H\n\n(Malpe Vishwanath Acharya v State of Maharashtra,523 Mardia Chemicals\n\nLtd. v Union of India,524 State of Tamil Nadu v K Shyam Sunder,525\n\nAndhra Pradesh Dairy Development Corporation Federation v B\n\nNarasimha Reddy526 and K T Plantation Private Limited v State of\n\nKarnataka527).\n\n275 In Shayara Bano, Justice Nariman has adverted to the decisions which\n\nhave followed McDowell including the two judge Bench decision in Binoy\n\nViswam. These decisions, in the view of Justice Nariman, are therefore no\n\nlonger good law:\n\n“99. However, in\nState of Bihar v. Bihar Distillery Ltd.\n, SCC at\npara 22, in\nState of M.P. v. Rakesh Kohli\n, SCC at paras 17 to\n19, in\nRajbala v. State of Haryana\n, SCC at paras 53 to 65 and\nin\nBinoy Viswam v. Union of India\n, SCC at paras 80 to\n82, McDowell was read as being an absolute bar to the use of\n“arbitrariness” as a tool to strike down legislation under Article\n\n14. As has been noted by us earlier in this\njudgment, McDowell itself is per incuriam, not having noticed\nseveral judgments of Benches of equal or higher strength, its\nreasoning even otherwise being flawed. The judgments,\nfollowing McDowell are, therefore, no longer good law.”528\n\nIn the above extract, Justice Nariman has specifically held that the McDowell\n\ntest which barred a challenge to a law on the ground of arbitrariness ignored a\n\nbinding Constitution Bench view in Ajay Hasia and that of a three judge\n\nBench in Lakshmanan. Moreover, the above extract from Shayara Bano\n\n523 (1998) 2 SCC 1\n524 (2004) 4 SCC 311\n525 (2011) 8 SCC 737\n526 (2011) 9 SCC 286\n527 (2011) 9 SCC 1\n528 Ibid, at page 97\nPART H\n\ndisapproves of the restriction on judicial review in Binoy Viswam, which\n\nfollows McDowell. Justice Kurian Joseph, in the course of his decision has\n\nspecifically agreed with the view expressed by Justice Nariman:\n\n“5…However, on the pure question of law that a legislation,\nbe it plenary or subordinate, can be challenged on the ground\nof arbitrariness, I agree with the illuminating exposition of law\nby Nariman J. I am also of the strong view that the\nconstitutional democracy of India cannot conceive of a\nlegislation which is arbitrary.”\n\n276 In Puttaswamy, the judgment delivered on behalf of four Judges\n\nexpressly recognized the impact of\nArticle 14\nin determining whether a law\n\nwhich is challenged on the ground that it violates\nArticle 21\nmeets both the\n\nprocedural as well as the substantive content of reasonableness. The Court\n\nheld:\n\n“291… the evolution of\nArticle 21\n, since the decision\nin Cooper indicates two major areas of change. First, the\nfundamental rights are no longer regarded as isolated silos or\nwatertight compartments. In consequence,\nArticle 14\nhas\nbeen held to animate the content of\nArticle 21.\nSecond, the\nexpression “procedure established by law” in\nArticle 21\ndoes\nnot connote a formalistic requirement of a mere presence of\nprocedure in enacted law. That expression has been held to\nsignify the content of the procedure and its quality which must\nbe fair, just and reasonable. The mere fact that the law\nprovides for the deprivation of life or personal liberty is not\nsufficient to conclude its validity and the procedure to be\nconstitutionally valid must be fair, just and reasonable. The\nquality of reasonableness does not attach only to the content\nof the procedure which the law prescribes with reference to\n\nArticle 21\nbut to the content of the law itself. In other words,\nthe requirement of\nArticle 21\nis not fulfilled only by the\nenactment of fair and reasonable procedure under the law\nand a law which does so may yet be susceptible to challenge\non the ground that its content does not accord with the\nrequirements of a valid law. The law is open to substantive\nchallenge on the ground that it violates the fundamental\nright.”529\n\n529 Ibid, at page 495\nPART H\n\nThe same principle has been emphasized in the following observations:\n\n“294…Article 14, as a guarantee against arbitrariness, infuses\nthe entirety of\nArticle 21.\nThe interrelationship between the\nguarantee against arbitrariness and the protection of life and\npersonal liberty operates in a multi-faceted plane. First, it\nensures that the procedure for deprivation must be fair, just\nand reasonable. Second,\nArticle 14\nimpacts both the\nprocedure and the expression “law”. A law within the meaning\nof\nArticle 21\nmust be consistent with the norms of fairness\nwhich originate in\nArticle 14.\nAs a matter of principle, once\n\nArticle 14\nhas a connect with\nArticle 21\n, norms of fairness and\nreasonableness would apply not only to the procedure but to\nthe law as well.”530\n\n277 In Binoy Viswam, the two judge Bench held that while enrolment\n\nunder the Aadhaar Act is voluntary, it was legitimately open to the Parliament,\n\nwhile enacting\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act to make the seeding of\n\nthe Aadhaar number with the PAN card mandatory. The court held that the\n\npurpose of making it mandatory under the\nIncome Tax Act\nwas to curb black\n\nmoney, money laundering and tax evasion. It was open to Parliament to do so\n\nand its legislative competence could not be questioned on that ground. The\n\ncourt held that the legislative purpose of unearthing black money and curbing\n\nmoney laundering furnished a valid nexus with the objective sought to be\n\nachieved by the law:\n\n“105. Unearthing black money or checking money laundering\nis to be achieved to whatever extent possible. Various\nmeasures can be taken in this behalf. If one of the measures\nis introduction of Aadhaar into the tax regime, it cannot be\ndenounced only because of the reason that the purpose\nwould not be achieved fully. Such kind of menace, which is\ndeep-rooted, needs to be tackled by taking multiple actions\nand those actions may be initiated at the same time. It is the\ncombined effect of these actions which may yield results and\n\n530 Ibid, at page 496\nPART H\n\neach individual action considered in isolation may not be\nsufficient. Therefore, rationality of a particular measure\ncannot be challenged on the ground that it has no nexus with\nthe objective to be achieved. Of course, there is a definite\nobjective. For this purpose alone, individual measure cannot\nbe ridiculed. We have already taken note of the\nrecommendations of SIT on black money headed by Justice\nM.B. Shah. We have also reproduced the measures\nsuggested by the Committee headed by Chairman, CBDT on\n“Measures to Tackle Black Money in India and Abroad”. They\nhave, in no uncertain terms, suggested that one singular\nproof of identity of a person for entering into finance/business\ntransactions, etc. may go a long way in curbing this foul\npractice. That apart, even if solitary purpose of de-duplication\nof PAN cards is taken into consideration, that may be\nsufficient to meet the second test of\nArticle 14.\nIt has come on\nrecord that 11.35 lakh cases of duplicate PAN or fraudulent\nPAN cards have already been detected and out of this 10.52\nlakh cases pertain to individual assessees. Seeding of\nAadhaar with PAN has certain benefits which have already\nbeen enumerated. Furthermore, even when we address the\nissue of shell companies, fact remains that companies are\nafter all floated by individuals and these individuals have to\nproduce documents to show their identity. It was sought to be\nargued that persons found with duplicate/bogus PAN cards\nare hardly 0.4% and, therefore, there was no need to have\nsuch a provision. We cannot go by percentage figures. The\nabsolute number of such cases is 10.52 lakhs, which figure,\nby no means, can be termed as miniscule, to harm the\neconomy and create adverse effect on the nation. The\nrespondents have argued that Aadhaar will ensure that there\nis no duplication of identity as biometrics will not allow that\nand, therefore, it may check the growth of shell companies as\nwell.\n\n106. Having regard to the aforesaid factors, it cannot be said\nthat there is no nexus with the objective sought to be\nachieved.”531\n\nThe court observed that it was a harsh reality of our times that the benefit of\n\nwelfare measures adopted by the State does not reach the segments of\n\nsociety for whom they are intended:\n\n“125.1.3… However, for various reasons including corruption,\nactual benefit does not reach those who are supposed to\nreceive such benefits. One of the main reasons is failure to\n\n531 Ibid, at pages 134-135\nPART H\n\nidentify these persons for lack of means by which identity\ncould be established of such genuine needy class.\n\nResultantly, lots of ghosts and duplicate beneficiaries are able\nto take undue and impermissible benefits. A former Prime\nMinister of this country has gone on record to say that out of\none rupee spent by the Government for welfare of the\ndowntrodden, only 15 paisa thereof actually reaches those\npersons for whom it is meant. It cannot be doubted that with\nUID/Aadhaar much of the malaise in this field can be taken\ncare of.”532\n\nIn this context, the court also noted that as a result of de-duplication\n\nexercises, 11.35 lakh cases of duplicate PANs / fraudulent PANs had been\n\ndetected out of which 10.52 lakh cases pertained to individual assesses. The\n\ncourt upheld the decision of Parliament as the legislating body of seeding\n\nPANs with Aadhaar as “the best method, and the only robust method of de-\n\nduplication of PAN database”.\n\n278 The edifice of\nSection 139AA\nis based on the structure created by the\n\nAadhaar Act.\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax Act 1962 is postulated on the\n\nrequirement of Aadhaar having been enacted under a valid piece of\n\nlegislation. The validity of the legislation seeding Aadhaar to PAN is\n\ndependent upon and cannot be segregated from the validity of the parent\n\nAadhaar legislation. In fact, that is one of the reasons why in Binoy Viswam,\n\nthe\nArticle 21\nchallenge was not adjudicated upon since that was pending\n\nconsideration before a larger Bench. The validity of seeding Aadhaar to PAN\n\nunder\nSection 139AA\nmust therefore depend upon the constitutional validity of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act as it is determined by this Court. Further Rule 114B of the\n\n532 Ibid, at page 146\nPART H\n\nIncome Tax Rules 1962 provides for a list of transactions for which a person\n\nmust quote a PAN card number. Rule 114B requires that a person must\n\npossess a PAN card for those transactions. These are summarized below:\n\n• “Sale or purchase of a motor vehicle or vehicle, as\ndefined in clause (28) of\nsection 2\nof the Motor Vehicles\nAct, 1988 (59 of 1988) which requires registration by a\nregistering authority under Chapter IV of that Act, other\nthan two wheeled vehicles.\n\n• Opening an account [other than a time-deposit and a\nBasic Savings Bank Deposit Account] with a banking\ncompany or a co-operative bank to which the\nBanking\nRegulation Act, 1949\n(10 of 1949), applies (including any\nbank or banking institution referred to in\nsection 51\nof that\nAct).\n\n• Making an application to any banking company or a co-\noperative bank to which the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n\n(10 of 1949), applies (including any bank or banking\ninstitution referred to in\nsection 51\nof that Act) or to any\nother company or institution, for issue of a credit or debit\ncard.\n\n• Opening of a demat account with a depository,\nparticipant, custodian of securities or any other person\nregistered under sub-section (1A) of\nsection 12\nof the\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of\n1992).\n\n• Payment to a hotel or restaurant against a bill or bills at\nany one time.\n\n• Payment in connection with travel to any foreign country\nor payment for purchase of any foreign currency at any\none time.\n\n• Payment to a Mutual Fund for purchase of its units.\n• Payment to a company or an institution for acquiring\ndebentures or bonds issued by it.\n\n• Payment to the Reserve Bank of India, constituted under\nsection 3 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of\n1934) for acquiring bonds issued by it.\n\n• Deposit with,—\n• banking company or a co-operative bank to which\nthe\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n(10 of 1949),\napplies (including any bank or banking institution\nreferred to in\nsection 51\nof that Act);\n\n• Post Office.\n\n• Purchase of bank drafts or pay orders or banker's\ncheques from a banking company or a co-operative bank\nto which the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n(10 of 1949),\nPART H\n\napplies (including any bank or banking institution referred\nto in\nsection 51\nof that Act).\n\n• A time deposit with, —\n• a banking company or a co-operative bank to which\nthe\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n(10 of 1949),\napplies (including any bank or banking institution\nreferred to in\nsection 51\nof that Act);\n\n• a Post Office;\n\n• a Nidhi referred to in\nsection 406\nof the Companies\nAct, 2013 (18 of 2013); or\n• a non-banking financial company which holds a\ncertificate of registration under\nsection 45-IA\nof the\nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934), to hold\nor accept deposit from public.\n\n• Payment for one or more pre-paid payment instruments,\nas defined in the policy guidelines for issuance and\noperation of pre-paid payment instruments issued by\nReserve Bank of India under\nsection 18\nof the Payment\nand Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (51 of 2007), to a\nbanking company or a co-operative bank to which the\n\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949\n(10 of 1949), applies\n(including any bank or banking institution referred to in\n\nsection 51\nof that Act) or to any other company or\ninstitution.\n\n• Payment as life insurance premium to an insurer as\ndefined in clause (9) of\nsection 2\nof the Insurance Act,\n1938 (4 of 1938).\n\n• A contract for sale or purchase of securities (other than\nshares) as defined in clause (h) of\nsection 2\nof the\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956).\n• Sale or purchase, by any person, of shares of a company\nnot listed in a recognised stock exchange.\n\n• Sale or purchase of any immovable property.\n• Sale or purchase, by any person, of goods or services of\nany nature other than those specified above.”\n\nThe decision in Puttaswamy has recognised that protection of the interests of\n\nthe revenue constitutes a legitimate state aim in the three-pronged test of\n\nproportionality. The circumstances which have been adverted to in the\n\ndecision in Binoy Viswam are a sufficient indicator of the legitimate concerns\n\nof the revenue to curb tax evasion, by embarking upon a programme for de-\n\nduplication of the Pan data base. A legitimate state aim does exist. However,\nPART H\n\nthat in itself is not sufficient to uphold the validity of the law, which must meet\n\nthe other parameters of proportionality spelt out in Puttaswamy. The\n\nexplanation to\nSection 139AA\nadopts the definition of the expressions\n\n‘Aadhaar number’, ‘enrolment’ and ‘resident’ from the parent Aadhaar\n\nlegislation. The seeding of Aadhaar with Pan cards must depend for its validity\n\non the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar legislation. Hence, besides\n\naffirming that the object of the measure in\nSection 139AA\nconstitutes a\n\nlegitimate state aim, the decision of this Court in regard to the validity of\n\nAadhaar will impact upon the seeding of PAN with Aadhaar, which\nSection\n\n139AA\nseeks to achieve.\n\nH.7 Linking of SIM cards and Aadhaar numbers\n\n279 In\nAvishek Goenka v Union of India533\n, a three judge Bench of this\n\nCourt dealt with a public interest litigation seeking to highlight the non-\n\nobservance of norms, regulations and guidelines relating to subscriber\n\nverification by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs). The Department of\n\nTelecommunications (DoT), in the course of the proceedings, filed its\n\ninstructions stating its position in regard to the verification of prepaid and\n\npostpaid mobile subscribers. While concluding the proceedings, this Court\n\ndirected the constitution of an expert committee comprising of representatives\n\nof TRAI and DoT. The court mandated that the following issues should be\n\nexamined by the Committee:\n\n533 (2012) 5 SCC 275\nPART H\n\n“(a) Whether re-verification should be undertaken by the\nservice provider/licensee, DoT itself or any other central\nbody?\n\n(b) Is there any need for enhancing the penalty for\nviolating the instructions/guidelines including sale of pre-\nactivated SIM cards?\n\n(c) Whether delivery of SIM cards may be made by post?\nWhich is the best mode of delivery of SIM cards to provide\ndue verification of identity and address of a subscriber?\n\n(d) Which of the application forms i.e. the existing one or\nthe one now suggested by TRAI should be adopted as\nuniversal application form for purchase of a SIM card?\n\n(e) In absence of Unique ID card, whether updating of\nsubscriber details should be the burden of the licensee\npersonally or could it be permitted to be carried out through\nan authorised representative of the licensee?\n\n(f) In the interest of national security and the public\ninterest, whether the database of all registered subscribers\nshould be maintained by DoT or by the licensee and how\nsoon the same may be made accessible to the security\nagencies in accordance with law?”534\n\nIn pursuance of the above directive, DoT issued instructions on the verification\n\nof new mobile subscribers on 9 August 2012. On 6 January 2016, TRAI\n\naddressed a communication to DoT recommending that the new procedure for\n\nsubscriber verification was “cumbersome and resource intensive” and hence\n\nshould be replaced by an Aadhaar linked e-KYC mechanism. Following this,\n\nDoT issued a directive on 16 August 2016 to launch an Aadhaar e-KYC\n\nservice across all licenced service areas for issuance of mobile connections.\n\nHowever, it was stated that the e-KYC process was an alternative, in addition\n\nto the existing process of issuing mobile connections to subscribers and would\n\nnot be applicable for bulk, outstation and foreign customers.\n\n534 Ibid, at page 283\nPART H\n\n280 A public interest litigation was filed before this Court under\nArticle 32\nin\n\nLokniti Foundation v Union of India535\n. The relief which claimed was that\n\nthere should be a definite mobile phone subscriber verification to ensure a\n\nhundred per cent verification of subscribers. Responding to the petition, the\n\nUnion Government informed this Court that DoT had launched an Aadhaar\n\nbased e-KYC for issuing mobile connections on 16 August 2016, by which\n\ncustomers as well as point of sale agents of TSPs will be authenticated by\n\nUIDAI. A statement was made by the learned Attorney General that an\n\neffective programme for verification of prepaid connections would be devised\n\nwithin one year. In view of the statement of the AG, the petition was disposed\n\nof by a two judge Bench in terms of the following directions:\n\n“5. In view of the factual position brought to our notice during\nthe course of hearing, we are satisfied, that the prayers made\nin the writ petition have been substantially dealt with, and an\neffective process has been evolved to ensure identity\nverification, as well as, the addresses of all mobile phone\nsubscribers for new subscribers. In the near future, and more\nparticularly, within one year from today, a similar verification\nwill be completed, in the case of existing subscribers. While\ncomplimenting the petitioner for filing the instant petition, we\ndispose of the same with the hope and expectation, that the\nundertaking given to this Court, will be taken seriously, and\nwill be given effect to, as soon as possible.”536\n\nFollowing the decision, DoT issued a directive on 23 March 2017 to all\n\nlicensees stating that a way forward had been found to implement the\n\ndirections of the Supreme Court. Based on the hypothesis that this Court had\n\ndirected an E-KYC verification, DoT proceeded to implement it on 23 March\n\n2017.\n\n535 (2017) 7 SCC 155\n536 Ibid, at page 156\nPART H\n\n281 Mr Rakesh Dwivedi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nUIDAI and the State of Gujarat supported the measure. He submitted that the\n\nlicences of all TSPs are issued under\nSection 4\nof the Indian Telegraph Act\n\n1885. Since the Central Government has the exclusive privilege of\n\nestablishing, maintaining and working telegraphs, TSPs, it was urged, have to\n\noperate the telegraph under a license and the Central Government is entitled\n\nto impose conditions on the licensee. The instruction issued by DoT on 23\n\nMarch 2017 has, it is urged, the sanction of\nSection 4\nof the Indian Telegraph\n\nAct 1885.\n\n282 We must at the outset note the ambit of the proceedings before this\n\nCourt in Lokniti Foundation. In response to the public interest litigation, it\n\nwas the Union Government which relied on its decision of 16 August 2016 to\n\nimplement e-KYC verification for mobile subscribers. The petition was\n\ndisposed of since the prayers were substantially dealt with and the court\n\nperceived that an effective process had been adopted to ensure identity\n\nverification together with verification of addresses. Existing subscribers were\n\ndirected to be verified in a similar manner within one year. The issue as to\n\nwhether the seeding of Aadhaar with mobile SIM cards was constitutionally\n\nvalid did not fall for consideration.\n\n283 The decision to link Aadhaar numbers with SIM cards and to require e-\n\nKYC authentication of mobile subscribers has been looked upon by the Union\nPART H\n\ngovernment purely as a matter of efficiency of identification. TRAI’s letter\n\ndated 6 January 2016 states that the new procedure for subscriber verification\n\nwhich it had adopted was “cumbersome and resource intensive”. The issue as\n\nto whether Aadhaar linked e-KYC authentication would seriously compromise\n\nthe privacy of mobile subscribers did not enter into the decision making\n\ncalculus. In applying the test of proportionality, the matter has to be addressed\n\nnot just by determining as to whether a measure is efficient but whether it\n\nmeets the test of not being disproportionate or excessive to the legitimate aim\n\nwhich the state seeks to pursue. TRAI and DoT do have a legitimate concern\n\nover the existence of SIM cards obtained against identities which are not\n\ngenuine. But the real issue is whether the linking of Aadhaar cards is the least\n\nintrusive method of obviating the problems associated with subscriber\n\nverification. The state cannot be oblivious to the need to protect privacy and of\n\nthe dangers inherent in the utilization of the Aadhaar platform by telecom\n\nservice providers. In the absence of adequate safeguards, the biometric data\n\nof mobile subscribers can be seriously compromised and exploited for\n\ncommercial gain. While asserting the need for proper verification, the state\n\ncannot disregard the countervailing requirements of preserving the integrity of\n\nbiometric data and the privacy of mobile phone subscribers. Nor can we\n\naccept the argument that cell phone data is so universal that one can become\n\nblasé about the dangers inherent in the revealing of biometric information.\nPART H\n\n284 The submission that a direction of this nature could have been given to\n\nTSPs under\nSection 4\nof the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 does not answer the\n\nbasic issue of its constitutional validity, which turns upon the proportionality of\n\nthe measure. Having due regard to the test of proportionality which has been\n\npropounded in Puttaswamy and as elaborated in this judgment, we do not\n\nfind that the decision to link Aadhaar numbers with mobile SIM cards is valid\n\nor constitutional. The mere existence of a legitimate state aim will not justify\n\nthe means which are adopted. Ends do not justify means, at least as a matter\n\nof constitutional principle. For the means to be valid, they must be carefully\n\ntailored to achieve a legitimate state aim and should not be either\n\ndisproportionate or excessive in their encroachment on individual liberties.\n\n285 Mobile technology has become a ubiquitous feature of our age. Mobile\n\nphones are not just instruments to facilitate a telephone conversation. They\n\nare a storehouse of data reflecting upon personal preferences, lifestyles and\n\nindividual choices. They bear upon family life, the workplace and personal\n\nintimacies. The conflation of biometric data with SIM cards is replete with\n\ngrave dangers to personal autonomy. A constitution based on liberal values\n\ncannot countenance an encroachment of this nature. The decision to link\n\nAadhaar numbers to SIM cards and to enforce a regime of e-KYC\n\nauthentication clearly does not pass constitutional muster and must stand\n\ninvalidated. All TSPs shall be directed by the Union government and by TRAI\n\nto forthwith delete the biometric data and Aadhaar details of all subscribers\nPART I\n\nwithin two weeks. The above data and Aadhaar details shall not be used or\n\npurveyed by any TSP or any other person or agency on their behalf for any\n\npurpose whatsoever.\n\nI Money laundering rules\n\n286 Parliament enacted a law on money-laundering as part of a concerted\n\neffort by the international community to deal with activities which constitute a\n\nthreat to financial systems and to the integrity and sovereignty of nations. The\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the introduction of the Bill\n\ncontains an elucidation of the reasons for the enactment:\n\n“Introduction\nMoney-laundering poses a serious threat not only to the\nfinancial systems of countries, but also to their integrity and\nsovereignty. To obviate such threats international community\nhas taken some initiatives. It has been felt that to prevent\nmoney-laundering and connected activities a comprehensive\nlegislation is urgently needed. To achieve this objective the\nPrevention of Money-laundering Bill, 1998 was introduced in\nthe Parliament. The Bill was referred to the Standing\nCommittee on Finance, which presented its report on 4th\nMarch 1999 to the Lok Sabha. The Central Government\nbroadly accepted the recommendation of the Standing\nCommittee and incorporated them in the said Bill along with\nsome other desired changes.\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons\nIt is being realized, world over, that money-laundering poses\na serious threat not only to the financial systems of countries,\nbut also to their integrity and sovereignty. Some of the\ninitiatives taken by the international community to obviate\nsuch threat are outlined below:-\n\n(a) the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, to which\nIndia is a party, calls for prevention of laundering of\nproceeds of drug crimes and other connected activities\nand confiscation of proceeds derived from such offence.\n\n(b) the Basle Statement of Principles, enunciated in 1989,\noutlined basic policies and procedures that banks should\nPART I\n\nfollow in order to assist the law enforcement agencies in\ntackling the problem of money laundering.\n\n(c) the Financial Action Task Force established at the summit\nof seven major industrial nations, held in Paris from 14th\nto 16th July 1989, to examine the problem of money-\n\nlaundering has made forty recommendations, which\nprovide the foundation material for comprehensive\nlegislation to combat the problem of money-laundering.\nThe recommendations were classified under various\nheads. Some of the important heads are-\n\n(i) declaration of laundering of monies carried through\nserious crimes a criminal offence;\n\n(ii) to work out modalities of disclosure by financial\ninstitutions regarding reportable transactions;\n\n(iii) confiscation of the proceeds of crime;\n\n(iv) declaring money-laundering to be an extraditable\noffence; and\n\n(v) promoting international co-operation in\ninvestigation of money-laundering.\n\n(d) the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action\nadopted by United Nations General Assembly by its\nResolution No. S-17/2 of 23rd February 1990, inter alia,\ncalls upon the member States to develop mechanism to\nprevent financial institutions from being used for\nlaundering of drug related money and enactment of\nlegislation to prevent such laundering.\n\n(e) the United Nations in the Special Session on countering\nWorld Drug Problem Together concluded on the 8th to the\n10th June 1998 has made another declaration regarding\nthe need to combat money-laundering. India is a\nsignatory to this declaration.”\n\n287 The expressions “beneficial owner, reporting entity and intermediary”\n\nare defined respectively in clauses (fa), (wa) and (n) of the Act thus:\n\n“(fa) “beneficial owner” means an individual who ultimately\nowns or controls a client of a reporting entity or the person on\nwhose behalf a transaction is being conducted and includes a\nperson who exercises ultimate effective control over a\njuridical person.\n\n(wa) “reporting entity” means a banking company, financial\ninstitution, intermediary or a person carrying on a designated\nbusiness or profession.\n\n(n) “intermediary” means,-\n\n(i) a stock-broker, sub-broker share transfer agent, banker\nto an issue, trustee to a trust deed, registrar to an issue,\nPART I\n\nmerchant banker, underwriter, portfolio manager,\ninvestment adviser or any other intermediary associated\nwith securities market and registered under section 12 of\nthe Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15\nof 1992); or\n\n(ii) an association recognised or registered under the\nForward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952 (74 of 1952) or\nany member of such association; or\n\n(iii) intermediary registered by the Pension Fund\nRegulatory and Development Authority; or\n\n(iv) a recognised stock exchange referred to in clause (f) of\n\nsection 2\nof the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act,\n1956 (42 of 1956).”\n\nThe Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules 2005\n\nwere amended by the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of\n\nRecords) Second Amendment Rules 2017. By the amendment, several\n\ndefinitions were introduced with reference to the provisions of the Aadhaar\n\nAct. These are:\n\n“‘(aaa) “Aadhaar number” means an identification number as\ndefined under sub-section (a) of\nsection 2\nof the Aadhaar\n(Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits\nand Services) Act, 2016;\n\n(aab) “authentication” means the process as defined under\nsub-section (c) of\nsection 2\nof the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery\nof Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act,\n2016;\n\n(aac) “Resident” means an individual as defined under sub-\n\nsection (v) of\nsection 2\nof the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of\nFinancial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act,\n2016;\n\n(aad) “identity information” means the information as defined\nin sub-section (n) of\nsection 2\nof the Aadhaar (Targeted\nDelivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and\nServices) Act, 2016;\n\n(aae) “e – KYC authentication facility” means an\nauthentication facility as defined in Aadhaar (Authentication)\nRegulations, 2016;\n\n(aaf) “Yes/No authentication facility” means an authentication\nfacility as defined in Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations,\n2016…”\nPART I\n\nSimilarly, the expression “officially valid document” was amended to read as\n\nfollows:\n\n“(d) “officially valid document” means the passport, the\ndriving licence, the Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card,\nthe Voter’s Identity Card issued by [Election Commission of\nIndia, job card issued by NREGA duly signed by an officer of\nthe State Government, the letter issued by the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India containing details of name,\naddress and Aadhaar number or any other document as\nnotified by the Central Government in consultation with\nthe [Regulator]:\n\n[Provided that where simplified measures are applied for\nverifying the identity of the clients the following documents\nshall be deemed to be officially valid documents:-\n\n(a) identity card with applicant’s Photograph issued by the\nCentral/State Government Departments, Statutory/\nRegulatory Authorities, Public Sector Undertakings,\nScheduled Commercial Banks and Public Financial\nInstitutions;\n\n(b) letter issued by a gazette officer, with a duly attested\nphotograph of the person].”\n\n288 Rule 9 of the 2005 Rules requires every reporting entity to carry out\n\nclient due diligence at the time of the commencement of an account-based\n\nrelationship. Due diligence requires a verification of the identity of the client\n\nand a determination of whether the client is acting on behalf of a beneficial\n\nowner, who then has to be identified. Rule 9(3) defines the expression\n\n“beneficial owner” for the purpose of sub-rule 1. Rule 9(4) requires an\n\nindividual client to submit an Aadhaar number. Rule 9(3) and Rule 9(4) are\n\nextracted below:\n\n“9. Client Due Diligence.—(1) Every reporting entity shall—\nxxxxx\nxxxxx\n(3) The beneficial owner for the purpose of sub-rule (1) shall\nbe determined as under—\n\n(a) where the client is a company, the beneficial owner is\nthe natural person(s), who, whether acting alone or\nPART I\n\ntogether, or through one or more juridical person, has a\ncontrolling ownership interest or who exercises control\nthrough other means.\n\nExplanation.—For the purpose of this sub-clause-\n\n1. \"Controlling ownership interest\" means ownership\nof or entitlement to more than twenty-five per cent. of\nshares or capital or profits of the company;\n\n2. \"Control\" shall include the right to appoint majority\nof the directors or to control the management or\npolicy decisions including by virtue of their shareholding\nor management rights or shareholders agreements or\nvoting agreements;\n\n(b) where the client is a partnership firm, the beneficial\nowner is the natural person(s) who, whether acting alone or \\\ntogether, or through one or more juridical person, has I\nownership of/ entitlement to more than fifteen per cent. of\ncapital or profits of the partnership;\n\n(c) where the client is an unincorporated association or\nbody of individuals, the beneficial owner is the natural\nperson(s), who, whether acting alone or together, or through\none or more juridical person, has ownership of or entitlement\nto more than fifteen per cent. of the property or capital or\nprofits of such association or body of individuals;\n\n(d) where no natural person is identified under (a) or (b) or (c)\nabove, the beneficial owner is the relevant natural person\nwho holds the position of senior managing official;\n\n(e) where the client is a trust, the identification of beneficial\nowner(s) shall include identification of the author of the trust,\nthe trustee, the beneficiaries with fifteen per cent. or more\ninterest in the trust and any other natural person exercising\nultimate effective control over the trust through a chain of\ncontrol or ownership; and\n\n(f) where the client or the owner of the controlling interest\nis a company listed on a stock exchange, or is a subsidiary\nof such a company, it is not necessary to identify and verify\nthe identity of any shareholder or beneficial owner of such\ncompanies.\n\n(4) Where the client is an individual, who is eligible to be\nenrolled for an Aadhaar number, he shall for the purpose of\nsub-rule (1) submit to the reporting entity, -\n\n(a) the Aadhaar number issued by the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India; and\n\n(b) the Permanent Account Number or Form No. 60 as\ndefined in Income-tax Rules, 1962, and such other\ndocuments including in respect of the nature of business and\nfinancial status of the client as may be required by the\nreporting entity:\n\nProvided that where an Aadhaar number has not been\nassigned to a client, the client shall furnish proof of\napplication of enrolment for Aadhaar and in case the\nPART I\n\nPermanent Account Number is not submitted, one certified\ncopy of an 'officially valid document' shall be submitted.\nProvided further that photograph need not be submitted by a\nclient falling under clause (b) of sub-rule (1).”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nSub-rule 15 of Rule 9 requires the reporting entity to carry out authentication\n\nat the time of receipt of the Aadhaar number:\n\n“(15) Any reporting entity, at the time of receipt of the\nAadhaar number under provisions of this rule, shall carry out\nauthentication using either e-KYC authentication facility or\nYes/No authentication facility provided by Unique\nIdentification Authority of India.”\n\nSub-rule 17 allows a period of six months for a client who is eligible to be\n\nenrolled for Aadhaar and to obtain a PAN to submit it upon the\n\ncommencement of the account-based relationship. Failure to do so, would\n\nresult in the account ceasing to be operational until the Aadhaar number and\n\nPAN are submitted. Clauses a and c of sub-rule 17 provide as follows :\n\n“(17) (a) In case the client, eligible to be enrolled for Aadhaar\nand obtain a Permanent Account Number, referred to in sub-\nrules (4) to (9) of rule 9 does not submit the Aadhaar number\nor the Permanent Account Number at the time of\ncommencement of an account based relationship with a\nreporting entity, the client shall submit the same within a\nperiod of six months from the date of the commencement of\nthe account based relationship:\n\nProvided that the clients, eligible to be enrolled for Aadhaar\nand obtain the Permanent Account Number, already having\nan account based relationship with reporting entities prior to\ndate of this notification, the client shall submit the Aadhaar\nnumber and Permanent Account Number by 31st December,\n2017.\n\n(c) In case the client fails to submit the Aadhaar number and\nPermanent Account Number within the aforesaid six months\nperiod, the said account shall cease to be operational till the\ntime the Aadhaar number and Permanent Account Number is\nsubmitted by the client:\nPART I\n\nProvided that in case client already having an account based\nrelationship with reporting entities prior to date of this\nnotification fails to submit the Aadhaar number and\nPermanent Account Number by 31st December, 2017, the\nsaid account shall cease to be operational till the time the\nAadhaar number and Permanent Account Number is\nsubmitted by the client.”\n\n289 The statutory mandate for the framing these rules is contained in\n\nSections 12\n,\nand\nof the PMLA. Insofar as is material,\nSection 12\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n“12. Reporting entity to maintain records:-\n(1) Every reporting entity shall-\n\n(a) maintain a record of all transactions, including\ninformation relating to transactions covered under\nclause (b), in such manner as to enable it to\nreconstruct individual transactions;\n\n(b) furnish to the Director within such time as may be\nprescribed, information relating to such transactions,\nwhether attempted or executed, the nature and value\nof which may be prescribed;\n\n(c) verify the identity of its clients in such manner and\nsubject to such conditions, as may be prescribed;\n\n(d) identify the beneficial owner, if any, of such of its\nclients, as may be prescribed;\n\n(e) maintain record of documents evidencing identity\nof its clients and beneficial owners as well as\naccount files and business correspondence\nrelating to its clients.\n\n(2) Every information maintained, furnished or verified, save\nas otherwise provided under any law for the time being in\nforce, shall be kept confidential.\n\n(3) The records referred to in clause (a) of sub-section (1)\nshall be maintained for a period of five years from the date\nof transaction between a client and the reporting entity.\n(4) The records referred to in clause (e) of sub-section (1)\nshall be maintained for a period of five years after the\nbusiness relationship between a client and the reporting\nentity has ended or the account has been close, whichever\nis later.\n\n(5) The Central Government may, by notification, exempt any\nreporting entity or class of reporting entities from any\nobligation under this Chapter.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\nPART I\n\nSection 12\nimposes a statutory obligation on reporting entities to maintain\n\nrecords and to verify the identity of their clients and beneficial owners in the\n\nmanner prescribed. The procedure for and manner in which information is\n\nfurnished by reporting entities is specified under sub-\nsection 1\nof\nSection 12\n\nby the Central Government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nSection 15\nprovides as follows:\n\n“15. Procedure and manner of furnishing information by\nreporting entities:-\n\nThe Central Government may, in consultation with the\nReserve Bank of India, prescribe the procedure and the\nmanner of maintaining and furnishing information by a\nreporting entity under sub-section (1) of\nSection 12\nfor the\npurpose of implementing the provisions of this Act.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe rule making power is referable to the provisions of\nSection 73\n, which\n\ninsofar as is material, provides as follows:\n\n“73. Power to make rules-\n\n(1) The Central Government may, by notification, make rules\nfor carrying out the provisos of this Act.\n\n(2) In particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the\nforegoing power, such rules may provide for all or any of\nthe following matters, namely-\n\n(j) the manner and the conditions in which identity of\nclients shall be verified by the reporting entities under\nclause (c) of sub-section (1) of\nSection 12\n;\n(jj) the manner of identifying beneficial owner, if any, from\nthe clients by the reporting entities under clause (d) of\nsub-section (1) of\nSection 12\n;\n\n(k) the procedure and the manner of maintaining and\nfurnishing information under sub-section (1) of\nSection\nas required under\nSection 15\n;\n\n(x) any other matter which is required to be, or may be,\nprescribed.”\n\nSection 12(1)(c)\nrequires the reporting entity to verify the identity of its clients\n\n“in such manner and subject to such conditions” as may be prescribed. The\nPART I\n\nprovisions of the rules, including sub-rule 17(c) of Rule 9 have been\n\nchallenged on the ground that they suffer from the vice of excessive\n\ndelegation.\n\n290 In\nBombay Dyeing and Mfg v Bombay Environmental Action\n\nGroup537\n, this Court has re-affirmed the well-settled legal test which\n\ndetermines the validity of delegated legislation. The court held:\n\n“104…By reason of any legislation, whether enacted by the\nlegislature or by way of subordinate legislation, the State\ngives effect to its legislative policy. Such legislation, however,\nmust not be ultra vires the Constitution. A subordinate\nlegislation apart from being intra vires the Constitution, should\nnot also be ultra vires the parent Act under which it has been\nmade. A subordinate legislation, it is trite, must be reasonable\nand in consonance with the legislative policy as also give\neffect to the purport and object of the Act and in good faith.”\n\nThe essential legislative function consists in the determination of legislative\n\npolicy and of formally enacting it into a binding rule of conduct. Once this is\n\ncarried out by the legislature, ancillary or subordinate functions can be\n\ndelegated. Having laid down legislative policy, the legislation may confer\n\ndiscretion on the executive to work out the details in the exercise of the rule\n\nmaking power, though, in a manner consistent with the plenary enactment (\nJ\n\nK Industries Ltd v Union of India538\n).\n\n291 The Reserve Bank of India had issued a Master Circular dated 25\n\nFebruary 2016 in exercise of its statutory powers under\nSection 35A\nof the\n537 (2006) 3 SCC 434\n538 (2007) 13 SCC 673\nPART I\n\nBanking Regulation Act\n1949 (read with\nSection 56\n) and Rule 9(14) of the\n\nPrevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules 2005.\n\nFollowing the amendment of the PMLA Rules, the Master Circular of the\n\nReserve Bank has been updated on 20 April 2018.\n\nThe basic issue which needs to be addressed is whether the amendments\n\nwhich were brought about to the PMLA Rules in 2017 meet the test of\n\nproportionality.\n\n292 In 2005, the Central Government in consultation with the Reserve Bank\n\nof India notified the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of\n\nRecords) Rules 2005 under\nSection 73\nof the parent Act. The expression\n\n‘officially valid document’ was defined in Rule 2(d) in the following terms :\n\n“(d) “officially valid document” means the passport, the driving\nlicence, the Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card, the\nVoter’s Identity Card issued by539 [Election Commission of\nIndia, job card issued by NREGA duly signed by an officer of\nthe State Government, the letter issued by the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India540 [or the National Population\nRegister] containing details of name, address and Aadhaar\nnumber or any other document as notified by the Central\nGovernment in consultation with the [Regulator];”\n\nRule 9(4) required the submission to the reporting entity, where the client is an\n\nindividual, a certified copy of an officially valid document containing details of\n\nidentity and address. Rule 9(4) read as follows :\n\n“(4) Where the client is an individual, he shall for the purpose\nof sub-rule (1), submit to the reporting entity, one certified\n\n539 Substituted by G.S.R. 980(E), dated 16-12-2010 (w.e.f. 16-12-2010)\n540 Inserted by G.S.R. 544(E)\nPART I\n\ncopy of an “officially valid document” containing details of his\nidentity and address, one recent photograph and such other\ndocuments including in respect of the nature of business and\nfinancial status of the client as may be required by the\nreporting entity:”\n\nUnder Rule 9(14), the regulator was empowered to issue guidelines, in terms\n\nof the provisions of the rule, and to prescribe enhanced or simplified measures\n\nto verify the identity of a client, taking into consideration the type of client,\n\nbusiness relationship, and the nature and value of transactions based on the\n\noverall money-laundering and terrorist financing risks involved. Under the\n\nabove rules there were six ‘officially valid documents’ : the passport, driving\n\nlicence, Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card, NREGA job card, Voter’s\n\nIdentity Card and a letter of UIDAI containing details of name, address and\n\ndetails of Aadhaar number. or any other document notified by the Central\n\nGovernment in consultation with the Regulator.\n\n293 In the Master Circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India on 25\n\nFebruary 2016, a provision was made for the submission by customers, at\n\ntheir option, of one of the six officially valid documents (OVDs) for proof of\n\nidentity and address. Rule 3(vi) defined the expression ‘officially valid\n\ndocument’ in similar terms:\n\n“(vi) “officially valid document” means the passport, the\ndriving licence, the Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card,\nthe Voter’s Identity Card issued by the Election Commission\nof India, job card issued by NREGA duly signed by an officer\nof the State Government, letter issued by the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India containing details of name,\naddress and Aadhaar number.\nPART I\n\nExplanation: Customers, at their option, shall submit one of\nthe six OVDs for proof of identity and proof of address.”\n\nCustomer due diligence and on-going due diligence were defined thus:\n\n“Customer Due Diligence (CDD)” means indemnifying and\nverifying the customer and the beneficial owner using\n‘Officially Valid Documents’ as a ‘proof of identity’ and a ‘proof\nof address’.\n\n“On-going Due Diligence” means regular monitoring of\ntransactions in accounts to ensure that they are consistent\nwith the customers’ profile and source of funds.”\n\n294 Chapter III of the Master Circular provided for regulated entities\n\n(including banks) to specify a customer acceptance policy. Clause 15 of the\n\nMaster Circular inter alia specified that customers shall not be required to\n\nfurnish additional OVDs if the OVD already submitted, contained both proof of\n\nidentity and address. Chapter VI which provided for a due diligence procedure\n\nallowed customers to submit one of the six OVDs for proof of identity and\n\naddress. Under Part V of Chapter VI, banks were required to conduct on-\n\ngoing due diligence particularly in regard to large and complex transactions\n\nabove a threshold. Clause 39 of the Circular provided for a partial freezing and\n\nclosure of accounts:\n\n“39. Partial freezing and closure of accounts\n\n(a) Where REs are unable to comply with the CDD\nrequirements mentioned at Part I to V above, they shall\nnot open accounts, commence business relations or\nperform transactions. In case of existing business\nrelationship which is not KYC compliant, banks shall\nordinarily take step to terminate the existing business\nrelationship after giving due notice.\n\n(b) As an exception to the Rule, banks shall have an option\nto choose not to terminate business relationship straight\naway and instead opt for a phased closure of operations\nin this account as explained below:\nPART I\n\ni. The option of ‘partial freezing’ shall be exercise\nafter giving due notice of three months to the\ncustomers to comply with KYC requirements.\nii. A reminder giving a further period of three months\nshall also be given.\n\niii. Thereafter, ‘partial freezing’ shall be imposed by\nallowing credits and disallowing all debits with the\nfreedom to close the accounts in case of the\naccount being KYC non-compliant after six\nmonths of issue first notice.\n\niv. All debits and credits from/to the accounts shall be\ndisallowed, in case of the account being KYC non-\ncompliant after six months of imposing ‘partial\nfreezing’,\nv. The account holders shall have the option, to\nrevive their accounts by submitting the KYC\ndocuments.\n\n(c) When an account is closed whether without ‘partial\nfreezing’ or after ‘partial freezing’, the reason for that shall\nbe communicated to account holder.”\n\nChapter VIII provided for reporting requirements to the Financial Intelligence\n\nUnit. Chapter IX dealt with compliance with requirements/obligations under\n\ninternational agreements. Clause 58 of Chapter X stipulated reporting\n\nrequirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and\n\nCommon Reporting Standards (CRS).\n\n295 As a result of the amendment to the Rules brought about in 2017, Rule\n\n9(4) mandates that in the case of a client who is an individual, who is eligible\n\nto be enrolled for an Aadhaar number, submission of the Aadhaar number is\n\nmandatory. Instead of furnishing an option to submit one of six OVDs,\n\nsubmission of Aadhaar number alone is mandated. Where an Aadhaar\n\nnumber has not been assigned, proof of an application for enrolment is\n\nrequired to be submitted. Under Rule 9(15), the reporting entity at the time of\nPART I\n\nreceipt of an Aadhaar number is under an obligation to carry out\n\nauthentication using either the e-KYC authentication facility or the yes/no\n\nauthentication provided by UIDAI. If a client who is eligible to be enrolled for\n\nAadhaar and to obtain a PAN card does not submit its details while\n\ncommencing an account based relationship, there is a period of six months\n\nreserved for submission. Those who already have accounts are required to\n\nsubmit their Aadhaar numbers by a stipulated date. Failure to do so, renders\n\nthe account subject to the consequence that it shall cease to be operational\n\nuntil compliance is effected.\n\nFollowing the amendments to the rules, the Reserve Bank has updated its\n\nMaster Circular on 20 April 2018 to bring it into conformity with the amended\n\nrules.\n\n296 In deciding whether the amendment brought about in 2017 to the rules\n\nis valid, it is necessary to bear in mind what has already been set out earlier\n\non the aspect of proportionality. Does the requirement of the submission or\n\nlinking of an Aadhaar number to every account- based relationship satisfy the\n\ntest of proportionality?\n\nThe state has a legitimate aim in preventing money-laundering. In fact, it is\n\nwith a view to curb and deal with money-laundering that the original version of\n\nthe Master Circular as well as its updated version impose conditions for initial\nPART I\n\nand on-going due diligence. The Reserve Bank has introduced several\n\nreporting requirements including those required to comply with FATCA norms.\n\nThe existence of a legitimate state aim satisfies only one element of\n\nproportionality. In its submissions, the Union government has dealt only with\n\nlegitimate aim, leaving the other elements of proportionality unanswered.\n\nRequiring every client in an account based relationship to link the Aadhaar\n\nnumber with a bank account and to impose an authentication requirement, is\n\nexcessive to the aim and object of the state. There can be no presumption\n\nthat all existing account holders as well as every individual who seeks to open\n\nan account in future is a likely money-launderer. The type of client, the nature\n\nof the business relationship, the nature and value of the transactions and the\n\nterrorism and laundering risks involved may furnish a basis for distinguishing\n\nbetween cases and clients. The rules also fail to make a distinction between\n\nopening an account and operating an account. If an account has been opened\n\nin the past, it would be on the basis of an established identity. The\n\nconsequences of the non-submission of an Aadhaar number are draconian.\n\nNon-submission within the stipulated period will result in a consequence of the\n\naccount ceasing to be operational. A perfectly genuine customer who is\n\ninvolved in no wrongdoing would be deprived of the use of the moneys and\n\ninvestments reflected in the account, in violation of\nArticle 300A\nof the\n\nConstitution purely on an assumption that he or she has indulged in money-\n\nlaundering. The classification is over-inclusive: a uniform requirement of such\n\na nature cannot be imposed on every account based relationship irrespective\nPART I\n\nof the risks involved to the financial system. The account of a pensioner or of\n\na salaried wage earner cannot be termed with the same brush as a high net-\n\nworth individual with cross-border inflows and outflows. Treating every\n\naccount holder with a highly intrusive norm suffers from manifest arbitrariness.\n\nMoreover, there is no specific provision in the Act warranting a consequence\n\nof an account holder being deprived of the moneys standing in the account,\n\neven if for a temporary period.\nSection 12(1)(c)\nempowers a reporting entity\n\nto verify the entity or its client in such a manner and “subject to such\n\nconditions” as may be prescribed. This does not envisage a consequence of\n\nan account ceasing to be operational. Blocking an account is a deprivation of\n\nproperty under\nArticle 300A.\nThe Union Government has been unable to\n\ndischarge the burden of establishing that this was the least intrusive means of\n\nachieving its aim to prevent money-laundering or that its object would have\n\nbeen defeated if it were not to impose the requirement of a compulsory linking\n\nof Aadhaar numbers with all account based relationships with the reporting\n\nentity. Money-laundering is indeed a serious matter and the Union\n\nGovernment is entitled to take necessary steps including by classifying\n\ntransactions and sources which give rise to reasonable grounds for suspecting\n\na violation of law. But, to impose a uniform requirement of linking Aadhaar\n\nnumbers with all account based relationships is clearly disproportionate and\n\nexcessive. It fails to meet the test of proportionality and suffers from manifest\n\narbitrariness. While we have come to the above conclusion, we clarify that this\n\nwould not preclude the Union Government in the exercise of its rule making\nPART J\n\npower and the Reserve Bank of India as the regulator to re-design the\n\nrequirements in a manner that would ensure due fulfillment of the object of\n\npreventing money-laundering, subject to compliance with the principles of\n\nproportionality as outlined in this judgment.\n\nJ Savings in\nSection 59\nSection 59 of the Aadhaar Act provides:\n\n“Anything done or any action taken by the Central\nGovernment under the Resolution of the Government of India,\nPlanning Commission bearing notification number A-\n43011/02/2009-Admin. I, dated the 28th January, 2009, or by\nthe Department of Electronics and Information Technology\nunder the Cabinet Secretariat Notification bearing notification\nnumber S.O. 2492(E), dated the 12th September, 2015, as\nthe case may be, shall be deemed to have been validly done\nor taken under this Act.”\n\n298 The petitioners have submitted that all acts done pursuant to the\n\nNotifications dated 28 January 2009 and 12 September 2015, under which the\n\nAadhaar programme was created and implemented, violate fundamental\n\nrights and were not supported by the authority of law. It has been submitted\n\nthat the collection, storage and use of personal data by the State and private\n\nentities, which was done in a legislative vacuum as the State failed to enact\n\nthe Aadhaar Act for six years, is now being sought to be validated by Section\n\n59. It has been contended that since the acts done prior to the enactment of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act are in breach of fundamental rights,\nSection 59\nis invalid.\n\nMoreover,\nSection 59\ndoes not operate to validate the collection of biometric\n\ndata prior to the enforcement of the Aadhaar Act.\nPART J\n\nIt has been submitted that a validating law must remove the cause of invalidity\n\nof previous acts: it would not be effective if it simply deems a legal\n\nconsequence without amending the law from which the consequence could\n\nfollow. In the present case, it has been contended,\nSection 59\ndoes not create\n\na legal fiction where the Aadhaar Act is deemed to have been in existence\n\nsince 2009 and that it only declares a legal consequence of the acts done by\n\nthe Union since 2009.\n\nIt has also been submitted that\nSection 59\nis invalid and unconstitutional\n\ninasmuch as for Aadhaar enrolments done before 2016, there was neither\n\ninformed consent nor were any procedural guarantees and safeguards\n\nprovided under a legal framework.\nSection 59\n, it is contended, cannot cure the\n\nabsence of consent and other procedural safeguards, provided under the\n\nAadhaar Act, to the enrolments done prior to the enactment of the Act.\n\n299 The respondents have submitted that\nSection 59\nprotects the actions\n\ntaken by the Central government. It does not contemplate the maintenance of\n\nany data base, containing identity information, by the State governments. The\n\nState governments, it is urged, have destroyed the biometric data collected\n\nduring Aadhaar enrolments before the Act came into force, from their server.\n\nIt has been contended that\nSection 59\nis retrospective in nature as it states\n\nthat it shall operate from an earlier date.\nPART J\n\nThe Respondents have relied upon the judgments of this Court in West\n\nRamnad Electric Distribution Co. Ltd. v State of Madras541 (“West\n\nRamnad”),\nState of Mysore v D. Achiah Chetty\n, Etc542 (“Chetty”), and Hari\n\nSingh v Military Estate Officer543 (“Hari Singh”) to contend that the\n\nlegislature can, by retrospective operation, cure the invalidity of actions taken\n\nunder a law which is void for violating fundamental rights.\n\nIt has also been contended that before the advent of the Aadhaar Act, no\n\nindividual has been enrolled under compulsion, and since all enrolments were\n\nvoluntary, they cannot be considered to be in breach of\nArticle 21\nor any other\n\nfundamental right. It is further submitted that non-adjudication of the issue of\n\nwhether collection of identity information violates the right to privacy, does not\n\nprevent the Parliament from enacting a validating clause.\n\nReliance has also\n\nbeen placed on\nState of Karnataka v State of Tamil Nadu544\nto submit that\n\nSection 59\ncreates a deemed fiction as a result of which one has to imagine\n\nthat all actions taken under the notifications were taken under the Act.\nSection 7\nprovides that the Central Government or the State\n\nGovernments may require proof of an Aadhaar number as a necessary\n\ncondition for availing a subsidy, benefit or service for which the expenditure is\n\nincurred from the Consolidated Fund of India.\nSection 3\nprovides that the\n\nAadhaar number shall consist of demographic and biometric information of an\n541 (1963) 2 SCR 747\n542 (1969) 1 SCC 248\n543 (1972) 2 SCC 239\n544 (2017) 3 SCC 362\nPART J\n\nindividual. “Biometric information”, under\nSection 2(g)\n, means a photograph,\n\nfinger print, Iris scan, or such other biological attributes of an individual as\n\nmay be specified by regulations.\nSection 4(3)\nprovides that an Aadhaar\n\nnumber may be used as a proof of identity “for any purpose”.\nSection 57\n\nauthorizes a body corporate or person to use the Aadhaar number for\n\nestablishing the identity of an individual “for any purpose”. The proviso to\n\nSection 57\nprovides that the use of an Aadhaar number under the Section\n\nshall be subject to the procedure and obligations under\nSection 8\nand\nChapter\n\nVI of the Act\n.\nSection 8\nsets out the procedure for authentication. It states that\n\nfor authentication, a requesting entity shall obtain the consent of an individual\n\nbefore collecting identity information and shall ensure that the identity\n\ninformation is only used for submission to the Central Identities Data\n\nRepository for authentication. It does not envisage collection of identity\n\ninformation for any other purpose.\nChapter VI of the Act\n, which deals with\n\nprotection of information, provides for security and confidentiality of identity\n\ninformation collected under the Act, imposes restrictions on sharing that\n\ninformation and classifies biometrics as sensitive personal information.\n\n301 The scheme of the Aadhaar Act creates a system of identification\n\nthrough authentication of biometric information and authorises the Central and\n\nState governments to assign the task of collecting individual biometric\n\ninformation for the purpose of generation of Aadhaar numbers to private\n\nentities.\nThe Act\nauthorises the use of Aadhaar numbers by the Central\nPART J\n\ngovernment, state governments and the private entities for establishing the\n\nidentity of a resident for any purpose.\nThe Act\nalso contains certain\n\nsafeguards regarding storage and use of biometric information. The actions\n\ntaken before the enactment of the Aadhaar Act have to be tested upon the\n\ntouchstone of the legal framework provided under the Act.\nSection 59\nis a validating provision. It seeks to validate all the actions of\n\nthe Central Government prior to the Aadhaar Act, which were done under the\n\nnotifications of 28 January 2009 and 12 September 2015.\nSection 59\ndoes not\n\nvalidate actions of the state governments or of private entities. Acts\n\nundertaken by the State governments and by private entities are not saved by\n\nSection 59\n.\n\n303 The Planning Commission’s notification dated 28 January 2009 created\n\nUIDAI, while giving it the responsibility of laying down a plan and policies to\n\nimplement a unique identity (UID) scheme. UIDAI was only authorized to own\n\nand operate the UID database, with a further responsibility for the updation\n\nand maintenance of the database on an ongoing basis. Significantly, the 2009\n\nnotification did not contain any reference to the use of biometrics for the\n\npurpose of the generation of Aadhaar numbers. The notification gave no\n\nauthority to collect biometrics. Biometrics, finger prints or iris scans were not\n\nwithin its purview. There was no mention of the safeguards and measures\n\nrelating to the persons or entities who would collect biometric data, how the\nPART J\n\ndata would be collected and how it would be used. The website of the Press\n\nInformation Bureau of the Government of India states that, by the time\n\nAadhaar Act was notified by the Central government, UIDAI had generated\n\nabout 100 crore Aadhaar numbers.545 The collection of biometrics from\n\nindividuals prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act does not fall within the\n\nscope of the 2009 notification. Having failed to specify finger prints and iris\n\nscans in the notification, the validating provision does not extend to the\n\ncollection of biometric data before the Act. The 2009 notification did not\n\nprovide authority to any government department or to any entity to collect\n\nbiometrics. Since the collection of biometrics was not authorised by the 2009\n\nnotification, Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act does not validate these actions.\n\n304 The collection of the biometrics of individuals impacts their privacy and\n\ndignity.\nInformed consent is crucial to the validity of a state mandated\n\nmeasure to collect biometric data. Encroachment on a fundamental right\n\nrequires the enacting of a valid law by the legislature.546 The law will be valid\n\nonly if it meets the requirements of permissible restrictions relating to each of\n\nthe fundamental rights on which there is an encroachment. Privacy animates\n\nPart III of the Constitution.547 The invasion of any right flowing from privacy\n\nplaces a heavy onus upon the State to justify its actions. Nine judges of this\n\n545Press Information Bureau, UIDAI generates a billion (100 crore) Aadhaars A Historic Moment for India,\navailable at http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=138555\n546A Constitution Bench of this Court in\nState of Madhya Pradesh v. Thakur Bharat Singh\n(AIR 1967 SC 1170)\n\nheld: “All executive action which operates to the prejudice of any person must have the authority of law to\nsupport it… Every Act done by the Government or by its officers must, if it is to operate to the prejudice of any\nperson, be supported by some legislative authority.”\n547Puttaswamy, at para 272\nPART J\n\nCourt in Puttaswamy categorically held that there must be a valid law in\n\nexistence to encroach upon the right to privacy. An executive notification does\n\nnot satisfy the requirement of a valid law contemplated in Puttaswamy. A\n\nvalid law, in this case, would mean a law enacted by Parliament, which is just,\n\nfair and reasonable. Any encroachment upon the fundamental right to privacy\n\ncannot be sustained by an executive notification.\n\nThere is also no merit in the submission of the Respondents that prior to the\n\nenactment of the Aadhaar Act, no individual has been enrolled under\n\ncompulsion, and since all enrolments were voluntary, these cannot be\n\nconsidered to be in breach of\nArticle 21\nor any other fundamental right. The\n\nformat of the first two enrolment forms used by UIDAI, under which around 90\n\ncrore enrolments were done, had no mention of informed consent or the use\n\nof biometrics. Hence, this submission is rejected.\n\nApart from the existence of a valid law which authorises an invasion of\n\nprivacy, Puttaswamy requires that the law must have adequate safeguards\n\nfor the collection and storage of personal data. Data protection, which is\n\nintrinsic to privacy, seeks to protect the autonomy of the individual. The\n\njudgment noted the centrality of consent in a data protection regime. The\n\nAadhaar Act provides certain safeguards in\nSection 3(2)\nand\nSection 8(3)\nfor\n\nthe purposes of ensuring informed consent, and in terms of\nSection 29\nread\n\nwith Chapter VII in the form of penalties. The safeguards provided under the\nPART J\n\nAct\nwere not in existence before the enactment of the Act. The collection of\n\nbiometrics after the 2009 notification and prior to the Aadhaar Act suffers from\n\nthe absence of adequate safeguards. While a legislature has the power to\n\nlegislate retrospectively, it cannot retrospectively create a deeming fiction\n\nabout the existence of safeguards in the past to justify an encroachment on a\n\nfundamental right. At the time when the enrolments took place prior to the\n\nenactment of the Aadhaar Act in September 2016, there was an absence of\n\nadequate safeguards.\nSection 59\ncannot by a deeming fiction, as it were,\n\nextend the safeguards provided under the Act to the enrolments done earlier.\n\nThis will be impermissible simply because the informed consent of those\n\nindividuals, whose Aadhaar numbers were generated in that period cannot be\n\nretrospectively legislated by an assumption of law. Moreover, it is a principle\n\nof criminal law that it cannot be applied retrospectively to acts which were not\n\noffences at the time when they took place.\nArticle 20(1)\nof the Constitution\n\nprovides that “No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation\n\nof the law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an\n\noffence”. The application of the criminal provisions of the Act, provided under\n\nChapter VII of the Act\nwhich deals with “Offences and Penalties”, cannot be\n\nextended to the period prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act.\n\n305 The Respondents submit that the collection of biometrics prior to the\n\nAadhaar Act was adequately safeguarded by the provisions of the Information\nPART J\n\nTechnology Act\n2000; specifically those provisions, which were inserted or\n\namended by the\nInformation Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008\n.\n\nSection 43A\nof the Act provides for compensation for failure to protect data:\n\n“Where a body corporate, possessing, dealing or handling\nany sensitive personal data or information in a computer\nresource which it owns, controls or operates, is negligent in\nimplementing and maintaining reasonable security practices\nand procedures and thereby causes wrongful loss or wrongful\ngain to any person, such body corporate shall be liable to pay\ndamages by way of compensation to the person so affected.\n\nExplanation: For the purposes of this section,-\n\n(i) “body corporate” means any company and includes a firm,\nsole proprietorship or other association of individuals\nengaged in commercial or professional activities;\n\n(ii) “reasonable security practices and procedures” means\nsecurity practices and procedures designed to protect such\ninformation from unauthorised access, damage, use,\nmodification, disclosure or impairment, as may be specified in\nan agreement between the parties or as may be specified in\nany law for the time being in force and in the absence of such\nagreement or any law, such reasonable security practices\nand procedures, as may be prescribed by the Central\nGovernment in consultation with such professional bodies or\nassociations as it may deem fit.\n\n(iii) “sensitive personal data or information” means such\npersonal information as may be prescribed by the Central\nGovernment in consultation with such professional\nbodies or associations as it may deem fit.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n306 Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices\n\nand Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011\n\nmade by the Central government under\nSection 43A\n, defines “sensitive\n\npersonal data or information”:\n\n“Sensitive personal data or information of a person means\nsuch personal information which consists of information\nrelating to;—\n\n(i) password;\nPART J\n\n(ii) financial information such as Bank account or credit\ncard or debit card or other payment instrument details ;\n\n(iii) physical, physiological and mental health condition;\n\n(iv) sexual orientation;\n(v) medical records and history;\n(vi) Biometric information;\n\n(vii) any detail relating to the above clauses as provided to\nbody corporate for providing service; and\n\n(viii) any of the information received under above clauses\nby body corporate for processing, stored or processed under\nlawful contract or otherwise.\n\nProvided that, any information that is freely available or\naccessible in public domain or furnished under the\nRight to\nInformation Act, 2005\nor any other law for the time being in\nforce shall not be regarded as sensitive personal data or\ninformation for the purposes of these rules.”\n\nSection 66C provides a punishment for identity theft:\n\n“66C. Punishment for identity theft.-\n\nWhoever, fraudulently548 or dishonestly549 make use of the\nelectronic signature, password or any other unique\nidentification feature of any other person, shall be punished\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may\nextend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which\nmay extend to rupees one lakh.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nSection 66E provides for punishment for the violation of the privacy of an\n\nindividual:\n\n“Whoever, intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes or\ntransmits the image of a private area of any person without\nhis or her consent, under circumstances violating the privacy\nof that person, shall be punished with imprisonment which\nmay extend to three years or with fine not exceeding two lakh\nrupees, or with both.”\n\nThe explanation to the Section provides that “transmit” means to electronically\n\nsend a visual image with the intent that it be viewed by a person or persons.\n\n548Section 25,\nIndian Penal Code\nstates: ““Fraudulently”.—A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does\nthat thing with intent to defraud but not otherwise”\n549Section 24,\nIndian Penal Code\nstates: ““Dishonestly”- Whoever does anything with the intention of causing\n\nwrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing “dishonestly”\nPART J\n\n“Capture”, with respect to an image, has been defined to mean videotaping,\n\nphotographing, filming or recording by any means. “Private area” means the\n\n“naked or undergarment clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast.”\n\n“Publishes” has been defined as reproduction in the printed or electronic form\n\nand making it available for public.\n\nSection 72A\nprovides for punishment for disclosure of information in breach of\n\na lawful contract:\n\n“Save as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for\nthe time being in force, any person including an intermediary\nwho, while providing services under the terms of lawful\ncontract, has secured access to any material containing\npersonal information about another person, with the intent to\ncause or knowing that he is likely to cause wrongful loss or\nwrongful gain discloses, without the consent of the person\nconcerned, or in breach of a lawful contract, such material to\nany other person shall be punished with imprisonment for a\nterm which may extend to three years, or with a fine which\nmay extend to five lakh rupees, or with both.” (Emphasis\nsupplied)\n\nSection 43A\napplies only to bodies corporate and has no application to\n\ngovernment or to its departments. Explanation (i) defines body corporate to\n\nmean any company and to include a firm, sole proprietorship or other\n\nassociation of individuals engaged in professional or commercial activities.\n\nPersonal information leaked or lost by government agencies will not be\n\ncovered under\nSection 43A\n. The scope of Section 66E is limited. It only deals\n\nwith the privacy of the “private area” of any person. It does not deal with\n\ninformational privacy. The scope of\nSection 72A\nis also limited. It only\n\npenalises acts of disclosing personal information about a person obtained\nPART J\n\nwhile providing services under a lawful contract. Section 66C deals with\n\nidentity theft and punishes the dishonest or fraudulent use of the unique\n\nidentification feature of a person.\nThe Information Technology Act\nalso does\n\nnot penalise unauthorised access to the Central Identities Data Repository.\n\nMany of the safeguards which were introduced by the Aadhaar Act were not\n\ncomprehended in the provisions of the\nInformation Technology Act\n. Indeed, it\n\nwas the absence of those safeguards in the\nInformation Technology Act\nwhich\n\nrequired their introduction in the Aadhaar Act. Hence, the Attorney General is\n\nnot correct in submitting that India operated under a regime of comprehensive\n\nsafeguards governing biometric data during the period when the Aadhaar\n\nproject was governed by an executive notification, in the absence of a\n\nlegislative framework. The absence of a legislative framework rendered the\n\ncollection of biometric data vulnerable to serious violations of privacy. There\n\nare two distinct facets here. First, the absence of a legislative framework for\n\nthe Aadhaar project between 2009 and 2016 left the biometric data of millions\n\nof Indian citizens bereft of the kind of protection which a law, as envisaged in\n\nPuttaswamy, must provide to comprehensively protect and enforce the right\n\nto privacy. Second, the notification of 2009 does not authorise the collection of\n\nbiometric data. Consequently, the validation of actions taken under the 2009\n\nnotification by\nSection 59\ndoes not save the collection of biometric data prior\n\nto the enforcement of the Act. Privacy is of paramount importance. No\n\ninvasion of privacy can be allowed without proper, adequate and stringent\nPART J\n\nsafeguards providing not only penalties for misuse or loss of one’s personal\n\ninformation, but also for protection of that person.\n\n307 The Respondents have relied upon several judgments where this Court\n\nhas upheld validating statutes, which, they contend, are similar to\nSection 59\n.\n\nThe first decision which needs to be discussed is the judgment of the\n\nConstitution Bench in West Ramnad, which dealt with a validating statute of\n\nthe Madras Legislature. Act 43 of 1949 of the Madras Legislature which\n\nsought to acquire electricity undertakings in the state was struck down for\n\nwant of legislative competence. In the meantime, the Constitution came into\n\nforce, and under the Seventh Schedule, the State acquired legislative\n\ncompetence. A fresh law was enacted in 1954.\nSection 24\nsought to validate\n\nactions done and taken under the 1949 Act.\nSection 24\nprovided thus:\n\n“Orders made, decisions or directions given, notifications\nissued, proceedings taken and acts or things done, in relation\nto any undertaking taken over, if they would have been\nvalidly made, given, issued, taken or done, had the\nMadras Electricity Supply Undertakings (Acquisition) Act\n1949 (Madras Act 43 of 1949), and the rules made\nthereunder been in force on the date on which the said\norders, decisions or directions, notifications, proceeding, acts\nor things were made, given, issued, taken or done are hereby\ndeclared to have been validly made, given, issued, taken\nor done, as the case may be, except to the extent to\nwhich the said orders, decisions, directions,\nnotifications, proceedings, acts or things are repugnant\nto the provisions of this Act.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nSection 24\nwas held to be a provision, which saved and validated actions\n\nvalidly taken under the provisions of the earlier Act, which was invalid from the\nPART J\n\ninception. Justice Gajendragadkar, speaking for the Court, interpreted\nSection\nthus:\n\n“12. The first part of the section deals, inter alia, with\nnotifications which have been validly issued under the\nrelevant provisions of the earlier Act and it means that if\nthe earlier Act had been valid at the relevant time, it ought to\nappear that the notifications in question could have been and\nhad in fact been made properly under the said Act. In other\nwords, before any notification can claim the benefit of\n\nSection 24\n, it must be shown that it was issued properly\nunder the relevant provisions of the earlier Act, assuming\nthat the said provisions were themselves valid and in\nforce at that time. The second part of the section provides\nthat the notifications covered by the first part are declared by\nthis Act to have been validly issued; the expression “hereby\ndeclared” clearly means “declared by this Act” and that shows\nthat the notifications covered by the first part would be treated\nas issued under the relevant provisions of the Act and would\nbe treated as validly issued under the said provisions. The\nthird part of the section provides that the statutory declaration\nabout the validity of the issue of the notification would be\nsubject to this exception that the said notification should not\nbe inconsistent with or repugnant to the provisions of the Act.\nIn other words, the effect of this section is that if a\nnotification had been issued properly under the\nprovisions of the earlier Act and its validity could not\nhave been impeached if the said provisions were\nthemselves valid, it would be deemed to have been\nvalidly issued under the provisions of the Act, provided,\nof course, it is not inconsistent with the other provisions\nof the Act. The section is not very happily worded, but on its\nfair and reasonable construction, there can be no doubt about\nits meaning or effect.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n308 The second decision is a four judge Bench judgment in Chetty, which\n\ndealt with the competence of a legislature to remedy a discriminatory\n\nprocedure retrospectively. There were two Acts in Mysore for acquisition of\n\nprivate land for public purposes − the\nMysore Land Acquisition Act, 1894\nand\n\nthe City of Bangalore Improvement Act, 1945. The respondent challenged a\n\nnotification which was issued under the 1894 Act for the acquisition of his land\nPART J\n\nin Bangalore, on the ground that recourse to the provisions of the\nLand\n\nAcquisition Act\nwas discriminatory because in other cases the provisions of\n\nthe Improvement Act were applied. The High Court accepted the contention,\n\nagainst which there was an appeal to this Court. During the pendency of the\n\nappeal, the Bangalore Acquisition of Lands (Validation) Act, 1962 was\n\npassed. The 1962 Act contained two provisions.\nSection 2\nprovided:\n\n“2. Validation of certain acquisition of lands and proceedings\nand orders connected therewith.-\n\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the City of\nBangalore Improvement Act, 1945 (Mysore Act 5 of 1945),\nor in any other law, or in any judgment, decree or order of\nany court:\n\n(a) every acquisition of land for the purpose of\nimprovement, expansion or development of the City of\nBangalore or any area to which the City of Bangalore\nImprovement Act, 1945, extends, made by the State\nGovernment acting or purporting to act under the\n\nMysore Land Acquisition Act, 1894\n(Mysore Act 7 of\n1894), at any time before the commencement of this\nAct, and every proceeding held, notification issued and\norder made in connection with the acquisition of land for\nthe said purpose shall be deemed for all purposes to\nhave been validly made, held to issue, as the case\nmay be, and any acquisition proceeding\ncommenced under the\nMysore Land Acquisition\nAct, 1894\n, for the said purpose before the\ncommencement of this Act but not concluded before\nsuch commencement, may be continued under the\n\nLand Acquisition Act, 1894\n(Central Act 1 of 1894), as\nextended to the State of Mysore by the Land Acquisition\n(Mysore Extension and Amendment) Act, 1961, and\naccordingly no acquisition so made, no proceeding\nheld, no notification issued and no order made by the\nState Government or by any authority under the\nMysore\nLand Acquisition Act, 1894\n, or the\nLand Acquisition Act,\n, in connection with any such acquisition shall be\ncalled in question on the ground that the State\nGovernment was not competent to make acquisition of\nland for the said purpose under the said Act or on any\nother ground whatsoever;\n\n(b) any land to the acquisition of which the provisions of\nclause (a) are applicable shall, after it has vested in the\nState Government, be deemed to have been\nPART J\n\ntransferred, or stand transferred, as the case may be, to\nthe Board of Trustees for the improvement of the City of\nBangalore.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Act\nof 1962 validated all acquisitions made, proceedings held,\n\nnotifications issued or orders made under the Mysore Land Acquisition Act\n\nbefore the validating law came into force. The Validation Act was challenged\n\non the ground that it was discriminatory to provide two Acts which prescribed\n\ntwo different procedures under the acquisition laws in the same field. This\n\nCourt found that the legislature retrospectively made a single law for the\n\nacquisition of properties and upheld the validating Act. It was held:\n\n“15. If two procedures exist and one is followed and the other\ndiscarded, there may in a given case be found discrimination.\nBut the Legislature has still the competence to put out of\naction retrospectively one of the procedures leaving one\nprocedure only available, namely, the one followed and thus\nto make disappear the discrimination. In this way a Validating\nAct can get over discrimination. Where, however, the\nlegislative competence is not available, the discrimination\nmust remain for ever, since that discrimination can only be\nremoved by a legislature having power to create a single\nprocedure out of two and not by a legislature which has not\nthat power.”\n\n309 In West Ramnad, the validation depended upon the condition that a\n\nnotification or act ought to have been validly issued or done under the earlier\n\nstatute, presuming that the earlier Act was itself valid at that time. In the\n\npresent case, there was no earlier law governing the actions of the\n\ngovernment for the collection of biometric data. The Aadhaar Act was notified\n\nin 2016. The Planning Commission’s notification of 2009 and the Ministry of\n\nInformation and Technology’s notification of 2015 were not issued under any\nPART J\n\nstatute. Therefore, the validating law in West Ramnad was clearly of a\n\ndistinct genre. West Ramnad will be of no assistance to the Union of India.\n\n310 The decision in Chetty in fact brings out the essential attributes of a\n\nvalidating law. The existence of two legislations governing the field of land\n\nacquisition had been found to be discriminatory and hence violative of\nArticle\nby the High Court (on the basis of the position in law as it then stood).\n\nDuring the pendency of the appeal before this Court, the legislature enacted a\n\nvalidating law which removed the cause for invalidity. The reason the state\n\nlaw had been invalidated by the High Court was the existence of two laws\n\ngoverning the same field. This defect was removed. To use the words of this\n\nCourt, the legislature “put out of action retrospectively one of the procedures”\n\nas a result of which only one procedure was left in the field. The decision in\n\nChetty thus brings out the true nature of a validating law. A validating law\n\nessentially removes the deficiency which is found to exist in the earlier\n\nenactment. By curing the defect, it validates actions taken under a previous\n\nenactment.\n\n311 The third judgment of seven judges is in Hari Singh. The\n\nconstitutionality of the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants)\n\nAct, 1958\nwas challenged on the ground that\nSection 5(1)\ncontravened Article\n\n14.\nSection 5(1)\nconferred power on the Estate Officer to make an order of\n\neviction against persons who were in unauthorised occupation of public\nPART J\n\npremises. During the pendency of the appeal before this\nCourt, the Public\n\nPremises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971\nwas enacted, which\n\nvalidated all actions taken under the Act of 1958. The constitutional validity of\n\nthe 1971 Act was also challenged.\nSection 20\nof the later Act provided:\n\n“Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court,\nanything done or any action taken (including rules or\norders made, notices issued, evictions ordered or effected,\ndamages assessed, rents or damages or costs recovered and\nproceedings initiated) or purported to have been done or\ntaken under the\nPublic Premises (Eviction of\nUnauthorised Occupants) Act, 1958\nshall be deemed to\nbe as valid and effective as if such thing or action was\ndone or taken under the corresponding provisions of this\nAct which, under Sub-section (3) of\nSection 1\nshall be\ndeemed to have come into force on the 16th day of\nSeptember, 1958 ...” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Court held that the legislature has the power to validate actions under an\n\nearlier law by removing its infirmities. In that case, validation was achieved by\n\nenacting the 1971 Act with retrospective effect from 1958 and legislating that\n\nactions taken under the earlier law will be deemed to be as valid and effective\n\nas if they were taken under the 1971 Act. The Court held:\n\n“24. The 1958 Act has not been declared by this Court to be\nunconstitutional… The arguments on behalf of the appellants\ntherefore proceeded on the footing that the 1958 Act will be\npresumed to be unconstitutional. It was therefore said that the\n1971 Act could not validate actions done under the 1958 Act.\nThe answer is for the reasons indicated above that the\nLegislature was competent to enact this legislation in 1958\nand the Legislature by the 1971 Act has given the legislation\nfull retrospective operation. The Legislature has power to\nvalidate actions under an earlier Act by removing the\ninfirmities of the earlier Act. The 1971 Act has achieved that\nobject of validation.”\nPART J\n\nThe Court approved the Constitution Bench decision in West Ramnad:\n\n“16. The ruling of this Court in\nWest Ramnad Electric\nDistribution Co. Ltd.\ncase establishes competence of the\nlegislature to make laws retrospective in operation for the\npurpose of validation of action done under an earlier Act\nwhich has been declared by a decision of the court to be\ninvalid. It is to be appreciated that the validation is by virtue of\nthe provisions of the subsequent piece of legislation.”\n\nIn Hari Singh, the validating Act retrospectively authorised the actions\n\nundertaken under the previous Act, which had been invalidated by a court\n\ndecision. The validating law of 1971 was enacted with retrospective effect\n\nfrom 1958.\n\n312 Reliance was placed by the Respondents on the judgments of this\n\nCourt in Jaora Sugar Mills (P) Ltd. v State of Madhya Pradesh550 (Jaora\n\nSugar Mills), SKG Sugar Ltd. v State of Bihar551 (“SKG Sugar”) and\n\nKrishna Chandra Gangopadhyaya v Union of India552 (“Krishna\n\nChandra”), to contend that in the case of fiscal legislation, where an\n\nenactment was struck down for violating\nArticle 265\nor the fundamental\n\nrights, of a citizen, validating Acts were enacted after removing the flaw and\n\nthat in cases where the state Legislature was held to be incompetent to enact\n\na taxing measure, a validating law was enacted by Parliament by making a\n\nsubstantive provision.\n\n550 (1966) 1 SCR 523\n551 (1974) 4 SCC 827\n552 (1975) 2 SCC 302\nPART J\n\n313 In Jaora Sugar Mills, a state law imposing cess was struck down for\n\nwant of legislative competence. Parliament enacted the\nSugarcane Cess\n\n(Validation) Act, 1961\nto validate the imposition of cess under the invalidated\n\nstate law.\nSection 3(1)\nof the 1961 Act provided:\n\n“12…Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any\nCourt, all cesses imposed, assessed or collected or\npurporting to have been imposed, assessed or collected\nunder any State Act before the commencement of this act\nshall be deemed to have been validly imposed, assessed\nor collected in accordance with law, as if the provisions of\nthe State Acts and of all notifications, orders and rules\nissued or made thereunder, in so far as such provisions relate\nto the imposition, assessment and collection of such cess had\nbeen included in and formed part of this section and this\nsection had been in force at all material times when such\ncess was imposed, assessed or collected; ….”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Section was upheld. Speaking for the Constitution Bench, Chief Justice\n\nGajendragadkar held:\n\n“14... What Parliament has done by enacting the said section\nis not to validate the invalid State Statutes, but to make a law\nconcerning the cess covered by the said Statutes and to\nprovide that the said law shall come into operation\nretrospectively. There is a radical difference between the\ntwo positions. Where the legislature wants to validate an\nearlier Act which has been declared to be invalid for one\nreason or another, it proceeds to remove the infirmity from the\nsaid Act and validates its provisions which are free from any\ninfirmity.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe state law was held to be invalid for want of legislative competence.\n\nParliament, which was competent to enact a law on the subject, did so with\n\nretrospective effect and validated actions which were taken under the invalid\n\nstate law.\nPART J\n\n314 In SKG Sugar, a state law - Bihar Sugar Factories Control Act, 1937 -\n\nwas declared unconstitutional. In 1969, during President's Rule in Bihar,\n\nParliament enacted the\nBihar Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and\n\nPurchase) Act, 1969\n.\nSection 66(1)\nof the Act provided:\n\n“12…Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any\ncourt, all cesses and taxes imposed, assessed or collected\nor purporting to have been imposed, assessed or collected\nunder any State law, before the commencement of this Act,\nshall be deemed to have been validly imposed, assessed\nor collected in accordance with law as if this Act had been\nin force at all material times when such cess or tax was\nimposed, assessed or collected and accordingly....” 553\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Constitution Bench held:\n\n“32… By virtue of the legal fiction introduced by the validating\nprovision in\nSection 66(1)\n, the impugned notification will be\ndeemed to have been issued not necessarily under the\nOrdinance No. 3 of 1968 but under the President's Act, itself,\nderiving its legal force and validity directly from the latter.”554\n\n315 In Krishna Chandra, provisions of the\nBihar Land Reforms Act, 1950\n\nwere struck down for want of legislative competence. Parliament enacted the\n\nMines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957\nto validate those\n\nprovisions with retrospective effect.\nSection 2\nprovided that:\n\n“1…(2). Validation of certain Bihar State laws and action\ntaken and things done connected therewith.-\n\n(1) The laws specified in the schedule shall be and shall\nbe deemed always to have been, as valid as if the\nprovisions contained therein had been enacted by\nParliament.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any\ncourt, all actions taken, things done, rules made,\nnotifications issued or purported to have been taken, done,\n\n553 Ibid, at page 831\n554 Ibid, at page 835\nPART J\n\nmade or issued and rents or royalties realised under any\nsuch laws shall be deemed to have been validly taken,\ndone, made, issued or realised, as the case may be, as if this\nsection had been in force at all material times when such\naction was taken, things were done, rules were, made,\nnotifications were issued, or rents or royalties were realised,\nand no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or\ncontinued in any court for the refund of rents or royalties\nrealised under any such laws.\n\n(3) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that\nnothing in Sub-section (2) shall be construed as preventing\nany person from claiming refund of any rents or royalties paid\nby him in excess of the amount due from him under any such\nlaws.”555 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe central issue in the case was whether a statute and a rule earlier\n\ndeclared to be unconstitutional or invalid, can be retroactively enacted through\n\nfresh validating legislation by the competent Legislature. The Court held that it\n\ncould be.\n\n316 Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act is different from the validating provisions\n\nin Jaora Sugar Mills, SKG Sugar and Krishna Chandra. In those cases,\n\nstate laws were invalid for want of legislative competence. Parliament, which\n\nundoubtedly possessed legislative competence, could enact a fresh law with\n\nretrospective effect and protect actions taken under the state law. The\n\ninfirmity being that the earlier laws were void for absence of competence in\n\nthe legislature, the fresh laws cured the defect of the absence of legislative\n\ncompetence.\n\n555 Ibid, at page 306\nPART J\n\n317 Parliament and the State Legislatures have plenary power to legislate\n\non subjects which fall within their legislative competence. The power is\n\nplenary because the legislature can legislate with prospective as well as with\n\nretrospective effect. Where a law suffers from a defect or has been\n\ninvalidated, it is open to the legislature to remove the defect. While doing that,\n\nthe legislature can validate administrative acts or decisions made under the\n\ninvalid law in the past. The true test of a validation is that it must remove the\n\ndefects in the earlier law. It is not enough for the validating law to state that\n\nthe grounds of invalidity of the earlier law are deemed to have been removed.\n\nThe validating law must remove the deficiencies. There were several\n\ndeficiencies in the collection of biometric data during the period between 2009\n\nand 2016, before the Aadhaar Act came into force. The first was the absence\n\nof enabling legislation. As a result, the collection of sensitive personal\n\ninformation took place without the authority of law. Second, the notification of\n\n2009 did not authorize the collection of biometric data. Third, the collection of\n\nbiometric data was without an enabling framework of the nature which the\n\nAadhaar Act put into place with effect from 2016. The Aadhaar Act introduced\n\na regime for obtaining informed consent, securing the confidentiality of\n\ninformation collected from citizens, penalties and offences for breach and\n\nregulated the uses to which the data which was collected could be put. In the\n\nabsence of safeguards, the collection of biometric data prior of the enactment\n\nof Aadhaar Act 2016 is ultra vires.\nPART J\nSection 59\ndoes not remove the cause for invalidity. First,\nSection 59\n\nprotects actions taken under the notification of 2009. The notification does not\n\nauthorize the collection of biometric data. Hence,\nSection 59\nwould not\n\nprovide legal authority for the collection of biometrics between 2009 and 2016.\n\nSecond, it was through the Aadhaar Act, that safeguards were sought to be\n\nintroduced for ensuring informed consent, confidentiality of information\n\ncollected, restrictions on the use of the data and through a regime of penalties\n\nand offences for violation.\nSection 59\ndoes not cure the absence of these\n\nsafeguards between 2009 and 2016.\nSection 59\nfails to meet the test of a\n\nvalidating law for the simple reason that the absence of safeguards and of a\n\nregulatory framework is not cured merely by validating what was done under\n\nthe notifications of 2009 and 2016. There can be no dispute about the\n\nprinciple that the legislature is entitled to cure the violation of a fundamental\n\nright. But in order to do so, it is necessary to cure the basis or the foundation\n\non which there was a violation of the fundamental right. The deficiency must\n\nbe demonstrated to be cured by the validating law.\nSection 59\nevidently fails\n\nto do so. It fails to remedy the deficiencies in regard to the conditions under\n\nwhich the collection of biometric data took place before the enforcement of the\n\nAadhaar Act in 2016.\n\nThe Respondents submitted that\nSection 59\ncreates a deemed fiction and\n\ncited a few judgments in support of this contention. In Bishambhar Nath\nPART J\n\nKohli v State of Uttar Pradesh556, an Ordinance repealed another\n\nOrdinance.\nSection 58(3)\nof the repealing Ordinance stated:\n\n“6…The repeal by this Act of the Administration of Evacuee\nProperty Ordinance, 1949 or the Hyderabad Administration of\nEvacuee Property Regulation or of any corresponding law\nshall not affect the previous operation of that Ordinance,\nRegulation or corresponding law, and subject thereto,\nanything done or any action taken in the exercise of any\npower conferred by or under that Ordinance, Regulation\nor corresponding law, shall be deemed to have been\ndone or taken in the exercise of the powers conferred by\nor under this Act as if this Act were in force on the day\non which such thing was done or action was taken.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n319 A Constitution Bench of this Court held that by virtue of\nSection 58\n, all\n\nthings done and actions taken under the repealed ordinance are deemed to\n\nbe done or taken in exercise of the powers conferred by the repealing Act, as\n\nif that Act were in force on the day on which that thing was done or action was\n\ntaken. The things done or actions taken under the repealed ordinance are to\n\nbe deemed by fiction to have been done or taken under the repealing Act. The\n\nactions were validated because the Act, in this case, was deemed to be “in\n\nforce on the day on which such thing was done or action was taken”. Section\n\n59 of the Aadhaar Act does not create this fiction. The Aadhaar Act does not\n\ncome in force on the date on which the actions, which this Section seeks to\n\nvalidate, were taken.\n\n320 A three judge Bench headed by one of us, Hon’ble Mr Justice Dipak\n\nMisra (as the learned Chief Justice then was) in\nState of Karnataka v State\n\n556 (1966) 2 SCR 158\nPART J\n\nof Tamil Nadu557, was dealing with a batch of civil appeals filed against a final\n\norder of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal constituted under the\nInter-\n\nState River Water Disputes Act, 1956\n.\nSection 6(2)\nof the 1956 Act provides:\n\n“72…6(2).The decision of the Tribunal, after its publication in\nthe Official Gazette by the Central Government under Sub-\nsection (1), shall have the same force as an order or decree\nof the Supreme Court.”558\n\nRelying on\nSection 6(2)\n, it was contended that the jurisdiction of this Court is\n\nousted as it cannot sit in appeal on its own decree. The Court did not accept\n\nthe submission and held:\n\n“74. The language employed in\nSection 6(2)\nsuggests that the\ndecision of the tribunal shall have the same force as the order\nor decree of this Court. There is a distinction between having\nthe same force as an order or decree of this Court and\npassing of a decree by this Court after due adjudication. The\nParliament has intentionally used the words from which it can\nbe construed that a legal fiction is meant to serve the purpose\nfor which the fiction has been created and not intended to\ntravel beyond it. The purpose is to have the binding effect of\nthe tribunal's award and the effectiveness of enforceability.\nThus, it has to be narrowly construed regard being had to the\npurpose it is meant to serve…559\n\n81…it is clear as crystal that the Parliament did not intend to\ncreate any kind of embargo on the jurisdiction of this Court.\nThe said provision was inserted to give the binding effect to\nthe award passed by the tribunal. The fiction has been\ncreated for that limited purpose.”560 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe judgment makes it clear that a deeming fiction cannot travel beyond what\n\nwas originally intended. As stated earlier, the action of collecting and\n\nauthentication of biometrics or the requirement of informed consent finds no\n\n557 (2017) 3 SCC 362\n558 Ibid, at page 405\n559 Ibid, at page 406\n560 Ibid, at page 408\nPART J\n\nmention in the 2009 notification. Therefore,\nSection 59\ncannot be held to\n\ncreate a deeming fiction that all the actions taken under the notifications\n\nissued were done under the Act and not under the aforesaid notifications.\n\n321 This Court must also deal with the Respondents’ submission that\n\nParliament is not debarred from enacting a validation law even though the\n\nCourt did not have the opportunity to rule on the validity of the notifications\n\nwhich are purported by\nSection 59\nto have been validated. The Respondents\n\nhave placed reliance on a two judge Bench decision in\nAmarendra Kumar\n\nMohapatra v State of Orissa.561 This\ncase involved a challenge to the\n\nconstitutional validity of the\nOrissa Service of Engineers (Validation of\n\nAppointment) Act, 2002\nenacted to regularise ad hoc appointments of\n\nemployees. The issue before the Court was whether the Orissa Act was in\n\neffect a validation statute to validate any illegality or defect in a pre-existing\n\nAct or rule in existence. The Court held that since the Orissa Act merely\n\nregularised the appointment of graduate Stipendiary Engineers working as ad\n\nhoc Assistant Engineers as Assistant Engineers, it could not be described as\n\na validating law. It was held the legislation did not validate any such non-\n\nexistent act, but simply appointed the ad hoc Assistant Engineers as\n\nsubstantive employees of the State by resort to a fiction. This Court held:\n\n“31…a prior judicial pronouncement declaring an act,\nproceedings or rule to be invalid is not a condition precedent\nfor the enactment of a Validation Act. Such a piece of\nlegislation may be enacted to remove even a perceived\ninvalidity, which the Court has had no opportunity to adjudge.\n\n561 (2014) 4 SCC 583\nPART J\n\nAbsence of a judicial pronouncement is not, therefore, of\nmuch significance for determining whether or not the\nlegislation is a validating law.”562\n\nThe\nCourt further held\nthat:\n\n“25. … when the validity of any such Validation Act is called in\nquestion, the Court would have to carefully examine the\nlaw and determine whether (i) the vice of invalidity that\nrendered the act, rule, proceedings or action invalid has\nbeen cured by the validating legislation (ii) whether the\nlegislature was competent to validate the act, action,\nproceedings or rule declared invalid in the previous\njudgments and (iii) whether such validation is consistent\nwith the rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.\nIt is only when the answer to all these three questions is in\nthe affirmative that the Validation Act can be held to be\neffective and the consequences flowing from the adverse\npronouncement of the Court held to have been neutralised.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n322 The two judge Bench relied upon the Constitution Bench decision of\n\nthis Court in\nShri Prithvi Cotton Mills Ltd v Broach Borough\n\nMunicipality563\nto formulate the following pre-requisites of a piece of\n\nlegislation that purports to validate any act, rule, action or proceedings:\n\n“(a) The legislature enacting the Validation Act should be\ncompetent to enact the law and;\n\n(b) the cause for ineffectiveness or invalidity of the Act or the\nproceedings needs to be removed.”\n\nThese judgments suggest that while there can be no disagreement with the\n\nproposition that a legislature has the power, within its competence, to make a\n\nlaw to validate a defective law, the validity of such a law would depend upon\n\nwhether it removes the cause of ineffectiveness or invalidity of the previous\n\n562 Ibid, at page 604\n563 (1969) 2 SCC 283\nPART K\n\nAct\nor proceedings. Parliament has the power to enact a law of validation to\n\ncure an illegality or defect in the pre-existing law, with or without a judicial\n\ndetermination. But that law should cure the cause of infirmity or invalidity.\n\nSection 59\nfails to cure the cause of invalidity prior to the enactment of the\n\nAadhaar Act.\n\nK Rule of law and violation of interim orders\n\n323 The rule of law is the cornerstone of modern democratic societies and\n\nprotects the foundational values of a democracy. When the rule of law is\n\ninterpreted as a principle of constitutionalism, it assumes a division of\n\ngovernmental powers or functions that inhibits the exercise of arbitrary State\n\npower. It also assumes the generality of law: the individual's protection from\n\narbitrary power consists in the fact that her personal dealings with the State\n\nare regulated by general rules, binding on private citizens and public officials\n\nalike.564\n\nIt envisages a fundamental separation of powers among different organs of\n\nthe State. Separation of power supports the accountability aspect of the rule of\n\nlaw. Separation of the judicial and executive powers is an essential feature of\n\nthe rule of law. By entrusting the power of judicial review to courts, the\n\ndoctrine prevents government officials from having the last word on whether\n\n564T.\nR. S. Allan, Constitutional Justice: A Liberal Theory of the Rule of Law\n(2001), available at\nhttp://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199267880.001.0001/acprof-9780199267880-\nchapter-2\nPART K\n\nthey have acted illegally. The separation of judicial power provides an\n\neffective check on the executive branch.565\n\n324 The concepts of the rule of law and separation of powers have been\n\nintegral to Indian constitutional discourse. While both these concepts have not\n\nbeen specified in as many words in the Constitution, they have received\n\nimmense attention from this Court in its judgments. Though the Indian\n\nConstitution does not follow the doctrine of separation of powers in a rigid\n\nsense, the following statement of the law by Chief Justice Mukherjea in\nRam\n\nSahib Ram Jawaya Kapur v State of Punjab566\nis widely regarded as\n\ndefining the core of its content:\n\n“12…The Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the\ndoctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the\nfunctions of the different parts or branches of the Government\nhave been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can\nvery well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate\nassumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions\nthat essentially belong to another...”\n\nSeparation of powers envisages a system of checks and balances, which\n\nensures governance by law and not by the caprice of those to whom\n\ngovernance is entrusted for the time being. By curbing excesses of power, it\n\nhas a direct link with the preservation of institutional rectitude and individual\n\nliberty.\nIn\nS G Jaisinghani v Union of India567\n, this Court held that:\n\n“14. In this context it is important to emphasize that the\nabsence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule of\n\n565Denise Meyerson, The Rule of Law and the Separation of Powers (2004), available at\nhttp://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2004/1.html\n566 (1955) 2 SCR 225\n567 (1967) 2 SCR 703\nPART K\n\nlaw upon which our whole constitutional system is based. In a\nsystem governed by rule of law, discretion, when conferred\nupon executive authorities, must be confined within clearly\ndefined limits. The rule of law from this point of view means\nthat decisions should be made by the application of known\nprinciples and rules and, in general, such decisions should be\npredictable and the citizen should know where he is. If a\ndecision is taken without any principle or without any rule it is\nunpredictable and such a decision is the antithesis of a\ndecision taken in accordance with the Rule of law…”\n\nThe separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the\n\njudiciary has been declared to be part of the basic structure of the\n\nConstitution. In Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala568, Chief Justice\n\nSikri held that:\n\n“292…The basic structure may be said to consist of the\nfollowing features:\n\n(1) Supremacy of the Constitution;\n\n(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government;\n(3) Secular character of the Constitution;\n(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the\nexecutive and the judiciary;\n\n(5) Federal character of the Constitution.”569\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nJustice HR Khanna held that the rule of law meant “supremacy of the\n\nConstitution and the laws as opposed to arbitrariness”570. The same view is\n\nexpressed in subsequent decisions of this Court.571 In Smt Indira Nehru\n\nGandhi v Shri Raj Narain572, Chief Justice AN Ray held the rule of law to be\n\nthe basis of democracy.\n\n568 (1973) 4 SCC 225\n569 Ibid, at page 366\n570 Ibid, at para 1529\n571Smt.\nIndira Nehru Gandhi v.

State of Tamil Nadu\n, (2007) 2 SCC 1.\n\n572 1975 Supp SCC 1\nPART K\n\nThe functional relationship between separation of powers and the rule of law\n\nwas discussed by a Constitution Bench of this Court in\nState of Tamil Nadu v\n\nState of Kerala573\n, as follows:\n\n“98. Indian Constitution, unlike the Constitution of United\nStates of America and Australia, does not have express\nprovision of separation of powers. However, the structure\nprovided in our Constitution leaves no manner of doubt that\nthe doctrine of separation of powers runs through the Indian\nConstitution. It is for this reason that this Court has\nrecognized separation of power as a basic feature of the\nConstitution and an essential constituent of the rule of law.\nThe doctrine of separation of powers is, though, not expressly\nengrafted in the Constitution, its sweep, operation and\nvisibility are apparent from the Constitution. Indian\nConstitution has made demarcation without drawing formal\nlines between the three organs--legislature, executive and\njudiciary.”\n\nThis Court has consistently held judicial review to be an essential component\n\nof the separation of powers as well as of the rule of law. Judicial review\n\ninvolves determination not only of the constitutionality of law but also of the\n\nvalidity of administrative action. It protects the essence of the rule of law by\n\nensuring that every discretionary power vested in the executive is exercised in\n\na just, reasonable and fair manner.\n\n325 In a reference574 under\nArticle 143\nof the Constitution, a seven judge\n\nBench held that irrespective of “whether or not there is distinct and rigid\n\nseparation of powers under the Indian Constitution”, the judicature has been\n\nentrusted the task of construing the provisions of the Constitution and of\n\nsafeguarding the fundamental rights of citizens. It was held:\n\n573 (2014)12 SCC 696\n574 (1965) 1 SCR 413\nPART K\n\n“41…When a statute is challenged on the ground that it has\nbeen passed by Legislature without authority, or has\notherwise unconstitutionally trespassed on fundamental\nrights, it is for the courts to determine the dispute and decide\nwhether the law passed by the legislature is valid or not… If\nthe validity of any law is challenged before the courts, it is\nnever suggested that the material question as to whether\nlegislative authority has been exceeded or fundamental rights\nhave been contravened, can be decided by the legislatures\nthemselves. Adjudication of such a dispute is entrusted solely\nand exclusively to the Judicature of this country…”\n\nIn his celebrated dissent in\nAdditional District Magistrate, Jabalpur v\n\nShivakant Shukla575, Justice HR Khanna\n, while referring to the rule of law as\n\nthe “antithesis of arbitrariness”, held:\n\n“527…Rule of law is now the accepted norm of all civilised\nsocieties... [E]verywhere it is identified with the liberty of the\nindividual. It seeks to maintain a balance between the\nopposing notions of individual liberty and public order. In\nevery State the problem arises of reconciling human rights\nwith the requirements of public interest. Such harmonising\ncan only be attained by the existence of independent courts\nwhich can hold the balance between citizen and State and\ncompel Governments to conform to the law.”576\n\n326 Judicial review has been held to be one of the basic features of the\n\nConstitution. A seven judge Bench of this Court, in\nL Chandra Kumar v\n\nUnion of India577\n, declared:\n\n“78… the power of judicial review over legislative action\nvested in the High Courts under\nArticle 226\nand in the\nSupreme Court under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution is an\nintegral and essential feature of the Constitution, constituting\npart of its basic structure.”578\n\n575 (1976) 2 SCC 521\n576 Ibid, at page 748\n577 (1997) 3 SCC 261\n578 Ibid, at page 301\nPART K\n\nThe complementary relationship between judicial review, the rule of law and\n\nthe separation of powers is integral to working of the Constitution. This Court\n\nin\nI R Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu579\nheld thus:\n\n“129… Equality, rule of law, judicial review and separation of\npowers form parts of the basic structure of the Constitution.\nEach of these concepts are intimately connected. There can\nbe no rule of law, if there is no equality before the law. These\nwould be meaningless if the violation was not subject to the\njudicial review. All these would be redundant if the legislative,\nexecutive and judicial powers are vested in one organ.\nTherefore, the duty to decide whether the limits have been\ntransgressed has been placed on the judiciary.”580\n\nJudicial review, by protecting individual rights, promotes the foundational\n\nvalues of the Constitution and the rule of law. This Court took note of this\n\naspect in Puttaswamy:\n\n“295. Above all, it must be recognized that judicial review is a\npowerful guarantee against legislative encroachments on life\nand personal liberty. To cede this right would dilute the\nimportance of the protection granted to life and personal\nliberty by the Constitution. Hence, while judicial review in\nconstitutional challenges to the validity of legislation is\nexercised with a conscious regard for the presumption of\nconstitutionality and for the separation of powers between the\nlegislative, executive and judicial institutions, the\nconstitutional power which is vested in the Court must be\nretained as a vibrant means of protecting the lives and\nfreedoms of individuals.”581\n\n327 Constitutional adjudication facilitates answers to the silences of the\n\nConstitution. The task of interpretation is to foster the spirit of the Constitution\n\nas much as its text. This role has exclusively been conferred on the Supreme\n\nCourt and the High Courts to ensure that its values are not diminished by the\n\n579 (2007) 2 SCC 1\n580 Ibid, at page 58\n581 Ibid, at page 497\nPART K\n\nlegislature or the executive. Our Court has been conscious of this role.\nIn\n\nKrishna Kumar Singh v State of Bihar582\n, while dealing with the question\n\nwhether an ordinance (promulgated by the Governor) which has a limited life\n\ncan bring about consequences for the future (in terms of the creation of rights,\n\nprivileges, liabilities and obligations) which will enure beyond its life, a seven\n\njudge Bench held that:\n\n“91…The silences of the Constitution must be imbued\nwith substantive content by infusing them with a\nmeaning which enhances the Rule of law. To attribute to\nthe executive as an incident of the power to frame\nordinances, an unrestricted ability to create binding effects for\nposterity would set a dangerous precedent in a parliamentary\ndemocracy. The court's interpretation of the power to frame\nordinances, which originates in the executive arm of\ngovernment, cannot be oblivious to the basic notion that the\nprimary form of law making is through the legislature...”583\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Court held that the ordinance making power must be carefully structured\n\nto ensure that it remains what the framers of our Constitution intended it to be:\n\nan exceptional power to meet a constitutional necessity.\n\n328 In a constitutional democracy, the power of government, is defined,\n\nlimited, and distributed by the fundamental norms of the Constitution. A\n\nconstitutional democracy holds its political regime accountable, responsible, or\n\nanswerable for its decisions and actions while in public office. 584 A\n\n582 (2017) 3 SCC 1\n583 Ibid, at page 76\n584 Almon Leroy Way, Jr., Constitutional Democracy & Other Political Regimes, available at\n\nhttp://www.proconservative.net/CUNAPolSci201PartTWOA.shtml\nPART K\n\nconstitutional democracy determines the degree and manner of distribution of\n\npolitical authority among the major organs or parts of the government. The\n\nlimits of each institution are set by the Constitution. No institution which has\n\nbeen created by the Constitution can have absolute power. Separation of\n\npowers, envisaged by the Constitution between different institutions acts as a\n\ncheck and balance among the institutions and promotes the rule of law by\n\nensuring that no institution can act in an arbitrary manner. Judicial review as\n\na part of the basic structure of the Indian Constitution and as an essential\n\ncomponent of the rule of law and separation of powers, is intended to ensure\n\nthat every institution acts within its limits. Judicial review promotes\n\ntransparency, consistency and accountability in the administration of law, and\n\nnotions of equity, justice and fairness585. Constitutionalism thus puts a legal\n\nlimitation on the government.\nIt envisages the existence of limited\n\ngovernment. Discretion conferred upon an institution of governance, be it the\n\nlegislature or the executive, is confined within clearly defined limits of the\n\nConstitution. Not only are the organs of the State required to operate within\n\ntheir defined legitimate spheres; they are bound to exercise their powers\n\nwithin these spheres without violating the Constitution.586 Judicial review is a\n\nsanction and agency to enforce the limitations imposed by the Constitution\n\nupon the authority of the organs of the State.\n\n585In Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra\n((1983) 2 SCC 96), the Supreme Court insisted on fairness to women\nin police lock-up and also drafted a code of guidelines for the protection of prisoners in police custody,\nespecially female prisoners.\n\nIn\nVeena Sethi v. State of Bihar\n(AIR 1982 S.C. 1470), the Supreme Court\nextended the reach of rule of law to the poor who constitute the bulk of India by ruling that rule of law does not\nmerely for those who have the means to fight for their rights and expanded the locus standi principle to help the\npoor\n586Durga Das Basu, Limited Government and Judicial Review, LexisNexis, (2016) at pages 123-124\nPART K\n\nThis formulation of the limited power of political authority has been recognized\n\nin several judgments of this Court.\n\nIn\nState of M P v Thakur Bharat Singh587\n,\n\na Constitution Bench held:\n\n“5…Our federal structure is founded on certain fundamental\nprinciples: (1) the sovereignty of the people with limited\nGovernment authority i.e. the Government must be\nconducted in accordance with the will of the majority of the\npeople. The people govern themselves through their\nrepresentatives, whereas the official agencies of the\nexecutive Government possess only such powers as have\nbeen conferred upon them by the people; (2) There is a\ndistribution of powers between the three organs of the\nState — legislative, executive and judicial — each organ\nhaving some check direct or indirect on the other; and (3)\nthe rule of law which includes judicial review of arbitrary\nexecutive action…” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n329 In a decision rendered by a Constitution Bench, in S P Sampath Kumar\n\nv Union of India588, Chief Justice P.N. Bhagwati, in his concurring opinion,\n\nheld:\n\n“3…It is a fundamental principle of our constitutional scheme\nthat every organ of the State, every authority under the\nConstitution, derives its power from the Constitution and has\nto act within the limits of such power. It is a limited\ngovernment which we have under the Constitution and both\nthe executive and the legislature have to act within the limits\nof the power conferred upon them under the Constitution…\nThe judiciary is constituted the ultimate interpreter of the\nConstitution and to it is assigned the delicate task of\ndetermining what is the extent and scope of the power\nconferred on each branch of government, what are the\nlimits on the exercise of such power under the\nConstitution and whether any action of any branch\n\n587(1967) 2 SCR 454\n588 (1987) 1 SCC 124\nPART K\n\ntransgresses such limits. It is also a basic principle of the\nrule of law which permeates every provision of the\nConstitution and which forms its very core and essence that\nthe exercise of power by the executive or any other authority\nmust not only be conditioned by the Constitution but also be\nin accordance with law and it is the judiciary which has to\nensure that the law is observed and there is compliance with\nthe requirements of law on the part of the executive and other\nauthorities…”589 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n330 In\nI R Coelho v State of Tamil Nadu590\n, a nine judge Bench held that\n\ncontrol over government power ensures that the foundational values of a\n\ndemocracy are not damaged:\n\n“43…The principle of constitutionalism advocates a check\nand balance model of the separation of powers; it requires a\ndiffusion of powers, necessitating different independent\ncentres of decision-making… The role of the judiciary is to\nprotect fundamental rights. A modern democracy is based on\nthe twin principles of majority rule and the need to protect\nfundamental rights. According to Lord Steyn, it is job of the\njudiciary to balance the principles ensuring that the\nGovernment on the basis of number does not override\nfundamental rights.”\n\nThe rule of law is an implied limitation on the authority of any institution in a\n\nconstitutional democracy.591\n\n331 Interim orders of courts are an integral element of judicial review.\n\nInterim directions issued on the basis of the prima facie findings in a case are\n\n589 Ibid, at pages 128-129\n590 (2007) 2 SCC 1\n591 K.T. Plantation (P) Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, (2011) 9 SCC 1\nPART K\n\ntemporary arrangements till the matter is finally decided. Interim orders ensure\n\nthat the cause which is being agitated does not become infructuous before the\n\nfinal hearing.592 The power of judicial review is not only about the writs issued\n\nby superior courts or the striking down of governmental action. Entrustment of\n\njudicial review is accompanied by a duty to ensure that judicial orders are\n\ncomplied with. Unless orders are enforced, citizens will lose faith in the\n\nefficacy of judicial review and in the legal system.\n\nIt is in the background of the above constitutional position that this Court must\n\ndeal with the contention that the interim orders passed by this Court, during\n\nthe adjudication of the present dispute were not observed. This Court has\n\nconsistently insisted, through its interim orders, on a restraint on the\n\nmandatory use of Aadhaar. It has been submitted that the interim orders have\n\nbeen violated and several contempt petitions are pending593 before this Court.\n\n332 Prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, the scheme was challenged\n\nbefore this Court. By its interim order dated 23 September 2013 594, a two\n\njudge Bench directed:\n\n“All the matters require to be heard finally. List all matters for\nfinal hearing after the Constitution Bench is over.\n\nIn the meanwhile, no person should suffer for not getting\nthe Aadhaar card in spite of the fact that some authority\nhad issued a circular making it mandatory and when any\nperson applies to get the Aadhaar Card voluntarily, it\nmay be checked whether that person is entitled for it\n\n592State of Assam v.

The following interim directions were issued:\n\n“Having considered the matter, we are of the view that the\nbalance of interest would be best served, till the matter is\nfinally decided by a larger Bench if the Union of India or the\nUIDAI proceed in the following manner:-\n\n1. The Union of India shall give wide publicity in the electronic\nand print media including radio and television networks that it\nis not mandatory for a citizen to obtain an Aadhaar card;\n\n2. The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition for\nobtaining any benefits otherwise due to a citizen;\n\n3. The Unique Identification Number or the Aadhaar card will\nnot be used by the respondents for any purpose other than\nthe PDS Scheme and in particular for the purpose of\ndistribution of foodgrains, etc. and cooking fuel, such as\nkerosene. The Aadhaar card may also be used for the\npurpose of the LPG Distribution Scheme;\n\n4. The information about an individual obtained by the Unique\nIdentification Authority of India while issuing an Aadhaar card\nshall not be used for any other purpose, save as above,\nexcept as may be directed by a Court for the purpose of\ncriminal investigation.”\n\nOn 15 October 2015, a Constitution Bench of this Court partially modified the\n\norder dated 11 August 2015, thus:\n\n“3…we are of the view that in paragraph 3 of the Order dated\n11.08.2015, if we add, apart from the other two Schemes,\nnamely, P.D.S. Scheme and the L.P.G. Distribution Scheme,\nthe Schemes like The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural\nEmployment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), National\nSocial Assistance Programme (Old Age Pensions, Widow\nPensions, Disability Pensions), Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan\nYojana (PMJDY) and Employees’ Provident Fund\nOrganisation (EPFO) for the present, it would not dilute earlier\norder passed by this Court. Therefore, we now include the\naforesaid Schemes apart from the other two Schemes that\nthis Court has permitted in its earlier order dated 11.08.2015.\nPART K\n\n4. We impress upon the Union of India that it shall strictly\nfollow all the earlier orders passed by this Court commencing\nfrom 23.09.2013.\n\n5. We will also make it clear that the Aadhaar card Scheme is\npurely voluntary and it cannot be made mandatory till the\nmatter is finally decided by this Court one way or the other.”\n\nAfter the Aadhaar Act was enacted there was a challenge in\nAll Bengal\n\nMinority Students Council v Union of India596\n, to a letter written to the Chief\n\nSecretaries/Administrators of all State Governments/Union territory\n\nAdministrations by the Under Secretary to the Government of India, by which\n\nthe requirement of the submission of Aadhaar for claiming benefits under a\n\nscheme was made mandatory. By an order dated 14 September 2016, a two\n\njudge Bench directed as follows:\n\n“…we stay the operation and implementation of letters dated\n14.07.2006 (i.e. Annexure P-5, P-6 and P-7) for Pre-Matric\nScholarship Scheme, Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme and\nMerit-cum-Means Scholarship Scheme to the extent they\nhave made submission of Aadhaar mandatory and direct the\nMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology,\nGovernment of India i.e. Respondent No.2 to remove\nAadhaar number as a mandatory condition for student\nRegistration form at the National Scholarship Portal of\nMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology,\nGovernment of India at the website\nhttp://scholarships.gov.in/newStudentRegFrm and stay the\nimplementation of clause (c) of the 'Important Instructions' of\nthe advertisement dated 20.08.2016 for the Pre-Matric\nScholarship Scheme, Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme and\nMerit-cum-Means Scholarship Scheme, during the pendency\nof this writ petition.”\n\nIt has been submitted that the notifications and circulars, which make the\n\napplication of Aadhaar mandatory, are contrary to the interim orders passed\n\nby this Court. It has been contended that the Respondents have flouted the\n\n596 WP (Civil) No. 686/2016\nPART K\n\nmost elementary norms of good governance and have disrespected judicial\n\norders. This contention requires serious consideration.\n\n333 The legislature cannot simply declare that the judgment of a court is\n\ninvalid or that it stands nullified. In Kalpana Mehta, a Constitution Bench of\n\nthis Court held:\n\n“255…If the legislature were permitted to do so, it would\ntravel beyond the boundaries of constitutional entrustment.\nWhile the separation of powers prevents the legislature from\nissuing a mere declaration that a judgment is erroneous or\ninvalid, the law-making body is entitled to enact a law which\nremedies the defects which have been pointed out by the\ncourt. Enactment of a law which takes away the basis of the\njudgment (as opposed to merely invalidating it) is permissible\nand does not constitute a violation of the separation doctrine.\nThat indeed is the basis on which validating legislation is\npermitted.”597\n\nWhere a final judgment or order of this Court is sought to be undone by an Act\n\nof Parliament, it is imperative that the basis of the Court’s judgment or order is\n\nremoved. It has been held by this Court in\nBhubaneshwar Singh v Union of\n\nIndia598\n:\n\n“11. From time to time controversy has arisen as to whether the\neffect of judicial pronouncements of the High Court or the\nSupreme Court can be wiped out by amending the legislation\nwith retrospective effect. Many such Amending Acts are called\nValidating Acts, validating the action taken under the particular\nenactments by removing the defect in the statute\nretrospectively because of which the statute or the part of it had\nbeen declared ultra vires. Such exercise has been held by this\nCourt as not to amount to encroachment on the judicial power\nof the courts. The exercise of rendering ineffective the\njudgments or orders of competent courts by changing the\nvery basis by legislation is a well-known device of\nvalidating legislation. This Court has repeatedly pointed out\n\n597 Ibid, at page 126\n598 (1994) 6 SCC 77\nPART K\n\nthat such validating legislation which removes the cause of the\ninvalidity cannot be considered to be an encroachment on\njudicial power. At the same time, any action in exercise of\nthe power under any enactment which has been declared\nto be invalid by a court cannot be made valid by a\nValidating Act by merely saying so unless the defect which\nhas been pointed out by the court is removed with\nretrospective effect. The validating legislation must remove\nthe cause of invalidity. Till such defect or the lack of\nauthority pointed out by the court under a statute is\nremoved by the subsequent enactment with retrospective\neffect, the binding nature of the judgment of the court\ncannot be ignored.”599 (Emphasis supplied)\n\nWhen the Aadhaar Act was notified on 25 March 2016, the interim directions\n\nissued by this court were in operation. Was it then open to government to\n\nlaunch upon a virtual spree of administrative notifications making Aadhaar a\n\nmandatory requirement of virtually every aspect of human existence from birth\n\nuntil death?\n\nThe position which the Union government has adopted before this court is\n\nsimply this: interim directions were issued by this court when the Aadhaar\n\nproject was governed by executive instructions. Once a law was enacted by\n\nParliament, a statutory authorisation was brought into existence to enable\n\ngovernment to issue administrative instructions. Hence, compliance with the\n\ninterim orders stands obviated upon the enactment of the law.\n\n334 This defence of government can be scrutinized at two levels – the first\n\nas a matter of statutory interpretation and the second, on a broader\n\nfoundation which engages the judicial power of this court. As a matter of\n599 Ibid at pages 83-84\nPART K\n\nstatutory interpretation, the Aadhaar Act did not, as it could not have, merely\n\nnullified the interim orders of this court.\nSection 59\nhas no provision which\n\ngives it overriding effect notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of a\n\ncourt. The interim orders do not stand superseded. Apart from approaching\n\nthe issue purely as a matter of statutory interpretation, there are broader\n\nconcerns which arise from the manner in which the authorities proceeded,\n\noblivious to the interim directions. Interim directions were issued by this court\n\nin a situation where a constitutional challenge was addressed in a batch of\n\npetitions on the ground that the Aadhaar project was offensive to fundamental\n\nrights, including the right to privacy. So significant was the nature of the\n\nchallenge that it was referred initially to a Constitution Bench and thereafter,\n\nto a bench of nine-judges of this Court for resolving the question as to\n\nwhether privacy is a protected fundamental right. The collection and storage\n\nof biometric data and its use for the purpose of authentication is the subject of\n\na constitutional challenge. Noting the nature of the challenge and after\n\nconsidering the serious issues which have arisen in the case, successive\n\nbenches of this Court issued a series of interim directions. The purport of\n\nthose directions is that Aadhaar could not be made mandatory except for\n\nspecified schemes which were listed by the court. Moreover, in the context of\n\nthe serious grievance of financial exclusion, the court directed that no\n\nindividual should be excluded from the receipt of welfare entitlements, such as\n\nfood-grains, for want of an Aadhaar number. The constitutional challenge was\n\nnot obviated merely on the enactment of the Aadhaar Act. The law gave a\nPART K\n\nstatutory character to a project which since 2009 was possessed of an\n\nadministrative or executive nature. The constitutional challenge to some of the\n\nbasic features underlying the collection of biometric data still remained to be\n\naddressed by the court. The proceedings before this Court are testimony to\n\nthe fact that the issue of constitutionality was indeed live. That being the\n\nposition, the issuance of a spate of administrative notifications is in defiance\n\nof the interim orders passed by this Court. Judicial orders, be they interim or\n\nfinal, cannot simply be wished away. If governments or citizens were allowed\n\nto ignore judicially enforceable directions, that would negate the basis of the\n\nrule of law. Both propriety and constitutional duty required Union government\n\nto move this Court after the enactment of the Aadhaar Act for variation of the\n\ninterim orders. Such an application would have required this Court to weigh\n\non the one hand the subsequent development of the law being passed\n\n(something which would be relied upon by government) with the constitutional\n\nconcerns over the entire biometric project. It is not as if that the mere\n\nenactment of the law put an end to the constitutional challenge. The existence\n\nof law (post 2016) is only one aspect to be considered in deciding the interim\n\narrangement which would hold the field when the constitutional challenge was\n\npending adjudication before this Court. Institutions of governance are bound\n\nby a sense of constitutional morality which requires them to abide by judicial\n\norders. What seems to emerge from the course of action which has been\n\nfollowed in the present case by government is a perception that judicial\n\ndirections can be ignored on a supposed construction of the statute. Besides\nPART K\n\nthe fact that this construction is erroneous in law, it is above all, the\n\nfundamental duty of this Court to ensure that its orders are not treated with\n\ndisdain. If we were not to enforce a punctilious compliance with our own\n\ndirections by government, that would ring a death – knell of the institutional\n\nposition of the Supreme Court. If governments were free to ignore judicial\n\ndirections at will, could a different yardstick be applied to citizens?\nThe\n\nobligation to comply with judicial orders is universal to our polity and admits of\n\nno exception. Confronted with a brazen disregard of our interim orders, I\n\nbelieve that we have no course open except to stand firm.\n\n335 The power of judicial review conferred on an independent judiciary\n\nrequires that other organs of the State respect the authority of Courts. This\n\nCourt in\nP Sambamurthy v State of Andhra Pradesh600\n, while highlighting\n\nthe importance of judicial review in the rule of law regime, held thus:\n\n“4… it is a basic principle of the rule of law that the exercise\nof power by the executive or any other authority must not only\nbe conditioned by the Constitution but must also be in\naccordance with law and the power of judicial review is\nconferred by the Constitution with view to ensuring that the\nlaw is observed and there is compliance with the requirement\nof law on the part of the executive and other authorities. It is\nthrough the power of judicial review conferred on an\nindependent institutional authority such as the High Court that\nthe rule of law is maintained and every organ of the State is\nkept within the limits- of the law. Now if the exercise of the\npower of judicial review can be set at naught by the State\nGovernment by overriding the decision given against it, it\nwould sound, the death-knell of the rule of law. The rule\nof law would cease to have any meaning, because then it\nwould be open to the State Government to defy the law\nand yet get away with it.”601 (Emphasis supplied)\n\n600 (1987) 1 SCC 362\n601 Ibid, at page 369\nPART K\n\n336 A Bench of two judges in Re: Arundhati Roy602 held that for the courts\n\nto protect the rule of law, it is necessary that the dignity and authority of the\n\ncourts have to be respected and protected. It was held:\n\n“‘Rule of Law’ is the basic rule of governance of any civilised\ndemocratic policy. Our Constitutional scheme is based upon\nthe concept of Rule of Law which we have adopted and given\nto ourselves. Everyone, whether individually or collectively is\nunquestionably under the supremacy of law. Whoever the\nperson may be, however high he or she is, no-one is above\nthe law notwithstanding how powerful and how rich he or she\nmay be. For achieving the establishment of the rule of\nlaw, the Constitution has assigned the special task to the\njudiciary in the country. It is only through the courts that\nthe rule of law unfolds its contents and establishes its\nconcept. For the judiciary to perform its duties and\nfunctions effectively and true to the spirit with which it is\nsacredly entrusted, the dignity and authority of the\ncourts have to be respected and protected at all costs.”603\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe accountability of power, as a component of the rule of law, requires that\n\nthe power vested in any organ of the State, and its agents, can only be used\n\nfor promotion of constitutional values and vision.604 Governmental authority\n\nmay only be exercised in accordance with written laws which are adopted\n\nthough an established procedure. No action of the legislature or the executive\n\ncan undermine the authority of the courts, except according to established\n\nprinciples. Disrespect of court orders results in impairment of the dignity of the\n\ncourts.\n\n602 (2002) 3 SCC 343\n603 Ibid, at page 346\nNandini Sundar v State of Chhattisgarh\n, (2011) 7 SCC 547\nPART K\n\n337 Constitutional morality requires a government not to act in a manner\n\nwhich would become violative of the rule of law.605 Constitutional morality\n\nrequires that the orders of this Court be complied with, faithfully. This Court is\n\nthe ultimate custodian of the Constitution. The limits set by the Constitution\n\nare enforced by this Court. Constitutional morality requires that the faith of the\n\ncitizens in the constitutional courts of the country be maintained. The\n\nimportance of the existence of courts in the eyes of citizens has been\n\nhighlighted in Harper Lee’s classic “To Kill a Mockingbird”:\n\n“But there is one way in this country in which all men are\ncreated equal—there is one human institution that makes a\npauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of\nan Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college\npresident. That institution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be\nthe Supreme Court of the United States or the humblest J.P.\ncourt in the land, or this honorable court which you serve. Our\ncourts have their faults, as does any human institution, but in\nthis country our courts are the great levelers, and in our\ncourts all men are created equal.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\nMany citizens, although aggrieved, are not in a condition to reach the highest\n\nCourt. The poorest and socially neglected lack resources and awareness to\n\nreach this Court. Their grievances remain unaddressed. Such individuals\n\nsuffer injury each day without remedy. Disobedience of the interim orders of\n\nthis Court and its institutional authority, in the present case, has made a\n\nsocietal impact. It has also resulted in denial of subsidies and other benefits\n\nessential to the existence of a common citizen. Constitutional morality\n\ntherefore needs to be enforced as a valid response to these arbitrary acts.\n\nNon-compliance of the interim orders of this Court is contrary to constitutional\nManoj Narula v Union of India\n, (2014) 9 SCC 1\nPART K\n\nmorality. Constitutional morality, as an essential component of the rule of law,\n\nmust neutralise the excesses of power by the executive. The brazen manner\n\nin which notifications have been issued making Aadhaar mandatory, despite\n\nthe interim order of this Court is a matter of serious concern. Deference to the\n\ninstitutional authority of the Supreme Court is integral to the values which the\n\nConstitution adopts. The postulate of a limited government is enforced by the\n\nrole of the Supreme Court in protecting the liberties of citizens and holding\n\ngovernment accountable for its transgressions. The authority of this Court is\n\ncrucial to maintaining the fine balances of power on which democracy thrives\n\nand survives. The orders of the Court are not recommendatory – they are\n\nbinding directions of a constitutional adjudicator. Dilution of the institutional\n\nprestige of this Court can only be at the cost of endangering the freedom of\n\nover a billion citizens which judicial review seeks to safeguard.\n\n338 Courts – as it is often said- have neither the power of the purse nor the\n\nsword. Our authority lies in constitutional legitimacy as much as in public\n\nconfidence. Combined together they impart moral and institutional authority to\n\nthe Court. That sense of legitimacy and duty have required me to assert once\n\nagain the norms of a written Constitution and the rule of law. This judgment\n\nhas taken a much wider postulation. Having held the Aadhaar Act prior to its\n\npassage not to be a Money Bill, I have delved into the merits of the\n\nconstitutional challenge for two reasons:\nPART L\n\ni. Merits have been argued in considerable detail both by petitioners and the\n\nUnion of India; and\n\nii. As a logical consequence of the view that the Aadhaar legislation is not a\n\nMoney Bill, it would be open to the government to reintroduce fresh\n\nlegislation. The principles governing a law regulating the right to data\n\nprotection and informational privacy have hence been delineated.\n\nL Conclusion\n\n339 The present dispute has required this Court to analyze the provisions of\n\nthe Aadhaar Act and Regulations, along with the framework as it existed prior\n\nto the enactment of the Act, through the prism of the Constitution and the\n\nprecedents of this Court. My conclusions are outlined below:\n\n(1) In order to deal with the challenge that the Aadhaar Act should not have\n\nbeen passed as a Money Bill, this Court was required to adjudicate\n\nwhether the decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to certify a Bill as a\n\nMoney Bill, can be subject to judicial review. The judgment has analyzed\n\nthe scope of the finality attributed to the Speaker’s decision, by looking at\n\nthe history of\nArticle 110(3)\nof the Constitution, by comparing it with the\n\ncomparative constitutional practices which accord finality to the Speaker’s\n\ndecision, by analyzing other constitutional provisions which use the phrase\nPART L\n\n“shall be final”, and by examining the protection granted to parliamentary\n\nproceedings under\nArticle 122.\nThis judgment holds that:\n\n(a) The phrase “shall be final” used under\nArticle 110(3)\naims at avoiding\n\nany controversy on the issue as to whether a Bill is a Money Bill, with\n\nrespect to the Rajya Sabha and before the President. The language\n\nused in\nArticle 110(3)\ndoes not exclude judicial review of the Speaker’s\n\ndecision. This also applies to\nArticle 199(3).\n\n(b) The immunity from judicial review provided to parliamentary\n\nproceedings under\nArticle 122\nis limited to instances involving\n\n“irregularity of procedure”. The decisions of this Court in Special\n\nReference, Ramdas Athawale and Raja Ram Pal hold that the validity\n\nof proceedings in Parliament or a State Legislature can be subject to\n\njudicial review when there is a substantive illegality or a constitutional\n\nviolation. These judgments make it clear that the decision of the\n\nSpeaker is subject to judicial review, if it suffers from illegality or from a\n\nviolation of constitutional provisions.\n\n(c)\nArticle 255\nhas no relation with the decision of the Speaker on whether\n\na Bill is a Money Bill. The three Judge Bench decision in Mohd Saeed\n\nSiddiqui erroneously interpreted the judgment in Mangalore Beedi to\n\napply\nArticles 212 (or\nArticle 122\n)\nand\nto refrain from questioning\n\nthe conduct of the Speaker (under\nArticle 199\nor 110). The two judge\nPART L\n\nBench decision in Yogendra Kumar followed Mohd Saeed Siddiqui.\n\nThe correct position of law is that the decision of the Speaker under\n\nArticles 110(3)\nand\n199(3)\nis not immune from judicial review. The\n\ndecisions in Mohd Saeed Siddiqui and Yogendra Kumar are\n\naccordingly overruled.\n\n(d) The existence of and the role of the Rajya Sabha, as an institution of\n\nfederal bicameralism in the Indian Parliament, constitutes a part of the\n\nbasic structure of the Constitution. The decision of the Speaker of the\n\nLok Sabha to certify a Bill as a Money Bill has a direct impact on the\n\nrole of the Rajya Sabha, since the latter has a limited role in the passing\n\nof a Money Bill. A decision of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha to declare\n\nan ordinary Bill to be a Money Bill limits the role of the Rajya Sabha.\n\nThe power of the Speaker cannot be exercised arbitrarily in violation of\n\nconstitutional norms and values, as it damages the essence of federal\n\nbicameralism, which is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution.\n\nJudicial review of the Speaker’s decision, on whether a Bill is a Money\n\nBill, is therefore necessary to protect the basic structure of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n(2) To be certified a Money Bill, a Bill must contain “only provisions” dealing\n\nwith every or any one of the matters set out in sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\n\nArticle 110(1).\nA Bill, which has both provisions which fall within sub-\n\nclauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110(1)\nand provisions which fall outside their\nPART L\n\nscope, will not qualify to be a Money Bill. Thus, when a Bill which has\n\nbeen passed as a Money Bill has certain provisions which fall beyond the\n\nscope of sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110(1)\n, these provisions cannot\n\nbe severed. If the bill was not a Money Bill, the role of the Rajya Sabha in\n\nits legislative passage could not have been denuded. The debasement of\n\na constitutional institution cannot be countenanced by the Court.\n\nDemocracy survives when constitutional institutions are vibrant.\n\n(3) The Aadhaar Act creates a statutory framework for obtaining a unique\n\nidentity number, which is capable of being used for “any” purpose, among\n\nwhich availing benefits, subsidies and services, for which expenses are\n\nincurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, is just one purpose provided\n\nunder\nSection 7\n. Clause (e) of\nArticle 110(1)\nrequires that a Money Bill\n\nmust deal with the declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure charged\n\non the Consolidated Fund of India (or increasing the amount of the\n\nexpenditure).\nSection 7\nfails to fulfil this requirement.\nSection 7\ndoes not\n\ndeclare the expenditure incurred to be a charge on the Consolidated\n\nFund. It only provides that in the case of such services, benefits or\n\nsubsidies, Aadhaar can be made mandatory to avail of them. Moreover,\n\nprovisions other than\nSection 7\nof the Act deal with several aspects\n\nrelating to the Aadhaar numbers: enrolment on the basis of demographic\n\nand biometric information, generation of Aadhaar numbers, obtaining the\n\nconsent of individuals before collecting their individual information,\nPART L\n\ncreation of a statutory authority to implement and supervise the process,\n\nprotection of information collected during the process, disclosure of\n\ninformation in certain circumstances, creation of offences and penalties for\n\ndisclosure or loss of information, and the use of the Aadhaar number for\n\n“any purpose”. All these provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not lie within the\n\nscope of sub-clauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110(1).\nHence, in the alternate,\n\neven if it is held that\nSection 7\nbears a nexus to the expenditure incurred\n\nfrom the Consolidated Fund of India, the other provisions of the Act fail to\n\nfall within the domain of\nArticle 110(1).\nThus, the Aadhaar Act is declared\n\nunconstitutional for failing to meet the necessary requirements to have\n\nbeen certified as a Money Bill under\nArticle 110(1).\n\n(4) The argument that the Aadhaar Act is in pith and substance a Money Bill,\n\nwith its main objective being the delivery of subsidies, benefits and\n\nservices flowing out of the Consolidated Fund of India and that the other\n\nprovisions are ancillary to the main purpose of the Act also holds no\n\nground, since the doctrine of pith and substance is used to examine\n\nwhether the legislature has the competence to enact a law with regard to\n\nany of the three Lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. The\n\ndoctrine cannot be invoked to declare whether a Bill satisfies the\n\nrequirements set out in\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution to be certified a\n\nMoney Bill. The argument of the Union of India misses the point that a Bill\nPART L\n\ncan be certified as a Money Bill “only” if it deals with all or any of the\n\nmatters contained in clauses (a) to (g) of\nArticle 110(1).\n\n(5) Having held that the Aadhaar Act is unconstitutional for having been\n\npassed as a Money Bill this judgment has also analysed the merits of the\n\nother constitutional challenges to the legislation as well as to the\n\nframework of the project before the law was enacted.\n\n(6) The architecture of the Aadhaar Act seeks to create a unique identity for\n\nresidents on the basis of their demographic and biometric information.\nThe\n\nAct\nsets up a process of identification by which the unique identity\n\nassigned to each individual is verified with the demographic and biometric\n\ninformation pertaining to that individual which is stored in a centralised\n\nrepository of data. Identification of beneficiaries is integral and essential to\n\nthe fulfilment of social welfare schemes and programmes, which are a part\n\nof the State’s attempts to ensure that its citizens have access to basic\n\nhuman facilities. This judgment accepts the contention of the Union of\n\nIndia that there is a legitimate state aim in maintaining a system of\n\nidentification to ensure that the welfare benefits provided by the State\n\nreach the beneficiaries who are entitled, without diversion.\n\n(7) The Aadhaar programme involves application of biometric technology,\n\nwhich uses an individual’s biometric data as the basis of authentication or\n\nidentification and is therefore intimately connected to the individual. While\nPART L\n\ncitizens have privacy interests in personal or private information collected\n\nabout them, the unique nature of biometric data distinguishes it from other\n\npersonal data, compounding concerns regarding privacy protections\n\nsafeguarding biometric information. Once a biometric system is\n\ncompromised, it is compromised forever. Therefore, it is imperative that\n\nconcerns about protecting privacy must be addressed while developing a\n\nbiometric system. Adequate norms must be laid down for each step from\n\nthe collection to retention of biometric data. At the time of collection,\n\nindividuals must be informed about the collection procedure, the intended\n\npurpose of the collection, the reason why the particular data set is\n\nrequested and who will have access to their data. Additionally, the\n\nretention period must be justified and individuals must be given the right to\n\naccess, correct and delete their data at any point in time, a procedure\n\nfamiliar to an opt-out option.\n\n(8) Prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, no mandatory obligation was\n\nimposed upon the Registrars or the enrolling agencies, to obtain informed\n\nconsent from residents before recording their biometric data, to inform\n\nthem how the biometric data would be stored and used and about the\n\nexistence of adequate safeguards to secure the data. Moreover, prior to\n\nthe enactment of the Act, while UIDAI had itself contemplated that an\n\nidentity theft could occur at the time of enrollment for Aadhaar cards, it\nPART L\n\nhad no solution to the possible harms which could result after the identity\n\ntheft of a person.\n\n(9) The Regulations framed subsequently under the Aadhaar Act also do not\n\nprovide a robust mechanism on how informed consent is to be obtained\n\nfrom residents before collecting their biometric data. The Aadhaar Act and\n\nRegulations are bereft of the procedure through which an individual can\n\naccess information related to his or her authentication record. The\n\nAadhaar Act clearly has no defined options that should be made available\n\nto the Aadhaar number holders in case they do not wish to submit identity\n\ninformation during authentication, nor do the regulations specify the\n\nprocedure to be followed in case the Aadhaar number holder does not\n\nprovide consent for authentication.\n\n(10)\nSections 29(1)\nand (2) of the Act create a distinction between two classes\n\nof information (core biometric information and identity information), which\n\nare integral to individual identity and require equal protection.\nSection\n\n29(4)\nsuffers from overbreadth as it gives wide discretionary power to\n\nUIDAI to publish, display or post core biometric information of an individual\n\nfor purposes specified by the regulations.\n\n(11)\nSections 2(g)\n, (j), (k) and (t) suffer from overbreadth, as these can lead to\n\nan invasive collection of biological attributes. These provisions give\nPART L\n\ndiscretionary power to UIDAI to define the scope of biometric and\n\ndemographic information and empower it to expand on the nature of\n\ninformation already collected at the time of enrollment, to the extent of\n\nalso collecting any “such other biological attributes” that it may deem fit.\n\n(12) There is no clarity on how an individual is supposed to update his/her\n\nbiometric information, in case the biometric information mismatches with\n\nthe data stored in CIDR. The proviso to Section 28(5) of the Aadhaar Act,\n\nwhich disallows an individual access to the biometric information that\n\nforms the core of his or her unique ID, is violative of a fundamental\n\nprinciple that ownership of an individual’s data must at all times vest with\n\nthe individual. UIDAI is also provided wide powers in relation to removing\n\nthe biometric locking of residents. With this analysis of the measures\n\ntaken by the Government of India prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar\n\nAct as well as a detailed analysis of the provisions under the\nAadhaar Act,\nand supporting Regulations made under it, this judgment concludes\n\nthat the Aadhaar programme violates essential norms pertaining to\n\ninformational privacy, self-determination and data protection.\n\n(13) The State is under a constitutional obligation to safeguard the dignity of\n\nits citizens. Biometric technology which is the core of the Aadhaar\n\nprogramme is probabilistic in nature, leading to authentication failures.\n\nThese authentication failures have led to the denial of rights and legal\nPART L\n\nentitlements. The Aadhaar project has failed to account for and remedy\n\nthe flaws in its framework and design which has led to serious instances\n\nof exclusion of eligible beneficiaries as demonstrated by the official\n\nfigures from Government records including the Economic Survey of India\n\n2016-17 and research studies. Dignity and the rights of individuals cannot\n\nbe made to depend on algorithms or probabilities. Constitutional\n\nguarantees cannot be subject to the vicissitudes of technology. Denial of\n\nbenefits arising out of any social security scheme which promotes socio-\n\neconomic rights of citizens is violative of human dignity and impermissible\n\nunder our constitutional scheme.\n\n(14) The violations of fundamental rights resulting from the Aadhaar scheme\n\nwere tested on the touchstone of proportionality. The measures adopted\n\nby the respondents fail to satisfy the test of necessity and proportionality\n\nfor the following reasons:\n\n(a) Under the Aadhaar project, requesting entities can hold the identity\n\ninformation of individuals, for a temporary period. It was admitted by\n\nUIDAI that AUAs may store additional information according to their\n\nrequirement to secure their system. ASAs have also been permitted to\n\nstore logs of authentication transactions for a specific time period. It has\n\nbeen admitted by UIDAI that it gets the AUA code, ASA code, unique\n\ndevice code and the registered device code used for authentication,\n\nand that UIDAI would know from which device the authentication took\nPART L\n\nplace and through which AUA/ASA. Under the Regulations, UIDAI\n\nfurther stores the authentication transaction data. This is in violation of\n\nwidely recognized data minimisation principles which mandate that data\n\ncollectors and processors delete personal data records when the\n\npurpose for which it has been collected is fulfilled. Moreover, using the\n\nmeta-data related to the transaction, the location of the authentication\n\ncan easily be traced using the IP address, which impacts upon the\n\nprivacy of the individual.\n\n(b) From the verification log, it is possible to locate the places of\n\ntransactions by an individual in the past five years. It is also possible\n\nthrough the Aadhaar database to track the current location of an\n\nindividual, even without the verification log. The architecture of Aadhaar\n\nposes a risk of potential surveillance activities through the Aadhaar\n\ndatabase. Any leakage in the verification log poses an additional risk of\n\nan individual’s biometric data being vulnerable to unauthorised\n\nexploitation by third parties.\n\n(c) The biometric database in the CIDR is accessible to third-party vendors\n\nproviding biometric search and de-duplication algorithms, since neither\n\nthe Central Government nor UIDAI have the source code for the de-\n\nduplication technology which is at the heart of the programme. The\n\nsource code belongs to a foreign corporation. UIDAI is merely a\n\nlicensee. Prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, without the consent\nPART L\n\nof individual citizens, UIDAI contracted with L-1 Identity Solutions (the\n\nforeign entity which provided the source code for biometric storage) to\n\nprovide to it any personal information related to any resident of India.\n\nThis is contrary to the basic requirement that an individual has the right\n\nto protect herself by maintaining control over personal information. The\n\nprotection of the data of 1.2 billion citizens is a question of national\n\nsecurity and cannot be subjected to the mere terms and conditions of a\n\nnormal contract.\n\n(d) Before the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, MOUs signed between UIDAI\n\nand Registrars were not contracts within the purview of\nArticle 299\nof\n\nthe Constitution, and therefore, do not cover the acts done by the\n\nprivate entities engaged by the Registrars for enrolment. Since there is\n\nno privity of contract between UIDAI and the Enrolling agencies, the\n\nactivities of the private parties engaged in the process of enrolment\n\nbefore the enactment of the Aadhaar Act have no statutory or legal\n\nbacking.\n\n(e) Under the Aadhaar architecture, UIDAI is the sole authority which\n\ncarries out all administrative, adjudicatory, investigative, and monitoring\n\nfunctions of the project.\nWhile the Act\nconfers these functions on UIDAI,\n\nit does not place any institutional accountability upon UIDAI to protect\n\nthe database of citizens’ personal information. UIDAI also takes no\n\ninstitutional responsibility for verifying whether the data entered and\nPART L\n\nstored in the CIDR is correct and authentic. The task has been\n\ndelegated to the enrolment agency or the Registrar. Verification of data\n\nbeing entered in the CIDR is a highly sensitive task for which the UIDAI\n\nought to have taken responsibility. The Aadhaar Act is also silent on the\n\nliability of UIDAI and its personnel in case of their non-compliance of\n\nthe provisions of the Act or the regulations.\n\n(f)\nSection 47\nof the Act violates citizens’ right to seek remedies. Under\n\nSection 47(1)\n, a court can take cognizance of an offence punishable\n\nunder the Act only on a complaint made by UIDAI or any officer or\n\nperson authorised by it.\nSection 47\nis arbitrary as it fails to provide a\n\nmechanism to individuals to seek efficacious remedies for violation of\n\ntheir right to privacy. Further,\nSection 23(2)(s)\nof the Act requires UIDAI\n\nto establish a grievance redressal mechanism. Making the authority\n\nwhich is administering a project, also responsible for providing a\n\ngrievance redressal mechanism for grievances arising from the project\n\nseverely compromises the independence of the grievance redressal\n\nbody.\n\n(g)\nWhile the Act\ncreates a regime of criminal offences and penalties, the\n\nabsence of an independent regulatory framework renders the Act\n\nlargely ineffective in dealing with data violations. The architecture of\n\nAadhaar ought to have, but has failed to embody within the law the\n\nestablishment of an independent monitoring authority (with a hierarchy\nPART L\n\nof regulators), along with the broad principles for data protection. This\n\ncompromise in the independence of the grievance redressal body\n\nimpacts upon the possibility and quality of justice being delivered to\n\ncitizens. In the absence of an independent regulatory and monitoring\n\nframework which provides robust safeguards for data protection, the\n\nAadhaar Act cannot pass muster against a challenge on the ground of\n\nreasonableness under\nArticle 14.\n\n(h) No substantive provisions, such as those providing data minimization,\n\nhave been laid down as guiding principles for the oversight mechanism\n\nprovided under\nSection 33(2)\n, which permits disclosure of identity\n\ninformation and authentication records in the interest of national\n\nsecurity.\n\n(i) Allowing private entities to use Aadhaar numbers, under\nSection 57\n, will\n\nlead to commercial exploitation of the personal data of individuals\n\nwithout consent and could also lead to individual profiling. Profiling\n\ncould be used to predict the emergence of future choices and\n\npreferences of individuals. These preferences could also be used to\n\ninfluence the decision making of the electorate in choosing candidates\n\nfor electoral offices. This is contrary to privacy protection norms. Data\n\ncannot be used for any purpose other than those that have been\n\napproved. While developing an identification system of the magnitude\n\nof Aadhaar, security concerns relating to the data of 1.2 billion citizens\nPART L\n\nought to be addressed. These issues have not been dealt with by the\n\nAadhaar Act. By failing to protect the constitutional rights of citizens,\n\nSection 57\nviolates\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n\n(j)\nSection 57\nis susceptible to be applied to permit commercial\n\nexploitation of the data of individuals or to affect their behavioural\n\npatterns.\nSection 57\ncannot pass constitutional muster. Since it is\n\nmanifestly arbitrary, it suffers from overbreadth and violates\nArticle 14.\n\n(k)\nSection 7\nsuffers from overbreadth since the broad definitions of the\n\nexpressions ‘services and ‘benefits’ enable the government to regulate\n\nalmost every facet of its engagement with citizens under the Aadhaar\n\nplatform. If the requirement of Aadhaar is made mandatory for every\n\nbenefit or service which the government provides, it is impossible to live\n\nin contemporary India without Aadhaar. The inclusion of services and\n\nbenefits in\nSection 7\nis a pre-cursor to the kind of function creep which\n\nis inconsistent with the right to informational self-determination.\nSection\nis therefore arbitrary and violative of\nArticle 14\nin relation to the\n\ninclusion of services and benefits as defined.\n\n(l) The legitimate aim of the State can be fulfilled by adopting less intrusive\n\nmeasures as opposed to the mandatory enforcement of the Aadhaar\n\nscheme as the sole repository of identification. The State has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that a less intrusive measure other than biometric\nPART L\n\nauthentication would not subserve its purposes. That the state has\n\nbeen able to insist on an adherence to the Aadhaar scheme without\n\nexception is a result of the overbreadth of\nSection 7\n.\n\n(m) When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, it becomes a bridge\n\nacross discreet data silos, which allows anyone with access to this\n\ninformation to re-construct a profile of an individual’s life. This is\n\ncontrary to the right to privacy and poses severe threats due to potential\n\nsurveillance.\n\n(n) One right cannot be taken away at the behest of the other. The State\n\nhas failed to satisfy this Court that the targeted delivery of subsidies\n\nwhich animate the right to life entails a necessary sacrifice of the right\n\nto individual autonomy, data protection and dignity when both these\n\nrights are protected by the Constitution.\n\n(15) Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act seeks to retrospectively validate the\n\nactions of the Central Government done prior to the Aadhaar Act\n\npursuant to Notifications dated 28 January 2009. and 12 September\n\n2015.\nSection 59\ndoes not validate actions of the state governments or of\n\nprivate entities. Moreover, the notification of 2009 did not authorise the\n\ncollection of biometric data. Consequently, the validation of actions taken\n\nunder the 2009 notification by\nSection 59\ndoes not save the collection of\n\nbiometric data prior to the enforcement of the Act. While Parliament\nPART L\n\npossesses the competence to enact a validating law, it must cure the\n\ncause of infirmity or invalidity.\nSection 59\nfails to cure the cause of\n\ninvalidity prior to the enactment of the Aadhaar Act. The absence of a\n\nlegislative framework for the Aadhaar project between 2009 and 2016 left\n\nthe biometric data of millions of Indian citizens bereft of the kind of\n\nprotection which must be provided to comprehensively protect and\n\nenforce the right to privacy.\nSection 59\ntherefore fails to meet the test of\n\na validating law since the complete absence of a regulatory framework\n\nand safeguards cannot be cured merely by validating what was done\n\nunder the notifications of 2009 and 2016.\n\n(16) The decision in Puttaswamy recognised that revenue constitutes a\n\nlegitimate state aim in the three-pronged test of proportionality. However,\n\nthe existence of a legitimate aim is insufficient to uphold the validity of the\n\nlaw, which must also meet the other parameters of proportionality spelt out\n\nin Puttaswamy.\n\n(17) The seeding of Aadhaar with PAN cards depends on the constitutional\n\nvalidity of the Aadhaar legislation itself.\nSection 139AA\nof the Income Tax\n\nAct 1962 is based on the premise that the Aadhaar Act itself is a valid\n\nlegislation. Since the Aadhaar Act itself is now held to be unconstitutional\n\nfor having been enacted as a Money Bill and on the touchstone of\n\nproportionality, the seeding of Aadhaar to PAN under Article 139AA does\n\nnot stand independently.\nPART L\n\n(18) The 2017 amendments to the PMLA Rules fail to satisfy the test of\n\nproportionality. The imposition of a uniform requirement of linking Aadhaar\n\nnumbers with all account based relationships proceeds on the\n\npresumption that all existing account holders as well as every individual\n\nwho seeks to open an account in future is a potential money-launderer. No\n\ndistinction has been made in the degree of imposition based on the client,\n\nthe nature of the business relationship, the nature and value of the\n\ntransactions or the actual possibility of terrorism and money- laundering.\n\nThe rules also fail to make a distinction between opening an account and\n\noperating an account. Moreover, the consequences of the failure to submit\n\nan Aadhaar number are draconian. In their present form, the rules are\n\nclearly disproportionate and excessive. We clarify that this holding would\n\nnot preclude the Union Government in the exercise of its rule making\n\npower and the Reserve Bank of India as the regulator to re-design the\n\nrequirements in a manner that would ensure due fulfillment of the object of\n\npreventing money-laundering, subject to compliance with the principles of\n\nproportionality as outlined in this judgment.\n\n(19) Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous feature of the lives of people\n\nand the linking of Aadhaar numbers with SIM cards and the requirement of\n\ne-KYC authentication of mobile subscribers must necessarily be viewed in\n\nthis light. Applying the proportionality test, the legitimate aim of subscriber\n\nverification, has to be balanced against the countervailing requirements of\nPART L\n\npreserving the integrity of biometric data and the privacy of mobile phone\n\nsubscribers. Mobile phones are a storehouse of personal data and reflect\n\nupon individual preferences, lifestyle and choices. The conflation of\n\nbiometric information with SIM cards poses grave threats to individual\n\nprivacy, liberty and autonomy. Having due regard to the test of\n\nproportionality which has been propounded in Puttaswamy and as\n\nelaborated in this judgment, the decision to link Aadhaar numbers with\n\nmobile SIM cards is neither valid nor constitutional. The mere existence of\n\na legitimate state aim will not justify the disproportionate means which\n\nhave been adopted in the present case. The biometric information and\n\nAadhaar details collected by Telecom Service Providers shall be deleted\n\nforthwith and no use of the said information or details shall be made by\n\nTSPs or any agency or person or their behalf.\n\n(20) Defiance of judicial orders (both interim and final) be it by the government\n\nor by citizens negates the basis of the rule of law. Both propriety and\n\nconstitutional duty required the Union government to move this Court after\n\nthe enactment of the Aadhaar Act for variation of this Court’s interim\n\norders. Institutions of governance are bound by a sense of constitutional\n\nmorality which requires them to abide by judicial orders.\n\n(21) Identity is necessarily a plural concept. The Constitution also recognizes\n\na multitude of identities through the plethora of rights that it safeguards.\nPART L\n\nThe technology deployed in the Aadhaar scheme reduces different\n\nconstitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and\n\ninfringes the right of an individual to identify herself/himself through a\n\nchosen means. Aadhaar is about identification and is an instrument which\n\nfacilitates a proof of identity. It must not be allowed to obliterate\n\nconstitutional identity.\n\n(22) The entire Aadhaar programme, since 2009, suffers from constitutional\n\ninfirmities and violations of fundamental rights. The enactment of the\n\nAadhaar Act does not save the Aadhaar project. The Aadhaar Act, the\n\nRules and Regulations framed under it, and the framework prior to the\n\nenactment of the Act are unconstitutional.\n\n(23) To enable the government to initiate steps for ensuring conformity with\n\nthis judgment, it is directed under\nArticle 142\nthat the existing data which\n\nhas been collected shall not be destroyed for a period of one year. During\n\nthis period, the data shall not be used for any purpose whatsoever. At the\n\nend of one year, if no fresh legislation has been enacted by the Union\n\ngovernment in conformity with the principles which have been enunciated\n\nin this judgment, the data shall be destroyed.\n\nCreating strong privacy protection laws and instilling safeguards may address\n\nor at the very least assuage some of the concerns associated with the\n\nAadhaar scheme which severely impairs informational self-determination,\nPART L\n\nindividual privacy, dignity and autonomy. In order to uphold the democratic\n\nvalues of the Constitution, the government needs to address the concerns\n\nhighlighted in this judgment which would provide a strong foundation for digital\n\ninitiatives, which are imminent in today’s digital age. However, in its current\n\nform, the Aadhaar framework does not sufficiently assuage the concerns that\n\nhave arisen from the operation of the project which have been discussed in\n\nthis judgment.\n\n……....................................................J\n[Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud]\n\nNew Delhi;\n\nSeptember 26, 2018.\nREPORTABLE\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION\n\nWRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 494 OF 2012\n\nJUSTICE K.S.PUTTASWAMY (RETD.) AND ANR. ...PETITIONERS\n\nVERSUS\n\nUNION OF INDIA AND ORS.    ... RESPONDENTS\n\nWITH\n\nT.C.(C)   No.151/2013,   T.C.(C)   No.152/2013,   W.P.(C)\nNo.833/2013 (PIL­W), W.P.(C) No.829/2013 (PIL­W), T.P.\n(C) No.1797/2013, W.P.(C) No.932/2013 (PIL­W), T.P.(C)\nNo.1796/2013,   CONMT.   PET.(C)   No.144/2014   In   W.P.(C)\nNo.494/2012   (PIL­W),   T.P.(C)   No.313/2014,   T.P.(C)\nNo.312/2014,   SLP(Crl.)   No.2524/2014,   W.P.(C)\nNo.37/2015   (PIL­W),   W.P.(C)   No.220/2015   (PIL­W),\nCONMT.   PET.(C)   No.674/2015   In   W.P.(C)   No.829/2013\n(PIL­W),   T.P.(C)   No.921/2015,   CONMT.   PET.(C)\nNo.470/2015   In   W.P.(C)   No.494/2012   (PIL­W),   W.P.(C)\nNo.231/2016   (PIL­W),   CONMT.   PET.(C)   No.444/2016   In\nW.P.(C)   No.494/2012   (PIL­W),   CONMT.   PET.(C)\nNo.608/2016   In   W.P.(C)   No.494/2012   (PIL­W),   W.P.(C)\nNo.797/2016     (PIL­W),   CONMT.   PET.(C)   No.844/2017   In\nW.P.(C) No.494/2012 (PIL­W), W.P.(C) No.342/2017 (PIL­\nW),   W.P.(C)   No.372/2017,   W.P.(C)   No.841/2017,   W.P.(C)\nNo.1058/2017   (PIL­W),   W.P.(C)   No.966/2017   (PIL­W),\nW.P.(C)   No.   1014/2017   (PIL­W),   W.P.   (C)   No.1002/2017\n(PIL­W),   W.P.(C)   No.1056/2017   and   CONMT.   PET.(C)\nNo.34/2018 in W.P.(C) No.1014/2017 (PIL­W)\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nASHOK BHUSHAN, J.\n\nThe   challenge   in   this   batch   of   cases   can   be\ndivided   in   two   parts,   firstly,   the   challenge   to\n\nExecutive's   Scheme   dated   28.01.2009   notified   by   the\n\nGovernment   of   India,   by   which   the   Unique\n\nIdentification   Authority   of   India   (hereinafter\n\nreferred   to   as   “UIDAI”)   was   constituted   to   implement\n\nthe   UIDAI   Scheme,   and   secondly   challenge   to\nThe\n\nAadhaar     (Targeted   Delivery   of   Financial   and   Other\n\nSubsidies,   Benefits   and   Services)   Act,   2016\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2016”).\n\n2. The group of cases can be divided into four broad\n\nheads.     First   head   consists   of   the   sixteen   Writ\n\nPetitions   filed   under\nArticle   32\nof   the   Constitution\n\nof   India   in   this   Court   challenging   the   notification\n\ndated 28.01.2009 and/or the Act, 2016.\n\nSecond   group   consists   of   seven   Transfer\n\nCases/Transfer   petitions   to   be   heard   alongwith   Writ\n\nPetitions filed under\nArticle 32.\n\nGroup   three   consists   of   only   one   Special   Leave\n\nPetition   (Criminal)   No.   2524   of   2014   filed   by   UIDAI\n\nand   Anr.     Fourth   group   consists   of   seven   Contempt\nPetitions, which have been filed alleging violation of\n\nthe   interim   orders   passed   by   this   Court   in   Writ\n\nPetitions and SLP (Criminal) as noted above.\n\n3. Before   we   come   to   the   different   prayers   made   in\n\nthe   Writ   Petitions   wherein   Executive   Scheme   dated\n\n28.01.2009   as   well   as   Act,   2016   has   been   challenged,\n\nit is useful to notice certain background facts, which\n\nlead   to   issuance   of   notification   dated   28.01.2009   as\n\nwell as the Act, 2016.\n\n4. India   is   a   country,   which   caters   a   sea   of\n\npopulation.     When   the   British   left   our   country   in\n\n1947,   total   population   of   the   country   was   only   330\n\nmillion,   which   has   rapidly   increased   into   enormous\n\nfigure   of   1.3   billion   as   on   date.\nThe   Citizenship\n\nAct,   1955\nwas   enacted   by   the   Parliament   for   the\n\nacquisition   and   determination   of   Indian   Citizenship.\n\nOur   constitutional   framers   have   provided   for   adult\n\nfranchise to every adult citizens. Election Commission\n\nof   India   had   taken   steps   to   provide   for   an   identity\ncard   to   each   person   to   enable   him   to   exercise   his\n\nfranchise.\nThe   Citizenship   Act,   1955\nwas   amended   by\n\nthe   Act   6   of   2004   whereas\nSection   14A\nwas   inserted\n\nproviding   that   Central   Government   may   compulsorily\n\nregister   every   citizen   of   India   and   issue   national\n\nidentity card to him.   The Planning Commission of the\n\nGovernment of India conceived a Unique Identification\n\nProject   for   providing   a   Unique   Identity   Number   for\n\neach resident across the country, which was initially\n\nenvisaged   primarily   as   the   basis   for   the   efficient\n\ndelivery of welfare services.\n\n5. At   first,   in   the   year   2006,   administrative\n\napproval was granted for the project “Unique Identity\n\nfor   BPL   Families”.   A   Process   Committee   was\n\nconstituted, which prepared a strategic vision on the\n\nUnique Identification Project.   The Process Committee\n\nfurnished   a   detailed   proposal   to   the   Planning\n\nCommission   in   the   above   regard.     The   Prime   Minister\n\napproved   the   constitution   of   an   empowered   Group   of\n\nMinisters   to   collate   the   two   spheres,   the   national\npopulation   register   under   the\nCitizenship   Act,   1955\n\nand   the   Unique   Identification   Number   Project   of   the\n\nDepartment   of   Information   Technology.     The   empowered\n\nGroup of Ministers recognised the need for creating an\n\nidentity related resident database and to establish an\n\ninstitutional mechanism, which shall own the database\n\nand   shall   be   responsible   for   its   maintenance   and\n\nupdations   on   ongoing   basis.   The   empowered   Group   of\n\nMinisters   held   various   meetings   to   which   inputs   were\n\nprovided from different sources including Committee of\n\nSecretaries.  The recommendation of empowered Group of\n\nMinisters   to   constitute   Unique   Identification\n\nAuthority   of   India   (hereinafter   referred   to   as\n\n“UIDAI”)   was   accepted   with   several   guidelines   laying\n\ndown the roles and responsibilities of the UIDAI. The\n\nUIDAI   was   constituted   under   the   aegis   of   Planning\n\nCommission   of   India.     The   Notification   dated\n\n28.01.2009   was   issued   constituting   the   UIDAI,\n\nproviding   for   its   composition,   roles   and\n\nresponsibilities.\n6. In   the   year   2010,   a   bill   namely   the   National\n\nIdentification Authority of India Bill, 2010 providing\n\nfor   the   establishment   of   the   National   Identification\n\nAuthority   of   India   for   the   purpose   of   issuing\n\nidentification   numbers   to   individuals   residing   in\n\nIndia   and   to   certain   other   classes   of   individuals,\n\nmanner   of   authentication   of   such   individuals   to\n\nfacilitate   access   to   benefits   and   services   to   which\n\nthey are entitled and for matters connected therewith\n\nor   incidental   thereto   was   introduced.     The   Bill   was\n\npending in the Parliament when the first Writ Petition\n\ni.e. Writ Petition (C) No. 494 of 2012 – Justice K.S.\n\nPuttaswamy   (Retd.)   &\nAnr.   Vs.   Union   of   India   &   Ors.\n\nWas\nfiled.     The   Writ   Petition   under\nArticle   32\nwas\n\nfiled   on   the   ground   that   fundamental   rights   of   the\n\ninnumerable citizens of India namely Right to Privacy\n\nfalling under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India\n\nare adversely affected by the Executive action of the\n\nCentral   Government   proceeding   to   implement   an\n\nExecutive   order   dated   28.01.2009   and   thereby   issuing\n\nAadhaar   numbers   to   both   citizens   as   also   illegal\nimmigrants   presently   illegally   residing   in   the\n\ncountry.     While   the   Bill   namely   “National\n\nIdentification   Authority   of   India   Bill,   2010”,   which\n\nhad   already   been   introduced   in   the   Rajya   Sabha   on\n\n03.12.2010 and referred to the Standing Committee, had\n\nbeen rejected.  The Writ Petition prayed for following\n\nreliefs:­\n\n(A) ISSUE   a   writ   in   the   nature   of   mandamus\n\nrestraining   the   respondents   Nos.   1  to   3\n\nfrom   issuing   Aadhaar   Numbers   by   way   of\nimplementing   its   Executive   order   dated\n28.01.2009   (Annexure   “P­1”)   which\ntentamount to implementing the provisions\nof the National Identification Authority\nof   India   Bill,   2010   pending   before   the\nParliament until and unless the said Bill\nis   considered   and   passed   by   the\nParliament   and   becomes   an   Act   of\nParliament.\n\n(B) Pass   such   other   order/s   as   this   Hon'ble\nCourt   may   deem   fit   and   proper   in   the\ncircumstances of the case.\n\n7.

A Constitution Bench of five Judges on 15.10.2015\n\npassed an order after hearing application filed by the\n\nUnion   of   India   for   seeking   certain\n\nclarification/modification   in   the   earlier   order   dated\n\n11.08.2015,   part   of   order,   which   is   relevant   for   the\n\npresent case is as follows:\n\n“3.   After   hearing   the   learned   Attorney\nGeneral   for   India   and   other   learned   senior\ncounsels,   we   are   of   the   view   that   in\nparagraph 3 of the Order dated 11.08.2015, if\nwe   add,   apart   from   the   other   two   Schemes,\nnamely,   P.D.S.   Scheme   and   the   L.P.G.\nDistribution   Scheme,   the   Schemes   like   The\nMahatma   Gandhi   National   Rural   Employment\nGuarantee   Scheme   12   (MGNREGS),   National\nSocial   Assistance   Programme   (Old   Age\nPensions,   Widow   Pensions,   Disability\nPensions)   Prime   Minister’s   Jan   Dhan   Yojana\n(PMJDY)   and   Employees’   Provident   Fund\nOrganisation (EPFO) for the present, it would\nnot   dilute   earlier   order   passed   by   this\nCourt.   Therefore,   we   now   include   the\naforesaid   Schemes   apart   from   the   other   two\nSchemes that this Court has permitted in its\nearlier order dated 11.08.2015.\n\n5.   We   will   also   make   it   clear   that   the\nAadhaar   card   Scheme   is   purely   voluntary   and\nit   cannot   be   made   mandatory   till   the   matter\nis   finally  decided   by  this   Court   one  way   or\nthe other.”\n\n24. A three­Judge Bench of this Court in its reference\n\norder dated 11.08.2015 noticed that these cases raise\n\nfar­reaching   questions   of   importance,   which   involves\n\ninterpretation   of   the   Constitution.   Two   earlier\n\ndecisions   of   this   Court,   i.e.,\nM.P.   Sharma   &   Others\n\nVs. Satish Chandra & Others\n, 1954 AIR SC 300, rendered\n\nby eight Judges and another judgment rendered by six­\n\nJudges   Bench  in\nKharak   Singh   Vs.   State   of   U.P.   &\n\nOthers\n,   AIR   1963   SC   1295  were   noticed   and   it   was\n\nobserved   that   in   the   event   the   observations   made   in\n\nthe above two judgments are to be read literally and\n\naccepted   as   the   law   of   this   country,   the   fundamental\n\nrights guaranteed under the Constitution of India and\n\nmore   particularly   right   to   liberty   under\nArticle   21\n\nwould   be   denuded   of   vigour   and   vitality.\n\nThe   three­\nJudge Bench observed that to give quietus to the kind\n\nof controversy raised in this batch of cases once for\n\nall,   it   is   better   that   the   ratio   decidendi   of\nM.P.\n\nSharma\n(supra) and\nKharak Singh\n(supra) is scrutinized\n\nand the jurisprudential correctness of the subsequent\n\ndecisions of this Court where the right to privacy is\n\neither   asserted   or   referred   be   examined   and\n\nauthoritatively   decided   by   a   Bench   of   appropriate\n\nstrength.\n\n25. By   order   dated   18.07.2017,   a   Constitution   Bench\n\nconsidered   it appropriate   that   the   issue   be   resolved\n\nby  a  Bench  of Nine  Judge. Following order was passed\n\non 18.07.2017 by a Constitution Bench:\n\n“During the course of the hearing today,\nit seems that it has become essential for us\nto determine whether there is any fundamental\nright   of   privacy   under   the   Indian\nConstitution.   The   determination   of   this\nquestion would essentially entail whether the\ndecision   recorded   by   this   Court   in\nM.P.\nSharma and Ors. vs. Satish Chandra, District\nMagistrate, Delhi and Ors.\n­ 1950 SCR 1077 by\nan   eight­Judge Constitution  Bench,   and   also,\nin\nKharak   Singh   vs.   The State   of   U.P.   and\nOrs.\n­   1962   (1)   SCR   332   by   a   six­Judge\nConstitution   Bench,   that   there   is   no   such\nfundamental  right,   is   the   correct   expression\nof the constitutional position.\nBefore   dealing   with   the   matter   any\nfurther,   we   are   of   the   view   that   the   issue\nnoticed   hereinabove   deserves   to   be   placed\nbefore   the   nine­Judge   Constitution   Bench.\nList   these   matters   before   the   Nine­Judge\nConstitution Bench on 19.07.2017.\n\nLiberty is granted to the learned counsel\nappearing   for   the   rival   parties   to   submit\ntheir written briefs in the meantime.”\n\n26. A nine­Judge Constitution Bench proceeded to hear\n\nand   decide   all   aspects   of   right   of   privacy   as\n\ncontained in the Constitution of India.\n\n27. Dr.   D.Y.   Chandrachud   delivered   opinion   on   his\n\nbehalf  as well  as on behalf of  Khehar, CJ., Agrawal,\n\nJ.   and   Nazeer,   J.   Jasti   Chelameswar,   J.,   Bobde,   J.,\n\nSapre, J. and Kaul, J. also delivered concurring, but\n\nseparate opinions. The opinion of all the nine Judges\n\ndelivered in above cases held that right of privacy is\n\na right which is constitutionally protected and it is\n\na   part   of   protection   guaranteed   under\nArticle   21\nof\n\nthe   Constitution   of   India.     Explaining   the   essential\n\nnature   of   privacy,   Dr.   D.Y.   Chandrachud,   J.   in\n\nparagraphs 297 and 298 laid down following:\n\n“297. What, then, does privacy postulate?\nPrivacy   postulates   the   reservation   of   a\nprivate   space   for   the   individual,   described\nas the right to be let alone. The concept is\nfounded   on   the   autonomy   of   the   individual.\nThe ability of an individual to make choices\nlies   at   the   core   of   the   human   personality.\nThe notion of privacy enables the individual\nto assert and control the human element which\nis   inseparable   from   the   personality   of   the\nindividual.   The   inviolable   nature   of   the\nhuman   personality   is   manifested   in   the\nability to make decisions on matters intimate\nto human life. The autonomy of the individual\nis associated over matters which can be kept\nprivate. These are concerns over which there\nis   a   legitimate   expectation   of   privacy.   The\nbody and the mind are inseparable elements of\nthe   human   personality.   The   integrity   of   the\nbody  and   the  sanctity  of  the   mind  can  exist\non   the   foundation   that   each   individual\npossesses an inalienable ability and right to\npreserve   a   private   space   in   which   the   human\npersonality  can  develop.   Without   the   ability\nto   make   choices,   the   inviolability   of   the\npersonality would be in doubt. Recognising a\nzone of privacy is but an acknowledgment that\neach individual must be entitled to chart and\npursue   the   course   of   development   of\npersonality. Hence privacy is a postulate of\nhuman   dignity   itself.   Thoughts   and\nbehavioural patterns which are intimate to an\nindividual are entitled to a zone of privacy\nwhere one is free of social expectations. In\nthat   zone   of   privacy,   an   individual   is   not\njudged   by   others.   Privacy   enables   each\nindividual   to   take   crucial   decisions   which\nfind expression in the human personality. It\nenables   individuals   to   preserve   their\nbeliefs,   thoughts,   expressions,   ideas,\nideologies,   preferences   and   choices   against\nsocietal   demands   of   homogeneity.   Privacy   is\nan intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of\nthe   right   of   the   individual   to   be   different\nand   to   stand   against   the   tide   of   conformity\nin   creating   a   zone   of   solitude.   Privacy\nprotects   the   individual   from   the   searching\nglare   of   publicity   in   matters   which   are\npersonal to his or her life. Privacy attaches\nto the person and not to the place where it\nis   associated.   Privacy   constitutes   the\nfoundation   of   all   liberty   because   it   is   in\nprivacy   that   the   individual   can   decide   how\nliberty is best exercised. Individual dignity\nand   privacy   are   inextricably   linked   in   a\npattern   woven   out   of   a   thread   of   diversity\ninto the fabric of a plural culture.\n\n298.  Privacy   of   the   individual   is   an\nessential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both\nan   intrinsic   and   instrumental   value.   As   an\nintrinsic   value,   human   dignity   is   an\nentitlement   or   a   constitutionally   protected\ninterest   in   itself.   In   its   instrumental\nfacet,   dignity   and   freedom   are   inseparably\nintertwined,   each   being   a   facilitative   tool\nto   achieve   the   other.   The   ability   of   the\nindividual   to   protect   a   zone   of   privacy\nenables the realisation of the full value of\nlife   and   liberty.   Liberty   has   a   broader\nmeaning   of   which   privacy   is   a   subset.   All\nliberties   may   not   be   exercised   in   privacy.\n\nYet   others   can   be   fulfilled   only   within   a\nprivate space. Privacy enables the individual\nto retain the autonomy of the body and mind.\n\nThe autonomy of the individual is the ability\nto make decisions on vital matters of concern\nto   life.   Privacy  has   not  been  couched  as   an\nindependent  fundamental  right.   But   that  does\nnot   detract   from   the   constitutional\nprotection   afforded   to   it,   once   the   true\nnature   of   privacy   and   its   relationship   with\nthose   fundamental   rights   which   are   expressly\nprotected   is   understood.   Privacy   lies   across\nthe   spectrum   of   protected   freedoms.   The\nguarantee of equality is a guarantee against\narbitrary State action. It prevents the State\nfrom   discriminating   between   individuals.   The\ndestruction   by   the   State   of   a   sanctified\npersonal space whether of the body or of the\nmind   is   violative   of   the   guarantee   against\narbitrary   State   action.   Privacy   of   the   body\nentitles   an   individual   to   the   integrity   of\nthe   physical   aspects   of   personhood.   The\nintersection   between   one’s   mental   integrity\nand   privacy   entitles   the   individual   to\nfreedom of thought, the freedom to believe in\nwhat   is   right,   and   the   freedom   of   self­\ndetermination.   When   these   guarantees\nintersect with gender, they create a private\nspace which protects all those elements which\nare   crucial   to   gender   identity.   The   family,\nmarriage,   procreation   and   sexual   orientation\nare   all   integral   to   the   dignity   of   the\nindividual.   Above   all,   the   privacy   of   the\nindividual   recognises   an   inviolable  right   to\ndetermine how freedom shall be exercised. An\nindividual may perceive that the best form of\nexpression   is   to   remain   silent.   Silence\npostulates   a   realm   of   privacy.   An   artist\nfinds   reflection   of   the   soul   in   a   creative\nendeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of\na process of thought. A musician contemplates\nupon   notes   which   musically   lead   to   silence.\n\nThe   silence,   which   lies   within,   reflects   on\nthe ability to choose how to convey thoughts\nand ideas or interact with others. These are\ncrucial   aspects   of   personhood.   The   freedoms\nunder\nArticle   19\ncan   be   fulfilled   where   the\nindividual is entitled to decide upon his or\nher   preferences.   Read   in   conjunction   with\n\nArticle 21\n, liberty enables the individual to\nhave   a   choice   of   preferences   on   various\nfacets   of   life   including   what   and   how   one\nwill  eat,  the  way  one  will  dress,  the  faith\none   will   espouse   and   a   myriad   other   matters\non   which   autonomy   and   self­determination\nrequire   a   choice   to   be   made   within   the\nprivacy of the mind. The constitutional right\nto   the   freedom   of   religion   under\nArticle   25\n\nhas implicit within it the ability to choose\na   faith   and   the   freedom   to   express   or   not\nexpress those choices to the world. These are\nsome   illustrations   of   the   manner   in   which\nprivacy  facilitates  freedom  and  is   intrinsic\nto the exercise of liberty. The Constitution\ndoes   not   contain   a   separate   article   telling\nus   that   privacy   has   been   declared   to   be   a\nfundamental   right.   Nor   have   we   tagged   the\nprovisions of Part III with an alpha­suffixed\nright   to   privacy:   this   is   not   an   act   of\njudicial   redrafting.   Dignity   cannot   exist\nwithout   privacy.   Both   reside   within   the\ninalienable   values   of   life,   liberty   and\nfreedom   which   the   Constitution   has\nrecognised.   Privacy   is   the   ultimate\nexpression of the sanctity of the individual.\nIt is a constitutional value which straddles\nacross the spectrum of fundamental rights and\nprotects for the individual a zone of choice\nand self­determination.”\n\n28. Privacy has been held to be an intrinsic element\n\nof   the   right   to   life   and   personal   liberty   Under\n\nArticle   21\nand   has   a   constitutional   value   which   is\n\nembodied in the fundamental freedoms embedded in Part\n\nIII of the Constitution. It was further held that like\n\nthe   right   to   life   and   liberty,   privacy   is   not\n\nabsolute.   The   limitations   which   operate   on   the   right\n\nto   life   and   personal   liberty   would   operate   on   the\n\nright   to   privacy.   Any   curtailment   or   deprivation   of\n\nthat right would have to take place under a regime of\nlaw.   The   procedure   established   by   law   must   be   fair,\n\njust and reasonable.\n\n29. The nine­Judge Constitution Bench also noticed the\n\ncontext   of   right   of   privacy   under   the   international\n\ncovenants.   The   protection   of   right   of   privacy   as\n\ndeveloped   in   U.K.   decision, decisions   of   US   Supreme\n\nCourt,   constitutional   right   to   privacy   in   South\n\nAfrica,   constitutional   right   to   privacy   in   Canada,\n\nprivacy under European convention on human rights and\n\nunder Charter of fundamental rights of European Union\n\nwere considered with reference to decision rendered by\n\nforeign courts.\n\n30. Justice   D.Y.   Chandradhud   in   his   judgment   traced\n\nthe right of privacy from the judgments of this Court\n\nwhich   were   rendered   for   the   last   five   decades.\n\nReferring   to   International   Law   on   the   subject,\n\nfollowing   observations   were   made   by   Justice     D.Y.\n\nChandradhud, J.:\n\n“103...In   the   view   of   this   Court,\ninternational   law   has   to   be   construed   as   a\npart   of   domestic   law   in   the   absence   of\nlegislation to the contrary and, perhaps more\nsignificantly,   the   meaning   of   constitutional\nguarantees must be illuminated by the content\nof   international   conventions   to   which   India\nis   a   party.   Consequently,   as   new   cases\nbrought   new   issues   and   problems   before   the\nCourt,   the   content   of   the   right   to   privacy\nhas   found   elaboration   in   these   diverse\ncontexts.”\n\n31. All contours of the right of privacy having been\n\nnoticed   with   all   its   dimensions,   precautions   and\n\nsafeguards to be applied to protect fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed   under   the   Constitution   of   India,   we   while\n\nproceeding to decide the issues raised herein have to\n\nproceed in the light of nine­Judge Constitution Bench\n\nof this Court as noticed above.\n\n32. We   have   been   manifestly   benefited   by   able   and\n\nelaborate submissions raised before us by many eminent\n\nlearned senior counsel appearing for both the parties.\n\nLearned   counsel   for   both   the   parties   have   advanced\n\ntheir submissions with clarity, conviction and lot of\n\npersuasions.   On   occasions   very   passionate   arguments\n\nwere advanced to support the respective submissions.\n33. Different aspects of the case have been taken up\n\nand advanced by different counsel as per understanding\n\nbetween   them   which   enlightened   the   Court   on   varied\n\naspects   of   the   case.   The   submissions   have   been\n\nadvanced   on   behalf   of   the   petitioners   by   learned\n\nsenior Advocates, namely, Shri Kapil Sibal, Shri Gopal\n\nSubramanium,   Shri   P.   Chidambaram,   Shri   Shyam   Divan,\n\nShri   K.V.   Viswanathan,   Shri Neeraj   Kishan   Kaul,   Ms.\n\nMeenakshi   Arora,   Shri   C.U.   Singh,   Shri   Anand   Grover,\n\nShri   Sanjay   R.   Hegde,   Shri   Arvind   P.   Datar,   Shri\n\nV.Giri,   Shri   Sajan   Poovayya   and   Shri   P.V.   Surendra\n\nNath.     A large number of other counsel also assisted\n\nus including Mr. Gopal Sankaranarayanan. On behalf of\n\nrespondents arguments were led by the learned Attorney\n\nGeneral, Shri K.K. Venugopal. We have also heard Shri\n\nTushar   Mehta,   Additional   Solicitor   General,   Shri\n\nRakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel and Shri Zohaib\n\nHossain.\n\n34. We   also   permitted   Dr.   Ajay   B.   Pandey,   Chief\n\nExecutive Officer, UIDAI to give a power presentation\nto   explain   actual   working   of the   system.   After   the\n\npower presentation was presented by Dr. Pandey in the\n\npresence   of   the   learned   counsel   for   the   parties,\n\nlearned   counsel   have   also   thereafter   raised   certain\n\nquestions in respect of the power presentation, which\n\nthe   respondents   during   submissions   have   tried   to\n\nexplain. In view of the enormity of submissions raised\n\nby   the   different   learned   counsel   appearing   for   the\n\npetitioners,   we   proceed   to   notice   different   part   of\n\nsubmissions   together.   As   noted   above   writ   petitions\n\nhave   been   filed   at   two   stages,   firstly,   when   UIDAI\n\nScheme   was   being   impleaded   by   the   Executive   order\n\ndated 28.01.2009. Secondly, challenge was raised when\n\nAct,   2016   was   enacted.   The   challenge   to   the   Scheme\n\ndated   24.01.2009   contained   almost   same   grounds   on\n\nwhich   Act,   2016   has   been   attacked.   Additional   ground\n\nto   challenge   the   Scheme   was   that   Scheme   having   not\n\nbeen   backed   by   law,   the   entire   exercise   was\n\nunconstitutional   and   violative   of   fundamental   rights\n\nguaranteed   under   the   Constitution   of   India   and\n\ndeserved to be set aside. The Act, 2016 having enacted\nand now statutory scheme  is in place, we  shall  first\n\nproceed   to   notice   the   submissions   attacking   the   Act,\n\n2016   which   challenge   has   been   substantial   and\n\nelaborately raised before us.\n\nPetitioner's Submissions\n\n35. The   submissions   advanced   by   different   learned\n\ncounsel   for   the   petitioners   instead   of   noticing\n\nindividually   are   being   noted   together   in   seriatim,\n\nwhich are as follows:­\n\n36. The   Aadhaar   project   initiated   by   Executive\n\nnotification dated 28.01.2009 as well as impugned Act,\n\n2016   violates\nArticle   21.\nThe   constitutional   rights\n\nof a person protected under\nArticles 19\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution is violated as individuals are compelled\n\nto   part   with   their   demographic   and   biometric\n\ninformation   at   the   point   of   collection.     Biometric\n\ndata is part of one's body and control over one's body\n\nlies   on   the   very   centre   of   the   Right   of   Privacy.\n\nDecisional   privacy   allows   individual   to   make   a\ndecision   about   their   own   body   and   is   an   aspect   of\n\nright   of   self­determination.     The   Aadhaar   Project\n\nincluding   the   Aadhaar   Act   violate   the   informational\n\nprivacy.     Data   collection   at   the   enrolment   centres,\n\nthe   Data   retention   at   Central   Identities   Data\n\nRepositories   (CIDR),   usage   and   sharing   of   data\n\nviolates Right of Privacy.   There is complete absence\n\nof   safeguards   at   the   stage   of   collection,   retention\n\nand   use   of   data.     Act,   2016   and   Regulations   framed\n\nthereunder   lack   safeguards   to   secure   sensitive\n\npersonal data of a person.\n\n37. The Aadhaar project including Act, 2016 creates an\n\narchitecture   for   pervasive   surveillance,   which   again\n\nviolate   fundamental   Right   to   Privacy.     Personal   data\n\ncollected under the Executive scheme dated 28.01.2009\n\nwas   without   any   individual's   consent.\nThe   Act,   2016\n\nalthough   contemplate   that   enrolment   under   Aadhaar   is\n\nvoluntary but in actual working of the Act, it becomes\n\ndefacto compulsory.\nThe  Act, 2016\ndoes not pass the\n\nthree­fold  test as\nlaid down by\nNine Judges Bench in\nPrivacy Judgment ­\nK.S. Puttaswamy Vs. Union of India\n,\n\n(2017)   10   SCC   1,  hereinafter   referred   to   as\n\n“Puttaswamy   case”.    The   Three­fold   test\nlaid   down   in\n\nPuttaswamy's case are:­\n\n(i)  legality,   which   postulates   the\n\nexistence of law;\n\n(ii)  need, defined in terms of a legitimate\n\nstate aim; and\n\n(iii)  proportionality   which   ensures   a\n\nrational nexus between the objects and\n\nthe means adopted to achieve them;\n\n38. It is submitted that a law to pass under\nArticle\nshould be a law according to procedure established\n\nby   law.\nThe   Act,   2016\nviolates   both\nArticle   14\nand\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India.  A legitimate\n\nState aim, which ensure that nature and content of the\n\nlaw,   which   imposes   the   restriction   falls   within   the\n\nreasonable restrictions mandated by\nArticle 14\nis also\n\nnot fulfilled.   State has not been  able to  discharge\n\nits burden that Aadhaar project has been launched for\na legitimate State aim.   The third requirement, which\n\nrequire   that   the   means   that   are   adopted   by   the\n\nlegislature   are   proportional   to   the   object   sought   to\n\nbe   fulfilled   by   the   law   is   also   not   fulfilled   since\n\nthe   provisions   of   the   Act   and   Regulations   framed\n\nthereunder does not satisfy the Proportionality Test.\n\nThe   various   provisions   of   Act,   2016   and   Regulations\n\nframed thereunder are unconstitutional.\nSection 6\nof\n\nthe   Act,   2016   is   unconstitutional   inasmuch   as   it\n\nenable the respondents to continually compel residents\n\nto   periodically   furnish   demographic   and   biometric\n\ninformation.\nSection   7\nof   the   Act,   2016   is\n\nunconstitutional   inasmuch   as   it   seeks   to   render   the\n\nconstitutional and statutory obligations of the State\n\nto   provide   benefits,   subsidies   and   services,\n\nconditional   upon   an   individual   bartering   his   or   her\n\nbiometric   and   demographic   information.\nSection   8\nis\n\nunconstitutional   since   it   enables   tracking,   tagging\n\nand   profiling   of   individuals   through   the\n\nauthentication process.\nSection 8\ndelineate a regime\n\nof   surveillance,   which   enables persons'   physical\nmovements to be traced.\nSection 9\nof the Act, 2016 is\n\nalso   unconstitutional   inasmuch   as   the   Aadhaar   number\n\nis   de   facto   serving   as   proof   of   citizenship   and\n\ndomicile.     The   provisions   of   Chapter   IV,   i.e.,\n\nSections   11\nto\nare   ultra   vires   and\n\nunconstitutional.   The   Constitution   does   not   permit\n\nthe establishment of an authority that in turn through\n\nan   invasive   programme   can   claim   every   Indian\n\ncitizen/resident   to   a   central   data   bank   and   maintain\n\nlifelong   records   and   logs   of   that   individual.\n\nSections   23\nand\nof   the   Act,   2016   are   also\n\nunconstitutional   on   the   ground   of   excessive\n\ndelegation.\nSection   29\nof   the   Act,   2016   is   also\n\nliable   to   be   struck   down   inasmuch   as   it   permits\n\nsharing   of   identity   information.\nSection   33\nis\n\nunconstitutional   inasmuch   as   it   provides   for   the   use\n\nof   the   Aadhaar   data   base   for   police   investigation\n\npursuant to an order of a competent court.\nSection 33\n\nviolates   the   protection   against   self­incrimination   as\n\nenshrined   under\nArticle   20(3)\nof   the   Constitution   of\n\nIndia.     Furthermore,\nSection   33\ndoes   not   afford   an\nopportunity   of   hearing   to   the   concerned   individual\n\nwhose   information   is   sought   to   be   released   by   the\n\nUIDAI pursuant to the court's order.  This is contrary\n\nto  the principles of  natural justice.\nSection 47\nis\n\nalso unconstitutional inasmuch as it does not allow an\n\nindividual citizen who finds that there is a violation\n\nof   the   Act,   2016   to   initiate   the   criminal   process.\n\nSection   48\n,   which   empowers   the   Central   Government   to\n\nsupersede UIDAI is vague and arbitrary.\n\n39. Elaborating   submission   with   regard   to\nSection   7\n,\n\nit is submitted that\nSection 7\nis unconstitutional and\n\nviolative   of\nArticle   14\nmaking   Aadhaar   mandatory,\n\nwhich   has   no   nexus   with   the   subsidies,   benefits   and\n\nservices.  A person cannot be forced into parting with\n\nsensitive   personal   information   as   a   condition   for\n\navailing   benefits   or   services.\nSection   7\nalso   falls\n\nfoul   of\nArticle   14\nsince   firstly   such   mandatory\n\nauthentication   has   caused,   and   continues   to   cause,\n\nexclusion   of   the   most   marginalised   sections   of\n\nsociety; and secondly, this exclusion is not simply a\n\nquestion   of   poor   implementation   that   can   be\nadministratively   resolved,   but   stems   from   the   very\n\ndesign   of   the   Act,   i.e.   the   use   of   biometric\n\nauthentication   as   the   primary   method   of\n\nidentification. There is large scale exclusion to the\n\nmostly marginalised society not being able to identify\n\nthemselves   by   identification   process.     There   is\n\nsufficient   material   on   record   to   indicate   general\n\ndeprivation, which itself is sufficient to struck down\n\nSection 7\nof the Act.\n\n40. Elaborating   submission   on   unconstitutionality   of\n\nSection 57\n, it is contended that\nSection 57\nallows an\n\nunrestricted   extension   of   the   Aadhaar   information   to\n\nusers who may be Government agencies or private sector\n\noperators.\nSection   57\nenables   commercial   exploitation\n\nof   an   individual's   biometrics   and   demographic\n\ninformation   by   the   respondents   as   well   as   private\n\nentities.   The   provision   also   ensures   creation   of   a\n\nsurveillance   society,   where   every   entity   assists   the\n\nState   to   snoop   upon   an   Aadhaar   holder.     The   use   of\n\nAadhaar   infrastructure   by   private   entities   is\n\nunconstitutional.\n41. Elaborating   submissions   on\nSection   59\n,   it   is\n\ncontended that\nSection 59\nis unconstitutional inasmuch\n\nas  it seeks to validate all action  undertaken by the\n\nCentral Government pursuant to the notification dated\n\n28.01.2009.     Enrolment   in   pursuance   of   notification\n\ndated 28.01.2009 having been done without an informed\n\nconsent   amounts   to   deprivation   of   the   intimate\n\npersonal   information   of   an   individual   violating   the\n\nfundamental   Right   of   Privacy.     All   steps   taken   under\n\nthe   notification   dated   28.01.2009   were   not   backed   by\n\nany   law,   hence   unconstitutional   and   clearly   violate\n\nArticle   21,   which   cannot   be   cured   in   a   manner   as\n\nSection 59 pretend to do.\n\n42.\nThe Act\nis unconstitutional since it collects the\n\nidentify   information   of   children   between   five   to\n\neighteen years without parental consent.   The Aadhaar\n\narchitecture   adopts   foreign   technologies,   on   which\n\nUIDAI   does   not   have   any   control,   exposing   data   leak\n\nendangering life of people and security of nation.\n\n43. Rule   9   as   amended   by   PMLA   Rules,   2017   is\nunconstitutional   being   violative   of\nArticles   14\n,\n\n19(1)(g)\n,   21\nand\n300A\nof   the   Constitution   of   India.\n\nRule 9 also violates\nSections 3\n,\nand\nof the Act,\n\n2016   and   ultra   vires   to   the   provisions   of\nPMLA   Act,\n.\n\n44.\nSection   139AA\nof   the   Income   Tax   Act,   1961   is\n\nliable to be struck down as violative of\nArticles 14\n,\n\n19(1)(g)\nand\nof the Constitution in view of Privacy\n\nJudgment –\nPuttaswamy\n(supra).\n\n45. The   Mobile   Linking   Circular   dated   23.03.2017\n\nissued   by   Ministry   of   Communications,   Department   of\n\nTelecommunications is ultra vires.\n\n46.\nThe Aadhaar Act, 2016\nhas wrongly been passed as a\n\nMoney   Bill.\nThe   Aadhaar   Act,   2016\nis   not   a   Money\n\nBill.   The   Speaker   of   Lok   Sabha   wrongly   certified   the\n\nbill   as   a   Money   Bill   under\nArticle   110\nof   the\n\nConstitution   of   India   virtually   excluding   the   Rajya\n\nSabha   from   legislative   process   and   depriving   the\n\nHon'ble   President   of   his   power   of   return.   Clauses\n\n23(2)(g),\nSection   54(2)(m)\nand\nSection   57\nof   The\nAadhaar     (Targeted   Delivery   of   Financial   and   Other\n\nSubsidies,   Benefits   and   Services)   Bill,   2016   and   the\n\ncorresponding   Sections   of   the   Act,   2016   as   notified\n\nclearly   do   not   fall   under   any   of   the   Clauses   of\n\nArticle 110\nof  the Constitution.\nThe Act\nof Speaker\n\ncertifying   the   bill   as   a   Money   Bill   is   clearly\n\nviolation   of   constitutional   provisions.     Judicial\n\nReview   of   decision   of   Speaker   certifying   it   as   Money\n\nBill   is   permissible   on   the   ground   of   illegality.   The\n\nAadhaar   Bill   being   not   a   money   bill   and   having   been\n\npassed   by   Parliament   as   a   Money   Bill,   this   ground\n\nalone   is   sufficient   to   strike   down   the   entire   Act,\n\n2016.\n\n47. Learned   Attorney   General   replying   the   above\n\nsubmissions   of   the   counsel   for   the   petitioners\n\nsubmits:­\n\n48.\nIn   the\nPrivacy   Judgment  P.S.   Puttaswamy\ncase\n\n(supra)  all nine Judges uniformly agreed that privacy\n\nis   a   fundamental   right   traceable   to   the   right   to\n\nliberty under\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution and hence\nsubject   to   the   same   limitations   as   applicable   to   the\n\nsaid Article. It has  further been held  that right of\n\nprivacy is not absolute and is subject to limitations.\n\nJustice   D.Y.   Chandrachud   in   his   lead   judgment   laid\n\ndown   that   following   three   tests   are   required   to   be\n\nsatisfied   for   judging   the   permissible   limits   of   the\n\ninvasion   of   privacy   under\nArticle   21\nof   the\n\nConstitution:\n\n(a)  The existence of a law\n\n(b) A legitimate State interest; and\n\n(c) The said Law should pass the test of\nproportionality.\n\n49. The   above   tests   have   also   been   agreed   by   other\n\nJudges   who   have   delivered   the   separate   judgment.\n\nJustice   J.   Chelameswar   and   Justice   A.N.   Sapre   have\n\nused   the   test   of   compelling   State   interest   whereas\n\nJustice   R.F.   Nariman   stated   that   if   this   test   is\n\napplied, the  result is that one would be  entitled to\n\ninvoke   larger   public   interest   in   lieu   of   legitimate\n\nState   aim.   The   legitimate   State   aim   obviously   will\n\nlead   to   public   interest,   hence   in   the   event   test   of\nlegitimate State aim is fulfilled, the test of public\n\ninterest   stands   fulfilled.   After   enactment   of   Act,\n\n2016,   the   first   condition   in   regard   to   the   existence\n\nof  a  law stands satisfied.\nThe Act\nrequires only the\n\nbare   demographic   particulars,   while   eschewing   most\n\nother   demographic   particulars.\nThe   Act\nfurther\n\ncontains   adequate   safeguards   for   protection   of\n\ninformation   and   preventing   abuse   through   a   catena   of\n\noffences   and   penalties.   The   provisions   of   Act   ensure\n\nthat   the   law   is   a   just,   fair   and   reasonable   and   not\n\nfanciful, oppressive or arbitrary.\n\n50. The legitimate  State  interest  or  a larger  public\n\ninterest   permeates   through   the   Act,   2016   which   is\n\nclearly indicated by the following:\n\nA. Preventing   the   dissipation   of   subsidies\nand   social   welfare   benefits   which   is\ncovered by Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act;\n\nB. Prevention   of   black   money   and   money\nlaundering   by   imposing   a   requirement   by\nlaw for linking Aadhaar for opening bank\naccounts;\n\nC. To   prevent   income   tax   evasion   by\nrequiring,   through   an   amendment   to   the\n\nIncome   Tax   Act\n,   that   the   Aadhaar   number\nbe linked with the PAN; and\nD. To prevent terrorism and protect national\nsecurity   by   requiring   that   Aadhaar   be\nlinked to SIM cards for mobile phones.”\n\n51.\nThe Aadhaar Act,  2016\nwas  enacted  with  prolonged\n\ndeliberations   and   study.   The   petitioners   have   failed\n\nto   establish   any   arbitrariness   in   the   Act.   The   right\n\nto   life   under\nArticle   21\nis   not   the   right   to   a   mere\n\nanimal   existence,   but   the   right   to   live   with   human\n\ndignity   which   would   include   the   right   to   food,   the\n\nright   to   shelter,   the   right   to   employment,   the   right\n\nto   medical   care,   education   etc.   If   these   rights   are\n\njuxtaposed   against   the   right   to   privacy,   the   former\n\nwill   and   prevail   over   the   latter.   In   so   far   as\n\nimplementation of Aadhaar project prior to coming into\n\nforce of Act, 2016,  since obtaining an Aadhaar number\n\nor   an   enrolment   number   was   voluntary,   especially\n\nbecause of the interim orders passed by this Court, no\n\nissue   of   violation   of   any   right,   leave   alone   a\n\nfundamental right, could arise. The judgments of this\n\nCourt   in\nM.P.   Sharma   and   Kharak   Singh\n(supra)  being\n\nthose   of   eight   Judges   and   six   Judges   respectively,\n\nholding that the right to privacy is not a fundamental\nright,   the   judgments   of   smaller   benches   delivered\n\nduring the period upto 2016 would be  per incuriam, as\n\na result of which the State need not to have proceeded\n\non the basis that a law was required for the purpose\n\nof   getting   an   Aadhaar   number   or   an   enrolment   number.\n\nAs   a   result,   the   Executive   instructions   issued   for\n\nthis purpose would be valid as well as the receipt of\n\nbenefits   and   subsidies   by   the   beneficiaries.   In   any\n\nview of the matter,\nSection 59\nof the Act protects all\n\nactions taken during the period 2010 until the passing\n\nof the Aadhaar Act in 2016.\n\n52. Learned   Attorney   General   submitted   that   Aadhaar\n\nAct   has   rightly   been   characterised   as   Money   Bill   as\n\nunderstood under\nArticle 110\nof the Constitution. The\n\nheart of the Aadhaar Act is\nSection 7\n. It is not the\n\ncreation of Aadhaar number per se which is the core of\n\nthe Act, rather, that is only a means to identify the\n\ncorrect   beneficiary   and   ensure   ‘targeted   delivery   of\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services’, the expenditure for\n\nwhich is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India.\nThe   decision   of   the   Speaker   incorporated   into   a\n\ncertificate sent to the President is final and cannot\n\nbe the subject matter of judicial review.\n\n53. The   decision   and   certification   of   the   Speaker\n\nbeing a matter of procedure is included in the Chapter\n\nunder   the   head   ‘Legislative   Procedure’   which   clearly\n\nexcluded   judicial   review.   The   present   issue   is\n\nsquarely covered by the decisions of this Court.\n\n54.\nSection   57\n,   which   has   been   attacked   as   being\n\nuntraceable to any of the sub­clauses of (a) to (f) of\n\nArticle 110\ncannot be looked at in isolation. The Bill\n\nin   its   pith   and   substance   should   pass   the   test   of\n\nbeing a Money Bill and not isolated provisions.\n\n55. Learned   Additional   Solicitor   General   of   India,\n\nShri   Tushar   Mehta,   also   advanced   submissions   on   few\n\naspects of the matter. On\nSection 139AA\nof Income Tax\n\nAct, 1961 it is submitted that petitioners can succeed\n\nonly   when   they   demonstrate   that\nSection   139AA\nis\n\nviolative   of   right   to   privacy   on   the   following   tests\nas\nlaid   down   by\nnine­Judge   Constitution   Bench   in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase:\n\n(i) absence of a law;\n\n(ii) absence of legitimate State interest”\n\n(iii) provisions   being   hit   by   lack   of\nproportionality;\n(iv)  the   provisions   being   manifestly\narbitrary.\n\n56. It  is  submitted that  two­Judge  Bench  judgment  of\n\nthis   Court   in\nBinoy   Biswam   Vs.   Union   of   India   and\n\nothers\n,   (2017)   7   SCC   59,  had   upheld   the   vires   of\n\nSection   139AA\nsubject   to   issue   of   privacy   which   at\n\nthat   point   of   time   was   pending   consideration.   It   is\n\nfurther   submitted   that   provision   pertaining   to\n\nPermanent   Account   Number   (PAN)   was   inserted   in   the\n\nIncome   Tax   Act\nby\nSection   139A\nwith   effect   from\n\n01.04.1989 which obliged every person to quote PAN for\n\ndifferent purposes as enumerated in\nSection 139A\n. The\n\nPetitioners   or   anyone   else   never   felt   aggrieved   by\n\nrequirement   of   getting   PAN   under\nSection   139A\nand\n\nParliament   on   considering   the   legitimate   State\n\ninterest has introduced\nSection 139AA\nwhich is only an\nextension   of\nSection   139A\nwhich   requires   linking   of\n\nPAN with Aadhaar number.\n\n57.\nThe Income Tax Act\nwas amended by the Parliament\n\nby   inserting\nSection   139AA\nin   the   legitimate   State\n\ninterest and in larger public interest. The object of\n\nlinking was to remove bogus PAN cards by linking with\n\nAadhaar,   expose   shell   companies   and   thereby   curb   the\n\nmenace   of   black   money,   money   laundering   and   tax\n\nevasion.   Problem   of   multiple   PAN   cards   to   same\n\nindividuals   and   PAN   cards   in   the   name   of   fictitious\n\nindividuals are common medium of money laundering, tax\n\nevasion, creation and channeling of black money.\n\n58. Linking   of   Aadhaar   with   PAN   is   consistent   with\n\nIndia’s international obligations and Goals. India has\n\nsigned the Inter­Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the\n\nUSA on July, 9, 2015, for improving International Tax\n\nCompliance   and   implementing   the   Foreign   Account   Tax\n\nCompliance   Act.   It   is   submitted   that   prior   to\n\n01.07.2017   already   1.75   crore   tax   payers   had   linked\n\ntheir PAN with Aadhaar on a voluntary basis. Replying\nthe   arguments   based   on   the   interim   orders   passed   by\n\nthis   Court   in   the   present   group   of   petitions,   it   is\n\nsubmitted   that   enactment   of\nAadhaar   Act,   2016\nhas\n\ntaken   away   and   cured   the   basis   of   the   interim   order\n\npassed   by   this   Court   since   one   of   the   submissions\n\nwhich   was   made   before   this   Court   in   passing   the\n\ninterim orders was that there was no law, that Aadhaar\n\nproject   was   being   implemented   without   backing   of   any\n\nlaw and during the said period the interim orders were\n\npassed. The Aadhaar Act addresses the concern of this\n\nCourt as reflected in the interim orders passed before\n\nenactment of the Act.\n\n59. Shri   Mehta   further   contended   that   there   is\n\npresumption to the constitutionality of a statute and\n\nunless   one   attacking   the   statute   satisfies   the   Court\n\nthat  the statute is unconstitutional, the presumption\n\nwill   be   there   that   statute   is   constitutional.   Shri\n\nMehta   has   further   submitted   that   there   is   no\n\npresumption of criminality or guilt on the requirement\n\nto link Aadhaar.\n60. Elaborating   the   doctrine   of   proportionality,\n\nAdditional Solicitor General submits that\nSection 139A\n\nfully satisfies the aforesaid test of proportionality.\n\n61. Additional   Solicitor   General   in   support   of\n\nPrevention     of   Money­laundering   (Maintenance   of\n\nRecords) Second Amendment Rules, 2017 submits that the\n\nState has sought to make the  provisions of PMLA more\n\nrobust and ensure that the ultimate object of the Act\n\nis   achieved.   The   Amendment   Rules,   2017   place   an\n\nobligation on part of the reporting entity to seek the\n\ndetails with regard to Aadhaar number of every client.\n\nIt is submitted that the said Rules have to be read in\n\nconsonance   with   the   object   of   the   PMLA   and   the\n\nprinciples of “beneficial owner” behind the corporate\n\nveil of shell companies, etc. It is submitted that the\n\nPMLA   empowers   the   State   to   utilise   the   uniqueness   of\n\nAadhaar   in   order   to   tackle   the   problem   of   money\n\nlaundering. It is submitted that the\nPMLA Act\n, with a\n\nclear emphasis on the investigation of the biological\n\npersons   behind   the   corporate   entities,   establishes   a\n\nmechanism wherein receiving benefits through benami or\nshell   companies   through   related/connected   Directors,\n\nfictitious persons or other personnel is eliminated.\n\n62.\nSection 139AA\nand PMLA Rules amended in 2017 are\n\nco­ordinated   in   their   operation.   The   PMLA   Rules   are\n\nnot   ultra   vires.   Mr.   Mehta   has   also   referred   to\n\ninternational   Conventions   declaring   money   laundering\n\nto   be   a   very   serious   offence.   He   submits   that\n\nPrevention   of Money   Laundering   Act,   2002\nwas   enacted\n\nin   the   context   of   concrete   international   efforts   to\n\ntackle the menace of money laundering. Shri Mehta has\n\nalso   emphasised   on   the   necessity   of   verification   of\n\nbank accounts with Aadhaar number. He submits that the\n\nverification of bank account by way of Aadhaar is done\n\nfor the reason that often bank accounts are opened in\n\neither   fictitious   names   or   in   the   name   of   wrong\n\npersons on the basis of forged identity documents and\n\nfinancial   crimes   are   committed.   It   is   seen   that\n\naccommodation entries are mostly provided through the\n\nbanking   channels   by   bogus   companies   to   convert   black\n\nmoney   into   white.   Benami   transactions   routinely   take\n\nplace through banking channels. All of the above, can\nto a large extent be checked by verifying Aadhaar with\n\nbank   accounts   to   ensure   that   the   account   belongs   to\n\nthe   person   who   claims   to   be   the   account   holder   and\n\nthat   he   or   she   is   a   genuine   person.   Verification   of\n\nbank account with Aadhaar also ensures that the direct\n\nbenefit   transfer   of   subsidies   reach   the   Aadhaar\n\nverified   bank   account   and   is   not   diverted   to   some\n\nother account. Shell companies are often used to open\n\nbank   accounts   to   hold   unaccounted   money   of   other\n\nentities under fictitious identities   which will also\n\nbe curbed once Aadhaar verification is initiated.\n\n63. Shri   Mehta   further   contends   that   impugned   PMLA\n\nRules   do   not   violate\nArticle   300A.\nAmendment   Rules,\n\n2017   also   cannot   be   said   to   be   ultra   vires   to   the\n\nparent Act since it advances the object of the Act and\n\nis   not   ultra   vires   of   any   provision   of   the   Act.   The\n\nAmendment   Rules   are   required   to   be   placed   before   the\n\nParliament   which   serve   a   purpose   of   check   by   the\n\nLegislature.   As   per\nSection   159\nof   the   Act   any\n\nnotification   under\nSection   29\nis   to   be   placed   before\n\nthe Parliament and Parliament may amend or reject the\nsame.   The   Rules,   2017   are   just,   fair   and   reasonable\n\nand in furtherance of the object of the Act and do not\n\nprovide   for   any   arbitrary,   uncanalised   or   unbridled\n\npower.\n\n64. Shri   Rakesh   Dwivedi,   learned   senior   counsel,\n\nappearing on behalf of UIDAI and State of Gujarat has\n\nmade   elaborate   submissions   while   replying   the\n\narguments of petitioners. The right to privacy is part\n\nof\nArticle   21.\nThe   autonomy   of   individual   is\n\nassociated   over   matters   which   can   be   kept   private.\n\nThese   are   concerns   over   which   there   is   a   reasonable\n\nexpectation   of   privacy.   The   reasonable   expectation\n\ninvolves   two   aspects.   Firstly,   the   individual   or\n\nindividuals claiming a right to privacy must establish\n\nthat   their   claim   involves   a   concern   about   some   harm\n\nlikely   to   be   inflicted   upon   them   on   account   of   the\n\nalleged   act.   This   concern   should   be   real   and   not\n\nimaginary or speculative. Secondly, the concern should\n\nnot be inflated.\n65.\nThe   Act,   2016\noperates   in   the   relational   sphere\n\nand   not   in   the   core,   private   or   personal   sphere   of\n\nresidents.   It   involves   minimal   identity   information\n\nfor   effective   authentication.   The   purpose   is   limited\n\nto   authenticate   for   identification.\nThe   Act\noperates\n\nin   a   public   sphere.\nSection   29\nof   the   Aadhaar   Act,\n\n2016   provides   protection   against   disclosure   of\n\nidentity information without the prior consent of the\n\nAadhaar   Number   holder   concerned.   Sharing   is   intended\n\nonly for authentication purposes.\n\n66. It   is   submitted   that   by   their   very   nature   the\n\ndemographic   information   and   photograph   sought   to   be\n\ncollected   cannot   be   said   to   be   of   such   a   nature   as\n\nwould   make   it   a   part   of   a   reasonable   expectation\n\nparadigm.   Today,   globally   all   ID   cards   and   passports\n\ncontain   photographs   for   identification   along   with\n\naddress,   date   of   birth,   gender   etc.   The   demographic\n\ninformation   is   readily   provided   by   individuals\n\nglobally   for   disclosing   identity   while   relating   with\n\nothers;   while   seeking   benefits   whether   provided   by\n\ngovernment   or   by   private   entities.   People   who   get\nregistered   for   engaging   in   a   profession,   who   take\n\nadmissions   in   Schools/Colleges/university,   who   seek\n\nemployment   in the   government   or   private   concerns   and\n\nthose who engage in various trade and commerce are all\n\nrequired   to   provide   demographic   information   and   even\n\nphotographs.   There   is   no   expectation   of   privacy   in\n\nproviding those information for the above purposes.\n\n67. There   are   lot   of   enactments   which   require\n\ndisclosure of demographic information comprising name,\n\naddress, email address etc., for example Central Motor\n\nVehicle   Rules,   1989,\nCompanies   Act,   2013\n,\nSpecial\n\nMarriage   Act\n,   The   Registration   of   Electoral   Rules,\n\n1960,   The   Citizenship   (Registration   of   Citizens   and\n\nIssue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2009 and the\n\nPassports   Act\n.   However,   there   are   certain   special\n\ncontexts   in   which   non­disclosure   of   demographic\n\ninformation   could   be   considered   as   raising   a\n\nreasonable   expectation   of   privacy   such   as   where\n\njuveniles in conflict with law are involved or where a\n\nrape   victim’s   identity   or   medical   information   is\n\ninvolved.   Thus,   unless   some   such   special   context   or\naggravating factor is established, there would not be\n\nany reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to\n\ndemographic information.\n\n68. As   regards   the   core   biometric   information,\n\ncomprising   finger   prints   and   iris   scans   it   would   be\n\npertinent to bear in mind that the Aadhaar Act is not\n\ndealing   with   the   intimate   or private   sphere   of   the\n\nindividual.   The   core   biometrics   are   being   collected\n\nfrom   residents   for   authentication   use   in   a   public\n\nsphere and in relational context in which regard there\n\nis no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to\n\nfingerprints and iris scans. Iris scan is nothing but\n\na   photograph   of   the   eyes   taken   from   a   camera.   From\n\nfingerprints   and   iris   scans   nothing   is   revealed   with\n\nregard to a person.\n\n69. Use of fingerprints with regard to registration of\n\ndocuments   is   an   accepted   phenomena.   The   use   of\n\nmandatory   requirement   of   biometric   attendance   is\n\nincreasing   day   by   day   both   in   public   and   private\n\nsector.   Thus,   requirement   of   fingerprints   and   iris\nscan   would   not   attract   the   fundamental   right   of\n\nprivacy.   The   fingerprint   and   iris   scan   have   been\n\nconsidered   to be   most   accurate   and   non­invasive   mode\n\nof identifying an individual.\n\n70. The information collected under the Act, 2016 does\n\nnot   involve   processing   for   economic   and   sociological\n\npurposes.   Further,   in   the   data   center   de­duplication\n\nprocess   is   based   on   anonymization   and   what   is   stored\n\nin   the   servers   for   authentication   process   are   simply\n\ntemplates and encrypted information of Aadhaar number\n\nand   demographics.   The   identity   data   collected   is\n\nstored   offline.   There   is   no   internet   connectivity.\n\nThus,   there   is   more   than   a   reasonable   security\n\nprotection under the Act.\n\n71. The   rationale   of\nSection   7\nlies   in   ensuring\n\ntargeted delivery of services, benefits and subsidies\n\nwhich are funded from the Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nIn   discharge   of   its   solemn   Constitutional   obligation\n\nto enliven the Fundamental Rights of life and personal\n\nliberty   and   to   eliminate   inequality   with   a   view   to\nameliorate   the   lot   of   the   poor   and   the   Dalits,   the\n\nCentral   Government   has   launched   several   welfare\n\nschemes.   Some   of   such   schemes   are   PDS,   scholarship,\n\nmid day meals, LPG subsidies, free education,etc.\n\n72. The   requirement   to   undergo   authentication   on   the\n\nbasis   of   Aadhaar   number   is   made   mandatory   by\n\nSection   7\n.   This   requirement   is   only   for   “undertaking\n\nauthentication”.   However,   if   authentication   fails,\n\ndespite   more   than   one   attempt   then   the   possession   of\n\nAadhaar   number   can   be   proved   otherwise,   i.e.,   by\n\nproducing the Aadhaar card, and those who do not have\n\nAadhaar   number   can   make   an   application   for   enrolment\n\nand produce the enrolment id number (EID). This takes\n\ncare of non­exclusion.\n\n73. Aadhaar Act truly seeks to secure to the poor and\n\ndeprived persons an opportunity to live their life and\n\nexercise their liberty. By ensuring targeted delivery\n\nthrough   digital   identification,   it   not   only   provides\n\nthem   a   nationally   recognised   identity   but   also\n\nattempts   to   ensure   the   delivery   of   benefits,   service\nand   subsidies   with   the   aid   of   public\n\nexchequer/Consolidated   Fund   of   India.   And   it   does   so\n\nwithout impacting the Fundamental Right to Privacy of\n\nthe   Indians   or   at   best   minimally   impacting   it   with\n\nadequate safeguards.\n\n74. Regarding the numerization or numericalization of\n\nindividual argument, it is submitted that the Aadhaar\n\nnumber does not convert the human being into a number.\n\nThe   objective   of   the   Aadhaar   number   is   to   enable\n\nauthentication which is done on a 1:1 matching basis,\n\ni.e.,   to   say   when   the   requesting   entity   feeds   the\n\nAadhaar   number   along   with   some   identity   information\n\nthen   the   CIDR   picks   up   the   template   having   that\n\nAadhaar   number   automatically   and   matches   identity\n\ninformation   with   the   encrypted   information   in   the\n\ntemplate.   This   Aadhaar   number   is,   therefore,\n\nabsolutely essential for the technological success of\n\nauthentication.   It   is,   therefore,   a   technology\n\nrequirement and it does not amount to numerization or\n\nnumericalisation.   The   contention   of   the   petitioners\n\nignores   the   distinction   between   identity   and\nidentification.   The   12   digit   Aadhaar   number   is   not\n\ngiven   by   UIDAI   to   alter   the   identity   of   the\n\nindividual. It is provided to the enrolled individual\n\nto   enable   his   identification   through   authentication.\n\nAuthentication   is   a   multi   dimensional   identifying\n\nprocess.   The   Aadhaar   number   is   one   element   or   one\n\nidentifier   in   the   process   of   identification   through\n\nauthentication.   It   is   identificational   in   nature.\n\nSection 2(a) of Aadhaar Act defines Aadhaar number to\n\nmean “an identification number”.\nSection 2(c)\ndefines\n\nauthentication   as   a   process   requiring   submission   of\n\nAadhaar   number   to   CIDR   for   verification.   Further,\n\nSection 4(2)\nprovides that the Aadhaar number shall be\n\na   random   number   and  shall   bear   no   relation   to   the\n\nattributes   or identity   of   the   Aadhaar   number   holder.\n\nIt is proof of identity and not identity itself.\n\n75. Replying   the   submission   of   the   petitioners   that\n\nfundamental   right   of   privacy/dignity/autonomy   under\n\nArticle 21\ncould not  be waived. It  is submitted that\n\nSection 7 of Aadhaar Act does not involve any issue of\n\nwaiver.   When   an   individual   undergoes   any\nauthentication   to   establish   his   identity   to   receive\n\nbenefits, services or subsidies, he does so to enliven\n\nhis   fundamental   right   to   life   and   personal   liberty\n\nunder\nArticle 21.\n\n76. With   regard   to\nSection   57\n,   it   is   submitted   that\n\nsince   an infrastructure for establishing identity of\n\nresidents   is   available,   therefore,   Parliament   intends\n\nto make the use of Aadhaar number available for other\n\npurposes   provided   the   need   for   the   service   of\n\nauthentication arises pursuant to any law or contract.\n\nThe   rationale   seems   to   be   that   due   to   liberalisation\n\nand   privatisation   in   many   governmental   and   public\n\nsector   zones,   private   corporate   bodies   are   operating\n\nin   parallel   and   in   competition   with   public   sector   –\n\nbanking,   insurance,   defence,   health   etc.   These   are\n\nvital   core   sectors   absolutely   essential   for   National\n\nintegrity,   National   economy   and   life   of   people.   In\n\nmany   areas   private   bodies   operate   under   common\n\nregulators such as TRAI, Airport Authority, IRDA etc.\n\nThen there is rapidly growing e­commerce.\n77. In   Reply   to   the   submission   of   Shri   Kapil   Sibal\n\nthat the real object of the Act was to provide data to\n\nthe   digital   giants   like   Google,   Facebook   and   other\n\nprivate   players,   it   is   contended   that   there   is   no\n\nfactual   foundation   for   this   submission   in   any   writ\n\npetition.\nIn   the   Act\nthere   is   a   complete   bar   with\n\nrespect to sharing of core biometric information vide\n\nSection   29(1)\n.   The   non­core   biometric   information   is\n\nto be shared only as per the provisions of the Act and\n\nRegulations   and   with   prior   consent   and   only   for   the\n\npurpose of authentication.\n\n78. On the submission of the petitioners that power of\n\nUIDAI   to   add   identity   information   by   Regulation   is\n\nunguided and violative of\nArticle 14\n, it is submitted\n\nthat   clauses   (g)   and   (j)   of\nSection   2\nuse   the\n\nexpression   ‘such   other   biological   attribute’.   This\n\ngeneral   expression   needs   to   be   construed   by   applying\n\nthe   doctrine   of  ejusdem   generis.  The   use   of   word\n\n‘such’   implies   similarity   with   what   is   specifically\n\nmentioned   before   the   general   expression.   The\n\nRegulations   framed   by   UIDAI   are   required   to   be   laid\nbefore the Parliament under\nSection 55\n.\nSection 55\nis\n\na   mandatory   provision.   The   Parliament   has   power   to\n\nmodify   the   Regulation   and   also   to   reject   the\n\nRegulation.   This   is   a   legislative   check   on   the\n\nRegulation making power.\n\n79. Almost 3% of GDP amounting to trillions of rupees\n\nis   allocated   by   Governments   towards   subsidies,\n\nscholarships,   pensions,   education,   food   and   other\n\nwelfare programmes. But approximately half of it does\n\nnot   reach   the   intended   beneficiaries.   A   former   Prime\n\nMinister   said   only   15   out   of   100   rupees   reaches   the\n\ntarget   person.   This   was   confirmed   by   the   Planning\n\nCommission.   In   the   Audit   Report   No.3   of   2000   CAG\n\nstated   in   “Overview”   that   programmes   suffered   from\n\nserious targeting problems. It noted that bogus ration\n\ncards   were   being   used   for   diversions   (1.93   crores\n\nbogus).\n\n80. Even   otherwise,   there   is   no   other   identification\n\ndocument which is widely and commonly possessed by the\n\nresidents   of   the   country   and   most   of   the   identity\n\ndocuments   do   not   enjoy   the   quality   of   portability.\nThey   also   do   not   lend   assurance   and   accuracy   on\n\naccount   of   existence   of   fake,   bogus   and   ghost   cards.\n\nTherefore,   there   was   need   of   a   biometric   Aadhaar\n\nnumber   which   enables   de­duplication   and\n\nauthentication.\n\n81. Shri   Dwivedi   submits   that   security   and   data\n\nprivacy is ensured in the following manner:­\n\n(i) The   data   sent   to   ABIS   is   completely\nanonymised.   The   ABIS   systems   do   not\nhave access to resident’s demographic\ninformation   as   they   are   only   sent\nbiometric   information   of   a   resident\nwith   a   reference   number   and   asked   to\nde­duplicate.   The   de­duplication\nresult   with   the   reference   number   is\nmapped   back   to   the   correct   enrolment\nnumber   by   the   Authorities   own\nenrolment server.\n\n(ii) The  ABIS   providers   only   provide\ntheir software and services. The data\nis   stored   in   UIDAI   storage   and   it\nnever leaves the secure premises.\n\n(iii) The   ABIS   providers   do   not   store   the\nbiometric   images   (source).   They   only\nstore template for the purposes of de­\nduplication (with reference number).\n\n(iv) The encrypted enrolment packet sent by\nthe   enrolment   client   software   to   the\nCIDR   is   decrypted   by   the   enrolment\nserver   but   the   decrypted   packet   is\nnever stored.\n\n(v) The   original   biometric   images   of\nfingerprints,   iris   and   face   are\narchived   and   stored   offline.   Hence,\nthey   cannot   be   accessed   through   an\nonline network.\n\n(vi) The   biometric   system   provides   high\naccuracy   of   over   99.86%.   The   mixed\nbiometric   have   been   adopted   only   to\nenhance the accuracy and to reduce the\nerrors   which   may   arise   on   account   of\nsome   residents   either   not   having\nbiometrics   or   not   having   some\nparticular biometric.\n\n82. Biometrics   are   being   used   for   unique\n\nidentification in e­passports by 120 countries. Out of\n\nthese   many   countries   use   fingerprints   and/or   iris\n\nscans.   Additionally   19   European   Countries   have   smart\n\nNational Identity cards having chips containing\nbiometric   information.   A   number   of   African   and   Asian\n\ncountries   are   also   using   biometrics   for\n\nidentification. The ECHR and ECJ have not declared the\n\nuse   of   biometrics   or   the   collection   and   storage   of\n\ndata   for   the   said   purpose   to   be   violative   of   Human\n\nRights.   It   has   infact   been   upheld   in   the   context   of\n\npassports, by the ECJ.\n\n83.  On   the   submissions   that   de­duplication/\n\nauthentication   software   has   been   received   from   three\n\nforeign   suppliers   and   since   the   source   code   of   the\n\nalgorithm   is   with   the   foreign   suppliers,   therefore,\n\nthey can easily obtain the data in the CIDR merely by\n\nmanipulation   of   the   algorithm,   Shri   Dwivedi   submits\n\nthat foreign biometric solution providers only provide\n\nthe   software,   the   server   and   hardware   belongs   to\n\nUIDAI. So far the software is concerned UIDAI uses the\n\nsoftware as licensee. There is  no free  access to the\n\nserver   room   which   is   wholly   secured   by   security\n\nguards.   The   enrolment   data   packet,   after   being\n\nreceived in the data center, is decrypted for a short\n\nduration   to   enable   extraction   of   minutiae   and\npreparation   of   templates.   Once   the   template   is\n\nprepared   the   entire   biometric   data   is   stored   offline\n\nunder the complete control of the UIDAI officials.\n\n84. It   is   correct   that   the   source   code   for   the\n\nalgorithms   provided   are   retained   by   the   BSPs   which\n\nconstitutes   the   intellectual   property   right   of   the\n\nBSP, however, it does not introduce any insecurity of\n\ndata   in   the   CIDR   as   the   softwares   operate\n\nautomatically   in   the   servers   located   in   the   server\n\nrooms and also because the software functions only on\n\nthe   basis   of   the   templates   whilst   the   biometric   data\n\nis stored offline.\n\n85. During   the   submissions,   Shri   Dwivedi   also\n\nemphasised on prohibition of sharing of core biometric\n\ninformation. As per\nSection 29(1)\nread with\nRegulation\n\n17(1)\nof   the   Aadhaar   (Sharing   of   Information)\n\nRegulations, 2016. Referring to various Regulations of\n\nthe above Regulations. Shri Dwivedi submitted that the\n\narchitecture   of   Aadhaar   and   its   functioning   does   not\n\npermit   CIDR   to   note   about   parties   of   any   transaction\nor   location   of   the   individual   seeking   identification\n\nof   his   Aadhaar   number.   Requesting   Agency   is   strictly\n\nrestricted to sharing of only demographic information\n\nplus photograph and for authentication only, and this\n\nis also with express and separate prior consent of the\n\nANH.   Requesting   Entities   cannot   share   authentication\n\nlogs   with   any   person   other   than   the   ANH   or   for\n\ngrievance redressal and resolution of disputes or with\n\nthe Authority for audit and shall not be used for any\n\npurpose other than stated in\nRegulation 18(5)\n.\n\n86. Elaborating   on   security   Shri   Dwivedi   submitted\n\nthat\nSection   28(4)\nmandates   that   the   UIDAI   shall\n\nensure that the agencies appointed by it have in place\n\nthe   appropriate   technical   and   organizational   security\n\nmeasures   for   the   information   and   ensure   that   the\n\nagreements   or   arrangements   entered   into   with   such\n\nagencies   impose   obligations   equivalent   to   those\n\nimposed on the Authority and require such agencies to\n\nact only on instructions from the Authority.\n\n87. RE  shall  ensure that  the  identity  information  of\nthe ANH or any other information generated during the\n\nauthentication   is   kept   confidential,   secure   and\n\nprotected   against   access,   use   and   disclosure   not\n\npermitted   under   the   Act   and   regulations.[\nRegulation\n\n17(1)(e)\n]. The private key used for digitally signing\n\nthe   authentication   request   and   the   license   keys   are\n\nkept   secure   and   access   controlled[\nRegulation   17(1)(f)\n\nand\n22(3)\n]. All   relevant   laws   and   regulations   in\n\nrelation to data storage and data protection relating\n\nto   Aadhaar   based   identity   information   in   their\n\nsystems, that of their agents and with authentication\n\ndevices are compiled with [\nRegulation 17(1)(g)\n].\n\n88.\nRegulation 22(4)\nprovides that RE shall adhere to\n\nall   regulations,   information   security   policies,\n\nprocesses,   standards,   specifications   and   guidelines\n\nissued from time to time.\n\n89. By virtue of\nSection 56\nand\nof the Aadhaar Act,\n\n2016,   the   provisions   of\nIT   Act,   2000\nare   applicable\n\nexcept where it is inconsistent with Aadhaar Act. The\n\nregular   regime   under   the\nIT   Act\nwith   all   its\n\nprovisions   for   punishment   and   penalty   are   attracted\nsince   the   biometric   information   is   an   electronic\n\nrecord   and   the   data   is   sensitive   personal   data   or\n\ninformation   as   defined   in   the\nIT   Act,   2000\n.   On\n\nsubmission   of   the   petitioner   that   there   is   no\n\nmechanism   for   raising   any   grievance,   Shri   Dwivedi\n\nsubmits that UIDAI has set up grievance redressal cell\n\nas contemplated under\nSection 23(1)(s)\nof the Act. Any\n\nANH can make a complaint for redressal of grievance.\n\n90. The   petitioner's   submission   that   Aadhaar   Act\n\nenables the State to put the entire population of the\n\ncountry in an electronic  leash  and to track them all\n\nthe time and it has converted itself as the State into\n\na totalitarian State, it is submitted that none of the\n\nfour clauses of\nRegulation 26\nentitle the authority to\n\nstore data about the purpose for which authentication\n\nis   being   done.  Section   32(3)   of   the   Aadhaar   Act\n\nspecifically   prohibits   the   authority   from   collecting,\n\nstoring or maintaining, whether directly or indirectly\n\nany   information   about   the   purpose   of   authentication.\n\nThe   proviso   to\nRegulation   26\nis   also   to   the   same\n\neffect.   Here,   “the   purpose   of   authentication”   means\nthe   nature   of   activity   being   conducted   by   ANH   in\n\nrelation   to   which   the   authentication   is   required   and\n\nis being done.\n\n91. It   is   submitted   that   the   devices   which   are   used\n\nfor   the   purpose   of   authentication   are   not   geared   or\n\ndesigned   to   record   the   nature   of   the   activity   being\n\ndone by the ANH which necessitates authentication. The\n\ndevice  can only tell  the authority about the  time of\n\nauthentication,   the   identity   of   the   RE,   the   PID,   the\n\ntime   and   nature   of   response,   the   code   of   the   device\n\nand   the   authentication   server   side   configurations.\n\nHence, with the aid of authentication record it is not\n\npossible for the UIDAI to track the nature of activity\n\nbeing   engaged   into   by   the   ANH.   In   fact,   in\n\noverwhelming   majority   of   cases   the   authentication\n\nrecord would not enable the authority to know even the\n\nplace/location where the activity is performed by the\n\nANH. The reason is that there are about 350 number of\n\nREs. The  REs alone can  authenticate with the  help of\n\nCIDR   and   this   is   done   by   them   through   the   ASA.   In   a\n\nlarge   number   of   cases,   the   organizations   requiring\nauthentication would be doing so through some RE with\n\nwhom   they   have   some   agreements.   To   illustrate   nic.in\n\nis   an   RE   which   provides   authentication   service   to\n\nlarge   number   of   government   organizations   who   have\n\nagreements   with   it.   The   authentication   record   would\n\nonly contain information about the identity about the\n\nRE. It will give information only about the RE(nic.in)\n\nand   not   about   the   organization   which   is   requiring\n\nauthentication   through   the   RE.   In   most   cases   the\n\nauthentication is one time.\n\n92. It   is   submitted   that   biometrics   is   being\n\nincreasingly   resorted   to   for   identification   purposes\n\nby many countries. At least 19 countries in Europe are\n\nusing   biometric   smart   cards   where   data   is   stored   in\n\nthe chip. These smart cards are similar to the  smart\n\ncards which were used under the 2006 Act in U.K. The\n\nimportant difference lies in the extent of data of the\n\nindividual   which   is   stored   in   the   smart   card.   The\n\nEuropean   cards   unlike   the   UK,   do   not   store   50\n\ncategories   of   data   which   was   being   stored   in   the   UK\n\ncard   that   came   to   be   abolished   in   2010   by   the\nRepealing   Act,   2010\n.   In   some   European   countries   the\n\nsmart   cards   are   issued   in   a   decentralized   manner,   as\n\nin   Germany.   But   in   some   other   countries   the   smart\n\ncards   are   issued   in   a centralized   manner.   In   either\n\ncase,   the   State   is   possessed   of   all   the   information\n\nwhich is stored in the chip of the smart card, though\n\nit   may   not   involve   authentication.   These   smart   cards\n\nare   considered   to   be   property   of   the   State   and   the\n\nState can require the production of the smart card for\n\nidentification   at   any   time.   Estonia   is   considered   to\n\nbe   a   pioneer   and   leader   in   the   field   of   the   use   of\n\nbiometrics and it has a centralized data base.\n\n93. It   is   submitted   that   the   architecture   of   the\n\nAadhaar   Act   does   not   lead   to   any   real   possibility,\n\nproximate or remote of mass surveillance in real time\n\nby   the   State.   This   is   not   an   Act   for   empowering\n\nsurveillance   by   the   State.   It merely   empowers   the\n\nState   to   ensure   proper   delivery   of   welfare   measures\n\nmandated by Directive Principles of State Policy(Part\n\nIV   of   the   Constitution)   which   actually   enliven   the\n\nFundamental Rights under\nArticle 14\n, 19\nand\nof the\nConstitution for a vast majority of the poor and down\n\ntrodden   in   the   country   and   thereby   to   bring   about\n\ntheir comprehensive emancipation. It seeks to ensure,\n\njustice, social, economic and political for the little\n\nIndians.\n\n94. Responding   on   the   arguments   raised   by   the\n\npetitioner  on\nSection 47\nof the Act, it is  submitted\n\nthat\nSection   47\nhas   rationale.   The   offences   and\n\npenalties   under   Chapter   VII   are   all   intended   to\n\nmaintain   the   purity   and   integrity   of   CIDR   which   has\n\nbeen   established   of   the   ANH.   Secondly,   the   entire\n\nenrolment, storage in CIDR and authentication exercise\n\nis   so   vast   and   that   any   breach   can   be   handled   with\n\nefficiency   and   effectively   only   by   UIDAI.   There   are\n\nsimilar   enactments   which   contain   similar   provisions\n\nwhich   have   been   upheld   by   this   Court.   An   individual\n\ncan   make   a   complaint   to   UIDAI   directly   or   through\n\ngrievance   redressal   cell.   The   authority   would   be\n\nobliged   to   examine   the   complaints   and   to   lodge   the\n\ncomplaint   in   the   Court   as   per\nSection   47\n.\n\nAdditionally,   the   individual   is   generally   likely   to\nhave   a   complaint   of identity   theft,   cheating   or\n\ndisclosure.   In   such   a   situation   he   can   always   invoke\n\nthe provisions of\nSections 66C\n,\n66D\nand\n72A\nof the IT\n\nAct,   2000.   The   said   offences   carry   identical\n\npenalties.\n\n95. Elaborating   on\nSection   59\nof   the   Act,   it   is\n\nsubmitted   that\nSection   59\npurports   to   provide   a\n\nstatutory basis to the resolution of the Government of\n\nIndia,   Planning   Commission   dated   28.01.2009   and   also\n\nto  validate anything done or any  action taken by the\n\nCentral Government under the said resolution. Section\n\n59 of the Aadhaar Act seeks to continue what was done\n\nand the actions which were taken under the Resolution\n\ndated 28.01.2009.\nSection 59\nis clearly extending its\n\nprotection   retrospectively   to   that   which   was   done\n\nunder the notification dated 28.01.2009.\n\n96.\nSection 59\nprovides a deemed fiction. As a result\n\nof this deemed fiction one has to imagine that all the\n\nactions   taken   under   the   aforesaid   notifications   were\n\ndone   under   the   Act   and   not   under   the   aforesaid\n\nnotifications.\n97. Replying   the   submission   of   the   petitioner   that\n\nlarge   scale   of   marginal   section   of   the   society   is\n\ndeprived   due   to   exclusion   from   getting   the   benefits\n\nand   the   Act   violates\nArticle   14\nof   the   Constitution,\n\nit is submitted that there is no exclusion on account\n\nof de­duplication. It cannot be denied that there may\n\nbe   some   cases   where   due   to   non­identification,   a\n\nperson may have been put to some dis­advantage but on\n\nfailure   of   authentication   the   authorities   have   clear\n\ndiscretion to accept other means of identification to\n\ndeliver the subsidies and benefits. In any view of the\n\nmatter on some administrative lapses and some mistakes\n\nin   implementation   does   not   lead   to   conclude   that   Act\n\nis   unconstitutional   and   wrong   implementation   of   the\n\nAct   does   not   effect   the   constitutionality   of   the\n\nstatutes.\n\n98. Learned   counsel   for   the   parties   have   placed\n\nreliance   on   several   judgments   of   this   Court   and\n\nForeign   Courts   in   support   of   their   respective\nsubmissions   which   we   shall   notice   while   considering\n\nthe respective submissions hereinafter.\n\n99. Apart   from   hearing   elaborate   submissions   made   by\n\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the\n\nrespondents,   we   have   also   heard   several   learned\n\ncounsel for the intervener. The submission made by the\n\nintervener has already been covered by learned counsel\n\nfor   the   petitioners   as   well   as   for   the   respondents,\n\nhence it needs no repetition.\n\n100. We   have   considered   the   submissions   raised   before\n\nus.   From   the   pleadings   on   record   and   the   submissions\n\nmade   following  are   the   main   issues   which   arise   for\n\nconsideration:­\n\n(1) Whether   requirement   under   Aadhaar   Act   to   give\n\none's   demographic   and   biometric   information   is\n\nviolative of fundamental right of privacy ?\n\n(2) Whether the provisions of Aadhaar Act requiring\n\ndemographic   and   biometric   information   from   a\n\nresident for Aadhaar number are unconstitutional\n\nand do not pass three fold test as\nlaid down in\nPuttaswamy\ncase ?\n\n(3) Whether   collection   of   data   of   residents,   its\n\nstorage, retention and use violates fundamental\n\nright of privacy ?\n\n(4) Whether Aadhaar Act creates an architecture for\n\npervasive surveillance amounting to violation of\n\nfundamental right of privacy ?\n\n(5) Whether the Aadhaar Act provides protection and\n\nsafety of the data collected and received from\n\nindividual ?\n\n(6) Whether   Section   7   of   Aadhaar   Act   is\n\nunconstitutional   since   it   requires   that   for\n\npurposes   of   establishment   of   identity   of   an\n\nindividual for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice   such   individual   should   undergo\n\nauthentication or furnish proof of possession of\n\nAadhaar number or satisfy that such person has\n\nmade an application for enrolment ? Further the\n\nprovision deserves to be struck down on account\nof large number of denial of rightful claims of\n\nvarious marginalised section of society and down\n\ntrodden?\n\n(7) Can the State while   enlivening right to food,\n\nright to shelter etc. envisaged under\nArticle 21\n\nencroach   upon   the   rights   of   privacy   of   the\n\nbeneficiaries ?\n\n(8) Whether Section 29 of the Aadhaar Act is liable\n\nto be struck down inasmuch as it permits sharing\n\nof identity information ?\n\n(9) Whether\nSection 33\nis unconstitutional inasmuch\n\nas it provides for the use of Aadhaar data base\n\nfor   Police   investigation,   which   violates   the\n\nprotection   against   self­incrimination   as\n\nenshrined   under\nArticle   20(3)\nof   the\n\nConstitution of India ?\n\n(10) Whether   Section   47   of   Aadhaar   Act   is\n\nunconstitutional  inasmuch  as  it  does  not   allow\n\nan   individual   who   finds   that   there   is   a\nviolation of Aadhaar Act to initiate a criminal\n\nprocess ?\n\n(11) Whether Section 57 of Aadhaar Act which allows\n\nan unrestricted extension of Aadhaar information\n\nof an individual for any purpose whether by the\n\nState or any body, corporate or person pursuant\n\nto any law or contact is unconstitutional ?\n\n(12) Whether\nSection 59\nis capable of validating all\n\nactions   taken   by   the   Central   Government   under\n\nnotification   dated   28.01.2009   or   under\n\nnotification   dated   12.09.2015   and   all   such\n\nactions   can   be   deemed   to   be   taken   under   the\n\nAadhaar Act?\n\n(13) Whether Aadhaar Act is unconstitutional since it\n\ncollects   the   identity   information   of   children\n\nbetween 5 to 18 years without parental consent ?\n\n(14) Whether   Rule   9   as   amended   by   PMLA   (Second\n\nAmendment) Rules, 2017 is unconstitutional being\n\nviolative of\nArticle 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n, 21\nand\n300A\nof Constitution of India and Section 3,7, 51 of\n\nAadhaar   Act.   Further,   whether   Rule   9   is   ultra\n\nvires to the\nPMLA Act, 2002\n. itself.\n\n(15) Whether circular dated 23.02.2017 issued by the\n\nDepartment of Telecommunications, Government of\n\nIndia is ultra vires.\n\n(16) Whether Aadhaar Act could not have been passed\n\nas Money Bill ? Further, whether the decision of\n\nSpeaker   of   Lok   Sabha   certifying   the   Aadhaar\n\n(Targeted   Delivery   of   Financial   and   other\n\nSubsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 as\n\nMoney Bill is subject to judicial review ?\n\n(17)     Whether\nSection   139\n­AA   of   the   Income   Tax   Act,\n\n1961 is unconstitutional in view of the Privacy\n\njudgment in\nPuttaswamy\ncase?\n\n(18)   Whether Aadhaar Act violates the Interim Orders\n\npassed   by   this   Court   in   Writ   Petition   (C)   No.\n\n494 of 2012 & other connected cases?\nWhether   requirement   under   Aadhaar   Act   to\ngive   one's   demographic   and   biometric\ninformation   is   violative   of   fundamental\nIssue   Nos.1 right of privacy ? And\nand 2  Whether   the   provisions   of   Aadhaar   Act\nrequiring   demographic   and   biometric\ninformation   from   a   resident   for   Aadhaar\nnumber   are   unconstitutional   and   do   not\npass   three   fold   test   as\nlaid   down   in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase ?\n\n101.  Before we answer the above issues we need to look\n\ninto the object and purpose for which Aadhaar Act was\n\nenacted.   The   Statement   of   Objects   and   Reasons\n\nparticularly   paragraph   5   of   such   Statement   throws\n\nlight   on   the   object   for   which   Legislation   came   into\n\nexistence. Paragraph 5 of the Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons is as follows:\n\n“5.   The   Aadhaar   (Targeted   Delivery   of\nFinancial   and   Other   Subsidies,   Benefits   and\nServices)   Bill,   2016,   inter   alia,   seeks   to\nprovide for—\n\n(a)   issue   of   Aadhaar   numbers   to\nindividuals   on   providing   his\ndemographic   and   biometric\ninformation   to   the   Unique\nIdentification Authority of India;\n\n(b)   requiring   Aadhaar   numbers   for\nidentifying   an   individual   for\ndelivery of benefits, subsidies, and\nservices the expenditure is incurred\nfrom or the receipt therefrom forms\npart   of   the   Consolidated   Fund   of\nIndia;\n\n(c)   authentication   of   the   Aadhaar\nnumber   of   an   Aadhaar   number   holder\nin   relation   to   his   demographic   and\nbiometric information;\n\n(d)   establishment   of   the   Unique\nIdentification   Authority   of   India\nconsisting   of   a   Chairperson,   two\nMembers   and   a   Member­Secretary   to\nperform   functions   in   pursuance   of\nthe objectives above;\n\n(e)   maintenance   and   updating   the\ninformation   of   individuals   in   the\nCentral   Identities   Data   Repository\nin   such   manner   as   may   be

in   the   Central\nIdentities Data Repository; and\n\n(g)   offences   and   penalties   for\ncontravention   of   relevant   statutory\nprovisions.”\n\n102.   Preamble to any Act is a key to read and unfold\n\nan enactment. The Preamble of Aadhaar Act reads:\n\n“\nAn Act\nto provide for, as a good governance,\nefficient, transparent, and targeted delivery\nof   subsidies,   benefits   and   services,   the\nexpenditure   for   which   is   incurred   from   the\nConsolidated   Fund   of   India,   to   individuals\nresiding in India through assigning of unique\nidentity numbers to such individuals and for\nmatters   connected   therewith   or   incidental\nthereto.”\n\n103.\nSection   2\nof   the   Act   is   definition   clause.\n\nSection 2(a)\ndefines “Aadhaar number” in the following\n\nmanner:\n\n“2(a)   “Aadhaar   number”   means   an\nidentification number issued to an individual\nunder sub­section (3) of\nsection 3\n;”\n\n104.\nSections   2(g)\nand\n2(k)\ndefine   “biometric\n\ninformation” and “demographic information” which is to\n\nthe following effect:\n\n“2(g)   “biometric   information”   means\nphotograph, finger print, Iris scan, or such\nother   biological   attributes  of   an   individual\nas may be specified by regulations;\n\n(k)   “demographic   information”   includes\ninformation   relating   to   the   name,   date   of\nbirth, address and other relevant information\nof   an   individual,   as   may   be   specified   by\nregulations   for   the   purpose   of   issuing   an\nAadhaar   number,   but   shall   not   include   race,\nreligion,   caste,   tribe,   ethnicity,   language,\nrecords   of   entitlement,   income or   medical\nhistory;\n\n105.\nSection   3\nof   the   Act   deals   with   Aadhaar\n\nenrolment.\nSection 3\nis as follows:\n“3.(1)   Every   resident   shall   be   entitled   to\nobtain   an   Aadhaar   number   by   submitting   his\ndemographic   information   and   biometric\ninformation   by   undergoing   the   process   of\nenrolment:   Provided   that   the   Central\nGovernment   may,   from   time   to   time,

can\nbe made.\n\n(3) On receipt of the demographic information\nand   biometric   information   under   sub­section\n(1), the Authority shall, after verifying the\ninformation,   in   such   manner   as   may   be\nspecified   by   regulations,   issue   an   Aadhaar\nnumber to such individual.”\n\n106.  The challenge in this batch of cases is challenge\n\nto   the   Act   and   its   various   provisions   on   the   ground\n\nthat   the   Act   and   its   provisions   violate   right   of\n\nprivacy which is now recognised as fundamental right.\nAll aspects of  privacy right, which is  accepted as  a\n\nfundamental   right   under\nArticle   21\n,   have   been\n\nelaborately   and   authoritatively   dealt   by   nine­Judge\n\nConstitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in\nPuttaswamy\ncase\n\n(supra).\n\n107.  Alan F. Westin in his work “Privacy and Freedom”\n\ndefined   privacy   as   “the   desire   of   people   to   choose\n\nfreely   under   what   circumstances   and   to   what   extent\n\nthey will expose themselves, their attitudes and their\n\nbehaviour to others”.\n\n108.    Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J., in his opinion (which\n\nexpresses   majority   opinion)   in   paragraph   3   of   the\n\njudgment while analysing the concept of privacy held:\n\n“3.  Privacy,   in   its   simplest   sense,   allows\neach human being to be left alone in a core\nwhich is inviolable. Yet the autonomy of the\nindividual   is   conditioned   by   her\nrelationships with the rest of society. Those\nrelationships may and do often pose questions\nto autonomy and free choice. The overarching\npresence   of   State   and   non­State   entities\nregulates   aspects   of   social   existence   which\nbear upon the freedom of the individual. The\npreservation of constitutional liberty is, so\nto   speak,   work   in   progress.   Challenges   have\nto   be   addressed   to   existing   problems.\n\nEqually, new challenges have to be dealt with\nin terms of a constitutional understanding of\nwhere   liberty   places   an   individual   in   the\ncontext   of   a   social   order.   The   emergence   of\nnew   challenges   is   exemplified   by   this   case,\nwhere the debate on privacy is being analysed\nin the context of a global information based\nsociety.   In   an   age   where   information\ntechnology   governs   virtually   every   aspect   of\nour   lives,   the   task   before   the   Court   is   to\nimpart   constitutional   meaning   to   individual\nliberty in an interconnected world. While we\nrevisit the question whether our Constitution\nprotects   privacy   as   an   elemental   principle,\nthe Court has to be sensitive to the needs of\nand   the   opportunities   and   dangers   posed   to\nliberty in a digital world.”\n\n109.   Dwelling   on   essential   nature   of   privacy   in\n\nparagraphs 297 and 298 following has been\nlaid down by\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.:\n\n“297.  What,   then,   does   privacy   postulate?\nPrivacy   postulates   the   reservation   of   a\nprivate space for the individual, described as\nthe   right   to   be   let   alone.   The   concept   is\nfounded on the autonomy of the individual. The\nability of an individual to make choices lies\nat   the   core   of   the   human   personality.   The\nnotion   of   privacy   enables   the   individual   to\nassert and control the human element which is\ninseparable   from   the   personality   of   the\nindividual. The inviolable nature of the human\npersonality   is   manifested   in   the   ability   to\nmake   decisions   on   matters   intimate   to   human\nlife.   The   autonomy   of   the   individual   is\nassociated   over   matters   which   can   be   kept\nprivate.   These   are   concerns   over   which   there\nis   a   legitimate   expectation   of   privacy.   The\nbody and the mind are inseparable elements of\nthe   human   personality.   The   integrity   of   the\nbody and the sanctity of the mind can exist on\nthe foundation that each individual possesses\nan inalienable ability and right to preserve a\nprivate   space   in   which   the   human   personality\ncan   develop.   Without   the   ability   to   make\nchoices, the inviolability of the personality\nwould   be in   doubt.   Recognising   a   zone   of\nprivacy   is   but   an   acknowledgment   that   each\nindividual   must   be   entitled   to   chart   and\npursue   the   course   of   development   of\npersonality.   Hence   privacy   is   a   postulate   of\nhuman dignity itself....\n\n298.  Privacy   of   the   individual   is   an\nessential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both\nan   intrinsic   and   instrumental   value.   As   an\nintrinsic   value,   human   dignity   is   an\nentitlement   or   a   constitutionally   protected\ninterest   in   itself.   In   its   instrumental\nfacet,   dignity   and   freedom   are   inseparably\nintertwined,   each   being   a   facilitative   tool\nto   achieve   the   other.   The   ability   of   the\nindividual   to   protect   a   zone   of   privacy\nenables the realisation of the full value of\nlife   and   liberty.   Liberty   has   a   broader\nmeaning   of   which   privacy   is   a   subset.   All\nliberties   may   not   be   exercised   in   privacy.\n\nYet   others   can   be   fulfilled   only   within   a\nprivate space. Privacy enables the individual\nto retain the autonomy of the body and mind.\n\nThe autonomy of the individual is the ability\nto make decisions on vital matters of concern\nto   life.   Privacy  has   not  been  couched  as   an\nindependent  fundamental  right.   But   that  does\nnot   detract   from   the   constitutional\nprotection   afforded   to   it,   once   the   true\nnature   of   privacy   and   its   relationship   with\nthose   fundamental   rights   which   are   expressly\nprotected   is   understood.   Privacy   lies   across\nthe   spectrum   of   protected   freedoms.   The\nguarantee of equality is a guarantee against\narbitrary State action. It prevents the State\nfrom   discriminating   between   individuals.   The\ndestruction   by   the   State   of   a   sanctified\npersonal space whether of the body or of the\nmind   is   violative   of   the   guarantee   against\narbitrary   State   action.   Privacy   of   the   body\nentitles   an   individual   to   the   integrity   of\nthe   physical   aspects   of   personhood.   The\nintersection   between   one’s   mental   integrity\nand   privacy   entitles   the   individual   to\nfreedom of thought, the freedom to believe in\nwhat   is   right,   and   the   freedom   of   self­\ndetermination.   When   these   guarantees\nintersect with gender, they create a private\nspace which protects all those elements which\nare   crucial   to   gender   identity.   The   family,\nmarriage,   procreation   and   sexual   orientation\nare   all   integral   to   the   dignity   of   the\nindividual.   Above   all,   the   privacy   of   the\nindividual   recognises   an   inviolable  right   to\ndetermine how freedom shall be exercised.”\n\n110.   This Court has further held that like the right\n\nto   life   and   liberty,   privacy   is   not   absolute.     Any\n\ncurtailment or deprivation of that right would have to\n\ntake   place   under   a   regime   of   law.   In   paragraph   313\n\nfollowing has been held:\n\n“313.  Privacy   has   been   held   to   be   an\nintrinsic   element   of   the   right   to   life   and\npersonal   liberty   under\nArticle   21\nand   as   a\nconstitutional value which is embodied in the\nfundamental freedoms embedded in Part III of\nthe Constitution. Like the right to life and\nliberty,   privacy   is   not   absolute.   The\nlimitations   which   operate   on   the   right   to\nlife   and   personal   liberty   would   operate   on\nthe   right to   privacy.   Any   curtailment   or\ndeprivation of that right would have to take\nplace   under   a   regime   of   law.   The   procedure\nestablished   by   law   must   be   fair,   just   and\nreasonable.   The   law   which   provides   for   the\ncurtailment of the right must also be subject\nto constitutional safeguards.”\n\n111.   Further   elaboration   of   the   core   of   privacy   has\n\nbeen stated in the following words in paragraphs 322,\n\n323 and 326:\n\n“322.  Privacy   is   the   constitutional   core   of\nhuman   dignity.   Privacy   has   both   a   normative\nand   descriptive   function.   At   a   normative\nlevel   privacy   subserves  those   eternal   values\nupon   which   the   guarantees   of   life,   liberty\nand   freedom   are   founded.   At   a   descriptive\nlevel,   privacy   postulates   a   bundle   of\nentitlements   and   interests   which   lie   at   the\nfoundation of ordered liberty.\n\n323.  Privacy   includes   at   its   core   the\npreservation   of   personal   intimacies,   the\nsanctity   of   family   life,   marriage,\nprocreation, the home and sexual orientation.\n\nPrivacy   also   connotes   a   right   to   be   left\nalone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy\nand recognises the ability of the individual\nto control vital aspects of his or her life.\n\nPersonal choices governing a way of life are\nintrinsic   to   privacy.   Privacy   protects\nheterogeneity   and   recognises   the   plurality\nand   diversity   of   our   culture.   While   the\nlegitimate   expectation   of   privacy   may   vary\nfrom   the   intimate   zone   to   the   private   zone\nand from the private to the public arenas, it\nis   important   to   underscore   that   privacy   is\nnot   lost   or   surrendered   merely   because   the\nindividual   is   in   a   public   place.   Privacy\nattaches   to   the   person   since   it   is   an\nessential   facet   of   the   dignity   of   the   human\nbeing.\n\n326.  Privacy   has   both   positive   and   negative\ncontent.   The   negative   content   restrains   the\nState   from   committing   an   intrusion   upon   the\nlife   and   personal   liberty   of   a   citizen.   Its\npositive content imposes an obligation on the\nState   to   take   all   necessary   measures   to\nprotect the privacy of the individual.”\n\n112.   The first issue which is under consideration is\n\nas   to   whether   requirement   under   the   Aadhaar   Act   to\n\ngive   one’s   biometric   and   demographic   information   is\n\nviolative of fundamental right of privacy. Demographic\n\nand   biometric   information   has   been   defined   in\n\nSection   2\nas   noted   above.   Biometric   information   and\n\ndemographic   information   are   two   distinct   concepts   as\n\ndelineated   in   the   Act   itself.   We   first   take   up   the\n\ndemographic   information   which   includes   information\n\nrelating to the name, date of birth, address and other\n\nrelevant   information   of   an   individual,   as   may   be\n\nspecified by regulations for the purpose of issuing an\n\nAadhaar   number.   There   is   also   injunction   in\nSection\n\n2(k)\nthat   demographic   information   shall   not   include\n\nrace,   religion,   caste,   tribe,   ethnicity,   language,\nrecords   of   entitlement,   income   or   medical   history.\n\nThus, demographic information which are   contemplated\n\nto  be given in the  Act are  very limited information.\n\nThe   Regulations   have   been   framed   under   Act,   namely,\n\nAadhaar   (Enrolment   and   Update)   Regulations,   2016.\n\nRegulation   4\nenumerates   demographic   information   which\n\nshall   be   collected   from   individuals   undergoing\n\nenrolment.\nRegulation 4\nis as follows:\n\n“4.   Demographic   information   required   for\nenrolment.  —   (1)   The   following   demographic\ninformation   shall   be   collected   from   all\nindividuals   undergoing   enrolment   (other   than\nchildren below five years of age):\n\n(i)    Name;\n(ii)  Date of Birth;\n(iii)  Gender;\n(iv)   Residential Address.\n\n(2) The following demographic information may\nalso   additionally   be   collected   during\nenrolment,   at   the   option   of   the   individual\nundergoing enrolment:\n\n(i)   Mobile number;\n(ii)  Email address.\n\n(3)   In   case   of   Introducer­based   enrolment,\nthe following additional information shall be\ncollected:\n\n(i)   Introducer name;\n\n(ii)  Introducer’s Aadhaar number.\n(4)   In   case   of   Head   of   Family   based\nenrolment,   the   following   additional\ninformation shall be collected:\n\n(i)  Name of Head of Family;\n\n(ii)  Relationship;\n\n(iii)  Head   of   Family’s   Aadhaar\nnumber;\n\n(iv)   One   modality   of   biometric\ninformation  of   the\nHead of Family.\n\n(5)   The   standards   of   the   above   demographic\ninformation   shall   be   as   may   be   specified   by\nthe Authority for this purpose.\n\n(6)   The   demographic   information   shall   not\ninclude   race,   religion,   caste,   tribe,\nethnicity,   language,   record   of   entitlement,\nincome or medical history of the resident.”\n\n113.   A   perusal   of\nRegulation   4\nindicates   that\n\ninformation   which   shall   be   collected   from   individual\n\nare   his   name,   date   of birth,   gender   and   residential\n\naddress.   The   additional   information   which   can   be\n\ncollected   at   the   option   of   the   individual   is   mobile\n\nnumber   and   e­mail   address.   Schedule   I   of   the\n\nRegulation   contains   format   of   enrolment   form   which\n\ncontains columns for information as contemplated under\n\nRegulation 4\n.\n114.   The   information   contemplated   under\nRegulation   4\n\nare   nothing   but   information   relating   to   identity   of\n\nthe person.\n\n115.  Every person born on earth takes birth at a place\n\nat a time with a parentage. In the society person is\n\nidentified as a person born as son or daughter of such\n\nand   such.   The   identity   of   person   from   the   time   of\n\ntaking   birth   is   an   identity   well   known   and   generally\n\nevery person describes himself or herself to be son or\n\ndaughter of such and such person.\n\n116.  Every person, may be a child in school, a person\n\nat his workplace, relates himself or herself with his\n\nor   her   parent’s,   place   of   birth   etc.,   in   interaction\n\nwith   his   near   and   dear   and   outside   world   a   person\n\nwillingly   and   voluntarily   reveals   his   identity   to\n\nothers   in   his   journey   of   life.     The   demographic\n\ninformation   are   readily   provided   by   individuals\n\nglobally   for   disclosing   identity   while   relating   with\n\nothers;   while   seeking   benefits   whether   provided   by\n\ngovernment   or   by   private   entities.   People   who   get\nregistered   for   engaging   in   a   profession,   who   take\n\nadmissions   in   schools/colleges/   university,   who   seek\n\nemployment in the government or private concerns, and\n\nthose who engage in various trade and commerce are all\n\nrequired to provide demographic information. Hence, it\n\ncan be safely said that there cannot be a reasonable\n\nexpectation   of   privacy   with   regard   to   such\n\ninformation. There are large number of statutes which\n\nprovide   for   giving   demographic   information   by   the\n\nindividuals. For inclusion of name of a person in the\n\nElectoral   List   as   per   the   Registration   of   Electoral\n\nRules, 1960 framed under the\nRepresentation of People\n\nAct,   1950\n,   a   person   is   required   to   give   similar\n\ndemographic   information   in   Form   II,   i.e.,   name,   date\n\nof   birth,   gender,   current   address   and   permanent\n\naddress,   which   also   contains   optional   particulars   of\n\nemail   address   and   mobile   number.   Under   Central   Motor\n\nVehicle   Rules,   1989   person   making   an   application   for\n\ndriving   licence   is   required   to   give   name,   parent,\n\npermanent   address,   temporary   address,   date   of   birth,\n\nplace of birth, educational qualification, etc.\n117.\nUnder   Special   Marriage   Act\n,   name,   condition,\n\noccupation,   age,   dwelling   place,   age,   etc.   are   to   be\n\ngiven. Thus, providing such demographic information in\n\nmost   of   the   statutes   clearly   indicates   that   those\n\ninformation   are   readily   provided   and   no   reasonable\n\nexpectation   of   privacy   has   ever   been   claimed   or\n\nperceived in above respect.\n\n118.   It is well settled that breach of privacy right\n\ncan be claimed only when claimant on the facts of the\n\nparticular   case   and   circumstances   have   “reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy”. In Court of Appeal in  Regina\n\n(Wood)   v.   Commissioner   of   Police   of   the   Metropolis,\n\n(2009)  EWCA Civ 414:  (2010) 1 WLR 123,  following was\n\nheld:\n\n“22.   This   cluster   of   values,   summarised   as\nthe personal autonomy of every individual and\ntaking concrete form as a presumption against\ninterference   with   the   individual's   liberty,\nis   a   defining   characteristic   of   a   free\nsociety.   We   therefore   need   to   preserve   it\neven in little cases. At the same time it is\nimportant   that   this   core   right   protected   by\n\nArticle   8\n,   however   protean,   should   not   be\nread so widely that its claims become unreal\nand   unreasonable.   For   this   purpose   I   think\nthere   are   three   safeguards,   or\nqualifications.  First,   the   alleged   threat   or\nassault to the individual's personal autonomy\nmust  (if\nArticle  8\nis  to   be  engaged)   attain\n\"a   certain   level   of   seriousness\".   Secondly,\nthe  touchstone   for\nArticle   8(1)\n's   engagement\nis whether the claimant enjoys on the facts a\n\"reasonable   expectation   of   privacy\"   (in   any\nof   the   senses   of   privacy   accepted   in   the\ncases). Absent such an expectation, there is\nno   relevant   interference   with   personal\nautonomy.   Thirdly,   the   breadth of\nArticle\n8(1)\nmay   in   many   instances   be   greatly\ncurtailed by the scope of the justifications\navailable   to   the   State   pursuant   to\nArticle\n8(2).\nI   shall   say   a   little   in   turn   about\nthese three antidotes to the overblown use of\n\nArticle 8.\n\n24.   As   for   the   second   ­   a   \"reasonable\nexpectation   of   privacy\"   ­   I   have   already\ncited paragraph 51 of Von Hannover, with its\nreference to that very phrase, and also to a\n\"legitimate   expectation\"   of   protection.   One\nmay   compare   a   passage   in   Lord   Nicholls'\nopinion in Campbell at paragraph 21:\n\n\"Accordingly,   in   deciding   what   was\nthe   ambit   of   an   individual's\n'private   life'   in   particular\ncircumstances   courts   need   to   be   on\nguard against using as a touchstone\na   test   which   brings   into   account\nconsiderations   which   should   more\nproperly be considered at the later\nstage   of   proportionality.\n\nEssentially   the   touchstone   of\nprivate   life   is   whether   in   respect\nof the disclosed facts the person in\nquestion   had   a   reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\"\nIn the same case Lord Hope said at paragraph\n99:\n\n\"The   question   is   what   a   reasonable\nperson   of   ordinary   sensibilities\nwould feel if she was placed in the\nsame   position   as   the   claimant   and\nfaced with the same publicity.\"\n\nIn Murray v Big Pictures (UK) Ltd Sir Anthony\nClarke     MR   referred   to   both   of   these\npassages, and stated:\n\n\"35...   [S]o   far   as   the   relevant\nprinciples   to   be   derived   from\nCampbell   are   concerned,   they   can   we\nthink be summarised in this way. The\nfirst question is whether there is a\nreasonable   expectation   of   privacy.\n\nThis   is   of   course   an   objective\nquestion. ...\n\n36.   As   we   see   it,   the   question\nwhether   there   is   a   reasonable\nexpectation   of   privacy   is   a   broad\none,   which   takes   account   of all   the\ncircumstances   of   the   case.   They\ninclude   the   attributes   of   the\nclaimant, the nature of the activity\nin   which   the   claimant   was   engaged,\nthe place at which it was happening,\nthe   nature   and   purpose   of   the\nintrusion, the absence of consent and\nwhether   it   was   known   or   could   be\ninferred, the effect on the claimant\nand   the   circumstances   in   which   and\nthe   purposes   for   which   the\ninformation   came   into   the   hands   of\nthe publisher.\"\n119.   The   reasonable   expectation   of   privacy   test   was\n\nalso noticed and approved in privacy judgment, Dr. D.Y\n\nChandrachud,   J.   has   referred   judgment   of   US   Supreme\n\nCourt   in  Katz   v.   United   States,   389   US   347   (1967),\n\nfollowing   has   been   observed   by   this   Court   in\nK.S.\n\nPuttaswamy\n(supra) in paragraph 185:\n\n“The   majority   adopted   the   “reasonable\nexpectation of privacy” test as formulated by\nHarlan, J. in Katz and held as follows:\n\n“7.   [The]   inquiry,   as   Mr   Justice\nHarlan   aptly   noted   in   his  Katz66\nconcurrence,   normally   embraces   two\ndiscrete   questions.   The   first   is\nwhether   the   individual,   by   his\nconduct,   has   “exhibited   an   actual\n(subjective)   expectation   of   privacy”\n… whether … the individual has shown\nthat   “he   seeks   to   preserve\n[something] as private”. … The second\nquestion is whether the individual’s\nsubjective expectation of privacy is\n“one   that   society   is   prepared   to\nrecognize as “reasonable” ” … whether\n…   the   individual’s   expectation,\nviewed   objectively,   is   “justifiable”\nunder the circumstances. …\n\n8.   …   Since   the   pen   register   was\ninstalled   on   telephone   company\nproperty   at   the   telephone   company’s\ncentral   offices,   petitioner\nobviously   cannot   claim   that   his\n“property”   was   invaded   or   that\npolice   intruded   into   a\n“constitutionally protected area”.”\n\nThus   the   Court   held   that   the   petitioner   in\nall   probability   entertained   no   actual\nexpectation   of   privacy   in   the   phone   numbers\nhe   dialed,   and   that,   even   if   he   did,   his\nexpectation   was   not   “legitimate”.   However,\nthe   judgment   also   noted   the   limitations   of\nthe Katz test:\n\n“Situations   can   be   imagined,   of\ncourse,   in   which   Katz66  two­pronged\ninquiry   would   provide   an   inadequate\nindex of Fourth Amendment protection.\n\n…   In   such   circumstances,   where   an\nindividual’s   subjective   expectations\nhad been “conditioned” by influences\nalien   to   well­recognised   Fourth\nAmendment   freedoms,   those   subjective\nexpectations obviously could play no\nmeaningful role in ascertaining what\nthe   scope   of   Fourth   Amendment\nprotection was.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n120.   After   noticing   several   judgments   of   US   Supreme\n\nCourt,   D.Y.Chandrachud,   J.   in\nK.S.   Puttaswamy\n\n(supra)has   noted   that   the   reasonable   expectation   of\n\nprivacy   test   has   been   relied   on   by   various   other\n\njurisdictions   while   developing   the   right   of   privacy.\n\nIn paragraph 195 following has been held:\n\n“195. The development of the jurisprudence on\nthe right to privacy in the United States of\nAmerica   shows   that   even   though   there   is   no\nexplicit mention of the word “privacy” in the\nConstitution, the courts of the country have\nnot   only   recognised   the   right   to   privacy\nunder   various   amendments   to  the  Constitution\nbut also progressively extended the ambit of\nprotection under the right to privacy. In its\nearly   years,   the   focus   was   on   property   and\nprotection   of   physical   spaces   that   would   be\nconsidered   private   such   as   an   individual’s\nhome.   This   “trespass   doctrine”   became\nirrelevant   when   it   was   held   that   what   is\nprotected   under   the   right   to   privacy   is\n“people,   not   places”.   The   “reasonable\nexpectation of privacy” test has been relied\non   subsequently   by   various   other\njurisdictions   while   developing   the   right   to\nprivacy.”\n\n121.   As noted above an individual in interaction with\n\nsociety or while interacting with his close relatives\n\nnaturally   gives   and   reveals   his   several   information\n\ne.g.   his   name,   age,   date   of   birth,   residential\n\naddress, etc. We are of the opinion that in giving of\n\nthose   information   there   is   no   reasonable   expectation\n\nof   privacy.   Thus,   we   conclude   that   demographic\n\ninformation   required   to   be   given   in   the   process   of\n\nenrolment does not violate any right of privacy.\n\n122.    Every person born gets a name after his birth.\n\nHe strives throughout his life to establish himself to\nbe   recognised   by   society.   Recognition   by   fellow   man\n\nand society at  large  is cherished dream of all  human\n\nbeing,   for   fulfilling   the   above   dream,   he   does   not\n\nhide   himself   from   society   rather   takes   pride   in\n\nreasserting   himself   time   and   again   when   occasion\n\narises. He proclaims his identity time and again.\n\n123.   The right to identity is an essential component\n\nof   an   individual   in   her   relationship   with   the   State.\n\nThe   identification   is   only   the   proof   of   identity   and\n\neveryone   has   right   to   prove   his   identity   by   an\n\nacceptable   means.   Aadhaar   is   contemplated   as   one   PAN\n\nINDIA identity, which is acceptable proof of identity\n\nin every nook and corner of the country.\n\n124.   Reference   of   International   Declaration   and\n\ncovenants have been made to assert that providing for\n\nan   identity   to   every   resident   is   an   international\n\nobligation   of India.   In   this   reference   following   has\n\nbeen referred to:­\n\nName of the Provision\nConvention\n[Date of\nAccession]\nUniversal\nArticle   6:\nEveryone   has   the   right   to\nDeclaration of recognition   everywhere   as   a

different   from   his   or\nher own;....\n\n125. We may also notice one of the applications filed\n\nby an organisation, namely, Swatantra, which works for\n\nand   represents   the   interests   of   the   transgender   and\n\nsexual minorities communities in India. The submission\n\nhas   been   made   on   behalf   of   organisation   that   Aadhaar\nAct and Rules making the Unique Identification Number\n\n(UID)   or   the   Aadhaar   number   mandatory   and   requiring\n\nthem   to   provide   their   personal   demographic   and\n\nbiometric   information   for   enrolment   is   a   serious\n\ninfringement   of   the   constitutional   right   to   privacy\n\nand   dignity   of   transgender   persons.   It   is   submitted\n\nthat   the   transgender   community   has   experienced   a\n\nhistory   of   legally   and   socially   sanctioned   violence\n\nand discrimination from private individuals and State\n\nauthorities.\nReference   of   Criminal   Tribes   Act,   1871\n\nand   certain   State   legislations   has   been   made   in   this\n\nregard. The applicant also refers to judgment of this\n\nCourt   in  National   Legal   Services   Authority   and   Union\n\nof   India   and   others,   2014   (5)   SCC   438,  where   this\n\nCourt has held that the freedom of expression includes\n\none's right to expression of a self­identified gender\n\nidentity   through   dress,   action   behaviour   etc.   The\n\nsubmission has been made that making the disclosure of\n\ngender   under   Section   2   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   and\n\nRegulation   4\nof   the   Aadhaar   (Enrolment   &   Update)\n\nRegulations violates\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n126.   Further,   the   Aadhaar   Act   amounts   to\n\ndiscrimination   against   transgender   persons   under\n\nArticle   15\nof   the   Constitution   on   the   ground   of\n\ngender.   Further,   it   is   contended   that   disclosure   of\n\ngender identity violates\nArticle 21\nand\nArticle 19(1)\n\n(a) of the transgender persons.\n\n127. We   having   considered   the   provisions   of   the   Act\n\nand Enrolment and Update Regulations and having found\n\nthat   disclosure   of   demographic   information   does   not\n\nviolate   any   right   of   privacy, the   said   conclusion\n\nshall   also   be   fully   applicable with   regard   to\n\ntransgender. This Court in NALSA (supra) has held that\n\nArticle   19(1)(a)\nwhich   provides   that   all   citizens\n\nshall   have   the   right   to   freedom   of   speech   and\n\nexpression   which   includes   one's   right   to   expression\n\nand his self­identified gender, it  is the right of  a\n\nperson to identify his gender. In paragraphs 69 and 72\n\nof the judgment following has been laid down:\n\n“69.\nArticle   19(1)\nof   the   Constitution\nguarantees   certain   fundamental   rights,\nsubject  to  the   power   of  the  State  to   impose\nrestrictions   from   exercise   of   those   rights.\nThe   rights   conferred   by\nArticle   19\nare   not\navailable to any person who is not a citizen\nof   India.\nArticle   19(1)\nguarantees   those\ngreat   basic   rights   which   are   recognized   and\nguaranteed as the natural rights inherent in\nthe status of the citizen of a free country.\n\nArticle   19(1)(a)\nof   the   Constitution   states\nthat   all   citizens   shall   have   the   right   to\nfreedom   of   speech   and   expression,   which\nincludes   one's   right   to   expression   of   his\nself­identified   gender.   Self­identified\ngender can be expressed through dress, words,\naction   or   behavior   or   any   other   form.   No\nrestriction   can   be   placed   on   one's   personal\nappearance or choice of dressing, subject to\nthe   restrictions   contained   in\nArticle   19(2)\n\nof the Constitution.\n\n72.   Gender   identity,   therefore,   lies   at   the\ncore   of   one's   personal   identity,   gender\nexpression and presentation and, therefore, it\nwill have to be protected Under\nArticle 19(1)\n\n(a)   of   the   Constitution   of   India.   A\ntransgender's   personality   could   be   expressed\nby   the   transgender's   behavior   and\npresentation. State cannot prohibit, restrict\nor   interfere   with   a   transgender's   expression\nof   such   personality,   which   reflects   that\ninherent personality. Often the State and its\nauthorities   either   due   to   ignorance   or\notherwise fail to digest the innate character\nand   identity   of   such   persons.   We,   therefore,\nhold   that   values   of   privacy,   self­identity,\nautonomy   and   personal   integrity   are\nfundamental   rights   guaranteed   to   members   of\nthe transgender community Under\nArticle 19(1)\n\n(a) of the Constitution of India and the State\nis   bound   to   protect   and   recognize   those\nrights. ”\n\n128.   When   this   Court   has   already   recognised   the\nconstitutional   right   of   transgenders   of   their   self­\n\nidentification and it has been further held that self­\n\nidentification relates to their dignity. Dignity is a\n\nhuman right which every human being possesses.\nArticle\ncame   for   consideration   in   the   said   judgment   where\n\nthis   Court   held   that\nArticle   15\nhas   used   the\n\nexpression   'citizen'   and   'sex'   which   expressions   are\n\n'gender neutral'. The protection of fundamental rights\n\nis   equally   applicable   to   transgenders.     Paragraph   82\n\nis as follows:\n\n“82.\nArticle   14\nhas   used   the   expression\n\"person\"   and   the\nArticle   15\nhas   used   the\nexpression   \"citizen\"   and   \"sex\"   so   also\n\nArticle   16.\n\nArticle   19\nhas   also   used   the\nexpression \"citizen\".\nArticle 21\nhas used the\nexpression   \"person\".   All   these   expressions,\nwhich are \"gender neutral\" evidently refer to\nhuman­beings.   Hence,   they   take   within   their\nsweep Hijras/Transgenders and are not as such\nlimited   to   male   or   female   gender.   Gender\nidentity as already indicated forms the core\nof   one's personal   self,   based   on   self\nidentification,   not   on   surgical   or   medical\nprocedure.   Gender   identity,   in   our   view,   is\nan integral part of sex and no citizen can be\ndiscriminated   on   the   ground   of   gender\nidentity,   including   those   who   identify   as\nthird gender. ”\n\n129.   This   Court   having   recognised   the   right   of\ntransgenders   to   their   self­identity   in   which\n\ntransgenders also feel pride as human being, the mere\n\nfact that under Enrolment and Update Regulations they\n\nare   required   to   provide   demographic   information\n\nregarding gender does not, in any manner, affect their\n\nright of privacy. There is no expectation of right of\n\nprivacy   with   regard   to   gender.   The   aforesaid   right\n\nhaving   been   clearly   recognised   by   this   Court,\n\nexpression   of   those   rights   of   self­identification\n\ncannot, in any  manner, be said to affect  their  right\n\nto   privacy.   We,   thus,   conclude   that   with   regard   to\n\ntransgenders   also   no   right   of   privacy   is   breached   in\n\ngiving   the   demographic   information.\nIn   so   far   as\n\nbiometric   information   as   held   above,   ample\n\njustification has been found which satisfied the three\n\nfold   test as   laid   down   in\nPuttaswamy\ncase,  which   is\n\nequally applicable to transgender also.\n\n130.   Now,   we   come   to   the   biometric   information   as\n\nreferred to in\nSection 2(g)\nand required to be  given\n\nin   the   process   of   enrolment   by   a   person.     Biometric\n\ninformation means photographs, fingerprints, iris scan\nand   other   such   biometric   attributes   of   an   individual\n\nas   may   be   specified   by   the   regulations.   Biometric\n\ninformations   are   of   physical   characteristics   of   a\n\nperson.   A   person   has   full   bodily   autonomy   and   any\n\nintrusion   in   the   bodily   autonomy   of   a   person   can   be\n\nreadily accepted as breach of his privacy.   In  Regina\n\n(Wood)   Vs.   Commissioner   of   Police   of   the   Metropolis\n\n(supra), in paragraph 21, following has been laid down\n\nby Lord LJ.:­\n\n“21.   The   notion   of   the   personal   autonomy   of\nevery individual marches with the presumption\nof   liberty   enjoyed   in   a   free   polity:   a\npresumption   which   consists   in   the   principle\nthat   every   interference   with   the   freedom   of\nthe   individual   stands   in   need   of   objective\njustification.   Applied   to   the   myriad\ninstances   recognised   in   the\nArticle   8\n\njurisprudence,   this   presumption   means   that,\nsubject to the qualifications I shall shortly\ndescribe,   an   individual's   personal   autonomy\nmakes him ­ should make him ­ master of all\nthose   facts   about   his   own   identity,   such   as\nhis   name,   health,   sexuality,   ethnicity,   his\nown image, of which the cases speak; and also\nof   the   \"zone   of   interaction\"   (the   Von\nHannover   case   40   EHRR   I,   paragraph   50)\nbetween   himself   and   others.   He   is   the\npresumed   owner   of   these   aspects   of   his   own\nself;   his   control   of   them   can   only   be\nloosened,   abrogated,   if   the   State   shows   an\nobjective   justification   for   doing   so.”\n131.   U.S. Supreme Court in  United States Vs. Antonio\n\nDionisio,   35   L.Ed.   2D   67  had   occasion   to   consider\n\nphysical characteristic of a person's voice in context\n\nof   violation   of   privacy   rights.   With   regard   to\n\nfingerprints,   it   was   noticed   that   the   fingerprinting\n\nitself   involves   none   of   the   probing   into   an\n\nindividual's   private   life.     In   paragraph   Nos.   21,   22\n\nfollowing was stated:­\n\n“[21,22]  In Katz v. United States, supra, we\nsaid   that   the   Fourth   Amendment   provides   no\nprotection   for   what   “a   person   knowingly\nexposes  to  the   public,  even  in  his   own  home\nor office . . ..” 389 U.S., at 351, 19 L Ed\n2d   576.   The   physical   characteristics   of   a\nperson's   voice,   its   tone   and   manner,   as\nopposed   to   the   content   of   a   specific\nconversation,   are   constantly   exposed   to   the\npublic.  Like   a  man's   facial  characteristics,\nor   handwriting,   his   voice   is   repeatedly\nproduced   for   others   to   hear.   No   person   can\nhave   a   reasonable   expectation   that   others\nwill   not   know   the   sound   of   his   voice,   any\nmore   than   he   can   reasonably   expect   that   his\nface will be a mystery to the world. As the\nCourt   of   Appeals   for   the   Second   Circuit\nstated:\n\n“Except   for   the   rare   recluse   who\nchooses to live his life in complete\nsolitude,   in   our   daily   lives   we\nconstantly speak and write, and while\nthe   content   of   a   communication   is\nentitled   to   Fourth   Amendment\nprotection   .   .   .   the   underlying\nidentifying   characteristics—the\nconstant   factor   throughout   both\npublic and private communications—are\nopen for all to see or hear. There is\nno   basis   for   constructing   a wall   of\nprivacy against the grand jury which\ndoes   not   exist   in   casual   contacts\nwith   strangers.   Hence   no   intrusion\ninto an individual's privacy results\nfrom   compelled   execution   of\nhandwriting   or   voice   exemplars;\n\nnothing is being exposed to the grand\njury   that   has   not   previously   been\nexposed   to   the   public   at   large.”'\nUnited States v. Doe (Schwartz), 457\nF2d, at 898­899.\n\nThe   required   disclosure   of   a   person's   voice\nis thus immeasurably further removed from the\nFourth   Amendment   protection   than   was   the\nintrusion into the body effected by the blood\nextraction   in   Schmerber.   “The   interests   in\nhuman   dignity   and   privacy   which   the   Fourth\nAmendment protects forbid any such intrusions\non   the   mere   chance   that   desired   evidence\nmight   be   obtained.”  Schmerber   v.   California,\n384 US, at 769­770, 16L Ed 2d 908. Similarly,\na seizure of voice exemplars does not involve\nthe   “severe,   though   brief,   intrusion   upon\ncherished personal security,” effected by the\n“pat­down”   in   Terry—“surely   .   .   .   an\nannoying, frightening and perhaps humiliating\nexperience.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 US, at 24­25,\n20   L   Ed   2d   889. Rather,   this   is   like   the\nfingerprinting   in   Davis,   where,   though   the\ninitial   dragnet   detentions   were\nconstitutionally impermissible, we noted that\nthe   fingerprinting   itself   “involves   none   of\nthe probing into an individual's private life\nand   thoughts   that   marks   an   interrogation   or\nsearch.”   Davis   v.   Mississippi,   394   US,   at\n727,   22   L   Ed   2d   676:   cf.   Thom   v.   New   York\nStock Exchange, 306 F Supp 1002, 1009.”\n\n132. The petitioners have relied upon S. and Marper Vs.\n\nThe   United   Kingdom,  a   judgment   of   Grand   Chamber   of\n\nEuropean   Court   of   Human   Rights   dated   04.12.2008.\n\nEuropean   Court   of   Human   Rights   on   an   application\n\nsubmitted by Mr. S and Mr. Marper allowed their claim\n\nof   violation   of\nArticle   8\nof   Convention.     Applicants\n\nhad   complained   that   the   authorities   had   continued   to\n\nretain their fingerprints and cellular samples and DNA\n\nprofiles   after   the   criminal   proceedings   against   them\n\nhad ended with an acquittal or had been discontinued.\n\nIn   the   above   context,   nature   of   fingerprints   and   DNA\n\nsamples came to be examined in reference of breach of\n\nArticle   8\nof   the   Convention.     The   retention   of   DNA\n\nsamples   and   fingerprints   was   held   to   be   interference\n\nwith   the   right   to   respect   for   private   life.     In\n\nparagraph 84, following was held:­\n\n“84.   The   Court   is   of   the   view   that   the\ngeneral   approach   taken   by   the   Convention\norgans   in   respect   of   photographs   and   voice\nsamples should also be followed in respect of\nfingerprints.   The   Government   distinguished\nthe   latter   by   arguing   that   they   constituted\nneutral,   objective   and   irrefutable   material\nand,   unlike   photographs,   were   unintelligible\nto the untutored eye and without a comparator\nfingerprint.   While   true,   this   consideration\ncannot   alter   the   fact   that   fingerprints\nobjectively   contain   unique   information   about\nthe individual concerned allowing his or her\nidentification with precision in a wide range\nof   circumstances.   They   are   thus   capable   of\naffecting   his   or   her   private   life   and\nretention   of   this   information   without   the\nconsent of the individual concerned cannot be\nregarded as neutral or insignificant.”\n\n133. One important observation, which has been made in\n\nthe   above case   was   that   on   the   question   whether   the\n\npersonal   information   retained   by   the   authorities\n\ninvolves   any   of   the   private­life   aspects,   due   regard\n\nhas to be given to the specific context in which the\n\ninformation at issue has been recorded.  Following was\n\nstated in paragraph 67:­\n\n“67............... However,   in   determining\nwhether  the  personal   information   retained   by\nthe authorities involves any of the private­\nlife aspects mentioned above, the Court will\nhave   due   regard   to   the   specific   context   in\nwhich   the   information   at   issue   has   been\nrecorded   and   retained,   the   nature   of   the\nrecords,   the   way   in   which   these   records   are\nused   and   processed   and   the   results   that   may\nbe   obtained   (see,  mutatis   mutandis,   Friedl,\ncited above, §§49­51, and Peck v. the United\nKingdom, cited above, §59).”\n134.    The   biometric   data   as   referred   to   in\nSection\n\n2(g)\nthus   may   contain   biological   attributes   of   an\n\nindividual with regard to which a person can very well\n\nclaim a reasonable expectation of privacy but whether\n\nprivacy rights have been  breached or  not needs to be\n\nexamined   in   the   subject   context   under   which   the\n\ninformations were obtained.\n\n135.   Having   found   that   biometric   information   of   a\n\nperson may claim a reasonable expectation of privacy,\n\nwe   have   to   answer   as   to   whether   obtaining   biometric\n\ninformation in context of enrolment breaches the right\n\nof privacy of individual or not.\n\n136.   D.Y.  Chandrachud,  J.  in\nPuttaswamy\n(supra)  held\n\nthat all restraints on privacy, i.e. whether a person\n\nhas   reasonable   expectation   of   privacy,   must   fulfill\n\nthree   requirements   before   a   restraint   can   be   held   to\n\nbe   justified.     In   Paragraph   319,   following   has been\n\nheld:­\n\n“310.   While   it   intervenes   to   protect\nlegitimate   state   interests,   the   state   must\nnevertheless   put   into   place   a   robust   regime\nthat   ensures   the   fulfillment   of   a   threefold\nrequirement.   These   three   requirements   apply\nto   all   restraints   on   privacy   (not   just\ninformational privacy). They emanate from the\nprocedural   and   content­based   mandate   of\n\nArticle 21.\nThe first requirement that there\nmust   be   a   law   in   existence   to   justify   an\nencroachment   on   privacy   is   an   express\nrequirement of\nArticle 21.\nFor, no person can\nbe   deprived   of   his   life   or   personal   liberty\nexcept   in   accordance   with   the   procedure\nestablished   by   law.   The   existence   of   law   is\nan   essential   requirement.   Second,   the\nrequirement   of   a   need,   in   terms   of   a\nlegitimate state aim, ensures that the nature\nand   content   of   the   law   which   imposes   the\nrestriction   falls   within   the   zone   of\nreasonableness   mandated  by\nArticle   14\n,   which\nis   a   guarantee   against   arbitrary   State\naction. The pursuit of a legitimate state aim\nensures   that   the   law   does   not   suffer   from\nmanifest   arbitrariness.   Legitimacy,   as   a\npostulate,   involves   a   value   judgment.\n\nJudicial   review   does   not   re­appreciate   or\nsecond   guess   the   value   judgment   of   the\nlegislature   but   is   for   deciding   whether   the\naim   which   is   sought   to   be   pursued   suffers\nfrom   palpable   or   manifest   arbitrariness.   The\nthird   requirement   ensures   that   the   means\nwhich   are adopted   by   the   legislature   are\nproportional   to   the   object   and   needs   sought\nto   be   fulfilled   by   the   law.   Proportionality\nis   an   essential   facet   of   the   guarantee\nagainst   arbitrary   State   action because   it\nensures   that   the   nature   and   quality   of   the\nencroachment   on   the   right   is   not\ndisproportionate   to   the   purpose   of   the   law.\n\nHence, the threefold requirement for a valid\nlaw arises out of the mutual inter­dependence\nbetween   the   fundamental   guarantees   against\narbitrariness   on   the   one   hand   and   the\nprotection   of   life   and   personal   liberty,   on\nthe other. The right to privacy, which is an\nintrinsic   part   of   the   right   to   life   and\nliberty,   and   the   freedoms   embodied   in   Part\nIII   is   subject   to   the   same   restraints   which\napply to those freedoms. ”\n\n137.  We, thus, have to test the provisions of Aadhaar\n\nAct in light of three­fold test as have been laid down\n\nabove.     The   First   requirement,   which   need   to   be\n\nfulfilled   is   existence   of   law.     Admittedly,   Aadhaar\n\nAct is a Parliamentary law, hence the existence of law\n\nis   satisfied.     Mere   existence   of   law   may   not   be\n\nsufficient unless the law is fair and reasonable.  The\n\nAadhaar   Act   has   been   enacted   with   an   object   of\n\nproviding   Aadhaar   number   to   individuals   for\n\nidentifying   an   individual   for   delivery   of   benefits,\n\nsubsidies   and   services.   Several   materials   have   been\n\nbrought   on   the   record   which   reflect   that   in   the\n\nseveral studies initiated by the Government as well as\n\nthe   World   Bank   and   Planning   Commission,   it   was\n\nrevealed   that   food   grains   released   by   the   Government\n\nfor   the   beneficiaries   did   not   reach   the   intended\n\nbeneficiaries   and   there   was   large   scale   leakages   due\n\nto   the   failure   to   establish   identity.     Reference   to\nAudit   Report   No.   3   of 2000   of   Comptroller   &   Auditor\n\nGeneral of India is made in this regard.  The Planning\n\nCommission   of   India   in   its   Performance   Evaluation\n\nReport   titled   “Performance   Evaluation   Report   of\n\nTargeted   Public   Distribution   System(TPDS)”   dated\n\nMarch, 2005 found as follows:­\n\nI. State­wise   figure   of   excess   Ration   Cards   in\n\nvarious states and the existence of over 1.52\n\nCrore excess Ration Cards issued.\n\nII. Existence   of fictitious   households   and\n\nidentification errors leading to exclusion of\n\ngenuine beneficiaries.\n\nIII. Leakage through ghost BPL Ration Cards found\n\nto   be   prevalent   in   almost   all   the   States\n\nunder study.\n\nIV. The   leakage   of   food   grains   through   ghost\n\ncards   has   been   tabulated   and   the   percentage\n\nof   such   leakage   on   an   All   India   basis   has\n\nbeen estimated at 16.67%.\n\nV. It   is   concluded   that   a   large   part   of   the\n\nsubsidized   food­grains   were  not  reaching   the\ntarget group.\n\n138.   The   Law,   i.e.,   Aadhaar   Act,   which   has   been\n\nbrought to provide for unique identity for delivery of\n\nsubsidies, benefits or services was a dire necessity,\n\nwhich   decision   was   arrived   at   after   several   reports\n\nand   studies.     Aadhaar   Act   was,   thus,   enacted   for   a\n\nlegitimate   State   aim   and   fulfills   the   criteria   of   a\n\nlaw   being   fair   and   reasonable.     Learned   Attorney\n\nGeneral   has   also   placed   reliance   on   report   of   United\n\nNations titled “Leaving No One Behind: the imperative\n\nof   inclusive   development”,   which   has   stated   as\n\nfollows:­\n\n“The decision of India in 2010 to launch the\nAadhaar   programme   to   enrol   the   biometric\nidentifying   data   of   all   its   1.2   billion\ncitizens, for example, was a critical step in\nenabling   fairer   access   of   the   people   to\ngovernment benefits and services.  Programmes\nsuch as Aadhaar have tremendous potential to\nfoster   inclusion   by   giving   all   people,\nincluding   the   poorest   and   most   marginalized,\nan   official   identify.     Fair   and   robust\nsystems   of   legal   identity   and   birth\nregistration   are   recognised   in   the   new   2030\nAgenda   for   Sustainable   Development   as   an\nimportant   foundation   for   promoting   inclusive\nsocieties.”\n139.   Learned   Attorney   General   has   also   relied   on\n\nResolution   of   the   United   Nations   General   Assembly\n\ndated   25.09.2015   titled   “Transforming   our   World:   the\n\n2030   Agenda   for   Sustainable   Development”.   It   is\n\nsubmitted   that   by   the   said   resolution,   the   following\n\ngoal was adopted”­\n\n“16.9   by   2030,   provide   legal   identity   for\nall, including birth registration”\n\n140. In this context, judgment of U.S. Supreme Court in\n\nOtis R. Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n\net al. Vs. Stephen J. Roy et al., 476 U.S. 693 (1986)\n\nis   referred   where   the   statutory   requirement   that   an\n\napplicant   provide   a   social   security   number   as   a\n\ncondition of eligibility for the benefits in question\n\nwas   held   to   be   not   violative.     It   was   held   that\n\nrequirement   is   facially   neutral   in   religious   terms,\n\napplies   to   all   applicants   for   the   benefits   involved,\n\nand clearly promotes a legitimate and important public\n\ninterest.   Chief Justice Burger writing the opinion of\n\nthe Court stated:­\n\n“The   general   governmental   interests   involved\nhere   buttress   this   conclusion.   Governments\ntoday   grant   a   broad   range   of   benefits;\n\ninescapably   at   the   same   time   the\nadministration   of   complex   programs   requires\ncertain conditions and restrictions. Although\nin some situations a mechanism for individual\nconsideration   will   be   created,   a   policy\ndecision   by   a   government   that   it   wishes   to\ntreat   all   applicants   alike   and   that   it   does\nnot   wish   to   become   involved   in   case­by­case\ninquiries   into   the   genuineness   of   each\nreligious   objection   to   such   condition   or\nrestrictions   is   entitled   to   substantial\ndeference. Moreover, legitimate interests are\nimplicated   in   the   need   to   avoid   any\nappearance   of   favoring   religious   over\nnonreligious applicants.\n\nThe   test   applied   in   cases   like   Wisconsin   v.\n\nYoder,   406   U.\nS.   205\n,\nS.Ct.   1526,   32\nL.Ed.2d 15 (1972), is not appropriate in this\nsetting.   In   the   enforcement   of   a   facially\nneutral   and   uniformly   applicable   requirement\nfor   the   administration   of   welfare   programs\nreaching   many   millions   of   people,   the\nGovernment is entitled to wide latitude. The\nGovernment   should   not   be   put   to   the   strict\ntest   applied   by   the   District   Court;   that\nstandard   required   the   Government   to   justify\nenforcement   of   the   use   of   Social   Security\nnumber   requirement   as   the   least   restrictive\nmeans   of   accomplishing   a   compelling   state\ninterest.   Absent   proof   of   an   intent   to\ndiscriminate   against   particular   religious\nbeliefs   or   against   religion   in   general,   the\nGovernment   meets   its   burden   when   it\ndemonstrates   that   a   challenged   requirement\nfor   governmental   benefits,   neutral   and\nuniform   in   its   application,   is   a   reasonable\nmeans   of   promoting   a   legitimate   public\ninterest. ”\n141. Repelling   an   argument   that   requirement   of\n\nproviding social security account number for obtaining\n\nfinancial aid to dependent children violates the right\n\nto   privacy,   following   was   held   in  Doris   McElrath   Vs.\n\nJoseph A. Califano, in Para 11 :­\n\n“[11] The appellants' principal contention on\nappeal   is   that   the   federal   and   state\nregulations   requiring   dependent   children   to\nacquire   and   submit   social   security   account\nnumbers   as   a   condition   of   eligibility   for\nAFDC   benefits   are   statutorily   invalid   as\nbeing inconsistent with and not authorized by\nthe\nSocial   Security   Act\n.   We   find   the\narguments   advanced   in   support   of   this\ncontention to be without merit and hold that\nthe   challenged   regulations   constitute   a\nlegitimate   condition   of   eligibility   mandated\nby   the   Congress   under   the\nSocial   Security\nAct\n. Accord, Chambers v. Klein, 419 F. Supp.\n\n569   (D.N.J.   1976),   aff'd   mem.,   564   F.2d   89\n(3d Cir. 1977); Green v. Philbrook, 576 F.2d\n440   (2d   Cir.   1978);   Arthur   v.   Department   of\nSocial and Health Services, 19 Wn. App. 542,\n576   P.2d   921   (1978).   We   therefore   conclude\nthat   the   district   court   properly   dismissed\nthe   appellants'   statutory   invalidity\nallegations for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. ”\n\n142. Now,   we   come   to   third   test,   i.e.,   test   of\n\nproportionality.   D.Y.   Chandrachud,   J.   in\nPuttaswamy\n\n(supra)  has observed “Proportionality is an essential\n\nfacet of the guarantee against arbitrary State action\nbecause it ensures that the nature and quality of the\n\nencroachment   on   the   right   is   not   disproportionate   to\n\nthe purpose of the law”.\n\nIn\nModern Dental College and\n\nResearch Centre and Others Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\nand Others\n, (2016) 7 SCC 353, Dr. Sikri, J explaining\n\nthe concept of proportionality laid down following in\n\nParagraphs 64 and 65:­\n\n“64.   The   exercise   which,   therefore,   to   be\ntaken   is   to   find   out   as   to   whether   the\nlimitation of constitutional rights is for a\npurpose that is reasonable and necessary in a\ndemocratic   society   and   such   an   exercise\ninvolves   the   weighing   up   of   competitive\nvalues, and ultimately an assessment based on\nproportionality   i.e.   balancing   of   different\ninterests.\n\n65.   We   may   unhesitatingly   remark   that   this\ndoctrine   of   Proportionality,   explained\nhereinabove in brief, is enshrined in\nArticle\nitself when we read Clause (1) along with\nClause (6) thereof. While defining as to what\nconstitutes   a   reasonable   restriction,   this\nCourt in plethora of judgments has held that\nthe expression “reasonable restriction” seeks\nto   strike   a   balance   between   the   freedom\nguaranteed   by   any   of   the   sub­clauses   of\nClause   (1)   of\nArticle   19\nand   the   social\ncontrol   permitted   by   any   of   the   clauses   (2)\nto   (6).   It   is   held   that   the   expression\n“reasonable”   connotes   that   the   limitation\nimposed  on  a  person  in   the  enjoyment  of  the\nright   should   not   be   arbitrary   or   of   an\nexcessive   nature   beyond   what   is   required   in\nthe interests of public. Further, in order to\nbe   reasonable,   the   restriction   must   have   a\nreasonable   relation   to   the   object   which   the\nlegislation seeks to achieve, and must not go\nin   excess   of   that   object   {See   P.P.\nEnterprises   v.   Union   of   India   (1982)   2   SCC\n\n33.   At   the   same   time,   reasonableness   of   a\nrestriction   has   to   be   determined   in   an\nobjective   manner   and   from   the   standpoint   of\nthe   interests   of   the   general   public   and   not\nfrom   the   point   of   view   of   the   persons   upon\nwhom   the   restrictions   are   imposed   or   upon\nabstract   considerations   {See\nMohd.   Hanif\nQuareshi v. State of Bihar\n1959 SCR 629).\n\nIn\n\nM.R.F. Ltd. v. State of Kerala\n(1998) 8 SCC\n227,   this   Court   held   that   in   examining   the\nreasonableness   of   a   statutory   provision   one\nhas to keep in mind the following factors:\n\n(1) The directive principles of State\nPolicy.\n\n(2)   Restrictions   must   not   be\narbitrary   or   of   an   excessive   nature\nso as to go beyond the requirement of\nthe interest of the general public.\n\n(3)   In   order   to   judge   the\nreasonableness   of   the   restrictions,\nno   abstract   or   general   pattern   or   a\nfixed   principle   can   be   laid down   so\nas to be of universal application and\nthe same will vary from case to case\nas   also   with   regard   to   changing\nconditions,   values   of   human   life,\nsocial   philosophy   of   the\nConstitution,   prevailing   conditions\nand the surrounding circumstances.\n\n(4) A just balance has to be struck\nbetween the restrictions imposed and\nthe   social   control   envisaged   by\n\nArticle 19(6).\n(5) Prevailing social values as also\nsocial needs which are intended to be\nsatisfied by the restrictions.\n\n(6)   There   must   be   a   direct   and\nproximate   nexus   or   reasonable\nconnection   between   the   restrictions\nimposed   and   the   object   sought   to   be\nachieved. If there is a direct nexus\nbetween   the   restrictions,   and   the\nobject   of   the   Act,   then   a   strong\npresumption   in   favour   the\nconstitutionality   of   the   Act   will\nnaturally arise. ”\n\n143.   One   of   the   submissions   of   the   petitioner   to\n\ncontend that proportionality test is not fulfilled in\n\nthe   present   case   is;   State   did   not   adopt   an\n\nalternative   and   more   suitable   and   least   intrusive\n\nmethod   of   identification,   i.e.,   smart   card   or   other\n\nsimilar devices.   While examining the proportionality\n\nof   a   Statute,   it   has   to   be   kept   in   mind   that   the\n\nStatute   is   neither   arbitrary   nor   of   an   excessive\n\nnature   beyond   what   is   required   in   the   interest   of\n\npublic.   The Statutory scheme, which has been brought\n\nin place has a reasonable relation to the object which\n\nthe   legislation   seeks   to   achieve   and   the   legislation\n\ndoes not exceed the object.  The object of Aadhaar Act\nas   noticed   above   was   to   provide   for   unique   identity\n\nfor   purposes   of   delivery   of   benefits, subsidies   and\n\nservices to the eligible beneficiaries and to ward of\n\nmisappropriation   of   benefits   and   subsidies,   ward   of\n\ndeprivation of eligible beneficiaries.  European Court\n\nof   Justice   has   taken   a   view   that   the   proportionality\n\nmerely involves an assessment that the measures taken\n\nwas not more than necessary.  Reference is made to the\n\njudgment   of Digital   Rights   Ireland   Ltd.   Vs.   Minister\n\nfor Communications [2015] QBECJ, wherein it was held:\n\n“46 In that regard, according to the settled\ncase   law   of   the   court,   the   principle   of\nproportionality requires that acts of the EU\ninstitutions be appropriate for attaining the\nlegitimate   objectives   pursued   by   the\nlegislation   at   issue   and   do   not   exceed   the\nlimits   of   what   is   appropriate   and   necessary\nin   order   to   achieve   those   objectives:   see\nAfton   Chemical   Ltd   v   Secretary   of   State   for\nTransport   (Case  C­343/09)   [2010]   ECR   I­7027,\npara 45; the Volker case [2010] ECR I­11063,\npara   74;   Nelson   v   Deutsche   Lufthansa   AG\n(Joined Cases C­581/10 and C­629/10) [2013] 1\nAll   ER

 EU:C:2013:66I;   17   October   2013,  para\n\n29.”\n\n144.   United   Kingdom   Supreme   Court   in  AB   Vs.   Her\nMajesty's Advocate, [2017]  UK SC 25, held  that it  is\n\nnot   for   the   Court   to   identify   the   alternative\n\nmeasures,   which   may   be   least   intrusive.     In   Para   37\n\nand 39, following has been held:­\n\n“37.  I  am   not  persuaded.  It   is  important  to\nrecall   that   the   question   of   whether   the\nParliament   could   have   used   a   less   intrusive\nmeasure   does   not   involve   the   court   in\nidentifying  the  alternative  measure  which   is\nleast   intrusive.   The   court   allows   the\nlegislature   a   margin   of   discretion   and   asks\nwhether the limitation on the\narticle 8\nright\nis   one   which   it   was   reasonable   for   the\nParliament   to   propose:   Bank   Mellat   v   HM\nTreasury   (No   2)   [2013]   UKSC   38,   [2014]   AC\n700, para 75 per Lord Reed;\n\n39. The balance, which this court is enjoined\nto address, is different. It is the question\nof a fair balance between the public interest\nand the individual's right to respect for his\nor   her   private   life   under\narticle   8.\nThe\nquestion   for   the   court   is,   in   other   words,\nwhether   the   impact   of   the   infringement   of\nthat right is proportionate, having regard to\nthe   likely   benefit   of   the   impugned\nprovision.”\n\n145.   The biometric information which are obtained for\n\nAadhaar   enrolment   are   photographs,   fingerprints   and\n\niris   scan,   which   are   least   intrusion   in   physical\n\nautonomy of an individual.  U.S. Supreme Court in\nJohn\n\nDavis   Vs.   State   of   Mississippi\n,   394   US   721   (1969),\nindicated   that   Fingerprinting   involves   none   of   the\n\nprobing into an individual's private life and thoughts\n\nthat   marks   an   interrogation   or   search.     The   physical\n\nprocess   by   which   the   fingerprints   are   taken   does   not\n\nrequire   information   beyond   the   object   and   purpose.\n\nTherefore, it does not readily offend those principles\n\nof dignity and privacy, which are fundamental to each\n\nlegislation of due process.   One of the apprehension,\n\nwhich   was   expressed   by   petitioners   that   since   as   per\n\ndefinition   of   biometric   information   contained   in\n\nSection   2(g)\n,   further,   biological   attributes   of   an\n\nindividual may be specified by regulations, which may\n\nbe   more   intrusive.\nSection   2(g)\nuse   the   word   “such\n\nbiological attributes”.  Thus, applying the principles\n\nof   ejusdem   generis,   the   biological   attributes   can   be\n\nadded by the regulations, has to be akin to one those\n\nmentioned   in\nSection   2(g)\n,   i.e.   photographs,\n\nfingerprints and iris scan.  In event, such biological\n\nattributes is added by regulations, it is always open\n\nto   challenge   by   appropriate   proceedings   but   the   mere\n\nfact that by regulations any such biometric attributes\ncan   be   added,   there   is   no   reason   to   accept   the\n\ncontention   that   biological   attributes,   which   can   be\n\nadded may be disproportionate to the objective of the\n\nAct.     Biometric   information,   thus,   which   is   to   be\n\nobtained   for   enrolment   are   not   disproportionate   nor\n\nthe   provisions   of   Aadhaar   Act   requiring   demographic\n\nand   biometric   information   can   be   said   to   be   not\n\npassing   three­fold   test   as\nlaid   down   in\n\nPuttaswamy\n\n(supra)  case.   We, thus, answer Issue Nos. 1 and 2 in\n\nfollowing manner:­\n\nAns.1 and 2:­   (i) requirement   under   Aadhaar   Act\n\nto give one's  demographic   and\n\nbiometric information does not  violate\n\nfundamental right of privacy.\n\n(ii) The   provisions   of   Aadhaar   Act   requiring\n\ndemographic   and   biometric   information\n\nfrom a  resident   for   Aadhaar   Number\n\npass   three­fold   test   as\nlaid   down   in\n\nPuttaswamy\n(supra)  case, hence cannot\n\nbe said to be unconstitutional.\nISSUE NOS.3,4 COLLECTION,   STORAGE,

contemplates   that   biometric\n\ninformation   are   sensitive   personal   data   or\n\ninformation. There are strict conditions envisaged in\n\nSection   33\nfor   disclosure   of   information.   The\ndisclosure of information is contemplated only on two\n\ncontingencies.   Firstly,   when   an   order   is   passed   by   a\n\nCourt   not   inferior   to   that   of   District   Judge   and\n\nsecondly   when   the   disclosure   is   made   in   the   interest\n\nof   national   security   in   pursuance   of   a   direction   of\n\nthe officer not below the rank of Joint Secretary to\n\nthe Government of India.\n\n149.\nChapter   VII   of   the   Act\ndeals   with   the   offences\n\nand   penalties   for   impersonation

imprisonment   for   a   term\nwhich may extend to one year or with a fine\nwhich   may   extend   to   twenty­five   thousand\nrupees or, in the case of a company, with a\nfine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or\nwith both.”\n\n150.   Regulations   have   been   framed   under   the   Act,\n\nnamely,   (1)   The   Aadhaar   (Enrolment   and   Update)\n\nRegulations,   2016,   (2)   The   Aadhaar   (Authentication)\n\nRegulations,   2016,   (3)   The   Aadhaar   (Data   Security)\n\nRegulations,   2016   and   (4)   The   Aadhaar   (Sharing   of\n\nInformation) Regulations, 2016.\n\n151.   We have already noticed the detailed submissions\n\nof   learned   counsel   for   UIDAI.   Following   are   the\n\nmeasures by which     Security   Data   of   privacy   is\n\nensured. The   security and data privacy is ensured in\n\nthe following manner:­\n\ni. The   data   sent   to   ABIS   is   completely\nanonymised. The ABIS systems do not have\naccess   to   resident’s   demographic\ninformation  as   they   are   only   sent\nbiometric information  of a resident with\na reference number and  asked   to   de­\nduplicate. The de­duplication result with\nthe reference number is mapped  back   to\nthe   correct   enrolment   number   by   the\nAuthorities own enrolment server.\n\nii. The   ABIS   providers   only   provide   their\nsoftware and services. The data is stored\nin  UIDAI   storage   and   it   never   leaves\nthe secure  premises.\n\niii. The   ABIS   providers   do   not   store   the\nbiometric  images   (source).   They   only\nstore template for  the purpose of de­\nduplication (with reference number)\niv. The   encrypted   enrolment   packet   sent   by\nthe  enrolment   client   software   to   the\nCIDRis  decrypted   by   the   enrolment\nserver but the  decrypted   packet   is\nnever stored.\n\nv. The   original   biometric   images   of\nfingerprints, iris and face are archived\nand  stored   offline.   Hence,   they   cannot\nbe  accessed through an online network.\n\nvi. The   biometric   system   provides   high\naccuracy  of   over   99.86%.   The   mixed\nbiometric have been  adopted   only   to\nenhance   the   accuracy   and   to   reduce   the\nerrors which may arise on account of some\nresidents either not having biometrics or\nnot having some particular  biometric.\n\n152. After   the   enrolment   and   allotting   an   Aadhaar\n\nnumber   to   individual   the   main   function   of   the\n\nauthority   is   authentication   of   an   Aadhaar   number\nholder  as and when request  is made  by the requesting\n\nagency.   The   authentication   facility   provided   by   the\n\nauthority   is   under\nSection   3\nof   the   Authentication\n\nRegulations, 2016 which is to the following effect:\n\n“3. Types of Authentication.—\nThere shall be two types of authentication\nfacilities   provided   by   the   Authority,\nnamely—\n\n(i)   Yes/No   authentication   facility,\nwhich   may   be   carried   out   using   any   of\nthe modes specified in regulation 4(2);\n\nand\n\n(ii)   e­KYC   authentication   facility,\nwhich may be carried out only using OTP\nand/   or   biometric   authentication   modes\nas specified in regulation 4(2).”\n\n153.   Various  modes  of  authentication  are  provided  in\n\nRegulation 4\nof Authentication Regulations 2016, which\n\nare:   Demographic   authentification;   One   time   pin­based\n\nauthentication;   Biometric­based   authentification   and\n\nMulti­factor authentification. A requesting entity may\n\nchoose suitable mode of authentication for particular\n\nfunction or business function as per its requirement.\n154.\nRegulation   7\nprovides   for   capturing   biometric\n\ninformation   by   requesting   entity   which   is   to   the\n\nfollowing effect:\n\n“7.   Capturing   of   biometric   information   by\nrequesting entity.—\n(1)   A   requesting   entity   shall   capture   the\nbiometric   information   of   the   Aadhaar   number\nholder   using   certified   biometric   devices   as\nper   the   processes   and   specifications\nlaid\ndown by\nthe Authority.\n\n(2)   A   requesting   entity   shall   necessarily\nencrypt and secure the biometric data at the\ntime   of   capture   as   per   the   specifications\n\nlaid down by\nthe Authority.\n\n(3)   For   optimum   results   in   capturing   of\nbiometric   information,   a   requesting   entity\nshall adopt the processes as may be specified\nby   the  Authority  from  time   to  time   for  this\npurpose.”\n\n155.\nRegulation   9\ndeals   with   process   of   sending\n\nauthentification   requests.   Sub­Regulation   (1)   of\n\nRegulation 9\ncontends the safe method of transmission\n\nof the authentication requests.\n\n156.   The   Aadhaar   (Data   Security)   Regulations,   2016\n\ncontain   detail   provisions   to   ensuring   data   security.\n\nRegulation   3\ndeals   with   measures   for   ensuring\n\ninformation   security.\nRegulation   5\nprovides   security\nobligations of the agencies, consultants, advisors and\n\nother   service   providers   engaged   by   the   Authority   for\n\ndischarging any function relating to its processes.\n\n157. The Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations,\n\n2016   also   contain   provisions   providing   for\n\nrestrictions   on   sharing   identity   information.   Sub­\n\nRegulation   (1)   of\nRegulation   3\nprovides   that   core\n\nbiometric information collected by the Authority under\n\nthe Act shall not be shared with anyone for any reason\n\nwhatsoever.\n\n158.   Sharing   of   Information   Regulations,   2016   also\n\ncontain   various   other   restrictions.\nRegulation   6\n\ncontains   restrictions   on   sharing,   circulating   or\n\npublishing of Aadhaar number which is to the following\n\neffect:\n\n“6.  Restrictions   on   sharing,   circulating   or\npublishing of Aadhaar number. —\n(1) The Aadhaar number of an individual shall\nnot   be   published,   displayed   or   posted\npublicly by any person or entity or agency.\n(2)   Any   individual,   entity   or   agency,   which\nis   in   possession   of   Aadhaar   number(s)   of\nAadhaar number holders, shall ensure security\nand   confidentiality   of   the   Aadhaar   numbers\nand of any record or database containing the\nAadhaar numbers.\n\n(3)  Without  prejudice   to   sub­regulations   (1)\nand   (2),   no   entity,   including   a   requesting\nentity, which is in possession of the Aadhaar\nnumber   of   an   Aadhaar   number   holder,   shall\nmake public any database or record containing\nthe   Aadhaar   numbers   of   individuals,   unless\nthe   Aadhaar   numbers   have   been   redacted   or\nblacked   out   through   appropriate   means,   both\nin print and electronic form.\n\n(4) No entity, including a requesting entity,\nshall   require   an   individual   to   transmit   his\nAadhaar number over the Internet unless such\ntransmission is secure and the Aadhaar number\nis transmitted in encrypted form except where\ntransmission   is   required   for   correction   of\nerrors or redressal of grievances.\n\n(5) No entity, including a requesting entity,\nshall retain Aadhaar numbers or any document\nor   database   containing   Aadhaar   numbers   for\nlonger   than   is   necessary   for   the   purpose\nspecified to the Aadhaar number holder at the\ntime of obtaining consent.”\n\n159.  The scheme of the Aadhaar Act indicates that all\n\nparts   of   the   entire   process   beginning   from   enrolment\n\nof   a   resident   for   allocation of   Aadhaar   number   are\n\nstatutory regulated.\n\n160.   The   Authentication   Regulations,   2016   also   limit\n\nthe period for retention of logs by requesting entity.\nRegulation 18(1)\nwhich is relevant in this context is\n\nas follows:\n\n“18.   Maintenance   of   logs   by   requesting\nentity.­\n(1)   A   requesting   entity   shall   maintain   logs\nof   the   authentication   transactions   processed\nby   it,   containing   the   following   transaction\ndetails, namely:—\n\n(a) the Aadhaar number against which\nauthentication is sought;\n\n(b)   specified   parameters   of\nauthentication request submitted;\n\n(c) specified parameters received as\nauthentication response;\n\n(d)   the   record   of   disclosure   of\ninformation   to   the   Aadhaar   number\nholder at the time of authentication;\n\nand\n\n(e) record of consent of the Aadhaar\nnumber holder for authentication, but\nshall   not,   in   any   event,   retain   the\nPID information.”\n\n161.   The   residents’   information   in   CIDR   are   also\n\npermitted   to   be   updated   as   per   provisions   of   the\n\nAadhaar   (Enrolment   and   Update)   Regulations,   2016.   An\n\nover view of the entire scheme of functions under the\n\nAadhaar   Act   and   Regulations   made   thereunder   indicate\n\nthat   after   enrolment   of   resident,   his   informations\nincluding   biometric   information   are   retained   in   CIDR\n\nthough   in   encrypted   form.   The   major   function   of   the\n\nauthority   under   Aadhaar   Act   is   authentication   of\n\nidentity   of   Aadhaar   number   holder     as   and   when\n\nrequests   are   made   by   requesting   agency,   retention   of\n\nauthentication   data   of   requesting   agencies   are\n\nretained for limited period as noted above. There are\n\nample safeguards for security and data privacy in the\n\nmechanism which is at place as on date as noted above.\n\n162.   Shri   Shyam   Divan,   learned   senior   counsel\n\nappearing   for   the   petitioners   has   passionately\n\nsubmitted that entire process of authentication as is\n\nclear   from   actual   working   of   the   Aadhaar   programme\n\nreveals that Aadhaar Act enables  the State to put the\n\nentire   population   of   the   country   in   an   electronic\n\nleash   and   they   are   tracked   24   hours   and   7   days.   He\n\nsubmits   that   putting   the   entire   population   under\n\nsurveillance is nothing but converting the State into\n\na    totalitarian   State.   Elaborating   his   submission,\n\nShri   Divan   submits   that   process   of   authentication\n\ncreates   authentication   records   of   (1)   time   of\nauthentication, (2) identity of the requesting entity.\n\nBoth   requesting   entity   and   UIDAI   have   authentication\n\ntransactions   data   which   record   the   technical   details\n\nof   transactions.   The   devices   which   are   used   by   the\n\nrequesting   entities   have   IP   address   which   enables\n\nknowledge   about   geographical   information   of   Aadhaar\n\nnumber holder with knowledge of his location, details\n\nof   transaction,   every   person   can   be   tracked   and   by\n\naggregating the relevant data the entire population is\n\nput   on   constant   surveillance.   Aadhaar   programme\n\nendeavours   all   time   mass   surveillance   by   the   State\n\nwhich   is   undemocratic   and   violates   the   fundamental\n\nrights of individual.\n\n163.   The meta   data   regarding   authentication\n\ntransactions   which   are   stored   with   the   authority   are\n\npotent   enough   to   note   each   and   every   transaction   of\n\nresident   and   to   track   his   activities   is   nothing   but\n\nsurveillance.\nRegulation   26\nof   Authentication\n\nRegulations,   2016   provides   storage   of   meta   data\n\nrelated   to   the   transaction.\nRegulation   26\nwhich   is\n\nrelevant is as follows:\n“26.   Storage   and   Maintenance   of\nAuthentication   Transaction   Data.   —  (1)   The\nAuthority   shall   store   and   maintain\nauthentication   transaction   data,   which   shall\ncontain the following information:—\n\n(a)   authentication   request   data\nreceived including PID block;\n\n(b)   authentication   response   data\nsent;\n\n(c)   meta   data   related   to   the\ntransaction;\n\n(d)   any   authentication   server   side\nconfigurations   as   necessary   Provided\nthat the Authority shall not, in any\ncase,   store   the   purpose   of\nauthentication.”\n\n164. We may first notice as to what is meta data which\n\nis   referred   to   in\nRegulation   26\nabove.   The   UIDAI\n\nreceives   the   requests   for   authentication   of   ANH.   The\n\nrequest   for   authentication   received   by   requesting\n\nagency   does   not   contain   any   information   as   to   the\n\npurpose   of   authentication   neither   requesting   agency\n\nnor   UIDAI   has   any   record   pertaining   to   purpose   for\n\nwhich authentication has been sought by Aadhaar number\n\nholder. The meta data referred to in\nRegulation 26(c)\n\nis only limited technical meta data.\n165.   Shri   Kapil   Sibal   had   submitted   that   CIDR   holds\n\nthe   entire   Aadhaar   database   retained   by   CIDR.   It   has\n\nbecome a soft target for internal/external/ indigenous\n\n/foreign   attacks   and   single   point   of   failure.   Shri\n\nSibal has referred to a RBI report which states:\n\n“Thanks to Aadhaar, for the first time in the\nhistory   of   India,   there   is   now   a   readily\navailable   single   target   for   cyber   criminals\nas well as India’s external enemies. In a few\nyears,   attacking   UIDAI   data   can   potentially\ncripple   Indian   businesses   and   administration\nin   ways   that   were   inconceivable   a   few   years\nago. The loss to the economy and citizens in\ncase   of   such   an   attack   is   bound   to   be\nincalculable.”\n\n166.  He has further submitted that a digital world is\n\nfar more susceptible to manipulation than the physical\n\nworld.   No   legislation   can   or   should   allow   an\n\nindividual’s personal data  to be put  at risk, in the\n\nabsence   of   a   technologically   assured   and   safe\n\nenvironment. Such level of assurance is impossible to\n\nobtain in the digital space. Biometric, core biometric\n\nand   demographic   information   of   an   individual,   once\n\npart   of   the   digital   world   is   irretrievable:   a   genie\n\nout of the bottle that cannot be put back. The digital\n\nworld is a vehicle to benefit the information economy.\nA   move   from   an   information   economy   to   creating   an\n\narchitecture   for   an   information   polity   has   far\n\nreaching   consequences   impacting   the   most   personal\n\nrights,   protected   by   the   right   to   privacy.   The\n\ntechnology   acquired   by   the   UIDAI   has   also   been\n\ncriticised by the Opaque Foreign Technologies.\n\n167.  The above submissions have been strongly refuted\n\nby   learned   Attorney   General   and   learned   counsel\n\nappearing   for   the   UIDAI.   It   is   submitted   by   the\n\nrespondents that the above submissions regarding mass\n\nsurveillance have been made on misconception regarding\n\nactual operation of the entire process.\n\n168. The   meta   data   which   is   aggregation   of\n\nauthentication   transactions   does   not   contain   any\n\ndetail   of   actual   transaction   done   by   ANH.   In   the\n\nevent, in a period of 30 days, 30 requesting agencies,\n\nmay   be   one   or   different,   have   requested   for\n\nauthentication   the   UIDAI   has   only   the   recipient   of\n\ndemographic/biometric   of   ANH   authentication   without\n\nany   information   regarding   purposes   of   authentication.\nThus,   even   if   authentication   details   are   aggregated,\n\nthere   is   no   information   with   the   UIDAI   regarding\n\npurpose   of   authentication   nor   authentication   leaves\n\nfor any trail so as to keep any track by UiDAI to know\n\nthe   nature   of   transaction   or   to   keep   any   kind   of\n\nsurveillance as alleged.\nSection 32\nsub­section (3) of\n\nthe   Aadhaar   Act   specifically   prohibits   the   authority\n\nfrom   collecting   or   maintaining   either   directly   or\n\nindirectly   any   information   for   the   purpose   of\n\nauthentication.\n\n169.     Proviso   to\nRegulation   26\nis   also   to   the   same\n\neffect i.e. provided that the authority shall not, in\n\nany case, store the purpose of authentication.\n\n170.    Elaborating on CIDR, Shri Dwivedi submits that\n\nCIDR   is   a   centralised   database   which   contains   all\n\nAadhaar   numbers   issued   with   corresponding   demographic\n\nand biometric information. It is a “Protected System”\n\nnotified   under\nSection   70\nof   Information   Technology\n\nAct, 2000. The storage involves end to end encryption,\n\nlogical   partitioning,   fire   walling   and   anonymisation\nof   decrypted   biometric   data.   The   encryption   system\n\nfollows a private key/public model and the private key\n\nis   available   only   with   UIDAI   at   the   processing\n\nlocation.   Hence   even   if   data   packets   are   lost   or\n\nstolen   the   biometric   information   regarding   the   same\n\ncannot   be   accessed.   At   the   CIDR   there   is   multi­layer\n\ntechnological   security   to   afford   protection   from\n\nhacking, and there is also deployment of armed forces\n\nto prevent unauthorised physical access into the CIDR\n\nArea. Additionally entry is electronically controlled.\n\nThere are CIDR at two location already and some other\n\nlocations are likely to be set up to ensure that data\n\nis   not   lost   even   in   the   remote   eventuality   of   a\n\ndisaster. The CIDR is centrally managed.  The   templates\n\nof   finger prints   and   iris   data   are   generated   in   ISO\n\nformat   and   the   same   along   with   demographic   data   and\n\nphoto are stored securely in the authentication server\n\ndatabase. This database is used for authentication in\n\nthe   manner   provided   in   Aadhaar   (Authentication)\n\nRegulation 2016.\n171.     In   view   of   above,   the   apprehension   raised   by\n\nShri   Kapil   Sibal   that   CIDR   is   a   soft   target   is\n\nmisplaced.\n\n172.   To   support   his   submission,   Shri   Shyam   Divan,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance\n\non   judgment   of   the   United   States   Supreme   Court   in\n\nUnited States vs. Antoine Jones, 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012).\n\n173.     A   large   number   of   foreign   judgments   touching\n\nvarious aspects of accumulation of data, retention of\n\ndata, surveillance, has been cited by both the parties\n\nto support their respective stand.  It is necessary to\n\nhave an over view of the opinion expressed by various\n\nCourts   in   other   countries   of   the   world.   The   present\n\nage   being   the   age   of   technology   and   information,   the\n\nissues pertaining to storage and retention of personal\n\ndata in different contexts have come up before several\n\nCourts   of   different   countries   which   also   need   to   be\n\nnoted.\n\n174. The   petitioners   have   relied   on   European   Court,\n\nHuman Rights in  S. and Marper vs. The United Kingdom,\n2008   (48)EHRR     50.  The   applicants,   S   and   Marper   had\n\nsubmitted two applications against the United Kingdom,\n\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland under\nArticle 34\nof\n\nthe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and\n\nFundamental   Freedoms   (the   Convention).   The   applicants\n\ncomplained   that   the   authorities   had   continued   to\n\nretain their fingerprints and cellular samples and DNA\n\nprofiles   after   the   criminal   proceedings   against   them\n\nhad ended with an acquittal or had been discontinued.\n\nThe applicants had applied for judicial review of the\n\npolice   decisions   not   to   destroy   the   fingerprints   and\n\nsamples   which   application   was   rejected.   The   Court   of\n\nappeal   upheld   the   decision   of   the   Administrative\n\nCourt.   The   House   of   Lords   had   also   dismissed   the\n\nappeal on 22nd July, 2004. The House of Lords had taken\n\nthe   view   that   the   mere   retention   of   fingerprints   and\n\nDNA   samples   did   not   constitute   an   interference   with\n\nthe right to respect for private life but stated that,\n\nif   he   were   wrong   in   that   view,     he   regarded   any\n\ninterference as very modest indeed.\n175.   BARONESS   HALE   disagreed   with   the   majority\n\nconsidering that the retention of both fingerprint and\n\nDNA data constituted an interference by the State in a\n\nperson’s   right   to   respect   for   his   private   life   and\n\nthus required justification under the Convention. The\n\napplication   of   the   applicant   was   taken   by   European\n\nCourt   of   Human   Rights   (Strasbourg   Court).   The\n\nStrasbourg Court noticed that majority of the Council\n\nof Europe member States allow the compulsory taking of\n\nfingerprints   and   cellular   samples   in   the   context   of\n\ncriminal   proceedings.   The   United   Kingdom   is   the   only\n\nmember   State   expressly   to   permit   the   systematic   and\n\nindefinite   retention   of   DNA   profiles   and   cellur\n\nsamples   of   persons   who   have   been   acquitted   or   in\n\nrespect   of   whom   criminal   proceedings   have   been\n\ndiscontinued.\n\n176.   Strasbourg Court held that  the mere storing of\n\ndata   relating   to   the   private life   of   an   individual\n\namounts   to   an   interference   within   the   meaning   of\n\nArticle   8.\nIt   was   further   held   that   in   determining\n\nwhether   the   personal   information   retained   by   the\nauthorities   involves   any   of   the   private­life   aspects\n\nmentioned above, the Court will have due regard to the\n\nspecific context in which the information at issue has\n\nbeen recorded and retained.  In paragraph 67 following\n\nhas been laid down:\n\n“67....However,   in   determining   whether\nthe   personal   information   retained   by   the\nauthorities  involves   any   of  the  private­life\naspects mentioned above, the Court will have\ndue   regard   to   the specific   context   in   which\nthe   information   at   issue   has   been   recorded\nand retained, the nature of the records, the\nway   in   which   these   records   are   used   and\nprocessed   and   the   results   that   may   be\nobtained  (see,   mutatis   mutandis,   Friedl,\ncited   above,   49­51,   and   Peck   v.   The   United\nKingdom, cited above, 59).”\n\n177.  Following was laid down in paragraph 73  &  77:\n\n“73. Given   the   nature   and   the   amount   of\npersonal   information   contained   in   cellular\nsamples,   their   retention  per   se  must   be\nregarded   as   interfering   with   the   right   to\nrespect   for   the   private   lives   of   the\nindividuals   concerned.   That   only   a   limited\npart   of   this   information   is   actually\nextracted or used by the authorities through\nDNA profiling and that no immediate detriment\nis   caused   in   a   particular   case   does   not\nchange this conclusion (see Aman cited above,\n\n69).\n\n77. In   view   of   the   foregoing,   the   Court\nconcludes that the retention of both cellular\nsamples and DNA profiles discloses an\ninterference   with   the   applicants’   right   to\nrespect   for   their   private   lives,   within   the\nmeaning of\nArticle 8(1)\nof the Convention.”\n\n178.   The Court also considered the issue of retention\n\nof   fingerprints,   and   held   that   retention   of\n\nfingerprints   may   also   give   rise   to   important   private\n\nlife concerns. The Court also held that the domestic\n\nlaw must afford appropriate safeguards to prevent any\n\nsuch use of personal data as may be inconsistent with\n\nthe   guarantees   of\nArticle   8.\nFollowing   was   held   in\n\nparagraph 103:\n\n“103. The   protection   of   personal   data   is\nof   fundamental   importance   to   a   person’s\nenjoyment of his or her right to respect for\nprivate   and   family   life,   as   guaranteed   by\n\nArticle 8\nof the Convention. The domestic law\nmust afford appropriate safeguards to prevent\nany   such   use   of   personal   data   as   may   be\ninconsistent   with   the   guarantees   of   this\nArticle   (see  mutatis   mutandis,   Z.,   cited\nabove\n,   95).\nThe   need   for   such safeguards   is\nall   the   greater   where   the   protection   of\npersonal data undergoing automatic processing\nis   concerned,   not   least   when   such   data   are\nused   for   police   purposes.   The   domestic   law\nshould   notably   ensure   that   such   data   are\nrelevant and not excessive in relation to the\npurposes   for   which   they   are   stored;   and\npreserved   in   a   form   which   permits\nidentification   of   the   data   subjects   for   no\nlonger   than   is   required   for   the   purpose   for\nwhich those data are stored.”\n\n179.     United   Kingdom   Supreme   Court   had   occasion   to\n\nconsider   the   issue   of   retention   of   data   in  Regina\n\n(Catt)   v.   Association   of   Chief   Police   Officers   of\n\nEngland, Wales and Northern Ireland and another,(2015)\n\n2 WLR 664 – (2015) UKSC 9. The UK Supreme Court in the\n\nabove case also noticed the judgment of Strasbourg in\n\nS. and Marper v. The United Kingdom. The appeal before\n\nUK   Supreme   Court   was   concerned   with   the   systematic\n\ncollection   retention   by   police   authorities   of\n\nelectronic   data   about   individuals   and   whether   it   is\n\ncontrary to\nArticle 8\nof the European Convention. The\n\nappellant   before   the   Court   had   accepted   that   it   was\n\nlawful for the police to make a record of the events\n\nin   question   as   they   occurred,   but   contends   that   the\n\npolice interfered with their rights under\nArticle 8\nof\n\nthe Convention by thereafter retaining the information\n\non   a   searchable   database.   After   noticing   the\n\njurisprudence   of   the   European   Court   of   Human   Rights\n\nLord  Sumption stated following in paragraph 33:\n“33. Although   the   jurisprudence   of   the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights is exacting in\ntreating   the   systematic   storage   of   personal\ndata   as   engaging\narticle   8\nand   requiring\njustification, it has consistently recognised\nthat   (subject   always   to   proportionality)\npublic   safety   and   the   prevention   and\ndetection   of   crime   will   justify   it   provided\nthat   sufficient   safeguards   exist   to   ensure\nthat personal information is not retained for\nlonger   than   is   required   for   the   purpose   of\nmaintaining   public   order   and   preventing   or\ndetecting crime, and that disclosure to third\nparties   is   properly   restricted:   see\nBouchacourt v France, given 17 December 2009,\nparas   68­69,   and   Brunet   v.   France\n(Application   No.21010/10)   (unreported)   given\n18   September   2014,   para   36.   In   my   opinion,\nboth   of   these   requirements   are   satisfied   in\nthis case. Like any complex system dependent\non   administrative   supervision,   the   present\nsystem   is not   proof   against   mistakes.   At\nleast   in   hindsight,   it   is   implicit   in   the\n2012   report   of   HMIC   and   the   scale   on   which\nthe database was weeded out over the next two\nyears that the police may have been retaining\nmore   records   than   the   Code   of   Practice   and\nthe MOPI guidelines really required. But the\njudicial   and   administrative   procedures   for\naddressing   this   are   effective,   as   the   facts\ndisclosed on this appeal suggest.”\n\n180.    The preponderance of authorities on the subject\n\nof   retention   of   data   is   that   retention   of   personal\n\ndata   effecting   personal   life   of   an   individual   may\n\ninterfere   in   his   right   of   privacy   and   the   State   can\n\njustify   its   retention   subject   to   proportionality   and\nsubject   to   there   being   sufficient   safeguards   to\n\npersonal   information   is   not   retained   for   longer   than\n\nit required.\n\n181.   Reverting   back   to   the   Aadhaar   Act,   it   is   clear\n\nthat   requesting   entity   as   well   as   authority   are\n\nrequired   to   retain   authentication   data   for   a\n\nparticular   period   and   thereafter   it   will   be   archived\n\nfor   five   years   and   thereafter   authentication   data\n\ntransaction shall be deleted except such data which is\n\nrequired by the Court in connection with any pending\n\ndispute.     We   had   already   noticed   that   data   which   is\n\nretained   by   the   entity   and   authority   for   certain\n\nperiod   is   minimal   information   pertaining   to   identity\n\nauthentication   only   no   other   personal   data   is\n\nretained.   Thus,   provisions   of   Aadhaar   Act   and\n\nRegulations made thereunder fulfill three fold test as\n\nlaid   down   in\nPuttaswamy\ncase   (supra),  hence,   we\n\nconclude that storage and retention of data does not\n\nviolate fundamental right of privacy.\n182.  Now, we come to issue of surveillance, which has\n\nbeen very strongly raised by petitioners.   Shri Shyam\n\nDivan, learned counsel for the petitioners has relied\n\non judgment of U.S. Supreme Court in United States Vs.\n\nAntoine Jones, 132 S.Ct. 945 (2012).   Antoine Jones,\n\nowner and operator of a nightclub was under suspicion\n\nof   trafficking   in   narcotics.    A   warrant   was   issued\n\nauthorising   installation   of   an   electronic   tracking\n\ndevice   on   the   jeep   registered   in   the   name   of   John's\n\nwife.   Agents installed a GPS tracking device in the\n\njeep when it was parked in a public parking.   On the\n\nbasis of data obtained from the device, the Government\n\ncharged Jones for several offences.   In trial, Jones\n\nfound a locational data obtained form the GPS device.\n\nA verdict of guilt was returned, which on appeal was\n\nreversed   by   United   States,   Appeal   for   District\n\nColumbia.\n\n183.     Matter   was   taken   to   the   U.S.   Supreme   Court.\n\nFourth Amendment provides  “the right of the people to\n\nbe   secured   in   their   persons,   houses,   papers,   and\n\neffects,   against   unreasonable   searches   and   seizures,\nshall not be violated.” Justice Scalia, delivering the\n\nopinion of the Court affirmed the judgment of Court of\n\nAppeal.  Justice Sotomayor concurring wrote:­\n\n“I join the Court's opinion because I agree\nthat   a   search   within   the   meaning   of   the\nFourth   Amendment   occurs,   at   a   minimum,\n“[w]here,   as   here,   the   Government   obtains\ninformation   by   physically   intruding   on   a\nconstitutionally   protected   area.”   Ante,   at\n950,   n.   3.   In   this   case,   the   Government\ninstalled a Global Positioning System (GPS)\ntracking device on respondent Antoine Jones'\nJeep   without   a   valid   warrant   and   without\nJones'   consent,   then   used   that   device   to\nmonitor the Jeep's movements over the course\nof four weeks. The Government usurped Jones'\nproperty   for   the   purpose   of   conducting\nsurveillance   on   him,   thereby   invading\nprivacy   interests   long   afforded,   and\nundoubtedly   entitled   to,   Fourth   Amendment\nprotection.   See,   e.g.,   Silverman   v.   United\nStates, 365 U. S. 505, 511­512 S1 S.Ct. 679,\n5 L.Ed.2d 734 (1961). ”\n\n184.  The above case was a case where tracking device,\n\ni.e.,   GPS   was   installed   in   the   vehicle   with   purpose\n\nand   motive   of   surveillance   and   obtaining   data   to   be\n\nused   against   Jones.     Present   is   not   a   case   where   it\n\ncan be said that Aadhaar infrastructure is designed in\n\na   manner   as   to   put   a   surveillance   on   Aadhaar   number\n\nholder (ANH).\n185.   Another judgment which is relied  by Shri  Shyam\n\nDivan is judgment of European Court of Human Rights in\n\nStrasbourg Court in  Roman Zakharov Vs. Russia  decided\n\non   04.12.2015.     In   the   above   case,   the   applicant\n\nalleged   that   the   system   of   secret   interception   of\n\nmobile telephone communications in Russia violated his\n\nright   to   respect   for   his   private   life   and\n\ncorrespondence and that he did not have any effective\n\nremedy in that respect.   In Para 148 of the judgment,\n\nthe case  of the applicant was noted in the  following\n\nwords:­\n\n“148.     The   applicant   complained   that   the\nsystem   of   covert   interception   of   mobile\ntelephone   communications   in   Russia   did   not\ncomply with the requirements of\nArticle 8\nof\nthe Convention, which reads as follows:­\n\n“1.     Everyone   has   the   right   to\nrespect   for   his   private   and   family\nlife,   his   home   and   his\ncorrespondence.\n\n2.  There shall be no interference by\na public authority with the exercise\nof   this   right   except   such   as   is   in\naccordance   with   the   law   and   is\nnecessary in a democratic society in\nthe   interests   of   national   security,\npublic   safety   or   the   economic   well­\nbeing   of   the   country,   for   the\nprevention of disorder or crime, for\nthe   protection   of   health   or   morals,\nor   for   the   protection   of   the   rights\nand freedoms of others.”\n\n186.  The Court came to the following conclusion:­\n\n\"175.     The   Court   notes   that   the   contested\nlegislation   institutes   a   system   of   secret\nsurveillance   under   which   any   person   using\nmobile telephone services of Russia providers\ncan   have   his   or   her   mobile   telephone\ncommunications intercepted, without ever being\nnotified of the surveillance.  To that extent,\nthe   legislation   in   question   directly   affects\nall users of these mobile telephone services.”\n\n187.     The   Strasbourg   Court   held   that   there   had   been\n\nviolation of\nArticle 8\nof the Convention.   The  above\n\ncase   also   does   not   help   the   petitioners   in   reference\n\nto Aadhaar structure.   Above case was a clear case of\n\nsurveillance   by   interception   of   mobile\n\ntelecommunication.\n\n188.   Another judgment relied by  Shri Shyam Divan is\n\nDigital   Rights   Ireland   Ltd.   Vs.   Minister   for\n\nCommunications,   Marine   and   Natural   Resources  decided\n\non 08.04.2014.  Para 1 of the judgment notice:­\n\n\"These   requests   for   a   preliminary   ruling\nconcern  the  validity   of  Directive   2006/24/EC\nof the European Parliament and of the Council\nof   15   March   2006   on   the   retention   of   data\ngenerated or processed in connection with the\nprovision   of   publicly   available   electronic\ncommunications   services   or   of   public\ncommunications   networks   and   amending\nDirective 2002/58/EC(OJ 2006 L 105, p. 54).”\n\n189.     Directive   2006/24   laid   down   the   obligation   on\n\nthe  providers   of   publicly   available   electronic\n\ncommunications   services   or   of   public   communications\n\nnetworks to retain certain data which are generated or\n\nprocessed   by   them.     Noticing   various   articles   of   the\n\nDirectives, the Court in Paragraph 27 noted:­\n\n“27. Those data, taken as a whole, may allow\nvery   precise   conclusions   to   be   drawn\nconcerning   the   private   lives   of   the

carried   out,   the\nsocial relationships of those persons and the\nsocial environments frequented by them.”\n\n190.     The   directives   were   held   to   be   violating   the\n\nprinciples   of   proportionality.     The   above   case   was\n\nalso   a   case   of   retaining   data   pertaining   to\n\ncommunications by service providers.  The retention of\n\ncommunication   data   is   a   clear   case   of   intrusion   in\n\nprivacy.   The above is also a case which in no manner\nhelp the petitioners when contrasted with the Aadhaar\n\narchitecture.\n\n191.   At   this   juncture,   we   may   also   notice   one\n\nsubmission raised by the petitioners that Aadhaar Act\n\ncould have devised a less intrusive measure/means.  It\n\nwas   suggested   that   for   identity   purpose,   the\n\nGovernment   could   have   devised   issuance   of   a   smart\n\ncard, which may have contained a biometric information\n\nand retain it in the card itself, which would not have\n\nbegged   the   question   of   sharing   or   transfer   of   the\n\ndata.     We   have   to   examine   the   Aadhaar   Act   as   it\n\nexists. It is not the Court's arena to enter into the\n\nissue as to debate on any alternative mechanism, which\n\naccording   to   the   petitioners   would   have   been   better.\n\nFraming a legislative policy and providing a mechanism\n\nfor   implementing   the   legislative   policy   is   the\n\nlegislative domain in which Court seldom trench.\n\n192.  We may refer to a judgment of U.K. Supreme Court\n\nAB   Vs.   Her   Majesty's   Advocate,   [2017]   UKSC   25,   where\n\nU.K.   Supreme   Court   has   not   approved   the   arguments\nbased   on   less   intrusive   means.    Court   held   that\n\nwhether   the   Parliament   would   have   used   a   less\n\nintrusive   means   does   not   involve   the   Court   in\n\nidentifying   an   alternative   measure,   which   is   least\n\nintrusive.  In Para 37, following has been laid down:­\n\n“37.  I  am   not  persuaded.  It   is  important  to\nrecall   that   the   question   of   whether   the\nParliament   could   have   used   a   less   intrusive\nmeasure   does   not   involve   the   court   in\nidentifying  the  alternative  measure  which   is\nleast   intrusive.   The   court   allows   the\nlegislature   a   margin   of   discretion   and   asks\nwhether the limitation on the\narticle 8\nright\nis   one   which   it   was   reasonable   for   the\nParliament   to   propose:   Bank   Mellat   v   HM\nTreasury   (No   2)   [2013]   UKSC   38,   [2014]   AC\n700, para 75 per Lord Reed; Animal Defenders\nInternational v United Kingdom (2013) 57 EHRR\n21, para 110. Had the 2009 Act provided that\nthe   reasonable   belief   defence   would   not   be\navailable   if   on   an   earlier   occasion   the\naccused   had   been   charged   with   an   offence\nwhich   itself   objectively   entailed   a   warning\nof   the   illegality   of   consensual   sexual\nactivity   with   older   children,   the   fact   that\nthere   were   other   options,   which   were   less\nintrusive,   to   restrict   the   availability   of\nthat defence would not cause an infringement\nof   the   individual's\narticle   8\nright.   The\nproblem for the Lord Advocate in this appeal\nis where to find such a warning. ”\n\n193.     We   may   profitably   note   the   judgment   of   Privy\n\nCouncil   arising   from   a   decision   of   Supreme   Court   of\nMauritius   –  Madhewoo   Vs.   State   of   Mauritius.       The\n\ncase   relates   to   a   national   identity   card,   which   was\n\nbrought   in   effect   by   an   Act   namely,   the   National\n\nIdentity   Card   Act,   1985   providing   for   adult   citizens\n\nof   Mauritius   to   carry   identity   cards.\nThe   Act\nwas\n\namended   in   2013   by   which   Government   introduced   a   new\n\nsmart   identity   card,   which   incorporates   on   a   chip   on\n\nthe   citizen's   fingerprints   and   other   biometric\n\ninformation   relating   to   his/her   characteristics.     A\n\ncitizen of the Republic of Mauritius did not apply for\n\nNational Identity Card and he challenged the validity\n\nof the 2013 Act.   The Supreme Court of Mauritius held\n\nthat   the   provisions   of   1985   Act,   which   enforce   the\n\ncompulsory   taking   and   recording   of   fingerprints   of   a\n\ncitizen disclosed an interference with the appellant’s\n\nrights   guaranteed   under\nSection   9(1)\nof   the\n\nConstitution.   The\nSection 9(1)\nprovided “except with\n\nhis   own   consent,   no   person   shall   be   subject   to   the\n\nsearch   of   his   person   or   his   private   or   the   entry   by\n\nothers   in   his   premises.”     Supreme   Court   had   rejected\n\nthe   challenge   to   the   other   provisions   of   the\nConstitution.   Matter was taken to the Privy Council.\n\nThe   challenge   made   before   the   Privy   Council   was\n\nnoticed   in   Para   7   of   the   judgment,   which   is   to   the\n\nfollowing effect:­\n\n“7.   In   this   appeal   the   appellant   challenges\nthe   constitutionality   of   (a)   the   obligation\nto   provide   fingerprints   and   other   biometric\ninformation under\nsection 4\n, (b) the storage\nof   that   material   on   the   identity   card   under\n\nsection   5\n,   (c)   the   compulsory   production   of\nan identity card to a policeman under\nsection\n7(1A)\nin response to a request under\nsection\n7(1)(b)\n, and (d) the gravity of the potential\npenalties   under\nsection   9(3)\nfor   non­\ncompliance.   He   claims,   first,   that   the\nimplementation   of   the   new   biometric  identity\ncard is in breach of\nsections 1\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nof the   Constitution\ncoupled   with\narticle   22\nof   the   Civil   Code\n(which   provides   that   everyone   has   the   right\nto respect for his private life and empowers\ncourts with competent jurisdiction to prevent\nor end a violation of privacy) and, secondly,\nthat the collection and permanent storage of\npersonal   biometric   data,   including\nfingerprints,   on   the   identity   card   are   in\nbreach of those sections of the Constitution\nand that article of the Civil Code. ”\n\n194.     The   Privy   Council   agreed   with   the   decision   of\n\nthe   Supreme   Court   that   compulsory   taking   of\n\nfingerprints   and   the   extraction   of   minutiae   involved\n\nan interference with the appellant’s\nSection 9\nrights\nwhich   required   to   be   justified   under\nSection   9(2)\n.\n\nThe challenge raised before the Privy Council has been\n\nnoticed   in   Para   25,   which   challenges   were   repelled.\n\nParas 25 and 26 are as follows:­\n\n“25.   The   appellant   challenges   the   Supreme\nCourt’s   evaluation   because,   he   submits,   the\ncreation   of   a   reliable   identity   card   system\ndoes   not   justify   the   interference   with   his\nfundamental   rights.   He   submits   that   the\nobligation   to   provide   his   fingerprints\ninterferes   with   his   right   to   be   presumed\ninnocent   and   also   that   an   innocuous   failure\nto   comply   with\nsection   4(2)(c)\ncould   give\nrise   to   draconian   penalties   under\nsection\n9(3)\nof   the   Act   (para   6   above).   He   also\npoints   out   that   in   India   a   proposal   for   a\nbiometric   identity   card   was   held   to   be\nunconstitutional, and, in the United Kingdom,\nlibertarian   political   opposition   resulted   in\nthe   repeal   of   legislation   to   introduce\nbiometric   identity   cards.   The   interference,\nhe submits, is disproportionate.\n\n26. In the Board’s view, these challenges do\nnot undermine the Supreme Court’s assessment.\nFirst,   the   requirement   to   provide\nfingerprints   for   an   identity   card   does   not\ngive rise to any inference of criminality as\nit   is   a   requirement   imposed   on   all   adult\ncitizens.   It   is   true   that,   if   circumstances\narose in which a police officer was empowered\nto   require   the   appellant   to   produce   his\nidentity   card   and   the   government   had   issued\ncard   readers,   the   authorities   would   have\naccess to his fingerprint minutiae which they\ncould use for the purposes of identification\nin   a   criminal   investigation.   But   that   does\nnot   alter   the   presumption   of   innocence.\nSecondly,   the   penalties   in\nsection   9(3)\nare\nmaxima   for   offences,   including   those   in\n\nsection   9(1)\n,   which   cover   serious   offences\nsuch   as   forgery   and   fraudulent   behaviour   in\nrelation   to   identity   cards.   The   subsection\ndoes   not   mandate   the   imposition   of   the\nmaximum  sentence   for   any   behaviour.  Thirdly,\nwhile   judicial   rulings   on   international\ninstruments   and   the   constitutions   of   other\ncountries   can   often   provide   assistance   to   a\ncourt   in   interpreting   the   provisions\nprotecting fundamental rights and freedoms in\nits   own   constitution,   the   degree   of   such\nassistance will depend on the extent to which\nthe documents are similarly worded. ”\n\n195.   As   noticed   above,   learned   counsel   for   the\n\npetitioners   has   raised   various   issues   pertaining   to\n\nsecurity   and   safety   of   data   and   CIDR.     Apprehensions\n\nraised by the petitioners does not furnish  any  ground\n\nto struck down the enactment or a legislative policy.\n\nThis   Court   in\nG.   Sundarrajan   Vs.   Union   of   India   and\n\nOthers\n.   (2013)   6   SCC     620,   had   occasion   to   consider\n\nIndia's   National   Policy   and   challenge   to   a   Nuclear\n\nProject,   which   was   launched   by   the   Government\n\nupholding the legislative policy, the Court laid down\n\nfollowing in Paras 15 and 15.1:­\n\n“15. India's National Policy has been clearly\nand   unequivocally   expressed   by   the\nlegislature   in   the\nAtomic   Energy   Act\n.\nNational   and   International   policy   of   the\ncountry   is   to   develop   control   and   use   of\natomic   energy   for   the   welfare   of   the   people\nand for other peaceful purposes. NPP has been\nset up at Kudankulam as part of the national\npolicy which is discernible from the Preamble\nof   the   Act   and   the   provisions   contained\ntherein.   It   is   not   for   Courts   to   determine\nwhether   a   particular   policy   or   a   particular\ndecision taken in fulfillment of a policy, is\nfair.   Reason   is   obvious,   it   is   not   the\nprovince   of   a   court   to   scan   the   wisdom   or\nreasonableness   of   the   policy   behind   the\nStatute.\n\n15.1.  Lord MacNaughten in Vacher & Sons Ltd.\n\nv.   London   Society   of   Compositors   (1913)   AC\n107  HL has stated:\n\n“......Some   people   may   think   the\npolicy   of   the   Act   unwise   and   even\ndangerous to the community......But a\nJudicial   tribunal   has   nothing   to   do\nwith the policy of any Act which it\nmay be called upon to interpret. That\nmay be a matter for private judgment.\n\nThe duty of the Court, and its only\nduty,   is   to   expound   the   language   of\nthe   Act   in   accordance   with   the\nsettled rules of construction.”\n\n196.     This   Court   also   held   that   a   project   cannot   be\n\nstopped merely on the ground of apprehension.   In the\n\npresent   case,   also   lot   of   apprehensions   of\n\npossibilities   of   insecurity   of   data   has   been   raised.\n\nIn   India,   there   is   no   specific   data   protection   laws\nlike   law   in   place   in   United   Kingdom.\nIn   Privacy\n\njudgment –\nPuttaswamy\n(supra), this Court has noticed\n\nthat  Shri Krishna Commission  is already examining the\n\nissue regarding data protection and as has been stated\n\nby   learned   Attorney   General   before   us,   after   the\n\nreport   is   received,   the   Government   will   proceed   with\n\ntaking   steps   for   bringing   a   specific   law   on   data\n\nprotection.     We   need   not   say   anything   more   on   the\n\nabove   subject.     After   we   have   reserved   the   judgment,\n\nSrikrishna   Commission   has   submitted   its   report\n\ncontaining a draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018\n\nin   July   2018.   The   report   having   been   submitted,   we\n\nhope   that   law   pertaining   to   Personal   Data   Protection\n\nshall   be   in   place   very   soon   taking   care   of   several\n\napprehensions expressed by petitioners.\n\n197.     The   Aadhaar   architecture   is   to   be   examined   in\n\nlight   of   the   statutory   regime   as   in   place.     We   have\n\nnoticed   the   regulations   framed   under   Aadhaar   Act,\n\nwhich   clearly   indicate   that   regulations   brings   in\n\nplace   statutory   provisions   for   data   protection,\n\nrestriction   on   data   sharing   and   other   aspects   of   the\nmatter.   Several provisions of penalty on data breach\n\nand   violation   of   the   provisions   of   the   Act   and\n\nregulations have been provided.\n\n198.  We have no reason to doubt that the project will\n\nbe   implemented   in   accordance   with   the   Act   and   the\n\nRegulations   and   there   is   no   reason   to   imagine   that\n\nthere will be statutory breaches, which may affect the\n\ndata   security,   data   protection   etc.\nIn   view   of\n\nforegoing   discussions,   we   are   of   the   considered\n\nopinion   that   Statutory   regime   as   delineated   by   the\n\nAadhaar   Act   and   the   Regulations   fulfills   the   three­\n\nfold test as\nlaid down  in\n\nPuttaswamy\n(supra)  and the\n\nlaw,   i.e.   Aadhaar   Act   gives   ample   justification   for\n\nlegitimate   aim   of   the   Government   and   the   law   being\n\nproportional to the object envisaged. The petitioners\n\nduring   their   submissions   have   also   attacked   various\n\nprovisions   of   Enrolment   and   Update   Regulations,\n\nAuthentication   Regulations,   Data   Security   Regulations\n\nand Sharing of Information Regulations. All the above\n\nregulations   have   been   framed   in   exercise   of   power\n\nunder\nSection 54\nof the Act on the matters covered by\nthe   Act.\n\nWe   having   held   that   by   collection   of   data,\n\nits   retention,   storage,   use   and   sharing,   no   Privacy\n\nRight   is   breached,   we   are   of   the   view   that   related\n\nregulations   also   pass   the   muster   of   three­fold   tests\n\nas\nlaid   down   in\n\nK.Puttaswamy\ncase.   The   provisions   of\n\nAct   in   the   above   regard   having   passed   the   muster   of\n\nthree­fold tests, the related regulations also cannot\n\nbe held to breach Right of Privacy. Thus, challenge to\n\nregulations   relating   to   collection,   storage,   use,\n\nretention and sharing fails and it is held that they\n\ndo   not   violate   Constitutional   Rights   of   Privacy.     In\n\nresult,   we   answer   the   Issue   Nos.   3,   4   and   5   in\n\nfollowing manner:­\n\nAns. 3, 4, 5:­\n\n(i)   Collection   of   data,   its   storage   and   use\n\ndoes   not   violate   fundamental   Right   of\n\nPrivacy.\n\n(ii)   Aadhaar Act does not create an architecture\n\nfor pervasive surveillance.\n\n(iii) Aadhaar   Act   and   Regulations   provides\n\nprotection and safety of the data received\nfrom individuals.\n\nWhether   Section   7   OF   Aadhaar   Act   is\nIssue Nos. unconstitutional?\n\n6 and 7\nWhether   right   to   food,   shelter   etc.\nenvisaged   under\nArticle   21\nshall   take\nprecedence on the right to privacy  of the\nbeneficiaries?\n\n199.     Shri   Pandit   Jawahar   Lal   Nehru   while   concluding\n\ndebate on “Aims and Objects Resolution” on 22.01.1947\n\nin the Constituent Assembly  of India stated:\n\n“The   first   task   of   this   Assembly   is   to\nfree India through a new constitution to feed\nthe   starving   people   and   cloth   the   naked\nmasses   and   to   give   every   Indian   fullest\nopportunity   to   develop   himself   according   to\nhis   capacity.   This   is   certainly   a   great\ntask.”\n\n200. After attaining the freedom the country proceeded\n\nto realise the dream and vision which founding fathers\n\nof   our   democratic   system   envisaged.   The   Constitution\n\nof   India   apart   from   enumerating   various   Fundamental\n\nRights   including   right   to   life   has   provided   for\n\nDirective Principles of State Policy under Chapter IV\n\nof   the   Constitution   which   was   to   find   objectives   in\ngoverness   of   the   country.\nArticle   38\nprovided   that\n\nState   shall   strive   to   promote   the   welfare   of   the\n\npeople by securing and protecting as effectively as it\n\nmay a social order in which justice, social, economic\n\nand   political,   shall   inform   all   the   institutions   of\n\nthe national life. It further provided that the State\n\nshall,   in   particular,   strive   to   minimise   the\n\ninequalities   in   income,   and   endeavour   to   eliminate\n\ninequalities   in   status,   facilities   and   opportunities,\n\nnot   only   amongst   individuals   but   also   amongst   groups\n\nof   people   residing   in   different   areas   or   engaged   in\n\ndifferent vocations.\n\n201. After enforcement of the Constitution almost all\n\nthe   Governments   worked   towards   the   object   of\n\nelimination   of   poverty   and   to   empower   marginal/poor\n\nsection   of   the   society.   The   endeavour   of   the\n\nGovernment   was   always   to   frame   policies   keeping   in\n\nview the “little Indian” who is in the centre of all\n\npolicies and governance.\n\n202.   Section   7   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   is   the   most\n\nimportant   provision   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   around   which\nentire   architecture   of   Aadhaar   Act   has   been   built.\n\nSection 7\nis to the following effect:\n\n“7.   The   Central   Government   or,   as   the   case\nmay   be,   the   State   Government   may,   for   the\npurpose   of   establishing   identity   of   an\nindividual   as   a   condition   for   receipt   of   a\nsubsidy,   benefit   or   service   for   which   the\nexpenditure is incurred from, or the receipt\ntherefrom   forms   part   of,   the   Consolidated\nFund   of   India,   require   that   such   individual\nundergo   authentication,   or   furnish   proof   of\npossession   of   Aadhaar   number   or   in   the   case\nof   an   individual   to   whom   no   Aadhaar   number\nhas   been   assigned,   such   individual   makes   an\napplication   for   enrolment:   Provided   that   if\nan   Aadhaar   number   is   not   assigned   to   an\nindividual,   the   individual   shall   be   offered\nalternate   and   viable   means   of   identification\nfor   delivery   of   the   subsidy,   benefit   or\nservice.”\n\n203.     The   objects   and   reasons   of   the   Act   as   noticed\n\nabove   as   well   as   the   Preamble   of   the   Act   focus   on\n\ntargeted   delivery   of   financial   and   other   subsidies,\n\nbenefits   and   services   which   are   envisaged   in   Section\n\n7. The petitioners challenge the constitutionality of\n\nSection 7\n. They submit that\nSection 7\nseeks to render\n\nthe   constitutional   and   statutory   obligations   of   the\n\nState   to   provide   benefits,   subsidies   and   services,\n\nconditional upon an individual parting with his or her\nbiometric and demographic information. An individual’s\n\nrights and entitlements cannot be made dependent upon\n\nan invasion of his or her bodily integrity and his or\n\nher   private   information   which   the   individual   may   not\n\nbe   willing   to   share   with   the   State.   The   bargain\n\nunderlying\nSection   7\nis   an   unconscionable,\n\nunconstitutional   bargain.   An   individual   has\n\nconstitutional   right   to   receive   benefits,   subsidies\n\nand   services   which   is   fundamental   right   and   it   is\n\nState’s obligation to provide for fulfillment of that\n\nfundamental   right.   He   submitted   that   there   is   no\n\nrationale in enactment of\nSection 7\nneither there was\n\nany   legitimate   state   interest   nor   the   provision   is\n\nproportionate.   The   petitioners   submit   that   provision\n\nof requiring every person to undergo authentication to\n\navail   benefits/services/   entitlements,   falls   foul   of\n\nArticle   14.\nSince,   firstly   such   mandatory\n\nauthentication   has   caused,   and   continues   to   cause,\n\nexclusion of the most marginalised section of society;\n\nand   secondly   this   exclusion   is   not   simply   a   question\n\nof   poor   implementation   that   can   be   administratively\nresolved, but stems from  the very design of the Act.\n\nLearned   counsel   for   the   petitioners   have   referred   to\n\nand   relied   on   several   materials   in   support   of   their\n\nsubmissions   that   working   of\nSection   7\nhas   caused\n\nexclusion.   Since   a   large   number   of   persons   who   are\n\nentitled   to   receive   benefits,   subsidies   and   services\n\nare   unable   to   get   it   due   to   not   being   able   to\n\nauthenticate   due   to   various   reasons   like   old   age,\n\nchange of biometric and other reasons. The petitioners\n\nhave   referred   to   affidavits   filed   by   several\n\nindividuals   and   NGOs   who   after   field   verification\n\nbrought   materials   before   this   Court   to   support   their\n\nsubmission   regarding   large   scale   exclusion.  It   is\n\nfurther   contended   that   State’s   contention   that\n\nCircular   dated   24.10.2017   has   resolved   implementation\n\nissued   cannot   be   accepted.   The   authentication   system\n\nin   the   Aadhaar   Act   is   probabilistic.   Biometric\n\ntechnology does not guarantee 100% accuracy and it is\n\nfallible,   refers   UIDAI’s   own   Report   on   “Role   of\n\nBiometric Technology in Aadhaar Entrolment” (2012) has\n\nbeen made where Report stated that biometric accuracy\nafter   accounting   for     the   biometric   failure   to   enrol\n\nrate,   false   positive   identification   rate,   and   false\n\nnegative   identification   rate,   was   99.768%   accuracy.\n\nFor   a   population   over   119.22   crore   enrolled   in\n\nAadhaar, it is  a  shocking admission of  the fact that\n\nthere   are   27.65   lakh   people   who   are   excluded   from\n\nbenefits   linked   to   Aadhaar.   It   is   contended   that\n\nvalidity of an act is to be judged not by its object\n\nor   form,   but   by   its   effect   on   fundamental   rights.\n\nMandatory authentication at the point of use violates\n\nArticle   21.\nIt   is   contended   that   the   Government   has\n\nfailed to discharge its burden of proof under Article\n\n21. The State has also failed to satisfy the test of\n\nproportionality   which   makes\nSection   7\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n204.  The petitioners further submit that the claim of\n\nthe   Government   that   by   Aadhaar   authentication   the\n\nState   has   been   able   to   save   11   billion   per   annum   is\n\nincorrect     and   without   any   basis.   It   is   further\n\nsubmitted   that   massive   savings   under  Mahatma   Gandhi\n\nNational   Rural   Employment   Guarantee   Scheme   under\nFinancial Benefits Accrued on account for DBT/Aadhaar\n\nsince 2014 claims of substantial savings upto 2015­16\n\nthe   amount   of   reported   savings   is   shown   as   Rs.3000\n\ncrores   and   upto   2016­17   it   is   shown   as   Rs.11,741\n\ncrores. Referring to the claim of the Government that\n\nhe  submitted  facts  of job cards could be  only 67,637\n\nwere   found   to   be   job   cards   linked   to   more   than   one\n\nAadhaar   number.   Thus,   maximum   saving   for   this   period\n\nwould be 127.88 crores compared to the inflated figure\n\nof   Rs.3000   crores.     The   Financial   Benefits   claimed\n\nunder   PAHAL   scheme   was   Rs.14,672   crores   which   is   not\n\ncorrect. Referring to Comptroller and Auditor General\n\nReport, it is pointed out that with respect to  2014­\n\n15, the real outcome  of savings is  only 1.33 crores.\n\nHe   submits   that   major   saving   was   on   account   of\n\ndecrease in off­take of domestic subsidised cylinders\n\nof   consumer   and   decrease   in   fuel   prices.   On   Public\n\nDistribution System referring to answer to a question\n\nin   Lok   Sabha   on   26.07.2016   it   is   submitted   that   the\n\nMinister   of   Consumer   Affairs,   Food   and   Public\nDistribution   has   stated   only   that   approximately   2.33\n\ncrores ration cards were deleted during 2013­2016.\n\n205. Learned Attorney General has referred to material\n\non   record   to   justify   the   legitimate   state   aim   which\n\nled   to   enactment   of\nSection   7\n.   Learned   Attorney\n\nGeneral   refers   to   Report   No.3   of   2000   of   the\n\nComptroller   and   Auditor   General   of   India   which   has\n\nbeen brought  on record as Annexure R­I  to the common\n\nadditional   affidavit   on   behalf   of   respondents.   He\n\nsubmits   that   the   Comptroller   and   Auditor   General   in\n\nhis   Report   states   that   1.93   crore   bogus   ration   cards\n\nwere found to be  in circulation in  13 States. Report\n\nfurther   states   that   a   signification   portion   of   the\n\nsubsidised food­grains and other essential commodities\n\ndid   not   reach   the   beneficiaries   due   to   their\n\ndiversion   in   the   open   market.   The   Performance   Report\n\nof   the   Planning   Commission   of   India   titled\n\n“Performance   Evaluation   Report   of   Targeted   Public\n\nDistribution   System   (TPDS)”   dated   March,   2005   which\n\nhas   been   brought   on   record   as   Annexure­R­6     to   the\ncommon   additional   affidavit   on   behalf   of   respondents\n\nnotes following:\n\ni. State­wise figure of excess Ration Cards\nin  various states and the existence of\nover 1.52  crore  excess  Ration Cards\nissued [Page 362 of  CAA]\n\nii. Exercise   of   fictitious   households   and\nidentification     errors     leading     to\nexclusion     of genuine beneficiaries.\n\niii. Leakage   through   ghost   BPL   Ration   Cards\nfound to  be prevalent in almost all the\nstates under  study.[Pg. 369 of CAA)\n\niv.  The Leakage of food grains through ghost\ncards  has   been   tabulated   and   the\npercentage of such  leakage on an All\nIndia basis has been estimated  at\n16.67% [Pg.370 of CAA].\n\nv. It is concluded that a large part of the\nsubsidised food grains were not reaching\nthe  target group.\n\n206.     Similar   reports   regarding   few   subsidies   have\n\nbeen referred and relied.\n\n207.   Learned Attorney General has also relied on the\nreport   submitted   by   V.V.   Giri   National   Labour\n\nInstitute   and   sponsored   by   the   Department   of   Rural\n\nDevelopment, Ministry of Rural Development, Government\n\nof   India   which   examined   various   aspects   of   National\n\nRural   Employment   Guarantee   Scheme   while   studying   the\n\nschedule   of   rates   for   National   Rural   Employment\n\nGuarantee Scheme. In paragraph 12.8 (Annesure R­4) to\n\nthe   common   additional   affidavit   on   behalf   of\n\nrespondents following has been stated:\n\n2. “There   was   great   fraud   in   making   fake\ncards,   muster   rolls   were   not   maintained\nproperly, and work was not provided to job\nseekers   sometimes.   In   many   cases,   it   was\nfound   that   workers   performed   one   day’s\njob,   but   their   attendance   was   put   for   33\ndays.   The   workers   got   money   for   one   day\nwhile   wages   for   32   days   were\nmisappropriated   by   the   people   associated\nwith the functioning of NREGS.”\n\n208.     Another   report   dated   09.11.2012   of   National\n\nInstitute   of   Public   Finance   and   Policy’s     “A   Cost­\n\nbenefit analysis of Aadhaar” estimated that a leakage\n\nof   approximately   12   percent   is   being   caused   to   the\n\nGovernment on account of ghost workers and manipulated\n\nmuster rolls. Thirteenth Finance Commission Report for\n2010­2015 dated December, 2000 in Chapter 12 states:\n\n“creation   of   a   biometric­based   unique\nidentity for all residents in the country has\nthe   potential   to   address   need   of   the\ngovernment   to   ensure   that   only   eligible\npersons   are   provided   subsidies   and   benefits\nand that all eligible persons are covered.”\n\n209.   Various   other   reports   have   been   referred   to   and\n\nrelied by Learned Attorney General to substantiate his\n\ncase   that   there   was   large   leakage   and   pilferation   of\n\nsubsidies which were allocated by the Government under\n\ndifferent schemes.\n\n210.   This   Court   had occasion   to   consider   public\n\ndistribution system in PUCL vs. Union of India, (2011)\n\n14   SCC   331,    the   Court   noticed   the   report   of   High\n\nPowered   Committee   headed   by   Justice   D.P.   Wadhwa,\n\nretired   Judge   of   this   Court   who   had   submitted   report\n\non the Public Distribution System. One of the actions\n\nsuggested by the Committee was noticed in paragraphs 2\n\nand 12 , Component II:\n\n“2. In order to implement this system across\nthe   country,   the   following   actions   are\nsuggested by the Committee:\n\n… … …\nComponent   II:   Electronic   authentication\nof   delivery   and   payments   at   the   fair   price\nshop   level.   In   order   to   ensure   that   each\ncard­holder   is   getting   his   due   entitlement,\ncomputerisation  has  to   reach   literally   every\ndoorstep and this could take long. Moreover,\nseveral   States   have   already   started\nimplementing   smart   cards,   food   coupons,  etc.\nwhich   have   not   been   entirely   successful.\nReengineering   these   legacy   systems   and\nreplacing   it   with   the   online   Aadhaar\nauthentication   at   the   time   of   food­grain\ndelivery   will   take   time.   This   is   therefore\nproposed as Component II.\n\n12. As far as possible, the State Governments\nshould   be   directed   to   link   the   process   of\ncomputerisation   of   Component   2   with   Aadhaar\nregistration.   This   will  help   in  streamlining\nthe   process   of   biometric   collection   as   well\nas   authentication.   The   States/UTs   may   be\nencouraged   to   include   the   PDs   related   KYR+\nfield   in   the   data   collection   exercise   being\nundertaken   by   various   Registrars   across   the\ncountry   as   part   of   the   UID   (Aadhaar)\nenrolment.”\n\n211.   This   Court   again   in   the   same   proceeding   passed\n\nanother   judgment   on   16.03.2012  PUCL   vs.   Union   of\n\nIndia, (2013) 14 SCC 368 in which following was stated\n\nin paragraphs 2 and 4:\n\n“2.  There   seems   to   be   a   general   consensus\nthat   computerisation   is   going   to   help   the\npublic distribution system in the country in\na big way. In the affidavit it is stated that\nthe   Department   of   Food   and   Public\nDistribution has been pursuing the States to\nundertake   special   drive   to   eliminate\nbogus/duplicate ration cards and as a result,\n209.55 lakh ration cards have been eliminated\nsince 2006 and the annual saving of foodgrain\nsubsidy   has   worked   out   to   about   Rs   8200\ncrores per annum. It is further mentioned in\nthe affidavit that end­to­end computerisation\nof   public   distribution   system   comprises\ncreation   and   management   of   digitised\nbeneficiary   database   including   biometric\nidentification   of   the   beneficiaries,   supply\nchain   management   of   TPDS   commodities   till\nfair price shops.\n\n4.  In   the   affidavit   it   is   further   mentioned\nthat   the   Government   of   India   has   set   up   a\ntask   force   under   the   Chairmanship   of   Mr\nNandan   Nilekani,   Chairman,   UIDAI,   to\nrecommend, amongst others, an IT strategy for\nthe public distribution system. We request Mr\nNandan Nilekani to suggest us ways and means\nby   which   computerisation   process   of   the\npublic   distribution  system   can   be   expedited.\n\nLet   a   brief   report/affidavit   be   filed   by   Mr\nNandan   Nilekani   within   four   weeks   from\ntoday.”\n\n212.   As   noted   above   the   figures   as   claimed   by   the\n\nrespondents regarding benefits after implementation of\n\nAadhaar scheme in the MGNREGA and PDS etc. are refuted\n\nby the petitioners. Petitioners’ case is that amounts\n\nof   savings   which   are   claimed   are   not   correct   and   at\n\nbest there was only meager benefit of savings from the\n\nimplementation   of   the   scheme.     We   need   not   to   enter\ninto   the   issue   regarding   respective   claims   in   the\n\nabove   regard.   The   reasons   which   led   to   enactment   of\n\nSection   7\nthat   benefits   and   subsidies   are\n\nsubstantially diverted and are not able to reach have\n\nbeen made out even if saving were not substantial but\n\nmeager.\n\n213.   The report and material which have been brought\n\non   record   by   the   Government   fully   demonstrate   the\n\nlegitimate   aim   of   the   State   in   enacting\nSection   7\n.\n\nThis   Court   in\nFrancis   Coralie   Mullin   vs.\n\nAdministrator,   Union   Territory   of   Delhi   and   others\n,\n\n1981 (1)  SCC 608,  while elaborating on  right  of life\n\nunder\nArticle 21\n, held that the right to life includes\n\nthe right to live with dignity and all that goes along\n\nwith   it   namely   the   bar   necessaries   of   life   such   as\n\nadequate nutrition, clothing and shelter.\n\n214.   The United Nation under Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights also acknowledges everyone has a right to\n\nstandard   of   living   which   includes   food,   clothing,\n\nhousing   and   medical   care.\nArticle   25\nof   the\n\nDeclaration which was made in 1948 is as follows:\n“25.1 Everyone has the right to a standard\nof   living   adequate   for   the   health   and   well­\nbeing of himself and of his family, including\nfood,   clothing,     housing       and       medical\ncare   and\nnecessary   social   services,   and   the   right   to\nsecurity   in   the   event   of   unemployment,\nsickness,   disability,   widowhood,   old   age   or\nother   lack   of   livelihood   in   circumstances\nbeyond his control.”\n\n215.   The English author, JOHN BERGER said:\n\n“The poverty of our century is unlike that of\nany other. It is not, as poverty was before,\nthe result of natural scarcity, but of a set\nof   priorities   imposed   upon   the   rest   of   the\nworld   by   the   rich.   Consequently,   the   modern\npoor   are   not   pitied...but   written   off   as\ntrash.”\n\n216.   The identification of the poor, as was referred\n\nby  John   Berger  is   the   first   step   to   realise   the   UN\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights as well as the Fundamental\n\nRights guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The\n\nAadhaar   Act   brings   into   existence   a   process   of\n\nidentification   which   is   more   accurate   as   compared   to\n\nother identity proofs.\n217.   At   this   stage,   we   need   to   notice   one   more\n\nsubmission   which   was   raised by   the   learned   Attorney\n\nGeneral. It has been submitted by the learned Attorney\n\nGeneral that subsidies and benefits under Section 7 of\n\nthe   Aadhaar   Act   are   traceable   to\nArticle   21.\nIt   is\n\nsubmitted   that   if   the   rights   which   are   sought   to   be\n\nrealised by means of\nSection 7\nare juxtaposed  against\n\nthe right of privacy, the former will prevail over the\n\nlatter.   The   issue   is   as   to   whether   the   State   by\n\nenlivening   right   to   food   and   shelter   envisaged   under\n\nArticle 21\nencroach upon the right of privacy ? There\n\ncannot be a denial that there may be inter se conflict\n\nbetween   fundamental   rights   recognised   by   the\n\nConstitution in reference to a particular person. The\n\nCourt   has to   strive   a balance   to   leave   enough   space\n\nfor exercise of both the fundamental rights.\n\n218.   It cannot be  accepted that while balancing the\n\nfundamental   rights   one   right   has   to   be   given\n\npreference.   We   may   notice   that   privacy   judgment   i.e.\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase      has   noticed   and   already   rejected\nthis   argument   raised   by   the   learned   Attorney   General\n\nin paragraph 266 in the following words:\n\n“266.   The   Attorney   General   argued   before   us\nthat the right to privacy must be forsaken in\nthe interest of welfare entitlements provided\nby   the   State.   In   our   view,   the   submission\nthat   the   right   to   privacy   is   an   elitist\nconstruct   which   stands   apart   from   the   needs\nand   aspirations   of   the   large   majority\nconstituting   the   rest   of   society,   is\nunsustainable.   This   submission   betrays   a\nmisunderstanding   of   the   constitutional\nposition.   Our   Constitution   places   the\nindividual   at   the   forefront   of   its   focus,\nguaranteeing   civil   and   political   rights   in\nPart   III   and   embodying   an   aspiration   for\nachieving   socio­economic   rights   in   Part   IV.\nThe  refrain  that  the   poor  need  no  civil  and\npolitical rights and are concerned only with\neconomic well­being has been utilised through\nhistory   to   wreak   the   most   egregious\nviolations of human rights....”\n\n219.  One of the submissions which has been raised\n\nby   the   petitioners   targeting   the   Aadhaar\n\nauthentication   is   that   biometric   system   under   the\n\nAadhaar   architecture   is   probabilistic.   Biometric\n\ntechnology does not guarantee 100% accuracy and it is\n\nfallible,   with   inevitable   false   positives   and   false\n\nnegatives   that   are   design   flaws   of   such   a\n\nprobabilistic system. We have noted above the reliance\non UIDAI’s Report of the year 2012 where UIDAI itself\n\nhas   claimed   that   biometric   accuracy   was   99.768%.   The\n\npetitioner   is   still   criticising   that   since   .232%\n\nfailures   are   there   which   comes   to   27.65   lakh   people\n\nwho are excluded from benefits linked to Aadhaar. The\n\nabove submission of the petitioner ignores one aspect\n\nof the matter as has been contended by the respondents\n\nthat in case where there is biometric mis­match of  a\n\nperson even possession of an Aadhaar number is treated\n\nsufficient   for   delivery   of   subsidies   and   benefits.\n\nThus,   physical   possession   of   Aadhaar   card   itself   may\n\nmitigate biometric mis­match. However, in case of mis­\n\nmatch   instruments   are   there   to   accept   other   proof   of\n\nidentity,   the   respondents   have   referred   to   Circular\n\ndated   24.10.2017   issued   by   UIDAI.   The   Circular   dated\n\n24.10.2017   has   been   criticised   by   the   petitioners\n\nstating   that   violation   of   right   cannot   be   left   to\n\nvagaries   of   administration.   There   cannot   be   any\n\ndispute   to   the   above   propositions.   It   is   the\n\nobligation   of   the   State   to   ensure   that   there   is   no\n\nviolation of fundamental rights of a person.\nSection 7\nis   an   enabling   provision   which   empowers   the   State\n\nGovernment   to   require   that   such   individual   undergo\n\nauthentication   for   receipt   of   a   subsidy,   benefit   or\n\nservice but neither\nSection 7\nnor orders issued by the\n\nCentral   Government   and   State   Government   can     be   read\n\nthat   in   the   event     authentication   of   a   person   or\n\nbeneficiary   fails,   he   is   not   to   be   provided   the\n\nsubsidies   and   benefits   or   services.   The   provision   is\n\ncouched as an enabling provision but it cannot be read\n\nas a provision to negate giving subsidies, benefits or\n\nservices in the event of failure of authentication. We\n\nare   of   the   view   that   Circular   dated   24.10.2017   which\n\nfills   a   gap   and   is   a   direction   facilitating   delivery\n\nof   benefits   and   subsidies   does   not   breach   by\n\nprovisions of the Act.\n\n220.     Now,   we   come   to   arguments   of   exclusion   as\n\nadvanced   by   the   petitioners   in   support   of   their\n\nsubmission   that   exclusion   makes\nSection   7\narbitrary\n\nand violative of\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\nFrom the material\n\nbrought on record by the parties, we have no reason to\n\ndoubt that there has been denial to few persons due to\nfailure of authentication. There is ample material on\n\nrecord   to   indicate   that   prior   to   enforcement   of\n\nAadhaar   Scheme   there   had   been   large   number   of   denial\n\nof benefits and subsidies to real beneficiaries due to\n\nseveral reasons as noted above. Functioning of scheme\n\nformulated by the Government for delivery of benefits\n\nand   subsidies   to   deserving   persons   is   a   large   scale\n\nscheme   running   into   every   nook   and   corner   of   the\n\ncountry.   When   such   scheme   of   Government   is\n\nimplemented,   it   is   not   uncommon   that   there   may   be\n\nshortcomings and some denial. There is no material on\n\nrecord to indicate that as compared to non­receipt of\n\neligible   beneficiaries   prior   to   enforcement   of   the\n\nAct,   there   is   increase   of   failure   after   the\n\nimplementation of the Act. It cannot be accepted that\n\nfew   cases   of   exclusion   as   pointed   out   by   the\n\npetitioners   makes\nSection   7\nitself   arbitrary   and\n\nviolative   of\nArticles   14\nand\n21.\nPitfalls   and\n\nshortcomings   are   to   remove   from   every   system   and   it\n\nhas   been   fairly   submitted   by   the   learned   Attorney\n\nGeneral as well as learned counsel for the UIDAI that\nas   and   when   difficulties   in   implementation   and   cases\n\nof   denial   are   brought   into   the   notice,   remedial\n\nmeasures are taken. The respondents are still ready to\n\ntake such remedial measures to ensure that there is no\n\ndenial of subsidies to deserving persons. We, however,\n\nare   of   the   view   that   denial   of   delivery   of   benefits\n\nand   subsidies   to   deserving   persons   is   a   serious\n\nconcern   and   violation   of   the rights   of   the   persons\n\nconcerned. It has to be tackled at all level and the\n\nadministration   has   to   gear   up   itself   and\n\nimplementation   authority   has   to   gear   up   itself   to\n\nensure that rightful beneficiaries are not denied the\n\nconstitutional benefits which have been recognised and\n\nwhich   are   being   implemented   by   the   different   schemes\n\nof   the   Government.   Both   the   Government   and   UIDAI   are\n\nfully   empowered   to   make   Rules   and   Regulations   under\n\nSections 53 and 54 of the Aadhaar Act respectively and\n\nexclusions   have   to   be   taken   care   by   exercising   the\n\npower   under\nSection   53\nby   the   Central   Government   and\n\nunder\nSection   54\nby   the   UIDAI   to   remedy   such\n\nshortcomings   and   denial.   We   are   sure   that   both   the\nCentral   Government   and   UIDAI   shall   advert   to   the\n\nexclusionary factors.\n\n221.   We may also notice a judgment of the US Supreme\n\nCourt in  Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human\n\nServices, et al. vs. Stephen J. Roy et al., 476 US 693\n\n(1986).  The   US   Supreme   Court   held   that   statutory\n\nrequirement   that   a   state   agency   utilise   Social\n\nSecurity   numbers   in   administering   the   programs   in\n\nquestion   does   not   violate   the   Free   Exercise   Clause.\n\nThe   appellants   applied   and   received   benefits     under\n\nthe   Aid   to   Families   with   Dependent   Children   program\n\nand the Food Stamp program. They, however, refused to\n\ncomply,   with   the   requirement   that   participants   in\n\nthese   programs   furnish   their   state   welfare   agencies\n\nwith   the   Social   Security   numbers   of   the   members   of\n\ntheir household as a condition of receiving benefits.\n\nAppellants   had   contended   that   obtaining   a   Social\n\nSecurity   number   for   their   2­year­old   daughter,   would\n\nviolate   their   Native   American   religious   beliefs.   On\n\nrefusal to give Social Number, benefits payable to the\n\nappellants   were   terminated.   The   claim   of   the\nappellants was dismissed. The challenge raised by the\n\nappellants was noticed in the following words:\n\n“Appellees   raise   a   constitutional   challenge\nto   two   features   of   the   statutory   scheme\nhere.4   They   object   to   Congress'   requirement\nthat   a   state   AFDC   plan   \"must   .   .   .   provide\n(A) that, as a condition of eligibility under\nthe plan, each applicant for or recipient of\naid   shall   furnish   to   the   State   agency   his\nsocial security account number.\" 42 U.S.C. §\n602(a)(25) (emphasis added). They also object\nto   Congress'   requirement   that   \"such   State\nagency shall utilize such account numbers . .\n\n. in the administration of such plan.\" Ibid.\n\n(emphasis   added).5   We   analyze   each   of   these\ncontentions, turning to the latter contention\nfirst.”\n\n222.  The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the requirement of\n\nproviding   of   Social   Security   number.   Following   has\n\nbeen observed:\n\n“The   general   governmental   interests   involved\nhere   buttress   this   conclusion.   Governments\ntoday   grant   a   broad   range   of   benefits;\n\ninescapably   at   the   same   time   the\nadministration   of   complex   programs   requires\ncertain conditions and restrictions. Although\nin some situations a mechanism for individual\nconsideration   will   be   created,   a   policy\ndecision   by   a   government   that   it   wishes   to\ntreat   all   applicants   alike   and   that   it   does\nnot   wish   to   become   involved   in   case­by­case\ninquiries   into   the   genuineness   of   each\nreligious   objection   to   such   condition   or\nrestrictions is entitled to substantial\ndeference. Moreover, legitimate interests are\nimplicated   in   the   need   to   avoid   any\nappearance   of   favoring   religious   over\nnonreligious applicants.\n\nThe   test   applied   in   cases   like   Wisconsin   v.\nYoder, U.\nS. 205\n,\nS.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15\n(1972),   is   not   appropriate   in   this   setting.\n\nIn the enforcement of a facially neutral and\nuniformly   applicable   requirement   for   the\nadministration   of   welfare   programs   reaching\nmany   millions   of   people,   the   Government   is\nentitled   to   wide   latitude.   The   Government\nshould not be put to the strict test applied\nby the District Court; that standard required\nthe Government to justify enforcement of the\nuse of Social Security number requirement as\nthe  least   restrictive   means  of   accomplishing\na   compelling   state   interest.17   Absent   proof\nof   an   intent   to   discriminate   against\nparticular   religious   beliefs   or   against\nreligion in general, the Government meets its\nburden when it demonstrates that a challenged\nrequirement   for   governmental   benefits,\nneutral and uniform in its application, is a\nreasonable   means   of   promoting   a   legitimate\npublic interest.”\n\n223.     Another   case   of   the   Appellate   Division   of   the\n\nSupreme Court of the State of New York which needs to\n\nbe noticed is  in the matter of Buchanan v. Wing, 664\n\nN.Y.   2d   865.  In   the   above   case   petitioners   were\n\nrecipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children,\n\nthe   facts   of   the   case   have   been   noticed   in   the\n\nfollowing words:\n“Petitioners   and   their   four   minor   children\nare   recipients   of   Aid   to   Families   with\nDepartment Children (hereinafter ADC) (Social\nServices   Law     343   et   seq.)   and   food   stamps\nfrom   the   Broome   County   Department   of   Social\nServices   (hereinafter   the   Department).   In\nFebruary   1996,   petitioners   received     notice\nfrom   the   Department   that   they   were   to\nparticipate   in   an   identity   verification\nprocedure   known   as   the   automated   finger\nimaging   system   (hereinafter   AFIS)   as   a\ncondition   of   eligibility   for   benefits\nrequired   by   18   NYCRR   351.2(a)(245   A.D.   2d\n\n635).   Petitioners   responded   that   they   would\nnot   participate   because   of   their   religious\nconvictions.   Respondent   Commissioner   of   the\nDepartment   thereafter   discontinued   their   ADC\nand   food   stamp   entitlements   for   failure   to\ncomply.”\n\n224.     The   petitioners   refused   to   participate   in an\n\nidentify verification by procedure known as automated\n\nfinger   imaging   system   which   was   a   condition   of\n\neligibility   for   benefits.   Upholding   the   process   of\n\nverification   by   finger   imaging   following   was   laid\n\ndown:\n\n“We have examined petitioners’ constitutional\nclaims and find them to be without merit. In\nour  view,   petitioners’   failure   to   articulate\na   viable   claim   that   they   are   being   required\nto participate in an invasive procedure that\nis   prohibited   by   their   religious   beliefs   is\ndispositive   of   their   arguments claiming   a\nviolation of their freedom to exercise their\nreligion   pursuant   to   the   Federal   and   State\nConstitutions (US Const 1st Amend; NY Const,\nart   I,   3).   We   are   also   unpersuaded   by\npetitioners’   contention   that   the   Department\nviolated   NY   Constitution,   article   XVII,   1\n(which   provides   that   aid   and   care   of   the\nneedy   are   public   concerns   and   shall   be\nprovided by the State) by discontinuing their\npublic assistance benefits. Since petitioners\ncannot be classified as needy until such time\nas   they   are   finger   imaged   to   determine\nwhether   they   are   receiving   duplicate\nbenefits, no violation of this constitutional\nprovision has been stated. Moreover, contrary\nto petitioners’ arguments, the discontinuance\nof   public   assistance   to   their   entire   family\nunit (see, 18 NYCRR 352.30)(245 A.D. 2d 637)\ndoes   not   infringe   the   constitutional   rights\nof   their   children   (who   are   not   named\npetitioners   in   light   of   valid   legislation\npremising   the   eligibility   of   the   children\nwithin   the   family   unit   upon   the   eligibility\nof   the   entire   household   (see,   Matter   of\nJessup v D’Elia, 69 N.Y. 2d 1030).”\n\n225.     Another   judgment   which   has   been   relied   by   the\n\nrespondents   is  Doris   McElrath   v.   Joseph   A.   Califano,\n\nJr.,   Secretary   of   Health,   Education   and   Welfare,   615\n\nF.2d   434.  Under   Social   Security   Act,   1935,   a   public\n\nassistance   program   of   federal   and   state   cooperation\n\nproviding   financial   aid   to   needy   dependent   children\n\nand   the   parents   or   relatives   with   whom   they   reside,\n\none   of   the   conditions   which   was   added   so   that   as   a\n\ncondition   of   eligibility   under   the   plan,   each\napplicant for or recipient of aid shall furnish to the\n\nState agency his social security account number.   The\n\ncontention   of the   appellant   was   noticed   in   paragraph\n\n11 which is to the following effect:\n\n“[11] The appellants' principal contention on\nappeal   is   that   the   federal   and   state\nregulations   requiring   dependent   children   to\nacquire   and   submit   social   security   account\nnumbers   as   a   condition   of   eligibility   for\nAFDC   benefits   are   statutorily   invalid   as\nbeing inconsistent with and not authorized by\nthe\nSocial   Security   Act\n.   We   find   the\narguments   advanced   in   support   of   this\ncontention to be without merit and hold that\nthe   challenged   regulations   constitute   a\nlegitimate   condition   of   eligibility   mandated\nby   the   Congress   under   the\nSocial   Security\nAct\n. Accord, Chambers v. Klein, 419 F. Supp.\n569   (D.N.J.   1976),   aff'd   mem.,   564   F.2d   89\n(3d Cir. 1977); Green v. Philbrook, 576 F.2d\n440   (2d   Cir.   1978);   Arthur   v.   Department   of\nSocial and Health Services, 19 Wn. App. 542,\n576   P.2d   921   (1978).   We   therefore   conclude\nthat   the   district   court   properly   dismissed\nthe   appellants'   statutory   invalidity\nallegations for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted.”\n\n226.  The appellant had also contended that disclosure\n\nof   social   security   account   number   violates   their\n\nconstitutional   rights   to   privacy.   Said   argument   was\nrejected.   While   rejecting   the   argument   following   was\n\nstated in paragraph 20:\n\n“[20]   Finally,   the   appellants   maintain   that\nthe social security account number disclosure\nrequirement   violates   their   constitutional\nrights to privacy and to equal protection of\nthe   law.   We   disagree.   The   constitutional\nguarantee   of   the   right   to   privacy   embodies\nonly those personal rights that can be deemed\n\"fundamental\" or \"implicit in the concept of\nordered   liberty.\"   Roe   v.   Wade,     :   410   U.\nS.\n,\n,\nS.Ct.  705,  726,   35  L.Ed.2d  147\n(1973).   It   is   equally   well­settled   that\n\"[w]elfare   benefits   are   not   a   fundamental\nright . . . .\" Lavine v. Milne, 424 U.S. 577,\n584,   n.   9,   96   S.Ct.   1010,   1015,   47   L.Ed.2d\n249   (1976).   Accordingly,   we   regard   the\ndecision   of   Mrs.   McElrath   whether   or   not   to\nobtain   social   security   account   numbers   for\nher   two   minor   children   in   order   to   receive\nwelfare   benefits   as   involving   neither   a\nfundamental right nor a right implicit in the\nconcept   of   ordered   liberty.   Chambers   v.\n\nKlein,   419   F.   Supp.   569,   583   (D.N.J.   1976),\naff'd  mem.  564   F.2d  89   (3d  Cir.  1977).  This\ncase   is   not   concerned   with   a   decision\nimpacting   the   privacy   of   the   appellants   on\nthe   magnitude   of   criminal   sanctions   or   an\nabsolute   prohibition   on   the   appellants'\nconduct. See, e. g., Griswold v. Connecticut,\n:  381  U.S.   479,\nS.Ct.   1678,   14  L.Ed.652d\n510   (1965);   Eisenstadt   v.   Baird,:   405   U.S.\n438,\nS.Ct.   1029,   31   L.Ed.2d   349   (1972).\n\nRather,   it   is   concerned   with   a   condition   of\nAFDC   eligibility   and   the   only   sanction   for\nnot   complying   is   to   forego   certain\ngovernmental   benefits.   Simply   stated,   the\nclaim   of   the   appellants   to   receive   welfare\nbenefits   on   their   own   informational   terms\ndoes   not   rise   to   the   level   of   a\nconstitutional   guarantee.   Moreover,   the\ncontention   that   disclosure   of   one's   social\nsecurity account number violates the right to\nprivacy   has   been   consistently   rejected   in\nother related contexts. See, e.g., Cantor v.\nSupreme   Court   of   Pennsylvania,   353   F.   Supp.\n\n1307, 1321­22 (E.D.Pa. 1973); Conant v. Hill,\n326 F. Supp. 25, 26 (E.D.Va. 1971).”\n\n227.     The   trends   of   judgments   as   noted   above   do\n\nindicate   that   condition   for   identification   or\n\ndisclosing particular identity number for receiving a\n\nbenefit   from   State   does   not   violate   any   of   the\n\nConstitutional rights. We, thus, find   that\nSection 7\n\nfulfills   the   three   fold   tests   as   laid   down   in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase.\n\n228.  Shri   Gopal   Subramanium   relying   on\nArticle   243G\n\nand Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution submits that\n\nAadhaar   Scheme   and   its   authentication   for   benefits,\n\nsubsidies   and   services   militate   against   the   above\n\nConstitution   provision   and   hence   are   ultra   vires   to\n\nthe   Constitution.\nArticle   243G\ndeals   with   powers,\n\nauthority and responsibilities of Panchayats, which is\n\nto the following effect:­\n243G.   Powers,   authority   and   responsibilities\nof Panchayats:­  Subject to the provisions of\nthis Constitution the Legislature of a State\nmay,   by   law,   endow   the   Panchayats   with   such\npowers and authority and may be necessary to\nenable   them   to   function   as   institutions   of\nself­government   and   such   law   may   contain\nprovisions   for   the   devolution   of   powers   and\nresponsibilities   upon   Panchayats,   at   the\nappropriate level, subject to such conditions\nas   may   be   specified   therein,   with   respect\nto­­­\n\n(a)   the   preparation   of   plans   for   economic\ndevelopment and social justice;\n\n(b)   the   implementation   of   schemes   for\neconomic   development   and   social   justice   as\nmay   be   entrusted   to   them   including   those   in\nrelation   to   the   matters   listed   in   the\nEleventh Schedule.\n\n229.\nArticle 243G(b)\nrefers to Eleventh Schedule to the\n\nConstitution.  Eleventh Schedule contains list of several\n\nmatters.  Shri Subramanium relies on Item No. 11, 12, 16,\n\n17, 23, 25 and 28, which are as under:­\n\n11. Drinking Water.\n\n12. Fuel and Fodder.\n\n16. Poverty alleviation programme.\n\n17. Education,   including   primary   and   secondary\n\nschools.\n23. Health   and   Sanitation,   including   hospitals,\n\nprimary health centres and dispensaries.\n\n25. Women and child development.\n\n28. Public distribution system.\n\n230.\nArticle 243G\nis an enabling provision, which enable\n\nthe   State   Legislature,   by   law,   to   endow   the   Panchayats\n\nwith such powers and authorities as may be necessary to\n\nenable   them   to  function   as   institutions   of   self­\n\ngovernment.   The Items on which State, by law, can endow\n\nPanchayats   in   Eleventh   Schedule   are   items   to   deal   with\n\nsubjects   enumerated   therein.     For   example,   Item   No.   16\n\ndeals with Poverty alleviation programme and Item No. 28\n\ndeals   with   Public   Distribution   System.     State   is   fully\n\ncompetent   to   make   laws   to   authorise   the   Panchayats   to\n\ntake   over   all   the   matters   enumerated   in   Eleventh\n\nSchedule.  The question to be considered is as to whether\n\nthe   Aadhaar   Act   in   any   manner   militate   with\n\nConstitutional   provisions   of\nArticle   243G.\nThe   Aadhaar\n\nAct is an Act enacted by Parliament, which is referable\n\nto Entry 97 of List I.  The Aadhaar Act has been enacted\nto   provide   for  efficient,   transparent,   and   targeted\n\ndelivery   of   subsidies,   benefits   and   services,   the\n\nexpenditure   for   which   is   incurred   from   the   Consolidated\n\nFund   of  India,   to   individuals   residing   in   India  through\n\nassigning of unique identity numbers to such individuals\n\nand for matters connected therewith.\nThe Act\n, thus, has\n\nbeen   enacted   to   regulate   the   expenditure,   which   is\n\nincurred   from   the   Consolidated   Fund   of   India.     No\n\nconflict between the Aadhaar Act and any law, which may\n\nbe enacted by State under List II is seen.   Even if any\n\nconflict is supposed, the Doctrine of Pith and Substance\n\nhas to be applied to find out nature of two legislations.\n\nIn Pith and Substance, the Aadhaar Act cannot be said to\n\nbe   entrenching   upon   any   law,   which   may   be   made   by   the\n\nState   under   Item   No.5   of   List   II.     In   this   context,\n\nreference is made to judgment of this Court in\nState of\n\nUttar   Pradesh   and   Another   Vs.   Zila   Parishad,   Ghaziabad\n\nand   Another\n,   (2013)   11   SCC   783.    In\nthe   above   case\n,\n\nprovisions   of\nArticle   243G\ncame   to   be   considered   in\n\nreference   to   public   distribution   orders   issued   by   the\n\nState   Government   in   exercise   of   delegated   powers   under\nEssential Commodities Act, 1955\n.   The Central Government\n\nin   exercise   of   power   under\nSection   3\nof   the   Essential\n\nCommodities  Act,   the   Government  of   U.P.  issued   an   order\n\ndated 10.8.1999, conferring the power to allot and cancel\n\nthe   fair   price   shops   in   rural   areas,   with   certain\n\nguidelines,   on   the   Gram   Panchayats.     Subsequently,   the\n\nState   Government   withdrew   that   order   and   reinforced   the\n\nearlier policy dated 03.07.1990 under which the power was\n\nvested   with   the   District   Magistrate   or   an   authority\n\ndesignated   by   him   to   allot   or   cancel   the   licenses   for\n\nFair Price Shops.  The Central Government, in exercise of\n\npower   under\nSection  3\nof   the   Essential   Commodities   Act,\n\nissued an order dated 31.8.2001, wherein its powers were\n\ndelegated   to   State   Government.     State   Government,   in\n\npursuance   thereof,   issued   an   order   designating   the\n\nofficers   of   the   District   level,   viz.,   District\n\nMagistrate,   Sub­Divisional   Magistrate,   District   Supply\n\nOfficer  to   ensure   the   proper   supply  and  distribution   of\n\nsuch commodities.   Zila Parishad, Ghaziabad filed a Writ\n\nPetition   in   the   High   Court   challenging   the   Order   dated\n\n13.01.2000 by which the power was withdrawn from the Gram\nPanchayats.     The   Writ   Petition   was   allowed   by   the   High\n\nCourt   against   which   State   of   Uttar   Pradesh   filed   an\n\nappeal.   The submission was raised before this Court on\n\nbehalf   of   the   writ   petitioner   that   denuding   the   power\n\nfrom   Panchayats   will   be   against   the   constitutional\n\nprovision   of\nArticle   243G.\nSuch   argument   on   behalf   of\n\npetitioner has been noticed in Paragraph 14.   This Court\n\nafter   considering   the   provisions   of\nArticle   243G\nand\n\nother relevant provisions has\nlaid down in\nParas 23 and\n\n24:­\n\n“23. The High Court has considered the nature\nof the aforesaid constitutional provision and\nheld as under: (Zila Panchayat case1, AWC pp.\n3981­82, para 16)\n\n“16. In our opinion, this provision\nis   only   an   enabling   provision.   It\nenables   the   Legislature   of   a   State\nto endow the Panchayats with certain\npowers. … Hence, the Legislature of\na   State   is   not   bound   to   endow   the\nPanchayats   with  the  powers  referred\nto   Article  243­G,  and  it  is  in   its\ndiscretion   to  do  so  or   not.  At   any\nevent   there   is   no   mention   of   the\npublic   distribution   system   in\nArticle 243­G of the Constitution.”\n\nThus, it is evident that the High Court has\ntaken   a   view   that   the   provision   of   Article\n243­G is merely an enabling provision, and it\nis   not   a   source   of   legislation.\n\nThis   view\nseems to be in consonance with the law\nlaid\ndown   by\nthis   Court   in\nU.P.   Gram   Panchayat\nAdhikari Sangh  v.  Daya Ram Saroj4\nwherein an\nobservation has been made that Article 243­G\nis   an   enabling   provision   as   it   enables   the\nPanchayats   to   function   as   institutions   of\nself­government.   Further,   this   Court   noted\nthat such law may contain provisions for the\ndevolution   of   powers   and   responsibilities\nupon   Panchayats,   subject   to   such   conditions\nas may be specified therein, with respect to\nthe   implementation   of   schemes   for   economic\ndevelopment   and   social   justice   as   may   be\nentrusted   to   them,   including   those   in\nrelations   to   the   matters   listed   in   the\nEleventh   Schedule.   The   enabling   provisions\nare further subject to the conditions as may\nbe specified. Therefore, it is for the State\nLegislature   to   consider   conditions   and   to\nmake laws accordingly. It is also open to the\nState to eliminate or modify the same.\n\n24.  Therefore,   it   is   apparent   that   Article\n243­G read with the Eleventh Schedule is not\na source of legislative power, and it is only\nan   enabling   provision   that   empowers   a   State\nto   endow   functions   and   devolve   powers   and\nresponsibilities to local bodies by enacting\nrelevant   laws.   The   local   bodies   can   only\nimplement   the   schemes   entrusted   to   them   by\nthe State.”\n\n231.   This   Court\nin\nthe   above   case\nhas   reiterated   that\n\nArticle 243G\nread with Eleventh Schedule is not a source\n\nof   legislative   power,   and   it   is   only   an   enabling\n\nprovision   that   empowers   a   State   to   endow   functions   and\ndevolve   powers   and   responsibilities   to   local   bodies   by\n\nenacting relevant laws.   We, thus, are unable to accept\n\nthe submission of Shri Gopal Subramanium that Aadhaar Act\n\nis ultra vires to\nArticle 243G\nand Eleventh Schedule to\n\nthe Constitution.\n\n232.   One   more   submission   of  the  petitioners  which   needs\n\nto   be   considered   is   regarding   probabilistic   nature   of\n\nbiometric   solution.   We   proceed   on   premise   that   Aadhaar\n\nstructure   is   probabilistic,   the   petitioners   themselves\n\nhave   referred   to   UIDAI   Report   where   biometric   accuracy\n\nhas   been   stated   to   be   99.768%.   Stephen   Hawkin   in   his\n\nbook: “God Created The Integers” states:\n\n“Over   the   centuries,   the   efforts   of   these\nmathematicians have helped the human race to\nachieve   great   insight   into   nature,   such   as\nthe realisation that the earth is round, that\nthe  same   force   that  causes   an  apple  to  fall\nhere   on   earth   is   also   responsible   for   the\nmotions of the heavenly bodies, that space is\nfinite   and   not   eternal,   that   time   and   space\nare   intertwined   and   warped   by   matter   and\nenergy,   and   that   the   future   can   only   be\ndetermined   probabilistically.   Such\nrevolutions in the way we perceive the world\nhave   always   gone   hand   in   hand   with\nrevolutions   in   mathematical   thought.   Isaac\nNewton   could   never   have   formulated   his   laws\nwithout   the   analytic   geometry   of   Rene\nDescartes   and   Newton’s   own   invention   of\ncalculus.   It   is   hard   to   imagine   the\ndevelopment   of   either   electrodynamics   or\nquantum   theory   without   the   methods   of   Jean\nBaptiste   Joseph   Fourier   or   the   work   on\ncalculus and the theory of complex functions\npioneered   by   Carl   Friedrich   Gauss   and\nAugustin   Louis   Cauchy­   and   it   was   Henri\nLebesgue’s work on the theory of measure that\nenabled   John   von   Neumann   to   formulate   the\nrigorous understanding of quantum theory that\nwe have today. Albert Einstein could not have\ncompleted   his   general   theory   of   relativity\nhad   it   not   been   for   the   geometric   ideas   of\nBernhard   Riemann.   And   practically   all   of\nmodern   science   would   be   far   less   potent   (if\nit   existed   at   all)   without   the   concepts   of\nprobability   and   statistics   pioneered   by\nPierre­Simon Laplace.”\n\n233.  The science and technology keeps on changing with\n\npace   of   time.   A   scientific   invention   or   module   which\n\nis invented or launched keeps on improving with time.\n\nThe   ready   example   is   improvement   in   quality   and\n\nprogrammes   of   mobile   phone   which   has   seen   steep\n\ndevelopment   in   the   last   one   decade.   Even   if\n\nauthentication   under   Aadhaar   scheme   is   probabilistic\n\nas   on   date,   we   have   no   doubt   that   the   steps   will   be\n\ntaken   to   minimise   the   mis­natch   and   to   attain   more\n\naccuracy   in   the   result.     In   view   of   the   foregoing\n\ndiscussion we are of the view that the State has given\nsufficient   justification   to   uphold   the\n\nconstitutionality of\nSection   7\n.   We,   thus,   answer\n\nQuestion Nos.6 and 7 in the following manner:\n\nAns.6:­\nSection   7\nof   the   Aadhaar   is\n\nconstitutional.   The   provision   does   not\n\ndeserve to be struck down on account of\n\ndenial in some cases of right to claim on\n\naccount of failure of authentication.\n\nAns.7:­ The State while enlivening right to food,\n\nright   to   shelter   etc.   envisaged   under\n\nArticle 21\ncannot encroach upon the right\n\nof   privacy   of   beneficiaries   nor   former\n\ncan be given precedence over the latter.\n\nIssue No.8 Whether   Section   29   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   is\nliable to be struck down?\n\n234. The   ground   to   challenge\nSection   29\nis   that   it\n\npermits   sharing   of   identity   information.     It   is\n\nsubmitted   that   sharing   of   identity   information   is\n\nbreach   of   Right   of   Privacy.\nSection   29\nis   a\nprovision,   which   contains   restrictions   on   sharing\n\ninformation   as   is   clear   from   the   heading   of   the\n\nsection.\nSection   29\nsub­section   (1)   contains\n\nprohibition   on   sharing   of   any   core   biometric\n\ninformation   collected   or   created   under   this   Act.\n\nSection 29\nfor ready reference is extracted as below:­\n\n29.   Restriction   on   sharing   information.  (1)\nNo   core   biometric   information,   collected   or\ncreated under this Act, shall be—\n\n(a) shared with anyone for any reason\nwhatsoever; or\n\n(b) used for any purpose other than\ngeneration   of   Aadhaar   numbers   and\nauthentication under this Act.\n\n(2) The identity information, other than core\nbiometric   information,   collected   or   created\nunder   this   Act   may   be   shared   only   in\naccordance   with   the   provisions   of   this   Act\nand   in   such   manner   as   may   be   specified   by\nregulations.\n\n(3) No identity information available with a\nrequesting entity shall be—\n\n(a) used for any purpose, other than\nthat   specified   to   the   individual   at\nthe   time   of   submitting   any   identity\ninformation for authentication; or\n\n(b)   disclosed   further,   except   with\nthe   prior   consent   of   the   individual\nto whom such information relates.\n(4)   No   Aadhaar   number   or   core   biometric\ninformation   collected   or   created   under   this\nAct   in   respect   of   an   Aadhaar   number   holder\nshall   be   published,   displayed   or   posted\npublicly,   except   for   the   purposes   as   may   be\nspecified by regulations.\n\n235.   Sub­section   (2)   permits   sharing   of   identity\n\ninformation,   other   than   core   biometric   information,\n\nonly in accordance with the provisions of this Act and\n\nin   such   manner   as   may   be   specified   by   regulations.\n\nFurther sub­section (3) prohibits requesting entity to\n\nuse   identity   information   for   any   purpose   other   than\n\nthat   specified   to   the   individual   or   to   disclose   any\n\ninformation   without   the   consent   of   individual.     Sub­\n\nsection   (4)   provides   that   no   Aadhaar   number   or   core\n\nbiometric information shall be published, displayed or\n\nposted   publicly,   except   for   the   purposes   as   may   be\n\nspecified   by   regulations.     The   attack   on\nSection   29\n\nthat it permits sharing of information is thus wholly\n\nmisconceived.   The   objective   of   the   Act   is   to   protect\n\nthe   information   and   privacy   of   an   individual   and   so\n\nthe   Section   is   not   liable   to   be   struck   down   on   the\n\nspecious   ground   that   it   permits   sharing   of   the\ninformation.   Further   sub­section   (3)   engraft   a\n\nprovision   of   sharing   identity   information   by\n\nrequesting   entity   with   consent   of   the   individual.\n\nWhen   a   person   consents   about   sharing   of   his   identity\n\ninformation,   he   cannot   complain   breach   of   Privacy\n\nRight. Petitioners take exception of provision of sub­\n\nsection(2),   which   permits   identity   information   other\n\nthan   core   biometric   information   to   be   shared   in\n\naccordance with the provisions of this Act and in such\n\nmanner  as may be  specified  by the regulations.   When\n\nan Act or Regulation regulates and controls sharing of\n\nthe   information,   the   provision   is   regulatory   and   has\n\nbeen engrafted to protect individual's Privacy Right.\n\nThe Aadhaar (Sharing of Information) Regulations, 2016\n\nagain contains in Chapter II ­ Restrictions on sharing\n\nof identity information.\nRegulation 3\nis restriction\n\non   Authority.\nRegulation   4\nis   restriction   on\n\nrequesting entity.\nRegulation 5\nfixes responsibility\n\nof   any   agency   or   entity   other   than   requesting   entity\n\nwith respect to Aadhaar number.\nRegulation 6\nprovides\n\nrestriction   on   sharing,   circulating   or   publishing   of\nAadhaar number.\n\n236.  We, thus, conclude that the provision of\nSection\nand the Sharing Regulations contains a restriction\n\nand cannot be in any manner be held to violate any of\n\nthe   constitutional   rights   of   a   person.     Objective   of\n\nthe   Act   is   to   put   restrictions   on   the   sharing\n\ninformation,   which   also   is   a   legitimate   State   aim.\n\nThe   provision   under\nSection   29\nwhich   permits   sharing\n\nof   identity   information   except   core   biometric\n\ninformation in accordance with the Act and Regulations\n\ncannot   be   said   to   be   disproportionate   nor\n\nunreasonable.   Legislature   can   very   well   enumerates\n\ncircumstances   and   conditions   where   sharing   of\n\ninformation   becomes   necessary.     One   of   the\n\ncircumstances   where   sharing   of   the   information   is\n\nspecifically   engrafted   in   sub­section(2)   of\nSection\n,   which   provides   that   nothing   contained   in   sub­\n\nsection   (3)   of\nSection   29\nshall   apply   in   respect   of\n\nany   disclosure   of   information,   including   identity\n\ninformation   or   authentication   records,  made   in   the\n\ninterest   of   national   security  in   pursuance   of a\ndirection   of   an   officer   not   below   the   rank   of   Joint\n\nSecretary   to   the   Government   of   India.     Thus,   the\n\ncircumstances   which   can   contemplate   for   sharing\n\ninformation   is   reasonable   and   proportionate.     We,\n\nthus,   held   that   provisions   of\nSection   29\nis\n\nconstitutional   and   does   not   deserves   to   be   struck\n\ndown.     Issue   No.   8   is   answered   in   the   following\n\nmanner:­\n\nAns.8:­ Provisions   of\nSection   29\nis   constitutional\n\nand does not deserves to be struck down.\n\nIssue No.9 Whether\nSection 33\nis Constitutional ?\n\n237.\nSection   33\nof   the   Aadhaar   Act,   2016   is   as\nfollows:\n\n“33.   Disclosure   of   information   in   certain\ncases.­(1)   Nothing   contained   in   sub­section\n(2) or sub­section (5) of\nsection 28\nor sub­\nsection   (2)   of\nsection   29\nshall   apply   in\nrespect   of   any   disclosure   of   information,\nincluding   identity   information   or\nauthentication   records,   made   pursuant   to   an\norder   of   a   court   not   inferior   to   that   of   a\nDistrict Judge:\n\nProvided that no order by the court under\nthis sub­section shall be made without giving\nan opportunity of hearing to the Authority.\n(2)   Nothing   contained   in   sub­section   (2)   or\nsub­section (5) of\nsection 28\nand clause (b)\nof   sub­section   (1),   sub­section   (2)   or   sub­\nsection   (3)   of\nsection   29\nshall   apply   in\nrespect   of   any   disclosure   of   information,\nincluding   identity   information   records,   made\nin   the   interest   of   national   security   in\npursuance   of   a   direction   of   an   officer   not\nbelow   the   rank   of   Joint   Secretary   to   the\nGovernment   of   India   specially   authorised   in\nthis   behalf   by   an   order   of   the   Central\nGovernment:\n\nProvided   that   every   direction   issued\nunder this sub­section, shall be reviewed by\nan   Oversight   Committee   consisting   of   the\nCabinet Secretary and the Secretaries to the\nGovernment   of   India   in   the   Department   of\nLegal   Affairs   and   the   Department   of\nElectronics   and   Information   Technology,\nbefore it takes effect:\n\nProvided   further   that   any   direction\nissued under this sub­section shall be valid\nfor a period of three months from the date of\nits   issue,   which   may   be   extended   for   a\nfurther   period   of   three   months   after   the\nreview by the Oversight Committee.”\n\n238.   The first limb of argument of the petitioner is\n\nthat\nSection 33\nis unconstitutional since it provides\n\nfor   the   use   of   the   Aadhaar   data   base   for   Police\n\nverification   which   violates   the   protection   against\n\nself­incrimination as enshrined under\nArticle 20(3)\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India.\n239.   Sub­section (1) of\nSection 33\ncontains an ample\n\nrestriction   in   respect   of   any   disclosure   information\n\nwhich can be done only in pursuance of an order of the\n\ncourt   not inferior   to   that   of   a   District   Judge.   The\n\nrestriction in disclosure of information is reasonable\n\nand has valid justification. The authority whose duty\n\nis to safeguard the entire data has to be heard before\n\npassing an order by the court which amply protects the\n\ninterest of a person whose data is to be disclosed. An\n\norder of the court not inferior to that of a District\n\nJudge for disclosure of information itself is an ample\n\nprotection   to that,   for   no   unreasonable   purpose   data\n\nshall   be   disclosed.   Attacking   on   sub­section   (2)   of\n\nSection   33\n,   it   is   contended   that   although\n\n(i)disclosure of information has been permitted in the\n\ninterest   of   the   national   security   but   there   is   no\n\ndefinition   of   national   security,   (ii)   there   is   no\n\nindependent   oversight   disclosure   of   such   data   on   the\n\nground of security, (iii)the provision is neither fair\n\nnor   reasonable.   Section   (2)   of\nSection   33\nis\n\ndisproportionate and unconstitutional.\n240.\nSection   33\nsub­section   (2)   contains   two\n\nsafeguards.   Firstly,   disclosure   of   information   is   to\n\nbe   made   in   the   interest   of   national   security   and\n\nsecondly,   in   pursuance   of   a   direction   of   an   officer\n\nnot   below   the   rank   of   Joint   Secretary   to   the\n\nGovernment, who is specially authorised in this behalf\n\nby   an   order   of   the   Central   Government.   National\n\nsecurity,   thus,   has   to   be   determined   by   a   higher\n\nofficer who is specifically authorised in this behalf.\n\nThis   Court   in\nEx.   Armymen's   Protection   Services   P.\n\nLtd. Vs.  Union of India (UOI) and Ors.\n, 2014 (5) SCC\n\n409, has held that what is in the interest of national\n\nsecurity   is   not   a   question   of   law   but   that   it   is\n\nmatter   of   a   policy.   Following   was   held   in   paragraphs\n\n16 and 17:\n\n“16.   What   is   in   the   interest   of   national\nsecurity   is   not   a   question   of   law.   It   is   a\nmatter of policy. It is not for the court to\ndecide   whether   something   is   in   the   interest\nof   State   or   not.   It   should   be   left   to   the\nExecutive. To quote Lord Hoffman in Secretary\nof   State   for   the   Home   Department   v.   Rehman\n(2003) 1 AC 153:...in the matter of national\nsecurity   is   not   a   question   of   law.   It   is   a\nmatter   of judgment   and   policy.   Under   the\nConstitution   of   the   United   Kingdom   and   most\nother   countries,   decisions   as   to   whether\nsomething   is   or   is   not   in   the   interest   of\nnational   security   are   not   a   matter   for\njudicial decision. They are entrusted to the\nexecutive.\n\n17.   Thus,   in   a   situation   of   national\nsecurity,   a   party   cannot   insist   for   the\nstrict   observance   of   the   principles   of\nnatural justice. In such cases it is the duty\nof   the   Court   to   read   into   and   provide   for\nstatutory   exclusion,   if   not   expressly\nprovided   in   the   rules   governing   the   field.\n\nDepending   on   the   facts   of   the   particular\ncase, it will however be open to the court to\nsatisfy itself whether there were justifiable\nfacts,   and   in   that   regard,   the   court   is\nentitled   to   call   for   the   files   and   see\nwhether   it   is   a   case   where   the   interest   of\nnational security is involved. Once the State\nis   of   the   stand   that   the   issue   involves\nnational   security,   the   court   shall   not\ndisclose the reasons to the affected party.”\n\n241.   The   International   Courts   have   also   dealt   the\n\nissue.   In   a   case,   namely,\nCensus   Act\n(BverfGE   65,   1),\n\njudgment   of   Federal   Constitution   Court   of   Germany,\n\njudgment   dated   11.10.2013,   the   Court   had   occasion   to\n\nconsider   the   case   in   the   context   of   data   processing\n\nand protection of individual information against self­\n\nincrimination  and use of their personal data. Dealing\n\nwith   right   of   information   and   self­determination   the\n\nCourt held that individuals have no right in the sense\n\nof   absolute,   unrestricted   control   over   their   data.\nFollowing was held by the Court:\n\n“The guarantee of this right to informational\nself­determination”   is   not   entirely\nunrestricted.   Individuals   have   no   right   in\nthe   sense   of   absolute,   unrestricted   control\nover   their   data;   they   are   after   all   human\npersons   who   develop   within   the   social\nCommunity   and   are   dependent   upon\ncommunication.   Information,   even   if   related\nto   individual   persons,   represents   a\nreflection of societal reality that cannot be\nexclusively   assigned   solely   to   the   parties\naffected.   The   Basic   Law,   as   has   been\nemphasized   several   times   in   the   case   law   of\nthe Federal Constitutional Court, embodies in\nnegotiating   the   tension   between   the\nindividual   and   the   Community   a   decision   in\nfavour   of   civic   participation   and   civic\nresponsibility(see BverfGE 4, 7 [15] ; 8, 274\n[329]; 27, 344 [351 and 352]; 33, 303 [334];\n50, 290 [353]; 56, 37 [49]).\n\nIndividuals   must   therefore   in   principle\naccept   restriction   on   their   right   to\ninformational   self­determination   in   the\noverriding general public interest.”\n\n242. Another judgment of European Commission of Human\n\nRights   in  M.S.   against   Sweden  was   a   case   that\n\napplicant   has   complained   that   copies   of   her   medical\n\nrecords containing information on treatment have been\n\nforwarded by the clinic without her information to the\n\nInsurance Co. The case of the applicant was noticed in\n\nparagraph 39 which is to the following effect:\n“39. The   applicant   submits   that   the   women’s\nclinic’s submission of copies of her medical\nrecords   to   the   Social   Insurance   Office\nwithout   her   knowledge   or   consent   interfered\nwith   her   right   to   respect   for   her   private\nlife.   She   maintains   that   the   information\ncontained   in   these   records   were   of   a   highly\nsensitive   and   private   nature.   Allegedly,   she\ncould   not   anticipate,   when   she   claimed\ncompensation   from   the   Office,   that\ninformation on the abortion performed several\nyears   after   alleged   back   injury   would   be\nforwarded   to   the   Office.   She   further   refers\nto the fact that the information in question\nis   not   protected   by   the   same   level   of\nconfidentiality   at   the   Office   as   at   the\nclinic.”\n\n243.   The Commission held that information was rightly\n\nsubmitted to the Insurance Co. in accordance with law.\n\nIt   is   also   relevant   to   refer   the   judgment   of   this\n\nCourt   in  People’s   Union   for\nCivil   Liberties(PUCL)   v.\n\nUnion   of   India\n,   1997   (1)   SCC   301,  where   the   writ\n\npetition   was   filed   under\nArticle   32\nalleging   serious\n\ninvasion of an individual’s privacy on the account of\n\nTelephone­tapping.   The   Court   adverted   to   the\nIndian\n\nTelegraph   Act,   1885\nand   the   Rules   framed   thereunder.\n\nThe   Court   has   noticed   that\nSection   5(2)\nof   the\n\nTelegraph Act permits the interception of messages in\n\naccordance with the said section, “Occurrence of any\npublic   emergency”   or   “in   the   interest   of   public\n\nsafety”. In paragraph 28 following was held:\n\n“28.\nSection   5(2)\nof   the   Act   permits   the\ninterception   of   messages   in   accordance   with\nthe   provisions   of   the   said   Section.\n\n\"Occurrence   of   any   public   emergency\"   or   \"in\nthe   interest   of   public   safety\"   are   the   sine\nqua   non.   for   the   application   of   the\nprovisions of\nSection 5(2)\nof the Apt. Unless\na   public   emergency   has   occurred   or   the\ninterest   of   public   safety   demands,   the\nauthorities  have   no  jurisdiction   to  exercise\nthe   powers   under   the   said   Section.   Public\nemergency   would   mean   the   prevailing   of   a\nsudden   condition   or   state   of   affairs\naffecting   the   people   at   large   calling   for\nimmediate action.”\n\n244.   This   Court   issued   various   directions   providing\n\nfor   certain   safeguards   regarding   an   order   for\n\nTelephone­ tapping. Thus, on fulfillment of statutory\n\nconditions   when   telephonic   conversation   can   be\n\nintercepted   no   exception   can   be   taken   for   disclosure\n\nof information in the interest of national security.\n\n245.   The   power   given   under\nSection   33\nto   disclose\n\ninformation cannot be said to be disproportionate. The\n\ndisclosure   of   information   in   the   circumstances\nmentioned   in\nSection   33\nis   reasonable   and   in   the\n\npublic interest.\n\n246.   We   are   satisfied   that   the   provision   fulfills\n\nthree fold test as\nlaid down in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase. There\n\nare   no   grounds   to   declare\nSection   33\nas\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n247.   We also need to advert to one of the submissions\n\nof   the   petitioner   that   permitting   disclosure   of\n\ninformation   for   police   investigation   violates   the\n\nprotection   against   self­incrimination   as   provided\n\nunder\nArticle 20\nsub­clause (3). It is true that under\n\nSection   33\nthe   Court   may   order   for   disclosure   of\n\ninformation   even   for   a   police   investigation.   But\n\ninformation   so   received   in   no   manner   can   be   said   to\n\nviolate   the   protection   given   under\nArticle   20\nsub­\n\nclause   (3).   The   basic   information   which   are   with   the\n\nUIDAI   are     demographic   and   biometric   information.\nIn\n\nthis   context,   reference   is   made   to   11­Judge\n\nConstitution Bench judgment of this Court in\nState of\n\nBombay   vs.   Kathi   KALU   Oghad\n,   AIR   1961   SC   1808.  The\nConstitution Bench had occasion to consider sub­clause\n\n(3)   of\nArticle   20\nof   the   Constitution.   In\nthe   above\n\ncase\nfrom   the   accused   who   was   charged   under\nSection\n/\nIPC   during   the   investigation   prosecution   has\n\nobtained   three   specimen   of   hand­writing   which   were\n\ncompared   by   his   hand­writing   which   was   part   of   the\n\nevidence.   A   question   was   raised   as   to   the\n\nadmissibility of the specimen of hand­writing, it was\n\ncontended   that   use   of   specimen   of   hand­writing\n\nviolated protection under\nArticle 20(3).\nThis Court in\n\nparagraph 16 laid down following:\n\n(16)   In   view   of   these   considerations,   we\nhave come to the following conclusions :­\n(1) An accused person cannot be said\nto   have   been   compelled   to   be   a\nwitness   against   himself   simply\nbecause he made a statement while in\npolice   custody,   without   anything\nmore.   In   other   words,   the   mere   fact\nof   being   in   police   custody   at   the\ntime   when   the   statement   in   question\nwas made would not, by itself, as a\nproposition   of   law,   lend   itself   to\nthe   inference   that   the   accused   was\ncompelled   to   make   the   statement,\nthough that fact, in conjunction with\nother   circumstances   disclosed   in\nevidence in a particular case, would\nbe   a   relevant   consideration   in   an\nenquiry   whether   or   not   the   accused\nperson had been compelled to make the\nimpugned statement.\n\n(2)   The   mere   questioning   of   an\naccused   person   by   a   police   officer,\nresulting   in   a   voluntary   statement,\nwhich   may   ultimately   turn   out   to   be\nincriminatory, is not 'compulsion'.\n\n(3)   'To   be   a   witness'   is   not\nequivalent   to   'furnishing   evidence'\nin   its   widest   significance;   that   is\nto   say,   as   including   not   merely\nmaking of oral or written Dagduas but\nalso   production   of   documents   or\ngiving   materials   which   may   be\nrelevant at a trial to determine the\nguilt innocence of the accused.\n\n(4)   Giving   thumb   impressions   or\nimpressions   of   foot   or   palm   or\nfingers   or   specimen   writings   or\nshowing parts of the body by way of\nidentification   are   not   included   in\nthe expression 'to be a witness'.\n\n(5) 'To be a witness' means imparting\nknowledge   in   respect   of   relevant\nfacts   by   an   oral   statement   or   a\nstatement   in   writing,   made   or   given\nin Court or otherwise.\n\n(6) 'To be a witness' in its ordinary\ngrammatical   sense   means   giving   oral\ntestimony in Court. Case law has gone\nbeyond   this   strict   literal\ninterpretation   of   the   expression\nwhich   may   now   bear   a   wider   meaning,\nnamely, bearing testimony in Court or\nout of Court by a person accused of\nan offence, orally or in writing.\n\n(7)   To   bring   the   statement   in\nquestion   within   the   prohibition   of\nArticle   20(3)\n,   the   person   accused\nmust   have   stood   in   the   character   of\nan accused person at the time he made\nthe statement. It is not enough that\nhe should become an accused, any time\nafter the statement has been made.”\n\n248.  From what has been held\nin\nthe above case\n, it is\n\nclear   that   ‘to   be   a   witness'   is   not   equivalent   to\n\n'furnishing evidence' in its widest significance. The\n\nuse of information retained by the UIDAI given by the\n\norder of the Court under\nSection 33\ncannot be said to\n\nbe violating the protection as contained under\nArticle\n\n20(3).\nThus,\nArticle   20(3)\nis   not   violated   by\n\ndisclosure of information under\nSection 33\n. In view of\n\nthe   foregoing   discussion,   we   hold   that\nSection   33\nis\n\nconstitutional.\n\n249. One   of   the   decisions   on   which   Shri   K.V.\n\nViswanathan   has   placed   reliance   in   support   of   his\n\nsubmission   regarding   violation   of\nArticle   20(3)\nas\n\nwell   as\nArticle   21\nof   the   Constitution   is\nSelvi   and\n\nothers vs. State of Karnataka\n, 2010(7) SCC 263. In\nthe\n\nabove   case\nthis   Court   had   considered   as   to   whether\n\ncertain   scientific   techniques,   namely,   narcoanalysis,\npolygraph   examination   and   the   Brain   Electrical\n\nActivation   Profile   (BEAP)test   for   the   purpose   of\n\nimproving   investigation   efforts   in   criminal   cases\n\nviolate   sub­clause   (3)   of\nArticle   20\nas   well   as\n\nArticle 21.\nThe legal issues and questions of law have\n\nbeen noted in paragraphs 2 and 11     to the following\n\neffect:\n\n“2. The legal questions in this batch of\ncriminal   appeals   relate   to   the   involuntary\nadministration   of   certain   scientific\ntechniques,   namely   narcoanalysis,   polygraph\nexamination   and   the   Brain   Electrical\nActivation   Profile   (BEAP)   test   for   the\npurpose of improving investigation efforts in\ncriminal   cases.   This   issue   has   received\nconsiderable   attention   since   it   involves\ntensions   between   the   desirability   of\nefficient   investigation   and   the   preservation\nof   individual   liberties.   Ordinarily   the\njudicial task is that of evaluating the rival\ncontentions   in   order   to   arrive   at   a   sound\nconclusion. However, the present case is not\nan   ordinary  dispute  between  private  parties.\nIt   raises   pertinent   questions   about   the\nmeaning and scope of fundamental rights which\nare available to all citizens. Therefore, we\nmust   examine   the   implications   of   permitting\nthe   use   of   the   impugned   techniques   in   a\nvariety of settings.\n\n11. At this stage, it will be useful to\nframe   the   questions   of   law   and   outline   the\nrelevant   sub­questions   in   the   following\nmanner:\nI.Whether   the   involuntary\nadministration   of   the   impugned\ntechniques   violates   the   `right\nagainst   self­incrimination'\nenumerated   in\nArticle   20(3)\nof   the\nConstitution?\n\nI­A.   Whether   the   investigative\nuse   of   the   impugned   techniques\ncreates   a   likelihood   of\nincrimination for the subject?\n\nI­B.   Whether   the   results\nderived from the impugned techniques\namount   to   `testimonial   compulsion'\nthereby   attracting   the   bar   of\n\nArticle 20(3)?\n\nII.Whether   the   involuntary\nadministration   of   the   impugned\ntechniques   is   a   reasonable\nrestriction on `personal liberty' as\nunderstood in the context of\nArticle\nof the Constitution? ”\n\n250. After   considering   large   number   of   cases   of   this\n\nCourt as well as judgments rendered by Foreign Courts,\n\na conclusion was recorded that those tests, since they\n\nare   a   means   for   imparting   personal   knowledge   about\n\nrelevant   facts,   hence,   they   come   within   the   scope   of\n\ntestimonial   compulsion   thereby   attracting   the\n\nprotective   shield   of\nArticle   20(3).\nIn   paragraph   189\n\nfollowing was held:\n\n“189.   In   light   of   the   preceding\ndiscussion,   we   are   of   the   view   that   the\nresults obtained from tests such as polygraph\nexamination and the BEAP test should also be\ntreated   as   `personal   testimony',   since   they\nare a means for `imparting personal knowledge\nabout relevant facts'. Hence, our conclusion\nis   that   the   results   obtained   through   the\ninvoluntary   administration   of   either   of   the\nimpugned   tests   (i.e.   the   narcoanalysis\ntechnique, polygraph examination and the BEAP\ntest)   come   within   the   scope   of   `testimonial\ncompulsion',   thereby   attracting   the\nprotective shield of\nArticle 20(3).\n”\n\n251. In so far as question of violation of\nArticle 21\n\nis   concerned,   this   Court,   in   paragraphs   225   and   226\n\nhas held:\n\n“225. So far, the judicial understanding\nof privacy in our country has mostly stressed\non   the   protection   of   the   body   and   physical\nspaces   from   intrusive   actions   by   the   State.\nWhile   the   scheme   of   criminal   procedure   as\nwell   as   evidence   law   mandates   interference\nwith   physical   privacy   through   statutory\nprovisions   that   enable   arrest,   detention,\nsearch   and   seizure   among   others,   the   same\ncannot   be   the   basis   for   compelling   a   person\n`to   impart   personal   knowledge   about   a\nrelevant   fact'.   The   theory   of\ninterrelationship of rights mandates that the\nright   against   self­incrimination   should   also\nbe read as a component of `personal liberty'\nunder\nArticle 21.\nHence, our understanding of\nthe `right to privacy' should account for its\nintersection with\nArticle 20(3).\nFurthermore,\nthe `rule against involuntary confessions' as\nembodied in\nSections 24\n,\n,\nand\nof the\nEvidence   Act,   1872   seeks   to   serve   both   the\nobjectives   of   reliability   as   well   as\nvoluntariness   of   testimony   given   in   a\ncustodial   setting.   A   conjunctive   reading   of\n\nArticles   20(3)\nand\nof   the   Constitution\nalong   with   the   principles   of   evidence   law\nleads us to a clear answer. We must recognise\nthe   importance   of   personal   autonomy   in\naspects such as the choice between remaining\nsilent and speaking. An individual's decision\nto   make   a   statement   is   the   product   of   a\nprivate   choice   and   there   should   be   no   scope\nfor   any   other   individual   to   interfere   with\nsuch   autonomy,   especially   in   circumstances\nwhere   the   person   faces   exposure   to   criminal\ncharges or penalties.\n\n226.   Therefore,   it   is   our   considered\nopinion   that   subjecting   a   person   to   the\nimpugned   techniques  in   an   involuntary   manner\nviolates   the   prescribed   boundaries   of\nprivacy.   Forcible   interference   with   a\nperson's mental processes is not provided for\nunder any statute and it most certainly comes\ninto   conflict   with   the   `right   against   self­\nincrimination'.     However,   this determination\ndoes   not   account   for   circumstances   where   a\nperson   could   be   subjected   to   any   of   the\nimpugned   tests   but   not   exposed   to   criminal\ncharges and the possibility of conviction. In\nsuch   cases,   he/she   could   still   face   adverse\nconsequences   such   as   custodial   abuse,\nsurveillance,   undue   harassment   and   social\nstigma among others. In order to address such\ncircumstances,   it   is   important to   examine\nsome other dimensions of\nArticle 21.\n”\n\n252. The nature of tests which were under consideration\n\nin   the   aforesaid   case,   were   elaborately   noticed   by\n\nthis Court and the tests were found to be in nature of\nsubstantial   intrusion   in   the   body   and   mind   of   an\n\nindividual,   hence,   it   was   held   that   they   violate\n\nArticle 20(3)\nas well as\nArticle  21.\nIt is, however,\n\nrelevant to notice that this Court in    Selvi  judgment\n\nitself has noticed the distinction in so far as use of\n\nfingerprints   were   concerned.   This   Court   had   noticed\n\nearlier   judgment   of\nState   of   Bombay   v.   Kathi   Kalu\n\nOghad\n,   AIR   1961   SC   1808  with   approval.  The   biometric\n\ninformation that is fingerprints and iris scan can not\n\nbe   equated   to   the   tests   which   came   for   consideration\n\nin  Selvi's case.  Hence, the judgment of this Court in\n\nSelvi  does not in any manner support the case of the\n\npetitioners.   Answer   to   question   No.3   is   in   following\n\nManner:\n\nAns.9:\nSection   33\ncannot   be   said   to   be\n\nunconstitutional as it provides for the\n\nuse   of   Aadhaar   data   base   for   police\n\ninvestigation   nor   it   can   be     said   to\n\nviolate protection granted under\nArticle\n\n20(3).\nIssue No.10 Whether Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act is\nUnconstitutional?\n\n253.   The   Petitioner   submits   that   Section   47   of   the\n\nAadhaar   Act   is   unconstitutional   since   it   does   not\n\nallow   an   individual   who   is   victim   of   violation   of\n\nAadhaar   Act   to   initiate   a   criminal   process.   It   is\n\nsubmitted that the person who is victim of an offence\n\nunder   the   Aadhaar   Act   has   no   remedy   to   file   a\n\ncomplaint   and   Section   47   of   the   Act   restrict   the\n\nfiling of complaint only by Authorities or Officers or\n\npersons authorised by it.\n\n254. The above submission is refuted by the respondent\n\nthat\nSection   47\nhas   a   rationale.   The   offences   and\n\npenalties under Chapter VII of the Aadhaar Act are all\n\nintended to maintain the purity and integrity of CIDR\n\nand   the   entire   enrolment   storage   in   CIDR   and\n\nauthentication   exercise   can   only   be   efficiently   and\n\neffectively   handled   by   UIDAI.   Thus,   jurisdiction   to\n\nsubmit   a   complaint   has   been   conferred   to   UIDAI   which\n\nis   the   most   entrusted   entity   for   maintaining   the\npurity   of   Aadhaar   Scheme   and   is   also   affected   by\n\noffences   committed   under   the   Aadhaar   Act.\nSection   47\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n“47.   Cognizance   of   Offence   ­  (1)   No   court\nshall   take   cognizance   of   any   offence\npunishable   under   this   Act,   save   on   a\ncomplaint   made   by   the   Authority   or   any\nofficer or person authorised by it.\n\n(2)   No   court   inferior   to   that   of   a   Chief\nMetropolitan   Magistrate   or   a   Chief

Act   and   their   penalty   contains\n\nprovision   akin   to   Section   34   of   the   Aadhaar   Act.\n\nSpecial   Acts   are   enacted   for   serving   special   objects\n\ntowards   offences   under   the   Act.   The   initiation

 This Court in\nRajkumar Gupta versus Lt.Governor,\n\nDelhi   and   Others\n,   (1997)   1   SCC   556,  had   occasion   to\n\nconsider\nSection 34(1)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act,\n\n1947   and   objective   behind   putting   such   restriction.\n\nSection 34\nof Industrial Disputes Act provided that no\n\nCourt shall take cognizance of any offence punishable\n\nunder this Act or of the abetment of any such offence,\n\nsave   on   complaint   made   by   or   under   the   authority   of\n\nthe   appropriate Government.\nSection 34\nof Industrial\n\nDisputes   Act   is  pari   materia  with   Section   47   of   the\n\nAadhaar   Act.   This   Court   noticing   the   objective   of\n\nSection   34\nlaid   down   following   in   the   paragraph   16.\n\nThe   Court   held   that\nSection   34\nis   in   the   nature   of\n\nlimitation   on   the   entitlement   of   workman   or   trade\n\nunion or an employer to complain of offences under the\n\nAct.  Following was\nlaid down in\nparagraph 16:\n\n“  16.   At   the   same   time,   the   provisions   of\nSection 34\nare in the nature of a limitation\non   the   entitlement   of   a   workman   or   a

patently\nuntenable complaints, and to this end\nSection\nrequires that no complaint shall be taken\ncognizance   of   unless   it   is   made   with   the\nauthorization of the appropriate Government.”\n\n258.   In   so   far   as   the   submission   that   there   is   no\n\nforum for a person victim of an offence under Aadhaar\n\nAct, suffice to say that\nSection 47\ncan be invoked by\n\nthe authority on its own motion or when it receives a\n\ncomplaint from a victim. The authority i.e. UIDAI has\n\nvaried   powers   and   functions   as   enumerated   in\nSection\nof   the   Act.   It   is   the   authority   who   is   most\n\nentrusted   in   ensuring   that   the   provisions   of   the   Act\n\nare   implemented   in   accordance   with   the   Act   and\n\noffenders should be punished. In so far as remedy of\n\nvictim is concerned, there are few facts which need to\n\nbe kept in mind.\n\n259.\nThe   Information   Technology   Act,

which\nmay  extend  to  two  years, or  with  fine  which\nmay extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.”\n\n261.  With regard to an offence which falls within the\n\ndefinition   of   'offences'   a   victim   can   always   file\n\ncomplaint   or   lodge   an   F.I.R..   Section   46   of   the\n\nAadhaar Act clearly provides that the penalties under\n\nthe   Aadhaar   Act   shall   not   interfere   with   other\n\npunishments.\nSection 46\nis as follows:\n\n“46.   Penalties   not   to   interfere   with   other\npunishments. ­  No penalty imposed under this\nAct shall prevent the imposition of any other\npenalty or punishment under any other law for\nthe time being in force.”\n\n262.    This   Court   in\nState   (NCT   of

Minerals\n\n(Development & Regulations) Act, 1957 which provision\n\nis   similar   to   Section   47   of   the   Aadhaar   Act.  The\n\nquestion arose that whether in case the complaint has\n\nnot   been   filed   by   the   authority   under\nSection   22\n,\n\nwhether cognizance can be taken of the offence if it\n\nfalls   within   definition   of   any   of   the   offences   under\n\nthe\nIndian   Penal   Code\n.  There   was   divergence   of\n\nopinions between the different High Courts. This Court\n\nafter   noticing   earlier   judgments   of   this   Court,   laid\n\ndown following in paragraphs 17 and 73.\n\n“17.  Since conflicting views have been taken\nby   the   Gujarat   High   Court,   the   Delhi   High\nCourt,   the   Kerala   High   Court,   the   Calcutta\nHigh   Court,   the   Madras   High   Court   and   the\nJharkhand   High   Court,   and   they   are   in\ndifferent   tones,   it   is   necessary   to

the\nCode   of\nCriminal Procedure\nand the Penal Code, we are\nof the definite opinion that the ingredients\nconstituting   the   offence   under   the\nMMDR   Act\n\nand   the   ingredients   of   dishonestly   removing\nsand   and   gravel   from   the   riverbeds   without\nconsent, which is the property of the State,\nis   a   distinct   offence   under\nIPC\n.   Hence,   for\nthe   commission   of   offence   Under\nSection   378\n\nIPC,   on   receipt   of   the   police   report,   the\nMagistrate   having   jurisdiction   can   take\ncognizance   of   the   said   offence   without\nawaiting the receipt of complaint that may be\nfiled   by   the   authorized   officer   for   taking\ncognizance in respect of violation of various\nprovisions of the\nMMDR Act\n. Consequently the\ncontrary   view   taken   by   the   different   High\nCourts   cannot   be   sustained   in   law   and,\ntherefore,   overruled.   Consequently,   these\ncriminal   appeals   are   disposed   of   with   a\ndirection   to   the   Magistrates   concerned   to\nproceed accordingly. ”\n\n263.   The   limitation   as   contained   in\nSection   47\nin\n\npermitting taking cognizance of any offence punishable\n\nunder   Aadhaar   Act   only   on   a   complaint   made   by   the\n\nauthority   or   any   officer   or   person   authorised   by   it,\n\nhas   legislative   purpose   and   objective,   as   noticed\n\nabove. We thus do not find any unconstitutionality in\n\nSection   47   of   the   Aadhaar   Act.   In   view   of   the\n\nforegoing discussions, the answer to Issue No.10 is in\n\nfollowing manner:­\n\nAns.10: Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act cannot be held\nto be  unconstitutional   on   the   ground   that\nit does not  allow   an   individual   who   finds\nthat there is a  violation of Aadhaar Act to\ninitiate any criminal  process.\nIssue No. 11 Whether Section 57 of Aadhaar Act is\nunconstitutional?\n\n264.\nSection 57\nof the Act, which contains a heading\n\n“Act   not   to   prevent   use   of   Aadhaar   Number   for   other\n\npurposes under law” provides:­\n\n“57. Act to prevent use of Aadhaar number for\nother purposes under law. ­ Nothing contained\nin this Act shall prevent the use of Aadhaar\nnumber   for   establishing   the   identity   of   an\nindividual   for   any   purpose,   whether   by   the\nState   or   any   body   corporate   or   person,\npursuant   to   any   law,   for   the   time   being   in\nforce, or any contract to this effect:\n\nProvided   that   the   use   of   Aadhaar   number\nunder   this   section   shall   be   subject   to   the\nprocedure and obligations under\nsection 8\nand\nChapter VI.”\n\n265. Attacking the provision of\nSection 57\n, petitioners\n\ncontends that broad and unlimited scope of activities\n\ncovered under\nSection 57\nand kinds of private entities\n\npermitted to use Aadhaar is entirely disproportionate\n\nbeyond the means and objectives of the Act and without\n\nany   compelling   State   interests.     There   are   no\n\nprocedural safeguards governing the actions of private\n\nentities   and   no   remedy   for   undertaking's   failure   or\n\nservice denial. The individual, who wish to be\nenrolled   have   given   their   consent   only   for   Aadhaar\n\nsubsidies,   benefits   and   services,   which   cannot   be\n\nassumed   for   other   purposes.\nSection   57\nhas   to   be\n\nstruck   down   on   the   ground   of   excessive   delegation.\n\n“Any   purpose”   indicates   absence   of   guidelines.     Any\n\npurpose does not mean all purposes and several aspects\n\nof human existence.\nSection 57\nviolates all principles\n\nof proportionality.\n\n266.  Refuting the above submission of the petitioners,\n\nthe   respondents   submits   that,\nSection   57\nis   not   an\n\nenabling   provision,   it   merely   provides   as   it   states\n\nthat the  provisions of the  Act would not  prevent the\n\nuse of Aadhaar  for other purposes.   In fact,\nSection\nemploys limitation on such user for other purposes,\n\nwhich is engrafted in Proviso to\nSection 59\n.   The use\n\nof   Aadhaar   having   been   made   subject   to   procedure   and\n\nobligations   under\nSection   8\nand   Chapter   VI,   the\n\ncontract must provide for authentication under\nSection\nand protection and formulation under Chapter VI also\n\nobviously   entail   the   operation   of   Chapter   VII\n\n(Offences   and   Penalties).\nSection   57\ndoes   not   have\nany   relation   to   other   laws,   which   may   be   made   by\n\nParliament,   the   other   laws   made   by   Parliament   would\n\nhave to be tested on their own merits.\nSection 57\nis\n\nnot   a   provision   enabling   the   making   of   a   law   or\n\nrather   it   is   actually   a   limitation   or   restriction   to\n\nlaw, which may be made with respect to use of Aadhaar\n\nnumber.  The apprehension expressed by the petitioners\n\nis   about   the   wide   extension   of   use   of   Aadhaar   in\n\nprivate spheres is completely misplaced.\n\n267.   One of the grounds of attack of the petitioners\n\nto\nSection 57\nis that it is disproportionate and does\n\nnot   satisfy   the   proportionality   test   as\nlaid   down   in\n\nPrivacy Judgment –\nPuttaswamy\ncase.   Before proceeding\n\nfurther,   it   becomes   necessary   to   look   into   the\n\nproportionality test, its content and parameters.\n\n268.   Patanjali Shastri, Chief Justice,  as he then was\n\nspeaking   for   a   Constitution   Bench   in\nState   of   Madras\n\nVs. V.G.  Row\n, AIR 1952  SC 196,  while  elaborating the\n\nexpression reasonable restrictions on the exercise of\n\nright as occurring in Clause (5) of\nArticle 19\nof the\nConstitution   laid   down   that   reasonable   restriction\n\nshould not be disproportionate. Following was observed\n\nin Paragraph 15:­\n\n“15........It is important in this context to\nbear in mind that the test of reasonableness,\nwherever   prescribed,   should   be applied   to\neach   individual   statute   impugned,   and   no\nabstract   standard   or   general   pattern,   of\nreasonableness can be laid down as applicable\nto all cases. The nature of the right alleged\nto   have   been   infringed,   the   underlying\npurpose   of   the   restrictions   imposed,   the\nextent   and  urgency   of  the  evil  sought  to   be\nremedied   thereby,   the   disproportion   of   the\nimposition,  the  prevailing   conditions   at   the\ntime,   should   all   enter   into   the   judicial\nverdict.   In   evaluating   such   elusive   factors\nand   forming   their   own   conception   of   what   is\nreasonable,   in   all   the   circumstances   of   a\ngiven case, it is inevitable that the social\nphilosophy   and   the   scale   of   values   of   the\nJudges   participating   in   the   decision   should\nplay   an   important   part,   and   the   limit   to\ntheir   interference   with   legislative   judgment\nin   such  cases  can  only   be  dictated   by  their\nsense   of   responsibility   and   self­restraint\nand   the   sobering   reflection   that   the\nConstitution is meant not only for people of\ntheir  way  of  thinking  but  for  all,   and  that\nthe   majority   of   the   elected   representatives\nof   the   people   have,   in   authorising   the\nimposition   of   the   restrictions,   considered\nthem to be reasonable.”\n\n269.   A Two Judge Bench of this Court in\nOm Kumar and\n\nOthers   Vs.   Union   of   India\n,   (2001)   2   SCC   386\nelaborately   considered   the   concept   of   proportionality\n\nin   reference   to   legislative   action.\nThis   Court   held\n\nthat   ever   since   the   principle   of   proportionality   as\n\nnoted above applied in India, Jagannadha Rao,   J. had\n\nreferred   to   judgments   of   Canadian   Supreme   Court   in  R\n\nv. Oakes (1986) 26 DLR 2001  and has noticed the three\n\nimportant   components   of   the   proportionality   test.\n\nFirst, the measures adopted must be carefully designed\n\nto achieve the objective in question. They must not be\n\narbitrary,   unfair   or   based   on   irrational\n\nconsiderations.   In   short,   they   must   be   rationally\n\nconnected to the objective. Secondly, the means, must\n\nnot   only   be   rationally   connected   to   the   objective   in\n\nthe   first   sense,   but   should   impair   as   little   as\n\npossible   the   right   to   freedom   in   question.   Thirdly,\n\nthere must be 'proportionality' between the effects of\n\nthe measures and the objective.\n\n270.   Again,   in\nTeri   Oat   Estates   (P)   Ltd.   Vs.   U.T.\n\nChandigarh and Others\n, (2004) 2 SCC 130, Sinha, J. had\n\nelaborately reviewed the principle of proportionality.\n\nIn Paragraph 46, following has been held:­\n“46. By proportionality, it is meant that the\nquestion whether while regulating exercise of\nfundamental  rights,  the  appropriate  or   least\nrestrictive choice of measures has been made\nby the legislature or the administrator so as\nto   achieve   the   object   of   the   legislation   or\nthe   purpose   of   the   administrative   order,   as\nthe   case   may   be.   Under   the   principle,   the\ncourt   will   see   that   the   legislature   and   the\nadministrative authority\n“maintain   a  proper   balance   between\nthe   adverse   effects   which   the\nlegislation   or   the   administrative\norder   may   have   on   the   rights,\nliberties   or   interests   of   persons\nkeeping   in   mind   the   purpose   which\nthey were intended to serve”.\n\n271.   The most elaborate consideration of the Doctrine\n\nof   Proportionality   was   made   in\nModern   Dental   College\n\nand   Research   Centre   and   Others   Vs.   State   of   Madhya\n\nPradesh and Others\n, (2016) 7 SCC 353.  The validity of\n\nlegislation   passed   by   State   of   Madhya   Pradesh\n\nLegislature   came   for   consideration.     The   Court\n\n(speaking   through   Dr.   Justice   A.K.   Sikri,   one   of   us)\n\nheld   that   exercise   that   is   required   to   be   undertaken\n\nis   the     balancing   of   fundamental   right   and\n\nrestrictions   imposed,   which   is   known   as   Doctrine   of\n\nProportionality.   In Paragraph 60, following has been\nstated:­\n\n“60.  ….........  Thus,   while   examining   as   to\nwhether   the   impugned   provisions   of   the\nstatute   and   rules   amount   to   reasonable\nrestrictions   and   are   brought   out   in   the\ninterest of the general public, the exercise\nthat   is   required   to   be   undertaken   is   the\nbalancing   of   fundamental   right   to   carry   on\noccupation   on   the   one   hand   and   the\nrestrictions imposed on the other hand. This\nis   what   is   known   as   “doctrine   of\nproportionality”.   Jurisprudentially,\n“proportionality”   can   be   defined   as   the   set\nof   rules   determining   the   necessary   and\nsufficient   conditions   for   limitation   of   a\nconstitutionally protected right by a law to\nbe constitutionally permissible.\nAccording to\nAharon   Barak   (former   Chief   Justice,   Supreme\nCourt   of   Israel),   there   are   four   sub­\ncomponents   of   proportionality   which   need   to\nbe   satisfied,   a   limitation   of   a\nconstitutional right will be constitutionally\npermissible if:\n\n(i)   it   is   designated   for   a   proper\npurpose;\n\n(ii)   the   measures   undertaken   to\neffectuate   such   a   limitation   are\nrationally   connected   to   the\nfulfilment of that purpose;\n\n(iii)   the   measures   undertaken   are\nnecessary   in   that   there   are   no\nalternative   measures   that   may\nsimilarly   achieve   that   same   purpose\nwith a lesser degree of limitation;\n\nand finally\n\n(iv)   there   needs   to   be   a   proper\nrelation   (“proportionality   stricto\nsensu”   or   “balancing”)   between   the\nimportance   of   achieving   the   proper\npurpose and the social importance of\npreventing   the   limitation   on   the\nconstitutional right.”\n\n272.  Elaborating the constitutional principles, it was\n\nlaid down that the Constitution permit constitutional\n\nrights   to   be   limited   to   protect   public   interests   or\n\nthe   rights   of   others.   The   conflict   between   two\n\nfundamental   aspects,   i.e.   rights   on   the   one   hand   and\n\nits limitation on the other hand ­ is to be resolved\n\nby   balancing   the   two   so   that   they   harmoniously   co­\n\nexist   with   each   other.   This   balancing   is   to   be   done\n\nkeeping   in   mind   the   relative social   values   of   each\n\ncompetitive aspects when considered in proper context.\n\nWhat   criteria   is   to   be   adopted   in   for   a   proper\n\nbalancing has been explained in Paragraphs 63 and 64:­\n\n“63.   In   this   direction,   the   next   question\nthat arises is as to what criteria is to be\nadopted for a proper balance between the two\nfacets   viz.   the   rights   and   limitations\nimposed upon it by a statute. Here comes the\nconcept   of   “proportionality”,   which   is   a\nproper   criterion.   To   put   it   pithily,   when   a\nlaw   limits   a   constitutional   right,   such   a\nlimitation   is   constitutional   if   it   is\nproportional.   The   law   imposing   restrictions\nwill   be   treated   as   proportional   if   it   is\nmeant to achieve a proper purpose, and if the\nmeasures taken to achieve such a purpose are\nrationally connected to the purpose, and such\nmeasures   are   necessary.   This   essence   of\ndoctrine   of   proportionality   is   beautifully\ncaptured by Dickson, C.J. of Canada in R. v.\n\nOakees,   (1986)   1   SCR   103   (Can   SC),   in   the\nfollowing words (at p. 138):\n\n“To   establish   that   a   limit   is\nreasonable and demonstrably justified\nin a free and democratic society, two\ncentral   criteria   must   be   satisfied.\n\nFirst,   the   objective,   which   the\nmeasures, responsible for a limit on\na   Charter   right   or   freedom   are\ndesigned   to   serve,   must   be   “of”\nsufficient   importance   to   warrant\noverriding a constitutional protected\nright or freedom … Second … the party\ninvoking\nSection 1\nmust show that the\nmeans   chosen   are   reasonable   and\ndemonstrably justified. This involves\n“a   form   of   proportionality   test…”\nAlthough   the   nature   of   the\nproportionality   test   will   vary\ndepending   on   the   circumstances,   in\neach case courts will be required to\nbalance the interests of society with\nthose   of   individuals   and   groups.\n\nThere   are,   in   my   view,   three\nimportant   components   of   a\nproportionality   test.   First,   the\nmeasures adopted must be … rationally\nconnected   to   the   objective.   Second,\nthe means … should impair “as little\nas possible” the right or freedom in\nquestion   …   Third,   there   must   be   a\nproportionality   between   the   effects\nof the measures which are responsible\nfor   limiting   the   Charter   right   or\nfreedom, and the objective which has\nbeen   identified   as   of   “sufficient\nimportance”.   The   more   severe   the\ndeleterious effects of a measure, the\nmore important the objective must be\nif   the   measure   is   to   be   reasonable\nand demonstrably justified in a free\nand democratic society.”\n\n64.   The   exercise   which,   therefore,   is   to   be\ntaken   is   to   find   out   as   to   whether   the\nlimitation of constitutional rights is for a\npurpose that is reasonable and necessary in a\ndemocratic   society   and   such   an   exercise\ninvolves   the   weighing   up   of   competitive\nvalues, and ultimately an assessment based on\nproportionality   i.e.   balancing   of   different\ninterests.”\n\n273.   The   application   of   Doctrine   of   Proportionality,\n\nwhile   examining   validity   of   the   Statute   has   been\n\naccepted in other countries as well. Judgments of the\n\nU.S.   Supreme   Court   as   well   as   of   United   Kingdom,\n\nCanadian Supreme Court and Australian Court shows that\n\nthey   have   applied   proportionality   principle   while\n\njudging a Statute.  European Court of Human Rights and\n\nother   international   bodies   have   recognised   the   said\n\nprinciple.     Privacy   judgment   in\nPuttaswamy\ncase  has\n\nalso accepted the proportionality doctrine for judging\n\nvalidity of a Statute.  In the three­fold test evolved\n\nin   Privacy   Judgment,   proportionality   is   the   third\ncomponent.   Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. in Paragraph 310\n\nhas stated following in respect of proportionality:­\n\n“310.   While   it   intervenes   to   protect\nlegitimate   State   interests,   the   State   must\nnevertheless   put   into   place   a   robust   regime\nthat   ensures   the   fulfilment   of   a   threefold\nrequirement.   These   three   requirements   apply\nto   all   restraints   on   privacy   (not   just\ninformational privacy). They emanate from the\nprocedural   and   content­based   mandate   of\n\nArticle 21.\nThe first requirement that there\nmust   be   a   law   in   existence   to   justify   an\nencroachment   on   privacy   is   an   express\nrequirement of\nArticle 21.\nFor, no person can\nbe   deprived   of   his   life   or   personal   liberty\nexcept   in   accordance   with   the   procedure\nestablished   by   law.   The   existence   of   law   is\nan   essential   requirement.   Second,   the\nrequirement   of   a   need,   in   terms   of   a\nlegitimate State aim, ensures that the nature\nand   content   of   the   law   which   imposes   the\nrestriction   falls   within   the   zone   of\nreasonableness   mandated  by\nArticle   14\n,   which\nis   a   guarantee   against   arbitrary   State\naction. The pursuit of a legitimate State aim\nensures   that   the   law   does   not   suffer   from\nmanifest   arbitrariness.   Legitimacy,   as   a\npostulate,   involves   a   value   judgment.\n\nJudicial   review   does   not   reappreciate   or\nsecond   guess   the   value   judgment   of   the\nlegislature   but   is   for   deciding   whether   the\naim   which   is   sought   to   be   pursued   suffers\nfrom   palpable   or   manifest   arbitrariness.   The\nthird   requirement   ensures   that   the   means\nwhich   are adopted   by   the   legislature   are\nproportional   to   the   object   and   needs   sought\nto   be   fulfilled   by   the   law.   Proportionality\nis   an   essential   facet   of   the   guarantee\nagainst   arbitrary   State   action because   it\nensures   that   the   nature   and   quality   of   the\nencroachment   on   the   right   is   not\ndisproportionate   to   the   purpose   of   the   law.\n\nHence, the threefold requirement for a valid\nlaw arises out of the mutual interdependence\nbetween   the   fundamental   guarantees   against\narbitrariness   on   the   one   hand   and   the\nprotection   of   life   and   personal   liberty,   on\nthe other. The right to privacy, which is an\nintrinsic   part   of   the   right   to   life   and\nliberty,   and   the   freedoms   embodied   in   Part\nIII   is   subject   to   the   same   restraints   which\napply to those freedoms.”\n\n274.   The   third   requirement   ensures   that   the   means\n\nwhich are adopted by the legislature are proportional\n\nto the object and needs sought to be fulfilled by the\n\nlaw.   Proportionality   is   an   essential   facet   of   the\n\nguarantee   against   arbitrary   state   action   because   it\n\nensures   that   the   nature   and   quality   of   the\n\nencroachment   on   the   right   is   not   disproportionate   to\n\nthe purpose of the law.\n\n275.   European Court of Justice in  Michael Schwarz Vs.\n\nStadt   Bochum  in   its   judgment   dated   17.10.2013,   while\n\nconsidering a directive of the European Parliament and\n\non   the   protection   of   individuals   with   regard   to   the\n\nprocessing   of   personal   data   and   on   the   free   movement\n\nof   such   data,   has   applied   the   proportionality\nprinciple.  Following was laid down in Paragraph 40:­\n\n“40.     Fourth,   the   Court   must   establish\nwhether   the   limitations   placed   on   those\nrights are proportionate to the aims pursued\nby   Regulation   No.   2252/2004   and,   by\nextension,   to   the   objective   of   preventing\nillegal   entry   into   the   European   Union.     It\nmust   therefore   be   ascertained   whether   the\nmeasures   implemented   by   that   regulation   are\nappropriate   for   attaining   those   aims   and   do\nnot   go   beyond   what   is   necessary   to   achieve\nthem   (see Volker   and   Markus   Schedule   and\nEifert, paragraph 74).”\n\n276.  Court of Justice of the European Union in Digital\n\nRights   Ireland   Ltd.   Vs.   Minister   for   Communications\n\n[2015] QBECJ 127 had occasion to consider the validity\n\nof Parliament and Council Directive 2006/24/EC on the\n\nretention   of   data   generated   or   processed   by   them   in\n\nconnection   with   the   provision   of   publicly   available\n\nelectronic   communications   services   or   of   public\n\ncommunications   networks.     Applying   the   principle   of\n\nproportionality,   it   was   held   that   principle   of\n\nproportionality   requires   that   acts   of   the   EU\n\ninstitutions   be   appropriate   for   attaining   the\n\nlegitimate   objectives   pursued   by   the   legislation   at\n\nissue   and   do   not   exceed   the   limits   of   what   is\nappropriate   and   necessary   in   order   to   achieve   those\n\nobjectives.  Following was laid down in Paragraph 46:\n\n“46.   In   summary,   Directive   2006/24   is\ncharacterised   by   its   functional   duality.   It\nis, on the one hand, an entirely traditional\nDirective   which   seeks   to   harmonise   national\nlaws   that   are   disparate   (recital   (5)   in   the\nPreamble   to   Directive   2006/24   states   that\nnational   laws   ”vary  considerably”)   or   likely\nto   become   so,   and   was   adopted   in   the\ninterests of the functioning of the internal\nmarket   and   precisely   calibrated   for   that\npurpose,   as   the   court   ruled   in  Ireland   v\nEuropean Parliament. However, it is also, on\nthe   other   hand,   a   Directive   which,   even   in\nits  harmonising  function,   seeks  to   establish\nwhere appropriate, obligations­ in particular\ndata retention obligations­ which constitute,\nas   I   shall   show   later,   serious   interference\nwith the enjoyment of the fundamental rights\nguaranteed   to   European   citizens   by   the\nCharter,   in   particular   the   right   to   privacy\nand   the   right   to   the   protection   of   personal\ndata.”\n\n277.   Another   judgment   by   Court   of   the   Justice   of\n\nEuropean Union (Grand Chamber) is Tele2 Sverige AB Vs.\n\nPost­och   telesyrelsen.  A   directive   of   European\n\nParliament   and   of   the   Council   concerning   the\n\nprocessing   of   personal   data   and   the   protection   of\n\nprivacy   in   the   electronic   communications   sector   came\n\nfor consideration.   In Paras 95, 96 and 116 following\nwas laid down:­\n\n“95.     With   respect   to   that   last   issue,   the\nfirst sentence of\nArticle 15(1)\nof Directive\n2002/58 provides that Member States may adopt\na   measure   that   derogates   from   the   principle\nof   confidentiality   of   communications   and\nrelated   traffic   data   where   it   is   a\n‘necessary,   appropriate   and   proportionate\nmeasure within a democratic society’, in view\nof   the   objectives   laid   down   in   that\nprovision.   As   regards   recital   11   of   that\ndirective,   it   states   that   a   measure   of   that\nkind must be ‘strictly’ proportionate to the\nintended   purpose.   In   relation   to,   in\nparticular,   the   retention   of   data,   the\nrequirement laid down in the second sentence\nof\nArticle   15(1)\nof   that   directive   is   that\ndata   should   be   retained   ‘for   a   limited\nperiod’   and   be   ‘justified’   by   reference   to\none   of   the   objectives   stated   in   the   first\nsentence of\nArticle 15(1)\nof that directive.\n\n96.     Due   regard   to   the   principle   of\nproportionality also derives from the Court’s\nsettled   case­law   to   the   effect   that   the\nprotection   of   the   fundamental   right   to\nrespect for private life at EU level requires\nthat derogations from and limitations on the\nprotection of personal data should apply only\nin so far as is strictly necessary (judgments\nof   16   December   2008,   Satakunnan\nMarkkinapörssi   and   Satamedia,  C­\n73/07,EU:C:2008:727,paragraph  56;   of   9\nNovember 2010, Volker und Markus Schecke and\nEifert,  C­92/09   and   C­93/09,

with   the\nprinciple   of   proportionality,   national\nlegislation   governing   the   conditions   under\nwhich   the   providers   of   electronic\ncommunications   services   must   grant   the\ncompetent national  authorities access to  the\nretained data must ensure, in accordance with\nwhat   was   stated   in   paragraphs   95   and   96   of\nthis   judgment,   that   such   access   does   not\nexceed   the   limits   of   what   is   strictly\nnecessary.”\n\n278.  The U.S. Supreme Court while considering the said\n\ntest   has   repeatedly   refused   to   apply   the   least\n\nintrusive   test.    Vernonia   School   District   Vs.   Wayne\n\nActon, 515 US 646, 132 L.Ed. 2D 564, was a case where\n\na   Student   Athlete   Drug   Policy   was   adopted   by   the\n\nSchool   District,   which   authorised   random   urine\n\nanalysis drug testing of students participating in the\n\nDistrict   School   Athletic   Programme.     A   student   was\n\ndenied participation in Football game since he and his\n\nparents had refused to sign the testing consent forms.\n\nThe   Actons   filed   suit,   seeking   for   a   declaratory   and\n\ninjunctive relief from enforcement of the Policy.  One\n\nof   the   submissions   raised   was   that   Policy   is\n\ndisproportionate   since   it   asks   all   the   athletes   to\n\nundergo   urine   analysis,   the   test   is   not   least\n\nintrusive   test.     Repelling   the   least   intrusive   test,\nfollowing was held:­\n\n“As   to   the   efficacy   of   this   means   for\naddressing the problem: It seems to us self­\nevident that a drug problem largely fueled by\nthe   \"role   model\"   effect   of   athletes'   drug\nuse, and of particular danger to athletes, is\neffectively   addressed   by   making   sure   that\nathletes do not use drugs. Respondents argue\nthat a \"less intrusive means to the same end\"\n\nwas   available,   namely,   \"drug   testing   on\nsuspicion of drug use.\" Brief for Respondents\n45­46. We have repeatedly refused to declare\nthat   only   the   \"least   intrusive\"   search\npracticable   can   be   reasonable   under   the\nFourth   Amendment.   Skinner,   supra,   at   629,\nn.9,   103   l   Ed   2d   639,   109   S   Ct.   1402\n(collecting cases).\n\n279.   To   the   same   effect   is   another   judgment   of   U.S.\n\nSupreme   Court   in  Board   of   Education   of   Independent\n\nSchool   District   Vs.   Lindsay   Earls,   536   US   822=153\n\nL.Ed.2d. 735.\n\n280.   The   submission   of   the   respondents   that   least\n\nintrusive   test   cannot   be   applied   to   judge   the\n\nproportionality   of   Aadhaar   Act   has   been   refuted   by\n\npetitioners.   Petitioners submit that least intrusive\n\ntest is a test, which was applied in large number of\n\ncases and i.e. the test which may ensure that there is\n\na minimal invasion  of privacy.   It  is submitted that\nthe   respondents   could   have   switched   to   a   smart   card,\n\nwhich   itself   contain   the   biometric   information   of   a\n\nperson.     Respondents   submitted   that   least   intrusive\n\ntest has not been approved either in the\nModern Dental\n\n(supra) or in the\nPuttaswamy\ncase.  We are also of the\n\nview that there are several reasons due to which least\n\nintrusive   test   cannot   be   insisted.     For   applying   the\n\nleast   intrusive   test,   the   Court   has   to   enter\n\ncomparative analysis of all methods of identification\n\navailable,   which   need   to   be   examined   with   their\n\ndetails   and   compared.   Court   has   to   arrive   at   finding\n\nas to which mode of identity is a least intrusive.  We\n\nare   of   the   view   that   comparison   of   several   modes   of\n\nidentity   and   to   come   to   a   decision,   which   is   least\n\nintrusive is a matter, which may be better left to the\n\nexperts   to   examine.     Further,   there   are   no   proper\n\npleadings   and   material   with   regard   to   other   modes   of\n\nidentification,   which   could   have   been   adopted   by   the\n\nState, to come to a definite conclusion by this Court.\n\n281. After noticing the parameters of proportionality,\n\nwe   now   need   to   apply   proportionality   and   other   tests\nto   find   out   as   to   whether\nSection   57\nsatisfies   the\n\nproportionality and   other   tests.\nSection   57\nbegins\n\nwith   the   phrase   “nothing   contained   in   this   Act   shall\n\nprevent   the   use   of   Aadhaar   number.....”   for\n\nestablishing   the   identity   of   an   individual   for   any\n\npurpose.\nSection   57\nreveals   following   concepts   and\n\nides, which can be para phrased in following manner:­\n\n(a) Nothing   contained   in   this   Act   shall\n\nprevent   the   use   of   Aadhaar   number   for\n\nidentifying the identity of an individual\n\nfor any purpose.\n\n(b) Whether by the State or body corporate or\n\nprivate person.\n\n(c) Pursuant   to   any   law,   for   the   time   being\n\nin force or any contract to this effect.\n\n282.   The basic theme of the Aadhaar Act to implement\n\nthe Aadhaar programme was for purposes of disbursement\n\nof   subsidies,   benefits   or   services   to   individuals\n\nentitled   for   the   same.     By   various   notifications\n\nissued   under\nSection   7\n,   the   Government   has   made\n\napplicable Aadhaar authentication for large number of\nschemes namely 133 in number.  The idea behind\nSection\nis that Aadhaar is liberated from the four corners\n\nof   the   Act   and   it   may   not   be   confined   to   use   under\n\nSection 7\nalone.\nThe Act\ndoes not prohibit the use of\n\nAadhaar for any other purpose.\nSection 57\nis thus in\n\na way clarificatory in nature, which enable the use of\n\nAadhaar for any other purposes.   The petitioners have\n\ntwo   basic   objections.     Firstly,   they   submitted   that\n\nuse of word “any purpose” is unguided and uncontrolled\n\nand   secondly   it   can   be   used   by   body   corporate   or\n\npersons,   pursuant   to   any   law,   for   the   time   being   in\n\nforce   or   any   contract   to   this   effect.    Puttaswamy\n\njudgment   has   already   laid   down   that   any   infringement\n\nof   Privacy   right   should   pass   three­fold   test   as\n\nnoticed   above.     The   first   test,   which   needs   to   be\n\nsatisfied   for   non­intrusion   in   privacy   right   is   that\n\nit   should   be   backed   by   law.\nSection   57\ncannot   be\n\ntreated as a law, which permit use  of Aadhaar number\n\nfor any purpose.  The law providing for use of Aadhaar\n\nfor   any   purpose   should   be   rational   and   proportional.\n\nThere has to be some object to be achieved by use of\nAadhaar,   in   a   particular   case,   the   legislature   has\n\nample   power   to   provide   for   legislative   scheme   by   an\n\nenactment making use of Aadhaar and use of Aadhaar has\n\nto be backed by a valid law.  In event, it is accepted\n\non   the   strength   of\nSection   57\nthat   a   State   or   body\n\ncorporate or  person, on the basis of any  contract to\n\nthis effect, are permitted to use Aadhaar it shall be\n\nwholly   unguided   and   uncontrolled,   which   is   prone   to\n\nviolate the right of privacy.\nSection 57\nmakes use of\n\nAadhaar on two basis.   Firstly, “pursuant to any law,\n\nfor   the   time   being   in   force”   and   secondly   “any\n\ncontract   to   this   effect”.     When   the   legislature   uses\n\nthe phrase “pursuant to any law, for the time being in\n\nforce”, obviously the word law used in\nSection 57\nis a\n\nlaw other than\nSection 57\nof Aadhaar Act, 2016 and the\n\nRegulations   framed   thereunder.     When   any   law   permits\n\nuser of Aadhaar, its validity is to be tested on the\n\nanvil of  three­fold test  as\nlaid  down in\n\nPuttaswamy\n\ncase, but permitting use of Aadhaar on any contract to\n\nthis   effect,   is   clearly   in   violation   of   Right   of\n\nPrivacy.  A contract entered between two parties, even\nif one party is a State, cannot be said to be a law.\n\n283.   We thus, are of the view that\nSection 57\nin so\n\nfar as it permits use of Aadhaar on “any contract to\n\nthis effect” is clearly unconstitutional and deserves\n\nto be struck down.   We may again clarify that\nSection\nhas to be read only to mean that it clarifies that\n\nnothing contained in Aadhaar Act shall prevent the use\n\nof   Aadhaar   for   establishing   the   identity   of   an\n\nindividual   for   any   purpose,   in   pursuant   to   any law.\n\nSection 57\nitself is not a law, which may permit use\n\nof Aadhaar for any purpose.   There has to be a valid\n\nlaw   in   existence,   which   should   also   pass   the   three­\n\nfold test as\nlaid down  in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase for making\n\nprovision for use of Aadhaar.\n\n284.   In   view   of   the   foregoing   discussions,   we   held\n\nthat\nSection 57\n, to the extent, which permits use of\n\nAadhaar by the State or any body corporate or person,\n\nin   pursuant   to   any   contract   to   this   effect   is\n\nunconstitutional   and   void.     Thus,   the   last   phrase   in\n\nmain provision of\nSection 57\n, i.e. “or any contract to\nthis effect” is struck down.  Issue No. 11 is answered\n\nin the following manner:­\n\nAns.11:­\nSection 57\n, to the extent, which permits use\n\nof   Aadhaar   by   the   State   or   any   body\n\ncorporate   or   person,   in   pursuant   to   any\n\ncontract to this effect is unconstitutional\n\nand   void.     Thus,   the   last   phrase   in   main\n\nprovision   of\nSection   57\n,   i.e.   “or   any\n\ncontract to this effect” is struck down.\n\nIssue No.12 Whether\nSection   59\nis   void   or\nunconstitutional?\n\n285.   Learned   counsel   for   the   petitioners   have\n\nsubmitted that prior to enactment of Aadhaar Act there\n\nwas no law and all actions undertaken in pursuance of\n\nthe executive order dated 28.01.2009 including taking\n\nof   demographic   and   biometric   information   of   an\n\nindividual   was   not   backed   by   any   law   violated\n\nfundamental right of privacy. Violation of fundamental\n\nright   of   privacy   cannot   be   cured   by   any   subsequent\n\nlegislation.   It   is   well   settled   that   Executive\nactions,   which   breach   fundamental   right   of   a   person\n\nmust have the authority of law to support it. A post­\n\nconstitutional   law   or   executive   act   that   violates\n\nfundamental   rights   is   still   born   and   void   ab   initio.\n\nFurther   there   was   no   consent,   let   alone   informed\n\nconsent   obtained   from   individuals   at   the   time   of\n\nenrolment under the said notification. A   validating\n\nlaw   must   remove   the   cause   of   invalidity   of   previous\n\nacts. The cause of invalidity in the present case was\n\nthe absence of a law governing privacy infringements.\n\nHowever,\nSection   59\ndoes   not   create   such   a   legal\n\nfiction where the Aadhaar Act is  deemed to have been\n\nin   existence   since   2009.   It   only   declares   a   legal\n\nconsequence of acts done by Union since 2009, which it\n\ncannot do.   No procedural safeguards existed pre­2016\n\nand   thus,   even   assuming   that\nSection   59\nis   validly\n\nenacted,   it   has   to   be   declared   unconstitutional   for\n\nviolating\nArticles 14\nand\n21.\n\n286.   Replying   the   above   submissions,   respondents\n\nsubmit   that\nSection   59\nis   retrospective,   saving\n\nprovision which provides a retrospective effect to the\nnotification   dated   28.01.2009   and     anything   done   or\n\naction taken by the Central Government under the said\n\nResolution.\n\n287.  The expression ‘anything done or any action under\n\nthe   Resolution’   is   wide   enough   to   cover   all   the\n\nactions including memorandum of undertaken which UIDAI\n\nexecuted   as   Department   of   Central   Government.\n\nSection 59\nseeks to save and  continue under the said\n\nAct   what   was   done   under   the   executive   scheme.   The\n\nsubmission that breach of fundamental right cannot be\n\nretrospectively cured is incorrect. The last phrase of\n\nSection 59\nuses the expression “shall be deemed”, this\n\nexpression clearly indicates creation of fiction with\n\nthe   object   of   providing   legislative   support   to   the\n\naction   taken   before   the   Act.   That   seeks   to   continue\n\nthe   entire   architecture   of   Aadhaar   which   established\n\nunder the Government Resolution dated 28.01.2009. As a\n\nresult of deeming provision all the actions under the\n\naforesaid   scheme   shall   be   deemed   to   have   been   done\n\nunder   the   Act   and   not   under   the   aforesaid\n\nnotification.  We may have a look on\nSection 59\nof the\nAct which provides:\n\n“59. Anything done or any action taken by the\nCentral   Government   under   the   Resolution   of\nthe  Government   of   India,   Planning   Commission\nbearing   notification   number   A­43011/02/2009­\nAdmin. I, dated the 28th January, 2009, or by\nthe Department of Electronics and Information\nTechnology   under   the   Cabinet   Secretariat\nNotification bearing notification number S.O.\n2492(E),   dated   the   12th   September,   2015,   as\nthe case may be, shall be deemed to have been\nvalidly done or taken under this Act.”\n\n288.   Justice   G.P.   Singh   in   Principles   of   Statutory\n\nInterpretation,   14th  Edition,   while   explaining   the\n\nlegal   fiction   sum   up   the   Principle   in   the   following\n\nwords:\n\n“The Legislature is quite competent to create\na  legal  fiction,  in  other  words,   to  enact  a\ndeeming provision for the purpose of assuming\nexistence   of   a   fact   which   does   not   really\nexist   provided   the   declaration   of   non­\nexistent   facts   as   existing   does   not   offend\nthe  constitution.   Although   the   word  ‘deemed’\nis   usually   used,   a   legal   fiction   may   be\nenacted   without   using   that   word.   For\ninstance, the words ‘as if’ can also be used\nto create a legal fiction.\n\nIn   interpreting   a   provision   creating   a\nlegal fiction, the court is to ascertain for\nwhat   purpose   the   fiction   is   created,   and\nafter   ascertaining   this,   the   Court   is   to\nassume all those facts and consequences which\nare   incidental   or   inevitable   corollaries   to\nthe  giving  effect  to   the  fiction.  But  in   so\nconstruing   the   fiction   it   is   not   to   be\nextended   beyond   the   purpose   for   which   it   is\ncreated,   or   beyond   the   language   of   the\nsection by which it is created.”\n\n289.   A   Constitution   Bench   judgment   of   this   Court   in\n\nM/s.\nWest   Ramnad   Electric   Distribution   Co.   Ltd.   vs.\n\nThe State of Madras and another\n, AIR 1962 SC 1753, has\n\nbeen   heavily   relied   by   the   respondents.   The   Madras\n\nLegislature had passed an Act, the Madras Electricity\n\nSupply Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, 1949 for supply\n\nof electricity in the province of Madras. By an order\n\ndated   17.05.1951   appellant   undertaking   was   acquired\n\nand   possession   was   directed   to   be   taken.\nThere   was\n\nchallenge   to   1949   Act   which   challenge   was   upheld   by\n\nthis Court in  Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation\n\nLtd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1954 SC 251,  on\n\nthe   ground   that   Act   was   beyond   the   legislative\n\ncompetence   of   the   Madras   Legislature.   The   Madras\n\nLegislature passed another Act, the Madras Electricity\n\nSupply   Undertakings   (Acquisition)   Act,   1949,   which\n\nalso   received   the   Presidential   assent.\nThe   Act\n\npurported to validate the action taken under the 1949\nAct.   A   writ   petition   was   filed   in   Madras   High   Court\n\nchallenging   the   action   taken   under   1949   Act   to\n\ncontinue   the   possession.   The   writ   petition   was\n\ndismissed and the matter was taken to this Court. The\n\ncontention which was raised before this Court has been\n\nnoticed in paragraph 8 in the following words:\n\n“8....Mr.   Nambiar   further   contends  that   this\nnotification was invalid for two reasons; it\nwas invalid because it has been issued under\nthe   Provisions   of   an   Act   which   was   void   as\nbeing   beyond   the   legislative   competence   of\nthe   Madras   Legislature,   and   it   was   void   for\nthe   additional   reason   that   before   it   was\nissued,   the   Constitution   of   India   had   come\ninto   force   and   it   offended   against   the\nprovisions   of\nArt.   31\nof   the   Constitution,\nand so,\nArt. 13(2)\napplied.\nSection 24\nof the\nAct,   no   doubt,   purported   or   attempted   to\nvalidate   this   notification,   but   the   said\nattempt   has   failed   because   the   Act   being\nprospective,   s.  24   cannot   have   retrospective\noperation.   That,   in   substance,   is   the   first\ncontention raised before us.”\n\n290.\nSection   24\nof   the   1949   Act   which   created   a\n\ndeeming fiction validating the actions taken under the\n\nearlier Act has been noticed in paragraph 11 which is\n\nto the following effect:\n\n“11.   Let   us   then   construe\nsection   24\nand\ndecide whether it serves to validate the\nimpugned   notification   issued   by   the\nrespondent on the 21st September, 1951.\n\nSection 24\nreads thus :­\n\"Orders   made,   decisions   or\ndirections   given,   notifications\nissued,   proceedings   taken   and   acts\nof   things   done,   in   relation   to   any\nundertaking   taken   ever,   if   they\nwould have been validly made, given,\nissued,   taken   or   done,   had   the\nMadras   Electricity   Supply\nUndertakings (Acquisition) Act, 1949\n(Madras Act XLIII of 1949), and the\nrules made thereunder been in force\non   the   date   on   which   the   said\norders,   decisions   or   directions,\nnotifications,   proceeding,   acts   or\nthings,   were   made,   given,   issued,\ntaken or done are hereby declared to\nhave   been   validly   made,   given,\nissued,   taken   or   done,   as   the   case\nmay   be,   except   to   the   extent   to\nwhich   the   said   orders,   decisions,\ndirections,   notifications,\nproceedings,   acts   or   things   are\nrepugnant to the provisions of this\nActs.\"”\n\n291.   Repelling   the   submission   of   counsel   for   the\n\nappellant it was held that\nSection 24\nhad been enacted\n\nfor   the   purpose   of   retrospectively   validating   action\n\ntaken   under   the   provisions   of   the   earlier   Act.\n\nFollowing was held in paragraph 13:\n“13....\nIf   the   Act\nis   retrospective   in\noperation and\ns. 24\nhas been enacted for the\npurpose of retrospectively validating actions\ntaken   under   the   provisions   of   the   earlier\nAct, it must follow by the very retrospective\noperation of the relevant provisions that at\nthe   time   when   the   impugned   notification   was\nissued,   these   provisions   were   in   existence.\nThat  is  the  plain  and  obvious  effect  of  the\nretrospective   operation   of   the   statute.\nTherefore   in   considering   whether\nArt.   31(1)\n\nhas been complied with or not, we must assume\nthat before the notification was issued, the\nrelevant   provisions   of   the   Act   were   in\nexistence and so,\nArt. 31(1)\nmust be held to\nhave been complied with in that sense.”\n\n292.   The submission was made that notification issued\n\nunder the earlier Act contravenes\nArticle 31\nwhich is\n\na   fundamental   right   and   cannot   be   cured   by   the\n\nsubsequent   law.   The   contention   has   been   noted   in\n\nparagraph 15:\n\n15. That takes us to the larger issue raised\nby   Mr.   Nambiar   in   the   present   appeals.   He\ncontends that the power of the legislature to\nmake   laws retrospective   cannot validly   be\nexercised so as to care the contravention of\nfundamental   rights   retrospectively.   His\ncontention   is   that   the   earlier   Act   of   1949\nbeing   dead   and   non­existent,   the   impugned\nnotification   contravened\nArt.   31(1)\nand  this\ncontravention   of   a   fundamental   right   cannot\nbe   cured   by   the   legislature   by   passing   a\nsubsequent   law   and   making   it   retrospective.\n\nIn support of this argument, he has relied on\nthe  decision   of  this   Court   in  Deep   Chand   v.\n\nThe   State   of   Uttar   Pradesh   (1959)   Supp.   2\nS.C.R. 8.(AIR 1959 SC 648)....”\n\n293.   It   was   held   by   the   Constitution   Bench   that   the\n\nLegislature   can   effectively   exercise   power   of\n\nvalidating   action   taken   under   the   law   which   was   void\n\nfor the reason that it contravened fundamental right.\n\nIn paragraph 16 following has been held:\n\n“16....If   a   law   is   invalid   for   the   reason\nthat   it   has   been   passed   by   a   legislature\nwithout legislative competence, and action is\ntaken   under   its   provisions,   the   said   action\ncan   be   validated   by   a   subsequent   law   passed\nby   the   same   legislature   after   it   is   clothed\nwith   the   necessary   legislative   power.   This\nposition is not disputed. If the legislature\ncan   by   retrospective   legislation   cure   the\ninvalidity   in   actions   taken   in   pursuance   of\nlaws which were void for want of legislative\ncompetence   and   can   validate   such   action   by\nappropriate   provisions,   it   is   difficult   to\nsee   why   the   same   power   cannot   be   equally\neffectively   exercised   by   the   legislature   in\nvalidating actions taken under law which are\nvoid   for   the   reason   that   they   contravened\nfundamental   rights.   As   has   been   pointed   out\nby   the   majority   decision   in   Deep   Chand's\ncase,   the   infirmity   proceeding   from   lack   of\nlegislative   competence   as   well   as   the\ninfirmity   proceeding   from   the   contravention\nof fundamental rights lead to the same result\nand that is that the offending legislation is\nvoid   and   honest.   That   being   so,   if   the\nlegislature can validate actions taken under\none   class   of   void   legislation,   there   is   no\nreason why it cannot exercise its legislative\npower   to   validate   actions   taken   under   the\nother   class   of   void   legislation.   We   are,\ntherefore,   not   prepared   to   accept   Mr.\nNambiar's   contention   that   where   the\ncontravention   of   fundamental   rights   is\nconcerned, the legislature cannot pass a law\nretrospectively   validate   actions   taken   under\na   law   which   was   void   because   it   contravened\nfundamental rights.”\n\n294.  Shri Shyam Divan submits that the above judgment\n\nof   this   Court   in  M/s.   West   Ramnad   Electric\n\nDistribution   Co.Ltd.  is   not   applicable.   He   submits\n\nthat unlike Section 59 of Aadhaar Act, the provisions\n\nin\nWest   Ramnad\ncase    had   no   limiting   words   such   as\n\n‘action taken by the Central Government’.\n\nFurther even\n\nunder the\nWest Ramnad\ncase  principle, the action can\n\nbe   saved   would   have   to   be   proper   under   the   previous\n\nregime.  West   Ramnad  actions   were  under   an   earlier\n\nstatute that was declared ultra vires, which cannot be\n\nsaved   under   Section   59   of   the   Aadhaar   Act.   The\n\ncollection   of   biometrics   from   individuals   right   upto\n\n2016 cannot be described as lawful and intra vires the\n\n2009   notification.   If   it   were   ultra   vires   the   2009\nnotification,   Section   59   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   cannot\n\nvalidate the action.\n\n295.  We have already noticed the ratio of the judgment\n\nas   stated   in   paragraph   16   in   the   judgment   in\nWest\n\nRamnad\ncase  that   even   if   earlier   action   which   is\n\nsought   to   be   validated   was   ultra   vires   and   violates\n\nconstitutional   right,   it   could   have   been   very   well\n\nvalidated by retrospective statute creating a deeming\n\nfiction.\n\nWe   are   of   the   view   that\nratio\nlaid   down   in\n\nWest   Ramnad\ncase  is  fully   applicable   in   the   present\n\ncase.\n\n296.   Another   Constitution   Bench   in\nBishambhar   Nath\n\nKohli and others v. State of Uttar Pradesh and others\n,\n\nAIR 1966 SC 573,  had occasion to consider the deeming\n\nfiction   as   contained   under   Act   31   of   1950.\nSection\n\n58(3)\nof   Act   31   of   1950   as   deeming   provision   that\n\nanything done or action taken in exercise of the power\n\nconferred under Ordinance 27  of 1949  is to be deemed\n\nto   have   been   done   or   taken   in   exercise   of   the   power\nconferred by or under Act 31 of 1950. In paragraphs 7\n\nand 8 of the judgment following has been laid down:\n\n“7.   By   Ordinance   27   of   1949   a   proceeding\ncommenced   under   Ordinance   12   of   1949   or\nanything done or action taken in the exercise\nof the powers conferred under that Ordinance\nwas   to   be   deemed   a   proceeding   commenced,\nthing done and action taken under the former\nOrdinance as if that Ordinance were in force\non   the   date   on   which   the   proceeding   was\ncommenced,   thing   was   done   or   action   was\ntaken.\nSection   58(3)\nof   Act   31   of   1950\ncontained   a   similar   deeming   provision   that\nanything done or action taken in exercise of\nthe   power   conferred   under   Ordinance   27   of\n1949   is   to   be   deemed   to   have   been   done   or\ntaken   in   exercise   of   the   power   conferred   by\nor under Act 31 of 1950, as if the Act were\nin force on the day on which such thing was\ndone or action was taken.\n\n8. By this chain of fictions, things done and\nactions taken under Ordinance 12 of 1949 are\nto   be   deemed   to   have   been   done   or   taken   in\nexercise of the powers conferred under Act 31\nof 1950, as if that Act we re in force on the\nday   on   which   such   thing   was   done   or   action\ntaken.   The   order   passed   by   the   Deputy\nCustodian under\ns. 6\nof Ordinance 12 of 1949\nwas,   therefore,   for   the   purpose   of   this\nproceeding,   to   be   deemed   an   order   made   in\nexercise of the power conferred by Act 31 of\n1950 as if that Act were in force on the day\non which the order was passed.”\n\n297.  The ratio of judgment in\nWest Ramnad\n(supra) has\n\nbeen   repeatedly   applied   by   this   Court   in   several\njudgments.\n\nReference is made to\nHari Singh and others\n\nvs. The Military Estate Officer and another\n, 1972 (2)\n\nSCC   239,  which   was   a   case   rendered   by   a   seven­Judge\n\nConstitution Bench. In paragraph 16 following has been\n\nheld:\n\n“16. The ruling of this Court in West Ramnad\nElectric   Distribution   Co.   Ltd.(1)   case\nestablishes  competence   of   the   legislature   to\nmake laws retrospective in operation for the\npurpose of validation of action done under an\nearlier   Act   which   has   been   declared   by   a\ndecision of the court to be invalid. It is to\nbe   appreciated   that   the   validation   is   by\nvirtue   of   the   provisions   of   the   subsequent\npiece of legislation.”\n\n298. Justice   Krishna   Iyer,   J.   in\nKrishna   Chandra\n\nGangopadhyaya   and   others   vs.   The   Union   of   India   and\n\nothers\n, 1975 (2) SCC 302, while considering validation\n\nof   Act   held   that   the   Legislature   can   retrospectively\n\nvalidate what otherwise was inoperative law or action.\n\nIn paragraph 25 following has been held:\n\n“25.   The   ratio   of\nWest   Ramnad\n(supra)   is\nclear.   The   Legislature   can   retrospectively\nvalidate   what   otherwise   was   inoperative   law\nor   action.   Unhappy   wording,   infelicitous\nexpression   or   imperfect   or   inartistic\ndrafting may not necessarily defeat, for that\nreason   alone,   the   obvious   object   of   the\nvalidating   law   and   its   retrospective\ncontent.”\n\n299.   This   Court   again   in\nITW   Signode   India   Ltd.   vs.\n\nCollector   of   Central   Excise\n,   2004   (3)   SCC   48,  held\n\nthat   curative   statutes   by   their   very   nature   are\n\nintended to operate upon and affect past transaction.\n\nIn paragraph 61 following has been held:\n\n“61. A statute, it is trite, must be read as\na whole. The plenary power of legislation of\nthe   Parliament   or   the   State   Legislature   in\nrelation   to  the  legislative  fields   specified\nunder Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of\nIndia is not disputed. A statutory act may be\nenacted   prospectively   or   retrospectively.   A\nretrospective   effect   indisputably   can   be\ngiven   in   case   of   curative   and   validating\nstatute.   In   fact   curative   statutes   by   their\nvery nature are intended to operate upon and\naffect past transaction having regard to the\nfact that they operate on conditions already\nexisting.   However,   the   scope   of   the\nvalidating act may vary from case to case.”\n\n300.   The argument that an action or provision hit by\n\nArticle   14\ncan   never   be   validated   was   specifically\n\nrejected   by   this   Court   in  The   State   of   Mysore   and\n\nanother vs. d. Achiah Chetty, Etc., (1969) 1 SCC 248,\n\nin paragraph 15 following has been held:\n“15. Mr. S. T. Desai, however, contends that\nan acquisition hit by\nArticle 14\nor anything\ndone   previously   cannot   ever   be   validated,\nunless   the   vice   of   unreasonable\nclassification   is   removed   and   the   Validating\nAct   is   ineffective   for   that   reason.   This\nargument leads to the logical conclusion that\na   discrimination   arising   from   selection   of\none   law   for   action   rather   than   the   other,\nwhen two procedures are available, can never\nbe righted by removing retrospectively one of\nthe competing laws from the field. This is a\nwrong assumption....”\n\n301.   A   statute   creates   a   legal   fiction   to   achieve   a\n\nlegislative   purpose.   We   may   refer   to   the   celebrated\n\njudgment of Lord Asquith in  East End Dwelling Co.Ltd.\n\nAnd Finsury Borough Council, 1952 AC 109, following is\n\nthe enunciation of Lord Asquith:\n\n“If you are bidden to treat an imaginary\nstate   of   affairs   as   real,   you   must   surely,\nunless prohibited from doing so, also imagine\nas real the consequences and incidents which,\nif the putative state of affairs had in fact\nexisted, must inevitably have flowed from or\naccompanied   it...   The   statute   says   that   you\nmust   imagine   a   certain   state   of   affairs;   it\ndoes   not   say   that   having   done   so,   you   must\ncause   or   permit   your   imagination   to   boggle\nwhen   it   comes   to   the   inevitable   corollaries\nof that state of affairs.”\n\n302.   Legislature   has   often   created   legal   fiction   to\n\nsave several actions which had happened prior to\nenactment. Reference is made to judgment of this Court\n\nin\nNar   Bahadur   Bhandari   and   another   vs.   State\nof\n\nsikkim and others, (1998) 5 SCC 39.  In\nthe above case\n\ndeeming   fiction   was   created   by\nSection   30\nof\n\nPrevention   of   Corruption   Act,   1988.\nSection   30\n\nprovides   that   any   action   taken   or   purported   to   have\n\nbeen done or taken under or in pursuance of the Acts\n\nso repeated shall be deemed to have been done or taken\n\nunder 1988 Act.  Following was stated in paragraph 10:\n\n“10....In   the   present   case,   the   Act   of   1988\nis the repealing Act. Sub­sec. (2) of\nSection\nreads as follows:\n\n\"30(2)   Notwithstanding   such   repeal,\nbut   without   prejudice   to   the\napplication   of\nsection   6\nof   the\nGeneral   Clauses   Act   1897   (10   of\n1897),   anything   done   or   any   action\ntaken or purported to have been done\nor   taken   under   or   in   pursuance   of\nthe   Acts   so   repealed   shall,   in   so\nfar   as   it   is   not   inconsistent   with\nthe   provisions   of   this   Act,   be\ndeemed   to   have   been   done   or   taken\nunder   or   in   pursuance   of   the\ncorresponding   provision   of   this\nAct.\"\n\n12.   The   said   Sub­section   while   on   the   one\nhand ensures that the application of\nSection\nof   the   General   Clauses   Act   is   not\nprejudiced,   on   the   other   it   expresses   a\ndifferent   intention   as   contemplated   by   the\nsaid\nSection   6\n.   The   last   part   of   the   above\nSub­section   introduces   a   legal   fiction\nwhereby   anything   done   or   action   taken   under\nor in pursuance of the Act of 1947 shall be\ndeemed to have been done or taken under or in\npursuance   of   corresponding   provisions   of   the\nAct of 1988. That is, the fiction is to the\neffect   that   the   Act   of   1988   had   come   into\nforce when such thing was done or action was\ntaken.”\n\n303.  An elaborate consideration on deeming fiction was\n\nmade   by   three­Judge   Bench   of   this   Court   in\nState   of\n\nKarnataka vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others\n, (2017) 3\n\nSCC   362,  one   of   us,   Justice   Dipak   Misra,   as   he   then\n\nwas, speaking for the Court in paragraphs 72 to 74:\n\n“72.   The   second   limb   of   submission   of   Mr.\nRohatgi   as   regards   the   maintainability\npertains   to   the   language   employed   Under\n\nSection 6(2)\nof the 1956 Act, which reads as\nfollows:\n\n“6(2)   The   decision   of   the   Tribunal,\nafter its publication in the Official\nGazette   by   the   Central   Government\nunder Sub­section (1), shall have the\nsame force as an order or decree of\nthe Supreme Court.”\n\n73.   Relying   on\nSection   6(2)\n,   which   was\nintroduced by way of Amendment Act 2002 (Act\nNo.   14   of   2002)   that   came   into   force   from\n6.8.2002, it is submitted by Mr. Rohatgi that\nthe   jurisdiction   of   this   Court   is   ousted   as\nit   cannot   sit   over   in   appeal   on   its   own\ndecree.   The   said   submission   is   seriously\nresisted   by   Mr.   Nariman   and   Mr.   Naphade,\nlearned   senior   Counsel   contending   that   the\nsaid provision, if it is to be interpreted to\nexclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court\nof   India,   it   has   to   be   supported   by   a\nconstitutional amendment adding at the end of\n\nArticle   136(2)\nthe   words   \"or   to   any\ndetermination   of   any   tribunal   constituted\nunder   the   law   made   by   Parliament   Under\n\nArticle 262(2)\"\nand, in such a situation, in\nall   possibility   such   an   amendment   to   the\nConstitution may be ultra vires affecting the\npower  of   judicial  review   which   is  a  part   of\nbasic   feature   of   the   Constitution.   Learned\nsenior Counsel for the Respondent has drawn a\ndistinction   between   the   conferment   and   the\nexclusion   of   the   power   of   the   Supreme   Court\nof India by the original Constitution and any\nexclusion by the constitutional amendment. Be\nthat as it may, the said aspect need not be\nadverted   to,   as   we   are   only   required   to\ninterpret\nSection 6(2)\nas it exists today on\nthe statute book. The said provision has been\ninserted to provide teeth to the decision of\nthe   tribunal   after   its   publication   in   the\nofficial   gazette   by   the   Central   Government\nand   this   has   been   done   keeping   in   view   the\nSarkaria   Commission's   Report   on   Centre­State\nrelations (1980). The relevant extract of the\nSarkaria   Commission's   Report   reads   as\nfollows:\n\n17.4.19\nThe   Act\nwas   amended in   1980\nand   Section   6A   was   inserted.   This\nSection provides for framing a scheme\nfor   giving   effect   to   a   Tribunal's\naward.   The   scheme,   inter   alia\nprovides for the establishment of the\nauthority,   its   term   of   office   and\nother condition of service, etc. but\nthe   mere   creation   of   such   an   agency\nwill   not   be   able   to   ensure\nimplementation of a Tribunal's award.\n\nAny   agency   set   up   Under   Section   6A\ncannot   really   function   without   the\ncooperation of the States concerned.\n\nFurther,   to   make   a   Tribunal's   award\nbinding   and   effectively   enforceable,\nit   should   have   the   same   force   and\nsanction   behind   it   as   an   order   or\ndecree   of   the   Supreme   Court.   We\nrecommend   that   the   Act   should   be\nsuitably amended for this purpose.\n\n17.6.05   ­   The   Inter­State   Water\nDisputes Act, 1956 should be amended\nso   that   a   Tribunal's   Award   has   the\nsame force and sanction behind it as\nan   order   or   decree   of   the   Supreme\nCourt   to   make   a   Tribunal's   award\nreally binding.\n\n74....Parliament   has   intentionally   used   the\nwords  from  which  it  can  be  construed  that  a\nlegal   fiction   is   meant   to   serve   the   purpose\nfor   which   the   fiction   has   been   created   and\nnot intended to travel beyond it. The purpose\nis   to   have   the   binding   effect   of   the\ntribunal's   award   and   the   effectiveness   of\nenforceability.   Thus,   it   has   to   be   narrowly\nconstrued regard being had to the purpose it\nis meant to serve.\n\n304.   In   paragraphs   75,   76   and   77   following   has   been\n\nlaid down:\n\n“75.   In   this   context,   we   may   usefully   refer\nto   the   Principles   of   Statutory\nInterpretation,   14th   Edition   by   G.P.   Singh.\nThe learned author has expressed thus:\n\n“In interpreting a provision creating\na   legal   fiction,   the   court   is   to\nascertain   for   what   purpose   the\nfiction   is   created1,   and   after\nascertaining   this,   the   Court   is   to\nassume   all   those   facts   and\nconsequences which are incidental or\ninevitable corollaries to the giving\neffect   to   the   fiction.   But   in   so\nconstruing   the   fiction   it   is   not   be\nextended beyond the purpose for which\nis created, or beyond the language of\nthe Section by which it is created4.\n\nIt   cannot   also   be   extended   by\nimporting   another   fiction5.   The\nprinciples   stated   above   are   'well­\nsettled'. A legal fiction may also be\ninterpreted   narrowly   to   make   the\nstatute workable.”\n\n76.\nIn\nAneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels and\nTours\n, (2012) 5 SCC 661, a three­Judge Bench\nhas ruled thus:\n\n“37.\nIn\nState   of   T.N.   v.   Arooran\nSugars   Ltd.\n,   (1997)   1   SCC   326   the\nConstitution   Bench,   while   dealing\nwith   the   deeming   provision   in   a\nstatute,   ruled   that   the   role   of   a\nprovision in a statute creating legal\nfiction   is   well   settled.\n\nReference\nwas made to\nChief Inspector of Mines\nv.   Karam   Chand   Thapar\n,   AIR   1961   SC\n838, J.K. Cotton Spg. and Wvg. Mills\nLtd.   v.   Union   of   India,   1987   Supp.\n\nSCC 350, M. Venugopal v. LIC\n, (1994)\n2 SCC 323 and Harish Tandon v. ADM,\nAllahabad,   (1995)   1   SCC   537   and\neventually,   it   was   held   that   when   a\nstatute   creates   a   legal   fiction\nsaying that something shall be deemed\nto have been done which in fact and\ntruth   has   not   been   done,   the   Court\nhas   to   examine   and   ascertain   as   to\nfor   what   purpose   and   between   which\npersons   such   a   statutory   fiction   is\nto be resorted to and thereafter, the\ncourts   have   to   give   full   effect   to\nsuch   a   statutory   fiction   and   it   has\nto   be   carried   to   its   logical\nconclusion.”\n\n38.   From   the   aforesaid\npronouncements,   the   principle   that\ncan be culled out is that it is the\nbounden   duty   of   the   court   to\nascertain for what purpose the legal\nfiction has been created. It is also\nthe duty of the court to imagine the\nfiction   with   all   real   consequences\nand instances unless prohibited from\ndoing so. That apart, the use of the\nterm \"deemed\" has to be read in its\ncontext   and   further,   the   fullest\nlogical purpose and import are to be\nunderstood.   It   is   because   in   modern\nlegislation,   the   term   \"deemed\"   has\nbeen used for manifold purposes. The\nobject   of   the   legislature   has   to   be\nkept in mind.”\n\n77. In Hari Ram,  the Court has  held that\nin   interpreting   the   provision   creating   a\nlegal   fiction,   the   court   is   to   ascertain\nfor   what   purpose   the   fiction   is   created\nand after ascertaining the same, the court\nis   to   assume   all   those   facts   and\nconsequences   which   are   incidental   or\ninevitable   corollaries   for   giving   effect\nto the fiction.”\n\n305.   Applying   the   ratio   of   this   Court   as   noticed\n\nabove,   it   is   clear   that   Parliamentary   legislative\n\nintent of\nSection 59\nis to save all actions taken by\n\nCentral   Government   under   the   notification   dated\n28.01.2009   and   notification   dated   12.09.2015   deeming\n\nthe same  to have  been validly done  under  the Aadhaar\n\nAct by creating a legal fiction. The intention to save\n\nall   actions   taken   under   the   aforesaid   two\n\nnotifications   and   treat   them   to   have   done   under   that\n\nAct is clear, it is the purpose and object of Section\n\n59.\nSection 59\nhas to be  interpreted to give meaning\n\nto   the   legislative   intent   to   hold   otherwise   shall\n\ndefeat   the   purpose   of\nSection   59\n.   As   observed,\n\nLegislature   by   legislative   device   can   cover   actions\n\ntaken   earlier   while   creating   any   legal   fiction   which\n\nhas actually been done by\nSection 59\n.\n\n306.   There is one more submission of the petitioners\n\nto be considered. Petitioner’s case is that there was\n\nno   consent   or   informed   consent   obtained   from\n\nindividuals   for   enrolment   made   consequent   to\n\nnotification   dated   28.01.2009,   the   notification   dated\n\n28.01.2009 and the scheme thereafter does not clearly\n\nindicate that the enrolment for Aadhaar was voluntary.\n\nThis   Court   has   issued   an   interim   order   directing   the\n\nenrolment be treated as voluntary, hence, it cannot be\naccepted that those got enrolled after 28.01.2009 did\n\nnot give consent. The  individual provided demographic\n\ninformation   and   gave   biometric   information   and   also\n\nsigned   the   enrolment   form.     The   residents   after   the\n\nenrolment   were   required   to   confirm   that   information\n\ncontained   were   provided   by   them   and   are   of   his   own\n\ntrue   and   correct.   On   sign   slip,   he   was   required   to\n\nsign or put his thumb impression themselves. It is on\n\nthe   record   that   more   than   100   crores   enrolment   were\n\ncompleted   prior   to   enforcement   of   Aadhaar   Act   2016.\n\nOn   the   basis   of   Aadhaar   Act   large   number   of   persons\n\nmust have received benefits of subsidies and services,\n\nthus, the enrolments prior to enforcement of Act, 2016\n\ncannot   be declared   illegal   and   void.   In   view   of   the\n\naforementioned   discussion,   we   answer   the   Issue   No.12\n\nin the following manner;\n\nAns.12:­\nSection 59\nhas validated all actions taken by\n\nthe   Central   Government   under   the\n\nnotifications   dated   28.01.2009     and\n12.09.2009 and all actions shall be deemed to\n\nhave been taken under the Aadhaar Act.\n\nIssue No. 13 Whether   Collecting   the   identity\ninformation of children between 5 to 18\nyears is unconstitutional?\n\n307.\nSection 5\nof the Act provides that the Authority\n\nshall take special measures to issue Aadhaar number to\n\nwomen,   children,   senior   citizens,   persons   with\n\ndisability, unskilled and unorganised workers, nomadic\n\ntribes   or   to   such   other   persons   who   do   not   have   any\n\npermanent dwelling house and such other categories of\n\nindividuals   as   may   be   specified   by   regulations.\n\nSection   5\ncontemplates   special   measures   for   issuance\n\nof Aadhaar number to children.  The Aadhaar (Enrolment\n\nand   Update)   Regulations,   2016   contains   some   special\n\nmeasures.     One   of   the   special   measures   is\nRegulation\n,   which   provides   for   information   required   for\n\nenrolment   of   children   below   five   years   of   age.\n\nRegulation 5\nis as follows:­\n\n5.   Information   required   for   enrolment   of\nchildren  below  five  years  of  age.  —  (1)  For\nchildren   below   the   five   years   of   age,   the\nfollowing   demographic   and   biometric\ninformation shall be collected:\n\n(a) Name\n\n(b) Date of Birth\n\n(c) Gender\n\n(d) Enrolment ID or Aadhaar number of\nany   one   parent,   preferably   that   of\nthe mother in the event both parents\nare   alive,   or   guardian.   The   Aadhaar\nnumber   or   EID   of   such   parent   or\nguardian   is   mandatory,   and   a   field\nfor   relationship   will   also   be\nrecorded.\n\n(e)   The   address   of   such   child   which\nis   the   same   as   that   of   the   linked\nparent / guardian.\n\n(f)   Facial   image   of   the   child   shall\nbe   captured.   The   biometric\ninformation   of   any   one   parent   /\nguardian   shall   be   captured   or\nauthenticated during the enrolment.\n\n(2) The Proof of Relationship (PoR) document\nas listed in schedule II for establishing the\nrelationship   between   the   linked\nparent/guardian   and   the   child   shall   be\ncollected   at   the   time   of   enrolment.   Only\nthose   children   can   be   enrolled   based   on   the\nrelationship   document   (PoR),   whose   names   are\nrecorded in the relationship document.\n\n308.   For   children   below   five,   no   core   biometric\ninformations   are   captured   and   only   biometric\n\ninformation   of   any   one   parent/guardian   is   captured.\n\nThe objection raised by petitioners is with regard to\n\nchildren between 5 to 18 years on the ground that they\n\nbeing minors, parental consent is not taken.   We have\n\nnoted   above   that   for   Aadhaar   enrolment,   for\n\nverification   of   information   consent   is   obtained   from\n\nthe   person   submitting   for   enrolment.     Thus,   the\n\nenrolment   for   Aadhaar   number   is   on   consent   basis.\n\nAlthough, it is different matter that for the purpose\n\nof   obtaining   any   benefit   or   service,   a   person   is\n\nobliged   to   enrol   for   Aadhaar.     The   petitioners   are\n\nright   in   their   submissions   that   for   enrolment   of   a\n\nchildren   between   5   and   18   years,   there   has   to   be\n\nconsent   of   their   parents   or   guardian   because   they\n\nthemselves   are   unable   to   give   any   valid   consent   for\n\nenrolment.  We, thus, have to read parental consent in\n\nRegulation   4\nin   so   far   as   children   of   5   to   18   years\n\nare   concerned   so   that   the   provision   in   reference   to\n\nchildren   between   5   to   18   years   may   not   become\n\nunconstitutional.     We   thus   answer   Question   No.   13   in\nfollowing manner:­\n\nAns.13:­  Parental   consent   for   providing   biometric\n\ninformation  under\nRegulation   3\n&   demographic\n\ninformation under\nRegulation 4\nhas to be read\n\nfor   enrolment   of   children   between   5   to   18\n\nyears   to   upheld   the   constitutionality   of\n\nRegulations 3   &   4   of   Aadhaar   (Enrolment   and\n\nUpdate) Regulations, 2016.\n\nIssue No.14 Whether   Rule   9   as   amended   by   the\nPrevention   of   Money­Laundering   (Second\nAmendment)   Rules,   2017   is\nunconstitutional?\n\n309.   For answering the above issue we need to advert\n\nto the objects and scheme of the Prevention of Money­\n\nLaundering   Act,   2002\n(PMLA,   2002).   The   scheme   as\n\ndelineated   by   the   Prevention   of   Money­Laundering\n\n(Maintenance   of   Records)   Rules,   2005   also   need   to   be\n\nlooked   into   before   coming   to   the   Second   Amendment\n\nRules,   2017.   The   PMLA,   2002   has   been   enacted   to\n\nprevent   money­laundering   and   to   provide   for\n\nconfiscation of property derived from, or involved in,\nmoney­laundering   and   for   matters

  Every   nation   tries   to   march   forward   in\n\nachieving   the   rapid   economic   growth.   Economics   is\n\nfactor which not only plays a major role in the future\n\nof nation but also in all human organisations. Most of\n\nthe   individuals   also   aspire   for   their   financial   well\n\nbeing   but   for   the   financial   system   and   working   of\n\neconomic, road blocks are felt both by the nations and\n\nhuman   organisations.     The   siphoning   away   of   huge\n\nvolumes   of   money   from   normal   economic   growth   poses   a\n\nreal danger to the economics and affects the stability\n\nof   the   global   market   which   also   empowers   corruption\n\norganised   crime.   Proceeds   of   money­laundering   are\n\ndisguised to acquire properties and other assets or to\n\nmake   investments.   At   some   stage   money­laundering\n\ninvolves conversion process with the objective to give\n\nthe appearance that the money has a legitimate source.\n\nThe   banking   and   financial   secrecy   is   another\n\nbottleneck for countries who genuinely want to counter\n\nmoney­laundering.   It   is   inherent   in   the   activity   of\nmoney­laundering   to   keep   the   entire   process   secret.\n\nThe   Parliament   with   the   objectives   outlined   in   the\n\ninternational declaration enacted the\nPMLA Act\n. Para 1\n\nof   the   Statement   of   Objects   and   Reasons   of

financial   systems   of   countries,\nbut also to their integrity and sovereignty.\nSome   of   the   initiatives   taken   by   the\ninternational   community   to   obviate   such\nthreat are outlined below:—\n\n(a)   the United   Nations   Convention   Against\nIllicit   Traffic   in   Narcotic   Drugs   and\nPsychotropic Substances, to which India is a\nparty, calls for prevention of laundering of\nproceeds   of   drug   crimes   and   other   connected\nactivities   and   confiscation   of   proceeds\nderived from such offence.\n\n(b)   the   Basle   Statement   of   Principles,\nenunciated   in   1989,   outlined   basic   policies\nand   procedures   that   banks   should   follow   in\norder to assist the law enforcement agencies\nin tackling the problem of moneylaundering.\n\n(c)   the   Financial   Action   Task   Force\nestablished   at   the   summit   of   seven   major\nindustrial   nations,   held   in   Paris   from   14th\nto 16th July, 1989, to examine the problem of\nmoney­laundering   has   made   forty\nrecommendations, which provide the foundation\nmaterial   for   comprehensive   legislation   to\ncombat   the   problem   of   moneylaundering.   The\nrecommendations were classified under various\nheads. Some of the important heads are—\n\n(i)   declaration   of   laundering   of\nmonies carried through serious crimes\na criminal offence;\n\n(ii)   to   work   out   modalities   of\ndisclosure   by   financial   institutions\nregarding reportable transactions;\n\n(iii) confiscation of the proceeds of\ncrime;\n\n(iv) declaring money­laundering to be\nan extraditable offence; and\n\n(v)   promoting   international   co­\noperation   in   investigation   of\nmoneylaundering.\n\n(d)   the   Political   Declaration   and   Global\nProgramme of Action adopted by United Nations\nGeneral Assembly by its Resolution No. S­17/2\nof   23rd   February,   1990,   inter   alia,   calls\nupon   the   member   States   to   develop   mechanism\nto   prevent   financial   institutions   from   being\nused for laundering of drug related money and\nenactment   of   legislation   to   prevent   such\nlaundering.\n\n(e) the United Nations in the Special Session\non   countering   World   Drug   Problem   Together\nconcluded  on   the  8th   to  the  10th  June,  1998\nhas   made   another

which was introduced in the Lok\n\nSabha. The Bill was referred to the Standing Committee\n\non   Finance,   which   submitted   its   report   on   04.03.1999\n\nto   the   Lok   Sabha.   Various   recommendations   of   the\n\nStanding   Committee   were   accepted   by   the   Central\n\nGovernment   and   made   provisions   of   the   said\n\nrecommendations in the Bill. Thereafter, the Bill was\n\npresented in the Parliament which after receiving the\n\nassent   of   the   President   published   in   the   Gazette   on\n\n01.07.2005.   Act,   2002   has   been   amended   by   various\n\nParliamentary   Acts.   By   amendments   made   in   the   year\n\n2013 by Act 2 of 2013, the  Legislature has  attempted\n\nto keep the pace with the other countries of the world\n\nby   making   more   stringent   provision   to   prevent   money­\n\nlaundering which is the root as well as the result of\n\nthe   black   money   economy.   Money­laundering   is   defined\n\nunder\nSection 3\nwhich is to the following effect:\n\n“3.   Offence   of   money­Laundering.­Whosoever\ndirectly or indirectly attempts to indulge or\nknowingly assists or knowingly is a party or\nis   actually   involved   in   any   process   or\nactivity

  reporting\nentity.”\n\n316.   The challenge to Second Amendment Rules, 2017 is\n\non   the   ground   that   it   violate\nArticles   14\n,   19(1)(g)\n,\nand\n300A\nof the Constitution of India; Sections 3,\n\n7   and   51   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   and   also   ultra   vires   to\n\nthe provisions of\nPMLA Act, 2002\n.\n\n317. Elaborating his submissions Shri Arvind P. Datar\n\nlearned   senior   counsel   submits   that   Second   Amendment\n\nRules violate\nArticle 14\nand\nsince persons choosing\nnot   to   enrol   for   Aadhaar   number   cannot   operate   bank\n\naccount   and   valid   explanation   has   to   be   given   as   to\n\nwhy all banks have to be authenticated.\n\n318.   Violative  of\nArticle  19(1)(g)\nbecause  the  Rules\n\nrefer   to   companies,   firms,   trusts,   etc.   whereas\n\nAadhaar   Act   is   only   to   establish   identity   of\n\nindividuals.   Violative   of\nArticle   300A\nsince   even\n\ntemporary   deprivation   can   only   be   done   by   primary\n\nlegislation.   The   Second   Amendment   Rules   do   not   pass\n\nproportionality   test.   No   proper   purpose   has   been\n\nestablished.   No   explanation   has   been   given   that   the\n\nmeasures   undertaken   to   such   are   rationale   and\n\nconnected to the fulfillment of the purpose and there\n\nare   no   alternative   measures   with   a   lesser   degree   of\n\nlegislation. When the banks have already verified all\n\naccounts   as   per   e­KYC   norms,   it   is   completely\n\narbitrary   to   make   permanent   linking/seeding   of   all\n\nAadhaar   numbers   with   the   bank   accounts.   Second\n\nAmendment   Rules   fail   to   satisfy   the   proportionality\n\ntest, are irrational, and manifestly arbitrary.\n319.   Shri   Tushar   Mehta,   learned   Additional   Solicitor\n\nGeneral   refuting   the   submission,   submits   that   Second\n\nAmendment Rules carry on the object of 2002, Act. The\n\nverification of bank account by way of Aadhaar is done\n\nfor the reason that often bank accounts are opened in\n\neither   fictitious   names   or   in   the   name   of   wrong\n\npersons on the basis of forged identity documents and\n\nfinancial   crimes   are   committed.   It   is   seen   that\n\naccommodation entries are mostly provided through the\n\nbanking   channels   by   bogus   companies   to   convert   black\n\nmoney   into   white.   Benami   transactions   routinely   take\n\nplace through banking channels. All of the above, can\n\nto a large extent be checked by verifying Aadhaar with\n\nbank   accounts   to   ensure   that   the   account   belongs   to\n\nthe   person   who   claims   to   be   the   account   holder   and\n\nthat   he   or   she   is   a   genuine   person.   Verification   of\n\nbank account with Aadhaar also ensures that the direct\n\nbenefit   transfer   of   subsidies   reach   the   Aadhaar\n\nverified   bank   account   and   is   not   diverted   to   some\n\nother account. Shell companies are often used to open\n\nbank   accounts   to   hold   unaccounted   money   of   other\nentities under fictitious identities   which will also\n\nbe curbed once Aadhaar verification is initiated.\n\n320.    Now,   we   come   to   the   respective   submissions   of\n\nthe parties. A perusal of the Second Amendment Rules,\n\n2017 indicates that the State has sought to make the\n\nprovisions   of   PMLA   more   robust   and   ensure   that   the\n\nultimate   object   of   the   Act   is   achieved.\nAadhaar   Act,\nhaving been enacted with effect from 01.07.2016,\n\nit   was   decided   to   get   the   accounts   verified   by\n\nAadhaar.   Amended   Rules   help all   concerned   to   detect\n\nfictitious,   ghost   and   benami   accounts.   The   object   of\n\nthe   PMLA   and   the   definition   of   beneficial   owner   Act\n\nseeks   to   traverse   behind   the   corporate   veil   of   shell\n\ncompanies and spurious Directors in order to ascertain\n\nthe   real   natural   persons   controlling   the   accounts   in\n\nthe reporting entities. The Amendment Rules applicable\n\nto reporting entities and the legitimate aim sought to\n\nbe   achieved   by   the   State   that   is   conclusive\n\nidentification   of   a   natural   person   or   the   beneficial\n\nowner.   The statutory rules cast an obligation on all\n\naccount   holders   to   get   their   identity   verified   by\nAadhaar   mechanism   and   those   who   are   already   holding\n\naccount   in   the   reporting   entity   they   are   required   to\n\nsubmit   the   Aadhaar   number   or   proof   of   their   applied\n\nAadhaar   identity.   When   a   statute   puts   obligation   on\n\naccount   holder   to   get   identity   verification   in   a\n\nparticular manner a person chose not to obtain Aadhaar\n\nnumber   cannot   complain   his   dis­entitlement   of\n\noperating   his   account.   The   submission   of   the\n\npetitioner   that   there   is   no   valid   explanation   as   to\n\nwhy   all   bank   accounts   have   to   be   authenticated   also\n\ncannot be accepted. Aadhaar provides a mechanism truly\n\nidentifies   an   account   holder,   which   eliminates\n\nfraudulent accounts existed of non­existed persons and\n\nin ghost names. The object of inserting the Rule is to\n\nmake it possible to weed out  fake and duplicate PANs\n\nand   false   bank   accounts.   The   Second   Amendment   Rules\n\nare step in direction to cure the menace of  fake bank\n\naccounts   held   by   the   shell   companies   in   the   name   of\n\ndummy   directors,   money   laundering,   terror   financing\n\netc. It is  relevant to  notice that  Aadhaar number is\n\nrequired   to   be   given   at   the   time   of   opening   of   the\naccount   based     relationship   and   not   for   every\n\ntransaction   conducted   by   an   account   holder   of   the\n\nbank.   Those   who   have   already   existing   accounts   are\n\nrequired to submit only once their Aadhaar number for\n\nverification. The requirement of Aadhaar number being\n\ngiven   only   for   once   is   not   any   cumbersome   or   undue\n\nburden on an account holder. The object of the Second\n\nAmendment   Rules   is   towards   the   legitimate   aim   of   the\n\nState   and having   nexus   with   the   object   sought   to   be\n\nachieved   by   the   enactment.   The   submission   of   Aadhaar\n\nnumber   only   once   by   an   account   holder   is   a\n\nproportionate   measure.   We   have   already   referred   to\n\njudgments   where   doctrine   of   proportionality   has   been\n\nexpounded. While adjudging a statutory provision from\n\nthe   angle   of   the   proportionality   the   Court   has   to\n\nexamine   as   to   whether   statutory   measure   contained   in\n\nstatutory   provision   is   not   excessive   as   against   the\n\nobject   which   seeks   to   achieve.   The   legislature   has\n\nmargin of discretion while providing for one or other\n\nmeasures   to   achieve   an   object.   Unless   the   measures\n\nfoully   unreasonable   and   disproportionate,   court   does\nnot normally substitutes its opinion. On the basis of\n\nRule   9(17)(c),   petitioner   contends   that   in   the   event\n\naccount holder fails to submit the Aadhaar number and\n\nPAN     within   a     period   as   mentioned   in   the   aforesaid\n\nRules   account   shall   cease   to   be   operational   till   the\n\ntime   Aadhaar   number   and   PAN   is   submitted   by   the\n\nclient. Petitioner alleged violation of\nArticle 300A.\n\nThe petitioner’s  case is  that account of a person is\n\nhis property to which he cannot be deprived, saved by\n\nthe   authority   of   law.     For   non­submission   of   Aadhaar\n\nnumber and PAN only consequence which is contemplated\n\nby   sub­rule   (c)   is   that   account   shall   cease   to   be\n\noperational.   We   are   of   the   view   that   the   account\n\nremains belonging to the account holder and the amount\n\nin   the   account   is   only   his   amount   and   there   is   no\n\ndeprivation   of   the   property   of   account   holder.   Under\n\nthe   banking   rules   and   procedures,   there   are   several\n\ncircumstances   where   account   becomes   un­operational.   A\n\nnon­operational   account   also   is   an   account   which\n\nbelongs to the account holder and amount laying in the\n\nnon­operational   account   is   neither   forfeited   by   the\nbank   nor   taken   out   from   the   said   account.   Further,\n\naccount   is   ceased   operational   only   till   the   time\n\nAadhaar number and PAN is submitted. The consequences\n\nprovided is only to effectuate the purpose of the Act\n\nand   the   Rules   i.e.   account   be   verified   by   Aadhaar\n\nmechanism. It is not the intent to deprive the account\n\nholder of the amount lying in the account.   We, thus,\n\ndo   not   find   any   substance   in   the   submission   of   the\n\npetitioner   that   Rule   9(17)(c)   violates   right   under\n\nArticle   300A.\nAadhaar   number   providing   for\n\nverification of an  account also cannot be held to be\n\nviolating right under\nArticle 21.\nThe reporting entity\n\ni.e.   banks   and   financial   institutions   under   various\n\nstatutes are required to provide information of a bank\n\naccount to different authorities including income tax\n\nauthority, account verification by Aadhaar is not for\n\nthe purpose of keeping a track on the transaction done\n\nby an individual. As noted above Aadhaar number has to\n\nbe given only once for opening of the account or for\n\nverification   of   the   account   and   transactions   are   not\nto  be made  on the basis of  Aadhaar verification each\n\ntime.\n\n321.     One   of   the   submissions   which   has   been   made   by\n\nthe   petitioner   also   is   that   Rules   violate\nArticle\n\n19(1)(g).\nIt   is   submitted   that Rule   refers   to\n\ncompanies,   firms,   trusts   etc.   whereas   Aadhaar   Act   is\n\nonly to establish identity of individual. For example\n\nsub­rule (6) of Rule 9 as amended by Second Amendment\n\nRules,   2017   provides   that   where   client   is   a   company,\n\nit shall for the purposes of sub­rule (1),   submit to\n\nthe   reporting   entity   the   certified   copies   of   the\n\ndocuments   enumerated   therein.   Rule   requiring   Aadhaar\n\nnumber   and   PAN   or   Form   60   as   defined   in   Income   Tax\n\nRules, 1962, issued to managers, officers or employees\n\nholding   an   attorney   to   transact   on   the   company’s\n\nbehalf,  is for the purpose to find out the beneficial\n\nowner   behind   the   company.   One   of   the   objects   of   the\n\nAct   is   to   detect   money­laundering   wherever   it   is\n\nfound.   Inquiring   details   of   the   company   to   find   out\n\nshell   companies   and   ghost   companies   and   the   real\n\nbeneficial  owner  cannot be said to be foreign to the\nobject   of   the   Act.   Companies,   partnership   firms,\n\ntrusts   or   incorporated   institutions     or   body   of\n\nindividuals   cannot   complain   any   violation   of   rights\n\nunder\nArticle   19(1)(g).\nThere   is   no   amount   of\n\nrestriction in the right of aforesaid in carrying out\n\nany profession, or any trade or business. Petitioners\n\nhave also contended that amended Rule 9 also violates\n\nSection   3,   7   and   51   of   the   Aadhaar   Act.\nSection   3\n\nprovides for enrolment under Aadhaar scheme.\nSection 7\n\nprovides   for   requirement   of proof   of   Aadhaar   number\n\nfor   receipt   of   certain   subsidies,   benefits

  It is further submitted that Amendment Rules are\n\nalso     ultra   vires   to   the   PMLA,   2002.   Shri   Arvind   P\nDatar   has   also   referred   to   judgment   of   the   U.K.\n\nSupreme   Court   in  Bank   Mellat   v.   Her   Majesty’s\n\nTreasury,   (2013)   UKSC   39.  He   has   relied   on   principle\n\nof proportionality as summed in paragraph 20 which is\n\nto the following effect:\n\n“20....The classic formulation of the test is\nto   be   found   in   the   advice   of   the   Privy\nCouncil,   delivered   by   Lord   Clyde,   in   De\nFreitas v Permanent Secretary of Ministry of\nAgriculture,   Fisheries,   Lands   and   Housing\n[1999]   1   AC   69   at   80.\nBut   this   decision,\nalthough   it   was   a   milestone   in   the\ndevelopment of the law, is now more important\nfor the way in which it has been adapted and\napplied in the subsequent case­law, notably\nR\n(Daly)   v   Secretary   of   State\nfor   the   Home\nDepartment [2001] 2 AC 532 (in particular the\nspeech of Lord Steyn), R v Shayler [2003] 1\nAC   247   at   paras   57­59   (Lord   Hope   of\nCraighead),   Huang   v   Secretary   of   State   for\nthe Home Department [2007] 2 AC 167 at para\n19 (Lord Bingham of Cornhill) and R (Quila) v\nSecretary   of   State   for   the   Home   Department\n[2012] 1 AC 621 at para 45.  Their effect can\nbe   sufficiently   summarised   for   present\npurposes by saying that the question depends\non   an   exacting   analysis   of   the   factual   case\nadvanced in defence of the measure, in order\nto   determine   (i)   whether   its   objective   is\nsufficiently   important   to   justify   the\nlimitation   of   a   fundamental   right;   (ii)\nwhether   it   is   rationally   connected   to   the\nobjective;   (iii)   whether   a   less   intrusive\nmeasure   could   have   been   used;   and   (iv)\nwhether,   having   regard   to   these   matters   and\nto   the   severity   of   the   consequences,   a   fair\nbalance has been struck between the rights of\nthe   individual   and   the   interests   of   the\ncommunity.  These   four   requirements   are\nlogically   separate,   but   in   practice   they\ninevitably overlap because the same facts are\nlikely   to   be   relevant   to   more   than   one   of\nthem.”(emphasis added)\n\n323.   The  principles of  proportionality  as  noticed  in\n\nthe   aforesaid   judgment   are   substantially   same   which\n\nhad   been   laid   down   in\nPuttaswamy\ncase  and\nModern\n\nDental\n(supra)  only   one   difference   in   the   above   two\n\njudgments is that although both the judgments noticed\n\nthe   least   intrusive   test   but   in   ultimate   conclusion\n\nthe   said   test   was   not   reflected   in   the   ratio   of   the\n\nabove two judgments.\n\n324.\nIn   the   foregoing   discussions,   we   come   to   the\n\nconclusion that Rule 9 of Second Amendment Rules, 2017\n\nfully   satisfies   three­fold   test   as\nlaid   down   in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase  and   the   submission   that   the   Rule   is\n\nunconstitutional has to be rejected.   We answer Issue\n\nNo. 14 in the following manner:­\n\nAns.14:­ Rule 9 as amended by PMLA (Second Amendment)\n\nRules, 2017 is not unconstitutional and does\n\nnot violate\nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n, 21\n\n& 300A\nof the Constitution and Sections 3, 7 & 51 of\n\nthe  Aadhaar  Act.    Further  Rule  9  as  amended\n\nis not ultra vires to\nPMLA Act, 2002\n.\n\nIssue No. 15 Circular   dated   23.03.2017   issued   by\nMinistry   of   Communications,   Department\nof Telecommunications\n\n325.   The petitioners have attacked the circular dated\n\n23.03.2017   and   submitted   that   the   circular   is   ultra\n\nvires.     By   circular   dated   23.03.2017,   Department   of\n\nTelecommunications   has   directed   that   all   licensees\n\nshall   re­verify   all   existing   mobile   subscribers\n\n(prepaid   and   postpaid)   through   Aadhaar   based   e­kyc\n\nprocess.     Petitioners   submitted   that   linking   the   sim\n\nwith   Aadhaar   number   is   breach   of   privacy   violating\n\nArticle   21\nof   the   Constitution.     Elaborating   their\n\nchallenge,   it   is   contended   that   circular   dated\n\n23.03.2017 is not covered by any of the provisions of\n\nAadhaar   Act   neither\nSection   7\nnor\nSection   57\n.\n\nCircular dated 23.03.2017 is not a law under Part III\n\nof   the   Constitution   and   thus   same   cannot   put   any\n\nrestriction   on   privacy   right.     It   is   submitted   that\ncircular dated 23.03.2017 does not satisfy three­fold\n\ntest as\nlaid down in\nPrivacy judgment.\n\n326.   Learned   counsel   for   the   respondents   justifying\n\nthe linking of Aadhaar with sim card submits that non­\n\nverifying   sim   cards,   have   caused   serious   security\n\nthreats,   which   has   been   noticed   by   this   Court   in\n\nseveral   judgments.     It   is   submitted   that   circular\n\ndated   23.03.2017   was   issued   on   the   basis   of\n\nrecommendation   of   Telecom   Regulatory   Authority   of\n\nIndia.     Respondents   further   submits   that   circular\n\ndated 23.03.2017 has been issued in reference to this\n\nCourt's   direction   in\nLokniti   Foundation   Vs.   Union   of\n\nIndia   and   Another\n,   (2017)   7   SCC   155.     This   court\n\nhaving approved the action, no exception can be taken\n\nby   the   petitioner   to   the   circular   dated   23.03.2017.\n\nIt is submitted that the Central Government, which has\n\nright to  grant  license can  always put a condition in\n\nthe   license   obliging   the   licensee   to   verify   the   sim\n\ncards under the Aadhaar verification.   To impose such\n\ncondition   is   in   the   statutory   power   granted   to   the\n\nGovernment   under\nSection   4\nof   the   Indian   Telegraph\nAct, 1885.\n\n327.   We   need   to   scrutinise   the   circular   dated\n\n23.03.2017   on   the   ground   of   attack   alleged   by   the\n\npetitioners   and   justification   as   offered   by   the\n\nrespondents.     Circular   dated   23.03.2017   has   been\n\naddressed   by   the   Ministry   of   Communications,\n\nDepartment   of   Telecommunications   to   all     Unified\n\nLicensees/Unified   Access   Service   Licensees/Cellular\n\nMobile   Telephone   Service   Licensees   with   subject:\n\nimplementation   of   orders   of   Supreme   Court   regarding\n\n100%   E­KYC   of   existing   subscribers.     Para   1   to   3   of\n\nthe   circular   may   be   noticed,   which   are   to   the\n\nfollowing effect:­\n\n“Hon'ble   Supreme   Court,   in   its   order\ndated 06.02.2017 passed in Writ Petition\n(C)  No.   607/2016   filed   by\nLokniti\nFoundation   v/s   Union   of   India\n,   while\ntaking into cognizance of \"Aadhaar based\nE­KYC  process  for issuing  new  telephone\nconnection\"  issued   by   the   Department,\nhas   inter­alia   observed   that  \"an\neffective process has been  evolved to ensure\nidentity   verification,   as   well   as,   the\naddresses of all mobile phone subscribers  for\nnew subscribers. In the near future, and more\nparticularly,   within   one   year   from   today,   a\nsimilar   verification   will   be   completed,   in\ncase of existing subscribers.\"  This amounts\nto a  direction which is to be completed\nwithin a time frame of one year.\n\n2. A meeting was held on 13.02.2017 in\nthe Department with the telecom industry\nwherein   UIDAI,   TRAI   and   PMO\nrepresentatives   also   participated   to\ndiscuss the way forward to implement the\ndirections   of   Hon'ble   Supreme   Court.\n\nDetailed   discussions  and   deliberations\nwere   held   in   the   meeting.   The\nsuggestions   received   from   the   industry\nhave been examined in the Department.\n\n3. Accordingly,   after   taking   into\nconsideration   the   discussions   held   in\nthe   meeting   and   suggestions   received\nfrom   telecom   industry,   the   undersigned\nis   directed   to   convey  the   approval   of\ncompetent   authority   that   all   Licensees\nshall   re­verify   all   existing   mobile\nsubscribers   (prepaid   and   postpaid)\nthrough Aadhaar based E­KYC process as\nmentioned in this office letter no. 800­\n29/2010­VAS   dated   16.08.2016.   The\ninstructions  mentioned   in   subsequent\nparagraphs   shall   be   strictly   followed\nwhile   carrying   out   the  re­verification\nexercise.”\n328.   The   circular   of   the   Department   of\n\nTelecommunications directing   the   licensees   to\n\nmandatorily   verify   existing   sim   subscribers   in   turn\n\nresulted   in   mobile   telephone   service   licensees\n\ndirecting the subscribers to get their sim seeded with\n\nAadhaar.     Repeated   messages   and   directions   have   been\n\nissued by Cellular Mobile Telephone Service operators.\n\nCompulsory seeding of Aadhaar with mobile numbers has\n\nto be treated to be an intrusion in Privacy Right of a\n\nperson.  Any invasion on the Privacy Right of a person\n\nhas   to   be   backed   by   law   as   per   the three­fold   test\n\nenumerated in\nPuttaswamy\ncase (supra).  Existence of a\n\nlaw   is   the   foremost   condition   to   be   fulfilled   for\n\nrestricting any Privacy Right.  Thus, we have to first\n\nexamine whether circular dated 23.03.2017 can be said\n\nto be a 'law'.\n\n329.   The law as explained in\nArticle 13(3)\nhas to be\n\napplied   for   finding   out   as   to   what   is   law.\nArticle\n\n13(3)(a)\ngives   an   inclusive   definition   of   law   in\n\nfollowing words:­\n\n(a) “law” includes any Ordinance, order, bye­\nlaw,   rule,   regulation,   notification,   custom\nor usage having in the territory of India the\nforce of law;\n\n330.  The circular dated 23.03.2017 at best is only an\n\nexecutive   instruction   issued   on   23.03.2017   by   the\n\nMinistry   of   Communications,   Department   of\n\nTelecommunications.     The   circular   does   not   refer   to\n\nany statutory provision or statutory base for issuing\n\nthe circular.   The subject of circular as noted above\n\nindicate   that   circular   has   been   issued   for\n\nimplementation   of   orders   of   Supreme   Court   regarding\n\n100%   E­KYC   based   re­verification   of   existing\n\nsubscribers.     It   is   necessary   to   notice   the   judgment\n\nof   this   Court   dated   06.02.2017,   a   reference   to   which\n\nis   made   in   the   circular   itself.     The   order   dated\n\n06.02.2017 was issued by this Court in a Writ Petition\n\nfiled   by\nLokniti   Foundation   Vs.   Union   of   India   and\n\nAnother\n, (2017) 7 SCC 155.  The petitioners have filed\n\na   writ   petition   with   a   prayer   that   identity   of   each\n\nsubscriber and also the members should be verified so\n\nthat   unidentified  and   unverified   subscribers   cannot\n\nmisuse mobile phone.   After issuing the notice, Union\nof India had filed a counter affidavit, where Union of\n\nIndia   stated   that   Department   has   launched   Aadhaar\n\nbased   E­KYC   for   issuing   mobile   connections   on\n\n16.8.2016.\n\n331.   Paras 2 to 6 of the judgment, which is relevant\n\nfor the present purpose are as follows:­\n\n2. Consequent   upon   notice   being   issued   to\nthe Union of India, a short counter affidavit\nhas been filed on its behalf, wherein, it is\naverred as under:\n\n“22. That however, the department has\nlaunched   `Aadhaar   based   E­KYC   for\nissuing   mobile   connections'   on   16th\nAugust, 2016 wherein the customer as\nwell as Point of Sale (PoS) Agent of\nthe   TSP   will   be   authenticated   from\nUnique   Identification   Authority   of\nIndia   (UIDAI)   based   on   their\nbiometrics and their demographic data\nreceived from UIDAI is stored in the\ndatabase   of   TSP   along   with   time\nstamps.   Copy   of   letter   No.800­\n29/2010­VAS   dated   16.08.2016   is\nannexed   herewith   and   marked   as\nAnnexure R­1/10.\n\n23.   As   on   31.01.2017,   111.31   Crores\nAadhaar   card   has   been   issued   which\nrepresent   87.09%   of   populations.\n\nHowever, still there are substantial\nnumber   of   persons   who   do   not   have\nAadhaar card because they may not be\ninterested in having Aadhaar being 75\nyears or more of age or not availing\nany   benefit   of   pension   or   Direct\nBenefit   Transfer   (DBT).   Currently\nAadhaar   card   or   biometric\nauthentication   is   not   mandatory   for\nobtaining a new telephone connection.\n\nAs   a   point   of   information,   it   is\nsubmitted that those who have Aadhaar\ncard/number normally use the same for\nobtaining a new telephone connection\nusing   E­KYC   process   as   mobile\nconnection can be procured within few\nminutes   in   comparison   to   1­2   days\nbeing taken in normal course.\n\n24. That in this process, there will\nbe   almost   `NIL'   chances   of   delivery\nof   SIM   to   wrong   person   and   the\ntraceability   of   customer   shall\ngreatly   improve.   Further,   since   no\nseparate   document   for   Proof   of\nAddress or Proof of Identity will be\ntaken in this process, there will be\nno chances of forgery of documents.”\n\n3.   The   learned   Attorney   General,   in   his\nendeavour to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe   procedure,   which   has   been   put   in   place,\nhas invited our attention to the application\nform, which will be required to be filled up,\nby   new   mobile   subscribers,   using   e­KYC\nprocess. It was the submission of the learned\nAttorney   General,   that   the   procedure   now\nbeing   adopted,   will   be   sufficient   to\nalleviate   the   fears,   projected   in   the   writ\npetition.\n\n4.   Insofar   as   the   existing   subscribers   are\nconcerned, it was submitted on behalf of the\nUnion   of   India,   that   more   than   90%   of   the\nsubscribers   are   using   pre­paid   connections.\nIt   was   pointed   out,   that   each   pre­paid\nconnection holder, has to per force renew his\nconnection   periodically,   by  making   a   deposit\nfor   further   user.   It   was   submitted,   that\nthese   90%   existing   subscribers,   can   also   be\nverified   by   putting   in   place   a   mechanism,\nsimilar   to   the   one   adopted   for   new\nsubscribers. Learned Attorney General states,\nthat   an   effective   programme   for   the   same,\nwould   be   devised   at   the   earliest,   and   the\nprocess   of   identity   verification   will   be\ncompleted   within   one   year,   as   far   as\npossible.\n\n5. In view of the factual position brought to\nour   notice   during   the   course   of   hearing,   we\nare   satisfied,   that   the   prayers   made   in   the\nwrit   petition   have   been   substantially   dealt\nwith,   and   an   effective   process   has   been\nevolved   to   ensure   identity   verification,   as\nwell   as,   the   addresses   of   all   mobile   phone\nsubscribers for new subscribers. In the near\nfuture,   and   more   particularly, within   one\nyear from today, a similar verification will\nbe   completed,   in   the   case   of   existing\nsubscribers.   While   complimenting   the\npetitioner   for   filing   the   instant   petition,\nwe   dispose   of   the   same   with   the   hope   and\nexpectation,   that   the   undertaking   given   to\nthis Court, will be taken seriously, and will\nbe given effect to, as soon as possible.\n\n6.   The   instant   petition   is   disposed   of,   in\nthe above terms.”\n\n332.   Para   5   of   the   judgment   contains   the   operative\n\nportion of the order, which states \"we dispose of the\n\nsame   with   the   hope   and   expectation,   that   the\n\nundertaking   given   to   this   Court,   will   be   taken\nseriously,   and   will   be   given   effect   to,   as   soon   as\n\npossible”.  The order of this Court as extracted above\n\nitself  states that  the Court itself did not give any\n\ndirection   rather   noticed   the   stand   of   Union   of   India\n\nwhere it informed to the Court that the department has\n\nalready   launched   Aadhaar   based   e­KYC   for   issuing\n\nmobile  connections.   For  90 per cent of the existing\n\nsubscribers,   Attorney   General   has   stated   that   an\n\neffective   programme   would   be   devised   at   the   earliest\n\nand will be completed within one year.\n\n333.   We   are   clear   in   our   mind   that   this   Court   on\n\n06.02.2017   only   noticed   the   stand   of   the   Union   of\n\nIndia and disposed of the writ petition expecting that\n\nundertaking given to this Court shall be given effect\n\nto.\n\n334.   The circular dated 23.03.2017 cites the order of\n\nthis   Court   as   a   direction,   which   according   to\n\ndepartment   was   to   be   completed   within   the   time   frame\n\nof one year.  Circular further states that the meeting\n\nwas   held   on   13.02.2017   in   the   Department   with   the\ntelecom   industry   wherein   UIDAI,   TRAI   and   PMO\n\nrepresentatives also participated.\n\n335.   This Court thus in\nLokniti\ncase (supra)  did not\n\nexamine the Aadhaar based e­KYC process in context of\n\nright of privacy.  Thus, the order of this Court dated\n\n06.02.2017   cannot   absolve   the   Government   from\n\njustifying its circular as per law.\n\n336.  One of the submissions, which has been raised by\n\nthe   respondents   to   cite   a   statutory   base   to   the\n\ncircular   is   that   the   circular   has   been   issued   in\n\npursuance of recommendation made by TRAI under\nSection\n\n11(1)(a)\nof   TRAI   Act,   1997.\nSection   11\nof   the   TRAI\n\nAct, 1997   provides for function of authority\nSection\n\n11(1)(a)\n:­\n\n(a)  make recommendations, either suo motu or\non   a   request   from   the   licensor,   on   the\nfollowing matters, namely:—\n\n(i)   need   and   timing   for   introduction   of\nnew service provider;\n\n(ii)   terms and conditions of licence to\na service provider;\n\n(iii)     revocation   of   licence   for   non­\ncompliance   of   terms   and   conditions   of\nlicence;\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n337.   One   of   the   functions   of   the   TRAI   is   to   give\n\nrecommendations as per\nSection 11(1)(a)\non the matters\n\nenumerated therein.   The recommendations of TRAI were\n\nonly   recommendations   and   the   mere   fact   that   circular\n\ndated   23.03.2017   was   issued   after   the   recommendation\n\nwas   sent   by   TRAI,   circular   dated   23.03.2017   does   not\n\nacquire   any   statutory   character.     Circular   dated\n\n23.03.2017 thus cannot be held to be a law within the\n\nmeaning of Part III of the Constitution.\n\n338.   Shri   Rakesh   Dwivedi,   learned   counsel   appearing\n\nfor   the   respondents   has   submitted   that   the   Central\n\nGovernment   being   licensor,   it   is   fully   entitled   to\n\nprovide   for   any   condition   in   its   license,   which\n\ncondition becomes binding on the licensee.   Referring\n\nto   license   agreement   for   Unified   Licensees,   Shri\n\nDwivedi   submits   that   one   of   the   conditions   in   the\n\nagreement   was   Condition   No.   16.1   which   is   to   the\n\nfollowing effect:­\n\n\"16.1     The   Licensee   shall   be   bound   by   the\nterms   and   conditions   of   this   License\nAgreement   as   well   as   instructions   as   are\nissued   by   the   Licensor   and   by   such\norders/directions/regulations   of   TRAI   as   per\nprovisions   of   the\nTRAI   Act,   1997\nas   amended\nfrom time to time.”\n\n339.   Shri   Dwivedi   has   also   relied   on   a   number   of\n\njudgments   in   support   of   his   submissions   that\n\nconditions can be validly laid down.  he has relied on\n\nBagalkot   Cement   Co.   Ltd.   Vs.   R.K.   Pathan   and   Others\n,\n\nAIR   1963   SC   439,   where   this   Court   while   considering\n\nthe\nIndustrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946\n\nobserved   that   object   of   the   Act   was   to   require   the\n\nemployers to make the conditions of employment precise\n\nand   definite   and   the   Act   ultimately   intended   to\n\nprescribe   these   conditions   in   the   form   of   Standing\n\nOrders so that what used to be governed by a contract\n\nherebefore   would   now   be   governed   by   the   Statutory\n\nStanding Orders.\n\n340.   The  above  judgment at  best can be  read to  mean\n\nthat conditions, which are enumerated in the Standing\n\nOrders become statutory conditions.  No benefit of the\n\njudgment   can   be   taken   by   the   respondents   in   the\npresent case since even if it is put in the condition\n\nin the agreement between licensee and subscribers that\n\nlicensee   shall   be   bound   to   instructions   as   issued   by\n\nlicensor, the said condition does not become statutory\n\nnor take shape of a law.\nSukhdev Singh and Others Vs.\n\nBhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and Another\n, (1975)\n\n1 SCC 421 was relied, where this Court held that rules\n\nand

There\n\ncannot be any denial that rules framed under statutory\n\nprovisions will have force of law, thus, this\ncase has\n\nno   application\n.\n\nSimilarly, reliance   on\nLily

 Shri Dwivedi has also relied on judgment of this\n\nCourt in\nUnion of India and Another Vs. Association of\n\nUnified Telecom Service Providers of India and Others\n,\n\n(2011) 10 SCC 543.   This Court referring to\nSection 4\n\nof the Telegraph Act laid down following in paragraph\n\n39:­\n\n“39.   The   proviso   to   Sub­section   (1)   of\n\nSection   4\nof   the   Telegraph   Act,   however,\nenables   the   Central   Government   to   part   with\nthis   exclusive   privilege   in   favour   of   any\nother   person   by   granting   a   license   in   his\nfavour   on   such   conditions   and   in\nconsideration   of   such   payments   as   it   thinks\nfit.   As   the   Central   Government   owns   the\nexclusive   privilege   of   carrying   on\ntelecommunication activities   and   as   the\nCentral   Government   alone   has   the   right   to\npart   with   this   privilege   in   favour   of   any\nperson by granting a license in his favour on\nsuch conditions and in consideration of such\nterms   as   it   thinks   fit,   a   license   granted\nunder proviso to Sub­section (1) of\nSection 4\n\nof   the   Telegraph   Act   is   in   the   nature   of   a\ncontract   between   the   Central   Government   and\nthe licensee.”\n\n342.   There cannot be any dispute to the right of the\n\nCentral Government to part with exclusive privilege in\n\nfavour   of   any   person   by   granting   license   on   such   a\n\ncondition   and   in   consideration   of   such   terms   as   it\nthinks   fit.     But   mere   issuing   an   instruction   to   the\n\nlicensees   to   adopt   mandatory   process   of   e­KYC   by\n\nAadhaar   verification   in   no   manner   exalt   the\n\ninstructions   or   directives   as   a   law.     Circular   dated\n\n23.03.2017,   thus,   cannot   be   held   to   be   a   law   and\n\ndirection   to   re­verification   of   all   existing   mobile\n\nsubscribers through Aadhaar based e­KYC cannot be held\n\nto be backed by law, hence cannot be upheld.\n\n343.   There   is   one   more aspect   of   the   matter,   which\n\nneeds   to   be   looked   into.     Aadhaar   Act   has   only   two\n\nprovisions   under   which   Aadhaar   can   be   used,   i.e.\n\nSection   7\nand\nSection   57\n.     Present   is   not   a   case   of\n\nSection 7\nsince present is not a case of receiving any\n\nsubsidy,   benefit   or   service.     What\nSection   57\n\ncontemplate is that \"use of Aadhaar can be provided by\n\na law\".  Words \"by a law\" used in\nSection 57\nobviously\n\nmean   a   valid   law   framed   by   competent   legislation   and\n\nother than the Aadhaar Act.  No law has been framed by\n\npermitting   use   of   Aadhaar   for   verification   of   sim   of\n\nexisting   subscribers.     There   being   no   law   framed   for\n\nsuch use of Aadhaar,\nSection 57\nis also not attracted.\n344.   There   are   only   above   two   contingencies,   where\n\nAadhaar   can   be   used   and circular   dated   23.03.2017\n\nbeing   not   covered   by   any   of   above   contingencies,\n\ncircular dated 23.03.2017 deserves to be set aside.\n\nAns.15:­  Circular   dated   23.03.2017   being\n\nunconstitutional is set aside.\n\nIssue No. 16 Whether Aadhaar Act is a Money Bill and\ndecision   of   Speaker   certifying   it   as\nMoney   Bill   is   not   subject   to   Judicial\nReview of this Court?\n\n345.  The Aadhaar Act has been passed by Parliament as\n\nMoney   Bill.     Shri   P.   Chidambaram,   learned   senior\n\ncounsel   appearing   for   the   petitioners   contends   that\n\nAadhaar Act  is not a Money Bill, it being not covered\n\nby   any   of   the   Clauses   under\nArticle   110\nof   the\n\nConstitution   of   India.     He   further   submits   that\n\ndecision   of   the   Speaker   certifying   Aadhaar   Bill   as\n\nMoney   Bill   being   illegal   and   contrary   to   the   express\n\nconstitutional   provisions   deserves   to   be   interfered\n\nwith and such decision of the Speaker is also subject\n\nto   Judicial   Review   by   this   Court.     The   word   “only”\nused in\nArticle 110\nhas significance and a Bill, which\n\ndoes   not   contain   only,   the   provisions   pertaining   to\n\nClause   (a)   to   (f)   cannot   be   regarded   as   Money   Bill.\n\nRespondents cannot fall   on Clause (g) to support the\n\nMoney Bill, which clause cannot be invoked unless the\n\nprovisions  of Bill  are covered  by any of  the clauses\n\nfrom (a) to (f).\n\n346.   Shri   K.K.   Venugopal,   learned   Attorney   General\n\nrefuting   the   above   submission   submits   that   Aadhaar\n\nBill   has   correctly   been   passed   as   Money   Bill.     He\n\nsubmits that the certification granted by Speaker that\n\nAadhaar   Bill   is   a   Money   Bill   has   been   made   final   by\n\nvirtue   of\nArticle   110(3)\n,   hence   it   cannot   be\n\nquestioned   in   any   Court.     The   decision   of   Speaker\n\ncertifying   the   Bill   as   Money   Bill   is   not   subject   to\n\nJudicial   Review.     It   is   further   submitted   by   learned\n\nAttorney General that even on looking the Aadhaar Bill\n\non   merits,   it   satisfies   the   conditions   as   enumerated\n\nunder\nArticle 110(1).\nHe submits that Aadhaar Bill is\n\nclearly   referable   to   Clause(c),   Clause(e)   and\n\nClause(g)   of\nArticle   110(1).\nHe   submits   that   the\nheart   of   the   Aadhaar   Act   is\nSection   7\nwhich   is   with\n\nregard   to   payment   of   subsidies,   benefits   or   services\n\nand   for   which   the   expenditure   is   incurred   form   the\n\nConsolidated   Fund   of   India.\nArticle   122\nalso   puts   an\n\nembargo in questioning validity of any proceedings in\n\nParliament.     Certification   of   Bill   as   Money   Bill   is\n\nmatter   of   Parliamentary   procedure   hence\nArticle   122\n\nalso save\nthe said decision\nfrom being questioned in a\n\nCourt of Law.\n\n347.\nArticle   110\nand\nArticle   122\n,   which   falls   for\n\nconsideration in the present case are as follows:­\n\n“110. Definition of \"Money Bills\".­\n(1) For the purposes of this Chapter, a Bill\nshall   be   deemed   to   be   a   Money   Bill   if   it\ncontains only provisions dealing with all or\nany of the following matters, namely:­\n\n(a)   the   imposition,   abolition,\nremission,   alteration   or   regulation\nof any tax;\n\n(b)   the   regulation   of   the   borrowing\nof   money   or   the   giving   of   any\nguarantee by the Government of India,\nor   the   amendment   of   the   law   with\nrespect to any financial obligations\nundertaken or to be undertaken by the\nGovernment of India;\n\n(c)   the   custody   of   the   Consolidated\nFund   or   the   Contingency   Fund   of\nIndia, the payment of moneys into or\nthe   withdrawal   of   moneys   from   any\nsuch Fund;\n\n(d)   the   appropriation   of   moneys   out\nof the Consolidated Fund of India;\n\n(e) the declaring of any expenditure\nto   be   expenditure   charged on   the\nConsolidated   Fund   of   India   or   the\nincreasing of the amount of any such\nexpenditure;\n\n(f)   the   receipt   of   money   on   account\nof the Consolidated Fund of India or\nthe   public   account   of   India   or

of\nthe matters specified in sub­clauses\n\n(a) to (f).\n\n(2) A Bill shall not be deemed to be a Money\nBill by reason only that it provides for the\nimposition   of   fines   or   other   pecuniary\npenalties,   or   for   the   demand   or   payment   of\nfees   for   licences   or   fees   for   services\nrendered,   or   by   reason   that   it   provides   for\nthe   imposition,   abolition,   remission,\nalteration   or   regulation   of   any   tax   by   any\nlocal authority or body for local purposes.\n\n(3) If any question arises whether a Bill is\na   Money   Bill   or   not,   the   decision   of   the\nSpeaker   of   the   House   of   the   People   thereon\nshall be final.\n\n4)   There   shall   be   endorsed   on   every   Money\nBill when it is transmitted to the Council of\nStates   under\narticle   109\n,   and   when   it   is\npresented   to   the   President   for   assent   under\n\narticle   111\n,   the   certificate   of   the   Speaker\nof the House of the People signed by him that\nit is a Money Bill.\n122.   Courts   not   to   inquire   into   proceedings\nof   Parliament.­(1)   The   validity   of   any\nproceedings in Parliament shall not be called\nin   question   on   the   ground   of   any   alleged\nirregularity of procedure.\n\n(2)   No   officer   or   member   of   Parliament   in\nwhom  powers   are   vested   by   or   under   this\nConstitution  for   regulating  procedure   or   the\nconduct   of   business,   or   for   maintaining\norder, in Parliament shall be subject to the\njurisdiction   of   any   court   in   respect   of   the\nexercise by him of those powers.”\n\n348.   We   need   to   first   advert   to   the   submission\n\npertaining   to   question   as   to   whether   decision   of\n\nSpeaker   certifying   the   Bill   as   Money   Bill   is   subject\n\nto  Judicial Review  of this  Court  or being related to\n\nonly procedure, is immuned from Judicial Review under\n\nArticle   122.\n\nArticle   110(3)\ngives   finality   to   the\n\ndecision of the Speaker of the House of the People on\n\nquestion   as   to   whether   a   Bill   is   Money   Bill   or   not.\n\nThe   word   occurring   in   sub­article   (3)   of\nArticle   110\n\nare “shall be final”.\nArticle 122(1)\nputs an embargo\n\non   questioning   the   validity   of   any   proceeding   in   the\n\nParliament  on   the   ground   of   any   alleged   irregularity\n\nor   procedure.     The   Constitution   uses   different\n\nexpressions   in   different   articles   like   “shall   be\nfinal”,   “shall   not   be   questioned”,   “shall   not   be\n\nquestioned in any Court of Law” etc.\n\n349.   This   Court has   examined   the   scope   of   Judicial\n\nReview   in   reference   to   Parliamentary   proceedings.     A\n\nsimilar   Constitutional   provision   giving   finality   to\n\nthe decision of the Speaker is contained in Para 6 of\n\nTenth   Schedule   where   a   question   whether   a   person   has\n\nbecome   disqualified   or   not   is   to   be   referred   to   the\n\ndecision   of   the   Chairman   or   the   Speaker   and   his\n\ndecision   shall   be   final.     Para   6   sub­clause(1)   is\n\nquoted as below:­\n\n“6.   Decision   on   questions   as   to\ndisqualification on ground of defection.— (1)\nIf any question arises as to whether a member\nof   a   House   has   become   subject   to\ndisqualification   under   this   Schedule,   the\nquestion   shall   be   referred   for   the   decision\nof the Chairman or, as the case may be, the\nSpeaker of such House and his decision shall\nbe final:\n\nProvided   that   where   the   question   which\nhas  arisen  is  as   to  whether  the  Chairman   or\nthe Speaker of a House has become subject to\nsuch   disqualification,   the   question  shall   be\nreferred   for   the   decision   of   such   member   of\nthe   House   as   the   House   may   elect   in   this\nbehalf and his decision shall be final.”\n350.   The  Constitution  Bench had occasion  to consider\n\nPara   6   in\nKihoto   Hollohan   Vs.   Zachillhu   and   Others\n,\n\n1992   Supp.   (2)   SCC   651,   Justice   M.N.   Venkatachaliah,\n\nas   he   then   was   elaborately   considered   the   rival\n\ncontentions.   It was also contended before this Court\n\nthat   in   view   of   the   finality   of   the   decision   of   the\n\nSpeaker in Para 6 of Tenth Schedule, the  decision of\n\nthe   Speaker   is   beyond   Judicial   Review.     In   Para   78,\n\nfollowing has been stated:­\n\n“78.   These   two   contentions   have   certain\noverlapping   areas   between   them   and   admit   of\nbeing dealt with together. Paragraph 6(1) of\nthe   Tenth   Schedule   seeks   to   impart   a\nstatutory   finality   to   the   decision   of   the\nSpeaker   or   the   Chairman.   The   argument   is\nthat,   this   concept   of   `finality'   by   itself,\nexcludes   Courts'   jurisdiction.   Does  the  word\n\"final\"   render   the   decision   of   the   Speaker\nimmune   from   Judicial   Review?   It   is   now   well\naccepted   that   a   finality   clause   is   not   a\nlegislative   magical   incantation   which   has\nthat   effect   of   telling   off   Judicial   Review.\n\nStatutory   finality   of   a  decision   presupposes\nand   is   subject   to   its   consonance   with   the\nstatute...............”\n\nIn Para 80 to 85, following has been held:­\n\n80.\nIn\nDurga   Shankar   Mehta   v.   Raghuraj\nSingh\n,   AIR   1954   SC   520   the   order   of   the\nElection   Tribunal   was   made   final   and\nconclusive   by\nSection   105\nof   the\nRepresentation   of   the   People   Act,   1951.   The\ncontention   was   that   the   finality   and\nconclusiveness   clauses   barred   the\njurisdiction   of   the   Supreme   Court   under\nArticle 136. This contention was repelled. It\nwas observed: (AIR p. 522)\n...[B]ut once it is held that it is a\njudicial   tribunal   empowered   and\nobliged   to   deal   judicially   with\ndisputes   arising   out   of   or   in\nconnection   with   election,   the\noverriding   power   of   this   Court   to\ngrant special leave, in proper cases,\nwould certainly be attracted and this\npower   cannot   be   excluded   by   any\nparliamentary legislation.\n\n...   But   once   that   Tribunal   has   made\nany determination or adjudication on\nthe matter, the powers of this Court\nto interfere by way of special leave\ncan always be exercised......\n\n...   The   powers   given   by\nArticle   136\n\nof   the   Constitution   however   are   in\nthe   nature   of   special   or   residuary\npowers which are exercisable outside\nthe purview of ordinary law, in cases\nwhere   the   needs   of   justice   demand\ninterference by the Supreme Court of\nthe land....\n\nSection   105\nof   the\nRepresentation   of   the   People   Act\ncertainly   gives   finality   to   the\ndecision of the Election Tribunal so\nfar as that Act is concerned and does\nnot   provide   for   any   further   appeal\nbut that cannot in any way cut down\nor effect the overriding powers which\nthis Court can exercise in the matter\nof   granting   special   leave   under\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution.\n\n81. Again, in\nUnion of India v. Jyoti Prakash\nMitter\n[1971]   3   SCR   483   a   similar   finality\nclause in\nArticle 217(3)\nof the Constitution\ncamp   up   for   consideration.   This   Court   said:\n\n(SCC pp.410­1, Para32)\n...The President acting under\nArticle\n217(3)\nperforms   a   judicial   function\nof grave importance under the scheme\nof our Constitution. He cannot act on\nthe   advice   of   his   Ministers.\n\nNotwithstanding the declared finality\nof   the   order   of   the   President   the\nCourt has jurisdiction in appropriate\ncases to set aside the order, if it\nappears   that   it   was   passed   on\ncollateral   considerations   or   the\nrules   of   natural   justice   were   not\nobserved,   or   that   the   President's\njudgment   was   coloured   by   the   advice\nor   representation   made   by   the\nexecutive   or   it   was   founded   on   no\nevidence.\"\n\n82.     Referring   to   the   expression   \"final\"\n\noccurring   in   Article   311(3)   of   the\nConstitution this Court in Union of India v.\n\nTulsiram Patel, [1985] Supp. 2 SCR 131 held:\n\n(SCC p.507. Para 138)\n...The   finality   given   by   Clause   (3)\nof\nArticle   311\nto   the   disciplinary\nauthority's decision that it was not\nreasonably   practicable   to   hold   the\ninquiry   is   not   binding   upon   the\ncourt.   The   court   will   also   examine\nthe   charge   of   mala   fides,   if   any,\nmade   in   the   writ   petition.   In\nexamining   the   relevancy   of   the\nreasons, the court will consider the\nsituation   which   according   to   the\ndisciplinary   authority   made   it   come\nto   the   conclusion   that   it   was   not\nreasonably   practicable   to   hold   the\ninquiry. If the court finds that the\nreasons   are   irrelevant,   then   the\nrecording of its satisfaction by the\ndisciplinary   authority   would   be   an\nabuse   of   power   conferred   upon   it   by\nClause (b)....\n\n83.   If   the   intendment   is   to   exclude   the\njurisdiction   of   the   superior   Courts,   the\nlanguage   would   quite   obviously   have   been\ndifferent.   Even   so,   where   such   exclusion   is\nsought   to   be   effected   by   an   amendment   the\nfurther   question   whether   such   an   amendment\nwould   be   destructive   of   a   basic   feature   of\nthe  Constitution   would   arise.   But   comparison\nof the language in\nArticle 363(1)\nwould bring\nout in contrast the kind of language that may\nbe necessary to achieve any such purpose.\n\n84. In\nBrundaban Nayak v. Election Commission\nof   India\n[1965]   3   SCR   53,   in   spite   of\nfinality   attached   by\nArticle   192\nto   the\ndecision   of   the   Governor   in   respect   of\ndisqualification incurred   by   a   member   of   a\nState Legislature subsequent to the election,\nthe  matter  was   examined  by   this  Court  on   an\nappeal by special leave under\nArticle 136\nof\nthe Constitution against the decision of the\nHigh Court dismissing the writ petition filed\nunder\nArticle   226\nof   the   Constitution.\n\nSimilarly in\nUnion of India v. Jyoti Prakash\nMitter\n[1971] 3 SCR 483, in spite of finality\nattached   to   the   order   of   the   President   with\nregard to the determination of age of a Judge\nof the High Court under\nArticle 217(3)\nof the\nConstitution,   this   Court   examined   the\nlegality of the order passed by the President\nduring the pendency of an appeal filed under\n\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution.\n\n85.   There   is   authority   against   the\nacceptability   of   the   argument   that   the   word\n\"final\"   occurring   in   Paragraph   6(1)   has   the\neffect   of   excluding   the   jurisdiction   of   the\nCourts in\nArticles 136\n, 226\nand 227.”\n\n351.   The   above   Constitution   Bench   Judgment   clearly\n\nsupport   the   case   of   the petitioners   that   finality\n\nattached to the decision of the Speaker under\nArticle\n\n110(3)\ndoes   not   inhibit   the   Court   in   exercising   its\n\nJudicial Review. We may also refer to the Constitution\n\nBench judgment of this Court in Special Reference No.\n\n1   of   1964,   AIR   1965   SC   745   where   this   Court   had\n\noccasion to consider\nArticle 212\n, which is a provision\n\nrelating to the legislature of the State  para materia\n\nto\nArticle 122.\nConstitution Bench has held that what\n\nis   protected   under\nArticle   212\nfrom   being   questioned\n\nis   on   the   ground   of  any   alleged   irregularity   or\n\nprocedure.   The said ground does not apply in case of\n\nillegality   of   the   decision.     The   next   case,   which\n\nneeds   to   be   considered   is   again   a   Constitution   Bench\n\njudgment   of   this   Court   in  Raja   Rampal   Vs.   Hon'ble\n\nSpeaker, Lok Sabha and Others, (2007) 3 SCC 184.   The\n\nConstitution   Bench\nin\nthe   above   case\nhad   occasion   to\nconsider the question of issue of Judicial Review of a\n\ndecision   of   Speaker   disqualifying   from   membership   of\n\nthe   Parliament.     A   submission   was   raised   before   the\n\nCourt   by   virtue   of\nArticle   122\nof   the   Constitution,\n\nwhich puts an embargo on questioning any proceeding of\n\nthe Parliament, the decision of the Speaker is immuned\n\nfrom   the   Judicial   Review.   The   above   submission   has\n\nbeen noticed in Para 364 of the judgment in following\n\nwords:­\n\n“364. The submissions of the learned Counsel\nfor   the   Union   of   India   and   the   learned\nAdditional Solicitor General seek us to read\na   finality   clause   in   the   provisions   of\n\nArticle   122(1)\nin   so   far   as   parliamentary\nproceedings are concerned. On the subject of\nfinality clauses and their effect on power of\njudicial review, a number of cases have been\nreferred   that   may   be   taken   note   of   at   this\nstage. ”\n\n352.  In Paras 376, 377, 384 and 386 following has been\n\nheld:­\n\n“376.   In   our   considered   view,   the   principle\nthat   is   to   be   taken   note   of   in   the\naforementioned   series   of   cases   is   that\nnotwithstanding   the   existence   of   finality\nclauses,   this   Court   exercised   its\njurisdiction   of  judicial   review  whenever   and\nwherever   breach   of   fundamental rights   was\nalleged.   The   President   of   India   while\ndetermining the question of age of a Judge of\na   High   Court   under\nArticle   217(3)\n,   or   the\nPresident   of   India   (or   the   Governor,   as   the\ncase   may   be)   while   taking   a   decision   under\n\nArticle   311(3)\nto   dispense   with   the\nordinarily mandatory inquiry before dismissal\nor   removal   of   a   civil   servant,   or   for   that\nmatter   the   Speaker   (or   the   Chairman,   as   the\ncase   may   be)   deciding   the   question   of\ndisqualification under   Para   6   of   the   Tenth\nSchedule   may   be   acting   as   authorities\nentrusted   with   such   jurisdiction   under   the\nconstitutional provisions. Yet, the manner in\nwhich they exercised the said jurisdiction is\nnot   wholly   beyond   the   judicial   scrutiny.   In\nthe   case   of   the   Speaker   exercising\njurisdiction   under   the   Tenth   Schedule,   the\nproceedings   before   him   are   declared   by   Para\n6(2) of the Tenth Schedule to be proceedings\nin   Parliament   within   the   meaning   of   Article\n\n122.   Yet,   the   said   jurisdiction   was   not\naccepted as non­justifiable. In this view, we\nare   unable   to   subscribe   to   the   proposition\nthat there is absolute immunity available to\nthe   Parliamentary   proceedings   relating   to\n\nArticle   105(3).\nIt   is   a   different   matter   as\nto   what   parameters,   if   any,   should   regulate\nor   control   the   judicial   scrutiny   of   such\nproceedings.\n\n377. In U.P. Assembly case (Special Reference\nNo.1 of 1964), AIR 1965 SC 745, the issue was\nauthoritatively settled by this Court, and it\nwas  held,  at  SCR   pp.  455­56,   as  under:  (AIR\np.768, para 62)\n“Article   212(1)   seems   to   make   it\npossible   for   a   citizen   to call   in\nquestion in the appropriate court of\nlaw   the   validity   of   any   proceedings\ninside   the   legislative   chamber   if\nhis   case   is   that the   said\nproceedings   suffer   not   from   mere\nirregularity   of   procedure,   but   from\nan   illegality.  If   the   impugned\nprocedure   is   illegal   and\nunconstitutional, it would be open to\nbe   scrutinized   in   a   court   of   law,\nthough such scrutiny is prohibited if\nthe   complaint   against   the   procedure\nis   no   more   than   this   that   the\nprocedure was irregular.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n384.   The   prohibition   contained in\nArticle\n122(1)\ndoes not provide immunity in cases of\nillegalities.\nIn   this   context,   reference   may\nalso   be   made   to\nSarojini   Ramaswami   v.   Union\nof   India\n,  (1992)  4  SCC   506.  The  case   mainly\npertained   to\nArticle   124(4)\nread   with   the\n\nJudges   (Inquiry)   Act,   1968\n.   While   dealing,\ninter alia, with the overriding effect of the\nrules   made   under\nArticle   124(5)\nover   the\nrules   made   under\nArticle   118\n,   this   Court   at\npp.   187­88   made   the   following   observations:\n\n(SCC p. 572, para 94)\n“94.     We   have   already   indicated   the\nconstitutional   scheme   in   India   and\nthe true import of clauses(4) and (5)\nof\nArticle   124\nread   with   the   law\nenacted under\nArticle 124(5)\n, namely,\nthe\nJudges   (Inquiry)   Act,   1968\nand\nthe   Judges   (Inquiry)   Rules,   1969,\nwhich,   inter   alia   contemplate   the\nprovision   for   an   opportunity   to   the\nJudge concerned to show cause against\nthe finding of 'guilty' in the report\nbefore   Parliament   takes   it   up   for\nconsideration   along   with   the   motion\nfor   his   removal.   Along   with   the\ndecision   in   U.P.   Assembly   Case\n(Special Reference No. 1 of 1964) has\nto   be   read   the   declaration   made   in\nSub­Committee   on   Judicial\nAccountability,   (1991)   4   SCC   699\nthat 'a law made under\nArticle 124(5)\n\nwill   override   the   rules   made   under\n\nArticle   118\nand   shall   be   binding   on\nboth   the   Houses   of   Parliament.  A\nviolation   of   such   a   law   would\nconstitute   illegality   and   could   not\nbe   immune   from   judicial   scrutiny\nunder\nArticle   122(1).'\nThe   scope   of\npermissible   challenge   by   the   Judge\nconcerned   to   the   order   of   removal\nmade   by   the   President   under\nArticle\n124(4)\nin   the   judicial   review\navailable   after   making   of   the   order\nof   removal   by   the   President will   be\ndetermined on these considerations.”\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n386.\nArticle   122(1)\nthus   must   be   found   to\ncontemplate   the   twin   test   of   legality   and\nconstitutionality   for   any   proceedings   within\nthe   four   walls   of   Parliament.   The   fact   that\nthe   U.P.   Assembly   case   (Special   Reference\nNo.1 of 1964) dealt with the exercise of the\npower of the House beyond its four walls does\nnot   affect   this   view   which   explicitly\ninterpreted   a   constitutional   provision\ndealing   specifically   with   the   extent   of\njudicial   review   of   the   internal   proceedings\nof   the   legislative   body.   In   this   view,\n\nArticle 122(1)\ndisplaces the English doctrine\nof   exclusive   cognizance   of   internal\nproceedings of the House rendering irrelevant\nthe   case   law   that   emanated   from   courts   in\nthat   jurisdiction.   Any   attempt   to   read   a\nlimitation into\nArticle 122\nso as to restrict\nthe   court's   jurisdiction   to   examination   of\nthe   Parliament's   procedure   in   case   of\nunconstitutionality, as opposed to illegality\nwould   amount   to   doing   violence   to   the\nconstitutional   text.   Applying   the   principle\nof   \"expressio   unius   est   exclusio   alterius\"\n\n(whatever   has   not   been   included   has   by\nimplication   been   excluded),   it   is   plain   and\nclear that prohibition against examination on\nthe touchstone of \"irregularity of procedure\"\n\ndoes   not   make   taboo   judicial   review   on\nfindings   of   illegality   or\nunconstitutionality.”\n\n353.   The   above   case   is   a   clear   authority   for   the\n\nproposition   that\nArticle   122\ndoes   not   provide   for\n\nimmunity in case of illegality.   What is protected is\n\nonly   challenge   on   the   ground   of   any   irregularity   or\n\nprocedure.   The immunity from calling in question the\n\nParliamentary   decision   on   the   ground   of   violation   of\n\nprocedure as has been provided in the Constitution is\n\nin   recognition   of   the   principles   that   Parliament   has\n\nprivilege regarding procedure and any challenge on the\n\nground   of   violation   of   any   procedure   is   not\n\npermissible.\n\n354.   Shri   K.K.   Venugopal   relied   on   Two   Judgments   of\n\nthis Court in support of his submission namely,  Mohd.\n\nSaeed Siddiqui Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another,\n(2014)   11   SCC   415  and  Yogendra   Kumar   Jaiswal   and\n\nOthers   Vs.   State   of   Bihar   and   Others,   (2016)   3   SCC\n\n183.    He   submits   that   in   both   the   decisions,   this\n\nCourt while dealing with the question of challenge to\n\nMoney   Bill   has   clearly   held   that   the   decision   of\n\nSpeaker certifying a Bill as Money Bill is final and\n\ncannot be questioned.\n\n355.   We   need   to   consider   the   above   decisions   in\n\ndetail.\nMohd.   Saeed   Siddiqui\n(supra)  was   a   judgment\n\ndelivered by a Three Judge Bench of this Court.   U.P.\n\nLokayukta Act and U.P. Lokayukta (Amendment) Act, 2012\n\nwas   subject   matter   of   challenge.     One   of   the\n\nsubmissions in that regard has been noted in Para 12,\n\nwhich is to the following effect:­\n\n“12.   It   was   further   submitted   by   Mr.\nVenugopal that the Amendment Act was not even\npassed by the State Legislature in accordance\nwith   the   provisions   of   the   Constitution   of\nIndia and is, thus, a mere scrap of paper in\nthe eye of the law. The Bill in question was\npresented  as   a  Money   Bill  when,  on   the  face\nof   it,   it   could   never   be   called   as   a   Money\nBill as defined in\nArticles 199(1)\nand\n199(2)\n\nof   the   Constitution   of   India.   Since   the\nprocedure   for   an   Ordinary   Bill   was   not\nfollowed   and   the   assent   of   the   Governor   was\nobtained   to   an   inchoate   and   incomplete   Bill\nwhich had not even gone through the mandatory\nrequirements under the Constitution of India,\nthe   entire   action   was   unconstitutional   and\nviolative of\nArticle 200\nof the Constitution\nof India.”\n\n356.   This Court after noticing\nArticles 199\nand\n,\n\nwhich are  pari materia  to\nArticles 109\nand\nstated\n\nthat   proceeding   in   support   of   legislature   cannot   be\n\ncalled into question on the ground that they have not\n\nbeen   carried   on   in   accordance   with   the   rules   of\n\nbusiness.   This   Court   considered   the   issues   from\n\nParagraphs   34   to   38,   which   is   to   the   following\n\neffect:­\n\n“34. The above provisions make it clear that\nthe   finality   of   the   decision   of   the   Speaker\nand the proceedings of the State Legislature\nbeing   important   privilege   of   the   State\nLegislature,   viz.,   freedom   of   speech,   debate\nand proceedings are not to be inquired by the\nCourts.   The   \"proceeding   of   the   legislature\"\n\nincludes   everything   said   or   done   in   either\nHouse in the transaction of the Parliamentary\nbusiness,   which   in   the   present   case   is\nenactment   of   the   Amendment   Act.   Further,\n\nArticle   212\nprecludes   the   courts   from\ninterfering   with   the   presentation   of   a   Bill\nfor  assent  to  the  Governor   on  the  ground   of\nnon­compliance with the procedure for passing\nBills,   or   from   otherwise   questioning   the\nBills  passed   by  the  House.   To  put  it   clear,\nproceedings  inside   the   legislature   cannot   be\ncalled into question on the ground that they\nhave   not   been   carried   on   in   accordance   with\nthe   Rules   of   Business.   This   is   also   evident\nfrom\nArticle   194\nwhich   speaks   about   the\npowers,   privileges   of   the   Houses of   the\nLegislature and of the members and committees\nthereof.\n\n35.   We   have   already   quoted\nArticle   199.\n\nIn\nterms of\nArticle 199(3)\n, the decision of the\nSpeaker of the Legislative Assembly that the\nBill   in   question   was   a   Money   Bill   is   final\nand\nthe said decision\ncannot be disputed nor\ncan the procedure of the State Legislature be\nquestioned   by   virtue   of\nArticle   212.\n\nWe   are\nconscious of the fact that in the decision of\nthis   Court   in\nRaja   Ram   Pal   v.   Lok   Sabha\n\n(2007) 3 SCC 184, it has been held that the\nproceedings   which   may   be   tainted   on   account\nof   substantive   or   gross   irregularity   or\nunconstitutionality   are   not   protected   from\njudicial scrutiny.\n\n36. Even if it is established that there was\nsome   infirmity   in   the   procedure   in   the\nenactment   of   the   Amendment   Act,   in   terms   of\nArticle   255   of   the   Constitution   the   matters\nof procedures do not render invalid an Act to\nwhich assent has been given by the President\nor the Governor, as the case may be.\n\n37.\nIn\nM.S.M.   Sharma   v.   Shree   Krishna   Sinha\n\nAIR   1960   SC   1186   and   Mangalore   Ganesh   Beedi\nWorks   v.   State   of   Mysore\n,   AIR   1963   SC   589,\nthe   Constitution   Benches   of   this   Court   held\nthat:\n\n(i) the validity of an Act cannot be\nchallenged   on   the   ground   that   it\noffends\nArticles   197\nto   199 and   the\nprocedure\nlaid down in\n\nArticle 202;\n\n(ii)   Article   212   prohibits   the\nvalidity   of   any   proceedings   in   a\nLegislature   of   a   State   from   being\ncalled in question on the ground of\nany   alleged   irregularity   of\nprocedure; and\n\n(iii)\nArticle 255\nlays down that the\nrequirements as to recommendation and\nprevious sanction are to be regarded\nas a matter of procedure only.\n\nIt   is  further  held  that  the  validity  of  the\nproceedings inside the legislature of a State\ncannot   be   called   in   question   on   the\nallegation   that   the   procedure\nlaid   down   by\n\nthe   law   has   not   been   strictly   followed   and\nthat   no   Court   can   go   into   those   questions\nwhich are within the special jurisdiction of\nthe   legislature   itself,   which   has   the   power\nto conduct its own business.\n\n38. Besides, the question whether a Bill is a\nMoney Bill or not can be raised only in the\nState   Legislative   Assembly   by   a   member\nthereof when the Bill is pending in the State\nLegislature and before it becomes an Act. It\nis brought to our notice that in the instant\ncase   no   such   question   was   ever   raised   by\nanyone. ”\n\n357.  This Court came to the conclusion that  question\n\npertaining   to   the   procedure   in   the   House   could   not\n\nhave   been   questioned   by   virtue   of\nArticle   212.\n\nAnother   judgment,   which   has   been   relied   by   learned\n\nAttorney General is judgment of this Court in\nYogendra\n\nKumar   Jaiswal\n(supra).    The   above   judgment   was\n\nrendered by Two Judge Bench.   This Court\nin\nthe above\n\ncase\nexamined   the   question   whether   introduction   of\nOrissa Special Courts Act, 2006\nas a Money Bill could\n\nbe   called   in   question   in   a   Court.     This   Court\n\nconsidered the issue in Paragraphs 38 to 43, which are\n\nto the following effect:­\n\n“38.   First,   we   shall   take   up   the   issue\npertaining to the introduction of the Bill as\na   Money   bill   in   the   State   Legislature.   Mr.\nVinoo   Bhagat,   learned   Counsel   appearing   for\nsome of the appellants, has laid emphasis on\nthe   said   aspect.\nArticle   199\nof   the\nConstitution,   defines   “Money   Bills”.   For   our\npresent   purpose,   Clause   (3)   of\nArticle   199\n\nbeing relevant is reproduced below:\n\n“199.(3).   If   any   question   arises\nwhether   a   Bill   introduced   in   the\nlegislature   of   a   State   which   has   a\nLegislative   Council   is   a   Money   Bill\nor   not,   the   decision   of   the   Speaker\nof   the   Legislative   Assembly   of   such\nState thereon shall be final.\n\nWe   have   extracted   the   same   as   we   will   be\nreferring   to   the   authorities   as   regards\ninterpretation of the said clause.\n\n39.   Placing   reliance   on\nArticle   199\n,   the\nlearned Counsel would submit that the present\nAct which was introduced as a money bill has\nremotely   any   connection   with   the   concept   of\nmoney bill. It is urged by him that the State\nhas   made   a   Sisyphean   endeavour   to   establish\nsome connection. The High Court to repel the\nchallenge   had\nplaced   reliance   upon\n\nArticle\nwhich stipulates that the validity of any\nproceedings   in   the   Legislature   of   a   State\nshall not be called in question on the ground\nof any alleged irregularity of procedure.\n\n40. The learned Counsel for the appellants\nhas   drawn   inspiration   from   a   passage   from\nPowers,   Privileges   and   Immunities   of   State\n\nLegislatures.  In re, Special Reference No. 1\n\nof 1964 AIR 1965 SC 745, wherein it has been\nheld   that\nArticle   212(1)\nlays   down   that   the\nvalidity   of any   proceedings   in   the\nlegislature of a State shall not be called in\nquestion   on   the   ground   of   any   alleged\nirregularity   of  procedure   and\nArticle   212(2)\n\nconfers immunity on the officers and members\nof the legislature in whom powers are vested\nby   or   under   the   Constitution   for   regulating\nprocedure or the conduct of business, or for\nmaintaining   order,   in   the   legislature   from\nbeing   subject   to   the   jurisdiction   of   any\ncourt   in   respect   of   the   exercise   by   him   of\nthose   powers.   The   Court   opined   that\nArticle\n212(1)\nseems   to   make   it   possible   for   a\ncitizen   to   call   in   question   in   the\nappropriate court of law the validity of any\nproceedings inside the Legislative Chamber if\nhis case is that the said proceedings suffer\nnot from mere irregularity of procedure, but\nfrom an illegality. If the impugned procedure\nis illegal and unconstitutional, it would be\nopen   to   be   scrutinised   in   a   court   of   law,\nthough   such   scrutiny   is   prohibited   if   the\ncomplaint   against   the   procedure   is   not   more\nthan that the procedure was irregular. Thus,\nthe   said   authority   has   made   a distinction\nbetween   illegality   of   procedure   and\nirregularity of procedure.\n\n41.   Our   attention   has   also   been   drawn   to\ncertain   paragraphs   from   the   Constitution\nBench  decision  in\nRaja  Ram   Pal  v.  Lok  Sabha\n\n(2007) 3 SCC 184.\nIn the said case, in paras\n360 and 366, it has been held thus: (SCC pp.\n\n347 & 350)\n“360.   The   question   of   extent   of\njudicial   review   of   parliamentary\nmatters   has   to   be   resolved   with\nreference to the provision contained\nin\nArticle 122(1)\nthat corresponds to\n\nArticle   212\nreferred   to   in\nM.S.M.\nSharma   v.   Shree   Krishna   Sinha\nAIR\n1960 SC 1186 [Pandit Sharma (2)]. On\na   plain   reading,\nArticle   122(1)\n\nprohibits   \"the   validity   of   any\nproceedings in Parliament” from being\n'called   in   question'   in   a   court\nmerely on the ground of \"irregularity\nof   procedure\".   In   other   words,   the\nprocedural   irregularities   cannot   be\nused by the court to undo or vitiate\nwhat happens within the four walls of\nthe   legislature.   But   then,\n\"procedural   irregularity\"   stands   in\nstark   contrast   to   \"substantive\nillegality'   which   cannot   be   found\nincluded in the former. We are of the\nconsidered   view   that   this   specific\nprovision with regard to check on the\nrole of the judicial organ vis­à­vis\nproceedings   in   Parliament   uses\nlanguage   which   is   neither   vague   nor\nambiguous   and,   therefore,   must   be\ntreated as the constitutional mandate\non the subject, rendering unnecessary\nsearch   for   an   answer   elsewhere   or\ninvocation   of   principles of\nharmonious construction.\n\n* * *\n\n366.   The   touchstone   upon   which\nparliamentary actions within the four\nwalls   of   the   legislature   were\nexamined was both the constitutional\nas   well   as   substantive   law.   The\nproceedings   which   may   be   tainted   on\naccount of substantive illegality or\nunconstitutionality,   as   opposed   to\nthose   suffering   from   mere\nirregularity   thus   cannot   be   held\nprotected   from   judicial   scrutiny   by\n\nArticle 122(1)\ninasmuch as the broad\nprinciple\nlaid   down   in\nBradlaugh\n(1884) LR 12 QBD 271 : 53 LJQB 290 :\n\n50   LT   620   (DC),   acknowledging\nexclusive   cognizance   of   the\nlegislature   in   England   has   no\napplication   to   the   system   of\ngovernance   provided   by   our\nConstitution   wherein   no   organ   is\nsovereign and each organ is amenable\nto   constitutional   checks   and\ncontrols, in which scheme of things,\nthis Court is entrusted with the duty\nto   be   watchdog   of   and   guarantor   of\nthe Constitution.”\n\n42.   In   this   regard,   we   may   profitably   refer\nto   the   authority   in   Mohd.   Saeed   Siddiqui   v.\n\nState   of   U.P.   (2014)   11   SCC   415,   wherein   a\nthree­Judge   Bench   while   dealing   with   such   a\nchallenge,   held   that\nArticle   212\nprecludes\nthe   courts   from   interfering   with   the\npresentation   of   a   Bill   for   assent   to   the\nGovernor on the ground of non­compliance with\nthe   procedure   for   passing   Bills,   or   from\notherwise questioning the Bills passed by the\nHouse, for proceedings inside the legislature\ncannot be called into question on the ground\nthat   they   have   not   been   carried   on   in\naccordance   with   the   Rules   of   Business.\n\nThereafter,   the   Court   referring   to\nArticle\n199(3)\nruled that the decision of the Speaker\nof the Legislative Assembly that the Bill in\nquestion   was   a   Money   Bill   is   final and\nthe\nsaid decision\ncannot be disputed nor can the\nprocedure   of   the   State   Legislature   be\nquestioned   by   virtue   of\nArticle   212.\n\nThe\nCourt  took  note  of  the   decision  in\nRaja  Ram\nPal\n(supra) wherein it has been held that the\nproceedings   which   may   be   tainted   on   account\nof   substantive   or   gross   irregularity   or\nunconstitutionality   are   not   protected   from\njudicial   scrutiny.   Eventually,   the   Court\nrepelled the challenge.\n\n43.\nIn   our   considered   opinion,   the\nauthorities cited by the learned Counsel for\nthe appellants do not render much assistance,\nfor  the  introduction  of  a  Bill,  as   has  been\nheld   in\nMohd.   Saeed   Siddiqui\n(supra),   comes\nwithin   the   concept   of   \"irregularity\"   and   it\ndoes   come   with   the   realm   of substantiality.\n\nWhat   has   been   held   in   the   Special   Reference\nNo.   1   of   1964   (supra)   has   to   be   appositely\nunderstood.\nThe   factual   matrix   therein   was\ntotally different than the case at hand as we\nfind   that   the   present   controversy   is   wholly\ncovered   by   the   pronouncement   in\nMohd.   Saeed\nSiddiqui\n(supra) and hence, we unhesitatingly\nhold that there is no merit in the submission\nso   assiduously   urged   by   the   learned   Counsel\nfor the appellants.”\n\n358.   The   consideration\nin\nthe   above   case\n\nindicate that this Court has merely relied on judgment\n\nof Three Judge Bench in\nMohd. Saeed Siddiqui\n(supra).\n\nThe   Court   based   its   decision   on   finality   attached   to\n\nthe decision of the Speaker in\nArticle 199(3)\nas well\n\nas   bar   on   challenge   of   proceeding   of   the   legislature\n\non   an   irregularity   procedure   as   contained   in   Article\n\n212.   The question is, where a Speaker certify a Bill\n\nas a Money Bill and it is introduced and passed as a\n\nMoney Bill, this only a question of procedure or not?\n\nArticle 107\ncontains provisions as to introduction of\npassing   of   bills.\nArticle   107(2)\nstate   that   subject\n\nto   the   provisions   of\nArticles   108\nand\n,   a   Bill\n\nshall not be deemed to have been passed by the Houses\n\nof   Parliament   unless   it   has   been   agreed   to   by   both\n\nHouses   of   Parliament.   However,   the   requirement   of\n\npassing a Bill by both the Houses is not applicable in\n\ncase of Money Bills.\nArticle 110\ndefines as to what is\n\nthe   Money   Bill.   A   Money   Bill   is   constitutionally\n\ndefined and a Bill shall be a Money Bill only if it is\n\ncovered   by\nArticle   110(1).\nA   Bill,   which   does   not\n\nfulfill the conditions as enumerated in\nArticle 110(1)\n\nand   it   is   certified   as   Money   Bill,   whether   the\n\nConstitutional conditions enumerated in\nArticle 110(1)\n\nshall be overridden only by certificate of Speaker?\n\n359. We have noticed the Constitution Bench Judgment in\n\nKihoto Hollohan\n(supra) and\nRaja Ram Pal\n(supra)  that\n\nfinality of the decision of the Speaker is not immuned\n\nfrom   Judicial   Review.     All   Bills   are   required   to   be\n\npassed   by   both   Houses   of   Parliament.     Exception is\n\ngiven in case of Money Bills and in the case of joint\n\nsitting   of   both   houses.     In   event,   we   accept   the\nsubmission   of   learned   Attorney   General   that\n\ncertification by Speaker is only a matter of procedure\n\nand cannot be questioned by virtue of\nArticle 122(1)\n,\n\nany   Bill,   which   does   not   fulfill   the   essential\n\nconstitutional   condition   under\nArticle   110\ncan   be\n\ncertified   as   Money   Bill   bye­passing   the   Upper   House.\n\nThere   is   a   clear   difference   between   the   subject\n\n“irregularity   of   procedure”   and   “substantive\n\nillegality”.     When   a   Bill   does   not   fulfill   the\n\nessential   constitutional   condition   under\nArticle\n\n110(1)\n,   the   said   requirement   cannot   be   said   to   be\n\nevaporated   only   on   certification   by   Speaker.\n\nAccepting   the   submission   that   certification   immunes\n\nthe   challenge   on   the   ground   of   not   fulfilling   the\n\nconstitutional   condition,   Court   will   be   permitting\n\nconstitutional   provisions   to   be   ignored   and   bye­\n\npassed.    We,   thus,   are   of   the   view   that   decision   of\n\nSpeaker certifying the Bill as Money Bill is not only\n\na matter of procedure and in event, any illegality has\n\noccurred   in   the   decision   and   the   decision   is   clearly\n\nin   breach   of   the   constitutional   provisions,   the\ndecision   is   subject   to   Judicial   Review.\n\nWe   are,\n\ntherefore,   of   the   view   that   the   Three   Judge   Bench\n\nJudgment   of   this   Court   in\nMohd.   Saeed   Siddiqui\n\n(supra)  and Two Judge Bench judgment of this Court in\n\nYogendra   Kumar   Jaiswal\n(supra)  does   not   lay   down   the\n\ncorrect law.   We, thus, conclude that the decision of\n\nthe Speaker certifying the Aadhaar Bill as Money Bill\n\nis not immuned from Judicial Review.\n\n360.     We   having   held   that   the   decision   of   Speaker\n\ncertifying the Aadhaar Bill as a Money Bill is open to\n\nJudicial   Review.     We   now   proceed   to   examine   as   to\n\nwhether Speaker's decision certifying the Aadhaar Bill\n\nas   Money   Bill   contravenes   any   of   the   Constitutional\n\nprovisions, i.e., Whether the decision is vitiated by\n\nany   Constitutional   Illegality?     For   determining   the\n\nmain issue, which need to be answered is as to whether\n\nAadhaar Bill is covered by any of Clauses (a) to (f)\n\nof\nArticle 110(1).\nThat Clause(g) shall be applicable\n\nonly   when   any   of   Clauses   (a)   to   (f)   are   attracted.\n\nClause   (g)   which   contemplate   that   any   matter\n\nincidental   to   any   of   the   matters   specified   in   sub­\nclauses   (a)   to   (f),   can   be   a   provision   in   a   Bill\n\npresupposes   that   main   provisions   have   to   fall   in   any\n\nof the Clauses (a) to (f).   The heart of the Aadhaar\n\nAct is\nSection 7\n, which is to the following effect:­\n\n“7. Proof   of   Aadhaar   number   necessary   for\nreceipt   of   certain   subsidies,   benefits   and\nservices, etc.­ The Central Government or, as\nthe   case   may   be,   the   State   Government   may,\nfor   the   purpose   of   establishing   identity   of\nan individual as a condition for receipt of a\nsubsidy,   benefit   or   service   for   which   the\nexpenditure is incurred from, or the receipt\ntherefrom   forms   part   of,   the   Consolidated\nFund   of   India,   require   that   such   individual\nundergo   authentication,   or   furnish   proof   of\npossession   of   Aadhaar   number   or   in   the   case\nof   an   individual   to   whom   no   Aadhaar   number\nhas   been   assigned,   such   individual   makes   an\napplication for enrolment:\n\nProvided that if an Aadhaar number is not\nassigned   to   an   individual,   the   individual\nshall   be   offered   alternate   and   viable   means\nof   identification   for   delivery   of   the\nsubsidy, benefit or service.”\n\n361.  A condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or\n\nservice for which the expenditure is incurred from, or\n\nthe receipt therefrom forms part of, the Consolidated\n\nFund   of   India,   has   been   provided   by\nSection   7\n,   i.e.\n\nundergoing of an individual to an authentication.  The\n\nPreamble of the Act as well as objects and reasons as\nnoticed   above   also   indicate   that   the   Act   has   been\n\nenacted   to   provide   for,   as   a   good   governance,\n\nefficient,   transparent,   and   targeted   delivery   of\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services, the expenditure for\n\nwhich is incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India,\n\nto individuals residing in India through assigning of\n\nunique   identity   numbers   to   such   individuals   and   for\n\nmatters   connected   therewith   or   incidental   thereto.\n\nThus, the theme of the Act or main purpose and object\n\nof the Act is to bring in place efficient, transparent\n\nand   targeted   deliveries   of   subsidies,   benefits   and\n\nservices,   which   expenditure   is   out   from   the\n\nConsolidated   Fund   of   India.     Thus,   the   above\n\nprovisions   of   the   Act   is   clearly   covered   by\nArticle\n\n110(1)(c)\nand (e).\n\n362.   Shri   P.   Chidambaram,   learned   counsel   for\n\npetitioners has laid much emphasis on the word “only“\n\nas occurring in\nArticle 110(1).\nThe word “only” used\n\nin\nArticle   110(1)\nhas   purpose   and   meaning.     The\n\nlegislative   intendment   was   that   main   and   substantive\n\nprovisions   should   be   only   any   or   all   of   the   clauses\nfrom (a) to (f).   In event, the main and substantive\n\nprovision of the Act are not covered by Clauses (a) to\n\n(f), the said Bill cannot be said to be a Money Bill.\n\nIt   will   not   be   out   of   place   to   mention   here   that   in\n\nConstituent   Assembly,   an   amendment   was   moved   for\n\ndeletion   of   word   “only”   on   20.05.1949,   Hon'ble   Shri\n\nGhanshyam   Singh   Gupta   moved   the   amendment   in   Draft\n\nArticle 90.\nIt is useful to extract the above debate,\n\nwhich is to the following effect:­\n\nThe   Honourable   Shri   Ghanshyam   Singh   Gupta\n(C.P. & Berar: General): Sir, I beg to move:\n\n\"That  in   clause  (1)  of\narticle  90\n,   the  word\n`only' be deleted.\"\n\nThis article is a prototype of\nSection 37\nof\nthe Government of India Act which says that a\nBill   or   amendment   providing   for   imposing   or\nincreasing   a   tax   or   borrowing   money,   etc.\nshall   not   be   introduced   or   moved   except   on\nthe   recommendation   of   the   Governor­General.\nThis means that the whole Bill need not be a\nmoney Bill: it may contain other provisions,\nbut if there is any provision about taxation\nor   borrowing,   etc.   It   will   come   under   this\n\nSection37\n,   and   the   recommendation   of   the\nGovernor­General is necessary. Now\narticle 90\n\nsays   that   a   Bill   shall   be   deemed   to   be   a\nmoney   Bill   if   it   contains   only   provisions\ndealing   with   the   imposition,   regulation,\netc.,  of   any  tax   or  the  borrowing  of   money,\netc.   This   can   mean   that   if   there   is   a   Bill\nwhich   has   other   provisions   and   also   a\nprovision   about   taxation   or   borrowing   etc.,\nit will not become a money Bill. If that is\nthe intention I have nothing to say; but that\nif that is not the intention I must say the\nword \"only\" is dangerous, because if the Bill\ndoes   all   these   things   and   at   the   same   time\ndoes   something   else   also   it   will   not   be   a\nmoney Bill. I do not know what the intention\nof the Drafting Committee is but I think this\naspect   of   the   article   should   be   borne   in\nmind.”\n\n363.   After   discussion,   Mr.   Naziruddin   Ahmad   also\n\nsuggested   that   the   position   of   the   word   “only”   in\n\nconnection with Amendment No.1669 should be specially\n\nconsidered.     It   is   a   word   which   is   absolutely\n\nmisplaced.     On   that   day,   the   consideration   was\n\ndeferred   and   again   in   the   debate   on   06.06.1949,\n\nConstituent   Assembly   took   up   the   discussion.     The\n\nPresident   of   the   Constituent   Assembly   placed   the\n\namendment for vote on 08.06.1949, which amendment was\n\nnegativated.     Thus,   use   of   word   “only”   in\nArticle\n\n110(1)\nhas   its   purpose,   which   is   a   clear   restriction\n\nfor a Bill to be certified as a Money Bill.\n\n364.   Other   provisions   of   the   Act   can   be   said   to   be\n\nincidental   to   the   above   matter.     The   architecture   of\nthe   Aadhaar   Act   veer   round   the   Government's\n\nconstitutional   obligation   to   provide   for   subsidies,\n\nbenefits   and   services   to   the   individuals,   who   are\n\nentitled   for   such   subsidies,   benefits   and   services.\n\nSection   24\ncontemplates   the   appropriation   made   by\n\nParliament by law for grant of sums of money for the\n\npurposes   of   Aadhaar   Act.     The   disbursement   of\n\nsubsidies, benefits and services from the Consolidated\n\nFund of India is in substance, the main object of the\n\nAct for which Aadhaar architecture has been envisaged\n\nand   other provisions   are   only   to   give   effect   to   the\n\nabove main theme of the Act.   Other provisions of the\n\nAct are only incidental provisions to main provision.\n\nSection 57\non which much attack has been made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners that it cannot be\n\ncovered   by   any   of   the   provisions   from   (a)   to   (f)   of\n\nArticle 110(!).\nSuffice it to say that\nSection 57\nis\n\na provision which clarifies that nothing contained in\n\nAadhaar   Act   shall   prevent   the   use   of   Aadhaar   number\n\nfor establishing the identity of an individual for any\n\npurpose, whether by the State or any body corporate or\nperson,   pursuant   to   any   law,   for   the   time   being   in\n\nforce,   or   any   contract   to   this   effect.     The\n\napplicability   of   the   provision   of\nSection   57\ncomes\n\ninto   play   when   Aadhaar   Number   is   allocated   to   an\n\nindividual after completing the process under the Act.\n\nSection   57\nis   also   a   incidental   provision   covered   by\n\nsub­clause(g)     of\nArticle   110(1).\n\nSection   57\nis   a\n\nlimitation imposed under the Act on the use of Aadhaar\n\nNumber  by State or any  body corporate or  any private\n\nparty.     We,   thus,   are   of   the   view   that   Aadhaar   Bill\n\nhas   rightly   been   certified   as   the   Money   Bill   by   the\n\nSpeaker,   which   decision   does   not   violate   any\n\nconstitutional provision, hence does not call for any\n\ninterference   in   this   proceeding.     Issue   No.   16   is\n\nanswered in the following manner:­\n\nAns.16:­  Aadhaar Act has been rightly passed as Money\n\nBill.  The decision of Speaker certifying the\n\nAadhaar   Bill,   2016   as   Money   Bill   is   not\n\nimmuned from Judicial Review.\nIssue No.17 Whether\nSection   139\n­AA   of   the   Income   Tax\nAct,   1961   is   unconstitutional   in   view   of\nthe Privacy judgment in\nPuttaswamy\ncase?\n\n365.\nSection 139\n­AA was challenged by a bunch of writ\n\npetitions,   which   were   decided   by   this   Court   in\nBinoy\n\nViswam Vs. Union of India and Others\n, (2017) 7 SCC 59.\n\nThe   writ   petitions   were   disposed   of   upholding   the\n\nvires   of\nSection   139\n­AA.     Para   136   of   the   judgment\n\ncontains operative portion, which is to the following\n\neffect:­\n\n“136.  Subject   to   the   aforesaid,   these   writ\npetitions   are   disposed   of   in   the   following\nmanner:\n\n136.1  We   hold   that   the   Parliament   was   fully\ncompetent to enact\nSection 139\n­AA of the Act\nand   its   authority   to   make   this   law   was   not\ndiluted by the orders of this Court.\n\n136.2.    We  do  not  find   any  conflict  between\nthe provisions of the Aadhaar Act and\nSection\n139AA\nof the Income Tax Act inasmuch as when\ninterpreted   harmoniously,   they   operate   in\ndistinct fields.\n\n136.3.\nSection   139\n­AA   of   the   Act   is   not\ndiscriminatory nor it offends equality Clause\nenshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\n\n136.4.\nSection   139\n­AA   is   also   not   violative\nof\nArticle   19(1)(g)\nof   the   Constitution\ninsofar   as   it   mandates   giving   of   Aadhaar\nenrollment number for applying for PAN cards,\nin the income tax returns or notified Aadhaar\nenrollment   number   to   the   designated\nauthorities.   Further,   the   proviso   to   Sub­\nsection   (2)   thereof   has   to   be   read   down   to\nmean   that   it   would   operate   only\nprospectively.\n\n136.5    The   validity   of   the   provision   upheld\nin the aforesaid manner is subject to passing\nthe muster of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution,\nwhich   is   the   issue   before   the   Constitution\nBench   in   Writ   Petition   (Civil)   No.   494   of\n2012 and other connected matters. Till then,\nthere   shall   remain   a   partial   stay   on   the\noperation   of   the   proviso   to   Sub­section   (2)\nof\nSection   139\n­AA   of   the   Act,   as   described\nabove.  No cost.”\n\n366.   As   per   the   above   judgment,   the   validity   of   the\n\nprovisions   of   Section­139AA   was   upheld   subject   to\n\npassing the muster of\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution,\n\nwhich   was   the   issue   pending   before   the   Constitution\n\nBench in Writ Petition (C) No. 494 of 2012 and other\n\nconnected matters.  The Constitution Bench Judgment in\n\nPuttaswamy  was   delivered   on   24.08.2017.   Right   of\n\nPrivacy   has   been   held   to   be   fundamental   right,   any\n\nrestriction on such fundamental right has been held to\n\nbe valid when it passes the muster of three­fold test\n\nas   laid   down   there.     In   the   lead   judgment   of   Dr.\nJustice D.Y. Chandrachud, three­fold test are:­\n\n(a)  The existence of law;\n\n(b)  A legitimate State interest and\n\n(c) such   law   should   pass   the   test   of\n\nproportionality.\n\n367.   Dr.   Justice   Chandrachud   has   delivered   the\n\njudgment   for   himself   and   three   other   Hon'ble   Judges,\n\nJustice Sanjay Kishan Kaul in paragraph 639 has upheld\n\nthe   test   of   proportionality.     As   a   result,   at­least\n\nfive   out   of   nine   Judges   requires   the   proportionality\n\ntest to be  applied.\nIn addition to tests propounded\n\nby   a   Constitution   Bench   in\nPuttaswamy\ncase,   an\n\nadditional   test   as   propounded   by   a   Five   Judges\n\nConstitution   Bench   of   this   Court   in\nShayara   Bano   Vs.\n\nUnion of  India\n, (2017) 9 SCC  1,  Justice R.F. Nariman\n\nhas   laid   down   a   test   of   “manifest   arbitrariness”.\n\nReading   the   Nine   Judge   Bench   decision   in\nPuttaswamy\n\ncase   and   Five   Judge   Bench   decision   in  Shayara   Bano's\n\ncase,   the   Petitioner   can   succeed   to   the   challenge   to\n\nSection   139\n­AA   only   if   they   successfully   demonstrate\n\nthe said provision to be violative of Right to Privacy\non the basis of the following tests:­\n\n(i) Absence of law;\n\n(ii) Absence of Legitimate State Interest;\n\n(iii) The   provision   being   hit   by   lack   of\nproportionality.\n(iv) The   provision   being   manifestly   arbitrary,\nwhich   can   be   traced   to\nArticle   14.\n[The\n\ntest   to   determine   “manifest   arbitrariness”\nis   to   decide   whether   the   enactment   is\ndrastically   unreasonable   and   /   or\ncapricious,   irrational   or   without   adequate\ndetermining principle”]\n\n368.  The learned Attorney General relies on following\n\ninterest,   which   according   to   him   are   safeguarded   by\n\nSection   139\n­AA   to   satisfy   the   legitimate   State\n\ninterest:­\n\na. To   prevent   income   tax   evasion   by\nrequiring,   through   an   amendment   to   the\n\nIncome   Tax   Act\n,   that   the   Aadhaar   number\nbe linked with the PAN; and\nb. Prevention, accumulation, circulation and\nuse   of   black   money   and   money   laundering\nby   imposing   a   requirement by   law   for\nlinking   Aadhaar   for   opening   bank\naccounts;\n\nc. To prevent terrorism and protect national\nsecurity   and   prevention   of   crime   by\nrequiring   that   Aadhaar   number   be   linked\nto SIM cards for mobile phones.\n\n369.   Binoy Viswam  has examined\nSection 139\n­AA on the\n\nPrinciple of Doctrine of Proportionality in Paragraphs\n\n123 to 125:­\n\n“123.  Keeping   in   view   the   aforesaid\nparameters and principles in mind, we proceed\nto   discuss   as   to   whether   the   “restrictions”\nwhich would result in terms of the proviso to\nsub­section (2) of\nSection 139\n­AA of the Act\nare reasonable or not.\n\n124.  Let   us   revisit   the   objectives   of\nAadhaar, and in the process, that of\nSection\n­AA of the Act in particular.\n\n125.  By   making   use   of   the   technology,   a\nmethod   is  sought  to  be   devised,  in   the  form\nof   Aadhaar,   whereby   identity   of   a   person   is\nascertained   in   a   flawless   manner   without\ngiving any leeway to any individual to resort\nto   dubious   practices   of   showing   multiple\nidentities   or   fictitious   identities.   That   is\nwhy   it   is   given   the   nomenclature   “unique\nidentity”. It is aimed at securing advantages\non   different   levels   some   of   which   are\ndescribed, in brief, below:\n\n125.1.  In   the   first   instance,   as   a   welfare\nand democratic State, it becomes the duty of\nany   responsible   Government   to   come   out   with\nwelfare   schemes   for   the   upliftment   of\npoverty­stricken and marginalised sections of\nthe society. This is even the ethos of Indian\nConstitution which casts a duty on the State,\nin the form of “directive principles of State\npolicy”, to take adequate and effective steps\nfor   betterment   of   such   underprivileged\nclasses.   State   is   bound   to   take   adequate\nmeasures   to   provide   education,   health   care,\nemployment   and   even   cultural   opportunities\nand   social   standing   to   these   deprived   and\nunderprivileged   classes.   It   is   not   that\nGovernment   has   not   taken   steps   in   this\ndirection   from   time   to   time.   At   the   same\ntime, however, harsh reality is that benefits\nof   these   schemes   have   not   reached   those\npersons for whom that are actually meant.\n\n125.1.1.  India   has   achieved   significant\neconomic   growth   since   Independence.   In\nparticular,   rapid   economic   growth   has   been\nachieved   in   the   last   25   years,   after   the\ncountry  adopted  the  policy   of   liberalisation\nand   entered   the   era   of,   what   is   known   as,\nglobalisation.   Economic   growth   in   the   last\ndecade   has   been   phenomenal   and   for   many\nyears,   the   Indian   economy   grew   at   highest\nrate   in   the   world.   At   the   same   time,   it   is\nalso   a   fact   that   in   spite   of   significant\npolitical   and   economic   success   which   has\nproved   to   be   sound   and   sustainable,   the\nbenefits thereof have not percolated down to\nthe   poor   and   the   poorest.   In   fact,   such\nbenefits   are   reaped   primarily   by   rich   and\nupper middle classes, resulting into widening\nthe gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n125.1.2.  Jean   Dreze   and   Amartya   Sen   pithily\nnarrate the position as under:\n\n“Since   India’s   recent   record   of   fast\neconomic   growth   is   often   celebrated,\nwith   good   reason,   it   is   extremely\nimportant to point to the fact that the\nsocietal   reach   of   economic   progress   in\nIndia   has   been   remarkably   limited.   It\nis   not   only   that   the   income\ndistribution   has   been   getting   more\nunequal   in   recent   years   (a\ncharacteristic   that   India   shares   with\nChina), but also that the rapid rise in\nreal   wages   in   China   from   which   the\nworking   classes   have   benefited   greatly\nis   not   matched   at   all   by   India’s\nrelatively stagnant real wages. No less\nimportantly,   the   public   revenue\ngenerated   by   rapid   economic   growth\nhas not been used to expand the social\nand   physical   infrastructure   in   a\ndetermined   and   well­planned   way   (in\nthis   India   is   left   far   behind   by\nChina).  There is  also a  continued lack\nof   essential   social   services   (from\nschooling   and   health   care   to   the\nprovision   of   safe   water   and   drainage)\nfor   a   huge   part   of   the   population.   As\nwe   will   presently   discuss,   while   India\nhas   been   overtaking   other   countries   in\nthe progress of its real income, it has\nbeen   overtaken   in   terms   of   social\nindicators   by   many   of   these   countries,\neven   within   the   region   of   South   Asia\nitself   (we   go   into   this   question   more\nfully   in   Chapter   3,   ‘India   in\nComparative Perspective’).\n\nTo   point   to   just   one   contrast,   even\nthough   India   has   significantly   caught\nup   with   China   in   terms   of   GDP   growth,\nits  progress  has  been very  much  slower\nthan   China’s   in   indicators   such   as\nlongevity,   literacy,   child\nundernourishment   and   maternal\nmortality.   In   South   Asia   itself,   the\nmuch   poorer   economy   of   Bangladesh   has\ncaught   up   with   and   overtaken   India   in\nterms   of   many   social   indicators\n(including   life   expectancy,\nimmunisation   of   children,   infant\nmortality,   child   undernourishment   and\ngirls’   schooling).   Even   Nepal   has   been\ncatching up, to the extent that it now\nhas   many   social   indicators   similar   to\nIndia’s, in spite of its per capita GDP\nbeing   just   about   one   third.   Whereas\ntwenty   years   ago   India   generally   had\nthe second best social indicators among\nthe   six   South   Asian   countries   (India,\nPakistan,   Bangladesh,   Sri   Lanka,   Nepal\nand  Bhutan),  it  now  looks second  worst\n(ahead   only   of   problem­ridden\nPakistan).   India   has   been   climbing   up\nthe   ladder   of   per   capita   income   while\nslipping   down   the   slope   of   social\nindicators.”\n\n125.1.3.  It is in this context that not only\nsustainable development is needed which takes\ncare   of   integrating   growth   and   development,\nthereby ensuring that the benefit of economic\ngrowth   is   reaped   by   every   citizen   of   this\ncountry,   it   also   becomes   the   duty   of   the\nGovernment   in a   welfare   State   to   come   out\nwith   various   welfare   schemes   which   not   only\ntake care of immediate needs of the deprived\nclass   but   also   ensure   that   adequate\nopportunities are provided to such persons to\nenable   them   to   make   their   lives   better,\neconomically   as   well   as   socially.   As\nmentioned above, various welfare schemes are,\nin   fact,   devised   and   floated   from   time   to\ntime   by   the   Government,   keeping   aside\nsubstantial   amount   of   money   earmarked   for\nspending   on   socially   and   economically\nbackward   classes.   However,   for   various\nreasons   including   corruption,   actual   benefit\ndoes   not   reach   those   who   are   supposed   to\nreceive   such   benefits.   One   of   the   main\nreasons is failure to identify these persons\nfor lack of means by which identity could be\nestablished   of   such   genuine   needy   class.\n\nResultantly,   lots   of   ghosts   and   duplicate\nbeneficiaries   are   able   to   take   undue   and\nimpermissible   benefits.   A   former   Prime\nMinister   of   this   country   has   gone   on   record\nto   say   that   out   of   one   rupee   spent   by   the\nGovernment   for   welfare   of   the   downtrodden,\nonly 15 paisa thereof actually reaches those\npersons   for   whom   it   is   meant.   It   cannot   be\ndoubted   that   with   UID/Aadhaar   much   of   the\nmalaise in this field can be taken care of.\n\n125.2.  Menace   of   corruption and   black   money\nhas   reached   alarming   proportion   in   this\ncountry.   It   is   eating   into   the   economic\nprogress   which   the   country   is   otherwise\nachieving. It is not necessary to go into the\nvarious reasons for this menace. However, it\nwould   be   pertinent   to   comment   that   even   as\nper   the   observations   of   the   Special\nInvestigation   Team   (SIT)   on   black   money\nheaded   by   Justice   M.B.   Shah,   one   of   the\nreasons   is   that   persons   have   the   option   to\nquote their PAN or UID or passport number or\ndriving   licence   or   any   other   proof   of\nidentity   while   entering   into\nfinancial/business   transactions.   Because   of\nthis   multiple   methods   of   giving   proofs   of\nidentity,   there   is   no   mechanism/system   at\npresent   to   collect   the   data   available   with\neach   of   the   independent   proofs   of   ID.   For\nthis   reason,   even   SIT   suggested   that   these\ndatabases   be   interconnected.   To   the   same\neffect is the recommendation of the Committee\nheaded   by   Chairman,   CBDT   on   measures   to\ntackle black money in India and abroad which\nalso   discusses   the   problem   of   money\nlaundering   being   done   to   evade   taxes   under\nthe   garb   of   shell   companies   by   the   persons\nwho   hold   multiple   bogus   PAN   numbers   under\ndifferent names or variations of their names.\nThat can be possible if one uniform proof of\nidentity, namely, UID is adopted. It may go a\nlong   way   to   check   and   minimise   the   said\nmalaise.\n\n125.3.  Thirdly,   Aadhaar   or   UID,   which   has\ncome   to   be   known   as   the   most   advanced   and\nsophisticated   infrastructure,   may   facilitate\nlaw­enforcement   agencies   to   take   care   of\nproblem   of   terrorism   to   some   extent   and   may\nalso   be   helpful   in   checking   the   crime   and\nalso   help   investigating  agencies   in  cracking\nthe crimes. No doubt, going by the aforesaid,\nand   may   be   some   other   similarly   valid\nconsiderations,   it   is   the   intention   of   the\nGovernment to give fillip to Aadhaar movement\nand   encourage   the   people   of   this   country   to\nenrol themselves under the Aadhaar Scheme.”\n\n370.  In Paragraphs 122 to 125 of Binoy Viswam, it has\n\nalso   been observed   that   the   measures   taken   may   go   a\n\nlong   way   to   check   and minimise   the   malaise   of   black\n\nmoney.\n\n371.   Dr. Justice  D.Y. Chandrachud in\nPuttaswamy\ncase\n\nin Paragraph 311 has stated:­\n\n“311.  …......Prevention and investigation of\ncrime and protection of the revenue are among\nthe   legitimate   aims   of   the   State.     Digital\nplatforms   are   a   vital   tool   of   ensuring   good\ngovernance   in   a   social   welfare   State.\n\nInformation   technology   –   legitimately\ndeployed is a powerful enabler in the spread\nof innovation and knowledge.”\n372.\nIn\nPuttaswamy\ncase,   Justice   Sanjay   Kishan   Kaul\n\nhas   noted   the   European   Union   General   Data   Protection\n\nRegulation and observed that restrictions on the right\n\nto   privacy   may   be   justifiable   on   the   ground   of\n\nregulation   of   taxes   and   financial   institutions.       In\n\nParagraph 640, Justice Kaul has held:­\n\n“640.  It   would   be   useful   to   turn   to   the\nEuropean   Union   Regulation   of   2016.\n\nRestrictions   of   the   right   to   privacy   may   be\njustifiable   in   the   following   circumstances\nsubject to the principle of proportionality:\n\n(a)  Other   fundamental   rights:   The\nright to  privacy  must be  considered  in\nrelation to its function in society and\nbe   balanced   against   other   fundamental\nrights.\n\n(b)   Legitimate   national   security\ninterest.\n\n(c)   Public   interest   including\nscientific   or   historical   research\npurposes or statistical purposes.\n\n(d)  Criminal   offences:   The   need   of\nthe   competent   authorities   for\nprevention   investigation,   prosecution\nof   criminal   offences   including\nsafeguards   against   threat   to   public\nsecurity;\n\n(e)  The   unidentifiable   data:   The\ninformation   does   not   relate   to\nidentified   or   identifiable   natural\nperson   but   remains   anonymous.   The\nEuropean   Union   Regulation   of   2016\nrefers   to   “pseudonymisation”   which\nmeans   the   processing   of   personal   data\nin such a manner that the personal data\ncan   no   longer   be   attributed   to   a\nspecific   data   subject   without   the   use\nof   additional   information,   provided\nthat   such   additional   information   is\nkept   separately   and   is   subject   to\ntechnical   and   organisational   measures\nto   ensure   that   the   personal   data   are\nnot   attributed   to   an   identified   or\nidentifiable natural person;\n\n(f)  The   tax,   etc.:   The   regulatory\nframework   of   tax   and   working   of\nfinancial   institutions,   markets   may\nrequire   disclosure   of   private\ninformation.   But   then   this   would   not\nentitle   the   disclosure   of   the\ninformation to all and sundry and there\nshould   be   data   protection   rules\naccording   to   the   objectives   of   the\nprocessing.   There   may   however,   be\nprocessing   which   is   compatible   for   the\npurposes   for   which   it   is   initially\ncollected.”\n\n373.\nSection   139\n­AA   thus   clearly   enacted   to   fulfill\n\nthe   legitimate   State   interest.\nSection   139\n­A   which\n\ncame   into   effect   w.e.f.   01.04.1989   provide   for\n\nPermanent Account Number (PAN) and the provision also\n\nprovided   that   statutory   mandatory   provisions   as   to\nwhen   “every   person”   shall   quote   such   number   (PAN\n\nnumber) for various purposes as enumerated in\nSection\n\n139A\n.   Introduction of\nSection 139\n­AA is an extension\n\nand implication of\nSection 139A\n.   The introduction of\n\nSection   139\n­AA   was   for   the   purpose   of   eliminating\n\nduplicate   PANs   from   the   system   with   the   help   of   a\n\nrobust technology solution.\n\n374.   The   new\nSection   139\n­AA   in   the   Income   Tax   Act\n\nseeks   to   remove   bogus   PAN   cards   by   linking   with\n\nAadhaar,   expose   shell   companies   and   thereby   curb   the\n\nmenace   of   black   money,   money   laundering   and   tax\n\nevasion.   The fact that the tax base of India is very\n\nnarrow   and   that   we   are   a   largely   tax   non­compliant\n\nsociety is evident from some of the startling figures\n\nin the budget speech of the Finance Minister. Linking\n\nof   PAN   with   Aadhaar   will   at   least   ensure   that\n\nduplicate   and   fake   PAN   cards   which   are   used   for   the\n\npurpose of tax  evasion will be eliminated and is one\n\nof   the   many   fiscal   measures   to   eliminate   black   money\n\nfrom the system.\n375.   The  Binoy Viswam  has referred to other relevant\n\nrationals   for   enactment   of\nSection   139\n­AA.\nSection\n­AA   also   cannot   be   said   to   be   disproportionate.\n\nThe section has been enacted to achieve the legitimate\n\nState   aim.\nSection   139\n­AA   is   a   law   framed   by\n\nParliament, which require linking of the Aadhaar with\n\nPAN.     The   means   which   are   sought   to be   achieved   by\n\nsuch   enactment   cannot   be   said   to   be   disproportionate\n\nin   any   manner.   It   has   been   further   submitted   that\n\nSection   139\n­AA   unfairly   attracts   only   individual\n\nassessees and not other tax paying assessees, who may\n\nalso   be   involved   in   financial   frauds.     The   above\n\nsubmission need not detain us since Aadhaar number can\n\nbe obtained by the individuals and not by the entities\n\nhence   Section­139AA   can   only   apply   to   individuals.\n\nIn   any   event,   the   legislature   cannot   be   expected   to\n\naddress   all   issues   relating   to   a   particular   evil   at\n\none   go.\nSection   139\n­AA   is   a   required   first   step   to\n\nweed   out   fake   PANs   for   individuals;   it   is   perfectly\n\nacceptable   for   the   legislature   to   weed   out   fake   PANs\n\nfor other tax­paying entities at a later stage.   Such\na   view   is   also   endorsed   in   judicial   decisions.\nIn\n\nNamit   Sharma   Vs.   Union   of   India\n,   (2013)   1   SCC   745\n\n(per Swatanter Kumar, J.) this Court observed:­\n\n“43. The rule of equality or equal protection\ndoes   not   require   that   a   State   must   choose\nbetween   attacking   every   aspect   of   a   problem\nor   not   attacking   the   problem   at   all,   and\nparticularly   with   respect   to   social   welfare\nprogramme.   So  long   as  the  line  drawn  by  the\nState   is   rationally   supportable,   the   courts\nwill   not   interpose   their   judgment   as   to   the\nappropriate stopping point.…........”\n\n376.  Thus, the legislature is within its remit to only\n\ntarget   individual   assessees   with\nSection   139\n­AA,   and\n\nnot every other tax­paying entity.   The law does not\n\nhave   to   provide   for   complete   coverage of   tax­payers\n\nwho   may   be   indulging   in   financial   fraud   but   may\n\nenvisage 'degrees of harm' and act on that basis.   In\n\nthis context, the Aadhaar number is being mandated for\n\nall   individual   assessees.     This   is   applicable   to\n\nnatural   persons   as   well   as   persons   who   together\n\nconstitute   legal   persons   (e.g.   Partners   in   a\n\npartnership,   members   of   a   company   etc.)   and   hence\n\nprovides   significant   coverage   to   weed   out   duplicate\n\nPANs   and   hence   reduce   the   incidence   of   financial   and\ntax   frauds   through   these   means.     Aadhaar's   inclusion\n\ninto   PAN   is   meant   to   curb   tax   evasion,   sham\n\ntransactions,   entry   providers   which   are   rampantly\n\ncarried   out   on   account   of   bogus   PANs.     Aadhaar's\n\nunique   de­duplication   based   on   biometric\n\nidentification   has   been   hailed   as   the   most\n\nsophisticated system by the World Bank.   Inclusion of\n\nAadhaar   into   PAN   eliminates   the   inequality   between\n\nhonest   tax   payers   and   non­compliant,   dishonest   ones\n\nwho   get   away   without   paying   taxes.     Inclusion   of\n\nAadhaar   into   PAN   promotes   rather   than   negates\n\nequality.  It bolsters equality and is consistent with\n\nArticle 14.\n\n377.   In result,\nSection 139\n­AA is fully compliant of\n\nthree­fold   test   as\nlaid   down   in\nPuttaswamy's  case.\n\nSection 139\n­AA, thus does not breach fundamental Right\n\nof Privacy of an individual and\nSection 139\n­AA cannot\n\nbe struck down on that ground.\n\nAns.17:­\nSection   139\n­AA   does   not   breach   fundamental\n\nRight   of   Privacy   as   per   Privacy   Judgment   in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase.\nIssue No. 18 Whether   Aadhaar   Act   violates   the\nInterim   Orders   passed   by   this   Court\nin   Writ   Petition   (C)   No.   494   of\n2012?\n\n378.     The   petitioners   submits   that   this   Court   has\n\npassed various Interim Orders in Writ Petition (C) No.\n\n494   of   2012   from   23.09.2013   to   15.10.2015.     On\n\n23.09.2013, this Court directed “In the meanwhile, no\n\nperson   should   suffer   not   getting   the   Aadhaar   card\n\ninspite of the  fact that some authority had issued  a\n\ncircular   making   it   mandatory   and   when   any   person\n\napplies to get the Aadhaar Card voluntarily, it may be\n\nchecked   whether   that   person   is   entitled   for   it   under\n\nthe   law   and   it   should   not   be   given   to   any   illegal\n\nimmigrant”.\n\n379.   On   11.08.2015,   this   Court   issued   following\n\norder:­\n\n“Having considered the matter, we are of the\nview   that   the   balance   of   interest   would   be\nbest   served,   till   the   matter   is   finally\ndecided   by   a   larger   Bench   if   the   Union   of\nIndia   or   the   UIDA   proceed   in   the   following\nmanner:­\n1.   The   Union   of   India   shall   give   wide\npublicity   in   the   electronic   and   print   media\nincluding   radio  and  television   networks  that\nit   is  not  mandatory  for  a  citizen  to   obtain\nan Aadhaar card;\n\n2. The production of an Aadhaar card will not\nbe   condition   for   obtaining   any   benefits\notherwise due to a citizen;\n\n3.   The   Unique   Identification   Number   or   the\nAadhaar   card   will   not   be   used   by   the\nrespondents   for   any   purpose   other   than   the\nPDS Scheme and in particular for the purpose\nof   distribution   of   foodgrains,   etc.   and\ncooking   fuel,   such   as   kerosene.   The   Aadhaar\ncard may also be used for the purpose of the\nLPG Distribution Scheme;\n\n4.   The   information   about   an   individual\nobtained   by   the   Unique   Identification\nAuthority   of   India   while   issuing   an   Aadhaar\ncard shall not be used for any other purpose,\nsave as above, except as may be directed by a\nCourt   for   the   purpose   of   criminal\ninvestigation.”\n\nBy   subsequent   order   of   15.10.2015,   some   more\n\nSchemes were included.\n\n380.   It is submitted that the Central Government and\n\nthe   State   Government   issued   various   notifications\n\nnumbering   139,   requiring   Aadhaar   authentication   for\n\nvarious benefits, subsidies and schemes.  The issuance\n\nof   such   orders   is   in   breach   of   above   Interim   Orders\n\npassed by this Court.\n381.\nIn\nBinoy Viswam\n(supra) an argument was advanced\n\nthat enactment of\nSection 139\n­AA was in breach of the\n\nInterim Order passed in Writ Petition (C)   No. 494 of\n\n2012.  The said argument was considered and in Para 99\n\nit was held as follows:\n\n“99.  Main   emphasis,   however,   is   on   the   plea\nthat   Parliament   or   any   State   Legislature\ncannot   pass   a   law   that   overrules   a   judgment\nthereby   nullifying\nthe   said   decision\n,   that\ntoo   without   removing   the   basis   of   the\ndecision.   This   argument   appears   to   be\nattractive inasmuch as few orders are passed\nby this Court in pending writ petitions which\nare   to   the   effect   that   the   enrolment   of\nAadhaar would be voluntary. However, it needs\nto be kept in mind that the orders have been\npassed in the petitions where Aadhaar Scheme\nfloated   as   an   executive/administrative\nmeasure has been challenged. In those cases,\nthe   said   orders   are   not   passed   in   a   case\nwhere   the   Court   was   dealing   with   a   statute\npassed   by   Parliament.   Further,   these   are\ninterim   orders   as   the   Court   was   of   the\nopinion   that   till   the   matter   is   decided\nfinally   in   the   context   of   right   to   privacy\nissue, the implementation of the said Aadhaar\nScheme   would   remain   voluntary.   In   fact,   the\nmain issue as to whether Aadhaar card scheme\nwhereby   biometric   data   of   an   individual   is\ncollected   violates   right   to   privacy   and,\ntherefore, is offensive of\nArticle 21\nof the\nConstitution or not is yet to be decided. In\nthe   process,   the   Constitution   Bench   is   also\ncalled upon to decide as to whether right to\nprivacy   is   a   part   of\nArticle   21\nof   the\nConstitution   at   all.   Therefore,   no   final\ndecision has been taken. In a situation like\nthis,   it   cannot   be   said   that   Parliament   is\nprecluded from or it is rendered incompetent\nto pass such a law. That apart, the argument\nof the petitioners is that the basis on which\nthe   aforesaid   orders   are   passed   has   to   be\nremoved, which is not done. According to the\npetitioners, it could be done only by making\nthe   Aadhaar   Act   compulsory.   It   is   difficult\nto   accept   this   contention   for   two   reasons:\n\nfirst,   when   the   orders   passed   by   this   Court\nwhich are relied upon by the petitioners were\npassed   when   the   Aadhaar   Act   was not   even\nenacted.   Secondly,   as   already   discussed   in\ndetail   above, the   Aadhaar   Act   and   the   law\ncontained in\nSection 139\n­AA of the Income Tax\nAct   deal   with   two   different   situations   and\noperate in different fields. This argument of\nlegislative   incompetence   also,   therefore,\nfails.”\n\n382.   We have noticed that the Writ Petition (C)   No.\n\n494 of 2012 was filed at the time when Aadhaar Scheme\n\nwas   being   implemented   on   the   basis   of   executive's\n\ninstructions   dated   28.01.2009.     In   the   Writ   Petition\n\nfiled   prior   to   enactment   of   Act,   2016,   challenge   to\n\nAadhaar Scheme was founded on following:­\n\ni. The   requirement   of   making   Aadhaar\nmandatory   for availing   benefits   under\nvarious social service schemes by way of\nan executive order and\nii. Concerns   regarding   the   right   to   privacy\nof   the   individuals,   which   emanated   on\naccount   of   collection   of   biometric   data\nunder   the   Aadhaar   scheme,   which   is\nwithout any legislative backing.\n\n383.\nAadhaar   Act,   2016\ngives   legislative   backing   to\n\nthe   Aadhaar   Scheme.\nThe   Act\ncontains   specific\n\nprovisions   prohibiting   disclosure   of   core   biometric\n\ninformation   collected   in   Aadhaar   enrolment.     It   is\n\nsubmitted that Schemes notified under\nSection 7\nof the\n\nAct   were   on   the   strength   of   Aadhaar   enactment   and\n\ncannot be said to be a violation of interim orders of\n\nthis   Court.   The   submission   that   interim   orders\n\ndirected the Aadhaar to be voluntary, it is submitted\n\nby   the   respondent   that   consent   was   obtained   from\n\nindividuals, who came for enrolment under the Aadhaar\n\nAct. It is submitted that all those, who were enrolled\n\nunder   the   Statutory   Scheme   dated   28.01.2009,   the\n\nconsent   was   given   by   the   individuals   in   verifying\n\ntheir informations.\n\n384.     We,   thus,   conclude   that   Aadhaar   Act   cannot   be\n\nstruck down on the ground that it is in violation of\n\ninterim   orders   passed   by   this   Court   in   Writ   Petition\n\n(C) No. 494 of 2012. Issue No. 18 is answered in\nfollowing manner:­\n\nAns.18:­   The   Aadhaar   Act   does   not   violate   the\n\ninterim   orders   passed   in   Writ   Petition\n\n(C)   No.   494   of   2012   and   other   Writ\n\nPetitions.\n\n385.   I   had   gone   through   the   erudite   and   scholarly\n\nopinion of Justice A.K.Sikri (which opinion is on his\n\nown behalf and on behalf of Chief Justice and Justice\n\nA.M.Khanwilkar)   with   which   opinion   I   broadly   agree.\n\nRule   9   as   amended   by   PMLA   (Second   Amendment)   Rules,\n\n2017 has been struck down by my esteemed brother which\n\nprovision   has   been   upheld   by   me.   My   reasons   and\n\nconclusions are on  the same line  except few where my\n\nconclusions   are   not   in   conformity   with   the   majority\n\nopinion.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:­\n\n386.  In view of above discussions, we arrive at following\n\nconclusions:­\n\n(1) The   requirement   under   Aadhaar   Act   to give\none's   demographic   and   biometric   information\ndoes     not   violate   fundamental   right   of\nprivacy.\n\n(2) The   provisions   of   Aadhaar   Act   requiring\ndemographic   and   biometric   information   from   a\nresident   for   Aadhaar   Number   pass   three­fold\ntest as\nlaid down in\n\nPuttaswamy\n(supra) case,\nhence cannot be said to be unconstitutional.\n\n(3) Collection   of   data,   its   storage   and   use   does\nnot violate fundamental Right of Privacy.\n\n(4)   Aadhaar Act does not create an architecture for\npervasive surveillance.\n\n(5) Aadhaar Act and Regulations provides protection\nand   safety   of   the   data   received   from\nindividuals.\n\n(6)\nSection 7\nof the Aadhaar is constitutional. The\nprovision does not deserve to be struck down on\naccount   of   denial   in   some   cases   of   right   to\nclaim on account of failure of authentication.\n\n(7) The State while enlivening right to food, right\nto   shelter   etc.   envisaged   under\nArticle   21\n\ncannot   encroach   upon   the   right   of   privacy   of\nbeneficiaries   nor   former   can   be   given\nprecedence over the latter.\n(8) Provisions of\nSection 29\nis constitutional and\ndoes not deserves to be struck down.\n\n(9)\nSection   33\ncannot   be   said   to   be\nunconstitutional as it provides for the use of\nAadhaar data base for police investigation nor\nit can be   said to violate protection granted\nunder\nArticle 20(3).\n\n(10) Section 47 of the Aadhaar Act cannot be held to\nbe  unconstitutional on the ground that it does\nnot  allow an individual who finds that there is\na   violation   of   Aadhaar   Act   to   initiate   any\ncriminal process.\n\n(11)\nSection 57\n, to the extent, which permits use of\nAadhaar by the State or any body corporate or\nperson,   in   pursuant   to   any   contract   to   this\neffect is unconstitutional and void.  Thus, the\nlast   phrase   in   main   provision   of\nSection   57\n,\ni.e. “or any contract to this effect” is struck\ndown.\n\n(12)\nSection   59\nhas   validated   all   actions   taken   by\nthe Central Government under the notifications\ndated   28.01.2009     and   12.09.2009   and   all\nactions   shall   be   deemed   to   have   been   taken\nunder the Aadhaar Act.\n(13) Parental   consent   for   providing   biometric\ninformation   under\nRegulation   3\n&   demographic\ninformation   under\nRegulation   4\nhas   to   be   read\nfor enrolment of children between 5 to 18 years\nto uphold the constitutionality of Regulations\n3   &   4   of   Aadhaar   (Enrolment   and   Update)\nRegulations, 2016.\n\n(14) Rule   9   as   amended   by   PMLA   (Second   Amendment)\nRules,   2017   is   not   unconstitutional   and   does\nnot violate\nArticles 14\n, 19(1)(g)\n, 21\n\n& 300A\nof\nthe Constitution and Sections 3, 7 & 51 of the\nAadhaar Act.  Further Rule 9 as amended is not\nultra vires to\nPMLA Act, 2002\n.\n\n(15) Circular   dated   23.03.2017   being\nunconstitutional is set aside.\n\n(16) Aadhaar   Act   has   been   rightly   passed   as   Money\nBill.     The   decision   of   Speaker   certifying   the\nAadhaar Bill, 2016 as Money Bill is not immuned\nfrom Judicial Review.\n\n(17)\nSection   139\n­AA   does   not   breach   fundamental\nRight   of   Privacy   as   per   Privacy   Judgment   in\n\nPuttaswamy\ncase.\n(18) The   Aadhaar   Act   does   not   violate   the   interim\norders passed in Writ Petition (C) No. 494 of\n2012 and other Writ Petitions.\n\n387.   Now,   we   revert   back   to   the   batch   of   cases,   which\n\nhave come up for consideration before us.\n\n388.  We having considered and answered the issues arising\n\nin   this   batch   of   cases,   all   the   Writ   Petitions   filed\n\nunder\nArticle 32\ndeserves to be disposed of in accordance\n\nwith   our   conclusions   as   noted   above.     All   Transfer\n\nCases/Transfer Petitions are also deserves to be decided\n\naccordingly.\n\n389.   Now, we come to the Criminal Appeal arising out of\n\nS.L.P. (Crl.) No. 2524 of 2014.   The above S.L.P. (Crl.)\n\narose out of an order passed by Judicial Magistrate First\n\nClass dated 22.10.2013 by which Judicial Magistrate First\n\nClass   directed   DG,   UIDAI   and   Dy.   Dg.   UIDAI   Technology\n\nCentre,   Bangalore   to   provide   the   necessary   data   to   the\n\nrespondent C.B.I.   The said order was challenged in the\n\nHigh Court by means of Criminal Writ Petition, in which\n\nthe   order   was   passed   by   the   High   Court   on   26.02.2014\n\ngiving rise to S.L.P. (Crl.) No. 2524 of 2014.\n390.  We have noticed above that according to Aadhaar Act\n\nSection 33\ndisclosure of information can be made as per\n\nsub­section   (1)   pursuant   to   an   order   of   Court,   not\n\ninferior to that of District Judge.   The order directing\n\nfor   disclosure   of   information   having   been   passed   by\n\nJudicial Magistrate First Class, in the present case, the\n\norder   is   not   in   consonance   with   sub­section   (1)   of\n\nSection   33\n,   hence   the   order   passed   by   Judicial\n\nMagistrate, First Class dated 22.10.2013 and order of the\n\nHigh Court passed in reference to the said order deserves\n\nto be set aside.  Criminal Appeal is allowed accordingly.\n\n391.     No   case   is   made   out   to   initiate   any   contempt\n\nproceedings   in   the   contempt   applications   as   prayed   for.\n\nAll the contempt petitions are dismissed.\n\n392.   In   result,   this   batch   of   cases   is   decided   in\n\nfollowing manner:­\n\n(i) All the Writ Petitions filed under\nArticle 32\n\nas well as Transfer Cases are disposed of as\n\nper our conclusions recorded above.\n(ii) Criminal   Appeal   arising   out   of   S.L.P.\n\n(Criminal) No. 2524 of 2014 is allowed.\n\n(iii) All the contempt applications are closed.\n\n393.  Before we part, we record our deep appreciation for\n\nthe   industry,   hard   work   and   eloquence   shown   by   learned\n\ncounsel   for   the   parties   appearing   before   us,   which   was\n\namply   demonstrated   in   their   respective   arguments.\n\nLearned   counsel   have   enlightened   us   with   all   relevant\n\nconcerned materials available in this country and abroad.\n\nThe   concern   raised   by   these   Public   Interest   Litigations\n\nis   a   concern   shown   for   little   Indian   for   whom   the\n\nSociety, Government and Court exists.   We appreciate the\n\nconcern   and   passion   expressed   before   us   by   learned\n\ncounsel appearing for both the parties as well as those,\n\nwho were permitted to intervene in the matter. We close\n\nby once more recording of our appreciation for the cause\n\nespoused in these cases.\n\n..............................J.\n( ASHOK BHUSHAN )\nNEW DELHI,\nSEPTEMBER 26, 2018.",
