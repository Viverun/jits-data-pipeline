For the sake of convenience, the\n 6\n\nfacts obtaining in Civil Revision Petition No.679 of 2025 would be\n\nnarrated.\n\n 2. Heard Sri S.Manjunath, learned counsel appearing for the\n\npetitioner, Sri S.Varun, learned counsel appearing for respondent\n\nNo.1 and Sri Shivaraj N. Arali, learned counsel appearing for\n\nrespondent No.2.\n\n 3. Facts in brief, germane, are as follows:\n\n 3.1. 1st respondent-plaintiff / Housing Development\n\nCorporation is said to have sanctioned a housing loan to the 2nd\n\nrespondent-1st defendant for purchase of an apartment in the\n\napartment project \"The Greens\" of the petitioner-defendant No.2. A\n\nsale agreement, construction agreement and a tripartite agreement\n\ncome to be executed between the 1st respondent-plaintiff, the 2nd\n\nrespondent-1st defendant and the petitioner-2nd defendant on\n\n19-11-2014 and 25-04-2015. As per the said agreements, the\n\npetitioner-defendant No.2 was required to retain possession of the\n\napartment purchased by the 2nd respondent-1st defendant until the\n 7\n\ncompletion of the project. The petitioner-defendant No.2 was\n\nthereafter required to execute a registered sale deed in favour of\n\nthe 2nd respondent-1st defendant. As per the terms of the tripartite\n\nagreement, the petitioner-defendant No.2 could not have cancelled\n\nthe allotment or refused to execute a registered sale deed in favour\n\nof the 2nd respondent-1st defendant, without obtaining a no-\n\nobjection certificate from the 1st respondent-plaintiff. However, the\n\npetitioner-defendant No.2 executes a registered sale deed in favour\n\nof respondent No.3-defendant No.3 in respect of the apartment\n\npurchased by 2nd respondent-1st defendant. Therefore, the 1st\n\nrespondent-plaintiff files a suit in Commercial O.S. No.145 of 2023\n\nseeking specific performance of the tripartite agreement and a\n\ndirection directing the petitioner-defendant No.2 to execute a\n\nregistered sale deed in favour of the 2nd respondent-1st defendant\n\nand to declare the sale deed dated 10-03-2020 executed by the\n\npetitioner-2nd defendant in favour of the 3rd respondent-3rd\n\ndefendant to be null and void.\n\n3.2. The petitioner/2nd defendant files its written statement\n\ncontending that there was no cause of action against the present\n 8\n\npetitioner, as the 1st defendant had failed to pay the entire sale\n\nconsideration. Therefore, the agreement stood cancelled and after\n\nsuch cancellation, a sale deed was executed in favour of defendant\n\nNo.3. The 1st defendant/2nd respondent herein also files his written\n\nstatement, and along with the written statement, files a\n\ncounterclaim not only against the plaintiff, but also against\n\ndefendant No.2, the co-defendant. By way of counterclaim, the 1st\n\ndefendant sought multiple reliefs including declaration of obligations\n\nagainst the 2nd defendant under the agreements. The petitioner-\n\ndefendant No.2 files an application in I.A. No.24 to reject the\n\ncounter claim, on the score that a counter claim against a co-\n\ndefendant is not maintainable. The application so filed by the\n\npetitioner comes to be rejected. Therefore, the petitioner-defendant\n\nNo.2 is now before this Court in the subject petitions.\n\n 4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would\n\nvehemently contend that a counterclaim is not maintainable against\n\na co-defendant. He would seek to place reliance upon the judgment\n\nof the Apex Court in the case of ROHIT SINGH v. STATE OF\n\nBIHAR reported in (2006) 12 SCC 734 and the judgment of the\n 9\n\nPunjab and Haryana High Court in the case of ASHOK KUMAR\n\nSHARMA v. RAKESH KUMAR SHARMA reported in 2024 SCC\n\nOnLine P & H 4859 to buttress his submission that counterclaim\n\nagainst a co-defendant is not entertainable.\n\n 5. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the 1st\n\nrespondent would vehemently refute the submissions in contending\n\nthat the petitioner has to first cross the threshold bar of\n\nmaintainability of the petition. It is his submission that a revision\n\npetition against an interlocutory order passed by the Commercial\n\nCourt under \nSection 8\n of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ('the Act'\n\nfor short) cannot be held to be maintainable and if the revision is\n\nnot maintainable, none of the submissions of the petitioner should\n\nmerit any consideration. In the event this Court would hold that\n\nrevision is maintainable, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent\n\nwould seek to place reliance upon the judgment of the Apex Court\n\nin the case of RAJUL MANOJ SHAH v. KIRANBHAI\n\nSHAKRABHAI PATEL reported in 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1958 and\n\nROHIT SINGH to buttress his submission that counterclaim against\n\na co-defendant if it touches upon the rights of the plaintiff would be\n 10\n\nmaintainable. He would contend that the judgment rendered by the\n\nPunjab and Haryana High Court is long before the judgment of the\n\nApex Court and, therefore, the judgment of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of RAJUL MANOJ SHAH would prevail. The learned counsel\n\nrepresenting the 2nd respondent-1st defendant would also toe the\n\nlines of the learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent in\n\ncontending that petitions are not maintainable and even if it they\n\nare held to be maintainable, he would adopt the submissions of the\n\n1st respondent.\n\n 6. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions\n\nmade by the respective learned counsel and have perused the\n\nmaterial on record. In the light of the submissions and contra\n\nsubmissions of respective parties, the following issues fall for my\n\nconsideration:\n\n (i) Whether the revision against interlocutory orders\n passed by the Commercial Court would be\n maintainable and entertainable?\n\n (ii) Whether the subject petitions can be converted\n into petitions under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution\n of India and issues be decided?\n 11\n\n (iii) Whether a counterclaim is maintainable against a\n co-defendant?\n\nIssue No.1:\n\n (i) Whether the revision against interlocutory orders\n passed by the Commercial Court would be\n maintainable and entertainable?\n\n 7.1. The petitioner has preferred these revision petitions\n\nassailing interlocutory orders rendered by the concerned Court in\n\nthe aforementioned commercial original suits. Since the\n\nrespondents have raised substantial objections touching the very\n\nroot of maintainability, this Court is compelled to now navigate the\n\nstatutory frame work that governs the threshold bar. For the said\n\npurpose, it is necessary to advert to the relevant provisions of the\n\nAct. \nSections 8\n and \n13\n of the Act read as follows:\n\n \"8. Bar against revision application or petition\n against an interlocutory order.--Notwithstanding\n anything contained in any other law for the time being in\n force, no civil revision application or petition shall be\n entertained against any interlocutory order of a\n Commercial Court, including an order on the issue of\n jurisdiction, and any such challenge, subject to the\n provisions of \nSection 13\n, shall be raised only in an appeal\n against the decree of the Commercial Court.\n ... ... ...\n 13. Appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts and\n Commercial Divisions.--(1) Any person aggrieved by the\n 12\n\n judgment or order of a Commercial Court below the level\n of a District Judge may appeal to the Commercial\n Appellate Court within a period of sixty days from the\n date of judgment or order.\n\n (1-A) Any person aggrieved by the judgment or\n order of a Commercial Court at the level of District Judge\n exercising original civil jurisdiction or, as the case may\n be, Commercial Division of a High Court may appeal to\n the Commercial Appellate Division of that High Court\n within a period of sixty days from the date of the\n judgment or order:\n\n Provided that an appeal shall lie from such orders passed\n by a Commercial Division or a Commercial Court that are\n specifically enumerated under \nOrder XLIII of the Code of Civil\n Procedure\n, 1908 (5 of 1908) as amended by this Act and\n \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of\n 1996).\n\n (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law\n for the time being in force or Letters Patent of a High Court, no\n appeal shall lie from any order or decree of a Commercial\n Division or Commercial Court otherwise than in accordance with\n the provisions of this Act.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nA plain yet purposive reading of \nSection 8\n reveals that the\n\nlegislation has consciously employed a sweeping non-obstante\n\nclause of express embargo against entertaining any civil revision\n\napplication or petition directed against an interlocutory order of a\n\nCommercial Court. The provision mandates that any challenge to\n\nsuch order must await the stage of appeal directed against the\n 13\n\ndecree, subject to the conditions in \nSection 13\n of the Act. \nSection\n\n13\n deals with appeals from decrees of Commercial Courts. Any\n\nperson aggrieved by a judgment or order of a Commercial Court\n\nexercising original civil jurisdiction as the case may be, may appeal\n\nto the Commercial Appellate Division of the High Court.\n\n 7.2. In the present case, the interlocutory orders impugned\n\nconcern rejection of application under \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\n\npreferred in both Commercial O.S.No.145 of 2023 and Commercial\n\nO.S.No.146 of 2023, whereby, the petitioner - defendant No.2 have\n\nsought rejection of the counter claim set up by defendant No.1 on\n\nthe ground that counter claim is not entertainable against a co-\n\ndefendant. Had these proceedings arisen in the regime of a regular\n\ncivil suit, a revision petition challenging the order refusing to reject\n\na plaint or counter claim under Order VII Rule 11(d) might have\n\nwell been maintainable. However, the statutory landscape under\n\nthe Act is distinct, the statutory bar under \nSection 8\n is unequivocal\n\nleaving little interpretative wiggle room. The question therefore\n\nbecomes imperative whether on such statutory inhibition the Court\n\nmay nonetheless entertain such challenge. The question is no\n 14\n\nlonger res integra. A Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi in\n\nthe case of BLACK DIAMOND TRACKPARTS PRIVATE LIMITED\n\nv. BLACK DIAMOND MOTORS PRIVATE LIMITED1, has held as\n\nfollows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 9. The question of maintainability of a petition under\n \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India, with respect to\n proceedings in a commercial suit before the District Judge\n (Commercial) arose, because \nSection 8\n of the Commercial\n Courts Act as under:\n\n \"8. Bar against revision application or\n petition against an interlocutory order.--\n Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law\n for the time being in force, no civil revision application\n or petition shall be entertained against any\n interlocutory order of a Commercial Court, including an\n order on the issue of jurisdiction, and any such\n challenge, subject to the provisions of \nsection 13\n, shall\n be raised only in an appeal against the decree of the\n Commercial Court.\"\n\n 10. Expressly bars the remedy of \"civil revision\n application or petition\". It was deemed apposite to hear the\n counsels on, whether by use of the word \"petition\" in addition to\n the words \"civil revision application\", though with a \"or\"\n between them, the purport of \nSection 8\n supra was to also bar\n the remedy of \nArticle 227\n petition with respect to proceedings in\n a commercial suit at the level of the District Judge. The remedy\n under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India, it was felt, was\n similar/identical/at par with the remedy of a civil revision\n application under \nSection 115\n of the CPC and it was thus\n deemed appropriate to frame the question no. (i) aforesaid and\n hear the counsels thereon. Similarly, it was deemed apposite to\n hear the counsels on the reasoning which prevail with the Single\n Judge, that since appeals against orders in a commercial suit at\n\n1\n 2021 SCC OnLine Del 3946\n 15\n\nthe level of the District Judge are to be heard by the\nCommercial Appellate Division, petitions under \nArticle 227\n, if\nmaintainable, emanating from proceedings in such suits should\nalso be heard by the Commercial Appellate Division.\nAccordingly, question no. (ii) aforesaid was framed.\n\n 11. The senior counsel for the respondent in CM (M) No.\n132/2021, in our view, has rightly contended and none of the\nother counsels have controverted, that the remedy under \nArticle\n227\n being a constitutional remedy could not be affected by a\nstatute framed by a legislature which was itself a creature of\nconstitution. A creature of the Constitution of India cannot\nact in negation of the provisions of the Constitution of\nIndia. We are reminded of Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander\nRai (2003) 6 SCC 675, concerned with the impact of the\namendment in \nSection 115\n of the CPC brought about by\nthe amendment \nof the CPC\n with effect from 1st July, 2002.\nIn the wake of the said amendment, a question arose,\nwhether on such amendment restricting/limiting the\norders of the subordinate courts with respect to which a\nrevision application under \nSection 115\n of the CPC could\nbe preferred to the High Court, an aggrieved person was\ncompletely deprived of the remedy of judicial review\nunder \nArticle 227\n also. It was held, that curtailment of\nrevisional jurisdiction of the High Court did not take away\nand could not have taken away the constitutional\njurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of certiorari\nto a civil court, nor was the power of superintendence\nconferred on the High Court under \nArticle 227\n of the\nConstitution taken away or whittled down. It was further\nheld that the said power continued to exists,\nuntrammelled by the amendment in \nSection 115\n CPC and\nremained available to be exercised, subject to the rules of\nself-discipline and practice, which were well settled.\nSimilarly, in State of Gujarat v. VakhatsinghjiVajesinghji,\nVaghela AIR 1968 SC 1481, Jetha Bai and Sons, Jew\nTown, Cochin v. SunderbasRathenai (1988) 1 SCC\n722, State of H.P. v. DhanwantSingh (2004) 13 SCC\n331 and Union of India v. Major General Shri Kant\nSharma (2015) 6 SCC 773 it was held that the legislature\ncannot take away the power of superintendence of the\nHigh Court under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution over all\nCourts and Tribunals which are within the territories in\n 16\n\nrelation to which the High Court exercises its jurisdiction.\nRather, in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India (1997) 3 SCC\n261, judicial review including under \nArticle 227\n, was held to be a\nbasic feature of the Constitution, even beyond the realm of\namendability and Clause 2(d) of \nArticle 323A\n and Clause 3(d) of\n\nArticle 323B\n, to the extent excluded the jurisdiction of the High\nCourt and Supreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of the\nConstitution with respect to matters falling within the\njurisdiction of the Courts and Administrative Tribunals referred\nto therein, were held to be unconstitutional.\n\n 12. Thus, the question no. (i) aforesaid is answered\nby holding that the petition under \nArticle 227\n of the\nConstitution of India to the High Court with respect to\norders of the Commercial Courts at the level of the\nDistrict Judge is maintainable and the jurisdiction and\npowers of the High Court has not been and could not have\nbeen affected in any manner whatsoever by \nSection 8\n of\nthe Commercial Courts Act. The use of the word\n\"petition\" in \nSection 8\n is not and could not have been\nwith reference to a petition under \nArticle 227\n of the\nConstitution and is with reference to a revision\napplication/revision petition only.\n ... ... ...\n 31. We are of the view that once the \nCommercial Courts\nAct\n has expressly barred the remedy of a revision application\nunder \nSection 115\n of the CPC, with respect to the suits within its\nambit, the purpose thereof cannot be permitted to be defeated\nby opening up the gates of \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of\nIndia. The scope and ambit of a petition under \nArticle 227\n\nis much wider than the scope and ambit of a revision\napplication under \nSection 115\n of the CPC; whatever can\nbe done in exercise of powers under \nSection 115\n of the\nCPC, can also be done in exercise of powers under \nArticle\n227\n of the Constitution. Allowing petitions under \nArticle\n227\n to be preferred even against orders against which a\nrevision application under \nSection 115\n CPC would have\nbeen maintainable but for the bar of \nSection 8\n of the\nCommercial Courts Act, would nullify the legislative\nmandate of the \nCommercial Courts Act\n. Recently, in Deep\nIndustries Limited v. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation\nLimited (2020) 15 SCC 706, in the context of petitions under\n 17\n\n \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India with respect to orders in\n an appeal against an order of the Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection\n 17\n of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, it was held that if\n petitions under Article 226/227 of the Constitution against\n orders passed in appeals under the \nArbitration Act\n were\n entertained, the entire arbitral process would be derailed and\n would not come to fruition for many years. It was observed that\n though \nArticle 227\n is a constitutional provision which remains\n untouched by an non-obstante Clause 5 of the \nArbitration Act\n\n but what is important to note is that though petitions can be\n filed under \nArticle 227\n against judgments allowing or dismissing\n First Appeals under the \nArbitration Act\n, yet the High Court would\n be extremely circumspect in interfering with the same taking\n into account the statutory policy, so that interference is\n restricted to orders which are patently lacking in inherent\n jurisdiction. Thus, though we are of the view that gates of\n \nArticle 227\n ought not to be opened with respect to orders in\n commercial suits at the level of the District Judge against which\n a revision application under \nCPC\n was maintainable but which\n remedy has been taken away by the \nCommercial Courts Act\n, but\n abiding by the judgments aforesaid, hold that it cannot be said\n to be the law that jurisdiction under \nArticle 227\n is completely\n barred. However the said jurisdiction is to be exercised very\n sparingly and more sparingly with respect to orders in such suits\n which under \nthe CPC\n were revisable and which remedy has been\n taken away by a subsequent legislation i.e. the \nCommercial\n Courts Act\n, and ensuring that such exercise of jurisdiction by the\n High Court does not negate the legislative intent and purpose\n behind the \nCommercial Courts Act\n and does not come in the\n way of expeditious disposal of commercial suits.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe said judgment of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court, is\n\nfollowed by the High Court of Odisha in the case of NARAYAN\n\nNAIK v. RANJITA NAIK2, wherein it is held as follows:\n\n2\n 2025 SCC OnLine Ori 2112\n 18\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 17. The provisions of \nSection 8\n of the Commercial\nCourts Act, 2015 cannot operate as an absolute bar to\nexercise of the power under \nArticle 227\n of\nthe Constitution of India. \nSection 8\n despite its initial non-\nobstante clause, cannot operate as an absolute bar to the\nexercise of the power of judicial review by the High\nCourts, which is conferred by the Constitution of\nIndia under \nArticle 227\n thereof, since the 2015 Act is a\nsubordinate legislation under the Constitution, the latter\nbeing the ground norm of the Indian legal system cannot\nobstruct the powers of this Court under\n\nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 18. A creature of the Constitution of India cannot act in\nnegation of the provisions of the Constitution of India. This\nCourt is reminded of Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai1,\nconcerned with the impact of the amendment in\n\nSection 115\n CPC brought about by the amendment \nof\nthe CPC\n with effect from 1-7-2002. In the wake of the said\namendment, a question arose, whether on such amendment\nrestricting/limiting the orders of the subordinate courts with\nrespect to which a revision application under\n\nSection 115\n CPC could be preferred to the High Court, an\naggrieved person was completely deprived of the remedy of\njudicial review under \nArticle 227\n also. It was held, that\ncurtailment of revisional jurisdiction of the High Court did not\ntake away and could not have taken away the constitutional\njurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of certiorari to a\ncivil court, nor was the power of superintendence conferred on\nthe High Court under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution taken away\nor whittled down. It was further held that the said power\ncontinued to exists, untrammelled by the amendment in\n\nSection 115\n CPC and remained available to be exercised,\nsubject to the rules of self-discipline and practice, which were\nwell settled. Similarly, in State of\nGujarat v. VakhatsinghjiVajesinghji Vaghela2, Jetha Bai &\n 3\nSons v. Sunderdas Rathenai , State of H.P. v. Dhanwant\nSingh4 and Union of India v. Shri Kant Sharma5 it was held that\nthe legislature cannot take away the power of Superintendence\nof the High Court under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution over all\n 19\n\ncourts and tribunals which are within the territories in relation to\nwhich the High Court exercises its jurisdiction. Rather, in L.\nChandra Kumar v. Union of India6, judicial review including\nunder \nArticle 227\n, was held to be a basic feature of\nthe Constitution, even beyond the realm of amendability and\nClause 2(d) of \nArticle 323-A\n and Clause 3(d) of \nArticle 323-B\n, to\nthe extent excluded the jurisdiction of the High Court and\nSupreme Court under Articles 226/227 and 32 of\nthe Constitution with respect to matters falling within the\njurisdiction of the courts and Administrative Tribunals referred\nto therein, were held to be unconstitutional.\n\n 19. Parliament has, mandated that no civil revision\napplication or petition shall be entertained against the\ninterlocutory order of Commercial Court. Parliament has taken\ncare to provide that an interlocutory order on the issue of\njurisdiction also cannot be made the subject-matter of challenge\nand any challenge to such order shall be raised only in an\nappeal against the decree of Commercial Court. Having regard\nto the legislative object and the intent of the legislature in\nbarring the remedy of revision, which is otherwise available to a\nparty in civil proceedings, the exercise of writ jurisdiction under\n\nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India, though not ousted, yet\nneeds to be informed by the limited nature of the said\njurisdiction, lest the legislative object of proscribing revision\nwould be defeated if the legality, propriety and correctness of\nevery order passed by the Commercial Court is examined in\nexercise of the supervisory jurisdiction under \nArticle 227\n of\nthe Constitution of India.\n\n 20. Thus this petition under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n of\nthe Constitution of India with respect to orders of the\nCommercial Courts at the level of the District Judge is\nmaintainable and the jurisdiction and powers of the High Court\nhave not been affected in any manner whatsoever by \nSection 8\n\nof the Commercial Courts Act. However, this Court shall\nendeavour to exercise restraint unless the matter warrants\ninterference.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n 20\n\nThe Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi and the single judge\n\nBench of the High Court of Odisha, while analyzing the legislative\n\nintent and the scheme of the Act, hold that the statutory bar\n\nagainst revision under \nSection 8\n of the Act is absolute. Therefore,\n\ninterlocutory orders passed by Commercial Courts is not amenable\n\nto revisional jurisdiction. The High Court of Delhi and the High Court\n\nof Odisha in the afore-quoted judgments observe that jurisdiction\n\nunder \nArticle 227\n can never be taken away by projecting a bar\n\nagainst revision petitions created under \nSection 8\n of the Act. In that\n\nlight, the petitioner, in the case at hand, who has filed the revision\n\npetitions ought to have preferred a petition under \nArticle 227\n of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n 7.3. This Court, on 12-09-2025, had passed an order\n\ndisposing of these petitions on a submission made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner that he would file an appeal. Thereafter,\n\nit was immediately moved contending that the appeal is not\n\nmaintainable and, therefore, the revision petitions would be\n\nmaintainable. Owing to the application so filed by the petitioner,\n\nthis Court passed the following order on 24-09-2025:\n 21\n\n \"ORAL ORDER ON I.A.NO.2 OF 2025\n\n The subject petition was disposed on 12.09.2025 owing to\n the fact that an alternative remedy of filing an appeal was\n available. Learned counsel for petitioner has moved the matter\n on the score that the submission was erroneously made that an\n appeal remedy was available. According to the learned counsel,\n appeal is not a remedy that is available under the Statute and\n would submit that he would convince the Court.\n\n In that light, application is allowed and the order dated\n 12.09.2025 stands recalled and petition is restored to file.\n\n Tag this petition along with CRP No.680 of 2025 and list\n the matters on 14.10.2025 to hear the learned counsel for\n petitioner and the respondents, further.\n\n In the light of interim order subsisting in the connected\n case, there shall be an interim order, in the subject petition as\n well, till the next date of hearing.\"\n\nNo doubt, an appeal as obtaining under \nSection 13\n of the Act would\n\nnot be maintainable, as it is only against a decree passed by the\n\nCommercial Court. However, as held by the High Court of Delhi\n\nfollowed by the High Court of Odisha, to which I am in complete\n\nagreement of, the revision petition cannot be entertained. The\n\npetitioner will have to prefer a petition under \nArticle 227\n of the\n\nConstitution of India and not a revision petition under \nSection 115\n\nof the CPC. Therefore, I hold that revision petitions will not be\n\nmaintainable against interlocutory orders passed by the Commercial\n\nCourt under \nSection 8\n of the Act.\n\n 22\n\nIssue No.2:\n\n (ii) Whether the subject petitions can be converted\n into petitions under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution\n of India and issues be decided?\n\n 8.1. Having thus concluded that the present revision petitions\n\nare not maintainable within the statutory contours of \nSection 8\n of\n\nthe Act, the issue now would be, whether this Court may in the\n\ninterest of justice, treat the present proceedings, as petitions\n\ninvoking the supervisory jurisdiction, of this Court under \nArticle 227\n\nof the Constitution of India. Such treatment is neither novel nor\n\nunprecedented. The power of the High Court under \nArticle 227\n of\n\nthe Constitution of India, exists independent of and unaffected by\n\nstatutory curtailments applicable to the revisional jurisdiction under\n\nthe CPC\n. The Apex Court in the case of COL.ANIL KAK (RETD.) v.\n\nMUNICIPAL CORPORATION, INDORE3, has held as follows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 2. All that the High Court has done is to treat the petition\n filed before it under Section 115 of the Code as a proceeding\n initiated under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution. The respondents\n had filed the revision originally and during the pendency of that\n revision the High Court appears to have taken a view that an\n order in an appeal arising from a proceeding under Order 39\n\n3\n\n (2005) 12 SCC 734\n\n 23\n\n Rules 1 and 2 of the Code, could not be challenged under\n Section 115 of the Code since the order was in the nature of an\n interlocutory order. In such a situation, in our view, the\n High Court rightly decided to permit the revision\n petitioners before it, to convert the same as a proceeding\n under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution. After all, the court\n could have done it on its own, even without a motion in\n that behalf by the petitioner. We see absolutely no\n ground to interfere with the said order on the grounds\n raised in this special leave petition. Hence, this special\n leave petition is dismissed.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court has expounded, that even when statutory\n\nbar expressly curtails revisional or appellate remedies, such\n\nouster cannot be extended to trammel the constitutional\n\npowers of the High Court under \nArticle 226\n or 227 of the\n\nConstitution of India. The Apex Court was considering whether\n\nthe High Court was right in treating a petition filed before it under\n\nSection 115 of the Code as a proceeding under \nArticle 227\n of the\n\nConstitution of India. The High Court had decided the issue by\n\nconverting the revision petition into a petition under \nArticle 227.\n\nThe Apex Court refused to interfere.\n\n 24\n\n \n8.2. A Division Bench of the High Court of Telangana in the\n\ncase of \nNCC LIMITED v. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF\n\nTECHNOLOGY NIT4\n, has held as follows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 15. The issue of maintainability of the present Civil\n Revision Petitions (CRPs) should be answered first.\n\n 16. The bar contained in \nsection 8\n of The\n Commercial Courts Act, 2015 ('the 2015 Act') pertains to\n entertaining Civil Revision Petitions from an interlocutory\n order of a Commercial Court including any order on the\n issue of jurisdiction of the Commercial Court. \nSection 8\n of\n the 2015 Act mandates that a challenge to an\n interlocutory order passed by a Commercial Court shall be\n filed in accordance with the statutory framework of\n \nsection 13\n of the 2015 Act. In other words, the correct route\n would be to file an appeal under \nsection 13(1)\n or (1\nA) of the\n Act\n.\n\n \n17. The Supreme Court in \nShalini Shyam Shetty Vs.\n Rajendra Shankar Patil\n delineated the principles on the exercise\n of the High Court's jurisdiction under \nArticle 227\n of the\n Constitution of India and limited the scope of such power in\n matters of interference in orders of Courts inferior to the High\n Courts. The power to interfere was circumscribed within the\n boundaries of patent perversity, gross or manifest failure of\n justice or violation of the principles of natural justice. In other\n words, the Supreme Court held that the power of\n superintendence should be sparingly exercised only in fit cases\n i.e., to keep strict administrative control of the Courts within the\n territory of the High Court.\n\n4\n\n Civil Revision Petition Nos. 2714, 2715 and 2716 of 2024 decided\non 29-04-2025\n\n 25\n\n \n18. A Division Bench of this High Court in \nM.V.Ramana\nRao Vs. N.Subash\n considered the issue of maintainability of a\nCRP against the embargo contained in the 2015 Act and diluted\nthe stricture contained therein by drawing a distinction between\nthe power of revision under section 115 of The \nCode of Civil\nProcedure\n, 1908 ('\nCPC\n') and under \nArticle 227\n of the\nConstitution of India. The High Court held that the power of\njudicial review under \nArticle 227\n cannot be taken away by\n\nsection 8\n of the 2015 Act but cautioned against misuse of\nthe power in undeserving cases. A Division Bench of the\nHigh Court of Andhra Pradesh expressed the same\nopinion i.e., \nsection 8\n of the 2015 Act is confined to a CRP\nfiled under \nsection 115\n of the CPC and does not operate\nas a bar to the jurisdiction of a High Court under \nArticle\n227\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n 19. \nIn \nBlue Cube Germany Assets Gmbh And Co. KG Vs.\nVivimed Labs Limited\n, a Division Bench of the erstwhile High\nCourt of Judicature at Hyderabad for the State of Telangana and\nAndhra Pradesh clarified that although the nomenclature given\nby the Court under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India is\n'Civil Revision Petition' it is not equivalent to a Revision Petition\nunder \nsection 115\n of the CPC. It was further clarified that\nthe power of judicial superintendence vested in a High\nCourt under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution cannot be\nequated to ordinary revisional jurisdiction. The Court also\nclarified that the petitions filed under \nArticle 227\n in\nseveral High Courts are not referred to as 'Civil Revisions'\nbut as 'Writ Petitions (Civil)'. In other words, the Division\nBench held that the nomenclature of 'Civil Revision\nPetition' to petitions filed under \nArticle 227\n would not fall\nwithin the statutory bar in \nsection 8\n of the 2015 Act.\n\n 20. The discussion becomes somewhat academic in view\nof the Supreme Court's decision in Col. Anil Kak (Retd.) Vs.\nMunicipal Corporation, Indore where it was held that a High\nCourt is authorized to convert a petition filed under\n\nsection 115\n of the CPC to a proceeding under \nArticle 227\n\nof the Constitution on its own even without a motion in\nthat behalf by the petitioner before it.\n\n 21. Therefore, the argument of the respondent that the\nCRPs are not maintainable in view of the bar in \nsection 8\n of the\n\n 26\n\n 2015 Act cannot be accepted. We accordingly hold that the CRPs\n are maintainable.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Division Bench of the High Court of Telangana follows the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of ANIL KAK supra. The\n\nDivision Bench also was faced with the circumstance of non-\n\nmaintainability of revision petition filed against an interlocutory\n\norder under \nSection 8\n of the Commercial Courts Act. The Division\n\nBench holds that filing of a petition under \nSection 115\n CPC does not\n\noperate as a bar to the jurisdiction of a High Court under \nArticle\n\n227\n of the Constitution of India, but however in the facts holds that\n\ncivil revision petition is maintainable.\n\n 8.3. Driving back to the cases at hand, as observed\n\nhereinabove, the petitions are filed under \nSection 115\n of the CPC\n\nprojecting them to be revision petitions against an order rejecting\n\nthe counterclaim under \nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\n. In the light\n\nof the law laid down by the Apex Court, which is followed by the\n\nDivision Bench of the High Court of Telangana under identical\n\ncircumstance, I deem it appropriate to answer the core issue in the\n\n 27\n\ncases at hand, by converting the subject petitions, to that of\n\npetitions under \nArticle 227\n of the Constitution of India. I therefore,\n\nanswer the issue accordingly.\n\nIssue No.3:\n\n (iii) Whether a counterclaim is maintainable against a\n co-defendant?\n\n 9.1. The subject issue forms the kernel of the conundrum.\n\nThis concerns the issue of maintainability of a counterclaim directed\n\nagainst a co-defendant. The plaintiff is HDFC Bank. The plaintiff\n\ninstitutes the suits in Commercial O.S.Nos.145 of 2023 and 146 of\n\n2023 for specific performance of a tripartite agreement which\n\ndirects the present petitioner to execute a sale deed in favour of the\n\n1st defendant. The second prayer in both suits is to declare the sale\n\ndeeds dated 10-03-2020 and 13-03-2020 executed by the present\n\npetitioner in favour of the 3rd defendant to be null and void. The 3rd\n\nprayer is to declare that the plaintiff has exclusive charge over the\n\nsuit schedule property. The cause of action that leads to the\n\ninstitution of both the suits is that the petitioner/developer has an\n\nagreement with the homebuyer and the plaintiff-Bank, but the\n\n 28\n\ndeveloper sells the property to defendant No.3 during the\n\nsubsistence of a mortgage between the other two. Two suits spring\n\non identical cause of action between these parties as there were\n\ntwo transactions. Defendants 1 and 2 filed separate written\n\nstatements. While so doing, the 1st defendant files a counter claim\n\nagainst the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant. Therefore, the issue is\n\nwhether the counterclaim of defendant No.1 against the 2nd\n\ndefendant was maintainable. The actions then spring - one from\n\nthe hands of the plaintiff, the HDFC Bank and the other from the\n\nhands of the present petitioner/defendant No.2, the developer. The\n\nconcerned Court on the following reasons rejects both the\n\napplications. The reasons so rendered insofar as they are germane,\n\nin Commercial O.S.No.145 of 2023, are as follows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 26. But, in the humble opinion of this court, this case law\n also cannot be relied upon and applied by this court. Because,\n this decision also is not rendered on the order passed on the\n application filed under order VII rule 11 \nof CPC\n. It is rendered\n on the order passed on the application filed under \nsection 10\n of\n CPC. As mentioned above, in this decision, also, it is not the\n observation of Hon'ble High court that in such case, the counter\n claim of the defendant shall be resulted in the rejection of plaint\n invoking order 7 rule 11 \nof CPC\n. The question before the said\n court was also not whether the defendant can make a counter\n claim against the co-defendant or not. The question was as to\n whether there is application of \nsection 10\n of CPC to the facts\n\n 29\n\nand circumstances of the said case or not. This can be easily\nmake out from the observations of the Hon'ble High Court in\npara no.11 of the said judgment. It is clearly observed in the\nsaid para that the interse dispute between the plaintiff and\ndefendant is not a subject matter of earlier suit. They are co-\ndefendants in the earlier suit. The plaintiff cannot file cross suit\nagainst defendant to protect his suit land in the pending first\nappeal and thus present suit is very much maintainable and not\nliable to be stayed.\n\n \n27. Moreover, it is to be noted that in \nRohit Singh Vs\nState of Bihar\n referred supra, with due respect and in the\nhumble opinion of this court, Hon'ble Supreme Court has not\nheld that the counter claim is not maintainable against the co-\ndefendant. As per the observations of the said case, if the\ncounter claim is made solely against co-defendant, then it is not\nmaintainable. If the counter claim-is made incidentally or along\nwith the plaintiff, then it is maintainable. In this regard for\nclarity and brevity and for ready reference, the observation of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme court in para 21 of \nthe said judgment\n is\nextracted hereunder.\n\n 21. Normally, a counter-claim, though based\n on a different cause of action than the one put in\n suit by the plaintiff could be made. But, it appears\n to us that a counter-claim has necessarily to be\n directed against the plaintiff in the suit, though\n incidentally or along with it, it may also claim\n relief against the co-defendants in the suit. But a\n counter-claim directed solely against the co-\n defendants cannot be maintained. By filing a\n counter-claim the litigation cannot be converted\n into some sort of an interpleader suit. Here,\n defendants 3 to 17 had no claim as against the\n plaintiff except that they were denying the right\n put forward by the plaintiff and the validity of the\n document relied on by the plaintiff and were\n asserting a right in themselves. They had no case\n even that the plaintiff was trying to interfere with\n their claimed possession. Their whole case was\n directed against defendants 1 and 2 in the suit and\n they were trying to put forward a claim as against\n the State and were challenging the claim of the\n State that the land involved was a notified forest\n in the possession of the State. Such a counter-\n\n 30\n\n claim, in our view, should not have been\n entertained by the trial court.\n\n \n28. From the above observation of the Hon'ble\nSupreme court it is very clear that there is no bar for the\ndefendant to make a counter claim against the co-\ndefendant if same is directed along with the plaintiff.\nSuch claim may be incidental or along with the plaintiff.\nHowever, such claim solely against the co-defendant\ncannot be maintained. Therefore, the decision relied upon by\nthe defendant No.2 as per decision reported in 2024 SCC on\nline MP 1301 stated supra is also not useful to the defendant\nNo.2. The another decision relied upon by the defendant No.2 is\nthe decision reported in 2024 SCC on line P and H 4859\nrendered in case of \nAshok Kumar Sharma Vs Rakesh Kumar\nSharma and others\n. The defendant No. 2 relying upon\nobservation Hon'ble High Court made in para 18, 19 and 20 of\n\nthe said decision\n contended that the counter claim of the\ndefendant against the co-defendant is not maintainable and\nliable to be rejected under order VII rule 11 \nof CPC\n.\n\n 29. But, again it is significant to note that this\ndecision is also not rendered in the background of the\napplication under order 7 rule 11 \nof CPC\n. The facts and\ncircumstances of this case and the relied case also are\ndifferent and distinguishable. In the present suit, it is to\nbe noted that the plaintiff, defendant No.1 and defendant\nNo.2 have entered into Tripartite Agreement dated\n25/04/2015. There are numerous obligations to be\nperformed by each party as per the said document. Those\nobligations are mutual and ancillary each other. As per\nthe said document each party is entitled for seeking the\nperformance. Admittedly the defendant no.2 has sold the\nsubject flat to the defendant No.3. \nIf it was not sold, even\nthe defendant No. 2 could have been sought for specific\nperformance against the plaintiff and defendant No.1.\nTherefore, the set of facts and circumstances involved in\nthe present case and that of the case relied. by the\ndefendant No.2 are different and distinguishable. Hence\n,\n\nthe said decision\n is also not applicable to the case.\n\n \n30. All the more, it is to be noted even for the sake\nof arguments, it is taken that all the decisions relied upon\n\n 31\n\nby the defendant No.2 are applicable to the case on hand\nand the counter claim of the defendant No.1 is not\nmaintainable, even then, in the opinion of this court, the\napplication filed by the defendant No.2 cannot be allowed\nby this court. Because, none of the decisions relied upon\nby the defendant no.2 lays down the law that if the\ncounter claim is not maintainable, then such the counter\nclaim of the defendant has to be rejected under order VII\nrule 11 \nCPC\n. However, under these circumstances, a\nquestion may arise as to what happens to the counter-\nclaim made by the defendant and how it would effect the\nco-defendant against whom counter-claim is made. It is\nto be noted that answer to this question can be found in\nthe third judgment relied upon by the defendant No.2\nrendered in case of \nAshok kumar Sharma Vs Rakesh\nKumar\n sharma and other stated supra.\n \nIn para 20 of \nthe\nsaid judgment\n the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and\nHariyana relied upon its earlier decision rendered in case\n\nSoma Devi Vs Dashmiri Lal\n reported in 2017 (4) Law\nherald 3362 and held that:\n\n \"In case defendant filed counter claim\n against a co-defendants then co-defendant has not\n been given any right to file written statement to\n the counter claim under order VII rule 6A. Nor has\n a defendant been given any entitlement to make\n an application for exclusion of a counter claim filed\n by co-defendant against him. Nor the default of a\n defendant to file written statement in counter\n claim by a co-defendant, is prescribed as ground\n for pronouncing the judgment against such a co-\n defendant. Even the balance of the relief after\n adjustment of counter claim is not contemplated\n to be granted against the co-defendant by \nthe\n CPC\n.\"\n\n 31. As such from the above observations of the\nHon'ble Punjab and Hariyana High Court, what this court\nconclude is that, if the defendant makes a counter-claim\nwhich is not provided under law, then the co-defendant\nagainst whom the counter claim is made need not\nanswer such counter claim. Under such circumstances,\nthe averments made by way counter claim by the co-\ndefendant become redundant and useless. Ultimately.\n\n 32\n\nwhile deciding the case on merits, the court can give a\nfinding over it. It is to be noted that as per the\ncontentions of the defendant No.2, the law does not\nprovide the defendant No.1 for the filing the counter-\nclaim against the co-defendant/Defendant No.2. If that is\nthe case, at the same time, it has to be noted that law\nalso does not provide for filing application for rejection of\ncounter-claim made against co-defendant. It is to be\nnoted that in the present case, it is not that the counter-\nclaim of the defendant is barred under any law, but is a\ncase where there is no provision for filing the counter\nclaim by the defendant against the co-defendant. Unless\nand until some law prohibits the counter-claim of the co-\ndefendant No.1, this court is bound to take it on record.\nThis court can decide its maintainability its proof, validity\netc., during the trial. The plaintiff and defendant No.2 can\nconvince this court on merits about the counter claim of\nthe defendant no.1 against them. Therefore, under these\ncircumstances, viewed from any angle, at this stage, the\nquestion of rejecting the counter claim of the defendant\nNo.1, against the defendant No.2 or the plaintiff, that too\ninvoking order VII rule 11 \nof CPC\n would not arise at all.\nTherefore, application filed by the defendant No.2 has to be\nrejected. Accordingly, point No.2 is answered in the\nnegative.\n\n 32. Point No. 3: In view of this court's answers to point\nNo. 1 to 3 this Court proceeds to pass the following:\n\n ORDER\n\n IA No.23 filed by the plaintiff under\n Order 7 Rule 11(b) and (d) read with \nSection\n 151\n of CPC and IA-24 filed by the defendant\n No. 2 under order 7 rule 11 \nof CPC\n to reject\n the counter claim of the defendant No.1 are\n hereby rejected.\n\n Call for further chief of Dw1 and 2.\n\n It is notice that since long time the case\n is pending for trial. The parties are making\n the applications one or other. This was also\n\n 33\n\n once posted for argument. Therefore, all the\n parties to the suit are directed to complete\n the proceedings without seeking further\n adjournments.\n\n Call on 04/09/2025.\"\n\n (Emphasis added)\n\nIt is the aforesaid order that has driven the petitioner to this Court\n\nin the subject petitions. What was projected before the concerned\n\nCourt is projected before this Court as well. Therefore, it becomes\n\nnecessary to notice the provision of law viz., Order VIII Rule 6A &\n\n6E \nof the CPC\n, which deal with counter claim and default of plaintiff\n\nto reply to the counter-claim. They read as follows:\n\n \"6A. Counter-claim by defendant.--(1) A defendant\n in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a set-off\n under rule 6, set up, by way of counter-claim against the\n claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in respect of a\n cause of action accruing to the defendant against the\n plaintiff either before or after the filing of the suit but\n before the defendant has delivered his defence or before\n the time limited for delivering his defence has expired,\n whether such counter-claim is in the nature of a claim for\n damages or not:\n\n Provided that such counter-claim shall not exceed the\n pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n (2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as a\n cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final\n judgment in the same suit, both on the original claim and on the\n counter-claim.\n\n 34\n\n (3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written\n statement in answer to the counter-claim of the defendant\n within such period as may be fixed by the court.\n\n (4) The counter-claim shall be treated as a plaint and\n governed by the rules applicable to plaints.\"\n\n \n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nA perusal at Order VIII Rule 6A would in the first blush indicate any\n\ncounterclaim is required to be directed only against the plaintiff and\n\nnot against the defendants. The Apex Court in the case of \nROHIT\n\nSINGH5\n supra interprets the very provision, and holds as follows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 21. Normally, a counterclaim, though based on a\n different cause of action than the one put in suit by the\n plaintiff could be made. But, it appears to us that a\n counterclaim has necessarily to be directed against the\n plaintiff in the suit, though incidentally or along with it, it\n may also claim relief against the co-defendants in the\n suit. But a counterclaim directed solely against the co-\n defendants cannot be maintained. By filing a\n counterclaim the litigation cannot be converted into some\n sort of an interpleader suit. Here, Defendants 3 to 17 had no\n claim as against the plaintiff except that they were denying the\n right put forward by the plaintiff and the validity of the\n document relied on by the plaintiff and were asserting a right in\n themselves. They had no case even that the plaintiff was trying\n to interfere with their claimed possession. Their whole case was\n directed against Defendants 1 and 2 in the suit and they were\n trying to put forward a claim as against the State and were\n challenging the claim of the State that the land involved was a\n notified forest in the possession of the State. Such a\n\n5\n\n (2006) 12 SCC 734\n\n 35\n\n counterclaim, in our view, should not have been entertained by\n the trial court.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Apex Court holds, normally a counter claim though based on\n\ndifferent cause of action than the one put in the suit by the plaintiff,\n\ncould not be made. But, in the case before the Apex Court the\n\ncounterclaim was necessarily directed against the plaintiff though\n\nincidentally along with it, it had a relief claimed against a co-\n\ndefendant. If the relief claimed against co-defendant touches upon\n\na counter claim on the plaintiff, it would become maintainable is\n\nwhat the Apex Court holds.\n\n 9.2. A learned single Judge of this Court interpreting \nOrder\n\nVIII Rule 6A CPC\n in the case of M/s ALLIANCE UNIVERSITY v.\n\nSUDHIR6, has held as follows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 84. Order VIII, Rule 6 A \nof the CPC\n deals with counter-\n claim by defendant. It is as under:\n\n 6A. Counter-claim by defendant:\n\n (1) A defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right\n of pleading a set-off under rule 6, set up, by way\n\n6\n\n 2017 SCC Online Kar 1084\n\n 36\n\n of counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff,\n any right in respect of a cause of action accruing\n to the defendant against the plaintiff either\n before or after the filing of the suit but before the\n defendant has delivered his defence or before the\n time limited for delivering his defence has\n expired, whether such counter-claim is in the\n nature of claim for damages or not:\n\n Provided that such counter-claim shall not\n exceed the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of\n the Court.\n\n (2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as\n a cross-suit as to enable the Court to pronounce\n a final judgment in the same suit, both on the\n original claim and on the counter-claim.\n\n (3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written\n statement in answer to the counter-claim of the\n defendant within such period as may be fixed by\n the Court.\n\n (4) The counter-claim shall he treated as a plaint and\n governed by the rules applicable to plaints.\"\n\n 85. A bare perusal of \nOrder VIII, Rule 6A of the CPC\n\nclearly reveals that the counter-claim is to be filed\n\"against the claim of the plaintiff\". It can be filed with\nregard to \"any right or cause of action accruing to the\ndefendant\", but \"against the plaintiff. That the counter-\nclaim can be filed only \"against the plaintiff\" is further\nborne out by Or. VIII, Rules 6B to 6F \nof the CPC\n. Thus,\nthe counter-claim cannot be filed against any other\nperson or entity who is not the plaintiff. It is, indeed, trite\nto state that the purpose of permitting a counter-claim to\nbe filed in a suit is to lessen multiplicity of litigation.\nSince the suit and the counter-claim are to be tried\ntogether, the common trial permits the same court to\ndecide the issues which may not only be common, but\nalso may be proved by same or similar evidence.\nTherefore, the counter-claim can be filed only qua the\nplaintiff. Of course, it is true that through the counter-\nclaim the defendant is permitted to raise other cause of\naction, besides the ones raised by the plaintiff. But\n\n 37\n\n nonetheless, the focus of the other cause of action still\n has to be \"against the plaintiff\", and not against others.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe learned Judge holds that the counter claim against the\n\ndefendant no doubt can be made, but the cause of action and focus\n\nshould still be against the plaintiff and not the other co-defendant.\n\n 9.3. The Apex Court in the case of RAJUL MANOJ SHAH v.\n\nKIRANBHAI SHAKRABHAI PATEL7, after considering ROHIT\n\nSINGH and the law on the issue has held as follows:\n\n \".... .... ....\n\n 17. Re: Defendant no. 2's claim of specific relief not\n maintainable against appellant: Ld. Sr. Counsel for the\n appellant has argued that in terms of \nOrder VIII Rule 6A of CPC\n,\n a counter-claim must be filed seeking relief against the plaintiff\n and cannot be filed against a co-defendant, for a counter-claim\n must necessarily deal with the defendant's cause of action\n against the plaintiff. On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for the\n respondent submits that the counter-claim seeks two\n substantive reliefs, namely, partition and specific performance.\n Consequently, it is contended that the counter-claim is not\n directed solely against a co-defendant, for, in an independent\n suit seeking the very same reliefs, the appellant would\n necessarily have to be impleaded as a party. The ultimate relief\n sought by defendant no. 2 is a declaration of co-ownership of\n the deceased sister-in-law of plaintiff and a consequent decree\n of specific performance as against that ownership on the basis\n of the agreement of sale.\n\n7\n\n 2025 SCC Online SC 1958\n\n 38\n\n 18. Order VIII, Rule 6A, \nCPC\n enables a defendant to set\nup a counter-claim. Said provision is extracted as below;\n\n 6A. Counter-claim by defendant.--(1) A\n defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of\n pleading a set-off under rule 6, set up, by way of\n counter-claim against the claim of the plaintiff, any right\n or claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to the\n defendant against the plaintiff either before or after the\n filing of the suit but before the defendant has delivered\n his defence or before the time limited for delivering his\n defence has expired, whether such counter-claim is in\n the nature of a claim for damages or not:\n\n Provided that such counter-claim shall not exceed\n the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n (2) Such counter-claim shall have the same effect as\n a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to\n pronounce a final judgment in the same suit,\n both on the original claim and on the counter-\n\n claim.\n\n (3) The plaintiff shall be at liberty to file a written\n statement in answer to the counter-claim of the\n defendant within such period as may be fixed by\n the court.\n\n (4) The counter-claim shall be treated as a plaint and\n governed by the rules applicable to plaints.\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n \n19. As per Rule 6-A(1), a defendant may assert any\nright or claim against the plaintiff before the filing of the\nwritten statement, even if such cause of action is\nunrelated to the plaintiff's suit. The only limitation is that\nthe counter-claim must lie within the pecuniary\njurisdiction of the court. Such a counter-claim is treated\nas a cross-suit and is governed by the rules applicable to\nplaints, including the obligation to disclose the cause of\naction and pay requisite court fees. The legislative intent\nis to avoid multiplicity of proceedings by allowing both\nthe original suit and the counter-claim to be tried and\n\n 39\n\ndisposed of in a single trial, thereby avoiding prolonged\nand protracted litigation as held in \nJag Mohan\nChawla v. Dera Radha Swami Satsang\n.\n\n \n20. Rule 6A provides that counter-claim shall be\nagainst the claim of the plaintiff and such right or claim\nshall be in respect of cause of action accruing to\ndefendant against the plaintiff. This Court in \nRohit\nSingh\n (supra) held;\n\n \"21. Normally, a counterclaim, though based\n on a different cause of action than the one put in\n suit by the plaintiff could be made. But, it appears\n to us that a counterclaim has necessarily to be\n directed against the plaintiff in the suit, though\n incidentally or along with it, it may also claim\n relief against the co-defendants in the suit. But a\n counterclaim directed solely against the co-\n defendants cannot be maintained. By filing a\n counterclaim the litigation cannot be converted\n into some sort of an interpleader suit.....\"\n\n \n21. The above observations have been reiterated with\napproval in subsequent pronouncement in \nDamodharNarayan\nSawale v. Tejrao Bajirao Mhaske\n, by observing as under;\n\n \n\"39. The decision of this Court in \nRohit\n Singh v. State of Bihar\n also assumes relevance in the\n above context. This Court held that a defendant could\n not be permitted to raise counterclaim against co-\n defendant because by virtue of Order 8 Rule 6-A \nCPC\n, it\n could be raised by the defendant against the claim of\n the plaintiff.\"\n\n \n22. In the present case, defendant no. 2 sought to raise a\ncounter-claim primarily for the relief of specific performance of\nagreement dated 21.10.2011 executed in his favour by\ndeceased original defendant no. 1 with respect to her undivided\nshare in the suit property, by a direction to the Nazir, the\nsubstituted representative of defendant no. 1, to execute a sale\ndeed in pursuance of the agreement to sell. The relief of\nspecific performance as sought to be raised by defendant\nno. 2 cannot be set up by way of a counter-claim since\nthe same is not directed against the appellant/plaintiff,\n\n 40\n\n but is instead directed solely against the co-defendant. In\n view of this, defendant no. 2 is held to be disentitled to\n raise prayer of specific performance by way of counter-\n claim. This is simply not permissible, and this position is\n no more res-integra in view of the decision of this Court\n in \nRohit Singh\n (supra).\n\n 23. Defendant no. 2 however submits that he has not\n only claimed the relief of specific performance, but has also\n sought partition of suit property to separate the share he is\n entitled to under the agreement. Defendant must first establish\n a right of claim over the property, which is absent9 till he\n succeeds against the estate of defendant no. 1 and only\n thereafter that the question of setting up a counter claim\n against plaintiff may arise. Thus, the submission that there is\n also a claim for partition must fail for the same reason.\"\n\n \n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n 9.4. A meticulous examination of the Authorities is\n\nindispensable to resolve the present controversy. The Apex Court\n\nin the case of \nROHIT SINGH\n supra holds that a counterclaim by its\n\nvery nature, is a defendants' actionable claim against the plaintiff\n\nand ordinarily cannot be an independent claim against the co-\n\ndefendant. The Apex Court observes that permitting such cross-\n\nlitigation within the same suit would distort the procedural fabric of\n\nthe lis and blur the roles of the plaintiff/s and the defendant/s. In\n\nASHOK KUMAR SHARMA, the Punjab and Haryana Court adopted\n\na similar view. It reaffirmed that a counterclaim directed\n\n 41\n\nexclusively against the co-defendant is not maintainable. On a\n\nplain reading of Order VIII Rule 6-A \nof CPC\n contemplates a\n\ncounterclaim against the plaintiff and not inter se between the\n\ndefendants. The legal position as enunciated in the case of ROHIT\n\nSINGH is reiterated in RAJUL MANOJ SHAH, but with a degree of\n\nrefinement. The Apex Court in RAJUL MANOJ SHAH considers the\n\npurpose and sweep of Order VIIII Rule 6-A \nCPC\n. The Apex Court\n\nholds that, while it is true that a counter claim is primarily intended\n\nas a defendant/s claim against the plaintiff, the mere fact that\n\nreliefs sought against the plaintiff incidentally or necessarily affect a\n\nco-defendant, or incidentally touches upon the claim of the plaintiff,\n\nsuch counterclaim would not become contrary to law. It is trite that\n\nthe counterclaim substantially concerns or implicates the plaintiff.\n\nIf the counter-claim so filed against a co-defendant implicates or\n\nconcerns the plaintiff and not solely the co-defendant, the said\n\ncounterclaim does not vitiate its maintainability. What is\n\nimpermissible in law is a counterclaim exclusively against a\n\nco-defendant, one that bears no nexus to the plaintiff's claim\n\nor the lis between the plaintiff and the defendants.\n\n 42\n\n \n9.5. The Apex Court in the case of RAJUL MANOJ SHAH\n\nsupra considers the judgment in the case of \nROHIT SINGH\n supra\n\nand holds that defendant No.2 sought to raise a counterclaim\n\nprimarily for relief of specific performance of agreement dated 21-\n\n10-2011 executed in favour of defendant No.1. The Apex Court\n\nafter looking into the written statement so set up observes that the\n\nrelief of specific performance as sought to be raised by defendant\n\nNo.2 cannot be set up by way of counterclaim, since the same was\n\nnot directed against the plaintiff but instead directed solely against\n\nthe co-defendant. In that view, the 2nd defendant therein was held\n\nto be disentitled to raise a prayer of specific performance by way of\n\na counter claim against the co-defendant.\n\n 9.6. When the present counterclaim is scrutinized through the\n\nprism of ROHIT SINGH and RAJUL MANOJ SHAH, it becomes\n\nevident that the reliefs sought by the 1st defendant in the\n\ncounterclaim is not in isolation to counter the plaintiff's claim,\n\nrather it is interwoven with the obligations arising out of a tripartite\n\nagreement and consequent rights asserted by the plaintiff. The\n\nallegations and the relief are interconnected; they relate to the\n\n 43\n\ncontractual matrix governing the loan transaction, the construction\n\nagreement and the tripartite agreement, all of which are central to\n\nthe plaintiff's suit. The agreement was between the Bank, the\n\ndeveloper and the home buyer. The developer has sold it to the 3rd\n\ndefendant. Now, by way of counterclaim defendant No.1 seeks to\n\nannul the sale deed made in favour of defendant No.3 as null and\n\nvoid. In the said counterclaim, the prayer is not restricted to\n\ndeclaration of sale deed in favour of defendant No.3 as null and\n\nvoid, but compensation is sought against the plaintiff and defendant\n\nNo.2 jointly and severally and declaration of obligations against\n\ndefendant No.2 under the agreements to be null and void.\n\nTherefore, the counterclaim does touch upon claim against the\n\nplaintiff and does not entirely relate to the co-defendant.\n\n 9.7. If a suit for specific performance is sought at the hands\n\nof the co-defendant, it would have been an altogether different\n\ncircumstance. The prayer is sought against the plaintiff and the co-\n\ndefendant in the counterclaim. The concerned Court, at paragraphs\n\n15 and 16, quotes the prayer in the counterclaim. On a bare\n\nperusal of the prayer, it is clear that the counterclaim is not only\n\n 44\n\ndirected against the co-defendant, but is also against the\n\nplaintiff/HDFC Bank as well. Therefore, no fault can be found with\n\nthe order so passed by the concerned Court, simply for the reason\n\nthat, both in ROHIT SINGH and RAJUL MANOJ SHAH the Apex\n\nCourt holds that the counterclaim has to be directed towards the\n\nplaintiff and may incidentally be made against the defendants.\n\nTherefore, I answer the issue holding that generally Order\n\nVIII Rule 6A is a complete bar for a counter claim to be\n\nraised solely against the co-defendant, but if the relief\n\nsought in the counterclaim would touch upon the claim\n\nagainst the plaintiff as well, it cannot be held to be barred. In\n\nthe case at hand, the prayer in the counterclaim of the 1st\n\ndefendant clearly indicates several facts against the plaintiff as well.\n\nThe commercial Court, while dismissing the applications under\n\nOrder VII Rule 11 CPC\n, has applied the test correctly. As\n\nobserved, the counterclaim in its substance and character is\n\nnot an isolated claim between defendants inter se. It is\n\ninextricably linked to the plaintiff's cause of action and the\n\ncomposite contractual obligations binding the parties. Upon\n\nsuch consideration, this Court finds no infirmity in the reasoning of\n\n 45\n\nthe Commercial Court. The issue is answered holding that the\n\ncounterclaim as framed, is maintainable and does not warrant\n\nrejection under \nOrder VII Rule 11 CPC\n.\n\n 10. Finding no merit in the petitions, the petitions stand\n\nrejected.\n\n Interim order, if any subsisting, shall stand dissolved.\n\n Sd/-\n\n (M.NAGAPRASANNA)\n JUDGE\nBKP\nCT:MJ",

The senior counsel for the respondent in CM (M) No.\n132/2021, in our view, has rightly contended and none of the\nother counsels have controverted, that the remedy under \nArticle\n227\n being a constitutional remedy could not be affected by a\nstatute framed by a legislature which was itself a creature of\nconstitution. A creature of the Constitution of India cannot\nact in negation of the provisions of the Constitution of\nIndia. We are reminded of Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander\nRai (2003) 6 SCC 675, concerned with the impact of the\namendment in \nSection 115\n of the CPC brought about by\nthe amendment \nof the CPC\n with effect from 1st July, 2002.\nIn the wake of the said amendment, a question arose,\nwhether on such amendment restricting/limiting the\norders of the subordinate courts with respect to which a\nrevision application under \nSection 115\n of the CPC could\nbe preferred to the High Court, an aggrieved person was\ncompletely deprived of the remedy of judicial review\nunder \nArticle 227\n also. It was held, that curtailment of\nrevisional jurisdiction of the High Court did not take away\nand could not have taken away the constitutional\njurisdiction of the High Court to issue a writ of certiorari\nto a civil court, nor was the power of superintendence\nconferred on the High Court under \nArticle 227\n of the\nConstitution taken away or whittled down. It was further\nheld that the said power continued to exists,\nuntrammelled by the amendment in \nSection 115\n CPC and\nremained available to be exercised, subject to the rules of\nself-discipline and practice, which were well settled.\nSimilarly, in State of Gujarat v. VakhatsinghjiVajesinghji,\nVaghela AIR 1968 SC 1481, Jetha Bai and Sons, Jew\nTown, Cochin v. SunderbasRathenai (1988) 1 SCC\n722, State of H.P. v.

On the other hand, Ld. Counsel for the\n respondent submits that the counter-claim seeks two\n substantive reliefs, namely, partition and specific performance.\n Consequently, it is contended that the counter-claim is not\n directed solely against a co-defendant, for, in an independent\n suit seeking the very same reliefs, the appellant would\n necessarily have to be impleaded as a party. The ultimate relief\n sought by defendant no. 2 is a declaration of co-ownership of\n the deceased sister-in-law of plaintiff and a consequent decree\n of specific performance as against that ownership on the basis\n of the agreement of sale."
