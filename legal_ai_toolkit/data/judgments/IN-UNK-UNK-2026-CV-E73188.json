The\n\n .\n\n petitioner thought that the boy had come to meet the victim.\n\n The petitioner assaulted and raped the victim. He also\n\n threatened the victim. She remained silent. However, the\n\n petitioner started defaming her in the locality and started saying\n\n that he would again rape her. Hence, the victim made a report to\n\n the police. The police registered the FIR and arrested the\n\n petitioner. The petitioner is innocent and he was falsely\n\n implicated. The prosecution story is highly improbable. The\n\n petitioner had only asked the victim about the person with\n\n whom she was talking in the middle of the night. The person ran\n\n away and the victim falsely implicated the present petitioner.\n\n The victim made a false complaint after four days to save\n\n herself. The victim is married and was unable to explain why she\n\n was found with a stranger at midnight. The investigation is\n\n complete and no recovery is to be effected from the petitioner.\n\n The petitioner is a permanent resident of District Kangra, HP\n\n and there is no likelihood of his absconding.

The petition is opposed by filing a status report\n\n asserting that the victim made a complaint to the police stating\n\n .\n\n that a quarrel had taken place in front of her house on\n\n 18.05.2024 at 12:00 am. The victim came out of the house. One\n\n boy ran towards her home. The petitioner Lucky Kumar also\n\n came to her home. He gave beatings to her because he thought\n\n that the boy had visited her house to meet her. The petitioner\n\n raped the victim and threatened to kill her in case the incident\n\n was revealed to any person. However, the petitioner was\n\n defaming her and threatening to rape her. The police registered\n\n the FIR and arrested the petitioner. The victim and the\n\n petitioner were medically examined and samples were\n\n preserved. As per the investigation, the victim and petitioner\n\n belong to the same village. The petitioner got recovered the stick\n\n with which he had beaten the victim. The result of the analysis is\n\n awaited. The petitioner has been in custody since 22.05.2024.\n\n 3. I have heard Mr. Vijender Katoch, learned counsel for\n\n the petitioner and Ms. Ayushi Negi, learned Deputy Advocate\n\n General, for the respondent-State.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 4\n\n 4. Mr Vijender Katoch, learned counsel for the\n\n petitioner submitted that the prosecution version is highly\n\n .\n\n improbable. The incident had occurred in the middle of the night\n\n when a quarrel has taken place. It is unlikely that the petitioner\n\n could have raped the victim when the noise could have attracted\n\n the villagers. The victim would have shouted for help and\n\n gathered the people. The whole story is false and was made to\n\n divert attention from the fact that the victim was seen with the\n\n stranger at her home in the middle of the night. Therefore, he\n\n prayed that the present petition be allowed and the petitioner be\n\n released on bail.\n\n 5. Ms. Ayushi Negi, learned Deputy Advocate General\n\n for the respondent-State submitted that the petitioner had\n\n raped the victim by entering into her house in the middle of the\n\n night. Such conduct cannot be lightly condoned. The petitioner\n\n trespassed in the house of the victim and raped her. She\n\n submitted that the offence is heinous and the petitioner should\n\n not be released on bail.\n\n 6. I have given considerable thought to the submissions\n\n at the bar and have gone through the records carefully.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 5\n\n \n7. The parameters for granting bail were considered by\n\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nBhagwan Singh v. Dilip Kumar\n @\n\n .\n\n Deepu @ Depak, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1059, wherein it was\n\n observed as under:-\n\n \"12. The grant of bail is a discretionary relief which nec-\n essarily means that such discretion would have to be ex-\n ercised in a judicious manner and not as a matter of\n\n course. The grant of bail is dependent upon contextual\n facts of the matter being dealt with by the Court and may\n vary from case to case. There cannot be any exhaustive\n parameters set out for considering the application for a\n\n grant of bail. However, it can be noted that;\n\n (a) While granting bail the court has to keep in\n mind factors such as the nature of accusations,\n severity of the punishment, if the accusations entail\n a conviction and the nature of evidence in support\n\n of the accusations;\n\n (b) reasonable apprehensions of the witnesses be-\n\n ing tampered with or the apprehension of there be-\n ing a threat for the complainant should also weigh\n\n with the Court in the matter of grant of bail.\n\n (c) While it is not accepted to have the entire evi-\n dence establishing the guilt of the accused beyond\n\n reasonable doubt but there ought to be always a\n prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of\n the charge.\n\n (d) Frivolity of prosecution should always be con-\n sidered and it is only the element of genuineness\n that shall have to be considered in the matter of\n grant of bail and in the event of there being some\n doubt as to the genuineness of the prosecution, in\n the normal course of events, the accused is entitled\n to have an order of bail.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 6\n\n \n13. We may also profitably refer to a decision of this Court\n in \nKalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan @ Pappu Ya-\n\n dav (2004) 7 SCC 528 where the parameters to be taken\n\n .\n\n into consideration for the grant of bail by the Courts have\n\n been explained in the following words:\n\n \"11. The law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is\n very well settled. The court granting bail should ex-\n\n ercise its discretion in a judicious manner and not\n as a matter of course. Though at the stage of grant-\n ing bail a detailed examination of evidence and\n elaborate documentation of the merit of the case\n\n need not be undertaken, there is a need to indicate\n in such orders reasons for prima facie concluding\n why bail was being granted particularly where the\n accused is charged of having committed a serious\n\n offence. Any order devoid of such reasons would\n\n suffer from non-application of mind. It is also nec-\n essary for the court granting bail to consider among\n other circumstances, the following factors also be-\n fore granting bail; they are:\n\n (a) The nature of accusation and the severity of\n punishment in case of conviction and the nature of\n\n supporting evidence.\n\n (b) Reasonable apprehension of tampering with the\n\n witness or apprehension of threat to the com-\n\n plainant.\n\n \n(c) Prima facie satisfaction of the court in support\n of the charge. (See Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudar-\n shan Singh [(2002) 3 SCC 598: 2002 \nSCC (Cri) 688]\n and Puran v. Rambilas\n [(2001) 6 SCC 338: 2001 SCC\n (Cri) 1124].)\"\n\n \n8. A similar view was taken in \nState of Haryana vs\n\n Dharamraj\n 2023 SCC Online 1085, wherein it was observed:\n\n \n7. A foray, albeit brief, into relevant precedents is\n warranted. This Court considered the factors to guide the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 7\n\n grant of bail in \nRam Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan\n Singh\n, (\n2002) 3 SCC 598 and Kalyan Chandra\n Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan\n, (2004) 7 SCC 528. In Prasanta\n\n .\n\n \nKumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee\n, (2010) 14 SCC 496, the\n\n relevant principles were restated thus:\n\n \n'9. ... It is trite that this Court does not, normally, interfere\n with an order passed by the High Court granting or\n\n rejecting bail to the accused. However, it is equally\n incumbent upon the High Court to exercise its discretion\n judiciously, cautiously and strictly in compliance with the\n basic principles \nlaid down in\n a plethora of decisions of\n\n this Court on the point. It is well settled that, among other\n circumstances, the factors to be borne in mind while\n considering an application for bail are:\n\n r (i) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable\n\n ground to believe that the accused had committed\n the offence;\n\n (ii) nature and gravity of the accusation;\n\n (iii) severity of the punishment in the event of\n conviction;\n\n (iv) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing if\n\n released on bail;\n\n (v) character, behaviour, means, position and\n standing of the accused;\n\n (vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated;\n\n (vii) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses\n being influenced; and\n\n (viii) danger, of course, of justice being\n thwarted by grant of bail.'\n\n 9. The contents of the FIR show that a quarrel was\n\n taking place outside the home of the victim at 12:00 am on\n\n 18.05.2024 when one person ran towards the house of the victim.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 8\n\n The petitioner followed him. The petitioner gave beatings to the\n\n victim and also raped her. The victim reported the matter to the\n\n .\n\n police on 22.05.2024 after four days of the incident. She\n\n explained the delay by saying that the petitioner was defaming\n\n her and threatening her to rape her. These averments show that\n\n the complete truth is not being disclosed. There is a force in the\n\n submission of learned counsel for the petitioner that prima facie\n\n the petitioner could not have raped the victim when a quarrel\n\n had taken place and any cry would have attracted the people.\n\n Further, the petitioner was following the person and would be\n\n more concerned about preventing the person's escape. Prima\n\n facie it appears that the prosecution is not telling the complete\n\n truth and it is difficult to believe the prosecution's version.\n\n 10. The petitioner has been in custody since 22.05.2024.\n\n The status report does not show that the presence of the\n\n petitioner is required for any purpose. The petitioner has been\n\n sent to judicial custody, which means that his custodial\n\n interrogation is not required. The status report further shows\n\n that the result of the analysis is still awaited. Some time will be\n\n consumed in preparing the challan after the receipt of the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 9\n\n report. The petitioner cannot be kept inside the jail indefinitely\n\n awaiting his trial.\n\n .\n\n 11. The petitioner stated that he is a permanent resident\n\n of District Kangra, HP, which is not denied in the status report.\n\n Thus, there is no chance of the petitioner's absconding and not\n\n facing the trial.\n\n 12.\n\n It was submitted that the petitioner and the victim\n\n belong to the same village and the petitioner can intimidate the\n\n victim. The bail cannot be denied on this ground alone. Suffice it\n\n to say that the police would have the right to approach the Court,\n\n in case the petitioner violates the conditions of bail.\n\n 13. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the present\n\n petition is allowed and the petitioner is ordered to be released on\n\n bail in the sum of ₹1,00,000/- with one surety of the like\n\n amount to the satisfaction of the learned Trial Court. While on\n\n bail, the petitioner will abide by the following terms and\n\n conditions: -\n\n (i) The petitioner will not intimidate the witnesses nor will\n he influence any evidence in any manner whatsoever.\n\n (ii) The petitioner shall attend the trial in case a charge sheet\n is presented against him and will not seek unnecessary\n adjournments.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS\n\n 10\n\n (iii) The petitioner will not leave the present address for a\n continuous period of seven days without furnishing the\n address of intending visit to the SHO, the Police Station\n\n .\n\n concerned and the Trial Court.\n\n (iv) The petitioner will furnish his mobile number, and social\n media contact to the Police and the Court and will abide\n by the summons/notices received from the Police/Court\n\n through SMS/WhatsApp/Social Media Account. In case of\n any change in the mobile number or social media\n accounts, the same will be intimated to the Police/Court\n within five days from the date of the change.\n\n 14.\n\n It is expressly made clear that in case of violation of\n\n any of these conditions, the prosecution will have a right to file a\n\n petition for cancellation of the bail.\n\n 15. The observation made herein before shall remain\n\n confined to the disposal of the petition and will have no bearing,\n\n whatsoever, on the merits of the case.\n\n (Rakesh Kainthla)\n Judge\n 24th July, 2024\n\n (Shamsh Tabrez)\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 24/07/2024 20:31:58 :::CIS",
