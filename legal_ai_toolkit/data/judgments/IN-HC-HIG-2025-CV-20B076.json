Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter-alia submits that in compli-\n\nance of aforementioned orders, the petitioner has surrendered before the trial\n\nCourt and has subsequently been released on regular bail. Further, the petitioner\n\nis now regularly appearing before the learned trial Court. Moreover, learned\n\ncounsel contends that the impugned orders have been passed by the trial Court\n\nwithout following the mandate of\nSection 82(1)\nof Cr.P.C. Lastly, it is argued\n\nthat the FIR (supra) is not maintainable due to the bar imposed by\nSection\n\n195(1)(a)(i)\nof Cr.P.C., which clearly states that a written complaint is to be\n\nfiled, in cases of offences enumerated from Section 172 to\nSection 188\nof IPC\n\n17 of 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 18\n\n(both included), by the concerned public servant before the Court which can\n\ntake cognizance. Since the registration of an FIR is not maintainable in such\n\ncases, the FIR (supra) is liable to be quashed.\nIn support of his arguments, coun-\n\nsel for the petitioner relies upon the judgments passed by this Court in Pardeep\n\nKumar vs. State of Punjab, CRM-M-41656-2023 decided on 23.08.2023;\n\nAshok Madan vs. State of Haryana\n2020(4) R.C.R. (Cri.)\n\n87;\nSonu vs. State of\n\nHaryana\n2021 (1) RCR (Cri.)\n\n319 and the judgment of the Gujarat High Court\n\nin\nGovindbhai Patel Vs. State of Gujarat\n2004 (4) RCR (Criminal) 830.\n\n35. Per contra Learned State counsel supports the orders passed by the\n\nlearned trial Court by contending that the petitioner did not put in appearance\n\nbefore the trial Court intentionally and deliberately and, therefore, having left\n\nwith no other option, proclamation and the subsequent proceedings resulting in\n\nthe registration of the FIR (supra) were initiated to secure her presence.\n\n36. Learned counsel for respondent No. 2 opposes the prayer made in\n\nthe present petitions on the ground that the petitioner blatantly refuses to comply\n\nwith the undertaking given by her before this Court and respondent No. 2 has\n\nalready initiated Contempt of Court proceedings against the petitioner in this\n\nregard. Despite the clear direction that the parties shall make sincere efforts for\n\nan amicable settlement, passed by this Court, no sincere efforts have been made\n\nby the petitioner to arrive at a just and appropriate compromise. This clearly\n\ndemonstrates mala-fide on her part.\n\n37. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record\n\nof the case with their able assistance and with the consent of parties, the matter\n\nis taken up for final disposal.\n\n38.\nSection 174A\nof the IPC was introduced through the Amendment\n\nAct of 2005, and a corresponding amendment was made to Schedule 1 of the\n18 of 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 19\n\nCriminal Procedure Code\n(\nCrPC\n), classifying this provision as a cognizable\n\noffence. However, no corresponding amendment was made to\nSection 195\nof the\n\nCrPC to exclude\nSection 174A\nIPC from its scope. The proposition that\nSection\n\n174A\nIPC is governed by the procedure as laid out in\nSection 195\nCr.P.C. is\n\nfurther supported by the fact that\nSection 174A\nIPC and the corresponding\n\nSection 209 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023, are essentially identical.\n\nHowever, Section 209 has been explicitly removed from the purview of Section\n\n215 of the Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 which mirrors\nSection 195\n\nof CrPC. In its present form, thus,\nSection 195\nof the CrPC clearly encompasses\n\nSection 174A\nIPC, as the legislature in its wisdom this time has specifically\n\nexcluded Section 209 of the Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita from the ambit of Section\n\n215 of the Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. Furthermore, in 2006, an\n\namendment was made to\nSection 195(1)(b)\nof the CrPC, but Section 195(1)(a)(i)\n\nwas left unchanged. Therefore, it is evident that\nSection 195\nof the CrPC applies\n\nto the offence under\nSection 174A\nIPC.\n\n39. As it is conclusive that\nSection 174A\nIPC is governed by Section\n\n195, it would be apposite to emphasize that the drill of\nSection 195\nof the CrPC\n\nis mandatory in nature. This position is supported by the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court's rendered in C. Muniappan & Others. v. State of\n\nTamil Nadu, (2010) 9 SCC 567, wherein the following observations were made:\n\n\"20.\nSection 195(a)(i)\nCriminal Procedure Code bars the court from tak-\ning cognizance of any offence punishable under\nSection 188\nIndian Penal\nCode or abetment or attempt to commit the same, unless, there is a writ-\nten complaint by the public servant concerned for contempt of his lawful\norder. The object of this provision is to provide for a particular procedure\nin a case of contempt of the lawful authority of the public servant.\nThe court lacks competence to take cognizance in certain types of of-\nfences enumerated therein. The legislative intent behind such a provision\n\n19 of 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 20\n\nhas been that an individual should not face criminal prosecution insti-\ntuted upon insufficient grounds by persons actuated by malice, ill-will or\nfrivolity of disposition and to save the time of the criminal courts being\nwasted by endless prosecutions. This provision has been carved out as an\nexception to the general rule contained under Section 190 Criminal Pro-\ncedure Code that any person can set the law in motion by making a com-\nplaint, as it prohibits the court from taking cognizance of certain offences\nuntil and unless a complaint has been made by some particular authority\nor person. Other provisions in the\nCriminal Procedure Code\nlike sections\n196 and 198 do not lay down any rule of procedure, rather, they only cre-\nate a bar that unless some requirements are complied with, the court shall\nnot take cognizance of an offence described in those Sections.\n(vide\nGovind Mehta v. The State of Bihar\n, AIR 1971 Supreme\nCourt 1708;\nPatel Laljibhai Somabhai v. The State of Gujarat\n, AIR\n1971 Supreme Court 1935;\nSurjit Singh & Ors. v. Balbir Singh\n,\n1996(3) RCR (Criminal) 240 : (1996) 3 SCC 533;\nState of Punjab v. Raj\nSingh & Anr.\n, 1998(1) RCR (Criminal) 576 : (1998) 2 SCC 391; K.\nVengadachalam v. K.C. Palanisamy & Ors., (2005) 7 SCC 352;\nand\nIqbal Singh Marwah & Anr. v. Meenakshi Marwah & Anr.\n, 2005(2)\nRCR (Criminal) 178 : 2005(1) Apex Criminal 581 ).\n\n21. The test of whether there is evasion or non-compliance of Sec-\ntion 195\nCriminal Procedure Code\nor not, is whether the facts disclose\nprimarily and essentially an offence for which a complaint of the court or\nof a public servant is required.\nIn\nBasir-ul-Haq & Ors. v. The State of\nWest Bengal\n, AIR 1953 Supreme Court293; and\nDurgacharan Naik &\nOrs. v. State of Orissa\n, AIR 1966 Supreme Court 1775, this Court held\nthat the provisions of this Section cannot be evaded by describing the of-\nfence as one being punishable under some other sections of\nIndian Penal\nCode\n, though in truth and substance, the offence falls in a category men-\ntioned in\nSection 195\nCriminal Procedure Code Thus, cognizance of such\nan offence cannot be taken by mis-describing it or by putting a wrong la-\nbel on it.\n\n22.\nIn\nM.S. Ahlawat v. State of Haryana & Anr.\n, 1999(4) RCR (Crim-\ninal) 718 , this Court considered the matter at length and held as under :\n\n\"....Provisions of\nSection 195\nCriminal Procedure Code are man-\ndatory and no court has jurisdiction to take cognizance of any of\nthe offences mentioned therein unless there is a complaint in writ-\ning as required under that section.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n23.\nIn\nSachida Nand Singh & Anr. v. State of Bihar & Anr.\n, 1998(1)\nRCR (Criminal) 823 : (1998) 2 SCC 493, this Court while dealing with\nthis issue observed as under :\n\n20 of 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 21\n\n\"7. ..Section 190 of the Code empowers \"any magistrate of the first\nclass\" to take cognizance of \"any offence\" upon receiving a com-\nplaint, or police report or information or upon his own knowledge.\nSection 195 restricts such general powers of the magistrate, and\nthe general right of a person to move the court with a complaint to\nthat extent curtailed. It is a well- recognised canon of interpreta-\ntion that provision curbing the general jurisdiction of\nthe court must normally receive strict interpretation unless the stat-\nute or the context requires otherwise.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n24.\nIn\nDaulat Ram v. State of Punjab\n, AIR 1962 Supreme Court 1206,\nthis Court considered the nature of the provisions of\nSection 195\nCriminal\nProcedure Code In the said case, cognizance had been taken on the police\nreport by the Magistrate and the appellant therein had been tried and\nconvicted, though the concerned public servant, the Tahsildar had not\nfiled any complaint. This Court held as under :\n\n\"The cognizance of the case was therefore wrongly assumed by\nthe court without the complaint in writing of the public servant,\nnamely, the Tahsildar in this case. The trial was thus without juris-\ndiction ab initio and the conviction cannot be maintained. The ap-\npeal is, therefore, allowed and the conviction of the appellant and\nthe sentence passed on him are set aside.\"\n\n(Emphasis added)\n\n25. Thus, in view of the above, the law can be summarised to the effect\nthat there must be a complaint by the public servant whose lawful order\nhas not been complied with. The complaint must be in writing. The provi-\nsions of\nSection 195\nCriminal Procedure Code are mandatory. Non-com-\npliance of it would vitiate the prosecution and all other consequential or-\nders. The Court cannot assume the cognizance of the case without such\ncomplaint. In the absence of such a complaint, the trial and conviction\nwill be void ab initio being without jurisdiction.\"\n\n40.\nSection 195(1)(a)(i)\nof the CrPC specifies that no court shall take\n\ncognizance of any offence punishable under\nSections 172\nto\nof the IPC un-\n\nless a written complaint is made by the concerned public servant or another pub-\n\nlic servant to whom they are administratively subordinate. This provision serves\n\nas an explicit bar, stating that the court cannot take cognizance of a matter based\n\non a Final Report under\nSection 173\nof Cr.P.C. A complaint, as defined under\n\nSection 2(d)\nof the CrPC, excludes a Police Report or Final Report. Thus, cog-\n\n21 of 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 22\n\nnizance can only be taken on a written complaint filed in Court under\nSection\nof the CrPC. Further,\nSection 21(3)\nof the IPC defines \"public servant\" to\n\ninclude every judge or any person empowered by law to perform adjudicatory\n\nfunctions, either individually or as part of a body. As a result, from the plain lan-\n\nguage of\nSection 195\nof the CrPC, it is clear that criminal prosecution under\n\nSections 172\nto\nof the IPC can only be initiated through a written complaint\n\nfiled by the concerned public servant or another public servant to whom they are\n\nadministratively subordinate. (See:\nPardeep Kumar vs. State of Punjab and\n\nAnother\n(supra); Jarnail Singh @ Rana vs. State of Punjab, CRM-M-48718-\n\n2019 decided on 17.04.2024 and Charanjit Singh @ Channi CRM-M-453-\n\n2023 pronounced on 06.12.2023)\n\n41. In the present case, the learned Magistrate, being a public servant as\n\ndefined under\nSection 21\nof the IPC, was required to follow the procedure pre-\n\nscribed by law if he intended to initiate proceedings against the petitioner for the\n\noffence under\nSection 174A\nof the IPC. The proper course of action would have\n\nbeen to file a written complaint before the competent jurisdictional court. How-\n\never, instead of adhering to this legal requirement, the learned Magistrate merely\n\nforwarded a copy of its orders to the local police, directing them to initiate pro-\n\nceedings under\nSection 174A\nIPC, which effectively led to the registration of the\n\nimpugned FIR. Given the mandatory nature and scope of\nSection 195\nof the\n\nCrPC, such an approach is in clear violation of its provisions. Consequently,\n\nboth the order passed by the Magistrate directing the initiation of proceedings\n\nand the resulting FIR stand contrary to the procedural safeguards enshrined in\n\nSection 195\nof Cr.P.C.\n\n22 of 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 23\n\n42. While the scheme of criminal justice system necessitates curtail-\n\nment of personal liberty to some extent, it is of the utmost importance that the\n\nsame is done in line with the procedure established by law to maintain a healthy\n\nbalance between personal liberty of the individual-accused and interests of the\n\nsociety in promoting law and order. Such procedure must be compatible with\n\nArticle 21\nof the Constitution of India i.e. it must be fair, just and not suffer from\n\nthe vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness. Additionally, it is a settled law that\n\nwhere a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way, the thing must be\n\ndone in that way or not at all. Other methods are necessarily forbidden. Refer-\n\nence can be made to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Dharani Sug-\n\nars and\nChemicals Ltd. v. Union of India\nreported in (2019) 5 SCC 480.\n\n43. In the eventuality of her non-appearance, the presence of the\n\naccused first ought to have been secured by issuing summons or bailable war-\n\nrants, and non-bailable warrants or proclamation should not generally be issued\n\nat the first instance. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the trial Court\n\nhas issued a proclamation straight away, without recording any reasons to indic-\n\nate that the petitioner has absconded or is concealing herself from the process of\n\nlaw. Conspicuously, no summons or bailable warrants were issued prior to issu-\n\nance of the proclamation. This Court in the judgment passed in\nMajor Singh @\n\nMajor Vs. State of Punjab\n2023 (3) RCR (Criminal) 406; 2023 (2) Law Herald\n\n1506 has held that the Court is first required to record its satisfaction before is-\n\nsuance of process under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. and non-recording of the satisfaction\n\nitself makes such order suffering from incurable illegality. Furthermore, the\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner has taken a specific stand that the petitioner\n\nwas declared to be a proclaimed person without following the drill of\nSection 82\nof 24\n\n::: Downloaded on - 04-02-2025 22:15:53 :::\n\nNeutral Citation No:=2025:PHHC:013581\n\nCRM-M-8611-2022 (O&M) and 29 other cases 24\n\nCr.P.C\n. Since the proclamation was never served on the petitioner, all actions\n\ntaken post non-execution of the proclamation stand vitiated.\n\n44. In view of the above discussion, the present petitions are allowed\n\nand the impugned order(s) dated 02.07.2018, 19.02.2018, 19.04.2019,\n\n26.08.2019, 16.03.2018 vide which, the petitioner was declared as proclaimed\n\nperson as well as FIR Nos. 429, 408, 428, 416, 425, 426, 413, 421, 410, 423,\n\n419, 417, 424, 411, 415, 427, 414, 420, 422, 412, 418 and 407 dated 26.03.2019,\n\nFIR Nos. 404, 405 dated 25.03.2019, FIR No. 925, 926, 927 dated 22.05.2019,\n\nFIR No. 1851 dated 18.09.2019, FIR No. 452 dated 29.03.2019, FIR No. 187\n\ndated 13.02.2019 under\nSection 174-A\nof Indian Penal Code registered at Police\n\nStation Shivaji Nagar, Gurugram (Haryana) and all the subsequent proceedings\n\narising therefrom are hereby quashed qua the petitioner.\n\n45.
