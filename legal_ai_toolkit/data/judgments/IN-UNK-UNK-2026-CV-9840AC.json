TEJI\n JUDGMENT\n\nGITA MITTAL, J\n\n1. The appellants before us assail the judgment dated 16 th\nDecember, 2013 passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing\nW.P.(C) No. 7929/2013 rejecting the appellant's prayer for the\nrelief of quashing of the general selection process for appointment\nto the post of Junior Assistants to the respondent no.1 pursuant to\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 1 of 49\n\n their advertisement Advt. No.Estab.IV/246/2013 dated 6 th\nNovember, 2013.\n\n2. The Delhi University Contract Employees Union had filed\nthe writ petition contending that it was a Union of more than 200\nemployees, all citizens of India, who were working on contract\nbasis in the post of Junior Assistant with the University of Delhi\nfor the last several years and appointed between 1998 to 2013.\nMembers of the petitioner union includes persons belonging to the\nunreserved category i.e. general category, as well as persons\nbelonging to the reserved category of scheduled castes, scheduled\ntribes and those from the other backward classes.\n\n3. The petitioner nos. 2 and 3 namely Sh. Vishal Joseph and\nSh. Rakesh Sharma are two such members of the petitioner no.1\nwho have been so appointed as Junior Assistants and working in all\ndepartments and faculties of the University of Delhi.\n\n4. The appellants have contended that unlike the appointment\nof civil servants and employees in the Government of India where\nPublic Service Commission undertakes the entire exercise of\nselection and recommending appointment of employees, so far as\nthe Delhi University is concerned, all necessary actions including\nthe selection process is undertaken internally by the University\nwithout the intervention of any external agency.\n\n5. The petitioner no.2 - Vishal Joseph, a citizen of India, holds\na Masters Degree in Library Information Science who was\nappointed in April, 2003 as a Junior Assistant in the Department of\nModern Indian Languages and Literary Studies after a written test;\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 2 of 49\n\n a skill test in the nature of a computer test as well as an interview.\nHe continues to work on contract basis in this very department\neven on the date of filing of the writ petition in December, 2013.\n\n6. The petitioner no. 3 Rakesh Sharma, also a citizen of India,\nholds the degree of Master of Education who was appointed in\nOctober, 2002 on contract basis as a Junior Assistant in the\nDepartment of Physics and Astro-Physics after passing the written\ntest and interview which position he continues to hold till the date\nof filing of the writ petition.\n\n7. The University of Delhi was established and incorporated\nunder the provisions of the \nDelhi University Act, 1922\n and is\nrequired to function strictly in accordance with the provisions\nthereof as well as in compliance with the Statutes, Ordinances and\nRegulations framed in exercise of power conferred by the statutory\nprovisions.\n\n8. For discharge of the various functions in the University of\nDelhi, amongst others, 714 sanctioned posts of Junior Assistant\ncum Typist(Assistant); Caretakers and Stenographers which form\npart of Group-C stand created. In as much as the present case is\nconcerned with appointment to the post of Junior Assistant, we\nshall confine our consideration to these posts only.\n\n9. The appellants have asserted that out of the total of 714\nposts, 512 have been lying vacant for the last several years and\nwere not being filled up on regular basis for the last 12 to 15 years\nprior to the filing of the writ petition in December, 2013. Out of\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 3 of 49\n\n the total posts in Group C, 301 posts belonged to Junior Assistant\nout of which 255 posts were lying vacant.\n\n To substantiate this submission, our attention is drawn to an\noffice order being Ref. No. Estab II(i)/2012/09 dated 25th July,\n2013 whereby over 400 persons have been appointed as Junior\nAssistant on contract basis at a fixed remuneration of `13200/- per\nmonth with effect from 2nd July, 2013 till 31st December, 2013\nagainst all vacant posts.\n\n10. The members of the appellant no.1 were appointed on fixed\ntenure of six months at a time; their services terminated notionally\nfor a cosmetic one day break to create the facade of the termination\nof the appointment immediately followed by fresh appointment\nletter issued for six months. This practice has been continuing for\na period of over two decades.\n\n11. Many members of the petitioner Union, were initially\nappointed on ad-hoc basis after written test and interview and were\nbeing paid full salaries and allowances payable to a newly re-\nappointed junior assistant. These very persons were subsequently\nappointed on contract basis for a fixed 'fee'. In this regard, the\nappellants have placed before us copies of letters dated 3/4th\nSeptember, 2002 and 17th January, 2006.\n\n12. It is an admitted position before us that the persons so\nappointed are holding the same qualification, if not better, than\npersons holding permanent posts of Junior Assistant. They are also\nperforming the same functions.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 4 of 49\n\n 13. It is also undisputed that all these persons have rendered\nsatisfactory service.\n\n14. The writ petition was filed for the reason that without\nframing any Scheme for making the appointments of the members\nof the appellant no.1 permanent, the respondent no.1 continued to\nappoint them on contract basis for a limited period of time at a\nmeagre fixed 'fees'. Despite this violation of the rights of the\nappellants and its members, the respondent no.1 initially put up an\nadvertisement dated 30th May, 2013 inviting applications for\nappointment of 60 persons as Junior Assistant on contract basis\npursuant whereby the University selected 195 applicants for a skill\ntest which was held on 26th October, 2013. Without announcing\nthe final result, the respondent no.1 issued a fresh advertisement\ndated 6th November, 2013 inviting applications to 255 posts of\nJunior Assistant. The appellants have pointed out that the essential\nqualifications as well as the mode of selection was identical to the\nmanner in which they were appointed and thus apprehended\ntermination of their services in a clandestine manner on the basis of\na clause in the appointment letter which enables the respondent\nno.1 to terminate their services \"anytime even earlier without\nnotice or assigning any reason\" leading to the filing of the writ\npetition.\n\n15. The notice inviting applications to the post of Junior\nAssistant dated 30th May, 2013 was followed by the notice\ninforming the holding of the written examination communicating\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 5 of 49\n\n the syllabus dated 6th August, 2013; notice communicating the\nexamination centres dated 19th August, 2013; and notice dated 17th\nOctober, 2013 communicating the date and time of the skill test\nwhich were issued by the University of Delhi.\n\n16. The learned Single Judge has dismissed the writ petition\nbearing W.P(C)No.7929/2013 vide impugned judgment dated 16th\nDecember, 2013 wherein it has been considered that \"...Petitioners\nalso seek relief of their being regularized to their posts which they\nare holding, and which posts are contractual posts\". To\nsubstantiate the dismissal, the learned Single Judge has placed\nreliance on (2001) 4 SCC 1, Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Uma\nDevi to hold \"that Courts should desist from issuing orders\npreventing regular selection or recruitment at the instance of\npersons who are only adhoc/contractual/casual employees and\nwho have not secured regular appointments as per procedure\nestablished\". Dismissing the writ, the learned Single Judge finally\nheld in the impugned judgment that no relief, as was being prayed\nfor by the petitioners, could have been granted.\n\n17. We find that the learned Single Judge has considered the\ncase from the perspective of only as if the appellants had sought a\nprayer for regularisation of their services. The rejection of the writ\npetition was primarily premised on the ratio of the pronouncement\nof the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court reported at (2006)\n4 SCC 1 Secretary, State of Karnataka & Ors. v. Uma Devi &\nOrs.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 6 of 49\n\n 18. The judgment of the Single Judge has been impugned inter\nalia on the ground that the learned Single Judge has erred in\ntreating the writ petition as one seeking regularisation and that the\nprayers made in the writ petition have not been considered and that,\ngiven the action and order of the University of Delhi, the writ\npetition could not have been dismissed.\n\n We examine the challenge laid by the appellants hereafter.\n\nWhat was sought by way of WP (C) No.7929/2013 by the\nappellants?\n\n19. Given the basis for the impugned judgment, we may firstly\nconsider the prayer clause in the writ petition which was before the\nlearned Single Judge. We extract hereunder the prayer clause in\nthe writ petition which reads thus:\n\n \"(i) To direct the Respondents to formulate a\n scheme for regularising the services of members of\n the petitioner Union and other petitioners working\n on contract/ad hoc/daily wage basis after relaxing\n age requirement so as to confer on them permanent\n status;\n\n (ii) To direct Respondent no. 1 to pay salary to all\n the members of the petitioner Union and other\n petitioners at the rate of the minimum salary of the\n grade to which they have been appointed as is done\n by Respondent No. 1 in respect of Assistant\n Professors of the University/Colleges;\n\n (iii) To direct Respondent No. 1 to pay to all\n the members of the petitioner Union and other\n petitioners who have worked for six months or 240\n days in each year of their employment with\n Respondent No. 1 on ad hoc/contract/daily wage\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 7 of 49\n\n basis non-productivity linked bonus retrospectively\n from the date(s) of their employment;\n\n (iv) To direct Respondent No. 1 to fill up all\n vacancies in future as and when they arise within six\n months of occurrence to avoid any ad\n hoc/contractual arrangement in future;\n\n (v) To direct Respondent No. 1 to grant maternity\n leave and other benefits to women employees;\n To allow this writ petition with costs; and\n\n (vi) To pass any other appropriate order\n and/or direction which this Hon'ble court deems fit\n and proper in the interest of justice.\"\n\n It is apparent from the above that the writ petition did not\nseek regularisation in terms but sought a direction to the\nrespondents to formulation of a scheme for the purpose. Counsels\nwould submit that this is in terms of the decision in Uma Devi. We\nshall consider this submission a little later in this judgment. But\nbefore, some essential facts.\n\nRecruitment rules, Appointment of appellants\n\n20. In order to take a view in the matter, it is necessary to\nundertake an examination as to the prescribed qualification for the\npost in question.\n\n21. We first examine the qualification prescription for the post\nof \"Junior Assistant\" with which this case is concerned. The\nUniversity of Delhi have placed on record the Recruitment Rules\n(Non-teaching) which were in vogue prior to 2008. So far as the\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 8 of 49\n\n posts of \"Junior Assistant\" is concerned, the following\nqualifications are prescribed :-\n\n \"Designation : Junior Assistant (English)\n &\n Scale of Pay : Rs.3050-75-3950-804590\n Qualifications: X Pass in Sr. Secondary School (10+2).\n\n However, for Internal Candidates, the\n qualifications will remain as\n matriculation provided they have 5 years\n experience.\"\n\n22. So far as direct recruitment is concerned, the following\nprocedure for recruitment has been notified :\n\n \"Procedure :(a) Conducting of Preliminary Test consisting\n of:\n\n (i) General Intelligence 50 Marks\n (ii) General Awareness 50 Marks\n (iii) General English 50 Marks\n (iv) Numerical Ability 50 Marks\n\n Passing Marks in the PRELIMINARY TEST\n are:\n\n a) External candidates (General category) 45%\n in each component & 55% in aggregate.\n\n b) External candidate (reserve category) -\n 40% in each component & 50% in aggregate.\n\n c) Internal candidates (General category) -\n\n 40% in each component & 50% in aggregate.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 9 of 49\n\n d) Internal Candidates (Reserve category) -\n 35% in each component & 45% in aggregate.\n\n (B) Those who qualify the said preliminary test\n will have to appear in the following tests: (No.\n of candidates called restricted to TEN TIMES\n the No. of vacancies).\n\n i) Written Essay Test in English of 100 Marks\n & of one hour duration.\n\n ii) Aptitude Test to be determined by the\n University at present it will consist of Typing\n Test @ 30 w.p.m.\n\n iii) There will be no interview.\n\n iv) The Panel as drawn on the basis of the\n performance in these tests, i.e., Aptitude Test &\n Essay Test.\n\n The panel so drawn will continue to be\n operational for two years.\n\n Promotion from Junior Assistant to Assistant\n under 25% promotional Quota:\n\n The Committee has laid down the following\n procedure:\n\n 25% of the available vacancies will be filled up\n on the basis of the \"FAST TRACK\" method.\n Those who have completed three years of\n service will be eligible to take the test. They\n will be tested in the following:\n\n i) Knowledge in Computer Operating (word\n processing, data analysis, packages).\n\n ii) English\n\n iii) Drafting & Noting\n\nLPA 989/2013 Page 10 of 49\n\n iv) Knowledge of University Rules.\n\n Hence again, the total marks will be 200, i.e.,\n 50 marks for each component mentioned above.\n The minimum qualifying marks will be 40%. As\n soon as the number of posts are filled on the\n basis of available vacancies from the Panel, the\n panel will get lapsed automatically. The test\n will be held every year / once in two years\n depending on the number of vacancies in any\n year; in case there is no vacancy in particular\n year, no test will be held.\n\n (E.C. Reso. No.183 dated 13.11.1998)\n Mode of recruitment: 50% of the posts to be\n filled in by open Advt. or the candidates\n sponsored by the Staff Selection Commission\n and remaining 50% by promotion from Group\n 'D' category Departmental candidates.\"\n\n The University was thus effecting appointment to 25% of the\navailable vacancies on the basis of what was termed as the \"FAST\nTRACK\" method from those who had completed three years of\nservice and undertook a special test to be held either each year or\nonce in two years depending on the number of vacancies in terms\nof the Executive Council Resolution No. 183 dated 13th November,\n1998.\n\n23. It is noteworthy that the above recruitment rules contained\nno stipulation of any age limit. The University of Delhi also\nnotified online applications for the said positions and posts.\n\n24. The petitioners were appointed between the period from\n1993 to 2003 when these recruitment rules were in vogue. It is\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 11 of 49\n\n admitted by the University of Delhi before us that the appellants\nwho were appointed on ad-hoc basis or on contract basis possessed\nthe requisite qualifications.\n\n25. These Recruitment Rules came to be amended in the year\n2008 for the 288 posts of Junior Assistant. So far as the\neducational and other qualification were concerned, it was\nprescribed as follows :\n\n7. Educational and other Essential: #\nqualification required for\ndirect recruitment. 1. A Senior Secondary School\n Certificate (+2) or its equivalent\n qualification from a recognized\n Board / University / Institution with\n at least 50% marks or a Graduate\n from a recognized University.\n\n 2. Having a typing speed of 40\n w.p.m. in English or 30 w.p.m. in\n Hindi Typewriting through\n computers.\n\n Desirable:\n\n 1. Degree/Diploma in Computer\n Applications / Science and\n knowledge of operation of latest\n packages relating to Pay roll,\n Accounts, MIS etc.\n\n 2. Diploma in Office Management\n and Secretarial Practice.\n\n # Based on the requirement of posts,\n the University shall conduct its own\n recruitment test or alternatively seek\n nomination from the Staff Selection\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 12 of 49\n\n Commission for each recruitment\n year. In case the University seeks\n nomination from SSC, the same\n qualification for similar posts\n prescribed by the Govt. of India\n shall apply.\n\n Note:\n\n 1. The incumbent is expected to\n work under the close supervision of\n Section Officer or Assistant\n Registrar / Assistant Controller of\n Examinations. He should possess\n an aptitude for drafting/noting in\n English, office procedure. Data\n processing in a computerized\n environment and is expected to\n provide support services in one or\n more functions related to\n Educational Administration/\n Examinations/General\n Administration/ House Keeping /\n Establishment/HR/ Legal\n /Purchase/Accounts & Finance/\n Project management / Public\n Relations.\n\n 2. All the candidates for direct\n recruitment will be required to\n appear in a written test to adjudge\n their ability of expression and\n knowledge relating to their work.\n\n The selection being based on the\n performance of the candidates in\n written test and interview.\n\n 3. The scheme of the examination\n including weightage of marks for\n\nLPA 989/2013 Page 13 of 49\n\n written test and interview etc., as\n prescribed by the University from\n time to time with the approval of the\n Executive Council in this regard.\n\n It is to be noted that so far as appointment from persons\nwithin the organisation is concerned, the recruitment rules\nprescribed merely a matriculation and 5 years experience. These\nrules also prescribed appointment of 25% through a limited\ndepartmental competitive examination.\n\n26. It was also notified that the University \"shall conduct its own\nrecruitment test or alternatively seek nomination from the Staff\nSelection Commission for each recruitment year\".\n\n27. These recruitment rules prescribed the age limit for direct\nrecruitment as 27 years. 75% of the appointment to the post were\nto be filled by direct recruitment while 25% by a limited\ndepartmental examination from Matriculate Group-D employees\nworking in the University with a limited period of 5 years regular\nservice.\n\n This is so far as the essential qualifications are concerned.\n\nNumber of posts and vacancy position\n\n28. It is essential also to examine as to whether vacancies to\nregular posts were available when the appellants were appointed.\nIt appears that the University of Delhi had made a proposal on 1 st\nOctober, 2009 informing the University Grants Commission\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 14 of 49\n\n (\"UGC\") of the requirement of the capacity, advancement and\nadditional requirement of non-teaching posts to provide OBC\nreservation as per the \nCentral Educational Institutions (Reservation\n& Admission) Act, 2006\n. By a letter dated 12th January, 2011, the\nUGC granted approval for creation of additional 530 non-teaching\nposts. Out of these, 343 were against vacant positions out of which\n2 were required to be filled up on outsource basis and 187\nadditional posts out of which 29 positions would be engaged on\noutsource basis. These posts included the non-teaching strength at\nall levels which included 237 and 13 posts of Junior Assistants.\nThus, 187 additional posts had been permitted to be created.\n\n The recruitment to the additional posts created is implicit in\ntheir very creation.\n\n29. There is no dispute at all before us that as on the date when\nthe appellant nos. 2 and 3 as well as the members of the appellant\nno.1 were appointed, vacant regular posts of Junior Assistants were\navailable with the respondents.\n\nChallenge to manner of appointment of the appellant nos. 2 & 3\nand members of the appellant no.1\n\n30. The respondent no.1 has submitted that the appointments on\ncontract basis were made from time to time either on the basis of\nlimited advertisements such as those displayed on the department's\nnotice boards or even without issuance of any advertisement at all.\nIt is at the same time also admitted that on some occasions,\nadvertisements were put up on the University website. It has been\nsubmitted that as per recruitment rules, direct recruitment/open\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 15 of 49\n\n selection shall be made only after making an open advertisement in\nleading newspapers and employment news at serial no. 6(v) of the\nmode of recruitment.\n\n31. We find that again, sweeping assertions have been made\nwithout pointing out which of the appointments were so made.\nInherent in the \"some\" is the admission that appointments were\nmade after following open advertisement. On the contrary, the\nappellants have urged that all appointments were made after\nissuance of notices.\n\n32. The record of the case bears out that the members of the\nappellant no. 1 and the private appellants had applied to the\nUniversity of Delhi pursuant to notices inviting applications for the\ncontractual employment or ad-hoc employment. The mode of\ninviting applications by pasting on notice boards or by newspapers\nwas a matter which had been decided by the University of Delhi at\nthe relevant stage.\n\n33. In the instant case, the University of Delhi was offering\nappointment, albeit of fixed tenure. This appointment was being\noffered by the University of Delhi after advertisement and after the\nperson concerned had undertaken the selection process conducted\nby the employer. The candidates also possess the qualifications as\nnotified by the recruitment rules. It is also cannot be held, nor is it\ncontended that the present case is a case where back door\nappointments were made without any advertisement and without\nany kind of selection process. The respondents do not say so.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 16 of 49\n\n 34. The respondent no.1 is so hopelessly placed that it has made\nbald assertions without supporting record. The University is\nunable to inform us as to appointment of which of the petitioners\nwere effected after putting of the advertisement on the University\nwebsite and the employees being selected from the open selection\nprocess, and which were not.\n\n35. The appellants have placed on record the notices as a sample\ncopy dated 17th November, 2012 whereby the University of Delhi\ncalled applications for appointment to the post of Junior Assistant\non contract basis for a period of six months on a consolidated pay-\nscale. In these notices, the required essential qualifications were\nthose as prescribed in the recruitment rules which have been set out\nabove. A communication dated 23rd September, 2005 issued by the\nUniversity of Delhi notifying the candidate about the typing test for\nthe post of Junior Assistant for engagement on contract basis has\nalso been placed on record.\n\n36. Before us, members of the appellant no.1-Union and\nappellant nos. 2 and 3 possessed qualification higher than the\nminimum prescribed; competed with other candidates and\nunderwent the selection process which consisted of a written\nexamination as well as interview.\n\n37. What, therefore, is important i.e. that assignment of posts to\nthe different departments was by the University of Delhi. Further,\nthe notices inviting applications were also issued, not by\nDepartments, but by the University itself. The appointment letters\nto the appellants and others so appointed were issued by the\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 17 of 49\n\n University of Delhi. All salaries stand paid by the University of\nDelhi respondent no.1 alone. The shift from appointment on ad-\nhoc to contract basis as well as the continuation of the appellants\non contract basis was also effected by the University of Delhi. The\nobjection of the University to the appointments of the appellants\npremised on displaying the notices is, therefore, completely\nmisplaced. No aspersions can be cast on the conduct of the\nappellants for such actions of the employer.\n\n38. It is important to note that the mode of entry into service\nwould be relevant if this court was considering a prayer for\nregularisation on behalf of the appellant nos. 2 and 3 and the\nmembers of the appellant no.1. It is not so before us. It is an\nadmitted position that writ courts, and this court sitting in appeal\nover the adjudication by a writ court, would not have power to\nissue a writ of mandamus directing regularisation of service of\ncontract employees or daily wagers. The appellants before us are\npressing for a direction to the respondents only to consider\nformulating a Scheme whereby they could be considered for\nappointment taking into account the years of their experience in the\nlight of their possessing the requisite eligibility qualifications as\nprescribed under the recruitment rules.\n\n39. The further submission is that the contractual appointment of\nthe appellants were made as per the exigency of the situation. It is\nsubmitted that these contractual appointments were for a fixed\ntenure of period on consolidated remuneration.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 18 of 49\n\n 40. In this regard, some employment letters have been placed\nbefore us.\n\n41. One such memorandum of appointment issued by the\nUniversity of Delhi is dated 3/4th September, 2002 and refers to\nappointment \"on ad-hoc basis on Rs.3050/- p.m. plus usual\nallowances in the pay scale of Rs.3050-75-3950-80-4590 for a\nmaximum period of 89 days only\". The letter of appointment stated\nthat the appointee \"will have no claim for regular appointment\".\n\n42. In addition, the appointee was required to depose on an\naffidavit. The draft of the affidavit included the following clause :-\n\n \"5. That I will have no claim with the University of\n Delhi for regularization of service against this or\n any other post.\"\n\n The letter of appointment required the employee to furnish\nthe \"enclosed affidavit on a non-judicial stamp paper\". It is\nsubmitted that all contractual appointees submitted such affidavits.\n\n43. Before us, Mr. Sudhir Nandrajog, learned senior counsel as\nwell as Mr. Santosh Kumar, Advocate on behalf of the University\nof Delhi have staunchly relied on the said stipulation in the letter of\nappointment as well as the above para 5 of the affidavit and\nsubmitted that the appellants are bound by their undertaking and\nhave waived rights, if any, to regularisation.\n\n44. The appointment letter which was issued mandated\nfurnishing the \"enclosed affidavit\". Thus, the person to whom the\nappointment was offered had no choice at all in the matter. The\nrequirement of the affidavit was stipulated as also the format in\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 19 of 49\n\n which the affidavit had to be submitted was also given. None of\nthe appointees had any choice at all in the matter. Where is the\nvoluntary choice of any condition of employment to an employee?\n\n45. It needs no elaborate discussion that so far as employment is\nconcerned, the youth, especially the educated youth as in the\npresent case, without the remotest possibility of a fruitful\nengagement would reach out to any source of livelihood.\n\n46. No difference could be pointed out on behalf of the\nUniversity of Delhi to the process of recruitment which was\nundergone by these contractual recruits from that which is\nundergone by persons to whom regular appointment is offered\nunder the rules. It is writ large on the face of the record that the\nmembers of the appellant no.1 and the appellant nos. 2 and 3 have\nactually undergone a procedure akin to that prescribed under the\nrecruitment rules for regular appointment to the post of Junior\nAssistant, though they have been offered only the contractual\nappointment.\n\n47. The respondents also contest the writ petition for the reason\nthat there is no provision in the recruitment rules for regularization\nof contractual employees. Placing reliance on the pronouncement\nreported at (\n1992) 4 SCC 33, Director, Institute of Management\nDevelopment, U.P. Vs. Pushpa Srivastava\n , it is contended that\nsuch contractual appointment is an appointment which came to an\nend by efflux of time and created no right on the appointee to\ncontinue in the post and to claim regularization.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 20 of 49\n\n 48. We may also set out the ratio of the judgment in Umadevi\ncase (supra) which has been relied upon by the learned Single\nJudge as well and reads thus:-\n\n \"xxx 17. We have already indicated the\n constitutional scheme of public employment in this\n country, and the executive, or for that matter the\n Court, in appropriate cases, would have only the\n right to regularize an appointment made after\n following the due procedure, even though a non-\n fundamental element of that process or procedure\n has not been followed. This right of the executive\n and that of the court, would not extend to the\n executive or the court being in a position to direct\n that an appointment made in clear violation of the\n constitutional scheme, and the statutory rules made\n in that behalf, can be treated as permanent or can be\n directed to be treated as permanent.\"\n\n49. So far as the notification of the tenure on the appointment\nletter is concerned and the respondent's contention that the\nemployees accepted the same, we find that the said stipulation was\nnot treated as sacrosanct by the University of Delhi for the reason\nthat the authorities were aware that the appointment was being\nmade against vacant permanent posts and that there was need for\nthe services of the person concerned. For this reason, technical and\ncosmetic breaks of merely a single day were being given between\nextensions of the same appointment by a further tenure.\n\n50. Such breaks were in vogue and a strategy adopted by\nemployees including the state players and statutory authorities for\ndecades to avoid claims of regularisation. We have a tradition of\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 21 of 49\n\n \"daily wagers\", \"muster roll employees (even \"temporary muster\nroll\" and \"regular muster roll\" as was the practice in the New Delhi\nMunicipal Council), adhoc employment and contractual\nemployment. Several such engagements led to regularisation\norders which have come to an end by the binding and authoritative\nConstitutional Bench pronouncement in \nState of Karnataka v.\nUma Devi\n.\n\n51. The factual matrix is thus in consonance with the law \nlaid\ndown by\n the Apex Court stating that a post must be duly created or\nsanctioned before it can be filled by in accordance with law. (Ref:\n\n(\n2007) 1 SCC 408 Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v\nWorkmen Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\n; (\n2006) 8 SCC\n67 State of M.P. & Ors. v Yogesh Chandra Dubey & Ors.\n)\n\nWhether there was a ban imposed by the University Grants\nCommission for effecting regular appointments\n\n52. Referring to a letter dated 31st August, 1999, issued by the\nUniversity Grants Commission, it has been vehemently contended\non behalf of the University of Delhi that no regular appointment\ncould be made as there was a ban on such recruitment by the\nUniversity Grants Commission. This communication referred to a\nmemorandum issued by the Ministry of Finance requiring the\nimplementation of inter alia the following as an austerity measure:\n\n \"(2) Ban on filling up of vacant posts\n Every University/College shall undertake a review\n of all the posts, which are lying vacant in the\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 22 of 49\n\n Universities and in the affiliated Colleges and\n subordinate offices, etc., in consultation with the\n University Grants Commission. Financial Advisers\n will ensure that the review is completed in a time\n bound manner and full details of vacant posts in\n their respective Universities etc., are available.\n\n TILL THE REVIEW IS COMPLETED, NO\n VACANT POSTS SHALL BE FILLED UP\n EXCEPT WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE\n UNIVERSITY GRANTS COMMISSION.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n53. It has been further submitted that in furtherance of the above,\nby a letter dated 17th November, 2001, the UGC had rejected the\nproposal of the University as contained in an advertisement no. 175\ndated 10th August, 2001 for filling up non-teaching posts without\nthe approval of the UGC.\n\n54. The respondent no.1 has also placed on record a letter dated\n24th December, 2003 from the UGC addressed to the Registrar,\nUniversity of Delhi referring to a ban on the filling up of vacant\nnon-teaching posts and that the matter was being referred to the\nMinistry of HRD for their decision. The respondent no.1 has\nreferred to the UGC diktat that \"till the matter is resolved, vacant\nposts must not be filled up, otherwise the posts filled up by the\nUniversity will be treated as unapproved and the expenditure of\nthese posts will not be borne by the UGC\".\n\n55. \nIn the same regard, the University of Delhi has also placed\nreliance on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at\n(\n2006) 5 SCC 493 National Fertilizers Ltd. & Ors. v. Somvir\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 23 of 49\n\n Singh\n wherein it had been held that if there was a ban against\nregular recruitment, ad-hoc appointees cannot seek regularisation.\n\n56. In the same breath, it has been argued before us with some\nvehemence on behalf of the University of Delhi that if it did not\nmake the appointments on contract basis, the University could not\nhave functioned and the interest of the students and university\nwould have suffered. This submission in fact clearly underlines the\nimperative need of the services of the appellants.\n\n57. There are certain important aspects of the manner in which\nthe respondents have proceeded in the matter so far as the ban\nagainst recruitment is concerned. If the above letters of the UGC\nare to be strictly read, the ban was absolute. It did not say that the\nrespondents could affect recruitment of ad-hoc or contract\nemployees. The communication states that the matter of\nappointment was being examined in the perspective of a \"financial\nausterity measure\".\n\n58. On the contrary, the UGC and the university by their orders\nand actions manifest that the bar was never intended to be worked\nqua the university. Such ban was certainly never implemented or\nworked as the manifested in the present case.\n\n59. We find that instead by the letter dated 12th January, 2011,\nthe University Grants Commission has in fact approved 237\nadditional posts of junior assistants. Therefore, so far as the non-\nteaching posts are concerned, clearly these additional posts were\nobviously approved because the UGC had identified need of the\nDelhi University for so many employees. Where would there be\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 24 of 49\n\n identification and creation of posts unless appointments thereto\ncould be effected? It is to be noted that this letter dated 12th\nJanuary, 2011 does not refer to any ban against recruitment.\n\n60. The ban was as a measure of financial austerity, it would\nprohibit absolute recruitment including temporary or ad hoc or\ncontractual recruitment as well.\n\n61. Pursuant to successful participation in the selection process,\nthe appellants have placed as samples, the copies of the\nappointment letters dated 3/4th September, 2002 and 17th January,\n2006 issued by the University of Delhi. It is undisputed that the\nletters of appointment have not been issued by any department or\nany authority subordinate to the University of Delhi but by the\nDelhi University itself.\n\n62. Also on record is communications dated 13 th May, 2013\nrevising the rates of the consolidated fees paid to the contractual\nemployees. Clearly, even though notified, no such ban was\nimplemented either by the University or enforced by the University\nGrants Commission.\n\n63. Further the University of Delhi has never intimated the\nemployees including the petitioners who were being appointed of\nany ban against their recruitment. It was the University of Delhi\nwhich initiated the process of appointment, issued notifications\ninviting applications, notifying the essential qualifications. The\nUniversity implemented the entire selection process.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 25 of 49\n\n \n64. The pronouncement of the Supreme Court in \nNational\nFertilizer Limited v. Somvir Singh\n therefore, would clearly have\nno application to the facts of the present case.\n\n65. It is also noteworthy that the employees so appointed\nincluding the appellant nos. 2 and 3 and members of the appellant\nno.1 have thus received the payment at which they were appointed\nand upwardly revised. Clearly, the UGC has funded these\npayments by the Delhi University to the appellants without any\nobjection or demur. The posts were duly sanctioned and in\nexistence and the appointments were against vacancies to such\nrequired posts. Therefore, the appointments of the appellants also\ndid not entail any additional financial liability which had not been\nanticipated or provided for. The University's yearly budgets would\nhave provided for the same.\n\n66. It is not the case of the University that the appellants were\nnot paid monies which were advanced to the University by the\nUniversity Grants Commission. In fact, the University Grants\nCommission has paid such amounts for well over a decade in as\nmuch as some of the members of the appellant no.1 have been\nappointed since 1993. Clearly, the appointment of the appellants to\nposts which were sanctioned under the recruitment rules, as\napproved by the University Grants Commission was not being\ntreated as appointments to posts which stood banned by the\nUniversity Grants Commission itself.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 26 of 49\n\n Objection that some of the persons appointed on contract basis\nwere related to other employees of the University\n\n67. It is also contended that some of the contract employees\nwere related to other employees of the Delhi University. Merely\nbecause an applicant for a post is related to an existing employee of\nthe organisation, cannot ipso facto be a ground for disqualification\nfor his/her appointment. Relationship per se would not render such\ncandidate as unmeritorious, unless there is evidence that the\nappointment was of a person not qualified or effected as a\nbackdoor entry.\n\n68. If the organisation was effecting employment of only\nrelatives of existing employees, then criticism on the ground that\nfavouritism in effecting appointments also could be levelled. It is\nnot so contended before us in the instant case.\n\n69. We also find that the University has made general and\nsweeping assertions without any specification before us. Such\nsweeping assertions cannot be relied on. Most importantly, the\nUniversity of Delhi has not been able to point out a single instance\nof a person, even a relative, who did possess the qualifications, as\nper the requirement, rules or did not deserve to be appointed. The\nUniversity is unable to point out a single person who has not\nundergone the qualifying test or the skill test or interview. We also\nnote that the respondents have no complaint that any of these\npersons are not rendering satisfactory service. No criticism ever or\na memo issued for inefficiency is available on the record placed\nbefore us.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 27 of 49\n\n Implementing reservation policy\n\n70. It has been submitted by Mr. Santosh Kumar, learned\ncounsel for the respondents that the proper reservation policy\nwhich mandates appointment of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes\nand OBC candidates has not been effected and that the roster as per\nthe pronouncement in the Supreme Court in \nR.K. Sabharwal &\nOrs. v. State of Punjab & Ors.\n (1995) 2 SCR 745 has not been\nimplemented in appointing the junior assistants on contract basis.\n\n71. It has been submitted by Mr. Sanjoy Ghose and Mr. Rajiv\nAggarwal, learned counsels for the appellants before us that the\ncontractual employees are from all categories and include persons\nfrom the general category as well as the scheduled castes,\nscheduled tribes and OBC categories and that the reservation can\nbe implemented.\n\n72. We have repeatedly put to the respondent no.1 to inform this\ncourt as to the number of the contractual employees and the\ndistribution of the contractual employees in terms of the above\ncategorisation. No such information has been supplied to us till we\nreserved judgment.\n\n Certainly, the directions of the Supreme Court and the\nreservation policy must be given effect to without any exception.\n\nDirective of the Ministry of Human Resource Development dated\n1st April, 2014\n\n73. During the course of arguments, Mr. Sudhir Nandrajog,\nlearned senior counsel has submitted that as late as on 1 st April,\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 28 of 49\n\n 2014, the Ministry of Human Resource Development had directed\nthat the ratio \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court in Uma Devi (supra)\nhas to be strictly followed. \nThis letter refers to an order dated 16 th\nDecember, 2016 of this court regarding the case of one \nAshok\nKumar v. The Vice Chancellor, Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan &\nAnr. This\n letter without anything more makes an incoherent\nreading and in any case relates to the case of Ashok Kumar in\nparticular only. But it cannot be denied that the law \nlaid down by\n\nthe Supreme Court has to be strictly applied.\n\nReference to Umadevi\n\n74. We now propose to discuss the directions of the Supreme\nCourt in the pronouncement reported at (\n2006) 4 SCC 1 Secretary,\nState of Karnataka & Ors. v. Umadevi\n(3) & Ors.\n\n In this case, the Supreme Court was concerned with a\nchallenge to matters of absorption, regularisation of permanent\ncontinuance of temporary, contractual, casual, daily wage or ad-\nhoc employees appointed/recruited and continued for long in public\nemployment dehors the constitutional scheme of public\nemployment.\n\n75. The judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme\nCourt was rendered on 10th April, 2006. The court noted the\nreference which was placed before the Constitution Bench in paras\n10, 12, 45, 46 and 55. In para 52, the court has declared that no\nwrit of mandamus should be issued in favour of employees\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 29 of 49\n\n notifying the government to make them permanent since the\nemployees cannot show that they have an enforceable legal right to\nbe permanently absorbed or that the state has a legal duty to make\nthem permanent. Both sides have drawn our attention to the\nfollowing observations in para 53 of the pronouncement :\n\n \"53. One aspect needs to be clarified. There may be\n cases where irregular appointments (not illegal\n appointments) as explained in S.V.\n Narayanappa [(1967) 1 SCR 128 : AIR 1967 SC\n 1071] , R.N. Nanjundappa [(1972) 1 SCC 409 :\n\n (1972) 2 SCR 799] and B.N. Nagarajan [(1979) 4\n SCC 507 : 1980 SCC (L&S) 4 : (1979) 3 SCR 937]\n and referred to in para 15 above, of duly qualified\n persons in duly sanctioned vacant posts might have\n been made and the employees have continued to\n work for ten years or more but without the\n intervention of orders of the courts or of tribunals.\n\n The question of regularisation of the services of\n such employees may have to be considered on\n merits in the light of the principles settled by this\n Court in the cases abovereferred to and in the light\n of this judgment. In that context, the Union of\n India, the State Governments and their\n instrumentalities should take steps to regularise as\n a one-time measure, the services of\n such irregularly appointed, who have worked for\n ten years or more in duly sanctioned posts but not\n under cover of orders of the courts or of tribunals\n and should further ensure that regular recruitments\n are undertaken to fill those vacant sanctioned posts\n that require to be filled up, in cases where temporary\n employees or daily wagers are being now employed.\n The process must be set in motion within six months\n from this date. We also clarify that regularisation, if\n any already made, but not sub judice, need not be\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 30 of 49\n\n reopened based on this judgment, but there should\n be no further bypassing of the constitutional\n requirement and regularising or making\n permanent, those not duly appointed as per the\n constitutional scheme.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n76. Mr. Santosh Kumar has further relied on the pronouncement\nof the Supreme Court reported at (2008) 10 SCC 1 Official\nLiquidator v. Dayanand & Ors. wherein reliance was placed on\nthe Constitution Bench pronouncement in Umadevi. This\njudgment was rendered in the context of a challenge laid to orders\nof Kolkata and Delhi High Court issuing directions to the appellant\nto absorb persons employed by the Official Liquidator attached to\nthose High Courts under Rule 308 of the Companies (Court) Rules,\n1959 against posts sanctioned by the Government of India,\nDepartment of Company Affairs. Reference has been made in para\n52 of this pronouncement to the fact situation that the Official\nLiquidator had issued advertisements for appointing company paid\nstaff and undertaken some sort of selection. The court had\nobserved that more qualified and meritorious persons must have\nshunned applying because they knew the employment would be\ntemporary and only mediocre applicants must have responded to\nthe advertisements and joined as company paid staff. It was in this\nbackground that the absorption of the company paid staff was\ntreated as violative of the doctrine of equity as enshrined in \nArticle\n14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 31 of 49\n\n 77. These observations may not have any application in the\npresent case as the notices were issued (some even on the\nUniversity website) notifying minimum essential qualifications\nwhich were the same as those prescribed under the extant\nRecruitment Rules.\n\n78. All persons were subjected to a written examination as well\nas a skill test and underwent the complete procedure as mandated\nunder the recruitment rules. Furthermore, the respondents did not\nadhere to the tenure and continued with the employment. Other\nthan a bald assertion, there is no exigency of service for the\ncontractual employment or explanation for the same at all rendered\nbefore us. The respondents have not only manifested the need for\nthe services of the employee, but we find that there has been\nexpansion of the total number of sanctioned posts of Junior\nAssistants. Such selection does not appear to have been\nundertaken in the Official Liquidator's case.\n\n79. We further find that in the Official Liquidator's case, the\nGovernment of India itself had framed a Scheme in 1978 as well\nas the 1999 Scheme for absorption of the company paid staff which\nwas duly implemented. Several employees stood regularised\nunder the 1999 scheme as well.\n\n80. It is urged with some vehemence by Mr. Santosh Kumar,\nlearned counsel that, even though there were sanctioned posts with\nvacancies, no scheme for regularisation of the contract labour even\nthough qualified, could be made for the Delhi University for the\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 32 of 49\n\n reasons of the ban of employment imposed by the University\nGrants Commission in the present case.\n\n81. It is further submitted that even if the ban was not in\noperation, none of the persons working as contract labour had\ncompleted 10 years of service. The submission is that the period of\n10 years of service referred to in para 53 in \nState of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi\n means 10 years service as on the date of the judgment. It\nis submitted by Mr. Santosh Kumar that in order to avail the\nbenefit of the scheme postulated by the court in Umadevi, the\nemployees should have completed 10 years service as on the date\nof the judgment i.e. 10th April, 2006 i.e. the date on which the\njudgment was rendered.\n \nIn support of this plea, reliance is placed\non the pronouncement reported at (\n2010) 9 SCC 247 State of\nKarnataka & Ors. v. M.L. Kesari & Ors.\n and \nRajender Prasad v.\nNHRC\n (2013) 136 DRJ 421 (DB). Per contra, it is pointed out by\nMr. Rajiv Aggarwal, learned counsel for the appellants that these\njudgments related to employees who had been appointed before the\njudgment was rendered.\n\n82. We find that this submission fails to consider the important\nfact that the University of Delhi continued to make contractual\nemployment despite the pronouncement in Umadevi.\n\n83. It is noteworthy that the decision in \nState of Karnataka v\nUmadevi\n was rendered on 10th April, 2006 wherein the 10 year\nwindow was given by the court. The respondents have not only\neffected appointments on contract labour after 10th April, 2006 but\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 33 of 49\n\n have also appointed/extended appointment of persons who had\nbeen appointed on contract basis after 10th April, 2006 when the\ndecision was rendered.\n\n84. This submission of the Delhi University, in any case, does\nnot need to detain us in view of the actions of the Delhi University\nas noted hereafter. We have noted above the advertisement issued\nby the respondent no.1 as late as in May, 2013 and the several steps\ntaken towards conducting the examination and the selection\npursuant to the advertisement.\n\nSubmission on behalf of the University premised on the Doctrine\nof election\n\n85. It is submitted by Mr. Santosh Kumar, learned counsel for\nthe University of Delhi that the University of Delhi had issued a\nnotification dated 6th November, 2013 inviting applications for\nappointment to 255 posts of Junior Assistants on regular basis. We\nfurther find that the University had taken care of the persons who\nwere working on contract basis in as much as a decision was taken\nby the Executive Council vide its Resolution No. 102 in the\nmeeting held on 29th October, 2008 which was publicised by the\nnotification dated 5th December, 2013 and reads as follows :-\n\n \"2. Clause (i) and (ii) of Rule 6 of the said\n Recruitment Rules prescribe an upper age limit for\n direct recruits in the Schedule and certain\n relaxation in age for departmental candidates.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 34 of 49\n\n 3. It is hereby notified that in terms of Rule 9 of the\n Recruitment Rules (Non-Teaching Employees)\n 2008, the maximum age limit will be relaxed to the\n extent of service rendered by them in respect of\n person who are already working on contract/daily\n wages/adhoc basis in the University/Colleges one\n time exemption provided they have put atleast one\n year of service. This exemption shall cease to be in\n operation with effect from 31.03.2014.\"\n\n (Emphasis by us)\n\n86. It is submitted that as a result, the University had been\nextremely liberal while giving the age relaxation even to\nemployees who had put barely one year of service and that\nexemption ceased to be operative with effect from 31 st March,\n2014.\n\n87. Learned counsel would contend that the prayer made in the\nwrit petition and the present appeal is barred by application of the\ndoctrine of election and that the respondents are prohibited from\nany relief in their writ petition on account of having participated in\nthe selection pursuant to the notification dated 5th December, 2013.\n\n88. \nIn this regard, reliance has been placed by Mr. Santosh\nKumar on the pronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at\n(\n2010) 4 SCC 753 Karam Kapahi & Ors v. Lal Chand Public\nCharitable Trust & Anr.\n wherein it was observed thus :\n\n \"52. The principle of election has been very\n felicitously expressed in the treatise Equity--A\n Course of Lectures by F.W. Maitland, Cambridge\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 35 of 49\n\n University, 1947. The learned author has explained\n the principle thus:\n\n \"The doctrine of election may be thus stated:\n That he who accepts a benefit under a deed or\n will or other instrument must adopt the whole\n contents of that instrument, must conform to all\n its provisions and renounce all rights that are\n inconsistent with it....\"\n\n xxx\n\n 57. Therefore, the common law doctrine of election\n is a part of our jurisprudence and squarely applies in\n this case inasmuch as the Club has advanced\n inconsistent pleas as noted hereinabove.\"\n\n This judgment was rendered in a factual context whereby\nrespondent was laying a challenge to the very lease under which it\nwas occupying the subject premises. It would have no application\nto the facts of the present case.\n\n89. There should be no challenge to the well settled principles of\nlaw. However, a different dimension to the consideration in terms\nof the notification dated 6th November, 2013 is pointed out.\nMr.Sharma, learned counsel for the appellants has placed reliance\non a Division Bench pronouncement of this court reported at 2013\n1 \nAD (Delhi) 779 S.K. Choudhary & Ors. Vs. Govt. of NCT of\nDelhi & Anr.\n and contends that this court has explained the\nmanner in which the principles \nlaid down in\n Umadevi must be\nworked. In this regard, learned counsel for the appellants has\nplaced reliance on the following directions by the Division Bench:-\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 36 of 49\n\n \"8. One more fact of importance needs to be noted.\n 35 posts of Junior Engineers are sanctioned as also\n created in DSIDC and when writ petitioners were,\n after induction in service as Work\n Assistants/Technical Supervisors made to perform\n duties as Junior Engineers or Assistant Engineers, 11\n vacant posts of Junior Engineers and Assistant\n Engineers existed in DSIDC.\n\n xxx\n\n \n10. The question which we are now called upon to\n address is the applicability of Paragraph 53 of the\n opinion of the Supreme Court in \nUmadevi\n's case,\n which otherwise holds that creation of posts is a\n power of the executive and no court can issue a\n mandamus, effect whereof is that the executive is\n to create a post. Directions to regularize employees\n have been treated as akin to an order creating a\n post. The reason is but obvious. Unless there exists a\n sanctioned post there cannot be an individual\n holding the post on regular basis. But an exception is\n carved out in para 53.\n\n xxx\n\n \n15. As explained by the Supreme Court in a later\n opinion reported as AIR 2010 SC 2587 State of\n Karnataka v. M.L. Kesari (refer Paragraph 8 of the\n opinion), the purport and object of afore-noted\n exception carved out by the Supreme Court\n \ninUmadevi\n's case was that those who possess the\n requisite qualifications and had served for long as\n daily wage/adhoc/casual employees but against\n sanctioned posts, should be entitled to be considered\n for their services being regularized in view of the\n long service rendered by them.\n\n \n16. But, what should be the process to subject these\n employees to be regularized in service was neither\n\nLPA 989/2013 Page 37 of 49\n\n opined upon by the Supreme Court\n in \nUmadevi\n's case or \nM.L. Kesari\n's case. We shall\n advert to this aspect a little later.\n\n \n17. The law on the subject needs to be understood\n with reference to Paragraph 3 of the decision\n in Umadevi'scase and the law declared by the\n Supreme Court in the three opinions reference\n whereto has been made in Paragraph 53 of the\n decision in \nUmadevi\n's case. The three decisions are:-\n\n (i) AIR 1967 SC 1071 State of Mysore v. S.V.\n Narayanappa;\n\n (ii) (1972) 1 SCC 409 R.N. Nanjundappa v. T.\n Thimmiah; and\n\n (iii) (1979) 4 SCC 507 B.N. Nagarajan v. State of\n Karnataka.\n\n \n18. The said three opinions, as explained in\n Paragraph 15 and 16 of the decision\n in \nUmadevi\n's case, draw a distinction between an\n illegal and an irregular appointment. Illegal\n appointment would be of a kind where there exists\n no sanctioned post and a person is appointed by\n means of a selection process which hits the very\n essence of a Recruitment Rule. An irregular\n appointment would be where a procedure to follow\n the appointment, not going to the root of the\n appointment is followed.\n\n 19. Now, a procedure or manner of appointment\n which goes to the root of the appointment would be\n where a person who is ineligible is appointed and\n there is no sanctioned post; eligibility, with\n reference to the educational, experience and age\n requirement is ignored.\n\nLPA 989/2013 Page 38 of 49\n\n 20. So understood, the facts of the instant case\n would bring out that the writ petitioners were\n irregularly appointed and not illegally appointed.\n xxx\n\n 22. Thus, the respondents would be obliged, as a\n one-time measure, to undertake the exercise to fill\n up the vacant sanctioned posts and while so doing,\n would be obliged to consider the 19 writ petitioners.\n xxx\n\n 25. Now, making petitioners compete with fresh\n graduate Engineers whose theoretical knowledge,\n being immediately out of college, would be most\n unfair.\n\n \n26. Noting that neither in \nUmadevi\n's case nor\n in \nM.K. Kesari\n's case the Supreme Court rendered\n an opinion as to what process of regularization\n should be adopted in cases where initial\n appointment was irregular and not illegal, we\n expand upon this subject by opining that the\n process through which irregular appointments\n need to be subjected to convert the same into\n regular appointments has to be a selection process\n devised where only the irregularly appointed\n employees are uniformly tested with respect to the\n minimum theory; keeping in view the experience\n gained by them. In other words, the test has not to\n be theoretical but an application based selection\n process.\n\n xxx\n\n 28. Since appointment of the petitioners was\n irregular and not illegal, in that, their existed vacant\n posts of Engineers in DSIDC when petitioners were\n inducted as Engineers and the petitioners were\n qualified, we dispose of the writ petition confirming\n\nLPA 989/2013 Page 39 of 49\n\n the impugned decision pronounced by the Tribunal\n but modify the same with reference to direction\n issued to advertise the posts and effect selection\n through DSSSB: by substituting the direction that\n the respondents would devise a suitable\n methodology to subject the writ petitioners to an\n induction test which would be designed with\n reference to application and not theory. Age\n relaxation benefit would be granted to the\n petitioners. As noted by us the fact not in dispute is\n that the petitioners possess the necessary educational\n qualifications.\"\n\n (Emphasis by us)\n\n90. Our attention is drawn to the order dated 9th January, 2013\nby the Supreme Court of India in Special Leave to Appeal (Civil)\nNo. 1115/2014 \nDSIDC v S.K. Chaudhary & Ors.\n which was\ndismissed as withdrawn with the liberty sought by the DSIDC to\napproach this court for a limited review as the direction to devise\nthe suitable methodology had to be issued to the Delhi State\nSubordinate Selection Board (the recruiting agency) and not the\nDSIDC. So far as the direction to devise the special test is\nconcerned, the same has not been disturbed.\n\n91. We are informed by Mr.Sudhir Nandrajog, learned senior\ncounsel that the educational qualification for the post of Junior\nAssistant though have been changed by the UGC and the rules\nhave been modified to this extent, however, the position before us\nis that the appellants possessed the essential educational\nqualification at the time of their initial appointment and they\ncontinue to do so even under the amended rules.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 40 of 49\n\n \n92. Learned counsel for the Delhi University would press that in\n\nS.K. Chaudhary v. Government of NCT of Delhi\n, it had taken the\ndecision to regularise the engineers and it was not so in the present\ncase. We find that in S.K. Chaudhary as well, the submission was\nthat the appointment of the petitioners was irregular and not illegal\nbut against vacant sanctioned posts. Even before the\npronouncement in Umadevi, the DSIDC made a request to the\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi on 19th September, 2002 as a one-\ntime measure to regularise the services of engineers who were\nworking with it which request was rejected by the Government of\nNCT of Delhi.\n\n93. The appellants have however urged that the respondents\nhave ignored one material factor in the manner in which they were\nsubjected to the written test. It is submitted that the University is\nconscious when it gave the age relaxation that the appellants were\npersons educationally and technically trained under courses and\ntraining programmes then in vogue. There is no dispute to the fact\nthat all such persons who applied possessed the prescribed\nqualifications and were eligible for consideration and appointment.\nThe qualifications and skills were acquired prior to the\nappointments on contract basis which have admittedly\ncontinued/renewed over a long period of time. As noted by us\nabove, the contract employees have rendered satisfactory service.\nHowever, fresh graduates who have undergone recent trainings\nwould have different skills and undergone different methodology.\nThe older applicants thus cannot be fairly tested on the same\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 41 of 49\n\n standards as fresh applicants who have just finished their education\nand trained recently.\n\n94. Mr. Sanjoy Ghose and Mr. Rajeev Aggarwal contend that\nthe test which the appellants were subjected is, therefore, neither\nfair nor appropriate and that the respondents ought to have taken\ninto consideration the fact that the appellants have been in service\nwith them for long periods and that they had and were rendering\ndecades of fruitful service to the organisation. It is submitted that\nthe respondents were required to design a test which assess the\nappellants taking into account the years when they entered the\nservice.\n\n95. The petitioner in \nS.K. Choudhary\n (supra) had the benefit of\norder for regularization by the Central Administrative Tribunal and\nthe challenge in the writ petition before the Division Bench was\nthat the law declared by the Supreme Court in \nUmadevi\n case\n(supra) did not warrant a general selection process to be completed\n(para 3). It is also noteworthy that the petitioners were seeking\nappointment to the post of Junior Engineers who had initially been\nrecruited as either Work Assistant, while some others were\nrecruited as Assistant Engineers. All the writ petitioners were\nqualified engineers.\n\n96. The respondents are pressing that the appellants are\nprohibited from any relief only for the reason because they have\nparticipated in the recruitment process. We find from the above\nnarration of facts that the respondents themselves deemed it fair to\ngrant the age relaxation to the persons working on contract basis\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 42 of 49\n\n with it, so much so that even such persons who had completed\nmerely one year as contract labour, were also given the benefit of\nage relaxation which is in consonance of the observations of the\nSupreme Court in para 53 of Umadevi. The respondents gave no\nwaiver of the eligibility conditions. None is sought by the\nappellants before us. The appellants have also not sought any\nexemption of the requirement of the recruitment rules to undergo\neither a written test or the skill test as per the amended recruitment\nrules. The doctrine of election does not prohibit an examination of\nthe contention that the evaluation of the appellants pursuant to the\nNotification of November, 2013 was not on a fair platform or basis.\n\n97. In response to our query, Mr. Santosh Kumar, learned\ncounsel for the Delhi University has informed that pursuant to the\nselection process initiated by the notification dated 6 th November,\n2013 the respondents were not able to fill up all the vacant posts.\n\n The above discussion can be summed thus:\n\n(i) The court undertakes the exercise of regularising the services\nof any person irregularly appointed.\n\n(ii) The appellants are either persons who were employed on\ncontract basis on the post of Junior Assistant against regular\nvacancies or are persons who were so employed who have formed\nthe appellant no.1 union. These appellants possessed the essential\nqualifications for appointment when they were inducted.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 43 of 49\n\n (iii\n) \nThe present case\n is concerned with appointment to the posts\nof Junior Assistant, a clerical post. The job does not entail any\ntechnical requirements.\n\n(iv) The job requirements of Junior Assistants in the Delhi\nUniversity has not substantially changed from the time when the\nappellants were initially appointed till date. The appellants have\nbeen rendering satisfactory service even on date.\n\n(v) The Delhi University has itself taken the decision to grant an\nopportunity to the contractual employees to participate in the\nregular selection.\n\n(vi) The Delhi University was unable to fill up all the vacancies\npursuant to the notification dated 6th November, 2013.\n\n(vii) The appellants assail the fairness of the opportunity granted\nby the University and the reasonableness as well as efficacy of the\nexamination to which persons must be subjected. This is the\nlimited aspect to which reference is made to S.K. Chaudhary's\npronouncement.\n\n(viii) Pursuant to the notification of November, 2013, the\nUniversity had verified that they possess the qualifications as per\nthe applicable rules even on date.\n\n(ix) There is, however, substance in the grievance of the\nappellants that the respondents ought to have designed a test which\nwould have suitably assessed the ability of the persons as the\nappellants who had been working with the respondent-University\non contract basis.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 44 of 49\n\n Petition not maintainable\n\n98. Lastly, it was urged before us that the writ petition at the\ninstant of an unregistered society was not maintainable. \nIn this\nregard, reference was made to the pronouncement of the Supreme\nCourt reported at (\n2006) 11 SC 731 B. Srinivasa Reddy v.\nKarnataka Urban Water Supply & Drainage Board Employees'\nAssn. & Ors. In\n this case, the association in question had claimed\nthat it was trade union registered under \nTrade Unions Act, 1996\n.\nThis averment, as a fact, was found to be false in as much as\nregistration of the first respondent under the \nTrade Union Act\n had\nbeen cancelled and it was not a registered or recognised union.\nThe writ petition had laid a challenge to the appointment of the\npetitioner to the post of Managing Director of the Board. No\npersonal claim of any worker was agitated. The locus standi of this\nunregistered trade union to do so was challenged.\n\n99. So far as the locus standi is concerned, in para 39, the court\nhad reiterated the well settled principle \"that if a citizen is no more\nthan a wayfarer or officious intervener without any interest or\nconcern that what belongs to anyone of the 660 million people of\nthis country... the doors of the court will not ajar for him.\"\n\n100. It was further held that the employees association had not\napproached the court with clean hands. In para 42, it was held that\nthe employees union had approached the court by suppressing\nmaterial facts and had snatched an order on the basis of wrong\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 45 of 49\n\n submissions when the Employees' Union had no locus standi to\nmaintain the writ petition on the relevant date.\n\n101. So far as the present case is concerned, we have noted above\nthat the petitioner nos. 2 and 3 are persons who stand employed on\ncontractual basis by the respondents. Therefore, even if we could\nagree with the respondent no.1 that the writ petition and appeal at\nthe instance of the petitioner no.1 was not maintainable, the writ\npetition and the appeal at the instance of the respondent nos. 2\nand 3 are maintainable.\n\nConclusion\nI. The decision of the University of Delhi to grant one time age\nexemption to all contract labour who may have served for over a\nyear on such basis for participating in the selection in effect is in\nthe nature of the Scheme postulated by the Supreme Court in para\n53 of Umadevi. It cannot be denied that such opportunity to\nparticipate in the selection process has to be meaningful.\nII. In view of the age relaxation given by the University of\nDelhi, an opportunity to undergo the selection process was made\navailable to all contract employees who had worked for one year or\nmore on contract. As a result of such opportunity, the contract\nworkers were rendered entitled to be tested on a realistic and fair\nscale and benchmark. There is substance in the grievance of the\ncontractual employees that to test them on the same standards as\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 46 of 49\n\n new applicants is to deprive them of a fair and meaningful\nopportunity to participate in the selection process.\nIII. The Delhi University admits that the contract employees\nwho applied under the last recruitment drive i.e. 6 th November,\n2013 possessed the requisite qualifications as per the recruitment\nrules of 2008. Regular vacant posts were available when they were\nappointed. Therefore, so far as all those who applied are concerned,\ntheir qualifications stand verified. Furthermore, their original\nappointments could also, at the worst, be termed irregular and not\nillegal.\n\nIV. There is substance in the grievance of the appellants that\npursuant to the notification dated 6th November, 2013, they have\nnot been subjected to a test that is fair and appropriate for them.\nThe respondent-University ought to have designed an appropriate\nmechanism for testing the appellants having regard to the date\nwhen they would have acquired their qualifications. Beside the\nappointment drive conducted by the respondent-University, they\nhave regular post available for making appointments pursuant to a\ntest appropriately designed for the appellants and other persons\nbased like them.\n\nV. The appellants and others like them have served the\norganisation for long years, and, it is evident that even if their\nhaving acquired academic qualifications much before the new\napplicants, the deficiency, if any, is made good by the valuable\nexperience acquired by them by virtue of the years of service. The\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 47 of 49\n\n learned Single Judge has fallen into error in treating the writ\npetition as one seeking a relief of regularisation.\nVI. The respondents were unable to fill up the vacancies\npursuant to the process initiated by the notification dated 6 th\nNovember, 2013 which are still available.\n\nVII. In view of the passage of time, it would be unfair to the\nappellants as well as the respondents to remand the matter for\nconsideration of the above. This court is adequately empowered to\nmould the relief to ensure complete justice to the parties.\n\nResult\n\n102. In view thereof, this appeal is disposed of with a direction to\nthe University of Delhi to design and hold an appropriate test for\nselection in terms of the notification dated 6th November, 2013\nhaving regard to the fact that the persons working on contract basis\ncovered under the notification dated 6th November, 2013 had\nobtained their essential qualifications much before the fresh\napplicants; that they have rendered satisfactory service and bring\nwith them the benefit of the knowledge acquired by experience\ngained while working on contract basis with the Delhi University.\n\n103. It is also clarified that the same persons who shall be so\ntested would be those who would be eligible pursuant to the\nadvertisement dated 6th November, 2013.\n\n LPA 989/2013 Page 48 of 49\n\n The impugned order of the Single Judge dated 16th\nDecember, 2013 is modified to this extent and the appeal is\ndisposed of with the above directions.\n\nCM Nos.20764/2013, 10976/2014\n\n In view of the order in the main LPA, these applications do\nnot survive for adjudication and are disposed of as such.\n\n GITA MITTAL, J\n\n P.S.
