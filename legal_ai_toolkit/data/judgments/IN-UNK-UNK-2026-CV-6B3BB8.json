Petitioner is brother-in-law (Jeth) of the deceased.\n\n The statement of brother of the deceased recorded\n u/S.161\n\nCr.P.C. Reveals that there were allegations of dowry demand against\n\nall the accused including the petitioner but the specific allegations of\n 2 M.Cr.C. No.43060/19\n\ndowry demand related cruelty inflicted soon before death is reflected\n\nfrom the SMS sent on 23/07/2019 by the deceased to her brother that\n\nmother-in-law (Guddi Bai), sister-in-law (Rani) & Husband\n\n(Gajendra) are inflicting physical cruelty upon the deceased.

No.43060/19\n\n the case may be;\n\n 4. The petitioner shall not commit and offence similar to the\n offence of which he is accused;\n\n 5. The petitioner will not seek unnecessary adjournments\n during the trial; and\n\n 6. The petitioner will not leave India without previous\n permission of the trial Court/Investigating Officer, as the\n case may be.\n\n 7. The petitioner shall mark his appearance before the\n concerned Police Station once in a week till conclusion of\n investigation.\n\n 8. The petitioner shall plant 25 saplings of indigenous fruit\n bearing or shady trees on the side of the road/street of the\n place of residence of petitioner or at any other place in the\n district which is earmarked by the Collector/Revenue\n Authority for planting trees and shall take care of the trees\n for the next one year by watering the plants and by\n installing tree guards at her own expenses. In case the\n petitioner is unable to afford incurring of such expenses,\n then he would obtain saplings/tree guard from the forest\n authorities (the concerned Forest Range Officer of the area)\n free of cost or at concessional/nominal rates available under\n any beneficial scheme of the Government. The petitioner\n shall file an affidavit disclosing compliance of this\n condition within 30 days in the Registry, failing which this\n court may consider cancellation of bail.\n\n 9. On complying with condition No.8 aforesaid, the petitioner\n is directed to inform the location of plantation made to the\n Forest Range Officer of the area concerned who will pass on\n this information to the DFO concerned.\n\n For effective implementation of this order in the interest of\n\nbetterment of ecology of the area concerned, the District Magistrate\n\nof district within which the petitioner resides is directed to assist the\n\npetitioner/accused to comply with condition No.8 by extending all\n\npossible financial and material assistance to the petitioner admissible\n\nunder any of the beneficial scheme for afforestation of the State.\n\n 4 M.Cr.C.
