JUSTICE M.NAGAPRASANNA)\n\n1. The petitioners in W.P. No.105364/2025, four in\n\nnumber and the petitioner in W.P. No.105664/2025, one in\n\nnumber, are at the doors of this Court calling in question an\n\nendorsement dated 04.08.2022, by which the claim of these\n\npetitioners seeking regularisation of their services has been\n\nturned down. The consequential direction to regularise the\n\nservices of the petitioners after completion of ten years from the\n\ndate of their initial appointment, is sought.\n\n2. Heard the learned Counsel Smt. Sanjana S.Mudhol\n\nappearing to the petitioners; learned AGA Shri V.S. Kalasurmath\n\nappearing for respondent Nos.1 to 3; and the learned counsel\n\nShri Srinand Pachhapure appearing for respondent No.4.\n\n3. Facts in brief germane are as follows:\n\nThe petitioners in W.P. No.105364/2025 were appointed as\n\nWatermen and the petitioner in W.P. No.105664/2025 was\n\nappointed as driver on Daily Wage Basis in Gokak City Municipal\n\n-5-\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nCouncil against sanctioned vacant posts. This is an admitted fact.\n\nThe particulars of appointment of the petitioners are as follows:\n\nIn W.P. No.105364 of 2025\n\nNumber of\nSl. Date of\nName of the petitioners year\nNo. appointment\ncompleted\n1 Nagesh Hanamant Pujeri 01/07/1997 28 years\n(Waterman)\n\n2. Balesh Yamanappa 01/11/1991 34 years\nMastamaradi (Waterman)\n\n3. Kumar Balayya Kumarmath 01/10/2004 21 years\n(Waterman)\n\n4. Kempanna Sattayappa Pujeri 01/10/2004 21 years\n(Waterman)\n\nIn W.P. No.105664 of 2025\n\nNumber of\nSl. Date of\nName of the petitioners year\nNo. appointment\ncompleted\nVithal Iranna Subhanji\n1 01.10.2004 20 years\n(Driver)\n\n4. In W.P. No.105364 of 2025, the first petitioner is\n\nappointed on 01.07.1997, the second petitioner on 01.11.1991,\n\nthird petitioner on 01.10.2004 and fourth petitioner on\n\n01.10.2004. Petitioner No.1, as on today completed 28 years of\n\nservices, petitioner No.2 has completed 34 years of service and\n\npetitioner Nos.3 and 4 have completed 21 years respectively. In\n\nW.P. No.105664 of 2025, the petitioner is appointed on\n\n01.10.2004.\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n5. The petitioners were at the doors of this Court\n\nseeking consideration of their cases for regularization in Writ\n\nPetition No.100103 of 2021, which comes to be disposed by an\n\norder dated 27.01.2021 directing consideration of the\n\nrepresentations submitted by these petitioners for regularisation\n\nof their services within two months from the date of receipt of\n\ncopy of the said order. The result of the direction is the\n\nimpugned endorsement dated 12.09.2022, which declines to\n\naccept the claim of these petitioners for regularisation of their\n\nservices on the score that the claim runs counter to the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nSECRETARY, STATE\n\nOF KARNATAKA VS. UMADEVI\n(3)1.\n\n6. The petitioners again had approached this Court in\n\nWrit Petition No.100174 of 2023 in which the endorsement dated\n\n12.09.2022 was not challenged. The Co-ordinate Bench of this\n\nCourt disposed the writ petition reserving liberty to the\n\npetitioners to raise a challenge to the said endorsement. As an\n\noffshoot of the order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench in Writ\n\nPetition No.100174 of 2023 comes the impugned endorsement\n(2006) 4 SCC 1\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\ndated 23.07.2024, rejecting the claim of the petitioners on the\n\nvery same ground that the petitioners have not completed 10\n\nyears of service as on the cut-off date as obtaining in the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nUMADEVI\n(3)\n\n(supra). It is the aforesaid endorsements that have driven these\n\npetitioners to this Court in the subject petitions.\n\n7. Learned counsel Smt. Sanjana S.Mudhol representing\n\nthe petitioners would vehemently contend that the petitioners\n\nhave been in continuous employment as waterman and driver in\n\nthe fourth respondent Municipal Council without any break. It is\n\nmore than 20 years each of these petitioners have been working.\n\nThe two directions of consideration of their cases for\n\nregularisation at the hands of this Court have become no avail\n\nfor the reason that the State is now wanting to rely on the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nUMADEVI\n(3)\n\n(supra) to deny the claim of the petitioners.\n\nLearned counsel\n\nsubmits that the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of\n\nUMADEVI\n(3) (supra) is distinguished in subsequent\n\njudgments.\n\n-8-\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n8. Learned HCGP would vehemently refute the\n\nsubmission to contend that as on the date of rendering of the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nUMADEVI\n(3)\n\n(supra), none of the petitioners had completed 10 years of\n\nservice. Therefore, the claim of these petitioners cannot be\n\nconsidered. The other submission is that in the year 2017, the\n\nlist of eligible candidates for the purpose of regularisation was\n\nalready notified by the Municipal Council, in which the names of\n\nthe petitioners were not found. No objections were filed by these\n\npetitioners or their claim was never registered that they are\n\nentitled for regularisation at the relevant point in time and\n\ntherefore, learned counsel submits that this Court should not\n\nentertain the plea of these petitioners seeking regularisation at\n\nthis juncture.\n\n9. Learned counsel Shri Srinand Pachhapure appearing\n\nfor respondent No.4 submits that they have recommended the\n\ncases of these petitioners for regularisation and communicated to\n\nthe State on 15.01.2025 and therefore submits that he has no\n\nfurther say in the matter as it is the State which has to pass an\n\norder.\n\n-9-\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n10. I have given my anxious consideration to the\n\nsubmissions of the learned counsel for parties and have perused\n\nthe material on record.\n\n11. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The dates\n\non which the petitioners entered employment is charted herein\n\nabove. The dates are again not in dispute. The issue is whether\n\nthese petitioners would become entitled to consideration of their\n\ncases for regularisation or otherwise. The petitioners were twice\n\nover before this Court seeking consideration of their cases for\n\nregularisation, which all come to be rejected by the impugned\n\nendorsements. The endorsement is that the petitioners had not\n\ncompleted 10 years of service as on the date of the rendering of\n\nthe judgment of the Apex Court in the case of\nUMADEVI\n(3)\n\n(supra), which is on 10.04.2006. It is germane to notice that in\n\nidentical circumstances this Court in Writ Petition No.107774 of\n\n2023 and connected matters concerning a different Municipal\n\nCouncil had directed regularisation of those petitioners by the\n\nfollowing order:\n\n12. \"The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute,\nthey are all a matter of record, the dates link in the chain\nof events, the appointment of the petitioners, are all\nagain a matter of record and undisputed facts. The\npetitioners have as on today rendered 33, 29, 28 & 26\n\n- 10 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nyears respectively in the 4th respondent - Municipality,\nbe it in the cadre of cleaner, sweeper, poura karmika or a\ndriver, nonetheless they are all working in the 4th\nrespondent-Municipality, from the respective dates of\ntheir appointment. Uninterruptedly, till 2025 i.e.,\ntoday, the employment of these petitioners, are not\nlitigious as their services are never continued on the\nbasis of any interim order granted at the hands of this\nCourt. They are in continuous employment owing their\nnecessity in the 4th respondent- Municipality and the\nnecessity still prevails. The 4th respondent has filed its\nstatement of objections, where it is admitted that the\npetitioners are working from the dates of the respective\nengagements till today. The contention of the State that\nregularization orders should not be passed for the\nasking is noted only to be rejected as these petitioners\nhave toiled in the 4th respondent - Municipality at their\nprime luth right from 33 years, 26 years respectively.\nToday, they are all aged between 56 to 60 years. If today\nthey are sent home without any benefit of regularization,\nthey would be wondering in their retired life.\n\n13.\nIn identical circumstances, the Apex Court in\nthe case of\nShripal vs. Nagar Nigam\nreported in 2025\nSSC OnLine SC 221 has held as follows:\n\n\"3. The factual matrix leading up to\nthe appeal before us is as follows:\n\nThe Appellant Workmen claim to have\nbeen engaged as Gardeners (Malis) in the\nHorticulture Department of the Respondent\nEmployer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam, since the year\n1998 (in some instances, since 1999). According\nto them, they continuously discharged horticultural\nand maintenance duties-- such as planting trees,\nmaintaining parks, and beautifying public spaces--\nunder the direct supervision of the Respondent\nEmployer. They further allege that no formal\nappointment letters were ever issued to them, and\nthat they were persistently denied minimum wages,\nweekly offs, national holidays, and other statutory\nbenefits.\n\nIn 2004, the Appellant Workmen,\nalong with many other similarly situated\n- 11 -\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nemployees, raised an industrial dispute (C.B. Case\nNo. 6 of 2004) before the Conciliation Officer at\nGhaziabad, seeking regularization of their services\nand the requisite statutory benefits. They contend\nthat, upon learning of this demand, the\nRespondent Employer began delaying their salaries\nand subjected them to adverse working conditions.\nEventually, around mid-July 2005, the services of\nnumerous workmen were allegedly terminated\norally, without any notice, written orders, or\nretrenchment compensation.\n\nSince the above termination took place\nduring the pendency of the conciliation\nproceedings, the Appellant Workmen argue it\nviolated\nSection 6E\nof the U.P. Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947. Consequently, the State Government\nreferred the disputes concerning both (i)\nregularization and\n\n(ii) legality of the alleged termination, to the\nLabour Court, Ghaziabad for adjudication.\n\nThe Labour Court proceeded to decide\nthe references vide two orders:\n\n(i) Order dated 03.06.2011 : In numerous\nadjudication cases (e.g., Adjudication Case\nNos. 448, 451, 467 of 2006, etc.), the Labour\nCourt passed awards holding the\nterminations illegal for want of compliance\nwith\nSection 6N\nof the U.P. Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947, and directed\nreinstatement with 30% back wages.\n\n(ii) Order dated 11.10.2011 : However, in\nabout 41 other adjudication cases (e.g.,\nAdjudication Case Nos. 269, 270, 272,\netc.), the Labour Court arrived at a\ncontrary conclusion, dismissing the claims\non the finding that the concerned workmen\nhad not been engaged directly by the Nagar\nNigam but rather through a contractor, and\nhence had no enforceable right to\nreinstatement or regularization against the\nRespondent Employer.\n\n- 12 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nAggrieved by the adverse portion of the\nawards (i.e., those granting reinstatement), the\nRespondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam,\nfiled several writ petitions before the High Court of\nJudicature at Allahabad, challenging the Labour\nCourt's findings. On the other hand, the workmen\nwhose claims were dismissed by the other set of\nawards also approached the High Court by filing\ntheir own writ petitions. All these writ petitions\nwere heard together, culminating in the common\njudgment dated 01.03.2019, which partly modified\nthe Labour Court's conclusions.\n\nThrough the impugned judgment, the\nHigh Court held that while the Labour Court\nwas correct in exercising jurisdiction under\nthe\nU.P. Industrial Disputes Act\n(since\nmunicipalities could be treated as \"industry\"),\nthere remained factual complexities as to\nwhether the workmen were genuinely on the\nrolls of the Nagar Nigam or were provided by\ncontractors. The High Court also noted that\nthe State Government had, by\nnotifications/orders, placed a ban on fresh\nrecruitments in Municipal Corporations,\nthereby restricting direct appointments to any\npost.\n\nUltimately, the High Court partially\nmodified the relief granted, directing re-\nengagement of the workmen on daily wages,\nwith pay equivalent to the minimum in the\nregular pay scale of Gardeners, while allowing\nfuture consideration of their regularization if\npermissible by law.\n\n4. Both the Appellant Workmen and the\nRespondent Employer have now approached this\nCourt by way of Special Leave Petitions. The\nworkmen primarily seek full reinstatement with\nback wages and a direction to secure their\nregularization, whereas the Respondent Employer\nseeks to quash the modifications ordered by the\nHigh Court on the ground that the High Court\nexceeded its jurisdiction by granting partial relief\nakin to regular employees, contrary to\n\n- 13 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nconstitutional provisions and the State's ban on\nrecruitment.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the Appellant\nWorkmen made the following submissions:\n\nI. Continuous Service & Comparable Duties\n: The Appellant Workmen had continuously\ndischarged horticultural and maintenance\nduties-- like planting trees, upkeep of public\nparks, and general beautification--under the\ndirect supervision and control of the\nRespondent Employer for periods often\nexceeding a decade. They insist such\nlongstanding, continuous work parallels that\nof permanent Gardeners.\n\nII. Direct Engagement & Wage\nDisbursement : They aver that their\nwages, though inadequate, were paid\ndirectly by the Horticulture Department of\nthe Respondent Employer, nullifying the\nEmployer's claim of contractual hiring.\nMuster rolls and internal notes are cited to\nshow direct employer-employee relations.\n\nIII. Illegal Termination : Alleging violation of\n\nSections 6E\nand\n6N\nof the U.P. Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947, the Appellant Workmen\nmaintain their abrupt termination in July\n2005 (during pendency of conciliation\nproceedings) was devoid of due process and\nstatutory payments, rendering it patently\nillegal.\n\nIV. Entitlement to Reinstatement &\nRegularization : Given their long service\nand the principle of \"equal pay for equal\nwork,\" the Appellant Workmen submit they\ndeserve full reinstatement with back wages\nand a legitimate pathway to regularization,\nas opposed to the partial relief of mere daily-\nwage re-engagement prescribed by the High\nCourt.\n\n6. On the other, the learned counsel for\n\n- 14 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nthe Respondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam\nmade the following submissions:\n\nI. Compliance with Constitutional\nRequirements: Emphasizing the\nconstitutional scheme of public employment,\nit is urged that there was (and remains) a\nban on fresh recruitment in Municipal\nCorporations, and no proper selection\nprocess was ever followed to appoint the\nWorkmen on any sanctioned posts.\n\nII. No Direct Employer-Employee\nRelationship : The Respondent Employer\ncontends that all horticulture work was\ncarried out through independent contractors\nappointed via tender processes. It claims any\npartial wage documentation cited by the\nWorkmen fails to establish direct\nengagement.\n\nIII. Inapplicability of Regularization :\n\nRelying on\nSecretary, State of Karnataka v.\nUmadevi1\n, it is asserted that no daily\nwager can claim permanent absorption\nwithout adherence to constitutional\nrequirements and availability of duly\nsanctioned vacancies.\n\nIV. Inadequate Proof of 240 Days' Service\n: The Respondent Employer points out that\nthe Workmen did not convincingly\ndemonstrate they completed 240 days of\ncontinuous work in any calendar year, thus\nundermining the assertion that their\ncessation from service was illegal.\n\nV. Challenge to Modified Relief: Finally, it\nargues that the High Court's direction to pay\nminimum-scale wages and to consider the\nWorkmen for future regularization oversteps\nlegal boundaries, disregards the recruitment\nban, and fosters an impermissible avenue of\npublic employment. The Respondent\nEmployer, therefore, seeks the quashing of\nthe impugned judgment.\n\n- 15 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n7. Having heard the arguments and\nsubmissions of the learned counsel for the parties\nand having perused the record, this Court is of\nthe considered opinion that the nature of\nengagement of the Appellant Workmen, the\nadmitted shortage of Gardeners, and the\ncircumstances under which their services were\nbrought to an end, merit closer scrutiny.\n\n8. It is undisputed that, while the\nAppellant Workmen were pressing for\nregularization and proper wages through pending\nconciliation proceedings, the Respondent Employer\nproceeded to discontinue their services, without\nissuing prior notice or granting retrenchment\ncompensation. At this juncture, it is to have a look\nat the requirements of\nSection 6E\nof the U.P.\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947 which has been\nreproduced hereunder:--\n\n\"6E. [Conditions of service, etc. to remain\nunchanged in certain circumstances during the\npendency of proceedings. [Inserted by U.P. Act No.\n1 of 1957.]\n\n(1) During the pendency of any conciliation\nproceeding before a Conciliation Officer or a Board\nor of any proceeding before a Labour Court or\nTribunal in respect of an industrial dispute, no\nemployer shall,\n\n(a) in regard to any matter connected with the\ndispute, alter, to the prejudice of the\nworkmen concerned in such dispute, the\nconditions of service applicable to them\nimmediately before the commencement of\nsuch proceeding, or\n\n(b) for any misconduct connected with the\ndispute, discharge or punish, whether by\ndismissal or otherwise any workman\nconcerned in such dispute save with the\nexpress permission in writing of the authority\nbefore which the proceeding is pending.\n\n(2) During the pendency of any such proceeding\n\n- 16 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nin respect of an industrial dispute, the employer\nmay, in accordance with the standing orders\napplicable to a workman concerned in such dispute,\n\n-\n\n(a) alter, in regard to any matter not connected\nwith the dispute, the conditions of service\napplicable to that workman\nimmediately before the commencement of\nsuch proceeding, or\n\n(b) for any misconduct not connected with the\ndispute, discharge or punish, whether by\ndismissal or otherwise:\n\nProvided that no such workman shall be\ndischarged or dismissed, unless he has been paid\nwages for one month and an application has been\nmade by the employer to the authority before\nwhich the proceeding is pending for approval of\nthe action taken by the employer.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-\n\nsection (2) no employer shall during the pendency\nof any such proceeding in respect of an industrial\ndispute, take any action against any protected\nworkman concerned in such dispute, -\n\n(a) by altering, to the prejudice of such protected\nworkman, the conditions of service applicable\nto him immediately before the\ncommencement of such proceeding, or\n\n(b) by discharging or punishing, whether by\ndismissal or otherwise, such protected\nworkman, such with the express permission\nin writing of the authority before which the\nproceeding is pending. Explanation. - For the\npurposes of this sub-section, a 'protected\nworkman' in relation to an establishment,\nmeans a workman who, being an officer of a\nregistered trade union connected with the\nestablishment, is recognized as such in\naccordance with rules made in this behalf.\n\n(4) In every establishment, the number of\n\n- 17 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nworkmen to be recognized as protected workmen\nfor the purposes of sub-section (3) shall not exceed\none per cent of the total number of workmen\nemployed therein subject to a minimum number of\nfive protected workmen and a maximum number\nof one hundred protected workmen and for the\naforesaid purpose, the State Government may\nmake rules providing for the distribution of such\nprotected workmen among various trade unions, if\nany, connected with the establishment and the\nmanner in which they may be chosen and\nrecognized as protected workmen.\n\n(5) Where an employer makes an application to\na Board, Labour Court or Tribunal under the proviso\nto sub-section (2) for approval of the action taken\nby him, the authority concerned shall, without\ndelay, hear such application and pass, as\nexpeditiously as possible, such order in relation\nthereto as it deems fit.\"\n\n9. On a plain reading of this section,\nwe can deduce that any unilateral alteration\nin service conditions, including termination, is\nimpermissible during the pendency of such\nproceedings unless prior approval is obtained\nfrom the appropriate authority. The record in\nthe present case does not indicate that the\nRespondent Employer ever sought or was\ngranted the requisite approval. Prima facie,\ntherefore, this conduct reflects a deliberate\nattempt to circumvent the lawful claims of\nthe workmen, particularly when their dispute\nover regularization and wages remained sub\njudice.\n\n10. The Respondent Employer consistently\nlabelled the Appellant Workmen as casual\nemployees (or workers engaged through an\nunnamed contractor), yet there is no material proof\nof adherence to\nSection 6N\nof the U.P. Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947, which mandates a proper\nnotice or wages in lieu thereof as well as\nretrenchment compensation. In this context,\nwhether an individual is classified as regular or\ntemporary is irrelevant as retrenchment obligations\n\n- 18 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nunder the Act must be met in all cases attracting\nSection 6N. Any termination thus effected without\nstatutory safeguards cannot be undertaken lightly.\n\n11. xxxx\n\n12. xxxx\n\n13. xxxx\n\n14. The Respondent Employer places\nreliance on\nUmadevi\n(supra)2 to contend that\ndaily-wage or temporary employees cannot\nclaim permanent absorption in the absence of\nstatutory rules providing such absorption.\nHowever, as frequently reiterated, Uma\nDevi itself distinguishes between\nappointments that are \"illegal\" and those that\nare \"irregular,\" the latter being eligible for\nregularization if they meet certain\nconditions. More importantly, Uma Devi\ncannot serve as a shield to justify exploitative\nengagements persisting for years without the\nEmployer undertaking legitimate recruitment.\nGiven the record which shows no true\ncontractor-based arrangement and a\nconsistent need for permanent horticultural\nstaff the alleged asserted ban on fresh\nrecruitment, though real, cannot justify\nindefinite daily-wage status or continued\nunfair practices.\n\n15. It is manifest that the Appellant\nWorkmen continuously rendered their\nservices over several years, sometimes\nspanning more than a decade. Even if certain\nmuster rolls were not produced in full, the\nEmployer's failure to furnish such records--\ndespite directions to do so--allows an\nadverse inference under well-established\nlabour jurisprudence. Indian labour law\nstrongly disfavors perpetual daily-wage or\ncontractual engagements in circumstances\nwhere the work is permanent in nature.\n\n- 19 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nMorally and legally, workers who fulfil\nongoing municipal requirements year after\nyear cannot be dismissed summarily as\ndispensable, particularly in the absence of a\ngenuine contractor agreement. At this\njuncture, it would be appropriate to recall the\nbroader critique of indefinite \"temporary\"\nemployment practices as done by a recent\njudgment of this court in Jaggo v. Union of\nIndia3 in the following paragraphs:\n\n\"xxxxxxxxx\"\n\n16. xxx\n\n17. xxx\n\n18. The impugned order of the High Court,\nto the extent they confine the Appellant Workmen\nto future daily- wage engagement without\ncontinuity or meaningful back wages, is hereby set\naside with the following directions:\n\nI. The discontinuation of the Appellant\nWorkmen's services, effected without\ncompliance with Section 6E and\nSection 6N\n\nof the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is\ndeclared illegal. All orders or\ncommunications terminating their services\nare quashed. In consequence, the Appellant\nWorkmen shall be treated as continuing in\nservice from the date of their termination,\nfor all purposes, including seniority and\ncontinuity in service.\n\nII. The Respondent Employer shall reinstate the\nAppellant Workmen in their respective\nposts (or posts akin to the duties they\npreviously performed) within four weeks\nfrom the date of this judgment. Their entire\nperiod of absence (from the date of\ntermination until actual reinstatement) shall\nbe counted for continuity of service and all\nconsequential benefits, such as seniority\nand eligibility for promotions, if any.\n\n- 20 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nIII. Considering the length of service, the\nAppellant Workmen shall be entitled to\n50% of the back wages from the date of\ntheir discontinuation until their actual\nreinstatement. The Respondent\nEmployer shall clear the aforesaid dues\nwithin three months from the date of\ntheir reinstatement.\n\nIV. The Respondent Employer is directed to\ninitiate a fair and transparent process\nfor regularizing the Appellant Workmen\nwithin six months from the date of\nreinstatement, duly considering the fact\nthat they have performed perennial\nmunicipal duties akin to permanent\nposts. In assessing regularization, the\nEmployer shall not impose educational\nor procedural criteria retroactively if\nsuch requirements were never applied\nto the Appellant Workmen or to\nsimilarly situated regular employees in\nthe past. To the extent that\nsanctioned vacancies for such duties\nexist or are required, the Respondent\nEmployer shall expedite all necessary\nadministrative processes to ensure\nthese long-time employees are not\nindefinitely retained on daily wages\ncontrary to statutory and equitable\nnorms.\n\n19. In view of the above, the appeal(s)\nfiled by the workmen are allowed, whereas the\nappeal(s) filed by the Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad are\ndismissed.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\"\n\nThe Apex Court was considering the cases of those\npersons, who are appointed on work charged\nestablishment, the petitioners are similarly situated. The\nApex Court was considering the cases where services\nwere terminated, re-instated, pursuant to the orders of\nthe Labour Court therein. Nonetheless, the Apex Court\nobserves that they are in continuous employment for over\n\n- 21 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n3 decades there and directs regularization. The\npetitioners in the case at hand are in service for more\nthan 3 decades in certain cases and close to 3 decades in\ncertain cases. In that light, the claim of the petitioners\ncould not have been denied on a spacious plea that there\nis no resolution of the Town Municipal Council appended\nto the requisition to the Deputy Commissioner.\n\n14. The Town Municipal Council has filed its\nobjections accepting the fact that the petitioners are in\nemployment throughout. If that be so, the very reason\nrendered by the Deputy Commissioner may be inter\nalia. But one of the reasons rendered is unacceptable, nor\nthe rejection of the applications of the petitioners, is\nacceptable.\n\n15. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:\n\nORDER\n\ni. Petitions are allowed.\n\nii. The impugned order dated 24.03.2023\npassed by the 3rd respondent vide\nAnnexure-S in W.P.No.107774/2023,\nthe impugned order dated 27.10.2022\npassed by the 3rd respondent vide\nAnnexure-S in W.P.No.100470/2023,\nthe impugned order dated 27.10.2022\npassed by the 3rd respondent vide\nAnnexure-P in W.P.No.100471/2023 &\nthe impugned order dated 27.10.2022\npassed by the 3rd respondent vide\nAnnexure-S in W.P.No.100477/2023\nstand quashed.\n\niii.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid direction, the\n\nimpugned endorsement hinges upon the judgment of the Apex\n\nCourt in the case of\nUMADEVI\n(3) (supra), which has stood\n\ndistinguished by subsequent judgments of the Apex Court.\n\n13.

All these endorsements would run foul of what the\n\nApex Court has held from time to time. This Court, in W.P.\n\nNo.100556 of 2024 disposed on 20.02.2025, rendered in the\n\n- 33 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\naftermath of the judgment in the case of\nUMADEVI\n(supra),\n\nhas held as follows:\n\n\"14. As observed hereinabove, the Apex Court\nrendered its judgment in the case of UMADEVI (3) on\n10-04-2006. Relevant paragraphs are already quoted\nhereinabove. Subsequent to the judgment of the Apex\nCourt in the case of UMADEVI (3), considering the case\nof UMADEVI (3), the Apex Court in several judgments\nheld and affirmed the right of several employees for\nregularization under several circumstances. The Apex\nCourt in the case of\nNARENDRA KUMAR\nTIWARI v. STATE OF JHARKHAND2\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"7. The purpose and intent of the decision\nin\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] was\ntherefore twofold, namely, to prevent irregular or\nillegal appointments in the future and secondly, to\nconfer a benefit on those who had been irregularly\nappointed in the past.\n\nThe fact that the State of\nJharkhand continued with the irregular\nappointments for almost a decade after the\ndecision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] is a clear indication that it believes\nthat it was all right to continue with irregular\nappointments, and whenever required, terminate\nthe services of the irregularly appointed employees\non the ground that they were irregularly appointed.\n\nThis is nothing but a form of exploitation of the\nemployees by not giving them the benefits of\nregularisation and by placing the sword of\nDamocles over their head. This is precisely\nwhat\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]\nand Kesari [State of Karnataka v. M.L.\nKesari, (2010) 9 SCC 247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S)\n826] sought to avoid.\n(2018) 8 SCC 238\n\n- 34 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n8. If a strict and literal interpretation,\nforgetting the spirit of the decision of the\nConstitution Bench in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753], is to be taken into consideration\nthen no irregularly appointed employee of the State\nof Jharkhand could ever be regularised since that\nState came into existence only on 15-11-2000 and\nthe cut-off date was fixed as 10-4-2006. In other\nwords, in this manner the pernicious practice\nof indefinitely continuing irregularly\nappointed employees would be perpetuated\ncontrary to the intent of the Constitution\nBench.\n\n9. The High Court as well as the State of\nJharkhand ought to have considered the\nentire issue in a contextual perspective and\nnot only from the point of view of the interest\nof the State, financial or otherwise - the\ninterest of the employees is also required to\nbe kept in mind. What has eventually been\nachieved by the State of Jharkhand is to short\ncircuit the process of regular appointments\nand instead make appointments on an\nirregular basis. This is hardly good\ngovernance.\n\n10. Under the circumstances, we are of the\nview that the Regularisation Rules must be given a\npragmatic interpretation and the appellants, if they\nhave completed 10 years of service on the date of\npromulgation of the Regularisation Rules, ought to\nbe given the benefit of the service rendered by\nthem. If they have completed 10 years of\nservice they should be regularised unless\nthere is some valid objection to their\nregularisation like misconduct, etc.\n\n11. The impugned judgment and order [\nAnil\nKumar Sinha v. State of Jharkhand\n, 2016 SCC\nOnLine Jhar 2904] passed by the High Court is set\naside in view of our conclusions. The State should\ntake a decision within four months from today on\n\n- 35 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nregularisation of the status of the appellants. The\nappeals are accordingly disposed of.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n15. Later, the Apex Court in the case of\nSHEO\nNARAIN NAGAR v. STATE OF U.P.3\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"6. The learned counsel appearing on behalf\nof the respondent has relied upon para 44 of the\ndecision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753], so as to contend that it was not\nthe case of irregular appointment but of illegal\nappointment; there was no post available on which\nthe services of the appellants could have been\nregularised and appointment were in contravention\nof the reservation policy also; thus, termination\norder was rightly issued and, in no case, the\nappellants were entitled for regularisation of their\nservices.\n\n7. When we consider the prevailing scenario,\nit is painful to note that the decision in\nUmadevi (3)\n[State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] has not been properly\nunderstood and rather wrongly applied by various\nState Governments. We have called for the data in\nthe instant case to ensure as to how many\nemployees were working on contract basis or ad\nhoc basis or daily-wage basis in different State\ndepartments. We can take judicial notice that\nwidely aforesaid practice is being continued.\nThough this Court has emphasised that incumbents\nshould be appointed on regular basis as per rules\nbut new devise of making appointment on contract\nbasis has been adopted, employment is offered on\ndaily-wage basis, etc. in exploitative forms.\n\nThis\nsituation was not envisaged by\nUmadevi (3) [State\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. The prime intendment of\nthe decision was that the employment process\nshould be by fair means and not by back door entry\n(2018) 13 SCC 432\n\n- 36 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nand in the available pay scale. That spirit of\nthe\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] has been ignored and conveniently\noverlooked by various State\nGovernments/authorities.\n\nWe regretfully make the\nobservation that\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] has not been implemented in its\ntrue spirit and has not been followed in its pith and\nsubstance. It is being used only as a tool for\nnot regularising the services of incumbents.\n\nThey are being continued in service without\npayment of due salary for which they are\nentitled on the basis of\nArticles 14\n, 16\nread\nwith\nArticle 34(1)(d)\nof the Constitution of\nIndia as if they have no constitutional\nprotection as envisaged in D.S. Nakara v. Union\nof India [D.S. Nakara v. Union of India, (1983) 1\nSCC 305 : 1983 SCC (L&S) 145 : AIR 1983 SC\n130], from cradle to grave. In heydays of life\nthey are serving on exploitative terms with no\nguarantee of livelihood to be continued and in\nold age they are going to be destituted, there\nbeing no provision for pension, retiral\nbenefits, etc. There is clear contravention of\nconstitutional provisions and aspiration of\ndowntrodden class. They do have equal rights\nand to make them equals they require\nprotection and cannot be dealt with\narbitrarily. The kind of treatment meted out is\nnot only bad but equally unconstitutional and\nis denial of rights.\nWe have to strike a balance\nto really implement the ideology of\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753].\n\nThus, the time\nhas come to stop the situation where\nUmadevi\n(3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4\nSCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753] can be permitted\nto be flouted, whereas, this Court has\ninterdicted such employment way back in the\nyear 2006.\n\nThe employment cannot be on\nexploitative terms, whereas\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] laid down that there should not be\n\n- 37 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nback door entry and every post should be filled by\nregular employment, but a new device has been\nadopted for making appointment on payment of\npaltry system on contract/ad hoc basis or\notherwise. This kind of action is not permissible\nwhen we consider the pith and substance of true\nspirit in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753].\n\n8. Coming to the facts of the instant case,\nthere was a direction issued way back in the year\n1999, to consider the regularisation of the\nappellants. However, regularisation was not done.\nThe respondents chose to give minimum of the pay\nscale, which was available to the regular\nemployees, way back in the year 2000 and by\npassing an order, the appellants were also\nconferred temporary status in the year 2006, with\nretrospective effect on 2-10-2002. As the\nrespondents have themselves chosen to confer a\ntemporary status to the employees, as such there\nwas requirement at work and posts were also\navailable at the particular point of time when order\nwas passed. Thus, the submission raised by the\nlearned counsel for the respondent that posts were\nnot available, is belied by their own action.\nObviously, the order was passed considering the\nlong period of services rendered by the appellants,\nwhich were taken on exploitative terms.\n\n9. The High Court dismissed the writ application\nrelying on the decision in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1: 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753]. But the appellants were\nemployed basically in the year 1993; they had\nrendered service for three years, when they\nwere offered the service on contract basis; it\nwas not the case of back door entry; and\nthere were no Rules in place for offering such\nkind of appointment. Thus, the appointment\ncould not be said to be illegal and in\ncontravention of Rules, as there were no such\nRules available at the relevant point of time,\nwhen their temporary status was conferred\n\n- 38 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nw.e.f. 2-10-2002. The appellants were\nrequired to be appointed on regular basis as a\none-time measure, as\nlaid down in\npara 53\nof\nUmadevi (3) [State of Karnataka v. Umadevi\n\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753]. Since\nthe appellants had completed 10 years of\nservice and temporary status had been given\nby the respondents with retrospective effect\nfrom 2-10-2002, we direct that the services of\nthe appellants be regularised from the said\ndate i.e. 2.10.2002, consequential benefits\nand the arrears of pay also to be paid to the\nappellants within a period of three months\nfrom today.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n16. The Apex Court in the case of\nCHANDER\nMOHAN NEGI v. STATE OF H.P.4\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"11. At the outset, it is to be noted that the\nschemes in question were notified in the years\n2001 and 2003 under which appointments were\nmade with regard to Primary Assistant Teachers\nand Teachers in other categories. At the relevant\npoint of time, nobody has questioned either the\nschemes or the appointments. It is the specific case\nof the respondent State that such appointments\nhave not affected the writ petitioners and the\nDepartment was not in a position to leave the\nschools, Teachers deficient for long since it would\nhave affected the studies of the students very\nbadly. Therefore, it was the case of the State that\nTeachers had been appointed under various\nschemes at that point of time and such\nappointments have been made up to the year 2007\nand have no impact on the appellants since they\nhave completed their two-year JBT training in the\nyear 2011. As is evident from the order [\nPankaj\nKumar v. State of H.P.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944]\nunder appeal passed by the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court, the appellant-writ petitioners have not\neven chosen to file rejoinder and the stand taken\nby the State thus has remained uncontroverted.\n(2020) 5 SCC 732\n\n- 39 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nFurther, it is also to be noted that when such\nappointments were made during the years 2001\nand 2003 the writ petitions came to be filed in the\nyears 2012 and 2013. As the writ petitioners have\nclaimed interest for their appointment, the Division\nBench of the High Court has rightly held [\nPankaj\nKumar v. State of H.P.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine HP 5944]\nthat such petitions cannot be considered as the\npublic interest litigation. Such a writ petition which\nwas filed by the petitioners who came to be\nqualified only in the year 2011 are not entitled for\nany relief on the ground of unexplained laches and\ninordinate delay of about more than 10 years in\napproaching the court for questioning the\nappointments. Though relief was sought against the\nState to deny the benefit of regularisation to the\nappointed Teachers, they were not even impleaded\nas party respondents. An association was\nimpleaded as third respondent but without\nfurnishing any material to show that at least\nmajority of appointees are members of such\nassociation.\n\nSo far as Primary Assistant Teachers\nScheme of 2003, which was the subject-matter of\nletters patent appeal arising out of CWP No. 3303\nof 2012-A filed by Chander Mohan Negi and others,\nis concerned, the appellants in Civil Appeal No.\n2813 of 2017 except Appellants 1, 2 and 4 have\nwithdrawn [\nChander Mohan Negi v. State of\nH.P.\n, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 459] the appeal and\nAppellants 1 and 4 are already appointed as JBTs.\nInsofar as the only appellant viz. Appellant 2, Rajiv\nChauhan is concerned, it is stated that he is\nqualified and there are vacant posts and he can be\nconsidered if he applies to any of the existing\nvacancies. So far as the Primary Assistant Teacher\nScheme is concerned, same was notified as early\nas on 27-8-2003. As is evident from the Scheme\nitself, the object of the Scheme appears to be to\ncompulsorily enrol children in schools for\nelementary and primary education in the remote\nareas to achieve the goals as set by the\nGovernment while enacting the Himachal Pradesh\nCompulsory Primary Education Act, 1997 with a\nview to achieve the target of 100% enrolment to\nchildren. As per the Scheme, the eligibility was\n\n- 40 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n10+2 from a recognised Board/University and the\ncandidates with higher qualifications were also\neligible and candidates with professional\nqualifications were to be preferred. As per the\nregular Recruitment Rules the requisite qualification\nfor the post of JBT Teacher during the relevant time\nwas 10+2 with 50% marks and JBT certificate. As\nsubmitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing\nfor the State that initially though 3500 odd\nTeachers were appointed, as of now there are only\na total of 3294 Teachers working in this category\nand out of this about 1866 had the qualification of\n10+2 with more than 50% marks at the relevant\npoint of engagement. Out of the balance, 1015 had\n10+2 with less than 50% marks, but they had\nhigher qualification such as BA/MA/M Sc or B Ed,\netc. Further, it is also brought to our notice that out\nof all the candidates, 3294 candidates who are\npresently working have acquired the professional\nqualification of diploma in elementary education or\nhave undergone Professional Development\nProgramme for Elementary Teachers. In that view\nof the matter, we are of the view that when the\nappointees appointed under the scheme have\ncompleted more than almost 15 years of service\nnow and also have acquired the professional\nqualifications, they cannot be denied regularisation\nat this point of time. As the appointments were\nmade as per the schemes notified by the\nGovernment such appointments cannot be treated\nas illegal, if at all they can be considered irregular.\nWhen it is the plea of the State that in view of the\nhard topography/tribal areas in the State, large\nnumber of vacancies were there even in single\nteacher schools and to achieve the object of the\nHimachal Pradesh Primary Education Act, 1997\nsuch steps were taken, there is no reason to\ndisbelieve the same, more so, in absence of any\naffidavit by way of rejoinder by the writ petitioners\nbefore the High Court controverting the allegations\nin the reply filed on behalf of the State.\n\n12. Even with regard to the Para Teachers\nPolicy under which various category of Teachers\nwere appointed in the year 2003 pursuant to policy\n\n- 41 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nnotified on 17-9-2003 it is clear from the record\nplaced before this Court that all the persons who\nwere recruited as Para Teachers were fully qualified\nas per the Recruitment and Promotion Rules i.e.\nthe Himachal Pradesh Education Department Class\nIII (School and Inspection Cadre) Service Rules,\n1973. In view of the stand of the State that such\npolicy was necessitated due to large number of\nvacant posts which have arisen year after year and\nwhich could not be filled since the State Selection\nSubordinate Board, Hamirpur, which was\nresponsible for the selection of Teachers had come\nunder a cloud and the selection process had come\nto a halt, such appointments cannot be rendered as\nillegal. Such aspect is also evident from the policy\nitself. Even in other category of the Grant-in-Aid to\nParent Teacher Association Rules, all Teachers\nappointed under the Scheme fulfil the educational\nqualifications prescribed in the Rules. For such kind\nof Teachers, the Cabinet has taken decision to take\nover the Teachers on contract basis after\ncompletion of eight years of service which period\nwas later reduced to seven years. It is also brought\nto our notice during the course of arguments that\nout of the total 6799 Teachers, 5017 Teachers were\nalready taken over on contract basis by the State\nGovernment and only 1782 could not be taken over\nin view of the interim orders passed by this Court.\n\n13. It is true that in the initial schemes\nnotified by the Government, there was a\ncondition that such appointees should not\nseek regularisation/ absorption but at the\nsame time for no fault of them, they cannot be\ndenied regularisation/absorption. It is in view\nof the requirement of the State, their services\nwere extended from time to time and now all\nthe appointees have completed more than 15\nyears of service. For majority of the appointed\nTeachers under the various schemes, benefit\nwas already extended and some left over\ncandidates were denied on account of interim\norders passed by this Court. With regard to\nPrimary Assistant Teachers, it is stated that\nall the candidates have completed Special\n\n- 42 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nTeacher Training Qualifying Condensed\nCourse and also had obtained special JBT\ncertificate after 5 years' continuous service in\nterms of the Himachal Pradesh Education\nCode, 1985. The judgments relied on by\nlearned counsel Shri Prashant Bhushan also\nwould not render any assistance to the case\nof the appellants herein for the reason that\nthere was unexplained and inordinate delay\non the part of the appellants in approaching\nthe High Court and further having regard to\nexplanation offered by the State about the\nneed of framing such policies to meet the\nimmediate requirement to fill up single\nteacher schools which were vacant for a very\nlong time, having regard to topographical\nconditions, which is not even controverted by\nway of any rejoinder before the High Court. In\nsuch view of the matter, taking the totality of\npeculiar circumstances of these cases, we are\nof the view that the view expressed by this\nCourt in the judgments relied on cannot be\napplied to the facts of the case on hand. All\nthe appointed candidates are working for the\nmeagre salaries pursuant to schemes notified\nby the Government. Except the vague\nsubmission that such schemes were framed\nonly to make backdoor entries, there is no\nmaterial placed on record to buttress such\nsubmission. Further it is also to be noted that\nthough such schemes were notified as early\nas in 2003, nobody has questioned such\npolicies and appointments up to 2012 and\n2013. The writ petition i.e. CWP No. 3303 of\n2012-A was filed in the year 2012 without\neven impleading the appointees as party\nrespondents. In the writ petition, there was\nno rejoinder filed by the writ petitioners\ndisputing the averments of the State as stated\nin the reply-affidavit. Having regard to the\nnature of such appointments, appointments\nmade as per policies cannot be termed as\nillegal.

State of H.P.\n, 2014 SCC\nOnLine HP 5944] by the High Court, we are of\nthe view that no case is made out to interfere\nwith the impugned judgment [\nPankaj\nKumar v. State of H.P.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine HP\n5944] of the High Court.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n17. Earlier to the judgment rendered by the Apex\nCourt in the afore-quoted judgment, the Apex Court in\nthe case of\nAMARENDRA KUMAR\nMOHAPATRA v. STATE OF ORISSA5\n, had held as\nfollows:\n\n\"42. The decision in Umadevi (3) case [\nState\nof Karnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC\n1 : 2006 SCC (L&S) 753], as noticed earlier,\npermitted regularisation of regular appointments\nand not illegal appointments.\n\nQuestion, however, is\nwhether the appointments in the instant case could\nbe described as illegal and if they were not,\nwhether the State could be directed to regularise\nthe services of the degree-holder Junior Engineers\nwho have worked as ad hoc Assistant Engineers for\nsuch a long period, not only on the analogy of the\nlegislative enactment for regularisation but also on\nthe principle underlying para 53 of the decision\nin Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753].\n\n43. As to what would constitute an\nirregular appointment is no longer res integra.\nThe decision of this Court in\nState of\nKarnataka v. M.L. Kesari\n[(2010) 9 SCC\n247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], has examined\nthat question and explained the principle\nregarding regularisation as enunciated\nin Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753]. The decision\nin that case\n\nsummed up the following three essentials for\nregularisation : (1) the employees have\n(2014) 4 SCC 583\n\n- 44 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nworked for ten years or more, (2) that they\nhave so worked in a duly sanctioned post\nwithout the benefit or protection of the\ninterim order of any court or tribunal, and (3)\nthey should have possessed the minimum\nqualification stipulated for the appointment.\nSubject to these three requirements being\nsatisfied, even if the appointment process did\nnot involve open competitive selection, the\nappointment would be treated irregular and\nnot illegal and thereby qualify for\nregularisation. Para 7 in this regard is\napposite and may be extracted at this\nstage: (M.L. Kesari case [(2010) 9 SCC\n247 : (2010) 2 SCC (L&S) 826], SCC p. 250)\n\n\"7.\nIt is evident from the above that there is\nan exception to the general principles against\n'regularisation' enunciated in\nUmadevi (3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753], if the following conditions are\nfulfilled:\n\n(i) The employee concerned should have\nworked for 10 years or more in a duly\nsanctioned post without the benefit or\nprotection of the interim order of any court\nor tribunal. In other words, the State\nGovernment or its instrumentality should\nhave employed the employee and continued\nhim in service voluntarily and continuously\nfor more than ten years.\n\n(ii) The appointment of such employee should\nnot be illegal, even if irregular. Where the\nappointments are not made or continued\nagainst sanctioned posts or where the\npersons appointed do not possess the\nprescribed minimum qualifications, the\nappointments will be considered to be illegal.\n\nBut where the person employed possessed\nthe prescribed qualifications and was working\nagainst sanctioned posts, but had been\nselected without undergoing the process of\nopen competitive selection, such\n\n- 45 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nappointments are considered to be\nirregular.\"\n\n44. It is nobody's case that the degree-\nholder Junior Engineers were not qualified for\nappointment as Assistant Engineers as even\nthey possess degrees from recognised\ninstitutions. It is also nobody's case that they\nwere not appointed against the sanctioned\npost. There was some debate as to the actual\nnumber of vacancies available from time to\ntime but we have no hesitation in holding that\nthe appointments made were at all relevant\npoints of time against sanctioned posts. The\ninformation provided by Mr. Nageswara Rao,\nlearned Additional Solicitor General,\nappearing for the State of Orissa, in fact,\nsuggests that the number of vacancies was at\nall points of time more than the number of\nappointments made on ad hoc basis. It is also\nclear that each one of the degree-holders has\nworked for more than 10 years ever since his\nappointment as ad hoc Assistant Engineer. It\nis in that view difficult to describe these\nappointments of the Stipendiary Engineers on\nad hoc basis to be illegal so as to fall beyond\nthe purview of the scheme envisaged\nin Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753].\n\n45. The upshot of the above discussion is\nthat not only because in Umadevi (3) case [\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753] this Court did not disturb the\nappointments already made or regularisation\ngranted, but also because the decision itself\npermitted regularisation in case of irregular\nappointments, the legislative enactment granting\nsuch regularisation does not call for interference at\nthis late stage when those appointed or regularised\nhave already started retiring having served their\nrespective departments, in some cases for as long\nas 22 years.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n- 46 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n18. A three Judges bench of the Apex Court\nconsidering the case of\nUMADEVI (3\n) supra and\nsubsequent judgments, in the case of\nPREM\nSINGH v. STATE OF U.P.\n, holds as follows:\n\n\"36. There are some of the employees who\nhave not been regularised in spite of having\nrendered the services for 30-40 or more years\nwhereas they have been superannuated. As they\nhave worked in the work-charged establishment,\nnot against any particular project, their services\nought to have been regularised under the\nGovernment instructions and even as per the\ndecision of this Court in\nState of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(\n3) [State of\nKarnataka v. Umadevi\n(3), (2006) 4 SCC 1 : 2006\nSCC (L&S) 753]. This Court in\nthe said decision\n\nhas laid down that in case services have been\nrendered for more than ten years without the\ncover of the Court's order, as one-time\nmeasure, the services be regularised of such\nemployees. In the facts of the case, those\nemployees who have worked for ten years or\nmore should have been regularised. It would\nnot be proper to regulate them for\nconsideration of regularisation as others have\nbeen regularised, we direct that their services\nbe treated as a regular one. However, it is\nmade clear that they shall not be entitled to\nclaiming any dues of difference in wages had\nthey been continued in service regularly\nbefore attaining the age of superannuation.\nThey shall be entitled to receive the pension\nas if they have retired from the regular\nestablishment and the services rendered by\nthem right from the day they entered the\nwork-charged establishment shall be counted\nas qualifying service for purpose of pension.\n\n37. In view of reading down Rule 3(8) of the\nU.P. Retirement Benefits Rules, 1961, we hold that\nservices rendered in the work-charged\n(2019) 10 SCC 516\n\n- 47 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nestablishment shall be treated as qualifying service\nunder the aforesaid rule for grant of pension. The\narrears of pension shall be confined to three years\nonly before the date of the order. Let the\nadmissible benefits be paid accordingly within three\nmonths. Resultantly, the appeals filed by the\nemployees are allowed and filed by the State are\ndismissed.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\n19. The Apex Court later, in the case of JAGGO v.\nUNION OF INDIA7 has held as follows:\n\n\"7. They urged the High Court to\nrecognize their long and continuous service,\nthe nature of their work, and the lack of any\nbackdoor or illegal entry. They highlighted\nthat they had functioned without any break,\nperformed tasks equivalent to regular\nemployees, and had been assigned duties\nessential to the regular upkeep, cleanliness,\nand maintenance of the respondent's offices.\nThe High Court, after examining the Tribunal's\ndecision and the submissions advanced,\nconcluded that the petitioners before it were\npart-time workers who had not been\nappointed against sanctioned posts, nor had\nthey performed a sufficient duration of full-\ntime service to satisfy the criteria for\nregularization. It relied on the principle laid down\nin\nSecretary, State of Karnataka v. Uma\nDevi3\nholding that the petitioners could not claim a\nvested right to be absorbed or regularized without\nfulfilling the requisite conditions. The High Court\nfurther observed that the petitioners did not\npossess the minimum educational qualifications\nordinarily required for regular appointments, and\nadditionally noted that the employer had\nsubsequently outsourced the relevant\nhousekeeping and maintenance activities.\nConcluding that there was no legal basis to grant\nthe reliefs sought, the High Court dismissed the\n2024 SCC OnLine SC 3826\n\n- 48 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nwrit petition. Aggrieved by this rejection, the\nappellants have approached this Court by way of\nthese appeals.\n\n8. On behalf of the appellants, the following\narguments have been advanced before us:\n\n(i). Continuous and Substantive\nEngagement: The appellants emphasize\ntheir long, uninterrupted service spanning\nwell over a decade--and in some instances,\nexceeding two decades. They argue that\ntheir duties were neither sporadic nor\nproject-based but permanent and integral to\nthe daily functioning of the respondent's\noffices.\n\n(ii). Nature of Duties: Their responsibilities--\n\nsuch as cleaning, dusting, gardening, and\nother maintenance tasks--were not casual or\nperipheral. Instead, they were central to\nensuring a clean, orderly, and functional\nwork environment, effectively aligning with\nroles typically associated with regular posts.\n\n(iii). Absence of Performance\nIssues: Throughout their tenure, the\n\nappellants were never issued any warning or\nadverse remarks. They highlight that their\nwork was consistently satisfactory, and there\nwas no indication from the respondents that\ntheir performance was not satisfactory or\nrequired improvement.\n\n(iv). Compliance with 'Uma Devi'\nGuidelines: The appellants assert that their\nappointments were not \"illegal\" but at most\n\"irregular.\" Drawing on the principles\nlaid\ndown in\n\nSecretary, State of\nKarnataka v. Uma Devi\n, they submit that\nlong-serving employees in irregular\nappointments--who fulfil essential,\nsanctioned functions--are entitled to\nconsideration for regularization.\n\n- 49 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n(v). Discrimination in Regularization: The\nappellants point out that individuals with\nfewer years of service or similar\nengagements have been regularized. They\ncontend that denying them the same benefit,\ndespite their longer service and crucial role,\nconstitutes arbitrary and discriminatory\ntreatment.\n\n(vi). Irrelevance of Educational\nQualifications: The appellants reject the\nrespondents' reliance on formal educational\nrequirements, noting that such criteria were\nnever enforced earlier and that the nature of\ntheir work does not inherently demand\nformal schooling. They argue that\nretrospectively imposing such qualifications\nis unjustified given their proven capability\nover many years.\n\n(vii). Equity and Fairness: Ultimately, the\nappellants submit that the High Court erred\nby focusing too rigidly on their initial terms\nof engagement and ignoring the substantive\nreality of their long, integral service. They\nmaintain that fairness, equity, and\nestablished judicial principles call for their\nregularization rather than abrupt termination\n\n9. On the other hand, the following primary\narguments have been advanced before us on behalf\nof the Respondents:\n\n(i). Nature of Engagement: The respondents\nmaintain that the appellants were engaged\npurely on a part-time, contractual basis,\nlimited to a few hours a day, and that their\nwork was never intended to be permanent or\nfull-time.\n\n(ii). Absence of Sanctioned Posts: They assert\nthat the appellants were not appointed\nagainst any sanctioned posts. According to\nthe respondents, without sanctioned\nvacancies, there can be no question of\n\n- 50 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nregularization or absorption into the\npermanent workforce.\n\n(iii). Non-Compliance with 'Uma Devi'\nCriteria: Relying heavily on\nSecretary, State\nof Karnataka v. Uma Devi\n(supra), the\nrespondents argue that the appellants do not\nmeet the conditions necessary for\nregularization. They emphasize that merely\nserving a long period on a part-time or ad-\nhoc basis does not create a right to be\nregularized.\n\n(iv). Educational Qualifications: The\nrespondents contend that even if the\nappellants were to be considered for regular\nappointments, they do not possess the\nminimum educational qualifications\nmandated for regular recruitment. This, in\ntheir view, disqualifies the appellants from\nbeing absorbed into regular service.\n\n(v). Outsourcing as a Legitimate Policy\nDecision: The respondents point out that\nthey have chosen to outsource the relevant\nhousekeeping and maintenance work to a\nprivate agency. This, they argue, is a\nlegitimate administrative policy decision\naimed at improving efficiency and cannot be\ninterfered with by the courts.\n\n(vi). No Fundamental Right to\nRegularization: Finally, the respondents\nunderscore that no employee, merely by\nvirtue of long-standing temporary or part-\ntime engagement, acquires a vested right to\nbe regularized. They maintain that the\nappellants' claims are devoid of any legal\nentitlement and that the High Court was\ncorrect in dismissing their petition.\n\n10. Having given careful consideration\nto the submissions advanced and the material\non record, we find that the appellants' long\nand uninterrupted service, for periods\n\n- 51 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nextending well beyond ten years, cannot be\nbrushed aside merely by labelling their initial\nappointments as part-time or contractual. The\nessence of their employment must be\nconsidered in the light of their sustained\ncontribution, the integral nature of their work,\nand the fact that no evidence suggests their\nentry was through any illegal or surreptitious\nroute.\n\n11. The appellants, throughout their tenure,\nwere engaged in performing essential duties that\nwere indispensable to the day-to-day functioning of\nthe offices of the Central Water Commission\n(CWC). Applicant Nos. 1, 2, and 3, as Safaiwalis,\nwere responsible for maintaining hygiene,\ncleanliness, and a conducive working environment\nwithin the office premises. Their duties involved\nsweeping, dusting, and cleaning of floors,\nworkstations, and common areas--a set of\nresponsibilities that directly contributed to the basic\noperational functionality of the CWC. Applicant No.\n5, in the role of a Khallasi (with additional functions\nakin to those of a Mali), was entrusted with critical\nmaintenance tasks, including gardening, upkeep of\noutdoor premises, and ensuring orderly\nsurroundings.\n\n12. Despite being labelled as \"part-time\nworkers,\" the appellants performed these\nessential tasks on a daily and continuous\nbasis over extensive periods, ranging from\nover a decade to nearly two decades. Their\nengagement was not sporadic or temporary in\nnature; instead, it was recurrent, regular, and\nakin to the responsibilities typically\nassociated with sanctioned posts. Moreover,\nthe respondents did not engage any other\npersonnel for these tasks during the\nappellants' tenure, underscoring the\nindispensable nature of their work.\n\n13. The claim by the respondents that\nthese were not regular posts lacks merit, as\nthe nature of the work performed by the\n\n- 52 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nappellants was perennial and fundamental to\nthe functioning of the offices. The recurring\nnature of these duties necessitates their\nclassification as regular posts, irrespective of\nhow their initial engagements were labelled.\nIt is also noteworthy that subsequent\noutsourcing of these same tasks to private\nagencies after the appellants' termination\ndemonstrates the inherent need for these\nservices. This act of outsourcing, which\neffectively replaced one set of workers with\nanother, further underscores that the work in\nquestion was neither temporary nor\noccasional.\n\n14. xxx\n\n15. xxx\n\n16. The appellants' consistent\nperformance over their long tenures further\nsolidifies their claim for regularization. At no\npoint during their engagement did the\nrespondents raise any issues regarding their\ncompetence or performance. On the contrary,\ntheir services were extended repeatedly over\nthe years, and their remuneration, though\nminimal, was incrementally increased which\nwas an implicit acknowledgment of their\nsatisfactory performance. The respondents'\nbelated plea of alleged unsatisfactory service\nappears to be an afterthought and lacks\ncredibility.\n\n17. As for the argument relating to\neducational qualifications, we find it untenable in\nthe present context. The nature of duties the\nappellants performed--cleaning, sweeping, dusting,\nand gardening--does not inherently mandate\nformal educational prerequisites. It would be unjust\nto rely on educational criteria that were never\ncentral to their engagement or the performance of\ntheir duties for decades. Moreover, the respondents\nthemselves have, by their conduct, shown that\nsuch criteria were not strictly enforced in other\n\n- 53 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\ncases of regularization. The appellants' long-\nstanding satisfactory performance itself attests to\ntheir capability to discharge these functions,\nmaking rigid insistence on formal educational\nrequirements an unreasonable hurdle.\n\n18. xxx\n\n19. It is evident from the foregoing that the\nappellants' roles were not only essential but also\nindistinguishable from those of regular employees.\nTheir sustained contributions over extended\nperiods, coupled with absence of any adverse\nrecord, warrant equitable treatment and\nregularization of their services. Denial of this\nbenefit, followed by their arbitrary termination,\namounts to manifest injustice and must be\nrectified.\n\n20. It is well established that the\ndecision in\nUma Devi\n(supra) does not intend\nto penalize employees who have rendered\nlong years of service fulfilling ongoing and\nnecessary functions of the State or its\ninstrumentalities. The said judgment sought\nto prevent backdoor entries and illegal\nappointments that circumvent constitutional\nrequirements. However, where appointments\nwere not illegal but possibly \"irregular,\" and\nwhere employees had served continuously\nagainst the backdrop of sanctioned functions\nfor a considerable period, the need for a fair\nand humane resolution becomes paramount.\nProlonged, continuous, and unblemished\nservice performing tasks inherently required\non a regular basis can, over the time,\ntransform what was initially ad-hoc or\ntemporary into a scenario demanding fair\nregularization.\n\nIn a recent judgment of this\nCourt in\nVinod Kumar v. Union of India5\n, it\nwas held that held that procedural formalities\ncannot be used to deny regularization of\nservice to an employee whose appointment\nwas termed \"temporary\" but has performed\nthe same duties as performed by the regular\n\n- 54 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nemployee over a considerable period in the\ncapacity of the regular employee. The relevant\nparas of this judgment have been reproduced\nbelow:\n\n\"6. The application of the judgment\nin\nUma Devi\n(supra) by the High Court does\nnot fit squarely with the facts at hand, given\nthe specific circumstances under which the\nappellants were employed and have\ncontinued their service. The reliance on\nprocedural formalities at the outset cannot\nbe used to perpetually deny substantive\nrights that have accrued over a considerable\nperiod through continuous service.\n\nTheir\npromotion was based on a specific\nnotification for vacancies and a subsequent\ncircular, followed by a selection process\ninvolving written tests and interviews, which\ndistinguishes their case from the\nappointments through back door entry as\ndiscussed in the case of\nUma Devi\n(supra).\n\n7. The judgment in the case\nUma Devi\n\n(supra) also distinguished between\n\"irregular\" and \"illegal\" appointments\nunderscoring the importance of considering\ncertain appointments even if were not made\nstrictly in accordance with the prescribed\nRules and Procedure, cannot be said to have\nbeen made illegally if they had followed the\nprocedures of regular appointments such as\nconduct of written examinations or\ninterviews as in the present case...\"\n\n21. The High Court placed undue\nemphasis on the initial label of the appellants'\nengagements and the outsourcing decision\ntaken after their dismissal. Courts must look\nbeyond the surface labels and consider the\nrealities of employment : continuous, long-\nterm service, indispensable duties, and\nabsence of any mala fide or illegalities in their\nappointments. In that light, refusing\nregularization simply because their original\n\n- 55 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nterms did not explicitly state so, or because\nan outsourcing policy was belatedly\nintroduced, would be contrary to principles of\nfairness and equity.\n\n22. The pervasive misuse of temporary\nemployment contracts, as exemplified in this case,\nreflects a broader systemic issue that adversely\naffects workers' rights and job security. In the\nprivate sector, the rise of the gig economy has led\nto an increase in precarious employment\narrangements, often characterized by lack of\nbenefits, job security, and fair treatment. Such\npractices have been criticized for exploiting workers\nand undermining labour standards. Government\ninstitutions, entrusted with upholding the principles\nof fairness and justice, bear an even greater\nresponsibility to avoid such exploitative\nemployment practices. When public sector entities\nengage in misuse of temporary contracts, it not\nonly mirrors the detrimental trends observed in the\ngig economy but also sets a concerning precedent\nthat can erode public trust in governmental\noperations.\n\n23. The International Labour Organization\n(ILO), of which India is a founding member, has\nconsistently advocated for employment stability\nand the fair treatment of workers. The ILO's\nMultinational Enterprises Declaration6 encourages\ncompanies to provide stable employment and to\nobserve obligations concerning employment\nstability and social security. It emphasizes that\nenterprises should assume a leading role in\npromoting employment security, particularly in\ncontexts where job discontinuation could\nexacerbate long-term unemployment.\n\n24. The landmark judgment of the United\nState in the case of Vizcaino v. Microsoft\nCorporation7 serves as a pertinent example from\nthe private sector, illustrating the consequences of\nmisclassifying employees to circumvent providing\nbenefits. In this case, Microsoft classified certain\nworkers as independent contractors, thereby\n\n- 56 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\ndenying them employee benefits. The U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that these\nworkers were, in fact, common-law employees and\nwere entitled to the same benefits as regular\nemployees. The Court noted that large\nCorporations have increasingly adopted the practice\nof hiring temporary employees or independent\ncontractors as a means of avoiding payment of\nemployee benefits, thereby increasing their profits.\nThis judgment underscores the principle that the\nnature of the work performed, rather than the label\nassigned to the worker, should determine\nemployment status and the corresponding rights\nand benefits. It highlights the judiciary's role in\nrectifying such misclassifications and ensuring that\nworkers receive fair treatment.\n\n25. It is a disconcerting reality that\ntemporary employees, particularly in government\ninstitutions, often face multifaceted forms of\nexploitation. While the foundational purpose of\ntemporary contracts may have been to address\nshort-term or seasonal needs, they have\nincreasingly become a mechanism to evade long-\nterm obligations owed to employees. These\npractices manifest in several ways:\n\n• Misuse of \"Temporary\" Labels: Employees\nengaged for work that is essential, recurring,\nand integral to the functioning of an\ninstitution are often labeled as \"temporary\" or\n\"contractual,\" even when their roles mirror\nthose of regular employees. Such\nmisclassification deprives workers of the\ndignity, security, and benefits that regular\nemployees are entitled to, despite performing\nidentical tasks.\n\n• Arbitrary Termination: Temporary employees\nare frequently dismissed without cause or notice,\nas seen in the present case. This practice\nundermines the principles of natural justice and\nsubjects workers to a state of constant insecurity,\nregardless of the quality or duration of their\nservice.\n\n- 57 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n• Lack of Career Progression: Temporary\nemployees often find themselves excluded from\nopportunities for skill development, promotions, or\nincremental pay raises. They remain stagnant in\ntheir roles, creating a systemic disparity between\nthem and their regular counterparts, despite their\ncontributions being equally significant.\n\n• Using Outsourcing as a Shield: Institutions\nincreasingly resort to outsourcing roles\nperformed by temporary employees,\neffectively replacing one set of exploited\nworkers with another. This practice not only\nperpetuates exploitation but also\ndemonstrates a deliberate effort to bypass the\nobligation to offer regular employment.\n\n• Denial of Basic Rights and\nBenefits: Temporary employees are often denied\nfundamental benefits such as pension, provident\nfund, health insurance, and paid leave, even when\ntheir tenure spans decades. This lack of social\nsecurity subjects them and their families to undue\nhardship, especially in cases of illness, retirement,\nor unforeseen circumstances.\n\n26. While the judgment in\nUma\nDevi\n(supra) sought to curtail the practice of\nbackdoor entries and ensure appointments\nadhered to constitutional principles, it is\nregrettable that its principles are often\nmisinterpreted or misapplied to deny\nlegitimate claims of long-serving employees.\nThis judgment aimed to distinguish between\n\"illegal\" and \"irregular\" appointments. It\ncategorically held that employees in irregular\nappointments, who were engaged in duly\nsanctioned posts and had served continuously\nfor more than ten years, should be considered\nfor regularization as a one-time measure.\nHowever, the laudable intent of the judgment\nis being subverted when institutions rely on\nits dicta to indiscriminately reject the claims\nof employees, even in cases where their\n\n- 58 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nappointments are not illegal, but merely lack\nadherence to procedural formalities.\nGovernment departments often cite the\njudgment in\nUma Devi\n(supra) to argue that\nno vested right to regularization exists for\ntemporary employees, overlooking the\njudgment's explicit acknowledgment of cases\nwhere regularization is appropriate. This\nselective application distorts the judgment's\nspirit and purpose, effectively weaponizing it\nagainst employees who have rendered\nindispensable services over decades.\n\n27. In light of these considerations, in our\nopinion, it is imperative for government\ndepartments to lead by example in providing fair\nand stable employment. Engaging workers on a\ntemporary basis for extended periods, especially\nwhen their roles are integral to the organization's\nfunctioning, not only contravenes international\nlabour standards but also exposes the organization\nto legal challenges and undermines employee\nmorale. By ensuring fair employment practices,\ngovernment institutions can reduce the burden of\nunnecessary litigation, promote job security, and\nuphold the principles of justice and fairness that\nthey are meant to embody. This approach aligns\nwith international standards and sets a positive\nprecedent for the private sector to follow, thereby\ncontributing to the overall betterment of labour\npractices in the country.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nAgain, the Apex Court in the case of\nSHRIPAL v. NAGAR\nNIGAM8\n, has held as follows:\n\n\"3. The factual matrix leading up to the\nappeal before us is as follows:\n\n3.1. The Appellant Workmen claim to have\nbeen engaged as Gardeners (Malis) in the\nHorticulture Department of the Respondent\nEmployer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam, since the year\n2025 SCC OnLine SC 221\n\n- 59 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n1998 (in some instances, since 1999). According to\nthem, they continuously discharged horticultural\nand maintenance duties-- such as planting trees,\nmaintaining parks, and beautifying public spaces--\nunder the direct supervision of the Respondent\nEmployer. They further allege that no formal\nappointment letters were ever issued to them, and\nthat they were persistently denied minimum wages,\nweekly offs, national holidays, and other statutory\nbenefits.\n\n3.2. In 2004, the Appellant Workmen, along\nwith many other similarly situated employees,\nraised an industrial dispute (C.B. Case No. 6 of\n2004) before the Conciliation Officer at Ghaziabad,\nseeking regularization of their services and the\nrequisite statutory benefits. They contend that,\nupon learning of this demand, the Respondent\nEmployer began delaying their salaries and\nsubjected them to adverse working conditions.\nEventually, around mid-July 2005, the services of\nnumerous workmen were allegedly terminated\norally, without any notice, written orders, or\nretrenchment compensation.\n\n3.3. Since the above termination took place\nduring the pendency of the conciliation\nproceedings, the Appellant Workmen argue it\nviolated\nSection 6E\nof the U.P. Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947. Consequently, the State Government\nreferred the disputes concerning both (i)\nregularization and (ii) legality of the alleged\ntermination, to the Labour Court, Ghaziabad for\nadjudication.\n\n3.4. The Labour Court proceeded to decide\nthe references vide two orders:\n\n(i) Order dated 03.06.2011 : In numerous\nadjudication cases (e.g., Adjudication Case\nNos. 448, 451, 467 of 2006, etc.), the\nLabour Court passed awards holding the\nterminations illegal for want of compliance\nwith Section 6N of the U.P. Industrial\n\n- 60 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nDisputes Act, 1947, and directed\nreinstatement with 30% back wages.\n\n(ii) Order dated 11.10.2011 : However, in about\n41 other adjudication cases (e.g.,\nAdjudication Case Nos. 269, 270, 272, etc.),\nthe Labour Court arrived at a contrary\nconclusion, dismissing the claims on the\nfinding that the concerned workmen had not\nbeen engaged directly by the Nagar Nigam\nbut rather through a contractor, and hence\nhad no enforceable right to reinstatement or\nregularization against the Respondent\nEmployer.\n\n3.5. Aggrieved by the adverse portion of the\nawards (i.e., those granting reinstatement), the\nRespondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam,\nfiled several writ petitions before the High Court of\nJudicature at Allahabad, challenging the Labour\nCourt's findings. On the other hand, the workmen\nwhose claims were dismissed by the other set of\nawards also approached the High Court by filing\ntheir own writ petitions. All these writ petitions\nwere heard together, culminating in the common\njudgment dated 01.03.2019, which partly modified\nthe Labour Court's conclusions.\n\n3.6. Through the impugned judgment,\nthe High Court held that while the Labour\nCourt was correct in exercising jurisdiction\nunder the\nU.P. Industrial Disputes Act\n(since\nmunicipalities could be treated as \"industry\"),\nthere remained factual complexities as to\nwhether the workmen were genuinely on the\nrolls of the Nagar Nigam or were provided by\ncontractors. The High Court also noted that\nthe State Government had, by\nnotifications/orders, placed a ban on fresh\nrecruitments in Municipal Corporations,\nthereby restricting direct appointments to any\npost. Ultimately, the High Court partially\nmodified the relief granted, directing re-\nengagement of the workmen on daily wages,\nwith pay equivalent to the minimum in the\n\n- 61 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nregular pay scale of Gardeners, while allowing\nfuture consideration of their regularization if\npermissible by law.\n\n4. Both the Appellant Workmen and the\nRespondent Employer have now approached this\nCourt by way of Special Leave Petitions. The\nworkmen primarily seek full reinstatement with\nback wages and a direction to secure their\nregularization, whereas the Respondent Employer\nseeks to quash the modifications ordered by the\nHigh Court on the ground that the High Court\nexceeded its jurisdiction by granting partial relief\nakin to regular employees, contrary to\nconstitutional provisions and the State's ban on\nrecruitment.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the Appellant\nWorkmen made the following submissions:\n\nI. Continuous Service & Comparable Duties :\n\nThe Appellant Workmen had continuously\ndischarged horticultural and maintenance duties--\nlike planting trees, upkeep of public parks, and\ngeneral beautification--under the direct supervision\nand control of the Respondent Employer for periods\noften exceeding a decade. They insist such\nlongstanding, continuous work parallels that of\npermanent Gardeners.\n\nII. Direct Engagement & Wage Disbursement :\nThey aver that their wages, though inadequate,\nwere paid directly by the Horticulture Department\nof the Respondent Employer, nullifying the\nEmployer's claim of contractual hiring. Muster rolls\nand internal notes are cited to show direct\nemployer-employee relations.\n\nIII. Illegal Termination : Alleging violation of\n\nSections 6E\nand\n6N\nof the U.P. Industrial Disputes\nAct, 1947, the Appellant Workmen maintain their\nabrupt termination in July 2005 (during pendency\nof conciliation proceedings) was devoid of due\nprocess and statutory payments, rendering it\npatently illegal.\n\n- 62 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nIV. Entitlement to Reinstatement &\nRegularization : Given their long service and the\nprinciple of \"equal pay for equal work,\" the\nAppellant Workmen submit they deserve full\nreinstatement with back wages and a legitimate\npathway to regularization, as opposed to the partial\nrelief of mere daily-wage re-engagement\nprescribed by the High Court.\n\n6. On the other, the learned counsel for the\nRespondent Employer, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam\nmade the following submissions:\n\nI. Compliance with Constitutional Requirements :\n\nEmphasizing the constitutional scheme of public\nemployment, it is urged that there was (and\nremains) a ban on fresh recruitment in Municipal\nCorporations, and no proper selection process was\never followed to appoint the Workmen on any\nsanctioned posts.\n\nII. No Direct Employer-Employee Relationship :\nThe Respondent Employer contends that all\nhorticulture work was carried out through\nindependent contractors appointed via tender\nprocesses. It claims any partial wage\ndocumentation cited by the Workmen fails to\nestablish direct engagement.\n\nIII.\nInapplicability of Regularization : Relying\non\nSecretary, State of Karnataka v. Umadevi1\n, it is\nasserted that no daily wager can claim permanent\nabsorption without adherence to constitutional\nrequirements and availability of duly sanctioned\nvacancies.\n\nIV. Inadequate Proof of 240 Days' Service : The\nRespondent Employer points out that the Workmen\ndid not convincingly demonstrate they completed\n240 days of continuous work in any calendar year,\nthus undermining the assertion that their cessation\nfrom service was illegal.\n\n- 63 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nV. Challenge to Modified Relief: Finally, it argues\nthat the High Court's direction to pay minimum-\nscale wages and to consider the Workmen for\nfuture regularization oversteps legal boundaries,\ndisregards the recruitment ban, and fosters an\nimpermissible avenue of public employment. The\nRespondent Employer, therefore, seeks the\nquashing of the impugned judgment.\n\n7. Having heard the arguments and\nsubmissions of the learned counsel for the parties\nand having perused the record, this Court is of the\nconsidered opinion that the nature of engagement\nof the Appellant Workmen, the admitted shortage\nof Gardeners, and the circumstances under which\ntheir services were brought to an end, merit closer\nscrutiny.\n\n8. It is undisputed that, while the Appellant\nWorkmen were pressing for regularization and\nproper wages through pending conciliation\nproceedings, the Respondent Employer proceeded\nto discontinue their services, without issuing prior\nnotice or granting retrenchment compensation. At\nthis juncture, it is to have a look at the\nrequirements of\nSection 6E\nof the U.P. Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 which has been reproduced\nhereunder:--\n\n\"6E. [Conditions of service, etc. to\nremain unchanged in certain circumstances\nduring the pendency of proceedings.\n[Inserted by U.P. Act No. 1 of 1957.]\n\n(1) During the pendency of any conciliation\nproceeding before a Conciliation Officer or a\nBoard or of any proceeding before a Labour\nCourt or Tribunal in respect of an industrial\ndispute, no employer shall, -\n\n(a) in regard to any matter connected\nwith the dispute, alter, to the\nprejudice of the workmen concerned in\nsuch dispute, the conditions of service\napplicable to them immediately before\n\n- 64 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nthe commencement of such\nproceeding, or\n\n(b) for any misconduct connected with the\ndispute, discharge or punish, whether\nby dismissal or otherwise any\nworkman concerned in such dispute\nsave with the express permission in\nwriting of the authority before which\nthe proceeding is pending.\n\n(2) During the pendency of any such\nproceeding in respect of an industrial\ndispute, the employer may, in accordance\nwith the standing orders applicable to a\nworkman concerned in such dispute, -\n\n(a) alter, in regard to any matter not\nconnected with the dispute, the\nconditions of service applicable to that\nworkman immediately before the\ncommencement of such proceeding, or\n\n(b) for any misconduct not connected with\nthe dispute, discharge or punish,\nwhether by dismissal or otherwise:\n\nProvided that no such workman\nshall be discharged or dismissed,\nunless he has been paid wages for one\nmonth and an application has been\nmade by the employer to the authority\nbefore which the proceeding is\npending for approval of the action\ntaken by the employer.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in\nsub-section (2) no employer shall during the\npendency of any such proceeding in respect\nof an industrial dispute, take any action\nagainst any protected workman concerned in\nsuch dispute, -\n\n(a) by altering, to the prejudice of such\nprotected workman, the conditions of\n\n- 65 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nservice applicable to him immediately\nbefore the commencement of such\nproceeding, or\n\n(b) by discharging or punishing, whether\nby dismissal or otherwise, such\nprotected workman, such with the\nexpress permission in writing of the\nauthority before which the proceeding\nis pending. Explanation. - For the\npurposes of this sub-section, a\n'protected workman' in relation to an\nestablishment, means a workman\nwho, being an officer of a registered\ntrade union connected with the\nestablishment, is recognized as such\nin accordance with rules made in this\nbehalf.\n\n(4) In every establishment, the number of\nworkmen to be recognized as protected\nworkmen for the purposes of sub-section (3)\nshall not exceed one per cent of the total\nnumber of workmen employed therein\nsubject to a minimum number of five\nprotected workmen and a maximum number\nof one hundred protected workmen and for\nthe aforesaid purpose, the State Government\nmay make rules providing for the distribution\nof such protected workmen among various\ntrade unions, if any, connected with the\nestablishment and the manner in which they\nmay be chosen and recognized as protected\nworkmen.\n\n(5) Where an employer makes an\napplication to a Board, Labour Court or\nTribunal under the proviso to sub-section (2)\nfor approval of the action taken by him, the\nauthority concerned shall, without delay,\nhear such application and pass, as\nexpeditiously as possible, such order in\nrelation thereto as it deems fit.\"\n\n- 66 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\n9. On a plain reading of this section, we\ncan deduce that any unilateral alteration in\nservice conditions, including termination, is\nimpermissible during the pendency of such\nproceedings unless prior approval is obtained\nfrom the appropriate authority. The record in\nthe present case does not indicate that the\nRespondent Employer ever sought or was\ngranted the requisite approval. Prima facie,\ntherefore, this conduct reflects a deliberate\nattempt to circumvent the lawful claims of the\nworkmen, particularly when their dispute over\nregularization and wages remained sub\njudice.\n\n10. The Respondent Employer consistently\nlabelled the Appellant Workmen as casual\nemployees (or workers engaged through an\nunnamed contractor), yet there is no material proof\nof adherence to\nSection 6N\nof the U.P. Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947, which mandates a proper\nnotice or wages in lieu thereof as well as\nretrenchment compensation. In this context,\nwhether an individual is classified as regular or\ntemporary is irrelevant as retrenchment obligations\nunder the Act must be met in all cases attracting\nSection 6N. Any termination thus effected without\nstatutory safeguards cannot be undertaken lightly.\n\n11. xxxx\n\n12. xxxx\n\n13. xxxx\n\n14. The Respondent Employer places\nreliance on\nUmadevi\n(supra)2 to contend that\ndaily-wage or temporary employees cannot\nclaim permanent absorption in the absence of\nstatutory rules providing such absorption.\nHowever, as frequently reiterated, Uma\nDevi itself distinguishes between\nappointments that are \"illegal\" and those that\nare \"irregular,\" the latter being eligible for\nregularization if they meet certain conditions.\n\n- 67 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nMore importantly, Uma Devi cannot serve as a\nshield to justify exploitative engagements\npersisting for years without the Employer\nundertaking legitimate recruitment. Given the\nrecord which shows no true contractor-based\narrangement and a consistent need for\npermanent horticultural staff the alleged\nasserted ban on fresh recruitment, though\nreal, cannot justify indefinite daily-wage\nstatus or continued unfair practices.\n\n15. It is manifest that the Appellant\nWorkmen continuously rendered their\nservices over several years, sometimes\nspanning more than a decade. Even if certain\nmuster rolls were not produced in full, the\nEmployer's failure to furnish such records--\ndespite directions to do so--allows an adverse\ninference under well-established labour\njurisprudence. Indian labour law strongly\ndisfavors perpetual daily-wage or contractual\nengagements in circumstances where the\nwork is permanent in nature. Morally and\nlegally, workers who fulfil ongoing municipal\nrequirements year after year cannot be\ndismissed summarily as dispensable,\nparticularly in the absence of a genuine\ncontractor agreement. At this juncture, it\nwould be appropriate to recall the broader\ncritique of indefinite \"temporary\" employment\npractices as done by a recent judgment of this\ncourt in Jaggo v. Union of India3 in the following\nparagraphs:\n\n\"xxxxxxxxx\"\n\n16. xxx\n\n17. xxx\n\n18. The impugned order of the High Court,\nto the extent they confine the Appellant Workmen\nto future daily-wage engagement without continuity\nor meaningful back wages, is hereby set aside with\nthe following directions:\n\n- 68 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nI. The discontinuation of the Appellant\nWorkmen's services, effected without\ncompliance with Section 6E and\nSection 6N\n\nof the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, is\ndeclared illegal. All orders or communications\nterminating their services are quashed. In\nconsequence, the Appellant Workmen shall\nbe treated as continuing in service from the\ndate of their termination, for all purposes,\nincluding seniority and continuity in service.\n\nII. The Respondent Employer shall reinstate the\nAppellant Workmen in their respective posts\n(or posts akin to the duties they previously\nperformed) within four weeks from the date\nof this judgment. Their entire period of\nabsence (from the date of termination until\nactual reinstatement) shall be counted for\ncontinuity of service and all consequential\nbenefits, such as seniority and eligibility for\npromotions, if any.\n\nIII. Considering the length of service, the\nAppellant Workmen shall be entitled to\n50% of the back wages from the date of\ntheir discontinuation until their actual\nreinstatement. The Respondent\nEmployer shall clear the aforesaid dues\nwithin three months from the date of\ntheir reinstatement.\n\nIV. The Respondent Employer is directed to\ninitiate a fair and transparent process\nfor regularizing the Appellant Workmen\nwithin six months from the date of\nreinstatement, duly considering the fact\nthat they have performed perennial\nmunicipal duties akin to permanent\nposts. In assessing regularization, the\nEmployer shall not impose educational\nor procedural criteria retroactively if\nsuch requirements were never applied\nto the Appellant Workmen or to similarly\nsituated regular employees in the past.\n\n- 69 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nTo the extent that sanctioned vacancies\nfor such duties exist or are required, the\nRespondent Employer shall expedite all\nnecessary administrative processes to\nensure these long-time employees are\nnot indefinitely retained on daily wages\ncontrary to statutory and equitable\nnorms.\n\n19. In view of the above, the appeal(s) filed\nby the workmen are allowed, whereas the\nappeal(s) filed by the Nagar Nigam Ghaziabad are\ndismissed.\"\n\n(Emphasis supplied)\n\nOn a coalesce of the judgments rendered by the\nApex Court in the afore-quoted cases, which were in the\naftermath of the judgment in the case of\nUMADEVI (3\n)\nsupra, would in unmistakable terms indicate that\nregularization of employees is not a concept that is\nobliterated, but could be considered on several\nparameters\nlaid down in\nthe said judgments. One\nunmistakable stream that runs through judicial thinking of\njudgments of the Apex Court is that, regularization of the\nservices of the employees engaged to work for the State\nfor long years should be considered, failing which, it\nwould amount to violation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution\nof India.\"\n\n15. In the light of the issue standing covered by the\n\njudgments quoted supra, the petition deserves to succeed with\n\nthe direction to respondent No.2 to consider the case of these\n\npetitioners for regularization of their services from the date on\n\nwhich they completed 10 years from the date of their initial\n\nappointment. It is further germane to notice the Subsequent\n\njudgment of the Apex Court in the case of DHARAM SINGH\n\n- 70 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nAND OTHERS VS. STATE OF U.P. AND ANOTHER9, wherein\n\nthe Apex Court has held as follows:\n\n\"8. Moreover, it must necessarily be noted that\n\"ad-hocism\" thrives where administration is opaque. The\nState Departments must keep and produce accurate\nestablishment registers, muster rolls and outsourcing\narrangements, and they must explain, with evidence, why\nthey prefer precarious engagement over sanctioned posts\nwhere the work is perennial. If \"constraint\" is invoked, the\nrecord should show what alternatives were considered,\nwhy similarly placed workers were treated differently, and\nhow the chosen course aligns with\n\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\nSensitivity to the human consequences of prolonged\ninsecurity is not sentimentality. It is a constitutional\ndiscipline that should inform every decision affecting\nthose who keep public offices running.\n\n19. Having regard to the long, undisputed service\nof the appellants, the admitted perennial nature of their\nduties, and the material indicating vacancies and\ncomparator regularisations, we issue the following\ndirections:\n\ni. Regularization and creation of\nSupernumerary posts: All appellants shall\nstand regularized with effect from\n24.04.2002, the date on which the High\nCourt directed a fresh recommendation by\nthe Commission and a fresh decision by the\nState on sanctioning posts for the appellants.\n\nFor this purpose, the State and the successor\nestablishment (U.P. Education Services\nSelection Commission) shall create\nsupernumerary posts in the corresponding\ncadres, Class-III (Driver or equivalent) and\nClass-IV (Peon/Attendant/Guard or\nequivalent) without any caveats or\npreconditions. On regularization, each\nappellant shall be placed at not less than the\nminimum of the regular pay-scale for the\n2025 SCC OnLine SC 1735\n\n- 71 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\npost, with protection of last-drawn wages if\nhigher and the appellants shall be entitled to\nthe subsequent increments in the pay scale\nas per the pay grade. For seniority and\npromotion, service shall count from the date\nof regularization as given above.\n\nii. Financial consequences and\narrears: Each appellant shall be paid as\narrears the full difference between (a) the\npay and admissible allowances at the\nminimum of the regular pay-level for the post\nfrom time to time, and (b) the amounts\nactually paid, for the period from 24.04.2002\nuntil the date of\nregularization/retirement/death, as the case\nmay be. Amounts already paid under\nprevious interim directions shall be so\nadjusted. The net arrears shall be released\nwithin three months and if in default, the\nunpaid amount shall carry compound interest\nat 6% per annum from the date of default\nuntil payment.\n\niii. Retired appellants: Any appellant who has\nalready retired shall be granted regularization\nwith effect from 24.04.2002 until the date of\nsuperannuation for pay fixation, arrears\nunder clause (ii), and recalculation of\npension, gratuity and other terminal dues.\nThe revised pension and terminal dues shall\nbe paid within three months of this\nJudgment.\n\niv. Deceased appellants: In the case of\nAppellant No. 5 and any other appellant who\nhas died during pendency, his/her legal\nrepresentatives on record shall be paid the\narrears under clause (ii) up to the date of\ndeath, together with all terminal/retiral dues\nrecalculated consistently with clause (i),\nwithin three months of this Judgment.\n\nv. Compliance affidavit: The Principal\nSecretary, Higher Education Department,\nGovernment of Uttar Pradesh, or the\n\n- 72 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nSecretary of the U.P. Education Services\nSelection Commission or the prevalent\ncompetent authority, shall file an affidavit of\ncompliance before this Court within four\nmonths of this Judgment.\n\n20. We have framed these directions\ncomprehensively because, case after case, orders of this\nCourt in such matters have been met with fresh\ntechnicalities, rolling \"reconsiderations,\" and\nadministrative drift which further prolongs the insecurity\nfor those who have already laboured for years on daily\nwages. Therefore, we have learned that Justice in such\ncases cannot rest on simpliciter directions, but it demands\nimposition of clear duties, fixed timelines, and verifiable\ncompliance. As a constitutional employer, the State is\nheld to a higher standard and therefore it must organise\nits perennial workers on a sanctioned footing, create a\nbudget for lawful engagement, and implement judicial\ndirections in letter and spirit. Delay to follow these\nobligations is not mere negligence but rather it is a\nconscious method of denial that erodes livelihoods and\ndignity for these workers. The operative scheme we have\nset here comprising of creation of supernumerary posts,\nfull regularization, subsequent financial benefits, and a\nsworn affidavit of compliance, is therefore a pathway\ndesigned to convert rights into outcomes and to reaffirm\nthat fairness in engagement and transparency in\nadministration are not matters of grace, but obligations\nunder\nArticles 14\n, 16\nand\nof the Constitution of India\"\n\n16. The Apex Court holds that keeping the persons in\n\ncontinuous ad hoc employment would itself become arbitrary and\n\nviolative of the\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. In that\n\nlight, the direction would ensue to the respondents to consider\n\nthe case of these petitioners to regularise their services.\n\n17. For the aforesaid reasons, the following:\n\n- 73 -\n\nNC: 2025:KHC-D:13897\n\nWP No. 105364 of 2025\n\nC/W WP No. 105664 of 2025\n\nHC-KAR\n\nORDER\n\n(i) The petitions are allowed.\n\n(ii) The impugned order issued by respondent No.2,\ndated 04.08.2022, vide Annexure-J, and the\nimpugned endorsements issued by respondent\nNo.3 dated 12.09.2022 23.07.2024 vide\nAnnexure-K and Anneuxre-M respectively stand\nquashed in W.P.
