He found that said deceased Keshav was cleaning\n\nthe car of its owner at about 1:00 p.m. on the ill-fated day. After cleaning\n\nthe car, he put it in reverse gear and after taking turn, the car hit the\n\nflower pots, which were kept in front of the house of the petitioner and\n\n 1 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:17 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 2\n\nthose were broken.\n\n It is further alleged that thereafter, the owner of the house\n\nknown as Kher came out of the house and took out Keshav deceased from\n\nthe car and threaten him and gave him him blows and used abusive\n\nlanguage against him. The petitioner also demanded price of the broken\n\nflower pots. It is further alleged that the petitioner caught hold of the\n\ndeceased from his hair who fell on the ground and all this was witnessed\n\nby the above said Deepak Malhotra. He tried to pacify the petitioner but\n\nthe petitioner also used bad words qua him and also threatened Deepak\n\nMalhotra .\n\n Thereafter, Keshav deceased went to his room and at about\n\n3:00 p.m. it was found that he was hanging and committed suicide. On his\n\nstatement, FIR was registered.\n\n After completion of investigation, the challan was submitted\n\nbefore the Area Magistrate .\n\n I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through\n\nthe record.\n\n Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the\n\npetitioner and the deceased were known to each other; as per allegations\n\nin the FIR, the deceased hit the car in the house of the petitioner, due to\n\nwhich, it caused damage to the flower pots and the petitioner demanded\n\nprice of the broken flower pots. It was tortuous act of the deceased and\n\ndue to this reason, there was an altercation between the petitioner and the\n\ninformant. There is no proximate nexus between the act of the deceased\n\nand commission of suicide and the petitioner has been falsely implicated\n\n 2 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 3\n\non behalf of his neighbour Deepak Malhotra.\n\n It has been further argued that in fact the deceased\n\ncommitted suicide due to the conduct of his owner Shri Deepak Malhotra\n\nbut in order to save his skin, the informant has projected a false story and\n\ngot lodged the FIR against the petitioner from one Mr. Bishan Kumar\n\nwho is the relative of the deceased.\n\n It has been further argued that in fact on 17.1.2016, i.e., the\n\nill-fated day, the petitioner had gone to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib Ji, New\n\nDelhi and distributed langer to the first batch and he saw one Nepali\n\ndomestic help in front of his house in his car, who was in the process of\n\ndriving back the car in front portion of the house of the petitioner, as a\n\nresult of which, four flower pots placed outside the house were totally\n\nsmudged and the petitioner reprimanded him and went inside his house.\n\nEven the petitioner was not known about the incident.\n\n It has been further argued that there was absolutely neither\n\nany intention nor mens rea with regard to reprimanding the deceased and\n\nfrom a bare perusal of the material available on the record, no offence is\n\nmade out with regard to abetment to suicide and there is absolutely no\n\nnexus between the acts of the petitioner and the suicide by the deceased.\n\nAccording to him, prima facie, no case is made out against the petitioner\n\nto face trial for offence under \nSection 306\n of Indian Penal Code. \nIn\n\nsupport of his contentions, he placed reliance on the judgments of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in \nMadan Mohan Singh v. State of Gujarat &\n\nanr\n; 2010 (\n8) SCC 628, M. Mohan v. State Tr. Dy. Supdt. Of Police\n;\n\n2011 (3) SCC 626, Ramesh Kumar v.

State of Haryana and another\n decided on\n\n22.5.2018.\n\n On the other hand, learned State counsel has vehemently\n\ncontended that the petitioner not only reprimanded the deceased but also\n\nabused him, given blows and demanded the price of dismantled flower\n\npots and the acts, omission and commission of the petitioner amounts to\n\ninstigation.\n\n This Court has given its thoughtful consideration to the rival\n\ncontentions.\n\n The suicide is as old as civilization itself. It is self murder or\n\nself destruction or self killing and it is done in many ways in which life\n\nitself can be destroyed. The reasons for the same are also numberless.\n\nNow-a-days, most of unfortunate deaths of persons occur due to the\n\ntrivial matters, such as road-rage incidents, undue anguish and even street\n\nquarrels.\n\n \nSection 306\n of the Indian penal code penalises abetment of\n\nsuicide. \nSection 306\n prescribes punishment for \"abetment of suicide\"\n\nwhile \nsection 309\n punishes attempt to commit suicide. Abetment of\n\nattempt to commit suicide is outside the preview of \nsection 306\n and it is\n\npunishable only under 309 read with \nsection 107\n of IPC. Thus even\n\nwhere the punishment for attempt to commit suicide is not considered\n\ndesirable, its abetment is made a penal offence. \nSection 306\n of the Indian\n\nPenal Code penalises abetment of suicide.\n\n 4 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 5\n\nSection 306\n reads as : Abetment of suicide - If any person\n\ncommits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide, shall be\n\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term not\n\nexceeding ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\n\n For conviction under this section, the prosecution has to\n\nprove that :\n\n 1. The deceased committed suicide,\n\n 2. The accused instigated or abetted for committing suicide,\n\n and\n\n 3. Mens-Rea of the accused.\n\n ABETMENT is an offence as defined under \nsection 107\n of\n\nIndian Penal Code, 1860. Abetment in its literal sense means,\n\nthe instigation of a person to do (or not to do) an act in a certain way, or\n\naid given by some person to another either of his own accord or under the\n\nprovisions governing joint and constructive liability. Abetment involves a\n\nmental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in\n\ndoing of a thing.\n\n Abetment of suicide involves a mental process of instigating\n\na person or intentionally aiding a person in committing suicide. Without a\n\npositive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing\n\nsuicide, conviction cannot be sustained.\n\n The intention of the legislature is very much clear that in\n\norder to convict a person under \nsection 306\n IPC, there has to be a clear\n\nmens-rea to commit the offence. It also requires an active act or a direct\n\nact which led the deceased to commit suicide seeing no option and that\n\n 5 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 6\n\nact must have been intended to push the deceased into such a position\n\nthat he committed suicide. No straight jacket formula can be laid down to\n\nfind out as to whether in a particular case there has been instigation,\n\nwhich forced the person to commit suicide. In a particular case, there may\n\nnot be direct evidence in regard to instigation, which may have direct\n\nrelationship between \nsection 306\n and \nSection 107\n. Therefore, in such a\n\ncase, an inference has to be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be\n\ndetermined whether circumstances had been such, which in fact had\n\ncreated the situation that person committed suicide. In order to convict a\n\nperson under \nsection 306\n, IPC, there has to be a clear mens-rea to commit\n\nthe offence. It also requires an active act or direct act which led the\n\ndeceased to commit suicide seeing no option and this act must have been\n\nintended to push the deceased into such a position that he committed\n\nsuicide.\n\n In the case in hand, it is undisputed that the petitioner had no\n\nprior enmity either with the deceased (who was a domestic help with\n\nDeepak Malhotra) or his master.\n\n On a bare perusal of the material available on the record, it\n\ntranspires that it was a street quarrel between the deceased and the\n\npetitioner, which erupted due to the tortuous act of the deceased. The\n\ndeceased appeared to be a minor. Probably he was not having any driving\n\nlicence and it seems that he did not know driving. He drove the car in\n\nreverse motion which hit some part of the house of the petitioner and\n\ndismantled some flower pots belonging to the petitioner.\n\n 6 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 7\n\n It is alleged that the petitioner abused him, reprimanded him\n\nand demanded price of the dismantled flower pots.\n\n If we go through the entire incident, then the main ingredient\n\nof the offence of abetment i.e. mens rea is missing. A person aggrieved\n\nby the tortuous act of the wrong-doer can claim and demand\n\ncompensation of the wrong done to his property. If he demands so and\n\nthe wrong door commits suicide, it does not amount to abetment to\n\nsuicide. Similarly, use of abusive language alone without any mens rea\n\ndoes not amount to abetment to suicide.\n\n \nIn \nP. Sreenivasulu v. State of A.P.\n; 2004 Criminal Law\n\nJournal 2718, when there was a dying declaration of the deceased that the\n\naccused abused her and she committed suicide,it has been observed in\n\npara 14 as under : -\n\n \"14. I am of the considered view that abuses cannot amount\n\n to abetment, unless something more is done in pursuance of\n\n the said act of abuses. I am also of the consider view that the\n\n present case does not fall under \nSection 306\n, I.P.C. as there\n\n is no abetment to commit suicide. In fact no charge has been\n\n framed and the accused was not made aware of the offence\n\n for which he was tried. It is the duty of the Court to make the\n\n accused aware of the offence for which he is being tried, lest\n\n it may cause prejudice to the accused. If the Court below\n\n feels that the case had been made out under \nSection 306\n,\n\n I.P.C. it ought to have framed a charge under \nSection 306\n,\n\n I.P.C. and recorded the plea of the accused and then\n\n 7 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 8\n\n proceeded with further trial, instead of giving punishment\n\n directly for the offence under \nSection 306\n, I.P.C. More so,\n\n during the course of 313, Cr. P. C. examination the accused\n\n was not questioned regarding the alleged offence under\n\n \nSection 306\n, I.P.C. which caused prejudice to the accused. In\n\n this case P.Ws. 1 to 3 state that it is a stove accident. The\n\n dying declaration recorded by the Magistrate shows that\n\n because of the abuses of the accused, she committed suicide\n\n by pouring kerosene over herself and setting fire. In fact\n\n there is no abetment to commit suicide. I am of the\n\n considered opinion that uttering of abuses will not amount to\n\n provocation to commit suicide and it does not constitute\n\n abetment. It is contended that after the police have given the\n\n requisition to record dying declaration, the case was\n\n registered. Hence, there is every possibility of anti-dating\n\n F.I.R. In my opinion, no offence is made out under\n\n \nSection 306\n, I.P.C. and there is no need to advert to\n\n investigation aspect, as it loses much of its importance.\n\n The instigation is a part of abetment but instigation requires\n\nthe mental element of intention as well as mens rea.\n\n The term instigation under \nsection 107\n IPC has been\n\nexplained in Chitresh Kumar Chopra v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi,\n\n2009(4) R.C.R.(Criminal) 196 : (2009) 16 SCC 605: (2010) 3 SCC\n\n(Crl.) 367) as follows:\n\n 8 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 9\n\n \"16.

(as His Lordship then was) said that\n\n instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to\n\n do \"an act\". To satisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is\n\n not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what\n\n constitutes \"instigation\" must necessarily and specifically be\n\n suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite\n\n the consequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the\n\n accused had, by his acts or omission or by a continued course of\n\n conduct, created such circumstances that the deceased was left with\n\n no other option except to commit suicide, in which case, an\n\n \"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit of\n\n anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually\n\n follow, cannot be said to be instigation.\n\n 17. Thus, to constitute \"instigation\", a person who instigates\n\n another has to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the doing of an\n\n act by the other by \"goading\" or \"urging forward\". The dictionary\n\n meaning of the word \"goad\" is \"a thing that stimulates someone\n\n into action; provoke to action or reaction\" (see Concise Oxford\n\n English Dictionary); \"to keep irritating or annoying somebody until\n\n he reacts\" (see Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Edn.).\"\n\n Words uttered in a fit of anger or omission without any\n\nintention cannot be termed as instigation.\n\n \nIn \nRajesh v. State of Haryana\n; 2019 (1) RCR (Criminal)\n\n 9 of 16\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 26-08-2019 00:28:18 :::\n\n CRM-M-8661-2016 10\n\n847, it has been observed in para 8 as under : -\n\n \"8. Conviction under \nsection 306\n IPC is not sustainable on\n\n the allegation of harassment without there being any positive\n\n action proximate to the time of occurrence on the part of the\n\n accused, which led or compelled the person to commit\n\n suicide. In order to bring a case within the purview of\n\n \nsection 306\n IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in the\n\n commission of the said offence, the person who is said to\n\n have abetted the commission of suicide must have played an\n\n active role by an act of instigation or by doing certain act to\n\n facilitate the commission of suicide. Therefore, the act of\n\n abetment by the person charged with the said offence must\n\n be proved and established by the prosecution before he could\n\n be convicted under \nsection 306\n IPC.\"\n\n \nIn \nGurcharan Singh v.

Orilal Jaiswal\n, 1994(3) R.C.R.\n\n (Criminal) 186 : (1994) 1 SCC 73, this Court has\n\n observed that the courts should be extremely careful\n\n in assessing the facts and circumstances of each case\n\n and the evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose\n\n of finding whether the cruelty meted out to the victim\n\n had in fact induced her to end the life by committing\n\n suicide.
