No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nName of counsels for parties For the Petitioners: Shri Ajeet Singh,\nAdvocate.\n\nFor the respondents: Shri Mukesh\nKumar Agrawal, Shri Anoop Nair, Shri\nVed Prakash Tiwari, Shri A.P. Shroti,\nShri Rohit Jain with Shri Mohd.\nSiddiqui, Advocates.\nLaw laid down\n\nSignificant paragraph\nnumbers\n\nORDER\n\n(03.04.2019)\n\nThese matters were analogously heard on the joint request of the parties.\n\nThe facts are taken from WP No.18718/2017.\n\n2. The petitioner was initially appointed as Junior Engineer in Gramin\n\nVidyut Sahkari Samiti, Rewa on 23.9.1986 (Annexure P/5). The State\n\nGovernment has taken a decision regarding abolition of Gramin Vidyut\n\nSahkari Samiti and consequently the services of the petitioner were\n\nmereged with the M.P. State Electricity Board (MPSEB) by order dated\n\n18.5.2004 (Annexure P/6) with effect from 15.3.2002. The petitioner has\n\nprayed for following reliefs in this petition:\n\n\"(i) It is, therefore, prayed that this Hon'ble Court may kindly\nbe pleased to quash the impugned orders dated 15.12.2014\n(Annexure P/1), order dated 09-10-15 (Annexure P-2), order\ndated 27-07-2015 (Annexure P-3) and other dated 25-03-17\n(Annexure P-4) and the respondents be directed to give the\nbenefits of third higher pay scale to the petitioner by counting his\nprevious service from the date of his entitlement in terms of order\ndated 04-01-2016 with all service benefits including arrears.\n\n(ii) Respondents be further directed to give the benefits of\nRevision of Pay Regulation, 2001 as well as benefits of 6th Pay\nCommission w.e.f. 01-01-2006 by modifying the pay fixation\ndated 11-02-15 with arrears and merge the EPF account into the\nGPF account w.e.f. 15-03-2002 and give the benefit of pension at\npar with the original employees of MPEB by counting his\nprevious service.\n\n13 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\n(iii) This Hon'ble Court be further pleased to pass any such\nother orders as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit under the\ncircumstances of the case.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n3. Shri Ajeet Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that in\n\nthese petitions, the petitioners are similarly situated and have prayed for\n\nsimilar reliefs. If any other uncommon relief is involved in any matter, such\n\npetitioners may be permitted to raise the same in separate fresh petition/s.\n\n4. To elaborate, Shri Ajeet Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nsubmits that petitioner in the instant case was absorbed with effect from\n\n15.3.2002. The respondents have passed the impugned order dated\n\n15.12.2014 (Annexure P/1) whereby it was directed that services of the\n\nabsorbed employees shall be counted from the date of absorption for the\n\npurposes of grant of higher pay-scale whereas respondents should have\n\ncounted the services rendered by the absorbed employees in erstwhile\n\nsocieties for the purposes of counting their eligibility for grant of higher\n\npay-scale. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that para 4 of this\n\norder dated 15.12.2014 makes it clear that such absorbed employees shall\n\nget benefit of certain allowances and medical benefits etc. from the date of\n\nissuance of order i.e. 15.12.2014 whereas they were entitled to get the\n\nbenefits from the date of absorption. The very same document dated\n\n15.12.2014 was subject matter of challenge before this Court in WP\n\nNo.3547/2015 (\nUma Shankar Dwivedi vs. State of M.P. and others\n)\n\ndecided on 06.10.2015. This Court by order dated 16.10.2015 has set aside\n\nthe same order dated 15.12.2014. The employer assailed it before the Apex\n\nCourt in Civil Appeal No.9146-9148/2018. The Apex Court with little\n14 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nmodification mentioned in para 4 of the order which is related with Pay\n\nRevision Regulations, 2001 did not disturb the remaining part of order\n\npassed by this Court. Thus, for all practical purposes, the impugned order\n\ndated 15.12.2014 except the modification mentioned herein above had\n\nattained finality. In the teeth of this order, it is no more open to the\n\nrespondents to deprive the petitioners from fruits of medical benefits and\n\nother allowances from the date of absorption. Putting it differently, it is\n\nargued that petitioners are entitled to get these benefits from the date of\n\ntheir absorption.\n\n5. Further more, it is urged that clause 6 of this order dated 15.12.2014\n\nmust also be treated as set aside in view of order passed by this Court in the\n\ncase of\nUmashankar Dwivedi\n(Supra).\nShri Ajeet Singh by taking this\n\ncourt to the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Panchraj Tiwari vs.\n\nMPSEB reported in (2014) 5 SCC 101 contended that once service is\n\nmerged with another service, the merged service gets its birth in the\n\nintegrated service and loses its original identity. Thus, petitioners for all\n\npractical purposes became employees of the respondent-employer and their\n\norigin has lost its significance. Thus, petitioners are entitled to get the\n\nbenefit of revision of pay-scale and pension. It is argued that two revisions\n\nhave taken place in the past. The first revision is pursuant to 'M.P. State\n\nElectricity Board (Class III and Class IV Employees) Revision of Pay\n\nRegulations, 2001 ('Regulations'). Learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nsubmits that in clause 1(c)(vi), it was made clear that these Regulations\n\nwere not applicable to employees of the Societies who were absorbed in the\n\nBoard to whom the pre-revised pay-scales were not applicable. The\n15 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nRegulations came into being with effect from 1 st January, 2001. The\n\npetitioners who were absorbed subsequent thereto became employees of\n\nMPSEB from the date of their absorption. These Regulations and revised\n\npay-scales arising thereto should be made applicable on the petitioners.\n\n6. The second pay revision took place with effect from 01.01.2006. It\n\nis submitted that by order dated 18.08.2009 Annexure P/17, the revision of\n\npay-scale was made applicable to the absorbed employees. In clause 3(c),\n\nit was clarified that the arrears of revision of pay shall be payable to the\n\nabsorbed employees with effect from 01.08.2009 whereas, for the regular\n\nemployees of the MPEB, it was paid from due date i.e. 01.01.2006.\n\nLearned counsel submits that this issue also travelled before the Indore\n\nBench. By order of Indore Bench in WP No.1962/2010 decided on\n\n13.09.2011 (Annexure-P/17) the said action of employer was disapproved.\n\nThe employer unsuccessfully challenged the order of writ court before the\n\nDivision Bench in review jurisdiction. Thereafter, by communication dated\n\n14.1.2015 Annexure P/18, similarly situated absorbed employees, who\n\nwere petitioners before the Indore Bench, were given the benefit of revision\n\nof pay-scale and arrears with effect from 1.1.2006. The next contention of\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioners is for grant of pension. The basis for this\n\nargument is the same i.e. once petitioners became employees of\n\nrespondents-Electricity Board, there is no justification in not extending the\n\nsame pensionary benefits which were extended to the employees of\n\nM.P.S.E.B. Reliance is placed on the judgment of Indore Bench in WPS\n\nNo115/2005 (Bijli Karmachari Snagh vs. M.P.S.E.B.) decided on\n\n07.05.2015. Shri Singh urged that Writ Appeal and SLP(C)\n16 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nNo.24772/2016 filed against this judgment were dismissed. It is submitted\n\nthat in the light of this judgment, the benefits have already been extended\n\nin favour of the similarly situated employees.\n\n7. In nutshell, petitioners have prayed for counting their services\n\nrendered in erstwhile societies for the purposes of grant of time-scale of\n\npay and categorically pleaded in the prayer clause that this relief may be\n\ngranted in terms of the order dated 2.1.2016 (Annexure P/22). In addition,\n\nas noticed, the petitioners have prayed for grant of revision of pay as per\n\nRegulations of 2001 from the date of absorption, benefit of revision of pay\n\nas per 6th Pay Commission with effect from 1.1.2006 or from the date of the\n\nabsorption of the petitioners. The petitioners have prayed for a direction to\n\nmerge the EPF Account into GPF Account with effect 15.3.2002 and give\n\nthe benefit of pension at par with the original employees of M.P.S.E.B. by\n\ncounting their previous services.\n\n8. Shri Mukesh Kumar Agrawal, learned counsel for the employer\n\nsubmits that the event of absorption took place on two occasions. First\n\nabsorption is relating to eight societies namely: Multai, Manawar, Banda,\n\nPichor, Gohad and Mungawali. This merger had taken place by order dated\n\n18.05.2004 w.e.f 15.03.2002. Another merger had taken place on\n\n13.08.2010 relating to societies of Sidhi, Amarpatan, Loundi, and\n\nNowgaon.\n\n9. Shri Agrawal urged that the petitioners in these batch of petitions\n\nbecame employees of MPSEB pursuant to two different mergers. It is\n\nsubmitted that so far benefit of revision of pay-scale as per regulations of\n\n2001 is concerned, the Apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 9146-9148/2018\n17 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n's case clearly opined in para 4 that parity can be\n\nclaimed in limited cases.\n\n10. In the light of this para, Shri Agrawal submits that if petitioners are\n\nsimilarly situated then the matter is different. Otherwise, the order passed\n\nby Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of\nUma Shankar\n\nDwivedi\n(supra) WP No. 3547/2015 dated 06.10.2015 stood modified in\n\nview of para 4 of said order passed by Apex Court.\n\n11. Shri Agrawal urged that subject to fulfillment of conditions\n\nmentioned in para 4 of the judgment in\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n's case, the\n\nregulations of 2001 can be made applicable to the absorbed employee from\n\nthe date they became employees of respondent employer.\n\n12. So far benefit of 6th and 7th Pay Commission is concerned, in view of\n\npara 5 of judgment of Supreme Court in\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n(supra),\n\nShri M.K. Agrawal fairly admitted that the erstwhile employees of societies\n\nare entitled to get the benefit of such revision of pay-scale from the date\n\nthey became employees of the respondent/employer.\n\n13. Shri Agrawal submits that the petitioners were earlier governed by\n\ndifferent pension scheme/EPF scheme. The amount of contribution, method\n\nof collection, authority with whom amount was deposited, mode of\n\npayment of pension and its calculation, everything was different. They can\n\nswitch over to a different pension scheme only when law/rule permits. The\n\npetitioners have not filed any application praying to switch over from\n\nearlier scheme to the pension rules applicable to the MPSEB. In absence\n\nthereof, no relief is due to the petitioners.\n\n14. Shri Anoop Nair appeared in WP No. 934/2018 and urged that\n18 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\npetitioners are not entitled to get the benefit of pension as prayed for by\n\nthem.\n\n15. Shri J.K. Pillai, appeared in certain matters on behalf of P.F.\n\nOrganization. He urged that earlier when petitioners were employees of\n\nerstwhile societies, the employer use to deduct the employees contribution\n\nand add their own contribution and deposit it before the P.F. authorities.\n\nThe day petitioners became employees of present employer, the said\n\narrangement discontinued. The present employer is exempted from the\n\npurview of employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act\n\n1952. Present employer has created its own trust on which P.F.\n\nOrganization has no power of Superintendence. Thus a practical difficulty\n\nexists relating to switch over from one method/system of P.F. to another\n\nmethod governed by different set of rules.\n\n16. Shri Ved Prakash Tiwari appeared in WP No. 22379/2018 and\n\nborrowed the arguments advanced by the other counsel for the employer.\n\n17. Shri A.P. Shroti, learned counsel for the employer has filed written\n\nsubmissions. It is urged that M.P. Power Management Co. Ltd. is the\n\nholding company of all the Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) including\n\nthe answering respondent company and, therefore, the order dated\n\n15.12.2014 is applicable mutatis mutandis to all the companies. The\n\npetitioners have not challenged the order dated 18.06.2014 which had\n\nattained finality and in absence thereof, petitions deserve to be dismissed.\n\nThe petitioner - Praveen Kumar Tiwari filed W.P. Nos.10719/2014 and\n\n20284/2015 challenging inter alia the inaction to pay pension and order\n\ndated 15.12.2014. Although this pleading is not taken in the reply filed,\n19 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nsince it is self-evident, this Court can take notice of the same. A list of\n\ncases is prepared to show that the order dated 15.12.2014 has not been\n\nchallenged in those cases.\n\n18. Regarding claim for pension, GPF, higher pay scale and up-\n\ngradation, it is argued that in the case of Panchraj Tiwari (supra), the terms\n\nof absorption were reproduced by Supreme Court. In para 17 of the said\n\njudgment, it was made clear that although absorbed employees from the\n\ndate of absorption shall be treated as juniors to the juniormost employees\n\nof the Electricity Board, all other principal conditions of absorption shall\n\nremain as such. The petitioners/erstwhile employees of the society were\n\nmembers of EPF Scheme and, therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to\n\nget the benefit of GPF Scheme. Indore Bench order dated 07.05.2015\n\npassed sub silentio the order dated 18.06.2014 which was based on the law\n\nlaid down by the Apex Court in the case of Panchraj Tiwari (supra). This\n\njudgment did not consider Para 3.1 and 3.5 of judgment of Panchraj\n\nTiwari (supra) though it was referred in the said Indore Bench judgment.\n\nHence, said judgment cannot be treated as binding precedent regarding\n\nissue of pension and other conditions of absorption. It is stated that benefit\n\nof pay/higher pay scale was not available to the employees of the Rural\n\nElectricity Co-operative Society. After becoming employees of the\n\nMPSEB, they became entitled for up-gradation of pay on completion of\n\nnine years of service and were accordingly granted benefit of up-gradation.\n\n19. The stand of Shri Shroti regarding 5th and 6th Pay Commission\n\nbenefits is that as directed in Civil Appeal of M.P. P.K.V.V. Company Vs.\n\nUma Shankar Dwivedi, the cases are being decided by the answering\n20 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nrespondent society-wise and individual orders are being issued.\n\n20. No other point is pressed by learned counsel for the parties.\n\n21. I have bestowed my anxious consideration on the rival contentions\n\nand perused the record.\n\n22. As noticed, there is a chequered history of litigations for various\n\nclaims of erstwhile employees of societies who were absorbed in\n\nM.P.S.E.B. Before dealing with the claim point-wise, it is condign to refer\n\ncertain findings given by the Supreme Court. In Panchraj Tiwari (supra),\n\nthe Apex Court opined as under:\n\n\"6.3. Once a service is merged with another service, the merged\nservice gets its birth in the integrated service and loses its original\nidentity. There cannot be a situation, where even after merger,\nabsorption or integration, such services which were merged or\nabsorbed, still retain their original status. If so, it is not an\nabsorption or merger or integration, it will only be a working\narrangement without any functional integration.\n\n7. In the instant case, the undisputed factual and legal position is\nthat there is absorption of the employees of the Rural Electricity\nCooperative Society, Rewa with M.P. SEB. The Society has been\nderegistered, there is only one service thereafter and thus there is\nfunctional integration. On the basis of the protection of the\ndesignation and pay scale, the employees have to be posted in the\nequivalent category. Since it is not specifically provided as to the\nposition of such employees in the integrated service, it is a settled\nequitable principle that such employees are placed as junior to the\njuniormost officer of the category concerned in M.P. SEB on the\ndate of absorption viz. 15-3-2002.\n\n16. The instant is a case where there is complete denial of\npromotion forever which cannot be comprehended under the\nconstitutional scheme of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of\nIndia. In this context, we shall refer to a beautiful discussion on\nthis aspect in S.S. Bola case[(1997) 8 SCC 522] at para 153. The\nrelevant portion reads as follows: (SCC p. 634)\n\nAB. A distinction between right to be considered for promotion\nand an interest to be considered for promotion has always been\nmaintained. Seniority is a facet of interest. The rules prescribe\nthemethod of recruitment/selection. Seniority is governed by the\nrules existing as on the date of consideration for promotion.\nSeniority is required to be worked out according to the existing\nrules. No one has a vested right to promotion or seniority. But an\nofficer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the\nrules. The seniority should be taken away only by operation of\n21 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nvalid law. Right to be considered for promotion is a rule\nprescribed by conditions of service. A rule which affects chances\nof promotion of a person relates to conditions of service. The\nrule/provision in an Act merely affecting the chances of\npromotion [Ed.: The words between the two asterisks are\nemphasised in original.] would not be [Ed.: The words between\nthe two asterisks are emphasised in original.] regarded as\nvarying the conditions of service. The chances of promotion are\nnot conditions of service. A rule which merely affects the chances\nof promotion does not amount to change in the conditions of\nservice. However, once a declaration of law, on the basis of\nexisting rules, is made by a constitutional court and a mandamus\nis issued or direction given for its enforcement by preparing the\nseniority list, operation of the declaration of law and the\nmandamus and directions issued by the Court is the result of the\ndeclaration of law but not the operation of the rules per se.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n17. In the above circumstances, we set aside the judgment in\nappeal. The absorbed employees of the Rural Electricity\nCooperative Societies, having due regard to their date of\nappointment/promotion in each category in the respective\nsocieties, shall be placed with effect from the date of absorption\nviz. 15-3-2002 as juniors to the juniormost employee of the\nElectricity Board in the respective category. Thereafter, they shall\nbe considered for further promotions as per the rules/regulations\nof M.P. SEB. All other principles/conditions of absorption shall\nremain as such. However, it is made clear that on such\npromotions, in the exigencies of service, the employee concerned\nwould also be liable to be transferred out of the circle, if so\nrequired.\n\n18. The appellant accordingly shall be entitled to retrospective\npromotions on a par with and with effect from the dates on which\nthe juniormost graduate engineer in the parent service on the date\nof absorption obtained such promotions. However, we make it\nclear that benefits till date need to be worked out only notionally.\n\n23.\nIn\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n(supra), the Supreme Court in Para 4 has\n\nheld held as under:\n\n\"4. We make it clear that in case Appellant No.1 has extended the\nbenefit of the pay revision Regulations of 2001, despite the\nexclusion in the Notification dated 27.04.2006, to those\nemployees where the pre-revised pay scales had not been applied,\nthe respondent/employees belonging to the Rewa Society will not\nbe discriminated.\"\n\n24. Claim regarding benefit of Revision of Pay Regulations, 2001:\n\n(i) Shri Ajeet Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners by placing\n\nreliance on the judgment of this Court in\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n(supra)\n\nand judgment of Indore Bench in W.P. No.1962/2010 (Electricity Supply\n22 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nEmployees Union Vs. State of M.P\n.) stated that all the petitioners are\n\nentitled to get the benefit of pay scale arising out of Regulations of 2001\n\nfrom the date of their absorption. By order dated 14.01.2015 (Annexure-\n\nP/18), the order of the Indore Bench in W.P. No.1962/2010 has been\n\nimplemented and arrears arising thereto have been paid to the employees.\n\n(ii) Pausing here for a moment, the opening sentence of the order dated\n\n14.01.2015 (Annexure-P/18) shows that it relates to employees of\n\nManawar Society who were absorbed in M.P.S.E.B. Pertinently, before\n\nabsorption, in their parent society also they were getting the same pay scale\n\nwhich their counter-parts in M.P. S.E.B. were getting at the time of\n\nabsorption. This is a very important and distinguishable feature and,\n\ntherefore, at the outset, this fact has been highlighted. This Court in W.P.\n\nNo.No.3547/2017 (\nUma Shankar Dwivedi Vs. State\n) directed that the\n\ninitial pay at the time of merger would be the same as they were getting\n\nwhen they were working in the society on the date of merger. However, it\n\nwas clarified that such employees would be eligible to get benefit of\n\nrevision of pay scale in accordance with the provisions of 5 th and 6th Pay\n\nCommission. The arrears arising out of benefit of 5 th and 6th Pay\n\nCommission are required to be paid to the petitioners.\n\n(iii) As noticed, in the appeal, the Apex Court clarified it in Para 4\n\n(reproduced above) and made it clear that the parity has a limited\n\napplication. Thus, it is noteworthy that even this Court in the case of\nUma\n\nShankar Dwivedi\n(supra) did not grant benefit of revised pay scale as per\n\nRegulations of 2001 and the Apex Court in no uncertain terms made it\n\nclear that if appellant No.1 extended the benefit of pay revision under\n23 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nRegulations of 2001 to such employees who were not enjoying the pre-\n\nrevised pay scales, employees of Rewa Society cannot be given step\n\nmotherly treatment.\n\nThis aspect came up for consideration before the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in 2012 (5) MPHT 183 (Gwalior Bench)\n\n(\nM.P.S.E.B. Vs. Brajendra Singh Kushwah and others\n), it was held as\n\nunder:\n\n\"22. The judgment dated 13-9-2011 in W.P. No. 12029/2010, on which\nheavy reliance has been placed by the writ Court while rendering the\nimpugned order, has been delivered on the following two assumptions:\n\n--\n\n(i) That, the employees serving the REC Society (Manawar) were at\npar with the employees of the MPSEB in the matter of pay scales; and\n\n(ii) Since the REC Society (Manawar) employees were treated at par\nwith the MPSEB employees in the matter of pay scales, the bar\ncontained in Clause 1(c)(vi) of the Regulations of 2001 will not apply.\n\n23. The above said two features persuaded the Single Bench of this\nCourt while rendering the judgment dated 13-9-2011 in WP No.\n12029/2010 by issuing directions for treating the employees of REC\nSociety (Manawar) at par with the MPSEB employees in the matter of\npay scale and accordingly issued the directions for grant of all benefits\nto such absorbed employees as were extended to the original\nemployees of the Board.\n\n24. In the present case, the distinguishing feature is the pay disparity\nwhich existed not only since prior to the date of absorption but also\ncontinued subsequent thereto on account of the terms and conditions\ncontained in the order of the Commission granting sanction for\nrevocation of 10 REC Societies and the consequential orders of\nabsorption. It is neither pleaded nor it is the case of the petitioners that\nthere was parity of pay scale before or after absorption between the\nabsorbed employees vis-a-vis the original employees of the Board.\nResultantly the petitioners not having challenged the terms and\nconditions contained in the order of sanction for revocation of licence\ndated 20-2-2002 and also contained in the order of absorption issued\nby the Board, are now estopped from challenging the necessary\nfallout/consequence of pay disparity stemming out of the said\nunchallenged terms and conditions.\n\n25. Learned counsel for the Board has placed reliance on various\ndecisions including the Division Bench decision of this Court dated 27-\n7-2007 in Writ Appeal No. 1361/2006 rendered at the Principal Seat,\nwherein the Division Bench while dealing with facts and circumstances\nsimilar to the ones existing in this case, upheld the order of the Single\nBench passed in Writ Petition No. 463/1999 by holding in paragraphs\n18 and 19 of its decision as follows:\n\n\"18. Submissions of Mr. Ruprah, learned counsel is that as the\n24 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\napplicant's case was considered by the society for promotion and at the\ntime of absorption it was mentioned that they would be absorbed on\nthe same terms and conditions as existing in the society and he was\nJunior Engineer and, therefore, he was entitled to be promoted as\nAssistant Engineer as such Junior Engineers who have been similarly\nplaced under the services of the Board have been promoted. As is\nperceivable the Board had issued further guidelines/terms and\nconditions as per order/circular dated 5-6-2004. On reading of the\nfurther terms and conditions it cannot be said that the employee who\nhas been absorbed in the Board will get the benefit of the Board as if\nhe was an employee of the Board from very inception. The Board at\nthe time of absorption has fixed the terms and conditions and on a\nperusal of such terms and conditions it is quite clear that the Junior\nEngineer shall be given the designation but would not be considered\nfor promotion by applying the Board's regulations as if he was in the\nBoard's services. The said terms and conditions fixed by the Board are\nin consonance with the decision rendered in\nRam Parvesh Singh\n\n(supra) wherein it has been held that the Board has no obligation\ntowards the employees of the previous owner's undertaking.\n\nBe it noted\nto arrive at such a conclusion their Lordships have placed reliance on\nthe decision rendered in\nBhola Nath Mukherjee v. Government of W.B.\n,\n(1997) 1 SCC 562.\n\n19. In view of our preceding analysis we do not find any merit in the\npresent writ appeal and accordingly the same stands dismissed.\nHowever, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case there shall\nbe no order as to costs.\"\n\n26. In view of the above, it appears that the decision of the Single\nBench rendered on 13-9-2011 in WP No. 12029/2010 was based upon\ndifferent set of facts and circumstances where the parity between the\nabsorbed REC Societies employees and the original employees of the\nBoard was not disputed. Thus\n,\nthe said decision\nin W.P. No.\n12029/2010 and the reliance placed thereupon is of no avail to the\npetitioners/respondents herein, in the present case where no such parity\nexisted either before or after absorption. Thus, this Court is impelled to\nhold that the reliance placed by the Writ Court on the order dated 13-9-\n2011 passed in W.P. No. 12029/2010 while passing the impugned order\nis misplaced.\n\n27. In the conspectus of the above facts and circumstances and the\nfindings rendered, the Writ Appeal No. 137/2012, MPSEB v.\nBrajendra Singh Kushwah is allowed whereas Writ Appeal No.\n202/2012, Brajendra Singh Kushwah v. MPSEB is dismissed and the\nimpugned order dated 27-1-2012 passed in Writ Petition No.\n2459/2010 is set aside. No order as to costs.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n(iv) This judgment of Gwalior Bench was assailed by the employees\n\nbefore the Apex Court in SLP (C) No.28516/2013 decided on 27.04.2015.\n\nThe respondent-Board in Para 5 of counter-affidavit filed before the\n25 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nSupreme Court decided to grant the benefit to the petitioners and,\n\ntherefore, in terms of the counter affidavit, SLP was disposed of.\n\n(v) In 2013 SCC OnLine MP 10181 (Mukesh Chandra Gupta and\n\nothers Vs. M.P. State Electricity Board and others) decided on\n\n09.12.2013, the argument of absorbed employees was based on a Division\n\nBench judgment of Indore Bench in W.A. No.685/2011 (\nM.P. State\n\nElectricity Board Vs. Electricity Supply Employees Union\n) decided on\n\n22.04.2013. This Court in Para 8 & 9 opined as under:\n\n\"8. No doubt, the Indore Bench considered the judgment of\n\nBrajendra Singh Kushwah\n(supra). A perusal of page 5 of the\njudgment shows that in the Rural Electrification Cooperative\nSociety, Manawar the employees were getting pay scale at par with\nthe respondent-Board. In other words, the pay scales granted to the\nemployees of Cooperative Society were similar to that of the\nemployees of the Board before absorption. The absorption order\ngave protection to employees that existing terms and conditions\nwill follow. Since in Manawar Society the pay scales were same,\nthe conditions of absorption were directed to be implemented.\n\nHowever, in\nBrajendra Singh Kushwah\n(supra) the conditions were\ndifferent. Therefore, Indore Bench in para 8 of the judgment opined\nthat the present case stands on different factual footing because the\nmembers of respondent No. 1-Union were getting the same pay\nscale as employees of the Board prior to their absorption.\n\n9. In the present case, admittedly, the pay scales of the petitioners\nwere inferior in the erstwhile society and, therefore, Indore Bench\njudgment is of no assistance to them. The judgment in\nBrajendra\nSingh Kushwah\n(supra) will hold the field.\n\nIt is apt to quote paras 24\nand 26 of the judgments in\nBrajendra Singh Kushwah\n(supra), which\nreads as under:-\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n(vi) A careful reading of the judgments passed in\nBrajendra Singh\n\nKushwah and Mukesh Chandra Gupta\n(supra) makes it clear like noon day\n\nthat absorbed employees of Manawar Society were getting pay scale at par\n\nwith the employees of the respondent Board. Thus, as per the terms and\n\nconditions of the absorption, they had protection of their service conditions\n\nand for this reason, the erstwhile employees of Manawar Society were\n\ngiven the benefit of same pay scale on their absorption.\n\nThis principle and\n26 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nbenefit of such parity based on the Regulations of 2001 can be extended\n\nonly for such employees who are covered by Para 4 of the order passed by\n\nSupreme Court in the case of\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n(supra). This aspect\n\nis answered accordingly.\n\n25. Claim regarding 6th Pay Commission :\n\n(i) This aspect is no more res integra.\nIn\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n\n(supra), this Court opined that absorbed employees are entitled to get 5 th\n\nand 6th Pay Commission benefits. The Apex Court in Para 5 of said\n\njudgment opined as under:\n\n\"5. As far as implementation of recommendations of Sixth\nand Seventh Pay Commissions are concerned, there cannot be\nany dispute. The benefits will be extended to the employees of\nthe REC Societies with effect from the date of the benefits of\nthe Sixth and Seventh Pay Commission have been given to the\nemployees of Appellant No.1. If there is any arrears to be paid\nin this regard, the same shall be paid within three months from\ntoday.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n(ii) In this view of the matter, it can be safely concluded that absorbed\n\nemployees are entitled to get the benefit of corresponding pay scale as per\n\nthe recommendations of 6th Pay Commission from due date with arrears of\n\npay.\n\n26. Claim regarding counting previous service for grant of higher\npay scale/financial up-gradation and claim of family pension as\nper policy applicable to the regular employees of M.P.S.E.B. :\n\n(i) This Court in\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n(supra) opined that if previous\n\nservice conditions of the absorbed employees are protected, it cannot be\n\nsaid that they would not be entitled to get the benefit of service condition\n\navailable in the Board.\nIf this is allowed, it will mean that absorbed\n\nemployees are treated as a class separate than the regular establishment of\n\n27 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nthe respondent-Board. Thus, it will amount to discrimination which runs\n\ncontrary to\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. This cannot be\n\npermitted by framing any policy etc. In no uncertain terms, a finding was\n\ngiven that there was no policy made in this respect and even when the\n\npolicy was made, no such restriction was placed by the respondent-Board,\n\nonce absorption is completed, the petitioners became part and parcel of\n\nmain stream in the establishment of the Board and as such would be\n\nentitled to the application of service conditions of the Board. In Paras 6.3\n\nand 7 of the judgment of Panchraj Tiwari (supra), the Apex Court has\n\ntaken the same view.\n\n27. In view of aforesaid judgments, it is clear that upon absorption in\n\nM.P. S.E.B., the petitioners became employees of the Board for all\n\npurposes. They cannot be discriminated on the basis of their birth mark.\n\nOtherwise, it will amount to divide a homogeneous class and create a class\n\nwithin the class which is impermissible in the teeth of\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution. In Para 7 of the judgment of Panchraj Tiwari (supra), their\n\nLordships held that on such integration of service and upon joining in\n\nM.P.S.E.B., the absorbed employees shall be placed as junior to the\n\njuniormost officer on the date of absorption viz. 15.03.2002. Thus, the\n\npetitioners will get bottom seniority on the date of absorption. The\n\nancillary question is : whether services rendered by them in the erstwhile\n\nemployment can be counted for the purpose of qualifying service for\n\npension and qualifying service/eligibility condition for the purpose of grant\n\nof time scale of pay ? The question of grant of pension is no more res\n\nintegra. The Indore Bench in W.P. (s) No.1151/2005 considered this aspect\n28 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nin great detail. Various judgments passed by the High Court and judgment\n\nof Apex Court in Panchraj Tiwari (supra) were considered by Indore\n\nBench. After meticulous examination of legal position, the Indore Bench\n\nopined as under:\n\n\"11- Meaning thereby, the employees who have been absorbed\nwere treating at par with the employees of the M.P. State\nElectricity Board in the matter of pay scale, dearness allowance\nand other fringe benefits, meaning thereby, for all purposes the\nemployees of the Societies are the employees of M.P. State\nElectricity Board and the same benefits which have been\nextended to the employees of M.P. State Electricity Board have\nbeen extended to the employees who have been absorbed\npursuant to closure of the Society where they were initially\nappointed.\n\n12- Learned counsel for the petitioner has fairly admitted before\nthis Court that all the benefits have been granted to the\nemployees of the Society, however, in the matter of grant of\npension, the respondents are not paying the pensionary dues to\nthe employees who absorbed in the services of the Board.\n\n13- This Court in the light of the judgment delivered in the\nearlier round of litigation and also keeping in view the order\npassed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nBrajendra\nSingh Kushwaha\n(Supra) and the order passed in the case of\nPanchraj Tiwari (Supra) is of the considered opinion that once\nthe employees have absorbed in the services of the M.P. State\nElectricity Board they are the employees of M.P. State\nElectricity Board for all purposes. A instrumentality of the State\ncannot be permitted to discriminate between its employees by\ntreating the absorbed employees as a different class of\nemployees. There is one only class of employees i.e. employees\nworking in the M.P. State Electricity Board. There is a\npensionary scheme for the employees of the M.P. State\nElectricity Board, and therefore, the members of the petitioner -\nUnion, meaning thereby, all the employees absorbed in the\nservices of M.P. State Electricity Board are certainly entitled for\nthe benefits of pension scheme and other fringe benefits for\nwhich the employees of M.P.State Electricity Board are entitled.\n\n14- Resultantly, the writ petition stands allowed. The\nrespondents are directed to extend the pensionary benefits and\nother fringe benefits to the absorbed employees who are now the\nemployees of M.P. State Electricity Board. The exercise of\npassing necessary orders in respect of pensionary benefits and\nother fringe benefits be passed within a period of ninety days\nfrom the date of receipt of certified copy of this order. The writ\npetition stands allowed. No order as to costs.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n28. It is relevant to note that the employer took the same stand before\n29 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nIndore Bench that the absorbed employees and regular employees of the\n\nBoard are governed by different set of Pension Scheme etc. This stand\n\ncould not find favour before the Indore Bench. The said order of W.P.\n\nNo.1151/2005 was assailed in W.A. No.334/2015 (M.P. State Electricity\n\nBoard (Now known as\nM.P. Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Co. Ltd.\n\nIndore Vs. Bijali Karmchari Sangh\n) decided on 14.06.2016.\n\nThe Division\n\nBench after considering the judgment of Apex Court in\nPanchraj Tiwari\n\nand Brajendra Singh Kushwah\n(supra) opined as under:\n\n\"The Hon'ble Single Judge has reproduced the relevant part of all\nthe judgments, hence the issue regarding the service conditions of\nthe employees and societies who were absorbed in the Board is\nno more res integra and has been settled by this Court as well as\nby the Supreme Court. It is not in dispute that the employees who\nwere absorbed are treated at par with the employees of the Board\nshall get the benefits which includes pensionary benefits and\nother fringe benefits also. Further contention of the appellant is\nalso liable to be rejected in respect of that the employees of\npetitioner-society covered under the\nEmployees Provident Fund\nAct and Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972\nbecause once it has been\nheld that after absorption they are treated at par with the\nemployees of Board then they shall get the same benefits which\nhas been granted to the employees of the Board.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n29. The writ Court and Division Bench in said writ appeal considered\n\nthe judgment of Panchraj Tiwari (supra) in extenso and, therefore, I am\n\nunable to persuade myself with the argument of Shri Shroti that said\n\njudgment may be treated as sub silentio. In view of this binding judgment\n\npassed in W.A. No.334/2015 against which SLP No.24772/2016 was\n\ndismissed on merits on 30.11.2018, I am inclined to hold that the judgment\n\nof Indore Bench in Bijali Karmchari Sangh decided on 07.05.2015 will\n\napply mutatis mutandis to present batch of petitions.\nThus subject to\n\nfulfilling the formalities, petitioners are entitled to get pensions and fringe\n\nbenefits as per the judgment of\nBijlai Karmchari Sangh\n(supra).\n\n30 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\n30. There is no scintilla of doubt that services rendered by the petitioners\n\nin the society are taken into account for the purpose of qualifying service\n\nfor determining pension/retiral dues. The question is : whether those\n\nservices can be counted for the purpose of grant of higher pay scale ? In\n\nthe relief clause, the petitioners have categorically prayed that their\n\nprevious services from the date of entitlement in terms of the order dated\n\n04.01.2016 may be directed to be counted for the purpose of grant of third\n\nhigher pay scale. A careful reading of terms and conditions for grant of\n\nthird time scale of pay (higher pay scale) mentioned in circular dated\n\n04.01.2016 (Annexure-P/22) shows that the service shall be counted in any\n\ncadre from the date of appointment to the post, which is a regular post of\n\nthat cadre. For example, it is mentioned that in a ministerial grade, O.A.\n\nGrade III is entry post whereas for Line Staff, it is Line Attendant.\n\nSimilarly, in Engineering/Officer Cadre, Junior Engineer/Assistant\n\nEngineer or equivalent is the entry post. As per Clause (ii) of the terms and\n\nconditions, the service can be counted from the date of appointment in any\n\ncadre. As per FR-9(iv), \"Cadre\" means \"the strength of service or a part of\n\nservice sanctioned as a separate unit\". By no stretch of imagination, it can\n\nbe said that previous service of the petitioners before absorption was\n\nrendered in the cadre of M.P.S.E.B. In absence thereto, those services\n\ncannot be taken into account for the purpose of grant of higher pay scale.\n\nThus, this claim is devoid of merits and deserves rejection.\n\n31. Claim regarding benefit of medical reimbursement and\nallowances:\n\nThe petitioners have challenged the order dated 15.12.2014 [(Annexure-\n\nP/1) Clause (4)] whereby while granting the benefits of medical\n31 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\nreimbursement, allowances arising out of working during National\n\nFestivals and other allowances and benefits were extended from the date of\n\norder viz. 15.12.2014. This is trite in view of the judgment of Supreme\n\nCourt in Panchraj Tiwari (supra) that once petitioners are absorbed in\n\nM.P.S.E.B., they became employees of M.P.S.E.B.. Their origin/birth mark\n\npales into insignificance. The respondents themselves decided to grant\n\nthem aforesaid benefit from 15.12.2014. There is no justification in\n\ndepriving them from these benefits from the date of absorption. Thus, I am\n\nconstrained to hold that action of the employer in extending the aforesaid\n\nbenefits mentioned in Clause (4) of the order dated 15.12.2014 from the\n\ndate of issuance of order is bad in law. Indeed, the petitioners are entitled\n\nto get the said benefits from the date of absorption.\n\n32. In view of the foregoing analysis, these batch of petitions are\n\ndisposed of with following directions:\n\n(i) The petitioners may claim and shall be entitled to get the pay scale\n\nprescribed in the Regulations of 2001 provided their cases are\n\ncovered by Para 4 of the order passed by the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of\nUma Shankar Dwivedi\n(supra).\n\nIf their cases are covered, the\n\npetitioners may file applications claiming the said benefits and if\n\nthey are similar qua the employees of Manawar Society and their\n\ncases are covered by Para 4 of the judgment of\nUma Shankar\n\nDwivedi\n(supra), it shall be the duty of the respondents to extend the\n\nsimilar benefit of pay scale to the petitioners from due date.\n\n(ii) The petitioners are entitled to get the benefit of 6 th Pay Commission\n\nin terms of revised pay scale. If the revised pay scale has not been\n\n32 W.P. No.14594/2014 and other connected matters\n\ngiven to the petitioners as per the recommendation of 6 th Pay\n\nCommission, it shall be the duty of the respondents to extend the\n\nsame from due date with arrears.\n\n(iii) The previous service rendered in the society shall not be counted for\n\nthe purpose of grant of higher pay scale/financial up-gradation.\n\n(iv) The petitioners shall be entitled to get the benefit of pensionary\n\nscheme and other fringe benefits, which are applicable for the\n\nemployees of M.P.S.E.B. as per the judgment of Indore Bench in\n\nW.A. No.334/2015 (\nM.P. State Electricity Board (Now known as\n\nM.P. Paschim Kshetra Vidhyut Vitran Company Ltd. Indore) Vs.\n\nBijali Karmchari Sangh\n).\n\n(v) The petitioners shall get the benefits mentioned in Clause (4) of the\n\norder dated 15.12.2014 (Annexure-P/1) from the date of their\n\nabsorption.\n\n(vi) The entire exercise be completed within six months from the date of\n\ncompletion of formalities by the petitioners for grant of aforesaid\n\nbenefits.\n\n(vii) The petitioners are at liberty to file separate proceedings for other\n\nreliefs which have not been pressed and decided in the present\n\npetitions.\n\n33. The petitions are partly allowed. No cost.\n\nThe Registry shall keep the photocopy of this order in all\n\nconnected matters.\n\n(Sujoy Paul)\nJudge\nYS/Biswal\n\nSHIBA NARAYAN BISWAL\n2019.04.04 13:38:48 +05'30'",
