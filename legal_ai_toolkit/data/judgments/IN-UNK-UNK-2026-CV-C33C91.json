In all the above cases, the alleg ations\n\nag ainst the petitioners were that they were illeg ally\n\nextracting / transporting sand -the Government\n\n : 37 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\nproperty without valid permit or evad ing payment of\n\nrequired royalty. The alleg ations are that thereby\n\nthey have committed theft of Government p roperty /\n\nsand which constitute the offences punishable under\n\nSection 379\n IPC and \nSections 4\n, \n4(1)\n, \n4(1A)\n, \n21\n &\n\n42 read with \nSection 22\n of the MMDR Act and und er\n\nRules 3, 32 & 44 of the Rules.\n\n 5. The learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nseek quashing of the aforesaid proceedings on the\n\nfollowing grounds:\n\n (i) As per \nSection 22\n of the MMDR Act,\n\n only an officer authorised as per Rule\n\n 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules shall file\n\n complaints;\n\n (ii) The comp lainants / informants were not\n\n authorised persons to file the\n\n complaint.\n\n (iii) Even authorised officers have to file\n\n complaint b efore the Mag istrate and not\n\n : 38 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\n before the Station House Officer of the\n\n police station;\n\n (iv) The police are not competent to receive\n\n such complaints and take up\n\n investig ation on such complaints.\n\n 6. Sri.Praveen K.uppar, learned HCGP\n\nsubmits that the police are competent to file the\n\nreport and on such reports register FIR when the\n\ncomplaints is for the offences punishab le under \nIPC\n.\n\n 7. Therefore, the q uestion involved in all the\n\nabove cases is whether a complaint for violation of\n\nthe p rovisions of \nMMDR Act\n can be filed before the\n\nStation House Officer of a police station and on such\n\ncomplaint whether the respondent police could\n\nregister the FIR and take up the investig ation?\n\n 8. Section 22 of the MMDR Act reads as\n\nund er:\n\n \"22. Cognizance of offences.―No\n court shall take cognizance of any\n offence punishable under this Act or any\n\n : 39 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\n rules made thereunder except upon\n complaint in writing made by a person\n authorised in this behalf by the Central\n Government or the State Government.\"\n\n 9. Complaint is d efined in \nSection 2(d)\n of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [for short\n\n'\nCr.P.C\n.'] as follows:\n\n \"2. Definitions.--In this Code, unless the\n context otherwise requires.--\n\n (d) \"Complaint\" means any allegation\n made orally or in writing to a Magistrate,\n with a view to his taking action under this\n Code, that some person, whether known\n or unknown, has committed an offence but\n does not include a police report.\"\n\n 10. Rule 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules d efines the\n\nauthorised officer as follows:\n\n \"2(1) (a-1-a) \"Authorised Officer\"\n\n means an officer not below the rank of\n Group B authorized by the State\n Government or the Commissioner or the\n Director of Mines and Geology or Deputy\n Commissioner of the District to act for the\n specific purpose under these Rules.\"\n\n : 40 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\n 11. The p erusal of the above provisions make\n\nit clear that the Court is b arred from taking\n\ncognizance of the offences und er the \nMMDR Act\n or\n\nthe Rules mad e thereund er unless the comp laint in\n\nwriting is mad e by the persons authorised under\n\nRule 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules. Since \nSection 2(d)\n of\n\nCr.P.C. excludes the police report from the\n\ndefinition of complaint essentially the comp laint has\n\nto b e filed b efore the Mag istrate.\n\n 12. In these cases, complainants have not\n\nstated in their complaints that they are the persons\n\nauthorised und er Rule 2(1)(a-1-a) of the Rules to\n\nfile complaint. The complaints are not accompanied\n\nby any such authorization notifications. Even\n\nassuming that they are so authorised , the complaint\n\nin respect of the offences und er the \nMMDR Act\n and\n\nRules ought to have been filed before the Mag istrate\n\nand not before the Station House Officer of the\n\npolice station.\n\n : 41 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\n \n13. Hon'b le Sup reme Court in p arag rap hs 72\n\n& 73 of the judgment in \nState (NCT of Delhi) Vs.\n\nSanjay\n, (2014) 9 SCC 772 case in this reg ard has\n\nheld as follows:\n\n \"72. From a close reading of the\n provisions of \nMMDR Act\n and the offence\n defined under \nSection 378\n IPC, it is\n manifest that the ingredients constituting\n the offence are different. The\n contravention of terms and conditions of\n mining lease or doing mining activity in\n violation of \nSection 4\n of the Act is an\n offence punishable under \nSection 21\n of the\n MMDR Act, whereas dishonestly removing\n sand, gravel and other minerals from the\n river, which is the property of the State,\n out of State's possession without the\n consent, constitute an offence of theft.\n Hence, merely because initiation of\n proceeding for commission of an offence\n under the \nMMDR Act\n on the basis of\n complaint cannot and shall not debar the\n police from taking action against persons\n for committing theft of sand and minerals\n in the manner mentioned above by\n exercising power under the Code of\n\n : 42 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\nCriminal Procedure and submit a report\nbefore the Magistrate for taking\ncognizance against such persons. In other\nwords, in a case where there is a theft of\nsand and gravel from the Government\nland, the police can register a case,\ninvestigate the same and submit a final\nreport under \nSection 173\n Cr.P.C. before a\nMagistrate having jurisdiction for the\npurpose of taking cognizance as provided\nin \nSection 190(1)(d)\n of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\n 73. After giving our thoughtful\nconsideration in the matter, in the light\nof relevant provisions of the Act vis-à-\nvis the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n\nand the \nIndian Penal Code\n, we are of\nthe definite opinion that the\ningredients constituting the offence\nunder the \nMMDR Act\n and the\ningredients of dishonestly removing\nsand and gravel from the riverbeds\nwithout consent, which is the\nproperty of the State, is a distinct\noffence under \nIPC\n. Hence, for the\ncommission of offence under \nSection\n378\n IPC, on receipt of the police\n\n : 43 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\n report, the Magistrate having\n jurisdiction can take cognizance of the\n said offence without awaiting the\n receipt of complaint that may be filed\n by the authorised officer for taking\n cognizance in respect of violation of\n various provisions of the \nMMDR Act\n.\n Consequently, the contrary view taken by\n the different High Courts cannot be\n sustained in law and, therefore, overruled.\n Consequently, these criminal appeals are\n disposed of with a direction to the\n concerned Magistrates to proceed\n accordingly.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 14. A read ing of the above judgment makes it\n\nclear that the p olice are not competent to register\n\nthe FIR for the offences punishab le under \nMMDR Act\n\nor the Rules, but they are not b arred from\n\nregistering the FIR for the offences punishab le\n\nund er \nIPC\n. Therefore, the FIR and consequential\n\nCriminal proceedings pend ing b efore the Mag istrate\n\nin the above cases so far they relate to the offences\n\n : 44 : Crl. P. No.101802/2018\n\n & Connected cases\n\nund er \nMMDR Act\n and Rules are liable to be quashed.\n\nTherefore, the petitions are p artly allowed.\n\n 15.
