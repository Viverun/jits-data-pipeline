Deshmukh, JJ.\n\nDate : 21st March, 2012\n\nJUDGMENT (Per: Deshmukh, J.) .\n\n1. This bunch of writ petitions arises out of judgment and order dated 22.11.2002\n\npassed by the learned Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal [hereinafter referred to as\n\n\"the Tribunal\"] in Original Applications No. 254 and 256 of 2000, and subsequent orders\n\npassed in Contempt Petition No 89 of 2003 and other proceedings. [Petitioners herein\n\nare referred to as 'Petitioners' and original applicants before MAT as 'The applicants\" and\n\nthe Governments Authorities either as 'Authorities' or 'Respondents no. 1 to 3' for\n\nconvenience]\n\n2. Original Application No. 254 of 2000 had been filed on 07-04-2000 by four\n\napplicants, who are direct recruits to the Maharashtra Development Service (\"MDS\")\n\nClass I cadre, against Respondents No. 1 to 3 - the government authorities and\n\nRespondents No. 4 to 24 in said original application, who are the promotees to MDS\n\nClass-I cadre, praying for placement of the applicants in seniority list of said cadre above\n\nsaid Respondents No. 2 to 24 and for consequential benefits.\n\n3. On 10-04-2000, applicants in Original Application No. 254 of 2000 had filed\n\nOriginal Application No.256 of 2000 arraigning only aforesaid Respondents No. 1 to 3-\n\nthe govt. authorities, seeking directions to work out and declare number of posts\n\nearmarked for direct recruits from 01-04-1982 and also to workout number of promotee\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:15 :::\n\n15 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\ncandidates considering their promotions in excess of the recruitment/quota rules to be\n\nfortuitous in MDS Class-I cadre and to fill up the created posts of Additional Chief\n\nExecutive Officers in Zilla Parishad in accordance with quota rule.\n\n4. According to the applicants, MDS cadre has been an altogether new cadre formed in\n\n1973, consisting of Class-I and Class-II posts pursuant to Maharashtra Development\n\n[Constitution, Classification and Recruitment] Rules, 1973 [hereinafter referred to as\n\n'MDS Rules, 1973'] and the posts in said cadre were meant to be filled in by promotion as\n\nwell as by nomination with prescription that appointments of direct recruits [nomination]\n\nshall be in the range of 35 to 50 per cent and the rest by promotion [departmental\n\ncandidates]. The MDS Rules, 1973, have been framed in exercise of powers conferred\n\nupon the State of Maharashtra under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nAccording to them, in order to achieve proportion of 35 per cent of direct recruits till\n\n1.4.1982 and 50 percent thereafter, and to maintain the proportion under the rules, the\n\nState Government ought to take proper steps and timely action.\n\n5. The applicants have submitted that sub-rule (1) of Rule 5 of the MDS Rules,\n\n1973, requires that appointment by nomination shall be through the Commission in\n\naccordance with the rules relating to recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collectors and\n\nthat proviso thereunder requires the same to be effective from 1.4.1979 or thereafter in\n\nsuch a phased manner as would ensure that the total number of officers directly recruited\n\nin MDS Class-I cadre shall not at any time after 1.4.1982, be less than 35 per cent and\n\nmore than 50 per cent of the total number of permanent posts in that cadre.\n\n6. The applicants have alleged that respondent authorities did not take action on\n\ntheir representation in accordance with rules. According to them, direct recruitment\n\nwas sought only in 1987 though it was expected immediately on enforcement of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n16 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nrules and alleged that initiation had been only in 1985. Government had been loath to\n\ntake action which has given rise to promotion of in-service candidates from Class-II\n\ncadre. According to the applicants, all promotions of in-service candidates which are in\n\nexcess of rules are to be regarded as fortuitous. The applicants purport to go back to\n\nAugust, 1973 and seek review of the situation and removal of disparity created due to\n\nalleged non observance of quota rule. According to them, there had been no situational\n\nconstraints justifying listless approach of concerned authorities. Applicants cannot be\n\nmade to suffer on account of negligence and absence of timely action by the authorities.\n\nAccording to the applicants, no explanation in this respect should be heard from the\n\nauthorities and the authorities are required to be directed to work out the number posts\n\nwhich were and have been earmarked for direct recruitment and to work out their\n\nbacklog and take suitable steps to remove disparity and to give deemed date to the direct\n\nrecruits which they would have got in regular course. The applicants contend that\n\nseniority of the promotee candidates from MDS Class-II cadre cannot be reckoned from\n\nthe date of their actual promotion to MDS Class-I cadre having regard to proportion of\n\nrespective categories in MDS Class-I cadre to be maintained according to the rules,\n\ncontending that promotions are not according to the rules. The applicants had\n\nrequested Respondent No. 1 to look into the matter and make suitable alterations to the\n\nseniority list by properly following quota rule, to remove injustice caused to them. The\n\napplicants purport to place reliance on a few judicial pronouncements. The applicants\n\ncontend that if suitable changes are not made to the seniority list, MDS Rules, 1973,\n\nwould lose their sanctity. Apprehending a situation that the rules may not be followed in\n\nview of a news published about the Minister having declared that the creation of\n\nAdditional Chief Executive Officers' posts in Zilla Parishad in the State is for providing a\n\npromotional avenue and thus justifying original applications praying for reliefs referred\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n17 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nto hereinabove.\n\n7. The applicants have claimed that they are graduates and post graduates in various\n\ndisciplines and are working in MDS Class-l cadre posts, and that MDS Class-I cadre\n\ncomprises Deputy Chief Executive Officers of Zilla Parishad and its equivalent posts viz.\n\nBlock Development Officers Class-I, Project Officers Class-I of various units under the\n\nZilla Parishad.\n\n8. Maharashtra Public Service Commission [hereinafter referred to as \"MPSC\" or\n\n\"Commission\" ] examination of the applicants had been held in March, 1988 and the final\n\noutcome had been declared on 11.7.1988. According to applicants such declaration is a\n\nrecommendation to appoint them in MDS cadre of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer\n\nClass-I and Block Development Officer Class-I. The applicants refer to a circular dated\n\n3.12.1971 issued by the General Administration Department of Maharashtra Government\n\ninstructing appointments of the candidates selected and recommended by MPSC or by\n\nRegional Selection Board within a period of one month by completing requisite\n\nformalities and further refer to circular dated 4.4.1991 instructing expeditious\n\nappointments of MPSC recommended candidates and to speed up the process, wherever,\n\ndelays in such appointments have been brought to notice by the Members of Legislative\n\nAssembly/Council.\n\n9. The applicants make a grievance that though MPSC had recommended their\n\ncandidature to the government for appointment on 11.7.1988 and though they were\n\ndirected to undergo medical examination under communication dated 8.9.1988, yet the\n\norders were issued to them only on 1.7.1989 i.e. almost after about twelve months.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n18 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n10. The applicants' grievance is also that on 29.6.1989 i.e. just two days before their\n\norders of appointment dated 1.7.1989, orders of promotion of in-service candidates from\n\nMDS Class-II cadre had been issued by which en-bloc ten persons were promoted. It has\n\nbeen alleged that intervening 23 promotions from the date of recommendation of the\n\napplicants to the date of their actual appointments had been calculated at giving\n\nprecedence to the promotee candidates over the direct recruits. The promotee candidates\n\nwho retired before the applications were filed, have been excluded from being arrayed as\n\nrespondents. The applicants purport to allege that long distance in the appointments\n\nhad been influenced by the promotee candidates. The applicants contend that not only\n\nthe ten candidates referred to above, but respondents No. 4 to 26 have been promoted\n\nkeeping the issue of appointment of the applicants in abeyance.\n\n11. The applicants allege that even the constitution of the Departmental Promotion\n\nCommittee [hereinafter referred to as the \"DPC\"] had been subsequent to the date on\n\nwhich applicants' names were recommended by MPSC and thus claim that the\n\ndepartmental candidates' selection is subsequent in point of time. The applicants have\n\nalso contended that since the government had requisitioned direct recruits to the MPSC\n\nin 1987 pursuant to which their selection had been made, it has to be presumed that\n\nthere were vacancies of direct recruits in MDS Class-I cadre. The applicants purported to\n\nurge the Tribunal to consider the aspect as to why the State Government had remained\n\ninactive and as to how it has issued orders of appointment of the applicants immediately\n\nafter the date of promotion of the in-service candidates. Sum and substance is to allege\n\nthat the deferred issuance of appointment orders to them has been malafide, with a view\n\nto favour the promotee candidates. The applicants contend that regularization of\n\npromotion of the departmental candidates had not taken place. Placing the departmental\n\npromotee candidates over the direct recruits in the seniority list dated 7.6.1996 is grossly\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n19 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nimproper and that though they sought redressal of their grievance regarding said\n\nseniority list under a representation dated 15.1.1999, yet there has been no response.\n\n12. The respondents-applicants claimed that there was no avenue available to those\n\nworking in MDS Class I cadre till 1999. It is only in 1999 the government has given\n\nthem opportunity of getting Selection Grade in MDS cadre and also promotional avenue\n\nin the form of Additional Chief Executive Officer and thus they have contended that\n\ncreation of the cadre of Additional Chief Executive Officer shall have to be deemed to be\n\na reckoning point for the applicants to ventilate their grievance about seniority as taking\n\nup such issue to judicial forum at other point of time would have generally been an\n\nacademic exercise. The applicants this way justify their approach to the Tribunal\n\nquestioning the seniority list dated 7.6.1996 and claimed that soon after declaration of\n\npolicy of the State to provide opportunity of advancement to the candidates in MDS\n\nClass-I, they have agitated for correction in the seniority list and have requested the\n\nTribunal to appreciate and consider their case favourably. The applicants allege that the\n\npromotee candidates were in excess of their quota.\n\n13. Respondent No. 1 in its affidavit in reply dated 12.1.2001 has denied allegations\n\nof the applicants and has asserted that quota of direct recruits and promotees was and\n\nhas been maintained according to the MDS rules. The objections against interim\n\nseniority list received, were considered properly and thereafter seniority list was\n\nfinalized. It has been submitted that interim seniority list had been prepared on\n\n2.8.1995 and after inviting and considering objections to the same, on 7.6.1996,\n\nseniority list has been finalized. It has been submitted that MDS Rules, 1973 have been\n\nmade effective from July, 1981 and the MPSC had been requisitioned in 1984.\n\nExamination was held in 1985 and 14 and 16 candidates were appointed in 1986 and\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n20 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n1987 respectively through the Commission and as such, the respondent-authorities had\n\nfulfilled the quota of direct recruits. It has been specifically denied that the departmental\n\ncandidates had been promoted against the nomination quota. The Rural Development\n\nDepartment had prepared seniority list according to the relevant rules and ratio of direct\n\nrecruits and promotees had been maintained in accordance with the rules. It has been\n\ndenied that the seniority list of the candidates of MDS Group-A requires any alteration.\n\nIn support of said contention, reliance has been placed by Respondent No. 1 on various\n\ndocuments annexed to the reply, including MDS Rules, 1973 and amendments thereto\n\nfrom time to time.\n\n14.\n\nThe applicants had filed rejoinder on 13.2.2001 to the affidavit in reply\n\nsubmitted by Respondent No.1 and expressed their inability to give definitive figures of\n\nvarious posts in MDS Class-I cadre and tried to reason that out on various counts. It has\n\nbeen contended that since Class-I posts were en-bloc converted into Class-II and some of\n\nthe Class-II posts had been up-graded as Class-I posts, referring to that about 200 posts\n\nof Child Development Programme Officer (CDPO) which were earlier Class I had been\n\nconverted into Class II. According to them, certain number of posts had been increased\n\nand altogether new posts were created like Assistant Commissioner, Additional Chief\n\nOfficer of Zilla Parishad and also submitted that in the absence of exact figures, effective\n\nadjudication of the issue would be difficult. It is further submitted that strength of the\n\nMDS Class-I cadre is about 397 or thereabout throughout the State. Till rejoinder, the\n\nposts of Assistant Commissioner from said cadre had been increased from 6 to 18 and\n\nthe posts of Block Development Officer Class-I which were 32 had been increased to 202\n\nand about 150 posts of CDPOs had been abolished by shifting them as Block\n\nDevelopment Officer Class-II with conversion of CDPOs to MDS Class II from Class I\n\ncadre. According to the applicants, there were only 93 direct recruits among 397 posts\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n21 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nwhich is far too below the requirement of 50 per cent under the quota rule since\n\n1.4.1982 and claimed a backlog of 105 posts of direct recruits. The applicants purport\n\nto dispute the date of application of rules as of 1979. The applicants have also contended\n\nthat the objection to seniority list is a different issue altogether and does not have nexus\n\nto the controversy involved in Original Application No. 256 of 2000 and thus questioned\n\nimportance being given to the issue of not availing an opportunity to object to the\n\nseniority list. The applicants further went on to submit that though the issues are inter-\n\nmixed, those are, in fact, independent of each other. It has been submitted that\n\nmaintenance of quota can be considered independently from seniority. It has been\n\ncontended that promotions in favour of the concerned respondents-departmental\n\ncandidates had been temporary and by way of stop gap arrangement and relying upon\n\njudicial pronouncements of the Apex Court and the Tribunal further contended that\n\npromotions of the departmental candidates are fortuitous and apprehended that their\n\nlong tenure would be legitimized. The applicants purport to claim that in their objections\n\nto the seniority list they had relied on Sanjay Thakre's case decided by the Tribunal and\n\nreferred to that challenge to said decision of the Tribunal before the Apex Court had\n\nbeen unsuccessful.\n\n15. An additional affidavit has been filed by Respondents No. 1 to 3 on 7.3.2001 to\n\nthe rejoinder of the applicants, objecting to Original Application No. 256 of 2000 on\n\nvarious grounds, inter alia, that the same is barred by limitation, is misconceived, is not\n\ntenable, is on fancied cause of action, is stale, fixation of seniority and change in postings\n\ncannot be allowed after more than 12 years, etc. It has been contended that the original\n\napplication has been filed far beyond expiry of period of one year from accrual of cause of\n\naction as per\nSection 21\nof the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 and that too has been\n\nfiled without any application for condonation of delay. It has further been submitted\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n22 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nthat there is no compliance of requirement under\nsection 20\nof said Act, namely, making\n\nan appeal and in the absence of provision of appeal, a representation. According to the\n\nrespondents, even though promotions have been given in 1989, no appeals had been\n\nfiled then and even if it is considered that the applicants were aggrieved by fixation of\n\nseniority as on 7.6.1996, neither representation nor appeal has been filed within the\n\nstipulated period under said Act and the representation dated 15.1.1999 cannot be\n\nentertained as the same is not permissible. It has been submitted that applicants who\n\nhave failed to avail of opportunity to object to seniority list at appropriate occasion, are\n\nnow precluded from questioning the same. It has been submitted that permanent cadre\n\nis comprised of 54 permanent posts and considering the fact that with the second batch\n\nof direct recruits being introduced their total number in the cadre is 31 which is more\n\nthan 50 per cent of the strength of the permanent cadre and hence, the government\n\nought not to have called for third batch of the applicants from MPSC. According to the\n\nrespondents, even calling of new candidates in 1987 had been contrary to the\n\nrecruitment rules. Said respondents have given a table in their additional affidavit,\n\nwherein they have referred to that permanent posts during 1981 to 1985 which were 54,\n\nand temporarily sanctioned were 41 and in 1987 out of 54 permanent posts, 31 had been\n\noccupied by direct recruits and in 1989 with appointments of applicants' batch the same\n\nhad been increased to 71. According to the table, during the period 1980 to 1990, there\n\nhad been increase in permanent posts from 54 to 95 and temporary posts from 41 to 155.\n\nThe respondents contended that the applicants and others had been appointed by\n\nusurping the posts of promotees. According to them, quota is to be counted with\n\nreference to permanent posts and as such, no injustice has been caused to the applicants.\n\n16. A further rejoinder came to be filed on behalf of the applicants through one Dr\n\nN.B. Gite, on 4.4.2002. In the further rejoinder, the figures of permanent posts referred\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n23 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nto by Respondents No. 1 to 3 in their additional affidavit have been sought to be disputed\n\nby the applicants . According to the applicants, even going by the calculations made by\n\nthe respondents, there had been in all 285 incumbents working in MDS Class-I cadre out\n\nof which 56 were appointed by direct recruitment and the rest by promotion of\n\ndepartmental candidates. Deponent, however, has also stated that the promotee\n\ncandidates are not only continued to be in the seniority list, but have also been bestowed\n\nupon further benefits by treating them to be integral part of MDS Class-I cadre.\n\nAccording to him, had some candidates been on deputation, then their names could not\n\nbe included in the seniority list of MDS Class-I. The respondents as such would not be\n\nable to claim that some of the persons had been working on deputation. It has been\n\nalleged that such claims have been put-forth only with a view to deprive the direct\n\nrecruits of their progress in service career and proper placement in the seniority list and\n\ngiving correct proportion of quota rule. He purports to rely on a chart annexed to the\n\nfurther rejoinder and alleges that it falsifies the claim of respondent-authorities and that\n\nthe authorities have avoided to furnish the correct and exact factual information to the\n\napplicants and requests for proper directions to the respondents to place on record\n\nfactual data of MDS Class-I cadre. According to the chart annexed to the further\n\nrejoinder, there were in all 507 promotions as against which there had been only 87\n\ndirect recruitments upto 1999.\n\n17. The applicants also filed additional affidavit in July, 2002, contending that\n\nrequisitions to MPSC by respondents pre-suppose assessment of posts after proper\n\ncalculation of requirement of direct recruits as well as promotees and as such, the reply\n\nfiled by Respondents No.1 to 3 is unsustainable. It is submitted that there had been no\n\nreference to excess appointments of direct recruits in the first affidavit, as, according to\n\nthe applicants, there had been no scope for such excess appointments and claimed that it\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n24 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nis not such a trivial thing as has been considered by the respondents. The additional\n\naffidavit gives stress on creation of 31 posts of Block Development Officers Class-I\n\npursuant to provisions of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samities Act,\n\n1961 and as such claims that such posts cannot be termed as temporary posts and have\n\nbeen wrongly so claimed by the respondents. According to the applicants, under MDS\n\nRules, 1973, in all 75 posts were created, comprising 25 each, of Deputy Chief Executive\n\nOfficer (General) and (Village Panchayat) and Planning Officers since there were only 25\n\ndistricts in the State. However, now the situation has undergone a change and there are\n\nabout 35 districts in the State, requiring one Deputy Chief Executive Officer each for\n\nGeneral, Village Panchayat and Planning, therefore, at least 62 posts of the Deputy Chief\n\nExecutive Officer are in existence, in addition to 10 posts of CDPO under Integrated Child\n\nDevelopment Scheme most of which have been of permanent nature since 1981. The\n\napplicants claim that the stand taken by the respondents is inconceivable. The nature of\n\nwork performed by the incumbents holding a post in cadre is permanent. According to\n\nthem, in addition, four more posts of Assistant Commissioner were created during the\n\nperiod from 1977 to 1980 and there were about 152 posts of MDS Class I cadre of\n\npermanent nature. The applicants claim that there were about 235 posts in MDS Class I\n\ncadre for more than three years which ought to have been treated as permanent posts\n\nand have sought clarification from Respondents No. 1 to 3 on the same.\n\n18. The applicants rely on the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority)\n\nRules 1982 regarding general principles of seniority and fortuitous appointments referred\n\nto thereunder and submit that ad-hoc/stop gap arrangement would not be required to be\n\nreckoned for the purpose of seniority unless the appointment is according to the rules\n\nand as such, quota under the rules has to be taken into consideration. The applicants\n\nfurther rely on definitions of `temporary post' and `permanent post' which respectively\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n25 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nmean a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned for a limited time and a post\n\ncarrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned without time limit. According to the\n\napplicants, it is not open to the respondent-authorities to contend that there existed only\n\n95 posts in MDS Class I cadre in 1987 and that from the same, only 54 were permanent\n\nand the rest were temporary. The applicants by referring to various government\n\nresolutions and circulars from 1967 onwards, issued from time to time, claimed that it\n\nhas been the consistent policy of the government to convert temporary posts into\n\npermanent ones. It has been alleged that the government is not coming forth with\n\nsincere and bonafide stand with regard to exact number of posts in MDS Class I cadre.\n\nAccording to them, though the post of Integrated Child Development Officer Class-I\n\nforms integral part of MDS Class I cadre, the government is refusing to accept the same.\n\nThe applicants tried to support their said claim by making reference to a 1997\n\nnotification issued by MPSC which, inter alia, refers to the ICDO Class-I cadre and such\n\nclubbing, according to the applicants, is sufficient indication of ICDO Class I forming\n\nintegral part of MDS Class-I cadre.\n\n19. The applicants have also claimed that there is a policy of the government since\n\nMarch 1970 that fifty per cent of the total posts in the cadre should be filled in by direct\n\nrecruitment which is exemplary part of the government resolution dated 7.3.1996.\n\nAccording to the applicants, when the rules have occupied the field, the same will have to\n\nscrupulously followed. However, it is contended by the applicants that the provision for\n\nquota for direct recruits under the rules is being given a go-bye and that ad-hoc/stop gap\n\npromotions are not required to be considered for the purpose of counting seniority.\n\nAccording to the applicants, though as per the Government Resolution dated 29.8.1979,\n\nthe posts of CDPO are temporary addition to MDS Class-I cadre, by passage of time and\n\nby virtue of various government resolutions, circulars and policy, those have acquired the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n26 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nstatus of substantive posts on expiry of period of three years. According to the applicants,\n\nthere is no substance in the objection/contention that the original applications are\n\nwithout joining necessary parties, as according a decision of the Apex Court, in case of\n\ndispute over a particular principle or rule, the State is the only necessary party.\n\n20. An additional rejoinder affidavit has been filed on 12.8.2002 by respondents No.\n\n1 to 3 contending inter alia, that applications are fishing and roving in nature, that\n\nrejoinder of applicants are vague and camouflage void and null claims by irrelevant\n\ncontentions and allegations, that applicants have no locus to seek reliefs and have\n\ndisputed alleged mandate of immediate appointments of direct recruits on selection by\n\nMPSC making reference to the past events, have stated that promotions have been\n\nthrough DPC, have denied correctness of information of applicants and have alleged\n\nthat rejoinders of applicants are intended to create confusion and have disputed claims\n\nunder the same.\n\n21. It appears that extensive hearing had taken place before the learned Tribunal and,\n\nby judgment and order dated 22. 11.2002, the Division Bench of the Tribunal had\n\nallowed Original Application No.256 of 2000, directing Respondent No. 2 therein to\n\nprepare a fresh seniority list by strictly following quota rule and to give appropriate\n\ntreatment to the direct recruits and promotees in their respective posts, with a further\n\ndirection to prepare seniority list of each year during which appointments by nomination\n\nwere made as on 1st January or 1st April of the respective year with meticulous\n\nidentification of all the posts having attributes of permanency and to complete the\n\nexercise within a time-frame of six months. It was also declared that till preparation of\n\nrevised seniority list, the existing seniority list shall continue to be merely working one\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n27 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nand benefits flowing therefrom, if any, shall remain fortuitous. It was held by the learned\n\nTribunal that the promotion orders were issued hastily.\n\n22. Writ Petition No.2055 of 2003 has been filed by Abdul Rauf Shaikh against\n\naforesaid decision of the Tribunal, who has entered the government service by selection\n\nthrough MPSC in 1980 and served as District Inspector of Land Records and had been\n\npromoted as Block Development Officer Class II since 1983. He was thereafter promoted\n\nto MDS Class I cadre by notification in 1989 having considered by the departmental\n\npromotion committee. Rule had been issued in the said petition, on 15th July, 2003\n\nwith a direction to place the same with Writ Petition No. 2178 of 2003, which writ\n\npetition had been filed by government authorities impugning the very same order of the\n\nTribunal dated 22nd November, 2002 in which also rule had been issued by this Court.\n\nHowever, this Court had made the seniority that will be fixed, subject to outcome of the\n\nwrit petition.\n\n23. Writ Petition No.3469 of 2003 has been filed by Ankush Bagate and others,\n\nseeking quashing of the judgment and order dated 22nd November, 2002 passed by the\n\nTribunal, in which rule had been issued on 7th December, 2003. By an order dated\n\n6.2.2004 it had been made clear that seniority list fixed shall be subject to outcome of the\n\nWrit Petition.\n\n24. To the aforesaid order of the Tribunal, as well as further orders passed by it in the\n\ncontempt proceedings and other applications, exception has been taken in the present\n\nbatch of writ petitions.\n\n25. The applicants in original application No. 256 of 2000 had filed Contempt\n\nPetition No. 89 of 2003 before the Tribunal, alleging non-compliance of order dated\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n28 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n22.11.2002 of the Tribunal directing preparation of fresh seniority list. In the Contempt\n\nPetition, an order came to be passed by the learned Tribunal on 28-04-2004. Under the\n\norder, the Tribunal purported to explain to the respondents implications of non\n\ncompliance of its order in original applications purporting to give concrete example\n\nrequiring proportionate apportionment between direct recruits and promotees and\n\nconversion of posts into permanent ones and directing preparation of revised seniority\n\nlist, for the period 1984 to 1990 in the first instance, within a period of six weeks and\n\nsubmit the same to it.\n\n26. It appears that after the order dated 28-04-2004 was passed by the Tribunal, the\n\nRespondent-State had filed Miscellaneous Application No. 219 of 2004 before the\n\nTribunal seeking stay to proceedings of contempt petition No. 89 of 2003. One of the\n\npetitioners in Writ Petition No. 3469 of 2003, namely, Namdeo Malhari Raskar had filed\n\nMiscellaneous Application No.126 of 2004 for intervention in the contempt petition. The\n\nTribunal rejected both the miscellaneous applications, observing that petitioners should\n\nfile appropriate proceedings to challenge order dated 28-04-2004.\n\n27. Aforesaid order in contempt proceedings and the orders passed in miscellaneous\n\napplications were challenged before this court in a batch of writ petitions bearing No.\n\n4650, 4661 and 4663 of 2004. Under order dated 22-07-2004 passed in said group of\n\npetitions, this Court had directed the Tribunal to hear the application for stay of the\n\ncontempt proceedings, irrespective of rejection of such application on the ground of\n\nlocus in the contempt petition. While passing said order dated 22.7.2004, this\n\nCourt was alive to the fact that while dealing with the contempt proceedings, the\n\nTribunal had given directions explaining its earlier order in the original applications\n\nwhich were likely to affect the parties to the original application. This Court, therefore,\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n29 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nfelt it necessary to direct the Tribunal to independently consider the applications of the\n\npetitioners therein including for relief of stay of the contempt proceedings.\n\n28. Accordingly, petitioners in Writ Petition No. 2466 of 2005 had filed review\n\napplication No.11 of 2004 and petitioners in Writ Petition No. 4650 of 2004 had filed\n\nreview application No. 12 of 2004 before the Tribunal. By its judgment and order dated\n\n3.11.2004, the Tribunal dismissed both the review applications, holding that the order\n\ndated 28.4.2004 passed in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003 which was under review\n\nwas calrificatory in nature and further that the contempt petitioners did not insist on\n\ngiving effect to implementation of directions/observations of the Tribunal in its order\n\ndated 28.4.2004 because of the statement made on behalf of the government-respondent\n\nNo. 2 as the cause of discontent had ceased to subsist.\n\n29. Writ Petition No. 2466 of 2005 has been preferred by petitioners in Writ Petition\n\n3469 of 2003, challenging the order passed by the Tribunal on 3rd November, 2004 in\n\nReview Applications No.11 and 12 of 2004, and to have set aside, order dated 28th\n\nApril, 2004 in contempt petition. It appears that in the interregnum, the contempt\n\npetition had been disposed of under order dated 21.1.2006 and the seniority list of MDS\n\nClass I cadre had been been published on 21.11.2005. Thus, it was prayed under\n\namendment to writ petition no.2466 of 2005 that those orders as well as the seniority list\n\nbe quashed and set aside and that no promotion orders pursuant to the same be issued.\n\nIn this petition, this court passed an order on 8.4.2005 issuing \"Rule\" and granting\n\ninterim relief in terms of prayer clause \"B\" which runs as under:\n\n\"B. That, pending final disposal of this Writ Petition as and by way of interim\nrelief, stay may be given to the effect and operation and implementation of the\norder dated 28th April 2004 and particularly to the seniority list which has been\nprepared in the light of the so called clarificatory order given by the Honourable\nTribunal dated 28th April 2004 in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003.\"\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n30 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nThis relief, however, was granted without precluding implementation of the order of the\n\nTribunal dated 22.11.2002 expecting that the matter would be heard peremptorily on\n\n6.9.2005. The petitioners have further referred to that one more Writ Petition No. 6451\n\nof 2004 had been filed in the High Court wherein this Court had declined to interfere on\n\nthe count that it was a follow up action.\n\n30. Writ Petition No.2980 of 2005 has been filed by one Sahebrao Waghmare,\n\nimpugning final seniority list published on 21.11.2005, by the Deputy Secretary, Rural\n\nand Water Conservation Department of Government of Maharashtra.\n\n31.\n\nWrit Petition No. 4023 of 2007 has been preferred by the Petitioners,\n\nagainst order passed by the Tribunal in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003 in Original\n\nApplication No.256 of 2000 and the final seniority list dated 22nd November, 2005\n\npublished by the Rural Development and Water Conservation Department of Government\n\nof Maharashtra, and seeking a mandamus to the Government to prepare provisional and\n\nfinal seniority lists on the basis of the MDS Class I cadre, excluding schematic / ex-cadre\n\nposts.\n\n32. In all the aforesaid Writ Petitions, \"rule\" has been issued. Save granting of interim\n\nrelief in terms of prayer clause (B) in Writ Petition No. 2466 of 2005, in other writ\n\npetitions grant of interim relief had not been considered, expecting to take up those for\n\nfinal hearing sooner and expeditiously.\n\n33. It has been referred to that the Respondent-State had published a revised interim\n\nseniority list of MDS Class I cadre, which has prejudicially affected the petitioner-\n\npromotees. Some of the Petitioners have raised objection to said revised interim seniority\n\nlist. It has been alleged that though the contempt petition had been pending, the seniority\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n31 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nlist dated 28.10.2004 has been prepared as if it is in faithful compliance of the order of\n\nthe Tribunal dated 22.11.2002.\n\n34. The Petitioners contend that order dated 28.4.2004 in Contempt Petition No.89\n\nof 2003 is in excess of the jurisdiction of the proceedings under contempt and that said\n\norder substantially modifies the basic order dated 22.11.2002 passed in Original\n\nApplication No.256 of 2000. The Petitioners purport to claim that although the order of\n\nthis Court in Writ Petition No.4650, 4661 and 4663 of 2004 had been pointed out to the\n\nTribunal, yet the Tribunal had rejected the review applications. Having regard to\n\naforesaid, according to the petitioners, they had been left with no alternative but to\n\ninvoke powers and jurisdiction of this Court under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution of\n\nIndia against series of orders passed by the Tribunal, including order dated 3.11.2004\n\nand the seniority lists published on 28.10.2004 and 21.11.2005.\n\n35. Petitioners with specific reference to MDS Rules, 1973 have contended that under\n\nsub-rule (4) of Rule 3 thereof, composition of the MDS Class-I cadre has been referred\n\nto and have also referred to that sub-rule 6 provides mechanism and/or procedure for\n\nalteration in the number of posts by inclusion or exclusion of post and categories. It\n\nhas been contended that from MDS Class-I cadre posts, 25 posts of Planning Officers\n\nhave been removed and transferred to Finance and Statistics Department of the State.\n\n36. The petitioners have contended that the Tribunal had been in gross error in\n\ndirecting the Authorities under its order dated 28.4.2004 in contempt proceedings to take\n\ninto account such posts which do not form part of MDS Class-I cadre, and further that\n\n29 posts of Project Director (DRDA), 8 of Programme Officer (DPAP) 29 of Planning\n\nOfficer, 4 of Regional Nutrition Officer and 4 of Child Development Officer cannot be part\n\nand parcel of MDS Class-I cadre.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n32 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n37. The petitioners have alleged that the State has been in gross error in taking of\n\nfluctuating stands in the matter, as on one hand on affidavit it has been contended that\n\naforesaid 231 posts do not form part of MDS Class-I cadre and quota rule was not\n\napplicable to those and has yet referred to those in the chart of MDS Class-I cadre.\n\n38. The petitioners contend that the District Rural Development Authority is a\n\ncorporate body under the provisions of the\nMaharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960\n\nand is an independent establishment separate from Government of Maharashtra. The\n\nposts of Programme Officer are created by orders of the Central Government for the\n\npurpose of Water Share Development Programme. The posts of Deputy Chief Executive\n\nOfficer (Child Welfare) are creation of Women and Child Development Department of the\n\nState Government. Posts of Child Development Officer have been created pursuant to\n\nthe directions given by the Central Government from 1971 to 1992. It is submitted that\n\nall the posts referred to herein above are schematic/project/programme posts, which\n\nhave been given extension from year to year, and their financing is shared by the State\n\nand Central Governments. It has been submitted that schematic/project/programme\n\nposts are inherently temporary in nature and the posts cannot be accorded status of MDS\n\nClass-I cadre and has not been so accorded by any notification or order. Most of the\n\naforesaid posts have lapsed during 1999-2000 and were not part of regular\n\nestablishment or for that matter MDS Class-I cadre and as such quota rule would not be\n\napplicable to them.\n\n39. As regards posts of Planning Officer, it is submitted that 29 posts of Planning\n\nOfficer had been en-bloc transferred to the Finance and Statistic Department of\n\nGovernment of Maharashtra resulting in reduction of strength of Class I cadre.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n33 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n40. It was thus contended that the Tribunal has been in absolute error in issuing\n\ndirections on 28.04.2004 referring it to as clarification in nature whereunder it had been\n\ndirected to confirm 80 percent of posts and subsequently the rest of 20 percent.\n\nAccording to applicants, the State under the circumstances was compelled to take into\n\nconsideration said posts although they never formed MDS Class-I cadre .\n\n41. The petitioners have objected to exercise of powers by Tribunal and the manner\n\nin which the orders have been passed in contempt proceedings, which according to them\n\nmodify the original order, without taking into account distinction between jurisdiction in\n\ncontempt and that in review. It has been contended that though the Tribunal refers to\n\norder dated 28.4.2004 as \"order in nature of clarification\", the order, in fact modifies and\n\nreviews order dated 22.11.2002.\n\n42. According to applicants, while the final orders of the Tribunal passed in original\n\napplications no. 254 and 256 of 2004 were sub judice before the High Court, there was\n\nno propriety in passing further orders concerning order dated 22.11.2002, especially\n\nwhen the High Court had seisin over the matter. It is submitted that the High Court\n\nhad therefore passed order in respect of the Tribunal's orders in subsequent proceedings.\n\nIt has been submitted that none of the situations warranted invocation of jurisdiction for\n\ncontempt or review of the order dated 22.11.2002 passed by the Tribunal and as such\n\nthe Tribunal has been in gross error in passing further orders.\n\n43. In paragraph 27 of the Writ Petition, the petitioners have reproduced observations\n\nof the Tribunal in the order dated 28.4.2004. It would be worthwhile to refer to those\n\nwhich are as under:\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n34 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n\"27. Shri Jagtap-Under Secretary to the Government in the Rural Development\nand the Water Conservation Department Mantralaya, Mumbai is present in the\n\nTribunal. He has been explained what actually, are implications of the final order.\n\nWe have also given a concrete example, for the purpose of illustruction. For\ninstance, if there are posts in the year 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989, as\nthe case may be continuously for the period, in excess of three years 140 slots will\ngo to the share of the appointees by the nomination and 140 slots will go to the\n\npromotees. Further for instance, if there are 100 posts, in existence over the\nperiod of time, continuously, 80 of those posts would need to be converted into\nthe permanent post in the fourth year 16 more post to be converted into fifth year,\nthree more post to be converted into sixth year and the remaining one post is to\nbe converted in the seventh year. In the process all 100 posts would need to be\n\nconverted into permanent post subject to all posts those being continuously in\nexistence for the period of seven years.\"\n\n44.\n\nThe Petitioners contend that there is no such point discussed at all in the order\n\npassed in Original Application nor any such arguments were advanced which is borne out\n\nfrom the original order of the Tribunal dated 22.11.2002. According to the petitioners,\n\nthere is no question of clarification as has been stated by the Tribunal and as such even\n\nassuming the same for the sake of arguments, advisory role was not warranted, for,\n\naccording to them, it is an otiose act as purported clarification is about a non subsisting\n\nthing.\n\n45. According to the petitioners, afore-quoted paragraph proceeds on assumption\n\nthat there is a government resolution according to which permanency can be granted to a\n\ntemporary post on expiry of certain number of years, whereas the factual position is\n\ndifferent. The petitioners contend that by giving directions as quoted above, there has\n\nbeen gross transgression of power by the Tribunal and, according to them, same\n\namounts to assumption of jurisdiction for review in contempt proceedings which is illegal\n\nand untenable. The Tribunal could not make short work of the same by terming it to be\n\nclarification, instead of modification. According to the petitioners, the Tribunal had been\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n35 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nin absolute error since this point had been specifically raised and yet it had not been\n\ndiscussed.\n\n46. The petitioners contend that in the absence of identification of posts having\n\nattributes of permanency as directed under paragraph 32 of the original order dated\n\n22.11.2002, further exercise has been futile and plainly bad in law and illegal.\n\n47. Making a reference to the data considered by the Tribunal in its original order,\n\nit is submitted by the petitioners that it was imperative to have considered the total\n\nstrength of the MDS Class I cadre only as contained in MDS rules.\n\n48. According to the petitioners, there has been mutual incompatibility in the\n\nobservations in the original order passed on 22.11.2002 and those on 28.4.2004, for, in\n\nparagraph 32 of the original order, it has been stated that paragraph 9 of the said order\n\nshould be read in paragraph 32 which, according to the petitioners, is by way of\n\ndiscussion and it does not form part of the operative order, while in the order dated\n\n28.4.2004, the Tribunal observes that whatever has been stated in the body of the order\n\namounts to mandatory directions whether it be expressed in the operative part of the\n\norder or otherwise. According to the petitioners, in such a case, the directions contained\n\nin paragraph 32 were redundant. According to them, even if it is assumed that the order\n\ndated 28.4.2004 has its genesis in the Government Resolution dated 7.3.1996, said\n\nresolution, however, applies to temporary occupancies beyond the period of three years\n\nin respect of the posts which are on permanent establishment and corollary of the same is\n\nthat the government resolution would not help the posts on temporary establishment\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n36 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nand the State has given year wise total strength of MDS Class I cadre Officers working on\n\nvarious posts in the affidavit in reply.\n\n49. The petitioners contend that the order dated 28.4.2004 causes enlargement of\n\nscope of observations under paragraph 9 of the order dated 22.11.2002 and the same is\n\nin modification not only of the original order but even the Government Resolution dated\n\n7.3.1996 which relates and confines only to the posts on permanent establishment\n\ninasmuch as the order dated 28.4.2004 directs application of said Government Resolution\n\nto the posts not on the permanent establishment.\n\n50.\n\nThe petitioners intend to submit that in terming order dated 28.4.2004,\n\nas clarificatory, the Tribunal is under misconception and is absolutely a\n\nmisnomer.\n\n51. The petitioners have submitted that the Tribunal has committed error in\n\napproving the seniority list dated 21.11.2005 of MDS Group A, considering the same to\n\nbe in conformity with the order passed by this Court in Civil Application No.7793 of\n\n2005 in Writ Petition No.2466 of 2005, absolutely without considering that the interim\n\nrelief in terms of prayer clause (B) granted by this Court was to the operation and\n\nimplementation of the order dated 28.4.2004 since said seniority list has been prepared\n\npursuant to order dated 28.4.2004 in Contempt Petition No.89 of 2003 and without\n\nrealizing that this Court had not stalled the original order of the Tribunal dated\n\n22.11.2002 in Original Applications No. 254 and 256 of 2000.\n\n52. The petitioners submit that the Tribunal, in fact, defies the order of the High\n\nCourt dated 08.04.2005 and ignores the effect of the order of this Court which has\n\nstayed effect, implementation and operation of the order passed by the Tribunal on\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n37 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n28.04.2004 in Contempt Petition No. 89 of 2003. According to the petitioners,\n\nthe seniority list dated 21.11.2005 approval to which was purportedly granted by the\n\nTribunal is practically the same as prepared on 28.10.2004. The petitioners have\n\nalleged that the Government has committed an error in inclusion of posts which were\n\ndown graded, discontinued or transferred to other departments from the cadre of MDS\n\nClass-I group A. The petitioners have alleged that the Tribunal while approving the\n\nseniority list of MDS Group A dated 21.11.2005 for application of quota rule has ignored\n\nthe recruitment rules and the directions issued by this Court. According to the\n\npetitioners, order dated 21.01.2006 of the Tribunal in Contempt Petition No. 89 of\n\n2003 is contrary to the rules and directions of this Court. The petitioners submit that\n\ngrave prejudice would be caused to them in implementation of aforesaid seniority list and\n\nnot only that their position would be affected but also their pay scales would face\n\ndownward motion. According to the petitioners, there has been no proper\n\nimplementation of the original order of the tribunal dated 22.11.2002 and the\n\nGovernment has not yet taken any decision and as such, the directions of the Tribunal\n\ncannot be implemented and further that the directions, on factually incorrect\n\nassumption of a government resolution when there is no such one, are unsustainable.\n\n53. In original applications No. 254 and 256 of 2010 the Tribunal appears to have\n\nconsidered that the question involved in the matter is of inter-se seniority between the\n\ndirect recruits and promotees and application of quota rule (MDS Rules, 1973). It\n\nappears, the Tribunal purported to take into account historical background in creation\n\nof MDS.\n\n54. According to the Tribunal, strength of class-I officers had been 110 and aforesaid\n\nwere permanent posts, whether notified or otherwise. The Tribunal further purports to\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n38 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nsay that the posts of Deputy Chief Executive Officers and Block Development Officers are\n\nstatutory posts, being Secretaries to the Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis\n\nrespectively in terms of the Maharashtra Zill Parishads and Panchayat Samities Act, 1961\n\nand, therefore, cannot be said to have been sanctioned for a limited period of time and\n\nwent on to observe that these posts are permanent posts, irrespective of whether any\n\nnotifications making them permanent were issued or otherwise.\n\n55. The Tribunal has purported to refer to meaning and definition of a few terms and\n\nexpressions from Rule 9 of MCS (General Conditions of Service) Rules 1981, viz. \"cadre\"\n\nto mean a group of permanent as well as temporary posts, sanctioned from time to time,\n\nof a service or a part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit. Then \"permanent post\"\n\nwhich is to mean a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned without limit of time,\n\nand \"temporary post\" meaning a post carrying a definite rate of pay sanctioned for a\n\nlimited time. Thereafter, the Tribunal has also referred to rule 3 of the Maharashtra Civil\n\nServices (Regulation of Seniority) Rules 1982 and expressions thereunder, viz. \"direct\n\nrecruit\" meaning in relation to any post, cadre or service, a person appointed by\n\nnomination, so also term \"fortuitous appointment\" meaning a temporary appointment\n\nmade pending a regular appointment in accordance with the provisions of the relevant\n\nrecruitment rules, as also \"promotee: which means, in relation to any post, cadre or\n\nservice, a Government servant appointed thereto by promotion from a lower post, cadre\n\nor service. The Tribunal has also referred to Rule 4(1) of said Seniority Rules which\n\nspeaks of seniority of a government servant in relation to any post, cadre or service being\n\nordinarily determined on the length of his continuous service therein and further that\n\nservice rendered under \"fortuitous appointment\" shall be excluded from computation of\n\nlength of service and the incumbent shall be deemed to have been appointed from the\n\ndate on which his regular appointment is made in accordance with relevant rules.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n39 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n56. The Tribunal clarifies that the events/developments narrated in paragraphs 3 and\n\n4 of its judgment are for the period prior to the formation of Maharashtra Development\n\nService and found that it is only in 1973 that the Maharashtra Development Service\n\n(Constitution, classification and recruitment) Rules 1973 have been framed for Zilla\n\nParishads and that as per rules 3(2) and 3(4) of the Rules, the Development Service shall\n\nconsist of classes, namely,\n\n(a) Maharashtra Development Service Class I (super time scale)\n\n(b) Maharashtra Development Service Class I, and\n\n(c) Maharashtra Development Service Class II.\n\nIt has been noted by the Tribunal that as per sub rule (4) of Rule 3, the MDS Class I\n\nshall consist following posts:-\n\n(a) 25 posts of Deputy Chief Executive Officers of Zilla Parishads\n\n(b) 25 posts of Administrative Officers of Zilla Parishads\n\n(c) 25 posts of Planning Officers of Zilla Parishads and\n\n(d) 31 posts of Block Development Officers (Higher Grade) of Zilla Parishads.\n\n57. According to the Tribunal, however, there is omission to add four posts of\n\nAssistant Commissioner (Development) under oversight and/or inadvertence in their\n\ninclusion in aforesaid Class I service and purported to hold that said four posts continue\n\nto to be MDS Class I. According to the Tribunal, the omission underwent corrective\n\naction from 1980. The Tribunal has then referred to that there has been transfer of 25\n\nposts of Planning Officer from MDS Class I to Maharashtra Economics and Statistical\n\nService Class I under the Directorate of Economics and Statistics.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n40 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n58. Thereafter the Tribunal observes that around 1985, 25 posts of District Rural\n\nDevelopment Agencies (DRDA)came into existence under\nSocieties Registration Act\nand\n\nunder memorandum/Articles of Association, 25 posts of Project Director (i.e. Project\n\nOfficers as were earlier termed) DRDA came into existence without prescription of time\n\nlimit and according to the Tribunal, those posts too were manned by MDS Class I Officers\n\nirrespective whether those posts were notified as permanent or otherwise. The Tribunal\n\nthen vaguely referred to that these posts acquired status of statutory posts that is to say\n\npermanent posts.\n\n59. The Tribunal has then referred to Rule 5 of 1973 Rules and has purportedly\n\nconsidered that there were only two modes provided for recruitment/appointment in\n\nMDS Class I viz. (i) by promotion from among members of MDS Class II or by temporary\n\ntransfer of Officers from Class I Service of the State.\n\n60. Thereafter, the Tribunal refers to rule 7 of the 1973 Rules regarding absorption\n\nof certain officers. Sub rule (2) of Rule 7 specifically provides that, for the category of\n\nofficers to be so absorbed, only 25 per cent posts in MDS Class I shall be reserved.\n\n61. The Tribunal relies, on a government notification dated 11.7.1974 issued by Rural\n\nDevelopment Department whereunder the government had declared a few posts\n\ninvolving duties comparable in importance and responsibilities attached to those in MDS\n\nClass I and on amended rule 5 referring to that appointment in MDS Class I would now\n\nbe from three sources, namely, (i) nomination, (ii) promotion and (iii) transfer of officer.\n\n62. The Tribunal, in paragraph 13 of its judgment, has observed that the respondents\n\nhad specifically stated that these rules came into effect from 20.7.1981 and further that\n\nthe same has little relevance to the decision on controversy involved in the matter.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n41 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, the amendments came into effect from 1.4.1979 and has\n\nfurther observed to that the proviso to the rule creates a first impression that the ratio\n\nwith regard to quota of direct recruits and that of promotees is variable from 1.4.1982 i.e.\n\n35 to 50 for direct recruits and 65 to 50 for promotees. According to the Tribunal,\n\nhowever, this was a result of \"clumsy articulation\" and, in fact, according to the Tribunal,\n\n\" the intent obviously was to transit from the minimum level to the maximum level in a\n\nphased manner after the minimum level was achieved by 1st April 1982.''\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal purports to say that the proviso will have to be read in harmony\n\nwith the government circular of General Administration Department dated 26.3.1970\n\nwhich, according to the Tribunal, as the Administrative Reorganization Committee had\n\nrecommended to maintain proper balance between direct recruitment and promotion\n\nto posts in Class I Service and to raise direct recruitment to 50 per cent and accordingly\n\nto review the existing ratio, necessarily implies and mandates that, existing proviso\n\nought to conform to the recommendations, therefore, the proviso ought to have been\n\nbetter articulated. The proviso as subsisting is as under:\n\n\" Provided that, appointment by nomination shall be made with effect from the 1st\nApril 1979 or thereafter in such phased mannere as would ensure that the total\nnumber of officers directly recruited in Maharashtra Development Service, Class I,\n\nshall not at any time after the 1st April 1982, be less than 35 per cent and more\nthan 50 per cent of the total number of posts in that cadre; or,\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n42 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n64. The Tribunal considered that instead of the existing one, the proviso shall be as\n\nsuggested and drafted by the Tribunal in paragraph 22 of its order dated 22.11.2002.\n\nThe text of proviso given by Tribunal is as hereinbelow.\n\n\" Provided that, appointment by nomination shall be made with\neffect form the 1st April, 1979 or there after in such phased\nmanner as would ensure that the total number of officers directly\n\nrecruited in Maharashtra Development Service, Class-I,shall not at\nany time after the 1st April, 1982, be less than35 percent of the\ntotal number of posts in that cadre, so however, that once the\n\nnumber of officers appointed by nomination reaches the level of 50\npercent on or before the 1st April, 1985 that level at 50 percent\n\nshall be maintained thereafter\"\n\n65. The Tribunal, therefore, went on to observe that on harmonious interpretation of\n\nrelevant material, it has to be said that the ratio prescribed is not flexible/variable, but\n\nonce minimum level transits to maximum level at 50 per cent the ratio between direct\n\nrecruits and promotees shall stand fixed at 50:50. The Tribunal has held, Administrative\n\nReforms Committee's recommendation no longer remains a mere recommendation. The\n\ngovernment having accepted that recommendation, it stands transformed into a\n\ngovernment decision.\n\n66. The Tribunal has referred to requisitions and appointments year-wise from 1984\n\nto 1989 in paragraph 16 of its order and had purportedly summed them up in a tabular\n\nform. The Tribunal, however, in the process has made a light work of the information\n\nand statistics submitted by the concerned respondents about there being no breach of\n\nquota rule and that there was no quota or vacant slot available within the quota of direct\n\nrecruits by saying that there were lot of accounting errors in identifying the permanent\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n43 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nposts and \"also the posts which have attributes of permanent posts\". The Tribunal\n\npresumed that unless there were slots available for direct recruits there could not have\n\nbeen requisitions to the MPSC for recommendation of the candidates and according to\n\nthe Tribunal, the respondents are estopped from contending that no slots were/are\n\navailable for the direct recruits within their quota and the stand taken by the\n\nrespondents, amounts to Government acting in an irresponsible manner. The Tribunal\n\nwent on to observe that no relevant record had been produced as had been required. In\n\nthe opinion of the Tribunal, the respondents were naive enough to believe that they can\n\nthrow dust in the eyes of the Tribunal by presenting unsustainable statistics.\n\n67. The Tribunal in paragraphs 24 to 30 of its order has discussed the case law cited\n\non either side and in paragraph 31 , purported to hold that that the quota rule having\n\nnot been maintained, there is continuing cause of action, though the final seniority list\n\nhad been published way back in 1996 and that though quota rule has reflection on\n\nseniority, it is also an independent and substantive subject in itself and, therefore, bar of\n\nlimitation under\nSection 21\nof the Administrative Tribunals Act cannot be attracted. The\n\nTribunal, however, further stated that \" The text of the promotion order cries out loudly\n\nand clearly that it was issued in an ugly and unholy haste. No magnifying glass is needed\n\nto discern this \" .\n\nIt would be appropriate to refer to the textual contents of paragraphs no. 32 and 33\n\nof the order dated 22.11.2002 passed by the Tribunal.\n\n\"32 . In the forestalled circumstances the original Application no. 256 /2000 has to\nsucceed. In point of fact, this case is on all fours with V. P. Shrivasava Vs. State of\nM.P.(AIR-1996-SCW-946). The respondent no.2 will, therefore, have to be directed\nto prepare fresh seniority lists strictly following the quota rule and by giving\nappropriate fitment both to the direct recruits and promotees within their respective\nquota. Such seniority lists will have to be prepared for each of the year during which\nappointment by nomination were made, as on the 1st January or 1st April of the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n44 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nrespective year as the practice may be. Such an exercise, including meticulous\nidentification of all the posts having the attributes of permanent posts, will have to be\n\ncarried out and completed within a given time frame of six months from receipt of a\ncopy of this order. We direct the respondent no.2 accordingly. Till such fresh\nseniority list/lists are prepared the existing seniority lists shall be continue to be\n\nmerely working seniority lists and the benefits flowing thereform, if any, shall\nremain fortuitous.\n\n33. Once Original Application No. 256/2000 is decided in favour of the petitioners,\nit is inconsequential and immaterial, whether the promotee officers had indeed been\n\npushed ahead. The strict implementation of the quota rule will take in its stride\ncorrective action to set right such distortions if any. If they were not within their quot\nthey will be pushed down. We have, however to observe that both the proposals were\nin the pipeline around the same time. We had required the respondent no.2 to\nproduce the original record. However, the original record relating to promotion of\n\npromotee officers from MDS Class-II to MDS Class-I has not been produced in spite of\nrepeated opportunities. An inference is, therefore, inescapable that there must be\n\nsubstance in the allegation. The text of the promotion order itself cries out loudly and\nclearly that it was issued in any ugly and unholy baste. No magnifying glass is\nneeded to discern this. Ten Officers were promoted by the said order. The sentence\nbelow the order states that the detailed posting orders in respect of the rest of the\n\nofficers other than Bagate and Shinde will be issued separately. The next sentence\nstates that the detailed positing orders in respect of of Bagate and Shinde will be\nissued separately. If the detailed posting orders in respect of all the ten officers were\nto follow what was the pressing urgency in issuing promotion orders without postings\nhas only to be imagined. We, have however, refrained from adjudicating this\n\nposition. The said petition has stood rendered infructuous. \"\n\nIt appears that Writ Petition No.2178 of 2003 filed by the State Government for quashing\n\nand setting aside the order of the Tribunal dated 22.11.2002 has been disposed of on\n\n17.1.2012 on the statement made on behalf of the State Government that it would\n\nmaintain 50 per cent quota each of direct recruits and promotees.\n\n68. Learned Counsel appearing on either side advancing cause of promotees and of\n\ndirect recruits have tried to buttress their submissions on the basis of various citations\n\nreferred to and relied on by them.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n45 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n69. Mr. Anturkar and other learned Counsel supporting him on behalf of the petitioners\n\nhave referred to and relied on following citations.\n\n70. The first citation relied on by the Petitioners is V.B. Badami vs. State of Mysore\n\nAIR 1980 SC 1561, which was a case in respect of Karnataka Administrative Service\n\n(Recruitment) Rules 1957. Referring to said case, it is submitted that the Supreme Court\n\nhas ruled that while working out quota rule between direct recruits and promotees, the\n\ngeneral principles followed are where rules prescribe quota between direct recruits and\n\npromotees, confirmation or substantive appointment can only be in respect of clear\n\nvacancies in the permanent strength of the cadre. Secondly, confirmed persons are to be\n\nsenior to those who are officiating and thirdly, as between persons appointed in\n\nofficiating capacity, seniority is to be counted on the length of continuous service and\n\nfourthly, direct recruitment is possible only by competitive examination which is the\n\nprescribed procedure under the rules. It has further been ruled by the Supreme Court\n\nthat there cannot be exchange of posts under the quota rules between direct recruits and\n\npromotees and vice versa.\n\n71. The other citation is the case of\nSonal Shimappa vs. State of Karnataka\n& ors.,\n\n1987 DGLS (Soft) 960 = 1987 AIR (SC) 2359 wherein the case of V.B. Badami\n\nreferred to above\nhas been followed.\n\n72. Petitioners further relied on A.R. Sircar vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, 1992 DGLS\n\n(Soft) 437=1993 (Supp.2) SCC 734, to support their case on de-facto doctrine. It has\n\nbeen held that the de-facto doctrine requires that, evenwhere an an act is declared ultra\n\nvires but prior to such declaration some act or decision was taken bonafide in accordance\n\nwith the rules and provisions of the Act, such decision taken would be saved by de-facto\n\ndoctrine. The Supreme Court was dealing with the U.P. State College Medical Teachers\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n46 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nService Rules framed under Gandhi Memorial and Associated Hospital (Taking Over) Act,\n\n1983. According to the petitioners, in the present case, factual situation is somewhat\n\nsimilar, as it has to be considered that the State Government had prepared a provisional\n\nlist in 1995 wherein they were shown to be senior to the concerned respondents and\n\nfinal seniority list had been issued in 1996 wherein also the petitioners were senior to\n\nthe concerned respondents and, therefore, contended that subsequent disturbance by the\n\nTribunal should not affect the bonafide decision taken by the State Government having\n\nregard to the de-facto doctrine.\n\n73.\nIn\nRana R. Singh vs. State of UP\n, 1989 SC 218= 1989 SCC Supp.1 615, again\n\nthe issue was regarding seniority as between the direct recruits and promotees governed\n\nby Uttar Pradesh Police Service Rules, 1942 framed under\nSection 241\nof the Government\n\nof India Act, 1935. The Supreme Court had refrained from passing an order which would\n\nhave resulted in re-opening the question of seniority causing serious prejudice to many\n\nofficers and since many officers had obtained further promotions and few were retired\n\nand some officers were not before the court. Therefore, without disturbing the situation,\n\nit was directed that a seniority be refixed on the basis of the Rules from 1981 onwards\n\nand quota rule be applied.\n\n74. A Constitution Bench of the Apex Court, in\nDirect Recruit Class II Engineering\n\nOfficers Association vs. State of Maharashtra\n, reported in 1990 AIR\n\n(SC)-0-1607=1990 SCC (2) 715, was once again dealing with rivalry for seniority in\n\nservice between the direct recruits and the promotees. It would be appropriate to\n\nreproduce here paragraphs 11 and 13 of said judgment:-\n\n11. Although the claim of the promotees to reckon the seniority according to the\ncontinuous officiation was accepted by this Court in Patwardhan's case in 1977,\nthe State Government continued denying them the fruits of the litigation. The\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n47 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nHigh Court on a complaint made by Bagayat Patil, took note of the delay and\nissued directions for implementation of the judgment. Still nothing was done till\n\n1984 and an application for starting proceedings in contempt was made before\nthe High Court. In the meantime a fresh writ petition being W.P. No. 660 of 1984\nwas filed by the direct recruits before the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay\n\nHigh Court and stay was obtained. Thereafter a number of similar applications\nwere filed one after another, either before the Nagpur Bench or the Aurangabad\nBench of the Bombay High Court. When the promotees pointed out before this\nCourt the game of the direct recruits, a direction was issued for hearing of all the\ncases at Bombay. Accordingly, all the 15 writ applications were transferred and\n\nheard together at Bombay. The High Court rejected the case of the direct recruits\nand dismissed the writ petitions. The petitioners in 9 of them have challenged the\njudgment in Civil Appeals No. 194-202 of 1986.\n\n13. When the cases were taken up for hearing before us, it was faintly suggested\n\nthat the principle laid down in Patwardhan's case (AIR 1977 SC 2051) was\nunsound and fit to be over-ruled, but no attempt was made to substantiate the\nplea. We were taken through the judgment by the learned counsel for the parties\n\nmore than once and we are in complete agreement with the ratio decidendi,\nthat the period of continuous officiation by a government servant, after his\nappointment by following the rules applicable for substantive appointments, has\n\nto be taken into account for determining his seniority; and seniority cannot be\ndetermined on the sole test of confirmation, for, as was pointed out,\nconfirmation is one of the inglorious uncertainties of government services\ndepending neither on efficiency of the incumbent nor on the availability of\nsubstantive vacancies. The principle for deciding inter se seniority has to conform\n\nto principles of equality spelt out by Arts. 14 and 16. If an appointment is made\nby way of stop-gap arrangement, without considering the claims of all the\neligible available persons and without following the rules of appointment, the\n\nexperience on such appointment cannot be equated with the experience of a\nregular appointee, because of the qualitative difference in the appointment. To\nequate the two would be to treat two unequals as equal which would violate the\nequality clause. But if the appointment is made after considering the claims of\n\nall eligible candidates and the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till\nthe regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules made for regular\nsubstantive appointments, there is no reason to exclude the officiating service for\npurpose of seniority. Same will be the position if the initial appointment itself is\nmade in accordance with the rules applicable to substantive appointments as in\nthe present case. To hold otherwise will be discriminatory and arbitrary.\nThis\n\nprinciple has been followed in innumerable cases and has been further\nelaborated by this Court in several judgments including those in\nBaleshwar Dass\nv. State of U.P. and others\n, [1981] 1 SCR 449 (AIR 1981 SC 41), and Delhi Water\nSupply and Sewage Disposal Committee and others v. R.K. Kashyap and others,\n(1989) Supp. 1 SCC 194 (AIR 1989 SC 278), with which we are in agreement.\n\nIn\n\nNarender Chadha and others v. Union of India and others\n, (1986) 1 SCR 211\n(AIR 1986 SC 638), the officers were promoted although without following the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n48 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nprocedure prescribed under the rules, but they continuously worked for long\nperiods of nearly 15-20 years on the posts without being reverted. The period of\n\ntheir continuous officiation was directed to be counted for seniority as it was\nheld that any other view would be arbitrary and violative of\nArticles 14\nand\n16.\n\nThere is considerable force in this view also. We, therefore, confirm the\n\nprinciple of counting towards seniority the period of continuous officiation\nfollowing an appointment made in accordance with the rules prescribed for\nregular substantive appointments in the service.\n\nThe Supreme Court has summed up and held in paragraph 44 as under:-\n\n\"44. To sum up, we hold that:\n\n(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority\nhas to be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the\n\ndate of his confirmation. The corollary of the above rule is that where the initial\nappointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stop-gap\narrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for\n\nconsidering the seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure\nlaid down\n\nby\nthe rules but the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the\nregularisation of his service in accordance with the rules, the period of officiating\nservice will be counted.\n\n(C) When appointments are made from more than one source, it is permissible\n\nto fix the ratio for recruitment from the different sources, and if rules are framed\nin this regard they must ordinarily be followed strictly.\n\n(D) If it becomes impossible to adhere to the existing quota rule, it should be\nsubstituted by an appropriate rule to meet the needs of the situation. In case,\nhowever, the quota rule is not followed continuously for a number of years\nbecause it was impossible to do so the inference is irresistible that the quota rule\n\nhad broken down.\n\n(E) Where the quota rule has broken down and the appointments are made from\none source in excess of the quota, but are made after following the procedure\nprescribed by the rules for the appointment, the appointees should not be\npushed down below the appointees from the other source inducted in the\n\nservice at a later date.\n\n(F) Where the rules permit the authorities to relax the provisions relating to the\nquota, ordinarily a presumption should be raised that there was such relaxation\nwhen there is a deviation from the quota rule.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n49 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n(G) The quota for recruitment from the different sources may be prescribed by\nexecutive instructions, if the rules are silent on the subject.\n\n(H) If the quota rule is prescribed by an executive instruction, and is not\nfollowed continuously for a number of years, the inference is that the executive\n\ninstruction has ceased to remain operative.\n\n(I) The posts held by the permanent Deputy Engineers as well as the officiating\nDeputy Engineers under the State of Maharashtra belonged to the single cadre\nof Deputy Engineers.\n\n(J) The decision dealing with important questions concerning a particular service\ngiven after careful consideration should be respected rather than scrutinised for\nfinding out any possible error. It is not in the interest of Service to unsettle a\nsettled position. With respect to Writ Petition No. 1327 of 1982, we further hold:\n\n(K) That a dispute raised by an application under\nArt. 32\nof the Constitution must\n\nbe held to be barred by principles of res judicata including the rule of\nconstructive res judicata if the same has been earlier decided by a competent court\nby a judgment which became final.\n\nIn view of the above and the other findings recorded earlier, we do not find\nany merit in any of the civil appeals, writ petitions and special leave petitions\nwhich are accordingly dismissed. There will be, however, no order as to costs.\nOrder accordingly.\n\n75. The petitioners have also relied on\nKeshav Chandra Joshi vs. Union of India\n,\n\n1990 DGLS (Soft) 638 = 1991 AIR (SC) 284, wherein it has been held that officiation\n\nby adhoc appointee would not be considered for computing seniority if the same is not\n\naccording to the rules.\n\n76. Same principle has been reiterated in\nState of West Bengal vs. Aghore Nath Dey\n,\n\n1993 DGLS (Soft) 324 = 1993 (3) SCC 371, that adhoc services cannot be upheld if\n\nsame are in violation of rules.\n\n77. Similar ratio has been\nlaid down in\n\nState of Uttar Pradesh v. R.K. Tandon\nDGLS (Soft) 1096 = 1996 AIR (SC) 3505, so also in\nDinkar Anna Patil vs. State\nof\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n50 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nMaharashtra, 1999 AIR (SC) 152 =1999 SCC (1) 354, wherein in paragraph 20, it has\n\nbeen observed thus :\n\n\"20. The Tribunal upheld the contention raised on behalf of the Government of\n\nMaharashtra and the private respondents that the action of the appellants in\nchallenging the seniority lists was belated one and the same deserved no\nconsideration. This finding of the Tribunal, in our considered view, cannot be\nsustained. The seniority list prepared as on Ist April 1987 could not have been\n\nchallenged by the appellants because at that point of time, they were not born in\nthe cadre. But, however, the subsequent provisional list as on Ist January, 1991\nwhich was published on 20th January, 1992, the appellants did make their\nrepresentation against the same on 23rd September, 1992. Along with the said\nrepresentation, they also annexed a copy of the judgment dated 2nd January,\n1992 rendered by the Tribunal giving certain directions in respect of seniority list\n\nof Sales Tax Inspectors to be recast strictly in accordance with the quota rule as\nprovided under the Sales Tax Inspectors Recruitment Rules. These Rules are\n\nsimilar to the Rules in question. The said representation was rejected and the list\nwas finalised on Ist February, 1993. The third provisional seniority list as on Ist\nJanuary, 1992 of Sales Tax Officers Class-I was published on 26th January, 1993\nwherein quota rule was applied and the direct recruits of 1988 batch were placed\n\nabove some 22 promotees who were shown in the earlier seniority list as senior to\nthem. However, while preparing the final seniority list dated 29th December,\n1993, the position as reflected in 1991 seniority list was again restored giving\nbenefit of fortuitous service to the promotees and consequently, the appellants\nwere shown below these promotees; The appellants did file their representation\n\nagainst the said seniority list on 30th March, 99 but, there was no response one\nway or the other from the Government of Maharashtra. Again, another provisional\n\nseniority list as on 1st January, 1993 was published on 13th June, 1994 and the\nsaid list was again prepared in violation of quota rule. It is true that the appellants\ndid not file any representation against; this provisional seniority list because it was\nnot in any way different than the one prepared on 29th December, 1993. Since,\nthere was no purpose in filing further representation, the appellants approached\n\nthe Tribunal for appropriate reliefs. Having regard to this background, we are of\nthe firm opinion that the original petition of appellants could not have been\nbranded as suffering from latches. The appellants did approach the Government of\nMaharashtra as well as the Tribunal vindicating their grievance as regards their\nplacements in the seniority lists.\n\n78. The petitioners have relied on yet another decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nKeshav Chandra Joshi vs. Union of India\n, AIR 1991 SC 284=1992 SCC (Supp.1) 272,\n\ndealing with U. P. Forest Service Rules, 1952, giving rise to the dispute\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n51 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nregarding inter-se seniority between promotees and direct recruits. In paragraph 24 of the\n\njudgment, a reference has been made to the case of Direct Recruits' reported in 1990\n\n(2) SCC 715 = AIR 1990 SC 1607, wherein it was held :\n\n\"(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his seniority has\n\nto be counted from the date of his appointment and not according to the date of\nhis confirmation. The corollary of the above rule is that where the initial\nappointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as stop gap\narrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for\nconsidering the seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure\nlaid down by\n\nthe rules but the appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly till the\nregularization of his service in accordance with the rules, the period of officiating\n\nservice will be counted.\"\n\n79. To support their contention, the petitioners have also relied on the case of\nA.N.\n\nSehgal vs. Raje Ram Sheoran\n, 1991 AIR (SC) 1406 = 1992 SCC (Supp.1) 304.\n\n80. On behalf of Respondents-direct recruits, Mr. Ajay Deshpande, learned Counsel\n\nhas categorized the citations relied on by him in support of his submissions in three parts,\n\nviz. (i) limitation, (ii) consideration of temporary posts for application of quota rules and\n\n(iii) promotions not as per rules not to be taken into account for the purpose of seniority.\n\nOn limitation, he has referred to only one case\nM. Ramkotaiah and\n\nothers vs. Union of India\n, 2007 AIR SCW 2204. In this case, the Supreme Court has\n\nruled that regular appointment is relevant for computation of seniority and that on\n\npublication of new and valid seniority list, the old list stands superseded. Though the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n52 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\ncitation is relied on for the purpose of \"limitation\", the case does not exactly deal with\n\nlimitation. It appears to be the contention of the learned Counsel that it is\n\nimplicit since it has been considered in the same that until publication of a new and\n\nvalid seniority list, the old seniority list does not cease to operate. In the present case,\n\nseniority list has been finalized on 1.7.1996 and it is sought to be disputed long\n\nthereafter in 1999 and subsequently in original application. We do not think it\n\nappropriate to deal with the issue of limitation for it has been rendered of little\n\nsignificance in the present case.\n\n81.\n\nIn the citation A.K. Subraman & ors. vs. Union of India and ors.\n\nReported in AIR 1975 SC 483, on the second point of \"consideration of temporary post\n\nfor applying quota rule\", ratio appears to be that in the cases of appointments in\n\naccordance with rules, seniority of such appointees in service will be from the date of\n\ntheir initial officiating appointment, provided the same is within their quota and that the\n\nquota rule would be enforced at the time of initial recruitment in officiating capacity\n\nand would be applicable irrespective of permanent or temporary post. The ratio\nlaid\n\ndown by\nthe Supreme Court is in respect of Central Engineering Service Class I\n\nRecruitment Rules, 1954 which did not confine to promotee vacancies and/or specific\n\nnumber of posts. Similar does not appear to be the position in the present case which is\n\ngoverned MDS Rules.\n\n82. Another case relied on by learned Counsel for the respondents-applicants is\nD.\n\nGanesh Rao Patnaik and others vs. State of Jharkhand and others\n, 2005 AIR SCW\n\n5199, wherein the Apex Court has considered provisions of Bihar Superior Judicial\n\nService Rules 1946, and particularly rule 6 thereof. The Supreme Court has ruled that\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n53 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nsince the 'cadre' does not exclude consideration of temporary post, it would mean entire\n\ncadre without exclusion of temporary posts and in such a case, temporary and permanent\n\nposts would be taken into account and a promotee filling a post of direct recruit would\n\nnot be able to claim seniority over the direct recruit.\n\n83.\nIn\nFood\nCorporation of India vs. Thaneswar Kalita and others\n, 1995 AIR\n\nSCW 4659, the judgment proceeds on admitted position that the respondents were\n\nappointed on ad-hoc basis dehors the rules and, as such, it was considered that their\n\ncontinuance for a long time in promotional post would not be amenable to computation\n\nof seniority. The Supreme Court has disagreed with the directions of the High Court to\n\ntreat entire service of the respondents therein to be on regular basis.\n\n84. In yet another case, State of Maharashtra and anr. vs. Sanjay Thakre and\n\nors. reported in 1995 Supp (2) SCC 407\n, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal filed\n\nby the State as well as the promotees which dealt with the similar situation as in the\n\nprevious citation and the Supreme Court ruled that any ad-hoc appointment or\n\npromotion dehors the rules would not be taken into account for computation of\n\nseniority. The Supreme Court observed, \"The State having made the rules, should\n\nimplement them in letter and spirit; any justification for dereliction in implementation\n\nshould not be countenanced; it should really be snubbed\".\n\n85. The next citation relied on by the respondents is\nM.S.L. Patil vs. State of\n\nMaharashtra\n, (1996) 11 SCC 361 which holds the same way as earlier citation that the\n\npersons promoted in excess of their quota are not entitled to count their length of service\n\nas promotees for the purpose of seniority and the same would be counted from the date\n\nof availability of their quota. These observations were with reference to the\n\nMaharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982. The Supreme Court\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n54 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nfurther stated that the general principle of law\nlaid down by\nit is applicable to every\n\nperson including those who were not a party to that order.\n\n86. The other citation\nMadan Gopal Garg vs. State of Punjab and ors\n, 1996 AIR\n\nSCW 603, is in respect of Pubjab Good & Supplies Department (State Service Class II)\n\nRules 1966. The Supreme Court while dealing with the promotion of the appellant from\n\nthe post of Deputy Director to Controller involving 'inter se' seniority between direct\n\nrecruit and promotee and held that a promotee cannot be given seniority over direct\n\nrecruit on the basis only of his prior appointment.\n\n87.\n\nIn\nMaharashtra Vikrikar Karmachari Sangathana v. State of Maharashtra\n\nand anr. 2000 AIR SCW 138, the seniority list as confirmed under the order of the court\n\npursuant to litigation before the Tribunal, had been held to have been barred by\n\nconstructive res-judicata and list of seniority prepared in violation of quota rule had not\n\nbeen approved irrespective of promotees remaining in office for seventeen years,\n\nignoring date of selection of the appellant. Ratio has been with reference to\n\nMaharashtra Sales Tax Inspectors Recruitment Rules, 1971, finding that the State of\n\nMaharashtra had taken a definite stand that promotions in excess of quota were\n\ntemporary, ad hoc and as a stop gap arrangement without reckoning the period of\n\nofficiation by promotees for the purpose of fixing seniority.\n\n88. The next citation relied on by respondents-applicants is\nR.K. Mobisana Singh vs.\n\nKh. Temba Singh\nand ors. 2008 AIR SCW 127 which lays down that retrospective\n\nregularization of ad-hoc appointees would confer other benefits to them, but same cannot\n\nbe of any assistance in reckoning seniority with retrospective effect and on facts, it was\n\nheld that since in some cases relevant procedure was not followed, question of their\n\nacquiring seniority over direct recruits does not arise.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:16 :::\n\n55 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n89.\nIn yet another case, High Court of Judicature for\nRajasthan vs. Veena Verma\n\nand anr. 2009 AIR SCW 4685, the Supreme Court was dealing with altogether different\n\nset of facts. In the cited case, a mandate was sought which according to the original\n\npetitioner, was as per rules. The petitioner being 8th in the selected candidates and\n\naccording to her as per rules vacancies for direct recruits being 10 and not 7, a mandate\n\nwas sought for new appointment. Learned Single Judge had dismissed the writ petition,\n\nbut the Division Bench had set aside the learned Single Judge's said order and directed\n\nthe High Court to determine the number of vacancies and if the vacancies were more\n\nthan seven, then consider petitioner Veena Verma for the post in Rajasthan Higher\n\nJudicial Service. The Supreme Court set aside the order of the Division Bench of\n\nRajasthan High Court and restored the one passed by the learned Single Judge.\n\n90. We quite see that in the present controversy, the MDS Rules, 1973 shall be at the\n\ncore and would play a pivotal role for decision in the matter. From the MDS Rules,1973\n\nand amendments thereto from time to time as have been placed on record, it emerges\n\nthat the nomination channel for appointment to MDS Class-I cadre had been introduced\n\nby amendments to the rule. It would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant rules\n\nherein below:\n\nTHE MAHARASHTRA DEVELOPMENT SERVICE (CONSTITUTION,\nCLASSIFICATION AND RECRUITMENT) RULES, 1973\n\nRule 3.

It cannot be ignored that MDS class I cadre is a creature of MDS Rules, 1973 and\n\nthe rules create specific number of MDS Class I cadre posts under sub rule 4 of Rule 3\n\nand Rule 5 provides for recruitment to the same by nomination and promotion and also\n\nprovides for interse proportion thereof and mechanism to bring about change in number\n\nof posts is referred to under sub rule 6 of Rule 3.\n\n92. While it is nobody's case that there had occurred change to number of MDS Class I\n\nposts contained in the MDS Rules, 1973, it is also not the case of rival parties that the\n\nState Government by order in official Gazette has altered the number of MDS Class-I\n\nposts.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n65 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n93. The stand of the State Government in matter that quota of direct recruits being\n\nfulfilled cannot be lightly discarded and carries lot of credibility. Upon perusal of of rule\n\nthat MDS Class-l comprised of 106 posts and with induction of applicants' batch of 40 the\n\nquota of direct recruits had been fulfilled. The applicants could not repel this position by\n\nconvincingly dealing with the same with facts and figures though they tried to wrangle\n\nover it contending that the posts of project, programme, planning, regional nutrition,\n\nchild development officers form part of MDS Class-I cadre and contending that cadre\n\nconsists of much larger number. However, it will have to be observed that said contention\n\nis devoid of substance as said posts were never included MDS Class-l cadre by adopting\n\nthe process referred to in sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of MDS Rules, 1973 nor those were\n\nconsidered to form part of the same by the State Government at any point of time. Said\n\nposts cannot be said to acquire that status under prolonged continuance unless and until\n\nthe same is recognized and conferred by employing mechanism provided for bringing\n\nabout the same as stipulated in the MDS Rules, 1973. Inclusion of said posts in MDS\n\nClass-l cadre is possible only through the mode of notification by the State Government in\n\nthe official gazette not otherwise. The State Government has never accepted said posts as\n\nMDS Class-l cadre posts and have in no uncertain terms denied such claims time and\n\nagain, repeatedly, in pleadings and on affidavits before the Tribunal and even by\n\nchallenging the orders of Tribunal wherein directions are issued to consider those as such\n\nfor quota and seniority. It has also to be considered that attributes of permanency of said\n\nposts or acquisition of permanent status by itself would not clothe the posts with the\n\nstatus of MDS Class-l cadre and would not be of any significance for birth in the said\n\ncadre and does not at all cause conversion to MDS Class-l cadre.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n66 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n94. Perusal of the judgment and order of the Tribunal would reveal that the directions\n\nas given by the Tribunal are in total conflict with the rules governing the field. The\n\nTribunal by the impugned order has purported to 're-enact' the rules under the garb of\n\nplacing interpretation which, in our considered view, is not permissible in law.\n\n95. The Government had very specifically stated that the ratio of direct recruits had\n\nbeen as per the quota rules and further that proportion of appointments of direct recruits\n\nhas been in excess till 1990 specifically referring to figures of posts available in cadre\n\nand number of direct recruits in the same. Though applicants have tried to dispute the\n\nsame, the situation cannot be ignored that there has been no increase or decrease in\n\nnumber of MDS Class-I cadre posts when the applicants were appointed. The applicants\n\nwant to consider other posts to form MDS Class-l cadre which under law is not possible,\n\nwithout following the procedure contained in the MDS Rules, 1973.\n\n96. There has been no declaration about there being any alteration, increasing or\n\nreducing number of MDS class-l cadre posts, as required under sub-rule 6 of Rule 3 of\n\nMDS Rules, 1973. Said MDS Rules of 1973 underwent various amendments from time\n\nto time, without alteration of the number of MDS Class-I cadre posts. The number of\n\nMDS Class-l cadre posts has not been touched by the amendments which have been\n\nplaced on record by the authorities. Said position has not been disputed by applicants.\n\nThe posts which the Tribunal has referred to as having attributes of permanency appear\n\nto be from pools out side MDS Class-I cadre. It appears that the creation of said posts had\n\nbeen with a specific purpose for implementation of schemes/programmes/projects under\n\ndirections and orders of the Central/State Governments.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n67 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n97. There had been no amalgamation of said posts with those in the MDS Class-I cadre\n\nat any point of time by following the procedure as prescribed and required under sub-\n\nrule 6 of rule 3 of MDS Rules of 1973. In absence of any such action by the Government\n\nfor amendment or alteration to number of posts under the rules by amalgamation, the\n\ndirections given by the Tribunal rewriting the rules are grossly ill-conceived. So long as\n\nthe procedure for increase or decrease in number of Class-I cadre posts is not followed by\n\nState, such directions by the Tribunal would not be tenable.\n\n98. Government Decision dated 07-03-1996 pressed into service by applicants has little\n\nefficacy in the present controversy and hardly has any application to the situation. The\n\nGovernment decision has been issued for application and maintenance of quota system\n\nwhere there are no rules, governing recruitments in government services. Perusal of the\n\nsame would show that the stipulations thereunder would hold good wherever there are\n\nno provisions for quota system in the rules. Further, it provides for regular revisions and\n\nthe conversion of temporary posts over three years into permanent, with the concurrence\n\nof finance department with view to facilitate maintaining proportion of quota. It also\n\nmakes clear that the said Government decision would be applicable prospectively from\n\n01-04-1996. In the present matter, no case has even been pleaded about conversion of\n\nposts, into permanent ones, taking place with the concurrence of finance department. It\n\nhas also to be taken into account that application of said Government decision to the\n\nposts which the applicants want to be considered to be of MDS Class-I cadre has not been\n\naccepted by the respondent authorities. Having regard to aforesaid, it will have to be\n\nconsidered that Government Resolution hardly has any significance in present\n\ncontroversy and that apart the same would not cover the period before\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n68 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n01-04-1996. As such, the directions with reference to the same issued by Tribunal in\n\nrespect of period prior to 1996 would not be sustainable. The Tribunal has not dealt with\n\nsaid aspect of Government Resolution and altogether disregarded that it was operative\n\nfrom 01-04-1996.\n\n99. It appears that without there being concrete material on record the Tribunal has\n\ninferred that there are lot of accounting errors in identifying permanent posts and that\n\nthe respondents have proved that there were adequate slots available for direct recruits.\n\n100. The position that clearly emerges is that pursuant to the rules and the position as\n\nstated in the affidavits in reply, the number of posts in MDS Class I cadre were 95 in\n\n1988-89 comprising 54 permanent and 44 temporarily sanctioned. With the\n\nappointment of batch of 40 persons including the respondents-applicants, in 1990,\n\nposition was that 71 posts were occupied and held by direct recruits. In fact, the\n\nauthority had categorically submitted with figures indicating as stated by the\n\nrespondents, the quota of appointments of the direct recruits had been fulfilled. The\n\nrespondents-applicants had in clear terms expressed their inability to furnish\n\nproper/exact figures of the posts available for direct recruits in MDS Class I cadre. They\n\nwere not in a position to discard the submission that the posts viz. Project Director\n\n(DRDA), Programme Officer, DPAP, Planning Officer, Regional Nutrition Officers and\n\nChild Development Officers which they have contended to form part of MDS Class I\n\ncadre, were not included in MDS Class I cadre or for that matter, there has been any\n\ngovernment resolution in that respect. The respondents-applicants want that these posts\n\nshould be deemed to be included in MDS Class I cadre in the absence of any notification\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n69 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nwhich, according to them, have attributes of permanent posts pursuant to the order of the\n\nTribunal dated 22.11.2002\n\n101. In our considered view, the Tribunal has been in error in putting in a long arm,\n\nespecially in the absence of any concrete material before it. The authorities which have\n\nbeen relied on by the respondents-applicants are of little help to them, having regard to\n\nthe fact that the situation is occupied and governed by specific rules holding the field\n\nof operation and the respondents-applicants have to abide by the same from\n\ninception with their appointments. Quota rules and absence of observance of the same\n\nhave been much harped about. However, the respondents-applicants have not been able\n\nto show as to how quota rule has not been followed, especially when they are not in a\n\nposition to say that the posts which they want to be part of MDS Class I cadre had ever\n\nbeen amalgamated with MDS Class-I cadre by a notification under a government gazette\n\nas required by sub-rule 6 of Rule 3 of MDS Rules, 1973. The decision rendered by the\n\nTribunal is on hypothetical basis, without any concrete material in support thereof, is\n\nbased on assumptions and presumptions and surmises and conjectures. In our view, the\n\nTribunal has grossly misdirected itself in allowing the Original Applications.\n\n102. It is incomprehensible that the Tribunal assumes role of legislature and purports\n\nto legislate which the rules did not intend. There is no room for 'casus omissus' as the\n\nintention under the rules has been clear and unambiguous, to have variable ratio in\n\nappointments of direct recruits viz; 35 to 50 per cent.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n70 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n103. It is obvious that so long as there is no addition or reduction to MDS Class I posts\n\nreferred to under sub rule (4) of Rule 3 of other posts over and above said MDS Class I\n\ncadre posts, such posts would not automatically form part of that cadre. It is apparent\n\nthat unless and until the posts which the applicants wanted to form part of MDS cadre\n\nare actually included in that cadre by increasing number of posts of MDS Class I cadre by\n\nfollowing procedure under sub-rule (6), the contention of the applicants would not hold\n\nwater and would not be justified. There has been serious and gross error in rendering\n\ndecision and issuing directions without reference to sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 and in being\n\noblivious about the existence of the same. The discussion by the Tribunal, therefore, has\n\nto be considered as strayed one. Perusal of impugned order indicates that the Tribunal\n\nhas practically rewritten the rules. The other considerations which have weighed with\n\nthe Tribunal have little relevance so far as posts in MDS Class I cadre are concerned.\n\n104. Perusal of sub-rule (6) of rule 3 would reveal that the State Government has been\n\nempowered either to increase or decrease the number of posts or to designate or include\n\nmore categories of posts or exclude any category of post in the cadre. However, it is\n\nnobody's case that by exercise of such power vested in it, the State Government has, at\n\nany point of time, increased the number of posts in MDS Class-I cadre. It is, thus, clear\n\nthat the directions given by the learned Tribunal are totally contrary to the statutory rules.\n\n105. The Tribunal has been absolutely in error in placing an interpretation on the\n\nproviso to rule 5 the way in which it has been placed in the judgment and order on\n\n22.11.2002. The same amounts to virtually rewriting text of the rule, particularly in\n\nabsence of such intent reflected, submitted or advanced. Expansion of dispute beyond\n\nthe scope of MDS Rules, 1973 is grossly misplaced. Wording in proviso to rule 5 does\n\nnot in any way suggest or give allowance to interpretation as has been placed and in the\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n71 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nprocess, proviso had been re-written by the Tribunal. The proviso to rule 5 of MDS\n\nRules, 1973 on reading, plainly reveals that intention under the same is to have flexibility\n\nin the appointments to MDS Class-I cadre, taking pragmatic view of the situations those\n\narise in making appointments. However, at the same time, the range within which\n\nflexibility is available has been specifically provided for. Having regard to this, it appears\n\nthat the Tribunal has been influenced by considerations which are extraneous to the\n\nMDS Rules, 1973.\n\n106. Posts which the Tribunal required the Government to consider having attributes\n\nof permanency and to be reckoned for MDS Class-I cadre, is without taking into account\n\nthe provisions of the statutory rules. The Tribunal's directions and orders in such a\n\nscenario would be wholly misconceived.\n\n107. The force of contention of the applicants that the appointments of the petitioners\n\nherein have been by way of stop gap arrangement and have not been regularized is\n\nwatered down as it can be borne out from the applicants' pleading that the respondents'\n\npromotion have approval of Departmental Promotion Committee which is the proper\n\nchannel. There appears to be no dispute about such assertions of the respondent-\n\nauthorities. It would further be required to be taken into consideration that it has\n\nemerged that there is no change in the number of posts in Class I cadre under the MDS\n\nRules, 1973 and there appears to be no dispute about figure of appointments of direct\n\nrecruits in MDS cadre. As such, the appointments of promotees cannot be said to\n\nimpinge on the quota of direct recruits in MDS Class I cadre. Having regard to the\n\nposition that the quota rule has been followed and proper quota of direct\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n72 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\nrecruits finds place in the number of posts in MDS Class I cadre according to the rules,\n\nthe authorities referred to and relied upon on behalf of the applicants have little role in\n\nthe present controversy.\n\n108. When the field is governed and occupied by specific rules, as in present case like\n\nMDS Rules 1973 which have been clear and unambiguous, there had been no room to\n\nplace an interpretation on the same than its plain words. The Tribunal as such has erred\n\nin going beyond the spirit and letter of the proviso to clause (a) of sub rule (1) of Rule 5.\n\n109. Though rival arguments have been advanced before us by petitioners so also by\n\nthe respondents that the original application was beyond limitation and per contra that it\n\nis within limitation, we do not find it necessary to go into that aspect of the matter. The\n\nlearned Tribunal after hearing the parties has decided the matter on merits. We have\n\nalso considered the matter on merits and, as such, it would not be appropriate at this\n\nstage to go into that issue.\n\n110. In our considered view, therefore, the Tribunal has wholly misconceived the\n\nscope of the matter before it had been in error all over. The impugned order cannot be\n\njustified with the aid of material on record. The Tribunal, thus, has erred in issuing\n\nimpugned directions to prepare fresh seniority list. Looking at the matter in any way,\n\nthe impugned order passed by the Tribunal dated 22-11-2002 and the one dated\n\n28-04-2004 are wholly unsustainable and deserve to be quashed and set aside and as its\n\nincident, the impugned seniority list would not be able to stand.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:19:17 :::\n\n73 JTWP-2466.05(2).doc\n\n111. Therefore, the order dated 22-11-2002 of the Tribunal and all other orders\n\nincluding the orders in contempt petition and in the review applications deserve to be\n\nquashed and set aside.\n\n112. In the result, writ petitions are allowed. The order dated 22.11.2002 passed by\n\nthe Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Aurangabad Bench, in Original Applications\n\nNo. 254 and 256 of 2000 and the subsequent orders dated 28.4.2004 and 21.2.2006 in\n\nContempt Petition No. 89 of 2003, so also order dated 3.11.2004 in Review Applications\n\nNo. 11 and 12 of 2004, are set aside. Consequently, seniority lists prepared by the\n\nDepartment of Rural Development and Water Conservation of the State Government\n\ndated 21.11.2005 in pursuance of the directions under the aforesaid orders of the\n\nTribunal, is also set aside.\n\n113. Rule made absolute in aforesaid terms without there being any order as to costs.\n\n114. In view disposal of writ petitions, civil applications are also disposed of.\n\n[ Sunil P.
