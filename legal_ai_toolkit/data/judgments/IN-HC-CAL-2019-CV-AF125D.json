No. 20936 (W) of 2014\n\nSwapan Kumar Sardar & Ors.\n-Versus-\nThe State of West Bengal & Ors.\n\nFor the petitioners: Mr. Sardar Amjad Ali, Sr. Advocate,\nMs. Sucharita Roy.\n\nFor the KMDA: Mr. Partha Sarathi Bose,\nMr. Satyajit Talukdar.\n\nFor the State: Mr. Tapan Kumar Mukherjee, ld.A.G.P.\nMr. Somnath Naskar.\n\nHeard on: November 18, 2019.\n\nJudgment on: November 18, 2019.\n\nRajasekhar Mantha, J.:\n\nThe principal challenge in the instant writ petition by the employees of\n\nthe Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (in short KMDA) is to an order\n\ndated 22nd January, 2014 passed by the KMDA pursuant to a direction of this\n\nCourt in W.P. No. 842 of 2011 (\nSwapan Kumar Sardar & Ors. - Vs. - The State of\n\nWest Bengal & Ors.\n).\n\nThe fact leading to the claims of the writ petitioners is that they were\n\noriginally granted a Career Advancement Scheme (CAS), for the purpose of\n\nimproving the administration and service benefits to the direct employees of the\nState Government and State controlled bodies. The said Career Advancement\n\nScheme was allowed in or about the year 1995 on the recommendation of the\n\nconcerned Pay Commission not only to the employees of the State Government\n\nbut also to employees of the statutory bodies under it.\n\nSubsequently, when the 4th Pay Commission was implemented in or\n\nabout the year 2002 an improved benefit of a Modified Career Advancement\n\nScheme (MCAS) was allowed exclusively to the State Government employees.\n\nIt is submitted by the Counsel for the State that although the Pay\n\nCommission was requested to consider the case of employees of statutory bodies\n\nunder the control of the State Government, the same was declined.\n\nBefore proceeding further with this order, it is necessary to explain the\n\ndifference between the original CAS and subsequently introduced MCAS. The\n\nbenefit under the original CAS was in the form of an automatic increment and/or\n\nclimbing on to the next pay scale available to those employees, who were\n\nstagnating in their existing pay scale could not otherwise progress in their careers\n\nin two intervals i.e. after the completion of ten years of service (first\n\nadvancement/jump to the next higher pay scale) and after completion of 20 years\n\n(second advancement).\n\nPursuant to the recommendation of the 4th Pay Commission, the same\n\nbenefit of career advancement (hereinafter called the Modified Career\n\nAdvancement Scheme) was given to the employees at three stages, i.e., after eight\n\nyears (first movement), after sixteen years (second advancement) and after twenty\none years (third advancement) of completion of their services. This was in\n\nreplacement of the original Career Advancement Scheme.\n\nIt will not be out of place to mention that both the CAS and MCAS were\n\nallowed based on the similar Schemes allowed to the Central Government\n\nemployees.\n\nThe arguments of the employees of KMDA are as follows:\n\n(a) There is discrimination on the part of the State in allowing the\n\nbenefits of the MCAS to the State Government employees while\n\ndenying the same to the employees of statutory bodies under the\n\nState;\n\n(b) A large number of other statutory bodies like Howrah Municipal\n\nCorporation, Shanti Niketan and Sriniketan Development Authority,\n\nHaldia Development Authority and West Bengal Pollution Control\n\nBoard etc., have been allowed such benefits. These two of such\n\norganizations are similarly situated as the KMDA and therefore there\n\nis a class between the class and or class legislation created by the\n\nState.\n\n(c) There is apparent contradictions and mindless fallacy in the\n\nimpugned order where the Principal Secretary, Urban Development\n\nDepartment, Government of West Bengal and the Principal Secretary,\n\nFinance Department, Government of West Bengal on one hand said\n\nthat they could not grant the MCAS to the KMDA employees in view of\n\nthe bar under the 4th Pay Commission but in the same breath\ncontended that if the funds of the KMDA permitted such benefits, the\n\nsame could be availed by the employees of KMDA.\n\nKMDA similar to the Haldia Development Authority and the Shanti\n\nNiketan and Sriniketan Development Authority are constituted and function\n\nunder the provisions of the \"\nWest Bengal Town and Country (Planning and\n\nDevelopment) Act, 1979\n\".\nSection 19\nof the said Act stipulates that the following\n\npersons shall comprise of the governing body of the KMDA -\n\n\"19. Composition of the 1[Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\nAuthority\n(1) The 1[Kolkata] Metropolitan Development Authority shall\nconsist of the following members:--\n\n(a) the Chief Minister of the State of West Bengal or any\nperson nominated by him shall be the Chairman, and a\nMinister of the State of West Bengal to be nominated by the\nChief Minister shall be the Vice-Chairman:\n\nProvided that when there is no Council of Ministers\nfunctioning in the State of West Bengal, the State\nGovernment shall nominate such persons, as it may think\nfit, to be the two members and the Chairman and Vice-\nChairman respectively of the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan\nDevelopment Authority;\n\n(b) the Chief Executive Officer of the 1[Kolkata] Metropolitan\nDevelopment Authority, ex officio;\n\n(c) not more than three officers of the rank of Secretary to the\nState Government to be nominated by the State Government;\nand 2\n\n(d) not more than five persons to be nominated by the State\nGovernment of whom--\n\n(i) two shall be Councillors or Aldermen of the 1[Kolkata]\nMunicipal Corporation;\n\n(ii) one shall be a Councillor or Alderman of the Howrah\nMunicipal Corporation;\n\n(iii) two shall be Commissioners of any municipality within\nthe 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Area:\n\nProvided that when an order of supersession of the 1\n[Kolkata] Municipal Corporation or the Howrah Municipal\nCorporation or the municipality, as the case may be, has\nbeen made and is in force, it shall be competent for the State\nGovernment to nominate, in place of the Councillors or\nAldermen or Commissioners, as the case may be, such\npersons as have experience in or knowledge of\nadministration of local self-government to be members of the\n1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development Authority:\n\nProvided further that on the revocation of the order of\nsupersession as aforesaid, the members nominated under\nthe first proviso shall, notwithstanding that the term of office\nof such members has not expired, cease to hold office and\nthe vacancies shall be filled up in accordance with the\nprovisions of clause (d).\n\n(2) The Vice-Chairman shall discharge such functions and\nexercise such powers as may be delegated to him by the\nChairman and shall, during the absence of the Chairman,\nperform the functions and exercise the powers of the\nChairman.\n\n(3) The members referred to in clause (d) of sub-section (1)\nshall hold office for a term of three years from the date of\ntheir nomination by the State Government and shall receive\nsuch allowances for attending the meetings of the 1 [Kolkata]\nMetropolitan Development Authority or any committee\nthereof, as may be prescribed: 3\n[Provided that every such member, on ceasing to be a\nCouncillor or Alderman of the 1 [Kolkata] Municipal\nCorporation or the Howrah Municipal Corporation or\nCommissioner of a municipality within the 1 [Kolkata]\nMetropolitan Area, as the case may be, shall,\nnotwithstanding that the term of office of such member has\nnot expired, cease to hold office and the vacancy shall be\nfilled up in accordance with the provisions of clause (d) of\nsub-section (1).]\n(4) No act or proceeding of the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan\nDevelopment Authority shall be deemed to be invalid merely\nby reason of any vacancy in, or defect, initial or subsequent,\nin the constitution of that Authority\"\n\nThe finance, accounts and audit of the KMDA are required to be governed\n\nby\nSections 107\nto\nof the aforesaid Act of 1979.\nSection 107\n,\n&\nstipulates as follows:\n\n\"107. (1) Every Planning Authority or Development Authority\n(other than the [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\nAuthority) shall have and maintain its own fund to which\nshall be credited-\n\n(a) all moneys received by the said Authority from the\nState Government by way of grants, loans, advances or\notherwise;\n\n(b) all development charges or other charges or fees\nreceived by the said Authority under this Act or rules or\nregulations made thereunder : and\n\n(c) all moneys received by the said Authority from any\nother source.\n\n(2) Every such Authority may keep in current account in any\nbranch of the State Bank of India or any other Bank\napproved by the State Government in this behalf, such\nportion of its fund as may be prescribed and any money in\nexcess of the said sum shall be invested in such manner as\nmay be approved by the State Government.\n\n108. Fund of the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\nAuthority\n(1) There shall be a fund for the 1[Kolkata]\nMetropolitan Development Authority to which shall be\ncredited--\n\n(a) such moneys as may be paid to it by the State\nGovernment under the Taxes on Entry of Goods into 1\n[Kolkata] Metropolitan Area Act, 1972;\n\n(b) all moneys borrowed by it;\n\n(c) such other moneys as may be received by it from\nthe State Government or from any other authority or source.\n\n(2) The 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development Authority\nshall maintain a sinking fund for the repayment of money\nborrowed by it, and shall every year deposit into the said\nfund such moneys as may be paid to it by the State\nGovernment under the Taxes on Entry of Goods into 1\n[Kolkata] Metropolitan Area Act, 1972.\n\n(3) The money paid into the sinking fund shall be\ninvested in such manner and in such securities as may be\nprescribed.\n\n(4) The sinking fund or any part thereof shall be\napplied in, or towards, the discharge of the loan or part\nthereof for which such fund was created, and until such loan\nor part thereof is wholly discharged, the money standing to\nthe credit of the fund shall be applied for no other purpose.\n\n109 - Grants and advances by State Government\nThe State Government may make such grants, advances and\nloans to any Planning Authority or Development Authority\n(including the 1 [Kolkata] Metropolitan Development\nAuthority) as it may deem necessary for the performance of\nthe functions under this Act and all such grants, loans and\nadvances made shall be on such terms and conditions as the\nState Government may determine.\"\n\nThe sources of fund of KMDA are set out in\nSection 108\n. In addition\n\nthereto,\nSection 109\nof the Act of 1979 stipulates that the State Government\n\nmay make such grants and advances and loans to any planning authority or\n\ndevelopment authority including the KMDA as it may deem necessary for the\n\nperformance of the functions under the Act. It is further stipulated that all such\n\ngrants, loans and advances made, shall be on such terms and conditions as the\n\nState Government may determined.\n\nTo address the first argument raised on behalf of the petitioners that\n\nthere is discrimination between the facilities granted to the direct employees of\n\nthe State Government and those employees of statutory bodies, it is now well\n\nsettled that the same do not stand on the similar footing. Employees of statutory\n\nbodies are governed not only by the act under which they are constituted but\n\nalso have independent bye-laws, Rules and Regulations not only governing their\n\nfunctions but also the terms and conditions of the service of their employees.\n\nThe first argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners, therefore, has\n\nto be answered in negative.\n\nThe second argument raised is that the employees of the some\n\ndevelopment authorities similarly situated like KMDA is also governed under the\n\naforesaid Act of 1979 yet have been granted such benefits and the employees of\n\nKMDA have been denied the benefits of MCAS.\n\nThe impugned order addresses this issue by first contending that such\n\nauthorities and other organizations like Haldia Development Authority, West\n\nBengal Pollution Control Board and Howrah Improvement Trust and West\n\nBengal Housing Board have granted the benefits of MCAS since they have funds\n\nof their own in this regard and the KMDA does not.\n\nArticle 14\npermits reasonable classification but does not permit class\n\nlegislation. The equal protection of laws guaranteed by\nArticle 14\ndoes not mean\n\nthat all laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws\n\nshould apply to all persons. It does not attainment or circumstances in the same\n\nposition. The varying needs of different classes of persons often requires\n\nseparate treatment. From the very nature of society there should be different\n\nlaws in different places and the legitimate controls the policy and enacts laws in\n\nthe best interest of the safety and security of the state. In fact identical\n\ntreatment in unequal circumstances would amount to inequality. So a\n\nreasonable classification is only not permitted but is necessary if society is to\n\nprogress.\n\nThus what\nArticle 14\nforbids is class-legislation but it does not forbid\n\nreasonable classification. The classification however must not be \"arbitrary\n\n,artificial or evasive\" but must be based on some real and substantial bearing a\n\njust and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the\n\nlegislation.\nArticle 14\napplies where equals are treated differently without any\n\nreasonable basis. But where equals and unequals are treated differently,\nArticle\ndoes not apply. Class legislation is that which makes an improper\ndiscrimination by conferring particular privileges upon a class of persons\n\narbitrarily selected from a large number of persons all of whom stand in the\n\nsame relation to the privilege granted that between whom and the persons not so\n\nfavored no reasonable distinction or substantial difference can be found\n\njustifying the inclusion of one and the exclusion of the other from such privilege.\n\nReference may be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the following\n\ncases.\n\nIn the case of\nD.S. Nakara v. Union Of India\nreported in 1983 AIR 130,\n\n1983 SCR (2) 165, the Supreme Court contended as follows:\n\n\"The Government issued an office memorandum announcing a\nliberalized pension scheme for retired government servants but\nmade it applicable to those who had retired after 31 March 1979.\nThe Supreme Court held that the fixing of the cut off date to be\ndiscriminatory as violating\nArticle 14.\nThe division of pensioners\ninto two classes on the basis of the date of retirement was not\nbased on any rational principle because a difference of two days in\nthe matter of retirement could have a traumatic effect on the\npensioner. Such a classification held to be arbitrary and\nunprincipled as there was no acceptable or persuasive reason in its\nfavour. The said classification had no rational nexus with the\nobject sought to achieve.\"\n\nIn the case of\nMadhu Limaye v. Supdt. Tihar Jail Delhi\n, reported in\n\n1975 AIR 1505, 1975 SCR (3) 582, the Supreme Court contended as follows:\n\n\"There were Indian and Europian Prisoners. Both were treated\ndifferently. Europian gets better diet. Court held that difference\nbetween Indian and Europian prisoners in the matter of treatment\nand diet violates right to equality under\nArticle 14\nof Indian\nprisoners. They all are prisoners they must treat equally.\"\n\nIt was also contended that no prior permission of the State Government\n\nwas taken before extending such benefit in view of the denial of MCAS to non\n\nState Government employees under the 4th Pay Commission.\n\nWhile the argument has made in the impugned order by two responsible\n\nPrincipal Secretaries of State Government, who are the Senior IAS Officers,\n\nappears to be ex facie contradictory and self-defeating, Counsel for the State\n\nwould rely upon the fact that merely because an error is committed in the case\n\nof certain bodies, this similar erroneous benefit cannot be derived by the\n\nemployees of the KMDA.\n\nThis Court refers to the doctrine of negative equality evolved in the\n\nfollowing cases.\n\nIn the case of\nUnion of India v. International Trading Co.\n, reported in\n\n(2003) 5 SCC 437 at page 444, Para 13, the Supreme Court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"13. What remains now to be considered, is the effect of\npermission granted to the thirty two vessels. As highlighted by\nlearned counsel for the appellants, even if it is accepted that there\nwas any improper permission, that may render such permissions\nvulnerable so far as the thirty two vessels are concerned, but it\ncannot come to the aid of the respondents. It is not necessary to\ndeal with that aspect because two wrongs do not make one right. A\nparty cannot claim that since something wrong has been done in\nanother case direction should be given for doing another wrong. It\nwould not be setting a wrong right, but would be perpetuating\nanother wrong. In such matters there is no discrimination involved.\nThe concept of equal treatment on the logic of\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India (in short \"the Constitution\") cannot be\npressed into service in such cases. What the concept of equal\ntreatment presupposes is existence of similar legal foothold. It does\nnot countenance repetition of a wrong action to bring both wrongs\non a par. Even if hypothetically it is accepted that a wrong has\nbeen committed in some other cases by introducing a concept of\nnegative equality the respondents cannot strengthen their case.\nThey have to establish strength of their case on some other basis\nand not by claiming negative equality.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nIn the case of M/S Vedanta Aluminium Limited vs Union of India\n\n(RVWPET No.218 of 2011) at Paragraph 17, the Orissa High Court held\n\nas follows:\n\n\"17. Even assuming for the sake of argument that any benefit was\nextended to a similarly situated Company, namely, Jindal Power\nLimited under the Office Memorandum dated 16.11.2010, the\npetitioner has no legal right to claim similar benefit for the reason\nthat there is no concept of negative equality.\n\nA party cannot claim that if something wrong has been done in any\ncase, similar direction should be given for doing the wrong again.\nNo illegality should be allowed to perpetuate under the shelter\nof\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution.\nArticle 14\ndoes not envisage\nfor negative equality, and no one can be permitted to take benefit\nof negative equality.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nIt is now well settled that the negative equality is not permitted under\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. The doctrine of negative equality has\n\nalready explained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the above cited\n\ncases is that no body can claim benefit from a wrongful gain made by similarly\n\nsituated persons.\n\nWhile this Court may have sympathy for the writ petitioners in this\n\nregard, the conduct of the State Government in failing to monitor the activities\n\nand functions of those other statutory bodies cannot be but deprecated. It is\n\nexpected that remedial measures shall be taken by the State in respect of the\nStatutory bodies. This Court is not free from doubt that they are more favorite\n\nstatutory body/employees in the State than the employees of the KMDA\n\nThe only argument advanced on behalf of the State that needs to be dealt\n\nwith by this Court is in terms of\nSection 139\nof the aforesaid 1972 Act.\nSection\nof the aforesaid Act of 1979 stipulates as follows:\n\n\"\nSection 139\n- Power to make regulations\nAny Planning Authority or Development Authority may, with the\nprevious approval of the State Government, make regulations\nconsistent with this Act and the rules made thereunder, to\ncarry out the purposes of this Act and without prejudice to the\ngenerality of this power such regulations may provide for,--\n\n(a) the time and place of holding and procedure to be followed\nin meetings of the Planning Authority, Development Authority\nand Advisory Committee, and the number of members\nnecessary to form a quorum therein;\n\n(b) the powers and duties of the officers and employees of the\nPlanning Authority and Development Authority;\n\n(c) the salaries, allowances and conditions of service of its\nofficers and employees;\n\n(d) the terms and conditions for the continuance of use of any\nland used otherwise than in conformity with a development\nplan; and\n\n(e) any other matter which has to be or may be prescribed by\nrules.\"\n\nSub-Section (C) of\nSection 139\nclearly indicates that the power to frame\n\nregulations for the purpose of governing the salaries, allowances and conditions\n\nof service of its officers and employees is vested in the KMDA but the same has to\n\nbe made in consultation with the State Government.\n\nMr. Ali, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the writ petitioners, relies\n\nupon\nSection 29\nby saying that when the State Government is already in majority\n\nin the governing body of KMDA the consent of the State Government is to an idle\n\nformality and that once the Board of KMDA passes a salary that is empowered to\nframe regulation governing the salaries and emoluments to its employee, and if\n\nthe same including the MCAS such regulations and/or rules must have deemed\n\napproval of the State Government.\n\nThis Court seizes some force in such argument but is reminded of the\n\nwell settled principle that there is no estoppel against the law. The aforesaid\n\nprinciple applies not only in the context of\nSection 139(6)\nread with\nSection 29\nof\n\nthe aforesaid 1972 Act but also in the context of the denial by the 4th Pay\n\nCommission Authorities of MCAS to the persons similarly placed like the\n\npetitioner, i.e., employees of the statutory bodies albeit under the control of the\n\nState Government.\n\nThe following Supreme Court ruling resonate the principle of \"no estoppel\n\nagainst the law\":\n\nIn the case of\nDunlop India Ltd vs Union Of India And Ors\n, reported in\n\n1977 AIR 597, 1976 SCR (2) 98, the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n\"At one stage Mr. Sanghi pointed out that in certain Bills of Entry\nof Dunlop India Limited, their Agents, Messrs Mackinnon.\nMackenzie & Co., Private Ltd., gave the I.T.C. item No. 87 with\nregard to the imported V.P. Latex. This according to Mr. Sanghi\nclearly shows how the appellants themselves have understood the\nmatter. There is, however, no estoppel in law against a party in a\ntaxation matter. In order to clear the goods for the customs, the\nappellants' Agents may have given the classification in accordance\nwith the wishes of the authorities or they may even be under some\nmisapprehension. But when law allows them the right to ask for\nrefund on a proper appraisement and which they actually applied\nfor, we do not attach any significance to this aspect of the matter\npointed out by counsel. The question is of General importance and\nmust be decided on its merits.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\nIn the case of\nJalandhar Improvement Trust vs Sampuran\n\nSingh\n, reported in 1347, JT 1999 (2) SC 598, (1999) 122 PLR 295,\n\n1999 (2) SCALE 415, (1999) 3 SCC 494, the Supreme Court held as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"13. The High Court as well as the lower appellate court also relied\nupon the fact that the Trust had made similar preferential\nallotments as local displaced person in favour of other persons.\nTherefore, the courts below came to the conclusion that even the\nplaintiffs-respondents were entitled to such allotment. In our\nopinion, before coming to this conclusion the courts below should\nhave first decided the question whether the allotment in favour of\nthose persons was within the scope of the Rules applicable. If it\nwas not within the scope of the Rules then even those allotments in\nfavour of other persons will not create a right in the respondents to\nclaim equality with them; may be, if the allotments were made\nwrongly in favour of those persons, the same may become liable for\ncancellation, if permissible in law, but that will not create an\nenforceable right on the respondents to claim similar wrongful\nallotments in their favour. In our opinion, even this ground relied\nupon by the High Court as well as the lower appellate court is\nunsustainable. The courts below next relied upon the fact that in\nregard to some of the respondents, the Trust itself at a point of\ntime made allotments and accepted initial deposits towards the\nconsideration of the plot which was subsequently cancelled. Based\non those facts, the courts below held that the Trust having once\nallotted the plots and having collected part of the consideration, it\ncould not have cancelled the allotments, probably basing the\nrespondents' case on the principle of promissory estoppel. Here the\ncourts below have failed to notice the legal principle that there is\nno estoppel against law. The allotment of plots by the Trust is\ncontrolled by the statutory Rules. Any allotment contrary to those\nRules will be against the law. Since the allotments made in favour\nof some of the respondents was based on wrong application of the\nreservation made for \"local displaced person\" those allotments were\ncontrary to law. Hence, the principle of\npromissory/equitable estoppel cannot be invoked to protect such\nillegal allotments. In the said view of the matter, we are unable to\nsustain the judgments and decrees impugned in these appeals.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\nIn the case of\nBennett Coleman & Co. (P) Ltd vs Punya Priya Das\n\nGupta\n, reported in 1970 AIR 426, 1970 SCR (1) 181, the Supreme\n\nCourt held as follows:\n\n\"The respondent thereafter applied to the Delhi Administration and\nthe latter, as aforesaid, referred his claim to the Labour Court for\nadjudication. In his statement of claim before the Labour Court, the\nrespondent claimed that the monthly wages payable to him were Rs.\n700 basic, Rs. 497 as dearness allowance, Rs. 200 conveyance\nallowance and Rs. 50 being the estimated value of the benefit of a\nfree telephone and newspapers, aggregating Rs. 1,447 per month.\nHe claimed gratuity computable on the basis of Rs. 1,447 as being\nhis monthly wages, Rs. 1,447 as compensation for the month's\nleave, in all, Rs. 6,000.34 P. He did not deduct from the said claim\nthe said amount of Rs. 2,810.47 P. as he had not encashed the\ncheque given to him against the receipt dated November 21, 1963.\nThe company in its written statement denied the claim relying on the\nsaid receipt and further denied that the car allowance and the\nmonetary value for the free telephone and newspapers could be\nincluded in the wages payable to the respondent either as due to\nhim or for calculating gratuity. Before the Labour Court the\ncompany did not dispute the value of the benefit of the free\ntelephone and newspapers estimated by the respondent, but it\nraised the question whether the said value and the car allowance\nformed part of the respondent's wages and whether the amount of\ngratuity payable to him could be ascertained on the footing of their\nbeing part of his wages. The Labour Court held that there was no\nevidence that the car allowance was not payable to the respondent\nwhile he was on leave as was the case in respect of another working\njournalist, C. V. Vishwanath, whose claim also the Labour Court\nwas trying along with that of the respondent. The Labour Court\nfound this difference a significant one and held that the car\nallowance had to be taken as part of the wages. The Labour Court\nalso held that the car allowance and the free telephone and\nnewspapers were an allowance and an amenity respectively falling\nunder the definition L 12 Sup CI/69-13 of\ns. 2 (rr)\nof the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947, both forming the component parts of monthly\nwages payable to the respondent,. As regards the leave, the\nrespondent was undoubtedly entitled to 30 days leave. But the\ncompany's plea was, firstly, that its rules did not permit\ncompensation for such leave and secondly, that it was set off against\nthe period of notice which the respondent was required to give. No\nrules, however, were produced to show that they contained any\nprovision disallowing such compensation. As regards the notice\nperiod of one month, the Labour Court held that as the resignation\ndated October 8, 1963 was accepted with effect from October 21,\n1963 there was compliance of 13 days only and therefore the\nmanagement was not liable to pay for the balance of 17 days leave.\nThe Labour Court rejected the company's plea that the receipt given\nby the respondent in full settlement of all his claims estopped him\nfrom making these claims on the ground that as these items were\nclaimable under the Act there could be no estoppel against law. In\nthe result, the Labour Court held that the respondent was entitled to\nclaim car allowance at Rs. 200 per month, Rs. 50 per month for\ntelephone and news- papers and compensation for 13 days leave,\nthat the first two were parts of his wages, that his monthly\nremuneration was, therefore, Rs. 1,447 and gratuity equivalent to 51\nmonths wages would have to be calculated on the basis of Rs. 1,447\nbeing his wages per month and directed the company to pay on the\naforesaid calculations Rs. 2,002 over and above Rs. 2,810.47 P. for\nwhich the company had issued the said cheque.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nIn the case of\nC. Beepathumma And Ors. vs V.S.\n\nKadambolithaya And Ors.\n, reported in AIR 1965 SC 241, 1964 5 SCR\n\n836, the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n\"18. Mr. S. T. Desai learned counsel for the appellants admits that\nthe mortgagors had not lost their right to the properties comprised\nin Ex. P-2 and that Ex. P-2 incorporated Ex. P-1. Exs. P-63 and P-\n63(a) were filed to establish the connection which, in view of the\nadmission, it is not necessary to set forth here. He also admits that\nhe cannot make out case under\nArt. 134\nof the\nIndian Limitation\nAct\n. He contends that the doctrine of election is but a species of\nestoppel and there can be no estoppel against law especially\nagainst the\nLimitation Act\n, because of\ns. 3\nof that Act. He relies\nupon a decision of the Madras High Court reported in\nSitarama\nChetty and Anr. v. Krishnaswami Chetty\n[(1915) I.L.R. Mad., 38,\n\n374.] where White C.J. quoting a passage from Mr. Mitra's book on\nthe Law of Limitation, observes that an agreement by a person\nagainst whom a cause of action has arisen, that he would not take\nadvantage of the statute, cannot affect its operation on the original\ncause of action, unless such agreement amounts to an\nacknowledgment of liability which the statute recognises as an\nexception to the rule. Mr. Desai also relies upon\nGovardhan Das v.\nDau Dayal\n[(1932) I.L.R. 54 All. 573.] for the proposition that no\none can contract himself out of the statute of limitation, nor can\nestoppel be pleaded against a statutory bar of limitation. Some\nother cases cited by him are not in point and need not be\nmentioned. On the basis of these cases, Mr. Desai contends that\nunless Exs. P-2 and P-2(a) can be pleaded as an acknowledgment\nlimitation cannot be saved in respect of Kunhi Pakki's share and\nthe suit itself must be dismissed under\ns. 3\nof the Limitation Act.\nHe contends that the equitable doctrine of election does not apply\nto the present case, because the documents on which reliance is\nplaced refer not to the 1/4th share of Kunhi Pakki but to the\n3/16th share of Cheriamma which Kunhi Pakki subsequently\nobtained. He states that the latter conclusion is inescapable if Exs.\nP-59, P-60 and P-61 are read together. He submits that in these\ndocuments Kunhi Pakki no doubt connected the 3/16th share with\nExs. P-2 and P-2(a) but treated his own 1/4th share separately.\"\n\nIn the case of\nState Of Rajasthan And Anr vs Surendra Mohnot\n\nAnd Ors\n(Civil Appeal Nos. 5860-5861 of 2014) reported in (2014) 14\n\nSCC 77 at Paragraph 17 the Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n\"17. It is well settled in law that there can be\nno estoppel against law. Consent given in a court that a\ncontroversy is covered by a judgment which has no applicability\nwhatsoever and pertains to a different field, cannot estopp the\nparty from raising the point that the same was erroneously\ncited.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nIn the case of\nRajendra Jha vs Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt,\n\nreported in 1984 AIR 1696, 1985 SCR (1) 544, the Supreme Court held\n\nas follows:\n\n\"In order to get over these difficulties, it is urged by the appellant\nthat there can be no estoppel against law and therefore, it is open\nto him to argue even at this stage that the Labour Court ought not\nto have passed the particular order. In support of this contention\nreliance is placed by the appellant on two judgments of this Court.\n\nIn\nChitturi Subbanna v. Kudapapa Subbanna\n, it was held by the\nmajority that pure questions of law, not dependent on the\ndetermination of any questions of fact, should be allowed to be\nraised for the first time even at later stages of a litigation.\"\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nIt is, however, made clear that in the event the petitioners or the KMDA\n\nAuthorities duly represented by the State Government, approach the next\n\navailable Pay Commission for granting of MCAS benefits to employees of\n\nstatutory corporation and other authorities similarly situated like the petitioners,\n\nthe MCAS Authorities will do so in accordance with law and bearing in mind the\n\nprinciples enshrined in\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid, this Court is unable to grant any benefit to the\n\npetitioners and hence the writ petition does not succeed and is disposed of\n\nwithout any order.\n\nThere will be, however, no order as to costs.\n\nUrgent photostat certified copy of this order, if applied for, be given to the\n\nparties upon compliance of all formalities.\n\n(Rajasekhar Mantha, J.)",

NO. 20936 (W) OF 2014  SWAPAN KUMAR SARDAR & ORS. -VERSUS- THE STATE OF WEST BENGAL & ORS.  FOR THE PETITIONERS: MR. SARDAR AMJAD ALI, SR. ADVOCATE, MS. SUCHARITA ROY.  FOR THE KMDA: MR.

RAJASEKHAR MANTHA, J.:  THE PRINCIPAL CHALLENGE IN THE INSTANT WRIT PETITION BY THE EMPLOYEES OF  THE KOLKATA METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (IN SHORT KMDA) IS TO AN ORDER  DATED 22ND JANUARY, 2014 PASSED BY THE KMDA PURSUANT TO A DIRECTION OF THIS  COURT IN W.P. NO. 842 OF 2011 ( SWAPAN KUMAR SARDAR & ORS. - VS. - THE STATE OF  WEST BENGAL & ORS. ).  THE FACT LEADING TO THE CLAIMS OF THE WRIT PETITIONERS IS THAT THEY WERE  ORIGINALLY GRANTED A CAREER ADVANCEMENT SCHEME (CAS), FOR THE PURPOSE OF  IMPROVING THE ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICE BENEFITS TO THE DIRECT EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND STATE CONTROLLED BODIES. THE SAID CAREER ADVANCEMENT  SCHEME WAS ALLOWED IN OR ABOUT THE YEAR 1995 ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE  CONCERNED PAY COMMISSION NOT ONLY TO THE EMPLOYEES OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT  BUT ALSO TO EMPLOYEES OF THE STATUTORY BODIES UNDER IT.  SUBSEQUENTLY, WHEN THE 4TH PAY COMMISSION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN OR  ABOUT THE YEAR 2002 AN IMPROVED BENEFIT OF A MODIFIED CAREER ADVANCEMENT  SCHEME (MCAS) WAS ALLOWED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.  IT IS SUBMITTED BY THE COUNSEL FOR THE STATE THAT ALTHOUGH THE PAY  COMMISSION WAS REQUESTED TO CONSIDER THE CASE OF EMPLOYEES OF STATUTORY BODIES  UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT, THE SAME WAS DECLINED.  BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER WITH THIS ORDER, IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THE  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CAS AND SUBSEQUENTLY INTRODUCED MCAS. THE  BENEFIT UNDER THE ORIGINAL CAS WAS IN THE FORM OF AN AUTOMATIC INCREMENT AND/OR  CLIMBING ON TO THE NEXT PAY SCALE AVAILABLE TO THOSE EMPLOYEES, WHO WERE  STAGNATING IN THEIR EXISTING PAY SCALE COULD NOT OTHERWISE PROGRESS IN THEIR CAREERS  IN TWO INTERVALS I.E. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF TEN YEARS OF SERVICE (FIRST  ADVANCEMENT/JUMP TO THE NEXT HIGHER PAY SCALE) AND AFTER COMPLETION OF 20 YEARS  (SECOND ADVANCEMENT).  PURSUANT TO THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE 4TH PAY COMMISSION, THE SAME  BENEFIT OF CAREER ADVANCEMENT (HEREINAFTER CALLED THE MODIFIED CAREER  ADVANCEMENT SCHEME) WAS GIVEN TO THE EMPLOYEES AT THREE STAGES, I.E., AFTER EIGHT  YEARS (FIRST MOVEMENT), AFTER SIXTEEN YEARS (SECOND ADVANCEMENT) AND AFTER TWENTY ONE YEARS (THIRD ADVANCEMENT) OF COMPLETION OF THEIR SERVICES.
