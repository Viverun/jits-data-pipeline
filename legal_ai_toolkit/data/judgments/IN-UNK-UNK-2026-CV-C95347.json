This batch of writ\n\npetitions is preferred by the non-government educational\n\ninstitutions to challenge the decision of the State Government\n\nreferred in the communication dated 8.11.2011.\n\n To understand the controversy involved in these petitions,\n\nit shall be appropriate to refer to certain relevant provisions and\n\nother connected facts.\n\n (4)\n\nRajasthan Non-Government Education Institutions Act,\n1989\n :\n\nTo provide for better organization and development of education\n\nin non-government educational institutions in the State of\n\nRajasthan, the Rajasthan State Legislature enacted \"\nRajasthan\n\nNon-Government Education Institutions Act, 1989\n\". \nThe Act\n was\n\nbrought into force on 01.1.1993.\n\n \nChapter-III of the Act\n pertains to aid, accounts and audit\n\nrelating to non-government educational institutions. As per\n\nSection 7\n of the Act, grant of aid by the State Government is\n\navailable to the recognized non-government educational\n\ninstitutions. The may cover such part of the expenditure of the\n\ninstitution as may be prescribed. The aid against salary of the\n\nemployees of an institution cannot be used for any other\n\npurpose.

For ready reference\n\nSections 16\n and \n29\n are quoted :-\n\n 16. Power of the State Government to regulate\n the terms and conditions of employment. - (1)\n The State Government may regulate the recruitment\n and conditions of service, including conditions\n relating to qualifications, pay, gratuity, insurance,\n age of retirement, entitlement of leave, conduct and\n discipline, of persons appointed as employees of\n aided institutions in the State:\n\n Provided that the rights and benefits accruing\n to an employee of an existing institution under the\n grant-in-aid rules in force at the commencement of\n this Act shall not be varied to the disadvantage of\n such employee:\n\n Provided further that every such employee\n shall be entitled to opt for such terms and conditions\n of service as were applicable to him immediately\n before the commencement of this Act:\n\n Provided also that, irrespective of the age of\n retirement prescribed, action may be taken for\n compulsory retirement of such an employee after\n completion of 25 years of service or on attainment of\n the age of 50 years whichever is earlier, in\n accordance with the procedure as may be prescribed.\n\n (2) Every recognized institution shall constitute a\n provident fund for the benefit of its employees in\n\n (6)\n\n such manner and subject to such conditions as may\n be prescribed and contribute to such fund and pay\n interest on the deposited amount at such rate as\n may be prescribed from time to time.\n\n \"29.

Rule 34 of the Rules of 1993\n\nprovides that the scales of pay and allowances of the staff of the\n\naided educational institutions shall not be less than those\n\nprescribed by the Government for the staff of similar category in\n\nthe Government educational institutions. The term \"Allowance\"\n\ninclude Dearness Allowance, House Rent Allowance and City\n\nCompensatory Allowance.\n\n In view of the provisions referred above, parity is required\n\nto be maintained among the employees of government\n\ninstitutions and the non-government educational institutions\n\nrelating to the scale of pay and allowances.\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan notification dtd. 25.1.1992\n\n The Government of Rajathan under a notification dated\n\n25.1.1992 prescribed selection grades for its employees in the\n\ncadre of Class-IV, ministerial and subordinate service. The\n\nselection grades under the notification aforesaid were prescribed\n\nto remove stagnation in service due to less opportunity for\n\npromotion. As per the notification dated 25.1.1992 the\n\n (8)\n\nemployees concerned were required to be awarded selection\n\ngrade on completion of 9, 18 and 27 years of service. Suffice to\n\nmention that on application of the Act of 1989 and the Rules\n\nframed thereunder pay-scales of all the teaching and non-\n\nteaching staff of the non-government educational institutions\n\ncame at par with the similar category of employees working with\n\nGovernment institutions.\n\nJudgment given by Full Bench in S.R. Higher Secondary\nSchool & Others case :\n\nThe decision of the Government of Rajathan notified under the\n\norder dated 25.1.1992 was not applied by the non-government\n\neducational institutions for their employees, hence, several\n\nemployees approached the Non-Government Educational\n\nTribunal to have a direction for the grant of selection grades as\n\nper the notification dated 25.1.1992. The applications so\n\npreferred came to be accepted, thus, the aided institutions\n\npreferred petitions for writ before this Court to challenge the\n\norder passed by the Tribunal.\n\n \nThe issue so agitated came to be resolved by a Full Bench\n\ndecision of this Court in \nS.R. Higher Secondary School & Ors. Vs.\n\nRajasthan Non-Government Educational Institutions Tribunal,\n\nJaipur & Ors.\n, reported in 2002(2) DNJ [Raj.] 613.\n \nThe Hon`ble\n\nFull Bench in the case of \nS.R. Higher Secondary School\n (supra)\n\n (9)\n\ndeclared the employees of non-government educational\n\ninstitutions entitled to selection scales as given to the\n\nemployees/ Teachers serving in Government institutions. While\n\ndeclaring the entitlement of the employees for grant of selection\n\ngrades as per the notification dated 25.1.1992, it was also held\n\nby the Full Bench that the selection scale being salary and once\n\nthe State Government has decided to grant aid to a non-\n\ngovernment educational institution, it will form a part of grant\n\nof aid and, thus, the State Government in the eventuality of\n\nsanctioning grant will pay the same in accordance with the\n\npercentage prescribed to the category in which the non-\n\ngovernment educational institutions is placed.\n\n \nIn light of Full Bench judgment \nreferred above\n, the\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan granted aid to the non-government\n\neducational institutions against the selection grades allowed to\n\ntheir employees.\n\nRajasthan Voluntary Rural Education Service Rules, 2010\n\nThe Governor of Rajasthan while exercising powers conferred by\n\nproviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India framed\n\n\"Rajasthan Voluntary Rural Education Service Rules, 2010\" for\n\nregulating appointment and other service conditions of persons\n\nappointed in the Rajasthan Voluntary Rural Education Service.\n\nRule 4 of the Rules of 2010 provides procedure for appointment\n\n (10)\n\nin government service and Rule 5 prescribes terms and\n\nconditions for appointment of employees in Government service.\n\nThe relevant portion of Rule 4 and Rule 5 \nreferred above\n reads\n\nas follows :\n\n \"4. Procedure of appointment in government\n service.-(1) Such regularly appointed employees in\n the Non-Government Aided Educational Institutions\n who are working against sanctioned and aided post\n on the date of commencement of these rules and\n who desire to be appointed under the Rajasthan\n Voluntary Rural Education Service Rules, 2010, in\n accordance with the terms and conditions mentioned\n in these rules, shall submit within 15 days from the\n date of publication of these rules in the official\n gazette an application in Form-I, to the Secretary of\n the concerned institution mentioning therein his/her\n service particulars with an advance copy of the\n concerned appointing authority.\n\n \"5.

Those who are\ndrawing salary in Rajasthan Civil Service (Revised\nPay Scale) Rules, 1998, Rajasthan Civil Services\n(Revised Pay Scales for Government College\nTeachers including Librarian and PTI rules, 1999 and\nRajasthan Civil Services Revised Pay Scales for\nGovernment Polytechnic College Teachers, Librarians\nand Physical Training Instructors Rules, 2001) shall\nbe allowed benefit of Rajasthan Civil Services\n(Revised Pay Scale for Government College Teachers\nincluding Librarian and PTI Rules, 2009 and\nRajasthan Civil Services Revised Pay Scales for\nGovernment Polytechnic College Teachers, Librarians\nand Physical Training Instructors rules, 2010)\nrespectively with effect from the date they join in the\nGovernment after appointment under these rules.\n\n(vii) No arrears on any account whatsoever,\n(including arrears of salary, selection scale,\nAssured Career Progression or Career\nAdvancement Scheme) shall be paid by the\nState Government for the period prior to the\ndate of their joining in the Government after\nappointment under these rules.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n (13)\n\n(viii) Carry forward of the balance of Privilege Leave\nshall not be allowed.

On application of the\n\nRajasthan Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2008 the pay of\n\nsuch employees was required to be fixed in the revised pay-\n\nscales. The Rules of 2008 were made applicable w.e.f.\n\n01.9.2006, as such, fixation of pay was required to be made\n\nfrom the date aforesaid. The fixation in the revised pay-scales\n\nw.e.f. 01.9.2006 resulted into accrual of arrears of pay for the\n\nemployees who were inducted to Rajathan Voluntary Rural\n\nEducation Service and also to other employees of the non-\n\ngovernment educational institutions. The arrears of pay due to\n\nrevision of pay-scales were required to be paid by the\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan in the form of grant-in-aid to the non-\n\ngovernment educational institutions, but under the impugned\n\ncommunication dated 8.11.2011 such liability was transferred to\n\nthe non-government educational institutions. Such transfer of\n\nliability was made in view of Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules\n\nof 2010, which prescribes that:- \"No arrears on any account\n\nwhatsoever, (including arrears of salary, selection scale, Assured\n\nCareer Progression or Career Advancement Scheme) shall be\n\npaid by the State Government for the period prior to the date of\n\ntheir joining in the Government after appointment under these\n\nRules.\"\n\n (15)\n\n The petitioner Institutions have given challenge to transfer\n\nof such liability on the count that till appointment of employees\n\nof the non-government educational institutions to Rajasthan\n\nVoluntary Rural Education Service, the State was liable to\n\nprovide grant against salary and other allowances including\n\nselection grades, as such, the arrears accruing to the employees\n\nas a consequent to fixation of their pay in the revised pay-scales\n\nshould be borne by the State only.\n\n \nAs per learned counsel for the petitioners in the case of\n\nS.R. Higher Secondary School\n (supra), a Full Bench of this Court\n\nafter examining all relevant provisions held that once the aid is\n\nsanctioned to a non-government educational institution, the\n\nSanctioning Authority is under an obligation to allow\n\nproportionate grant of salary and the salary includes selection\n\ngrade and other allowances. In view of it, the non-disbursal of\n\naid on fixation of pay of the employees in the revised pay-scales\n\nw.e.f. 01.9.2006 shall be in violation of the law \nlaid down by\n Full\n\nBench by taking into consideration all the relevant provisions of\n\nthe Act of 1989 and the Rules framed thereunder.\n\n \nOn the other hand, it is contended by Ms. Minu Purohit,\n\nlearned counsel for the State that the respondents neither\n\nviolated the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in S.R. Higher Secondary\n\n (16)\n\nSchool nor have transferred their liability to the petitioner under\n\nthe communication dated 8.11.2011. As a matter of fact, the\n\ndecision referred in the communication aforesaid is in\n\nconsonance with the provisions of Clause (viii) of Rule 5 of the\n\nRules of 2010 that provides for no payment of arrears on any\n\naccount whatsoever shall be paid to the employees by the State\n\nGovernment for the period prior to the date of their joining the\n\nRajasthan Voluntary Rural Education Service.\n\n In view of the rival contentions, the issue that deserves\n\nadjudication in this petition for writ is :-\n\n \"Whether the State Government was liable to extend aid to\n\n the non-government educational institutions against salary\n\n including selection grades, revision of pay-scales etc.,\n\n relating to the employees of such institutions prior to\n\n coming into effect of the Rules of 2010 ?\n\n If yes, then whether the State Government in light of\n\n Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules of 2010 is right in\n\n absolving itself from its liability to grant aid to the non-\n\n government educational institutions as notified under the\n\n communication dated 8.11.2011, issued by the Principal\n\n Secretary to the Government of Rajathan, Department of\n\n School & Sanskrit Education (Group-5), Jaipur\".\n\n (17)\n\n Heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\nIn \nS.R. Higher Secondary School & Ors. Vs. Rajathan Non-\n\nGovernment Educational Institutions Tribunal & Ors.\n (supra), a\n\nFull Bench of this Court by taking into consideration relevant\n\nprovisions of the Act of 1989 and the Rules framed thereunder\n\nexamined the question that whether grant of selection scale to\n\ngovernment servants as per the circular dated 25.1.1992 is a\n\npromotion to higher post or a higher pay-scale in the same post,\n\nand if it is pay-scale, then whether the Teachers of non-\n\ngovernment educational institutions would also be entitled for\n\nthe same at par with the employees of the Government\n\ninstitutions ? The Full Bench also examined the question that as\n\nto whether the State is oblige to contribute grant-in-aid for the\n\nselection scale provided under the circular dated 25.1.1992.\n\n The Full Bench after taking into consideration the\n\nprovisions of \nSection 29\n of the Act of 1989 and Rule 34 of the\n\nRules of 1993 arrived at a definite conclusion that the employees\n\nof aided educational institutions must be paid the same pay-scale\n\nand allowances as the employees in Government institutions are\n\ngetting. The selection grade provided under the notification\n\ndated 25.1.1992 is not a promotion to higher post but a higher\n\npay-scale on the same post, therefore, it shall also be payable\n\n (18)\n\nto the employees of non-government educational institutions.\n\n The question that is having much significance in the\n\npresent controversy is regarding liability of the State\n\nGovernment to provide aid to the non-government educational\n\ninstitutions against salary. The Full Bench examined this issue\n\nin lucid and held as under :-\n\n \"19. Now, it brings us to the question as to whether\n the State is obliged to contribute grant-in-aid for the\n selection scale provided under the circular dated\n 25.1.1992. \nThe Act\n of 1989 has been enacted to\n provide for better organization and development of\n education in the Non-Government educational\n institution in the State of Rajasthan \nSection 7\n of the\n Act provides for grant of aid. Only a recognized\n institution run by a Society registered under the\n \nSocieties Registration Act\n would be given the grant in\n aid, subject to such terms as may be prescribed. The\n sanctioning authority may sanction and distribute aid\n to a recognized institution from time to time in\n accordance with the procedure as may be\n prescribed. In exercise of the powers conferred by\n Rule 43 of the Rules, the State Government framed\n Rules regulating recognition, grant of aid and service\n conditions etc. of the NGEIs. Rule 10 of the Rules\n provide for general conditions governing grant-in-\n aid. Rule 11 deals with procedure, for grant- in-aid.\n Rule 12 is for finalization of maintenance or recurring\n grant. Rule 13 is in regard to assessment of annual\n recurring grant on the basis of estimated expenditure\n\n (19)\n\nof the current year and will be subject to adjustment\nof grant payable in the next year Rule 14 deals with\napproved expenditures. Rule 15 is for payment of\nrecurring grant. Rule 16 deals with non recurring\ngrant. \nSection 7\n of the Act reads as under :-\n\n \"Grant of aid to recognized institutions.-\n (1) No aid shall be claimed by an institution as\n a matter of right.\n\n (2) Unrecognized institutions shall not be\n eligible to receive any aid.\n\n (3) Subject to such terms and conditions as\n may be prescribed, the sanctioning authority\n may sanction and distribute aid to recognized\n institutions from time to time in accordance\n with the procedure as may be prescribed.\n\n (4) The aid may cover such part of the\n expenditure of the institution as may be\n prescribed.\n\n (5) No amount out of aid given for salary of the\n employees of an institution shall be used for\n any other purpose.\n\n (6) The sanctioning authority may stop, reduce\n or suspend aid on breach of any of the terms\n and conditions prescribed in this behalf.\n (7) The amount of aid may normally be paid to\n the secretary of the managing committee of an\n institution but, in special circumstances and for\n reasons to be recorded in writing, such amount\n may be paid to any person authorized by the\n Director of Education or by any other officer\n empowered by him in this behalf.''\n\n (20)\n\n On the basis of \nSection 7\n it is contended by the\ncounsel for State that no aid can be claimed as a\nmatter of right. It is for the government to decided\nnot only whether the grant-in-aid is to be given to\nrecognized institution but also as to how much and\nunder what heads the grant is to be sanctioned to\nthe NGEIs. \nIn counter it is submitted by the counsel\nfor petitioners that once educational institution is\nregistered, it is entitled to grant- in-aid from\ngovernment as a matter of right and for this\nproposition reliance was placed on the decision of\n\nState of Maharashtra v. Manubhai Pragali Vashi\n (11)\nThis case, in our opinion, does not assist the\npetitioners in contending that they are entitled as a\nmatter of right to get the grant-in-aid from the State.\n\nIt was a case in which the Govt. of Maharashtra\ndenied grant-in-aid to the recognized private law\ncolleges while the same was extended to other\nfaculties of the private colleges. The court\nemphasized upon the necessity of giving legal\neducation and to fulfil the obligation under Article\n390A of the Constitution of providing free legal aid\nand held that the faculty of law in the matter of (sic)\ngrant-in-aid run by private recognized colleges\ncannot be discriminated on the ground of being a\nprofessional course falling upon the economic\nresources. The court emphasizing upon the necessity\nof maintaining status of legal education held that\nthese aspects necessarily flowing from \nArticles 21\n\nand \n39-A\n of the Constitution were totally lost sight of\nby the Government when it denied the grant-in-aid\nto the recognized private law colleges as was\nafforded to other faculties. The State has abdicated\n\n (21)\n\nthe duty enjoined on it by the relevant provisions of\nthe Constitution as aforesaid. Accordingly, the Court\ndirected the Government to extend grant- in-aid\nscheme to Govt. recognized private law colleges on\nthe same criteria on which such grants were given to\nother faculties viz. Arts, Science, Commerce,\nEngineering and Medicine from the Academic Year\n1995.\n\nUnder Sub-section (1) of \nSection 7\n, educational\ninstitutions cannot claim grant-in-aid from the\ngovernment as a matter of right i.e. to say on an\napplication moved by an NGEI for grant of aid, it is\nnot incumbent on the government to grant aid to\nsuch an institution if reasonable ground exists for not\ngranting aid to such an institution. However, the\ngovernment cannot refuse grant arbitrarily or\nwithout there being any justiciable reason. In the\npresent case all the petitioners have been allocated\ngrant-in-aid. The question really is whether once the\naid is sanctioned, the sanctioning authority has a\npower to fix it exercising its own discretion or the\ngrant has to be made as provided under Sub-sees.\n(3) and (4) of \nSection 7\n of the Act read with the\nRules and in the matter of quantum of grant in aid\nno discretion is left with the sanctioning authority.\n\nIt is an admitted fact that the petitioners are\nenjoying grant- in-aid from the government. From\nthe scheme of the Rules, it appear that the\nassessment of annual recurring grant would be\nsanctioned on the basis of estimated expenditure of\nthe current year, and the institutions shall be\n\n (22)\n\ncategorized under advice of the grant-in-aid\nCommittee and would be allowed grant-in-aid.\n\n20. Rule 13(2) speaks of Approved expenditure to be\narrived at according to these Rules and such other\ninstructions that may be issued from time to time.\nRule 13(3) speaks of categorizations of the\ninstitutions under advise of the grant-in-aid\nCommittee and to be allowed grant-in-aid as :-\n\nCategory A 80% of the approved expenditure of\n\nB 70% the previous year plus likely\nC 60% annual increment of staff.\n\nD 50%\nSpecial Category - 90%\n\nRule 14(a) includes actual salary, and provident fund\ncontribution not exceeding 8.33% in respect of\nteaching and non- teaching staff, apart from the\nother approved expenditures as \nlaid down in\n Rule 14.\n\n\"Salary\" is defined in \nSection 2(r)\n of the Act which\nmeans the aggregate of the emoluments of an\nemployee including dearness allowance or any other\nallowance or relief for the time being payable to him,\nbut does not include compensatory allowance. The\nextended definition of salary provides for aggregate\nof emoluments received by the teacher which also\nincludes all allowances excluding the compensatory\nallowance and also extended to the relief for the time\nbeing payable to the teacher. The selection scale\ngiven to the teacher shall certainly fall within the four\ncorners of the definition of \"Salary\". Although \nSection\n7\n of the Act provides that no aid shall be claimed by\nan institution as a matter of right, once it is decided\n\n (23)\n\n to grant aid under \nSection 7(3)\n of the Act, the\n sanctioning authority is to sanction and distribute to\n a recognized institution aid from time to time in\n accordance with the procedure as may be prescribed.\n \nSection 7(4)\n of the Act provides that the aid may\n cover such part of the expenditure of the institution\n as may be prescribed. \nSection 7(3)\n read with \nSection\n 7(4)\n makes it clear that the aid which has to be\n granted to a recognized institution shall cover the\n estimated expenditure of the current year and the\n approved expenditure as provided under Rule 14 of\n the Rules. Once it is decided by the Government to\n provide grant-in-aid in accordance with \nSections 7(3)\n\n and \n7(4)\n of the Act, it leaves no room for the\n sanctioning authority to exercise its discretion to\n grant or not to grant the aid in regard to the items\n covered under \nSection 7(3)\n and \n7(4)\n of the Act.\n Selection scale being salary, once the State\n Government had decided to grant aid to an NGEI, it\n will form the part of the grant-in-aid and thus the\n State Government in the eventuality of sanctioning\n the grant will pay for the same in accordance with\n the percentage prescribed to the category in which\n the NGEIs is placed.\"\n\n \nAs per law \nlaid down by\n Full Bench in the case aforesaid,\n\nthe selection grade being salary, shall form part of grant-in-aid\n\nand the State Government in the eventuality of awarding grant is\n\nrequired to pay the same in accordance with the percentage\n\nprescribed. The State Government, thus, was settled with a\n\nliability to sanction and award proportionate aid for grant of\n\n (24)\n\nsalary to the non-government educational institutions receiving\n\naid.\n\n A deviation from the obligation to provide aid to the non-\n\ngovernment educational institutions against salary of the\n\nemployees is sought to be made under the impugned\n\ncommunication dated 8.11.2011. Suffice to mention that the\n\ndeviation sought to be made refers for payment of arrears from\n\n01.9.2006 onwards. The deviation is founded on Clause (vii) of\n\nRule 5 of the Rules of 2010. If the Rules of 2010 would have not\n\nbeen introduced, the State Government would have released the\n\ngrant including arrears of salary for the period commencing from\n\n01.9.2006 onwards. Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules of 2010\n\nas already stated mentions that no arrears on any account\n\nwhatsoever (including arrears of salary, selection scale, Assured\n\nCareer Progression or Career Advancement Scheme) shall be\n\npaid by the State Government for the period prior to the date of\n\njoining by the employee concern to the State Government\n\nVoluntary Education Service. The provision as a matter of fact is\n\na condition for appointment of employees to the service created\n\nunder the Rules of 2010. The Rules clearly indicates the purpose\n\nand object i.e. to absorb employees of non-government\n\neducational institutions working against aided and sanctioned\n\nposts in Government employment. The service so created is\n\nhaving only one mode of appointment, that is taking over of\n\n (25)\n\nemployees from non-government educational institutions\n\nworking against the sanctioned and aided posts and further the\n\nentire cadre created is a dying one. While giving appointment to\n\nthe service, an undertaking was also sought from teach of the\n\nemployees in consonance to Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules of\n\n2010. \nClause (vii) that restricts him to claim arrears from\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan. It, however, does not bar the\n\nemployees to claim the same from the educational institutions\n\nwhere they were working prior to appointment under the Rules\n\nof 2010. The resultant is that Clause (vii) transfers liability of the\n\nState Government to the institution concern to pay complete\n\nsalary to such employees from 01.9.2006 onwards. This liability\n\notherwise was of the State Government by force of the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 1989 as discussed and interpreted by Full\n\nCourt in \nS.R. Higher Secondary School\n (supra). As a matter of\n\nfact, by Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules of 2010 a mode is\n\nadopted by the State Government to escape itself from its\n\nstatutory liability to award grant to the non-government\n\neducational institutions while making payment of arrears of\n\nsalary to the employees.\n\n \nAs already stated, Clause (vii) of Rule 5 is a condition for\n\nemployees for not claiming arrears from the State Government\n\nand that is having no concern with the non-government\n\neducational institutions, where the employees concern were\n\n (26)\n\nearlier working. This condition puts a restriction upon the\n\nemployees for not claiming arrears of pay from the State\n\nGovernment but it in no manner prohibits them to claim the\n\nsame from the non-government educational institutions,\n\nmeaning thereby, the non-government educational institutions\n\nwhere the employees concern were earlier working are required\n\nto pay all arrears to such employees. The non-government\n\neducational institutions, however, as a matter of fact in view of\n\nthe provisions of the Act of 1989 and the Rules framed\n\nthereunder and also in view of the law \nlaid down by\n Full Bench of\n\nthis Court in the case of \nS.R. Higher Secondary School\n (supra)\n\nhad a right to receive aid against salary of the employees\n\nworking against sanctioned and aided posts till absorption/\n\nappointment of such employees to a service created under the\n\nRules of 2010. In the event of claim, such arrears by the\n\nemployees, the non-government educational institutions, thus,\n\ncan certainly claim for grant of aid from the State Government.\n\nPertinent to note that the Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules of\n\n2010 nowhere restricts the non-government educational\n\ninstitutions to have such aid for making payment of salary to its\n\nemployees, who were subsequently taken on State roll under the\n\nRajasthan Voluntary Rural Education Service created under the\n\nRules of 2010. The Government of Rajathan by its decision\n\ncirculated under the impugned communication dated 8.11.2011,\n\nas a matter of fact, has intended to strip non-government\n\n (27)\n\neducational institutions from their valuable right to have grant-\n\nin-aid. No such administrative decision could have been taken to\n\ntake off the rights allready accrued. It is well settled that even\n\nby application of Rule with retrospective effect the rights already\n\nvested/accrued cannot be taken away.\n \nHon`ble the Supreme\n\nCourt in \nState of Gujarat Vs. Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni\n,\n\nreported in 1983 Lab. I.C. 391 while dealing with an eventuality\n\nwhere a vested right was taken away by making amendment in\n\nRules with retrospective effect held as under :-\n\n \"Now in 1978 before the \nAmending Act\n was\n passed thanks to the provisions of the\n principle Act of 1961 the ex-municipal\n employees who had been allocated to the\n panchayat service as Secretaries Officer\n and servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats,\n had achieved the status of government\n servants. Their status as government\n servants could not be extinguished so long\n as the posts were not abolished and their\n services were not terminated in accordance\n with the provisions of \nArticle 311\n of the\n Constitution. Nor was it permissible to single\n them out for differential treatment. That\n would offend \nArticle 14\n of the Constitution. An\n attempt was made to justify the purported\n differentiation on the basis of history and\n ancestry as it were. It was said that Talatis\n and Kotwals who became secretaries, officers\n and servants of Gram and Nagar Panchayats\n\n (28)\n\nwere government servants, even to start with,\nwhile municipal employees who became\nsuch secretaries, officers and servants of\nGram and Nagar Panchayats were not. Each\ncarried the mark or the 'brand' of his origin\nand a classification on the basis of the source\nfrom which they came into the service, it was\nclaimed, was permissible. We are clear that\nit is not. Once they had joined the common\nstream of service to perform the same\nduties, it is clearly not permissible to\nmake any classification on the basis of their\norigin. Such a classification would be\nunreasonable and entirely irrelevant to the\nobject sought to be achieved. It is to\nnavigate around these two obstacles of\n\nArticle 311\n and \nArticle 14\n that the\n\nAmending Act\n is sought to be made\nretrospective, to bring about an artificial\nsituation as if the erstwhile municipal\nemployees never became members of a\nservice under the State. Can a law be made\nto destroy today's accrued constitutional\nrights by artificially reverting to a situation\nwhich existed 17 years ago ? No.\n\nThe legislation is pure and simple self-\ndeceptive if we may use such an expression\nwith reference to a legislature made law. The\nlegislature is undoubtedly competent to\nlegislate with retrospective effect to take\naway or impair any vested right acquired\nunder existing laws but since the laws are\n\n (29)\n\nmade under a written Constitution and have\nto conform to the dos and don'ts of the\nConstitution, neither prospective nor\nretrospective laws can be made so to\ncontravene fundamental rights. The law\nmust satisfy the requirements of the\nConstitution today taking into account the\naccrued or acquired rights of the parties\ntoday. The law cannot say 20 years ago the\nparties had no rights, therefore, the\nrequirements of the Constitution will be\nsatisfied if the law is dated back by 20 years.\n\nWe are concerned with today's rights and\nnot yesterday's. A legislature cannot\n\nlegislate today with reference to a situation\nthat obtained 20 years ago and ignore the\nmarch of events and the constitutional\nrights accrued in the course of the 20\nyears. That would be most arbitrary,\nunreasonable and a negation of\nhistory.......Today's equals cannot be made\nunequal by saying that they were unequal\n20 years ago and we will restore that position\nby making a law today and making it\nretrospective. Constitutional rights,\nconstitutional obligations and constitutional\nconsequences cannot be tampered with that\nway. A law which if made today would be\nplainly invalid as offending constitutional\nprovisions in the context of the existing\nsituation cannot become valid by being\nmade retrospective. Past virtue\n(constitutional) cannot be made to wipe\n\n (30)\n\n out present vice (constitutional) by making\n retrospective laws. We are, therefore, firmly\n of the view that the \nGujarat Panchayats\n (Third Amendment) Act\n 1978 is\n unconstitutional as it offends \nArticles 311\n and\n \n14\n and is arbitrary and unreasonable.\"\n\n In the case of R.S. Ajara and Ors. Vs. State of Rajathan\n\nand Ors. (1997(3) SCC 641) and in Ex.Capt. \nK.C. Arora and Anr.\n\nVs. State of Haryana and Ors. (AIR 1987 SC 1858), the Hon`ble\n\nApex Court reiterated the law laid down in the case of \nState of\n\nGujarat Vs. Raman Lal Keshav Lal Soni\n (supra) by holding that a\n\nbenefit that has accrued could not have been taken away by\n\nintroducing amendment in the Rules retrospectively. The\n\nmandate of the judgments referred is that no statutory rule or\n\nadministrative order can whittle down or destroy any right which\n\nhas become crystallized and that effects or impairs vested rights.\n\n \nIn the case in hand, as already stated earlier Clause (vii) of\n\nRule 5 of the Rules of 2010 is not having application upon the\n\nnon-government educational institutions like the petitioners and\n\nonly by an administrative decision, circulated under the\n\ncommunication dated 8.11.2011 a valuable right of receiving\n\nproportionate aid under the Act of 1989, the Rules framed\n\nthereunder and as per the law \nlaid down in\n the case of \nS.R.\n\nHigher Secondary School\n (supra) has been taken away. Such\n\n (31)\n\nwithdrawal of accrued right is apparently bad in view of the\n\ndiscussion made above.\n\n For the sake of arguments even it is assumed that by\n\nnecessary implication the Clause (vii) of Rule 5 of the Rules of\n\n2010 restricts the non-government educational institutions like\n\nthe petitioners to have aid against salary, then such restriction\n\ntoo is not valid in view of the authoritative pronouncement of the\n\nHon`ble Supreme Court in the cases \nreferred above\n. The Rule\n\nconcerned, therefore, is required to be read in consonance with\n\nthe settled proposition of law, as such, irrespective of Clause (vii)\n\nof Rule 5 of the Rules of 2010 the Government of Rajathan is\n\nstatutorily abide to sanction and award aid to the petitioner\n\ninstitutions against the salary including revision of pay-scale,\n\ngrant of selection grades etc., w.e.f. 01.9.2006 onwards till the\n\ndate of appointment of the employee concern to Rajathan\n\nVoluntary Rural Education Service crated under the Rules of\n\n2010.\n\n The petitions for writ, therefore, deserves acceptance.\n\nAccordingly, the same are allowed. The decision of the\n\nGovernment of Rajasthan under the communication dated\n\n8.11.2011 for transferring liability to make payment of arrears\n\nrelating to payment of pay, revision of pay, grant of selection\n\ngrade, career progression or career advancement scheme solely\n\n (32)\n\n upon the non-government educational institutions is declared\n\n illegal. The Government of Rajathan is directed to sanction and\n\n award aid to the petitioners non-government educational\n\n institutions to make payment of arrears to their employees\n\n accruing as a consequent to fixation of their pay in the revised\n\n pay-scales under the Pay-Scale Rules, 2008 w.e.f. 01.9.2006\n\n onwards till the date of their appointment to Rajathan Voluntary\n\n Rural Education Service created under the Rules of 2010.\n\n No order to cost.\n\n [GOVIND MATHUR], J.\n\nSanjay",
