Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat the deceased was aged less than 18 years at the time of her marriage\nwith accused Sandeep. The said fact has been duly proved by the defense\nthrough the evidence of DW2 Kanwar Pal Singh.

The said entry Ex. DW-2/A was\nregistered on the basis of school admission application Ex. DW-2/B and\nthe passing certificate issued from her previous school dated 10.07.2007\nEx. DW-2/C. Therefore, on 19.04.2012, the deceased was less than 16\nyears of age. Furthermore, it was argued by the Ld. Defense counsel that\nthe marriage of the deceased Nisha was solemnized by her family\nmembers against her wish and consent. Deceased Nisha was not happy\nwith the said marriage with accused Sandeep and therefore, she\ncommitted suicide by hanging herself. It was only after her death by\nsuicide, her family members have leveled false allegations against the\naccused persons and no dowry was ever demanded by the accused\npersons and no cruelty was committed by them upon the deceased.\n\n26.

The testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar\nwas recorded only on 23.01.2017, after he had filed a false and frivolous\ncomplaint against accused Sandeep and his brother-in-law Chawan. The\nsaid motivated complaint ended up in registration of FIR no. 865/16\n u/s\n307\n/\n34\n IPC, 1860 at PS Loni, Ghaziabad, UP. The falsity of the\nallegations in the said FIR came to light during the investigation and\nultimately the police proceeded ahead to file the cancellation report in\nthe said case FIR. The cancellation report was accepted by the concerned\ncourt. The sole purpose of the complainant Pramod Kumar in getting the\nsaid false FIR registered against accused Sandeep and Chawan (mediator\nof the marriage) was to pressurize and extort money from the accused\npersons.\n\n27. It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat in the present case the prosecution has failed miserably to satisfy the\nmost essential ingredient of the offence punishable\n u/s 304-B\n IPC, 1860,\ni.e. \" soon before the death\" the deceased was subjected to cruelty on\nthe demands of dowry. The prosecution through the testimonies of PW2\nPramod Kumar and PW6 Satender Kumar tried to prove that accused\nSandeep had telephonically contacted them on 28.11.2014. Furthermore,\nas per the case of the prosecution, accused Sandeep made them talk to\nthe deceased and at that time the deceased had disclosed about the\nharassment and torture meted out to her on that day by the accused\npersons. However, from the testimony of PW28 Ajeet Singh, CDR of the\nmobile phone of the accused Sandeep was brought on record and no such\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:16:51\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat the prosecution could not prove the subsequent opinion about the\nhanging, since the concerned doctor who had given the second opinion\nwas never cited as one of the prosecution witnesses. The reason behind\nthe same was that the said second opinion was not supporting the case of\nthe prosecution.\n\n29. It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat from the testimonies of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender\nKumar only general and cryptic allegations have been leveled against the\naccused persons. There are no specific incidents that have come to light\nthrough their testimonies and from the deposition of prosecution\nwitnesses, it has not come on record, the manner in which the alleged\ncruelty was committed upon the deceased, so as to drive her to commit\nthe suicide.\n\n30. It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat there are number of material improvements and contradictions in the\ntestimony of two star prosecution witnesses PW2 Pramod Kumar and\nPW6 Satender and they cannot be considered as sterling witnesses. Both\nthe said witnesses could not withstand the rigors of the cross\nexamination conducted by Ld. Defense counsel.\n\n31. It is submitted by the Ld.

Furthermore, there\nis no ocular witness of the cruelty meted out to the deceased at the hands\nof the accused persons. PW12 Sonu Kumar is a planted witness, and he\nwas made part of the prosecution list of witnesses by the IO, in order to\nfalsely create the evidence qua the most essential ingredients of \nsection\n304-B\n IPC, 1860 i.e. \"soon before the death\", he allegedly went to\nhandover the invitation card of the marriage of his brother at the house of\nthe accused persons and that he met the deceased there and he was being\ntold about the said torture by the deceased herself. However, the said\nwitness could not withstand the test of cross examination and his\ntestimony is also not of sterling character. He could not bring on record\nthe said invitation card, thereby, making his entire testimony\nunbelievable.\n\n32. It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat the prosecution could not prove that the alleged demand of Rs. 2\nlacs constituted as a dowry demand, since it is the case of the\nprosecution itself that the said demand was allegedly raised by the\naccused persons to enable accused Sandeep to start a new business.\nFurthermore, there are material improvements and contradictions in the\ntestimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender in this regard.\n\n33.

It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat as per the prosecution version, deceased Nisha was adopted by her\nchacha PW2 Pramod Kumar. However, during his cross examination,\nPW2 Pramod Kumar could neither tell about the date of birth of the\ndecease nor could he depose about the date the alleged adoption.\nSimilarly, the other chacha of the deceased PW6 Satender had also\ndeposed that he was not aware of the date of birth of the deceased, in\nspite of deposing before the court that the deceased was living in their\nhouse with them. Furthermore, all the prosecution witnesses PW2\nPramod Kumar, PW6 Satender and PW9 Devendra have categorically\ndeposed that the deceased was around 18-19 years at the time of her\nmarriage. However, it was categorically brought on record through the\ntestimony of DW2 Kanwar Pal Singh that the date of birth of the\ndeceased was 01.07.1996, thereby, making her less than 16 years at the\ntime of her marriage.\n\n35.

However, the father of the deceased PW9 Devendra had\ndeposed that his daughter remained with his brother PW2 Pramod\nKumar at village Budheda, till she was about 12 years old.\n\n36. It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat there are material improvements and contradictions in the testimony\nof PW2 Pramod Kumar qua the dowry demand of Rs. 2 lacs raised by\nthe accused persons and when the said demand was satisfied by him. He\ncould not prove the source from which he had arranged the said amount\nand also could not depose the mixture of currency denomination. As per\nthe prosecution story, it was the cousin brother of PW2, namely PW10\nRajesh Kumar who had allegedly given a loan of Rs. 2 lacs to PW2,\nhowever, in his cross examination PW10 had admitted that he could\nmanage to save only Rs. 4,000/- per month from his salary at that time.\n\n37.

As per the father of the deceased PW9 Devendra, he\nmet accused Mahesh at the hospital and no other family member of the\naccused Sandeep was present there besides accused Mahesh. However,\nPW2 Pramod Kumar had deposed that no one from the family of the\naccused persons was present in the hospital. However, the IO PW14 SI\nRaj Kumar had deposed that when he reached the hospital for the first\ntime, accused Mahesh and his mother (accused Vikram Devi @\nKrishana) were present.\n\n40. It is submitted by the Ld. Defense counsel for the accused persons\nthat it has come in the testimony of PW10 Rajesh Kumar, who had\nallegedly lent Rs. 2 lacs to PW2 Pramod Kumar, that he was being\ninformed by PW2 Pramod Kumar that the said amount of money was\nrequired by him to be given to accused Sandeep for his\nemployment/business, however, he had not deposed anywhere that PW2\nhad informed him that deceased Nisha was being harassed by accused\nSandeep on the account of dowry demands.\n\n41.

Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 62/110\n Relevant Law & the case laws:\n\n45. Before coming to the discussion of the evidence adduced by the\nprosecution on merits, this court deems it necessary to discuss the law\nand the judgments passed by the superior courts in this regard.\n\n46. In order to succeed in charge under \nSection 498A\n of the Indian\nPenal Code, 1860 the prosecution is required to prove that the accused\nhad subjected the deceased to cruelty, as defined in the explanation to the\nsection. For this purpose, the provision of \nSec. 498A\n IPC, 1860 is\nreproduce as under:-\n\n \"\nSec. 498A\n IPC, 1860. Husband or relative of\n husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty:\n\n Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the\n husband of a woman, subjects such woman to\n cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a\n term which may extend to three years and shall also\n be liable to fine.\n\n Explanation.--For the purposes of this section,\n \"cruelty means\"--\n\n (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is\n likely to drive the woman to commit suicide or to\n cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health\n (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or\n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment\n is with a view to coercing her or any person related Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n\n to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:17:36\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 63/110\n or valuable security or is on account of failure by her\n or any person related to her to meet such demand.\"\n\n47. It is clear from a bare reading of the said provision in conjunction\nwith the 'Explanation' appended to the said section, that it is not every\ncruelty which is punishable under \nSection 498A\n of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860. The cruelty, so as to attract penal provisions, contained in\n\nSection 498A\n of Indian Penal Code, 1860, has necessarily to be a willful\nconduct, which is of such a nature that it is likely to drive a woman to\ncommit suicide or cause grievous injury or danger to her life or health.\nThe use of the expression \"willful\" in the explanation to \nSection 498A\n of\nIndian Penal Code, 1860, indicates that the conduct attributed to the\naccused, in order to be culpable, needs to be deliberate, aimed at causing\ninjury to the health of the woman or bringing misery to her. If the\naccused knows or is reasonably expected to know that his conduct is\nlikely to cause injury to the life, limb or health of the aggrieved woman\nor if his conduct is of such a nature, that causing injury to the life, limb\nor health can be a natural consequence for the woman, who is recipient\nof such a conduct, it will attract criminal liability on the part of the\nhusband or his relative, as the case may be.\n\n48. It is easily believed that everyone is presumed to intend the natural\nconsequences of his act and such a presumption must necessarily be\ndrawn even if there is no intention to cause any injury or harm to the\nwoman. Whether the conduct in question is likely to drive the woman to\ncause injury to her life, limb or health, will depend upon a number of Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:17:43\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 64/110\n factors such as social and economic status of the parties, the level of\nawareness of the aggrieved woman, her temperament, state of her health,\nphysical as well as mental and how she is likely to perceive such a\nbehavior. If a woman is harassed with a view to coerce her or any of her\nrelatives to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable\nsecurity, it will also constitute cruelty, as defined in the explanation to\n\nSection 498A\n of Indian Penal Code.\n\n49. The expression \"Cruelty\" takes in its ambit mental cruelty as well\nas physical torture of the woman. If the conduct of the accused with a\nwoman is likely to cause a reasonable apprehension in her mind that her\nliving with the husband will be harmful and injurious to her life and\nsafety, such a conduct would attract criminal liability, envisaged in\n\nSection 498A\n of IPC, 1860.\n\n50. If the woman has been harassed on account of her failure or the\nfailure of her relatives to meet an unlawful demand for property or\nvaluable security, that also constitutes cruelty, within the meaning of\n\nSection 498A\n of IPC. The expression \"harassment\" has not been defined\nin \nSection 498A\n of IPC, but its dictionary meaning is 'to subject\nsomeone to continuous vexatious attacks, questions, demands or other\nunpleasantness, etc'. However, it is not harassment of every nature\nwhich is punishable under \nSection 498A\n of IPC. In order to attract\ncriminal liability, there should be torture physical or mental, by positive\nacts. Such acts should be aimed at persuading or compelling the woman\nor her relatives to meet an unlawful demand of any property or valuable Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:17:50\n +0530\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 65/110\n security or it should be actuated by the failure of the woman or her\nrelative to meet such a demand\n\n51. It is also pertinent to reproduce the provision\n u/s 304B\n IPC, as\nunder:-\n\n \" Sec. 304B. Dowry Death\n (1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any\n burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under\n normal circumstances within seven years of her\n marriage and it is shown that soon before her death\n she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her\n husband or any relative of her husband for, or in\n connection with, any demand for dowry, such death\n shall be called \"dowry death\", and such husband or\n relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.\n (2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished\n with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less\n than seven years but which may extend to\n imprisonment for life.\"\n\n52. It is clear from the said provision that in order to establish a charge\nunder \nSection 304B\n of Indian Penal Code, which deals with what is\ndescribed as \"dowry death\", the prosecution must necessarily prove the\nfollowing ingredients:\n\n i. The death of a woman must have been caused by burn or Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:17:56\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

Soon before her death, the woman must have been subjected\n to cruelty or harassment by her husband or by relatives of her\n husband;\n\n iv. Such cruelty or harassment must be for or in connection with\n demand for dowry;\n\n v. Such cruelty or harassment should have been meted out to the\n woman soon before her death.\n\n53. The term \"Dowry\" has not been defined in \nSection 304B\n of IPC,\nbut, since this expression has been defined in \nSection 2\n of Dowry\nProhibition Act, 1961 it is required to be given the same meaning for the\npurpose of under \nSection 304B\n IPC as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin \"\nSatvir Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab and Anr.\n\" 2001 (4) Crimes 45\n(SC). \nSection 2\n of Dowry Prohibition Act defines dowry as under:\n\n \"....Definition of 'dowry'. In this Act, \"dowry\"\n\n means any property or valuable security given or\n agreed to be given either directly or indirectly (a) by\n one party to a marriage to the other party to the\n marriage, or (b) by the parent of either party to a\n marriage or by any other person, to either party to\n the marriage or to any other person, at or before 3 or\n any time after the marriage 4in connection with the\n marriage of the said parties, but does not include ATUL\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:18:03\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

Dowry would include property or valuable security which is\nactually given or which is agreed to be given, in relation to the marriage\nof a person in question. The property or valuable security may be given\nor may be agreed to be given before marriage or at the time of marriage\nor at any time after the marriage, so long as it is connected with the\nmarriage. However, there has to be a link between the property given or\nagreed to be given and the marriage. If at any time before or at the time\nof or even during marriage, the parents of a woman or any other person\nrelated or connected to her agree to give some cash, valuable security or\nproperty to her husband or in-laws after marriage, that also would be\ncovered within the definition of dowry as the agreement or promise in\nsuch a case would be attributable to the marriage or proposed marriage\nand if there is demand for any cash property, valuable security etc. which\nis promised, but not given, it would constitute demand for dowry. If the\nhusband of the girl or any other person related or connected to him,\ndemands something from the girl or her parents or any other person\nrelated to or connected with her, saying that the articles being demanded\nby them were expected to be given or ought to have been given in\nmarriage, that would also, to my mind, constitute demand of dowry\nbecause even though such an article may not have been agreed or\npromised to be given by the girl or her family members, it might have\nbeen in the contemplation of the boy and/or his family members, on\naccount of the expectation that such an article would be given at the time Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:18:09\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

Therefore, such demand would be considered to be a\ndemand in connection with the marriage though made after the marriage\nhas been solemnized.\n\n55. Even demands of articles such as T.V., fridge, jewellery, clothes,\nfurniture, etc. which usually are given or expected in marriages in our\ncountry, would, considering the objective sought to be achieved by\nincorporating Section 304B in \nIPC\n, 1860 and enacting \nDowry\nProhibition Act, 1961\n, fall within the purview of \nSection 304B\n of IPC,\n1860 .\n\n56. \nIn the case of \" \nPawan Kumar & Ors. v. State of Haryana\n\", AIR\n1998 SCC 958, the Apex Court has specifically held that demand of T.V.,\nFridge, etc. though not agreed to be given or promised or even demanded\nprior to or at the time of marriage, to be a demand for dowry for the\npurpose of \nSection 304B\n of Indian Penal Code. If cash or some property,\netc. is demanded by the boy or his family members, after marriage,\nsaying that they were expecting such cash, property, etc. to be given in\nmarriage, and the girl, or her parents or any other person related or\nconnected to her promise to fulfill such a demand, that also may fall\nwithin the purview of dowry, as the promise though made after marriage,\nwould nevertheless be referable to the marriage, having been made with\na view to preserve the marriage. In case, if the demand is made after\nmarriage and it is in respect of a property or valuable security, which was\nnot demanded, was not expected to be given and also was not in\ncontemplation at any time up to solemnization of marriage, demand of\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:18:17\n +0530\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

State of Punjab\n\", 200 14 Crimes 45\n(SC) while dealing with this issue, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, inter\nalia, observed as under:\n\n \"....... Thus, there are three occasions related to\n dowry. One is before the marriage, second is at the\n time of marriage and the third is \"at any time\" after\n the marriage. The third occasion may appear to be\n an unending period. But the crucial words are \"in\n connection with the marriage of the said parties\".\n\n This means that giving or agreeing to give any\n property or valuable security on any of the above\n three stages should have been in connection with\n the marriage of the parties. There can be many other\n instances for payment of money or giving property\n as between the spouses. For example, some\n customary payments in connection with birth of a\n child or other ceremonies are prevalent in different\n societies.

In view of the aforesaid definition of the word\n \"dowry\" any property or valuable security should be\n given or agreed to be given either directly or\n indirectly at or before or any time after the marriage\n and in connection with the marriage of the said\n parties. Therefore, the giving or taking of property\n or valuable security must have some connection\n with the marriage of the parties and a correlation\n between the giving or taking of property or valuable\n security with the marriage of the parties is essential.\n Being a penal provision it has to be strictly\n construed. Dowry is a fairly well known social\n custom or practice in India. It is well settled\n principle of interpretation of Statute that if the Act\n is passed with reference to a particular trade,\n business or transaction and words are used which\n everybody conversant with that trade, business or\n transaction knows or understands to have a\n particular meaning in it, then the words are to be\n construed as having that particular meaning........

The evidence adduced by the\n prosecution does not, therefore, show that any\n demand for \"dowry\" as defined in \nSection 2\n of the\n Dowry Prohibition Act was made by the appellants\n as what was allegedly asked for was some money\n for meeting domestic expenses and for purchasing\n manure.....\"\n\n59. The \nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860, and the \nDowry Prohibition Act,\n1961\n, are both remedial and penal statutes. As such, Courts are expected\nto construe the provisions in a way that the purpose is fulfilled through\nand within the limits of language employed in the statute. If a case is\nestablished then the Courts are to be stringent in dealing with the\nculprits. The Courts while taking a stringent view and despite the\nobligation of the legislative enactment a success, have also to keep in\nmind that the charge should be made out.\n\n60. The main ingredients to be proved for establishing a case under\n\nSection 304B\n of Indian Penal Code, 1860, are (i) unnatural death of a\nwoman within seven years of her marriage and (ii) she being subjected to\ncruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband, in\nconnection with any demand of dowry.\n\n61. The words \"it is shown\" occurring in \nSection 304B\n IPC, 1860, are\nof significance for the reason that the initial burden of proving the Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:18:37\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

This being shown or established, the question of\npresumption under \nSection 113B\n of the Evidence Act would arise. In\nother words, to draw a presumption under \nsection 113B\n of the Evidence\nAct, the necessary ingredient that need to be shown is that soon before\nthe death of the girl, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment in\nconnection with the demands of dowry, has to be proved. Only when\nthese facts are proved then by virtue of the deeming provision of \nsection\n304B\n IPC, the Court shall presume that the husband or any relative of\nthe husband had caused dowry death. Though cruelty at any time after\nthe marriage may cause depression in the mind of the victim, the cruelty\nand harassment envisaged by \nSection 304B\n IPC is to be 'soon before the\ndeath' of a woman.\n\n62. The Courts are required to scrutinize the evidence carefully\nbecause cases are not rare in which occasionally there is a demand and\nthen the atmosphere becomes calm and quiet and then again there is\ndemand. Where a wife dies in the house of her husband within a short\nspan of seven years of her marriage, it is of considerable difficulty to\nassess the precise circumstances in which the incident occurred because\nordinarily independent witnesses are not available as the torture and\nharassment is confined to the four walls of the house. The Courts are,\nhowever, required to be vigilant to scrutinize the evidence regarding the\nharassment and torture carefully if the witnesses are the relatives of the\ndeceased and relations between them and her in laws are strained for any\nreason whatever it might be.\n\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n 2024.09.20\n 13:18:43\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 73/110\n\n \n63. Urge for living is a natural phenomenon in mankind. A person\nwould not embrace death unless there is some psychological problem or\nmental agony or such circumstances that the person committing suicide\nmay think that life he or she is living is more miserable than the pangs\nand agony of death. The power of tolerance would vary from person to\nperson. Some persons try to make the life easy by tolerance while others\neven on petty points bring an end to their life. Reliance is placed upon\nthe judgment of the Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court reported as \"\nGurditta\nSingh v. The State of Rajasthan\n\", 1992 Crl. L. J. 309 .\n\n64. The importance of Proximity Test is both for the proof of an\noffence of 'dowry death' as well as for raising a presumption under\n\nSection 113B\n of the Evidence Act. The expression \"soon before her\ndeath\" used in the substantive \nsection 304B\n IPC and \nSection 113B\n\nEvidence Act is impregnated with the idea of proximity test. No definite\nperiod has been indicated with respect to the expression \" soon before\"\n\nused in \nSection 113B\n of the Evidence Act, however, Illustration (a) of the\nAct is relevant. The determination of the period which can come within\nthe term \"soon before\" is left to be determined by the Courts, depending\nupon the facts and circumstances of each case. Suffice, however, to\nindicate that the expression \"soon before\" would normally imply that the\ninterval should not be too much between the concerned cruelty or\nharassment and the death in question. There must be existence of a\nproximate and live link between the effect of cruelty based on dowry\ndemand and the concerned death.

Death can be accidental, suicidal or homicidal.\n\n The first type is a tragedy and no criminal\n complexion is conjured up, unless statutorily so\n devised, as in Section 304A; but even there the\n culpable act is that of the person actually causing\n the death. It seems to us that \nSection 304B\n of the\n IPC, inasmuch as it also takes within its\n contemplation \"the death of a woman ..... otherwise\n than under normal circumstances\", endeavours to\n cover murders masquerading as accidents.\n\n \nJustifiably, the suicidal death of a married woman\n who was meted out with cruelty by her husband,\n where her demise occurred within seven years of\n marriage in connection with a dowry demand\n should lead to prosecution and punishment under\n Sections 304B and/or 306 of the \nIPC\n. However, if\n the perfidious harassment and cruelty by the\n husband is conclusively proved by him to have had\n no causal connection with his cruel behaviour based\n on a dowry demand, these provisions are not\n attracted as held in \nBhagwan Das v. Kartar Singh\n\n (2007) 11 SCC 205, although some reservation may\n remain regarding the reach of Section 306.\n\n 10. It is already empirically evident that the Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:19:10\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 77/110\n prosecution, ubiquitously and in dereliction of duty,\n in the case of an abnormal death if a young bride\n confines its charges to Section 304B because the\n obligation to provide proof becomes least\n burdensome for it; this is the significance that\n attaches to a deeming provision. But, in any death\n other than in normal circumstances, we see no\n justification for not citing either Section 302 or\n Section 306, as the circumstances of the case call\n for. Otherwise, the death would logically fall in the\n category of an accidental one. It is not sufficient to\n include only Section 498A as the punishment is\n relatively light. Homicidal death is chargeable and\n punishable under Sections 302 and 304B if\n circumstances prevail triggering these provisions.\n \nThis Court has repeatedly reiterated this position,\n including in \nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n, 1991 (3)\n SCC 1 and quite recently in \nJasvinder Saini v. State\n (Govt. of NCT of Delhi\n) 2013 (7) SCC 256.\"\n\n67. The Court analyzed the provision of \nSec. 304B\n IPC considering it\nas a deeming provision and observed that the word ' shown' in \nSec. 304B\n\nIPC would connote 'prove'. It further observed as under:-\n\n \"14. .....It seems to us that what Parliament\n intended by using the word 'deemed' was that only\n preponderance of evidence would be insufficient to ATUL\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:19:18\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

This is also the\n postulation of \nSection 101\n of the Evidence Act. The\n purpose of \nSection 113B\n of the Evidence Act and\n \nSection 304B\n of the IPC, in our opinion, is to\n counter what is commonly encountered - the lack or\n the absence of evidence in the case of suicide or\n death of a woman within seven years of marriage. If\n the word \"shown\" has to be given its ordinary\n meaning then it would only require the prosecution\n to merely present its evidence in Court, not\n necessarily through oral deposition, and thereupon\n make the accused lead detailed evidence to be\n followed by that of the prosecution. This procedure\n is unknown to Common Law systems, and beyond\n the contemplation of the \nCr.P.C\n.\"\n\n68. In the background of the above, I shall now discuss the evidence\nbrought on record in the present case. It is trite law that the accused\npersons can be convicted on the basis of credible evidence brought on\nrecord and the appreciation of the said evidence must be done in correct\nand true perspective manner and in the natural course of events, what\nwould have been occurred. Appreciation of evidence beyond reasonable\ndoubt does not mean that it should be assessed beyond any iota of doubt.\n\nBeyond Reasonable Doubt means that the prosecution is required to Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n 2024.09.20\n 13:19:25\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 79/110\n\n \nplace evidence at a higher degree of preponderance of probabilities\ncompared to what is degree of preponderance of probability in civil\ncases. The theory of Beyond Reasonable Doubt means expecting higher\ndegree of preponderance of probabilities and the natural conduct of\nhuman beings, as held by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in \"\nState\nof Karnataka Vs Venkatesh @ Venkappa & Anr\n\" , Criminal Appeal No.\n100492 of 2021, decided on 18.12.2023.\n\n69. \nSection 3\n of the Indian Evidence Act defines \"evidence\". The\nevidence can be broadly divided into oral and documentary. \"Evidence\"\nunder the Act can be said to include the means, factor or material,\nlending a degree of probability through a logical inference to the\nexistence of a fact. It is an adjective law highlighting and aiding the\nsubstantive law. Thus, it is neither wholly procedural nor substantive,\nthough trappings of both could be felt.\n\n70. The definition of the word \"proved\" though gives an impression of\na mere interpretation, in effect, is the heart and soul of the entire Act.\nThis clause, consciously speaks of proving a fact by considering the\n\"matters before it\". The importance is attached to the degree of\nprobability in proving a fact through the consideration of the matters\nbefore the court. What is required for a court to decipher is the existence\nof a fact and its proof by a degree of probability, through a logical\ninference.\n\n71. Matters are necessary, concomitant material factors to prove a fact.

FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 80/110\n All \"evidence\" would be \"matters\" but not vice versa. In other words,\nmatters could be termed as a genus of which evidence would be a\nspecies. Matters also adds strength to the evidence giving adequate\nammunition in the Court's sojourn in deciphering the truth. Thus, the\ndefinition of \"matters\" is exhaustive, and therefore, much wider than that\nof \"evidence\". However, there is a caveat, as the court is not supposed to\nconsider a matter which acquires the form of an evidence when it is\nbarred in law. Matters are required for a court to believe in the existence\nof a fact.\n\n72. Matters, do give more discretion and flexibility to the court in\ndeciding the existence of a fact. They also include all the classification of\nevidence such as circumstantial evidence, corroborative evidence,\nderivative evidence, direct evidence, documentary evidence, hearsay\nevidence, indirect evidence, oral evidence, original evidence,\npresumptive evidence, primary evidence, real evidence, secondary\nevidence, substantive evidence, testimonial evidence, etc.\n\n73. In addition, they supplement the evidence in proving the existence\nof a fact by enhancing the degree of probability. As an exhaustive\ninterpretation has to be given to the word \"matter\", and for that purpose,\nthe definition of the expression of the words \"means and includes\",\nmeant to be applied for evidence, has to be imported to that of a \"matter\"\nas well. Thus, a matter might include such of those which do not fall\nwithin the definition of \nSection 3\n, in the absence of any express bar.\n\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n 2024.09.20\n 13:19:40\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 81/110\n\n 74. What is important for the court is the conclusion on the basis of\nexistence of a fact by analyzing the matters before it on the degree of\nprobability. The entire enactment is meant to facilitate the court to come\nto an appropriate conclusion in proving a fact. There are two methods by\nwhich the court is expected to come to such a decision. The court can\ncome to a conclusion on the existence of a fact by merely considering the\nmatters before it, in forming an opinion that it does exist. This belief of\nthe court is based upon the assessment of the matters before it.\nAlternatively, the court can consider the said existence as probable from\nthe perspective of a prudent man who might act on the supposition that it\nexists. The question as to the choice of the options is best left to the court\nto decide. The said decision might impinge upon the quality of the\nmatters before it.\n\n75. The word \"prudent\" has not been defined under the Act. When the\ncourt wants to consider the second part of the definition clause instead of\nbelieving the existence of a fact by itself, it is expected to take the role of\na prudent man. Such a prudent man has to be understood from the point\nof view of a common man. Therefore, a judge has to transform into a\nprudent man and assess the existence of a fact after considering the\nmatters through that lens instead of a judge. It is only after undertaking\nthe said exercise can he resume his role as a judge to proceed further in\nthe case.\n\n76. The aforesaid provision also indicates that the court is concerned\nwith the existence of a fact both in issue and relevant, as against a whole\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:19:48\n +0530\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 82/110\n testimony. Thus, the concentration is on the proof of a fact for which a\nwitness is required. Therefore, a court can appreciate and accept the\ntestimony of a witness on a particular issue while rejecting it on others\nsince it focuses on an issue of fact to be proved. However, the evidence\nof a witness as whole is a matter for the court to decide on the\nprobability of proving a fact which is inclusive of the credibility of the\nwitness. Whether an issue is concluded or not is also a court's domain.\n\n77. While appreciating the evidence as aforesaid along with the matters\nattached to it, evidence can be divided into three categories broadly\nnamely, (i) wholly reliable, (ii) wholly unreliable and (iii) neither wholly\nreliable nor wholly unreliable. If evidence, along with matters\nsurrounding it, makes the court believe it is wholly reliable qua an issue,\nit can decide its existence on a degree of probability. Similar is the case\nwhere evidence is not believable. When evidence produced is neither\nwholly reliable nor wholly unreliable, it might require corroboration, and\nin such a case, court can also take note of the contradictions available in\nother matters. The aforesaid principle of law has been enunciated in the\nauthority of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in \"\nVadivelu Thevar v.\nState of Madras\n \", 1957 SCR 981 wherein it is held as under:\n\n \"In view of these considerations, we have no\n hesitation in holding that the contention that in a\n murder case, the court should insist upon plurality\n of witnesses, is much too broadly stated. \nSection\n 134\n of the Indian Evidence Act has categorically\n laid it down that \"no particular number of witnesses\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:19:55\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 83/110\n shall in any case, be required for the proof of any\n fact\". The legislature determined, as long ago as\n 1872, presumably after due consideration of the\n pros and cons, that it shall not be necessary for\n proof or disproof of a fact to call any particular\n number of witnesses. In England, both before and\n after the passing of the \nIndian Evidence Act, 1872\n,\n there have been a number of statutes as set out in\n Sarkar's Law of Evidence -- 9th Edn., at pp. 1100\n and 1101, forbidding convictions on the testimony\n of a single witness. The Indian Legislature has not\n insisted on laying down any such exceptions to the\n general rule recognized in\n s.134\n quoted above. The\n section enshrines the well-recognized maxim that\n \"Evidence has to be weighed and not counted\". Our\n Legislature has given statutory recognition to the\n fact that administration of justice may be hampered\n if a particular number of witnesses were to be\n insisted upon. It is not seldom that a crime has been\n committed in the presence of only one witness,\n leaving aside those cases which are not of\n uncommon occurrence, where determination of\n guilt depends entirely on circumstantial evidence. If\n the Legislature were to insist upon plurality of\n witnesses, cases where the testimony of a single\n witness only could be available in proof of the Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n AHLAWAT\n ATUL\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:20:02\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 84/110\n crime, would go unpunished. It is here that the\n discretion of the presiding judge comes into play.\n\n The matter thus must depend upon the\n circumstances of each case and the quality of the\n evidence of the single witness whose testimony has\n to be either accepted or rejected. If such a testimony\n is found by the court to be entirely reliable, there is\n no legal impediment to the conviction of the\n accused person on such proof. Even as the guilt of\n an accused person may be proved by the testimony\n of a single witness, the innocence of an accused\n person may be established on the testimony of a\n single witness, even though a considerable number\n of witnesses may be forthcoming to testify to the\n truth of the case for the prosecution. Hence, in our\n opinion, it is a sound and well-established rule of\n law that the court is concerned with the quality and\n not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for\n proving or disproving a fact. Generally speaking,\n oral testimony in this context may be classified into\n three categories, namely:\n\n (1) Wholly reliable.\n\n (2) Wholly unreliable.\n\n (3) Neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.\n\n In the first category of proof, the court should have ATUL\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:20:08\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 85/110\n no difficulty in coming to its conclusion either way\n\n -- it may convict or may acquit on the testimony of\n a single witness, if it is found to be above reproach\n or suspicion of interestedness, incompetence or\n subornation. In the second category, the court,\n equally has no difficulty in coming to its\n conclusion. It is in the third category of cases, that\n the court has to be circumspect and has to look for\n corroboration in material particulars by reliable\n testimony, direct or circumstantial. There is another\n danger in insisting on plurality of witnesses.\n Irrespective of the quality of the oral evidence of a\n single witness, if courts were to insist on plurality of\n witnesses in proof of any fact, they will be\n indirectly encouraging subornation of witnesses.\n Situations may arise and do arise where only a\n single person is available to give evidence in\n support of a disputed fact. The court naturally has to\n weigh carefully such a testimony and if it is\n satisfied that the evidence is reliable and free from\n all taints which tend to render oral testimony open\n to suspicion, it becomes its duty to act upon such\n testimony. The law reports contain many precedents\n where the court had to depend and act upon the\n testimony of a single witness in support of the\n prosecution. There are exceptions to this rule, for\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:20:15\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 86/110\n example, in cases of sexual offences or of the\n testimony of an approver; both these are cases in\n which the oral testimony is, by its very nature,\n suspect, being that of a participator in crime. But,\n where there are no such exceptional reasons\n operating, it becomes the duty of the court to\n convict, if it is satisfied that the testimony of a\n single witness is entirely reliable. We have,\n therefore, no reasons to refuse to act upon the\n testimony of the first witness, which is the only\n reliable evidence in support of the prosecution.\"\n\nAppreciation of Evidence:\n\n78. In the present case, the accused persons are facing the charges of\nthe offences punishable\n u/s 498A\n/\n304-B\n/\n34\n IPC, 1860, for having\ncommitted the dowry death of the deceased Nisha and for committing\ncruelty upon her before her death.\n\n79. In the present case, the date of marriage between the deceased and\nher husband accused Sandeep is not disputed and the accused persons\nhave duly admitted the marriage invitation card dated 19.04.2012\nalongwith the list of dowry articles in their statements recorded\n u/s 294\n\nCr.PC and the same were exhibited as Ex. PX-6 (colly). Therefore, it is\nestablished by the prosecution that the deceased Nisha got married to\naccused Sandeep on 19.04.2012. Furthermore, it is also not disputed that Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:20:23\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors.

PX-2, which is also one of the\nadmitted documents, being duly admitted by the accused persons\n u/s 294\n\nCr.PC on 01.02.2024. Therefore, it is established beyond reasonable\ndoubt that the death of the deceased Nisha took place within 7 years of\nher marriage.\n\n80. So as to attract the presumption of law enshrined under \nsection\n113-B\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, from the statements of the\nuncles of the deceased namely Pramod Kumar and Satender, Ex. PW2/A\nand Ex. PW6/A, recorded before the concerned SDM/Executive\nMagistrate were enough and the prosecution had to discharge the initial\nburden of proof after establishing the essential ingredients mentioned in\n\nSection 113-B\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which the prosecution\nhas been able to meet in the present case.\n\n81. The death of the deceased Nisha was duly proved by the\nprosecution through the MLC Ex. PW30/A, wherein, she was brought to\nthe main casualty, GTB Hospital in unconscious and unresponsive state\nwith alleged history of hanging. Upon local examination, bruises marks\nwere found at anterior aspect of her neck. The postmortem report no.\n1635/2014 is an admitted document and same was exhibited as Ex. PX-\n\n2. As per the postmortem report, upon the neck of the dead body, the\nconcerned doctor found extravasation of blood in soft tissue of neck,\nbruising of muscles, epiglottis was found to be congested and\nosteocartilaginous structure of the neck was found to be intact.

FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 88/110\n opinion of the concerned doctor, the cause of death was \"Asphyxia as as\nresult of ante-mortem hanging\".\n\n82. It is also not disputed in the present case that the deceased had\nhanged herself by trying an end of the chunni around her neck and the\nother end of the chunni around the ceiling fan of the room situated on the\nground floor of the matrimonial house of the deceased. It is not the case\nof the prosecution that the deceased was killed by the accused persons or\nthat she was hanged after she had been already killed. There are no\nallegations of the offence punishable\n u/s 302\n IPC, 1860 against the\naccused persons. The fact that the deceased committed suicide by\nhanging, has not been disputed by the accused persons. Therefore, the\nprosecution has been able to fully establish that the deceased Nisha had\ndied otherwise then in normal circumstances, since committing suicide is\nnot the end of the human life under normal circumstances. Furthermore,\nsince the date of marriage is also not disputed by the accused persons\nand they had admitted the marriage invitation card Ex. PX (colly), in\nwhich the date of the marriage is duly mentioned as 19.04.2012.\n\nTherefore, the death of the deceased Nisha, which has been established\nthrough the PM report Ex. PX2 took place on 30.11.2014, therefore, it is\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died within 7\nyears of her marriage and her death had occurred otherwise than under\nnormal circumstances. Therefore, the only thing that needs to be now\nappreciated from the evidence brought on record, is that whether the\nprosecution is able to establish that soon before her death, deceased\nNisha was subjected to cruelty and harassment by her husband or any Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:20:41\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

The prosecution is relying heavily on the testimony of star\nwitnesses i.e. PW2 Pramod Kumar, PW6 Satender, PW9 Devendra\nKumar and PW12 Sonu Kumar, to establish that soon before her death,\nthe deceased Nisha was subjected to cruelty and harassment in\nconnection with dowry demands.\n\n84. It has come in the testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar, who is the\ncomplainant of the present case that he had taken the deceased in\nadoption and ever since her childhood, deceased Nisha stayed with him\nand he had taken care of the deceased and finally got her married to\naccused Sandeep on 19.04.2012. There are specific allegations leveled\nby him in his complaint Ex. PW2/A, recorded before the concerned\nSDM. The concerned SDM had also recorded the statement of the\nbrother of PW2 Pramod Kumar, namely PW6 Satender and in his\nstatement Ex.

It has also come from the testimony of PW12 Sonu Kumar that he\nhad visited the matrimonial house of the deceased on 29.11.2014 at\nabout 07.30 PM, to deliver the marriage invitation card, since his\nyounger brother Gaurav was getting married on 01.12.2014.

The phone calls exchanged between the accused Sandeep, PW6\nSatender, PW2 Pramod Kumar and DW1 Chawan Singh @ Chaman\nwere duly proved by the prosecution.

Similarly the CAF and CDR of\nmob. no. 9899515424, also belonging to accused Sandeep were admitted\nand exhibited as Ex. PX5.

Lastly, mobile no. 9015116162 was issued in the name of the\nhusband of accused Alka, namely Anuj Chokhar and same was duly\nproved by the prosecution through the testimony of PW23 Amit Kumar\nSharma.\n\n Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:08\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

The testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender qua the\ncalls received by them and the fact that the deceased had informed them\nabout the beatings received by her, one day prior to her death and the\nsaid harassment was with respect to dowry demands, was corroborated\nthrough the testimony of other prosecution witnesses i.e. PW9 Devendra\nKumar, who is the father of the deceased.\n\n92. The testimony of PW2 and PW6 has to be appreciated in the\nbackground of the testimony of other prosecution witnesses, wherein,\nthey had leveled specific allegations against the accused Sandeep making\ndowry demands from the family members of the deceased.\n\n93. It has come in the testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar, PW6\nSatender and PW9 Devendra Kumar that one month after the deceased\ngave birth to a child, accused Sandeep left her back at the house of her\nchacha PW2 Pramod Kumar and did not return back for a long time. He\nraised a demand of Rs. 2 lacs from PW2 Pramod Kumar as a condition\nprecedent for taking his wife and child back to his house. PW2 Pramod\nKumar arranged the said amount in cash from his cousin brother PW10\nRajesh Kumar. The testimony of PW10 Rajesh Kumar is also categorical\nin nature and he had fully corroborated the testimony of PW2 Pramod\nKumar on this aspect.\n\n94. The testimony of PW13 Mannu, who is the cousin brother of the\ngrand father of the deceased, is also corroborating the testimony of PW2 Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:16\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 94/110\n Pramod Kumar and other prosecution witnesses such as PW6 Satender\nand PW9 Devendra Kumar on the aspect of dowry demands being raised\nupon the deceased and that she was subjected to harassment and cruelty\nas the deceased had told him personally about the same. It has\ncategorically come in his testimony that \"I used to talk with Nisha\nwhenever she used to visit the house of Pramod there at Budheda. She\nused to complain against her husband and her in-laws regarding demand\nof dowry.\" His testimony is not merely hear-say, as argued by the Ld.\nCounsel for the accused persons.\n\n95. It is being argued on behalf of the State that the phone calls made\nbetween accused Sandeep and PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender\non 29.11.2014, wherein, the deceased had informed her uncles about the\nbeatings received by her at the hands of the accused persons on the\naccount of dowry demands, constitute dying declaration. Careful perusal\nof the testimony brought on record by the prosecution, clearly reflects\nthat the deceased had allegedly disclosed to her uncles PW2 Pramod\nKumar and PW6 Satender that she was beaten up by the accused persons\nand from the said statement, it cannot be held that the deceased had\ngiven her mind as to the said beatings had driven her to such an extent\nthat she was going to commit suicide on the very next day. There is no\ncircumstance surrounding her death, that is disclosed in the said alleged\nstatement, therefore, the same cannot be held to be a dying declaration.\n\n96. As far as the allegations against accused Sandeep is concerned,\nfrom the testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender, the Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:23\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 95/110\n prosecution has been able to establish that he had subjected the deceased\nto harassment, soon before her death and that the demands of dowry\nwere being raised. The said allegations were duly corroborated by the\nCDR and CAF of the mobile phones being used by accused Sandeep,\nPW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender.\n\n97. However, as far as the other accused persons are concerned, the\nallegations are cryptic and vague in nature and it does not inspire any\nconfidence. The initial burden of proof lied on the prosecution and the\nburden would not shift on the accused persons, merely on the fact that\nunnatural death had occurred within 7 years of marriage, without even\nproving the dowry demand prior to the incident. However, in the present\ncase, the prosecution has been able to discharge its initial burden of\nproving the demand of dowry prior to the incident. There is only one\nspecific allegation against accused Vikram Devi @ Krishana that around\n7-8 days prior to the marriage between her son accused Sandeep and the\ndeceased, she had raised a demand of a car on PW2 Pramod Kumar.\nThereafter, all the allegations against her are cryptic in nature and no\nspecific allegations with any date, time etc., were leveled against her.\n\n98. Similarly, as far as accused Jagat Singh is concerned there are only\ngeneral and cryptic allegations that he had raised the dowry demands\nalong with other co-accused persons and that he had also given beatings\nto the deceased on 29.11.2014. Furthermore, there are also general and\ncryptic allegations of him being involved in committing harassment and\ntorture of the deceased, prior to her death. It has come in the testimony Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:29\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 96/110\n of PW-6 Satender that after he had received a phone call from accused\nSandeep and when he was made to speak to his niece Nisha, he had\ngiven a call on the mobile phone of accused Jagat Singh and requested\nhim not to torture his niece. Further, making a phone call to the father-in-\nlaw of the deceased is quite normal in ordinary circumstances, as it\nmight have been made to get his son Sandeep reprimanded, in the hope\nthat he changes his behaviour towards his wife Nisha and merely making\na phone call does not suggest involvement of accused Jagat Singh,\nespecially when except the testimony of PW6 Satender qua making the\nsaid phone call, there is no material evidence brought on record to show\nhis involvement.\n\n99. Furthermore, the said fact was not corroborated in the testimony of\nthe complainant PW-2 Pramod Kumar or PW9 Devendra Kumar. The\nfactum of the said call was also not stated by complainant in his\nstatement Ex. PW2/A before the concerned SDM. Furthermore,\nregarding the said call made by PW-6 Satender to the accused Jagat\nSingh was an improvement from his earlier statement Ex. PW6/A\nrecorded before the concerned SDM. Furthermore, the prosecution did\nnot bring on record any CAF/CDR of the mobile phone of the accused\nJagat Singh, to prove that the said call was made to him by PW-6\nSatender.\n\n100. Similarly, the allegations leveled against accused Alka and Rekha\nare also vague and cryptic in nature and the same also does not inspire\nany confidence. It is not disputed that both of them were married and Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:36\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 97/110\n living separately at their respective matrimonial houses. The only\nexplanation given by the prosecution regarding their involvement is that\ntheir respective matrimonial houses were situated near the matrimonial\nhouse of the deceased and that both of them were having a lot of say in\nthe matrimonial life of their brother accused Sandeep and deceased\nNisha. There are general allegations of accused Alka and Rekha raising\ndowry demands upon the deceased, along with their other family\nmembers.\n\n101. As per the testimony of the PW-2 Pramod Kumar and PW-6\nSatender Kumar, they were both allegedly informed by the deceased on\n29.11.2014, that both accused Alka and Rekha were present in her\nmatrimonial home and they along-with their other family members gave\nbeatings to the deceased. However, it is also the case of the prosecution\nthat PW-12 Sonu Kumar had visited the house of the accused persons on\n29.11.2014 to deliver a marriage invitation card and when he met the\ndeceased, he was informed that some quarrel had taken place and her\nhusband and her in laws were harassing her on account of demand of\ndowry. During his cross examination conducted by Ld. Defense counsel\non 07.07.2018, PW-12 Sonu Kumar had categorically admitted that on\nthat day when he visited the matrimonial house of the deceased, he met\naccused Sandeep, Vikram Devi, Mahesh and Jagat. There was no\nmention of accused Rekha and Alka being present there and except for\nthe testimony of PW-2 and PW-6, their presence in the matrimonial\nhouse of the deceased on 29.11.2014 could not be proved. There are\ninherent contradictions in the statements of the prosecution witnesses Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:44\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 98/110\n and accordingly the statement of PW2 and PW6 cannot be believed as\nfar as the involvement of the accused Rekha and Alka giving beatings to\nthe deceased Nisha on 29.11.2014 or they have tortured the deceased on\nthe demands of dowry.\n\n102. It is not disputed that certain dowry articles were exchanged at the\ntime of the marriage of the deceased, since the accused persons had\ncategorically admitted the list of dowry articles Ex. PX-6 (colly), along-\n\nwith the original marriage card, vide their statements recorded\n u/s 294\n\nCr.P.C on 01.02.2024. The allegations against accused Vikram Devi @\nKrishana of raising a demand of a car, prior to 7-8 days of the marriage\nis sought to be proved by the prosecution. All the material public\nwitnesses, including PW-2 Pramod Kumar, PW-6 Satender and PW-9\nDevendra Kumar have categorically deposed qua the same. The receipt\nof the Alto car is not disputed by the accused persons. However, there\nare no charges framed\n u/s 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961\nagainst the accused persons and they are not facing trial for raising the\nsaid dowry demands. Except for the said demand of a car, the\nprosecution could not bring on record any other cogent evidence to show\nthe involvement of the accused Vikram Devi @ Krishana in raising\nfurther demands of dowry and committing torture/harassment of the\ndeceased in relation with the said dowry demands.\n\n103. It is trite law as laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India\nin catena of judgments that \nsection 304-B\n IPC must be interpreted\nkeeping in mind the legislative intent to curb the social evil of bride Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:52\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 99/110\n burning and dowry demand. The prosecution must at first establish the\nexistence of the necessary ingredients constituting an offence punishable\n\nu/s 304-B\n IPC. Once these ingredients are satisfied, the rebuttable\npresumption of causality, provided\n u/s 113-B\n of Indian Evidence Act,\n1872 operates against the accused persons.\n\n104. As discussed above, the phrase \"soon before\" as appearing in\n\nsection 304-B\n IPC cannot be construed to mean \" immediately before\".\nThe prosecution must establish existence of \"proximate and live link\"\n\nbetween the dowry death and cruelty or harassment for dowry demand\nby her husband or relatives of the husband.\n\n105. \nSection 304-B\n IPC does not provide a pigeon hole of an offence in\ncategorizing the death as homicidal or suicidal or accidental. The death\nof the deceased could fall under any of the three scenarios yet it could\namount to occur \"otherwise than under normal circumstances\".\n\n106. Conjoint reading of \nsection 304-B\n IPC and \nsection 113-B\n Indian\nEvidence Act, thus predicate the burden of the prosecution to\nunassailably substantiate the ingredients of the two sections, by direct\nand convincing evidence, so as to avail the presumption engrafted under\nthe law against the accused persons. Proof of cruelty or harassment by\nthe husband or his relatives charged is thus the sine qua non to invoke\nthe spirit of the said statutory presumption. If the prosecution fails to\ndemonstrate with cogent, coherent and persuasive evidence to prove the\nsame, the accused person cannot be held guilty of taking refuge only Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:21:59\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 100/110\n upon the presumption to cover up the short fall in its efforts to prove the\ncase of the prosecution.\n\n107. The presumption of law as laid down in \nsection 113-B\n of Indian\nEvidence Act, 1872 was upon the wisdom of the legislature of relieving\nthe prosecution of the rigor of proof, of often practically inaccessible\nevidence, which was guarded within the closed confines of the\nmatrimonial home. However, in absence of cogent evidence spelling out\nthe ingredients of the offence, especially the most essential ingredient of\nharassment/cruelty soon before the death, against any of the accused\npersons, does not shift the burden to meet the reverse onus upon them.\n\n108. In the facts of the present case, it seems that accused Jagat Singh,\nVikram Devi @ Krishana, Mahesh Chand, Alka and Rekha have been\nroped in only because of their close relationship with accused Sandeep\n(husband of the deceased). Accused Mahesh Chand is the elder brother\nof accused Sandeep and he was already married and living separately\nwith his family. As far as accused Alka and Rekha are concerned, they\nwere the nanads of the deceased and they were also married and living\nseparately in their respective matrimonial houses. They also had no say\nor only a little say, as far as the matrimonial dispute between their\nbrother accused Sandeep and deceased was concerned, wherein, the\ndeceased was being tortured by her husband accused Sandeep.\nTherefore, the prosecution could not establish through cogent and\ncoherent evidence of accused Jagat Singh, Vikram Devi @ Krishana,\nMahesh Chand, Alka and Rekha of having committed the Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:05\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 101/110\n cruelty/harassment upon the deceased Nisha, soon before her death.\nTherefore, no reverse onus could be introduced against them to refute the\ncase of the prosecution and to prove their innocence.\n\n109. However, through the clear and unimpeachable evidence of dowry\ndemands raised by the accused Sandeep, six month after the birth of his\nson and him being given Rs. 2 lacs by PW-2 Pramod Kumar as a\ncondition precedent of him taking his wife and child back home, coupled\nwith the categorical testimonies of PW-2 Pramod Kumar and PW-6\nSatender, when appreciated with the testimony of PW-12 Sonu Kumar\nand further corroborated by the CDR of accused Sandeep, PW-2 Pramod\nKumar and PW-6 Satender, in the considered opinion of this Court, the\nprosecution has been able to discharge this burden that soon before her\ndeath, accused Sandeep had committed cruelty/harassment upon the\ndeceased Nisha on the demands of dowry. Hence, all the essential\ningredients of the offence punishable\n u/s 304-B\n IPC are established by\nthe prosecution. Therefore, reverse onus is casted upon accused Sandeep,\nto refute the case of the prosecution and prove his innocence.\n\n110. It is trite law that the accused person can take two contradictory\ndefenses and the same is not a taboo under the law. In the present case,\nthe accused Sandeep has taken different defenses and the same shall be\nappreciated here, to see whether he is able to refute the presumption of\nlaw raised against him.\n\n111. The first defense taken up by accused Sandeep is that the deceased Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:13\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 102/110\n Nisha was a short tempered girl and that she used to insist to go to a\nbeauty parlour, however, when she was refused/not allowed to go to the\nsaid beauty parlour, she committed suicide on 30.11.2014. The said\ndefense of the accused Sandeep, does not inspire any confidence in the\nmind of this Court, since nothing material was brought on record by the\naccused person to substantiate his defense. Furthermore, there is not\neven an iota of evidence brought on record, wherein, the desire of the\ndeceased to visit a beauty parlor could be established. Furthermore, it is\ndifficult to fathom that a young woman, who had an infant son, would\ntake her own life, just because she was not allowed to visit a beauty\nparlor. The said defense is so improbable that no reasonable prudent\nperson would believe the same. Furthermore, the defense could not\nestablish that the deceased was a short tempered girl. Lastly, the said\ndefense was in the form of suggestions given to PW2 Pramod Kumar,\nwho is the complainant of the present case and the said defense was not\ngiven as suggestions to the other material prosecution witnesses.\n\n112. The second line of defense adopted by the accused persons was\nthat the deceased was below 18 years of age at the time of her marriage\nand her marriage was solemnized against her wishes. Therefore, she was\nnot happy with her marriage and subsequently committed suicide. It is\ntrue that through the testimony of DW2 Kanwar Pal Singh, it was\nbrought on record that the date of birth of the deceased was 01.07.1996.\nHer marriage admittedly took place on 19.04.2012, therefore, the defense\nwas able to establish that the deceased was a minor at the time of her\nmarriage. However, merely because her age is proved, does not ipso Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:21\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 103/110\n facto establish that her consent was not there and she was married by her\nfamily members against her wishes. The marriage of a minor Hindu girl\nis a valid marriage in the eyes of law. The said marriage is merely\npunishable under the law, however, the marriage itself was not a nullity.\nThe said marriage is neither void nor voidable under the provisions of\nthe \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n. The said marriage could have been\nvoidable at the instance of the contracting party, who was a child at the\ntime of the marriage i.e. the deceased Nisha, as per \nsection 3\n of the\nProhibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Furthermore, the marriage was\nduly consummated and the deceased was blessed with a baby boy. There\nis not even a shred of evidence to show that the deceased was married\nagainst her wishes or that she was unhappy with her marriage with\naccused Sandeep and that due to the said discontent, she went to the\nextent of ending her life prematurely. Therefore, the said defense of the\naccused persons is also liable to be rejected, as it does not inspire any\nconfidence.\n\n113. There is no merit in the arguments raised by the Ld. Defense\ncounsel regarding the credibility of the star prosecution witnesses. The\nminor contradictions and improvements are not of such nature so as to\nstrike at the very root of the case of the prosecution. The minor\ncontradictions such as the discrepancy in the date of the marriage of the\ndeceased with accused Sandeep is immaterial, since the date of marriage\nis not disputed in the present case and same was admitted by the accused\npersons in their statements recorded\n u/s 294\n Cr.PC. The contradictions\nand improvements qua the place of birth of the deceased, her age, her Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:28\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 104/110\n educational qualifications and the schools that were attended by her is\nalso of no consequence to the facts of the present case, since the same\nwas not the moot point of adjudication. It made little or no difference\nthat the deceased was adopted by her chacha PW2 Pramod or not.\nFurthermore, it was immaterial whether she stayed in her village or in\nDelhi prior to her marriage. The moot question in the present case was\nwhether the deceased was married to accused Sandeep and whether she\ndied otherwise than in normal circumstances, within 7 years of her\nmarriage. Furthermore, the last material question to be ascertained was\nthat whether she was subjected to cruelty/harassment in connection with\nthe demands of dowry, soon before her death. Rest everything, relating\nto her life prior to her marriage was not relevant for the purpose of the\ninquiry in the present case.\n\n114. The other improvements/contradictions such as the date of the\nphone call received by PW2 Pramod Kumar and PW6 Satender was also\nnot material, since \"soon before\" could be satisfied by either 28.11.2014\nor 29.11.2014. The fact that said phone calls were received on\n29.11.2014 and the same was proved by the prosecution through the\ncorroborative evidence such as CDR and CAF of the mobile phones, had\nduly established that the said phone calls were received by the family\nmembers of the deceased, soon before her death. Therefore, the\ntestimony of PW2 and PW6 was substantially corroborated by the\nmaterial relevant evidence brought on record by the prosecution and\nmerely because in their statements before the SDM, both PW2 and PW6\nhad stated that the said calls were received on 28.11.2014 and not on Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:34\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 105/110\n 29.11.2014, does not have any bearing on their credibility and the\noutcome of the present case.\n\n115. The death of the deceased took place within the closed confines of\nthe room in her matrimonial house. The accused Sandeep was expected\nto come out with an explanation as to how the deceased had died. The\nsaid explanation is warranted in view of \nsection 106\n of the Indian\nEvidence Act, 1872 R/w \nsection 313\n of Cr.PC. In his statement\n u/s 313\n\nCr.PC, there are general and evasive replies to the incriminating\nevidence brought on record against him in the present case. He had\nsimplicitor denied all the questions being put him and he had merely\nstated that since all the witnesses were interested witnesses, they had\nfalsely deposed against him. The explanation offered by him, as far as\npertaining to the suicide committed by the deceased is not tenable.\n\nTherefore, in the view of this Court, in light of the statutory presumption\n\nu/s 113-B\n of Indian Evidence Act, 1872 R/w \nsection 106\n and \nsection\n114(h)\n of the Indian Evidence Act, further adverse inference is drawn\nagainst him. The accused Sandeep has failed to discharge the burden of\nthe reverse onus clause.\n\nConclusion & Findings:\n\n116. As per the celebrated judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in \"Sharad Birdichand Sarda Vs. State of Maharastra\" AIR 1984\nSC 1622, the five golden rules of circumstantial evidence were\nelucidated, wherein, it was held that the onus remains on the prosecution\nto prove the complete chain of events which shall undoubtedly come Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:41\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs.

Each and every\nincriminating circumstance must be clearly established by reliable and\nclinching evidence and circumstances so proved must form a chain of\nevents from which the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt of\naccused should be safely drawn and no other hypothesis in favour of the\naccused persons must be there. \nReliance is placed upon the decision of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in \"\nWakkar Vs. State of UP\n \" (2011)\n3 SCC 306 and \"Sahadeven Vs. State of Tamil Nadu \" AIR 2012 SC\n2435.\n\n117. In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is that\nthe circumstantial from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be\nfully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature.\n\nMoreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be\nno gap left in the chain of evidence. Further, the proved circumstances\nmust be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused\nand totally inconsistent with his innocence, as held by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India in \"Hanuman Govind Nargundkar Vs. State of\nMP\" AIR 1952 SC 343, \"Bodh Raj Vs. State of J&K\" \nAIR 2002 SC\n3164 and \"Sharad Birdhichand Sarda Vs. State of Maharashtra\n\" AIR\n1984 SC 1622 and \"C. Chenga Reddy and Ors. Vs. State of A.P.\" (1996)\n10 SCC 193.\n\n118. It is also settled law that accused has to only probabilize the Digitally\n signed by\n ATUL\n ATUL AHLAWAT\n AHLAWAT Date:\n\n 2024.09.20\n 13:22:50\n +0530\n\nCNR No. DLNE01-000091-2015 State Vs. Sandeep & Ors. FIR No. 1665/2014 Page no. 107/110\n defense and he is presumed to be innocent till he is proved to be guilty.\nSuspicion, however, strong can never take place of proof. There is\nindeed a long distance between accused \"May have committed the\noffence\" and \"Must have committed the offence\", which must be\ntraversed by the prosecution by adducing reliable evidence. \nEmphasis is\nsupplied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\"\nKailash Gaur Vs. State of Assam\n\" (\n2012) 2 SCC 34 and \"Padala Veera\nReddy Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh\n\" AIR 1990 SC 79. In the present\ncase, the prosecution has been able to travel the long distance from\n\"may\" to \"must\" by leading reliable evidence qua accused Sandeep\nthrough the testimony of PW2 Pramod Kumar, PW6 Satender, PW9\nDevendra Kumar, PW10 Rajesh Kumar, PW12 Sonu Kumar, PW13\nMannu and PW21 Ajeet Singh. Their testimonies were fully supported\nand corroborated by the medical evidence i.e. the postmortem report Ex.\nPX-2 and the subsequent opinion Ex. PX-3.\n\n119. There is another golden thread which runs through the web of\nadministration of justice in criminal cases, is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of\nthe accused and other to his innocence, the view which is favourable to\nthe accused should be adopted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndia in \"Kali Ram Vs. State of Himanchal Pradesh\" AIR 1973 SC\n2773. In the facts of the present case, the prosecution was able to prove\nall the material links of the chain of circumstantial evidence and the said\nchain pointed towards the guilt of accused Sandeep and no other\nhypothesis inconsistent with his guilt could be brought on record.

The falsity of the\nallegations in the said FIR came to light during the investigation and\nultimately the police proceeded ahead to file the cancellation report in\nthe said case FIR. The cancellation report was accepted by the concerned\ncourt. The sole purpose of the complainant Pramod Kumar in getting the\nsaid false FIR registered against accused Sandeep and Chawan (mediator\nof the marriage) was to pressurize and extort money from the accused\npersons."
