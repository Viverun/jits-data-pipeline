Borah,\nlearned counsel, appearing for the respondent.\n\n2. This appeal, under \nSection 19\n of the Family Courts Act, 1984, is presented against the\n Page No.# 2/18\n\njudgment and order dated 30.06.2018 passed by the Court of learned Principal Judge, Family\nCourt - I, Kamrup, Guwahati in F.C.(Civil) Case No. 390/2014. By the said judgment and\norder, the learned Family Court while allowing the petition of the respondent seeking\ndissolution of her marriage with the appellant by a decree of divorce on the allegation of\ncruelty, has dismissed the counter-claim filed by the appellant seeking the same relief of\ndissolution of his marriage with the respondent on the ground of cruelty. In the present\nappeal, the appellant has sought for setting aside of the impugned judgment and order of\nthe learned Family Court in so far as allowing the petition of the respondent seeking of\ndissolution of the marriage is concerned, and has further sought for allowing the counter-\nclaim preferred by the appellant before the learned Family Court by reversal of the order of\ndismissal.\n\n3. Before proceeding further as regards the rival contentions of the parties, it is\nnecessary to state the respective versions, in brief, projected by the contesting parties\nseeking, finally, the same relief of dissolution of their marriage.\n\n4. It is admitted by the parties that their marriage was solemnized on 11.03.2011 under\nthe \nSpecial Marriage Act, 1954\n before the Marriage Officer, Kamrup (M) at Guwahati. The\npetition was filed before the learned Family Court on 09.05.2014 by the respondent-wife\ninitially under the \nHindu Marriage Act, 1955\n. The petition was, later on, amended and the\nsame was preferred for dissolution of marriage under Section 27(1)(b) & \nSection 27(1)(d)\n of\nthe Special Marriage Act, 1954. The appellant had also prayed for dissolution of his marriage,\nby filing a counter-claim along with the written statement, by a decree of divorce under\n\nSection 27(1)(b)\n & \nSection 27(1)(d)\n of the Special Marriage Act, 1954.\n\n5. The respondent stated that after solemnization of the marriage on 14.03.2011, she\nalong with the appellant and his parents went to her matrimonial home at Bhopal where the\ncouple stayed till 28.03.2011. On 29.03.2011, the couple went to Delhi, the workplace of the\nappellant, to start their conjugal life. In Delhi, the appellant instead of taking the respondent\nto his rented house, stayed along with her in a hotel nearby the railway station. During that\n Page No.# 3/18\n\nperiod, the appellant citing financial hardship and his willingness to set up his own business,\npressurized the respondent with his demand for money and also seduced her to have sexual\nintercourse. The respondent was sent back to Guwahati to join her contractual job under a\nGovernment project where she joined before marriage, with the assurance to bring her back\nafter her resignation in June, 2011. But the appellant, contrary to his assurance, did not\ncome to Guwahati till August, 2011 on the pretext of official work, tour, etc. Thereafter, the\nappellant visited Guwahati as well as the respondent's parental house at Moranhat and\nduring that period too, the appellant pressurized the respondent to ask money from her\nparents. After their return to Guwahati from Moranhat, the appellant tortured her physically\nas well as sexually and did not take her along with him to Delhi. It was only in December,\n2011, the couple went to Delhi and started to live in the rented house of the appellant which,\naccording to the respondent, was improperly located and unhygienic. The respondent alleged\nto have brought the household items from Guwahati to Delhi at her own cost by carrier. But\nthe appellant resumed his demand of money for which he harassed her on her refusal. The\nappellant even during her illness did not take due care for which the parents of the\nrespondent had to visit Delhi to stay with her till her recovery. As the respondent got selected\nfor a contractual job under the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, she came\nback to Guwahati in February, 2012 to join in the new job. In June, 2012, the appellant came\nto Guwahati to stay with the respondent for a month and during that period, the appellant\nwho cohabited with her as a usual husband. The respondent had alleged that the appellant\nand his family prior to the marriage, deceitfully introduced the appellant as a software\nengineer, well settled in Delhi and believing so and assured of a happy married life, the\nrespondent entered into the marital relationship. Though the appellant's family treated her\nwell for a few days, they started mentally harassing her demanding dowry. Alleging that the\nappellant had no empathy towards their marital relationship and intentionally stayed away\nfrom her since September, 2012 by stopping communication with her and by not visiting her.\nThe respondent had alleged to be passing her days in extreme agony for a period of two\nyears at the time of institution of the petition seeking dissolution of her marriage, though the\nappellant instituted a petition, in the meantime, seeking restitution of conjugal rights only in\norder to escape from arrest in a case, G.R. Case No. 6786/2013, which the respondent\nlodged under \nSections 376\n/\n406\n/\n419\n/\n496\n/\n498A\n, Indian Penal Code (\nI.P.C\n.).\n\n Page No.# 4/18\n\n6. While admitting factum of marriage, the appellant by denying the contentions of the\nrespondent-wife in his written statement, had also lodged a counter-claim with it. The case\nprojected by the appellant in the counter-claim, in brief, is that his family is settled in the\ndistrict of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, though they originally hail from Assam. He has been\nworking as a Software Engineer in a company at Noida, U.P. since the year 2010. He further\nstated that the respondent is a Master Degree holder in Biotechnology and was working as a\nDistrict Project Officer under National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme at\nGuwahati. After the marriage, he along with the respondent and his parents came to Bhopal\nfrom Guwahati on 14.03.2011 for the marriage reception ceremony scheduled at Bhopal on\n27.03.2011. The conjugal life between them was started at Bhopal on 16.03.2011. But on\n17.03.2011, he had to leave for Delhi for official duty and returned back to Bhopal on\n23.03.2011. After the reception held on 27.03.2011, both of them reached Delhi on\n29.03.2011. As the respondent-wife was supposed to leave for Guwahati on 31.03.2011 after\nstaying at Delhi only for two nights, in order to continue her job after marriage till June,\n2011, the appellant arranged for her stay in a hotel for her convenience in order to catch the\nflight, instead of taking her to his rented accommodation in Faridabad. Thereafter, though\nboth of them joined their respective jobs, they were in touch with each other over phone,\nmail, etc. On 14.08.2011, the appellant after taking leave from his company job, reached\nGuwahati and stayed with the respondent in her flat at Guwahati. Thereafter, on 16.08.2011,\nboth of them went to the respondent's paternal home at Moran but on 21.08.2011, he had to\ngo back to Delhi on receiving call from the company and thereafter, had to go to Cochin for\nSoftware Installation job. The appellant admitted that during that time, there was good\ncordial relation between them. That his job required visits to various sites as per the\ndirections of the company, was explained to the respondent-wife prior to the marriage. The\nrespondent also, at no point of time, had stated that she would resign from her job and join\nhim in Delhi. Denying the allegation of demand of dowry and torture of the respondent on\nher refusal as false, it was stated that the respondent landed in Delhi on 15.12.2011 to\nrestart their conjugal life. From 02.01.2012, the respondent started having back pain, fever\nand stomach pain for which the appellant took all care including medical examination which\nshowed that she suffered from Jaundice. As the respondent's father is a Doctor, she used to\ntake only those medicines, which were prescribed by her father. On 09.01.2012, the\n Page No.# 5/18\n\nrespondent's parents arrived in Delhi. As she got an interview call, the respondent came back\nto Guwahati on 14.01.2012 for the interview, without taking any kind of permission from the\nappellant as he was never in support of the respondent joining another job at Guwahati while\nshe was adamant to join such a job. Though she joined in her new job in October, 2012, the\nrespondent stayed in Guwahati alone during that intervening period, despite numerous\nrequests from him to join him in Delhi. The appellant came to Guwahati in June, 2012 and\nstayed till 25.06.2012 during which period, the respondent asked him to settle in Assam.\nFollowing her request, he had even applied for new jobs at two places in Assam. As interview\nwas due in September, 2012, the appellant went back to Delhi to join his job and on\n01.09.2012, he came back to Guwahati to appear in the written test and the interview for the\njobs which he did not ultimately get. Referring to the calls, as alleged by the respondent, he\nstated that those were calls from his company clients only. As about the condition of the\nrented house at Faridabad which the respondent termed as unhygienic, he stated that he\ntook the same as per his financial capacity. The household items alleged to be brought by the\nrespondent, were already taken by her in February, 2012, he averred. Since the beginning of\nthe marriage life, the respondent did whatever she liked and on several occasions, she\nabused the appellant in filthy language despite no fault on his part. The appellant stated to\nhave tolerated such tortures inflicted upon him by the respondent as he never thought of\ndissolving the marriage. In December, 2012, the respondent suddenly called him and without\nciting any reason, abruptly asked him for mutual divorce but the appellant did not respond to\nthe said proposal. After joining in her new job in October, 2012, the respondent started\nbehaving in a completely different manner and stopped picking up his phone calls. Faced\nwith such situation, the appellant stated to have come to Guwahati along with his parents in\nApril, 2013 in order to meet the respondent for resolving the differences between them, if\nany, amicably but the respondent not only refused to meet them but also did not receive his\nphone calls. Thus, without meeting the respondent, all of them had to leave Guwahati. It\nwas since September, 2012, the respondent-wife had kept herself away from the appellant\nand she had neither contacted him nor visited her matrimonial home since then, which had\ncaused immense mental and physical trauma to the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant, to\nhis surprise, learnt in August, 2013 that the respondent had filed a complaint being\nComplaint Case No. 6786/2013, making concocted allegations, against him and his old and\n Page No.# 6/18\n\ninnocent parents alleging criminal breach of trust, cheating by personation, commission of\nrape and subjecting her to cruelty, which got registered as a police case under \nSections\n376\n/\n406\n/\n419\n/\n496\n/\n498A\n, I.P.C. The appellant and his parents had to approach the High Court\nand they were granted pre-arrest bail by the High Court. Forgetting all these misdeeds of the\nrespondent, the appellant stated to have sent an e-mail on 13.08.2013 urging her to solve all\nher stated problems in an amicable manner but the same was not responded to. Though he\nfiled a petition for restitution of the conjugal rights, he having realized that the lives of his old\nand ailing parents apart from his own, would be in danger at the hands of the appellant as\nshe had resorted to false case, he had withdrawn the said petition on 21.06.2014 and\npreferred the counter-claim seeking dissolution of his marriage by a decree of divorce on the\nground of the respondent's wilful desertion and inhumane torture inflicted on him.\n\n7. Ms. Deka assailing the findings of the learned Family Court, has submitted that no\ncase of cruelty, either mental or physical, and desertion can be made out from the evidence\nled by the respondent-wife and in such view of the matter, the learned Family Court could not\nhave rendered such a finding. Rather, it is the appellant who has led sufficient evidence in\nsupport of his contentions regarding cruelty and desertion and, as such, the counter-claim\nfiled by the appellant ought to have been allowed. The respondent had instituted a case\nunder \nSections 376\n/\n406\n/\n419\n/\n496\n/\n498A\n, I.P.C. not only against the appellant but also his\nparents falsely who did not interfere in their matrimonial relationship at any point in any\nmanner whatsoever. \nIn support of her submission, she has placed reliance in the decision in\n\nArnesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar\n, reported in (2014) 8 SCC 273.\n\n8. Per contra, Ms. Bora supporting the decision of learned Family Court, has submitted\nthat the learned Court had rightly allowed the petition of the respondent on the ground of\ncruelty and dismissed the counter-claim of the appellant. As the learned Family Court has\nrendered the judgment after rightly appreciating the rival contentions, there is no reason to\ndisturb the said findings in appeal. She has further placed reliance in the decision of\n\nVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate vs. Neela Vijakumar Bhate\n , reported in (2003) 6 SCC 334.\n\n Page No.# 7/18\n\n9. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and also\nconsidered the materials available in the records of F.C.(Civil) No. 390/2014, in original, as\nthe learned counsel for the parties have referred to the respective evidence led by the\ncontesting parties.\n\n10. Upon the rival pleadings of the parties, the learned Family Court had framed three\nissues each in respect of the petition of the respondent-wife as well as in respect of the\ncounter-claim of the appellant-husband. One of the issues in respect of the petition of the\nrespondent-wife was that as to whether the appellant had treated the respondent with\ncruelty. In respect of the counter-claim, the learned Family Court had framed issues, firstly,\nwhether the respondent had treated the appellant with cruelty ? and, secondly, whether the\nrespondent had deserted the appellant ?\n\n11. In support of her petition, the respondent examined herself as P.W.1. Though the\nfather of the respondent submitted his evidence on affidavit as P.W.2, the said evidence\nstood expunged by the learned Family Court as he did not appear for cross-examination. On\nthe other hand, the appellant examined himself as D.W.1 and also adduced the evidence of\none Smti. Nilima Borah as D.W.2, who were cross-examined by the respondent.\n\n12. Both the parties had admitted that their marriage was solemnized on 11.03.2011\nunder the \nSpecial Marriage Act, 1954\n before the Marriage Officer, Kamrup (M), Guwahati. It\nhas further emerged from the evidence of the parties that since September, 2012, they have\nbeen living separately from each other at different places. What has further emerged is that\nduring the period between 11.03.2011 and September, 2012, the spouses had lived together\na few times, on each occasion for a short period of time, which periods were interspersed.\nAfter the marriage on 11.03.2011, at Guwahati, both of them along with the appellant's\nparents went to Bhopal on 14.03.2011 as the appellant's family resides in Bhopal, Madhya\nPradesh. As per the version of the appellant, the conjugal life between them was started on\n16.03.2011. But on 17.03.2011, he had to leave Bhopal for Delhi wherefrom he came back to\nBhopal on 23.03.2011. There was a marriage reception ceremony in Bhopal on 27.03.2011.\n\n Page No.# 8/18\n\nAfter the said reception ceremony, the couple left for Delhi and reached there on 29.03.2011.\nThere is no allegation of the respondent to the effect that during the said period of her brief\nstay in Bhopal, anybody from the appellant's family had treated her badly. In Delhi, the\ncouple stayed for two nights in a hotel, instead of staying at the rented accommodation of\nthe appellant located in Faridabad. An allegation was made by the respondent that instead of\ntaking her to his rented accommodation, the appellant had accommodated her in a hotel.\nShe had stated that she came back to Guwahati from Delhi by flight on 31.03.2011. It was\nnot explained by the respondent as to why such stay in the hotel had any correlation with\nthe allegation of cruelty. The version of the appellant was that as the respondent was\nsupposed to come back to Guwahati by catching a morning flight from Delhi on 31.03.2011,\nhe preferred to stay together in a hotel for those two nights for the convenience of the\nrespondent, instead of taking her to Faridabad which is far off from the Airport. When cross-\nexamined, the respondent stated that she was not aware that the appellant had taken her to\nthe hotel for her convenience. Thereafter, there was nothing on record to show that the\nspouses stayed together at one place until August, 2011.\n\n13. The appellant stated to have reached Guwahati on 14.08.2011 after getting leave from\nhis company and stayed with the respondent in her flat at Guwahati till 16.08.2011, on which\nday they both went to the respondent's paternal home at Moran. But on 21.08.2011, the\nappellant had to go back to Delhi and thereafter, went to Cochin for attending his official duty\nand it was stated by him that during that time, they had good cordial relationship. The\nrespondent had also stated that the appellant acted like a responsible husband during that\nperiod and admitted that after one week, he went to Delhi for his official works with the\nassurance that he would come back to Guwahati to take her to Delhi in December, 2011. It\nhas also emerged from the version of the respondent that she after coming back from Delhi\nin January, 2011, joined her contractual post at Guwahati. From February, 2011 to August,\n2011, the parties had not stayed together at one place. It was the testimony of the\nrespondent that during that time, the mother of the appellant used to tell her to shift to\nDelhi. The version of the appellant was that the respondent was supposed to continue in her\njob till June, 2011 to complete her one year job tenure and thereafter, to join him at Delhi.\n\n Page No.# 9/18\n\nFrom the aforesaid testimonies of the parties, it can be noticed that after 31.03.2011, they\nagain stayed together from 14.08.2011 to 21.08.2011 and during that period they had no\nallegation against each other.\n\n14. It was in December, 2011, the appellant came to Guwahati and after staying in\nGuwahati for one week, they both left for Delhi. It was the case of the respondent that she\ntook few household belongings like T.V., storewell, etc. which the appellant had not denied,\nalong with her in December, 2011 with a view to start a new life, as per the respondent, at\nDelhi and stayed at the rented house at Faridabad. The respondent stated to have fallen sick\n\nin the 1st week of January, 2012. While the respondent had alleged that the appellant did not\ntake due care of her by not taking her to a Doctor, the appellant had asserted that he had\ntaken all necessary care of the respondent and had also taken her to a Doctor who after due\nmedical examination, confirmed that she had suffered from Jaundice and prescribed\nmedicines for her. But the respondent, whose father is a Doctor, had taken medicines which\nwere prescribed by her father. The respondent had stated that it was at the request of her\nfather, the appellant had admitted her in a hospital and had done her medical checkup. It\nwas during that period, the parents of the respondent visited her in Delhi. As she got an\ninterview call from a Government Organisation in the meantime, she after recovery had come\nback to Guwahati to attend the interview with due permission of the appellant. The appellant\non the other hand, had stated that the respondent left Delhi for Guwahati in February, 2012\nand he also accompanied her to Assam. While the respondent stated that he was not in\nfavour of her joining in a new job, the respondent had stated that the appellant did not make\nany intervention, rather, he showed eagerness asking her to join the job. While the\nrespondent had stated that the appellant also expressed his willingness to settle himself in\nAssam, the appellant, on the contrary, stated that it was on the persuasion of the respondent\nhe tried to get a job in Guwahati for which he appeared in some interviews also. The\nrespondent had stated that the appellant came to Guwahati in June, 2012 in order to stay\nwith her for a month. It was alleged that he used to get missed calls from unknown numbers\nand he hesitated to receive those calls and tried to conceal things and she found his such\nbehaviour unsound. On the other hand, the appellant had sought to explain that those calls\n Page No.# 10/18\n\nwere calls from his company and customers and he did not want to receive those calls in\norder to avoid causing disturbance to her. He further stated that being in a company job, he\nhad to keep the mobile phone switched on at all the times. The respondent had admitted\nthat the appellant had made efforts to secure a job in Assam and having failed to secure a\njob in Assam, he left for Delhi to continue his job. Subsequent to that, none of the parties\nhad stated they had stayed together at one place and both of them had admitted that they\nhave been living separately since September, 2012. On a combined reading of the\ntestimonies of the appellant and the respondent together, it clearly transpires that they lived\ntogether at one place on three occasions, that too, for a short period on each occasion. It is\non the aforesaid premises, the allegations and counter-allegations of the respective parties\nare to be considered.\n\n15. From the materials on record, it does not emerge that except for the period\nimmediately after the marriage i.e. from 14.03.2011 to 29.03.2011, the respondent-wife had\nstayed with the parents of the appellant in Bhopal and it does not emerge from her\ntestimony that anything untoward had happened during that brief period of stay. She had,\nhowever, alleged vaguely in her petition that there was some demand of dowry from her\nmother-in-law but there was no specific allegation. There was absolutely no whisper as\nregards any allegation of demand of dowry from the father of the appellant. Though an\nallegation was made that there was deception on the part of the parents of the appellant\nwho projected the appellant as a well settled Software Engineer, the respondent did not lead\nany evidence to substantiate the said allegation. She alleged that on enquiry, she found the\nappellant as fake and he married her by giving false identity and fraudulent information and\nhis intention was to extract money from her as dowry. Such allegation which she had made\nwhen she filed her evidence on affidavit initially on 22.06.2015, had been changed by herself,\nlater on, materially by submitting additional evidence on affidavit on 11.01.2016 where she\nhad stated that the appellant is a Software Engineer at R.M.S. Software Pvt. Ltd, Noida, Uttar\nPradesh since 2010 and he used to earn not less than Rs. 1,50,000/- per month as salary.\nThe respondent in her petition, also demanded an amount of Rs. 50,00,000/- as permanent\nalimony from the appellant. The stand of the respondent on that count is found to be\n Page No.# 11/18\n\nvacillating. While admitting that he has been working as a Software Engineer at R.M.S.\nSoftware Pvt. Ltd., the appellant had stated that his monthly salary was not Rs. 1,50,000/-\nbut Rs. 35,000/- for which he exhibited his pay slips (Ext.-C, Ext.-D and Ext.-E) as well as a\nbank statement (Ext.-F).\n\n16. It is noticed that the respondent had instituted a case, initially as a complaint case,\nbefore the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (M), Guwahati which, later on,\nwas forwarded to the Geetanagar Police Station for enquiry and report. As the complaint was\nmade by the respondent against the appellant and his parents, who stayed in Bhopal,\nMadhya Pradesh for commission of offences under \nSections 376\n/\n406\n/\n419\n/\n496\n/\n498A\n, I.P.C., a\ncase was registered by police being Geetanagar Police Station Case No. 146/2013 under\nthose Sections of law. The appellant and his parents were granted pre-arrest bail in\nconnection with Geetanagar Police Station Case No. 146/2013 and the police after\ninvestigation, had submitted charge sheet only against the appellant under \nSection 498A\n,\nI.P.C. which is indicative of the facts that no prima facie case was found by the police to lay a\ncharge sheet against the parents of the appellant for any of the offences mentioned above,\nand against the appellant under \nSections 376\n/\n406\n/\n419\n/\n496\n, I.P.C. As has been admitted by\nboth the parties, they have been living separately from each other since September, 2012 at\ntwo different places but the respondent had chosen to institute a case under \nSections\n376\n/\n406\n/\n419\n/\n496\n/\n498A\n, I.P.C. in the year 2013. Neither party had exhibited the F.I.R. or the\ncharge sheet filed in connection with Geetanagar Police Station Case No. 146/2013 (G.R.\nCase No. 6786/2013) and, as such, there is no occasion for us to know any details about the\nsame. There is also no explanation on the part of the respondent as to why she had leveled\nsuch allegations, that too, after a period of delay. There is no testimony of the respondent to\nthe effect that there was any forceful sexual act on the part of the appellant against her\nduring the periods they were together. It is submitted by Ms. Deka, by referring to the\nadditional affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant, that the G.R. Case No. 6786/2013 had\nended in acquittal of the appellant by virtue of a judgment and order dated 03.12.2018\npassed by the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Kamrup (M), Guwahati.\n\n Page No.# 12/18\n\n17. The term 'cruelty' is not defined in the \nSpecial Marriage Act, 1955\n. Cruelty can either\nbe physical cruelty or mental cruelty. As there is no allegation of physical cruelty in the case\nin hand, no dilation is required in that respect. Mental cruelty is the conduct and treatment of\none spouse against the other which causes mental suffering, trauma or fear to the\nmatrimonial life and such conduct and treatment has to be of such magnitude as to cause a\nreasonable apprehension in the mind of the other spouse that it would be harmful and\ninjurious for the petitioner to live any longer with the other party. It has to be borne in mind\nthat cruelty is distinguishable from the ordinary wear and tear of family life. It is a matter to\nbe considered and determined in each case having regard to the facts and circumstances of\nthat particular case.\n\n18. \nIn \nVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate\n (supra), the question that has arisen is as to\nwhether the averments, accusations and character assassination of the wife by the appellant-\nhusband in the written statement constitute mental cruelty for sustaining the claim for\ndivorce under \nSection 13(1)(ia)\n of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a provision pari materia to\nthe provision of \nSection 27(1)(d)\n of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. It is held to be well\nsettled that leveling disgusting accusations of unchastity and indecent familiarity with a\nperson outside wedlock and allegations of extra-marital relationship is a grave assault on the\ncharacter, honour, reputation, status as well as the health of the wife. Such aspersions\nattributed to the wife viewed in the context of an educated Indian wife and judged by Indian\nconditions and standards would amount to worst form of insult and cruelty, sufficient by itself\nto substantiate cruelty in law, warranting the claim of the wife being allowed. In the case in\nhand, the appellant in the written statement had stated that the respondent used to share\nissues relating to her married life with friends, specially males. It was stated that the\nrespondent had the habit of roaming around with her boyfriends prior to her marriage and\nshe did not abandon the said habit after the marriage and concocted the story about\ninfliction of cruelty by him in order to get a decree of divorce. During the cross-examination,\nhe stated that the respondent wanted to go out with boys. From a perusal of it, it does not\nappear that the appellant had made any character assassination of the wife by scurrilous\naccusations of unchastity or extra marital relationship assaulting the character, honour,\n Page No.# 13/18\n\nreputation, etc. of the wife so as to entitle the wife to claim dissolution of marriage on the\nground of cruelty in law.\n \nThe ratio exposited in the decision in \nVijaykumar Ramchandra Bhate\n\n(supra) is found to be inapplicable to the fact situation obtaining in the present case.\n\n19. From the case presented by the respondent, as has been discussed above, it does not\ninspire any confidence that the case falls in the category wherefrom a conclusion can be\narrived at that because of the conduct and treatment of the appellant the respondent had\nundergone such mental suffering, trauma or fear in her matrimonial life which has the effect\nto cause an apprehension, much less reasonable apprehension, in her mind that it would be\nharmful and injurious for her to continue the matrimonial relationship any longer with the\nappellant. The allegations made by the respondent in relation to the incidents enumerated in\nthe case on hand, without corroboration of any kind, cannot be termed as cruelty so as to\nentitle her to the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce under \nSection 27\n of the\nSpecial Marriage Act, 1954. Having regard to the materials on record, we are of the\nconsidered opinion that the learned Family Court was not justified in its approach to come to\na conclusion that the respondent was compelled to file the case against the appellant and his\nfamily members finding no alternative when the demands of the appellant crossed all limits\nand she was subjected to continuous physical and mental torture. In such view of the matter,\nthe present appeal in so far as against the petition filed by the respondent-wife is concerned,\nsucceeds and resultantly, the decision of the learned Family Court of granting the decree of\ndivorce, in our considered opinion, in favour of the respondent-wife, deserves to be reversed.\nAccordingly, the appeal against that part of the judgment and order dated 30.06.2018 is\nallowed by setting aside and quashing the dissolution of the marriage by a decree of divorce.\n\n20. One of the pleas that was raised for grant of divorce by the appellant in the counter-\nclaim was under \nSection 27(1)(b)\n of the Special Marriage Act. It provides for grant of divorce\non the ground of desertion for a continuous period of not less than 2 (two) years\nimmediately preceding the presentation of the petition. As per prescription of \nSection 27(1)\n\n(b) of the \nSpecial Marriage Act\n, a wife or a husband can seek dissolution of marriage by\ndecree of divorce if the other party has deserted the spouse seeking the divorce for a\n Page No.# 14/18\n\ncontinuous period of not less than 2 (two) years immediately preceding the presentation of\nthe petition. Desertion, in the context of a case seeking dissolution of marriage, has been\ninterpreted, in essence, as intentional permanent forsaking and abandonment of one spouse\nby the other without that other's consent and reasonable cause. Desertion does not mean\nsimple withdrawal by one spouse from the company of the other spouse.\n\n21. The learned Family Court had observed that the appellant stated that since the month\nof September, 2012, the respondent kept herself away from the appellant and stopped\nreceiving his phone calls. It further arrived at a finding that the appellant since June, 2012\nbehaved indifferently towards the respondent by harassing her with demand of dowry and\nbecoming violent at the non-fulfillment of his demands, about which a discussion has already\nbeen made above, and having observed so, the learned Family Court had further held that\nthe allegation of desertion brought by the appellant in the counter-claim was not proved.\n\n22. Notwithstanding the above finding of the learned Family Court as regards desertion,\nthe records of F.C.(Civil) Case No. 390/2014 shows that the petition was filed by the\nrespondent-wife seeking dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce on 09.05.2014.\nResponding to the same, the appellant had filed his written statement along with the\ncounter-claim on 21.06.2014. It is an admitted version of both the appellant and the\nrespondent that they have been living separately since September, 2012. Thus, at the time of\npresentation of the counter-claim by the appellant-husband, the condition of 2 (two) years\ncontinuous period was not satisfied and as such, the ground of desertion, taken by the\nappellant, has to be held as untenable in the present case.\n\n23. The appellant in his evidence as D.W.1 had reiterated the same facts as in the written\nstatement and counter-claim. He further alleged that the respondent had the habit of\nroaming around with her boyfriends prior to her marriage and she did not abandon her said\nhabit even after her marriage and she had, in order to get the decree of divorce with\nalimony, made allegations against him which were concocted and also instituted the criminal\ncase. In order to substantiate his said allegation, he exhibited few photographs as exhibits\n Page No.# 15/18\n\nunder objection from the respondent. He asserted that he used to give money to the\nrespondent occasionally and also used to pay her mobile bills, cable connection bills, etc. By\nexhibiting a number of mobile bills, he had stated about the number of calls he used to give\nto 3 mobile numbers of the respondent. He further stated that respondent used to stay in a\n3-bedroom flat given to her by her father at Guwahati and used to have the services of a car\ndriver. In his cross-examination, he admitted about sending the respondent to Guwahati to\ncontinue her job. He stated that he came to Guwahati for settlement but despite numerous\nphone calls, the respondent did not pick up the phone. He stated to have told the facts to\nD.W.2 when he and his parents visited her on 14.03.2013 at Jorhat. D.W.2, a retired\nprofessor, is a resident of Jorhat. The appellant is the son of her husband's younger brother\nand the respondent is the daughter of her cousin brother. Because of such relation, the\nappellant was known to her since his birth. The marriage between the appellant and the\nrespondent was arranged through her. After their marriage on 11.03.2011, the couple visited\nher house in Jorhat in June, 2012 and at that time, both looked happy. The appellant's father\nis a heart patient and as he had undergone a heart operation in 2010, the appellant's mother\nhad to stay with him always as there was nobody to look after since their only daughter is\nsettled happily in Norway with her family. She stated that once in April, 2013, the appellant\nand his parents visited her house at Jorhat and they told D.W.2 as to how they had suffered\nat the hands of the respondent. It was told to her by the appellant that the respondent did\nnot want to stay with the appellant and refused to go to Delhi to stay with him, by preferring\nto stay in Guwahati alone in her flat. On being made aware about the events in the aforesaid\nmanner, D.W.2 stated to have talked to the respondent's father with the proposal as to\nwhether the elders of both the sides should talk to the spouses in order to sort out their\ndifferences. Without giving any reply to the said proposal, the respondent's father blamed\nher for arranging the marriage of his daughter with the appellant before switching off the\nphone. D.W.2 had, however, admitted that she never met the respondent intimately since she\nhad grown up but proposed the marriage as both the families were known to her. She further\nstated that in July, 2013, she was informed by the appellant's mother over phone about filing\nof the criminal case against the appellant and his parents.\n\n Page No.# 16/18\n\n24. Thus from the evidence of D.W.2, it is evident that after the marriage on 11.03.2011,\nshe met the couple only on one occasion in June, 2012 when the couple visited her house at\nJorhat and she found, at that time, both of them happy. D.W.2 does not have first hand\nknowledge about the married life of the spouses for the period subsequent to June, 2012. It\nwas in the month of July, 2013 only D.W.2 was informed about institution of the case against\nthe appellant and his family. The said witness was told about the alleged torture by the\nappellant and his parents only in April, 2013 when they visited her house at Jorhat. But it\nwas from September, 2012 i.e. much prior to April, 2013, the appellant and the respondent\nhave been staying separately with they both continuing their jobs at Delhi and Guwahati\nrespectively. The prayer for dissolution of the marriage, in the petition as well as in the\ncounter-claim, was made for the events that had occurred between 11.03.2011 and\nSeptember, 2012. Thus, the testimony of D.W.2 in view of her admission about the source of\nher knowledge, does not carry much value in so far as regards the marital relationship\nbetween the appellant and the respondent is concerned and it cannot be said that her\ndeposition has lent any corroboration to the contention of the appellant with regard to his\nplea for divorce on the ground of cruelty.\n\n25. The decision in \nArnesh Kumar\n (supra), was rendered in a criminal appeal where the\npetitioner apprehended his arrest in a case under \nSection 498A\n, I.P.C. and \nSection 4\n of the\nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961. After discussing the rate of charge sheeting in cases under\n\nSection 498A\n, I.P.C. and the rate of conviction in such cases after trial, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in order to ensure that police officers do not arrest the accused unnecessarily and\nMagistrates do not authorize detention casually and mechanically, has given certain directions\nto all the State Governments to instruct its police officers not to automatically arrest when a\ncase under \nSection 498A\n, I.P.C. is registered but to satisfy themselves about the necessity for\narrest under the parameters laid down therein flowing from \nSection 41\n, Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973. We do not find any relevance of \nthe said decision\n with the merits of the\ninstant appeal arising out of a judgment and order of the learned Family Court in a petition\nand a counter-claim seeking divorce.\n\n Page No.# 17/18\n\n26. As has been noticed above, the contesting parties had stayed together at one place\nonly on three occasions, on each occasion for a brief period, interspersed between\n11.03.2011 and September, 2012 to discharge their marital obligations to each other. The\nevents which had occurred between them have already been discussed above wherefrom it is\nfound that allegations and counter-allegations were made by each respective spouse without\nany corroboration from any other quarter. The testimony of the appellant, in the context of\nthe aforesaid discussion, does not also inspire us to come to a conclusion that he had been\nable to make out a case of infliction of mental cruelty on him by the respondent so as to\nentitle him for the dissolution of his marriage by decree of divorce. The allegations and\ncounter-allegations leveled by one against the other, even assumed to be true, appear to\nhave arisen out of the types of life the parties are accustomed to in relation to their social\nand economic conditions as well as their perception to culture and human values. The\nconduct and behaviour of one spouse vis-à-vis the other spouse in the case in hand appear\nto have caused unhappiness, dissatisfaction and emotional upset but the same cannot be a\nground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. Such irritations and oppositions\nof one spouse about the conduct and behaviour of the other spouse could not be adequate\nfor grant of divorce under \nSection 27(1)(d)\n of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Though the\nparties have stated that they have been living separately since September, 2012, such\nseparate living per se does not enable the Court to grant a decree of divorce when it does\nnot fall under any of the statutory prescriptions of \nSection 27\n of the Special Marriage Act,\n1954. Thus, we hold that the appeal to that part of the judgment and order dated\n30.06.2018, whereby the learned Family Court had dismissed the counter-claim of the\nappellant, fails and accordingly, the appeal to that part of the judgment and order is rejected.\n\n27. With the aforesaid observations, the present appeal stands disposed of.\n\n28. The LCR is to be sent back accordingly.\n\n JUDGE CHIEF JUSTICE (ACTING)\n Page No.# 18/18\n\nComparing Assistant",

The case\nprojected by the appellant in the counter-claim, in brief, is that his family is settled in the\ndistrict of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, though they originally hail from Assam. He has been\nworking as a Software Engineer in a company at Noida, U.P. since the year 2010. He further\nstated that the respondent is a Master Degree holder in Biotechnology and was working as a\nDistrict Project Officer under National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme at\nGuwahati. After the marriage, he along with the respondent and his parents came to Bhopal\nfrom Guwahati on 14.03.2011 for the marriage reception ceremony scheduled at Bhopal on\n27.03.2011. The conjugal life between them was started at Bhopal on 16.03.2011. But on\n17.03.2011, he had to leave for Delhi for official duty and returned back to Bhopal on\n23.03.2011. After the reception held on 27.03.2011, both of them reached Delhi on\n29.03.2011. As the respondent-wife was supposed to leave for Guwahati on 31.03.2011 after\nstaying at Delhi only for two nights, in order to continue her job after marriage till June,\n2011, the appellant arranged for her stay in a hotel for her convenience in order to catch the\nflight, instead of taking her to his rented accommodation in Faridabad. Thereafter, though\nboth of them joined their respective jobs, they were in touch with each other over phone,\nmail, etc. On 14.08.2011, the appellant after taking leave from his company job, reached\nGuwahati and stayed with the respondent in her flat at Guwahati.

Though she joined in her new job in October, 2012, the\nrespondent stayed in Guwahati alone during that intervening period, despite numerous\nrequests from him to join him in Delhi. The appellant came to Guwahati in June, 2012 and\nstayed till 25.06.2012 during which period, the respondent asked him to settle in Assam.\nFollowing her request, he had even applied for new jobs at two places in Assam. As interview\nwas due in September, 2012, the appellant went back to Delhi to join his job and on\n01.09.2012, he came back to Guwahati to appear in the written test and the interview for the\njobs which he did not ultimately get.

As has been noticed above, the contesting parties had stayed together at one place\nonly on three occasions, on each occasion for a brief period, interspersed between\n11.03.2011 and September, 2012 to discharge their marital obligations to each other. The\nevents which had occurred between them have already been discussed above wherefrom it is\nfound that allegations and counter-allegations were made by each respective spouse without\nany corroboration from any other quarter. The testimony of the appellant, in the context of\nthe aforesaid discussion, does not also inspire us to come to a conclusion that he had been\nable to make out a case of infliction of mental cruelty on him by the respondent so as to\nentitle him for the dissolution of his marriage by decree of divorce. The allegations and\ncounter-allegations leveled by one against the other, even assumed to be true, appear to\nhave arisen out of the types of life the parties are accustomed to in relation to their social\nand economic conditions as well as their perception to culture and human values. The\nconduct and behaviour of one spouse vis-à-vis the other spouse in the case in hand appear\nto have caused unhappiness, dissatisfaction and emotional upset but the same cannot be a\nground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. Such irritations and oppositions\nof one spouse about the conduct and behaviour of the other spouse could not be adequate\nfor grant of divorce under \nSection 27(1)(d)\n of the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Though the\nparties have stated that they have been living separately since September, 2012, such\nseparate living per se does not enable the Court to grant a decree of divorce when it does\nnot fall under any of the statutory prescriptions of \nSection 27\n of the Special Marriage Act,\n1954. Thus, we hold that the appeal to that part of the judgment and order dated\n30.06.2018, whereby the learned Family Court had dismissed the counter-claim of the\nappellant, fails and accordingly, the appeal to that part of the judgment and order is rejected."
