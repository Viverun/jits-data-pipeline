JUSTICE SANDEEP N. BHATT\n\nDate : 20/03/2024\n\nORDER CAV JUDGMENT\n\n1. These Appeals From Orders are preferred under\n\nOrder 43 Rule 1(r)\nof the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908\n\n(`\nCPC\n' for short). Appeal From Order no.12 of 2023 is filed\n\nby the original defendant nos.2 to 4 being aggrieved by the\n\norder dated 12.1.2023 passed below Exh.5 in SCS No.16 of\n\n2022 (Old RCS No.98 of 2020) by the learned Principal\n\nSenior Civil Judge, Valsad, whereby the applicant Exh.5\n\npreferred by the original plaintiffs seeking injunction against\n\nthe defendants came to be allowed. Being aggrieved by the\n\nvery same order, defendant no.5 has filed the Appeal From\n\nOrder No.13 of 2023.\n\n2. As both these appeals are arising out of the same\n\norder, the facts are same and the arguments advanced are\n\nalso same, they were ordered to be tagged together by a\n\nprevious order dated 1.2.2023. Accordingly, they are heard\n\ntogether and disposed of by this common judgment.

The brief facts leading to filing of these appeals,\n\nas stated in the memo of appeals are such that the\n\nopponents-original plaintiffs filed Special Civil Suit No.16 of\n\n2022 (Old RCS No.98 of 2020) for partition, declaration,\n\npermanent injunction and also for accounts against the\n\ndefendant nos.1 to 4 (who are the brothers of the plaintiffs)\n\nand against the defendant no.5 who is subsequent purchaser;\n\nthat on 10.5.2019 and 22.1.2020, the appellants herein\n\nentered into an agreement to sale for the suit property with\n\ndefendant no.5, originally the said property was an\n\nagricultural land which was subsequently converted into non-\n\nagriculture land and at present, the defendant no.5 is putting\n\nup the construction over the said property. It is averred that\n\nalong with the said suit, application Exh.5 was also preferred\n\nby the plaintiffs to which the defendants opposed and after\n\nhearing the said application, the learned trial Court has\n\nallowed the said application at Exh.5 vide order dated\n\n12.1.2023. The defendant nos.1 to 4 and defendant no.5 gave\n\napplications at Exh.78 and 79 respectively, praying to stay\n\nthe said order to approach the higher forum, which was\n\nallowed and the order passed below Exh.5 was stayed for 20\n\ndays.\n\nPage 3 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nThese appeals from order were filed and when listed, notice\n\nwas issued and the said order of staying the impugned order\n\npassed below Exh.5 application is continued from time to\n\ntime by various orders passed by this Court.\n\n4. Heard learned advocates for the parties.\n\n4.1 Learned senior advocate Mr.Mihir Thakore with\n\nlearned senior advocate Ms.Trusha Patel with learned\n\nadvocate Mr.Nisarg Raval for the appellants of Appeal From\n\nOrder no.13 of 2023 has submitted that the dispute is with\n\nregard to the land bearing Survey No.130/2 (Block No.523)\n\nadmeasuring 11,176 sq.mtrs of village Atakpardi, Taluka and\n\nDistrict Valsad (hereinafter referred to the `the disputed land'\n\nfor the sake of brevity); that the plaintiffs are sisters of\n\ndefendants nos.1-4; that the impugned suit is filed by the\n\nplaintiffs contending that the disputed land along with other\n\nproperties mentioned in paragraph 1 of the plaint were\n\nancestral properties and they have share in the same; that a\n\nnotarized undertaking dated 23.4.2018 was executed by\n\nplaintiffs and it was agreed that the defendants nos.1 to 4\n\nwould give some amount to the sisters and upon receipt of\n\nthe same, the sisters would relinquish their rights qua the\n\ndisputed land; however, no such amount is received by them\n\nPage 4 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nand therefore the registered relinquishment deed dated\n\n7.5.2018 executed by them was under undue influence; that\n\nthe Mutation entry which was posted pursuant to the\n\nrelinquishment deed was also posted and certified without\n\nfollowing due process of law and therefore the registered\n\nagreements to sell dated 10.5.2019 and 22.1.2020 executed by\n\nthe defendants no.1 to 4 are also illegal and not binding to\n\nthem. He submitted that with the said pleadings, the\n\nplaintiffs had filed the said suit.\n\n4.2 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore submitted that\n\nas the plaintiffs doubted the genuineness of agreement to\n\nsale on the ground that the defendants had shown very high\n\nsell price, the defendant no.5 had shown readiness and\n\nwillingness to deposit the market price of alleged share of\n\nthe plaintiffs at Jantri price before the Court; that the\n\ndefendant nos.1 to 4 had handed over the possession to\n\ndefendant no.5 and the said defendant had floated a project\n\nin it. He submitted that from the recording obtained from\n\nthe office of sub-registrar, it clearly establishes that the\n\nplaintiffs had voluntarily, with full understanding, in presence\n\nof their husband executed relinquishment deed before the\n\nsub-registrar. Referring to this, learned senior advocate\n\nMr.Thakore submitted that\nSection 50\nof the Registration Act\n\nsays that registered document prevails over unregistered\n\nPage 5 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ndocument and\nArticle 49\nSchedule 1 of the Gujarat Stamp\n\nAct specifies that stamp of only Rs.100 is required to be\n\naffixed while registration. The sub-registrar's endorsement is a\n\nproof of facts stated in the deed.\n\n4.3 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore submits that\n\nthe plaintiffs claim to be in possession of the disputed\n\nproperty but they did not give any application to draw\n\npanchanama and when the defendant no.5 gave such\n\napplication, the same was objected by the plaintiffs. The\n\npanchanama shows that the construction is carried out by\n\ndefendant no.5. He submitted that the possession is handed\n\nover by the defendant nos.1 to 4 to defendant no.5, which is\n\nnot disputed and there is no reason for the learned trial\n\nCourt to disbelieve handing over the possession only on the\n\nground that the Agreement to sell does not reflect so. He\n\nsubmitted that there is no prohibition to hand over the\n\npossession after execution of agreement to sell, if the parties\n\nso wished to and even the quantum of compensation paid\n\nhas also no relevance when it comes to handing over the\n\npossession, particularly, when the defendant nos.1 to 4 did\n\nnot so dispute.\n\n4.4 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore submitted\n\nwith regard to the Mutation Entry that the notices under\n\nPage 6 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nSection 135D of the Bombay Land Revenue Code were issued,\n\nserved, acknowledgment receipts were duly signed and then\n\nonly the entry was certified, which entry is not challenged by\n\nthe plaintiffs before the revenue authorities and hence, the\n\npoint raised in the suit regarding this could not have been\n\nconsidered by the learned trial Court while granting the\n\nimpugned application at Exh.5.\n\n4.5 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore has further\n\nsubmitted that equity is created in favour of the defendant\n\nno.5, that too, after one year of execution of registered\n\nrelinquishment deed and the appellant has put up huge\n\nconstruction and has spent huge amount.\n\n4.6 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore has submitted\n\nthat the defendant no.5 is a bonafide purchaser who has paid\n\nhuge amount pursuant to the agreement to sale and also\n\nwhen the registered relinquishment deed is executed by the\n\nobjectors- original plaintiffs, such filing of the said suit is\n\nnothing but an arm twisting technique. He has further\n\nsubmitted that the said agreement to sale is executed in\n\nfavour of the present appellant. The Deed of Relinquishment\n\nis also executed by the plaintiffs whereby at the time of\n\nregistration, the plaintiffs have admitted before the sub-\n\nregistrar that the consideration is received by them and\n\nPage 7 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ntherefore the present suit proceeding is filed with a view to\n\nharass the defendant no.5, that too after a long delay of 1 ½\n\nyears after arising of such alleged cause of action, for\n\nsnatching more money. He submitted that the registered deed\n\nof relinquishment is executed on 10.5.2019 and the suit for\n\nits cancellation is filed after 17 months and the learned trial\n\nCourt ought to have considered that even if the suit is filed\n\nwithin limitation, the injunction is not to be granted if there\n\nis delay in approaching the Court.\n\n4.7 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore has drawn my\n\nattention towards the NA permission and the agreement to\n\nsale which is executed in favour of the defendant no.5 and\n\nsubmitted that at no point of time, the plaintiffs have raised\n\nany objection. Not only that even the entries in revenue\n\nrecord is also effected and the notices under Section 135D\n\nwere also served on the plaintiffs and at that point of time\n\nalso, they have not raised any objection and therefore the\n\nplaintiffs cannot be permitted to take undue advantage of the\n\nsituation. He, therefore, submitted that the factor of prima\n\nfacie case and balance of convenience is also in the favour of\n\nthe defendant no.5 and not the plaintiffs.\n\n4.8 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore has submitted\n\nthat considering all these factors, the Court has to allow this\n\nPage 8 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nappeal and interfere with the impugned order by exercising\n\npowers under Order 43 Rule 1 read with\nSection 104\nof the\n\nCPC as prima facie it is made out that relinquishment deed\n\ndated 7.5.2018 is registered document and the Court cannot\n\nignore such registered document.\n\n4.9 In support of his submissions, learned senior\n\nadvocate Mr.Thakore has relied on the following citations:\n\n(1) Simiben @ Chimiben D/o Naranbhai Kalabhai & Anr.,\n\nreported in 2010(1) GLR 663\n\n(2) Pramukhkrupa Enterprise Through Managing Partners V/s\n\nKunverben Chaturdas Patel Thro poa Mahendrabhai C Patel,\n\nreported in 2015(1) GLR 169\n\n(3) Veetrag Holdings Private Limited V/s Gujarat State\n\nTextile Corporation Limited reported in 1996(3) GLR 536\n\n(4) Rattan Singh & Ors.

Learned senior advocate Mr. Patel appearing for\n\noriginal defendants no.1 to 4 who are the appellants in the\n\nAppeal No.12 of 2023 submits that he is supporting the\n\ndefendant no.5-appellant of Appeal From Order 13 of 2023 for\n\nwhom learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore is appearing. He\n\nsubmits that the defendant no.5 is the person to whom the\n\ndefendant nos.1 to 4 have sold the property in question.\n\n5.1 Learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore has submitted\n\nthat the defendant no.5 is willing to pay the entire amount\n\nof the agreed by way of agreement before the court and also\n\nhas submitted that even if the claim of the plaintiffs is to be\n\nconsidered, then also, there are several parcels of the land\n\nwhere there are no sale transactions taken place and are\n\nstill available for the plaintiffs for their share and therefore\n\nthe plaintiffs have no case on merits. Learned senior\n\nadvocate Mr.Patel has, by referring to the said contention\n\nraised by learned senior advocate Mr.Thakore, further added\n\nthat the relinquishment deed is dated 7.5.2018 which was\n\nregistered and thereafter after almost a period of 1 ½ years,\n\nthe plaintiffs have preferred the suit, therefore, the delay\n\nitself is required to be considered for not granting interim\n\nPage 10 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ninjunction against the defendants.\n\n5.2 Learned senior advocate Mr.Patel has further\n\nsubmitted, by drawing attention towards the notice issued\n\nunder Section 135D before the entry was certified which\n\nclearly indicates that the notice is served on the plaintiffs,\n\nand submitted that thereafter also, the plaintiffs have\n\nremained silent and therefore the sudden waking up after a\n\nperiod of more than 1 ½ years, clearly indicates the intention\n\nof the plaintiffs to snatch more money under the guise of\n\nsuch litigation from the subsequent purchaser. He has further\n\nsubmitted that if the plaintiffs had no objection at the\n\nrelevant point of time, they cannot rely on merely terms of\n\nMOU without referring to the subsequent document i.e.\n\nrelinquishment deed executed by the plaintiffs. If the\n\nplaintiffs would not have received any amount towards the\n\nsale consideration or their share, then naturally no prudent\n\nman will sign the document and that too by stating that the\n\nconsideration is received by them. That such relinquishment\n\ndeed is required to be considered which is a subsequent one\n\nand registered document and therefore the rights of the\n\nparties are now crystallized in view of the above mentioned\n\ndocuments and the plaintiffs have no locus to file the suit\n\nand pray for the prayers made in the suit. He, therefore,\n\nprays to allow this appeal from order by interfering with the\n\nPage 11 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nimpugned order.\n\n5.3 In support of his submission for delay and laches,\n\nlearned senior advocate Mr.Patel has relied on the judgment\n\nin the case of Harshadkumar Kantilal Bhalodwala and Anr.V/\n\ns Ishwarbhai Chandubhai Patel and Ors, reported in 2010(2)\nGLR 1041 by submitting that such delay, laches is fatal for\nsuch injunction and more particularly, when the plaintiffs can\n\nbe compensated in terms of money, no such injunction can be\n\ngranted.\n\n6. Per contra, learned senior advocate Mr.Shah for\nthe original plaintiffs in both the appeals has opposed these\n\nappeals from order. He submitted that the suit is filed by\n\nthe plaintiffs for partition, separate, possession, cancellation of\n\nrelinquishment deed, two agreements to sale, permanent\n\ninjunction and other ancillary reliefs on the specific case that\n\nthe plaintiffs are lineal descendants of Dhirajlal Gulabbhai\n\nand they are having 1/3rd share in all the disputed\n\nproperties and they also claim to be in possession of the\n\nproperty as co-sharers. He submitted that with regard to the\n\nproperties mentioned in paragraph 1A, no arguments are\n\nadvanced as the original defendant nos.1 to 4 have made a\n\nstatement to maintain status-quo qua the same.\n\nPage 12 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\n6.1 He submitted that as regards the property\n\nmentioned in paragraph 1B, on 23.4.2018, an undertaking\n\nwas entered into between the plaintiffs and defendant nos.1\n\nto 4 that they will pay certain amounts to the plaintiffs and\n\non such payment, they will relinquish their rights. He\n\nsubmitted that there is no averment made by the defendants\n\nin the written statement that any amount has been paid\n\ntowards sale consideration to the plaintiffs. He submitted that\n\nthe agreement was dated 23.4.2018 and they were called on\n\n7.5.2018 to execute a registered deed so as to put the\n\nundertaking in executable format; that as per the instructions\n\ngiven by the defendants, they answered in the affirmative\n\nbefore the Sub-Registrar that they have received the amount\n\nof consideration, though the document was titled as\n\n`relinquishment deed without consideration'. He submitted\n\nthat in law the relinquishment deed cannot be looked into\n\nfor evidence as the same is directly in contravention of\n\nSection 34\nof the Gujarat Stamp Act, 1958. He submitted\n\nthat the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that such a\n\nrelease/relinquishment deed is nothing but a gift deed and as\n\nper the Gujarat Stamp Act it has to be properly stamped to\n\nconsider the same into evidence, whereas in the present case,\n\nthe deed is executed on a stamp paper of Rs.100/- and\n\ntherefore the same has no evidentiary value and it is not\n\nadmissible in evidence. He submitted that the specific\n\nPage 13 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\npleadings in the plaint as regard to how the plaintiffs have\n\nbeen duped by coercion and pressure can always be\n\nconsidered for setting aside the relinquishment deed after\n\nfull-fledged trial.\n\n6.2 As regards service of Notice under Section 135 of\n\nthe Bombay Land Revenue Code, learned senior advocate\n\nMr.Shah has submitted that it is specifically stated that the\n\nsame was served on a third party before deleting the names\n\nof plaintiffs vide the mutation entry in pursuance of\n\npurported released deed and it is not coming on the record\n\nas to who was that lady on whom the notice was served and\n\nas the names of the plaintiffs were deleted from the revenue\n\nrecords, the plaintiffs were not aware about any subsequent\n\nentries including entries in respect of development permission,\n\nNA permission etc. and came to know about the same only\n\nafter 6.10.2020.\n\n6.3 As regards the agreement to sale executed by the\n\ndefendant nos.1 to 4 in favour of defendant no.5, learned\n\nsenior advocate Mr.Shah has submitted that the registered\n\nagreement to sale is executed by the defendant nos.1 to 3 in\n\nfavour of the defendant no.5 on 10.5.2019 whereas the\n\nregistered agreement to sale is executed by defendant no.4 in\n\nfavour of defendant no.5 on 22.10.2020 i.e. after a period of\n\nPage 14 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\n17 months. As regards giving away the possession to\n\ndefendant no.5, he submitted that it is unbelievable fact that\n\nthe defendant nos.1 to 4 have handed over the entire\n\npossession of property to the agreements to sale holders by\n\naccepting a meagre amount. He added that there is no\n\ndocument which shows that possession was handed over to\n\nthe defendant no.5-purchaser qua one of the properties and\n\nin fact, there is a specific condition in the agreement to sale\n\nthat possession shall not be handed over until the sale deed\n\nis executed.\n\n6.4 Learned senior advocate Mr.Shah, by referring to\n\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act, submits that the\n\nagreement to sale by itself does not create any interest in or\n\ncharge on such property except the right of executing sale\n\ndeed on that basis. The only right created in favour of the\n\nagreement to sale holder is to pray for specific performance\n\nof said agreement to sale. He submitted that no suit for\n\nspecific performance has been filed by the defendant no.5;\n\nthat the entire construction put up by the defendant no.5 is\n\nmade at their own risk and peril, as is stated by defendant\n\nno.5 before the learned lower court, and therefore now they\n\ncannot claim any equity before this Court for the construction\n\nmade during the pendency of the suit. He submitted that the\n\nlearned trial Court has rightly passed the order of status-quo\n\nPage 15 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nso that the property is preserved and not wasted away and\n\ntherefore, the impugned order is appropriate and need not be\n\ninterfered with. He, therefore, prayed to dismiss these appeals\n\nfrom orders.\n\n6.5 In support of his submissions, learned senior\n\nadvocate Mr.Shah has relied on the following citations:\n\n(1) Kuppuswami Chettiar V/s Arumugam Chettiar and\n\nAnother reported in AIR 1967 SC 1395, paragraph 4.\n\n(2) Venigalla Koteswaramma V/s Malampati Suryamba and\n\nOthers, reported in 2021 (4) SCC 246, paragraph 40\n\n(3) Wander Ltd.

Now, as regards the submissions made by learned\n\nsenior advocates for the appellants, there is no doubt about\n\nthe fact that the plaintiffs have approached the Court beyond\n\nthe period of 1 ½ years of the relinquishment deed is\n\nexecuted. However, for that, the plaintiffs have indicated the\n\nPage 29 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ncircumstances in the plaint itself which prima facie is\n\nrequired to be considered and perused for the purpose that\n\nwhether the plaintiffs are vigilant to pursue their remedy. It\n\ntranspires that the plaintiffs are residing at different place\n\nother than where the property is situated. The plaintiffs are\n\nmarried sisters and admittedly the plaintiffs are co-owners as\n\nproperties are ancestral and considering the provisions of\n\nSection 22\nof the Hindu Succession Act also, in the facts of\n\nthe present case, the defendants who happen to be the\n\nbrothers of the plaintiffs cannot sell the property of joint\n\nownership without the written consent and without paying\n\nany amount of consideration to the plaintiffs. Therefore,\n\nconsidering all these aspects, prima facie, the plaintiffs have\n\nestablished their case in the plaint by averring necessary\n\naverments in the plaint itself as well as Exh.5 application\n\nwhich clearly indicate that the prima facie case about the\n\nright of the plaintiffs is jeopardized by the action of the\n\ndefendants.\n\n11. The submissions made by learned senior advocate\n\nMr.Shah for the original plaintiffs, by referring to paragraphs\n\n19 and 22 of the plaint, that there is nothing on record to\n\nshow that that any amount is paid towards the consideration\n\nthough it is specifically mentioned in the MOU executed\n\nbetween the parties prior to the execution of the\n\nPage 30 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nrelinquishment deed that such amount is required to be paid\n\nand that Section 135D notice issued under the Bombay Land\n\nRevenue Code is not received by both the plaintiffs and\n\nsomebody has signed the notice are required to be contested\n\nat the time of trial.\n\n12. Further, the agreement to sale cannot confer any\n\nright, title or interest to the party concerned in absence of\n\npayment of entire sale consideration and valid document\n\nwhich is registered in accordance with law, no sale deed is\n\nexecuted between the defendants, there is nothing on record\n\nto show that the possession is handed over to the defendant\n\nno.5, the defendant no.5 has not filed any proceeding for\n\nspecific performance of the agreement to sale and execution\n\nof sale deed, the development permission which is allegedly\n\nproduced on the record by the defendants in support of their\n\ncase is merely a resolution passed by the village panchayat\n\nand no actual development permission granted by any\n\nauthority is produced on the record, then under which\n\nauthority the defendant no.5 has started the construction over\n\nthe land in question, knowing fully well that the dispute is\n\ngoing on between the parties. At the time of suit, merely the\n\ndisputed land was dug up and thereafter they have acted in\n\nhigh handed manner and taken risk by putting up further\n\nconstruction to three storeyed level, which itself creates\n\nPage 31 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nprejudice to the rights of the plaintiffs and therefore such\n\ncontention raised by learned senior advocate Mr.Patel that\n\nthere is no prima facie case or balance of convenience in\n\nfavour of the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs can be compensated\n\nin terms of money is not helpful to the defendants. The\n\napprehension of the plaintiffs that if the disputed land is\n\nsold and further right is created by third party there will be\n\nmore complication in the proceedings seems to be coming true\n\nin view of the construction put up by defendant no.5 and the\n\nlearned trial Court has rightly considered all these aspects.\n\n13. As regards the submission that the relinquishment\n\ndeed is executed pursuant to the MOU which is registered,\n\nthere is no doubt that the relinquishment deed is registered\n\nand the presumption is that the registered document is prima\n\nfacie valid in the eye of law. However, when the plaintiffs\n\nhave raised the serious dispute of the relinquishment deed\n\nitself by alleging that it is executed under undue pressure\n\nand misrepresenting the contents of the same which amount\n\nto fraudulent transaction which needs to be decided in a full-\n\nfledged trial by producing documentary evidence and therefore\n\nthe status-quo has to be granted for land in question during\n\nsuch trial, which is granted by the learned trial court with a\n\nview to to avoid multiplicity of proceedings. Thus, the learned\n\nPage 32 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ntrial Court has rightly exercised its discretion and it cannot\n\nbe said that the learned trial Court has not used its\n\ndiscretion judiciously and no infirmity or illegality is found in\n\nthe findings given by the learned trial Court.\n\n14. The learned trial Court cannot infer anything at\n\nthis stage more particularly while considering the prima facie\n\ncase, balance of convenience and irreparable loss on the basis\n\nof such document. All these arguments are required to be\n\nconsidered by the learned trial Court at the time of full\n\nfledged trial that whether the defendants have right to\n\nexecute any agreement to sale and thereafter the subsequent\n\npurchaser vendee has right to construct on the property in\n\nquestion on the basis of such agreement of sale more\n\nparticularly when the suit proceedings are pending, therefore,\n\nthe reasons assigned by the learned trial Court regarding\n\nfactors that the prima facie case as well as balance of\n\nconvenience, irreparable loss are found just and proper and\n\nno illegality or impropriety is committed by the learned trial\n\nCourt while reaching to the findings for granting injunction\n\nin the facts of the present case.\n\n15. There cannot be any dispute with regard to the\n\nratio laid down in the judgments cited by learned senior\n\nadvocate Mr.Thakore and learned senior advocate Mr.Patel for\n\nPage 33 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nthe defendants, however, these judgments are not squarely\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case except the fact\n\nthat the relinquishment deed is a registered document and\n\nalso regarding fraudulent transaction alleged by the parties.\n\nHowever, when the said registration itself is challenged, the\n\nsuit has to be tried fully to decide the rights of the parties.\n\n16. At this stage, it is relevant to refer to the\njudgment relied on by learned senior advocate Mr.Shah in\n\nthe case of Venigalla Koteswaramma (supra), more\n\nparticularly, paragraph 40, which reads as under:\n\n\"40. Apart from the above, it is also fundamental, as per\n\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, that an\nagreement for sale of immovable property does not, of itself,\ncreate any interest in or charge on such property. [ Vide\nBank of India v. Abhay D. Narottam, (2005) 11 SCC 520] A\nperson having an agreement for sale in his favour does not\nget any right in the property, except the right of obtaining\nsale deed on that basis [ Interestingly, in the present case,\nthe vendee or his legal representatives, claiming under the\nagreement for sale dated 5-11-1976 (Ext. B-10), did not seek\nspecific performance of the alleged agreement.] . For ready\nreference, we may reproduce\nSection 54\nof the Transfer of\nProperty Act that reads as under:\n\nPage 34 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\n\"54.\"Sale\" defined.--\"Sale\" is a transfer of ownership in\nexchange for a price paid or promised or part-paid and part-\n\npromised.\n\nSale how made.--Such transfer, in the case of tangible\nimmovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and\nupwards, or in the case of a reversion or other intangible\nthing, can be made only by a registered instrument.\n\nIn the case of tangible immovable property of a value\nless than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made\neither by a registered instrument or by delivery of the\nproperty.\n\nDelivery of tangible immovable property takes place when\nthe seller places the buyer, or such person as he directs, in\npossession of the property.\n\nContract for sale.--A contract for the sale of immovable\nproperty is a contract that a sale of such property shall\ntake place on terms settled between the parties.\n\nIt does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on\nsuch property.\"\n\nIt goes without saying that the alleged agreement for sale\ndid not invest the vendee with title to, or any interest in,\nthe property in question; and the alleged agreement for sale\ndid not invest the vendee with any such right that the\nplaintiff could not have maintained her claim for partition in\nrespect of the properties left by Annapurnamma without\nseeking declaration against the agreement. Therefore, this\nplea about non-maintainability of suit for want for relief of\n\nPage 35 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ndeclaration against the said agreement for sale remains\ntotally baseless and could only be rejected.\"\n\n17. The judgment in the case of Wander Ltd. (supra),\n\nit is held in paragraph 14 as under:\n\n\"14. The appeals before the Division Bench were against the\nexercise of discretion by the Single Judge. In such appeals, the\nappellate court will not interfere with the exercise of discretion of\nthe court of first instance and substitute its own discretion except\nwhere the discretion has been shown to have been exercised\narbitrarily, or capriciously or perversely or where the court had\nignored the settled principles of law regulating grant or refusal of\ninterlocutory injunctions. An appeal against exercise of discretion\nis said to be an appeal on principle. Appellate court will not\nreassess the material and seek to reach a conclusion different\nfrom the one reached by the court below if the one reached by\nthat court was reasonably possible on the material. The appellate\ncourt would normally not be justified in interfering with the\nexercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it\nhad considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come\nto a contrary conclusion. If the discretion has been exercised by\nthe trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that\nthe appellate court would have taken a different view may not\njustify interference with the trial court's exercise of discretion.\nAfter referring to these principles Gajendragadkar, J. In\nPrinters\n(Mysore) Private Ltd. v. Pothan Joseph\n[(1960) 3 SCR 713 : AIR\n1960 SC 1156] : (SCR 721)\n\nPage 36 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\n\"... These principles are well established, but as has been\nobserved by Viscount Simon in Charles Osenton & Co. v.\nJhanaton [1942 AC 130] '...the law as to the reversal by a court\nof appeal of an order made by a judge below in the exercise of\nhis discretion is well established, and any difficulty that arises is\ndue only to the application of well settled principles in an\nindividual case'.\"\n\nThe appellate judgment does not seem to defer to this principle.\"\n\nIt is also fruitful to refer to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of Suraj Land and Industries Pvt.Ltd. V/s State\nof Haryana reported in 2012(1) SCC 656, paragraphs 16, 18 and\n19 as under:\n\n\"Scope of an agreement of sale\n\n16.\nSection 54\nof the TP Act makes it clear that a contract of\nsale, that is, an agreement of sale does not, of itself, create any\ninterest in or charge on such property. This Court in\nNarandas\nKarsondas v. S.A. Kamtam\n[(1977) 3 SCC 247] observed: (SCC pp.\n254-55, paras 32-33 & 37)\n\n\"32. A contract of sale does not of itself create any interest in,\nor charge on, the property. This is expressly declared in\nSection\nof the Transfer of Property Act.\n(See Ram Baran Prasad v.\nRam Mohit Hazra [AIR 1967 SC 744 : (1967) 1 SCR 293] .) The\nfiduciary character of the personal obligation created by a contract\nfor sale is recognised in\nSection 3\nof the Specific Relief Act, 1963,\nand in\nSection 91\nof the Trusts Act. The personal obligation\ncreated by a contract of sale is described in\nSection 40\nof the\nTransfer of Property Act as an obligation arising out of contract\n\nPage 37 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nand annexed to the ownership of property, but not amounting to\nan interest or easement therein.\n\n33. In India, the word 'transfer' is defined with reference to\nthe word 'convey'. ... The word 'conveys' in\nSection 5\nof the\nTransfer of Property Act is used in the wider sense of conveying\nownership.\n\n***\n\n37. ... that only on execution of conveyance, ownership passes\nfrom one party to another....\"\n\n18.It is thus clear that a transfer of immovable property by way\nof sale can only be by a deed of conveyance (sale deed). In the\nabsence of a deed of conveyance (duly stamped and registered as\nrequired by law), no right, title or interest in an immovable\nproperty can be transferred.\n\n19.Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a\nregistered deed of conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of\nthe requirements of\nSections 54\nand\nof the TP Act and will\nnot confer any title nor transfer any interest in an immovable\nproperty (except to the limited right granted under\nSection 53-A\n\nof the TP Act). According to the TP Act, an agreement of sale,\nwhether with possession or without possession, is not a\nconveyance.\nSection 54\nof the TP Act enacts that sale of\nimmovable property can be made only by a registered instrument\nand an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge\non its subject-matter.\"\n\n18. There cannot be any dispute with regard to the\n\nPage 38 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nratio laid down in any of the judgments relied on by either\n\nof the parties. However, the judgments are required to be\n\nconsidered in the facts of each case.\n\n19. This Court has taken appropriate note about the\n\nconduct of the defendants, particularly, defendant no.5. The\n\ndefendants, knowing fully well that the suit proceedings are\n\npending for the subject matter, still they are trying to go on\n\nwith the construction. Not only that, when this Court, at the\n\ntime of issuance of notice has granted extension of stay order\n\ngranted by the learned trial Court against impugned order,\n\nunder the guise of the same, the construction is going on,\n\nwhich fact is confirmed by the learned advocates for all the\n\nparties during the course of arguments and photographs of\n\nrelevant development on the suit land are also produced for\n\nperusal of this Court. In this background, though prima facie\n\nit transpires that huge investment is made by the defendant\n\nno.5-appellant of Appeal No.13 of 2023 without any valid\n\ndocument of creation of conclusive title except the agreement\n\nto sale in favour of the appellant and in absence of execution\n\nof any sale deed or valid title over the property even then,\n\nproceeding further to construct huge structure on the\n\ndisputed land and thereafter claiming equity in their favour\n\nis required to be viewed strictly.\n\n20. In view of the above, considering the judgments\n\nPage 39 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nand considering the material available on the record, it\n\ntranspires that everything is done in highhanded manner by\n\nthe appellants as the agreement to sale did not invest the\n\nvendee with the valid title or any absolute interest in the\n\nproperty in question and the alleged agreement for sale\n\nwhich is without possession, did not invest vendee with any\n\nright against which the plaintiffs could not have maintained\n\ntheir claim for partition in respect of the property, the\n\nperson having any agreement to sale in his favour does not\n\nget any right in the property except right of obtaining sale\n\ndeed on that basis. Therefore, considering the undisputed fact\n\nthat the plaintiffs are co-owners of the property, that\n\nnowhere in the pleadings of the parties, more particularly, in\n\nthe written statement or anywhere the defendants have\n\naverred that any amount of sale consideration or share of the\n\nplaintiffs were paid to the plaintiffs, neither any documentary\n\nevidence is produced to indicate that such payment is made.\n\nIt clearly transpires that now the appellant of appeal no.13\n\nof 2023 has constructed huge portion and appellants of\n\nappeal no.12 of 2023 have no right to execute such\n\nagreement to sell and also regarding the document like MOU,\n\nrelease deed etc., and all these aspects require a full fledged\n\ntrial and if the status-quo is not maintained during the\n\npendency of the suit, rights and nature of suit property will\n\nchange and it may lead to multiple proceedings and the\n\nPage 40 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\ninterest of the plaintiffs may be lost in toto.\n\n21. In view of the above, these appeals are found\n\nmeritless and required to be dismissed as no perversity or\n\nillegality is found in the findings of the learned trial Court\n\nand the learned trial Court is just and proper in granting\n\ninterim injunction in the facts and circumstances of the\n\npresent case, within the four corners of Order 39 Rule 1 and\n\n2 read with\nSection 151\nof the CPC, more particularly, by\n\nconsidering prima facie and balance of convenience which\n\ngoes in favour of the plaintiffs and such development\n\npursuant to the alleged transaction is required to be\n\ndeprecated.\n\n22. Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed, by\n\nconfirming the findings given in the impugned order passed\n\nby the learned trial court below Exh.5. The stay of the\n\nimpugned order granted by the learned trial Court and\n\nextended by this Court is vacated forthwith.\n\n23. The appellants have shown utter disregard to the\n\nprocess of the court by proceeding further with the\n\nconstruction on the disputed property though the substantial\n\nproceedings are pending before the learned trial Court as\n\nwell as before this Court. It is needless to say that such\n\naction of development which is carried out till date by the\n\nPage 41 of 42\n\nDownloaded on : Wed Mar 20 20:50:52 IST 2024\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nC/AO/12/2023 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/03/2024\n\nundefined\n\nappellant-defendant no.5 is at his own risk and cost and\n\ntherefore no equity can be claimed by the appellant on that\n\ncount, looking to his conduct and accordingly the order\n\npassed by the learned trial Court is required to be complied\n\nwith in its true letter and spirit.\n\n24. As the appeals from order are dismissed, civil\n\napplications are also dismissed.\n\n(SANDEEP N. BHATT,J)\n\n25. After pronouncement of the judgment, learned\n\nsenior advocates Mr.B.S. Patel and Ms.Trusha Patel for the\n\nrespective appellants pray for extension of the interim relief,\n\nwhich is granted by this Court while issuing notice. The\n\nCourt has observed in the judgment that the construction has\n\nbeen carrying out during pendency of the suit as well as\n\neven these proceedings and any further construction will\n\ncertainly jeopardise the rights of either party. Therefore, the\n\nrequest made by learned senior advocates Mr. B.S.Patel and\n\nMs. Trusha Patel are refused.\n\n(SANDEEP N.
