(i) The common contentions urged in all these\n\npetitions are that, the offence alleged against the respective\n\npetitioners is a non-cognizable offence and by virtue of the\n\nsafeguard provided under\nSection 155(2)\nof Cr.P.C., the\n\nrespondent - Police could not have embarked upon\n\ninvestigation into the alleged offence, without the order of a\n\nMagistrate having power to try such case.\n\n(ii) In Support of this contention, the learned counsel\n\nhas referred to the decisions of this Court in the case of\n\nNabisab S/o Shek Imamsab V/s State of Karnataka\n\n(Crl.P.3365/2016 and connected matters disposed on\n\n07.04.2017) as well as the other decisions rendered by this\n\nCourt in the Case of Sharath @ Salim V/s The State of\n\nKarnataka (Crl.P.No.101833/2015 and connected petitions\n\n: 29 :\n\ndisposed on 18.12.2015), wherein this Court following the\n\ndecision passed by this Court in batch of petitions in\n\nCrl.P.No.100319/2014 has held that non-compliance of the\n\nmandatory requirements under\nSection 155(2)\nof Cr.P.C.\n\nwould render the proceedings illegal and invalid.\n\n(iii) The learned counsel has also produced a copy of\n\nthe order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in\n\nS.L.P.Nos.8567-8580/2016 arising out of the common order\n\npassed by this Court in Crl.P.No.100319/2014. The said\n\nS.L.P.Nos.8567-8580/2016 is dismissed by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India, thereby confirming the orders\n\npassed by this Court in Crl.P.No.100319/2014.\n\n3. In Crl.P.No.3365/2016 and connected matters,\n\nthis Court followed the decision rendered by the Coordinate\n\nBench of this Court in Moin Basha Kurnooli Vs. The State\n\nof Karnataka by Cowl Bazaar Police Station, Bellary,\n\nreported in 2014(4) KCCR 3355, wherein on analysing the\n\nrelevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and\n\nthe Karnataka Police Act, 1963, it is held that the offence\n\nunder\nSection 78(3)\nof the KP Act is a non-cognizable\n\noffence, the investigation whereof by a Police Officer is\n\nprohibited without prior order of the concerned Magistrate.\n\n: 30 :\n\nFurther this Court has laid down that the provisions of\n\nSection 155(2)\nof Cr.P.C. is mandatory in nature and failure\n\nto comply with the said mandatory requirement is an\n\nincurable defect amounting to illegality vitiating the entire\n\nproceedings.\n\n4. In Praveen Basavanneppa Shivalli Vs. State\n\nof Karnataka and Others reported in 2017(1) AKR 461,\n\nthis Court has laid down that a mere endorsement made by\n\nthe Magistrate on the application submitted by the Police\n\nOfficer under\nSection 155\nof Cr.P.C. as \"permitted\" is not an\n\n\"order\" in the eye of law and on that ground also, the\n\nproceedings initiated against the accused are rendered illegal\n\nand are liable to be quashed.\n\n5. Undisputedly, in all these proceedings, the FIR\n\ncame to be registered against the petitioners on the basis of\n\nthe complaint lodged by the Inspector of the Police of the\n\nrespective police stations alleging that on receipt of credible\n\ninformation that the accused herein were involved in playing\n\na game of chance by name Matka and were soliciting\n\ncustomers for the said purpose, the PSI of the respective\n\npolice stations made an application to the concerned\n\n: 31 :\n\nMagistrate seeking permission to investigate into the matter\n\nand thereafter rushed to the spot along with his team and\n\nthe panchas and found the accused engaged in the alleged\n\nactivities, and accordingly, panchanamas were drawn at the\n\nspot and incriminating materials were seized from the spot of\n\noccurrence and FIRs were registered against the respective\n\naccused persons alleging commission of offence punishable\n\nunder\nSection 78(3)\nof KP Act.\n\n6.

Undeniably, the offence alleged in each of the\n\nabove cases is a non-cognizable offence.\nSection 155\nof the\n\nCr.P.C. deals with the procedure of Investigation and\n\ncognizance of non-cognizable cases. It reads as under:\n\n\"\nSection 155\nInformation as to non-cognizable\ncases and investigation of such cases.\n\n(1) When information is given to an officer in charge\nof a police station of the commission within the limits\n\n: 33 :\n\nof such station of a non- cognizable offence, he shall\nenter or cause to be entered the substance of the\ninformation in a book to be kept by such officer in\nsuch form as the State Government may prescribe in\nthis behalf, and refer the informant to the Magistrate.\n(2) No police officer shall investigate a non- cognizable\ncase without the order of a Magistrate having power to\ntry such case or commit the case for trial.\n(3) Any police officer receiving such order may\nexercise the same powers in respect of the\ninvestigation (except the power to arrest without\nwarrant) as an officer in charge of a police station may\nexercise in a cognizable case.\n\n(4) Where a case relates to two or more offences of\nwhich at least one is cognizable, the case shall be\ndeemed to be a cognizable case, notwithstanding that\nthe other offences are non- cognizable.\"\n\n8. As per the above provision, when an Officer-in-\n\ncharge of the police station received the information as to the\n\ncommission of non-cognizable offence, (i) he shall enter or\n\ncaused to be entered the substance of the information in a\n\nbook to be maintained by the said Officer in a prescribed\n\nform and (ii) refer the informant to the Magistrate. Further,\n\nSub-Section (2) of\nSection 155\nCr.P.C. mandates that no\n\nPolice Officer shall investigate a non-cognizable offence\n\nwithout the order of a Magistrate having power to try such\n\ncase or commit such case for trial.\n\n: 34 :\n\n9. In the instant case, the respondent police have\n\nutterly failed to comply with the requirements laid down in\n\nSection 155(1)\nand\n155(2)\nof Cr.P.C. Reading of the\n\ncomplaints lodged in each case indicate that on receipt of\n\ninformation, the complainant informed the matter to his\n\nsuperior officer and thereafter made separate applications to\n\nthe concerned Magistrate seeking necessary order for\n\ninvestigation into the allegations. But before securing the\n\nnecessary \"order\", the complainants in the above cases,\n\nrushed to the spot and commenced investigation even\n\nwithout registration of the FIR as mandated under\nSection\nof Cr.P.C. There is nothing on record to show that the\n\nrespondent has referred the informant to the concerned\n\nMagistrate as required under\nSection 155(1)\nof Cr.P.C. or\n\nobtained necessary order as envisaged under\nSection 155(2)\n\nof Cr.P.C. before embarking upon investigation. Thus, on the\n\nface of it, the respondents are seen to have committed\n\nblatant violation of the provisions of Sections 155(1) and\n\n155(2) of Cr.P.C.\n\n10. The learned HCGP appearing for the State,\n\nhowever, has tried to take shelter under the endorsement\n\nobtained by the respondents - Police on the applications\n\n: 35 :\n\nwherein, the learned Magistrate is seen to have made an\n\nendorsement as \"permitted\". It is argued that this is\n\nsubstantial compliance of the requirements laid down under\n\nsection 155\nof Cr.P.C. It is the submission of the learned\n\nHCGP that, in the decision referred to by the learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner, in\nMoin Basha Karnooli Vs. State of\n\nKarnataka\n(2014 (4) KCCR 3355, as well as in Sharath @\n\nSalim Vs. The State of Karnataka (Crl.P.No.101833/2015 &\n\nconnected matters), the Investigating Officer failed to submit\n\nthe necessary application and did not obtain any order from\n\nthe concerned Magistrate and in that circumstance, this\n\nCourt found it appropriate to quash the proceedings on the\n\nground that the Police failed to comply with the mandatory\n\nrequirements prescribed under\nSection 155(2)\nof Cr.P.C. In\n\nother words, the submission of the learned HCGP is that, in\n\nthe instant case, by making necessary application to the\n\nconcerned Magistrate, the respondents have substantially\n\ncomplied with the requirements of\nSection 155\nof Cr.P.C. and\n\ntherefore, there is no irregularity much less any illegality\n\nwhatsoever in the action initiated by the respondents against\n\nthe petitioners.\n\n: 36 :\n\n11. I am unable to accept the contention urged by\n\nthe learned HCGP. This contention has already been\n\nconsidered by this Court in the case of Praveen B. Shivalli\n\n(supra). Even in the said case, endorsement was made by\n\nthe learned Magistrate on the application submitted by the\n\npolice as \"permitted\". Considering the purport of the above\n\nprovision and the purpose and object of prescribing such a\n\npre-requisite, this Court in para 15 of the aforesaid judgment\n\nhas observed as under:\n\n\"15. In the present case, 2nd respondent having acted\ncontrary to sub-section (1) of\nSection 155\nCr.P.C. and\nthe learned Magistrate having not passed 'an order',\ninstead, having made an entry 'permitted', being not\n'an order' in the eye of law and in view of the\nprohibition contained in sub-section (2) of\nS.155\n\nCr.P.C., the investigation; made and the consequential\ncharge-sheet filed for the offences under Ss.504, 506\nand 323 of\nIPC\nand the taking of cognizance of those\noffences and the issue of non-bailable warrant in the\nfirst instance itself for proceeding further with the case\nagainst the accused are absolutely illegal. It is\nobvious that the police and the Magistrate have not\nbothered to look into\nS.155\nCr.P.C. before proceeding\nfurther in the matter. Non application of mind and\nmechanical approach to the case are apparent.\"\n\n: 37 :\n\n12. In view of the above factual and legal defects\n\nwhich amount to incurable illegalities and blatant violation of\n\nthe mandatory requirements of law, all the above\n\nproceedings are liable to be quashed.\n\n13. Resultantly, all the petitions are allowed. the\n\nFIRs filed in all the above cases as detailed in the table\n\nhereinabove at para 6 and consequent proceedings arising\n\ntherefrom are hereby quashed.\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\n\ngab",
