He is Jeth (brother-in-law) of\n\nPriyanka (since deceased), whose marriage was solemnized with his\n\nbrother Dilip Dohare on 26/4/2019.\n\n \nAllegations against the applicant, in short, are that he along\n\nwith other accused persons was involved in subjecting Priyanka to\n\ncruelty and harassment due to non satisfaction of demand for dowry\n\nand, ultimately, on 3/3/2021, dead body of Priyanka was found\n\nhanging in her matrimonial home only under suspicious\n THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C.No.17877/2021\n\n (\nKuldeep Dohre Vs. State of M.P\n.)\n\n (2)\n\ncircumstances.\n\n Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant\n\nbeing brother-in-law of the deceased, has been falsely implicated.\n\nHe has been residing separately in Surat (Gujarat). Omnibus\n\nallegations have been levelled against all the family members and\n\nno specific overt act has been assigned to the applicant. Mother of\n\nthe applicant is suffering from Cancer and is under treatment. Due\n\nto COVID-19 outbreak, detention of applicant in already congested\n\nprisons may be detrimental. The applicant is a permanent resident of\n\nSurat (Gujarat) and there is no likelihood of his absconsion or\n\ntampering with the prosecution evidence. With the aforesaid\n\nsubmissions, prayer for anticipatory bail is made.\n\n On the other hand, learned Additional Advocate General has\n\nopposed the anticipatory bail application and prays for its rejection.\n\nIt is submitted that from the statements of witnesses, it is clear that\n\ndemand of Rs.8 lacs in dowry had already been fulfilled, but the\n\ndeceased was being harassed for remaining Rs.2 lacs. Besides,\n\nparents of the deceased have categorically stated that all the family\n\nmembers were involved in demanding dowry and meting out cruelty\n\nand harassment to the deceased. Investigation is pending and\n\ncustodial interrogation may be required.\n\n \nTHE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n\n M.Cr.C.No.17877/2021\n\n (\nKuldeep Dohre Vs. State of M.P\n.)\n\n (3)\n\n In response, learned counsel for the applicant submitted that\n\napplicant being brother-in-law is a distant relative. He has been\n\nstaying in an altogether different city in Gujarat and has been roped\n\nin just because he is a family member.\n \nTo buttress his submissions,\n\nattention has been invited to decision of the Apex Court in the case\n\nof \nK.Subba Rao and Others Vs. State of Telangana\n ((2018)14\n\nSCC 452), wherein it has been held that the Courts should be\n\ncareful in proceeding against the distant relatives in crimes\n\npertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths.\n\n However, it would not be desirable to enter into merits of the\n\nrival contentions at this juncture.\n\n Taking into consideration the overall facts and circumstances\n\nof the case, but without expressing any opinion on merits of the\n\ncase, I deem it appropriate to extend the benefit of anticipatory bail\n\nto the applicant.\n\n \nThe application is, accordingly, allowed and it is hereby\n\ndirected that in the event of arrest of the applicant, he shall be\n\nreleased on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/-\n\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with a solvent surety in the like\n\namount to the satisfaction of Arresting Authority.
