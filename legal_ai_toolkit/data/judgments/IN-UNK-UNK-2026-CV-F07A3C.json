Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgement ?\n2. To be referred to the Reporter or not ?\n3. Whether the judgement should be reported in the Digest ?\n\nM.M.KUMAR, J.\n\n The petitioner, who is a Senior Lecturer in Mathematics, has\n\napproached this Court with a prayer for declaring the Haryana Technical\n\nEducation Department (Group A) Service (Amendment) Rules, 2008 as\n\nunconstitutional which have been notified on 11.11.2008. The grievance\n\nmade by the petitioner is that the explanation added by amendment in\n\nColumn 4 of Appendix B referred to by Rule 7 is obnoxious and offends\n\nher right to seek promotion to the post of Head of the Department which is a\n\npromotional post from the feeder cadre of Senior Lecturer. She has also\n\nprayed for quashing order dated 19.12.2008 granting promotion to Smt.\n\nBenu Bajaj- respondent no.3 to the post of Head of Department on the\n\nground that she is junior to the petitioner.\n\n FACTS : Smt.Geeta Devi had acquired the qualification of\n\nM.Sc. (Maths) and is pursuing her Ph.D programme. Before her\n\nappointment on the post of Sr. Lecturer in Applied Sciences (Maths) in the\n\nrespondents department she had acquired rich experience of working as a\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 2\n\nLecturer in Government Polytechnic or Private Polytechnic Colleges. She\n\nwas appointed as Lecturer in Maths at Government Polytechnic College,\n\nSonepat on 24.8.1995 where she served till 11.11.2002. The post was\n\ndeclared surplus and she was relieved of her duties. Thereafter she served as\n\na Lecturer for 1 years and 4 months at Ch. Devi Lal Memorial Engineering\n\nCollege, Panniwala Mota, Sirsa. She was relieved from that post on\n\n17.12.2004. Then she applied for the post of Sr. Lecturer in Mathematics\n\nthrough Haryana Public Service Commission. On the basis of her\n\nexperience of over 8 years which was a necessary requirement for\n\nappointment as Sr. Lecturer she was selected by the Haryana Public Service\n\nCommission and appointed as such vide appointment letter dated\n\n15.12.2004 ( P.1). She has been serving as Senior Lecturer since 18.12.2004\n\nand has obviously acquired more than four years experience as such.\n\n A Senior Lecturer is entitled to be considered for promotion as\n\nHead of the Department as per statutory rules known as Haryana Technical\n\nEducation Department (Group A) Service Rules, 1986 (for brevity 'the\n\nRules'). According to Rule 7, a Senior Lecturer in order to earn promotion\n\nto the post of Head of Department (Applied Sciences) is required to fulfill\n\nthe qualifications as specified in Appendix B which in turn provides 12\n\nyears experience as a lecturer out of which two years must be as a Senior\n\nLecturer. It has remained undisputed that in the seniority list, the name of\n\nthe petitioner stands at serial No.3. In order to stake her claim for\n\npromotion to the post of Head of Department (Mathematics), the petitioner\n\nfiled a representation through proper channel on 2.6.2008 (P.3). She\n\nclaimed that she was senior-most and fulfilled all the qualifications. She\n\nalso asserted that the post of Head of Department was lying vacant and\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 3\n\ntherefore she was fully entitled to be considered for promotion to that post.\n\nHowever, the representation did not evoke any response. It is further\n\npertinent to mention that the post of Head of Department is lying vacant\n\nearlier to June, 2008. This fact has assumed significance because the\n\nexpression 'experience' used in Appendix B in item No.20 'Head of the\n\nDepartment in Applied Sciences\" has been explained by amendment made\n\non 11.11.2008 requiring that the term 'experience' was to mean the service\n\nrendered in the department of Technical Education Haryana after regular\n\nappointment on the post. On account of the aforesaid amendment, the claim\n\nof the petitioner has been rejected and her junior respondent no.3- Mrs.\n\nBenu Bajaj has been promoted on the post of Head of the Department in\n\nApplied Sciences (Maths). The petitioner has also asserted that respondent\n\nno.3. Benu Bajaj had been appointed on the post of Senior Lecturer on\n\n16.1.2006 when a new post for her was created in the cadre of Senior\n\nLecturers. According to the petitioner, all this has been done on extraneous\n\nconsiderations. It is in the aforesaid circumstances that the petitioner has\n\napproached this Court asserting her claim for promotion to the post of Head\n\nof the Department.\n\n In the written statement, the broad factual matrix has not been\n\ndisputed. It remains uncontroverted that the petitioner is senior to\n\nrespondent no.3- Benu Bajaj in the seniority list of Senior Lecturers and her\n\nname in the gradation list (P.2) figures at serial no.3 whereas that of\n\nrespondent no.3. Benu Bajaj is shown at serial No.4. It has also not been\n\ndisputed that the petitioner has worked on the post of Lecturer albeit on\n\nadhoc basis. The whole case of the respondents hinges on the amendment\n\nincorporated on 11.11.2008. It has been asserted that the petitioner did not\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 4\n\nhave experience in accordance with the amended definition of term\n\n'experience' added by explanation on 11.11.2008 and only the experience\n\nwhich is gained by a Lecturer during regular service was to be counted for\n\npromotion to the post of Head of the Department. The stand of the\n\nrespondents becomes more pronounced from the panel of Senior Lecturers\n\nprepared in order of their seniority for consideration of various names for\n\npromotion to the post of Head of the Department, which reads as under:\n\n Name No. of Name of Experience Experience Remarks.\n\n of the posts incumbent to be as Lecturer as Senior\n post to be considered for the in regular Lecturer in\n filled promotion, in service regular\n up by order to their service\n promot seniority\n ion\n HOD i)Geeta Devi, Nil 18.12.04 to Smt.Geeta Devi\n Senior Lecturer in till date = 4 has only\n Mathematics, GP years experience of 4\n Sonepat years after her\n regular\n appointment in\n the Department,\n hence not\n eligible for\n promotion due\n to shortage of\n requisite\n 1 experience.\n ii) Benu Bajaj, Sr. 9.5.95 to 3.12.04 to Smt. Benu Bajaj\n Lecturer in 2.12.04 9 till date 4 has completed\n Mathematics, GP years 7 years requ8isite\n Nilokheri months experience of 12\n years out of\n which 2 years as\n Senior Lecturer\n after her regular\n appointment\n hence eligible\n for promotion.\n Iii) Roshan Lal, 6.5.1995 to 24.2.06 to Sh.Roshan Lal\n Senior Lecturer in 23.6.2006 till date = 2 has completed\n Mathematics, regular basis years 9 requisite\n GPW, Ambala = 10 years 9 months experience of 12\n months years out of\n which 2 years as\n Senior Lecturer\n after his regular\n appointment\n hence eligible\n for promotion.\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 5\n\n Accordingly it has been claimed that respondent no.3 Benu\n\nBajaj has experience of 13 ½ years of regular service as Lecturer/ Senior\n\nLecturer whereas the petitioner had only 4 years experience after her regular\n\nappointment as Sr. Lecturer in the respondent- Department, which has been\n\ndetermined as per the amended rule. It has thus been submitted that the\n\nsame cannot be regarded as sufficient. It has further been asserted that on\n\nthe date of making representation on 2.6.2008, the petitioner had only 10\n\nyears 8 months experience which she has gained as Lecturer in Mathematics\n\n(adhoc basis) at Govt. Polytechnic, Sonepat from 24.8.1995 to 11.11.2002\n\n(7 years 2 months and 15 days) and of Senior Lecturer from 18.12.2004 to\n\n2.6.2008 (3 years 5 months and 18 days). It has accordingly been claimed\n\nthat she has only 10 years 8 months total experience of service on adhoc/\n\nregular basis and in any case she did not fulfill the requirement of 12 years\n\nexperience. It is thus obvious that the experience gained by the petitioner\n\nwhile working at Ch. Devi Lal Memorial Engineering college Panniwala\n\nMota, Sirsa for 1 year 4 months has not been considered which would show\n\nthat she had acquired more than 12 years experience even on the date of\n\nmaking representation. The respondents have also placed reliance on Rule 9\n\n(2) of the Rules to argue that seniority alone cannot be the rationale basis\n\nfor earning promotion and merit of a candidate is also required to be\n\nconsidered and that in any case no one can claim promotion as a matter of\n\nright. The respondent nos. 1 and 2 have therefore defended the promotion\n\ngranted to respondent no.3. Benu Bajaj who is stated to have joined as Head\n\nof the Department in Mechtronics at Government Polytechnic, Nilokheri\n\n(R.2) on 22.11.2008.\n\n A separate written statement has also been filed by respondent\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 6\n\nno.3. Benu Bajaj. According to the preliminary objection raised by her it has\n\nbeen asserted that the expression 'experience' has always been construed as\n\nexperience gained by an incumbent within the department and in order to\n\nremove the ambiguity the explanation was added on 11.11.2008. According\n\nto the averments made in the written statement the amendment is the result\n\nof circular letter issued by the Chief Secretary, Government Haryana on\n\n8.8.2007 to all the Departments asking them to amend the departmental\n\nservice rules by replacing the term' experience' as 'service rendered in the\n\nDepartment of Technical Education' for promotion to the higher post. A\n\ncopy of the circular has been placed on record as Annexure R/3/1. As a\n\nresult of the circular, the amendment has been incorporated on 11.11.2008.\n\nRespondent no.3 Benu Bajaj has also asserted that she was appointed on\n\nregular basis as Lecturer w.e.f. 9.5.1995 to 2.12.2004 and thereafter she\n\njoined as Senior Lecturer on regular basis w.e.f. 3.12.2004. Accordingly she\n\nhas claimed experience of working on regular basis for more than 13 years\n\nwhereas regular experience of the petitioner is only of four years.\n\nRIVAL CONTENTIONS: Mr. Y.P. Malik, learned counsel for\n\nthe petitioner has submitted that any vacancy which has arisen before the\n\namendment of the rules is required to be filled up in accordance with un-\n\namended rules. \nAccording to the learned counsel 'experience' gained by the\n\npetitioner while working as Lecturer even on adhoc basis cannot be ignored\n\nmerely because amendment has been incorporated on 11.11.2008 in\n\nAppendix \"B\" read with Rule 7 of the rules. He has maintained that the\n\nexpression 'experience' cannot be restricted in its meaning by the\n\namendment made on 11.11.2008. Therefore it has been urged that the un-\n\namended rules would apply and the expression 'experience' would be wide\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 7\n\nenough to include that experience which she gained while working on the\n\npost on adhoc basis which may be in other department . For the proposition\n\nthat a vacancy which has to be filled up by promotion would be governed by\n\nthe un-amended rules, learned counsel has placed reliance on para 9\n\njudgement of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of \nY.V.Rangaiah v.\n\nJ.Sreenivasa Rao\n (1983) 3 SCC 285.\n\n Ms. Ritu Bahri, learned State counsel has, however, argued that\n\nthe respondent state has taken a conscious decision to avoid consideration\n\nof experience gained by the candidate outside the department and\n\naccordingly amendment has been incorporated on 11.11.2008. According to\n\nher such an amendment could not be regarded as mala-fide because it would\n\napply to a large number of other employees who are to be considered for\n\npromotion to the post of Head of Department in other disciplines, as is\n\nevident from the perusal of Appendix B. She has argued that the experience\n\ngained by the petitioner while working on adhoc basis as Lecturer cannot be\n\ntaken into count nor her experience gained while working in a private\n\ncollege would be relevant. It has thus been submitted that the petitioner is\n\ntotally ineligible for consideration for promotion to the post of Head of the\n\nDepartment.\n\n Mr. Parveen Gupta, learned counsel for respondent no.3 has\n\nvehemently argued that respondent no.3 is a regularly recruited Lecturer\n\nthrough Public Service Commission and she has been working on regular\n\nbasis w.e.f. 9.5.1995 upto 2.12.2004 and thereafter she has joined as Senior\n\nLecturer w.e.f. 3.12.2004. According to the learned counsel it would be very\n\nharsh if her claim is to be ignored as against the claim of the petitioner who\n\nhad gained her whole experience as Lecturer while working on adhoc basis.\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 8\n\nHe has maintained that the petitioner has regular experience of working of\n\nonly for four years as Senior Lecturer which according to the amended rules\n\ncould be taken into account.\n\nCONCLUSION: After hearing learned counsel for the parties,\n\nperusing the record with their able assistance and the rules it would first be\n\nimperative to examine the rules which are applicable. Rule 7 of the Rules\n\nspecify the qualifications for appointment to any post in service i.e. Haryana\n\nTechnical Education Department (Group A) Service which in turn refers to\n\nAppendix B for qualification and experience. Accordingly rule 7 of the\n\nrules alongwith relevant portion of Appendix 'B' is set out below:\n\n \"7. Qualifications.- No person shall be appointed to any post in\n\n the service, unless he is in possession of qualifications and\n\n experience specified in column 3 of Appendix B to these rules\n\n in the case of direct recruitment and those specified in column 4\n\n of the aforesaid Appendix in the case of appointment other than\n\n by direct recruitment:\n\n Provided that in the case of direct recruitment, the\n\n qualifications regarding experience shall be relaxable to the\n\n extent of 50% at the discretion of the Commission or any other\n\n recruiting authority in case sufficient number of candidates\n\n belonging to Scheduled Castes/ Backward Class/ Ex-\n\n servicemen and physically handicapped candidates, possessing\n\n the requisite experience, are not available to fill up the\n\n vacancies reserved for them, after recording reasons for so\n\n doing in writing.\"\n\n xx xx xx xx xx xx xx\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 9\n\n APPENDIX- B\n\n Sl. Description Academic qualifications and experience, Academic\n No of post if any, for direct recruitment qualifications and\n experience, if any,\n for appointment\n other than by\n direct recruitment\n\n 1 2 3 4\n\n 1 to 19 xx xx xx xx xx xx\n\n Head of i) First Class Master's degree in 12 years experience\n Department Physics/Chemistry/ Mathematics/ English as Lecturers in\n in Applied from a recognized University/ Institute Applied Sciences\n Sciences ii) 8 years experience as Lecturer in a out of which 2 years\n\n University or college affiliated to a as Senior Lecturer\n in Applied Sciences.\n\n recognized University/ Institute;\n\n iii) Knowledge of Hindi upto Matric\n 20 standard.\n\n A perusal of the aforesaid Rule 7 read with Appendix 'B' would show\n\nthat for promotion to the post of Head of the Department in Applied\n\nSciences, 12 years experience as Lecturer in Applied Sciences is required\n\nwith a further stipulation that out of those 12 years atleast two years must be\n\nspent as a Senior Lecturer. Therefore the expression 'experience' used in\n\ncolumn 4 of Appendix B did not have any further limitation. It is further\n\nspecified by adding the Explanation on 11.11.2008 at the end of column\n\nNo.4 as under:\n\n \" Explanation.- The term 'experience' as used herein shall mean\n\n the service rendered in the Department of Technical Education,\n\n Haryana, after regular appointment on the post.\"\n\n A perusal of the added explanation shows that the term 'experience' is\n\nto mean service rendered by a candidate in the department of Technical\n\nEducation, Haryana after his appointment on regular basis on the post. In\n\nother words, the explanation has excluded any experience gained by the\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 10\n\npetitioner while working on a post other than on regular basis or in a private\n\nrecognised institution.\n\n The method of recruitment for the post of Head of the\n\nDepartment in Applied Sciences, however, has been provided by Rule 9(i)\n\n(q) of the Rules. Rule 9.2 of the Rules further provides criterion to be\n\nfollowed for promotion. It would be necessary to read the aforementioned\n\nrule which reads as under:\n\n \"9. Method of recruitment.- (1) Recruitment to the Service shall\n\n be made-\n\n (a) to (p) xx xx xx xx\n\n (q) in the case of Head of Department in applied Sciences,-\n\n ii) 75% by promotion from amongst Senior Lecturers in\n\n Applied Sciences, and\n\n iii) 25% by direct recruitment; or\n\n iv) by transfer or deputation of an officer already in the service\n\n of any State Government or the Government of India.\"\n\n \" 9(2) All promotions, unless otherwise provided, shall be made\n\n on seniority cum merit basis and seniority alone shall not give\n\n any right to such promotions.\"\n\n It is thus evident that 75% of the posts of Head of the Department in\n\nApplied Science are to be filled up by promotion from amongst the Senior\n\nLecturers and 25% by direct recruitment on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n\nalthough seniority alone is not to be taken into as determinating factor. It is\n\nwell settled that when any promotions are to be made on the basis of\n\nseniority cum merit, the element of seniority is to be given due\n\nconsideration unless on merit the service record has been found to be so\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 11\n\nadverse which renders him useless. The meaning assigned to 'seniority\n\n-cum- merit rules' is that given the minimum necessary merit requisite for\n\nefficiency of the service, the seniority is to be given priority although senior\n\nmay be lesser meritorious than his junior. \nIn that regard reliance may be\n\nplaced on the observations made by a Constitution Bench of Hon'ble the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of \nState of Kerala v. M.M.Thomas\n (1976)2 SCC\n\n310; \nM.M.Gupta v. State of Jammu and Kashmir\n (1982) 3 SCC 412.\n\n In the aforesaid factual backdrop following two substantive\n\nquestions of law which would arise for determination are:\n\n (1)Whether the vacancy of Head of Department in Applied\n\n Sciences which has arisen before 11.11.2008 would be\n\n governed by the amended definition of expression\n\n 'experience' or the un-amended rules would continue to\n\n apply to it;\n\n (2) Whether the expression 'experience' used in un-amended\n\n rules would include the experience gained while working on\n\n adhoc basis on the post of Lecturer in a Government\n\n Polytechnic College as well as in a private recognised\n\n institute.\n\n Re. Question no. 1.\n\n \nThe question whether amended rules could be applied to the\n\nvacancy which has arisen before the amendment is no longer res-integra.\n\nHon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of \nY.V.Rangaiah\n (supra) has\n\nconsidered the aforesaid question as early as in 1983 and has concluded in\n\npara 9 of the judgement as under:\n\n \"9. Having heard the counsel for the parties, we find no force in\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 12\n\n either of the two contentions. Under the old rules a panel had to\n\n be prepared every year in September. Accordingly, a panel\n\n should have been prepared in the year 1976 and transfer or\n\n promotion to the post of Sub-Registrar Grade II should have\n\n been made out of that panel. In that event the petitioners in the\n\n two representation petitions who ranked higher than the\n\n respondents Nos. 3 to 15 would not have been deprived of their\n\n rights of being considered for promotion. The vacancies which\n\n occurred prior to the amended rules would be governed by the\n\n old rules and not by the amended rules. It is admitted by\n\n counsel for both the parties that henceforth promotion to the\n\n post of Sub-Registrar Grade II will be according to the new\n\n rules on the zonal basis and not on the Statewide basis and\n\n therefore, there was no question of challenging the new rules.\n\n But the question is of filling the vacancies that occurred prior to\n\n the amended rules. We have not the slightest doubt that the\n\n posts which fell vacant prior to the amended rules would be\n\n governed by the old rules and not by the new rules.\" (emphasis\n\n added).\n\n The afore-mentioned view has been followed and applied repeatedly\n\nby Hon'ble the Supreme Court. \nIn the case of \nState of Rajasthan v.\n\nR.Dayal and others\n (1997) 10 SCC 419 the principles have been reiterated\n\nin para 8 of the judgement. The relevant extracts are set out below:\n\n \n\" ......................But the question is whether selection would be\n\n made, in the case of appointment to the vacancies which\n\n admittedly arose after the amendment of the Rules came into\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 13\n\n force, according to the amended Rules or in terms of Rule 9\n\n read with Rules 23 and 24-A, as mentioned hereinbefore? This\n\n Court has considered the similar question in paragraph 9 of the\n\n judgment above cited. This Court has specifically laid that the\n\n vacancies which occurred prior to the amendment of the Rules\n\n would be governed by the original Rules and not by the\n\n amended Rules. Accordingly, this Court had held that posts\n\n which fell vacant prior to the amendment of the Rules would be\n\n governed by the original Rules and not the amended Rules. As\n\n a necessary corollary, the vacancies that arose subsequent to the\n\n amendment of the Rules are required to be filled in accordance\n\n with the law existing as on the date when the vacancies\n\n arose..............\" (emphasis added)\n\n The principles \nlaid down in\n \nY.V.Rangaiah\n's case (supra) have further\n\nbeen applied and followed by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in the case of\n\nDelhi Judicial Service Association v. Delhi High\n Court and \nothers (2001) 5\n\nSCC 145 and Arjun Singh Rathore and others v. B.N.Chaturvedi and others\n\n(2007)11 SCC 605.\n\n It is pertinent to notice that no contrary view has been cited\n\nbefore us and therefore we will take it a well settled principle of service\n\njurisprudence that a vacancy which has arisen before the amendment of the\n\nRules has to be filled up in accordance with the un-amended rules and not\n\nas per the provisions of the amended rules.\n\n Re. Question No. 2\n\n The second question is also not res-integra. As long as the\n\nexpression 'experience' as against the word 'service' is used in the statutory\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 14\n\nrules which are applicable, the law \nlaid down by\n this Court would continue\n\nto apply. It is obvious that once the unamended rules are applicable which\n\nuse the expression 'experience' then the word 'experience' has to be\n\nconstrued. In some what similar circumstances, the expression 'experience'\n\ncame up for interpretation of this Court in the case of Dr. Ravinder Pal\n\nKaur v.State of Punjab and others 1979(2) SLR 645. In the aforesaid case,\n\nthe statutory rules required teaching experience as Assistant Professor in the\n\nspecialty concerned for five years. The petitioner \nin that case\n was appointed\n\nas Assistant Professor Radiology on adhoc basis. Her appointment was\n\nregularised three years later.The question before the Court was whether the\n\nexperience gained by her while working on adhoc basis could be treated as\n\n'experience' in terms of the requirement of the rules. The learned Single\n\nJudge of this Court has taken the view that there was hardly any difference\n\nso far as the teaching experience is concerned whether it is gained on adhoc\n\nappointment or on regular appointment. It was held that the teaching\n\nexperience envisaged by the statutory rules was not limited to the one\n\ngained while holding appointment on regular basis under the statutory\n\nrules. Therefore the teaching experience gained by her in the Medical\n\nColleges while working on adhoc basis is valid for the purpose of counting\n\nthe requisite experience for direct appointment as Professor. Such\n\nexperience could not be ignored. \nThe aforesaid view has been followed and\n\napplied by this Court in the case of Balbir Singh Yadav and others v.State of\n\nHaryana and others 1984(1) SLR 466 and a Division Bench of this Court in\n\nthe case of \nDharam Singh v. State of Punjab and others\n 1985(1) SLR 358.\n\nTherefore, the principle which emerges from the aforesaid case law is that\n\nonce an employee has gained experience of working on adhoc or regular\n\n CWP No. 21663 of 2008 15\n\nbasis then the requirement of the rule stands satisfied. It is not material\n\nwhether such an experience has been gained while working on adhoc basis\n\nor on regular basis. As long as a person has earned the experience of\n\nworking on teaching post like Lecturer or Senior Lecturer then such an\n\nexperience cannot be ignored and on that basis the petitioner could not have\n\nbeen non-suited from consideration for promotion to the post of the Head of\n\nthe Department. On principle and precedent both the questions have to be\n\nanswered in favour of the petitioner.\n\n When the aforesaid principles are applied to the facts of the\n\npresent case it becomes obvious that on the date of consideration of her case\n\nin December, 2008 the petitioner had more than 12 years service. She also\n\nfulfilled the condition of working atleast two years on the post of Senior\n\nLecturer. Moreover, she has been senior to respondent no.3 in the cadre of\n\nSr. Lecturers and the principle of seniority -cum- merit is applicable as\n\nprovided by Rule 9(2) of the Rules. Accordingly, it is held that the case of\n\nthe petitioner is required to be considered by respondents in accordance\n\nwith the unamended rules. The explanation added on 11.11.2008 would not\n\napply to her case. It is, therefore, held that the experience gained by the\n\npetitioner on adhoc basis or in a private recognized college would count for\n\npromotion to the post of Head of the Department.\n\n For the reasons aforementioned this petition succeeds and the\n\nsame is allowed. The order of promotion issued in favour of respondent no.\n\n3 on 22.12.2008 ( R.2) is set aside.
