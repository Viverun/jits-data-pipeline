The\norder terminating his services, was preceded by a show-cause\nnotice of proposed disciplinary action against him, but\notherwise, there was nothing to show that the service record\nof Belliappa was, in any way, inferior to his three juniors\nwho have been retained in service. Furthermore, neither the\ndismissal order nor the appellant's counter affidavit\nassigned any reason for the termination and the appellant\nhad throughout maintained that there was no nexus between\nthe show-cause notice and the impugned action. The High\nCourt allowed a writ petition of Belliappa, holding that the\norder terminating his services, contravened the guarantee of\nequal treatment embodied in\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution.\nIt was contended that Belliappa was a temporary\nemployee, and his services could be terminated at any time\nwithout notice, and that\nArticles 14\nand\nare J not\nattracted when the services of a temporary employee are\nterminated in accordance with the conditions of his service.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court\n^\nHELD: 1. The protection of\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\nwill\nbe available even to a temporary Government servant if he\nhas been arbitrarily discriminated against and singled out\nfor harsh treatment in preference to his juniors similarly\ncircumstanced. The competent authority may have a discretion\nunder the conditions of service governing the employee, to\nterminate his services without notice, but such discretion\nhas to be exercised in accordance with reason and fair play,\nand not capriciously. Arbitrary invocation or enforcement of\na service condition terminating the service of a temporary\nemployee, may itself constitute denial of equal protection\nand offend the Equality clause in\nArticles 14\nand\n16(l\n).\n[464B-E]\nDoddaiah v.

Excepting perhaps, in cases analogous to\nthose covered by\nArt. 311(2)\nproviso (c), the authority\ncannot withhold such information from the court on the\nexcuse, that the impugned order is purely administrative and\nnot judicial, having been passed in exercise of its\nadministrative discretion under the rules governing the\nconditions of the service.

Veerappa and J. R. Das for the Appellant.\n\nR. B. Datar, P. R. Ramasesh and Lalit Bhargava for the\nRespondent.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by G\nSARKARIA, J.-The respondent, Belliappa, was appointed\ntemporary Junior Compositor in the Grade of RS. 65-1-72-2-90\nin the Government Branch Press, Mercara. The post was non-\ngazetted Class IV as defined in Clause (IV) of Sub-Rule 3 of\nRule 5 of the Mysore Civil Services (Classification Control\nand Appeal) Rules, H 1957. The employment was temporary and\nwas to continue until further orders.\nThe Branch Manager, Mercara, Respondent 1 (herein),\nserved a notice on the respondent on December 29, 1966,\nstating that the respondent had taken outside the Press some\ncopies of the ballot papers relating to the Director's\nelection of Coorg Cardamom Cooperative Societies, Mercara.\nThe respondent was required to show cause before 2.00 P.M.\nOf December 30, 1966, why disciplinary 8 action be not taken\nagainst him as per Rules. It was further stated in the\nnotice that failure to comply with the notice will result in\nthe respondent's suspension and further disciplinary action\nagainst him.\n\nThereafter on January 3, 1967, an order was served on\nthe respondent, terminating his service. This order\n(hereinafter called the impugned order) runs as under:\n\n\"Office of the Manager, Government Branch Press,\nMercara.\n\nMemoranda\nAs per instructions contained in Head Office Order\nNo. 570/66-67, dated 3-1-1967, Sri D. B. Belliappa,\nJunior Compositor of this Office is hereby informed\nthat your appointment is purely temporary and\nterminable at any time without any previous notice and\nwithout reasons being assigned therefore are not\nrequired. Therefore your services are hereby\nterminated with immediate effect.\n\nSd/- xxx\nGovernment Branch Press, Mercara.\"\n\nOn January 7, 1967, Belliappa submitted a\nrepresentation, dated January 6, 1967, to the Branch Manager\nagainst termination of his service, but without success,\nattributing motives to his immediate superior officer, that\nhis relations with the Respondent were not cordial for the\npreceding three months. He also prayed for permission to\ncontinue to work and requested for disbursement of his pay.\n\nOn February 4, 1967, Belliappa instituted a writ\npetition in the High Court of Mysore with a prayer to quash\nthe order terminating his service. He further prayed for a\ndirection that the Manager of the Press (appellant) be\ndirected to appoint him a regular candidate to the post of\nthe Junior Compositor in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Mysore State Civil Services (Recruitment of Local\nCandidates to Class III) Rules, 1966, with consequential\nbenefits.\nThe Manager filed a counter-affidavit stating that the\nrespondent's appointment was purely temporary governed by\nthe conditions in the contract of his service, and was\nliable to be terminated without notice at any time; that the\n1966 Rules relied upon by the writ petitioner were not\napplicable to him because he was a Class IV Employee.\n\nSubsequently, Belliappa filed a further affidavit\nurging additional grounds for impugning the order of his\ndischarge. The High Court, by its Order dated January 30,\n1968, allowed the respondent to take up these additional\ngrounds, to the effect that three other persons, namely,\nS/Shri B. S. Vittala, N. B. Achiah and Patric D' Souza who\nare appointed as temporary Junior Compositors subsequent to\nthe a respondent's appointment, had been retained and\ncontinued in service, while a discriminatory treatment was\nmeted out to the respondent, without any reason. It was\nurged that in these circumstances, the termination of the\nrespondent's service, while continuing three others,\nsimilarly situated, was violative of\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution. At the stage of arguments, the respondent gave\nup his claim for regularisation of service.\n\nThe High Court by its order dated June 20, 1968,\nallowed the writ petition, holding that the impugned order\ncontravened the guarantee of equal treatment embodied in\nArticle 16. the High Court did not give reasons in this\norder, but stated therein that the reasons given in the\ndecision of that Court in Writ Petition No. 153 of 1965,\nwere applicable. In the result, the impugned order, by which\nthe respondent's services were terminated, was set aside and\nit was declared that he will be entitled to all the benefits\nflowing from the court's order, including reinstatement and\nthe like.\n\nHence. this appeal by special leave.\n\nMr. Veerappa, learned counsel for the appellant,\ncontends that the respondent, Belliappa, was appointed in a\ntemporary capacity and his service could be terminated at\nany time without notice. The proposition propounded is that\n\nArticles 14\nand\nare not attracted in a case where the\nservices of a temporary employee are terminated in\naccordance with the conditions of his service. In the\nalternative, it is submitted that the principle of 'first\ncome and last go' may apply only when there is a general\nretrenchment and not where there is some special reason for\nterminating the services of one employee while continuing\nhis juniors in the temporary service. It is maintained that\nthe show-cause notice which was served on the respondent on\nDecember 29, 1966, furnishes the motive or the cause for\nterminating the\nrespondent's services, while retaining his juniors in\nservice. Mr. Veerappa contends that in spite of the fact\nthat the position taken by the appellants in the impugned\norder was that the service of the respondent was being\nterminated without assigning any reason in accordance with\nthe conditions of his service, it could be spelled out from\nthe show-cause notice that the real cause of terminating the\nrespondent's service was his unsuitability for the job or\nunsatisfactory conduct.\n\nA number of decisions have been cited:\nThe Union of\nIndia v. Pandurang Kashinath More\n(\n1), Champaklal Chimanlal\nShah v. the Union of India\n(\n2), Doddaiah v. State of\nMysore\n(3) Union of India v. Prem Parkash Midha(4);\nState of\nU.P. v. Ram Chandra Trivedi\n(5);\nMadan Singh Puran Singh v.\nThe Union of India\n.(6).\n\nAs against this, it is submitted on behalf of the\nrespondent that in his further affidavit, dated January 25,\n1968, the respondent had taken up the plea of hostile\ndiscrimination, with particularity, stating that while his\nthree named juniors who were in all respects similarly\nsituated, were continued in service; the respondent was\narbitrarily singled cut for discriminatory treatment,\nalthough the respondent's record of service was good and at\nno time he gave room for any complaint from his official\nsuperiors. It is stressed that these averments in the\nadditional affidavit of the respondent were not rebutted or\ncountered by the opposite side on affidavit, nor was any\nmaterial produced on record to show that there was any\nspecial reason for terminating the respondent's service, and\ncontinuing the service of his juniors. It is urged that\nsince the consistent stand taken by the appellant in the\nimpugned order, in their counter-affidavit and at the time\nof arguments in the High Court was that the service of the\nrespondent has been terminated without any reason, in\naccordance with the terms and conditions of his service? the\nappellants should not be allowed to commit a volt face in\nthis special appeal and take up a different ground which was\nnever set up or pleaded.\n\nBefore dealing with the contentions canvassed on both\nsides, it will be useful to notice the relevant undisputed\nfacts for the discussion emerging from the pleadings and the\nmaterial on record.\n\n(1) A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 630.\n\n(2) [1964] 5 S.C.R. 190.\n\n(3) A.I.R. 1967 Mysore 223.\n\n(4) [1965] 69 S.L.R. 655 (S.C.)\n(5) [1977] I S.C.R. 462.\n\n(6) 1972 S.L.R. 67 (Delhi).\nThe service of the respondent, Belliappa, has been\nterminated without assigning any reason albeit in\naccordance with the conditions of his service, while three\nemployees, similarly situated, junior to Belliappa in the\nsame temporary cadre have been retained.\n\nA charge of hostile discrimination has been levelled\nwith sufficient particularity against the appellant. Hostile\nanimus was also attributed by Belliappa in his writ petition\nto his superior officers. In the additional grounds of his\nfurther affidavit, Belliappa averred that his service record\nwas good. This fact has not been controverted by the\nappellant by filing any counter-affidavit. However, there is\nmaterial on the record to show that the impugned order was\npreceded by a show-cause notice of proposed disciplinary\naction against Belliappa. It could, therefore, be presumed\nthat but for this show-cause notice, the service record of\nBelliappa was good. At any rate, there is nothing on the\nrecord to show that the service record of Belliappa was, m\nany way, inferior to his three juniors who have been\nretained in service. The impugned order itself says that\nBelliappa's services are being terminated without assigning\nany reason, and the same has been reiterated in the counter-\naffidavit, dated September 22, 1967, filed on behalf of the\npresent appellant in the High Court.\n\nIn order to satisfy our conscience and appreciate the\narguments of Mr. Veerappa that the services of the\nrespondent have been terminated on the ground of\nunsuitability, we requested him to cause the production of\nthe Head Office Order No. 570/66-67 dated January 3, 1967,\nwhich has been referred to in the impugned order. We granted\nMr. Veerappa sufficient time for this purpose. On a\nsubsequent date, he informed us that this Head Office order\nalso does not contain any reason for the impugned action.\nIndeed, the contents of this Head Office order have been\nsubstantially reiterated in the impugned order, according to\nwhich, the service of Belliappa was terminated Of course,\nthere is always some reason or cause for terminating the\nservices of a temporary employee. It is not necessary to\nstate that reason in the order of termination communicated\nto the employee concerned. But where there is a specific\ncharge of arbitrary discrimination or some hostile motive is\nimputed to the authority terminating the service, it is\nincumbent on the authority making the impugned order to\nexplain the same by disclosing the reason for the impugned\naction. In the instant case, the appellant intransigently\nwithheld that information from the Court. There is no escape\nfrom the conclusion that Belliappa was picked out for the\nimpugned action, whimsically, without any special reason\nwhich could put him in a class separate from that of his\nthree juniors who have been retained in service.\nThe ground is now clear for considering the contentions\ncanvassed by the appellant.\n\nMr. Veerappa's first contention is that\nArticles 14\nand\n\n16(1)\nof the Constitution have no application, whatever, to\nthe case of a temporary employee whose service is terminated\nin accordance with the terms and conditions of his service\nbecause the tenure or the duration of the employment of such\nan employee is extremely precarious being dependent upon the\npleasure and discretion of the employer-State. In our\nopinion, no such generalisation can be made. The protection\nof\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\nwill be available even to such a\ntemporary Government servant if he has been arbitrarily\ndiscriminated against and singled out for harsh treatment in\npreference to his juniors similarly circumstanced. It is\ntrue that the competent authority had a discretion under the\nconditions of service governing the employee concerned to\nterminate the latter's employment without notice. But, such\ndiscretion has to be exercised in accordance with reason and\nfair play and not capriciously. Bereft of rationality and\nfairness, discretion degenerates into arbitrariness which is\nthe very anti-thesis of the rule of law on which our\ndemocratic polity is founded. Arbitrary invocation or\nenforcement of a service condition terminating the service\nof a temporary employee may itself constitute denial of\nequal protection and offend the Equality clause in\nArticle\nand\n16(1).\n\nArticle 16(1)\nguarantees \"equality of\nopportunity for all citizens in matters relating to\nemployment or appointment to any office under the State\".\nMoreover, according to the principle underlying\nSection 16\n\nof the General Clauses Act, the expression \"appointment\"\nused in\nArticle 16(1)\nwill include termination of or removal\nfrom service, also.\n\nIt is now well settled that the expression \"matters\nrelating to employment used in\nArticle 16(1)\nis not confined\nto initial matters prior to the act of employment. but\ncomprehends all matters in relation to employment both\nprior, and subsequent, to the employment which are\nincidental to the employment and form part of the terms and\nconditions of such employment, such as, provisions as to\nsalary, increments, leave, gratuity, pension, age of\nsuperannuation, promotion and even termination of\nemployment. It is further well established that\nArticles 14\n,\n15(1)\nand\n16(1)\nfrom part of the same constitutional code of\nguarantees and supplement each other. If my authority is\nneeded for the above enunciation, reference may be made to\nthe observations made by Gajendragadkar J., as he then was,\nin\nGeneral Manager, Southern Railway v. Rangachari\n(1).\n\n(1) [1962] 2 S.C.R. 586.\nIn\nUnion of India v. P. K. More\n(supra), it was\ncontended befor this Court that\nArticle 16\nprovides that\nthere shall be no inequality of treatment in the termination\nof the service of any employee of the Government. This\ninterpretation of the Article was disputed by the Union of\nIndia, who was the appellant\nin that case\n. Although the\nCourt thought it unnecessary to pronounce finally on this\ndispute for the purpose of that case, yet it proceeded an\nthe assumption that\nArticle 16\nmight be violated by an\narbitrary and discriminatory termination of service. In that\ncase, the respondent, P. K. More, had been detained legally\nunder a statute. In view of this fact, the Court held that\n'the respondent might legitimately have been put in a\nseparate class and treated differently from others not so\ndetained.\"\n\nIn the instant case, no special circumstance or reason\nhas been disclosed which would justify discriminatory\ntreatment to Belliappa as a class apart from his juniors who\nhave been retained in service. Mr. Veerappa's frantic\nefforts to spell out justification for differential\ntreatment to the respondent by reference to the show-cause\nnotice that preceded the impugned action, is entirely futile\nwhen the stand tenaciously adhered to throughout by his\nclient is that there is no nexus between the show-cause\nnotice and the impugned action which was taken without any\nreason in exercise of the power vested in the competent\nauthority under the conditions of the respondent's\nemployment.\n\nIn view of this, we have no alternative but to hold\nthat the termination of Belliappa's service was made\narbitrarily and not on the ground of unsuitability or other\nreason, which would warrant discriminatory treatment to him\nas a class apart from others in the same Cadre.\n\nIn the view we take, we are further fortified by a\ndecision of the Constitution Bench in Champak Lal's case\n(supra). That was a case of a temporary Government servant.\nRule S governing a temporary Government servant, which came\nup for consideration\nin that case\n, gave power to the\nGovernment to terminate the service of a temporary\nGovernment servant by giving him one month's notice or on\npayment of one month's pay in lieu of notice. This rule was\nattacked on the ground that it was hit by\nArticle 16.\nIn the\nalternative, it was urged that even if rule 5 is good, the\norder by which the appellant's services were dispensed with,\nwas bad because it was discriminatory. Reference was made to\na number of persons whose services were not dispensed with,\neven though they were junior to the appellant and did not\nhave as good qualifications as he had. Wanchoo J. (as he\nthen was, speaking for the Court, repelled the alternative\nargument in these terms:\n\"We are of opinion that there is no force in this\ncontention. This is not a case where services of a\ntemporary employee are being retrenched because of the\nabolition of a post. In such a case, a question may\narise as to who should be retrenched when one out of\nseveral temporary post is being retrenched in an\noffice. In those circumstances, qualifications and\nlength of service of those holding similar temporary\nposts may be relevant in considering whether the\nretrenchment of a particular employee was as a result\nof discrimination. The present however is a case where\nthe appellant's services were terminated because his\nwork was found to be unsatisfactory.. (In such a case\nthere can, in our opinion, be no question of any\ndiscrimination. It would be absurd to say that if the\nservice of one temporary servant is terminated on the\nground of unsatisfactory conduct the services of all\nsimilar employees must also be terminated along with\nhim, irrespective of what their conduct is. Therefore\neven though some of those mentioned in the plaint by\nthe appellant were junior to him and did not have as\ngood qualifications as he had and were retained in\nservice, it does not follow that the action taken\nagainst the appellant terminating his services was\ndiscriminatory, for that action was taken on the basis\nof his unsatisfactory conduct. A question of\ndiscrimination may arise in a case of retrenchment on\naccount of abolition of one of several temporary posts\nof the same kind in one office but can in our opinion\nnever arise in the case of dispensing with the services\nof a particular temporary employee on account of his\nconduct being unsatisfactory.\"\n\n(Parenthesis and emphasis supplied)\nThe principle that can be deduced from the above analysis is\nthat if the services of a temporary Government servant are\nterminated in accordance with the conditions of his service\non the ground of unsatisfactory conduct or his unsuitability\nfor the job and/or for his work; being unsatisfactory, or\nfor a like reason which marks him off in a class apart from\nother temporary servants who have been retained in service,\nthere is no question of the applicability of\nArticle 16.\n\nConversely, if the services of a temporary Government\nservant are terminated, arbitrarily, and not on the ground\nof his unsuitability, unsatisfactory conduct or the like\nwhich would put him in a class apart from his juniors in the\nsame service, a question of unfair discrimination may arise,\nnotwithstanding the fact that in terminating his service,\nthe appointing authority was purporting to act in accordance\nwith the terms of the employment. Where a charge of unfair\ndiscrimination is levelled with specificity, or improper\nmotives are imputed to the authority making the impugned\norder of termination of 11 the service, it is the duty of\nthe authority to dispell that charge by disclosing to the\nCourt the reason or motive which impelled it to take the\nimpugned action. Excepting, perhaps, in cases analogous to\nthose covered by\nArticle 311(2)\n, Proviso (c), the authority\ncannot withhold such information from the Court on the lame\nexcuse, that the impugned order is purely administrative and\nnot judicial, having been passed in exercise of its\nadministrative discretion under the rules governing the\nconditions of the service. \"The giving of reasons\", as Lord\nDenning put it in Green v. Amalgamated Engineering Union(1).\n\n\"is one of the fundamentals of good administration\", and, to\nrecall the words of this Court in\nKhudi Ram v. State of West\nBengal\n(2) in a Government of laws \"there is nothing like\nunfettered discretion immune from judicial review ability\".\n\nThe executive, no less than the judiciary, is under a\ngeneral duty to act fairly. Indeed, fairness founded on\nreason is the essence of the guarantee epitomised in\n\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1).\n\nAnother facet of Mr. Veerappa's contention is that the\nrespondent had voluntarily entered into a contract of\nservice on the terms of employment offered to him. One of\nthe terms of that contract, embodied in tile letter of his\nappointment is that his service was purely temporary and was\nliable to termination at the will and pleasure of the\nappointing authority, without reason and without notice.\nHaving willingly accepted the employment on terms offered to\nhim, the respondent cannot complain against the impugned\naction taken in accordance with those mutually agreed terms.\n\nThe argument is wholly misconceived. It is borrowed\nfrom the archaic common law concept that employment was a\nmatter between the master and servant only. In the first\nplace, this rule in its original absolute form is not\napplicable to Government servant. Secondly, even with regard\nto private employment, much of it has passed into the\nfossils of time. \"This rule held the field at the time when\nthe master and servant were taken more literally than they\nare now and when, as in early Roman Law, the rights of the\nservant, like the rights of any other member of the\nhousehold, were not his own, but those of his pater\nfamilias\". The overtones of this ancient doctrine are\ndiscernible in the Anglo-American jurisprudence of the 18th\ncentury and the first half of the 20th century, which\nrationalised the\n(1) [1971] 1 All E.R. at p.114.\n\n(2) [1975] (2) S.C.R. 832 at page 845.\nemployer's absolute right to discharge the employee. \"Such a\nphilosophy\", as pointed out by K. K. Mathew J. (vide his\ntreatise: \"Democracy, Equality and Freedom\", page 326), \"of\nthe employer's dominion over his employee may have been in\ntune with the rustic simplicity of bygone days. But that\nphilosophy is incompatible with these days of large,\nimpersonal, corporate employers.\" To bring it in tune with\nvastly changed and changing socio-economic conditions and\nmores of the day, much of this old antiquated and unjust\ndoctrine has been eroded by judicial decisions and\nlegislation, particularly in its application to persons in\npublic employment, to whom the Constitutional protection of\n\nArticles 14\n, 15\n, 16\nand\nis available. The argument is\ntherefore overruled.\n\nComing back to the point, we have a vague feeling that\nit was, perhaps, open to the appellant to say in view of the\ncomplaint alluded to in the snow-cause notice against the\nintegrity and fidelity of the respondent, that the former\nhad lost confidence in the latter and considered him\nunsuitable to be continued in the post which was one of\ntrust and confidence. But it will be hazardous for us to\nbase our decision on any such speculation, when the\nappellant, himself, instead of taking any such plea, has,\nwith obdurate persistency stuck to the position that the\nrespondent's service has been terminated without any reason,\nwhich comes perilously near to admitting that the power\nreserved to the employer under the conditions of the\nemployment, has been exercised arbitrarily.\n\nIn the absence of any information from the appellant\nindicating that the respondent was marked off for discharge\non the basis of an intelligible differentia having a\nreasonable nexus with the object of maintaining the\nefficiency and integrity of the public service, we are\nconstrained to hold, in agreement with the High Court, that\nthe impugned order suffers from the vice of unfair\ndiscrimination and is violative of\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\nof\nthe Constitution. Accordingly, we uphold the decision of the\nHigh Court and dismiss this appeal with costs.\n\nM.R. Appeal dismissed.",

HEADNOTE: THE SERVICES OF BELLIAPPA, A TEMPORARY CLASS IV EMPLOYEE, WERE TERMINATED WITHOUT ASSIGNING ANY REASON, ALBEIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS OF HIS SERVICE, WHILE THREE OTHER EMPLOYEES, SIMILARLY SITUATED, JUNIOR TO BALLIAPPA IN THE SAME TEMPORARY CADRE, WERE RETAINED. THE ORDER TERMINATING HIS SERVICES, WAS PRECEDED BY A SHOW-CAUSE NOTICE OF PROPOSED DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST HIM, BUT OTHERWISE, THERE WAS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT THE SERVICE RECORD OF BELLIAPPA WAS, IN ANY WAY, INFERIOR TO HIS THREE JUNIORS WHO HAVE BEEN RETAINED IN SERVICE. FURTHERMORE, NEITHER THE DISMISSAL ORDER NOR THE APPELLANT'S COUNTER AFFIDAVIT ASSIGNED ANY REASON FOR THE TERMINATION AND THE APPELLANT HAD THROUGHOUT MAINTAINED THAT THERE WAS NO NEXUS BETWEEN THE SHOW-CAUSE NOTICE AND THE IMPUGNED ACTION. THE HIGH COURT ALLOWED A WRIT PETITION OF BELLIAPPA, HOLDING THAT THE ORDER TERMINATING HIS SERVICES, CONTRAVENED THE GUARANTEE OF EQUAL TREATMENT EMBODIED IN ARTICLE 16 OF THE CONSTITUTION. IT WAS CONTENDED THAT BELLIAPPA WAS A TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE, AND HIS SERVICES COULD BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE, AND THAT ARTICLES 14 AND ARE J NOT ATTRACTED WHEN THE SERVICES OF A TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE ARE TERMINATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS OF HIS SERVICE. DISMISSING THE APPEAL, THE COURT ^ HELD: 1. THE PROTECTION OF ARTICLES 14 AND 16(1) WILL BE AVAILABLE EVEN TO A TEMPORARY GOVERNMENT SERVANT IF HE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND SINGLED OUT FOR HARSH TREATMENT IN PREFERENCE TO HIS JUNIORS SIMILARLY CIRCUMSTANCED. THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY MAY HAVE A DISCRETION UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF SERVICE GOVERNING THE EMPLOYEE, TO TERMINATE HIS SERVICES WITHOUT NOTICE, BUT SUCH DISCRETION HAS TO BE EXERCISED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REASON AND FAIR PLAY, AND NOT CAPRICIOUSLY.
