Plaintiff claiming to be a cooperative society\n\nregistered under the \nGujarat Cooperative Housing\n\nSocieties Act\n sought for a decree of specific performance\n\nbeing passed in its favour contending inter alia that\n\nproperty bearing Survey Nos.37 and 39 situated at village\n\n Page 3 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nThaltej, Taluka Daskroi, District Ahmedabad,\n\nadmeasuring 2-Acres and 29-Gunthas and 4-Acres and 38-\n\nGunthas respectively belonged to first defendant which is\n\na trust registered under the \nBombay Public Trusts Act\n\n(for short, '\nBPT Act\n') and defendant Nos.2 to 8 are its\n\ntrustees. It was further contended that defendants had\n\nexecuted an Agreement for Sale dated 18.08.1966 in\n\nfavour of Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and Ambalal\n\nIshvarlal Prajapati. Said Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh as\n\nwell as the Trust executed an Agreement of Sale dated\n\n21.09.1970 in favour of Gangaram Bhaskarrao Pavde.\n\nSaid Gangaram Bhaskarrao Pavde assigned his rights in\n\nfavour of a partnership firm M/s.Jalpa Traders through its\n\npartner Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah. One of the trustees\n\nMr.Kunjbiharilal Madhavlal Bhagwat is said to have\n\nexecuted an Agreement to Sell dated 08.05.1972 in\n\nfavour of the partnership firm Jalpa Traders through its\n\npartner Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah and he had also\n\npreviously executed an Agreement dated 03.04.1972.

The said rights of\n\nAgreement of Sale which was acquired by Jalpa Traders\n\ncame to be assigned by the said firm through its partners\n\nin favour of M/s.Chhaganlal and Company vide\n\nAgreement to Sell dated 23.11.1973, who entered into an\n\nAgreement of Sale in favour of the plaintiff society to sell\n\nthe land under the Agreement of Sale dated 27.12.1974,\n\nunder which agreement plaintiff society is said to have\n\npaid a sum of Rs.15,000/- to M/s.Chhaganlal and\n\nCompany. Plaintiff also claimed that a sum of Rs.25,000/-\n\nis paid on 20.05.1975 and Rs.5,000/- on 15.12.1978 and\n\nin all Rs.45,000/- was paid to said Chhaganlal &\n\nCompany. Plaintiff claimed that all trustees of the\n\ndefendant trust have agreed to continue the Agreement\n\nof Sale dated 27.12.1974 executed by M/s.Chhaganlal and\n\nCompany and at the first instance, the agreed price was\n\nRs.3.25 per sq.meter and it was agreed to be revised\n\nupwards by Rs.2 per sq.meter totaling to Rs.5.25 per\n\nsq.meter. It is also contended that while assigning all\n\nrights over the said land in favour of the plaintiff society\n\n Page 5 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nby the defendants, all the defendants have executed their\n\nwritings over the Agreement to Sell dated 27.12.1974 and\n\non 18.04.1976 vacant and peaceful possession of the land\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'suit schedule property')\n\nagreed to be sold in favour of plaintiff society was handed\n\nover to the plaintiff.\n\n4. It is further contended by the plaintiff that\n\ndefendant trust had received a sum of Rs.20,001/-\n\ntowards consideration by Cheque dated 21.10.1982 which\n\nhas been duly accepted that it was in lieu of Cheque\n\ndated 11.08.1982 owing to certain mistake in the said\n\ncheque. It is also contended that further sum of\n\nRs.5,500/- was paid towards sale consideration on\n\n30.12.1982 and a sum of Rs.5,000/- paid on 04.06.1983 by\n\ncheque drawn on Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank.\n\nThus, plaintiff society claimed that in all it had paid\n\nRs.30,501/- to the defendant trust.\n\n5. Plaintiff also claimed that one Shri Babaji\n\nBapuji had been as appointed on 01.10.1976 as\n\n Page 6 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nWatchman for the suit schedule property after obtaining\n\npossession and a sum of Rs.4,800/- was paid to him by\n\nChhaganlal and Company and same had been refunded by\n\nplaintiff to Chhaganlal and Company. Plaintiff als claimed\n\na sum of Rs.4,800/- was paid on 25.09.1978 and on\n\n16.12.1978, further sum of Rs.4,800/-, Rs.5,300/- on\n\n10.06.1980 and Rs.5,300/- on 17.06.1981. Thus, in all a\n\nsum of Rs.25,000/- was claimed to have been paid to the\n\nsaid Babaji Bapuji by the plaintiff society. It is further\n\ncontended that plaintiff society appointed Shri\n\nJagbahadur Lagbadahur Thapa as Watchman on monthly\n\nsalary and presently Rs.400/- is paid to him towards his\n\nsalary. It is contended that a room has been constructed\n\nfor the residence of said watchman and as such, plaintiff\n\nclaimed to be in possession of the suit schedule property.\n\n6. Plaintiff has contended that it was desirous of\n\nconstructing houses for its members and as such had got\n\na layout plan drawn by the Engineer which plan was also\n\nduly signed by the trustees. Plaintiff has contended that\n\ndefendant trust had also filed an application before the\n\n Page 7 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nCharity Commissioner seeking permission to sell the suit\n\nland as required under \nSection 36\n of the BPT Act. Plaintiff\n\nalso contended that defendants have filed Form No.1 at\n\nGandhinagar as per \nSection 20\n of the Urban Land\n\n(Ceiling and Regulation) Act seeking exemption from the\n\nprovisions of said law wherein it is specifically mentioned\n\nthat defendant has proposed to sell the suit land to the\n\nplaintiff.\n\n7. Contending that defendant No.1 trust was\n\nattempting to dispose of the suit land to someone else\n\nowing to price escalation and there is likelihood of\n\nplaintiff being disturbed of possession and despite being\n\ntold by the plaintiff to execute the sale, said demand is\n\nnot being complied by defendant and as such, plaintiff\n\ninitially instituted a Civil Suit No.210 of 1983 for\n\nperpetual injunction which was withdrawn with\n\npermission on 17.07.1984 and the present suit was filed\n\non the same day i.e. on 17.07.1984 seeking for specific\n\nperformance of the Agreement of Sale dated 27.12.1984.\n\n Page 8 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n8. On service of suit summons, defendant Nos.1 to\n\n4 and 6 appeared and filed their written statement\n\ndenying the averments made in the plaint except to the\n\nextent expressly admitted thereunder. It was contended\n\nthat similar suit had been filed earlier and it has been\n\nwithdrawn and therefore the present suit was barred by\n\nres judicata. It was also contended that present suit was\n\nbarred by limitation. It was specifically contended that\n\nsuit is not maintainable as per \nSection 51\n of BPT Act\n\nsince written permission from the Charity Commissioner\n\nfor filing of the suit was not obtained and on this ground\n\nsuit was liable to be dismissed. It was also contended that\n\nCharity Commissioner is a necessary and proper party to\n\nthe suit as contemplated under \nSection 51(3)\n of the BPT\n\nAct and for non-joining of necessary party, the suit is\n\nliable to be dismissed. Contending that under \nSection 80\n\nof the BPT Act, the Civil Court does not have jurisdiction\n\nto hear and adjudicate the suit, defendants sought for its\n\ndismissal.\n\n9. It was also contended that defendants had\n\n Page 9 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nentered into Banakhat - Agreement to Sell the sit land to\n\nPramukhlal and Ambalal but later on the trust and\n\nPramukhlal made another Banakhat - Agreement to Sell\n\nin favour of Gangaram Pavde which agreement was not\n\nduly signed by all the trustees. It was further contended\n\nthat in the earlier Agreement to Sell entered into by the\n\ntrust with Pramukhal and Ambalal, it did not contain the\n\nsignature of Ambalal and as such, the said Banakhat -\n\nAgreement to Sell was pleaded to be not legal. Denying\n\nthe fact that Gangaram Pavde had transferred his\n\nBanakhat rights to third party, the plaintiff has been put\n\nto strict proof of the same. It is further contended that\n\nfrom amongst the trustees of the first defendant trust,\n\none of the trustees on advise of the plaintiff had entered\n\ninto Agreement to Sell in favour of Mukundbhai on behalf\n\nof Jalpa Traders on 08.05.1972. This Agreement to Sell\n\nwas signed by Mr.Kunjbihari who had not been\n\nauthorized by all the trustees to enter into such\n\nagreement. Hence, contending that trust is not\n\nresponsible or answerable for such transaction and\n\n Page 10 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndenying that Kunjbihari being the Managing Trustee of\n\nthe trust or having any such unilateral power to enter\n\ninto Agreement of Sale, they have denied said agreement.\n\nThe agreement dated 03.04.1972 was also pleaded not to\n\nbe in the knowledge or not being in the knowledge of\n\ndefendants and plaintiff was put to strict proof of the\n\nsame. The right of Jalpa Traders transferring their\n\nBanakhat rights, defendants pleaded their lack of\n\npersonal knowledge as also the right of Chhaganlal and\n\nCompany transferring their Banakhat rights in favour of\n\nthe plaintiff. The contention raised by the plaintiff in the\n\nplaint in this behalf has been denied and plaintiff has\n\nbeen put to strict proof of the same. The fact of\n\npossession having been delivered to the plaintiff by the\n\ntrustees is also denied. The execution of the document\n\nwith regard to possession of the suit schedule property\n\nhaving been delivered to the plaintiff is also denied by the\n\ndefendants. It was contended that one Mr.Anubhai\n\nPremchand was claiming to be the tenant and the dispute\n\nin this regard was pending before the Revenue Tribunal.\n\n Page 11 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nThe Banakhat - Agreement to Sell between Chhaganlal\n\nand Company and M/s.Jalpa Traders on 13.11.1973 about\n\ndelivery of vacant possession is denied. It was specifically\n\ndenied that plaintiff was put in possession of the suit\n\nlands.\n\n10. Plaintiff was put to strict proof with regard to\n\naffixure of signature of defendants with regard to layout\n\nplan. However, defendants admitted to have made an\n\napplication before the Charity Commissioner for selling\n\nthe suit land and filing the form before the ULC\n\nauthorities.\n\n11. It is also contended that defendant is a public\n\ntrust registered under \nBPT Act\n and without obtaining\n\npermission to sell, the suit schedule property cannot be\n\nsold to any private person and this fact is well within the\n\nknowledge of the plaintiff. Hence, the alleged delivery of\n\npossession of suit schedule property in favour of plaintiff\n\ncame to be denied. It was contended that suit land is in\n\npossession of the tenants and case was pending before\n\n Page 12 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthe Revenue Tribunal. Hence, it was contended that\n\nplaintiff was not in possession of the suit land.\n\n12. The defendants denied the plaintiff's claim of\n\nhaving made any oral demand for executing the sale and\n\ncontended that there is no direct contact between the\n\nplaintiff and defendants to sell the suit schedule land.\n\nContending that the trust cannot sell the land to the\n\nplaintiff, as it does not have permission and defendants\n\nare also not bound to sell the suit schedule land. It was\n\nspecifically contended that all the trustees have not\n\naffixed their signatures and there is no legal contract\n\nbetween plaintiff and defendants qua the suit land. On\n\nthese grounds amongst others pleaded in the written\n\nstatement, they sought for dismissal of the suit.\n\nDefendant No.5 and 15 have filed their written\n\nstatements as per Exhibits-54 and 126 respectively.\n\nSubsequently, 15th defendant was ordered to be deleted\n\nand accordingly 1st defendant has been deleted. The\n\nCharity Commissioner has not filed any reply. No other\n\ndefendants have filed their written statement. Hence,\n\n Page 13 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nbased on the pleadings of the parties, the learned Trial\n\nJudge framed ten (10) issues for determination. Learned\n\nTrial Judge has answered issue No.1 in the affirmative\n\nand issue Nos.2, 8(a), 9 and 10 partly affirmative. Issue\n\nNos.3 to 8 in the negative.\n\n13. In order to substantiate the averments made in\n\nthe plaint, one Shri Babulal got himself examined as only\n\nwitness on behalf of the plaintiff. His deposition has been\n\nmarked as Exhibit-49. No witnesses were examined on\n\nbehalf of plaintiffs. On appreciation of oral and\n\ndocumentary evidence, learned trial Judge by judgment\n\nand decree dated 23.10.2000 partly decreed the suit and\n\ndirected defendant Nos.1 to 8 and defendant No.14 to\n\nrefund sum of Rs.25,000/- plus Rs.40,000/- to the plaintiff\n\nwith interest at 12% per annum from the date of receipt\n\nof judgment and dismissed the prayer for specific\n\nperformance. The relief of perpetual injunction sought for\n\nhas been rejected and the interim order which had been\n\ngranted on Exhibit-5 application came to be revoked.\n\nHence, this appeal.\n\n Page 14 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n14. We have heard the arguments of Shri Yatin\n\nOza, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant\n\nand Shriyuths Shalin Mehta, Mehul S. Shah and Devang\n\nNanavati, learned Senior Advocates alongwith Shriyuths\n\nBrijesh Trivedi, N.M.Kapadia and B.M.Mangukiya,\n\nlearned advocates for contesting respondents.\n\n14.1 It is the contention of Mr. Yatin Oza, learned\n\nSenior Advocate appearing for the appellant that Trial\n\nCourt had committed a serious error in not considering\n\nthe pleadings in proper perspective. He would contend\n\nthat learned Trial Judge ought to have appreciated the\n\nfact that none of the defendants had tendered any oral\n\nevidence in support of their pleadings and as such the\n\nsuit ought to have been decreed as prayed for. He would\n\ncontend that trial judge erred in arriving at a conclusion\n\nthat there is no existence of agreement of sale in favour\n\nof the appellant warranting a decree of specific\n\nperformance by completely ignoring the fact that Trial\n\nCourt itself has accepted that plaintiff had proved that\n\n Page 15 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\npart of sale consideration had been paid by the plaintiff to\n\ndefendant No.1 trust which would itself indicate the\n\nexistence of an agreement of sale.\n\n14.2 He would also contend that if there had been\n\nno intention on the part of the appellant and respondent\n\nNo.1 trust to act upon the said agreement of sale, no\n\nsteps could have been taken by defendant No.1 as well as\n\nby the appellant and the very fact that requisite\n\npermission from the concerned authorities having been\n\nfiled not being in dispute was itself sufficient to arrive at\n\na conclusion that there was existence of an agreement of\n\nsale and there was no intention on the part of plaintiff\n\nand defendant No.1 not to act upon said agreement.\n\n14.3 He would also contend that in part performance\n\nof the agreement of sale, possession of the suit land had\n\nbeen handed over to the plaintiff and as such defendant\n\nNo.1 is precluded from taking contrary stand in this\n\nAppeal. He would submit that oral testimony of the\n\nplaintiff's witness would get support from the\n\n Page 16 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndocumentary evidence tendered and same has been\n\ncompletely ignored by the Trial Court and the ones which\n\nhave been considered is not accepted without any reasons\n\nbeing assigned and as such there is no justification for\n\nthe learned Trial Judge to have arrived at a conclusion\n\nthat plaintiff was not in possession of the suit schedule\n\nproperty.\n\n14.4 He would elaborate his submissions by\n\ncontending that learned Trial Judge erred in arriving at a\n\nconclusion that agreement of sale Exhibit 194 through\n\nwhich the interest possessed by Chhaganlal & Company\n\nwas transferred to plaintiff was not having signatures of\n\nall the trustees of respondent No.1 trust would be of no\n\nconsequence since way back in the year 1978, i.e. on\n\n11.11.1978, a resolution had been passed by trust which\n\nconclusively disclosed that defendant No.1 had consented\n\nto the sale transaction in favour of Chhaganlal &\n\nCompany and thereafter in favour of the appellant,\n\nsubject to permission being obtained from the Charity\n\nCommissioner and as such any stand taken contrary to\n\n Page 17 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthe same either by defendant No.1 or by other trustees is\n\nof no consequence.\n\n14.5 He would contend that had it been the case of\n\nthe appellant not being ready and willing, it would not\n\nhave affected the payment of part consideration and\n\nplaintiff would not have moved the authorities for\n\nobtaining various permissions under provisions of various\n\nstatutes, nor would it have deployed its watchman for the\n\npurpose of maintaining the suit land. He would also\n\ncontend that the provisions of \nSections 50\n and \n51\n of the\n\nGujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951 would not be attracted to\n\nthe facts on hand as defendant No.1 trust is not a public\n\ntrust. He would also contend that provision contained\n\nunder \nSection 36A\n of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951\n\nis applicable only to transfer by way of sale, mortgage or\n\nrelease and not to a transaction of agreement of sale\n\nwhich is distinct and different from that of transaction of\n\nsale. Hence, he contends that question of obtaining prior\n\npermission would not arise. He would also contend that\n\nthe documents produced along with civil applications\n\n Page 18 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nseeking for additional evidence would clearly disclose the\n\nexistence of agreement of sale Exhibit 194 between\n\nplaintiff and defendant No.1 and by referring to various\n\ndocuments produced along with the plaint which though\n\nproduced had not been exhibited but referred to in the\n\ndeposition of plaintiff's witness to contend that all the\n\ntrustees except defendant No.7 had filed application\n\nunder \nSection 36\n of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951\n\nbefore the Charity Commissioner seeking permission to\n\nsell the suit schedule property to the plaintiff which itself\n\nwas sufficient to hold that there was an agreement of sale\n\nexecuted by defendant No.1 in favour of the plaintiff. He\n\nwould draw the attention of the Court to the agreement of\n\nsale marked as Exhibit 194 to contend that pursuant to\n\nthe said agreement executed in favour of plaintiff\n\nexecuted by the said Chhaganlal & Company which had\n\nbeen endorsed by 5 trustees and subsequently ratified on\n\n18.4.1976 by 4 trustees and as such there being a clear\n\nevidence to said effect, there was no impediment for the\n\nTrial Court to have decreed a suit as sought for. He\n\n Page 19 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nwould also contend that as per the said endorsement\n\ndated 18.4.1976 made by defendant No.1 trust and its\n\ntrustees, the possession of the suit schedule property was\n\nhanded over to the plaintiff and in furtherance of the\n\nsame, defendant No.2 on behalf of defendant No.1 trust\n\nhad filed Form No.1 before Urban Land Ceiling Authority\n\nseeking exemption for selling the suit scheduled land. He\n\nwould also draw the attention of the Court to the\n\ndocument dated 28.8.1978 issued by the District\n\nPanchayat whereunder permission had been granted to\n\nthe plaintiff to purchase the suit land. By inviting the\n\nattention of the Court to the order dated 20.10.1978\n\npassed by the Revenue Department rejecting the\n\napplication seeking exemption under \nSections 19\n and \n20\n\nof the Urban Land Ceiling Act, he would contend that\n\nsame would reflect that there was an agreement of sale in\n\nfavour of the plaintiff. He would further contend that\n\ndefendant No.1 trust had passed a resolution on\n\n11.11.1978 resolving to sell the suit land to the plaintiff,\n\nwhich resolution was duly signed by defendant Nos.2 to 4\n\n Page 20 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nand 6 which would evident that there was an agreement\n\nof sale and this when read along with Exhibit 205 to 207\n\nwould clearly evidence the fact of there being an\n\nagreement of sale between plaintiff and defendant.\n\n14.6 He would contend that even assuming and\n\naccepting that only few trustees have signed the\n\nagreement of sale then also appellant would be entitled to\n\nseek specific performance and mere non-execution of the\n\nagreement of sale by other trustees would not render the\n\nagreement of sale invalid. He would contend that when\n\nForm No.1 was filed before the Urban Land Ceiling\n\nAuthority for exemption, same was not objected to by any\n\nother trustee and thus, defendant No.2 was held to be\n\nauthorised to act for and on behalf of other trustees.\n\nInsofar as finding recorded by the Trial Court with regard\n\nto advance money of Rs.45,000/- paid to defendant No.14,\n\nhe would submit that said defendant itself admitted in the\n\nwritten statement filed to the said effect and as such\n\nfinding of the Trial Judge requires to be set aside. He\n\nwould also contend that plaintiff has complied with the\n\n Page 21 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nterms and conditions of the agreement Exhibit 194 and\n\nhas paid Rs.25,001/- to defendant No.1 as per the agreed\n\nterms viz. within 6 months. On account of defendants\n\nhaving not denied this fact, he prays for adverse\n\ninference being drawn against the defendants.\n\n14.7 Insofar as possession of the suit schedule\n\nproperty is concerned, he would submit that even in the\n\napplication filed by the trustees before various statutory\n\nauthorities, they admit that plaintiff was in possession of\n\nthe suit property and even otherwise Trial Judge failed to\n\nconsider the question of possession being immaterial\n\nwhile adjudicating the suit filed for specific performance\n\nof agreement of sale (Exhibit 194).\n\n14.8 He would also contend that permission under\n\nSection 36\n of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act, 1951 not\n\nbeing there on record was the reason for dismissing the\n\nsuit and same is contrary to the principles laid down by\n\nthis Court in AIR 1984 GUJ 145 and the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in 2020 SCC OnLine SC 825. he\n\n Page 22 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nwould contend that even otherwise subsequent\n\napplication can be filed and in view of subsequent law viz.\n\nUrban Land Ceiling Act\n having been repealed, question of\n\nobtaining permission under \nULC Act\n did not arise.\n\n14.9 On the issue of readiness and willingness, he\n\nwould submit that very fact that plaintiff has complied\n\nwith all terms and conditions of the agreement would\n\nindicate its continuous readiness and willingness having\n\nbeen exhibited by the plaintiff. He would contend that\n\nvery fact that appellant has agreed to pay the revised\n\nrates to the trustees; and has paid consideration towards\n\nthe defendant trust as well as defendant No.14 as agreed\n\nto Exhibit 194 is a mirror to the fact that the appellant /\n\nplaintiff has been ready and willing to perform his part of\n\nthe contract. He would also contend that though plaintiff\n\nhas not stated in actual words and stated to the effect\n\nthat he is ready and willing, the very fact that the plaintiff\n\nis ready to pay the balance consideration as stated in the\n\nprayer would suffice for this Court to arrive at a\n\nconclusion that plaintiff has been ready and willing to\n\n Page 23 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nperform his part of the contract. Non-consideration of\n\nthese vital aspects has resulted in miscarriage in\n\nadministration of justice.\n\n14.10 Mr.Yatin Oza, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant would contend that\n\ninterlocutory applications filed for production of\n\nadditional evidence be allowed and the documents\n\nproduced along with the said application be admitted in\n\nevidence. He would also contend that no time limit has\n\nbeen fixed for filing of an application for additional\n\nevidence. He would also contend that some of the\n\ndocuments have come into existence subsequent to the\n\nfiling of the present appeal and as such this Court can\n\ntake note of subsequent events. He would also contend\n\nthat some of the documents which are prior to the filing\n\nof the appeal were not in the custody of the appellant and\n\nappellant had no knowledge as appellant was not a party\n\nin the proceedings held by the Charity Commissioner and\n\nas such these documents could not have been produced\n\nat earlier point of time. He would submit that even\n\n Page 24 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\notherwise for substantial cause the documents can be\n\ntaken on record and some of the documents being public\n\ndocuments, this Court should adopt liberal approach in\n\nreceiving the same by way of additional evidence.\n\n14.11 He would further contend that Explanation-II of\n\nSection 16(c)\n will have no application. He would contend\n\nthat \nSection 114\n of the Gujarat Public Trusts Act which is\n\nanalogous to \nSection 80\n of the Bombay Public Trusts Act\n\nwill have no application inasmuch as no Civil Court has\n\ndecided any issue and as such a conditional decree can be\n\npassed by this Court. He would contend that escalation of\n\nthe price would not be a ground on which plaintiff can be\n\ndenied the relief of specific performance and he would\n\ndraw the attention of the Court to the judgment of\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the matter of \nNirmal Anand Vs.\n\nAdvent Corporation Private Limited\n reported in\n\n(2002) 8 SCC 146. Hence, he has prayed for Appeal\n\nbeing allowed. In support of his submissions, he has\n\nrelied upon following judgments :\n\n \n(1) (2005) 1 SCC 172 - J.P.

He would also contend that\n\nplaintiffs have never demanded defendants for execution\n\nof Sale Deed and would draw the attention of the Court to\n\nparagraph 12 of the written statement filed by defendant\n\nNos.1 to 4 and 6. He would submit that after rejection of\n\nthe application by the Charity Commissioner no steps\n\n Page 29 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nwere taken by plaintiffs. He would contend that in the\n\ninstant case there were three rejections namely on\n\n27.10.1970, the Charity Commissioner accorded\n\npermission to sell the suit schedule property within a\n\nfixed time. Subsequently, by order dated 26.02.1986 it\n\nrejected the application filed by Vitthal Mandir Trust,\n\nagainst which two revisions were filed namely one by the\n\ntrust which was subsequently withdrawn and another\n\nrevision by Bansilal Amritlal Parikh which came to be\n\ndismissed on merits on 13.06.2001 which was confirmed\n\nin Special Civil Application No.7360 of 2001. He would\n\ncontend that trustees are also pujaris and they have a\n\nhereditary right. He would contend that terms and\n\nconditions of the agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974\n\n(Exh-194) are not fulfilled by the plaintiff and hence\n\nspecific performance ought to be rejected. He would\n\ncontend permission as required under \nSection 36\n has not\n\nbeen obtained from the Charity Commissioner for sale of\n\nsuit schedule property; time limit as contemplated under\n\nagreement dated 30.11.1973 is not adhered to; plaintiff\n\n Page 30 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nwas not possessing money as agreed to be paid under\n\nExhibit 194 and this is evident from the audit report\n\nExhibit 36.\n\n15. He would submit that obtaining prior\n\npermission under \nSection 36\n is mandatory and till filing of\n\nthe suit and even as on date no such permission has been\n\nobtained from the Charity Commissioner by the plaintiff.\n\n16. He would submit that plaintiff had earlier filed\n\na suit No.210 of 1983 and withdrew the same without any\n\nopportunity to institute fresh suit. He would contend that\n\nplaintiff has never whispered a word about readiness and\n\nwillingness. He would also submit that plaintiff who had\n\nto aver and prove that he has performed or has been\n\nalways ready and willing to perform has not been averred\n\nand proved. He would contend that ULC permission has\n\nbeen rejected and proof of payment of advance amount\n\nhas not been proved by the plaintiff. Hence, he has\n\nprayed for dismissal of the Appeal. In support of his\n\nsubmissions, he has relied upon the following judgments :\n\n Page 31 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n (i) 2021 Law Suit (SC) 601 - K.

He would also draw\n\nthe attention of the Court to the finding recorded by the\n\nTrial Court on issue Nos.2 and 3 to contend that plaintiff\n\nhas made false statements at four places and plaintiff's\n\nwitness did not produce authorization to represent the\n\nplaintiff or file the suit or depose before the Court. He\n\nwould submit that a specific defence has been taken by\n\nthe 5th defendant in paragraph 2 of the written statement\n\nand as such, the evidence tendered by the plaintiff cannot\n\nbe looked into by this Court. By relying upon the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Man Kaur\n\n(Dead) by Lrs. vs. Hartar Singh Sangha reported in\n\n(2010) 10 SCC 512 (paragraph 17), he would submit\n\n Page 37 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthat only person with personal knowledge could have\n\ndeposed about the transaction and present witness\n\nMr.Babulal is not a signatory to Exhibit 194 and none of\n\nthe persons who have witnessed the execution of Exhibit\n\n194 have entered the witness-box. Hence, he would\n\ncontend that evidence of Babulal need not be looked into.\n\n23. He would also contend that there is no pleading\n\nto the effect that Kunjbihari Bhagwat was the only trustee\n\nand he was authorized to sign on behalf of all the\n\ntrustees. In the absence of pleading no amount of\n\nevidence will help the party. \nIn support of this\n\nproposition, he has relied upon the judgment in the case\n\nof \nBiraji Alias Brijraji and another vs. Surya Pratap\n\nand others\n reported in (2020) 10 SCC 729. He would\n\nalso contend that plaintiff is guilty of suppression of facts\n\nnamely it has not whispered a word in the pleadings\n\nabout the application filed under \nSection 36\n having been\n\nrejected and hence, plaintiff is not entitled for\n\ndiscretionary relief namely specific performance.\n \nIn\n\nsupport of said submission, he has relied upon the\n\n Page 38 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in \nBhaskar Laxman\n\nJadhav and others vs. Karamveer Kakasaheb Wagh\n\nEducation Society and others\n, reported in (2013) 11\n\nSCC 531. He would contend that the conduct of the\n\nplaintiff disentitles it to any relief and by drawing the\n\nattention of the Court to the order dated 05.03.1992\n\npassed in CRA No.141 of 1987 as per the Exhibit 134 to\n\ncontend that even after direction issued, plaintiff had\n\nobtained 49 adjournments and as such, he prays for\n\nrejection of the appeal. He would contend that when\n\nGujarat Revenue Appellate Tribunal in Appeal\n\nNo.TGNAA.33 of 1986 had affirmed the order of the\n\nCharity Commissioner, who had refused to grant\n\npermission to sell the property, question of granting\n\nconditional decree does not arise. Hence, he prays for\n\nrejection of the appeal. In support of his submission, he\n\nhas relied upon following judgments :\n\n \n(\n1) N. Vijaya Kumar vs. Smt.

Mr.Devang Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate\n\nappearing for applicant in Civil Application No.3 of 2018\n\nwould contend that applicants are the holders of\n\nagreement of sale dated 18.08.1966 for which the Charity\n\nCommissioner had granted permission and claims to be\n\nnecessary and proper party to the present proceedings as\n\nthe suit schedule property for which the applicants have\n\ninitiated proceedings for specific performance. Hence,\n\nhe prays for the application being allowed. He has relied\n\nupon following judgments : -\n\n (i) (2007) 10 SCC 82 - Sumtibai and Others\n versus Paras Finance Co. Regd.\n\n Partnership Firm Beawer (Raj.) Through\n Mankanwar (Smt.)

He would submit that\n\ntrustees and trust have fiduciary relationship. He would\n\nalso contend that suit schedule property is an agricultural\n\nland and plaintiffs/purchasers are not agriculturists and\n\nthe transaction in question is hit by Section 63 of the\n\nGujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act. He would\n\nsubmit that \nSection 36\n and \nSection 80\n of the Trusts Act\n\nbars Civil Court's jurisdiction to grant any relief, as also\n\nSections 10\n, \n11\n an 14 of the \nSpecific Relief Act\n. He would\n\ncontend that there is no pleadings in the plaint that\n\ntransaction is for the benefit of trust and trustees had\n\nacted bonafide in the interest of trust. He would contend\n\nthat in the memorandum of appeal, there is no mention\n\nabout the finding of the Trial Court being erroneous or\n\nincorrect.\n\n26. He would also elaborate his submissions by\n\ncontending that neither the bye-laws of the plaintiff\n\nsociety have been produced nor the resolution. He would\n\nsubmit that the provisions of Order VI Rule 14 and 15 has\n\nnot been complied and the plaint presented is not in\n\n Page 43 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\naccordance with Order XXIX. Hence, he prays for\n\ndismissal of Appeal. In support of his submissions he has\n\nrelied upon following judgments : -\n\n (1) AIR 2022 SC 3361 - U.N. Krishnamurthy\n (since deceased) Thr. Lrs. Versus A.M.\n Krishnamurthy\n\n (2) Civil Appeal No. 150 of 2022 & 2022 (2)\n SCALE 56 - Shenbagam and others vs.\n K.K.Rathinavel\n\n (3) AIR 2020 SC 3413 - Atma Ram v.

By way of reply arguments, Shri Yatin Oza,\n\n Page 44 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant has\n\ncontended that there is an endorsement in Exhibit 194 of\n\npossession of suit schedule property having been\n\ndelivered to the plaintiff and as such proving the contents\n\nof Exhibit 194 does not arise. By referring to Exhibit 205,\n\nhe would contend that trustees (three trustees) have\n\nconsented for sale of suit schedule property in favour of\n\nthe plaintiff. According to him, when defendants have\n\nagreed and admitted that they have consented for sale of\n\nsuit schedule property, they cannot take any contrary\n\nstand in this Appeal. He would rely upon Exhibit 205 to\n\n207 to contend that all trustees have declared that all\n\nfour trustees have signed and have given approval to the\n\nagreement of sale Exhibit 194 by filing an application\n\nfiled before the Charity Commissioner dated 16.04.2001.\n\n28. He would also submit that defendant Nos.2 to 6\n\nhaving gone before the Charity Commissioner seeking\n\npermission to compromise and admitting thereunder that\n\nthey would be willing to execute the Sale Deed, they\n\ncannot now contend that there are no pleadings with\n\n Page 45 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nregard to readiness and willingness. He would draw the\n\nattention of the Court to Civil Application No.2 of 2014\n\nand Civil Application No.6 of 2022 to contend that\n\nplaintiffs have admitted to have filed application before\n\nthe Charity Commissioner agreeing and willing to sell the\n\nsuit schedule property in favour of plaintiff. Shri Oza,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel would contend since \nULC Act\n has\n\nbeen repealed, the order of rejection of ULC authorities\n\nwould be of no consequences and in support of his\n\nsubmission, he has relied upon 2020 SCC Online 825.\n\n29. By relying upon the judgments reported in\n\n2022 SCC Online (SC) 351 and (2016) 14 SCC 161,\n\nhe would contend that defendants cannot be allowed to\n\ntake contradictory stands namely having taken a stand\n\nbefore the Charity Commissioner agreeing to sell the suit\n\nschedule property in favour of the plaintiff cannot now\n\ncontend and try to find holes in the plaint to stave off the\n\nclaim of plaintiff. He would also contend that\n\nendorsement made on 18.04.1976 in Exhibit 194 by\n\ndefendants would clearly go to show that possession of\n\n Page 46 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthe suit schedule property was delivered to plaintiff. He\n\nwould also submit that issue regarding readiness and\n\nwillingness was not framed and Court below had\n\ncommitted an error in recording a finding on the said\n\naspect without framing an issue. In reply to the argument\n\nof Mr.Mangukiya that the suit is hit by Order II Rule 2, he\n\nrelies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\n(2004) 11 SCC 219. In reply to the argument that\n\nExhibit 194 is hit by Section 63 of the Gujarat Tenancy\n\nand Agricultural Lands Act, he would contend that Clause\n\n(c) of the Section 63 was inserted with effect from 1977\n\nnamely by Act 30 of 1977 and Section 64A then prevailing\n\npermitted sale of agricultural property in favour of a\n\ncooperative housing society and this provision was\n\ndeleted only from 1987 namely by Act 21 of 1987 and as\n\nsuch, he prays for rejection of the contentions raised by\n\nthe respondents and prays for appeal being allowed.\n\n30. Having heard the learned advocates appearing\n\nfor the parties we are of the considered view that\n\nfollowing points would arise for our consideration :\n\n Page 47 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n (i) Whether the applications filed for\n additional evidence in Civil Application\n Nos. 2 of 2007, 3 of 2007, 2 of 2014, 3 of\n 2014, 1 of 2015, 2 of 2022, 3 of 2022, 4\n of 2022, 5 of 2022 and 6 of 2022,\n deserve to be allowed or rejected ?\n\n (ii) Whether Civil Application No. 1 of 2016\n filed by 5th respondent under \nsection 151\n\n CPC and order 14 Rule 2(2) \nof CPC\n and\n \nSection 46\n of Bombay Public Trust Act,\n 1950 deserves to be allowed or\n dismissed ?\n\n (iii) Whether Civil Application No. 1 of 2022\n filed by appellant for deletion of\n respondent no. 2 to 10 from the Appeal\n appeal deserves to be allowed or\n rejected ?\n\n (iv) Whether Civil Application No. 3 of 2018,\n filed by the proposed respondents for\n being impleaded as respondents in First\n Appeal deserves to be allowed or\n dismissed ?\n\n (v) Whether Civil Application No. 7 of 2022\n filed by the appellant deserves to be\n\n Page 48 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n allowed and as such proposed applicants\n are to be impleaded as respondents 16\n and 17 or it is to be rejected ?\n\n (vi) Whether the judgment and decree\n passed in Special Civil Suit No. 167 of\n 1984 deserves to be set aside or\n confirmed or to be varied ?\n\n (vii) Whether the court below has properly\n evaluated the evidence both oral and\n documentary tendered before it in\n proper perspective or it suffers from any\n infirmity whatsoever calling for\n interference ?\n\n (viii) Whether what order ?\n\n31.

On issue No. 3, learned trial Judge has arrived\n\nat a conclusion that plaintiffs have failed to prove the\n\nsame namely having paid Rs. 45,000/- to defendant No.\n\n14 and Rs. 30,501/- to defendant Nos. 1 to 8.\n\n35. Issue No. 4 and 5 related to plaintiff proving its\n\nalleged possession of suit schedule property and same\n\nhas been held to have not been proved by plaintiff, by\n\narriving at a conclusion that plaintiff had failed to prove\n\npossession of suit schedule property having been\n\ndelivered by 14 defendant to plaintiff. It has been further\n\nheld that form 7/12 for the year 1975-76 would reflect the\n\nname of Anubhai Premchand in the columns of\n\npossession. It has also been held plaintiff has not\n\nexamined the Watchman who according to plaintiff had\n\nbeen appointed to take care of suit schedule property.\n\nThe alleged claim of plaintiff that defendants were\n\nattempting to dispossess the plaintiff from suit schedule\n\n Page 57 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nproperty has been negatived by answering issue no. 5\n\nagainst plaintiff and it has been further held that plaintiff\n\nhad failed to prove alleged threat of defendants and their\n\nattempts to take forcible possession of suit schedule\n\nproperty.\n\n36. At regards issue No. 6 to 8 it has been held in\n\nthe negative by the trial Court. To prove issue no. 6,\n\nburden was cast on defendants. It was the plea of\n\ndefendant that suit schedule property was in possession\n\nof a tenant. On account of document having not been\n\ntendered before trial Court, it has been held that\n\ndefendants had failed to prove said issue. Issue No. 7 & 8\n\nare also held to be not proved by defendants according to\n\nlearned trial Judge on the ground that extension of time\n\nwas agreed for performance of agreement of sale.\n\n37. Insofar as issue No. 8-A which related to res\n\njudicata, it came to be held by trial Judge that plaintiff\n\nhad filed an application to get itself impleaded in First\n\nAppeal No. 362 of 1976, which came to be rejected by\n\n Page 58 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nobserving that consent decree passed in Civil Suit No. 16\n\nof 1971 would not affect the right of plaintiff vide order\n\ndated 07.07.1983 passed in Civil Appeal No. 2437 of 1983\n\n(Exhibit 124/1) and considering said order, present suit\n\nwas held to be maintainable and it was not barred by res\n\njudicata.\n\n38. While answering issue No. 9 & 10 in the\n\nnegative, learned trial Judge has observed permission of\n\nCharity Commissioner was lacking; permission from\n\ncompetent authority for selling agricultural land was not\n\nthere; all the conditions of agreement of sale is not\n\nsatisfied; plaintiff was not ready and willing to pay\n\nbalance sale consideration; ULC permission was not\n\navailable; on these grounds these two issues were\n\nanswered against plaintiffs.\n\n39. Having regard to the alternative prayer of\n\nrefund of advance money paid by plaintiff, same has been\n\nordered to be re-paid by defendant Nos. 1 to 8 and 14\n\nnamely Rs. 25,000/- & 40,000/- respectively with interest\n\n Page 59 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n@ 12% p.a. from date of receipt.\n\n40. In the aforesaid background, we proceed to\n\nadjudicate the points formulated hereinabove.\n\n DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS\n\nRE : POINT NO. (i)\n\n41. These applications namely Civil Application No.\n\n2 of 2007, 3 of 2007, 2 of 2014, 3 of 2014, 1 of 2015, 2 of\n\n2022, 3 of 2022, 4 of 2022, 5 of 2022 and 6 of 2022 have\n\nbeen filed under Order 41 Rule 27 for production of\n\nadditional evidence.\n\n42. Before proceeding to adjudicate as to whether\n\nthese applications are to be allowed or dismissed, it\n\nwould be apt and appropriate to note the contours of\n\nconsideration of such applications. It is trite law that\n\njurisdiction of the Appellate Court would be exercised not\n\nonly when Clause (a) or Clause (aa) of Sub-Rule (1) of\n\nRule 27 of Order 41 of the code is attracted but also\n\nwhere such document is required by the Appellate Court\n\nto pronounce the judgment or for any other substantial\n\n Page 60 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ncause. If such additional evidence would have a material\n\nbearing on the crucial issue arising for decision between\n\nthe parties, such application would be allowed de hors\n\nthe allowable deficiency, if any. If certified copy of public\n\ndocuments are produced and they have a bearing on the\n\nissue involved in the Appeal or the said document would\n\nthrow light on the issue to be adjudicated in the Appeal,\n\nthen also appellate Court would be justified in allowing\n\nthe application for additional evidence. However, if the\n\nsaid documents would in no way espouse the cause of\n\neither of the parties or it has some remote connection\n\nwhich would not be necessary for arriving at ultimate\n\nconclusion, then, such documents would not be permitted\n\nto be taken on record. In the absence of plea raised, no\n\nany amount of evidence tendered would be of any use.\n\n43. The Appellate Court has power to allow\n\nadditional evidence not only if it requires such evidence\n\n\"to enable it to pronounce judgment\" but also for \"any\n\nother substantial cause\". Though general rule is that\n\n Page 61 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nordinarily, the Appellate Court would not travel outside\n\nthe record of the lower Court and additional evidence,\n\nwhether oral or documentary is not admitted, but \nSection\n\n107\n of CPC carves out in exception to the General Rule\n\nand enables the Appellate Court to take additional\n\nevidence or to require such evidence to be taken, subject\n\nto such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed\n\nnamely as prescribed under Rule 27 of Order 41.\n\nCircumstances under which additional evidence are\n\nadduced are; firstly - the Court from whose decree the\n\nAppeal is preferred has refused to admit evidence which\n\nought to have been admitted [Clause (a) of Sub-Rule (1)],\n\nsecondly - the parties seeking to produce additional\n\nevidence establishes that notwithstanding the exercise of\n\ndue diligence such evidence was not within the\n\nknowledge or after exercise of due diligence be produced\n\nby him at the time when the decree appealed against was\n\npassed (Clause (aa) of Sub-Rule (1)); thirdly - the\n\nAppellate Court requires any document to be produced or\n\nany witness to be examined to enable it to pronounce\n\n Page 62 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\njudgment, or for any other substantial cause (Clause (b)\n\nof Sub-Rule (1).\n\n44. The scope of Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 27 of Order\n\n41 was examined by Privy Counsel way back in 1931 in\n\nthe matter of \nParsotim Thakur versus Lal Mohar\n\nThakur\n reported in AIR 1931 PC 143 and held by\n\nobserving that provisions of Section 107 is elucidated by\n\norder 41 Rule 27 are not clearly intended to allow litigant\n\nwho has been unsuccessful in the Lower Court to patch\n\nup the weak parts of his case and fill up the omissions in\n\nthe Court of Appeal.\n \nThe aforesaid principle was noticed\n\nby the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nNorth Eastern\n\nRailway Administration, Gorakhpur vs. Bhagwan\n\nDas (Dead) by Lrs\n. - (2008) 8 SCC 511 and held as\n\nunder : -\n\n \n\"15. Again in \nK. Venkataramiah Vs. A. Seetharama\n Reddy & Ors.\n a Constitution Bench of this Court while\n reiterating the afore-noted observations in Parsotim's\n case (supra), pointed out that the appellate court has\n the power to allow additional evidence not only if it\n requires such evidence 'to enable it to pronounce\n judgment' but also for 'any other substantial cause'.\n There may well be cases where even though the court\n finds that it is able to pronounce judgment on the state\n of the record as it is, and so, it cannot strictly say that\n it requires additional evidence 'to enable it to\n\n Page 63 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n pronounce judgment', it still considers that in the\n interest of justice something which remains obscure\n should be filled up so that it can pronounce its\n judgment in a more satisfactory manner. Thus, the\n question whether looking into the documents, sought to\n be filed as additional evidence, would be necessary to\n pronounce judgment in a more satisfactory manner,\n has to be considered by the Court at the time of\n hearing of the appeal on merits.\"\n\n45. Thus, irresistible conclusion which can be\n\ndrawn is, if appellate Court finds that additional evidence\n\nsought to be admitted, are necessary to pronounce\n\njudgment in a satisfactory manner, it would allow the\n\napplication as otherwise it would be dismissed. The\n\ncaveat on this issue would be that before considering or\n\nadjudicating the Appeal on merits, it would be apt and\n\nappropriate that such application filed for additional\n\nevidence being taken up before taking up the Appeal.\n\nHence, we are examining these applications\n\nindependently before proceedings to adjudicate the\n\nAppeal on merits.\n\n46. In the instant case, it requires to be noticed\n\nthat plaintiff has filed the suit for specific performance of\n\nagreement to sell dated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194).

None of these documents have any bearing\n\nfor deciding the real controversy between the parties\n\ninvolved in the present Appeal. Except document No. 3,\n\nwhich is a certified copy of the order passed by the\n\nCommissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) that too along\n\nwith an affidavit dated 30.07.2022. All other three\n\ndocuments are not certified copies, that apart we find\n\nthat these documents would not be required for\n\nadjudication of the real controversy between the parties\n\nand as such, said application stands rejected.\n\nCivil Application No. 1 of 2015\n\n57. This is an application filed for production of the\n\norder dated 13.06.2007 passed by Gujarat Revenue\n\nTribunal.

Since one of the issue involved in the\n\npresent Appeal is whether there was a permission by the\n\nCharity Commissioner under \nsection 36\n of the Gujarat\n\nPublic Trusts Act to sell the suit schedule property by the\n\nfirst defendant trust or otherwise, we are of the\n\nconsidered view that said application requires to be\n\nallowed and accordingly it is allowed and the document is\n\npermitted to be marked as Exhibit 223.\n\nCivil Application No. 2 of 2022\n\n58. This is an application filed for production of\n\nfollowing documents by way of additional evidence : -\n\n 1. Photocopy of the order passed by the\n Charity Commissioner dated 26.06.1967.\n\n 2. Photocopy of the order dated 16.09.1991\n passed by the Joint Charity Commissioner,\n Ahmedabad in Inquiry Case No. 30/85.\n\n 3.

Photocopy of the application\n No.36/59/2003 said to have been filed by\n trustees of Vitthal Mandir Trust before the\n Charity Commissioner on 30.08.2003.\n\n 6. Copy of the order dated 31.01.2004 in\n Application No. 36/59/2003.\n\n59. The documents which are sought to be\n\nproduced as Annexure C to F (as indicated in the Civil\n\nApplication) have also been sought for being produced by\n\nthe fifth respondent in Civil Application No. 2 of 2014,\n\nwhich has been allowed by us by order of even date\n\nhereinabove. Thus, what remains to be considered is\n\nwhether documents styled as Annexure A and B are to be\n\nproduced or not ? These are two orders which are\n\npassed by the Charity Commissioner and Joint Charity\n\nCommissioner dated 26.06.1967 and 16.09.1991 along\n\nwith enclosures thereto to contend that trustees of the\n\nfirst defendant have given consent for agreement to sell\n\ndated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194) as same is reflected in the\n\n Page 77 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nsaid order. Both these orders are photocopies and\n\noriginal or certified copies are not produced. On this\n\nground alone, it is liable to be rejected and accordingly it\n\nstands rejected. Consequently Civil Application No. 2 of\n\n2022 stands rejected.\n\nCivil Application No. 3 of 2022\n\n60. By this application defendant intends to\n\nproduce the copy of the scheme dated 06.06.1989 framed\n\nby the learned Charity Commissioner in respect of first\n\ndefendant trust. On the short ground, this document was\n\nalso sought to be produced by fifth respondent by Civil\n\nApplication No. 2 of 2007 (Old Civil Application No. 6794\n\nof 2007), which has already been dismissed vide order of\n\neven date referred to supra, we are of the considered\n\nview that entertaining of this application would not arise\n\nand it stands rejected. It is also noticed said document is\n\nsought for being produced along with Civil Application\n\nNo.6 of 2022 and as such it would be examined when we\n\ntake-up Civil Application No.6 of 2022.\n\n Page 78 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nCivil Application No. 4 of 2022\n\n61. By this application, fifth defendant has sought\n\nfor production of nine documents styled as Annexure A to\n\nI. By these documents, fifth defendant seeks to buttress\n\nthe arguments that structure of the plaintiff society has\n\nchanged and most of the old members of the society were\n\nremoved and new persons were inducted. The\n\napplication filed before the Assistant District Registrar,\n\nCooperative Society, Ahmedabad, seeking the list and\n\nmembers of the plaintiff society and exchange of\n\ncorrespondence between fifth defendant and the officials\n\nof the Corporation Department, is sought to be produced.\n\nIn substance, fifth defendant intends to place reliance on\n\nthe reply received from Cooperative Department to\n\ncontend that old members have resigned and new\n\nmembers have been inducted to the plaintiff society.\n\nUndisputedly, these documents have come into existence\n\nsubsequent to the filing of the suit. It is no doubt true\n\nthat subsequent events can be taken note by this Court as\n\nheld by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M/s.\n\n Page 79 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nVariety Emporium vs. V.R.M. Mohd. Ibrahim Naina\n,\n\nreported in 1985 AIR SC 207. At the cost of repetition,\n\nit requires to be noticed that applicant will have to be\n\nnecessarily establish as to how the said evidence would\n\nbe of any relevance for adjudication of the issue relating\n\nto the grant of decree for specific performance or not. It\n\nis not doubt true that issue of hardship or exercise of\n\ndiscretionary relief is concerned, same would be\n\nconsidered as one of the factors. However, that by itself\n\nwould not be sufficient to arrive at a conclusion one way\n\nor the other. In other words, the issue relating to grant\n\nof specific performance or refusal would not hinge upon\n\nthese documents and it would not be of any vital\n\nimportance for this Court to adjudicate the rival claims\n\nthat has been raised in this regard. Hence, we are of the\n\nconsidered view that these documents would not be of\n\nany relevance for adjudicating the real controversy\n\nbetween the parties and as such Civil Application No. 4 of\n\n2022 stands rejected.\n\nCivil Application No. 5 of 2022 and 6 of 2022\n\n Page 80 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n62. These applications have been filed for\n\nproduction of documents specified therein. As could be\n\nseen from Civil Application No. 5 of 2022, plaintiff -\n\nappellant is seeking for production of copy of the order\n\ndated 16.09.1991 passed by Joint Charity Commissioner,\n\nAhmedabad in Inquiry Case No. 30/85 and for production\n\nof application dated 12.04.2022 filed by it seeking\n\ncertified copies from the Charity Commissioner. In fact\n\nthese two documents have also been sought for being\n\nproduced through Civil Application No.6 of 2022. On this\n\nground, Civil Application No.5 of 2022 is dismissed.\n\n63. Whereas, Civil Application No. 6 of 2022 is filed\n\nby appellant seeking production of two documents\n\nreferred to hereinabove, as well as copy of order dated\n\n26.06.1967 and applications filed by the trustees of the\n\nfirst defendant - Trust before the Charity Commissioner\n\nincluding the order passed thereon.

It is contended that\n\ntrustees of Vitthal Mandir Trust - defendant No.1\n\nexecuted an agreement of sale in favour of Mr.\n\nMukundbhai Chimanbhai Shah (Jalpa Traders) on\n\n3.4.1972 for selling the suit schedule property and in turn\n\nJalpa Traders executed an agreement in favour of\n\nChhaganlal & Company - defendant No.14 on 23.11.1973\n\nand this was confirmed by defendant No.1 trust. It is\n\nfurther stated that Chhaganlal & Company executed an\n\nagreement of sale in favour of the plaintiff society on\n\n27.12.1974. He would contend that defendant No.1 trust\n\nhad also executed an agreement to sell on 23.5.1964 in\n\nfavour of Mr. Manharlal Nagindas Bhandari and\n\npermission had also been granted by the Charity\n\nCommissioner on 4.6.1964 to sell the suit schedule\n\nproper in favour of Mr. Manharlal Bhadari and he had\n\ninstituted a Civil Suit No.16 of 1971 against Bhagwat\n\nFamily, Mr. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh, Mr. Ambalal\n\n Page 86 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nIshwarlal Prajapati and Sharda Mandir Trust for specific\n\nperformance, damages and for the permanent injunction\n\nwhich came to be dismissed on 17.4.1976 which was\n\nchallenged in First Appeal No.362 of 1976, wherein a\n\nsettlement was arrived at agreeing thereunder that in\n\ncase consent terms were not acted upon, liberty being\n\nreserved to proceed with the suit. Hence, the original\n\napplicants are said to have filed SCS No.68 of 1983 for\n\nspecific performance which has been dismissed on\n\n13.9.1996 which was challenged in First Appeal No.5304\n\nof 1996 which appeal came to be transferred to the\n\nDistrict Court and renumbered as RA No.27 of 2006\n\nwhich was then partly allowed on 19.6.2012 and\n\nremanded the matter back to the Trial Court as directed\n\nthereunder. An application filed in the said suit by the\n\nlegal heirs of Mr. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and Mr.\n\nAmbalal Ishwarlal Prajapati came to be dismissed by the\n\nTrial Court on 1.10.2015 and consequently held that\n\nSpecial Civil Suit No.68 of 1983 had stood abated.\n\nAgainst the said order, Special Civil Application No.18589\n\n Page 87 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nof 2015 was filed challenging the order dated 1.10.2015\n\nand same is said to be pending. Hence, contending that\n\nany judgment and decree passed in this appeal would\n\nadversely affect their interest in pending Special Civil\n\nApplication No.18589 of 2015, applicants are before this\n\nCourt for being impleaded / joined as parties.\n\n68. Reiterating the contentions raised in the\n\napplication and grounds urged thereunder, Mr. Devang\n\nNanavati, learned Senior Advocate seeks for allowing the\n\nsaid application. \nIn support of his submission, he has\n\nrelied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nthe case of \nSumtibai and others vs. Paras Finance Co.\n\nand others\n [(2007) 10 SCC 82] and in the case of \nM.P.\n\nState Agro Industries Development Corporation Ltd.\n\nand Another vs. Jahan Khan\n [(2007) 10 SCC 88]. The\n\ngeneral rule for impleadment is that the plaintiff being\n\nthe dominus litis would choose the person against whom\n\nhe intends to litigate and he cannot be compelled to sue a\n\nperson against whom he does not seek any relief. A plain\n\nreading of sub-rule (2) of Rule 10 of Order 1 would make\n\n Page 88 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nit explicitly clear that a court may at any stage of the\n\nproceedings either upon or even if any application, and\n\non such terms as may appear to it to be just, direct that\n\nany person who ought to have been joined whether as\n\nplaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the court\n\nmay be necessary in order to enable the court to\n\neffectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all\n\nquestions involved in the suit, be added as party. In short,\n\ncourt is given the discretion to add a person as a party\n\nwho is found to be necessary parties are proper parties.\n\n \nThe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nMumbai\n\nInternational Airport Private Limited vs. Regency\n\nConvention Centre and Hotels Private Limited and\n\nOthers\n [(2010) 7 SCC 417] has indicated as to who\n\nwould the necessary party or a proper party. It has been\n\nheld as under:\n\n \"15. A `necessary party' is a person who ought to have\n been joined as a party and in whose absence no\n effective decree could be passed at all by the Court. If a\n `necessary party' is not impleaded, the suit itself is\n liable to be dismissed. A `proper party' is a party who,\n though not a necessary party, is a person whose\n presence would enable the court to completely,\n effectively and adequately adjudicate upon all matters\n\n Page 89 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n in disputes in the suit, though he need not be a person\n in favour of or against whom the decree is to be made.\n If a person is not found to be a proper or necessary\n party, the court has no jurisdiction to implead him,\n against the wishes of the plaintiff. The fact that a\n person is likely to secure a right/interest in a suit\n property, after the suit is decided against the plaintiff,\n will not make such person a necessary party or a\n proper party to the suit for specific performance.\"\n\n69. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Kasturi\n\nvs. Iyyamperumal [(2005) 6 SCC 733] has held that\n\nfollowing persons are to be considered as necessary\n\nparties:\n\n (i) The parties to the contract which is sought\n to be enforced or their legal\n representatives;\n\n (ii) Transferee of the property which is the\n subject matter of the contract.\n\n70. It has also been held that a person claiming\n\ntitle adverse to the title of the vendor could not be\n\nimpleaded. Keeping these principles in mind when we\n\nturn our attention to the facts on hand it would clearly\n\nindicate that applicants who are claiming to be the legal\n\nheirs of Mr. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and Mr. Ambalal\n\n Page 90 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nIshwarlal Prajapati in whose favour there was an\n\nagreement of sale are seeking to be impleaded in the\n\npresent proceedings which is a suit filed by the plaintiff\n\nclaiming specific performance on the strength of\n\nagreement to sell dated 27.12.1974 Exhibit 194.

It is further pleaded that at the first instance\n\nagreed price was Rs. 3.25 paisa per sq. mtr., and same\n\nwas agreed to be revised upwards by Rs. 2 per sq. mtr.\n\ntotalling Rs. 5.25 per sq. mtr. while assigning all rights\n\nover the suit land in favour of plaintiff society by the\n\ndefendants.

Plaintiff further\n\npleads that on 18.04.1976, vacant and peaceful\n\npossession of the suit schedule property was handed over\n\n Page 96 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nto the plaintiff by the defendants.\n\n76. It is the further case of the plaintiff that first\n\ndefendant has received Rs. 20,001/- towards sale\n\nconsideration by cheque dated 21.10.1982 which has\n\nbeen duly accepted by the first defendant and same was\n\npaid in lieu of defective cheque dated 11.08.1982.

Plaintiff has further pleaded that defendant\n\ntrustees filed an application seeking permission to sell the\n\nsuit schedule property before the Charity Commissioner -\n\n16th defendant under \nsection 36\n of the BPT Act. The\n\ndefendants are also said to have filed form No. 1 under\n\nsection 20\n of the Urban Land Ceiling Act (then\n\nprevailing), wherein it is said to have been stated\n\nspecifically by the defendants that suit land was being\n\nsold to the plaintiff.\n\n79. Plaintiff has contended that first defendant -\n\ntrust was attempting to dispose of the suit land to\n\nsomeone else, owing to escalation in land price and it\n\nwould adversely effect its rights. It was also contended\n\nthat plaintiff's possession over the suit schedule property\n\nwas sought to be disturbed and attempts were made to\n\ndispossess the plaintiff from suit schedule property by\n\nposing threats. It is contended that defendants were not\n\n Page 98 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nexecuting the sale deed in spite having demanded and a\n\npolice complaint was lodged in that regard contending\n\nthat trustees of the defendant trust are attempting to sell\n\nthe suit schedule property to third party and pleading\n\nthat members of the plaintiff society are middle class\n\nperson and have invested huge amounts they would be\n\nput to great loss if the defendants were to sell the suit\n\nschedule property to third party or disturb plaintiff's\n\npossession. Hence, plaintiff filed a Civil Suit No. 210 of\n\n1983 for permanent injunction which was withdrawn on\n\n17.07.1984 and thereafter the present suit for specific\n\nperformance came to be filed.\n\n80. On service of suit summons, defendants No. 1\n\nto 4 and 6 appeared and have filed their written\n\nstatements denying the averments made in the plaint and\n\nputting plaintiff into strict proof of the same. It has been\n\nspecifically contended as noticed hereinabove, the\n\npresent suit was barred by res judicata since similar suit\n\nfiled earlier had been withdrawn without any valid\n\nreason. It was also contended that suit is barred by\n\n Page 99 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nlimitation; suit was not maintainable as per \nsection 51\n of\n\nBPT Act, since written permission had not been obtained\n\nfrom the Charity Commissioner for filing the suit. It was\n\ncontended that defendant had executed an agreement to\n\nsell the suit schedule property to Mr. Pramukhlal and\n\nMr.Ambalal and later on first defendant trust and\n\nMr.Pramukhlal executed another agreement to sell the\n\nsuit land in favour of Mr.Gangaram Pavde which\n\nagreement was not duly signed by all the trustees. It was\n\nalso contended that agreement to sell entered into\n\nbetween first defendant and Mr.Pramukhlal and\n\nMr.Ambalal did not contain the signature of Mr.Ambalal\n\nand as such it was not a legal and valid document. The\n\nassignment or transfer of the rights by Mr.Gangaram\n\nPavde to third party was denied and plaintiff was put to\n\nstrict proof of the same. It was contended that agreement\n\nto sell dated 08.05.1972 executed in favour of\n\nMr.Mukundbhai on behalf of Jalpa Traders had been\n\nsigned by one of the trustees namely Mr. Kunjbihari, who\n\nhad not been authorized by all the trustees to enter into\n\n Page 100 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nsuch agreement and as such denied that trust was\n\nanswerable and also denied that Kunjbihari being the\n\nmanaging trustee of the trust was entiteld to enter an\n\nagreement of sale of suit schedule property. Other\n\naverments made in the plaint had also been denied as\n\nalready noticed hereinabove. It was specifically denied\n\nthat first defendant being a public trust registered under\n\nBPT Act\n, it cannot sell the suit schedule property without\n\nobtaining permission from the 17th defendant and there\n\nwas no such permission granted by the Charity\n\nCommissioner. The delivery of possession of suit schedule\n\nproperty also came to be denied. As noticed hereinabove\n\naverments made in the plaint has been denied by these\n\ndefendants. Sum and substance of the defence put forth\n\nby defendant no. 1 to 4 and 6 have already been noticed\n\nby us hereinabove.\n\n81. In this background, when judgment passed by\n\nthe trial court is looked into, it would emerge therefrom\n\nthat on the issue of agreement of sale, the learned trial\n\nJudge has framed to two issues namely issue no. 2 and 3\n\n Page 101 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nand has answered partly in the affirmative and partly in\n\nthe negative. In this process, the learned Trial Judge has\n\nrecorded a finding at paragraph 7 of the judgment, the\n\nsubstance of which can be formatted as under.\n\n82. The agreement to sell dated 27.12.1974 marked\n\nas Exhibit 194 has been held to have not been duly signed\n\nby all the trustees; the say of the plaintiff that Exhibit 194\n\nreflects Rs. 5,000/- and there is no mention of plaintiff\n\nhaving paid 5,500/- to defendants - trustees on\n\n30.12.1982 and no receipts are produced; there is\n\ninconsistency in the pleadings namely at one breath\n\nplaintiff has stated on oath that defendants have not filed\n\nnecessary application seeking permission. Whereas in\n\nanother breath, namely in the plaint they have contended\n\nnecessary applications have been filed by defendants\n\nbefore the Charity Commissioner and they had also filed\n\nform no. 1 under the Urban Land Ceiling Law; defendant\n\nno. 7 and 8 having not affixed their signatures to Exhibit\n\n194 and thereby the plea of the plaintiff that all the\n\ntrustees of the trust having signed Exhibit 194 has been\n\n Page 102 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndisbelieved by the trial court.\n\n83. At the outset, it requires to be noticed that\n\nburden is on the plaintiff to prove the execution of the\n\nagreement of sale dated 27.12.1974. In the instant case,\n\nundisputedly the first defendant has not executed the\n\nagreement of sale dated 27.12.1974 in favour of the\n\nplaintiff and this is an admitted fact or in other words,\n\nplaintiff does not dispute this fact. On the other hand,\n\nwitness examined on behalf of plaintiff namely Mr.\n\nBabubhai who claimed to be the Chairman of the plaintiff\n\nsociety has clearly admitted in his deposition that\n\ndefendants no. 2 to 8 are trustees of the first defendant\n\ntrust which is a trust registered under the Bombay Public\n\nTrust Act. He further deposes that defendant no. 1 to 8\n\nexecuted the agreement of sale dated 18.08.1966 in\n\nfavour of Mr. Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh and Mr.\n\nAmbalal Ishwarlal Prajapati. It is pertinent to note at\n\nthis juncture that said agreement of sale dated\n\n18.08.1966 has not seen the light of the day. He\n\nfurther deposes that Mr. Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh and\n\n Page 103 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthe first defendant trust together executed an agreement\n\nof sale on 21.09.1970 in favour of one Shri Gangaram\n\nBhaskarrao Pavde. It is pertinent to note at this\n\njuncture that said agreement of sale also has not\n\nseen the light of the day. It is further case of plaintiff\n\nthat on 03.04.1972, said Shri Gangaram Bhaskarrao\n\nPavde assigned the rights of his sale agreement in favour\n\nof a partnership firm M/s. Jalpa Traders represented by\n\nits partner Mr. Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah. The said\n\nagreement of assignment dated 03.04.1972 has also\n\nnot seen the light of the day. It is further necessary to\n\nnotice at this juncture that agreement of sale executed in\n\nfavour of Shri Gangaram Bhaskarrao Pavde was by Shri\n\nPramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh and the first defendant trust\n\nonly. In other words, the other person who possessed the\n\nright by virtue of agreement of sale dated 18.08.1966\n\nnamely Shri Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati has not affixed\n\nhis signature to the agreement of sale dated 21.09.1970.\n\nThus, no right flowed in favour of Shri Gangaram\n\nBhaskarrao Pavde to execute the agreement of sale or\n\n Page 104 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nassign his rights in favour of M/s. Jalpa Traders, in\n\nrespect of suit schedule property that too in respect of\n\nshare of Mr.Pramukhlal Jeevanlal Parikh. Thus, what\n\nright flowed to either Jalpa Traders or Mukundbhai\n\nChimanbhai Shah is only limited right or half of the right\n\nhe possessed over the suit schedule property.\n\n84. Be that as it may. The said Mukundbhai\n\nChimanbhai Shah partner of M/s. Jalpa Traders is said to\n\nhave executed an agreement of sale or assigned the\n\nrights which partnership firm possessed or acquired on\n\n03.04.1972 in favour of Chhaganlal & Company under a\n\ndeed of Agreement of Sale dated 23.11.1973. It is\n\npertinent to note at this juncture that said\n\nagreement of sale has also not seen the light of the\n\nday. All these deeds, agreements or assignment deed/s\n\nhave neither been tendered come before the trial Court\n\nnor it has been tendered by the plaintiff before this Court.\n\nOn account of these documents having been denied in\n\ntoto by defendant no. 1 to 4 and 6 in their written\n\nstatement, burden cast on the plaintiff has not been\n\n Page 105 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndischarged. However, for reasons best known, plaintiff\n\ndid not produce any of these deeds or documents to prove\n\nthe chain of events which culminated in execution of the\n\nsubject agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974 Exhibit 194.\n\n85. Thus, initial burden which was cast upon\n\nplaintiff has not been discharged and on this ground\n\nalone, plaintiff ought to have been non-suited.\n\n86. Now we turn our attention to the agreement of\n\nsale Exhibit 194 dated 27.12.1974 based on which suit\n\nhas been filed. This is an agreement of sale - said to have\n\nbeen executed by partner of M/s.Chaganlal & Co., in\n\nfavour of plaintiff society and plaintiff claims same has\n\nbeen consented to by the 1st defendant - trust and its\n\ntrustees and as such it is binding on them and they are\n\nrequired to execute the sale deed in favour of plaintiff. It\n\nis contended by the plaintiff that it had paid a sum of Rs.\n\n15,000/- on the date of agreement of sale to its vendor\n\nnamely Chhaganlal & Company - 14th defendant. It has\n\nbeen further pleaded that a sum of Rs. 20,000/- was paid\n\n Page 106 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\non 21.10.1982 and then Rs. 5,000/- is paid on 30.12.1982.\n\nIt is also claimed that another sum of Rs. 5,000/- was paid\n\non 04.06.1983 by cheque. Thus, plaintiff claimed that in\n\nall it had paid Rs. 30,501/- to defendant trust. Whereas\n\nPW-1 claims that plaintiff in all had paid Rs. 45,000/- to\n\nM/s. Chhaganlal & Company, the 14th defendant.\n\nWhereas, averments made in the plaint is contrary to\n\nwhat is stated in plaint. Thus, as rightly pointed out by\n\nthe trial Judge, the plea in the plaint itself is not only\n\ninconsistent but also contrary to the plea raised in the\n\nplaint as well as statement made on oath by plaintiff's\n\nwitness Mr. Babulal in his deposition.\n\n87. Thus, plaintiff is claiming right to seek specific\n\nenforcement of agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974\n\n(Exhibit 194). To prove said agreement one Shri Babubhai\n\nhas been examined. Perusal of his examination-in-chief\n\nwould indicate plaintiffs have tried to trace their right to\n\nseek specific performance based on Exhibit 194, which is\n\nan agreement of sale dated 27.12.1974 executed by the\n\npartner of M/s.Chaganlal & Co., namely Mr. Chhaganlal\n\n Page 107 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nGirdhar Patel in favour of plaintiff society. There is a\n\nreference to agreement to sell dated 18.08.1966 said to\n\nhave been executed by trustee and administrator of 1 st\n\ndefendant trust in favour of Shri Pramukhlal Jivanlal\n\nAmbalal and Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati (which\n\ndocument is not produced or has seen light of the day, as\n\nalready observed hereinabove). Aforesaid two agreement\n\nholder namely Shri Pramukhlal and Shri Ambalal, one of\n\nthem namely Shri Pramukhlal Jivanlal Ambalal along with\n\none Shri Kunjbihari Madhavdas Bhagvat, Managing\n\nTrustee of 1st defendant trust is said to have executed an\n\nagreement of sale on 21.09.1970 in favour of Shri\n\nGangaram Baskarrao Pavde (which document has also\n\nnot seen light of the day). It is also contended that by\n\nvirtue of said Banakhat dated 21.09.1970, Shri Gangaram\n\nBhaskarrao Pavde gave away all the rights of Banakhat\n\nand assigned it to Shri Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah,\n\npartner of M/s. Jalpa Traders on 08.05.1972 along with\n\nShri Kunjbihari Madhavlal Bhagwat. The said M/s. Jalpa\n\nTraders is said to have executed a banakhat assigning all\n\n Page 108 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nrights in favour of M/s. Chhaganlal & Co. Plaintiff has\n\nfurther pleaded by virtue of the said rights having vested\n\nwith M/s. Chhaganlal & Co., they in turn have executed\n\nan agreement to sale dated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194) in\n\nfavour of plaintiff. In order to prove the averments made\n\nin the plaint, as noticed hereinabove, plaintiff has got\n\nexamined Shri Babubhai, who has stated to the following\n\neffect :\n\n \"Defendant is Vithal Mandir Trust. It is a .....xxx......\n above trust. Defendants 1 to 8 execute sale agreement\n of the said land in favour of Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh\n and Ambalal Ishwarlal Prajapati on the date\n 18.08.1966. Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and the trust\n came together and made sale agreement in favour of\n Shri Gangaram Bhaskarrao Pavde on the day\n 21.09.1970. On the day 03.04.1972, Gangaram\n Bhaskarrao Pavade assigns the rights of his sale\n agreement to Mukundbhai Chimanlal Shah, a partner\n of the partnership firm in the name of Messers Jalpa\n Traders on the basis of said sale agreement. He made\n sale agreement in favour of Mukundbhai Chimanlal\n Shah. Thereafter, all the rights has been given to\n Messers Chhaganlal & Co. from Shri Mukundbhai\n Chimanlal Shah, a partner of Messers Jalpa Traders on\n the day 23/11/73. On the basis of all the rights in said\n agreement, Chhaganlal & Co. granted all its rights and\n sale said land to plaintiff on the day 27.12.1974. For\n that, plaintiff has given Rs. 15,000/- on the same date\n at the time of sale agreement. Then Rs. 25,000/- is\n given on 20.05.1975, and then Rs. 5,000/- is given on\n 15.12.1978. In this way, the plaintiff has paid Rs.\n 45,000/- to Messers Chhaganlal & Co. The execution of\n the sale agreement on dated 27.12.74 has been\n continued by the partners of Messers Chhaganlal & Co.\n and all the trustees of the aforesaid defendant trust.\n Defendant No. 1 to 8 have given all the rights of the\n\n Page 109 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n above land to the plaintiffs. The plaintiff is occupying\n the claimed land.\"\n\n87-A. Thus, comparison of the pleadings and\n\ndeposition wold clearly indicate that there is\n\ninconsistencies. On one hand, in the plaint, it has been\n\nstated at paragraph 1 to the effect that plaintiff society\n\nhas in all paid Rs. 30,501/- to the defendant trust,\n\nwhereas witness examined on behalf of plaintiff has\n\nstated that Rs. 45,000/- is paid to M/s. Chhaganlal & Co.\n\nThis inconsistency is at large and staring at face and as\n\nsuch, we are of the considered view that plaintiff has\n\nfailed to prove the plea raised in the plaint or there has\n\nbeen inconsistency between the pleadings and evidence.\n\n88. In order to prove its claim the plaintiff has\n\nexamined one witness Mr.Babulal who claims that he is the\n\nchairman of the plaintiff society on the date he was\n\ndeposing. He is neither signatory to the Agreement of Sale\n\nExhibit 194 nor witness to the said document. A perusal of\n\nhis deposition would indicate as though he is speaking to\n\nfacts and being conversant with same or in other words, he\n\n Page 110 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nwas having personal knowledge of the facts which is\n\notherwise. Burden is cast on the plaintiff to prove that said\n\nwitness had either personal knowledge or he was informed\n\nby any one of the signatories to Exhibit 194 about the facts\n\nof which he has deposing. None of these are present in the\n\ninstant case. In his examination-in-chief dated 26.09.2000,\n\nhe has deposed to the following effect :\n\n \"I was doing part-time job in Chhaganlal & Co. in the\n year 1973 and in this manner I was connected with the\n said company. Mr.Chhaganlal Girdharlal Patel is the\n main partner of Chhaganlal & Co. I know him very well.\n I saw him writing frequently when I was doing part-time\n job in Chhaganlal & Co. and therefore, I know his\n signature well.\"\n\n89. Thus, the witness examined on behalf of plaintiff who\n\nwas an employee of Chhaganlal & Co. had no authority to\n\ndepose on behalf of the plaintiff society. That apart, there\n\nis no authorization given by the plaintiff society to\n\nMr.Babulal to depose on behalf of the plaintiff society.\n\nThere is no resolution passed by the plaintiff society\n\nauthorizing Mr.Babulal to depose before the Court. There\n\nis absolutely no material to show that Mr.Babulal was a\n\nmember of the plaintiff society or he was the Chairman of\n\n Page 111 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthe plaintiff society. There is no material placed by the\n\nplaintiff to establish that as on 1974 when Exhibit 194\n\ncame into existence, Mr.Babulal was a member of the\n\nplaintiff society. On the other hand, the admission in the\n\nexamination-in-chief dated 26.04.2000 which is extracted\n\nhereinabove would suggest that as on 1973, he was doing\n\npart-time job in Chhaganlal & Co. (Defendant No.14)\n\n90. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Man\n\nKaur (Dead) by Lrs. vs. Hartar Singh Sangha, reported\n\nin (2010) 10 SCC 512, has held that where a party to the\n\nsuit does not appear in the witness-box and states his own\n\ncase on oath and does not offer himself to be cross-\n\nexamined by the other side, a presumption would arise\n\nthat the case set up by him is not correct. It is also held\n\nthat only the person with personal knowledge of details of\n\ntransaction can depose. It has been further held :\n\n \"17. To succeed in a suit for specific performance,\n the plaintiff has to prove: (a) that a valid agreement of\n sale was entered by the defendant in his favour and the\n terms thereof; (b) that the defendant committed breach\n of the contract; and (c) that he was always ready and\n willing to perform his part of the obligations in terms of\n the contract. If a plaintiff has to prove that he was\n\n Page 112 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n always ready and willing to perform his part of the\n contract, that is, to perform his obligations in terms of\n the contract, necessarily he should step into the witness\n box and give evidence that he has all along been ready\n and willing to perform his part of the contract and\n subject himself to cross examination on that issue. A\n plaintiff cannot obviously examine in his place, his\n attorney holder who did not have personal knowledge\n either of the transaction or of his readiness and\n willingness. Readiness and willingness refer to the state\n of mind and conduct of the purchaser, as also his\n capacity and preparedness on the other. One without the\n other is not sufficient. Therefore a third party who has\n no personal knowledge cannot give evidence about such\n readiness and willingness, even if he is an attorney\n holder of the person concerned.\n\n 18. We may now summarise for convenience, the\n position as to who should give evidence in regard to\n matters involving personal knowledge:\n\n (a) An attorney holder who has signed the plaint and\n instituted the suit, but has no personal knowledge of\n the transaction can only give formal evidence about the\n validity of the power of attorney and the filing of the\n suit.\n\n (b) If the attorney holder has done any act or\n handled any transactions, in pursuance of the power of\n attorney granted by the principal, he may be examined\n as a witness to prove those acts or transactions. If the\n attorney holder alone has personal knowledge of such\n acts and transactions and not the principal, the\n attorney holder shall be examined, if those acts and\n transactions have to be proved.\n\n (c) The attorney holder cannot depose or give evidence\n in place of his principal for the acts done by the\n principal or transactions or dealings of the principal, of\n which principal alone has personal knowledge.\n\n (d) Where the principal at no point of time had\n personally handled or dealt with or participated in the\n transaction and has no personal knowledge of the\n transaction, and where the entire transaction has been\n handled by an attorney holder, necessarily the attorney\n holder alone can give evidence in regard to the\n\n Page 113 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n transaction. This frequently happens in case of\n principals carrying on business through authorized\n managers/attorney holders or persons residing abroad\n managing their affairs through their attorney holders.\n\n (e) Where the entire transaction has been conducted\n through a particular attorney holder, the principal has\n to examine that attorney holder to prove the\n transaction, and not a different or subsequent attorney\n holder.\n\n (f) Where different attorney holders had dealt with the\n matter at different stages of the transaction, if evidence\n has to be led as to what transpired at those different\n stages, all the attorney holders will have to be\n examined.\n\n (g) Where the law requires or contemplated the plaintiff\n or other party to a proceeding, to establish or prove\n something with reference to his `state of mind' or\n `conduct', normally the person concerned alone has to\n give evidence and not an attorney holder. A landlord\n who seeks eviction of his tenant, on the ground of his\n `bona fide' need and a purchaser seeking specific\n performance who has to show his `readiness and\n willingness' fall under this category. There is however a\n recognized exception to this requirement. Where all the\n affairs of a party are completely managed, transacted\n and looked after by an attorney (who may happen to be a\n close family member), it may be possible to accept the\n evidence of such attorney even with reference to bona\n fides or `readiness and willingness'. Examples of such\n attorney holders are a husband/wife exclusively\n managing the affairs of his/her spouse, a son/daughter\n exclusively managing the affairs of an old and infirm\n parent, a father/mother exclusively managing the affairs\n of a son/daughter living abroad.\"\n\n91. The witness who had been examined on behalf of\n\nthe plaintiff Mr.Babulal having no personal knowledge of\n\nthe transaction (Exhibit 194) cannot be held to be a person\n\nwho knew as to what transpired when the Agreement of\n\n Page 114 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nSale Exhibit 194 came into existence. Hence, the\n\ncontention raised by the plaintiff that it had proved the\n\ncontents of Exhibit 194 also cannot be digested and it has\n\nto be rejected.\n\n92. As could be seen from the judgment and decree\n\nof the trial Court, the suit has been dismissed essentially\n\non the following grounds :\n\n (i) Non-availability of permission from\n Charity Commissioner;\n\n (ii) Permission not obtained from ULC\n authorities;\n\n (iii) All trustees have not signed the agreement\n of sale dated 27.12.1974 (Exhibit 194);\n\n (iv) Readiness and willingness has not been\n shown or exhibited by plaintiff;\n\n (v) Possession of the suit schedule property is\n not with the plaintiff or plaintiff has failed\n to prove said claim.\n\n93. One of the prime contention raised by both the\n\nsides is that on account of permission from the Charity\n\n Page 115 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nCommissioner has not been obtained, the agreement to\n\nsell Exhibit 194 cannot be enforced. In fact in the written\n\nstatement filed by defendant Nos. 1 to 4 and 6, it has\n\nbeen contended in paragraph 12 that defendant had filed\n\nsuch application before the Charity Commissioner and it\n\nwas rejected. It was also specifically averred in the\n\nwritten statement to the following effect :\n\n \"12. With regard to para no. 4 ...xxxxx...\n corrospondence with the defendant. The defendant in\n this matter are public trust registered under the\n \nBombay Public Trusts Act\n and as per the provisions\n therein that obtaining legal permission to sell from the\n Government, they cannot sell such land to any private\n person and the plaintiff is aware of the fact very well\n and therefore, without obtaining such permission, the\n question of handing over peaceful possession does not\n arise. ..........xxxx.........\"\n\n94. Contention has also been raised in this regard\n\nin this Appeal also. Appeal being continuation of original\n\nproceedings and though there is no much discussion on\n\nthis aspect by the learned trial Judge, we have examined\n\nthe same on this issue also. In order to adjudicate the\n\nsame, we are of the considered opinion that it would be\n\nnecessary to extract \nSection 36\n of the Gujarat Public\n\nTrusts Act, 1950, as applicable, and it reads as under : -\n\n Page 116 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n \"36. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the\n instrument of trust--\n\n (a) no sale, mortgage, exchange or gift or any\n immovable property, and\n\n (b) no lease for a period exceeding ten years in\n the case of agricultural land or for a period exceeding\n three years in the case of non-agricultural land or a\n building.\n\n belonging to a public trust, shall be valid without the\n previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner.\n\n (2) The decision of the Charity Commissioner under\n sub-section (1) shall be communicated to the trustees\n and shall be published in such manner as may be\n prescribed.\n\n (3) Any person aggrieved by such decision may appeal\n to the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal within thirty days from\n the date of its publication.\n\n (4) Such decision shall, subject to the provisions of sub-\n section (3) be final.\"\n\n95. Mr. Yatin Oza, learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for appellant has contended that even if\n\npermission sought for has been rejected, conditional\n\ndecree can be passed and has pressed into service the\n\nFull Bench Judgment of this Court in the case of \nShah\n\nJitendra Nanalal Ahmedabad vs. Patel Lallubhai\n\nIshverbhai Ahmedabad and Ors.\n AIR 1984 Guj. 145.\n\nA perusal of this judgmetn would indicate that in the case\n\nof Shah Jitendra, the Full Bench had formulated question\n\n Page 117 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nno. 2 in the background of facts obtained therein and had\n\nopined as under : -\n\n \"13. In this view, in answer to the second question\n referred to us we hold that a conditional decree for\n specific performance subject to exemption being\n obtained under \nsection 20\n of the Urban Land (Ceiling\n and Regulation) Act, 1976 (Act No. 33 of 1976) is\n permissible. As we have said earlier, we do not propose\n to answer the first question as it may not be necessary.\n The case will be sent back.\"\n\n96. As could be seen from the above judgment, it\n\nhas been held that such conditional decree can be passed\n\nsubject to exemption being obtained under \nsection 20\n of\n\nthe Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (since\n\nrepealed). However, as on date of the suit \nULC Act\n was\n\nin force and even applying the said principle, it would not\n\ndetain us for too long to brush aside the contention\n\nraised by learned Senior Advocate Mr. Yatin Oza for the\n\nreasons more than one; the words and expression found\n\nin Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 36 commences\n\nwith non-obstante clause namely with expression \"no\n\nsale, mortgage, exchange or gift of any immovable\n\nproperty\", would be valid without the previous sanction\n\nof the Charity Commissioner, if such immovable property\n\n Page 118 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nbelongs to a Public Trust.\n\n97. In the instant case, the permission sought for\n\nhad been rejected even according to plaintiff. The sole\n\nwitness examined on behalf of plaintiff in his evidence\n\nrecorded on 26.04.2000, has stated to the following\n\neffect:\n\n \"the trustees of the defendant trust applied to the\n Charity Commissioner for permission to sell claimed\n land. Copy of submitted application is represented at\n Exhibit 129/34. Application is signed by trustees. The\n application Number is 36/8/80.\"\n\n98. He has also deposed that an application under\n\nsection 20\n of the ULC Act had been filed seeking\n\nexemption. Nowhere he has stated that permission from\n\nULC had been granted. Even otherwise according to\n\ncontention raised by respective learned advocates\n\nappearing for parties, the Charity Commissioner rejected\n\nthe permission on 26.02.1986. Against which, two\n\nRevision Applications were filed. The revision application\n\nfiled by trust challenging the rejection order came to be\n\ndismissed as withdrawn. One Mr. Banwarlal Amrutlal\n\n Page 119 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nParikh, challenged the order of rejection passed by\n\nCharity Commissioner, resulted in its dismissal on merits\n\non 13.06.2001. This was challenged in Special Civil\n\nApplication No. 7360 of 2001, which has been dismissed\n\non 12.03.2003. Certified copy of the order dated\n\n13.06.2001 passed by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal in\n\nAppeal No. TEN AA 33/1986 has been produced along\n\nwith Civil Application No. 1 of 2015 (Old Civil Application\n\nNo. 7389 of 2015), which has been allowed by order of\n\neven date, to be received as additional evidence and\n\nmarked as Exhibit 223, it would clearly indicate that\n\norder passed by the Charity Commissioner on 26.02.1986\n\nwas affirmed. The copy of order dated 12.03.2003 passed\n\nin Special Civil Application No. 7360 of 2001 produced\n\nalong with Civil Application No. 1 of 2016 (at page 50\n\ntherein) would clearly indicate that the order of Tribunal\n\ndated 13.06.2001 has also been affirmed.\n\n99. In other words, the order of rejection passed by\n\nCharity Commissioner had attained finality or to put it\n\ndifferently, there is no order passed by the Charity\n\n Page 120 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nCommissioner as required under section 36 for\n\npermitting the sale of suit schedule property by the first\n\ndefendant trust which is a Public Charitable Trust.\n\n100. The Full Bench of the High Court of Mumbai in\n\nthe case of Avinash Kishorchand Jaiswal and Another\n\nvs. Shri Rammandi Deosthan, Pavnar and Others,\n\nreported in 2020 (3) Mh. L.J. 323, has held that\n\nprevious sanction of the Charity Commissioner for sale of\n\nproperty belonging to trust is mandatory and any\n\nalienation of trust property without the same is null and\n\nvoid. It has been held as under :-\n\n \"8. In our view, the requirement of obtaining\n previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner under\n Section 36(1)(a) of the said Act to sell or alienate the\n immovable property belonging to a public trust is\n mandatory and the power can be exercised only on the\n application made under Section 36(1)(c) by a trust or\n the trustees, seeking authorization to dispose of such\n property. Any sale or alienation of an immovable\n property of the public trust without such sanction is\n null and void. While deciding such application, the\n Charity Commissioner has to have regard to the\n interest, benefit and the protection of the trust. The\n power cannot be exercised suo motu or on his own by\n the Charity Commissioner. The power to grant sanction\n includes power to refuse sanction on the ground that it\n is not in the interest and benefit of the trust and that\n the property needs to be protected.\"\n\n101. In the background of suit schedule property\n\n Page 121 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nbeing public trust property and both the parties namely\n\nplaintiff and defendant (some of them) being ad idem on\n\nthis had sought permission from the Charity\n\nCommissioner to sell the suit schedule property. Even\n\naccording to the plaintiff, application had been made by\n\ntrustees of defendant No.1 trust way back in the year\n\n1980. The said application though produced along with\n\nthe plaint with Mark 129/34 but not marked as exhibit\n\nwould clearly indicate that for sale of suit schedule\n\nproperty, permission had to be obtained from the Charity\n\nCommissioner. The said permission had been sought for\n\nand had been rejected by the Charity Commissioner vide\n\norder dated 26.2.1986, confirmed by the Tribunal by\n\norder dated 13.6.2001 (Exhibit 223) and affirmed in\n\nSpecial Civil Application No.7360 of 2001 vide order\n\ndated 12.3.2003. Hence, we are of the considered view\n\nthat the principle enunciated by the Full Bench in \nShah\n\nJitendra\n's case referred to supra would be inapplicable as\n\nin the said case, it was a claim simpliciter for grant of\n\ndecree of specific specific performance even when such\n\n Page 122 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\npermission having sought for had been refused.\n\n102. Even assuming that the said principle as\n\nenunciated by the Full Bench of this Court is to be\n\naccepted, we are of the considered view that it would be\n\napplicable or operate in a situation where there is no\n\npermission sought for and such permission having not\n\nbeen refused. In a given case where the trust or any one\n\nelse on behalf of the trust who were to apply for grant of\n\npermission under \nSection 36\n of the Bombay Public Trusts\n\nAct, 1950 and such permission is refused, in such\n\ncircumstances, it cannot be gainsaid that the conditional\n\ndecree can be passed. This proposition also gets support\n\nfrom the authoritative pronouncement of the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in the case of \nM. Meenakshi and Others\n\nvs. Metadin Agarwal (Dead) By LRs and Others\n\n[(2006) 7 SCC 470].\n\n103. In the instant case, agreement of sale dated\n\n27.12.1974 Exhibit 194 has relied upon by plaintiff for\n\nthe relief of specific performance against the defendant,\n\n Page 123 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\non account of alleged defendants refusal to execute the\n\nsale deed. A perusal of the said agreement would clearly\n\nindicate that it has been entered into between plaintiff\n\nsociety and 14th defendant. Said agreement has been\n\nexecuted on behalf of society by its Chairman Mr.Patel\n\nManilal Atmaram (who has not entered the witness-\n\nbox). The vendor i.e. 14th defendant who is said to have\n\nexecuted the said agreement in favour of the plaintiff is\n\non the strength of agreement of sale dated 13.11.1973,\n\nwhich has been produced at Mark 193/1. However, same\n\nwas not exhibited as already noticed hereinabove. It is\n\nagreed under the said agreement that permission of the\n\nCharity Commissioner to sell the suit schedule property\n\nhas to be obtained by the \"Owner\". This agreement is\n\nsaid to have been signed by the partner of M/s.\n\nChhaganlal & Co. and also witnessed by Mr.Mukundbhai\n\nChimanlal Shah and Mr.Gangarao Bhaskarrao Pavde on\n\nbehalf of M/s.Jalpa Traders. However, none of them have\n\nbeen examined in the instant case. The agreement of sale\n\nmarked as Exhibit 194 has been appended with two\n\n Page 124 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nadditional sheets and the purported first endorsement\n\ndated 18.4.1976 is said to have been signed by the\n\ntrustees of 1st defendant. However, the records do not\n\ndisclose as to who are all trustees of the first defendant\n\ntrust at the relevant point of time. On this issue, we\n\nwould be dealing at a later stage. Turning our attention\n\nback to the core issue, namely non-obtaining of the\n\npermission from the Charity Commissioner is concerned,\n\nwe notice undisputedly the owner of the suit schedule\n\nproperty (1st defendant) had to obtain permission from\n\nCharity Commissioner to sell the suit land and in the\n\nwritten statement filed by defendants 1 to 4 and 6, it has\n\nbeen specifically contended by them that no such prior\n\npermission had been obtained by defendant trust.\n\nPlaintiff's witness in his further examination-in-chief\n\nrecorded on 29.03.2000 has also admitted this fact which\n\nis to the following effect :\n\n \"The plaintiff society xxxx land in question. As per the\n terms of the said agreement, necessary permissions, in\n order to get final sale deed registered, were required to\n be obtained by the defendants. The defendants had\n not obtained or made an application to get the\n necessary permission which were required to be\n\n Page 125 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n obtained. Therefore, I had requested the defendants\n to obtain necessary permissions and after obtaining the\n same, to get the final sale deed registered, but the\n defendants did not take any action to obtain\n permissions. And if any such action has been done,\n the defendants had not made me aware thereof. If the\n defendants xxxx willing for the same.\" (Emphasis\n supplied by us)\n\n104. He has also deposed that trustees of the 1 st\n\ndefendant trust had submitted an application to the\n\nCharity Commissioner to sell the suit schedule property\n\nas per the application vide Mark-129/34 and they had also\n\nfiled a declaration before the ULC authorities as per\n\napplication Mark-129/35. However, for reasons best\n\nknown both these documents were not marked as an\n\nexhibit. The application marked as 129/34 is a photocopy\n\nof the application submitted to the Charity Commissioner\n\nand is said to have been signed by the trustees of 1 st\n\ndefendant trust (not all trustees) seeking for exemption.\n\nLearned advocates appearing for both parties admit that\n\napplication filed before the Charity Commissioner on\n\n27.10.1970 (not exhibited) came to be rejected by the\n\nCharity Commissioner vide order dated 26.02.1986,\n\nagainst which the trust filed a revision application and\n\n Page 126 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nsame was dismissed as withdrawn. Being aggrieved by\n\nthe order of rejection, Mr.Banvarilal Amrutlal Parikh had\n\nfiled a revision application in Appeal No.TEN AA 33/1996\n\nwhich came to be dismissed on merits on 13.06.2001 -\n\nExhibit 223, whereunder it had been observed to the\n\nfollowing effect :\n\n \"10. The learned advocate for the respondent xxxx\n before the Charity Commissioner. The person who is\n the proposed purchaser from the trust has no locus\n standi before the Charity Commissioner. The only\n aggrieved person can be the trust and in this case, the\n trust no longer wishes to proceed with the same. The\n trust had filed a revision application 35 of 1986 before\n this Tribunal. This has been withdrawn by the trust.\n Consequently, the trust is no longer having any\n grievance against the order of the Charity\n Commissioner.\"\n\n105. It has also been observed by the Tribunal that\n\nfrom the papers available on record, it is not evident as to\n\nwhy the properties of the trust are required to be\n\ndisposed of and how the proceeds of the same would be\n\nutilized for the benefit of the trust. It has been further\n\nobserved by the tribunal thus :\n\n \"18. It may be noted xxxx also has not succeeded. It\n may, therefore, be said that the matter is now once\n again wide open. It does not appear in the interest of\n the trust to give approval for the erstwhile agreements\n\n Page 127 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n made by the earlier trustees, because the interest of\n the trust and reasonableness of the proposals of the\n trust have not been fully explained. The need to dispose\n of the property has also to be fully examined. Under the\n circumstances, I find that the order of the Charity\n Commissioner is quite proper and should not be\n interfered with. I therefore xxxx order.\"\n\nThis would clearly indicate that permission to sell the suit\n\nschedule property sought for was not granted by the\n\nCharity Commissioner and order of rejection had attained\n\nfinality.\n\n106. Appellant - plaintiff has also made an attempt\n\nto produce certain documents during the pendency of this\n\nappeal by way of additional evidence, contending it has\n\ncome into existence after the judgment and decree\n\npassed by the trial Court and during the pendency of the\n\npresent appeal and said documents have a bearing on the\n\nfacts of the present case. Even accepting the same for a\n\nmoment and for the limited purpose of looking into the\n\ndocuments annexed to CA No.6 of 2022 it would clearly\n\nemerge therefrom that the Charity Commissioner\n\nrejected the application No.36/59/2003 said to have been\n\nfiled by four trustees and said application having been\n\n Page 128 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndismissed vide order dated 31.01.2004. The application\n\nfiled for such permission was on 17.04.2001 and it would\n\nindicate that same was filed on account of the proposed\n\ncompromise to be entered into in the appeal, whereunder\n\nthey had sought permission to sell the suit schedule\n\nproperty. However, said application also came to be\n\ndismissed on 31.01.2004. Thus, it would emerge from the\n\nrecords that undisputedly there was no permission\n\naccorded by the Charity Commissioner to sell the suit\n\nland in favour of plaintiff.\n\n107. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nNarayamma and others vs. Govindappa and others -\n\n(2019) 19 SCC 42 has held if a decree were to be\n\ngranted in favour of the plaintiff on the basis of an illegal\n\nagreement which is hit by statute, it will be rendering an\n\nactive assistance by the Court in enforcing an agreement\n\nwhich is contrary to law. It has been further held :\n\n \"20. It could thus be seen that, although illegality is not\n pleaded by the defendant nor is relied upon by him by\n way of defence, yet the court itself, upon the illegality\n appearing upon the evidence, will take notice of it, and\n will dismiss the action ex turpi causa non oritur actio. It\n\n Page 129 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n has been held, that no polluted hand shall touch the\n pure fountain of justice. It has further been held, that\n where parties are concerned in illegal agreements or\n other transactions, courts of equity following the rule of\n law as to participators in common crime will not\n interpose to grant any relief, acting upon the maxim in\n pari delicto potior est conditio defendetis et\n possidentis.\n\n *** *** ***\n\n \n28. Now, let us apply the another test laid down in the\n case of \nImmani Appa Rao\n (supra). At the cost of\n repetition, both the parties are common participator in\n the illegality. In such a situation, the balance of justice\n would tilt in whose favour is the question.\n \nAs held in\n \nImmani Appa Rao\n (supra), if the decree is granted in\n favour of the plaintiff on the basis of an illegal\n agreement which is hit by a statute, it will be rendering\n an active assistance of the court in enforcing an\n agreement which is contrary to law. As against this, if\n the balance is tilted towards the defendants, no doubt\n that they would stand benefited even in spite of their\n predecessor-in-title committing an illegality. However,\n what the court would be doing is only rendering an\n assistance which is purely of a passive character.\n \nAs\n held by Gajendragadkar, J. in \nImmani Appa Rao\n\n (supra), the first course would be clearly and patently\n inconsistent with the public interest whereas, the latter\n course is lesser injurious to public interest than the\n former.\"\n\n108. Any sale of an immovable property belonging to\n\na public trust would be void ab-initio if sold without\n\npermission of Charity Commissioner as held by this Court\n\nin the case of Prabodhkumari Maganbhai Patel vs.\n\nModasa Kadva Patidar - 2010 (4) GLR 3562,\n\nwhereunder it has been held :\n\n \"15. At the outset, it is required to be noted and it is\n an admitted position that the suit property is the\n\n Page 130 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n property of Public Trust, Shri Modasa Kadva Patidar\n Trust at Modasa, District: Sabarkantha which is a Trust\n registered under the \nBombay Public Trusts Act\n. The\n aforesaid Public Trust was running the Boarding in the\n suit property in question and there was an open space\n on the front side of the Boarding upon which, the shops\n in question have been constructed and they are in\n occupation and in possession of the respective\n petitioners herein. Respective petitioners claim to be in\n possession of the disputed shops in question as alleged\n and claiming through respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein\n as Trustees of the Trust. It is the case on behalf of the\n respective petitioners that respondent Nos. 2 and 3\n herein as Trustees of aforesaid Trust have leased the\n shops in question to the respective petitioners thereby,\n they have become the tenant of the suit shops in\n question. That as the property in question belongs to\n the Trust registered under the \nBombay Public Trusts\n Act\n, it is subject to restrictions/provisions under the\n \nBombay Public Trusts Act\n. \nSection 36\n of the Bombay\n Public Trusts Act creates a clear embargo/bar of\n transferring in any manner whatsoever the Trust\n property without prior sanction of the Charity\n Commissioner.\n\n \nSection 36\n of the Bombay Public Trusts Act reads as\n under:\n\n 36[(1)] [Notwithstanding anything contained in the\n instrument of trust -]\n\n (a) no sale, mortgage, exchange or gift or any\n immovable property, and\n\n (b) no lease for a period exceeding ten years in the case\n of agricultural land or for a period exceeding three\n years in the case of non-agricultural land or a building,\n belonging to a public trust, shall be valid without the\n previous sanction of the Charity Commissioner.\n\n [(2) The decision of the Charity Commissioner under\n sub-section (1) shall be communicated to the trustees\n and shall be published in such manner as may be\n prescribed.\n\n (3) Any person aggrieved by such decision may appeal\n to the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal within thirty days from\n the date of its publication.\n\n (4) Such decision shall, subject to the provisions of sub-\n section (3) be final.]\n\n Page 131 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n Therefore any sale, mortgage, exchange or gift of any\n immovable property and/or lease for a period\n exceeding 3 years in the case of non-agricultural land\n or a building belonging to a public trust is void ab\n initio. As held by this Court in the case of Huseinmiya\n Safimiya v. Habibsha Hasamsha Fakir reported in 1985\n (2) GLR 928 any alienation of the immovable property\n of the public trust without express permission of the\n Charity Commissioner as required under \nSection 36\n of\n the Act shall be invalid and is void and not binding to\n the Trust. Similar view has been expressed by this\n Court in the case of Pratik Medicines v. Board of\n Management reported in 2005 (2) GLH (UJ) 15 Page 26\n and it is held that lease of the Trust property without\n prior permission of the Charity Commissioner is void ab\n initio. In the present case, admittedly, before alleged\n lease in favour of the respective petitioners admittedly\n prior permission of the Charity Commissioner is not\n obtained. On the contrary permission under \nSection 36\n\n of the Act has specifically refused by the Charity\n Commissioner. Under the circumstances, alleged lease\n in favour of the respective petitioners is nullity and void\n ab initio. It is required to be noted that in the present\n case, not only there is no prior permission of the\n Charity Commissioner before the alleged lease in\n favour of the respective petitioners, there was already\n an application submitted by the respondent Nos. 2 and\n 3 alleged to be the Trustees at the relevant time when\n the shops in question were leased and submitted the\n application before the Charity Commissioner under\n \nSection 36\n of the Act for post-facto permission and to\n regularize the lease in favour of the respective\n petitioners and the Charity Commissioner has\n dismissed the said application and refused to regularize\n the lease in favour of the respective petitioners and\n refused to grant post-facto permission under \nSection 36\n\n of the Act. It is required to be noted that before the\n Charity Commissioner, the respective petitioners were\n also heard. It is also required to be noted that there\n were objections filed by the respondent Nos. 4 to 11\n who were the Trustees of the Trust and direction was\n sought and the learned Charity Commissioner has\n while rejecting the application submitted by the\n respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein claiming to be the\n Trustees of the Trust at the relevant time when there\n was a lease in favour of the respondent petitioners, has\n\n Page 132 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n specifically observed that respondent Nos. 2 and 3\n through whom the petitioners are claiming the lease in\n their favour and inducted the petitioners, were not the\n trustees of the Trust. There is a specific finding given\n by the Charity Commissioner that respondent Nos. 2\n and 3 who have alleged to have leased the shops in\n question in favour of the petitioners had no authority to\n lease the suit property belonging to the public trust.\n That the learned Charity Commissioner after hearing\n the parties not only dismissed the application\n submitted for post facto permission under \nSection 36\n of\n the Act but has also allowed the objections submitted\n by the respondent Nos. 4 to 11 herein Trustees of the\n Trust and has directed the Trustees of the Trust to get\n back the possession after following due process and\n report to the Charity Commissioner within 60 (sixty)\n days. It is required to be noted that the order passed by\n the Charity Commissioner was challenged by the\n respective petitioners before the Gujarat Revenue\n Tribunal by way of revision application and the said\n revision application is dismissed and the order passed\n by the Charity Commissioner has become final.\n\n Thus the alleged lease in favour of the respective\n petitioners is not only hit by \nSection 36\n of the Bombay\n Public Trusts Act and is a nullity and void ab initio but\n as observed by the Charity Commissioner, the same\n was by the persons i.e respondent Nos. 2 and 3 who\n were not the Trustees on the PTR of the Trust and that\n they had no Authority to lease shops in\n question/premises in question on behalf of the Trust.\n Therefore, the rights of the respective parties have\n been adjudicated upon by the Charity Commissioner\n who is the only Competent Authority under the\n provisions of the \nBombay Public Trusts Act\n. Under the\n scheme and provisions of the Bombay Pubic Trusts Act,\n Charity Commissioner is the only Competent Authority\n to decide the dispute with respect to the property of\n the public trust.\n\n 18. Now to appreciate the aforesaid submissions, it is\n required to be noted that admittedly, the property in\n question belong to the public trust. For any dispute\n with respect to the property belonging to the public\n Trust only Charity Commissioner has the jurisdiction\n under the Bombay Public Trust Act. Not only that but\n even with respect to the lease of the property\n\n Page 133 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n belonging to the public trust, prior sanction of the\n Charity Commissioner is must as required under\n \nSection 36\n of the Act. Except the Charity\n Commissioner, no other Authority or Court has any\n jurisdiction with respect to the Trust property. As per\n \nSection 80\n of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, no Civil\n Court has jurisdiction to decide and deal with any\n question which is by or under \nPublic Trust Act\n to be\n decided or dealt with by any officer or authority under\n the \nBombay Public Trusts Act\n or in respect of which\n decision or order such officer or authority has been\n made final and conclusive.\"\n\n109. A plain reading of \nSection 36\n of BPT Act would\n\nindicate that for sale of property owned by a public trust\n\nthe condition precedent is previous sanction. Hence, ex-\n\npost facto sanction cannot be obtained after the sale\n\ntransaction as it is not a sanction in the eye of law and it\n\nwould not be valid. Such grant of prior sanction is not\n\ntechnical or procedural, but it affects the very right of the\n\ntrust and the public who have interest in the suit\n\nproperty. Hence, the agreement of sale cannot be valid\n\nunless there is a previous sanction. In fact the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in the case of Minakshi and other vs.\n\nMetadin Agarwal reported in (2006) 7 SCC 470 has\n\nheld conditional decree cannot be granted when the\n\npermission is applied and rejected. It has been further\n\n Page 134 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nheld:\n\n \"17. The competent authority under the 1976 Act\n was not impleaded as a party in the suit. The orders\n passed by the competent authority therein could not\n have been the subject-matter thereof. The Plaintiff\n although being a person aggrieved could have\n questioned the validity of the said orders, did not chose\n to do so. Even if the orders passed by the competent\n authorities were bad in law, they were required to be\n set aside in an appropriate proceeding. They were not\n the subject matter of the said suit and the validity or\n otherwise of the said proceeding could not have been\n gone into therein and in any event for the first time in\n the Letters Patent Appeal.\n\n \n39. Furthermore, \nSection 20\n of the Specific Relief\n Act confers a discretionary jurisdiction upon the courts.\n Undoubtedly such a jurisdiction cannot be refused to\n be exercised on whims and caprice; but when with\n passage of time, contract becomes frustrated or in\n some cases increase in the price of land takes place,\n the same being relevant factors can be taken into\n consideration for the said purpose. While refusing to\n exercise its jurisdiction, the courts are not precluded\n from taking into consideration the subsequent events.\n Only because the Plaintiff-Respondents are ready and\n willing to perform their part of contract and even\n assuming that the Defendant was not entirely vigilant\n in protecting their rights in the proceedings before the\n competent authority under the 1976 Act, the same by\n itself would not mean that a decree for specific\n performance of contract would automatically be\n granted. While considering the question as to whether\n the discretionary jurisdiction should be exercised or\n not, the orders of a competent authority must also be\n taken into consideration. While the court upon passing\n a decree for specific performance of contract is entitled\n to direct that the same shall be subject to the grant of\n sanction by the concerned authority, as was the case in\n \nMrs. Chandnee Vidya Vati Madden v. Dr. C.L. Katilal\n and Others\n [AIR 1964 SC 978] and Nirmal Anand v.\n Advent Corporation (P) Ltd. And Others [(2002) 5 SCC\n 481]; the ratio laid down therein cannot be extended to\n a case where prayer for such sanction had been prayed\n for and expressly rejected. On the face of such order,\n\n Page 135 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n which, as noticed hereinbefore, is required to be set\n aside by a court in accordance with law, a decree for\n specific performance of contract could not have been\n granted.\"\n\n110. In the instant case the order of the Charity\n\nCommissioner rejecting the application filed under\n\nsection 36\n of the Act came to be passed on 26.02.1996\n\nwhich has been confirmed by the Gujarat Revenue\n\nTribunal on 13.06.2001 (Exhibit 223) and order of the\n\nTribunal has also been confirmed by the learned Single\n\nJudge of this Court in SCA 7360 of 2001 and as such it\n\ncannot be gainsaid by the appellant that notwithstanding\n\nthe orders of the Charity Commissioner refusing to grant\n\npermission to sell the suit schedule property either prior\n\nto entering into agreement to sell or during the pendency\n\nof these proceedings, yet a conditional decree of specific\n\nperformance can be passed. Said contention is without\n\nmerit and it is liable to be rejected and accordingly, it\n\nstands rejected. In the light of said finding recorded by\n\nus, the judgments relied upon by Mr.Yatin Oza, learned\n\nSenior Counsel appearing for the appellant would not\n\ncome to the rescue of the appellant.\n\n Page 136 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n111. Another ground on which the learned Trial\n\nJudge has refused to grant the specific performance of\n\nthe agreement to sell dated 27.12.1974 - Exhibit 194 is\n\non the ground that all the trustees of the 1 st defendant\n\ntrust have not affixed their signatures.\n\n112. It is an undisputed fact that Exhibit 194 has\n\nbeen entered into between plaintiff and 14 th defendant. It\n\nis also the contention of plaintiff that agreement of sale\n\nexecuted by 14th defendant in favour of the plaintiff as per\n\nExhibit-194 have been ratified by the 1st defendant and its\n\ntrustees and as such 1st defendant trust and its trustees\n\ndefendant Nos. 2 to 8 bound by it. The plea raised by\n\nplaintiff in this regard is traceable to paragraph 1 of the\n\nplaint, which is to the following effect :\n\n \"1. The plaintiff society xxxx by the defendants. All\n the defendants have executed their writings over the\n agreement to sell dated 27.12.1974. Thereafter, xxxx\n hereinbelow.\"\n\n113. In the written statement filed by defendant\n\nNos. 1 to 4 and 6, it has been specifically contended that\n\n Page 137 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndefendants had earlier entered into an agreement to sell\n\nthe suit property with Shri Pramukhlal and Shri Ambalal,\n\nwho in turn had entered into another Banakhat -\n\nAgreement to Sell on 21.09.1970 in favour of Shri\n\nGangaram Pavde and in the said agreement all the\n\ntrustees have not signed. It was further pleaded that in\n\nthe agreement of sale entered into between the 1 st\n\ndefendant trust with Shri Pramukhlal and Shri Ambalal, it\n\ndid not contain the signature of Mr.Ambalal. The\n\ndefendants have specifically denied of Mr.Gangaram\n\nPavde having assigned his rights in favour of M/s.Jalpa\n\nTraders under agreement dated 03.04.1977. It was also\n\nspecifically pleaded that agreement to sell the suit\n\nschedule property on 08.05.1972 has been entered into\n\nby one trustee only in favour of Jalpa Traders and\n\nadmittedly the said agreement did not contain the\n\nsignatures of all the trustees and the burden which was\n\ncast on the plaintiff to prove that the sole trustee\n\nMr.Kunjbihari Madhavlal Bhagwat having been\n\nauthorized by all other trustees has not been proved or in\n\n Page 138 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nother words, this factual aspect has remained in vacuum.\n\nMr. Yatin Oza, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants has contended that Mr. Kunjbiharilal\n\nMadhavlal Bhagwat was acting on behalf of all the\n\ntrustees and he was authorised to sign all the documents\n\non behalf of the trust and as such he has affixed the\n\nsignature to the agreements and various applications filed\n\nbefore the statutory authorities. Hence, he contends that\n\nnon-signing of the agreement of sale Exhibit 194 or any\n\nother document by all other trustees would not erase the\n\nvalue of Exhibit 194 or in other words, it can be enforced\n\nagainst defendant No.1 trust. Such contention cannot be\n\naccepted for reasons more than one. Firstly, there is no\n\nproof of Kunjbiharilal Madhavlal Bhagwat alone being\n\nauthorised to act on behalf of defendant No.1 trust.\n\nExcept said point having been canvassed during the\n\ncourse of arguments. In fact, there is no plea also raised\n\nin this regard. The witness examined on behalf of plaintiff\n\nalso does not whisper a word on this issue. In the absence\n\nof any cogent material tendered by the plaintiff in this\n\n Page 139 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nregard, the contention of Mr. Yatin Oza, learned Senior\n\nCounsel cannot be accepted. \nIn the absence of pleadings,\n\nno amount of evidence will assist the parties as held by\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nBiraji Alias\n\nBrijraji and another vs. Surya Pratap and others\n\n[(2020) 10 SCC 729] whereunder it came to be held to\n\nthe following effect:\n\n \"8. Having heard the learned counsels on both sides,\n we have perused the impugned orders and other\n material placed on record. The suit in Original Suit No.\n 107/2010 is filed for cancellation of registered adoption\n deed and for consequential injunction orders. In the\n adoption deed itself, the ceremony which had taken\n place on 14.11.2001 was mentioned, hence it was\n within the knowledge of the appellants- plaintiffs even\n on the date of filing of the suit. In the absence of any\n pleading in the suit filed by the appellants, at belated\n stage, after evidence is closed, the appellants have filed\n the application to summon the record relating to leave/\n service of Ramesh Chander Singh on 14.11.2001 from\n the Rajput Regiment Centre Fatehgarh. It is fairly well\n settled that in absence of pleading, any amount of\n evidence will not help the party. When the adoption\n ceremony, which had taken place on 14.11.2001, is\n mentioned in the registered adoption deed, which was\n questioned in the suit, there is absolutely no reason for\n not raising specific plea in the suit and to file\n application at belated stage to summon the record to\n prove that the second respondent- Ramesh Chander\n Singh was on duty C.A.Nos.4883-4884 of 2017 as on\n 14.11.2001. There was an order from the High Court\n for expeditious disposal of the suit and the application\n which was filed belatedly is rightly dismissed by the\n Trial Court and confirmed by the Revisional Court and\n High Court.\"\n\n Page 140 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n114. Thus, it would emerge from the above\n\ndiscussion that :\n\n (i) The Agreement to Sell dated 21.09.1970\n\n said to have been executed by Jivanlal Parikh and\n\n the 1st defendant, all the trustees of the 1 st\n\n defendant had not affixed their signature or in\n\n other words, plaintiff has not proved the\n\n execution of said agreement or the said\n\n agreement having the signature of all the trustees\n\n of 1st defendant trust;\n\n (ii) In the agreement to sell dated 18.08.1966\n\n entered into between the 1st defendant with\n\n Pramukhlal Jivanlal Parikh and Ambalal Ishwarlal\n\n Prajapati the signature of Mr.Abmalal is not\n\n forthcoming;\n\n (iii) The agreement to sell dated 08.05.1972\n\n executed by Mr.Kunjbiharilal Madhavlal Bhagwat\n\n in favour of M/s.Jalpa Traders undisputedly did\n\n not contain the signatures of other trustees of the\n\n Page 141 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n 1st defendant trust.\n\n (iv) The plaintiff has failed to prove that\n\n Kunjbiharilal Madhavlal Bhagwat alone was\n\n empowered to act on behalf of the trust or he\n\n alone was empowered to execute the agreement\n\n to sell.\n\n115. Hence, in our considered opinion, the finding\n\nrecorded by the trial Court that plaintiff had failed to\n\nprove all the trustees of 1 st defendant trust have affixed\n\ntheir signatures to the agreement of sale dated\n\n24.12.1972 (Exhibit 194) as well as the prior agreements\n\nunder which the plaintiff is claiming right has also not\n\nbeen proved rightly so. In this background, it has to be\n\nnecessarily held that either ratification by the new\n\ntrustees of the sale agreement executed in favour of the\n\nplaintiff by either giving declaration or approving the\n\nsame through any means would be of no consequence. In\n\nthat view of the matter, contentions raised by the\n\nappellant in this regard cannot be accepted and it stands\n\n Page 142 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nrejected.\n\n116. The learned advocates appearing for the\n\ncontesting defendants have vehemently contended that\n\nthere is no averment made in the plaint with regard to\n\nreadiness and willingness and even in the event of this\n\nCourt arriving at a conclusion that reading of all the\n\naverments made in the plaint in toto would indicate such\n\naverments being there, then in such an event it has to be\n\nconstrued as a conditional plea and it ought not to be\n\naccepted. In fact the defendants 1 to 4 and 6 in their\n\nwritten statement at paragraph 14 have specifically\n\npleaded that plaintiff has never shown any willingness nor\n\nmade any demand.\n\n117. \nSection 16 (c)\n of the Specific Relief Act would\n\nindicate that specific performance of a contract cannot be\n\nenforced in favour of a person, if he fails to prove that he\n\nhas performed or has always been ready and willing to\n\nperform the essential terms of the contract which are to\n\nbe performed by him, other than terms the performance\n\n Page 143 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nof which he has been prevented or same has been waived\n\nby the defendant. The expression \"who fails to prove\" was\n\nsubstituted by Act 18 of 2018 and prior to the same the\n\nwords - expression \"must aver\" was found in \nSection\n\n16(c)\n. In other words, the expression \"must aver\" which\n\nexisted earlier was substituted by the words \"who fails to\n\nprove\". This amendment has come into effect from\n\n19.09.2018. Thus, it is incumbent upon party who wants\n\nto enforce the performance of a contract has to aver and\n\nprove that he has performed or has been always ready\n\nand willing to perform the essential terms of the contract.\n\nA plain ready of \nSection 16(c)\n of the Specific Relief Act\n\nmakes it absolutely clear, that plaintiff has to plead\n\nreadiness and willingness to perform the essential terms\n\nof the contract and it is a condition precedent for\n\nobtaining relief of specific performance. Plaintiff has to\n\nallege or aver and prove his \"continuous\" \"readiness and\n\nwillingness\" to perform his part of the contract from the\n\ndate of contract. Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nShenbagam and others vs. K.K.Rathinavel\n, reported\n\n Page 144 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nin 2022 LawSuit (SC) 62, has held : -\n\n \"29. We shall now advert to the respondent‟s conduct\n throughout the sale transaction. The respondent has\n failed to provide any documents or communication\n which would indicate that he called upon the appellants\n to perform their obligations or discharge the mortgage\n within the time period stipulated in the contract. Even\n after the expiry of the six months, the respondent did\n not reach out to the appellants. It is only in response to\n the appellants‟ legal notice that the respondent\n demanded performance of their obligations. Merely\n averring that he was waiting with the balance\n consideration and believed that the appellants would\n clear the encumbrance is insufficient to prove that the\n respondent-plaintiff was willing to perform his\n obligations under the contract.\"\n\n118. It would be of benefit to note the judgment of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of \nSyed Dastgir vs T.R.\n\nGopalkrishna Seatty\n [(1999) 6 SCC 337], whereunder\n\nit has been held that readiness and willingness to perform\n\nessential terms of the contract as required to be pleaded\n\nunder \nSection 16(c)\n, there cannot be any specific\n\nphraseology. It has been held :\n\n \"9. So the whole gamut of issue raised is, how to\n construe a plea specially with reference to \nSection\n 16(c)\n and what are the obligations which the plaintiff\n has to comply with reference to his plea and whether\n the plea of the plaintiff could not be construed to\n conform to the requirement of the aforesaid Section, or\n does this section require specific words to be pleaded\n that he has performed or has always been ready and is\n willing to perform his part of the contract. In\n construing a plea in any pleading, Courts must keep in\n\n Page 145 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n mind that a plea is not an expression of art and science\n but an expression through words to place fact and law\n of ones case for a relief. Such an expression may be\n pointed, precise, some times vague but still could be\n gathered what he wants to convey through only by\n reading the whole pleading, depends on the person\n drafting a plea. In India most of the pleas are drafted\n by counsels hence aforesaid difference of pleas which\n inevitably differ from one to other. Thus, to gather true\n spirit behind a plea it should be read as a whole. This\n does not distract one from performing his obligations\n as required under a statute. But to test, whether he has\n performed his obligations one has to see the pith and\n substance of a plea. Where a statute requires any fact\n to be pleaded then that has to be pleaded may be in\n any form. Same plea may be stated by different persons\n through different words then how could it be\n constricted to be only in any particular nomenclature\n or word. Unless statute specifically require for a plea to\n be in any particular form, it can be in any form. No\n specific phraseology or language is required to take\n such a plea. The language in \nSection 16(c)\n does not\n require any specific phraseology but only that the\n plaintiff must aver that he has performed or has always\n been and is willing to perform his part of the contract.\n So the compliance of Readiness and willingness has to\n be in spirit and substance and not in letter and form.\n So to insist for mechanical production of the exact\n words of an statute is to insist for the form rather than\n essence. So absence of form cannot dissolve an essence\n if already pleaded. \"\n\n119. Thus, if it could be gathered from the\n\naverments made in the plaint that averments with regard\n\nto readiness and willingness can be found, it would\n\nsuffice and on account of exact words not being found,\n\nthe plaintiff cannot be non-suited.\n\n Page 146 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n120. The Apex Court in the case of K.Kupuraj vs M.\n\nGaneshan - AIR 2021 SC 4652 has held :\n\n \"8. It is required to be noted that as per the case of\n the original plaintiff, the defendant was required to\n evict the tenants and hand over the physical and vacant\n possession at the time of execution of the sale deed on\n payment of full sale consideration. Even in the suit\n notice issued by the plaintiff, the plaintiff called upon\n the defendant to evict the tenants and thereafter\n execute the sale deed on payment of full consideration\n from the plaintiff. Even when we consider the pleadings\n and the averments in the plaint, it appears that the\n plaintiff was never willing to get the sale deed executed\n with tenants and/or as it is. It was the insistence on the\n part of the plaintiff to deliver the vacant possession\n after evicting the tenants. Therefore, on the basis of the\n pleadings in the plaint and on appreciation of evidence,\n the learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness\n against the plaintiff. However, before the High Court,\n the plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that he is now\n ready and willing to get the sale deed executed with\n respect to the property with tenants and unfortunately,\n the High Court relying upon the affidavit in the first\n appeal considered that as now the plaintiff is ready and\n willing to purchase the property with tenants and get\n the sale deed executed with respect to the property in\n question with tenants, the High Court has allowed the\n appeal and decreed the suit for specific performance.\n The aforesaid procedure adopted by the High Court\n relying upon the affidavit in a First Appeal by which\n virtually without submitting any application for\n amendment of the plaint under \nOrder VI Rule 17 CPC\n,\n the High Court as a First Appellate Court has taken on\n record the affidavit and as such relied upon the same.\n Such a procedure is untenable and unknown to law.\n First appeals are to be decided after following the\n procedure to be followed under \nthe CPC\n. The affidavit,\n which was filed by the plaintiff and which has been\n relied upon by the High Court is just contrary to the\n pleadings in the plaint. As observed hereinabove, there\n were no pleadings in the plaint that he is ready and\n willing to purchase the property and get the sale deed\n executed of the property with tenants and the specific\n\n Page 147 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n pleadings were to hand over the peaceful and vacant\n possession after getting the tenants evicted and to\n execute the sale deed. The proper procedure would\n have been for the plaintiff to move a proper application\n for amendment of the plaint in exercise of the power\n under \nOrder VI Rule 17 CPC\n, if at all it would have\n been permissible in a first appeal under Section 96\n read with \nOrder XLI CPC\n. However, straightaway to\n rely upon the affidavit without amending the plaint and\n the pleadings is wholly impermissible under the law.\n Therefore, such a procedure adopted by the High Court\n is disapproved.\n\n The learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness\n against the plaintiff by giving cogent reasons and\n appreciation of evidence and considering the pleadings\n and averments in the plaint. We have also gone through\n the averments and the pleadings in the plaint and on\n considering the same, we are of the opinion that the\n learned Trial Court was justified in holding the issue of\n willingness against the plaintiff. The plaintiff was never\n ready and willing to purchase the property and/or get\n the sale deed executed of the property with tenants. It\n was for the first time before the High Court in the\n affidavit filed before the High Court and subsequently\n when the learned Trial Court held the issue of\n willingness against the plaintiff, the plaintiff came out\n with a case that he is ready and willing to purchase the\n property with tenants. For the purpose of passing the\n decree for specific performance, the plaintiff has to\n prove both the readiness and willingness. Therefore,\n once it is found on appreciation of evidence that there\n was no willingness on the part of the plaintiff, the\n plaintiff is not entitled to the decree for specific\n performance. Therefore, in the present case, the\n learned Trial Court was justified in refusing to pass the\n decree for specific performance.\"\n\n121. A plea was raised in the aforesaid case by the\n\ndefendant that plaintiff has not pleaded readiness and\n\nwillingness, which was rebutted by the plaintiff. It was\n\nagreed under the agreement of sale therein that\n\n Page 148 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\ndefendant would evict the tenants and hand over physical\n\nand vacant possession of the suit schedule property at the\n\ntime of execution of the sale deed. This plea was\n\nconsidered by the Hon'ble Apex Court as plaintiff therein\n\nwas not willing to obtain the sale deed with tenants.\n\nWhen this principle enunciated by the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt is applied to the facts of this case and when we\n\nturn our attention to Exhibit 194 namely agreement of\n\nsale dated 27.12.1974, it would indicate that\n\nconsideration of Rs.25,000/- was paid by the plaintiff to\n\nthe 14th defendant (not to the 1st defendant trust) for\n\npurchasing the suit schedule property on the condition\n\nthat owner (1st defendant) will have to obtain permission\n\nof the Charity Commissioner for selling the suit schedule\n\nproperty and title clearance certificate has to be obtained\n\nfrom the competent authority within six months. It was\n\nalso stipulated by the plaintiff that necessary NA\n\npermission, ULC permission will have to be furnished by\n\nthe vendor viz., 14th defendant or 1st defendant. These\n\nconditions stipulated under Exhibit 194 would indicate\n\n Page 149 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nthat plaintiff was only willing to purchase the suit\n\nschedule property conditionally namely if there were to\n\nbe permission granted by the Charity Commissioner and\n\nother statutory permissions being available. In other\n\nwords, plaintiff was not willing to purchase the suit\n\nschedule property in the absence of these permissions. As\n\nsuch, the principles enunciated by the Apex Court in\n\nKaruppuraj's case referred to supra would be applicable.\n\n122. In this background, when we look at the\n\ndeposition of PW-1 it would emerge therefrom that there\n\nis not even a whisper by said witness expressing his\n\nreadiness and willingness. The principles enunciated by\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the matter of \nMan Kaur (dead)\n\nby LRS vs Hartar Singh Sanga\n - (2010) 10 SCC 512\n\nwould be apposite to be quoted, wherein it has been held\n\nthat if plaintiff has to prove readiness and willingness, he\n\nhas to step into the witness-box and has to give evidence\n\nthat he was all along ready and willing to perform. It has\n\nbeen further held :\n\n Page 150 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n \"17. \nSection 10\n of the Act deals with cases in which\n specific performance of contract is enforceable. It\n provides that except as otherwise provided in that\n Chapter (dealing with Specific Performance of\n Contracts) of the Act, specific performance of any\n contract may, in the discretion of the court, be\n enforced when the act agreed to be done is such that\n compensation in money for its non-performance would\n not afford adequate relief. Explanation (i) to \nsection 10\n\n provides that unless and until the contrary is proved,\n the court shall presume that the breach of a contract to\n transfer immovable property cannot be adequately\n relieved by compensation in money. Sub-sections (2)\n and (5) of \nsection 21\n of the Act provide that in a suit for\n specific performance, if the court decides that specific\n performance ought not to be granted, but that there is\n a contract between the parties which has been broken\n by the defendant, and that the plaintiff is entitled to\n compensation for that breach, it shall award him such\n compensation accordingly; and that no compensation\n shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintiff\n has claimed such compensation in his plaint. \nSection 23\n\n of the Act provides that a contract otherwise proper to\n be specifically enforced, may be so enforced, though a\n sum be named in it as the amount to be paid in case of\n its breach and the party in default is willing to pay the\n same, if the court, having regard to the terms of the\n contract and other attending circumstances, is satisfied\n that the sum was named only for the purpose of\n securing performance of the contract and not for the\n purpose of giving to the party in default an option of\n paying money in lieu of specific performance.\"\n\n123. Plaintiff must allege and aver that he was ready\n\nand willing to perform his part of contract from date of\n\nagreement till the date of institution of the suit as held by\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nSandhya Rani vs\n\nSudha Rani\n reported in AIR 1978 SC 537. In the instant\n\ncase, there is not even whisper in the plaint to the said\n\n Page 151 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\neffect or averments made in the plaint does not even\n\nremotely suggest about readiness and willingness of the\n\nplaintiff either prior to the suit or at the time of\n\ninstitution of the suit or thereafter. The evidence of PW-1\n\nis also silent. In totality, there is no averment found\n\nanywhere from the pleadings, for this Court to arrive at a\n\nconclusion that plaintiff has been ready and willing to\n\nperform its part of the contract and defendants had failed\n\nto perform their part of the contract. In the absence of\n\npleadings and evidence, refusal to grant discretionary\n\nrelief by the trial court cannot be found fault with and\n\nsaid findings have t be necessarily held as just and proper\n\nand same would not call for our interference in appellate\n\njurisdiction. If two views are possible and the one taken\n\nby the trial Court being in consonance with material\n\nevidence available on record, this Court would not disturb\n\nsuch finding in exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n124. It would be further necessary to note yet\n\nanother plea has been raised by Mr.Yatin Oza, learned\n\nSenior Counsel appearing for the plaintiff contending that\n\n Page 152 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nwhen there is no issue in this regard framed by trial\n\nCourt, there was no need or necessity for plaintiff to\n\nprove the said issue. Though said argument would look\n\nattractive at first blush, it cannot be accepted for reasons\n\nmore than one. Firstly, consent cannot confer\n\njurisdiction. Secondly, \nSection 16(c)\n being mandatory,\n\nabsence of plea in the plaint and in the deposition it\n\nwould not otherwise cure the glaring defect. Thirdly,\n\nplaintiff has not sought for recasting of the issues but on\n\nthe other hand with open eyes, having known the defense\n\nput up by the defendants Nos.1 to 4 and 6 in their written\n\nstatement at paragraph-14 has proceeded with the suit\n\nand submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the Court and\n\ncalled for an opinion or judgment in that regard.\n\nFourthly, the judgment of the trial court would indicate\n\nat paragraph-11 while adjudicating issue No.9 and 10\n\nlearned Trial Judge has examined this issue and held that\n\nterms of the agreement would indicate that plaintiff had\n\nexpressed or given its conditional willingness, which has\n\nalready been noticed by us hereinsupra as impermissible\n\n Page 153 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\nin the teeth of judgment of the Apex Court in Karuppura's\n\ncase supra. Thus, contentions raised in this regard stands\n\nrejected.\n\n125. While the court exercises the discretionary\n\npower for grant or refusal of a decree of specific\n\nperformance, one of the paramount considerations would\n\nbe the conduct of the plaintiff which would be taken into\n\nconsideration. If the conduct of the plaintiff is such that\n\nwhich would not inspire confidence, then necessarily the\n\ndiscretionary power would not be exercised to grant the\n\nrelief, but, on the other hand, if the plaintiff has come the\n\ncourt with clean hands and has played his role with\n\nutmost sincerity, necessarily the discretionary relief\n\nwould be granted. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nAtma Ram v. Charanjit Singh\n [AIR 2020 SC 3413]\n\nhas held as under:\n\n \"... ... ... A person issues legal notice on particular year\n claiming readiness and willingness and files a suit for\n mandatory injunction and after three years converts the\n said suit to specific performance suit will not be entitled\n to the relief of specific performance.\"\n\n Page 154 of 157\n\n Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:49:48 IST 2023\n\n C/FA/3517/2000 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 12/01/2023\n\n126. Yet another important aspect which the court\n\nwould take into consideration while considering the plea\n\nfor grant of specific performance would be readiness and\n\nwillingness where the balance sheet of the plaintiff does\n\nnot reflect of having sufficient fund to discharge the\n\nplaintiff's part of the contract, the discretionary relief\n\nwould not be granted as held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in\n\nthe case of U.N. Krishnamurthy (since deceased) Thr.\n\nLrs. Versus A.M. Krishnamurthy [AIR 2022 SC 3361].\n\nIn the instant case, the plaintiff's balance sheet as per\n\nExhibit 208 reflects it does not possess any fund and there\n\nis negative profit and as such question of granting specific\n\nperformance would not arise. Hence, point Nos. (vi) and\n\n(vii) is answered by holding that judgment and decree\n\npassed in Special Civil Suit No. 167 of 1984 deserves to be\n\nconfirmed and there is no error committed by the Trial\n\nCourt in dismissing the suit.\n\n127.

In the\n adoption deed itself, the ceremony which had taken\n place on 14.11.2001 was mentioned, hence it was\n within the knowledge of the appellants- plaintiffs even\n on the date of filing of the suit. In the absence of any\n pleading in the suit filed by the appellants, at belated\n stage, after evidence is closed, the appellants have filed\n the application to summon the record relating to leave/\n service of Ramesh Chander Singh on 14.11.2001 from\n the Rajput Regiment Centre Fatehgarh. It is fairly well\n settled that in absence of pleading, any amount of\n evidence will not help the party. When the adoption\n ceremony, which had taken place on 14.11.2001, is\n mentioned in the registered adoption deed, which was\n questioned in the suit, there is absolutely no reason for\n not raising specific plea in the suit and to file\n application at belated stage to summon the record to\n prove that the second respondent- Ramesh Chander\n Singh was on duty C.A.Nos.4883-4884 of 2017 as on\n 14.11.2001. There was an order from the High Court\n for expeditious disposal of the suit and the application\n which was filed belatedly is rightly dismissed by the\n Trial Court and confirmed by the Revisional Court and\n High Court.\""

It is required to be noted that as per the case of\n the original plaintiff, the defendant was required to\n evict the tenants and hand over the physical and vacant\n possession at the time of execution of the sale deed on\n payment of full sale consideration. Even in the suit\n notice issued by the plaintiff, the plaintiff called upon\n the defendant to evict the tenants and thereafter\n execute the sale deed on payment of full consideration\n from the plaintiff. Even when we consider the pleadings\n and the averments in the plaint, it appears that the\n plaintiff was never willing to get the sale deed executed\n with tenants and/or as it is. It was the insistence on the\n part of the plaintiff to deliver the vacant possession\n after evicting the tenants. Therefore, on the basis of the\n pleadings in the plaint and on appreciation of evidence,\n the learned Trial Court held the issue of willingness\n against the plaintiff. However, before the High Court,\n the plaintiff filed an affidavit stating that he is now\n ready and willing to get the sale deed executed with\n respect to the property with tenants and unfortunately,\n the High Court relying upon the affidavit in the first\n appeal considered that as now the plaintiff is ready and\n willing to purchase the property with tenants and get\n the sale deed executed with respect to the property in\n question with tenants, the High Court has allowed the\n appeal and decreed the suit for specific performance.\n The aforesaid procedure adopted by the High Court\n relying upon the affidavit in a First Appeal by which\n virtually without submitting any application for\n amendment of the plaint under \nOrder VI Rule 17 CPC\n,\n the High Court as a First Appellate Court has taken on\n record the affidavit and as such relied upon the same.\n Such a procedure is untenable and unknown to law.\n First appeals are to be decided after following the\n procedure to be followed under \nthe CPC\n. The affidavit,\n which was filed by the plaintiff and which has been\n relied upon by the High Court is just contrary to the\n pleadings in the plaint.

It\n was for the first time before the High Court in the\n affidavit filed before the High Court and subsequently\n when the learned Trial Court held the issue of\n willingness against the plaintiff, the plaintiff came out\n with a case that he is ready and willing to purchase the\n property with tenants.
