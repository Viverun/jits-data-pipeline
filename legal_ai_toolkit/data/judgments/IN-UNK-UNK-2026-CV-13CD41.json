First Appeal\n No.201018/2018 by which the High Court has\n dismissed the said appeal and has confirmed\n the order dated 02.04.2018 passed by the\n learned III Additional District & Sessions\n Judge, Vijayapur (hereinafter referred to as\n “trial Court”) in rejecting the application for\n condonation of delay caused in preferring the\n application under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred\n to as “\nArbitration Act\n”) , the original applicant\n has preferred the present appeal.\n\n2. The brief facts leading to filing of the present\n appeal in nut­shell are as under:\n\n2.1 That, an arbitral award was passed against the\n appellant under the provisions of the\n \nArbitration Act\n on 24.08.2016. As per Section\n 34(3) of the Arbitration Act, 90 days are\n prescribed for preferring an application under\n \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act against the\n arbitral award. However, the said period was\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 2 of 44\n\n\f extendable by a further period of 30 days in\n terms of the proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n of the Act,\n 2016. In the present case, the period of 90\n days prescribed under \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act expired on 24.11.2016. The\n appellant was entitled to a further extended\n period of 30 days from 23.11.2016 onwards in\n terms of the proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n which was\n upto 24.12.2016.\n\n2.2 The trial Courts were closed on account of\n winter / Christmas vacations from 19.12.2016\n to 01.01.2017. However, it so happened that\n extendable / condonable period of 30 days as\n contemplated in the proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n\n expired on 24.12.2016 on which day the trial\n Court was closed on account of winter /\n Christmas vacation. The appellant herein filed\n the application under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act, challenging the award passed\n by the Arbitral Tribunal. The appellant also\n filed IA No.1 for condonation of delay. Both,\n \nSection 34\n application as well as the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 3 of 44\n\n\f application for condonation of delay were filed\n on the reopening day i.e. on 02.01.2017. As\n the application under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act was beyond the prescribed\n period of provided under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act as well as beyond the\n condonable period of 30 days, the learned trial\n Court dismissed the IA No.1 and refused to\n condone the delay by observing that the period\n beyond 120 days is not condonable as under\n\n the \nArbitration Act\n, maximum period provided\n for preferring an application under \nSection 34\n\n is 120 days. At this stage it is required to be\n noted that in the affidavit filed by the appellant\n before the High Court, filed in support of IA\n No.1, the appellant as such admitted that it\n received the copy of the award on 24.08.2016.\n However, according to the appellant, the said\n award was misplaced and thereafter obtained a\n fresh copy on 29.12.2016. The learned trial\n Court observed that in that view of the matter,\n the period of limitation would commence from\n 24.08.2016 and 120 days are to be counted\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 4 of 44\n\n\f from 24.08.2016.\n\n2.3 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\n order passed by the learned trial Court\n refusing to condone the delay in preferring\n application under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n Act, the appellant herein preferred an appeal\n before the High Court.\n\n2.4 Before the High Court, \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation Act, 1963 and \nSection 10\n of the\n General Clauses Act, 1897 were pressed into\n service. By the impugned judgment and order\n the High Court has dismissed the said appeal\n by observing that the expression “prescribed\n period” appearing in \nSection 4\n of the Limitation\n Act cannot be construed to mean anything\n other than the period of limitation and\n therefore, any period beyond the prescribed\n period, during which the Court or Tribunal has\n the discretion to allow a person to institute the\n proceeding, cannot be taken to be “prescribed\n period”.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 5 of 44\n\n\f2.5 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the\n impugned judgment and order passed by the\n High Court, the original applicant has\n preferred the present appeal.\n\n3. Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Senior Advocate\n has appeared on behalf of the appellant and\n Shri Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Advocate\n has appeared on behalf of the contesting\n respondent.\n\n4. Shri Shyam Diwan, learned Counsel has\n submitted that \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration\n Act specifies that the limitation period for filing\n an application for setting aside the arbitral\n award under \nSection 34\n is three months from\n the date on which the party making application\n has received the award. However, if the Court\n is satisfied that the applicant was prevented by\n sufficient cause from making the application\n within the said period of three months, the\n proviso to the Section specifies a further period\n of 30 days within which the application under\n \nSection 34\n may be filed/entertained.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 6 of 44\n\n\f4.1 It is submitted that the central question in the\n present petition is whether when the last day\n of condonable period of 30 days falls on a\n holiday or during a court vacation, would the\n benefit of \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses\n Act, 1897 would be available to the appellant?\n\n4.2 It is submitted that in other words, can the\n petitioner – appellant file the application on the\n next date when the Court reopens, in line with\n the settled principle that the law does not\n compel a person to do an impossible act. It is\n submitted that in the present case the\n petitioner – appellant had filed the application\n under \nSection 34\n on the very day when the\n Court reopened.\n\n4.3 It is submitted by Shri Shyam Diwan, learned\n Senior Counsel that not extending the benefit\n of \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act to the\n appellant in such circumstances leads to an\n anomalous situation wherein the benefit of\n statutorily prescribed condonable period is cut\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 7 of 44\n\n\f short for some persons due to intervention of a\n holiday or a court vacation, while being fully\n available to other persons due to the fortuitous\n circumstance of no court vacation intervening.\n\n It is submitted that this creates uncertainty\n and unpredictability in the application of\n provision in question.\n\n4.4 It is submitted that the present case reflects an\n anomalous situation where \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation Act, which only deals with the\n period of limitation prescribed under the\n \nLimitation Act\n, leaves a vacuum as far as\n statutory condonable period is concerned. It is\n submitted that the judgment in the case of\n \nAssam Urban Water Supply and Sewerage\n Board vs. Subash Projects and Marketing\n Limited\n reported in (2012) 2 SCC 624 failed\n to take into account that in the case of such\n statutory condonable periods, \nSection 10\n of the\n General Clauses Act, 1897, which is much\n wider in its import and applicability, and\n embodies the same legal principle, must\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 8 of 44\n\n\f necessarily step in to fill the vacuum.\n\n4.5 It is submitted that while passing the\n impugned judgment and order, the High Court\n has heavily relied upon the decision of this\n Court in the case of \nAssam Urban\n (Supra)\n while holding that the term “prescribed period”\n referred to in \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act,\n 1963 only includes the limitation period and\n not the 30­day condonable / grace period.\n \nIt is\n submitted that however the case of \nAssam\n Urban\n (Supra) does not notice or deal with\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897. It\n only notices and deals with \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation Act, 1963 and holds that the term\n “prescribed period” mentioned in \nSection 4\n\n means the period of limitation.\n \nIt is submitted\n that the judgment in the case of \nAssam Urban\n\n (Supra) fails to notice that \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation Act, 1963 which deals with the\n period of limitation prescribed under the\n \nLimitation Act, 1963\n, leaves a vacuum as far\n as the statutory condonable period is\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 9 of 44\n\n\f concerned.\n\n4.6 It is submitted that in failing to notice \nSection\n 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897, the\n judgment in the case of \nAssam Urban\n (Supra)\n disregards the principle embodied in the\n \nGeneral Clauses Act\n which is much wider in its\n import and applicability and must necessarily\n step in to fill the vacuum left by \nSection 4\n of\n the Limitation Act.\n\n4.7 It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned\n Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant\n that although the same general principle of\n “elementary justice” is embodied in both\n Sections of the two Acts, there is a crucial\n distinction between the \nLimitation Act, 1963\n\n and the \nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n.\n\n4.8 It is submitted that \nSection 2(j)\n of the\n Limitation Act defines “period of limitation”. It\n is submitted that thus, while the term\n “prescribed period” has a narrower meaning in\n the context of \nLimitation Act\n, there is no such\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 10 of 44\n\n\f restrictive definition clause in the \nGeneral\n Clauses Act\n. It is submitted that in fact, the\n scheme of \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses\n Act is clear from a bare perusal of the provision\n and indicates that there are two prescribed\n periods in this Section viz. (1) the prescribed\n period within which something is directed to be\n done, or (2) the prescribed period within which\n something is allowed to be done.\n\n4.9 It is submitted that therefore, reading of\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897\n makes it clear that the period in which\n something is allowed to be done, such as 30\n days condonable period provided by proviso to\n \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act is also a\n prescribed period within the meaning of the\n \nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n.\n\n4.10 It is further submitted by Shri Shyam Diwan,\n learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n the appellant that the principle embodied in\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is\n an elementary piece of justice. It is submitted\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 11 of 44\n\n\f that the 60th Law Commission Report on the\n General Clauses Act reiterated the\n parliamentary intention behind the Act and the\n provision, which is to deliver elementary\n justice.\n\n4.11 It is submitted that in the case of \nHUDA &\n Anr. vs. Dr. Babeswar Kanhar & Anr.\n\n reported in (2005) 1 SCC 191, this Court has\n observed and held that every consideration of\n justice and expediency would require that the\n accepted principle which underlines \nSection 10\n\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897 should be\n applied in cases where it does not otherwise in\n terms apply. It is observed that the principles\n underlying are lex non cogit ad impossibilia (law\n does not compel a man to do the impossible)\n and actus curiae neminem gravabit (the act of\n court shall prejudice no man).\n \nIt is submitted\n that in the case of \nManohar Joshi vs. Nitin\n Bhaurao Patil and Ors.\n reported in (1996) 1\n SCC 169, it is observed and held by this Court\n that the litigant has a right to avail limitation\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 12 of 44\n\n\f up to the last day and his only obligation is to\n explain his inability to present the suit /\n petition on the last day of limitation and each\n day thereafter till it is actually presented.\n\n4.12 It is further submitted that if as held in the\n case of \nAssam Urban\n (Supra), the benefit of\n \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act is only available\n for the period of limitation and is not available\n for the statutorily granted condonable period.\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897\n must step in to fill the vacuum. It is submitted\n that any contrary view would deny individuals\n the full play of the statutory period of 30 days\n for condonation of delay.\n\n4.13 Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the\n respondent that present proceeding is “any Act\n or proceeding to which the \nLimitation Act\n\n applies” is a misconceived argument is\n concerned, it is submitted that the\n respondents have sought to rely on proviso to\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897.\n Relying upon Section 43(1) of the Arbitration\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 13 of 44\n\n\f Act to contend that the \nLimitation Act\n applies\n to the present proceedings, it is submitted that\n \nSection 43(1)\n of the Arbitration Act merely\n states that “the \nLimitation Act, 1963\n shall\n apply to arbitrations as it applies to\n proceedings in Court”. It is submitted that this\n cannot be interpreted to mean that the\n \nLimitation Act\n, in its entirety applies to\n proceeding under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n Act and that the present proceedings are an\n act or proceeding to which the \nLimitation Act\n\n applies. It is submitted that in fact, in matters\n of limitation, \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act\n is a complete code. It is submitted that the\n respondent’s entire case, on one hand, is that\n the benefit of \nLimitation Act\n, particularly\n \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act, cannot be given\n to the condonable period in the instant case. It\n is submitted that therefore on one hand, the\n respondent is arguing that the benefit of\n \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act, as well as\n \nSection 5\n of the Limitation Act has no\n application to the condonable period under\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 14 of 44\n\nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act, i.e. the\n \nLimitation Act\n has no application in the\n present proceedings, at the same time, the\n respondent is contending that the benefit of\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897\n cannot be given to the appellant, as the\n present proceeding falls within the ambit of the\n phrase “any act or proceeding to which the\n Indian Limitation Act, 1877, applies”.\n\n4.14 It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned\n Senior Counsel that the reliance placed on the\n case of \nSagufa Ahmed & Ors. vs. Upper\n Assam Polywood Products Private Limited\n and Others\n reported in (2021) 2 SCC 317 is\n misconceived for the following two reasons:\n\n \n(1) The reference to \nSection 10\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897 in the case of \nSagufa\n Ahmed\n (Supra) is tangential at best;\n (2) The facts of \nSagufa Ahmed\n (Supra) are\n clearly distinguishable from the case at\n hand. In that case, the appellants had\n waited 5 months after the discretionary\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 15 of 44\n\n\f period had expired to file an appeal against\n the order of the Ld. NCLT. In the present\n case, there was no undue delay on the part\n of the Petitioner ­ appellant herein. The\n petitioner ­ appellant filed the petition under\n Section 34 of the very day of the reopening\n of the Ld. Court.\n\n4.15 It is submitted that this Court in its order\n dated 08.03.2021 in suo moto Writ Petition\n (Civil) No.3/2020, has put a quietus to the\n artificial distinction between the ‘limitation\n period’ and ‘grace period’, wherein it extended\n the benefit of exemption due to COVID 19 to\n the limitation period as well as the condonable\n period.\n\n4.16 It is further submitted by Shri Diwan, learned\n Senior Counsel that the aim and object of the\n limitation period and statutory grace period /\n condonable period provided in the \nArbitration\n Act\n is to ensure that parties who sleep over\n their rights and come to the court belatedly are\n not allowed to upset the apple cart. It is\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 16 of 44\n\n\f submitted that in the present instance, the\n appellant has been nothing but diligent and\n approached the learned trial Court on the very\n day of reopening. It is submitted that \nSection\n 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897 has been\n enacted to address precisely this kind of a\n situation and merely because the benefit of\n \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act, 1963 is\n unavailable in a case, should not ipso facto\n exclude the application of the \nGeneral Clauses\n Act, 1897\n.\n\n4.17 It is submitted that the appellant is an\n agriculturists’ society, and despite having\n suffered losses due to non­fulfillment of their\n obligations by the respondent, the appellant’s\n case has never been heard on merits. It is\n submitted that therefore non­suiting the\n appellant in the present instance and denying\n the benefit of \nSection 10\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897 (with the elementary rule of\n justice captured in it) will cause a grave\n miscarriage of justice.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 17 of 44\n\n\f Making above submissions, it is prayed to\n set aside the order passed by the learned trial\n Court as well as the High Court and to\n condone the delay caused in preferring\n application under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n Act and to direct the learned trial Court to hear\n the application under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act on merits by giving the\n appellant an opportunity to put forth its case\n on merits.\n\n5. Present appeal is vehemently opposed by Shri\n Dhruv Mehta, learned Senior Counsel\n appearing on behalf of the respondent.\n\n5.1 It is submitted that in the present case the\n appellant admittedly received the award on\n 24.08.2016. As per \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act, “the prescribed period” of 3\n months to challenge the award expired on\n 24.11.2016 and further period of 30 days\n under the proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act expired on 24.12.2016. That,\n the learned trial Court was on winter vacation\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 18 of 44\n\n\f between 19.12.2016 to 01.01.2017. The\n appellant preferred its \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration Act before the learned trial Court\n on 02.01.2017 i.e. on the day of reopening,\n accompanied by an application seeking\n condonation of delay. It is submitted that the\n learned trial Court after considering both, the\n maintainability and merits of the appellant’s\n application for condonation, has found that the\n application was not maintainable and also that\n no sufficient cause had been shown by the\n appellant. It is submitted that the High Court\n has upheld the order of trial Court that the\n petition under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act\n was not maintainable for being beyond the\n “prescribed period” under \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act. It is submitted that therefore\n the following questions arise for consideration\n in the present case.\n\n (1)Whether the benefit of \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation Act, 1963 is available to a party\n when the “prescribed period” of 3 months for\n filing a petition under Section 34(3) of the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 19 of 44\n\nArbitration Act\n has already expired and the\n discretionary period of 30 days under the\n proviso to Section 34(3) falls on a day when\n the Court is closed?\n\n (2)Whether the benefit of \nSection 10\n of the\n General Clauses Act,1897 is separately\n available to a party in such circumstances?\n\n5.2 Now, so far as the applicability of \nSection 4\n of\n the Limitation Act is concerned, it is\n vehemently submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta,\n learned Senior Counsel that \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation Act shall not be applicable to the 30\n days’ discretionary condonable period\n contemplated under proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n of\n the Arbitration Act. It is submitted that \nSection\n 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act stipulates that an\n application under \nSection 34(1)\n of the\n Arbitration Act challenging an arbitral award\n may not be made after a period of three\n months from the date on which the party\n making the application had received the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 20 of 44\n\n\f arbitral award. The proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n\n gives limited powers to the Court, on sufficient\n cause being shown, to condone delay in filing\n the application under \nSection 34(1)\n only for a\n maximum period of 30 days, but not\n thereafter. It is submitted that in the case of\n \nUnion of India v. Popular Construction Co.\n\n reported in (2001) 8 SCC 470 (Paras 10, 12,\n 14 and 16), this Court has observed that\n usage of words “but not thereafter” in the\n proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n amounts to an express\n exclusion within the meaning of \nSection 29(2)\n\n of the Limitation Act. Therefore, the Court\n would have no discretion to condone the delay\n in excess of 30 days. \nSection 5\n of the\n Limitation Act was, therefore, held to be\n inapplicable to \nSection 34(1)\n of the Arbitration\n Act.\n\n5.3 It is submitted that \nSection 4\n of the Limitation\n Act is only applicable when the last date of the\n “prescribed period” falls on a day on which the\n Court is closed. It is submitted that the term,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 21 of 44\n\n\f “prescribed period” is defined in \nSection 2(j)\n of\n the Limitation Act as being the period of\n limitation computed in accordance with the\n provisions of the \nLimitation Act\n.\n\n5.4 It is submitted that this Court in the case of\n \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) (Paras 10 to 14) has\n held that “prescribed period” under \nSection\n 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act is three months. It\n is submitted that “further period” of 30 days\n mentioned in the proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act cannot be said to be the “period\n of limitation” and therefore, would not be the\n “prescribed period” for the purposes of making\n an application for setting aside the arbitral\n award. It is submitted that thus, in \nthe said\n decision\n, this Court has categorically held that\n \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act which applies\n only to “prescribed period” is not attracted\n when the last date of the “further period” of 30\n days mentioned in \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Limitation Act falls on a day on which the\n Court is closed.\n \nIt is submitted that the facts of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 22 of 44\n\n\f the case in \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) are identical\n to the facts of the present case.\n \nIt is submitted\n that decision of this Court in the case of\n \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) has been affirmed by\n Three Judges’ Bench of this Court in the case\n of \nSagufa Ahmed\n (Supra) (Paras 20 – 22).\n\n5.5 It is further submitted by Shri Dhruv Mehta,\n learned Senior Counsel that the correct\n application of \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act\n will result in a petition being entertained as a\n matter of right, without a party having to seek\n condonation of delay, since it applies only to\n petitions that would otherwise be within the\n “prescribed period” but its presentation within\n this period has been prevented due to closure\n of the Court. However, on the other hand, this\n cannot apply to a delayed petition where, in\n any event, the right to present the petition is\n subject sufficient cause being shown and\n condonation of delay being sought.\n\n5.6 Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\n appellant that the judgment in the case of\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 23 of 44\n\nSagufa Ahmed\n (Supra) is not a good law or is\n distinguishable is concerned, it is submitted\n that as such the decision in the case of \nSagufa\n Ahmed\n (Supra) lays down the correct law and\n shall be applicable with full force on\n interpretation of “to condone delay within\n further period”.\n\n5.7 It is submitted that the judgment in the case of\n \nSagufa Ahmed\n (Supra), in the context of\n \nSection 421(3)\n of the Companies Act, 2013,\n which provides a prescribed period of 45 days\n for filing an appeal, and empowers the\n appellate Tribunal to condone the delay within\n “further period” not exceeding 45 days. A\n Three­Judges Bench of this Court rejected the\n contention of the appellants therein that the\n benefit of order of this Court dated 23.03.2020\n in Cognizance for Extension of Limitation, In\n re, (2020) 19 SCC 10, is extendable to them, by\n holding that under the order dated\n 23.03.2020, which was extended was only “the\n period of limitation” and not the period up to\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 24 of 44\n\n\f which delay can be condoned in exercise of\n discretion conferred by statute.\n\n5.8 It is submitted that thus, in the case of \nSagufa\n Ahmed\n (Supra), this Court while affirming\n \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) has held that the\n expression “prescribed period” appearing in\n \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act cannot be\n construed to mean anything other than the\n period of limitation. Any period beyond the\n “prescribed period” during which the Court or\n Tribunal has the discretion to allow a person to\n institute the proceedings cannot be taken to be\n “prescribed period”.\n\n5.9 Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\n appellant that the judgment in the case of\n \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) has the effect of denying\n the parties to right to file their application for\n condonation in situation where the\n discretionary period expires during vacation\n and that such interpretation was incorrect\n inasmuch as it leaves parties at the mercy of\n “fortuitous circumstance”, it is submitted that\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 25 of 44\n\n\f such a submission is not tenable. It is\n submitted that the Court vacations are notified\n well in advance and would not account to a\n fortuitous circumstance as alleged. It is\n submitted that on the date of receipt of award,\n the party would be well aware of the limitation\n period under \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration\n Act and ought to diligently secure its right. It is\n submitted that in the present case, having\n received the award on 24.08.2016, the\n appellant had a further period of 25 days after\n expiry of “prescribed period” and before\n commencement of the winter vacation of the\n trial Court. However, the petitioner ­ appellant\n chose not to file its petition during this time\n and therefore, as to suffer for the inevitable\n consequences.\n\n5.10 It is further submitted that right under \nSection\n 34\n of the Arbitration Act is a restricted right to\n challenge an award on extremely limited\n ground. The proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act further excludes the general\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 26 of 44\n\n\f power of the Court under \nSection 5\n of the\n Limitation Act and imposes a strict timeline for\n presentation of a petition under Section 34. In\n such circumstances, acceptance of appellant’s\n argument will have the effect of providing an\n unduly enlarged time period (beyond the\n statutory 30 day discretionary period) for\n delayed presentation of a petition under\n Section 34, which would be contrary to the\n scheme and intent of the \nArbitration Act\n.\n\n5.11 Now, so far as the applicability of \nSection 10\n of\n the General Clauses Act, 1897 as per the case\n of the appellant is concerned, it is vehemently\n submitted that as such the contention is\n untenable in light of the proviso to \nSection 10\n\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897, which\n specifically excludes the application of this\n section to any Act or proceeding to which the\n \nIndian Limitation Act\n applies. It is submitted\n that reference to 1877 Act will now have to be\n read as reference to \nLimitation Act, 1963\n in\n view of \nsection 8\n of the General Clauses Act,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 27 of 44\n\n\f 1897. It is submitted that it is no longer res\n integra that the \nLimitation Act, 1963\n applies to\n arbitrations and court proceedings arising out\n of the arbitrations in light of \nSection 41(3)\n of\n the Arbitration Act. Reliance is placed upon the\n decision of this Court in the case of \nState of\n Maharashtra v. Borse Brothers Engineers\n and Contractors Pvt. Ltd.\n reported in (\n2021)\n 6 SCC 460 and Consolidated Engineering\n Enterprises vs. Principal Secretary,\n Irrigation Department and Ors.\n reported in\n (2008) 7 SCC 169. It is submitted that\n therefore in light of the application of the\n \nLimitation Act, 1963\n applicable to the\n proceedings under the \nArbitration Act\n (both in\n Court and in arbitration), \nSection 10\n of the\n General Clauses Act, 1897 is specifically\n excluded, and therefore, cannot be relied upon\n by the appellant.\n\n5.12 It is submitted that even otherwise this Court\n in the \nSagufa Ahmed\n (Supra) has held that\n the principle forming the basis of \nSection 10(1)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 28 of 44\n\n\f of the \nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n also finds a\n place in \nSection 4\n of the Limitation Act.\n Therefore, when the benefit of \nSection 4\n of the\n Arbitration Act is not available, the appellant\n cannot seek to take recourse to \nSection 10\n of\n the General Clauses Act, 1897 which embodies\n the same principle.\n\n5.13 It is further submitted that just like \nSection 4\n\n of the Limitation Act, \nSection 10\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897 also uses the term\n “prescribed period”. \nSection 10\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897 provides that where any act\n is directed to be done on a certain day, or any\n proceeding is allowed to be done in any Court\n or office within prescribed period, if the Court\n or office is closed on that certain day, or the\n last day of the prescribed period, it may be\n done or taken on the next working day.\n Accordingly, if \nSection 10\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897 was to be applicable, the\n term “prescribed period” must be given the\n same meaning as that in the \nLimitation Act\n.\n Thus, \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 29 of 44\n\n\f 1897 will also only then apply for the\n prescribed period of three months under\n \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act and not to\n the discretionary period of 30 days under the\n proviso to \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n \nMaking above submissions and relying\n upon the decision of this Court in the case of\n \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) and \nSagufa Ahmed\n\n (Supra), it is prayed to dismiss the present\n appeal.\n\n6. Having heard learned Counsel appearing for\n the respective parties, a short question which\n is posed for consideration of this Court is\n whether in the facts and circumstances of the\n case, the learned trial Court was justified in\n not condoning the delay in preferring the\n application under \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act, which was filed after the expiry\n of 120 days but filed on the first day of\n reopening after the winter / Christmas\n vacation and in a case where the condonable\n period of 30 days under Section 34(3) of the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 30 of 44\n\nArbitration Act\n had fallen during the winter /\n Christmas vacation ? The question is with\n respect to applicability of \nSection 4\n of the\n Limitation and \nSection 10\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897 in the facts and\n circumstances of the case.\n\n Therefore, the central question in the\n present appeal is whether when the last day of\n condonable period of 30 days (under \nSection\n 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act) falls on holiday or\n during the Court vacation, would the benefit of\n \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897 be\n available?\n\n7. While considering the aforesaid issues/\n questions, \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act is\n required to be referred to, which reads as\n under:\n\n “34. Application for setting aside\n arbitral award.­ (3) An application for\n setting aside may not be made after\n three months have elapsed from the\n date on which the party making that\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 31 of 44\n\n\f application had received the arbitral\n award or, if a request had been made\n under section 33, from the date on\n which that request had been disposed\n of by the arbitral Tribunal:\n\n Provided that if the Court is\n satisfied that the applicant was\n prevented by sufficient cause from\n making the application within the said\n period of three months it may entertain\n the application within a further period\n of thirty days, but not thereafter.”\n\n The relevant provisions of the \nIndian\n Limitation Act and the General Clauses Act,\n 1897\n are also required to be referred to which\n are as under:\n\n “2.(j) ‘period of limitation’ (which)\n means the period of limitation\n prescribed for any suit, appeal or\n application by the Schedule, and\n ‘prescribed period’ means the period of\n limitation computed in accordance with\n the provisions of this Act;”\n\n “4. Expiry of prescribed period\n when court is closed.­ Where the\n prescribed period for any suit, appeal\n or application expires on a day when\n the court is closed, the suit, appeal or\n application may be instituted,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 32 of 44\n\n\f preferred or made on the day when the\n court reopens.\n\n Explanation.­ A court shall be\n deemed to be closed on any day within\n the meaning of this section if during\n any part of its normal working hours it\n remains closed on that day.”\n\n “\nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act,\n\n 1897\n\n 10. Computation of time.­ (1) Where,\n by any 47 (Central Act) or Regulation\n made after the commencement of this\n Act, any act or proceeding is directed\n or allowed to be done or taken in any\n Court or office on a certain day or\n within a prescribed period, then, if the\n Court or office is closed on that day or\n the last day of the prescribed period,\n the act or proceeding shall be\n considered as done or taken in due\n time if it is done or taken on the next\n day afterwards on which the Court or\n office is open:\n\n Provided that nothing in this\n section shall apply to any act or\n proceeding to which the Indian\n Limitation Act, 1877, 48 applies.\n\n \n(2) This section applies also to\n all 49 (Central Acts) and Regulations\n made on or after the fourteenth day of\n January, 1887.”\n (emphasis supplied)”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 33 of 44\n\n\f7.1 \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration Act and\n \nSections 2(j)\n and \n4\n of the Limitation Act, 1963\n fell for consideration before this Court in the\n case of \nAssam Urban\n (Supra).\n \nEven the very\n issue raised in the present appeal fell for\n consideration before this Court in the case of\n \nAssam Urban\n (Supra). In the aforesaid\n decision, this Court interpreted the aforesaid\n provisions and has specifically observed and\n held that the benefit of exclusion of period\n during which Court is closed is available only\n when application for setting aside the award is\n filed within ‘prescribed period of limitation’ and\n it is not available in respect of period\n extendable by the Court in exercise of its\n discretion.\n \nBy holding so, this Court\n considered the earlier decisions in the case of\n \nPopular Construction Co.\n (Supra) and \nState\n of Maharashtra vs. Hindustan Construction\n Co. Ltd.\n reported in (2010) 4 SCC 518 and\n has observed and held in paragraphs 6 to 9 as\n under:\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 34 of 44\n\n\f “6. Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act provides\n that an application for setting aside an award\n may be made within three months of the\n receipt of the arbitral award. The proviso that\n follows sub­section (3) of Section 34 provides\n that on sufficient cause being shown, the\n court may entertain the application for\n setting aside the award after the period of\n three months and within a further period of\n 30 days but not thereafter.\n\n 7. In Popular Construction Co.1, this Court has\n held that an application for setting aside an\n award filed beyond the period mentioned in\n Section 34(3) would not be an application \"in\n accordance with sub­section (3) as required\n under Section 34(1) of the 1996 Act\" and\n \nSection 5\n of the 1963 Act has no application\n to such application. In para 12 of the Report,\n it was held in Popular Construction Co.1\n thus: (SCC pp.474­75)\n \"12. As far as the language of Section 34\n of the 1996 Act is concerned, the crucial\n words are \"but not thereafter\" used in\n the proviso to sub­section (3). In our\n opinion, this phrase would amount to an\n express exclusion within the meaning of\n \nSection 29(2)\n of the Limitation Act, and\n would therefore bar the application of\n \nSection 5\n of that Act. Parliament did not\n need to go further. To hold that the court\n could entertain an application to set\n aside the award beyond the extended\n period under the proviso, would render\n the phrase \"but not thereafter\" wholly\n otiose. No principle of interpretation\n would justify such a result\".\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 35 of 44\n\n\f 8. Recently, in State of Maharashtra v.\n\n Hindustan Construction Company Limited2, a\n two­Judge Bench of this Court speaking\n through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.)\n emphasised the mandatory nature of the limit\n to the extension of the period provided in\n proviso to Section 34(3) and held that an\n application for setting aside arbitral award\n under Section 34 of the 1996 Act has to be\n made within the time prescribed under sub­\n section (3) of Section 34 i.e., within three\n months and a further period of 30 days on\n sufficient cause being shown and not\n thereafter.\n\n 9. Section 43(1) of the 1996 Act provides that\n the 1963 Act shall apply to arbitrations as it\n applies to proceedings in court. The 1963 Act\n is thus applicable to the matters of\n arbitration covered by the 1996 Act save and\n except to the extent its applicability has been\n excluded by virtue of the express provision\n contained in Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act.”\n\n Before this Court there existed, similar facts\n like in the present case. In the case before this\n Court, the arbitral awards were received by the\n appellants on 26.08.2003. No application for\n setting aside the arbitral award was made\n before elapse of three months from the receipt\n thereof. Three months from the date of receipt\n of the award expired on 26.11.2003. The\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 36 of 44\n\n\f District Court had Christmas vacation for the\n period from 25.12.2003 to 01.01.2004. On\n reopening of the Court i.e. on 02.01.2004, the\n appellants made application for setting aside\n the award under \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration\n Act. Considering the aforesaid facts and\n thereafter considering \nSections 2(j)\n and \n4\n of the\n Indian Limitation Act, 1963, this Court\n observed and held and concluded in\n paragraphs 11 to 15 as under:\n\n “11. The question, therefore, that falls for\n our determination is ­ whether the\n appellants are entitled to extension of time\n under \nSection 4\n of the 1963 Act in the\n above facts?\n\n 12. \nSection 4\n of the 1963 Act reads as\n under :­\n \"4. Expiry of prescribed period\n when court is closed.­ Where the\n prescribed period for any suit,\n appeal or application expires on a\n day when the court is closed, the\n suit, appeal or application may be\n instituted, preferred or made on the\n day when the court reopens.\n\n Explanation.­ A court shall be\n deemed to be closed on any day\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 37 of 44\n\n\f within the meaning of this section\n if during any part of its normal\n working hours it remains closed on\n that day.\"\n\n The above Section enables a party to\n institute a suit, prefer an appeal or make an\n application on the day court reopens where\n the prescribed period for any suit, appeal or\n application expires on the day when the\n court is closed.\n\n 13. The crucial words in \nSection 4\n of the\n 1963 Act are “prescribed period”. What is\n the meaning of these words?\n\n 14. \nSection 2(j)\n of the 1963 Act defines:\n\n “2(j) ‘period of limitation' [which] means the\n period of limitation prescribed for any suit,\n appeal or application by the Schedule, and\n 'prescribed period' means the period of\n limitation computed in accordance with the\n provisions of this Act.”\n\n \nSection 2(j)\n of the 1963 Act when read in\n the context of Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act,\n it becomes amply clear that the prescribed\n period for making an application for setting\n aside an arbitral award is three months.\n The period of 30 days mentioned in proviso\n that follows sub­section (3) of Section 34 of\n the 1996 Act is not the “period of limitation”\n and, therefore, not the “prescribed period”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 38 of 44\n\n\f for the purposes of making the application\n for setting aside the arbitral award. The\n period of 30 days beyond three months\n which the court may extend on sufficient\n cause being shown under the proviso\n appended to sub­section (3) of Section 34 of\n the 1996 Act being not the “period of\n limitation” or, in other words, the\n “prescribed period”, in our opinion, \nSection\n 4\n of the 1963 Act is not, at all, attracted to\n the facts of the present case.\n\n 15. Seen thus, the applications made by the\n appellants on 2­1­2004 for setting aside the\n arbitral award dated 26­8­2003 were liable\n to be dismissed and have rightly been\n dismissed by the District Judge, Kamrup,\n Guwahati, as time­barred.”\n\n Therefore, as such the question involved\n in the present appeal is squarely answered\n against the appellant and the said issue is as\n such not res integra.\n\n \n8. Now, so far as the submission on behalf of the\n appellant that the \nLimitation Act\n shall not be\n applicable to the proceedings under the\n \nArbitration Act\n is concerned, the aforesaid has\n no substance. \nSection 43(1)\n of the Arbitration\n Act specifically provides that \nLimitation Act\n,\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 39 of 44\n\n\f 1963 shall apply to arbitrations as it applies to\n proceeding in Court. However, as observed and\n held by this Court in the case of \nAssam Urban\n\n (Supra), \nLimitation Act, 1963\n shall be\n applicable to the matters of arbitration covered\n by 1996 Act save and except to the extent its\n applicability has been excluded by virtue of\n express provision contained in \nSection 34(3)\n of\n the Arbitration Act.\n\n8.1 In the case of Popular Construction Co.\n\n (Supra), when \nsection 5\n of the Limitation Act\n was pressed into service to proceedings under\n \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act for setting\n aside the arbitral award, this Court has\n observed that the \nArbitration Act\n being a\n special law and provides a period of limitation\n different from that prescribed under the\n \nLimitation Act\n, the period of limitation\n prescribed under the \nArbitration Act\n shall\n prevail and shall be applicable and to that\n extent the \nLimitation Act\n shall be excluded.\n That, thereafter, it is observed and held that\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 40 of 44\n\n\f application challenging an award filed beyond\n period mentioned in \nSection 34(3)\n of the\n Arbitration Act would not be an application “in\n accordance with” sub­section (3) as required\n under \nSection 34(1)\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n8.2 In the case of \nHindustan Construction\n Company Ltd.\n (Supra), in fact this Court has\n emphasized the mandatory nature of limit to\n the extension of period provided in proviso to\n Section 34(3) and has held that an application\n for setting aside an arbitral award under\n \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration Act has to be\n made within time prescribed under sub­section\n (3) of Section 34 i.e. within three months and a\n further period of 30 days on sufficient cause\n being shown and not thereafter.\n\n \n9. Now, so far as reliance placed upon \nSection 10\n\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897 on behalf of\n the appellant is concerned, at the outset it is\n required to be noted that such a contention is\n untenable in light of the proviso to \nSection 10\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 41 of 44\n\n\f of the \nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897\n, which\n specifically excludes the application of \nSection\n 10\n of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to any act\n or proceeding to which the Indian Limitation\n Act, 1877 applies. Reference to 1877 Act will\n now have to be read as reference to \nLimitation\n Act, 1963\n in view of \nSection 8\n of the General\n Clauses Act, 1897. Therefore, in light of the\n application of \nLimitation Act, 1963\n to the\n proceedings under the \nArbitration Act\n and\n when \nSection 10\n of the General Clauses Act,\n 1897 specifically excludes the applicability of\n \nSection 10\n to any act or proceeding to which\n \nIndian Limitation Act, 1963\n applies and in\n light of the definition of “period of limitation” as\n defined under \nSection 2(j)\n read with \nSection 4\n\n of the Limitation Act and as observed and held\n by this Court in the case of \nAssam Urban\n\n (Supra), benefit of exclusion of period during\n which the Court is closed shall be available\n when the application for setting aside award is\n filed within “prescribed period of limitation”\n and shall not be available in respect of period\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 42 of 44\n\n\f extendable by Court in exercise of its\n discretion.\n\n \n10. Now, so far as the reliance placed upon\n the decision of this Court in the case of \nSridevi\n Datla vs. Union of India\n reported in (2021) 5\n SCC 321 relied upon on behalf of the appellant\n is concerned, at the outset it is required to be\n noted that in \nthe said decision\n, this Court has\n not noticed the decision in the case of \nAssam\n Urban\n (Supra) and there is no discussion on\n distinction between “prescribed period” and the\n “discretionary condonable period”.\n \nOn the\n other hand, the binding decision of this Court\n in the case of \nAssam Urban\n (Supra) is directly\n on point.\n\n11. \nIn view of the above and for the reasons stated\n above, applying the law \nlaid down by\n this\n Court in the case of \nAssam Urban\n (Supra), it\n cannot be said that the High Court and the\n learned III Additional District & Sessions\n Judge, Vijaypur have committed any error in\n\nCivil Appeal No. 6810 of 2022 Page 43 of 44\n\n\f refusing to condone the delay caused in\n preferring application under \nSection 34\n of the\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which\n was beyond the period prescribed under\n \nSection 34(3)\n of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996. Under the\n circumstances, the present Appeal deserves to\n be dismissed and is, accordingly, dismissed. In\n the facts and circumstances of the case, there\n shall be no order as to costs.\n\n …………………………………J.\n (M. R.
