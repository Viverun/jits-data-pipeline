Bopanna\n\n 1\n\n REPORTABLE\n\n IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2913-2915 OF 2018\n\n PRASANTA KUMAR SAHOO & ORS. ….APPELLANT(S)\n\n VERSUS\n\n CHARULATA SAHU & ORS. ….RESPONDENT(S)\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n J. B. PARDIWALA, J.\n\n 1. Since the issues involved in both the captioned appeals are interrelated; the\n parties are also same and the challenge is also to the self-same judgment and decree\n passed by the High Court of Orissa, those were taken up for hearing analogously and\n are being disposed of by this common judgment and order.\n\n 2. Both the captioned appeals are at the instance of the legal representatives and\n heirs of the original defendant No. 1 (Late Shri Prafulla Sahoo S/o Kumar Sahoo) and\n are directed against the judgment, order and decree passed by a Division Bench of the\n High Court of Orissa at Cuttack dated 5.05.2011 in AHO No. 133 of 2000 by which the\n Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the\n appellants herein thereby affirming the judgment and decree of partition passed by the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nManish Issrani\n\n Trial Court in the Title Suit No. 348 of 1980 instituted by the original plaintiff\n\nDate: 2023.03.29\n\n15:55:18 IST\n\nReason:\n\n (Respondent No. 1 herein) and on the other hand allowed the cross-objections filed by\n\n\f 2\n\nthe Original Defendant No. 2, thereby setting aside and declaring the compromise\nrecorded by the First Appellate Court entered into between the Late Prafulla Sahoo and\nhis sister i.e., the Defendant No. 2 in the suit to be invalid.\n\nFACTUAL MATRIX\n\n3. This litigation relates to the partition of ancestral properties of one Kumar Sahoo,\nbetween the appellants who are the legal representatives and heirs of the Defendant No.\n1 (Late Mr. Prafulla Sahoo S/o of Kumar Sahoo), the Respondent No. 1 herein i.e., the\nPlaintiff (Mrs. Charulata Sahoo daughter of Kumar Sahoo) and the Respondent No. 2\nwho are the legal representatives and heirs of the Defendant No. 2 (Mrs. Santilata D/o\nKumar Sahoo)\n\n4. For the sake of convenience, the relationship of the parties will appear from the\nfollowing genealogical table, drawn as under: -\n\n Hadibandhu\n\n Dhruba Kumar Ananta Rohita\n\n Charulata Santilata (Dead) Prafulla (Dead)\n (Plaintiff) (Defendant No.2) (Defendant No.1)\n (Respondent No.1) (Respondent No.2) (Appellant)\n\n5. It appears from the materials on record that sometime in 1940 upon partition\nLate Shri Kumar Sahoo i.e., the father of the Plaintiff, Defendant No. 1 and Defendant\nNo. 2 resply as a co-parcener received the subject properties. In 1969, when Shri Kumar\nSahoo passed away, he was survived by the Plaintiff and Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 resply.\n\n6. On 3.12.1980, the Respondent No. 1 (herein Original Plaintiff) filed a suit for\npartition being the T.S. No. 348 of 1980, claiming 1/3rd share in the properties ‘A’ to\n‘F’ as scheduled in the plaint.\n\n\f 3\n\n7. The Respondent No. 1 (herein Original Plaintiff) prayed for the following reliefs\nin the title suit No. 348 of 1980 referred to above:\n\n“(i) Let a preliminary decree be passed for partition in respect of the plaintiff’s 1/3rd\nshare in schedule 'A' to 'F' and the plaintiff be put in specific possession of the same on\na separate allotment being curved out in final decree proceeding by appointment of\nCivil Court Survey knowing commissioner and a decree for mesne profit be passed\nagainst Defendant No. 1 from 1977 till the date of the suit and from the date of suit till\nthe decree is made final and the share of Defendant No. 1 in the suit properties be\ncharged for payment of the same.\n\n(ii) Let the Defendant No. 1 be permanently restrained from interfering with the\nplaintiff’s separate allotment in the final decree proceeding at any time in future.\n\n(iii) Let a degree be passed for the costs of the suit against the Defendants.\n\n(iv) Let a decree be passed for such other relief that the plaintiff is ultimately found\nentitled in his favour against the Defendants.\n\n DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPERTIES\n\n SCHEDULE-A\n\n1.

The Trial Court framed the following issues:\n\n\f 6\n\n “(1) Is the suit maintainable in law?\n\n (2) Are the plaintiff and Defendant No. 2 members of the family of Defendant\n No. 1 in view of introduction of \nUrban Land Ceiling & Regulation Act, 1976\n,\n and can the plaintiff maintain a suit for partition of the suit property?\n\n (3) Is the suit property liable for partition among the parties?\n\n (4) What are the respective shares of the plaintiff, Defendant No. 1 and\n Defendant No. 2 in the suit property?\n\n (5) Which of the properties in suit are ancestral and self-acquired of Kumar\n Sahu?\n\n (6) What are the shares of plaintiff and Defendant No. 2 in the mesne profit\n and from what date they are entitled to the same?\n\n (7) Are the alienations made by different parties out of the suit property at\n different points of time to be adjusted to their respective shares?\n\n (8) Whether the settlement deed dated 20.07.1985 executed by late Nisamani\n Dei has been acted upon and are plaintiff and Defendant No. 2 bound by the\n same?\n\n (9) Was there sufficient joint family nucleus in the hand of Defendant No. 1\n for alleged construction of the estate of the joint family?\n\n (10) Whether the property of Khata No. 18 in Schedule E of the amended plaint\n is available for partition?\n\n (11) To what relief the parties are entitled?\n\n The trial court decreed the suit and observed that the plaintiff had one-sixth\n share in the ancestral property and one-third share in the separate property.\n The said decree is being challenged by Defendant No. 1.”\n\n9. The suit between the parties was adjudicated and vide the judgment and order\ndated 30.12.1986 the Civil Judge drew a preliminary decree as under:\n\n “ ORDER\n\n The suit is decreed preliminarily on contest against defendant No: 1 with\n costs an D-2 without cost. Plaintiff is entitled to 2 annas 8 pies (1/6th)\n share and 1/3rd share in respect of ancestral and self acquired properties\n\n\f 7\n\n and super structures thereon (Houses and buildings) respectively of Late\n Kumar Charan Sahu out of the suit properties. She is also entitled to the\n same share in respect of mense profits thereof, from the date of institution\n of the suit. Defendant No-2 is also entitled to same share of properties and\n mense profits. Defendant No: 1 is entitled to 10 annas 8 pies (2/3rd) and\n 1/3rd share in ancestral and self acquired properties respectively and\n superstructure thereon of Late Kumar Charan Sahu and mense profits\n thereof. An Amin Commissioner is to be deputed for effecting partition on\n the above basis who is the final decree proceeding will apportion shares\n on above basis after ascertaining the details of ancestral and self acquired\n properties an superstructures thereon and also the quantum of mense\n profits in the light of indications and finding reached on different issues\n discussed in the judgment. After ascertainment of such share plaintiff and\n Defendant No:2 are to be put in possession of such properties that would\n be allotted to them separately in consequence of the final decree\n proceeding. Hearing fee at contested useable.”\n\n10. Thus, the Trial Court directed that:\n\n (i) the properties listed in the Schedule ‘A’ to ‘F’ referred to above shall be\n considered as ancestral properties, while the properties listed in the\n Schedule ‘J’ (1 to 8 properties) were considered as the self-acquired\n properties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo.\n\n (ii) the Respondent No. 1 (herein Original Plaintiff) was held entitled to 1/6th\n share in the ancestral properties and 1/3rd share in the self-acquired\n properties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo. The Civil Court also directed that\n the plaintiff was entitled to mesne profits.\n\n (iii) similar shares and benefits accrued to the Defendant No. 2 (Respondent\n No. 2 herein)\n\n (iv) the Defendant No. 1 (the Plaintiff herein) was held entitled to 4/6 th share\n in the ancestral properties and 1/3rd share in the self-acquired properties\n of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo including the mesne profits.\n\n11. It is pertinent to note that as against the judgment and decree of the Trial Court\nreferred to above, it is only the Defendant No. 1, who thought fit to file F.A. No. 359\nof 1986 before the High Court of Orissa. This appeal was essentially filed on the ground\n\n\f 8\n\nthat all the properties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo, as scheduled in the plaint should have\nbeen held to be ancestral properties.\n\n12. It appears from the materials on record that while the first appeal referred to\nabove was pending before the High Court, the Defendant No. 2 (Respondent No. 2\nherein) entered into a settlement with the Defendant No.1 thereby relinquishing her\nshare in accordance with the decree passed by the Trial Court in lieu of consideration\nof Rs. 50, 000/- and the portions of land in Schedule ‘A’ and ‘B’. In such circumstances\nreferred to above, a compromise petition dated 29.03.1991 duly signed on affidavit by\nthe Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 resply, was filed before the High Court which came to be\nregistered as the Miscellaneous Case No. 643 of 1990 in F.A. No. 359 of 1986 referred\nto above.\n\n13. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, while disposing of the F.A. No. 359\nof 1986 observed as under:\n\n “4. In this appeal, it is first contended that certain properties having been\n given to the daughters by the father during his life time and certain properties\n having been gifted to them at the time of their marriage and certain other\n properties having been purchased by the father in the names of the two\n daughters, namely plaintiff and Defendant No. 2, they are not entitled to any\n separate share after death of the father.\n\n 5. There is no challenge as such to the validity of the gift deeds, if any,\n in favour of the daughters at the time of their marriage. There is also no\n material to indicate that certain properties had been purchased in the names\n of the daughters as name-lenders and actually the property belonged to the\n father. Therefore, even assuming that certain properties had been gifted and\n had been purchased in the names of plaintiff and Defendant No. 2, that cannot\n be a ground to negate the right of succession of the plaintiff and Defendant\n No. 2, which accrued after death of the father.\n\n 6. The learned counsel for the appellant also contended that some properties\n were self-acquired properties of Defendant No. 1 himself. A perusal of the\n written statement indicates that no such specific case had been made out in\n the written statement, nor any such material is available on record. In absence\n of any evidence worth the name, it is difficult to accept such a contention\n raised by the appellant.\n\n\f 9\n\n 7. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant then contended that during\n pendency of the appeal, a compromise has been effected between the present\n appellant and Respondent No. 2, wherein Respondent No.2 has given up her\n share in favour of Defendant No. 1. Since such compromise is otherwise lawful\n and it does not prejudicially affect the right of the plaintiff, it can be given\n effect to and the decree of the trial court is to be modified accordingly.”\n\n 8. Thus, though all other contentions of the appellant are not acceptable, in\n view of the compromise the decree of the trial court is modified to the extent\n that Defendant No. 1 shall also be entitled to the share of Respondent No. 2.\n\n In other words, he would be entitled to 5/6th share in the ancestral property\n and 2/3rd share in the separate properties as determined by the trial court. The\n decree of the trial court is modified to the above extent.\n\n 9. It appears that during the pendency of the appeal, receivers had been\n appointed at different times and presently Defendant No. 1-appellant is\n continuing as the receiver. It further appears that certain amounts have been\n deposited in this Court which have been kept in fixed deposit. The fixed\n deposit in this court shall be renewed from time to time for appropriate\n period to fetch maximum interest. The amount which is not yet kept in fixed\n deposit shall also be kept in fixed deposit in similar manner so that the\n amount can be disbursed in accordance with the direction to be made in the\n final decree after the final decree proceedings are over. If the parties do not\n come to any amicable arrangement, the plaintiff or Defendant No. 1 may\n initiate the final decree proceeding. The trial court after making necessary\n adjustment towards any justified expenditure, et cetera, shall pass a direction\n regarding disbursement of the amount in accordance with the shares now\n indicated in this judgment. The receiver shall henceforth act under the\n direction of the trial court and all necessary obligation relating to\n accounting and maintenance of the properties etc. shall be determined by the\n trial court and if any deposit is required to be made by the receiver, the same\n shall be made in the trial court which shall make similar arrangements\n regarding fixed deposits. Applications for removal of the receiver or for\n imposing any fresh conditions can be made before the trial court which is\n free to deal with all such applications.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n14. The Defendant No. 1 (Appellants herein) continued with the litigation by filing\nthe Letters Patent Appeal under Chapter VI of the Rules of High Court of Orissa, 1948.\nThe Letters Patent Appeal was filed essentially on the ground that the learned Single\nJudge of the High Court had failed to correctly adjudicate the issue whether some of\nthe properties as mentioned in the schedule to the plaint were self-acquired properties\nof Late Shri Kumar Sahoo or all the properties were ancestral properties.\n\n\f 10\n\n15. The Defendant No. 1 (Appellants) went in appeal before the Division Bench of\nthe High Court essentially on the ground that all the properties were ancestral as the\nsame are derived out of the same nucleus of the existing ancestral properties. The appeal\nbefore the Division Bench was registered as the Appeal bearing No. AHO No. 133 of\n2000.\n\n16. On 28.06.2001, the Defendant No. 2 (Respondent No. 2 herein) challenged the\nvalidity of the settlement deed referred to above vide cross appeal in the AHO No. 133\nof 2000.\n\n17. In the Letters Patent Appeal filed by the Appellants herein, the Court addressed\nitself on the following points of determination:\n\n “(i) whether the findings and reasons recorded on the contentious issues by\n the learned trial judge are either erroneous or error in law warranting\n interference by this Court in exercise of its power?\n\n (ii) whether the first appellate judge in not dealing with the grounds urged\n by the first defendant by framing appropriate point on the findings recorded\n on the contentious issues by the learned trial court, this court requires\n interference with the impugned judgment in this appeal though, this Court's\n jurisdiction in this Letter Patent Appeal is also analogous to the first\n appellate court?\n\n (iii) whether the findings recorded in issue no.5, holding that some of the\n schedule properties are self-acquired properties of late Kumar Sahoo is\n erroneous or error in law and liable to be interfered with by this Court in\n this appeal?\n\n (iv) whether the compromise petition filed by the counsel for defendants 1\n & 2 In the First Appeal without special authorization in their favour for\n signing the compromise petition by defendant no. 2, and plaintiff is not a\n party to the compromise petition, could have been accepted by the learned\n Single Judge and modified the judgment of the trial court in so far as the\n share assigned to the defendant no.2, the same is legal and valid?\n\n (v) what decree the parties are entitled to?”\n\n18. The Division Bench of the High Court vide its impugned judgment and order\ndated 5.05.2011 dismissed the appeal i.e., the AHO No. 133 of 2000 filed by the\n\n\f 11\n\nDefendant No. 1 (Appellant herein) and allowed the cross appeal filed by the Defendant\nNo. 2. Thus, the Division Bench of the High Court set at naught the compromise entered\ninto between the Defendants.\n\n19. In such circumstances referred to above, the Appellants (Legal heirs of the\nOriginal Defendant No. 1) are here before this Court with the present appeals.\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS\n\n20. Mr. R. Basant, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants\nvehemently submitted that the courts below committed a serious error in recording a\nfinding that the properties in Schedule ‘J’ (1 to 8 properties) were self-acquired\nproperties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo. According to Mr. Basant all the properties\ndevolving upon the Plaintiff and Defendants are ancestral in nature.\n\n21. It was submitted that there is nothing on record to indicate that Late Shri Kumar\nSahoo had any independent source of income through which, he during his lifetime had\nacquired certain properties which, does not form part of the ancestral properties.\nAccording to Mr. Basant, the J series properties (1 to 8 properties) were bought by Late\nShri Kumar Sahoo with the aid of the income derived from the ancestral properties and\nin such circumstances, the J series (1 to 8 properties) would form part of the same\nnucleus of existing ancestral properties which could now be said to have been devolved\non the Plaintiff and the Defendants as ancestral properties.\n\n22. Mr. Basant, thereafter, addressed the Court on the effect of the \nHindu Succession\n(Amendment) Act, 2005\n (for short, ‘the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n’ or ‘2005 Amendment’)\nto the \nHindu Succession Act, 1956\n (for short, ‘the Act 1956’). He submitted that the\nRespondent should not be allowed to raise the plea of effecting rights under the\namendment to \nSection 6\n of the Act 1956 after these many years. He further submitted\nthat assuming for the moment that the 2005 Amendment has altered the rights of the\nparties, more particularly, the sisters as co-parceners, however, in view of the\nsettlement deed, the rights of the Respondent No. 2 (herein Original Defendant No. 2)\ncould be said to have been extinguished and transferred to the Appellants. He submitted\n\n\f 12\n\nthat the transfer by the Defendant No. 2 of her entire share in favour of the Defendant\nNo. 1 would be a disposition of her share/rights in the suit properties. The disposition\nwhich took place in 1991 cannot be permitted to be unsettled in view of the 2005\nAmendment.\n\n23. He submitted that the retrospective effect of the 2005 Amendment would cause\nhavoc to the alienation made between 1965 and 2005 and in such circumstances, the\nrights of the Respondent No. 1 (Plaintiff), if any, would accrue to the heirs qua the\nunalienated/encumbered ancestral property, as available with the nucleus of the joint\nfamily property with effect from 20.12.2004 only.\n\n24. Mr. Basant submitted that as the alienations which might have been taken place\nprior to 20.12.2004 cannot be reopened in order to ascertain which properties are\navailable for partition, the matter should be remitted to the Trial Court.\n\n25. He further submitted that in accordance with the proviso to sub-section (1) of\n\nSection 6\n of the Act 1956 (as amended on 9.09.2005) no disposition or alienation\nincluding partition or testamentary disposition of property which took place before\n20.12.2004 shall be invalidated or set aside on account of the 2005 Amendment.\n\n26. Mr. Basant in support of his aforesaid submission invited the attention of this\nCourt to the decision of this Court in the case of \nVineeta Sharma v. Rakesh Sharma\nand Others\n reported in (2020) 9 SCC 1, more particularly, the observations in para 76\nat page 58, which reads thus:\n\n “76. It was argued that in case Parliament intended that the incident of\n birth prior to 2005 would be sufficient to confer the status of a coparcener,\n Parliament would need not have enacted the proviso to \nSection 6(1)\n. When\n we read the provisions conjointly, when right is given to the daughter of a\n coparcener in the same manner as a son by birth, it became necessary to\n save the dispositions or alienations, including any partition or testamentary\n succession, which had taken place before 20-12-2004. A daughter can\n assert the right on and from 9-9-2005, and the proviso saves from\n invalidation the above transactions.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\f 13\n\n27. Mr. Basant submitted that there was no good reason for the High Court to look\ninto the validity and execution of the settlement deed between the Defendant Nos. 1\nand 2 resply. If all the properties are considered to be ancestral, the Plaintiff is entitled\nto 1/6th share of the total ancestral properties, while the Defendant No. 1 would be\nentitled to 5/6th share of the total ancestral property. He submitted that in the event, it\nis determined that the J series properties (1 to 8 properties) are in fact self-acquired,\nthen the Plaintiff is entitled to 1/6th share of the ancestral property and 1/3rd share of the\nself-acquired property, while the Defendant No. 1 would be entitled to 5/6th share of\nthe total ancestral property and 2/3rd share of the self-acquired property.\n\n28. In support of his submission that the settlement between Defendant Nos. 1 and\n2 resply was lawful, just and proper, he relied on the following decisions of this Court:\n\n(\ni) Bai Chanchal and Others v. Syed Jalaluddin and Others\n reported in (1970) 3\nSCC 124 at para 8,\n\n(\nii) Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India and Others\n reported in (1992)\n1 SCC 31 at para 38-41,\n\n(\niii) D.S. Lakshmaiah and Another v. L. Balasubramanyam and Another\n reported\nin (2003) 10 SCC 310 at para 18,\n\n(iv) Jineshwardas (Dead) by LRs. and Others v. Jagrani (Smt) and Another\nreported in (2003) 11 SCC 372 at para 7-8 and\n\n(v) Pushpa Devi Bhagat (Dead) through \nLR. Sadhna Rai (Smt) v. Rajinder Singh\nand Others\n reported in (2006) 5 SCC 566 at paras 18, 19, 23-25.\n\n29. \nIn such circumstances \nreferred to above\n, Mr. Basant prays that there being merit\nin his appeals, the same may be allowed and the impugned judgment and order passed\nby the High Court be modified accordingly.\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NO. 1 (ORIGINAL\nPLAINTIFF)\n\n\f 14\n\n30. Ms. B. Sunita Rao, the learned counsel appearing for the Respondent No. 1\n(Original Plaintiff) vehemently submitted that no error not to speak of any error of law\ncould be said to have been committed by the High Court in passing the impugned\njudgment and decree. She submitted that in view of the decision of this Court in the\ncase of \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra) the Plaintiff is now entitled to 1/3 rd share in all the\nproperties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo, which were available at the time of filing of the\nsuit.\n \nShe submitted that in view of the decision of this Court, in the case of \nGanduri\nKoteshwaramma and Another v. Chakiri Yanadi and Another\n reported in (2011) 9\nSCC 788, the preliminary decree can be awarded/altered or modified in the event of the\nchanged circumstances, even if no appeal has been filed.\n\n31. The learned counsel further submitted that in view of the amendment of 2005 to\n\nSection 6\n of the Act 1956 and the decision of this Court in case of \nVineeta Sharma\n\n(supra) the daughters are entitled to equal share with that of the son in the coparcenary\nproperties. The Plaintiff being one of the daughters of Late Kumar Sahoo is entitled to\na larger and equal share in the ancestral property and in such circumstances the decree\nnow needs to be modified on account of the operation of law.\n\n32. The learned counsel submitted that the Plaintiff and Defendants are now each\nentitled to 1/3rd share of both ancestral and self-acquired properties of Late Kumar\nSahoo. While explaining the true import of the operation of the amended provision of\n\nSection 6(1)\n of the Act 1956, she submitted that the alienations before 20.12.2004 are\npermitted but the property alienated would fall to the share of the co-parcener, who\nmade the alienation, if no legal binding necessity is proved. The learned counsel pointed\nout that the Trial Court has held that alienation would be a part of the share of the\nDefendant No. 1. She submitted that any alienation after the date of filing of the suit\nwould be hit by the doctrine of lis pendens. The alienation prior to the filing of the suit\nwas considered by the Trial Court and specific finding in that regard has been recorded.\n\n33. It was pointed out that out of 4.408 acres of land in Schedule ‘A’ and ‘B’\nproperties, the unencumbered property available for immediate division is 3.762 acres\n(around 94 guntas). It was also pointed out that full extent of the suit properties in\n\n\f 15\n\nSchedule ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’ and ‘F’ resply are available for division, as at the time of the\npreliminary decree.\n\n34. As regards the settlement between the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2, the learned\ncounsel submitted that the Plaintiff was never a part of the compromise. No notice was\nissued to her nor she had put her signature on any part of the compromise deed or had\nagreed to the terms of the compromise. According to the learned counsel, the Plaintiff\nnever joined in the settlement. On the issue of disbursement of the receivership amount\ndeposited in the Court, the counsel submitted that the Plaintiff is 84 years old and has\nfiled multiple IAs being IA No. 44977 of 2013, IA No. 127171 of 2019 and IA No.\n190628 of 2022 resply in the present proceedings for disbursement of her 1/3 rd share in\nthe amount already deposited by the receiver. It was submitted that the Plaintiff does\nnot have any independent source of income and has to incur a lot of expenditure towards\nmedical treatment etc.\n\n35. In the written submissions filed by the learned counsel appearing for the\nRespondent No. 1, the defaults alleged to have been committed by the Defendant No.\n1 as narrated in IA No. 190628 of 2022 has been highlighted as under:\n\n “1. Modification of the superstructures on suit property without leave of\n the Court. (Relevant page 10-13 of IA)\n\n 2. Dues with regard to suit properties:\n\n a. Water Bills - Rs. 51,478/-\n b. Revenue Tax - Rs. 80,733/-\n c. Electricity Bills - Rs.1,89,228.84\n total Rs. 3,21,439.84\n (Relevant page 14-15 of IA)\n\n 3.

A case for authorized construction on suit properties has been\n instituted by Cuttack Development Authority being U.C. No.\n 249/2016. (Relevant Page 23 of IA)”\n\n36. The learned counsel vehemently submitted that the Defendant No. 2 should be\nremoved as a receiver forthwith and the Plaintiff should be appointed as the receiver of\nthe properties.\n\nSUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT NOS. 3, 4, 5, 7 AND 8\nRESPLY (LEGAL HEIRS OF THE ORIGINAL DEFENDANT NO. 2)\n\n37. Mr. V. Chitambaresh, the learned Senior Counsel addressed himself on four\nissues:\n\n (i) Whether the properties as scheduled in the plaint are ancestral or self-\n\n acquired properties of the predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff and\n defendants 1 and 2 and what share the parties are entitled to?\n\n (ii) Whether a cross-appeal is maintainable for the purpose of challenging\n the alleged compromise?\n\n (iii) Whether the alleged settlement deed dated 28.03.1991 is valid and\n binding under order XXIII \nRule 3 Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 (for\n short, ‘\nthe CPC\n’)?\n\n (iv) Whether the compromise was acted upon by the Defendant Nos. 1 and\n 2?\n\n (v) Whether the counsel can sign the Compromise Petition without an\n express consent?\n\n38. On the first issue, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that there is a concurrent\nfinding on the nature of the suit properties recorded by all the three courts i.e., the Trial\nCourt, the Single Judge of the High Court and the Division Bench of the High Court.\n\n\f 17\n\nHe would submit that the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant No. 2 being daughters and\nco-parceners are entitled to equal share in the ancestral properties as along with their\nbrother i.e., the Defendant No. 1 (Appellant). He would submit that the law in this\nregard is now well settled as explained by this Court in the case of \nVineeta Sharma\n\n(supra).\n \nRelying on the decision of this Court, in the case of \nGanduri Koteshwaramma\n\n(supra) he submitted that even if no appeal has been filed by the Plaintiff and the\nDefendant, the shares will have to be determined in accordance with the amendment\nand the law as \nlaid down in\n \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra). Over and above the share\nreckoned in the alleged compromise in dispute, the Defendant No. 2 would be entitled\nto additional 1/6th share in the ancestral property.\n\n39. On the second issue \nreferred to above\n, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that\na cross-appeal is maintainable for the purpose of challenging the compromise. He\nsubmitted that a cross-appeal under \nOrder XLI Rule 22 of the CPC\n is as good as a\nregular first appeal and the same would be maintainable, even if, the regular first appeal\nis dismissed or withdrawn. A cross-appeal is an exercise of substantive right of appeal\nand only the procedure would vary.\n\n40. The learned Senior Counsel also invited the attention of this Court to the\nprovisions of Order XLIII Rule 1-A (2) \nof the CPC\n. He would submit that the cross-\nobjector is entitled under \nOrder XLI Rule 22 of the CPC\n read with Order XLIII Rule 1-\nA (2) \nof the CPC\n to contend in his or her cross-appeal that the alleged settlement deed\nor agreement should not have been reckoned as a valid compromise and recorded under\n\nOrder XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC\n.\n\n41. In such circumstances \nreferred to above\n, the learned Senior Counsel prays that\nthere being no merit in the appeals the same may be dismissed and the shares of the\nparties be determined in accordance with the 2005 Amendment.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n42. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having gone\nthrough the materials on record, the following questions fall for our consideration:\n\n\f 18\n\n(i) In what manner, the rights of the parties would be governed keeping in mind the\ndictum as laid by this Court in its decision in the case of \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra)\n\n(ii) Whether the High Court was justified in declaring the settlement between the\nappellants herein (Defendant No. 1) and Respondent No. 2 (Defendant No. 1) as\ninvalid? In other words, whether the High Court was right in allowing the cross-appeal\nfiled by the Original Defendant No. 2 (Respondent No. 2 herein).\n\n43. Before adverting to the rival submission canvassed on either side, we should give\na fair idea as regards the history and development of Hindu Law as well as look at the\nLaw Commission Report, Report of the Standing Committee of Parliament and the\nStatement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill introduced in Parliament with the purpose\nof finding out the true intent of the Parliament in amending \nSection 6\n of the Act 1956\nby the 2005 Amendment.\n\n44. We have traced the history and development of Hindu Law from a Full Bench\ndecision of the Bombay High Court, in the case of Badrinarayan Shankar Bhandari\nand Others v. Omprakash Shankar Bhandari reported in AIR 2014 Bom 151 (FB).\n\nOld Hindu Law\n\n45. Before the enactment of the Principal Act, Hindus were covered by shastric and\ncustomary law which varied from region to region. Principally, there were two schools\nof Hindu Law in India i.e. Dayabhaga which was prevalent in eastern part of India i.e.\nBengal and the adjoining areas and Mitakshara which was prevalent in the rest of India.\nUnder the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law, woman in a joint Hindu family had merely\na right of maintenance/ sustenance but had no right of inheritance to property. The basis\nof Hindu joint family was a common male ancestor and the properties of the family\nwere held as a coparcenary property with male member of the family having a right to\nthe property by virtue of birth and their interest in the coparcenary property would keep\nvarying depending upon the death or a birth of a male in the joint Hindu Family. The\nproperty of a male coparcener on his death used to pass by survivorship in the\nMitakshara School of Hindu Law. No female is a member of the coparcenary though,\n\n\f 19\n\nshe is a member of the joint Hindu family. The coparcenary would normally consist up\nto four degrees i.e. the common ancestor (coparcener), his son, grandson and great\ngrandson.\n\n46. Under the Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law, the daughters also got equal share\nalong with their brothers. Under the Dayabhaga School property is transmitted by\nSuccession and not by Survivorship. In this School, a female could be a coparcener. So\nfar as the Dayabhaga School was concerned, there was no concept of a coparcenary\nproperty and every member of a Hindu family would hold property in his/her own right\nand was entitled to dispose of the property as he/she deems fit either by gift or Will.\nThere was no concept of passing of property by survivorship nor did a Hindu male in\nDayabhaga School acquire rights to property merely by virtue of his birth.\nConsequently, women had a right equal to the rights to that of men belonging to the\nfamily in the Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law.\n\n47. The earliest legislation with regard to right of female inheritance was made in\n1929 called the Hindu Law of Inheritance Act, 1929. \nThis Act\n conferred inheritance\nright to three female heirs- son's-daughter, daughter's-daughter and sister. Thus,\nbringing about restrictions on the exclusive Rule of Survivorship. The next legislation\nwas the Hindu Women’s Right to Property Act 1937. \nThis Act\n enabled the widow to\nsucceed along with the son of the deceased in equal share to the property of her\ndeceased husband. However, the widow was entitled only to limited estate in the\nproperty i.e. life estate and could not dispose of the property during her life time.\n\n48. In 1950, while framing the Constitution, \nArticles 14\n, 15(2)\n \n& (3)\n and \n16\n of the\nConstitution of India, sought inter alia to restrain practice of discrimination against\nwomen and made equal treatment of women a part of the fundamental rights guaranteed\nunder the Constitution. In line with the above Constitutional objective, the Parliament\nenacted the \nHindu Succession Act,1956\n i.e. the Principal Act. \nThis Act\n applies to all\nHindus including Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs. It lays down a uniform and\ncomprehensive system of inheritance and applies to all Hindus, whether governed by\n\n\f 20\n\nMitakshara or Dayabhaga School of Hindu Law. However, Section 6 of the Principal\nAct as originally enacted retained substantially the Rule of passing of property in a\ncoparcenary by survivorship, although it did give rights of testamentary disposition to\nHindu males in respect of his properties including his coparcenary share. The erstwhile\nSection 6 of the Principal Act (pre-amended \nSection 6\n) inter alia provided that the\ninterest of a coparcener in the coparcenary property if not disposed of by Will under\nSection 30 of the Principal Act, would devolve in terms of pre-amended \nSection 6\n. The\nmain part of pre-amended \nSection 6\n provided that the right of male Hindu at the time\nof his death in the coparcenary property will devolve by survivorship. However, the\nproviso provided that if the deceased coparcener has any female relatives specified in\n\nClass I of the Schedule to the Act\n, then the property will devolve in terms of pre-\namended \nSection 6\n. The Explanation 1 provides that there would be notional partition\nimmediately before his death so as to allocate the share in the coparcenary to the\ndeceased coparcener.\n\n49. It is interesting to note that the Hindu Code Bill wanted to do away with the\nMitakshara coparcenary completely. However, the same was opposed to and the\nerstwhile \nSection 6\n was enacted in the Principal Act. Consequently, if a partition took\nplace in the coparcenary property, then each male coparcener would get his share and\nthe mother and wife/widow would not become a coparcener but would get a share in\nthe coparcenary property. But a daughter would get no share in the coparcenary\nproperty. The daughter would only get a share as one of the heirs on the death of\ncoparcener, out of the share of the deceased in the coparcenary property on notional\npartition, in view of proviso to pre-amended Section 8 of the Principal Act. In terms of\nSection 30 of the Principal Act, a Hindu male can dispose of his entire property\nincluding his interest in coparcenary property by testamentary disposition/ Will and\nalso in the process deprive his female heirs of any share.\n\nMaking of Amendment Act, 2005\n\n\f 21\n\n50. Keeping the aforesaid position of Hindu Law, in its 174 th Report (May 2000),\nthe Law Commission of India was of the view that the gender reforms were called for\nto ensure equality. The Commission noted the fact that in various States such as Kerala,\nAndhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka, attempts had already been\nmade to bring about the gender equality. But all these States, except Kerala, while\nconferring coparcenary rights on daughters also denied such rights to daughters married\nprior to State Acts coming into force.\n\n51. The Law Commission recommended that the daughter should be made\ncoparcener by birth and that she should be entitled to get a share on partition and/or on\nthe death of the male coparcener. The Commission also recommended that a daughter\nwho is married after the commencement of the Amendment Act, should be entitled to\na share in the ancestral property as she has already become a coparcener prior to her\nmarriage. One more recommendation of the Law Commission was to do away with the\nerstwhile Section 23 of the Principal Act which provided that a woman would have a\nright to stay in the family house as a member of the joint Hindu Family but unlike a\nmale, she would have no right to demand a partition of the family house. The\nCommission recommended that she should have rights equal to the male in respect of\na family house.\n\n52. The Law commission also observed that the Law of Succession falls under Entry\nV of the List III (concurrent list) in VII Schedule of the Constitution. In view of \nArticle\n246\n of the Constitution of India the laws made by the above mentioned five States,\nwould stand repealed to the extent they are repugnant to the Principal Act on\namendment.\n\n53. On 20th December, 2004, the Hindu Succession Amendment Bill 2004 was\nintroduced in the Rajyasabha, inter alia, seeking to amend the erstwhile \nSection 6\n and\ndoing away/omitting the erstwhile Section 23 of the Principal Act.\n\n “Statement of Objects and Reasons for amending the ‘Principal Act’ read\n as follows:-\n\n\f 22\n\nSTATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n\nThe Hindu Succession Act, 1956 has amended and codified the law relating\nto intestate succession Hindus and gave rights which were till then unknown\nin relation to women's property. However, it does not interfere with the\nspecial rights of those who are members of Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary\nexcept to provide rules for devolution of the interest of a deceased male in\ncertain cases. \nThe Act\n-lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of\ninheritance and applies, inter alia, to persons governed by the Mitakshara\nand Dayabhaga schools and also to those governed previously by the\nMurumakkattayam, Aliyasantana and Nambudir laws.”\n\nThe Act\n applies to every person who is a Hindu by 28 of 72 SA.566.2011\nreligion in any of its forms or developments including a Virashaiva, a\nLingayat or a follower of the Brahmo, Parathana or Arya Samaj; or to any\nperson who is Buddhist, Jain or Sikh by religion; or to any other person\nwho is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or Jew by religion. In the case of a\ntestamentary disposition, this Act does not apply and the interest of the\ndeceased is governed by the \nIndian Succession Act, 1925\n.\n\n2. \nSection 6\n of the Act deals with devolution of interest of a male Hindu in\ncoparcenary property and recognizes the rule of devolution by survivorship\namong the members of the coparcenary. The retention of the Mitakshara\ncoparcenary property without including the females in it means that the\nfemales cannot inherit in ancestral property as their male counterparts to.\n\nThe law by excluding the daughter from participating in the coparcenary\nownership not only contributes to her discrimination on the ground of\ngender but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right\nof equality guaranteed by the Constitution. Having regard to the need of\nrender social justice to women, the States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,\nKarnataka and Maharashtra have made necessary changes in the law\ngiving equal right to daughters in Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property.\nThe Kerala Legislature has enacted the \nKerala Joint Hindu Family System\n(Abolition) Act, 1975\n.\n\n3. It is proposed to remove the discrimination as contained in \nsection 6\n of\nthe Hindu Succession Act, 1956 by giving equal rights to daughters in the\nHindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. \nSection 23\n of the\nAct disentitles a female heir to ask for partition in respect of a dwelling\nhouse wholly occupied by a joint family until the male heirs choose to divide\ntheir respective shares therein. It is also proposed to omit the said section\nso as to remove the disability on female heirs contained in that section.”\n\n\f 23\n\n 4. The above proposals are based on the recommendations of the Law\n Commission of India as contained in its 174th Report on 'Property Rights\n of Women: Proposed Reform under the Hindu Law.\n\n 5. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n54. The Bill inter alia provided in proviso to proposed \nSection 6(1)\n that\nthe Amendment Act would not apply to a daughter married before the commencement\nof the Amendment Act and also that the Amendment Act will have no application to a\npartition in case the partition had been affected before the commencement of\nthe Amendment Act. The aforesaid Bill was thereafter referred to the Standing\ncommittee of Parliament. The Standing Committee after recording the historical growth\nof Hindu Law and Gender inequality with regard to the property right practiced against\na female Hindu suggested that proviso 1 to proposed \nSection 6(1)\n of the Bill which\nsought to exclude the daughter married before the commencement of the Amendment\nAct from the benefit of the Act should be done away with.\n\n55. The Standing Committee also suggested that the partition of the Hindu family\nproperty should be properly defined in the Amendment Act. It was suggested that\npartition for all purposes should be either by registered documents or by decree of\nCourt. However, where oral partition is pleaded, the same should be backed by evidence\nin support. Further omission of \nSection 23\n as suggested by the Law Commission, will\nenable the Hindu Women to seek partition of a family house occupied by the family\nmembers just as male member could seek partition.\n\n56. Thereafter, on 9.09.2005, the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n came to be passed as Act\n39 of 2005. \nSection 3\n of the Amendment Act, 2005 substituted erstwhile Section 6 of\nthe Principal Act. \nThe Amendment Act, 2005\n did away with exclusion of married\ndaughter from getting the benefit of the amendment and also added a proviso to Section\n6(1) of the Principal Act saving partitions done prior to 20.12.2004 (the date of\nintroduction of the Bill in Rajya Sabha). The Explanation to \nSection 6(5)\n of the\n\n\f 24\n\nPrincipal Act provided that for the purposes of the \nSection 6\n of the Act partition only\nmeans partition by registered document or decree of Court.\n\n57. Before averting to the rival submissions canvassed on either side, it would be\napposite to reproduce the erstwhile \nSection 6\n as appearing in the Principal Act and the\namended Section 6 of the Principal Act, as substituted by Section 3 of the Amendment\nAct for the sake of convenience. The pre-amended Section 6 of the Principal Act reads\nas under:\n\n “\nSection 6\n:- Devolution of interest in coparcenary property - when a male\n Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at the time of his\n death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary property, his interest in the\n property shall devolve by survivorship upon the surviving members of the\n coparcenary and not in accordance with this Act;\n\n Provided that, if the deceased had left him surviving a female relative\n specified in class I of the Schedule or a male relative specified in that class\n who claims through such female relative, the interest of the deceased in the\n Mitakshara coparcenary property shall devolve by testamentary or\n intestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and not by\n survivorship.\n\n Explanation 1 - For the purposes of this section, the interest of a Hindu\n Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that\n would have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken\n place immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled\n to claim partition or not.\n\n Explanation 2 - Nothing contained in the proviso to this section shall be\n construed as enabling a person who has separated himself from the\n coparcenary before the death of the deceased or any of his heirs to claim\n on intestacy a share in the interest referred to therein.”\n\n58. The substituted Section 6 of the Principal Act as amended by the \nAmendment\nAct, 2005\n which is in force w.e.f. 9.09.2005 reads as under:\n\n “6. Devolution of interest of coparcenary property.—\n (1) On and from the commencement of the \nHindu Succession (Amendment)\n Act, 2005\n, in a Joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law, the\n daughter of a coparcener shall,\n\n (a) by birth become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as\n the son;\n\n\f 25\n\n(b) have the same rights in the coparcenary property as she would have had\nif she had been a son;\n\n(c) be subject to the same liabilities in respect of the said coparcenary\nproperty as that of a son, and any reference to a Hindu Mitakshara\ncoparcener shall be deemed to include a reference to a daughter of a\ncoparcener:\n\nProvided that nothing contained in this sub-\n\nsection shall affect or invalidate any disposition or alienation including any\npartition or testamentary disposition of property which had taken place\nbefore the 20th day of December, 2004.\n\n(2) Any property to which a female Hindu becomes entitled by virtue of sub-\n\nsection (1) shall be held by her with the incidents of coparcenary ownership\nand shall be regarded, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or\nany other law for the time being in force in, as property capable of being\ndisposed of by her by testamentary disposition.\n\n(3) Where a Hindu dies after the commencement of the \nHindu Succession\n(Amendment) Act, 2005\n, his interest in the property of a Joint Hindu family\ngoverned by the Mitakshara law, shall devolve by testamentary or intestate\nsuccession, as the case may be, under this Act and not by survivorship, and\nthe coparcenary property shall be deemed to have been divided as if a\npartition had taken place and,--\n\n(a) the daughter is allotted the same share as is allotted to a son;\n\n(b) the share of the pre-deceased son or a pre- deceased daughter, as they\nwould have got had they been alive at the time of partition, shall be allotted\nto the surviving child of such pre-deceased son or of such pre-deceased\ndaughter; and\n\n(c) the share of the pre-deceased child of a pre-deceased son or of a pre-\ndeceased daughter, as such child would have got had he or she been alive\nat the time of the partition, shall be allotted to the child of such pre-\ndeceased child of the pre-deceased son or a pre-deceased daughter, as the\ncase may be.\n\nExplanation. — For the purposes of this sub- section, the interest of a Hindu\nMitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to be the share in the property that\nwould have been allotted to him if a partition of the property had taken\nplace immediately before his death, irrespective of whether he was entitled\nto claim partition or not.\n\n\f 26\n\n (4) After the commencement of the \nHindu Succession (Amendment) Act,\n 2005\n, no court shall recognise any right to proceed against a son, grandson\n or great- grandson for the recovery of any debt due from his father,\n grandfather or great-grandfather solely on the ground of the pious\n obligation under the Hindu law, of such son, grandson or great-grandson\n to discharge any such debt:\n\n Provided that in the case of any debt contracted before the commencement\n of the \nHindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005\n, nothing contained in this\n sub- section shall affect—\n\n (a) the right of any creditor to proceed against the son, grandson or great-\n\n grandson, as the case may be; or\n\n (b) any alienation made in respect of or in satisfaction of, any such debt,\n and any such right or alienation shall be enforceable under the rule of pious\n obligation in the same manner and to the same extent as it would have been\n enforceable as if the \nHindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005\n had not\n been enacted.\n\n Explanation.—For the purposes of clause (a), the expression \"son\",\n \"grandson\" or \"great- grandson\" shall be deemed to refer to the son,\n grandson or great-grandson, as the case may be, who was born or adopted\n prior to the commencement of the \nHindu Succession (Amendment) Act,\n 2005\n.\n\n (5) Nothing contained in this section shall apply to a partition, which has\n been effected before the 20th day of December, 2004.\"\n\n Explanation.- For the purposes of this section \"partition\" means any\n partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under\n the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n (16 of 1908) or partition effected by a decree of\n a court.”\n\n59. Before we proceed to discuss the dictum, as laid by this Court in \nVineeta\nSharma\n (supra) we must look into the decision of this Court in the case of \nGanduri\nKoteshwaramma\n (supra).\n \nIn \nGanduri Koteshwaramma\n (supra) this Court, in paras\n11, 12, 13 & 14 resply, observed as under:\n\n “11. The new \nSection 6\n provides for parity of rights in the coparcenary\n property among male and female members of a joint Hindu family on and\n from 9-9-2005. The legislature has now conferred substantive right in\n favour of the daughters. According to the new \nSection 6\n, the daughter of a\n\n\f 27\n\ncoparcener becomes a coparcener by birth in her own rights and liabilities\nin the same manner as the son. The declaration in \nSection 6\n that the\ndaughter of the coparcener shall have same rights and liabilities in the\ncoparcenary property as she would have been a son is unambiguous and\nunequivocal. Thus, on and from 9-9-2005, the daughter is entitled to a share\nin the ancestral property and is a coparcener as if she had been a son.\n\n12. The right accrued to a daughter in the property of a joint Hindu family\ngoverned by the Mitakshara law, by virtue of the 2005 Amendment Act, is\nabsolute, except in the circumstances provided in the proviso appended to\nsub-section (1) of \nSection 6\n. The excepted categories to which new \nSection\n6\n of the 1956 Act is not applicable are two, namely, (i) where the disposition\nor alienation including any partition has taken place before 20-12-2004;\n\nand (ii) where testamentary disposition of property has been made before\n20-12-2004. Sub-section (5) of \nSection 6\n leaves no room for doubt as it\nprovides that this section shall not apply to the partition which has been\neffected before 20-12-2004. For the purposes of new \nSection 6\n it is\nexplained that “partition” means any partition made by execution of a deed\nof partition duly registered under the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n or partition\neffected by a decree of a court. In light of a clear provision contained in the\nExplanation appended to sub-section (5) of \nSection 6\n, for determining the\nnon-applicability of the section, what is relevant is to find out whether the\npartition has been effected before 20-12-2004 by deed of partition duly\nregistered under the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n or by a decree of a court. In the\nbackdrop of the above legal position with reference to \nSection 6\n brought in\nthe 1956 Act by the 2005 Amendment Act, the question that we have to\nanswer is as to whether the preliminary decree passed by the trial court on\n19-3-1999 and amended on 27-9-2003 deprives the appellants of the\nbenefits of the 2005 Amendment Act although final decree for partition has\nnot yet been passed.\n\n13. The legal position is settled that partition of a joint Hindu family can be\neffected by various modes, inter alia, two of these modes are (one) by a\nregistered instrument of a partition and (two) by a decree of the court. In\nthe present case, admittedly, the partition has not been effected before 20-\n12-2004 either by a registered instrument of partition or by a decree of the\ncourt. The only stage that has reached in the suit for partition filed by\nRespondent 1 is the determination of shares vide preliminary decree dated\n19-3-1999 which came to be amended on 27-9-2003 and the receipt of the\nreport of the Commissioner.\n\n14. A preliminary decree determines the rights and interests of the parties.\nThe suit for partition is not disposed of by passing of the preliminary decree.\nIt is by a final decree that the immovable property of joint Hindu family is\npartitioned by metes and bounds. After the passing of the preliminary\n\n\f 28\n\n decree, the suit continues until the final decree is passed. If in the\n interregnum i.e. after passing of the preliminary decree and before the final\n decree is passed, the events and supervening circumstances occur\n necessitating change in shares, there is no impediment for the court to\n amend the preliminary decree or pass another preliminary decree\n redetermining the rights and interests of the parties having regard to the\n changed situation.”\n\n60. Thus, in \nGanduri Koteshwaramma\n (supra) this Court made the following\nthings explicitly clear:\n\n (i) The equal share given to the daughter of a coparcener governed by Hindu\n Mitakshara Law along with brothers is by way of a substantive right;\n\n (ii) Though the substantive right is created on and from 9-9-2005, it relates\n back to the incidence of birth;\n\n (iii) The substantive right would not be available only if the coparcenary\n property is disposed of or alienated including by any partition or\n testamentary disposition of property before 20-12-2004 and;\n\n (iv) If there is disposition of a coparcenary property by any partition, such\n partition must be by execution of a Deed of Partition duly registered under\n the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n or effected by a decree of the Court.\n\n (v) A preliminary decree of partition only determines the rights and\n interests of the parties. It is only by a final decree that the immovable\n property of joint Hindu family is partitioned by metes and bounds. After the\n passing of the preliminary decree, the suit continues until the final decree is\n passed. If in the interregnum i.e. after passing of the preliminary decree and\n before the final decree is passed, if there is any change in law necessitating\n determination of shares accordingly then, there would be no impediment for\n the Court to amend the preliminary decree or pass another preliminary decree\n redetermining the rights and interests of the parties having regard to the\n changed situation.\n\n\f 29\n\n61. Before the position of law came to be settled by this Court in \nVineeta Sharma\n\n(supra) there were to decisions of this Court governing the rights of the parties: (i)\nPrakash and Others v. Phulavati and Others reported in (2016) 2 SCC 36 and (ii)\nDanamma alias \nSuman Surpur and Another v. Amar and Others\n reported in (2018)\n3 SCC 343.\n In Prakash (supra) it was held that \nSection 6\n is not retrospective in\noperation and it would apply when both the coparcener and his daughter were alive on\nthe date of commencement of the Amendment Act i.e., 9.09.2005. Accordingly, the\nprovisions of \nSection 6\n were held to be prospective. In Danamma (supra) this Court\nheld that the amended provisions of \nSection 6\n conferred full rights upon the daughter\ncoparcener. Any coparcener including a daughter could claim a partition in the\ncoparcenary property.\n\n62. In Danamma (supra), one Gurulingappa who was the father and coparcener of\nthe claimant daughter, died in the year 2001, leaving behind two daughters, two sons\nand a widow. Thus, the father of the daughter and coparceners was not alive when the\nsubstituted provision of \nSection 6\n came into force. Accordingly, the daughters, sons\nand the widow were given 1/5th share in the properties. In this background, this Court\ntook the view that when a daughter, claiming and demanding a share in the coparcenary\nproperty is alive on 9.09.2005, she would be entitled to the benefit of the amended\nprovision irrespective of the effect whether a coparcener had died before the\ncommencement of the Amendment Act.\n\n63. A three-Judge Bench of this Court doubted the correctness of the dictum as laid in\nPrakash (supra) as there was an apparent conflict between the dictum as laid in\nPrakash (supra) and Danamma (supra) referred to above. The question concerning the\ninterpretation of \nSection 6\n of the Act 1956 was referred to a larger Bench.\n\n64. The larger Bench ultimately settled the position of law in \nVineeta Sharma\n\n(supra). The three-Judge Bench of this Court considered the following main questions\namongst the others:\n\n (i) Whether the substituted \nSection 6\n of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 would\n\n\f 30\n\n apply to cases where male coparcener had already died prior to the\n commencement of the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n?\n\n (ii) Liability of daughter for the debts contracted by the deceased coparcener.\n\n (iii) What is the interpretation, scope and impact of sub-section (5) of\n substituted \nSection 6\n of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956?\n\n65. \nIn \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra) (paras 60, 68, 69 and 129), the Court held that for\nthe applicability of substituted \nSection 6\n of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, it is not\nnecessary that the male coparcener must be alive on the date of commencement of the\n\nAmendment Act, 2005\n (i.e., 9.9.2005). Hence, it follows that the substituted \nSection 6\n\nof the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 is not confined to cases where male coparcener dies\nafter the commencement of the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n. Substituted \nSection 6\n also\napplies to cases where male coparcener had already died prior to the commencement\nof the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n.\n\n66. The Court explained the difference between prospective statute, retrospective\nstatute and retroactive statute. It has been observed in para 61:\n\n “61. The prospective statute operates from the date of its enactment\n conferring new rights. The retrospective statute operates backward and\n takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws. A\n retroactive statute is the one that does not operate retrospectively. It\n operates in futuro. However, its operation is based upon the character or\n status that arose earlier. Characteristic or event which happened in the\n past or requisites which had been drawn from antecedent events. Under\n the amended \nSection 6\n, since the right is given by birth, that is, an\n antecedent event, and the provisions operate concerning claiming rights\n on and from the date of Amendment Act.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n67. Interpreting sub-section (1) of substituted \nSection 6\n of the Act 1956, the Court\nopined in para 60 as under:\n\n “60. The amended provisions of \nSection 6(1)\n provide that on and from the\n commencement of the Amendment Act, the daughter is conferred the right.\n \nSection 6(1)(a)\n makes daughter by birth a coparcener “in her own right”\n and “in the same manner as the son”. \nSection 6(1)(a)\n contains the concept\n\n\f 31\n\n of the unobstructed heritage of Mitakshara coparcenary, which is by\n virtue of birth. \nSection 6(1)(b)\n confers the same rights in the coparcenary\n property “as she would have had if she had been a son”. The conferral of\n right is by birth, and the rights are given in the same manner with incidents\n of coparcenary as that of a son and she is treated as a coparcener in the\n same manner with the same rights as if she had been a son at the time of\n birth. Though the rights can be claimed, w.e.f. 9-9-2005, the provisions\n are of retroactive application; they confer benefits based on the\n antecedent event, and the Mitakshara coparcenary law shall be deemed to\n include a reference to a daughter as a coparcener. At the same time, the\n legislature has provided savings by adding a proviso that any disposition\n or alienation, if there be any testamentary disposition of the property or\n partition which has taken place before 20-12-2004, the date on which the\n Bill was presented in the Rajya Sabha, shall not be invalidated.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n68. The Court further observed in para 68 as follows:\n\n “68. Considering the principle of coparcenary that a person is conferred\n the rights in the Mitakshara coparcenary by birth, similarly, the daughter\n has been recognised and treated as a coparcener, with equal rights and\n liabilities as of that of a son. The expression used in \nSection 6\n is that she\n becomes coparcener in the same manner as a son. By adoption also, the\n status of coparcener can be conferred. The concept of uncodified Hindu\n law of unobstructed heritage has been given a concrete shape under the\n provisions of \nSections 6(1)(a)\n and \n6(1) (b)\n. Coparcener right is by birth.\n Thus, it is not at all necessary that the father of the daughter should be\n living as on the date of the amendment, as she has not been conferred the\n rights of a coparcener by obstructed heritage. According to the\n Mitakshara coparcenary Hindu law, as administered which is recognised\n in \nSection 6(1)\n, it is not necessary that there should be a living, coparcener\n or father as on the date of the amendment to whom the daughter would\n succeed. The daughter would step into the coparcenary as that of a son by\n taking birth before or after the Act. However, daughter born before can\n claim these rights only with effect from the date of the amendment, i.e., 9-\n 9-2005 with saving of past transactions as provided in the proviso to\n \nSection 6(1)\n read with \nSection 6(5)\n.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n69. The Court has further observed in para 69 as under:\n\n “69. … \nSection 6(1)\n recognises a joint Hindu family governed by\n Mitakshara law. The coparcenary must exist on 9-9-2005 to enable the\n daughter of a coparcener to enjoy rights conferred on her. As the right is\n by birth and not by dint of inheritance, it is irrelevant that a coparcener\n\n\f 32\n\n whose daughter is conferred with the rights is alive or not. Conferral is\n not based on the death of a father or other coparcener. In case living\n coparcener dies after 9-9-2005, inheritance is not by survivorship but by\n intestate or testamentary succession as provided in substituted \nSection\n 6(3)\n.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n70. Explaining sub-section (3) of substituted \nSection 6\n, the Court observed in\nparagraph 66 as under:\n\n “66. With respect to a Hindu who dies after the commencement of the\n Amendment Act, as provided in \nsection 6(3)\n his interest shall pass by\n testamentary or intestate succession and not by survivorship, and there is\n a deemed partition of the coparcenary property in order to ascertain the\n shares which would have been allotted to his heirs had there been a\n partition. The daughter is to be allotted the same share as a son; even\n surviving child of predeceased daughter or son are given a share in case\n the child has also died then the surviving child of such predeceased child\n of a predeceased son or predeceased daughter would be allotted the same\n share, had they been alive at the time of deemed partition. Thus, there is\n a sea-change in substituted \nSection 6\n. In case of death of coparcener after\n 9-9-2005, succession is not by survivorship but in accordance with \nSection\n 6(3)\n. The Explanation to \nSection 6(3)\n is the same as Explanation I to\n \nSection 6\n as originally enacted. …” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n71. The following propositions, amongst others, follow from the abovequoted\nparagraphs of the decision in \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra):\n\n (A) Sub-section (1) of the substituted \nSection 6\n of the Hindu Succession Act,\n 1956 recognises a joint Hindu family governed by Mitakshara law.\n\n (B) The coparcenary must exist on 9.9.2005, i.e., the date of commencement of\n the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n.\n\n (C) The daughter has been recognised and treated as a coparcener by birth, with\n equal rights and liabilities as of that of a son.\n\n (D) It is not necessary that a coparcener whose daughter is conferred with the\n rights is alive or not on the date of commencement of the \nAmendment Act,\n 2005\n. The daughter would step into the coparcenary as that of a son by birth.\n\n\f 33\n\n (E) Though the daughter would step into the coparcenary as that of a son by\n birth whether the daughter is born before the commencement of the\n \nAmendment Act, 2005\n or after the commencement of the \nAmendment Act,\n 2005\n, but the daughter born before the commencement of the \nAmendment Act,\n 2005\n can claim coparcenary rights only with effect from the date of the\n amendment, i.e., 9.9.2005 with saving of past transactions as provided in the\n proviso to \nSection 6(1)\n read with \nSection 6(5)\n.\n\n (F) In case a coparcener living on the date of commencement of the\n \nAmendment Act, 2005\n (i.e., 9.9.2005) dies after 9.9.2005, inheritance is not by\n survivorship but by intestate or testamentary succession as provided in\n substituted \nSection 6(3)\n.\n\n72. As noted earlier, sub-section (5) of substituted \nSection 6\n of the Hindu Succession\nAct, 1956 provides that nothing contained in the substituted \nSection 6\n shall apply to a\npartition, which has been effected before 20th December, 2004 (i.e., date on which the\nBill corresponding to the \nAmendment Act, 2005\n was presented in the Rajya Sabha).\nExplanation to the substituted \nSection 6\n provides that for the purposes of \nSection 6\n\n“partition” means (i) any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly\nregistered under the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n (16 of 1908), or (ii) any partition effected\nby a decree of a court. \nInterpreting sub-section (5) of substituted \nSection 6\n and\nExplanation to substituted \nSection 6\n, the Court in \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra), has\nobserved in para 67 as under:\n\n “67. The proviso to \nSection 6(1)\n and \nSection 6(5)\n saves any partition\n effected before 20-12-2004. However, Explanation to \nSection 6(5)\n\n recognises partition effected by execution of a deed of partition duly\n registered under the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n or by a decree of a court.\n Other forms of partition have not been recognised under the definition of\n “partition” in the Explanation.”\n\n73. In regard to the sub-section (5) of substituted \nSection 6\n and Explanation to\nsubstituted \nSection 6\n, the Court held:\n\n\f 34\n\n(A) It has been held that the daughter has now become entitled to claim partition\nof coparcenary with effect from 9.09.2005 like a son.\n\n The Court observed in para 85 as under:\n\n “85. The right to claim partition is a significant basic feature of the\n coparcenary, and a coparcener is one who can claim partition. The\n daughter has now become entitled to claim partition of coparcenary w.e.f.\n 9-9-2005, which is a vital change brought about by the statute. A\n coparcener enjoys the right to seek severance of status. Under \nSections\n 6(1)\n and \n6(2)\n, the rights of a daughter are pari passu with a son. In the\n eventuality of a partition, apart from sons and daughters, the wife of the\n coparcener is also entitled to an equal share. The right of the wife of a\n coparcener to claim her right in property is in no way taken away.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n(B) As noted earlier, under the law pertaining to partition as existing prior to the\n\nAmendment Act, 2005\n, if there would be a partition of coparcenary property\nbetween father (F) and sons (S1 and S2) then the wife (W) of father (F) as well as\nwidowed mother (M) of father (F) would get one share equal share to that of a son\n(S1 or S2). This position continues to exist as is evident from the observation made\nin the last portion of the above-quoted paragraph 85 of this Court’s decision.\n\nHence, if there is a partition of coparcenary property between father and sons (and\nnow also daughters), then wife of father as well as widowed mother of father\nwould get one share equal share to that of a son (or a daughter).\n\n(C) Under Mitakshara School of Hindu Law, a member of a joint Hindu Family\ncan bring about his separation in status by a definite, unequivocal and unilateral\ndeclaration of his intention to separate himself from the family and enjoy his share\nin severalty. Thus, the institution of a suit for partition by a member of a joint\nfamily is a clear intimation of his intention to separate, and there was\nconsequential severance of the status of jointness. Question before this Court in\n\nVineeta Sharma\n (supra) was: in case during the pendency of partition suit or\nduring the period between the passing of preliminary decree and final decree in\nthe partition suit, any legislative amendment or any subsequent event takes place\n\n\f 35\n\n which results in enlargement or diminution of the shares of the parties or alteration\n of their rights, whether such legislative amendment or subsequent event can be\n into consideration and given effect to while passing final decree in the partition\n suit. The Court held that even though filing of partition suit brings about severance\n of status of jointness, such legislative amendment or subsequent event will have\n to be taken into consideration and given effect to in passing the final decree in the\n partition suit. This is because, the partition suit can be regarded as fully and\n completely decided only when the final decree is passed. It is by a final decree\n that partition of property of joint Hindu Family takes place by metes and bounds.\n (See: paragraphs 89 to 102, and paragraphs 106, 114, 133 and 136).\n\n The Court observed in para 107 as under:\n\n “107. Once the constitution of coparcenary changes by birth or\n death, shares have to be worked out at the time of actual partition. The\n shares will have to be determined in changed scenario. The severance of\n status cannot come in the way to give effect to statutory provision and\n change by subsequent event. The statutory fiction of partition is far short\n of actual partition, it does not bring about the disruption of the joint family\n or that of coparcenary is a settled proposition of law. For the reasons\n mentioned above, we are also of the opinion that mere severance of status\n by way of filing a suit does not bring about the partition and till the date\n of the final decree, change in law, and changes due to the subsequent event\n can be taken into consideration.” (Emphasis supplied)\n (D) Prior to the Amendment Act, 2005, partition in joint Hindu Family could be\n made by oral partition or oral family settlement/family arrangement. If\n subsequently terms of such oral partition or oral family settlement/family\n arrangement could be recorded in a Memorandum. Such Memorandum was not\n required to be registered. [See: paragraphs 115, 116, 119, 120, 121, 125 and 130\n ].\n\n74. As noted above, Explanation to substituted \nSection 6\n provides that for the\npurposes of \nSection 6\n “partition” means (i) any partition made by execution of a deed\nof partition duly registered under the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n (16 of 1908), or (ii) any\npartition effected by a decree of a court. The Court in further considered the impact of\n\n\f 36\n\nthe aforesaid Explanation on the oral partition or oral family settlement/family\narrangement made prior to 20th December, 2004. The Court opined in para 124 as\nunder:\n\n “124. The intendment of amended \nSection 6\n is to ensure that\n daughters are not deprived of their rights of obtaining share on becoming\n coparcener and claiming a partition of the coparcenary property by\n setting up the frivolous defence of oral partition and/or recorded in the\n unregistered memorandum of partition. The court has to keep in mind the\n possibility that a plea of oral partition may be set up, fraudulently or in\n collusion, or based on unregistered memorandum of partition which may\n also be created at any point of time. Such a partition is not recognised\n under \nSection 6(5)\n.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n75. The \nCourt further held\n para 135 as under:\n\n “135. A special definition of partition has been carved out in the\n Explanation. The intendment of the provisions is not to jeopardise the\n interest of the daughter and to take care of sham or frivolous transaction\n set up in defence unjustly to deprive the daughter of her right as\n coparcener and prevent nullifying the benefit flowing from the provisions\n as substituted. The statutory provisions made in \nSection 6(5)\n change the\n entire complexion as to partition. However, under the law that prevailed\n earlier, an oral partition was recognised. In view of change of provisions\n of \nSection 6\n, the intendment of legislature is clear and such a plea of oral\n partition is not to be readily accepted. The provisions of \nSection 6(5)\n are\n required to be interpreted to cast a heavy burden of proof upon proponent\n of oral partition before it is accepted such as separate occupation of\n portions, appropriation of the income, and consequent entry in the\n revenue records and invariably to be supported by other\n contemporaneous public documents admissible in evidence, may be\n accepted most reluctantly while exercising all safeguards. The intendment\n of \nSection 6\n of the Act is only to accept the genuine partitions that might\n have taken place under the prevailing law, and are not set up as a false\n defence and only oral ipse dixit is to be rejected outrightly. The object of\n preventing, setting up of false or frivolous defence to set at naught the\n benefit emanating from amended provisions, has to be given full effect.\n Otherwise, it would become very easy to deprive the daughter of her rights\n as a coparcener. When such a defence is taken, the court has to be very\n extremely careful in accepting the same, and only if very cogent,\n impeccable, and contemporaneous documentary evidence in shape of\n public documents in support are available, such a plea may be\n\n\f 37\n\n entertained, not otherwise. We reiterate that the plea of an oral partition\n or memorandum of partition, unregistered one can be manufactured at\n any point in time, without any contemporaneous public document needs\n rejection at all costs. We say so for exceptionally good cases where\n partition is proved conclusively and we caution the courts that the finding\n is not to be based on the preponderance of probabilities in view of\n provisions of gender justice and the rigour of very heavy burden of proof\n which meet intendment of Explanation to \nSection 6(5)\n. It has to be\n remembered that the courts cannot defeat the object of the beneficial\n provisions made by the Amendment Act. The exception is carved out by us\n as earlier execution of a registered document for partition was not\n necessary, and the court was rarely approached for the sake of family\n prestige. It was approached as a last resort when parties were not able to\n settle their family dispute amicably. We take note of the fact that even\n before 1956, partition in other modes than envisaged under \nSection 6(5)\n\n had taken place.” (Emphasis supplied). (Reference: Article titled\n ‘Changing Dimensions of Hindu Coparcenary and \nSection 6\n, Hindu\n Succession Act, 1956 by Justice Satya Poot Mehrotra, Former Judge\n Allahabad High Court.)\n\n76. The reference was ultimately answered in paras 137.1 to 137.5 resply as under:\n\n “137.1. The provisions contained in substituted \nSection 6\n of the Hindu\n Succession Act, 1956 confer status of coparcener on the daughter born\n before or after the amendment in the same manner as son with same rights\n and liabilities.\n\n 137.2. The rights can be claimed by the daughter born earlier with effect\n from 9-9-2005 with savings as provided in \nSection 6(1)\n as to the\n disposition or alienation, partition or testamentary disposition which had\n taken place before the 20th day of December, 2004.\n\n 137.3. Since the right in coparcenary is by birth, it is not necessary that\n father coparcener should be living as on 9-9-2005.\n\n 137.4. The statutory fiction of partition created by the proviso to \nSection\n 6\n of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as originally enacted did not bring\n about the actual partition or disruption of coparcenary. The fiction was\n only for the purpose of ascertaining share of deceased coparcener when\n he was survived by a female heir, of Class I as specified in the Schedule\n to the 1956 Act or male relative of such female. The provisions of the\n substituted \nSection 6\n are required to be given full effect. Notwithstanding\n that a preliminary decree has been passed, the daughters are to be given\n share in coparcenary equal to that of a son in pending proceedings for\n final decree or in an appeal.\n\n\f 38\n\n 137.5. In view of the rigour of provisions of the Explanation to \nSection\n 6(5)\n of the 1956 Act, a plea of oral partition cannot be accepted as the\n statutory recognised mode of partition effected by a deed of partition duly\n registered under the provisions of the \nRegistration Act, 1908\n or effected\n by a decree of a court. However, in exceptional cases where plea of oral\n partition is supported by public documents and partition is finally evinced\n in the same manner as if it had been affected (sic effected) by a decree of\n a court, it may be accepted. A plea of partition based on oral evidence\n alone cannot be accepted and to be rejected outrightly.”\n\n77. The decision of \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra) also highlights that a change in law\nduring the pendency of an appeal must be considered and appropriately applied.\n \nThis\nCourt relied upon \nUnited Bank of India, Calcutta v. Abhijit Tea Company Private\nLimited and Others\n reported in (2000) 7 SCC 357, wherein, it was held that:\n\n “20. Now, it is well settled that it is the duty of a court, whether it is trying\n original proceedings or hearing an appeal, to take notice of the change in\n law affecting pending actions and to give effect to the same. (See G.P.\n Singh: Interpretation of Statutes, 7th Edn., p. 406.) If, while a suit is\n pending, a law like the 1993 Act that the civil court shall not decide the\n suit, is passed, the civil court is bound to take judicial notice of the statute\n and hold that the suit — even after its remand — cannot be disposed of by\n it.”\n\n78. This Court in \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra) clarified the entire position as follows:\n\n “107. Once the constitution of coparcenary changes by birth or death,\n shares have to be worked out at the time of actual partition. The shares\n will have to be determined in changed scenario. The severance of status\n cannot come in the way to give effect to statutory provision and change\n by subsequent event. The statutory fiction of partition is far short of actual\n partition, it does not bring about the disruption of the joint family or that\n of coparcenary is a settled proposition of law. For the reasons mentioned\n above, we are also of the opinion that mere severance of status by way of\n filing a suit does not bring about the partition and till the date of the final\n decree, change in law, and changes due to the subsequent event can be\n taken into consideration.\n\n Xxx xxx xxx\n\n \n114. In the instant case, the question is different. What has been\n recognised as partition by the legislation under \nSection 6\n, accordingly,\n rights are to be worked out. This Court consistently held in various\n decisions mentioned above that when the rights are subsequently\n\n\f 39\n\n conferred, the preliminary decree can be amended, and the benefit of law\n has to be conferred. Hence, we have no hesitation to reject the effect of\n statutory fiction of the proviso to \nSection 6\n as discussed\n in \nPrakash v. Phulavati\n [(2016) 2 SCC 36 : (\n2016) 1 SCC (Civ) 549]\n and Danamma [Danamma v. Amar\n, (2018) 3 SCC 343 : (2018) 2 SCC\n (Civ) 385]. If a daughter is alive on the date of enforcement of the\n Amendment Act, she becomes a coparcener with effect from the date of\n the Amendment Act, irrespective of the date of birth earlier in point of\n time.”\nAPPLICATION OF THE AFORESAID PRINCIPLES OF LAW TO THE\nFACTS OF THE PRESENT CASE\n\n79. Let us assume for the moment that the Trial Court would have decreed the suit\nin favour of the plaintiff i.e., the daughter giving her 1/3rd share uniformly in all the\nproperties including the ancestral properties. It could have been argued that the Trial\nCourt could not have done so, having regard to the position of law, prevailing at the\nrelevant point of time. However, after the decision of this Court in the case of \nVineeta\nSharma\n (supra) such allotment of share would be in accordance with law. Let us also\nassume one another alternative. Take for instance, the Trial Court would have decreed\nthe suit giving (i) 1/3rd share to the daughter in self-acquired property and (ii) giving\n1/3rd share in the half were of father's portion of ancestral properties. This was the law\nprevailing at the relevant point of time and this is exactly what the Trial Court has done\nin the present case, while passing the preliminary decree as affirmed by the High Court.\nHowever, the law has now changed as discussed above.\n\n80. It is in the aforesaid background that daughters are entitled to 1/3rd share in all\nthe properties as scheduled in the plaint. The same would be in accordance with the\ndictum as laid in \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra), while passing the final decree. At the cost\nof repetition, we state that by virtue of the preliminary decree passed by the Trial Court,\nwhich was confirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court, the issues decided\ntherein will be deemed to have become final but as the partition suit is required to be\ndecided in stages, the same can be regarded as fully and completely decided only when\nthe final decree is passed. As the law governing the parties has been amended before\nthe conclusion of the final decree proceedings, the party benefitted by such amendment\n\n\f 40\n\n(like the two daughters in the case on hand) can make a request to the Trial Court to\ntake cognizance of the Amendment and give effect to the same.\n\n81. We do not find any merit in the submissions canvassed by Mr. Basant, learned\nSenior Counsel appearing for the Appellants that in a partition suit, the preliminary\ndecree cannot be varied in the final decree proceedings, despite the amendment of the\nlaw governing the parties.\n\n82. In our opinion, no error not to speak of any error of law could be said to have\nbeen committed upon Courts below, while determining the shares of the parties. The\nonly thing that needs to be done now is to give effect to the amendment in the provisions\nof \nSection 6\n of the 1956 Act and redetermine the shares of the parties accordingly. To\nput it straight, the Plaintiff is entitled to 1/3 rd share in all the properties of her Late\nfather. The issue whether all the properties were ancestral as raised on behalf of the\nAppellants pale into insignificance.\n\nISSUE NO. 2\n\n83. We shall now proceed to answer the issue No. 2 whether the High Court was\njustified in allowing the cross-appeal filed by the Original Defendant No. 2 on the\nground that the settlement arrived at between the Appellants (Defendant No 1 and\nDefendant No. 2) was not valid and binding under \nOrder XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC\n.\n\n84. Mr. Basant, learned Senior Counsel vehemently submitted that the settlement\nbetween the Defendant No. 1 and his sister i.e., the Defendant No. 2 was duly signed\non affidavit way back on 29.03.1991. The said settlement was taken on record by the\nHigh Court on 9.04.1991 i.e., at the time of the final hearing of the first appeal. The\nfirst appeal came to be disposed of on 1.08.2000, modifying the decree to the extent of\nincorporating the terms of the compromise agreement between the two Defendants. It\nis only after a lapse of ten years that during the pendency of the appeal filed by the\nAppellants herein before the Division Bench of the High Court that the Defendant No.\n2 thought fit to file cross-appeal, challenging the alleged compromise. Mr. Basant\nsubmitted that such cross-appeal is not maintainable and even if it held to be\n\n\f 41\n\nmaintainable, the same should not have been entertained and allowed after the lapse of\nalmost ten years from the date of recording of the settlement.\n\n85. We are not much impressed by the aforesaid submissions of Mr. Basant. It is a\nsettled position of law that right of appeal is the creature of statute. There is no inherent\nright of appeal. No appeal can be filed, heard or determined on merits unless the statute\nconfers right on the appellant and power on the Court to do so. At this stage, we may\nlook into the provisions of \nOrder XLI Rule 22 of the CPC\n:\n\n “22. Upon hearing respondent may object to decree as if he had\n preferred a separate appeal.—(1) Any respondent, though he may not\n have appealed from any part of the decree, may not only support the\n decree [but may also state that the finding against him in the Court below\n in respect of any issue ought to have been in his favour; and may also take\n any cross-objection] to the decree which he could have taken by way of\n appeal provided he has filed such objection in the Appellate Court within\n one month from the date of service on him or his pleader of notice of the\n day fixed for hearing the appeal, or within such further time as the\n Appellate Court may see fit to allow.\n\n [Explanation.—A respondent aggrieved by a finding of the Court in the\n judgment on which the decree appealed against is based may, under this\n rule, file cross-objection in respect of the decree in so far as it is based on\n that finding, notwithstanding that by reason of the decision of the Court\n on any other finding which is sufficient for the decision of the suit, the\n decree, is, wholly or in part, in favour of that respondent.]\n (2) Form of objection and provisions applicable thereto.—Such cross-\n\n objection shall be in the form of a memorandum, and the provisions of\n rule 1, so far as they relate to the form and contents of the memorandum\n of appeal, shall apply thereto.\n\n [3***]\n (4) Where, in any case in which any respondent has under this rule filed\n a memorandum of objection, the original appeal is withdrawn or is\n dismissed for default, the objection so filed may nevertheless be heard and\n determined after such notice to the other parties as the Court thinks fit.\n\n (5) The provisions relating to appeals by indigent persons shall, so far as\n they can be made applicable, apply to an objection under this rule.”\n\n86. The right to prefer cross-objection partakes of the right to prefer an appeal. The\n\n\f 42\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the Defendant No. 2 (Respondent No. 2 herein) that a\ncross-appeal under \nOrder XLI Rule 22 of the CPC\n is as effective as a regular first appeal\nand the same would sustain, even if, the regular first appeal is dismissed or withdrawn.\nA cross-appeal is the exercise of substantive right of appeal and only the procedure\nvaries. (See: \nUrmila Devi and Others v. Branch Manager, National Insurance\nCompany Limited and Another\n, (2020)11 SCC 316, para 16.)\n\n87. Our attention was also drawn to the provisions of Order XLIII of Rule 1-A (2)\n\nof the CPC\n. The same reads as under:\n\n “1A. Right to challenge non-appealable orders in appeal against\n decrees.—\n Xxx xxx xxx\n (2) In an appeal against a decree passed in a suit after recording a\n compromise or refusing to record a compromise, it shall be open to the\n appellant to contest the decree on the ground that the compromise should,\n or should not, have been recorded.”\n\n88. We are of the view that the cross-appeal objector is entitled under \nOrder XLI\nRule 22 of the CPC\n read with Order XLIII Rule 1-A (2) \nof the CPC\n as \nreferred to above\n,\nto make good the submission that she was entitled in law to question the legality and\nvalidity of the settlement agreement recorded under \nOrder XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC\n by\nway of a cross-appeal.\n\n89. \nIn the aforesaid context, we may refer to the decision of this Court in the case of\n\nBanwari Lal v. Chando Devi (Smt) and Another\n reported in (1993) 1 SCC 581, more\nparticularly, paras 9 to 13 resply therein:\n\n “9. Section 96(3) of the Code says that no appeal shall lie from a decree\n passed by the Court with the consent of the parties. Rule 1-A(2) has been\n introduced saying that against a decree passed in a suit after recording a\n compromise, it shall be open to the appellant to contest the decree on the\n ground that the compromise should not have been recorded. When Section\n 96(3) bars an appeal against decree passed with the consent of parties, it\n implies that such decree is valid and binding on the parties unless set\n aside by the procedure prescribed or available to the parties. One such\n remedy available was by filing the appeal under Order 43, Rule 1(m). If\n\n\f 43\n\nthe order recording the compromise was set aside, there was no necessity\nor occasion to file an appeal against the decree. Similarly a suit used to\nbe filed for setting aside such decree on the ground that the decree is\nbased on an invalid and illegal compromise not binding on the plaintiff of\nthe second suit. But after the amendments which have been introduced,\nneither an appeal against the order recording the compromise nor remedy\nby way of filing a suit is available in cases covered by Rule 3-A of Order\n\n23. As such a right has been given under Rule 1-A(2) of Order 43 to a\nparty, who challenges the recording of the compromise, to question the\nvalidity thereof while preferring an appeal against the decree. Section\n96(3) of the Code shall not be a bar to such an appeal because Section\n96(3) is applicable to cases where the factum of compromise or agreement\nis not in dispute.\n\n10. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent took a stand that\nthe High Court was justified in taking the view that the suit had been\nsimply withdrawn by the plaintiff-appellant under Rule 1 of Order 23 and\nit had not been compromised in terms of Rule 3 of the said Order 23; as\nsuch there was no occasion for the appellant to file an application for\nrecall of the said order and for restoration of the suit in question for being\nheard on merit. From the copy of the petition which was filed on February\n27, 1991 it appears that the terms and conditions of settlement and\nagreement had been mentioned saying that both parties had entered into\na compromise because of which the plaintiff-appellant had thereafter no\nconnection with the disputed land and defendant-respondent shall be\ndeemed to be in possession and the owner of the said disputed land. The\nprayer made in the said petition also says that the compromise may be\nordered to be accepted. On basis of that petition, as already mentioned\nabove, the court passed an order saying that the compromise had been\naccepted. In the order it has been mentioned that the suit of the plaintiff\nbe “dismissed as per compromise deed Ex. C”. In view of the aforesaid\nfacts and circumstances, it is difficult to hold that by order dated February\n27, 1991 the Court allowed the suit to be withdrawn in terms of Rule 1 of\nOrder 23. The order on face of it purported to dismiss the suit of the\nplaintiff on basis of the terms and conditions mentioned in the petition of\ncompromise. As such, the validity of that order has to be judged treating\nit to be an order deemed to have been passed in purported exercise of the\npower conferred on the Court by Rule 3 of Order 23 of the Code. The\nlearned Subordinate Judge should not have accepted the said petition of\ncompromise even if he had no knowledge of the fraud alleged to have been\npractised on the appellant by his counsel, because admittedly the petition\nof compromise had not been signed either by the respondent or his\ncounsel. This fact should have been discovered by the Court. \nIn the case\nof \nGurpreet Singh v. Chatur Bhuj Goel\n [(1988) 1 SCC 270 : AIR 1988 SC\n\n\f 44\n\n400] it has been said: (SCC p. 276, para 10)\n\n“Under Rule 3 as it now stands, when a claim in suit has been adjusted\nwholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, the\ncompromise must be in writing and signed by the parties and there must\nbe a completed agreement between them. To constitute an adjustment, the\nagreement or compromise must itself be capable of being embodied in a\ndecree. When the parties enter into a compromise during the hearing of a\nsuit or appeal, there is no reason why the requirement that the\ncompromise should be reduced in writing in the form of an instrument\nsigned by the parties should be dispensed with.\n \nThe court must therefore\ninsist upon the parties to reduce the terms into writing.”\n\nThe requirement of the petition of compromise being signed by the parties\nconcerned has been considered also in the case of \nByram Pestonji\nGariwala v. Union Bank of India\n [(1992) 1 SCC 31 : AIR 1991 SC 2234]\n.\n \nIt appears the attention of learned Judges was not drawn to the aforesaid\ncase of this Court in \nGurpreet Singh v. Chatur Bhuj Goel\n [(1988) 1 SCC\n270 : AIR 1988 SC 400].\n\n11. The present case depicts as to how on February 27, 1991 the court\nrecorded the alleged agreement and compromise in a casual manner. It\nneed not be impressed that Rule 3 of Order 23 does not require just a seal\nof approval from the Court to an alleged agreement or compromise said\nto have been entered into between the parties. The statute requires the\nCourt to be first satisfied that the agreement or compromise which has\nbeen entered into between the parties is lawful, before accepting the same.\n\nCourt is expected to apply its judicial mind while examining the terms of\nthe settlement before the suit is disposed of in terms of the agreement\narrived at between the parties. It need not be pointed out that once such a\npetition of compromise is accepted, it becomes the order of the Court and\nacquires the sanctity of a judicial order.\n\n12. On behalf of the respondent a stand was taken that the learned\nSubordinate Judge by his order dated September 20, 1991 could not have\nrecalled the order dated February 27, 1991 and restored the suit to its\noriginal number. It cannot be disputed that the respondent can support\nthe order of the High Court setting aside order dated September 20, 1991\non any other reason than the reason given by the High Court.\n\n13. When the amending Act introduced a proviso along with an\nexplanation to Rule 3 of Order 23 saying that where it is alleged by one\nparty and denied by the other that an adjustment or satisfaction has been\narrived at, “the Court shall decide the question”, the Court before which\n\n\f 45\n\n a petition of compromise is filed and which has recorded such\n compromise, has to decide the question whether an adjustment or\n satisfaction had been arrived at on basis of any lawful agreement. To\n make the enquiry in respect of validity of the agreement or the\n compromise more comprehensive, the explanation to the proviso says that\n an agreement or compromise “which is void or voidable under the \nIndian\n Contract Act\n …” shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of\n the said Rule. In view of the proviso read with the explanation, a Court\n which had entertained the petition of compromise has to examine whether\n the compromise was void or voidable under the \nIndian Contract Act\n. Even\n Rule 1(m) of Order 43 has been deleted under which an appeal was\n maintainable against an order recording a compromise. As such a party\n challenging a compromise can file a petition under proviso to Rule 3 of\n Order 23, or an appeal under Section 96(1) of the Code, in which he can\n now question the validity of the compromise in view of Rule 1-A of Order\n 43 of the Code.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n90. We may also refer to and rely upon the decision of this Court in the case \nVipan\nAggarwal and Another v. Raman Gandotra and Others\n reported in 2022 SCCOnLine\nSC 1357 more particularly paras 4 and 5 resply therein:\n\n \n“4. This Court in a judgment reported in \n‘Banwari Lal v. Chando Devi\n (Smt.) (Through LRS\n.)’ (1993) 1 SCC 581 held the question as to whether\n an aggrieved person against the compromise decree has a right to file an\n application before the Court which granted the decree or an appeal in\n terms of Order 43 Rule 1A of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (for short,\n ‘\nthe CPC\n’). It was held as under:—\n\n “13. When the amending Act introduced a proviso along with an\n explanation to Rule 3 of Order 23 saying that where it is alleged by\n one party and denied by the other that an adjustment or satisfaction\n has been arrived at, “the Court shall decide the question”, the Court\n before which a petition of compromise is filed and which has\n recorded such compromise, has to decide the question whether an\n adjustment or satisfaction had been arrived at on basis of any lawful\n agreement. To make the enquiry in respect of validity of the\n agreement or the compromise more comprehensive, the explanation\n to the proviso says that an agreement or compromise “which is void\n or voidable under the \nIndian Contract Act\n…” shall not be deemed\n to be lawful within the meaning of the said Rule. In view of the\n proviso read with the explanation, a Court which had entertained\n the petition of compromise has to examine whether the compromise\n was void or voidable under the \nIndian Contract Act\n. Even Rule 1(m)\n\n\f 46\n\n of Order 43 has been deleted under which an appeal was\n maintainable against an order recording a compromise. As such a\n party challenging a compromise can file a petition under proviso to\n Rule 3 of Order 23, or an appeal under Section 96(1) of the Code,\n in which he can now question the validity of the compromise in view\n of Rule 1-A of Order 43 of the Code.”\n\n 5. The appellants had thus the right to avail either the remedy of appeal\n in terms of \nOrder 43 Rule 1A CPC\n or by way of an application before the\n court granting decree. Therefore, the application filed by the appellants\n before the Court which granted the decree cannot be said to be without\n jurisdiction.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n91. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the cross-appeal filed by\nthe Original Defendant No. 2, questioning the legality and validity of the settlement\nwas maintainable in law.\n\n92. We shall now look into the circumstances, as highlighted by the learned Senior\nCounsel appearing for the Defendant No. 2, rendering the settlement agreement dated\n28.03.1991 invalid and not binding under \nOrder XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC\n:\n\n “First, the alleged compromise agreement has admittedly not been signed\n by the plaintiff who concededly has a share in the property as a\n coparcener. A written consent of all parties is necessary.\n Secondly, a coparcenary undivided property in specie (Plot No. 140) has\n been allotted to Defendant 2 by Defendant No. 1 over which the plaintiff\n also has an interest.\n\n Thirdly, there is variance between the agreement and the compromise\n petition producing the agreement.\n\n The Variance noted is as follows-\n\n (a) The compromise petition takes in consideration yet another property\n already purchased by Defendant No. 2 by her own income (Schedule B\n property) which was not a part of compromise agreement.\n\n (b) The sketch map appended to the petition shows plot no. 1086 and 1085\n which for part of plot No. 141 instead of plot no. 140 mentioned in clause\n 3 of compromise agreement, and does not indicate any consensus ad idem,\n therefore, the execution of the compromise agreement becomes\n unenforceable.\n\n\f 47\n\n (c) The species of suit property, which was given/provided to Defendant\n no.2 in clause 3 (page 141) of agreement was changed to will be allotted\n to her in final decree proceeding.\n\n (d) The payment of Rs. 12000 which was to be deposited to court without\n any caveat in agreement (See para 4 @ 141) was made subject to further\n orders of the Court in the petition.\n\n (e) There is no express mentioning about the mesne profits in agreement\n whereas a definite clause was inserted in the compromise petition.\n\n (f) The easement rights to property of Defendant No. 2 were recognised\n in agreement and later in petition was altered to that Defendant No. 2\n along with others have to file and take steps to easement rights for which\n the Defendant 1 shall not object.\n\n (h) The agreement provided that the defendant no. 2 shall sign the\n compromise petition which was later altered to signing and swearing the\n affidavit in compromise petition.\n\n Fourthly, the judgment dated 01.08.2000 of the first appellate court\n accepting the compromise does not make allotment of the property\n allotted in specie to the Defendant No. 2. The first appellate court has\n proceeded on the wrong premise that the Defendant No. 2 has\n surrendered her rights to the Defendant No. 1. The first appellate court\n was further wrong in specifically noting that the compromise agreement\n does not cause any prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff and therefore\n can be given effect.\n\n \nFifthly, the compromise agreement was entered into by beckoning a\n smaller share to the Defendant No. 2, while she has a larger share in view\n of \nVineeta Sharma\n (supra). The consideration for the alleged\n compromise/settlement was therefore inadequate and whole agreement\n has to fall to the ground due to changed and supervening circumstances\n effectuated by change in law.\n\n Lastly, even otherwise, the allotment of a co-ownership property in a\n specie to one coparcener cannot be modified in a preliminary decree.\n Moreover, under Hindu Law, the gift/renunciation/relinquishment or\n alienation by one coparcener of his undivided coparcenary interest to\n another coparcener without consent of other coparceners is void.”\n\n93. It is now well settled that under \nOrder XXIII Rule 3 of the CPC\n as it now stands,\nwhen a claim in suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or\ncompromise, the compromise must be in writing and signed by the parties and there\n\n\f 48\n\nmust be a completed agreement between them. To constitute an adjustment, the\nagreement or compromise must itself be capable of being embodied in a decree. (See:\n\nGurpreet Singh v. Chatur Bhuj Goel\n, (1988) 1 SCC 270.)\n\n94. Indisputably, in the case on hand, the plaintiff has not put her signature on the\ndeed of settlement, which was produced before the High Court in first appeal. The\nPlaintiff has made herself very clear that she never joined in the settlement between her\nbrother i.e., the Defendant No. 1 and her sister i.e., the Defendant No. 2. On this ground\nalone, the settlement could be said to be unlawful, being without any written consent\nof all the parties. In a suit for partition of joint property, a decree by consent amongst\nsome only of the parties cannot be maintained.\n\n95. \nIn \nNityamoni Dasi v. Gokul Chandra Sen\n reported in (1911) 9 Ind Cas 210\n(Cal), the Calcutta High Court observed:\n\n “… The decree of the Subordinate Judge must be set aside and the whole\n case retried, because as this is a suit for partition of joint property, a\n decree by consent amongst some only of the parties cannot possibly be\n maintained…..”\n\n96. In Vir Singh and Others v. Kharak Singh and Others reported in AIR 1925 Lah\n280, all the proprietors had not assented to the compromise, Moti Sagar, J. observed:—\n\n “…the alleged compromise not having been assented to by all the\n proprietors was clearly contrary to law and the Court was, therefore, fully\n justified in refusing to enforce it. …”\n\n97. \nIn \nTaraprasanna Sarkar and Another v. Kalikamohan Sarkar and Others\n\nreported in AIR 1924 Cal 80 Mookerjee and Rankin, JJ., held:—\n\n “…There can be no compromise binding upon, all the parties to a\n partition suit until and unless all the parties have joined in the\n compromise:…”\n\n98. In the aforesaid context, we shall also now look into the findings recorded by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court while allowing the cross-appeal filed by the\n\n\f 49\n\nDefendant No. 2. We quote the relevant observations as under:\n\n “The appeal was filed by defendant no. 1 before this Court. In this Appeal\n challenging the correctness of the decision of the learned Single Judge in\n F.A. No. 359/96 on the basis of the compromise petition dated 28.3.1991,\n which is flied and accepted by him is not signed by defendant no.2 and the\n same is signed by her advocate and not signed by the plaintiff and her\n counsel. Therefore, it is urged that the same is not legal compromise as\n provided under Order 23, Rule 3, \nCPC\n and on behalf of defendant no.2 her\n advocate could not have signed the compromise petition as she has not\n executed special 'vakalatnama' giving the authorization in favour of her\n lawyer to compromise the matter between defendant no.1 and 2 In the First\n Appeal. Therefore, First Appellate Judge should not have received the\n compromise petition and accepted the same. The acceptance of the\n compromise petition by the learned Single Judge should have entered\n between the parties including the plaintiff. \nIn support of the said legal\n contention, reliance is placed by the learned counsel on behalf of defendant\n no.2 on the decisions of the apex Court in \nRamasrey & Puspa Devi\n (supra).\n The compromise petition is in variance to the schedule properties of the suit\n and, therefore, it is voidable. The compromise was neither recorded by the\n first appellate court at the time-of filing compromise petition in writing, nor\n the parties were present in the court nor signed the petition in court.\n Therefore, the alleged compromise cannot be termed as compromise\n between the parties in relation to the subject matter covered therein as the\n same is illegal for the reason that it is opposed to Order 23, Rule 3, \nCPC\n.\n Hence the learned Single Judge could not have accepted the same.\n \nIn support\n of this contention, learned Single Judge had rightly \nplaced reliance upon\n the\n decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court In the case of \nGurpreet Singh v.\n Chatur Bhuj Goel\n, AIR 1988 SC 400; and of this Court in the case of \nSanyasi\n Jena and others v. Mina Jena and others\n, AIR 1984 Orissa 213.\n \nFurther the\n reliance placed by the learned counsel for the defendant no.1 upon the\n judgment of \nPuspa Devi\n (supra) is distinguished by defendant no.2 counsel\n stating that compromise petition is being typed in English. Further the same\n is not signed by defendantno.2. Defendant no.1 with a view to deprive\n allotment of share assigned in favour of defendant no.2 by the trial court in\n respect of the suit schedule properties in the absence of signing the\n compromise petition by defendant no.2 and there is no special 'vakalatnama'\n executed in favour of her lawyer, the said compromise petition is unlawful\n and the same could not have been accepted by the first appellate court In the\n Impugned judgment and modified the trial court judgment. Therefore, the\n cross-objection/appeal filed by defendant no.2 has to be allowed by setting\n aside the compromise recorded by the first appellate court In the Impugned\n judgment by modifying trial court judgment in relation to the share of the\n defendant no.2 allotted in respect of the suit schedule properties. Having set\n\n\f 50\n\n aside the said compromise, as recorded in the impugned judgment of the\n First Appellate Court, the trial court judgment is restored with regard to the\n share assigned by him in favour in of defendant no.2 In respect of suit\n schedule properties. Accordingly the cross-objection of the second\n defendant is allowed by answering the aforesaid point no.(iii) in her favour.”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n99. We are in complete agreement with the aforesaid findings recorded by the High\nCourt in its impugned judgment and order while allowing the cross-appeal.\n\n100. The third question that arises for our consideration in context with the legality\nand validity of the settlement is whether the learned advocate appearing for the cross-\nobjector i.e., Defendant No. 2 could have signed the compromise petition without an\nexpress consent. It is an imperative duty of the Court to ascertain the genuineness and\nlawfulness of the compromise deed. Indisputably, in the case on hand, the First\nAppellate Court had neither recorded the statements of the parties in the Court nor had\nmade any inquiry into the terms of the settlement. It is in such circumstances that the\nHigh Court in its impugned order has observed that the Compromise Petition was\nsigned by the advocate without any express authority or without special vakalatnama\nexecuted in favour of the advocate. In fact, the authority was expressly curtailed in the\ncompromise deed.\n\n101. \nIn the aforesaid context, we may refer to the decision of this Court in the case of\n\nHimalayan Cooperative Group Housing Society v. Balwan Singh and Others\n\nreported in (2015) 7 SCC 373, more particularly, paras 22 to 33, which read thus:\n\n “22. Apart from the above, in our view lawyers are perceived to be their\n client's agents. The law of agency may not strictly apply to the client-\n lawyer's relationship as lawyers or agents, lawyers have certain authority\n and certain duties. Because lawyers are also fiduciaries, their duties will\n sometimes be more demanding than those imposed on other agents. The\n authority-agency status affords the lawyers to act for the client on the\n subject-matter of the retainer. One of the most basic principles of the\n lawyer-client relationship is that lawyers owe fiduciary duties to their\n clients. As part of those duties, lawyers assume all the traditional duties\n\n\f 51\n\nthat agents owe to their principals and, thus, have to respect the client's\nautonomy to make decisions at a minimum, as to the objectives of the\nrepresentation. Thus, according to generally accepted notions of\nprofessional responsibility, lawyers should follow the client's instructions\nrather than substitute their judgment for that of the client. The law is now\nwell settled that a lawyer must be specifically authorised to settle and\ncompromise a claim, that merely on the basis of his employment he has\nno implied or ostensible authority to bind his client to a\ncompromise/settlement. To put it alternatively that a lawyer by virtue of\nretention, has the authority to choose the means for achieving the client's\nlegal goal, while the client has the right to decide on what the goal will\nbe. If the decision in question falls within those that clearly belong to the\nclient, the lawyer's conduct in failing to consult the client or in making the\ndecision for the client, is more likely to constitute ineffective assistance of\ncounsel.\n\n23. The Bar Council of India Rules, 1975 (for short “the BCI Rules”), in\nPart VI Chapter II provide for the “Standards of Professional Conduct\nand Etiquette” to be observed by all the advocates under the \nAdvocates\nAct, 1961\n (for short “the 1961 Act”). In the Preamble to Chapter II, the\nBCI Rules provide as follows:\n\n “An advocate shall, at all times, comport himself in a manner\n befitting his status as an officer of the Court, a privileged member of\n the community, and a gentleman, bearing in mind that what may be\n lawful and moral for a person who is not a member of the Bar, or for\n a member of the Bar in his non-professional capacity may still be\n improper for an advocate. Without prejudice to the generality of the\n foregoing obligation, an advocate shall fearlessly uphold the\n interests of his client and in his conduct conform to the rules\n hereinafter mentioned both in letter and in spirit. The rules\n hereinafter mentioned contain canons of conduct and etiquette\n adopted as general guides; yet the specific mention thereof shall not\n be construed as a denial of the existence of others equally imperative\n though not specifically mentioned.”\n\n24. The Preamble makes it imperative that an advocate has to conduct\nhimself and his duties in an extremely responsible manner. They must bear\nin mind that what may be appropriate and lawful for a person who is not\na member of the Bar, or for a member of the Bar in his non-professional\ncapacity, may be improper for an advocate in his professional capacity.\n\n25. Section II of the said Chapter II provides for duties of an advocate\ntowards his client. Rules 15 and 19 of the BCI Rules, have relevance to\nthe subject-matter and therefore, they are extracted below:\n\n\f 52\n\n “15. It shall be the duty of an advocate fearlessly to uphold the\n interests of his client by all fair and honourable means without\n regard to any unpleasant consequences to himself or any other. He\n shall defend a person accused of a crime regardless of his personal\n opinion as to the guilt of the accused, bearing in mind that his loyalty\n is to the law which requires that no man should be convicted without\n adequate evidence.\n\n ***\n\n 19. An advocate shall not act on the instructions of any person other\n than his client or his authorised agent.”\n\n26. While Rule 15 mandates that the advocate must uphold the interest of\nhis clients by fair and honourable means without regard to any unpleasant\nconsequences to himself or any other. Rule 19 prescribes that an advocate\nshall only act on the instructions of his client or his authorised agent.\n\nFurther, the BCI Rules in Chapter I of the said Section II provide that the\nSenior Advocates in the matter of their practice of the profession of law\nmentioned in \nSection 30\n of the 1961 Act would be subject to certain\nrestrictions. One of such restrictions contained in clause (cc) reads as\nunder:\n\n “(cc) A Senior Advocate shall, however, be free to make concessions\n or give undertaking in the course of arguments on behalf of his\n clients on instructions from the junior advocate.”\n\n27. Further, the “Code of Ethics” prescribed by the Bar Council of India,\nin recognition of the evolution in professional and ethical standards within\nthe legal community, provides for certain rules which contain canons of\nconduct and etiquette which ought to serve as general guide to the practice\nand profession. Chapter III of the said Code provides for an “Advocate's\nduty to the client”. Rule 26 thereunder mandates that an “advocate shall\nnot make any compromise or concession without the proper and specific\ninstructions of his/her client”. It is pertinent to notice that an advocate\nunder the Code expressly includes a group of advocates and a law firm\nwhose partner or associate acts for the client.\n\n28. Therefore, the BCI Rules make it necessary that despite the specific\nlegal stream of practice, seniority at the Bar or designation of an advocate\nas a Senior Advocate, the ethical duty and the professional standards\ninsofar as making concessions before the Court remain the same. It is\nexpected of the lawyers to obtain necessary instructions from the clients\nor the authorised agent before making any concession/statement before\nthe court for and on behalf of the client.\n\n\f 53\n\n29. While the BCI Rules and the Act, do not draw any exception to the\nnecessity of an advocate obtaining instructions before making any\nconcession on behalf of the client before the court, this Court in \nPeriyar\n& Pareekanni Rubber Ltd. v. State of Kerala\n [(1991) 4 SCC 195] has\nnoticed the sui generis status and the position of responsibility enjoyed by\nthe Advocate General in regard to the statements made by him before the\ncourts. The said observation is as under: (SCC p. 209, para 19)\n“19. … Any concession made by the Government Pleader in the trial court\ncannot bind the Government as it is obviously, always, unsafe to rely on\nthe wrong or erroneous or wanton concession made by the counsel\nappearing for the State unless it is in writing on instructions from the\nresponsible officer. Otherwise it would place undue and needless heavy\nburden on the public exchequer.\n \nBut the same yardstick cannot be applied\nwhen the Advocate General has made a statement across the Bar since the\nAdvocate General makes the statement with all responsibility.”\n(See: \nJoginder Singh Wasu v. State of Punjab\n [(1994) 1 SCC 184] .)\n\n30. The Privy Council in \nSourendra Nath Mitra v. Tarubala Dasi\n [(1929-\n\n30) 57 IA 133 : (1930) 31 LW 803 : AIR 1930 PC 158] , has made the\nfollowing two observations which hold relevance to the present\ndiscussion: (IA pp. 140-41)\n“Two observations may be added. First, the implied authority of counsel\nis not an appendage of office, a dignity added by the courts to the status\nof barrister or advocate at law. It is implied in the interests of the client,\nto give the fullest beneficial effect to his employment of the advocate.\nSecondly, the implied authority can always be countermanded by the\nexpress directions of the client. No advocate has actual authority to settle\na case against the express instructions of his client. If he considers such\nexpress instructions contrary to the interests of his client, his remedy is to\nreturn his brief.”\n(See: \nJamilabai Abdul Kadar v. Shankarlal Gulabchand\n [(\n1975) 2 SCC\n609] and Svenska Handelsbanken v. Indian Charge Chrome Ltd.\n [(1994)\n2 SCC 155] )\n\n31. Therefore, it is the solemn duty of an advocate not to transgress the\nauthority conferred on him by the client. It is always better to seek\nappropriate instructions from the client or his authorised agent before\nmaking any concession which may, directly or remotely, affect the rightful\nlegal right of the client. The advocate represents the client before the court\nand conducts proceedings on behalf of the client. He is the only link\nbetween the court and the client. Therefore his responsibility is onerous.\nHe is expected to follow the instructions of his client rather than substitute\nhis judgment.\n\n\f 54\n\n 32. Generally, admissions of fact made by a counsel are binding upon\n their principals as long as they are unequivocal; where, however, doubt\n exists as to a purported admission, the court should be wary to accept such\n admissions until and unless the counsel or the advocate is authorised by\n his principal to make such admissions. Furthermore, a client is not bound\n by a statement or admission which he or his lawyer was not authorised to\n make. A lawyer generally has no implied or apparent authority to make\n an admission or statement which would directly surrender or conclude the\n substantial legal rights of the client unless such an admission or statement\n is clearly a proper step in accomplishing the purpose for which the lawyer\n was employed. We hasten to add neither the client nor the court is bound\n by the lawyer's statements or admissions as to matters of law or legal\n conclusions. Thus, according to generally accepted notions of\n professional responsibility, lawyers should follow the client's instructions\n rather than substitute their judgment for that of the client. We may add\n that in some cases, lawyers can make decisions without consulting the\n client. While in others, the decision is reserved for the client. It is often\n said that the lawyer can make decisions as to tactics without consulting\n the client, while the client has a right to make decisions that can affect his\n rights.\n\n 33. We do not intend to prolong this discussion. We may conclude by\n noticing a famous statement of Lord Brougham:\n\n “an advocate, in the discharge of his duty knows but one person in\n the world and that person is his client”. [Ed.: The statement was\n made by Mr Henry Brougham, as His Lordship then was, while\n defending Queen Caroline in the House of Lords. See The Whole\n Proceedings on The Trial of Her Majesty, Caroline Amelia\n Elizabeth, Queen of England, for “Adulterous Intercourse” with\n Bartolomeo Bergami, Vol. II, p. 2 containing Her Majesty's Defence,\n printed and published by John Fairburn, Broadway, Ludgate Hill\n (1820).]”\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n102. We also refer to the decision of this Court in the case of \nByram Pestonji\nGariwala\n (supra), more particularly, the observations made in para 37, which read thus:\n\n “37. We may, however, hasten to add that it will be prudent for counsel\n not to act on implied authority except when warranted by the exigency of\n circumstances demanding immediate adjustment of suit by agreement or\n compromise and the signature of the party cannot be obtained without\n undue delay. In these days of easier and quicker communication, such\n contingency may seldom arise. A wise and careful counsel will no doubt\n arm himself in advance with the necessary authority expressed in writing\n\n\f 55\n\n to meet all such contingencies in order that neither his authority nor\n integrity is ever doubted. This essential precaution will safeguard the\n personal reputation of counsel as well as uphold the prestige and dignity\n of the legal profession.” (Emphasis supplied)\n\n103. Almost six decades back, the Madras High Court speaking through Justice\nRamaswami (as His Lordship then was) in the case of \nGovindammal v. Marimuthu\nMaistry and Others\n reported in AIR 1959 Mad 7 had sounded the note of caution\nobserving as under:\n\n “5. … The decisions appear to be fairly clear that even in cases where\n there is no express authorization to enter into a compromise, under the\n inherent authority impliedly given to the Vakil he has power to enter into\n the compromise on behalf of his client. But in the present state of the\n clientele world and the position in which the Bar now finds itself and in\n the face of divided judicial authority and absence of statutory backing\n prudence dictates that unless express power is given in the vakalatnama\n itself to enter into compromise, in accordance with the general practice\n obtaining a special vakalatnama should be filed or the specific consent of\n the party to enter into the compromise should be obtained. If an\n endorsement is made on the plaint etc., it would be better to get the\n signature or the thumb impression of the party affixed thereto, making it\n evident that the party is aware of what is being done by the Vakil on his\n or her behalf.”\n\n104. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the High Court committed\nno error in holding that the settlement between the Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 resply was\nunlawful.\n\nOUR FINAL CONCLUSIONS\n\n105. We may draw our final conclusions as under:\n\n (i) The preliminary decree drawn by the Trial Court as affirmed by the High\n Court is modified to the extent that the daughters are entitled to 1/3rd share\n in all the properties scheduled in the plaint i.e., ancestral and self-acquired\n properties of Late Shri Kumar Sahoo. The Trial Court shall modify the\n\n\f 56\n\n decree accordingly.\n\n (ii) As we have held that the settlement between the Original Defendant Nos.\n\n 1 and 2 resply was not in accordance with law, the Appellants herein will\n not be entitled to the share of the Original Defendant No. 2.\n\n (iii) The Appellants shall be entitled to only their 1/3rd share in the suit\n properties.\n\n (iv) Since the Defendant No. 1 was appointed as receiver, the Appellants shall\n now furnish accounts before the Trial Court.\n\n106. With the aforesaid clarifications, both the Appeals fail and are hereby dismissed.\n\n107. This litigation by now is almost four decades old. The Original Plaintiff as on\ndate is almost 85 years of age. In such circumstances, the Trial Court shall draw the\nfinal decree within a period of three months from the date of receipt of the certified\ncopy of this judgment and order.\n\n108. Parties to bear their own costs.\n\n109. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.\n\n ………………………………………..J.\n (A.S. BOPANNA)\n\n ………………………………………..J.\n (J.B.

From the copy of the petition which was filed on February\n27, 1991 it appears that the terms and conditions of settlement and\nagreement had been mentioned saying that both parties had entered into\na compromise because of which the plaintiff-appellant had thereafter no\nconnection with the disputed land and defendant-respondent shall be\ndeemed to be in possession and the owner of the said disputed land. The\nprayer made in the said petition also says that the compromise may be\nordered to be accepted. On basis of that petition, as already mentioned\nabove, the court passed an order saying that the compromise had been\naccepted. In the order it has been mentioned that the suit of the plaintiff\nbe “dismissed as per compromise deed Ex. C”. In view of the aforesaid\nfacts and circumstances, it is difficult to hold that by order dated February\n27, 1991 the Court allowed the suit to be withdrawn in terms of Rule 1 of\nOrder 23. The order on face of it purported to dismiss the suit of the\nplaintiff on basis of the terms and conditions mentioned in the petition of\ncompromise. As such, the validity of that order has to be judged treating\nit to be an order deemed to have been passed in purported exercise of the\npower conferred on the Court by Rule 3 of Order 23 of the Code. The\nlearned Subordinate Judge should not have accepted the said petition of\ncompromise even if he had no knowledge of the fraud alleged to have been\npractised on the appellant by his counsel, because admittedly the petition\nof compromise had not been signed either by the respondent or his\ncounsel.

Therefore, it is urged that the same is not legal compromise as\n provided under Order 23, Rule 3, \nCPC\n and on behalf of defendant no.2 her\n advocate could not have signed the compromise petition as she has not\n executed special 'vakalatnama' giving the authorization in favour of her\n lawyer to compromise the matter between defendant no.1 and 2 In the First\n Appeal. Therefore, First Appellate Judge should not have received the\n compromise petition and accepted the same. The acceptance of the\n compromise petition by the learned Single Judge should have entered\n between the parties including the plaintiff. \nIn support of the said legal\n contention, reliance is placed by the learned counsel on behalf of defendant\n no.2 on the decisions of the apex Court in \nRamasrey & Puspa Devi\n (supra).\n The compromise petition is in variance to the schedule properties of the suit\n and, therefore, it is voidable. The compromise was neither recorded by the\n first appellate court at the time-of filing compromise petition in writing, nor\n the parties were present in the court nor signed the petition in court.\n Therefore, the alleged compromise cannot be termed as compromise\n between the parties in relation to the subject matter covered therein as the\n same is illegal for the reason that it is opposed to Order 23, Rule 3, \nCPC\n.\n Hence the learned Single Judge could not have accepted the same.\n \nIn support\n of this contention, learned Single Judge had rightly \nplaced reliance upon\n the\n decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court In the case of \nGurpreet Singh v.\n Chatur Bhuj Goel\n, AIR 1988 SC 400; and of this Court in the case of \nSanyasi\n Jena and others v. Mina Jena and others\n, AIR 1984 Orissa 213.\n \nFurther the\n reliance placed by the learned counsel for the defendant no.1 upon the\n judgment of \nPuspa Devi\n (supra) is distinguished by defendant no.2 counsel\n stating that compromise petition is being typed in English. Further the same\n is not signed by defendantno.2. Defendant no.1 with a view to deprive\n allotment of share assigned in favour of defendant no.2 by the trial court in\n respect of the suit schedule properties in the absence of signing the\n compromise petition by defendant no.2 and there is no special 'vakalatnama'\n executed in favour of her lawyer, the said compromise petition is unlawful\n and the same could not have been accepted by the first appellate court In the\n Impugned judgment and modified the trial court judgment. Therefore, the\n cross-objection/appeal filed by defendant no.2 has to be allowed by setting\n aside the compromise recorded by the first appellate court In the Impugned\n judgment by modifying trial court judgment in relation to the share of the\n defendant no.2 allotted in respect of the suit schedule properties.

The third question that arises for our consideration in context with the legality\nand validity of the settlement is whether the learned advocate appearing for the cross-\nobjector i.e., Defendant No. 2 could have signed the compromise petition without an\nexpress consent.

Indisputably, in the case on hand, the First\nAppellate Court had neither recorded the statements of the parties in the Court nor had\nmade any inquiry into the terms of the settlement.

Furthermore, a client is not bound\n by a statement or admission which he or his lawyer was not authorised to\n make. A lawyer generally has no implied or apparent authority to make\n an admission or statement which would directly surrender or conclude the\n substantial legal rights of the client unless such an admission or statement\n is clearly a proper step in accomplishing the purpose for which the lawyer\n was employed. We hasten to add neither the client nor the court is bound\n by the lawyer's statements or admissions as to matters of law or legal\n conclusions. Thus, according to generally accepted notions of\n professional responsibility, lawyers should follow the client's instructions\n rather than substitute their judgment for that of the client. We may add\n that in some cases, lawyers can make decisions without consulting the\n client. While in others, the decision is reserved for the client.
