Today also no one has appeared for the petitioner in\n spite of repeated calls. As such, I have gone through the record.\n\n This revision application is directed against the order dated\n 09.02.2005 passed by Sri Krishna Murari Gupta, learned Additional Sessions\n Judge, Fast Track Court-II, Garhwa, in Criminal Rev. No. 189 of 2001,\n whereby the Court below allowed the revision, giving discretion to the Court\n of S.D.M. Garhwa to pass necessary orders by invoking or exercising the\n power u/s 311 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n It appears from the impugned order that a proceeding\n u/s 145\n Cr.P.C.\n was going on between the parties in the Court of S.D.M., Garhwa, in Misc.\n Case No. 173 of 1997 and an order was passed on 29.11.2011, asking the\n Notary Public to appear before the Court on 05.12.2001 with the affidavit\n register.\n\n The said order was challenged in the Revisional Court below and the\n Court below found that the said order was not passed in exercise of the\n power\n u/s 311\n of the Cr.P.C. The Court below also took into consideration the\n fact that such applications were filed earlier, which were rejected by the\n S.D.M. Garhwa. The Revisional Court below allowed the revision application\n and set aside the impugned order, but gave the option to the learned S.D.M.,\n Garhwa to invoke the power\n u/s 311\n of the Cr.P.C. if the evidence of the\n Notary Public appeared to be essential for just decision of the case and with\n this observation the Criminal Revision was allowed.\n\n I do not find any illegality and / or irregularity in the impugned order,\n worth interference in the revisional jurisdiction. There is no merit in this\n application, which is accordingly, dismissed.

Jha, learned Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad, in Chirkunda P.S. Case\n No. 96 of 2011, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 1693 of 2011, whereby the\n Court below has rejected the application filed by the petitioner for release\n of the seized iron scrap in connection with this case in favour of the\n petitioner.\n\n The impugned order shows that the petitioner had produced the\n documents with respect to the purchase of the iron scrap on which a report\n was called for from the concerned police station. The Court below however,\n upon getting the report of the concerned police station, opined that the\n Investigating Officer had not verified the genuineness of the documents\n though the Investigating Officer had stated that on the basis of the cash\n memo produced by the accused petitioner it had transpired that the\n petitioner had purchased the iron scrap from the dealers.\n\n In view of the fact that the said report was not given by the\n Investigating Officer after verifying the genuineness of the documents of\n the seized iron scrap, the Court below ought to have directed the\n Investigating Officer to submit the report after proper verification about the\n genuineness of the documents and to have disposed of the application\n upon getting the report.\n\n As such, the impugned order dated 23.01.2012 passed by Sri K. K.\n Jha, learned Judicial Magistrate, Dhanbad, in Chirkunda P.S. Case No. 96 of\n 2011, corresponding to G.R. Case No. 1693 of 2011, is hereby, set aside\n and it is directed that the Court below shall direct the Officer Incharge of\n the police station to submit the report after proper verification of the\n documents produced by the petitioner and the Court below shall pass the\n order afresh upon getting the verification report from the police station.\n\n This revision application is accordingly, allowed with the directions as\n above.\n\n (H.C.Mishra, J.)\nD.S.\n IN THE HIGH COURT OF JHARKHAND AT RANCHI\n\n Cr. Rev. No. 85 of 2012\n\n -------\n\n Shambhu Nath Agarwal ..... Petitioner\n\n -Versus-\n\n The State of Jharkhand ..... Opposite Party\n\n -------\n\n CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE H.C.MISHRA\n\n -------\n\n For the Petitioner: : M/s.A.K.Chaturvedi\n For the State: : M/s. Ravi Prakash, A.P.P.\n\n -------\n\n02/ 21.09.2012. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\n counsel for the State.\n\n The petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 20.9.2011\n passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Simdega, in\n Simdega P.S. Case No. 17 of 2005, corresponding to G.R. No. 58 of\n 2005, whereby the application filed by the petitioner for release of\n the truck in question in favour of the petitioner was rejected by the\n Court below stating that no document was produced by the\n petitioner with respect to the seized truck.\n\n It appears that the a truck was seized by the police, as it was\n found with 225 bags of wheat and Simdega P.S. Case No. 17 of 2005,\n corresponding to G.R. No. 58 of 2005 was registered for the offence\n u/s 414, 120(B) of the \nIndian Penal Code\n and \nSection 7\n of the\n Essential Commodities Act. The son of the petitioner was also made\n accused in the case.\n\n It appears from the impugned order that a confiscation\n proceeding with respect to the truck in question was initiated and\n the truck was confiscated by the order of the D.C. Simdega. The said\n confiscation of the truck was challanged before the Sessions Judge\n Simdega, and the confiscation of the truck was set aside. It also\n appears from the impugned order that the order taking cognizance\n was also challenged by the son of the petitioner, who was an\n accused in the case, and the order taking cognizance was also set\n aside and the case has been dropped against the son of the\n petitioner.\n\n The petitioner, claiming himself to be the owner of the truck,\n filed the application for the release of the truck in question stating\n that the original documents were seized along with the truck and he\n had no documents left with him. His application was rejected by the\n Court below by the impugned order dated 20.9.2011.\n\n Learned counsel for the petitioner had drawn the attention of\n this Court towards Annexure-5, which appears to be the copy of a\n report called for by the Officer Incharge of Simdega Police Station,\n mentioning that there was no document with respect to the truck in\n\n -2-\n\n question and asking the District Transport Officer, Ranchi, to report\n about the ownership of the truck and it appears that the District\n Transport Officer, Ranchi, had reported that the truck belonged to\n the petitioner. However, it appears that this document has also not\n been discussed in the impugned order.\n\n In view of the fact that the original documents of the truck are\n not available, in the peculiar facts of this case, I am of the\n considered view that the Court below should have taken into\n consideration the report of the District Transport Officer, Ranchi, if\n any, available on the record, or aught to have called for a fresh\n report from the District Transport Officer, Ranchi, and to have\n passed the appropriate order in accordance with law. It goes without\n saying that if the ownership of the truck is found to be with the\n petitioner, the truck should be released in favour of the petitioner, as\n the criminal case as well as the confiscation proceeding, have\n already been dropped.\n\n With these directions, the impugned order dated 20.9.2011\n passed by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Simdega, in\n Simdega P.S. Case No. 17 of 2005, corresponding to G.R. No. 58 of\n 2005, is hereby set aside and the Court below is directed to pass the\n order afresh in view of the directions as above. This revision\n application is accordingly, allowed with the directions as above.\n\n (H.C.Mishra, J.)\nD.S.",
