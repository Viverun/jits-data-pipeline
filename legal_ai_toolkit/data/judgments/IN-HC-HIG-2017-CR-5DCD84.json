Final report under\nSection 173\nCr.P.C.\n\nhas been presented qua the accused Roop Kishore (husband of the deceased)\n\nunder\nSections 302\n/\n304B\n/\n/\n120B\nIPC.\n\nThe facts for the sake of convenience are extracted from CRM\n\nNo.M-980 of 2017 preferred by Manju (sister-in-law of the deceased) and\n\nMukesh (son of Manju).\n\nThe abovesaid FIR was registered on the statement of the\n\ncomplainant, Vinod Soni i.e., the brother of the deceased. As per the allegations\n\nin the FIR, the deceased was married to Roop Kishore (in custody) on\n\n3 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-4-\n\n20.01.2010. Roop Kishore was working at PGI Chandigarh. He alongwith the\n\ncomplainant's sister lived in a rented house at Chandigarh. The complainant's\n\nsister, it is stated, was harassed by Roop Kishore and his family members to\n\nextract money from her parents for purchasing a house. It is stated that money\n\nwas given to Roop Kishore through Bank transfer and cash for the purpose of\n\npurchasing a flat. A flat was purchased by Roop Kishore in the name of the\n\ncomplainant's sister. She was however further harassed to bring another sum of\n\n`10,00,000/- from her parental home. She was not allowed to use her gold\n\njewellery. Roop Kishore was living alongwith his family in the said flat at\n\nOmaxe City since one year prior to the date of incident in question. Nephew of\n\nRoop Kishore i.e., the petitioner - Mukesh is alleged to be residing with them for\n\nthe purposes of study and treatment. The complainant stated that his sister told\n\nhim telephonically on 09.06.2016 that her mother-in-law Sarju Devi came to\n\ntheir residence 10-15 days prior thereto. Thereafter, Roop Kishore was\n\nphysically abusing the complainant's sister and threatening to kill her. Roop\n\nKishore, Sarju Devi and Suman Nath are alleged to have physically abused the\n\ncomplainant's sister on 09.06.2016. Petitioner - Suman Nath was alleged to be\n\nhaving illicit relations with the husband of the deceased Roop Kishore for the\n\npast 4-5 years. Roop Kishore and husband of Suman Nath were working\n\ntogether at PGI, Chandigarh and were earlier residing near each other. The\n\ncomplainant received a Whatsapp message on 10.06.2016 from his sister's\n\nmobile stating that her mother-in-law, sister-in-law and neighbour Suman Nath\n\nare responsible for her death. The complainant tried to contact his sister and her\n\nhusband Roop Kishore but his call was not attended. He informed his elder\n\n4 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-5-\n\nbrother at Hyderabad and ultimately, the complainant and his brother reached\n\nChandigarh on the intervening night of 10th and 11th June, 2016. The deceased\n\ncommitted suicide by hanging with a Dupatta due to harassment and ill-treatment\n\nmeted out to her by her husband Roop Kishore, mother-in-law Sarju Devi, sister-\n\nin-law Manju, nephew Mukesh and Suman Nath, neighbour. Husband of the\n\ndeceased was alleged to have absconded after admitting the complainant's sister\n\nat PGI. FIR was registered under\nSections 304B\n/\n120B\nIPC.\nSections 302\n/\nIPC were added subsequently. Cause of death is mentioned to be death due to\n\nhanging. Co-accused Roop Kishore is admittedly in custody and facing trial.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioners - Manju and Mukesh submits\n\nthat the said petitioners are permanent residents of Chennai. Reference is made\n\nto the ration card, LPG connection, bank account (Annexures P3, collectively).\n\nPetitioner - Mukesh, it is submitted, has received his entire education at Chennai\n\nand is now working with a multi-national company, namely, TIG MIG Plasma\n\nBuilding and Services at Jamanagarwala Complex, Chennai. Reference is made\n\nto his academic certificates as well as certificates of work experience, Annexures\n\nP6 (collectively) and P7 (collectively).\n\nManju, it is submitted, had come to visit Chandigarh only for the\n\npurpose of seeking consultation at PGI. Petitioner - Manju is suffering from\n\nvarious chronic ailments. Reference is made to her medical record/treatment at\n\nChennai from 2006 onwards (Annexure P4, collectively). It is thus contended\n\nthat there is no question of any harassment or ill-treatment meted out to the\n\ndeceased at their hands.\n\nIt is further urged that the deceased herself was keeping poor health.\n\n5 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-6-\n\nShe was suffering from multifarious ailments. Learned counsel refers to the\n\nmedical record of the deceased regarding her treatment at PGI Chandigarh\n\n(Annexure P2). As per the treatment summary dated 16.11.2016 issued by PGI,\n\nChandigarh, it is mentioned that the deceased had approached the Rheumatology\n\nOut Patient Department (OPD) on 16.08.2014 with complaints of inflammatory\n\ntype low back and neck pain. She was found to have bilateral sacroiliac joint\n\ntenderness and MRI of sacroiliac joints was suggestive of left sided early\n\nsacroilitis. It is mentioned that the Doctor attending the patient on 04.07.2015 in\n\nrheumatology OPD noted that the patient had features suggestive of depression.\n\nShe was advised to take Psychiatry consultation for appropriate management.\n\nThereafter, in August 2015, she was evaluated in gastroentrology Department for\n\nloss of appetite, loss of weight and constipation. Colonoscopy showed multiple\n\nulcers in terminal ileum and biopsy from ulcer showed ulcerated epithelium with\n\ncryptitis, crypt abscess and crypt loss.\n\nIt is urged that it is due to the medical condition of the deceased that\n\nshe committed suicide. The present FIR has been registered only with a view to\n\nunnecessarily rope in all the family members in the case. It is further submitted\n\nthat it was the second marriage of the deceased with Roop Kishore. Learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners vehemently urge that the complainant side had lodged\n\nFIR No.225 dated 04.06.2005 under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\nIPC against the\n\nfirst husband of the deceased as well. Moreover, the complainant himself is\n\nstated to be facing proceedings in FIR No. 67 of 2015, Mahila Police Station,\n\nBikaner under\nSections 498A\n/\n/\n/\n/\nIPC. It is vehemently argued\n\nthat the medical evidence on record falsifies the prosecution version as the post-\n\n6 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-7-\n\nmortem report does not indicate any injuries on the person of the deceased.\n\nNeither is there any evidence to show that the deceased was ever subjected to\n\nany ill-treatment or harassment at the hands of the petitioners. The brother of the\n\ndeceased has thus lodged this complaint against the petitioners with ulterior\n\nmotives.\n\nIt is further submitted that the petitioners Manju and Mukesh had\n\nfiled an application seeking the concession of anticipatory bail before the learned\n\nSessions Judge, Mohali on 19.12.2016. The same was dismissed on 27.12.2016\n\n(Annexure P8). They were afforded the benefit of anticipatory bail on\n\n16.01.2017 itself by this Court. The counsel for the complainant, it is submitted,\n\nwas present before this Court on 16.01.2017. Proceedings under\nSection 82\n\nCr.P.C. were undertaken in complete violation of the provisions of law.\n\nPendency of such proceedings were never brought to the notice of the learned\n\nSessions Judge, Mohali. Petitioners - Manju and Mukesh are residents of\n\nChennai and admittedly no proclamation was ever made at their place of\n\nresidence. Thus order dated 16.01.2017 has been passed in utter violation of the\n\nprovisions of law. Moreover, the petitioners have joined investigation and it\n\ncannot be said that they are evading the process of law.\n\nIn respect to the petitioner - Sarju Devi i.e., the mother-in-law of the\n\ndeceased, it is submitted that she is an old woman suffering from various\n\ndiseases as apparent from the medical record (Annexure P6 in CRM No.M-\n\n10793 of 2017). It is further submitted that the petitioner Sarju Devi is a resident\n\nof Rajasthan. It is vehemently argued that the petitioner - Sarju Devi had, in\n\nfact, transferred a substantial amount of money in the account of the deceased.\n\n7 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-8-\n\nReference is made to the documents attached as Annexure P2, collectively in\n\nCRM No.M-10793 of 2017. Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that had\n\nthere been any demand of dowry etc. from the deceased, it is not possible that the\n\nmother-in-law of the deceased would have transferred the said amount of money\n\nin her account. Moreover, allegations of demand of dowry for purchase of the\n\nflat/house in question are absolutely incorrect. There is nothing on record to\n\nsubstantiate such allegations. The said flat was purchased in the name of the\n\ndeceased which negates the allegation of demand of dowry. There are no\n\nspecific allegations against the petitioner to point out commission of any offence\n\nby the present petitioner. The petitioner Sarju Devi is stated to be 77 years old,\n\nsuffering from multifarious diseases. It is submitted that she visited Chandigarh\n\noccasionally for the purpose of her treatment at PGI, Chandigarh. There is no\n\nquestion of any harassment or demand of dowry being raised by her.\n\nIn respect to order dated 16.01.2017 whereby the petitioner - Sarju\n\nDevi was declared to be a proclaimed offender, it is submitted that the petitioner\n\nhas not evaded the process of law in any manner. Order dated 16.01.2017 has\n\nbeen passed in complete violation of the provisions of law. The petitioner Sarju\n\nDevi, at the first instance filed a petition under\nSection 438\nCr.P.C. on\n\n17.01.2017/21.01.2017. The said petition was dismissed by the learned Sessions\n\nJudge, Mohali on 09.03.2017. It is vehemently argued that the fact of the\n\npetitioner being declared a proclaimed offender was not even brought to the\n\nnotice of the learned Sessions Judge by the prosecution which clearly shows the\n\nillegal manner in which the said order has been passed with an oblique motive.\n\n8 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-9-\n\nIn respect to the petitioner - Suman Nath, learned counsel argues\n\nthat she has nothing, whatsoever, to do with the controversy in hand. Husband\n\nof petitioner - Suman Nath and Roop Kishore were working together at PGI.\n\nShe has unnecessarily been embroiled in the controversy. There is nothing on\n\nrecord to show that she had illicit relations with the husband of the deceased.\n\nThe allegations are totally baseless, false and incorrect. It is stated that the\n\npetitioner-Suman Nath alongwith her husband resided in rented accommodation\n\nin Dhanas, Chandigarh whereas, Roop Kishore shifted to Omaxe City,\n\nMullanpur. Her husband had a flat in Omaxe City and he used to visit the\n\nhusband of the deceased when they shifted to Omaxe City in order to help him\n\ntake care of his ailing mother who had come to his residence about ten days prior\n\nto the incident in question. It is urged that the deceased was herself suffering\n\nfrom numerous problems including emotional and psychological problems. In\n\nrespect to order dated 16.01.2017 (Annexure P7 in CRM No.M-5792 of 2017), it\n\nis reiterated that the same has been passed in violation of the settled provisions\n\nof law. The petitioner - Suman Nath, it is stated, was not even residing at\n\nOmaxe City. The said flat was lying locked and none resided there. Petitioner\n\nwas never served in the proceedings under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. In a totally mala\n\nfide manner, notice is stated to be issued at the address of Omaxe City,\n\nMullanpur. Moreover, the petitioner had approached the learned Sessions Judge\n\nfor the concession of anticipatory bail on 23.12.2016, which was declined on\n\n27.12.2016. Thereafter, the petitioner approached this Court by way of filing\n\nCRM No.M-1218 of 2017 on 13.01.2017. The matter came up before this Court\n\n9 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-10-\n\non 18.01.2017 when notice of motion was issued and the matter was directed to\n\nbe listed alongwith CRM No.M-980 of 2017. The complete violation of the\n\nprovisions of law before passing order dated 16.01.2017 is apparent from the fact\n\nthat the pendency of proceedings under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. were not even\n\nbrought to the notice of the learned Sessions Judge during the pendency of the\n\npetitioner's bail application. The petitioner was thus completely unaware of the\n\nsaid proceedings against her. It cannot be said that she is evading the process of\n\nlaw. Moreover, she has joined investigation pursuant to interim order of this\n\nCourt.\n\nLearned counsel for all the petitioners submit that the deceased was\n\nsuffering from various ailments including psychological problems. Order dated\n\n16.01.2017 declaring them proclaimed offenders is in clear violation of the\n\nprovisions of law. It cannot be said that the petitioners, who were availing the\n\nlegal remedies available to them, were evading the process of law in any manner.\n\nThe petitioners undertake to face the proceedings in this case and join\n\ninvestigation. There is no question of their absconding from the process of law\n\nin any manner. To the contrary, lack of bona fides on the part of the complainant\n\nside, it is urged, are apparent from the fact that the petitioners - Mukesh and\n\nManju were declared to be proclaimed offenders on 16.01.2017 i.e., the day on\n\nwhich interim relief was afforded to them by this Court. It is submitted that the\n\ncounsel for the complainant was duly present at that time.\n\nIt is thus prayed that order dated 16.01.2017 declaring the\n\npetitioners to be proclaimed offenders be set aside and the concession of\n\nanticipatory bail be afforded to all the petitioners.\n\n10 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-11-\n\nLearned counsel for the State as well as the complainant have\n\nopposed these petitions. Learned counsel for the State while referring to\n\naffidavit dated 27.03.2017 of Mr. Lakhbir Singh, PPS, Deputy Superintendent of\n\nPolice, Sub Division Kharar, SAS Nagar (Mohali) filed in CRM No.M-980 of\n\n2017 submits that warrants of arrest of all the petitioners were obtained from the\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction on 02.07.2016 for 28.07.2016. Raids were\n\nconducted at village Merta in Rajasthan in association with the personnel of\n\nPolice Station Merta but they could not be apprehended. Warrants of arrest were\n\nagain issued on 31.08.2016 for 17.09.2016. Raids were yet again conducted at\n\nvillage Merta in Rajasthan at the residence of the petitioner - Sarju Devi\n\n(mother-in-law of the deceased). Another daughter-in-law of the petitioner -\n\nSarju Devi recorded her statement to the effect that Sarju Devi, Mukesh and\n\nManju were not visiting the said house and she was not aware of the present\n\naddresses of these persons. Warrants of arrest were again issued on 20.09.2016\n\nfor 29.10.2016. Raids were yet again conducted at village Merta. Statement of\n\nOm Parkash, the another son of petitioner - Sarju Devi was recorded. He\n\nspecifically stated that the petitioners - Manju and Mukesh were residing at\n\nMadras (Chennai) for the last 30-35 years but he did not have their address.\n\nResidence of the petitioner - Suman Nath at Mullanpur was raided but was\n\nfound locked. Proceedings under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. were initiated against them\n\non 02.11.2016. Copies of proclamation were pasted at Bus Stand, Khajwana\n\n(Rajasthan) and Bus Stand, Mullanpur (Punjab) and outside the house of the\n\npetitioners at Rajasthan on 29.11.2016. Copy of the proclamation was also\n\npasted outside the court complex Kharar and another at the gate of the petitioner\n\n11 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-12-\n\n- Suman Nath's house in the presence of Varinder Singh, Security Guard at\n\nOmaxe City, Mohali. All the petitioners were ultimately declared proclaimed\n\noffenders on 16.01.2017. It is further submitted that specific allegations have\n\nbeen levelled against all the accused-petitioners. As per the FSL report,\n\nsignatures on the copy of the suicide note tally with the admitted signatures of\n\nthe deceased.\n\nLearned counsel for the complainant refers to affidavit dated\n\n01.03.2011 (Annexure A1 in CRM No.M-1218 of 2017) allegedly executed by\n\nthe co-accused Roop Kishore at Rajasthan. As per the said affidavit, the co-\n\naccused Roop Kishore (in custody) stated that he would not maintain illicit\n\nrelation with Suman Nath who physically abused his wife (the deceased). He\n\nfurther admitted that Suman Nath tried to kill his wife by giving some poisonous\n\nsubstance. It is further stated that his mother, sister and the sister's son tried to\n\nkill his wife by throwing her in Water Tank at Meidta City. He further stated that\n\nhe would not allow such incidents to take place in future and would ensure that\n\nthe said family members would not harass his wife for money. It is submitted\n\nthat in view of the specific allegations against the accused persons, all these\n\npetitions should be dismissed.\n\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have gone\n\nthrough the files with their able assistance.\n\nAs per the allegations in the FIR, the complainant's sister was\n\nmarried to Roop Kishore (non-applicant). She was allegedly harassed by her\n\nhusband and the other family members for arranging money from her parents for\n\npurchasing a house. Money was allegedly transferred to Roop Kishore through\n\n12 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-13-\n\nbank and cash. A flat was resultantly purchased in the name of the complainant's\n\nsister. She was further harassed for bringing another sum of `10,00,000/-. She\n\nwas not allowed to use her gold jewellery. It is stated that Mukesh i.e., the son of\n\nsister-in-law of the deceased was residing with them for purpose of his studies.\n\nThe complainant's sister called the complainant on 09.06.2016 and informed him\n\nthat her mother-in-law Sarju Devi had come to stay with them since the last 10-\n\n15 days. Thereafter her husband Roop Kishore was physically abusing her and\n\nthreatening to kill her. On the said date Roop Kishore, Sarju Devi and Suman\n\nNath physically abused the deceased. Illicit relations between Roop Kishore and\n\nSuman Nath were alleged. The complainant's sister earlier told the complainant\n\nthat her sister-in-law Manju and her son Mukesh physically abused her in the\n\nflat. Reference is also made to a picture of Whatsapp message i.e., a note\n\nallegedly written by the deceased that her mother-in-law, sister-in-law and\n\nneighbour Suman Nath are responsible for her death.\n\nIt is relevant to note that there is no denial of the medical record of\n\nthe deceased appended with these petitions. It is further not denied that as per\n\nthe post-mortem report, no injury was found on the person of the deceased. The\n\nveracity, effect or otherwise of affidavit allegedly executed by the co-accused\n\nRoop Kishore on 01.03.2011 at Bikaner shall, needless to say, be looked into by\n\nthe investigating agency/trial court.\n\nThe petitioners Manju and Mukesh have placed on record various\n\ndocuments to show that they are residents of Chennai. The educational\n\ncertificates of the petitioners Mukesh as well as his work experience are on\n\n13 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-14-\n\nrecord as well. In affidavit dated 27.03.2017 of Mr. Lakhbir Singh, PPS, Deputy\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Sub Division Kharar, SAS Nagar (Mohali) reference is\n\nmade to the statement of another son of Sarju Devi (brother and uncle of the\n\npetitioners Manju and Mukesh, respectively) to the effect that they were living at\n\nChennai for the last 30-35 years. There is further reference to the statement of\n\nSuresh Shankla to the effect that the house in question had been sold by the\n\nowners who were residing at Madras (Chennai) for the last 10 years and their\n\npresent whereabouts were not known to him.\n\nIn respect to the petitioner - Suman Nath (an erstwhile neighbour of\n\nthe deceased) in CRM No.M-5792 of 2017, it is noted that learned counsel\n\nreferred to the Adhaar Card (Annexure P1) and LPG connection (Annexure P2)\n\nto submit that Suman Nath is a resident of Single Housing Board Colony,\n\nDhanas, Chandigarh and not Omaxe City, Mullanpur. Learned counsel submits\n\nthat though a flat at Omaxe City was purchased by the petitioner's husband but\n\nno one was residing there. The said premises were lying locked. Reference was\n\nalso made to the Income Tax Returns of Suman Nath's husband pertaining to the\n\nassessment years 2013-2014, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 wherein her husband's\n\naddress is mentioned that of Dhanas and not Mullanpur. The said documents\n\nhave not been denied.\n\nA perusal of the orders whereby bail applications of the petitioners\n\nManju, Mukesh and Suman Nath were dismissed, indicates that the factum of the\n\nproceedings initiated under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. were never brought to the notice\n\nof the learned court below. The said petitioners were admittedly availing the\n\n14 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-15-\n\nremedies available to them. It cannot be said that they were deliberately evading\n\nthe process of law, especially keeping in view the facts as discussed above. The\n\npetitioners Manju and Mukesh have joined investigation pursuant to order dated\n\n16.01.2017 passed by this Court in CRM No.M-980 of 2017. The petitioner -\n\nSuman Nath appeared before the concerned Area Magistrate pursuant to order\n\ndated 29.03.2017 passed in CRM No.M-5792 of 2017 and she has been admitted\n\nto interim bail on her appearance. It is further not in dispute that she has since\n\njoined investigation. Therefore in this situation, it cannot be said that the said\n\npetitioners are evading the process of law.\n\nThe petitioners - Manju, Mukesh and Suman Nath have admittedly\n\nsubmitted to the process of law, they have joined investigation, therefore no\n\nfurther orders are required to be passed in CRM No.M-4286 of 2017 and CRM\n\nNo.M-5792 of 2017 challenging order dated 16.01.2017 passed by the learned\n\nJudicial Magistrate First Class, Kharar declaring the petitioners - Manju,\n\nMukesh and Suman Nath to be proclaimed offenders. Both the petitions are\n\naccordingly disposed of.\n\nWithout delving in a detailed discussion of the facts, lest prejudice\n\nbe caused to either side, it is considered just and expedient in the facts and\n\ncircumstances to allow CRM No.M-980 of 2017 preferred by the petitioners -\n\nManju and Mukesh. Consequently, order dated 16.01.2017 passed in CRM\n\nNo.M-980 of 2017 is made absolute.\n\nCRM No.M-1218 of 2017 preferred by the petitioner - Suman Nath\n\nis disposed of with a direction that interim bail afforded to her by the concerned\n\nArea Magistrate pursuant to order dated 29.03.2017 passed by this Court in\n\n15 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-16-\n\nCRM No.M-5792 of 2017 be made absolute subject to her furnishing fresh bail\n\nbonds and surety to the satisfaction of the said learned Area Magistrate.\n\nHowever, in respect to the petitioner - Sarju Devi i.e., mother-in-law\n\nof the deceased, I do not find any ground to extend the benefit of anticipatory\n\nbail to her in the facts and circumstances of the case. The transfer of various\n\namounts of money in the account of the deceased by itself cannot be of any\n\nbenefit to her. It is not in dispute that the petitioner - Sarju Devi was admittedly\n\nreceiving treatment at PGI, Chandigarh and was present in Chandigarh at the\n\ntime of occurrence. Various raids were admittedly conducted at village Merta\n\n(Rajasthan). Statement of one of her sons was recorded. There is nothing on\n\nrecord to suggest that she was not on talking terms with her son. In fact, she is a\n\nresident of Rajasthan. It cannot be said that she was not aware of the\n\nproceedings under\nSection 82\nCr.P.C. against her. Petitioner - Sarju Devi has not\n\nsubmitted to the process of law. Finding no ground to grant the concession of\n\nanticipatory bail to the petitioner - Sarju Devi, CRM No.M-10793 of 2017\n\npreferred by Sarju Devi is dismissed.\n\nHowever, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case,\n\nCRM No.M-11396 of 2017 challenging order dated 16.01.2017 qua Sarju Devi is\n\ndisposed of with a direction that in case the petitioner - Sarju Devi surrenders\n\nbefore the court of competent jurisdiction on or before 01.11.2017, her\n\napplication for regular bail, if preferred, be decided expeditiously in accordance\n\nwith law, preferably within one week.\n\nIt is clarified that none of the observations made hereinabove shall\n\nbe construed to be a reflection on the merits of the case. The same are solely\n\n16 of 17\n\n::: Downloaded on - 24-10-2017 23:59:08 :::\n\nCRM No.M-980 of 2017 and connected cases\n\n-17-\n\nconfined for the purpose of decision of these petitions.\n\n( LISA GILL )\nOctober 23, 2017.
