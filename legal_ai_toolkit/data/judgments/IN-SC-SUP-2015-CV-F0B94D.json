The present controversy is yet another seniority dispute amongst\nemployees of the Customs and Central Excise Department. The controversy\nherein has emerged on account of a reconstitution of cadres. In the first\ninstance, a separate cadre was constituted, out of the existing ministerial\ncadre, for discharging electronic data processing responsibilities. This\nwas necessitated by the decision of the department to introduce\ncomputerization, in its functioning. The instant computerization project,\nwhich commenced in 1991-92, seems to have been fully implemented in or\naround 2002-03. Consequent upon achievement of the above objective, the\nseparate cadre so created, was sought to be re-amalgamated with the\nexisting ministerial cadre. The above noticed bifurcation and re-\namalgamation, resulted in a co-incidental career advancement, for those who\nhad accepted to break away from the original ministerial cadre. Some of\nthose who were originally placed at inferior positions in the seniority\nlist of the original ministerial cadre, acquired superiority over their\ncounterparts (in the original ministerial cadre), consequent upon their\npromotion within the cadre of data entry operators, which resulted in their\nacquiring a higher position in seniority, over and above those who were\nsenior to them in the original ministerial cadre. Before embarking upon\nthe niceties of the seniority dispute, it is imperative to delve upon the\nreasons of the afore-stated bifurcation, and re-amalgamation of cadres.\nThe instant aspect of the matter is accordingly being dealt with, in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n\n2. The ministerial cadre as it originally existed, comprised of posts of\nDeputy Office Superintendents (Levels 1 and 2), Upper Division Clerks,\nLower Division Clerks, Stenographers (Senior Grade and Ordinary Grade),\nDraftsmen etc. Conditions of service of members of the original\nministerial cadre, were regulated by the Central Excise and Land Customs\nDepartment Group 'C' Posts Recruitment Rules, 1979 (hereinafter referred to\nas, the 1979 Rules). Members of the original ministerial cadre regulated\nby the provisions of the 1979 Rules were eligible for promotion to the post\nof Inspector (Ordinary Scale) - an executive cadre post. And thereupon,\neven further promotion, in the executive cadre.\n\n3. Consequent upon the recommendations made by the Fourth Central Pay\nCommission in paragraph 11.45 of its report, the Government of India took\nupon itself the responsibility to examine the rationalization of pay scales\nfor posts responsible for discharging work relating to data entry. The\ntask sought to be undertaken was to prescribe uniform pay scales and\ndesignations for electronic data processing posts, in consultation with the\nDepartment of Personnel. Consequent upon the suggestions made by a\ncommittee set up by the Department of Electronics in November, 1986, the\nGovernment of India decided to introduce the following uniform pattern for\nElectronic Data Processing Posts:-\n\n|S.No. |Designation of post |Pay Scale | |\n| | Data Entry Operators | |\n|1. |Data Entry Operator |Rs.1150-1500 |This will be entry |\n| |Grade 'A' | |grade for higher |\n| | | |secondary with |\n| | | |knowledge of data |\n| | | |entry work |\n|2. |Data Entry Operator |Rs.1350-2200 |This will be entry |\n| |Grade 'B' | |grade for graduation |\n| | | |with knowledge of |\n| | | |data entry work or |\n| | | |promotional grade for|\n| | | |Data Entry Operator |\n| | | |Grade 'A' |\n|3. |Data Entry Operator |Rs.1400-2300 |Promotional Grade |\n| |Grade 'C' | | |\n|4. |Data Entry Operator |Rs.1600-2660 |Promotional Grade |\n| |Grade 'D' | | |\n|5. |Data Entry Operator |Rs.2000-3500 |Promotional Grade |\n| |Grade 'E' | | |\n| |Data Processing/Programming Staff |\n|1. |Data Processing Assistant|Rs.1600-2660 |Entry grade for |\n| |Grade 'A' | |graduates with |\n| | | |Diploma/Certificate |\n| | | |in Computer |\n| | | |Application |\n|2. |Data Processing Assistant|Rs.2000-3200 |Promotional Grade |\n| |Grade 'B' | | |\n|3. |Programmer |Rs.2375-3500 |Direct entry for |\n| | | |holders of degree in |\n| | | |Engineering or |\n| | | |post-graduation in |\n| | | |Science/Maths etc., |\n| | | |or post-graduation in|\n| | | |Computer Application |\n| | | |Or |\n| | | |By promotion from |\n| | | |Data Processing |\n| | | |Assistant Grade 'B' |\n|4. |Senior Programmer |Rs.3000-4500 |Promotional Grade |\n\nIn continuation of the aforesaid office memorandum dated 11.9.1989, the\nGovernment of India issued a further memorandum dated 8.1.1990, suggesting\njob descriptions for various levels of data entry operators and programming\nstaff, which could be adopted by different ministries/departments of the\nGovernment of India, with suitable modifications to meet their individual\nrequirements. The suggestions incorporated in the annexures appended to\nthe office memorandum dated 8.1.1990, revealed five categories of data\nentry operators, differentiated and distinguished as under:-\n\n\"1. Data Entry Operator-A: 1150-25-1500\n\nAll types of data preparation and validation including alpha-numeric data\nentry, graphic data entry, voice-entry, optical entry etc., and associated\nverification, and pre-programmed validation, text processing etc., on any\ntype of machines/equipment/instrument endowed with facilities for data\nentry and/or preparation for data entry and/or pre-programmed validation of\nentered data including key punching machine, key to magnetic media machine,\nkey to optical media machine, any type of computer/EDP equipment, any\ncomputer based equipment/computer based instrument/computer based online or\nreal time systems/computer network based systems.\n\n2. Data Entry Operator-B: 1350-30-1440-40-2200\n\nIn addition to those jobs mentioned for Data Entry Operator-A, Pooling,\nCounting, Collating, Coding, Console Operation, assisting in the\npreparation of Statistics, billing, input/output handling etc., on any type\nof machine/equipment/instrument endowed with facilities for data entry or\npreparation for data entry and/or validation of entered data as specified\nunder the description for Data Entry Operator-A.\n\n3. Data Entry Operator-C:\n\nIn addition to those jobs and machine equipment instrument mentioned for\nData Entry Operator-B, training of operators, scheduling of jobs and more\nskill-based validation of alpha-numeric or graphic data as determined by\nthe needs of the organization.\n\n4. Data Entry Operator-D:\n\nIn addition to those jobs mentioned for Data Entry Operator-C, programming\nrelating to data preparation and/or validation, and for a few staff who are\nconsidered to have the required aptitude and depending upon the need,\nsupervision of the work of Data Entry Operator-A, B and C.\n\n5. Data Entry Operator-E:\n\nSupervision of the work of data preparation, scheduling and distribution of\njobs among other Data Entry Operators, planning, scheduling, coordination\nand implementation of interrelated and integrated data preparation jobs,\nprogramming relating to data preparation and/or validation traction and if\nnecessary to do supporting job of data entry, verification, validation etc.\ndepending on exigencies of work.\"\n\n4. In order to implement the recommendations made by the Fourth Central\nPay Commission, the Central Board of Excise & Customs, Department of\nRevenue, Ministry of Finance, framed the Electronic Data Processing Posts\n(Group 'C' Technical Posts) Recruitment Rules, 1992 (hereinafter referred\nto as, the 1992 Rules). The aforesaid rules were framed by the President\nof India in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to\nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution of India. Rule 5 of the 1992 Rules provided, that all\npersons holding the ministerial posts of Key Punch Operators, Terminal\nOperators and Lower Division Clerks, who were performing the duties of\nTerminal Operators prior to the commencement of the 1992 Rules, would be\ndeemed to be appointed as Data Entry Operators Grade 'A'. Rule 5 of the\n1992 Rules further postulated, that all Data Entry Operators Grade 'A'\nappointed at the time of the commencement of the 1992 Rules, would rank en-\n\nblock senior to those appointed after the commencement of the Rules.\n\n5. Rule 7 of the 1992 Rules authorized, the Central Government to relax\nany other provision of the rules with respect to any class or category of\npersons. On 2.2.1993, in exercise of the powers conferred on the Central\nGovernment, the Central Excise Department permitted its erstwhile\nemployees, to apply for posts of Data Entry Operator Grade 'A', subject to\nthe condition, that they had completed 3 years' regular service and\nsatisfied the conditions of eligibility stipulated in the 1992 Rules. On\n9.9.1993, the Customs Department, issued a circular informing the employees\nwho had exercised their option for appointment to the post of Data Entry\nOperator Grade 'A', that their option was final and could not be revoked.\nA number of employees holding ministerial cadre posts in the Customs and\nCentral Excise Department, accordingly came to be appointed as Data Entry\nOperators Grade 'A'.\n\n6. Under the mandate of the 1992 Rules, the post of Data Entry Operator\nGrade 'A' was assigned the pay scale of Rs.1150-25-1500. It was the lowest\npost under the 1992 Rules. The Schedule appended to the 1992 Rules\nprovided, that to be eligible for appointment to the post of Data Entry\nOperator Grade 'A', an individual should have qualified the 12th standard\nor equivalent examination. Additionally, he/she should possess a speed of\nnot less than 8000 key depressions per hour, for data entry work. The\nonward promotion from the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'A' was to the\npost of Data Entry Operator Grade 'B'. The said promotional post was in\nthe pay scale of Rs.1350-30-1440-40-1800-EB-50-2200. To be eligible for\npromotion to the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'B', the schedule\nstipulated 6 years' regular service as Data Entry Operator Grade 'A'. The\npost of Data Entry Operator Grade 'B' was liable to be filled exclusively\nby promotion, failing which, on transfer by deputation. Onward promotion\nfrom the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'B', was to the post of Data\nEntry Operator Grade 'C'. The said promotional post, was in the pay scale\nof Rs.1400-40-1800-EB-50-2300. Data Entry Operators Grade 'B' with 3\nyears' regular service in the grade, were considered eligible for promotion\nto the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'C'. The schedule appended to the\n1992 Rules provided, that the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'C' would\nbe filled up exclusively by promotion, failing which, on transfer by\ndeputation. The highest post under the 1992 Rules, was the post of Data\nEntry Operator Grade 'D'. The said post was to be filled up by promotion\nfrom amongst Data Entry Operators Grade 'C', with 4 years' regular service\nin the grade. The post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'D', was earmarked the\npay scale of Rs.1600-50-2300-EB-60-2660. Just as in other cases referred\nto hereinabove, promotion to the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'D' was\nto be made exclusively by promotion, failing which, on transfer by\ndeputation.\n\n7. A perusal of the cadre of posts evolved under the 1992 Rules would\nreveal, that the Customs and Central Excise Department created a four-level\ncadre of Data Entry Operators, i.e. Grades 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'. This was\nin contradistinction to the five-level cadre of Data Entry Operators\nsuggested in the deliberations carried out by the Government of India (as\nalready noticed above). A perusal of the 1992 Rules further reveals, that\nthe cadre of Data Entry Operators, was separate from the original\nministerial cadre. Persons from the original ministerial cadre were not\neligible for promotion to the different levels of posts created under the\n1992 Rules. Likewise, members of different levels in the cadre of Data\nEntry Operators, were no longer eligible for onward promotion to any post\nof ministerial cadre. Most significantly, an incumbent holding a cadre\npost under the 1992 Rules was no longer eligible for promotion to the post\nof Inspector (Ordinary Scale) in the executive cadre. And therefore, not\neligible for any onward promotion in the executive cadre. Accordingly it\nis inevitable to conclude, that after the promulgation of the 1992 Rules,\nthe Customs and Central Excise Department comprised of a separate and\ndistinct ministerial cadre, as also, a separate and distinct cadre of Data\nEntry Operators.\n\n8. The factual position depicted in the pleadings filed before this\nCourt reveals, that throughout India only 211, 52 and 17 employees got\npromoted to the posts of Data Entry Operator Grade 'B', Grade 'C' and Grade\n'D' respectively, under the 1992 Rules. The remaining individuals inducted\ninto the cadre of Data Entry Operators from the original ministerial cadre,\nhave continued to occupy the post of Data Entry Operator Grade 'A', even\nafter having rendered services for more than 10-15 years i.e., without\nobtaining a single promotion. As against the aforesaid career progression\nunder the 1992 Rules, the administration found that the ministerial cadre\nemployees holding the posts of Lower Division Clerk, Upper Division Clerk,\nand erstwhile Tax Assistant etc. were promoted (during the same period of\nservice) to the post of Inspector (Ordinary Scale), and even further up to\nthe post of Commissioner on the executive side, and up to the post of Chief\nAccounts Officer on the ministerial side, on account of better promotion\navenues available to the ministerial cadre. In order to resolve the\ndistinction in the two cadres of employees, the Central Board of Excise &\nCustoms invited suggestions from all the Commisionerates for the re-merger\nof cadres. The matter was examined also in the light of the fact that the\npurpose for which the cadre of Data Entry Operators was created, had been\nachieved. The deliberations lead to restructure/re-amalgamation, by\nabolishing the cadre of Data Entry Operators. To give effect to the\nexecutive determination the President of India, in exercise of the powers\nconferred on him by the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of\nIndia, framed two sets of rules for the Customs and Excise Department,\nnamely, the Central Excise and Customs Department Tax Assistant (Group 'C'\nPost) Recruitment Rules, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as, the TA Rules,\n2003) and the Central Excise and Customs Department Senior Tax Assistant\n(Group 'C' Post) Recruitment Rules, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as, the\nSTA Rules, 2003). In order to understand the re-merger/re-amalgamation of\nthe cadres in the Customs and Excise Department, it is imperative for us to\ndelve upon the effect of the TA Rules, 2003, as also, the STA Rules, 2003.\nWe shall examine the aforementioned two sets of rules, in the following\nparagraphs.\n\n9. The TA Rules, 2003 provided for the initial constitution of the cadre\nof Tax Assistants, through Rule 4 thereof. Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 is\nbeing extracted hereunder:-\n\n\"4. Initial Constitution.- (1) The person appointed on regular basis and\nholding the post of Upper Division Clerk and Data Entry Operator Grade A on\nthe commencement of these rules shall deemed to have been appointed as Tax\nAssistant under these rules and the service rendered by such persons in the\nrespective posts before commencement of these rules shall be taken into\naccount as regular service rendered on the post of Tax Assistant for the\npurpose of promotion etc.\n\n(2) The person holding the post of Data Entry Operator Grade-A appointed\nunder these rules as Tax Assistant shall, within two years from the date of\nsuch appointment as Tax Assistant, pass the Departmental Examination as\nconducted by the competent authority, failing which he shall not be\nentitled to get any further increment.\n\n(3) Any person, who holds a post of Lower Division Clerk on regular basis\nand falls within the seniority list as determined by the appointing\nauthority at the commencement of these rules shall, on passing the\nDepartmental Computer Proficiency examination conducted by the appointing\nauthority, be deemed to have been promoted with effect from the date of\npassing such examination on the post of Tax Assistant.\n\n(4) The Upper Division Clerks and Data Entry Operators Grade-A shall be\nplaced en-block senior and, their inter se placement shall be fixed in\naccordance with the date of regular appointment to the respective grade\nsubject to the condition that their inter se placement in respective grade\nshall not be disturbed.\n\n(5) Lower Division Clerks shall be placed below Upper Division Clerks and\nData Entry Operator Grade-A.\"\n\nA perusal of Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 reveals, that persons holding the\nposts of Upper Division Clerk and Data Entry Operator Grade 'A' would be re-\ndesignated as Tax Assistants. The service rendered by them as Upper\nDivision Clerk and Data Entry Operator Grade 'A' respectively, would be\ntaken into consideration as regular service rendered on the post of Tax\nAssistant (for purposes of promotion etc.). In addition to the above,\nLower Division Clerks falling within the seniority list, as determined by\nthe appointing authority at the commencement of the TA Rules, 2003, on\npassing the departmental computer proficiency examination, would be deemed\nto be promoted as Tax Assistants (from the date of passing such\nexamination). Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 expressly postulates, that\nUpper Division Clerks and Data Entry Operators Grade 'A', would be placed\nen-block senior to others appointed as Tax Assistants, and further, that\ntheir inter-se seniority would be determined from the date of their regular\nappointment to the respective grade. For their inter-se placement, Rule 4\nof the TA Rules, 2003 further postulated, that Lower Division Clerks would\nbe placed below the Upper Division Clerks and Data Entry Operators Grade\n'A'. A perusal of Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 reveals an amalgamation of\nthree posts, namely, Upper Division Clerk, Data Entry Operator Grade 'A'\nand Lower Division Clerk. All these posts were amalgamated into a freshly\ncreated cadre of Tax Assistants under the TA Rules, 2003.\n\n10. While deliberating on the TA Rules, 2003, it is also imperative to\nnotice, that Rule 5 of the TA Rules, 2003 provided for the methods of\nrecruitment, age limits and other qualifications, for appointment to the\npost of Tax Assistant. The details of the aforesaid particulars are found\nin the schedule appended to the TA Rules, 2003. A perusal of the above\nschedule reveals, that 90% of the appointments made to the post of Tax\nAssistant were to be by direct recruitment, and 10% by way of promotion.\nFor promotion, the following conditions of eligibility were stipulated in\ncolumn 12 of the schedule appended to the TA Rules, 2003:-\n\n\"From amongst the Lower Division Clerks and Head Havaldars who have\nrendered seven years of service in the Grade on regular basis and possess\nthe following qualifications, namely:-\n\n(a) Matriculation or equivalent qualification from a recognized\ninstitution, and\n\n(b) Data Entry Speed of 5000 key depression per hour and passed the\nDepartmental examination with knowledge of typing in Hindi or English at a\nspeed of 25 wpm and 30 wpm respectively.\"\n\nIt is apparent from the perusal of Rule 5, coupled with the schedule\nappended to TA Rules, 2003, that the initial merger of the ministerial\ncadre and the cadre of Data Entry Operators was made, against the post of\nTax Assistants. In sum and substance, therefore, irrespective of the post\n(in ministerial or Data Entry Operators' cadre) occupied, the lowest level\nof amalgamation was, against the post of Tax Assistant.\n\n11. Insofar as the STA Rules, 2003 are concerned, the initial\nconstitution therein was postulated in Rule 5 thereof. Rule 5\naforementioned is being extracted hereunder:-\n\n\"5. Initial Constitution.- (i) All the persons appointed on the regular\nbasis at the time of commencement of these rules to the Grade of Assistant,\nTax Assistant, Upper Division Clerk (Special Pay), Data Entry Operator\nGrade 'B' and 'C' shall be deemed to have been appointed as Senior Tax\nAssistants under these rules. The service rendered by them before\ncommencement of these rules shall be taken into account for deciding the\neligibility for promotion to the next higher grade.\n\n(ii) Assistants (Rs.5000-8000) and Data Entry Operator Grade 'C' (Rs.5000-\n8000) are being redesignated as Senior Tax Assistants in the same scale of\npay. Therefore, the Assistants and Data Entry Operator Grade 'C' shall be\nplaced enblock senior to the other categories. However their inter-se-\n\nplacement shall be done according to the date from which they had actually\nbeen appointed to these grades on regular basis subject to the condition\nthat their inter-se placement in their respective category shall not be\naltered.\n\n(iii) The Data Entry Operator Grade 'B' (4500-7000) and Tax Assistants\n(4500-7000) have been placed in their higher scale of 5000-8000 and they\nshall be placed below the Assistant and Data Entry Operator Grade 'C' and\ntheir inter-se placement shall be fixed in accordance with the date of\nregular appointment to the respective grade subject to the condition that\ntheir inter-se placement in respective category shall not be disturbed.\n\n(iv) Upper Division Clerk with special pay shall be placed below\nAssistant; Data Entry Operator Grade 'C', Data Entry Operator Grade 'B',\nTax Assistants.\n\n(v) The present employees would be required to pass the required or\nsuitable departmental examination, as specified by the Competent Authority,\nfrom time to time, in Computer application and relevant procedures within\ntwo years failing which they would not be eligible for further increments.\"\n\nA perusal of Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003 reveals, that at the initial\nconstitution of the cadre the posts of Assistant, Tax Assistant, Upper\nDivision Clerk (Special Pay) and Data Entry Operator Grades 'B' and 'C'\nwere merged as Senior Tax Assistants. The aforesaid merger contemplated\nthe merger of posts belonging to the ministerial cadre, and posts belonging\nto the cadre of Data Entry Operator. Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003 also\nexpressly provided for the manner in which the above merged posts would be\nranked in the integrated cadre of Senior Tax Assistants. The inter-se\nranking was provided for as under:-\n\n(i) Assistants and Data Entry Operators Grade 'C' were placed above all\nother posts which constituted the cadre of Senior Tax Assistants, on the\npromulgation of the STA Rules, 2003. This was purportedly sought to be\ndone, as is evident from Rule 5(ii) of the STA Rules, 2003, because the\nposts of Assistant and Data Entry Operator Grade 'C' were in the pay scale\nof Rs.5000-8000, and thereby, were enjoying the highest scale amongst the\nposts merged, to constitute the cadre of Senior Tax Assistants. In order\nto regulate the inter-se seniority between the merged posts of Assistants\nand Data Entry Operators Grade 'C', Rule 5(ii) of the STA Rules, 2003\nfurther provided, that the inter-se placement of persons holding such\nposts, would be based on the date on which such persons had been actually\nappointed in the pay scale of Rs.5000-8000, on regular basis.\n\n(ii) In the same fashion as Assistants and Data Entry Operators Grade 'C',\nRule 5(iii) of the STA Rules, 2003 provided, that Data Entry Operators\nGrade 'B' and Tax Assistants, who were earlier placed in the pay scale of\nRs.4500-7000, and thereafter placed in the higher scale of Rs.5000-8000,\nwould be placed en-block below Assistants and Data Entry Operators Grade\n'C'. In other words, the posts of Data Entry Operators Grade 'B' and Tax\nAssistants which had an inferior position adjudged on the basis of pay\nscales, vis--vis Data Entry Operators Grade 'C' and Assistants, prior to\nthe promulgation of the STA Rules, 2003, were placed en-masse below Data\nEntry Operators Grade 'C' and Assistants, so as to preserve the said\ninferior position in the cadre of Senior Tax Assistants. Insofar as the\ninter-se placement between the Data Entry Operators Grade 'B' and Tax\nAssistants is concerned, Rule 5(iii) of the STA Rules, 2003 provided, that\nthe date of their regular appointment in their respective grades, would\ndetermine their inter-se seniority in the cadre of Senior Tax Assistants.\n\n(iii) For exactly the same reasons as have been indicated in (i) and (ii)\nabove, namely, the pay scale in which the respective posts were placed\nprior to the creation of the cadre of Senior Tax Assistants under the STA\nRules, 2003, the posts of Upper Division Clerk were placed at the bottom of\nthe cadre of Senior Tax Assistants, at the initial constitution of the said\ncadre, under the mandate of Rule 5(iv) of the STA Rules, 2003.\n\n12. It is imperative to point out here, that the erstwhile ministerial\ncadre was primarily engaged in discharging duties of a procedural nature,\nwhereas those engaged in the cadre of Data Entry Operators were considered\nto be primarily engaged in discharging duties in the field of computer\napplications. It is, therefore, that Rule 5(v) of the STA Rules, 2003\nprovided, that all employees appointed as Senior Tax Assistants, at the\ninitial constitution of the aforesaid cadre, under the STA Rules, 2003,\nwould be required to pass departmental examinations, so as to achieve the\nproficiency required in discharging duties relating to the application of\nrelevant procedures, as also, with reference to computer applications.\n\n13. It is in the background of the aforesaid factual and legal position,\nthat we would venture to adjudicate upon the controversy raised in these\nconnected civil appeals.\n\n14. It is relevant to mention, that in the first instance, a challenge to\nthe rules referred to hereinabove, was raised at the hands of the erstwhile\nmembers of the ministerial cadre, namely, those members of the original\nministerial cadre, who had not opted for appointment/absorption into the\ncadre of Data Entry Operators. In their challenge raised before the\nCentral Administrative Tribunal, Madras Bench, Chennai (hereinafter\nreferred to as, the Administrative Tribunal), a common order dated\n30.12.2003 was passed, while disposing of Original Application nos. 558,\n538 and 909 of 2003, and a common order dated 30.4.2004 was passed while\ndisposing of Original Application nos. 462 and 639 of 2003. Another order\ndated 24.6.2004 was passed, while disposing of Original Application no.\n1025 of 2003. And likewise, an order dated 2.8.2004 was passed, while\ndisposing of Original Application no. 1150 of 2003.\nAnd finally, an order\ndated 14.10.2004 was passed while disposing of Original Application no. 71\nof 2004. It would be relevant to mention, that the solitary contention\nraised at the hands of the erstwhile members of the ministerial cadre (who\nhad not opted for the appointment/absorption into the cadre of Data Entry\nOperators) was, that the process of bifurcation of cadres followed by the\nre-amalgamation thereof, had adversely affected their seniority.\nAccordingly, the erstwhile members of the ministerial cadre, claimed\nrestoration of the position of their seniority as it originally existed,\nwith reference to such other members of the ministerial cadre who had opted\nfor absorption into cadre of Data Entry Operators, and who had thereafter,\nas a matter of re-amalgamation (under the provisions of the TA Rules, 2003\nand the STA Rules, 2003) been appointed as Tax Assistants and Senior Tax\nAssistants respectively. The instant claim raised by the erstwhile members\nof the ministerial cadre, came to be accepted by the Administrative\nTribunal vide orders dated 30.12.2003, 30.4.2004, 26.4.2004, 2.8.2004 and\n14.10.2004, on the basis of the law laid down by this Court in\nOm Prakash\nSharma v. Union of India\n, 1985 (Supp.) SCC 218.\n\n15. The orders passed by the Administrative Tribunal referred to in the\nforegoing paragraph were assailed through Writ Petition Nos. 8361, 8388,\n17208, 17257, 21692 to 21694, 29468, 34708, 38622 of 2004 and Writ Petition\nNos. 2723, 3302 and 8606 of 2005. They were also assailed through Writ\nPetition MP Nos. 9866, 20444, 20497, 26220, 26221, 35789, 35791, 41879,\n46155 of 2004; 12236 and 9286 of 2005; 17258 and 17508 of 2006; and WPMP\nNo. 864 of 2004. The instant challenge was raised at the hands of the\nUnion of India, as also, the members of the cadre of Data Entry Operators,\nwho were merged into the cadre of Tax Assistants and Senior Tax Assistants,\nconsequent upon the promulgation of the TA Rules, 2003 and STA Rules, 2003.\nAll the above mentioned writ petitions were disposed of by the High Court\nof Judicature at Madras (hereinafter referred to as, the High Court) by a\ncommon judgment and order dated 13.4.2007. While adjudicating upon the\naforesaid controversy, the High Court, in paragraph 24 of the impugned\njudgment and order dated 13.4.2007, framed the questions arising for\ndetermination. Paragraph 24 is being extracted hereunder:-\n\n\"24. The contesting respondents have not challenged the entire rules\nrelating to the restructure of the cadres and the merger/integration of\nministerial cadre and technical cadre before the Tribunal. It is only the\nrules relating to the fixation of inter se placement of the erstwhile\nministerial cadre staff and the erstwhile technical cadre staff in the\nrestructured cadre which are challenged before the Tribunal. The\ncontesting respondents, who are presently working as Preventive Officers on\nad hoc basis, claim that for determining the inter se placement of the\nministerial cadre staff and the technical cadre staff in the restructured\ncadre, the date of initial appointment in the services of the Central\nExcise and Customs Departments should be taken into consideration. On the\nother hand, the writ petitioners claim that the fixation of inter se\nseniority should be on the basis of the date of regular appointment in the\nrespective grades, but subject to the condition that inter-se placement in\nthe respective category, is legal and reasonable.\"\n\nIt is, therefore apparent, that the issue agitated before the High Court\nwas the same as had been agitated before the Administrative Tribunal.\nWhile adjudicating upon the propositions canvassed before it, the High\nCourt in paragraph 35 of the impugned judgment and order, observed as\nunder:-\n\n\"35. We have no quarrel with the proposition of law enunciated by the Apex\nCourt. But, in the cases on hand, all the parties emerge from the same\ncadre of LDC and only by virtue of option, some parties have opted to the\npost of Data Entry Operators and by virtue of the impugned Rules they were\nafforded fortuitous advantage that too without any stringent conditions\nlike passing the Departmental Tests like the case of a LDC who is required\nto pass the same to seek promotion to the next category of UDC, while the\nrest of the LDCs. who have not opted for the post of Data Entry Operators\nand were stick on to the much higher responsible position, were put in a\nmost disadvantageous position. The inter se seniority has been fixed by the\nimpugned Rules only based on the pay and giving a go-bye to all the norms\nprescribed by the Apex Court. Since the impugned legislation suffers from\nthe vice of discrimination and unreasonableness, we hold that the impugned\nRules are arbitrary and violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution, since they give unreasonable advantage and a steep\nforward for an otherwise low category persons like Data Entry Operators as\nagainst the LDCs/UDCs/Tax Assistants, who perform highly responsible and\ncomplex duties unlike mere entering a data by the Data Entry Operators.\"\n\nThereupon, the High Court considered the controversy in the following\nperspective:-\n\n\"38. It was shown, by instances, by the learned senior counsel for the\nrespondents that while in a short span of time, that too, without any\ncondition like passing out any Departmental Test, the Data Entry Operators\nmoved from one Grade to other with higher pay structure, the LDCs, who have\nnot opted for the post of Data Entry Operator, have remained and stagnated\nas LDCs. itself and because of the impugned Rules, the position has further\nworsened, since it blocked their further promotional avenues, by placing\npersons like Data Entry Operators, who have already enjoyed the fruits of\npromotion more than once, over and above LDCs/UDCs/Tax Assistants in the\ninter se seniority list. It is to be mentioned that promotion is an\nincidence of service.\n\nxxx xxx xxx xxx\n\n43. A forcible argument was advanced on the part of the respondents\ndemonstrating how by virtue of the impugned Rules, the LDCs, who have not\nopted to be posted as Data Entry Operators were severely prejudiced and how\nthe restructured cadres have paved way for the junior DEOs to have a march\nover the other senior employees of the erstwhile ministerial cadre and get\nfortuitous advantage. It has also been demonstrated by materials how the\nimpugned Rules are working hard against the senior eligible candidates\nwithout any promotional avenue, since being blocked by the far junior Data\nEntry Operators. Though, as held by the Apex Court, seniority is not a\nfundamental right, the State should have created promotional avenues for\nthe respondents having regard to its constitutional obligations adumbrated\nin\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n44. Therefore, the official respondents would not be justified in\nblocking the promotional avenues of the respondents/UDCs or Tax Assistants,\nas the case may be, without framing proper rules and framing faulty and\narbitrary Rules like the ones in dispute. Promotion, as held by the Apex\nCourt is a condition and incidence of service and as held by the Apex Court\nin the above Judgement, even there is an obligation on the part of the\nState under\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution to create promotional\navenues for the employees and any Rule or procedure, which goes against the\nabove dictum, could well be termed as an arbitrary exercise of power and\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n45. The impugned Rules put LDCs/UDCs/Special Pay UDCs/Tax Assistants in a\nmost disadvantageous position than their far juniors of Data Entry\nOperators, even though the nature of duties and powers exercised by them\nwhile holding the post of LDCs/UDCs/Special Pay UDCs/Tax Assistants not\nonly carry a complex nature of duties but also high responsibilities, which\nwould increase manifold by promotion from LDC to UDC/Special Pay UDC and\nfrom UDC/Special Pay UDC to Tax Assistant. Therefore, we have no hesitation\nto hold that the impugned Rules are violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution and are liable to be quashed.\"\n\nThe above consideration reveals, that the co-incidental prejudice suffered\nby the erstwhile members of the ministerial cadre, consequent upon the\nmerger of cadres constituted the foundational basis, of the determination.\nTheir lost chances of promotion, and the prejudice suffered by them on the\nsubject of seniority, on account of deprivation of the chances of\npromotion, remained uppermost in the mind of the High Court, while\nrecording its final conclusion in paragraph 46 as under:-\n\n\"46. We have given our anxious consideration to all the aspects of the\ncase put forth by both sides and found that the Tribunal has analyzed the\ncase in a proper perspective and having regard to the guidelines issued by\nthe Apex Court regarding fixation of inter se seniority in such cases and\nhas arrived at an unerring conclusion to hold that the seniority principle\nstipulated in the impugned notifications is unfair to the ministerial cadre\nof the Department and considering any other date than the date of initial\nappointment is discriminatory and arbitrary. We are unable to find any\nillegality or irregularity or perversity in approach in the well considered\nand merited decision arrived at by the Tribunal. Therefore, we see no merit\nin the contentions raised by the petitioners/Data Entry Operators and the\nsame deserve to be rejected.\"\n\n16. The challenge to the impugned orders passed by the Administrative\nTribunal, and affirmed by the High Court, will need an evaluation at our\nhands, in the background of the consideration applied in the adjudication\nof the controversy. We shall, at the first instance, venture to determine\nwhether the propositions applied for the determination of the controversy\nby the Administrative Tribunal and by the High Court, were in consonance\nwith the law declared by this Court.\n\n17. It would be relevant to mention, that the disputed issue of\nseniority, came to be determined in the impugned orders, by placing\nreliance on\nOm Prakash Sharma\n's case (supra). To understand the\ncontroversy settled by this Court in the aforementioned judgment, it is\nessential to extract the conclusions drawn therein. The same are\naccordingly being extracted hereunder:-\n\n\"2. Department styled as workshop mentioned at Serial No. 2 above was\nmerged with the department office of the Chief Electrical Engineer, Bombay.\nThis merger continued till July 31, 1979. Effective from August 1, 1979,\nall the three original departments trifurcated on August 31, 1956 were re-\namalgamated in the matter of staff and a common seniority list was\nintroduced in respect of all the four cadres which were prior to September\n1956 on a common seniority list. Pursuant to the amalgamation common\nseniority list (Annexure 6) was drawn up. It purports to be the combined\nseniority list of the Railway Administration, Electrical Department,\nCentral Railway, Jhansi. Validity of the seniority list is impugned in this\nappeal. In this seniority list Appellant 1 is at Serial No. 3, Appellant 2\nis at Serial No. 4, and Appellant 3 is at Serial No. 10. The department has\nassigned seniority to Respondents 3-6, in the same seniority list at Serial\nNos. 2, 5, 6 and 9 respectively in the cadre of head clerks. The appellants\ncontend that when the three departments had a common seniority list, the\nappellants were senior to Respondents 3 to 6, but after trifurcation and re-\namalgamation Respondents 3 to 6 who belonged to erstwhile workshop staff\nand who were amalgamated with the staff of the Chief Electrical Engineer,\nBombay, obtained accelerated promotion because of easy availability of\nvacancies. Consequently, when re-amalgamation was introduced from August 1,\n1979 when Respondents 3 to 6 reverted to the common seniority list with\nappellants and other similarly situated persons, they scored a march over\nthe appellants because of a fortuitous event. The contention in terms is\nthat where staff employed in different units under the administrative\ncontrol of one higher officer are borne on a common seniority list, when\nbecause of trifurcation re-amalgamation all are brought back on the common\nseniority list, their position ante must be reflected in the seniority\nlist. Original seniority it is said must prevail otherwise any other view\nwould be denial of equality of opportunity in the matter of public\nemployment guaranteed under\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution. Accordingly the\nappellants challenged the seniority list in Writ Petition 1415 of 1983 in\nthe High Court of Judicature at Allahabad. A Division Bench of the High\nCourt by a short cryptic order rejected the writ petition observing that\nthe Court did not find any merit in the writ petition. Hence this appeal by\nspecial leave.\n\n3. The appellants have an iron-clad case. The facts, not disputed,\n[pic]to summarise briefly are that under the Divisional Electrical Engineer\nthere were three separate departments under his administrative control.\nMembers of the staff of the three departments were borne on a common\nseniority list. In other words they were deemed to belong to one office in\nthe matter of seniority and promotion. This is not only not disputed but\nthe averment to that effect in para 6 of the petition has been admitted in\nthe counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the Railway Administration. It is\nagain admitted that the three appellants since their entry into service\nwere senior to Respondents 3 to 6. For the administrative convenience the\nRailway Administration trifurcated the cadres. In other words, three units\nwere separated from each other which resulted in each unit having its own\nseniority list and the common seniority list became irrelevant from the\ndate of the trifurcation. The Unit No. 2 called the workshop was\namalgamated with the office of the Chief Electrical Engineer, Bombay. That\nis not controverted. Respondents 3 to 6 belonged to the administrative\nstaff in the department styled as the workshop. The result of the\ntrifurcation and amalgamation of the workshop with the Bombay office was\nthat the workshop staff including Respondents 3 to 6 were taken over on the\nseniority list maintained by the Bombay office. It is admitted that on\naccount of availability of vacancies in the Bombay office Respondents 3 to\n6 got some accelerated promotions in the cadre of head clerks. Surprisingly\nafter a span of 23 years, Railway Administration reconsidered its earlier\ndecision and detached the workshop staff from the office of the Chief\nElectrical Engineer, Bombay and brought it back to Jhansi and three former\ndepartments under Divisional Electrical Engineer were amalgamated. In other\nwords situation ante as on August 31, 1956 was restored, and members of the\nstaff were brought on common seniority list cadre-wise. This factual\naverment is unambiguously admitted. Consequent upon amalgamation in 1979 a\nfresh common seniority list was drawn up in which cadre-wise Respondent 3\nwas shown senior to Appellants 1 and 2 and Respondents 5, 6 and 9 were\nshown senior to Appellant 3. Obviously when the amalgamation took place,\nRespondents 3 to 6 could not score a march over erstwhile seniors on any\nvalid principle of seniority. This would unquestionably be denial of\nequality under\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution. It may be that they might\nhave enjoyed some accelerated promotion when workshop staff was amalgamated\nwith the Bombay office. But when they were repatriated and re-amalgamated\nwith original two offices and brought back on the common seniority list,\nthey must find their original place qua the appellants. This is not a case\nwhere appellants were passed over at the time of selection or denied\npromotion on the ground of unsuitability. In such a situation status quo\nante has to be restored. Obviously Respondents 3 to 6 will be below the\nappellants and any other view to the contrary would be violative [pic]of\n\nArticle 16\nas it would constitute denial of equality in the matter of\npromotion. Therefore, the seniority list drawn up on a principle contrary\nto what is discussed herein would be bad in law and deserves to be\nquashed.\"\n\nA perusal of the above judgment reveals, that there were three independent\ndivisions, under a singular control, namely, (1) Divisional Electrical\nEngineers, Jhansi, (2) Office of the Assistant Electrical Engineers\n(Workshop), Jhansi, and (3) Office of the Assistant Electrical Engineer,\nJabalpur. These three divisions had separate offices. The clerical staff\nof the said departments, namely, clerks, senior clerks, head clerks and\nchief clerks, were borne on a common seniority list till 31.8.1956. From\n1.9.1956 onwards, these three divisions/departments, earlier under the\nsingular control of the Divisional Electrical Engineer, Jhansi, were\nseparated from each other (consequent upon the introduction of\ndivisionalization, in the railways). These three divisions, therefore,\nbecame three independent departments. The clerical staff of the three\nseparated departments, came to be placed in independent seniority lists.\nThe aforesaid process came to be reversed, and the earlier trifurcation,\nwas undone by re-amalgamation, which resulted in the restoration of status\nquo ante, as it prevailed up to 31.8.1956. In the background of the\nfoundational facts narrated hereinabove, this Court concluded that the\nprocess of trifurcation, followed by the process of re-amalgamation,\nrestoring the status quo ante, could not result in some of the members of\nthe erstwhile common cadre in scoring a march with reference to seniority,\nover others who were earlier senior to them. We shall first endeavour to\ndetermine whether the legal position declared by this Court in\nOm Prakash\nSharma\n's case (supra) could have been applied to the present controversy.\n\n18. The factual position in\nOm Prakash Sharma\n's case (supra) reveals,\nthat the employees whose inter-se seniority dispute arose for\nconsideration, were holding the position of clerks, senior clerks, head\nclerks and chief clerks in three divisions under the control of the\nDivisional Electrical Engineer, Jhansi. The said three divisions were made\nindependent departments, and the employees working in each of the\ndepartments whilst continuing as clerks, senior clerks, head clerks and\nchief clerks, were placed in different seniority lists. All the above\nposts in the three departments were re-amalgamated. Consequent upon re-\namalgamation, a common seniority list came to be framed for clerks, senior\nclerks, head clerks and chief clerks. It is in the above circumstances,\nthat this Court concluded, that the process of trifurcation, and subsequent\nre-amalgamation, would result in denial of equality, if persons who were\njunior prior to 31.8.1956, were assigned positions of seniority above to\nthose who were senior to them prior to the trifurcation. And that, such an\naction would result in denial of equality, provided for under\nArticle 16\nof\nthe Constitution of India. It was, therefore concluded, that consequent\nupon the re-amalgamation, resulting in the employees being brought back in\nthe common seniority list, they must be arrayed in the seniority list, in\nthe same manner as they were positioned prior to the trifurcation.\n\n19. Insofar as the present controversy is concerned, it is apparent from\nthe factual narration recorded hereinabove, that the ministerial cadre as\nit originally existed, comprised of posts of Deputy Office Superintendent\n(Levels 1 and 2), Upper Division Clerk, Lower Division Clerk, Stenographer\n(Senior Grade and Ordinary Grade), Draftsman etc. Consequent upon\npromulgation of the Electronic Data Processing Posts (Group 'C' Technical\nPosts) Recruitment Rules, 1992, a separate cadre of Data Entry Operators\ncame to be created. Appointment thereto, at the time of initial\nconstitution of the cadre of Data Entry Operators, was made out of the\noriginal ministerial cadre. The posts under the 1992 Rules, had a\ndifferent nomenclature, vis--vis the posts in the ministerial cadre.\nTheir duties and responsibilities were separate and distinct, from that of\nthe ministerial cadre. So were their avenues of promotion. The lowest\npost in the cadre of Data Entry Operators was designated as Data Entry\nOperator Grade 'A'.\nOnward promotion was to the post of Data Entry\nOperator Grade 'B', and thereafter, to Data Entry Operator Grade 'C', and\nfinally, to Data Entry Operator Grade 'D'. In the above view of the\nmatter, it is not possible for us to accept, that the creation of the cadre\nof Data Entry Operators, can be described as a mere bifurcation of the\noriginal cadre. A bifurcation simpliciter would envisage a division of the\nsame posts, as they originally existed, in two separate units. The\ncontroversy adjudicated upon in\nOm Prakash Sharma\n's case (supra) is\nillustrative of a simpliciter bifurcation (actually trifurcation), where\nthe cadre posts remained the same, but there was a vertical division,\nwhereby the said posts were re-constituted as two (actually three) separate\ncadres. Thereafter, the cadres were re-amalgamated, so as to restore the\nearlier position. In the present controversy, it is not possible to\nconclude, that the original position was ever restored. Consequent upon\nthe promulgation of the TA Rules, 2003 and the STA Rules, 2003, the\namalgamation resulted in appointments to the cadres of Tax Assistants and\nSenior Tax Assistants. Neither of the parties concerned, held either of\nthese posts prior to the promulgation of the abovementioned rules.\n\nIt is,\ntherefore, that we must conclude, that the judgment rendered in\nOm Prakash\nSharma\n's case (supra) was incorrectly applied, while adjudicating upon the\npresent controversy.\n\n20. It is also not possible for us to accept, that the promulgation of\nthe TA Rules, 2003 and the STA Rules, 2003 can be termed as a process of re-\namalgamation of the erstwhile cadre. Consequent upon the promulgation of\nthe above rules, posts from the ministerial cadre (regulated by the Central\nExcise and Land Customs Department Group 'C' Posts Recruitment Rules,\n1979), and the posts under the cadre of Data Entry Operators (regulated by\nthe Electronic Data Processing Posts (Group 'C' Technical Posts)\nRecruitment Rules, 1992), came to be merged into independent cadres of Tax\nAssistants and Senior Tax Assistants. What was contemplated under the TA\nrules, 2003 and the STA Rules, 2003, was an amalgamation of posts from two\nseparate cadres. This certainly did not result in restoration of the\nstatus quo ante, as it existed prior to the promulgation of the 1992 Rules.\nThe position here is of amalgamation, and not re-amalgamation as is in\nOm\nPrakash Sharma\n's case (supra). Members of the two separate cadres, which\nwere sought to be amalgamated, were required at the time of initial\nconstitution of the cadres, to qualify the departmental examination, and\nalternatively the departmental computer proficiency examination, under\nRules 4(2) and 4(3) of the TA Rules, 2003 and under Rule 5(v) of the STA\nRules, 2003. The above departmental examinations would render them\nsuitable to discharge the duties of the posts of Tax Assistants and Senior\nTax Assistants respectively. It is therefore apparent, that on the\namalgamation of the pre-existing cadres, they would be required to\ndischarge additional duties of a different nature, for which their\nproficiency was being ensured through the prescribed departmental\nexaminations. It is, therefore, not possible for us to conclude, that the\nTA Rules, 2003 and the STA Rules, 2003 had the effect of re-amalgamation of\nthe ministerial cadre and the cadre of Data Entry Operators, so as to\nrestore the position which existed, before the creation of the cadre of\nDate Entry Operators.\n\n21. At the cost of repetition we wish to reiterate, that the factual\nscenario which emerges for determination in the present controversy, is not\nakin to that which had arisen for consideration before this Court in\nOm\nPrakash Sharma\n's case (supra). Therein, the original cadre which comprised\nof the posts of clerks, senior clerks, head clerks and chief clerk, was\ntrifurcated and then re-amalgamated. The re-amalgamated cadre also\ncomprised of posts of clerks, senior clerks, head clerks and chief clerks.\nThe conclusions drawn in the above judgment, therefore, cannot be\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n\nWe are\nsatisfied in concluding, that the Courts below clearly erred in disposing\nof/determining the controversy in hand by applying the law declared by this\nCourt in\nOm Prakash Sharma\n's case (supra).\n\n22. We shall now venture to deal with another aspect of the matter,\nemerging out of the impugned order passed by the High Court. The\nconclusions drawn by the High Court, as have been recorded in paragraph 46\nof the impugned judgment and order dated 13.4.2007, emerged out of a\nconsideration which was noticed in paragraphs 38 to 45. Paragraphs 38 and\n43 to 46 of the impugned judgment and order, have already been extracted\nhereinabove. A perusal of the above consideration reveals, that the High\nCourt was swayed by the co-incidental prejudice suffered by the erstwhile\nmembers of the ministerial cadre, resulting in lost chances of promotion.\nThe aforesaid consideration could have been justified only if chances of\npromotion are treated as conditions of service. Insofar as the instant\naspect of the matter is concerned, this Court has repeatedly examined the\nissue whether chances of promotion constitute conditions of service. In\nthis behalf, reference may be made to a few judgments rendered by this\nCourt:\n\n(i) First of all, we may advert to the decision rendered by this Court in\n\nState of Maharashtra & Anr. v. Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni & Ors.\n, (1981) 4\nSCC 130, wherein a three Judge Bench of this Court held as under:-\n\n\"16. Mere chances of promotion are not conditions of service and the fact\nthat there was reduction in the chances of promotion did not tantamount to\na change in the conditions of service. A right to be considered for\npromotion is a term of service, but mere chances of promotion are not.\nUnder the Departmental Examination Rules for STOs, 1954, framed by the\nformer State Government of Madhya Pradesh, as amended on January 20, 1960,\nmere passing of the departmental examination conferred no right on the STIs\nof Bombay, to promotion. By passing the examination, they merely became\neligible for promotion. They had to be brought on to a select list not\nmerely on the length of service, but on the basis of merit-cum-seniority\nprinciple. It was, therefore, nothing but a mere chance of promotion. In\nconsequence of the impugned orders of reversion, all that happened is that\nsome of the STIs, who had wrongly been promoted as STOs Grade III had to be\nreverted and thereby lost a few places.\nIn contrast, the conditions of\nservice of ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad, at least so far as one\nstage of promotion above the one held by them before the reorganisation of\nStates, could not be altered without the previous sanction of the Central\nGovernment as\nlaid down in\nthe Proviso to sub-section (7) of Section 115 of\nthe Act.\"\n\n(ii) Reference may also be made to the decision of this Court in\nPalaru\nRamkrishnaiah & Ors. v. Union of India & Anr.\n, (1989) 2 SCC 541, wherein a\nthree Judge Bench of this Court held as under:-\n\n\"12. In the case of Ramchandra Shankar Deodhar, (1974) 1 SCC 317, the\npetitioners and other allocated Tahsildars from ex-Hyderabad State had\nunder the notification of the Raj Pramukh dated September 15, 1955 all the\nvacancies in the posts of Deputy Collector in the ex-Hyderabad State\navailable to them for promotion but under subsequent rules of July 30,\n1959, 50 per cent of the vacancies were to be filled by direct recruitment\nand only the remaining 50 per cent were available for promotion and that\ntoo on divisional basis. The effect of this change obviously was that now\nonly 50 per cent vacancies in the post of Deputy Collector being available\nin place of all the vacancies it was to take almost double the time for\nmany other allocated Tahsildars to get promoted as Deputy Collectors. In\nother words it resulted in delayed chance of promotion. It was, inter alia,\nurged on behalf of the petitioners that the situation brought about by the\nrules of July 30, 1959 constituted variation to their prejudice in the\nconditions of service applicable to them immediately prior to the\nreorganisation of the State and the rules were consequently invalid. While\nrepelling this submission the Constitution Bench held: (SCC p. 329, para\n\n15)\n\n\"All that happened as a result of making promotions to the posts of Deputy\nCollectors divisionwise and limiting such promotions to 50 per cent of the\ntotal number of vacancies in the posts of Deputy Collector was to reduce\nthe chances of promotion available to the petitioners. It is now well\nsettled by the decision of this Court in\nState of Mysore v. G. B. Purohit\n,\n1967 SLR 753, that though a right to be considered for promotion is a\ncondition of service, mere chances of promotion are not. A rule which\nmerely affect chances of promotion cannot be regarded as varying a\ncondition of service.\n\nIn\nPurohit\ncase (supra), the districtwise seniority\nof sanitary inspectors was changed to Statewise seniority, and as a result\nof this change the respondents went down in seniority and became very\njunior. This, it was urged, affected their chances of promotion which were\nprotected under the proviso to Section 115, sub-section (7). This\ncontention was negatived and Wanchoo, J., (as he then was), speaking on\nbehalf of this Court observed: 'It is said on behalf of the respondents\nthat as their chances of promotion have been affected their conditions of\nservice have been changed to their disadvantage. We see no force in this\nargument because chances of promotion are not conditions of service.' It\nis, therefore, clear that neither the Rules of 30-7-1959, nor the procedure\nfor making promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector divisionwise varies\nthe conditions of service of the petitioners to their disadvantage.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n15. It cannot be disputed that the Director General of Ordnance Factories\nwho had issued the Circular dated November 6, 1962 had the power to issue\nthe subsequent Circular dated January 20, 1966 also. In view of the legal\nposition pointed out above the aforesaid circular could not be treated to\nbe one affecting adversely any condition of service of the Supervisors 'A'.\n\nIts only effect was that the chance of promotion which had been accelerated\nby the Circular November 6, 1962 was deferred and made dependent on\nselection according to the Rules. Apparently, after the coming into force\nof the order dated December 28, 1965 and the Circular dated January 20,\n1966 promotions could not be made just on completion of two years'\nsatisfactory service under the earlier Circular dated November 6, 1962 the\nsame having been superseded by the later circular. It is further obvious\nthat in this view of the matter Supervisors 'A' who had been promoted\nbefore the coming into force of the order dated December 28, 1965 and the\nCircular dated January 20, 1966 stood in a class separate from those whose\npromotions were to be made thereafter. The fact that some Supervisors 'A'\nhad been promoted before the coming into force of the order dated December\n28, 1965 and the Circular dated January 20, 1966 could not, therefore,\nconstitute the basis for an argument that those Supervisors 'A' whose cases\ncame up for consideration for promotion thereafter and who were promoted in\ndue course in accordance with the rules were discriminated against. They\napparently did not fall in the same category.\"\n\n(iii) This Court had also declared the position of law, on the above\naspect of the matter, in\nSyed Khalid Rizvi & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n,\n1993 Supp. (3) SCC 575, wherein a three Judge Bench observed as under:-\n\n\"30. The next question is whether the seniority is a condition of service\nor a part of rules of recruitment?\nIn\nState of M.P. v. Shardul Singh\n,\n(1970) 1 SCC 108, this Court held that the term conditions of service means\nall those conditions which regulate the holding of a post by a person right\nfrom the time of his appointment (emphasis supplied) to his retirement and\neven beyond, in matters like pensions etc.\n\nIn\nI.N. Subba Reddy v. Andhra\nUniversity\n, (1977) 1 SCC 554, the same view was reiterated.\n\nIn\nMohd. Shujat\nAli v. Union of India\n, (1975) 3 SCC 76, a Constitution Bench held that the\nrule which confers a right to actual promotion or a right to be considered\nfor promotion is a rule prescribing a condition of the service. In Mohd.\n\nBhakar v. Krishna Reddy, 1970 SLR 768, another Constitution Bench held that\nany rule which affects the promotion of a person relates to his condition\nof service.\nIn\nState of Mysore v. G.B. Purohit\n, 1967 SLR 753, this Court\nheld that a rule which merely affects chances of promotion cannot be\nregarded as varying a condition of service. Chances of promotion are not\nconditions of service.\n\nThe same view was reiterated in another Constitution\nBench judgment in\nRamchandra Shankar Deodhar v. State of Maharashtra\n,\n(1974) 1 SCC 317. No doubt conditions of service may be classified as\nsalary, confirmation, promotion, seniority, tenure or termination of\nservice etc.\n\nas held in\nState of Punjab v. Kailash Nath\n, (1989) 1 SCC 321,\nby a Bench of two Judges but the context in which the law therein was laid\nmust be noted. The question therein was whether non-prosecution for a grave\noffence after expiry of four years is a condition of service? While\nnegativing the contention that non-prosecution after expiry of 4 years is\nnot a condition of service, this Court elaborated the subject and the above\nview was taken. The ratio therein does not have any bearing on the point in\nissue. Perhaps the question may bear relevance, if an employee was\ninitially recruited into the service according to the rules and promotion\nwas regulated in the same rules to higher echelons of service. In that\narena promotion may be considered to be a condition of service.\n\nIn\nA.K.\nBhatnagar v. Union of India\n, (1991) 1 SCC 544, this Court held that\nseniority is an incidence of service and where the service rules prescribe\nthe method of its computation it is squarely governed by such rules. In\ntheir absence ordinarily the length of service is taken into account. In\nthat case the direct recruits were made senior to the recruits by\nregularisation although the appellants were appointed earlier in point of\ntime and uninterruptedly remained in service as temporary appointees along\nwith the appellants but later on when recruited by direct recruitment, they\nwere held senior to the promotees.\n\n31. No employee has a right to promotion but he has only the right to be\nconsidered for promotion according to rules. Chances of promotion are not\nconditions of service and are defeasible. Take an illustration that the\nPromotion Regulations envisage maintaining integrity and good record by Dy.\nS.P. of State Police Service as eligibility condition for inclusion in the\nselect-list for recruitment by promotion to Indian Police Service.\nInclusion and approval of the name in the select-list by the UPSC, after\nconsidering the objections if any by the Central Government is also a\ncondition precedent. Suppose if 'B' is far junior to 'A' in State Services\nand 'B' was found more meritorious and suitable and was put in a select-\nlist of 1980 and accordingly 'B' was appointed to the Indian Police Service\nafter following the procedure. 'A' was thereby superseded by 'B'. Two years\nlater 'A' was found fit and suitable in 1984 and was accordingly appointed\naccording to rules. Can 'A' thereafter say that 'B' being far junior to him\nin State Service, 'A' should become senior to 'B' in the Indian Police\nService. The answer is obviously no because 'B' had stolen a march over 'A'\nand became senior to 'A'. Here maintaining integrity and good record are\nconditions of recruitment and seniority is an incidence of service. Take\nanother illustration that the State Service provides - rule of reservation\nto the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. 'A' is a general candidate\nholding No. 1 rank according to the roster as he was most meritorious in\nthe State service among general candidates. 'B' scheduled castes candidate\nholds No. 3 point in the roster and 'C', scheduled tribe holds No. 5 in the\nroster. Suppose Indian Police Service Recruitment Rules also provide\nreservation to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well. By\noperation of the equality of opportunity by\nArticles 14\n, 16(1)\n, 16(4)\nand\n, 'B' and 'C' were recruited by promotion from State Services to Central\nServices and were appointed earlier to 'A' in 1980. 'A' thereafter in the\nnext year was found suitable as a general candidate and was [pic]appointed\nto the Indian Police Service. Can 'A' thereafter contend that since 'B' and\n'C' were appointed by virtue of reservation, though were less meritorious\nand junior to him in the State service and gradation list would not become\nsenior to him in the cadre as IPS officer. Undoubtedly 'B' and 'C', by rule\nof reservation, had stolen a march over 'A' from the State Service. By\noperation of rule of reservation 'B' and 'C' became senior and 'A' became\njunior in the Central Services. Reservation and roster were conditions of\nrecruitment and seniority was only an incidence of service. The eligibility\nfor recruitment to the Indian Police Service, thus, is a condition of\nrecruitment and not a condition of service. Accordingly we hold that\nseniority, though, normally an incidence of service, Seniority Rules,\nRecruitment Rules and Promotion Regulations form part of the conditions of\nrecruitment to the Indian Police Service by promotion, which should be\nstrictly complied with before becoming eligible for consideration for\npromotion and are not relaxable.\"\n\n(iv) More recent in time, is the judgment rendered by another three Judge\nDivision Bench in S.S. Bola & Ors. v. B.D. Sardana & Ors., (1997) 8 SCC\n\n522. The majority opinion in the above judgment was rendered by Justice K.\nRamaswamy. In the process of consideration, he observed as under:-\n\n\"145. It is true that the Rules made under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof\nthe Constitution can be issued by amending or altering the Rules with\nretrospectivity as consistently held by this Court in a catena of\ndecisions, viz.,\nB.S. Vadera v. Union of India\n, AIR 1969 SC 118;\nRaj Kumar\nv. Union of India\n, (1975) 4 SCC 13;\nK. Nagaraj v. State of A.P.\n, (1985) 1\nSCC 523;\nT.R. Kapur v. State of Haryana\n, 1986 Supp. SCC 584, and a host of\nother decisions. But the question is whether the Rules can be amended\ntaking away the vested right.\n\nAs regards the right to seniority, this Court\nelaborately considered the incidence of the right to seniority and\namendment of the Act in the latest decision in\nAshok Kumar Gupta v. State\nof U.P.\n, (!977) 5 SCC 201, relieving the need to reiterate all of them once\nover. Suffice it to state that it is settled law that a distinction between\nright and interest has always been maintained. Seniority is a facet of\ninterest. The rules prescribe the method of selection/recruitment.\nSeniority is governed by the existing rules and is required to be worked\nout accordingly. No one has a vested right to promotion or seniority but an\nofficer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the Rules. It\nwould be taken away only by operation of valid law. Right to be considered\nfor promotion is a rule prescribed by conditions of service. A rule which\naffects the promotion of a person relates to conditions of service. The\nrule merely affecting the chances of promotion cannot be regarded as\nvarying the conditions of service. Chances of promotion are not conditions\nof service. A rule which merely affects the chances of promotion does not\namount to change in the conditions of service.\"\n\nConsequent upon the above detailed consideration, Justice K. Ramaswamy\nrecorded his conclusion in paragraph 153. On the issue in hand, sub-\nparagraph AB of paragraph 153 is relevant and is being extracted hereunder:-\n\n\"AB. A distinction between right to be considered for promotion and an\ninterest to be considered for promotion has always been maintained.\nSeniority is a facet of interest. The rules prescribe the method of\nrecruitment/selection. Seniority is governed by the rules existing as on\nthe date of consideration for promotion. Seniority is required to be worked\nout according to the existing rules. No one has a vested right to promotion\nor seniority. But an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by\nworking out the rules. The seniority should be taken away only by operation\nof valid law. Right to be considered for promotion is a rule prescribed by\nconditions of service. A rule which affects chances of promotion of a\nperson relates to conditions of service. The rule/provision in an Act\nmerely affecting the chances of promotion would not be regarded as varying\nthe conditions of service. The chances of promotion are not conditions of\nservice. A rule which merely affects the chances of promotion does not\namount to change in the conditions of service. However, once a declaration\nof law, on the basis of existing rules, is made by a constitutional court\nand a mandamus is issued or direction given for its enforcement by\npreparing the seniority list, operation of the declaration of law and the\nmandamus and directions issued by the Court is the result of the\ndeclaration of law but not the operation of the rules per se.\"\n\nJustice S. Saghir Ahmad concurred with the view expressed by Justice K.\nRamaswamy. A dissenting view was recorded by Justice G.B. Pattanaik. On\nthe subject in hand, however, there was no dissent. The conclusions\nrecorded by Justice G.B. Pattanaik were to the following effect:-\n\n\"199. To the said effect the judgment of this Court in the case of\nState of\nPunjab v. Kishan Das\n, (1971) 1 SCC 319, wherein this Court observed an\norder forfeiting the [pic]past service which has earned a government\nservant increments in the post or rank he holds, howsoever adverse it is to\nhim, affecting his seniority within the rank to which he belongs or his\nfuture chances of promotion, does not attract\nArticle 311(2)\nof the\nConstitution since it is not covered by the expression reduction in rank.\n\n200. Thus to have a particular position in the seniority list within a\ncadre can neither be said to be accrued or vested right of a government\nservant and losing some places in the seniority list within the cadre does\nnot amount to reduction in rank even though the future chances of promotion\nget delayed thereby. It was urged by Mr Sachar and Mr Mahabir Singh\nappearing for the direct recruits that the effect of redetermination of the\nseniority in accordance with the provisions of the Act is not only that the\ndirect recruits lose a few places of seniority in the rank of Executive\nEngineer but their future chances of promotion are greatly jeopardised and\nthat right having been taken away the Act must be held to be invalid. It is\ndifficult to accept this contention since chances of promotion of a\ngovernment servant are not a condition of service.\nIn the case of\nState of\nMaharashtra v. Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni\n, (1981) 4 SCC 130, this Court\nheld: (SCC p. 141, para 16)\n\n\"16. Mere chances of promotion are not conditions of service and the fact\nthat there was reduction in the chances of promotion did not tantamount to\na change in the conditions of service. A right to be considered for\npromotion is a term of service, but mere chances of promotion are not.\"\n\n201. To the said effect a judgment of this Court in the case of\nK.\nJagadeesan v. Union of India\n, (1990) 2 SCC 228, wherein this Court held:\n\n(SCC pp. 230-31, para 7)\n\"The only effect is that his chances of promotion or his right to be\nconsidered for promotion to the higher post is adversely affected. This\ncannot be regarded as retrospective effect being given to the amendment of\nthe rules carried out by the impugned notification and the challenge to the\nsaid notification on that ground must fail.\"\n\n202. Again in the case of\nUnion of India v. S.L. Dutta\n, (1991) 1 SCC 505,\nthis Court held: (SCC p. 512, para 17)\n\"In our opinion, what was affected by the change of policy were merely the\nchances of promotion of the Air Vice-Marshals in the Navigation Stream. As\nfar as the posts of Air Marshals open to the Air Vice-Marshals in the said\nstream were concerned, their right or eligibility to be considered for\npromotion still remained and hence, there was no change in their conditions\nof service.\"\n\nxxx xxx xxx\n\n212. So far as the rules dealing with Irrigation Branch are concerned, the\nsaid rules namely the Punjab Service of Engineers (Irrigation Branch) Class\nI Service Rules, 1964 have not been considered earlier by this Court at any\npoint of time. One Shri M.L. Gupta was appointed to the post of Assistant\nExecutive Engineer as a direct recruit on 27-8-1971, pursuant to the result\nof a competitive examination held by the Haryana Public Service Commission\nin December 1970. The said Shri Gupta was promoted to the post of Executive\nEngineer on 17-9-1976. He made a representation to the State Government to\nfix up his seniority in accordance with the service rules but as the said\nrepresentation was not disposed of for more than three years he approached\nthe High Court of Punjab and Haryana by filing CWP No. 4335 of 1984. That\npetition was disposed of by the High Court on the undertaking given by the\nState that the seniority will be fixed up soon. The said undertaking not\nhaving been complied with, the said Shri Gupta approached the High Court in\nJanuary 1986 by filing a contempt petition. In September 1986 the State\nGovernment fixed the inter se seniority of the said Shri Gupta and other\nmembers of the Service and Gupta was shown at Serial No. 72. Two promotees\nhad been shown at Serial Nos. 74 and 75. Those two promotees filed a writ\npetition challenging the fixation of inter se seniority between the direct\nrecruits and promotees and the High Court of Punjab and Haryana by its\njudgment passed in May 1987 quashed the order dated 29-9-1986 whereunder\nthe seniority of the direct recruits and promotees has been fixed and\ncalled upon the State Government to pass a speaking order assigning\nposition in the gradation list. The State Government issued a fresh\nnotification on 24-7-1987 giving detailed reasons reaffirming the earlier\nseniority which had been notified on 29-9-1986. Prior to the aforesaid\nnotification of the State Government Shri Gupta had filed a writ petition\nin the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had been registered as CWP No.\n[pic]6012 of 1986 claiming his seniority at No. 22 instead of 72 which had\nbeen given to him under the notification dated 29-9-1986. The promotees\nalso filed a writ petition challenging the government order dated 24-7-1987\nwhich was registered as CWP No. 5780 of 1987. Both the writ petitions, one\nfiled by the direct recruit, Shri Gupta, (CWP No. 6012 of 1986) and the\nother filed by the promotees (CWP No. 5780 of 1987) were disposed of by the\nlearned Single Judge by judgments dated 24-1-1992 and 4-3-1992,\nrespectively, whereunder the learned Single Judge accepted the stand of the\npromotees and Shri Gupta was placed below one Shri O.P. Gagneja. The said\nShri Gupta filed two appeals to the Division Bench against the judgment of\nthe learned Single Judge, which was registered as Letters Patent Appeals\nNos. 367 and 411 of 1992. The aforesaid letters patent appeals were allowed\nby judgment dated 27-8-1992. This judgment of the Division Bench of the\nPunjab and Haryana High Court was challenged by the State of Haryana in the\nSupreme Court which has been registered as CAs Nos. 1448-49 of 1993. This\nCourt granted leave and stayed the operation of the judgment in the matter\nof fixation of seniority. The promotees also challenged\nthe said judgment\n\nof the Division Bench in this Court which has been registered as CAs Nos.\n1452-1453 of 1993. During the pendency of these appeals in this Court, an\nOrdinance was promulgated on 13-5-1985 as Ordinance No. 6 of 1995 and the\nsaid Ordinance was replaced by the impugned Act 20 of 1995 by the Haryana\nLegislature. The validity of the Act was challenged by the said Shri Gupta\nand pursuant to the order of this Court the said writ petition having been\ntransferred to this Court has been registered as TC No. 40 of 1996. So far\nas the validity of the Act is concerned, the question of any usurpation of\njudicial power by the legislature does not arise in relation to the\nIrrigation Branch inasmuch as the Recruitment Rules of 1964 framed by the\nGovernor of Punjab in exercise of power under proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the\nConstitution which has been adapted by the State of Haryana on and from the\ndate Haryana was made a separate State had not been considered by this\nCourt nor has any direction been issued by this Court. The legislative\ncompetence of the State Legislature to enact the Act had also not been\nassailed and in our view rightly since the State Legislature has the powers\nunder Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to frame law governing\nthe conditions of service of the employees of the State Government. That\napart\nArticle 309\nitself stipulates that the appropriate legislature may\nregulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to\npublic services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of\nany State subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Proviso to\nArticle\nconfers power on the President in connection with the affairs of the\nUnion and on the Governor in connection with the affairs of the State to\nmake rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service until\nprovision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate\nlegislature under\nArticle 309\nmain part. In this view of the matter, the\nlegislative competence of the State Legislature to enact the legislation in\nquestion is beyond doubt. The only question which, therefore, arises for\nconsideration and which is contended in [pic]assailing the validity of the\nAct is that under the Act the direct recruits would lose several positions\nin the gradation list and thereby their accrued and vested rights would get\njeopardised and their future chances of promotion also would be seriously\nhampered and such violation tantamounts to violation of rights under Part\nIII of the Constitution. For the reasons already given while dealing with\nthe aforesaid contention in connection with the Public Health Branch and\nthe Buildings and Roads Branch the contention raised in the transfer case\ncannot be sustained and, therefore, the transfer case would stand\ndismissed. The Act in question dealing with the service conditions of the\nengineers belonging to the Irrigation Branch must be held to be a valid\npiece of legislation passed by the competent legislature and by giving it\nretrospective effect no constitutional provision has been violated nor has\nany right of the employee under Part III of the Constitution been infringed\nrequiring interference by this Court.\"\n\n(v) Finally, reference may be made to a decision rendered by this Court\nin\nUnion of India & Ors. v. Colonel G.S. Grewal\n, (2014) 7 SCC 303, wherein\nthis Court observed as under:-\n\n\"28. As pointed out above, the Tribunal has partly allowed the OA of the\nrespondent primarily on the ground that the decision contained in the\nGovernment Order dated 23-4-2010 amends the promotion policy\nretrospectively thereby taking away the rights already accrued to the\nrespondent in terms of the earlier policy. It is also mentioned that the\nrevised policy fundamentally changes the applicant's prospects of\npromotion. What is ignored is that the promotions already granted to the\nrespondent have not been taken away. Insofar as future chances of\npromotions are concerned, no vested right accrues as chance of promotion is\nnot a condition of service. Therefore, in the first instance, the Tribunal\nwill have to spell out as to what was the vested right which had already\naccrued to the respondent and that is taken away by the Policy decision\ndated 23-4-2010. In this process, other thing which becomes relevant is to\nconsider that once the respondent is permanently seconded in DGQA and he is\nallowed to remain there, can there be a change in his service conditions\nvis--vis others who are his counterparts in DGQA, but whose permanent\nsecondment is not in cloud? To put it otherwise, the sole reason for\nissuing Government Policy dated 23-4-2010 was to take care of those cases\nwhere permanent secondment to DGQA was wrongly given. As per the\nappellants, since the respondent had suffered final supersession, he was\nnot entitled to be seconded permanently to DGQA. This is disputed by the\nrespondent. That aspect will have to be decided first. That apart, even if\nit be so, as contended by the appellants, the appellants have not recalled\nthe permanent secondment order. They have allowed the respondent to stay in\nDGQA maintaining his promotion as Colonel as well, which was given pursuant\nto this secondment. The question, in such circumstances, that would arise\nis whether the respondent can be treated differently even if he is allowed\nto remain in DGQA viz. whether not allowing him to take further promotions,\nwhich benefit is still available to others whose permanent secondment is\nnot in dispute, would amount to discrimination or arbitrariness thereby\noffending\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. In our opinion,\nthese, and other related issues, will have to be argued and thrashed out\nfor coming to a proper conclusion.\"\n\n23. It is apparent from a collective perusal of the conclusions recorded\nin the judgments extracted in the foregoing paragraph, that chances of\npromotion do not constitute a condition of service. In that view of the\nmatter, it is inevitable to hold, that the High Court erred in recording\nits eventual determination on the basis of the fact that the promulgation\nof the TA Rules, 2003 and the STA Rules, 2003 was discriminatory and\narbitrary with regard to the fixation of the inter se seniority, since the\nsame seriously prejudiced the chances of promotion of the erstwhile members\nof the ministerial cadre, namely, those members of the original ministerial\ncadre, who had not opted for appointment/absorption into the cadre of Data\nEntry Operators, with reference to and in comparison with, those members of\nthe original ministerial cadre who had opted for appointment/absorption\ninto the cadre of Data Entry Operators.\n\n24. As a proposition of law it is imperative for us to record, that\nchances of promotion do not constitute conditions of service, and as such,\nmere alteration of chances of promotion, would not per se call for judicial\ninterference. The above general proposition would not be applicable, in\ncase the chances of promotion are altered arbitrarily, or on the basis of\nconsiderations which are shown to be perverse or mala fide.\n\n25. In the background of the factual and legal position debated and\nconcluded hereinabove, only one submission survives for our consideration,\nnamely, whether the inter se seniority determined at the initial\nconstitution of the cadres of Tax Assistants and Senior Tax Assistants\nunder Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 and Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003,\nrespectively, is acceptable in law. It is not the case of the appellants,\nthat any perversity or malafides are involved in the above determination,\nit is however the pointed submission of the appellants, that the same is\narbitrary and discriminatory. And therefore, violative of the provisions\nof\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. In this behalf, the\nsubmission advanced on their behalf was two-fold. Firstly, that dissimilar\nposts had been equated. And secondly, that the equation of posts\ndetermined merely on the pay-scales attached to them, would not be\nacceptable in law.\n\n26. Insofar as the former of the said two contentions is concerned, the\nsubmission was again two-fold. Firstly, reliance had been placed on Rule 4\nof the TA Rules, 2003. Under Rule 4(1) thereof, Upper Division Clerks and\nData Entry Operators Grade 'A' had been equated with one another, and\nmembers belonging to the aforesaid two cadres had been given the highest\nposition in the seniority list (at the stage of the initial constitution).\nThe inter se seniority amongst the Upper Division Clerks and Data Entry\nOperators, is mandated to be determined, for purposes of further promotion,\nwith effect from the date on which the concerned incumbent was appointed on\nregular basis as such. The submission advanced by the learned counsel was,\nthat sub-rule (2) of Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003, required a Data Entry\nOperator Grade 'A', who had come to be appointed as Tax Assistant, at the\ninitial constitution under the TA Rules, 2003, to pass a departmental\nexamination within two years of such appointment, failing which such Data\nEntry Operator Grade 'A', would not be entitled to any further increment.\nAccordingly, the submission advanced at the hands of learned counsel was,\nthat the aforesaid mandate clearly demonstrated, that a Data Entry Operator\nGrade 'A', had per se been found to be deficit, for discharging duties\nagainst the post of Tax Assistant. The aforesaid deficiency was sought to\nbe satisfied and fulfilled, according to learned counsel, by requiring the\nData Entry Operator Grade 'A', to qualify a departmental examination,\nwithin a period of two years. That being the acknowledged position\nemerging from the statutory rules, the contention advanced was, that the\npost of Data Entry Operator Grade 'A', could not have been treated as equal\nto the post of Upper Division Clerk, and as such, the determination of\ninter se seniority for onward promotion regulated by Rule 4(1) of the TA\nRules, 2003, must be deemed to be both arbitrary and discriminatory, and as\nsuch, violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n27. In order to counter the submission advanced at the hands of the\nlearned counsel, as has been narrated in the foregoing paragraph, it was\nthe contention of learned counsel representing the erstwhile Data Entry\nOperators Grade 'A', who came to be appointed as Tax Assistants, at the\ninitial constitution of the aforesaid cadre, under the mandate of Rule 4 of\nthe TA Rules, 2003, that the erstwhile members of the ministerial cadre, on\nthe above analogy, must also be likewise considered to be deficit in\neffectively discharging the duties assigned to the post of Tax Assistant,\ninasmuch as, sub-rule (3) of Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 likewise\nmandates, that a member of the ministerial cadre holding the post of Lower\nDivision Clerk on regular basis, and falling within the seniority list\ndetermined by the appointing authority, would have to pass the departmental\ncomputer proficiency examination. It was further submitted, that only from\nthe date of passing the above examination, the person concerned would be\ndeemed to have been promoted as Tax Assistant. It was the pointed\ncontention of learned counsel, that whilst the deficiency in Data Entry\nOperators Grade 'A', was with reference to lack of knowledge of relevant\nprocedures, the deficiency in members of the ministerial cadre was on\naccount of lack of knowledge relating to computer applications.\n\n28. Learned senior counsel representing the Union of India painstakingly\npointed out, that the ministerial cadre as it was originally constituted,\nhandled all procedures manually. Consequent upon a policy decision having\nbeen taken, it was decided to computerize the functioning of the Customs\nand Central Excise Department. This resulted in the promulgation of the\nElectronic Data Processing Posts (Group 'C' Technical Posts) Recruitment\nRules, 1992. The creation of the cadre of Data Entry Operators was\nconsidered to be imperative, to give effect to the aforesaid administrative\ndetermination, to computerize the functioning of the Customs and Central\nExcise Department. According to the learned senior counsel, on completion\nof the process of computerization it was felt, that for an effective\nfunctioning of the Customs and Central Excise Department, the existing\npersons who were proficient in matters of relevant procedures, needed\nworking experience with reference to computer applications. Likewise, Data\nEntry Operators, it was felt, needed proficiency with reference to relevant\nprocedures. Therefore, it was pointed out, that neither the erstwhile\nmembers of the ministerial cadre, nor the members of the cadre of Data\nEntry Operators, were fully qualified to handle the duties and\nresponsibilities in the Customs and Central Excise Department, after its\ncomputerization. Therefore, while merger of above two cadres was given\neffect to, the deficiencies in the two cadres were sought to be removed by\nrequiring them to qualify the prescribed departmental examination.\n\n29. A similar contention was advanced by learned counsel representing the\nprivate respondents, on the basis of Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003. We\nhave already analysed hereinabove the effect of merger contemplated under\nRule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003. Despite our analysis of the aforesaid\nprovision, to which learned counsel for the rival parties have expressed\ntheir approval, the contention advanced by the learned counsel was based on\nclause (v) of Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003. Yet again, the contention\nwas, that Data Entry Operators Grade 'C' could not be equated with\nAssistants, and likewise Data Entry Operators Grade 'B' could not be\nequated with Tax Assistants. The pointed submission in this behalf was,\nthat Data Entry Operators were required by the mandate of clause (v) of\nRule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003, to qualify a departmental examination for\nachieving proficiency in the relevant procedures, within two years, failing\nwhich they would not be eligible for any further increment. The instant\nsubmission is akin to the one advanced at the hands of learned counsel on\nthe basis of sub-rules (3) and (4) of Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003. The\nresponse at the hands of the learned senior counsel representing the Union\nof India, and the members of the cadre of Data Entry Operators was, that\nthe deficiency highlighted by the learned counsel with reference to Data\nEntry Operators need to be examined closely, inasmuch as, a similar\ndeficiency was likewise highlighted in clause (v) of Rule 5 of the STA\nRules, 2003, even with reference to erstwhile members of the ministerial\ncadre. The erstwhile members of the ministerial cadre, it was pointed out,\nwere required to qualify a departmental examination on the subject of\ncomputer applications, within two years, failing which they too would not\nbe eligible for any further increment.\n\n30. Learned senior counsel representing the Union of India, reiterated\nthe factual and legal position, as he had highlighted with reference to\nRule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003, whilst interpreting Rule 5 of the STA Rules,\n2003. Yet again it was pointed out, that on the completion of the\ncomputerization process, there were deficiencies in ministerial cadre, as\nalso, in the cadre of Data Entry Operators, and therefore, at the initial\nconstitution of the cadre of Senior Tax Assistants, the deficiencies in\nboth the cadres were sought to be satisfied, by providing for different\ndepartmental examinations for them. It was the contention of the learned\nsenior counsel representing the Union of India, that the submission of\nlearned counsel, pointing out deficiency in only one of the cadres, namely,\nthe cadre of Data Entry Operators, was wholly unjustified and unacceptable.\n\n31. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced\nat the hands of the learned counsel for the rival parties, on the basis of\nRule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003, and Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003, it is not\npossible for us to conclude, that members of either of the two cadres (the\nerstwhile ministerial cadre, and the cadre of Data Entry Operators) can be\ntreated to be superior to one or the other, on account of the pointed\ndeficiency, highlighted by the learned counsel. It clearly emerges from\nthe provisions relied upon, that consequent upon the completion of the\nprocess of computerization, in the Customs and Central Excise Department,\nthe erstwhile members of the ministerial cadre needed to be trained in\ncomputer applications, and the erstwhile members of the cadre of Data Entry\nOperators required to be instructed in relevant procedures. Thus viewed,\nit is not possible for us to accept the contention of learned counsel, that\neither of the two cadres ought to be treated as superior to the other. The\nfirst contention, premised on Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 and Rule 5 of\nthe STA Rules, 2003, respectively, is devoid of any merit, and is\naccordingly hereby rejected.\n\n32. We shall now deal with the second submission advanced before us\nduring the course of hearing, namely, the second contention noticed in\nparagraph 26 above. The pointed submission advanced before us was, that\nthe equation of posts under Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003, and under Rule 5\nof the STA Rules, 2003, was based exclusively on the pay-scales attached to\nthem. The resultant inter se seniority between the posts at the initial\nconstitution of the cadres under reference, was also based exclusively on\nthe pay-scales of the posts sought to be merged. The aforesaid\ndetermination, under Rules 4 and 5 referred to hereinabove, according to\nlearned counsel, is wholly impermissible in law.\n\n33.\nIn order to canvass the proposition noticed in the foregoing\nparagraph, learned counsel placed reliance on the decision rendered by this\nCourt in\nChandrakant Anant Kulkarni\n's case (supra). The controversy in the\njudgment cited for our consideration, was aimed at determining, whether\nthere was denial of fair and equitable treatment, within the meaning of sub-\nsection (5) of\nSection 115\nof the States Reorganization Act, 1956. The\naforesaid fair and equitable treatment was, with reference to the posts of\nAssistant Sales Tax Officers (from the former States of Madhya Pradesh and\nHyderabad) and Sales Tax Inspectors (from the former State of Bombay), who\nwere allocated to the new State of Bombay. The question which arose for\nconsideration, also had a bearing on the right to promotion to the next\nhigher post of Sales Tax Officer. This Court while determining the above\ncontroversy, held as under:-\n\n\"9. Prior to the reorganisation of the States, a conference of the Chief\nSecretaries of the States that were to be affected by the reorganisation\nwas held at Delhi on May 18 and 19, 1956 for the purpose of the formulation\nof the principles upon which integration of services was to be effected.\nThe Government of India by their letter dated April 3, 1957 informed the\nState Government that the work of integration of services should be dealt\nwith by them in the light of the general principles already settled at the\nChief Secretaries Conference. This has been construed to be a valid\ndelegation of powers to prepare the preliminary and final gradation lists\nunder the direction and with the sanction of the Central Government. The\nGovernment of India by its circular dated May 11, 1957 to all the State\nGovernments stated inter alia that it agreed with the views expressed on\nbehalf of the States' representatives that it would not be appropriate to\nprovide any protection in the matter of departmental promotion. This\ncircular has been interpreted as a prior approval of the Central Government\nin terms of the proviso to sub-[pic]section (7) of\nSection 115\nof the Act\nin the matter of change in the conditions of service relating to\ndepartmental promotions.\n\n10. The following principles had been formulated for being observed as\nfar as may be, in the integration of government servants allotted to the\nservices of the new States:\n\n\"In the matter of equation of posts:\n\n(i) Where there were regularly constituted similar cadres in the\ndifferent integrating units the cadres will ordinarily be integrated on\nthat basis; but\n\n(ii) Where, however, there were no such similar cadres the following\nfactors will be taken into consideration in determining the equation of\nposts-\n\n(a) nature and duties of a post;\n\n(b) powers exercised by the officers holding a post, the extent of\nterritorial or other charge held or responsibilities discharged;\n\n(c) the minimum qualifications, if any, prescribed for recruitment to the\npost, and\n\n(d) the salary of the post.\"\n\nIt is well settled that these principles have a statutory force.\n\n11. There is a long line of decisions of this Court starting from the\n\nUnion of India v. P.K. Roy\n, (1968) 2 SCR 186, laying down that the Central\nGovernment has been constituted to be the final authority in the matter of\nintegration of services under sub-section (5) of\nSection 115\nof the Act.\nThe matter of equation of posts is purely an administrative function. It\nhas been left entirely to the Central Government as to how it has to deal\nwith these questions. The Central Government had established an Advisory\nCommittee for the purpose of assisting in the proper consideration of the\nrepresentations made to it. There is nothing in\nSections 115\nto\nof the\nAct prohibiting the Central Government in any way from taking the aid and\nassistance of the State Government in the matter of effecting the\nintegration of services.\n\nAs observed by this Court in\nRoy\ncase the usual\nprocedure followed by the Central Government in the matter of integration\nof services generally, is in order. It is not open to the court to consider\nwhether the equation of posts made by the Central Government is right or\nwrong. This was a matter exclusively within the province of the Central\nGovernment. Perhaps, the only question the court can enquire into is\nwhether the four principles agreed upon at the Chief Secretaries Conference\nhad been properly taken into account. This is the narrow and limited field\nwithin which the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court can operate. But\nwhere, as here, in the matter of equation of posts, the Central Government\nhad properly taken into account all the four principles decided upon at the\nChief Secretaries Conference, the decision cannot be assailed at all. In\nthe present case, not[pic]only the Central Government had laid down the\nprinciples for integration, but also considered the representations and\npassed the final orders and the provisional gradation lists were prepared\nand published by the State Government under the direction and with the\nsanction of the Central Government.\n\n12. In accordance with the principles settled at the Chief Secretaries\nConference, the Government of India, in consultation with the Central\nAdvisory Committee, directed that the posts of ASTOs in the former States\nof Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad should be continued in an isolated\ncategory, there being no corresponding post in the successor State of\nBombay with which they could be equated. There were 19 ASTOs in the pay\nscale of Rs 150-10-200-EB-15-250 from Madhya Pradesh and 23 ASTOs in the\npay scale of Rs 170-8-225-EB-13-320 from Hyderabad allocated to the new\nState of Bombay. In the former State of Bombay there was no similarly\nconstituted cadre of ASTOs, but there were posts of STIs in the pay scale\nof Rs 120-8-144-EB-8-200-10/2-250. It would have been inequitable and\nunfair to equate ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad with STIs from\nBombay, looking to the nature of their posts, the powers and\nresponsibilities and the pay scales attached to the same. The ASTOs from\nMadhya Pradesh and Hyderabad were, in the first instance, superior to STIs\nin their respective States and the post of ASTO in those States was a\npromotion post. In addition, ASTOs in those States were Assessing\nAuthorities and they enjoyed statutory powers of their own to assess tax\nand levy penalties, whereas the STIs in Bombay had no such powers to assess\ntax or levy penalty but had merely to scrutinise returns and generally act\nin a subordinate capacity to STOs. Evidently, the State Government was\nwrong in directing by its Resolution dated November 16, 1957 that the\nseniority of ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad and STIs from Bombay\nbe fixed in the cadre of STIs in the reorganised State of Bombay on the\nbasis of continuous service including that in the lower grade. The\nprinciple adopted by the State Government for determining their relative\ninter se seniority was obviously wrong, being contrary to the principles\nsettled at the Chief Secretaries Conference. As already stated, the\nGovernment of India, on representation by the affected ASTOs from Madhya\nPradesh and Hyderabad, in consultation with the Central Advisory Committee,\ndirected that the inter se seniority should be fixed taking into account\ncontinuous service in the equated grade only subject to the inter se\nseniority of the officers coming from the several integrating regions. Upon\nthat basis, the State Government by its Resolution dated September 10,\n1960, rightly modified Notes 3 and 6 of its 1957 Resolution and directed\nthat the seniority as on November 1, 1956 of ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and\nHyderabad be fixed above the persons in the cadre of STIs and that the\ninter se seniority of ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad be fixed on\nthe basis of their continuous service as ASTOs in their respective States.\"\n\nHaving dealt with the controversy on the parameters recorded through the\naforesaid observations, this Court concluded as under:-\n\n\"19. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the condition regarding the\npassing of the departmental examination became incapable of compliance in\nthe case of ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad who had been\n[pic]promoted as STOs Grade III. They were entitled to such promotion\nwithout passing such examination. Under the relevant rules which regulated\ntheir conditions of service, there was only a possibility of reversion in\nthe eventuality of their not passing the examination within the stipulated\ntime. Since no examinations admittedly have been held, there is no question\nof their reversion as ASTOs. If the decision of the High Court were to be\nupheld, it would imply that many of the ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and\nHyderabad who had been promoted as STOs Grade III and during the past 20\nyears have reached the higher echelons of service, would now have to be put\nback as ASTOs, for no fault of their own. Many of them either have retired\nor are on the verge of retirement.\n\n20. There was thus no alternative for the State Government but to suspend\nthe operation of the amendment made on January 20, 1961 to Rule 1 (b)(ii)\nof the Recruitment Rules, by its order dated October 1, 1965, which made\nthe passing of the STO examination a condition precedent for promotion of\nSTIs to STO Grade III. There can be no doubt that the State Government's\nResolution dated June 13, 1964 and its memorandum of November 21, 1964,\nclarifying that the ASTOs from Madhya Pradesh and Hyderabad were entitled\nfor promotion to the post of STO Grade III without passing the departmental\nexamination, placed STIs from Bombay at a disadvantage. To ensure 'fair and\nequitable treatment', the State Government rightly dispensed with the\nrequirement of passing the departmental examination in the case of STIs\nfrom the former State of Bombay.\n\n21. In the end, reverting back to the main question. On an overall view\nof things, we are satisfied that the State Government acted with the best\nof intentions. It endeavoured to strike a balance between the competing\nclaims to relative seniority. When sub-section (5) of\nSection 115\nof the\nAct speaks of \"fair and equitable treatment\", obviously it envisages a\ndecision which is fair and equitable to all.\"\n\n34. Reliance was also placed on the decision of this Court in\nS.P.\nShivprasad Pipal v. Union of India & Ors.\n, (1998) 4 SCC 598. In\nthe said\njudgment\n, this Court considered the validity of the notification dated\n3.2.1987, which had resulted in the constitution of a Central Labour\nService, by a merger of three existing cadres. According to the appellant\nbefore this Court, the three cadres which were sought to be amalgamated,\nhad different statutory functions, different qualifications and different\nduties and powers. By merging the three cadres, according to the appellant\nbefore this Court, unequals had been treated as equals. The pointed\ncontention on behalf of the appellant, who belonged to one of the three\ncadres was, that he had been placed in a condition, worse than the position\nhe occupied in the original cadre. The claim of the appellant was, that\nhis chances of promotion had been substantially diminished. One of the\ngrounds for raising the challenge was, that the merger of the three cadres\nwas in violation of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\n\nThis\nCourt having taken into consideration the decision in the\nChandrakant Anant\nKulkarni\n's case (supra), concluded as under:-\n\n\"14. The Cadre Review Committee after examining the kinds of duties\ndischarged by these officers decided that since they all worked in the area\nof labour welfare, it would be desirable that they could widen their\nexperience. This would be possible if the cadres were integrated and the\nposts were made interchangeable so that the members of the cadre could get\na more varied experience in different areas of labour welfare, thus making\nfor a better-equipped cadre. Therefore, although the exact nature of work\ndone by the three cadres was different, it would be difficult to say that\none cadre was superior or inferior to the other cadre or service.\n\n15. A decision to merge such cadres is essentially a matter of policy.\nSince the three cadres carried the same pay scale at the relevant time,\nmerging of the three cadres cannot be said to have caused any prejudice to\nthe members of any of the cadres. The total number of posts were also\nincreased proportionately when the merger took place so that the percentage\nof posts available on promotion was not in any manner adversely affected by\nthe merger of the cadres.\n\n16. The appellant, however, contends that as a result of the merger his\npromotional chances have been very adversely affected because his position\n[pic]in the seniority list has gone down. Rule 9 of the Central Labour\nService Rules, 1987 under which the merger is effected, lays down the rules\nof seniority. It provides that the inter se seniority of the officers\nappointed to the various grades mentioned in Schedule I at the initial\nconstitutional stage of the service shall be determined according to the\nlength of regular continuous service in the grade subject to maintenance in\nthe respective grade of inter se seniority of officers recruited in their\nrespective original cadres. The proviso to this Rule prescribes that\nalthough Assistant Labour Commissioner (Central), Labour Officer and\nAssistant Welfare Commissioner shall be equated, all Assistant Labour\nCommissioners (Central) holding such posts on or before 31-12-1972 shall be\nen bloc senior to Labour Officers and (2) Senior Labour Officers and\nRegional Labour Commissioners shall be equated. But all Regional Labour\nCommissioners holding such posts on or before 2-3-1980 shall be en bloc\nsenior to the Senior Labour Officers.\n\n17. Explaining the proviso the respondents have said that before 31-12-\n1972 Assistant Labour Commissioners were in a higher pay scale than Labour\nOfficers. The parity between their pay scales came about only from January\n1973. That is why to preserve their inter se position, Assistant Labour\nCommissioners appointed prior to 31-12-1972 have been placed above Labour\nOfficers. Similarly, Regional Labour Commissioners drew a higher pay scale\nthan Senior Labour Officers prior to 1980. The parity has come about in\n1980 and hence Regional Labour Commissioners holding such posts on or\nbefore 2-3-1980 have been placed above Senior Labour Officers.\n\n18. The seniority rules have thus been carefully framed taking all\nrelevant factors into consideration. The respondents have also pointed out\nthat as a matter of fact, by reason of the merger, the appellant has not,\nin fact, suffered any prejudice and he has also received promotions.\n\n19. However, it is possible that by reason of such a merger, the chance\nof promotion of some of the employees may be adversely affected, or some\nothers may benefit in consequence. But this cannot be a ground for setting\naside the merger which is essentially a policy decision. This Court in\n\nUnion of India v. S.L. Dutta\n, (1991) 1 SCC 505, examined this contention.\n\nIn\nS.L. Dutta\ncase a change in the promotional policy was challenged on the\nground that as a result, service conditions of the respondent were\nadversely affected since his chances of promotion were reduced.\n\nRelying\nupon the decision in the\nState of Maharashtra v. Chandrakant Anant\nKulkarni\n, (1981) 4 SCC 130, this Court held that a mere chance of promotion\nwas not a condition of service and the fact that there was a reduction in\nthe chance of promotion would not amount to a change in the conditions of\nservice.\"\n\n35. It is in the background of the aforesaid submission advanced at the\nhands of learned counsel, that we would consider the validity of the merger\nof cadres contemplated by Rule 4 of the TA Rules, 2003 and Rule 5 of the\nSTA Rules, 2003. The position in the present controversy is not comparable\nto the position examined by this Court in the judgments referred to\nhereinabove. It needs to be understood, that the cadre of Data Entry\nOperators, was created out of the original ministerial cadre. It is,\ntherefore apparent, that the members of the two cadres were originally\ndischarging similar duties. It is only as a consequence of the\nadministrative decision to computerize the functioning of the Customs and\nCentral Excise Department, that a separate cadre of Data Entry Operators\ncame to be created. The newly created cadre, exclusively functioned\ntowards giving effect to the decision to computerize the functioning of the\ndepartment. There was thereafter a division of duties discharged by the\noriginal members of the ministerial cadre. One cadre of employees\nexclusively thereafter discharged procedural duties of the department,\nwhereas, the other cadre of employees exclusively thereafter discharged\nduties aimed at computerization of the functioning of the department. Even\nthough, it is apparent, that the Data Entry Operators exclusively\nfunctioned towards the process of computerization of the functioning of the\nCustoms and Central Excise Department, yet that could not be possible\nwithout their existing experience in the erstwhile ministerial cadre.\nConsequent upon the merger of posts, consequent, upon the promulgation of\nthe TA Rules, 2003, and the STA Rules, 2003, the nature and duties of the\ntwo cadres were combined. Consequent upon their appointment as Tax\nAssistants and Senior Tax Assistants, members of the erstwhile ministerial\ncadre, and members of the cadre of Data Entry Operators, were required to\nperform both procedural duties and duties relating to computer\napplications. The deficiencies in the two cadres sought to be merged, were\nsought to be overcome, by subjecting the members of the two cadres to\ndifferent examinations, whereby, the two cadres were trained for\ndischarging their duties efficiently, on merger, whilst holding the posts\nof Tax Assistants/Senior Tax Assistants. It is, therefore, not possible\nfor us to accept, that there was any serious difference between the two\nmerged cadres, either on the issue of nature of duties, or on the subject\nof powers exercised by the officers holding the post, or the extent of\nterritorial or other charge held, or responsibilities discharged by them,\nor for that matter, the qualifications prescribed for the posts. On\naccount of the aforesaid, by and large similarity, we are satisfied, that\nthe merger of the cadres, and the determination of the inter se seniority\non merger, were justifiably determined, on the basis of the different pay-\nscales of the cadres merged, under the TA Rules, 2003 and the STA Rules,\n2003. By the mandate of the above Rules, all posts in equivalent pay-scales\nwere placed at the same level. Posts in the higher scale of pay, were\ngiven superiority on the subject of inter se seniority, with reference to\nposts in the lower scale of pay. In our considered view, the above\ndetermination, at the hands of the rule framing authority, on the issue\ncanvassed before us, cannot be termed either arbitrary or discriminatory.\nWe are, therefore satisfied in concluding, that the provisions of Rule 4 of\nthe TA Rules, 2003 and Rule 5 of the STA Rules, 2003, cannot be faulted on\nthe touchstone of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India.\n\n36. For all the reasons recorded hereinabove, we are satisfied, that the\ndifferent orders passed by the Administrative Tribunal, and the common\norder dated 13.4.2007 passed by the High Court, are liable to be set aside.\nThe same are accordingly hereby set aside. The appeals filed by those who\nmoved to the cadre of Data Entry Operators from the ministerial cadre, and\nwere thereupon amalgamated in the cadre of Tax Assistants/Senior Tax\nAssistants, are allowed. The connected appeals preferred by the Union of\nIndia, are also allowed. In the above view of the matter, the authorities\nshall give effect to Rules 4 and 5 of the TA Rules, 2003 and the STA Rules,\n2003, respectively, without any further delay.\n\n.................................J.\n(Jagdish Singh Khehar)\n\n.................................J.\n(S.A.

THE PRESENT CONTROVERSY IS YET ANOTHER SENIORITY DISPUTE AMONGST EMPLOYEES OF THE CUSTOMS AND CENTRAL EXCISE DEPARTMENT. THE CONTROVERSY HEREIN HAS EMERGED ON ACCOUNT OF A RECONSTITUTION OF CADRES. IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, A SEPARATE CADRE WAS CONSTITUTED, OUT OF THE EXISTING MINISTERIAL CADRE, FOR DISCHARGING ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS WAS NECESSITATED BY THE DECISION OF THE DEPARTMENT TO INTRODUCE COMPUTERIZATION, IN ITS FUNCTIONING. THE INSTANT COMPUTERIZATION PROJECT, WHICH COMMENCED IN 1991-92, SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN OR AROUND 2002-03. CONSEQUENT UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF THE ABOVE OBJECTIVE, THE SEPARATE CADRE SO CREATED, WAS SOUGHT TO BE RE-AMALGAMATED WITH THE EXISTING MINISTERIAL CADRE. THE ABOVE NOTICED BIFURCATION AND RE- AMALGAMATION, RESULTED IN A CO-INCIDENTAL CAREER ADVANCEMENT, FOR THOSE WHO HAD ACCEPTED TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL MINISTERIAL CADRE. SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE ORIGINALLY PLACED AT INFERIOR POSITIONS IN THE SENIORITY LIST OF THE ORIGINAL MINISTERIAL CADRE, ACQUIRED SUPERIORITY OVER THEIR COUNTERPARTS (IN THE ORIGINAL MINISTERIAL CADRE), CONSEQUENT UPON THEIR PROMOTION WITHIN THE CADRE OF DATA ENTRY OPERATORS, WHICH RESULTED IN THEIR ACQUIRING A HIGHER POSITION IN SENIORITY, OVER AND ABOVE THOSE WHO WERE SENIOR TO THEM IN THE ORIGINAL MINISTERIAL CADRE. BEFORE EMBARKING UPON THE NICETIES OF THE SENIORITY DISPUTE, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO DELVE UPON THE REASONS OF THE AFORE-STATED BIFURCATION, AND RE-AMALGAMATION OF CADRES. THE INSTANT ASPECT OF THE MATTER IS ACCORDINGLY BEING DEALT WITH, IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS.  2. THE MINISTERIAL CADRE AS IT ORIGINALLY EXISTED, COMPRISED OF POSTS OF DEPUTY OFFICE SUPERINTENDENTS (LEVELS 1 AND 2), UPPER DIVISION CLERKS, LOWER DIVISION CLERKS, STENOGRAPHERS (SENIOR GRADE AND ORDINARY GRADE), DRAFTSMEN ETC. CONDITIONS OF SERVICE OF MEMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL MINISTERIAL CADRE, WERE REGULATED BY THE CENTRAL EXCISE AND LAND CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT GROUP 'C' POSTS RECRUITMENT RULES, 1979 (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS, THE 1979 RULES). MEMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL MINISTERIAL CADRE REGULATED BY THE PROVISIONS OF THE 1979 RULES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR PROMOTION TO THE POST OF INSPECTOR (ORDINARY SCALE) - AN EXECUTIVE CADRE POST. AND THEREUPON, EVEN FURTHER PROMOTION, IN THE EXECUTIVE CADRE.  3. CONSEQUENT UPON THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE FOURTH CENTRAL PAY COMMISSION IN PARAGRAPH 11.45 OF ITS REPORT, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA TOOK UPON ITSELF THE RESPONSIBILITY TO EXAMINE THE RATIONALIZATION OF PAY SCALES FOR POSTS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISCHARGING WORK RELATING TO DATA ENTRY. THE TASK SOUGHT TO BE UNDERTAKEN WAS TO PRESCRIBE UNIFORM PAY SCALES AND DESIGNATIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING POSTS, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL. CONSEQUENT UPON THE SUGGESTIONS MADE BY A COMMITTEE SET UP BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ELECTRONICS IN NOVEMBER, 1986, THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA DECIDED TO INTRODUCE THE FOLLOWING UNIFORM PATTERN FOR ELECTRONIC DATA PROCESSING POSTS:-  |S.NO. |DESIGNATION OF POST |PAY SCALE | | | | DATA ENTRY OPERATORS | | |1. |DATA ENTRY OPERATOR |RS.1150-1500 |THIS WILL BE ENTRY | | |GRADE 'A' | |GRADE FOR HIGHER | | | | |SECONDARY WITH |"
