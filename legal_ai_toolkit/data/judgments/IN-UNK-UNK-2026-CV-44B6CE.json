So also relied paragraph 4 that\n there cannot be the test to proportion of SCs and STs to the\n population of India be the test for determining adequacy of\n representation in promotional posts.

Ahmadi, Hon'ble\nJustice RAtnavel Pandian and Hon'ble Justice Shri P.B. Sawant\nconcurring. Relevant paragraph 859 and 860 reads as under -\n\n \"859. We may summarise our answers to the various questions\n dealt with and answered hereinabove:\n\n (1) (a) It is not necessary that the 'provision' under \nArticle 16(4)\n\n should necessarily be made by the Parliament/Legislature.\n\n Such a provision can be made by the Executive also. Local\n bodies, Statutory Corporations and other instrumentalities\n of the State falling under \nArticle 12\n of the Constitution are\n themselves competent to make such a provision, if so\n advised. (Paras 735-737)\n\n (b) An executive order making a provision under \nArticle 16(4)\n is\n enforceable the moment it is made and issued. (Paras 738-740)\n (2) (a) Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n is not an exception to clause (1). It is an\n instance and an illustration of the classification inherent in clause\n (1). (Paras 741-742)\n\n (b) \nArticle 16(4)\n is exhaustive of the subject of reservation in favour of\n backward class of citizens, as explained in this judgment. (Para\n\n 743)\n\n (c) Reservations can also be provided under clause (1) of \nArticle 16.\n It\n is not confined to extending of preferences, concessions or\n exemptions alone. These reservations, if any, made under clause\n (1) have to be so adjusted and implemented as not to exceed the\n level of representation prescribed for 'backward class of citizens' --\n as explained in this Judgment. (Para 745)\n (3) (a) A caste can be and quite often is a social class in India. If it is\n backward socially, it would be a backward class for the purposes\n of \nArticle 16(4).\n Among non-Hindus, there are several occupational\n groups, sects and denominations, which for historical reasons, are\n socially backward. They too represent backward social\n collectivities for the purposes of \nArticle 16(4).\n (Paras 746 to 779)\n\n (b) Neither the Constitution nor the law prescribes the procedure or\n method of identification of backward classes. Nor is it possible or\n advisable for the court to lay down any such procedure or method.\n It must be left to the authority appointed to identify. It can adopt\n such method/procedure as it thinks convenient and so long as its\n survey covers the entire populace, no objection can be taken to it.\n Identification of the backward classes can certainly be done with\n reference to castes among, and along with, other occupational\n groups, classes and sections of people. One can start the process\n either with occupational groups or with castes or with some other\n groups. Thus one can start the process with the castes, wherever\n they are found, apply the criteria (evolved for determining\n backwardness) and find out whether it satisfies the criteria. If it\n does -- what emerges is a \"backward class of citizens\" within the\n meaning of and for the purposes of \nArticle 16(4).\n Similar process\n can be adopted in the case of other occupational groups,\n communities and classes, so as to cover the entire populace. The\n central idea and overall objective should be to consider all\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 53\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n available groups, sections and classes in society. Since caste\n represents an existing, identifiable social group/class\n encompassing an overwhelming minority of the country's\n population, one can well begin with it and then go to other groups,\n sections and classes. (Paras 780 and 785).\n\n (c) It is not correct to say that the backward class of citizens\n contemplated in \nArticle 16(4)\n is the same as the socially and\n educationally backward classes referred to in \nArticle 15(4).\n It is\n much wider. The accent in \nArticle 16(4)\n is on social backwardness.\n Of course, social, educational and economic backwardness are\n closely inter-twined in the Indian context. (Paras 786-789)\n\n (d) 'Creamy layer' can be, and must be excluded. (Paras 790-793)\n\n (e) It is not necessary for a class to be designated as a backward class\n that it is situated similarly to the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled\n Tribes. (Paras 794 and 797)\n\n (f) The adequacy of representation of a particular class in the\n services under the State is a matter within the subjective\n satisfaction of the appropriate Government. The judicial\n scrutiny in that behalf is the same as in other matters\n within the subjective satisfaction of an authority. (Para 798)\n (4) (a) A backward class of citizens cannot be identified only and\n exclusively with reference to economic criteria. (Para 799)\n\n (b) It is, of course, permissible for the Government or other authority\n to identify a backward class of citizens on the basis of occupation-\n cum-income, without reference to caste, if it is so advised. (Para\n\n 800)\n (5) There is no constitutional bar to classify the backward classes of\n citizens into backward and more backward categories. (Paras 801\n to 803)\n (6) (a) and (b) The reservations contemplated in clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n\n should not exceed 50%. While 50% shall be the rule, it is necessary\n not to put out of consideration certain extraordinary situations\n inherent in the great diversity of this country and the people. It\n might happen that in far-flung and remote areas the population\n inhabiting those areas might, on account of their being out of the\n mainstream of national life and in view of the conditions peculiar to\n end characteristic of them need to be treated in a different way,\n some relaxation in this strict rule may become imperative. In doing\n so, extreme caution is to be exercised and a special case made out.\n (Paras 804 to 813)\n\n (c) The rule of 50% should be applied to each year. It cannot be\n related to the total strength of the class, category, service or\n cadre, as the case may be. (Para 814)\n\n \n(\nd) Devadasan [T. Devadasan v. Union of India\n, (1964) 4 SCR 680 :\n\n AIR 1964 SC 179 : (1965) 2 LLJ 560] was wrongly decided and is\n accordingly overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with this\n judgment. (Paras 815 to 818)\n (7) \nArticle 16(4)\n does not permit provision for reservations in the\n matter of promotion. This rule shall, however, have only\n prospective operation and shall not affect the promotions\n already made, whether made on regular basis or on any\n other basis. We direct that our decision on this question\n shall operate only prospectively and shall not affect\n promotions already made, whether on temporary, officiating\n or regular/permanent basis. It is further directed that\n wherever reservations are already provided in the matter of\n promotion -- be it Central Services or State Services, or for\n that matter services under any Corporation, authority or\n body falling under the definition of 'State' in \nArticle 12 --\n\n such reservations may continue in operation for a period of\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 54\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n five years from this day. Within this period, it would be open\n to the appropriate authorities to revise, modify or re-issue\n the relevant rules to ensure the achievement of the objective\n of \nArticle 16(4).\n If any authority thinks that for ensuring\n adequate representation of 'backward class of citizens' in\n any service, class or category, it is necessary to provide for\n direct recruitment therein, it shall be open to it to do so.\n (Ahmadi, J expresses no opinion on this question upholding\n the preliminary objection of Union of India). It would not be\n impermissible for the State to extend concessions and\n relaxations to members of reserved categories in the matter\n of promotion without compromising the efficiency of the\n administration. (Paras 819 to 831)\n (8) While the rule of reservation cannot be called anti-meritarian, there\n are certain services and posts to which it may not be advisable to\n apply the rule of reservation. (Paras 832 to 841)\n (9) There is no particular or special standard of judicial\n scrutiny applicable to matters arising under \nArticle 16(4).\n\n (Para 842)\n (10) The distinction made in the impugned Office Memorandum dated\n September 25, 1991 between 'poorer sections' and others among\n the backward classes is not invalid, if the classification is\n understood and operated as based upon relative backwardness\n among the several classes identified as Other Backward Classes,\n as explained in paras 843-844 of this Judgment. (Para 843-844)\n (11) The reservation of 10% of the posts in favour of 'other\n economically backward sections of the people who are not covered\n by any of the existing schemes of the reservation' made in the\n impugned Office Memorandum dated September 25, 1991 is\n constitutionally invalid and is accordingly struck down. (Para 845)\n (13) The Government of India and the State Governments have the\n power to, and ought to, create a permanent mechanism -- in the\n nature of a Commission -- for examining requests of inclusion and\n complaints of over-inclusion or non-inclusion in the list of OBCs and\n to advise the Government, which advice shall ordinarily be binding\n upon the Government. Where, however, the Government does not\n accept the advice, it must record its reasons therefor. (Para 847)\n (14) In view of the answers given by us herein and the directions\n issued herewith, it is not necessary to express any opinion on the\n correctness and adequacy of the exercise done by the Mandal\n Commission. It is equally unnecessary to send the matters back to\n the Constitution Bench of five Judges. (Paras 848 to 850).\n\n \n[Emphasis supplied]\n\nB. The five-Judge Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in case of \nR.K. Sabharwal and Ors. Vs. State of Punjab\n& Ors.\n (1995) 2 SCC 745.\n \nTheir Lordships were seisin with the\nissue related to the reservation in promotion in roster system\ntaking into consideration entire cadre strength to determine\nlimit as per judgement in case of \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra). Their\nLordships in paragraph 4 and 5 observed and to appreciate the\ncontroversy reproduced as under -\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 55\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n \"4. When a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of a\n particular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve points, it\n has to be taken that the posts shown at the reserve points are\n to be filled from amongst the members of reserve categories\n and the candidates belonging to the general category are not\n entitled to be considered for the reserved posts. On the other\n hand the reserve category candidates can compete for the non-\n reserve posts and in the event of their appointment to the said\n posts their number cannot be added and taken into\n consideration for working out the percentage of reservation.\n \nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution of India permits the State Government\n to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in\n favour of any Backward Class of citizens which, in the opinion of the\n State is not adequately represented in the Services under the State. It\n is, therefore, incumbent on the State Government to reach a conclusion\n that the Backward Class/Classes for which the reservation is made is\n not adequately represented in the State Services. While doing so the\n State Government may take the total population of a particular\n Backward Class and its representation in the State Services. When the\n State Government after doing the necessary exercise makes the\n reservation and provides the extent of percentage of posts to be\n reserved for the said Backward Class then the percentage has to be\n followed strictly. The prescribed percentage cannot be varied or\n changed simply because some of the members of the Backward\n Class have already been appointed/promoted against the\n general seats. As mentioned above the roster point which is reserved\n for a Backward Class has to be filled by way of\n appointment/promotion of the member of the said class. No general\n category candidate can be appointed against a slot in the\n roster which is reserved for the Backward Class. The fact that\n considerable number of members of a Backward Class have\n been appointed/promoted against general seats in the State\n Services may be a relevant factor for the State Government to\n review the question of continuing reservation for the said class\n but so long as the instructions/rules providing certain\n percentage of reservations for the Backward Classes are\n operative the same have to be followed. Despite any number of\n appointees/promotees belonging to the Backward Classes\n against the general category posts the given percentage has to\n be provided in addition. We, therefore, see no force in the first\n contention raised by the learned counsel and reject the same.\n\n 5. We see considerable force in the second contention raised by the\n learned counsel for the petitioners. The reservations provided\n under the impugned Government instructions are to be\n operated in accordance with the roster to be maintained in\n each Department. The roster is implemented in the form of\n running account from year to year. The purpose of \"running\n account\" is to make sure that the Scheduled Castes/Schedule\n Tribes and Backward Classes get their percentage of reserved\n posts. The concept of \"running account\" in the impugned\n instructions has to be so interpreted that it does not result in\n excessive reservation. \"16% of the posts ...\" are reserved for\n members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes. In a lot of\n 100 posts those falling at Serial Numbers 1, 7, 15, 22, 30, 37, 44, 51,\n 58, 65, 72, 80, 87 and 91 have been reserved and earmarked in the\n roster for the Scheduled Castes. Roster points 26 and 76 are reserved\n for the members of Backward Classes. It is thus obvious that when\n recruitment to a cadre starts then 14 posts earmarked in the roster are\n to be filled from amongst the members of the Scheduled Castes. To\n illustrate, first post in a cadre must go to the Scheduled Caste and\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 56\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n thereafter the said class is entitled to 7th, 15th, 22nd and onwards up\n to 91st post. When the total number of posts in a cadre are filled by\n the operation of the roster then the result envisaged by the impugned\n instructions is achieved. In other words, in a cadre of 100 posts when\n the posts earmarked in the roster for the Scheduled Castes and the\n Backward Classes are filled the percentage of reservation provided for\n the reserved categories is achieved. We see no justification to operate\n the roster thereafter. The \"running account\" is to operate only till\n the quota provided under the impugned instructions is reached\n and not thereafter. Once the prescribed percentage of posts is\n filled the numerical test of adequacy is satisfied and thereafter\n the roster does not survive. The percentage of reservation is the\n desired representation of the Backward Classes in the State\n Services and is consistent with the demographic estimate\n based on the proportion worked out in relation to their\n population. The numerical quota of posts is not a shifting\n boundary but represents a figure with due application of mind.\n Therefore, the only way to assure equality of opportunity to the\n Backward Classes and the general category is to permit the\n roster to operate till the time the respective\n appointees/promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the\n roster. The operation of the roster and the \"running account\" must\n come to an end thereafter. The vacancies arising in the cadre, after the\n initial posts are filled, will pose no difficulty. As and when there is a\n vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post\n the same has to be filled from amongst the category to which\n the post belonged in the roster. For example the Scheduled Caste\n persons holding the posts at roster points 1, 7, 15 retire then these\n slots are to be filled from amongst the persons belonging to the\n Scheduled Castes. Similarly, if the persons holding the post at points 8\n to 14 or 23 to 29 retire then these slots are to be filled from among the\n general category. By following this procedure there shall neither\n be shortfall nor excess in the percentage of reservation.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\nC.

However, in this case, as stated above, the main issue\n concerns the \"extent of reservation\". In this regard the State\n concerned will have to show in each case the existence of the\n compelling reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of\n representation and overall administrative efficiency before\n making provision for reservation. As stated above, the\n impugned provision is an enabling provision. The State is not\n bound to make reservation for SCs/STs in matters of\n promotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion\n and make such provision, the State has to collect quantifiable\n data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of\n representation of that class in public employment in addition\n to compliance with \nArticle 335.\n It is made clear that even if the\n State has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State will\n have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to\n excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of 50% or\n obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation\n indefinitely.\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 58\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n 124.

After considering the issue identified by the learned\n Attorney General and other learned counsel and hearing them, the\n following six points are formulated for determination:\n\n 11.1 (1) What is the yardstick by which, according to M.\n Nagraj, one would arrive at quantifiable data showing\n inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in public\n employment?\n\n 11.2(2) What is the unit with respect to which quantifiable\n data showing inadequacy of representation is required to be\n collected?\n\n 11.3(3) Whether proportion of the population of SCs and STs\n to the population of India should be taken to be the test for\n determining adequacy of representation in promotional\n posts for the purpose of \nArticle 16(4-A)?\n\n 11.4(4) Should there be a time period for reviewing inadequacy of\n prospectively?\n\n 11.5(5) Whether the judgment in M.Nagraj can be said to\n operate prospectively?\n\n 11.6 (6) Whether quantifiable data showing inadequacy of\n representation can be collected on the basis of sampling\n methods, as held by this Court in B.K. Pavitra vs. Union of\n India [B.K. Pavitra].\"\n\n (1) Yardstick for arriving at quantifiable data\n\n \n17. Determination of inadequate representation of SCs and STs in\n services under a State is left to the discretion of the State, as the\n determination depends upon myriad factors which this Court\n cannot envisage. A conscious decision was taken by this Court\n in \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC\n 212 : (\n2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] and Jarnail Singh [Jarnail\n Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta\n, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019)\n 1 SCC (L&S) 86] to leave it to the States to fix the criteria for\n determining inadequacy of representation.\n \nThe submission of\n the learned Attorney General for India that this Court has to lay\n down the yardstick for measuring adequacy of representation did\n not yield a favourable result as this Court in Jarnail Singh [Jarnail\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 60\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\nSingh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta\n, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC\n (L&S) 86] found it befitting for the States to have the liberty to\n evaluate the representation of SCs and STs in public employment.\n Laying down of criteria for determining the inadequacy of\n representation would result in curtailing the discretion\n given to the State Governments. In addition, the prevailing\n local conditions, which may require to be factored in, might\n not be uniform.\n \nMoreover, in \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union\n of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court\n made it clear that the validity of law made by the State\n Governments providing reservation in promotions shall be decided\n on a case-to-case basis for the purpose of establishing whether the\n inadequacy of representation is supported by quantifiable data.\n Therefore, we are of the opinion that no yardstick can be\n \nlaid down by\n this Court for determining the adequacy of\n representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts for the\n purpose of providing reservation.\n\n (2) Unit for collecting quantifiable data\n\n 21. \nIn \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :\n\n (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court observed that the appropriate\n Government has to apply cadre strength as a unit in the operation\n of the roster in order to ascertain whether a given class/group is\n adequately represented in the service. Cadre strength as a unit\n also ensures that the upper ceiling limit of 50% is not violated.\n\n \nFollowing the law \nlaid down in\n \nR.K. Sabharwal [R.K.\n Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n, (1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S)\n 548] , this Court in \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006)\n 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] further held that the roster\n has to be post-specific and not vacancy based.\n\n 22. \nIn \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :\n\n \n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court held that it is open to the\n State to provide for reservation in promotions subject to limitation\n that there must exist compelling reasons for backwardness,\n inadequacy of representation in a class of post(s) keeping in mind\n the overall administrative efficiency. While referring to the roster,\n this Court observed that the appropriate Government has to apply\n the cadre strength as a unit in the operation of the roster in order to\n ascertain whether a given class/group is adequately represented\n in the service. Collection of quantifiable data regarding inadequacy\n of representation as stipulated by \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union\n of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] is relatable\n to the cadre concerned, according to \nJarnail Singh [Jarnail\n Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta\n, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC\n (L&S) 86] .\n\n 36. \nIn \nR.K. Sabharwal [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n, (1995) 2\n SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] , this Court held that the right to\n be considered for appointment can only be claimed in respect of a\n post in a cadre and that the concept of \"vacancy\" has no relevance\n in operating the percentage of reservation. It was further held that\n the cadre strength is always measured by the number of posts\n comprising the cadre.\n\n 38. In the Office Memorandum dated 2-7-1997, the Union of India\n set out the principles for making and operating post-based rosters,\n in which it has been expressly stated that cadre is to be construed\n as the number of posts in a particular grade. It is made clear that\n rosters have been prepared grade-wise which are reviewed on a\n yearly basis and that reservation in promotions is implemented on\n the basis of these rosters, which operate grade-wise. \nIn \nM.\n Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1\n SCC (L&S) 1013] , this Court approved that the percentage of\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 61\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n reservation in promotions was to be applied to the entire cadre\n strength, as held in \nR.K. Sabharwal [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of\n Punjab\n, (1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] .\n \nWhile doing so,\n this Court in \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8\n SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] made it clear that the unit for\n operation of the roster would be the cadre strength. Before\n providing for reservation in promotions to a cadre, the State is\n obligated to collect quantifiable data regarding inadequacy of\n representation of SCs and STs. Collection of information regarding\n inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs cannot be with\n reference to the entire service or \"class\"/\"group\" but it should be\n relatable to the grade/category of posts to which promotion is\n sought. Cadre, which should be the unit for the purpose of\n collection of quantifiable data in relation to the promotional post(s),\n would be meaningless if data pertaining to representation of SCs\n and STs is with reference to the entire service.\"\n\n (3) Proportionate representation as test of adequacy\n\n 39. \nIn \nR.K. Sabharwal [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n, (1995) 2\n SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] , it was observed that State\n Governments may take the total population of a particular\n Backward Class and its representation in the State services for the\n purpose of coming to a conclusion that there is inadequate\n representation in the State services.\n\n \n41. This Court in \nJarnail Singh [Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi\n Narain Gupta\n, (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC (L&S) 86]\n found no fault with \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n,\n (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] regarding the\n test for determining the adequacy of representation in\n promotional posts in the State. While emphasising the\n contrast in the language used between \nArticle 330\n and\n \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n of the Constitution, this Court\n declined the invitation of the learned Attorney General for\n India to hold that the proportion of SCs and STs to the\n population of India should be the test for determining\n inadequacy of representation in promotional posts.\n Therefore, we are not persuaded to express any opinion on\n this aspect. It is for the State to assess the inadequacy of\n representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts, by\n taking into account relevant factors.\n\n (4) Time period for review\n\n \n43. We are not inclined to express any view on discontinuation of\n reservations in totality, which is completely within the domain of\n the legislature and the executive. As regards review, we are of the\n opinion that data collected to determine inadequacy of\n representation for the purpose of providing reservation in\n promotions needs to be reviewed periodically. The period for review\n should be reasonable and is left to the Government to set out.\n (5) Prospective operation of the judgment in \nM. Nagaraj [M.\n Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC\n (L&S) 1013]\n\n \n45. This Court upheld the validity of \nArticle 16(4-A)\n in \nM.\n Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1\n SCC (L&S) 1013] on 19-10-2006 and observed that reservation in\n promotions in public services can be made, subject to collection of\n quantifiable data by the State showing backwardness of the class\n and inadequacy of representation of that class in public\n employment, in addition to compliance with \nArticle 335\n of the\n Constitution. Reservation in promotions provided by various State\n Governments and the Central Government have been challenged in\n the High Courts on the ground of non-compliance with the\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 62\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\n requirement of collection of quantifiable data showing\n backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation.\n \nIt is\n relevant to mention at this stage that collection of\n quantifiable data regarding backwardness of SCs and STs is\n no more required in view of the judgment of this Court\n in \nJarnail Singh [Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi Narain Gupta\n,\n (2018) 10 SCC 396 : (2019) 1 SCC (L&S) 86] . In respect of the\n data relating to inadequacy of representation of SCs and\n STs, the High Courts have adjudicated writ petitions which\n are the subject-matter of special leave petitions pending in\n this Court.\n\n \n62. This Court in \nGolak Nath [Golak Nath v. State of Punjab\n, (1967)\n 2 SCR 762 : AIR 1967 SC 1643] and Ashok Kumar Gupta [Ashok\n Kumar Gupta v. State of U.P., (1997) 5 SCC 201 : 1997 SCC (L&S)\n 1299] , referred to above, has laid down that \nArticle 142\n empowers\n this Court to mould the relief to do complete justice.\n \nTo conclude\n this point, the purpose of holding that \nM. Nagaraj [M.\n Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC\n (L&S) 1013] would have prospective effect is only to avoid\n chaos and confusion that would ensue from its retrospective\n operation, as it would have a debilitating effect on a very\n large number of employees, who may have availed of\n reservation in promotions without there being strict\n compliance of the conditions prescribed in \nM. Nagaraj [M.\n Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC\n (L&S) 1013] . Most of them would have already retired from\n service on attaining the age of superannuation.\n \nThe judgment\n of \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212\n : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] was delivered in 2006,\n interpreting \nArticle 16(4-A)\n of the Constitution which came\n into force in 1995.\n \nAs making the principles \nlaid down in\n \nM.\n Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212 :\n\n \n(2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] effective from the year 1995 would\n be detrimental to the interests of a number of civil servants\n and would have an effect of unsettling the seniority of\n individuals over a long period of time, it is necessary that\n the judgment of \nM. Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n,\n (2006) 8 SCC 212 : (2007) 1 SCC (L&S) 1013] should be\n declared to have prospective effect.\"\n\n \n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n Their Lordships in case of \nJarnail Singh\n (2) (supra)\n directed the Union of India to give particulars about\n contemporaneous cadre wise data, considered for\n determination of inadequacy of representation of SCs and\n STs for providing reservation in promotions and further\n observed that it will be open to the authorities to\n undertake the exercise in terms of the judgment titled\n \nJarnail Singh vs. Lachhmi Narain Gupta & Ors.\n (2022)\n 10 SCC 595.\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 63\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\nI. The Seven-Judge Constitution Bench judgment in case\n\nof \nState of Punjab & Ors. vs. Davinder Singh & Ors\n, reported\nin (2025) 1 SCC 1.

Chinnaiah\n (supra) requires to be reconsidered\nsince the High Court had held that the Punjab Act and Haryana\nNotifications (by which Scheduled Castes in the State were\nclassified into two categories, A & B for the purposes of\nreservation in direct recruitment for government jobs within\nquota reserved for SCs) were unconstitutional solely being\ncontrary to law \nlaid down in\n case of \nE.V.

Clause (4) of \nArticle 16\n contains an enabling provision to\nempower the State to make reservation in appointment or posts\nin favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion\nof State is not adequately represented in the service under the\nState. Clause (4-A) has enabling provision and empowers the\nappropriate Government/executives to provide for reservation in\npromotion with consequential seniority in posts or classes of\nposts in service under State in favour of SCs and STs. Clause\n(4-A) of \nArticle 16\n also provides \"which in the opinion of the State\nare not adequately represented in the service under the\nappropriate Government\".\n\n17. Their Lordships in \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) held that the\nopinion of the appropriate Government/executive on the factors\ndetermining the adequacy of representation of SCs and STs in\nthe public services of the State is a matter which forms a part of\nsubjective satisfaction of the State and also emphasized that\nwhen an authority is vested with the power to form an opinion,\nit is not open for the Courts to substitute its own opinion for\nthat of authority, nor can the opinion of the authority be\nchallenged on grounds of propriety or sufficiency.\n\n18. \nIn \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) Their Lordships dealing with the\nparameters governing the assessment of the adequacy of\nrepresentation or of the impact on efficiency of administration.\nTheir Lordships in para 45, 49 and 102 held that it is the State\nwho is in the best position to define and measure merit in\nwhatever ways it to be relevant to public employment and\nreservation in \nArticle 16(4)\n and \nArticle 16(4-A)\n is enabling and\ndiscretion is to be subjective satisfaction of the existence of\nbackwardness, inadequacy of representation in public\nemployment and the inadequacy has to exist factually. Their\nLordships also held in para 49 that the inadequacy has to\nfactually exist and resultantly now judicial review comes in.\nTheir Lordships further emphasized that however, whether\nreservation in a given case is desirable or not, as a policy is not\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 65\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\nfor the courts to decide as long as parameters mentioned in\n\nArticle 16(4)\n and \n16(4-A)\n are maintained. The five-Judge\nConstitution Bench held that \nArticle 16(4-A)\n is an enabling\nprovision and the State/executive is not bound to make\nreservation for SCs and STs in promotions, but if it decides to\nimplement reservation in promotion, it must collect quantifiable\ndata on three factors (i) the backwardness of class; (ii) the\ninadequacy of the representation of that class in public\nemployment; and (iii) the general efficiency of service as\nmandated by \nArticle 335\n would not be affected.\n \nThe aforesaid\nprinciples governing enabling provision is expressly evident\nfrom dictum in the constitution Bench decision in \nM.

So far as the issue related to the concept of creamy layer\n\nwhether applicable to the SCs and STs. The Tribunal is bound\n\nby the nine-Judge Bench judgment of the Constitution Bench in\n\ncase of \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) and followed in case of \nM.\n\nNagaraj\n (supra) clarified in \nJarnail Singh\n (2) (supra).\n \nTheir\n\nLordships clearly held in majority in \nIndra Sawhney\n (1) (supra)\n\nin paragraph 792 that the test or requirement of social and\n\neducational backwardness cannot be applied to SCs and STs\n\nwhen individually fall within the express Backward Classes of\n\nCitizens and SCs and STs are a separate class by themselves\n\nand creamy layer principle is not applicable in the incident of\n\npromotion and protection of consequential seniority also an\n\nincidence of service as to incidence of promotion.\n\n27.1 Their Lordships in case of \nB.K.

Union of India\n, reported in (2019) 16 SCC 129 in\n\nparagraph 138 to 148 has also dealt the issue related to concept\n\nof creamy layer in reservation in promotion to SCs and STs and\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 75\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\nHon'ble Court examined in light of the nine-Judge Bench\n\ndecision of majority in Indra Sawhney (1) and also in case of \nM.\n\nNagaraj\n (supra) and in paragraph 148 held as under:-\n\n \"148.......This being the true constitutional position, the\n protection of consequential seniority as an incident of\n promotion of the creamy layer test. \nArticles 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-\n B)\n were held to not obliterate any of the constitutional\n limitations and to fulfill the width test. In the above view of\n the matter, it is evident that the concept of creamy layer has\n no application in assessing the validity of the Reservation\n Act, 2018 which is designed to protect consequential\n seniority upon promotion of persons belonging to the SCs and\n STs.\"\n\n \n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n27.2 Thus, having considered and of the opinion that\n\nprinciples \nlaid down by\n \nIndra Sawhney\n (supra) on exclusion of\n\ncreamy layer apply only to OBCs and not been extended to SCs\n\nand STs.\n \nSo also no question arose in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) on\n\nexclusion of creamy layer in respect of SCs and STs. Their\n\nLordships in the constitution Bench decision in case of Jarnail\n\nSingh (1) dealt with competence of the Parliament to enact a\n\nlaw in relation to creamy layer and did not lay down preposition\n\non its exclusion.\n\n CONSEQUENTIAL SENIORITY\n\n28. \nIn case of \nJarnail Singh\n (2) (supra), Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt has given guidelines to implement mandate of \nArticle\n16(4)\n, 16(4-A)\n and \n16(4-B)\n of the Constitution of India.\n\nUndisputedly, the post based roster is being maintained in the\nmanner of filling up of the posts in promotion also as prescribed\nby constitution Bench decision in \nR.K. Sabharwal\n (supra).\n \nThe\nquantifiable data to be collected based in the cadre as per post\nthe post based roster maintained as \nlaid down in\n para 121 of\nthe dictum in the case of \nM.Nagaraj\n (supra) and clarified in\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 76\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\npara 17-18 of \nJarnail Singh\n (2) (supra). The cadre has been\nheld to be the unit and the quantifiable data in possession with\nthe respondents. The respondents are maintaining post based\nroster as per mandate of Hon'ble Supreme Court and the\napplicants have failed to challenge the promotion orders in the\ncadre of Superintendent. The executives/Union or State has the\nrequisite data and sufficient material to determine inadequacy\nof representation for SCs and STs to be analysed in the cadre.\n\nThe Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001\n came into\neffect from 17.06.1995 to grant consequential benefits on\npromotion to SCs and STs as to consequential seniority on their\npromotion on the basis of rule of reservation following mandate\nof \nM.Nagaraj\n (supra) and \nR.K. Sabharwal\n (supra), the\nimpugned draft seniority list of Superintendent, Mumbai Zone\nas on 01.01.2019 had been issued and the zone of\nconsideration for promotion to the post of Assistant\nCommissioner also based on seniority list of feeder cadre of\nSuperintendents as on for period 1986-92 for CX, for period\n1993-97 for CX and for period 1998-2006 for CP, for period\nfrom 1.8.1994 and for CA for period 1.4.1997 to 31.12.2002 as\nevident from Annexure R-6 and dictum in \nM. Nagaraj\n (supra) is\napplicable prospectively. The amendment to \nArticle 16 (4-A)\n is to\nprovide consequential seniority in case of promotion by virtue of\nrule of reservation. The words \"in the matters of promotion, with\nconsequential seniority to any class\" were substituted in clause\n(4-A) of \nArticle 16\n for words \"in matters of the promotion to any\nclass\".\n \nThe \nArticle 16(4-A)\n vested the consequential seniority on\npromotion to reserved category candidates fulfilling data\nrequirement to determine adequacy in the cadre specific based\non the post based roster and dictum of \nM.Nagaraj\n (supra).\n \nSo\nalso OM dated 21.01.2002, seniority of SC/ST on promotion by\nvirtue of reservation and clarified by \nJarnail Singh\n (2) (supra).\n\nTheir Lordships in case of B.K. Pavitra (2) (supra) has held\nthat reservation adopts the principle that consequential\n\nNARESH NARESH\nKUMAR KUMAR AHUJA\n 2025.09.16\n AHUJA 11:28:44+05'30'\n\n 77\n\n OA No.407/2020\n\nseniority is not an additional benefit but an incidence and\nconsequence of the promotion which is granted to SCs and STs.\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n29. For all the reasons stated supra and having considered\nquantifiable data to determine adequacy of representation in the\ncadre and benchmark for suitability is same for all, hence the\nissue is decided in favour of the respondents and against the\napplicants. I concur with the conclusion arrived at by Hon'ble\nMember (Judicial) that the applicants are not entitled for the\nrelief sought in OA No.407/2020.\n\n30.

The concept of \"running account\" in the impugned\n instructions has to be so interpreted that it does not result in\n excessive reservation. \"16% of the posts ...\" are reserved for\n members of the Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes. In a lot of\n 100 posts those falling at Serial Numbers 1, 7, 15, 22, 30, 37, 44, 51,\n 58, 65, 72, 80, 87 and 91 have been reserved and earmarked in the\n roster for the Scheduled Castes. Roster points 26 and 76 are reserved\n for the members of Backward Classes. It is thus obvious that when\n recruitment to a cadre starts then 14 posts earmarked in the roster are\n to be filled from amongst the members of the Scheduled Castes. To\n illustrate, first post in a cadre must go to the Scheduled Caste and"

When the total number of posts in a cadre are filled by\n the operation of the roster then the result envisaged by the impugned\n instructions is achieved. In other words, in a cadre of 100 posts when\n the posts earmarked in the roster for the Scheduled Castes and the\n Backward Classes are filled the percentage of reservation provided for\n the reserved categories is achieved. We see no justification to operate\n the roster thereafter. The \"running account\" is to operate only till\n the quota provided under the impugned instructions is reached\n and not thereafter. Once the prescribed percentage of posts is\n filled the numerical test of adequacy is satisfied and thereafter\n the roster does not survive. The percentage of reservation is the\n desired representation of the Backward Classes in the State\n Services and is consistent with the demographic estimate\n based on the proportion worked out in relation to their\n population. The numerical quota of posts is not a shifting\n boundary but represents a figure with due application of mind.\n Therefore, the only way to assure equality of opportunity to the\n Backward Classes and the general category is to permit the\n roster to operate till the time the respective\n appointees/promotees occupy the posts meant for them in the\n roster. The operation of the roster and the \"running account\" must\n come to an end thereafter. The vacancies arising in the cadre, after the\n initial posts are filled, will pose no difficulty. As and when there is a\n vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post\n the same has to be filled from amongst the category to which\n the post belonged in the roster. For example the Scheduled Caste\n persons holding the posts at roster points 1, 7, 15 retire then these\n slots are to be filled from amongst the persons belonging to the\n Scheduled Castes. Similarly, if the persons holding the post at points 8\n to 14 or 23 to 29 retire then these slots are to be filled from among the\n general category. By following this procedure there shall neither\n be shortfall nor excess in the percentage of reservation.\""
