Vs. Aditya Kumar Chatterjee2\n.\n\n2. This enigma is placed before me through the present\ncase, where the counter arguments are advanced on issue,\nwhether prescription of mere, 'venue' in the arbitration clause\ncontained in the 'Lease Agreement' would confer jurisdiction\non this Court to appoint an Arbitrator, as prayed in the\napplication, particularly when the subject matter of the suit\nwould fall outside the jurisdiction of this Court.\n\n3. The applicant before me is a Private Limited Company,\nregistered under the provisions of the \nCompanies Act\n, inter\nalia, engaged in the business of manufacturing of Mustard oil,\nhaving it's plant at Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The respondent is\nalso engaged in the business of production, processing and\npreservation of edible oil.\n\n The applicant and the respondent entered into a Lease\nAgreement on 01/04/2019, wherein the Mustard Oil Plant\nbelonging to the applicant, and located in Rajasthan was leased\nout to the respondent, by executing a Lease Agreement in\nIndore (State of Madhya Pradesh).\n\n The Lease Agreement executed on 01/04/2019, expired\non 31/03/2020 and the respondent came with an offer to\nextend the arrangement for a further period of seven years.\n\n2 2022 SCC OnLine SC 568\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 3/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nCorrespondence was exchanged between the parties for\nextension of the existing Lease and, ultimately on October 20,\n2020, the Lease Agreement was renewed and it became\neffective from 01/01/2021, where the monthly license rental\nwas agreed at Rs.3,00,000/- per month. However, the Lessor\nsought to terminate the said Agreement, by issuing a notice of\ntermination to the respondent, as contemplated in the Lease\nAgreement, by seeking vacant peaceful possession of it's\nmanufacturing plant, failing which it was notifed that the\nrespondent is liable to pay rent of Rs.15,00,000/- per month.\n\n This notice was contested by submitting that the\ntermination is illegal and not binding. The notice period\nexpired on September 19, 2021 and on 13/10/2021, the\napplicant forwarded a notice for termination of the Lease\nAgreement and invoked arbitration on 24/11/2021 as per\nclause 20 of the Lease Agreement. The respondent con tested\nthe invocation of arbitration, by submitting it's reply.\n\n4. Since the disputes arose between the applicant and the\nrespondent, out of the Lease Agreement, which comprised of\nclause for referring the disputes for arbitration and since the\nparties failed to reach a consensus to negotiate the arbitration\nproceedings, within 30 days of the invocation notice, the\napplicant has approached this Court, with a request to\nexercise the power of the Court under sub-section (6) of\nSection 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for\nshort, \"The Act of 1996\")\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 4/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n5.

The learned counsel for the applicant would justify the\nrelief, for appointment of a sole Arbitrator, at the hands of this\nCourt, by relying upon the following decisions of the Apex\nCourt, which according to him, has sealed the position of law,\nto the effect that the seat of arbitration is it's centre of gravity,\nas \nlaid down by\n the Constitution Bench in the case of BALCO\n(supra). Reliance is placed particularly on paragraphs 96 to\n98 of the law report.\n\n \nReliance is also placed upon the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of \nBrahmani River Pellets Limited Vs.\nKamachi Industries Limited3\n , where once again the party\nautonomy contemplated under \nSection 20\n of the Act of 1996,\ncame to be recognised and it was held that the intention of the\nparties to confer jurisdiction upon a particular Court would be\nindicative of implied exclusion of jurisdiction of other Courts.\n\n According to the learned counsel, it was held in the facts\nof the case that when the parties have agreed that the 'venue'\nof arbitration shall be at Bhubaneshwar, the intention of the\nparties is to exclude all other Courts and, therefore, it was held\nthat the Madras High Court has erred in assuming the\n\n3 (2020) 5 SCC 462\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 5/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\njurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act of 1996, since only\nthe Orissa High Court could have entertained the application\nfled under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act.\n\n7. Further the learned counsel Mr.Chandran would press\ninto service the decision of Three-Judge Bench of the Apex\nCourt in the case of BGS SGS Soma JV Vs.NHPC Limited 4,\nwhere the concept of 'seat' was once again focused upon and in\nthe background facts, it was specifcally held as under:-\n\n \"wherever there is a expressed designation of a 'venue' and no\n designation of any alternative place as the 'seat', combined\n with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration\n and no other signifcant, contrary indicia, the inexorable\n conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical\n seat of the arbitral proceedings\".\n\n By gainfully relying upon the observations in the law\nreport, where it was concluded that when both the parties\nhave chosen the Court at New Delhi to have exclusive\njurisdiction, the fact that the part of cause of action may have\narisen in Faridabad, was held to be of no relevance.\n\n \nReliance is also placed upon \nMankastu Impex Private\nLimited Vs. Airvisual Limited5\n, where the shashoua test was\nreiterated, by relying upon the decision in the case of BGS SGS\nSoma JV (supra).\n\n \nThe decision of the learned single Judge of this Court in\nthe case of \nPriya Malay Sheth Vs.

The respondent resisted the application, seeking\nappointment of a sole Arbitrator, by contesting the same on\ntwo counts, the frst being that the Lease Agreement is\ninsuffciently stamped and also on the ground of lack of\njurisdiction in this Court to entertain the application, as\naccording to the learned counsel Mr.Vaishnav for the\nrespondent, the Lease Agreement comprise of a clause, under\nwhich, it is agreed that 'venue' of arbitration shall be Mumbai,\nbut Mumbai was never intended to be a 'seat' of arbitration.\nIt is sought to be argued that the claims sought to be projected\nbefore the Arbitral Tribunal is for recovery of possession /\neviction of the respondent from the Mustard oil plant, which is\nsituated in Ganganagar, and since, the Lease Agreement is\nexecuted in Indore (State of Madhya Pradesh), this Court\nwould not exercise jurisdiction, as it is not a Court, as defned\nunder \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the Act of 1996.\n\n The proposition propounded by the learned counsel, by\nrelying upon the authoritative pronouncements of the highest\nCourt of the country is, the term 'seat' and 'venue' have\ndifferent connotations and cannot be used interchangeably.\nReliance is also placed upon the Constitution Bench decision\nin the case of BALCO (supra) to bolster his argument that it\nhas been categorically held by the Apex Court that the terms\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 7/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n'seat' and 'venue' have different meanings and these two\nterms cannot be used interchangeably.\n\n \nThe learned counsel would further submit that Law\nCommission of India in it's 246th report gave a suggestion for\nsubstituting the term 'place', in \nsection 20(2)\n with 'seat' and in\n\nsection 20(3)\n with 'venue'. However, these changes are not\nimplemented in the 2015 Amendment and the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in \nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\nVs. Datawind Innovations Private Limited & Ors.\n 7, has\ncategorically observed that such amendment was unnecessary\nin view of the BALCO (supra) judgment and it was noted that\nthe Law Commission specifcally adverted to the difference\nbetween 'seat' and 'venue' and has recommended so, but the\namended Act does not contain the above amendments.\n\nPresumably the BALCO (supra) in no uncertain terms has\nreferred to 'place' as 'juridical' seat for the purposes of \nSection\n2(2)\n of the Act. It further made it clear that \nSection 20(1)\n\nand \nSection 20(2)\n, where the word 'place' is used refers to\njurisdictional seat whereas in \nSection 20(3)\n, the word 'place' is\nequivalent to 'venue'. This being the settled law, it was found\nunnecessary to expressly interpret what the Constitution\nBench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has already done by way\nof construction of the Act.\n\n9. The learned counsel, in support of the case of the\nrespondent, also placed reliance upon the decision of the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of Mankastu Impex Private\n\n7 2017(7) SCC 678\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 8/42 \nCARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nLimited\n (supra) and, in particular, on the following\nobservation :-\n\n \"20. It is well-settled that \"seat of arbitration\" and \"venue of\n arbitration\" cannot be used inter-changeably. It has also been\n established that mere expression \"place of arbitration\" cannot\n be the basis to determine the intention of the parties that they\n have intended that place as the \"seat\" of arbitration. The\n intention of the parties as to the \"seat\" should be determined\n from other clauses in the agreement and the conduct of the\n parties.\"\n\n10. The learned counsel would strenuously rely upon the\ndecision of the Apex Court in the case of \nRavi Ranjan\n (supra),\nwhere the question arose, whether the Calcutta High Court has\njurisdiction to pass an order appointing the Arbitrator in the\ncase, where the parties executed the Development Agreement\nfor a property situated at Muzaffarpur, Bihar and also\nregistered the Agreement in Muzaffarpur, but the arbitration\nclause provided that the seat of the Tribunal 'shall be at\nKolkata'.\n\n While allowing the Appeals, the Apex Court has, inter\nalia, observed that, Kolkata was only the venue for holding the\nseating of the Tribunal and 'venue' does not indicate the 'seat',\nsince particularly, when no agreement was arrived between\nthe parties, to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the\nCourt in Calcutta, which was only intended to be the 'venue'. It\nwas, therefore, held that Calcutta High Court lacks the\njurisdiction to entertain an application under \nSection 11(6)\n of\nthe Act of 1996 and it was held that an application cannot be\nmoved in any High Court in India, unmindful of the territorial\njurisdiction.\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 9/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n The learned counsel would submit that it has been\nspecifcally held, by the Two-Judge Bench of the Apex Court\nthat \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act of 1996 has to be harmoniously\nread with \nSection 2(1)(e)\n and construed to mean a High Court,\nwhich exercises superintendence/supervisory jurisdiction\nover a Court within the meaning of \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the Act.\n\n11.

Before I proceed to deal with the rival contentions to\nascertain whether, this Court would be in a position to exercise\nit's power for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of clause\n20 of the Lease Agreement, it would be apposite to reproduce\nthe arbitration clause contained in the Agreement, which\nreads thus :-\n\n8 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 493\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 10/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n \"In case of any dispute/difference arising out of this\n agreement, the same shall be referred to the sole Arbitrator to\n be appointed by the Lessee in consultation and approval with\n the Lessor.

The statutory scheme compiled in the Act of 1996\nprovide for appointment of an Arbitrator by the Court, when\nthe circumstances enumerated in \nSection 11\n of the Act of\n1996, come into foreplay and in particular, where the parties\nto an agreement fail to arrive at the consensus regarding the\nappointment of the Arbitrator, and as contemplated by the\nappointment procedure agreed between the parties, one party\nfails to act as required or the parties or the two appointed\narbitrators fail to reach an agreement expected of them, or\nunder the procedure, a person, including an institution, fails to\nperform any function entrusted to him or it, on a request by\nthe parties, the High Court or the Supreme Court, as the case\nmay be, take such necessary measures as are warranted.\n\n14. \nThe Act\n of 1996 has defned certain terms and in \nSection\n2\n, the term 'Court' is defned as under :-\n\n \"(e) \"Court\" means-\n\n (i) in the case of an arbitration other than intentional\n commercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of original\n jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in\n exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having\n jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject-matter\n of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-matter of a\n suit, but does not include any Civil Court of a grade inferior to\n such principal Civil Court, or any Court of Small Causes;\n\n (ii) in the case of international commercial arbitration,\n the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil\n jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 11/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had\n been the subject-matter of a suit, and in other cases, a High\n Court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of\n Courts subordinate to that High Court.\"\n\n15. \nSection 20\n of the Act specify the place of arbitration and\nthe relevant Section reads thus :-\n\n \"20.

The place of arbitration in terms of \nSection 20\n may thus\neither refer to 'seat' or 'venue' and the legislature has carefully\nchosen not to apply the term, 'venue' or 'seat', but instead it\nhas used th e term 'place of arbitration'.\n\n The term 'place of arbitration' itself carries two distinct\nmeanings; \nSection 20(1)\n and \n20(2)\n signifying the seat of\narbitration, whereas notwithstanding sub-section (1) and (2)\nof \nSection 20\n, any indication to the location, as distinct from\nthe seat, where the Arbitral Tribunal would conduct it's\nproceedings, signifying the geographical location.\n\n Despite the importance of choice of a 'seat' in arbitration\nproceedings, it being a juridical concept, the arbitration\nagreements often apply the terms 'seat', 'venue' or 'place'\ninter-changeably and in such situation, it is left either to the\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 13/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nCourt or Arbitral Tribunal to determine, which place would\namount to 'seat' of the arbitration.\n\n18. Indian jurisprudence on the subject of arbitration,\nundisputedly has witnessed divergent use, with regard to it's\nvarious fascets, including the subject-matter of arbitrability of\nthe dispute and the fne line of distinction between 'seat' and\n'venue'. Through various binding precedents, the highest\nCourt of this country, the Hon'ble Apex Court and various High\nCourts assigned distinct connotation to the term 'seat', 'venue',\n'place', but it was the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in\nthe case of BALCO (supra) examined the concept of 'seat' and\n'venue' and deduced an inference that they are distinct. It\noffered a clarifcation that although the arbitration\nproceedings may take place anywhere in the world, the seat of\nthose proceedings is located at a specifc Arbitral institution\nsuch as international commercial Court or another similar\nauthority, whereas the venue where the meetings are held,\nwould only refer to any geographical area, within which the\nparty can negotiate.\n\n19. The conundrum between the 'seat' and the 'venue'\nexpressedly featured in the case of BALCO (supra) before a\nConstitution Bench of the Apex Court, and in paragraph 75,\nTheir Lordships turned down the argument advanced, that Act\nof 1996 does not make seat of the arbitration as the centre of\ngravity and observed as under :-\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 14/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n \"75. We are also unable to accept the submission of the\n learned counsel for the appellants that the \nArbitration Act,\n 1996\n does not make seat of the arbitration as the centre of\n gravity of the arbitration. On the contrary, it is accepted by\n most of the experts that in most of the national laws,\n arbitrations are anchored to the seat/place/situs of\n arbitration. Redfern in Paragraph 3.54 concludes states that\n \"the seat of the arbitration is thus intended to be its centre of\n gravity.\" This, however, does not mean that all the\n proceedings of the arbitration have to take place at the seat of\n the arbitration. The arbitrators at times hold meetings at\n more convenient locations. This is necessary as arbitrators\n often come from different countries. It may, therefore, on\n occasions be convenient to hold some of the meetings in a\n location which may be convenient to all. Such a situation was\n examined by the court of appeal in England in Naviera\n Amazonica Peruana S.A. Vs. Compania Internacionale de\n Seguros del Peru wherein at p.121 it is observed as follows :\n\n \"The preceding discussion has been on the basis that\n there is only one \"place\" of arbitration.

This does not mean, however, that the\n arbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings\n at the place of arbitration. International commercial\n arbitration often involves people of many different\n nationalities, from many different countries. In these\n circumstances, it is by no means unusual for an\n arbitral tribunal to hold meetings or even hearings in a\n place other than the designated place of arbitration,\n either for its own convenience or for the convenience of\n the parties or their witnesses...... It may be more\n convenient for an arbitral tribunal sitting in one\n country to conduct a hearing in another country, for\n instance, for the purpose of taking evidence..... In fact\n circumstances each move of the arbitral tribunal does\n not of itself mean that the seat of arbitration changes.\n The seat of arbitration remains the place initially\n agreed by or on behalf of the parties.\"\n\nParagraph 76, further recorded as under :-\n\n \"76.

It is true that the terms \"seat\" and \"place\" are often\n used interchangeably. In Redfern and Hunter on International\n Arbitration, 5th Edn. (para 3.51), the seat theory is defned\n thus: \"The concept that an arbitration is governed by the law\n of the place in which it is held, which is the 'seat' (or 'forum'\n or locus arbitri) of the arbitration, is well established in both\n the theory and practice of international arbitration. In fact,\n the 1923 Geneva Protocol states:\n\n \"2. The arbitral procedure, including the constitution of\n the arbitral tribunal, shall be governed by the will of the\n parties and by the law of the country in whose territory the\n arbitration takes place.\"\n\n20. Dealing with the defnition of the term \"Court\", in\nparagraph 96, the Constitution Bench has remarked as\nunder :-\n\n \"96. .....\n\n We are of the opinion, the term \"subject-matter of the\n arbitration\" cannot be confused with \"subject-matter of the\n suit\". The term \"subject-matter\" in \nSection 2(1)(e)\n is confned\n to Part I. It has a reference and connection with the process of\n dispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the courts having\n supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. Hence,\n it refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the\n seat of the arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in\n \nSection 2(1)(e)\n has to be construed keeping in view the\n provisions in \nSection 20\n which give recognition to party\n autonomy. Accepting the narrow construction as projected by\n the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render\n \nSection 20\n nugatory. In our view, the legislature has\n intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court\n which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is\n located and the courts where the arbitration takes place. This\n was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may\n provide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be\n neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courts where the\n arbitration takes place would be required to exercise\n supervisory control over the arbitral process.

The Constitution Bench accepted that the parties could\nconfer jurisdiction on an unconnected/neutral forum to\nsupervise arbitration proceedings, but did not offer\nclarifcation, whether this choice would be the exclusive or\nnon-exclusive choice.\n\n \nThis clarifcation, however, came from the Apex Court in\nthe case of \nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\n (supra)\nwherein it was clarifed that the contracting party would\nchoose an un-connected forum as a 'seat' and that would vest\nexclusive jurisdiction in the said Court to decide any dispute.\n\n23. \nIn the case of \nUnion of India Vs.

It was held that the mere\nchoice of venue could not by itself be construed as choice of the\nseat of arbitration; instead, venue could become the seat, if\nsometing else is added to it as a concomitant, though the Apex\nCourt did not deem it appropriate to identify as to what would\nbe the additional factors, which would be considered by it to\ndetermine, whether the choice of venue is to be treated as\nchoice of seat.\n\n24. After this decision, came the verdict of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of \nBrahmani River Pellets Limited\n (supra),\nwherein the arbitration clause in form of caluse 18 read thus :-\n\n \"18. Arbitration shall be under Indian Arbitration and\n Conciliation Law 1996 and the Venue of Arbitration shall be\n Bhubaneswar.\"\n\nIn paragraph 15, the Apex Court held as under :-\n\n \n\"15. As per \nSection 20\n of the Act, parties are free to agree\n on the place of arbitration. Party autonomy has to be\n construed in the context of parties choosing a court which has\n jurisdiction out of two or more competent courts having\n jurisdiction. This has been made clear in the three-Judges\n Bench decision in \nSwastik Gases (P) Ltd. v. Indian Oil Corpn.\n Ltd\n.\n\n 15.1. In the said case, respondent-Indian Oil Corporation\n Ltd. appointed M/s. Swastik Gases (P) Ltd. situated at Jaipur,\n Rajasthan as their consignment agent. The dispute arose\n between the parties as huge quantity of stock of lubricants\n could not be sold by the applicant and they could not be\n resolved amicably. In the said matter, Clause 18 of the\n agreement between the parties provided that the agreement\n shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata.\n 15.2 The appellant-Swastik invoked Clause 18 -\n arbitration clause and fled application under \nSection 11(6)\n of\n the Act before the Rajasthan High Court for appointment of\n arbitrator. The respondent contested the application made by\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 19/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n Swastik inter alia by raising the plea of lack of territorial\n jurisdiction of the Rajasthan High Court in the matter. The\n plea of Indian Oil Corporation was that the agreement has\n been made subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata and\n the Rajasthan High Court lacks the territorial jurisdiction in\n dealing with the application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act.\n 15.3 The designated Judge held that Rajasthan High\n Court did not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain the\n application under \nSection 11(6)\nof the Act and gave liberty to\n Swastik to fle the arbitration application in the Calcutta High\n Court which order came to be challenged before the Supreme\n Court.\n\n 15.4 Pointing out that the words like \"alone\", \"only\",\n \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" have not been used\n in the agreement and use of such words is not decisive and\n non-use of such words does not make any material difference\n as to the intention of the parties by having Clause 18 of the\n agreement that the courts at Kolkata shall have the\n jurisdiction, the Supreme Court held as under:-\n\n \"31. In the instant case, the appellant does not dispute that\n part of cause of action has arisen in Kolkata. What the\n appellant says is that part of cause of action has also arisen in\n Jaipur and, therefore, the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High\n Court or the designate Judge has jurisdiction to consider the\n application made by the appellant for the appointment of an\n arbitrator under \nSection 11\n. Having regard to \nSection 11(12)\n\n (b) and \nSection 2(e)\n of the 1996 Act read with \nSection 20(c)\n\n of the Code, there remains no doubt that the Chief Justice or\n the designate Judge of the Rajasthan High Court has\n jurisdiction in the matter. The question is, whether parties by\n virtue of Clause 18 of the agreement have agreed to exclude\n the jurisdiction of the courts at Jaipur or, in other words,\n whether in view of Clause 18 of the agreement, the\n jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Rajasthan High Court\n has been excluded?\n\n 32. For answer to the above question, we have to see the effect\n of the jurisdiction clause in the agreement which provides\n that the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the\n courts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for\n jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like \"alone\",\n \"only\", \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" have not been\n used but this, in our view, is not decisive and does not make\n any material difference. The intention of the parties--by\n having Clause 18 in the agreement-- is clear and\n unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 20/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone\n shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of\n jurisdiction clause, like Clause 18 in the agreement, the\n maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius comes into play\n as there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal\n maxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of\n another. By making a provision that the agreement is subject\n to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have\n impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the\n contract specifes the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular\n place and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the\n matter, we think that an inference may be drawn that parties\n intended to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not\n hit by \nSection 23\n of the Contract Act at all. Such clause is\n neither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It\n does not offend \nSection 28\n of the Contract Act in any manner.\"\n\n25. Paragraphs 18 and 19 recorded the conclusion in the\nfollowing words :-\n\n \"18. Where the contract specifes the jurisdiction of the\n court at a particular place, only such court will have the\n jurisdiction to deal with the matter and parties intended to\n exclude all other courts. In the present case, the parties have\n agreed that the \"venue\" of arbitration shall be at\n Bhubaneswar. Considering the agreement of the parties\n having Bhubaneswar as the venue of arbitration, the intention\n of the parties is to exclude all other courts. As held in Swastik,\n non-use of words like \"exclusive jurisdiction\", \"only\",\n \"exclusive\", \"alone\" is not decisive and does not make any\n material difference.\n\n 19. When the parties have agreed to have the \"venue\" of\n arbitration at Bhubaneswar, the Madras High Court erred in\n assuming the jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act.\n Since only Orissa High Court will have the jurisdiction to\n entertain the petition fled under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act, the\n impugned order is liable to be set aside.\"\n\n26. \nIn this case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court deviated from\nthe decision in \nHardy Exploration\n (supra) holding that the\nparties' choice of the \"venue of arbitration\" is really that of the\n\"seat of arbitration\", though the Apex Court did not consider it\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 21/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nnecessary to examine whether there existed any\ncircumstances, justifying designation of venue as designation\nof seat.\n\n27. Thereafter, the Apex Court was once again confronted\nwith a similar issue in BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) , wherein the\narbitration agreement specifed that, \"the arbitration\nproceedings shall be held at New Delhi/Faridabad\". \nIt is this\ndecision, in which the Apex Court declared it's earlier decision\nin \nHardy Exploration\n (supra) to be per incuriam, since it did\nnot follow the decision of the Five-Judge Bench in BALCO\n(supra), which approved the \"shashoua principle\".\n\n The Hon'ble Apex Court reiterated the \"shashoua\nprinciple\" and laid down the following tests for determining\nthe 'seat' of arbitration :-\n\n \"1. Where the arbitration clause contains a choice of a place as\n the venue of arbitration proceedings, the use of the\n expression \"arbitration proceedings\" signifes that the entire\n proceedings would be held at such place, as opposed to one or\n more hearings. In such case, the chosen venue is really the\n seat of the arbitration.\n\n 2. Where the arbitration clause contains wording such as\n \"tribunals are to meet at or have witnesses, experts or the\n parties\" where only hearings are to be conducted at such\n place, it would lead to the conclusion that, other things beings\n consistent, the chosen venue is not the seat of the arbitration.\n\n 3. Where the arbitration clause contains wording such as\n \"arbitration proceedings shall be held at\" at a particular\n venue, this would indicate that the arbitration proceedings\n are anchored at such venue and accordingly, such venue is\n the seat of the arbitration.\n\n 4. In all these cases above, there must be no other\n \"signifcant contrary indicia\" which suggest that the chosen\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 22/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n venue is merely a geographically convenient place for meeting\n and not the seat of the arbitration.\n\n 5. In the context of an international arbitration, if a\n supranational body of rules is to govern the arbitration, then\n this would be a further indication that the venue is really the\n seat of the arbitration Similarly, in the context of a domestic\n arbitration, the choice of the Act to govern arbitral\n proceedings would point towards the choice of venue being in\n reality a choice of seat.\"\n\nIn paragraph, 61, the Hon'ble Apex specifcally held that,\n \"wherever there is an express designation of a \"venue\", and\n no designation of any alternative place as the \"seat\",\n combined with a supranational body of rules governing the\n arbitration, and no other signifcant contrary indicia, the\n inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the\n juridical seat of the arbitration proceedings.\"\n\n28. In paragraph 82, it is specifcally held as under :-\n\n \"82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may\n be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place\n of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the \"venue\" of\n the arbitration proceedings, the expression \"arbitration\n proceedings would make it clear that the \"venue\" is really the\n \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression\n does not include just one or more individual or particular\n hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including\n the making of an award at that place. This language has to be\n contrasted with language such as \"tribunal are to meet or\n have witnesses, experts or the parties\" where only hearings\n are to take place in the \"venue\", which may lead to the\n conclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated\n is not the \"seat\" of arbitral proceedings,but only a convenient\n place of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral\n proceedings \"shall be held\" at a particular venue would also\n indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral\n proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that the\n place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled\n with there being no other signifcant contrary indicia that the\n stated venue is merely a \"venue\" and not the \"seat\" of the\n arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such\n a clause designates a \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings.

In a national context, this would be replaced by\n the \nArbitration Act, 1996\n as applying to the \"stated venue\",\n which then becomes the \"seat\" for the purposes of\n arbitration.\"\n\n29. Another decision of the Apex Court, which is relevant\nand which must be referred to is in the case of \nMankastu\nImpex Private Limited\n (supra), where the parties, an Indian\ncompany and a Hong Kong company had entered into a\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU), which stipulated In-\ndian law as governing law and specifed that the Court at New\nDelhi has jurisdiction for resolution of disputes by providing\nas under :-\n\n \"Arbitration administered in Hong Kong\" and \"place of\n arbitration shall be Hong Kong\".\n\nWhen the dispute arose between the parties, the Mankastu\nImpex Private Limited approached the Supreme Court for\nappointment of a sole arbitrator under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act of\n1996 and it was contended that the Courts at New Delhi shall\nhave jurisdiction and the seat of arbitration was New Delhi.\n\n \nRelying upon the decision in the case of \nHardy\nExploration\n (supra), it was argued that Hong Kong was only\nthe venue and not the seat.\n\n The respondent -Airvisual, relying upon the decision in\nthe case of BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) , contended that Hong\nKong was the seat of arbitration, on the basis that the\narbitration agreement in the MoU specifcally provided that\nthe place of arbitration was Hong Kong.\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 24/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n In the wake of the rival contentions, it was held that\nmere reference to Hong Kong as the \"place of arbitration\" did\nnot signify that the parties had chosen Hong Kong as the seat\nof arbitration. Instead, the intention of the parties have to be\ndetermined by examining the rest of the arbitration\nagreement and their conduct, as the use of the words\n\"arbitration administered in Hong Kong\" in rest of the\nagreement clearly indicated that the seat of the arbitration\nwas Hong Kong and the Hong Kong law was the procedural law\nand, hence, the Indian Courts did not have jurisdiction.\n\n30. Once again in \nPASL Wind Solutions Private Limited Vs.\nGE Power Conversion Indian Private Limited10\n, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court clarifed the position in the case of \nMankastu\nImpex\n (supra), when it drew a parallel in the agreement\nbetween the parties, which provided for \"that dispute to be\nresolved in Zurich in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation\nand Arbitration of the ICC\". It was held that seat of arbitration\nis Zurich and this conclusion was derived upon one signifcant\nfactor, being the agreement between the parties provided that\nthe dispute shall be resolved in Zurich.\n\n31. \nIn this legal scenario, when the position of law was\ncrystallised as above, the Two-Judge Bench of the Apex Court\ndelivered it's decision in the case of \nRavi Ranjan\n (supra),\nwhere it determined a similar issue, in the backdrop of the fact\nthat the Development Agreement was entered into between\n10 (2021) 7 SCC 1\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 25/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nthe parties for development of the property situated at\nMuzaffarpur in Bihar, outside the jurisdiction of Calcutta High\nCourt. The Development Agreement was also executed in\nMuzaffarpur and contained an arbitration clause, which read\nas under :-\n\n \"37.

The facts placed before the Court reveal that, the\nrespondent moved an arbitration application in Calcutta High\nCourt, seeking appointment of an Arbitrator, but it was\nwithdrawn on technical grounds. It again fled a second\narbitration petition, wherein the appellant fled an affdavit\nquestioning the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High\nCourt, by submitting that Calcutta High Court has no\nterritorial jurisdiction to entertain and determine the\napplication, as the agreement has been executed and\nregistered in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and the piece and parcel of\nland, subject matter of the agreement, was also situated in\nMuzaffarpur Municipal Corporation, outside Calcutta. It was\nalso objected on the ground that no part of cause of action has\narisen within the jurisdiction of the Court and, hence, the\nCourt in Calcutta had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain\nand determine the present application, as it is not a Court\nwithin the meaning of \nSection 2(i)(e)\n of the Act of 1996.\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 26/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nMerely because a place of sitting was Kolkata was not\ndeterminative of the jurisdiction in Calcutta High Court was\nthe submission advanced.\n\n The Calcutta High Court allowed the arbitration petition\nand appointed a sole Arbitrator. The said order was passed,\nsince the counsel for the parties did not dispute the existence\nof valid arbitration clause and agreed to appoint an Arbitrator\nto settle the disputes.\n\n It was sought to be argued that the consent was given on\nbehalf of the appellant, without any instructions.\n\n33. The question which, therefore, arose for consideration\nbefore the Hon'ble Supreme Court was, whether the Calcutta\nHigh Court had jurisdiction to appoint an Arbitrator. The\nanswer was given in the negative, in the following words :-\n\n \"20. The question in this case is, whether the Calcutta\n High Court had territorial jurisdiction to pass the impugned\n orders. The answer to the question has to be in the negative\n for the reason that the Development Agreement was\n admittedly executed and registered outside the jurisdiction of\n the High Court of Calcutta, the agreement pertains to\n development of property located in Muzzafarpur outside\n jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court.

Of course, under \nSection 11(6)\n,an application for\n appointment of an Arbitrator necessarily has to be moved in\n the High Court, irrespective of whether the High Court has the\n jurisdiction to decide a suit in respect of the subject matter of\n arbitration and irrespective of whether the High Court at all\n has original jurisdiction to entertain and decide suits. As\n such, the defnition of Court in \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the A &\n Act would not be applicable in the case of a High Court\n exercising jurisdiction under Section 11 (6) of the A & C Act\n to appoint an Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal\n\n 27. At the same time, an application under Section\n 11(6) of the A & C Act for appointment of an Arbitrator/\n Arbitral Tribunal cannot be moved in any High Court in India,\n irrespective of its territorial jurisdiction.

The parties cannot, however, by consent,\n confer jurisdiction on a Court which inherently lacked\n jurisdiction, as argued by Mr.Sinha.\n\n 48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not\n agree to refer their disputes to the jurisdiction of the Courts in\n Kolkata. It was not the intention of the parties that Kolkata\n should be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata was only intended\n to be the venue for arbitration sittings. Accordingly, the\n Respondent himself approached the District Court at\n Muzaffarpur, and not a Court in Kolkata for interim protec-\n tion under Section 9 of the A & C Act. The Respondent having\n himself invoked the jurisdiction of the of the District Court at\n Muzaffarpur, is estopped from contending that the parties\n had agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction to the Calcutta\n High Court to the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the\n parties to the agreement construed the arbitration clause to\n designate Kolkata as the seat of arbitration. We are\n constrained to hold that Calcutta High Court inherently lacks\n jurisdiction to entertain the application of the Respondent\n under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act. The High Court\n should have decided the objection raised by the Appellant, to\n the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, to entertain the\n application under Section 11(6) of A & C Act, before\n appointing an Arbitrator.\"\n\n36. Recently, in the case of \nBBR (India) Private Limited\n\n(supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the issue,\nwhether the change in place of conducting arbitration due to\nappointment of new Arbitrator will shift the jurisdictional seat\nof arbitration. In this case, the arbitration agreement did not\nstipulate either the 'seat' or 'venue' and the sole Arbitrator\ndetermined the venue of proceedings.\n\n The Hon'ble Supreme Court, relying upon BGS SGS Soma\nJV (supra), held that the reference to the venue of the\nproceedings was really a reference to the seat of the\narbitration and once the seat is fxed by the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 29/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nunder \nSection 20(2)\n, it shall remain static and fxed, whereas\nthe venue can be moved to new location, but change of venue\ndoes not change the seat of arbitration and the Court held that,\nsubsequent hearings or proceedings at a different location\nother than the place fxed by the Arbitrator as the seat of\narbitration should not be treated as a change or relocation of\njurisdictional seat.\n\n37. The seat of arbitration is a juridical concept, which refers\nto the legal home of the arbitration and it assumes great\nsignifcance, since the seat would determine the procedural\nlaw applicable to the arbitration process. The Courts of the\nseat have exclusive jurisdiction over the conduct of arbitration\nexcept in relation to certain ancillary matters like grant of\ninterim relief and enforcement of arbitral award. As a result,\nthe seat of arbitration has primary jurisdiction over the\narbitration, with all other jurisdictions becoming secondary.\nThus, the seat is considered to be centre of gravity of\narbitration and it is often described as anchor for the\narbitration.\n\n In contrast, the venue of arbitration is merely a\ngeographical location, where the parties and/or the Arbitral\nTribunal may fnd it convenient to meet or hold meetings, with\nlittle signifcance.\n\n When place of arbitration is referred to, it may either\ncover a 'seat' or a 'venue'. \nThe Act\n of 1996 do not defne the\nterms 'seat' or 'venue', but instead uses the term, 'place of\narbitration' in \nSection 20\n and this has been interpreted by the\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 30/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nHon'ble Apex Court by referring to the two distinct meaning\nbeing assigned.\n\n However, \nSection 20(1)\n, which uses the expression\n'place' in the same context, in terms of the 'seat' i.e. the 'centre\nof gravity' of an arbitration, the same expression 'place' is\nused in the different context i.e. 'venue', which is a location for\nconducting meetings, hearings and consultations, which can be\nchanged in accordance with the convenience of the Arbitrators\nor the parties. Often, it result into a confusing state of affairs,\nwhen there is a reference to 'seat of arbitration', which\nindicate a legal system, which an arbitration can call it's\n'home', indicating not a physical location, but connection with\nthe legal system of a country, which has great signifcance in\nthe context of the international arbitration because the choice\nof 'seat' can effectively determine, what is the governing law of\narbitration. It would determine, whether Part I or \nPart II of\nthe Act\n of 1996 is applicable, but within a domestic framework\nof Indian Courts, the choice of seat as 'city' has no relevance to\nthe applicable system of law, which shall be always the Indian\nlaw irrespective of which city is chosen as 'seat'.\n\n Prior to the decision in BALCO (supra), a stipulation of\n'seat' in arbitration clause was not perceived to have bearing\npurely on domestic arbitration. A jurisdiction of a Court was\ndetermined by taking recourse to \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the Act of\n1996 and the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code,\n1908. However, the Five-Judge Bench of the Apex Court in\nBALCO (supra) clearly opined that the subject matter of\narbitration cannot be confused with the subject matter of the\nseat. The former has reference and connection with the\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 31/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nprocess of dispute resolution. It was held that jurisdiction is\nvested in two courts i.e. the court having jurisdiction over the\ncause of action and the court where the arbitration takes\nplace. The Five-Judge Bench clothed the jurisdiction upon the\ncourts located at the seat of arbitration. Even in the purely\ndomestic context which in the Court's world do not otherwise\nexist, thus paving the way for the concept of 'seat' to assume\ncenter stage in domestic arbitrations, despite indication in the\nstatutory framework to the contrary. Persuaded to accept\nthat the party autonomy is supreme, the Constitution Bench\nfound it appropriate to extend it's scope in the domestic\narbitration too. This was attempted through para 96 of the\njudgment, focusing upon the concept of 'seat' in Indian\narbitration, by clearly carving out a term 'subject-matter of\narbitration', so as to identify the Court having supervisory\ncontrol over the arbitration proceedings, which was held to be\nessentially a Court of the 'seat of the arbitration' process.\n\n While emphasising on party autonomy, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court, however, conferred upon jurisdiction on two\ndifferent Courts to exercise the power under the Act i.e. the\nCourt with supervisory jurisdiction over the seat of arbitration\nand the Court in whose jurisdiction the cause of action arose.\nThe observation in the case of BALCO (supra), in para 96,\nparticularly created confusion and led to conficting decisions\nof different High Courts. \nHowever, in \nEnercon (India) Limited\n& Ors. Vs. Enercon GMBH & Anr.11\n, the Apex Court once again\nruled to the effect that once a seat of arbitration has been fxed\nin India, it would be in the nature of exclusive jurisdiction to\n\n11 (2014) 5 SCC 1\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 32/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\nexercise the supervisory powers over the arbitration process.\n\nIn \nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\n (supra) , while the\nApex Court was dealing with the issue of exclusive jurisdiction\nwith reference to the seat of arbitration, it re-examined the\nconcept of 'seat' and 'venue' and the conclusion drawn was,\nonce a seat is designated, it is akin to exclusive jurisdiction\nclause and consequently, the Courts at the 'seat' are vested\nwith the exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the powers and\nregulate arbitral proceedings to the exclusion of all other\nCourts, including the Courts, where the cause of action arose.\n\n \nThe above principle was followed in \nBrahmani River\nPellets Limited\n (supra).\n\n38. The aforesaid authoritative rulings are, therefore,\nindicative of the fact that the Apex Court deviated from the\nconcurrent jurisdiction principle highlighted in paragraph 96\nof BALCO (supra) and held that the exclusive jurisdiction is in\nthe Court of 'seat' of arbitration. It was ultimately in BGS SGS\nSoma JV (supra), a Three-Judge Bench, speaking through\nHon'ble Shri Justice Rohinton Nariman (as His Lordship was\nthen), offered some stability to the contradicting trends by\nexpressly recording a fnding that there do not exist a concept\nof concurrent jurisdiction.\n\n The Three-Judge Bench reiterated that once the parties\ndesignate the seat of arbitration, only the Courts governing the\nseat shall have exclusive jurisdiction to govern such\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 33/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\narbitration proceedings and the jurisdiction of all other Courts\nstand ousted.\n\n The aforesaid observation came in the wake of the fact of\nan arbitration clause, which stipulated that arbitration shall\nbe held in New Delhi/Faridabad and 71 sittings were held in\nDelhi and the Award was passed in Delhi, which was appealed\nin District Court, Faridabad, Haryana. In paragraphs 60 and\n61, it is held as under :-\n\n \"60. The judgments of the English courts have examined\n the concept of the \"juridical seat\" of the arbitral proceedings,\n and have laid down several important tests in order to deter-\n mine whether the \"seat\" of the arbitral proceedings has, in\n fact, been indicated in the agreement between the parties.\n The judgment of Cooke, J., in Shashoua, states :\n\n \"34. London arbitration is a well-known phenomenon which is\n often chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as\n the law of New York, governing the substantive rights of the\n parties. This is because of the legislative framework and\n supervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are\n keen to adopt. When therefore there is an express designation\n of the arbitration venue as London and no designation of any\n alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational\n body of rules governing the arbitration and no other signifcant\n contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that\n London is the juridical seat and English Law the curial law. In\n my judgment it is clear that either London has been designated\n by the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the\n arbitration, or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all\n the relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in\n accordance with the fnal fall back provision of \nSection 3\n of the\n Arbitration Act.\"\n\n 61. It will thus be seen that wherever there is an\n express designation of a \"venue\", and no designation of any\n alternative place as the \"seat\", combined with a supranational\n body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other\n signifcant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that\n the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral\n proceeding.\"\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 34/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n39. \nIn paragraph 91 of the said law report, the principle laid\ndown in \nHardy Exploration\n (supra), was not approved, as it\nwas found to be contrary to BALCO (supra) and paragraphs 98\nand 99, it was specifcally recorded as under :-\n\n \"98. However, the fact that in all the three appeals before\n us the proceedings were fnally held at New Delhi, and the\n awards were signed in New Delhi, and not at Faridabad, would\n lead to the conclusion that both parties have chosen New\n Delhi as the \"seat\" of arbitration under \nSection 20(1)\n of the\n Arbitration Act, 1996. This being the case, both parties have,\n therefore, chosen that the courts at New Delhi alone would\n have exclusive jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings.\n Therefore, the fact that a part of the cause of action may have\n arisen at Faridabad would not be relevant once the \"seat\" has\n been chosen, which would then amount to an exclusive\n jurisdiction clause so far as courts of the \"seat\" are concerned.\n\n 99. Consequently, the impugned judgment is set aside,\n and the \nSection 34\n petition is ordered to be presented in the\n courts in New Delhi, as was held by the learned Single Judge\n of the Special Commercial Court at Gurugram. The appeals\n are allowed in the aforesaid terms.\"\n\n40. In BGS SGS Soma JV (supra), once again Shashoua\nprinciple was reiterated. In no uncertain terms, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court concluded that when a clause designates a\nvenue of arbitration and declare that arbitration shall be held\nat such a place, it indicates that venue is actually the seat,\ncoupled with the fact that there are no contrary signifcant\nindicia that 'venue' is not a 'seat'. \nThe judgment of \nHardy\nExploration\n (supra), was held to be contrary to the principle\n\nlaid down in\n BALCO (supra) and, hence, \"not being good law\".\n\n \nIt was categorically held that the Three-Judge Bench in\n\nHardy Exploration\n (supra), failed to apply the Shashoua\nprinciple to the arbitration clause in question and had it been\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 35/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\napplied, in the facts of the case, the answer would have been\nthat Kuala Lumpur, which was stated to be the 'venue' of\narbitration proceedings, would be governed by a supranational\nset of rules i.e. UNCITRAL Model Law, and there being no\nother contrary indicated, Kuala Lumpur would have been the\njuridical 'seat' of arbitration.\n\n By construing that there is no contrary indication, where\nIndia was designated as 'seat' and the parties had chosen\neither New Delhi or Faridabad, as a place where the arbitration\ncould be held, considering the wordings, \"arbitration\nproceedings shall be held at New Delhi/Faridabad, India\" and,\nsince the clause did not state that it is the venue nor is the\nlanguage used \"the Tribunal may meet,\" or \"may hear\nwitnesses, experts or parties\", the use of word 'venue' is really\nthe 'seat' of the arbitral proceedings and, hence, New Delhi/\nFaridabad, India was designated as seat of arbitration under\n\nSection 20(1)\n of the Act of 1996 and, hence, it was held that\nthe Courts at New Delhi alone, would have exclusive\njurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings.\n\n41. \nIn \nMankastu Impex Private Limited\n (supra), the Three-\nJudge Bench relied upon the principle \nlaid down in\n BALCO\n(supra) and focused upon the exclusive jurisdiction clause, the\nmoment 'seat' is determined in arbitration proceedings.\nConstruing a clause in the MoU stipulating that the MoU is\ngoverned by the law of India and the Courts at New Delhi shall\nhave jurisdiction, it was held that the the words did not mean\nto take away or dilute the intention of the parties in clause\n\nM.M.Salgaonkar\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 21/03/2023 ::: Downloaded on - 22/03/2023 15:12:50 :::\n\n 36/42 CARAP-82-22 J.odt\n\n17.2, where it was agreed that the arbitration shall be\nadministered in Hong Kong, since the words in clause 17.1 did\nnot suggest that the seat of arbitration is in New Delhi.
