FACTS :\n\n2.1. The appellant is a Co-operative Housing Society\nregistered under the\nGujarat Co-operative Societies Act,\nand the respondent is a Partnership Firm. As per the\nplaint, the respondent is in the business of buying and\nselling of land and development.\n\n2.2. The respondent had filed Special Civil Suit No.272 of\n2013 before the learned Principal Senior Civil Judge,\nMirzapur, Ahmedabad, against the present appellant inter\nalia seeking specific performance of an Agreement-to-sell\n(\"ATS\" for short) dated 22/12/2006 and an undated\nMemorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\" for short) allegedly\nexecuted between the parties. Along with the suit, the\nrespondent had also filed an application for interim\ninjunction. Thereafter, the suit was transferred to the\nlearned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Sanand and\nrenumbered as Special Civil Suit No.407 of 2017.\n\n2.3. On 11/06/2013, the learned Principal Senior Civil\nJudge, Mirzapur issued summons to the appellant and\nimmediately on receipt of the summons, within 30 days, on\n29/6/2013 the appellant preferred an application under\n\nPage 2 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\ninter-alia on the ground that\nnotice under\nsection 167\nof the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act was not issued by the respondent to the\nregistrar.

During the pendency of the suit, as there was\npossibility of settlement, on 16/7/2018, the appellant filed\na purshis before the learned trial court indicating its\nwillingness to settle the entire dispute.\n\n2.5.

On 08/08/2022, the\n\nPage 3 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nco-ordinate Bench of this Court passed the following order:\n\n\"2. Learned advocate Mr. D.C. Dave assisted by\nlearned advocate Mr. Saurabh Amin insisted\nfor interim relief. According to learned Counsel\nmany parcels of the land have already been\npurchased in the interregnum and, therefore,\nthere shall be need for some protective order.\n\n3. Mr. Pandya, since has filed his appearance\ntoday he requires time of nearly two weeks to\ntake instructions and file his affidavit-in-reply.\nHowever, in the meantime, he has on\ninstructions stated that no change will be\neffected presently whatever is the status shall\ncontinue.

On the next date of\nhearing, concerned authorized person shall be\npresent and apprise this Court about the\npresent status of the property in question.\"\n\n2.8. This interim arrangement made on the appellant's\nstatement above came to be extended from time to time\nuntil the disposal of the First Appeal.\n\n2.9. On 06/10/2022, co-ordinate Bench of this Court\nallowed the First Appeal. However, insofar as the interim\narrangement was concerned, this Court observed as follows\nbased on the appellant's statement: -\n\n\"17. So far as Annexure-B (from page 134 to\n\n141) is concerned, those are the original\nallottees. Any transfer in the interregnum to\n\nPage 4 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthem shall be accounted separately.\n\nConsidering the fact that there is a serious\ndispute in relation to the list from page 142\nto 145 it is volunteered by the learned\nadvocate, Mr.Bhadrish Raju on getting\ninstructions that the respondent shall not be\ndealing with the said list for a fortnight for\nthe purpose of transfer or otherwise in any\nmode or manner.\n\n18. Both the parties to co-operate with the\ntrial Court which shall initiate the hearing\nof Exh.5 within a period of two weeks from\nthe date of receipt of a copy of this order and\nshall decide the same within a period of four\nweeks thereafter\n\n19. Without prejudice to the rights and\ncontentions as may be raised by the parties\nthat this arrangement has been made which\nshall be also subject to the order that would\nbe passed by the trial Court concerned after\nhearing both the sides on merits of\ninjunction application. None of the\nobservations made by this Court in this\norder, while considering the matter on merit,\nshall in any manner prejudice the rights of\neither side.\"\n\n2.10. On 18/10/2022, the respondent moved a speaking to\nminutes application, inter alia, on the following ground: -\n\n\"At the time of pronouncement of judgment,\nthe Hon'ble Court had been pleased to frame\na time schedule for deciding injunction\napplication below Exh 5 application (4 weeks\nfrom the commencement of hearing). Your\nlordship bad been further pleased to extend\nthe interim arrangement (recorded in Para-\n\nPage 5 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n17) to operate till the Ld. Trial Court decides\nthe Ex. 5 application. It appears that\ninadvertently, the said aspect is not reflected\nin the final order dated 06.10.2022 and\nhence this note.\"\n\n2.11. On 19/10/2022, the appellant made a statement\nbefore this Hon'ble Court that the interim arrangement\nconcerning the list from page number 142-145 of the\nappellant's affidavit dated 01/09/2022 filed in the First\nAppeal may continue until four weeks from the date of the\ninitiation of the hearing of the interim injunction application\nEx.5 by the learned trial court or until an order on merits is\npassed, whichever is earlier. This Court passed an order\nrecording the appellant's above statement on 19/10/2022\nand modified the order dated 06/10/2022 accordingly.\n\n2.12. Thereafter, on 20/10/2022, the Suit was restored.\nThe learned trial court thereafter passed an order on\n20/10/2022 laying out a time schedule to complete hearing\nthe of the application Exh.5. On 01/11/2022, the appellant\nmoved an application to re-open its right to file a written\nstatement and reply to the interim injunction application\nalong with the written statement and reply to the interim\ninjunction application, production application, and\nsupporting documents requesting that its right to file a\nwritten statement and reply to the interim injunction\napplication be re-opened in light of the direction by this\n\nPage 6 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nCourt to decide the interim injunction application within a\nspan of 4 weeks and also in the interest of justice to ensure\nthat all the appellant's defenses are bought on record. On\nthe very day, the respondent filed its written objections to\nthe appellant's application.\n\n2.13. The learned trial court rejected the appellant's\napplication to re-open its right to file a written statement\nand reply to the application Exh.5 on 01/11/2022 against\nwhich the appellant preferred Special Civil Application\nNo.22297 of 2022 and this Court was pleased to allow the\nSpecial Civil Application and re-open the appellant's right to\nfile a written statement and reply to the Application Exh.5\nvide order dated 09/11/2022. That inadvertently in para\n27(E) of the order dated 09/11/2022 in Special Civil\nApplication No. 22297 of 2022, passed by this Court, it has\nbeen mentioned that \"Interim arrangement as noted by the\nDivision Bench of this Court vide order dated 19/10/2022\nshall continue for a period of three weeks from the date this\norder is submitted to the learned Civil Judge concerned.\".\n\n2.14. On 12/11/2022, the appellant challenged the\norder dated 06/10/2022 (as modified by the order dated\n19/10/2022) passed by this Court in First Appeal No. 2320\nof 2022 before the Hon'ble Apex Court vide SLP(C) No.\n20976 of 2022.\n\nPage 7 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n2.15. Thereafter, as the appellant's request to file an\nadditional written statement was allowed by this Court in\nSpecial Civil Application No. 22297/2022, on 17/11/2022,\nan additional written statement was filed before the learned\ntrial court and even the order dated 09/11/2022 was served\non the learned trial court. The respondent thereafter filed its\nreply to the written statement and additional written\nstatement along with documents to be relied upon on.\n\n2.16. On 25.11.2022, the Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased\nto issue notice in SLP(C) No. 20976 of 2022 and also\nobserved that no final judgment may be passed in the Suit.\nThe Hon'ble Apex Court also recorded in its order that \"...\nTill the disposal of the said interim injunction, status quo\nwith respect to the property in dispute shall be maintained\nby the parties. However, the appellant submits that it has\nbeen inadvertently recorded by the Hon'ble Apex Court that\nstatus quo has to be maintained by the parties till disposal\nof the interim injunction, because on 25/11/2022, the\nHon'ble Apex Court had only directed that the interim\narrangement between the parties shall continue till disposal\nof the Exh.5 application and also because there was no\norder of status quo existing qua the Suit lands. The\nappellant submits that the appellant has filed IA No.\n193876 of 2022 to modify the above order.\n\n2.17. That on 29/11/2022, the appellant and respondent\n\nPage 8 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ncompleted their oral arguments with respect to the\napplication Exh.5 and the appellant even submitted its\nwritten submissions. The learned trial court allowed the\napplication Exh.5 vide order dated 30/11/2022. That after\npronouncement of the Impugned Order, the appellant\nmoved an application before the learned trial court praying\nthat the Impugned Order may be stayed to exercise its\nstatutory remedy of challenging the Impugned Order. The\nrespondent filed its objections to the above application.\nThereafter, the application for stay came to be rejected by\nthe learned trial court vide order order dated 30/11/2022.\n\n2.18. The appellant, being aggrieved and dissatisfied by\nthe aforesaid Impugned Order dated 30/11/2022 passed\nbelow application Ex.5 in Special Civil Suit No.407 of 2017,\nhas preferred the present Appeal From Order.\n\n3. SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT :\n\n3.1. Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas mainly based his arguments on the points of [1]\nlimitation [2] novation [iii] non-joinder of parties [iv]\nunamended\nsections 13\n,\nand\n16(1)(c)\nof the Specific\nRelief Act [v] bar of\nsection 167\nof the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act and [vi]\nSection 10\nof the Specific Relief Act.\n\nBased upon those points, Mr.Soparkar, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant has argued on the principle of\ninjunction and argued on the finding of the learned trial\n\nPage 9 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ncourt.\n\nWhereas, on the other-hand, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned\nsenior advocate for the respondent has based his\ncontentions and arguments in reply to all the contentions\nraised by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant.\n\n4. LIMITATION :-\n\n4.1. Submission of appellant on limitation:\n\nOn the point of Limitation, Mr.Soparkar, learned\nsenior advocate for the appellant has contended that the\nappellant is a registered co-operative housing society and\nas per the ATS, the appellant was required to execute sale\ndeed for the suit land in favour of the respondent upon\npayment of 50% of the total consideration and as according\nto the ledger amount submitted by the respondent, they\nhave paid 50% of the amount of total consideration of\nRs.15,80,08,800/- on 28/8/2007. Since the 50% of the\namount has been paid on 28/8/2007, and the suit is filed\nin 2013, as per Part 1 of\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act\n, the\nsuit is beyond 3 years.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas submitted that as per the rejoinder filed by the\nrespondent, it is the case of the respondent that execution\nof the sale deed were refused after the payment of 50% of\nconsideration, which has taken place in the year 2007 and\n\nPage 10 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ntherefore, the trial court has erred in not believing the issue\nof limitation.\n\n4.2. Submission of the respondent on Limitation:\n\nPer contra, on the point of Limitation, it has been\ncontended by Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for\nthe respondent that ATS does not provide for any calendar\ndate for executing sale deed and when there is no specific\ndate mentioned, Part 1 of\nArticle 54\nof the\nLimitation Act\n\ndoes not apply. It is contended that ATS fixes time for\npayment only and even that is not essence of the contract.\nATS clause 3 provides for fulfillment of reciprocal\nobligations by the defendant society, namely (i) obtaining\nclear title (ii) giving possession of land. Clause 4 and 5\nfurther provide that seller shall obtain Income Tax clearance\ncertificates by 15.01.2007 and shall obtain all necessary\npermissions for sale. It is further contended that the society\nwas not in a position to perform its part of obligation. As\nsuch, till 2013, only two survey numbers were owned by the\nappellant society and in May, 2013, though the society\ncleared title of survey Nos.227 and 228, the society refused\nto perform according to the terms of the ATS and the suit\nwas immediately filed and the suit does no barred by law of\nlimitation.\n\n4.3. Finding of the Court on Limitation:-\n\nHaving heard the learned advocates for the respective\n\nPage 11 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nparties, the issue which is in dispute between the parties is\nas to, from which date the period of limitation starts for\nfiling of the suit. Admittedly, ATS and MOU are the main\ndocuments relied upon by both the parties and there is no\ndispute regarding the date of MOU. There is dispute with\nrespect to the date of MOU. Here in this case, the\nrespondent - plaintiff filed the suit for specific performance\nof the ATS which is executed in the year 2006 and also\nMOU which according to the case fo the appellant is\nexecuted in the year 2007 and as per the case of the\nrespondent, it is executed in the year 2011. No doubt, the\nlearned trial court in the finding regarding limitation has\ngiven finding that the execution of MOU is in the year 2011\nand it has been considered to be the extension of time for\nthe purpose of ATS and the payment of Rs.11,49,60,600/-\nhas been given on 25/5/2011 as per the ledger which is\nproduced in the trial court's record vide Ex.3/22.\n\nAs such, the contention of both the parties on the\npoint of limitation depends upon the appreciation of the\ndate of MOU. There is no dispute regarding the date of ATS,\nwhich is in the year 2006 but the MOU which is placed on\nrecord is without date and as per the respondent, it is of\n2011. It depends upon the books of accounts - ledger which\nis produced through which contention regarding payment as\nto upto which date the payment has been made can be\ndecided. Under the circumstances, this Court is of the\nopinion that as the issue of limitation is of a nature\n\nPage 12 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwherein there is disputes regarding dates and payments\nand hence the issue of limitation can be decided by the trial\ncourt as a preliminary issue taking upon preliminary\nevidence regarding execution of the MOU and the payment\nmentioned.\n\n5. BAR OF SECTION 167 :\n\n5.1. Submission of appellant on bar of section 167:\n\nSo far as contention regarding question of bar under\nsection\nof the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act is concerned,\nit is submitted by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for\nthe appellant that the suit is not maintainable for non-\n\ncompliance of\nsection 167\nof the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act. As the suit touches the business of the\nsociety, notice is required under\nsection 167\nof the Gujarat\nCo-operative Societies Act and notice was required to be\nserved at the registered address and admittedly the\nrespondent failed to serve such notice.\n\n5.2. Submission of respondent on bar of\nsection 167\n:\n\nPer contra, it is vehemently opposed by Mr.Minir Joshi,\nlearned senior advocate for the respondent that the order by\nwhich the trial court has rejected the plaint in exercise of\nOrder 7 Rule 11 on the point of non-compliance of issuance\nof notice under\nsection 167\nof the Gujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act, in the said order, the learned trial court has\ndealt with the judgement of the Division Bench of this Court\n\nPage 13 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrendered in First Appeal No.2320 of 2022 and considering\nthe dispute between the parties, in para 15.6 it has been\nheld as under :-\n\n\"15.6. Thus, considering the complexity of\nthe transactions involved the Court notices\nthat though the focal point of dispute\nrevolves around the suit lands of which the\nCooperative Housing society claims to have\nright, based on which agreement to sell and\nMOU have been executed in favour of plaintiff\nfirm, however, at this stage of order 7 rule\n11, where one is required to look into the\npleadings only, it would be unjust to go to\nhold as \"touching the business of the\nsociety\"....,\n\nIt has been observed in para 15.6 of the order of the\nDivision Bench in First Appeal No.2320 of 2012 that, this is\nnot a matter which can be permitted to be dismissed on the\npoint of\nsection 167\nof the Act. Thereafter the Division\nBench considered the issue of maintainability of the suit.\nHowever, the said order passed by the Division Bench in\nFirst Appeal No.2320 of 2022 has been challenged before\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court and the SLP is pending. However, at\npresent, as per the order of the Division Bench in First\nAppeal No.2320 of 2012, the bar of\nsection 167\n, as it has\nbeen directed to be decided as preliminary issue by the trial\ncourt in accordance with law at the time of hearing.\n\n6. NOVATION :\n\n6.1. Submission of appellant on novation:\n\nPage 14 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant has\ncontended that the respondent - plaintiff in the suit has\nprayed for specific performance of the ATS and MOU. It is\nvehemently submitted that in the rejoinder filed by the\nrespondent - plaintiff in para 5, condition Nos.B and C of\nATS were reproduced and it was specifically stated that as\nper the new conditions laid down in the MOU, there was a\nnovation in the agreement. It is further submitted that as\nper\nsection 62\nof the Indian Contract Act, the original ATS\nin this case, does not need to be performed and it is the\ncase of the respondent. It is further submitted that in the\nMOU, clause Nos.7C and 7D came to be inserted, which\nhas changed the nature of the agreement. Clause 7C\nindicates new party Mr.Ashish Patel holds 25% in the suit\nland and clause 7D states that the appellant and\nrespondent will jointly sell, mortgage and deal with the suit\nland. As such, the agreement for sale has been converted\ninto a joint-selling agreement/joint development agreement\nand hence, the suit for specific performance is not\nmaintainable. It is also contended that specific\nperformance of the MOU also prayed for and the\nrespondent has also prayed in the plaint that sale deeds in\nthe suit lands may be executed in favour of anyone\nproposed by the respondent which indicates that the\nnature of the agreement between the parties has ceased to\nbe an agreement for sale to that of an understanding of\ndevelopment of the land, as it novated the original ATS.\n\nPage 15 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nIn support of above submission, Mr.Soparkar, learned\nsenior advocate for the appellant has placed reliance on the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the of\nManoj Kumar\nAgrawal v. Dulari Bai\n2006 SCC OnLine Chapter 15 para\n5, wherein the Hon'ble Court has held and observed as\nfollows:\n\n\"....It indicates that on the wishes or choice\nof appellant the sale deed is to be executed\neven in the name of third person whether\nsuch an agreement can be treated as\nagreement to sale is a question debatable.\"\n\n6.2. Submission of respondent on novation :\n\nPer contra regarding contention of the appellant on novation\nis concerned, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for\nthe respondent has submitted that the contention of\nnovation is not raised in the in Written Statement and said\ncontention of novation was never raised before the learned\ntrial court. However, the plaintiff has prayed for specific\nperformance of the ATS as well as MOU on the issue of\nnovation being academic and suit will not fail on the ground\nthat ATS did not survive. It is further contended that even\notherwise, the MOU has to be read as a whole. In the MOU\nall the terms of the ATS are reproduced in paragraph Nos. 1\nto 6 and in 7(a) to 7(f) conditions are laid down regarding\nIncome Tax clearance. It is contended that all essential\nconditions of ATS remained the same in MOU and in law\n\nPage 16 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthere is no novation and the parties never understood it to\nbe so. It is submitted that all the obligation of the society to\nsell the lands to the respondent - plaintiff remain the same\nand therefore the arrangement between respondent -\nplaintiff and Mr.Ashish Patel, which was contained in 7(c)\nand 7(d), which becomes effective, after the land is sold by\nsociety, and so it does not amount to a new agreement with\nthe society and it is to be interpreted accordingly. It is also\nsubmitted that the phrase \"banne-taraf-wala\" used in\nclause 7(d) of the MOU is to be read with clause 7(c) of the\nMOU which meant the plaintiff and Mr.Ashish Patel and\nnot the plaintiff and the society and as per the MOU,\nobligation of the society is to convey the agreed land to the\nrespondent - plaintiff for agreed consideration and\nthereafter the respondent plaintiff can deal with the land\nwith Mr.Ashish Patel or anyone else.\n\n6.3. Finding on Novation :\n\nSo far as the contentions of the parties with regard to the\nissue of novation is concerned,\nsection 62\nof the Indian\nContract Act is required to be considered, which reads thus:\n\n\"62. Effect of novation, rescission, and\nalteration of contract.--\n\nIf the parties to a contract agree to\nsubstitute a new contract for it, or to\nrescind or alter it, the original contract,\nneed not to be performed.\n\nPage 17 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nHere in this case, it appears that the respondent -\nplaintiff has argued in a contradictory manner regarding\nsubmission of novation, it has been submitted that all the\nconditions of ATS remain the same in the MOU and MOU is\nnever considered to be novation and clause 7(c) and 7(d)\nclearly which meant the respondent - plaintiff and\nMr.Ashish Patel and not the plaintiff and the society and\nhence it is not a new agreement with the society. However,\nin the opinion of this Court, the respondent cannot contend\nboth the contentions. If the respondent seeks specific\nperformance of the ATS as well as MOU, it is evident that\nthere is change in the ATS and which can be termed to be\nnovation of the ATS by insertion of clause 7(c) and 7(d). If it\nis believed that the clause 7(c) and 7(d) were between the\nrespondent plaintiff and Mr.Ashish Patel, then the\ninterpretation of phrase \"banne taraf wala\" alleviates\nMr.Ashish Patel to the signatory of the MOU on behalf of\nthe Chairman of the society as well as in his individual\ncapacity, as he has been given 25% in the land and if that\nis the case, right of Mr.Ashish Patel are also to be decided\nwhile granting performance of the MOU and there is no\nreason for not impleading Mr.Ashish Patel as a party to the\nsuit. The respondent plaintiff is seeking 100% performance\nof the MOU and rights of Mr.Ashish Patel are going to be\naffected and hence the respondent cannot take\ncontradictory stand especially considering the fact that\nthere is no other development agreement between the\n\nPage 18 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrespondent and Mr.Ashish Patel.\n\nEven if it is considered that clause 7(d) is not between\nMr.Ashish Patel and the respondent - plaintiff, then it has\nto be appellant society and the respondent. Hence, it can be\nconsidered that Mr.Ashish Patel has right without he being\na party or clause 7(c) and 7(d) is between the appellant and\nthe respondent. Hence, making the MOU is a novation\nversion of ATS in the form of joint development agreement,\nwhich cannot be termed to be specific agreement to sell. It is\nnot specific agreement to sell, however, if it is proved by\nleading cogent and convincing evidence that the insertion of\nclause 7(c) is a novation on the basis of evidence, the\noriginal ATS, which is to be enforced, will go away and\nhence in the light of the observations made in the case of\n\nManoj Kumar Agrawal\n(supra) as such an agreement can\nbe treated as agreement to sell in is a question which is\ndebatable, this issue of novation is left open to be decided\nby the learned trial court but at the same time as observed,\nnew insertion of clause 7(c) and 7(d), right of Mr.Ashish\nPatel is also to be affected if on the point of novation is to be\ndecided by the trial court, eitherway.\n\n7. NON-JOINDER OF PARTIES:\n\n7.1. Submission of appellant on non-joinder of parties:\n\nIt is vehemently submitted by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant that the suit is bad for non-\njoinder of necessary parties. It is admitted position that the\n\nPage 19 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nappellant has filed the litigation against the original owners\nof the suit, additionally, clause 5 of the ATS specifically\nrecords that earlier allotment made to the allottees /\nmembers of the society have to be cancelled. In such\ncircumstances, it is submitted that without adding either\nthe original owners of the suit land or the allottees /\nmembers, as party to the suit, the suit is not maintainable,\nas it is apparent on record that the rights of third parties\nwill be adversely affected, in case they are not heard. As\nstated above, the MOU also reveals that 75% of the land\nbelongs to the respondent - plaintiff and 25% of the land\nbelongs to Mr.Ashish Patel. It is also submitted that in the\nrejoinder before the learned trial court, the respondent -\nplaintiff has admitted that they will be joining necessary\nparty to the suit. However, the respondent - plaintiff has\ncontended that the original owners, allottees / members or\nMr.Ashish Patel need not to be included as party to the\nsuit., whereas the respondent himself has admitted that\nthey are going to add necessary parties to the suit, this is\nnot the case where the principles of Dominus Litus will\napply.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned advocate for the appellant has\nplaced reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nthe case of Mashkoor Hasan Khan vs. Zila Parishad, 1977\nSCC OnLine All 185, paragraph Nos. 2 & 3 of which read\nas follow:\n\nPage 20 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n\"2. lt may be noted that the actual bidders\nor the persons in whose favour the rights\nhave now been granted by the Zila Parishad\nwere not implemented as parties to the suit\nnor in Parishad wean interim injunction\nmade in the suit. They are not implemented\nin this appeal either. In the counter\naffidavit filed on behalf of the Zila Parishad\nit has been stated that written contracts\nhad already been entered into by the Zila\nParishad for collection of carcass, bones\nand hides etc. with third parties who are\nnot parties to the suit or to this appeal.\n\n3. It is thus obvious that in case any\ninjunction is granted it will adversely affect\nthe interest of third parties who are not\npresent before this Court. In these\ncircumstances the interim injunction was\nnot in fact maintainable and it was not\nnecessary for the court below to go into the\nmerits of the application.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant, has also placed reliance on the decision of the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nMumbai International\nAirport Private Limited Vs. Regency Convention Centre\nand Hotels Private Limited and others\n, reported in\n(2010) 7 SCC 417 on the aspect of proper and necessary\nparty. Para 15 of\nthe said decision\nreads as follow :\n\n\"A `necessary party' is a person who ought to\nhave been joined as a party and in whose\n\nPage 21 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nabsence no effective decree could be passed\nat all by the Court. If a `necessary party' is\nnot impleaded, the suit itself is liable to be\ndismissed. A `proper party' is a party who,\nthough not a necessary party, is a person\nwhose presence would enable the court to\ncompletely, effectively and adequately\nadjudicate upon all matters in disputes in\nthe suit, though he need not be a person in\nfavour of or against whom the decree is to be\nmade. If a person is not found to be a proper\nor necessary party, the court has no\njurisdiction to implead him, against the\nwishes of the plaintiff. The fact that a\nperson is likely to secure a right/interest in\na suit property, after the suit is decided\nagainst the plaintiff, will not make such\nperson a necessary party or a proper party\nto the suit for specific performance.\"\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant, has also placed reliance on the decision in the\ncase of\nSajli Kishku vs. Talamoyee Kishku and Ors.\n\nreported in MANU/WB/2023/2019.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas further submitted that Mr.Ashish Patel admittedly being\n25% of the co-owner of the suit land, would even otherwise\nis a necessary party to the suit and the relief are clearly\nevidently against him. It is the case of the respondent that\nthe phrase \"banne tarafwala\" used in clause 7(d) would\ninclude only Mr.Ashish Patel and the respondent, meaning\nthereby condition to sell the land would be limited to them\n\nPage 22 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nonly, as such, Mr.Ashish Patel becomes a party to the MOU,\neven otherwise, Mr.Ashish Patel cannot be termed as\n\"banne tarafwala\". It is also submitted by Mr.Soparkar,\nlearned senior advocate for the appellant that specific\nperformance of the contract cannot be sought without\nimpleading all the parties to the contract and since the\nrespondent has sought specific performance of the MOU in\nwhich Mr.Ashish Patel is having right to the extent of 25%\nof land, as per becomes bad for non-joinder of parties and\nthe phrase \"banne tarafwala\" clearly shows admission that\nMr.Ashish Patel is a party to the MOU.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\non the point of non-joinder of parties has submitted that\nthere are allottees in the suit land who have been allotted\nplots in the land after the society came into existence and\nthey are having Allotment Letters to that effect and\nadmittedly the plaintiff was knowing this aspect, as it is\nmentioned in the ATS regarding removal of the allottees\nfrom the suit land. It is also submitted that some of the\nallottees have filed application for leave to appeal being\nMisc. Civil Application No.34 of 2023, which states that the\nallottees are the owners of the land allotted to them and the\nundivided share of the common amenities and services as\nmembers of the societies. The allotment Dastavej, which is\nproduced, pertains to plot No.15 of the appellant society in\nthe leave to appeal specifically states that apart from the\n\nPage 23 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nplot, the members have undivided rights in the common\nroads and common amenities of the appellant society, which\nhas spread across the entire appellant society including the\nsuit land against which valuable consideration has been\npaid by the allottees / members. Therefore, even the\nallottees / members are the necessary parties to the suit as\nthey have interest in the suit land.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nthe case of Shivali (Vejalpur) Co-Op.Hosg.\nSociety Ltd. v.\nState of Gujarat\n, reported in 2009 SCC OnLine Guj\n11322.\n\n7.2. Submission of the respondent on non-joinder of\nparties:\n\nPer contra, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate\nfor the respondent on the point of non-joinder of parties has\ncontended that the parties to the agreement to sell are\nnecessary parties, only parties to the contract can be joined,\nno party claiming individual right can be joined as it would\nchange the nature of the suit.\nIn support of his submission,\nMr.Mihir Joshi has relied on the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of\nGurmit Singh Bhatia v. Kiran\nKant Robinson\n, reported in (2020) 13 SCC 773]. Para 5 of\nthe said judgement reads thus:\n\nPage 24 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n\"5. We have heard the learned counsel for the\nrespective parties at length.\n\n5.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that the\noriginal plaintiffs filed the suit against the original\nowner - vendor - original defendant no.1 for specific\nperformance of the agreement to sell with respect to\nsuit property dated 3.5.2005. It is an admitted position\nthat so far as agreement to sell dated 3.5.2005 of\nwhich the specific performance is sought, the appellant\nis not a party to the said agreement to sell. It appears\nthat during the pendency of the aforesaid suit and\nthough there was an injunction against the original\nowner - vendor restraining him from transferring and\nalienating the suit property, the vendor executed the\nsale deed in favour of the appellant by sale deed dated\n10.07.2008. After a period of approximately four years,\nthe appellant filed an application before the learned\ntrial Court under\nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\nfor his\nimpleadment as a defendant. The appellant claimed\nthe right on the basis of the said sale deed as well as\nthe agreement to sell dated 31.3.2003 alleged to have\nbeen executed by the original vendor. The said\napplication was opposed by the original plaintiffs. The\nlearned trial Court despite the opposition by the\noriginal plaintiffs allowed the said application which\nhas been set aside by the High Court by the impugned\njudgment and order. Thus, it was an application under\n\nOrder 1 Rule 10 of the CPC\nby a third party to the\nagreement to sell between the original plaintiffs and\noriginal defendant no.1 (vendor) and the said\napplication for impleadment is/was opposed by the\noriginal plaintiffs. Therefore, the short question which\nis posed for consideration before this Court is, whether\nthe plaintiffs can be compelled to implead a person in\nthe suit for specific performance, against his wish and\nmore particularly with respect to a person against\nwhom no relief has been claimed by him?\n\n5.2 An identical question came to be considered before\nthis Court in the case of Kasturi vs. Iyyamperumal,\nreported in (2005) 6 SCC 733 and applying the\nprinciple that the plaintiff is the dominus litis, in the\nsimilar facts and circumstances of the case, this Court\nobserved and held that the question of jurisdiction of\n\nPage 25 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthe court to invoke\nOrder 1 Rule 10 CPC\nto add a party\nwho is not made a party in the suit by the plaintiff\nshall not arise unless a party proposed to be added has\ndirect and legal interest in the controversy involved in\nthe suit. It is further observed and held by this Court\nthat two tests are to be satisfied for determining the\nquestion who is a necessary party. The tests are - (1)\nthere must be a right to some relief against such party\nin respect of the controversies involved in the\nproceedings; (2) no effective decree can be passed in the\nabsence of such party. It is further observed and held\nthat in a suit for specific performance the first test can\nbe formulated is, to determine whether a party is a\nnecessary party there must be a right to the same relief\nagainst the party claiming to be a necessary party,\nrelating to the same subject matter involved in the\nproceedings for specific performance of contract to sell.\n\nIt is further observed and held by this Court that in a\nsuit for specific performance of the contract, a proper\nparty is a party whose presence is necessary to\nadjudicate the controversy involved in the suit. It is\nfurther observed and held that the parties claiming an\nindependent title and possession adverse to the title of\nthe vendor and not on the basis of the contract, are not\nproper parties and if such party is impleaded in the\nsuit, the scope of the suit for specific performance shall\nbe enlarged to a suit for title and possession, which is\nimpermissible. It is further observed and held that a\nthird party or a stranger cannot be added in a suit for\nspecific performance, merely in order to find out who is\nin possession of the contracted property or to avoid\nmultiplicity of the suits. It is further observed and held\nby this Court that a third party or a stranger to a\ncontract cannot be added so as to convert a suit of one\ncharacter into a suit of different character.\n\n5.3. In the case of Kasturi (supra) in paragraphs 15\nand 16, this Court observed and held as under:\n\n\"15. As discussed hereinearlier, whether Respondents 1\nand 4 to 11 were proper parties or not, the governing\nprinciple for deciding the question would be that the\npresence of Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 before the court\nwould be necessary to enable it effectually and\ncompletely to adjudicate upon and settle all the\n\nPage 26 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nquestions involved in the suit. As noted hereinearlier,\nin a suit for specific performance of a contract for sale,\nthe issue to be decided is the enforceability of the\ncontract entered into between the appellant and\nRespondents 2 and 3 and whether contract was\nexecuted by the appellant and Respondents 2 and 3 for\nsale of the contracted property, whether the plaintiffs\nwere ready and willing to perform their part of the\ncontract and whether the appellant is entitled to a\ndecree for specific performance of a contract for sale\nagainst Respondents 2 and 3. It is an admitted position\nthat Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 did not seek their\naddition in the suit on the strength of the contract in\nrespect of which the suit for specific performance of\nthe contract for sale has been filed.\n\nAdmittedly, they based their claim on independent title\nand possession of the contracted property. It is,\ntherefore, obvious as noted hereinearlier that in the\nevent, Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 are added or\nimpleaded in the suit, the scope of the suit for specific\nperformance of the contract for sale shall be enlarged\nfrom the suit for specific performance to a suit for title\nand possession which is not permissible in law.\nIn the\ncase of\nVijay Pratap v. Sambhu Saran Sinha\n[(1996) 10\nSCC 53] this Court had taken the same view which is\nbeing taken by us in this judgment as discussed above.\nThis Court in that decision clearly held that to decide\nthe right, title and interest in the suit property of the\nstranger to the contract is beyond the scope of the suit\nfor specific performance of the contract and the same\ncannot be turned into a regular title suit. Therefore, in\nour view, a third party or a stranger to the contract\ncannot be added so as to convert a suit of one\ncharacter into a suit of different character. As\ndiscussed above, in the event any decree is passed\nagainst Respondents 2 and 3 and in favour of the\nappellant for specific performance of the contract for\nsale in respect of the contracted property, the decree\nthat would be passed in the said suit, obviously, cannot\nbind Respondents 1 and 4 to 11. It may also be\nobserved that in the event, the appellant obtains a\ndecree for specific performance of the contracted\nproperty against Respondents 2 and 3, then, the Court\nshall direct execution of deed of sale in favour of the\nappellant in the event Respondents 2 and 3 refusing to\n\nPage 27 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nexecute the deed of sale and to obtain possession of the\ncontracted property he has to put the decree in\nexecution. As noted hereinearlier, since Respondents 1\nand 4 to 11 were not parties in the suit for specific\nperformance of a contract for sale of the contracted\nproperty, a decree passed in such a suit shall not bind\nthem and\nin that case\n, Respondents 1 and 4 to 11\nwould be at liberty either to obstruct execution in\norder to protect their possession by taking recourse to\nthe relevant provisions\nof CPC\n, if they are available to\nthem, or to file an independent suit for declaration of\ntitle and possession against the appellant or\nRespondent 3. On the other hand, if the decree is\npassed in favour of the appellant and sale deed is\nexecuted, the stranger to the contract being\nRespondents 1 and 4 to 11 have to be sued for taking\npossession if they are in possession of the decretal\nproperty.\n\n16. That apart, from a plain reading of the expression\nused in sub-rule (2)\nOrder 1 Rule 10 CPC\n\"all the\nquestions involved in the suit\" it is abundantly clear\nthat the legislature clearly meant that the\ncontroversies raised as between the parties to the\nlitigation must be gone into only, that is to say,\ncontroversies with regard to the right which is set up\nand the relief claimed on one side and denied on the\nother and not the controversies which may arise\nbetween the plaintiff-appellant and the defendants\ninter se or questions between the parties to the suit and\na third party. In our view, therefore, the court cannot\nallow adjudication of collateral matters so as to\nconvert a suit for specific performance of contract for\nsale into a complicated suit for title between the\nplaintiff-appellant on one hand and Respondents 2 and\n3 and Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 on the other. This\naddition, if allowed, would lead to a complicated\nlitigation by which the trial and decision of serious\nquestions which are totally outside the scope of the\nsuit would have to be gone into. As the decree of a suit\nfor specific performance of the contract for sale, if\npassed, cannot, at all, affect the right, title and\ninterest of Respondents 1 and 4 to 11 in respect of the\ncontracted property and in view of the detailed\ndiscussion made hereinearlier, Respondents 1 and 4 to\n11 would not, at all, be necessary to be added in the\n\nPage 28 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ninstant suit for specific performance of the contract for\nsale.\"\n\nThat thereafter, after observing and holding as above,\nthis Court further observed that in view of the principle\nthat the plaintiff who has filed a suit for specific\nperformance of the contract to sell is the dominus litis,\nhe cannot be forced to add parties against whom, he\ndoes not want to fight unless it is a compulsion of the\nrule of law.\n\n5.4. In the aforesaid decision in the case of Kasturi\n(supra), it was contended on behalf of the third parties\nthat they are in possession of the suit property on the\nbasis of their independent title to the same and as the\nplaintiff had also claimed the relief of possession in\nthe plaint and the issue with regard to possession is\ncommon to the parties including the third parties, and\ntherefore, the same can be settled in the suit itself. It\nwas further submitted on behalf of the third parties\nthat to avoid the multiplicity of the suits, it would be\nappropriate to join them as party defendants. This\nCourt did not accept the aforesaid submission by\nobserving that merely in order to find out who is in\npossession of the contracted property, a third party or\na stranger to the contract cannot be added in a suit for\nspecific performance of the contract to sell because\nthey are not necessary parties as there was no\nsemblance of right to some relief against the party to\nthe contract. It is further observed and held that in a\nsuit for specific performance of the contract to sell the\nlis between the vendor and the persons in whose favour\nagreement to sell is executed shall only be gone into\nand it is also not open to the Court to decide whether\nany other parties have acquired any title and\npossession of the contracted property.\n\n5.5. It is further observed and held by this Court in\nthe aforesaid decision that if the plaintiff who has\nfiled a suit for specific performance of the contract to\nsell, even after receiving the notice of claim of title\nand possession by other persons (not parties to the\nsuit and even not parties to the agreement to sell for\nwhich a decree for specific performance is sought)\n\nPage 29 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ndoes not want to join them in the pending suit, it is\nalways done at the risk of the plaintiff because he\ncannot be forced to join the third parties as party-\ndefendants in such suit. The aforesaid observations\nare made by this Court considering the principle that\nplaintiff is the dominus litis and cannot be forced to\nadd parties against whom he does not want to fight\nunless there is a compulsion of the rule of law.\n\n5.6. Therefore, considering the decision of this\nCourt in the case of Kasturi (supra), the appellant\ncannot be impleaded as a defendant in the suit filed\nby the original plaintiffs for specific performance of\nthe contract between the original plaintiffs and\noriginal defendant no.1 and in a suit for specific\nperformance of the contract to which the appellant is\nnot a party and that too against the wish of the\nplaintiffs. The plaintiffs cannot be forced to add party\nagainst whom he does not want to fight. If he does so,\nin that case, it will be at the risk of the plaintiffs.\"\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has further submitted that if the original owners\nare joined, nature of the suit will be converted into the suit\nfor enforcement of the ATS between the farmers and the\nsociety and even otherwise, as per ATS, onus is on the\nsociety to get the sale deeds executed from the farmers.\n\nThe appellant has stated that in the suit filed by the\nappellant against the original owners of the land, it has\nbeen stated that the appellant has right in the suit land by\nvirtue of ATS, power of attorney, development agreement\nwith the original owners and it has paid full consideration to\nthe original owners and they have transferred the\npossession to the society and therefore, when the purchaser\n\nPage 30 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nhas right to compel the defendant society to procure the\nconcurrence and decree against the present appellant with a\ndirection to get the conveyance from the original owners and\nexecute in favour of the respondent can be passed.\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent on the point of non-joinder of allottees has\nsubmitted that the so-called allottees are strangers to the\nATS and MOU and they are not proper and necessary. It is\nsubmitted that there is no pleadings by the appellants -\ndefendants as to who were the allottees in the suit land\nprior to 22/12/1960 and no documents of allotment of\nsociety were produced and only list of allottees has been\nproduced on record which is a typed list prepared by the\nsociety, which is false and has inherent contradictions and\nis not supported by any evidence and the said list does not\nprovide any particulars of the allottees and shows old and\nnew plot numbers and as such, the allotment letters do not\ncreate any right in the suit land.\n\nIt is also contended by Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior\nadvocate for the respondent that the society has filed Civil\nSuit No.941 of 2011 against the allottees and the society\nhas stated that the allottees are provisional allottees and\nnot accepted as members by the society, as they have not\npaid the land contribution and allottees are mere allottees\nand not the members of the society and they are not\nnecessary parties and if the allottees are the members of the\n\nPage 31 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nsociety, then they are not necessary parties. As the\nmembers of the society have not individual right and they\nare required to be represented through the society. If they\nare nominal members/nominal allottee than under the ATS,\nit is the obligation undertaken by the society to compensate\nthem and clear the title and sell the land to the plaintiff.\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of\nState of U.P. Vs. C.O.D. Chheoki\nEmployees Co-operative Housing Society Ltd. and\nothers\n, reported in (1997) 3 SCC 681. Paragraph Nos.16,\n17 and 18 of the said judgements are as under:-\n\n\"16. Thus, it is settled law that no citizen has\nan fundamental right under\nArticle 19(1)(c)\nto become a\nmember of a Co-operative Society. His right is governed\nby the provisions of the statute. So, the right to become\nor to continue being a member of the society is a\nstatutory right. On fulfilment of the qualifications\nprescribed to become a member and for being a member\nof the society and on admission, he becomes a member.\nHis being a member of the society is subject to the\noperation of the Act, rules and bye-laws applicable\nfrom time to time. A member of the Society has no\nindependent right qua the Society and it is the society\nthat is entitled to represent as the corporate aggregate.\nNo individual member is entitled to assail the\nconstitutionality of the provisions of the Act, rules and\nthe bye-laws as he has his right under the Act, rules\nand bye-laws and is subject to its operation. The stream\ncannot rise higher than the source.\n\n17. So, the society having been formed is governed\nby the provisions of the Act. The individual members do\nnot have any fundamental right to the management of\nthe Committee except in accordance with the provisions\n\nPage 32 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nof the Act, rules and bye-laws. The management of the\nCommittee is regulated by\nSection 29\nof the Act. The\ncomposition thereof is also regulated by the Act and\nhas to be in accordance with the Rules and the bye-\nlaws. The Rules referred to here in before have to be in\nfurtherance of and in conformity with the provisions\ncontained in\nSection 130(2)(xii)\nand (xii-A) and the Rules\nproviding for reservation in the election of the\ncommittee or for nomination to the Management\nCommittee of the members belonging to the weaker\nsections and women should be to effectuate socio-\neconomic and political justice assured by the Preamble,\n\nArticles 38\nand\nof the Constitution.\n\n18. Shri Raju Ramachandran, relying upon the\njudgment of this Court in\nDamyanti Naranga vs. The\nUnion of India & Ors.\n[(1971) 1 SCC 678], has contended\nthat in view of the ration\nlaid down by\nthis Court, the\nGovernment is devoid of power to make law unless any\nof the restrictions as controlled by clause (4) of\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India are infringed. The\nGovernment has no power to enact a law incorporating\nthe reservation to the members of weaker sections and\nwomen thereof. We find no force in the contention. It\ncould be seen that therein, the Government had enacted\nthe\nSahitya Sammelan Act\nexercising the power under\nEntry 63, List I of the Seventh Schedule to the\nConstitution. This Court pointed out that the Act did\nnot envisage that the Samiti is of national importance.\nTherefor, it was held that the Parliament had lacked\npower to enact the law incorporating the society and\ninducting outside members against the wishes of the\nfounder members of the Society registered under the\n\nSocieties Registration Act\n. This Court also held that the\nproperties belonging to the original Society stood\nvested in the Society incorporated under\nSection 4\nof\nthe Act without any compensation. Therefore, it was\nviolative of\nArticle 31\nof the Constitution of India, as it\nstood then. The ratio therein has no application to the\nfacts in this case. He then contended that \"Other\nBackward Classes\" defined under the State Public\nServices Reservation Act applicable to and covering the\npublic services, they are being inducted as members of\nthe society which are otherwise not eligible and,\ntherefore, the induction of them by amendment of Rules\nmade on 15.7.1994 is unconstitutional. In support\n\nPage 33 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthereof, he contends that though\nArticle 15(4)\nof the Act\nprovides that it is subject to\nArticles 15(2)\nand\n29(2)\nof\nthe Constitution, it does not envisage that it is also\nsubject to\nArticle 19(1)(c)\nof the Constitution. Therefore,\nthe reservation provided to the weaker sections is\nunconstitutional. We find no force in the contention.\nThe object of\nArticle 15(4)\nis to lift the prohibition of\ngeneral equality guaranteed in\nArticle 15(2)\nand\n29(2)\n\nof the Constitution dealing with the right to admission\ninto an educational institution maintained by the State\nor receiving aid from the State. Therefore, their object\nis distinct and different from\nArticle 19(1)(c).\nThough\n\nArticle 19(1)(c)\ngives freedom to form association, it is\ncontrolled by the provisions of the Act. As held by this\nCourt, once a society has been registered under the Act,\nthe management of the society through\nSection 29\nand\nthe Rules made thereunder, is regulated by duly elected\nmembers. In the democratic set up, all eligible persons\nare entitled to contest the election, as held, according\nto the provisions of the Act and Rules. In the absence of\nelected members belonging to the weaker sections and\nwomen elected, nomination of them by the Government\nis the alternative dispensation envisaged as one of the\npolicies of the Act. Therefore, the Court cannot\ninterfere with the policy and declare it is\nunconstitutional violating\nArticle 19(1)(c)\nof the\nConstitution.\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has also relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of\nDaman Singh & Ors vs State Of\nPunjab & Ors.\n, reported in (1985) 2 SCC 670.\n\n7.3 Finding on the point of non-joinder of the parties :\n\nSo far as the submission of the respective parties on\nthe point of non-joinder of the parties is concerned, here in\nthis case, considering the submissions of both the sides, the\nrectal in the ATS clearly provides that the allottees are to be\n\nPage 34 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nremoved from the land. Thus, it is apparent that at the time\nof ATS, allottees were in the suit land, which was in the\nknowledge of the respondent - plaintiff.\n\nIt is admitted fact on record and it cannot be disputed\nthat the transfer or the enforcement of the ATS was based\nupon the conveyance of the land from the original owners to\nthe appellant plaintiff. The owners was to convey the land\nand those lands were to be handed over to the respondent.\nIt is also made out that the lands were allotted to other\npersons who are third party or non-members, however,\nwhether they are legal members of the society or not, it is a\nquestion apart but they were allottees on the land. It is also\nadmitted fact that the appellant - original defendant has\nfiled suit against the original owners of the land, which is\npending and it has not attained finality. Admittedly, the\nMOU which is to be enforced also clarifies that 75% of the\nland will be of the respondent and 25% shall belong to\nMr.Ashish Patel.\n\nIn the case of Mashkoor Hasan Khan (supra), in para\n1, 2, & 3, it has been held and observed as follows:\n\n\"2. lt may be noted that the actual bidders or\nthe persons in whose favour the rights have\nnow been granted by the Zila Parishad were not\nimplemented as parties to the suit nor in\nParishad wean interim injunction made in the\nsuit. They are not impleaded in this appeal\neither. In the counter affidavit filed on behalf\nof the Zila Parishad it has been stated that\n\nPage 35 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwritten contracts had already been entered\ninto by the Zila Parishad for collection of\ncarcass, bones and hides etc. with third parties\nwho are not parties to the suit or to this\nappeal.\n\n3. It is thus obvious that in case any injunction\nis granted it will adversely affect the interest\nof third parties who are not present before this\nCourt. In these circumstances the interim\ninjunction was not in fact maintainable and it\nwas not necessary for the court below to go\ninto the merits of the application.\"\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\nSimilarly, in the case of\nSajli Kishku\n(supra), it has\nbeen observed as under:-\n\n\"...In the absence of a necessary party the suit\nis not maintainable unless the defect is cured.\n\n16. It is a settled principle of law that an order\nof injunction like all interim orders is passed\nonly in aid of the final order that may be\npassed in the suit. But where as here the suit\nitself is not maintainable the court should\nrestrain itself from passing any interim order.\"\n\nIt is on record that the allottees / members whether\nthey are legal or illegal, is yet to be decided but prima facie,\nthere are allotments in the name of other persons.\n\nThe owners against whom the suit is filed are also not\njoined. No doubt, it is an obligation on the society to get the\nland conveyed in favour of the society by the original owner\n\nPage 36 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nfor which the suit is also filed, but if the appellant fails to\nget the conveyance of the land from the original owners,\nrights of the respondent cease to exist. On the contrary, if\nthe owners were joined, they could have come before the\ntrial court and have cleared the obligation of the appellant -\ndefendant. There appears to be some hinch between the\nappellant and the original owners which would have given\nrise to the cause of action to file the suit against the\noriginal owners. As such the original owners unless and\nuntil they do not convey the land, there is no possibility of\nreconveyance of land to the respondent.\n\nSo far as contention of the respective parties with\nrespect to non-joinder of Mr.Ashish Patel is concerned, as\nper the MOU Mr.Ashish Patel has 25% share in the land. As\nstated above, the respondents' case is that there is no\nnovation and clause 7(d) is between Mr.Ashish Patel and the\nrespondent and not the appellant and the respondent and\nhence there is no change in the ATS between the parties.\nBut as Mr.Ashish Patel has not signed individually, as share\nof Mr.Ashish Patel to the extent of 25% in the MOU, cannot\nbe conveyed to the respondent without joining Mr.Ashish\nPatel, as he is also an affected party to the suit. By virtue of\nphrase \"banne tarafwala\", Mr.Ashish Patel becomes one of\nthe parties of the said phrase. Hence, the performance of\nthe MOU, which is sought by the respondent, cannot be\ndecided without having Mr.Ashish Patel as party.\n\nPage 37 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nSo far as the allotments are concerned, in 2006 itself,\nthe allottees were there to whom allotment letters have been\nissued, however, it is an admitted fact that the allotment\ndastavej to all the members are not executed. Though it is\ncontended by Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned counsel for the\nrespondent that the allottees are not the members of the\nsociety and if they are members of the society, the society\nwill take care of their rights and interest. But this fact also\ncannot be denied that a list of the allottees has been placed\non record by the society. Whether the allottees are legally or\nillegally on the land is a question which cannot be decided\nby this Court, but when the ATS says that allottees are to\nbe removed or the allotments are to be cancelled, it becomes\nan act which affects the rights of the allottees, who are on\nthe land since long and they are waiting for getting their\nallotment dastavaj. It also reveals that common amenities\nhave been provided on the land, brochure of the society is\nalso placed on record and so the allotttes who are members\nor non-members of the land, they have right in the land in\nthe common amenities and hence they have undecided\nrights in the suit land. If they are removed without any legal\naction, it will be hardship to the allottees and they cannot\nbe removed without following process of law and admittedly\n\nin that case\nthe allottees have to agitate their grievance in\nthe suit.\n\nIn the case of Shivali (Vejalpur) Co-Op.Hosg.\nSociety\nLtd.\n(supra), in paragraph Nos. 9 & 10, it has been observed\n\nPage 38 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nand held as under :-\n\n\"9 In my opinion when a housing society\nissues the allotment letters in favour of its\nmembers with reference to its respective\nunits/shares an interest in the same will be\nsaid to have been created in favour of its\nmembers. Even in the case of a tenant\ncopartnership society or a tenant\ncoownership society, where the land is\nsupposed to be owned by the society and\nupon which houses are constructed by the\nsociety for the benefit of its members or by\nthe members themselves, as the case may be\nand when allotment letter is issued in favour\nof an individual member, in such cases also,\ninterest in the immovable property to be\noccupied is always created.\n\n10. A letter of allotment is an an areement to\nsell immovable ' property as the possession\nof the property is transferred to the\npurchaser before or at the time of or\nsubsequent to the execution letter of\nallotment of the society is a transfer of\ninterest of the society to a third party who,\nsubsequently, becomes a member. In the case\nof a housing society, the right of occupation\nand enjoyment of the plot allotted to the\nmember is vested to him. Under the\nprovisions of the\nGujarat Co-operative\nSocieties Act\na society and its member/s are\nindependent of each other. Both are mutually\nexclusive. A society can exist even in the\nabsence of its members and it can include an\ny personas its members. A co-operative\nsociety is formed in order to allow its\nmember/s to execute their requirements and\nto avail the benefits jointly, which is not\n\nPage 39 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nfeasible or possible individually. Therefore\nthere is no substance in the contention\nraised by the petitioners that a society and\nits members are not independent of each\nother.\n\n[Emphasis Supplied]\n\nSo far as the contention raised by Mr.Mihir Joshi,\nlearned counsel for the respondent that the appellant\nsociety has filed the suit against some of the allottees in\norder to argue that the appellant does not recognize the\nrights or interest of the allottees, it is made out from the\nplaint itself that the appellant has reframed its obligation to\nexecute allotment dastavej in favour of the allottees, once\nthe remaining balance consideration is paid. Hence, the suit\nwhich is filed by the society against the allottees also reveals\nthe fact that the allottees are on the land prior to filing of\nthe present suit and the society was keen to confirm its\nobligation to execute dastavej on payment of remaining\nbalance consideration and so those allottees who are there\non the land, if removed without due process of law, it will be\nbased upon ATS and it will be hardship to the allottees and\nwho will be affected by the order of this Court and the\nallottees will not be able to use their amenities accordingly\nand so it will be affecting their rights in their absence.\n\nMr.Joshi, learned senior advocate has relied on the\ndecision in the case of\nGurmit Singh Bhatia\n(supra),\nwherein the vendee and the subsequent purchaser claimed\n\nPage 40 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrights on the basis of different agreements with the vendor.\nAs the agreements were different and also because the\nsubsequent purchaser was claiming independent title\nadverse to the vendor, the subsequent purchaser was not\nimplemented at the risk of the vendee, hence the facts of the\ncase cited by the learned senior advocate for the respondent\nare different, whereas in this case, the rights of the\nrespondent depends on the agreement that the appellant\nhas with the original owners and as stated above, if the\nappellant's suit against the original owners fails, the alleged\nright of the respondent will also ceased to exist and\nin that\ncase\nalso the owners becomes necessary party and as\nmentioned above, if they are brought as owners on record, it\nwould have been convenient for the respondent to get\nconveyance in their favour through the appellant.\n\nIn the case of\nC.O.D. Chheoki Employees'\nCooperative Socieety Limited and others\n(supra), and in\nthe case of\nDaman Singh\n(supra) it is laid down that the\nmembers of the society do not have any independent right\nin the co-operative society or the appointment of the\nchairman was being challenged and the Hon'ble Apex Court\nobserved that the members cannot challenge the Act or bye-\nlaws or the rules by which they exist and they do not have\nany independent rights in the society.\n\nParagraph 11 of\nDaman Singh\n(Supra) states that members under the\nrelevant\nCo-operative Societies Act\nin the case, are also\n\nPage 41 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ngiven the chance to be heard if they wish to be heard,\nindicating that persons do not lose their individuality after\nbecoming a member.\n\n8.1. Finding on readiness and willingness\nu/s 16\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act:\n\nSo far as the contentions of both the parties with\nrespect to the readiness and willingness\nu/s 16\nof the\nSpecific Relief Act is concerned, it is the issue wherein the\nplaintiff and the respondent has to discharge their duties to\nprove readiness and willingness to perform their part of the\ncontract by adducing cogent and convincing evidence\nbefore the learned trial court and resultantly, if the plaintiff\nis unable to prove readiness and willingness on his part,\nthere will be no order of specific performance of contract in\nfavour of the plaintiff. As such the contents of\nsection 16(1)\n\n(c) pertains to the specific performance. Readiness and\nwillingness is a question of facts and hence, the said\nquestion is kept open to be decided by the learned trial\ncourt and this Court has not dealt with the same.\n\n9. UNAMENDED SECTIONS 13 AND 14 OF THE\nSPECIFIC RELIEF ACT :\n\n9.1 Submission of the appellant on\nSecs.13\nand\nof\nSpecific Relief Act:\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\n\nPage 42 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nappellant, on the point of unamended\nsections 13\nand\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act has submitted that the specific\nperformance of the ATS is not possible under\nsections 13\n\nand\nof the Specific Relief Act.\n\nIt is submitted that there are three parties in this case\nhaving their rights and interest in the suit land, namely,\nthe original owners, Mr.Ashish Patel and allottees /\nmembers of the society. It is submitted that as per\nsection\n13(1)(b)\nof the Specific Relief Act neither of the three parties\nare \"bound to concur\" or \"bound to convey\" at the request of\nthe appellant society and therefore ATS cannot be\nperformed under\nsection 13\nof the Specific Relief Act.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant has further submitted that where compensation is\nadequate relief, specific performance of the contract is not\nenforceable and that under\nsection 41(h)\nof the Specific\nRelief Act, an injunction cannot be granted when\nequally efficacious relief can certainly be obtained by\nany other usual mode of proceedings.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant has further submitted that the respondent has\nadmitted in the plaint itself that the respondent is having\nbusiness of selling, purchasing and developing the land\nrelated activities. It is also admitted in the plaint that even\nin the past, the respondent had purchased the property\nfrom Mr.Ashish Patel. Furthermore, in the suit itself, the\nrespondent has prayed that the sale deed of the suit land\n\nPage 43 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nmay be executed in favour of any one proposed by the\nrespondent, which indicates that the respondent is satisfied\nwith compensation and is not concerned with the suit land\nfor his own use.\n\nClause 7(d) also states that the suit land is to be\njointly sold by the appellant and the respondent to third\nparty. As such the agreement by way of MOU is an\nagreement for developing the land and selling it to the third\nparty and therefore, injunction cannot be granted for such\nan agreement in such a situation. If the suit land will have\nto be \"merchandise\" or \"stock-in-trade\" of the respondent, in\nwhich case, presumption will not be available to the\nrespondent and in such a case, the respondent can be\ncompensated in terms of money, as the respondent is\nconcerned with profit after selling the land. It is apparent,\nthat the compensation in form of money would suffice. The\nrespondent is concerned with profit and therefore,\npresumption is also not applicable to the facts of the\npresent case and injunction ought not to have been granted.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of Hari Krishna Agarwala Vs. k.c. Gupta,\nreported in 1948 SCC OnLine Allahabad 183.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the\nappellant has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble\nApex Court in the case of\nRamji vs. Rao Kishoresingh\n,\nreported in 1972 SCC Online Privy Council 40.\n\nPage 44 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas further submitted that unamended\nsection 14(1)(a)\nof\nthe Specific Relief Act stipulates that the contract which can\nbe adequately compensated through money in case of non-\nperformance, cannot be enforced.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of\nDave Ramshankar Jivatram vs. Bai\nKailasgauri\n, reported in 1972 SCC OnLine (Gujarat) 61,\nwherein it has been observed and held in para 7 as under:-\n\n\"7. .....Plaintiff No. 1 does not require the\nsuit house for her own residence and that is\nthe material fact Even before the date of the\ninstitution of the suit she had entered into an\nagreement of sale with original plaintiffs Nos 2\nand 3 and executed a banakhat Exhibit 25\ndated February 14, 1963 The agreement of sale\nis consideration of Rs 11.999 and Rs 501 has\nbeen given as an earnest money as stated in the\ndocument it is stated in the plaintiff No 1 has\nentered into an agreement of sale of the suit\nproperty on 14-2- 1963 with plaintiffs Nos 2\nand 3.

The sale is to be for\na price of Rs.11.999 thus what she wants is the\nmoney value of the property of the property.\nThe defendant has purchased the property for\na sum of Rs 5,999 He is entitled to make\nrepairs and insure other expenses the extent of\nRs 751 as provided for in the agreement of sale\nExhibit 25 Banakhat dated 14-2-1963. The sale\nis to be for a price of Rs 11,999. Thus what she\nwants is the money value of the property. The\ndefendant has purchased the property for a\nsum of Rs.5,999. He is entitled to make repairs\nand incur other expenses, the extent of Rs 751,\nas provided for in the agreement of\nreconveyance. Ex. 27. the deference, therefore,\nwould be only of Rupees 5,249. The plaintiff No\n1 would thus be adequately compensated in\nmoney if I decree an award of Rs. 5,249 in her\nfavour, as compensation in money for the\nadmitted breach of the specific performance if\nthe agreement to reconvey evidenced by the\ndocument.

In other words, the specific\nperformance of the agreement by the\nappellants entering into an agreement with a\nthird party; and (ii) appellants being in a\nposition to compel such third party to perform\nher obligations under such agreement.\n\n17. The High Court ought to have seen that\nthe specific performance of the Agreement in\nquestion comprised of two parts namely, (i) the\ndefendant entering into an agreement with his\nbrother's wife for the purchase of a land for\nproviding access to the land agreed to be sold\nunder the suit Agreement of Sale; and (ii) the\ndefendant thereafter executing a sale deed\nconveying the property covered by the suit\nAgreement of Sale.\n\n20. Even the limited rights conferred by\n\nSection 13(1)(b)\nof the Specific Relief Act are\nnot available to the respondent, as there was\nno legal right in the defendant to compel 3 rd\nparties to convey their land to him for the\npurpose of providing a pathway to the land\nagreed to be sold to the respondent herein.\n\nSection 13(1)(b)\nreads as follows:\n\n\"13. Rights of purchaser or lessee against\nperson with no title or imperfect title.--(1)\nWhere a person contracts to sell or let certain\nimmovable property having no title or only an\nimperfect title, the purchaser or lessee (subject\nto the other provisions of this Chapter), has\nthe following rights namely:-\n\n(a) xxx xxx xxx\n\nPage 48 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n(b) where the concurrence of other persons is\nnecessary for validating the title, and they are\nbound to concur at the request of the vendor or\nlessor, the purchaser or lessee may compel\nhim to procure such concurrence, and when a\nconveyance by other persons is necessary to\nvalidate the title and they are bound to convey\nat the request of the vendor or lessor, the\npurchaser or lessee may compel him to procure\nsuch conveyance;\"\n\nIt is submitted that in view of the above, specific\nperformance of the ATS is not possible.\n\n9.2 Submission of the respondent on unamended\n\nsections 13\nand\nof the Specific Relief Act :\n\nPer contra, Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for\nthe respondent, on the point of unamended sections of\n\nsections 13\nand\nof the Specific Relief Act, has contended\nthat no individual concurrence of the allottees is required\nover and above the concurrence of Mr.Ashish Patel is also\nnot required because he has 25% share in the land, only\nafter the society as well as land to the respondent and right\nof Mr.Ashish Patel flows from the respondent and not from\nthe society. It is also submitted that the owners are bound\nto sell the land to the society and concur and as per the\nATS, owners are bound to concur on demand of the society\nas the society has paid the entire sale consideration. It is\nsubmitted that the society who has filed the suit against the\nallottees have prayed for injunction regarding non-transfer\n\nPage 49 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nof the suit land in favour of third party. As such there is no\nrequirement for the allottees also to validate the title.\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent, on the point of\nsection 14(1)(a)\n, has submitted\nthat\nsection 14(1)(a)\napplies to general contract like contract\nfor movable properties and so far as immovable properties\nare concerned,\nsection 10\nspecifically provides that unless\nand until contradictory is proved, general presumption that\nbreach of contract of transfer of immovable property cannot\nbe adequately relief by compensation and this presumption\ncan be rebutted only if contrary is proved in the trial, decree\nof possession of exception to the general rule and here in\nthis case, as the dispute is with respect to immovable\nproperty and therefore, such a contention is not there. It is\nalso submitted that the party coming to the Court for\nspecific performance of the contract of sale of immovable\nproperty need not prove anything unless the otherside is\nremoved the presumption. After evidence is led to remove\nthe presumption, the plaintiff is still in a position to prove\nby other evidence in case that payment that payment of\nmoney does nto compensate him adequately. It is also\nsubmitted that\nsection 14(1)(d)\nis not applicable to the facts\nof the case and does not run into minute details and does\nnot involve personal qualification or volition of the parties.\nSimilarly, it does not involve continuous duties which Court\ncannot supervise. The transaction is simple in nature for\nwhich\nsection 14(1)(d)\nis not applicable and is raised only to\n\nPage 50 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\navoid the obligation.\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has placed reliance on the decision of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nM.L. Devender Singh\nand others vs. Syed Khaja\n, reported in (1973) 2 SCC 515,\nwherein in para 21 it has been observed and held as\nunder :-\n\n\"21. The second assumption underlying\nthe contentions on behalf of the\nDefendants-appellants is that, once the\npresumption, contained in explanation to\n\nSection 12\nof the old Act, is removed, the,\nbar contained in\nSection 21\nof the old Act,\nagainst the specific enforcement of a\ncontract for which compensation in money\nis an adequate relief, automatically\noperates, over-looks that the condition for\nthe imposition of the bar is actual proof\nthat compensation in money is adequate on\nthe facts and circumstances of a particular\ncase before the Court. The effect of the\npresumption is that the party coming to\nCourt for the specific performance of a\ncontract for sale of unmovable property\nneed not prove anything until the other\nside has removed the presumption. After\nevidence is led to remove the presumption,\nthe plaintiff may still be in a position to\nprove, by other evidence in the case, that\npayment of money does not compensate\nhim adequately.\"\n\n9.3. Finding on the aspect of unamended\nsections 13\n\nPage 51 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nand 14 of the\nSpecific Relief Act\n:\n\nHearing both the sides on the point of concurrence and\nconveyance under\nsection 13\nof the Specific Relief Act, it is\nnot only the person who can transfer his right / title is\nrelevant but also the person who can validate the title is\nalso important. Admittedly, the allottees / members who are\non the land have their valuable rights in the suit land\nincluding the ownership over the plot and undivided share\nin the basic amenities and services of the society, their\nconcurrence is required to validate the title to passed on to\nthe respondent. The allottees / members who are on the\nsuit land are not bound to concur at the request of the\nappellant and hence\nsection 13(1)(b)\ncomes into picture\nunless and until the allottees / members themselves come\nforward to validate the title, ATS cannot be enforced and as\nstated above, without due procedure of law, the allottees /\nmembers cannot be removed from the land. Regarding\nconcurrence of Mr.Ashish Patel is concerned, as per MOU\nwhich is subsequent even taken place after execution of the\nATS, Mr.Ashish Patel has become owner of the suit land to\nthe extent of 25% and in the opinion of this Court,\nconcurrence is required of Mr.Ashish Patel to validate the\nappellant's title to be passed to the respondent and it\ncannot be denied that Mr.Ashish Patel also is not bound to\nconcur at the request of the appellant.\n\nMoreover, so far as 25% and 75% share, as per MOU is\nconcerned, which part of the land is of the respondent and\n\nPage 52 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwhich part is of MOU is also not clarified. The concurrence\nto that effect for demarcation of the land is also required\nand here also\nsections 13\nand\ncomes into picture.\n\nAs per submission of Mr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant, it is open for the appellant to get\nconcurrence and in that manner indirectly it is a statement\nregarding appellant's right to sue against all the person\nfrom whom concurrence is required.\n\nIf the respondent is having ATS which is to be enforced\nwhether the Court can issue the decree compelling the\nappellant to obtain concurrence from the persons who are\nbound to concur as per the say of the respondent?. and if\nthat is so, the appellant will have to initiate litigation\nagainst the original owners which is subject to their\npersonal volition of the appellant. In that sense,\nsection\n14(d)\nof the Specific Relief Act comes into picture, where the\nCourt is to issue a decree compelling the appellant to\npursue litigation, it would involve numerous details and\nperformance of the continuous which court cannot\nsupervise continuously. Assuch, it will be a chaos on record\ncompelling the appellant to get enforcement of the ATS of\nthe respondent by suing the owners, allottees and original\nowners of the land which again cannot be specific\nenforcement under\nsection 14(1)(d)\n.\n\nConsidering the submissions of both the sides and as\nstated above, three parties in total are affected in this case,\n\nPage 53 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nnamely original owners, Mr.Ashish Patel and the allottees\nand as per\nsection 13(1)(b)\n, as mentioned, bound to\nconcurrence cannot be said to be a ground for right to sue\nagainst all the persons and create litigations and also as\nstated above, it will cast obligation where the Court will not\nbe able to issue decree which will compel the appellant to\nobtain concurrence without legal procedure of law and if\nthat is so, the court issue decree compelling the appellant to\npursue litigation it will involve numerous details and\npurpose of a continuous duty, which will have to be\nsupervised and which can be said to be against\nsection 14\n\nof the Specific Relief Act, as the Court will have to supervise\non one side conveyance of the deed from the allottees to the\nappellant, owners' conveyance towards the appellant and\nthereafter all the lands if is vested in the appellant it shall\nbe conveyed to the respondent. As such\nsection 14\nalso, as\nstated above has a role to play.\n\n10. CAN COMPENSATION BE AN ADQUATE REMEDY:\n\nSo far as the submission regarding compensation\nbeing adequate remedy is concerned, the respondent\nhimself has admitted in the plaint that the respondent is in\nthe business of purchasing, selling and developing the land.\nThe MOU which is produced on record, clause 7(d) also\nstates that the land is to develop jointly by Mr.Ashish Patel\nand the respondent and so MOU becomes impliedly a joint\ndevelopment agreement between the parties. It has come on\n\nPage 54 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nrecord that the respondent has not asked the land for his\nown use but he is asking the land exclusively for selling\nahead, which cannot be denied. It is a business of\npurchasing, selling and developing of the land of the\nrespondent.\n\nThis court is in complete agreement with the\nproposition of law that under\nsection 10\nof the Specific\nRelief Act which shows that unless and until contrary is\nproved, Court shall presume that the breach of a contract to\ntransfer immovable property cannot be adequate relief by\ncompensation in money. Here in this case, when the\nrespondent has admitted that they are dealing in\npurchasing, selling and developing the land activities and\nwhen they do not require the land for their own, but it is\nonly for the merchandise, this admission itself need not to\nbe proved. In these circumstances, if specific performance is\ndenied, apparently the respondent is entitled for\ncompensation which can be calculated in terms of money.\nThe admission of the respondent itself shows that the\nrespondent is only concerned with the profit after selling\nthe land and when the respondent is not using the land for\nhis own purpose and will be selling and developing the land\nfor profit, presumption cannot be made applicable.\n\nSo far as the decision in the case of\nSyed Khaja\n\n(supra) is concerned\n,\nin that case\nthe defendant relied on a\nclause in the contract providing for liquidated damages in\ncase of breach for presumption. Here in this case,\n\nPage 55 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\npresumption shall not apply on account of admission of the\nrespondent. In the present proceedings regarding their\nbusiness of purchasing, selling and developing the land\nactivities and their intention is on record to sell and develop\nthe suit land and that also for profit.\n\nNow a days it cannot be ruled out that in such\nproceedings, when the land is agreed to be sold and\nagreement is executed but is never concurred to be enforced\nupon and thereafter, due to some dispute between the\nparties, litigation takes place, the main dispute is hike in\nthe price of the land.\n\nThe respondent has invested money and the return of\nmoney is sufficient which cannot be termed to be their\nprofit. This court do agree with the submission of\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant that\ncompensation can be adequately given to the respondent.\n\nBased upon the case of\nDave Ramshankar\n(supra),\nwhen the facts indicated that the plaintiff No.1 did not\nrequire suit land for her own use and she only wanted to\nreconvey the property, compensation of money is adequate\nrelief. In such a case, contract cannot be specifically\nenforced.\n\n10. PRINCIPLES OF GRANT OF INJUNCTION :\n\nSo far as the principles of grant of injunction is\nconcerned, it is submitted by Mr.Soparkar, learned senior\nadvocate for the appellant that the impugned order is\n\nPage 56 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nagainst the settled principles for grant of injunction. It is\nsubmitted that in case the impugned order is not vacated,\nthe appellant will face criminal and civil proceedings filed by\nthe allottees / members of the appellant society, who have\nbeen allotted plots way back in the year 1996, as many\nallotment dastavej are yet to be executed in favour of the\nallottees and therefore, irreparable loss or injury will be\ncaused to the appellant rather than the respondent. It is\nalso submitted that the allottees / members of the society\nhave also initiated proceedings against the appellants and\neven the respondent has also initiated proceedings, which\nultimately resulted into the cancellaton of the sale deed for\nsurvey nos.227 and 228. It is also submitted that the\nrespondent never agitated and neither sought to agitate the\ninjunction application for 9 years and therefore, the\nrespondent cannot contend now that irreparable injury will\ncause to it and for that balance of convenience lies in\nfavourof the respondent. It is the case of the respondent\nthat application under\nOrder 7 Rule 11 of the Code of Civil\nProcedure\nwas pending and hence there is no delay on the\npart of the respondent. However, it cannot be denied that\nthe respondent was aware that the suit land was being\nallotted to the allottees and subsequent allotment dastavej\nwere being executed, which reveals from the list which has\nbeen produced on record by the appellant and the\nrespondent never requested the court to agitate the\ninjunction application. The conduct of the respondent\n\nPage 57 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nshows that the respondent was never interested in\ninjunction but the respondent was interested with sharing\nprofit only.\n\nIt is also submitted by Mr.Soparkar that in the year\n2021-2022, as per the say of the respondent, as the original\nowners of some of the suit land, began executing sale deeds\nin favour of the appellant, the respondent did not seek any\norder for injunction since 2013. However, it was in the\nknowledge of the respondent that survey nos.227 and 228\nwere in the ownership of the appellant but no urgency was\nshown for those 2 survey numbers. Even as on today, the\nrespondent has sought injunction of 100% land though the\nrespondent is not in possession and ownership of 100%\nland. So, the conduct of the respondent is of a nature which\nshows that there is no irreparable injury to the respondent\nfor 9 years and hence there was also not balance of\nconvenience lies in favour of the respondent and as\nsubmitted earlier, when the respondent is having business\nof purchasing, selling and developing the land, they are\nconcerned with the profit and hence no irreparable injury\ncan be caused to them and they can be compensated\nadequately, if the injunction is vacated.\n\nMr.Soparkar, learned senior advocate for the appellant\nhas placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the case of\nMandali Ranganna and others vs. T.\nRamachandra and others\n, reported in (\n2008) 11 SCC 1\nand Kishorsinh Ratansinh Jadeja vs. Maruti Corpn\n.\n\nPage 58 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\n(2009) 11 SCC 229, wherein the principles of considering\nthe conduct of the parties while exercising its discretionary\njurisdiction is discussed.\n\n11.2. Submission of the respondent on the principle\nof grant of injunction :\n\nPer contra, Mr.Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has submitted that the suit was filed in the year\n2013. It is the case of the respondent that the application\nunder\nOrder 7 Rule 11 of the CPC\nwas pending and it was\nto be heard before the injunction application and\nsubsequently the suit was also transferred from the court of\nAhmedabad to the Court of Sanand. From 2013 to 2020, the\nsociety had no other land and the defendant society got 8\nsurvey numbers in the year 2020, 2021 and 2022 and at\nthis stage, the plaintiff immediately moved an application\nfor hearing of the injunction application and thereafter\nthesuit was dismissed under\nOrder 7 Rule 11 of the CPC\n,\nwhich was challenged by the respondent before this Court\nby way of First Appeal No.2320 of 2022 and thereafter the\napplication was heard and decided and thus, as such, there\nis no delay on the part of the plaintiff.\n\nMr.Joshi, learned advocate for the respondent, on the\npoint of balance of convenience and irreparable injury, has\nsubmitted that there are no allottees / members in the suit\nland and it was the obligation of the society to compensate\nthem and remove them and the society cannot be permitted\n\nPage 59 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nto avoid obligation which is accepted. It is also submitted\nthat the society has not executed convenience in favour of\nthe allottees from 1996 to 2022 for their plots. The allottees\nhave also not preferred any civil or criminal proceedings\nfrom the year 1996 to 2022, which shows that there are no\nallotteees in the society and so the balance of convenience\nand irreparable injury are also in favour of the appellant.\n\nMr.Mihir Joshi, learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent has relied on the case of Maharwal Khewaji\nTrust (regd) vs. Baldev Dass, reported in (2004) 8 SCC\n\n488. Para 10 of\nthe said decision\nis reproduced as under :-\n\n\"10. Be that as it may, Mr. Sachhar is right\nin contending that unless and untill a case of\nirreparable loss or damage is made out by a\nparty to the suit, the court should not permit\nthe nature of the property being changed which\nalso includes alienation or transfer of the\nproperty which may lead to loss or damage\nbeing caused to the party who may ultimately\nsucceed and may further lead to multiplicity of\nproceedings. In the instant case no such case of\nirreparable loss is made out except contending\nthat the legal proceedings are likely to take a\nlong time, therefore, the respondent should be\npermitted to put the scheduled property to\nbetter use. We do not think in the facts and\ncircumstances of this case, the lower appellate\ncourt and the High Court were justified in\npermitting the respondent to change the nature\nof property by putting up construction as also\nby permitting the alienation of the property,\nwhatever may be the condition on which the\nsame is done. In the event of the appellant's\n\nPage 60 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nclaim being found baseless ultimately, it is\nalways open to the respondent to claim\ndamages or, in an appropriate case, the court\nmay itself award damages for the loss suffered,\nif any, in this regard. Since the facts of this\ncase do not make out any extraordinary ground\nfor permitting the respondent to put up\nconstruction and alienate the same, we think\nboth the courts below, namely, the lower\nappellate court and the High Court erred in\nmaking the impugned orders. The said orders\nare set aside and the order of the trial court is\nrestored.\"\n\n11.3. Finding on the principle of grant of\ninjunction, prima facie case, balance of convenience and\nirreparable loss and conduct of the respondent :\n\nUpon hearing the submissions of both the sides on\nprinciple of grant of injunction, prima facie case, balance of\nconvenience and irreparable loss and conduct of the\nrespondent, here in this case, it cannot be disputed that\nthe allottes were allotted plots from the year 1996, whether\nthey are legally members of the society or illegally, is a\nquestion which cannot be decided at this stage, however, it\ncannot be denied that the government record i.e. report of\nthe society conveys that if the submission of the respondent\nis that there were 24 members of the society and four on the\nsuit land, then also, the allottees are there, who are\nmembers. Moreover, as per the say of the appellant, till the\nsuit was filed, 69 registered dastavej have been executed in\n\nPage 61 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nfavour of the appellant, out of 69 allottees, 54 allotment\ndastavejs are of the suit land and after the suit was filed till\n2022, 51 allotment dastavej have been executed, out of\nwhich 35 pertains to the suit land. It is also submitted that\non the suit land bungalows have been constructed and\nmany bungalows are under construction and even a temple\nis also under construction in survey no.218. No doubt, the\nfacts which are narrated in the submissions by the learned\nadvocate for the appellant but no documents are placed on\nrecord by way of evidence and the same can be proved by\nthe appellant in the trial, but baseline cannot be denied\nthat the allottees were there on the land. It can also not be\ndenied that they have been given rights of using common\namenities and other parcels of land. Even for the sake of\narguments, if it is believed that only 24 members were there\nin the society as per the record and only 4 are there in the\nsuit land, but it cannot be denied that the land surrounding\nthe suit land are parcel of the entire suit land and the\nmembers who ever may be in the suit land or other land are\nentitled for the enjoyment of the amenities which cannot be\ndenied. It also cannot be denied that the third party rights\nexists on the suit land, as recorded by the learned trial\ncourt in the impugned order. It is also concluded in the\nimpugned order that the interest of third parties have been\ncreated in the suit land. It is also observed by the learned\ntrial court in the impugned order that the appellant has\nnot acted bonafide with the plaintiff and the allottees of the\n\nPage 62 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nland. If that is so, then it becomes clear that there are\nallottees on the land and the injunction will create a\nsituation wherein the appellant will have to face civil and\ncriminal litigation from the allottees. As such the\ncontentions raised by the learned advocate for the appellant\nthat here is construction on the land by the allottees and as\nper the submission of he learned advocate for the\nrespondent that there are 24 members in the land and 4\nmembers are there in the suit land, then also if any action\nis taken against the legal allottees, it will be a situation for\nthe appellant for facing civil and criminal litigation from the\nallottees which cannot be denied, as it is an admitted fact\nthat in the year 2010 some of the original allottees had\ninitiated legal proceedings against the appellant and the\nrespondent for survey nos.227 and 228 and thereafter,\npartners of the respondent firm in whose favour the land\nwas transferred, decided to cancel sale deed for survey\nnos.227 and 228, considering this aspect also though the\nconveyance for survey nos.227 and 228 were executed in\nfavour of the respondent when the respondent was\ncompelled to cancel those sale deeds at the instance of the\nallottees, it had become a case for agitating dispute by way\nof suit by the respondent. It is also not in dispute that one\nof the partners of the respondent firm signed as a witness in\nallotment dastavaj for plot Nos.15 and 17 which were part\nof extended Radhe Acres Scheme and in the list, serial\nnumber was mentioned which included the suit land and\n\nPage 63 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nallotment dastavej also stated that allottee members owned\ncommon rights and amenities provided by the appellant\nwhich has stated in the suit land.\n\nOver and above, it is required to be noted that in First\nAppeal No.2320 of 2022 vide order dated 6/10/2022, the\nDivision Bench of this Court while allowing the appeal of the\nrespondent and reviving the suit, has observed that so far\nas Annexure-B (from page 134 to 141) is concerned,\nthose are the original allottees. Any transfer in the\ninterregnum by them shall be counted separately. As\nthere is serious dispute in relation to the list 142 to\n\n145. It is volunteered by the learned advocate on\ninstruction that the respondent shall not deal with the\nsaid list for the purpose of transfer of otherwise. It\nbecomes clear that the Division Bench of this Court has\nalso recognized that there are original allottees of the suit\nland who have rights. An arrangement was also proposed\nallowing the appellant to transfer the suit land by\nmaintaining the accounts. Even the Division Bench has\nalso taken into considered the position of allottees and their\nallotments. As such, if the status-quo is continued, it\nwould result into multiplicity of litigation and which will\nresult into irreparable injury to the appellant rather than\nthe respondent in whose knowledge, the fact of allotment\nwas there and who has remained silent.\n\nConsidering overall facts of the case which has not\n\nPage 64 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nbeen considered by the learned trial court, it appears that if\nthe injunction is continued, the allottees have paid their\nconsideration towards their land and allotment dastavej is\nalready executed, which becomes a irreversible situation for\nthe appellant for cancelling the allotments by compensating\nthe rights and taking back the possession without any due\nprocess of law. At the same time, the appellant will have to\nface litigation to that effect against one person i.e.\nrespondent. So considering the balance of convenience and\nirreparable injury, this Court is of the opinion that it\ncoveys more in favour of the appellant rather than\nrespondent, who has a business of selling, purchasing and\ndeveloping the land and has pursue the litigation for profit\nand who can be adequately compensated in terms of\nmoney. At the same time, conduct of the respondent stated\nhereinabove, also tilts the balance of convenience and\nirreparable injury in favour of the appellant who in the\nknowledge of the respondent at the time of executing ATS\nhad allotted some plots to the allottees and it cannot be\ndenied that during the pendency of the suit and till hearing\nof the application, plots were not allotted and till then for 9\nyears when the respondent has remained silent in agitating\nthe injunction application, it appears from the conduct of\nthe respondent that the respondent was concerned about\nagitating the litigation wherein even as per his own say, has\ninvested around Rs.11,49,00,000/-, however, the\nrespondent waited patiently for 9 years and as submitted by\n\nPage 65 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthe learned advocate for the appellant, there are\nconstructions which are carried out in the suit land during\nthese years, which is though not on the record, but cannot\nbe disbelieved as there is already a list of allottees on record\nand so after flowing of much water, if the injunction is\ngranted, it will affect the rights of those persons and it\nwould cause irreparable injury to the appellant and the\nappellant will have to face a lot of hardship. At the same\ntime, balance of convenience is also in favour of the\nappellant rather than the respondent.\n\nAs held in the case of\nMandali Ranganna\n(supra),\nCourt must also take into consideration the conduct of the\nparties while exercising its discretionary jurisdiction while\nconsidering an application for grant of injunction, the court\nwill not only take into consideration the basic elements in\nrelation thereto viz. existence of a prima facie case, balance\nof convenience and irreparable injury. In\nthe said decision\n,\nit is also further held that grant of injunction is an equitable\nrelief and a person who had kept quite for a long time and\nallowed another to deal with the properties exclusively,\nordinarily would not be entitled to an order of injunction.\n\nRelevant paragraph Nos.21, 22 and 26 of the decision\nin the case of\nMandali Ranganna\n(supra) reads thus:\n\n\"21. While considering an application for grant\nof injunction, the court will not only take into\n\nPage 66 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nconsideration the basic elements in relation\nthereto, viz., existence of a prima facie case,\nbalance of convenience and irreparable injury,\nit must also take into consideration the\nconduct of the parties.\n\n22. Grant of injunction is an equitable relief.\nA person who had kept quiet for a long time\nand allowed another to deal with the\nproperties exclusively, ordinarily would not be\nentitled to an order of injunction. The court\nwill not interfere only because the property is a\nvery valuable one.....\n\n26. Rightly or wrongly constructions have\ncome up. They cannot be directed to be\ndemolished at least at this stage. Respondent\n7 is said to have spent three crores of rupees.\nIf that be so, in our opinion, it would not be\nproper to stop further construction.\"\n\nIn the case of\nRamji v. Rao Kishoresingh\n, reported in\n1929 SCC OnLine PC 40, the Hon'ble Court has observed\nand held as follows:\n\n\"It is necessary to refer to two other\nfindings of the learned District Judge -\n\nnamely : (1) that damages would have been an\nadequate relief to the plaintiff, and (2) that\nsuch damages should be Rs.20,000.\n\nIn dealing with this question, learned\njudge said as follows:\n\n\"No special damages have been proved\nby the plaintiff. He simply invested money and\na return of money should normally be\n\nPage 67 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nsufficient. It is not shown that he had any\npressing need for land. On the contrary, from\nthe very nature of the contract, it is evident\nthat there was no hurry at all, and that not\nonly might plaintiff fail to get the land but in\nany case, he could not expect to get it for\nseveral years. Indeed, the only reason for\ninsisting upon specific performance is that the\nvalue of the village now is probably more than\nthe money advanced plus reasonable interest.\nPlaintiff can certainly say that he took a risk\nand that he should be compensated for such\nrisk. But compensation could be given in\nmoney. This ground of appeal must fail.\"\n\nIn the case of Maharwal Khewaji Trust (regd.)\n(supra), relied upon by the learned senior advocate for the\nrespondent, it is held that unless and until a case of\nirreparable loss or damage is made out by a party to the\nsuit, court should not permit a change of the said status-\nquo which may lead to loss or damage, if caused to the\nparty who may ultimately succeed and may further lead to\nmultiplicity of proceedings. In any event, it is open to the\neither party to claim damages if ultimately the case of the\nother party is found baseless and Court may award\ndamages for the loss suffered, if any.\n\nConsidering the aforesaid observations, when a case\nof irreparable injury is made out, status-quo can be\neffected, is the principle laid down. In the present case,\n\nPage 68 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nwhen the respondent is agitating the suit or the injunction\napplication for 9 years, irreparable injury or balance of\nconvenience does not lie in favour of the respondent when\nthere are alienation and allotment in the land prior to filing\nof the suit and after filing of the suit which will affect the\nrights of the allottees as well as will encourage multiplicity\nof litigation against the appellant by the allottees. So far as\nprima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable\nloss are concerned, in the opinion of this Court, it tilts in\nfavour of the appellant rather than the respondent.\n\nConsidering the basic principle of law as\nlaid down in\n\nthe case of\nWander Ltd. And another vs. Antox India P.\nLtd.\n, reported in (1990) Suppl. SCC 727, more particularly\npara 14, as relied upon by Mr.Mihir Joshi, the learned\nadvocate for the respondent, appellate court would\nnormally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of\ndiscretion under appeal solely on the ground that it had\nconsidered the matter at the trial stage, it would have come\nto a contrary conclusion, if the discretion has been\nexercised by the trial court in a reasonable and in a judicial\nmanner, the fact that appellate court would have taken a\ndifferent view may not justify the interference. This court is\nin complete agreement with this principle of law. But it is\nopen for every court to interfere with the impugned order if\nthe findings are found to be non-judicial or perverse, which\ncannot be denied. Here in this case, considering the\n\nPage 69 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nimpugned order, the learned trial court has not considered\nthe facts of the dispute between the parties and therefore,\nthis court has re-examined the facts of the case. The\nlearned trial court has not considered the fact that the\ninjunction ought to have granted when all the three criteria\nare found in favour of the plaintiff namely prima facie case,\nbalance of convenience and irreparable loss, which cannot\nbe compensated in terms of money. At the same time, the\nlearned trial court ought to have come to the conclusion\nthat granting injunction based on the principle that equity\nhelps the person who does equity. Here in this case, the\nlearned trial court has failed to take into consideration the\nfact that even the ATS is there and there was no need for\nMOU to be executed. The fact that the ATS was executed in\nthe year 2006 and though conditions mentioned in the ATS\nand MOU were not fulfilled, how the cause of action arose in\nthe year 2013. The learned trial court also failed to\nconsidered the conduct of the respondent though written\nsubmissions were submitted. The finding that after filing of\nthe suit new allotments have been given, no evidence to that\neffect was brought on record by the respondent and if there\nwas finding that there exists right of third parties in the\nsuit land, the court should have vigilant enough to opine\nclearly upon the balance of convenience and irreparable loss\nwhen there are allottees or third parties rights are existing\nin the suit land, they will be affected by the order of\ninjunction which in enjoying their properties along with\n\nPage 70 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\ncommon amenities. At the same time, it cannot be ruled\nout that if the injunction is operated, it will cause hardship\nto the appellant herein and the appellant will face hardship\nand litigation from the allottees and the same would result\ninto multiplicity of proceedings. The trial court erred that\nthe respondent - plaintiff has prima facie case on the basis\nof ATS only and as the appellant has sought injunction\nagainst the allottees / members in the suit filed by the\nappellants against the allottees and the respondent is\nseeking injunction, court has not taken into consideration\nthe fact that the appellant has reaffirmed the obligation\ntowards the allottees members and when the allottees /\nmembers pay balance of consideration to the appellant,\nallotment dastavej will be executed in their favour and\nrestrain order would cause hardship to the appellant herein\nin not conveying the allotment dastavej, it will result into\nmultiplicity of proceedings to be faced by the appellant\nherein and same would hardship to the appellant herein.\nEven for the sake of argument, if the prima facie\nobservations of the learned trial court is believed that the\nrespondent is having a prima facie case, but the trial court\nhas erred in erroneous observation regarding the\nrespondent having irreparable loss and balance of\nconvenience in favour of the respondent. Based upon the\nfindings in the impugned order, the learned trial court has\ngranted injunction over the entire suit land wherein MOU\nwhich is to be enforced as a recital to the fact that 75% of\n\nPage 71 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nthe land will be of the respondent and 25% would be of\nMr.Ashish Patel. It is also on record that the legal\nproceedings initiated against the appellant wherein deeds\nfor survey nos.227 and 228 were executed and the trial\ncourt's own finding that there exists rights of the members,\nthe finding that no irreparable injury to the appellant and\nbalance of convenience is not in favour of the appellant\nherein, is erroneous.\n\nIn the entirety, this Court is of the opinion that the\nentire facts of the case reveals that it becomes an\nirreversible situation for the appellant to reverse and to\ncancel the allotment of the members by compensating the\nrights and take back possession of the plots. In fact, it will\nbe a irreparable injury to the members / allottees and rights\nwhich are not being brought on record by the respondent,\nwho admitted them to be brought on record in the rejoinder\nand this fact also cannot be denied that the allottees are\nmore in number and who are bonafide purchasers of the\nland, rightly or wrongly which is yet to be decided and they\nwill initiate litigation against the appellant herein and the\nappellant will face hardship. Whereas, on the other hand,\nthe respondents, who are concerned with their business of\npurchasing, selling and developing the land activities, can\nbe adequately compensated in terms of money. As such, all\nthe three principles of injunction are not proved. In entirety\nprima facie case does not help the plaintiff to get the order\nof injunction but at the same time, the plaintiff should also\n\nPage 72 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nshow balance of convenience and irreparable loss is in his\nfavour and unless and until all the three ingredients\nnamely prima facie case, balance of convenience and\nirreparable loss, are tilted in favour of the plaintiff, the\nCourt should be slow in granting injunction. Here also,\nprima facie case of the plaintiff depends upon the agreement\nto sell and MOU and both the documents are contradictory\nand are disputed. At the same time, as stated hereinabove,\nbalance of convenience and irreparable loss is in favour of\nthe defendant rather than the plaintiff. Under the\ncircumstances, the impugned order is not just, legal and the\nfindings are not on the basis of the facts and evidence on\nrecord and hence the impugned order cannot sustain in the\neye of law.\n\n12. In the result, present Appeal From Order is allowed.\nThe impugned injunction order passed by the learned\nPrincipal Senior Civil Judge, Sanand below Ex.5 in Special\nCivil Suit No.407 of 2017 (Old Special Civil Suit No.272 of\n2013) dated 30/11/2022 is hereby quashed and set aside.\n\nConsidering the nature of the dispute between the\nparties, the learned trial court is hereby directed to expedite\nthe hearing of the suit and decide and dispose of the suit, in\naccordance with law, subject to result of the SLP(C) No.\n20976 of 2022, pending before Hon'ble the Apex Court,\nwithin a period of four months from the date of receipt of\nthis order.\n\nPage 73 of 74\n\nDownloaded on : Tue Jun 20 20:47:43 IST 2023\n\nC/AO/203/2022 CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 20/06/2023\n\nParties are directed to co-operate the learned trial\ncourt in early disposal of the suit, as aforesaid\nNo costs.\n\nIn view of disposal of the main Appeal From Order,\nCivil Application No.1 of 2022 and Civil Application No.1 of\n2023, do not survive and they stand disposed of\naccordingly.\n\nIn the facts and circumstances of the case, there shall\nbe no order as to costs.\n\nSd/-\n\n(RAJENDRA M. SAREEN,J)\n\nAfter pronouncement of the judgement and order, the\nMr.Jigar Raval, learned advocate for the respondent submits\nthat so as to approach the learned Apex Court, the execution,\noperation and implementation of the present judgement and\norder may be stayed for a period of eight weeks.\n\nMr.Raju, learned advocate appearing for the appellant\nobjected the request of stay of the order made by the learned\nadvocate for the respondent. He has submitted that the\nappellant has faced a great hardship and inconvenience till today\nand if the order is stayed, the appellant will face more hardship.\n\nHere in this case, right from the order passed below Exh.5,\nthe status quo is directed to be maintained by the trial court\nwhich is continued till today. Therefore, to enable the respondent\nto challenge the present judgement and order before the Hon'ble\nApex Court, the execution, operation and implementation of the\nabove impugned judgement and order pronounced today is\nhereby stayed for a period of six weeks from today.\n\nSd/-\n\n(RAJENDRA M.
