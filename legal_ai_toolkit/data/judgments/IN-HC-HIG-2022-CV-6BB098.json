And Another on 30 December, 2022\n\nAuthor:\nJyotsna Rewal Dua\n\nBench:\nJyotsna Rewal Dua\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, SHIMLA\n\nCWPOA No. 7531 of 2019\nReserved on : 23.12.2022\n\n.\n\nDate of decision: 30.12.2022\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMadan Lal and others Petitioners\n\nVersus\n\nState of H.P. and another Respondents\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoram :-\n\nMs. Jyotsna Rewal Dua, Judge\n\nWhether approved for reporting? 1 Yes\n____________________________________________________\n\nFor the Petitioners : Mr. Bhuvnesh Sharma, Senior Advocate, with\n\nMr. Parav Sharma, Advocate\n\nFor the Respondent : Ms. Ritta Goswami, Additional Advocate General,\nwith Mr. Ram Lal Thakur, Assistant Advocate\nGeneral\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJyotsna Rewal Dua, Judge\n\nIn LHLJ 2009 (2) 887 (\nParas Ram Vs. State of Himachal\n\nPradesh and another\n), it was held that ad-hoc service followed\n\nwithout break by immediate regularization is to be counted towards\n\nannual increments. While arriving at this decision, the Court noted\n\nOffice Letter dated 27.09.1977 which reads as under :-\n\n\"I am directed to refer to your letter No. EDN-H(2) B (2) 6/88-III dated the\nth\n12 September, 1977, on the above subject and to say that where there is a\nbreak in Ad-Hoc service and regular appointment, the period of Ad-Hoc\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nservice will not count towards increment, but where the ad-Hoc appointment\nin following by immediately regular appointment and there is no break in\nservice, the AD-Hoc service will be counted towards increment in the normal\ncourse.\"\n\n.\n\nThe above decision was followed by the Division Bench of this\n\nCourt in its judgment dated 15.07.2010 rendered in LPA No. 36 of\n\n2010 (\nSita Ram Vs. State of H.P\n.) wherein benefit of ad-hoc service in\n\naddition to grant of increments was also allowed for the purpose of\n\npension. Relevant extract from the judgment reads thus :-\n\n\"....However, this court in\nParas Ram\n's case had laid down the law that if ad\nhoc service is followed by regular service in the same post, the said service\ncould be counted for the purpose of increments. It is also settled principle of\n\nlaw that any service that is counted for the purpose of increment, will count\n\nfor pension also. To that extent the appellant is justified in making\nsubmission that period may be treated as qualifying service for the purpose\nof pension also. However, so far as the seniority is concerned, the basic\nnorms of seniority will be counted on the date of appointment in regular\n\nservice, qua those who are already in regular service as on that date. If the\nclaim of the petitioner-appellant is to be accepted, it will unsettle the settled\n\nseniority of those regular teachers. It may also not be out of context to note\nthat none of the affected teachers is before us. Be that, as it may. Since the\n\npetitioner-appellant under law is entitled only for counting the ad hoc service,\nfollowed by regular service for the purpose of increments and pension, there\nis no merit in the appeal and the same is dismissed subject to the above\n\nmodification that the period that is counted for the purpose of increment, will\ncount for pension also.\"\n\n2. Relying upon the above decisions, petitioners have raised\n\nfurther contention in the instant writ petition that (i) increments given\n\nfor such ad-hoc service should also be counted towards bunching\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nbenefits and (ii) to count ad-hoc service for grant of Assured Career\n\nProgression (ACP). The substantive reliefs prayed for by the\n\npetitioners are as follows :-\n\n.\n\n\"i) That the impugned rejection dated 19.10.2015, Annexure A-3,\nmay kindly be quashed and set aside and the applicants may\nkindly be held entitled for the benefit of their ad-hoc service\n\ntowards seniority, promotion, ACP, bunching and stagnation\nScale w.e.f. due date with all consequential benefits.\n\nii) That the arrears accrued to the applicants on account of\n\nbunching, ACP and stagnation scale after revision of pay, may\nkindly be ordered to be paid with interest.\"\n\nRespondent No. 2 has rejected petitioners' representation\n\nseeking bunching of increments and grant of ACP for the ad-hoc\n\nservice vide order dated 19.10.2015 (Annexure A-3)). This order has\n\nalso been assailed in the petition.\n\n3. On completion of 10 years of ad-hoc service, the petitioners'\n\nservices were regularized by the respondents by awarding them\n\nspecial JBT certificates. In terms of the judgments passed in Paras\n\nRam and Sita Ram's cases (supra), the benefit of ad-hoc service has\n\nbeen granted to the petitioners for the purpose of releasing them\n\nannual increments. It is also not in dispute that the ad-hoc service\n\nrendered by the petitioners is also to be counted towards due and\n\nadmissible pension to the petitioners. In view of law\nlaid down in\n\naforesaid decisions, ad-hoc service cannot be counted towards\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nseniority [Re: (2021) 12 Scale 159 Malook Singh and others Vs.\n\nState of Punjab and others] wherein it was held that initial stop gap\n\narrangement being not in accordance with the rules and the ad-hoc\n\n.\n\nservice cannot be counted for the purpose of seniority.\n\n4. The questions for consideration propounded in the instant\n\npetition are:-\n\n(i) Whether the increments granted to the petitioners for the\n\nperiod of ad-hoc service rendered by them (in terms of decisions\n\nrendered in Paras Ram & Sita Ram's cases supra), can also be\n\nconsidered for grant of bunching benefits or not ?\n\n(ii) Whether the ad-hoc service can be considered for grant of\n\nAssured Career Progression ?\n\n5. I have heard learned counsel on both sides on the questions\n\ninvolved in the instant petition. In my considered view the increments\n\nearned by the petitioners during the period of ad-hoc serevice in terms\n\nof decisions in Paras Ram & Sita Ram's cases supra, are liable to be\n\nconsidered for the grant of bunching benefits. However, ad-hoc\n\nservice is not liable to be counted for grant of ACP. The reasons for\n\nholding so are as under :-\n\nQuestion No. 1\n\n5 (i) Bunching occurs in fixation of pay when pay at two or more\n\nconsecutive stages in a pay scale/grade pay in the pre-revised scale\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\ngets fixed at the same stage in the corresponding pay scale/level in\n\nthe revised pay structure. In other words, bunching occurs when two\n\nor more stages gets bunched and benefit of one increment is to be\n\n.\n\ngiven for every two or more stages bunched.\n\n5 (ii) The Himachal Pradesh Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules,\n\n1998 came into force from 01.01.1996. Rule 7 of these rules provided\n\nfixation of pay in the revised scale. The proviso to the rule provided for\n\nbunching of stages in the existing scale. The relevant part of this rule\n\nis extracted hereinafter :-\n\n\"7. Fixation of Pay in the Revised Scale.- The pay of a Government\n\nemployee who opts or is deemed to have opted for the revised scale in terms\n\nof the provisions of these rules shall, unless in any case the Government by\nspecial order otherwise directs, be fixed in the following manner, namely:-\n\n(j) an amount representing forty percent of the basic pay in the existing scale\n\nshall be added to the \"Existing Emoluments\" of the employee; and\n\n(ii) after the existing emoluments have been so increased, the pay shall\nthereafter be fixed in the revised scale at the stage next above the amount of\n\nthe existing emoluments so computed, if it falls between two stages and it the\namount so computed is equal to a stage in the revised scale, then the pay\n\nshall be fixed at such equal stage;\n\nProvided that:-\n\n(a) if the minimum of the revised scale is more than the amount so\narrived at, the pay shall be fixed at the minimum of the revised scale;\n\n(b) If the amount so arrived at is higher than the maximum of the\nrevised scale, the amount in excess of the maximum of the revised\nscale shall be treated as personal pay which shall be absorbed in future\nincrements and shall be reckoned as pay for all purposes;\n\nProvided further that where in the fixation of pay, the pay of Government\nemployees drawing pay at more than three consecutive stages in an existing\nscale gets bunched, that is to say, gets fixed in the revised scale at the same\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nstage, the pay in the revised scale of such of those government employees\nwho are drawing pay beyond the first three consecutive stages in the existing\nscale shall be stepped up by grant of increment (s) in the revised scale in the\nfollowing manner, namely :-\n\n.\n\n(a) for the Government employees drawing pay from the fourth upto\n\nthe sixth stage in the existing scale- by one increment;\n\n(b) for the Government employees drawing pay from the seventh\nupto the ninth stage in the existing scale, if there is bunching beyond\n\nthe sixth stage- by two increments;\n\n(c) For the Government employee drawing pay from the tenth upto\nthe twelfth stage in the existing scale if there is bunching beyond the\nninth stage- by three increments;\n\n(d) For the Government employees drawing pay from the thirteenth\nupto the fifteenth stage in the existing scale, if there is bunching\nbeyond the twelfth stage- by four increments;\n\nIf by stepping up the pay as above, the pay of a Government\n\nemployee gets fixed up at a stage in the revised scale which is higher than\nthe stage at which the pay of a government employee who was drawing more\npay in the same existing scale is fixed, the pay of the latter shall also be\n\nstepped up to the level at par with the former;\n\nProvided further that the fixation thus made shall ensure that every\nGovernment employee shall get at least one increment in the revised scale\n\nfor every three increments (inclusive of ex-gratia increment (s), if any) in the\nexisting scale; NOTE:- See Illustrations 1 to 7 appended to these rules for\n\nguidance..........\".\n\nOn 07.11.1998, State Finance Department issued\n\nclarifications (Annexure MA-1) concerning Himachal Pradesh Civil\n\nServices (Revised Pay) Rules, 1998. Some of the relevant\n\nclarifications pertaining to bunching of increments read as under :-\n\n\" .....3. As per second proviso below Benefit of bunching and stepping up of\nrule 7 of the Revised Pay Rules, ibid, pay in such cases is to be allowed after\nwherein the fixation of pay, the pay of identifying the particular\nGovernment employee, drawing pay at officers/officials in the cadre.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nmore than 3 consecutive stages in the\nexisting scale gets bunched i.e. to say\ngets fixed I the revised scale at the\nsame stage, the pay in the revised\nscale of such of the employees, who\nare drawing pay beyond the first three\n\n.\n\nconsecutive stages and so on in the\nexisting scale, shall be stepped up by\n\ngrant of increments according to\nnumber of stages.\n\nIt may be elucidated whether the\n\nbenefit of bunching in such cases has\nto be allowed after identifying the\nparticular officers or on presumptive\nbasis, with reference to stages\nbunched.\n\n4. An officer exercises option for As is clear in Second Proviso under\nfixation of pay in the revised scales Rule 7 bunching is to be done by\nw.e.f. 1.1.96 without getting annual counting increments in the existing\nincrement due on 1.1.1996 in existing scale only.

This letter was strongly\n\npressed into service by the learned Additional Advocate General\n\nwhile opposing the writ petition.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\n5 (iv) It is beyond comprehension that when ad-hoc service\n\n(rendered in the manner prescribed in Paras Ram & Sita Ram's\n\ncases supra) is to be counted for grant of pension and increments,\n\n.\n\nthen why it is to be denied for the purpose of bunching of\n\nincrements. The increments already earned by an employee are to\n\nbe taken into consideration for grant of bunching benefit for fixation\n\nof his pay in the revised scale. Grant of increments and bunching of\n\nsuch increments is not dependent upon nature of service, be it ad-\n\nhoc or regular. It is the pleaded case of respondents in the reply that\n\n\"in the bunching provisions of pay revision Rules, only the term\n\n\"stages\" or increment earned\" on the post in previous scale is\n\nmentioned and it is nowhere mentioned that the service should be\n\non regular or ad-hoc basis.\" Bunching of increments is purely\n\ndependent upon number of increments earned by the employee in\n\nthe existing scale. It is an admitted fact that in accordance with\n\ndecisions rendered in Paras Ram & Sita Ram's cases supra, the\n\npetitioners have earned and have been granted increments for the\n\nad-hoc service rendered by them immediately before their\n\nregularization. Having earned increments for the ad-hoc service, the\n\npetitioners are certainly entitled for bunching benefit of counting\n\nthese increments for fixation of their pay in the revised pay scale.\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nQuestion No. 2\n\n5 (v) The next relief prayed for by the petitioners is for\n\ncounting the ad-hoc service rendered by them for the purpose of\n\n.\n\nallowing Assured Career Progression (ACP). No basis for claiming\n\nthis relief has been put forth. The only argument raised is that this\n\nbenefit was granted by the respondents to a couple of employees,\n\nhence, on the same analogy, the benefit of ACP by counting the ad-\n\nhoc service should also be allowed to the petitioners. The\n\nrespondents have pleaded that the benefit of ACP was wrongly\n\npassed on to a couple of employees, however, the mistake has\n\nsince long been rectified and the benefit of ACP erroneously\n\nreleased in favour of some of the employees now stands adjusted. It\n\nis well settled that negative parity cannot be claimed. Ground of\n\ndiscrimination cannot be urged citing wrong orders passed in favour\n\nof others. No other reason has been put forth by the petitioners for\n\nreleasing them the benefit of ACP. Assured Career Progression\n\n(ACP) Scheme has not been placed on record. Benefit of ACP is\n\nusually allowed to those regular government servants who do not\n\nhave promotion avenues and stagnate for long time on the post held\n\nby them. The objective of an Assured Career Progression Scheme is\n\nto ensure financial upgradation, enhancements/promotions to a\n\nregular employee in his entire service career. Petitioners have\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS\nneither placed on record the Assured Career Progression Scheme\n\nnor any of its clauses are under challenge. By nature of applicability\n\nand the object of ACP, it cannot be granted for the ad-hoc service\n\n.\n\nrendered by the petitioners.\n\nNo other point was urged.\n\n5. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the\n\nincrements earned by the petitioners for the duration of their ad-hoc\n\nservice in terms of decisions rendered in Paras Ram & Sita Ram's\n\ncases (supra) are liable to be bunched for the purpose of fixation of\n\ntheir pay in the revised pay scale. The respondents are directed to\n\ngrant the benefit of bunching of increments earned by the petitioners\n\nduring ad-hoc service and fix their pay accordingly within a period of\n\nsix weeks from today. The relief of counting their ad-hoc service\n\ntowards grant of ACP claimed by the petitioners is declined.\n\nThe writ petition stands disposed of in the aforesaid\n\nterms alongwith the pending applications, if any.\n\n30th December, 2022 (K) ( Jyotsna Rewal Dua ),\nJudge\n\n::: Downloaded on - 30/12/2022 20:34:02 :::CIS",
