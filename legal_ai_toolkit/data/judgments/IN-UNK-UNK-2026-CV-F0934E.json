Learned advocate for the applicant submitted that\n the so-called incident has occurred in the evening\n\n Page 1 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n of 30.11.2022, for which, FIR has been lodged on\n the very same day i.e. on 30.11.2022 and in\n connection with the same, the applicant has been\n arrested on 11.01.2023 and since then, he is in\n judicial custody. Learned advocate submitted that\n the applicant is not named in the FIR and only on\n the basis of the statement of the co-accused, the\n applicant is arraigned as accused. Learned\n advocate submitted that the applicant was not\n found in conscious possession of the prohibited\n contraband articles and there is no recovery or\n discovery at the instance of the present applicant\n\n - accused.\n\n 4. Learned advocate, at this stage, submitted that\n this is a successive bail application preferred by\n the application after the rejection of earlier\n bail application being Criminal Misc. Application\n No.18701/2023 vide order dated 04.12.2023, however\n while rejecting said application, the aspect of\n non-compliance of the mandatory provision of\n \nSection 52A\n of the NDPS has not been considered\n and wrongly rejected the said application because\n the communication in that regard, which had been\n undertaken by the IO for complying with the said\n provision, is not part and parcel of the\n chargesheet papers. It is, therefore, submitted\n that only on that count, the bail application of\n the applicant may be considered and the applicant\n may be granted bail. Learned advocate further\n submitted that the applicant is in jail since\n\n Page 2 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n 11.01.2023 and thus, more than 12 months are over\n and, therefore, the applicant may not be kept\n behind the bar for indefinite period. He further\n submitted that even in recent past, the Hon'ble\n Supreme Court has also issued guidelines in case\n of delay in trial and the fact that \"bail is a\n rule\" and \"jail is an exception\". It is,\n therefore, urged that the present application may\n be allowed.\n\n 5. On the other hand, learned APP, Mr. Joshi for the\n respondent-State has opposed grant of regular bail\n looking to the nature and gravity of the offence.\n He submitted that in fact, at the time of hearing\n of earlier bail application, all the aspects\n raised by learned advocate for the applicant have\n been considered and as stated above, this is a\n successive bail application preferred by the\n applicant but there is no changed circumstances\n for filing such application. He further submitted\n that in fact, the aspect of non-compliance of the\n provision of \nSection 52A\n of the NDPS has been\n considered by the Coordinate Bench of this Court\n while passing an order dated 21.08.2024 in\n Criminal Misc. Application No.19761/2023 in case\n of co-accused and the Coordinate Bench of this\n Court has rejected the said application\n considering the said fact, therefore, reliance\n placed by learned advocate for the applicant on\n that aspect cannot be considered at this stage.\n\n 6. Learned APP submitted that the present application\n\n Page 3 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n is a successive bail application after the\n rejection of earlier bail application, however,\n the present application is preferred without\n disclosing any changed circumstance except abvoe\n and, hence, this application can be said to be\n 'review application' and power of review\n application is very limited and when there is\n technical and/or arithmetical error, review\n application can be preferred, which can be\n entertained but in the present case, the applicant\n has failed to show any changed circumstance and\n the reasons, which are mentioned in the memo of\n application, were at all available at the earlier\n point of time when earlier bail application was\n rejected.\n\n 7. I have heard the learned advocates appearing on\n behalf of the respective parties and perused the\n papers of the investigation and considered the\n allegations levelled against the applicant and the\n role played by the applicant. I have also\n considered the reasoning given by the concerned\n court while rejecting the bail application and the\n affidavit filed by the IO opposing the said\n application.\n\n 8. It is the settled position of the law that, at\n this juncture detailed discussion of evidence and\n canvassing of the allegations contained in FIR as\n well as affidavit of the concerned Investigating\n Officer or the merits of the case as well, is not\n necessary and should be avoided.\n\n Page 4 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n \n9. It is a well settled principle of law that when\n the successive application comes before the Court,\n the Court would be very conscious while\n considering the same. It is also a settled\n position of law that successive bail applications\n are permissible under the change circumstances and\n the change circumstances must be substantial one\n which has direct impact on the earlier decision\n and not merely a cosmetic changes which are of\n little or no consequences. As held by the Apex\n Court in \nState of Maharashtra Vs. Captain\n Buddhikota Subha Rao\n, reported in AIR 1989 SC\n 2292, that successive bail application can be\n entertained by the Court when substantial change\n is established by the accused, which would entitle\n him for getting bail in successive bail\n application. The Court should not pass the order\n of releasing him on bail in successive bail\n application merely establishing some cosmetic\n change between time gap of two applications. There\n should be drastic change during the period between\n two applications, which would entitle the accused\n for bail.\n The Apex Court in the case of\n Kalyanchandra Sarkar Vs. Rajesh Ranjan, reported\n in (2005) 2 SCC 42 while dealing with the issue of\n successive bail application has observed that\n without change in the circumstances, the\n subsequent bail application would be deemed to be\n seeking a review of the earlier rejection order\n which is not permissible under the criminal law.\n\n Page 5 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n The Apex Court has further observed that while\n entertaining such undefined consequent bail\n application, the Court has a duty to consider the\n reasons and grounds on which the earlier bail\n application was rejected and what are the fresh\n grounds which persuade it warranting the\n evaluation and consideration of the bail\n application afresh and to take a view different\n from one taken in the earlier application.\n\n 10. It is found out from the arguments canvassed by\n learned advocate for the applicant that main\n argument of learned advocate for the applicant is\n with regard to non-fulfillment of the required\n procedure as envisaged under \nSection 52A\n of the\n NDPS Act and on the strength of the said argument,\n bail is sought for. It is, however, required to be\n noted that as can be found from the submissions\n canvassed by learned APP that in case of co-\n accused, who had filed Criminal Misc. Application\n No.19761/2023, the Coordinate Bench of this Court,\n after considering the submissions and considering\n the said aspect, has rejected the said application\n by detailed order. It is submitted that it is\n specifically observed in the said order that the\n procedure under \nSection 52A\n of the NDPS has been\n carried out by the Investigating Agency belatedly\n but the said aspect is a matter or proof and would\n required consideration at the time of trial. Thus\n the said view adopted by the Coordinate Bench of\n this Court can be said to be just, legal and\n\n Page 6 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\n undefined\n\n proper, which in my considered opinion, applies in\n the facts of the present case. Over and above,\n learned advocate has failed to point out any\n changed circumstances. Therefore in absence of any\n changed circumstances, once again present\n application is preferred agitating same grounds,\n which in the opinion of this Court, is not\n available to the applicant in a successive bail\n application.\n\n 11. Over and above that, strong apprehension has been\n shown by prosecution that if the applicant is\n released on bail then, there is possibility of\n tampering with the evidence and fleeing away from\n the trial. Therefore considering the nature of\n offence, role attributed to the applicant and\n played by him, I am of the opinion that the\n present application deserves to be rejected.\n\n 12. In view of the facts and circumstances of the\n present case, this Court is of the view that after\n the rejection of earlier regular bail application,\n there is no change in the circumstances.\n Accordingly, the present application is rejected.\n\n 13. Needless to say that any expression of opinion\n given in this order does not mean an expression of\n opinion on the merits of the case and the trial\n Court will not be influenced by any observations\n made therein.\n\n (DIVYESH A.
