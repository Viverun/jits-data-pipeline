Appellant(s)\n\n Versus\n\n The State by Inspector of Police .... Respondent(s)\n\n WITH\n\n CRIMINAL APPEAL NOs. 1135-1136 OF 2013\n CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1137 OF 2013\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n R.K. Agrawal, J.\n\n 1) The above appeals are directed against the common\n\n judgment and order dated 23.11.2009 passed by the High\n\n Court of Judicature at Madras in Criminal Appeal Nos. 639\n\n and 688 of 2009 whereby the Division Bench of the High Court\n\n dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants herein against\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nASHA SUNDRIYAL\n\nDate: 2018.04.16\n\n the order dated 18.09.2009 passed by the Fast Track Court\n\nDigitally signed by\n\n16:14:10 IST\nReason:\n\n No. II, Salem, in Sessions Case No. 21 of 2009 wherein learned\n\n 1\n\n\fAdditional District & Sessions Judge convicted the appellants\n\nherein under Sections 302 read with Section 34, Section 364\n\nand \nSection 379\n of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short ‘the\n\nIPC\n’) and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life with\n\nsubstantive sentences under the \nIPC\n.\n\n2) Brief facts:\n\n(a) A First Information Report (FIR) bearing No. 41 of 2008 at\n\nPS Yercaud, District Salem dated 16.02.2008 got registered by\n\nMahimaidoss (PW-8) stating that on 14.02.2008, John Bosco\n\n(since deceased), who was employed as the driver in his travel\n\nagency, along with one Madhan (since deceased), took a\n\nMaruti Van from him but did not return for two days.\n\n(b) On the very next date, i.e., on 17.02.2008, one more FIR\n\ngot registered by one Asokan bearing No. 88 of 2008 stating\n\nthat when he went to irrigate his fields, he found a white\n\ncolour sack floating in the well. He immediately informed the\n\nsame to the local police and when the sack was opened, a\n\nmale body with hands tied at the back was found.\n\n(c) On the basis of FIR dated 16.02.2008, Crime No. 41 of\n\n2008 was registered at Yercaud Police Station and during the\n\n 2\n\n\fpendency of investigation, FIR No. 88 of 2008 got registered\n\nand a body was found which was identified as of John Bosco.\n\n(d) During investigation, Sivashankar (A-1 therein) was\n\napprehended and he confessed about committing the crime\n\nalong with (A-2 and A-3) appellants herein stating that they\n\nabducted John Bosco and his friend Madhan and taken them\n\nin the Maruti Van being driven by John Bosco to one of the\n\nrelatives of Accused No. 2 therein where they caused death of\n\nJohn Bosco and Madhan by strangulating them one by one\n\nusing a rope and drowned their bodies in water streams using\n\ngunny bags. A-1 also took the investigation officer to the place\n\nwhere the body of Madhan was found in a gunny bag.\n\n(e) After following the due procedure, a charge sheet was\n\nfiled in the Court of Judicial Magistrate No. 5, Salem and the\n\ncase was committed to the Court of Additional District &\n\nSessions Judge, Fast Track Court No. II, Salem and numbered\n\nas Sessions Case No. 21 of 2009. The Court framed charges\n\nunder \nSections 364\n, \n302\n read with \nSection 34\n, \n201\n read with\n\nSection 302\n and \n379\n of the IPC.\n\n 3\n\n\f(f) Learned Additional District & Sessions Judge, vide\n\njudgment and order dated 18.09.2009, convicted all the\n\naccused for the commission of crime under the charging\n\nSections and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life.\n\n(g) Being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated\n\n18.09.2009, the appellants-accused preferred Criminal Appeal\n\nNos. 639 and 688 of 2009 before the High Court. The Division\n\nBench of the High Court, vide judgment and order dated\n\n23.11.2009, dismissed the appeals preferred by the appellants\n\nherein.\n\n(h) Being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated\n\n23.11.2009, the appellants herein have preferred these\n\nappeals by way of special leave before this Court.\n\n3) Heard Mr. K.K. Mani, learned counsel for the\n\nappellants-accused and Mr. M. Yogesh Kanna, learned counsel\n\nfor the respondent-State and perused the records.\n\nPoint(s) for consideration:-\n\n4) The only point for consideration before this Court in the\n\npresent facts and circumstances of the case is whether the\n\n 4\n\n\fHigh Court was right in dismissing the appeals preferred by\n\nthe appellants-accused?\n\nRival contentions:-\n\n5) Learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended\n\nthat the courts below failed to appreciate that the conviction\n\ncannot be based upon a retracted confession and it can be\n\nused only in support of other evidence. He further contended\n\nthat the courts below erred in convicting the appellants where\n\nthe cause of death is not known.\n\n6) Learned counsel further contended that there are several\n\nlacunas in the prosecution version. In support of the same, he\n\ncontended that the lower courts failed to appreciate that the\n\nowner of the phone recovered from Accused No. 1 therein is\n\nnot PW-8 and some other person and the said person was\n\nnever examined by the prosecution. Further, on 14.02.2008,\n\nat about 10.30 a.m., PW-11 has seen the accused along with\n\nthe deceased whereas the dead bodies have been found after a\n\ngap of several days and the possibility of intervention of some\n\nother person cannot be ignored.\n\n 5\n\n\f7) Learned counsel appearing for the appellants finally\n\ncontended that the High Court ought to have appreciated the\n\nfact that there was no complete chain of circumstantial\n\nevidence in the prosecution case and there are various\n\ndiscrepancies inherent in it, hence, the benefit of doubt should\n\nbe given in favour of the appellants while setting aside the\n\njudgment and order passed by the High Court.\n\n8) Per contra, learned counsel appearing on the behalf of\n\nRespondent-State submitted that the judgment and order\n\npassed by the Division Bench of the High Court upholding the\n\ndecision of the Sessions Court is as per the terms and dictates\n\nof law and should not be inferred with and the evidence\n\nagainst the appellants-accused are sufficient enough to bring\n\nhome the guilt.\n\nDiscussion:-\n\n9) It is the case of the prosecution that the\n\nappellants-accused planned to earn quick money by robbing a\n\ncar and selling the same and for that purpose on 14.2.2008\n\nthey went to Yercaud and engaged the taxi of the John Bosco\n\n(since deceased) under the guise of sightseeing. John Bosco\n\n 6\n\n\f(since deceased) also took one Madhan (since deceased) on the\n\nway. The appellants-accused asked the driver-John Bosco to\n\ndrop them at Periyar Nagar, Salem at the house of the\n\ngrandfather of one of the accused. After reaching there, the\n\nappellant-accused found that the grandfather was not\n\navailable. The appellants-accused invited John Bosco into the\n\nhouse for taking liquor and they killed both of them by\n\nstrangulating their necks with a rope. Accused No. 1 therein\n\ntook the mobile phone and the Accused No. 3 therein took the\n\nYashika Camera of one John Bosco. Accused No. 2 therein\n\nconcealed the said van in the house of his grandfather. The\n\nnumber plate of van was changed with a sticker. Thereafter,\n\nthey wrapped the dead bodies into separate gunny bags and\n\nthrew the gunny bag containing the dead body of John Bosco\n\ninto the well of PW-1 and threw away the dead body of\n\nMadhan to some other place.\n\n10) The appellants-accused were charged and prosecuted\n\nunder \nSections 302\n read with 34, 364, 201 read with \nSection\n\n379\n of the IPC. As in the given case no direct evidence of the\n\nincident is available, the prosecution heavily relied upon the\n\n 7\n\n\fcircumstantial evidences. To prove the case, the prosecution\n\nhas examined as much as 27 witnesses and produced different\n\nrelevant documents.\n\n11) In the FIR, bearing No. 41 of 2008, lodged by PW-8, at\n\nYercaud Police Station, he had specifically mentioned that he\n\nbought a mobile phone in the name of some other person and\n\nhanded over the same to John Bosco. PW-8 is the owner of the\n\nvehicle which was being driven by John Bosco at the time of\n\nthe incident, and also happens to be his maternal uncle. He\n\nfurther deposed that John Bosco was working as a driver on\n\nthe said vehicle at that time and on the fateful day i.e., on\n\n14.02.2008, he told him that he is going to drop one of his\n\nfriends at Salem and left the place at about 11:30 and when\n\nhe did not return for two days he filed a missing complaint on\n\n16.02.2008. PW-8 also tried to contact John Bosco over the\n\nmobile phone but it was switched off. Mr. Asaithambi\n\n(PW-26), the investigation officer, stated in his deposition that\n\non 25.02.2008, PW-8 handed over the bill of the said mobile\n\nphone to him. During investigation and while tracing the IMEI\n\nnumber of the mobile phone, it was revealed that the said\n\n 8\n\n\fphone was being used by Accused No. 1-Sivasankaran. On\n\n01.03.2008, Accused No. 1 was apprehended by PW-26 and he\n\nvoluntarily gave a confessional statement which was witnessed\n\nby PW-13. Based on his confessional statement, PW-26 found\n\nthe dead body of Madhan as well as the mobile phone of John\n\nBosco and a rope was also recovered with which they alleged\n\nto have murdered the deceased. The dead body was identified\n\nby his mother and the same was further proved by skull\n\nimposition test. He further informed the whereabouts of other\n\naccused persons on the basis of which they were arrested from\n\nYercaud junction. However, he retracted from the given\n\nstatement in the court.\n\n12) Accused No. 2-Suresh was apprehended by PW-20 at\n\nSalem Railway Station based on the information given by\n\nAccused No. 1 and on the basis of his information, the\n\nrecovery of the alleged Omni Van was affected by PW-26.\n\nFurther, Anbalagan (PW-11), who was a Taxi driver at Yercaud\n\nTaxi stand had deposed that the appellants-accused had\n\nspoken to John Bosco on 14.02.2008 for hiring a taxi for\n\nsightseeing. Thereafter, he noticed that the\n\n 9\n\n\fappellants-accused boarded the vehicle of John Bosco and\n\nMadhan also boarded the same vehicle from a short distance.\n\nIn fact, PW-11 had identified the appellants-accused in the\n\ncourt as the persons who had accompanied John Bosco and\n\nMadhan on 14.02.2008.\n\n13) Accused No.-3-Navaneethakrishnan was apprehended by\n\nPW-20 from Salem Railway Station based on the information\n\ngiven by Accused No. 1. PW-26 deposed that on the basis of\n\nthe confession of Accused No. 3, Yashika Camera was\n\nrecovered. The dead body of John Bosco was recovered from\n\nthe farm of PW-1 on 17.02.2008 on his information and the\n\nsame was identified by the mother and father of the deceased\n\nand was further proved by skull imposition test. But it is also\n\nrelevant to mention here that in the present case, the\n\nprosecution has no direct evidence to offer. The entire case\n\nrests upon the circumstantial evidence as there is no witness\n\ndirectly to speak about the occurrence.\n\n14) In the present case, there is no witness of the occurrence\n\nand it is only based on circumstantial evidence. Before\n\nmoving further, it would be apposite to refer the law regarding\n\n 10\n\n\freliability of circumstantial evidence to acquit or convict an\n\naccused. The law regarding circumstantial evidence was aptly\n\ndealt with by this Court in \nPadala Veera Reddy vs. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh and Others\n 1989 Supp. 2 SCC 706 wherein\n\nthis Court has observed as under:-\n\n “10. x x x x\n (1) The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought\n to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly established;\n (2) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency\n unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused;\n (3) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a chain\n so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that\n within all human probability the crime was committed by the\n accused and none else; and\n (4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction\n must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other\n hypothesis than that of guilt of the accused and such evidence\n should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but\n should be inconsistent with his innocence.”\n\n15) The prosecution placed reliance before the Court mainly\n\non three circumstances, firstly, the last seen theory, secondly,\n\nthe recovery of material objects which belonged to both the\n\ndeceased from the appellants-accused and thirdly, the\n\nidentification of the dead body of Madhan from the river bed as\n\npointed out by the first accused, however, the appellant herein\n\nhas raised certain doubts regarding the same.\n\n 11\n\n\f16) The pivotal evidence in the given case is the testimony of\n\nPW-11 who is believed to have lastly seen the\n\nappellants-accused with the deceased. Learned counsel\n\nappearing for the appellants-accused has contended that all\n\nthe accused were unknown to PW-11 but no identification\n\nparade was conducted and the said witness has identified the\n\nsaid accused directly in court after a lapse of about 50 days’\n\nand hence his evidence should not be relied upon.\n\n17) It is a settled proposition of law that the identification\n\nparade of the accused before the court of law is not the only\n\nmain and substantive piece of evidence, but it is only a\n\ncorroborative piece of evidence. Regarding this, reliance can\n\nbe safely placed on \nRafikul Alam & Others vs. The State of\n\nWest Bengal\n 2008 Crl. L.J. 2005 wherein it was held as\n\nunder:-\n\n “32…..It is accordingly considered a safe rule of prudence to\n generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of\n witnesses in Court as to the identity of the accused who are\n strangers to them, in the form of earlier identification proceedings.\n This rule of prudence, however, is subject to exceptions when, for\n example, the Court is impressed by a particular witness on whose\n testimony it can safely rely, without such or other corroboration.\n The identification parades do not constitute substantive evidence.\n Failure to hold a test identification parade would not make\n inadmissible the evidence of identification in Court. The weight to\n\n 12\n\n\f be attached to such identification should be a matter for the\n Courts of fact. In appropriate cases it may accept the evidence of\n identification even without insisting upon corroboration”\n\n18) PW-11 was able to identify all the three accused in the\n\nCourt itself by recapitulating his memory as those persons\n\nwho came at the time when he was washing his car along with\n\nJohn Bosco and further that he had last seen all of them\n\nsitting in the Omni van on that day and his testimony to that\n\neffect remains intact even during the cross examination in the\n\nlight of the fact that the said witness has no enmity\n\nwhatsoever against the appellants herein and he is an\n\nindependent witness. Once the testimony of PW-11 is\n\nestablished and inspires full confidence, it is well established\n\nthat it is the accused who were last seen with the deceased\n\nspecially in the circumstances when there is nothing on record\n\nto show that they parted from the accused and since then no\n\nactivity of the deceased can be traced and their dead bodies\n\nwere recovered later on. It is a settled legal position that the\n\nlaw presumes that it is the person, who was last seen with the\n\ndeceased, would have killed the deceased and the burden to\n\n 13\n\n\frebut the same lies on the accused to prove that they had\n\ndeparted. Undoubtedly, the last seen theory is an important\n\nevent in the chain of circumstances that would completely\n\nestablish and/or could point to the guilt of the accused with\n\nsome certainty. However, this evidence alone can’t discharge\n\nthe burden of establishing the guilt of accused beyond\n\nreasonable doubt and requires corroboration.\n\n19) Learned counsel for the appellants-accused contended\n\nthat the statements given by the appellants-accused are\n\nprevious statements made before the police and cannot be\n\ntherefore relied upon by both the appellant-accused as well as\n\nthe prosecution. \nIn this view of the matter, it is pertinent to\n\nmention here the following decision of this Court in \nSelvi and\n\nOthers vs. State of Karnataka\n (2010) 7 SCC 263 wherein it\n\nwas held as under:-\n\n “133. We have already referred to the language of \nSection\n 161\n CrPC which protects the accused as well as suspects\n and witnesses who are examined during the course of\n investigation in a criminal case. It would also be useful to\n refer to \nSections 162\n, \n163\n and \n164\n CrPC which lay down\n procedural safeguards in respect of statements made by\n persons during the course of investigation. However, \nSection\n 27\n of the Evidence Act incorporates the “theory of\n confirmation by subsequent facts” i.e. statements made in\n custody are admissible to the extent that they can be proved\n\n 14\n\n\f by the subsequent discovery of facts. It is quite possible that\n the content of the custodial statements could directly lead to\n the subsequent discovery of relevant facts rather than their\n discovery through independent means. Hence such\n statements could also be described as those which “furnish a\n link in the chain of evidence” needed for a successful\n prosecution. This provision reads as follows:\n\n “27. How much of information received from accused may\n be proved.—Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as\n discovered in consequence of information received from a\n person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police\n officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts\n to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact\n thereby discovered, may be proved.\n\n 134. This provision permits the derivative use of custodial\n statements in the ordinary course of events. In Indian law, there\n is no automatic presumption that the custodial statements have\n been extracted through compulsion. In short, there is no\n requirement of additional diligence akin to the administration of\n Miranda warnings. However, in circumstances where it is shown\n that a person was indeed compelled to make statements while\n in custody, relying on such testimony as well as its derivative\n use will offend \nArticle 20(3)\n.”\n\n20) In this view, the information given by an accused person\n\nto a police officer leading to the discovery of a fact which may\n\nor may not prove incriminatory has been made admissible\n\nunder \nSection 27\n of the Evidence Act, 1872. Further, in \nSelvi\n\n(supra), this Court held as under:-\n\n “264. In light of these conclusions, we hold that no\n individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the\n techniques in question, whether in the context of\n investigation in criminal cases or otherwise. Doing so would\n amount to an unwarranted intrusion into personal liberty.\n However, we do leave room for the voluntary administration\n of the impugned techniques in the context of criminal justice\n\n 15\n\n\f provided that certain safeguards are in place. Even when the\n subject has given consent to undergo any of these tests, the\n test results by themselves cannot be admitted as evidence\n because the subject does not exercise conscious control over\n the responses during the administration of the test.\n However, any information or material that is subsequently\n discovered with the help of voluntary administered test\n results can be admitted in accordance with \nSection 27\n of the\n Evidence Act, 1872.”\n\n21) In \nMadhu vs. State of Kerala\n (2012) 2 SCC 399, this\n\nCourt while discussing the mandate of \nSection 27\n of the\n\nEvidence Act held as under:-\n\n “49. As an exception, \nSection 27\n of the Evidence Act provides\n that a confessional statement made to a police officer or\n while an accused is in police custody, can be proved against\n him, if the same leads to the discovery of an unknown fact.\n The rationale of \nSections 25\n and \n26\n of the Evidence Act is,\n that police may procure a confession by coercion or threat.\n The exception postulated under \nSection 27\n of the Evidence\n Act is applicable only if the confessional statement leads to\n the discovery of some new fact. The relevance under the\n exception postulated by \nSection 27\n aforesaid, is limited “…\n as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered….”. The\n rationale behind \nSection 27\n of the Evidence Act is, that the\n facts in question would have remained unknown but for the\n disclosure of the same by the accused. The discovery of facts\n itself, therefore, substantiates the truth of the confessional\n statement. And since it is truth that a court must endeavour\n to search, \nSection 27\n aforesaid has been incorporated as an\n exception to the mandate contained in \nSections 25\n and \n26\n of\n the Evidence Act.”\n\n22) \nSection 27\n of the Evidence Act is applicable only if the\n\nconfessional statement leads to the discovery of some new\n\nfact. The relevance is limited as relates distinctly to the fact\n\nthereby discovered. In the case at hand, the Yashika Camera\n\n 16\n\n\fwhich was recovered at the instance of Accused No. 3 was not\n\nidentified by the father as well as the mother of the deceased.\n\nIn fact, the prosecution is unable to prove that the said\n\ncamera actually belongs to the deceased-John Bosco. Though\n\nthe mobile phone is recovered from A-1, but there is no\n\nevidence on record establishing the fact that the cell phone\n\nbelongs to the deceased-John Bosco or to PW-8 as the same\n\nwas not purchased in their name. Further, the prosecution\n\nfailed to examine the person on whose name the cell phone\n\nwas purchased to show that it originally belongs to PW-8 to\n\nprove the theory of PW-8 that he had purchased and given it\n\nto the deceased John-Bosco. Further, the material objects,\n\nviz., Nokia phone and Motor Bike do not have any bearing on\n\nthe case itself. The Nokia phone was recovered from Accused\n\nNo. 1 and it is not the case that it was used for the\n\ncommission of crime and similarly the motor cycle so\n\nrecovered was of the father of Accused No. 3 and no evidence\n\nhas been adduced or produced by the prosecution as to how\n\nthese objects have a bearing on the case. In fact, none of the\n\nwitnesses have identified the camera or stated the belongings\n\n 17\n\n\fof John Bosco. The said statements are inadmissible in spite\n\nof the mandate contained in \nSection 27\n for the simple reason\n\nthat it cannot be stated to have resulted in the discovery of\n\nsome new fact. The material objects which the police is\n\nclaimed to have recovered from the accused may well have\n\nbeen planted by the police. Hence, in the absence of any\n\nconnecting link between the crime and the things recovered,\n\nthere recovery on the behest of accused will not have any\n\nmaterial bearing on the facts of the case.\n\n23) The law is well settled that each and every incriminating\n\ncircumstance must be clearly established by reliable and\n\nclinching evidence and the circumstances so proved must\n\nform a chain of events from which the only irresistible\n\nconclusion about the guilt of the accused can be safely drawn\n\nand no other hypothesis against the guilt is possible. In a\n\ncase depending largely upon circumstantial evidence, there is\n\nalways a danger that conjecture or suspicion may take the\n\nplace of legal proof. The court must satisfy itself that various\n\ncircumstances in the chain of events must be such as to rule\n\nout a reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the accused.\n\n 18\n\n\fWhen the important link goes, the chain of circumstances gets\n\nsnapped and the other circumstances cannot, in any manner,\n\nestablish the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\nThe court has to be watchful and avoid the danger of allowing\n\nthe suspicion to take the place of legal proof for sometimes,\n\nunconsciously it may happen to be a short step between moral\n\ncertainty and legal proof. There is a long mental distance\n\nbetween “may be true” and “must be true” and the same\n\ndivides conjectures from sure conclusions. The Court in\n\nmindful of caution by the settled principles of law and the\n\ndecisions rendered by this Court that in a given case like this,\n\nwhere the prosecution rests on the circumstantial evidence,\n\nthe prosecution must place and prove all the necessary\n\ncircumstances, which would constitute a complete chain\n\nwithout a snap and pointing to the hypothesis that except the\n\naccused, no one had committed the offence, which in the\n\npresent case, the prosecution has failed to prove.\n\nConclusion:-\n\n24) In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that both the courts below have erred in\n\n 19\n\n\frelying that part of the statement which can be termed as\n\nconfession which were given to the police officer while they\n\nwere in custody and it will be hit by \nSection 26\n of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act,1872 and only that part of the statement which\n\nled to the discovery of various materials would be permissible.\n\nHence, in the absence of any other material evidence against\n\nthe appellants-accused, they cannot be convicted solely on the\n\nbasis of evidence of last seen together with the deceased.\n\n25) In the light of the above discussion, the judgment and\n\norder dated 23.11.2009 passed by the High Court is set aside.\n\nThe appeals are allowed. The appellants who are in custody\n\nshall be set at liberty forthwith, if they are not required in any\n\nother criminal case.\n\n ...…………….………………………J.\n (A.K.

As an exception, \nSection 27\n of the Evidence Act provides\n that a confessional statement made to a police officer or\n while an accused is in police custody, can be proved against\n him, if the same leads to the discovery of an unknown fact.\n The rationale of \nSections 25\n and \n26\n of the Evidence Act is,\n that police may procure a confession by coercion or threat.\n The exception postulated under \nSection 27\n of the Evidence\n Act is applicable only if the confessional statement leads to\n the discovery of some new fact. The relevance under the\n exception postulated by \nSection 27\n aforesaid, is limited “…\n as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered….”. The\n rationale behind \nSection 27\n of the Evidence Act is, that the\n facts in question would have remained unknown but for the\n disclosure of the same by the accused. The discovery of facts\n itself, therefore, substantiates the truth of the confessional\n statement. And since it is truth that a court must endeavour\n to search, \nSection 27\n aforesaid has been incorporated as an\n exception to the mandate contained in \nSections 25\n and \n26\n of\n the Evidence Act.”"
