Before adverting to the factual background of the\n\ncaptioned Criminal Misc. Applications, it is pertinent to mention\n\nhere that the Criminal Misc. Application No.17169 of 2013 came up\n\nfor hearing on 3.12.2014 and upon hearing both the rival parties,\n\nthe said matter was reserved for judgment. However, upon finding\n\nsomething amiss, the said matter was released from CAV and was\n\nheard along with Criminal Misc. Application No.20387 of 2014 on\n\n12.12.2014 and 19.12.2014 since both are cognate matters arising\n\nfrom the Sessions Case No.22 of 2003 filed before the Court of\n\nlearned Sessions Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Ahmedabad.\n\nUpon finally hearing learned counsel for the respective parties on\n\n19.12.2014, the captioned Criminal Misc. Applications was\n\nreserved for judgment. As common and identical question of law\n\nand facts are involved, both the captioned Criminal Misc.\n\nApplications are decided and disposed of by this common\n\njudgment.\n\n2. By these applications, the applicants - original accused\n\nNos.1, 2, 3 and 4 seek to invoke the inherent powers of this Court\n\nunder \nSection 482\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for\n\nquashing of the F.I.R registered vide C. R. No.I-261/2001 at\n\nNavrangpura Police Station, Ahmedabad for the offences\n\npunishable under \nSections 306\n and \n114\n of the Indian Penal Code\n\nand the charge-sheet bearing No.129/2002 dated 24.6.2002.\n\n Page 2 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n3. The case of the prosecution is that deceased\n\nDevangbhai Vimalbhai Shah and Respondent No.2 were husband\n\nand wife and they were working with one B.V.C. Travel Agency Pvt.\n\nLtd., Ahmedabad as Manager and Accountant, respectively. The\n\nmain business of the firm is to take possession of the consignment\n\nin the form of gold, silver, etc. cleared from the airport and to\n\ndeliver the same to the consignee safely. This firm possesses a\n\nstrong room at Deora House running in the name of Deora Vault.\n\nOne of the keys of this strong room used to remain with the\n\ndeceased and the custodian keys used to remain with the owner of\n\nDeora Vault. As per the F.I.R, on 19.5.2001, the Respondent No.2\n\ninquired with the deceased as to why he looks perturbed, to which,\n\nthe deceased informed that the accused herein who is serving as\n\nManager of State Bank of India. Overseas Branch, Gold Desk\n\nOfficer and partners of one firm by the name K.L.Chokshi &\n\nCompany have put the deceased in lot of difficulty and if he is not\n\nable to get out, he would be incurred huge debt. On 6.5.2001, at\n\n10 a.m., the Respondent No.2 received a call from an employee of\n\nthe office informing that the deceased has consumed some\n\npoisonous substance and he is admitted in emergency ward of\n\nV.S.Hospital and later, he was shifted to a hospital in Shahibaug.\n\n4. On 9.5.2001, when the deceased regained\n\nconsciousness, he told Respondent No.2 that a cargo consisting of\n\n Page 3 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n1000 TT Gold Bars was cleared from Ahmedabad Airport on\n\n2.3.2001 and upon oral telephonic instructions of the accused, the\n\ndeceased instructed the employees of the firm to deliver the\n\nconsignment to Guru Exports, a sister concern of K.L.Chokshi &\n\nCompany. The allegations are that the consignment belongs to the\n\nBank and by misleading the deceased, entire consignment of gold\n\nwas usurped by the accused in collusion with the co-accused. It is\n\nfurther alleged that 1000 TT Gold Bars which were of Standard\n\nChartered Bank were deposited in the strong room of the State\n\nBank of India by the deceased on account of pressure and threats\n\nby the accused and when the deceased requested the accused to\n\nsave him from the imbroglio, he was told that he will not get the\n\ngold and silver and if he wants to consume poison, he may do so. As\n\nhe felt that he has no other option, he consumed poison. On\n\n9.5.2001, the Executive Magistrate, Metropolitan Area, Ahmedabad\n\nrecorded dying declaration of the deceased wherein the deceased\n\ntold that the accused herein have caused and created tension\n\nwhich led him to commit suicide. On the same day and on the next\n\nday, i.e. 10.5.2001, statement of the deceased was recorded by the\n\nInvestigating Officer wherein the deceased reiterated the same\n\nallegations and on 17.5.2001, the deceased sustained massive\n\ncardiac attack and passed away. However, on 8.5.2001, one F.I.R.\n\ncame to be lodged against the deceased by one Mr. Percy Madan,\n\nan employee of the firm for the offences punishable under \nSection\n\n408\n and \n420\n of the Indian Penal Code alleging that the deceased\n\n Page 4 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nhas misappropriated the property worth Rs.4,68,12,000/-. Thus, the\n\nmain crux of the charge is that the accused abetted the commission\n\nof suicide by putting the deceased in great difficulty.\n\n5. Per contra, the applicants in Criminal Misc. Application\n\nNo.17169 of 2013 have averred that they have never received 1000\n\nTT Gold Bars as alleged in the complaint on 2.3.2001. On plain\n\nreading of the F.I.R, it is revealed that no allegations have been\n\nmade against the applicants that on their request, the deceased\n\nhad delivered the consignment to the applicants. On the contrary,\n\nit is alleged in the F.I.R that upon telephonic instructions by one\n\nMr.Mohit Srivastava, Officer of the bank and original accused no.1,\n\nthe deceased had delivered the consignment at the place of the\n\napplicants. The applicants further averred that, on 16.3.2001, all\n\napplicants were declared as defaulters of the bank. On 24.3.2001,\n\nC.B.I raided the office and residential premises of the applicants\n\nand accused no.3 was arrested on 26.3.2001 and accused no.2 & 4\n\nwere arrested on 8/9.4.2001 and they were sent to judicial custody\n\nand thereafter released on bail in the month of June and July 2001\n\nrespectively. When the deceased consumed poison on 6.5.2001, the\n\napplicants were in judicial custody much prior to 6.5.2001. Vide\n\nadditional affidavit, the applicants have placed a copy of post\n\nmortem report of the deceased and averred that the doctor has\n\nopined the probable cause of death as \"Cardio Respiratory Failure\"\n\nand as per FSL report; no poisonous content is found in the body of\n\n Page 5 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nthe deceased. Therefore, it cannot be said that the applicants are\n\ninvolved in the offences.\n\n6. As regards delay in filing the present quashing\n\napplication, the applicants have averred that the accused no.1,\n\nMr. Mohit Srivastava had filed Criminal Revision Application\n\nNo.435/2004 before this Court which was decided on 23.8.2012.\n\nThe applicants were under the impressions that if the accused no.1\n\nis discharged then the Court will consider their case as no specific\n\nrole has been attributed to them. However, after the order of this\n\nCourt on 23.8.2012, the present applicants have preferred this\n\nquashing application and therefore the delay caused may not be\n\nconstrued otherwise.\n\n7. Further, the applicant in Criminal Misc. Application\n\nNo.20387 of 2014 has averred that earlier the applicant had\n\npreferred an application before the Court of learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Ahmedabad, seeking\n\ndischarge under \nsection 227\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n1973, which was rejected and thereafter he had preferred Criminal\n\nRevision Application No.435 of 2004 before this Court which came\n\nto be rejected by an order dated 23.8.2012. Against the said order,\n\nthe applicant preferred Special Leave Petition (Criminal)\n\nNo.8/2013 before the Hon'ble Apex Court, which too came to be\n\nrejected on 1.2.2013.\n\n Page 6 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n7.1 The applicant has further averred that from the records\n\nit is crystal clear that the death of the deceased was due to cardio-\n\nrespiratory failure due to pathological changes and therefore it is\n\nnot the outcome of consumption of any poisonous substance and\n\neven no traces of poisonous substance was found in the viscera\n\nwhich was collected and sent to FSL for examination, which is\n\nsuggestive of case of natural death. While deciding the discharge\n\napplication, neither the Trial Court nor this Court has delve into the\n\nvery pertinent aspect as to whether the death of the deceased was\n\nsuicidal. Looking to the post-mortem report and FSL report, it is\n\ncrystal clear that the death of the deceased was not a case of\n\nsuicide as alleged and therefore there is no question of prosecuting\n\nthe applicant for abetment.\n\n7.2. The applicant - the accused No.1 has further averred\n\nthat the entire story put forth by the deceased is concocted and\n\nunbelievable as once the goods cleared from the airport, the BVC\n\nTravels Agency has to pick them and bring them to the strong room\n\nof the State Bank of India or as per the instructions in writing\n\nsigned by two Senior Managers (two level above the applicant). The\n\napplicant herein has no authority to sign the delivery order as per\n\nthe rules of the Bank. It is case of the prosecution that the goods\n\nwere delivered and acknowledged by Guru Exports, however, no\n\nsuch receipt is brought on record. In fact, the statement of the\n\n Page 7 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\ndeceased reveals that he created problems for himself. In case, in\n\neverything is taken as true then the act of the deceased\n\ntransferring Standard Chartered Bank's consignment of gold to the\n\nvault of State Bank of India itself would be an offence and an\n\nillegality committed by the deceased. Except a bald assertion that\n\nthe applicants threatened the deceased to act accordingly, there is\n\nno iota of evidence to even remotely suggest that all these transfers\n\nof consignment were at the instance of the applicants. Even if that\n\nbeing true, he could have immediately informed about this fact to\n\nthe police or to his head office. The deceased kept quite absolutely\n\nand when things were out of control for him and when pressure\n\nwas exerted by his head office to account for the gold consignment\n\nhe came under the bout of depression and tension, Even in the\n\ndepartmental proceedings, the applicant is exonerated and has\n\nbeen granted due promotion and is now working as Chief Manager,\n\nState Bank of India, Kalol Branch. In view of the above\n\ncircumstances, it is evident that prosecution of the applicants for\n\nthe offence\n u/s.306\n of Indian Penal Code is wholly misconceived\n\nand continuation of such prosecution will lead to serious\n\nmiscarriage of justice and abuse of the process of law.\n\n8. Heard Mr. S. I. Nanavati, learned Senior Counsel\n\nassisted by Mr. Saurabh Mehta for the applicants in Criminal Misc.\n\nApplication No.17169 of 2013 and Mr. Umesh Trivedi, Advocate\n\nwith Mr. Rohit Verma, Advocate for the applicant in Criminal Misc.\n\n Page 8 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nApplication No.20387 of 2014 and Ms. Jirga Jhaveri, learned\n\nAdditional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent No.1 in\n\nboth the applications. Though served, no appearance has been\n\nmade on behalf of respondent No.2.\n\n9. Mr.Nanavati, learned Senior Counsel argued that\n\nSections 108\n to \n120\n of the Indian Penal Code deal with abetment.\n\nThe liability of an abettor of a crime is co-extensive with the\n\nliability of the principal offender. Suicide contemplates a situation\n\nwhere the person committing suicide is not available to present his\n\ncase. Therefore, for such an offence, abettor has been made\n\npunishable under \nSection 306\n of the Indian Penal Code. However,\n\nin order to prove the offence under \nSection 306\n of the Indian Penal\n\nCode, it must be first proved that the accused has intentionally\n\ninstigated or driven the deceased to commit suicide or has engaged\n\nanybody in any conspiracy to achieve the desired result. Abetment\n\nwould imply an intentional abetment. Presence of mens rea is\n\nnecessary concomitant of investigation. In the present case, it is\n\nextremely doubtful if all the circumstances taken cumulatively\n\ncould indicate any mens rea on the part of the applicants. Even the\n\ndying declaration and statement before the Investigating Officer\n\ncould not involve the applicants in offence punishable under\n\nSection 306\n of the Indian Penal Code as it provides for abetment of\n\nsuicide. Except one word \"harassment\", nothing is alleged or\n\nexplained by the deceased. There is no evidence to suggest that the\n\n Page 9 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\napplicants knew or had reason to believe that deceased would\n\ncontemplate or commit suicide. \nIn support of his contention,\n\nMr.Nanavati has placed reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in Sanju alias \nSanjay Singh Sengar v. State of\n\nM.P.\n, reported in AIR 2002 SC 1998, wherein the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt has observed in para 13 and 15 as under:-\n\n \"13. Reverting to the facts of the case, both\n the courts below have erroneously accepted\n the prosecution story that the suicide by the\n deceased is the direct result of the quarrel\n that had taken place on 25th July, 1998\n wherein it is alleged that the appellant had\n used abusive language and had reportedly told\n the deceased 'to go and die'. For this, the\n courts relied on a statement of Shashi\n Bhushan, brother of the deceased, made under\n \nSection 161\n Cr.P.C. when reportedly the\n deceased, after coming back from the house of\n the appellant, told him that the appellant had\n humiliated him and abused him with filthy\n words. The statement of Shashi Bhushan,\n recorded under \nSection 161\n Cr.P.C. is annexed\n as annexure P-3 to this appeal and going\n through the statement, we find that he has not\n stated that the deceased had told him that the\n appellant had asked him 'to go and die'. Even\n if we accept the prosecution story that the\n appellant did tell the deceased 'to go and die',\n that itself does not constitute the ingredient of\n 'instigation'. The word 'instigate' denotes\n\n Page 10 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n incitement or urging to do some drastic or\n unadvisable action or to stimulate or incite.\n\n Presence of mens rea, therefore, is the\n necessary concomitant of instigation. It is\n common knowledge that the words uttered in\n a quarrel or in a spur of the moment cannot be\n taken to be uttered with mens rea. It is in a fit\n of anger and emotional. Secondly, the alleged\n abusive words, said to have been told to the\n deceased were on 25th July, 1998 ensued by\n quarrel. The deceased was found hanging on\n 27th July, 1998. Assuming that the deceased\n had taken the abusive language seriously, he\n had enough time in between to think over and\n reflect and, therefore, it cannot be said that\n the abusive language, which had been used by\n the appellant on 25th July, 1998 drived the\n deceased to commit suicide. Suicide by the\n deceased on 27th July, 1998 is not proximate\n to the abusive language uttered by the\n appellant on 25th July, 1998. The fact that the\n deceased committed suicide on 27th July, 1998\n would itself clearly pointed out that it is not\n the direct result of the quarrel taken place on\n 25th July, 1998 when it is alleged that the\n appellant had used the abusive language and\n also told the deceased to go and die. This fact\n had escaped notice of the courts below.\"\n\n \"15. A plain reading of the suicide note would\n clearly show that the deceased was in great\n stress and depressed. One plausible reason\n could be that the deceased was without any\n\n Page 11 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n work or avocation and at the same time\n indulged in drinking as revealed from the\n statement of the wife Smt. Neelam Sengar. He\n was a frustrated man. Reading of the suicide\n note will clearly suggest that such a note is not\n a handy work of a man with sound mind and\n sense. Smt. Neelam Sengar, wife of the\n deceased, made a statement under \nSection\n 161\n Cr.P.C. before the Investigation Officer.\n She stated that the deceased always indulged\n in drinking wine and was not doing any work.\n She also stated that on 26th July, 1998 her\n husband came to them in an inebriated\n condition and was abusing her and other\n members of the family. The prosecution story,\n if believed, shows that the quarrel between the\n deceased and the appellant had taken place on\n 25th July, 1998 and if the deceased came back\n to the house again on 26th July, 1998, it cannot\n be said that the suicide by the deceased was\n the direct result of the quarrel that had taken\n pace on 25th July, 1998. Viewed from the\n aforesaid circumstances independently, we are\n clearly of the view that the ingredients of\n 'abetment' are totally absent in the instant\n case for an offence under \nSection 306\n I.P.C. It\n is in the statement of the wife that the\n deceased always remained in a drunkened\n condition. It is a common knowledge that\n excessive drinking leads one to debauchery. It\n clearly appeared, therefore, that the deceased\n was a victim of his own conduct unconnected\n with the quarrel that had ensued on 25th July,\n\n Page 12 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n 1998 where the appellant is stated to have\n used abusive language. Taking the totality of\n materials on record and facts and\n circumstances of the case into consideration,\n it will lead to irresistible conclusion that it is\n the deceased and he alone, and none else, is\n responsible for his death.\"\n\n9.1 Mr. Umesh Trivei and Mr. Rohit Verma has placed\n\nreliance on the decision of this Court in \nA. K. Chaudhari and\n\nOthers v. State of Gujarat\n, reported in (2005) 3 GLH 444,\n\nwherein this Court has observed in para 17 as under :-\n\n \"17. In view of the above, it appears that the\n ingredients for abetment for suicide would be\n satisfied only if the suicide is committed by the\n deceased due to direct and alarming\n encouragement/incitement by the accused\n leaving no option but to commit suicide.\n Further, as the action of committing suicide is\n also on account of great disturbance to the\n psychological imbalance of the deceased such\n incitement can be divided into two broad\n categories, one normally where the deceased\n is having sentimental tie or physical relations\n with the accused and second category would\n be where the deceased is having relations with\n the accused in official capacity. In case of\n former category some times a normal quarrel\n or the utterance of hot exchange of words may\n result into psychological immediate imbalance.\n Consequently creating situation of depression,\n\n Page 13 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n loss of charm in the life and if the person is\n unable to control sentiments of expectations, it\n may give temptations to the person to commit\n suicide, e.g., when there is relation of husband\n and wife, mother and son, brother and sister,\n sister and sister and other relations of such\n type, where sentimental tie is by blood or due\n to physical relations. In case of second\n category the tie is on account of official\n relations, where the expectations would to\n discharge the obligation as provided for such\n duty in law and to receive the considerations\n as provided in law. In normal circumstances,\n relationships by sentimental tie cannot be\n equated with the official relationship and the\n reason being the different conduct of the\n parties for maintenance of the relations. The\n former category leaves more expectations,\n whereas in the latter category, by and large,\n expectations and obligations are prescribed by\n law, rules and regulations. Of course, for\n meeting with the requirement for ingredients\n of abetment to suicide, the provisions of the\n \nIPC\n are the same, but for the purpose of\n examination on the aspects of abetment to\n commit suicide or incitement/encouragement\n to suicide, it may have some relevance. Since,\n in the present case this Court is not concerned\n with the matter of matter of abetment to\n suicide where the deceased or the accused\n had the relations covered in the first category,\n no further discussion may be required in this\n regard to that extent. However, in case where\n\n Page 14 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n the allegations for abetment of suicide\n committed by the deceased falling in second\n category are concerned, the strict\n interpretation is called for, otherwise it may\n result into damaging the discipline of any\n institution or organization or department,\n which may consequently result into creating a\n situation against national interest for which\n the expectation would be the strict discipline\n and the rule of law only and nothing else.\"\n\n \nMr. Verma has also submitted that the case of the\n\napplicant is also covered by the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\nin the case of \nNetai Dutta v. State of W.B\n, reported in (2005) 2\n\nSCC 659 and in view of the ratio \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt in the aforesaid case, the F.I.R and charge-sheet is required\n\nto be quashed and set aside.\n\n10. In counter, Ms. Jirga Jhaveri, Additional Public\n\nProsecutor strongly opposed the quashing applications and\n\nvehemently argued that the present applicants are the primary\n\nabettors who have driven the deceased to commit suicide. Even the\n\ndying declaration and the statement of the deceased before the\n\nInvestigating Officer indict the present applicants as the abettors in\n\nthe crime. Therefore, the quashing applications are liable to be\n\nrejected at its threshold. She further submitted that specific role\n\nhas been attributed against all the applicants, therefore, the Court\n\nmay not exercise jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of the Code of\n\n Page 15 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nCriminal Procedure, 1973, as the charge is framed against the\n\napplicants. Ms. Jhaveri has placed reliance on the decision of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in Praveen Pradhan v. State of Uttaranchal\n\nand another, reported in (2012) 9 SCC 734, wherein the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has observed in para 18 and 19 as under:-\n\n \"18. In fact, from the above discussion it is\n apparent that instigation has to be gathered\n from the circumstances of a particular case.\n No straight-jacket formula can be laid down to\n find out as to whether in a particular case\n there has been instigation which force the\n person to commit suicide. In a particular case,\n there may not be direct evidence in regard to\n instigation which may have direct nexus to\n suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an\n inference has to be drawn from the\n circumstances and it is to be determined\n whether circumstances had been such which\n in fact had created the situation that a person\n felt totally frustrated and committed suicide.\n More so, while dealing with an application for\n quashing of the proceedings, a court cannot\n form a firm opinion, rather a tentative view\n that would evoke the presumption referred to\n under \nSection 228\n Cr.P.C.\"\n\n \"19. Thus, the case is required to be\n considered in the light of aforesaid settled\n legal propositions. In the instant case, alleged\n harassment had not been a casual feature,\n\n Page 16 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n rather remained a matter of persistent\n harassment. It is not a case of a driver; or a\n man having an illicit relationship with a\n married woman, knowing that she also had\n another paramour; and therefore, cannot be\n compared to the situation of the deceased in\n the instant case, who was a qualified graduate\n engineer and still suffered persistent\n harassment and humiliation and additionally,\n also had to endure continuous illegal demands\n made by the appellant, upon non-fulfillment of\n which, he would be mercilessly harassed by\n the appellant for a prolonged period of time.\n He had also been forced to work continuously\n for a long durations in the factory, vis-a-vis\n other employees which often even entered to\n 16-17 hours at a stretch. Such harassment,\n coupled with the utterance of words to the\n effect, that, \"had there been any other person\n in his place, he would have certainly\n committed suicide\" is what makes the present\n case distinct from the aforementioned cases\n considering the facts and circumstances of the\n present case, we do not think it is a case\n which requires any interference by this court\n as regards the impugned judgment and order\n of the High Court. The appeal is, therefore,\n dismissed accordingly.\"\n\n \nShe has further placed reliance on the decision of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in \nRajinder Prasad v. Bashir and Others\n,\n\nreported in AIR 2001 SC 3524, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court\n\n Page 17 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nhas observed in para 7 and 8 as under:-\n\n \"7. We are of the opinion that when the\n earlier revision petition filed under \nSection\n 397\n of the Code had been dismissed as not\n pressed, the accused-respondents could not be\n allowed to invoke the inherent powers of the\n High Court under \nSection 482\n of the Code for\n the grant of the same relief. We do not agree\n with the arguments of the learned counsel for\n the respondents that as the earlier application\n had been dismissed as not pressed, the\n accused had acquired a right to challenge the\n order adding the offence under \nSection 395\n of\n the Code and arraying four persons as\n accused-persons by way of subsequent petition\n under \nSection 482\n of the Code. The object of\n criminal trial is to render public justice and to\n assure punishment to the criminals keeping in\n view that the trial is concluded expeditiously.\n\n \nDelaying tactics or protracting the\n commencement or conclusion of the criminal\n trial are required to be curbed effectively, lest\n the interest of public justice may suffer. For\n exercising power under \nSection 482\n of the\n Code the learned Judge of the High Court\n relied upon a judgment of this Court in\n \nKrishnan & Anr. v. Krishnaveni & Ors.\n [1997\n (4) SCC 241]. A perusal of the aforesaid\n judgment, however, shows that the reliance by\n the learned Judge was misplaced.\n \nThis Court\n in \nKrishnan\n's case (supra) had held that\n though the power of the High Court under\n\n Page 18 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nSection 482\n of the Code is very wide, yet the\n same must be exercised sparingly and\n cautiously particularly in a case where the\n petitioner is shown to have already invoked\n the revisional jurisdiction under \nSection 397\n of\n the Code. Only in cases where the High Court\n finds that there has been failure of justice or\n misuse of judicial mechanism or procedure,\n sentence or order was not correct, the High\n Court may, in its discretion, prevent the abuse\n of the process or miscarriage of justice by\n exercise of jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of\n the Code. It was further held, \"Ordinarily,\n when revision has been barred by \nSection\n 397(3)\n of the Code, a person -\n\n accused/complainant - cannot be allowed to\n take recourse to the revision to the High Court\n under \nSection 397(1)\n or under inherent\n powers of the High Court under \nSection 482\n of\n the Code since it may amount to\n circumvention of provisions of \nSection 397(3)\n\n or \nSection 397(2)\n of the Code.\".\n\n 8. We are of the opinion that no special\n circumstances were spelt out in the\n subsequent application for invoking the\n jurisdiction of the High Court under \nSection\n 482\n of the Code and the impugned order is\n liable to be set aside on this ground alone\"\n\n \nShe has also placed reliance on the decision of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in \nAmit Kapoor v. Ramesh Chander and\n\nanother\n, reported in (2012) 9 SCC 460, wherein the Hon'ble\n\n Page 19 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nApex Court has observed in para 20 and 27 as under :-\n\n \"20. The jurisdiction of the Court under\n \nSection 397\n can be exercised so as to examine\n the correctness, legality or proprietary of an\n order passed by the trial court or the inferior\n court, as the case may be. Though the section\n does not specifically use the expression\n 'prevent abuse of process of any court or\n otherwise to secure the ends of justice', the\n jurisdiction under \nSection 397\n is a very\n limited one. The legality, proprietary or\n correctness of an order passed by a court is\n the very foundation of exercise of jurisdiction\n under \nSection 397\n but ultimately it also\n requires justice to be done. The jurisdiction\n could be exercised where there is palpable\n error, non-compliance with the provisions of\n law, the decision is completely erroneous or\n where the judicial discretion is exercised\n arbitrarily. On the other hand, \nSection 482\n is\n based upon the maxim quando lex liquid\n alicuiconcedit, conceder videtur id quo res\n ipsa esse non protest, i.e., when the law gives\n anything to anyone, it also gives all those\n things without which the thing itself would be\n unavoidable. The Section confers very wide\n power on the Court to do justice and to\n ensure that the process of the Court is not\n permitted to be abused.\"\n\n \"27. Having discussed the scope of\n jurisdiction under these two provisions, i.e.,\n\n Page 20 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nSection 397\n and \nSection 482\n of the Code and\n the fine line of jurisdictional distinction, now\n it will be appropriate for us to enlist the\n principles with reference to which the courts\n should exercise such jurisdiction. However, it\n is not only difficult but is inherently\n impossible to state with precision such\n principles. At best and upon objective analysis\n of various judgments of this Court, we are\n able to cull out some of the principles to be\n considered for proper exercise of jurisdiction,\n particularly, with regard to quashing of\n charge either in exercise of jurisdiction under\n \nSection 397\n or \nSection 482\n of the Code or\n together, as the case may be :\n\n 27.1) Though there are no limits of the\n powers of the Court under \nSection 482\n of the\n Code but the more the power, the more due\n care and caution is to be exercised in invoking\n these powers. The power of quashing criminal\n proceedings, particularly, the charge framed\n in terms of \nSection 228\n of the Code should be\n exercised very sparingly and with\n circumspection and that too in the rarest of\n rare cases.\n\n 27.2) The Court should apply the test as to\n whether the uncontroverted allegations as\n made from the record of the case and the\n documents submitted therewith prima facie\n establish the offence or not. If the allegations\n are so patently absurd and inherently\n improbable that no prudent person can ever\n\n Page 21 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n reach such a conclusion and where the basic\n ingredients of a criminal offence are not\n satisfied then the Court may interfere.\n\n 27.3) The High Court should not unduly\n interfere. No meticulous examination of the\n evidence is needed for considering whether\n the case would end in conviction or not at the\n stage of framing of charge or quashing of\n charge.\n\n 27.4) Where the exercise of such power is\n absolutely essential to prevent patent\n miscarriage of justice and for correcting some\n grave error that might be committed by the\n subordinate courts even in such cases, the\n High Court should be loathe to interfere, at\n the threshold, to throttle the prosecution in\n exercise of its inherent powers.\n\n 27.5) Where there is an express legal bar\n enacted in any of the provisions of the Code\n or any specific law in force to the very\n initiation or institution and continuance of\n such criminal proceedings, such a bar is\n intended to provide specific protection to an\n accused.\n\n 27.6) The Court has a duty to balance the\n freedom of a person and the right of the\n complainant or prosecution to investigate and\n prosecute the offender.\n\n 27.7) The process of the Court cannot be\n permitted to be used for an oblique or\n\n Page 22 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n ultimate/ulterior purpose.\n\n 27.8) Where the allegations made and as they\n appeared from the record and documents\n annexed therewith to predominantly give rise\n and constitute a 'civil wrong' with no 'element\n of criminality' and does not satisfy the basic\n ingredients of a criminal offence, the Court\n may be justified in quashing the charge. Even\n in such cases, the Court would not embark\n upon the critical analysis of the evidence.\n\n 27.9) Another very significant caution that the\n courts have to observe is that it cannot\n examine the facts, evidence and materials on\n record to determine whether there is\n sufficient material on the basis of which the\n case would end in a conviction, the Court is\n concerned primarily with the allegations\n taken as a whole whether they will constitute\n an offence and, if so, is it an abuse of the\n process of court leading to injustice.\n\n 27.10) It is neither necessary nor is the court\n called upon to hold a full-fledged inquiry or to\n appreciate evidence collected by the\n investigating agencies to find out whether it is\n a case of acquittal or conviction.\n\n 27.11) Where allegations give rise to a civil\n claim and also amount to an offence, merely\n because a civil claim is maintainable, does not\n mean that a criminal complaint cannot be\n maintained.\n\n Page 23 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n 27.12) In exercise of its jurisdiction under\n \nSection 228\n and/or under \nSection 482\n, the\n Court cannot take into consideration external\n materials given by an accused for reaching\n the conclusion that no offence was disclosed\n or that there was possibility of his acquittal.\n\n The Court has to consider the record and\n documents annexed with by the prosecution.\n\n 27.13) Quashing of a charge is an exception to\n the rule of continuous prosecution. Where the\n offence is even broadly satisfied, the Court\n should be more inclined to permit\n continuation of prosecution rather than its\n quashing at that initial stage. The Court is not\n expected to marshal the records with a view\n to decide admissibility and reliability of the\n documents or records but is an opinion\n formed prima facie.\n\n \n27.14) Where the charge-sheet, report under\n \nSection 173(2)\n of the Code, suffers from\n fundamental legal defects, the Court may be\n well within its jurisdiction to frame a charge.\n\n 27.15) Coupled with any or all of the above,\n where the Court finds that it would amount to\n abuse of process of the Code or that interest\n of justice favours, otherwise it may quash the\n charge. The power is to be exercised ex\n debito justitiae, i.e. to do real and substantial\n justice for administration of which alone, the\n courts exist. {Ref. \nState of West Bengal &\n\n Page 24 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n Ors. v.

Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties at\n\nlength and minutely perused the records and proceedings of the\n\nSessions case No.22 of 2003. Upon appreciating the evidence in\n\nchronological order, following undisputed facts emerges from the\n\nrecords of this case :\n\n11.1. It has come on record from the prosecution side that\n\nMr. Naresh Chokshi and Mr. Prashant Chokshi, applicants was\n\narrested on 10.4.2001 and released on bail on 5.7.2001 and\n\nMr.Jignesh Chokshi, applicant was arrested on 30.3.2001 and\n\nreleased on bail on 25.6.2001 in connection with CBI Case\n\nNo.2(E)/2001 CBI BS&FC, Mumbai.\n\n Page 26 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n11.2. On 2.3.2001, alleged incident of delivering 1000 TT\n\nGold Bars to Guru Exports took place. However, no receipt of\n\ndelivery and acknowledgment is brought on record.\n\n11.3. On 6.5.2001, the deceased allegedly consumed some\n\npoisonous substance and was rushed to V.S.Hospital, Ahmedabad\n\nand thereafter shifted to private hospital in Shaibaug.\n\n11.4. On 8.5.2001 a F.I.R. was lodged against the deceased\n\nby B.V.C. Travel Agency Pvt. Ltd allegedly revealing that the\n\ndeceased misappropriated property of 1000 Gold Bars worth\n\nRs.4,68,12,000/- between 4.5.2001 and 6.5.2001.\n\n11.5. The deceased regained consciousness on 9.5.2001\n\nwhereupon he allegedly revealed the turmoil to his wife -\n\nRespondent No.2.

On 17.5.2001, the deceased sustained massive cardiac\n\nattack and passed away.

Having perused the records and considering the rival\n\nsubmissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and\n\n Page 28 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nhaving regard to the nature of the allegations, and looking to the\n\nproposition laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of\n\nAmit Kapoor\n (supra), I am inclined to accept the submissions\n\ncanvassed on behalf of the applicants that the F.I.R and Charge-\n\nSheet deserves to be quashed, for the reasons that :-\n\n13(a) The present applicants in Criminal Misc. Application\n\nNo.17169 of 2013 were in jail since 30.3.2001 and 10.4.2001 and\n\nwere released on bail on 5.7.2001 and 25.6.2001, respectively and\n\nthe alleged consumption of poison by the deceased took place on\n\n6.5.2001. Hence, when the deceased allegedly consumed poison;\n\nprior to that date, the present applicants were in jail, so there\n\nappears no possibility of incitement, instigation or any act to drive\n\nthe deceased to commit suicide.\n\n13(b) It is revealed from the matter available on record that\n\nthe complainant, i.e. Respondent No.2 and the deceased were\n\nworking together in a travel firm, which was owned by the\n\nbrother-in-law of the deceased stationed at Mumbai. It is also\n\nrevealed that an F.I.R. was lodged before the Police Station by an\n\nemployee of the travel firm against the deceased on 8.5.2001. This\n\nfactor might have prompted the deceased to commit suicide. Such\n\npossibility cannot be ruled out as the F.I.R mentions that the\n\ndeceased misappropriated property worth Rs.4,68,12,000/-\n\nbetween 4.5.2001 and 6.5.2001.\n\n Page 29 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n13(c) The complaint was lodged against deceased Devang\n\nShah by one Shri Parsi Rusi Madan alleging that consignment\n\nconsisting of 1000 TT Gold Bars came to be disposed\n\nof/misappropriated by the deceased in between 4.5.2011 and\n\n6.5.2001, whereby the deceased had committed the offence of\n\ncriminal breach of trust and cheating. The aforesaid complaint\n\ncame to be lodged under the instructions from the brother of\n\nDakshaben Shah i.e. brother-in-law of the deceased as per the\n\ninstruction given to the complainant on 5.5.2001 and the deceased\n\nconsumed poison and substance on 6.5.2001. As per the complaint,\n\ncustody of 1000 TT Gold Bars was with the deceased and the same\n\nwas disposed of/misappropriated in between 4.5.2001 and 6.5.2001\n\nand to the same effect, the aforesaid complaint was lodged against\n\nthe deceased himself prior to that period that means from 4.5.2001\n\nto 6.5.2001 and even prior to that period, the petitioners were in\n\njail. The complaint was given on behalf of the company where he\n\nwas serving, gave specific details when the goods came to be\n\nmisappropriated/disposed of during the aforesaid period. Whereas\n\nin the dying declaration and the complaint against the present\n\napplicants only general and vague allegations have been made. At\n\nthe relevant time, the goods were definitely in the custody of the\n\ndeceased as per the complaint against the deceased. In that view of\n\nthe matter, there was no reason to harass or instigation by the\n\napplicants to the deceased to commit suicide.\n\n Page 30 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n13(d) On going through the complaint, it reveals that\n\nRespondent No.2, who is the wife of the deceased was informed by\n\nthe deceased on 6.5.2001, i.e. after consumption of poison, that\n\nthere was instigation from the accused. However, at that relevant\n\ntime, the present applicants were in jail since about 25 days prior\n\nto the incident. Hence, there appears no possibility of incitement,\n\ninstigation or any act on the part of the present applicants to drive\n\nthe deceased to commit suicide.\n\n13(e) On overall perusal of material available on record, this\n\nCourt do not find any proximate reason to infer that the present\n\napplicants caused any abetment and it is nobody's case that the\n\napplicants abetted the deceased to commit suicide from the jail.\n\nFor this simple reason also, instigation of any sort from the\n\napplicants appears to be unbelievable.\n\n13(f) The offence of abetment by instigation depends upon\n\nthe intention of the person who abets and not upon the act which is\n\ndone by the person who has abetted. The abetment may be by\n\ninstigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under \nSection\n\n107\n of the Indian Penal Code. It is true that instigation has to be\n\ngathered from the circumstances of a particular case. There may\n\nnot be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may have\n\ndirect nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has\n\nto be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be determined\n\n Page 31 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nwhether such circumstances in fact created a situation which\n\nwarranted the person to commit suicide. In the present case, there\n\nis no iota of evidence to suggest or indicate any instigation in\n\nwhatsoever manner by the applicants. In fact, the evidence on\n\nrecord suggests that the applicants in Criminal Misc. Application\n\nNo.17169 of 2013 were in judicial custody prior to the date when\n\nthe deceased committed suicide.\n\n13(g) In the instant case, alleged harassment by the\n\napplicants appears to be not a matter of persistent harassment. It\n\nappears to have been mentioned in very casual manner by the\n\ndeceased as no specific role has been attributed to the applicants\n\nby him.\n\n13(h) The post-mortem report reveals that the death of the\n\ndeceased was due to cardio-respiratory failure occurred due to\n\npathological changes. Moreover, FSL report reveals no traces of\n\npoisonous substance in viscera. Thus, the medical evidence\n\nsuggests that the death of the deceased is not caused due to\n\nconsumption of poisonous substance but the death occurred due to\n\ncardio-respiratory failure. There is no nexus between the cause of\n\nthe death of the deceased as well as allegations of harassment.\n\n13(i) The proximate cause appears to be communication of\n\nlodging of complaint by the brother-in-law of the deceased, which\n\nmight have caused the deceased to consume allegedly poisonous\n\n Page 32 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nsubstance.\n\n13(j) From the report submitted by the process serving\n\nagency, it appears that whereabout of the widow of the deceased is\n\nnot known and she is not traceable. She is the sole witness as the\n\ncase of the prosecution is that the deceased had told his turmoil to\n\nhis wife, which is also in the nature of hearsay evidence.\n\n13(k) Dying declaration of deceased Devang Shah was\n\nrecorded by the Executing Magistrate on 9.5.2001 at about 1.15\n\np.m. in question and answer form at page 102 of the paper book,\n\nwherein he has stated that he has attempted to commit suicide and\n\nreason shown by him is that due to harassment made by Mohit\n\nSrivastava and further he had also stated that Mohit Srivastava and\n\nowner of K. L. Chokshi Firm i.e. Naresh, Prashant and Jignesh have\n\ntried to implicate him into the matter.\n\n On perusal of the aforesaid dying declaration and the\n\nstatement made by the deceased, no details as regards to\n\nharassment came to be meted out by the present applicants are\n\nrevealing, only general and vague allegations are made and during\n\nthat period, the applicants were already in jail.\n\n13(l) Allegations made in the dying declaration recorded by\n\nthe Executive Magistrate and in the statement of the deceased\n\nbefore the Investigating Officer appear to be general and vague in\n\n Page 33 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\nnature as no role has been attributed to them and does not inspire\n\nconfidence in its truthfulness and correctness. It appears that the\n\ndying declaration is influenced by other factors such as complaint\n\nlodged against him by his own firm for misappropriating property\n\nworth Rs.4,68,12,000/-. Such statement cannot be relied upon in\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the present case as it appears that\n\nthe deceased has made an attempt to cover up the truth. It is well\n\nsettled law that, if prosecution solely depends on the dying\n\ndeclaration, the normal rule is that the Court must exercise due\n\ncare and caution to ensure genuineness of the dying declaration\n\nkeeping in mind that the accused have no opportunity to test the\n\nveracity of the statement of the deceased by cross examination.\n\n13(m) Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Praveen Pradhan (supra) is\n\nconcerned, on facts, the same would not be of any assistance to the\n\nrespondent, as in this case the alleged harassment is a casual\n\nfeature and not a matter of persistent harassment. \nSimilarly, the\n\ncase of \nRajinder Prasad\n (supra) would not be of any assistance as\n\nthe Hon'ble Apex Court has further observed in para 7 that \"only in\n\ncases where the High Court finds that there has been failure of\n\njustice or misuse of judicial mechanism or procedure, sentence or\n\norder was not correct, the High Court may, in its discretion,\n\nprevent the abuse of the process of miscarriage of justice by\n\nexercise of jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of the Code\".\n\n Page 34 of 36\n\n R/CR.MA/17169/2013 CAV JUDGMENT\n\n13(n) On overall perusal of the material available on record,\n\nthis Court does not find any basic ingredients required to\n\nsubstantiate an offence of \nSection 306\n of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe allegations leveled are inherently improbable.\n\n13(o) This Court is conscious of the fact that \nSection 482\n of\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, as observed by the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court in the case of \nAmit Kapoor\n (supra), is based upon the\n\nmaxim \"quando lex aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur id\n\nsine quo res ipsa esse non potest\", i.e when the law gives anything\n\nto anyone, it also gives all those things without which the thing\n\nitself would be unavoidable. This Court is also conscious of the fact\n\nthat such power is to be exercised \"ex debito justitiae\", i.e. to do\n\nreal and substantial justice for administration of which alone, the\n\nCourt exist.\n\n14. In above view of the matter, this Court is of the\n\nconsidered opinion that this is a fit case wherein the powers under\n\nSection 482\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are required\n\nto be exercised. It is true that such powers are to be exercised\n\nsparingly.\n\n15. For the reasons stated herein-above, these applications\n\nsucceed and are hereby allowed.
