(CRL.) NO. 12301 OF 2023)\n\nKUSHA DURUKA … Appellant(s)\n\nVERSUS\n\nTHE STATE OF ODISHA … Respondent(s)\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nRAJESH BINDAL, J.\n\nLeave granted.\n\n2. This is another case in which an effort has been made to\n\npollute the stream of administration of justice.\n\n3. About three decades ago, this Court in\nChandra Shashi v.\n\nAnil Kumar Verma1\nwas faced with a situation where an attempt was\n\nmade to deceive the Court and interfere with the administration of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\njustice. The litigant was held to be guilty of contempt of court. It was\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nPOOJA SHARMA\n\nDate: 2024.01.19\n\n16:57:27 IST\n\nReason:\n(1995) 1 SCC 421\na case in which husband had filed fabricated document to oppose the\n\nprayer of his wife seeking transfer of matrimonial proceedings.\n\nFinding him guilty of contempt of court, he was sentenced to two\n\nweeks’ imprisonment by this Court. This Court observed as under:\n\n\"1. The stream of administration of justice has to\nremain unpolluted so that purity of court's atmosphere\nmay give vitality to all the organs of the State. Polluters of\njudicial firmament are, therefore, required to be well\ntaken care of to maintain the sublimity of court's\nenvironment; so also to enable it to administer justice\nfairly and to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\n2. Anyone who takes recourse to fraud, deflects\nthe course of judicial proceedings; or if anything is done\nwith oblique motive, the same interferes with the\nadministration of justice. Such persons are required to be\nproperly dealt with, not only to punish them for the\nwrong done, but also to deter others from indulging in\nsimilar acts which shake the faith of people in the\nsystem of administration of justice.\n\n* * *\n\n14. The legal position thus is that if the\npublication be with intent to deceive the court or one\nmade with an intention to defraud, the same would be\ncontempt, as it would interfere with administration of\njustice. It would,in any case, tend to interfere with the\nsame. This would definitely be so if a fabricated\ndocuments is filed with the aforesaid mens rea. In the\ncase at hand the fabricated document was apparently to\ndeceive the court; the intention to defraud is writ large.\nAnil Kumar is, therefore, guilty of contempt.\"\n\n4.\nIn\nK.D. Sharma Vs. Steel Authority of India Limited\nand\n\nothers2 it was observed by this Court:\n\n\"39. If the primary object as highlighted in\nKensington Income Tax Commrs., (1917) 1 KB 486 :\n\n86 LJKB 257 : 116 LT 136 (CA) is kept in mind, an\napplicant who does not come with candid facts and\n\"clean breast\" cannot hold a writ of the court with \"soiled\nhands\". Suppression or concealment of material facts is\nnot an advocacy. It is a jugglery, manipulation,\nmanoeuvring or misrepresentation, which has no place in\nequitable and prerogative jurisdiction. If the applicant\ndoes not disclose all the material facts fairly and truly\nbut states them in a distorted manner and misleads the\ncourt, the court has inherent power in order to protect\nitself and to prevent an abuse of its process to discharge\nthe rule nisi and refuse to proceed further with the\nexamination of the case on merits. If the court does not\nreject the petition on that ground, the court would be\nfailing in its duty. In fact, such an applicant requires to be\ndealt with for contempt of court for abusing the process\nof the court.\" [emphasis supplied]\n(2008) 12 SCC 481\n5.\nIn\nDalip Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh\nand others3, this\n\nCourt noticed the progressive decline in the values of life and the\n\nconduct of the new creed of litigants, who are far away from truth. It\n\nwas observed as under:\n\n\"1. For many centuries Indian society cherished\ntwo basic values of life i.e.\"satya\" (truth) and \"ahinsa\"\n\n(non- violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma\nGandhi guided the people to ingrain these values in\ntheir daily life. Truth constituted an integral part of the\njustice- delivery system which was in vogue in the pre-\nIndependence era and the people used to feel proud to\ntell truth in the courts irrespective of the consequences.\nHowever, post-Independence period has seen drastic\nchanges in our value system. The materialism has\novershadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal\ngain has become so intense that those involved in\nlitigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood,\nmisrepresentation and suppression of facts in the court\nproceedings.\n\n2. In the last 40 years, a new creed of litigants\nhas cropped up. Those who belong to this creed do not\nhave any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to\n(2010) 2 SCC 114\nfalsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals.\n\nIn order to meet the challenge posed by this new\ncreed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time,\nevolved new rules and it is now well established that a\nlitigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or\nwho touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted\nhands, is not entitled to any relief, interim or final.”\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n6.\nIn\nMoti Lal Songara Vs. Prem Prakash @ Pappu\nand\n\nanother4, this Court, considering the issue regarding concealment of\n\nfacts before the Court, observed that \"court is not a laboratory where\n\nchildren come to play”, and opined as under:\n\n\"19. The second limb of the submission is whether\nin the obtaining factual matrix, the order passed by the\nHigh Court discharging the accused-respondent is\njustified in law. We have clearly stated that though the\nrespondent was fully aware about the fact that charges\nhad been framed against him by the learned trial Judge,\nyet he did not bring the same to the notice of the\nrevisional court hearing the revision against the order\ntaking cognizance. It is a clear case of suppression. It was\nwithin the special knowledge of the accused. Any one\nwho takes recourse to method of suppression in a court\nof law, is, in actuality, playing fraud with the court, and\n(2013) 9 SCC 199\nthe maxim supressio veri, expression faisi , i.e.,\nsuppression of the truth is equivalent to the expression of\nfalsehood, gets attracted. We are compelled to say so\nas there has been a calculated concealment of the fact\nbefore the revisional court. It can be stated with certitude\nthat the accused- respondent tried togain advantage by\nsuch factual suppression. The fraudulent intention is writ\nlarge. In fact, he has shown his courage of ignorance and\ntried to playpossum.\n\n20. The High Court, as we have seen, applied the\nprinciple \"when infrastructure collapses, the\nsuperstructure is bound to collapse\". However, as the\norder has been obtained by practising fraud and\nsuppressing material fact before a court of law to gain\nadvantage, the said order cannot be allowed to stand.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n7. It was held in the\njudgments\nreferred to above\nthat one of\n\nthe two cherished basic values by Indian society for centuries is\n\n\"satya\" (truth) and the same has been put under the carpet by the\n\npetitioner. Truth constituted an integral part of the justice-delivery\n\nsystem in the pre-Independence era, however, post-Independence\n\nperiod has seen drastic changes in our value system. The materialism\n\nhas overshadowed the old ethos and the quest for personal gain has\nbecome so intense that those involved in litigation do not hesitate to\n\ntake shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and suppression of facts\n\nin the court proceedings. In the last 40 years, the values have gone\n\ndown and now a litigants can go to any extent to mislead the court.\n\nThey have no respect for the truth. The principle has been evolved to\n\nmeet the challenges posed by this new breed of litigants. Now it is well\n\nsettled that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice or\n\nwho touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not\n\nentitled to any relief, interim or final. Suppression of material facts\n\nfrom the court of law, is actually playing fraud with the court. The\n\nmaxim supressio veri, expression faisi, i.e. suppression of the truth is\n\nequivalent to the expression of falsehood, gets attracted. Its nothing\n\nbut degradation of moral values in the society, may be because of our\n\neducation system. Now we are more happy to hear anything except\n\ntruth; read anything except truth; speak anything except truth and\n\nbelieve anything except truth. Someone rightly said that `Lies are very\n\nsweet, while truth is bitter, that's why most people prefer telling lies.'\n8.\nIn a recent matter, this Court again came across a litigant\n\nwho had tried to overreach the Court by concealing material facts in\n\nSaumya Chaurasia v. Directorate of Enforcement5\n. It was a case\n\nwhere the appellant before this Court had challenged the order\n\npassed by the High Court6 rejecting his bail application. He was\n\naccused of committing various crimes under the\nIndian Penal Code\n\nand the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002\n. His bail\n\napplication was rejected by the High Court on 23.06.2023. In the\n\npleadings before this Court, it was mentioned that the High Court had\n\ncommitted gross error in not considering the chargesheet dated\n\n08.06.2023 and the cognizance order dated 16.06.2023, which clearly\n\nsuggested that there was error apparent on the fact of it. The fact\n\nwhich was available on record was that an order in the bail application\n\nwas reserved by the High Court on 17.04.2023 and pronounced on\n\n23.06.2023. Having some suspicion, this Court directed the appellant\n\nto file an affidavit to clarify the aforesaid position. There was no\n\nspecific reply given to the aforesaid query to the Court. Rather vague\n\nstatements were made. Considering the facts available, this Court\n\nobserved that there was a bold attempt by and on behalf of the\n\nappellant therein to misrepresent the facts for challenging the order\n2023 INSC 1073\nHigh Court of Chhattisgarh at Bilaspur in Miscellaneous Crl. Case No.1258/2023\nimpugned therein, regarding the conduct of the parties and the\n\ncounsel, this Court made the following observations:\n\n“14. It cannot be gainsaid that every party\napproaching the court seeking justice is expected to\nmake full and correct disclosure of material facts and\nthat every advocate being an officer of the court,\nthough appearing for a particular party, is expected to\nassist the court fairly in carrying out its function to\nadminister the justice. It hardly needs to be\nemphasized that a very high standard of\nprofessionalism and legal acumen is expected from\nthe advocates particularly designated Senior\nadvocates appearing in the highest court of the\ncountry so that their professionalism may be followed\nand emulated by the advocates practicing in the High\nCourts and the District Courts. Though it is true that the\nadvocates would settle the pleadings and argue in the\ncourts on instructions given by their clients, however\ntheir duty to diligently verify the facts from the record\nof the case, using their legal acumen for which they are\nengaged, cannot be obliviated.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n8.1. Finally, this Court dismissed the appeal with costs of\n\n₹1,00,000/-.\n9.\nIn\nPradip Sahu v. The State of Assam7\nthe accused who\n\nwas found to be guilty of concealing material facts from the court and\n\nagainst him the High Court8 had directed for taking appropriate legal\n\naction, had challenged the order passed by the High Court before this\n\nCourt. In the aforesaid case, first bail application filed by the appellant\n\nthere was dismissed by the High Court9, thereafter he moved second\n\nbail application before the High Court in which notice was issued on\n\n30.11.2021. During the pendency of the aforesaid application before\n\nthe High Court, the appellant therein moved fresh bail application\n\nbefore the Trial Court on 01.12.2021, which was granted on the same\n\nday. The aforesaid facts came to the notice of the High Court on\n\n08.12.2021 when a report of the Registrar (Judicial) was received, who\n\nwas directed to conduct the enquiry in the matter. However, on an\n\napology tendered by the appellant therein and also considering the\n\nfacts as stated that he belonged to Tea Tribe community and his\n\nbrother, a cycle mechanic, who was also pursuing the case, did not\n\nappreciate the intricacy of the law. As a result of which, the mistake\n\noccurred. This Court, having regard to the unqualified apology\nSpecial Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 4876 of 2022, decided by this Court on 24.08.2023\nGauhati High Court\nOn 11.11.2021\ntendered by the appellant therein, had set aside the order passed by\n\nthe High Court to file FIR/complaint against the appellant therein.\n\n10. May be in the facts of the aforesaid case, this Court had\n\naccepted unconditional apology tendered by the appellant therein\n\nand the given facts situation accepted his apology but it is established\n\nthat there is a consistent effort by the litigants to misrepresent the\n\nCourt wherever they can.\n\n11. The prayer in the present appeal is for grant of bail\n\npending trial. The appellant claimed that he is in custody since\n\n03.02.2022 in connection with crime10 registered under\nSection\n\n20(b)(ii)(C)\nof the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n\n1985. The allegation in the FIR is that the appellant and the co-accused\n\nGangesh Kumar Thakur @ Gangesh Thakur were in exclusive and\n\nconscious possession of 23.8 kg Ganja and were transporting the\n\nsame.\n\n12. The appellant and his co-accused Gangesh Kumar Thakur\n\n@ Gangesh Thakur filed an application for release on bail pending\n\ntrial before the Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Malkangiri\n\nimmediately after their arrest on 03.02.2022. The same was rejected\nFIR No. 29 dated 03.02.2022, at P.S. Orkel, District Malkaganj, Odisha\nvide order dated 04.02.2022. At that stage even the chargesheet had\n\nnot been filed.\n\n12.1 Being aggrieved against the order of rejection of the bail\n\napplication by the Sessions Judge, the appellant filed first bail\n\napplication11 before High Court. While the same was pending the co-\n\naccused Gangesh Thakur also filed bail application12 before the High\n\nCourt. The High Court vide order dated 17.01.2023 allowed the bail\n\napplication filed by Gangesh Kumar Thakur @ Gangesh Thakur.\n\nHowever, the bail application filed by the appellant was dismissed\n\nvide impugned order dated 06.03.2023. Aggrieved against the same,\n\nthe appellant filed the SLP13 before this Court. Notice in the same was\n\nissued on 22.09.2023. When the matter was listed on 08.11.2023,\n\nlearned counsel for the State sought time to file counter affidavit. On\n\n06.12.2023, the learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that\n\nduring the pendency of the present matter before this Court, the High\n\nCourt vide order dated 11.10.2023 had granted bail to the appellant.\n\nAs he did not have hard copy of the order passed by the High Court,\n\nhe placed before us a soft copy of the said order through his mobile\n\nphone. On a reading of the aforesaid order, this Court found that the\nBLAPL No. 1855 of 2022\nBLAPL NO. 11709 of 2022\nSpecial Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 12301 of 2023\nsame neither mentioned the fact that it was the second bail\n\napplication14 filed by the appellant nor pendency of the SLP before\n\nthis Court, in which notice had already been issued. Taking the matter\n\nseriously and deprecating such a practice this Court passed the\n\nfollowing order on 06.12.2023:\n\n“This petition has been filed assailing the correctness\nof order dated 6th March, 2023 passed by the High Court of\nOrissa at Cuttack in BLAPL No. 1855 of 2022, ‘Kusha Duruka\nVersus State of Odisha’ whereby the prayer for bail was\nrejected. Notice was issued by this Court on 22nd September,\n2023.\n\nToday the learned counsel for the petitioner informs\nthis Court that during the pendency of this petition, the High\nCourt has granted bail to the petitioner on 11th October,\n2023. He has placed before us a soft copy of the said order\nthrough his mobile, according to which BLAPL No. 10860 of\n2023 was allowed apparently on the ground of parity\nextended to another co-accused.\n\nFrom reading of the said order, we find that it neither\nmentions that it was the second bail application filed by the\npetitioner before the High Court nor does it reflects any\nreference to the petition pending before this Court in which\nnotice had already been issued in September, 2023.\nBLAPL No. 10860 of 2023\nWe seriously deprecate such practice by the litigant\nand the counsel.\n\nWe accordingly, direct that original record of the said\nbail application, allowed by the High Court on 11th October,\n2023, be called for forthwith.\n\nWe further direct that this order be communicated to\nthe Hon’ble Chief Justice as also the Registrar of the High\nCourt of Orissa forthwith (today itself) and the\naforementioned file of BLAPL No. 10860 of 2023 titled ‘Kusha\nDuruka Versus Versus State of Odisha’ be immediately\nsealed and thereafter be forwarded to this Court.\n\nWe also request the Hon’ble the Chief Justice to obtain\ncomments of the learned Judge as to whether he was\napprised of the aforesaid two facts as recorded earlier in this\norder regarding the bail application being the second bail\napplication and the secondly the pendency of the present\npetition.\n\nThe State of Odisha will also file its comments as to\nwhether the public prosecutor appearing for the State of\nOdisha pointed out such facts or not.\n\nThe report shall be submitted by the Secretary,\nDepartment of Law and Justice of the State of Odisha as also\nby the Joint Secretary or the Additional Secretary (Law)\nattached to the High Court.\n\nList this matter again on 13th December, 2023.”\n13. In terms of the aforesaid order, this Court received the\n\noriginal record pertaining to second bail application filed by the\n\nappellant in which he was granted bail by the High Court vide order\n\ndated 11.10.2023; a report dated 08.12.2023 from the High Court along\n\nwith a note from the Hon’ble Judge who had dealt with the bail\n\napplication filed by the appellant and passed the order on 11.10.2023;\n\naffidavit of Special Secretary, Home Department, Government of\n\nOdisha dated 11.12.2023 and affidavit and report of Principal\n\nSecretary, Law Department, Government of Odisha dated 12.12.2023.\n\n14. Before we deal with the matter, we deem it appropriate to\n\nnote down the dates and events in a tabular form.\n\nDATE EVENTS\n03.02.2022 FIR No.29 dated 03.02.2022 was registered at\nPolice Station Orkel, District Malkangiri,\nOdisha, under\nSection 20(b)(ii)(C)\nof the\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\nAct, 1985.\n\n03.02.2022 The appellant as well as co-accused were\narrested.\n\n04.02.2022 The first bail application filed by the appellant\nas well as the co-accused was rejected by the\nSessions Judge-cum-Special Judge, Malkangiri\n(Special G.R. Case No.38/2022).\nThe appellant approached the High Court for\ngrant of bail by filing bail application bearing\nBLAPL No. 1855 of 2022.\n\nThe co-accused Gangesh Kumar Thakur @\nGangesh Thakur approached the High Court for\ngrant of bail by filing bail application bearing\nBLAPL No.11709 of 2022.\n\nAs is evident from the records available before\nthis Court, bail application filed by the appellant\nwas assigned to Judge ‘A’15.\n\nDuring the pendency of the bail application\nfiled by the appellant, the bail application filed\nby the co-accused Gangesh Kumar Thakur was\nlisted before Judge ‘B’9.\n\n17.01.2023 The bail application filed by the co-accused\nGangesh Kumar Thakur @ Gangesh Thakur was\nallowed by Judge ‘B’; The order does not\nsuggest that the State Counsel had pointed\nbefore the court that there is another bail\napplication filed by the co-accused (the\nappellant) pending consideration before the\ncourt.\n\n06.03.2023 The bail application filed by the appellant was\nrejected by Judge ‘A’; the High Court had\nspecifically recorded in the order that the co-\naccused Gangesh Kumar Thakur @ Gangesh\nWe are consciously not mentioning the name of the Hon’ble Judge\nThakur had been released vide order dated\n17.01.2023.\n\n21.07.2023 Aggrieved against the order rejecting the bail\napplication filed by the appellant, SLP was filed\nbefore this Court.\n\n15.09.2023 During the pendency of the matter before this\nCourt, second bail application filed by the\nappellant was rejected by the Sessions Judge-\ncum-Special Judge, Malkangiri.\n\nThe argument raised by the appellant that the\nco-accused has already been granted the bail,\nis noticed in the order. It does not record the\nfact that a petition filed by the appellant seeking\nbail is pending before this Court.\n\n21.09.2023 While the matter was pending before this Court,\nthe appellant filed second bail application\nbefore the High Court and the same was not\ndisclosed before this Court.\n\n22.09.2023 Notice in the SLP was issued to the respondent.\n11.10.2023 During pendency of the matter before this Court\nJudge ‘B’ granted bail to the appellant.\n\n08.11.2023 Learned counsel for the State appeared and\nsought time for filing counter affidavit to the SLP.\nThough the High Court had already granted bail\nto the appellant but still it was not pointed out\nwhen the matter was taken up by this Court.\n\n06.12.2023 Learned counsel for the appellant pointed out\nbefore this Court that the appellant had already\nbeen released by the High Court. This Court\ncalled for explanation and the record of the case\nfrom the High Court.\n\n15. In the Affidavit dated 11.12.2023 filed by the Principal\n\nSecretary, Law Department, Govt. of Odisha, while narrating the facts\n\nof the case, it was stated that the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nState in the High Court did not have the knowledge of the fact that the\n\nfirst bail application filed by the appellant was rejected on 06.03.2023\n\nby the High Court and also regarding filing of the SLP by the petitioner\n\nbefore this Court.\n\n15.1 The contents of para of the aforesaid affidavit are extracted\n\nbelow:\n\n“It is submitted that the State Counsel before the\nHon’ble High Court of Orissa was not aware of the fact\nthat, earlier BLAPL No.1855/2022 was rejected vide\norder dated 06.03.2023 as well as the fact of filing of\nS.L.P.(Crl.)No.12301/2023. A copy of report of the\nState Counsel is as ANNEXURE-A”\n\n15.2 Along with the affidavit a report from the State Counsel was\n\nalso annexed. It was mentioned therein that in second bail application\n\nthough the appellant had disclosed about filing of his first bail\napplication, he had not disclosed any fact regarding pendency of the\n\nSLP before this Court. It was further mentioned that in the list of dates\n\nthe factum of rejection of earlier bail application or filing of the SLP\n\nwas not mentioned. Even at the time of hearing this fact was not\n\ndisclosed. Learned State Counsel did not have any instructions from\n\nthe Inspector Incharge regarding pendency of the present petition\n\nbefore this Court.\n\n15.3 To similar effect is the affidavit filed by the Special\n\nSecretary, Home Department, Govt. of Odisha.\n\n16. In compliance to the order dated 06.12.2023 passed by this\n\nCourt, a report has been received from the High Court. The comments\n\nof Judge ‘B’, as requested, were annexed with the report and original\n\nfile of second bail application of appellant was also received from the\n\nHigh Court. It is mentioned therein that at the time of hearing of the\n\nsecond bail application, the court was not apprised of the factum of\n\npendency of the SLP before this Court, in which notice had already\n\nbeen issued on 22.09.2023.\n\n16.1 A copy of Standing Order No.2 of 2023, in partial\n\nmodification of earlier Standing Order No.1 of 2020 issued by the High\n\nCourt on 21.05.2023, was annexed with the report. It was issued in\n\npursuance to the observation made by this Court in\nPradhani Jani v.\nThe State of Odisha16\n. The Standing Order was issued with reference\n\nto the listing of the bail applications under\nSections 438\nand\nCr.P.C. Para 2 of the Standing Order with reference to the bail\n\napplications under\nSection 439\nCr.P.C. is extracted below:\n\n“2. The subsequent bail applications under\n\nsection 439\nCr.P.C. including applications for\ninterim bail shall be listed before the Hon'ble Judge\nwho, at the earliest, decided any of the earlier bail\napplications under\nsection 439\nCr.P.C. arising out of\nthe same FIR (decided on merit or disposed of as\nwithdrawn/not pressed). In the event the Hon'ble\nJudge is not available on account of superannuation,\ntransfer etc. or recuses, the said application shall be\nlisted before the Hon'ble Judge who next disposed\nof any of those bail applications, and so on. If none\nof the Hon'ble Judges who decided the earlier bail\napplications is available, the application shall be\nlisted before the regular Bench as per roster.”\n\n17. In substance, it was directed that the Stamp Reporting\n\nSection will verify in case any bail application arising out of the same\n\nFIR has been disposed of earlier. The Stamp Reporting Section shall\n\nfurnish complete details. The subsequent bail applications are to be\n\nlisted before the same Judge. However, in case of non-availability or\nCriminal Appeal No.1503/2023 decided on 15.05.2023\nsuperannuation of the that Judge, alternate system has been provided.\n\nIt is further directed that while listing the subsequent bail application,\n\nfinal order(s) of earlier bail application(s) arising out of the same FIR\n\nshall be tagged. To put the record straight, the order passed by this\n\nCourt in Pradhani Jani’s case (supra) is extracted hereinbelow:\n\n“3. The perusal of the paper books would\nreveal that various applications filed by various\naccused have been entertained by different learned\nSingle Judges of the same High Court. In many of the\nHigh Courts, the practice followed is that the\napplications arising out of the same FIR should be\nplaced before one Judge. However, it appears that it is\nnot the practice in Orissa High Court. In the present\ncase, we have come across orders passed by at least\nthree different Judges in the applications of various\naccused arising out of same FIR.\n\n4. Such a practice leads to anomalous\nsituation. Certain accused are granted bail whereas\ncertain accused for the very same crime having similar\nrole are refused bail.\n\n5. We, therefore, quash and set aside the\nimpugned order dated 31.01.2023 and remand the\nmatter back to the High Court. The High Court is\nrequested to consider the effect of the orders passed by\nthe other coordinate Benches and pass orders afresh.\nThe same shall be done within a period of one month\nfrom today.\n\n6. The Registrar (Judicial) of the Registry of this\nCourt is directed to forward a copy of this order to the\nRegistrar General of the Orissa High Court, who is\nrequested to take note of the aforesaid and consider\npassing appropriate order so that contrary orders in the\nsame crime are avoided.”\n\n18. A perusal of the paper book in second bail application\n\nshows that there is a report annexed by the Registry in the matter. It\n\nmentioned about the earlier two bail applications filed in the FIR in-\n\nquestion. The first bail application filed by the appellant was disposed\n\nof on 06.03.2023. Bail application filed by the co-accused Gangesh\n\nKumar Thakur was disposed of on 17.01.2023. The next one was the\n\nsecond bail application filed by the appellant. Though Standing Order\n\nNo.2 of 2023 directed the Registry to annex all the orders passed in\n\nthe earlier bail applications by different accused in the same FIR,\n\nhowever, the order passed by the High Court in the case of the\n\nappellant, rejecting his earlier bail application, does not form part of\n\nthe bail application before the High Court. Only the order dated\n\n17.01.2023 passed in the bail application, filed by the co-accused\n\nGangesh Kumar Thakur was annexed. Further, in the list of dates and\n\nevents, the appellant did not mention regarding disposal of his earlier\nbail application by the High Court and also filing of the SLP in this\n\nCourt. Though, just below the name of the parties, the appellant had\n\nmentioned the number of earlier bail application filed by him. Even\n\nin the body of the bail application, the appellant has conspicuously\n\nremained silent about the dismissal of his earlier bail application by\n\nthe High Court and filing of the SLP before this Court. During the\n\npendency of the matter before this court a fresh bail application was\n\nfiled not only before the Trial Court but even before the High Court.\n\nThe High Court even granted bail to the appellant. In the bail\n\napplication filed before the High Court, it was not mentioned that the\n\nsame was second bail application filed by the appellant. This Court\n\ncannot comment on the contents of the bail application filed before the\n\nSessions Judge as the copy thereof is not available on record here.\n\n19. It is further evident from the order dated 17.01.2023 vide\n\nwhich bail application, BLAPL NO.11709 of 2022 of the co-accused\n\nGangesh Kumar Thakur was allowed by the High Court by Judge ‘B’.\n\nLearned State Counsel did not point out the factum of pendency of\n\nanother bail application filed by the co-accused arising out of the same\n\nFIR at that stage. The concerned investigating officer must be aware\n\nof this fact but had not pointed out the same before the court.\n20. In our opinion, to avoid any confusion in future it would be\n\nappropriate to mandatorily mention in the application(s) filed for grant\n\nof bail:\n\n(1) Details and copies of order(s) passed in the\nearlier bail application(s) filed by the petitioner which\nhave been already decided.\n\n(2) Details of any bail application(s) filed by the\npetitioner, which is pending either in any court, below the\ncourt in question or the higher court, and if none is\npending, a clear statement to that effect has to be made.\n\nThis court has already directed vide order\npassed in Pradhani Jani’s case (supra) that all bail\napplications filed by the different accused in the same FIR\nshould be listed before the same Judge except in cases\nwhere the Judge has superannuated or has been\ntransferred or otherwise incapacitated to hear the matter.\nThe system needs to be followed meticulously to avoid any\ndiscrepancies in the orders.\n\nIn case it is mentioned on the top of the bail\napplication or any other place which is clearly visible, that\nthe application for bail is either first, second or third and so\non, so that it is convenient for the court to appreciate the\narguments in that light. If this fact is mentioned in the order,\nit will enable the next higher court to appreciate the\narguments in that light.\n\n(3) The registry of the court should also annex a\nreport generated from the system about decided or\npending bail application(s) in the crime case in question.\n\nThe same system needs to be followed even in the case of\nprivate complaints as all cases filed in the trial courts are\nassigned specific numbers (CNR No.), even if no FIR\nnumber is there.\n\n(4) It should be the duty of the Investigating\nOfficer/any officer assisting the State Counsel in court to\napprise him of the order(s), if any, passed by the court with\nreference to different bail applications or other\nproceedings in the same crime case. And the counsel\nappearing for the parties have to conduct themselves truly\nlike officers of the Court.\n\n21. Our suggestions are with a view to streamline the\n\nproceedings and avoid anomalies with reference to the bail\n\napplications being filed in the cases pending trial and even for\n\nsuspension of sentence.\n\n22. Though considering the conduct of the petitioner, one of\n\nthe option available was to cancel his bail, however, we do not\n\npropose to take such an extreme step in the case in hand. However,\n\nthis can be the option exercised by the Court if the facts of the case so\n\ndemand seeing the conduct of the parties.\n\n23. The present appeal is, accordingly, dismissed as\n\ninfructuous. However, still we deem it appropriate to burden the\n\nappellant with a token cost of ₹10,000/-, which shall be deposited by\nhim with Mediation and Conciliation Centre, attached to Orissa High\n\nCourt, within a period of eight weeks from today. Within two weeks\n\nthereafter, proof of deposit be furnished in this Court.\n\n24. A copy of the order be sent to the Registrars General of all\n\nthe High Courts to be placed before the Chief Justices for correction\n\nof the system, wherever required, as this Court comes across similar\n\nissues from different High Courts.\n\n25. The original record received from the High Court be sent\n\nback.\n\n…..………………….…..J\n(VIKRAM NATH)\n\n…………………………..J\n(RAJESH BINDAL)\n\nNew Delhi\nJanuary 19, 2024.\n\n26",

NO. 12301 OF 2023)  KUSHA DURUKA … APPELLANT(S)  VERSUS  THE STATE OF ODISHA … RESPONDENT(S)  JUDGMENT  RAJESH BINDAL, J.  LEAVE GRANTED.  2. THIS IS ANOTHER CASE IN WHICH AN EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO  POLLUTE THE STREAM OF ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.  3. ABOUT THREE DECADES AGO, THIS COURT IN CHANDRA SHASHI V.  ANIL KUMAR VERMA1 WAS FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE AN ATTEMPT WAS  MADE TO DECEIVE THE COURT AND INTERFERE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF  SIGNATURE NOT VERIFIED  JUSTICE. THE LITIGANT WAS HELD TO BE GUILTY OF CONTEMPT OF COURT. IT WAS  DIGITALLY SIGNED BY  POOJA SHARMA  DATE: 2024.01.19  16:57:27 IST  REASON: (1995) 1 SCC 421 A CASE IN WHICH HUSBAND HAD FILED FABRICATED DOCUMENT TO OPPOSE THE  PRAYER OF HIS WIFE SEEKING TRANSFER OF MATRIMONIAL PROCEEDINGS.  FINDING HIM GUILTY OF CONTEMPT OF COURT, HE WAS SENTENCED TO TWO  WEEKS’ IMPRISONMENT BY THIS COURT. THIS COURT OBSERVED AS UNDER:  \"1. THE STREAM OF ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE HAS TO REMAIN UNPOLLUTED SO THAT PURITY OF COURT'S ATMOSPHERE MAY GIVE VITALITY TO ALL THE ORGANS OF THE STATE. POLLUTERS OF JUDICIAL FIRMAMENT ARE, THEREFORE, REQUIRED TO BE WELL TAKEN CARE OF TO MAINTAIN THE SUBLIMITY OF COURT'S ENVIRONMENT; SO ALSO TO ENABLE IT TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE FAIRLY AND TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL CONCERNED.  2. ANYONE WHO TAKES RECOURSE TO FRAUD, DEFLECTS THE COURSE OF JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS; OR IF ANYTHING IS DONE WITH OBLIQUE MOTIVE, THE SAME INTERFERES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. SUCH PERSONS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROPERLY DEALT WITH, NOT ONLY TO PUNISH THEM FOR THE WRONG DONE, BUT ALSO TO DETER OTHERS FROM INDULGING IN SIMILAR ACTS WHICH SHAKE THE FAITH OF PEOPLE IN THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE.  * * *  14. THE LEGAL POSITION THUS IS THAT IF THE PUBLICATION BE WITH INTENT TO DECEIVE THE COURT OR ONE MADE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEFRAUD, THE SAME WOULD BE CONTEMPT, AS IT WOULD INTERFERE WITH ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. IT WOULD,IN ANY CASE, TEND TO INTERFERE WITH THE SAME. THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE SO IF A FABRICATED DOCUMENTS IS FILED WITH THE AFORESAID MENS REA. IN THE CASE AT HAND THE FABRICATED DOCUMENT WAS APPARENTLY TO DECEIVE THE COURT; THE INTENTION TO DEFRAUD IS WRIT LARGE. ANIL KUMAR IS, THEREFORE, GUILTY OF CONTEMPT.\"  4. IN K.D. SHARMA VS.
