W.P.Nos.15417/2012 and 15636-15664/2012 were filed\n\nby the in-service doctors assailing the inclusion of respondent\n\nNos.5 to 168 therein in the provisional departmental merit\n\nlist. Respondent Nos.5 to 66 therein are doctors absorbed as\n\nregular doctors under the provisions of Karnataka Civil\n\nService (Absorption of Doctors appointed on Contract Basis in\n\nthe Karnataka Directorate of Health and Family Welfare\n\nServices) (Special) Rules, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as 'the\n\nAbsorption Rules, 2006' for the sake of brevity). Similarly,\n\nrespondent Nos.67 to 124 in the writ petitions are absorbed\n\nunder the aforesaid Rules of 2007 (hereinafter referred to as\n\n'the Absorption Rules, 2007') and respondent Nos.125 to\n\n168 in the said writ petitions are doctors appointed by direct\n\nrecruitment in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. The learned\n\nSingle Judge dismissed the said writ petitions, against which\n\nWrit Appeal Nos.3004-3018/2012 and Writ Appeal Nos.3020-\n\n3034/2012 have been filed by a batch of thirty petitioners. In\n\nview of the dismissal of the aforesaid writ petitions,\n\nW.P.Nos.15807-15810/2012 and W.P.Nos.15811-\n\n15812/2012 and W.P.Nos.15813-15816/2012 were allowed,\n\nwherein the circulars and ranking list issued pursuant to the\ninterim orders granted in W.P.No.15417/2012 and\n\nW.P.Nos.15636-634/2012 and W.P.Nos.15365-66/2012 were\n\nassailed. The circulars and the ranking list issued pursuant\n\nto the interim orders were quashed by the learned Single\n\nJudge.\n\n3. W.P.Nos.16337-16349/2012 were filed by the doctors\n\nappointed initially on contract basis and later by direct\n\nrecruitment in 2007 and 2009. These writ petitions were also\n\nallowed by the learned Single Judge. W.P.Nos.15365-\n\n15366/2012 also assailed the notification dated 21.02.2012.\n\nThey were filed by doctors who were initially appointed on\n\ncontract basis and absorbed by the Absorption Rules, 2006\n\nwhile W.P.No.15365/2012 was dismissed as not pressed.\n\nW.P.No.15366/2012 was dismissed on merits. That apart,\n\nW.A.Nos.2978-2996/2012 are filed by nineteen doctors who\n\nwere not parties to the writ petitions, being aggrieved by the\n\norder of the learned Single Judge with regard to\n\nW.P.Nos.15807-15810/2012, W.P.Nos.15811-15812/2012\n\nand W.P.Nos. 15813-15816/2012.\n4. To complete the details of the writ petitions filed and\n\ndisposed of by the learned Single Judge, it is also necessary\n\nto note that W.P.No.14430/2012 was disposed of with a\n\ndirection to the respondent authorities to consider the\n\npetitioner's representation dated 17.04.2012 and pass\n\nappropriate orders thereon within a period of four days. In\n\npara 80 of the order, the learned Single Judge has directed as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"80. As these petitions are filed by the in-service\ndoctors appointed in different years and from\ndifferent sources making the claims and counter-\nclaims, the matter required considered hearing. To\nward off the confusion and uncertainty, I directed\nthe maintenance of status quo in respect of the\ncounseling, which has already taken place and\nstayed all further counseling proceedings. The\nsame was by my interim order, dated 24.5.2012.\nAs the interim order continued to be in force from\n24.5.2012 till 8.6.2012, I deem it necessary and\njust to direct the extension of time for the completion\nof the counseling process for admission to\npostgraduate medical courses from the in-service\ncategory of doctors till 15.6.2012.\"\nIt is in the above circumstances, we have heard these\n\nwrit appeals together and the same are disposed of by this\n\ncommon judgment.\n\nFactual Matrix:\n\n5. The controversy in general in these writ appeals\n\npertains to the admission to Post-graduate medical and\n\ndental degree and diploma courses, (but specifically with\n\nregard to medical courses) of doctors working in various\n\nDepartments of the State Government and other Authorities\n\nas in-service candidates. The respondent-Rajiv Gandhi\n\nUniversity of Health Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the\n\n'respondent-University') issued a notification dated\n\n21.11.2011 calling upon the eligible candidates to apply for\n\nthe Entrance Test for admission to Post-Graduate Medical\n\nand Dental Courses. A brochure viz., \"PG Entrance Test-\n\n2012\" containing the details of Post-Graduate Entrance Test\n\nfor Admission to Medical and Dental Courses for the\n\nacademic year 2012-13 was also issued. The respondent-\n\nUniversity is responsible for conducting the Entrance Test\n\nunder the provisions of the Karnataka Conduct of Entrance\nTest for Selection and Admission to Post-Graduate Medical\n\nand Dental Degree and Diploma Courses Rules, 2006\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the PGET Rules, 2006' for the\n\nsake of brevity). As per the said brochure, the in-service\n\ncandidates were required to submit their applications through\n\nproper channel i.e., the Heads of the Department in which\n\nthey are working to the respondent-University. The last date\n\nfor receipt of applications was 31.12.2011. The Entrance Test\n\nwas conducted on 29.01.2012. The results were announced\n\non 13.02.2012. The announcement of the merit list was on\n\n20.02.2012. The Commissioner for Health and Family\n\nWelfare Services issued a Circular on 16.05.2012 listing out\n\nthe candidates eligible to attend the counseling to be\n\nconducted by the respondent-University on 17.05.2012. The\n\nsaid Circular was issued pursuant to the interim order dated\n\n15.05.2012 granted in W.P.Nos.15365-15366/2012,\n\nW.P.Nos.15417/2012 and W.P.Nos.15636-15664/2012.\n\nBeing aggrieved by the Circular dated 16.05.2012,\n\nW.P.Nos.15807-15810/2012, W.P.Nos.15811-15812/2012\n\nand 15813-15816/2012 were filed assailing the Circular\n\ndated 16.05.2012 and also seeking a direction to permit the\nsaid petitioners to be counseled in in-service quota in medical\n\nstream on 17.05.2012.\n\n6. In fact, even prior to the issuance of the Circular dated\n\n16.05.2012, by notification dated 04.05.2012, the\n\nrespondent-University had fixed the first round of counseling\n\nfor admission to Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Courses\n\non the basis of the provisional rank list issued on 11.04.2012.\n\nBut the final departmental merit list had not yet been\n\npublished though the date for counseling had been notified.\n\nBeing aggrieved by the amendment made to the Absorption\n\nRules 2006, 2007 and 2009 by notification dated 21.02.2012\n\nas well as notification issued on 18.01.2011 and 07.04.2011\n\nwhereby an amendment was made to the PGET Rules, 2006,\n\nW.P.No.15417/2012 and connected matters and\n\nW.P.Nos.15365-15366/2012 were filed against the inclusion\n\nof respondent Nos.5 to 168 in the writ petitions, in the\n\nprovisional merit list, in which interim orders were granted by\n\nthis court. By interim order dated 15.05.2012, the said\n\nnotifications, giving retrospective effect from 30.12.2011 were\n\nstayed until further orders. Similarly, in W.P.Nos.15365-\n15366/2012, the notification dated 21.02.2012 (Annexure-B\n\nto the writ petition) giving retrospective effect to the\n\nnotification dated 21.02.2012 and consequential proceedings\n\ninitiated by the respondent-authorities were stayed by interim\n\norder dated 15.05.2012.\n\n7. The grievance of the in-service doctors who filed the\n\nsubsequent batch of writ petitions was with regard to their\n\nexclusion from counseling as a result of the issuance of\n\nCircular dated 16.05.2012 in the wake of interim order in\n\nW.P.Nos.15365-16366/2012, wherein the notification dated\n\n21.02.2012 omitting the condition that the Absorbed doctors\n\ncould not be deputed for higher studies for a period of six\n\nyears from the date of absorption was assailed. Annexure-Q\n\nis the Circular dated 16.05.2012 in W.P.Nos.15807-\n\n15810/2012 and connected writ petitions.\n\nRelevant Acts and Rules:\n\n8. Having regard to the reliefs sought by various groups of\n\nin-service candidates, reference to the relevant Acts and Rules\n\nwhich apply needs to be made at this stage itself, so as to\nhave a clear understanding of the elaborate arguments made\n\nby learned counsel on behalf of various categories of in-\n\nservice candidates.\n\n9. During the last decade and half, the State of Karnataka\n\nhad appointed a number of doctors on contract basis without\n\nresorting to direct recruitment. Though these doctors may\n\nhave been appointed through a regular process of selection on\n\nthe basis of merit, they were not doctors regularly appointed\n\nin accordance with the Rules of Recruitment of the State\n\nGovernment. Since they were appointed on contract basis\n\nand had served for a considerable length of time, the State\n\nGovernment took a decision to absorb them into service in the\n\nDepartment of Health and Family Welfare. Accordingly, the\n\nAbsorption Rules were notified in the years 2006, 2007 and\n\n2009 i.e., on 16.03.2006, 06.07.2007 and 29.01.2010\n\nrespectively. Rules 3 and 5 of Absorption Rules, 2006 read as\n\nunder:\n\n\"3. Absorption of Contract Doctors in the\nDirectorate of Health and Family Welfare\nServices into the State Civil Services:- (1)\nNotwithstanding anything contained in the\nKarnataka State Civil Services (General\nRecruitment) Rules, 1977 or the Karnataka\nDirectorate of Health & Family Welfare Services\n(Recruitment) Rules, 1965 or any other rules made\nfor deemed to have been made under the provisions\nof the\nKarnataka State Civil Services Act, 1978\n\n(Karnataka Act\n14 of 1990) every Contract Doctor\nmentioned in column (2) of the Schedule and\ncontinued as such on the date of commencement of\nthese rules, shall with effect from such date of\ncommencement be absorbed in the corresponding\ncategory of post and pay scale specified in columns\n(5) and (6) thereof, respectively, in the Directorate of\nHealth and Family Welfare Services.\n\nProvided that no such person shall be\nabsorbed:\ni) if he was disqualified for appointment under\nthe Karnataka Civil Services (General\nRecruitment)Rules, 1977 on the date of his\n\nappointment as Doctor on contract basis;\n\nii) if he does not possess the minimum academic\nqualification, specified in the rules of recruitment\napplicable for recruitment to the said post;\n\niii) in any post reserved for the persons\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes or other Backward Classes to which he was\nappointed as contract Doctor, if he is found to be\nnot belonging to such Castes, Tribes or Classes, as\nthe case may be otherwise such posts shall be\nfilled by process of special recruitment from among\nthese classes.\n\n(2) The Contract Doctor who are absorbed under\nthese rules, shall after absorption, work atleast for\nthe period of six years from the date of\ncommencement of these rules, at first in rural areas\nand shall not be deputed for higher studies during\nthat period.\n\n* * *\n\n5. Application of other rules: The provisions of\nthe Karnataka Civil Services Rules, the Karnataka\nCivil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1966 and all other\nrules regulating the conditions of service of\nGovernment Servants insofar as they are not\ninconsistent with the provisions of these rules, shall\napply to persons absorbed under these rules.\"\n\nThe Absorption Rules 2007 are similar to Absorption\nRules, 2006 except with regard to sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 which\nreads as follows:\n\n\"(2) The Contract Doctors who are absorbed under\nthese rules, shall after absorption, work atleast for\nthe period of ten years from the date of\ncommencement of these rules, at first in rural\nareas. They will not be eligible to be deputed for\nhigher studies for a period of six years from the\ndate of absorption.\"\n\nIn the same vein, sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 of Absorption\n\nRules, 2009 reads as follows:\n\n\"(2) The Contract Doctors who are absorbed under\nthese rules, shall from the date of absorption, work\natleast for the period of six years in rural areas and\nshall not be eligible for deputation for higher\nstudies during that period.\"\n\n10. When the matters stood thus, the State Government by\n\nnotifications dated 30.12.2011 published the Draft\n\nAmendment Rules to the Absorption Rules, 2006, 2007 and\n\n2009. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 3 of the said Rules were sought to\n\nbe amended. Further, the amendments were to take effect\n\nfrom 30.12.2011. Objections were invited to the said Draft\n\nRules. Thereafter, on 21.02.2011, the Amendment Rules\n\nwere notified. As per the amendment made to the Absorption\n\nRules, 2006, in sub-rule (2) of Rule 3, the following words\n\nwere omitted viz., \"and shall not be deputed for higher studies\n\nduring that period.\" In Absorption Rules, 2007, in sub-rule\n\n(2) of Rule 3, the following words were omitted viz., \"they will\nnot be eligible to be deputed for higher studies for a period of\n\nsix years from the date of absorption.\" Similarly, in Absorption\n\nRules, 2009, the amendment was omission of the following\n\nwords viz., \"and shall not be deputed for higher studies during\n\nthat period.\"\n\n11. Sub-rule(2) of Rule 3 of the Absorption Rules provided\n\nthat the contract doctors on being absorbed, had to work\n\natleast for a period of six years in rural areas and were\n\nineligible for deputation for higher studies during that period.\n\nIn fact, under the Absorption Rules of 2006 and 2007, six\n\nyears of rural service was to be the first six years after\n\nabsorption. In the 2009 Rules, however, the absorbed\n\ndoctors had to work atleast for six years in rural areas. But\n\nin all the three sets of Absorption Rules, the absorbed doctors\n\nwho were working in rural areas were not to be deputed for\n\nhigher studies during that period. By virtue of amendments\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules, 2006, 2007 and 2009 by way\n\nof omission in sub-rule (2) of Rule 3, the embargo on the\n\nabsorbed doctors to be deputed for higher studies for an\n\ninitial period of six years from the date of absorption, during\nwhich period the absorbed doctors were to serve in rural\n\nareas was lifted. Therefore, the controversy is as to whether\n\nthe absorbed doctors under the Absorption Rules have now\n\nbecome eligible for deputation for higher studies.\n\n12. At this stage itself, it is relevant to refer to the Rules\n\nRegulating Deputation of or Grant of Study Leave to\n\nGovernment Servants for Prosecution of Special Course of\n\nStudy consisting of Higher Studies or Specialised Training\n\nwithin India (hereinafter referred to as 'Deputation Rules' for\n\nthe sake of convenience) on which reliance has been placed\n\nby the appellants. These Rules are contained in Appendix-II-\n\nA to Rule 61 of the Karnataka Civil Services Rules, 1958\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'KCSR' for the sake of brevity) have\n\nbeen deemed to be enacted as part of the\nKarnataka State\n\nCivil Services Act, 1978\n(hereinafter referred to as the 'the\n\nAct' for the sake of brevity) by virtue of\nSection 3(3)(iii)\nof the\n\nsaid Act. The said Act is in force with effect from 30.05.1990.\n\nRule 61 reads as follows:\n\n\"61. (1)(a) The State Government may, with due\nregard to the exigencies of public service, depute or\ngrant study leave to a Government servant for\nprosecution of a special course of study consisting\nof higher studies or specialised training in\nprofessional or technical subjects having a direct\nand close connection with the sphere of his duty.\n\n(b) The State government may also grant study\nleave to a Government servant for prosecution of\nstudies which may not be closely or directly\nconnected with his work but which are capable of\nwidening his mind in a manner likely to improve his\nabilities as a civil servant and to equip him better to\ncollaborate with those employed in the other\nbranches of public service.\n\n(2) A Government servant who is deputed or\ngranted study leave for higher studies or\nspecialised training shall not be entitled to claim\nany monetary benefit or seniority by virtue of the\nhigher qualification or training acquired.\n\n(3) The deputation or grant of study leave to a\nGovernment servant for prosecution of higher\nstudies or specialised training shall be regulated in\naccordance with the rules contained in Appendix II-\n\nA.\"\nRules 1, 4 and 5 of Appendix-II-A the Deputation Rules,\n\nwhich are relevant for the purpose of the present case read as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"APPENDIX II-A\n\nRules regulating deputation of or grant of\nstudy leave to Government servants for\nprosecution of special course of study\nconsisting of higher studies or specialised\ntraining within India\n\n1.

The restriction in regard\nto length of service and age will not apply to\ndeputation of Government servants for foundation\nrefresher courses of training or any in-service\ntraining of short-term duration not exceeding three\nmonths.\n\nx x x\n\n4. the number of Government servants to be\ndeputed at any point of time for higher studies or\nspecialised training shall be kept at the minimum,\nnot exceeding 5% of the sanctioned permanent\nstrength of the concerned cadre.\n\n5. The selection of a candidate for higher studies or\nspecialised training shall be made strictly on the\nbasis of seniority except for reasons to be recorded\nin writing.\"\n\n13. The State Government by order dated 29.01.2010 has\n\nordered that the contractual service rendered in the past\n\nunder the contractual appointment by those doctors working\n\nas General Duty Medical Officers in the Health and Family\n\nWelfare Department should be taken into consideration only\n\nfor in-service deputation to Post-graduate studies. The\n\noperative portion of the order reads as follows:\n\n\"GOVERNMENT ORDER NO.HFW 342 HSH 2008,\nBASNGALORE, DATED: 29.1.2010\n\nIn the background of the circumstances\ndetailed in the preamble, it is hereby ordered that\nthe contractual service rendered in the past under\ncontractual appointment by those presently\nworking as General Duty Medical Officers/Dental\nHealth Officers in the Health and Family Welfare\nDepartment be taken into consideration only for in-\nservice deputation to post graduate studies.\nFurther, it is hereby ordered that subject to\ncondition that it would be certified that there was\nno break in service between these two services, the\nservice rendered by some Medical Officers who\nwere appointed under rural weightage quota and\nwho were subsequently continued under\ncontractual basis under rural weightage and under\ncontract basis be taken into consideration while\ndeputing for post graduate studies under in-service\nquota. It is ordered that there is no provision to\nconsider these contractual service and service\nrendered under the rural weightage quota for any\nother service matters.\n\nBy orders and in the name of the\nGovernor of Karnataka\nSd/-\n\n(I. HEMNATH)\nUnder Secretary to Government\nHealth and Family Welfare Department\n(Service-I)\"\n\n14. The other set of Act and Rules, which call for our\n\nconsideration is, the\nKarnataka Educational Institutions\n\n(Prohibition of Capitation Fee) Act, 1984\n(hereinafter referred\n\nto as 'the Prohibition of Capitation Fee Act' for the sake of\n\nbrevity) which regulates admission to educational institutions\n\nimparting education in Medicine and Dental Sciences and to\n\ncurb and prohibit the collection of capitation fee for\n\nadmission to such educational institutions. The said Act was\n\npublished on 09.08.1984 in the Karnataka Gazette\n\nExtraordinary.\nSection 4\nregulates admission to educational\ninstitutions. Section 12 states that the provisions of the Act\n\nhave the effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent in any\n\nother law for the time being in force. Section 14 empowers\n\nthe State Government to make Rules for carrying out all or\n\nany of the purposes of the Act. The Karnataka Conduct of\n\nEntrance Test for Selection and Admission to Post-Graduate\n\nMedical and Dental Degree and Diploma Courses Rules, 2006\n\n(hereinafter referred to as PGET Rules, 2006) have been\n\nenacted under Section 14 of the Prohibition of Captitation Fee\n\nAct.\nSection 2\nis the definition clause. The relevant clauses\n\nread as follows:\n\n\"2. Definitions:- In these rules, unless the context\notherwise requires-\n\n(c) \"Entrance Test\" means the Entrance Test\nreferred to in Rule 3 for selection of candidates for\nadmission to Government Seats in Post-Graduate\nMedical and Dental Degree and Diploma courses;\n\nx x x\n\n(g) \"In-service candidates\" means persons\nbelonging to the Health and Family Welfare\nServices, the Karnataka Medical Education Services\nof the State Civil Services, Employees State\nInsurance (Medical) Services, Mahanagara Palike\nServices, Boards and Corporations Services and\nInstitutions which are granted autonomous status\nincluding the persons deputed from such services to\nany other foreign services;\n\n(h) \"Merit\" means the order of merit determined on\n\nthe basis of marks secured in the Entrance Test;\"\n\nRule 3 deals with Entrance Test, Rule 4 speaks of\n\neligibility, while Rule 10 deals with the procedure for selection\n\nof in-service candidates for admission to Post-graduate\n\nMedical and Dental courses.

By a corrigendum issued on 10.01.2007, sub-rule (2) of\n\nRule 3 has been amended. The corrigendum reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"GOVERNMENT OF KARNATAKA\nNo.HFW 399 MPS 2005 Karnataka Government Secretariat,\nBangalore, dated 10-01-2007\n\nCORIGENDUM\nIn the Government Notification No.HFW 399 MPS 2005,\ndated 08-12-2006 under Rule 3(2) the word \"regular\",\nappearing in the 1st line shall and shall always be deemed to\nhave been deleted and after the word 'service' appearing in\nthe same line, the following words shall be inserted and read\nfurther.\n\n\"in the concerned department including candidates\nappointed under the Rural Weightage Category.\"\n\nBy Order and in the name of the\nGovernor of Karnataka\nSd/-\n\n(MAAZ AHMED SHARIFF)\nJoint Secretary to Government,\nHealth and Family Welfare Department,\n(Medical Education)\"\n\n15. Rule 5A was inserted by notification dated 18.01.2011.\n\nThe said Rule reads as follows:\n\"3. Amendment of Rule 5:- After rule 5 the said\nrules, the following shall be inserted, namely:-\n\n\"5A. Merit list of in-service candidates:- (1)\nNotwithstanding anything contained in these rules,\nwhile preparing the merit list of candidates in\nrespect of in-service candidates working under the\nDirectorate of Health and Family Welfare Services,\nwho has secured minimum qualifying marks, a\nweightage of four marks for each completed year of\nservice beyond five years of service shall be added\nto the marks secured in the Entrance Test subject to\na maximum of thirty marks;\n\nProvided that for each completed year of rural\nservice beyond five years of service, a weightage of\neight marks shall be added to the marks secured in\nthe Entrance Test in lieu of four marks subject to a\nmaximum of thirty marks. No weightage shall be\nadded for the service rendered below five years.\n\nExplanation:- For the purpose of this rule, \"rural\nservice\" means the service rendered in areas other\nthan the areas falling within the limits of municipal\ncorporation, city municipal council, town\nmunicipality, town panchayat established under\nthe\nKarnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976\nor\nthe\nKarnataka Municipalities Act, 1964\nas the case\nmay be and upto such distance from these limits as\nmay be notified by the State Government as urban\narea and includes the service rendered in rural\nareas under the contract period and rural service\nrendered under the rural weightage selection.\n\n(2) The in-service candidates working under the\nDirectorate of Health and Family Welfare Services\nshall not be eligible for Postgraduation or Diploma\ncourses in the disciplines which are not required in\nthe hospitals or institutions coming under the\npurview of the Director of Health and Family\nWelfare Services.\"\n\nThe said Rule was withdrawn by notification dated\n\n07.03.2011. However, the said Rule was revived with effect\n\nfrom 07.04.2011.\n\nRelevant Precedents:\n\n16. At this stage itself, it would be relevant to refer to some\n\nof the decisions of the Apex Court as well as this Court having\n\na bearing on the controversy in issue so that when the\n\ncontentions of the respective parties are epitomized, the\n\nreference to the said precedents could be easily\n\ncomprehended.\n17. In K.Duraiswamy V/s. State of T.N. (2001)2 SCC 538)\n\nthe Apex Court has held that \"classification could be made as\n\n\"service quota\" and \"open quota\", for in-service candidates\n\nand other candidates respectively, confining the respective\n\nclass/cadre candidates to the respective percentages\n\nearmarked for the two of them exclusively.\n\nThe Court further held as follows:\n\n(i) The Government possesses the right and\nauthority to decide from what sources the\nadmissions in educational institutions or to\nparticular disciplines and courses therein have to\nbe made and that too in what proportion;\n\nx x x\n\n(ii) that such exclusive allocation and stipulation of\na definite quota or number of seats between in-\n\nservice and non-service or private candidates\nprovided two separate channels of entry and a\ncandidate belonging to one exclusive quota cannot\nclaim to steal a march into another exclusive quota\nby advancing a claim based on merit. Inter se merit\nof the candidates in each quote shall be determined\nbased on the merit performance of the candidates\nbelonging to that quota;\"\n\n18. In the case of State of M.P. -V/s- Gopal D.Tirthani\n\n(2003)7 SCC 83) (Gopal Thirthani) the Apex Court ruled on\n\nthe significance of the eligibility test and held as follows:\n\n\"25. The eligibility test, called the entrance test or\nthe Pre-PG test, is conducted with dual purposes.\nFirstly, it is held with the object of assessing the\nknowledge and intelligence quotient of a candidate\nwhether he would be able to prosecute post-\ngraduate studies if allowed an opportunity of doing\nso; secondly, it is for the purpose of assessing the\nmerit inter se of the candidates which is of vital\nsignificance at the counselling when it comes to\nallotting the successful candidates to different\ndisciplines wherein the seats are limited and some\ndisciplines are considered to be more creamy and\nare more coveted than the others.\n\n26. The Medical Council of India, for the present,\ninsists, through its Regulations, on a common\nEntrance Test being conducted whereat the\nminimum qualifying marks would be 50%.\"\n19. As to whether weightage could be given to doctors for\n\ntheir having rendered specified number of years of service in\n\nrural or tribal areas, it has been observed that in-service\n\ndoctors had been told in advance and knowing that by\n\nrendering service in rural/tribal areas, they can capture\n\nbetter prospects of earning higher professional qualifications\n\nand consequently eligibility for promotion, acts as a\n\nmotivating factor and provides incentive to young in-service\n\ndoctors to opt for service in rural/tribal areas. Therefore,\n\nassigning weightage to rural service rendered as Assistant\n\nSurgeons and carving out a classification in favour of women\n\ncandidates conferring them with eligibility for seeking\n\nadmission in post-graduate courses by rendering three years'\n\nconsecutive service in rural areas satisfy the twin tests of\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. Thus, the Apex Court held that\n\nit is permissible to assign a reasonable weightage to services\n\nrendered in rural/tribal areas by the in-service candidates for\n\nthe purpose of determining interse merit within the class of\n\nin-service candidates who have qualified in the pre-PG test by\n\nsecuring the minimum qualifying marks as prescribed by the\n\nMedical Council of India.\n20. With regard to the academic year 2008-09, certain in-\n\nservice candidates in the State (Dr. Ranganath and others)\n\nquestioned the action of the State in not allowing them to\n\nappear for counseling as per a single merit list, in terms of\n\nRule 2(h) of the PGET Rules 2006 in W.P.Nos.9397-\n\n9399/2009. By an order dated 08.04.2009 issued by the\n\nState Government, three separate merit lists were prepared\n\nbased on the length of service of the in-service candidates i.e.,\n\npreference to be given to the first slab (i.e., those who had\n\ncompleted five years of regular service), then to the second\n\nslab (i.e., those who had completed four years of service) and\n\nthen to the third slab (i.e., those who had completed three\n\nyears of service). The said order was issued by the State\n\nGovernment on 08.04.2009 purportedly under Rule 61(1)(a)\n\nread with Appendix-II-A of the KCSR. A learned Single Judge\n\nof this court by order dated 27.07.2009 sought to\n\nharmoniously interpret Rule 61 read with Appendix II-A of the\n\nKCSR and PGET Rules, 2006 and held as follows:\n\n\"8. As aforementioned, in these matters, Rules of\n2006 and Rule 61 r/w. Appendix II-A of the KCSRs\noperate simultaneously in such matters. Therefore,\nthey will have to be harmoniously construed. One\ncannot be ignored in preference to the other. The\nobject of the State appears to give preference to the\nseniors in service who have passed the Common\nEntrance Test examination along with the juniors.\nBy this process, juniors will also not get effected,\ninasmuch as, they may get seat under in-service\nquota in the coming years. Such a procedure will\nnot violate the principles of law laid down by the\nApex Court in the case of State of Machya Pradesh -\nVs- Gopal D.Thirthani (cited supra), inasmuch as,\nthe seniors in-service also will have to get through\nthe entrance examination for getting the Post-\ngraduate seat.\n\n9. In view of the above, this court does not find any\nerror in the Government Order dated 8.4.2009\ngiving preference to the candidates who have\ncompleted 5 years of service in the department. As\naforementioned, Rules of 2006 will have to be read\nharmoniously with Rule 61(1) r/w. Appendix II-A of\nthe KCSRs. Accordingly, the State Government is\njustified in issuing the Government Order dated\n8.4.2009.\n10. In the matter on hand, however, the petitioners\nare selected and are already admitted to the Post-\ngraduation courses as in-service candidates by\nvirtue of the interim order granted by this Court.\nThey are continuing their course of study. It is also\nbrought to the notice of the court by learned counsel\nfor the petitioners that the petitioners herein have\nalso completed 5 years of service in the department\nby now. Respondents 6 to 17 are also admitted to\nPost-graduation course as in-service candidates. In\nview of the above, this court does not propose to\ndisturb the academic career of the petitioners as\nwell as respondents 6 to 17, more so, when the\nperiod prescribed for counseling is already over.\nAccordingly, the following order is made:\n\nThe prayers as sought for in the writ petitions\ncannot be granted.\n\nThe Government Order dated 8.4.2009 bearing\nNo.Aakuka 86 HSH 2009, is declared valid.\nHowever, the petitioners who are already selected\nand admitted to the Post-graduation course shall\nnot be disturbed in view of the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of this case.\nWrit petitions are accordingly dismissed with the\nsaid observations.\"\n\n21. As far as the academic year 2011-2012 is concerned,\n\nW.P.No.15539/2011 was filed assailing the provisional merit\n\nlist, whereby, according to the petitioners therein, 34\n\ncandidates who were working on contract basis and whose\n\nservices were absorbed under the Absorption Rules, 2006 and\n\nAbsorption Rules 2007 and who had not completed six years\n\nof regular service and were, therefore, ineligible to apply for\n\nPGET-2011 under in-service quota had found a place in the\n\nprovisional merit list. By an interim order dated 01.05.2011,\n\na learned Single Judge held that the 34 candidates who had\n\nbeen absorbed under the aforesaid two Rules had not\n\ncompleted six years from the date of their Absorption and\n\nprima facie, were ineligible to apply for PGET-2011 under in-\n\nservice quota. Rejecting the contention of the private\n\nrespondents therein, the learned Single Judge further\n\nobserved as follows:\n\n\"It is clear that the aforesaid 34 candidates, who\nare absorbed under the aforesaid two Rules had\nnot completed six years from the date of their\nabsorption. Therefore, prima facie, I am of the view\nthat they were ineligible to apply for PGET-2011\nunder in-service quota. There is no merit in the\ncontention of the private respondents that there is\nno bar for them to appear for the examination and\nthe only bar is for deputing them for higher studies.\n\nThe very object of appearing in the PGET\nexamination, 2011 and counseling them is to\ndepute them for higher studies. There is no point in\nselecting them and not deputing them for higher\nstudies. Therefore, inclusion of respondent Nos.5 to\n36 in the final list of in-service candidates for PG\nDegree/Diploma selection for the year 2011\npublished by the respondents vide Annexure J is\ncontrary to law. Their names should not have been\ncleared by the third respondent for their\nappearance in the PGET-2011 examination until\nthey complete six years of service from the date of\nabsorption.\"\n\n22. Accordingly, a direction was given to the respondent-\n\nauthorities to re-do the final merit list of in-service candidates\n\nby omitting the 34 ineligible candidates. The said order was\n\nassailed in W.A.Nos.4457-4461/2011 and connected matters.\n\nBy order dated 07.06.2011, the writ appeals were dismissed.\nSpecial Leave Petitions were filed against the order of the\n\nDivision Bench. Initially the Apex Court by order dated\n\n22.06.2011 issued an order of status quo, but by order dated\n\n01.08.2011, the same was vacated and a direction was also\n\ngiven to give effect to the order of the High Court subject to\n\nfinal decision in the Special Leave Petition which we are told\n\nis pending.\n\n23. What is significant as far as the academic year 2012-13\n\nis concerned is the controversy with regard to the amendment\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules, 2006, 2007 and 2009, whereby\n\nthere is a omission of the embargo with regard to prosecuting\n\nPost-graduate studies for a period of six years after the date\n\nof absorption. Therefore, one of the considerations that\n\nwould have to be made is as to the binding effect of the orders\n\ndated 07.06.2011 of the Division Bench of this Court\n\naffirming the interim order of the learned Single Judge dated\n\n01.05.2011.\n\n24. One other aspect that has to be stated at this stage\n\nitself is that the appellants in W.A.Nos.3004-3018/2012,\nexcept appellant Nos. 12 and 14, were appointed by way of\n\ndirect recruitment in the years 1997, 2000, 2002 and 2004.\n\nAppellant Nos.12 and 14 were appointed under the\n\nAbsorption Rules, 2003. They have placed reliance on\n\nnotification dated 18.12.2007, 08.02.2008 and 09.01.2009\n\nwhereby certain doctors were appointed by direct recruitment\n\nwith a condition that every candidate so appointed had to\n\ncompulsorily serve atleast for six years in rural areas.\n\n25. That apart, by government Order dated 29.012010, it\n\nwas ordered that the contractual service rendered in the past\n\nunder contractual appointment by those doctors working\n\nunder the Department of Health and Family Welfare be taken\n\ninto consideration only for in-service candidates to Post-\n\ngraduate studies. The contractual service was not to be\n\nconsidered for any other service condition. The said\n\nGovernment Order was questioned by certain doctors in\n\nW.P.Nos.8544-8550/2010 and connected matters, which\n\nwere dismissed by order dated 26.04.2010.\n26. Against the aforesaid order, W.A.Nos.1922-1923/2010\n\nand connected matters were filed. A Division Bench of this\n\ncourt, by order dated 31.05.2010 allowed the appeals in part.\n\nAgainst the said order, Special Leave Petitions were filed\n\nbefore the Apex Court which initially passed an order\n\n21.06.2010, stating that the admission list shall not be\n\nfinalised until the next date of hearing. Thereafter, by order\n\ndated 28.06.2010, the operation of the order of the Division\n\nBench was stayed until further orders. The Special Leave\n\nPetitions are pending adjudication before the Apex Court.\n\n27. The recent order of the Apex Court in the case of Priya\n\nGupta -V/s- State of Chattisgarh, dated 08.05.2012\n\n(C.A.No.4318/2012) has also been brought to our notice with\n\nregard to compliance of admissions in terms of the prescribed\n\ntime schedule. In the said decision, the Apex Court has\n\nobserved that the High Court should ensure strict adherence\n\nto the prescribed time schedule, process of selection and to\n\nthe rule on merit. Further, that the High Court may, except\n\nin exceptional cases, should consider it appropriate to decline\n\ninterim orders and hear the main petitions finally subject to\nthe convenience of the court.\n\nContentions and submissions:\n\n28. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n29. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants in\n\nWrit Appeal Nos.2978-86/2012 & 2987-96/2012 contended\n\nthat these appellants were not parties to the writ petitions.\n\nHowever, they are aggrieved by the order of the learned Single\n\nJudge in holding that the PGET Rules 2006 prevail over the\n\nDeputation Rules made under the KCSR, thereby permitting\n\nthose in-service doctors who are regularised in the year 2007\n\nas well as 2009 to be considered for admission to Post-\n\ngraduate Courses. That these appellants were absorbed\n\nunder the Absorption Rules of 2006. In view of the\n\namendments made to the Absorption Rules of 2006, 2007\n\nand 2009, the in-service doctors are governed by the KCSR\n\npertaining to deputation. Therefore, the in-service doctors\n\nwho were absorbed in the year 2007 and 2009 were not\n\neligible to take the Entrance Test under the PGET Rules 2006\n\nas they have not completed five years of regular service.\nSimilarly, the directly recruited in-service doctors who have\n\nnot completed five years of regular service were not entitled to\n\ntake the Entrance Test. That Rule 61 read with Appendix-IIA\n\nof the KCSR pertain to regulating deputation of or grant of\n\nstudy leave to Government Servants for prosecution of special\n\ncourse of study consisting of special study or specialised\n\ntraining within India. The said Rules have the force of the\n\nAct, having regard to\nSection 3(1)(b)\nread with\nSection 3 (3)(iii)\n\nof the Act, that the said Act prevails over all other laws as it\n\nhas effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in\n\nany other law with respect of matters for which provision is\n\nmade in the Act or for which Rules have been made under the\n\nAct. Therefore, when once the amendments were made by\n\nvirtue of notification dated 21.02.2012, omitting the embargo\n\nplaced on the contract doctors who were regularised under\n\nthe Absorption Rules from being considered for Post-graduate\n\ncourses, the Deputation Rules in terms of the KCSR have\n\ncome into operation.\n\n30. It was emphasised that though the contract doctors\n\nwere absorbed into service, they were regularised by way of\nAbsorption Rules with an embargo that they shall not be\n\neligible for higher studies within a period of six years from the\n\ndate of regularisation. Once the said embargo is omitted in\n\nthe Absorption Rules, by virtue of the amendment notified on\n\n21.02.2012, though with retrospective effect from 30.12.2011,\n\nRule 61 of the KCSR at once became applicable to the\n\ncontract doctors who are absorbed into regular service. Rule\n\n1 to Appendix-IIA to Rule 61 of the KCSR (Deputation Rules)\n\ncategorically states that a person who has not rendered less\n\nthan five years regular service or who is not below 48 years of\n\nage would not be eligible for deputation for higher studies.\n\n31. Therefore, having regard to Rule 61 of KCSR and\n\nkeeping in mind left over seats in in-service quota, the State\n\nGovernment had devised an order of priority on the basis of\n\nthree merit lists based on the number of years of regular\n\nservice completed by in-service doctors. The said order of\n\npriority was upheld by this Court in the case of\n\nDr.N.Ranganath and others. According to these appellants,\n\nthe KCSR are applicable to all in-service doctors and the\n\nPGET Rules 2006 are only procedural in nature and do not\noperate in the field of deputation, which is a condition of\n\nservice. According to the learned Senior Counsel, the PGET\n\nRules 2006 only speak of eligibility for taking the exam.\n\nTherefore, the PGET Rules 2006 cannot over-ride the\n\nprovisions of the Deputation Rules. That infact, as a result of\n\nthe amendment made to the Absorption Rules, there has been\n\nuniformity brought about between the directly recruited and\n\nabsorbed doctors. Moreover, the PGET Rules 2006 are made\n\nunder the Capitation Fee Act, which has nothing to do with\n\nthe deputation or service conditions of the in-service doctors.\n\nTherefore, the PGET Rules 2006 cannot have an over-riding\n\neffect over the Deputation Rules. Reference was also made to\n\nan interim order of the learned Single Judge dated\n\n01.05.2011 in W.P.No.15539/2011 wherein it has been\n\ncategorically held that these in-service doctors who have not\n\ncompleted six years of service from the date of absorption,\n\nwould not be entitled to appear for PGET examination. That\n\nthe said order dated 01.05.2011, has been upheld by a\n\nDivision Bench of this Court and in the Special Leave Petition\n\npreferred against the said order, the Supreme Court has\n\nvacated the earlier order of status-quo granted on\n22.06.2011. Consequently, the order of this court has to be\n\ngiven effect to subject to the final decision in SLP. It was,\n\ntherefore, contended that the learned Single Judge in these\n\ncases was not right in holding that the PGET Rules 2006\n\nprevail over the rules pertaining to deputation with regard to\n\nPost-graduate studies.\n\n32. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants in\n\nW.A.Nos.3020/2012 contended that except appellant Nos.4,\n\n9, 13 and 14, the other appellants are doctors who were\n\nappointed by direct recruitment. During the period 1997 to\n\n2003, the aforesaid four appellants were initially appointed on\n\ncontract basis, but they were subsequently absorbed, but\n\nthere was no condition or an embargo on deputation in their\n\nAbsorption Rules. That pursuant to the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court in Gopal Thirthani's case, PGET Rules 2003\n\nwere framed and later PGET Rules 2006 have been re-framed.\n\nThat as far as the present admissions are concerned, the last\n\ndate for receipt of applications was 31.12.2011. The common\n\nEntrance Test was held on 29.02.2012. That these appellants\n\nare aggrieved by the retrospective operation given to the\namendments made to the Absorption Rules dated 21.02.2012,\n\nwith effect from 31.12.2011. The appellants are also\n\naggrieved by the grant of eight marks as weightage to those\n\ndoctors who have served in the rural areas in terms of Rule\n\n5A of the PGET Rules 2006. That by interim order dated\n\n15.05.2012 granted by this Court, the amendments made to\n\nthe Absorption Rules were stayed. As a consequence, the\n\ndoctors absorbed under the Absorption Rules, 2006 were\n\nincluded in the merit list. But the doctors absorbed in the\n\nsubsequent rules were excluded. As a result, the doctors\n\nabsorbed in the year 2007 and 2009 have challenged the\n\nmerit list. But since the appellants' challenge to the amended\n\nAbsorption Rules has remained ineffective on account of\n\nlearned Single Judge holding that the Absorption Rules\n\ncannot be challenged in a writ petition filed before the High\n\nCourt, but could only be challenged before the Karnataka\n\nAdministrative Tribunal, which has the jurisdiction to deal\n\nwith service matters of Government Servants, the eligibility of\n\nthe batch of absorbed doctors in the year 2007 and 2009 to\n\ntake up the Entrance Test has been recognised by the learned\n\nSingle Judge, contrary to the provisions of Rule 61 read with\nAppendix-IIA of the KCSR. As far as the Writ Petitions filed\n\nby direct recruits are concerned, their exclusion from the\n\nmerit list has been held to be bad in law, since they had also\n\nchallenged the condition in the appointment order that they\n\nshould work for a period of five years in rural areas.\n\n33. On the basis of the above factual matrix, learned Senior\n\nCounsel contended that the retrospective effect given to the\n\namendments made to the Absorption Rules is arbitrary,\n\ncontrary to the spirit of the rules of absorption and\n\nunreasonable and hence, violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. That the amendment made to the\n\nAbsorption Rules takes away the vested rights which have\n\naccrued in favour of the direct recruits and therefore, the said\n\namendments should be struck down or in the alternative at\n\nleast be read down by holding that they do not take away the\n\nright of the direct recruits who are bound by the Deputation\n\nRules (Rule 61 read with Annexure-IIA of the KCSR) for this\n\nacademic year and that they are prospective in nature. That\n\nthe amendment to the Absorption Rules made after the\n\ncommencement of the proceedings of selection for admission\nto the Post-graduate courses has been made in order to\n\nfavour the absorbed doctors and so as to make them eligible\n\nwhen initially under the rules of absorption they were\n\nineligible. That in terms of the Absorption Rules, the\n\nabsorbed doctors became regular employees from the date of\n\nabsorption and an additional condition of absorption was\n\nimposed on the absorbed doctors inasmuch as they were\n\nbarred from proceeding for higher studies during their initial\n\nperiod of service in the rural areas. Also under the terms of\n\nthe Absorption Rules, the previous service of the contract\n\ndoctors cannot be counted for the purpose of seniority. That\n\nthe absorbed doctors accepted these conditions and were\n\nabsorbed into regular service on the basis of the Absorption\n\nRules. That as on the last date fixed for receipt of\n\napplications for taking the Entrance Test for Post-graduation\n\ncourses, the absorbed doctors were ineligible to apply for the\n\nEntrance Test as the notification for making the amendment\n\nto the Absorption Rules had been published only on\n\n21.02.2012. That the object of the retrospective amendment\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules has been, to favour the\n\nabsorbed doctors to the detriment of the directly recruited\ndoctors. It was contended that pursuant to the amendment\n\nmade to Absorption Rules all in-service doctors belong to one\n\nclass, irrespective of whether they are direct recruits or\n\ncontract doctors absorbed into service and thereby\n\nregularised. In respect of both category of doctors, now it is\n\nonly the Deputation Rules made under the KCSR which are\n\napplicable and not the PGET Rules 2006 in the matter of\n\ndeputation of the doctors for Post-graduate courses is\n\nconcerned. Therefore, a vested right, which had accrued to\n\nthe directly recruited doctors owing to their seniority in\n\nservice has been taken away by the amendments made to the\n\nAbsorption Rules particularly, after the last date for\n\nsubmitting the application has lapsed. Therefore, it was\n\npreferred that the retrospective amendment to the Absorption\n\nRules is illegal or at any rate they have to be read down to\n\nhave only a prospective operation and cannot be applied to\n\nthe present admissions.\n\n34. Learned Senior Counsel who has appeared for the\n\nappellants in Writ Appeal Nos.3004-3018/2012 contended\n\nthat the grant of eight marks by way of weightage to\ncandidates who have served beyond five years in the rural\n\nareas on completion of each year of service is unreasonable.\n\nNo doubt, in Gopal Thirthani, the Apex Court has held that\n\nweightage for rural service is permissible, but it should be\n\nreasonable. That proviso to Rule 5A is contrary to the dictum\n\nin Gopal Thirthani. That as far as State of Karnataka is\n\nconcerned, service in rural areas for doctors is not\n\ncompulsory, but is a matter of chance. Therefore, the proviso\n\nto Rule 5A of the PGET Rules 2006 are unreasonable and\n\nlegally invalid.\n\n35. It was also brought to our notice that pursuant to the\n\ndictum in Gopal Thirthani and in terms of\nRegulation 9\nof the\n\nPost-graduate Medical Education Regulation, 2000\n\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the PGME Regulations'), the PGET\n\nRules 2006 were enacted including in-service candidates in\n\nthe State of Karnataka. The said Rules are only procedural in\n\nnature and cannot have an over-riding effect on the\n\nDeputation Rules made under the KCSR. That ultimately,\n\nthere has to be a harmonious interpretation of the KCSR and\n\nPGET Rules 2006 and if that is not possible, then the\nDeputation Rules would apply. Also the doctors who qualify\n\nfor the Post-graduate course are called specialists, whereas it\n\nis only general duty doctors who are posted in rural areas. As\n\na result of the amendment made to the Absorption Rules, the\n\nabsorbed doctors who qualify as Post-graduate doctors would\n\nnot complete their rural service, whereas doctors appointed\n\nby direct recruitment have to put in atleast five years of rural\n\nservice which is an aspect of discrimination against the\n\ndirectly recruited doctors. Learned Senior Counsel, therefore,\n\nsummarised his contentions by saying that as a result of the\n\nweightage given to doctors who have served in the rural areas,\n\nmerit has been redefined, which is contrary to the merit\n\nsecured by the candidates in the Entrance Test. Further, as\n\na result of the amendment made to the Absorption Rules, the\n\ninsistence on rural service for the absorbed doctors has been\n\nnegated.\n\n36. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate\n\nGeneral contended that there are two classes of in-service\n\ndoctors i.e., i) doctors appointed by direct recruitment and ii)\n\ndoctors appointed on contract basis and thereafter absorbed\nunder the respective Absorption Rules. That the Absorption\n\nRules are special rules regularising the services of contract\n\ndoctors. That Rule 3(2) of the Absorption Rules made a\n\ncondition of compulsory rural service for an initial period of\n\nsix years pursuant to absorption, during which period the\n\nabsorbed doctors were not permitted to seek deputation for\n\nhigher studies. However, such an embargo was not placed on\n\nthe directly recruited doctors. In order to remove the\n\ndiscrimination between the two categories of in-service\n\ncandidates that amendments were brought about to the\n\nAbsorption Rules 2006, 2007 and 2009 with retrospective\n\neffect from 30.12.2011. The Draft Rules were published on\n\n30.12.2011 and after inviting objections, the amended rules\n\nwere notified. As a result, the embargo placed on the\n\nabsorbed doctors was removed and discrimination has been\n\neliminated.\n\n37. It was further contended that insofar as Post-graduate\n\ncourses in medical and dental sciences are concerned, it is\n\nthe PGET Rules, 2006 that would apply in the matter of\n\nadmission to such courses. That the Deputation Rules (Rule\n61 read with Appendix-IIA of the KCSR) which are general\n\nrules applicable to all Government Servants, but as far as\n\nPost-Graduate medical and dental courses are concerned, it\n\nis only the PGET Rules, 2006 which are applicable. These\n\nRules are framed pursuant to the direction of the Medical\n\ncouncil of India as well as keeping in mind the Supreme\n\nCourt dicta in various judgments for determining merit.\n\nTherefore, the general rules for deputation framed under the\n\nKCSR would have to be yield to the special rules in the matter\n\nof admission to Post-graduate medical and dental courses.\n\nThat Rule 2(g) of the PGET Rules, 2006 defines in-service\n\ncandidates and in terms of the said definition doctors in\n\nGovernment service who are appointed by direct recruitment\n\nor regularised under the Absorption Rules are treated at par\n\nas there can be no discrimination between the doctors\n\nappointed from the said two sources once the contract\n\ndoctors are regularised by the State Government. Therefore,\n\nit was contended that where admission to Post-graduate\n\nmedical or dental courses are concerned under the PGET\n\nRules, 2006 the KCSR are not applicable. On the other hand,\n\nthe PGET Rules 2006 are equally applicable to both directly\nrecruited doctors as well as absorbed doctors. The\n\namendments made to the 2006, 2007 and 2009 Rules is with\n\nthe object to bring it in consonance with the PGET Rules\n\n2006. It is under those circumstances, the amendments have\n\nbeen made to Rule 3(2) of the Absorption Rules giving it a\n\nretrospective effect so that the Rules could be applicable for\n\nthe admission made in the current academic year. There is\n\nno malafides alleged against the State Government as no\n\nparticular group of doctors have been favoured. On the other\n\nhand, to remove discrimination within the in-service\n\ncandidates, the amendments were made to the rules of\n\nabsorption. The directly recruited doctors have no vested\n\nright to seek admission to the Post-graduate courses, except\n\nby way of merit obtained in the Entrance Test. The directly\n\nrecruited doctors cannot, therefore, challenge the amendment\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules. The object and purpose of the\n\namendment is to bring about a level playing field between the\n\ndoctors, so that merit is the foremost consideration for\n\nadmission to Post-graduate courses subject to fulfilling other\n\nconditions in the PGET Rules of 2006.\n38. It was also contended that there is no substance in the\n\nchallenge made to the Amendment Rules as the said\n\namendments do not violate the Fundamental Rights of the\n\npetitioner nor its parent Act. Learned Addl. Advocate General,\n\ntherefore, contended that merit being the most important\n\ncriterion for admission to Post-graduate medical and dental\n\ncourses, PGET Rules 2006 would be applicable and they have\n\nan over-riding effect on any other Rules concerning\n\ndeputation. He also justified the amendment made to Rule\n\n5A of the PGET Rules 2006 with effect from 18.01.2011,\n\nwhich is in consonance with the judgment of the Supreme\n\nCourt in Gopal Thirthani and that the challenge made to the\n\nsaid Rules is without any merit, as the directly recruited\n\ndoctors are eligible for such a weightage as also the absorbed\n\ndoctors.\n\n39. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents\n\nin W.A.Nos.2978-2986/2012 and connected matters at the\n\noutset stated that the challenge made to the amendment of\n\nthe Absorption Rules is without substance. That these\n\nrespondents have the merit and are eligible to be admitted for\nthe Post-graduate courses. On the other hand, those who are\n\nless meritorious have challenged the Amendment Rules. That\n\nin the petitions filed by certain other doctors, there was an\n\ninterim order of stay granted to the Amendment Rules on\n\n15.05.2012. As a consequence, the State Government\n\nprepared a fresh merit list excluding these respondents by\n\nissuance of Circular dated 16.05.2012. Therefore, the latter\n\nwere constrained to file writ petitions seeking their inclusion\n\nin the merit list having regard to their eligibility under the\n\nPGET Rules 2006. It was also explained that the State\n\nGovernment had not appointed any doctor since the year\n\n1999 by way of direct recruitment. On the other hand,\n\ndoctors were appointed on contract basis and since these\n\ndoctors had served for considerably long time and they had\n\nsought for regularisation of their services, the Absorption\n\nRules of 2006, 2007 and 2009 were framed. However,\n\nAbsorption Rules had an additional condition inasmuch as in\n\ntheir initial period of service after absorption, the doctors had\n\nto work in rural areas for a period of six years and during the\n\nsaid period they were not eligible for deputation for higher\n\nstudies. The State Government felt that such a condition\nwould be to the disadvantage of the absorbed doctors having\n\nregard to the fact that they have served for long number of\n\nyears and therefore, the said embargo was omitted pursuant\n\nto the amendments made to the said rules of absorption.\n\nThat the amendment to the Absorption Rules are made\n\npursuant to Rule 8 of the Act which enables a rule having a\n\nretrospective effect and therefore, the amendment of the\n\nAbsorption Rules has not in any way affected the admission\n\nprocess for the current academic year since the Amendment\n\nRules are effective from 30.12.2011, whereas the last date for\n\nfiling of applications for the admission of Post-graduate was\n\n31.12.2011.\n\n40. It was also pointed out that Rule 5 of the Absorption\n\nRules have an over-riding effect as they are special rules of\n\nappointment and therefore, the Rules of Deputation made\n\nunder Rule 61 of the KCSR read with Appendix-IIA do not\n\napply to the absorbed doctors. It was also contended that the\n\nappellants had participated in the admission process and\n\nthey are estopped from challenging the criterion for selection.\n\nIt was also contended that the challenge to the Absorption\nRules could only be made before the Karnataka\n\nAdministrative Tribunal and not before the High Court. It\n\nwas further contended that the PGET Rules 2006 are special\n\nrules for admission for medical and dental courses and they\n\nhave an over-riding effect on Deputation Rules enacted under\n\nthe Act.\n\n41. The respondents in W.A.Nos.3004-3018/2012 and\n\n3020-3034/2012 through their counsel contended that the\n\nGovernment Order dated 29.01.2010 specifically recognises\n\nthat the period of contract service must be recognised for the\n\npurpose of deputation. Therefore, even if it is held that PGET\n\nRules 2006 do not over-ride the Deputation Rules made\n\nunder the KCSR, having regard to the Government Order\n\ndated 29.01.2010, the contract doctors were absorbed into\n\nservice are eligible to be deputed for higher studies. It was\n\nalso contended that the appellants cannot challenge the grant\n\nof weightage under Rule 5A of the PGET Rules 2006 as they\n\nare also beneficiaries of the weightage of marks given to them\n\nand therefore, having participated in the admission process,\n\nthey are estopped from challenging the same.\n42. Learned counsel for the private respondents stated that\n\nlearned Single Judge by interim order dated 15.05.2012\n\nenabled the State Government to alter the merit list mid-way\n\npursuant to the interim order of stay granted by this Court in\n\nMay, 2012. This has led to these doctors file writ petitions.\n\n43. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for respondent\n\nNos.7, 8 and 16,in W.A.Nos.3004-18/2012 at the outset\n\nstated that the appellants cannot maintain a challenge to the\n\namendment made to the Absorption Rules as the Karnataka\n\nAdministrative Tribunal is the forum to challenge a service\n\nrule. That the learned Single Judge was right in holding that\n\nthe contract doctors absorbed under the Absorption Rules of\n\n2006 have the right to be deputed for Post-graduate courses.\n\nAssuming for the sake of argument that Rule 61 of the KCSR\n\nis applicable, the eligibility for deputation is to be considered\n\nafter the merit list is published under the PGET Rules 2006\n\nand that in the instant case the doctors absorbed under the\n\nRules 2006 have the eligibility to be admitted to the Post-\n\ngraduate courses. Therefore, the contention of some of the\nappellants that the respondent-doctors had no eligibility even\n\nto take the Entrance Test is incorrect as they had not\n\ncompleted five years of regular service as required under the\n\nDeputation Rules. It was also contended that the weightage\n\nunder Rule 5A has to be given having regard to the period of\n\ncontract service rendered by the absorbed doctors and the\n\nsaid Rule cannot be held to be unreasonable or arbitrary\n\nsince it is made in consonance with the dictum of the\n\nSupreme Court and that only thirty marks maximum could\n\nbe awarded. Concluding the said contentions, learned Senior\n\nCounsel stated that the doctors absorbed under the\n\nAbsorption Rules 2006, were eligible to be admitted for Post-\n\ngraduate medical courses on the basis of their merit. It was\n\nalso pointed out that after absorption of the contract doctors,\n\na common seniority list is prepared and all the doctors\n\nappointed by direct recruitment or by regularisation form one\n\nclass and that there can be no discrimination within the said\n\nclass of doctors. That the doctors appointed under direct\n\nrecruitment have no vested rights vis-à-vis the absorbed\n\ndoctors and they have no reason to challenge the amendment\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules.\n44. Learned Senior Counsel also placed reliance on the\n\ndecisions of the Apex Court in Mridhul Dhar -V/s- Union of\n\nIndia (2005) 2 SCC 65) and two other decisions and it was\n\nsubmitted that merit list prepared by the State Government\n\ncannot be altered at this point of time since 31st May was the\n\nlast date for closing the admissions and therefore, the learned\n\nSingle Judge was not right in ordering re-counseling.\n\n45. By way of reply, learned Senior Counsel for the\n\nappellants submitted that the doctors regularised under the\n\nAbsorption Rules 2006 have not questioned the amendment\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules, they have also accepted the\n\ninsertion of Rule 5A to the PGET Rules 2006. Their only plea\n\nultimately is that the Deputation Rules framed under the\n\nKCSR would prevail over the PGET Rules 2006 since the\n\nadmission to Post-graduate courses is by way of deputation\n\nfor higher studies. Therefore, the Rules made under the Act\n\nhave an over-riding effect over all other laws and that the\n\nPGET Rules 2006, which are made under the Capitation Fee\n\nAct cannot over-ride the KCSR having regard to Section 12 of\nthe Capitation Fee Act and\nSection 14\nof the Act. Moreover,\n\naccording to the appellants, these two rules operate in\n\ndifferent fields. It was also clarified that the Deputation Rules\n\nis not a piece of subordinate legislation, but it is a part of the\n\nKarnataka Civil Services Act, whereas the PGET Rules 2006\n\nare delegated legislation, which cannot have an over-riding\n\neffect on the Act.\n\n46. It was also reiterated that when once the amendment\n\nwas made to the Absorption Rules by omitting the embargo\n\nunder Rule 3(2) of the Rules, then the Deputation Rules made\n\nunder the KCSR was at once applicable to all in-service\n\ndoctors en bloc. It was also clarified that the appellants have\n\nnot questioned the participation of the doctors in the\n\nadmission process, but their contention is with regard to the\n\neligibility for sending the doctors for deputation when they\n\nhave not fulfilled the conditions of Rule 61 of the KCSR. It\n\nwas stated that the doctors absorbed under the Absorption\n\nRules 2006 are eligible to be deputed for Post-graduate\n\nCourse and therefore, the learned Single Judge was not right\n\nin ordering re-counseling of in-service candidates by taking\ninto consideration those doctors who were absorbed under\n\nthe 2007 and 2009 Rules also.\n\n47. It was also contended by another Senior Counsel that\n\nwhen once the contract doctors are absorbed into service,\n\nthey are lowest in the seniority list. There are certain terms\n\nand conditions, subject to which, absorption has been made\n\nand the conditions for absorption cannot be taken away with\n\nretrospective effect. That the State Government has doubly\n\nfavoured the contract doctors inasmuch as the embargo\n\nplaced in the Absorption Rules have been omitted with\n\nretrospective effect and also, weightage of marks to the\n\ncontract doctors is also permissible having regard to their\n\nservice rendered as contract doctors.\n\n48. Learned counsel on both sides have relied upon certain\n\ndecisions in support of their respective contentions which\n\nshall be referred to, during the course of this judgment.\nPoint for consideration:\n\n49. Having regard to the legal matrix and the varied\n\nsubmissions of the learned Senior Counsel and counsel on\n\nboth sides, the point that arises for our consideration is:\n\n\"Whether the learned Single Judge was right in\nordering maintenance of status quo in respect of the\ncounseling which had already taken place prior to\nthe grant of interim orders by this court and\ndirecting the completion of the counseling process\nfor admission to Post-graduate Medical Courses\nfrom the in-service category of doctors in terms of\nthe merit list prepared prior to the interim order\ngranted by this court?\"\n\nAnalysis of Relevant Acts and Rules:\n\n50.\nThe Karnataka State Civil Service Act, 1978\nis an Act to\n\nregulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of\n\npersons appointed to Civil Service in the State of Karnataka\n\nand posts in connection with the affairs of the State of\n\nKarnataka. Clause (b) of sub-section (1) of\nSection 3\nspeaks\n\nabout the regulation of recruitment and conditions of service\n\nof persons appointed to public services by way of Rules.\nClause (iii) of sub-section (3) of\nSection 3\nstates that all rules\n\nrelating to matters referred to in sub-section (1) and in force\n\non the date of commencement of the Act made by the\n\nGovernor under the proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution\n\nof India, regulating the recruitment and conditions of service\n\nof persons appointed to civil services and posts in connection\n\nwith the affairs of the State shall be deemed to be rules made\n\nunder sub-section (1) and shall continue in force until they\n\nare modified or replaced by rules made under this Act. The\n\nsaid Act received the assent of the President on the\n\n12.07.1985 but came into force only on 30.05.1990. Rule 6\n\nstates that the Act and any rule made or deemed to have been\n\nmade thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything\n\ninconsistent therewith contained in any other law with\n\nrespect to matters for which provision is made in this Act or\n\nfor which rules can be made under the Act. Sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 8\nstates that any rule made under this Act may be\n\nmade with retrospective effect and when such a rule is made,\n\nthe reasons for making the rule would have to be specified in\n\na statement to be laid before both Houses of the State\n\nLegislature and subject to any modification made under sub-\nsection (3), every rule made under the Act has the effect as if\n\nit is enacted in the Act. Owing to the aforesaid deeming\n\nprovisions Rule 61 of the Karnataka Civil Service Rule, 1958\n\nread with Appendix-IIA which deals with deputation of or\n\ngrant of study leave to Government servants for prosecution\n\nof special course of study consisting of higher studies or\n\nspecialised training within India are part and parcel of the\n\nAct. Under the said Rule and Appendix, the Government may\n\ndepute a Government servant for higher studies or specialised\n\ntraining in a professional or technical subject having a direct\n\nand close connection with the sphere of his duty at a\n\nrecognised institution within the State or outside the State\n\nbut within India, if he or she has completed five years of\n\nregular service and is below 48 years of age. The number of\n\nGovernment servants to be deputed at any point of time for\n\nhigher studies or specialised training has to be kept at a\n\nminimum, not exceeding 5% of the sanctioned permanent\n\nstrength of the concerned cadre. The selection of a candidate\n\nfor higher studies or specialised training has to be made\n\nstrictly on the basis of seniority except for reasons to be\n\nrecorded in writing.\n51.\nThe Karnataka Educational Institutions (Prohibition of\n\nCapitation Fee) Act, 1984\n(hereinafter referred to as\n\n'Capitation Fee Act') has been enacted to curb the evil practice\n\nof collection of capitation fee for admission to educational\n\ninstitutions in the State of Karnataka and to regulate certain\n\nmatters relating there to. The said Act received the assent of\n\nthe President on the 20.07.1984.\nSection 4\nof the said Act\n\ndeals with regulation of admission to educational institutions,\n\non the basis of general or special orders, as may be made by\n\nthe Government in this behalf and any other law for the time\n\nbeing in force, with regard to the minimum qualification for\n\nadmission to any course of study in an educational\n\ninstitution, which as may be specified by the university\n\nconcerned where the educational institution is maintained by\n\nor affiliated to such university or by the Government in the\n\ncase of other courses of study in any other educational\n\ninstitution. It also regulates the maximum number of\n\nstudents that could be admitted to the course of study in an\n\neducational institution, which may be fixed by the\n\nGovernment from time to time.\nSection 5\nregulates tuition fee\nor any other fee or deposit or other amount that may be\n\nreceived or collected by any educational institution or class of\n\nsuch institutions in respect of any or all class or classes of\n\nstudents. Section 12 states that the provisions of the\n\nCapitation Fee Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything\n\ninconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time\n\nbeing in force. Section 14 enables the State Government to\n\nmake rules for the purpose of carrying out the purposes of\n\nthe Act.\n\n5522..

Rule 4 speaks of eligibility to appear for the Entrance\n\nTest, which is a general provision. The eligibility criteria for\n\nappearance in the Entrance Test are as follows:\n(a) a candidate must be a citizen of India:\n\n(b) he or she must have studied and passed in the\ncourses leading to the award of MBBS/BDS\nDegree in Colleges recognised by Medical\nCouncil of India/Dental Council of India,\nGovernment of India established by law and\nlocated in Karnataka State; or\n\n(c) candidate must be of Karnataka origin who has\nstudied MBBS/BDS degrees in colleges outside\nKarnataka recognised by Medical Council of\nIndia/Dental Council of India and Government\nof India and affiliated to any University\nestablished by law in India.\n\nThe Explanation deals with \"candidate of Karnataka\n\nOrigin\".\n\n54.

The said Rule prescribes the following\n\nconditions for admission:\n\n(1) (a) that the in-service candidate has to have\natleast three years of regular service:\n(b)he has satisfactorily completed the\nprescribed period of probation;\n\n(2) that an in-service candidate shall not be eligible\nfor admission in any subject other than the\nspeciality in which he is working;\n\n(3) that an in-service candidate who is already\nholding a Post-graduate degree in any speciality\nshall not be eligible for admission to any other Post-\n\ngraduate degree or Diploma;\n\n(4) that an in-service candidate who is already\nholding a Post-graduate Diploma in any speciality,\nthrough Government deputation, shall be eligible for\nadmission to Post-graduate degree courses in the\nsame speciality and shall not be eligible for any\nother Post-graduate degree or Diploma courses;\n\n(5) an in-service candidate who is studying in\nany Post-graduate degree or Diploma Course shall\nnot be eligible for admission under these rules;\n\n(6) a candidate who is above forty-eight years of\nage as on the last date fixed for receipt of\napplication shall not be eligible for admission.\nAnswer to the point for consideration:\n\n55. The controversy in these cases is with regard to the\n\neligibility of certain in-service candidates for Post-graduate\n\ncourses, be it degree or Diploma courses. Of course, the\n\nstudy of the Post-graduate course is by way of deputation\n\ninsofar as the in-service candidates are concerned. However,\n\nthe conundrum is, as to whether in the matter of deputation\n\nfor these courses, the Rules of Deputation made under the\n\nKCSR would apply or the admission to the said courses would\n\nbe on the basis of the PGET Rules, 2006. The Rules of\n\nDeputation are made under the KCSR and have to be read as\n\npart and parcel of the Karnataka Civil Services Act, but the\n\nPGET Rules, 2006 are made under the provisions of the\n\nCapitation Fee Act and it specifically deals with admission for\n\nthe Post-graduate Courses. Therefore, the moot point for our\n\nconsideration is, as to whether the Deputation Rules made\n\nunder the KCSR as well as the PGET Rules 2006 made under\n\nthe Capitation Fee Act have to be harmoniously read for the\n\npurpose of admission of in-service candidates to Post-\n\ngraduate Medical and Dental Courses or it is either of the\n\nsaid Rules which would have an over-riding effect on the\nother and therefore, compliance with only one set of Rules is\n\nrequired for admission to Post-graduate courses.\n\n56. We have extracted and analysed the respective Rules\n\nhaving regard to the object for which they have been enacted\n\nas well as the conditions prescribed therein. If for the sake of\n\nargument it is assumed that it is Rule 61 read with Appendix-\n\nIIA of the KCSR (Deputation Rules), which are the only Rules\n\napplicable for deputation of an in-service candidate for Post-\n\ngraduate studies, then the question would be as to whether\n\nthe eligibility criteria prescribed under the PGET Rules 2006\n\nwould have to be given a go-by. It is noted that there are\n\nmore number of criteria prescribed under the PGET Rules,\n\n2006 at the stage of application for an Entrance Test,\n\neligibility to appear for an Entrance Test and for admission to\n\na Post-graduate course that is, at three stages. On the other\n\nhand, the Deputation Rule framed under Rule 61 of the KCSR\n\nis a general rule concerning deputation of all Government\n\nservants for higher studies or other training based on\n\nseniority, except for the reasons to be recorded in writing.\n\nUnder the said Rules of Deputation, a Government servant is\nnot required to apply for or appear for an Entrance Test.\n\nUnder the said Rules, the selection of a candidate for higher\n\nstudies or specialised training is made strictly on the basis of\n\nseniority and the number of Government servants to be\n\ndeputed at any point of time for higher studies or specialised\n\ntraining has to be at a minimum, not exceeding 5% of the\n\nsanctioned permanent strength of the concerned cadre.\n\nWhereas under the PGET Rules, 2006 specific conditions are\n\nprescribed for application to an Entrance Test, eligibility to\n\ntake the Entrance Test and for admission to a Post-graduate\n\ncourse. The varied conditions which have been listed supra\n\nare conspicuous by their absence in the Deputation Rules for\n\nhigher studies under the KCSR. In other words, even if a\n\nGovernment servant fulfills the conditions prescribed under\n\nRule 61 read with Appendix-IIA of the Deputation Rules, he or\n\nshe would not be eligible for admission to a Post-graduate\n\ncourse unless and until he/she fulfills the eligibility criteria\n\never for the application for the Entrance Test, eligibility to\n\ntake Entrance Test as well as the admission for the Post-\n\ngraduate Courses. One cannot lose sight of the fact that we\n\nare concerned with deputation for Post-graduate course in\nMedical/Dental Course and not any other course. Therefore,\n\nthe eligibility criteria prescribed under the PGET Rules 2006\n\nnecessarily have to be fulfilled by an in-service candidate\n\nirrespective of whether such a candidate has fulfilled the\n\nconditions prescribed under Rule 61 of the KCSR read with\n\nAppendix-IIA.\n\n57. The bone of contention in these cases, however, is with\n\nregard to the completion of the requisite number of years of\n\nservice for being deputed for higher studies. Under the\n\nDeputation Rules, it is five years of regular service. However,\n\nunder the PGET Rules 2006 for the purpose of application for\n\nthe entrance test, it is only three years of service. Whereas,\n\nwhen it comes to the stage of admission to Post-graduate\n\nCourses, it is three years of regular service. In addition, an\n\nin-service candidate would have to complete the prescribed\n\nperiod of probation. Such a condition is also necessary at the\n\ntime of making the application. But under Rule 61 of KCSR\n\nall that is stated is five years of regular service, the\n\nrequirement of completion of probation is not necessary.\n\nSimilarly, under Rule 10 there are other conditions which\nhave to be fulfilled by an in-service candidate before he/she is\n\nadmitted to a Post-graduate course, the same are stated\n\nsupra. Two significant conditions can be mentioned at this\n\nstage. One is that, an in-service candidate who is already\n\nholding a Post-graduate Diploma in any speciality, through\n\nGovernment deputation, would be eligible for admission to\n\nPost-graduate degree courses in the same speciality and\n\nsecondly, any in-service candidate who is already holding a\n\nPost-graduate degree in any speciality shall not be eligible for\n\nany other Post-graduate degree or Diploma courses. This can\n\nonly mean that if a candidate has secured a Diploma in any\n\nspeciality on the basis of the deputation made by the\n\nGovernment, then he shall be eligible for Post-graduate\n\ndegree course in the same speciality, but would not be eligible\n\nfor any other Post-graduate degree or Diploma in other\n\nspeciality. In other words, an in-service candidate can obtain\n\na Diploma or a degree in the same speciality, but not in any\n\nother speciality. That apart, a candidate who is above 48\n\nyears of age on the last date fixed for receipt of application is\n\nineligible for admission. Therefore, the conditions prescribed\n\nunder the PGET Rules, 2006 are more rigorous at every stage\nof selection and admission and have to be satisfied by an in-\n\nservice candidate before he/she is admitted to a Post-\n\ngraduate degree/diploma course despite being qualified under\n\nthe Deputation Rules.\n\n58. The specific controversy, however, is with regard to the\n\ncondition prescribed in the PGET Rules 2006 that an in-\n\nservice candidate who has put in three years of service as on\n\nthe last date of receipt of application is eligible to apply for the\n\nEntrance Test whereas the condition under Rule 61 of the\n\nKCSR pertaining to deputation of Government servants for\n\nhigher studies it is the completion of five years of regular\n\nservice. This controversy assumes importance in the context\n\nof doctors appointed by direct recruitment and contract\n\ndoctors absorbed under the Absorption Rules. The\n\nappointment by direct recruitment is the usual mode of\n\nappointment. Since the State Government for various\n\nreasons did not resort to direct recruitment, but appointed\n\ndoctors on contract basis, the need to regularise them arose\n\nand Absorption Rules of 2006, 2007 and 2009 were made.\n\nTherefore, the terms and conditions for appointment of\ndoctors by direct recruitment are distinct from the terms and\n\nconditions of Absorption of contract doctors, which are made\n\nunder special Rules of Absorption, whereas recruitment\n\nunder the Recruitment Rules are general Rules. Of course,\n\nonce the contract doctors are absorbed into service, a\n\ncommon seniority list of the directly recruited doctors and the\n\nabsorbed doctors would be formulated. Under the Absorption\n\nRules, 2006, 2007 and 2009, the contract doctors subsequent\n\nto Absorption had to work atleast for a period of six years\n\nfrom the date of Absorption in rural areas and were not to be\n\ndeputed for higher studies during that period. The State\n\nGovernment felt that this condition placed on the contract\n\ndoctors who are absorbed under the Absorption Rules with\n\nregard to being ineligible for deputation for higher studies for\n\na period of six years was a stringent condition. Particularly,\n\nhaving regard to the fact that insofar as directly recruited\n\ndoctors had to complete only five years of regular service for\n\nbeing eligible to be deputed for higher studies under the\n\nDeputation Rules. It is under these circumstances, that the\n\nState Government omitted the clause pertaining to ineligibility\n\nfor deputation for higher studies for a period of six years\npursuant to absorption under the Absorption Rules. As a\n\nresult, of the omission of the said condition from the\n\nAbsorption Rules, the contract doctors who were absorbed\n\ninto regular service became eligible for deputation for higher\n\nstudies even during the period of service in rural areas or in\n\nother words within a period of six years from the date of\n\nabsorption.\n\n59. It is in this background, that the in-service candidates\n\nappointed by direct recruitment as well as the doctors who\n\nwere absorbed under the Absorption Rules of 2006 have a\n\ngrievance with regard to the amendment made to the\n\nAbsorption Rules by way of omission of the condition\n\nregarding eligibility for deputation for higher studies. Of\n\ncourse, the directly recruited doctors have assailed the\n\nAmendment Rules made to the Absorption Rules, whereas\n\nthose doctors absorbed under the Absorption Rules of 2006\n\nhave not assailed the said Rules.\n\n60. While considering the respective contentions of the\n\nlearned counsel on both sides, what becomes clear is the fact\nthat doctors appointed by direct recruitment as well as\n\ndoctors appointed initially on contract basis and\n\nsubsequently absorbed into regular service are a class apart\n\nand form two distinct categories and the classification\n\nbetween these two categories of doctors are on the basis of an\n\nintelligible differentia having a nexus to the object sought to\n\nbe achieved. Therefore, we are of the view that the doctors\n\nappointed by direct recruitment cannot maintain a challenge\n\nto the terms and conditions of the absorption of the contract\n\ndoctors as the Absorption Rules are Special Rules and in no\n\nway have any adverse impact on the terms and conditions of\n\nappointment of the doctors appointed by direct recruitment.\n\nOn the other hand, the State Government has saved the\n\nstatus and position of doctors appointed by direct recruitment\n\nin Rule 4 of the Absorption Rules by stating that the service\n\nrendered by a person as a contract doctor prior to the date of\n\nabsorption shall not count for the purpose of seniority,\n\ngranting of promotion as specialist under the Time Bound\n\nAdvancement Scheme or for Grant Selection Time Scale of\n\nPay etc. On the other hand, Rule 5 of the Absorption Rules\n\nstates that all the rules regulating the conditions and service\nof the Government servants insofar as they are inconsistent\n\nwith the provisions of the Absorption Rules shall not apply to\n\npersons absorbed under the Absorption Rules which are as\n\nstated above special rules and which are also made under\n\nSection 8 of the Karnataka Civil Services Act. Therefore, the\n\nAbsorption Rules are Special Rules and the absorbed doctors\n\nare a special category of doctors. The controversy, however,\n\ndoes not end.\n\n61. In the context of admission to Post-graduate Courses by\n\ndeputation of doctors is concerned, the grievance of the\n\nappellants is with regard to the omission of the condition that\n\nthe contract doctors absorbed under the Absorption Rules\n\nshall not be deputed for higher studies during a period of six\n\nyears from the date of absorption by virtue of the Amendment\n\nRules. The said amendment to the Absorption Rules are\n\nmade with retrospective effect from 30.12.2011 i.e., the date\n\nwhen the Draft Rules were published as stated in the Draft\n\nRules itself and therefore, the contention of the appellants is\n\nthat the amendment to the Absorption Rules omitting such a\n\ncondition with retrospective effect is arbitrary, unreasonable\nand violative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India\n\nas they have been made after the process of selection for Post-\n\ngraduate courses commenced. Such a contention cannot be\n\naccepted for two reasons. Firstly, because as stated above,\n\nthe doctors appointed by way of direct recruitment from a\n\ndistinct class as opposed to contract doctors regularised\n\nunder the Absorption Rules and secondly, the Absorption\n\nRules themselves are made under Section 8 of the Karnataka\n\nCivil Services Act which permits rules to be made with\n\nretrospective effect. Therefore, the appellants have also\n\ncontended that if the omission of the condition made by the\n\nAmendment Rules is held to be valid, then in that case Rule\n\n61 read with Appendix-IIA of the KCSR (Deputation Rules)\n\nwould automatically occupy the field and it is only those\n\ndoctors who have put in five years of regular service and are\n\nbelow 45 years of age would be entitled for deputation and\n\ntherefore, the contract doctors absorbed under Absorption\n\nRules 2007 and 2009 are doctors who have not completed five\n\nyears of regular service would be ineligible to be deputed for\n\nPost-graduate studies as in-service candidates.\n62. It is in this context that Rule 61 of the KCSR pertaining\n\nto deputation for higher studies and the PGET Rules of 2006\n\nhave to be considered together. As already analysed above,\n\nthe PGET Rules, 2006 have several conditions to be fulfilled\n\nby in-service candidates before they can be admitted for Post-\n\ngraduate Courses which conditions are not found in Rule 61\n\nof the KCSR. The object and purpose of the PGET Rules,\n\n2006 is to select the most meritorious candidates for Post-\n\ngraduate Courses even within the in-service quota, on the\n\nbasis of the conditions prescribed under the Rules at the\n\nstage of application for the Entrance Test, at the stage of\n\nappearance for the Entrance Test and finally at the stage of\n\nadmission to the Post-graduate courses. It is also noted that\n\neven if an in-service candidate fulfills the condition of Rule 61\n\nof the KCSR, he would not be entitled to admission for a Post-\n\ngraduate course until and unless he fulfills the conditions\n\nprescribed under the PGET Rules 2006. The Deputation\n\nRules on the other hand, do not deal with the necessity of\n\ntaking an Entrance Test for being selected and admitted to a\n\nPost-graduate Medical or Dental Course. The PGET Rules\n2006 are thus \"Special Rules\" framed by the State\n\nGovernment in the matter of admission to Post-graduate\n\nMedical and Dental Courses both degree and Diploma of\n\npursuant to the decision of Supreme Court in Gopal\n\nD.Thirthani and\nRegulation 9\nof the PGME Regulations.\n\nRegulation 9\nof the said Regulation reads as follows:\n\n\"6.\nRegulation 9\nof the Regulations framed by the\nMedical Council of India reads as follows:\n\n\"9. Selection of postgraduate students-(1)\nStudents for postgraduate medical courses shall\nbe selected strictly on the basis of their academic\nmerit.\n\nFor determining the academic merit, the\nuniversity/institution may adopt any one of the\nfollowing procedures both for degree and diploma\ncourses:\n\non the basis of merit as determined by a\ncompetitive test conducted by the State\nGovernment or by the competitive authority\n\nappointed by the State Government or by the\nuniversity/group of universities in the same State;\n\non the basis of merit as determined by centralised\ntest held at the national level; or\n\non the basis of the individual cumulative\nperformance at the first, second and third MBBS\nexaminations, if such examination have been\npassed from the same university; or\ncombination of (i) and (iii):\n\nProvided that whatever entrance test for\npostgraduate admissions is held by a State\nGovernment or a university or any other authorised\nexamining body, the minimum percentage of marks\nfor eligibility for admission to postgraduate\nmedical course shall be fifty per cent for all the\ncandidates:\n\nProvided further that in non-governmental\ninstitutions fifty per cent of the total seats shall be\nfilled by the competent authority and the\nremaining fifty per cent by the management of the\ninstitution on the basis of merit.\"\n\n63. Having regard to the aforesaid Regulations, the State\n\nGovernment has framed the PGET Rules 2006 prescribing not\n\nonly the mode of selection for admission to Post-graduate\n\ncourses both medical and dental, but also the eligibility of the\ncandidates for prosecuting such courses. The object of PGET\n\nRules 2006 is to select and admit those candidates who are\n\nmeritorious having secured 50% atleast in the Entrance Test,\n\nprovided they have the eligibility to apply and take the exam\n\nas well as being admitted to the course. The Apex court\n\nin several decisions has emphasised on the need to maintain\n\nmerit in the matter of selection and admission of candidates\n\nfor professional courses, particularly at the level of Post-\n\ngraduate and Super Speciality Courses. Therefore, in the\n\ninstant case, we cannot lost sight of the fact that admissions\n\nare being made to Post-graduate Medical Courses, where\n\nmerit is the overwhelming condition for admission of all the\n\ncandidates, in-service or non-service, who have to take a\n\ncommon Entrance Test and but for a separate stream of\n\nadmission being kept apart, the in-service candidates would\n\nhave otherwise competed with the non-service candidates.\n\nThe prescription of the eligibility criteria under the PGET\n\nRules 2006 would therefore, prevail over any other Rules of\n\nDeputation made as a condition of service for higher studies.\n\nIn the instant case what we have discerned is the eligibility\n\nfor admission to Post-graduate course and not a mere\ndeputation for higher studies. The selection and admission\n\nfor a Post-graduate course is circumscribed by certain terms\n\nand conditions prescribed under the PGET Rules 2006 which\n\nare common both with regard to in-service candidates as well\n\nas those candidates who are not in service. But as far as in-\n\nservices candidates are concerned, certain additional\n\nprescriptions are made under the PGET Rules 2006 and it\n\nhas already been observed that these additional prescriptions\n\nare absent in the KCSR. Therefore, the PGET Rules 2006\n\nbeing Special Rules for admission to a Post-graduate Course\n\nwould obviously prevail over the Rule 61 of the KCSR, which\n\nis a general rule for deputation. Also, an in-service candidate,\n\nmerely on the basis of his seniority cannot be sent for\n\ndeputation and admitted to a Post-graduate course, unless he\n\nqualifies under PGET 2006 Rules. Moreover, under the\n\nDeputation Rules, it is only upto 5% of the sanctioned\n\npermanent strength of the concerned cadre that can be\n\ndeputed for higher studies. Whereas, under the PGET Rules\n\n2006 within the seat matrix, certain percentage of seats are\n\ncategorised as Government seats as opposed to Management\n\nseats and within the quota of Government seats, certain seats\nare ear-marked for in-service candidates in which there is\n\nreservation of seats for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe\n\nas per Rule 12 of the PGET Rules 2006. Therefore, there are\n\nnumerous conditions which have to be complied with by an\n\nin-service candidate before becoming eligible for admission for\n\na Post-graduate course though by way of deputation. It is for\n\nall the aforesaid reasons, we hold that the PGET Rules, 2006\n\nwould prevail over the Deputation Rules in the matter of\n\nadmission to Post-graduate courses in Medical. In other\n\nwords the PGET Rules 2006 have an over-riding effect over\n\nthe Deputation Rules made under KCSR.\n\n64.\nSection 6\nof the Act states that the Act and any Rule\n\nmade or deemed to have been made thereunder would have\n\neffect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith\n\ncontained in any other law with respect to matters for which\n\nprovision is made in the Act or for which Rules can be made\n\nunder the Act. At the same time, Section 12 of the Capitation\n\nFee Act also states that the provisions of the said Act would\n\nhave effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith\n\ncontain in any other law for the time being in force.\n65. Learned Senior Counsel for some of the appellants has\n\nbrought to our notice these two provisions to contend that\n\nultimately, the Rules made under the Act would prevail over\n\nthe Rules made under the Capitation Fee Act. On a\n\ncomparative reading of the two provisions, we note that they\n\nare made in two different enactments whose objects are\n\ntotally alien to each other. However, the overlapping aspect is\n\nwith regard to deputation of in-service doctors for Post-\n\ngraduate studies. Insofar as this aspect is concerned, under\n\nthe Act provision is made only for the deputation of in-service\n\ndoctors for higher studies based on seniority, the number of\n\nyears of regular service and the age factor. No provision is\n\nmade with regard to the eligibility for selection and admission\n\non the basis of merit. In fact, Rule 61 of the KCSR read with\n\nAppendix-II are silent on this aspect. On the other hand, the\n\nPGET rules 2006 made under the provision of Capitation Act\n\ndeals with not only the number of years of requisite service,\n\nthe maximum age limit and also eligibility being based on\n\nmerit. In fact Section 12 of the Capitation Fee Act provides\n\nfor an over-riding effect of the provisions of the Act\nnotwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other\n\nlaw for the time being in force. The Deputation Rules made\n\nunder KCSR were in force prior to the enactment of the\n\nCapitation Fee Act. However, it is the provisions of the\n\nCapitation Fee Act which would prevail over any other law for\n\nthe time being in force in view of the non-obstante clause in\n\nSection 12.\n\n66. In this context, Section 4 of the Capitation Fee Act\n\nprovides for the minimum qualification for admission, the\n\nmaximum students who could be admitted to the course of\n\nstudy and the reservation of seats. Further, pursuant to the\n\ndirections in Gopal Thirthani,\nRegulation 9\nof the PGME\n\nRegulations have been made which also speaks about merit\n\ndetermined by a competitive test. These Regulations are\n\nframed by the Medical Council of India, which is the\n\nAuthority responsible for maintaining standards in medical\n\neducation through out India. Therefore, for these reasons\n\nalso, we hold that the PGET Rules 2006 have an over-riding\n\neffect over the Deputation Rules made under the KCSR.\n67.\nSection 8\nof the Act empowers the State Government to\n\nmake Rules to carry out the purposes of the Act with\n\nretrospective effect and when such a Rule is made, the\n\nreasons for making the Rule has to be specified in a\n\nstatement to be laid in both Houses of the State Legislature\n\nand subject to any modification, every Rule made under the\n\nAct has the effect as if it is enacted in the Act. The\n\nAbsorption Rules have been made by virtue of Rule 8 of the\n\nAct.\n\n68. It is a settled position in law that if on a particular\n\nsubject several rules have been made, the Special Rules\n\nwould always prevail over the general rules vide Maya\n\nMathew V/s. State of Kerala & others (2010) 4 SCC 498).\n\nIn the instant case, we have held that the PGET Rules 2006\n\nare Special Rules of admission for Post-graduate Courses\n\nwhich also take into consideration the deputation of in-\n\nservice candidates for such courses. They are special rules\n\nwith regard to deputation for higher studies, which would\n\nprevail over the general rules of deputation under the KCSR.\n69. Since we have held that it is only the PGET Rules 2000,\n\nwhich have to be considered for the purpose of deputation for\n\nPost-graduate studies from the category of in-service\n\ncandidates, we also hold that the decision of this Court in\n\nDr.Ranganath's case under which three separate merit lists\n\nwere prepared based on the length of service of the in-service\n\ncandidates completed were upheld and also the interim order\n\nof the learned Single Judge in W.P.No.15539/2011 dated\n\n01.05.2011 and the subsequent order of the Division Bench\n\ndated 07.06.2011 are not relevant for the present controversy.\n\nEven if for a moment it is considered that the PGET Rules,\n\n2006 do not have an over-riding effect over the Deputation\n\nRules, even then, having regard to the amendment made to\n\nthe Absorption Rules, 2006, 2007 and 2009, which we uphold\n\nit would not be now necessary to prepare three separate merit\n\nlists of in-service doctors as all doctors absorbed under the\n\nsaid Absorption Rules are eligible to take the Entrance Test\n\nprovided they fulfil the eligibility criteria prescribed under\n\nPGET Rules. We hold that amendments made to the\n\nAbsorption Rules are valid. Firstly because, they are made\n\nunder Rule 8 of the Act which itself permits making Rules\nwith retrospective effect and secondly, because the\n\namendment made to the Absorption Rules would have no\n\nimpact on the right of the directly recruited doctors to\n\nparticipate in the admission process to Post-graduate\n\nCourses, as the directly recruited doctors and the contract\n\ndoctors who have been subsequently absorbed fall into\n\ndifferent classes. That apart, the effect of the amendments\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules have enlarged the scope of\n\neligibility of in-service candidates and has not taken away the\n\nvested right of in-service candidate from participating in the\n\nselection and admission process. Therefore, the amendment\n\nmade with retrospective effect i.e., from 30.12.2011, prior to\n\nthe last date of filing of applications for the Entrance Test are\n\nlegal and valid.\n\n70. In N.T.Devin Katti & others -V/s- KPSC & others\n\n(1990)3 SCC 157) the Apex Court has held thus:\n\n\"If the recruitment Rules are amended\nretrospectively during the pendency of selection, in\nthat event selection must be held in accordance\nwith the amended Rules. Whether the Rules have\nretrospective effect or not, primarily depends upon\nthe language of the Rules and its construction to\nascertain the legislative intent. The legislative\nintent is ascertained either by express provision or\nby necessary implication; if the amended Rules are\nnot retrospective in nature the selection must be\nregulated in accordance with the rules and orders\nwhich were in force on the date of advertisement.\nDetermination of this question largely depends on\nthe facts of each case having regard to the terms\nand conditions set out in the advertisement and the\nrelevant rules and orders. Lest there be any\nconfusion, we would like to make it clear that a\ncandidate on making application for a post\npursuant to an advertisement does not acquire any\nvested right of selection, but if he is eligible and is\notherwise qualified in accordance with the relevant\nrules and the terms contained in the advertisement,\nhe does acquire a vested right of being considered\nfor selection is accordance with the rules as they\nexisted on the date of advertisement. He cannot be\ndeprived of that limited right on the amendment of\nrules during the pendency of selection unless the\namended rules are retrospective in nature.\"\n71. In the case of P.D.Aggarwal & others V/s. State of\n\nU.P. & others (1987) 3 SCC 622) also the Apex Court has\n\nheld that the Government has got the power under proviso to\n\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution to make such rules and to\n\namend them giving retrospective effect. Nevertheless, such\n\nretrospective amendments cannot take away the vested rights\n\nand the amendments must be reasonable, not arbitrary or\n\ndiscriminatory and violating\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution. To the same effect are the observations in the\n\ncase of Union of India & others V/s. Tushar Ranjan\n\nMohanty & others (1994) 5 SCC 450).\n\n72. There can be no contrary view to the aforesaid\n\nobservations of the Apex Court. However, in the instant case\n\nSection 8\nof the Act specifically empowers the State\n\nGovernment to make rules with retrospective effect. It is on\n\nthe strength of the said provision that the amendments have\n\nbeen made to the Absorption Rules of the Act. That apart, by\n\nthe amendments made to the Absorption Rules, no vested\n\nright of the appellants for being considered for selection and\n\nadmission for Post-graduate Medical Courses in terms of their\nmerit have been taken away. In the instant case, the\n\namendments are made to the Absorption Rules with effect\n\nfrom 30.12.2011 i.e., prior to the last date for submission of\n\napplications to appear in the Entrance Test by the said\n\nAmendment Rules. The right of the appellants who were\n\nabsorbed under Absorption Rules 2006 to be considered for\n\nselection and admission has not been deprived. Their rights\n\nhave remained intact. On the other hand, the effect of the\n\namendment made to the Absorption Rules is to enlarge the\n\nscope of eligibility to the doctors who have been absorbed\n\nunder the Absorption Rules of 2006, 2007 and 2009.\n\n73. As far as the appellants who are the direct recruits are\n\nconcerned, they are a class apart and cannot fall into the\n\nsame category as the contract doctors who have been\n\nabsorbed into service. Therefore, their right to be selected\n\nand admitted is totally unaffected by the amendment made to\n\nthe Absorption Rules. Whereas, as far as contract doctors\n\nabsorbed under the Absorption Rules, 2006 is concerned, the\n\namendment in fact enures to their benefit. It is for this\n\nreason that they have not assailed the amendment made to\nAbsorption Rules, 2006. Even this class of doctors cannot\n\nhave any grievance to the amendment made to the Absorption\n\nRules of 2007 and 2009 having regard to the fact that the\n\ndoctors absorbed under the Absorption Rules, 2006 are\n\nthemselves the beneficiaries of the amendment and their right\n\nto selection and admission to Post-graduate Courses is\n\nunaffected. Therefore, the amendments in no way take away\n\nthe vested rights of the contract doctors absorbed under the\n\nAbsorption Rules, 2006. Therefore, the amendments made to\n\nthe Absorption Rules 2006, 2007 and 2009 are valid.\n\n74. Learned Senior Counsel appearing for some of the\n\nrespondents has relied upon the following decisions with\n\nregard to the permissibility of the retrospective operation of\n\nRules. In the case of State Bank's Staff Union (Madras\n\nCircle) V/s. Union of India and others (2005 (7) SCC 584)\n\nit has been held that:\n\n\"31. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted\nthat vested rights cannot be taken away by the\nlegislature by way of retrospective legislation. The\nplea is without substance. Whenever any\namendment is brought in force retrospectively or\nany provision of the Act is deleted retrospectively,\nin this process rights of some are bound to be\naffected one way or the other. In every case the\nexercise by the legislature by introducing a new\nprovision or deleting an existing provision with\nretrospective effect per se does not amount to\nviolation of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. The\nlegislature can change as observed by this Court in\nCauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, Re the basis on\nwhich a decision is given by the Court and thus\nchange the law in general, which will affect a class\nof persons and events at large. It cannot, however,\nset aside an individual decision inter partes and\naffect their rights and liabilities alone. Such an act\non the part of the legislature amounts to exercising\nthe judicial power by the State and to function as\nan appellate court or tribunal, which is against the\nconcept of separation of powers.\"\n\n75. To the same effect are Bhubaneshwar Singh &\n\nanother V/s. Union of India & others (1994) 6 SCC 77),\n\nK.V.Subba Rao & others V/s. Government of Andhra\n\nPradesh & others (1988) 2 SCC 201) and Dr. Indrani\nPyarelal gupta & others V/s. W.R.Natu & others (AIR\n\n1963 SCC 274). Since\nSection 8\nof the Act itself permits the\n\nRule making authority to make Rule with retrospective effect\n\nas State Government Rules are valid and as they have effect\n\nprior to the last date for receipt of application for the\n\nEntrance Test, there can be no grievance on the score.\n\n76. In Mahabir Vegetable Oils (P) Ltd & another V/s.\n\nState of Haryana & others (2006) 3 SCC 620) and\n\nN.T.Devin Katti & others V/s. Karnataka Public Service\n\nCommission & others (1990) 3 SCC 157) also Recruitment\n\nRules were amended retrospectively during the pendency of\n\nselection, in that event selection must be held in terms of the\n\nAmended Rule, is the dicta of the Apex Court. The said\n\nanalogy would also apply for selection and admission to\n\nprofessional courses.\n\n77. The next issue to be considered is with regard to the\n\nmaintainability of a challenge to a service rule before the High\n\nCourt as opposed to the Administrative Tribunal. In\n\nL.Chandra Kumar V/s. Union of India & others (1997) 3\nSCC 261) the Apex Court has held that though\n\nAdministrative Tribunals are competent to hear matters\n\nwhere the vires of statutory provisions are questioned, but in\n\ndischarging this duty, they cannot act as substitutes for the\n\nHigh Courts and the Supreme court which have, under our\n\nconstitutional set-up, been specifically entrusted with such\n\nan obligation. Their function in this respect is only\n\nsupplementary and all such decisions of the Tribunals will be\n\nsubject to scrutiny before a Division Bench of the respective\n\nHigh Courts. Though the Tribunals act as the courts of first\n\ninstance in respect of the areas of law for which they have\n\nbeen constituted and the litigants would have to approach the\n\nTribunals prior to approaching the High Court, but having\n\nregard to the fact that the quintessence of the controversy in\n\nthese cases is with regard to the selection and admission of\n\nin-service doctors to Post-graduate Medical Courses and the\n\nchallenge made to the amendment to the Absorption Rules is\n\nalso one of the questions to be determined, we are of the view\n\nthat the learned Single Judge was not right in holding that\n\nthe appellants had to first approach the Administrative\n\nTribunal, assailing the amendment made to the Absorption\nRules and then approach this Court with regard to the\n\nadmission for Post-graduate medical courses.\n\n78. Learned Single Judge was also not right in placing\n\nreliance on another decision of the Apex Court in the case of\n\nRajeev Kumar & another V/s. Hemraj Singh Chauhan &\n\nothers (2010) 4 SCC 554). In the said case, the appellants\n\ntherein had tried to implead themselves at the stage when the\n\nmatter was before the High Court, whereas they were not\n\nparties before the Central Administrative Tribunal. It is\n\nunder those circumstances, the Apex Court held that the\n\nappellants could not approach the High Court directly by\n\ntreating it as the Court of first instance.\n\n79. Even otherwise, the amendment to the Absorption Rules\n\nis closely linked with the eligibility criteria prescribed under\n\nthe PGET Rules 2006, which we have held have an over-\n\nriding effect on the Deputation Rules. It is in order to create\n\na level playing field for all in-service category candidates,\n\nwhether appointed by regular recruitment or by way of\n\nabsorption that the embargo on deputation for higher studies\nfor a period of six years immediately after absorption has\n\nbeen omitted. The main issue in these cases is with regard to\n\neligibility of the in-service doctors to be admitted to post-\n\ngraduate medical course. The challenge to the amendment to\n\nAbsorption Rules is only incidental. Therefore, this High\n\nCourt has the jurisdiction to consider a challenge made to\n\nService Rules in the context of admission of in-service doctors\n\nto Post-graduate medical courses. Therefore, that portion of\n\nthe order of the learned Single Judge that no challenge to a\n\nService Rule is permissible before this Court is set aside.\n\n80. This leaves us with the consideration of one other\n\ncontention pertaining to the validity of Rule 5A of the PGET\n\nRules, 2006 granting weightage to those in-service candidates\n\nwho have rendered service in rural areas. The said Rule was\n\ninserted by the Amendment Rules of 2011 by virtue of\n\nnotification dated 18.01.2011. However, it was withdrawn\n\nwith immediate effect on 07.03.2011, but was revived with\n\neffect from 07.04.2011. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 5A pertains to\n\nthe giving of weightage of four marks for each completed year\n\nof service beyond five years of service to the marks secured in\nthe Entrance Test subject to maximum of thirty marks,\n\nprovided the candidate has secured the minimum qualifying\n\nmarks. The proviso states that for each completed year of\n\nrural service beyond five years of service, a weightage of eight\n\nmarks would be added to the marks secured in the Entrance\n\nTest instead of four marks, subject to maximum of thirty\n\nmarks. 'Rural Service' has been explained to include the\n\nservice rendered in rural areas under the contract period as\n\nwell as rural service rendered under the Rural Weightage\n\nSelection. The challenge is made to the proviso as it\n\nprescribes eight marks in lieu of four marks to the doctors\n\nwho have served in rural areas and secondly, that the\n\nweightage of eight marks is unreasonable. The Supreme\n\nCourt in Gopal Thirthani has held that weightage given for\n\nrural service is valid provided it is reasonable.\n\n81. In the instant case, insofar as non-rural service is\n\nconcerned, four marks for each completed year of service\n\nbeyond five years of service are added. But insofar as rural\n\nservice is concerned, it is eight marks. In other words, it is\n\nthe double the marks awarded in sub-rule (1) of Rule 5A. In\nthat view of the matter, it cannot be held to be unreasonable.\n\nIn fact, the weightage of marks could have been '1' mark for\n\nnon-rural service and '2' marks for rural service or '2' marks\n\nfor non-rural service and '4' marks for rural service. Instead\n\nit is fixed at '4' marks for non-rural service and '8' marks for\n\nrural service. This is a matter, which is within the wisdom of\n\nthe rule making authority and this court cannot sit in\n\njudgment over the quantum of marks awarded for rural\n\nservice. That apart, the challenge made to the award of eight\n\nmarks for rural service is made by those appellants who are\n\nthemselves beneficiaries of the award of four marks for each\n\ncomplete year of service beyond five years under sub-rule(1)\n\nor Rule 5A. The maximum marks that can be awarded is\n\nthirty only. This Rule has been in force from 18.01.2011 or at\n\nany rate from 07.04.2011. The appellants were well aware of\n\nthis Rule and they have participated in the selection and\n\nadmission process for Post-graduate course. They are\n\ntherefore, estopped from challenging the Rule.\n\n82. In State of Jharkhand V/s. Ashok Kumar Dangi\n\n(2011) 13 SCC 383) it has been held that where candidates\nappeared for the exam without challenging the retrospective\n\namendment of the eligibility conditions and participated in\n\nthe selection process without any demur, they would not be\n\npermitted to challenge the retrospective amendments after the\n\ndeclaration of result. To the same effect is Dhananjay Malik\n\n& others V/s. State of Uttaranchal & others (2008) 4 SCC\n\n171). In this case, as observed, the Rule granting weightage\n\nis in force since 07.04.2011 long prior to the notification\n\ndated 21.11.2011 calling upon eligible candidates to apply for\n\nthe Entrance Test.\n\n83. The State Government by Circular dated 11.04.2012\n\npublished the Draft Rank List prepared by allotting service\n\nweightage marks to depute the in-service doctors for Post-\n\ngraduate studies for the year 2012-2013. The Draft Rank List\n\nis in three parts. Those in-service candidates who have\n\ncompleted above five years of service; those candidates who\n\nhave completed above four years of service; and thirdly, those\n\ncandidates who have completed above three years of service.\n\nThe same was objected to by certain doctors by placing\n\nreliance on the Rule 61 of the KCSR and the interim order of\nthe learned Single Judge dated 01.05.2011 passed in\n\nW.P.Nos.15539-42/2011 as well as the confirmatory order of\n\nthe Division Bench. Subsequently, they challenged the\n\namendments made to the Absorption Rules, 2007 and 2009\n\ngiving retrospective effect from 30.12.2011. By interim order\n\ndated 15.05.2012, the amendments to the Absorption Rules\n\nwere stayed by this Court. As a result, the State Government\n\nprepared another merit list excluding those in-service\n\ncandidates who were absorbed into service pursuant to the\n\n2007 and 2009 Absorption Rules. Consequently, the in-\n\nservice candidates who were excluded from the merit list, filed\n\nwrit petitions seeking quashing of Circular dated 15.05.2012\n\nand to allow the petitioners to appear for counseling to be\n\nheld on 17.05.2012 as per the notification dated 04.05.2012.\n\nIt is under these circumstances, that the learned Single\n\nJudge by interim order dated 24.05.2012 directed\n\nmaintenance of status quo in respect of the counseling which\n\nhad already taken place and had stayed further counseling.\n\n84. The only other controversy is, with regard to the State\n\nGovernment preparing a fresh merit list pursuant to the\nInterim Order of stay granted by this court on 15.05.2012,\n\nstaying the operation of the amendments made to the\n\nAbsorption Rules to 2006, 2007 and 2009. On account of the\n\norder of stay granted by this court, the State Government\n\napplied Rule 61 of the KCSR and selected only those\n\ncandidates who had completed five years of regular service\n\nand who are below 48 years of age while revising merit list as\n\nthe initial merit list comprised of in-service doctors who had\n\ncompleted three years of regular service. In this context, the\n\ncase of the doctors regularised under the Absorption Rules of\n\n2006 is slightly different from the case of doctors regularised\n\npursuant to regular Absorption Rules of 2007 and 2009. As\n\nfar as the contract doctors appointed under the Absorption\n\nRules of 2006 is concerned, what is contended is, since under\n\nRule 61 of the KCSR, they have completed five years of\n\nregular service, in the year 2011, they were eligible to take the\n\nEntrance Test, but the doctors absorbed under the\n\nAbsorption Rules 2007 and 2009, were not eligible to take the\n\nEntrance Test since they had not completed five years of\n\nregular service under the Deputation Rules. It has been held\n\nthat Rule 61 of the KCSR (Deputation Rules) are not at all\napplicable as in the matter of admission to Post-graduate\n\ncourses under the PGET Rules, 2006 in-service doctors who\n\nhave completed three years of regular service and who are\n\neligible under various eligibility criteria prescribed under the\n\nPGET Rules 2006 and who have taken the Entrance Test and\n\nhave secured a minimum of 50% are eligible to be considered\n\nfor admission. In that view of the matter, the State\n\nGovernment could not have excluded the doctors absorbed\n\nunder the 2007 and 2009 Rules from the merit list pursuant\n\nto the interim order dated 15.05.2012 granted by this court.\n\nFor that matter, even directly recruited doctors who have\n\ncompleted three years of regular service and have taken the\n\nEntrance Test have to be considered while drawing up of the\n\nmerit list. In the circumstances, the merit list prepared by the\n\nState Government excluding all doctors who have not\n\ncompleted five years of regular service is illegal and requires\n\nto be quashed. The State Government has to prepare the\n\nmerit list of all in-service candidates who have completed\n\nthree years of regular service by also taking into consideration\n\nGovernment Order dated 29.01.2010 which has been upheld\n\nby this Court on 26.04.2010 and have completed the period of\nprobation for the purpose of admission to the Post-graduate\n\ncourses subject to fulfilling of other conditions prescribed under\n\nthe PGET Rules 2006.\n\n85. In view of our findings, we direct the extension of time for\n\nthe completion of counseling process for admission to Post-\n\ngraduate Medical Courses for the in-sesrvice category of doctors\n\nby ten days from today as per the common merit list prepared\n\nprior to the interim order dated 15.05.2012 and keeping in mind\n\nall eligibility criteria prescribed under PGET Rules 2006.\n\n86. While we issue the aforesaid direction, we are also\n\nconscious of the directions and observations of the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Mridul dhar (Minor) & another V/s. Union\n\nof India & others (2005) 2 SCC 65), Medical council of India\n\nV/s. Manas Ranjan Behera & others (2010) 1 SCC 173) and\n\nalso the more recent decision in the case of Priya Gupta V/s.\n\nState of Chhatisgarh (Civil Appeal No.4318/2012 disposed\n\nof on 08.05.2012). However, with all due respect and\n\ndeference to the Apex Court, this Court has been constrained to\n\nintervene in these matters having regard to the nature of\ncontroversy touching upon the process of selection and rule of\n\nmerit, as in the instant case, there was no certainty with regard\n\nto the merit list itself having regard to the claims and counter\n\nclaims raised by various groups within the in-service category\n\nand the impact of the interim order dated 15.05.2012 on the\n\nmerit list which was altered owing to the stay of the amendment\n\nmade to the Absorption Rules. Therefore, we think it was the\n\nduty of this Court to resolve the controversy in such a manner,\n\nthat ultimately, merit would prevail in the matter of selection\n\nand admission to the Post-graduate Courses for the year 2012-\n\n2013. It is, in these circumstances, that this Court has been\n\nunder a duty to intervene in these matters. In the result, the\n\nappeals are dismissed. Parties to bear their own costs.\n\nSd/-\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE\n\nSd/-\n\nJUDGE\nS*\nIndex: Y/N",
