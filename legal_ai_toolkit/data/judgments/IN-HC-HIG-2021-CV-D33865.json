This present petition has been filed under\nSection 11(6)\nof\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 ('Act', for short) with\nthe following prayers:\n\n\"It is most respectfully prayed that this Hon'ble\nCourt may be pleased to:\n\n(i) appoint a Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the\nclaims of the Petitioner in accordance with the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\nas amended;\n\n(ii) declare that Hon'ble Justice Aruna Suresh\n(retired) has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\ndisputes between the parties;\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 1\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n15:40:37\n(iii) Award costs of this Petition in favour of the\nPetitioner and against the Respondent;\n(iv) Pass such other and further order(s) as this\n\nHon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts\nand circumstances of the present case.\"\n\n2. The petitioner herein is a company incorporated under the\n\nCompanies Act, 2013\nand having its registered office at Ground\nFloor-001, Mauryansh Elanza, Shyamai Cross Road, Nr. Parekh\nHospital, Satellite Ahmedabad, Gujarat-380015 (formerly known\nas Alcott Town Planners Pvt. Ltd.).\n\n3. The respondents herein are the joint owners of the\npremises / property situated at 3/16, Main Shankar Road, Old\nRajinder Nagar, New Delhi ('Premises', for short).\n\n4. It is the case of the petitioner and so contended by Mr.\nJeevan Ballav Panda, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nthat the petitioner and respondents entered into a Lease Deed\ndated May 27, 2019 ('Lease Deed', for short) in respect of the\nPremises.\n\n5. Pursuant to the execution of the Lease Deed, petitioner\nstarted fulfilling the obligations contained thereunder on the\nassumption that the respondents will also do the same and even\ndisbursed an amount of Rs.3,32,000/- to the respondents in order\nto expedite the refurbishment and upgradation of the Premises to\nmake it at par with the petitioner's benchmark.\n\n6. Thereafter it took over the Premises and started using\nthe same for the purposes of its commercial activities as laid\ndown in the Lease Deed. In the wake of the corona virus\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 2\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\npandemic, the entire hospitality sector faced huge financial\nsetback and on account of the same, the petitioner sought to\ninvoke the force majeure clause in the Lease Deed vide email\ndated March 27, 2020.\n\n7. He stated that after detailed discussion with the\nrepresentatives of the petitioner, the respondents while agreeing\nto the invocation of the force majeure clause agreed to amend the\ncommercial understanding between the parties in the interim.\n\n8. Mr. Panda submitted that the respondents were in breach\nin terms of Clause 11.2.1 of the Lease Deed, which obligated the\nrespondents to obtain as well as maintain all requisite building\napprovals required for running the Premises as a commercial\nestablishment for the purposes as laid down in the Lease Deed. It\nis submitted by him that even after repeated communications and\ngrant of time as sought by the respondents, the respondents failed\nto furnish the complete set of documents as mandated under\nClause 11.2.1 of the Lease Deed.\n\n9. That while attempts were being made to get the breach of\nClause 11.2.1 cured, the respondents suddenly and to the\ncomplete shock and dismay of the petitioner, issued a letter date\nJune 03, 2020 demanding a sum of money by misrepresenting the\nclauses of the Lease Deed.\n\n10. Thereafter, the respondents, vide notice dated June 23,\n2020, invoked arbitration clause citing the existence of disputes\nbetween the parties arising under the Lease Deed and nominated\na learned Retd. Judge of this Court as the sole Arbitrator to\nadjudicate the disputes between the parties in terms of the dispute\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 3\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nresolution clause contained in the Lease Deed. It is also stated by\nhim that the petitioner, however, could not respond to the said\nnotice owing to various logistical constraints on account of the\ncorona virus pandemic. Therefore, it is his submission that the\nrecommendation of the respondents was not confirmed by the\npetitioner.\n\n11. Mr. Panda stated that despite there being no confirmation\nfrom the petitioner or mutual agreement, the respondents instead\nof approaching this Court under the mandate of the Act, illegally\nconfirmed the appointment of the sole Arbitrator.\n\n12. It is also submitted that the sole Arbitrator issued notice\non August 12, 2020 to the parties for the primary hearing to be\nheld on August 29, 2020, when for the first time, the petitioner\nbecame aware of the appointment of the sole Arbitrator, and\nobjected as well as sought cancellation of the primary hearing\nvide letter dated August 26, 2020.\n\n13. Despite the objections being raised, the Arbitrator went\nahead with the hearing as scheduled on August 29, 2020 and the\npetitioner, according to Mr. Panda, during the hearing also raised\nits objection to the proceedings as being in contravention of the\nsettled principles of law and Lease Deed. Thus, it is submitted by\nhim that the sole Arbitrator is de facto as well as de jure\nincapable of entering reference as sole Arbitrator for the\nadjudication of disputes between the parties.\n\n14. Reliance is placed by Mr. Panda on the judgments of\ncoordinate benches of this Court in\nNaveen Kandhar & Anr. v.\nJai Mahal Hotels Pvt. Ltd., (Arb.P.\n453/2017) and Manish\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 4\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nChibber v. Anil Sharma & Anr., (Arb.P. 249/2020), wherein it\nwas held that an appointment of an Arbitrator in contravention of\nthe agreed procedure is non-est and ought to be ignored.\n\n15. Ms. Bobby Anand, learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondents has raised a preliminary objection as to the\nmaintainability of the present petition. It is the case of the\nrespondents and contended by Ms. Anand that while adjudicating\na petition under\nSection 11\nof the Act, the scope of enquiry is\nlimited and the petitioner, under the garb of\nSection 11\n, is in fact\nseeking termination of the mandate of the learned sole Arbitrator,\nwho has already been appointed for adjudication of all disputes\nbetween the parties.\n\n16. By drawing the attention of this Court to the petition, it is\nstated by Ms. Anand that even though the petition has been filed\nunder\nSection 11\nof the Act, reliefs and the various paragraphs of\nthe petition indicate and calls for the termination of the mandate\nof the sole Arbitrator, which relief does not fall within the ambit\nand scope of\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act.\n\n17. It is also stated by Ms. Anand that the present petition is\ninfructuous and therefore liable to be dismissed as the sole\nArbitrator has already given consent and has entered upon\nreference to adjudicate upon all the disputes emanating between\nthe parties from the Lease Deed. In fact, she stated that hearings\nhave taken place on August 29, 2020 and August 30, 2020, which\nhas been duly attended by the petitioner. More so, she also stated\nthat the sole Arbitrator has served upon both the parties an\nundertaking dated September 02, 2020 as per Schedule VI as\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 5\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nmandated under\nSection 12 (1)(b)\nof the Act.\n\n18. Thus, according to Ms. Anand, the mandate of the sole\nArbitrator already appointed cannot be terminated under the\nprovisions of\nSection 11(6)\nof the Act. In fact, it is her\nsubmission that the petitioner is within its right to challenge the\njurisdiction of the Arbitrator by resorting to\nSections 12-15\nof the\nAct, which concedingly not done.\n\n19. Without prejudice, it is also submitted by her that the\npetitioner has not shown as to how the sole Arbitrator already\nappointed has become de jure or de facto unable to perform\nfunctions especially under\nSection 14\nand it is not the case of the\npetitioner that the sole Arbitrator falls under any one of the\ncategories specified in the fifth and / or the seventh schedule of\nthe Act.\n\n20. That apart, it is submitted by Ms. Anand, the issuance of\na prior notice under\nSection 21\nof the Act is sine qua non for\nfiling a petition under\nSection 11\n, which the petitioner has failed\nto issue in respect of the disputes raised by the petitioner in the\npresent petition and that the present petition is nothing but a\ncomplete afterthought.\n\n21. On the conduct of the petitioner, it is stated that the\npetitioner has been delaying the payment of pending monthly\nrentals since March 2020 and it was after repeated reminders that\nthe respondents were forced to invoke the arbitration clause\ncalling upon the petitioner to consent to the appointment of the\nlearned Retd. Judge of this Court, as sole Arbitrator, to which the\npetitioner did not even respond and after the expiry of 30 days,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 6\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nthe appointment was deemed to be accepted by the petitioner.\nEven after her appointment, on the first date of hearing, petitioner\nsought and was granted a period of 15 days for filing an\nappropriate application challenging the appointment of the sole\nArbitrator. No application was in fact moved before the sole\nArbitrator. It is submitted by Ms. Anand that therefore, petitioner\nhaving failed to take any action within the prescribed time, has\nforfeited its right to challenge the appointment. She also\nsubmitted that the petitioner having been acquiesced into the\nappointment of the sole Arbitrator and not resorting to any\nchallenge within a reasonable time shall surely attract doctrine of\nestoppel against the petitioner.\n\n22. Rejoinder was also duly filed by the petitioner, reiterating\nits stand in the petition and refuting the stand of the respondents\nin the reply.\n\n23. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and\nperused the record, the only issue which arises for consideration\nis whether the appointment of the learned arbitrator is at variance\nwith the stipulation in the contract and as such non-est for this\ncourt to grant the relief to the petitioner by appointing a new\narbitrator.\n\n24. To answer this issue, it is necessary to reproduce the\narbitration clause in the contract:\n\n\"18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION- Any dispute or\ncontroversy arising out of or in connection with the Deed\nor its performance, including the validity, interpretation\nor application hereof, shall to the extent possible be\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 7\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nsettled amicably by negotiation and discussion among the\nParties within 30 (thirty) days as of the date requested by\neither Party. Failing which, either Party shall be at\nliberty to refer the matter to arbitration in accordance\nwith the\nIndian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\nThe arbitral panel shall consist of a sole arbitrator\nappointed mutually by the Parties. Any arbitral award\nissued by such sole arbitrator shall be final and binding\non the Parties. The language of the arbitration shall be\nEnglish and seat of arbitration shall be Delhi.\"\n\nEmphasis supplied\n\n25. From the above it is clear that the arbitrator has to be\nappointed mutually by both the parties. The respondent had\ninvoked the arbitration clause and issued notice dated June 23,\n2020 and nominated a retired Judge of this Court as the\nnominator. The notice could not be responded by the petitioner.\n\n26. Mr. Panda is right to submit that the notice /\nrecommendation of the respondents with regard to the learned\narbitrator was not confirmed. Mr. Panda is also right in stating\nthat the respondents should have approached this Court under\n\nSection 11\nof the Act seeking an appointment of an Arbitrator\nwhen the petitioner has not confirmed the appointment.\n\n27. Having said so, it must be held in view of the arbitration\nclause as referred above; the appointment made by the respondent\nis non-est and need to be ignored. The plea of Ms. Anand that the\npresent petition is not maintainable as the petitioner under the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 8\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\ngarb of\nSection 11\nis seeking termination of the mandate of the\nlearned Sole Arbitrator is not appealing for the reason when the\nappointment is non-est, being not in accordance with the agreed\nprocedure, the petitioner is within its right to approach the Court\nfor appointment of an arbitrator under\nSection 11\nof the Act.\n\nThis position of law is well settled in terms of the Supreme Court\njudgment in\nWalter Bau Ag, Legal Successor of the Original\nContractor, Dycheroff & Widmann A.G. v. Municipal\nCorporation of Greater Mumbai & Anr.\n, (2015) 3 SCC 800,\nwherein in paras 8, 9 and 10 the Supreme Court has held as\nunder:\n\n\"8. While it is correct that in Antrix (supra) and\nPricol\nLimited\n(supra), it was opined by this Court that after\nappointment of an Arbitrator is made, the remedy of the\naggrieved party is not under\nSection 11(6)\nbut such\nremedy lies elsewhere and under different provisions of\nthe\nArbitration Act\n(\nSections 12\nand\n), the context in\nwhich the aforesaid view was expressed cannot be lost\nsight of. In Antrix (supra), appointment of the Arbitrator,\nas per ICC Rules, was as per the alternative procedure\nagreed upon, whereas in\nPricol Limited\n(supra), the party\nwhich had filed the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act had already submitted to the jurisdiction of\nthe Arbitrator. In the present case, the situation is\notherwise.\n\n9. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie\nvalid and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 9\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act,\nacceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to\ndebar the jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be\ncountenanced in law. In the present case, the agreed upon\nprocedure between the parties contemplated the\nappointment of the arbitrator by second party within 30\ndays of receipt of a notice from the first party. While the\ndecision in\nDatar Switchgears Ltd.\n(supra) may have\nintroduced some flexibility in the time frame agreed upon\nby the parties by extending it till a point of time anterior to\nthe filing of the application under\nSection 11(6)\nof the\nArbitration Act, it cannot be lost sight of that in the\npresent case the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is\nclearly contrary to the provisions of the Rules governing\nthe appointment of Arbitrators by ICADR, which the\nparties had agreed to abide in the matter of such\nappointment. The option given to the respondent\nCorporation to go beyond the panel submitted by the\nICADR and to appoint any person of its choice was clearly\nnot in the contemplation of the parties. If that be so,\nobviously, the appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane is\nnon-est in law. Such an appointment, therefore, will not\ninhibit the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under\n\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act. It cannot, therefore,\nbe held that the present proceeding is not maintainable in\nlaw.\n\nThe appointment of Shri Justice A.D. Mane made\nbeyond 30 days of the receipt of notice by the petitioner,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 10\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nthough may appear to be in conformity with the law\nlaid\ndown in\n\nDatar Switchgears Ltd.\n(supra), is clearly\ncontrary to the agreed procedure which required the\nappointment made by the respondent Corporation to be\nfrom the panel submitted by the ICADR. The said\nappointment, therefore, is clearly invalid in law.\n\n10. Consequently, we allow the present petition and\nappoint Shri Justice S.R. Sathe, a retired judge of the\nBombay High Page 21 21 Court as the Arbitrator on\nbehalf of the respondent Corporation. Both the Arbitrators\nshall now name the third Arbitrator forthwith whereafter\nthe arbitration proceedings will be held and concluded as\nexpeditiously as possible. The terms of appointment of Shri\nJustice S.R. Sathe as the Arbitrator on behalf of the\nrespondent Corporation will be settled in consultation\nwith the respondent Corporation.\"\n\n28. The aforesaid position is followed by this Coordinate\nBenches of this Court in the cases of\nNaveen Kandhari & Anr.\n\n(supra) and Manish Chibber (supra).\n\nIn\nNaveen Kandhari &\nAnr.\n(supra), on the objection taken by the respondent therein that\nthe an arbitrator has already been appointed by them and hence the\n\nSection 11\npetition is not maintainable, the Court in paragraphs 18\nand 19 held as under:\n\n\"18. A plain reading of the arbitration clause as set out\nabove indicates that an arbitrator was required to be\nappointed by the parties. Thus, the unilateral appointment\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 11\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nof Mr A.P. Dhamija as an arbitrator is contrary to the\narbitration clause and without authority. It is also relevant\nto note that the respondent had invoked the arbitration\nclause by its letter dated 06.06.2016 and unilaterally\ndeclared that it had appointed Mr A.P. Dhamija, Advocate\nas an arbitrator.\n\n19. The said appointment, being contrary to the terms of\nthe arbitration agreement, cannot be considered as an\nappointment at all. It is for all intents and purposes non\nest. Mr A.P. Dhamija has no authority to act as an\narbitrator; his actions are plainly of no consequence.\"\n\n29. Similarly, in the case of Manish Chibber (supra), on the\nsignificance of adherence to the procedure agreed upon by the\nparties to an arbitration agreement with regard mutual/common\nconsent in appointing an arbitrator, the Court has held as under:\n\n\"13.\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act specifically states that, if\na party fails to act as required by the procedure for\nappointment of arbitrator, as agreed upon between the\nparties, the appointment shall, in the case of domestic\narbitration, be made by the High Court, on an application\nof the party, by this Court, where the arbitration is other\nthan an international commercial arbitration. The\nprocedure agreed upon, between the petitioner and the\nrespondents, to appoint the arbitrator in the present case, is\nencapsulated in Clause 22 of the partnership deed dated 1st\nApril, 2016, which already stands reproduced hereinabove.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 12\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nA reading thereof makes it clear that \"appointment by\ncommon consent of all partners\" is the sine qua non, for the\nappointment of the arbitrator to be valid. In the present\ncase, there is nothing, whatsoever, to indicate that, prior to,\nor even at, the time of his appointment as sole arbitrator,\nand of his taking cognizance of the arbitral proceedings,\nthere was any consent, by the petitioner to the appointment\nof Mr. Ankit Batra. Clearly, therefore, the appointment of\nMr. Ankit Batra had not taken place in accordance with\nClause 22 of the partnership deed, dated 1st April, 2016\nsupra.\nSection 11(6)\nof the 1996 Act, therefore, squarely\napplies, and the task of appointment of the arbitrator,\ndevolves on this Court, as there is no consensus, ad idem,\nregarding the arbitrator, who would arbitrate on the\ndisputes between the parties.\"\n\n30. A plea has been taken by Ms. Anand that the petitioner\nhaving participated in the proceedings held on August 29, 2020 is\nestopped from challenging the mandate of the arbitrator. The\nsame is not appealing, when it is the case of the petitioner, that\nduring the hearing, the petitioner had raised the objection, that the\nproceeding being in contravention of principles of law and Lease\nDeed. That apart, the Supreme Court in\nWalter Bau\n(supra), has\nin para 9 stated as under:-\n\n\"9. Unless the appointment of the arbitrator is ex facie\nvalid and such appointment satisfies the Court exercising\njurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\nof the Arbitration Act,\n\nSignature Not Verified acceptance of such appointment as a fait accompli to debar\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:ANIL KUMAR ARB.P. 424/2020 Page 13\n\nSigning Date:09.02.2021\n\n15:40:37\n\nthe jurisdiction under\nSection 11(6)\ncannot be countenanced\nin law. ........\" emphasis supplied\n\nTherefore, the petitioner has rightly filed the present\npetition under\nSection 11\nof the Act, which is under\nconsideration in terms of this order. The appointment of the\nlearned Sole Arbitrator by the respondents is non-est.\n\n31. The present petition is liable to be allowed. I appoint\nJustice S.P.

The fee of the learned sole\nArbitrator shall be governed by\nFourth Schedule to the Arbitration\n& Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\n32. The petition is disposed of.\n\n33.
