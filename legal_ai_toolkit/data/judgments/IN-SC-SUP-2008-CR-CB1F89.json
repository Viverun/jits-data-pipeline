Singhvi\n,\nAltamas Kabir\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\n\nCRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO.1239 OF 2003\n\nDinesh Seth ........Appellant\n\nVersus\n\nState of N.C.T. of Delhi ........Respondent\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nG.S. Singhvi, J.\n\n1. This appeal is directed against the judgment of Delhi High Court\n\nwhereby the appellant was acquitted of the charge under\nSection 304B\n\nIndian Penal Code (for short `\nIPC\n') but was convicted under\nSection 498A\n\nIPC and sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment.\n\n2. The facts\n\n(i) The appellant was married to Rama on 2.12.1984. She died on\n\n22.11.1986. On receipt of an anonymous call/information that son of\n\nKuldeep Seth (the appellant herein) has murdered his wife in his\n\nhouse situated at Gali No.8, Multani Dhanda, Paharganj. Shri C.L.\n\nJatav, Sub-Inspector of Police visited the spot and found the dead\nbody of Rama in a room on the second floor of the house. He also\n\nfound one piece of printed cloth (chunni) near the dead body and\n\nanother piece which was tied with the ceiling fan. Shri Naresh\n\nTandon, brother-in-law of the deceased who was present at the site\n\ntold Shri Jatav that the deceased had been subjected to harassment\n\nand torture by her husband and in-laws. The Sub-Divisional\n\nMagistrate recorded the statement of Smt. Raj Rani Mehra (mother of\n\nthe deceased), who had also reached the house of the appellant and on\n\nthat basis a case was registered under\nSections 304B\n/\n/\n498A\nread\n\nwith\nSection 34\nIPC. On the next day, Dr. Bharat Singh (PW-21)\n\nconducted post mortem. He found the following injuries on the body\n\nof the deceased:-\n\n1. One ligature mark around the neck placed above the\nthyroid cartilage which was present all around the neck.\n\nThe width of the ligature was >\" all along except near\nthe right side of the ear where it was irregular and was\nwider upto 1\". Base was depressed. Skin was abraded.\nColour was light brown.\n\n2. One lenier abrasion was present on the right knee joint\nsize two and half inches x two and ten inches.\n\nDr. Bharat Singh opined that the cause of death was asphyxia\n\ncaused due to hanging.\n(ii) The police submitted challan under\nSections 304B\n/\n/\n498A\nread\n\nwith\nSection 34\nIPC against the appellant, his brothers Suresh Seth\n\nand Naresh Seth and mother Janak Seth. The learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge framed charge under\nSection 304B\nread with\nSection\nIPC. The prosecution examined as many as 26 witnesses\n\nincluding the mother of the deceased, Smt. Raj Rani Mehra (PW-7),\n\nher sisters and brother, Smt. Radha Mehra (PW-1), Ms. Chitra Mehra\n\n(PW-6) and Chaman Mehra (PW-26), two neighbours, namely Rajesh\n\n(PW-19) and Amit Grover (PW-24), Investigating Officer C.L. Jatav\n\n(PW-20) and Dr. Bharat Singh (PW-21). In their statements under\n\nSection 313\nCode of Criminal Procedure (for short `the Code'), all the\n\naccused denied their involvement in the death of Rama. They also\n\ndenied the allegation of having subjected the deceased to harassment\n\nand torture for dowry.\n\n(iii) The trial court convicted all the accused under\nSection 304B\nread\n\nwith\nSection 34\nIPC and sentenced them to seven years' rigorous\n\nimprisonment. On appeal, the High Court held that charge under\n\nSection 304B\nIPC is not made out and acquitted all the accused.\n\nHowever, the appellant was found guilty under\nSection 498A\nIPC and\n\nsentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment.\n3. Shri K.T.S. Tulsi, senior counsel appearing for the appellant, assailed\n\nthe impugned judgment on two counts. He argued that the appellant's\n\nconviction under\nSection 498A\nIPC is liable to be set aside because he was\n\ntried for an offence under\nSection 304B\nread with 34\nIPC\nand not under\n\nSection 498A\nIPC. Learned senior counsel submitted that in the absence of\n\na specific charge under\nSection 498A\nIPC, the High Court could not have\n\nconvicted the appellant under that section because he did not get\n\nopportunity to defend himself. Shri Tulsi further argued that after having\n\ndiscarded the testimony of PW-1, PW-6 and PW-7 on the issue of\n\nharassment, cruelty and demand of dowry and acquitted the appellant of the\n\ncharge under\nSection 304B\nIPC, the High Court could not have relied upon\n\nthe same evidence for the purpose of convicting him under\nSection 498A\n\nIPC.\nIn support of his arguments, Shri Tulsi referred to the judgments of this\n\nCourt in\nState of West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal & Another\n[1994 (1)\n\nSCC 73],Himachal Pradesh Admn.\nvs. Shri Om Prakash [1972 (2) SCR\n\n765], Ramakant Rai vs. Madan Rai & Others [JT 2003 (Supp.2) SC\n\n344], Gokaraju Venkatanarasa Raju vs. State of A.P. [1993 Supp.\n(\n4)\n\nSCC 191] and Shivanand Mallappa Koti vs. State of Karnataka\n[2007\n\n(8) Scale 408].\n\nLearned senior counsel then submitted that the judgments of\n\nthis Court in\nPyare Lal vs. State of Haryana\n[1997 (11) SCC 552] and\nSatpal vs. State of Haryana [1998 (5) SCC 687] on which reliance has\n\nbeen placed by the High Court for convicting the appellant under\nSection\n\n498A\nIPC are clearly distinguishable because in neither of those cases\n\nquestion similar to the one arising in this appeal was considered.\n\n4. Shri P.P. Malhotra, senior counsel representing the State relied upon\n\nthe provisions of\nSections 221\n,\nand\nof the Code and argued that\n\nomission to frame specific charge under\nSection 498A\nIPC cannot be made\n\na ground for acquittal of the appellant because absence of charge under that\n\nsection did not prejudice his defence and no failure of justice was\n\noccasioned. Shri Malhotra submitted that the evidence produced by the\n\nprosecution was sufficient to prove that the appellant had subjected the\n\ndeceased to cruelty and the High Court did not commit any error by\n\nconvicting him under\nSection 498A\nIPC.\n\n5. We have considered the respective submissions. For deciding whether\n\nthe High Court committed an illegality by convicting the appellant under\n\nSection 498A\nIPC, it will be useful to notice the provisions of\nSections 221\n,\nand\nof the Code. The same read as under:-\n\n221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed.\n\n(1) If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that\nit is doubtful which of several offences the facts which\ncan be proved will constitute, the accused may be\ncharged with having committed all or any of such\noffences, and any number of such charges may be tried at\nonce; or he may be charged in the alternative with having\ncommitted some one of the said offences.\n\n(2) If in such a case the accused is charged with one\noffence, and it appears in evidence that he committed a\ndifferent offence for which he might have been charged\nunder the provisions of sub-section (1), he may be\nconvicted of the offence which he is shown to have\ncommitted, although he was not charged with it.\n\nIllustrations (a) A is accused of an act which may\namount to theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal\nbreach of trust or cheating. He may be charged with\ntheft, receiving stolen property, criminal breach of trust\nand cheating, or he may be charged with having\ncommitted theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal\nbreach of trust or cheating.\n\n(b) In the case mentioned, A is only charged with theft. It\nappears that he committed the offence of criminal breach\nof trust, or that of receiving stolen goods. He may be\nconvicted of criminal breach of trust or of receiving\nstolen goods (as the case may be), though he was not\ncharged with such offence.\n(c) A states on oath before the Magistrate that he saw B\nhit C with a club. Before the Sessions Court A states on\noath that B never hit C. A may be charged in the\nalternative and convicted of intentionally giving false\nevidence, although it cannot to be proved which of these\ncontradictory statements was false.\n\n222. When offence proved included in offence charged.\n\n(1) When a person is charged with an offence consisting\nof several particulars, a combination of some only of\nwhich constitutes a complete minor offence, and such\ncombination is proved, but the remaining particulars are\nnot proved, he may be convicted of the minor offence\nthough he was not charged with it.\n\n(2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts\nare proved which reduce it to a minor offence, he may be\nconvicted of the minor offence, although he is not\ncharged with it.\n\n(3) When a person is charged with an offence, he may\nbe convicted of an attempt to commit such offence\nalthough the attempt is not separately charged.\n\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise\na conviction of any minor offence where the conditions\nrequisite for the initiation of proceedings in respect of\nthat minor offence have not been satisfied.\nIllustrations (a) A is charged, under\nsection 407\nof the\nIndian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with criminal breach of\ntrust in respect of property entrusted to him as a carrier.\nIt appears, that he did commit criminal breach of trust\nunder\nsection 406\nof that Code in respect of the property,\nbut that it was not entrusted to him as a carrier. He may\nbe convicted of criminal breach of trust under the said\n\nsection 406\n.\n\n(b) A is charged under\nsection 325\nof the Indian Penal\nCode (45 of 1860), with causing grievous hurt. He\nproves that he acted on grave and sudden provocation.\nHe may be convicted under\nsection 335\nof that Code.\n\n464. Effect of omission to frame, or absence of, or error in,\ncharge. (1) No finding, sentence or order by a Court of\ncompetent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on\nthe ground that no charge was framed or on the ground\nof any error, omission or irregularity in the charge\nincluding any misjoinder of charges, unless, in the\nopinion of the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision,\na failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.\n\n(2) If the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision is of\nopinion that a failure of justice has in fact been\noccasioned, it may- (a) in the case of an omission to\nframe a charge, order that a charge be framed and that\nthe trial be recommended from the point immediately\nafter the framing of the charge.\n(b) in the case of an error, omission or irregularity in the\ncharge, direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed\nin whatever manner it thinks fit:\n\nProvided that if the Court is of opinion that the\nfacts of the case are such that no valid charge could be\npreferred against the accused in respect of the facts\nproved, it shall quash the conviction.\n\n6. A reading of the plain language of\nSection 221(1)\nand (2) shows that\n\nif a single act or series of acts constitute several offences and the\n\nprosecution is not certain about the particular offence then the accused can\n\nbe charged with the allegation of having committed all, some or any of the\n\noffences. In such a case the accused can be convicted of the offence with\n\nwhich he may not have been specifically charged but evidence produced by\n\nthe prosecution proves that such an offence has, in fact, been committed.\n\nSection 222(1)\nlays down that when a person is charged with an offence\n\nconsisting of several particulars and combination of only some of the\n\nparticulars constituting a minor offence is proved then he can be convicted\n\nof the minor offence with which he may not have been charged.\nSection\n\n222(2)\nlays down that when a person is charged with an offence but the\n\nfacts proved constitute a minor offence then he can be convicted of the\n\nminor offence despite the fact that he may not have been charged with that\n\noffence. Sub-section (3) of\nSection 222\nlays down that a person charged\nwith an offence, can be convicted of an attempt to commit such offence\n\neven though a separate charge may not have been framed on that account.\n\nSection 464\nlays down that any error, omission or irregularity in the framing\n\nof charge including any misjoinder of charges, will not invalidate a finding,\n\nsentence or order by a court of competent jurisdiction unless the higher\n\ncourt comes to a conclusion that failure of justice has been occasioned.\n\nSub-section (2) of\nSection 464\nspecifies the modes which can be adopted by\n\nthe Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, if such court is of the opinion\n\nthat a failure of the justice has been occasioned on account of non framing\n\nof charge or any error, omission or irregularity in the framing of charge.\n\n7. The question whether omission to frame a charge or any error or\n\nirregularity in the charge, is by itself, sufficient for quashing the conviction\n\nof the accused was considered in\nWillie (William) Slaney vs. State of M.P.\n\n[AIR 1956 SC 116]. After examining the issue in detail, the Constitution\n\nBench of this Court observed:-\n\n\"Before we proceed to set out our answer and examine the\nprovisions of the Code, we will pause to observe that the Code\nis a code of procedure and, like all procedural laws, is designed\nto further the ends of justice and not to frustrate them by the\nintroduction of endless technicalities. The object of the Code is\nto ensure that an accused person gets a full and fair trial along\ncertain well-established and well-understood lines that accord\nwith our notions of natural justice.\n\nIf he does, if he is tried by a competent court, if he is told\nand clearly understands the nature of the offence for which he\nis being tried, if the case against him is fully and fairly\nexplained to him and he is afforded a full and fair opportunity\nof defending himself, then, provided there is `substantial'\ncompliance with the outward forms of the law, mere mistakes\nin procedure, mere inconsequential errors and omissions in the\ntrial are regarded as venal by the Code and the trial is not\nvitiated unless the accused can show substantial prejudice.\nThat, broadly speaking, is the basic principle on which the\nCode is based.\n\nNow here, as in all procedural laws, certain things are\nregarded as vital. Disregard of a provision of that nature is fatal\nto the trial and at once invalidates the conviction. Others are\nnot vital and whatever the irregularity they can be cured; and in\nthat event the conviction must stand unless the Court is\nsatisfied that there was prejudice. Some of these matters are\ndealt with by the Code and wherever that is the case full effect\nmust be given to its provisions.\"\n\n8. The Constitution Bench then referred to the provisions of\nSections\n,\n,\nand\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which are\n\nanalogous to\nSection 215\n,\nand\nof the Code and held:\n\n\"Now, as we have said,\nSections 225\n,\n, 535 and 537(a)\nbetween them, cover every conceivable type of error and\nirregularity referable to a charge that can possibly arise,\nranging from cases in which there is a conviction with no\ncharge at all from start to finish down to cases in which there is\na charge but with errors, irregularities and omissions in it. The\nCode is emphatic that `whatever' the irregularity it is not to be\nregarded as fatal unless there is prejudice.\n\nIt is the substance that we must seek. Courts have to\nadminister justice and justice includes the punishment of guilt\njust as much as the protection of innocence. Neither can be\ndone if the shadow is mistaken for the substance and the goal is\nlost in a labyrinth of unsubstantial technicalities. Broad vision\nis required, a nice balancing of the rights of the State and the\nprotection of society in general against protection from\nharassment to the individual and the risks of unjust conviction.\n\nEvery reasonable presumption must be made in favour of\nan accused person; he must be given the benefit of every\nreasonable doubt. The same broad principles of justice and fair\nplay must be brought to bear when determining a matter of\nprejudice as in adjudging guilt. But when all is said and done\nwhat we are concerned to see is whether the accused had a fair\ntrial, whether he knew what he was being tried for, whether the\nmain facts sought to be established against him were explained\nto him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and\nfair chance to defend himself.\n\nIf all these elements are there and no prejudice is shown\nthe conviction must stand whatever the irregularities whether\ntraceable to the charge or to a want of one.\"\n9.\nIn\nGurbachan Singh vs. State of Punjab\n[AIR 1957 SC 623], a\n\nthree Judges' Bench considered the question of prejudice and observed:\n\n\"In judging a question of prejudice, as of guilt, courts must act\nwith a broad vision and look to the substance and not to\ntechnicalities, and their main concern should be to see whether\nthe accused had a fair trial, whether he knew what he was being\ntried for, whether the main facts sought to be established\nagainst him were explained to him fairly and clearly and\nwhether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself.\"\n\n10.\nIn\nLakhjit Singh vs. State of Punjab\n[1994 Supp. (1) SCC 173], the\n\naccused were charged and convicted of offence under\nSection 302\nIPC. The\n\nHigh Court upheld their conviction. A two Judges' Bench of this Court\n\nheld that charge under\nSection 302\nIPC is not established but convicted the\n\nappellants under\nSection 306\nIPC. While rejecting the argument that in the\n\nabsence of a specific charge under\nSection 306\nIPC, the appellants cannot\n\nbe convicted under that section, the Court observed:-\n\n\"The learned counsel, however, submits that since the charge\nwas for the offence punishable under\nSection 302\nIndian Penal\nCode, the accused were not put to notice to meet a charge also\nmade against them under\nSection 306\nIPC and, therefore, they\nare prejudiced by not framing a charge under\nSection 306\n\nIndian Penal Code and; therefore, presumption under\nSection\n113-A\nof Indian Evidence Act cannot be drawn and\nconsequently a conviction under Section 306 cannot be\nawarded. We are unable to agree. The facts and circumstances\nof the case have been put forward against the accused under\n\nSection 313\nCrPC and when there was a demand for dowry it\ncannot be said that the accused are prejudiced because the\ncross-examination of the witnesses, as well as the answers\ngiven under\nSection 313\nCrPC would show that they had\nenough of notice of the allegations which attract\nSection 306\n\nIndian Penal Code also.\"\n\n11.\nIn\nSangaraboina Sreenu vs. State of A.P.\n[1997 (5) SCC 348],\n\nanother Bench of two Judges' expressed a contrary view. The facts of that\n\ncase were that the accused was convicted by the trial court under\nSection\nIPC. The High Court converted the conviction to one under\nSection\nIPC. While reversing the judgment of the High Court, this Court held:\n\n\"This appeal must succeed for the simple reason that having\nacquitted the appellant of the charge under\nSection 302\nIPC --\nwhich was the only charge framed against him -- the High\nCourt could not have convicted him of the offence under\n\nSection 306\nIPC. It is true that\nSection 222\nCrPC entitles a\ncourt to convict a person of an offence which is minor in\ncomparison to the one for which he is tried but\nSection 306\nIPC\ncannot be said to be a minor offence in relation to an offence\nunder\nSection 302\nIPC within the meaning of\nSection 222\n\nCrPC for the two offences are of distinct and different\ncategories. While the basic constituent of an offence under\n\nSection 302\nIPC is homicidal death, those of\nSection 306\nIPC\nare suicidal death and abetment thereof.\"\n12. In view of the apparently conflicting judgments of the coordinate\n\nBenches, the issue was referred to a larger Bench.\nIn\nDalbir Singh vs.\n\nState of U.P.\n[2004 (5) SCC 334], a three Judges' Bench considered the\n\nprovisions of Section 222 and 464 of the Code and observed:-\n\n\"Sub-section (1) of Section 222 lays down that when a person\nis charged with an offence consisting of several particulars, a\ncombination of some only of which constitutes a complete\nminor offence, and such combination is proved, but the\nremaining particulars are not proved, he may be convicted of\nthe minor offence, though he was not charged with it. Sub-\nsection (2) of the same section lays down that when a person is\ncharged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to\na minor offence, he may be convicted of the minor offence,\nalthough he is not charged with it.\nSection 222\nCrPC is in the\nnature of a general provision which empowers the court to\nconvict for a minor offence even though charge has been\nframed for a major offence. Illustrations (a) and (b) to the said\nsection also make the position clear. However, there is a\nseparate chapter in the\nCode of Criminal Procedure\n, namely,\nChapter XXXV which deals with irregular proceedings and\ntheir effect. This chapter enumerates various kinds of\nirregularities which have the effect of either vitiating or not\nvitiating the proceedings. Section 464 of the Code deals with\nthe effect of omission to frame, or absence of, or error in,\ncharge. Sub-section (1) of this section provides that no finding,\nsentence or order by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be\ndeemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was\nframed or on the ground of any error, omission or irregularity\nin the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in\nthe opinion of the court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a\nfailure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby. This\nclearly shows that any error, omission or irregularity in the\ncharge including any misjoinder of charges shall not result in\ninvalidating the conviction or order of a competent court unless\nthe appellate or revisional court comes to the conclusion that a\nfailure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby.\"\n\n13. The three Judges' Bench then referred to the earlier judgments in\n\nWillie (William) Slaney vs. State of M.P.\n(supra), Gurbachan Singh vs.\n\nState of Punjab (supra) and observed:-\n\n\"There is a catena of decisions of this Court on the same lines\nand it is not necessary to burden this judgment by making\nreference to each one of them. Therefore, in view of\nSection\nCrPC, it is possible for the appellate or revisional court to\nconvict an accused for an offence for which no charge was\nframed unless the court is of the opinion that a failure of justice\nwould in fact occasion. In order to judge whether a failure of\njustice has been occasioned, it will be relevant to examine\nwhether the accused was aware of the basic ingredients of the\noffence for which he is being convicted and whether the main\nfacts sought to be established against him were explained to\nhim clearly and whether he got a fair chance to defend himself.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that Sangaraboina Sreenu\nwas not correctly decided as it purports to lay down as a\nprinciple of law that where the accused is charged under\n\nSection 302\nIPC, he cannot be convicted for the offence under\n\nSection 306\nIPC.\"\n\n14. The ratio of the above noted judgments is that in certain situations an\n\naccused can be convicted of an offence with which he may not have been\n\nspecifically charged and that an error, omission or irregularity in the\n\nframing of charge is, by itself not sufficient for upsetting the conviction.\n\nThe appellate, confirming or revisional Court can interfere in such matters\n\nonly if it is shown that error, omission or irregularity in the framing of\n\ncharge has caused prejudice to the accused and failure of justice has been\n\noccasioned.\n\n15. Reverting to the facts of this case, we find that the appellant and his\n\nco-accused were charged under\nSection 304B\nIPC. The specific allegation\n\nlevelled against them was that they had subjected the deceased to cruelty for\n\nor in connection with demand for dowry and she had died unnatural death\n\nwithin seven years of her marriage. Thus, the appellant knew that he was to\n\ndefend himself against the allegation of cruelty. The cross-examination of\n\nprosecution witnesses unmistakably shows that the defense had made\n\nconcerted effort to discredit the testimony of mother, sisters and brother of\nthe deceased in the context of allegation of cruelty. Not only this in his\n\nstatement under Section 313 of the Code, the appellant denied the allegation\n\nthat he had subjected his wife to cruelty. It is thus evident that the appellant\n\nwas not only aware of the charge of cruelty but he got and availed the\n\nopportunity to defend himself with reference to that charge. Therefore, it is\n\nnot possible to accept the submission of Shri Tulsi that omission of the trial\n\ncourt to frame specific charge under\nSection 498A\nIPC had prejudiced the\n\ncause of his client or that failure of justice had been occasioned on that\n\ncount.\n\n16. The next point which requires consideration is whether after\n\ndiscarding the testimony of PW-1, PW-6 and PW-7 and acquitting the\n\nappellant of the charge under\nSection 304B\nIPC, the High Court could\n\nconvict him under\nSection 498A\nIPC.\n\n17. Section 498A was added to the\nIPC\nby amending Act No.46 of 1983\n\nin the backdrop of growing menace of dowry related cases in which the\n\nwomen were subjected to cruelty and harassment and were forced to commit\n\nsuicide. This section lays down that if the husband or his relative subjects a\n\nwoman to cruelty, then he/she is liable to be punished with imprisonment\n\nfor a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nExplanation appended to this section defines the term `cruelty' to mean any\nwillful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the woman to\n\ncommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb or health\n\n(whether mental or physical) of the woman; or harassment of the woman\n\nwhere such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any person related\n\nto her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or\n\nis on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such\n\ndemand.\n\n18. After three years, Section 304B was inserted by amending Act No.43\n\nof 1986 to deal with cases involving dowry deaths occurring within seven\n\nyears of marriage. Sub-section (1) of\nSection 304B\nIPC lays down that\n\nwhere the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or\n\noccurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her\n\nmarriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to\n\ncruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or\n\nin connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called\n\n`dowry death', and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused\n\nher death. By virtue of explanation appearing below sub-section (1), the\n\nword `dowry' used therein carries the same meaning as is contained in\n\nSection 2\nof The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.\n19. The ingredient of cruelty is common to\nSections 304B\nand\n498A\nIPC,\n\nbut the width and scope of two sections is different, inasmuch as Section\n\n304B deals with cases of death as a result of cruelty or harassment within\n\nseven years of marriage, Section 498A has a wider spectrum and it covers\n\nall cases in which the wife is subjected to cruelty by her husband or relative\n\nof the husband which may result in death by way of suicide or cause grave\n\ninjury or danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) or even\n\nharassment caused with a view to coerce the woman or any person related to\n\nher to meet unlawful demand for property or valuable security.\n\n20. In order to bring home charge under\nSection 304B\nIPC, the\n\nprosecution is required to establish that the death of the woman has been\n\ncaused by burns or bodily injury or otherwise than under normal\n\ncircumstances within seven years of her marriage and soon before her death,\n\nthe woman is subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his\n\nrelative. However, for the purpose of conviction under\nSection 498A\nIPC, it\n\nis sufficient to prove that the woman was subjected to cruelty, as elucidated\n\nin the explanation appearing below substantive part of the section, by her\n\nhusband or his relative.\n\n21. A reading of the impugned judgment shows that after recording a\n\nfinding that there was no evidence to prove that the deceased was treated\nwith cruelty or harassment in connection with demand of dowry soon before\n\nher death, the High Court referred to the judgments of this Court in\nPyare\n\nLal vs. State of Haryana\n(supra) and Satpal vs. State of Haryana (supra)\n\nand held that evidence on record clearly makes out an offence under\nSection\n\n498A\nIPC against the appellant.\n\n22. Although the judgment under challenge does not contain an elaborate\n\ndiscussion with reference to the ingredients of\nSection 498A\nIPC, having\n\ncarefully gone through the statements of PW-1, PW-6, PW-7, PW-14 and\n\nPW-26, we are convinced that the prosecution succeeded in proving that the\n\nappellant had subjected the deceased to cruelty within the meaning of clause\n\n(a) of explanation appearing below\nSection 498A\nIPC and the mere fact that\n\nthe statements of three of them were not found convincing by the High\n\nCourt for sustaining the conviction of the appellant and his other co-accused\n\non the premise that all the ingredients of\nSection 304B\nIPC have not been\n\nestablished is not sufficient to discard the prosecution case as a whole. PW-\n\n1, PW-6 (both sisters), PW-7 (mother) and PW-26 (brother) have\n\ncategorically deposed that immediately after marriage the deceased was\n\ngiven beating by the appellant, his brothers and was subjected to harassment\n\nand taunting by mother-in-law and sister-in-law for being dark\ncomplexioned and illiterate/not fluent in English. Their statements also\n\nshow that the appellant had hit the deceased with a brick resulting in wound\n\non her head which had to be stitched. On the date of death also, the\n\ndeceased was subjected to physical torture and harassment. Both the sisters\n\nnarrated that when they met the deceased, she was weeping and her eyes\n\nwere swollen. Their testimony has been substantially supported by PW-14\n\nRakesh Malhotra. He too stated that the deceased was subjected to beating\n\nby her husband and she had suffered injury on her head. This part of the\n\nprosecution case has not been disbelieved by the High Court which found\n\ndiscrepancy only on the issue of demand of dowry. The beating given to the\n\ndeceased and harassment to which she was subjected had direct bearing on\n\nher committing suicide. Therefore, we are convinced that the High Court\n\ndid not commit any error in convicting the appellant under\nSection 498A\n\nIPC.\n\n23. The judgments on which Shri Tulsi has placed reliance do not support\n\nthe cause of the appellant. Rather, the judgment in\nState of West Bengal\n\nvs. Orilal Jaiswal & Another\n(supra) supports the conclusion that an\n\noffence under\nSection 498A\nIPC is made out if the woman is subjected to\n\nphysical assault, humiliation, harassment and mental torture.\n\nIn\nSatpal vs.\n\nState of Haryana\n(supra), this Court held that even though the prosecution\n\nevidence was not sufficient to establish charge under Section 304 or 306\nIPC\n, conviction under\nSection 498A\nIPC can be upheld because the\n\ndeceased was treated with cruelty by the appellant.\n\n24. In the result, the appeal is dismissed. The appellant who is on bail,\n\nshall be arrested for serving out the remaining sentence.\n\n.........................
