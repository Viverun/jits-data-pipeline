Nos.1042 of 2021 & 1241 of 2021\n [arising out of the impugned judgment dated 24.06.2021 in W.P.(C) No.10135/2021]\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n Dated this the 6th day of April, 2022\n\n JUDGMENT\n\nAlexander Thomas, J.\n\n Since both these intra court appeals have arisen out of the\n\nvery same impugned common judgment dated 24.06.2021,\n\nrendered by the learned Single Judge, in the instant W.P.(C)\n\nNo.10135/2021, hence these appeals are disposed of on the basis\n\nof this common judgment.\n\n 2. Heard Sri. P. B. Krishnan, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellant in W.A.No.1042/2021, Sri. V. V. Nandagopal\n\nNambiar, learned Standing Counsel and Sri.P.C. Sasidharan,\n\nlearned Advocate, both appearing for the appellant in\n\nW.A.No.1241/2021, Sri. K. Jaju Babu, learned Senior Counsel,\n\ninstructed by Sri. Brijesh Mohan, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor respondents 1 to 3 in both the appeals/writ petitioners,\n\nSri. Antony Mukkath, learned Senior Government Pleader,\n\nappearing for the respondent State Government in these cases,\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..2..\n\nand Sri. T. K. Vipindas, the learned Standing Counsel for the\n\nrespondent Guruvayur Devaswom Board, appearing in these cases.\n\n 3. The prayers in the instant W.P.(C)No.10135/2021 are\n\nas follows:-\n\n \"i. issue a writ of mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order\n or direction, directing the respondents 2 and 3 to promote the\n petitioners as Manager in accordance with \nRegulation 16\n of\n the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations 1983 as per\n Ext.P1 forthwith.\n\n ii. issue a writ of certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order\n or direction, calling for Ext.P6 and quash the same to the\n extent respondents 6 to 11 are selected for promotion to the\n post of Manager in supersession to the petitioners.\n\n iii. Declare that the selection to the post of Manager as per Ext.P6\n is illegal and in clear violation to \nRegulation 16\n of Ext.P1\n Regulations and thereby unsustainable.\n\n iv. Declare that Ext.P7 and P9 are illegal and ultravirus the\n provisions of Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act and\n Guruvayur Devaswom Act 1978 as well as Ext.P1 Regulations\n and thereby inapplicable in the matter of promotions under the\n Guruvayur Devaswom.\n\n v. issue a writ of certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order\n or direction, calling for Ext.P7 and P9 and quash the directions\n contained therein in respect of promotions in Guruvayur\n Devaswom governed by Ext.P1 Guruvayur Devaswom\n Employees Regulations 1983.\n\n vi. issue a writ of certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order\n or direction, calling for the records leading to Ext.P6 and\n quash the all selection to the post of Manager.\n\n vii. issue such other and further reliefs as this Honourable Court\n may deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of the\n case;\n\n and\n\n viii. award costs to the petitioners.\"\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..3..\n\n 4. The case set up in the W.P.(C) is broadly as follows:-\n\nThat, the three writ petitioners (contesting respondents 1 to 3 in\n\nboth the appeals) are holding the post of Assistant Managers in the\n\nrespondent Guruvayur Devaswom Board, their probation in the\n\ncadre of Assistant Managers have been duly declared and that they\n\nhave all the eligibility conditions including passing of obligatory\n\ntest qualifications for being considered for promotion to the next\n\nhigher category post of Manager. That, the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nEmployees Regulations, 1983, have been statutorily framed under\n\nSection 39\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978, with the prior\n\napproval of the State Government at Ext.P1. That, \nRegulation 16\n\nthereof deals with promotion, which reads as follows:-\n\n \"\nRegulation 16\n. Promotion:-\n\n (a) Probationers working in any post shall be eligible for\n promotion to a higher post as per provisions applicable to employees of\n State Government.\n\n (b) All promotions or appointments by transfer, shall, subject to the\n provisions of these regulation, be made by the Administrator after\n obtaining approval of the managing Committee in accordance with\n seniority subject to the persons being considered suitable for the post.\"\n\n 5. That, as per the \nRegulation 4\n, the appointing authority\n\nfor all the posts in the Guruvayur Devaswom Service shall be the\n\nManaging Committee. That, on account of the insistence of the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..4..\n\nrespondent State Government and the respondent Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board, promotion to the post of Manager\n\nwas unlawfully taken over by the Departmental Promotion\n\nCommittee (DPC), said to have been constituted under the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015. Further that the said\n\nDPC, without considering the confidential records for all the three\n\nprevious years in question and by placing reliance on adverse\n\nentries which are uncommunicated to the writ petitioners, have\n\nchosen to deny them promotions. Further that confidential\n\nrecords for only the year 2020 has been taken into account.\n\nFurther that, the said stand has been taken by the respondent-\n\nRecruitment Board on the premise that appointments to all the\n\nposts in the Guruvayur Devaswom Service other than the\n\nhereditary posts, etc. can be made only at the instance of the said\n\nrecruitment Board. The said stand of the Recruitment Board is\n\nillegal and ultravires, inasmuch as the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015, confers jurisdiction to the said\n\nRecruitment Board only for making selection list for direct\n\nrecruitment to the various posts in the Guruvayur Devaswom\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..5..\n\nService other than the hereditary posts, etc. That, Ext.P6 is the\n\nminutes of the DPC, constituted under the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, forwarded by the 5th respondent in the\n\nW.P.(C) (DPC) to the 3rd respondent (Administrator, Guruvayur\n\nDevaswom Managing Committee) and that the said proceedings of\n\nthe DPC is liable to be quashed. That, the sole authority to\n\nconsider the promotions of the writ petitioners to the post of\n\nManager is the respondent Guruvayur Devaswom Managing\n\nCommittee so long as regulations 4 & 16 of the Guruvayur\n\nDevaswom Employees Regulation, 1983, are not statutorily\n\namended in the manner known to law. That, the said regulations\n\nhave not been amended. Therefore the present impugned\n\nproceedings of the DPC, constituted under the Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act at Ext.P6, is ultravires the provisions\n\ncontained in the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015\n\nand the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Rules, 2015, etc.\n\nDuring the pendency of the W.P.(C), the writ petitioners have\n\nproduced additional documents as per Exts.P10 to P14 in the W.P.\n\n(C) along with I.A.No.5/2021 in the above W.P.(C). It is averred in\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..6..\n\nthe affidavit filed along with the said I.A. that later all issues were\n\nconsidered by the Managing Committee of the respondent\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Board, in the meeting held on 26.04.2021,\n\nall the members of the Managing Committee, except the Chairman\n\nhave resolved to reject the recommendation contained in Ext.P6\n\nand give promotions to employees who joined Devaswom service\n\nprior to 2015, in accordance with the abovesaid Regulations and\n\nthat Ext.P13 is the copy of the decision rendered on 26.04.2021 by\n\nthe respondent Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee.\n\n 6. Per contra, the contention of the respondent\n\nRecruitment Board and the respondent State Government is that\n\non and with effect from 01.03.2014, (the date of coming into force\n\nof the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015), by virtue of\n\nthe non- obstante clause contained in \nSection 9(1)(i)\n of the said\n\nAct, notwithstanding anything contained in any other existing Act\n\nor Rules or Regulations or orders or judgment or decree in respect\n\nof the appointment of candidates to the posts in the Devaswom\n\nBoard, the Board shall prepare select list for the appointment of\n\ncandidates to various posts other than the heriditary posts and\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..7..\n\nposts in the aided educational institutions in the Devaswom Boards\n\nas per the provisions of the said Act, Rules and Regulations, etc.\n\nHence, it has been contended by them that, appointments to all the\n\nposts in various Devaswoms, including the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nBoard, can be effectuated only in accordance with the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and that even promotions\n\nto the instant post of Manager can be made only through the\n\nDepartmental Promotion Committee, constituted as per the Rules\n\nframed under the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015,\n\netc.\n\n 7. The learned Single Judge, after hearing both sides, has\n\nnoted the specific submission made on behalf of the writ\n\npetitioners that, subsequently, by Ext.P13 proceedings dated\n\n26.04.2021, the decision has been taken by the respondent\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee to reject the\n\nrecommendations of the DPC at Ext.P6, to make promotions on\n\nthe basis of the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations,\n\n1983 and also to inform the Chairman of the respondent\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board, accordingly, etc., though a dissent\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..8..\n\nhas been recorded therein on behalf of the Chairperson of the\n\nCommittee. The learned Single Judge also noted the contention of\n\nthe writ petitioners that, since Ext.P13 decision has been taken by\n\nthe Managing Committee on the basis of majority, the same will\n\nhave to be implemented.\n\n 8. Per contra, the learned Standing Counsel for the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Board submitted that, it may be true that,\n\nExt.P13 decision has been taken by the Managing Committee on\n\n26.04.2021, but since it has been issued on the basis of majority,\n\nthe same will necessarily have to be implemented as per law and\n\nthat as it can be enforced only as per law, Ext.P13 has been\n\nforwarded to the respondent Devaswom Recruitment Board for\n\nfurther action. Whereas the learned Standing Counsel for the\n\nrespondent Devaswom Recruitment Board submitted that, if the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Board has forwarded all the relevant and\n\nnecessary papers, like the recruitment papers, to the recruitment\n\nBoard, then they will apposite steps for implementation of the\n\nsame, following the Kerala Devaswom Board Recruitment Rules.\n\n 9. The learned Single Judge has, in paragraph No.5 of the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..9..\n\nimpugned judgment, noted that the Managing Committee of the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Board has taken a decision, as per Ext.P13,\n\nto effect promotion, based on the 1983 Regulations and that all\n\nfurther actions, based on Ext.P13 resolution, will be within the\n\nliberty of the respondent Guruvayur Devaswom Board to forward\n\nas per law. The learned Single Judge, as per the impugned\n\njudgment rendered on 24.06.2021, has thus finally disposed of the\n\ninstant W.P.(C) No.10135/2021, as per paragraph No.6 thereof,\n\nthat there is no necessity for the Court to consider any of the rival\n\ncontentions impelled in the case at this stage, since it is upto the\n\nrespondent Devaswom Board to now implement Ext.P13 decision\n\nas per law. Hence, the learned Single Judge, as per the impugned\n\njudgment, has ordered that the submission that, Ext.P13 resolution\n\nhas been adopted by the Managing Committee of the Devaswom\n\nBoard, has been recorded and the Devaswom Board has been\n\ngranted liberty to implement it, in the manner and following the\n\nprocedure applicable, etc.\n\n 10. Later, the writ petitioners have instituted a contempt of\n\nCourt proceedings as CoC No.1081/2021 (arising out of the above\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..10..\n\njudgment in W.P.(C) No.10135/2021), before the learned Single\n\nJudge. The learned Single Judge has rendered the judgment on\n\n30.07.2021 disposing of the abovesaid CoC No.1081/2021 by\n\nholding in paragraph No.8 thereof that the abovesaid impugned\n\njudgment in the W.P.(C) has not given any affirmative directions\n\ntherein and that the only liberty that had been granted to the\n\nrespondent Guruvayur Devaswom Board is to take action as per\n\nExt.P13 resolution as it is legally permissible and after recording\n\nthe decision of the respondent Devaswom Board that they have\n\nentrusted the matter with the 1st respondent therein (Administrator\n\nof the Guruvayur Devaswom Board) to comply with the directions\n\nof this Court as per the impugned judgment in the W.P.(C). The\n\nlearned Single Judge has noted in paragraph No.9 of the judgment\n\nof the Contempt Case that what has been done as per the\n\nimpugned Ext.P13 proceedings dated 26.04.2021 by the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee is that the\n\nrecommendations of the DPC at Ext.P6 have been rejected and\n\nfurther that a decision has been taken in Ext.P13 that employees in\n\nthe Guruvayur Devaswom Board, who have entered into service\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..11..\n\nprior to 2015, be granted promotion as per the Guruvayur\n\nDevaswom Employees Regulations, 1983. The learned Single\n\nJudge has closed the said Contempt of Court Case granting liberty\n\nto the petitioners to move the Managing Committee of the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Board, appropriately, based on Annexure-C\n\ntherein (Resolution No.2 dated 01.07.2021, issued by the\n\nAdministrator), in which event the said authority is left with the\n\nliberty to take appropriate action as they are advised in terms of\n\nlaw and after following the due procedure, etc.\n\n 11. Initially, W.A.No.1042/2021 has been filed before this\n\nCourt on 27.07.2021, which came for admission before this Court\n\non 12.08.2021. The appellant in W.A.No.1042/2021 is the\n\nAdministrator of the Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee\n\nand his case is that he has not filed the appeal against any of the\n\ndecisions of the Guruvayur Devaswom Managing Committee but\n\nthat his predecessor, as the Administrator, had filed an affidavit or\n\nundertaking before the Apex Court in an SLP (filed against the\n\njudgment of the Division Bench of this Court in W.A.No.481/2016\n\nand connected cases), that all appointments to the various posts in\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..12..\n\nthe Guruvayur Devaswom Board other than the hereditary posts,\n\netc., will be made only in accordance with the procedure envisaged\n\nin the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015, in view of\n\nSection 9(1)\n of the said Act and that the resolution of the Managing\n\nCommittee of the Guruvayur Devaswom Board at Ext.P13 may go\n\nagainst the said undertaking and that the appellant, as the\n\nAdministrator, may have to face contempt proceedings for\n\nviolation of the abovesaid undertaking, etc. Further, on merits, it\n\nhas been contended by the appellant that it has been held by the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court in the judgment rendered on\n\n31.08.2017 in W.A. No.481/2016 (\nK. Ajitha & Others v. Guruvayur\n\nDevaswom Managing Committee & Others\n), more particularly in\n\npara No.60 thereof, that in view of the non-obstante clause\n\ncontained in Sec.9(1)(i) of the Kerala Devaswom Board\n\nRecruitment Act, 2015, irrespective of the provisions in the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act\n or the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nEmployees Service Regulations, after commencement of the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015, recruitment to various\n\nDevaswoms in Kerala can be effected only through the machinery\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..13..\n\nunder the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Act, 2015. Hence, it has\n\nbeen contended by the appellant that, even promotions to various\n\nposts in the Guruvayur Devaswom Board can, henceforth, be made\n\nonly in accordance with the provisions contained in the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015, and the Rules framed\n\nthereunder and the provisions contained in the said 2015 Act will\n\noverride the provisions contained in the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nBoard Act and the Regulations framed thereunder, to that extent.\n\nWhereas, the contention of the contesting respondents 1 to 3\n\ntherein/writ petitioners was to the effect that the said provisions,\n\ncontained in the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, would\n\nbe applicable only for preparation of select list for various\n\nappointments, which can only be in the case of direct recruitment\n\nand not on the basis of promotions or by-transfer appointments,\n\netc. for in-service employees, etc.\n\n 12. This Court, then passed an interim order on 12.08.2021\n\nin W.A. No.1042/2021, to the limited extent of staying the\n\noperation and enforcement of the judgment dated 30.07.2021,\n\nrendered by the learned Single Judge, in CoC No.1081/2021\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..14..\n\n(arising out of the instant W.P.(C)), for the time being and no\n\ndirection has been issued by this Court in these appeals, staying\n\nthe operation of the judgment in the W.P.(C). Thereafter, W.A.\n\nNo.1042/2021 has been listed along with W.A. No.1241/2021, filed\n\nat the instance of the Devaswom Recruitment Board.\n\n 13. These appeals have been heard on various occasions\n\nand certain subsequent developments have also happened, more\n\nparticularly, in relation to the issuance of Anx.R1(a) G.O.(Rt)\n\nNo.3244/2021/RD dated 26.09.2021, issued by the respondent\n\nState Government in the Revenue (Devaswom) Department,\n\nwhereby, Ext.P13 decision of the respondent Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee has been canceled and consequentially\n\nAnx.R1(b) proceedings dated 29.09.2021 has also been issued by\n\nthe Administrator, etc. Those aspects of the matters will be dealt\n\nwith in the subsequent portions of this judgment.\n\n 14. The main issue to be resolved in these appeals is as to\n\nwhether all appointments to the various posts, other than the\n\nhereditary posts, etc., be it by the method of direct recruitment,\n\npromotion or by-transfer, etc., can be effectuated only in\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..15..\n\naccordance with the provisions contained in the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015 and the Rules framed thereunder or\n\nwhether the said function of the Devaswom Recruitment Board is\n\nconfined only to direct recruitment, etc. It may be pertinent to\n\nmake a brief reference to the relevant provisions contained in the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n, the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nEmployees Regulations, 1983, framed under the above Act, the\n\nrelevant provisions of the Kerala Public Service Commission\n\n(Additional Functions as Respects the Administrative Services\n\nunder Devaswom Boards) Act, 2008, as well as the relevant\n\nprovisions contained in the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board\n\nAct, 2015 and the Rules framed thereunder. It will also be\n\npertinent to refer to the legal position settled by the Apex Court in\n\nthe leading case laws relating to the distinction between selection\n\nposts and non-selection posts in promotions and by-transfer\n\nappointment especially about the criteria of merit and ability/merit\n\ncum suitability, to be resorted to while making promotion and by-\n\ntransfer appointments to selection posts.\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..16..\n\n 15. Relevant provisions of the \nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act\n\nand the Regulations framed thereunder:\n\n \nSec.19\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978, deals with\n\nappointments of officers and employees. \nSec.19(1)\n stipulates that\n\nappointments of all officers and other employees of the Devaswom\n\nshall be made by the committee. \nSec.2(c)\n thereof defines\n\n'committee' to mean 'Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing\n\nCommittee, constituted under \nSec.3\n. \nSec.19(3)\n further stipulates\n\nthat selection of officers and other employees of the Devaswom\n\nmay be made by sub-committees constituted by the Committee\n\nfrom among its members. The proviso thereto may not be very\n\nrelevant for our purpose. \nSec.19(4)\n further mandates that subject\n\nto the provisions of Sub-Secs (1), (2) & (3) thereof, the procedure\n\nfor selection and appointment of officers and other employees of\n\nthe Devaswom shall be such as may be determined by the\n\nCommittee by regulations made in this behalf. \nSec.39\n thereof deals\n\nwith framing of regulations. \nSec.39(1)\n stipulates that the\n\nCommittee may, subject to the approval of the Government, make\n\nregulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the said Act and\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..17..\n\nthe rules made thereunder, to provide for the manner in which\n\nduties imposed on it under the said Act and its functions\n\nthereunder shall be discharged. \nSec.39(2)\n would further stipulate\n\nthat in particular, and without prejudice to the generality of the\n\nforegoing power, such regulations may provide for- (a) the\n\nconditions of service of the Administrator and the other officers\n\nand employees of the Devaswom, etc.\n\n 16. Ext.P1 is a copy of the Guruvayur Devaswom\n\nEmployees Regulations, 1983, framed under \nSec.39\n of the abovesaid\n\nAct. \nRegulation 4\n thereof deals with appointing authority and it is\n\nmandated therein that the appointing authority, for all the posts in\n\nthe Guruvayur Devaswom Service, shall be the Managing\n\nCommittee. \nRegulation 5\n deals with the method of appointments,\n\nwhich conceive of direct recruitment, which shall be made after\n\ndue publication of notices inviting applications and eligible\n\npersons shall be called for the written test or interview or both and\n\nselection has to be made on the basis of merit. \nRegulation 5(b)\n\nstipulates that, in the case of appointments by promotions or direct\n\nrecruitment, direct recruitment shall be resorted to only if suitable\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..18..\n\nqualified candidates for promotion are not available. \nRegulation\n\n5(c)\n stipulate that the Managing Committee shall decide the\n\nmethod of appointment in the case of temporary post, as and when\n\nrequired. Proviso to \nRegulation 5\n is very important and the same\n\nreads as follows:-\n\n \"Provided that the post of Executive Engineer, Assistant Executive\n Engineer, Assistant Engineer, Deputy Administrator and Manager\n shall be treated as selection categories. Appointment to the selection\n category shall be made by the Managing Committee from among\n members eligible for appointment to such category on the basis of merit\n and ability. Seniority be considered only where merit and ability are\n approximately equal.\"\n\n 17. The table given under \nRegulation 5\n deals with the\n\nvarious posts and the method of appointment. Category No.3\n\nthereof is the post of Manager and it is stipulated therein that the\n\nmethod of appointment, by promotion to the post of Manager,\n\nshall be promotion from the feeder category of Assistant Manager.\n\nFurther, in the subsequent table, dealing with qualifications, the\n\nqualifications for category No.3, post of manager, are also\n\nstipulated therein. \nRegulation 16\n reads as follows:-\n\n \"16. Promotion:-\n\n (a) Probationers working in any post shall be eligible for promotion to\n a higher post as per provisions applicable to employees of State\n Government.\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..19..\n\n (b) All promotions or appointment by transfer shall, subject to the\n provisions of these regulation, be made by the Administrator after\n obtaining approval of the managing Committee in accordance with\n seniority subject to the persons being considered suitable for the\n post.\"\n\n 18. Clause (b) of \nRegulation 16\n, envisages that all\n\npromotions or appointments by transfer shall, subject to the\n\nprovisions of the above regulations, be made by the Administrator,\n\nafter obtaining approval of the Managing Committee, in\n\naccordance with seniority, subject to the persons being considered\n\nsuitable for the post. So, \nRegulation 16(b)\n, by itself, would give an\n\nimpression as if all promotions or all appointments by transfer will\n\nbe on the basis of seniority cum suitability. However, the proviso\n\nto regulation 5 speaks about selection categories of posts.\n\n 19. A cumulative and combined reading of regulation 16(b),\n\nread with the proviso to regulation 5, makes it clear that the posts\n\nof Executive Engineer, Assistant Executive Engineer, Assistant\n\nEngineer, Deputy Administrator and Manager shall be treated as\n\nselection categories of posts and for effecting such promotions to\n\nselection categories, as above, the appointment shall be made by\n\nthe Managing Committee, from among its members eligible for\n\nappointment to such category, on the basis of merit and suitability\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..20..\n\nand seniority being considered only where merit and ability are\n\napproximately equal. So, the cumulative impact of these\n\nprovisions is that, promotions and by-transfer appointments to all\n\nposts, other than selection categories, would be on the basis of\n\nseniority, subject to suitability. But promotions to the selection\n\ncategories of the 4 posts above, shall be only on the basis of merit\n\nand ability and seniority can be considered only when merit and\n\nability are approximately equal.\n\n 20. The provisions contained in the Kerala Public\n\nService Commission (Additional Functions as Respects the\n\nAdministrative Services under the Devaswom Boards) Act, 2008\n\n(State Act 19 of 2008), enables the PSC to exercise certain\n\nadditional functions, as respects the administrative services under\n\ncertain Devaswom Boards. \nSec. 2(a)\n thereof defines \"Devaswom\n\nBoard\" to mean the Travancore Devaswom Board and the Cochin\n\nDevaswom Board.\n\n 21. So, it can be seen that the said State Act 19 of 2008 was\n\nnot, in any manner, made in relation to the appointments in the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Board. More particularly, \nSec.3(1)\n &\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..21..\n\nSec.3(2)\n would make it clear that the duty of the Public Service\n\nCommission is to prepare select list of candidates for appointment\n\nby direct recruitment of all officers and employees in the\n\nAdministrative services of the two Devaswom Boards mentioned\n\ntherein. This is clear from a simple reading of \nSec.3(i)\n as well as\n\nSec.3(2)(a)\n & \nSec.3(2)(b)\n. So, it can be seen that, the main function\n\nentrusted to the Public Service Commission was only in relation to\n\nmaking appointments, by the method of direct recruitment, to the\n\nposts of all officers and employees in the administrative services of\n\nthe two Devaswom boards mentioned therein. The Kerala Public\n\nService Commission (Additional Functions as Respects the\n\nAdministrative Services under the Devaswom Boards) Rules, 2009,\n\nwere also then framed under the said Act. Later, the Travancore\n\nCochin Hindu Religious Institutions (Amendment Act) 2014 (State\n\nAct 1 of 2014) was framed. \nSec. 16\n thereof deals with repeal of the\n\nabovesaid State Act 19 of 2008 and it is stipulated therein that the\n\nKerala Public Service Commission (Additional Functions as\n\nrespects the Administrative Services under Devaswom Boards) Act,\n\n2008 (State Act 19 of 2008) stands thereby repealed, etc. Later, it\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..22..\n\nappears that the State legislature has repealed the abovesaid Act 19\n\nof 2008, entrusting the functions of selections in direct\n\nrecruitment to the said two Devaswom Boards.\n\n 22. We have referred to the provisions contained in the\n\nabovesaid Kerala Public Service Commission (Additional Functions\n\nas respects the Administrative Services under Devaswom Boards)\n\nAct, 2008, only to highlight the aspect that, the main function\n\nentrusted with the KPSC, as per the said Act, was only in relation\n\nto making selection by the method of appointment of direct\n\nrecruitment to the various posts of officers and employees under\n\nthe Devaswoms mentioned therein. In other words, the\n\nentrustment of the functions to the PSC, as per the said Act, was\n\nnot in relation to the method of appointment, other than direct\n\nrecruitment. That is to say, the abovesaid State Act 19 of 2008,\n\ndoes not, in any manner, deal with other methods of appointment\n\nlike promotion, by-transfer, etc.\n\n 23. The relevant provisions of the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015 and the Rules framed thereunder:-\n\n The Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..23..\n\n(State Act 16 of 2015) has been deemed to have come into force\n\non 1st March, 2014. The preamble to the said Act makes it clear\n\nthat the said enactment has been made to \"provide for\n\nconstitution of an autonomous Devaswom Recruitment Board\n\nfor preparing select list of candidates for the appointments\n\nin various posts other than hereditary posts and the posts in\n\nthe aided educational institutions in Devaswom Boards of the\n\nState of Kerala and for matters Connected therewith or\n\nincidental thereto (emphasis supplied)\". \nSection 2(b)\n defines\n\nDevaswom Board to mean the Travancore Devaswom Board or\n\nthe Cochin Devaswom or the Malabar Devaswom Board or\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee or\n\nKoodalmanikyam Devaswom Managing Committee. \nSection 2(a)\n\ndefines \"Board\" to mean \"the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard constituted under \nSection 3\n of the said Act.\" \nSection 2(g)\n\ndefines \"prescribed\" to mean 'prescribed by the Rules or\n\nRegulations made under that Act.\"\n\n 24. The constitution of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard is dealt with in \nSection 3\n thereof. The functions and powers\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..24..\n\nof the Recruitment Board are dealt with in Chapter III of the said\n\nAct. \nSec.9\n, appended under Chapter III, deals with functions of the\n\nRecruitment Board and the same provides as follows:-\n\n \"9. Functions of the Board.- (1) The Board shall have the\n following functions, namely:-\n\n (i) notwithstanding anything contained in any other existing Act or\n Rules or Regulations or orders or judgment or decree in respect of\n the appointment of candidates to the posts in the Devaswom Board,\n the Board shall prepare select list for the appointment of\n candidates to various posts other than the herideary posts and\n posts in the aided educational institutions in the Devaswom Boards as\n per the provisions of this Act, Rule and Regulations ;\n\n (ii) to invite applications, to conduct written examination or\n interview or written examination and interview to prepare select\n list for selection to the various posts other than the heciditary posts\n under the Devaswom Board, as may be prescribed, as and when the\n requisition for such examination is received from the concerned\n Devaswom Board;\n\n (iii) to make all required arrangements in connection with the\n examination including the preparation of question papers,\n supervision of examinations and valuation, conduct of interview and\n preparation of the select list;\n\n (iv) to conduct any other examination relating to Devaswom\n Board as entrusted by the Government;\n\n (v) to call for and obtain details regarding the examination from the\n concerned Devaswom Board;\n\n (2) The Board shall be responsible for the proper conduct of the\n examination, to maintain the secrecy in the preparation of question\n paper, valuation, preparation of the list of candidates to be interviewed\n and preparation of the final select list to be furnished to the Devaswom\n Board and other connected matters and for the safe custody of the\n records pertaining to the examinations.\n\n (3) (i) The Board shall conduct written examination to the candidates who\n had submitted applications and prepare list, after conducting\n interview or written examination and interview;\n\n (ii) Examination may be conducted for any Devaswom Board or for all\n the Devaswom Boards in suitable manner for the said purpose;\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..25..\n\n (iii) An applicant, who applies for more than one post or to more than\n one Devaswom Boards, shall not be denied the right to appear in\n more than one examination.\n\n Provided that if the candidate applies for examinations to various posts\n being conducted by the Board and in the circumstances of conducting\n exarminations to more than one post by the Board on the same day the\n right referred in 3(iii) shall not be available to such candidate.\n\n (4) The procedure to be followed by the Board, in respect of the invitation\n of applications, conduct of written examination, preparation of list of\n candidates to be interviewed, conduct of interview and preparation of\n the select list to various posts in the Devaswom Board, shall be such\n may be prescribed.\n\n (5) The Board may issue general direction to the Devaswom Boards\n incidental to the functions of the Board and as are necessary for the\n conduct the examinations.\n\n (6) It shall be the duty of the Board to furnish the select list to the\n Devaswom Board and advise to the candidate prepared in the manner\n as may be prescribed.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 25. \nSection 18\n of the Act deals with the power to frame Rules.\n\nSection 18(1)\n stipulates that the Government may, by way of\n\nnotification in the Gazette, make Rules, either prospectively or\n\nretrospectively, for carrying out the purpose of the Act. \nSection 18(2)\n\nfurther provides that, in particular and without prejudice to the\n\ngenerality of the aforementioned powers, such Rules may provide for\n\nall or any of the matters mentioned thereunder and Clause (a) and\n\nClause (c) of \nSection 18(2)\n deals with the procedure for the proper\n\nconduct of examination under \nSection 9(4)\n, etc. Clause (f) of\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..26..\n\nSection 18(2)\n empowers framing of Rules, regarding reservation to\n\nbe followed at the time of preparation of select list to various posts\n\nin the Devaswom Board.\n\n 26. The Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Rules, 2015\n\nhas been framed by the State Government under Section 18 of the\n\nKerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and the said Rules\n\n2015 has been notified, as per SRO No.352/2015, in Kerala Gazette\n\nExtraordinary No.1303 dated 30.05.2015. Rule 2(a) thereof defines\n\n\"advice list\" to mean candidates drawn from the select list and\n\narranged on the basis of the rules of recruitment, relating to the\n\npost in respect of the vacancies reported from time to time. Rule\n\n2(b) defines 'examinations' to mean written examination, practical\n\nexamination, physical efficiency test, oral test (interview) and any\n\nother test or examination, which the Board may deem fit to hold.\n\nRule 2(e) defines 'hereditary post' and reference thereto may not\n\nbe necessary as we are not concerned with that aspect. Rule 2(h)\n\ndefines \"select list\" to mean list of candidates arranged in the order\n\nof merit, either on the basis of examiniation, or interview or by\n\nboth. Rule 3 deals with the appointment to various posts, except\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..27..\n\nhereditary posts under various Devaswoms. Rule 3(2) deals with\n\nreservation and rotation for direct recruitments. The Rules have\n\nbeen amended subsequently as per SRO No.905/2019, published\n\nin Kerala Gazette dated 18.11.2019 for introducing provisions for\n\ncommunity reservation under Rule 2. We are not concerned with\n\nthose aspects and hence there is no necessity for us to extract Rule\n\n3(2) and its proviso. The important provisions of Rule 3 which are\n\nrelevant for the present circumstances are those contained in Sub-\n\nrules (1) & (3) thereof, which reads as follows:-\n\n \"3. Appointments to various posts except\n hereditary posts under various Devaswoms:-(1) The Board\n shall have the power to prepare select list for the appointment\n of candidates in various posts except hereditary posts coming under\n the various Devaswom Boards and managing Committees.\n\n (2) xxx xxx xxx xxx\n\n (3) The candidates for appointment to the selection categories and\n grades of the service shall be chosen by the [departmental\n promotion committee] constituted by the Board. The\n Departmental Promotion Committee shall consist of one member from\n the Board as Chairman, member of the Devaswom Board as member\n and Convener and a member nominated by the Government]\n (emphasis\n supplied)\"\n\n 27. Chapter II of the Rules deals with conduct of\n\nexamination. Rule 7 under Chapter II gives the various provisions\n\ncontained for regulating procedure for conducting examination.\n\nRule 7 reads as follows:-\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..28..\n\n \"7. Procedure for conduct of examination.- (1)\n The Board may conduct all the following examinations to assess\n the merits of candidates considered for recruitment to a service\n or post:\n\n (i) Written Examination (except for the posts of Driver and\n Part time Sweeper);\n\n (ii) Practical Test;\n\n (iii) Physical Efficiency Test;\n\n (iv) Oral Test (interview) (marks shall be as fixed by the Board\n but shall not exceed 10 percentage of the total marks)\n\n (v) Any other test or examination which the Board may deem\n fit to hold.\"\n\n 28. The legal position settled by leading case laws rendered\n\nby the Apex Court on selection posts, in promotion on the basis of\n\nmerit and ability/merit cum suitability criteria:-\n\n Now it may be pertinent to refer to some of the leading case\n\nlaws rendered by the Apex Court, on the concept of selection\n\nprocess in promotion based on the criteria of merit and\n\nability/merit cum suitability. It is also pertinent to refer to the\n\nconcept of selection posts and non-selection posts in promotion of\n\nin-service candidate. In Sant Ram Sharma v. State of\n\nRajastan & Ors. [AIR 1967 SC 1910], the Apex Court has pointed\n\nout that the principle of seniority ensures absolute objectivity by\n\nrequiring all promotions to be made entirely on the ground of\n\nseniority and that if a post falls vacant, it is filled by the person who\n\nhas served longest in the post immediately below. But that the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..29..\n\nseniority is so objective that it fails to take any account of personal\n\nmerit and it is fair to every official, except the best ones; an official\n\nhas nothing to win or lose, provided he does not actually become so\n\ninefficient that disciplinary action has to be taken against him. It\n\nwas also held therein that, the criteria of merit, on the other hand,\n\nlays stress on meritorious performance, irrespective of seniority,\n\nand even a person, though junior, but much far meritorious than\n\nhis seniors, is selected for promotion. The Court has expressed the\n\nview that, there should be a correct balance between seniority and\n\nmerit in a proper promotion policy and that the criteria of\n\nseniority-cum-merit and merit-cum-seniority, which takes into\n\naccount the seniority as well as merit, seeks to achieve such a\n\nbalance, etc.\n\n \n29. The Apex Court in the celebrated decision in \nUnion of\n\nIndia v. Mohan Lal Capoor & Ors.\n [AIR 1974 SC 87 = (1973) 2\n\nSCC 836], has observed in para No.17 thereof that, merit is\n\ncertainly an elusive factor, capable of being judged very differently\n\nfrom different angles, or, by applications of varying tests of it by\n\ndifferent persons, or, by the same persons, at different times. The\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..30..\n\nApex Court noted the contention that to make supposed merit the\n\nsole criteria for selection would be to leave the door wide open for\n\nnepotism to creep into selections for higher rungs of public service\n\nby promotion and that this would undermine the morale of\n\nmembers of the State services and weaken incentives for honest\n\nwork and achievement of better standards of proficiency by them.\n\nHowever, in para.18 of \nthe said decision\n, the Apex Court has relied\n\non the observations from Leonard D.White's \"Introduction to\n\nPublic Administration\" (4th edn.\n Pages 380, 383), cited with\n\napproval by the Apex Court in the earlier decision in Sant Ram\n\nSharma's case supra [AIR 1967 SC 1910], wherein it was held as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"The principal object of a promotion system is to secure\n the best possible incumbents for the higher positions, while\n maintaining the morale of the whole organisation. The main\n interest to be served is the public interest, not the personal\n interest of members of the official group concerned. The public\n interest is best secured when reasonable opportunities for\n promotion exist for all qualified employees, when really\n superior civil servants are enabled to move as rapidly up the\n promotion ladder as their merits deserve and as vacancies\n occur, and when selection for promotion is made on the sole\n basis of merit. For the merit system ought to apply as\n specifically in making promotions as in original recruitment.\n\n * * * * *\n\n Employees often prefer the rule of seniority, by which the\n eligible longest in service is automatically awarded the\n promotion. Within limits, seniority is entitled to consideration\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..31..\n\n as one criterion of selection. It tends to eliminate favouritism\n or the suspicion thereof; and experience is certainly a factor in\n the making of a successful employee. Seniority is given most\n weight in promotions from the lowest to other subordinate\n positions. As employees move up the ladder of responsibility,\n it is entitled to less and less weight. When seniority is made\n the sole determining factor, at any level, it is a dangerous\n guide. It does not follow that the employee longest in service\n in a particular grade is best suited for promotion to a higher\n grade; the very opposite may be true.\"\n\n 30. Some of the leading case laws on the abovesaid issues\n\nwould now be examined :-\n\n(\ni) Union of India v. Mohan Lal Capoor & Ors\n.\n\n \n[(1973) 2 SCC 836 = AIR 1974 SC 87]\n\n The scope and ambit of the provision contained in \nRegulation\n\n5(2)\n of the Indian Police Service (Appointment by Promotion)\n\nRegulations, 1955 regarding the criteria of promotion on the basis\n\nof merit-cum-suitability has been considered in \nthe said decision\n.\n\nRegulation 5(2)\n of the IPS (Appointment by Promotion)\n\nRegulations, 1955 mandates that the selection for inclusion in the\n\nselect list shall be based on merit and suitability in all respects with\n\ndue regard to seniority, etc. In para.37 of Mohan Lal Capoor's\n\ncase supra [(1973) 2 SCC 836], it was further held that \nRegulation\n\n5(2)\n says that the selection for inclusion in the list shall be based\n\non merit and suitability in all respects with due regard to seniority\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..32..\n\nand what it means is that, for inclusion in the select list, merit and\n\nsuitability in all respects should be the governing consideration\n\nand that seniority should play only a secondary role and that it is\n\nonly when merit and suitability are roughly equal that seniority will\n\nbe a determining factor, or, if it is not fairly possible to make an\n\nassessment inter se of the merit and suitability of two eligible\n\ncandidates and come to a firm conclusion, seniority would tilt the\n\nscale. The Apex Court held in para.22 thereof that the correct view,\n\nin conformity with the plain meanings of words used in the above\n\nRules is that, the 'entrance' or 'inclusion' test, for a place on the\n\nselect list, is competitive and comparative and applied to all eligible\n\ncandidates and not minimal, like pass marks at an examination.\n\nThat the Selection Committee has an unrestricted choice of the best\n\navailable talent, from amongst eligible candidates, determined by\n\nreference to reasonable criteria applied in assessing the facts\n\nrevealed by service records of all eligible officers so that merit and\n\nnot merely seniority is the governing factor. That a simple reading\n\nof \nRegulation 5(2)\n clearly indicates this to be the correct view and\n\nthat the required number has thus to be selected by a comparison\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..33..\n\nof merits of all the eligible candidates of each year and in making\n\nthis selection, seniority must play its due role. Seniority would,\n\nhowever, only be one of the several factors affecting assessment of\n\nmerit as comparative experience in service should be. It may be\n\npertinent to refer to the contents of paras 37 & 22 of the decision of\n\nthe Apex Court in \nMohan Lal Capoor\n's case supra [(1973) 2\n\nSCC 836], which read as follows: -\n\n \" 37. And, when \nRegulation 5(2)\n says that the\n selection for inclusion in the list shall be based on merit and\n suitability in all respects with due regard to seniority, what\n it means is that for inclusion in the list, merit and suitability\n in all respects should be the governing consideration and\n that seniority should play only a secondary role. It is only\n when merit and suitability are roughly equal that seniority\n will be a determining factor, or, if it is not fairly possible to\n make an assessment inter se of the merit and suitability of\n two eligible candidates and come to a firm conclusion,\n seniority would tilt the scale. But, to say, as the High Court\n has done, that seniority is the determining factor and that it\n is only if the senior is found unfit that the junior can be,\n thought of for inclusion in the list is, with respect, not a\n correct reading of \nRegulation 5(2)\n. I do not know what the\n High Court would have said had \nRegulation 5(2)\n said:\n\n \"Selection for inclusion in the select list shall be based on seniority\n with due regard to merit and suitability\". Would it have said that\n the interpretation to be put upon the hypothetical sub-\n regulation (2) is the same as it put upon the actual sub-\n regulation?\"\n\n \" 22. Thus, we think that the correct view, in\n conformity with the plain meanings of words used in the\n relevant Rules, is that the \"entrance\" or \"inclusion\" test for a\n place on the select list, is competitive and comparative\n applied to all eligible candidates and not minimal like pass\n marks at an examination. The Selection Committee has an\n unrestricted choice of the best available talent, from\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..34..\n\n amongst eligible candidates, determined by reference to\n reasonable criteria applied in assessing the facts revealed\n by service records of all eligible candidates so that merit\n and not mere seniority is the governing factor. A simple\n reading of the \nRegulation 5(2)\n clearly indicates this to be\n the correct view. The required number has thus to be\n selected by a comparison of merits, of all the eligible\n candidates of each year. But, in making this selection,\n seniority must play its due role. Seniority would, however,\n only be one of the several factors affecting assessment of\n merit as comparative experience in service should be. There\n could be a certain number of marks allotted, for purposes of\n facilitating evaluation, to each year of experience gained in\n the service. When the required number for the list is thus\n chosen, the respective roles of seniority and exceptional\n merit would be governed by \nRegulation 5(3)\n. This seems to\n be the correct interpretation of rules as they stand.\"\n\n(\nii) Union of India & Ors. v. Lt.Gen.Rajendra Singh Kadyan\n& anr\n.\n\n \n[(2000) 6 SCC 698]\n\n In \nthe above decision\n, the Apex Court has dealt with various\n\naspects relating to the different criteria for promotion depending\n\nupon the nature of the post and requirements of the service and\n\nthat such criteria would broadly fall into three categories, namely,\n\n 1. seniority-cum-fitness,\n\n 2. seniority-cum-merit,\n\n 3. merit-cum-suitability with due regard to seniority.\n\n It has also been held therein that in deciding whether a post\n\nis a selection post or not, one of the criteria to be considered is that\n\nif it involves a comparative assessment of officers, then necessarily\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..35..\n\nthe element of selection is involved. It was held therein that there\n\nis no requirement of assessment of comparative merit, both in the\n\ncase of seniority-cum-fitness and seniority-cum-merit. Whereas,\n\nthe criteria based on merit-cum-suitability, with due regard to\n\nseniority, as prescribed in the case of promotion to higher posts,\n\netc., necessarily involves assessment of comparative merit of all\n\neligible candidates and selecting the best out of them. In para.11 of\n\nthe said decision\n, the Apex Court has held that broadly, the criteria\n\nfor promotion may fall into three categories, namely,\n\n 1. seniority-cum-fitness,\n\n 2. seniority-cum-merit,\n\n 3. merit-cum-suitability with due regard to seniority.\n\nIn para.12 thereof, it has been held by the Apex Court that,\n\nwherever fitness is stipulated as the basis of selection, it is\n\nregarded as a non-selection post, to be filled on the basis of\n\nseniority, subject to rejection of the unfit and that fitness means\n\nfitness in all respects. Further that, seniority-cum-merit\n\npostulates the requirement of certain minimum merit or satisfying\n\na benchmark previously fixed and subject to fulfilling this\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..36..\n\nrequirement of minimum merit, the promotion is based on\n\nseniority. That there is no requirement of assessment of\n\ncomparative merit both in the case of seniority-cum-fitness and\n\nseniority-cum-merit, as even for the latter, what is involved is only\n\nassessment of minimum merit and promotion based on seniority\n\nfrom amongst those incumbents, who have the minimum merit. It\n\nwill be pertinent to refer to para.12 of \nLt.Gen.Rajendra Singh\n\nKadyan\n's case supra [(2000) 6 SCC 698], which reads as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"12. Wherever fitness is stipulated as the basis of selection, it\n is regarded as a non-selection post to be filled on the basis of\n seniority subject to rejection of the unfit. Fitness means fitness\n in all respects. \"Seniority-cum-merit\" postulates the\n requirement of certain minimum merit or satisfying a\n benchmark previously fixed. Subject to fulfilling this\n requirement the promotion is based on seniority. There is no\n requirement of assessment of comparative merit both in the\n case of seniority-cum-fitness and seniority-cum-merit. Merit-\n cum-suitability with due regard to seniority as prescribed in\n the case of promotion to All-India Services necessarily involves\n assessment of comparative merit of all eligible candidates, and\n selecting the best out of them.\"\n\n \nThe Apex Court in para.20 of \nthe said decision\n considered\n\nthe said argument that the appointment to the post of Army\n\nCommander is of selection and not a mere promotion on the basis\n\nof seniority. Whereas, the Union of India argued that appointment\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..37..\n\nto the post of Army Commander is a selection post and not a post\n\nto be filled up by promotion merely on the basis of seniority. The\n\nApex Court, after consideration of the norms, held that the clear\n\nindication is that it is a selection post and not a mere promotion\n\non the basis of seniority, etc. Further, it has been specifically held\n\nby the Apex Court, in para.26 of \nthe above decision\n, that in\n\ndeciding whether a post is a selection post or not, one of the\n\ncriteria to be considered is if it involves a comparative assessment\n\nof officers, then necessarily an element of selection is involved and,\n\ntherefore, the post is a selection post, etc. In the said case, the\n\ncontention was raised before the Apex Court that the hierarchy in\n\nthe Army and the method of selection and promotion to various\n\nposts, starting from the post of Lieutenant and going up to the post\n\nof the Chief of the Army Staff, will clearly indicate that the posts of\n\nLieutenant, Captain and Major are automatic promotion posts, on\n\npassing the promotion examination, irrespective of inter se merit,\n\nwhereas the posts from Major to Lt.Colonel to Colonel, Colonel to\n\nBrigadier, Brigadier to Major General and Major General to\n\nLt.General are all selection posts filled up by promotion on the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..38..\n\nbasis of relative merit assessed by the designated Selection Boards.\n\nBut it was contended that the post of Lt. General (Corps\n\nCommander) to Army Commander, is a non-selection post to\n\nwhich promotion is made, subject to fitness and that it is only a\n\npromotion, subject to fitness in all respects, although the rank\n\nremains the same, etc.\n\n(\niii) B.V.Sivaiah & Ors. v. K.Addanki Babu & Ors\n.\n\n [(1998) 6 SCC 720]\n\n In the abovesaid decision, the Apex Court has considered the\n\ncase of promotions, where the criteria is based on seniority-cum-\n\nmerit and merit-cum-seniority. It has been held in paras.9 & 10\n\nthereof, that the principle of \"merit-cum-seniority\" lays greater\n\nemphasis on merit and ability and seniority plays a less significant\n\nrole and seniority is to be given weight only when merit and ability\n\nare approximately equal. On the other hand, as between the two\n\nprinciples of seniority and merit, the criteria of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit lays greater emphasis on seniority, but an officer cannot\n\nclaim promotion, as a matter of right, by virtue of his seniority\n\nalone and if he is found unfit to discharge the duties of the higher\n\npost, he may be passed over and an officer junior to him may be\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..39..\n\npromoted. It may be pertinent to refer to the contents of paras.9,\n\n10 & 11 of the decision of the Apex Court in \nB.V.Sivaiah\n's case\n\nsupra [(1998) 6 SCC 720], which read as follows:-\n\n \"9. The principle of \"merit-cum-seniority\" lays greater emphasis\n on merit and ability and seniority plays a less significant role.\n Seniority is to be given weight only when merit and ability are\n approximately equal. \nIn the context of Rule 5(2) of the Indian\n Administrative Service/Indian Police Service (Appointment by\n Promotion) Regulations, 1955 which prescribed that \"selection for\n inclusion in such list shall be based on merit and suitability in all\n respects with due regard to seniority\" Mathew, J. in \nUnion of India\n v. Mohan Lal Capoor\n [(1973) 2 SCC 836 : 1974 SCC (L&S) 5] has\n said: (SCC p. 856, para 37)\n\n \"[F]or inclusion in the list, merit and suitability in all\n respects should be the governing consideration and that\n seniority should play only a secondary role. It is only when\n merit and suitability are roughly equal that seniority will be\n a determining factor, or if it is not fairly possible to make an\n assessment inter se of the merit and suitability of two eligible\n candidates and come to a firm conclusion, seniority would\n tilt the scale.\"\n\n Similarly, Beg, J. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) has said:\n\n (SCC p. 851, para 22)\n \"22. Thus, we think that the correct view, in conformity\n with the plain meaning of words used in the relevant Rules, is\n that the 'entrance' or 'inclusion' test for a place on the select\n list, is competitive and comparative applied to all eligible\n candidates and not minimal like pass marks at an\n examination.

On the other hand, as between the two principles of\n seniority and merit, the criterion of \"seniority-cum-merit\" lays\n greater emphasis on seniority. \nIn \nState of Mysore v. Syed\n Mahmood\n [AIR 1968 SC 1113 : (1968) 3 SCR 363 : (1970) 1 LLJ\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..40..\n\n 370] while considering Rule 4(3)(b) of the Mysore State Civil\n Services General Recruitment Rules, 1957 which required\n promotion to be made by selection on the basis of seniority-\n cum-merit, this Court has observed that the Rule required\n promotion to be made by selection on the basis of \"seniority\n subject to the fitness of the candidate to discharge the duties of the\n post from among persons eligible for promotion\". It was pointed\n out that where the promotion is based on seniority-cum-merit,\n the officer cannot claim promotion as a matter of right by\n virtue of his seniority alone and if he is found unfit to\n discharge the duties of the higher post, he may be passed over\n and an officer junior to him may be promoted.\n\n 11. \nIn \nState of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas\n [(1976) 2 SCC 310 :\n\n 1976 SCC (L&S) 227] A.N. Ray, C.J. has thus explained the\n criterion of \"seniority-cum-merit\": (SCC p. 335, para 38)\n \"With regard to promotion the normal principles\n are either merit-cum-seniority or seniority-cum-merit.\n Seniority-cum-merit means that given the minimum\n necessary merit requisite for efficiency of\n administration, the senior though the less meritorious\n shall have priority.\"\n\nThe said decision dealt with the norms for promotion to post\n\ncovered by the Regional Rural Banks (Appointment & Promotions\n\nof Officers and Other Employees) Rules, 1988. Rule 7 thereof dealt\n\nwith promotions to the post of Area Managers and Senior\n\nManagers and it was stipulated therein that the source of\n\nrecruitment would be 100% by promotion from amongst\n\nconfirmed officers working in the bank and promotions will be on\n\nthe basis of 'seniority-cum-merit'. Rule 7(c) dealt with mode of\n\nselection and it has been mentioned therein that the mode will be\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..41..\n\ninterview and assessment of performance reports for the preceding\n\nthree years' period as officer for promotion. The Apex Court has\n\ncategorically held in para.18 of \nthe said decision\n that the criterion\n\nof \"seniority-cum-merit\" in the matter of promotion postulates\n\nthat given the minimum necessary merit requisite for efficiency of\n\nadministration, the senior, even though less meritorious, shall have\n\npriority and a comparative assessment of merit is not required to\n\nbe made. That for assessing the minimum necessary merit, the\n\ncompetent authority can lay down the minimum standard that is\n\nrequired and also prescribe the mode of assessment of merit of the\n\nemployee who is eligible for consideration for promotion and such\n\nassessment can be made by assigning marks on the basis of\n\nappraisal of performance on the basis of service record and\n\ninterview and prescribing the minimum marks which would entitle\n\na person to be promoted on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. It\n\nwas held therein that once the incumbents possess the requisite\n\nminimum merit so assessed, then seniors will have to be promoted\n\nfor promotion, where the criteria is 'seniority-cum-merit'. On\n\nfacts, the Apex Court held in many of the decisions dealt with\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..42..\n\ntherein that the methodology adopted by the promotion authority,\n\nto rate the officers on the basis of their performance in the merit\n\nassessment, would be completely contrary to the principle of\n\n\"seniority-cum-merit\" and it virtually amounts to application of the\n\nprinciple of \"merit-cum-seniority\", etc.\n\n(\niv) Harigovind Yadav v. Rewa Sidhi Gramin Bank &\nOrs\n.\n\n \n[(2006) 6 SCC 145]\n\n This case also dealt with promotion for employees of the\n\n1st respondent-Bank therein, which was governed by the Regional\n\nRural Banks (Appointment & Promotions of Officers and Other\n\nEmployees) Rules, 1988. Para.3 of \nthe said decision\n would indicate\n\nthat promotion quota is 50% and promotion shall be on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit from amongst the eligible and the feeder\n\ncategory and 50% is for direct recruitment, for which the mode of\n\nselection is written test and interview.\n \nIn this case, the Apex Court\n\nhas relied on the earlier decision rendered in \nB.V.Sivaiah\n's case\n\nsupra [(1998) 6 SCC 720].\n \nThe Apex Court in \nHarigovind\n\nYadav\n's case supra noted in para.21 thereof that this Court in the\n\nearlier decision in \nB.V.Sivaiah\n's case supra did not accept the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..43..\n\npromotion policy contained in the impugned circular therein as\n\nbeing in consonance with the principle of merit-cum-seniority\n\nmandated in the Rules. The Apex Court held that the policy which\n\ndid not prescribe a minimum standard for assessing merit and\n\nwhich promoted candidates on the basis of comparative merit, with\n\nreference to total marks obtained by the eligible candidates,\n\nfollowed the merit-cum-seniority principle and not the prescribed\n\nseniority-cum-merit norms. In para.22 of Harigovind Yadav's\n\ncase supra, it was held by the Apex Court that the interviews can\n\nbe held and assessment of performance can be made by the\n\nemployer in connection with promotions. But that can be only to\n\nassess the minimum necessary merit, where the criterion for\n\npromotion is seniority-cum-merit. But where the procedure does\n\nnot provide the minimum standard for promotion, but only the\n\nminimum standard for interview and effects the selection with\n\nreference to comparative marks, it was held to be contrary to the\n\nrule of \"seniority-cum merit\". It was also held therein that the law\n\nlaid down earlier by the Apex Court in \nB.V.Sivaiah\n's case supra\n\n[(1998) 6 SCC 720] has been subsequently followed and reiterated\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..44..\n\nin the case in \nSher Singh v. Surinder Kumar\n [(1998) 9 SCC\n\n652], wherein the Apex Court had occasion to consider a similar\n\nquestion relating to the promotion for the post of Clerk to Field\n\nSupervisor in the case of another Gramin Bank. In Sher Singh's\n\ncase supra, the Apex Court held that the criterion for making\n\npromotion from the post of Clerk to that of Field Supervisor was\n\nseniority-cum-merit, but the Bank had not followed the criterion of\n\nseniority-cum-merit, but made promotions on the basis of merit-\n\ncum-seniority and that the promotion was vitiated and was\n\ntherefore invalid.\n \nThe Apex Court again reiterated in para.23 of\n\nHarigovind Yadav\n's case supra that \nin that case\n where the Rule\n\nmandated promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, the\n\nprocedure followed therein, of making promotion on the basis of\n\ngradation in the marks secured in the interview was held to be\n\ncontrary to the prescribed criteria of seniority-cum-merit, etc.\n\n(\nv) Sarat Kumar Dash & Ors. v. Biswajit Patnaik & Ors\n.\n\n [1995 Supp (1) SCC 434]\n\n In this case, the Apex Court dealt with the criteria of\n\npromotion on the basis of merit-cum-suitability and the role of\n\nseniority was also considered and it was held that where after\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..45..\n\nconsideration and evaluation, merit and suitability were found to\n\nbe superior, then seniority was held to have no role to play in the\n\nselection. \nIn para.8 of \nSarat Kumar Dash\n's case supra, the\n\nApex Court held that, in the case of merit-cum-suitability, seniority\n\nshould have no role to play, when the candidates were found to be\n\nmeritorious and suitable for higher posts and in such a case, even a\n\njuniormost personnel may steal a march over his seniors and jump\n\nthe queue for accelerated promotions. That this principle of\n\nmerit-cum-suitability inculcates dedicated service and accelerates\n\nability and encourages merit to improve excellence. That, seniority\n\nwould have its due place only where merit and ability are\n\napproximately equal or where it is not possible to assess the inter\n\nse merit and suitability of two equally eligible competing\n\ncandidates, who come very close in the order of merit and\n\nsuitability. Under those circumstances, seniority will have its due\n\nrole and it will be called in aid for consideration. But in case where\n\nthe relative merit and suitability or ability have been considered\n\nand evaluated and found to be superior, then seniority has no role.\n\nIn that case, the Apex Court held that there the promotion\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..46..\n\nwas to be made under the principle of merit-cum-suitability with\n\ndue regard to seniority and there are no statutory rules. Then,\n\nawarding of the marks by the PSC on the basis of grading of\n\nconfidential records for a certain number of years, six years \nin that\n\ncase\n, preceding the time of selection, was held to be valid and that\n\nin such grading it was not incumbent on the PSC to state reasons for\n\nthe recommendations it made or on the Government for accepting\n\nthose recommendations.\n \nIn para.7 of \nSarat Kumar Dash\n's case\n\nsupra, the Apex Court has relied on the dictum laid down earlier by\n\nthe Apex Court in the celebrated \nMohan Lal Capoor\n's case supra\n\n[(1973) 2 SCC 836 para.37].\n \nIt will be pertinent to refer to the\n\ncontents of paras.8, 9 & 11 of the decision of the Apex Court in\n\nSarat Kumar Dash\n's case supra, which read as follows:-\n\n \"8. In case of merit-cum-suitability, the seniority should have\n no role to play when the candidates were found to be\n meritorious and suitable for higher posts. Even a juniormost\n man may steal a march over his seniors and jump the queue\n for accelerated promotion. This principle inculcates dedicated\n service, and accelerates ability and encourages merit to\n improve excellence. The seniority would have its due place only\n where the merit and ability are approximately equal or where\n it is not possible to assess inter se merit and the suitability of\n two equally eligible competing candidates who come very close\n in the order of merit and ability. Under those circumstances,\n the seniority will play its due role and calls it in aid for\n consideration. But in case where the relative merit and\n suitability or ability have been considered and evaluated, and\n found to be superior, then the seniority has no role to play. In\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..47..\n\n our view the PSC has evolved correct procedure in grading the\n officers and the marks have been awarded according to the\n grading. It is seen that the four officers have come in the\n grading of 'B'. In consequence, the PSC had adopted the\n seniority of the appellants and Panda in the lower cadre in\n recommending their cases for appointment in the order of\n merit.\n\n \n9. Mr Mehta, the learned counsel for the respondent-\n J.P.Mishra contended that the PSC itself has evolved grading\n of outstanding, very good, good, satisfactory, average etc.\n from C Rs which is not open to the PSC to evolve grading. We\n cannot accept that contention to be correct. Firstly, this\n contention was not raised in the Tribunal and secondly, from\n the file produced before us by the PSC, it is clear that they have\n seen the grading was given by the Government and they\n evolved the criteria of giving marks on the basis of the grading\n given by the Government. With regard to the merit and ability\n this Court has consistently been following the view as extracted\n herein from \nCapoor\n case [(1973) 2 SCC 836 : 1974 SCC (L&S)\n 5 : (1974) 1 SCR 797] in other decisions vide \nR.S. Dass v. Union\n of India\n [1986 Supp SCC 617 : (\n1987) 2 ATC 628], National\n Institute of Mental Health & Neuro Sciences v. Dr K. Kalyana\n Raman\n [1992 Supp (2) SCC 481, para 7 : 1992 SCC (L&S) 959 :\n\n (1992) 21 ATC 680 : AIR 1992 SC 1806] and Syed Khalid Rizvi\n v.

The next question is whether omission to record reasons\n amounts to violation of the principles of natural justice. The\n principle of audi alteram partem is a basic concept of the\n principle of natural justice. The omnipotency inherent in the\n doctrine is that no one should be condemned without being\n heard or given an opportunity to the person affected to present\n his case before taking the decision or action. In the field of\n administrative action, this principle has been applied to ensure\n fair play and justice to the affected person. However, the\n doctrine is not a cure to all the ills in the process. Its\n application depends upon the factual matrix to improve\n administrative efficiency and expediency and to meet out\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..48..\n\n justice. The procedure adopted would be just and fair. The\n reasons are links between maker of the order or the author of\n the decision and the order itself. The record is called to\n consider whether he has given due consideration to the facts\n placed before him before he arrives at the decision. Therefore,\n the reasons in the order or found from the record bridges the\n link between the maker of the order and the order itself or\n decision. Therefore the natural justice is not a rigid nor an\n inflexible rule. It should be applied to a given fact situation,\n depending upon the background of the statutory provisions,\n nature of the right which may be affected and the\n consequences that may entail. It is already seen that the\n Commission evolved the objective criteria in awarding marks\n to the given grading of the candidates and on its basis\n recommended their cases for promotion. \nIn \nR.S. Dass\n case\n [1986 Supp SCC 617 : (1987) 2 ATC 628] this Court held that\n the grading itself is a reason and no separate reasons in that\n behalf in arranging the order of merit need be given. The\n grading is to obviate the need to record reasons. The finding of\n the Tribunal that the selection by PSC without recording\n reasons or need to record separately the reasons for evolving\n the criteria for selection is also clearly illegal.\"\n\n(\nvi) Union of India & Ors. v. Chetan S.Naik\n\n [(1999) 6 SCC 457]\n\n In this case, the Three Judge Bench of the Apex Court\n\nconsidered the issue as to how inference can be made when the\n\nrelevant rule mentions \"promotion\" as the criterion. The\n\nRecruitment Rules \nin that case\n had used three different\n\nexpressions, viz. \"selection\", \"promotion-cum-fitness\"and\n\n\"promotion\". It was held therein that \"promotion\" criterion could\n\nnot be given the same meaning as \"selection\" criterion. That\n\ncomparative assessment of merit, which is applied in the case of\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..49..\n\n\"selection\" criterion was inapplicable in the case of \"promotion\"\n\ncriterion. In \"promotion\" criterion, promotion was to be given on\n\nthe basis of seniority, subject to the candidate's fitness. It will be\n\npertinent to refer to the contents of paras.3 to 5 of \nthe said decision\n\nof the Apex Court in \nChetan S.Naik\n's case supra [(1999) 6 SCC\n\n457], which reads as follows:-\n\n \" 3. On a plain interpretation of the word \"promotion\"\n\n occurring in Rule 7(2) in regard to 50% and the words\n \"promotion\" at Serial Nos. 3, 4 and 5 of Schedule IV and\n Schedule V, it is clear that for the 50% JTS posts at Serial No.\n 5, the appointment is by \"promotion\" while for appointment\n to the post at Serial No. 3, it is by \"selection\" and for\n appointment to posts at Serial No. 4 it is by \"promotion-cum-\n fitness\". Thus for the appointment at these three levels, the\n rule-making authority has used different and distinct words,\n\n -- \"selection\", \"promotion-cum-fitness\" and \"promotion\" and\n that indicates that the word \"promotion\" at Serial No. 5 for\n JTS posts is not to be given the same meaning as \"selection\" at\n Serial No. 3. In other words, for appointment to posts in JTS\n at Serial No. 5, no selection by assessment of comparative\n merit is contemplated either in the rules or in Schedule IV and\n Schedule V.\n\n 4. The Full Bench at Madras and the Jaipur Bench\n have relied upon Note 2 below Schedule IV and Schedule V to\n hold that even for JTS posts at Serial No. 5, appointment is by\n \"selection\". It is no doubt true that Note 2 uses the words\n \"field of selection\" but that, in our opinion, is meant for the\n purpose of considering the \"options\" to be exercised by those\n in the feeder category -- choice is to \"opt\" for being allocated\n to the Management or the Programme wings of JTS posts --\n but the \"selection\" process under Note 2 is limited to\n considering the suitability of those in the feeder category to\n be allocated either to the \"Programme Wing\" or to the\n \"Production Wing\", as the case may be, among the JTS posts.\n The DPC's role is, thus, limited to the selection of the\n promotees for either of these two wings. That note, in our\n view, has no bearing on the meaning of the word \"promotion\"\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..50..\n\n in Rule 7(2) or on the word \"promotion\" at Serial No. 5 in\n Schedules IV and V.\n\n 5. Keeping in view the relevant rules, we, thus, find\n that the view taken by the Ernakulam Bench is the correct\n view in the sense that the method of promotion to JTS posts is\n on the basis of promotion by seniority, subject to finding out\n the fitness of the candidate for the Programme Wing or the\n Production Wing, through the DPC. The Karnataka Bench,\n therefore, rightly followed the Ernakulam Bench decision.\n We, therefore, do not see any reason to interfere in the two\n special leave petitions. As a consequence, the Full Bench view\n of the Madras Tribunal in OA No. 1221 of 1994 cannot be said\n to be laying down the correct law.\"\n\n31. Resolution of the main issues in this case:\n\n As indicated hereinabove, the main issue to be decided in\n\nthis case is as to whether appointments to all posts in the\n\nDevaswom Board (other than the hereditary post and posts in the\n\naided educational institutions in the Devaswom Boards), can be\n\nfilled up only on the basis of the junction and involvement of the\n\nKerala Devaswom Recruitment Board, irrespective as to whether\n\nthe method of appointment is direct recruitment, promotion or by-\n\ntransfer, etc., in view of the non-obstante clause contained in\n\nSec.9(1)(i) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Act, 2015 or\n\nwhether the said role and function of the Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard is confined only to selection for appointment to posts to be\n\nfilled up by the method of appointment through 'direct\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..51..\n\nrecruitment'. We would answer these crucial issues in the light of\n\nthe discussion made hereinabove about the provisions contained\n\nin the \nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n, the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Employees Regulations, 1983, the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015, the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard Rules, 2015 and also with reference to the case laws\n\ndiscussed hereinabove. One of the main contentions raised by the\n\nappellants is that the Division Bench of this Court, as per para.60\n\nof the judgment dated 31.08.2017 in W.A No.481/2016 &\n\nconnected appeals (\nK.Ajitha\n's case supra), has already held that,\n\nin view of the abovesaid non-obstante provision contained in\n\nSec.9(1)(i) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015,\n\nirrespective as to the provisions contained in the \nGuruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Act\n or the Guruvayoor Devaswom Employees\n\nRegulations, after commencement of the Kerala Devaswom Board\n\nAct, 2015, recruitment to various devaswoms in Kerala can be\n\neffected only through the machinery under the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Act, 2015. Hence, it is contended by the appellants\n\nthat all appointments, irrespective as to whether the method of\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..52..\n\nappointment is direct recruitment, promotion or by-transfer,\n\nto various posts in the Devaswoms can be effected only\n\nthrough the involvement and junction of the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board as to the provisions of the\n\nsaid Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and the Rules framed\n\nthereunder, etc.\n\n \n32. At the outset, we note that the main factual issue,\n\nraised in the said cases considered in \nK.Ajitha\n's case supra,\n\nwas regarding temporary appointments made by the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom, instead of the regular method of direct\n\nrecruitment, in lieu of the regular selection by direct\n\nrecruitment and the subsequent claim made by such temporary\n\nemployees for regularization in the service. So, essentially the\n\nmethod of appointment involved in those cases was direct\n\nrecruitment. No dispute whatsoever has been raised in the\n\npresent cases that the method of appointment, to fill up the post is\n\nby methods other than direct recruitment.\n\n \n33. After hearing both sides and after going through\n\nthe said judgment\n of the Division Bench of this Court in\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..53..\n\nK.Ajitha\n's case supra, we are of the view that the\n\nabovesaid aspect regarding selection by direct recruitment\n\nalone has been considered in \nthe said judgment\n and the\n\npresent issue as to whether other methods of appointment\n\nlike promotion, by-transfer, etc., should also involve the\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board, has not been directly raised\n\nand decided in \nK.Ajitha\n's case supra.\n\n 34. A subsequent judgment rendered by a\n\nDivision Bench of this Court on 10.11.2020 in W.P.(C)\n\nNo.16530/2020 & W.P.(C) No.12652/2020 has been produced\n\nas Ext.P-5 in the instant W.P.(C). A reading of para.3 of\n\nExt.P-5 judgment would indicate that the Division Bench\n\nhas observed therein that the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard (3rd respondent therein) was established in the year\n\n2015 and promotion to the posts above Assistant Manager\n\nare presently entrusted with them (i.e. with the said\n\nRecruitment Board). That is only an incidental observation\n\nmade by the Division Bench and the issue as to whether all\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..54..\n\npromotions and by-transfers, including to selection posts and non-\n\nselection posts, can also be effected only through the involvement\n\nof the Devaswom Recruitment Board, has not been directly raised\n\nand decided in Ext.P-5 judgment. The issue that was directly and\n\nsubstantially raised and decided in Ext.P-5 writ proceedings, was\n\nas to the manner and methodology of framing regulations under\n\nSec.39\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978 and as to the scope\n\nand ambit of the process of securing approval of the State\n\nGovernment to the regulations that are to be framed by the\n\nManaging Committee of the Guruvayoor Devaswom under\n\nSec.39\n thereof. However, certainly we have to take note that\n\nthe Division Bench has already observed, in para.3 of Ext.P-5\n\njudgment in W.P(C) Nos.16530/2020 & 12652/2020, that after the\n\nestablishment of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Board, promotions to\n\nthe post of above Assistant Managers, have been presently\n\nentrusted with them, etc. This Court will have to certainly give due\n\nweightage to the said observations made by the Division Bench in\n\npara.3 of Ext.P-5 judgment., even though that by itself may not\n\nconclude the issue inasmuch as the issue involved in this case, as\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..55..\n\nmentioned hereinabove, has not been directly and substantially\n\nraised and decided in Ext.P-5.\n\n 35. After examining the relevant provisions contained in\n\nthe \nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n and the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Employees Regulations, 1983 framed under the said\n\nAct, the following aspects will have to be borne in mind :\n\n 36. \nSec.19(1)\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n\nmandates that the appointment of all officers and other employees\n\nof the Devaswom shall be made by the Committee mentioned\n\ntherein, which is the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing\n\nCommittee, constituted in terms of \nSec.3\n of the said Act. True\n\nthat, sub-\nsection 3\n of \nSec.19\n also stipulates that selection of officers\n\nand other employees of the Devaswom may be made by such\n\nsub-committee constituted by the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee from among its members. The proviso\n\nthereto is not relevant for the present purpose. \nSec.19(4)\n further\n\nmandates that, subject to the provisions contained in sub-sections\n\n(1), (2) & (3) of the said section, the procedure for the selection and\n\nappointment of officers and other employees of the Devaswom\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..56..\n\nshall be such as may be determined by the Managing Committee\n\nby regulations made in that behalf. \nSec.39 (1)\n of the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Act, 1978 specifically mandates that the Managing\n\nCommittee may, subject to the approval of the Government, make\n\nregulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and the\n\nrules made thereunder, to provide for the manner in which the\n\nduties imposed on it, under the said Act and its functions\n\nthereunder, shall be discharged. Clause (a) of sub-section (2) of\n\nSec.39\n further provides that, in particular, and without prejudice\n\nto the generality of the fore-going power, such regulations may\n\nprovide for-\n\n \"(a) the conditions of service of the Administrator and the\n other officers and employees of the Devaswom;\"\n\n 37. In the light of the provisions contained in \nSec.19 (4)\n\n& \nSec.39(2)(a)\n, the Guruvayoor Devaswom Employees\n\nRegulations, 1983 has been framed with the prior approval of the\n\nState Government. The relevant portion of the said service\n\nregulations is provided at Ext.P-1 in the W.P(C). In this case, we\n\nare mainly concerned with promotion to the post of Manager from\n\nthe feeder category of Assistant Manager. We have already\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..57..\n\nmentioned about the details of \nRegulation 5\n & \nRegulation 16\n in the\n\nearlier portions of this judgment. The combined and cumulative\n\neffect of \nRegulation 16\n, read with \nRegulation 5\n, more particularly\n\nthe proviso thereto, is that, generally, all promotions or\n\nappointments by transfer shall, subject to the provisions of the\n\nabove regulations, be made by the Administrator after obtaining\n\nthe approval of the Managing Committee, in accordance with\n\nseniority, subject to the persons being considered suitable for the\n\npost. However, an exception has been carved out by the\n\nengraftment of the proviso to \nRegulation 5\n, which mandates that\n\nthe posts mentioned therein, including the post of Manager, shall\n\nbe treated as selection categories and appointments to the\n\nselection category shall be made by the Managing Committee from\n\namongst members eligible for appointment to such category on the\n\nbasis of merit and ability and seniority being considered only\n\nwhere merit and suitability are approximately equal. So, at the\n\noutset, it has to be held that promotion from the feeder category of\n\nAssistant Manager to the higher category of Manager is the\n\npromotion to a selection post and not to a non-selection post and\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..58..\n\nthe criterion for such promotion shall be merit and ability and\n\nseniority can be considered only where merit and ability are\n\napproximately equal for the incumbents under consideration.\n\n 38. We may also have to refer to some of the provisions\n\ncontained in the The Kerala Public Service Commission\n\n(Additional Functions as Respects the Administrative Services\n\nunder Devaswom Boards) Act, 2008 (State Act 19 of 2008), which\n\nwas later repealed as per Sec.16 of State Act 1 of 2014 made\n\neffective from 03.02.2014. At the outset, it has been mentioned\n\nthat only two Devaswom Boards, Travancore Devaswom Board &\n\nCochin Devaswom Board alone were brought within the selection\n\npurview of the KPSC, as per State Act 19 of 2008. However, a\n\nreference to those provisions would be relevant and germane,\n\ninasmuch as the present Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act,\n\n2015 would bring within its fold not only the abovesaid two\n\nDevaswom Boards, viz., Travancore Devaswom Board and Cochin\n\nDevaswom Board, but certain other Devaswom Boards also,\n\nincluding the Guruvayoor Devaswom Board. As already discussed\n\nhereinabove, the said State Act 19 of 2008, had brought within its\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..59..\n\nselection purview only selection by way of direct recruitment of all\n\nofficers and employees of the administrative services of the said\n\nDevaswom Boards concerned. In other words, only selection by\n\nway of direct recruitment of the officers and employees in the\n\nadministrative services in the Devaswom Boards concerned alone\n\nwere brought in the purview of the said State Act 19 of 2008 and the\n\nother methods of appointments like promotion and by-transfer,\n\nirrespective as to whether it is selection post or non- selection post,\n\nwere not brought within the purview of the PSC as per the said\n\nState Act 19 of 2008. We are referring to the said provisions\n\ncontained in the said State Act 19 of 2008, which was subsequently\n\nrepealed in 2014, only to compare the corresponding provisions\n\nmade in the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015.\n\n 39. The Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Ordinance,\n\n2015 (State Ordinance No.5/2015) earlier promulgated, was later\n\nrepealed and replaced by the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board\n\nAct, 2015 (State Act 16 of 2015). \nSec.1(2)\n of the said Act stipulates\n\nthat the said Act shall be deemed to have come into force on\n\n1.3.2014. It is clearly mentioned in the beginning portion of said\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..60..\n\nAct, that the said Act is to provide for constitution of an\n\nautonomous Devaswom Recruitment Board for preparing select\n\nlist of candidates for appointment in various posts other\n\nthan hereditary posts and posts in aided educational\n\ninstitutions in Devaswom Boards of the State of Kerala\n\nand for matters conducted therewith or incidental\n\nthereto.(Emphasis applied) Further, the Preamble to said Act also\n\ncategorically declares that, it is expedient to provide for the\n\nconstitution of an autonomous Devaswom Recruitment Board for\n\npreparing select list of candidates. The term 'select list'\n\nappearing in the Objective and Preamble of the Act has not been\n\nspecifically defined in the said Act. However, \nSec.9(4)\n of the Act\n\ninter alia provides that matters of preparation of select list(Emphasis\napplied)\n to various posts in the Devaswom Board, shall be such\n\nas may be prescribed.(Emphasis applied) \nSec.2(g)\n of the Act defines the\n\nword 'prescribed' to mean prescribed by rules or regulations made\n\nunder this Act. \nSec.18(2)(c)\n explicitly confers power to the State\n\nGovernment to frame rules regarding the procedure contemplated\n\nunder \nSec.9(4)\n of the Act. Rule 2(h) of the Kerala Devaswom\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..61..\n\nRecruitment Board Rules, 2015, framed by the State Government,\n\nin exercise of the powers under \nSec.18\n of the abovesaid Act, defines\n\n'select list' to mean list of candidates arranged in the order of\n\nmerit, either on the basis of interview or examination or by both.\n\nSo, in the absence of an explicit definition for the term 'select list'\n\nappearing in the Objective and Preamble of the Act as well as in\n\nother provisions as in \nSecs.9(1)(i)\n, \n9(4)\n, etc has to be understood in\n\na more broader sense and perspective than the narrow definition\n\ncontained in Rule 2(h) of the Rules, and we would be giving\n\nreasons hereinafter for arriving at the said conclusion. For the\n\nreasons to be stated by us hereinafter, it appears that the\n\ndefinition of the term 'select list' appearing in Rule 2(h) is within a\n\nvery narrow compass, and therefore it has been contended by the\n\nwrit petitioners that the term 'select list' will have to be understood\n\nonly with reference to the selection process in direct recruitment,\n\nand not in the case of promotions or by-transfer appointments, etc.\n\nSec.9(1)(i)\n provides that the functions conferred on the\n\nRecruitment Board as per the said Act shall be\n\nnotwithstanding anything contained in any other Act/\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..62..\n\nRules/Regulations/Orders/Judgments/Decree, in respect of the\n\nappointment of candidates to the posts in the Devaswom Board,\n\nfor which the Recruitment Board shall prepare select list for\n\nappointment of candidates to various posts, other than hereditary\n\nposts and posts in aided educational institutions in the Devaswom\n\nBoards, as per the provisions of the said Act, Rules and Regulations\n\nframed thereunder.\n\n 40. We have already extracted the full contents of \nSec.9\n.\n\nThe provisions contained in Sub \nSections 2\n & \n3\n of \nSec.9\n may\n\nbroadly indicate that those provisions are mainly dealing with\n\n'examination', that may have to be conducted by the Recruitment\n\nBoard, in the context of selection to direct recruitment to various\n\nposts. The term 'examination', appearing in Sub \nSections 1\n to \n4\n of\n\nSec.9\n, also has not been explicitly defined in the Act. Rule 2(b)\n\ndefines 'examination' to include written examination, practical\n\nexamination, physical efficiency test, oral test (interview) and any\n\nother test or examination, which the Board may deem fit to hold.\n\nTherefore, the said definition for 'examination', contained in\n\nRule 2(b) of the Rules, will also reinforce the view that the term\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..63..\n\n'examination', referred to in Clauses (ii), (iii) & (iv) of \nSec.9(1)\n as\n\nwell as Sub \nSections 2\n, \n3\n & \n4\n of \nSec.9\n, may be broadly used in the\n\ncontext of examination to the categories envisaged in Rule 2(b), for\n\nthe purpose of conducting selection for direct recruitment to\n\nvarious categories.\n\n 41. In that context, it is also relevant to bear in mind that\n\nRegulation 16\n of the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees\n\nRegulations, 1983, framed under \nSec.39\n of the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Act, 1978, specifically stipulates, as per Clause (a)\n\nthereof, that probationers working in any post shall be eligible for\n\npromotion to higher post, as per the provisions applicable to the\n\nemployees of the State Government. It has been contended by the\n\nwrit petitioners that Ext.P-7 is an Administrative Circular\n\nNo.1/2016 dated 05..5.2016, issued by the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board, purportedly under the provisions contained in\n\nSec.9(5) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015,\n\nand that Clause 5 of Part I of Ext.P-7, states that the criteria for\n\nselection by the Departmental Promotion Committee shall be merit\n\nand ability, by taking into consideration the 3 items mentioned\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..64..\n\nthereunder. It may be pertinent to refer to the contents of Clauses\n\n2 to 5 of Part I of Ext.P-7 Administrative Circular, which read as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"2. Promotion and appointment by transfer according to merit and\n ability.- Selection of candidates for appointment to selection categories\n or grades included in category (a) above shall be made by\n Departmental Promotion Committee which shall be constituted for\n each Devaswom Board.\n\n 3. As provided in Rule 3(3) of the Kerala Devasworn Recruitment\n Rules, 2015, the Departmental Promotion Committee shall consist of a\n Member, Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board as Chairman, a\n Member of the Devaswom Board who is the appointing authority for\n the post concerned and a Member nominated by Government. The\n Member of the Devaswom Board shall also be the Convener of the\n Committee.\n\n 4. The Departmental Promotion Committee shall meet periodically to\n prepare select lists, in the order of merit, of the officers selected for\n promotion. Whenever necessity arises, the Committee may also hold\n ad hoc meetings for the purpose of making selection to particular\n posts.\n\n 5. The criterion for selection shall be merit and ability of the Officers\n and their suitability shall be assessed taking into consideration the\n following:\n\n i. Annual Confidential Report (ACR) of the Officer for at least the\n preceding three years in the feeder category post;\n ii. Punishment awarded, if any;\n\n iii.Disciplinary actions pending, if any, while working in the feeder\n category;\n\n iv.Criminal/vigilance cases pending, if any:\"\n\n 42. Sec.9(5) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act\n\nenvisages that the Recruitment Board may issue general direction\n\nto Devaswom Boards, incidental to the functions of the Board,\n\nas are necessary for the conduct of examinations. It is argued\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..65..\n\nby the writ petitioners that, in view of the mandate contained in\n\nRegulation 16(a)\n of the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees\n\nRegulations, the rules applicable to Government servants will also\n\nbe applied in the case of promotions, and that therefore, the Rules\n\ncontained in the Kerala State & Subordinate Services Rules ('KS &\n\nSSR' for short) may also appropriately apply. It is argued that the\n\nRecruitment Board has also conceded, as per Clause 5 of Part I of\n\nExt.P-7 Administrative Circular, that the criterion for promotion\n\nto selection post will be on the basis of the items mentioned\n\nthereunder, which is broadly similar to the norms in the KS & SSR\n\napplicable for Government servants. Consequently, it is argued\n\nthat the abovesaid criteria for promotion to selection post,\n\nconceded to by the Recruitment Board, cannot be envisaged as\n\nfulfilling the basic definition of 'examination', as contained in Rule\n\n2(b) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Rules, etc. Hence,\n\nit is argued by the writ petitioners that the provisions contained in\n\nthe Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act and the Rules\n\nframed thereunder would confer powers and functions to the\n\nRecruitment Board, only in respect of selections to be carried out\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..66..\n\non the basis of the method of direct recruitment in Devaswom\n\nBoards, and not in the case of other methods of appointments like\n\npromotion and by-transfer, etc. The essence of the argument is\n\nthat the Recruitment Board can conduct any selection only on the\n\nbasis of 'examination', as conceived in the Act and the Rules, and\n\nsince the examination conceived in terms of Rule 2(b) and the\n\nnorms for promotion to selection post as conceived in \nRegulation\n\n16(a)\n of the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations, 1983\n\nread with the KS & SSR are different and distinct. The inevitable\n\nfall out is that the Recruitment Board cannot have any power and\n\nfunction in relation to other methods of appointment like\n\npromotion and by-transfer appointment, for both selection posts\n\nas well as non-selection posts.\n\n 43. After hearing both sides, we are of the view that the\n\nabovesaid contentions of the writ petitioners are not tenable for\n\nreasons more than one. \nSec.9(1)(i)\n conceives that the Board shall\n\nhave the function to prepare select list for appointment of\n\ncandidates to various posts mentioned therein. Clauses (ii), (iii) &\n\n(iv) of \nSec.9(1)\n are in the matter of conduct of written examination,\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..67..\n\ninterview and to prepare select list. The examinations like written\n\nexamination, interview, physical efficiency test etc., conceived as\n\nper Rule 2(b) of the Rules, may ordinarily apply only in relation to\n\nselection by the method of appointment by direct recruitment. It\n\nmay be true that, in view of the stipulation contained in \nRegulation\n\n16(a)\n of the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations, 1983,\n\nthe norms as per the KS & SSR may also apply in the context of\n\npromotions. True that the norms as per the KS & SSR for\n\npromotion to selection posts, to be effected by the DPC, does not\n\nenvisage any written examination, interview, oral test, physical\n\nefficiency test, etc which are ordinarily meant for selection by\n\ndirect recruitment. Merely because the term 'examination',\n\nappearing in Clauses (ii) to (iv) of \nSec.9(1)\n and Sub \nSections 2\n to \n5\n\nof \nSec.9\n, may be only in relation to selection by the method of\n\ndirect recruitment, that by itself will not take away the powers and\n\nfunctions of the Recruitment Board, in the matter of preparing\n\nselect list for appointments other than direct recruitment.\n\n 44. As mentioned hereinabove, there is no dispute that the\n\nprovisions of the abovesaid Act and Rules would certainly apply for\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..68..\n\nselection by the method of direct recruitment. It is possibly,\n\nunderstanding these aspects, about the impact of \nRegulation 16(a)\n\nof the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations, 1983, that\n\nthe Recruitment Board has also consciously framed the criteria for\n\npromotion to selection post, based on merit-cum-suitability, in\n\nterms of Clause 5 of Part I of Ext.P-7 Administrative Circular,\n\nwhich appears to be broadly in consonance with the corresponding\n\nnorms in the KS & SSR, meant for promotion to selection posts of\n\nGovernment servants. So long as the method of appointment\n\ninvolves the preparation of a select list, then the role and function\n\nof the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board cannot be, in any\n\nmanner, belitted and diluted. The term 'select list' may apply not\n\nonly in relation to selection by direct recruitment, as can be seen\n\nfrom Rule 2(h), but the same will also apply in relation to\n\npromotion to selection post, as opposed to promotion to non\n\nselection list. The provisions contained in the KS & SSR also speaks\n\nabout the select list to be prepared by the DPC, for effectuating\n\npromotion to selection post by the method of merit and ability,\n\nwhere seniority comes into play, and only where merit and ability\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..69..\n\nare approximately meagre. Both the terms 'examination' and\n\n'select list', appearing in the Act, have not been defined in the Act.\n\nThe said terms 'examination' and 'select list' have been defined as\n\nper Rule 2(b) and 2(h), respectively, of the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Rules, 2015, framed under the 2015 Act.\n\nIt may be true that the term 'examination', appearing in Rule 2(b),\n\nmay broadly and predominantly apply in relation to selection by\n\ndirect recruitment. But, the term 'select list', appearing in the\n\nObjective portion and Preamble of the Act as well as in the other\n\nprovisions, as in \nSec.9(1)(i)\n, \nSec.9(4)\n etc., will have to be\n\nunderstood in a more broader and more inclusive manner, than in\n\nthe narrow manner, defined as per Rule 2(h) of the Rules.\n\n 45. This we say so, as, technically, the process of interview\n\nand examination, envisaged in Rule 2(h), may not be part of the\n\nnorms conceived in \nRegulation 16(a)\n for promotion read with the\n\nKS & SSR, even for selection post. The term 'select list' will have to\n\nbe, therefore, fully and properly understood in the context. This is\n\nall the more so, since the previous legislation, which governed the\n\nfield in respect of the two important Devaswoms in the State,\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..70..\n\nnamely, the Travancore Devaswom Board and the Cochin\n\nDevaswom Board, was the Kerala Public Service Commission\n\n(Additional Functions as Respects the Administrative Services\n\nunder Devaswom Boards) Act, 2008 (State Act 19 of 2008), whereby\n\nthe selection process was entrusted to the Kerala Public Service\n\nCommission ('PSC' for short). The said Act was later repealed in the\n\nyear 2014. As per the said Act, the PSC was entrusted only with the\n\nduty and function of selection by direct recruitment to the post of\n\nOfficers and Employees of the Administrative Services of the two\n\nDevaswoms mentioned above. Whereas, the present Act would\n\napply not only to the said two Devaswoms, but also to certain other\n\nDevaswoms including Guruvayoor Devaswom.\n\n 46. The present Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act,\n\n2015, uses a more broader and more inclusive language and\n\nterminology, both in the Objective portion as well as in the\n\nPreamble, and in the crucial provisions as in \nSecs.9(1)(i)\n, \n9(4)\n, etc\n\nof the said Act compared with the corresponding provisions in the\n\nState Act 19 of 2008 as in Sub Section (1) of \nSec.3\n as well as in\n\nClauses (a) & (b) of Sub Section (2) of \nSec.3\n thereof, which is\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..71..\n\nconfined only in the process of selection by direct recruitment. The\n\npresent phraseology and language employed in the Objective\n\nportion as well as in the Preamble and in \nSec.9(1)(i)\n & Sec.9(4) of\n\nthe Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015, is that the\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board has been constituted for preparing\n\nselect list of candidates for appointment in various posts other\n\nthan hereditary posts and posts in the aided educational\n\ninstitutions in the Devaswom Boards, etc. So long as the process\n\ninvolved is the one like the select list for effecting method of\n\nappointment, such process of making select list for the said\n\nmethod of appointment would also be covered in the said Act,\n\neven if the said method of appointment is other than direct\n\nrecruitment.\n\n 47. So, in other words, the next question is as to the scope\n\nand ambit of the process of preparation of select list for other\n\nmethods of appointment like promotion and by-transfer. We have\n\nalready dealt with the legal position well settled by a series of\n\ndecisions rendered by the Apex Court on the subject, and about the\n\ninclusional distinction between 'promotion to selection post' and\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..72..\n\n'promotion to non selection post', where the criteria for\n\nappointment of in-service candidates by promotion or by-transfer\n\nis, by the criteria of merit and ability. Seniority will come into play\n\nonly when merit and ability are prospectively equal. Then, the\n\nprocess involved is promotion or by-transfer appointment to\n\nselection posts. For other criteria like seniority-cum-fitness,\n\nseniority, etc, there is no question of making any assessment or\n\nmerit, and the senior person, who is ordinarily eligible and\n\nqualified, has to be considered for promotion, subject to the\n\nrejection of the unfit.\n\n 48. There is yet another important aspect of the matter. The\n\nKerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and the Rules\n\nframed thereunder, have been framed mainly for constituting the\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board for preparation of select list of\n\ncandidates for appointment in various posts other than hereditary\n\nposts and posts in aided educational institutions under the\n\nDevaswom Board in the State of Kerala, and for matters connected\n\ntherewith or incidental thereto. None of the provisions of said Act\n\nconfer power to the Board to frame any rules or regulations on the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..73..\n\nconditions of service of the Administrator and other officers and\n\nemployees of the Devaswom, and other aspects like minimum\n\nqualification required to hold the post, the method of appointment\n\netc, which would all continue to remain within the province of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n, on the designated authorities\n\nconstituted thereunder. Since, the power and function of selection,\n\nfor making select list is conferred on the Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard, as per the Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, the\n\nprovisions contained in \nSec.19\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act,\n\nas in \nSecs.19(3)\n, \n19(4)\n etc regarding selection of the officers and\n\nother employees of the Devaswom, to the extent it is entrusted to\n\nthe Devaswom Recruitment Board as per the 2015 Act, would be\n\neffected and modulated.\n\n 49. For instance, prior to the commencement of the 2015 Act,\n\nthe aspects relating to selection of the officers and employees of the\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom could be made by the sub committees\n\nconstituted by the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee\n\nfrom amongst its members as per \nSec.19(3)\n, and subject to the\n\nprovisions of \nSecs.1\n, \n2\n & \n3\n of the 1978 Act, the procedure for\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..74..\n\nselection and appointment of the officers and other employees of\n\nthe Devaswom shall be such as determined by the Managing\n\nCommittee, by the regulations made in that behalf. Those aspects\n\nrelating to the selection process, which are otherwise available\n\nunder \nSec.19(3)\n & \n19(4)\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, could\n\nbe effected and modulated to the extent that the process of\n\npreparing select list is conferred on the Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard. That is a clear impact of the non-obstante clause contained\n\nin \nSec.9(1)\n of the 2015 Act.\n\n 50. A perusal of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board\n\nAct and the Rules framed thereunder would make it clear that, the\n\nsaid Recruitment Board is not given any power to frame any\n\nregulations or rules for regulating the conditions of service of the\n\nofficers and employees of the Devaswoms, or to lay down the\n\nminimum qualification, and methods of appointment to various\n\nposts under the Devaswom. Those aspects of the matter, relating to\n\nconditions of service, prescription of condition of service,minimum\n\nqualification, methods of appointment to various posts, etc., would\n\ncontinue to be within the sole province of the 1978 Act, and not\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..75..\n\nunder the 2015 Act. The said fine distinction, by way of\n\ncompartmentalization, has to be clearly kept in mind, inasmuch as\n\nthe impact of the 2015 Act is for conferring powers and functions\n\nto the Recruitment Board, for preparing select lists of various\n\nappointments under the Devaswoms mentioned therein. To that\n\nextent, \nSecs.19(3)\n & \n19(4)\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n\ncould be abridged and modulated. Hence, we are of the firm view\n\nthat, where the process involves provisions of select lists, the same\n\ncan be, not only for selection by way of direct recruitment, but also\n\nbe for preparation of select list by the Departmental Promotion\n\nCommittee ('DPC' for short), for effectuating promotion to selection\n\nposts, on the criteria of merit and ability, wherein seniority can\n\nplay a role only when merit and ability are approximately equal.\n\n 51. This is all the more reinforced by the provisions\n\ncontained in Rule 3 of Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Rules,\n\n2015. Rule 3(1) stipulates that the Board shall have the power to\n\nprepare select list for the appointment of candidates in various\n\nposts, except hereditary posts, coming under the various\n\nDevaswom Boards and the Managing Committees. Sub Rule (2) of\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..76..\n\nRule 3 is in relation to direct recruitment and the provisions for\n\ncommunity reservation, and we are not concerned with that. Rule\n\n3(3) is very important and cardinal, and the same reads as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"(3) The candidates for appointment to the selection categories\n and grades of the service shall be chosen by the deparmental\n promotion committee consittuted by the Board. The Deparmental\n Promotion Committee shall consist of one member from the Board as\n Chairman, a member of the Devaswom Board as member and\n Convener and a member nominated by the Government. \"\n\n 52. Rule 3(3) clearly mandates that candidates for\n\nappointment to the selection categories and grades of service shall\n\nbe chosen by the DPC constituted by the Board, and the DPC shall\n\nconsist of one member from the Recruitment Board as Chairman,\n\na member of the Devaswom Board as a member and Convener, and\n\na member nominated by the Government. The first part of Rule\n\n3(3) would fully reinforce our abovesaid view and conclusion,\n\ninasmuch as it clearly mandates that candidates for appointment\n\nto the selection categories and grades of service shall be chosen by\n\nthe DPC constituted by the Recruitment Board. In other words, the\n\nprovisions contained in \nSec.9(1)(i)\n, \nSec.9(4)\n etc. of the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015, regarding preparation of\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..77..\n\nselect list for methods of appointment other than direct\n\nrecruitment, should be seen in the light of Rule 3(3) of the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Rules, 2015. That, the preparation\n\nof select list, for methods of appointment other than direct\n\nrecruitment, can be only for promotion to selection post, wherein\n\nthe criteria is merit and ability, and that seniority will come into\n\nplay only when merit and ability are approximately equal. The\n\nDPC concieved under Rule 3(3) is broadly analogous to the DPC\n\nconceived in Rule 28 of the KS & SSR Part II, except in its\n\nmembers constituting the same. In other words, even for methods\n\nof appointment other than direct recruitment, where the method of\n\nappointment is promotion or by-transfer, then the power and\n\nfunction of the Recruitment Board will come into play for\n\npreparation of select list through the DPC process, for effectuating\n\npromotion to selection post, on the criteria of merit and ability as\n\nabove.\n\n 53. The abovesaid aspects are broadly in tune with the\n\nanalogous provisions envisaged in \nRegulation 16(a)\n of the\n\nGuruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations, 1983, and read with\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..78..\n\nKS & SSR Part II. In other words, we are also equally and firmly of\n\nthe view that for methods of appointment like promotion and by-\n\ntransfer to non selection posts, wherein the criteria is other than\n\nmerit and ability like seniority, seniority-cum-fitness etc, then\n\nthere is no question of any select list of promotion or by-transfer\n\nappointment to selection post, inasmuch as, they are all non\n\nselection posts. Then, there is no question of preparation of any\n\nselect list, as per the provisions contained in the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015, and the Rules framed thereunder. In\n\nother words, so long as the method of appointment is direct\n\nrecruitment or by the method of promotion or by-transfer to\n\nselection posts, wherein the criteria is merit and ability as above,\n\nthen certainly, the role and function of the Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard would come into play, and the non obstante provision\n\ncontained in \nSec.9(1)\n will have its full amplitude vis-a-vis the other\n\nenactments like the \nGuruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978\n, etc This is\n\nsubject to the scenario that the Recruitment Board does not have\n\nthe power or prescription in the matter of conditions of service,\n\nminimum qualifications, methods of appointment etc as per the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..79..\n\n2015 Act, which would all continue to be within the province of the\n\n1978 Act.\n\n 54. This conclusion is all the more justified as it is an\n\nelementary aspect of the Service Law that, where the appointing\n\nauthority and the selection authority are distinct and separate such\n\nas the State Government, State Public Service Commission, etc then,\n\nthe matters in relation to prescriptions of conditions of service,\n\nminimum qualifications, methods of appointment etc could be\n\nwithin the domain of the appointing authority, and the selection\n\nauthority may not have the power in the matter of prescription of\n\nconditions of service, minimum qualifications, methods of\n\nappointment, etc., except consultation, if it is mandated by the\n\napplicable law.\n\n 55. During the course of hearing, we had repeatedly queried\n\nto both the State Government as well as to the Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board as to whether they have a case that the role and\n\nfunction of the Recruitment Board would apply not only in relation\n\nto promotion and by-transfer appointments to selection posts, but\n\nalso to non selection posts wherein the criteria for appointment is\n\nseniority, seniority-cum-fitness, etc. The learned Senior\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..80..\n\nGovernment Pleader, appearing for the respondent State\n\nGovernment, has fairly submitted before us that he had consulted\n\nwith the Advocate General, and that the abovesaid views observed\n\nby us, in the course of hearing, is tenable and sustainable, etc.\n\nHowever, despite repeated queries, we did not get any specific and\n\nprecise answer from the Devaswom Recruitment Board, and in one\n\nof the previous occasions, the answer appeared to be a little bit\n\nevasive. This may be presumably on account of the stand taken by\n\nthe Devaswom Recruitment Board, in Ext.P-7 Administrative\n\nCircular No.1 /2016 dated 5.5.2016, wherein Clauses 1(b) & 1(c) of\n\nPart I thereof speak about posts to which promotions shall be given\n\naccording to seniority, subject to a person's fitness for promotion,\n\nand posts to which promotions will be given on the basis of\n\nseniority alone, respectively. That is the criteria of seniority-cum-\n\nfitness and seniority, etc. Clause 1(a), Clause 2 and the subsequent\n\nClauses appear to be in relation to promotion and appointment\n\nby-transfer, according to merit and ability.\n\n 56. It is recited in Ext.P-7 Administrative Circular that the\n\nsame is issued purportedly, with reference to the provisions\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..81..\n\ncontained in Sec.9(5) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard Act, 2015. Sec. 9(5) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard Act, 2015 envisages that the Recruitment Board may issue\n\ngeneral directions to the Devaswom Boards, incidental to the\n\nfunctions of the Board, as are necessary for the conduct of\n\nexaminations.\n\n 57. We have already held that the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Rules, 2015, have been framed as per SRO\n\nNo.352/2015, published in Kerala Gazette No.1303 dated\n\n30.5.2015. So, Rule 3(3) of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n\nBoard Rules, 2015 has been in the statute book since 30.5.2015,\n\nand the same has not been amended or altered in the manner\n\nknown to law. Rule 3(3) clearly mandates that it is only candidates\n\nfor appointment to the selection categories and grades of the\n\nservice that is assigned to the DPC constituted by the Recruitment\n\nBoard. None of the provisions contained in the Act and the Rules,\n\neven remotely envisage that the Recruitment Board has any power\n\nor function to deal with promotion and by-transfer appointments,\n\nwhere the method of appointment is other than merit and ability.\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..82..\n\nIn other words, the 2015 Act and the Rules framed thereunder does\n\nnot confer any power to deal with promotion and by-transfer\n\nappointment to non selection posts, where the criteria for\n\nappointment is seniority, seniority-cum-fitness, etc. and in such\n\ncases, there is no question of the process of preparation of select\n\nlist arising at all. So, it has to be observed that the Recruitment\n\nBoard may have power to issue incidental directions, as per Ext.P7,\n\nsubject to \nRegulation 16(a)\n and Government norms like KS & SSR\n\nfor selection posts to the Devaswom Boards in matters relating to\n\nselection processes by the method of appointment of direct\n\nrecruitment or by the method of appointment by promotion or\n\nby-transfer, wherein the criteria is merit and ability, as above, and\n\nnot to non selection posts. Hence, it is only to be mentioned that\n\nthe understanding of the Recruitment Board, as reflected in Ext.P7\n\nAdministrative Circular, is that they even have power to deal with\n\npromotion and by-transfer appointments to non selection posts,\n\nwherein the criteria is seniority, seniority-cum-fitness etc., is\n\nuntenable and unsustainable in law and ultravires and the position\n\nin that regard is declared. The power to take decision to effect such\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..83..\n\npromotions and by-transfer appointments to all non-selection\n\nposts will be exclusively with the Guruvayur Devaswom Managing\n\nCommittee.\n\n 58. As mentioned hereinabove, the crucial aspect of the\n\nmatter is as to whether the process effected by the Recruitment\n\nBoard is the one which directly and substantially involved the\n\nprocess of preparation of select list for appointment to various\n\nposts, as discussed hereinabove. At the same time, we would also\n\nmake it clear that, so long as the process is one in relation to\n\npreparation of select list, as above, then duties and functions can\n\nbe conferred on the Recruitment Board to deal with the incidental\n\nissues of selection processes in such matters, but subject to\n\nRegulation 16(a)\n and Government norms like KS & SSR for\n\nselection posts.\n\n 59. Now, we will have to deal with yet another contention\n\nraised by the writ petitioners. The stand taken by the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom Board Managing Committee in Ext.P-13 is that, as far\n\nas the employees appointed to the services of the Guruvayoor\n\nDevaswom, prior to the coming into force of the Kerala Devaswom\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..84..\n\nRecruitment Board Act, 2015, are concerned, they will be governed\n\nby the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations, 1983, which\n\nwas in vogue at the time when they had entered service. In other\n\nwords, the contention is that, for the employees appointed to the\n\nservice of the Guruvayoor Devaswom, prior to 1.3.2014 (date of\n\ncoming into force of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015) ,\n\nthe provisions contained in the said 2015 Act and the Rules framed\n\nthereunder will not apply, and such employees will be governed by\n\nthe Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations, 1983, as the\n\nsame was in vogue at the time when they had entered into service,\n\netc.\n\n 60. We are not prepared to accept the said contention of\n\nthe Guruvayoor Devaswom Board and the writ petitioners, as\n\nreferred to in Ext.P-13, for reasons more than one. It is by now well\n\nsettled that the right to be considered for promotion is only a right\n\nto be so considered in accordance with law. There is no general law\n\nthat an employee has the right to be considered for higher\n\npromotion, by way of promotion or by-transfer appointments, in\n\naccordance with the rules and norms that existed at the time when\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..85..\n\nthey had entered into service in the initial entry posts. Ordinarily,\n\nwhere the rules and norms stipulate qualifications for promotion,\n\nthen the issue as to whether the claimants for promotion have\n\nacquired those qualifications and eligibility conditions, as per the\n\nrules and norms, will have to be adjudged with reference to the\n\nstate of affairs that existed at the time of occurrence of vacancy,\n\nunless otherwise prescribed by the rules. However, where the rules\n\nand norms itself are subsequently altered, amended or newly\n\nintroduced, and promotions were not made initially at a time when\n\nthe pre-revised norms and rules were in vogue, even then, it is well\n\nestablished that the employee's right to be considered for\n\npromotion is, only a right to be considered for promotion, in\n\naccordance with the rule and norms that were in force at the time\n\nwhen the consideration for promotion was effected. {See \nDeepak\n\nAgarwal & Ors. v. State of U.P. & Ors.\n [(2011) 6 SCC 725]\n\nD.Reghu & Ors. v. B.Vasaveswarudu & Ors. [(2020) 2\n\nSCC 346], UOI & Ors. v. V.Krishnakumar & Ors. [(\n2019)\n\n4 SCC 319] and Dr.Ramalu v. Dr.S.S.Rao\n [(1997) 3 SCC\n\n59], etc.}\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..86..\n\n 61. When this is the well settled legal position in the\n\nmatter, there is no question of any employee claiming that he has\n\nthe right to be considered for promotion to a higher category of\n\npost, on the basis of the rules and norms in force at the time when\n\nhe had initially entered into service in the lower entry level post.\n\nSo, the abovesaid contention raised on behalf of the respondent\n\nGuruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee and the writ\n\npetitioners is only to be rejected as untenable and unsustainable.\n\n 62. Directions and orders to be issued in these cases:\n\nDuring the course of hearing in these cases, we were apprised that\n\nthe competent authority of the respondent State Government, in\n\nthe Revenue (Devaswom) Department, has issued Anx.R-1(a) G.O.\n\n(Rt.) No. 3244/2021/Rd. Dated 26.9.2021, ordering that Ext.P-13\n\nproceedings, issued by the respondent Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee, will stand cancelled and that the promotion\n\nlist, published by the DPC, constituted by the Recruitment Board,\n\nshould be effectuated by the Administrator, etc. Consequently,\n\nAnx.R-1(b) proceedings dated 29.9.2021 has also been issued by\n\nthe Administrator of the Guruvayoor Devaswom, in pursuance of\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..87..\n\nAnx.R-1(a) G.O. dated 26.9.2021. In the course of hearing in these\n\ncases, we made it clear that this appellate Court had never granted\n\nstay of operation of the impugned judgment rendered by the\n\nlearned Single Judge in the WP(C), and all what has been directed\n\nwas to be keep in abeyance the consequential judgment passed by\n\nthe learned Single Judge in the Contempt Case arising out of the\n\nWP(C). Hence, we expressed our opinion that the abovesaid\n\nunilateral act on the part of the State Government and the\n\nAdministrator, as per Anxs.R-1(a) & R-1(b), may amount to\n\noverreach of judicial process, inasmuch as the same may go against\n\nthe impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge in the WP(C),\n\nmore so particularly, as \nthe said judgment\n in the WP(C) has never\n\nbeen stayed in these appeals. We also made it clear that the said\n\nview expressed by us was not on the merits of the matter, but only\n\non account of the attitude shown by the respondent State\n\nGovernment and the Administrator in overreaching the judicial\n\nprocess, when the writ appeals are pending consideration and as\n\nthe judgment of the learned Single Judge in the WP(C) has not\n\nbeen stayed.\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..88..\n\n 63. So also, it has to be borne in mind that, the appointing\n\nauthority continues to be the Guruyoor Devaswom Managing\n\nCommittee, in accordance with the provisions contained in\n\nSec.19(1)\n of the Guruvayoor Devaswom Act, 1978 and \nRegulation\n\n16\n of the Guruvayur Devaswom Employees Regulations 1983,\n\nframed under the 1978 Act. The power of appointment is not, in\n\nany manner, vested with the Recruitment Board, and their\n\nfunction is to prepare select list for promotion to selection post, on\n\nthe basis of merit-cum-suitability criteria, and also selection for\n\ndirect recruitment, based on the advice or recommendation of the\n\nDPC/Recruitment Board, as the case may be, based on the advice\n\nmade by the DPC, constituted by the Recruitment Board, in the\n\nmatter of promotion or by-transfer appointment in selection posts,\n\nand the advice made by the Recruitment Board for direct\n\nrecruitment selections and it is for the appointing authority to\n\nissue the appointment order, etc.\n\n 64. Later, Sri.Antony Mukkath, learned Senior\n\nGovernment Pleader, had taken pro-active steps in the matter,\n\nafter seeking advice of the learned Advocate General, and\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..89..\n\nthereafter it was apprised to us that the Government has ordered\n\nto keep Anx.R-1(a) and the consequential proceedings in abeyance,\n\npending consideration of the appeals, and that it will be subject to\n\nthe result of the Writ Appeals, and that the Government will abide\n\nby the directions issued by this Court in that regard.\n\n 65. Further, Sri.K.Jaju Babu, learned Senior Counsel\n\ninstructed by the Sri.Brijesh Mohan, learned counsel appearing for\n\ncontesting respondents 1 to 3 in this appeal/writ petitioners, has\n\nalso pointed out that, even uncommunicated adverse entries of the\n\nwrit petitioners were relied on, to deny them promotion, by the\n\nDPC, constituted by the Recruitment Board, as per Ext.P-6, and\n\nfurther that all the Annual Confidential Reports ('ACRs' for short) of\n\nthe relevant period in consideration for the select list year\n\nconcerned, have not been taken into account, etc. Further, it was\n\nalso submitted on behalf of the petitioners that, they could reliably\n\nlearn that some or most of the adverse entries in their ACRs were\n\nalready been expunged and removed by the competent appointing\n\nauthority concerned, and even inspite of that, the DPC constituted\n\nby the Recruitment Board has not considered those aspects.\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..90..\n\n 66. We are of the firm view that the issuance of Anxs.R-1(a)\n\n& R-1(b) would amount to an overreach of the judicial process,\n\ninasmuch as the matters are pending consideration before the\n\nappellate Court, and the impugned judgment in the WP(C) has\n\nnever been stayed by the appellant Court. Merely because the\n\njudgment rendered by the learned Single Judge in the Contempt of\n\nCourt Case, arising out of the WP(C), was earlier stayed by this\n\nCourt, would not amount to the abovesaid authorities arrogating to\n\nthemselves the power to present fait accompli in pending matters.\n\nHence, it is ordered that Anx.R-1(a), issued by the State\n\nGovernment and Anx.R-1(b), issued by the Administrator, will be\n\npurely provisional and temporary, and the promotions, if any,\n\nordered thereon, shall be treated only as temporary or provisional\n\npromotions, and that by itself will not confer any right to such\n\ntemporary promotees. Further, the DPC, constituted by the\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board, in terms of Rule 3(3) of the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Rules, 2015, will immediately consider the\n\nmatters relating to promotion to selection posts, including the post\n\nof Manager, based on the settled finalized seniority and eligible\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..91..\n\nfield of choice, and also by taking into account only communicated\n\nentries in the ACRs. And if the previous adverse entries in the\n\nACRs of any of the incumbents, including the writ petitioners, have\n\nbeen expunged by the competent authority, then only such revised\n\nACRs should be taken into account in respect of such incumbents.\n\nThereafter, the DPC will carefully proceed in the matter, after\n\nascertaining all these relevant aspects, and then may proceed to\n\nconsider effecting regular promotion to selection posts, including\n\nthe post of Manager, on the basis of the criteria of merit and\n\nsuitability, as above, and then do the entire exercise afresh,\n\nuntrammelled and uninfluenced in any manner, by their actions\n\npreviously effected in Ext.P-6, Anx.R-1(a), Anx.R-1(b) etc.\n\n 67. This has to be done independently and strictly in\n\naccordance with law, and this exercise would be confined only for\n\npromotion or by-transfer appointment to selection posts, wherein\n\nthe criteria is on the basis of merit cum suitability. Seniority will\n\ncome into play only when merit and suitability are equal or\n\napproximately equal. The said DPC, constituted by the\n\nRecruitment Board, will not have any role to consider promotion\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..92..\n\nor by-transfer appointment to non selection posts, where the\n\ncriteria is merit and ability like seniority, seniority-cum-fitness etc.\n\n 68. The abovesaid exercise of consideration of regular\n\npromotion to the selection post of Manager, by the criteria of merit\n\nand ability, should be duly finalized by the DPC within 2 months\n\nfrom the date of production of a certified copy of this judgment.\n\n 69. Before that, the incumbents including the writ petitioners,\n\nwill be at liberty to place their aspects in the matter before the\n\nappointing authority, like matters relating to their ACRs, expunged\n\nACRs, seniority position etc, and the appointing authority will give a\n\ndetailed and precise report to the DPC, to enable them to ascertain\n\nall relevant and correct facts, and it is thereafter that the DPC\n\nshould finalize the regular promotion to the selection post of\n\nManager, in the manner indicated hereinabove.\n\n 70. The appointing authority and the DPC will ensure that\n\nall necessary care and precaution shall be taken to ensure that\n\ncomplaints, in the present nature, are avoided, so that only\n\ncommunicated entries in the ACRs are relied on and the ACRs of\n\nthe relevant years are duly taken into account and the expunged\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..93..\n\nACRs and the reversed/revised ACRs, based on the expunged\n\nadverse remarks alone, should be taken into account, etc.\n\n 71. There is yet another aspect of the matter to be\n\nconsidered by this Court. The appeallant in W.A. No.1042/2021,\n\nwho was the Administrator of the Devaswom, at the relevant time,\n\nhad also filed Contempt Appeal (Civil) No.2/2021, to impugn the\n\njudgment dated 30.7.2021, rendered by the learned Single Judge in\n\nCont. Case(C) No.1081/2021 (arising out the instant impugned\n\njudgment dated 24.6.2021 in WP(C).No. 10135/2021).\n\n 72. Initially we had granted stay in the said Contempt\n\nAppeal. Later, when the Contempt Appeal had come up for\n\nconsideration on 22.12.2021, it is submitted by Sri.P.B. Krishnan,\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the appellant in the said Contempt\n\nAppeal, on the basis of instructions, that his party has already filed\n\na separate application in the Contempt Appeal, seeking leave of\n\nthis Court to withdraw the above Contempt Appeal, inasmuch as\n\nthe appellant has already retired from service, and that the\n\nContempt Appeal may be dismissed as withdrawn. Accordingly,\n\nthis Court recorded the abovesaid submission of the appellant\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..94..\n\ntherein, and has ordered that the interim stay order dated\n\n20.9.2021 rendered by this Court in the Contempt Appeal will\n\nstand vacated, and that the above Contempt Appeal will stand\n\ndismissed as withdrawn.\n\n 73. We specifically queried as to whether the said appellant,\n\nin W.A. No.1042/2021, has filed the said Writ Appeal in his official\n\ncapacity as the Administrator or not. The learned Standing Counsel\n\nfor the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee has apprised\n\nus that the Guruvayoor Devaswom Managing Committee has never\n\nauthorized the said Administrator to file any Writ Appeal, as above,\n\nand that the said Appeal may have been filed by the said official in\n\nhis individual capacity, even though it is shown in the Appeal that it\n\nhas been filed by him as the Administrator.\n\n 74. Sri.P.B.Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant in W.A. No.1042/2021, had submitted before us, on the\n\nbasis of instructions, that the said appellant had filed the said Writ\n\nAppeal not to challenge any decision of the Guruvayoor Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee, but that, since his predecessor had earlier\n\ngiven an undertaking before the Apex Court, stating that all\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..95..\n\nappointments in the Guruvayoor Devaswom will be made only in\n\naccordance with the provisions contained in the Kerala Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Act, etc, he was advised that if the impugned\n\njudgment of the learned Single in this WP(C) were implemented,\n\nthen, it would amount to violation of the above undertaking, and it\n\nis only for that purpose, to safeguard him from any Contempt\n\nproceedings, he had filed the above Writ Appeal and later the\n\nabove Contempt Appeal as well.\n\n 75. Further, Sri.P.B.Krishnan, learned counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellant in W.A. No.1042/2021, would also apprise us that\n\nsince the said Administrator had subsequently retired from service,\n\nand he has duly protected his rights and interests, in regard to his\n\nposition, and if the judgment of the learned Single Judge is upheld,\n\npartly or fully, further action in that regard may have to be taken\n\nby his successor and not by him, and therefore, the Contempt\n\nAppeal became unnecessary, due to his retirement and hence, he\n\nhad withdrawn the said Contempt Appeal, etc. This is the admitted\n\ncase of the said appellant in Contempt Appeal (Civil) No. 2/2021\n\n(who is also the appellant in W.A. No. 2014/2021 ). Hence, going\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..96..\n\nby the abovesaid specific case of the party, it is only to be held that\n\nthe present W.A. No.1042/2021 filed by him, not in his official\n\ncapacity but in his individual capacity, has also become\n\nunnecessary, in view of his retirement. Hence, we indicated to\n\nSri.P.B.Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the said appellant\n\nthat, that being so, it may not be proper for us to entertain the said\n\nwrit appeal on merits, and that the said Writ Appeal No.1042/2021\n\nis only to be dismissed as withdrawn, as has been done in the case\n\nof Contempt Appeal (Civil) No.2/2021.\n\n 76. Sri.P.B.Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant in W.A. No.1042/2021, has further submitted on the\n\nbasis of instructions that, his party has no objection to the said\n\ncourse of action.\n\n 77. In the light of these aspects, it is only to be ordered that\n\nW.A. No.1042/2021 is only to be dismissed as unnecessary for the\n\nabove reasons and the same need not be entertained any further.\n\n 78. Issues not decided by this Court in this case:\n\nSri.K.Jaju Babu, learned senior counsel instructed by Sri.Brijesh\n\nMohan, learned counsel appearing for contesting respondents 1 to 3\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..97..\n\nin W.A./writ petitioners, would submit that Rule 3(3) of the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Rules, 2015, empowers the Recruitment\n\nBoard to constitute the DPC, wherein one member thereof is from\n\nthe Recruitment Board as Chairman of the DPC, another member\n\nis of the Devaswom Board as a member and Convener of the DPC,\n\nand one member will be nominated by the Government. Hence, it\n\nis submitted before us that the majority of the members in the said\n\nDPC are not representatives of the Guruvarur Devaswom\n\nBoard/Managing Committee.\n\n 79. In that regard, it is pertinently argued that, even in\n\nGovernment appointments, direct recruitment is entrusted with an\n\noutside selection agency, like the State Public Service Commission,\n\nin the case of State Services, Union Public Service\n\nCommission/Staff Selection Commission, in the case of the Union\n\nGovernment Services etc. But, consistently, for appointments by\n\npromotion or by-transfer of in-service employees to higher\n\ncategory posts, be it especially for selection posts, the DPC will\n\nconsist of 3 members, out of which 2 members would be\n\nrepresenting the appointing authority and only 1 member will be\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..98..\n\nan outsider who is normally the member of the PSC, etc.\n\n 80. Further that, ordinarily, it may be that direct\n\nrecruitment may have to be effected predominantly from all\n\noutsiders, and even the employer/appointing authority may not be\n\nhaving any knowledge or exposure to open candidates who are\n\noutsiders, and the appointing authority/employer may not also\n\nhave the proper ways and means of assessing the merits of such\n\nopen candidates for effecting direct recruitment selection,\n\nespecially in the matter of conduct of written competitive\n\nexamination, interview and other tests. That, it is to ensure that\n\nthese deficiencies of the appointing authority/employer are\n\nremedied while effecting the method of direct recruitment, that\n\nmany a time, ordinarily, the power of selection may be entrusted to\n\nan outside agency like the Union or State Public Service\n\nCommission etc, who are specilized agencies who have the means\n\nand equipments to properly conduct written examination,\n\ninterview and other tests, to assess the merits of the candidates of\n\ndirect recruitment. But, such is not the state of affairs in the case of\n\npromotion/by-transfer appointments of in-service employees in\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..99..\n\nany organization. Further that, ordinarily, the appointing\n\nauthority/employer will be having more intimate knowledge and\n\nexposure about their in-service employees, and they are best\n\nequipped to handle career advancement aspects like promotion,\n\nby-transfer appointments etc. of the in-service employees. Further\n\nthat, the said aspect of control and regulation of such in-service\n\ncareer advancement appointments have to be vested with the\n\nappointing authority, as it is also part of their prerogative\n\nmanagerial rights as the employer.\n\n 81. It is in view of these aspects that ordinarily, even while\n\nconstituting DPCs, for promotion or by-transfer appointments for\n\nselection posts, on the basis of merit-cum-suitability, the majority of\n\nthe members would be representing the appointing authority, and\n\nonly one member may ordinarily be representing an outside agency,\n\nlike the PSC or an expert selection agency. In the instant case, the\n\nsaid cardinal aspect of the matter has been completely violated,\n\ninasmuch as only one member of the DPC is representing the\n\nDevaswom. The other 2 members are outsiders, inasmuch as they\n\nare not representatives of the employer Devaswom. In that regard,\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..100..\n\nthe writ petitioners/respondents 1, 2 & 3 have also urged the\n\nfollowing contentions in paras 5, 6 & 7 of the reply affidavit dated\n\n7.12.2021 filed by them in W.A. No.1042/2021, which read as\n\nfollows:-\n\n \"5. Originally, Section 20 of the Guruvayur Devaswom Board\n Act 1971 provided for the appointment of officers and other\n employees. As per the said provision appointment of all officers\n and employees of the temple were to be made by a Board\n consisting of (a) the Commissioner who shall be the Chairman (b)\n the Administrator (c) an Officer professing Hindu Religion\n authorised by the District Collector, Thrissur in that behalf and two\n persons selected by the Committee from amongst its members.\n Thus the composition of the committee was such that there was an\n over-whelming predominance of the Government nominees. The\n Full Bench of this Hon'ble Court found that in so far as \nSection 20\n\n confers the power of appointment of officers and employees of the\n temple not on the Managing Committee but on a separate and\n independent body namely the Board it must be held that the section\n is violative of \nArticle 26(a)(b)\n and (d) of the Constitution of India\n (1979 KLT 350 FB).\n\n 6. Thereafter, the Guruvayur Devaswom Act 1978 was\n promulgated which came into force on 19.03.1978. Section 19 of the\n Guruvayur Devaswom Act 1978 (in short the Act) provides for the\n appointment of officers and employees, which reads as follows;\n\n 19. Appointment of officers and employees.-\n\n (1) Appointment of all officers and other employees of the\n Devaswom shall be made by the Committee.\n (2) Ten % of the posts in each grade of the officers and other\n employees of the Devaswom shall be reserved for the Scheduled\n Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, of whcih on-fifth shall be reserved\n for the Scheduled Tribes.\n\n (3) Selection of the officers and other employees of the Devaswom\n may be made by sub-committee constituted by the Committee from\n among its members; Provided that selection of employees to be in\n charge of the rituals and other ceremonies of the Temple shall not\n be made by any sub-committee of which the Thantri of the Temple\n is not a member.\n\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..101..\n\n (4) Subject to the provisions of sub-sections (1), (2) and (3), the\n procedure for the selection and appointment of officers and other\n employees of Devaswom shall be such as may be determined by the\n Committee by regulations made in this behalf.\n\n 7. The scope of the above provision is again considered by the\n Full Bench of this Hon'ble Court in the decision reported in 1985\n KLT 629 (FB) as follows;\n\n \nSection 19\n of the Act invests the Committee with power to\n appoint all officers and other employees of the Devaswom.\n Selection of officers and employees is to be made by a sub-\n committee constituted by the Committee from among its members\n and the procedure for selection is to be determined by the\n Committee by regulations made in that behalf. \nS.19\n is in\n recognition of the right of the denomination to administer its\n properties. \nS.20\n of the Act requiring the Committee from time to\n time to submit to the Commissioner proposals for fixing the dittam\n or scale of expenditure to the Devaswom, publication of the\n proposals and scrutiny by the Commissioner with power of\n modification vested in him are all in the interests of the Devaswom\n and cannot be assailed as violative of \nArt.26(d)\n of the Constitution.\n Sub-s.(4) of\n S.20\n authorises the Committee to file a suit to set aside\n or modify any order passed by the Commissioner altering or\n modifying the proposals submitted by the Committee. The\n provisions of\n S.20\n are similar to the provisions of S.54 of the\n Madras H.R. & C.E. Act found valid by the Supreme Court in the\n Commr. H.R.E. v. L.T.Swamiar.\n\n \nSection 19\n is to be considered in recognition of the right of\n the denomination to adminster its properties and held valid. \"\n\n 82. Further it is also submitted by Sri.K.Jaju Babu, learned\n\nSenior Counsel, that the present provision made in the Kerala\n\nDevaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and the Devaswom\n\nRecruitment Board Rules, 2015 entrusting the power of\n\nappointment by promotion/by-transfer to selection posts, would\n\nbe nullifying the rights of administration guaranteed to religious\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..102..\n\ndenomination represented by the Guruvayoor Devaswom in terms\n\nof \nArticle 26\n of the Constitution of India. Further that, even the\n\nconstitution of the DPC making the provisions in the rules, in not\n\ngiving majority of the membership in the DPC to the\n\nrepresentatives of the Devaswom, would certainly amount to\n\nabridgement of the Constitutionally guaranteed Right under\n\nArticle 26\n of the Constitution of India, which is for the protection\n\nof religious denomination, and that the Devaswom is representing\n\nthe religious denomination as understood in \nArticle 26.\n\n \n83. Sri.P.B.Krishnan, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant would point out that the abovesaid contentions of the\n\nwrit petitioners based on \nArticle 26(d)\n of the Constitution of India\n\ncannot be claimed by them, and at any rate, the Apex Court in the\n\njudgment rendered in the case in \nM.P.Gopalakrishnan Nair &\n\nAnr. v. State of Kerala & Ors.\n [(2005) 11 SCC 45] has held\n\nthat such a Fundamental Right under \nArticle 26\n of the Constitution\n\nof India for religious denomination, could not be claimed in the\n\ncase of temple believers of Guruvayoor Devaswom, etc.\n\n 84. This contention is rebutted by the learned Senior\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..103..\n\nCounsel appearing for the writ petitioners, who would also make\n\nan alternate plea that, the very act of entrusting the power to the\n\nDPC, after taking it away from the appointing authority, and also\n\nthe act of not giving majority membership to the Devaswom\n\nManaging Committee in the DPC, would amount to an\n\nunreasonable action in taking away the power of said appointing\n\nauthority, and hence, would be violative of \nArticles 14\n \n& 16\n of the\n\nConstitution of India, for the earlier stated reasons etc.\n\n 85. We do not propose to adjudicate any of these issues, as\n\nthe same have not been directly and substantially raised in the\n\npresent writ proceedings. True, that some of these contentions\n\nhave been raised in the reply affidavit filed by the writ petitioners.\n\nHence, it is made clear that, in case the writ petitioners or any\n\nother aggrieved persons have any such issues, it is for them to raise\n\nthose matters in appropriate litigative writ proceedings and raise\n\nthem for adjudication in the manner known to law. Such liberty is\n\naccorded to the writ petitioners or any other aggrieved persons.\n\nWe make it clear that we have not examined the merits of those\n\nrival contentions and have only given liberty to raise it in\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..104..\n\nappropriate proceedings in the manner known to law.\n\n 86. Conclusions : The upshot of the above discussion is as\n\nfollows:-\n\n (i) There is no dispute that the provisions contained in the\n\n Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and the\n\n Rules framed thereunder, confer power and function to the\n\n said Recruitment Board to prepare select list, for effecting\n\n direct recruitment to various posts, conceived in terms of\n\n \nSec.9(1)\n, where the method of appointment to fill up such\n\n post, as per the Rules, is direct recruitment.\n\n (ii) In view of the non obstante clause contained in Sec.9(1)(i)\n\n of the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment Board Act, 2015 and\n\n the Rules framed thereunder, the Departmental Promotion\n\n Committee, constituted by the Recruitment Board, will\n\n have the power and function to prepare select lists for\n\n effecting appointment by way of promotion or by-transfer\n\n to selection posts, wherein the criteria is on the basis of\n\n merit and ability, and wherein seniority will come into play\n\n only when merit and ability are approximately equal, etc.\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..105..\n\n However, the said Recruitment Board or the DPC will not\n\n have the power or function in the case where the method\n\n of appointment is by promotion or by-transfer to non\n\n selection posts, wherein the criteria is other than merit\n\n and ability, especially when the criteria is seniority,\n\n seniority-cum-fitness etc. The power to take decisions to\n\n effect such promotion or by-transfer appointments to all\n\n non-selection posts will be exclusively with the Guruvayur\n\n Devaswom Managing Committee.\n\n (iii) The promotions ordered, as per Anx.R-1(a) G.O.\n\n (Rt.)No.3244/2021/Rd dated 26.9.2021 and the\n\n consequential Anx.R-1(b) proceedings No. B1-1255/2020\n\n dated 29.9.2021, issued by the Administrator of the\n\n Guruvayoor Devaswom, in pursuance of Ext.P-6 will be\n\n purely provisional and temporary, and no rights will be\n\n conferred on such temporary/provisional promotees, for\n\n the reasons stated hereinabove.\n\n (iv) The appointing authority will immediately give details of\n\n the seniority position, field of choice, details of the\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..106..\n\n communicated ACRs of the claimant incumbents, details\n\n of the expunged ACRs and the revised ACRs to the DPC\n\n constituted by the Recruitment Board under Rule 3(3)\n\n above, for the purpose of consideration by the DPC, for\n\n regular promotion to selection posts, including the post of\n\n Manager, without any further delay and this process may\n\n be completed immediately.\n\n (v) Thereafter, the DPC, constituted by the Recruitment\n\n Board, will consider the entire matter afresh, and take\n\n appropriate action regarding regular promotions to be\n\n made to selection posts, like Manager, etc and in that\n\n regard, it shall be ensured that only communicated\n\n adverse entries of the incumbents shall be taken into\n\n account, and expunged ACRs shall not be taken into\n\n account, and in this case, revised ACRs alone should be\n\n taken into account, and after taking into consideration all\n\n relevant aspects of the matter, the DPC will issue a fresh\n\n select list for promotion to such selection posts, like\n\n Manager, etc without any further delay, and the entire\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..107..\n\n process in that regard may be duly completed by the\n\n appointing authority and the DPC within 2 months from\n\n the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.\n\n (vi) The contentions of the writ petitioners, based on the\n\n alleged infringement of the Fundamental Rights of\n\n Religious Denomination in terms of \nArticle 26(d)\n of the\n\n Constitution of India, and also the alleged violation of\n\n \nArticles 14\n \n& 16\n of the Constitution of India, in view of the\n\n entrustment of promotion aspects of selection posts to the\n\n DPC, in which the Devaswom has only minority\n\n representation, are left open to be raised and decided by\n\n them in appropriate writ litigative proceedings, in the\n\n manner known to law. It is made clear that, such issues\n\n have not been decided by this Court in any manner.\n\n (vii) The impugned judgment dated 24.06.2021 in W.P.(C)\n\n No.10135/2021 will stand modified and substituted as\n\n above.\n\n With these observations and directions, the above\n\nW.A.No.1241/2021, filed by the Kerala Devaswom Recruitment\n W.A Nos.1042& 1241 of 2021\n\n ..108..\n\nBoard will stand finally disposed of as above. W.A. No.1042/2021\n\nwill stand dismissed as unnecessary for the above reasons.\n\n Sd/-\n\n ALEXANDER THOMAS,\n JUDGE\n\n Sd/-\n\n VIJU ABRAHAM,\n JUDGE\nSkk\nVGD\nMMG//V0\nVGD9042022\n\n APPENDIX OF WA 1241/2021\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES:-\n\nAnnexure A1 TRUE COPY OF THE MINUTES OF THE JOINT\n MEETING DATED 23.2.2018\nAnnexure A2 A COPY OF THE RESOLUTION DATED 23.3.2018\nAnnexure A3 TRUE COPY OF THE CIRCULAR NO.1 OF 2016\n DATED 5.5.2016\n\nRESPONDENT ANNEXURES:-\n\nAnnexure R1(A) TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT FILED IN\n CONT.CASE NO 2067/2021 FILED BY THE\n PRESENT ADMINISTRATOR ON 27.1.2022\nAnnexure R1(B) TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 27.1.2022 IN\n CON (C) NO 2067/2021 OF THIS HON'BLE\n COURT\n W.A.
