They have no issue out of the said wedlock. The opposite party no.2 is living with her parents since year 2005, due to alleged dispute between the husband and wife.\n\nb. On 11.10.2011, the applicant no.1 and the opposite party no.2 have agreed to live together in pursuance of the interim settlement, but they could not get along.\n\nc.

Application No. 8960 of 2011 and all disputes and differences in this regard have been amicably settled by the Parties hereto through the process of Conciliation/Mediation.\"\n\n19. On submitting the above settlement report dated 3.7.2013 by the Mediation and Conciliation Center before this Court in Criminal Misc. Application No. 8960 of 2011, this Court vide order dated 19.9.2018 passed the following order:-\n\n\"1. Learned counsel for the parties admitted that the dispute had been settled by the Mediation and Conciliation Centre vide Settlement Agreement dated 3.07.2013, whereunder the applicant No.1 was required to pay the opposite party No.2 a Sum of Rs. 5,75,000/-. It is also submitted that amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- were paid to opposite party No.2. Learned counsel for the parties are at variance as to the reason for non payment of Rs. 3,75,000/-. Without entering into merits of the rival claim in that regard, it is seen that more than five years have passed and the amount of Rs. 3,75,000/- has not been paid by the applicant.\n\n2. Consequently, it has been proposed by the court that subject to the total payment of Rs. 4,50,000/- on the next date to be fixed in the present proceeding, by means of bank draft in favour of the opposite party No.2, the present proceeding may be decided in terms of Settlement Agreement dated 3.07.2013.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the opposite party No.2 states that his client would be agreeable to such an offer and that subject to such payment being made on the next date the present applications may be allowed in terms of the Settlement Agreement dated 3.07.2013 and that opposite party No.2 would not further pursue any other claim against the applicants.\n\n4. Accordingly, list this along with all connected matter on 08.10.2018 in top 10 cases.\n\n5. Interim order granted earlier is extended till the next date of listing for the same reasons contained in the aforesaid order.\n\n6. It is also expected by the opposite party No.2 that she shall file a personal affidavit accepting the proposal as noted above.\"\n\n20. Learned counsel for the applicants has filed supplementary affidavit dated 19.12.2018 in Criminal Misc. Application No. 8960 of 2011 mentioning in paragraph no.3 of the said affidavit that applicant no.1 has deposited Rs. 4,50,000/- by means of Bank Draft in favour of opposite party no.2 in the light of settlement dated 03.07.2013. In paragraph nos. 4 and 6 of the supplementary affidavit averment has been made that in compliance of order dated 19.9.2018 of this Court parties concerned moved their joint affidavit under \nSection 13B\n of Hindu Marriage Act before the concerned family court on 20.11.2018. Copy of the said affidavit appended as Annexure no.1 to the supplementary affidavit. Pursuant to the said joint affidavit dated 20.11.2018 divorce decree has been passed by the judgment and decree dated 7.12.2018 on mutual agreement between the parties. Copy of the judgment and decree dated 7.12.2018 appended as Annexure no.2 to the supplementary affidavit.\n\n21. Record reveals that there is an endorsement of the office note dated 1.11.2018, which is reproduced herein as under:-\n\n\"Sealed envelope, containing Demand Draft No. 704820 dated 04.10.2018 of Rs. 4,50,000/- (four lacs fifty thousand) only in the name of Deepmala, deposited in compliance of orders dated 08.10.2018 and 24.10.2018 passed in Application U/s 482 No. 203 of 2016 - Kumari Rachna @ Jagriti & another Vs. State of U.P. & another [Criminal Misc. Application No. 8960 of 2011 - Anurag Dwivedi & another Vs. State of U.P. & others]\"\n\nSubmissions on behalf of the applicants\n \n\n22. Learned counsel for the applicants after placing the above facts with humbleness submitted that since the settlement took place between the parties and applicant no.1 has complied the order dated 19.9.2018 of this Court in true sense and spirit of law as directed by this Court. The learned counsel for the applicants also submitted that he is not pressing the applications on merit on account of compromise/settlement made between the parties, therefore, all the proceedings against the applicants initiated by wife of applicant no.1 or her father against the applicants (husband and his family members) regarding which eight criminal misc. applications are pending before this Court are liable to be quashed. \n\nSubmissions on behalf of opposite parties\n \n\n23. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party no.2 did not dispute the aforesaid arguments advanced on behalf of learned counsel for the applicants and also stated at the Bar that settlement between the parties has already been arrived and now opposite party no.2 (wife) and her family members have no grievance against the applicants of all the aforesaid eight pending criminal misc. application and they also do not want to continue the criminal proceedings against the them. It is submitted that in case, proceedings of all the pending criminal cases against the applicants/accused are quashed by this Court, the wife and her family members have no objection. The learned counsel for the wife also prayed to quash all the proceedings against the applicants.\n\n24. Learned A.G.A. also does not dispute the aforesaid submission advanced on behalf of the applicants and opposite party no.2.\n\nDiscussion of decided case laws\n \n\n25. The Apex Court in Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia and others V. Sambhaji-rao Chandrojirao Angre and others (1988) 1 SCC 692 held that while exercising inherent power of quashing under Section 482, it is for the High Court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case to consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue. Where, in the opinion of the Court, chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the Court, may, while taking into consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceedings.\n\n26. The observation of the Apex Court in \nG. V. Rao Vs. L.H.V. Prasad and others\n (2000) 3 SCC 693 are very apt for determining the approach required to be kept in view in matrimonial dispute by the Courts, it was said that there has been an outburst of matrimonial disputes in recent times. Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly extent which often assume serious proportions resulting in commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and brought about re-oproachment are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as accused in the criminal case. There are many other reasons which need not be mentioned here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and it that process the parties lose their \"young\" days in chasing their \"cases\" in different Courts.\n\n27. Keeping in mind the sage advice of the Apex Court in \nB.S. Joshi Vs. State of Haryana\n 2003 (4) SCC 675 to Courts to encourage settlement of marital disputes between contesting spouses so that they do not lose their youthful years in chasing interminable litigations and reiterating the following lines from paragraph 10 of \nB.S. Joshi Vs. State of Haryana, I\n think the interests of justice would be met if the prayer of parties is acceded to and the criminal proceedings and other litigation between the parties is brought to an end. The lines read:\n\n\"In \nState of Karnataka v. L. Muniswamy and others\n, considering the scope of inherent power of quashing under Section 482, this Court held that in the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is entitled to quash proceedings if it comes to the conclusion that ends of justice so require. It was observed that in a criminal case, the veiled object behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on which the structure of the prosecution rests and the like would justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice and that the ends of justice are higher than the ends of mere law though justice had got to be administered according to laws made by the legislature. This Court said that the compelling necessity for making these observations is that without a proper realization of the object and purpose of the provision which seeks to save the inherent powers of the High Court to do justice between the State and its subjects, it would be impossible to appreciate the width and contours of that salient jurisdiction. On facts, it was also noticed that there was no reasonable likelihood of the accused being convicted of the offence. What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered at her instance due to temperamental differences and implied imputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non-compoundable offences. Answer clearly has to be in 'negative'. It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.\"\n\n28. \nIn \nB.S. Joshi\n's case it has also been observed in paragraph 8, that in an appropriate case for securing the ends of justice, the proceedings can be quashed by the High Court in exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C or even in exercise of its extraordinary powers under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India and in paragraph no.14 it has further observed that there is no doubt that the object of introducing Chapter XX-A containing Section 498A in the \nIndian Penal Code\n was to prevent the torture to a woman by her husband or by relatives of her husband. Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be counter productive and would act against interests of women and against the object for which this provision was added. There is every likelihood that non-exercise of inherent power to quash the proceedings to meet the ends of justice would prevent women from setting earlier. That is not the object of Chapter XXA of \nIndian Penal Code\n.\n\n29. The Apex Court in another decision in case of \nSmt Swati Verma v. Rajan Verma and others\n AIR 2004 SC 261, where similar to the present case, the dispute including the criminal and divorce litigation between the sparring spouses had been decided on the basis of a compromise and where again the husband had paid Rs. 6 lakhs to his wife for the settlement, the apex Court had quashed the criminal proceedings under \nSection 498A\n and \n406\n IPC before the CJM, rendering the application under \nsection 482\n Cr.P.C before the Allahabad High Court infructuous. It had also granted the decree of divorce, rendering the divorce suit pending before the ADJ at Delhi infructuous, In that case in paragraph 7 the Hon'ble Supreme Court had observed:\n\n\"7. Having perused the records placed before us we are satisfied that the marriage between the parties has broken down irretrievably and with a view to restore good relationship and to put a quietus to all litigations between the parties and not to leave any room for future litigation, so that they may live peacefully hereafter, and on the request of the parties, in exercise of the power vested in this Court under \nArticle 142\n of the Constitution of India, we allow the application for divorce by mutual consent filed before us under \nSection 13B\n of Hindu Marriage Act and declare that the marriage solemnized between the consenting parties on 13th June, 2001 at Delhi is hereby dissolved, and they are granted a decree of divorce by mutual consent.\"\n\n30. Since, on behalf of the applicants, the applications have not been pressed on merit, therefore, the detail of each case on merit is not required to be mentioned. Considering the well settled law \nlaid down by\n the Apex Court as discussed above and settlement dated 03.07.2013 between the parties, all the aforesaid cases are liable to be allowed in terms of compromise between the parties concerned and criminal proceeding against the applicants, which are under challenge in all the above criminal misc. applications are liable to be quashed.\n\nConclusion\n \n\n31. In view of above, the following orders are passed:-\n\n(\ni) Proceeding of Complaint\n Case No. 785 of 2010 (Smt. Deepmala Dwivedi Vs.

Marriage is a sacred ceremony, the main purpose of which is to enable the young couple to settle down in life and live peacefully. But little matrimonial skirmishes suddenly extent which often assume serious proportions resulting in commission of heinous crimes in which elders of the family are also involved with the result that those who could have counselled and brought about re-oproachment are rendered helpless on their being arrayed as accused in the criminal case. There are many other reasons which need not be mentioned here for not encouraging matrimonial litigation so that the parties may ponder over their defaults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a Court of law where it takes years and years to conclude and it that process the parties lose their \"young\" days in chasing their \"cases\" in different Courts."

Muniswamy and others\n, considering the scope of inherent power of quashing under Section 482, this Court held that in the exercise of this wholesome power, the High Court is entitled to quash proceedings if it comes to the conclusion that ends of justice so require. It was observed that in a criminal case, the veiled object behind a lame prosecution, the very nature of the material on which the structure of the prosecution rests and the like would justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice and that the ends of justice are higher than the ends of mere law though justice had got to be administered according to laws made by the legislature. This Court said that the compelling necessity for making these observations is that without a proper realization of the object and purpose of the provision which seeks to save the inherent powers of the High Court to do justice between the State and its subjects, it would be impossible to appreciate the width and contours of that salient jurisdiction. On facts, it was also noticed that there was no reasonable likelihood of the accused being convicted of the offence. What would happen to the trial of the case where the wife does not support the imputations made in the FIR of the type in question. As earlier noticed, now she has filed an affidavit that the FIR was registered at her instance due to temperamental differences and implied imputations. There may be many reasons for not supporting the imputations. It may be either for the reason that she has resolved disputes with her husband and his other family members and as a result thereof she has again started living with her husband with whom she earlier had differences or she has willingly parted company and is living happily on her own or has married someone else on earlier marriage having been dissolved by divorce on consent of parties or fails to support the prosecution on some other similar grounds. In such eventuality, there would almost be no chance of conviction. Would it then be proper to decline to exercise power of quashing on the ground that it would be permitting the parties to compound non-compoundable offences. Answer clearly has to be in 'negative'. It would, however, be a different matter if the High Court on facts declines the prayer for quashing for any valid reasons including lack of bona fides.\""

Section 498A was added with a view to punishing a husband and his relatives who harass or torture the wife to coerce her or her relatives to satisfy unlawful demands of dowry. The hyper-technical view would be counter productive and would act against interests of women and against the object for which this provision was added.
