JUSTICE DIVYESH A. JOSHI\n\nDate : 13/01/2025\n\nORAL ORDER\n\n1. The present application, which is a successive\nbail application after the rejection of earlier\nbail application being Criminal Misc. Application\nNo.18701/2023 vide order dated 04.12.2023, is\nfiled under\nSection 439\nof the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973, for regular bail in connection\nwith the FIR being C.R.

Heard learned advocate, Mr. S.D. Mansuri for the\napplicant and learned APP Mr. Soaham Joshi for the\nrespondent - State of Gujarat.\n\n3. Learned advocate for the applicant submitted that\nthe so-called incident has occurred in the evening\n\nPage 1 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nR/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nof 30.11.2022, for which, FIR has been lodged on\nthe very same day i.e. on 30.11.2022 and in\nconnection with the same, the applicant has been\narrested on 11.01.2023 and since then, he is in\njudicial custody. Learned advocate submitted that\nthe applicant is not named in the FIR and only on\nthe basis of the statement of the co-accused, the\napplicant is arraigned as accused. Learned\nadvocate submitted that the applicant was not\nfound in conscious possession of the prohibited\ncontraband articles and there is no recovery or\ndiscovery at the instance of the present applicant\n\n- accused.\n\n4. Learned advocate, at this stage, submitted that\nthis is a successive bail application preferred by\nthe application after the rejection of earlier\nbail application being Criminal Misc. Application\nNo.18701/2023 vide order dated 04.12.2023, however\nwhile rejecting said application, the aspect of\nnon-compliance of the mandatory provision of\n\nSection 52A\nof the NDPS has not been considered\nand wrongly rejected the said application because\nthe communication in that regard, which had been\nundertaken by the IO for complying with the said\nprovision, is not part and parcel of the\nchargesheet papers. It is, therefore, submitted\nthat only on that count, the bail application of\nthe applicant may be considered and the applicant\nmay be granted bail. Learned advocate further\nsubmitted that the applicant is in jail since\n\nPage 2 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nR/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n11.01.2023 and thus, more than 12 months are over\nand, therefore, the applicant may not be kept\nbehind the bar for indefinite period. He further\nsubmitted that even in recent past, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court has also issued guidelines in case\nof delay in trial and the fact that \"bail is a\nrule\" and \"jail is an exception\". It is,\ntherefore, urged that the present application may\nbe allowed.\n\n5. On the other hand, learned APP, Mr. Joshi for the\nrespondent-State has opposed grant of regular bail\nlooking to the nature and gravity of the offence.\nHe submitted that in fact, at the time of hearing\nof earlier bail application, all the aspects\nraised by learned advocate for the applicant have\nbeen considered and as stated above, this is a\nsuccessive bail application preferred by the\napplicant but there is no changed circumstances\nfor filing such application. He further submitted\nthat in fact, the aspect of non-compliance of the\nprovision of\nSection 52A\nof the NDPS has been\nconsidered by the Coordinate Bench of this Court\nwhile passing an order dated 21.08.2024 in\nCriminal Misc. Application No.19761/2023 in case\nof co-accused and the Coordinate Bench of this\nCourt has rejected the said application\nconsidering the said fact, therefore, reliance\nplaced by learned advocate for the applicant on\nthat aspect cannot be considered at this stage.\n\n6. Learned APP submitted that the present application\n\nPage 3 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nR/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nis a successive bail application after the\nrejection of earlier bail application, however,\nthe present application is preferred without\ndisclosing any changed circumstance except abvoe\nand, hence, this application can be said to be\n'review application' and power of review\napplication is very limited and when there is\ntechnical and/or arithmetical error, review\napplication can be preferred, which can be\nentertained but in the present case, the applicant\nhas failed to show any changed circumstance and\nthe reasons, which are mentioned in the memo of\napplication, were at all available at the earlier\npoint of time when earlier bail application was\nrejected.\n\n7. I have heard the learned advocates appearing on\nbehalf of the respective parties and perused the\npapers of the investigation and considered the\nallegations levelled against the applicant and the\nrole played by the applicant. I have also\nconsidered the reasoning given by the concerned\ncourt while rejecting the bail application and the\naffidavit filed by the IO opposing the said\napplication.\n\n8. It is the settled position of the law that, at\nthis juncture detailed discussion of evidence and\ncanvassing of the allegations contained in FIR as\nwell as affidavit of the concerned Investigating\nOfficer or the merits of the case as well, is not\nnecessary and should be avoided.\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nR/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\n9. It is a well settled principle of law that when\nthe successive application comes before the Court,\nthe Court would be very conscious while\nconsidering the same. It is also a settled\nposition of law that successive bail applications\nare permissible under the change circumstances and\nthe change circumstances must be substantial one\nwhich has direct impact on the earlier decision\nand not merely a cosmetic changes which are of\nlittle or no consequences. As held by the Apex\nCourt in\nState of Maharashtra Vs. Captain\nBuddhikota Subha Rao\n, reported in AIR 1989 SC\n2292, that successive bail application can be\nentertained by the Court when substantial change\nis established by the accused, which would entitle\nhim for getting bail in successive bail\napplication. The Court should not pass the order\nof releasing him on bail in successive bail\napplication merely establishing some cosmetic\nchange between time gap of two applications. There\nshould be drastic change during the period between\ntwo applications, which would entitle the accused\nfor bail.\nThe Apex Court in the case of\nKalyanchandra Sarkar Vs. Rajesh Ranjan, reported\nin (2005) 2 SCC 42 while dealing with the issue of\nsuccessive bail application has observed that\nwithout change in the circumstances, the\nsubsequent bail application would be deemed to be\nseeking a review of the earlier rejection order\nwhich is not permissible under the criminal law.\n\nPage 5 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nR/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nThe Apex Court has further observed that while\nentertaining such undefined consequent bail\napplication, the Court has a duty to consider the\nreasons and grounds on which the earlier bail\napplication was rejected and what are the fresh\ngrounds which persuade it warranting the\nevaluation and consideration of the bail\napplication afresh and to take a view different\nfrom one taken in the earlier application.\n\n10. It is found out from the arguments canvassed by\nlearned advocate for the applicant that main\nargument of learned advocate for the applicant is\nwith regard to non-fulfillment of the required\nprocedure as envisaged under\nSection 52A\nof the\nNDPS Act and on the strength of the said argument,\nbail is sought for. It is, however, required to be\nnoted that as can be found from the submissions\ncanvassed by learned APP that in case of co-\naccused, who had filed Criminal Misc. Application\nNo.19761/2023, the Coordinate Bench of this Court,\nafter considering the submissions and considering\nthe said aspect, has rejected the said application\nby detailed order. It is submitted that it is\nspecifically observed in the said order that the\nprocedure under\nSection 52A\nof the NDPS has been\ncarried out by the Investigating Agency belatedly\nbut the said aspect is a matter or proof and would\nrequired consideration at the time of trial. Thus\nthe said view adopted by the Coordinate Bench of\nthis Court can be said to be just, legal and\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\nUploaded by PATIL GAUTAMBHAI GOPALBHAI(HC00190) on Mon Jan 13 2025 Downloaded on : Mon Jan 13 21:50:01 IST 2025\n\nNEUTRAL CITATION\n\nR/CR.MA/25055/2024 ORDER DATED: 13/01/2025\n\nundefined\n\nproper, which in my considered opinion, applies in\nthe facts of the present case. Over and above,\nlearned advocate has failed to point out any\nchanged circumstances. Therefore in absence of any\nchanged circumstances, once again present\napplication is preferred agitating same grounds,\nwhich in the opinion of this Court, is not\navailable to the applicant in a successive bail\napplication.\n\n11. Over and above that, strong apprehension has been\nshown by prosecution that if the applicant is\nreleased on bail then, there is possibility of\ntampering with the evidence and fleeing away from\nthe trial. Therefore considering the nature of\noffence, role attributed to the applicant and\nplayed by him, I am of the opinion that the\npresent application deserves to be rejected.\n\n12. In view of the facts and circumstances of the\npresent case, this Court is of the view that after\nthe rejection of earlier regular bail application,\nthere is no change in the circumstances.\nAccordingly, the present application is rejected.\n\n13. Needless to say that any expression of opinion\ngiven in this order does not mean an expression of\nopinion on the merits of the case and the trial\nCourt will not be influenced by any observations\nmade therein.\n\n(DIVYESH A.
