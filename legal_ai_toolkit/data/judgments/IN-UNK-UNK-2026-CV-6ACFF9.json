Sanjay Bansal, Smt.\nNeeti Mittal, Smt. Preeti Goel and Smt. Radha Agarwal pursued\nthe suit. For the sake of convenience, I shall refer defendant no.2\nby this identification only instead of referring to her LRs, save in\nthe final decision.\n\n2. The aforesaid prayer of seeking possession of and\ninjunction in respect of the suit property became redundant in\nview of defendant no.2 having given up her control over the suit\nproperty and handing over its possession to the plaintiff in the\nproceeding before the High Court of Delhi on 24.02.2020, which\nis recorded in the order dated 13.03.2020 of this Court. Needless\nto say, the suit proceeded further in regard to the remaining\nprayers.\n\n3. Before I set to adjudicate on myriad issues flagged\non either side, let me spell out laconically the landscape of the\npleadings.\n\n4. The case, as initially set up by the plaintiff, was that\nby means of sale deed dated 29.07.1964, registered with Sub-\n\nRegistrar II, New Delhi on 03.08.1964, suit property was sold by\nDLF to Lieutenant Colonel Harjeet Singh (hereinafter, would be\nreferred as 'Colonel'), who became the owner thereof. The suit\nproperty is measuring 266 sq. mts. (318 sq. yards), located in R-\nBlock, facing East and abutting 60 ft. wide road. Colonel\nconstructed a two and quarter story residential house on the suit\n3 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:43:35 +0530\n property which was let out to 'Mr. Pires's Pvt. School' through\nits proprietor Mr. Pires at a monthly rent of Rs.1,800/- w.e.f\n01.10.1971 for three years. On expiry of the three years, the lease\nwas extended and a deed dated 27.09.1974 was executed. The\nextended lease period expired in September, 1977 and as the\nColonel was about to retire, he implored Mr. Pires to vacate the\nsuit property, but in vain.\n\n5. Colonel then filed an eviction petition on the ground\nof bona fide requirement before the Rent Controller, Delhi, the\npetition no. being 965 of 1978, in which Mr. Pires was\nsummoned, who filed an affidavit seeking leave, which was\ngranted to him. In the meanwhile, Mr. Pires died on 19.11.1980\nleaving behind his son Mr. Alan St John Pires and daughter Ms.\nJoyce Pires. The eviction petition remained pending, while the\nColonel also died on 15.01.1982, who was then survived by his\nwidow Smt. Jitender Kaur, his son Sh. Manjit Inder Singh and\nhis daughter Ms. Maninderjit Kaur. By the deed dated\n25.05.1983, daughter Ms. Maninderjit Kaur relinquished her\nright, title and interest in the suit property in favor of her mother\nand brother. The eviction petition was continued by them.\n\n6. By order dated 08.12.1985, the then Additional Rent\nController Sh. A.K. Garg dismissed the eviction petition holding\nthat the purpose of letting being residential cum commercial, the\nground of bona fide requirement was not available. Civil\nRevision No. 214 of 1986 was filed there against, which came to\nbe dismissed in default.\n\n4 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:43:44 +0530\n\n 7. The widow and the son (who were now the owners\nof one-half share each), filed an eviction petition on the ground\nof sub-letting. The Colonel's widow also filed a petition for\neviction under Section 14D. (Both these petitions were later\ndecided against her/successor)\n\n8. The plaint further asserts that in the meanwhile Mr.\nPires abandoned the suit property, the precise date of which is\nnot clear, but in any case it was after 1984. Smt. Seema Bansal,\nthe original defendant no.2, was an employee of Pires's Pvt.\nSchool, who later self-styled herself as Principal and defendant\nno.1 Sh. Surinder K. Bansal was her husband.\n\n9. It is further alleged that before the owners could take\nover the suit property, the defendant no.2 found it convenient to\nunauthorizedly enter in it, which amounted to trespass.\nDefendant no.2, ostensibly, started alleging herself to be the\npartner of Mr. Pires's Pvt. School and, therefore, a tenant in the\nsuit property. To avoid the controversy, the previous owners\nimpleaded defendant no.2 Smt. Seema Bansal as the respondent\nto the eviction petitions with the following description:\n\n \"22.To avoid controversy, the\n previous owners impleaded Seema\n Bansal as a respondent to the eviction\n petitions with the following\n description:-\n\n 2 Mrs. Seema Bansal (S. Bansal)\n alleged partner of Pires's Pvt. School,\n R-96, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi\n (The Petitioners, however, do not\n admit S.Bansal as Partner of Pire's\n Pvt. School, as alleged by her).\"\n\n5 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:43:53 +0530\n\n 10. Defendant no.2, had in the meantime acquired a\nresidential house at M-148, Greater Kailash-II, and shifted there\nalong with her children.\n\n11. The widow of Colonel sold her interest in the suit\nproperty to the plaintiff who purchased the same by means of\nsale deed dated 19.02.1992 and the son of the Colonel also sold\nhis one-half share to the plaintiff. Thus, w.e.f 19.02.1992, the\nplaintiff became the absolute owner of the suit property. When\nthe plaintiff apprised the defendants having become the owner of\nthe suit property, it was replied that when the Colonel and his\nwife could not evict them, the plaintiff should have little hope,\nbut there was an offer to increase the rent from Rs.1,800/- to\nRs.3,498/- per month.\n\n12. The plaintiff, after some investigation, found out\nthat the claim of defendant no.2 being a partner in the school was\nfalse. The plaintiff attempted to reason out with her to get back\nthe possession of the suit property but to no avail. Accordingly,\nthe plaintiff was left with no option, but to bring the present suit.\n\n13. The plaint is contested on behalf of defendant no.2\nwith vehemence. The preliminary objections flagged are that the\nplaint does not disclose any cause of action, is vague and\nmisconceived. The present suit is barred by time and is also bad\nfor mis-joinder of parties. The suit of the plaintiff is based on the\nsale deed dated 19.02.1992, alleged to have been executed by\nSmt. Jitender Kaur, but necessary particulars of its registration in\nthe office of Sub-Registrar have not been disclosed. The plaintiff\n\n6 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:44:02 +0530\n has no locus standi to file the present suit as Smt. Jitender Kaur\nfrom whom the plaintiff has alleged to have purchased the suit\nproperty was not the owner on 19.02.1992 as defendant no.2\nSmt. Seema Bansal became the owner by adverse possession in\nOctober 1989, which in fact started from October 1977, when\nthere was a positive act of ouster on her part and when she got\nthe exclusive possession of the suit property and when she\nasserted hostile title and from that time onwards her possession\nhad been open, continuous, hostile, peaceful and uninterrupted.\n\n14. It is further canvassed that the fact of adverse\npossession of defendant no.2 is also evident from the pleadings\nof the plaintiff where it is alleged that the suit property was\nabandoned by Mr. Pires. The plaintiff has intentionally omitted to\ngive the date of abandonment and the time of actual, physical\nand hostile possession of defendant no.2 started w.e.f October\n1977. It is further alleged that the title of defendant no.2 was\neven perfected against LRs of deceased Colonel and, thus,\nplaintiff cannot be said to have acquired any right, title or interest\nwith respect to the suit property. The school was being run by\ndefendant no.2 in the suit property in her own right, without any\ninterference from anybody. It is also alleged that neither the site\nplan of the suit property nor its boundaries have been given in\nthe plaint so as to identify it.\n\n15. The further combat is to the effect that in the\npetition under \nsection 14 (1) (b)\n of Delhi Rent Control Act [\nDRC\nAct\n] the plaintiff has stated against the ground for eviction that\nwithout any consent in writing of the plaintiff and her\npredecessors, the erstwhile tenant, sub-let, assigned and parted\n\n7 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:44:11 +0530\n with possession to respondent no.2 (Defendant no.2 herein)\nsubsequent to 1974 and had accordingly prayed before the Rent\nController that the eviction order with costs be passed in favor of\nthe petitioner and against the respondent. The said petition was\ndismissed on 17.05.1996, a date well after the filing of plaint,\nwritten statement, replication and framing of issues. This had\nnecessitated filing of amended written statement under \nOrder 6\nRule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908 [\nCPC\n]. The present\nsuit is barred in view of \nSection 50\n of DRC Act, read with other\nprovisions read with averments in the plaint, amended written\nstatement. The judgment dated 17.05.1996 even otherwise\noperates as res-judicata and the present suit cannot be tried.\n\n16. On merits, defendants have substantially dis-\naffirmed the contents of the plaint. It is reiterated that defendant\nno.2 is holding the suit property in adverse possession without\nany interruption since October 1977 onwards. Mr. Maurice\nWilfred Pires died on 19.11.1980 and the Colonel died on\n15.01.1982 and the said Smt. Jitender Kaur, Sh. Manjit Inder\nSingh and Ms. Maninderjit Kaur were the legal heirs of the\nColonel. It is though denied that any right was relinquished vide\ndeed dated 25.05.1983.\n\n17. It is further alleged that the widow and Smt. Jitender\nKaur were not the owners of the suit property and the eviction\npetition was filed on false averments, which eventually came to\nbe dismissed on 17.05.1996. The eviction petition, prior to this,\nunder \nSection 14D\n of DRC Act also came to be dismissed on\n11.02.1994. On this premise, the reliefs sought on behalf of\n8 \nChitra Garg Vs.

The replication was filed on behalf of the plaintiff\nagainst the initial written statement, but no replication was filed\nagainst the amended written statement.\n\n19. Vide order dated 24.04.1995, admission-denial of\nthe documents was conducted. Initially, on behalf of the plaintiff,\nonly one document came to be admitted which was marked as\nEx.D1. Vide order dated 11.03.1997, some of the documents\nfiled on behalf of the plaintiff were admitted which were marked\nas Ex.P1 to Ex.P36. On behalf of the plaintiff, further documents\nof the defendant's side were admitted which were also marked as\nEx.D2 to Ex.D4.\n\n20. Post consummation of the pleadings, on 31.07.1995,\nthe following issues were initially framed:\n\n Issue no.1 : Whether the suit property has been\nproperly valued for purpose of Court Fees?\n Issue no.2 : Whether the suit is barred by time?\n Issue no.3 : Whether the plaintiff is owner of the\nproperty? If not, to what effect?\n Issue no.4 : Whether the defendant no.2 has become\nowner by adverse possession?\n Issue no.5 : Whether plaintiff is entitled to claim mesne\nprofits or damages for use and occupation of the premises by\nthe defendant? If so, at what rate and for what period?\n Issue no.6 : Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover\n\n9 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:44:29 +0530\n possession?\n\n Issue no.7 : Relief.\n\n21. However, vide order dated 13.03.2020, the issues\nwere recast, as the relief towards the possession of the suit\nproperty stood satisfied. Ld. Predecessor of this Court canceled\nthe previous issues and the fresh issues were framed as under:\n\n Issue no.1: Whether the plaintiff is entitled for the\nrelief of mesne profit/damages as claimed? OPP\n Issue no.2: Whether the plaintiff is also entitled to any\ninterest? OPP\n\n22. Thereafter, considering the antiquity of the case, by\nvirtue of Order 18 Rule 4 read with \nOrder 26 Rule 4A CPC\n, Ms.\nStuti Gupta, Advocate was appointed as Local Commissioner to\nrecord the evidence. However, the recording of evidence could\nnot take place before the Local Commissioner and it is on\n27.02.2021 that PW-1 Sh. Sanjay Goel came to be examined\nbefore the Court who tendered his evidence by way of affidavit\nEx.PW-1/A and relied upon the following documents:\n\ni. General Power of Attorney as Ex.PW-1/1.\nii.

Ld. counsel also\nattracted the attention of the court to the history of the case by\nadumbrating upon various time lines and how the case unfolded\nover three decades. Ld. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff also\nriveted the attention of the court to the germane extracts of the\ncross examination of defendant witnesses and argued for the\ngrant of the mesne profits and the compound interest with the\nsupport of various case laws of High Court and Supreme Court.\n\n28. Ld. Senior counsel for the plaintiff highlighted the\nmanner in which the defendant no.2 allegedly abused the process\nof the law for almost thirty years and how the defendant no.2\nheld on to the possession of the suit property on the pretext of a\nfalse, flimsy and frivolous ground of adverse possession. Ld.\nSenior Counsel carved out a distinction between the defence of\ndenial and affirmative false claim which has been put forth by\n\n14 \nChitra Garg Vs.

Ld. Counsel for\nthe plaintiff also adverted to the affidavit of DW1/LR of the\ndefendant to punch holes in the defence sought to be projected on\nbehalf of defendant no.2.\n\n29. In order to embolden the submissions advanced, Ld.\nSenior counsel for the plaintiff also took the court through the\nexcerpts of various judgments to emphasize that where the\nlitigants, on the strength of false pleadings and documents,\nmanage to procrastinate the litigation, the court must apply the\nprinciple of restitution in a pragmatic manner in order to do real\nand substantial justice.\n\n30.

On the aspect of grant of interest (simple-\n\ncompound), Ld. counsel referred to Indian Council for Enviro-\nLegal Action Vs. Union of India, JT 2011 (8) SC 375. The\nrelevant para no.169, 178, 179 and 180 are mentioned below:\n\n \"169. Unjust enrichment has been\n defined as: \"A benefit obtained\n from another, not intended as a gift\n and not legally justifiable, for\n which the beneficiary must make\n restitution or recompense.\" See\n Black's Law Dictionary, Eighth\n Edition (Bryan A. Garner) at page\n 1573.\n\n ....\n\n 178. While Section (') 3 (Unjust\n Enrichment) reads as under:\n\n \n\"The phrase \"unjust enrichment\" is\n used in law to characterize the\n result or effect of a failure to make\n\n16 \nChitra Garg Vs.

It is a general\n principle, underlying various legal\n doctrines and remedies, that one\n person should not be permitted\n unjustly to enrich himself at the\n expense of another, but should be\n required to make restitution of or\n for property or benefits received,\n retained, or appropriated, where it\n is just and equitable that such\n restitution be made, and where\n such action involves no violation\n or frustration of law or opposition\n to public policy, either directly or\n indirectly.\"\n\n 179. Unjust enrichment is basic to\n the subject of restitution, and is\n indeed approached as a\n fundamental principle thereof.\n\n They are usually linked together,\n and restitution is frequently based\n upon the theory of unjust\n enrichment. However, although\n unjust enrichment is often referred\n to or regarded as a ground for\n restitution, it is perhaps more\n accurate to regard it as a\n prerequisite, for usually there can\n be no restitution without unjust\n enrichment. It is defined as the\n unjust retention of a benefit to the\n loss of another or the retention of\n money or property of another\n against the fundamental principles\n of justice or equity and good\n conscience. A person is enriched if\n he has received a benefit, and he is\n unjustly enriched if retention of the\n benefit would be unjust. Unjust\n enrichment of a person occurs\n when he has and retains money or\n benefits which in justice and\n equity belong to another.\n\n \n180. While the term `restitution'\n was considered by the Supreme\n Court in \nSouth-Eastern Coalfields\n\n17 Chitra Garg Vs.

Ld. Senior Counsel for plaintiff, to further\nemphasize on the aspect of measure of damages in case of illegal\ntrespass, alluded to the judgment of High Court of Madras in \nK\nPandurangan Vs. Mrs. C Parimala\n, date of decision\n23.12.2021. Ld. Senior Counsel for plaintiff devoted sufficient\ntime to take the court through this judgment to hammer home the\npoint that a trespasser's liability should be one of reparation of\nwhich restitution is a part.\n\n35. In so far as arguments on behalf of defendant no.2\nare concerned, Ld. Counsel Sh. Pawan Mathur also advanced\nmarathon and comprehensive arguments, which I shall advert to\nin the discussion indicated infra. In the written submissions on\nbehalf of defendant no.2 also, it is noticed that some of the\narguments were duplicative, beyond pleadings and not relevant\nto the facts in issue. Therefore, I deem it prudent to only allude to\nrelevant arguments.\n\n36. At the outset, I decide the objections raised on\nbehalf of defendant no.2 at the time of tendering of evidence by\nPW1. With regard to general power of attorney Ex.PW1/1,\nphotographs Ex.PW1/2 (colly) and Ex.PW1/3 (colly), no\nobjection was raised. With regard to google satellite image\nEx.PW1/4, an objection was raised that it is not accompanied by\n\n18 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:45:46 +0530\n certificate under \nSection 65B\n of Indian Evidence Act, which\nobjection is found to be valid and is accepted as this document\nappears to be a computer generated and the certificate is\nmandatory. With regard to the four visiting cards Mark PW1/5\n(colly) also, an objection was raised on the ground that PW1 is\nnot the author/witness to the same nor the same was part of the\npleading or record. This objection is also valid and these visiting\ncards cannot be read in evidence. A letter dated 08.09.2016 Mark\nPW1/6 also was objected to on the same ground, which objection\nis also found to be valid and this document also cannot be read in\nevidence. With regard to valuation report dated 28.03.1996\nEx.PW1/7 of Sh. T S Ratnam also, an objection was raised,\nhowever, this objection is rejected as pointed out by Ld. counsel\nfor plaintiff that the said valuation report was filed by defendant\nhimself. With regard to 54 certified lease deeds also, an objection\nwas raised but which objection was removed by examining PW2\nand exhibiting the lease deeds through the registrar office.\n\n37. Before I get poised to render finding on the two\nissues framed vide order dated 13.03.2020 as already noted in the\npreceding discussion, I would like to throw a succinct outline\nagain, following which, I shall deal with the plethora of the\narguments, factual and legal advanced on behalf of both the sides\nand alongside that I shall also dwell upon the evidence led by\nboth the sides and various case laws on the aspect of mesne\nprofits.\n\n38. The present suit was initially instituted on behalf of\nthe plaintiff against defendant no.1 and 2 for seeking possession\n\n19 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:45:54 +0530\n of the suit property, recovery of damages/mesne profits for the\nperiod from 09.02.1992 onwards, among other reliefs. During the\ncourse of the proceedings, defendants contested the suit tooth and\nnail. In the meanwhile, defendant no.1 claimed to be unrelated to\nthe suit property and sought to be subtracted from the array of\nparties, and eventually he was dropped. Defendant no.2, wife of\nthe defendant no.1, proceeded with her contest, who claimed to\nhave become the owner of the suit property by way of adverse\npossession in October 1989, her adverse possession having\nstarted with effect from October 1977. Statement of defendant\nno.2 was also recorded under \nOrder 10 CPC\n on 15.05.1995\nwherein also she postulated to be partners with Sh. Pires in the\nschool which was a tenant in the suit property and that later she\nbought the school from Sh. Pires and after his death, she became\nthe owner of the school as well as the suit property. She further\nclaimed having been depositing the rent of the suit property in\nthe court and stated that though her possession of the suit\nproperty was that of a tenant, but she became the owner being in\noccupation of the suit property for more than 12 years. She was\npertinent to clarify that her claim was only on adverse\npossession.\n\n39. During the course of further proceedings, defendant\nno.2 sought to amend her aforesaid suit but her attempts were\nscotched, particularly vide order dated 10.01.2018 whereby her\napplication under \nOrder 6 Rule 17 CPC\n came to be dismissed\nwith the cost of Rs.30,000/-. It can be culled out from the\nparagraph 4 of the said order that by way of the said application,\ndefendant sought to make the following amends:\n\n Digitally signed\n\n20 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:46:02 +0530\n \"4. By way of present application,\n following amendments are sought in\n WS:-\n\n \"(a) The defendant as an employee of\n Mr. Pires' Pvt School was authorized\n to occupy the suit premises. The suit\n premises has always been and\n continues to be in possession of Mr.\n Pires' Pvt School being run by the\n defendant and hence the Defendant\n cannot be regarded as trespasser.\n\n (b) The Defendant is in occupation as\n co-tenant.\n\n (c) In view of previous proceedings\n before the Rent Controller instituted\n by the plaintiff's predecessor in\n interest, the plaintiff is estopped from\n alleging that the Defendant is a\n trespasser. The plaintiff cannot\n approbate and reprobate.\n\n (d) In view of the fact that the\n defendant was granted leave to defend\n u/s 25B(4) in the proceedings\n u/s\n 14(1)(e)\n, \n14(1)(b)\n and \n14(D)\n of the\n DRC Act, which was not challenged\n by the plaintiff's predecessor on the\n ground that the defendant was a\n trespasser and the said order having\n attained finality\n u/s 43\n of the DRC\n Act, consequently, the existence of\n landlord-tenant relationship between\n the parties stands established.\n\n (e) In view of the fact that the\n plaintiff's predecessor obtained orders\n u/s 15(2) of the \nDRC Act\n for deposit\n of rent; pursuant thereto the defendant\n deposited the rent and the plaintiff's\n predecessor withdrew the rent,\n therefore, the same conclusively\n establishes landlord-tenant\n relationship between the parties.\n\n (f) Even before the Supreme Court,\n the plaintiff admitted that the\n defendant is assignee and the term\n lessee in the lease agreement dated\n 27.09.1974 has been defined to\n include assignee.\n\n (g) In view of the fact that the tenancy\n was determined in October 1977 and\n\n21 Chitra Garg Vs.

Post the dismissal of the aforesaid application,\ndefendant no. 2 challenged the said order before High Court of\nDelhi and during the course of the proceedings therein, on\n24.02.2020, defendant no.2 agreed to give up the possession of\nthe suit property and handed over the keys to the plaintiff. The\nHon'ble Judge of the High Court of Delhi then disposed of the\nchallenge and relegated the parties to the trial court for inquiry\ninto the claim of mesne profits.\n\n41. Issue no.1: Whether the plaintiff is entitled for\nthe relief of mesne profit/damages as claimed? OPP\n\ni. The burden to prove this issue was upon plaintiff. I\nwould broach this issue with the most crucial argument raised on\nbehalf of plaintiff that in the aforesaid background the plaintiff is\nalready found entitled to mesne profits in the light of the\ndefendant no.2 having given up the possession of the suit\nproperty after holding on to it for many years and now only\nquantum of mesne profits is to be decided or as contended by Ld.\n\n22 Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n BUDHIRAJA\n\n NAVJEET\n\n Date:\n\n BUDHIRAJA 2023.10.09\n 15:46:18\n +0530\n Counsel for defendant no.2, the plaintiff has to first establish her\nright and entitlement to claim the mesne profits and only then the\ncourt can enter into the realm of quantifying the same. During\nthe course of in-extenso and comprehensive final arguments\nspilling over to months, Ld. Counsel for defendant Sh. Pawan\nMathur was confronted with a query as to in what capacity\ndefendant no.2 held on to the possession of the suit property for\nalmost three decades after the institution of the suit and what\nmade her to finally give up the possession before High Court of\nDelhi, to which, Ld. Counsel for would adopt a circuitous route\nand eschewed coming up with a clean and clear response.\nThough, he kept on harping that defendant no.2 being a partner\nof Pires School was occupying the suit property in the capacity\nof the tenant and just because she had given up the possession of\nthe suit property, it would not tantamount to the entitlement of\nthe plaintiff to claim mesne profits in respect of the suit property,\nbut, I respectfully differ on this count, as this argument is nothing\nbut a ruse to scupper the entitlement of the plaintiff to claim\nmesne profits for the entire length of the period for which the\ndefendant no.2 held on to the suit property. But before I build\nupon this view, some of the road blocks have to be cleared which\nhave been placed on behalf of defendant no.2 in the form of legal\narguments.\n\nii. The first legal submission on behalf of defendant no.\n2, as extracted from the written submission, is as under:\n\n \"The tenant in the property\n who is a necessary and\n property party to the suit\n has not been impleaded and\n the suit is liable to be\n dismissed under Order I\n Rule 9 of the Code of Civil\n\n23 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n BUDHIRAJA\n\n NAVJEET\n\n Date:\n\n BUDHIRAJA 2023.10.09\n 15:46:36\n +0530\n Procedure. It is all the more\n necessary in view of the\n fact that the plaintiff is\n pursuing eviction of the\n tenant under \nsection 14(1)\n\n (b) of the DRC Act, 14(1)\n\n (c) of the \nDRC Act\n and (c)\n of the \nDRC Act\n and even\n the plaintiff has prosecuted\n the litigation for the\n eviction of the tenant\n before the \nDRC Act\n\"\n\niii. In furtherance of the aforementioned first legal\nsubmission, Ld. Counsel for defendant ambitiously assailed the\ncase of the plaintiff and her pleading in the instant suit on the\nback of the previous pleading on behalf of the plaintiff and her\npredecessor which were in relation to the eviction of the tenant\nby way of various petitions under \nDRC Act\n. Ld. Counsel for\ndefendant argued that when the suit property was purchased by\nthe plaintiff, admittedly there was litigation pending in various\ncourts against the tenant Pires Private School, a partnership\nconcern and defendant no.2, and which fact is also evident from\nthe contents of sale deed executed in favour of the plaintiff.\nThus, the said tenant Pires Private Limited, a partnership concern\nis the necessary and property party to the suit, and it has been\ndeliberately not impleaded by the plaintiff by the plaintiff with\nmala-fide intention and to mislead the court. It is further the\nargument that the trespass on the suit property by an alleged third\nperson after the alleged abandonment by the tenant cannot be\npleaded and proved without the tenant being impleaded as a\nparty to the suit and no order for possession of the suit property\ncan be sought.\n\n24 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:46:45 +0530\n iv. Ld. counsel for defendant further argued with\nvehemence that it is an admitted case of the plaintiff as borne out\nfrom various admitted documents that the tenant i.e. partnership\nconcern, Mr. Pires Private School was running the school in\nwhich defendant no.2 was the principal and one of the partners.\nIn the previous litigations by erstwhile owner/landlord Colonel\nand Smt. Jitender Kaur (wife), his son Sh. Manjit Inder Singh\nand his daughter Ms. Maninderjit Kaur, an eviction petition\nunder \nSection 14(1)(b)\n of DRC Act was filed which after the\npurchase of the suit property was continued by the plaintiff\nherein wherein the categorical stand was that defendant no.2 was\na tenant in the suit property. It is further argued that even when\nthe plaintiff was pursuing this stand before the Ld. Rent\nController that the tenant of the suit property was a partnership\nconcern and that defendant no.2 was sublet the suit property,\nplaintiff on 10.11.93 filed this present suit on the false and\nincorrect premise of the tenant being one individual Mr. Pires\nand defendant no.2 being the trespasser, after the suit property\nwas abandoned by Mr. Pires. Though it is a specific and admitted\ncase of the plaintiff in paragraph 19 that defendant no.2 was an\nemployee of the school and was a teacher cum manager who\nlater called herself the Principal but still her status was shown\nand pleaded to be that of trespasser.\n\nv. Ld. Counsel for defendant thereafter took the court\nthrough the proceedings of the previous litigation under the \nDRC\nAct\n i.e. eviction petition under \nSection 14(1)(e)\n of DRC Act\ninstituted by Colonel against Mr. Pires Public School which was\ndismissed vide order dated 03.12.1985 Ex.P1, the eviction\n\n25 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:46:53 +0530\n petition filed his LRs under \nSection 14(1)(b)\n of DRC Act, and\neviction petition under \nSection 14(1)(D)\n of DRC Act, also filed\nby LRs of Colonel. Ld. Counsel for defendant further argued that\nplaintiff is to be held liable for concealment of all these facts and\nfor projecting the false case against the defendant no.2 of she\nbeing the trespasser into the suit property. Ld. Counsel further\nhighlighted that an application under \nOrder 22 Rule 10 CPC\n was\nalso filed by the plaintiff in the eviction petition under \nSection\n14(1)(b)\n of the DRC Act with the sole intention of the preventing\nthis court from examining the document which could show that\nthe case of the plaintiff against defendant No.2 before the Ld.\nRent Controller was that the possession of the suit property was\nhanded over to defendant no.2 by the tenant and she was not a\ntrespasser under any circumstances. The said eviction petition\ncame to be dismissed by the rent court vide order dated\n17.05.1996 Ex.D5. On this bedrock, Ld. Counsel further argued\nthat it is the plaintiff who is guilty of approbating and\nreprobating rather than defendant no.2. In support of his\narguments, Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 has referred to the\nfollowing judgments:\n\nA. Shyam Telelink Limited Vs. Union of India\n, (2010) 10 SCC\n\n165\n\nB. Bharti Cellular Limited Vs. Union of India and Ors,\n(2010) 10 SCC 174\n\nvi. It is further the stand of the defendant no.2 that in\nlight of the decision in the eviction petition under \nSection 14(1)\n\n(b) of \nDRC Act\n, defendant filed for the amendment of the written\nstatement, which was not opposed by the plaintiff and the\n\n26 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:47:02 +0530\n amendment was allowed vide order dated 03.12.1996, but the\nplaintiff deliberately did not file any replication thereto. The\nreplication dated 07.11.1994 in response to the original written\nstatement dated 16.08.1994 only goes on to show and\ndemonstrate that the suit filed by the plaintiff is false.\n\nvii. This contention, at the first blush, certainly appears\nto be meritorious as it is an admitted position which is culled out\nfrom various petitions under the \nDRC Act\n, the record of which\nhas been filed in the present suit, however, Ld. Counsel for\ndefendant no.2 in his arguments has completely side lined and\nabandoned the defence of the defendant no.2 having become\nowner of the suit property by way of adverse possession,\nprobably for the reason that during the course of the proceeding,\ndefendant no.2 sought to divorce herself from this defence and\nrather substitute the same by way of her being in occupation of\nthe suit property as a tenant. But as has already been noted, those\nattempts of defendant no.2 were unsuccessful and she was not\npermitted to make any amends.\n\nviii. The aforesaid legal submissions have also been\nstrongly opposed on behalf of the plaintiff, and rightly so, as on\nthe date when the plaintiff purchased the suit property by way of\nregistered sale deed the defendants herein were in occupation of\nthe suit property and in the written statement, defendants\nnowhere flagged any such objection as to non-impleadment of\nPires Private School, probably for the reason that defendant no.2\nprojected herself to be the owner of the suit property by way of\nadverse possession. \nIn paragraph 5 of the written statement, she\n27 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:47:11 +0530\n went on to challenge the locus of the plaintiff to file the present\nsuit on the back of assertions that Smt. Jitender Kaur from whom\nthe plaintiff alleged to have purchased the suit property was not\nthe owner on 19.02.1992 as defendant no.2 had become the\nowner by way of adverse possession. She also pleaded that there\nwas a positive act of ouster on her part and when she asserted\nhostile title and from that time onwards her possession had been\nopen, continuous, hostile, peaceful and uninterrupted and she\nperfected her title over the suit property by way of adverse\npossession even before the execution of the sale deed in favour\nof the plaintiff. It is also noticed that at other stages of written\nstatement also, defendant no.2 tenaciously persisted with the\nclaim of her ownership over the suit property by way of adverse\npossession. But there is nothing in the entire written statement\nthat the defendants were in occupation of the suit property in the\ncapacity of being a partner in Pires School and eventually as a\ntenant. There is no pleading on the part of the defendant no.2 as\nto in what capacity, she came to occupy the suit property. Rather,\nin the written statement, she claimed that the school was being\nrun by her in her own right. Further, all these claims came to\nnaught and drew blank when the possession of the suit property\nwas handed over to the plaintiff, which act clearly debunks and\nbelies the version of defendant no.2 having gained ownership\nover the suit property on the basis of adverse possession. Thus,\nLd. Counsel for defendant no.2, in my opinion, had no basis to\nargue on this line and prolong the litigation.\n\nix. Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 had also laid his\nthrust upon the partnership theory by further relying upon the\n28 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:47:21 +0530\n partnership deed Ex.D2 dated 07.01.1978 to assert that defendant\nno.2 was in fact a partner with Sh. Pires in the Pires School.\nHowever, this would also not advance the cause of defendant\nno.2 as already noted that without any pleading in this regard,\nthis partnership deed cannot be said to be taken to be a\nsupplement to the said averment. DW1 in his extensive cross\nexamination also harped on his alleged plea of partnership of\ndefendant no.2 with Sh. Pires. Though DW1 claimed that\ndefendant no.2 entered into partnership with Sh. Pires in the year\n1974, however, there is no evidence in regard to the inception of\nthe alleged partnership in the year 1974. Otherwise also as\nalready stated, since this statement was beyond pleading, the\ntestimony of DW1 on this score is hardly relevant.\n\nx. Though, Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 sought to\nfind fault with the pleading of the plaintiff in the sense that the\npleading is bereft of the details as to when Mr. Pires abandoned\nthe suit property and defendant no.2 trespassed the same, and I\nalso agree with this to the extent that plaintiff ought to have come\nclean on the details of the abandonment of the suit property and\nwrongful entry of defendant no.2 in the same, but in view of the\naforesaid frivolous and vexatious claim of defendant no.2\nhaving not yielded any result in her favour, the said omissions in\nthe plaint cannot be said to be fatal.\n\nxi. In so far as the previous petitions under the \nDRC\nAct\n on behalf of the plaintiff are concerned, though, there is no\ndenial that at some point of time, the predecessor in interest of\nthe plaintiff was pursuing litigation against Pires Private School\n29 Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:47:30 +0530\n seeking its eviction which proceeding was taken over and\npursued by the plaintiff and which did not see fruition, however,\none of those petitions of \nDRC Act\n was contested by the\ndefendant on the ground of pendency of the present suit, which\nfact was taken cognizance of by the Hon'ble Judge of the High\nCourt of Delhi in this case vide order dated 09.09.2009 wherein\nit opined that the said conduct of defendant no.2 appears to be\nmala fide and she cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate\nat the same time and cannot oust the plaintiff from the\nproceeding for eviction of defendant no.2. Therefore, continuing\nwith the said view, I am also of the opinion that this court has to\nconfine itself to the pleadings of the present suit without\nembarking upon any inquiry as to the previous petitions between\nthe parties which may have been filed under the \nDRC Act\n. What\nis to be seen herein is that the defendant no.2 has taken an\nunequivocal stand having been in possession of the suit property\non the basis of the ownership having accrued to her by way of\nadverse possession and since defendant no.2 has given up the\npossession of the suit property in a related proceeding before the\nHigh Court of Delhi, it is obvious that the stand of the defendant\nno.2 was specious, untruthful, and was nothing but a facade to\nheld on to and retain the illegal possession of the suit property,\nthereby denuding the plaintiff of her right to enjoy the suit\nproperty.\n\nxii. Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 also argued on the\nlines that the annexures filed along with the pleadings constitute\nthe part of the pleadings, and therefore, even if in the written\nstatement of defendant no.2, there is no pleading qua her\n\n30 \nChitra Garg Vs.

To\nassert the point that the annexures to the plaint are part of the\npleadings, reliance is placed on behalf of the defendant no.2 on\nthe following pronouncements:\n\nA. K K Manchanda Vs. S D Technical Services Pvt Ltd,\nReview\n application no. 320/2008, CM (Main) No. 1205/2017,\ndated 01.07.2009\n\nB. Modern India Builders Vs.

Girija Surendran, AIR 2002\nKerala 62\n\nxiii. The aforesaid argument, in the context of the factual\nposition of the present suit, cannot help the case of the defendant\nno.2 as the annexures cannot substitute and take the place of\npleadings. The annexures filed along with the pleadings must\nsupplement the pleadings rather than run contrary to it. As noted\n\n31 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:47:47 +0530\n above, the written statement on behalf of defendant no.2 does not\ncontain any pleading as to her occupation of the suit property as\ntenant and also that there is no such pleading of the present suit\nbeing bad for non-impleadment of a proper or necessary party,\ntherefore, I do not find any merit in the aforesaid legal\nsubmission. The Judgments referred are clearly on distinct\nsetting and are of no help.\n\nxiv. In this backdrop, I also feel the urge to examine\nwhether a person can take an alternative plea of adverse\npossession and tenancy. The High Court of Delhi had an\nopportunity to deal with somewhat similar situation in Hansraj\nVs. Raghubir Singh and others, RFA No. 633/2014, decided\non 09.01.2020. The issue therein in brief was that the\nrespondents were admitted to be the owners of the suit property\nand the appellant/tenants used to pay rental. The appellant later\nsought to claim his ownership by way of adverse possession and\nchallenged the order of Trial Court under \nOrder 12 Rule 6 CPC\n\nbefore the High Court of Delhi on the pretext that the civil court\ndid not have the jurisdiction as the suit was barred by \nDRC Act\n.\nThe Court therein held that though it is a settled law that the\n\nDRC Act\n proceeds on an assumption that there exists a\nrelationship of landlord/tenant between the parties and in case of\nmere denial of such, rent tribunal is an authority to determine the\nsuch question. But it was further held that there is no cavil with\nsaid proposition of law but that does not mean that the person\nclaiming to be a landlord cannot proceed by filing a civil suit by\nrelying upon the pleading of the tenant before the competent\nauthority. \nOnce the appellant claims to be in adverse possession\n32 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:47:56 +0530\n of the premise, he cannot allege himself to be a tenant as both\nthese pleas cannot exist together. The principle that once a tenant\nalways a tenant ends on taking plea of adverse possession and\nascertaining one's owner right.\n\nxv. In the instant case also, we are somewhat confronted\nwith a situation where on one hand predecessor in interest of the\nplaintiff and thereafter the plaintiff pursued the proceeding under\n\nSection 14\n of DRC Act wherein defendant no.2 was also\nimpleaded as an alleged tenant, and on the other hand, plaintiff\nhas filed the present suit on the bedrock of the defendant no.2\nhaving been in unlawful possession of the suit property being a\ntrespasser. We have already noted that the Hon'ble Judge of the\nHigh Court of Delhi, when the suit was being dealt with therein,\nhad held in order dated September 9, 2009 that the plaintiff\ncannot be ousted from the jurisdiction of this court in view of the\ndivergent stand of the defendant no.2. Now since the case is\nabout to achieve finality, this issue has to be dealt with in\naccordance with the legal principle of law. In my view, once the\nplaintiff has taken the stand before Ld. Rent Controller in various\npetitions under \nSection 14\n of DRC Act that defendant no.2 was a\ntenant in the suit property (though plaintiff sought to justify that\nshe was impleaded as alleged to be a tenant), those proceedings\nought to have been taken to its logical conclusion in Appellate\nCourt even if the reliefs claimed therein eluded the plaintiff\nbefore the Rent Tribunal, but eventually plaintiff chose to pursue\nthe present suit, and therefore, now this situation has to be\nreconciled on the basis of the respective pleadings of both the\nparties. As we have noted in the aforesaid case law of High Court\n\n Digitally signed\n\n33 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:48:04 +0530\n of Delhi that the plea of adverse possession is mutually\ndestructive vis a vis the plea of tenancy under the \nDRC Act\n and\non this premise the court had upheld the order of eviction passed\nin the civil suit, but in this case, the plaintiff has not complied\nwith the formalities as envisaged in the Transfer of Properties\nAct for forfeiture of the lease, for the reason that the plaintiff in\nthe present suit has not acknowledged the capacity of the\ndefendant no.2 being in possession of the suit property as a\ntenant. Be that as it may, since defendant no.2 has failed to stick\nto her guns of staking her claim over the suit property on the\nbasis of adverse possession after having given up the physical\npossession thereto in favour of the plaintiff, defendant no.2\ncannot be accorded the benefit of this flaw in the suit of the\nplaintiff. Plaintiff cannot be left in lurch after having fought this\nlitigation for almost three decades due to the illegal act of\ndefendant no.2 in continuing in the suit property despite knowing\nthe legal right of the plaintiff over the suit property.\n\nxvi. Now before I part with this issue, if I, for once,\nassume that defendant no.2 was once a partner with Pires School\nof Pires who was a tenant as alleged and later she occupied the\nsuit property as tenant and that she cannot be termed as a\ntrespasser, there arise some lingering questions in my mind and\nwhether defendant no.2 has any valid explanations to those. First\nis, after the death of Pires, legally did the partnership survive\nbetween him and defendant no. 2? Second, did defendant no.2\nattempt to forge partnership with legal heirs of Pires to take the\nalleged partnership forward? Third, did defendant no.2 attempt to\nrent the suit property from colonel or his representatives after the\n\n34 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:48:12 +0530\n death of Pires? The answer to all these questions is \"No\". And\nwhy she did not tread on any of the aforesaid path, because she\nwas driven by the greed and avarice to take over the entire school\nfirst and eventually the suit property, and it is this wanton greed\nwhich made her audacious enough to even challenge the\nownership of Colonel family, the erstwhile owner and later the\nplaintiff's title for more than 25 years. In this view of the matter,\nI fail to fathom as to on what grounds defendant no.2 claim to be\nexonerated from the liability to compensate the plaintiff.\n\nxvii. The second legal submission on behalf of defendant\nis that the power of attorney was not filed on behalf of the\nplaintiff with the leave of the court. It was argued that PW1 Sh.\nSanjay Goel could not have appeared on behalf of the plaintiff in\nthe present suit and the alleged attorney dated 02.02.2021\nEx.PW1/1 was not filed by this witness with the\nleave/permission of the court. It was argued that the plaintiff had\nto file all the documents before the court at the time of filing of\nthe suit or replication, which was not done and thus, this power\nof attorney along with the evidence by way of affidavit of PW1\ncannot be read in evidence.\n\nxviii. The third legal submission is also in regard to power\nof attorney only and which is that the same has not been proved\nin accordance with law. It is argued that the original of the said\npower of attorney has not been filed in the court record and the\nphotocopy Ex.PW1/1 cannot be said to have been proved in\naccordance with law. Further, it is argued that since the plaintiff's\nwitness has not identified and proved the signatures of the\n\n35 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:48:20 +0530\n plaintiff on the document as required under the provision of 67 of\n\nIndian Evidence Act\n 1872, the said special power of attorney\ncannot be said to be proved. It is further argued that the executant\nof the said attorney has not entered into the witness box nor any\nattesting witness has been examined as per \nSection 68\n of Indian\nEvidence Act 1872.\n\nxix. The fourth legal submission is that the said power of\nattorney has not been proved as per the \nNotaries Act\n 1956 and\nthe Notaries Rules 1956. The arguments in this regard, as culled\nout from the written submission on behalf of the defendant, are\nas under:\n\n \"\nSection 8\n of the Notaries Act, 1952\n provides the Functions of a Notary\n Public.\n\n Sub-section (a) provides that the\n function of the Notary is to verify,\n authenticate, certify and at least the\n execution of any instrument.\n\n \nSection 10\n of the Notaries Rules 1956\n prescribes the Fees payable to a\n Notary Public for doing any Notarial\n Act\n \nSection 11\n of The Notaries Act, 1952\n prescribes the Functions of a Notary\n Reliance is placed on \nsection 11 (1)\n,\n (2), (8) and 9\n \nSection 12\n of the Notaries Rules,\n 1956 deals with the Seal of a Notary\n\n (a) As per the provisions of \nsection 85\n\n of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n there have to be two conditions which\n are to exist together that are necessary\n for the presumption as to Power of\n Attorney to come into play i.e.\n\n - Execution before the Notary AND\n\n - Document should be authenticated\n by the Notary\n\n At the outset it is submitted that in\n terms of the provisions of section 85\n\n36 \nChitra Garg Vs.

Further, in support of the argument that the plaintiff\nhas not subjected herself to the cross examination and, thus, she\nhas to face the consequences, Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 has\nreferred to the following judgments:\n\nA.

As against the aforesaid arguments, on behalf of the\nplaintiff, it was submitted that since in the present suit, the issues\npertaining to the recovery of the possession of the suit property\nhave already been dropped in the light of the defendant no.2\nhaving ceded the ground, the only issue remains to be decided is\nthe quantum of mesne profits and since that is primarily in the\nnature of a judicial inquiry, plaintiff being a senior citizen aged\nabout 66 years, was unable to appear and depose before the court\nowing to covid-19 crisis and, therefore, she executed a special\npower of attorney in favor of PW1 only for the purpose of\nproducing certified copies of rent deed and mathematic\ncalculation.\n\nxxii. Alongside the discussion on the aforesaid issue,\nanother legal submission can also be ensnared herein that the\nplaintiff has not entered into the witness box herself and not\ntendered herself to cross examine and thus, adverse interference\nhas to be drawn against her.\n\nxxiii. I, to some extent, concur with the submission of Ld.\nSenior counsel for the plaintiff that since defendant no.2 has\nalready surrendered her alleged claim of ownership in respect of\nthe suit property and peaceful possession thereto has been handed\nover to the plaintiff, the substantial issues framed earlier have\nbeen subtracted and replaced by the two issues which only touch\nupon the aspect of the grant of mesne profits and interest thereof\nin favour of the plaintiff and therefore, even if the plaintiff\n41 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:49:24 +0530\n herself has not entered into the witness box to depose qua the\nsame, the cause of action in so far as the mesne profits are\nconcerned does not get impeded as can be gathered from the\njudgment of division bench of High Court of Delhi in \nNational\nRadio and Electronic Corporation Vs. Motion Pictures\nAssociation\n, 122 (2005) DLT 629 that even if no substantial\nevidence is led by the plaintiff in respect of the rent of the\nproperties, judicial notice can be taken thereof to appreciate the\nrate of rent and fix the quantum thereto. This would also\nsomehow strengthen the argument of Ld. Senior Counsel for the\nplaintiff that the assessment of grant and quantum of the mesne\nprofits is in the realm of being an inquiry and thus, it can be\nsafely concluded that even if there is no evidence led by the\nplaintiff who is claiming his/her entitlement to the grant of the\nmesne profits, the court can take judicial notice of the prevalent\nrate of rent of any particular area and proceed to pass the\nnecessary order. Therefore, the contention of the defendant that\nplaintiff was incumbent upon to enter into the witness box and\nsubject herself to cross examination, does not hold any water.\nThe judgments relied upon in this regard are facts centric and\ncompletely distinguishable as in none of those cases, the\ntestimony of the attorney was limited to the extent of mesne\nprofits.\n\nxxiv. In so far as competency of PW1 Sh. Sanjay Goel is\nconcerned, I take the discussion forward by dealing with the legal\nobjections raised in regard to the admissibility of power of\nattorney Ex.PW1/1. The first submission in this regard is that the\nplaintiff had not sought the leave of the court to get PW1\n42 Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:49:33 +0530\n examined as her special power of attorney holder and, therefore,\nhis affidavit is of no value to the present suit. Ld. Counsel for\ndefendant no.2 also argued that PW1 did not have any personal\nknowledge relating to the present suit and his testimony is based\non the knowledge gained either from the plaintiff or the counsel.\n\nxxv. Further, to buttress his arguments that special power\nof attorney holder cannot depose on the merits of the case in\nplace of the plaintiff, reliance is placed upon the following\njudgments:\n\nA. Janki Vashdeo Bhojwani Vs. Indusind Bank Ltd\n, (\n2005)\n2SCC 217\nB. Man Kaur (dead) by LRs Vs. Hartar Singh Sangha\n,\n(\n2010) 10 SCC 512\nC. S Kesari Hauman Goud Vs.

Before coming to grips with this issue, let us have a\nglance at the cross examination of PW1 on this aspect. PW1 was\ncross examined as to when did he meet the plaintiff for the first\ntime and where, to which he replied having met the plaintiff\nabout five to six months before his deposition in the office of\nAdvocate Sh. Arvind Bhatt. PW1 was then also questioned as to\nwhy did he choose to represent the plaintiff in the present case\nwhich is pending since 1993 despite only knowing her five to six\nmonths, to which he responded that he was associated with\n\n43 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:49:42 +0530\n charitable institution and in connection with a matter similar to\nthe present case, he entered into discussion with the plaintiff\nduring which plaintiff desired to donate money for some good\ncause if recovered as mesne profits and for this reason, PW1 was\nappointed as representative of the plaintiff.\n\nxxvii. To the query that whatever has been stated in the\naffidavit of PW1 was informed to him by the plaintiff or her\ncounsel, PW1 affirmed that his statement in the affidavit was on\nthe basis of the information provided by the plaintiff as well as\ncounsel and also on the basis of the record which he had seen.\n\nxxviii. There is no yardstick to assess as to when a person\ncan become competent to appear as a witness for other person.\nThus, the fact that PW1 was acquainted with the plaintiff only for\n5-6 months before his deposition is no bar to discard his\ntestimony. In this regard, I observe that by virtue of \nSection 118\n\nof Evidence Act, 1872, all persons are competent to appear as a\nwitness who are capable of understanding the questions and\ngiving rational response thereto. The exception carved out is in\nrespect of those persons who owing to some disability are unable\nto depose before the court. It is not the case herein that PW1 Sh.\nSanjay Goel was incompetent to appear as a witness being unable\nto understand the questions and respond thereto. There is no\nimpediment in him appearing as a witness subject only to the\nembargo of not deposing anything about the act or the transaction\nof which plaintiff only had the personal knowledge. \nIn Pawan\nKumar Dalmia Vs. M/s HCL Info Systems Limited and Ors,\ndate of decision 13.03.2012, High Court of Delhi, it was\n44 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:49:51 +0530\n observed in paragraph 10 that evidence of a person is governed\nby the \nEvidence Act, 1872\n, and any person who is aware of the\nfacts of the case and whose evidence would be of relevance is\ncompetent to depose. A witness can depose as per facts in his\nknowledge or as per records.\n\nxxix. Keeping in line with the aforesaid view that a\nwitness can depose as per records, I further rely upon \nBhimppa\nand Ors Vs. Allisab and Ors\n, 27.02.2006, Karnataka High\nCourt, which held in para 15 that it is open to the plaintiff to\nexamine the power of attorney holder, to produce the documents\nthrough him, mark the same and examine witnesses to prove the\nsaid documents if it is denied.\n\nxxx. Therefore, the contention that the evidence of a\npower of attorney holder cannot prove the case of the plaintiff in\nall cases is not correct and that is not the law \nlaid down by\n the\nSupreme Court in \nJanki Vashdeo Bhojwani Vs. Indusind Bank\nLtd\n, (2005) 2SCC 217 which is also relied by Ld. Counsel for\nDefendant no.2. But, Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 is correct to\nthe extent that the testimony of PW1 in this case on the aspects\nnot within his knowledge, and of which knowledge has been\ngained from the plaintiff and her counsel as admitted by him in\nhis cross-examination, cannot be read in evidence.\n \nThus, the\ntestimony of PW1 can be read and considered only to the extent\nof furnishing the comparable lease deeds on record and nothing\nmore than that, meaning thereby that his deposition that liability\nof the four defendants is joint and several, images of visiting\ncards of staff Ex.PW1/5(Colly), letter dated 8.09.2016 written by\n45 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:49:59 +0530\n Principal Ms. Radha Agarwal Ex. PW1/6, cannot be considered.\nThe other Judgments relied on behalf of defendant no.2 need not\nbe referred to as there is no dispute qua the legal position cited\ntherein.\n\nxxxi. It has been further argued on behalf of defendant\nno.2 that the notarization of special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1\nhas not been in consonance with the \nNotaries Act\n 1952 and the\nNotaries Rules. Further, there is no notarial adhesive fee stamp\naffixed as per column no.6 of the notarial register as detailed in\nForm 15 of the Notaries Rules 1956. Also, it was argued that in\nterms of the provision of \nSection 85\n of the Indian Evidence Act,\nit cannot be presumed that the special power of attorney\nEx.PW1/1 was executed and authenticated by notary public as\nthe same does not contain the signature of the notary and the\nauthentication certificate.\n\nxxxii. A power of attorney is a mode of creating an express\nagency. It is a written instrument executed by a principal to\nappoint an agent to act for the principal in one or more\ntransactions. There is no specific mode prescribed for the\nexecution of power of attorney. Yet it is not uncommon to\nnotarize the execution of the power of attorney. An aspect of\nnotarization is governed by provision of \nNotaries Act\n 1952.\nUnder the said act, a notary is appointed by Centre or State to do\nspecified acts inter alia to verify authenticate, certify or attest the\nexecution of any instrument. Further, under the provision of\n\nSection 85\n of Indian Evidence Act, a power of attorney executed\nbefore and authenticated by notary public carries a presumption\n\n46 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:50:08 +0530\n that it was properly executed.\n\nxxxiii. In Smt. Kamla Rani and Ors Vs. Texmaco Ltd,\nMANU/DE/7343/2007, High Court of Delhi explained the\neffect of notarization as follows:\n\n \"Authentication by a\n notary public is a solemn\n act performed by the notary\n public whose duty is to\n ensure that the executant is\n the person before him and\n is identified to his\n satisfaction. Once a\n document is authenticated\n by a notary public, it will\n be presumed that the\n document was duly\n executed and was in order.\n\n The use of the expression\n 'shall presume' shows that\n the section is mandatory\n and the court has to\n presume that all necessary\n requirements for the proper\n execution of the power of\n attorney were duly fulfilled\n before the notary public. As\n observed in AIR 1984 363\n E.C. & E. Co. Ltd. v. J.E.\n Works, if 2 conditions are\n satisfied, firstly the power\n of attorney being executed\n before a notary public and\n secondly it being\n authenticated by a notary\n public, a presumption\n would arise under Section\n 85 about the executant of\n the power of attorney.\n\n 34. Onus would thus lie on\n the opposite party to prove\n to the contrary.\n\n 35. It is well settled that\n authentication would mean\n more than mere execution.\n\n \nWhere proof of\n authentication surfaces,\n47 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:50:16 +0530\n benefit of Section 85 has to\n be granted.\"\n\nxxxiv. While a power of attorney executed before and\nauthenticated by notary carries a presumption as to its due\nexecution, the absence of such authentication would not render\nthe document invalid. Explaining this aspect, Delhi High Court in\ncase titled as \nGrafitek International Vs. K K Kaura\n, 2002\nSCC Online DLT held as under:\n\n \"Merely because the power\n of attorney is not duly\n notarized does not mean\n that the concerned person\n was not authorized to\n institute the suit.\n\n Notarization raises\n presumption as to its\n authentication and no more.\n\n Notarization of power of\n attorney is a matter of\n procedure and raises the\n presumption of authority of\n the person to institute the\n suit. In other words, it does\n not mean that power of\n attorney executed in favor\n of a particular person but\n not duly notarized does not\n confer power upon the\n person to institute the suit\".\n\nxxxv. It is, thus, clear from the aforenoted judgment that\nthe authentication of the document by a notary public would raise\na presumption of the document being duly executed and in order.\nHowever, notarization is a matter of procedure and it does not\nmean that power of attorney executed in the favour of a particular\nperson but not duly notarized does not confer any power upon the\nsaid person. The implication of this for the present case would be\n48 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n BUDHIRAJA\n NAVJEET\n Date:\n\n BUDHIRAJA 2023.10.09\n 15:50:23\n +0530\n that if the special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1 has been proved\nto be duly notarized as per the \nNotaries Act\n 1952 and the\nNotaries Rules 1956 then a presumption under \nSection 85\n of\nIndian Evidence Act can be raised as to its authenticity, thereby\ndispensing with the requirement of its formal proof. But the\nperusal of the special power of attorney Ex.PW1/1 reveals that\nthe same is lacking in fulfilling the compliances as per the\n\nNotaries Act\n 1952 as pointed out by Ld. Counsel for defendant\nno.2 in detail as I do not find any authentication being done by\nthe concerned notary or any identification being done in the form\nof issuing a particular number which gets entered in the notarial\nregister as per the Notaries Rules 1956. In fact, the attorney does\nnot reveal the signatures and identification of the Notary. Thus, to\nthis extent, the arguments advanced on behalf of defendant no. 2\nare meritorious and the necessary presumption as enunciated in\n\nSection 85\n of Indian Evidence Act cannot be raised herein.\n\nxxxvi. The other way to prove the special power of attorney\nwas to examine its author who is the plaintiff herein to the effect\nthat she has executed the special power of attorney in favour of\nPW1 Sh. Sanjay Goel to depose in the present suit. It is a matter\nof record that plaintiff has not examined herself to prove the\nspecial power of attorney Ex.PW1/1 but it is to be seen now\nwhether at the time of marking and tendering of special power of\nattorney in evidence by PW1, any objection was raised on behalf\nof defendant no.2 as to mode of proof of the said attorney.\n\nxxxvii. At this juncture, I deal with the argument of Ld.\nCounsel for Defendant no.2 that mere marking or exhibit on a\n\n49 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n \n2023.10.09\n 15:50:31 +0530\n document does not amount to its proof and in this regard, he has\nrelied upon the judgment of Supreme Court of India in \nLife\nInsurance Corporation of India and Another Vs Ram Pal\nSingh Bisen\n, (2010) 4 SCC 491.\n\nxxxviii. Ld. counsel further highlighted that the parties who\nallege any document to be bogus has to prove nothing until the\nparty relying upon the document establishes its genuineness,\nwhich was held by the Supreme Court of India in \nSubhra\nMukherjee Vs. Bharat Coking Coal Ltd\n, AIR 2000 SC 1203.\n\nLd. counsel further referred to judgment in \nRajwati Devi Vs.\nJoint\n director, AIR 1989 Patna 66, in support of his arguments\nthat if no witness is examined for proving the document, it\namounts to procedural infirmity.\n\nxxxix. The examination in chief of PW1 dated 27.02.2021\ndoes not reveal that at the time of tendering the special power of\nattorney in evidence as Ex.PW1/1 any objection was raised as to\nthe mode of proof of this document. It is a settled legal position\nthat the objection with regard to the mode and manner of proof of\na document has to be raised at the time of marking/exhibition of\nthe document and in case of failure on the part of the opposite\nparty to raise any such objection, he/she is precluded to raise it at\nthe later stage. \nIn this regard, I hereby rely upon the judgment of\n\nR.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder Vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami\n& V.P. Temple & Anr\n, date of decision 08.10.2003 wherein the\nSupreme Court has laid down the following salutary principle\nwhich has been followed in catena of judgments.\n\n \"Privy Council in Padman\n\n50 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:50:40 +0530\n and Others vs. Hanwanta\n and Others [AIR 1915 PC\n 111] did not permit the\n appellant to take objection\n to the admissibility of a\n registered copy of a will in\n appeal for the first time. It\n was held that this objection\n should have been taken in\n the trial court. It was\n observed:\n\n \"The defendants have now\n appeal to the Majesty in\n Council, and the case has\n been argued on their behalf\n in great detail. It was urged\n in the course of the\n argument that a registered\n copy of the will of 1898\n was admitted in evidence\n without sufficient\n foundation being led for its\n admission. No objection,\n however, appears to have\n been taken in the first court\n against the copy obtained\n from the Registrar's office\n being put in evidence. Had\n such objection being made\n at the time, the District\n Judge, who tried the case in\n the first instance, would\n probably have seen that the\n deficiency was supplied.\n\n Their lordships think that\n there is no substance in the\n present contention.\"\n\n \nSimilar is the view\n expressed by this Court in\n \nP.C.Purushothama Reddiar\n vs. S.Perumal\n [1972 (2)\n SCR 646]. In this case the\n police reports were\n admitted in evidence\n without any objection and\n the objection was sought to\n be taken in appeal\n regarding the admissibility\n of the reports. Rejecting the\n contention it was observed:\n\n51 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n \"Before leaving this case it\n is necessary to refer to one\n of the contention taken by\n Mr. Ramamurthi, learned\n counsel for the respondent.\n\n He contended that the\n police reports referred to\n earlier are inadmissible in\n evidence as the Head-\n\n constables who covered\n those meetings have not\n been examined in the case.\n\n Those reports were marked\n without any objection.\n\n Hence it is not open to the\n respondent now to object to\n their admissibility - see\n Bhagat Ram V. Khetu Ram\n and Anr. [AIR 1929 PC\n 110].\"\n\n Since documents A30 and\n A34 were admitted in\n evidence without any\n objection, the High Court\n erred in holding that these\n documents were\n inadmissible being photo\n copies, the originals of\n which were not produced.\n\n So is the observation of the\n High Court that the\n photocopy of the rent note\n was not readable. The\n photocopy was admitted in\n evidence, as already stated.\n\n It was read by the trial\n court as also by the first\n Appellate Court. None of\n the said two courts appear\n to have felt any difficulty in\n reading the document and\n understanding and\n appreciating its contents.\n\n \nMay be, that the copy had\n fainted by the time the\n matter came up for hearing\n before the High Court. The\n High Court if it felt any\n difficulty in comfortable\n reading of the document\n\n52 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n then should have said so at\n the time of hearing and\n afforded the parties an\n opportunity of either\n producing the original or a\n readable copy of the\n document. Nothing such\n was done. The High Court\n has not even doubted the\n factum of the contents of\n the document having been\n read by the two courts\n below, drawn deductions\n therefrom and based their\n finding of fact on this\n document as well. All that\n the High Court has said is\n that the document was\n inadmissible in evidence\n being a photocopy and with\n that view we have already\n expressed our\n disagreement. Nothing,\n therefore, turns on the\n observation of the High\n Court that the document\n was not readable when the\n matter came up for hearing\n before it....\"\n\nxl. The requirement of raising the objection at the time\nof marking/exhibition of the document is essential as that would\napprise the party to take corrective steps to prove the particular\ndocument in regard to which the objection may have raised and,\ntherefore, in the absence of no objection, other party would be\ngiven an impression that the opposite party has no objection in\nregard to the admissibility of this document.\n\nxli. \nIn light of the aforesaid position, since on behalf of\ndefendant, at the time of tendering of the special power of\nattorney in evidence and marking the same as Ex.PW1/1, no\n\n53 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n objection was taken as to mode and manner of proof of this\ndocument, at the stage of final arguments this objection cannot be\npermitted to be raised.\n\nxlii. As regards the Judgment in \nLIC of India v. Ram\nPal Singh\n, mentioned above, on behalf of defendantno.2, it\nthough says that mere marking of a document is not the proof of\nits contents, there is no dispute about this, but \nin that case\n it was\nin the context of admission/denial of documents, and the Court\nfound that even if documents are admitted, its contents were\nproved. But the position is different where document is being\ntendered in evidence and no objection is then raised as to its\nmode, then that document cannot be discarded.\n \nI further stand\nfortified on this by another recent judgment of Supreme Court in\n\nLachhmi Narain Singh v. Sarjug Singh\n, 17 August, 2021, para\n23 and 24 of which are worth noting here:\n\n \n23. This Court in the\n opinion written by Justice\n S. H. Kapadia\n in \nDayamathi Bai v. KM\n Shaffi4\n has similarly held\n that objection as to the\n mode of proof falls within\n procedural law. Therefore,\n such objections could be\n waived. Moreover,\n objection is to be taken\n before the document is\n marked as an exhibit and\n admitted in Court.\n\n 24. \nIn view of the\n foregoing discussion, it is\n clear that plea regarding\n mode of proof cannot be\n permitted to be taken at the\n appellate stage for the first\n time, if not raised before\n54 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n the trial Court at the\n appropriate stage. This is to\n avoid prejudice to the party\n who produced the certified\n copy of an original\n document without protest\n by the other side. If such\n objection was raised before\n trial court, then the\n concerned party could have\n cured the mode of proof by\n summoning the original\n copy of document. But\n such opportunity may not\n be available or possible at a\n later stage. Therefore,\n allowing such objection to\n be raised during the\n appellate stage would put\n the party (who placed\n certified copy on record\n instead of original copy) in\n a jeopardy & would\n seriously prejudice interests\n of that 4 (2004) 7 SCC 107\n party.\n \nIt will also be\n inconsistent with the rule of\n fair play as propounded by\n Justice Ashok Bhan in the\n case of \nR.V.E.\n Venkatachala\n (Supra).\n\nxliii. On the aspect of the original power of attorney of\nPW1, he responded in his cross examination that he had not\nbrought it that day and sought to bring it on the next day. Ld.\ncounsel for plaintiff then clarified that the power of attorney in\nfavour of PW1 was already exhibited while his affidavit was\ntendered into evidence and copy of power of attorney was given\nexhibit mark after showing the original document. Thereafter, no\nsuch counter suggestion was posed on behalf of the defendant\nno.2 that the original of the power of attorney was not shown at\nthe time of tendering of evidence by PW1. Thus, the grouse of\n\n55 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2 assailing the competency of PW1\nand non-production of the original power of attorney falls face\ndown. Needless to say, on the contents of special power of\nattorney PW1/1, there is no challenge in the cross-examination of\nPW1.\n\nxliv. The upshot of the aforesaid discourse is that\ndefendant no.2 has not been able to substantiate the legal\nsubmissions put forth which would warrant the case of the\nplaintiff to fail altogether. Defendant no.2 has miserably failed to\njustify her occupation of the suit property from the date of the\ninstitution of the suit till 24.02.2020 when the suit property was\nhanded over to the plaintiff. It is a foregone conclusion that the\nunauthorized and illegal occupation of the suit property for the\nsaid period has deprived the plaintiff to enjoy the fruits of the\nsaid property. It is also pertinent to highlight here that after the\ndeath of defendant no.2 on 26.08.2011, who was allegedly\nrunning a Kindergarten school in the suit property, her LRs still\nperpetuated in the illegal occupation of the suit property which is\nevident from the admission of DW1 in question no.54 of his\ncross examination that his sister Ms. Radha Bansal continued to\nlook after the school. There never was any offer to hand over the\npossession of the suit property to its rightful claimant who was\nthe plaintiff. Thus, defendant no.2 without any iota of doubt, has\nto be saddled with the liability to pay damages/mesne profits to\nthe plaintiff in respect of the suit property.\n\nxlv. Having now dealt with the entitlement of the\nplaintiff to the grant of mesne profits in respect of the suit\n56 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n property, the next step would be to assess the quantum and\nduration of the same. Though, Ld. Counsel for defendant no.2\nargued that issue no.1 merely is to the extent of entitlement of the\nplaintiff to claim damages/mesne profits, without any whisper\nabout its extent, however, the extent of mesne profits, its\nquantum and duration are implicit in the entitlement of the\nplaintiff to claim the same, and if the plaintiff is found entitled to\nthe mesne profits, the next logical step would be to ascertain its\nquantum.\n\nxlvi. On the aspect of mesne profits, Ld. Counsel for\ndefendant further assailed the case of the plaintiff and took\numbrage on the plaintiff invoking the methods of annual\nescalation of the property value and expected return on the land\nrates as the plaintiff had approached the court seeking damages\nfrom the defendant on the basis of rent of comparable leases. Ld.\nCounsel further emphasised that the deposition of PW1 in\nparagraph 5, 7, 8 and 10 is beyond the pleading and cannot be\nread in evidence.\n\nxlvii. Ld. Counsel further urged that plaintiff has further\nfailed to prove that she is entitled to the sum of Rs.50,000/- per\nmonth towards the damages/mesne profits as claimed in the\nplaint. Ld. Counsel further highlighted that the lease deeds filed\nby DW1 are Ex.DW1/3 and which show the prevalent rent in\nrespect of the similarly situated properties and even better\nproperties during the relevant time period i.e.1992-93 and thus\njudicial notice cannot be taken and judicial notice of 14%\nincrease rent every year is not warranted. It was further\n57 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n highlighted that the rate of rent of the suit property was Rs.1800/-\nper month and when the suit was filed in the year 1993, the\ntenancy was still subsisting and rent at that time was Rs.1800/-\nonly which is also evident from the fact that plaintiff in the year\n2022 made categorical statement before MCD that rent of the suit\nproperty has not increased from Rs.1800/- per month. It is further\nargued that annexure F has not been proved in accordance with\nlaw as the plaintiff in his examination in chief dated 27.02.2021\nhas not relied upon it and as such, the same cannot be taken into\nconsideration. Further, it is pointed out on behalf of the defendant\nno.2 that the lease deeds sought to be placed in evidence pertain\nto commercial property and the suit property being residential in\nnature, lease deeds are of no assistance to the case of the plaintiff.\n\nxlviii. All the legal systems which govern the civilized\nnation of the world agree upon the basic principle of natural\njustice to obtain reparation for wrongs or infringement of legal\nrights. In other ways, the law of nature gives primary right to a\ncompensation for injuries. Mesne profit is one such right to\ncompensation granted against injuria i.e breach of legal right.\nMesne profit is a positive right available against infringement of\nprivate legal right. Main object of awarding mesne profit is to\ncompensate the actual owner of the property for all the losses\nhe/she suffered. In other words, the object of awarding of decree\nof mesne profit is to compensate a person who has been kept out\nof possession and deprived of enjoyment of his/her property even\nthough he/she was entitled to possession of the property.\n\nxlix. Mesne profits is defined under \nSection 2(12)\n CPC as\n58 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n under:\n\n \"(12) \"mesne profits\" of\n property means those\n profits which the person in\n wrongful possession of\n such property actually\n received or might with\n ordinary diligence have\n received therefrom,\n together with interest on\n such profits, but shall not\n include profits due to\n improvements made by the\n person in wrongful\n possession;\"\n\nl. From the analysis of the above stated definition, one\ncan conclude that mesne profits are the profits which the person\nin unlawful possession actually earned or might have earned with\nthe ordinary diligence.\n\nli. \nIn case titled as \nNataraja Achari Vs. Blanbal\nAmmal\n, AIR 1980 Madras 2228, taking into the consideration\nthe definition of mesne profit provided under \nSection 2(12)\n CPC,\nHigh Court observed that there are three different types of cases\nin which question of rights of profits areas (I) suit for ejectment\nor for recovery of possession of immovable property from a\nperson in possession without title, together with a claim for past\nor past and future mesne profits. (2) Suits for partition by one or\nmore tenants-in-common against others with a claim for account\nof past or past and future profits. (3) Suits for partition by a\nmember of a joint Hindu family with a claim for an account from\nthe manager. The court further observed that in the first case the\npossession of the defendant not being lawful, plaintiff is entitled\nto recover of mesne profits, being in the nature of damages.\n\n59 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n lii. In the instant case as well, we are dealing with a\nsituation where the defendant no.2, in contest to the suit sought to\njustify her possession over the suit property on the pretext of\nownership being accrued to her by way of adverse possession\nbeing in occupation from 1977 till 1989, and when the present\nplaintiff became owner of the suit property and instituted the\npresent suit to reclaim the possession from defendants, defendant\nno.2 persisted to retain the possession but eventually gave up the\nsame in February 2020. It is obvious that defendant no.2 has\nmiserably failed to prove her claim of ownership on the basis of\nadverse possession, and therefore, her possession right from the\ninstitution of the suit in the year 1993 till February 2020 when\nthe possession was given up, is found to be unlawful, for which\nplaintiff is entitled to claim the mesne profits in the form of\ndamages/compensation.\n\nliii. As per the affidavit of PW1 Ex.PW1/A, the suit\nproperty is built on a free hold plot measuring 308 sq yard land\nwith 2 1/4th storey residential house on it. Photographs of the\nsame are Ex.PW1/2 and the layout plan of the suit property is\nEx.P6. The suit property is stated to be situated in a prime area\nabutting a wide road, is well connected, is three sides open\nproperty, nearby park, market and even police station for security.\nIn the suit property, admittedly a children play school was being\nrun by the defendant. But as already noted, PW1 was only\ncompetent to furnish the lease deeds and mark them and at the\nmost assist in computation, rest all deposition of his is on the\nbasis of the knowledge obtained from the plaintiff as admitted by\n60 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:51:09 +0530\n him in his cross-examination. So, the description and the location\nof the suit property given by him in his affidavit cannot be read\nin evidence.\n\nliv. Let us find out from pleadings and other admissible\nevidence the measurements of the suit property, location, its\nphysical structure, existing at the time of institution of the suit.\nAs per the plaint, the suit property is measuring 318 sq yards\nfacing east and abutting on 60ft wide road, which is constructed\nto be 2 ¼ story in the form of residential house. Though, in the\ncorresponding written statement, defendant no.2 had oppugned\nthe identification and aforesaid structure of the suit property,\nhowever, that denial is without any specification. DW1 in his\ncross examination also acknowledged that Ex.PW1/2 and\nEx.PW1/3 (colly) are the photographs of the suit property.\nFurthermore, DW1 in his affidavit Ex.DW1/A, in paragraph 19\nhas described the layout of the suit property as under:\n\n \"a. Ground Floor: Entrance\n Lobby (partly converted\n into a makeshift Principal\n Office) + Living Room +\n Kitchen + Single Bedroom\n + Toilet + Open garage (+\n staircase leading to First\n Floor)\n b. First Floor : Staircase\n Corridor + Two bedrooms\n with attached toilets and\n balconies\n c. Barsati Floor : Store\n Room/Servant Room +\n Servant Toilet \"\n\nlv. DW1 has further stated in his affidavit that Mr. Pires\nhad his residence on the entire ground floor (till when he died)\n\n61 Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:51:16 +0530\n excepting the principal office and kindergarten school operating\nin the two rooms on the first floor of the suit property. He further\nstated that post his demise, the kindergarten school began to\noperate from the ground floor of the suit property with first floor\nserving as music room and library. He further stated that in\nMarch 2006, Municipal Corporation of Delhi prohibited the use\nof the first floor for operating a Kindergarten School and only\nground floor on designated roads can be used for operating the\nKindergarten School and, therefore, since September 2006,\nground floor was used for the purpose of Kindergarten School\nonly till March 2018. Thus, the position in regard to the physical\nstructure of the suit property, is clear that it measures 318 sq\nyards situated on 60ft wide road comprising of 2 ¼ story.\n\nlvi. The controversy now boils down to as to what would\nbe the rate of mesne profits which could be stated to be existing\nat the time of institution of the suit i.e. 10.11.1993 in respect of\nthe suit property.\n\nlvii. Ld. Senior counsel for the plaintiff pointed out the\ncross examination of DW1 in regard to the user of the suit\nproperty. DW1 was questioned as to during the period\n10.11.1993 till 24.02.2020, his mother i.e. defendant no.2, he\nhimself or any of his sisters (Neeta, Priti, Radha) ever resided in\nthe suit property and if not, who was then residing, upon which\nhe was unable to state whether his mother or any of his sisters\never resided in the suit property.\n\nlviii. DW1 was also queried as to the period between\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n62 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 NAVJEET NAVJEET\n BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:51:25 +0530\n 11.11.1993 till 31.03.2001 was the school running in the suit\nproperty had any bank account to which he replied in affirmative.\nIn regard to the collection of the fees, he also responded that all\nthe fees and expenses would be recorded in the books of the bank\naccount of school and credit and debit to the bank account would\nhave been made as per the books of account. These books of\naccounts have not been produced on record on behalf of\ndefendant no.2. Thus, it is to be presumed that defendant no.2\nhad not come clean on the profits received while being in\nwrongful possession of suit property.\n\nlix. Moving further, as already noted above that on\nbehalf of the plaintiff, the various lease deeds placed on record as\ncomparables for quantifying mesne profits pertinent to the period\n2013 onwards and as such there is no material on behalf of the\nplaintiff as to what was the rental/damages existing at the time of\ninstitution of the suit. PW1 also affirmed in his cross-\nexamination that rent deeds placed on record were only from the\nyear 2012-13 and not prior to that. In regard to a specific query\nas to when the lease deeds filed by PW1 pertain to 2013-14\nonwards, would it be correct to say that there are no comparable\nrent deeds available for the year 1992-93 upon which PW1\nresponded that comparison can be made on the basis of 'base\npoint' and thereby prevailing rent can be calculated. PW1 then\nreferred to annexure G which was given Mark X to compare the\nprevailing rent in the year 1992 with the prevailing rent in the\nyear 2013.\n\nlx. Defendant no.2, on the other hand, through the\n63 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n 2023.10.09\n 15:51:33 +0530\n\n deposition of DW1 has placed on record some lease deeds\npertaining to the period between 1992-95 in the form of Mark A3\nin his deposition, which have not been repudiated on behalf of\nthe plaintiff.\n\nlxi. Now let us examine the lease deeds Mark A3 relied\nupon by DW1 in his evidence. Paragraph 40 of his affidavit is\nlaid herein below:\n\n \"I state that the Registered\n Leases (certified true copy)\n of Residential Properties, in\n an around the Suit\n Property, as leased out\n between 1992 to 1995,\n more particularly of the\n following properties are\n filed along with the present\n affidavit as Mark A-3. The\n Defendants have named the\n said leases in their list of\n witnesses as documents to\n be summoned from the\n office of Sub-Registrar\n concerned and proved as\n per law:\n\n i. E 98 Greater Kailash 1,\n New Delhi dated 31 May\n\n 1992\n\n ii. M 57 Greater Kailash 1,\n New Delhi dated 22 July\n\n 1992\n\n iii.

S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed by\n NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:51:41 +0530\n area of the aforesaid property to be 360 sq yards plus, although\nfrom none of the said lease agreements, the measurement of built\nup area and carpet area is made out. Nevertheless, on bone deep\nanalysis of those lease agreements, it is noted that these\nagreements pertain to single floor of the property and the rent\nranges from Rs.4500/- per month to Rs.10,000/- per month. The\nrelevant details related to the said lease agreements are extracted\nherein below:\n\n The first lease agreement\n dated 31.05.1992 is in\n respect of ground floor of\n property bearing No. E-98,\n Greater Kailash Part I, New\n Delhi and the rental is\n stated to be Rs.6000/- per\n month.\n\n The second lease\n agreement dated\n 22.07.1992 is in respect of\n ground floor of property\n bearing No. M-57, Greater\n Kailash Part I, New Delhi\n and the rental is stated to be\n Rs.4500/- per month.\n\n The third lease agreement\n dated 21.04.1992 is in\n respect of ground floor of\n property bearing No. M-14,\n Greater Kailash Part I, New\n Delhi and the rental is\n stated to be Rs.10000/- per\n month.\n\n The fourth lease agreement\n dated 13.10.1993 is in\n respect of ground floor of\n property bearing No. W-\n\n 120, Greater Kailash Part I,\n New Delhi and the rental is\n stated to be Rs.10000/- per\n month.\n\n The fifth lease agreement\n dated 20.06.1995 is in\n respect of ground floor of\n property bearing No. E-\n\n65 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:51:49 +0530\n 116, Greater Kailash Part I,\n New Delhi and the rental is\n stated to be Rs.5000/- per\n month.\n\nlxiii. It can be safely deduced from the aforesaid lease\ndeeds that all the lease deeds pertain to only ground floor of a\nparticular property. Furthermore, none of the properties is shown\nto be situated at R Block, Greater Kailash Part I, New Delhi as is\nthe case with the suit property. It is not clear whether any of these\nproperties was situated on 60ft wide road. Thus, these lease deeds\ncannot be considered as a complete yardstick to fix the quantum\nof mesne profits in respect of the suit property. Needless to say,\nthe path to ascertain the mesne profits for the year 1993 i.e three\ndecades ago, is not easy to tread on. But, in the form of these\nlease agreements, we are able to gather some inkling as to the\nexisting rate of rent in Greater Kailash Part I, New Delhi area\nbetween the period 1992 to 1995 and, thus, some support can be\ndrawn from it to arrive at a base figure of the rate of mesne\nprofits which can be fixed at the time of institution of the suit. It\nis, however, to be kept in mind of these lease deeds pertain to\nonly single floor whereas the suit property admittedly comprises\nof 2 ¼ floors and the rental would have to be counted and\ncomputed in accordance therewith.\n\nlxiv. In so far as valuation of the suit property is\nconcerned, PW1 has relied upon the report Ex.PW1/7 which was\nfiled on behalf of defendantno.2 dated 28.03.1996 from an\nindependent valuer Sh. T S Ratnam, Additional Director General,\nCPW Retired. The said report records the suit property to be\nsituated in high class locality with excellent proximity to civic\n66 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:51:56 +0530\n amenities. It also records that the plinth of the suit property on\nthe ground floor is 1653 sq ft, on first floor is 1655 sq ft and the\nsecond floor is 400 sq ft. The said report valued the suit property\nto be Rs.69.89 lacs in February 1992 and Rs.81.48 lacs in the\nyear 1993.\n\nlxv. Let us now see what methods PW1 has cited towards\ncomputation of mesne profits. As per the affidavit Ex.PW1/A, the\nthree methods to compute the quantum of mesne profits are, the\nfirst method is of judicial notice based on various judgments \nlaid\ndown by\n High Court of Delhi; the second method is of exemplars\nor renting in the vicinity and the third method is of expected\nreturn on notified land rates.\n\nlxvi. The admitted rate of rent of the suit property in the\nyear 1971 was Rs.1800/- per month with effect from 01.10.1971.\nThe mesne profits are to be quantified from the institution of the\nsuit onwards till 24.02.2020 when the keys of the suit property\nwere delivered to the plaintiff before High Court of Delhi.\n\nlxvii. In so far as the aforenoted second method is\nconcerned, PW1/plaintiff has relied upon various lease deeds\nEx.PW2/1 to Ex.PW2/54 which were brought on record by PW1\nand later on proved by PW2 Sh. Upender, Record Attendant,\nOffice of Sub-Registrar-VA, Hauz Khas, Mehrauli, New Delhi.\nHowever, these exemplars pertain to the period from 2013\nonwards and since we have to assess the mesne profits from the\nyear 1993 onwards, these exemplars would be of little assistance.\nThough PW1 has sought to justify the reverse computation to\n67 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:52:04 +0530\n arrive at base figure of mesne profits in 1993 during his\nquestioning on behalf of defendant no.2, but that involves too\nmuch of a guess work which is not feasible to adopt. We are now\nleft with the aforesaid method first or third, either of which can\nbe brought into picture to assess the quantum of mesne profits in\nthe present suit along with the comparable lease deeds Mark A3\nplaced on behalf of defendant no.2.\n\nlxviii. After having examined various case laws of the\nHigh Courts, it is found that in majority of the cases, the\nSupreme Court and High Courts, where the evidence is scant,\nhave adopted the first method for calculating the mesne profits\non the basis of 10-15% annual escalation in the rate of rent and\ninterest thereof. I would now like to present some of those case\nlaws and the relevant observations made therein:\n\n(1) Pradeep Kumar Vs. Hazarilal, date of decision 22.02.2008,\nSupreme Court:\n\n \"4. We have considered the\n arguments advanced by the\n learned Counsel for the\n parties. In the first place, it\n must be borne in mind that\n only an interim order is\n under challenge before us\n and ordinarily no\n interference should be\n made in such a proceeding\n under \nArticle 136\n of the\n Constitution. On merits\n too, we are of the opinion\n that in the light of the\n valuation report by\n Rajendra Arya and the fact\n that the rent of the premises\n was fixed at Rs. 600/- per\n month almost 18 years ago,\n interim mesne profit at the\n rate of Rs. 4,000/- per\n\n68 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed\n\n by NAVJEET\n\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n 2023.10.09\n 15:52:23 +0530\n month cannot be said to be\n excessive. We also see\n from a bare reading of the\n record that the appellant\n has managed to delay the\n eviction proceedings for\n more than 15 years by\n resorting to tactics which\n are clearly unacceptable.\n\n The submission of the\n learned Counsel for the\n appellant that though the\n appellant had indeed been\n transferred from Alwar, yet\n his wife and young son\n often used the premises, is\n again unacceptable. We\n find it difficult to believe\n that a mere Clerk, such as\n the appellant, would be\n able to justify the\n maintenance of two houses,\n one at Alwar and the other\n at his place of posting 400\n kms. Away. \"\n\nCrux- In the aforesaid case, the Supreme Court had appreciated\nthat where the rent of the premises at one point of time was fixed\nat Rs.600/- per month 18 years ago, interim mesne profits at the\nrate of Rs.4000/- per month cannot be said to be excessive. The\ncourt also found that the appellant \nin that case\n had managed to\ndelay the eviction proceedings for more than 15 years by\nresorting to tactics which are clearly unacceptable.\n\n2. \nUnited Bank of India Vs. Smt. Shakuntala Yadav\n, date of\ndecision 04.01.2012, High Court of Delhi:\n\n \"3. The premises in\n question in the present case\n are ground floor and first\n floor of the premises\n bearing no.

Before the Trial Court,\n the respondent/landlord led\n evidence in the form of a\n lease deed executed\n between Bank of Baroda\n and its landlord with\n respect to a premises No. 9,\n LSC Kirti Nagar, Delhi, i.e.\n in around the same area\n where the tenanted\n premises are located. The\n tenanted premises as also\n the premises which were\n the subject matter of the\n lease deed of Bank of\n Baroda with its landlord,\n Ex.PW2/3 were thus both\n situated in the same Kirti\n Nagar Area. Whereas the\n premises of the respondent\n is on the main road, the\n premises taken by Bank of\n Baroda under the lease\n deed dated Ex.PW2/3 is\n admittedly not on the main\n road. Mesne profits in this\n case have to be calculated\n from 1.10.1997 to\n 31.12.2003 and therefore,\n for determining the mesne\n profits, what are the mesne\n profits which would be\n prevalent in around\n October, 1997 would be an\n issue. The lease deed\n Ex.PW2/3 is of the year\n 1995, i.e. about 2 years\n prior to the period\n commencing from which\n the mesne profits have to\n be calculated.\n\n \n5.

In every case\n of determination of mesne\n profits, some amount of\n honest guess work is\n always involved.\n\n Obviously, there cannot be\n complete exactness of\n evidence led with respect to\n rate of rents/mesne profits,\n and the Courts have to\n make a best judgment\n assessment on the basis of\n the evidence which is led\n before it. I have already\n stated above that the suit\n premises are situated on the\n main road, and surely,\n premises on the main road\n have far higher rents than\n premises located in the\n interiors.\n\n 6. I therefore do not feel\n that the Trial Court has\n committed any illegality or\n perversity in granting\n mesne profits at Rs.25/- per\n square feet and therefore\n there is no ground for\n interference in this appeal\n so far as the awarding of\n the rate of mesne profits\n are concerned. In fact I find\n that the Trial Court has\n been more than liberal to\n the appellant/bank\n inasmuch as the rate of\n mesne profits should\n ordinarily undergo an\n increase each year,\n however, the rate of mesne\n profits which has been\n granted continues to be for\n a fixed amount for the\n entire period from\n 1.10.1997 to 31.12.2003,\n i.e. a period of about 6\n years.\n\n \n7.

I may\n note that the suit has been\n filed on 20th October, 1997\n and therefore there would\n hardly be any mesne profits\n which would be payable\n with respect to the pre suit\n period. The mesne profits\n have only accumulated\n pendent lite and till\n 31.12.2003 when the\n premises were vacated.\n\n Therefore it cannot be said\n that interest at 9% per\n annum can be granted on\n the total amount of the\n money decree on mesne\n profits from the date of\n filing of the suit.\n\n Obviously, interest has to\n be calculated only from the\n end of the month for which\n the mesne profits became\n payable. Learned counsel\n for the respondent could\n not very seriously dispute\n this illegal position. I\n therefore clarify the\n impugned judgment by\n observing that when the\n Trial Court has granted\n interest at 9% per annum\n pendent lite and future,\n interest will only be\n calculated from the end of\n the month from which the\n mesne profits would be\n payable, and it will not be\n that interest will be paid\n from the date of filing of\n the suit on the total amount\n of mesne profits decreed. \"\n\nCrux- The premises in this case was ground floor and first floor\nof Kirti Nagar, Delhi and the area was 2866 sq ft.

The\npremises was found to be situated on the main road and it was\nheld that premises on the main road have far higher rents than\npremises located in the interiors. The trial court granted fixed\namount for the entire period but the High Court observed that\nrate of mesne profits should ordinarily undergo an increase each\nyear. The High Court also upheld the interest of 9% per annum\nfrom the end of the month for which mesne profit became\npayable and also clarified that it will not be that interest will be\npaid from the date of filing of the suit on the total amount of\nmesne profits decreed.\n\n3. \nAmresh Bajaj Vs.

In my opinion,\n considering that the\n premises are situated in one\n of the most centrally\n located commercial\n localities of Delhi, situated\n in Connaught Place, an\n increase of 15% every year\n should be awarded (and\n nothing has otherwise been\n shown to me for the\n increase to be lesser)\n during the period for which\n the tenants have over\n stayed in the tenanted\n premises. Putting it\n differently, for the first year\n of illegal occupation, the\n tenant will pay 15%\n increased rent over the\n contractual rent. For the\n second year of illegal\n occupation, 15% increase\n will be over the original\n contractual rent plus the\n additional 15%. It will be\n accordingly for all\n subsequent years of the\n illegal occupation till the\n premises were vacated on\n 3.4.2005.\n \nI rely upon and\n refer to a Division Bench\n judgment of this Court in\n the case of \nS.

It is seen in the facts of\n the present case that the\n respondent/defendant has\n already given benefit to the\n appellant/plaintiff of\n enhanced rent/mesne\n profits by increasing the\n rent at 15% after three\n years, however, in terms of\n the ratio of the judgment in\n the case of M/s \nM.C.\n Aggrawal\n (supra), increase\n would have to be taken per\n year. In my opinion in the\n facts of this case increase\n be granted yearly with 10%\n increase every year and not\n 15% every year or three\n years as per lease deeds of\n respondent/defendant\n noting that inasmuch as\n both the parties have not\n given exact evidence for\n exact rate of rent in the\n same building where the\n suit premises are situated.\n \nI\n am specifically not\n granting 15% annually\n compounded increase in\n terms of M/s \nM.C.\n Aggrawal\n (supra) because\n even between the same\n parties as per the admitted\n lease deed the enhanced\n rental was at 15% increase\n every three years and even\n in the lease deed\n Ex.DW1/1 proved by the\n respondent/defendant the\n increase is at 15% every\n two years.\n Therefore the\n\n75 Chitra Garg Vs.

S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n demised premises is\n situated in one of the prime\n residential localities in\n Delhi, i.e., Greater Kailash-\n\n I, this Court is of the\n opinion that it would be\n just, fit and proper if an\n increase of 15% per annum\n over and above the\n contractual rent be awarded\n to the plaintiff for the first\n year commencing w.e.f.\n\n 01.10.2011 till 30.09.2012.\n\n For the second year of\n illegal occupation, i.e.,\n w.e.f. 01.10.2012 onwards,\n the defendant is held liable\n to pay an increase of 15%\n per annum, over and above\n the original contractual rent\n plus an additional 15% rent\n that has been found to be\n payable for the first year.\n\n Same would remain the\n standard of calculating\n mesne profits for the\n subsequent period, till the\n demised premises is\n vacated by the defendant\n and possession handed over\n to the plaintiff.\n\n 23. As regards the claim of\n interest, the plaintiff has\n sought payment of interest\n calculated @ 18 % per\n annum on the awarded\n amount. However, given\n the facts and circumstances\n of the present case, the\n Court is not inclined to\n award interest at the rate as\n claimed by the plaintiff.\n\n \nInstead, it is deemed\n appropriate to award\n simple interest @ 10 % per\n annum on the aforesaid\n amount for the period of\n default/delay in making\n payment of rent/occupation\n charges, till realization. \nThe\n\n82 Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n said interest shall be\n calculated on the\n outstanding rent on a\n monthly basis, reckoned at\n the end of each month.

State Bank of India\n,\ndate of decision 20.10.2022, Delhi High Court\n \"33. At this stage, it is\n deemed appropriate to refer\n to the term mesne profits as\n defined in \nSection 2 (12)\n of\n the Code of Civil\n Procedure, 1908 (\nCPC\n):\n\n \"2(12) \"mesne profits\" of\n property means those\n profits which the person in\n wrongful possession of\n\n83 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n such property actually\n received or might with\n ordinary diligence have\n received therefrom,\n together with interest on\n such profits, but shall not\n include profits due to\n improvements made by the\n person in wrongful\n possession;\"\n\n \n34. The Supreme Court in\n the judgment of \nLucy\n Kochuvareed v. P.\n Mariappa Gounder & Ors.\n,\n (1979) 3 SCC 150, has\n discussed the principles\n with regard to awarding\n mesne profits. The relevant\n observations are set out\n below:\n\n \"25. Mesne profits being in\n the nature of damages, no\n invariable rule governing\n their award and assessment\n in every Signature Not\n Verified case, can be laid\n down and \"the Court may\n mould to the justice of the\n case\". Even so, one broad\n basic principle governing\n the liability for mesne\n profits is discernible from\n \nSection 2(12)\n of the CPC\n which defines 'mesne\n profits' to mean \"those\n profits which the person in\n wrongful possession of\n property actually received\n or might with ordinary\n diligence have received\n therefrom together with\n interest on such profits, but\n shall not include profits due\n to improvements made by\n the person in wrongful\n possession\". From a plain\n reading of this definition, it\n is clear that wrongful\n possession of the defendant\n is the very essence of a\n\n84 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n claim for mesne profits and\n the very foundation of the\n defendant's liability\n therefore. As a rule,\n therefore, liability to pay\n mesne profits goes with\n actual possession of the\n land. That is to say,\n generally, the person in\n wrongful possession and\n enjoyment of the\n immovable property is\n liable for mesne profits.\"\n\n \n35. Similarly, the Division\n Bench of this Court in\n \nPhiraya Lal Alias Piara Lal\n & Anr. v. Jia Rani & Anr.\n,\n AIR 1973 Del 186, has\n observed as under:\n\n \"14. The claim in the suit\n by Jia Rani against the\n appellants was firstly for\n possession and secondly\n for damage's for use and\n occupation of the site in\n suit wrongfully by the\n defendants appellants.\n\n \nWhen damages are claimed\n in respect of wrongful\n occupation of immovable\n property on the basis of the\n loss caused by the wrongful\n possession of the trespasser\n to the person entitled to the\n possession of the\n immovable property, these\n damages are called \"mesne\n profits\". The measure of\n mesne profits according to\n the definition in \nsection\n 2(12)\n of the Code of Civil\n Procedure is \"those profits\n which the person in\n wrongful possession of\n such property actually\n received or might with\n ordinary diligence have\n received there from,\n together with interest on\n such profits\". It is to be\n\n85 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n noted that though mesne\n profits are awarded because\n the rightful claimant is\n excluded from possession\n of immovable property by a\n trespasser, it is not what the\n original claimant loses by\n such exclusion but what the\n person in wrongful\n possession gets or ought to\n have got out of the property\n which is the measure of\n calculation of the mesne\n profits. (Rattan Lal v.\n\n Girdhari Lal, Air 1972\n Delhi 11). This basis of\n damages for use and\n occupation of immovable\n property which are\n equivalent to mesne profits\n is different from that of\n damages for tort or breach\n of contract unconnected\n with possession of\n immovable property.\n\n \nSection 2(12)\n and \nOrder\n XX Rule 12 of the Code of\n Civil Procedure\n apply only\n to the claims in respect of\n mesne profits but not to\n claims for damages not\n connected with wrongful\n occupation of immovable\n property.\"\n\n 36. In various judgments\n with regard to\n determination of mesne\n profits/damages, this Court\n has held that in residential\n and commercial areas in\n prime and centrally located\n locations, an enhancement\n of stated rent @ 15% every\n year would be justified.\n\n \nReliance in this regard is\n placed on the judgments of\n this court in \nSneh Vaish &\n Anr. v. State Bank of\n Patiala\n, 182 (2012) DLT\n 153; M.C. Agrawal and\n\n86 Chitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors CS DJ no.211236/2016\n \nOrs. v.

VXL Lodging\n N. Boarding Services Pvt\n.\n\n Ltd., 197 (2013) DLT 266,\n a Co-ordinate Bench of this\n Court relying upon the\n earlier judgments has\n observed that while\n calculating mesne profits,\n certain amount of guess\n work by the Court is\n inevitable and acceptable.\n\n Further, the judicial notice\n of increase of rents in\n urban areas can be taken\n note of by the Courts by\n applying provisions of\n \nSection 57\n and \n114\n of the\n Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n\n Applying the aforesaid\n principles, 15%\n enhancement over the\n original lease rent was\n ordered as mesne profits.\n\n The relevant observations\n are set out below:\n\n \"21. The essence of the\n aforesaid decisions of the\n Supreme Court and this\n Court is that judicial notice\n of the increase of rents in\n urban areas can be taken\n note of by courts by\n applying the provisions of\n \nSections 57\n and \n114\n of the\n Evidence Act, 1872 and\n while calculating the mesne\n profits, certain amount of\n guess work by the court, is\n inevitable and acceptable.\n\n 22. \nIn the present case,\n considering the fact that the\n demised premises is\n situated in one of the prime\n\n87 \nChitra Garg Vs.

It\n is true that in the plaint the\n plaintiff claimed damages\n @ Rs. 10,000/- per month\n upto the date of filing of\n the suit.

Delhi Properties\n, 10\nJanuary, 2011, Delhi High Court, wherein it was concluded\nthat when the rate in the year 1980 was Rs. 10,952 then surely\nafter 10 years the plaintiff was justified in claiming rent of Rs.\n41,070 per month.\n\nlxix. The exposition of the aforenoted case laws is that in\ncase there is no or sketchy evidence produced on record to\nestablish the rate for the period for which the mesne profits are\nbeing claimed, the court has to brought in some honest guess\nwork and fix the base price for the year from which the mesne\nprofits are being claimed.

I shall also furnish my reasons to rebuff the\ncomputation done on behalf of the plaintiff in the affidavit of the\nPW1. But before I venture into that, some part of questioning and\nresponse of PW1 in relation to computation of mesne profits are\nextracted herein below.\n\nlxx. PW1 affirmed in his cross-examination that rent\ndeeds placed on record were only from the year 2012-13 and not\nprior to that. He also acknowledged that at least 10 properties of\nwhich the certified copies of the lease agreements have been filed\nare the properties in the main Greater Kailash Part I, M Block\nMarket pertain to the commercial properties. He also fessed up\nduring further questioning that some of the other leases filed by\nhim of Greater Kailash Part I, B Block, main road properties\nhave been in use for approved commercial purpose and the same\nhas been the situation with some of the other leases pertaining to\nGreater Kailash Part I, M Block. PW1 also acknowledged that 35\nproperties of which the lease deeds have been filed are retail\nshops and rest of them are either banks or guest house. In regard\nto a specific query as to when the lease deeds filed by PW1\npertain to 2013-14 onwards, would it be correct to say that there\nare no comparable rent deeds available for the year 1992-93 upon\nwhich PW1 responded that comparison can be made on the basis\nof 'base point' and thereby prevailing rent can be calculated.\nPW1 then referred to annexure G which was given Mark X to\ncompare the prevailing rent in the year 1992 with the prevailing\n94 \nChitra Garg Vs.

Upon further questioning from PW1 as to his\nqualification and competency for carrying out mesne profits\ncomputation for the suit property, he responded that mesne\nprofits were calculated by him on the basis of his own search and\nwith the help of his well wishers.\n\nlxxii. Further cross-examination of PW1 on the aspect of\ncomputation of mesne profits is reproduced below:\n\n \"Q-2 You have clarified\n that the computation is\n correct, please clarify the\n method adopted?\n\n Ans I have deposed three\n methods for computation of\n mesne profits, one on the\n prevailing rent basis,\n second on the basis of\n Delhi Government\n notification concerning\n land circle rates and third\n by way of placing certified\n copies of Lease Deeds of\n the properties, situated\n around suit property.\n\n Q-3 Is it fair to say that the\n Suit property was\n acquired/purchased by\n Plaintiff in 1992-93?\n\n Ans I may not deny, it is\n matter of record.\n\n Q-4 Please clarify that the\n rent prior to the purchase of\n this property by Plaintiff,\n its rent was Rs 1800 per\n month, what you have to\n say?\n\n Ans It is a matter of record.\n\n \nQ-5 Is it correct that the\n rental per month you\n assumed in your\n calculation of mesne profit\n95 \nChitra Garg Vs.

Now I canvass the reasons for not accepting the\ncomputation given by PW1. The first reason is that PW1, being\nthe special power of attorney holder of the plaintiff, was\npermitted only to mark the documents and the lease deeds as\nexemplars for fixing the mesne profits. In the absence of PW1\nhaving any personal knowledge of the acts/transactions in\nrelation to the suit property, its description and location, its rental\nin 1971, his testimony in the affidavit Ex.PW1/A to this effect is\ndisregarded. The second reason is that the plaintiff has arrived at\na figure of Rs 3,85,798 per annum as per Annexure F as mesne\nprofits for the year 1993 on the basis of annual escalation of 14%\nper annum since the year 1971 when the rental was Rs.1800/- per\nmonth, however, it is an admitted case of the plaintiff that till\n1977, the rental in respect of the suit property remained\nRs.1800/- per month and at that time, the suit property was also\n\n97 \nChitra Garg Vs.

The third reason is that from 1977\nonwards till 1993, the plaintiff has failed to produce on record\nany comparables which could facilitate the court to arrive at a\nparticular figure in respect of the mesne profits starting from the\nyear 1993. Rather from 1993 till 2013 also, there is no material\non behalf of the plaintiff which could convince the court in\naccepting the computation placed on record by PW1.\n\nlxxiv.

As we have seen above that there is hardly any lease\ndeed which can be said to be similarly placed as the suit property\nexcept Ex.PW2/16, which is close on the parameter of\nmeasurement being 2471 sqft. The words 'similarly placed'\nencompasses within its ambit similar or nearly similar in area,\nlocation, age of property, availability of amenities. \nThe lease\ndeeds mainly pertain to the shops/commercial properties situated\nprimarily in commercial areas whereas in the case in hand, the\nsuit property is admittedly a residential property, though,\n\n100 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:55:55 +0530\n defendant no.2 had been running a kindergarten school which can\nbe equated with a commercial activity. But rentals in respect of\ncommercial shops cannot be equated with the rentals in respect\nof the residential areas, and therefore, all those lease deeds are of\nlittle to no assistance to the plaintiff. The court is, thus, left with\nno option but to take the judicial notice for fixing the mesne\nprofits in respect of the suit property from the date of the\ninstitution of the suit in November 1993 till February 2020 when\nthe suit property was handed over to the plaintiff.\n\nlxxvi. After meditating over the entire material available\non record in the form of an admitted position that in the year\n1971, the admitted rate of rent was Rs.1800/- per month or 0.62\nper sq feet considering the size of suit property to be 2862 sq ft,\nfor the entire suit property and the same rent was carried forward\ntill 1977 when the lease was extended by the colonel in favor of\nthe Pires School and also considering the rate of rentals found to\nbe existing between 1992 to 95 as per the lease deeds Mark A3,\nsome guess work has to be brought into to fix the quantum of\nthe mesne profits found to be appropriate in respect of the suit\nproperty at the time of institution of the suit. If we take average\nof the rentals as per the lease agreements Mark A3 and honest\nguess work, the same comes out to be around Rs.8000/- per\nmonth for each floor and since the suit property comprises of 2 ¼\nfloors, I am of the opinion that Rs.18000/-, which comes to Rs\n6.28 per sq ft, can be fixed as the base rate for calculating the\nmesne profits in respect of the suit property from the date of the\ninstitution of the suit. \nIn 22 years from 1971, when the rate per sq\nft. was agreed to be 0.6 per sq ft., this much appreciation can be\n101 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:56:03 +0530\n said to be reasonable.\n\nlxxvii. Having arrived at a base figure of Rs 18,000 per\nmonth from the month of November, 1993, the next task is to\ncompute the total quantum of mesne profits till 24.02.2020 when\nthe suit property was handed over to the plaintiff. It certainly is a\ncumbersome and tedious task to assess the mesne profits as there\nare number of factors which would govern the annual escalation\ni.e the age of the property, location, overall quality of\nconstruction, the wear and tear suffered by the property, the\nrepair and renovation work carried out etc. There is no material\nto assess on these parameters as to what was the state of the suit\nproperty between the year 1971 to 1993. Rather from 1992\nonwards till the time of handing over the possession of the suit\nproperty in the year 2020 also, there is no enough material to\nassess the quantum of mesne profits keeping the aforesaid\nparameters in mind. Though DW1 sought to put forth that all\nthese years plaintiff has not spent any amount towards the\nupkeep of suit property and it is the defendant no.2 who had\nspent from her own pocket, but this contention is worth repelling\nhere as it was defendant no. 2 who kept on holding on to the suit\nproperty on the pretext of being its owner. She ought to have\nsurrendered the property as soon as the suit was filed. Having\nfailed to do so, she cannot be heard to complain about spending\non the maintenance of the suit property. Thus, the court has to\nresort to honest guess work to quantify the mesne profits and for\nthis, the aforementioned case laws and its crux are being referred\nto.\n\n102 \nChitra Garg Vs.

On the aspect of annual escalation, Ld. counsel for\ndefendant no.2 argued with much alacrity that 15% annual\nincrease is not considered by the court for the residential\nproperty and therefore the judgment in M C Aggarwal is not\napplicable to the suit property which is residential premises.\n \nLd.\ncounsel for defendant no.2 in this regard, relied upon the\njudgments i.e. (I) M/s \nMarudhar Services Ltd and Anr Vs.

In so far as annual escalation is concerned, we have\nalready seen in most of the judgments noted herein above that the\ncourts have been inclined to grant 10-15% annual escalation in\nthe rate of rent for every consecutive year for which the property\nis retained in unlawful possession by the tenant/trespasser. In\norder to bolster this principle of annual escalation, I reiterate the\njudgment of High Court of Delhi in Chander Kirti Ranji\nTandon Vs.

The court\nconcluded that since the demised premises was situated in one of\nthe prime residential locality in Delhi i.e. Greater Kailash I, it\nwould be just and proper if an increase of 15% per annum over\nand above the contractual rate be awarded along with simple\ninterest @10% per annum to be calculated on the monthly basis.\n\nlxxxii. Also, in \nAnil Kumar Khanna Vs. Indian Tourism\nDevelopment Corporation, July\n 17, 2015, Delhi High Court,\nheld as under:\n\n \"69. In my opinion, in the\n light of the above position\n there is no merit in the\n contentions of the\n defendant. The question of\n fixing the mesne profits @\n Rs.345/- per month as\n sought to be argued is a\n completely misplaced\n argument and has to be\n rejected outright. The suit\n property is three side open\n premises on the ground\n floor abutting on the\n common corridor in\n Connaught Place, New\n Delhi i.e. a prime and\n prestigious commercial hub\n of Delhi. The submission of\n the learned senior counsel\n for the defendant cannot be\n accepted.\n\n Reference may be had to\n the judgment of this Court\n in the case of Roshan Lal\n Vegetable Products Pvt.Ltd.\n\n vs. Param International and\n Anr.(2011) ILR 2Delhi 350\n this Court in paragraphs 11\n and 12 held as follows:-\n\n \n\"11.

In my opinion, the\n conclusions are correct.\n\n PW4, the partner of Empire\n Store in his cross-\n\n examination states that he\n is not aware of the area\n with Bata India Ltd. He is\n also not aware of whether a\n lease deed was executed in\n favour of Bata India Ltd.\n No lease deed has been\n produced. There is nothing\n to show what were the\n terms and conditions\n agreed upon. Hence, the\n conclusion of the Local\n Commissioner in not\n accepting the said\n documents are in order. The\n claim of the plaintiff on\n these documents i.e.\n Rs.41.97 per sq. ft. per\n month for 1979 cannot be\n accepted.\n\n ......\n\n 73. It is also clear that\n determining the mesne\n profit/market rent for a\n period of nearly 27 years\n i.e. 1.2.1980 to 28.2.2007\n cannot be done on the basis\n of two sporadic leases of\n two separate properties\n filed by the plaintiffs dated\n 5.6.1997 and 24.10.2005.\n There is also no evidence\n to show that the leases\n pertained to properties that\n had identical features as the\n suit properties. The\n evidence placed on record\n by the plaintiffs is sketchy\n and based on these sporadic\n leases for a huge area like\n Connaught Place it would\n not have been appropriate\n or proper to conclude the\n market rent for a long\n period of 27 years.\n\n \n74. The approach of the\n\n107 \nChitra Garg Vs.

It cannot be\n forgotten that as per the\n preliminary decree passed\n by this Court the initial rent\n had been agreed to be\n Rs.30,000/- per month for\n the period 1st January,\n 1980 to 31st January, 1980\n i.e. one month. This rate\n was never challenged by\n the defendant before the\n Division Bench or the\n Supreme Court. In fact in\n an undertaking filed before\n the Supreme Court the\n defendant had agreed to\n pay the plaintiff at this rate\n till determination of the\n mesne profits by the Local\n Commissioner. The Local\n Commissioner rightly took\n this figure, namely, 9.37\n per sq.feet to be the base\n rate for 1980. The Local\n Commissioner also relied\n on leases produced before\n this court in various\n judicial pronouncement to\n conclude that the base rate\n of Rs.9.37 per sq.ft. is in\n order.\n \nThe enhancement of\n the said rate by 15% every\n year is also as per various\n judgments of this court i.e.\n \nSneh Vaish & Anr. vs. State\n Bank of Patiala\n, 189(2012)\n DLT 153; \nChander Kirti\n Rani Tandon vs. M.s.VXL\n Lodging N.Boarding\n Services Pvt.

I also cannot help\n noticing that in 1997 based\n on the lease dated 5.6.1997\n the plaintiffs claimed\n mesne profits at Rs.272.90\n sq.ft. per month. The Local\n Commissioner has awarded\n Rs.116.015 per sq. ft per\n month. Similarly, for the\n period 2005 based on the\n lease deed dated\n 24.10.2005 the plaintiffs\n claimed a rent of Rs.454.32\n per sq. ft per month. The\n Local Commissioner has\n awarded Rs.354.895 per sq.\n ft per month. Keeping in\n view the findings of the\n Local Commissioner and\n the nature of evidence\n placed on record by the\n plaintiffs I see no reason to\n differ with the findings of\n the Local Commissioner\n and accept the rates on\n which mesne profits have\n been determined. The rate\n of mesne profits adopted by\n the Local Commissioner in\n the facts and circumstances\n is in order.\n\n \n76. Coming to the interest\n part, the Local\n Commissioner has awarded\n based on judicial\n pronouncements 12% per\n annum from the end of\n each month of illegal\n occupation till 28.2.2007.\n Keeping in view the market\n rate I reduce the interest\n awarded to 8% per annum\n Simple Interest from the\n\n109 \nChitra Garg Vs.

Thus, in the aforesaid case laws also the property\nwas found to be situated in prime location and a distinction was\nalso drawn between the properties which are commercial in\nnature and residential properties which are at prime location\nwould fall in one bracket, and thus, in both the aforesaid cases,\n15% annual escalation was found to be justified.\n\nlxxxiv. The question which now looms large is whether the\npresent case is such which would call for the application of 15%\nannual escalation in the base price of Rs.18000/- from November\n1993 onwards till 24.02.2020. On perusal of various lease deeds\nplaced on record on behalf of the plaintiff, it is made out that in\n\n111 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n some cases the escalation in rent is prescribed every second year,\nin some cases after three years @10-15% per annum, depending\nupon the rate of rental, the location of property and other suitable\nparameters. It is also seen that in case of residential properties,\nthe escalation generally hovers around 10% per annum. The\npresent is a case where the court is tasked to calculate the mesne\nprofits from the year 1993 till 2020 and in between this time\nmany significant developments in terms of economy and real\nestate have taken place. The economy started opening up in the\nearly 1990 and the real estate flourished around early 2000,\nfollowed by recession. The Courts also observed that though the\nthird quarter of 20th century saw a very slow but steady increase\nin prices of immovable property but a drastic change occurred\nfrom the beginning of the last quarter and a galloping increase in\nprices of immovable properties had taken place with prices\nincreasing steeply, by leaps and bounds and judicial notice can be\ntaken thereof. Factoring in all these developments would involve\na lot of guess work in calculating in the mesne profits, which can\nbe avoided by adopting an annual figure of escalation ranging\nbetween 10% to 15%. The fact that it is an admitted position that\ndespite the suit property being residential in nature, was being\nused for running a kindergarten school which to some extent\nwould qualify to commercial activity and defendant no.2 having\nnot disclosed the profits generated while being in wrongful\npossession of suit property, I am of the view that 12% annual\nescalation in the base price of Rs.18,000/- would be just and\nproper in the facts of the present case.\n \nThus, taking cue from the\naforesaid case laws, which had also discussed other significant\ncase laws pertaining to the calculation of the mesne profits, the\n112 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n present case also calls for granting annual escalation of 12% on\nthe aforesaid fix base amount of Rs.18000/- per month in respect\nof the suit property starting from November 1993 (the date of\ninstitution of the suit being 10.11.1993) onwards, till February\n2020 (the handing over of the suit property being 24.02.2020).\n\nlxxxv. I would now delve into the Judgments relied by Ld.\nCounsel for defendant no. 2 on the aspect of grant of\ndamages/mesne profits. Since this is the most crucial aspect of\nthe case, I am stimulated to hash out each Judgment.\n\nlxxxvi. \nIn \nFateh Chand v. Balkishan Dass\n, [1964] 1 SCR\n515, and Bureau of Indian Standards v. M/s Goodwill\nTheatres Pvt. Ltd, Civil Appeal No. 8738 of 2017, Supreme\nCourt of India, the principle for the grant of mesne profits was\ncited, and there is thus no divergence from that. The computation\nof mesne profits arrived in this case is in accord with the\nprinciple of annual escalation as approved in number of case\nlaws exposited above where the evidence is scanty and the Court\nhas to resort to some honest guess work. A person in wrongful\npossession of immovable property has to pay compensation\ncomputed on the basis of profits he actually received or with\nordinary diligence might have received. Further\n, \nin that case\n the\ntransaction was in the nature of sale and purchase of the property,\nwhich is not the case herein. The other Judgments are quite\ncategorical that in case of unauthorized possession of property, in\nthe absence of any evidence, annual escalation to the tune of 10-\n15 percent can be awarded.\n\n113 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n NAVJEET Digitally signed by NAVJEET\n BUDHIRAJA\n\n BUDHIRAJA Date:\n\n +0530\n 2023.10.09 15:58:48\n lxxxvii. \nIn \nMartin and Harris Ltd v. Rajendra Mehta\n,\n2022 8 SCC 527 and VC Jain v. Radha Kishan Poddar, 2021\nSCC Online Del 4386 again the Court reiterated that the basis of\ndetermination of the amount of mesne profits depends on the\nfacts and circumstances of each case considering the place where\nproperty is situated along with other parameters. In that case,\nconsidering the location, the Supreme Court upheld that mesne\nprofits of Rs2,50,000 per month. In this case also, the location of\nthe suit property is undoubtedly prime and, thus, the mesne\nprofits assessed are in sync with that, else annual escalation of 12\npercent per annum would not have been given.\n\nlxxxviii. In State of Maharashtra v. SuperMax\nInternational Pvt. Ltd, 2009 9 SCC 772, the Courts are called\nupon to exercise restraint and would not fix any excessive,\nfanciful and punitive amount. Despite the dictums favoring grant\nof 15 percent annual escalation, I have avoided such outer limit\nand reduced it to 12 percent per annum, which cannot be termed\nas fanciful.\n\nlxxxix. \nIn \nAlka Sachdeva v. Neeraj Gupta and Others\n,\n2021 SCC Online Del 5536, the Court took note of the\ndilapidated condition of the property and the lease deeds of the\nneighbouring area, which is done in this case also as I have given\nan average figure of base value of mesne profits in the year 1993\non the basis of the lease deeds of the corresponding period placed\non behalf of defendant no. 2 only.\n\nxc. \nIn \nMarudhar Services v. Ved Prakash and Other\n, 2012\n\n114 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n SCC Online Del 4232, the court appreciated that in case of\ncommercial property the annual escalation can be 15 percent\nwhich can be reduced to 10 percent in residential property.\n\nKeeping this in mind, escalation of 15 percent was declined, but\nconsidering the dictum in the case of \nAnil Kumar\n case and\nChander kirti \nRani Tandon\n case mentioned above that in\ncommercial properties and residential properties at prime\nlocations, 15 percent escalation is permitted, I have deemed it fit\nto award 12 percent annual escalation given the fact that suit\nproperty is situated in one of the prime locations of South Delhi\ni.e Greater Kailash on a wide road.\n\nxci. \nIn \nHindustan Paper Corporation v. Kanta\nManocha\n, 2013 SCC Online Del 4232, the Court had spoken\nabout 10-15 percent increase every three years, but this can be\none off case as we have seen in numerous cases above that\nescalation is being given on yearly basis.\n\nxcii. Further, a pleading of mis-joinder of parties and the\nsuit being barred by limitation were also raised in the written\nstatement, however, there is no evidence to substantiate these\npleadings. The cause of action in regard to the claim of mesne\nprofits is a continuing one and in this case since the suit property\nwas surrendered on behalf of defendant no.2 only on 24.02.2020,\nat no stretch of imagination, the suit cannot be said to be barred\nby limitation.\n\nxciii. Ld. Counsel for Defendant no.2 also elucidated with\nthe help of case laws on the concept that plaintiff has to prove the\n115 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed by\n NAVJEET NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:57:38 +0530\n case on its own merits without deriving any advantage out of the\nweakness of the defendant, but this weakness which Ld. Counsel\nwas referring to was the pleading of the defendant no.2 of having\nbecome owner of the suit property on the back of adverse\npossession. This argument is also nothing but a ploy to save\ndefendant no.2 from being imputed with the liability to\ncompensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered by keeping out of\nthe possession of suit property. The plaintiff has proved her\nentitlement to claim mesne profits the moment defendant no.2\nchose to concede the possession of the suit property in her favour\nwhich also amounted to conceding to the ownership claim of the\nplaintiff.\n\n Issue no.1 is accordingly decided in favour of the\nplaintiff and against defendant no. 2.\n\n42. Issue no.2: Whether the plaintiff is also entitled\nto any interest? OPP\n\ni. The burden to prove this issue was also on the\nplaintiff. Ld. Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, as we have already\nnoted, laid thrust on restitution in favour of the plaintiff and to\nset an example by granting exemplary interest in the form of\ncompound interest rather than simple interest.\n\nii. Ld. counsel for defendant no.2, per contra, stated\nthat the principle of restitution has been invoked for the first time\nat the stage of final arguments which does not find part of the\npleading or the evidence of the plaintiff and in this regard\n116 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:57:46 +0530\n reliance is placed upon the judgment of \nState of Gujarat &\nothers Vs. Essar Oil Limited and another\n, AIR 2012 SC 1146\nwherein it was held as under:\n\n \"....Concept of restitution\n is basically founded on the\n idea that when a decree is\n reversed, law imposes an\n obligation on the party who\n received an unjust benefit\n of the erroneous decree to\n restitute the other party of\n what the other party has\n lost during the period of\n erroneous decree was in\n operation. The Court while\n granting restitution is\n required to restore the\n parties as far as possible to\n their same position as they\n were in at the time when\n the court by its erroneous\n action displaced them....\"\n\niii. Further to counter the judgment of Madras High\nCourt relied on behalf of the plaintiff mentioned in preceding\ndiscussion, Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 canvassed that \nthe\nsaid judgment\n is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of\nthe present case as the facts therein are entirely different and \nthe\nsaid judgment\n cannot be treated to be a precedent applicable to\nthe present case. Ld. counsel for defendant no.2 categorically\ndistinguished \nthe said judgment\n of Madras High Court from the\npresent case on various parameters in the written synopsis.\n\niv. From the expression \"together with interest on such\nprofits\" in \nSection 2(12)\n of CPC, it is apparent that mesne profits\nincludes within its fold an interest component and the rate of\ninterest to be allowed in regard to the mesne profits varies\n\n117 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016\n\n Digitally signed by\n\n NAVJEET NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:57:54 +0530\n depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Since\nthe statute does not fix any rate of interest, it is left at the\ndiscretion of the court to determine the rate of interest.\n \nIn\n\nMahant Narayana Dasjee Vs. Board of Trustees\n, The\nTirumalai 1965 SC 1231, the Supreme Court observed that the\ninterest is integral part of mesne profits, therefore, it is to be\nallowed in the computation of mesne profits itself.\n\nv. In the plaint, the plaintiff has claimed interest @\n19% per annum but no material has been placed on record to\njustify such exorbitant rate of interest, except the oral arguments\nadvanced on behalf of the plaintiff wherein cross examination of\nDW1 was also pointed out particularly from question no.16 to 34\nand question 114 to 120. The interest component also constitutes\na significant fragment of the pleading and evidence, and since in\nthis case the testimony of PW1 can be read only to a limited\nextent, he being the special power of attorney holder of the\nplaintiff, and in the absence of any material in his affidavit to\nsupport the claim of 19% interest, the cross questioning of DW1\non the aspect of rates applicable to the nationalized bank and\nreturns at a particular rate would be of no assistance to the\nplaintiff.\n\nvi. Ld. Counsel for defendant no. 2 also referred to\n\nVinod Kumar and Others v. Bohat Ram and others\n, RFA No.\n221/2018, Delhi High Court and \nRamnik Vallabhdas\nMadhvani v.

On the issue of interest on mesne profits, let me\nspell out the observation of High Court of Delhi in M/s M C\nAgarwala (HUF) Vs. M/s Sahara India and Ors, date of\ndecision 02.09.2011, paragraph 17 of which is relevant and the\nsame is as under:\n\n \"17. In my opinion, the\n interest granted at the rate\n of 20% per month besides\n being wholly vague is\n clearly exorbitant in the\n present economic scenario\n where the rates of interest\n on fixed deposit vary\n between 6% to 10% per\n annum.

In the aforesaid case, the Hon'ble Judge has noted\nthat the interest granted at the rate of 20% per annum was clearly\nvague and exorbitant where the rate of interest on fixed deposit\nvary between 6 to 10% per annum. The Hon'ble Judge has also\nreferred to various other judgments of the Supreme Court to\nhighlight that the courts are mandated to reduce high rate of\ninterest which are claimed.\n\nix.

Defendant no.2, though can be stated to have entered\ninto the suit property being the partner of Pires School but her\npossession became illegal, once she started proclaiming herself\nas owner of the suit property on the basis of adverse possession,\nwhich plea from the very inception was false and vexatious and\nwhich eventually fizzled out when the keys of the suit property\nwas handed over to the plaintiff. But in this long-drawn process,\nthe plaintiff has suffered due to shenanigans of defendant no.2\nwho managed to prolong the litigation for almost three decades.\nWhen the plaintiff had purchased the suit property and became\nits legal owner following which the present suit was filed,\ndefendant no.2 ought to have vacated the suit property in the\nabsence of any legal right to occupy the same but she persisted in\nher illegal quest to usurp the suit property in the garb of plea of\nadverse possession, which constrained the plaintiff to embark on\nthis unwarranted journey, in order to lawful recover the\npossession of the suit property. Therefore, for these special\nreasons, I am of the confirmed opinion that defendant no.2 be\nsaddled with onerous interest at the rate of 9% per annum\n(simple) payable at the end of each month of illegal occupation\nby defendant no.2 starting from the institution of the suit till\nhanding over of the suit property.\n\nx. Though, Ld. Senior counsel for the plaintiff, during\n121 \nChitra Garg Vs. S K Bansal and Ors\n CS DJ no.211236/2016 Digitally signed\n by NAVJEET\n NAVJEET BUDHIRAJA\n BUDHIRAJA Date: 2023.10.09\n 15:59:14 +0530\n\n \narguments, clamored for the grant of compound interest on the\nback of the restitution theory as propounded in the judgments\nreferred by Ld. Senior counsel, however, those judgments are on\ndistinct platform, except the judgment in \nK Pandurangan Vs.\nMrs. C Parimala\n, date of decision 23.12.2021, Madras High\nCourt, but \nin that case\n also, the High Court reduced the\ncompensation as sought by the party from Rs.49 lacs\napproximately to Rs.35 lacs. No doubt, the plaintiff herein is\nentitled to the restitution for the immense loss suffered by her at\nthe hands of the defendant no.2, but in my opinion, ends of\njustice would be met by granting 9% simple interest per annum\nto be calculated at the end of each month when the mesne profits\nfell due.\n\n Issue no.2 is decided in favor of the plaintiff and\nagainst the defendant no.2.\n\n42. In so far as the claim of recovery of Rs.11,66,500/-\non behalf of the plaintiff as damages/mesne profits for the year\n19.02.1992 till 08.02.1993, in view of the jurisprudence of grant\nof mesne profits, the fact that the same can only be awarded from\nthe date of institution of the suit, the arrears with effect from\n19.02.1992 cannot be granted in favour of the plaintiff. It is not\nthe case of the plaintiff that defendant no.2 was a tenant in the\nsuit property who was bound to deposit/pay the arrears of rent.\nTherefore, this claim of the plaintiff cannot be acceded to.\nDecision:\n\n43. The suit of the Plaintiff is decreed against Defendant\nno.2/LRs as per memo of parties as under:\n\n1. Mesne profits @ Rs.18,000/- per month from 10th November\n\n122 Chitra Garg Vs.

Jitender Kaur from whom\nthe plaintiff alleged to have purchased the suit property was not\nthe owner on 19.02.1992 as defendant no.2 had become the\nowner by way of adverse possession. She also pleaded that there\nwas a positive act of ouster on her part and when she asserted\nhostile title and from that time onwards her possession had been\nopen, continuous, hostile, peaceful and uninterrupted and she\nperfected her title over the suit property by way of adverse\npossession even before the execution of the sale deed in favour\nof the plaintiff. It is also noticed that at other stages of written\nstatement also, defendant no.2 tenaciously persisted with the\nclaim of her ownership over the suit property by way of adverse\npossession. But there is nothing in the entire written statement\nthat the defendants were in occupation of the suit property in the\ncapacity of being a partner in Pires School and eventually as a\ntenant. There is no pleading on the part of the defendant no.2 as\nto in what capacity, she came to occupy the suit property. Rather,\nin the written statement, she claimed that the school was being\nrun by her in her own right. Further, all these claims came to\nnaught and drew blank when the possession of the suit property\nwas handed over to the plaintiff, which act clearly debunks and\nbelies the version of defendant no.2 having gained ownership\nover the suit property on the basis of adverse possession.

Motion Pictures\nAssociation\n, 122 (2005) DLT 629 that even if no substantial\nevidence is led by the plaintiff in respect of the rent of the\nproperties, judicial notice can be taken thereof to appreciate the\nrate of rent and fix the quantum thereto. This would also\nsomehow strengthen the argument of Ld. Senior Counsel for the\nplaintiff that the assessment of grant and quantum of the mesne\nprofits is in the realm of being an inquiry and thus, it can be\nsafely concluded that even if there is no evidence led by the\nplaintiff who is claiming his/her entitlement to the grant of the\nmesne profits, the court can take judicial notice of the prevalent\nrate of rent of any particular area and proceed to pass the\nnecessary order. Therefore, the contention of the defendant that\nplaintiff was incumbent upon to enter into the witness box and\nsubject herself to cross examination, does not hold any water.\nThe judgments relied upon in this regard are facts centric and\ncompletely distinguishable as in none of those cases, the\ntestimony of the attorney was limited to the extent of mesne\nprofits."

It certainly is a\ncumbersome and tedious task to assess the mesne profits as there\nare number of factors which would govern the annual escalation\ni.e the age of the property, location, overall quality of\nconstruction, the wear and tear suffered by the property, the\nrepair and renovation work carried out etc. There is no material\nto assess on these parameters as to what was the state of the suit\nproperty between the year 1971 to 1993. Rather from 1992\nonwards till the time of handing over the possession of the suit\nproperty in the year 2020 also, there is no enough material to\nassess the quantum of mesne profits keeping the aforesaid\nparameters in mind. Though DW1 sought to put forth that all\nthese years plaintiff has not spent any amount towards the\nupkeep of suit property and it is the defendant no.2 who had\nspent from her own pocket, but this contention is worth repelling\nhere as it was defendant no. 2 who kept on holding on to the suit\nproperty on the pretext of being its owner.

It is also seen that in case of residential properties,\nthe escalation generally hovers around 10% per annum. The\npresent is a case where the court is tasked to calculate the mesne\nprofits from the year 1993 till 2020 and in between this time\nmany significant developments in terms of economy and real\nestate have taken place. The economy started opening up in the\nearly 1990 and the real estate flourished around early 2000,\nfollowed by recession. The Courts also observed that though the\nthird quarter of 20th century saw a very slow but steady increase\nin prices of immovable property but a drastic change occurred\nfrom the beginning of the last quarter and a galloping increase in\nprices of immovable properties had taken place with prices\nincreasing steeply, by leaps and bounds and judicial notice can be\ntaken thereof. Factoring in all these developments would involve\na lot of guess work in calculating in the mesne profits, which can\nbe avoided by adopting an annual figure of escalation ranging\nbetween 10% to 15%.

This argument is also nothing but a ploy to save\ndefendant no.2 from being imputed with the liability to\ncompensate the plaintiff for the loss suffered by keeping out of\nthe possession of suit property. The plaintiff has proved her\nentitlement to claim mesne profits the moment defendant no.2\nchose to concede the possession of the suit property in her favour\nwhich also amounted to conceding to the ownership claim of the\nplaintiff."

The present case\nis one such case which undoubtedly stands out for the sheer\nabuse of the process of law as a result of which the present\nlitigation remained in the corridors of the court for almost three\ndecades. Defendant no.2, though can be stated to have entered\ninto the suit property being the partner of Pires School but her\npossession became illegal, once she started proclaiming herself\nas owner of the suit property on the basis of adverse possession,\nwhich plea from the very inception was false and vexatious and\nwhich eventually fizzled out when the keys of the suit property\nwas handed over to the plaintiff. But in this long-drawn process,\nthe plaintiff has suffered due to shenanigans of defendant no.2\nwho managed to prolong the litigation for almost three decades.\nWhen the plaintiff had purchased the suit property and became\nits legal owner following which the present suit was filed,\ndefendant no.2 ought to have vacated the suit property in the\nabsence of any legal right to occupy the same but she persisted in\nher illegal quest to usurp the suit property in the garb of plea of\nadverse possession, which constrained the plaintiff to embark on\nthis unwarranted journey, in order to lawful recover the\npossession of the suit property. Therefore, for these special\nreasons, I am of the confirmed opinion that defendant no.2 be\nsaddled with onerous interest at the rate of 9% per annum\n(simple) payable at the end of each month of illegal occupation\nby defendant no.2 starting from the institution of the suit till\nhanding over of the suit property."
