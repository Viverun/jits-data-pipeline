No. 2274 of 2008)\n\nManoj Mahavir Prasad Khaitan ... Appellant\n\n Versus\n\nRam Gopal Poddar & Anr. ... Respondents\n\n J U D G M E N T\n\nV.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\n\n1. Leave granted.\n\n2. This judgment will also dispose of the Transfer\n\nPetition being T.P. (Crl.) No. 259/2008 filed on behalf\n\nof Smt. Rekha Kailash Poddar who is the daughter-in-law\n\nof Ram Gopal Poddar, respondent No. 1 herein.\n\n3. The facts are very peculiar. Smt. Rekha Poddar\n\nwho is the daughter-in-law of the respondent No. 1\n\nherein, is also the sister of the appellant herein.\n\nAfter the marriage allegedly she was harassed by her\n\nin-laws for dowry. She, therefore, proceeded to file a\n\ncomplaint for the offences punishable under \nSections\n\n498A\n, \n406\n of the Indian Penal Code (\nIPC\n) read with\n\n\f 2\n\nSection 4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act against Ram\n\nGopal Poddar, respondent No. 1 herein, who is her\n\nfather-in-law. The respondent No. 1 was arrested for\n\nthose offences on 15.7.2004 and was released on bail on\n\nthe next day i.e. 16.7.2004. In pursuance of this\n\ncomplaint, the police officers from Nerul Police\n\nStation and also from Rajasthan had gone to the\n\nmatrimonial home at Mumbai for investigation, with whom\n\nthe present appellant was also present. The police\n\nconducted a raid at the matrimonial house on 14.7.2004\n\nwhen the appellant herein was also present. They\n\nprobably wanted to seize the passport of the sister of\n\nthe appellant.\n\n4. On 17.7.2004, a written complaint came to be filed\n\nin Nerul Police Station alleging that the appellant had\n\nstolen some gold ornaments during that raid. However,\n\nthe police did not take the cognizance of that\n\ncomplaint. A criminal complaint, therefore, came to be\n\nfiled after about six months i.e. on 17.3.2005 in the\n\nCourt of 1st Class Judicial Magistrate at Vashi for the\n\noffence punishable under \nSection 379\n IPC against the\n\nappellant alone. The cognizance was taken of this\n\n\f 3\n\ncomplaint on 2.4.2005 for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 379\n IPC and process came to be issued.\n\n5. The appellant, therefore, challenged the order\n\nissuing process by way of a Criminal Revision\n\nApplication dated 5.7.2006 before the Sessions Judge at\n\nThane. This Criminal Revision Application, however,\n\nwas withdrawn on 7.5.2007, though the withdrawal\n\napplication was opposed by the complainant-respondent.\n\nAccording to the appellant, this was done without his\n\nknowledge or consent and he had not put his signatures\n\non the withdrawal application. By order dated\n\n7.5.2007, the Sessions Judge permitted withdrawal.\n\n6. The appellant, therefore, moved Bombay High Court\n\nby way of a petition under \nSection 482\n of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code (\nCr.P.C\n.), challenging the whole\n\nproceedings. He also proceeded to file a complaint\n\nagainst his lawyers in the Bar Council of Maharashtra\n\nfor misconduct. The High Court, however, dismissed his\n\npetition holding that the only remedy left for the\n\nappellant was to again go before the Sessions Judge and\n\nget the matter restored. It is this judgment of the\n\nHigh Court which is sought to be challenged before us\n\nby way of the present appeal.\n\n\f 4\n\n7. Indisputably, there was a background against the\n\ncomplaint filed involving the present appellant and\n\nthat was the prosecution by the daughter-in-law of\n\nrespondent No. 1 herein who was also the sister of the\n\nappellant herein. There can be no dispute that in the\n\ncomplaint there were allegations made of the theft of\n\ntwo gold bangles (Patli) weighing about 60 grams. We\n\nhave also seen the verification statement recorded by\n\nRam Gopal Poddar, respondent No. 1, wherein he has\n\nstated that it was the accused (appellant herein) who\n\naccompanied ASI Shri Gupta and Hawaldar Jaiprakash\n\nSingh from Nerul Police Station. It is admitted that\n\nthese police officers and the appellant/accused had\n\ncome to the house of Ram Gopal Poddar, respondent No. 1\n\nin connection with the criminal prosecution instituted\n\nby the daughter-in-law of Ram Gopal Poddar, respondent\n\nNo. 1, who was the sister of the accused/appellant. It\n\nis then stated that the accused/appellant forced ASI\n\nShri Gupta to take search of cupboards for seizing the\n\npassport of Smt. Rekha Poddar, daughter-in-law of\n\nrespondent No. 1. The appellant asked respondent No. 1\n\nfor key of cupboard and opened the cupboard and in the\n\nabsence of Ram Gopal Poddar, respondent No. 1, \"they\"\n\nstole two gold bangles weighing 60 grams. Therefore,\n\n\f 5\n\nit was obvious that the criminal complaint was in\n\nretaliation of the criminal prosecution which was being\n\nfaced by the respondent No. 1 herein. It was on the\n\nbasis of the complaint and the verification statement\n\nof the complainant/respondent No. 1 alone that the\n\nJudicial Magistrate, Vashi took cognizance and issued\n\nsummons.\n\n8. It is undoubtedly true that the appellant herein\n\nchallenged it by way of a criminal revision before the\n\nSessions Judge, Thane and very significantly, the said\n\nrevision came to be withdrawn. There does not appear\n\nto be any reason for such sudden and inexplicable\n\nwithdrawal. We have seen the reply to the revision\n\nfiled by Ram Gopal Poddar, respondent No. 1. From\n\nthere, it becomes apparent that the same role is\n\nascribed and it is admitted therein that the passport\n\nwas seized by the police officer. It is also suggested\n\nthat thereafter, the appellant/accused locked the\n\ncupboard and handed over the keys to the respondent No.\n\n1 who kept the same in his pocket and thereafter, he\n\nwas arrested and taken to Rajasthan. It is then\n\nsuggested that key alongwith other things were handed\n\nover to the lawyer of the respondent No. 1. On this\n\n\f 6\n\nbasis, it is suggested that it was the\n\nappellant/accused alone who had stolen the gold\n\nbangles, which fact probably came to the notice of the\n\nrespondent No. 1 only after coming back to Bombay.\n\n9. The only material on the basis of which the\n\nMagistrate issued the summons was the complaint and the\n\nverification statement. Beyond the allegations which\n\nwe have already mentioned, there are no other\n\nallegations. We feel on the face of it the allegations\n\nwere absurd and without any basis. It is absurd to\n\nthink that the appellant herein who was present with\n\nthe police party (2 in No.) would venture to pocket the\n\nbangles in their presence. Further, admittedly, after\n\nlocking the locker, the keys were handed over to the\n\nrespondent No. 1. Neither is it known nor has it been\n\nmade clear as to when the respondent No. 1 opened the\n\nlocker again to find that the two gold bangles were\n\nstolen. Be that as it may, the very look of the\n\ncomplaint is enough to convince one about the absurdity\n\nof the allegations. When the complaint is seen on the\n\nbackdrop of the prosecution of the respondent No. 1 for\n\noffences under \nSection 498\n IPC and the allied offences,\n\nthe absurdity becomes all the more prominent. Again\n\n\f 7\n\nthere is no complaint against the two accompanying\n\npolice officers. They have not been made accused in\n\nthe complaint. There can be no doubt, therefore, that\n\nthe complaint wholly lacks the bona fides and it was\n\nobviously with the indirect motive for hounding the\n\nappellant who was none else but the brother of the\n\ndaughter-in-law of respondent No. 1 who had started the\n\ncriminal proceedings.\n\n10. The learned Counsel for the appellant is,\n\ntherefore, right in contending that the complaint had\n\nto be quashed, firstly, because it was absurd and\n\nsecondly, because the complainant/respondent No. 1\n\nwholly lack the bona fides in filing such complaint\n\nwhich was absurd. The learned Counsel for the\n\nrespondent No. 1 vehemently argued that at this stage,\n\nwhat was to be seen was only the contents of the\n\ncomplaint and if there appeared the basic contentions\n\nindicating committing of crime by the\n\nappellant/accused, then the Courts would not interfere\n\nwith the same and leave the parties to lead evidence\n\nduring the ensuing trial, relying on the oft-quoted\n\ndecision in \nState of Haryana & Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal &\n\nOrs.\n [1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335]. There can be no dispute\n\n\f 8\n\nabout the law \nlaid down in\n that case.\n However, where\n\non the face of it the absurd charges are levelled and\n\nthere is a whole lack of the bona fides of the\n\ncomplainant/respondent No.1, in our opinion, there\n\nwould be no fetter in using the powers under Section\n\n482 Cr.P.C.\n\n11. It was pointed out that the criminal revision\n\nagainst the issuance of summons was withdrawn. We\n\nwere, therefore, taken to the High Court's judgment,\n\nwhere the High Court has found itself to be powerless\n\nin view of the withdrawal of the criminal revision and\n\nhad advised the parties to go back to the revisional\n\nCourt and get it restored. We do not think that the\n\nHigh Court was justified in advising the appellant to\n\ngo back to the Sessions Judge and to get the criminal\n\nrevision revived without going into the question\n\nwhether such revision could have been revived in law or\n\nnot. We observe that the High Court was not powerless.\n\nThe High Court itself was exercising its jurisdiction\n\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., where the High Court could\n\npass any order in the interests of justice. This power\n\nwas available only to the High Court in\n\ncontradistinction to the Sessions Judge who was only\n\n\f 9\n\nentertaining the revision application of the appellant\n\nunder \nSection 397\n Cr.P.C. The High Court should have,\n\ntherefore, applied its mind to the fact situation. It\n\nshould have been realized that the complaint was wholly\n\ncovered under the 7th circumstance in the case of \nState\n\nof Haryana & Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal & Ors.\n (cited supra),\n\nwhich is as under:-\n\n\"7. Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended\nwith mala fide and/or where the proceeding is\nmaliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for\nwreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to\nspite him due to private and personal grudge.\"\n\n \nIt was also covered under 3rd circumstance in the\n\ncase of \nState of Haryana & Ors. Vs. Bhajan Lal & Ors.\n\n(cited supra), which suggests:-\n\n\"3. Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the\nFIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support\nof the same do not disclose the commission of any\noffence and make out a case against the accused.\"\n\n We reiterate that when the criminal Court looks\n\ninto the complaint, it has to do so with the open mind.\n\nTrue it is that that is not the stage for finding out\n\nthe truth or otherwise in the allegations; but where\n\nthe allegations themselves are so absurd that no\n\nreasonable man would accept the same, the High Court\n\ncould not have thrown its arms in the air and expressed\n\n\f 10\n\nits inability to do anything in the matter. \nSection\n\n482\n Cr.P.C. is a guarantee against injustice. The High\n\nCourt is invested with the tremendous powers thereunder\n\nto pass any order in the interest of justice.\n\nTherefore, this would have been a proper case for the\n\nHigh Court to look into the allegations with the\n\nopenness and then to decide whether to pass any order\n\nin the interests of justice. In our opinion, this was\n\na case where the High Court ought to have used its\n\npowers under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n12. In view of the fact, we ordinarily would have sent\n\nthe matter back to the High Court, but there is no\n\npoint now in remanding the matter back to the High\n\nCourt in view of the pendency of this matter for last\n\nsix years. In that view, we allow this appeal, set\n\naside the order of the High Court and quash the\n\ncriminal proceedings started by the respondent No. 1\n\nvide criminal case No. 194 of 2005.\n\n13. In view of this order, it will not be necessary to\n\npass any order in the transfer petition which seeks the\n\n\f 11\n\ntransfer of the very complaint which we have quashed\n\nherein.\n\n ............................J.\n [V.S.
