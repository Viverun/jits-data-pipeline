Act\n, P.S. Rampur Mathura, District -Sitapur.\n\n3. The FIR in question was lodged alleging that the applicant, who is the mother in law of the victim and is aged about 68 years, the offence in question was lodged alleging that the entire matrimonial family used to demand dowry and on non-payment thereof, the victim was killed and hanged.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the applicant argues that the post-mortem report on record indicates the cause of death as anti-mortem hanging without there being any other injuries depicted over the body in question. It is argued that the applicant is 68 years of age and there is nothing to demonstrate that there was any demand of dowry at the instance of offence in question before the incident or in the close vicinity so as to attract the offence under\nSection 304\nIPC.\n\n5. Learned AGA opposes the bail application by arguing that the offence in question is serious.\n\n6. Considering the submissions made at bar, prima-facie, from the perusal of the post-mortem report, no sign of physical injury was present on the body of the victim, the allegations on record do not demonstrate any demand of dowry at the instance of the applicant before the death or in the close vicinity. The applicant being a lady and has no previous criminal antecedent is entitled to be enlarged on bail.\n\n6. Let the applicantKusuma be released on bail in Case Crime No.0111 of 2023, under\nSection 498A\n,\n304B\nIPC and 3/4 of\nD.P. Act\n, P.S.
