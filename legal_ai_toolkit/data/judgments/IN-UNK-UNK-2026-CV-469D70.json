These two appeals have been preferred by either of the parties\n\nchallenging the judgment and order dated 08.08.2019 passed in SWP No.\n\n371/2018 \"\nMuni Devi V. State of J&K and others\n\".\n\n02. The petitioner-Muni Devi seeking regularization of service as Craft\n\nTeacher was granted the relief of regularization departmentally with effect from\n\n17.08.2017 but in the writ petition, her service has been directed to be\n\nregularized with effect from 27.09.2010. She has preferred the appeal claiming\n\nbenefit of regularization with much anterior date i.e. 01.12.1998.\n\n 2 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\n03. The Union Territory of J&K has preferred the other appeal against the\n\nsame very judgment and order of the writ court contending that the petitioner is\n\nentitled to regularization of service from the date the order of regularization and\n\nnot from any anterior date.\n\n04. The petitioner was initially appointed as craft teacher in the Department\n\nof Social Welfare and was posted at Social Welfare Centre, Batote for a period\n\nof 60 days w.e.f. 27.11.1991 and was thereafter, continued for another spell of\n\n60 days purely on stop-gap arrangement with a break of one day till the\n\nselection was made by the competent authority whichever was earlier, which\n\nwas done by District Development Commissioner, Doda vide his Order No.\n\nDD/91-92/231/B dated 22.01.1992.\n\n05. The petitioner further claims that despite the fact that she had been\n\ncontinuously performing her duties of craft teacher and had completed\n\ncontinuous service for more than 7 years, yet the respondent did not consider\n\nher case for regularization in terms of Government Order No. 1285-GAD of\n\n2001 dated 06.11.2001.\n\n06. In terms of the aforesaid Government order, petitioner claims that she was\n\nentitled to be regularized w.e.f. 27.11.1998 and was kept waiting for\n\nregularization, but no action was taken by the respondents till the State\n\nLegislature enacted an Act known as \nJammu and Kashmir Civil Services\n\n(Special Provisions) Act, 2010\n (hereinafter referred to as „the Act of 2010‟). The\n\npetitioner was ultimately regularized by the respondents vide order No. 260-SW\n\nof 2017 dated 17.08.2017 prospectively, though at the time of promulgation of\n\nthe Act, she had already completed more than seven years continuous service on\n\nad hoc basis and was fulfilling all other requirements of the Act of 2010.\n\n 3 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\n07. Petitioner being aggrieved of the order dated 17.08.2017 passed by the\n\nGovernment, filed the writ petition bearing SWP No. 371/2018 titled as „Smt.\n\nMuni Devi Vs. State of J&K\n and others‟ and has prayed as under:-\n\n \"the writ petition may kindly be allowed by issuing of an\n appropriate writ, direction or order including in the nature of\n writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to regularize the\n services of the petitioner as Craft teacher with effect from\n 01.12.1998 instead of 17.08.2017 by modifying the Govt. Order\n No. 260-SW of 2017 dated 17.08.2017 in terms of SRO 64 of\n 1994 read with Govt. Order No. 1285-GAD of 2001 dated\n 06.11.2001 with all consequential benefits including counting of\n service for pensionary benefits with effect from 27.11.1991,\n arrears of pay scale, revision of pay scale made from time to\n time by the Government, fixation of seniority and further\n promotion to the post of Social Worker (grade-I), alternatively\n writ of mandamus striking down the first proviso of \nSection 5\n of\n the J&K Civil Services (Special Provisions ) Act, 2010 as being\n unconstitutional, illegal and discriminatory.\"\n\n08. The learned writ court held as under:-\n\n \n\"What was held by the Division Bench in the \nRabia Shah Vs.\n State of J&K and others\n judgment is very precisely summed up\n in Paragraph No. 20 of the judgment, which for facility of\n reference is reproduced as under:-\n\n \"20. Now, since the petitioner had completed the\n prescribed seven years' service on ad hoc basis much\n prior to the appointed day, her case for regularization\n would have to be considered immediately, after the\n appointed day in terms of \nSection 10\n of the 2010 Act.\n As held above, the period of accord of such\n consideration could riot be unreasonably stretched\n beyond 75 days to complete the processes under Sub-\n section (2) and (3) m of \nSection 10\n of the 2010 Act6\n and then a maximum of further equal period would be\n required for completion of the remaining part of the\n processes under Sub-sections (4) and (5) of the said\n Section. In that view, the writ petitioner would be\n entitled to regularization from a date, say, at least, 150\n posterior to the appointed day, which would fall\n somewhere towards the end of September, 2010, to be\n precise 26/27.09.2010.\"\n\n 4 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\n 4. For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner is held entitled to\n regularization of her services w.e.f. 27.09.2010 with all\n consequential benefits. The writ petition is, accordingly, allowed\n in the above terms.\"\n\n08. The petitioner herein has challenged the judgment passed by the learned\n\nwrit court on the ground that the claim of the petitioner was not processed\n\nimmediately under the J&K Civil Services (Special Provisions) Act, 2010,\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that the respondents were under statutory obligation to\n\nprocess the case of the petitioner. However, the respondents took 7 years to take\n\na decision with regard to the regularization of the services of the petitioner. The\n\npetitioner has also stated that she was entitled to regularization w.e.f.\n\n01.12.1998 on completion of 7 years of service in terms of SRO 64 of 1994. The\n\npetitioner also is seeking parity as has been given to Sh. Krishan Chand, who\n\nwas appointed on temporary basis vide order dated 20.09.1995. The services of\n\nSh. Krishan Chand were regularised in terms of Government order No. 1423-\n\nGAD of 2009 dated 14.10.2009 vide government order No. 129-SWD of 2014\n\ndated 02.06.2014 under the J&K Special Provisions Act, 2010 on the basis of\n\nthe information submitted by the subordinate officers. As per record of the writ\n\npetition, the petitioner had not raised any such plea with respect to Sh. Krishan\n\nChand and Smt. Sishna Devi.\n\n09. The petitioner further states that she has been subjected to discrimination,\n\nin as much as the services of similarly situated employees were regularized in\n\nthe year 1995, 1997 and 2000. Learned counsel for the petitioner has \nplaced\n\nreliance upon\n a judgment of Hon‟ble Supreme Court rendered in the case of\n\nState of Karnataka Vs. Uma Devi and others\n (2006)4 SCC1 and the judgments\n\nof this Court passed in SWP No. 534/2016 titled as Ghulam Mohammad Malik\n\n 5 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\nVs. State of J&K and others and in SWP No. 1177/2016 titled as \nIftikhar\n\nAhmed Itoo and others Vs. State of J&K and others\n 2019(4) JKJ242.\n\n10. We heard the learned counsel for the parties, perused the material on\n\nrecord and considered the matter.\n\n11. Admittedly, the petitioner herein was appointed on ad hoc basis on\n\n27.11.1991 purely on stop-gap arrangement with a break of one day. The\n\ngovernment issued order No. 1285-GAD of 2001 dated 06.11.2001 based on the\n\ncabinet decision No. 135/11(B) dated 10.09.2001 whereby it was inter alia\n\nordered that all ad hoc appointees to non-gazetted posts recruited from time to\n\ntime beyond 29.12.1988 till the date of issue of the said order i.e., 10.09.2001\n\nwho were still in service would be considered for regularisation after completing\n\nseven years of continuous service from the date of appointment dispensing with\n\nreference to the posts held to them to Service Selection Board subject to certain\n\nconditions. This Government order was purportedly issued consequent upon\n\njudgment dated 12th February, 1998 passed by one of the learned Single Judges\n\nof this Court in SWP No. 283/1994, \nUttam Singh Vs. State of J&K\n, holding that\n\nan ad hocee cannot be worse than a daily rated worker and that the petitioner\n\ntherein would be entitled to regularization under SRO 64 of 1994 providing for\n\nregularization of daily rated workers after completion of seven years‟\n\ncontinuous service.\n\n12. Subsequently, in 2004 the Government, in supersession of the aforesaid\n\nGovernment order No. 1285-GAD of 2001, dated 06.11.2001, issued order No.\n\n168-GAD of 2004, dated 9th February, 2004 read with two other Government\n\nOrders, it was, inter alia, ordered that all ad hoc appointments made after\n\n28.07.1989 and continued in service till the date of issue of the aforesaid order,\n\ni.e., 20.02.2004, and also those ad hocees, who were appointed by the General\n\n 6 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\nAdministration Department or with approval from the General Administration\n\nDepartment and continued in service till August 2002 or thereafter, were\n\nordered to be converted into contractual appointments with effect from\n\n01.02.2004, and these contractual appointments were to subsist till 31.12.2004\n\nor till selections against these posts were made by the concerned agencies,\n\nwhichever would be earlier.\n\n13. This Court in a case titled Thomas Masih Vs. State of J&K and others,\n\n2004(1) SLJ 3, has directed the government to make selections from amongst\n\neligible adhocees, who may apply, shall be made strictly on the basis of merit\n\nand suitability in accordance with the rules without being influenced by the fact\n\nof the adhocees having been previously appointed or continued on adhoc basis\n\nor on contractual basis. While framing the scheme for selection of Class IV\n\nadhocee/contractual appointees, the Government shall take note of the\n\nobservations and directions made and in future the Government and its various\n\nfunctionaries shall ensure that no adhoc appointment is made dehors Rule 14 of\n\nthe Classification, Control and Appeal Rules, 1956. In no case such\n\narrangements are continued beyond the prescribed period of nine months.\n\n \nIt may be mentioned here that the decision in \nThomas Masih Vs. State of\n\nJ&K\n (supra), was upheld by a Division Bench of this Court in LPA(SW) No.\n\n104/2004, \nShafiqa Begum Vs. State of J&K\n, and analogous appeals vide\n\njudgment dated 19.07.2004. There was an another batch of LPAs arising out of\n\nsome judgments rendered by another learned Single Judge of the High Court.\n\nThe Division Bench hearing those LPAs was of the view that some of the points\n\nraised therein had not been taken in LPA No. 104/2004 and the connected\n\nLPAs. Therefore, the Division Bench referred the matter to the Full Bench. The\n\nmatter remains pending before the Full Bench for a pretty long time.\n\n 7 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\nMeanwhile, the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir enacted the \nJammu and\n\nKashmir Civil Services (Special Provisions) Act, 2010\n which came into effect\n\nfrom 20.04.2010.The object of the said Act was to provide for regularization of\n\nthe employees appointed on ad hoc, contractual or consolidated basis.\n\n14. The petitioner was working as ad hocee since many decades and she was\n\naware of the fact that the service of similarly circumstanced ad hocees was\n\nregularized by the government from time to time. She was also not ignorant of\n\nthe judgments passed in favour of Sh. Krishan Chand and Smt. Sishna Devi\n\nMoreover, since she was working in the Department, she was expected to have\n\nthe knowledge of the government orders and acts enacted/issued by the\n\ngovernment from time to time.\n\n15. It is a settled principle of law that fence sitters cannot be allowed to\n\ndispute or challenge the validity of the order after having knowledge of the fact\n\nthat the similarly circumstanced persons were given benefit at one point of time.\n\nAdmittedly, it was within the knowledge of the petitioner that few of the\n\nsimilarly circumstanced employees had been regularized in the year 1995, 1997\n\nand 2000.\n\n16. The petitioner was fully aware of the litigation being filed by Sh. Krishan\n\nChand and Smt. Sishna Devi and also the benefits of regularization granted to\n\nboth of them despite that the petitioner chose to be a fence sitter for more than\n\ntwo decades. \nIn this regard the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in a case titled \nShiba\n\nShankar Mohapatra Vs. State of Orissa\n (2010) 12 SCC has observed in\n\nparagrapgh-29 as under:-\n\n \"29. It is settled law that fence-sitters cannot be allowed to raise\n the dispute or challenge the validity of the order after its\n conclusion. No party can claim the relief as a matter of right as\n one of the grounds for refusing relief is that the person\n approaching the Court is guilty of delay and the laches. The\n\n 8 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\n Court exercising public law jurisdiction does not encourage\n agitation of stale claims where the right of third parties\n crystallises in the interregnum.\"\n\n17. The Hon‟ble Supreme Court in another case i.e., \nState of U.P. Vs. Arvind\n\nKumar Srivastava\n (2015) 1 SCC 347 in paragraph- 22.2 has held as under:-\n\n \"22.2. However, this principle is subject to well-recognized\n exceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as\n acquiescence. Those persons who did not challenge the wrongful\n action in their cases and acquiesced into the same and woke up\n after long delay only because of the reason that their\n counterparts who had approached the court earlier in time\n succeeded in their efforts, then such employees cannot claim that\n the benefit of the judgment rendered in the case of similarly\n situated persons be extended to them. They would be treated as\n fence-sitters and laches and delays, and/or the acquiescence,\n would be a valid ground to dismiss their claim.\"\n\n18. In view of the above, coupled with the fact that the petitioner claimed\n\nbenefit of regularization with effect from 01.12.1998 on the basis of the\n\nGovernment order dated 06.11.2001 on her completion of requisites service of\n\nseven years but had not staked any claim to such regularization during the\n\ncurrency of the said government order and allowed it to be lapsed on\n\n09.02.2004, she, disentitled herself from its benefit. Thereafter, the claim of\n\nregularization of the petitioner could have only been considered under the\n\nprovisions of the Act of 2010. The writ court has duly considered the same and\n\ninstead of allowing the benefit of regularization with effect from 17.08.2017\n\npartly accepting the claim of the petitioner allowed her the benefit of\n\nregularization from 27.09.2010\n\n19. We do not find any error or illegality in granting the above benefit to the\n\npetitioner, inasmuch as, by implication she waived her right to seek\n\nregularization under the Government order dated 06.11.2001 as no material was\n\n 9 LPA No. 262 of 2019\n\n c/w\n\n LPA No. 138/2020\n\nproduced on record that she ever made any claim for regularization thereunder\n\nwithin the time it had remained in operation.\n\n20. As far as the contention of the State counsel that the petitioner is entitled\n\nto the benefit of regularization from the date of the order of regularization, we\n\nfind no force in it and the learned Single Judge has rightly granted the said\n\nbenefit from the back date i.e. 27.09.2010.\n\n21. For all what has been discussed above, we are of the view that learned\n\nSingle Judge did not commit any error of law warranting interference of this\n\nCourt. These appeals lack merit and are dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\n (MOKSHA KHAJURIA KAZMI) (PANKAJ MITHAL)\n JUDGE CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nJAMMU\n12.05.2022\nAbinash\n Whether the order is speaking: Yes/No.\n Whether the order is reportable: Yes/No.",
