The Cross Objection came to be filed belatedly in RFA\n\nCross Objection No.17/2010 by respondents/defendants 2 and\n\n3 opposing the decree insofar as directing the defendants 2 and\n\n3 to return Rs.55,000/- with damages of Rs.55,000/- and\n\ninterest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of\n\nagreement of sale on the earnest money, till realization.\n\n3.

The brief facts which are utmost necessary for disposal\n\nof the present appeal and cross objection are as under:\n\n A suit came to be filed by the plaintiff initially against first\n\ndefendant in O.S.No.8329/1995 for the relief of judgment and\n\ndecree directing the first defendant to comply with the terms of\n\nthe agreement of sale dated 18.10.1995 and execute the sale\n\ndeed in favour of the plaintiff at the cost of the plaintiff by\n\nreceiving balance amount in a sum of Rs.65,000/- or such\n\namount determined by the Court, failing which, the sale deed\n\nbe executed in accordance with law and consequential relief of\n\npossession of the property directing the first defendant along\n\nwith defendants 2 and 3 to put the plaintiff in possession of the\n\nsuit schedule property.\n\n5. The suit property is described as under:\n\n \"All that piece and parcel of the property bearing site\n Nos.16 and 17 bearing house list No.245, situated at\n Babusabarapalya, Chellakere Gramatana, K.R.Puram\n Hobli, Bengaluru South Taluk, and measuring East to\n West 40 feet and North to South 60 feet, bounded on the:\n\n East by : Srinivasa Reddy's property,\n West by : Road,\n North by : Site No.15,\n South by : K.R.Mahadevan's property.\n\n And including A.C.sheet house roofing compound.\n\n -6-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n6. Upon service of suit summons, defendant entered\n\nappearance and filed written statement stating that first\n\ndefendant has alienated the property in favour of private\n\npersons by virtue of registered sale deed dated 27.11.1995\n\nwhereby, plaint got amended and subsequent purchasers were\n\nimpleaded as defendants 2 and 3. Consequentially, prayer\n\ncolumn was also amended seeking direction to all the\n\ndefendants to execute the sale deed.\n\n7. In the plaint it is contended that defendant No.1 is the\n\nowner of the suit property and he has entered into agreement\n\nof sale of suit property in favour of plaintiff on 18.10.1995 for\n\ntotal consideration of Rs.1,60,000/-. According to the plaintiff,\n\na sum of Rs.55,000/- was paid as advance sale consideration to\n\nthe defendant No.1 and as per the terms of the agreement,\n\nbalance sale consideration of Rs.1,05,000/- was agreed to be\n\npayable by plaintiff to defendant No.1 on the date of execution\n\nof sale deed and two months' time was stipulated for\n\ncompletion of the sale transaction under sale agreement.\n\n8. Plaintiff further contended that within the stipulated\n\nperiod, plaintiff was always ready and willing to pay balance\n\n -7-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nsale consideration of Rs.1,05,000/-. However, it is the\n\ncontention of the plaintiff that, there was a demand made by\n\ndefendant No.1 to the plaintiff for payment of Rs.40,000/-\n\ntowards balance sale consideration and as such, plaintiff paid\n\nfurther sum of Rs.40,000/- on 07.11.1995, but there was no\n\nreceipt passed on by defendant No.1 to the plaintiff. But first\n\ndefendant promised that same will be adjusted towards balance\n\nsale consideration at the time of registration of the sale deed.\n\n9. Even after payment of said sum of Rs.40,000/-, plaintiff\n\nwas ready and willing to pay balance sum of Rs.65,000/- and\n\nhe demanded the first defendant to execute the sale deed in his\n\nfavour and also demanded the title deeds to be furnished to\n\nhim for preparation of the sale deed. All such demands went in\n\nvain and plaintiff came to know that first defendant is planning\n\nto alienate the suit property in favour of third parties and\n\ntherefore, plaintiff caused a legal notice dated 20.11.1995\n\nthrough registered post to the first defendant.\n\n10. Plaintiff further contended that after issuance of notice on\n\n20.11.1995, first defendant replied the legal notice on\n\n -8-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n01.12.1995. Since there is denial in the reply notice, plaintiff\n\nwas constrained to file the above suit with the aforesaid prayer.\n\n11. After the plaint got amended, further plea was added by\n\nthe plaintiff by stating that sale made by first defendant in\n\nfavour of defendants 2 and 3 is a clandestine sale and same is\n\nmade only to defeat the rights of the plaintiff. As such,\n\ndefendants 2 and 3 are not bonafide purchasers for value and\n\nsale deed executed by first defendant in favour of defendants 2\n\nand 3 is a sham. Therefore, plaintiff sought for decreeing the\n\nsuit.\n\n12. The first defendant filed the written statement denying\n\nthe plaint averments in toto. First defendant also contended\n\nthat the suit property has been sold in favour of defendants 2\n\nand 3 and therefore, suit is to be dismissed.\n\n13. Defendants 2 and 3 filed written statement stating that\n\nthey are bonafide purchasers for value, inasmuch as they have\n\nentered into agreement with first defendant for sale of the\n\nproperty on 08.09.1995 which is much earlier to the suit\n\n -9-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nagreement and in pursuance to the said agreement, sale deed\n\ncame to be executed by first defendant in their favour on\n\n27.11.1995 and the averments made by plaintiff with regard to\n\nsale deed of defendants are incorrect and sought for dismissal\n\nof the suit.\n\n14. In view of the rival contentions of the parties, the Trial\n\nCourt raised the following issues:\n\n ISSUES\n\n (1) Whether the plaintiff proves the agreement of sale\n dated 18.10.1995 executed by the defendant in\n respect of the schedule site?\n\n (2) Whether he proves payment of Rs.55,000/- by\n way of advance under the agreement?\n\n (3) Whether he proves further payment of\n Rs.40,000/- to the defendant on 07.11.1995?\n\n (4) Whether the defendant proves that the sale\n agreement is void and unenforceable under law?\n\n (5) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of\n specific performance as claimed?\n\n (6) What relief/reliefs the parties are entitled to?\n\n Additional Issue framed on 04.12.2003\n\n (1) Whether the defendant Nos.2 and 3 proves that\n they are the bonafide purchaser of the suit\n\n - 10 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n schedule property for value with notice of the prior\n agreement?\n\n Additional Issue framed on 02.09.2004\n\n (1) Whether the suit is barred by limitation?\n (2) Whether the suit is bad for mis-joinder of parties?\n (3) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs\n sought against defendant Nos.2 and 3?\n\n Additional Issue framed on 25.08.2006\n\n (1) Whether the 1st defendant proves that he has\n entered into an agreement with 2nd and 3rd\n defendants on 8.9.1995?\n\n (2) Whether the 1st defendant furthers proves that\n plaintiff created the agreement of sale in favour of\n the plaintiff?\n\n (3) Whether the plaintiff proves that he is always\n ready and willing to perform his part of contract?\n\n15. In order to prove his case, plaintiff got examined himself\n\nas P.W.1 and relied on seven documents which were exhibited\n\nand marked as Exs.P.1 to 7, comprising of sale deed at Ex.P.1,\n\ncopy of legal notice at Ex.P.2, reply to the legal notice at\n\nEx.P.3, certified copy of sale deed at Ex.P.4, encumbrance\n\ncertificate at Ex.P.5, copy of the sale deed at Ex.P.6 and RP\n\nacknowledgment at Ex.P.7.\n\n - 11 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n16. Per contra, on behalf of defendants, first defendant-M.H.\n\nMalik got examined as D.W.1, one of the subsequent purchaser\n\nviz., Kala Ramalingam was examined as D.W.2 and one\n\nMohammed Haneef, an advocate got examined as D.W.3. On\n\nbehalf of defendants, two documents were exhibited and\n\nmarked as Exs.D.1 and D.2 comprising of agreement of sale\n\ndated 08.09.1995 at Ex.D.1 and sale deed dated 27.11.1995 at\n\nEx.D.2.\n\n17. On conclusion of recording of evidence, learned Trial\n\nJudge heard the parties in detail and on cumulative\n\nconsideration of the oral and documentary evidence placed on\n\nrecord by the parties, decreed the suit of the plaintiff in part, as\n\nunder:\n\n \"In the result, the suit is partly decreed with costs.\n\n The prayer for specific performance of contract for\n execution of sale deed in favour of plaintiff is hereby\n rejected.\n\n The plaintiff is entitled for refund of earnest money of\n Rs.55,000/- with damages of Rs.55,000/- and interest at\n the rate of 6% per annum from the date of agreement of\n sale on the earnest money till realization from the\n defendant Nos.1 to 3.\"\n\n - 12 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n18. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree,\n\nplaintiff has preferred the present Regular First Appeal\n\nNo.2314/2007 on the following grounds:\n\n  The appellant plaintiff has examined himself as Pw.1\n & whereas the 1st defendant has been examined as\n Dw.1 and the 3rd defendant has been examined as\n Dw.2 and one Mohammed Haneef has been\n examined as Dw.3.\n\n  Pw.1 has deposed as to the contents of the plaint\n and on a perusal of the cross-examination of Pw.1\n made by the 1st defendant, it is clear as to the\n execution of the Agreement of sale vide Ex.P1 and\n the signature of the 1st defendant has been marked\n as Ex.P1(a) and signature of the appellant - plaintiff\n has been marked as Ex.P1(b) and the signatures of\n Mahadevan and Venkatesh, who are the attestors\n are marked as Exs.P1(c) & (d). The legal notice\n issued by the appellant plaintiff is marked as Ex.P2\n and the reply sent by the 1st defendant is marked as\n Ex.P3 and hence, from his evidence, it is clear that\n the first defendant having admitted para-9 of the\n Agreement of sale and he having admitted that the\n plaintiff is only entitled to liquidated damages as per\n the terms of the Agreement and hence, the first\n defendant cannot and he is not entitled to deny the\n Agreement of Sale in question executed by him in\n favour of the appellant - plaintiff.\n\n - 13 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n Dw.2 is by name Kala Ramalingam, the third\n defendant has been examined and his evidence is\n contrary to the written statement filed by him.\n One M.I.Mohammed Haneef has been examined as\n Dw.3 and his evidence do not help the defendants in\n any manner.\n\n The Trial Court as per Issue No. I has held that the\n Agreement dt:18/10/95 vide Ex.P1 executed by the\n first defendant in favour of the appellant - plaintiff is\n proved.\n\n So far as Issue No.2 is concerned, the Trial Court has\n held that a sum of Rs.55,000/- was paid by way of\n advance under the said Agreement of Sale.\n So far as Issue No.4 is concerned, it is held that the\n alleged Agreement vide Ex.P1 is enforceable under\n law.\n\n So far as additional issue framed on 4/12/2003 and\n additional issue No.1 framed on 25/8/2006 i.e., as to\n whether the defendants 2 & 3 are the bonafide\n purchasers of the suit property without notice and as\n to whether the first defendant proves that he had\n entered into an Agreement of Sale with the\n defendants 2 & 3 on 8/9/95 and the Trial Court erred\n in holding that the defendants 2 & 3 are the bonafide\n purchasers and that the first defendant had executed\n the Agreement of Sale dt:8/9/95 in favour of the\n defendants 2 & 3. Such a finding is incorrect in view\n of the Written Statement filed by the first defendant\n as well as the written statement filed by the third\n defendant, wherein they have conceded that the\n plaintiff is only entitled to refund of money with\n\n -

Pl and also having held that a sum of Rs.55,000/-\n has been paid under the said Agreement of Sale and\n having held that the Agreement of Sale vide Exhibit -\n P1 is proved and hence, the Agreement of Sale vide\n Exhibit - P1 is binding not only as against D1, but\n also as against D2 & D3, since D2 & D3 had the\n knowledge of the Agreement of Sale and also, when\n the first defendant had sent the reply as per Exhibit-\n P3 to the notice of the plaintiff vide Exhibit-P2, the\n first defendant has not revealed as to the execution\n of the alleged Agreement of Sale dt:8/9/95 in favour\n of defendants 2 & 3 and hence, the alleged\n Agreement of Sale dt:8/9/95 and the alleged Sale\n Deed dt:27/11/95 were got up only with an intention\n of depriving the plaintiff-appellant and hence, the\n finding of the Court below that the defendants 2 & 3\n are the bonafide purchasers is incorrect.\n So far as additional issue No.3 framed on 25/8/2006,\n the Trial Court has clearly held that the plaintiff has\n always been ready. and willing to perform his part of\n the contract and in view of such a finding also, the\n suit ought to have been decreed.\n\n So far as additional issue No.4 is concerned as to\n whether the defendant proves that the Sale\n Agreement executed in favour of the plaintiff is void\n and unenforceable under law, the Court has held\n that the defendants have proved that the Agreement\n is unenforceable under law and such a finding is\n\n - 15 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n incorrect and holding the said issue in favour of the\n first defendant is not sustainable under law.\n So far as additional Issue No.1 framed on 2/9/2004\n as to whether the suit is barred by limitation and the\n same is also held in favour of the plaintiff and on this\n count also, the suit ought to have been decreed.\n So far as additional Issue No.2 framed on 2/9/2004\n with regard to as to whether the suit is bad for mis-\n joinder of parties and the court has held that the suit\n is not bad for mis-joinder of parties.\n So far as additional Issue No.5 is concerned as to\n whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of\n specific performance and the said issue is held in\n negative holding that the defendants 2 & 3 will be\n put into hardship and loss due to escalation in the\n land value and such a finding is without any basis\n and without evidence and besides, contrary to law.\n So far as Issue No.6 and additional Issue No.3\n dt:2/9/2004 i.e., with regard to whether the plaintiff\n is entitled to the relief as sought for and the court\n grossly erred in holding that the plaintiff is entitled to\n the refund of the amount with liquidated damages\n and such a finding is contrary to law.\n\n The appellant submits that during the subsistence of\n the Agreement of Sale vide Exhibit-P1, the first and\n the defendants 2 & 3 have colluded among\n themselves in creating the Agreement of Sale\n dt:8/9/95 and also in getting the Sale Deed dt:\n\n 27/11/95 executed by the first defendant in favour\n of the defendants 2 & 3, which clearly demonstrates\n that the defendants have played fraud only with an\n\n - 16 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n intention to deprive the plaintiff - appellant of his\n legitimate right over the property in question and the\n Court ought to have decreed the suit for the relief of\n specific performance as against all the defendants.\n The appellant submits that \nSec. 12(c)\n and \n21(a)\n of\n the Specific Relief Act is for the benefit of the\n promisor i.e., the first defendant and not for the\n benefit of the subsequent purchasers, who are the\n defendants 2 & 3 and that too, when they have\n entered upon the venture of purchase of the\n property with full knowledge of the Agreement vide\n Exhibit-P1 and as such the defendants 2 & 3 cannot\n plead that the appellant - plaintiff is only entitled to\n the payment of advance amount and liquidated\n damages and in view of such a pleading putforth by\n the defendants 2 & 3, they were aware of the\n Agreement of Sale in favour of the plaintiff and from\n the same, it is clear that the alleged Agreement\n dt:8/9/95 is the created document and which fact is\n also clear from the reply sent by the first defendant\n to the notice of the plaintiff.\n\n On a perusal of the evidence on record there are no\n equitable considerations in favour of the defendants\n 2 & 3, since the property in question lies as the\n vacant property without any kind of improvements or\n putting up any kind of constructions by the\n defendants 2 & 3 over the property in question.\n\n The clause No.9 in the Agreement of Sale vide\n Exhibit - P1 with regard to stipulation of damages\n was made only for the purpose of securing\n performing the contract and not for refund of the\n\n - 17 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n money or damages and the court grossly erred in\n interpreting the said clause in favour of the\n defendants and such a finding is contrary to law.\n On a perusal of the documents on evidence on\n record, the appellant-plaintiff has not contravened\n the terms of the Agreement of Sale within the\n stipulated time and on the other hand, he was\n always ready and willing to comply with the terms of\n the Agreement of Sale and even the appellant\n plaintiff had also issued the notice to the first\n defendant within the stipulated period and the Trial\n Court grossly erred in refusing the relief of specific\n performance in favour of the plaintiff.\n There has been no delay even on the part of the\n appellant- plaintiff in exercising his right over the\n property under the Agreement of Sale.\n\n The appellant submits that in decreeing the suit for\n specific performance no hardship or loss or injury will\n be caused to either the first defendant or the\n defendants 2 & 3.\n\n The appellant submits that U/s.20 of the \nSpecific\n Relief Act\n, the discretion exercised by the Trial Court\n is arbitrary and the same is unreasonable and not\n guided by the established judicial principles and\n consequently, the Trial Court ought to have granted\n the relief of specific performance in favour of the\n plaintiff.\n\n The alleged Agreement of Sale dt:8/9/95 is very\n much doubtful and it amounts to creating of such\n document, which is clear from the evidence on\n record and on this count also, the Court grossly\n\n -

Insofar as decreeing the suit in part and directing\n\ndefendants 2 and 3 to pay a sum of Rs.55,000/- with interest\n\nat the rate of 6% per annum, being the advance sale\n\nconsideration and also sum of Rs.55,000/- as damages, is\n\nbeing questioned by defendants 2 and 3 in the RFA Cross\n\nObjection No.17/2010, on the following grounds:\n\n  The Trial Courts erred in decreeing the suit of the\n Plaintiff even in part, whereas the suit Ought to have\n been dismissed atleast against these defendants in\n toto. The suit as a whole, having come to the\n conclusion that Plaintiff has failed to prove the\n payment of Rs.40,000/- as alleged in the Plaint. The\n conduct of the Plaintiff having been questioned by the\n learned trial judge, inter-alia holdings that the\n Plaintiff has come up with a false case and therefore\n the learned Judge ought not to have decreed the suit\n even in part.\n\n  The Trial judge grossly erred in holding that the suit\n being barred by time, against these Defendants, even\n though they were impleaded in the suit as party later,\n no prayer was sought against these defendants in\n time and therefore, that should have been sufficient\n for the Trial Judge to have dismissed the suit.\n  Assuming but not conceding that such a prayer was\n not to be asked even then, the trial Court ought not\n\n - 19 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n to have directed these Defendants to refund any part\n of the money stated to have been paid by the\n Appellant to the 1st Defendant or pay any interest on\n the said amount to the Plaintiff, in view of the\n admitted position that what was alleged to be have\n been paid by the Plaintiff is to the Defendant No.1\n and not to these Defendants and therefore if at all\n there could be a Decree in favour of the Appellant, as\n ordered by the Trial Court, it ought to be only against\n the 1st Defendant and not against these Defendants.\n The Trial Court could not have passed any kind of\n decree against these Defendants to any extent. If at\n all the Plaintiff was entitled to any relief, at the most\n it should have been only against first Defendant and\n not against these Defendants whilst the Trial Court\n came to the conclusion that the Agreement in favour\n of Defendant No.2 and 3 were earlier in point of time\n to the Agreement claimed by the Plaintiff, the\n Agreement relied upon by the Plaintiff must\n necessarily yield to the sale deed executed by the 1st\n Defendant in favour of Defendant 2 and 3. The only\n relief the Plaintiff would have been entitled to if he\n had proved the Agreement in his favour which\n admittedly was later in point of time, would be for\n refund of the advance amount only allegedly paid by\n the Plaintiff to 1st Defendant and that too from the 1st\n Defendant only and not from the other Defendants.\n The Trial Court having come to a definite conclusion\n that the Plaintiff is not entitled to Schedule Property\n having applied the well settle principle of law that\n equitable discretion should not be exercised in favour\n\n - 20 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n of a person who has come to court with unclean\n hands, should not have decreed the suit even in part,\n but should have dismissed the suit in its entirety.\n  The Trial Court having found that the Plaintiff is a\n speculator and not a truthful witness and having\n weighed the evidence on golden scales should have\n dismissed the suit in toto.\n\n  At all events, the judgments and Decree of the Trial\n Court in decreeing the suit of the Plaintiff in part is\n wrong and untenable, so far as it relates to fastening\n the liability on these Defendants. The decree passed\n against these defendants are contrary to the evidence\n on record, documents produced and relied upon by\n the parties and also contrary to the settled principles\n of law.\n\n20. Reiterating the grounds urged in the appeal\n\nmemorandum, Sri K.Bhanu Prasad, counsel representing the\n\nappellant vehemently contended that the plaintiff was always\n\nready and willing to perform his portion of the contract and he\n\nhas paid sum of Rs.55,000/- as advance sale consideration\n\nunder Ex.P.1 which is sale agreement. Thereafter, at the\n\nrequest of first defendant, he has paid sum of Rs.40,000/- as\n\nsecond advance of the sale consideration on 07.11.1995. But\n\nthe same was not evidenced by executing any receipt and\n\nplaintiff believed the promise made by the first defendant that\n\n - 21 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nthe said sum of Rs.40,000/- would be adjusted in the final sale\n\nconsideration.\n\n21. He further contended that despite receiving major portion\n\nof the sale consideration, plaintiff clandestinely sold the\n\nproperty in favour of defendants 2 and 3 by concocting the\n\ndocument marked at Exs.D1 and D2. He further contended\n\nthat the sale deed Ex.D.2 is dated 27.11.1995 i.e, after receipt\n\nof legal notice issued by the plaintiff marked at Ex.P.2 and after\n\nthe sale has been effected, reply notice came to be issued by\n\nfirst defendant and in the reply notice, there is no whisper by\n\nthe first defendant about the earlier agreement or sale deed\n\nwhich exposes the cunning nature of the first defendant. As\n\nsuch, defendant Nos.2 and 3 are not to be termed as bonafide\n\npurchasers of the suit property and their sale deed is nothing\n\nbut a sham document which has come into force only to defeat\n\nthe right of the plaintiff under Ex.P.1 and sought for allowing\n\nthe appeal.\n\n22. He further pointed out that mere non passing of receipt\n\nby the first defendant for having received Rs.40,000/- as\n\nadditional sale consideration cannot be a circumstance which\n\n - 22 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nwould non suit the claim of the plaintiff in getting the suit\n\ndecreed for specific performance and sought for allowing the\n\nappeal.\n\n23. He also argued that the sale deed in favour of defendant\n\nNos.2 and 3 executed by first defendant on 27.11.1995 is well\n\nwithin a period of two months i.e., the time that has been\n\nstipulated under Ex.P.1 which is dated 18.10.1995 and\n\ntherefore, the sale in favour of 2nd and 3rd defendant cannot be\n\ncountenanced by this Court and sought for allowing the appeal.\n\n24. It is his further argument that if the first defendant is\n\nrighteous and prudent person, he should not have entered into\n\nan agreement on 18.10.1995 with the plaintiff if there was an\n\nagreement on 08.09.1995 as is propounded by defendants 2\n\nand 3. The silence on the part of the first defendant while\n\nexecuting the agreement on 18.10.1995 which stands proved\n\nby placing cogent and convincing evidence on record by\n\nplaintiff, would speak volumes about the conduct of the first\n\ndefendant in clandestinely selling the suit property in favour of\n\ndefendants 2 and 3 and therefore, sought to allow the appeal.\n\n - 23 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n25. Sri Bhanu Prasad also contended that the suit of the\n\nplaintiff needs to be decreed in toto and therefore, cross\n\nobjection is meritless and same needs to be dismissed.\n\n26. Per contra, Sri R.Vijayakumar, learned counsel\n\nrepresenting defendants 2 and 3 who are respondent Nos.2 and\n\n3 in this appeal contended that the agreement entered into by\n\nthe first defendant on 08.09.1995 is marked at Ex.D.1.\n\n27. He further contended that the stamp papers purchased\n\nfor preparation of the said document by the first defendant also\n\nmentions the date as 08.09.1995 and it has come into being in\n\nnatural course.\n\n28. He further argued that in pursuance of the agreement\n\ndated 08.09.1995, sale deed came to be executed on\n\n27.11.1995 by first defendant in favour of defendants 2 and 3\n\nvide Ex.D.2.\n\n29. He also brought to the notice of this Court that the first\n\ndefendant was competent enough execute the sale deed in\n\nfavour of defendants 2 and 3 vide Ex.D.2 after receipt of\n\n - 24 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nnecessary sale consideration mentioned in Ex.D.2 and\n\ntherefore, defendants 2 and 3 are to be construed as bonafide\n\npurchasers for value.\n\n30. He also argued that the first defendant was cross\n\nexamined in extenso by the plaintiff whereunder, it is not\n\nsuggested that agreement dated 08.09.1995 is concocted by\n\nthe first defendant in active collusion with defendants 2 and 3.\n\n31. He also contended that if the first defendant has played\n\nfraud on the plaintiff by executing an agreement on 18.10.1995\n\nwith plaintiff by suppressing the agreement dated 08.09.1995\n\nmarked at Ex.D.1, remedy for the plaintiff is to proceed solely\n\nagainst the first defendant.\n\n32. Therefore, Trial Court decreeing the suit of the plaintiff\n\nagainst defendants 2 and 3 by directing them to pay the\n\nadvance sale consideration in a sum of Rs.55,000/- with\n\ninterest at 6% per annum and also directing to pay damages of\n\nRs.55,000/- is incorrect and sought for dismissal of the appeal\n\nfiled by the plaintiff as against defendants 2 and 3 and also\n\nsought for allowing cross objection whereby the obligation\n\n - 25 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ncreated under the decree insofar as defendants 2 and 3 needs\n\nto be set aside with costs.\n\n33. In reply, Sri Bhanu Prasad, counsel submitted that\n\ndefendants 2 and 3 cannot possess a better title than what first\n\ndefendant possessed.\n\n34. Therefore, liability on the suit property will have to be\n\nnow met by defendants 2 and 3 and they are also liable to\n\nexecute the sale deed in favour of plaintiff by allowing the\n\npresent appeal. In support of his arguments, counsel placed\n\nreliance on the following judgments, wherein, it is held as\n\nunder:\n\n Durga Prasad and another v. DeepChand and\n others AIR 1954 SC 75,\n\n 36. Now arises a question which touches the\n Custodian, Uttar Pradesh. The contract was for Rs\n 62,000. The plaintiff paid Rs 10,000 as earnest money\n but this was later returned, so Rs 62,000 is still due. But\n there is a conveyance outstanding in favour of the\n appellants for which they have paid, according to their\n case, Rs 58,000. If the Rs 62,000 due to the Nawab is\n paid to him, or to the Custodian, U.P. who represents\n his estate, it is evident that the Nawab, who is at fault,\n will be paid twice over for the same property and his\n\n - 26 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nestate will benefit accordingly while the appellants will\nbe left to pursue their remedies against the Nawab or\nhis estate. The question is whether we have the power\nto direct that the Rs 58,000 be paid to the appellants\ninstead of to the Nawab and thus obviate further, and\npossibly fruitless, litigation. But before we decide that,\nwe will consider another question which is bound up\nwith it, namely, the proper form of decree in such cases.\n\n 37. The practice of the courts in India has not\nbeen uniform and three distinct lines of thought emerge.\n(We are of course confining our attention to a\npurchaser's suit for specific performance.) According to\none point of view, the proper form of decree is to\ndeclare the subsequent purchase void as against the\nplaintiff and direct conveyance by the vendor alone. A\nsecond considers that both vendor and vendee should\njoin, while a third would limit execution of the\nconveyance to the subsequent purchaser alone.\n\n \n42. In our opinion, the proper form of decree is to\ndirect specific performance of the contract between the\nvendor and the plaintiff and direct the subsequent\ntransferee to join in the conveyance so as to pass on the\ntitle which resides in him to the plaintiff. He does not\njoin in any special covenants made between the plaintiff\nand his vendor; all he does is to pass on his title to the\nplaintiff. This was the course followed by the Calcutta\nHigh Court in \nKafiladdin v. Samiraddin [Kafiladdin\n v.\nSamiraddin, AIR 1931 Cal 67 : 1930 SCC OnLine Cal 46]\nand appears to be the English practice. See Fry on\nSpecific Performance, 6th Edn., p. 90, Para 207;\n\n - 27 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nalso Potter v. Sanders [Potter v. Sanders, (1846) 6 Hare\n1 : 67 ER 1057] . We direct accordingly.\n\n 43. That brings us to the question of the Rs\n62,000. We do not think it would be right to lay down\nthat in every case the balance of the purchase money\nshould be paid to the subsequent transferee up to the\nextent of the consideration paid by him. There may be\nequities between the vendor and the subsequent\ntransferee which would make that improper, so unless\nthey fight the question out as between themselves and\nit is decided as an issue in the case, the normal rule\nshould be to require that the money be paid to the\nvendor. But the circumstances here are peculiar. The\nparties before us were prepared to compromise, and had\nthe Nawab been here it is more than probable that he\nwould have been glad to agree so as to avoid further\nlitigation. But he is in Pakistan and is beyond the\njurisdiction of the Indian courts. We think it would be\ninequitable to leave the appellants to pursue what in all\nprobability is only a will-o'-the-wisp and for us to\naugment the Nawab's estate by what would appear to\nbe an unjust enrichment. This is an equitable relief and\nwe have a wide discretion. We joined the Custodian,\nU.P. to afford him the opportunity of showing why we\nshould not take what appears to be the just and\nequitable course. We have afforded him an opportunity\nof showing how the Nawab could have defended a suit\nby the appellants for refund of the consideration. As he\nhas not been able to show us anything in the contract\nbetween the Nawab and the appellants, or in the\ncovenants of their deed, which would disentitle the\n\n - 28 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nappellants from claiming Rs 58,000 from the Nawab, we\nconsider it right that Rs 58,000 should be paid to them\nand Rs 4000 to the Custodian, U.P. All that the\nCustodian, U.P. was able to urge was that the whole\namount had vested in him and so was his. But that is\nnot so. The plaintiff was directed to pay a sum of Rs\n62,000 into court as a condition precedent to the\nexecution of a sale deed in his favour. Curiously enough,\nthe decree does not say what is to be done with the\nmoney when it is paid into court. But so long as it is in\ncourt under those conditions it lies there subject to such\ndecree as may ultimately be passed in appeal. We\ntherefore have full power to direct payment of Rs\n58,000 to the appellants instead of to the Nawab,\nespecially as there is this curious lacuna in the decree.\n\nRamesh Chandra Chandiok v. Chuni Lal\nSabharwal\n, AIR 1971 SC 1238\n\n 8. Coming to the last point, the High Court has\nheld that the appellants were disentitled to a decree for\nspecific performance because a statement was made at\nthe Bar that during the pendency of the appeal they had\nexecuted the decree of the trial court and an amount of\nRs 7500 had been deposited by the respondents\npursuant to the execution proceedings. It is true that\nthe appellant could not accept satisfaction of the decree\nof the trial court and yet prefer an appeal against that\ndecree. That may well have brought them within the\nprinciple that when the plaintiff has elected to proceed\nin some other manner than for specific performance be\n\n - 29 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ncannot ask for the latter relief. This is what Scrutton, L.\nJ., said in Dexters Limited v. Hill Crest Oil Company,\nBradford Ltd. [(1926) 1 KB 348, 358] at p. 358:\n\n \"So, in my opinion, you cannot take the benefit of\na judgment as being good and then appeal against it as\nbeing bad.\"\n\n It was further observed:\n\n \"It startles me to hear it argued that a person can\nsay the judgment is wrong and at the same time accept\npayment under the judgment as being right.\"\n\n This illustrates the rule that a party cannot\napprobate and reprobate at the same time. These\npropositions are so well-known that no possible\nexception can be taken to them. In the present case,\nhowever, the above rule cannot apply because the\nappellants had, by consistent and unequivocal conduct,\nmade it clear that they were not willing to accept the\njudgment of the trial court as correct. It has already\nbeen mentioned at a previous stage that after the\ndecision of the trial court, the appellants had even\napplied on March 31, 1958 for an injunction restraining\nthe respondents from selling or otherwise disposing of\nthe plot as it was apprehended that they were trying to\ndo so. It was stated in this application that the plaintiffs\nwould be preferring an appeal but it would take time to\nsecure certified copies. An appeal was in fact preferred\nand seriously pressed before the High Court on the relief\nrelating to specific performance. This relief is\ndiscretionary but not arbitrary and discretion must be\nexercised in accordance with the sound and reasonable\n\n - 30 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\njudicial principles. We are unable to hold that the\nconduct of the appellants, which is always an important\nelement for consideration, was such that it precluded\nthem from obtaining a decree for specific performance.\n\n \n9. It is common ground that the plot in dispute\nhas been transferred by the respondents and therefore\nthe proper form of the decree would be the same as\nindicated at p. 369 in \nLala Durga Prasad v. Lala Deep\nChand\n [(1954) SCR 360 : AIR 1954 SC 75] viz. \"to\ndirect specific performance of the contract between the\nvendor and the plaintiff and direct the subsequent\ntransferee to join in the conveyance so as to pass on the\ntitle which resides in him to the plaintiff. He does not\njoin in any special covenants made between the plaintiff\nand his vendor; all he does is to pass on his title to the\nplaintiff.\" We order accordingly. The decree of the courts\nbelow is hereby set aside and the appeal is allowed with\ncosts in this court and the High Court.\n\nAbdul Kayum Ahmad Mohammad Siddik Husan\nv. Damodhar Paikaji Kinhekar\n, AIR 1964 Bom\n\n46\n\n 6. According to him, granting pecuniary\ncompensation for non-performance of the agreement\nwould afford adequate relief to the plaintiff and,\ntherefore, specific performance ought not to be allowed.\nShri Mandlekar submitted that these sections require the\nCourt to consider the equities between the parties to the\nagreement, so that the subject-matter of the agreement\nmay be saved for the promisor and the promisee may\n\n - 31 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nbe adequately compensated in money. Upon this very\nargument, these sections appear to me to be entirely\ninapplicable to the facts of the present case. Here the\npromisor, defendant No. 1, has already parted with the\nhouse in favour of the appellants and there is no\nquestion of saving that house for the promisor, who\ncannot get back the house even if he were to be\nrequired to give to the plaintiff monetary compensation\nonly. The submission of Shri Mandlekar seemed to imply\nthat these sections could also be availed of by the\nsubsequent purchasers, even if they had purchased the\nproperty with full knowledge of the prior agreement by\nthe vendor. No authority was shown in support of that\nsuggestion. These sections appear to be only for the\nbenefit of the promisor, so that the property may be\nsaved for him and not for the benefit of subsequent\npurchasers, particularly when they have entered upon\nthe venture of the purchase with full knowledge of the\nprior agreement. The appellants, who are subsequent\npurchasers, cannot claim to take up cudgels for\ndefendant No. 1 and to urge on his behalf that only a\ndecree for monetary compensation should be passed\nagainst him. It would be interesting to note that\ndefendant No. 1, who alone could have sought\nprotection of those sections, has not cared to do so and\nhas not joined in this prayer of the appellants.\nMoreover, there is nothing on record to show that\ndefendant No. 1 is or would be in a position to pay\nmonetary compensation, if decreed.\n\n 11. The learned counsel for the appellants then\nurged that there were more equities in favour of the\n\n - 32 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ndefendant-appellants than in favour of the plaintiff.\nHowever, he did not show which were those greater\nequities in favour of the appellants as claimed. The only\nthing which he could pin-point in this connection was\nthat the appellants had paid Rs. 2,200 while the plaintiff\nhad paid Rs. 2,000 as per the findings of the Courts\nbelow. The mere fact that the appellants had paid Rs.\n2,200 would be neither here nor there when it would be\nseen that they did it, if at all they had paid that or any\nconsideration, with the knowledge that the plaintiff had\nacquired a right to get a sale-deed of this house on the\nstrength of the agreement, dated December 26, 1952.\nBy merely purporting to pay a larger consideration for\nthat house, defendants Nos. 2 to 4 cannot say that\nequities are more in their favour. Again, a person\nclaiming equities must come with clean hands. In the\ninstant case, these appellants have not only tried to\nsteal a march over the plaintiff by securing this sale in\nthe circumstances which I have discussed at\nconsiderable length but they had gone to the length of\nraising false defences in the suit. Under the\ncircumstances, no question of equities in favour of the\nappellants could arise.\n\nPrakash Chandra v. Angadlal & ors\n, AIR 1979\nSC 1241,\n \"9. The ordinary rule is that specific performance\nshould be granted. It ought to be denied only when\nequitable considerations point to its refusal and the\ncircumstances show that damages would constitute an\nadequate relief. In the present case, the conduct of the\n\n - 33 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nappellant has not been such as to disentitle him to the\nrelief of specific performance. He has acted fairly\nthroughout, and there is nothing to show that by any act\nof omission or commission he encouraged Mohsinali and\nQurban Hussain to enter into the sale with the first and\nsecond respondents. There is no evidence that the\nappellant secured an unfair advantage over Mohsinali\nand Qurban Hussain when he entered into the\nagreement. Nor is there anything to prove that the\nperformance of the contract would involve the\nrespondents in some hardship which they did not\nforesee. In our opinion, there is no reason why the\nappellant should not be granted the relief of specific\nperformance. An application has been filed before us by\nthe first and second respondents alleging that said\nrespondents had raised certain constructions on the site\nduring the pendency of the litigation and, therefore,\nspecific relief should not be granted to the appellant. It\nis denied by the appellant that any permanent\nconstructions have been erected on the land in dispute.\nIt is said that a temporary wooden structure only has\nbeen put up on a portion of the land. The respondents\nhave attempted to show by reference to a map and\nphotographs that permanent constructions have been\nmade on the site. Having regard to the material before\nus, we are unable to hold that any permanent\nconstructions have been raised on the said land. If the\nfirst and second respondents have in fact raised any\nconstructions on the site, it will be open to them to\nremove the building material when possession is\ndelivered to the appellant.\n\n - 34 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n 10. It is urged by learned counsel for the first and\nsecond respondents that the contract for sale contains a\nclause for payment of damages in case of breach of the\ncontract and that, therefore, damages should be\nawarded instead of specific performance. A perusal of\nthe terms of the contract indicates that the stipulation\nfor damages was made only for the purpose of securing\nperformance of the contract and not for the purpose of\ngiving an option of Mohsinali and Qurban Hussain of\npaying money in lieu of specific performance. Even if a\nsum has been named in the contract for sale as the\namount to be paid in case of a breach the appellant is\nentitled in law to the enforcement of the agreement.\n\n 14. The appeal is allowed, and the judgment and\ndecree of the High Court are set aside. The appellant is\nrequired to deposit Rs. 1,000, which is the balance of\nthe purchase price, in the trial Court for payment to\nrespondents No. 3 within one month of the receipt of the\nrecord from this Court. Such deposit being made within\nthe said period the respondents No. 3 will execute a sale\ndeed in favour of the appellant in accordance with the\nterms of the contract dated September 11, 1956, and\nthe respondents Nos. 1 and 2 will join the conveyance.\nOn execution of the sale deed, the appellant will be\nentitled to delivery of possession of land from the first\nand second respondents. In the event of respondents\nNo. 3 failing to execute the sale deed or the first and\nsecond respondents failing to join the conveyance, the\n\n - 35 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nappellant shall be entitled to obtain the sale deed\nthrough the trial Court.

Lastly, it was urged before us that the High\nCourt should not have lightly interfered with the\nexercise of its discretion by the trial court to grant or not\nto grant specific performance on the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. It is clear that the discretion,\nas \nlaid down in\n \nSection 22\n of the old Act (corresponding\nto \nSection 20\n of the Act of 1963), is not to be exercised\narbitrarily but on sound and reasonable grounds \"guided\nby judicial principles so that it is capable of correction by\na Court of appeal\". It appeared, quite rightly, to the\nHigh Court that the trial court had gone completely\nastray in the exercise of its discretion on the footing that\nthe plaintiff respondent enjoyed an \"unfair advantage\"\n\nover the first defendant-appellant, where as, on the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, it was the first\ndefendant who was placed in a position to exploit the\nneed of the plaintiff and the plaintiff's allegedly insecure\nposition under the first agreement. It is clear that the\nplaintiff-respondent had dealt very fairly and squarely\nwith the first defendant-appellant. The trial court's error\nin the exercise of its discretion on an utterly untenable,\nfanciful and unsound ground was rightly corrected by\nthe High Court.\"\n\n - 36 -\n\n \nNC: 2023:\nKHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nMademsetty Satyanarayana v.

The jurisdiction to decree specific\nperformance is discretionary, and the court is not bound\nto grant such relief merely because it is lawful to do so;\nbut the discretion of the court is not arbitrary but sound\nand reasonable guided by judicial principles and capable\nof correction by a court of appeal.\n\n The following are cases in which the court may\nproperly exercise a discretion not to decree specific\nperformance:\n\n I. Where the circumstances under which the\ncontract is made are such as to give the plaintiff an\nunfair advantage over the defendant, though there may\nbe no fraud or misrepresentation on the plaintiff's part.\n\n Illustrations\n\n ***\n II. Where the performance of the contract would\ninvolve some hardship on the defendant which he did\nnot foresee, whereas its non-performance would involve\nno such hardship on the plaintiff.\n\n Illustrations\n ***\n The following is a case in which the court may\nproperly exercise a discretion to decree specific\nperformance:\n\n - 37 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n III. Where the plaintiff has done substantial acts\n or suffered losses in consequence of a contract capable\n of specific performance.\n\n Illustrations\n ***\n \nThe First Schedule to the Limitation Act\n\nDescription of Period of Time from which\nsuit Limitation period begins to run\n\nArticle 113.\n For Three The date fixed for\nspecific years the performance, or,\nperformance of if no such date is\na contract fixed, when the\n plaintiff has notice\n that performance is\n refused.\n\n Under \nSection 22\n of the Specific Relief Act, relief\n of specific performance is discretionary but not arbitrary\n : discretion must be exercised in accordance with sound\n and reasonable judicial principles. The cases providing\n for a guide to courts to exercise discretion one way or\n other are only illustrative; they are not intended to be\n exhaustive. As \nArticle 113\n of the \nLimitation Act\n\n prescribes a period of 3 years from the date fixed\n thereunder for specific performance of a contract, it\n follows that mere delay without more extending up to\n the said period cannot possibly be a reason for a court\n to exercise its discretion against giving a relief of\n specific performance. Nor can the scope of the\n discretion, after excluding the cases mentioned in\n\n - 38 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nSection 22\n of the Specific Relief Act, be confined to\nwaiver, abandonment or estoppel. If one of these three\ncircumstances is established, no question of discretion\narises, for either there will be no subsisting right or\nthere will be a bar against its assertion. So, there must\nbe some discretionary field unoccupied by the three\ncases, otherwise the substantive section becomes\notiose. It is really difficult to define that field. Diverse\nsituations may arise which may induce a court not to\nexercise the discretion in favour of the plaintiff. It may\nbetter be left undefined except to state what the section\nsays, namely, discretion of the court is not arbitrary, but\nsound and reasonable guided by judicial principles and\ncapable of correction by a court of appeal.\n\n 7. Mr Lakshmaiah cited a long catena of English\ndecisions to define the scope of a court's discretion.\n\nBefore referring to them, it is necessary to know the\nfundamental difference between the two systems --\nEnglish and Indian -- qua the relief of specific\nperformance. In England the relief of specific\nperformance pertains to the domain of equity; in India,\nto that of statutory law. In England there is no period of\nlimitation for instituting a suit for the said relief and,\ntherefore, mere delay -- the time lag depending upon\ncircumstances -- may itself be sufficient to refuse the\nrelief; but, in India mere delay cannot be a ground for\nrefusing the said relief, for the statute prescribes the\nperiod of limitation. If the suit is in time, delay is\nsanctioned by law; if it is beyond time, the suit will be\ndismissed as barred by time; in either case, no question\nof equity arises.\n\n - 39 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n 8. With this background let us look at the English\ntext-books and decisions relied upon by the learned\ncounsel for the appellant. In Halsbury's Laws of England,\nVol. 36, at p. 324, it is stated:\n\n \"Where time is not originally of the essence of the\ncontract, and has not been made so by due notice, delay\nby a party in performing his part of the contract, or in\ncommencing or prosecuting the enforcement of his\nrights, may constitute such laches or acquiescence as\nwill debar him from obtaining specific performance. The\nextent of delay which has this effect varies with\ncircumstances, but as a rule must be capable of being\nconstrued as amounting to an abandonment of the\ncontract. A much shorter period of delay, however,\nsuffices if it is delay in declaring an option or exercising\nany other unilateral right; and if the other party has\nalready given notice that he does not intend to perform\nthe contract, the party aggrieved must take proceedings\npromptly if he desires to obtain specific performance.\"\n\n In Fly on Specific Performance, 6th Edn., at p.\n517, it is said:\n\n \"Where one party to the contract has given notice\nto the other that he will not perform it, acquiescence in\nthis by the other party, by a comparatively brief delay in\nenforcing his right, will be a bar : so that in one case\ntwo years' delay in filing a bill after such notice, in\nanother case one year's delay, and in a third (where the\ncontract was for a lease of collieries) five months' delay\nwas held to exclude the intervention of the Court.\"\n\n - 40 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n Learned counsel cited many English decisions in\nsupport of his argument that there shall be promptitude\nand diligence in enforcing a claim for specific\nperformance after a repudiation of the contract by the\nother party and that mere continual claim without any\nactive steps will not keep alive the right which would\notherwise be defeated by laches :\n\nsee Clegg v. Edmondson [(1857) 114 RR 336]\n, Eads v. Williams [(1854) 43 ER Chan 671]\n, Lehmann v. McArthur [(1968) LR 3 Ch AC 496]\n, Watsoh v. Reid [(1830) 39 ER Chan 91] , and Emile\nErlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Company [(1878)\nLR 3 AC 1218] . But as stated earlier, the English\nprinciples based upon mere delay can have no\napplication in India where the statute prescribes the\ntune for enforcing the claim for specific performance.\nBut another class of cases which dealt with the doctrine\nof laches have some bearing in the Indian context.\nIn Lindsay Petroleum Company v. Prosper Armstrong\nHurd, Abram Farewell, and John Kemp [(1874) LR 5 PCA\n221, 239-240] Sir Barnes Peacock defined the doctrine\nthus:\n\n \"Where it would be practically unjust to give a\nremedy, either because the party has, by his conduct,\ndone that which might fairly be regarded as equivalent\nto a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and neglect he\nhas, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put\nthe other party in a situation in which it would not be\nreasonable to place him if the remedy were afterwards\nto be asserted, in either of these cases, lapse of time\nand delay are most material.\"\n\n - 41 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n This passage indicates that either waiver or\nconduct equivalent to waiver along with delay may be a\nground for refusing to give a decree for specific\nperformance. In Caesar Lamare v. Thomas\nDixon [(1873) 6 HLC 414, 423] Lord Chelmsford said:\n\n \"The conduct of the party applying for relief is\nalways an important element for consideration.\"\n\n The House of Lords in Emile Erlanger v. New\nSombrero Phosphate Company [(1878) LR 3 AC 1218]\napproved the passage in Lindsay Petroleum\nCompany v. Prosper Armstrong Hurd, Abram Farewell,\nand John Kemp [(1874) LR 5 PCA 221, 239-240] which\nwe have extracted earlier.\n\n \n11. The result of the aforesaid discussion of the\ncase law may be briefly stated thus : While in England\nmere delay or laches may be a ground for refusing to\ngive a relief of specific performance, in India mere delay\nwithout such conduct on the part of the plaintiff as\nwould cause prejudice to the defendant does not\nempower a court to refuse such a relief. But as in\nEngland so in India, proof of abandonment or waiver of\na right is not a pre-condition necessary to disentitle the\nplaintiff to the said relief, for if abandonment or waiver\nis established, no question of discretion on the part of\nthe Court would arise. We have used the expression\n\"waiver\" in its legally accepted sense, namely, \"waiver is\ncontractual, and may constitute a cause of action : it is\nan agreement to release or not to assert a right\";\nsee \nDawson's Bank Ltd. v. Nippon Menkwa Kabushiki\nKaisha\n [(1935) LR 62 IA 100, 108] . It is not possible or\n\n - 42 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ndesirable to lay down the circumstances under which a\ncourt can exercise its discretion against the plaintiff. But\nthey must be such that the representation by or the\nconduct or neglect of the plaintiff is directly responsible\nin inducing the defendant to change his position to his\nprejudice or such as to bring about a situation when it\nwould be inequitable to give him such a relief.\n\n 12. Bearing these principles in mind let us now\nlook at the facts of the case. Both the lower courts found\nthat the appellant repudiated the contract even on the\nnext day of the auction i.e. August 24, 1954. The 1st\nrespondent issued a notice to the appellant on August\n30, 1954, asking him to obtain from him one-fourth of\nthe auction price as earnest money at any time within\n24 hours and the balance within a period of one week\nthereafter and execute a sale deed in his favour. The\nappellant did not reply to this notice. The 1st respondent\nin his evidence says that he could not take effective\nsteps to enforce the contract for a period of 7 months as\nhis wife was ill and as the Hyderabad Municipal\nCorporation had demolished one of his houses. The High\nCourt accepted the explanation given by the 1st\nrespondent for the delay in his taking steps in enforcing\nthe contract. In the affidavit filed by the 1st respondent\nin the trial court on October 18, 1955, he stated that his\nhouse had been demolished by the Municipal\nCorporation before a year and a half and his wife was\nalso seriously ill for the \"last two years\" and that,\ntherefore, he was worried. From this statement it is\nargued that both the circumstances which are said to\n\n - 43 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nhave been the reasons for the delay were in existence\neven before the auction and, therefore, the High Court\nwent wrong in accepting the explanation of the 1st\nrespondent for the delay. It is true that the 1st\nrespondent's wife was ill even before the auction, but\nshe continued to be ill even after the auction and there\nis clear evidence that she was being treated in a\nhospital. This continual illness of the 1st respondent's\nwife must have unnerved him and when the High Court\naccepted his evidence we cannot say that it went wrong.\nIt is also true that the notice by the Municipal\nCorporation to demolish the house was given two\nmonths prior to the auction, but there is nothing on the\nrecord to show when the house was actually\ndemolished. Some time must have elapsed between the\nnotice and the actual demolition. The only evidence in\nregard to the demolition of the house is that of the 1st\nrespondent; and it is not suggested in the cross-\nexamination that the demolition of the house was before\nthe auction. On the uncontradicted evidence of the 1st\nrespondent, we must hold, agreeing with the High\nCourt, that the 1st respondent was in a worried state of\nmind because of the said two circumstances which might\nhave been responsible, to some extent, for his not\ntaking immediate active and effective steps to enforce\nhis right. The most important circumstance in the case\nis, when did the 1st respondent come to know of the\ncommencement of the building operations by the\nappellant on the suit site? The 1st respondent says in\nhis evidence that 7 or 8 months after the auction he\npassed by the suit site and saw foundations had been\n\n - 44 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ndug therein and a few days thereafter he filed the suit.\nThe appellant, on the other hand, says in his evidence\nthat he started the construction after the disputed\nauction and that it was completed in 5 or 6 months.\nThough he says in the cross-examination that he applied\nto the Municipality for permission to build, he did not\nproduce either a copy of that application or the sanction\nissued to him by the Municipality. He is not even\nprepared to deny that he got the sanction only in March\n1955. The trial court surmised without any evidence that\nat the time the 1st respondent saw the foundations the\nstage of the construction indicated that the building\noperations must have commenced two months earlier.\nThe High Court rightly pointed out that it was a pure\nsurmise and accepted the evidence of the 1st\nrespondent that a few days after he saw the foundations\nbeing dug in the suit site he filed the suit. But all these\nare beside the point, for it is not the case of the\nappellant that because of the 1st respondent's conduct\nhe was induced to put up the building at a heavy cost :\n\nhis case throughout was that there was no contract at\nall. If so, there was no question of his being induced to\nact to his detriment because of the conduct of the 1st\nrespondent. Therefore, except for some delay, there are\nno circumstances within the meaning of the aforesaid\ndecisions which should induce a court to refuse in its\ndiscretion to give a relief of specific performance. The\nHigh Court rightly held that it was a fit case where the\nplaintiff should have been given a relief of specific\nperformance.\n\n - 45 -\n\n \nNC: 2023:\nKHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nB.

Even after finding and holding that the\ndefendant had failed to perform his part of the contract\ninasmuch as he had failed to discharge the aforesaid\nthree obligations cast upon him under the agreement to\nsell, the plaintiff, in order to succeed in this suit for\nspecific performance, has to aver and prove that he has\nalways been ready and willing to perform the essential\nterms of the contract which are to be performed by him\nand this is the requirement of\n S.16(c)\n of the Specific\nRelief Act, 1963. In other words, the aforesaid\nrequirement of law has to be proved by the plaintiff\nnotwithstanding the aforesaid default on the part of the\ndefendant in respect of the performance of the\nobligations cast upon him. The averments of continuous\nreadiness and willingness to perform the essential terms\nof the contract in question are set out in the plaint and\n\n - 46 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nnow the only question to be answered and which forms\nthe subject-matter of issue No.1 is the continuous\nreadiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff to\nperform his part of the contract and the only essential\nterm of the contract to be performed by the plaintiff is\nthe payment of the balance price at the time of the\nexecution and the registration of the sale deed by the\ndefendant. The question of payment of balance price\ncould occur only after the defendant had got the sale\npermission from the D.D.A. as also the income-tax\nclearance certificate and the vacant possession of the\nhouse in question from his tenant. The stage of the\npayment of the balance price never arose in this case on\naccount of the failure on the part of the defendant in the\nmatter of performance of his part of the contract. The\nrequirement of law is simply the continuous readiness\nand willingness on the part of the plaintiff to perform his\npart of the contract throughout from the\ncommencement of the agreement to sell till the hearing\nof the suit but that does not mean that the plaintiff was\nexpected to carry on the cash balance price of\nRs.1,45,000/- in his pocket during all the aforesaid\nperiod, but what he was to show was simply his\ncontinuous readiness and willingness to pay that balance\nprice only as and when the appropriate occasion for the\nsame was to arise. The expression \"readiness and\nwillingness\" cannot be treated as a strait- jacket formula\nand has to be determined from the totality of facts and\ncircumstances relevant to the case and also to the\nconduct of the party concerned and in order to be real\nhas to be backed by the capacity to do so.\n\n - 47 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n 17. In dealing with the conduct of the plaintiff one\nhas to look to the replies Exts. P11 to P13 sent by the\nplaintiff to the various notices of the defendant. In Ext.\nP11 dated 10-3-1980 and Ext. P12 dated 9-4-1980 the\nplaintiff not only denied the allegations of the defendant\ndoubting the financial capacity of the plaintiff to pay the\nbalance price of Rs. 1,45,000/- but further asserted his\nbeing in possession of ready money to purchase the\nproperty and to fulfil his part of the contract and further\ncalled upon the defendant to perform his part of the\ncontract and to get the necessary sale permission so that\nthe sale deed could be executed. Finally he also\nthreatened the defendant to file a suit in case the\ndefendant defaulted to comply with the same. Similarly\nthe plaintiff further threatened the defendant to bring\nlegal proceedings against him for specific performance of\nthe contract in case he failed to inform him within a\nweek of the receipt of the same that he had already\napplied for the grant of sale permission and was ready\nand willing to perform his part of the contract and to\nexecute the sale deed in his favour. It would be also\nseen that the plaintiff gave in these notices only 7 days\ntime to the defendant to obtain the sale permission from\nthe D.D.A. and not unreasonably long time so as to\nevince an intention on the part of the plaintiff that he\nwas trying to dodge the defendant and was not\ninterested in the finalisation of the sale transaction. On\nthe other hand, the above mentioned assertions and\ndenials on the part of the plaintiff in Ext. P11 to Ext. P13\n\n - 48 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ngo to show his keenness for the finalisation of the sale.\nThe plaintiff's having immediately returned the affidavit\nsent to him by the defendant for obtaining sale\npermission from D.D.A., after completing the same still\ngoes to strengthen the aforesaid inference in favour of\nthe plaintiff, notwithstanding the aforesaid assertions on\nthe part of the plaintiff the defendant, under a lame\nexcuse, as already pointed out above, withdrew his\napplication for the grant of sale permission from the\nD.D.A. The story about the plaintiff having expressed his\nincapacity to pay the balance sale price on the\n'namkaran' ceremony of the defendant's nephew and\nwanting a further period of about six months to enable\nhim to arrange the same, has already been found to be\ndubious especially when there was no occasion for the\nsame in view of the defendant not having performed his\npart of the contract.\n\n 19. The conclusion about the plaintiff having been\nalways ready and willing to perform his part of the\ncontract in respect of the payment of the balance price is\nsupported on a number of authorities. In Bank of India\nLtd. v. Jamsetji A.H. Chinoy. Chinoy and Co., AIR 1950\nPC 90 (at p. 96) it was observed as follows:--\n\n \".........It is true that plaintiff 1 stated that he was\n buying for himself, that he had not sufficient\n ready money to meet the price and that no\n definite arrangements had been made for\n finding it at the time of repudiation. But in\n order to prove himself ready and willing a\n\n - 49 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n purchaser has not necessarily to produce the\n money or to vouch a concluded scheme for\n financing the transaction. The question is one\n of fact and in the present case the appellate\n Court had ample material on which to found\n the view it reached.\"\n\n Their Lordships of the Privy Council then\n added to concur with Chagla A.C.J. whose\n observations run as under:--\n\n \"In my opinion, on the evidence already on record\n it was sufficient for the Court to come to the\n conclusion that plaintiff 1 was ready and willing\n to perform his part of the contract. It was not\n necessary for him to work out actual figures\n and satisfy the Court what specific amount a\n bank would have advanced on the mortgage of\n his property and the pledge of these shares. I\n do not think that any jury -- if the matter was\n left to the jury in England -- would have come\n to the conclusion that a man, in the position in\n which the plaintiff was, was not ready and\n willing to pay the purchase price of the shares\n which he had bought from defendants 1 and\n\n 2.\"\n\n 18. The testimony of the plaintiff as PW 1 shows that\nhe was prepared to pay the entire balance price agreed\nupon even at the time of the execution of the agreement\nto sell Ext. P2 and since then up-till now he had been\nprepared to pay the same. The authenticity of this\nassertion in his testimony finds full support from the fact\n\n - 50 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nthat he had actually brought in Court a sum of Rs.\n1,60,000/- and was prepared to pay it to the defendant at\nthat time and this cash amount he had brought in Court\neven on the previous date of hearing, as stated by him in\nhis cross-examination which was not challenged. His\ncross-examination shows that up-till 25-2-1980 there was\na sum of Rs. 70,000/-belonging to him in his firm M/s.\nLakshmi Paper Mart and another sum of Rs. 11,000/- in\nhis wife's name in that very firm and further that he had\njewellery also at his house. He has further deposed that\napproximately a sum of Rs. 75,000/- was lying in the said\nfirm in his name on 29-9-1979, the date of the\nagreement to sell in question. He further goes on to say\nthat the aforesaid amounts in his name as also in the\nname of his wife in the said firm were continuing and the\namount in his name must have swollen to Rs. 80,000/-\napproximately. Regarding the cash amount of Rs.\n1,60,000/- having been brought by him in Court during\nthe course of his testimony he stated that he had brought\nthis cash amount from his aforesaid firm and his brothers.\nThe aforesaid facts would certainly go to prove the\ncontinuous readiness and willingness on the part of the\nplaintiff to perform his part of the contract, i.e., the\npayment of the balance price at the appropriate time as\nand when it could come about and the contention of the\nlearned counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff had\nnot brought the account books of his firm nor the income-\ntax return for the year 1979-80 and for which reason his\naforesaid testimony ought not to be believed, cannot be\naccepted. The plaintiff was bold enough to assert in his\ncross-examination that he sent his income-tax returns\n\n - 51 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nevery year and that the income-tax return for the year\n1979-80 included his aforesaid deposits. The agreement\nto sell was executed on 29-9-1979 and the plaintiff stated\nthat on that day a sum of Rs. 75,000/- approximately\nwould be lying in his aforesaid firm in his name. He\nconceded that he had not brought the books of account\npertaining to that day but hastened to assert that if it was\nsought he would bring the same also, and thereafter the\ndefendant did not muster courage to request for the\nproduction of the same in Court by the plaintiff. His\nbringing in Court a cash amount of Rs. 1,60,000/- is\nconvincingly sufficient to dispel the contentions of the\nlearned counsel for the defendant regarding the\ncontinuous readiness and willingness on the part of the\nplaintiff to perform his part of the contract regarding his\nability to pay the balance price at the appropriate time as\nand when it could come and this inference is fortified from\nthe plaintiff's conduct asserted in his notices Exts. P11 to\nP13 also referred to above. It could not be difficult for\nhim to arrange the money from his said firm and his\nbrother. However, he was under no obligation to show the\ncash amount or a bank draft in the sum of Rs. 1,45,000/-\nto the defendant who had failed to perform his part of the\ncontract and that demand on the part of the defendant in\nhis notices sent to the plaintiff was unwarranted and\ntotally premature.\n\n 20. \nIn \nRamesh Chandra Chandiok v.

R informed A by letter dated 11-8-1955\nthat the sale deed would be executed by him only after\nrequired sanction and further undertook to inform A as\nsoon as the sanction was obtained. R, however, never\ntook any steps till 11-11-1956 to apply for sanction but\non the other hand informed A that he was not willing to\nwait indefinitely for want of sanction and that if the rest\nof the consideration was not paid within a week, the\nearnest money would be forfeited and the agreement\ncancelled. Even though R applied for and obtained the\nrequired sanction on 20-11-1956, he did not inform A\nabout it and cancelled the contract.

It was\nobserved as follows:--\n\n \"....Be that as it may R could not call upon A to\n complete the sale and pay the balance money\n until the undertaking given in Exhibit P-7 dated\n 11-8-1955 (regarding sanction) had been\n fulfilled by R. The sanction was given in\n November 1956 and even then R did not inform\n A about it so as to enable A to perform its part\n of the agreement of sale..........\"\n\nIt was also held as follows:--\n\n - 53 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n \"On the facts and circumstances of the case A must\n be held to be ready and willing to perform his\n part of the contract till date of suit and was\n therefore entitled to a decree for specific\n performance. Readiness and willingness cannot\n be treated as a strait-jacket formula. These have\n to be determined from the entirety of facts and\n circumstances relevant to the intention and\n conduct of the party concerned. There was no\n material on record to show that A at any stage\n was not ready and willing to perform his part of\n contract or that he did not have the necessary\n funds for payment when the sale deed would be\n executed after the sanction was obtained.........\"\n\n 29. Thus, in view of the aforesaid discussions, I\nhold that the plaintiff has always been ready and willing\nto perform his part of the contract and the defendant\nhad failed to perform his part of the contract, and both\nthese issues are decided in favour of the plaintiff and\nagainst the defendant.\n\n 30. In view of my findings in issues 1 and 2, I\npass a decree for the specific performance of the\nagreement of sale in question dated 29-9-1979 with\ncosts in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant\nand the defendant is directed to do all acts necessary,\nviz., (i) to obtain the sale permission from the D.D.A.\n\n(ii) to obtain the income-tax clearance certificate and\n\n(iii) to put the plaintiff into full actual physical\n\n - 54 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n possession of the house in question.

This special leave petition arises from the\n judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of\n Madras made on 12-6-1996 in LPA No. 72 of 1991. The\n petitioner had filed OS No. 6 of 1977 on 10-9-1980\n before the Second Additional Sub-Judge at Pondicherry\n for specific performance of the agreement of sale dated\n 18-10-1976 to convey the property in possession as\n tenants under the agreement. It is their case that a sum\n of Rs 31,000 was sale consideration and a sum of Rs\n 4000 and odd was paid as part consideration. The\n balance consideration was Rs 28,500. He was always\n ready and willing to perform his part of the contract but\n the respondents were avoiding to execute the sale deed.\n Though the trial court found that Respondents 1 and 2\n\n - 55 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ncommitted breach of the agreement of sale but denied\nto them specific performance of the agreement on the\nground that Respondent 3 was a bona fide purchaser for\nvalue without notice of prior agreement with the\npetitioner. The petitioner filed the appeal in the High\nCourt. Pending appeal, he died. Therefore, his legal\nrepresentatives have come on record. The learned\nSingle Judge by judgment and decree dated 11-9-1980\nagreed with those findings and held that the 3rd\nrespondent was a bona fide purchaser without notice of\nthe agreement. In the impugned judgment, the Division\nBench rejected the claim on the additional ground that\nthe plaintiff did not come to the Court with clean hands.\nTherefore, he is disentitled to relief of specific\nperformance. Under \nSection 20\n of the Specific Relief Act,\n1963, (for short \"the Act\") the decree for specific\nperformance is in the discretion of the court but the\ndiscretion should not be refused arbitrarily. The\ndiscretion should be exercised on sound principles of law\ncapable of correction by an appellate court.\n\n 2. It is settled law that the party who seeks to avail\n\nof the equitable jurisdiction of a court and specific\n\nperformance being equitable relief, must come to the\n\ncourt with clean hands. In other words the party who\n\nmakes false allegations does not come with clean hands\n\nand is not entitled to the equitable relief. The Division\n\nBench has pointed out in the judgment three grounds\n\nwhich disentitle the plaintiff to the equitable relief as he\n\n - 56 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ncame with a positive case of incorrect and false facts as\n\nset out in paras 4 to 6 thus:\n\n \"On a perusal of the records we are\n entirely in agreement with the view\n expressed by the learned Judge. It is quite\n clear that the plaintiff has not come to Court\n with clean hands. There are three\n circumstances which are pointed out by the\n learned Judge and we find that they are\n sufficient to warrant refusal of the claim for\n specific performance. First is that the\n plaintiff claimed that he was already in\n possession of Door No. 2/53 as a lessee and\n he was given possession of Door No. 1/53 on\n the date of the agreement itself, viz., 18-10-\n 1976 by Defendants 1 and 2. But, in the\n course of evidence he did not say anything\n about taking possession pursuant to the sale\n agreement. On the contrary, he deposed\n falsely that he did not mention in the plaint\n about getting possession of Door No. 1/53\n on 18-10-1976. It is mentioned in the\n evidence that Door No. 1/53 was not given\n to the plaintiff at any time in December\n 1976. The tenant who was occupying the\n said portion has vacated the same and gave\n possession to Defendants 1 and 2 who in\n turn handed over the same to the third\n defendant. Thus, the case of the plaintiff\n regarding possession of Door No. 1/53 is\n\n - 57 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nfalse. Learned counsel contends that there\nwas no mention in the plaint as to the date\non which he took possession of Door No.\n1/53. This contention is not correct. In para\n5 of the plaint it is mentioned specifically\nthat in pursuance of the agreement, the\nplaintiff who was in possession of Item 2 was\ngiven possession of Item 1 on that date and\nthat he was in possession of both the items\nsince then under the agreement dated 18-\n10-1976. This plea is clearly false. DW 3 who\nwas occupying Door No. 1/53 has given\nevidence that the portion was vacated on\n12-12-1976 by his father by taking a sum of\nRs 2500 from the prior owner. The plaintiff\nhas himself stated as PW 1 that the tenant\ndelivered possession to the owner of the\nproperty on 15-12-1976. That relied his case\nthat he had taken possession even on the\ndate of agreement viz., 18-10-1976. But, in\nanother place PW 1 has stated that the\ntenant of Door No. 1/53 vacated the portion\non 5-12-1976. Thus, his evidence is not only\nfalse, but also discrepant.\n\n 5. The second circumstance is that the\nplaintiff has made an express allegation in\nparas 7 and 9 of the plaint that he informed\nthe third defendant in the first week of\nDecember 1976 about the agreement when\nthe third defendant inspected the house for\n\n - 58 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n the purpose of purchasing the same. This\n plea is also false. PW 1 has not chosen to\n make a whisper about this in his\n deposition. On the other hand, it is\n contended that there is no denial of the\n said allegation in the written statement but\n it is not correct. In the written statement,\n the third defendant has clearly stated that\n at no time he had any talk with the plaintiff\n and he was never informed about the\n agreement with the plaintiff.\n\n 6. The third circumstance is that the\n plaintiff claimed that he had paid a sum of\n Rs 400 in addition to the sum of Rs 4000\n paid as advance to the second defendant at\n the latter's request for vacating Door No.\n 1/53. In the deposition he had stated that\n he had mentioned the same in his plaint,\n but it is not so. It is also a false plea as\n found correctly by the learned Judge. The\n above three circumstances are sufficient to\n uphold the refusal of specific performance.\n It has been held by this Court repeatedly\n that a person who has come to court with a\n false plea is not entitled to the equitable\n relief of specific performance.\"\n\n 3. In addition, the Division Bench also agreed with\nthe learned Single Judge and held that the third\nrespondent had no knowledge whatever of the plaintiff's\nagreement and, therefore, he was a bona fide purchaser\n\n - 59 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n for value without notice. This is a concurrent finding of\n fact after appreciation of evidence. It would thus be\n seen that on both the grounds, the courts below rightly\n refused to exercise the discretion on legal principles to\n grant specific performance. It does not, therefore,\n warrant interference.\"\n\n36. In view of the above arguments putforth on behalf of the\n\nparties and the material evidence available on record, in the\n\nbackground of the legal principles enunciated in the aforesaid\n\ndecisions, the following points would arise for consideration:\n\n (i) Whether the plaintiff has made out a case for\n grant of decree of specific performance?\n\n (ii) Whether the plaintiff has successfully\n established that he was always ready and\n willing to perform his portion of the contract?\n\n (iii) Whether defendants 2 and 3 establish before\n the Court that they are the bonafide\n purchasers of suit property for value, as such,\n they are not liable for repayment of earnest\n money and damages?\n\n (iv) Whether the impugned judgment is suffering\n from legal infirmity and perversity and thus\n calls for interference?\n\n (v) What Order?\n - 60 -\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n37. Regarding Point Nos.1 to 4:In the case on hand, first\n\ndefendant flatly denied the very execution of suit agreement\n\nmarked at Ex.P.1. However, the cross-examination of D.W.1\n\nand the cross examination made by counsel for first defendant\n\nto P.W.1 on cumulative consideration would sufficiently\n\nestablish that suit agreement stands proved. The signature\n\nfound on Ex.P.1 on all pages is admitted by D.W.1 stating that\n\nit is his signature and he has also put the date on Ex.P.1 which\n\nis dated 18.10.1995. First defendant is an Ayurvedic Doctor\n\nand therefore, it should not lie in the mouth of first defendant\n\nthat he has subscribed his signature on blank document which\n\nhas been misused by the plaintiff for concocting the suit\n\nagreement marked at Ex.P.1. Since Ex.P.1 stands proved as\n\nper judgment of the Trial Court, and in the absence of any\n\nchallenge made by the first defendant by filing a cross objection\n\nor supporting the cross-objection filed by defendants 2 and 3\n\nbefore this Court, and having remained absent before this\n\nCourt, it is to be held that suit agreement stands proved by the\n\nplaintiff. Consequently, payment of Rs.55,000/- as advance\n\nsale consideration made by plaintiff to the first defendant also\n\n - 61 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nstands proved. Hence detailed discussion insofar as proof of\n\nsuit agreement is necessary in this appeal.\n\n38. However, according to P.W.1, he has paid a further sum\n\nof Rs.40,000/- on 07.11.1995 at the request of first defendant.\n\nIn this regard, except oral testimony of P.W.1 there is no\n\nevidence placed on record. When a sum of Rs.55,000/- is paid\n\nby plaintiff to first defendant and same has been entered in the\n\nagreement of sale, why would the plaintiff make payment to\n\nfirst defendant within a short span of time in a sum of\n\nRs.40,000/- that too without taking documentary proof thereof\n\nis a question that remains unanswered by the plaintiff.\n\n39. No explanation whatsoever is forthcoming on record in\n\nthe oral testimony of the plaintiff in this regard except a vague\n\nsentence is found in plaint as to non taking the document which\n\nwould evidence the payment of additional sum of Rs.40,000/-.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that in the notice which is marked at\n\nEx.P.2, no such explanation is forthcoming. While drafting the\n\nplaint, however, plaintiff has chosen to explain that defendant\n\npromised that he would adjust the additional sum of\n\nRs.40,000/- in the balance sale consideration. Therefore,\n\n - 62 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nplaintiff did not insist for any documentary proof insofar as\n\nadditional payment of Rs.40,000/- is concerned.\n\n40. Fact remains that the agreement is dated 18.10.1995 and\n\nlegal notice came to be issued on 20.11.1995. Within such\n\nshort span of time, how can plaintiff make number demands for\n\nexecution of sale deed is also a question that remains\n\nunanswered by the plaintiff. Admittedly, two months' time was\n\nno doubt stipulated in Ex.P.1 for completion of sale transaction.\n\n41. The sale deed executed in favour of defendants 2 and 3\n\nby the first defendant is dated 27.11.1995. In this regard,\n\nthere is sufficient force in the argument canvassed on behalf of\n\nplaintiff that after receipt of notice Ex.P.2, first defendant has\n\nexecuted sale deed in favour of defendants 2 and 3. In this\n\nregard, material evidence placed on record would go to show\n\nthat there was an agreement of sale dated 08.09.1995 which is\n\nalmost 40 days earlier to the execution of Ex.P.1. According to\n\nplaintiff, Ex.D.1 which is the agreement entered into by\n\ndefendant No.1 in favour of defendants 2 and 3 is a concoction\n\n - 63 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nand it is only to defeat the rights of the plaintiff in respect of\n\nthe suit agreement marked at Ex.P.1 dated 18.10.1995.\n\n42. As such, this Court perused Ex.D.1 in a meticulous\n\nmanner. Ex.D.1 is proved by defendants not only by examining\n\n2nd defendant, but also by examining one of the witnesses to\n\nEx.D.1 who is none other than the son-in-law of the first\n\npurchaser under Ex.D.2. He is examined as D.W.3, who, in his\n\nevidence has stated that he is an advocate and he has drafted\n\nExs.D.1 and D.2. It has also come in the evidence that D.W.3\n\nhas witnessed the sale consideration being passed on and the\n\nsame was paid through cheques from the bank account of the\n\nhusband of the first purchaser.\n\n43. These aspects of the matter would go to show that it is\n\nthe first defendant who is the mischief monger in the whole\n\ntransaction who has executed agreement with defendants 2\n\nand 3 on 08.09.1995 and he suppressed the said agreement\n\nwhen he entered into suit agreement with the plaintiff.\n\n44. In other words, it is plaintiff who is the second agreement\n\nholder or subsequent agreement holder in respect of suit\n\nproperty. Agreement of defendants 2 and 3 with defendant\n\n - 64 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nNo.1 is first in time. Therefore, contentions urged on behalf of\n\nplaintiff that defendants 2 and 3 cannot be construed as\n\nbonafide purchaser for value, cannot be countenanced in law.\n\n45. The contents of Exs.D.1 and D.2 on comparison would\n\nclearly corroborated each other and compliment to each other\n\ninasmuch as in the sale deed which is marked at Ex.P.2\n\nexecuted by first defendant in favour of defendants 2 and 3,\n\nthere is a mention about suit agreement and the date of the\n\nagreement is also mentioned as 08.09.1995.\n\n46. It is pertinent to note that while cross-examining the first\n\ndefendant, except suggesting that first defendant in active\n\ncollusion with defendants 2 and 3 has concocted the document,\n\nno other question is put to first defendant as to why he\n\nsuppressed the said agreement while executing the suit\n\nagreement.\n\n47. These aspects of the matter when viewed cumulatively in\n\nrespect of the suit property, depicts that defendants 2 and 3\n\nhave contracted to purchase the suit property on 08.09.1995\n\nand ultimately culminated in execution of the sale deed by the\n\n - 65 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nfirst defendant in favour of defendants 2 and 3 vide Ex.D.2.\n\nFirst defendant might have thought that if property is sold in\n\nfavour of defendants 2 and 3 he would be absolved from his\n\nliability to execute the sale deed in favour of the plaintiff.\n\nTherefore, principally the remedy for plaintiff is against\n\ndefendant No.1.\n\n48. Furthermore, since the property is sold to the 2nd and 3rd\n\ndefendant by first defendant on 27.11.1995, the suit which\n\ncame to be filed by plaintiff on 11.12.1995 after coming to\n\nknow of the reply notice initially against first defendant and\n\nsubsequently amending plaint averments and impleading\n\ndefendants 2 and 3 to the suit would go to show that plaintiff\n\nbeing deceived by first defendant was entitled to have remedy\n\nonly against first defendant at the first instance.\n\n49. Be it what it may, fact remains that the sale in favour of\n\ndefendants 2 and 3 by first defendant being in pursuance of the\n\nagreement dated 08.09.1995, the said sale is to be held as a\n\nproper sale.\n\n - 66 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n50. Having said so, it is settled principles of law and requires\n\nno emphasis that the liability on the property, if any, would\n\npass on with the property. No doubt, while passing the decree,\n\nlearned Trial Judge has ordered for refund of Rs.55,000/- with\n\ninterest at 6% per annum. However, the learned Trial Judge\n\nhas also directed to pay additional sum of Rs.55,000/- as\n\ndamages with interest at 6% per annum. The reason for\n\nordering damages by the Trial Court in a additional sum of\n\nRs.55,000/- is based on clause No.9 of Ex.P.1. P.W.1, in his\n\ncross-examination has flatly denied clause No.9 of Ex.P.1.\n\n51. It is the evidence of P.W.1 that he is the person who\n\ninstructed the stamp vendor to prepare Ex.P.1 and stamp\n\nvendor prepared the contents of Ex.P.1 based on the\n\ninstructions given by P.W.1 himself. When P.W.1 has flatly\n\ndenied clause 9, the learned Trial Judge directing that sum of\n\nRs.55,000/- is to be paid as damages based on clause 9 and\n\npenalizing defendants 2 and 3 insofar as damages is concerned\n\nis thus incorrect and needs interference by this Court.\n\n - 67 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n52. However, since the first defendant has not challenged the\n\ndecree insofar as first defendant is concerned, the decree\n\npassed by the Trial Court needs no interference.\n\n53. Further, there cannot be any dispute as to principles of\n\nlaw enunciated in the decisions relied on by counsel for\n\nappellant or respondents.\n\n54. In the case of Durga Prasad supra, their Lordships of the\n\nApex Court were of the opinion that subsequent transferee\n\nunder the conveyance outstanding in his favour having paid the\n\npurchase money when succeeds, what is the proper form of the\n\ndecree. In the case of hand, since the defendants have got an\n\nagreement in their favour on 08.09.1995, they cannot be\n\ntermed as subsequent transferee and therefore, same is not\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case.\n\n55. \nIn the case of \nRamesh Chandra Chandiok\n supra, their\n\nLordships of the Apex Court ruled as to how discretion for grant\n\nof specific performance must be exercised. Again, having\n\nregard to the facts and circumstances of the case, since\n\ndefendant Nos.2 and 3 are to be treated as earlier agreement\n\n - 68 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nholders, they cannot be termed as third party vis-à-vis, plaintiff\n\nand hence, said judgment is not applicable to the facts of the\n\ncase.\n\n56. \nIn the case of \nAbdul Kayum Ahmad\n supra, their Lordships\n\nhad taken into consideration \nSection 12(c)\n and \n21(a)\n of the\n\nSpecific Relief Act, and dealt with benefit of the promisor so as\n\nto exercise discretion in his favour for specific performance.\n\nThey also ruled that subsequent purchaser cannot claim to take\n\nup cudgels for the original promisor. The said decision is also\n\nof no use to the appellant/plaintiff inasmuch as it is the\n\ndefendants who are the agreement holders first in time.\n\n57. \nIn \nPrakash Chandra\n's case supra, the Court dealt with\n\nordinary rule of specific performance in granting decree of\n\nspecific performance and refusal should end up in damages\n\nwhich should constitute adequate relief.\n\n58. \nIn the case on hand, since the defendant Nos.2 and 3 are\n\nthe prior agreement holders than that of the appellant and the\n\nsame is established by placing necessary evidence on record,\n\nPrakash Chandra\n supra cannot be taken advantage by the\n\n - 69 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nplaintiff. Further, this Court is now enhancing the interest rate\n\nfrom 6% to 12% which should meet the interest of the\n\nappellant and he has been adequately satisfied.\n\n59. \nIn \nM. L. Devender Singh\n case supra, dealt with the\n\ndiscretion of the Trial Court in grant or otherwise of the specific\n\nperformance in the given set of circumstances. In the said\n\nruling, the Apex Court ruled that the Trial Court in such\n\ncircumstances, while exercising discretion, should not exercise\n\ndiscretion arbitrarily but on the sound and reasonable grounds\n\nguided by judicial principles.\n\n60. In the impugned judgment, learned Trial Judge has\n\nrightly applied the said guidance while ordering refund of\n\nmoney in the facts and circumstances of the case.\n\n61. \nIn the case of \nMademsetty Satyanarayana\n supra, the\n\nCourt dealt with \nSection 22\n of the Specific Relief Act and has\n\nruled as to how the Court should exercise its discretion and also\n\ndealt with the \nLimitation Act\n and the time for completion of the\n\ncontract. The said decision can also be distinguished on facts\n\n - 70 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nwith regard to the present case and therefore, same is not of\n\nany avail in advancing the case of the appellant further.\n\n62. \nIn the case of \nB. R. Rangaswamy\n's supra, this Court held\n\nthat when the agreement is proved, subsequent agreement to\n\nsell in favour of the plaintiff are doubtful, Court should order for\n\nspecific performance in favour of the earlier agreement holder.\n\nInfact, said decision helps the defendants rather on plaintiff\n\ninasmuch as on 08.09.1995 there was an agreement entered\n\ninto by the first defendant in favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3.\n\n63. In Sant Lal's case, Delhi High Court, while dealing with\n\nthe grant of specific performance or otherwise, has dealt in\n\ndetail the principles of law that would govern the field of\n\nspecific performance and ultimately ruled that conditions have\n\nbeen satisfied by the defendants and therefore, sale deed is to\n\nbe executed. The facts of the said case are different from the\n\nfacts of the present case and therefore, same is not of any use\n\nin taking the case of the plaintiff further.\n\n64. \nIn the decision relied upon by the learned counsel for\n\nrespondent in the case of \nLourdu Mari David\n supra, Apex Court\n\n - 71 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\nwhile dealing with a situation about the equitable jurisdiction of\n\na Court, while grant specific performance, in para-2 referred to\n\nsupra, has clearly held that the Courts are to be guided by the\n\ncircumstances which would allow a plaintiff to have a decree or\n\nrejection thereof.\n\n65. Applying the principles of law enunciated in the case of\n\nLourdu Mari David\n supra to the case on hand, since the\n\ndefendant Nos.2 and 3 are the earlier agreement holders, they\n\nare entitled for decree of specific performance and therefore,\n\ndismissal of the suit of the plaintiff by the Trial Court is just and\n\nproper.\n\n66. Further, as discussed supra, since there is suppression of\n\nmaterial facts by the first defendant while entering into suit\n\nagreement on 18.10.1995 about the earlier agreement dated\n\n08.09.1995, principles of law enunciated in the decisions relied\n\non by the plaintiff will not be much avail in allowing the appeal\n\nprayer.\n\n67. Further, since the liability of payment of advance amount\n\nwith interest would pass on with the property, defendants 2\n\nand 3 are bound to satisfy the payment of Rs.55,000/- with\n\n - 72 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\ninterest at 6% per annum. However taking note of the fact\n\nthat amount was paid by plaintiff which was even denied by\n\nfirst defendant by denying Ex.P.1 and also taking note of the\n\nfact that immovable property would always appreciate, the\n\nimpugned judgment and decree needs modification insofar as\n\ninterest rate at 12% per annum instead of 6% per annum.\n\n68. However, if defendants 2 and 3 were to satisfy the decree\n\nof payment of Rs.55,000/- being advance sale consideration\n\nwith 12% interest per annum, by virtue of indemnity clause\n\nunder Ex.D.2, defendants 2 and 3 would always be entitled to\n\nrecover the said sum of money from the other assets of the\n\nfirst defendant.\n\n69. Insofar as damages are concerned, defendants 2 and 3\n\nbeing not a party to Ex.P.1 and their agreement is being earlier\n\nto suit agreement, they cannot be held liable for damages of\n\nRs.55,000/- as ordered by the learned Trial Judge. More so,\n\nwhen the plaintiff himself has denied clause 9 in Ex.P.1.\n\nTherefore, to that extent, the impugned judgment and decree\n\nneeds interference by this Court.\n\n - 73 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:41675\n\n RFA No. 2314 of 2007\n\n C/W RFA.CROB No. 17 of 2010\n\n70. In view of the foregoing discussion, point Nos.1 and 2 are\n\nanswered in the negative and, point Nos.3 and 4 partly in the\n\naffirmative.\n\n71. Regarding Point No.5: In view of the finding of this Court\n\non point Nos.1 to 4 as above, the following:\n\n ORDER\n\n (i) Appeal and Cross Objection are allowed in part.\n\n (ii) While modifying the decree of the Trial Court,\n plaintiff is entitled for refund of earnest money of\n Rs.55,000/- with 12% interest per annum payable\n by all defendants and Rs.55,000/- as damages\n recoverable by the plaintiff from first defendant\n only, with interest at 6% per annum.\n\n (iii) Cross Objection insofar as awarding damages of\n Rs.55,000/- payable by defendants 2 and 3 with\n 6% per annum is hereby set-aside.\n\n (iv) No order as to costs.\n\n Sd/-\n JUDGE\n\nkcm\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 31",

The question of payment of balance price\ncould occur only after the defendant had got the sale\npermission from the D.D.A. as also the income-tax\nclearance certificate and the vacant possession of the\nhouse in question from his tenant. The stage of the\npayment of the balance price never arose in this case on\naccount of the failure on the part of the defendant in the\nmatter of performance of his part of the contract. The\nrequirement of law is simply the continuous readiness\nand willingness on the part of the plaintiff to perform his\npart of the contract throughout from the\ncommencement of the agreement to sell till the hearing\nof the suit but that does not mean that the plaintiff was\nexpected to carry on the cash balance price of\nRs.1,45,000/- in his pocket during all the aforesaid\nperiod, but what he was to show was simply his\ncontinuous readiness and willingness to pay that balance\nprice only as and when the appropriate occasion for the\nsame was to arise. The expression \"readiness and\nwillingness\" cannot be treated as a strait- jacket formula\nand has to be determined from the totality of facts and\ncircumstances relevant to the case and also to the\nconduct of the party concerned and in order to be real\nhas to be backed by the capacity to do so."
