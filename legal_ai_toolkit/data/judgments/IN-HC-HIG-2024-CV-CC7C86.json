Memo No. 14/Court/02-11/2022 Ka 3463 dated 03.06.2022, issued by the\nPrincipal Secretary, Personnel, Administrative Reforms and Rajbhasa\nDepartment, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi, is under challenge in all\nthese writ petitions. Since common question of law is involved in all these\nmatters, therefore, they have been heard together and will be disposed of by\ncommon order.\n\nW.P. (S) No. 696 of 2023\n\n2. In W.P. (S) No. 696 of 2023 letter issued by the Under Secretary to the\nDepartment of Home, Prison and Disaster Management, Government of\nJharkhand addressed to the Additional Director General of Police (Karmik)\ndated 10.11.2022 (Annexure-5) is under challenge. By this letter, promotion\nto unreserved post of Dy. S.P, the post of Inspector of Police has been\ndeclared to be the Basic cadre, and seniority in this cadre is to be considered\nwhile granting promotion.\n\n3. To put it precisely, unreserved seats in the roster to the promotional posts\nhave been made open to members of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe,\nto be filled up by seniority.\n\n4. It is specifically argued in this case that all petitioners in this case were\nappointed initially to the post of Sub Inspector of Police. During course of\ntime, they were promoted from the rank of Sub Inspector of Police to the\npost of inspector of police. They were not promoted to the post of Inspector\nby virtue of merit, but on the basis of available vacancy in the roster point\nfor the reserved category of SC/ST. Had they been promoted on merit, then\nthe circular of the central Government as well as the ratio of R.K.\nSabharwal (supra) could have squarely covered the case. The post of\nInspector is not a Basic cadre post, as no direct appointment is made to this\npost. Indisputably this is a promotional post and in order to circumvent the\nsettled law, by virtue of the letter dated 10.11.2022, issued by the Under\nSecretary, Department of Home, Prison and Disaster Management,\nGovernment of Jharkhand (Annexure-5), the post of Inspector has been\ndeclared to be Basic cadre post. If this interpretation is accepted, it will\nresult in candidates who had availed the benefit of reservation, to again get\nthe benefit to the post under unreserved category, which is against the law\nas settled by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in R.K Sabharwal case.\n\n5. To avoid multiplicity, the service excerpts of the petitioners are put in the\nfollowing tabular chart:-\n\nSl. Name of Date of Category Date of\nNo. petitioners appointment as promotion as\nS.I. Inspector of\nPolice\n1 Ravi Kant Prasad 05.09.1994 General 14.05.2016\n2 Abid Khan 05.09.1994 General 24.04.2015\n3 Ajay Kumar 05.09.1994 General 24.04.2015\nKeshri\n4 Ajay Kumar 05.09.1994 General 14.05.2016\n\n6. Number of schedule tribe/schedule caste Sub Inspector, who were though\njuniors in rank, than the petitioners, got promotion to the post of Inspector\nof Police at an earlier point of time, taking the benefit of reservation under\n\nArticle 16(4)(a)\nof the Constitution, but on the post earmarked for reserved\ncategory. It is contended that the candidates belonging to the SC/ST\ncategory having twice taken benefit of reservation at the time of\nappointment, as well as at the time of promotion to the rank of Inspector.\nTherefore giving them preferential treatment in matter of promotion to the\npost of Dy.S.P will be against the ratio as laid down in\nDeepa E.V. v. Union\nof India\n, (2017) 12 SCC 680.\n\n7. It is argued that reference to the letters of the Government of India for\npromotion to unreserved roster point to those appointed on reservation is\nmisplaced, as none of these letters was for those members of Schedule\nCastes and Schedule Tribes, who had been appointed on reservation. These\nletters are with respect to those, who had been appointed on merit and,\ntherefore, their promotion to unreserved point was unquestioned.\n\n8. Further line of argument is that R.K. Sabharwal (supra) has been relied\nupon in the impugned notification, but the said Judgment does not permit\nthe promotion to the unreserved post, by one who has availed of reservation\nat any stage.\nAs a matter of fact, law is settled that once a candidate is\nappointed by seeking reservation under Schedule Castes and Schedule\nTribes category or relaxation, migration to general category is not\npermissible in view of the ratio laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin\nDeepa E.V. v. Union of India\n, (2017) 12 SCC 680.\n\n9. The appellant, who has applied under OBC category by availing age\nrelaxation and also attending the interview under the \"OBC category\"\n\ncannot claim right to be appointed under the General category.\n\n10. On a combined reading of Rule 9 of the Export Inspection Agency\n(Recruitment) Rules, 1980 and also the proceedings dated 1-7-1998, we\nfind that there is an express bar for the candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC\nwho have availed relaxation for being considered for general category\ncandidates.\n\nGaurav Pradhan v. State of Rajasthan\n, (2018) 11 SCC 352\n\n49. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered\nopinion that the candidates belonging to SC/ST/BC, who had taken\nrelaxation of age, were not entitled to be migrated to the unreserved\nvacancies; the State of Rajasthan has migrated such candidates who\nhave taken concession of age against the unreserved vacancies\nwhich resulted displacement of a large number of candidates who\nwere entitled to be selected against the unreserved category\nvacancies. The candidates belonging to unreserved category who\ncould not be appointed due to migration of candidates belonging to\nSC/ST/BC were clearly entitled for appointment which was denied to\nthem on the basis of the above illegal interpretation put by the State.\n\nW.P. (S) No.2189 of 2023\n\n11. In this case the Petitioners belong to the General (unreserved category) and\nwere appointed to the post of ' Training officer' on different dates during\nthe period 2011-2017.\n\n12. Under \"Jharkhand Industrial Training Service/cadre (appointment,\npromotion and service conditions of non-gazetted posts) Rules,2021\", the\npost of ' Chief Training Officer' is to be filled only by way of promotion\nfrom the substantive post of 'Training Officers' who had rendered a\nsatisfactory service for 5 years to the said post.\n\n13. But the resolution no. 1072 dated 17.02.2009, already 26%,10%,8% and,\n6% of promotional posts are earmarked for the employees belonging to the\nS.T , SC, EBC, and BC category respectively. The remaining 50% is meant\nfor the unreserved category.\n\n14. It is submitted by learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners that the letter\ndated 03.06.2022 bearing memo No. 3463 was not according to the\nJudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in R.K. Sabharwal (Supra) case.\nTherefore, any promotion granted to unreserved posts to the employees of\nreserved category, based on the impugned memo, was against settled law.\n\n15. Petitioner in W.P. (S) No. 3012 of 2022 is Assistant Engineer in the\nDepartment of Water Resources and was initially appointed as Junior\nEngineer (Technical) on 21.11.2007 and was promoted to the post of\nAssistant Engineer on 20.11.2018. He is also aggrieved by the impugned\nmemo which makes provision for the promotion from the reserved point\nroster to be promoted to the roster point for unreserved category.\n\n16. The Petitioner has rendered 3 years and 10 months of service on the post of\nAssistant Engineer. Minimum length of service for promotion from the post\nof Assistant Engineer to the post of Executive Engineer is 5 years as per the\nstate government resolution dated 16.01.2012. Promotion of private\nrespondent nos. 5 to 9 have been undertaken vide notification dated\n27.12.2022. These promotions have been made against unreserved roster\npoints by following the impugned government letter dated 03.06.2022.\n\n17. It is argued that the present case is not concerned with consequential\nseniority, it is also not concerned with the 85th Amendment of the\nConstitution of India. The case is about following the law laid down in the\nJudgment of R.K. Sabharwal case.\n\n18. Petitioners in W.P. (S) No.5217 of 2022 were appointed to the unreserved\npost of Junior Engineer through direct competitive examination conducted\nby Jharkhand Public Service Commission. They apprehend their prospect\nfor promotion to the rank of Assistant Engineer to be adversely affected in\nview of the impugned memo of the Govt. dated 03.06.2022. They claim to\nbe eligible for promotion to the post of Assistant Engineer having rendered\nmore than 5 years of regular service on the feeder post, and seek direction\nfor considering their case for promotion.\n\n19. It is contended that the provision of promotion from reserved to unreserved\nis against the ratio laid down by the Apex Court In R.K Sabharwal case\n(supra) and is also not in accord with the Government of India letter dated\n11.07.2002 as contained in office memorandum no.36028/17/2001\nEstt.(Res). The government of India specifically provides in the\nmemorandum, \"Only those persons, belonging to reserved category, are\nto be considered for promotion against unreserved vacancies, who have\nentered in the feeder grade on their own merit and not owing to any\nreservation or relaxation of qualification\".\n\n20. It is also argued that the impugned memo will result in excessive\nreservation, exceeding 50% ceiling as laid down in Indra Sawhney case.\n\nW.P. (S) No.3216 of 2022\n\n21. Impugned memo dated 03.06. 2022 is under challenge, wherein it has been\nprovided that promotion will be undertaken from reserved roster point seat\nto unreserved roster points vacancy in the matter of seniority-cum-fitness.\nFurther prayer is for direction to initiate the promotion process, on the basis\nof reserved to reserve and unreserved to unreserve.\n\n22. Petitioners were appointed by a common order in the same cadre and on the\nsame post under the unreserved category and were posted as Junior\nEngineer vide departmental order 3518 dated 14.11.2016, and they gave\ntheir joining. The impugned order has been issued at the level of secretary\nof the Department of Personnel, Administrative Reforms and Rajbhasa,\nwithout assent of the Governor of Jharkhand. Memo is an executive\ninstruction is not issued under Article 161/163/309 of the Constitution of\nIndia.\n\n23. In Water Resource Department, there are 10 posts of Executive Engineer\n(Technical) that are unreserved, and 5 posts are in the reserved roster point.\nIn the present 3 posts of executive engineer are vacant in the unreserved\nroster point. If the earlier system for promotion from reserved to reserve\nand unreserved to unreserve is followed, the petitioners will be entitled for\nthe vacant posts.\n\nWP(S) No.672 of 2023\n\n24. This writ petition has been preferred by the petitioner serving on the post of\nConstable and the next higher promotional rank is of Assistant Sub\nInspector of Police. Petitioner belongs to the general category and was\nappointed on 27.09.2005 and claims to fulfill the eligibility criteria for\npromotion to the post of Assistant Sub Inspector of Police. Impugned\nnotification is affecting his promotional avenues.\n\n25. Person of SC/ST category, who had been appointed much after the\nappointment of the petitioner, by taking advantage of the accelerated\npromotion on reservation, got promoted to the post of ASI. Those juniors to\nthe petitioner have already become much senior to the petitioner and they\nare also enjoying consequential said seniority on the basis of 85th\nConstitutional amendment 2001.\n\n26. In the police department in Jharkhand already 26% of promotional posts\nearmarked for the employees belonging to the ST category, and 10% for the\nSC category, remaining 64% is meant for unreserved category.\n\n27. After completing the PTC training the petitioner became entitled for\npromotion to the next higher post of ASI, but vide Memo No., 6752 dated\n24.12.2020, blanket decision was taken by the state government for not\ngranting any promotion to the employees till further decision. The blanket\nstay was challenged in WP(S) No.1390/2021 and other analogous cases. In\npursuant to the order passed to consider the cases of employees for\npromotion, who were otherwise fit for promotion, the state government\ncame out with the impugned memo, by which the blanket stay on promotion\nhas been withdrawn with certain explanation and illustration regarding\npromotion of SC/ST government employees.\n\n28. It is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner(s) that in compliance to\nthe ratio laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R. K.\nSabharwal (supra), the Government of Bihar, Personnel and Administrative\nReforms Department issued letter dated 30.09.1995 which specifically\nprovides in Clause-4, that vacancy of category which becomes available\nafter retirement/promotion and for other reasons will be filled from the\nsame category from which the vacancy is available i.e. vacancy of general\nCategory will be filled from the General Category and vacancy of reserved\ncategory will be filled from the respective reserved category. On account of\nthe impugned letter, contradictory policy in promotion is being followed in\nthe State of Jharkhand and in the State of Bihar. In the State of Bihar in\npromotion matters, only the candidates from unreserved category take the\nroster points fixed for unreserved post, but in Jharkhand it has been thrown\nopen to all, so that even a candidate from the reserved category on seniority\ncan fill up the vacancies accruing against the unreserved point.\n\n29. Petitioners apprehend their promotional prospects to be jeopardized on\naccount of the impugned memo which seeks to give promotion to those\nappointed on reservation, to unreserved roster points.\n\nW.P(S) No.759 of 2023\n\n30. Petitioner(s) are serving on the post of Literate Constables who have been\nappointed on different dates on the post of Constable(s) in the year 2005.\nPetitioners' future prospect of promotion is being affected by the Letter of\nthe Government bearing Memo No.3463 of 2022.\n\n31. Petitioners were found fit for promotion by Central Selection Board/\nCommittee meeting held on 30.09.2020, and the said letter was issued from\nthe office of the Additional Director General (Personnel), Jharkhand and the\nsame was intimated to the Jharkhand Police, Hazaribagh and all the regional\nDIGs. Petitioner also completed the PTC training for promotion to the next\nhigher post of ASI in the year 2015 itself. However, vide Memo No.6752\ndated 24.12.2020, the State Government brought an order about promotion\nof the employees of the State Government. Consequently, the promotion of\nthe petitioner was stalled.\n\n32. Matter was considered in W.P.(S) No.1390 of 2021 wherein the said order\nwas quashed. However, superseding the petitioners, constables junior to the\npetitioner were granted promotion vide Memo No.116 dated 02.02.2023\nissued by the Additional Director General (Personnel), Jharkhand vide\nAnnexure-4.\n\n33. Provision of Jharkhand Police Manual has not been complied with, which\nmandates that before giving effect to recommendation for promotion at least\n40 days before passing of the order of promotion, the DIG shall publish by\nrange order, the name(s) of those published to be promoted.\nARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\n34. Mr. Rajendra Krishna, learned counsel for the respondents/intervener in\nW.P. (S) No. 696 of 2023, submits that the promotion to the Post of Dy. S.P.\nis governed by 'Jharkhand Rajya Police Seva Niyamabali, 2012 whereby\nChapter IV, Rule 11 deals with the promotion of Dy. S.P. from the feeder\npost of Inspector. Based on seniority-cum-merit, as per the said rule, feeder\npost comprises of the officers who are promoted to the rank of Inspector of\nPolice, Sargent Major as well as reserved Inspector. While granting\npromotion, the seniority in the feeder post is to be reckoned with as per the\nRule. Writ Petition is not maintainable as neither the rule is under-challenge\nnor the Gradation list of seniority is under-challenge.\n\n35. It is submitted by learned senior counsel Ajit Kumar for the answering\nrespondents in W.P. (S) No 3012 of 2023, that they were directly appointed\nto the feeder post of Assistant Engineer in the year 2013 whereas the\npetitioner was promoted to the post of Assistant Engineer in the year 2018\nand, therefore, they were seniors to the petitioner. At the time when they\nwere appointed to the post of Assistant Engineer, which is the feeder cadre\nfor promotion to the post of Executive Engineer, the petitioner was not even\nborn in the cadre of Assistant Engineer.\n\n36. The seniority list has not been challenged anywhere in the instant writ\npetition and as per the rules, the promotion is to be given on seniority-cum-\nmerit. Therefore, to accept the argument of the petitioner will amount to\npromotion by supersession of the seniority list. Since the answering\nrespondents already stand much senior to the petitioner, therefore, in the\nmatter of promotion the principle of reservation will have no application,\nrather they will be promoted on the basis of seniority cum merit.\n\n37. It is argued that the ratio laid down in\nDeepa EV\ncase (supra) will not apply\nin the present cases as the facts are distinguishable. The said authority was\nwith regard to a candidate who had sought age relaxation at the time of\nappointment on being the member of OBC, and having faced interview and\nthereafter they sought appointment against the unreserved seat. In the\ninstant case, it is not a case of appointment, rather it is a case of promotion\nwhere determining the factor of the seniority list and the said ratio will not\napply here.\n\n38. It is further submitted that the catch-up rule will not apply in the present\ncase, as the question is not about the inter-se seniority between the persons\ncoming from the same cadre. The petitioner is coming from the stream of\nJunior Engineer, whereas the answering respondents are directly appointed\nto the post of Assistant Engineer.\n\n39. Lastly, it is submitted that the petitioner was promoted to the post of\nAssistant Engineer on 20.11.2018 and the basic requirement for completing\nfive years on the feeder post would be complete only after rendering five\nyears of service on the said post in December, 2023. Before even being\neligible for the said post of promotion, they have preferred the writ petitions\nin the year 2022.\n\n40. The main contention of the petitioner is that the promotion to the post of\nofficers in the Engineering Service is guided by the Bihar Engineering\nService Class-1 Rules, 1939. Under rule 17 the promotion is to be made by\nseniority and merit, combined with more importance to be attached to merit.\nRule 27 provides that the seniority in the service shall be determined by the\ndate of officer's substantive appointment to the service irrespective of the\npay drawn by him, provided that the member of the service who holds a\nsuperior post substantively, shall always be deemed to be the senior to an\nofficer who holds an inferior post substantively. The seniority of the\nofficers appointed on the same date, shall be determined in accordance with\nthe order on merit in which they were placed at the time of their selection\nfor appointment.\n\n41. In the event of amalgamation of cadres, seniority is determined with\nreference to the date of appointment in particulars grade of substantive and\ncontinuous officiating post, whichever is earlier, but the inter-se seniority of\nincumbents, in any group of post as amongst themselves is not to be\ndisturbed in the process of amalgamation. Reference is made to the\nGovernment of Bihar, Department of Personnel Notification No. 3/R-I-106\n/72-P/15784 dated 26th August, 1972 which lays down general principle and\nprocedure for fixation of inter-se seniority in service cadre. This notification\nfurther provides that persons promoted from the gazetted rank to another\ngazetted rank shall rank senior to the persons promoted to the gazetted rank\nat the same time from non-gazetted rank. Reliance is placed on 2012 SCC\nOnline Delhi 2809 = 2012 (132) DRJ 229 DB (\nA.K. Gautam Vs. Union of\nIndia & Ors.\n), para 5.\n\n42. Mr. Shubhashis Rasik Soren, learned counsel for respondent no. 8 in\nW.P.(S) No. 3012 of 2022, adopts the plea already taken by Mr. Ajit Kumar,\nlearned senior counsel appearing on behalf of respondent nos. 6 and 7. It is\nfurther added that the case of respondent no.8 is on similar footing to that of\nrespondent nos. 6 and 7 as they had been directly appointed to the post of\nAssistant Engineer vide notification dated 02.09.2013 and as per the merit\nlist, he was placed at Sl. No. 11.\n\n43. With regard to the point of law raised on behalf of the Petitioner that the\nimpugned notification is not in the name of the Governor but is an\nexecutive order signed by the Principal Secretary, it is argued that\nArticle\n166(3)\nenables that the Governor shall make rules for the more convenient\ntransaction of the business of the Government of the State, and for the\nallocation among Ministers of the said business. In so far as it is not\nbusiness with respect to which the Governor is by or under this Constitution\nrequired to act in his discretion, therefore there is no illegality in the\nclarificatory letter of the Govt.\n\n44. Rule 55 of the Jharkhand Rules of Executive Business, 2000 has been\nframed under\nArticle 166(3)\nand Rule 55 specifically provides that before\nframing any policy or enacting any rule with regard to appointment,\nrecruitment promotion, the Department of Personnel, Administrative\nReforms and Rajbhasha shall be consulted. Department of Personnel,\nAdministrative Reforms and Rajbhasha derives clarificatory power in view\nof Rule 55 read with Schedule-1 (kha)(ii).\n\nARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE\n\n45. It is submitted by learned Advocate General appearing on behalf of the\nState that the instant clarificatory notification, which is under challenge, has\nbeen brought to remove anomaly that was taking place on wrong\ninterpretation of the judgment passed in\nR.K. Sabharwal\n(supra) case.\n\nThe\neffect of the interpretation to\nR.K. Sabharwal\n(supra) as proposed by the\nPetitioners, will lead to a situation where an officer, who is much below in\nthe seniority list, will be given promotion superseding the officer of the\nSchedule Castes and Schedule Tribes candidates only for the reason that the\nroster points to the promotional post were for unreserved post.\n\n46. It is further clarified that the promotion to the unreserved post is not\nperpetual in nature and the principle of replacement is followed to the\nextent that when a candidate of the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes is\npromoted to unreserved post, on a subsequent stage of roster clearance, the\nseat, occupied by the said candidate, is reckoned as reserved post and\nvacancy arising later is treated as unreserved post. Reliance is placed on\n(2022) 10 SCC 595 para 11.\nANALYSIS\n\n47. Litigating parties in these batch of cases, are locked in a dispute spurred by\na memo of the Government, which has direct repercussion on their\npromotional prospects in service. Impugned Memo in effect, throws open\nunreserved roster points in the promotional ladder, to those employees who\nhave been been appointed on reservation. There is no dispute whatsoever\nabout the employees of the SC/ST category who are selected on merit and\nappointed against the unreserved posts. Issue mainly is whether those\nemployees who were appointed on reserved posts can be promoted to the\nroster points for unreserved category. The following issues have been raised\nat Bar in the instant writ petition:\n\nI. Can employees of the SC/ST category appointed against reserved post,\nwho are senior to the employees of the unreserved category in the\nBasic cadre, be promoted to the unreserved roster point?\nII. If the impugned memo will result in excessive reservation?\nIII. Can the employees who are appointed on reservation, and have been\npromoted to reserved roster point, be promoted to the next higher post\nin the general roster on the basis of their seniority in the feeder post?\nIV. If the impugned memo dated 03.06.2022 is in consonance with\nthe principle as\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in\nR.K. Sabharwal and\nOrs. Vs State of Punjab & Ors\n1995(2) SCC 745 and the letters of the\nGovt. of India, in the memo referred to.\n\nV. Can the post of Inspector be treated as Basic cadre for promotion to the\npost of Dy.S.P?\n\nVI. If the employees appointed by reservation, can be given\npromotion to the unreserved roster point by way of an executive\ninstruction?\n\n48. 'Basic cadre' is the cadre where an employee is initially appointed,\nwhereas 'feeder post' is meant the cadre post from where the employee is\nsubsequently promoted, and is the cadre for considering the seniority to the\nnext higher post.\n\n49. There are certain consecrated principles of service jurisprudence which\nneeds to be set out at the outset, with abundant clarity. While applying the\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit, for the purpose of promotion, what is\nrequired to be considered is the inter-se seniority of the employees who are\neligible for consideration. Such seniority normally is determined on the\nbasis of length of service, but as between employees appointed on the\nsame date and having the same length of service, it is generally determined\non the basis of placement in the select list for appointment. Such\ndetermination of seniority confers certain rights and the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit gives effect to such rights flowing from seniority. It\ncannot, therefore, be said that in the matter of promotion, seniority has no\nrole for the employees eligible for promotion who are appointed on the\nsame date and have the same length of service. (\nRefer to B.V. Sivaiah v. K.\nAddanki Babu\n, (1998) 6 SCC 720).\n\n50. Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of\nIndra Sawhney Vs Union of India\nand Ors\n(1992) Supp (3) SCC 217, inter-alia held that reservation in\npromotion was ultra vires, as there was no provision in the Constitution to\nprovide for reservation in promotions. This brought into cloud reservation\nin promotion, hitherto being granted to the employees of Scheduled castes\nand Scheduled tribes.\n\nThe 77th amendment was brought to deal with this\nsituation, brought by the restriction on reservation in promotion, as ruled in\n\nIndra Sawhney\ncase (supra). This amendment incorporated clause (4A) in\n\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution, reads as under.\n\nArticle 16 (4-A)\nNothing in this article shall prevent the State from\nmaking any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with\nconsequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the\nservices under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the\nScheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State, are not\nadequately represented in the services under the State.\nThe above amendment has received the Apex Court's imprimatur in\nM.\nNagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212. It has been held,\n\n121. The impugned constitutional amendments by which\nArticles\n16(4-A)\nand\n16(4-B)\nhave been inserted flow from\nArticle 16(4).\n\nThey do not alter the structure of\nArticle 16(4).\nThey retain the\ncontrolling factors or the compelling reasons, namely, backwardness\nand inadequacy of representation which enables the States to\nprovide for reservation keeping in mind the overall efficiency of the\nState administration under\nArticle 335.\nThese impugned amendments\nare confined only to SCs and STs. They do not obliterate any of the\nconstitutional requirements, namely, ceiling limit of 50%\n(quantitative limitation), the concept of creamy layer (qualitative\nexclusion), the sub-classification between OBCs on one hand and\nSCs and STs on the other hand as held in Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp\n(3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] , the\nconcept of post-based roster with inbuilt concept of replacement as\nheld in R.K. Sabharwal [(1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 :\n\n(1995) 29 ATC 481]\nWith regard to the \"catch-up rule\" it observed 79. Reading the\nabove judgments, we are of the view that the concept of \"catch-up\"\n\nrule and \"consequential seniority\" are judicially evolved concepts to\ncontrol the extent of reservation. The source of these concepts is in\nservice jurisprudence. These concepts cannot be elevated to the\nstatus of an axiom like secularism, constitutional sovereignty, etc. It\ncannot be said that by insertion of the concept of \"consequential\nseniority\" the structure of\nArticle 16(1)\nstands destroyed or\nabrogated. It cannot be said that \"equality code\" under\nArticles 14\n,\nand\nis violated by deletion of the \"catch-up\" rule. These\nconcepts are based on practices. However, such practices cannot be\nelevated to the status of a constitutional principle so as to be beyond\nthe amending power of Parliament. Principles of service\njurisprudence are different from constitutional limitations.\nTherefore, in our view neither the \"catch-up\" rule nor the concept of\n\"consequential seniority\" is implicit in clauses (1) and (4) of\nArticle\nas correctly held in Virpal Singh Chauhan [(1995) 6 SCC 684 :\n1996 SCC (L&S) 1 : (1995) 31 ATC 813] .\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court also reiterated law on 50% ceiling in\nreservation and that\n\n48. It is the equality \"in fact\" which has to be decided looking at the\nground reality. Balancing comes in where the question concerns the\nextent of reservation. If the extent of reservation goes beyond cut-off\npoint then it results in reverse discrimination. Anti-discrimination\nlegislation has a tendency of pushing towards de facto reservation.\nTherefore, a numerical benchmark is the surest immunity against\ncharges of discrimination.\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n51. What follows from the above is that reservation in promotion as has been\nbrought by the Constitutional amendment has been tested and accepted by\njudicial verdict, with a rider that it cannot be excessive, beyond the 50%\nlimit as\nlaid down in\n\nIndra Sawhney\ncase.\n\n52. In W.P.(S) No. 3012 of 2022, Petitioner was Junior Engineer (Technical)\nappointed on 21.11.2007, and was promoted to the post of Assistant\nEngineer on 20.11.2018. The private Respondents in this case were\nappointed directly to the post of Assistant Engineer, in the year 2013.\nClaim of Respondents to promotion to the unreserved post of Executive\nEngineer, is not based on consequential seniority, but on account of their\nearlier appointment to the said feeder post. Petitioner seeks promotion on\nthe ground that as per roster the vacancy was against the unreserved post. If\nthe plea as advanced on behalf of the Petitioner is accepted, it will result to\nanomalous result. Vacancy arising in the unreserved roster point will have\nto be kept in abeyance, till those from General category become eligible for\npromotion. It will also result in employees of the SC/ST reserved category,\nbeing denied promotion despite being senior to those of the unreserved\ncategory at the time of their appointment. This will violate the principle of\nSeniority-cum-merit which is the standard for consideration of promotion\nas per the rules. In the result promotion of the answering Respondents 5 to\n9 has to be given primacy over the Petitioner, as they were directly\nappointed to the feeder post, before the promotion of the petitioner to the\nsaid post.\n\n53. The case of the Respondents in this case is further supported by the\nclarificatory letter of the Union of India dated 11.07.2002, on which the\nimpugned letter is based, which provides that if an unreserved vacancy\narises in a cadre and there is any SC/ST candidate within the normal\nzone of consideration in the feeder grade, such SC/ST candidate cannot\nbe denied promotion on the plea that the post is not reserved. Such a\ncandidate will be considered for promotion along with other candidates\ntreating him as if he belongs to general category. In case he is selected, he\nwill be appointed to the post and will be adjusted against the\nunreserved point.\n\n54. Catch up rule will also not apply in this case, as the Petitioner and the\nprivate Respondents have not been appointed to the feeder post by the same\nrecruitment process, or that Respondents had obtained accelerated\npromotion to the feeder post.\n\n55. A prior appointee to the feeder post by direct recruitment whether, reserved\nor unreserved is entitled to promotion to the unreserved post, vis-à-vis a\nsubsequent appointee, by virtue of his seniority and length of service in the\nfeeder post, subject to fulfilling the eligibility criteria as per the applicable\nservice rules.\n\n56. Validity of the impugned letter dated 03.06.2022 is not central to decide\nW.P(S) 3012 of 2022, because promotions are based on seniority-cum-\nmerit in the feeder post in which the private Respondents were appointed\nand are admittedly senior to the Petitioner from the date of their\nappointment.\n\n57. Under the circumstance W.P.(S) No.3012 of 2022 fails for the reason that\nthe private Respondents have been appointed to the post of Assistant\nEngineer, much before the promotion of the Petitioners to this post. The\nprinciple of law as\nlaid down in\n\nDeepa E.V. v. Union of India\n, (2017) 12\nSCC 680 will not apply in the present case, as it is not a case of\nappointment, but of promotion.\n\nIn\nDeepa E.V\ncase (supra) the appellant had\napplied under OBC category by availing age relaxation and also attended\ninterview under the \"OBC category\" therefore was held that she cannot\nclaim right to be appointed under the General category, in view of the\nexpress bar for the candidates belonging to SC/ST/OBC in the relevant\nrule.\n\n58. Validity of the impugned letter is central to the adjudication of the rest of\nWrit Petitions. It shall be desirable to extract the salient feature of the\nimpugned letter which are as under.\n\ni. By this letter, earlier Letter No. 6752 dated 24.12.2020 has been\nrecalled, in view of the recommendation of the Special Committee\nconstituted to consider the complaints of the members of Schedule\nCastes and Schedule Tribes in the matter of promotion. Anomaly\nwhich this letter seeks to correct is that, those juniors in unreserved\ncategory were being given precedence in promotion, to those who\nwere senior and members of Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes\ncategory.\n\nii. The stay of promotion was recalled under this letter with following\nclarification:\n\n\"From the judgment delivered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nR.K. Sabharwal and Others Vs. State of Punjab & Ors.\non\n10.02.1995 and in the light of the letters of the Department of\nPersonnel, Public Grievance and Pension, Government of India,\nLetter No. 36028/17/2001 Estt. (RES) dated 11.07.2002 and Letter\nNo. 36012/45/2005 Estt (RES) dated 10.08.2010, it is clear that\nwhile considering promotion on seniority-cum-merit in the Basic\ncadre, those who are members of Schedule Castes and Schedule\nTribes category and are senior, will be considered for promotion to\nunreserved post over those who are in general category. While\ngranting promotion against the unreserved post, it will not be\nnecessary to see as to whether the members of Schedule Castes and\nSchedule Tribes were appointed on the basis of merit or on\nreservation\".\n\n59. This letter draws on the letters of the Department of Personnel, Public\nGrievance and Pension, Government of India, Letter No. 36028/17/2001\nEstt. (RES) dated 11.07.2002 which is extracted below:-\n\nSubject : Reservation in promotion-Treatment of SC/ST candidates\npromoted on their own merit.\n\nThe clarification has been made which as under:-\n\n(i) The SC/ST candidates appointed by promotion on their own\nmerit and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\nqualifications will not be adjusted against the reserved points of the\nreservation roster. They will be adjusted against unreserved points.\n\n(ii) If an unreserved vacancy arises in a cadre and there is any SC/ST\ncandidate within the normal zone of consideration in the feeder\ngrade, such SC/ST candidate cannot be denied promotion on\nthe plea that the post is not reserved. Such a candidate will be\nconsidered for promotion along with other candidates treating him\nas if he belongs to general category. In case he is selected, he will\nbe appointed to the post and will be adjusted against the\nunreserved point.\n\n(iii) SC/ST candidates appointed on their own merit (by direct\nrecruitment or promotion) and adjusted against unreserved points\nwill retain their status of SC/ST and will be eligible to get benefit\nof reservation in future/further promotions, if any.\n\nSubsequent office memorandum dated 10th August, 2010 of the Ministry of\nDepartment of Personnel, Public Grievance and Pension, Government of\nIndia is also to the same effect.\n\nIt will also be desirable to extract the relevant ratio as\nlaid down in\n\nR.K.\nSabharwal v. State of Punjab\n, (1995) 2 SCC 745, as the impugned letter\nbanks on the ratio as\nlaid down in\nthis case.\n\n5. The roster is implemented in the form of running account from year\nto year. The purpose of \"running account\" is to make sure that the\nScheduled Castes/Schedule Tribes and Backward Classes get their\npercentage of reserved posts. .......... Once the prescribed percentage\nof posts is filled the numerical test of adequacy is satisfied and\nthereafter the roster does not survive.\n\n7. When all the roster points in a cadre are filled the required\npercentage of reservation is achieved. Once the total cadre has full\nrepresentation of the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Backward Classes\nin accordance with the reservation policy then the vacancies arising\nthereafter in the cadre are to be filled from amongst the category of\npersons to whom the respective vacancies belong.\n\n60. To appreciate issues raised it will be desirable to consider some of the fall\nout of the impugned letter dated 03.06.2022.\n\nI. Constables of S.C/S.T category appointed much after the Petitioner, by\ntaking advantage of accelerated promotion on reservation got\npromoted to the post of ASI, against the reserved point roster. It is\napprehended that in view of the impugned letter, if they are granted\npromotion to the next promotional ladder of sub-inspector to the\nunreserved roster point, on the basis of their seniority in the feeder post\nfor the next promotion, and the unreserved posts in the rank of sub\ninspector is filled up, it will adversely affect the promotional prospects\nof those from the General category. (As raised in W.P. (S) 672 of 2023\n& W.P. (S) 759 of 2023)\nII. Petitioners in W.P. (S) 3012 of 2022 & W.P. (S) 5217 of 2022,\napprehend similar consequence as a result of throwing open of the\nunreserved roster points in the promotional posts, to those promoted\nfrom reserved point roster.\n\n61. Promotion to reserved roster point is covered under\nArticle 16 (4-A)\nof the\nConstitution. After filling up reserved roster point, if the unreserved roster\npoints are also filled up by those who were initially appointed, or promoted\non reservation, then it will definitely impinge on the promotional avenue of\nthose in the unreserved category. The vacancies ensuing against the\nreserved posts, can be filled up from unreserved category on a later date by\nthe \"principle of replacement\". But before such vacancy occurs in reserved\ncategory there will be an excess of employees from the reserved category,\nwho will be stonewalling the promotional prospects of employees from\nGeneral category, and in the meantime some may retire from the service,\nand permanently lose their legitimate right to promotion, despite having\nfulfilled the requisite eligibility criteria. This will lead to excessive\nreservation, as those who are appointed on reservation in the SC/ST\ncategory are promoted not only against the reserved roster points, but also\nagainst the unreserved roster points leading to an excess of representation.\nAs stated above principle of replacement cannot fully mitigate the skewed\noutcome of such promotions. Such excessive reservation will be against the\nratio as\nlaid down in\n\nM. Nagraj Vs. Union of India\n(2006) 8 SCC 21 and\nIndra Sawhney [(1992) Supp (3) SCC 217].\n\n62. Equality is the foundational ideal of the Constitution and despite being\naccepted as a dynamic concept with many facets, it cannot be interpreted in\na manner that it loses its fundamental essence. Constitution is poised on a\ndelicate balance of competing rights. If that balance is disturbed, the\npreambular objectives of Justice, liberty, equality and fraternity will be\nundermined. Here we are dealing with cases of employees who have started\ntheir career at the lowest rung of administration like constables and literate\nconstables, apart from those who are in the rank of Junior Engineer,\nAssistant Engineer, Technical Officers. Any cadre to remain vibrant need to\nhave upward mobility with modest promotional avenues. Human life is all\nabout hope and aspirations for self-improvement. Employees irrespective\nof their category have legitimate expectations of promotion in their service\ncareer. If employees with unblemished service record, are denied\npromotion without any justifiable reason, only for their accidents of birth,\nthen institutions can become morbid, breeding dispiritedness, disaffection\namong the employees.\n\n63. It is also established that seniority between employees appointed on the\nbasis of placement in the select list for appointment, is the fundamental\nfactor for determining seniority. Roster is a mechanism to maintain\npercentage of quota reserved for respective categories in the cadre. In order\nto fill up the reserved roster point, and maintain the percentage of\nreservation, promotion from the reserved category, dehors the select list\nseniority, is the legally accepted norm. To fill up the reserved point roster,\neven consequential seniority to those earlier granted promotion has been\nallowed under\nArticle 16 (4-A).\nIt has however been emphatically held in\n\nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab\n, (1995) 2 SCC 745 :\n\n\"7. When all the roster points in a cadre are filled the required\npercentage of reservation is achieved. Once the total cadre has full\nrepresentation of the Scheduled Castes/Tribes and Backward\nClasses in accordance with the reservation policy then the\nvacancies arising thereafter in the cadre are to be filled from\namongst the category of persons to whom the respective vacancies\nbelong.\nIn\nM. Nagaraj v. Union of India\n, (2006) 8 SCC 212,\noverriding concern to maintain the 50% quota is reflected in the\nfollowing observation 82. Before dealing with the scope of the\nconstitutional amendments we need to recap the judgments\nin Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S)\nSupp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] and R.K. Sabharwal [(1995) 2 SCC\n745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481] . In the former\ncase the majority held that 50% rule should be applied to each\nyear otherwise it may happen that the open competition channel\nmay get choked if the entire cadre strength is taken as a unit.\nHowever, in R.K. Sabharwal [(1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC\n(L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481] this Court stated that the entire\ncadre strength should be taken into account to determine whether\nthe reservation up to the quota limit has been reached. It was\nclarified that the judgment in Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC\n217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] was confined\nto initial appointments and not to promotions. The operation of the\nroster for filling the cadre strength, by itself, ensures that the\nreservation remains within the ceiling limit of 50%\".\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n64. Above authorities underline some of the fundamental principles while\nallowing reservation in promotion. They may be summed up as under:\n\nFirstly, when all the roster points in a cadre are filled, the required\npercentage of reservation is achieved, then the vacancies arising thereafter\nin the cadre are to be filled from amongst the category of persons to whom\nthe respective vacancies belong.\n\nSecondly, numerical benchmarks like ceiling limit of 50% based on post-\nspecific roster is to be maintained.\n\n65. The office memorandum of the Govt. of India\nreferred to above\nspecifically\nin its very 'subject' refers to reservation in promotion of SC/St candidates\nappointed on their own merit. Meaning thereby it is not with regard to\nthose appointed on reservation. Clause (i) and (iii) of its letter, specifically\nrefers to those who are appointed on their own merit. Clause (ii) protects\nthe interests of the SC/ST candidates within the normal zone of\nconsideration in the feeder grade, and are to be considered for promotion\nalong with other candidates treating him to be belonged to general category.\nThe import of this clause is that on seniority in the feeder cadre, candidate\nfrom the SC/ST category to be considered for promotion to the unreserved\npoint.\n\n66. A careful reading of the impugned letter dated 03.06.2022 will show that\nexpression, while considering promotion on seniority-cum-merit in the\nBasic cadre is used and not 'feeder post'. What the impugned letter thus\nprotects, is seniority derived by way of initial appointment.\n\n67. Unreserved roster point cannot be made open, to those promoted to\nreserved roster point, as it will lead to excessive reservation in the\npromotional post, and not permissible in view of the ratio discussed\nabove. The balancing act in the form of 'replacement' to maintain the\npercentage of quota, will take time to work out, only after some retire from\nthe reserved category. By the time such vacancy accrues in the reserved\nquota for replacement by those from the unreserved category, proportion\nwill be excessive. This will certainly eclipse the promotional prospect of\nthose appointed in unreserved category, who may even retire from service\nby the time replacement occurs. Therefore, such further promotion from the\nfeeder post to the unreserved roster point is not permissible, as it will\namount to reverse discrimination against those appointed in unreserved\ncategory, seriously undermining their right of promotion. Excessive\nreservation is not permissible unless it is supported by quantifiable data\n(\nRefer to M.Nagraj\ncase para-86,102).\n\nAny contrary of the impugned letter\nwill also not be in consonance with the ratio as\nlaid down in\n\nR.K Sabharwal\n\ncase (supra) as it permits promotion from reserved to reserved roster points.\n\n68. In view of the above, the issues raised at Bar is answered as under:\n\nI. Employees of the SC/ST category appointed against reserved post,\nwho are senior to employees of the unreserved category in the Basic\ncadre, can be promoted to the unreserved roster point. Such employees\ncan also be promoted to the reserved roster point. Against unreserved\nvacancy in general cadre any SC/ST candidate in the feeder post who\nis directly appointed (not promoted) to the said feeder post, and is\nsenior to any employee of the unreserved category, can be promoted to\nthe unreserved roster point.\n\nII. The impugned memo being confined to promotion from Basic cadre,\nwill not result in excessive reservation in the promotional posts.\nIII. Seniority-cum-merit in the Basic cadre of appointment can only be\nconsidered for promotion of SC/ST employees appointed on reserved\nposts and not in the next higher post.\n\nIV. The impugned memo dated 03.06.2022, is in consonance with the\nprinciple as\nlaid down by\nthe Apex Court in\nR.K. Sabharwal and Ors.\nVs State of Punjab & Ors\n1995(2) SCC 745 and the letters of the Govt.\nof India, in the memo referred to as it is confined to considering\npromotion on seniority-cum-merit in the Basic cadre.\nV. Post of Inspector is the feeder post for promotion to the post of Dy.S.P,\nand seniority-cum-merit is to be considered in this cadre for promotion\nto the post of Dy.S.P. It cannot be treated as Basic cadre, as it will\nresult in promotion of those appointed to the reserved roster point of\nInspector, to the unreserved roster point of Dy.S.P, by treating it as\nBasic cadre. Promotion to the Post of Dy.S.P. is governed by\n'Jharkhand Rajya Police Seva Niyamabali, 2012 whereby Chapter IV,\nRule 11 deals with the promotion of Dy.S.P. from the feeder post of\nInspector. Exercise to convert the feeder post to Basic cadre is not\nsupported by rule, and is a colourable exercise of power by an\nexecutive instruction, to favour those promoted on reserved roster\npoint of Inspector, to the detriment of those in the general category.\n\nPart of Letter No. 12/M. 2-1010/2022-4474 dated 10.11.2022 which\nconverts the post of Inspector as Basic cadre not being in consonance\nwith the law\nlaid down in\n\nR.K. Sabharwal\ncase (supra) is struck down.\n\nVI. There is no bar in giving promotion to the unreserved roster point by\nway of an executive instruction as per their seniority in the Basic\ncadre, in view of the ratio as\nlaid down in\n\nSudhakar Baburao Nangnure\nVs. Noreshwar Raghunathrao Shende\n(2020) 11 SCC 399.\nRESULT\nChallenge to the impugned Memo No. 3463 dated 03.06.2022 made in all\nthe Writ Petitions fails, subject to the purport of this memo as held above.\nApprehension of Petitioners in W.P.(S) No.2189 of 2023, W.P.(S) No.5217\nof 2022, W.P.(S) No.3216 of 2022, W.P.(S) No.672 of 2023 and W.P.(S)\nNo.759 of 2023, that this memo will result in excessive reservation is\nmisconceived and, accordingly, these Writ Petitions stand disposed of with\ndirection to initiate the process for promotion for those in the consideration\nzone without any further delay.\n\nW.P.(S) No.696 of 2023 is allowed to the extent that Part of Letter No.\n12/M. 2-1010/2022-4474 dated 10.11.2022 which converts the post of\nInspector to Basic cadre is struck down.\n\nW.P.(S) No.3012 of 2022 is dismissed as the Private Respondents were\nappointed to the feeder post of Assistant Engineer, much before the\npromotion of the Petitioner to this post.\n\nI.A., if any, stands disposed of.\n\n(Gautam Kumar Choudhary, J.)\nJharkhand High Court, Ranchi\nDated, the 12th March, 2024\nAFR/ AKT/Sandeep/Anit",
