These Writ Petitions broadly fall in following three categories:-\n\nA] Writ Petition (Civil) No. 936 of 2018 filed by four\n\npetitioners, prays for appropriate directions that after the\n\npromulgation of Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010 (“2010\n\nRules”, for short), all appointments ought to be in conformity with\n\n2010 Rules and allocation of seniority must be in accordance with\n\nthe Cyclic Order provided in Schedule VII to 2010 Rules. In terms\n\nof 2010 Rules, posts in the cadre of District Judges in the Higher\n\nJudicial Service in State of Rajasthan were required to be filled up in\n\naccordance with quota of 50% for Promotees, 25% for Direct\n\nRecruits and 25% by way of Limited Competitive Examination\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n(“LCE”, for short) in keeping with law\nlaid down by\nthis Court in\n\nAll India Judges Association vs. Union of India and Others\n1.\n\nThis Writ Petition filed by candidates who were successful in LCE\n\nprays that they be allocated seniority in terms of the Cyclic Order in\n\nSchedule VII. In this group fall Writ Petition (Civil) No.498 of 2018\n\nand Writ Petition Diary No.13252 of 2019 which pray that the inter\n\nse seniority between candidates who were successful in LCE must\n\nbe determined on the basis of their merit in LCE and not by their\n\nerstwhile seniority.\n\nB] Writ Petition (Civil) No. 967 of 2018 has been filed by 37\n\nDirect Recruits challenging the Provisional Seniority List dated\n\n16.08.2017 with regard to the cadre of District Judges in the Higher\n\nJudicial Service in the State, on the ground that the appointments\n\nmade after 2010 Rules had come into effect, ought to be in\n\naccordance with the Cyclic Order; and the inter se seniority and\n\nplacement of Direct Recruits and Promotees, promoted after 2010\n\nRules had come into effect must be in accordance with 2010 Rules.\n\nC] Writ Petition (Civil) No.1471 of 2018 has been filed by\n\nRajasthan Judicial Service Officers Association (“the Association”,\n1 (2002) 4 SCC 247\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nfor short) seeking benefit of ad-hoc/officiating service put in by\n\nPromotees who were promoted on ad-hoc basis as Fast Track Court\n\nJudges and also prays for re-determination of vacancies of Direct\n\nRecruits submitting that the vacancies earmarked for Direct Recruits\n\nwere in excess of their quota. Writ Petition (C) Nos.464 of 2019,\n\n895 of 2019, 897 of 2019, 899 of 2019 and 1008 of 2018 are filed by\n\nJudicial Officers seeking similar benefit in respect of ad-\n\nhoc/officiating service as Fast Track Court Judges in the State and\n\npray that such candidates be placed above the Direct Recruits in the\n\ncadre of District Judges in the State.\n\n2. Since the issues involved in all these matters pertain to\n\nappointments to and allocation of seniority in respect of, the cadre of\n\nDistrict Judges in the State of Rajasthan and regarding effect of 2010\n\nRules, the petitions were heard together. Before we deal with the factual\n\naspects, it would be necessary to consider certain decisions of this Court\n\ntouching upon the establishment of Fast Track Courts as well as the\n\nconcept of promotion through LCE and the respective quotas for\n\ncandidates coming from three different streams in the Higher Judicial\n\nService in various States.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n2.1.\nIn\nAll India Judges’ Association v. Union of India\nand others2,\n\nthe issues with regard to the working conditions of the members of the\n\nsubordinate judiciary throughout the country came up for consideration.\n\nNumber of directions were issued by this Court. However, review\n\npetitions were filed by Union of India seeking certain\n\nmodifications/clarifications. These review petitions were disposed of by\n\nthis Court while issuing further directions in\nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation and others v. Union of India\nand others3. In pursuance of\n\nsaid directions, First National Judicial Pay Commission under the\n\nChairmanship of Mr. Justice K.J. Shetty (former Judge of this Court) was\n\nconstituted on 21.03.1996. The terms of reference were thereafter\n\nmodified on 16.12.1997 and the Commission was also empowered to\n\nconsider and grant interim relief. By Report dated 31.01.1998 some\n\ninterim relief was granted by Justice Shetty Commission. After due\n\ndeliberations Justice Shetty Commission submitted a Report on\n\n11.11.1999 and all the States/ Union Territories were directed by this\n\nCourt4 to send their responses to Union of India so that all the issues could\n\nbe deliberated upon and dealt with.4\n\n2 (1992) 1 SCC 119\n3 (1993) 4 SCC 288\n4 (2002) 4 SCC 274\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n2.2 After considering all the submissions, this Court in its decision\n\ndated 21.03.2002 in\nAll India Judges’ Association and others v. Union of\n\nIndia\nand others1 passed some directions. We are presently concerned\n\nwith the observations made in paragraphs 24 to 29 in which reference was\n\nmade to the 85th Report of the Standing Committee of Parliament\n\nrecommending that there should be increase in the number of Judges.\n\nSaid Committee had noted the Judges to Population ratio and in tune with\n\n120th Report of the Law Commission, recommendations were made to\n\nincrease the Judges’ strength to 50 Judges per 10 lakh people in the first\n\ninstance. Recommendations made by Justice Shetty Commission were\n\nalso considered and recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service in the cadre\n\nof District Judges was also subject-matter of directions. Paragraphs 27 to\n\n29 are quoted for ready reference:\n\n“27. Another question which falls for consideration is\nthe method of recruitment to the posts in the cadre of\nHigher Judicial Service i.e. District Judges and\nAdditional District Judges. At the present moment,\nthere are two sources for recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service, namely, by promotion from amongst\nthe members of the Subordinate Judicial Service and\nby direct recruitment. The subordinate judiciary is the\nfoundation of the edifice of the judicial system. It is,\ntherefore, imperative, like any other foundation, that it\nshould become as strong as possible. The weight on\nthe judicial system essentially rests on the subordinate\njudiciary. While we have accepted the\nrecommendation of the Shetty Commission which\nwill result in the increase in the pay scales of the\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nsubordinate judiciary, it is at the same time necessary\nthat the judicial officers, hard-working as they are,\nbecome more efficient. It is imperative that they keep\nabreast of knowledge of law and the latest\npronouncements, and it is for this reason that the\nShetty Commission has recommended the\nestablishment of a Judicial Academy, which is very\nnecessary. At the same time, we are of the opinion\nthat there has to be certain minimum standard,\nobjectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the\nHigher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges\nand District Judges. While we agree with the Shetty\nCommission that the recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service i.e. the District Judge cadre from\namongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the\nprocess of recruitment is to be by a competitive\nexamination, both written and viva voce, we are of the\nopinion that there should be an objective method of\ntesting the suitability of the subordinate judicial\nofficers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service.\nFurthermore, there should also be an incentive\namongst the relatively junior and other officers to\nimprove and to compete with each other so as to excel\nand get quicker promotion. In this way, we expect that\nthe calibre of the members of the Higher Judicial\nService will further improve.\nIn order to achieve this,\nwhile the ratio of 75 per cent appointment by\npromotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to the\nHigher Judicial Service is maintained, we are,\nhowever, of the opinion that there should be two\nmethods as far as appointment by promotion is\nconcerned: 50 per cent of the total posts in the Higher\nJudicial Service must be filled by promotion on the\nbasis of principle of merit-cum-seniority. For this\npurpose, the High Courts should devise and evolve a\ntest in order to ascertain and examine the legal\nknowledge of those candidates and to assess their\ncontinued efficiency with adequate knowledge of\ncase-law. The remaining 25 per cent of the posts in\nthe service shall be filled by promotion strictly on the\nbasis of merit through the limited departmental\ncompetitive examination for which the qualifying\nservice as a Civil Judge (Senior Division) should be\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nnot less than five years. The High Courts will have to\nframe a rule in this regard.\n\n(emphasis\nsupplied)\n\n28. As a result of the aforesaid, to recapitulate, we\ndirect that recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service\ni.e. the cadre of District Judges will be:\n\n(1) (a) 50 per cent by promotion from amongst the\nCivil Judges (Senior Division) on the basis of\nprinciple of merit-cum-seniority and passing a\nsuitability test;\n\n(b) 25 per cent by promotion strictly on the basis\nof merit through limited competitive examination\nof Civil Judges (Senior Division) having not less\nthan five years’ qualifying service; and\n\n(c) 25 per cent of the posts shall be filled by\ndirect recruitment from amongst the eligible\nadvocates on the basis of the written and viva\nvoce test conducted by respective High Courts.\n(2) Appropriate rules shall be framed as above by the\nHigh Courts as early as possible.\n\n29. Experience has shown that there has been a\nconstant discontentment amongst the members of the\nHigher Judicial Service in regard to their seniority in\nservice. For over three decades a large number of\ncases have been instituted in order to decide the\nrelative seniority from the officers recruited from the\ntwo different sources, namely, promotees and direct\nrecruits. As a result of the decision today, there will,\nin a way, be three ways of recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service. The quota for promotion which we\nhave prescribed is 50 per cent by following the\nprinciple “merit-cum-seniority”, 25 per cent strictly\non merit by limited departmental competitive\nexamination and 25 per cent by direct recruitment.\nExperience has also shown that the least amount of\nlitigation in the country, where quota system in\nrecruitment exists, insofar as seniority is concerned, is\nwhere a roster system is followed. For example, there\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nis, as per the rules of the Central Government, a 40-\npoint roster which has been prescribed which deals\nwith the quotas for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\nTribes. Hardly, if ever, there has been a litigation\namongst the members of the service after their\nrecruitment as per the quotas, the seniority is fixed by\nthe roster points and irrespective of the fact as to\nwhen a person is recruited. When roster system is\nfollowed, there is no question of any dispute arising.\nThe 40-point roster has been considered and approved\nby this Court in\nR.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab5\n.\nOne of the methods of avoiding any litigation and\nbringing about certainty in this regard is by specifying\nquotas in relation to posts and not in relation to the\nvacancies. This is the basic principle on the basis of\nwhich the 40-point roster works.\n\nWe direct the High\nCourts to suitably amend and promulgate seniority\nrules on the basis of the roster principle as approved\nby this Court in\nR.K. Sabharwal\ncase as early as\npossible. We hope that as a result thereof there would\nbe no further dispute in the fixation of seniority. It is\nobvious that this system can only apply prospectively\nexcept where under the relevant rules seniority is to\nbe determined on the basis of quota and rotational\nsystem. The existing relative seniority of the members\nof the Higher Judicial Service has to be protected but\nthe roster has to be evolved for the future. Appropriate\nrules and methods will be adopted by the High Courts\nand approved by the States, wherever necessary by\n31-3-2003.”\n\n2.3.\n\nSoon thereafter, in its decision rendered on 06.05.2002 in\nBrij\n\nMohan Lal v. Union of India\nand others6 this Court had an occasion to\n\nconsider the issue relating to Fast Track Courts. The 11 th Finance\n\nCommission had allocated Rs.502.90 crores for the purpose of setting up\n\n5 (1995) 2 SCC 745\n6 (2002) 5 SCC 1\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n1734 courts in various States to deal with long pending cases, particularly\n\nsessions cases. On the basis of said recommendations a note was prepared\n\nby the Department of Justice, Government of India to set up Fast Track\n\nCourts. Challenges were raised in some High Courts to the constitution of\n\nsuch Fast Track Courts and the matters were dealt by this Court in\n\nTransfer Petitions. After considering rival submissions, directions were\n\nissued in para 10 and for the present purposes direction Nos.1 to 8, 14 and\n\n18 are relevant:-\n\n“10. Keeping in view the laudable objectives with\nwhich the Fast Track Courts Scheme has been\nconceived and introduced, we feel the following\ndirections, for the present, would be sufficient to take\ncare of initial teething problems highlighted by the\nparties:\n\nDirections by the Court\n\n1. The first preference for appointment of judges\nof the Fast Track Courts is to be given by ad-hoc\npromotions from amongst eligible judicial officers.\n\nWhile giving such promotion, the High Court shall\nfollow the procedures in force in the matter of\npromotion to such posts in Superior/Higher Judicial\nServices.\n\n2. The second preference in appointments to Fast\nTrack Courts shall be given to retired judges who\nhave good service records with no adverse comments\nin their ACRs, so far as judicial acumen, reputation\nregarding honesty, integrity and character are\nconcerned. Those who were not given the benefit of\ntwo years’ extension of the age of superannuation,\nshall not be considered for appointment. It should be\nensured that they satisfy the conditions\nlaid down in\n\nArticles 233(2)\nand\nof the Constitution. The High\nCourt concerned shall take a decision with regard to\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nthe minimum-maximum age of eligibility to ensure\nthat they are physically fit for the work in Fast Track\nCourts.\n\n3. No judicial officer who was dismissed or\nremoved or compulsorily retired or made to seek\nretirement shall be considered for appointment under\nthe Scheme. Judicial officers who have sought\nvoluntary retirement after initiation of departmental\nproceedings/inquiry shall not be considered for\nappointment.\n\n4. The third preference shall be given to members\nof the Bar for direct appointment in these courts. They\nshould be preferably in the age group of 35-45 years,\nso that they could aspire to continue against the\nregular posts if the Fast Track Courts cease to\nfunction. The question of their continuance in service\nshall be reviewed periodically by the High Court\nbased on their performance. They may be absorbed in\nregular vacancies, if subsequent recruitment takes\nplace and their performance in the Fast Track Courts\nis found satisfactory. For the initial selection, the High\nCourt shall adopt such methods of selection as are\nnormally followed for selection of members of the\nBar as direct recruits to the Superior/Higher Judicial\nServices.\n\n5. Overall preference for appointment in Fast\nTrack Courts shall be given to eligible officers who\nare on the verge of retirement subject to they being\nphysically fit.\n\n6. The recommendation for selection shall be\nmade by a committee of at least three Judges of the\nHigh Court, constituted by the Chief Justice of the\nHigh Court concerned in this regard. The final\ndecision in the matter shall be taken by the Full Court\nof the High Court.\n\n7. After ad-hoc promotion of judicial officers to\nthe Fast Track Courts, the consequential vacancies\nshall be filled up immediately by organizing a special\nrecruitment drive. Steps should be taken in advance to\ninitiate process for selection to fill up these vacancies\nmuch before the judicial officers are promoted to the\nFast Track Courts, so that vacancies may not be\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\ngenerated at the lower levels of the subordinate\njudiciary. The High Court and the State Government\nconcerned shall take prompt steps to fill up the\nconsequential as well as existing vacancies in the\nsubordinate courts on priority basis. The State\nGovernment concerned shall take necessary decisions\nwithin a month from the receipt of the\nrecommendations made by the High Court.\n\n8. Priority shall be given by the Fast Track Courts\nfor disposal of those sessions cases which are pending\nfor the longest period of time, and/or those involving\nundertrials. Similar shall be the approach for civil\ncases i.e. old cases shall be given priority.\n\n9. …...\n\n10…...\n\n11…..\n\n12 …..\n\n13 …..\n\n14. No right will be conferred on judicial officers\nin service for claiming any regular promotion on the\nbasis of his/her appointment on ad-hoc basis under the\nScheme. The service rendered in Fast Track Courts\nwill be deemed as service rendered in the parent\ncadre. In case any judicial officer is promoted to\nhigher grade in the parent cadre during his tenure in\nFast Track Courts, the service rendered in Fast Track\nCourts will be deemed to be service in such higher\ngrade.\n\n15…..\n\n16….\n\n17….\n\n18. The High Court and the State Government\nshall ensure that there exists no vacancy so far as the\nFast Track Courts are concerned, and necessary steps\nin that regard shall be taken within three months from\ntoday. In other words, steps should be taken to set up\nall the Fast Track Courts within the stipulated time.”\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n2.4. Thereafter in\nMalik Mazhar Sultan and another v. U.P. Public\n\nService Commission\nand others7 the issues regarding timely declaration\n\nof vacancies in judicial service and timely appointments were considered\n\nby this Court as under:\n\n“23. It is absolutely necessary to evolve a mechanism\nto speedily determine and fill vacancies of judges at\nall levels. For this purpose, timely steps are required\nto be taken for determination of vacancies, issue of\nadvertisement, conducting examinations, interviews,\ndeclaration of the final results and issue of orders of\nappointments. For all these and other steps, if any, it is\nnecessary to provide for fixed time schedule so that\nthe system works automatically and there is no delay\nin filling up of vacancies. The dates for taking these\nsteps can be provided for on the pattern similar to\nfilling of vacancies in some other services or filling of\nseats for admission in medical colleges. The schedule\nappended to the regulations governing medical\nadmissions sets out a time schedule for every step to\nbe strictly adhered to every year. The exception can be\nprovided for where sufficient number of vacancies do\nnot occur in a given year.\nThe adherence to strict time\nschedule can ensure timely filling of vacancies. All\nthe State Governments, the Union Territories and/or\nthe High Courts are directed to provide for time\nschedule for the aforesaid purposes so that every year\nvacancies that may occur are timely filled. All the\nState Governments, the Union Territories and the\nHigh Courts are directed to file within three months\ndetails of the time schedule so fixed and date from\nwhich the time schedule so fixed would be\noperational.”\n\n2.5. After the disposal of the appeals in\nMalik Mazhar Sultan and\n\nothers v. U.P. Public Service Commission7\nsuggestions were made by\n7 (2006) 9 SCC 507\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nsome of the State Governments and written submissions were also filed\n\nby the learned Amicus Curiae. In its order dated 04.01.2017 8, this Court\n\nissued further directions and prescribed timelines. From paragraph 7\n\nonwards directions were issued for filling up vacancies in various cadres\n\nincluding the cadre of District Judges.\n\n2.6. By order dated 20.04.2010 passed in\nAll India Judges’\n\nAssociation v. Union of India\nand others9 directions issued earlier with\n\nregard to 25% quota for Limited Departmental Competitive Examination\n\nwere modified by this court as under:\n\n“6. Having regard to various strategies available, we\nare of the considered view that suitable amendment is\nto be made for this 25% quota of limited departmental\ncompetitive examination. We are also of the view,\nwith the past experience, that it is desirable that 25%\nquota be reduced to 10%. We feel so as the required\nresult, which was sought to be achieved by this\nprocess could not be achieved, thus it calls for\nmodification.\n\n7. Thus, we direct that henceforth only 10% of the\ncadre strength of District Judges be filled up by\nlimited departmental competitive examination with\nthose candidates who have qualified service of five\nyears as Civil Judge (Senior Division). Every year\nvacancies are to be ascertained and the process of\nselection shall be taken care of by the High Courts. If\nany of the post is not filled up under 10% quota, the\nsame shall be filled up by regular promotion. In some\nof the High Courts, process of selection of these 25%\n\n8 (2008) 17 SCC 703.\n\n9 (2010) 15 SCC 170\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nquota by holding limited departmental competitive\nexamination is in progress, such process can be\ncontinued and the unfilled seats, if meritorious\ncandidates are available, should be filled up. But if for\nsome reason the seats are not filled up, they may be\nfilled up by regular promotion and apply the usual\nmode of promotion process. Thus we pass the\nfollowing order.\n\n8. Hereinafter, there shall be 25% of seats for direct\nrecruitment from the Bar, 65% of seats are to be filled\nup by regular promotion of Civil Judge (Senior\nDivision) and 10% seats are to be filled up by limited\ndepartmental competitive examination. If candidates\nare not available for 10% seats, or are not able to\nqualify in the examination then vacant posts are to be\nfilled up by regular promotion in accordance with the\nService Rules applicable.\n\n9. All the High Courts are hereby directed to take\nsteps to see that existing Service Rules be amended\npositively with effect from 1-1-2011. If the Rules are\nnot suitably amended, this order shall prevail and\nfurther recruitment from 1-1-2011 shall be continued\naccordingly as directed by us. The time schedule\nprescribed in the order dated 4-1-2007 (in Malik\nMazhar Sultan case8) shall be strictly adhered to for\nthe purpose of selection. All the vacancies are to be\nfilled up in that particular year and there shall not be\nany carry forward of the unfilled posts.”\n\n3. In the State of Rajasthan, the matters relating to Constitution of\n\nCourts and Jurisdiction of Courts were dealt with by the Rajasthan Civil\n\nCourts Ordinance, 1950 which consolidated and amended the law relating\n\nto Civil Courts in the State. Clause 6 of said Ordinance dealt with Classes\n\nof Courts; Clause 8 dealt with Power to fix number of District Judges\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nwhile Clause 10 dealt with the appointment of Additional Judges. In\n\nexercise of powers conferred by\nArticle 233\nand the Proviso to\nArticle 309\n\nof the Constitution of India, the Governor of Rajasthan made the Rajasthan\n\nHigher Judicial Service Rules, 1969 (“1969 Rules”, for short) in\n\nconsultation with the High Court10 in respect of the Rajasthan Higher\n\nJudicial Service for making appointments, postings and promotions to the\n\ncadre of District Judges, and to provide for other ancillary matters.\n\nThe expressions ‘Direct Recruitment’, ‘District Judge’, ‘Member\n\nof the Service’ and ‘Service’ were defined in Rule 3 as under:-\n\n“(c) “Direct recruitment” means recruitment in\nthe matter prescribed by clause (ii) of rule\n8;\n\n(d)“District Judge” includes Additional\nDistrict Judge, Sessions Judge and\nAdditional Sessions Judge;\n\n………\n\n(f) “Member of the Service” means a person\nappointed in a substantive capacity to a\npost in the service;\n\n………\n\n(h) “Service” means the Rajasthan Higher\nJudicial Service”\n\n10 The High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

Rules 6 to 9\n\nunder said Parts-II and III were as under:-\n\n“6. Strength of the Service.-\n\n(1) The strength of the Service shall, until orders\nvarying the same have been passed under sub-rule\n(2), be as specified in Schedule I.\n\n(2) The strength of the service may be varied by the\nGovernor, from time to time, in consultation with\nthe Court.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule\n(1) and (2), the Governor may, in consultation with\nthe Court, hold any appointment to the service in\nabeyance for such time as he deems fit, without\nthereby entitling any person to compensation.\n\n7.

High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nservice by direct recruitment shall at no time exceed\none third of the total strength of the service.\n\n(2) Subject to the provisions of sub-rule (1), after\nevery three persons appointed by promotion, the\nfourth person shall, as far as possible, be appointed by\ndirect recruitment. If a suitable person is not\navailable for appointment by direct recruitment, the\npost may be filled by promotion from amongst the\nmembers of the Rajasthan Judicial Service.”\n\n3.2. Rules 22 and 23 in Part-III dealt with ‘Temporary or officiating\n\nappointment’ and ‘Appointments to posts in the selection grade’ as under:-\n\n“22. Temporary or officiating appointment.- On the\noccurrence of temporary or permanent vacancies the\nCourt shall recommend the Governor the names of the\ncandidates from amongst the persons who are eligible\nfor appointment to the service by promotion under\nclause (i) of rule 8, for temporary or officiating\nappointment.\n\n23. Appointments to posts in the selection Grade.-\n\nAppointments to the posts in the selection grade of the\nservice shall be made by the Governor in consultation\nwith the Court on the basis of merit.”\n\n3.3. Part IV of 1969 Rules dealt with ‘Seniority’, ‘Probation’ and\n\n‘Confirmation’. Rule 24 dealt with issue of Seniority was as under:-\n\n“24. Seniority.- Subject to the other provisions of\nthese rules, seniority in the service shall be\ndetermined by the date of the order of substantive\nappointment in a permanent vacancy including\nappointment on probation under rule 25:\n\nProvided that a promoted officer who may have been\nallowed to officiate continuously against a permanent\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nvacancy in the cadre from a date, prior to the date of\nappointment of a direct recruit, shall, if he is\nsubsequently selected and substantively appointed in\nthe service, take his seniority in the cadre over such\ndirect recruit:\n\nProvided further that the seniority of candidates\nappointed to the service shall in the case of the\nappointment of more persons than one to the service\nby an order of the same date, follow the order in\nwhich their names have been recommended by the\nCourt.”\n\nSchedule-I to 1969 Rules dealt with ‘Strength of Service’, which\n\nwas stated to be 89 in the post of District & Sessions Judge and Additional\n\nDistrict Sessions Judge, which over a period of time got raised to 150.\n\n4. However, appointments in excess of the strength indicated in\n\nSchedule I to 1969 Rules, were made on various occasions. By\n\nNotification dated 31.03.2001 issued under the provisions of the\n\nOrdinance and under Rule 6(2) of 1969 Rules, 40 Additional District and\n\nSessions Courts were set up in the State for Fast Track disposal of cases\n\npending before the District Judges. By Notification dated 12.07.2002, 13\n\nmore Additional District and Sessions Courts were set up under the\n\naforesaid provisions of the Ordinance and 1969 Rules for Fast Track\n\ndisposal of cases pending before the District Courts. Further, 30\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Courts were again set up on 17.04.2003\n\nin pursuance of aforesaid powers for Fast Track disposal of cases pending\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nbefore the District Judges. Thus 83 Courts were created between\n\n31.03.2001 and 17.04.2003 which are commonly known as Fast Track\n\nCourts and officers from the cadre of Senior Civil Judges were promoted\n\nunder Rule 22 of 1969 Rules to man these Fast Track Courts.\n\nIt may be mentioned that though the decision of this Court in Brij\n\nMohan Lal6 had indicated three sources from which the candidates could\n\nbe appointed to man the Fast Track Courts, in the State of Rajasthan\n\ncandidates were drawn only from one source namely through ad-\n\nhoc/officiating promotions to the persons from the feeder cadre viz.\n\nSenior Civil Judges Cadre. There was no appointment of any retired\n\nJudge or by way of recruitment from the Bar.\n\n5. By Order dated 07.05.2003 issued in compliance of directions of\n\nthis Court in\nAll India Judges Association and others versus Union of\n\nIndia and Others1\nand in accordance with the recommendation of First\n\nNational Judicial Pay Commission, 71 posts were acknowledged to be in\n\n“Selection Scale” while 29 posts were found to be in “Super Time Scale”\n\nin the Higher Judicial Service for the year 2002-2003.\n\n6. On 20.10.2003, a Notification was issued by the High Court\n\nnotifying 19 vacansies for Direct Recruitment to the Higher Judicial\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nService. Out of these 19 vacancies, 11 were shown as current vacancies\n\nwhile 8 were shown as backlog vacancies. A challenge was raised in this\n\nCourt by way of Writ Petition (Civil) No.576 of 2003 by the Association\n\nsubmitting inter alia that there were no vacancies for Direct Recruits and\n\nas such the Notification dated 20.10.2003 was invalid. It was also\n\nsubmitted that as on the date, 220 officers were functioning in the cadre of\n\nDistrict Judges and Additional District Judges.\n\n7. On 13.12.2004, 22 Judicial Officers from the cadre of Senior Civil\n\nJudge were promoted as Additional District and Sessions Judges (Fast\n\nTrack).\n\n8. The matters concerning regular promotion to be granted to the\n\nlevel of District Judge including whether those who were promoted as\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge (Fast Track) under Rule 22 of 1969\n\nRules were being considered by the High Court. A report of a Committee\n\nconstituted to consider said issues was submitted on 23.08.2008. The\n\nmatter was then placed before the Full Court on 29.11.2008 and thereafter\n\nthe matter stood deferred to 13.02.2009, 31.10.2009 and to 23.03.2010\n\nsuccessively.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n9. By order dated 11.01.2008, some Judicial Officers, including the\n\npetitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.464 of 2019, were promoted as\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judges on Ad-hoc basis to man the Fast\n\nTrack Courts. The order stated as under:-\n\n“On the recommendation of Rajasthan High Court,\nH.E. the Governor of State of Rajasthan is pleased to\nappoint/promote the following 37 officers in the cadre\nof R.H.J.S. as Additional District and Sessioins\nJudges on purely ad-hoc basis to man the temporary\nFast Track Courts”.\n\n9.1 A consequential order was thereafter passed on 11.03.2008\n\ndirecting transfer/posting of said Judicial Officers in the rank of\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judges (Fast Track).\n\n9.2 In terms of the decision of Full Court in its Meeting dated\n\n29.11.2008, the period of probation of 34 out of said 37 Judicial Officers\n\nappointed by Order dated 11.01.2008 was extended till further orders.\n\n10. On 07.07.2009, the challenge raised by the Association in Writ\n\nPetition (Civil) No.576 of 2003 was decided by this Court vide its decision\n\nin\nRajasthan Judicial Service Officers’ Association v. State of Rajasthan\n\nand Another11\n. It was observed by this Court that the sanctioned strength\n\nin terms of 1969 Rules was only 150 and as against 25% posts which could\n\n11 (2009) 14 SCC 656\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nbe filled up by Direct Recruitment, 41 Direct Recruits were already\n\nworking in the Higher Judicial Service. It was, therefore, concluded that\n\nthere was no substantive vacancy available for Direct Recruits. The\n\npetition was allowed and the Notification dated 20.10.2003 was set aside.\n\nThe relevant observations of this Court were as under:-\n\n“8. According to the petitioner, the total cadre\nstrength of RHJS is 150 and there are already 41\ndirect recruits working in RHJS. Since the total cadre\nstrength is 150 and since 25% of the posts were\ndirected by the High Court to be filled in by direct\nrecruitment, there were no vacant posts available for\ndirect recruits since 25% of 150 is 37, while 41 direct\nrecruits were already working in RHJS. The petitioner\nalso submitted that if 19 vacancies should be treated\nas 25% of the direct recruitment then there must be at\nleast 57 fresh appointments in RHJS by promotion,\nbut that has not been done.\n\n… … …\n\n11. In our opinion, as held by us in Veena Verma case,\nthe cadre strength is only 150 and not 240 because the\nstrength of the service is as per Rule 6(2) of the\nRajasthan Higher Judicial Service Rules as mentioned\nin Schedule I to the Rules. Until and unless the\nSchedule is amended in accordance with Rule 6(2) the\nstrength of the service cannot be varied, as held by us\nin Veena Verma case12. As yet, we are told, no order\nhas been passed under Rule 6(2).\n\n12. We have also perused the counter-affidavit filed\nby the State of Rajasthan and also the rejoinder-\n\naffidavit filed in the case. It is stated in Para 3 of the\nrejoinder-affidavit that the impugned notification is in\nviolation of the stay order dated 28-9-2000 in Special\nLeave Petition No. 9346 of 1999, staying the\noperation of the order dated 30-4-1999 in DB (C) Spl.\nApplication No. 410 of 1998. It is stated in Para 6 of\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nthe rejoinder-affidavit that there are as on date 220\nofficers functioning in the cadre of District Judges\nand Additional District Judges and as such there are\nno existing vacancies.\n\n13. In our opinion, this writ petition has to be allowed.\nIn view of our decision in Veena Verma case12 it has\nto be held that under the existing Rule the strength of\nthe service of RHJS is 150 and since there are 41\ndirect recruits already working, there is no substantive\nvacancy. Hence the impugned notification is illegal\nand deserves to be quashed. The writ petition is\nallowed and the impugned notification is quashed.\nHowever, we make it clear that it is open to the State\nGovernment in consultation with the High Court to\namend Schedule I to the Rules in accordance with\nRule 6(2) and thereby vary the strength of the service.\n\n14. The petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking a\ndirection to the respondents to complete the selection\nprocess initiated under Notification No. Estt.\n(RJS)/118/2003 dated 20-10-2003. As we have\nquashed the said notification in WP (C) No. 576 of\n2003, this writ petition [WP (C) No. 275 of 2007] is\ndismissed as having become infructuous.”\n\n11. On the same day, a decision was rendered by this Court in High\n\nCourt of\nJudicature For Rajasthan v. Veena Verma and another\n12, which\n\ninter alia considered whether Notification dated 21.12.1996 inviting\n\napplications for 11 posts in the Higher Judicial Service in the State of\n\nRajasthan by Direct Recruitment was valid. It was observed that 11 posts\n\nwere not available for Direct Recruitment. While dealing with the\n\nchallenge, it was observed,\n12 (2009) 14 SCC 734\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n“33. It may be mentioned that posts can be created\ndehors the cadre of a service, and these are known as\nex cadre posts. The posts created without a specific\norder under Rule 6(2) are ex cadre posts. Hence in our\nopinion the temporary or permanent vacancies or\nposts created beyond the number of posts in Schedule\nI without a specific order under Rule 6(2) varying\nSchedule I to the Rules are only ex cadre posts, and\ncan only be filled in by promotees, and not by direct\nrecruitment.\n\n34. It may be noted that Rule 9(2) uses the words “as\nfar as possible”. In our opinion, this means that there\nis no hard-and-fast rule that after every three persons\nappointed by promotion, the fourth person has to be\nappointed by direct recruitment. In our opinion, the\nDivision Bench of the High Court has given a wrong\ninterpretation of Rule 9(2) of the Rules by observing:\n\n“it does not give a licence to the\nrespondents to refuse to appoint every\nfourth person by direct recruitment on the\nground that it was not possible for any other\nreason than the maintenance of the limit of\none-third of the total strength imposed by\nsub-rule (1) of Rule 9 on direct\nrecruitment”.\n\nIn our opinion this is a wrong view taken by the\nDivision Bench of the High Court as is evident from\nthe words “as far as possible” in Rule 9(2). These\nwords give a discretion to the authorities, and the\nCourt cannot interfere with this discretion, unless it is\npalpably arbitrary.\n\n[Emphasis supplied]\n\n35. In our opinion, the Division Bench of the High\nCourt erred in law in holding that for the purpose of\ndirect recruitment the temporary or permanent posts\ncreated outside the cadre without amending Schedule\nI were also to be included while calculating the\nstrength of the Service. The Division Bench also erred\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nin holding that whenever posts are created, the\nstrength of the Service is deemed to have been\nautomatically increased although there is no order\nunder Rule 6(2) in this connection amending Schedule\nI. In our opinion, there has to be a specific order under\nRule 6(2) amending Schedule I otherwise it cannot be\nsaid that the strength of the cadre has been increased.\nHence, in our opinion, the temporary or permanent\nposts created outside the cadre cannot be taken into\nconsideration for determining the strength of the\ncadre.”\n\n12. On 18.01.2010, in exercise of the powers conferred by\nArticles 233\n\nand\nread with proviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution of India, the\n\nGovernor of Rajasthan in consultation with the Rajasthan Public Service\n\nCommission and the High Court made Rules for regulating recruitment to\n\nthe posts in, and the conditions and other matters related to the service of\n\npersons appointed to the Rajasthan Judicial Service. The Rules are called\n\nRajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010 (“2010 Rules”, for short).\n\n12.1 The terms, “Cadre”, “Cadre Post”, “Member of the Service” and\n\n“Substantive appointment” are defined in clauses (b), (c), (g) and (l) of\n\nRule 3 as under:\n\n“Rule 3: Definitions\n\n(b) “Cadre” means the cadre of District Judge, Senior\nCivil Judge and Civil Judge as provided under Rule 5\nof Part-II of these Rules;\n\n(c) “Cadre Post” means any post specified in\nSchedule-I;\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n(g) “Member of the Service” means a person\nappointed substantively to a post in the service under\nthe provisions of these Rules; and\n\n(l) “Substantive appointment” means an appointment\nmade under the provisions of these rules to a\nsubstantive vacancy after due selection by any of the\nmethods of recruitment prescribed under these Rules\nand includes an appointment on probation followed\nby confirmation on completion of the probation\nperiod.”\n\n12.2 Part-II of 2010 Rules deals with “Cadre” and Rule 5 stipulates\n\nthat on and from the date of commencement of the Rules, the Rajasthan\n\nJudicial Service shall stand re-constituted and re-designated into\n\nfollowing three cadres:\n\n(A) District Judges\n\n(B) Senior Civil Judge, and\n\n(C) Civil Judge.\n\nRule 6 deals with “Strength of the Service” and is to the following\neffect.\n\n“(1) The Strength of the Service in each cadre and\nnumber of other posts shall be determined by the\nGovernment from time to time, in consultation with\nthe Court and the existing posts in each cadre in the\nservice shall be as specified in Schedule-I.\n(2) The strength of other posts manned by the\nmembers of the service shall be as specified in\nSchedule-II unless any order varying the same is\nissued under sub-rule(1):\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

Part-III of 2010 Rules deals with subject “General Conditions”\n\nand Rules 7, 8 and 15 are as under :-\n\n“7. Determination of vacancies: (1) subject to the\nprovisions of these rules, the Court shall determine\nand notify the actual number of existing and expected\nvacancies in each cadre as per the time schedule\nspecified in Schedule-III.\n\n(2) Where the vacancies in the cadre are to be filled in\nby a single method, the vacancies so determined shall\nbe filled by that method.\n\n(3) Where the vacancies in the cadre are to be filled in\nby more than one method, the apportionment of\nvacancies determined under sub-rule (1), to each such\nmethod shall be done maintaining the prescribed\npercentage for the particular method taking into\naccount consideration the overall number of posts\nalready filled in:\n\nProvided that the apportionment for filling up\nvacancies in the cadre of District Judge, shall be made\nin a cyclic order of respective quota of each category,\ni.e. Promotee on the basis of merit-cum-seniority,\nPromotee on the basis of Limited Competitive\nExamination and the Direct Recruitee.\n\n8. Examination:- For filling up of vacancies in the\ncadre of District Judge and Civil Judge, examination\nshall be conducted by the Recruiting Authority as per\nthe time Schedule specified in Schedule III.\n\n………\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

Part IV deals with “Methods of Recruitment” under which\n\n“Recruitment to the cadre of Civil Judge” and “Recruitment to the cadre\n\nof Senior Civil Judge” are dealt with in Rules 16 to 30 of sub-Parts A and\n\nB, while “Recruitment to the cadre of District Judge” is dealt with under\n\nsub-Part C. Rule 31 deals with source of recruitment, as under:-\n\n“31. Source of recruitment: (1) Fifty percent posts in\nthe cadre of District Judge shall be filled in by\npromotion from amongst Senior Civil Judges on the\nbasis of merit-cum-seniority subject to passing of\nsuitability test as provided under Schedule-IV.\n\n(2) Twenty five percent posts in the cadre of District\nJudge shall be filled in by promotion from Senior\nCivil Judges strictly on the basis of merit through\nlimited competitive examination conducted by the\nCourt.\n\n(3) Twenty Five percent posts in the cadre of District\nJudge shall be filled in by direct recruitment from\namongst the eligible Advocates on the basis of written\nexamination and interview conducted by the Court.\n\n(4) For the purpose of proper maintenance and\ndetermination of seniority of persons appointed\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

This roster shall operate prospectively.”\n\n12.5. Thereafter the relevant subjects are dealt with under three sub-\n\nheads named as (I) Promotion, (II) Direct Recruitment and (III)\n\nAppointment. Rule 32 dealing with the “Recruitment by Promotion” is\n\nas under:\n\n“32. Recruitment by promotion:- (1) Fifty percent\nposts in the Cadre of District Judge shall be filled in\nby promotion from amongst Senior Civil Judges\nrecommended by the Court, on the basis of merit-\ncum-seniority, subject to passing of suitability test as\nprovided in Schedule-VI.\n\nExplanation: “Qualifying the eligibility test shall not\naffect the inter-se-seniority of the officers in the Cadre\nof Senior Civil Judge.\n\n(2) The recruitment in the cadre of District Judges\nunder sub-rule (2) of rule 31 shall be made by a\nLimited Competitive Examination conducted by the\nCourt in accordance with the scheme of the\nexamination prescribed under Schedule-VIII.\n\n(3) A Senior Civil Judge who has completed actual\nfive years service as on the first day of January\npreceding the last date fixed for the receipt of the\napplications shall be eligible for appearing in the\nLimited Competitive Examination for promotion to\nthe Cadre of District Judge.\n\n(4) For the purpose of Limited Competitive\nExamination, applications shall be invited by the\nCourt from all eligible Senior Civil Judges in such\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

Repeal and savings: The Rajasthan Highter\nJudicial Service Rules, 1969 and the Rajasthan\nJudicial Service Rules, 1955, as amended from time\nto time, are hereby repealed:\n\nProvided that such repeal shall not affect any\norder made, action taken, effects and consequences of\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

On 31.03.2010 a Notification was issued by the High Court\n\nnotifying 58 vacancies to be filled in the cadre of District Judge. Out of 58\n\nvacancies so notified, 36 vacancies were to be filled by the Direct\n\nRecruitment from the Bar while remaining 22 vacancies were to be filled\n\nby promotion through LCE as provided in Rules 7, 8, 32(1) and 40(1)\n\nalong with Schedule-II to 2010 Rules.

It must be noted that the\n\n47 Judicial Officers were not intimated by the High Court that they could\n\nappear at LCE to be conducted in pursuance of the Notification dated\n\n15.04.2010. The Order recited as under:-\n\n“On the recommendation of Rajasthan High Court,\nH.E. the Government of State of Rajasthan is pleased\nto appoint/promote the following 47 officers as\nAdditional District and Sessions Judges in the District\nJudge Cadre.”\n\nOn the same day i.e. on 21.04.2010 another Order was issued\n\npromoting 49 Senior Civil Judges, including the petitioner in Writ Petition\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

The candidates who had applied in pursuance of the Notification\n\ndated 15.04.2010 appeared at the written examination held on 30.06.2010\n\nand the successful candidates were then called for interview. However, by\n\ncommunication dated 04.09.2010 interviews were postponed sine die.\n\nLater, by Notification dated 22.09.2010 which was issued in pursuance of\n\nthe Resolution of the Full Court, the entire examination process for\n\nrecruitment by Direct Recruitment and through LCE was directed to be\n\nheld afresh.\n\n18. A Notification was issued on 31.03.2011 renotifying the number of\n\nvacancies available for Direct Recruitment and for promotion through\n\nLCE. Said Notification was as under:-\n\n“RAJASTHAN HIGH COURT JODHPUR\n\nNOTIFICATION\n\nAs per the determination of vacancies for the current\nyear & the strength of District Judge cadre being 245,\nthe vacancies in the District Judge cadre as hereby\nnotified as under:-\n\nVacancies for Direct Recruitment - 37\nVacancies for promotion by Limited\nCompetitive Examination - 22\nVacancies for promotion - 24\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

A Bench of three Judges of this Court after noting its earlier\n\nJudgment in\nAll India Judges’ Association vs. Union of India and\n\nOthers1\nmodified certain directions contained therein by its Order dated\n\n20.04.20109. The relevant paragraphs have already been quoated in\n\nparagraph 2.6 hereinabove.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n20. On 10.06.2011, appropriate amendments were effected in 2010\n\nRules to fix the quota for Promotees at 65% in accordance with the\n\naforesaid Order dated 20.04.20109 issued by this Court and raising the\n\ncadre strength of District Judges from 245 to 255.\n\n21.\nIn\nBrij Mohan Lal v. Union of India and Others\n14, this Court inter\n\nalia dealt with two Transferred Cases, one arising from Writ Petition filed\n\nin the High Court of Punjab and Haryana seeking directions to stop the\n\nscheme and policy of appointment of retired District and Sessions Judges\n\nas Ad-hoc Judges of the Fast Track Courts and the other filed in the High\n\nCourt of Andhra Pradesh seeking declaration that constitution of Fast\n\nTrack Courts was unconstitutional and consequently be set aside. This\n\nCourt considered the entire scheme as well as the relevant provisions in\n\nvarious States and considered diverse submissions. One of the questions\n\nraised by this Court was:-\n\n“Whether any of the appointees to the post of ad\nhoc Judges under the FTC Scheme have a right to the\npost in the context of the facts of the present case?”\n\n21.1 Thereafter, the letters of appointment issued to various appointees\n\nincluding those from the State of Rajasthan were considered and while\n\n14 (2012) 6 SCC 502\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\ndealing with the issue of regularization of service rendered by the Judicial\n\nOfficers’ manning Fast Track Courts, it was observed:-\n\n“172. The prayer for regularisation of service and\nabsorption of the petitioner appointees against the\nvacancies appearing in the regular cadre has been\nmade not only in cases involving the case of the State\nof Orissa, but even in other States. Absorption in\nservice is not a right. Regularisation also is not a\nstatutory or a legal right enforceable by the persons\nappointed under different rules to different posts.\nRegularisation shall depend upon the facts and\ncircumstances of a given case as well as the relevant\nrules applicable to such class of persons.”\n\n21.2 In so far as the State of Rajasthan is concerned, it was observed:-\n\n“177. In the case of State of Rajasthan, it is the\njudicial officers from the cadre of Civil Judge, Senior\nDivision, who were promoted as FTC Judges. They\nhave continued to hold those posts for a considerable\nperiod. According to these petitioners, they were\npromoted to the Higher Judicial Services as per the\nRules and, therefore, keeping in view the order of this\nCourt in Madhumita Das15 as well as the very essence\nof the FTC Scheme, they should be absorbed as\nmembers of the regular cadre of Higher Judicial\nServices of the State of Rajasthan. The State\nGovernment had issued a directive that they should\nundertake the limited competitive examination for\ntheir regular promotion/absorption in the higher cadre.\nThese officers questioned the correctness of this\ndirective on the ground that they were promoted as\nAdditional Sessions Judges (FTC) under the Rules\nand, therefore, there was no question of any further\nrequirement for them to take any written examination\nafter the long years of service that they have already\nput in in the Higher Judicial Services.\n\n15 (2008) 6 SCC 731\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n178. The Rajasthan Judicial Service Rules, 2010\nare in force for appointment to the Higher Judicial\nServices of the State. The judgment of this Court in\nAll India Judges’ Assn. (3) case 1 as well as the\nrelevant Rules contemplate that a person who is to be\ndirectly appointed to the Higher Judicial Services has\nto undergo a written examination and appear in an\ninterview before he can be appointed to the said\ncadre. As far as appointment by promotion is\nconcerned, the promotion can be made by two\ndifferent modes i.e. on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\nmerit or through out-of-turn promotion wherein any\nCivil Judge, Senior Division who has put in five years\nof service is required to take a competitive\nexamination and then to the extent of 25% of the\nvacancies available, such Judges would be promoted\nto the Higher Judicial Services.\n\n179. It was admitted before us by the learned\ncounsel appearing for the petitioners that these\nofficers who were promoted as ad hoc FTC Judges\nhad not taken any written competitive examination\nbefore their promotion to this post under the Higher\nJudicial Services. In other words, they were promoted\non ad hoc basis depending on the availability of\nvacancy in FTCs. Once the Rules required a particular\nprocedure to be adopted for promotion to the regular\nposts of the Higher Judicial Services, then the\ncompetent authority can effect the promotion only by\nthat process and none other. In view of the admitted\nfact that these officers have not taken any written\nexamination, we see no reason as to how the\nchallenge made by these judicial officers to the\ndirective issued by the State Government for\nundertaking of written examination may be sustained.\nThus, the relief prayed for cannot be granted in its\nentirety.”\n\n21.3 Finally, following directions were issued in paragraph 207:-\n\n“207. Without any intent to interfere with the\npolicy decision taken by the Governments, but\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon.

It is directed that all the States, henceforth,\nshall not take a decision to continue the FTC Scheme\non ad hoc and temporary basis. The States are at\nliberty to decide but only with regard either to bring\nthe FTC Scheme to an end or to continue the same as\na permanent feature in the State.\n\n207.5. The Union of India and the State\nGovernments shall reallocate and utilise the funds\napportioned by the 13th Finance Commission and/or\nmake provisions for such additional funds to ensure\nregularisation of the FTC Judges in the manner\nindicated and/or for creation of additional courts as\ndirected in this judgment.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

No decision, recommendation or proposal\nmade by the Chief Justices and Chief Ministers’\nConference shall be rejected or declined or varied at\nany bureaucratic level, in the hierarchy of the\nGovernments, whether in the State or the Centre.\n\n207.8. We hereby direct that it shall be for the\nCentral Government to provide funds for carrying out\nthe directions contained in this judgment and, if\nnecessary, by reallocation of funds already allocated\nunder the 13th Finance Commission for judiciary. We\nfurther direct that for creation of additional 10% posts\nof the existing cadre, the burden shall be equally\nshared by the Centre and the State Governments and\nfunds be provided without any undue delay so that the\ncourts can be established as per the schedule directed\nin this judgment.\n\n207.9.

The examination and\ninterview shall be held in accordance with the\nrelevant Rules enacted by the States for direct\nappointment to Higher Judicial Services.\n\n(d) Each of the appointees shall be entitled\nto one mark per year of service in the FTCs,\nwhich shall form part of the interview marks.\n\n(e) Needless to point out that this\nexamination and interview should be conducted\nby the respective High Courts keeping in mind\nthat all these applicants have put in a number of\nyears as FTC Judges and have served the country\nby administering justice in accordance with law.\nThe written examination and interview module,\nshould, thus, be framed keeping in mind the\npeculiar facts and circumstances of these cases.\n\n(f) The candidates who qualify the written\nexamination and obtain consolidated percentage\nas aforeindicated shall be appointed to the post of\nAdditional District Judge in the regular cadre of\nthe State.\n\n(g) If, for any reason, vacancies are not\navailable in the regular cadre, we hereby direct\nthe State Governments to create such additional\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

Keeping in view the need of the hour and\nthe constitutional mandate to provide fair and\nexpeditious trial to all litigants and the citizens of the\ncountry, we direct the respective States and the\nCentral Government to create 10% of the total regular\ncadre of the State as additional posts within three\nmonths from today and take up the process for filling\nsuch additional vacancies as per the Higher Judicial\nService and Judicial Services Rules of that State,\nimmediately thereafter.\n\n207.12.

A Notification was issued on 31.03.2015 by the High Court\n\ndetermining cumulative vacancies in the cadre of District Judge for the\n\nyears 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 as under:-\n\n“In supersession of earlier Notification No.Estt.\n(RJS)/33/2014 dated 01.04.2014, as per Schedule-1 of\nRJS Rules, 2010, the cumulative vacancies in District\njudge cadre for the years 2012-13, 2-13-14, 2014-15\n& 2015-16 are hereby determined and notified as\nunder:-\n\nAs per cadre strength 372\n\nTotal Vacancies = 207+21 228\n\nVacancies for Direct Recruitment 44\nVacancies for promotion by Limited\n\nCompetitive Examination 29\n\nVacancies for promotion 134\n\n*Note:- 21 future vacancies (against 10% of the total\nNumber of vacancies) are not assigned to any\ncategory for the present.

This Select List in cyclic order has been\nprepared of the candidates being recommended\nfor appointment while leaving eight posts unfilled\nfor eight Sr. Civil Judges, failing in the zone of\nconsideration for promotion on merit-cum-\nseniority basis as their consideration has been\ndeferred due to pendency of departmental\nenquiries against them.

The petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.895 of 2019, Writ\n\nPetition (Civil) No.897 of 2019 and Writ Petition (Civil) No.899 of 2019\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nwere promoted to the cadre of District Judge by aforesaid order dated\n\n05.02.2016.\n\n27. Thereafter, a Provisional Seniority List was issued vide\n\ncommunication dated 16.08.2017 as regards Judicial Officers from Serial\n\nNos. 206 onwards. The communication recited as under:-\n\n“TENTATIVE DETERMINATION OF SENIORITY\nOF THE OFFICERS OF DISTRICT JUDGE\nCADRE.\n\n****\nFinal Seniority List of the officers of District Judge\nCadre upto Shri Nagendra Pal Bhandari was\npublished on 15.12.2014.\n\nAfter taking into consideration, the representations\nreceived from the officers of different categories and\nall relevant provisions, the tentative/provisional\nseniority list of the officers of District Judge Cadre\nnext to Shri Nagendra Pal Bhandari is\nreckoned/proposed:”\n\nThe names of all the concerned candidates were mentioned in the\n\nProvisional Seniority List. The candidates, who were successful in LCE\n\nwere given the original order of Seniority in the feeder cadre without\n\ngiving them any benefit for having successfully cleared the LCE. Further\n\nthe 47 Judicial Officers promoted on 21.04.2010 were en-bloc placed\n\nabove all the appointees pursuant to selection undertaken in 2011.\n\n28. In August 2018, Writ Petition Nos.936 of 2018 and 967 of 2018\n\nnamely Writ Petitions in Categories A and B referred to in Para 1\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nhereinabove were filed in this Court submitting inter alia that post the\n\ncoming into effect of 2010 Rules, all the appointments in the categories of\n\nselection through LCE and Direct Recruitment had to be in conformity\n\nwith 2010 Rules and in tune with the Cyclic Order; that placement of the\n\n47 Judicial Officers whose Appointment Orders were issued after the\n\nprocess was undertaken in the year 2010 for selection of candidates\n\nthrough LCE and Direct Recruitment, was not correct.\n\n29. Notice was issued by this Court in aforesaid Writ Petition (Civil)\n\nNos.936 of 2018 and 967 of 2018 on 20.09.2018. On 14.12.2018 the\n\nlearned counsel for the High Court submitted that the objections to the\n\nProvisional Lists were pending consideration with the High Court.\n\nTherefore, at his request the petitions were adjourned. Thereafter, the\n\nentire matter was considered by the High Court and by its Report dated\n\n15.03.2019 all the objections raised by the concerned candidates were dealt\n\nwith. The report was thereafter placed on record. On 18.07.2019 when said\n\nWrit Petitions and all other connected matters were taken up, it was\n\nhighlighted that the 47 Judicial Officers were not promoted in conformity\n\nwith Rule 32(1) of 2010 Rules, and, in any case, the principle of Cyclic\n\nOrder, in terms of Rule 42, was also not complied with and yet they were\n\nplaced at Serial Nos.206 to 250. Since the 47 Judicial Officers were not\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nparties to the present proceedings, notice was issued to them by Order\n\ndated 18.07.2019.\n\n30. In the meantime, the Report of the Committee of five Judges of the\n\nHigh Court under the Chairmanship of the Chief Justice of the High Court\n\nwhich had considered all the representations was placed on record. The\n\nCommittee had framed following four questions for its consideration in\n\nsaid Report dated 15.03.2019:-\n\n(1) Whether the officers, who were promoted\non the post of Additional District Judge\n(Fast Track) on ad-hoc basis under Rule 22\nof the Rules of 1969, can claim seniority\nfrom the date of such ad-hoc promotion in\nview of the first proviso to Rule 24 of the\nRules of 1969, by virtue of saving clause\nin Rule 57 of the Rules of 2010, which\nwere enforced on 19.01.2010?\n\n(2) Whether the process of selection for direct\nrecruitment against 36 posts determined in\nthe year 2010-11 should be taken to have\ncommenced from 15.04.2010 when initial\nadvertisement for recruitment was issued\nor from 19.07.2011 when fresh\nadvertisement was issued after earlier\nprocess was cancelled with the decision of\nthe High Court to hold the process of\nrecruitment afresh?\n\n(3) Whether seniority of officers of the same\nbatch promoted to the District Judge cadre\nin the Limited Competitive Examination\nquota, should be prepared on the basis of\ntheir inter-se placement in the merit list of\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nsuch examination under Rule 32(2) or\nshould be, in view of Rule 47(4) of the\nRules of 2010, the same as it was in Senior\nCivil Judge cadre?\n\n(4) Whether seniority of the officers promoted\nto the District Judge cadre in view of Rule\n31(4), is required to be fixed in cyclic\norder as per roster given in Schedule V to\nRules of 2010 with adherence to quota-\n\nrota rule and what bearing in the facts of\nthe case, the opening words “As far as\npossible” in Rule 42 of the Rules, would\nhave on determination of seniority?\n\n30.1 Before dealing with the aforesaid four questions, the scope of the\n\nmatter was dealt with as under:-\n\n“The Rajasthan High Court notified the\nprovisional seniority list of the officers of the\nDistrict Judge cadre next to Shri Nagendra Pal\nSingh Bhandari on 16.08.2017, inviting\nobjections thereto. This seniority list started\nfrom Shri N.S. Dhaddha at serial no.206 and\ncontinued upto Shri Mohammad Arif at serial\nno.519. Recruitment to District Judge cadre is\nmade by three methods – 65% by promotion,\n10% by Limited Competitive Examination (for\nshort, ‘LCE), both from amongst the Senior\nCivil Judges and 25% by direct recruitment from\nthe members of the Bar. The officers from all\nthe three streams submitted their written\nobjections to the provisional seniority list.\nMeeting of the Committee was convened under\nthe Chairmanship of the Chief Justice in the\nCommittee Hall of the High Court premises at\nJodhpur on 06.01.2019. Their oral submissions\nwere also heard in support of the written\nobjections already submitted.\n\n… … …\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nWe may at the outset make it clear that we do\nnot wish to unsettle the seniority position which\nhas attained finality insofar as final seniority list\ndated 15.12.2014 is concerned, because no one\nfrom any of the three streams of recruitment has\never challenged the same before any forum\nknown to law. However, at the same time, we\nwish to make it clear at this stage itself that\nwhile deciding the objections as to correctness\nof the provisional seniority list dated\n16.08.2017, we may not agree and may deviate\nfrom the principles on which the conclusions of\nthe earlier seniority committee in its report are\nfounded.”\n\n30.2 With regard to first question the conclusion arrived at by the\n\nCommittee was as under:-\n\n“In view of the position of law discussed above,\nwe are not persuaded to countenance the\nsubmission that the promotes against the posts\noutside the cadre should be taken to have been\npromoted from the date of their ad hoc\npromotion either in the fast track courts or any\nother court, for the purpose of grant of seniority\nwith reference to proviso to Rule 24 even though\ntheir regular promotion has actually taken place\nafter the Rules of 1969 were repealed and the\nRules of 2010 were promulgated on 19.01.2010.\nWe also cannot uphold the argument that any\nright stood crystalized in favour of such\npromotes by reason of prescription made in\nproviso to Rule 24 and such right, by virtue of\nthe savings clause under Rule 57 of the Rules of\n2010, would remain protected so as to entitle\nthem to claim seniority from the date of initial\npromotion on ad hoc basis even if their regular\npromotion has taken place later than the\npromulgation of the Rules of 2010. We are not\nexamining the correctness of the order granting\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nselection scale to certain officers by counting the\nad hoc service towards requisite period of five\nyears, but that cannot justify giving the benefit\nof seniority on the basis of ad hoc promotion in\nview of the interpretation of the extant rules we\nhave taken in the light of settled proposition of\nlaw. In our considered view, all those who were\npromoted on ad hoc basis earlier under the Rules\nof 1969, prior to promulgation of the Rules of\n2010, can be given seniority only from the date\nof their substantive appointment, upon regular\npromotion, which took place after the Rules of\n2010 came into force with effect from\n19.01.2010. There is therefore no legal\njustification for en-bloc placement of such\nofficers in the provisional seniority list on the\nbasis of revision of cadre strength, when\ntemporary/permanent posts included in the cadre\nwith increase of its strength from 150 to 245 and\nevery time later when the cadre strength was\nrevised from 246 to 255, 256 to 265 and 266 to\n372 respectively.”\n\n30.3 With regard to second question the conclusion was as under:-\n\n“In the case at hand, it should be noted that the\nprocess of recruitment was initially notified vide\nadvertisement dated 15.04.2010, but the entire\nselection process both by direct recruitment as\nwell by promotion through LCE was abandoned\npursuant to decision of the Full Court, which is\nevident from the order of the Registrar General\nof the Rajasthan High Court dated 22.09.2010,\nwhereby it was decided that recruitment process\nshall be initiated afresh. New process of\nselection/recruitment was started in both these\ncategories by notification dated 19.07.2011. Out\nof 41 candidates, who were selected in the year\n2013 by way of direct recruitment pursuant to\nthe said notification, there are at least 15 such\ncandidates, whose names did not find place\neither in the eligibility list or rejection list, as per\nthe information furnished by the Examination\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nCell of the High Court. These names are – (1)\nShri Malkhan Singh, (2) Shri Ram Suresh\nPrasad, (3) Shri Manchha Ram Suthar, (4) Shri\nKeshav Kaushik, (5) Shri Dinesh Tyagi, (6) Shri\nHariom Sharma Attri, (7) Shri Arun Kumar\nBeriwal, (8) Shri Hukam Singh Rajpurohit, (9)\nMs. Shivani Singh, (10) Shri Mashroor Alam\nKhan, (11) Ramesh Prashad Choudhary, (12)\nMs. Meenakshi Sharma, (13) Ms. Anu\nAggarwal, (14) Shri Kishan Chand, and (15)\nShri Satish Kumar. This proves that either they\nwere not eligible, or even if eligible, they did not\napply in response to the earlier notification for\nrecruitment dated 15.04.2010. We are therefore\nnot inclined to uphold the claim of direct recruits\nthat they should be conferred the benefit of\nseniority from the year 2010. In any event, the\ndirect recruits cannot claim seniority earlier than\ninitiation of fresh process of selection pursuant\nto notification dated 19.07.2011 during the year\n2011-12. The result of this would be that these\ndirect recruits would not be entitled to claim\nseniority over at least those 47 officers, who\nwere promoted on regular basis vide order dated\n21.04.2010 in the year 2010-11 after the Rules\nof 2010 came into force. The direct recruits\ncannot therefore claim seniority above those\nofficers, who were promoted on regular basis\nsoon after promulgation of the Rules of 2010,\nwhen they were not even borne on the cadre.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n30.4 While dealing with third question the Committee concluded:-\n\n“…We are therefore of the view that merit of\nthose promoted through LCE should by virtue of\nRule 32(2) be considered as the benchmark for\npromotion, inter-se seniority amongst them in\nthe feeder cadre being maintained by\nprescription of Rule 47(4), subject to the\nexception that if an officer by regular method of\npromotion is able to otherwise secure promotion\nin the same year in the regular line on his turn\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nand on that basis he gets a higher placement in\nthe seniority, regardless of his selection in the\nLCE, he should not be put to a disadvantageous\nposition and allowed to retain his position in the\nseniority based on his regular promotion. In\nother words, such officer would be entitled to\nretain seniority, either on the basis of LCE or on\nthe basis of regular promotion, whichever is\nmore beneficial to him.”\n\n30.5 Finally, while dealing with fourth question, the Committee took\n\ninto account that there was no actual recruitment in the years 2012-13,\n\n2013-14 and 2014-15 and the recruitment process commenced by the\n\nNotification dated 26.04.2015 was with regard to vacancies of all four\n\nyears i.e. 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. In the circumstances, it\n\nwas concluded:-\n\n“As far as the period subsequent to the roster order\ndated 15.07.2013 is concerned, the determination of\nvacancies was made every year fairly regularly as\nnoticed above, but actual recruitment from none of the\nthree modes could take place in any one of the years\n2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15. Finally again the\nrecruitment process commenced by notification dated\n26.04.2015 in the year 2015-16. Since the vacancies\nof all four years, viz., 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 and\n2015-16, were combined, even if some of the officers\nwere in between allowed to continue on the post of\nAdditional District & Sessions Judge on ad hoc basis,\nthey cannot in view of the afore-discussed provisions\nof the Rules claim seniority on that basis. The\nvacancies of all these four years having been\ndetermined as those of the year 2015-16, all the\nappointments, by direct recruitment, LCE or regular\npromotion, should be deemed to belong to the year\n2015-16.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n…. …. …\n\nPerusal of the provisional seniority list shows that all\n56 officers starting from Shri Satish Kumar Vyas\n(S.No.369) upto Shri Jai Prakash Narain Purohit\n(S.No.423), promoted on ad hoc basis vide order\ndated 21.04.2014 as Additional District Judge in the\nDJ cadre under Rule 15 of the Rules of 2010, have\nbeen wrongly assigned higher seniority. Thereafter, 26\nofficers starting from Shri Paras Kumar Jain\n(S.No.4224) upto Shri Jagendra Kumar Agarwal\n(S.No.450), all promoted on ad hoc basis by order\ndated 21.04.2015 also have been wrongly assigned\nhigher seniority in the provisional seniority list. The\nnext slot of officers starting from Shri Ashok Kumar\nAgarwal (S.No.451) onwards though have been\npromoted on regular basis by order dated 05.02.2016,\nbut they have been all placed en-bloc senior to those\nwho were selected against direct recruitment quota.\nSurprisingly, the cadre strength was initially increased\nwith the enforcement of the Rules of 2010 on\n19.01.2010, but the High Court administration has\napplied the same analogy of revision of cadre strength\neven on three subsequent occasions for placing all the\nofficers appointed on ad hoc basis en-bloc in the\nseniority above those directly recruited. Some of the\nofficers, who though got regular promotion vide order\ndated 05.02.2016, deviating from the roster point\nindicated in the order of promotion dated 05.02.2016,\nhave been placed en-bloc above the officers of direct\nrecruitment and LCE quota by wrongly applying the\nproviso to Rule 24 as if this repealed Rule would\nperpetually survive by mere reason of ad hoc\npromotions, for each succeeding year. Grant of benefit\nof seniority to officers promoted on ad hoc basis was\nthus contrary to the provisions contained in Rule 15\nand 47(4).\n\nTaking all the aforementioned circumstances into\naccount, we are inclined to hold that each of the years\n2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 for the purpose of\noperating the roster system should be treated as zero\nrecruitment year and that the recruitment against\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\ncombined 207 vacancies determined for these years\nand the year 2015-16, should be taken as the\nvacancies of the year 2015-16 so as to make the Rule\n42 of the Rules of 2010 workable, which begins with\nthe phraseology “As far as possible”, a select list as\nprovided in Schedule-V shall be prepared by the High\nCourt. Such select list in the cyclic order as per the\nroster point was earlier prepared by order dated\n15.07.2013 and also when the next regular selections\ntook place vide order dated 05.02.2016 but this was\nnot truly reflected in the seniority list. All the officers\npromoted on regular basis by order dated 05.02.2016\nshould be taken to have been substantively appointed\nfrom that date only. If this view is taken, no prejudice\nwould be caused to any class of the officers as none of\nthem would compete for promotion/appointment in\ntheir respective category in previous three years.\nVacancies of all these three years having been clubbed\nwith the vacancies of the year 2015-16 to be\ndetermined as the vacancies of that year, each one of\nthem has had opportunity to compete with his fellow\nofficers/candidates for substantive appointment by\nway of promotion/LCE/direct-recruitment, to the DJ\ncadre together.”\n\n31. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Advocate and Mr. A.D.N. Rao,\n\nlearned Advocate for the petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.936 of\n\n2018, and Mr. P.S. Patwalia and Mr. Nitesh Gupta, learned Senior\n\nAdvocates for the petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.967 of 2018\n\nsubmitted that in terms of the provisions of 2010 Rules, any appointments\n\nmade after said Rules came into effect, had to be in conformity with the\n\nprinciples therein and in accordance with the percentages for three\n\ndifferent sources set out therein. It was submitted that before 2010 Rules\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\ncame into effect, the strength of the cadre of District Judge in the State\n\nwas 150 and it got raised to 245 only after 2010 Rules came into effect.\n\nRelying on the decisions of this Court in Debabrata Dash and Another v.\n\nJatindra Prasad Das and Others16, V. Venkata Prasad and Others v.\n\nHigh Court of A.P. and Other17 and in\nKum C. Yamini v. The State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh18\n, it was submitted that no service rendered on ad-hoc\n\nbasis as Fast Track Court Judges could be counted and that the rights\n\nof such candidates to be considered for promotion arose only after\n\n2010 Rules and that since the Notification dated 31.03.2010\n\nnotified vacancies to be filled up by Direct Recruitment and\n\nthrough LCE, the High Court could not have promoted the 47 Judicial\n\nOfficers by Order dated 21.04.2010 so as to adversely affect the chances\n\nand status of the petitioners. It was submitted that the entire exercise must\n\nbe taken to be one single package under which appointments through all\n\nthree sources could be undertaken after the vacancies became available by\n\nenhancement of cadre strength; and that the entire exercise undertaken\n\nafter issuance of the Notification on 31.03.2011 was nothing but\n\ncontinuation of what was contemplated by the Notification dated\n\n15.04.2010. It was, therefore, submitted that the vacancies which were\n16 (2013) 3 SCC 658\n17 (2016) 11 SCC 656\n18 (2019) 10 SCALE 834 = 2019(8 ) JT 365\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v.

High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nsubject matter of Notification dated 31.03.2011 and the posting of the 47\n\nJudicial Officers pursuant to Order dated 21.04.2010 must be considered\n\nas part of the same process. Resultantly, the placement of the concerned\n\ncandidates ought to be governed by the Cyclic Order enumerated in\n\nSchedule VII to 2010 Rules. Reliance was placed on the decision of this\n\nCourt in\nUnion of India and Others v. N. R. Parmar and Others19\n.\n\nMr. Nikhil Singhvi, learned Advocate for the petitioners in Writ\n\nPetition (Civil) Diary No.13252 of 2019 added another dimension in\n\nrespect of LCE candidates. It was submitted that in keeping with the\n\ndirections issued by this Court in para 28 in All India Judges’\n\nAssociation1 the promotions through LCE must be “strictly on the basis of\n\nmerit” and that Rule 31(2) of 2010 Rules translates the same principle\n\nand, therefore, the ranking of the candidates who had cleared LCE must\n\nbe in accordance with merit and not in accordance with their inter se\n\nseniority in the erstwhile cadre.\n\n32. On the other hand, Mr. R. Balasubramanian, learned Senior\n\nAdvocate and Ms. Prerna Singh, learned Advocate appearing for the 47\n\ncandidates submitted that said candidates were promoted well before the\n\n19 (2012) 13 SCC 340\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\ninitiation of selection process initiated pursuant to the Notification dated\n\n31.03.2011; that said Notification was not in continuation of the process\n\ninitiated in 2010; that number of candidates who were selected in the\n\nselection process pursuant to the Notification dated 31.03.2011 had not\n\neven participated in the process initiated in 2010 and the Committee of the\n\nHigh Court in its Report dated 15.03.2019 rightly answered Question\n\nNo.2 in the negative. In their submission, the issue of regular promotion\n\nof those who were manning the Fast Track Court on ad-hoc basis was\n\nalways under consideration right from 23.08.2008 when a Committee of\n\nthe High Court had made its recommendations. In the process, the case of\n\nthe 47 candidates stood on a completely different footing and the\n\nCommittee of the High Court in its Report dated 15.03.2019 rightly\n\nacknowledged their entitlement.\n\n33. Mr. Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the\n\npetitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.464 of 2019 submitted that all these\n\npetitioners were appointed on ad-hoc basis as Fast Track Court Judges in\n\nthe year 2008 and as a matter of fact, 4 Judicial Officers who were also\n\nappointed along with these petitioners in the year 2008 were part of the list\n\nof the 47 candidates at Serial Nos.44 to 47 whereas these petitioners were\n\nnot included in said list. These Petitioners, therefore, pray that the order\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\ndated 15.03.2019 be set aside to the extent it deprived said petitioners of\n\ntheir rightful due and they be given seniority from their initial appointment\n\nas Judges of the Fast Track Court that is from 11.01.2008 or, at least, above\n\nall LCE candidates and Direct Recruits as was given to the 47 candidates.\n\nIt was further submitted that out of 83 Fast Track Courts which were\n\nmentioned in Part A of Schedule II to 2010 Rules, 40 Courts were\n\nabolished on 31.03.2011 and the petitioners were continued as Additional\n\nDistrict Judges against vacant regular posts vide Order dated 31.03.2011.\n\nHowever, their substantive promotion to the Cadre of District Judge was\n\nmade on 15.07.2013 along with the Direct Recruits and candidates through\n\nLCE. It was submitted that their initial appointments being under 1969\n\nRules and the fact that they were occupying posts indicated in Part A of\n\nSchedule II as stated above, their case would be covered by Rule 57 of\n\n2010 Rules. It was however accepted that some of the petitioners had\n\nparticipated in the LCE around that time.\n\n34. Mr. Neeraj Jain, learned Senior Advocate for the Association in\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.1471 of 2018 submitted that as acknowledged in\n\nthe decision of this Court in Rajasthan Judicial Service Officers\n\nAssociation11 there were 41 Direct Recruits in the Cadre of District Judges\n\nin the year 2009 and as such it was incorrect to assess the vacancies for\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nDirect Recruits in the Notifications dated 15.04.2010 and 31.03.20111 at\n\nthe level of 36 and 37 respectively. In his submission the allocation of\n\nvacancies to Direct Recruits was in excess of their entitlement.\n\n35. Mr. V.K. Shukla, learned Senior Advocate appeared for the\n\npetitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.899 of 2019, who were promoted on\n\nad-hoc basis as Additional District and Sessions Judges to man the Fast\n\nTrack Courts on 21.04.2010 i.e. after 2010 Rules had come into force and\n\nwho were substantively promoted to the Cadre of District Judge by Order\n\ndated 05.02.2016. It was submitted that their services at the level of\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge were continued even after\n\nabolition of Fast Track Courts and thus said petitioners ought to be given\n\nthe benefit of past service and be conferred appropriate seniority.\n\n36. Dr. Sumant Bhardwaj, learned Advocate appeared for the\n\npetitioner in Writ Petition (Civil) No.1008 of 2019, where the petitioner\n\nstands on similar footing as in Writ Petition (Civil) No.899 of 2019, in\n\nthat the ad-hoc promotion to the Cadre of District Judge was granted in\n\nthe year 2012.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n37. Dr. Manish Singhvi, and Mr. Sanjay Hegde, learned Senior\n\nAdvocates appearing for the State and the High Court respectively\n\nsupported the actions taken by the High Court on the administrative side.\n\n38. In the backdrop of the facts and circumstances on record and the\n\nsubmissions of all the learned Counsel, following questions arise for our\n\nconsideration:-\n\n(A) Whether the judicial officers promoted on ad-hoc basis as\n\nAdditional District and Sessions Judges to man the Fast Track Courts in\n\nthe State and who were substantively appointed to the Cadre of the\n\nDistrict Judge, are entitled to seniority from the date of their initial ad-hoc\n\npromotion?\n\n(B) Whether the selection process initiated in terms of the Notification\n\ndated 31.03.2011 can be said to be in continuation of the process initiated\n\nunder Notification dated 15.04.2010?\n\n(C) Whether the substantive promotion granted to the 47 Judicial\n\nOfficers must be taken to be part of the same selection process pursuant to\n\nthe Notification dated 31.03.2011 and whether the 47 Judicial Officers\n\ncould be placed en-bloc senior to the candidates selected in said selection\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nprocess initiated pursuant to the Notification dated 31.03.2011, without\n\napplying the Cyclic Order in terms of 2010 Rules?\n\n(D) Whether the inter se placement of candidates selected to the Cadre\n\nof District Judge in the State through Limited Competitive Examination,\n\nin the seniority list must be based on their merit in said examination or\n\nshould it be based on their initial seniority in the erstwhile cadre?\n\n(E) Whether the Report dated 15.03.2019 and the consequential Final\n\nSeniority List, otherwise calls for any modification or correction?\n\n39. As regards question No. (A), the law on the point is well settled\n\nand though learned Counsel advanced submissions based on various\n\ndecisions of this Court and the principles emanating therefrom, the\n\nfollowing decisions in the context of ad-hoc appointments as Additional\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judges to man Fast Track Courts in the country, are\n\nsufficient to address the issue.\n\n(A) In\nDebabrata Dash and Another v. Jatindra Prasad Das and\n\nOthers16\n, a Bench of three Judges of this Court considered the case\n\nwherein respondent No.1 was initially appointed as Additional District\n\nJudge (Fast Track Court) on ad-hoc basis and later his service was\n\nregularized in the Senior Branch Cadre in Orrisa Superior Judicial Service.\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nHis claim that service rendered as Judge of the Fast Track Court ought to\n\nbe reckoned for seniority was accepted by the Orissa High Court. This\n\nCourt, however, set aside the decision of the High Court. The question that\n\ncame up for consideration was posed in para 28 as under:-\n\n“28. The crucial question that arises for\nconsideration in this appeal is:\n\nwhether promotion of the writ petitioner as an ad\nhoc Additional District Judge vide Notification dated\n5-1-2002 to the Senior Branch of the Superior Judicial\nService for being posted in the Fast Track Court\nestablished out of the Eleventh Finance Commission\nrecommendations can be said to be an appointment in\nthe Senior Branch Cadre of Superior Judicial Service?\n\nThe fate of the appeal depends upon the answer to\nthis question. If the answer to this question is found in\nthe affirmative, the appeal must fail. On the other\nhand, the appeal must succeed if the answer is in the\nnegative.”\n\nThis Court thereafter considered the effect of 2001 Rules which\n\nwere made to regulate the recruitment of Judicial Officers in the State to\n\nman Fast Track Courts on ad-hoc basis. Para 35 considered the effect of\n\nthe Rules as under:-\n\n“35. As noted earlier, 72 posts of ad hoc Additional\nDistrict Judges were created under the 2001 Rules to\nmeet its objectives. These posts were not part of cadre\nstrength of Senior Branch Service in the 1963 Rules\nnor by creation of these posts under the 2001 Rules,\nthe cadre strength of the Senior Branch of service got\nincreased. The writ petitioner’s promotion as an ad\nhoc Additional District Judge vide Notification dated\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n5-1-2002 pursuant to which he joined the post of ad\nhoc Additional District Judge, Bargarh on 26-4-2002\nis traceable wholly and squarely to the 2001 Rules.\nMerely because the writ petitioner was adjudged\nsuitable on the touchstone of the 1963 Rules, we are\nafraid, it cannot be said that he was given\nappointment to the post of ad hoc Additional District\nJudge under the 1963 Rules. As noted above, there\nwas no vacancy to be filled by promotion in the cadre\nstrength of Senior Branch of the service under the\n1963 Rules on that date.”\n\nThe decisions of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg.\n\nOfficers’ Assn.20 and Rudra Kumar Sain21 as well as in Brij Mohan Lal6\n\nwere also considered as under:-\n\n41. A five-Judge Bench of this Court in Direct\nRecruit Class II Engg. Officers’ Assn. 20 was\nconcerned with a question of seniority in service\nbetween the direct recruits and promotees amongst\nDeputy Engineers in the State of Maharashtra. This\nCourt considered previous decisions of this Court,\nincluding\nS.B. Patwardhan v. State of Maharashtra22\n\nand\nBaleshwar Dass v. State of U.P.23\nand in para 47\nof the Report summed up the legal position. Clauses\n(A), (B) and (C) of para 47 are relevant for the present\npurpose which read as follows: (Direct Recruit Class\nII Engg. Officers’ Assn.20, SCC p. 745, para 47)\n\n“(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a\npost according to rule, his seniority has to be\ncounted from the date of his appointment and\nnot according to the date of his confirmation.\n\nThe corollary of the above rule is that where the\ninitial appointment is only ad hoc and not\naccording to rules and made as a stopgap\n\n20 (1990) 2 SCC 715\n21 (2008) 8 SCC 25\n22 (1977) 3 SCC 399\n23 (1980) 4 SCC 226\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\narrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be\ntaken into account for considering the seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by\nfollowing the procedure\nlaid down by\nthe rules but\nthe appointee continues in the post uninterruptedly\ntill the regularisation of his service in accordance\nwith the rules, the period of officiating service will\nbe counted.\n\n(C) When appointments are made from more\nthan one source, it is permissible to fix the ratio\nfor recruitment from the different sources, and if\nrules are framed in this regard they must ordinarily\nbe followed strictly.”\n\nThe essence of direction in Clause (A) is that the\nseniority of an appointee has to be counted from the\ndate of his appointment and not according to the date\nof his confirmation once a recruitee is appointed to a\npost according to the rules. In other words, where\ninitial appointment is only ad hoc and not according\nto the rules and made as a stopgap arrangement, the\nofficiation in such post cannot be taken into account\nfor considering the seniority. The writ petitioner’s\nappointment as an ad hoc Additional District Judge is\nnot traceable to the 1963 Rules. The simple reason\nleading to this consequence is that there was no\nvacancy available which was to be filled up by\npromotion on that date in the Superior Judicial\nService (Senior Branch).\n\n42. In Rudra Kumar Sain21 a five-Judge Bench of\nthis Court was again concerned with the inter se\nseniority between the promotees and direct recruits in\nthe Delhi Higher Judicial Service. The contention was\nwhether the guidelines and directions given by this\nCourt in O.P. Singla24 have been followed or not. The\nCourt considered the 3 terms “ad hoc”, “stopgap” and\n“fortuitous” in the context of the service jurisprudence\n\n24 (1984) 4 SCC 450\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nand in para 20 of the Report held as under: (Rudra\nKumar Sain case21, SCC p. 45)\n\n“20. In service jurisprudence, a person who\npossesses the requisite qualification for being\nappointed to a particular post and then he is\nappointed with the approval and consultation of\nthe appropriate authority and continues in the post\nfor a fairly long period, then such an appointment\ncannot be held to be ‘stopgap or fortuitous or\npurely ad hoc’. In this view of the matter, the\nreasoning and basis on which the appointment of\nthe promotees in the Delhi Higher Judicial Service\nin the case in hand was held by the High Court to\nbe ‘fortuitous/ad hoc/stopgap’ are wholly\nerroneous and, therefore, exclusion of those\nappointees to have their continuous length of\nservice for seniority is erroneous.”\n\nThe Division Bench in the impugned order 25 has\nquoted the above paragraph from Rudra Kumar\nSain21 but applied it wrongly.\n\n43. In Brij Mohan Lal (1)6 a three-Judge Bench of\nthis Court, inter alia, considered the Fast Track Courts\nScheme. In para 10 of the judgment, this Court gave\nvarious directions. Direction 14 in that paragraph is\nrelevant which can be paraphrased as follows: (SCC\np. 10)\n\n(i) No right will be conferred on judicial\nofficers in service for claiming any regular\npromotion on the basis of his/her appointment\non ad hoc basis under the Scheme.\n\n(ii) The service rendered in the Fast Track\nCourts will be deemed as service rendered in the\nparent cadre.\n\n25 Jatindra Prasad Das v. State of Orissa, WP (C) No.21449 of 2011, decided on\n15-11-2011 (Ori)\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n(iii) In case any judicial officer is promoted\nto higher grade in the parent cadre during his\ntenure in Fast Track Courts, the service rendered\nin Fast Track Courts will be deemed to be\nservice in such higher grade.\n\n44. The learned Senior Counsel for the writ\npetitioner heavily relied upon the third part of\nDirection 14. As a matter of fact, this part has been\nrelied upon in the impugned judgment1 as well. It is\nsubmitted on behalf of the writ petitioner that on\npromotion to the Senior Branch Cadre of Superior\nJudicial Service during his tenure in the Fast Track\nCourts, the writ petitioner is entitled to the counting\nof the service rendered by him in the Fast Track Court\nas a service in Superior Judicial Service (Senior\nBranch). The submission overlooks the first two parts\nof Direction 14, one, no right will be conferred in\njudicial service for claiming any regular promotion on\nthe basis of his/her appointment on ad hoc basis under\nthe scheme; and two, the service rendered in Fast\nTrack Courts will be deemed as service rendered in\nthe parent cadre. In our opinion, until the vacancy\noccurred in the cadre of Superior Judicial Service\n(Senior Branch) which was to be filled up by\npromotion, the service rendered by the writ petitioner\nin the Fast Track Court cannot be deemed to be\nservice rendered in the Superior Judicial Service\n(Senior Branch). Rather until then, he continued to be\na member of the parent cadre i.e. Superior Judicial\nService (Junior Branch). The third part of Direction\n14, in our view, does not deserve to be read in a\nmanner that overrides the 1963 Rules.”\n\n(B) In\nV. Venkata Prasad and Others v. High\nCourt of A.P. and\n\nOthers17, a Bench of two Judges of this Court considered the case which\n\narose in almost identical fact situation. The claim of the concerned\n\nJudicial Officer for reckoning the service rendered as Additional District\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nJudge (Fast Track Courts) on ad-hoc basis was rejected. Reliance was\n\nplaced on the decision of this Court in Debabrata Dash19 and the ratio in\n\nthat decision was followed.\n\n(C) In\nKum C. Yamini v. The State of Andhra Pradesh\n18 a bench of\n\nthree Judges of this Court considered the issue where the candidates from\n\nthe Bar were appointed on ad-hoc basis and after their consideration, claim\n\nwas raised to reckon their seniority from the date of initial ad-hoc\n\nappointment. The relevant observations are :-\n\n“12. While rejecting the claim for their absorption and\nchallenge to the notification issued for the recruitment in\nthe regular cadre posts, certain directions were issued in\n\nBrij Mohan Lal\n(2) (supra) for considering the claims of ad\nhoc judges appointed to Fast Track Courts into regular\ncadre posts. Following the directions only, the second\nrespondent has issued notification inviting applications for\nappointments to the regular cadre of District Judges and\nappellants and others responded to such notification and\ntotally 12 of them were selected for regular vacancies. In\nthe appointment order dated 02.07.2013 in G.O.MS. No.68\nissued by Law (LA & J-SC.F) Department, they were put\non probation for a period of two years and after the\ndeclaration of successful probation and nearly after four\nyears of appointment, the present claim is made claiming\nseniority from the date of their initial appointment, as ad\nhoc District Judges.\n\n13. The claim of the appellants that they were appointed as\nad hoc District Judges by following the procedure which is\nsimilar to the procedure for appointments to the sanctioned\nposts in the regular cadre, is no ground to accede to their\nrequest to reckon their seniority in the permanent cadre of\nDistrict Judges, from their initial appointment as the\nDistrict Judges for the Fast Track Courts. The appointments\nwhich came to be made for selecting District Judges for\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nFast Track Courts sanctioned under the 11th Finance\nScheme are totally different and distinct, compared to\nappointments which are to be made for regular vacant posts\nof District Judges covered under A.P. Higher Judicial\nService. If a person is not appointed to any post in the\ncadre, such person cannot claim any seniority over the\npersons who are appointed in vacant posts in the cadre. The\nFast Track Courts which were sanctioned initially for five\nyears from the grants of 11th Finance Commission, were\ncontinued in some States beyond such period with the\nassistance, from States and such Fast Track Courts were\ndiscontinued in some other States. Merely on the ground\nthat they were selected by following the same procedure\nakin to that of regular selections, is no ground to consider\ntheir claim for grant of seniority from the date of initial\nappointment. When their claim for\nregularisation/absorption and challenge to notification\nissued in the year 2004 for making selections to the vacant\nregular posts of District Judges is rejected by the High\nCourt and confirmed by this Court, we are of the view that\nthe appellants have no basis to claim seniority from the date\nof initial appointment. In any event, having applied in\nresponse to the notification issued by the High Court in the\nyear 2013 after availing the benefit of appointment, it is not\nopen to the appellants to question the conditions imposed in\nthe order which is in conformity with rules. Undisputedly,\nappellant was appointed as ad hoc District Judges to\npreside over the Fast Track Courts only. Initially when she\nwas not appointed to a post or category of posts, forming\npart of cadre strength in such category, appellant cannot\nclaim any seniority over the persons regularly appointed in\nthe category of posts forming part of cadre strength. There\nis yet another ground to reject the claim of the appellant.\nThough the appellant claims seniority over the persons who\nare appointed in regular vacant posts forming part of cadre\nstrength but they are not even made parties. On this ground\nalso, the claim of the appellants deserves rejection.\n\n14. We have perused the judgment relied on by the\nappellant party in person, in the case of\nRudra Kumar Sain\n& Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n(supra). In the aforesaid\ncase, issue relates to claim of seniority between direct\nrecruits and promotees. Learned senior counsel Sri\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nVenkataramani, has also relied on the judgments of this\nCourt in the case of\nBrij Mohan Lal (1) v. Union of India &\nOrs.\n(supra); in the case of\nDebabrata Dash & Anr. v.\nJatindra Prasad Das & Ors.\n(supra); in the case of\nV.\nVenkata Prasad & Ors. v. High\nCourt of\nAndhra Pradesh &\nOrs.\n(supra) and in the case of\nBrij Mohan Lal (2) v. Union\nof India & Ors.\n(supra). We have looked into the judgments\n\nreferred above\nby the learned senior counsel Sri\nVenkataramani and the party in person. Having regard to\nissue involved in the present appeals, we are of the view\nthat the ratio decided in the aforesaid cases would not\nrender any assistance in support of their claim in these\ncases. The claim of seniority will depend upon several\nfactors, nature of appointment, rules as per which the\nappointments are made and when appointments are made,\nwere such appointments to the cadre posts or not etc. When\nthe appellants were not appointed to any regular posts in\nthe A.P. Judicial Service, appellants cannot claim seniority\nbased on their ad hoc appointments to preside over Fast\nTrack Courts. We are of the view that the ratio decided in\nthe said judgments relied on by the appellants would not\nrender any assistance in support of their case.\n\n15. On the other hand, the judgment in the case of\nV.\nVenkata Prasad & Ors. v. High\nCourt of\nAndhra Pradesh &\nOrs.\n(supra), this Court has, in clear terms, while\nconsidering A.P. State Higher Judicial Service Special\nRules for Ad Hoc Appointments, 2001 held that such\nappointments in respect of Fast Track Courts are ad hoc in\nnature and no right accrues to such appointees. The\naforesaid view of this Court clearly supports the case of the\nrespondents. Paragraph 25 of the said case which is\nrelevant for the purpose of these cases reads as under : “25.\nFrom the aforesaid two authorities, it is quite clear that the\nappointments in respect of Fast Track Courts are ad hoc in\nnature and no right is to accrue to such recruits\npromoted/posted on ad hoc basis from the lower judiciary\nfor the regular promotion on the basis of such appointment.\nIt has been categorically stated that FTC Judges were\nappointed under a separate set of rules than the rules\ngoverning the regular appointment in the State Higher\nJudicial Services.”\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nThe decisions in Debabrata Dash16, and V. Venkata Prasad17 were\n\nin the context where serving Judicial Officers were granted ad-hoc\n\npromotions as Fast Track Court Judges, while in C. Yamini18 the members\n\nof the Bar were appointed as Fast Track Court Judges and these decisions\n\nthus completely conclude the issue. As has been held in said decisions, the\n\nreckonable date has to be the date when substantive appointment is made\n\nand not from the date of the initial ad-hoc appointment or promotion.\n\nQuestion (A) is, therefore, answered in the negative.\n\n40. As regards Question No.(B), it is relevant to note that the\n\nNotification dated 15.04.2010 had invited application for filling up 36\n\nvacancies by Direct Recruitments and 22 vacancies by Promotion through\n\nLCE. This was preceded by determination of vacancies through\n\nNotification dated 31.03.2010. After the process initiated in terms of said\n\nNotification dated 15.04.2010 was cancelled, a fresh determination of the\n\nvacancies was undertaken and the Notification dated 31.03.2011 now\n\nfound vacancies for Direct Recruitments, for Promotion through LCE and\n\nfor Regular Promotion at 37, 32 and 24 respectively. Thus, the vacancies\n\nwhich became available post the Notification dated 15.04.2010 were also\n\ntaken into account. The Report dated 15.03.2019 shows that some of the\n\nselected candidates in the process pursuant to the Notification dated\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n31.03.2011 had not even participated in the earlier process of 2010. In the\n\npremises, if the submission that the process initiated under the Notification\n\ndated 31.03.2011 must be held to be in continuation of the earlier selection\n\nof 2010 is accepted, it would amount to conferring undue advantages upon\n\npersons who either had not participated in the process of 2010 or who were\n\nnot even eligible in 2010. The Report dated 15.03.2019, therefore,\n\ncorrectly appreciated the fact situation on record and concluded that it\n\nwould not be in continuation of the earlier process.\n\n41. As regards Question No.(C), it must be noted that as on the date\n\nwhen 2010 Rules came into effect, the Additional District and Sessions\n\nJudges manning the Fast Track Courts had rendered service in ad-hoc\n\ncapacity for almost 07 years. The question whether they be granted\n\npromotion on Regular Basis was subject matter of consideration of the\n\nHigh Court. The Report of the Committee of Judges given in 2008 had\n\nadvised that they be granted Regular Promotion and the matter was getting\n\ndeferred at the level of the Full Court. It was at this stage that 2010 Rules\n\nbecame effective from 18.01.2010. Even thereafter, the Notification dated\n\n31.03.2010 had published the vacancy situation only in respect of Direct\n\nRecruitment and Promotion through LCE. It was obviously so, as the issue\n\nregarding grant of Regular Promotion on substantive basis to those Fast\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nTrack Court Judges was simultaneously under consideration and on\n\n21.04.2010 a formal Order was passed promoting the 47 Judicial Officers\n\non substantive basis to the Cadre of District Judge. The grant of promotion\n\nto the 47 Judicial Officers and selection process pursuant to the\n\nNotification dated 15.04.2010 were not part of the same process and were\n\ncompletely independent. None of the 47 Judicial Officers had the occasion\n\nto compete in the LCE that was undertaken in terms of the Notification\n\ndated 15.04.2010. It is possible to say that the last of the 47 Judicial\n\nOfficers could as well have been the first in the list of successful\n\ncandidates through LCE and thus could possibly have been entitled to\n\nbetter placement. In any case, the process initiated pursuant to the\n\nNotification dated 15.04.2010 was cancelled for administrative reasons and\n\nthe appointments in respect of process pursuant to the Notification dated\n\n31.03.2011 could be effected only in the year 2013, i.e. more than 03 years\n\nafter the 47 Judicial Officers were granted substantive appointment to the\n\nCadre of District Judge. Further, if grant of promotion to the 47 Judicial\n\nOfficers is taken to be the part of the same process, some of the Direct\n\nRecruits may not even be having eligibility in the year 2010 and yet may\n\nbe placed above some of the 47 Judicial Officers. In the circumstances, the\n\nassessment made by the High Court in its Report dated 15.03.2019 is\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nwithout any infirmity and we have no hesitation in concluding that the\n\nsubstantive promotion granted to the 47 Judicial Officers cannot be taken\n\nto be part of the same selection process where Direct Recruits and\n\ncandidates through LCE were appointed to the Cadre of District Judge on\n\n15.07.2013.\n\nIf the substantive appointment of the 47 Judicial Officers to the Cadre\n\nof District Judge is separate and distinct from the selection process through\n\nwhich appointment were made after three years on 15.07.2017, there\n\nwould be no question or occasion to apply the Cyclic Order. It is not the\n\ncontention of anyone that appointment of the 47 Judicial Officers on the\n\nrelevant date was either beyond the quota meant for Regular Promotion or\n\nthat there was any serious infirmity in the process or that any of the\n\ncandidates was completely ineligible. Since there was a difference of more\n\nthan 03 years between these two modes of selection, the Report dated\n\n15.03.2019 rightly concluded that the Cyclic Order ought not to get\n\nattracted.\n\nIt is true that the Cyclic Order and the quota for different streams\n\nensure equitable treatment for three sources. However, the application of\n\nthe Cyclic Order must depend upon the fact situations. It was precisely for\n\nthis reason that the expression “as far as possible” has been used in the\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nRule. Other things being equal, certainly the quotas for different streams\n\nand the Cyclic Order must be adhered to. However, if such adherence itself\n\nis going to cause incongruous situation and inflict incalculable harm,\n\ninsistence upon applicability of the Cyclic Order in such cases may not be\n\nappropriate. The expression “as far as possible” was, therefore, relied\n\nupon by this Court in Para 34 of its decision in Veena Verma12. It would\n\nalso be instructive to refer to a decision of this Court in State of M.P. v.\n\nNarmada Bachao Andolan and Another26, where the expression “as far as\n\npossible” was explained:-\n\n““As far as possible”\n\n38. The aforesaid phrase provides for flexibility,\nclothing the authority concerned with powers to meet\nspecial situations where the normal process of\nresolution cannot flow smoothly. The aforesaid phrase\ncan be interpreted as not being prohibitory in nature.\n\nThe said words rather connote a discretion vested in\nthe prescribed authority. It is thus discretion and not\ncompulsion. There is no hard-and-fast rule in this\nregard as these words give a discretion to the\nauthority concerned. Once the authority exercises its\ndiscretion, the court should not interfere with the said\ndiscretion/decision unless it is found to be palpably\narbitrary. (\nVide Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v.\nMotorola Inc.27\nand High Court of Judicature for\n\nRajasthan v. Veena Verma12\n.) Thus, it is evident that\nthis phrase simply means that the principles are to be\nobserved unless it is not possible to follow the same\nin the particular circumstances of a case.”\n\n26 (2011) 7 SCC 639\n27 (2005) 2 SCC 145\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n41.1. We must at this stage deal with submissions based on the decision\n\nof this Court in N.R. Parmar19. In that case a Bench of two Judges of this\n\nCourt while considering O.N. dated 20.12.1999 and 02.02.2000 had\n\nconcluded as under:-\n\n“31.2. It is not necessary, that the direct recruits\nfor vacancies of a particular recruitment year, should\njoin within the recruitment year (during which the\nvacancies had arisen) itself. As such, the date of\njoining would not be a relevant factor for determining\nseniority of direct recruits. It would suffice if action\nhas been initiated for direct recruit vacancies, within\nthe recruitment year in which the vacancies had\nbecome available. This is so, because delay in\nadministrative action, it was felt, could not deprive an\nindividual of his due seniority. As such, initiation of\naction for recruitment within the recruitment year\nwould be sufficient to assign seniority to the\nappointees concerned in terms of the “rotation of\nquotas” principle, so as to arrange them with other\nappointees (from the alternative source), for vacancies\nof the same recruitment year.\n\n…\n\n34.1. If the process of recruitment has been\ninitiated during the recruitment year (in which the\nvacancies have arisen) itself, even if the examination\nfor the said recruitment is held in a subsequent year,\nand the result is declared in a year later (than the one\nin which the examination was held), and the selected\ncandidates joined in a further later year (than the one\nin which the result was declared), the selected\ncandidates will be entitled to be assigned seniority,\nwith reference to the recruitment year (in which the\nrequisition of vacancies was made). The logic and\nreasoning for the aforesaid conclusion (expressed in\nthe ON dated 2-2-2000) is, if the process of direct\nrecruitment is initiated in the recruitment year itself,\nthe selected candidate(s) cannot be blamed for the\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nadministrative delay, in completing the process of\nselection.”\n\nRelying on the aforementioned observations, it was submitted that\n\nthe candidates selected through Direct Recruitment and LCE on\n\n15.07.2013 could not be prejudiced if the High Court on the administrative\n\nside had segregated the issue of promotion of the 47 Judicial Officers on\n\none hand and the selection through Direct Recruitment and LCE on the\n\nother; and the time lag of three years between the appointments would,\n\ntherefore, be of no consequence.\n\nThe decision in N.R. Parmar19 was thereafter relied upon by\n\nanother Bench of two Judges of this Court in Hon’ble Punjab and\n\nHaryana High Court v. State of Punjab and others28. In that case, the\n\nrecruitment from three different sources to the cadre of District Judge was\n\ndone on three different dates but in the same year. Paragraphs 50 to 53 of\n\nsaid decision may be extracted as under:-\n\n50. At this juncture, one of the submissions, which\nhas been emphatically pressed by the learned Counsel\nfor the promotees is that for determination of\nseniority, continuous length of service is\ndeterminative. The direct recruits and out of turn\npromotees, who were not even born in the cadre when\npromotees were promoted, they have to take seniority\nafter the promotees. In this reference, it is useful to\n\n28 (2019) 12 SCC 496\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nrefer to a judgment of this Court in\nUnion of India and\nOrs. v. N.R. Parmar and Ors.\n(2012) 13 SCC 340, the\nissue in the said case was also an issue of\ndetermination of seniority between direct recruits vis-\nà-vis promotees and quota and rota principles. This\nCourt had occasion to consider the office\nmemorandum issued by the Government dated\n22.12.1959. Noticing Para 6 of above office\nmemorandum following was stated in Para 23 of the\njudgment:\n\n23. The General Principles for determining seniority\nin the Central Services are shown to have been\nlaid\ndown in\nan annexure to an Office Memorandum dated\n22-12-1959 issued by the Government of India,\nMinistry of Home Affairs (hereinafter referred to as\n\"the OM dated 22-12-1959\"). Para 6 of the annexure\n,\n\nreferred to above\n, laid down the manner of\ndetermining inter se seniority between direct recruits\nand promotees. Para 6 is being extracted hereunder:\n\n6. Relative seniority of direct recruits and\npromotees.--The relative seniority of direct\nrecruits and of promotees shall be determined\naccording to the rotation of vacancies between\ndirect recruits and promotees which shall be\nbased on the quotas of vacancies reserved for\ndirect recruitment and promotion respectively in\nthe Department Rules.\n\nIt is apparent from the above extract of the OM\ndated 22-12-1959, that the \"quota\" between\npromotees and direct recruits was to be read into the\nseniority rule. The OM also provided for a definite\nrotation of seniority points (\"rota\") between\npromotees and direct recruits. The rotation provided\nfor was founded on the concept of rotation of quotas\nbetween promo-tees and direct recruits. It is therefore\napparent, that under the OM dated 22-12-1959 inter se\nseniority between the promotees and direct recruits\nwas based on the \"quota\" and \"rota\" principle. The\nsame has been meaningfully described as \"rotation of\nquotas\" in some of these instruments.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n51. There was further office memorandum on\n07.02.1986 to take care of situation where it was\ndecided that in future, while the principle of rotation\nof quotas will still be followed for determining the\ninter-se seniority of direct recruits and promotees, the\npresent practice of keeping vacant slots for being\nfilled up by direct recruits of later years, thereby\ngiving them unintended seniority over promotees who\nwere already in position, would be dispensed with.\nThis Court noticed office memorandum dated\n07.02.1986 and observed that \"when direct recruits or\npromotees become available through later\nexaminations or selections\", it clearly mean that the\nsituation contemplated is one where, there has been an\nearlier examination or selection, and is then followed\nby a \"later\" examination or selection.\n\n52. In the above context, this Court laid down\nfollowing in Paragraph 31.2 that \"it is not necessary,\nthat the direct recruits of a particular recruitment year,\nshould join within the recruitment year itself\". It was\nheld that date of joining would not be a relevant factor\nfor determining seniority of direct recruits. In\nparagraph 31.2 and 34.1 following has been laid\ndown:\n\n31.2. It is not necessary, that the direct recruits for\nvacancies of a particular recruitment year, should\njoin within the recruitment year (during which the\nvacancies had arisen) itself. As such, the date of\njoining would not be a relevant factor for\ndetermining seniority of direct recruits. It would\nsuffice if action has been initiated for direct\nrecruit vacancies, within the recruitment year in\nwhich the vacancies had become available. This\nis so, because delay in administrative action, it\nwas felt, could not deprive an individual of his\ndue seniority. As such, initiation of action for\nrecruitment within the recruitment year would be\nsufficient to assign seniority to the appointees\nconcerned in terms of the \"rotation of quotas\"\n\nprinciple, so as to arrange them with other\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nappointees (from the alternative source), for\nvacancies of the same recruitment year.\n\n34.1. If the process of recruitment has been\ninitiated during the recruitment year (in which the\nvacancies have arisen) itself, even if the\nexamination for the said recruitment is held in a\nsubsequent year, and the result is declared in a\nyear later (than the one in which the examination\nwas held), and the selected candidates joined in a\nfurther later year (than the one in which the result\nwas declared), the selected candidates will be\nentitled to be assigned seniority, with reference to\nthe recruitment year (in which the requisition of\nvacancies was made). The logic and reasoning for\nthe aforesaid conclusion (expressed in the ON\ndated 2-2-2000) is, if the process of direct\nrecruitment is initiated in the recruitment year\nitself, the selected candidate(s) cannot be blamed\nfor the administrative delay, in completing the\nprocess of selection.\n\n53. In the present case, process for all the three\nstreams was completed in the year 2008 and all the\nofficers of three streams had joined in the same year.\nThe submission that quota rota Rule was broken or\nseniority will be affected because of joining of one\ncategory of officers earlier cannot be accepted. It is\nalso relevant to notice that purpose of statutory Rules\nand laying down a procedure for recruitment was to\nachieve the certainty. Officers belonging to different\nstreams have to be confidant that they shall be\nrecruited under their quota and get seniority as per\ntheir quota and roster. In event, the seniority is to be\nfixed with date of joining of particular stream, it will\nlead to uncertainty and making seniority depending on\nadministrative authorities, which is neither in the\ninterest of service nor serve the cause of justice. We,\nthus, conclude that roster is fully applicable for\ndetermination of seniority. Officers of different\nstreams selected in a particular year even though they\nwere allowed to join the post on different dates shall\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nnot affect their inter se seniority, which is to be\ndecided on the basis of roster.”\n\n41.2 It must, however, be stated that the decision in N.K. Parmar19 has\n\nsince then been overruled by a Bench of three Judges of this Court in\nK.\n\nMeghachandra Singh and Ors. vs. Ningam Siro and Others\n29. The\n\nrelevant paragraphs of said decision are as under:\n\n5. Before the Writ Court, the promotees contended\nthat they entered the MPS Grade II Cadre on\n01.03.2007 whereas the private Respondent Nos. 3 to\n33 were appointed subsequently (on 14.08.2007 and\n24.11.2007 respectively) and, therefore, they should\nbe regarded as senior to the direct recruits.\n\n6. The direct recruits on the other hand claimed\nseniority over the promotees by contending that\nseniority has to be decided in accordance with the\nyear of the vacancy and not by the fortuitous date on\nwhich, the appointment could be finalized for the\ndirect recruits.\n\n…\n\n13. It was also made clear that the promotees will\nnaturally have seniority over the Appellants as they\nhad entered the cadre of MPS Grade II, before the\nWrit Appellants were borne in the cadre.\n\n…\n\n17. The Senior Counsel cites\nUnion of India and Ors.\nv. N.R. Parmar\n, (2012)13 SCC 340, to argue that\nwhen action was initiated for filling up the 2005\nvacancies, the administrative delay in finalization of\nthe recruitment leading to delayed appointment\nshould not deprive the individual of his due seniority.\nBy referring to the rotation of quota principle, the\ncounsel argues that initiation of action for recruitment\n\n29 (2019) SCC Online SC 1494\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nin the year of the vacancy would be sufficient, to\nassign seniority from that year.\n\n…\n\n20. Representing the Respondents/promotees, the\nlearned Senior Counsel, Shri Jaideep Gupta refers to\nthe MPS Rules, 1965 to argue that the provisions of\nthe Rules make it abundantly clear that inter-se\nseniority in the cadre of MPS Grade-III is to be\ndetermined by the order in which appointments are\nmade to the service. The counsel pointedly refers to\nRules 28 (i) where it is specified that the .......\nseniority in the service shall be determined by the\norder in which appointments are made to the\nservice....... He also refers to the later part of Rule\n28(iii), where again it is specified that the \"seniority\nof the officer...... shall be counted from the date,\nhe/she is appointed to the service............ . The\nprovisions in Rule 16(iii) are pressed home by Mr.\nGupta to argue that only when the person is\nappointed, he shall be deemed to have been appointed\nto the service from the date of encadrement.\n\n21. The judgment in\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) is read with\nequal emphasis by Mr. Gupta to firstly point out that\nthis case does not lay down the correct law in\ndetermination of seniority. The counsel highlights the\nincongruity in a situation where a person who entered\nservice later will claim seniority above those who\njoined service at an earlier point of time.\n\nThe\napplicability of the ratio in\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) to the\nlitigants in the present case is also questioned by Mr.\nGupta by pointing out that the provisions of MPS\nRules, 1965 applicable for the officers in the Manipur\nPolice Officers, was not the subject of consideration\nin\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra), and, therefore, the said ratio\nrelatable to Income Tax Inspectors, with different\nService Rules, will not apply to the present case.\n\n…\n\n29. Before proceeding to deal with the contention of\nthe Appellants' Counsel vis-à-vis the judgment in\n\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra), it is necessary to observe that\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nthe Law is fairly well settled in a series of cases, that a\nperson is disentitled to claim seniority from a date he\nwas not borne in service. For example, in\nJ.C. Patnaik\n\n(Supra)30 the Court considered the question whether\nthe year in which the vacancy accrues can have any\nbearing for the purpose of determining the seniority\nirrespective of the fact when the person is actually\nrecruited. The Court observed that there could be time\nlag between the year when the vacancy accrues and\nthe year when the final recruitment is made.\n\nReferring\nto the word \"recruited\" occurring in the Orissa Service\nof Engineers Rules, 1941 the Supreme Court held in\n\nJ.C. Patnaik\n(Supra) that person cannot be said to\nhave been recruited to the service only on the basis of\ninitiation of process of recruitment but he is borne in\nthe post only when, formal appointment order is\nissued.\n\n30. The above ratio in\nJ.C. Patnaik\n(Supra) is\nfollowed by this Court in several subsequent cases.\n\nIt\nwould however be appropriate to make specific\nreference considering the seniority dispute in\nreference to the Arunachal Pradesh Rules which are\npari materia to the MPS Rules, 1965, (vide (\n2007) 15\nSCC 406-Nani Sha and Ors. v. State of Arunachal\nPradesh and Ors.\n). Having regard to the similar\nprovisions, the Court approved the view that seniority\nis to be reckoned not from the date when vacancy\narose but from the date on which the appointment is\nmade to the post. The Court particularly held that\nretrospective seniority should not be granted from a\nday when an employee is not even borne in the cadre\nso as to adversely impact those who were validly\nappointed in the meantime.\n\n31. We may also benefit by referring to the Judgment\nin\nState of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. v. Ashok Kumar\nSrivastava and Anr.\n(2014) 14 SCC 720.\n\nThis\njudgment is significant since this is rendered after the\n\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) decision.\n\nHere the Court\napproved the ratio in\nPawan Pratap Singh and Ors. v.\nReevan Singh and Ors.\n(2011) 3 SCC 267, and\n30 (1998) 4 SCC 456\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nconcurred with the view that seniority should not be\nreckoned retrospectively unless it is so expressly\nprovided by the relevant service Rules. The Supreme\nCourt held that seniority cannot be given for an\nemployee who is yet to be borne in the cadre and by\ndoing so it may adversely affect the employees who\nhave been appointed validly in the meantime. The law\nso declared in\nAshok Kumar Srivastava\n(supra) being\nthe one appealing to us, is profitably extracted as\nfollows:\n\n24. The learned Senior Counsel for the Appellants\nhas drawn inspiration from the recent authority in\n\nPawan Pratap Singh v. Reevan Singh\nwhere the\nCourt after referring to earlier authorities in the\nfield has culled out certain principles out of\nwhich the following being the relevant are\nproduced below:\n\n45. (ii) Inter se seniority in a particular service\nhas to be determined as per the service rules.\n\nThe date of entry in a particular service or the\ndate of substantive appointment is the safest\ncriterion for fixing seniority inter se between\none officer or the other or between one group of\nofficers and the other recruited from different\nsources. Any departure therefrom in the\nstatutory rules, executive instructions or\notherwise must be consistent with the\nrequirements of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution.\n\n.....................\n\n45. (iv) The seniority cannot be reckoned from\nthe date of occurrence of the vacancy and cannot\nbe given retrospectively unless it is so expressly\nprovided by the relevant service rules. It is so\nbecause seniority cannot be given on\nretrospective basis when an employee has not\neven been borne in the cadre and by doing so it\nmay adversely affect the employees who have\nbeen appointed validly in the meantime.\n\n…\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\n34. In the above context, it is also necessary to refer to\nthe relevant advertisement issued in 2005 for direct\nrecruitment which allowed the aspirants to apply even\nif, their result in the qualification examination is\nawaited. Even more intriguing and significant is the\nrelaxation that those proposing to appear in the\nqualifying examination are also allowed to respond to\nthe advertisement. If such be the nature of the process\ninitiated (in the year 2005) for making direct\nrecruitment, we can easily visualize a situation where,\nin the event of granting seniority from the stage of\ncommencing the process, a person when eventually\nappointed, would get seniority from a date even\nbefore obtaining the qualification, for holding the\npost.\n\n…\n\n38. When we carefully read the judgment in\nN.R.\nParmar\n(Supra), it appears to us that the referred OMs\n(dated 07.02.1986 and 03.07.1986) were not properly\nconstrued in the judgment. Contrary to the eventual\nfinding, the said two OMs had made it clear that\nseniority of the direct recruits be declared only from\nthe date of appointment and not from the date of\ninitiation of recruitment process. But surprisingly, the\njudgment while referring to the illustration given in\nthe OM in fact overlooks the effect of the said\nillustration.\n\nAccording to us, the illustration extracted\nin the\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) itself, makes it clear that\nthe vacancies which were intended for direct\nrecruitment in a particular year (1986) which were\nfilled in the next year (1987) could be taken into\nconsideration only in the subsequent year's seniority\nlist but not in the seniority list of 1986. In fact, this\nwas indicated in the two OMs dated 07.02.1986 and\n03.07.1986 and that is why the Government issued the\nsubsequent OM on 03.03.2008 by way of clarification\nof the two earlier OMs.\n\n39. At this stage, we must also emphasize that the\nCourt in\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) need not have observed\nthat the selected candidate cannot be blamed for\nadministrative delay and the gap between initiation of\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nprocess and appointment. Such observation is\nfallacious in as much as none can be identified as\nbeing a selected candidate on the date when the\nprocess of recruitment had commenced. On that day, a\nbody of persons aspiring to be appointed to the\nvacancy intended for direct recruits was not in\nexistence. The persons who might respond to an\nadvertisement cannot have any service-related rights,\nnot to talk of right to have their seniority counted\nfrom the date of the advertisement.\nIn other words,\nonly on completion of the process, the Applicant\nmorphs into a selected candidate and, therefore,\nunnecessary observation was made in\nN.R. Parmar\n\n(Supra) to the effect that the selected candidate cannot\nbe blamed for the administrative delay.\n\nIn the same\ncontext, we may usefully refer to the ratio in\n\nShankarsan Dash v. Union of India\n(1991) 3 SCC 47,\nwhere it was held even upon empanelment, an\nappointee does not acquire any right.\n\n40. The Judgment in\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) relating to\nthe Central Government employees cannot in our\nopinion, automatically apply to the Manipur State\nPolice Officers, governed by the MPS Rules, 1965.\n\nWe also feel that\nN.R. Parmar\n(Supra) had incorrectly\ndistinguished the long-standing seniority\ndetermination principles propounded in, inter-alia,\n\nJ.C. Patnaik\n(Supra), Suraj Prakash Gupta and Ors. v.\nState of J&K and Ors. (2000) 7 SCC 561 and Pawan\nPratap Singh and Ors. v. Reevan Singh and Ors.\n(Supra). These three judgments and several others\nwith like enunciation on the law for determination of\nseniority makes it abundantly clear that under Service\nJurisprudence, seniority cannot be claimed from a\ndate when the incumbent is yet to be borne in the\ncadre.\n\nIn our considered opinion, the law on the issue\nis correctly declared in\nJ.C. Patnaik\n(Supra) and\nconsequently we disapprove the norms on assessment\nof inter-se seniority, suggested in\nN.R. Parmar\n\n(Supra). Accordingly, the decision in N.R. Parmar is\noverruled. However, it is made clear that this decision\nwill not affect the inter-se seniority already based on\nN.R. Parmar and the same is protected. This decision\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nwill apply prospectively except where seniority is to\nbe fixed under the relevant Rules from the date of\nvacancy/the date of advertisement.\n\n41. As noted earlier, the Learned Single Judge based\nhis judgment on two propositions but the Division\nBench was of the view that result would be the same\nmerely on the basis of one of the two propositions\nand, therefore, it was unnecessary to pronounce upon\nthe other proposition. Such an approach cannot\ntherefore be described as a conflict (as has been\nsuggested), between the two judgments. Both\nBenches were absolutely consistent in their\nconclusion that promotees would have to be given\nseniority over direct recruits. It cannot therefore be\nargued that by some convoluted reasoning, it is\npossible to come to the conclusion that the orders\npassed by the two Courts would result in\ndiametrically opposite situation namely, that direct\nrecruits would have to be given seniority over\npromotees.”\n\n41.3 The facts noted in paragraph 5 of the decision in Meghachandra\n\nSingh29 show that the promotees entered the relevant grade in March 2007\n\nwhereas the direct recruits were appointed in August and November 2007.\n\nWhile overruling the decision in Parmar19 it was also observed in\n\nparagraph 40 that in Service Jurisprudence, seniority cannot be claimed\n\nwhere the incumbent is yet to be borne in the cadre.\n\n41.4 In the premises, the conclusion is inescapable that the candidates\n\nselected through LCE and Direct Recruitment vide Order dated\n\n15.07.2013 cannot claim to be clubbed with the 47 Judicial Officers\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\npromoted in substantive capacity on 21.04.2010 and cannot claim\n\nappropriate placement in accordance with the Cyclic Order. We\n\naccordingly answer Question (C) and find that the 47 Judicial Officers\n\nwere rightly placed en-bloc senior to all the candidates selected through\n\nthe process initiated pursuant to the Notification dated 31.03.2011.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) Nos.936 of 2018 and 967 are, therefore, dismissed.\n\n42. While considering Question (D), it is relevant to notice the\n\nemphasis placed by this Court in All India Judges Association1 while\n\ndirecting that 25 per cent of the posts in the cadre of the District Judge be\n\nfilled through LCE. It was stated in paragraph 27 that there should be an\n\nincentive amongst relatively junior and other officers to improve and to\n\ncompete with each other so as to excel and get accelerated promotion. In\n\nparagraph 28 the relevant direction again stressed that 25 per cent quota\n\nfor promotion through LCE be “strictly on the basis of merit.”\n\nRule 31(2) of 2010 Rules also uses the expression “strictly on the\n\nbasis of merit” while dealing with posts to be filled in through LCE. The\n\nmerit is to be assessed in terms of the scheme\nlaid down in\nthe relevant\n\nSchedule. After considering various parameters stated in said Schedule,\n\nthe successful candidates are selected on the basis of merit. The list of\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nsuccessful candidates becomes the basis for final selection subject to\n\nqualifying parameters such as suitability, medical fitness etc.\n\nHowever, placing reliance on Rule 47(4), the Committee in its\n\nReport dated 15.03.2019 held that the inter se seniority of persons\n\npromoted to the District Judge Cadre in the same year ought to be the\n\nsame as it was in the posts held by them at the time of promotion.\n\nIf the list is to be drawn up according to merit, it is possible that\n\nthe last person in the list of selectees may be the senior most and going by\n\nthe Report of the Committee, if all the selectees are promoted in the same\n\nyear such last person may as well be at the top of the list of promotees\n\nthrough LCE. In that event, the seniority shall become the governing\n\ncriteria and the excellence on part of a comparatively junior candidate\n\nmay recede in the background. Instead of giving incentive to\n\ncomparatively junior and other officers, the entire examination process\n\nwill stand reduced to a mere qualifying examination rather than a\n\ncompetitive examination affording opportunity to meritorious candidates.\n\nThe criteria shall then become seniority subject to passing the LCE.\n\nThe direction issued in All India Judges Association1 to afford an\n\nincentive to meritorious candidates regardless of their seniority would not\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nthus be carried out. The general principle appearing in Rule 47(4) must,\n\ntherefore, give way to the special dispensation in Rule 31(2) of 2010\n\nRules.\n\nIn our view, the High Court in its Report dated 15.03.2019\n\ncompletely failed to appreciate the true character of LCE and reservation\n\nof certain quota for that category.\n\nWe, therefore, accept the submissions made by the learned\n\nAdvocate for the petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.498 of 2018 and\n\nDiary No.13252 of 2019 and while answering Question (D) declare that\n\nthe inter se placement of the candidates selected through LCE must be\n\nbased on merit and not on the basis of the seniority in the erstwhile cadre.\n\nSaid Writ Petitions are allowed to that extent.\n\n43. We now deal with the submissions advanced in Writ Petition\n\n(Civil) Nos.464 of 2019 and 899 of 2019 and other similar matters.\n\nIt is true that as on the date when 2010 Rules came into effect,\n\nthere were 83 Fast Track Courts functioning in the State and appropriate\n\nmention to that effect was made in Part A of Schedule II to 2010 Rules. It\n\nis also correct to say that the ad-hoc promotions granted to the concerned\n\nJudicial Officers were under 1969 Rules. But such promotions were on\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nad-hoc basis to man the Fast Track Courts and the law on the point is now\n\nwell settled that the service rendered by such Judicial Officers as Fast\n\nTrack Court Judges on ad-hoc basis cannot be taken into account while\n\nreckoning seniority after such Judicial Officers were granted promotion\n\non substantive basis and that their seniority has to be reckoned only from\n\nthe date of their substantive appointment to the cadre of District Judge.\n\nSaid 1969 Rules do not in any way confer any right which would be\n\ninconsistent with the law so\nlaid down by\nthis Court.\n\nThe further submission that four Judicial Officers out of the 47\n\nJudicial Officers were also appointed on the same day along with the\n\npetitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.464 of 2019 also has no merit. The\n\ngrant of promotion on substantive basis to said four Judicial Officers does\n\nnot by itself entitle said petitioners to any similar treatment. The issue of\n\ngrant of promotion on substantive basis may depend upon various issues\n\nincluding suitability of the concerned candidate and availability of posts.\n\nThe record also shows that after grant of promotion on substantive basis\n\nto the 47 Judicial Officers, there were no vacancies for Regular Promotion\n\nwhich is why the selection process undertaken in the year 2010 did not\n\nearmark any vacancies for Regular Promotions and it was only in the year\n\n2011, when adequate vacancies for said category became available, that\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nthe Notification dated 31.03.2011 contemplated filling up of certain\n\nvacancies by Regulation Promotion.\n\nThe petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.464 of 2019\n\nparticipated in the process initiated pursuant to said Notification dated\n\n31.03.2011. Some of them also appeared in LCE and availed of the\n\nopportunity to stake their claim. Their regular promotions to the Cadre of\n\nDistrict Judge must, therefore, be taken only as a result of selection\n\nprocess initiated in terms of the Notification dated 31.03.2011 which\n\nculminated in the Order dated 15.07.2013. In the circumstances, their\n\nsubstantive appointment to said cadre has to be reckoned from 15.07.2013\n\nand not with any anterior effect.\n\nOnce the Regular Promotion was part of the same process along\n\nwith other streams, namely, through Direct Recruitment and LCE, the\n\nCyclic Order had to be applied and said petitioners cannot be given en-\n\nbloc placement above the candidates selected through Direct Recruitment\n\nand LCE in the same process of selection.\n\nWe, therefore, see no merit in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 464 of\n\n2019 and said Writ Petition is dismissed.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nThe petitioners in Writ Petition (Civil) No.899 of 2019 and other\n\nconnected matters came to be appointed on ad-hoc basis to man the Fast\n\nTrack Courts after 2010 Rules came into effect. Even if their services\n\nwere continued after abolition of Fast Track Courts, that by itself would\n\nnot confer any right on them. They came to be substantively promoted to\n\nthe Cadre of District Judge only vide Order dated 05.02.2016. For the\n\nreasons stated hereinabove, their entitlement on substantive basis has to be\n\nreckoned only from 05.02.2016 and not from any earlier date. Writ\n\nPetition (Civil) No.899 of 2019 and other connected matters are,\n\ntherefore, dismissed. Thus, while answering Question (E), we conclude\n\nthat the Report dated 15.03.2019 does not call for any modification,\n\nexcept to the extent dealt with in answer to Question (D).\n\n44. Concluding thus, we direct:-\n\n(a) Writ Petition (Civil) No.498 of 2018 and Writ Petition (Civil)\n\n_______ of 2020 [D. No.13252 of 2019] are allowed to the extent\n\nindicated above.\n\n(b) Consequently, the seniority list issued in terms of Report dated\n\n15.03.2019 shall stand modified only to the extent that appropriate\n\nplacement to the candidates selected through LCE be given on the\nWrit Petition (Civil) No.936 of 2018 etc etc.\n\nDinesh Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Hon. High\nCourt for Judicature of Rajasthan and\nAnr.\nbasis of their merit in the examination and not on the basis of their\n\nseniority in the erstwhile cadre. Let the appropriate changes be\n\nmade within four weeks of this Judgment.\n\n(c) Except to the extent indicated in direction (b) above, the\n\nReport dated 15.03.2019 does not call for any modification or\n\nclarification.\n\n(d) All other writ petitions are dismissed.\n\n……………………….J.\n[Uday Umesh Lalit]\n\n……………………….J.\n[Vineet Saran]\nNew Delhi;\n\nApril 29, 2020.",
