The Brief Facts:\n\n 2. The case of the prosecution is that between 2013 and 2016, all the\n\n accused conspired to cheat the Indian Overseas Bank. They applied for and\n\n received a Rs.30 Crores term loan by making false representations to the\n\n Bank, leading it to believe that the 1st accused, M/s Truedome EPC India Pvt.\n\n Ltd., was engaged in genuine wind energy projects. As a result, the loan was\n\n approved on 28.03.2013, and the amount was disbursed on 30.03.2013 into\n\n the loan account No. 0060 0327 1300 007 of the 1st accused company.\n\n 2.1. On the same day, the 4th accused, representing the 1st accused,\n\n submitted a letter to the Chief Manager of Indian Overseas Bank, requesting\n\n 4/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n the transfer of funds to three different firms: M/s Ecodome Power Pvt. Ltd.,\n\n M/s Mark Green Developers Pvt. Ltd., and M/s Sri Balaji Traders, amounting\n\n to Rs.13.5 Crores, Rs.12.5 Crores, and Rs.4 Crores respectively. Accordingly,\n\n the funds were transferred to these entities. The Director of M/s Ecodome\n\n Power Pvt. Ltd. is the 4th accused, and another Director, Mr. Arun Nehru, is\n\n the elder brother's son of the 6th accused, N. Ravichandran, who is the\n\n Managing Director of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. The company M/s\n\n Ecodome Power Pvt. Ltd. did not conduct any business or utilize the funds in\n\n relation to the wind turbine generator project with M/s Trishe Renewable\n\n Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd. However, the entire amount was transferred to the\n\n account of the 7th accused, M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd.\n\n 2.2. Similarly, M/s Mark Green Developers Pvt. Ltd., in whose favour\n\n Rs.12.5 Crores was transferred, did not have any proper business and\n\n transferred this amount to the account of the 7th accused - M/s True Value\n\n Homes Pvt. Ltd. M/s Sri Balaji Traders also transferred Rs.2 Crores into the\n\n accounts of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. and another Rs.2 Crores to M/s\n\n TVH Energy Resources Pvt. Ltd. The majority of the funds pooled into the\n\n account of M/s True Value Homes Pvt. Ltd. was used on the same day, i.e.,\n\n 5/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n 30.03.2013, to settle its term loan with M/s Punjab National Bank.\n\n Additionally, Rs.28.08 Crores, out of the loan amount sanctioned by Indian\n\n Overseas Bank, was used for this purpose.\n\n 2.3. Thereafter, even though the original sanction terms were amended\n\n and the initial holiday period of one year was extended to two years, in 2016,\n\n the loan account became a Non-Performing Asset. Subsequently, by a\n\n communication dated 18.11.2019, the 1st accused – Company was required to\n\n pay Rs. 31.5 Crores as a one-time settlement. The settlement amount was to be\n\n paid in two installments: Rs. 21.50 Crores on or before 15.12.2019 and Rs. 10\n\n Crores on or before 15.01.2020. The One Time Settlement sanction letter was\n\n issued on 29.11.2019. The 1st accused did not adhere to this, and\n\n consequently, after receiving another request letter from the 2nd accused – T.\n\n Elayaraja, the bank issued a revised OTS proposal for a full and final\n\n settlement of Rs. 33.42 Crores, including the delayed period interest of Rs.\n\n 1.91 Crores, to be paid on or before 30.09.2021. After obtaining an extension,\n\n a sum of Rs. 8.34 Crores of the OTS amount was paid on time, but the\n\n remaining amounts were not paid within the stipulated period.\n\n 6/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n 2.4. At this juncture, a complaint was forwarded by the Bank on\n\n 24.12.2021, based on which a case was registered in R.C.No.032/2021 A 0022\n\n for alleged offences under Section 420, and 120B read with \nSection 420\n of\n\n IPC. During the investigation of the complaint, the Indian Overseas Bank\n\n agreed to accept a further delayed period interest of Rs.2,67,68,876.75/- over\n\n and above the amount already due, and the 1st accused paid the sum of\n\n Rs.25.08 Crores on 11.05.2022. Thereafter, the Indian Overseas Bank\n\n calculated an additional Rs.37 Lakhs as belated payment interest, which was\n\n paid and accepted as full and final settlement on 23.02.2023, and a no-\n\n objection certificate was issued by the Bank stating that the loan account was\n\n entirely cleared. It is at this stage, on 22.08.2024, that the present final report\n\n was laid and taken on file as C.C.N.2358 of 2024 before the Additional Chief\n\n Metropolitan Magistrate, Chennai, and summons were issued to the accused.\n\n All the accused except the accused No. 5 are before this Court.\n\n C.The Submissions:\n\n 3. Heard M r . V i j a y a Na r a y a n , Mr.Sankaran ar ay an an, and M r . O m\n\n Pr ak a s h , the learned Senior Counsel, who argued the matter in detail. Since\n\n their arguments overlap, they are summarized point wise.\n\n 7/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n 3.1. First, they would submit that on a perusal of the transactions and\n\n even as per the final report, except \nSection 120-B\n IPC for which no specific\n\n material was placed on record, the only other offence being under \nSection 420\n\n of IPC, is compoundable in nature. The alleged transactions does not make out\n\n an offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC, in as much as for a term loan of Rs.30\n\n Crores, a property ad-measuring 53,540 sq.ft in Old No.15 & 16, New Door\n\n No.55 at Dr.Muthulakshmi Salai, also known as Lattice Bridge Road, Adyar,\n\n Chennai – 600 020 was given as security by the guarantor, viz., M/s Vicoans\n\n Infrastructure and Environment Engineering Pvt. Ltd., which is the owner of\n\n the property and the accepted valuation report of the valuers approved by the\n\n bankers, estimated the fair market value of the property as Rs.128.30 Crores,\n\n even as on 23.03.2013. A mortgage deed was duly executed. Therefore, in this\n\n case, it can never be argued by the prosecution that there was an intention to\n\n cheat the bank, at the inception. Like every other default loan account, after\n\n the loan was serviced for some time, thereupon, it became a Non Performing\n\n Asset and the proceedings were pending before the Debt Recovery Tribunal.\n\n 8/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n 3.2. In the year 2019, an OTS proposal has been granted and had the\n\n Company paid the OTS within the first deadline itself, even the compliant\n\n would not have emanated from the Bank. Even after extension of time, the 1 st\n\n accused – Company was able to make only a part payment, the complaint\n\n emanated from the Bank. But once the Bank extended the time and the entire\n\n OTS amount was settled amicably, which included the belated payment of\n\n interest, absolutely no offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC ever made out and\n\n therefore, the transactions firstly are completely civil in nature. Criminal\n\n colour was sought to be given by mentioning the purpose for which the loan\n\n was sought and the purpose of which the loan was used. Even then, it is the\n\n contention of the learned Senior Counsel that the loan itself was granted under\n\n the insta fund scheme, which is based more on the security rather than the\n\n purpose of business.\n\n 3.3. The learned Senior Counsel would submit that the further\n\n investigation does not reveal that the Company had never entered into any\n\n agreement with the concerned entities, nor does it suggest that the Company\n\n was not engaged in the business of wind energy. The only allegation, which\n\n 9/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n has been raised belatedly, appears to be that the part payment under the One-\n\n Time Settlement (OTS) was not made, and that the funds were allegedly\n\n diverted to the group concern, namely, the 7 accused. Thus, the action, though\n th\n\n potentially questionable as 'fraud' within the meaning of the circular issued by\n\n the Reserve Bank of India for the purpose of classifying the account as\n\n fraudulent, does not, by itself, constitute a criminal offence, as fraud under\n\n such circulars is not synonymous with cheating as defined under criminal law.\n\n Thus, either at the inception of the transaction or when the transactions\n\n concluded by a memorandum of understanding by way of OTS finally, by\n\n paying the interest on belated payment, no offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC\n\n was made out and therefore, the complaint is liable to be quashed.\n\n 3.4. The learned Senior Counsel would further submit that when the\n\n bank has received the amount towards full and final settlement and the matter\n\n amicably settled between the parties and the bank is not claiming any further\n\n amount due, by the dicta of the Judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\n India in this regard, this Court should exercise the power under \nSection 482\n of\n\n the Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the case, as the proceedings are\n\n predominantly civil in nature, and considering the commercial wisdom, the\n\n bank has settled the transactions and it would be oppressive on the accused to\n\n 10/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n continue the prosecution. In any event, when the cause of action itself has\n\n arisen on account of the part non-payment of the OTS amount, the same\n\n subsequently being paid and the bank accepting the same as full quit by\n\n adding another Rs.37 Lakhs as belated payment interest, the possibility of\n\n further prosecution is very bleak, and therefore, on that score also, the case is\n\n liable to be quashed.\n\n 3.5. \nIn support of their submissions for the proposition that the\n\n classification of the fraudulent account is violative of principles of natural\n\n justice, and the consequential FIR should be quashed, the Judgment of the\n\n Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in \nState Bank of India and Others Vs.\n\n Rajesh Agarwal and Others1\n, is relied upon. To contend that the ingredients\n\n of \nSection 420\n of IPC are not made out in the instant case, the following four\n\n Judgments are relied upon:\n\n Sl. Citation Case Name\n No.\n 1. (2021) 18 SCC 70 N.Radhavender Vs. State of Andhra Pradesh,\n CBI\n 2. (2024) SCCOnLine SC 339 A.M.Mohan Vs. State represented by SHO &\n Anr.\n 3. \n(\n2024) SCCOnLine SC 726 Sharif Ahmed & Anr. Vs.

Nilesh Ramdas Tal & Anr.\n\n 1 (2023) 6 SCC 1\n\n 11/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n Sl. Citation Case Name\n No.\n\n 929\n\n 3.6. For the proposition that in view of the amicable settlement of the\n\n loan amount, this Court should exercise the power under \nSection 482\n of the\n\n Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the proceedings, the following\n\n Judgments were relied upon:\n\n Sl. Citation Case Name\n No.\n 1. \n(\n2014) 5 SCC 364 CBI Vs. Narendra Lal Jain & Ors\n.\n\n \n2. (\n2024) SCCOnLine SC 2696 Tarina Sen Vs. Union of India & Anr\n.\n\n \n3. (\n2024) SCCOnLine Del Lalit Kishore & Ors. Vs. CBI & Anr\n.\n\n 5792\n\n 4. (2025) SCCOnLine SC 788 Suresh V. Singal & Ors Vs. State of Gujarat &\n Ors.\n\n \n5. (\n2025) SCCOnLine SC 1257 N.S.Gnaneshwaran Vs. Inspector of Police &\n Anr\n.\n\n 3.7. Per contr a, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on\n\n behalf of the 1 respondent - CBI would submit that the proposition that once\n st\n\n the loan amount is subsequently settled, this Court should quash the case is\n\n incorrect in law. Even though in some individual cases the proceedings are\n\n quashed, the law \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Gian\n\n 12/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n Singh's case (cited supra) and in other Judgments have been followed till\n\n date. Therefore, if the transactions are such amounting to grave fraud,\n\n especially in financial matters, when the loan amount is as large as Rs.30\n\n Crores in the instant case, the Court should not interfere with the matter.\n\n 3.8. In the instant case, the facts are alarming. After representing to the\n\n bank that they are going to conduct a business relating to wind energy, on the\n\n same day, within hours, the entire loan amount has been siphoned off to other\n\n shell entities and ultimately transferred to the 7 accused, for the purpose of\n th\n\n repayment of loan to another bank. The said conduct has to be taken into\n\n account by this Court. Further, the loan was not repaid, thus the account\n\n became NPA. When a false representation is made, inducing the bank to part\n\n away with a loan amount of Rs.30 Crores and subsequently when the accused\n\n did not repay the same and cheated, the offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC was\n\n made out, and merely because subsequently the amount has been repaid will\n\n not undo the offence and considering the nature of transactions, this is not a fit\n\n case for interference by this Court.\n\n 3.9. In this case, on a perusal of the memorandum of understanding\n\n entered into at the time of OTS, it can be seen that the bank has specifically\n\n 13/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n stated that the existing criminal cases will continue and therefore, there is no\n\n question of quashing this case on compromise. In support of his submissions,\n\n the learned Special Public Prosecutor would rely upon the following\n\n Judgments:\n\n Sl. Citation Case Name\n No.\n 1. \n(\n2013) 10 SCC 686 Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Jagjit Singh\n\n 2.\n \n(2014) 15 SCC 29 State of Maharashtra through \nCBI Vs. Vikram\n Anantrai Doshi & Ors.\n\n 3.\n \n(\n2016) 1 SCC 389 Central Bureau of Investigation Vs. Maninder\n Singh\n\n 4.\n (2016) 1 SCC 376 State of Tamil Nadu Vs. R.Vasanthi Stanley &\n Anr.\n\n 5. (2023) SCC OnLine Mad Eventus Integrated Management Pvt. Ltd. Vs.\n 2712 State, Inspector of Police and Another\n\n 6. Crl.O.P.No.16754 of 2024 M/s Springfield Shelters Pvt. Ltd. And Ors. Vs.\n Deputy Superintendent of Police and Ors.\n\n \n3.10. The learned Special Public Prosecutor would also rely upon the\n\n Judgment in \nKothari Polymers Limited and Others Vs. CBI2\n to contend that\n\n even if the case is to be quashed, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had\n\n imposed appropriate costs, so as to cover the possible expenses.\n\n 3.11. M s . V . R a j e s w a r i , the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 2nd\n\n respondent – Bank, at the outset would submit that it is true that pursuant to\n\n 2 (2022) SCC Online SC 2078\n\n 14/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n the OTS the entire amount was settled and that no further amount is claimed\n\n by the Bank. However, while entering into the OTS amount, since the bank\n\n had to forego a portion of the notional amount due, even though the Bank had\n\n realised the book amount due and the belated payment interest, the Bank had\n\n not expressly undertaken to withdraw the criminal complaint, and therefore,\n\n though there is a settlement of the account with reference to the loan\n\n transaction, there is no express clause for compromise regarding the criminal\n\n case. The Bank thus takes a position to that extent.\n\n 3.12. Mr.N.Ramesh, the learned Special Public Prosecutor appearing on\n\n behalf of the Enforcement Directorate would submit that the Enforcement\n\n Directorate has also registered an ECIR under the \nMoney Laundering Act,\n\n 2002\n, based on the present predicate offences and would take the same stand\n\n as the CBI.\n\n 4. I have considered the rival submissions made on either side and\n\n perused the material records of the case.\n\n D.The Questions:\n\n 5. The following questions arise for consideration in the instant case:-\n\n 15/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n (i) Whether the final report filed in C.C.No.2358 of 2024 is liable to be\n\n quashed as no offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC is ever made out ?\n\n (ii) Whether the final report in C.C.No.2358 of 2024 is liable to be\n\n quashed on account of the fact that subsequently the entire loan amount was\n\n settled through OTS scheme with the Bank ?\n\n E.Question No.(i):\n\n 6. On a plain reading of \nSection 420\n of IPC and the Judgments that are\n\n relied upon, which are cited supra on the propositions it would be clear that,\n\n (a) the primary ingredient is that there must be a deception of a person.\n\n (b) The person should have been fraudulently or dishonestly induced to\n\n deliver any property belonging to him.\n\n (c) The same should have been done with an intention to cheat that a\n\n person, at the time of inducement itself.\n\n 6.1. In this case, the letter dated 11.03.2013 of the 1 st accused is stated\n\n to be the application for sanction of the loan of Rs.30 Crores. It is a three-page\n\n communication. It first details about the 1st accused – Company and its\n\n Directors. Thereafter, it details about the business that it is engaged in,\n\n 16/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n windmill, turbines and towers. Further, it details about the project executed by\n\n the company with an organization, viz., M/s. Liatenat Sriram. It further states\n\n that they have availed credit facilities from Indian Bank for the 49.50 MW\n\n project being a overdraft facility of Rs.26.80 Crores, by offering collateral\n\n security with a market value of Rs.44.73 Crores. Though, the project is\n\n completed by making investments and the other approvals were also in place,\n\n there was a problem with reference to the grid connectivity by the Tamil Nadu\n\n Electricity Board, as otherwise, they would have earned a profit of more than\n\n Rs.30 Crores. But the profit is restricted to only Rs.1.15 Crores in the said\n\n project. They have also completed another 30 MW project.\n\n 6.2. It is further stated that they have now bagged two more contracts\n\n worth about Rs.60.48 Crores from M/s Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions\n\n Pvt.

Thus, their\n\n business prospects look very bright and therefore they need funds to augment\n\n their working capital position. Stating so, they sought the present limit for\n\n execution of the two fresh contracts, promising that all transactions will be\n\n routed through the current account maintained with the Indian Overseas Bank\n\n 17/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n and an immovable property security at Nallambakkam village was also\n\n initially offered. It is essential to extract the relevant portion of the said\n\n application which reads thus:-\n\n “The Company had already completed 30 MW of setting\n up of windmills for Shriram Lietner and Regen Power tech and\n has hands on experience on the field. The profits earned on these\n contracts were retained in the business and are used to service the\n existing loan and a part of the profit was utilized for executing the\n 49.50 MW of Shriram Lietner contract. The promoters have\n bagged a further two contracts worth Rs.60.48 Crores from M/s\n Trishe Renewable Energy Solutions Private Limited for setting up\n 100.80 MW comprising of 48 nos. at Moolanoor, Tirupur\n District.\n\n The promoters have already infused Rs.13.67 Crores to\n execute the works and for servicing the facility with Indian Bank.\n As explained they have bagged the referred two contracts, which\n shall infuse some cashflow to the system. Further the present\n limit is sought for execution of the two fresh contracts. In the past\n for executing the 30 MW contracts (2 nos), all the transactions\n were routed through the current account maintained with Indian\n Overseas Bank, which goes to speak about our efficiency of\n executing the contract.\n\n As our growth in business and prospects look very bright,\n we need to go in for bank support to augment our working capital\n position.\n\n We enclose our Balance sheet as also financial\n projections.

But the entire amount was transferred to\n\n their three group Concerns, within hours, who in-turn again, transferred\n\n almost the entire amount, to 7th accused, for the purpose of repaying the loan.\n\n From the materials, it is clear that a false representation was made to the Bank,\n\n with reference to the purpose for which the funds will be used. Therefore,\n\n there is a deception.\n\n 6.4. It can be contended on behalf of the Bank that only on the\n\n representation that the 1st accused will utilise the funds for its own purposes,\n\n the loan amount was parted. It is true that a security of almost four times of\n\n the loan amount was given and a mortgage deed was also executed. But at the\n\n same time, it has to be seen that after making a representation and taking away\n\n the money, the loan amount was not repaid in time. The Bank took action\n\n under the \nSecuritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\n\n Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002\n (\"\nSARFAESI Act\n\") to auction the\n\n secured asset, but it is stated before this Court that in spite of five attempts, the\n\n property could not be sold, as there were no bidders. It is stated that on\n\n account of the same, an OTS settlement was entered into considering the\n\n commercial prudence.

Even after the second extension of time, only the\n\n part-payment of Rs.8.34 Crores was made and the major amount remained\n\n unpaid and once the deception was made and the amounts were parted and the\n\n same was not paid and the security not being sold; the OTS amount has not\n\n been realized; on the day of forwarding the complaint, the Bank was at a loss.\n\n Therefore, the offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC was prima facie made out.\n\n 6.5. The contention on behalf of the accused that there was no other\n\n impediment to the sale of the secured asset, and regarding the circumstances\n\n under which the mortgaged property was not sold, and whether the Bank had\n\n actually reduced the upset price of the property in accordance with the rules if\n\n there were no bidders, are to be further examined. It is also submitted that\n\n there was a dispute regarding the portion of the property. On the face of it, the\n\n offence under \nSection 420\n of IPC is made out, and to contend that no offence\n\n is made out would require an exercise of appreciating and further evaluating\n\n the evidence that would come on record, including the defence version;\n\n therefore, this question is answered in favour of the prosecution and against\n\n the petitioners.

Thus, from the detailed analysis of numerous decisions, it is evident\n\n 32/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n that the law regarding the quashing of criminal cases involving non-\n\n \ncompoundable offences, where parties allege settlement, has been clearly laid\n\n down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in \nGian Singh\n's case (cited\n\n supra). It is essential to refer to paragraph Nos. 58 and 61 of that judgment:\n\n “58. Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding\n having regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender\n and the victim has been settled although the offences are not\n compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of\n criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in\n the case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an\n end and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the\n ultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have\n harmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that\n seriously endangers and threatens the well-being of the society\n and it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the\n victim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has\n been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made\n compoundable in law, with or without the permission of the\n court. In respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\n etc., or other offences of mental depravity under \nIPC\n or offences\n of moral turpitude under special statutes, like the \nPrevention of\n Corruption Act\n or the offences committed by public servants\n while working in that capacity, the settlement between the\n offender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all.\n However, certain offences which overwhelmingly and\n predominantly bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,\n mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or such like\n transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony, particularly\n relating to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is\n basically to the victim and the offender and the victim have\n settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the\n fact that such offences have not been made compoundable, the\n High Court may within the framework of its inherent power,\n quash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it\n is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any\n likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing\n the criminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of\n justice shall be defeated. The above list is illustrative and not\n exhaustive. Each case will depend on its own facts and no hard-\n\n 33/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n and-fast category can be prescribed.\n\n ......\n\n ......\n\n 61. The position that emerges from the above discussion\n can be summarised thus : the power of the High Court in\n quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise\n of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\n given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under\n Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude\n with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\n with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the\n ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\n court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\n complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the\n victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and\n circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.\n\n However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must\n have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous\n and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\n rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the\n victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the\n dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a\n serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between\n the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under\n special statutes like the \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the\n offences committed by public servants while working in that\n capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal\n proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases\n having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand\n on a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly\n the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,\n partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where\n the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties\n have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the\n High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view,\n because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\n the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation\n of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression\n and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by\n not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete\n settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the\n High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary\n to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding\n\n 34/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n or continuation of the criminal proceeding would tantamount to\n abuse of process of law despite settlement and compromise\n between the victim and the wrongdoer and whether to secure the\n ends of justice, it is appropriate that the criminal case is put to an\n end and if the answer to the above question(s) is in the\n affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\n quash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n 7.3. There is no quarrel over the proposition that the High Court will be\n\n well within its jurisdiction to quash the proceedings on compromise, if the\n\n offence is predominantly civil in nature, private in nature, completely settled\n\n between the parties with no claim subsisting and the continuance of the\n\n proceedings is a bleak prospect for the prosecution and would be oppressive\n\n on the accused to be continued, even after settlement. The power is to be\n\n exercised with a great amount of prudence and responsibility, to secure the\n\n ends of justice.\n\n 7.4. However, the question regarding the instances of various frauds\n\n committed by parties concerning banking transactions, obtaining loans, and\n\n defaulting on and subsequently settling them through methods like OTS, with\n\n the bank, has been addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the\n\n cases mentioned above. In some cases, cases were quashed, while in others,\n\n they were not. But a proper and combined reading of all the judgments cited\n\n above related to this subject shows that the common thread for the conclusion\n\n 35/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n reached. It is not the classification or categorisation of the particular offence,\n\n such as 468, 471 of \nIPC\n, or offences under Section 120 B read with 420 of\n\n \nIPC\n which is paramount. Instead, it is the nature of the allegations that the\n\n Court must examine. By considering the facts and circumstances of each case,\n\n one has to determine whether the case involves a purely commercial or private\n\n transaction between the bank and the borrower, or if it has broader\n\n implications affecting society or the financial system as a whole.\n\n 7.5. In these cases, the nature of facts and circumstances must be\n\n examined. First, the Court must be satisfied that the case is primarily\n\n commercial or civil in nature and that the criminal aspects are not of utmost\n\n depravity and seriousness, which could have a likely impact on society as a\n\n whole or the country's financial system. The second step involves assessing\n\n whether the case has been fully settled and whether the Bank has any\n\n remaining claims. If the case has reached a complete and final settlement and\n\n the bank has no pending claims, then the Court moves to the third step to\n\n evaluate whether continuing the prosecution is prudent and likely to succeed\n\n in prosecuting the accused. Additionally, the Court must consider whether\n\n continuing the proceedings would be unfair, oppressive, or constitute an abuse\n\n 36/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n of the legal process, considering the nature of the settlement or compromise,\n\n the circumstances of the alleged default, efforts made by the accused, the time\n\n elapsed, and the stage at which quashing is requested. In the interest of justice,\n\n the Court may, in fit cases, decide to quash the proceedings. In appropriate\n\n cases, costs can also be imposed.\n\n G.The consideration and findings:\n\n 8. Now, addressing the facts of this case, the following are relevant for\n\n consideration:\n\n (i) The loan amount was Rs. 30 Crores, which was quite a high amount\n\n in 2013 when the borrowing took place.\n\n (ii) Before the default in payment, the primary wrongful act of the\n\n accused was that when they needed funds to immediately repay a loan taken\n\n by the seventh accused company from Punjab National Bank, they dishonestly\n\n obtained a loan in the name of the first accused company, falsely claiming it\n\n was for working capital. They used the money to repay the loan on the same\n\n day, routing it through three entities controlled by them, which had no actual\n\n business.\n\n (iii) The loan was granted without adhering to certain norms. After\n\n disbursal, no inspection was carried out to verify the purpose for which the\n\n 37/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n funds were used, even though the bank officials transferred the funds in three\n\n tranches within hours of disbursement, leading to the loan being repaid to\n\n another bank. Following a default, an original application was filed for\n\n recovery of the amount due, and SARFAESI action was initiated. Although\n\n the secured asset is a property in a prime location in Chennai, it is stated that\n\n there were no bidders five times due to a dispute over a minor part of the\n\n property. It is unclear if the upset price was lowered for subsequent auctions.\n\n When a one-time settlement was offered despite the default, the bank did not\n\n treat the offer as withdrawn, unlike in other cases, but granted two extensions\n\n after payment of revised amounts. Despite the valuable security, a One-Time\n\n Settlement (OTS) was approved due to an expected delay of about a year in\n\n recovering the amount through auction. From the collected materials, it\n\n appears that Regional Office officials (LW-2 & 3) blame the Branch Managers\n\n for norm violations during the loan approval, while the Branch Official (LW-\n\n 21) claims that the Regional Office handled the entire process because of the\n\n high value of the application.\n\n (iv) There is no evidence that the petitioners conspired with or paid any\n\n quid pro quo to any of the bank's officials, and the bank did not file any\n\n complaint against its officers. Nor did the CBI uncover any evidence against\n\n 38/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n public servants; only the companies and their directors are prosecuted for\n\n offences under Section 120(B) read with 420 and 420 of \nIPC\n, with the only\n\n non-compoundable offence being 120(B)of \nIPC\n.\n\n (v) The matter was amicably resolved between the parties through the\n\n memorandum of settlement, and the relevant portions read as follows:\n\n “9. A n y Suit/ C l a i m/ C o m p l a i n t filed by the\n B o r r o w e r s/ G u a r a n t o r s again st the Ba n k sho ul d be withd r a w n\n befo r e rele a s e of the secu r iti e s.\n\n 10.

This settle m e n t will not affect our Ba n k ’ s right and\n oblig a ti o n to shar e any infor m a t i o n in the cou r s e of any crim i n a l\n pro c e e d i n g s (if any), or to provi d e con s e n t for crim i n a l\n pro c e e d i n g s in case so dire ct e d by any statut o r y auth o r it y. ”\n\n Thus, it can be observed that a cumulative reading of the above, along with\n\n other clauses in the memorandum of settlement, indicates there will be no\n\n further complaints; however, if any ongoing prosecution exists, it will not be\n\n withdrawn. Clearly, it can be seen that the bankers, although able to settle the\n\n matter amicably, cannot withdraw the complaint or promise to do so, since the\n\n offences are non-compoundable; hence, such clauses are included. But at that\n\n time, no prosecution was pending. Time was extended, and the amount was\n\n revised on the same terms. However, before the final amount was paid, the\n\n 39/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n Bank filed the complaint in view of the default in payment within the time\n\n extended.\n\n (vi) Before this Court, the bank is not outrightly admitting that the issue\n\n has been compromised with reference to the criminal case. It states that it had\n\n to forgo a portion of its notional outstanding when it settled the issue with the\n\n petitioners. It is observed that the original borrowal as on 28/03/2013 was 30\n\n crores. When the account became NPA on 30/06/2016, the outstanding,\n\n including interest and penal interest, was Rs. 27,12,79,620/-. On 27/12/2018,\n\n the DRT-II passed a decree for Rs . 37,96,49,463/-. The original OTS was\n\n sanctioned for Rs. 31.50 crores. Since it was not paid in time, the OTS was\n\n accepted again with delayed period interest. It is stated that the Book\n\n outstanding as on 31/12/2020 is Rs. 24,98,39,153/-. Against the Notional\n\n Dues up to Rs. 31/03/2021, amounting to Rs. 38,88,89,946/-, the OTS was\n\n accepted at Rs. 33,41,58,904/-. After this offer, Rs. 8.34 crores was paid in\n\n time, but the remaining balance was not paid, leading to the lodging of this\n\n First Information report. The balance was paid on 11/05/2022, including\n\n further delayed interest of Rs. 37 Lakhs, which the bank accepted, and a NOC\n\n was issued on 23/02/2023. Subsequently, on 22/08/2024, the instant final\n\n report was filed.\n\n 40/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n (vii) The bank agrees that no additional amount is due and payable on\n\n behalf of the petitioners/accused and NOC has already been issued.\n\n (viii) In the absence of any other material, the complaint itself was\n\n triggered only due to partial payment and non-payment of the balance amount\n\n accepted during one-time settlement, and as such, it would be a challenge for\n\n the prosecution to prove the intention to cause loss to the bank, especially at\n\n the inception of the transaction.\n\n 8.1. Thus, after weighing all the facts, the balance would tilt in favour\n\n of accepting the petitioners' prayer by quashing the case based on an amicable\n\n settlement of the dues to the bank. The enforcement directorate also did not\n\n record any other allegations, and the learned counsel adopted only the\n\n objections raised by the prosecution. Since the entire loan amount was used to\n\n repay the loan of the group company to another bank on the same day, and it is\n\n clear that bank officials were aware of this from the start, with another bank\n\n realising the amount due, this tilts the case more towards a commercial\n\n consideration and does not demonstrate a serious offence against society.\n\n \n8.2. At the same time, considering the amount involved and the time\n\n 41/44\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ( Uploaded on: 08/07/2025 05:27:12 pm )\n\f Crl.O.P.Nos.30938 and 30939 of 2024\n\n taken for the petitioners to settle the amount, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme\n\n Court of India i n \nKothari Polymers\n' case (cited supra), I am of the view that a\n\n sum of Rs.30 Lakhs be imposed as costs on the petitioners, of which\n\n Rs.15 Lakhs be paid to the Central Bureau of Investigation towards\n\n investigation and prosecution costs, and Rs.15 Lakhs be paid towards the costs\n\n of the Court.

Where the High Court quashes a criminal proceeding\n having regard to the fact that the dispute between the offender\n and the victim has been settled although the offences are not\n compoundable, it does so as in its opinion, continuation of\n criminal proceedings will be an exercise in futility and justice in\n the case demands that the dispute between the parties is put to an\n end and peace is restored; securing the ends of justice being the\n ultimate guiding factor. No doubt, crimes are acts which have\n harmful effect on the public and consist in wrongdoing that\n seriously endangers and threatens the well-being of the society\n and it is not safe to leave the crime-doer only because he and the\n victim have settled the dispute amicably or that the victim has\n been paid compensation, yet certain crimes have been made\n compoundable in law, with or without the permission of the\n court. In respect of serious offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\n etc., or other offences of mental depravity under \nIPC\n or offences\n of moral turpitude under special statutes, like the \nPrevention of\n Corruption Act\n or the offences committed by public servants\n while working in that capacity, the settlement between the\n offender and the victim can have no legal sanction at all.\n However, certain offences which overwhelmingly and\n predominantly bear civil flavour having arisen out of civil,\n mercantile, commercial, financial, partnership or such like\n transactions or the offences arising out of matrimony, particularly\n relating to dowry, etc. or the family dispute, where the wrong is\n basically to the victim and the offender and the victim have\n settled all disputes between them amicably, irrespective of the\n fact that such offences have not been made compoundable, the\n High Court may within the framework of its inherent power,\n quash the criminal proceeding or criminal complaint or FIR if it\n is satisfied that on the face of such settlement, there is hardly any\n likelihood of the offender being convicted and by not quashing\n the criminal proceedings, justice shall be casualty and ends of\n justice shall be defeated.

The position that emerges from the above discussion\n can be summarised thus : the power of the High Court in\n quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise\n of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\n given to a criminal court for compounding the offences under\n Section 320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide plenitude\n with no statutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\n with the guideline engrafted in such power viz. : (i) to secure the\n ends of justice, or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\n court. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\n complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and the\n victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and\n circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed."
    },
    {
      "para_id": 456,
      "text": "However, before exercise of such power, the High Court must\n have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. Heinous\n and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder,\n rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the\n victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the\n dispute. Such offences are not private in nature and have a\n serious impact on society. Similarly, any compromise between\n the victim and the offender in relation to the offences under\n special statutes like the \nPrevention of Corruption Act\n or the\n offences committed by public servants while working in that\n capacity, etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal\n proceedings involving such offences. But the criminal cases\n having overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand\n on a different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly\n the offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,\n partnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\n matrimony relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where\n the wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the parties\n have resolved their entire dispute. In this category of cases, the\n High Court may quash the criminal proceedings if in its view,\n because of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\n the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and continuation\n of the criminal case would put the accused to great oppression\n and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him by\n not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete\n settlement and compromise with the victim. In other words, the\n High Court must consider whether it would be unfair or contrary\n to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding"
