M. Mangukiya, the\ntrial against the applicant would be a futile exercise in view of\nacquittal of the main accused.\n\n3. The brief facts giving rise to the present petition are\nstated as under :-\n\n3.1 That as per the FIR dated 7.3.2021 lodged by one\nMubinabibi Nazir Ahmed Shaikh, she has stated that main accused\nShafik Shaikh who happens to be husband of the daughter of sister\nof the first informant has lured the daughter of the first informant\n(victim girl) aged about 13 years by giving false promise of\nmarriage and thereby developed intimated relations with her and\nas the victim girl was found pregnant, the said Shafik Shaikh took\nher in the Hospital and admitted and aborted the child and\nthereafter has threatened them to kill her. As per the FIR, it is\nstated that when when the first informant found a baby bump, upon\ninquiry, the victim girl has stated that why are you asking me about\nbaby bump, you should ask about it to Shafik. Therefore, when the\nfirst informant inquired from Shafik, he confessed that he was\nhaving love affair with the victim girl since last two years and,\ntherefore, he asked the victim girl to marry with him. When the\nfirst informant shown her inability to marry her daughter with\nShafik on account of her tender age as well as on account of the\nfact that accused No.1 happens to be relative, he abused her and\nran away. Thereafter, on the next day, the first informant along\nwith her husband went to her sister's residence to discuss the\n\n Page 2 of 7\n\n Downloaded on : Wed Jul 03 20:52:14 IST 2024\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/11512/2024 ORDER DATED: 01/07/2024\n\n undefined\n\naforesaid and came late. On the next day, she found that the victim\ngirl was not having baby bump and, therefore, upon inquiry, the\nvictim girl said that Shafik had come to her residence and promised\nher to marry on a condition to abort the child and, therefore, she\ntrusted his version and, therefore, she was taken to hospital at\nDindoli where abortion had taken place and, thereafter she was\ndropped back at her residence. Therefore, considering the fact\nthat the family would loose her and that this would affect the\nreputation of the family, she remained silent and thereafter also, as\nShafik started visiting her family and started threatening them that\nif they do not arrange for victim girl's marriage with him, they\nwould be killed, the FIR was registered.\n\n4. Thereafter, initially when the FIR was registered, the\nsame was registered only against accused - Shafik and\nsubsequently, during the course of investigation, present applicant\nwas arraigned as accused when the charge-sheet was filed and\noffences punishable under Sections 3 (2) of Pre-Conception and\nPre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994 as well as \nSections 201\n\nand \n176\n of the Indian Penal Code were added in the FIR vide\napplication dated 18.6.2021 made by the Investigating Officer of\nthe concerned Police Station. The applicant who is a Doctor has\nrightly carried out the abortion of the victim girl aged 13 years\nwhen she was carrying pregnancy of around six months stated in\nthe FIR (if converted into weeks, the same would come to around\n24 weeks).\n\n5.

He further\nsubmitted that when the main accused is acquitted on account of\nbenefit of doubt, nothing remains in the trial of the applicant and if\nthe applicant is permitted to face the trial, the same would be a\nfutile exercise.\n\n6. According to learned advocate Mr. B. M. Mangukiya,\nthough the applicant's trial has not yet commenced, in view of\nprovisions of \nSection 157\n of the Indian Evidence Act, the evidence\nin respect of the trial of accused No.1 would be admissible in the\ntrial of the present applicant also and can be considered to quash\nthe impugned FIR and consequential proceedings qua the present\napplicant. He further submitted that in view of the medical papers\nsubmitted by Police, an opinion has been obtained from the\nGovernment Medical College which has opined that no drugs have\nbeen administered to the victim girl for medical termination of\npregnancy. Therefore, even the charges under the PNDT Act also\nwould not be sustainable. By making the aforesaid submission,\nlearned advocate Mr. B. M. Mangukiya prayed to quash the\nimpugned FIR and all consequential proceedings arising out of the\nsaid FIR.\n\n7. Though averments have been made and the copies of\nthe orders have been annexed in the petition about earlier\nquashing petitions filed by the applicant being Special Criminal\nApplication No.4199 of 2021 which was withdrawn vide order\ndated 14.6.2021 and thereafter filed another quashing petition\nbeing Special Criminal Application No.6725 of 2021 which was also\nwithdrawn vide order dated 4.8.2021 with a liberty to file an\n\n Page 4 of 7\n\n Downloaded on : Wed Jul 03 20:52:14 IST 2024\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/11512/2024 ORDER DATED: 01/07/2024\n\n undefined\n\napplication for discharge before the competent Court as well as\nanother quashing petition, learned advocate Mr. B. M. Mangukiya\ndid not brought the aforesaid aspect expressly to the notice of this\nCourt during his arguments.\n\n8. I have heard learned advocate appearing for the\napplicant and perused the record. Upon hearing learned advocate\nfor the applicant, as the record was bulky, on 26.6.2024, the matter\nwas kept for orders today i.e. 1.7.2024.\n\n9. From the perusal of the record, I found that the\nallegation against the main accused was of rape and under the\nprovisions of \nPOCSO Act\n. The FIR was initially registered under\nthe provisions of 363, 366, 312, 313, 506, 376(2)(f), 376(2)(i),\n294(b), 506(2) of the \nIndian Penal Code\n as well as Sections 3(a), 4,\n5(j)2, 5(k), 5(L), 7, 8, 5(N) and 5(q) of the Prevention of Children\nfrom Sexual Offences Act. Subsequently, \nSections 201\n and \n176\n of\nthe Indian Penal Code as well as Section 3 (2) of the PNDT Act\nwere added in the FIR and charge-sheet was filed for the said\noffences on 15.4.2021 wherein the applicant was shown as\nabsconding accused. Thereafter, the applicant preferred an\napplication under \nSection 438\n of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973 seeking anticipatory bail being Criminal Misc. Application\nNo.15863 of 2021 wherein the coordinate Bench of this Court vide\norder dated 16.9.2021 issued rule and protected the applicant by\npassing an order of not to arrest the applicant till the next date of\nhearing. Ultimately, from the record it seems that the relief\ngranted in favour of the applicant continued till 8.2.2024 and\ncoordinate Bench of this Court vide order dated 8.2.2024 passed in\nCriminal Misc. Application No.15863 of 2021 granted anticipatory\n\n Page 5 of 7\n\n Downloaded on : Wed Jul 03 20:52:14 IST 2024\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/11512/2024 ORDER DATED: 01/07/2024\n\n undefined\n\nbail to the applicant.\n\n10. In the meantime, quashing petition was filed by the\napplicant being Special Criminal Application No.4199 of 2021\nwhich was withdrawn vide order dated 14.6.2021 and thereafter\nthe applicant had preferred quashing petition being Special\nCriminal Application No.6725 of 2021 which was withdrawn on\n\n4.8.2021 with a view to file discharge application before the\ncompetent Court.\n\n11. In the meantime, the trial qua the main accused\ncommenced and completed and he was acquitted by giving him\nbenefit of doubt vide judgment dated 15.9.2022 in Special (POCSO)\nCase No.103 of 2021 passed by the learned 2 nd Additional Sessions\nJudge, Surat which would indicate that the trial qua the applicant is\nnot even commenced and no charge is framed against him.\n\n12. Considering the aforesaid facts as well as considering\nthe fact that the allegations against the main accused were of\ncommitting a rape on a minor girl who happen to be daughter of\nthe paternal aunt of his wife and, therefore, he was the one against\nwhom there were allegations of rape and offence under the\nprovisions of \nPOCSO Act\n, whereas the role of the applicant is\ndifferent. It is alleged that the applicant has abated in crime by\ndoing abortion of a minor girl illegally and hence, during the course\nof investigation, the offence of Section 3 (2) of PNDT Act read with\n\nSections 201\n and \n176\n of the Indian Penal Code were added.\nConsidering the aforesaid aspect, as the role of the present\napplicant viz.a.viz role of the main accused are different as well as\nconsidering the fact that the main accused has not been acquitted\n\n Page 6 of 7\n\n Downloaded on : Wed Jul 03 20:52:14 IST 2024\n\n NEUTRAL CITATION\n\n R/CR.MA/11512/2024 ORDER DATED: 01/07/2024\n\n undefined\n\nby giving him clean acquittal beyond any doubt, but he was\nacquitted on the basis of granting him benefit of doubt, so also\nconsidering the fact that the nature and standard of proof in\nrespect of present applicant and co-accused would be considered\nconsidering the different role in the offence in question, prima\nfacie, no case for quashing can be said to have been made out.\nAccordingly, the present application is required to be dismissed\nand the same is dismissed.\n\n (NIRZAR S.
