In the State of Himachal Pradesh, Tehsildari\n\nService is regulated by the Himachal Pradesh Tehsildari\n\nService Rules, 1973 (for short, \"Tehsildari Rules\"). Rule 7 (1)\n\nof the ibid rules provide as under:\n\n\"7(1) Recruitment to the service shall be\nmade in the following manner:-\n\n(a) 50% by selection of Naib Tehsildars who have four\nyears continuous substantive/ officiating service in\nthe grade;\n\n(b) 30% from Class 'A' candidate; and\n\n(c) 20% from Class 'B' candidate.\"\n\n3. The Class 'A' candidates are those who are\n\nselected by way of direct recruitment on the basis of an\n\nexamination and a viva-voce test on the same pattern as\n\nmay be prescribed for recruitment to the Himachal\n\nAdministrative Services. The direct recruits are\n\nrecommended by the Public Service Commission on the\n\nreceipt of requisition from Financial Commissioner. The\n\ndirect recruits are then accepted by the Financial\n\nCommissioner as Class 'A' candidates in the year in which\n\nthey are recommended by the Commission. Thereafter one\n\nyear training; service as Naib Tehsildar for another one year\n3 2024:HHC:9577\n\nand passing of departmental examination within two years is\n\nrequired for declaration by the Financial Commissioner of\n\ncandidate as qualified for appointment to the post of\n\nTehsildar.\n\n4. The petitioners, in CWPOA 1224 of 2019 and\n\nCWPOA 1386 of 2019 were Class 'A' Tehsildars. They were\n\naccepted as Class 'A' Tehsildars on 26.12.1997 and\n\n16.01.1998 respectively.\n\n5. Similarly, the Naib Tehsildari Service in the state\n\nis regulated by the Himachal Pradesh Naib Tehsildars\n\nService Rules, 1973. As per these rules, the posts of Naib\n\nTehsildars are also filled from three categories, directly\n\nthrough competitive examination i.e. \"A\" class candidates;\n\nfrom amongst certain categories of ministerial staff i.e. \"B\"\n\nclass and by promotion of Kanungo as per rota and quota\n\nlaid down in Himachal Pradesh Naib Tehsildars Service\n\nRules, 1973 and the procedure of recruitment is same as in\n\nthe case of Tehsildars.\n\n6. The petitioners in CWPOA 1195 of 2019 were the\n\n\"A\" Class accepted Naib Tehsildar candidates in 1983.\n\n4 2024:HHC:9577\n\n7. Respondent No.1 vide notification dated\n\n7.10.1998 regularized the ad-hoc promotions of 41 Naib\n\nTehsildars to the post of Tehsildar (Class-1 Gazetted) in\n\nrelaxation of rule 16 (ii) of Tehsildari Rules with immediate\n\neffect. A tentative seniority list of Tehsildars as it stood on\n\n31.12.1998 was circulated on 25.2.1999. In the said\n\ntentative seniority list, the placement of petitioners was\n\nabove the respondents in CWPOA No. 1224 of 2019 and as\n\nper said petitioners, for such reasons, they had not raised\n\nany objection with respect to said tentative seniority list. The\n\npetitioners in CWPOA 1195 of 2019 had, however, objected\n\nto the issuance of notification dated 7.10.1998 and tentative\n\nseniority list dated 25.2.1999.\n\n8. The final seniority list was issued on 1.6.1999\n\nshowing seniority position as on 31.12.1996. In the said\n\nfinal seniority list, names of 41 Tehsildars regularized vide\n\nnotification dated 7.10.1998 also found mention. As per\n\nrespondent No.1, ad-hoc Tehsildars whose ad-hoc\n\npromotions followed without break and regularization were\n\nregularized and adjusted by treating them regular from the\n5 2024:HHC:9577\n\ndate, posts in the promotion quota were available to their\n\nshare.\n\n9. The petitioners in CWPOA 1224 of 2019 and\n\nCWPOA 1195 of 2019 represented against the final seniority\n\nlist dated 1.6.1999. Having failed to receive any response to\n\ntheir representation, petitioners preferred Original\n\nApplications before the erstwhile H.P. Administrative\n\nTribunal, which later came to be transferred to this Court\n\nand are the petitions being decided hereby as CWPOA No.\n\n1224 of 2019 and CWPOA 1195 of 2019.\n\n10. The regularization order dated 7.10.1998 and\n\nfinal seniority list of Tehsildars dated 1.6.1999 has been\n\nassailed not only by the petitioners in CWPOA No. 1224 of\n\n2019 but by the beneficiaries of the regularization\n\nnotification dated 7.10.1998 by way of CWPOA 1195 of\n\n2019. The challenge in CWPOA 1224 of 2019 is on the\n\ngrounds that the regularization of ad-hoc Tehsildars was\n\nnotified w.e.f. 7.10.1998 and hence they could not be\n\nassigned seniority from anterior date and also that since the\n\nad-hoc promotions of Naib Tehsildars to the post of\n\nTehsildars were dehors the relevant service rules the period\n6 2024:HHC:9577\n\nfor which they officiated as such could not be considered for\n\nany purpose whatsoever. In CWPOA 1195 of 2019 challenge\n\nhas been laid on the premise that the seniority position of\n\nthe promotee Tehsildars regularized vide notification dated\n\n7.10.1998 was not correctly shown in the seniority list dated\n\n1.6.1999. The grounds as raised in CWPOA No.1195 of 2019\n\ncan be summed up as under:-\n\n(i) The cadre of Naib Tehsildars being divisional\nlevel cadre, their seniority lists were prepared\nand maintained by the respective Divisional\nCommissioners and there was no uniformity in\napplication of Naib Tehsildari Rules for the\npurpose of preparation of seniority lists in\ndifferent divisions.\n\n(ii) The integrated seniority list of Naib Tehsildar\nwas required to be prepared for the purpose of\nconsideration for selection to the post of\nTehsildar, but this exercise was completely\nmissing.\n\n(iii) The seniority of Naib Tehsildars as per Rule 20 of\nNaib Tehsildari Rules, is to be counted from the\ndate of substantive appointment, which principle\nhas also been violated.\n\n(iv) The respondents could not be given seniority as\nNaib Tehsildars from the date of their\n\nappointment especially when ad hoc appointment\nhad been made against slots fixed for \"A\" and\n7 2024:HHC:9577\n\n\"B\" Class. The private respondents were to be\nregularized from the dates/years when posts\nmeant for their quota as per roster became\navailable for regularization, whereas, they were\nillegally regularized from the date of ad hoc\nappointment. Respondent No.1 had constantly\ndefined H.P. Tehsildari Service Rules.\n\n11. The respondents vide their separate replies, have\n\ncontested the claim of the petitioners and have supported\n\nthe issuance of regularization notification dated 7.10.1998\n\nand the seniority list dated 01.06.1999.\n\n12. During the pendency of CWPOAs No. 1224 of\n\n2019 and 1195 of 2019 respondent No.1 once again\n\nregularized the services of 44 more ad-hoc Tehsildars vide\n\nnotification dated 1.3.2006. In addition to regularization of\n\nad-hoc Tehsildars, some of the Naib Tehsildars were also\n\npromoted as Tehsildars.\n\n13. Thereafter, a tentative seniority list of Tehsildars\n\nas it stood on 1.3.2006 was issued by respondent No.1 on\n\n6.7.2006. In the said tentative seniority list, petitioners in\n\nCWPOA 1224 of 2019 were shown at serial Nos.4, 5, 6 and 7\n\nrespectively. The petitioners filed representations against\n\nsaid tentative seniority list. Respondent No.1 vide memo\n8 2024:HHC:9577\n\ndated 4.10.2007 issued final seniority list of Tehsildars as it\n\nstood on 1.3.2006 maintaining the seniority position of\n\npetitioners at serial Nos.4, 5, 6 and 7 on the basis of their\n\ndates of acceptance as Class 'A' Tehsildars. The said\n\nseniority list was implemented and the petitioners were\n\nfurther promoted to the posts of District Revenue Officers on\n\nad-hoc basis vide notification dated 6.10.2007.\n\n14. Respondent No.1 issued yet another seniority list\n\non 7.10.2008 of Tehsildars as it stood on 11.9.2008. The\n\nreasons assigned for circulation of tentative seniority list\n\ndated 7.10.2008 was that in the meanwhile the seniority\n\nlists of Naib Tehsildars by respective Divisional\n\nCommissioners had been rectified in consonance with the\n\ninstructions of the Government dated 21.11.2006 and the\n\nreview DPC meeting had been held on 19, 23 and 28.8.2008.\n\nThe tentative seniority list on 7.10.2008 was circulated in\n\ncontinuation to the earlier seniority list issued on 1.6.1999\n\nand in supersession of subsequent final seniority list of\n\nTehsildars issued on 4.10.2007.\n\n15. In seniority list dated 7.10.2008, the petitioners\n\nwere placed below the private respondents in CWPOA No.\n9 2024:HHC:9577\n\n1386 of 2019. Against the treatment, which according to\n\npetitioners was arbitrary and against the rules,\n\nrepresentation was filed but without any result. Final\n\nseniority list was issued on 24.12.2008 showing the\n\nseniority position as on 11.9.2008.\n\n16. The petitioners in CWPOA 1195 of 2019 appears\n\nto have raised no objection against the regularisation\n\nnotification dated 1.3.2006, tentative seniority list dated\n\n7.10.2008 and final seniority list dated 24.12.2008.\n\n17. This seniority list has been assailed by the\n\npetitioners by way of CWPOA No. 1386 of 2019. The\n\ngrievance raised by the said petitioners is that the gradation\n\nof regularized ad-hoc Tehsildars by respondent No.1 vide\n\nnotification dated 11.9.2008 was contrary to Rules. They\n\nwere given promotions to the posts of Tehsildar from the\n\nyear 1990 onwards. Consequently, in seniority list dated\n\n24.12.2008, petitioners have been wrongly downgraded.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, the seniority in the cadre is\n\nrequired to be given from the date the incumbents were\n\nappointed on regular service. Respondents No.2 to 28 in\n\nCWPOA No. 1386 of 2019 were wrongly given benefit of\n10 2024:HHC:9577\n\nad-hoc service by placing them above the petitioners in the\n\nseniority. The said petitioners have alleged that they were\n\ndirectly and regularly appointed to the cadre of Tehsildar\n\nClass 'A'. Respondents No. 2 to 28 are promotee Tehsildars\n\nfrom Naib-Tehsildars category, therefore, they are to be given\n\nseniority from the dates they were declared as qualified by\n\nvirtue of passing the examination and acceptance by the\n\ncompetent authority. It has also been alleged that the\n\ninstructions dated 30.6.2001 and 21.11.2006 as also the\n\nagenda for review DPC, were wrongly given precedence over\n\nthe rules.\n\n18. As per petitioners in CWPOA 1386 of 2019, slots\n\nagainst which the respondents have been promoted from\n\nback dates were not available in the share of their quota.\n\nThese slots had already been exhausted by the persons of\n\nthe cadre although this was not reflected in the minutes\n\nplaced before the review Departmental Promotion\n\nCommittee. Accordingly, the impugned seniority is alleged to\n\nbe not based on true facts.\n\n19. Another grievance of the said petitioners is that\n\nrespondent No.1 wrongly gave benefit to respondents No. 2\n11 2024:HHC:9577\n\nto 28 by promoting them on regular basis to the posts of\n\nTehsildars right from the year 1990 against the vacancies in\n\nthe cadre taking into account ex-cadre posts and each and\n\nevery vacancy created during 1990 to 2006 by virtue of\n\nretirement or promotion of Tehsildars from Naib Tehsildars\n\ncategory. The vacancies caused due to the promotion,\n\nretirement or demise of Tehsildars promoted from Naib\n\nTehsildars were to be filled in the ratio of 50%, 30% and 20%\n\nfrom all the three categories as per Rule 7 of Tehsildari\n\nRules and not from the category of Naib Tehsildars promotee\n\nonly.\n\n20. It is also the concern of said petitioners that\n\nthough vide notification dated 1.3.2006, the ad-hoc\n\nTehsildars were regularized with immediate effect, but\n\nseniority assigned to them makes them regular from the\n\ndates when they were not even eligible to hold the post.\n\n21. On the other hand, to support and justify its acts\n\nof promoting the Naib-Tehsildars as Tehsildars on ad-hoc\n\nbasis from time to time, respondent No.1 has taken a stand\n\nthat since the post of Tehsildar is a functional post, it\n\ncannot be kept vacant.\n\n12 2024:HHC:9577\n\n22. As per respondent No.1, Rule 17 of Tehsildari\n\nRules provides 20-point roster to be followed for assigning\n\ninter-se seniority to the three feeder categories i.e. A Class, B\n\nClass and promotees from Naib Tehsildars in respect of a\n\nparticular year. The services of ad-hoc promotees were\n\nregularized against vacancies arising in their own quota i.e.\n\n50% by holding regular DPC. Reliance for such purpose has\n\nbeen placed on the procedure prescribed in the Department\n\nof Personnel Instructions dated 30.6.2001.\n\n23. It has also been submitted that Class 'A' and\n\nClass 'B' candidates in the first instance are accepted as\n\ncandidates for the post of Tehsildars. After undergoing\n\ntraining under Rule 14 of Tehsildari Rules, they are declared\n\nas qualified candidates under Rule 15 for appointment to\n\nthe cadre of Tehsildars. In this manner, the quota rule in\n\nrespect of appointments of Class 'A' and Class 'B' candidates\n\nis said to have been complied with on the acceptance of such\n\ncandidates, even if their formal appointments are made later\n\non after they are declared qualified for appointment under\n\nRule 15. In support of decision to make the candidates in\n\nClass 'A' and Class 'B' entitled to seniority from the date of\n13 2024:HHC:9577\n\nacceptance, reliance has also been placed on a judgment\n\npassed by erstwhile H.P. Administrative Tribunal in TA No.\n\n519 of 1986. On the strength of above, it has been\n\ncontended that by same analogy, the seniority of Naib\n\nTehsildars is also to be considered from the date of\n\nacceptance of Class 'A' and Class 'B' Naib Tehsildars in their\n\ncadre.\n\n24. Respondent No.1 has further submitted that while\n\nregularizing the ad-hoc Tehsildars vide notification dated\n\n7.10.1998, the regularization was done from such back\n\ndates when the vacancies had arisen in the quota of\n\npromotees. In this manner, 41 ad-hoc Tehsildars regularized\n\nvide notification dated 7.10.1998, were shown in the\n\nseniority list as it existed on 31.3.1996. As further\n\ncontended by respondent No.1, after September 1998, DPC\n\nfor regularization of ad-hoc Tehsildars was held in March,\n\n2006. The tentative seniority list was issued on 6.7.2006,\n\nfollowed by final seniority list on 4.10.2007. While framing\n\nthe seniority list, A & B Class appointees were assigned\n\nseniority as per their dates of acceptance. The promotees\n\nwho were considered by the DPC as per consolidated\n14 2024:HHC:9577\n\nseniority list of Naib Tehsildars were accordingly placed as\n\nper recommendations of DPC. The petitioners were\n\nsubsequently promoted as District Revenue Officers on ad\n\nhoc basis on 6.10.2007. In the meanwhile, the seniority lists\n\nof feeder category of Naib Tehsildars were re-drawn by the\n\nDivisional Commissioners Kangra, Mandi and Shimla during\n\nthe year 2007, which necessitated a review DPC for\n\nreviewing the seniority list of Tehsildars. Accordingly, the\n\nreview DPC was convened in August, 2008; tentative\n\nseniority list was issued on 7.10.2008 and final seniority list\n\nafter inviting objections was issued on 24.12.2008.\n\n25. Respondent No.1 has maintained a categoric\n\nstand that the seniority list dated 24.12.2008, was prepared\n\nin accordance with law. The correct vacancy position was\n\nworked out by the Department and placed before the DPC,\n\nwhereafter the seniority list was issued on 24.12.2008. The\n\npromotee Naib Tehsildars were assigned the seniority from\n\nthe dates when the posts were available in their quota. No\n\nex-cadre post had been taken into account while assigning\n\nthe seniority to the Naib Tehsildars. It has been pleaded that\n15 2024:HHC:9577\n\nthe quota of 50% of the cadre post falling to the share of\n\nNaib Tehsildars was not exceeded at any point of time.\n\n26. Respondent No.1 also has taken a stand that the\n\npetitioners having been promoted as District Revenue\n\nOfficers on ad hoc basis, were not proposed to be reverted.\n\n27. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and\n\nhave also gone through the records of the case carefully.\n\n28. CWPOA No. 1224 of 2019 is filed by four\n\npetitioners, whereas CWPOA No. 1386 of 2019 is filed by\n\nthree petitioners only (petitioners No. 1 to 3 in CWPOA No.\n\n1224 of 2019), the 4th petitioner Ms. Sushma in CWPOA No.\n\n1224 of 2019 has not joined the other petitioners in CWPOA\n\nNo. 1386 of 2019.\n\n29. The Tehsildars promoted on ad-hoc basis from\n\ntime to time, were ordered to be regularized vide notification\n\ndated 7.10.1998 issued by the 1st respondent. According to\n\nsaid notification, the regularization was ordered from\n\nimmediate effect and by relaxing Rule 16 (ii) of Tehsildari\n\nRules. A tentative seniority list showing the seniority\n\nposition as on 31.3.1998 was circulated vide office\n\nmemorandum dated 26.02.1999. The petitioners were placed\n16 2024:HHC:9577\n\nabove the Tehsildars regularized vide notification dated\n\n7.10.1998, therefore, the petitioners did not raise any\n\nobjection. However, respondent No.1 issued final seniority\n\nlist dated 1.6.1999 showing seniority position as on\n\n31.12.1996, which included the names of Tehsildars\n\nregularized w.e.f. 7.10.1998. It was specifically mentioned in\n\nthe forwarding memorandum dated 1.6.1999 that the ad-hoc\n\nTehsildars whose promotions were followed without break\n\nand regularization had suitably been adjusted by treating\n\nthem regular from the date posts in the promotion quota\n\nwere available to their share.\n\n30. The petitioners in CWPOA No. 1224 of 2019\n\nassailed the above noticed decision of respondent No.1 by\n\nseeking relief to the following effect:-\n\n\"(i) Declare the act of the respondent-State whereby\nvide the impugned final seniority list dated 1.6.1999,\nit has regularized the promotions of the private\nrespondents 2 to 42 to the post of Tehsildar from Naib\nTehsildar with retrospective effect and thus made\napplicants junior to them, ignoring the fact that the\napplicants were directly recruited to the said post prior\nto order of regularization of ad hoc promotion of private\nrespondents as Tehsildars with immediate effect vide\norder dated 7.10.1998, and further declare the act of\n17 2024:HHC:9577\n\nthe respondents of omitting the name of the applicants\nfrom the seniority list by preparing it to reflect the\nposition as on 31.12.1996 and not as on 31.12.1998\nand taking this decision at the back of the applicants\nwithout any notice to the applicants in this regard as\narbitrary, discriminatory against the principles of\nnatural justice, defeats the legitimate expectation of the\napplicants and is hence violative of\nArticle 14\nand\nof\nthe Constitution of India and quash seniority list dated\n1.6.1999 qua respondents 2 to 42.\"\n\n31. Respondent No.1 vide notification dated 1.3.2006\n\nyet again ordered regularization of services of ad hoc\n\nTehsildars besides promotion of Naib Tehsildars to the post\n\nof Tehsildar (Class-I Gazetted) on regular basis with\n\nimmediate effect. On 6.7.2006, a tentative seniority list of\n\nsubstantive Tehsildars as it stood on 1.3.2006 was\n\ncirculated. The final seniority list of Tehsildars as it stood on\n\n1.3.2006 was circulated on 4.10.2007 reflecting the same\n\nposition as in the tentative seniority list dated 6.7.2006. The\n\npetitioners accepted the said seniority list. The fact of the\n\nmatter is that petitioners were promoted as District Revenue\n\nOfficers on ad-hoc basis vide notification dated 6.10.2007.\n\n32. Respondent No.1 issued another tentative\n\nseniority list on 7.10.2008 of Tehsildars as it stood on\n18 2024:HHC:9577\n\n11.9.2008. In the said tentative seniority list, the seniority\n\nposition of petitioners was downgraded and they were placed\n\nafter the private respondents in CWPOA No. 1386 of 2019.\n\nThe petitioners unsuccessfully objected against the said\n\ntentative seniority list dated 7.10.2008. Lastly, final seniority\n\nlist of Tehsildars as it stood on 11.9.2008 was circulated on\n\n24.12.2008 maintaining the same seniority position as\n\nshown in tentative seniority list dated 7.10.2008.\n\n33. The petitioners in CWPOA No. 1386 of 2019 then\n\ncame up seeking following reliefs:\n\n\"(i) That the writ in the nature of certiorari may kindly\nbe issued for quashing the final seniority list\n(Annexure P-11) issued by respondent No.1 on\n24.12.2008 whereby the petitioners have been\nillegally downgraded. Similarly, the impugned\nnotification dated 11.9.2008 (Annexure P-12),\nwhereby the respondents No. 2 to 28 have been\ngiven regular promotions from the year 1990\nonwards against the provisions of Rules may be\nquashed and set-aside.\n\n(ii) That the writ or order may kindly be issued\ndirecting the respondent No.1 to reassign the\nseniority to the petitioners at appropriate places\naccording to the date of their appointment.\"\n\n19 2024:HHC:9577\n\n34. The memorandum dated 7.10.2008 whereby the\n\ntentative seniority list of Tehsildars as it stood on 11.9.2008\n\nwas circulated, recorded that the said list was circulated in\n\ncontinuation to earlier final seniority list of Tehsildars dated\n\n1.6.1999 and in supersession of subsequent final seniority\n\nlist dated 4.10.2007. In other words the final seniority list\n\ndated 1.6.1999 showing the seniority position as on\n\n31.12.1996 was kept in continuation while preparing the\n\ntentative seniority list of Tehsildars as it stood on 11.9.2008\n\nvide memorandum dated 7.10.2008. The seniority list dated\n\n4.10.2007 showing the seniority position of Tehsildars as on\n\n1.3.2006 was superseded. Thus, the cause raised by the\n\npetitioners in CWPOA No. 1224 of 2019 remained alive.\n\n35. The grievance of the petitioners in CWPOA 1224 of\n\n2019 and CWPOA 1386 of 2019 is that firstly the grant of\n\nregular status as Tehsildars to the private respondents in\n\nCWPOA No. 1224 of 2019 vide memorandum dated 1.6.1999\n\nand thereafter the same treatment to the Tehsildars whose\n\nservices were regularized vide notification dated 1.3.2006\n\nwas against the provisions of Tehsildari rules. In CWPOA\n20 2024:HHC:9577\n\n1195/19 a similar grievance was raised alleging violation of\n\nNaib Tehsildari rules.\n\n36. Noticeably, in the first place the petitioners in any\n\nof the above cases have not laid any challenge to the ad-hoc\n\npromotions of Naib Tehsildars to the post of Tehsildars, as\n\nordered by the 1st respondent, from time to time and in the\n\nsecond the regularization of ad-hoc Tehsildars ordered by\n\nrespondent No.1 firstly vide notification dated 7.10.1998 and\n\nthereafter vide notification dated 1.3.2006 have not been\n\nchallenged as such.\n\n37. The petitioners in all the cases have shown their\n\ngrievance to the placements in seniority lists prepared and\n\ncirculated post the aforenoted regularisation orders dated\n\n7.10.1998 and 1.3.2006. They have taken exception to the\n\nretrospectivity in conferment of regular status or in\n\nalternative grant of seniority from back dates to the private\n\nrespondents in all the petitions.\n\n38. According to petitioners, both the notifications\n\ndated 7.10.1998 and 1.3.2006 were made effective from the\n\ndate of their issuance respectively and thus, the ad-hoc\n\nTehsildars whose services were regularized thereby could not\n21 2024:HHC:9577\n\nbe allowed seniority positions from any prior when they were\n\nnot even born in the cadre. It is also contended that for\n\nbeing appointed as regular Tehsildar, the requirements of\n\nTehsildari Rules were to be fulfilled and since the ad-hoc\n\nTehsildars regularized vide aforesaid notifications did not\n\nfulfill such requirements, they could not be allowed the\n\nbenefit of regularization retrospectively or in alternative the\n\nbenefit of seniority from back date.\n\n39. Respondent No.1 has taken a specific stand that\n\nthe regularized Tehsildars were given seniority from the date\n\nof their officiation as ad-hoc Tehsildars subject to availability\n\nof particular vacancy in their quota. It has also been\n\nsubmitted that the petitioners have been considered from\n\nthe date of their acceptance as Tehsildars, which has not\n\nbeen changed at any point of time. As per respondent No.1,\n\nthe post of Tehsildar being a functional post, could not be\n\nkept vacant for long and for such reason ad-hoc promotions\n\nwere made from time to time. While fixing the seniority, the\n\ndates on which the vacancies had occurred in the quota of\n\npromotees were taken into consideration and accordingly,\n22 2024:HHC:9577\n\nthe seniority was fixed from retrospective dates. To same\n\neffect has been the stand taken by the private respondents.\n\n40. In the backdrop of above noted diverse stands, an\n\nissue with disputed facts has been posed before this Court\n\nin exercise of writ jurisdiction. The petitioners have\n\nmaintained that the seniority positions assigned to\n\nrespondents as Tehsildars were from the dates when the\n\nvacancies were not available to their quota and in CWPOA\n\n1195/2019 it has also been alleged that the slots, by grant\n\nof retrospective seniority were dehors the rule of rota-quota\n\nprescribed in relevant service rules.\n\n41. The petitioners in CWPOA 1224/2019 and\n\nCWPOA 1386/2019 have not been able to discharge their\n\nburden by placing on record unimpeachable material to\n\nestablish their allegations.\n\n42. Though the petitioners in CWPOA 1195/19 have\n\ntries to exemplify the instances of violation of rules including\n\nrule of rota quota, but they have kept their challenge limited\n\nagainst the regularisation notification dated 7.10.1998 and\n\nconsequent seniority list dated 1.6.1999, whereas much\n\nwater has flown thereafter more particularly another\n23 2024:HHC:9577\n\nregularisation of ad-hoc Tehsildars took place on 1.3.2006\n\nfollowed by circulation of final seniority list dated\n\n24.12.2008 on the basis of review DPC held after redrawal of\n\nseniority lists of Naib Tehsildars and such subsequent\n\nremained unchallenged by the said petitioners.\n\n43. The petitioners have also not been able to\n\ncontrovert the stand of respondent No.1 that the seniority\n\nwas assigned to the ad-hoc Tehsildars after their\n\nregularization from the dates the slot in their own quota of\n\n50% were available.\n\n44. Thus, in absence of the discharge of necessary\n\nburden by the petitioners to prove violation of relevant\n\nservice rules while granting seniority positions to the parties\n\nvide seniority lists dated 1.6.1999 and 24.12.2008 and also\n\nin absence of any impeccable material to establish their\n\ncontention, this court is unable to find any fault with the\n\nadministrative actions impugned by way of these petitions.\n\n45. Another ground taken by respondent No.1 is that\n\nthe post of Naib Tehsildar is governed by its own service\n\nrules known as 'Naib-Tehsildari Rules'. It is a divisional level\n\ncadre. The seniority list of Naib Tehsildars is maintained by\n24 2024:HHC:9577\n\nrespective Divisional Commissioners in each of the divisions\n\nof Shimla, Mandi and Dharamshala. The Divisional\n\nCommissioners had not applied uniform parameters for\n\nmaintaining the seniority lists of Naib Tehsildars in their\n\nrespective Divisions, therefore, there were several anomalies\n\nin the consolidated seniority list of Naib Tehsildars prepared\n\nfor consideration of their promotion to the post of Tehsildar.\n\nVarious representations were pending before the competent\n\nauthority. The rectification in terms of rules were made and\n\nthe anomalies in consolidated seniority list of Naib\n\nTehsildars were removed which necessitated the holding of\n\nreview DPC and consequent issuance of the tentative\n\nseniority list dated 7.10.2008 followed by final seniority list\n\ndated 24.12.2008. Respondent No.1 has also submitted that\n\nsince the date of acceptance of petitioners as Tehsildars was\n\nconsidered as relevant date for placing them in seniority list,\n\nthe same principle was applied in the case of Naib\n\nTehsildars also.\n\n46. The petitioners have not been able to rebut above\n\nfactual position nor have they come up with any additional\n\nmaterial to challenge the process of redetermination of\n25 2024:HHC:9577\n\nseniority lists of Naib Tehsildars at divisional level or\n\nconsequent integrated seniority list of such cadre prepared\n\nfor promotion to the next higher cadre of Tehsildar.\n\n47. The proposition that seniority can be fixed from\n\nback date cannot be disputed in light of principles laid down\n\nin\nDirect Recruit Class II Engineers Officers Association Vs State\n\nof Maharashtra\n(1990) 2 SCC 715 (hereinafter referred to as\n\n'Direct Recruits\ncase').\n\nThe relevant extract from\nDirect\n\nRecruits\ncase is reproduced hereunder:\n\n\"47. To sum up, we hold that:\n\n(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule,\nhis seniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment\nand not according to the date of his confirmation.\n\nThe corollary of the above rule is that where the initial\nappointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made\nas a stop-gap arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot\nbe taken into account for considering the seniority.\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the\nprocedure\nlaid down by\nthe rules but the appointee continues in\nthe post uninterruptedly till the regularization of his service in\naccordance with the rules, the period of officiating service will\nbe counted.\"\n\n48.\nIn one of the numerous interpretations to the\n\nprinciples enunciated in\nDirect Recruits\nCase Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nSantosh Kumar v. State of A.P.\n(2003) 5 SCC 511\n\nexpounded as under:\n\n26 2024:HHC:9577\n\n10. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Direct Recruit Class II Engg.\n\nOfficers' Assn.\ncase (1990) 2 SCC 715 after considering various aspects\nand earlier decisions, summed up the conclusions in para 47 of the\njudgment. For our purpose paras (A) and (B) of the said paragraph are\nrelevant, which are extracted hereunder : (SCC pp. 744-45)\n\"47. To sum up, we hold that:\n\n(A) Once an incumbent is appointed to a post according to rule, his\nseniority has to be counted from the date of his appointment and not\naccording to the date of his confirmation.\n\nThe corollary of the above rule is that where the initial appointment is\nonly ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stopgap\narrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account\nfor considering the seniority.\n\n(B) If the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure\n\nlaid down by\nthe rules but the appointee continues in the post\nuninterruptedly till the regularisation of his service in accordance with\nthe rules, the period of officiating service will be counted.\"\n\nThe respondent and others were appointed as Sub-Inspectors out of\nseniority looking to the outstanding merit and record prior to the direct\nrecruits like the appellant. Their services were admittedly regularised\nby relaxing the Service Rules in exercise of power available under Rule\n47 of the General Rules. The appellant did not challenge the validity of\nRule 47 and no mala fides were established against the authorities in\nexercise of powers of relaxation under the said Rule. The Tribunal has\nrecorded a finding that the Rule relating to the method of recruitment\nwas not relaxed but only the conditions which had to be fulfilled for the\npurpose of promotion to the category of Sub-Inspector were relaxed;\nthis finding is not disturbed by the High Court; there was no relaxation\nas to the basic qualification; the State Government regularised the\nservices of the respondent and others with retrospective effect from\nthe date they were temporarily appointed as Sub-Inspectors (OSSIs). It\nis also not disputed that they continued in service uninterruptedly for\nabout 12-13 years till their services were regularised with retrospective\neffect. This being the factual position it could not be said that the\ncorollary to para 47(A) of the aforementioned Constitution Bench\njudgment applies to the facts of the present case. Once their services\nwere regularised it cannot be contended that their initial appointment\nwas only on ad hoc basis and not according to the rules and made as a\nstop gap arrangement. On the other hand para 47(B) supports the case\nof the respondent.\n\n49. Hence, even the period of ad-hoc promotion can\n\nbe considered for the purposes of seniority provided the\n27 2024:HHC:9577\n\nsame is followed by regularization and is in terms of relevant\n\nservice rules. The fact that the petitioners have not laid\n\nattack to the regularization of respondents, as such,\n\nimpliedly the petitioners have not found any fault in the ad-\n\nhoc promotions of the private respondents ordered by\n\nrespondent No.1 from time to time. The only evident\n\nobjection has been raised with reference to the relaxation\n\nclause included in notification dated 7.10.1998, but later\n\nwhen respondent No.1 has raised the plea that relaxation\n\nwas with respect to Rule 16 (iv) of Tehsildari Rules and not\n\nRules 16 (ii), the petitioners have not been able to further\n\ncontrovert the same. Rule 16 (iv) deals with the requirement\n\nof a Naib Tehsildar to work in tribal/hard area for three\n\nyears and it has not been disputed by the petitioners that\n\nsuch a condition could not have been relaxed or was so\n\nfundamental that the Naib Tehsildar could not have been\n\nconsidered for promotion in absence thereof. No other\n\nillegality, infirmity or irregularity has been pointed out by\n\nthe petitioners in the ad-hoc promotions of the private\n\nrespondents.\n\n28 2024:HHC:9577\n\n50. Learned counsel for petitioners in CWPOA 1224 of\n\n2019 and 1386 of 2019 has placed reliance on judgments\n\npassed by Supreme Court in the matter of Suraj Parkash\n\nGupta and others Vs State of J&K and others (2000) 7 SCC 561\n\nand Union of India Vs Dharampal (2009) 4 SCC 170 to contend\n\nthat the power to relax rules is not absolute. In my\n\nconsidered view the precedent so relied on behalf of\n\npetitioners has no application in instant cases for the\n\nreasons firstly that the Suraj Parkash Gupta (supra) was in the\n\ncontext of specific requirement under J&K (CCA) Rules,\n\n1956 and secondly as held above the relaxation of rule 16(iv)\n\nof Tehsildari rules in the instant cases was neither proved to\n\nbe beyond the power of the government nor so fundamental\n\nwhich could render the consideration of Naib Tehsildar for\n\nselection to the post of Tehsildar void. Rather, para 69 of the\n\nSuraj Parkash Gupta as reproduced hereafter supports the\n\ncase of respondents:\n\n\"69. Thus, there is overwhelming authority of this\nCourt to hold that ad hoc, stopgap service could be\nregularised from an anterior date after consulting the\nService Commission from the date of vacancy in the\npromotee quota, after considering fitness, eligibility,\nsuitability and ACRs. Therefore, the ad hoc/stopgap\n29 2024:HHC:9577\n\nservice rendered by promotees beyond six months\nand without the consent of the Public Service\nCommission as per Regulation 4(d)(ii) cannot be\ntreated as non est. It can be regularised later after\nconsulting the Commission in respect of posts in the\npromotion quota and subject to eligibility and\nsuitability based on ACRs, etc. Only the period\nrendered outside the quota or the period rendered\nwithin the quota when the promotee was not eligible\nor found fit has to be excluded.\"\n\n51. The reliance placed by petitioners on\nR.K.\n\nMobisana Vs Kh. Themba Singh\n(2008) 1 SCC 747, Union of India\n\nVs Dharampal (2009) 4 SCC 170 and Narayana Rao Vs Union of\n\nIndia (2010) 9 JT 346 to contend that since the ad hoc\n\npromotions of private respondents were dehors the rules\n\nsuch service could not be considered for seniority purposes\n\nalso does not help their cause in view of what has been held\n\nabove in respect of failure of petitioners to prove violation of\n\nany service rule while granting ad-hoc promotions to the\n\nprivate respondents.\n\n52. This Court was informed that the majority of\n\npetitioners and private respondents have already retired. In\n\nabsence of petitioners pointing out instances where the\n\nprivate respondents have been granted seniority from a date\n\nwhen the vacancy was not existing in the quota of\n30 2024:HHC:9577\n\npromotees, this Court does not find any reason to show\n\ninterference in exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 226\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. Moreover, such an exercise will\n\namount to unsettling of long standing settled seniority\n\npositions, which otherwise is impermissible. Reference can\n\nbe made to recent reiteration of said principle by Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in\nV. Vincent Velankanni Vs Union of India\n\nand others\n2024 INSC 748\n\n53. As notices above, the petitioners in CWPOA\n\n1195/2019 had already given up their chase half way by not\n\nlaying any challenge to subsequent regularisation of ad-hoc\n\nTehsildars on 1.3.2006 and consequent circulation of final\n\nseniority list dated 24.12.2008, therefore, the reliefs prayed\n\nby them have become infructuous.\n\n54. In light of what has been discussed above all the\n\nthree petitions are dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\n55. Pending miscellaneous application(s), if any, also\n\nstand disposed of.\n\n4th October, 2024 (Satyen Vaidya)\n(GR) Judge",
