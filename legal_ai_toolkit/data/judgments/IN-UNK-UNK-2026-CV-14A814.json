Shorn of unnecessary details, the briefly stated facts, as adumbrated by\nthe applicants, necessary for the resolution in the lis, are as follows:-\n\n The applicants are three in number superannuated from the post of\nTrackmen under Senior Section Engineer (Path-Way), East Central Railway,\nMokama,Danapur Division, district-Patna. The service details of the applicants\nas stated in the OA as under:\n\n Sl. Name of applicants. Date of Date of grant of Year of Date of\n No. engagement as Temporary Status. regularization on Superannuation.\n\n casual worker. regular temporary\n post\n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n 1.

The applicants have further stated that respondents have not counted\ntowards qualifying service for pension and pensionary benefits rendered as casual\nlabour before obtaining the temporary status and the applicants are entitled for\n100 % counting of service rendered after obtaining temporary status till they are\nregularized on the regular post, whereas respondents reckoned only 50% of their\nservice as temporary status casual worker.\n\n5. It is also the case of the applicants that in similar facts and identical legal\nissue this Tribunal in O.A. No. 505/2005, titled as Manikant Jha Versus Union\nof India & ors allowed the O.A. vide order dated 02.09.2006 in O.A. No.\n ::3:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n505/2005. Thereafter, Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal\n(Civil) No.(s) 20041/2008 titled as \nUnion of India and others versus Sarju\n\nwith four connected cases vide order dated 30.09.2011 (Annexure A-3) upheld\nthe orders of this Tribunal and Hon'ble High Court Patna and directed to\nrespondents to count the full service, 100% period of service of casual worker\nafter obtaining temporary status till they are regularized on a regular post and\nresultantly all the S.L.P. were dismissed.\n\n6. The applicants have also stated that this Tribunal in the batch of 29 similar\noriginal applications with lead case O.A. No. 657/2012 allowed vide common\norder dated 07.11.2014 and directed respondents to count 100% continuous\nservice towards pensionary benefits if otherwise admissible from the period of\ntemporary status till date of regularization and thereafter till date of\nsuperannuation and to count 50% for period of continuous services rendered as\ncasual labour till date of obtaining temporary status with liberty to the\nrespondents to verify the service and other records of the employee for\nascertaining genuineness. The applicants also claiming similar benefits as\ngranted by this Tribunal in similar cases O.A. No. 317/2016 (Patna) Mandish\nVersus Union of India & ors decided on 17.05.2016.\n\n7. Per contra, the respondents have contested the claim of the applicants by\nfiling the Written Statement that applicants have retired and all admissible\nbenefits paid to them. The Para 2005 of IREM-Vol.I stipulates that casual\nlabour on grant of temporary status and thereafter regularized by way of\nabsorption in the railway service on regular post than the casual labour are\nentitled to count 50% service period from date of temporary status to date of\nregularization on regular post for purposes of pension and other benefits. The\nPara 20 of Master Circular No. 54 dated 30.09.1994 also recognizes legal right\nof casual labour to count 50% period of service after attainment of temporary\nstatus if followed by absorption in service as regular railway employee for\nreckoning for pensionasry benefits. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nGeneral Manager, North West Rly & Ors Versus Chanda Devi, (2008) 2\nSCC 108 also considered nature of employment of casual labour who was\ngranted temporary status after referring to Rule 2001, 2002 and 2005 of the\nIREM and held that Rule 2005 of IREM Vol.-I has statutory force and lays\n ::4:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\ndown entitlement and privileges available to the casual labour with temporary\nstatus.\n\n8. The respondents have further stated Railway Service (Pension) Rules-\n\n1993 (for brevity hereinafter referred as Pension Rules 1993) that as per Rule\n21 the engagement as period in causal labour capacity not to be treated as\nqualifying services for pension etc. Thus as per Rule, Para 2005 of the IREM\nVol.-I and Para 20 of Master Circular No.54, the 50% of services of casual\nservice after obtaining temporary status till date of regularization and 100% of\nservice from date of regular posting till date of superannuation to be counted as\nqualifying services for pension purpose.\n\n9. The respondents also submitted in the WS that Hon'ble Supreme Court in\ncase of \nUnion of India and ors versus Rakesh Kumar\n reported in (2017)\n13SCC 388 has relied on Rule 20 & 31 Note-1 of Pension Rules 1993 read with\nPara 20 of Master Circular No.54 and Para 2005 of IREM-1 and upheld hence\nclaim of applicants is not admissible accordance with rules.\n\n10. The rejoinder has been filed by the applicants specifically denying the\ncontentions of the respondents made in the WS and stated that applicants entitled\nfor similar treatment and 100% service to be counted for temporary status period\ninstead of 50% and 50% be also reckoned for period as casual labour before\nattaining temporary status. Thereafter respondents be directed to revise pension\nand other benefits based on laws \nlaid down in\n case of by Hon'ble Supreme Court\nand same is binding precedent and earlier judgment-in-rem and judgment in case\nof \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) in judgment in\npersonam hence not applicable. So also stated that Railway Board has issued\nletter no. E(NG) II/2014/CL/14 dated 25.11.2014 and directed to provide for\n100% of temporary status casual service rendered before absorption in regular\nemployment being treated as qualifying service for the purpose of grant of\npensionary benefits. The batch of cases decided by this Tribunal on 07.11.2014\nupheld by Hon'ble High Court on 18.08.2015 in CWJC No. 11695 of 2015 and\nno SLP preferred before the Hon'ble Supreme Court.\n\n ::5:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE APPLICANTS\n\n11. Shri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel appearing for the applicants argued that\nHon'ble Supreme Court in similar cases from Hon'ble High Court Patna titled\n\nUnion of India & ors versus Sarju\n (supra) vide order dated 30.09.2011 upheld\nthe orders of this Tribunal and directed to reckon full service, 100% period of\nservice of temporary status till they are regularized and so applicants in present\nOA superannuated between year 2005 to 2012 and entitled for similar treatment\nwith consequential benefits i.e. revised pension etc.\n\n12. Shri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel appearing for the applicants submitted\nthat order passed in case of \nUnion of India & ors versus Sarju\n (supra) is\njudgment in rem, earlier binding precedent and applicable in present case whereas\njudgment in case of \nUnion of India & ors versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) is\njudgment in personam not applicable in the present case.\n \nThe judgment dated\n30.09.2011 passed in case of \nUnion of India versus Sarju\n (supra) is applicable\nas on date of retirement in year 2005 to 2012, the judgement in case of \nUnion of\nIndia versus Sarju\n (supra) was applicable and in case of \nUnion of India versus\nRakesh Kumar\n (supra) judgment was delivered subsequently on 24th March\n2017 hence cannot be made applicable retrospectively.\n\n13. Shri M.P. Dixit, further canvassed that in case of the applicants, the\njudgment dated 30.09.2011, passed in case of \nUnion of India versus Sarju\n\n(supra) is earlier and shall prevail being judgment in rem, whereas judgment\ndated 24.03.2017 in case of \nUnion of India versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) is\nlater and same shall not be applicable in the present case on hand.\n\n14. Shri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel for the applicants, also contended that\nprior to year 2015 similarly placed employee granted reckoning benefits of 100%\nperiod of service as temporary status casual labour for pension benefits and so\napplicants cannot be discriminated based on laws \nlaid down in\n case of \nUnion of\nIndia versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra).\n\n15. Shri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel for the applicants, during arguments laid\nmuch emphasis on law \nlaid down by\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of G.L.\nBatra Versus State of Haryana and others, reported in 2013 (4) PLJR (SC)\n\n403.\n\n ::6:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS\n\n16. Shri Bindhyachal Rai, learned Additional Standing counsel appearing for\nthe respondents, in his turn would submit that all the applicants initially engaged\nas the casual labour in railways, conferred with the temporary status and\nthereafter absorbed on the regular post. The qualifying service for the pension\nwere reckoned 50% of service period after obtaining temporary status till date of\nthe regularization on regular post and 100% of services period reckoned after\ndate of regularization till date of superannuation. The qualifying service for\npension and pensionary benefits as stated hereinabove has been reckoned\naccordance with Rule 20, Note-1 of Rule 31 of Pension Rules 1993 and read with\nPara 20 of Master Circular No.54 and Para 1501, 2005, 2005(a) of the Indian\nRailway Establishment Manual-Volume-1. (in short IREM-I)\n\n17. Shri Bindhyachal Rai, learned Additional Standing Counsel for the\nrespondents vociferously canvassed that all the applicants have been correctly as\nper pension rules granted service benefits by reckoning 50% of service period\nafter obtaining temporary status casual labour and 100% after date of regular\nappointment till date of superannuation and the applicants do not have any vested\nlegal right and no any legal right accrued in their favour to claim 100% of\nservice period to be reckoned for temporary status period. The claim is contrary\nto statutory Pension Rules 1993.\n\n18. Shri Bindhyachal Rai, learned Additional Standing Counsel also\ncontended that Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus\nSarju\n (supra) given direction on special facts and same is judgment in personam,\nwhereas in case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) later\ndecision has laid down point of law in elaborate manner after considering all\nrelevant provisions applicable to applicants at the time of retirement for grant of\npension.\n\n19. Shri Bindhyachal Rai, learned Additional Standing Counsel appearing for\nthe respondents to buttress his submissions heavily placed reliance on judgments\ndated, 24.07.2017 in CWJC No.5111 of 2017, The Union of India & ors versus\nBinod Singh and Judgment dated 21.12.2017 in CWJC No. 12459 of 2017\ntitled the \nUnion of India and others versus Ramjee and others\n passed by\nHon'ble High Court, Patna modified orders of this Tribunal in similar cases and\nfollowed very recent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Union of\n ::7:: \nOA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nIndia and others versus Rakesh Kumar\n reported in (2017) 13 SCC 338: 2017\n(3) PLJR SC 83.\n\n20. Shri Bindhyachal Rai, learned Additional Standing Counsel also\nemphasized that Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Patna has followed law laid\ndown on the point of law by Hon'ble Supreme Court in recent case of \nUnion of\nIndia & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) and the said decisions of the\nHon'ble High Court at Patna are binding precedents on this Tribunal and\napplicants are entitled to reckon only 50% of service of temporary status till date\nof regularization for qualifying service and do not have any vested right to claim\n100% service period to be counted for temporary status period.\n\n21. We have bestowed our anxious considerations on the rival contentions of\nthe learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the material placed on\nrecord.\n\n22. The admitted facts are that all the applicants were engaged as causal\nlabourers in railways before year 1987, granted temporary status and regularized\non regular post of Trackman. The respondents have counted only 50% of the\nservice period after obtaining temporary status casual labour till date of\nregularization/absorption against the regular post and reckoned 100% of period\nof service from date of regularization till date of superannuation for purposes of\nqualifying service towards grant of pension and pensionary benefits. So also the\nrespondents not counted half period of casual service in railways before attaining\ntemporary status as qualifying service for pensionary benefits. Admittedly in\nidentical cases Union of India & Ors. Versus Binod Singh in CWJC No.\n5111/2017 decided on 24.07.2017 and Union of India & Ors. Versus Ramjee\n& Ors. decided on 21.12.2017. Hon'ble High Court of Patna has followed the\nrecent judgment in case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n\n(supra).\n\n23. The dispute in the present case is that applicants are claiming reckoning\ntowards qualifying service for pension and pensionary benefits 50% of the casual\nlabour period before obtaining temporary status and 100% counting of service\nrendered after obtaining temporary status casual labour till date of regularization\ninstead of 50% of their temporary status service period already counted by the\nrespondents for pensionary benefits. The claim of the applicants is based on\n ::8:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nsimilar treatment to count 100% of service for temporary status period based on\nlaws \nlaid down in\n case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Sarju\n (supra).\n \nWhereas\nHon'ble High Court of Patna has followed the recent decisions of Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra)\nharmonizing conflicting judgments to bring about uniformity in relation to grant\nof benefits of pension for casual temporary status employees in railway\nsubsequently regularized/absorbed on regular post.\n\n THE ISSUE\n\n24. From the above submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and\nmaterial on record, the issues which arise for consideration in the present O.A.\nare-\n\n 1. Whether the casual workers before obtaining the temporary\n status is also entitled to reckon 50% of casual services for the\n purpose of pensionary benefits?\n\n 2. Whether the entire service of a casual worker in railway\n after obtaining temporary status till their regular absorption\n on a post is entitled to be reckoned for pensionary benefit or\n only 50% period of such service can be reckoned for\n pensionary benefits ?\n\n THE RELEVANT RULES\n\n25. The Rules which are relevant to decide both the issues are extracted as\nunder:-\n\n(i) The Railway Services (Pension) Rules, 1993 (in short Pension Rules 1993) have been\n framed under proviso to \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India. The Rules which are\n relevant to decide the issue, are extracted for ready reference as below:-\n\n Rule 6. Regulation of claims to pension or family pension. - (1) Any claim to pension\n or family pension shall be regulated by the provisions of these rules in force at the time\n when a railway servant retires or is retired or is discharged or is allowed to resign from\n service or dies, as the case may be.\n\n (2) The day on which a railway servant retires or is retired or is discharged or is\n allowed to resign from service or dies as the case may be, shall be treated as his last\n working day.\"\n\n Rule 20. Commencement of qualifying service- Subject to the provisions of these\n rules, qualifying service of a railway servant shall commence from the date he takes\n charge of the post to which he is first appointed either substantively or in an officiating\n or temporary capacity:\n\n Provided that officiating or temporary service is followed, without interruption, by\n substantive appointment in the same or another service or post:\n\n Provided further that-\n\n (a) in the case of a railway servant in a Group 'D' service or post who held a\n lien or a suspended lien on a permanent pensionable post prior to the 17th\n ::9:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n April, 1950, service rendered before attaining the age of sixteen years shall not\n count for any purpose; and\n\n (b) in the case of a railway servant not covered by clause (a), service rendered\n before attaining the age of eighteen years shall not count, except for\n compensation gratuity (Authority: Railway Board's letter No. F(E)/99/PN\n (Modification) dated 23.5.2000)\n\n (c) the provisions of clause (b) shall not be applicable in the cases of counting\n of military service for civil pension under rule 34. (Authority: Railway Board's\n letter No. F(E)11/2004/PN1/21(Amendment) dated 7.12.2004)\n\n(ii) Rule 31 \"Counting of service paid from Contingencies- In\n respect of a railway servant, in service on or after the 22nd day of\n August, 1968, half the service paid from contingencies shall be taken\n into account for calculating pensionary benefits on absorption in\n regular employment, subject to the following condition namely: -\n\n the service paid from contingencies has been in a job involving\n wholetime employment;\n\n the service paid from contingencies should be in a type of work\n or job for which regular posts could have been sanctioned such as posts\n of malis, chowkidars and khalasis;\n\n the service should have been such for which payment has\n been made either on monthly rate basis or on daily rates computed and\n paid on a monthly basis and which, though not analogous to the\n regular scales of pay, borne some relation in the matter of pay to those\n being paid for similar jobs being performed at the relevant period by\n staff in regular establishments;\n\n (b) the service paid from contingencies has been\n continuous and followed by absorption in regular employment without\n a break;\n\n Provided that the weightage for past service paid from\n contingencies shall be limited to the period after 1st January, 1961\n subject to the condition that authentic records of service such as pay\n bill, leave record or service-book is available.\n\n NOTE - (1) the provisions of this rule shall also apply to\n casual labour paid from contingencies.\n\n (2) The expression \"absorption in regular employment\" means\n absorption against a regular post.\"\n\n(iii) Para 20 of the Master Circular No. 54 is quoted as below:-\n\n \"20. Counting of the period of service of Casual Labour for pensionary\n benefits: - Half of the period of service of casual labour (other than casual\n labour employed on Projects) after attainment of temporary status on\n completion of 120 days continuous service if it is followed by absorption in\n service as regular railway employee, counts for pensionary benefits. With effect\n from 1-1-1981, the benefit has also been extended to Project Casual Labour.\"\n\n(iv) The Para 2005 of IREM-Vol-I reads as-\n\n The Next Provision need to be noted is Para 2005 of IREM, which is as\n follows:-\n\n 2005. Entitlements and privileges admissible to Casual Labour who\n are treated as temporary (i.e. given temporary status) after the\n completion of 120 day or 360 days of continuous employment (as the\n case may be).\n\n (a) Casual labour treated as temporary are entitled to the rights and\n benefits admissible to temporary railway servants as \nlaid down in\n\n Chapter XXIII of this Manual. The rights and privileges admissible\n to such labour also include the benefit of D & A rules. However, their\n service prior to absorption in temporary/ permanent/ regular cadre\n after the required selection/ screening will not count for the purpose\n of seniority vis-a-vis other regular/ temporary employees. This is\n however, subject to the provisions that if the seniority of certain\n ::10:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n individual employees has already been determined in any other\n manner, either in pursuance of judicial decisions of otherwise, the\n seniority so determined shall not be altered.\n\n Casual labour including Project casual labour shall be\n eligible to count only half the period of service rendered by them after\n attaining temporary status on completion of prescribed days of\n continuous employment and before regular absorption, as qualifying\n service for the purpose of pensionary benefits. This benefit will be\n admissible only after their absorption in regular employment. Such\n casual labour, who have attained temporary status, will also be\n entitled to carry forward the leave at their credit to new post on\n absorption in regular service. Daily rated casual labour will not be\n entitled to these benefits.\n\n (iv) 1501 of Chapter-XV of IREM-I (i) Temporary Railway Servants\n Definition--A \"temporary railway servant\" means a railway servant without a\n lien on a permanent post on a Railway or any other administration or office\n under the Railway Board. The term does not include \"casual labour\",\n including 'casual labour with temporary status', a \"contract\" or \"part-time\"\n\n employee or an \"apprentice\".\n\n (v) 24. So far as reckoning period of service in case of railway employees for\n pensionary benefits. The issue is no more res-integra. The Hon'ble Supreme\n Court in case of Union of India Versus Rakesh Kumar, reported in 2017\n (13) SCC 388: AIR 2017 Supreme Court 1691 was seisin with only issue\n \"whether the entire service of a casual worker after obtaining temporary status\n till his regular absorption on a post is entitled to be reckoned for pensionary\n benefit or only 50 percent period of such service can be reckoned for\n pensionary benefit?\" \nIn case of \nRakesh Kumar\n (supra) the respondents-\n employees from railway were initially appointed as casual labor in Northern\n Railway after working and were granted temporary status and subsequently\n regularized against posts. The Hon'ble Supreme Court examined scheme of\n Rules, 1993, Para 2005 of IREM. The Hon'ble Apex Court in Para 55 held that\n casual worker after obtaining temporary status is entitled to reckon 50% of his\n services till he is regularized on a regular/temporary post for purpose of\n calculation of pension. So also casual worker before obtaining the temporary\n status is also entitled to reckon 50% of casual service for purposes of pension.\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\n\n26. We have extracted herein above the relevant rules framed under the\nproviso to the \nArticle 309\n of the Constitution of India. The applicants were\ninitially engaged as causal labour in railway prior to1987, granted temporary\nstatus and regularized on the regular post of Trackmen under Senior S.E. (P-\nWay), ECR, Mokama and superannuated on 30.04.2012, 31.03.2005 and\n31.03.2005 respectively.\n\n27. We are of the view that right to pension accrued in favour of the applicants\non superannuation in accordance with the statutory Pension Rules 1993 and, the\nRailway Board Circulars having statutory force extracted herein above sub-\nservient to Pension Rules 1993. The applicants have vested legal right to count\nperiod of qualifying service and same has accrued accordance with statutory\nrules. We are examining the relevant rules to resolve the controversy related to\n ::11:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nreckoning period of service to be counted as qualifying for the purposes of\ncalculation of pension for the applicants in the case on hand.\n\n28. Rule 20 of Pension Rules 1993 stipulates that qualifying service shall\ncommence from the date the employees takes charge of the post to which he is\ninitially appointed either substantively or in an officiating or temporary capacity.\nRule 20 of Pension Rules 1993 in clear as noon day that same is applicable when\nan employee is appointed against the post in substantive capacity or in an\nofficiating or temporary capacity. It is also clear from the plain reading of Rule\n20 that it is attracted only when employee is appointed against any post. The\nproviso to Rule 20 reads as \"Provided that officiating or temporary service is\nfollowed, without interruption, by substantive appointment in the same or\nanother service or post.\" The plain reading of the proviso appended to Rule 20\non Pension Rules 1993 makes it clear to count commencement of qualifying\nservice from the date of employee takes charge of the post for qualifying service\nto be reckoned, the employee must be appointed on the regular post and not\notherwise. The combined reading of the first proviso to Rule 20 and Rule 20 of\nPension Rules 1993 make it abundantly clear that merely grant of temporary\nstatus to casual labours employees will not be entitled to count their services of\ntemporary status for pensionary purposes but employee also to be appointed on\nthe regular post/absorbed on regularization, than only the railway employees\nentitled to count their services of date of taking charge and condition precedent\nto be regularized on same or any regular post than for qualifying service will be\ncounted from date of taking charge.\n\n29. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nGeneral Manager, North West\nRailway and others versus Chanda Devi\n, reported in (2008) 2 SCC 108 in\nparagraph no. 29 observed as under:-\n\n \"29. In absence of any statutory rules framed, executive instructions can be\n issued in relation to the matter governed by the constitutional provisions.\n In Khem Chand [AIR 1958 SC 300] this Court had noticed the relevant\n constitutional provisions and opined that the Railway Manual was an amalgam\n of various circulars issued from time to time. Such executive instructions or\n rules framed would be statutory in nature.\"\n\n30. Rule 31 of Pension Rule 1993 prescribes for counting of service paid from\ncontingencies in respect of a railway servant in service on or after 22.08.1968,\nhalf the service paid from contingencies shall be taken into account for\n ::12:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\ncalculating pensionary benefits on absorption in regular employment. The Note-\nI of Rule 31 of Pension Rules 1993 specifically expressly provided intention to\ncount half of the services rendered as casual labour before obtaining the status\nof temporary casual labour. We can safely conclude that all the applicants have\nvested legal right accrued at the time of superannuation to reckon 50% of service\nperiod as casual labour before obtaining temporary status.\n\n31. The issue no.1 so far relates to reckoning of 50% casual period before\nobtaining the temporary status for purposes of pension to be in accordance with\nNote 1 of Rule 31 of Pension Rules 1993 and we hold that applicants are entitled\nto count for 50% casual period before attaining temporary status and said benefits\nhas been illegally denied and has not been extended to these applicants.\n\n32. We have considered the matter and already analyzed in detail related to\nthe issue no. 1 related to reckoning 50% casual service before obtaining\ntemporary status for purpose of qualifying service for grant of pension in light of\nNote 1 of Rule 31 of Pension Rules 1993. Accordingly we decide the issue no.1\nin favour of the applicants and applicants are entitled to reckon 50% of their\nservices as casual labour before obtaining the temporary status for the purpose of\nre-calculation of retiral benefits payable to the applicants and respondents are\ndirected to verify and extend benefits of said 50% services of casual period, if\nalready not have been extended to the applicants.\n\n33. Now coming as to the next issue, issue no.2, \"whether entire, 100%\nservice of a casual worker in railway after obtaining temporary status till their\nregular absorption on a post entitled to reckon for pensionary benefits or only\n50% period of such service can be reckoned accordance with rules?\"\n\n34. We have already extracted relevant rules to resolve the controversy. Rule\n20 of the Pension Rules, 1993 provides to count qualifying service for pension\npurpose from the date these applicants appointed in temporary capacity with\ncondition precedent that employee should be absorbed on substantive\nappointment and there should be no interruption in the services. Further the sub-\npara (a) of Para 2005 of IREM-Vol. I, recognizes to count half of the services\nrendered as temporary status casual labour before regular absorption. Thus\nbefore being regularized as per sub-para (a) of para 2005 of IREM-Vol. I,\napplicants are entitled to reckon 50% of service period as temporary status.\n\n ::13:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nThereafter as per Rule 20 of Pension Rules, 1931 once these applicants acquired\nstatus of temporary railway employee as defined in para 1501 of the IREM-Vol.\nI, thereafter on regularization on regular post of Trackmen, the vested legal right\naccrues for counting of 100% service till date of superannuation. So far as\nservice period from date of attaining temporary status casual labour till regular\nabsorption on substantive appointment as per rules i.e. Para 1501 of IREM,\napplicants held status of purely temporary casual labour and they were not\ntemporary railway employee so only entitled for reckoning 50% of service\nrendered after obtaining temporary status casual labour. Thus no legal right\naccrued in favour of applicants of this O.A. as on date of superannuation\naccordance with statutory rules for railway employees to reckon 100% of service\nrendered after obtaining temporary status till date of regularization as their\nstatus till date of regularization as their status in railways was of temporary\ncasual labour and not of temporary railway employees. The next provision to be\nnoted is Para 2005 of IREM-I also provides for same scheme for counting the\nperiod for pensionary benefits. The sub-para (a) of Para 2005 of IREM-I\nprovides-\n\n \" 2005(a)........Casual labour including project labour shall be eligible to\n count only half the period of service rendered by them after attaining\n temporary status on completion of prescribed days of continuous employment\n and before regular absorption as qualifying service for the purpose of\n poensionary benefits.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n The Para 20 of Master Circular No. 54 for ready reference reiterated as:-\n\n \"20. Counting of the period of service of Casual Labour for pensionary\n benefits: - Half of the period of service of casual labour (other than casual\n labour employed on Projects) after attainment of temporary status on\n completion of 120 days continuous service if it is followed by absorption in\n service as regular railway employee, counts for pensionary benefits. With\n effect from 1-1-1981, the benefit has also been extended to Project Casual\n Labour.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n35. The perusal of Para 20 of the Master Circular No. 54 already extracted\nhereinabove indicates that only half of the period of service of a casual labour\nafter attainment of temporary status if it is followed by absorption in service as a\nregular railway employees, counts for pensionary benefits.\n\n36. We have analysed entire relevant rules applicable to carve out legal\nentitlement of applicants so far relates to issue no.2 and we are of the view that\nthe applicants are entitled to reckon 50% of his services after obtaining temporary\n ::14:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nstatus till they were regularized on a regular/temporary post of Trackmen for the\npurpose of calculation of pension and pensionary benefits in the light of Rule 20,\n31 of Pension Rules read with Para 20 of the Master Circular No.54 and Para\n2005 and sub-para (a) of Para 2005 of IREM-I. Accordingly, we decide the issue\nno.2, against all the applicants and we hold that no vested right accrued in the\nfavour of the applicants to reckon 100% of casual worker service period after\nobtaining temporary status till all of them were regularized on a regular post of\nTrackmen instead applicants have been correctly granted as per rules benefits of\nreckoning period 50%of their services after obtaining temporary status till they\nare regularized.

The\nHon'ble High Court of Patna, their Lordships have followed the recent\njudgment of Hon'ble Apex Court and we are bound by judgments of our own\nHon'ble High Court of the State.\n\n37. Now reversing back to the gist of the contentions of Mr. M.P. Dixit,\nlearned counsel for the applicants, criticizing the inaction of respondents not\ncounting 100% of period of service of casual worker after obtaining temporary\nstatus till date of regularization instead respondents reckoned 50% of temporary\nstatus casual labour services for the pension. The claim of applicants based on\norder dated 30.09.2011 passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nUnion of\nIndia & ors versus Sarju\n (supra) and on similar lines orders passed by this\nTribunal.\n\n38. Shri Bindhyachal Rai, learned Additional Standing Counsel appearing for\nall the respondents would submit that applicants have been correctly granted\nbenefits of counting 50% of services period of temporary status for pensionary\nbenefits accordance with statutory rules and they have no vested legal right, no\nlegal right accrued. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in recent judgment of \nUnion of\nIndia & Ors.

Shri Bindhyachal Rai\n ::15:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nvociferously canvassed that applicants are entitled for 50% of service period after\nobtaining temporary status and the relevant rules not permit to extend benefits to\ncount 100% service as temporary status casual worker before date of\nregularization.\n\n39. Much emphasis has been placed by Mr. M.P.

Rule 20 provides that qualifying service shall\n commence from the date the employee takes\n charge of the post to which he is first appointed\n either substantively or in an officiating or\n temporary capacity. Rule 20 is attracted when a\n person is appointed to the post in any of the above\n capacities. Rule 20 has no application when\n appointment is not against any post. When a casual\n labour is granted a temporary status, grant of a\n status confers various privileges as enumerated in\n para 2005 of IREM. One of the benefits\n enumerated in para 2005 sub clause(a) is also to\n make him eligible to count only half of the services\n rendered by him after attaining temporary status.\n\n Rule 20 is thus clearly not attracted in a case\n where only a temporary status is granted to casual\n worker and no appointment is made in any\n capacity against any post. The Delhi High Court\n in the impugned judgment relies on proviso to Rule\n 20 for coming to the conclusion in para 7 of the\n judgment.\n\n ::20:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n \"7.

Since Rule 20 does not deal with\n what is to be done with the period of\n service spent as casual labourer, para 20\n of the Master Circular 54 and para 2005\n of the IREM address the said issue. Being\n administrative instructions, they clarify\n that half the period spent as casual\n labourers would be eligible to be reckoned\n for purposes of pension.\"\n\n 42. The above Proviso has to be read along with\n the main Rule 20, when main Rule 20 contemplates\n commencement of qualifying service from the date\n he takes charge of the post, the appointment to a\n post is implicit and a condition precedent. The\n proviso put another different condition that\n officiating or temporary service is followed,\n without interruption, by substantive appointment\n in the same or another service or post. The proviso\n cannot be read independent to the main provision\n nor it can mean that by only grant of temporary\n status a casual employee is entitled to reckon his\n service of temporary status for purpose of\n pensionary benefit.\n\n \n43. The Delhi High Court in impugned judgment\n has not relied the subsequent judgment of Andhra\n Pradesh High Court in A.Ramanamma dated\n 01.05.2009 and did not follow the judgment of this\n court in \nChanda Devi\n case (Supra) on the ground\n that Rule 20 specifically the proviso has not been\n considered.\n \nThis Court in \nChanda Devi\n's case did\n not refer to Rule 20 since Rule 20 had no\n application in the facts of that case because the\n appointment of husband of respondent in \nChanda\n Devi\n's case was not against any post.\n \nRule 20\n being not applicable non-reference of Rule 20 by\n this Court in \nChanda Devi\n's case is\n inconsequential.\n \nIn para 8 of the impugned\n judgment, the Delhi High Court for not relying on\n \nA.Ramanamma and Chanda Devi\n case gave\n following reasons:\n\n \"8. In the opinion of this Court,\n the subsequent ruling of the Andhra\n Pradesh High Court in\n Ramanamma(supra), with respect, does\n not declare the correct law. Though the\n judgment has considered certain previous\n rulings as well as the provisions of the\n IREM and Rule 31 of the Railway\n Services(Pension) Rules, the notice of the\n Court was not apparently drawn in that\n case and the Court did not take into\n account Rule 20, especially the proviso\n ::21:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n which specifically deals with the situation\n at hand. \nLikewise, Chanda Devi\n(supra)\n did not consider the effect of Rule 20,\n which, in the opinion of this Court, entitles\n those who work as casual labourers; are\n granted temporary status, and; eventually\n appointed substantively to the Railways, to\n reckon the entire period of temporary and\n substantive appointment for the purposes\n of pension.\"\n\n \n44. The judgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court\n in A.Ramanamma case had considered in detail\n the judgment of this Court in \nChanda Devi\n's case\n as well as Para 20 of Master Circular and para\n 2005 of IREM and has also considered other case\n of this Court and has rightly come to the\n conclusion that casual labour after obtaining\n temporary status is entitled to reckon only half of\n the period.\n It may, however, be noticed that in A.\n Ramanamma case the Andhra High Court has\n also held that 50% of service as casual labour\n cannot be counted, which is not correct. Rule 31 of\n Rules, 1993 provides for counting of service paid\n from contingencies. Note 1 of Rule 31 provides:-\n\n \" The provisions of this Rule shall also\n apply to casual labour paid from\n contingencies when Note 1 expressly\n makes applicable Rule 31 to the casual\n labour they are also entitled to reckon half\n of casual services paid from\n contingencies.\"\n\n 45. Thus except to the above extent, the judgment\n of Andhra Pradesh High Court in A. Ramanamma\n case lays down the correct law.\n\n 46. As observed above, the grant of temporary\n status of casual labour is not akin to appointment\n against a post and such contingency is not covered\n by Rule 20 and the same is expressly covered by\n Rule 31 which provides for \"half the service paid\n from contingencies shall be taken into account for\n calculating pensionary benefits on absorption in\n regular employment subject to certain conditions\n enumerated there in.\" Thus Rule 31 is clearly\n applicable while computing the eligible services\n for calculating pensionary benefits on granting of\n temporary status.\n\n 48. We, however, are of the view that the period of\n casual labour prior to grant of temporary status by\n virtue of Note-1 Rule 31 has to be counted to the\n extent of 50% for pensionary benefits.\n\n 55. In view of foregoing discussion, we hold :\n\n i) the casual worker after obtaining\n temporary status is entitled to reckon 50% of his\n services till he is regularised on a\n regular/temporary post for the purposes of\n calculation of pension.\n\n ii)the casual worker before obtaining the\n temporary status is also entitled to reckon 50% of\n casual service for purposes of pension.\n\n iii) Those casual workers who are\n appointed to any post either substantively or in\n officiating or in temporary capacity are entitled to\n ::22:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n reckon the entire period from date of taking charge\n to such post as per Rule 20 of Rules, 1993.\n\n iv) It is open to Pension Sanctioning\n Authority to recommend for relaxation in\n deserving case to the Railway Board for\n dispensing with or relaxing requirement of any\n rule with regard to those casual workers who have\n been subsequently absorbed against the post and\n do not fulfill the requirement of existing rule for\n grant of pension, in deserving cases. On a request\n made in writing, the Pension Sanctioning\n Authority shall consider as to whether any\n particular case deserves to be considered for\n recommendation for relaxation under Rule 107 of\n Rules, 1993.\n\n 56. In result, all the appeals are allowed. The\n impugned judgments of Delhi High Court are set\n aside. The writ petitions filed by the appellants are\n allowed, the judgments of Central Administrative\n Tribunal are set aside and the Original\n Applications filed by the respondents are disposed\n of in terms of what we have held in para 55 as\n above.\n\n [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n41.

The Hon'ble High Court, Patna Their Lordships have followed the recent\njudgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nUnion of India Versus Binod\nSingh\n (supra) vide judgment dated 24.07.2017 reads as:-\n\n \"Heard learned Senior counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for the\n private respondent.\n\n The decision of the Central Administrative Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as\n the \"Tribunal\"), Patna Bench, Patna dated 4th October, 2016 is subject matter of\n challenge before this Court. It is the direction issued in paragraph 10 of the said order,\n which is the bone of contention, which reads as under:\n\n \"10. Accordingly, the OA is allowed. The respondents are directed to count\n 100% period rendered under Temporary Status from 01.01.1981 and 50% service\n ::23:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\nrendered as casual labourer from 01.12.1972 along with the 100% period after\nregularization till the date of superannuation and thereafter to revise the entire\npensionary benefits and make payment of arrears thereof with interest @ 8% p.a. with\nall consequential benefits within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a\ncopy of this order. However, there shall be no order as to costs.\"\n\n \nThe learned Senior counsel representing the Railways submits that in view of a\nvery recent decision of Hon'ble Apex Court rendered in the case of \nUnion of India Vs.\nRakesh Kumar\n since reported in 2017 (3) PLJR SC 83; the very gamut of the dispute\nas well as judgments of conflicting kind passed from time to time was considered by the\nDivision Bench in detail. The Court has explained those decisions and to harmonize\nand bring about uniformity in relation to grant of benefit of pension for casual or\ntemporary status employees working in the Railway, by crystallizing its view in\nconcluding part of \nthe said decision\n. The ratio of \nthe said decision\n of the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt is reproduced hereinbelow:-\n\n \"55. In view of foregoing discussion, we hold:\n\n (i) the casual worker after obtaining temporary status is entitled to\n reckon 50% of his services till he is regularized on a\n regular/temporary post for the purposes of calculation of pension.\n\n (ii) the casual worker before obtaining the temporary status is also\n entitled to reckon 50% of casual service for purposes of pension.\n\n (iii) those casual workers who are appointed to any post either\n substantively or in officiating or in temporary capacity are entitled to\n reckon the entire period from date of taking charge to such post as\n per Rule 20 of Rules, 1993.\n\n (iv) It is open to Pension Sanctioning Authority to recommend for\n relaxation in deserving case to the Railway Board for dispensing with\n or relaxing requirement of any rule with regard to those casual\n workers who have been subsequently absorbed against the post and do\n not fulfill the requirement of existing rule for grant of pension, in\n deserving cases. On a request made in writing, the Pension\n Sanctioning Authority shall consider as to whether any particular case\n deserves to be considered for recommendation for relaxation under\n Rule 107 of Rules, 1993.\"\n\n If this is what has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decision\nrendered on 24.03.2017 with regard to the calculation or reckoning of period of\ncasual as well as temporary status employees, which has been fixed at 50% for casual\nand 50% for temporary status, the order of the Tribunal seems to be contrary to the\nabove legal view. Therefore, to harmonize and to further rule out further confusion\nwhich the Tribunal may commit in passing further orders in similar dispute, the\nimpugned order dated 4th October, 2016 passed in O.A. No. 645/2015 is set aside.\nThe benefit of pension for the casual period and temporary status will be calculated\non 50/50 basis and pension will accrue accordingly.\n\n The stand of the counsel for the private respondent is that even in the latest\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, not all decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court,\nhas been taken into consideration nor was the circular of the Railway Board taken into\nconsideration.\n\n \nSuch a submission is required to be rejected on perusal of the order of the\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of \nUnion of India Vs. Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) because\nthe effort of the Hon'ble Apex Court is to harmonize diverse opinions which has been\nvexing the courts, the time has come when the harmony sought to be restored by the\nHon'ble Apex Court be implemented.\n\n The impugned order dated 04.10.2016 passed in O.A. No. 645/2015 is set\naside and the writ application stands allowed.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n ::24:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n43. The Hon'ble High Court, Patna, Their Lordships have taken a similar\nview vide judgment dated 21.12.2017 in case titled \nUnion of India and ors\nversus Ramjee & Ors\n (supra) observing as under:-\n\n \"Nobody appears on behalf of the private-respondent.\n Heard learned senior counsel representing the Railways. Perused the order,\n dated 29.03.2017, passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Patna Bench, Patna\n in O. P. No. 740 of 2016.\n\n The Tribunal obviously seems to have erred in directing the respondents to\n account 100 per cent period rendered in temporary status from 01.01.1981 and 50 per\n cent service rendered as casual labourer from 01.12.1972 along with the 100 per cent\n period after regularization till the date of superannuation for calculation of arrears\n and payments with interest of 8 per cent.\n\n \nThe Court, keeping in mind the decision rendered in the case of \nUnion of\n India Vs. Rakesh Kumar\n, reported in 2017 (3) PLJR SC 83 sets aside the impugned\n order with a modification that the calculation will be required to be done in terms of\n what the Apex Court has \nlaid down in\n paragraph 55 of the said judgement, which\n reads as under:\n\n \"55. In view of forgoing discussion, we hold:\n\n (i) the casual worker after obtaining temporary status is entitled to\n reckon 50 % of his services till he is regularized on a regular / temporary post\n for the purposes of calculation of pension.\n\n (ii) the casual worker before obtaining the temporary status is also\n entitled to reckon 50 % of casual service for purposes of pension.\n\n (iii) those casual workers who are appointed to any post either\n substantively or Patna High Court CWJC No.12459 of 2017 dt.21-12-2017\n 3/3 in officiating or in temporary capacity are entitled to reckon the entire\n period from date of taking charge to such post as per Rule 20 of Rules, 1993.\n\n (iv) It is open to Pension Sanctioning Authority to recommend for\n relaxation in deserving case to the Railway Board for dispensing with or\n relaxing requirement of any rule with regard to those casual workers who\n have been subsequently absorbed against the post and do not fulfill the\n requirement of existing rule for grant of pension, in deserving cases. On a\n request made in wring, the Pension Sanctioning Authority shall consider as\n to whether any particular case deserves to be considered for recommendation\n for relaxation under Rule 107 of Rules, 1993.\"\n\n The Writ Application stands allowed in terms of above.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n44. Bare perusal of judgements extracted hereinabove passed by their\nLordships of our own High Court, Patna, binding on this Tribunal. Their\nLordships were in seisin with identical issues in similar facts, whereby this\nTribunal in Original applicants issued direction on to count 100% period rendered\nunder temporary status before date of regularization and to count 50% service\nrendered as Casual labourer before attaining temporary status with consequential\nbenefits. Their Lordships have observed in above cases of Binod Singh and\nRamjee (supra) extracted hereinabove that the orders of this Tribunal seems to\nbe contrary to the recent legal view in case of \nUnion of India vs Rakesh Kumar\n\n ::25:: \nOA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n(supra) with regard to the reckoning of period of casual as well as temporary\nemployees as to 50% for casual period and 50% for temporary status period.\n\nTheir Lordships in above cited cases set-aside orders of this Tribunal in similar\ndispute with modification in terms of paragraph 55 of the judgement in case of\n\nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra).\n\n45. \nIn view, whereof, we hold that both the issues are no more res-integra and\nsquarely covered by recent and the elaborate judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) and as\nanalysed in preceeding paras by us that our own Hon'ble High Court, Patna and\ntheir Lordships have followed ratio laid by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\n\nUnion of India & Ors. Versus Rakesh Kumar\n (supra) and this Tribunal is\nbound by the decisions of our own Hon'ble High Court, Patna. Therefore, the\nsubmissions advanced on the issue so far as to reckon 100% of service period\nafter obtaining temporary status instead of 50% before date of regularization by\nShri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel for the applicants, is hereby repelled.\n\n46. Shri M.P. Dixit, learned counsel for the applicants has placed reliance on\nthe judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of \nG.L. Batra versus State of\nHaryana & Ors.\n (supra). We have carefully gone through the above cited\njudgement.\n\n47. But it is settled position of law that judgment has got no universal\napplication rather the judgment is to be tested on the basis of fact of each case.\nReference in this regard be made to the judgment rendered of Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in the case of \nDr. Subramanian Swamy versus State of Tamil Nadu and\nothers\n, (2014) 5 SCC75. The relevant paragraph 47 which reads as under--\n\n \"47. It is a settled legal proposition that the ratio of any decision must be understood\n in the background of the facts of that case and the case is only an authority for what it\n actually decides, and not what logically follows from it. \"The Court should not-place\n reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the\n fact Situation of the decision on which reliance is placed.\"\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n48. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Nair Service Society vs Dr. T.Beer\nMasthan in (2009) 5 SCC 545. Relevant para 48 reads as:-\n\n \"48. Several decisions have been cited before us by the respondents, but it is well\n established that judgments in service jurisprudence should be understood with\n reference to the particular service rules in the State governing that field.\"\n\n ::26:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n49. We are now proceeding to examine the factual aspects as was in the case\nof \nG.L. Batra\n (supra) and found that issue was related to \"whether state\ngovernment is competent to vary the remuneration fixed to a constitutional\nappointee to his disadvantage, after his appointment?\" Mr. G.L. Batra worked as\nsenior most Addl. Secretary in the Lok-Saha and later on joined as member.\nHaryana Public Service Commission. The issue related to re-fixation of\nremuneration as per \nRegulation 6\n of the 1972.\n The learned single Bench of\nHon'ble High Court in Ram Phal Singh (supra) related to member, H.P.S.C held\nin favour of member H.P.S.C and the Division Bench of Hon'ble High Court\nPunjab & Haryana placing reliance on Ram Phal Singh case (supra), rendered\nin M.P. Pandove (supra) again so which the SLP before Hon'ble Apex Court\nwas dismissed. The above facts were brought to knowledge of D.B. of Hon'ble\nHigh Court of the Punjab and Haryana but the Division Bench overruled the\njudgement in Ram Phal Singh's case (supra). The Hon'ble Supreme court in\nsuch circumstances held in para 13 and 15 that High Court could not overrule\njudgement of single bench which was affirmed by an another co-ordinate Bench\nand should have referred the matter to a larger bench and when an earlier decision\nmay seem to be incorrect to a Bench but yet it will have the binding effect on the\nlater Bench of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\n50. But here in the case on hand we have analysed in detail the statutory\nscheme for grant of pension and reckoning qualifying service to grant benefit of\npension for casual or temporary status employees working in the Railway. The\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the recent judgement in elaborate manner harmonized\nthe diverse opinions and our own Hon'ble High Court Patna, their Lordship\nfollowed the ratio laid down in recent case of \nUnion of India & Ors. Versus\nRakesh Kumar\n (supra) binding on this Tribunal.\n \nTherefore with great respect\nthe judgement rendered in case of \nG.L. Batra\n (supra) relied by learned counsel\nfor the applicants in our opinion, not applicable in the facts and circumstances of\npresent case on hand.\n\n ::27:: OA 708/2016/CAT/PATNA BENCH\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n51. We have already analysed in detail the issue in light of aforesaid analysis.\nAccordingly, our finding on issue no.1 is decided in favour of the applicants. We\nhold that the period of casual labour prior to grant of temporary status in light of\nNote 1 of Rule 31 of pension Rules 1993 all the applicants are entitled and\nrespondents are directed to verify and re-calculate, count to the extent of 50% for\nrevised pension and other retiral benefits and along with arrears within three\nmonths from the date of receipt of the certified copy of the order passed today\nfailing which the interest shall be paid at the rate of 9% from the date of their\nentitlement till final payment.\n\n52. Our findings so far as on issue no.2, we hold that to reckon 50% of service\nperiod after obtaining temporary status till date of regularization and is correct\nand in accordance with rules and all the applicants are not entitled to reckon of\n100% temporary status period till their regularization/absorption on regular post.\nAccordingly, we decide issue no.2 against all the applicants.\n\n53. Resultantly, the original application is partly allowed and disposed of to\nthe extent indicated herein above.\n\n54. There shall be no order as to costs.\n\n55. As a sequel thereof, pending miscellaneous application(s), if any, shall\nalso stands disposed of.\n\n Sd/- Sd/-\n (Ajay Pratap Singh) (Sunil Kumar Sinha)\n Judicial Member Administrative Member\n\nbp/-",
