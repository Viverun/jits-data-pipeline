The said Sanction Letter was\n\n signed by the Respondents. Pursuant to the said sanction,\n\n Respondent No.1 and the Applicant executed WCDL Agreement dated\n\n 17th May 2017, which was renewed from time to time. Respondent\n\n Nos.2 and 3 furnished personal guarantees in terms of the WCDL\n\n facility.\n\n c) Thereafter, a consortium arrangement was formed for loans\n\n extended to Respondent No.1 by lenders by executing a Working\n\n Page 2 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n Capital Consortium Agreement dated 31 st August 2017 (\"the\n\n Consortium Agreement\"). The Consortium Agreement was executed\n\n between Union Bank of India (lead bank), Cosmos Co-operative Bank\n\n Ltd., Axis Bank Ltd., Indian Bank and PNB Investment Services Ltd.\n\n was appointed as the Trustee.\n\n d) The sanctioned limits for the WCDL were modified from time to\n\n time. Thereafter, the Respondents issued a letter dated 29 th January\n\n 2018 to the Applicant stating that all the terms and conditions in the\n\n WCDL Agreement would be binding on all of them despite such\n\n modification in limits. By a Deed of Accession dated 23 rd February\n\n 2018, the Applicant was inducted into the Consortium Agreement.\n\n e) A Supplemental Inter Se Agreement dated 30 th May 2018 was\n\n executed between the Applicant and other lenders to the Consortium\n\n Agreement setting out the inter se rights between the lenders\n\n including the Applicant.\n\n f) Thereafter, the sanctioned limits of the WCDL were modified\n\n and a renewed WCDL Agreement dated 2 nd August 2018 was entered\n\n into between the Applicant and Respondent No.1. Respondent Nos.2\n\n Page 3 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n and 3 executed Personal Guarantees in respect of the same, which\n\n were continuing guarantees and provided liberty to the Applicant to\n\n proceed independently against Respondent Nos.2 and 3.\n\n g) Indian Bank issued a \"no dues\" letter to the consortium and\n\n exited the Consortium Agreement. Resultantly, a new Deed of\n\n Accession dated 19th November 2018 was entered into between the\n\n lenders including the Applicant.\n\n h) A letter dated 16th August 2019 was addressed by Respondent\n\n No.1 to the Applicant requesting grant of onetime ad-hoc facility of\n\n Rs.5,60,00,000/-, over and above the existing facility in respect of\n\n which the Loan Agreement existed. The Respondents confirmed that\n\n the new loan would be governed by the terms and conditions in the\n\n WCDL Agreement and the guarantees issued by Respondent Nos.2\n\n and 3 would also cover the new loan.\n\n i) The Applicant issued a letter dated 19 th August 2019 sanctioning\n\n the one-time temporary Limit Finance for Rs.5,60,00,000/-. The\n\n said Sanction Letter was unconditionally signed by all the\n\n Respondents. Under the terms of the said Sanction Letter, the said\n\n Page 4 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n loan amount was to be repaid within 90 days from the date of\n\n disbursement i.e. on or before 19th November 2019. Clause (k) of the\n\n said Sanction Letter contained an Arbitration Agreement between the\n\n parties and reads as follows:\n\n \"(k) All disputes, differences or claims arising out of these presents or as\n to the construction, meaning or effect thereof or as to the rights and liabilities of\n the parties hereunder shall be settled by arbitration to be held in Mumbai in\n accordance with the provisions of the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n or\n any statutory amendments thereof or any statute enacted for replacement\n thereof and shall be referred to the sole arbitration of a person to be appointed\n by us. In the event of death, refusal, neglect, inability or incapability of the\n person appointed to act as arbitrator, we may appoint another arbitrator. The\n award including interim award/s of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on\n all parties concerned. The arbitrator may lay down from time to time the\n procedure to be followed by him in conducting arbitration proceedings in such\n manner, as he considers appropriate.\"\n\n j) On 21st August 2019, the disbursement under the said facility was\n\n made by the Applicant to Respondent No.1.\n\n k) The Applicant addressed an email dated 12 th February 2020 to\n\n Respondent No.3 calling upon him to make payments of all the due\n\n and overdue amounts urgently.\n\n l) As no response was received from any of the Respondents, the\n\n Applicant, through its Advocate's letter dated 17 th March 2020,\n\n addressed to all the Respondents recalled all loan facilities extended\n\n to the Respondents, including the one-time temporary limit facility,\n\n Page 5 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n and called upon them to jointly and severally pay Rs.37,61,45,284/-\n\n with interest which was due as on 4 th February 2020. On 23 rd May\n\n 2020, a Notice under \nSection 13(2)\n of the Securitization and\n\n Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security\n\n Interest Act, 2002 (\"\nSARFAESI Act\n\") was issued by the Applicant to\n\n the Respondent. On 20th July 2020, a reply was sent by the\n\n Respondents to the Applicant denying that its account was a non-\n\n performing asset.\n\n m) On 22nd September 2020, the Applicant filed Commercial\n\n Summary Suit (O.S.No.87 of 2022) in this Court for an amount of\n\n Rs.36,10,74,412.84. Further, on 7th December 2020, the consortium\n\n filed an Application under \nSection 14\n of the SARFAESI Act.\n\n n) The Applicant filed a Petition, being Commercial Arbitration\n\n Petition (L) No.3628 of 2020, under \nSection 9\n of the Act for securing\n\n Rs.6,70,35,020.95 payable by the Respondents under the One-Time\n\n Temporary Limit Facility before this Court. By an Order dated 12 th\n\n March 2021, this Court granted interim reliefs in favour of the\n\n Applicant whereby the Respondents were directed to deposit a sum of\n\n Rs.5,60,00,000/- and additionally were also directed to disclose their\n\n Page 6 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n assets. Further, Respondent No.1 was restrained from transferring,\n\n alienating, parting with possession or further encumbering any of its\n\n assets.\n\n o) The Applicant, through its Advocates, addressed a letter dated 6 th\n\n April 2021 to the Respondents invoking Arbitration under Clause (k)\n\n of the Sanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. The Applicant also\n\n suggested two names for appointment as Arbitrators. The said letter\n\n was duly served on all the Respondents. The Respondents replied to\n\n the said letter dated 6 th April 2021 by their letter dated 20 th April 2021\n\n whereby the Respondents refused to appoint an Arbitrator.\n\n p) On 8th June 2021, the present Application was filed for\n\n appointment of an Arbitrator.\n\n q) On 4th August, 2021, this Court dismissed the Review Petition\n\n filed by the Respondents seeking a review of the Order dated 12 th\n\n March 2021 passed in the \nSection 9\n Petition filed by the Applicant.\n\n r) On 19th August 2021, the Hon'ble Supreme Court passed an\n\n Order in the SLP filed challenging the said Order dated 4 th August\n\n Page 7 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n 2021 wherein it recorded that in view of the statement made by the\n\n learned counsel for the Applicant (Respondent in the SLP) that they\n\n would not press for the execution of the Order dated 12 th March 2021\n\n till the next date, no interim orders were required to be passed in the\n\n matter.\n\n s) On these facts, Mr.Rohan Savant, the learned counsel appearing\n\n on behalf of the Applicant, submitted that there is a valid arbitration\n\n agreement between the parties as contained in Clause (k) of the\n\n Sanction Letter dated 19th August 2019, that disputes and differences\n\n have arisen between the parties and the Applicant has invoked the\n\n arbitration agreement between the parties by its Advocates letter\n\n dated 6th April 2021.\n\n t) Mr.Rohan Savant further submitted that, in these circumstances,\n\n the present Application ought to be allowed and an Arbitrator be\n\n appointed in order to arbitrate upon all the disputes and differences\n\n arising between the parties under the said Sanction Letter dated 19 th\n\n August 2019.\n\n Page 8 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n3. The Respondents have filed an Affidavit in Reply dated 11 th September\n\n2023 opposing the present Application. On the basis of this Affidavit in\n\nReply, Mr.Pankaj Sawant, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Respondents, submitted that the disputes sought to be referred to\n\nArbitration by the present application are non-arbitrable as the same are\n\nbarred by the provisions of the \nSARFAESI Act\n and the Recovery of Debts due\n\nto Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 (\"RDDB Act\"). In this context,\n\nMr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that the present Application was expressly\n\nbarred under \nSection 34\n of the SARFAESI Act. He submitted that the\n\nApplicant had already initiated proceedings under the \nSARFAESI Act\n, which\n\nprovides a statutory remedy for secured creditors. Upon invoking the\n\nremedies under the special statute, the Applicant cannot now resort to\n\nprivate adjudication by making an artificial bifurcation of the loan amounts\n\nto suit its convenience. Further, Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that, as per\n\nSection 13(10)\n of the SARFAESI Act, a secured creditor must exhaust the\n\nstatutory remedies available under the \nSARFAESI Act\n, and a secured creditor\n\ncan only initiate civil proceedings for any margin left recoverable after\n\nexhausting the remedies under the \nSARFAESI Act\n. Therefore, it was not\n\nopen for the Applicant to elect the remedies in any manner whatsoever.\n\n Page 9 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n4. Mr.Pankaj Sawant also submitted that the present Application is\n\nbarred by RDDB Act. He submitted that \nSection 18\n of the Act confers\n\nexclusive jurisdiction on the DRT for disputes involving debt recovery by the\n\nfinancial institutions. He submitted that the Applicant is a part of a\n\nconsortium and qualifies as a financial institution under the RDDB Act. As a\n\nconsortium member and a financial institution, the Applicant could have\n\nfiled an Application in the DRT under Sections 17 to 19 of the RDDB Act. \nIn\n\nsupport of his submissions, Mr.Pankaj Sawant relied upon the judgement of\n\nthe Division Bench of this Court in \nNaresh J. Doshi and Others vs. Reserve\n\nBank of India and Others1\n.\n\n5. Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the cause of action in the\n\nSummary Suit filed by the Applicant and in the present Application is the\n\nsame, and, by filing the Summary Suit, the Applicant had waived its right to\n\narbitration and the same is barred.\n\n6. In this context, Mr.Pankaj Sawant submitted that there is one loan\n\nagreement, namely the Working Capital Demand Loan Agreement dated 29 th\n\nNovember 2018, one loan account and only one demand notice was issued by\n\nthe Applicant. He submitted that the Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019\n\nrefers to the WCDL Agreement dated 29th November 2018 which is also the\n1 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 11655\n\n Page 10 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nsubject matter of the Summary Suit and states that all securities provided\n\nunder the loan agreements would stand as security for the repayment of One\n\nTime Temporary Limit Facility. Further, the Demand Notice is a composite\n\ndemand issued for both facilities wherein a single amount of\n\nRs.37,61,45,284/- is claimed and One-Time Temporary Limit Facility is also\n\nmentioned. He submitted that no bifurcation of the claim is made in the\n\nDemand Notice, demonstrating that the claims are identical and inseparable.\n\n7. Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the conjoint reading of the\n\naverments in the Summary Suit and the Application filed by the Applicant\n\nunder \nOrder II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908, demonstrates\n\nthat it is the Applicant's express case that the cause of action for the\n\nSummary Suit and the present Arbitration Application is the same.\n\n8. By initiating that Suit based on the same cause of action, the\n\nApplicant has waived its right to arbitration. In this context, Mr.Pankaj\n\nSawant relied upon the judgement of this Court in Onyx Musicabsolute com\n\nPvt.Ltd. & \nOrs. vs. Yash Raj Films Pvt. Ltd. And Ors2\n.\n\n9. Mr.Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the Applicant's attempt to\n\npursue SARFAESI proceedings, the Summary Suit and the Arbitration\n2 (2008) SCC OnLine Bom 636\n\n Page 11 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nconstitutes impermissible forum shopping and would lead to multiplicity of\n\nproceedings, resulting in conflicting judgements from different forums on\n\nthe same set of facts, which is against public policy and judicial propriety. He\n\nsubmitted that the Applicant, being part of the Consortium, cannot be\n\npermitted to bypass statutory remedies while others are following them as\n\nthis creates an uneven playing field.\n\n10. In response to these submissions, Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that\n\nnone of the issues raised by the Respondents can be gone into by the Court\n\nunder \nSection 11\n of the Act as the scope of enquiry in an Application under\n\nSection 11\n of the Act is expressly limited and narrow. He submitted that, in\n\nan Application under \nSection 11\n, the Court only deals with the examination of\n\nthe existence of the Arbitration Agreement. This examination is also done\n\nonly on prima facie basis. No other contentions or issues are considered by\n\nthe Court at this stage. He submitted that even the issue concerning the\n\nvalidity of the arbitration agreement beyond formal validity, such as the\n\nagreement being in writing, cannot be dealt with by the Court while\n\nconsidering the Application under \nSection 11\n of the Act.\n\n11. Mr.Rohan Savant, further submitted that the test \nlaid down by\n the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in \nVidya Drolia and Others vs. Durga Trading\n\n Page 12 of 44\n\n OCTOBER\n 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nCorporation3, such as deadwood, ex facie frivolous and / or the test \nlaid\n\ndown by\n the Supreme Court in \nNTPC Limited vs. SPML Infra Limited\n 4, being\n\nthe eye of the needle test, have now being rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in view of the judgement of the 7 Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Interplay between Arbitration Agreements under\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n and \nStamp Act, 1899\n, In Re 5 and as\n\nexplained by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI General Insurance Co.Ltd.\n vs.\n\nKrish Spinning,6 which specifically considers the effect of the decision in the\n\ncase of Interplay (Supra) on the scope of powers of the referral Court under\n\nSection 11\n of the Act.\n\n12. Without prejudice to this submission, as regards the contention of the\n\nRespondents with respect to the non-arbitrability of the dispute on account of\n\nthe fact that the Applicant had been notified as a financial institution under\n\nSection 2(1) (m)(iv)\n of the SARFAESI Act, Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that,\n\nmerely because the Applicant had been notified as a financial institution\n\nunder the \nSARFAESI Act\n, would not result in the claim being made by the\n\nApplicant becoming non-arbitrable. This was in view of the provisions of the\n\nSARFAESI Act\n, and more particularly \nSections 35\n and \n37\n thereof. He\n\n3 (2021) 2 SCC 1\n4 (2023) 9 SCC 385\n5 (2024) 6 SCC 1\n6 (2024) SCC OnLine 1754\n\n Page 13 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nsubmitted that \nSection 37\n of the SARFAESI Act, in no uncertain terms,\n\nprovides that it is in addition to, and not in derogation of, other laws for the\n\ntime being in force. Hence, the proceedings under the Act can be continued\n\nby a financial institution even when the financial institution institutes or is\n\nentitled institute proceedings under the \nSARFAESI Act\n.\n\n13. Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that the issue of arbitrability and\n\nsimultaneous institution of proceedings under the Act and proceedings under\n\nthe \nSARFAESI Act\n by financial institutions have been dealt with by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the cases of \nM.D.Frozen Foods Exports Pvt. Ltd.&\n\nOrs. vs. Hero Fincorp Ltd.7and India Bulls Housing Finance Ltd.\n vs. Deccan\n\nChronicle Holdings Ltd. & Ors.8 He further submitted that the aforesaid\n\njudgments had been considered by this Court in the case of \nTata Motors\n\nFinance Solutions Ltd. vs. Naushad Khan\n 9.\n\n14. Mr.Rohan Savant submitted that the said judgements clearly\n\ndemonstrate that a financial institution is entitled to simultaneously proceed\n\nunder the \nSARFAESI Act and the Act\n.\n\n7 (2017) 16 SCC 41\n8 (2018) 14 SCC 783\n9 (2023) SCC OnLine BOM 2716\n\n Page 14 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n15. Mr.Rohan Savant further submitted that the Respondents have also\n\nsought to make reference to Transferred Original Application No.210 of\n\n2023 filed under the provisions of the RDDB Act before the DRT, Mumbai\n\nagainst the Respondents to contend that, in light of the said Application,\n\nArbitration Proceedings were not maintainable. Mr. Rohan Savant submitted\n\nthat this contention again is erroneous. The said Original Application has\n\nbeen filed by Union Bank of India, Cosmos Co-operative Bank Limited, Axis\n\nBank Ltd. and State Bank of India. The claim raised in the Original\n\nApplication is in respect of the claim made by the said Banks. This is\n\napparent from the particulars of claim at Annexure U of the Original\n\nApplication. He further submitted that the Original Application specifically\n\nmentioned that the Applicant was only a proforma party. He submitted that\n\nthe claims of the Applicant were not a part of the Original Application filed\n\nbefore the DRT, Mumbai.\n\n16. Further, Mr. Rohan Savant submitted that it is undisputed that the\n\nApplicant cannot take action under the RDDB Act. This is because the\n\nApplicant, as a Non Banking Financial Institution, is not notified under the\n\nRDDB Act. The notification under the \nSARFAESI Act\n does not entitle the\n\nApplicant to file proceedings before the DRT under the RDDB Act.\n\n Page 15 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n17. Mr Rohan Savant further submitted that the next contention raised\n\nby the Respondents was that the Applicant had relinquished / waived the\n\nArbitration Clause contained in the Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019.\n\nMr. Rohan Savant submitted that it is settled law that issues of waiver and\n\nacquiescence are issues on facts and such issues cannot be raised in an\n\nApplication under \nSection 11\n of the Act. Further, he submitted that the prior\n\nfiling of the Commercial Summary Suit would not, in any manner, entitle a\n\nwaiver or relinquishment of the Arbitration Clause in the present\n\nApplication. He submitted that this was because firstly, on facts, the claim\n\nmade in the said Commercial Summary Suit is distinct and separate from the\n\nclaim raised in the \nSection 11\n Application. He further submitted that, even in\n\nlaw, merely because a party has filed a prior suit, would not disentitle such a\n\nparty from filing subsequent arbitration proceedings. In view of \nSection 8\n of\n\nthe Act, the Defendants in the Commercial Summary Suit are at liberty to file\n\nan Application for reference of the dispute to Arbitration. Equally, the\n\nPlaintiff was entitled to withdraw a Suit prior to the Defendants filing their\n\nfirst statement on the substance of the dispute. \nIn support of this submission,\n\nMr. Rohan Savant relied upon the judgement of this Court in \nPriya Rishi\n\nBhuta and Another vs. Vardhaman Engineers and Builders and Others\n 10 .\n\n10 2022 SCC OnLine BOM 1136\n\n Page 16 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n18. Mr. Rohan Savant further submitted that, even on facts, the case of\n\nwaiver set up by the Respondents was completely misconceived and\n\nerroneous. The claim made in the Commercial Summary Suit No.87 of 2022\n\nagainst the Respondents pertained to a separate facility, i.e. the Working\n\nCapital Demand Loan Facility for a sum of Rs.30 crores. The said Suit does\n\nnot include the claim which would be made by the Applicant in the\n\nArbitration proceedings before the Arbitrator, which solely relates to the\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. He submitted that this is apparent\n\nfrom a bare perusal of the Plaint.

Mr. Pankaj Sawant further submitted that the Applicant's reliance on\n\nthe judgment of \nTata Motors Finance Solutions Ltd.\n (Supra) was misplaced\n\nas the said judgement was a judgement of a Single Judge of this Court and\n\ndid not take into consideration the judgement of the Division Bench of this\n\nCourt in \nNaresh J.

Further, as far as the judgement in \nPriya Rishi Bhuta and Another\n\n(Supra) relied upon by the Applicant was concerned, Mr. Pankaj Sawant\n\nsubmitted that\n, \nin that case\n, the cause of action in the civil proceedings and\n\nthe arbitral proceedings were different, whilst, in the present case, the cause\n\nof action and relief sought were inseparable and the same.\n\n Page 19 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n Analysis and Findings\n\n22.

The issue that needs consideration first is whether this Court, in an\n\nApplication under \nSection 11\n of the Act, can go into the objections raised by\n\nthe Respondents.\n\n24. To consider this issue, \nSection 11(6A)\n of the Act is relevant and reads\n\nas under:\n\n \"(6A) The Supreme Court or, as the case may be, the High Court, while\n considering any application under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-\n\n section (6), shall, notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any Court,\n confine to the examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement.\"\n\n25. It is pertinent to note that sub-\nsection 6(A)\n of \nSection 11\n was omitted\n\nby \nSection 3(v)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019.\n\nHowever, the same has not been notified, and, therefore, subsection 6(A) of\n\nSection 11\n continues to remain in force.\n\n26.

Discussion under the heading \"Who Decides Arbitrability?\" can be\n crystallised as under:\n\n 154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. Ltd. on the scope of judicial review by\n the court while deciding an application under \nSections 8\n or 11 of the \nArbitration\n Act\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with retrospective effect from 23-\n 10-2015) and even post the amendments vide Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from\n 9-8-2019), is no longer applicable.\n\n 154.2. Scope of judicial review and jurisdiction of the court under \nSections 8\n\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act is identical but extremely limited and restricted.\n\n 154.3. The general rule and principle, in view of the legislative mandate clear\n from Act 3 of 2016 and Act 33 of 2019, and the principle of severability and\n competence-competence, is that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first\n authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. The court\n has been conferred power of \"second look\" on aspects of non-arbitrability post\n the award in terms of sub-clauses ( i), (ii) or (iv) of \nSection 34(2)(a)\n or sub-\n clause (i) of \nSection 34(2)(b)\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n 154.4. Rarely as a demurrer the court may interfere at \nSection 8\n or 11 stage\n when it is manifestly and ex facie certain that the arbitration agreement is non-\n existent, invalid or the disputes are non-arbitrable, though the nature and facet\n of non-arbitrability would, to some extent, determine the level and nature of\n judicial scrutiny. The restricted and limited review is to check and protect\n parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably \"non-\n arbitrable\" and to cut off the deadwood. The court by default would refer the\n matter when contentions relating to non-arbitrability are plainly arguable;\n when consideration in summary proceedings would be insufficient and\n inconclusive; when facts are contested; when the party opposing arbitration\n adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings. This is\n not the stage for the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as to\n usurp the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity\n and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.\"\n\n Page 21 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nb) Paragraph Nos.92 and 93 of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt in \nIndian Oil Corporation Limited vs. NCC Limited\n 13 are relevant and\n\nare set out here under:\n\n \"92. However, at the same time, we do not agree with the conclusion arrived at\n by the High Court that after the insertion of sub-section (6-A) in \nSection 11\n of\n the Arbitration Act, scope of inquiry by the Court in \nSection 11\n petition is\n confined only to ascertain as to whether or not a binding arbitration agreement\n exists qua the parties before it, which is relatable to the disputes at hand.\n\n 93. We are of the opinion that though the Arbitral Tribunal may have\n jurisdiction and authority to decide the disputes including the question of\n jurisdiction and non-arbitrability, the same can also be considered by the Court\n at the stage of deciding \nSection 11\n application if the facts are very clear and\n glaring and in view of the specific clauses in the agreement binding between the\n parties, whether the dispute is non-arbitrable and/or it falls within the excepted\n clause. Even at the stage of deciding \nSection 11\n application, the Court may\n prima facie consider even the aspect with regard to \"accord and satisfaction\" of\n the claims.\"\n\nc) Paragraph Nos.15 to 17 and 44 to 51 of the judgement of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in \nM.Hemalata Devi and Others\n (Supra) are relevant and are\n\nset out here under:\n\n \"15.

All disputes are not capable of being referred to arbitration [ \"Not all matters\n are capable of being referred to arbitration. As a matter of English law certain\n matters are reserved for the court alone and if a tribunal purports to deal with\n them the resulting award will be unenforceable. These include matters where\n the type of remedy required is not one which an Arbitral Tribunal is empowered\n\n13 (2023) 2 SCC 539\n\n Page 22 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n to give.\" [Russel on Arbitration (22nd Edn.)]] . The nature of certain disputes\n may be such that they should never be sent near an arbitration table. To give an\n illustration, there would be certain types of criminal matters, matters involving\n public corruption, etc. This aspect has been well considered by this Court in\n \nBooz Allen & Hamilton Inc. v. SBI Home Finance Ltd.\n and it has been held as\n under : (SCC pp. 546-47, paras 35-36)\n\n \"35. The Arbitral Tribunals are private fora chosen voluntarily by the parties\n to the dispute, to adjudicate their disputes in place of courts and tribunals\n which are public fora constituted under the laws of the country. Every civil or\n commercial dispute, either contractual or non-contractual, which can be\n decided by a court, is in principle capable of being adjudicated and resolved\n by arbitration unless the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunals is excluded\n either expressly or by necessary implication. Adjudication of certain\n categories of proceedings are reserved by the legislature exclusively for\n public fora as a matter of public policy. Certain other categories of cases,\n though not expressly reserved for adjudication by public fora (courts and\n tribunals), may by necessary implication stand excluded from the purview of\n private fora. Consequently, where the cause/dispute is inarbitrable, the court\n where a suit is pending, will refuse to refer the parties to arbitration, under\n \nSection 8\n of the Act, even if the parties might have agreed upon arbitration\n as the forum for settlement of such disputes.\n\n 36. The well-recognised examples of non-arbitrable disputes are : ( i)\n disputes relating to rights and liabilities which give rise to or arise out of\n criminal offences; (ii) matrimonial disputes relating to divorce, judicial\n separation, restitution of conjugal rights, child custody; ( iii) guardianship\n matters; (iv) insolvency and winding-up matters; (v) testamentary matters\n (grant of probate, letters of administration and succession certificate); and\n\n (vi) eviction or tenancy matters governed by special statutes where the\n tenant enjoys statutory protection against eviction and only the specified\n courts are conferred jurisdiction to grant eviction or decide the disputes.\"\n\n 17. The exclusion of a dispute from arbitration may be express or implied,\n depending again upon the nature of the dispute, and a party to a dispute cannot\n be compelled to resort to arbitration merely for the reason that it has been\n provided in the contract, to which it is a signatory. The arbitrability of a dispute\n has to be examined when one of the parties seeks redressal under a welfare\n legislation, in spite of being a signatory to an arbitration agreement. \"\nThe\n Consumer Protection Act\n\" is definitely a piece of welfare legislation with the\n primary purpose of protecting the interest of a consumer. Consumer disputes\n are assigned by the legislature to public fora, as a measure of public policy.\n Therefore, by necessary implication such disputes will fall in the category of\n non-arbitrable disputes, and these disputes should be kept away from a private\n fora such as \"arbitration\", unless both the parties willingly opt for arbitration\n over the remedy before public fora.\n\n Page 23 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n 44. What were then the factors which necessitated an amendment, inter alia, in\n \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and what was the purpose behind\n these amendments? This aspect again has been examined in detail in Emaar-3.\n Such amendments were recommended by the Law Commission in its 246th\n Report, para 33 of the 246th Report of the Law Commission stated as under:\n\n \"33. It is in this context, the Commission has recommended amendments to\n \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The scope of\n the judicial intervention is only restricted to situations where the\n court/judicial authority finds that the arbitration agreement does not exist or\n is null and void. Insofar as the nature of intervention is concerned, it is\n recommended that in the event the court/judicial authority is prima facie\n satisfied against the argument challenging the arbitration agreement, it shall\n appoint the arbitrator and/or refer the parties to arbitration, as the case may\n be. The amendment envisages that the judicial authority shall not refer the\n parties to arbitration only if it finds that there does not exist an arbitration\n agreement or that it is null and void. If the judicial authority is of the opinion\n that prima facie the arbitration agreement exists, then it shall refer the\n dispute to arbitration, and leave the existence of the arbitration agreement to\n be finally determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. However, if the judicial\n authority concludes that the agreement does not exist, then the conclusion\n will be final and not prima facie.\"\n\n 45. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and Conciliation\n (Amendment) Bill, 2015 reads as under:\n\n \"2. \nThe Act\n was enacted to provide for speedy disposal of cases relating to\n arbitration with least court intervention. With the passage of time, some\n difficulties in the applicability of the Act have been noticed.

A proviso below sub-\n section (2) is inserted to provide that where the original arbitration\n agreement or certified copy thereof is not available with the party who apply\n under sub-section (1), and is retained by the other party, such party shall file\n a copy of the arbitration agreement along with application under sub-section\n (1) praying to the court to call upon the other party to produce the original\n arbitration agreement or its duly certified copy before the court.\"\n\n On amendment to \nSection 11\n by inserting sub-section (6-A), the following\n was stated:\n\n \"Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to amend \nSection 11\n of the principal Act to provide\n that appointment of arbitrator shall be made by the Supreme Court or the\n High Court, as the case may be, instead of the Chief Justice of India or the\n Chief Justice of the High Court. Sub-section (6-A) is inserted to provide that\n the Supreme Court or the High Court while considering application under\n sub-sections (4) to (6) shall confine to the examination of an arbitration\n agreement.\"\n\n 46. The amendment which was made in \nSection 8\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996\n came up for consideration before this Court in Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh\n Enterprises [Ameet Lalchand Shah v. Rishabh Enterprises, where in paras 28\n and 30, it was stated as under : (SCC pp. 697-98)\n \"28. 'Principally four amendments to \nSection 8(1)\n have been introduced by\n the 2015 Amendments -- ( i) the relevant \"party\" that is entitled to apply\n seeking reference to arbitration has been clarified/amplified to include\n persons claiming \"through or under\" such a party to the arbitration\n agreement; (ii) scope of examination by the judicial authority is restricted to\n a finding whether \"no valid arbitration agreement exists\" and the nature of\n examination by the judicial authority is clarified to be on a \"prima facie\"\n\n basis; (iii) the cut-off date by which an application under \nSection 8\n is to be\n presented has been defined to mean \"the date of\" submitting the first\n statement on the substance of the dispute; and ( iv) the amendments are\n expressed to apply notwithstanding any prior judicial precedent.

The language of amendment to \nSection 8\n of the Act is clear that the\n amendment to \nSection 8(1)\n of the Act would apply notwithstanding any\n prayer, judgment, decree or order of the Supreme Court or any other court.\n The High Court laid emphasis upon the word '... unless it finds that prima\n facie no valid agreement exists'.

Jayesh H. Pandya\n, (2003) 5\n SCC 531] and the amended \nSection 8\n and \nSection 45\n of the Act, the High\n Court pointed out the difference in language of \nSection 8\n and \nSection 45\n of\n the Act.\n \nThe High Court distinguished between \nSukanya Holdings [Sukanya\n Holdings (P) Ltd. v.

This Court ultimately held that the main purpose of bringing an amendment\n inter alia in \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996 was to minimise the\n scope of judicial authority, which was to refuse reference to arbitration only on\n the ground when it prima facie finds that there was no valid arbitration\n agreement. The legislative intent for the amendment was confined to limiting\n judicial intervention, and once the Court finds that there is a valid arbitration\n agreement, it has no option but to refer the matter for arbitration. But this\n would not mean that where the matter itself is non-arbitrable, or is covered by a\n special legislation such as the \nConsumer Protection Act\n, it still has to be\n referred for arbitration. In para 59 of Emaar-3, it was stated as under : (SCC pp.\n 781-82)\n\n \"59. The amendment in \nSection 8\n cannot be given such expansive meaning\n and intent so as to inundate entire regime of special legislations where such\n disputes were held to be not arbitrable. Something which legislation never\n intended cannot be accepted as side wind to override the settled law. The\n submission of the petitioner that after the amendment the law as \nlaid down\n by\n this Court in \nNational Seeds Corpn. [National Seeds Corpn. Ltd. v. M.\n Madhusudhan Reddy\n, (2012) 2 SCC 506 : (2012) 1 SCC (Civ) 908] is no more\n a good law cannot be accepted. The words 'notwithstanding any judgment,\n decree or order of the Supreme Court or any court' were meant only to those\n precedents where it was laid down that the judicial authority while making\n reference under \nSection 8\n shall be entitled to look into various facets of the\n arbitration agreement, subject-matter of the arbitration whether the claim is\n alive or dead, whether the arbitration agreement is null and void. The words\n added in \nSection 8\n cannot be meant for any other meaning.\"\n\n Emaar-3 though ends with a caveat, where it leaves the option with the party\n who may have an option to choose between a public or private forum, may\n consciously choose to go for private fora. This is what it says : (SCC p. 783,\n para 63)\n\n Page 26 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n \"63. We may, however, hasten to add that in the event a person entitled to\n seek an additional special remedy provided under the statutes does not opt\n for the additional/special remedy and he is a party to an arbitration\n agreement, there is no inhibition in disputes being proceeded in arbitration.\n It is only the case where specific/special remedies are provided for and which\n are opted by an aggrieved person that judicial authority can refuse to\n relegate the parties to the arbitration.\"\n\n 48. Thus, in our considered opinion in the case at hand, the Telangana High\n Court had adopted the right approach in its two impugned orders, where it\n declined to interfere in the matter and appoint an arbitrator.\n\n 49. True in Emaar-3 this Court had examined the scope of sub-section (1) to\n \nSection 8\n and not of sub-section (6-A) to \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996.\n All the same, the reasoning given in the above judgment would be equally\n applicable to \nSection 11\n application before the High Court. Both the provisions\n incorporated in \nSection 8\n and \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996 [i.e. sub-\n section (1) and sub-section (6-A) respectively], seemingly restrict the scope of\n the examination by the courts concerned, in their reference to arbitration, or\n appointment of arbitrator, as the case might be, and the language being\n common, \"notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order\" places a similar\n question before the two courts.\n\n 50. More importantly, when the Principal Civil Court or a judicial authority\n such as consumer redressal forum can have powers to dismiss a \nSection 8\n\n application on the ground of arbitrability of a dispute, will such powers not be\n available with the High Courts? In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., it was decided\n by this Court that both \nSection 8\n and \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996 are\n complementary provisions. \nThis position has been reiterated, in the post-\n amendment context, in \nVidya Drolia v. Durga Trading Corpn. [Vidya Drolia\n v.\n Durga Trading Corpn.\n\n 51. The application under \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for\n appointment of an arbitrator, was not maintainable in the present case, and\n consequently we uphold the impugned orders dated 19-5-2022 and 25-11-2022,\n which held this position. We refrain from saying anything further on the matter\n as the dispute is still sub judice before the State Consumer Forum (appellate\n authority). The appeals are hereby dismissed. No order as to costs.\"\n\nd) Paragraphs Nos.24 to 28 of the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme\n\n Court in \nNTPC Limited\n (Supra) are relevant and are set out\n\n hereunder:\n\n Page 27 of 44\n\n \nOCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n \"24. Following the general rule and the principle \nlaid down in\n Vidya Drolia, this\n Court has consistently been holding that the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred\n first authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability.\n \nIn\n \nPravin Electricals (P) Ltd. v. Galaxy Infra & Engg. (P) Ltd.\n , Sanjiv Prakash v.\n\n \nSeema Kukreja, and Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. v. NCC Ltd.\n, the parties were\n referred to arbitration, as the prima facie review in each of these cases on the\n objection of non-arbitrability was found to be inconclusive.\n Following the\n exception to the general principle that the Court may not refer parties to\n arbitration when it is clear that the case is manifestly and ex facie non-\n arbitrable, in BSNL v. Nortel Networks (India) (P) Ltd. (hereinafter \"Nortel\n Networks\") and Secunderabad Cantonment Board v. B. Ramachandraiah &\n Sons, arbitration was refused as the claims of the parties were demonstrably\n time-barred.\n\n Eye of the needle\n\n 25. The abovereferred precedents crystallise the position of law that the pre-\n referral jurisdiction of the Courts under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Act is very narrow\n and inheres two inquiries. The primary inquiry is about the existence and the\n validity of an arbitration agreement, which also includes an inquiry as to the\n parties to the agreement and the applicant's privity to the said agreement.\n These are matters which require a thorough examination by the Referral Court.\n The secondary inquiry that may arise at the reference stage itself is with respect\n to the non-arbitrability of the dispute.\n\n 26. As a general rule and a principle, the Arbitral Tribunal is the preferred first\n authority to determine and decide all questions of non-arbitrability. As an\n exception to the rule, and rarely as a demurrer, the Referral Court may reject\n claims which are manifestly and ex facie non-arbitrable. Explaining this\n position, flowing from the principles laid down in Vidya Drolia, this Court in a\n subsequent decision in Nortel Networks held : (Nortel Networks case, SCC p.\n 764, para 45)\n\n \"45. ... 45.1. ... While exercising jurisdiction under \nSection 11\n as the judicial\n forum, the Court may exercise the prima facie test to screen and knockdown\n ex facie meritless, frivolous, and dishonest litigation. Limited jurisdiction of\n the Courts would ensure expeditious and efficient disposal at the referral\n stage. At the referral stage, the Court can interfere \"only\" when it is\n \"manifest\" that the claims are ex facie time-barred and dead, or there is no\n subsisting dispute.\"\n\n 27. The standard of scrutiny to examine the non-arbitrability of a claim is only\n prima facie. Referral Courts must not undertake a full review of the contested\n facts; they must only be confined to a primary first review and let facts speak for\n themselves. This also requires the Courts to examine whether the assertion on\n arbitrability is bona fide or not. The prima facie scrutiny of the facts must lead\n to a clear conclusion that there is not even a vestige of doubt that the claim is\n non-arbitrable. On the other hand, even if there is the slightest doubt, the rule is\n to refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\n Page 28 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n \n28. The limited scrutiny, through the eye of the needle, is necessary and\n compelling. It is intertwined with the duty of the Referral Court to protect the\n parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably non-\n arbitrable. It has been termed as a legitimate interference by Courts to refuse\n reference in order to prevent wastage of public and private resources . Further,\n as noted in Vidya Drolia, if this duty within the limited compass is not\n exercised, and the Court becomes too reluctant to intervene, it may undermine\n the effectiveness of both, arbitration and the Court. Therefore, this Court or a\n High Court, as the case may be, while exercising jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n\n of the Act, is not expected to act mechanically merely to deliver a purported\n dispute raised by an applicant at the doors of the chosen arbitrator , as explained\n in \nDLF Home Developers Ltd. v. Rajapura Homes (P) Ltd\n.\"\n\ne) Paragraph Nos.150 to 169, 219, 220 and 222 of the judgement of the 7\n\n Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra) are\n\n relevant and are set out hereunder:\n\n \"150. \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act deals with the appointment of arbitrators.\n It recognises the autonomy of the parties to agree upon a procedure for\n appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators. \nSection 11\n requires the intervention\n of the Court only when there is a deadlock or failure of the parties to follow the\n appointment procedure. In the process, \nSection 11\n is meant to give effect to the\n mutual intention of the parties to settle their disputes by arbitration in\n situations where the parties fail to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators. In an\n arbitration with three arbitrators, each party is required to appoint one\n arbitrator each, and subsequently the two arbitrators will appoint the third\n arbitrator. \nSection 11(6)\n confers powers on the Supreme Court and the High\n Court, as the case may be, on the failure of the parties to comply with the agreed\n arbitration procedure. \nSection 11(6)\n enlists three possible defects in the\n appointment procedure, namely : first, a party fails to act as required by the\n agreed procedure; second, the parties or the two appointed arbitrators fail to\n reach an agreement expected of them under that procedure; or third, a person,\n including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to them or\n under the agreed procedure.\n\n 151. \nSection 11(6)\n has had a long and chequered history before this Court,\n particularly in respect of the nature of function of the Chief Justice or his\n designate in the appointment of an arbitrator. In SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd.,\n a seven-Judge Bench of this Court held that the power exercised by the Chief\n Justice of India or a Chief Justice of the High Court under \nSection 11(6)\n is a\n judicial power. In the process, this Court analysed the scope of the powers and\n authority of the Referral Court under \nSection 11(6)\n. Moreover, this Court noted\n that \nSections 8\n and \n11\n are complementary in nature. Consequently, if the\n\n Page 29 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n judicial authority acting under \nSection 8\n has to mandatorily decide the issue of\n jurisdiction before referring the parties to arbitration, the same standard of\n scrutiny was also held to be applicable to the reference under \nSection 11\n. In\n conclusion, it was held that the Chief Justice or their designate at the referral\n stage under \nSection 11(6)\n had the right to determine all preliminary issues :\n\n (SCC pp. 663-664, para 74)\n \"47. ... (iv) The Chief Justice or the designated Judge will have the right to\n decide the preliminary aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this\n judgment. These will be his own jurisdiction to entertain the request, the\n existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live\n claim, the existence of the condition for the exercise of his power and on the\n qualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief Justice or the\n designated Judge would be entitled to seek the opinion of an institution in\n the matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of \nSection 11(8)\n of\n the Act if the need arises but the order appointing the arbitrator could only\n be that of the Chief Justice or the designated Judge.\"\n\n \n152. The extent of judicial interference at the referral stage was scrutinised by a\n Bench of two Judges of this Court in \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Boghara\n Polyfab (P) Ltd. This\n Court held that when the intervention of the Court is\n sought under \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act, the following categories of issues\n will arise before the Referral Court:\n\n 152.1. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate is bound to decide.\n\n These issues were : first, whether the party making the application has\n approached the appropriate High Court; and second, whether there is a valid\n arbitration agreement and whether the party who has applied under \nSection 11\n\n of the Act, is a party to such an agreement;\n\n 152.2. The issues which the Chief Justice or his designate may choose to decide\n or leave them to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first,\n whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or a live claim; and second,\n whether the parties have concluded the contract/transaction by recording the\n satisfaction of their mutual rights and obligations or by receiving the final\n payment without objection; and\n\n 152.3. The issues which the Chief Justice or their designate should leave\n exclusively to the Arbitral Tribunal. These issues were : first, whether a claim\n made falls within the arbitration clause (as for example, a matter which is\n reserved for final decision of a departmental authority and excepted or excluded\n from arbitration); and second, merits or any claim involved in the arbitration.\n\n 153. The decisions of this Court in Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab allowed for\n greater judicial interference at the pre-arbitral stage. In effect, the Referral\n Courts were encouraged to conduct mini trials instead of summarily dealing\n with the preliminary issues. This was also noted by the Law Commission of\n India, which observed that judicial intervention in the arbitral proceedings is a\n pervasive problem in India leading to significant delays in the arbitration\n process. The Law Commission recognised that one of the problems plaguing\n\n Page 30 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n implementation of the \nArbitration Act\n was that \nSection 11\n applications were\n kept pending for years by the Courts. To remedy the situation, the Law\n Commission proposed changing the then existing scheme of the power of\n appointment being vested in the \"Chief Justice\" to the \"High Court\" and the\n \"Supreme Court\". It also clarified that the power of appointment of arbitrators\n ought not to be regarded as a judicial act.\n\n 154. Significantly, the Law Commission observed that there was a need to\n reduce judicial intervention at the pre-arbitral stage, that is, prior to the\n constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Accordingly, it proposed limiting the\n scope of the judicial intervention at the referral stage under \nSections 8\n and \n11\n of\n the Arbitration Act \"to situations where the Court/Judicial Authority finds that\n the arbitration agreement does not exist or is null and void\". The Law\n Commission suggested insertion of sub-section (6-A) under \nSection 11\n which\n would read:\"Any appointment by the High Court or the person or institution\n designated by it under sub-section (4) or sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) shall\n not be made only if the High Court finds that the arbitration does not exist or is\n null and void.\" In light of the recommendations of the Law Commission,\n Parliament passed the \nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015\n\n (\"the 2015 Amendment Act\") to incorporate \nSection 11\n(6-A).\n\n 155. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act states\n that sub-section (6-A) is inserted in \nSection 11\n to provide that the Supreme\n Court or the High Court while considering application under sub-sections (4) to\n (6) \"shall confine to the examination of an arbitration agreement\". With the\n coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act, the nature of preliminary\n examination at the referral stage under \nSection 11\n was confined to the existence\n of an arbitration agreement. It also incorporates a non obstante clause which\n covers \"any judgment, decree or order of any court\". By virtue of the non\n obstante clause, \nSection 11\n(6-A) has set out a new position of law, which takes\n away the basis of the position \nlaid down by\n the previous decisions of this Court\n in Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab. It is also important to note that Parliament\n did not incorporate the expression \"or is null and void\" as was suggested by the\n Law Commission. This indicates that Parliament intended to confine the\n jurisdiction of the Courts at the pre-arbitral stage to as minimum a level as\n possible.\n\n 156. The effect and impact of the 2015 Amendment Act was subsequently\n clarified by this Court. \nIn \nDuro Felguera, S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd. Kurien\n Joseph, J.\n noted that the intention of the legislature in incorporating \nSection\n 11\n(6-A) was to limit the scope of the Referral Court's jurisdiction to only one\n aspect -- the existence of an arbitration agreement. To determine the existence\n of an arbitration agreement, the Court only needs to examine whether the\n underlying contract contains a clause which provides for arbitration pertaining\n to the disputes which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. This\n \nCourt further held\n that \nSection 11\n(6-A) incorporates the principle of minimal\n judicial intervention : (SCC p. 765, para 59)\n\n \"59.\n The scope of the power under \nSection 11(6)\n of the 1996 Act was\n\n Page 31 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n considerably wide in view of the decisions in SBP & Co. [SBP & Co. v. Patel\n Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] and Boghara Polyfab. This position continued\n till the amendment brought about in 2015. After the amendment, all that the\n Courts need to see is whether an arbitration agreement exists-nothing more,\n nothing less. The legislative policy and purpose is essentially to minimise the\n Court's intervention at the stage of appointing the arbitrator and this\n intention as incorporated in \nSection 11\n(6-A) ought to be respected.\"\n\n 157. In 2017, the High-Level Committee to Review the Institutionalisation of\n Arbitration Mechanism in India submitted a report noting that while the 2015\n amendment facilitated the speedy disposal of \nSection 11\n applications, they failed\n to limit judicial interference in arbitral proceedings. Accordingly, the High-\n Level Committee recommended the amendment of \nSection 11\n to provide for\n appointment of arbitrators solely by arbitral institutions designated by the\n Supreme Court in case of international commercial arbitrations or the High\n Court in case of all other arbitrations. In view of the report of the High-Level\n Committee, Parliament enacted the \nArbitration and Conciliation (Amendment)\n Act, 2019\n (\"the 2019 Amendment Act\") omitting \nSection 11\n(6-A) so as to leave\n the appointment of arbitrators to arbitral institutions. \nSection 1(2)\n of the 2019\n Amendment Act provides that amended provisions shall come into force on\n such date as notified by the Central Government in the official gazette.\n However, \nSection 3\n of the 2019 Amendment Act which amended \nSection 11\n by\n omitting \nSection 11\n(6-A) is yet to be notified. Till such time, \nSection 11\n(6-A) will\n continue to operate.\n\n 158. \nIn \nMayavati Trading (P) Ltd. v. Pradyuat Deb Burman\n , a three-Judge\n Bench of this Court affirmed the reasoning in \nDuro Felguera [Duro Felguera,\n S.A. v. Gangavaram Port Ltd.\n, (2017) 9 SCC 729 : (2017) 4 SCC (Civ) 764] by\n observing that the examination under \nSection 11\n(6-A) is \"confined to the\n examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement and is to be\n understood in the narrow sense\". Moreover, it held that the position of law\n prior to the 2015 Amendment Act, as set forth by the decisions of this Court in\n Patel Engg. and Boghara Polyfab, has been legislatively overruled. Thus, this\n Court gave effect to the intention of the legislature in minimising the role of the\n Courts at the pre-arbitral stage to the bare minimum.\n\n 159. Thereafter, in Vidya Drolia , another three-Judge Bench of this Court,\n affirmed the ruling in Mayavati Trading that Patel Engg. has been legislatively\n overruled. In Vidya Drolia, one of the issues before this Court was whether the\n Court at the reference stage or the Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration\n proceedings would decide the question of non-arbitrability. This Court began its\n analysis by holding that an arbitration agreement has to satisfy the mandate of\n the \nContract Act\n, in addition to satisfying the requirements stipulated under\n \nSection 7\n of the Arbitration Act to qualify as an agreement.\n\n 160. In the course of the decision, one of the questions before this Court in\n Vidya Drolia was the interpretation of the word \"existence\" as appearing in\n \nSection 11\n. It was held that existence and validity are intertwined. Further, it\n was observed that an arbitration agreement does not exist if it is illegal or does\n not satisfy mandatory legal requirements. Therefore, this Court read the\n\n Page 32 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n mandate of valid arbitration agreement contained in \nSection 8\n into the mandate\n of \nSection 11\n, that is, \"existence of an arbitration agreement\".\n\n 161. At the outset, Vidya Drolia noted that \"\nSection 11\n has undergone another\n amendment vide Act 33 of 2019 with effect from 9-8-2019.\" The purport of the\n omission of the said clause was further explained in the following terms : (SCC\n p. 115, para 145)\n \"145. Omission of sub-section (6-A) by Act 33 of 2019 was with the specific\n object and purpose and is relatable to by substitution of sub-sections (12), (13)\n and (14) of \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act by Act 33 of 2019, which, vide sub-\n section (3-A) stipulates that the High Court and this Court shall have the power\n to designate the arbitral institutions which have been so graded by the Council\n under Section 43-I, provided where a graded arbitral institution is not available,\n the High Court concerned shall maintain a panel of arbitrators for discharging\n the function and thereupon the High Court shall perform the duty of an arbitral\n institution for reference to the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, it would be wrong\n to accept that post omission of sub-section (6-A) of \nSection 11\n the ratio in Patel\n Engg. [SBP & Co. v. Patel Engg. Ltd., (2005) 8 SCC 618] would become\n applicable.\"\n\n 162.Vidya Drolia proceeds on the presumption that \nSection 11\n(6-A) was\n effectively omitted from the statute books by the 2019 Amendment Act. This is\n also reflected in the conclusion arrived at by the Court, as is evident from the\n following extract : (SCC p. 121, para 154)\n\n \"154. ... 154.1. Ratio of the decision in Patel Engg. on the scope of judicial\n review by the Court while deciding an application under \nSections 8\n or 11 of\n the \nArbitration Act\n, post the amendments by Act 3 of 2016 (with\n retrospective effect from 23-10-2015) and even post the amendments vide\n Act 33 of 2019 (with effect from 9-8-2019), is no longer applicable.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n 163. We are of the opinion that the above premise of the Court in Vidya Drolia is\n erroneous because the omission of \nSection 11\n(6-A) has not been notified and,\n therefore, the said provision continues to remain in full force. Since \nSection\n 11\n(6-A) continues to remain in force, pending the notification of the Central\n Government, it is incumbent upon this Court to give true effect to the legislative\n intent.\n\n 164. The 2015 Amendment Act has laid down different parameters for judicial\n review under \nSection 8\n and \nSection 11\n. Where \nSection 8\n requires the Referral\n Court to look into the prima facie existence of a valid arbitration agreement,\n \nSection 11\n confines the Court's jurisdiction to the examination of the existence\n of an arbitration agreement. Although the object and purpose behind both\n \nSections 8\n and \n11\n is to compel parties to abide by their contractual\n understanding, the scope of power of the Referral Courts under the said\n provisions is intended to be different. The same is also evident from the fact\n that \nSection 37\n of the Arbitration Act allows an appeal from the order of an\n\n Page 33 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n Arbitral Tribunal refusing to refer the parties to arbitration under \nSection 8\n, but\n not from \nSection 11\n. Thus, the 2015 Amendment Act has legislatively overruled\n the dictum of Patel Engg. where it was held that \nSection 8\n and \nSection 11\n are\n complementary in nature. Accordingly, the two provisions cannot be read as\n laying down a similar standard.\n\n 165. The legislature confined the scope of reference under \nSection 11\n(6-A) to the\n examination of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The use of the term\n \"examination\" in itself connotes that the scope of the power is limited to a\n prima facie determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code,\n the requirement of \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement draws effect from\n \nSection 7\n of the Arbitration Act. In Duro Felguera, this Court held that the\n Referral Courts only need to consider one aspect to determine the existence of\n an arbitration agreement -- whether the underlying contract contains an\n arbitration agreement which provides for arbitration pertaining to the disputes\n which have arisen between the parties to the agreement. Therefore, the scope of\n examination under \nSection 11\n(6-A) should be confined to the existence of an\n arbitration agreement on the basis of \nSection 7\n. Similarly, the validity of an\n arbitration agreement, in view of \nSection 7\n, should be restricted to the\n requirement of formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement be in\n writing. This interpretation also gives true effect to the doctrine of competence-\n competence by leaving the issue of substantive existence and validity of an\n arbitration agreement to be decided by Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection 16\n. We\n accordingly clarify the position of law laid down in Vidya Drolia in the context\n of \nSection 8\n and \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n 166. The burden of proving the existence of arbitration agreement generally lies\n on the party seeking to rely on such agreement. In jurisdictions such as India,\n which accept the doctrine of competence-competence, only prima facie proof of\n the existence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral\n Court. The Referral Court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-trial\n by allowing the parties to adduce the evidence in regard to the existence or\n validity of an arbitration agreement. The determination of the existence and\n validity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of evidence ought to be left to\n the Arbitral Tribunal. This position of law can also be gauged from the plain\n language of the statute.\n\n \n167. \nSection 11\n(6-A) uses the expression \"examination of the existence of an\n arbitration agreement\". The purport of using the word \"examination\" connotes\n that the legislature intends that the Referral Court has to inspect or scrutinise\n the dealings between the parties for the existence of an arbitration agreement.\n Moreover, the expression \"examination\" does not connote or imply a laborious\n or contested inquiry. On the other hand, \nSection 16\n provides that the Arbitral\n Tribunal can \"rule\" on its jurisdiction, including the existence and validity of an\n arbitration agreement. A \"ruling\" connotes adjudication of disputes after\n admitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the Referral\n Court is only required to examine the existence of arbitration agreements,\n whereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction, including the\n issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement. A\n similar view was adopted by this Court in \nShin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh\n\n Page 34 of 44\n\n OCTOBER\n 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n Optifibre Ltd.\n\n 168. \nIn \nShin-Etsu [Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Aksh Optifibre Ltd.\n, (2005) 7\n SCC 234] , this Court was called upon to determine the nature of adjudication\n contemplated by unamended \nSection 45\n of the Arbitration Act when the\n objection with regards to the arbitration agreement being \"null and void,\n inoperative or incapable of being performed\" is raised before a judicial\n authority. Writing for the majority, B.N. Srikrishna, J. held that Section 45 does\n not require the judicial authority to give a final determination. The Court\n observed that : (SCC p. 267, para 74)\n\n \"74. There are distinct advantages in veering to the view that Section 45 does\n not require a final determinative finding by the Court. First, under the Rules\n of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (as in force with\n effect from 1-1-1998), as in the present case, invariably the Arbitral Tribunal\n is vested with the power to rule upon its own jurisdiction. Even if the Court\n takes the view that the arbitral agreement is not vitiated or that it is not\n invalid, inoperative or unenforceable, based upon purely a prima facie view,\n nothing prevents the arbitrator from trying the issue fully and rendering a\n final decision thereupon. If the arbitrator finds the agreement valid, there is\n no problem as the arbitration will proceed and the award will be made.\n However, if the arbitrator finds the agreement invalid, inoperative or void,\n this means that the party who wanted to proceed for arbitration was given an\n opportunity of proceeding to arbitration, and the arbitrator after fully trying\n the issue has found that there is no scope for arbitration. Since the\n arbitrator's finding would not be an enforceable award, there is no need to\n take recourse to the judicial intercession available under Section 48(1)( a) of\n the Act.\"\n\n 169. When the Referral Court renders a prima facie opinion, neither the Arbitral\n Tribunal, nor the Court enforcing the arbitral award will be bound by such a\n prima facie view. If a prima facie view as to the existence of an arbitration\n agreement is taken by the Referral Court, it still allows the Arbitral Tribunal to\n examine the issue in depth. Such a legal approach will help the Referral Court in\n weeding out prima facie non-existent arbitration agreements. It will also protect\n the jurisdictional competence of the Arbitral Tribunals to decide on issues\n pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement.\n\n 219. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act are as\n follows:\n\n \"6. (iii) an application for appointment of an arbitrator shall be disposed of\n by the High Court or Supreme Court, as the case may be, as expeditiously as\n possible and an endeavour should be made to dispose of the matter within a\n period of sixty days.\n\n (iv) to provide that while considering any application for appointment of\n arbitrator, the High Court or the Supreme Court shall examine the existence\n\n Page 35 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n of a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues.\"\n\n 220. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High Court at the\n stage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall \"examine the existence of a\n prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues\". These other issues not\n only pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also include any\n other issues which are a consequence of unnecessary judicial interference in the\n arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the \"other issues\" also include\n examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by the Referral\n Court at the \nSection 8\n or \nSection 11\n stage. The process of examination,\n impounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument under the \nStamp Act\n\n is not a time-bound process, and therefore does not align with the stated goal of\n the \nArbitration Act\n to ensure expeditious and time-bound appointment of\n arbitrators. Therefore, even though the Law Commission of India Report or the\n Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act do not\n specifically refer to SMS Tea Estates, it nevertheless does not make any\n difference to the position of law as has been set out above.\n\n 222. The scope of authority of an Arbitral Tribunal under \nSection 16\n is wide\n because it can deal with issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an\n arbitration agreement. In his dissenting opinion in N.N. Global (2), Roy, J.\n correctly observes that since \"[s]ection 16 specifically deals with both existence\n and validity whereas \nSection 11\n only deals with existence, the former should be\n given more weight.\" This observation comports with the stated goal of the\n \nArbitration Act\n to minimise the supervisory role of Courts in the arbitral\n process. Post the 2015 Amendment Act the Referral Courts are only required to\n prima facie determine the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement. The\n basis for such prima facie determination lies in the fact that the Arbitral\n Tribunal will later have the competence to rule on the issue of existence and\n validity of the arbitration agreement. Therefore, the separability presumption\n applies at the referral stage.\n\nf) Paragraph Nos.110 to 114, 117, 118, 122 to 125 of the judgement of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in SBI General Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) are\n\nrelevant and are set out hereunder:\n\n \"110. The scope of examination under \nSection 11\n(6-A) is confined to the\n existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of \nSection 7\n. The examination\n of validity of the arbitration agreement is also limited to the requirement of\n formal validity such as the requirement that the agreement should be in writing.\n\n Page 36 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n 111. The use of the term 'examination' under \nSection 11\n(6-A) as distinguished\n from the use of the term 'rule' under \nSection 16\n implies that the scope of\n enquiry under \nsection 11\n(6-A) is limited to a prima facie scrutiny of the\n existence of the arbitration agreement, and does not include a contested or\n laborious enquiry, which is left for the arbitral tribunal to 'rule' under Section\n\n 16. The prima facie view on existence of the arbitration agreement taken by the\n referral court does not bind either the arbitral tribunal or the court enforcing\n the arbitral award.\n\n 112. The aforesaid approach serves a two-fold purpose - firstly, it allows the\n referral court to weed out non-existent arbitration agreements, and secondly, it\n protects the jurisdictional competence of the arbitral tribunal to rule on the\n issue of existence of the arbitration agreement in depth.\n\n 113. Referring to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, it was observed in In Re : Interplay\n (supra) that the High Court and the Supreme Court at the stage of appointment\n of arbitrator shall examine the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement\n and not any other issues. The relevant observations are extracted hereinbelow:\n\n \"209. The above extract indicates that the Supreme Court or High Court at\n the stage of the appointment of an arbitrator shall \"examine the existence of\n a prima facie arbitration agreement and not other issues\". These other issues\n not only pertain to the validity of the arbitration agreement, but also include\n any other issues which are a consequence of unnecessary judicial\n interference in the arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, the \"other issues\"\n\n also include examination and impounding of an unstamped instrument by\n the referral court at the \nSection 8\n or \nSection 11\n stage. The process of\n examination, impounding, and dealing with an unstamped instrument under\n the \nStamp Act\n is not a timebound process, and therefore does not align with\n the stated goal of the \nArbitration Act\n to ensure expeditious and time-bound\n appointment of arbitrators. [...]\"\n\n (Emphasis supplied)\n\n 114. In view of the observations made by this Court in In Re : Interplay (supra),\n it is clear that the scope of enquiry at the stage of appointment of arbitrator is\n limited to the scrutiny of prima facie existence of the arbitration agreement, and\n nothing else. \nFor this reason, we find it difficult to hold that the observations\n made in \nVidya Drolia\n (supra) and adopted in \nNTPC v. SPML\n (supra) that the\n jurisdiction of the referral court when dealing with the issue of \"accord and\n satisfaction\" under \nSection 11\n extends to weeding out ex-facie non-arbitrable\n and frivolous disputes would continue to apply despite the subsequent decision\n in In Re : Interplay (supra).\n\n 117. By referring disputes to arbitration and appointing an arbitrator by exercise\n\n Page 37 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n of the powers under \nSection 11\n, the referral court upholds and gives effect to the\n original understanding of the contracting parties that the specified disputes\n shall be resolved by arbitration. Mere appointment of the arbitral tribunal\n doesn't in any way mean that the referral court is diluting the sanctity of\n \"accord and satisfaction\" or is allowing the claimant to walk back on its\n contractual undertaking. On the contrary, it ensures that the principal of\n arbitral autonomy is upheld and the legislative intent of minimum judicial\n interference in arbitral proceedings is given full effect. Once the arbitral\n tribunal is constituted, it is always open for the defendant to raise the issue of\n \"accord and satisfaction\" before it, and only after such an objection is rejected\n by the arbitral tribunal, that the claims raised by the claimant can be\n adjudicated.\n\n 118. Tests like the \"eye of the needle\" and \"ex-facie meritless\", although try to\n minimise the extent of judicial interference, yet they require the referral court\n to examine contested facts and appreciate prima facie evidence (however\n limited the scope of enquiry may be) and thus are not in conformity with the\n principles of modern arbitration which place arbitral autonomy and judicial\n non-interference on the highest pedestal.\n\n 122. Once an arbitration agreement exists between parties, then the option of\n approaching the civil court becomes unavailable to them. In such a scenario, if\n the parties seek to raise a dispute, they necessarily have to do so before the\n arbitral tribunal. The arbitral tribunal, in turn, can only be constituted as per\n the procedure agreed upon between the parties. However, if there is a failure of\n the agreed upon procedure, then the duty of appointing the arbitral tribunal\n falls upon the referral court under \nSection 11\n of the Act, 1996. If the referral\n court, at this stage, goes beyond the scope of enquiry as provided under the\n section and examines the issue of \"accord and satisfaction\", then it would\n amount to usurpation of the power which the parties had intended to be\n exercisable by the arbitral tribunal alone and not by the national courts. Such a\n scenario would impeach arbitral autonomy and would not fit well with the\n scheme of the Act, 1996.\n\n 123. The power available to the referral courts has to be construed in the light of\n the fact that no right to appeal is available against any order passed by the\n referral court under \nSection 11\n for either appointing or refusing to appoint an\n arbitrator. Thus, by delving into the domain of the arbitral tribunal at the\n nascent stage of \nSection 11\n, the referral courts also run the risk of leaving the\n claimant in a situation wherein it does not have any forum to approach for the\n adjudication of its claims, if it \nSection 11\n application is rejected.\n\n 124. \nSection 11\n also envisages a time-bound and expeditious disposal of the\n application for appointment of arbitrator. One of the reasons for this is also the\n fact that unlike \nSection 8\n, once an application under \nSection 11\n is filed,\n arbitration cannot commence until the arbitral tribunal is constituted by the\n referral court. This Court, on various occasions, has given directions to the High\n Courts for expeditious disposal of pending \nSection 11\n applications. It has also\n\n Page 38 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n directed the litigating parties to refrain from filing bulky pleadings in matters\n pertaining to \nSection 11\n. Seen thus, if the referral courts go into the details of\n issues pertaining to \"accord and satisfaction\" and the like, then it would become\n rather difficult to achieve the objective of expediency and simplification of\n pleadings.\n\n27. A perusal of these judgements shows that, prior to the judgement of\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), the scope of interference by\n\nthe Court in proceedings under \nSection 11\n of the Act was slightly wider.\n\nHowever, the judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra)\n\nhas narrowed down the scope. In Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt has held that the scope of examination under \nsection 11 (6A)\n should be\n\nconfined to the existence of an arbitration agreement on the basis of \nSection 7\n\nof the Act. Similarly, the validity of an arbitration agreement, in view of\n\nSection 7\n of the Act, should be restricted to the requirement of formal validity\n\nsuch as the requirement that the agreement be in writing. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court has held that this interpretation gives true effect to the\n\ndoctrine of competence - competence by leaving the issue of substantive\n\nexistence and validity of an arbitration agreement to be decided by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal under \nSection 16\n of the Act. \nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nInterplay (Supra) accordingly clarified the position of law laid down in \nVidya\n\nDrolia and Others\n (Supra) in the context of \nSection 8\n and \nSection 11\n of the\n\nAct in the aforesaid terms.\n Further, in Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court held that, in jurisdictions such as India, which accept the\n\n Page 39 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\ndoctrine of competence - competence, only prima facie proof of the\n\nexistence of an arbitration agreement must be adduced before the Referral\n\nCourt. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Referral Court is not the\n\nappropriate forum to conduct a mini trial by allowing the parties to adduce\n\nevidence in regard to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement.\n\nThe determination of the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement\n\non the basis of evidence ought to be left to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n28. Further, in Interplay (Supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that\n\nSection 11 (6A)\n uses the expression \"examination of the existence of an\n\narbitration agreement\". The purpose of using the word \"examination\"\n\nconnotes that the legislature intended that the Referral Court had to inspect\n\nor scrutinize the dealings between the parties for the existence of an\n\narbitration agreement. Moreover, the expression \"examination\" does not\n\nconnote or imply a laborious or contested inquiry. On the other hand,\n\nSection 16\n provided that the Arbitral Tribunal can 'rule' on its jurisdiction,\n\nincluding the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement. The Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court further held that a 'ruling' connotes adjudication of disputes\n\nafter admitting evidence from the parties. Therefore, it is evident that the\n\nReferral Court was only required to examine the existence of arbitration\n\nagreements, whereas the Arbitral Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction,\n\n Page 40 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nincluding the issues pertaining to the existence and validity of an arbitration\n\nagreement.\n\n29. The aforesaid position in law laid down by Interplay (Supra) has been\n\nconfirmed by the subsequent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in SBI\n\nGeneral Insurance Co.Ltd. (Supra) referred to hereinabove.\n\n30. In my view, in the light of the aforesaid position in law laid down by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), the objections raised by the\n\nRespondents cannot be gone into by this Court in the present Application\n\nunder \nSection 11\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n31. The objections of the Respondents, namely (i) that the disputes\n\nraised by the Applicant are not non-arbitrable as they are barred by the\n\nprovisions of the SARFAESI Act and the RDDB Act, (ii) that the Applicant\n\nhad waived its right to arbitration by filing a Summary Suit in this Court and\n\n(iii) that allowing of this Application would lead to multiplicity of\n\nproceedings, are not objections regarding the existence of an arbitration\n\nagreement, on the basis of \nSection 7\n of the Act nor are they objections\n\nregarding the validity of the arbitration agreement. In view of \nSection 7\n of the\n\nAct, objections as to validity should be restricted to the requirements of\n\n Page 41 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\nformal validity such as the requirement that the agreement be in writing.\n\nTherefore on the basis of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nInterplay (Supra), I hold that the objections raised by the Respondents\n\ncannot be gone into by this Court in this Application under \nSection 11\n of the\n\nAct.\n\n32. As laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Interplay (Supra), in\n\nan Application under \nSection 11\n of the Act, this Court has only to prima facie\n\ndetermine whether an Arbitration Agreement exists as required by the\n\nprovisions of \nSection 7\n of the Act. In the present case, there exists an\n\nArbitration Agreement between the parties as contained in clause (k) of the\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019. The correspondence between the\n\nparties shows that disputes and differences have arisen between the parties.\n\nThe Applicant has invoked the arbitration agreement contained in the said\n\nSanction Letter dated 19th August 2019 by its Advocate's letter dated 6 April\n\n2021. In these circumstances, I hold that an arbitration agreement exists\n\nbetween the parties and an Arbitrator would have to be appointed in order to\n\narbitrate upon all disputes and differences arising between the parties under\n\nthe said Sanction Letter dated 19 th August 2019. Needless to add, that the\n\nRespondents will be at liberty to raise the objections raised by them to the\n\npresent Application before the Arbitrator.\n\n Page 42 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n33. In light of the aforesaid discussion, and for the aforesaid reasons, the\n\nfollowing order is passed:\n\n (a) Mr. Shanay Shah, an Advocate practising in this Court, is\n appointed as the Arbitrator to arbitrate upon all the disputes\n and differences between the parties under the said Sanction\n letter dated 19th August 2019. Details of Mr. Shanay Shah, who is\n appointed as an Arbitrator, are as under:-\n\n Name :- Mr. Shanay Shah (Advocate)\n Mobile No. :- 9987483450\n Email :- \n[email protected]\n\n Address :- Office No.17-A, 4th Floor, Surya Mahal,\n Burjorji Bharucha Marg, Fort,\n Mumbai 400 023.\n\n (b) The Advocates for the Applicant shall intimate the\n\n Arbitrator about his appointment within a period of one\n week from the date of uploading of this order;\n\n (c) In addition, the Office of the Prothonotary and Senior\n Master of this Court shall also intimate the Arbitrator\n about his appointment within a period of one week from\n the date of uploading of this order.\n\n (d) The Arbitrator so appointed to make the disclosure as\n required under the provisions of the Act within a period\n of one week from the date of intimation of his\n appointment;\n\n Page 43 of 44\n\n OCTOBER 03, 2024\nMohite\n\n ::: Uploaded on - 15/10/2024 ::: Downloaded on - 16/10/2024 00:27:30 :::\n\n carap168-23.doc\n\n (e) The Arbitrator shall charge fees as per the Rules framed by\n this Court in that regard;\n\n34. The Arbitration Application is accordingly disposed of.\n\n35. It is made clear that the Respondents will be at liberty to raise the\n\nobjections raised by them to the present Application before the arbitrator.\n\n [FIRDOSH P.

If the arbitrator finds the agreement valid, there is\n no problem as the arbitration will proceed and the award will be made.\n However, if the arbitrator finds the agreement invalid, inoperative or void,\n this means that the party who wanted to proceed for arbitration was given an\n opportunity of proceeding to arbitration, and the arbitrator after fully trying\n the issue has found that there is no scope for arbitration. Since the\n arbitrator's finding would not be an enforceable award, there is no need to\n take recourse to the judicial intercession available under Section 48(1)( a) of\n the Act.\""
