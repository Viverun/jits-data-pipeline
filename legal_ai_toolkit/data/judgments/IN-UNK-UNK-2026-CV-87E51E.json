That the appellant herein has lodged an FIR against respondent\n\nnos. 2 to 4 herein – original accused at Worli Police Station, Mumbai for\n\nthe offences under \nSections 406\n, \n420\n, \n465\n, \n468\n, \n471\n and \n120B\n of the\n\nIndian Penal Code. That the allegations against the original accused\n\npertain to forgery and fabrication of Board Resolution and the fraudulent\n\nsale of a valuable property Naziribagh Palace ad-measuring 111,882 sq.\n\nft. belonging to the appellant company to one M/s Irish Hospitality Pvt.\n\nLtd.\n\n2.1 Apprehending their arrest in connection with the aforesaid FIR, the\n\noriginal accused filed anticipatory bail application before the learned trial\n\nCourt under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. That the learned Sessions Court,\n\nMumbai granted interim protection from arrest to the alleged accused.\n\nThat the interim protection, which was granted by the learned Sessions\n\nCourt, was further extended from time to time and continued nearly for a\n\nyear thereafter. That during the pendency of the anticipatory bail\n\napplication pending before the learned Sessions Court, Mumbai, original\n\naccused – respondent nos. 2 to 4 herein preferred a petition before the\n\nHigh Court of Judicature at Bombay under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n\nof India r/w \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR, on 17.09.2020.\n\n 2\n\n\fThat the said writ petition was listed for hearing before the Division\n\nBench of the High Court on 22.09.2020, wherein an order was passed\n\ndirecting the matter to be listed on 24.09.2020 before another Bench.\n\nThat on 28.09.2020, the writ petition was listed for hearing before\n\nanother Division Bench. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nappellant herein (respondent no.2 before the High Court) prayed for two\n\nweeks’ time to file an affidavit in reply with an additional compilation of\n\ndocuments. That the Division Bench granted two weeks’ time to the\n\nappellant herein to file an affidavit in reply with an additional compilation\n\nof documents in the Registry on or before 12.10.2020 with copy to the\n\nother side. Liberty was granted to the original accused (writ petitioners\n\nbefore the High Court) to file rejoinder, if any, on or before 19.10.2020.\n\nThe matter was directed to be listed on board on 28.10.2020. While\n\nadjourning the matter to 28.10.2020, the High Court has passed the\n\nimpugned interim order directing that “no coercive measures shall be\n\nadopted against the petitioners (original accused – respondent nos. 2 to\n\n4 herein) in respect of the said FIR”. When the aforesaid order was\n\nbeing passed, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant\n\nsubmitted that anticipatory bail application filed by the original writ\n\npetitioners before the learned Sessions Court is pending for hearing and\n\nthe learned Sessions Court may get influenced by the said order and\n\n 3\n\n\ftherefore the Division Bench clarified that the learned Sessions Court\n\nshall decide the anticipatory bail application on its own merits.\n\n2.2 Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned interim order\n\npassed by the Division Bench of the High Court directing that “no\n\ncoercive measures shall be adopted” against the original accused (writ\n\npetitioners before the High Court) in respect of the said FIR, the original\n\ncomplainant has preferred the present appeal.\n\n3. Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate has appeared on\n\nbehalf of the appellant – original respondent no.2 – complainant, Shri\n\nDiljeet Ahluwalia with Shri Malak Manish Bhatt, learned Advocates have\n\nappeared on behalf of the original accused – writ petitioners –\n\nrespondent nos. 2 to 4 herein and Shri Sachin Patil and Shri Rahul\n\nChitnis, learned Advocates have appeared on behalf of the State of\n\nMaharashtra.\n\n3.1 Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on\n\nbehalf of the appellant – original complainant has vehemently submitted\n\nthat such a blanket direction of the High Court restraining the\n\ninvestigating officer from taking coercive measures, in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, was not warranted at all.\n\n3.2 It is submitted that, as such, the original accused – respondent\n\nnos. 2 to 4 herein were already having the interim protection from the\n\n 4\n\n\flearned Sessions Court, Mumbai in the anticipatory bail application\n\nwhich was continued from time to time since last one year. It is\n\nsubmitted that, as such, the original accused were not co-operating with\n\nthe investigation after having obtained the interim protection of arrest\n\nand, in fact, the investigating officer addressed a communication to the\n\nlearned Sessions Court stating that the accused were not co-operating\n\nwith the investigation. It is submitted that therefore thereafter and that\n\ntoo while enjoying the interim protection from arrest, to file an application\n\nfor quashing after a period of almost one year and obtain such an order\n\nis nothing but an abuse of process.\n\n3.3 It is submitted that, as such, no reasons whatsoever have been\n\nassigned by the High Court while passing such an interim order of “no\n\ncoercive measures to be adopted/taken” against the original accused.\n\n3.4 It is submitted that the High Court ought to have appreciated that\n\nthe original accused – respondent nos. 2 to 4 herein are facing very\n\nserious charges for the offences under \nSections 406\n, \n420\n, \n465\n, \n468\n, \n471\n\nand \n120B\n of the Indian Penal Code and, in fact, the FIR was transferred\n\nto the Economic Offences Wing and the investigation was being\n\nconducted by the Economic Offences Wing. It is submitted that, as\n\nsuch, the original accused were not co-operating with the investigation\n\nafter having obtained the interim protection from arrest.\n\n 5\n\n\f3.5 It is further submitted by Shri Vishwanathan, learned Senior\n\nAdvocate appearing on behalf of the appellant that, as such, by issuing\n\nsuch a blanket direction restraining the investigating officer from taking\n\ncoercive measures against the original accused, the valuable right of the\n\ninvestigating officer to investigate the offences has been hampered\n\nand/or taken away.\n\n3.6 Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of \nState of\n\nTelangana v. Habib Abdullah Jeelani\n, (2017) 2 SCC 779, it is submitted\n\nby Shri Vishwanathan that as observed and held by this Court the\n\npowers under \nSection 482\n Cr. P.C or under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\nConstitution of India to quash the first information report is to be\n\nexercised in a very sparing manner and is not to be used to choke or\n\nsmother the prosecution that is legitimate. It is submitted that it is\n\nobserved by this Court in the aforesaid decision that inherent powers do\n\nnot confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to\n\nwhim or caprice. That such power has to be exercised sparingly, with\n\ncircumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. It is submitted that it\n\ncannot be disputed that accused cannot approach the High Court under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India.\n\nHowever, as held by this Court in catena of decisions, inherent power in\n\na matter of quashing of FIR has to be exercised sparingly and with\n\n 6\n\n\fcaution and when and only when such exercise is justified by the test\n\nspecifically \nlaid down in\n the provision itself. It is submitted that in the\n\naforesaid decision it is observed and held that power under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. is very wide but conferment of wide power requires the Court to\n\nbe more cautious. It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the\n\nCourt.\n\n3.7 It is submitted that in a given case, the Court, having found that the\n\ncase falls within the parameters of exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. to quash the FIR, may pass appropriate interim orders as\n\nthought apposite in law, but even such an interim order shall be passed\n\nregard being had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint\n\nimposed by law. It is submitted that even in such a case the High Court\n\nhas to consider the allegations made in the FIR or what has come out in\n\nthe investigation.\n\n3.8 It is submitted that in a case the accused against whom the FIR is\n\nlodged is apprehending arrest, a remedy is available to him to file the\n\nanticipatory bail application under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. It is submitted\n\nthat even when the anticipatory bail application under \nSection 438\n is\n\nfiled, the same can be granted within the parameters of \nSection 438\n\nCr.P.C. and the conditions of the said provision are satisfied. It is\n\nsubmitted that, however, such a blanket order of no coercive steps\n\n 7\n\n\fwithout imposing any condition whatsoever and without satisfaction of\n\nthe conditions of \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. is not permissible at all.\n\n3.9 It is further submitted that, as such, by passing such a blanket\n\norder of “no coercive steps to be taken”, even the valuable right of the\n\ninvestigating agency/police to investigate the FIR will be affected.\n\n3.10 It is submitted that assuming that the High Court has jurisdiction to\n\npass an interim order in a given case, regard being had to the\n\nparameters of quashing\n, \nin that case\n also, such interim orders cannot be\n\npassed mechanically and/or without assigning any reasons. It is\n\nsubmitted that while granting such a protection, even the High Court has\n\nto give some brief reasons why stay of investigation and/or such an\n\norder of “no coercive steps” is warranted. It is submitted that there must\n\nbe a reflection of application of mind to the facts of the case; allegations\n\nin the FIR and what has come out in the investigation. It is submitted\n\nthat, as such, when the investigation is in progress at the threshold, it is\n\nnot appropriate to stay the investigation of the case. It is submitted that\n\nonly in an exceptional case and rarest of rare case, the powers to quash\n\nthe FIR are required to be exercised sparingly and with circumspection.\n\nIt is submitted that the same parameters which shall be applicable while\n\nexercising the powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle\n\n 8\n\n\f226\n of the Constitution of India to quash the FIR/investigation shall be\n\napplicable while passing an appropriate interim order.\n\n3.11 Shri Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf\n\nof the appellant has relied upon the following decisions on when a High\n\nCourt can grant a stay of investigation or “no coercive measures order”\n\nin exercise of its powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C./under \nArticle 226\n of\n\nthe Constitution of India and in support of his submissions that (1)\n\ninherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court\n\nto act according to whim or caprice and the statutory power has to be\n\nexercised sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases;\n\n(2) power of the police to investigate into a cognizable offence is\n\nordinarily not to be interfered with by the judiciary; (3) save in\n\nexceptional case where non-interference would result in miscarriage of\n\nJustice, the Court and the judicial process should not interfere at the\n\nstage of investigation of offences; (4) in case a police officer\n\ntransgresses the circumscribed limits and improperly and illegally\n\nexercises his powers in relation to the process of investigation, then the\n\nCourt has the necessary powers to consider the nature and extent of the\n\nbreach and pass appropriate orders; (5) the High Court being the highest\n\nCourt of a State should normally refrain from giving a prima facie\n\ndecision in a case where the entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more\n\n 9\n\n\fso when the evidence has not been collected and produced before the\n\nCourt; (6) the High Court has no inherent powers to interfere with the\n\ninvestigation, unless it is found that the allegations do not disclose the\n\ncommission of a cognizable offence or the power of investigation is\n\nbeing exercised by the police malafidely; (7) the High Court should be\n\nextremely cautious and slow to interfere with the investigation and/or trial\n\nof criminal cases and should not stall the investigation and/or\n\nprosecution except when it is convinced beyond any manner of doubt\n\nthat the FIR does not disclose commission of an offence or that the\n\nallegations contained in the FIR do not constitute any cognizable\n\noffence or that the prosecution is barred by law or the High Court is\n\nconvinced that it is necessary to interfere to prevent abuse of the\n\nprocess of the Court. \nIn support of his above submissions, learned\n\nSenior Advocate has relied upon the following decisions, namely, \nKing-\n\nEmperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad\n AIR 1945 PC 18; \nR.P. Kapur v. State\n\nof Punjab\n AIR 1960 SC 866; \nKurukshetra University v. State of Haryana\n\n(1977) 4 SCC 451; \nState of A.P. v. Golconda Linga Swamy\n (2004) 6\n\nSCC 522; \nZandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. v. Mohd. Sharaful Haque\n\n(2005) 1 SCC 122; \nSanapareday Maheedhar Seshagiri v. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n (2007) 13 SCC 165; \nState of Andhra Pradesh v.\n\nBajjoori Kanthaiah\n (2009)1 SCC 114; \nState of Maharashtra v. Arun\n\n 10\n\n\fGulab Gawali\n (2010) 9 SCC 701; and \nState of Orissa v. Ujjal Kumar\n\nBurdhan\n (2012) 4 SCC 547.\n\n3.12 Shri Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate has heavily relied\n\nupon the decision of this Court in the case of \nState of Haryana v. Bhajan\n\nLal\n, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, on when the High Court would be justified\n\nin quashing the FIR/investigation. He has relied upon paras 60, 61, 102\n\nand 103 respectively of the aforesaid decision.\n\n3.13 Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of \nImtiyaz\n\nAhmad v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n, (2012) 2 SCC 688, it is submitted that\n\nthe power to grant stay of investigation and trial is very extraordinary\n\npower given to the High Courts and such power is to be exercised\n\nsparingly only to prevent abuse of process and to promote the ends of\n\njustice.\n\n3.14 Shri Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate also relied upon the\n\nrecent decision of this Court in the case of \nRavuri Krishna Murthy v. The\n\nState of Telangana and others\n (Criminal Appeal Nos.\n \n274-275 of 2021,\n\ndecided on 05.03.2021), by which a somewhat similar order of protection\n\nof not to arrest passed while not entertaining the quashing petition under\n\nSection 482\n, has been set aside by this Court considering the decision\n\nof this Court in the case of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra).\n\n 11\n\n3.15 Shri Vishwanathan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf\n\nof the appellant has further submitted that in the case of \nAsian\n\nResurfacing of Road Agency Private Limited v. Central Bureau of\n\nInvestigation\n, (2018) 16 SCC 299, this Court has observed and held that\n\neven in a case of challenge to the framing of the charge, wherever the\n\nstay is granted by the High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction\n\nor otherwise, a speaking order must be passed showing that the case\n\nwas of an exceptional nature.\n\n3.16 It is further submitted that in many of the cases it is seen that the\n\nHigh Court while not entertaining the quashing petitions under \nSection\n\n482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India and\n\nwhile dismissing such petitions, still grants interim protection/protection\n\nof not to arrest for a particular period or even till the report is filed under\n\nSection 173\n Cr.P.C. It is submitted that the aforesaid is absolutely\n\nimpermissible and such an order of not to arrest for a particular period\n\ncan be said to be beyond the scope and ambit of \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\n\nOnce the quashing petition is dismissed, the accused may avail the\n\nremedy of approaching the trial Court and/or the concerned Court for\n\nanticipatory bail under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C and the same can be\n\nconsidered while imposing the conditions and/or having been satisfied\n\nthat the conditions of grant of anticipatory bail are satisfied. It is\n\n 12\n\n\fsubmitted that in a given case the immediate custodial investigation is\n\nwarranted and in view of such a blanket order of not to arrest, will take\n\naway the right of the investigating agency/police to investigate into the\n\nallegations in the FIR. It is submitted that as held by this Court in catena\n\nof decisions and even as per the provisions of the \nCr.P.C\n., the\n\npolice/investigating officer has the statutory obligation to investigate into\n\nthe allegations in the FIR and to find out the truth. It is submitted that\n\ntherefore such a protection while dismissing the petition under \nSection\n\n482\n Cr.P.C and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India is not\n\nsustainable and is wholly impermissible. It is submitted that despite\n\nsuch orders have been criticized by this Court in the case of \nHabib\n\nAbdullah Jeelani\n (supra), still the High Courts are passing such orders,\n\ndisregarding the law \nlaid down by\n this Court.\n\n4. Shri Diljeet Ahluwalia and Shri Malak Manish Bhatt, learned\n\nAdvocates appearing on behalf of the original accused – respondent\n\nnos. 2 to 4 herein have vehemently submitted that, as such, in the facts\n\nand circumstances of the case and looking to the nature of the\n\nallegations made in the FIR and the dispute which, as such, can be said\n\nto be a civil dispute, no error has been committed by the High Court in\n\npassing such an order of “no coercive steps” against respondent nos. 2\n\nto 4 herein – original accused – original writ petitioners.\n\n 13\n\n\f4.1 Number of submissions have been made by the learned\n\nAdvocates appearing on behalf of respondent nos. 2 to 4 herein –\n\noriginal accused – original writ petitioners on merits and in support of\n\ntheir submissions that the impugned FIR is nothing but an abuse of\n\nprocess of law and that a civil dispute is tried to be converted into a\n\ncriminal dispute, only with a view to harass respondent nos. 2 to 4\n\nherein. However, we do not propose to deal with the case on merits and\n\nconsider whether the impugned FIR is an abuse of process of law or not,\n\nas \nSection 482\n petition is yet required to be dealt with by the High Court\n\non merits in the pending proceedings.\n\n4.2 Learned Advocates appearing on behalf of respondent nos. 2 to 4\n\nherein – original accused – original writ petitioners have submitted that\n\nas held by this Court in catena of decisions, the powers possessed by\n\nthe High Court under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\nConstitution of India are very wide. It is submitted that as held by this\n\nCourt, the High Court may exercise its powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\n\nand/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India relating to\n\ncognizable offences to prevent abuse of process of any court or\n\notherwise to secure the ends of justice. It is submitted therefore in\n\nexercise of its wholesome powers, the High Court would be justified and\n\nentitled to quash the proceedings. It is submitted that similarly the High\n\n 14\n\n\fCourt would be justified and entitled to stay the further investigation and\n\neven grant an interim order of stay of arrest and/or “no coercive\n\nmeasures to be taken”.\n\n4.3 It is submitted that in the case of \nState of Karnataka v. L.\n\nMuniswamy\n, (1977) 2 SCC 699, it is observed by this Court that the High\n\nCourt in its inherent powers is designed to achieve a salutary public\n\npurpose which is that a court proceeding ought not to be permitted to\n\ndegenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution.\n\n4.4 It is submitted that if the Court is of the prima facie view that further\n\ninvestigation or proceedings pursuant to the FIR is likely to cause\n\nunwarranted and unjustified harassment to the petitioner, the Court may\n\ngrant an order of “no coercive measures” in favour of the accused.\n\n4.5 It is further submitted by the learned Advocates appearing on\n\nbehalf of respondent nos. 2 to 4 herein – original accused – original writ\n\npetitioners that powers to grant interim stay/interim relief in a quashing\n\npetition under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\nConstitution of India are akin to the powers of the civil court under \nOrder\n\nXXXIX Rule 1 CPC\n, namely, prima facie case; balance of convenience\n\nand irreparable loss. It is submitted that therefore an interim injunction\n\nrestraining the police from investigation consequent to the FIR can be\n\n 15\n\n\fjustified on the touchstone of balance of convenience, irreparable loss\n\nand a prima facie case.\n\n4.6 Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of \nImtiyaz\n\nAhmad\n (supra), it is submitted that the authority of the High Court to\n\norder stay of investigation pursuant to lodging of the FIR or trial in\n\ndeserving cases is unquestionable. However, the learned Advocates\n\nhave fairly conceded that wherever stay is granted, a speaking order\n\nmust be passed showing that the case is of an exceptional nature.\n\n4.7 It is vehemently submitted by the learned Advocates that when a\n\ncriminal proceeding initiated pursuant to the FIR/complaint is nothing but\n\nan abuse of process of law and/or the same is wholly without jurisdiction\n\nor where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against the\n\ninstitution or continuance of the criminal proceeding in respect of the\n\noffence alleged or where the allegations in the FIR/complaint even if they\n\nare taken at the face value and accepted in their entirety, do not\n\nconstitute the offence alleged and exceptional case being made out on\n\nthe grounds mentioned by this Court in the cases of \nBhajan Lal\n (supra);\n\nR.P. Kapur\n (supra); and \nZandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd.\n (supra), by\n\ngiving brief reasons, the High Court would be justified in even staying the\n\nfurther investigation, by way of an interim order. It is submitted that\n\nmisuse of criminal proceedings is not unknown and the criminal law\n\n 16\n\n\fcannot be set into motion as a matter of course and therefore to take\n\naway the inherent powers of the High Court would not be in the larger\n\npublic interest also.\n\n4.8 Relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of \nRajiv Thapar\n\nV. Madan Lal Kapoor\n, (2013) 3 SCC 330, it is submitted that while\n\nexercising the powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., the High Court is\n\nrequired to undertake step-wise enquiry as mentioned in para 30 of \nthe\n\nsaid decision\n and if the answer to all the steps is in the affirmative, the\n\nHigh Court would be justified in quashing the criminal proceedings.\n \nIt is\n\nsubmitted that the grounds on which the criminal proceedings can be\n\nquashed in exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., the very\n\ngrounds can be made applicable while granting stay of further\n\ninvestigation, pending the quashing petition under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\n\n4.9 In support of his submissions, learned Advocates have relied upon\n\nthe following decisions of this Court and various High Courts, namely,\n\nState of U.P. v. Mohammad Naim\n AIR 1964 SC 703; \nL. Muniswamy\n\n(supra); \nState of Andhra Pradesh v. Gourishetty Mahesh\n (2010) 11 SCC\n\n226; \nVijeta Gajra v. State (NCT of Delhi\n), (2010) 11 SCC 618; \nRajiv\n\nThapar\n (supra); State of Maharashtra v. Sanjay Dalmia, (2015) 17 SCC\n\n539; \nAmish Devgan v. Union of India\n, (2021) 1 SCC 1; the decision of\n\nthe Delhi High Court in \nGanga Ram Hospital v. State\n dated 22.06.2020\n\n 17\n\n\fin CRL.M.A. No. 7661/2020 in W.P. (CRL.)\n \nNo. 921/2020; the decision of\n\nthe Rajasthan High Court in \nNoor Taki Alias Mammu v. State of\n\nRajasthan\n dated 26.02.1986 AIR 1987 RAJ 52; and decision of the\n\nBombay High Court in \nMadhukar Purshottam Mondkar v. Talab Haji\n\nHussain\n dated 14.01.1958 AIR 1958 BOM 406.\n\n5. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the respective\n\nparties at length.\n\n6. The principal issue which arises is when and where the High Court\n\nwould be justified in passing an interim order either staying the further\n\ninvestigation in the FIR/complaint or interim order in the nature of “no\n\ncoercive steps” and/or not to arrest the accused either pending\n\ninvestigation by the police/investigating agency or during the pendency\n\nof the quashing petition under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle\n\n226\n of the Constitution of India pending before the High Court?\n\n7. While considering the aforesaid issue, law on the exercise of\n\npowers by the High Court under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle\n\n226\n of the Constitution of India to quash the FIR/complaint and the\n\nparameters for exercise of such powers and scope and ambit of the\n\npower by the High Court under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle\n\n226\n of the Constitution of India are required to be referred to as the very\n\n 18\n\n\fparameters which are required to be applied while quashing the FIR will\n\nalso be applicable while granting interim stay/protection.\n\n7.1 The first case on the point which is required to be noticed is the\n\ndecision of this Court in the case of \nR.P. Kapur\n (supra). While dealing\n\nwith the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 561-A of the\n\nearlier Code (which is pari materia with \nSection 482\n of the Code), it is\n\nobserved and held that the inherent powers of the High Court under\n\nSection 561 of the earlier Code cannot be exercised in regard to the\n\nmatters specifically covered by the other provisions of the Code; the\n\ninherent jurisdiction of the High Court can be exercised to quash\n\nproceedings in a proper case either to prevent the abuse of the process\n\nof any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice; ordinarily criminal\n\nproceedings instituted against an accused person must be tried under\n\nthe provisions of the Code, and the High Court would be reluctant to\n\ninterfere with the said proceedings at an interlocutory stage. After\n\nobserving this, thereafter this Court then carved out some exceptions to\n\nthe above-stated rule, which are as under:\n\n “(i) Where it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar against\n the institution or continuance of the criminal proceeding in respect of\n the offence alleged. Absence of the requisite sanction may, for\n instance, furnish cases under this category.\n\n (ii) Where the allegations in the first information report or the\n complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in\n their entirety, do not constitute the offence alleged; in such cases no\n question of appreciating evidence arises; it is a matter merely of\n\n 19\n\n\f looking at the complaint or the first information report to decide\n whether the offence alleged is disclosed or not.\n\n (iii) Where the allegations made against the accused person do\n constitute an offence alleged but there is either no legal evidence\n adduced in support of the case or the evidence adduced clearly or\n manifestly fails to prove the charge. In dealing with this class of cases it\n is important to bear in mind the distinction between a case where there\n is no legal evidence or where there is evidence which is manifestly and\n clearly inconsistent with the accusation made and cases where there is\n legal evidence which on its appreciation may or may not support the\n accusation in question. In exercising its jurisdiction under Section 561-\n\n \nA the High Court would not embark upon an enquiry as to whether the\n evidence in question is reliable or not. That is the function of the trial\n Magistrate, and ordinarily it would not be open to any party to invoke\n the High Court's inherent jurisdiction and contend that on a reasonable\n appreciation of the evidence the accusation made against the accused\n would not be sustained.”\n\n7.2 In the case of \nKurukshetra University\n (supra), this Court observed\n\nand held that inherent powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. do not confer\n\nan arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or\n\ncaprice; that statutory power has to be exercised sparingly with\n\ncircumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. In the case before this\n\nCourt, the High Court quashed the first information report filed by the\n\nKurukshetra University through Warden and that too without issuing\n\nnotice to the University, in exercise of inherent powers under \nSection\n\n482\n Cr.P.C. This Court noticed and observed that the High Court was\n\nnot justified in quashing the FIR when the police had not even\n\ncommenced investigation into the complaint filed by the Warden of the\n\nUniversity and no proceedings were at all pending before any Court in\n\npursuance of the FIR.\n\n 20\n\n\f7.3 Then comes the celebrated decision of this Court in the case of\n\nBhajan Lal\n (supra). In \nthe said decision\n, this Court considered in detail\n\nthe scope of the High Court powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or\n\nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India to quash the FIR and referred to\n\nseveral judicial precedents and held that the High Court should not\n\nembark upon an inquiry into the merits and demerits of the allegations\n\nand quash the proceedings without allowing the investigating agency to\n\ncomplete its task. At the same time, this Court identified the following\n\ncases in which FIR/complaint can be quashed:\n\n “102.(1) Where the allegations made in the first information\n report or the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and\n accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or\n make out a case against the accused.\n\n (2) Where the allegations in the first information report and other\n materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a cognizable\n offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under \nSection\n 156(1)\n of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the\n purview of \nSection 155(2)\n of the Code.\n\n (3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or\n complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not\n disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against\n the accused.\n\n (4) Where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a\n cognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no\n investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a\n Magistrate as contemplated under \nSection 155(2)\n of the Code.\n\n (5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so\n absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent\n person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground\n for proceeding against the accused.\n\n (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the\n provisions of the Code or the Act concerned (under which a criminal\n proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the\n\n 21\n\n\f proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or\n the Act concerned, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of\n the aggrieved party.\n\n \n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with\n mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an\n ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view\n to spite him due to private and personal grudge.”\n\n7.4 In the case of \nGolconda Lingaswamy\n (supra), after considering the\n\ndecisions of this Court in the cases of \nR.P. Kapur\n (supra) and \nBhajan Lal\n\n(supra) and other decisions on the exercise of inherent powers by the\n\nHigh Court under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C., in paragraphs 5, 7 and 8, it is\n\nobserved and held as under:\n\n “5. Exercise of power under \nSection 482\n of the Code in a case\n of this nature is the exception and not the rule. The section does not\n confer any new powers on the High Court. It only saves the inherent\n power which the Court possessed before the enactment of the Code. It\n envisages three circumstances under which the inherent jurisdiction\n may be exercised, namely: (i) to give effect to an order under the Code,\n\n (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and (iii) to otherwise\n secure the ends of justice. It is neither possible nor desirable to lay\n down any inflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent\n jurisdiction. No legislative enactment dealing with procedure can\n provide for all cases that may possibly arise. Courts, therefore, have\n inherent powers apart from express provisions of law which are\n necessary for proper discharge of functions and duties imposed upon\n them by law. That is the doctrine which finds expression in the section\n which merely recognises and preserves inherent powers of the High\n Courts. All courts, whether civil or criminal, possess in the absence of\n any express provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers\n as are necessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of\n administration of justice on the principle quando lex aliquid alique\n concedit, conceditur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potest (when the\n law gives a person anything, it gives him that without which it cannot\n exist). While exercising powers under the section, the Court does not\n function as a court of appeal or revision. \nInherent jurisdiction under the\n section though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with\n\n 22\n\n\fcaution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically\n\nlaid down in\n the section itself. It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to\ndo real and substantial justice for the administration of which alone\ncourts exist. Authority of the court exists for advancement of justice and\nif any attempt is made to abuse that authority so as to produce\ninjustice, the court has power to prevent such abuse. It would be an\nabuse of the process of the court to allow any action which would result\nin injustice and prevent promotion of justice. In exercise of the powers\ncourt would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation\nor continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or\nquashing of these proceedings would otherwise serve the ends of\njustice. When no offence is disclosed by the complaint, the court may\nexamine the question of fact. When a complaint is sought to be\nquashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to assess what the\ncomplainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out even if\nthe allegations are accepted in toto.\n\n 7. In dealing with the last category, it is important to bear in mind\nthe distinction between a case where there is no legal evidence or\nwhere there is evidence which is clearly inconsistent with the\naccusations made, and a case where there is legal evidence which, on\nappreciation, may or may not support the accusations. When\nexercising jurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of the Code, the High Court\nwould not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in\nquestion is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it\naccusation would not be sustained. That is the function of the trial\nJudge. Judicial process, no doubt should not be an instrument of\noppression, or, needless harassment. Court should be circumspect and\njudicious in exercising discretion and should take all relevant facts and\ncircumstances into consideration before issuing process, lest it would\nbe an instrument in the hands of a private complainant to unleash\nvendetta to harass any person needlessly. At the same time the section\nis not an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a\nprosecution and bring about its sudden death…..\n\n 8. As noted above, the powers possessed by the High Court\nunder \nSection 482\n of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of\nthe power requires great caution in its exercise. Court must be careful\nto see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound\nprinciples. The inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a\nlegitimate prosecution. High Court being the highest court of a State\nshould normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case\nwhere the entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the\nevidence has not been collected and produced before the Court and\nthe issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of magnitude and\n\n 23\n\n\f cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. Of\n course, no hard-and-fast rule can be \nlaid down in\n regard to cases in\n which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of\n quashing the proceeding at any stage. \n[See \nJanata Dal v. H.S.\n Chowdhary\n [(1992) 4 SCC 305 : 1993 SCC (Cri) 36 : AIR 1993 SC 892]\n and Raghubir Saran (Dr.) v. State of Bihar [AIR 1964 SC 1 : (1964) 1\n Cri LJ 1] .] It would not be proper for the High Court to analyse the case\n of the complainant in the light of all probabilities in order to determine\n whether a conviction would be sustainable and on such premises,\n arrive at a conclusion that the proceedings are to be quashed. It would\n be erroneous to assess the material before it and conclude that the\n complaint cannot be proceeded with. In a proceeding instituted on\n complaint, exercise of the inherent powers to quash the proceedings is\n called for only in a case where the complaint does not disclose any\n offence or is frivolous, vexatious or oppressive. If the allegations set\n out in the complaint do not constitute the offence of which cognisance\n has been taken by the Magistrate, it is open to the High Court to quash\n the same in exercise of the inherent powers under \nSection 482\n of the\n Code. It is not, however, necessary that there should be meticulous\n analysis of the case before the trial to find out whether the case would\n end in conviction or acquittal. The complaint/FIR has to be read as a\n whole. If it appears that on consideration of the allegations in the light\n of the statement made on oath of the complainant or disclosed in the\n FIR that the ingredients of the offence or offences are disclosed and\n there is no material to show that the complaint/FIR is mala fide,\n frivolous or vexatious, in that event there would be no justification for\n interference by the High Court. When an information is lodged at the\n police station and an offence is registered, then the mala fides of the\n informant would be of secondary importance. It is the material collected\n during the investigation and evidence led in court which decides the\n fate of the accused person.\n \nThe allegations of mala fides against the\n informant are of no consequence and cannot by themselves be the\n basis for quashing the proceeding.”\n\n7.5 In the case of \nZandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd.\n (supra), in\n\nparagraph 11, this Court has observed and held as under:\n\n \n“11. … the powers possessed by the High Court under \nSection 482\n of\n the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires\n great caution in its exercise. Court must be careful to see that its\n decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The\n inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate\n prosecution. The High Court being the highest court of a State should\n\n 24\n\n\f normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where the\n entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the evidence has\n not been collected and produced before the court and the issues\n involved, whether factual or legal, are of magnitude and cannot be\n seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. of course, no\n hard-and-fast rule can be \nlaid down in\n regard to cases in which the\n High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the\n proceeding at any stage. It would not be proper for the High Court to\n analyse the case of the complainant in the light of all probabilities in\n order to determine whether a conviction would be sustainable and on\n such premise arrive at a conclusion that the proceedings are to be\n quashed.

When an information is lodged at\n the police station and an offence is registered, then the mala fides of\n the informant would be of secondary importance. It is the material\n collected during the investigation and evidence led in court which\n decides the fate of the accused person.\n \nThe allegations of mala fides\n against the informant are of no consequence and cannot by\n themselves be the basis for quashing the proceedings.”\n\n7.6 In the case of \nSanapareddy Maheedhar Seshagiri\n (supra), in\n\nparagraph 31, it is observed and held as under:\n\n “31. A careful reading of the abovenoted judgments makes it\n clear that the High Court should be extremely cautious and slow to\n interfere with the investigation and/or trial of criminal cases and should\n not stall the investigation and/or prosecution except when it is\n convinced beyond any manner of doubt that FIR does not disclose\n commission of any offence or that the allegations contained in FIR do\n not constitute any cognizable offence or that the prosecution is barred\n by law or the High Court is convinced that it is necessary to interfere to\n prevent abuse of the process of the Court. In dealing with such cases,\n\n 25\n\n\f the High Court has to bear in mind that judicial intervention at the\n threshold of the legal process initiated against a person accused of\n committing offence is highly detrimental to the larger public and\n societal interest. The people and the society have a legitimate\n expectation that those committing offences either against an individual\n or the society are expeditiously brought to trial and, if found guilty,\n adequately punished. Therefore, while deciding a petition filed for\n quashing FIR or complaint or restraining the competent authority from\n investigating the allegations contained in FIR or complaint or for stalling\n the trial of the case, the High Court should be extremely careful and\n circumspect. If the allegations contained in FIR or complaint disclose\n commission of some crime, then the High Court must keep its hands\n off and allow the investigating agency to complete the investigation\n without any fetter and also refrain from passing order which may\n impede the trial. \nThe High Court should not go into the merits and\n demerits of the allegations simply because the petitioner alleges malus\n animus against the author of FIR or the complainant. The High Court\n must also refrain from making imaginary journey in the realm of\n possible harassment which may be caused to the petitioner on account\n of investigation of FIR or complaint. Such a course will result in\n miscarriage of justice and would encourage those accused of\n committing crimes to repeat the same. However, if the High Court is\n satisfied that the complaint does not disclose commission of any\n offence or prosecution is barred by limitation or that the proceedings of\n criminal case would result in failure of justice, then it may exercise\n inherent power under \nSection 482\n CrPC.”\n\n7.7 In the case of \nArun Gulab Gawali\n (supra), this Court set aside the\n\norder passed by the High Court quashing the criminal complaint/FIR\n\nwhich was even filed by the complainant. In the case before this Court,\n\nprayer for quashing the FIR before the High Court was by the\n\ncomplainant himself and the High Court quashed the FIR/complaint in\n\nexercise of the powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. Quashing and setting\n\naside the judgment and order passed by the High Court quashing the\n\nFIR, this Court in paragraphs 13 and 27 to 29 has observed as under:\n\n “13. The power of quashing criminal proceedings has to be\n exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the\n\n 26\n\n\frarest of rare cases and the Court cannot be justified in embarking\nupon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of\nallegations made in the FIR/complaint, unless the allegations are so\npatently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person\ncan ever reach such a conclusion. The extraordinary and inherent\npowers of the Court do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court\nto act according to its whims or caprice. However, the Court, under its\ninherent powers, can neither intervene at an uncalled for stage nor\ncan it “soft-pedal the course of justice” at a crucial stage of\ninvestigation/proceedings. The provisions of \nArticles 226\n, 227\n of the\nConstitution of India and \nSection 482\n of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973 (hereinafter called as “\nCrPC\n”) are a device to\nadvance justice and not to frustrate it. The power of judicial review is\ndiscretionary, however, it must be exercised to prevent the miscarriage\nof justice and for correcting some grave errors and to ensure that\nstream of administration of justice remains clean and pure. However,\nthere are no limits of power of the Court, but the more the power, the\nmore due care and caution is to be exercised in invoking these\npowers. (Vide State of W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha [(1982) 1 SCC\n561 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 283 : AIR 1982 SC 949] , Pepsi Foods\nLtd. v. Special Judicial Magistrate [(1998) 5 SCC 749 : 1998 SCC (Cri)\n1400] , G. Sagar Suri v. State of U.P. [(2000) 2 SCC 636 : 2000 SCC\n(Cri) 513 : AIR 2000 SC 754] and Ajay Mitra v. State of M.P. [(2003) 3\nSCC 11 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 703] )\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 27. The High Court proceeded on the perception that as the\ncomplainant himself was not supporting the complaint, he would not\nsupport the case of the prosecution and there would be no chance of\nconviction, thus the trial itself would be a futile exercise. Quashing of\nFIR/complaint on such a ground cannot be held to be justified in law.\n\nOrdinarily, the Court of Session is empowered to discharge an\naccused under \nSection 227\n CrPC even before initiating the trial. The\naccused can, therefore, move the trial court itself for such a relief and\nthe trial court would be in a better position to analyse and pass an\norder as it is possessed of all the powers and the material to do so. It\nis, therefore, not necessary to invoke the jurisdiction under \nSection\n482\n CrPC for the quashing of a prosecution in such a case. The\nreliance on affidavits by the High Court would be a weak, hazy and\nunreliable source for adjudication on the fate of a trial. The\npresumption that an accused would never be convicted on the\nmaterial available is too risky a proposition to be accepted readily,\nparticularly in heinous offences like extortion.\n\n 27\n\n\f 28. A claim founded on a denial by the complainant even before\n the trial commences coupled with an allegation that the police had\n compelled the lodging of a false FIR, is a matter which requires further\n investigation as the charge is levelled against the police. If the\n prosecution is quashed, then neither the trial court nor the\n investigating agency has any opportunity to go into this question,\n which may require consideration. The State is the prosecutor and all\n prosecution is the social and legal responsibility of the State. An\n offence committed is a crime against society and not against the victim\n alone. The victim under undue pressure or influence of the accused or\n under any threat or compulsion may resile back but that would not\n absolve the State from bringing the accused to book, who has\n committed an offence and has violated the law of the land.\n\n 29. Thus, while exercising such power the Court has to act\n cautiously before proceeding to quash a prosecution in respect of an\n offence which hits and affects the society at large. It should be a case\n where no other view is possible nor any investigation or inquiry is\n further required. There cannot be a general proposition of law, so as to\n fit in as a straitjacket formula for the exercise of such power. Each\n case will have to be judged on its own merit and the facts warranting\n exercise of such power. More so, it was not a case of civil nature\n where there could be a possibility of compromise or involving an\n offence which may be compoundable under \nSection 320\n CrPC, where\n the Court could apply the ratio of Madhavrao Jiwajirao Scindia [(1988)\n 1 SCC 692 : 1988 SCC (Cri) 234 : AIR 1988 SC 709] .”\n\n7.8 Thereafter in catena of decisions, this Court has reiterated the\n\nparameters for exercise of inherent powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\n\nand/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India in the matter of\n\nquashing the FIR/complaint.\n\n8. While considering the issue involved, the rights and duties of the\n\npolice to investigate into cognizable offences are also required to be\n\nconsidered.\n\n8.1 The powers of investigation into cognizable offences are contained\n\nin Chapter XIV of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n. \nSection 154\n deals\n\n 28\n\n\fwith information in cognizable offence and \nSection 156\n with investigation\n\ninto such offence and under these sections the police have the statutory\n\nright to investigate into the circumstances of any alleged cognizable\n\noffence.\n\n8.2 The Privy Council in the case of \nKhwaja Nazir Ahmad\n (supra)\n\nobserved that in India, there is a statutory right on the part of the police\n\nto investigate the circumstances of an alleged cognizable crime without\n\nrequiring any authority from the judicial authorities. It is further observed\n\nthat it would be an unfortunate result if it should be held possible to\n\ninterfere with those statutory rights by an exercise of the inherent\n\njurisdiction of the court. It is further observed that the functions of the\n\njudiciary and the police are complementary, not overlapping, and the\n\ncombination of individual liberty with a due observance of law and order\n\nis only to be obtained by leaving each to exercise its own function.\n\n9. When the High Court would be justified in interfering with the\n\ninvestigation by the police, while exercising the inherent powers under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India, few\n\ndecisions of this Court are required to be noticed and referred to, which\n\nare as under.\n\n9.1 In the case of \nState of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha\n, (1980) 1 SCC\n\n554, this Court, after referring to the precedents including the decision of\n\n 29\n\n\fthe Privy Council in the case of \nKhawaja Nazir Ahmad\n (supra), has\n\nobserved in paragraphs 25 and 26 as under:\n\n \n“25. There is a clear-cut and well demarcated sphere of activity\n in the field of crime detection and crime punishment. Investigation of an\n offence is the field exclusively reserved for the executive through the\n police department the superintendence over which vests in the State\n Government. The executive which is charged with a duty to keep\n vigilance over law and order situation is obliged to prevent crime and if\n an offence is alleged to have been committed it is its bounded duty to\n investigate into the offence and bring the offender to book. Once it\n investigates and finds an offence having been committed it is its duty to\n collect evidence for the purpose of proving the offence. Once that is\n completed and the investigating officer submits report to the court\n requesting the court to take cognizance of the offence under \nSection\n 190\n of the Code its duty comes to an end. On a cognizance of the\n offence being taken by the court the police function of investigation\n comes to an end subject to the provision contained in \nSection 173(8)\n,\n there commences the adjudicatory function of the judiciary to\n determine whether an offence has been committed and if so, whether\n by the person or persons charged with the crime by the police in its\n report to the court, and to award adequate punishment according to\n law for the offence proved to the satisfaction of the court. There is thus\n a well defined and well demarcated function in the field of crime\n detection and its subsequent adjudication between the police and the\n Magistrate. This had been recognised way back in \nKing\n Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad\n [AIR 1944 PC 18 : 1944 LR 71 IA 203,\n 213] where the Privy Council observed as under:\n\n “In India, as has been shown, there is a statutory right on\n the part of the police to investigate the circumstances of an\n alleged cognizable crime without requiring any authority from the\n judicial authorities and it would, as Their Lordships think, be an\n unfortunate result if it should be held possible to interfere with\n those statutory rights by an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction\n of the court. The functions of the judiciary and the police are\n complementary, not overlapping, and the combination of\n individual liberty with a due observance of law and order is only\n to be obtained by leaving each to exercise its own function,\n always, of course, subject to the right of the court to intervene in\n an appropriate case when moved under \nSection 491\n of the\n Criminal Procedure Code to give directions in the nature of\n habeas corpus. In such a case as the present, however, the\n Court's functions begin when a charge is preferred before it, and\n not until then.”\n\n 30\n\n \n26. This view of the Judicial Committee clearly demarcates the\n functions of the executive and the judiciary in the field of detection of\n crime and its subsequent trial and it would appear that the power of the\n police to investigate into a cognizable offence is ordinarily not to be\n interfered with by the judiciary.”\n\n In \nthe said decision\n, this Court also took note of the following\n\nobservations made by this Court in the case of \nS.M. Sharma v. Bipen\n\nKumar Tiwari\n, (1970) 1 SCC 653:\n\n \n“It appears to us that, though the \nCode of Criminal\n Procedure\n gives to the police unfettered power to investigate\n all cases where they suspect that a cognizable offence has\n been committed, in appropriate cases an aggrieved person\n can always seek a remedy by invoking the power of the High\n Court under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution under which, if the\n High Court could be convinced that the power of\n investigation has been exercised by a police officer mala\n fide, the High Court can always issue a writ of mandamus\n restraining the police officer from misusing his legal powers.”\n\n9.2 In the case of \nUnion of India v. Prakash P. Hinduja\n, (2003) 6 SCC\n\n195, in paragraph 20, it is observed and held as under:\n\n \n“20. Thus the legal position is absolutely clear and also settled\n by judicial authorities that the court would not interfere with the\n investigation or during the course of investigation which would mean\n from the time of the lodging of the first information report till the\n submission of the report by the officer in charge of the police station in\n court under \nSection 173(2)\n CrPC, this field being exclusively reserved\n for the investigating agency.”\n\n9.3 In the case of \nBhajan Lal\n (supra), it is observed and held by this\n\nCourt that save in exceptional cases where non interference would result\n\nin miscarriage of justice, the court and the judicial process should not\n\ninterfere at the stage of the investigation of offence.\n It is further\n\n 31\n\n\fobserved that in a routine case where information of an offence or\n\noffences has been lodged, investigation commenced, search and\n\nseizure followed and suspects arrested, the resort to the unusual\n\nprocedure of oral applications and oral appeals and interim stay order\n\nthereon would have the effect of interfering and staying the investigation\n\nof offences by the investigating officer performing statutory duty under\n\nCr.P.C.\n\n9.4 In the case of \nUjjal Kumar Burdhan\n (supra), it is observed and held\n\nby this Court that unless case of gross abuse of power is made out\n\nagainst those in charge of investigation, the High Court should be loath\n\nto interfere at early/premature stage of investigation.\n\n9.5 In the case of \nSatvinder Kaur v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi\n),\n\n(1999) 8 SCC 728, in paragraphs 14 to 16, it is observed and held as\n\nunder:\n\n \n“14. Further, the legal position is well settled that if an offence is\n disclosed the court will not normally interfere with an investigation into\n the case and will permit investigation into the offence alleged to be\n completed. If the FIR, prima facie, discloses the commission of an\n offence, the court does not normally stop the investigation, for, to do so\n would be to trench upon the lawful power of the police to investigate\n into cognizable offences. [\nState of W.B. v. Swapan Kumar Guha\n,\n (1982) 1 SCC 561 : 1982 SCC (Cri) 283] It is also settled by a long\n course of decisions of this Court that for the purpose of exercising its\n power under \nSection 482\n CrPC to quash an FIR or a complaint, the\n High Court would have to proceed entirely on the basis of the\n allegations made in the complaint or the documents accompanying the\n same per se; it has no jurisdiction to examine the correctness or\n\n 32\n\n\fotherwise of the allegations.\n \n[\nPratibha Rani v. Suraj Kumar\n, (1985) 2\nSCC 370, 395 : 1985 SCC (Cri) 180]\n\n 15. Hence, in the present case, the High Court committed a\ngrave error in accepting the contention of the respondent that the\ninvestigating officer had no jurisdiction to investigate the matters on the\nalleged ground that no part of the offence was committed within the\nterritorial jurisdiction of the police station at Delhi. The appreciation of\nthe evidence is the function of the courts when seized of the matter. At\nthe stage of investigation, the material collected by an investigating\nofficer cannot be judicially scrutinized for arriving at a conclusion that\nthe police station officer of a particular police station would not have\nterritorial jurisdiction. In any case, it has to be stated that in view of\n\nSection 178(c)\n of the Criminal Procedure Code, when it is uncertain in\nwhich of the several local areas an offence was committed, or where it\nconsists of several acts done in different local areas, the said offence\ncan be enquired into or tried by a court having jurisdiction over any of\nsuch local areas. Therefore, to say at the stage of investigation that the\nSHO, Police Station Paschim Vihar, New Delhi was not having\nterritorial jurisdiction, is on the face of it, illegal and erroneous. That\napart, \nSection 156(2)\n contains an embargo that no proceeding of a\npolice officer shall be challenged on the ground that he has no\nterritorial power to investigate. The High Court has completely\noverlooked the said embargo when it entertained the petition of\nRespondent 2 on the ground of want of territorial jurisdiction.\n\n \n16. Lastly, it is required to be reiterated that while exercising the\njurisdiction under \nSection 482\n of the Criminal Procedure Code of\nquashing an investigation, the court should bear in mind what has been\nobserved in the \nState of Kerala v. O.C. Kuttan\n [(1999) 2 SCC 651 :\n\n1999 SCC (Cri) 304 : JT (1999) 1 SC 486] to the following effect: (SCC\npp. 654-55, para 6)\n “Having said so, the Court gave a note of caution to the\n effect that the power of quashing the criminal proceedings\n should be exercised very sparingly with circumspection and that\n too in the rarest of rare cases; that the court will not be justified\n in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness\n or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint\n and that the extraordinary or inherent powers do not confer an\n arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or\n caprice. It is too well settled that the first information report is\n only an initiation to move the machinery and to investigate into a\n cognizable offence and, therefore, while exercising the power\n and deciding whether the investigation itself should be quashed,\n utmost care should be taken by the court and at that stage, it is\n\n 33\n\n\f not possible for the court to sift the materials or to weigh the\n materials and then come to the conclusion one way or the other.\n \nIn the case of \nState of U.P. v. O.P. Sharma\n [(1996) 7 SCC 705 :\n 1996 SCC (Cri) 497 : JT (1996) 2 SC 488] a three-Judge Bench\n of this Court indicated that the High Court should be loath to\n interfere at the threshold to thwart the prosecution exercising its\n inherent power under \nSection 482\n or under \nArticles 226\n and \n227\n\n of the Constitution of India, as the case may be, and allow the\n law to take its own course.\n \nThe same view was reiterated by yet\n another three-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of \nRashmi\n Kumar v. Mahesh Kumar Bhada\n [(1997) 2 SCC 397 : 1997 SCC\n (Cri) 415 : JT (1996) 11 SC 175] where this Court sounded a\n word of caution and stated that such power should be sparingly\n and cautiously exercised only when the court is of the opinion\n that otherwise there will be gross miscarriage of justice.\n \nThe\n Court had also observed that social stability and order is\n required to be regulated by proceeding against the offender as it\n is an offence against society as a whole.”\n\n9.6 In the case of \nSupdt. of Police, CBI v. Tapan Kumar Singh\n, (2003)\n\n6 SCC 175 and in the case of \nState of U.P. v. Naresh\n, (2011) 4 SCC\n\n324, it is observed and held by this Court that FIR is not an\n\nencyclopaedia, which must disclose all facts and details relating to the\n\noffence reported.\n \nIn paragraph 20 in the case of \nTapan Kumar Singh\n\n(supra), it is observed and held as under:\n\n 20. It is well settled that a first information report is not an\n encyclopaedia, which must disclose all facts and details relating to the\n offence reported. An informant may lodge a report about the\n commission of an offence though he may not know the name of the\n victim or his assailant. He may not even know how the occurrence took\n place. A first informant need not necessarily be an eyewitness so as to\n be able to disclose in great detail all aspects of the offence committed.\n\n What is of significance is that the information given must disclose the\n commission of a cognizable offence and the information so lodged\n must provide a basis for the police officer to suspect the commission of\n a cognizable offence. At this stage it is enough if the police officer on\n the basis of the information given suspects the commission of a\n\n 34\n\n\f cognizable offence, and not that he must be convinced or satisfied that\n a cognizable offence has been committed. If he has reasons to\n suspect, on the basis of information received, that a cognizable offence\n may have been committed, he is bound to record the information and\n conduct an investigation. At this stage it is also not necessary for him to\n satisfy himself about the truthfulness of the information. It is only after a\n complete investigation that he may be able to report on the truthfulness\n or otherwise of the information. Similarly, even if the information does\n not furnish all the details he must find out those details in the course of\n investigation and collect all the necessary evidence. The information\n given disclosing the commission of a cognizable offence only sets in\n motion the investigative machinery, with a view to collect all necessary\n evidence, and thereafter to take action in accordance with law. \nThe true\n test is whether the information furnished provides a reason to suspect\n the commission of an offence, which the police officer concerned is\n empowered under \nSection 156\n of the Code to investigate. If it does, he\n has no option but to record the information and proceed to investigate\n the case either himself or depute any other competent officer to\n conduct the investigation. The question as to whether the report is true,\n whether it discloses full details regarding the manner of occurrence,\n whether the accused is named, and whether there is sufficient\n evidence to support the allegations are all matters which are alien to\n the consideration of the question whether the report discloses the\n commission of a cognizable offence. Even if the information does not\n give full details regarding these matters, the investigating officer is not\n absolved of his duty to investigate the case and discover the true facts,\n if he can.”\n\n9.7 In the case of \nPrakash P. Hinduja\n (supra), it is observed and held\n\nby this Court that the court would not interfere with the investigation or\n\nduring the course of investigation which would mean from the time of\n\nlodging of the first information report till the submission of the report by\n\nthe officer in charge of the police station in court under \nSection 173(2)\n\nCr.P.C., this field being exclusively reserved for the investigating agency.\n\n9.8 In the case of \nP. Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforcement\n,\n\n(2019) 9 SCC 24, this Court while considering the powers of the\n\n 35\n\n\finvestigating agency to investigate the cognizable offence, has observed\n\nin paragraphs 61, 64 to 67 as under:\n\n “61. The investigation of a cognizable offence and the various\n stages thereon including the interrogation of the accused is exclusively\n reserved for the investigating agency whose powers are unfettered so\n long as the investigating officer exercises his investigating powers well\n within the provisions of the law and the legal bounds. In exercise of its\n inherent power under \nSection 482\n CrPC, the Court can interfere and\n issue appropriate direction only when the Court is convinced that the\n power of the investigating officer is exercised mala fide or where there\n is abuse of power and non-compliance of the provisions of the \nCode of\n Criminal Procedure\n. However, this power of invoking inherent\n jurisdiction to issue direction and interfering with the investigation is\n exercised only in rare cases where there is abuse of process or non-\n compliance of the provisions of the \nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n 64. Investigation into crimes is the prerogative of the police and\n excepting in rare cases, the judiciary should keep out all the areas of\n investigation. \nIn \nState of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma [State of Bihar\n v. P.P.\n Sharma, 1992 Supp (1) SCC 222 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 192] , it was held\n that : (SCC p. 258, para 47)\n “47. … The investigating officer is an arm of the law and\n plays a pivotal role in the dispensation of criminal justice and\n maintenance of law and order. … Enough power is therefore\n given to the police officer in the area of investigating process\n and granting them the court latitude to exercise its discretionary\n power to make a successful investigation….”\n\n 65. \nIn \nDukhishyam Benupani v. Arun Kumar\n Bajoria [Dukhishyam Benupani\n v. Arun Kumar Bajoria, (1998) 1 SCC\n 52 : 1998 SCC (Cri) 261] , this Court held that : (SCC p. 55, para 7)\n\n 36\n\n\f “7. … It is not the function of the court to monitor\n investigation processes so long as such investigation does not\n transgress any provision of law. It must be left to the\n investigating agency to decide the venue, the timings and the\n questions and the manner of putting such questions to persons\n involved in such offences. A blanket order fully insulating a\n person from arrest would make his interrogation a mere\n ritual….”\n\n 66. As held by the Supreme Court in a catena of judgments that\nthere is a well-defined and demarcated function in the field of\ninvestigation and its subsequent adjudication. It is not the function of\nthe court to monitor the investigation process so long as the\ninvestigation does not violate any provision of law. It must be left to the\ndiscretion of the investigating agency to decide the course of\ninvestigation. If the court is to interfere in each and every stage of the\ninvestigation and the interrogation of the accused, it would affect the\nnormal course of investigation. It must be left to the investigating\nagency to proceed in its own manner in interrogation of the accused,\nnature of questions put to him and the manner of interrogation of the\naccused.\n\n 67. It is one thing to say that if the power of investigation has\nbeen exercised by an investigating officer mala fide or non-compliance\nof the provisions of the \nCriminal Procedure Code\n in the conduct of the\ninvestigation, it is open to the court to quash the proceedings where\nthere is a clear case of abuse of power. It is a different matter that the\nHigh Court in exercise of its inherent power under \nSection 482\n CrPC,\ncan always issue appropriate direction at the instance of an aggrieved\nperson if the High Court is convinced that the power of investigation\nhas been exercised by the investigating officer mala fide and not in\naccordance with the provisions of the \nCriminal Procedure Code\n.\n\nHowever, as pointed out earlier that power is to be exercised in rare\ncases where there is a clear abuse of power and non-compliance of\nthe provisions falling under Chapter XII of the \nCode of Criminal\nProcedure\n requiring the interference of the High Court. \nIn the initial\nstages of investigation where the Court is considering the question of\ngrant of regular bail or pre-arrest bail, it is not for the Court to enter into\n\n 37\n\n\f the demarcated function of the investigation and collection of\n evidence/materials for establishing the offence and interrogation of the\n accused and the witnesses.”\n\n9.9 In the recent decision of this Court in the case of \nSkoda Auto\n\nVolkswagen India Private Limited v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n, 2020 SCC\n\nOnLine SC 958, it is observed in paragraph 41 as under:\n\n \n“41. It is needless to point out that ever since the decision of the Privy\n Council in \nKing Emperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmed\n AIR 1945 PC 18, the\n law is well settled that Courts would not thwart any investigation.\n \nIt is\n only in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any kind is\n disclosed in the first information report that the Court will not permit an\n investigation to go on. As cautioned by this Court in \nState of\n Haryana v. Bhajan Lal\n 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, the power of quashing\n should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that\n too in the rarest of rare cases. While examining a complaint, the\n quashing of which is sought, the Court cannot embark upon an enquiry\n as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations\n made in the FIR or in the complaint.\n \nIn \nS.M. Datta v. State of Gujarat\n\n (2001) 7 SCC 659 this Court again cautioned that criminal\n proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage. Quashing of a\n complaint should rather be an exception and a rarity than an ordinary\n rule.\n \nIn \nS.M. Datta\n (supra), this Court held that if a perusal of the first\n information report leads to disclosure of an offence even broadly, law\n courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of the police, since the\n two organs of the State operate in two specific spheres of activities\n and one ought not to tread over the other sphere. “\n\n10. From the aforesaid decisions of this Court, right from the decision\n\nof the Privy Council in the case of \nKhawaja Nazir Ahmad\n (supra), the\n\nfollowing principles of law emerge:\n\ni) Police has the statutory right and duty under the relevant\n\nprovisions of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n contained in Chapter XIV\n\nof the Code to investigate into cognizable offences;\n\n 38\n\n\fii) Courts would not thwart any investigation into the cognizable\n\noffences;\n\niii) However, in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of any\n\nkind is disclosed in the first information report the Court will not permit an\n\ninvestigation to go on;\n\niv) The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with\n\ncircumspection, in the ‘rarest of rare cases’. (The rarest of rare cases\n\nstandard in its application for quashing under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. is not\n\nto be confused with the norm which has been formulated in the context\n\nof the death penalty, as explained previously by this Court);\n\nv) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is sought,\n\nthe court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability or\n\ngenuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR/complaint;\n\nvi) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial stage;\n\nvii) Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception and a rarity\n\nthan an ordinary rule;\n\nviii) Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of\n\nthe police, since the two organs of the State operate in two specific\n\nspheres of activities. The inherent power of the court is, however,\n\n 39\n\n\frecognised to secure the ends of justice or prevent the above of the\n\nprocess by Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\nix) The functions of the judiciary and the police are complementary,\n\nnot overlapping;\n\nx) Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would result in\n\nmiscarriage of justice, the Court and the judicial process should not\n\ninterfere at the stage of investigation of offences;\n\nxi) Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer an\n\narbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its whims or caprice;\n\nxii) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must\n\ndisclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported. Therefore,\n\nwhen the investigation by the police is in progress, the court should not\n\ngo into the merits of the allegations in the FIR. Police must be permitted\n\nto complete the investigation. It would be premature to pronounce the\n\nconclusion based on hazy facts that the complaint/FIR does not deserve\n\nto be investigated or that it amounts to abuse of process of law. During\n\nor after investigation, if the investigating officer finds that there is no\n\nsubstance in the application made by the complainant, the investigating\n\nofficer may file an appropriate report/summary before the learned\n\nMagistrate which may be considered by the learned Magistrate in\n\naccordance with the known procedure;\n\n 40\n\n\fxiii) The power under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. is very wide, but conferment\n\nof wide power requires the court to be cautious. It casts an onerous and\n\nmore diligent duty on the court;\n\nxiv) However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard being\n\nhad to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint imposed by law,\n\nmore particularly the parameters laid down by this Court in the cases of\n\nR.P. Kapur (supra) and Bhajan Lal (supra), has the jurisdiction to quash\n\nthe FIR/complaint; and\n\nxv) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged\n\naccused, the court when it exercises the power under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C., only has to consider whether or not the allegations in the FIR\n\ndisclose the commission of a cognizable offence and is not required to\n\nconsider on merits whether the allegations make out a cognizable\n\noffence or not and the court has to permit the investigating agency/police\n\nto investigate the allegations in the FIR.\n\n11. Whether the High Court would be justified in granting stay of\n\nfurther investigation pending the proceedings under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\n\nbefore it and in what circumstances the High Court would be justified is a\n\nfurther core question to be considered.\n\n Before passing an interim order of staying further investigation\n\npending the quashing petition under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or \nArticle\n\n 41\n\n\f226\n of the Constitution of India, the High Court has to apply the very\n\nparameters which are required to be considered while quashing the\n\nproceedings in exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. in exercise\n\nof its inherent jurisdiction, referred to hereinabove.\n\n12. In a given case, there may be allegations of abuse of process of\n\nlaw by converting a civil dispute into a criminal dispute, only with a view\n\nto pressurise the accused. Similarly, in a given case the complaint itself\n\non the face of it can be said to be barred by law. The allegations in the\n\nFIR/complaint may not at all disclose the commission of a cognizable\n\noffence. In such cases and in exceptional cases with circumspection,\n\nthe High Court may stay the further investigation. However, at the same\n\ntime, there may be genuine complaints/FIRs and the police/investigating\n\nagency has a statutory obligation/right/duty to enquire into the\n\ncognizable offences. Therefore, a balance has to be struck between the\n\nrights of the genuine complainants and the FIRs disclosing commission\n\nof a cognizable offence and the statutory obligation/duty of the\n\ninvestigating agency to investigate into the cognizable offences on the\n\none hand and those innocent persons against whom the criminal\n\nproceedings are initiated which may be in a given case abuse of process\n\nof law and the process. However, if the facts are hazy and the\n\ninvestigation has just begun, the High Court would be circumspect in\n\n 42\n\n\fexercising such powers and the High Court must permit the investigating\n\nagency to proceed further with the investigation in exercise of its\n\nstatutory duty under the provisions of the Code. Even in such a case the\n\nHigh Court has to give/assign brief reasons why at this stage the further\n\ninvestigation is required to be stayed. The High Court must appreciate\n\nthat speedy investigation is the requirement in the criminal administration\n\nof justice.\n\n13. While deprecating the grant of stay of investigation or trial by the\n\nHigh Courts, this Court in the case of \nImtiyaz Ahmad\n (supra), in\n\nparagraphs 25 to 27, held as under:\n\n “25. Unduly long delay has the effect of bringing about blatant\n violation of the rule of law and adverse impact on the common man's\n access to justice. A person's access to justice is a guaranteed\n fundamental right under the Constitution and particularly \nArticle 21.\n\n Denial of this right undermines public confidence in the justice delivery\n system and incentivises people to look for short cuts and other fora\n where they feel that justice will be done quicker. In the long run, this\n also weakens the justice delivery system and poses a threat to the rule\n of law.\n\n 26. It may not be out of place to highlight that access to justice\n must not be understood in a purely quantitative dimension. Access to\n justice in an egalitarian democracy must be understood to mean\n qualitative access to justice as well. Access to justice is, therefore,\n much more than improving an individual's access to courts, or\n guaranteeing representation. It must be defined in terms of ensuring\n that legal and judicial outcomes are just and equitable [see United\n Nations Development Programme, Access to Justice — Practice Note\n (2004)].\n\n 27. The present case discloses the need to reiterate that\n “access to justice” is vital for the rule of law, which by implication\n includes the right of access to an independent judiciary. It is submitted\n\n 43\n\n\f that the stay of investigation or trial for significant periods of time runs\n counter to the principle of rule of law, wherein the rights and aspirations\n of citizens are intertwined with expeditious conclusion of matters. It is\n further submitted that delay in conclusion of criminal matters signifies a\n restriction on the right of access to justice itself, thus amounting to a\n violation of the citizens' rights under the Constitution, in particular under\n Article 21.”\n\n14. A similar view has been expressed by this Court again in the case\n\nof \nAsian Resurfacing of Road Agency Private Limited\n (supra). By\n\ndeprecating the interlocutory orders/stay of criminal proceedings by the\n\nHigh Courts, it is observed by this Court that the stay should not be\n\nconsidered as an incentive to cause delay in the proceedings. It is\n\nfurther observed that order granting stay or extending it must be a\n\nspeaking order and stay not to operate long. It is further observed in \nthe\n\nsaid decision\n that delay in a criminal trial has deleterious effect on the\n\nadministration of justice in which the society has a vital interest; delay in\n\ntrials affects the faith in Rule of Law and efficacy of the legal system; it\n\naffects social welfare and development; mere prima facie case is not\n\nenough; party seeking stay must be put to terms and stay should not be\n\nincentive to delay; the order granting stay must show application of mind;\n\nthe power to grant stay is coupled with accountability. It is further\n\nobserved that wherever stay is granted, a speaking order must be\n\npassed showing that the case was of an exceptional nature.\n\n 44\n\n\f15. As observed hereinabove, there may be some cases where the\n\ninitiation of criminal proceedings may be an abuse of process of law. In\n\nsuch cases, and only in exceptional cases and where it is found that non\n\ninterference would result into miscarriage of justice, the High Court, in\n\nexercise of its inherent powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or \nArticle\n\n226\n of the Constitution of India, may quash the FIR/complaint/criminal\n\nproceedings and even may stay the further investigation. However, the\n\nHigh Court should be slow in interfering the criminal proceedings at the\n\ninitial stage, i.e., quashing petition filed immediately after lodging the\n\nFIR/complaint and no sufficient time is given to the police to investigate\n\ninto the allegations of the FIR/complaint, which is the statutory right/duty\n\nof the police under the provisions of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n.\n\nThere is no denial of the fact that power under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. is\n\nvery wide, but as observed by this Court in catena of decisions, referred\n\nto hereinabove, conferment of wide power requires the court to be more\n\ncautious and it casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court.\n\nTherefore, in exceptional cases, when the High Court deems it fit, regard\n\nbeing had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint imposed\n\nby law, may pass appropriate interim orders, as thought apposite in law,\n\nhowever, the High Court has to give brief reasons which will reflect the\n\napplication of mind by the court to the relevant facts.\n\n 45\n\n\f16. We have come across many orders passed by the High Courts\n\npassing interim orders of stay of arrest and/or “no coercive steps to be\n\ntaken against the accused” in the quashing proceedings under \nSection\n\n482\n Cr.P.C. and/or \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India with assigning\n\nany reasons. We have also come across number of orders passed by\n\nthe High Courts, while dismissing the quashing petitions, of not to arrest\n\nthe accused during the investigation or till the chargesheet/final report\n\nunder \nSection 173\n Cr.P.C is filed. As observed hereinabove, it is the\n\nstatutory right and even the duty of the police to investigate into the\n\ncognizable offence and collect the evidence during the course of\n\ninvestigation. There may be requirement of a custodial investigation for\n\nwhich the accused is required to be in police custody (popularly known\n\nas remand). Therefore, passing such type of blanket interim orders\n\nwithout assigning reasons, of not to arrest and/or “no coercive steps”\n\nwould hamper the investigation and may affect the statutory right/duty of\n\nthe police to investigate the cognizable offence conferred under the\n\nprovisions of the \nCr.P.C\n. Therefore, such a blanket order is not justified\n\nat all. The order of the High Court must disclose reasons why it has\n\npassed an ad-interim direction during the pendency of the proceedings\n\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. Such reasons, however brief must disclose\n\nan application of mind.\n\n 46\n\nThe aforesaid is required to be considered from another angle\n\nalso. Granting of such blanket order would not only adversely affect the\n\ninvestigation but would have far reaching implications for maintaining the\n\nRule of Law. Where the investigation is stayed for a long time, even if\n\nthe stay is ultimately vacated, the subsequent investigation may not be\n\nvery fruitful for the simple reason that the evidence may no longer be\n\navailable. Therefore, in case, the accused named in the FIR/complaint\n\napprehends his arrest, he has a remedy to apply for anticipatory bail\n\nunder \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. and on the conditions of grant of anticipatory\n\nbail under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C being satisfied, he may be released on\n\nanticipatory bail by the competent court. Therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat the accused is remediless. It cannot be disputed that the\n\nanticipatory bail under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. can be granted on the\n\nconditions prescribed under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. are satisfied. At the\n\nsame time, it is to be noted that arrest is not a must whenever an FIR of\n\na cognizable offence is lodged. Still in case a person is apprehending\n\nhis arrest in connection with an FIR disclosing cognizable offence, as\n\nobserved hereinabove, he has a remedy to apply for anticipatory bail\n\nunder \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. As observed by this Court in the case of\n\nHema Mishra v. State of Uttar Pradesh\n, (2014) 4 SCC 453, though the\n\nHigh Courts have very wide powers under \nArticle 226\n, the powers under\n\nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India are to be exercised to prevent\n\n 47\n\n\fmiscarriage of justice and to prevent abuse of process of law by the\n\nauthorities indiscriminately making pre-arrest of the accused persons. It\n\nis further observed that in entertaining such a petition under \nArticle 226\n,\n\nthe High Court is supposed to balance the two interests. On the one\n\nhand, the Court is to ensure that such a power under \nArticle 226\n is not to\n\nbe exercised liberally so as to convert it into \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C.\n\nproceedings. It is further observed that on the other hand whenever the\n\nHigh Court finds that in a given case if the protection against pre-arrest\n\nis not given, it would amount to gross miscarriage of justice and no case,\n\nat all, is made for arrest pending trial, the High Court would be free to\n\ngrant the relief in the nature of anticipatory bail in exercise of its powers\n\nunder \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India, keeping in mind that this\n\npower has to be exercised sparingly in those cases where it is absolutely\n\nwarranted and justified. However, such a blanket interim order of not to\n\narrest or “no coercive steps” cannot be passed mechanically and in a\n\nroutine manner.\n\n17. So far as the order of not to arrest and/or “no coercive steps” till\n\nthe final report/chargesheet is filed and/or during the course of\n\ninvestigation or not to arrest till the investigation is completed, passed\n\nwhile dismissing the quashing petitions under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or\n\nunder \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India and having opined that no\n\n 48\n\n\fcase is made out to quash the FIR/complaint is concerned, the same is\n\nwholly impermissible.\n\n18. This Court in the case of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra), as such,\n\ndeprecated such practice/orders passed by the High Courts, directing\n\npolice not to arrest, even while declining to interfere with the quashing\n\npetition in exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. In the aforesaid\n\ncase before this Court, the High Court dismissed the petition filed under\n\nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR. However, while dismissing the\n\nquashing petition, the High Court directed the police not to arrest the\n\npetitioners during the pendency of the investigation. While setting aside\n\nsuch order, it is observed by this Court that such direction amounts to an\n\norder under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C., albeit without satisfaction of the\n\nconditions of the said provision and the same is legally unacceptable. In\n\nthe aforesaid decision, it is specifically observed and held by this Court\n\nthat “it is absolutely inconceivable and unthinkable to pass an order\n\ndirecting the police not to arrest till the investigation is completed while\n\ndeclining to interfere or expressing opinion that it is not appropriate to\n\nstay the investigation”. It is further observed that this kind of order is\n\nreally inappropriate and unseemly and it has no sanction in law. It is\n\nfurther observed that the courts should oust and obstruct unscrupulous\n\nlitigants from invoking the inherent jurisdiction of the Court on the drop of\n\n 49\n\n\fa hat to file an application for quashing of launching an FIR or\n\ninvestigation and then seek relief by an interim order. It is further\n\nobserved that it is the obligation of the court to keep such unprincipled\n\nand unethical litigants at bay.\n\n In the aforesaid decision, this Court has further deprecated the\n\norders passed by the High Courts, while dismissing the applications\n\nunder \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. to the effect that if the petitioner-accused\n\nsurrenders before the trial Magistrate, he shall be admitted to bail on\n\nsuch terms and conditions as deemed fit and appropriate to be imposed\n\nby the Magistrate concerned. It is observed that such orders are de\n\nhors the powers conferred under \nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. That thereafter,\n\nthis Court in paragraph 25 has observed as under:\n\n “25. Having reminded the same, presently we can only say that the\n types of orders like the present one, are totally unsustainable, for it is\n contrary to the aforesaid settled principles and judicial precedents. It is\n intellectual truancy to avoid the precedents and issue directions which\n are not in consonance with law. It is the duty of a Judge to sustain the\n judicial balance and not to think of an order which can cause trauma to\n the process of adjudication. It should be borne in mid that the culture of\n adjudication is stabilised when intellectual discipline is maintained and\n further when such discipline constantly keeps guard on the mind.”\n\n19. We are at pains to note that despite the law \nlaid down by\n this Court\n\nin the case of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra), deprecating such orders\n\npassed by the High Courts of not to arrest during the pendency of the\n\ninvestigation, even when the quashing petitions under \nSection 482\n\n \n50\n\n\fCr.P.C. or \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India are dismissed, even\n\nthereafter also, many High Courts are passing such orders. The law\n\ndeclared/laid down by this Court is binding on all the High Courts and not\n\nfollowing the law \nlaid down by\n this Court would have a very serious\n\nimplications in the administration of justice.\n\n20. \nIn the recent decision of this Court in the case of \nRavuri Krishna\n\nMurthy\n (supra), this bench set aside the similar order passed by the\n\nAndhra Pradesh High Court of granting a blanket order of protection\n\nfrom arrest, even after coming to the conclusion that no case for\n\nquashing was established. The High Court while disposing of the\n\nquashing petition and while refusing to quash the criminal proceedings in\n\nexercise of powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. directed to complete the\n\ninvestigation into the crime without arresting the second petitioner – A2\n\nand file a final report, if any, in accordance with law. The High Court also\n\nfurther passed an order that the second petitioner – A2 to appear before\n\nthe investigating agency as and when required and cooperate with the\n\ninvestigating agency.\n \nAfter considering the decision of this Court in the\n\ncase of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra), this Court set aside the order\n\npassed by the High Court restraining the investigating officer from\n\narresting the second accused.\n\n 51\n\nThus, it has been found that despite absolute proposition of law\n\nlaid down by\n this Court in the case of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra) that\n\nsuch a blanket order of not to arrest till the investigation is completed\n\nand the final report is filed, passed while declining to quash the criminal\n\nproceedings in exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C, as\n\nobserved hereinabove, the High Courts have continued to pass such\n\norders.\n \nTherefore, we again reiterate the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in\n\nthe case of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra) and we direct all the High\n\nCourts to scrupulously follow the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in the case\n\nof \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra) and the law \nlaid down by\n this Court in\n\nthe present case, which otherwise the High Courts are bound to follow.\n\nWe caution the High Courts again against passing such orders of not to\n\narrest or “no coercive steps to be taken” till the investigation is\n\ncompleted and the final report is filed, while not entertaining quashing\n\npetitions under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution\n\nof India.\n\n21. Now so far as the legality of the impugned interim order passed by\n\nthe High Court directing the investigating agency/police “not to adopt any\n\ncoercive steps” against the accused is concerned, for the reasons stated\n\nhereinbelow, the same is unsustainable:\n\n 52\n\n\fi) that such a blanket interim order passed by the High Court affects\n\nthe powers of the investigating agency to investigate into the cognizable\n\noffences, which otherwise is a statutory right/duty of the police under the\n\nrelevant provisions of the \nCr.P.C\n.;\n\nii) that the interim order is a cryptic order;\n\niii) that no reasons whatsoever have been assigned by the High\n\nCourt, while passing such a blanket order of “no coercive steps to be\n\nadopted” by the police;\n\niv) that it is not clear what the High Court meant by passing the order\n\nof “not to adopt any coercive steps”, as it is clear from the impugned\n\ninterim order that it was brought to the notice of the High Court that so\n\nfar as the accused are concerned, they are already protected by the\n\ninterim protection granted by the learned Sessions Court, and therefore\n\nthere was no further reason and/or justification for the High Court to pass\n\nsuch an interim order of “no coercive steps to be adopted”. If the High\n\nCourt meant by passing such an interim order of “no coercive steps”\n\ndirecting the investigating agency/police not to further investigate\n, \nin that\n\ncase\n, such a blanket order without assigning any reasons whatsoever\n\nand without even permitting the investigating agency to further\n\ninvestigate into the allegations of the cognizable offence is otherwise\n\nunsustainable. It has affected the right of the investigating agency to\n\n 53\n\n\finvestigate into the cognizable offences. While passing such a blanket\n\norder, the High Court has not indicated any reasons.\n\n21.1 As observed and held by this Court in the case of \nSpecial Director\n\nv. Mohd. Ghulam Ghouse\n, (2004) 3 SCC 440 that though, while passing\n\ninterim orders, it is not necessary to elaborately deal with the merits, it is\n\ncertainly desirable and proper for the High Court to indicate the reasons\n\nwhich have weighed with it in granting such an extraordinary relief in the\n\nform of an interim protection.\n\n21.2 In the case of Nitco Tiles Ltd. v. Gujarat Ceramic Floor Tiles Mfg.\n\nAssociation, (2005) 12 SCC 454, it is observed and held by this Court\n\nthat when an interim order should, particularly when that order may be\n\nimpugned before the higher authority/Forum, contain reasons, however\n\nbrief, in support of the grant or refusal thereof. It is further observed that\n\nin the absence of such reasons, it is virtually impossible for such higher\n\nauthority/Forum to determine what persuaded the grant or refusal of\n\nrelief.\n\n21.3 In the case of \nHindustan Times Limited v. Union of India\n, (1998) 2\n\nSCC 242, while emphasising on giving reasons by the High Court, it is\n\nobserved that necessity to provide reasons, howsoever brief, in support\n\nof the High Court’s conclusions is too obvious to be reiterated.\n\nObligation to give reasons introduces clarity and excludes or at any rate\n\n 54\n\n\fminimises the changes of arbitrariness and the higher forum can test the\n\ncorrectness of those reasons.\n\n21.4 While considering the importance of the reasons to be given during\n\nthe decision-making process, in the case of \nKranti Associates (P) Ltd. v.\n\nMasood Ahmed\n, (2010) 9 SCC 496, in paragraph 47, this Court has\n\nsummarised as under:\n\n “47. Summarising the above discussion, this Court holds:\n\n (a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons, even\n in administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone prejudicially.\n\n (b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its\n conclusions.\n\n (c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider\n principle of justice that justice must not only be done it must also appear to\n be done as well.\n\n (d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any\n possible arbitrary exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even\n administrative power.\n\n (e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the\n decision-maker on relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous\n considerations.\n\n (f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a\n decision-making process as observing principles of natural justice by\n judicial, quasi-judicial and even by administrative bodies.\n\n (g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior courts.\n\n (h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of law\n and constitutional governance is in favour of reasoned decisions based on\n relevant facts. This is virtually the lifeblood of judicial decision-making\n justifying the principle that reason is the soul of justice.\n\n (i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as\n different as the judges and authorities who deliver them. All these\n decisions serve one common purpose which is to demonstrate by reason\n that the relevant factors have been objectively considered. This is\n important for sustaining the litigants' faith in the justice delivery system.\n\n (j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability\n and transparency.\n\n (k) If a judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough about\n his/her decision-making process then it is impossible to know whether the\n\n 55\n\n\f person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to principles of\n incrementalism.\n\n (l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and succinct.\n\n A pretence of reasons or “rubber-stamp reasons” is not to be equated with\n a valid decision-making process.\n\n (m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of\n restraint on abuse of judicial powers. Transparency in decision-making not\n only makes the judges and decision-makers less prone to errors but also\n makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in Defence of\n Judicial Candor [(1987) 100 Harvard Law Review 731-37] .)\n\n (n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the broad\n doctrine of fairness in decision-making, the said requirement is now\n virtually a component of human rights and was considered part of\n Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See Ruiz Torija v. Spain [(1994) 19 EHRR 553]\n EHRR, at 562 para 29 and Anya v. University of Oxford [2001 EWCA Civ\n 405 (CA)] , wherein the Court referred to \nArticle 6\n of the European\n Convention of Human Rights which requires,\n “adequate and intelligent reasons must be given for judicial decisions”.\n\n (o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in setting\n up precedents for the future. Therefore, for development of law,\n requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the essence and is\n virtually a part of “due process”.”\n\n Therefore, even while passing such an interim order, in exceptional\n\ncases with caution and circumspection, the High Court has to give brief\n\nreasons why it is necessary to pass such an interim order, more\n\nparticularly when the High Court is exercising the extraordinary and\n\ninherent powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of\n\nthe Constitution of India. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case, the High Court has committed a grave error of law and also of\n\nfacts in passing such an interim order of “no coercive steps to be\n\nadopted” and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\nCriminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 4961 of 2021\n\n 56\n\n\f22. Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 4961 of 2021 has been\n\npreferred by respondent nos. 2 to 4 herein – original accused under\n\nSection 340\n r/w \nSection 195 (1)(B)\n, Cr.P.C. for initiating action against\n\nthe appellant. It is alleged that the appellant has suppressed the vital\n\ndocuments/agreements and the facts and by suppressing the material\n\ndocuments/agreements and the facts has obtained an interim order\n\ndated 12.10.2020 from this Court, staying order dated 28.09.2020\n\npassed by the High Court.\n\n Number of submissions and counter submissions have been made\n\nby the learned counsel for the respective parties. However, considering\n\nthe fact that the quashing petition is yet to be considered by the High\n\nCourt on merits, we do not propose to entertain the present application\n\nand enter into the merits of the allegations in the present application.\n\nHowever, it will sufficed to say that this Court has passed an interim\n\norder dated 12.10.2020, staying order dated 28.09.2020 passed by the\n\nHigh Court, by giving brief reasons and even if the\n\ndocuments/agreements which are alleged to have been suppressed\n\nwould have been there, it would not have any bearing on the interim\n\norder passed by this Court. What is weighed while passing interim order\n\ndated 12.10.2020 is very clear from the interim order dated 12.10.2020.\n\n 57\n\n\fTherefore, we close the criminal miscellaneous petition No. 4961/2021\n\nand consequently the same stands disposed of.\n\nConclusions:\n\n23. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, our final\n\nconclusions on the principal/core issue, whether the High Court would be\n\njustified in passing an interim order of stay of investigation and/or “no\n\ncoercive steps to be adopted”, during the pendency of the quashing\n\npetition under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\nConstitution of India and in what circumstances and whether the High\n\nCourt would be justified in passing the order of not to arrest the accused\n\nor “no coercive steps to be adopted” during the investigation or till the\n\nfinal report/chargesheet is filed under \nSection 173\n Cr.P.C., while\n\ndismissing/disposing of/not entertaining/not quashing the criminal\n\nproceedings/complaint/FIR in exercise of powers under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India, our final\n\nconclusions are as under:\n\n 58\n\n\fi) Police has the statutory right and duty under the relevant\n\nprovisions of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure\n contained in Chapter\n\nXIV of the Code to investigate into a cognizable offence;\n\nii) Courts would not thwart any investigation into the cognizable\n\noffences;\n\niii) It is only in cases where no cognizable offence or offence of\n\nany kind is disclosed in the first information report that the Court\n\nwill not permit an investigation to go on;\n\niv) The power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with\n\ncircumspection, as it has been observed, in the ‘rarest of rare\n\ncases (not to be confused with the formation in the context of death\n\npenalty).\n\nv) While examining an FIR/complaint, quashing of which is\n\nsought, the court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the\n\nreliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in\n\nthe FIR/complaint;\n\nvi) Criminal proceedings ought not to be scuttled at the initial\n\nstage;\n\nvii) Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather\n\nthan an ordinary rule;\n\nviii) Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the\n\njurisdiction of the police, since the two organs of the State operate\n\n 59\n\n\fin two specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over\n\nthe other sphere;\n\nix) The functions of the judiciary and the police are\n\ncomplementary, not overlapping;\n\nx) Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would\n\nresult in miscarriage of justice, the Court and the judicial process\n\nshould not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences;\n\nxi) Extraordinary and inherent powers of the Court do not confer\n\nan arbitrary jurisdiction on the Court to act according to its whims\n\nor caprice;\n\nxii) The first information report is not an encyclopaedia which\n\nmust disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported.\n\nTherefore, when the investigation by the police is in progress, the\n\ncourt should not go into the merits of the allegations in the FIR.\n\nPolice must be permitted to complete the investigation. It would be\n\npremature to pronounce the conclusion based on hazy facts that\n\nthe complaint/FIR does not deserve to be investigated or that it\n\namounts to abuse of process of law. After investigation, if the\n\ninvestigating officer finds that there is no substance in the\n\napplication made by the complainant, the investigating officer may\n\nfile an appropriate report/summary before the learned Magistrate\n\n 60\n\n\fwhich may be considered by the learned Magistrate in accordance\n\nwith the known procedure;\n\nxiii) The power under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. is very wide, but\n\nconferment of wide power requires the court to be more cautious. It\n\ncasts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court;\n\nxiv) However, at the same time, the court, if it thinks fit, regard\n\nbeing had to the parameters of quashing and the self-restraint\n\nimposed by law, more particularly the parameters laid down by this\n\nCourt in the cases of \nR.P. Kapur\n (supra) and \nBhajan Lal\n (supra), has\n\nthe jurisdiction to quash the FIR/complaint;\n\nxv) When a prayer for quashing the FIR is made by the alleged\n\naccused and the court when it exercises the power under \nSection\n\n482\n Cr.P.C., only has to consider whether the allegations in the FIR\n\ndisclose commission of a cognizable offence or not. The court is\n\nnot required to consider on merits whether or not the merits of the\n\nallegations make out a cognizable offence and the court has to\n\npermit the investigating agency/police to investigate the allegations\n\nin the FIR;\n\nxvi) The aforesaid parameters would be applicable and/or the\n\naforesaid aspects are required to be considered by the High Court\n\nwhile passing an interim order in a quashing petition in exercise of\n\npowers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the\n\n 61\n\n\fConstitution of India. However, an interim order of stay of\n\ninvestigation during the pendency of the quashing petition can be\n\npassed with circumspection. Such an interim order should not\n\nrequire to be passed routinely, casually and/or mechanically.\n\nNormally, when the investigation is in progress and the facts are\n\nhazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High Court,\n\nthe High Court should restrain itself from passing the interim order\n\nof not to arrest or “no coercive steps to be adopted” and the\n\naccused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under\n\nSection 438\n Cr.P.C. before the competent court. The High Court\n\nshall not and as such is not justified in passing the order of not to\n\narrest and/or “no coercive steps” either during the investigation or\n\ntill the investigation is completed and/or till the final\n\nreport/chargesheet is filed under \nSection 173\n Cr.P.C., while\n\ndismissing/disposing of the quashing petition under \nSection 482\n\nCr.P.C. and/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India.\n\nxvii) Even in a case where the High Court is prima facie of the\n\nopinion that an exceptional case is made out for grant of interim\n\nstay of further investigation, after considering the broad\n\nparameters while exercising the powers under \nSection 482\n Cr.P.C.\n\nand/or under \nArticle 226\n of the Constitution of India referred to\n\nhereinabove, the High Court has to give brief reasons why such an\n\n 62\n\n\finterim order is warranted and/or is required to be passed so that it\n\ncan demonstrate the application of mind by the Court and the\n\nhigher forum can consider what was weighed with the High Court\n\nwhile passing such an interim order.\n\nxviii) Whenever an interim order is passed by the High Court of “no\n\ncoercive steps to be adopted” within the aforesaid parameters, the\n\nHigh Court must clarify what does it mean by “no coercive steps to\n\nbe adopted” as the term “no coercive steps to be adopted” can be\n\nsaid to be too vague and/or broad which can be misunderstood\n\nand/or misapplied.\n\n24. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the present\n\nappeal succeeds. The impugned interim order/direction contained in\n\nclause (d) of the impugned interim order dated 28.09.2020 by which the\n\nHigh Court has directed that “no coercive measures to be adopted”\n\nagainst the petitioners (respondent nos. 2 to 4 herein) in respect of FIR\n\nNo. 367/2019 dated 19.09.2019, registered at Worli Police Station,\n\nMumbai, Maharashtra (subsequently transferred to Economic Offence\n\nWing, Unit IX, Mumbai, renumbered as C.R. No. 82/2019) is hereby\n\nquashed and set aside. However, it is made clear that we have not\n\nexpressed anything on the merits of the case, more particularly the\n\nallegations in the FIR and the High Court to consider the quashing\n\n 63\n\n\fpetition in accordance with law and on its own merits and considering\n\nthe afore-stated observations made by this Court in the present\n\njudgment.\n\n25. Having regard to the fact that despite the law \nlaid down by\n this\n\nCourt in the case of \nHabib Abdullah Jeelani\n (supra) and other decisions,\n\nreferred to hereinabove, some High Courts have continued to pass such\n\ninterim orders, we direct the Registry to forward a copy of this judgment\n\nto all the High Courts to be placed before Hon’ble the Chief Justice to\n\ncirculate to all the Judges of the High Courts.\n\n ……………………………………..J.\n [Dr. Dhananjaya Y.

Investigation of an\n offence is the field exclusively reserved for the executive through the\n police department the superintendence over which vests in the State\n Government. The executive which is charged with a duty to keep\n vigilance over law and order situation is obliged to prevent crime and if\n an offence is alleged to have been committed it is its bounded duty to\n investigate into the offence and bring the offender to book. Once it\n investigates and finds an offence having been committed it is its duty to\n collect evidence for the purpose of proving the offence. Once that is\n completed and the investigating officer submits report to the court\n requesting the court to take cognizance of the offence under \nSection\n 190\n of the Code its duty comes to an end. On a cognizance of the\n offence being taken by the court the police function of investigation\n comes to an end subject to the provision contained in \nSection 173(8)\n,\n there commences the adjudicatory function of the judiciary to\n determine whether an offence has been committed and if so, whether\n by the person or persons charged with the crime by the police in its\n report to the court, and to award adequate punishment according to\n law for the offence proved to the satisfaction of the court. There is thus\n a well defined and well demarcated function in the field of crime\n detection and its subsequent adjudication between the police and the\n Magistrate.
