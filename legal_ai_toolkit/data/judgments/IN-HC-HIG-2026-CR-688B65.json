Applicant\n\nVersus\n\n1. The State of Maharashtra,\nThrough Superintendent of Police,\nAurangabad, Dist. Aurangabad.\n\n2. Police Inspector,\nPolice Station Shillegaon,\nTq. Gangapur, Dist. Aurangabad.\n\n3. Bhanudas S/o Fakirrao Ghitre\nAge : 50 Years, Occu : Teacher,\nR/o: Flat No.3, First Avenue,\nJalannagar, Railway Station,\nAurangabad. ... Respondents\n[R.No.3 is original\naccused No.1]\n\n.....\nMr. D. R. Shelke, Advocate for the Applicant.\nMr. S. G. Sangle, APP for Respondent Nos. 1 and 2-State.\nDr. Anagha N. Pedgaonkar, Advocate for Respondent No.3.\n.....\n\nCORAM : ABHAY S. WAGHWASE, J.\nReserved on : 12.01.2026\nPronounced on : 13.01.2026\nACB-63-2025\n-2-\n\nORDER :\n\n1. Instant application by original informant is for cancellation of\n\nbail granted to present respondent no.3 by order dated 7.02.2025 in\n\nBail Application No. 26 of 2025 in consequence to registration of\n\ncrime no. 0193 of 2023 registered at Shillegaon Police Station,\n\nDistrict Aurangabad, for offence under\nSections 302\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\nof IPC.\n\n2. Taking this Court through the FIR and papers, learned counsel\n\nfor applicant/informant would submit that applicant is seeking\n\ncancellation of bail granted to main accused Bhanudas, against whom\n\nthere are allegations of overt act by hitting an uprooted iron pole i.e.\n\nin assaulting deceased who allegedly suffered instant death. Learned\n\ncounsel took this Court through the postmortem report and more\n\nparticularly column no. 19 and would highlight the impact of the\n\nassault. He would point out that offence was serious. That, main role\n\nwas attributed to accused respondent no.3. That, this Court had\n\ngranted bail on the ground of other accused to be on bail and on\n\naccount of incarceration for more than one and half years. He would\n\npoint out that, recently law has been settled that in cases of serious\n\nnature, this Court can cancel bail even if it was granted and that,\n\nground of long incarceration is no good ground to extend the benefit\nACB-63-2025\n\n-3-\n\nof bail. He pointed out that, considerations for grant of bail were not\n\ntaken into account by this Court. That, there was no medical reason\n\nsupported by any material to extend the benefit. Consequently it is his\n\nsubmission that, going by the gravity of the offence, respondent being\n\nmain accused and being solely responsible for causing death, he was\n\nnot entitled for bail. In support of above submissions, Learned counsel\n\nseeks reliance on the judgment of Ajwar v. Wasim and another (2024)\n\n10 SCC 768, State of Karnataka v. Sri Darshan Etc. 2025 SCC OnLine\n\nSC 1702 and Anil Kumar Yadav v. State (NCT of Delhi) and another\n\n(2018) 12 SCC 129.\n\n3. Learned APP also joined in urging this Court to cancel the bail\n\nand he too would point out that, serious offence is committed. That,\n\nprior to the occurrence, application was forwarded to police for\n\nextending police protection and tt is part of papers. Even according to\n\nhim, main role is attributed to accused/present respondent no.3 for\n\nassaulting deceased with article like iron pipe which he allegedly took\n\nover from another accused who had uprooted it. He pointed out that\n\nthere is video-graph as well as its panchanama on record and thus he\n\nsubmits that, with serious allegations, respondent no.3 was not\n\nentitled for benefit of bail. He further submitted that respondent is\n\nalso not attending trial court.\n\nACB-63-2025\n\n-4-\n\n4. Per contra, learned counsel for respondent no.3 would take this\n\nCourt through the order passed by this Court while granting bail and\n\nwould submit that, after considering the submissions and papers, this\n\nCourt had granted bail on merits. According to her, it is fairly settled\n\nposition that bail once granted cannot be withdrawn. She urges to\n\ntake into account the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case\n\nof Dolat Ram and ors. v. State of Haryana (1995) 1 SCC 349 and\n\nlastly would submit that there are no circumstances whatsoever for\n\nwithdrawing the benefit of bail granted earlier. She further submitted\n\nthat, now charges are already framed and case is awaiting trial.\n\n5. Present application is for cancellation of bail granted by this\n\nCourt by order dated 07.02.2025 in Bail Application No. 26 of 2025.\n\nIt seems that even at that time prosecution had opposed grant of bail\n\non the grounds that offence is under\nSection 302\nIPC and there is\n\nindependent eye witness account regarding assault by present\n\nrespondent. This court has also taken into account the submission of\n\nthe then learned APP that there was video-graph of the occurrence.\n\nThis Court had heard both sides and had made discussion in para 4 of\n\nthe order. This court had noted that when the process of\n\nmeasurement was in progress on 26.06.2023, alleged incident had\n\ntaken place. This Court had also noted that Dnyaneshwar had\nACB-63-2025\n\n-5-\n\nuprooted the pole/angle and after he handed it over to present\n\nrespondent no.3, the same was put to use by inflicting blow on the\n\nhead of deceased as a result of which, he died. This Court in previous\n\norder had visited the postmortem report and had noted about\n\nprobable cause of death to be complications following head injury.\n\nPrimarily this Court had noted that applicant was behind bars since\n\n22.07.2023 i.e. since almost one and half years, and it was also noted\n\nthat it was not pointed out to this Court that there were immediate\n\nprospects about matter going for trial. At that time, submissions were\n\nmade across the bar that by that day, even charges were not framed.\n\nSuch factors cumulatively prevailed over this Court for granting bail\n\nby imposing conditions.\n\n6. Now, above order granting bail is sought to be cancelled.\n\nHowever, while advancing the arguments, it is noticed that again\n\ngrounds/points of merits of the case are tried to be re-agitated by the\n\noriginal complainant. There are no accusations of misuse of liberty\n\nnor any supervening circumstances are brought to the notice of this\n\nCourt so as to recall the order of grant of bail.\n\n7. Law is fairly settled that bail once granted cannot be withdrawn\n\nunless in exceptional cases. Law to this extent has been dealt in the\n\ncase of Dolat Ram (supra).\nVery recently also, the Hon'ble Apex Court\nACB-63-2025\n\n-6-\n\nin the case of Abhimanue v. State of Kerla 2025 INSC 1136 has\n\nelaborately discussed the judicial precedent on cancellation of bail\n\nincluding the three Judge Bench judgment in the case of\nP. v. State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n(2022) 15 SCC 211 wherein there is discussion on\n\nthe aspect of revocation of bail once granted. In the said case, the\n\nKerala High Court had cancelled the bail of five out of the ten accused\n\ntherein, and in appeal, the Hon'ble Apex Court has set aside the said\n\norder of Kerala High Court by leaning in favour of liberty rather than\n\nits curtailment.\n\nSimilar views are echoed in another judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court in the case of\nShaikh Irshad @ Monu v. State of\n\nMaharashtra\nreported in 2025 LiveLaw (SC) 1185.\nIn the case of X v.\n\nState of Bihar and Ors. MANU/SC/0959/2025, in para 23, the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court has made following observations;\n\n\"23. Recently, this Court in the case of Shabeen Ahmad v. The\nState of Uttar Pradesh and Anr. MANU/SC/0301/2025 :\n\n2025:INSC:307 : (2025) 4 SCC 172 while placing reliance\nupon the case of Ajwar v. Waseem MANU/SC/0462/2024 :\n2024:INSC:438 : (2024) 10 SCC 768 cancelled the bail\ngranted to the Accused in a dowry death case observing as\nfollows:\n\n18.... A superficial application of bail parameters not\nonly undermines the gravity of the offence itself but\nalso risks weakening public faith in the judiciary's\nresolve to combat the menace of dowry deaths. It is\nthis very perception of justice, both within and outside\nACB-63-2025\n\n-7-\n\nthe courtroom, that courts must safeguard, lest we risk\nnormalizing a crime that continues to claim numerous\ninnocent lives. These observations regarding grant of\nbail in grievous crimes were thoroughly dealt with by\nthis Court in\nAjwar v. Waseem\nin the following paras:\n\n26 . While considering as to whether bail ought to be\ngranted in a matter involving a serious criminal\noffence, the Court must consider relevant factors like\nthe nature of the accusations made against the\nAccused, the manner in which the crime is alleged to\nhave been committed, the gravity of the offence, the\nrole attributed to the Accused, the criminal antecedents\nof the Accused, the probability of tampering of the\nwitnesses and repeating the offence, if the Accused are\nreleased on bail, the likelihood of the Accused being\nunavailable in the event bail is granted, the possibility\nof obstructing the proceedings and evading the courts\nof justice and the overall desirability of releasing the\nAccused on bail. [Refer:\nChaman Lal v. State of U.P.\n[Chaman Lal\nv. State of U.P., [ MANU/SC/0631/2004 :\n\n2004:INSC:451 : (2004) 7 SCC 525];\nKalyan Chandra\nSarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan [ MANU/SC/0214/2004\n:\n\n(2004) 7 SCC 528]; Masroor v. State of U.P. [\nMANU/SC/0683/2009 : 2009:INSC:613 : (2009) 14\nSCC 286];\nPrasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee\n[ MANU/SC/0916/2010\n: 2010:INSC:752 : (2010) 14\nSCC 496]; Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P. [\nMANU/SC/1208/2014 : 2014:INSC:841 : (2014) 16\nSCC 508];\nAnil Kumar Yadav v. State (NCT of Delhi)\n[ MANU/SC/1454/2017\n: 2017:INSC:1111 : (2018) 12\nSCC 129]; Mahipal v. Rajesh Kumar [\nMANU/SC/1677/2019 : 2019:INSC:1325 : (2020) 2\nSCC 118].\n\n27. It is equally well settled that bail once granted,\nought not to be cancelled in a mechanical manner.\nHowever, an unreasoned or perverse order of bail is\nACB-63-2025\n\n-8-\n\nalways open to interference by the superior court. If\nthere are serious allegations against the Accused, even\nif he has not misused the bail granted to him, such an\norder can be cancelled by the same Court that has\ngranted the bail. Bail can also be revoked by a superior\ncourt if it transpires that the courts below have ignored\nthe relevant material available on 12-01-2026 (Page 5\nof 7)record or not looked into the gravity of the offence\nor the impact on the society resulting in such an order.\nIn P v. State of M.P. [MANU/SC/0587/2022 :\n\n2022:INSC:514 : (2022) 15 SCC 211] decided by a\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court [authored by one of us\n(Hima Kohli, J.)] has spelt out the considerations that\nmust weigh with the Court for interfering in an order\ngranting bail to an Accused Under\nSection 439(1)\nCode\nof Criminal Procedure in the following words:\n\n(SCC p. 224, para 24)\n\n24 . As can be discerned from the above decisions, for\ncancelling bail once granted, the court must consider\nwhether any supervening circumstances have arisen or\nthe conduct of the Accused post grant of bail\ndemonstrates that it is no longer conducive to a fair\ntrial to permit him to retain his freedom by enjoying\nthe concession of bail during trial [Dolat Ram v. State\nof Haryana, MANU/SC/0547/1995 : 1994:INSC:548 :\n\n(1995) 1 SCC 349]. To put it differently, in ordinary\ncircumstances, this Court would be loathe to interfere\nwith an order passed by the court below granting bail\nbut if such an order is found to be illegal or perverse or\npremised on material that is irrelevant, then such an\norder is susceptible to scrutiny and interference by the\nappellate court.\n\nConsiderations for setting aside bail orders\n\n28. The considerations that weigh with the appellate\ncourt for setting aside the bail order on an application\nACB-63-2025\n\n-9-\n\nbeing moved by the aggrieved party include any\nsupervening circumstances that may have occurred\nafter granting relief to the Accused, the conduct of the\nAccused while on bail, any attempt on the part of the\nAccused to procrastinate, resulting in delaying the trial,\nany instance of threats being extended to the witnesses\nwhile on bail, any attempt on the part of the Accused\nto tamper with the evidence in any manner. We may\nadd that this list is only illustrative and not exhaustive.\nHowever, the court must be cautious that at the stage\nof granting bail, only a prima facie case needs to be\nexamined and detailed reasons relating to the merits of\nthe case that may cause prejudice to the Accused,\nought to be avoided. Suffice it is to state that the bail\norder should reveal the factors that have been\nconsidered by the Court for granting relief to the\nAccused.\"\n\n8.\nIn yet another case of\nAyub Khan v. The State of Rajasthan\n\n2024 INSC 994, the Hon'ble Apex Court has reiterated that bail can\n\nonly be cancelled upon supervening circumstances or abuse of liberty,\n\nnot merely because of the gravity of the offence.\n\n9. Bearing above judicial precedent on cancellation of bail in\n\nmind, in the considered opinion of this court, no exceptional ground\n\nhas been put forth except stating that respondent is main accused and\n\noffence is serious. Several above referred citations are relied and there\n\nis no dispute that the Hon'ble Apex Court had cancelled the bail in\n\nthose cases. On court query as to whether there is non compliance or\nACB-63-2025\n\n-10-\n\nbreach of any condition imposed by this Court while granting bail,\n\nlearned APP answered in negative. Moreover, it is brought to the\n\nnotice of this Court by learned counsel for respondent that charge is\n\nalready framed and matter is committed, but no trial calender is\n\nreported to be drawn yet. Resultantly, no ground being made out for\n\ncancellation of bail, following order is passed :\n\nORDER\n\nApplication stands rejected.\n\n[ABHAY S. WAGHWASE, J.]\n\nvre",
