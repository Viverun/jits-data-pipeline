Bail Application No. 41468 of 2023. The order is quoted hereinbelow :-\n\n\"1. Heard learned counsel for the applicant as well as the learned AGA for the State and perused the material placed on record.\n\n2. The instant bail application has been filed on behalf of the applicant, Smt Kamla Devi, with a prayer to release her on bail in Case Crime No. 188 of 2023, under Sections 498A, 304B IPC and Section of D.P. Act, Police Station Meja, District- Prayagraj, during pendency of trial.\n\n3. There is allegation against the applicant of committing dowry death of her daughter-in-law.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that the deceased was a short tempered lady and used to quarrel with her husband. She was living separately with her husband and not with the applicant. The son of the applicant and co-accused, Anil Keshari, informed the parents of the deceased about the suicide committed by her from his mobile phone. It has submitted that the informant is running shop of fire crackers and has no other property and therefore the allegation that he spent Rs. 5 lakhs in a marriage of the deceased and further demand of Rs. 2 lakhs and two wheeler were being made is not credible. Supplementary-affidavit has been filed on behalf of applicant bringing on record the inquest report of the body of the deceased which does not shows any other injury on her body except the ligature mark on her neck. The statements of independent eye witnesses recorded by the Investigating Officer have been brought on record which prove that the applicant was living with Shubham Keshari and Rahul Keshari, her sons and not with the deceased and her husband. The pradhan of the village also testified to the aforesaid fact. The applicant has been falsely implicated in this case. She has no criminal history to her credit and is languishing in jail since 15.05.2023. The trial in the aforesaid case is not likely to be concluded in near future.\n\n5. Learned A.G.A. and learned counsel for informant have filed a counter-affidavit and vehemently opposed the bail application. They have submitted that gram pradhan of the village is neighbour of the applicant and, therefore, he has given false statement. They have submitted that the entire family was living together in the same house and the husband of the deceased was only earning member of the family. Charge-sheet has already been submitted against the applicant and husband of the deceased. They have submitted that the deceases was pregnant at the time of alleged alleged offence. In case the applicant is released on bail he will again indulge in similar activities and will misuse the liberty of bail.\n\n6. After hearing the rival contentions, this Court finds that the death of the deceased has taken place on account of hanging. No other injury was found on her person. There is also no evidence or allegation to prove that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband in connection with any demand of dowry.
