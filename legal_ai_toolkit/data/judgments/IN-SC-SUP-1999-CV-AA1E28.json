This appeal, an off-shoot of the\njudgment of this Court in\nCommon Cause vs. Union of India\n\n[1987 (1) SCC 142], arises from the judgment and order of a\nDivision Bench of the Madras High Court in Writ Petition\nNo.12381 of 1996 dated January 22, 1998. The appellant, who\nis a Senior Advocate and a member of the Madras High Court\nBar, filed writ petition No.12381 of 1996, a public interest\nlitigation, in the High Court of Madras challenging\nMemorandum No.34/2/86-P&PW(G) dated August 22, 1990 issued\nby Department of Pension and Pensioner's Welfare and also\nthe letter dated September 26, 1990, applying the above said\nMemorandum to the Department of Justice, and seeking\ndeclaration that it does not apply to the Judges of the High\nCourts and the Supreme Court of India. The substance of the\nappellant's case before the High Court was that the Supreme\nCourt had issued direction that payment of reduced pension\non account of commutation of a part of the pension of a\nGovernment employee should be only for a period of 15 years\n\"from the date of retirement\", but the Union of India issued\nimpugned Memorandum changing it to \"from the date of\ncommutation of pension\".\n\nThe Union of India, in its\ncounter-affidavit, stated that the Supreme Court clarified\nthe direction given in\nCommon Cause\n(supra) in its\nsubsequent judgment that the period of 15 years be reckoned\nfrom the date of commutation and not from the date of\nretirement. Pursuant to the subsequent judgment of this\nCourt, Government of India revised its earlier Memorandum\nNo.34/2/86-P&PW dated March 5, 1987 and brought into force\nthe impugned Memorandum. A Division Bench of the Madras\nHigh Court, taking note of the various judgments of this\nCourt, dismissed the writ petition by order dated January\n22, 1998. It is against that judgment, this appeal is\npreferred. Mr.R. Venkataraman, learned senior counsel for\nthe appellant, strenuously contended that once the\nGovernment of India accepted in principle that the commuted\npension would be recovered for a period of 15 years from the\ndate of retirement and the same had culminated into a\ndirection of this Court, they could not have unilaterally\nchanged the same to reckon the period of 15 years from the\ndate of commutation of pension. The learned counsel has\nsubmitted that under the Pension Rules, a pensioner can\ncommute a part of his pension only within one year of the\ndate of retirement, therefore, the stand of the Government\nthat those who applied for and got their pension commuted\njust on the verge of the completion of 15 years would be\nable to claim their full pension after a few months of\ndeduction was without any basis. Mr. A.S. Nambiar,\nlearned senior counsel appearing for the respondents, has\nargued that the period of 15 years is fixed on the basis\nthat the commuted pension would normally be recovered within\nthe said period; when the commutation of pension and the\ndate of retirement synchronize, no difficulty would arise\nbut if the pension is commuted long after the date of\nretirement, the period of 15 years will be cut short when\ncounted from the date of retirement and in the result the\npensioners will get an undue and unintended benefit of the\norder of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the case of\nCommon Cause\n\n(supra), it was represented before this Court in a Writ\nPetition under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution that on\ncommutation of pension the amount paid to the pensioner in\nlump sum by the Government would be recovered from his\npension within a period of 12 years, there was, therefore,\nno justification for the Government to pay reduced pension\nfor the rest of the life of the pensioner. This Court\ndesired that the Government might give a new look to the\napplication of Central Civil Service (Commutation of\nPension) Rules, 1981. The Government took decision in the\nmatter and communicated the same through the learned\nAttorney General, which is in the following terms :\n\n\"(i) Recovery from pension payable every month towards\ncommuted value of pension will stop on the completion of 15\nyears from the date of retirement on superannuation or on\nthe pensioner completing the age of 70 years, whichever is\nlater.\n\n(ii) The formulation will apply to all civilian\npensioners in whose case the age of retirement on\nsuperannuation is 58 years and the personnel of Armed Forces\nin whose case the retirement age varies in accordance with\nthe colour service prescribed for the rank (attaining the\nage of 37/38 years or more).\n\n(iii) Government have taken this decision as an act of\ngoodwill to pensioners and to extend to them some measure of\nrelief in the evening of their lives. It is sincerely\nbelieved that there will be no further demand on this issue\nand that the pensioners will accept the decision of the\nGovernment without dissent or reservation.\n\n(iv) The decision will take effect prospectively (from\nApril 1, 1986).\"\n\nIn hoc the first point, this Court considered it\nunnecessary to refer to the age of commuting pensioner for\nrestoration of full pension to him but on taking note of the\nfacts that the lump sum amount would fetch benefit like\ninterest and there is also an element of risk factor,\ndirected by its judgment dated December 9, 1986 that \"on the\nexpiry of 15 years from the period of retirement\" full\npension should be restored.\nIn terms of\nthe said judgment\n,\nthe Government issued Memorandum dated March 5, 1987.\n\nIn\nWelfare Association of Absorbed Central Government Employees\nin Public Enterprises vs. Union of India & Ors. [1991 (2)\nSCC 265], the question canvassed before this Court was\nwhether Central Government employees, who had taken benefit\nof the judgment in\nCommon Cause\n(supra) and subsequently got\nabsorbed in Public Enterprises, were entitled to the benefit\nof that judgment again on retirement from public\nenterprises. While negativing their claim, it was observed,\n\"this court for the reasons indicated in the judgment came\nto hold that on expiry of 15 years from the date of\ncommutation the entire pension revived.\"\n\nFrom this\nobservation it can be noticed that the judgment in\nCommon\nCause\n(supra) was neither modified nor clarified.\n\nWhat all\ncan be inferred is that this Court in Welfare Association's\ncase (supra) understood the words \"on the expiry of 15 years\nfrom the period of retirement\" in\nCommon Cause\n(supra) as\n\"15 years from the date of commutation....\".\nThe judgment\nin Welfare Association case (supra) was rendered on April\n12, 1990. It is only pursuant to that judgment, the counter\naffidavit recites, the Government revised its earlier Office\nMemorandum dated March 5, 1987 and brought into force the\nimpugned Office Memorandum dated August 22, 1990.\nIn\nBharat\nPetroleum Corporation Ltd. Ex-Employees Association & Ors.\nvs Chairman & Managing Director Bharat Petroleum Corporation\nLtd., Bombay & Ors.\n[1993 (3) Scale 424], this Court\nextended the benefit of the judgment in\nCommon Cause\n(supra)\nto the clerical employees of Bharat Petroleum. There also\nthe words \"period of 15 years from the period of retirement\"\n\nwere understood as \"15 years from the date of commutation\".\n\nIn Welfare Association of Absorbed Central Government\nEmployees in\nPublic Enterprises & Ors. vs. Union of India\n& Anr.\n[AIR 1996 SC 1201], the relief sought by the\npensioners in their petition under\nArticle 32\nof the\nConstitution was : restoration of 1/3rd portion of the\nfully commuted pension as per the decision of this Court in\n\nCommon Cause\n(supra). A three-Judge Bench, of which one of\nus (Venkataswami,J.) was a member, reiterated the principles\napplied in the aforementioned cases. Indeed, the date from\nwhich 15 years pension was to be reckoned was not in issue\nthere.\n\nThis Court strikes at arbitrary action of the State\nand accordingly it did in\nCommon Cause\n(supra), by\ninterdicting the arbitrary action of the Government in\npaying the reduced pension as a result of commutation of\n1/3rd pension for the rest of the life of the pensioners and\nissued an equitable direction to restore the full pension\nafter 15 years \"from the period of the retirement\" to the\npensioners who had commuted 1/3rd of the pension. The\nperiod of 15 years has been arrived at after taking into\nconsideration various factors mentioned above. It is\nwell-settled principle that the words in the judgment of the\nCourt cannot be interpreted as the words in a statute. By\nthe said direction this Court never intended to confer any\nunfair or undue advantage on the pensioners. It only\nensured fairness in the treatment of pensioners at the hands\nof the Government in respect of deduction of pension\nconsequent upon the commutation of the portion of the\npension.\n\nThe decision in\nCommon Cause\n(supra) has been\nunderstood in all subsequent judgments of this Court as 15\nyears from the date of commutation and we are in respectful\nagreement with the same. This neither prejudices the rights\nof any of the parties nor confers any undue or unfair\nadvantage upon any party.\n\nFrom the above discussion, it\nfollows that the impugned Memorandum does not incorporate\nany condition contrary to the judgment of this Court in\n\nCommon Cause\n(supra). The High Court was, therefore, right\nin dismissing the writ petition. We find no illegality in\nthe order of the High Court. The appeal fails and it is\naccordingly dismissed. No costs.",

DATE OF JUDGMENT: 23/08/1999  BENCH: K.VENKATASWAMI, SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI  JUDGMENT:  SYED SHAH MOHAMMED QUADRI, J.  LEAVE IS GRANTED. THIS APPEAL, AN OFF-SHOOT OF THE JUDGMENT OF THIS COURT IN COMMON CAUSE VS. UNION OF INDIA  [1987 (1) SCC 142], ARISES FROM THE JUDGMENT AND ORDER OF A DIVISION BENCH OF THE MADRAS HIGH COURT IN WRIT PETITION NO.12381 OF 1996 DATED JANUARY 22, 1998. THE APPELLANT, WHO IS A SENIOR ADVOCATE AND A MEMBER OF THE MADRAS HIGH COURT BAR, FILED WRIT PETITION NO.12381 OF 1996, A PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION, IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADRAS CHALLENGING MEMORANDUM NO.34/2/86-P&PW(G) DATED AUGUST 22, 1990 ISSUED BY DEPARTMENT OF PENSION AND PENSIONER'S WELFARE AND ALSO THE LETTER DATED SEPTEMBER 26, 1990, APPLYING THE ABOVE SAID MEMORANDUM TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AND SEEKING DECLARATION THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE JUDGES OF THE HIGH COURTS AND THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE APPELLANT'S CASE BEFORE THE HIGH COURT WAS THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAD ISSUED DIRECTION THAT PAYMENT OF REDUCED PENSION ON ACCOUNT OF COMMUTATION OF A PART OF THE PENSION OF A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE SHOULD BE ONLY FOR A PERIOD OF 15 YEARS \"FROM THE DATE OF RETIREMENT\", BUT THE UNION OF INDIA ISSUED IMPUGNED MEMORANDUM CHANGING IT TO \"FROM THE DATE OF COMMUTATION OF PENSION\".  THE UNION OF INDIA, IN ITS COUNTER-AFFIDAVIT, STATED THAT THE SUPREME COURT CLARIFIED THE DIRECTION GIVEN IN COMMON CAUSE (SUPRA) IN ITS SUBSEQUENT JUDGMENT THAT THE PERIOD OF 15 YEARS BE RECKONED FROM THE DATE OF COMMUTATION AND NOT FROM THE DATE OF RETIREMENT. PURSUANT TO THE SUBSEQUENT JUDGMENT OF THIS COURT, GOVERNMENT OF INDIA REVISED ITS EARLIER MEMORANDUM NO.34/2/86-P&PW DATED MARCH 5, 1987 AND BROUGHT INTO FORCE THE IMPUGNED MEMORANDUM. A DIVISION BENCH OF THE MADRAS HIGH COURT, TAKING NOTE OF THE VARIOUS JUDGMENTS OF THIS COURT, DISMISSED THE WRIT PETITION BY ORDER DATED JANUARY 22, 1998. IT IS AGAINST THAT JUDGMENT, THIS APPEAL IS PREFERRED. MR.R. VENKATARAMAN, LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL FOR THE APPELLANT, STRENUOUSLY CONTENDED THAT ONCE THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE THAT THE COMMUTED PENSION WOULD BE RECOVERED FOR A PERIOD OF 15 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF RETIREMENT AND THE SAME HAD CULMINATED INTO A DIRECTION OF THIS COURT, THEY COULD NOT HAVE UNILATERALLY CHANGED THE SAME TO RECKON THE PERIOD OF 15 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF COMMUTATION OF PENSION. THE LEARNED COUNSEL HAS SUBMITTED THAT UNDER THE PENSION RULES, A PENSIONER CAN COMMUTE A PART OF HIS PENSION ONLY WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE OF RETIREMENT, THEREFORE, THE STAND OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT THOSE WHO APPLIED FOR AND GOT THEIR PENSION COMMUTED JUST ON THE VERGE OF THE COMPLETION OF 15 YEARS WOULD BE ABLE TO CLAIM THEIR FULL PENSION AFTER A FEW MONTHS OF DEDUCTION WAS WITHOUT ANY BASIS. MR. A.S. NAMBIAR, LEARNED SENIOR COUNSEL APPEARING FOR THE RESPONDENTS, HAS ARGUED THAT THE PERIOD OF 15 YEARS IS FIXED ON THE BASIS THAT THE COMMUTED PENSION WOULD NORMALLY BE RECOVERED WITHIN THE SAID PERIOD; WHEN THE COMMUTATION OF PENSION AND THE DATE OF RETIREMENT SYNCHRONIZE, NO DIFFICULTY WOULD ARISE BUT IF THE PENSION IS COMMUTED LONG AFTER THE DATE OF RETIREMENT, THE PERIOD OF 15 YEARS WILL BE CUT SHORT WHEN COUNTED FROM THE DATE OF RETIREMENT AND IN THE RESULT THE PENSIONERS WILL GET AN UNDUE AND UNINTENDED BENEFIT OF THE ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT.  IN THE CASE OF COMMON CAUSE  (SUPRA), IT WAS REPRESENTED BEFORE THIS COURT IN A WRIT PETITION UNDER"
