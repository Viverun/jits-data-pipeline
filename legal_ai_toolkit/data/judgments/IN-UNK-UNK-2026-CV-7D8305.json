Rules, 1962, the substantive\nvacancies of Section officers are manned by direct recruits\nand promotees and a quota of one-fifth of the substantive\nvacancies has been reserved to be filled up by direct\nrecruits. The remaining substantive vacancies of Section\nofficers are to be filled up by appointment of persons\nincluded in the select list i.e. by promotion. The direct\nrecruits on their appointment against substantive vacancies\nbecome senior to the promotees, as is in the present case.\n The promotion of Section officers to Grade I post of\nC.S.S. Rules is made in accordance with the provisions of\nsub-rule 2 of rule 12 of the said Rules framed in 1962.\nAccording to this rule the direct recruits were eligible for\npromotion to Grade I in C.S.S. even though they have not\nrendered 10 years service, when promotee Section officers\njunior to them are considered for promotion to Grade l. The\npromotee Section officers had to render 10 years' approved\nservice as Section officer before being considered for\npromotion to Grade I. This rule had been\n148\namended from time to time, the last of which was in 1984 by\nway of Notification No. 5/9/80 CS. I dated 29th December,\n1984 which prescribed 8 years of approved service as Section\nofficer as condition of eligibility for being considered for\npromotion to Grade I post in C.S.S.\n This amendment was challenged before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal which dismissed the applications,\nholding that the amended rule is valid, just and equitable\nand no exception can be taken to it, and that it is not\nultra vires of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n Aggrieved by the said order three appeals have been\npreferred before this Court, by way of special leave. It was\ncontended that the amendment purports to entrench upon the\nprospects of the directly recruited Section officers for\nbeing considered for promotion to Grade l in as much as they\nare left out of the zone of consideration while their\njuniors i.e. the promotee Section officers are eligible for\nbeing considered for promotion to Grade I. This condition of\neligibility has no nexus to suitability for promotion to the\npost and as such is in violation of the equality clause in\n\nArticle 16\n of the Constitution of India.\n It was contended that for purposes of seniority in\nservice the senior will be considered for promotion before\nthose who are junior to them in service, and that the\ncondition of eligibility as laid down in the said rule has\nno reference to suitability for promotion to the post and as\nsuch it is arbitrary and so void. The system prior to the\namendment worked out satisfactorily and the direct recruit\nSection officers who were promoted to Grade I post performed\ntheir duties attached to the higher post duly and\nsatisfactorily, and therefore the amendment is arbitrary and\ninequitable, and that this amendment works out to the\nserious prejudice of the direct recruit Section officers.\n It was submitted that the effect of the amendment is to\nneutralise and negative the decision of this Court in H.V.\nPardasani & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., [1985] 2 SCC 468\nwhich held that the rules of seniority on the basis of\nquota-rota basis are unexceptionable.\n On behalf of the promotee Section officers it was\ncontended that the inter-se seniority between direct recruit\nSection officers and promotee Section officers is fixed in\naccordance with the quota-rota rule and thus has no\nreference to the length of service. The promotee Section\nofficers have not been considered for promotion m spite of\ntheir rendering service as such for more than 13 years,\nwhereas the direct recruit\n149\nSection officers who were appointed much later were\nconsidered and promoted purely on the ground of seniority.\nThis has created frustration in the minds of the promotees\nand in order to obviate this, the Government has amended the\nproviso and that the amendment is neither arbitrary nor\nunjust.\n Dismissing the appeals, this Court,\n^\n HELD: 1. The rule in question which prescribes on\nuniform period of qualified service cannot be said to be\narbitrary or unjust or violative of \nArticles 14\n or 16 of the\nConstitution. The rule making authority, by the amendment\nmade in 1984, has brought in an uniform eligibility\nqualification of 8 years' approved service to be rendered by\nthe Section officers-both promotees and direct recruits\nbefore coming within the zone of consideration for promotion\nto Grade I. Thus it treats all Section officers equally and\nthere is no discrimination between the Section officers. The\ndirectly recruited Section officers are not totally excluded\nfrom the zone of consideration for promotion. They will be\nconsidered like the promotee Section officers as soon as\nthey have rendered eight years' approved service as Section\nofficers. The eligibility conditions imposed has a nexus to\nthe object sought to be achieved, viz. enlisting experienced\nofficers of proven merit to man the higher posts by way of\npromotion. [158B; 156B-D]\n 2. The validity of rule providing for fixation of\nseniority between the direct recruits and promotees in the\ngrade of Section officer on the basis of quota reserved for\ndirect recruits (i.e. 1/5 of the total substantive\nvacancies) has already been upheld by this Court. But this\ndoes not mean that the direct recruits who are senior to the\npromotees are entitled to be considered for promotion to a\nhigher post even though they do not fulfil the eligibility\nqualification specified in the rule framed by the rule-\nmaking authority. The rule-making authority is competent to\nframe rules laying down eligibility condition for promotion\nto a higher post, and it cannot be said that a direct\nrecruit who is senior to the promotees is not required to\ncomply with the eligibility condition and he is entitled to\nbe considered for promotion to the higher post merely on the\nbasis of his seniority. The submission that a senior Section\nofficer has a right to be considered for promotion to Grade\nI post when his juniors who have fulfilled the eligibility\ncondition are being considered for promotion to the higher\npost, is wholly unsustainable. [155G; 156A-B; 157D-F]\n H.V. Pardasani & Ors. v. Union of India, [1985] 2 SCC\n468, followed.\n150\n 3. When qualifications for appointment to a post in a\nparticular cadre are prescribed, the same have to be\nsatisfied before a person can be considered for appointment.\nSeniority in a particular cadre does not entitle a public\nservant for promotion to a higher post unless he fulfils the\neligibility condition prescribed by the relevant rules. A\nperson must be eligible for promotion having regard to the\nqualifications prescribed for the post before he can be\nconsidered for promotion. Seniority will be relevant only\namongst persons eligible. Seniority cannot be substituted\nfor eligibility nor can it over-ride it in the matter of\npromotion to the next higher Post. [157G-H: 158A]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\n CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal Nos. 2040-\n2042 of 1987\n From the Judgment and order dated 11.2.1986 of the\nCentral Administrative Tribunal, New Delhi in Appln.\nRegistration No. 4, 9 and 10 of 1985\n Shanti Bhushan, K.R. Nagaraja, R.S. Hegde and Jayant\nBhushan for the Appellants.\n\n V.C. Mahajan, C.V. Subba Rao, A. Subba Rao and T.S.\nSundrarajan-in-person for the Respondents.\n\n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n RAY, J. In these appeals under special leave the only\nquestion that falls for consideration is whether the service\nrule requiring 8 years of approved service as Section\nofficer both for the direct recruits as well as for\npromotees for being eligible for consideration for promotion\nto the Grade I Post in Central Secretariat Service is\narbitrary being in contravention of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of\nthe Constitution of India.\n\n The matrix of the case is that the appellants along\nwith one Rajiv Kalsi made four applications under \nsection 19\n\nof the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 challenging the\nvires of proviso to sub-rule 2 of Rule 12 of Central\nSecretariate Service (C.S.S.), 1962 as amended by\nNotification No. 5/8/80-CS. I dated 29th December, 1984\nprescribing 8 years of approved service as Section officer\nas condition of eligibility for being considered for\npromotion to Grade-I Post in C.S.S. The appellants, Miss\nPrabha Devi and Shri Rajiv Kalsi were recruited directly-\nthrough examination held by Union Public Service Commis-\n\n151\n\nsion in 1978 as Section officers. The appellants Shri G.S.\nGrewal and Shri Surjit Singh were recruited through\nexamination held by Union Public Service Commission in 1980\nas Section officers. These direct recruits had been\nappointed in substantive vacancies of Section officers in\naccordance with the quota reserved for direct recruits by\nthe service rules. The inter se seniority of the direct\nrecruits and the promotees is fixed in accordance with the\nquota and rota system. The appellants are seniors to the\npromotees in accordance with the said quota and rota Rule.\nThe promotion to Grade I post of C.S.S. Rules is made in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-rule 2 of rule 12 of\nthe said Rules. The proviso to sub-rule 2 of rule 12 of\nC.S.S. Rules, 1962 was originally to the following effect:\n\n \"Provided that if any person appointed to the\n Section officers' Grade before the prescribed date\n is considered for promotion to Grade I in\n accordance with the provisions of this sub-rule,\n all persons senior to him in that grade before the\n prescribed date shall also be considered\n notwithstanding that they may not have rendered l0\n years' approved service in the grade.\"\n\n According to this rule the direct recruits were\neligible for consideration for promotion to Grade I in\nC.S.S. even though they have not rendered 10 years' service\nwhen promotee Section officers junior to them are considered\nfor promotion to Grade I. The promotee Section officers had\nto render 10 years' approved service as Section officer\nbefore being considered for promotion to Grade I. This\nproviso to sub-rule (2) of Rule 12 was substituted by the\nfollowing proviso with effect from July 31, 1972:\n\n \"Provided further that if any person appointed to\n the Section officers' Grade is considered for\n promotion to Grade I under this sub-rule, all\n persons senior to him in that grade shall also be\n considered notwithstanding that they may not have\n rendered 10 years' approved service in that grade.\n \"\n\n The proviso to sub-rule (2) of rule 12 was again\nsubstituted by the following proviso with effect from\nFebruary 23, 1978:\n\n \"Provided further that if any person appointed to\n the Section officers' Grade is considered for\n promotion to Grade I under this sub-rule, all\n persons senior to him in Section Officers' Grade\n who have rendered not less than six years'\n\n152\n\n approved service in that Grade, shall also be\n considered notwithstanding that they may not have\n rendered 10 years' approved service in that Grade;\n provided that the aforesaid condition of six\n years' approved service shall not apply to a\n person belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the\n Scheduled Tribes.\"\n\n Thus according to this proviso to sub-rule (2) of rule\n12 a direct recruit Section officer who has rendered six\nyears' approved service in that grade was eligible for\nconsideration for promotion to Grade I whereas a promotee\nSection officer would have to render ten years' approved\nservice in the grade of Section officer before being\neligible for consideration for promotion. In 1979 the\nsubstantive part of sub-rule (2) of rule 12 was amended to\nprovide eight years' approved service in the Section\nofficers' Grade as against ten years approved service for\neligibility for promotion to Grade I of C.S.S. The third\nproviso of sub-rule (2) of rule 12 was further substituted\nby the following proviso by Notification dated December 29,\n1984:\n\n \"Provided further that if any person appointed to\n the Section officers' Grade is considered for\n promotion to Grade I under this sub-rule, all\n persons senior to him in Section officers' Grade,\n belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled\n Tribes who have rendered not less than 4 years'\n approved service in that grade, shall also be\n considered for promotion.\n\n This amended rule enjoins that a directly recruited\nSection officer has to render 8 years' approved service in\nthe grade of Section officer before being eligible for\nconsideration for promotion to Grade I. The only exception\nmade in this rule is with regard to Section officers\nbelonging to the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes who\nshall have to render only four years approved service in\nthat grade in order to qualify themselves for being\nconsidered for promotion to the said Grade I.\n This condition of eligibility as introduced by the 1984\namendment of the third proviso of sub-rule (2) of rule 12\nhas been questioned in the petitions before the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal which after hearing the parties\ndismissed the applications by a common judgment holding\ninter alia that neither the amendment of February, 1978 nor\nthe amendment of December, 1984 made in the proviso to sub-\nrule (2) of rule 12 of the C.S.S. Rules, 1962 is\ndiscriminatory or arbitrary or\n\n153\n\nunreasonable so as to be declared ultra vires of \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16\n of the Constitution of India. It has been further\nheld that the amended rule of December, 1984 is valid, just\nand equitable and no exception can he taken to it.\n\n Aggrieved by the said order these three appeals on\nspecial leave have been preferred before this Court. Mr.\nShanti Bhushan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\nappellants has advanced three-fold submissions before this\nCourt. The first submission is that the impugned amendment\nmade in third proviso of sub-rule (2) of rule 12 of C.S.S.\nRules purports to entrench upon the prospects of the\ndirectly recruited Section officers for being considered for\npromotion to Grade I in as much as they are left out of the\nzone of consideration while their juniors i.e. the promotee\nSection officers are eligible for being considered for\npromotion to Grade I. This condition of eligibility has no\nnexus to suitability for promotion to the post and as such\nthis is in violation of the equality clause in \nArticle 16\n of\nthe Constitution of India. It has been submitted that any\nrule framed by the Government must be subject to the\nFundamental Rights guaranteed by the \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of\nthe Constitution of India. Seniority of the direct recruits\nentitles them for consideration for promotion to the higher\npost while their juniors i.e. promotee Section officers are\nbeing considered for promotion to the higher post. The\npurpose of the seniority in service is that the senior will\nbe considered for promotion before those who are junior to\nthem in the service. Of course, a senior incumbent may be\nconsidered not suitable for promotion. It has been submitted\nthat the condition of eligibility as laid down in the said\nrule has no reference to suitability for promotion to the\npost and as such it is arbitrary and so void. It has been\nsubmitted in this connection that prior to 1978 directly\nrecruited Section officers having rendered 3-4 years of\nservice in that grade had been promoted to Grade I and they\nhad duly performed their duties. Some of them have rendered\ntheir service in the promoted post very efficiently and they\nhave earned remarks such as \"very meritorious and\noutstanding\" from the Department. There is nothing to show\nthat the promoted direct recruits were proved inefficient in\ndischarging their duties and responsibilities of the higher\npost.\n\n Mr. Shanti Bhushan furhter submitted that even in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-rule (2) of rule 12 as\namended in 1978 direct recruit Section officers after having\nrendered six years' approved service in the grade had been\nconsidered for promotion and were promoted to Grade I. This\nsystem worked out very satisfactorily and\n\n154\n\nthe direct recruit Section officers who were promoted to\nGrade I post performed their duties attached to the higher\npost duly and satisfactorily. The amendment of the\neligibility qualification in 1984 providing a longer period\nof service as S.O. is, therefore, arbitrary and inequitable.\nThere is no rationale behind this amendment which works to\nthe serious prejudice of the direct recruit Section officers\nfor being considered for promotion to Grade I of the C.S.S.\nService even though the promotee Section officers junior to\nthem are being considered for promotion.\n\n It has been secondly contended that the rule of\ndetermination of seniority on quota-rota basis in the grade\nof Section officers having been held valid and not arbitrary\nby this Court in the case of H.V. Pardasani and ors. v.\nUnion of India and Ors., [1985] 2 SCC 468, the condition of\neligibility introduced by the 1984 amendment of sub-rule (2)\nof rule 12 is wholly unjust and arbitrary as it excludes\ndirect recruit Section officers from the zone of\nconsideration for promotion even though their juniors having\nput in eight years' approved service as Section officers are\neligible for consideration for promotion. It has been\nsubmitted that the effect of the amendment is to neutralise\nand negative the decision of this Court which held that the\nrules of seniority on the basis of quota-rota basis are\nunexceptionable. It has been lastly contended that at any\nrate the promotee Section officers form a very small portion\nof the officers promoted to the Grade I Post and as such\nelimination of the direct recruit Section officers from the\nzone of consideration for promotion will not have any\nappreciable effect in as much as it will not obviate the\nfrustration of the promotee Section officers for not being\npromoted to the higher post. It has also been submitted that\nit is unjust and arbitrary to prevent the senior Section\nofficers from being considered for promotion by enhancing\nthe period of service from six years to eight years to be\nrendered in the grade of Section officer.\n\n Mr. T.S. Sundara Rajan, a promotee Section officer,\nRespondent No. 2 has submitted that the appellants who are\ndirectly recruited Section officers on the result of\nexamination held by the Union Public Service Commission in\n1978 and 1980 against substantive vacancies, have become\nsenior to the promotee Section officers on the basis of the\nquota reserved for direct recruits even though the promotee\nSection officers have rendered more than thirteen years'\nservice as Section officers. This Fixation of seniority has\nno reference to the length of service. The inter se\nseniority between the direct recruits and the promotee\nSection officers being determined on the basis of the\n\n155\n\nquota, the promotee Section officers even though they have\nbeen A promoted to the post of Section officers and have\nrendered service for a considerable period have become\njuniors to them in service and were not considered for\npromotion even. These promotee Section officers like the\nRespondent No. 2 have not been considered for promotion in\nspite of their rendering service as such for more than\nthirteen years whereas the direct recruit Section officers\nwho were appointed much later were considered and promoted\npurely on the ground of seniority. This has created\nfrustration in the minds of the promotees. To obviate this\nthe Government after due consideration of all aspect has by\nNotification dated December 29, 1984 amended the proviso to\nsub-rule (2) of rule 12 of C.S.S. Rules prescribing an\nuniform eligibility of rendering eight years' approved\nservice as Section officers by both the direct recruit\nSection officers and the promotee Section Officers for being\nconsidered for promotion to Grade I (Under Secretary). The\nsaid amendment, it has been submitted, is neither arbitrary\nnor unjust. It has been further submitted that the promotee\nSection officers if given promotion will render their\nservice duly and efficiently as has been rendered by the\ndirect recruit Section officers promoted to Grade I.\n According to the C.S.S. Rules, 1962, the substantive\nvacancies of Section officers are manned by direct recruits\nand promotees and a quota of one-fifth of the total\nsubstantive vacancies has been reserved to be filled up by\ndirect recruits. The remaining substantive vacancies of\nSection officers are filled up by appointment of persons\nincluded in the select list i.e. by promotion. The inter se\nseniority between the direct recruits and promotees is\ndetermined on the basis of the quota-rota rule. The direct\nrecruits on their appointment against substantive vacancies\nbecome senior to the promotees.\n\n This Court in the case of H.V. Pardasani and ors. v.\nUnion of India and Ors. (supra) considered the question of\nthe validity of rule providing for fixation of seniority\nbetween the direct recruits and promotees in the grade of\nSection officer on the basis of quota reserved for direct\nrecruits and held that the prescription of quota becomes\nnecessary to work out a scheme constituting a service manned\nby both the direct recruits as well as promotees. Such a\nscheme is unexceptionable and seniority based upon the rota\nis also not open to attack. The scheme does not appear to be\narbitrary and the rules and regulations to give effect to\nthe scheme are not ultra vires either \nArticle 14\n or \nArticle\n16\n of the Constitution. Therefore, the inter se seniority of\ndirect recruit and promotee Section officers on the basis of\n\n156\n\nquota-rota rules has been held to be valid. This does not\nmean that the A direct recruits who are senior to the\npromotees are entitled to be considered for promotion to a\nhigher post even though they do not fulfil the eligibility\nqualification specified in the rule framed by the rule-\nmaking authority. The rule-making authority by the amendment\nmade in 1984 has brought in an uniform eligibility\nqualification of eight years' approved service to be\nrendered by the Section officers-both promotees and direct\nrecruits before coming within the Zone of consideration for\npromotion to Grade I. Thus it treats all Section officers\nequally and there is no discrimination between the Section\nofficers. It has been submitted that this rule is arbitrary\nand unreasonable as it prescribes a certain minimum service\nin a lower post for promotion to a higher post on the ground\nthat it has no nexus to suitability for holding the higher\npost. This submission in our considered opinion, cannot be\nsustained in as much as experience over certain number of\nyears in service and also due performance of the duties and\nresponsibilities attached to the post of Section officer is\nvery relevant and as such prescribing such an eligibility\nqualification has nexus to the suitability for the promoted\npost. The directly recruited Section officers are not\ntotally excluded from the zone of consideration for\npromotion. They will be considered like the promotee Section\nofficer as soon as they have rendered eight years' approved\nservice as Section officer. The Tribunal has held that:\n\n \"The qualifications for any post are prescribed\n having regard to the nature of the post and the\n duties and responsibilities attached to it. For\n due discharge of duties attached to a post,\n academic excellence alone may not be sufficient.\n Factors like experience over certain number of\n years in service and holding a post of a certain\n level are relevant. That gives them the\n opportunity to deal with several files, handle\n different situations, tackle varied problems,\n extract work from subordinates of varying\n capabilities and serve under superiors with\n differing styles of functioning. They acquire\n knowledge of men and matters and the necessary\n acumen to deal with issues arising from time to\n time. Academic brilliance and excellent\n performance at the competitive examinations by\n themselves cannot wholly substitute experience.\n They can only supplement. However brilliant a\n person may be, he needs experience such as can be\n gathered only by discharging the duties and\n responsibilities attached to a post. If\n recruitment to a post is by way of promotion, the\n minimum\n\n157\n\n number of years one should serve in the lower post\n would have to be prescribed. Valuable experience\n gained in service, better equips a person to\n shoulder higher responsibilities and man the\n superior post. Period spent in discharge of duties\n of a post has nexus to. the object of enlisting\n experienced officers of proven merit with\n consistent good record over sufficiently long\n period to man the higher posts by way of\n promotion.\"\n\n The 1984 amendment of the rules providing an\neligibility condition of rendering eight years' approved\nservice as section officer for coming within the zone of\nconsideration for promotion to Grade I Post of C.S.S. is not\nat all arbitrary and unreasonable as it prescribes a minimum\nperiod of eight years' of service as Section officer both\nfor direct recruits and promotees as a condition of\neligibility for consideration for promotion to the higher\npost. This rule is, therefore, not violative of \nArticles 14\n\nand \n16\n of the Constitution of India.\n\n The rule-making authority is competent to frame rules\nlaying down eligibility condition for promotion to a higher\npost. When such an eligibility condition has been laid down\nby service rules, it cannot be said that a direct recruit\nwho is senior to the promotees is not required to comply\nwith the eligibility condition and he is entitled to be\nconsidered for promotion to the higher post merely on the\nbasis of his seniority. The amended rule in question has\nspecified a period of eight years' approved service in the\ngrade of Section officer as a condition of eligibility for\nbeing considered for promotion to Grade I post of C.S.S.\nThis rule is equally applicable to both the direct recruit\nSection officers as well as the promotee Section officers.\nThe submission that a senior Section officer has a right to\nbe considered for promotion to Grade I post when his juniors\nwho have fulfilled the eligibility condition are being\nconsidered for promotion to the higher post, Grade I, is\nwholly unsustainable. The prescribing of an eligibility\ncondition for entitlement for consideration for promotion is\nwithin the competence of the rule-making authority. This\neligibility condition has to be fulfilled by the Section\nofficers including senior direct recruits in order to be\neligible for being considered for promotion. When\nqualifications for appointment to a post in a particular\ncadre are prescribed, the same have to be satisfied before a\nperson can be considered for appointment. Seniority in a\nparticular cadre does not entitle a public servant for\npromotion to a higher post unless he fulfils the eligibility\ncondition prescribed by the relevant rules. A person must be\neligible for promotion having regard to the qualifications\nprescribed for the\n\n158\n\npost before he can be considered for promotion. Seniority\nwill be relevant only amongst persons eligible. Seniority\ncannot be substituted for eligibility nor it can over-ride\nit in the matter of promotion to the next higher post. The\nrule in question which prescribes an uniform period of\nqualified service cannot be said to be arbitrary or unjust\nviolative of \nArticles 14\n or 16 of the Constitution. It has\nbeen rightly held by the Tribunal:\n\n \"When certain length of service in a particular\n cadre can validly be prescribed and is so\n prescribed, unless a person possesses that\n qualification, he cannot be considered eligible\n for appointment. There is no law which lays down\n that a senior in service would automatically be\n eligible for promotion. Seniority by itself does\n not outweight experience.\"\n\n It has also been observed:\n\n \"In any event, the appropriate Rule making\n Authority is the best judge in this regard. The\n Rule making Authority is certainly competent to\n amend the Rule and extend the period from 6 years\n to 8 years so as to make the direct recruits more\n experienced and suitable for the higher post. That\n is a matter for the Rule making Authority; the\n Tribunal cannot sit in judgment over the opinion\n of the Rule making Authority. No Court or Tribunal\n can substitute its own view in a matter such as\n this. Such a Rule framed by a competent Authority\n cannot be struck down unless it is shown to be\n violative of any Fundamental Right guaranteed to a\n citizen under the Constitution.\"\n\n We do not find any infirmity in the above findings\narrived at by the Tribunal.\n\n In the premises aforesaid we hold that the third\nproviso to sub rule 2 of Rule 12 of Central Secretariat\nService Rules, 1962 as amended by Notification No.\n5/8/80-CS. I. dated 29th December, 1984 is not ultra vires\nof \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution. The judgment and\norder of the Central Administrative Tribunal is hereby\naffirmed and the appeals are dismissed without costs.\n\nG.N. Appeals dismissed.\n\n159",

Rules, 1962, the substantive\nvacancies of Section officers are manned by direct recruits\nand promotees and a quota of one-fifth of the substantive\nvacancies has been reserved to be filled up by direct\nrecruits. The remaining substantive vacancies of Section\nofficers are to be filled up by appointment of persons\nincluded in the select list i.e. by promotion. The direct\nrecruits on their appointment against substantive vacancies\nbecome senior to the promotees, as is in the present case.\n The promotion of Section officers to Grade I post of\nC.S.S.

The\npromotee Section officers had to render 10 years' approved\nservice as Section officer before being considered for\npromotion to Grade I.

The system prior to the\namendment worked out satisfactorily and the direct recruit\nSection officers who were promoted to Grade I post performed\ntheir duties attached to the higher post duly and\nsatisfactorily, and therefore the amendment is arbitrary and\ninequitable, and that this amendment works out to the\nserious prejudice of the direct recruit Section officers.\n It was submitted that the effect of the amendment is to\nneutralise and negative the decision of this Court in H.V.\nPardasani & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., [1985] 2 SCC 468\nwhich held that the rules of seniority on the basis of\nquota-rota basis are unexceptionable.\n On behalf of the promotee Section officers it was\ncontended that the inter-se seniority between direct recruit\nSection officers and promotee Section officers is fixed in\naccordance with the quota-rota rule and thus has no\nreference to the length of service. The promotee Section\nofficers have not been considered for promotion m spite of\ntheir rendering service as such for more than 13 years,\nwhereas the direct recruit\n149\nSection officers who were appointed much later were\nconsidered and promoted purely on the ground of seniority.\nThis has created frustration in the minds of the promotees\nand in order to obviate this, the Government has amended the\nproviso and that the amendment is neither arbitrary nor\nunjust.\n Dismissing the appeals, this Court,\n^\n HELD: 1. The rule in question which prescribes on\nuniform period of qualified service cannot be said to be\narbitrary or unjust or violative of \nArticles 14\n or 16 of the\nConstitution. The rule making authority, by the amendment\nmade in 1984, has brought in an uniform eligibility\nqualification of 8 years' approved service to be rendered by\nthe Section officers-both promotees and direct recruits\nbefore coming within the zone of consideration for promotion\nto Grade I. Thus it treats all Section officers equally and\nthere is no discrimination between the Section officers. The\ndirectly recruited Section officers are not totally excluded\nfrom the zone of consideration for promotion. They will be\nconsidered like the promotee Section officers as soon as\nthey have rendered eight years' approved service as Section\nofficers. The eligibility conditions imposed has a nexus to\nthe object sought to be achieved, viz. enlisting experienced\nofficers of proven merit to man the higher posts by way of\npromotion. [158B; 156B-D]\n 2. The validity of rule providing for fixation of\nseniority between the direct recruits and promotees in the\ngrade of Section officer on the basis of quota reserved for\ndirect recruits (i.e. 1/5 of the total substantive\nvacancies) has already been upheld by this Court. But this\ndoes not mean that the direct recruits who are senior to the\npromotees are entitled to be considered for promotion to a\nhigher post even though they do not fulfil the eligibility\nqualification specified in the rule framed by the rule-\nmaking authority. The rule-making authority is competent to\nframe rules laying down eligibility condition for promotion\nto a higher post, and it cannot be said that a direct\nrecruit who is senior to the promotees is not required to\ncomply with the eligibility condition and he is entitled to\nbe considered for promotion to the higher post merely on the\nbasis of his seniority. The submission that a senior Section\nofficer has a right to be considered for promotion to Grade\nI post when his juniors who have fulfilled the eligibility\ncondition are being considered for promotion to the higher\npost, is wholly unsustainable. [155G; 156A-B; 157D-F]\n H.V. Pardasani & Ors. v. Union of India, [1985] 2 SCC\n468, followed.\n150\n 3. When qualifications for appointment to a post in a\nparticular cadre are prescribed, the same have to be\nsatisfied before a person can be considered for appointment.\nSeniority in a particular cadre does not entitle a public\nservant for promotion to a higher post unless he fulfils the\neligibility condition prescribed by the relevant rules. A\nperson must be eligible for promotion having regard to the\nqualifications prescribed for the post before he can be\nconsidered for promotion. Seniority will be relevant only\namongst persons eligible. Seniority cannot be substituted\nfor eligibility nor can it over-ride it in the matter of\npromotion to the next higher Post.
