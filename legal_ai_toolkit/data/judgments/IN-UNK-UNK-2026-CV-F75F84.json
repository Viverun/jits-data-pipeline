The prosecution examined 30 witnesses to prove the charges\nagainst A-1 to A-5. Thereafter, the learned ASJ recorded their separate\nstatements under \nSection 313\n Cr.PC wherein each of them claimed\ninnocence. However, the accused persons did not lead any evidence.\nPROSECTUION CASE\n\n7. The prosecution case is that on 25.10.2016, at about 7.30 PM, Jeet\nKumar, the victim was standing with his cousin Ajeet Kumar (PW-7)\noutside their house situated in the jhuggi cluster at K Block, Jahangir\nPuri, when he expressed a desire to partake chicken. Ajeet suggested that\nthey should proceed to a chicken shop situated in the A Block Market,\nJahangir Puri. Both of them proceeded on a motorcycle to the chicken\nshop (Saleem Chicken Wala), where Jeet stopped his motorcycle to\nanswer the call of nature. While they were easing themselves, six men\narrived there on two motorcycles. Ajeet recognized them and was aware\nof the fact that case FIR No.382/2016 had been registered against them\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 4 of 28\n\n on a complaint made by Jeet. Besides the accused, A-1 to A-5, one Ajay\nwas also present at the spot. The appellant grabbed Jeet by his face and\nsaid \"Tu hamare khilaf gawahi dega\". Thereafter, all the accused started\nbeating him. A-5 took out a pistol and fired at Jeet, who was hit by a\nbullet on his arm. To save himself, Jeet ran towards a nearby country\nliquor shop. All the six accused followed him in hot pursuit. PW-7 also\nran after them. On reaching near the country liquor shop, Jeet was\nthrashed by the accused persons, who said \"Is sale ko jaan se mar dete\nhai, na hoga gawah na hogi gawahi\". A-5 fired at the chest of Jeet, who\nsustained injuries and fell down on the ground. On seeing this, PW-7\nfled from the spot, rushed to his aunt, Bimla (mother of the victim) and\nhis parents and informed them about the incident. By the time they\nreached the scene of crime, Jeet was not present there. PW-7 along with\nthe family members rushed to BJRM Hospital, where the victim had\nbeen taken. As no doctor was attending to the victim, his family\nmembers rushed him to Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi where he\nwas declared „brought dead‟. This incident set into motion the criminal\nmachinery.\n\nPROSECUTION EVIDENCE:\n\n8. On receiving information of the firing, DD No.29A (Ex.PW-X-7)\nwas recorded at PS: Mahendra Park. The police reached BJRM Hospital,\nwhere they came to know that the injured had been taken by his family\nmembers to Fortis Hospital. The first IO in this case, Inspector\nDhananjay Gupta (PW-30) reached the spot and recorded the statement\nof PW-7 marked as Ex.PW7/A. He prepared the Rukka (Ex.PW30/A-\nEx.PW3/B) and handed it over to Head Constable Kamlesh Kumar (PW-\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 5 of 28\n\n 20), for registration of the FIR.

Ramesh (PW-9), father of the deceased identified the dead body of\nhis son and deposed that it was handed over to him vide memo,\nEx.PW5/A. Manoj Mehto (PW-5), Mahesh Singh (PW-6) and Suresh\nMehto (PW-8), relatives/family members of the deceased stated that they\nhad accompanied PW-9 to the mortuary and identified the dead body.\nJoginder (PW-10), Chandan (PW-11), Pawan (PW-12) and Jitender\nKumar (PW-13) are public witnesses, who deposed that they had heard\nsound of gunshots and had witnessed the accused fleeing away from the\nspot on their motorcycles. PW-12 was also a witness to the arrest of the\nappellant by the police on 29.12.2016, at 8.30 P.M.\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 9 of 28\n\n FINDINGS OF THE TRIAL COURT\n\n19. The trial court agreed with the argument advanced by the defence\ncounsel and held that there were several contradictions in the testimony\nof PW-7, the sole eye witness, which created doubt about his presence at\nthe scene of crime and gave a clear impression that the FIR had been ante\ntimed and he had been introduced later on. In other words, he was not\npresent at the scene of the crime. The aforesaid conclusion was drawn\non the ground that the conduct of PW-7 was found to be doubtful\nparticularly, when he claimed to be present at the scene of crime and was\na witness to the accused persons thrashing his cousin but had neither\nintervened or tried to save him; nor did he raise an alarm when his cousin\nwas allegedly beaten up by the accused and they had fired at him. The\ntrial court further observed that the injured was not removed to the\nhospital by PW-7 or any of his relatives but by a third person, one Surya,\nresident of Jahangirpuri, whose name was mentioned by the MLC doctor,\nPW-1 but he was not arrayed as a prosecution witness though he was the\nbest person to tell where and how he had found Jeet and taken him to the\nhospital.\n\n20. After discarding the testimony of the sole eye witness (PW-7), the\ntrial court proceeded to examine the remaining two circumstances,\nfirstly, fleeing away of the accused on motorcycles from the scene of\ncrime and secondly, recovery of the weapon of offence, as brought out\nby the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. Referring to the\ntestimonies of the public witnesses, PW-10, PW-11 and PW-12, who had\ndeposed that they had gone to the spot to purchase liquor, had heard\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 10 of 28\n\n sounds of two gunshots and seen the accused persons fleeing from the\nspot on two motorcycles, the trial court opined that there were several\ninter se contradictions, sufficient to disbelieve the prosecution version\nthat the aforesaid witnesses had seen the accused persons fleeing from\nthe scene of the crime immediately after the commission of the offence.\nThus, the first circumstance set up by the prosecution, was rejected\noutright.\n\n21. Coming to the second circumstance relating to the recovery of the\nweapon of offence on the disclosure statement made by the appellant and\nthe co-accused, Sandeep @ Bachha (A-5), the impugned judgment relied\non the testimony of three police witnesses, PW-19, PW-20 and PW-30 to\nhold that the said witnesses had fully supported and corroborated each\nother for proving recovery of the weapon of offence at the instance of the\nappellant. Thereafter, the trial court went on to conclude that recovery of\nthe weapon of the offence could not be attributed to Sandeep @ Bachha\n(A-5) as the recovery had already been effected at the instance of the\nappellant herein, before the arrest of A-5. Holding that once the\nprosecution had been able to prove the recovery of the weapon of offence\nat the instance of the appellant and further, the forensic evidence brought\non record showed that the bullet found in the dead body had been fired\nthrough the said weapon, the said circumstance pointed towards the guilt\nof the appellant and accordingly, the learned ASJ convicted him under\n\nSection 302\n IPC while acquitting all the other accused persons.\nAggrieved by the said decision, A-4, the appellant herein has filed the\npresent appeal.\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 11 of 28\n\n ARGUMENTS ADVANCED\n\n22. The main thrust of the arguments addressed by Mr. Subodh K.\nPathak, learned counsel for the appellant is that the trial court grossly\nerred in convicting the appellant under \nSection 302\n IPC solely on the\nbasis of one circumstance, i.e. recovery of the weapon of offence. He\ncited \nSection 26\n of the Indian Evidence Act to contend that the\nconfession by an accused while in custody of the police is to be treated as\nan unreliable evidence and cannot be proved by the prosecution and only\nthat part of the disclosure statement of the accused can be proved which\nrelates distinctly to the discovery of evidence consequent upon\ninformation given by him, as contemplated under \nSection 27\n of the Act.\nHe disputed the stand taken by the prosecution that recovery of the\nweapon of offence was made on the appellant‟s disclosure statement and\nargued that the said recovery was doubtful and a planted one as the IO\ndid not prepare the site plan of the place of recovery and further, the\nsketch of the pistol and the magazine bears the signatures of only PW-19\nand PW-20, both of whom are police witnesses.\n\n23. It was pointed out that while the appellant had been arrested on\n29.12.2016, the recovery of the weapon of offence was allegedly made\ntwo days later, on 31.12.2016 and the weapon of offence was dispatched\nto the FSL for a report after a period of two months, i.e. on 1.3.2017, all\nof which casts a shadow of doubt on the recovery and the manner in\nwhich the investigation was conducted. Learned counsel also referred to\nthe disclosure statement of the co-accused, Prateek @ Bholu (A-2) made\non 26.12.2016 wherein, he had stated that he could get the weapon of\noffence recovered from Anu, a friend of the appellant and wondered why\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 12 of 28\n\n the police did not take any steps to get the weapon recovered at his\ninstance. He stated that even otherwise, it was the version of the\nprosecution itself that the weapon of offence was used by A-5 and fact of\nthe matter is that the said weapon was falsely planted on the appellant.\nLastly, it was argued that assuming without admitting that the weapon of\noffence used by A-5 was recovered on the disclosure made by the\nappellant, it is not even the case of the prosecution that he had used the\nsaid weapon of offence to fire at the deceased, for being convicted for his\nmurder.\n\nANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\n\n24. We have heard the arguments advanced by Mr. Subodh K. Pathak,\nlearned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Amit Gupta, learned APP and\ncarefully scanned the evidence brought on record in the light of the\nfindings returned in the impugned judgment.\n\n25. As noted above, the testimony of the sole eye witness, Ajeet\nKumar (PW-7) was discarded by the trial court on the ground that there\nwere several inconsistencies in his deposition and it was doubtful if he\nwas at all present at the scene of the crime. Once the testimony of PW-7\nwas discarded, all that is left for examination is the circumstantial\nevidence. The twin circumstances referred to by the learned ASJ is the\nfleeing away by the accused on motorcycles from the scene of crime and\nthe recovery of the weapon of offence. The first circumstance was\ndiscarded on account of the glaring contradictions in the testimony of the\npublic witnesses i.e., PW-10, PW-11 and PW-12, who claimed that they\nhad heard sounds of gunshots being fired and had witnessed the accused\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 13 of 28\n\n persons fleeing away from the scene of crime. The only other\ncircumstance relates to the recovery of the weapon of offence.\n\n26. Considering the fact that at no stage did the prosecution project a\ncase that it was the appellant, who had fired at the deceased, rather it was\ntheir consistent stand that it was A-5, who had taken out a pistol from his\npossession and fired at the victim on his chest and he had succumbed to\nthe said injuries, we are left wondering as to where was the occasion for\nthe trial court to have convicted the appellant for the offence under\n\nSection 302\n IPC on the ground of recovery of the weapon of offence?\nThe only role allegedly attributed to the appellant in the entire incident\nwas that he had grabbed the victim by his face and thrashed him by\nsaying that \"Tu hamare khilaf gawahi dega\". Thereafter, the appellant\nalongwith the other accused persons had started beating Jeet, who tried to\nsave himself by running towards a nearby country liquor shop. On\nreaching near the said country liquor shop, the appellant and the other\naccused persons had again caught hold of Jeet and thrashed him. The\nprosecution version has consistently been that it was A-5, who had taken\nout a pistol and fired at Jeet. That being the admitted case of the\nprosecution throughout and the trial court having acquitted A-5 for the\noffence punishable under \nSection 302\n IPC, the conviction of the\nappellant for the said offence is not sustainable only on the basis of\nalleged recovery of the weapon of offence on his disclosure statement.\n\n27. We are, therefore, in complete agreement with the submission\nmade by learned counsel for the appellant that there was no occasion for\nthe trial court to have convicted the appellant on the sole circumstance of\nrecovery of the weapon of offence on the basis of his disclosure\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 14 of 28\n\n statement when, it was never the prosecution case that the appellant was\nthe one, who was in possession of the pistol on that day and had fired at\nthe deceased with the said weapon. When as per the case of the\nprosecution, A-5 was in possession of the weapon of offence and he had\nfired on the deceased, it is hard to digest that A-5 would have handed it\nover to the appellant.\n\n28. The view expressed above is also fortified on a scrutiny of the\nquestions put to the appellant under \nSection 313\n Cr.PC. It was not the\nversion of the prosecution that he had pulled out a pistol and fired at the\ndeceased. The only circumstance alleged against the appellant was\nregarding his presence at the scene of the crime alongwith the co-\naccused, where he had allegedly threatened the deceased and given him\nkicks and fist blows. In fact, it was the case of the prosecution that A-5\nhad pulled out a pistol and fired on the chest of the deceased whereafter,\nthe appellant and the other co-accused had fled from the spot on\nmotorcycles. A specific suggestion on these lines was made to the said\neffect to A-5, while recording his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C.\n\nNO SUBSTANTIVE CHARGE FRAMED AGAINST THE\nAPPELLANT UNDER SECTION 302 IPC\n\n29. Though no argument has been advanced before us by the learned\ncounsel for the appellant on the absence of a substantive charge framed\nagainst the appellant under \nSection 302\n IPC, we would be failing in our\nduty if we overlook the said error committed by the trial court. A glance\nat the charges framed against the accused, as reproduced hereinabove,\nclearly brings out that all the accused were charged for harbouring a\ncommon intention of causing the death of the deceased, an eye witness in\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 15 of 28\n\n case FIR No.382/2016, PS Mahindra Park, for the offence punishable\nunder \nSection 302\n IPC read with \nSection 34\n IPC. No substantive charge\nwas framed against any of the accused individually. Considering the fact\nthat the remaining accused, A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-5 have been acquitted\nfor the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC and their acquittal has not been\nchallenged by the State by filing an appeal, and further, taking note of the\nfact that all the accused were collectively charged for the offence under\n\nSection 302\n IPC read with \nSection 34\n IPC and not individually, it is not\nunderstood as to how could the appellant be convicted under \nSection 302\n\nIPC simpliciter. This, in our opinion, is an error that goes to the root of\nthe matter.\n\n30. The patent fallacy of convicting an accused for a substantive\noffence without there being any charge framed against him, has been\nrepeatedly highlighted by the Supreme Court in a catena of decisions. \nIn\n\nNanak Chand vs. State of Punjab\n reported as AIR 1955 SC 274, the\nappellant along with six other co-accused had been charged for\ncommitting offences under Section 148 and Section 302 read with\n\nSection 149\n IPC and the trial court had acquitted three of the six accused\nwhile convicting the appellant therein and three others for the offences\nreferred to hereinabove. In the appeal filed against \nthe said judgment\n, the\nHigh Court had acquitted three of the remaining accused of the offence\nunder \nSection 302\n IPC read with \nSection 34\n IPC but convicted the\nappellant alone for the substantive offence under \nSection 302\n IPC. In\nview of the fact that no separate charge had been framed by the trial\ncourt under \nSection 302\n IPC, the Supreme Court held that the High Court\ncould not have convicted the appellant for the said offence. Rejecting the\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 16 of 28\n\n plea of the prosecution that non-framing of a substantive charge against\nthe appellant was an error in framing of charge that was a curable\nirregularity, it was held as follows:-\n\n \"13...................In the present case, however, there\n is no question of any error, omission or\n irregularity in the charge because no charge under\n \nsection 302\n of the Indian Penal Code was in fact\n framed. \nSection 232\n of the Code of Criminal\n Procedure permits an appellate court or a court of\n revision, if satisfied that any person convicted of\n an offence was misled in his defence in the absence\n of a charge or by an error in the charge, to direct\n a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in\n whatever manner it thinks fit. In the present case\n we are of the opinion that there was an illegality\n and not an irregularity curable by the provisions\n of \nsections 535\n and \n537\n of the Code of Criminal\n Procedure. Assuming, however, for a moment\n that there was merely an irregularity which was\n curable we are satisfied that, in the circum-\n stances of the present case, the irregularity is not\n curable because the appellant was misled in his\n defence by the absence of a charge under \nsection\n 302\n of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n 14. By framing a charge under section 302,\n read with \nsection 149\n of the Indian Penal Code\n against the appellant, the Court indicated that it\n was not charging the appellant with the offence of\n murder and to convict him for murder and\n sentence him under \nsection 302\n of the Indian\n Penal Code was to convict him of an offence with\n which he had not been charged. In defending\n himself the appellant was not called upon to meet\n such a charge and in his defence he may well\n have considered it unnecessary to concentrate on\n that part of the prosecution case.............\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 17 of 28\n\n 31. \nIn \nSuraj Pal vs. State of U.P.\n reported as AIR 1955 SC 419, where\ntwenty accused including the appellant therein had been charged with\noffences under \nSections 147\n, \n323\n/\n149\n, \n307\n/\n149\n and \n302\n/\n149\n IPC and\nheld guilty by the trial court, in the appeal, the High Court set aside the\nconviction of ten of the co-accused. As for the remaining ten co-\naccused, the High Court opined that nine of them could only be\nconvicted under \nSections 323\n/\n149\n IPC, thus leaving the appellant therein,\nwho alone was held guilty of the substantive offence under Section 307\nand \nSection 302\n IPC. The said decision was challenged by the appellant\nbefore the Supreme Court that held that once specific charges had been\nframed, which referred to all the accused having acted together with a\ncommon intention of firing upon the deceased and there was no\namendment to the charge, the appellant could not have been convicted\nfor the substantive charge for the offence under \nSections 302\n and \n307\n\nIPC as if he was acting alone. Holding that such a course of action was\nnot legitimate, the Supreme Court observed as follows:-\n\n \"4......................The appellant might well have\n relied on the absence of any such amendment as\n being an indication that he was not called upon to\n defend himself on the footing of his being the\n author of the pistol fire. In a case so serious as\n that which involves the sentences of\n transportation for life, and of death, and\n particularly in a case like the present one, where\n the death sentence has been awarded in the trial\n court by distinguishing this appellant from all the\n other accused in respect of his individual act by\n way of pistol fire, it is difficult to say that the\n accused has not been prejudiced by the absence\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 18 of 28\n\n of specific charges under \nsections 307\n and \n302\n,\n Indian Penal Code.\n\n 5. Further, the medical evidence indicates\n that P.W. 2 as well as the deceased Surajdin had\n gun-shot wounds on their person. The evidence of\n the Doctor is to the effect that these wounds may\n have been caused by a country pistol which, it is\n alleged, the appellant had in his hand. It has been\n suggested on behalf of the defence that the\n Medical Officer was not competent to speak about\n it and that if the prosecution wanted to rely\n thereupon, they should have called an arms expert\n to speak to the same. Whether or not this comment\n is legitimate, it is clear that if the appellant is to be\n found directly responsible for inflicting the\n wounds, noted as gun-shot wounds by the Medical\n Officer, he might well have availed himself of the\n opportunity to elucidate, by cross-examination or\n positive defence, the nature of the firearm which\n would have caused the actual injuries found on the\n bodies of PW-2 and of deceased Surajdin. In all\n the circumstances above noticed, we are satisfied\n that the absence of specific charges against the\n appellant under \nsections 307\n and \n302\n, Indian\n Penal Code has materially prejudiced him. We\n must accordingly set aside the convictions and\n sentences of the appellant under \nsections 307\n and\n \n302\n of the Indian Penal Code..............\"\n\n (emphasis added)\n\n32. \nIn \nKrishna Govind Patil vs. State of Maharashtra\n reported as AIR\n1963 SC 1413, which is case of Section 302 read with \nSection 34\n IPC,\nthe Supreme Court made the following observations:-\n\n \"8.......While it acquitted Accused 1, 3 and 4 under Section\n 302, read with \nSection 34\n of the Indian Penal Code, it\n convicted Accused 2 under Section 302, read with \nSection 34\n,\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 19 of 28\n\n of the said Code, for having committed the offence jointly with\n the acquitted persons. That is a legally impossible position.\n When accused were acquitted either on the ground that the\n evidence was not acceptable or by giving benefit of doubt to\n them, the result in law would be the same: it would mean that\n they did not take part in the offence. The effect of the acquittal\n of Accused 1, 3 and 4 is that they did not conjointly act with\n Accused 2 in committing the murder. If they did not act\n conjointly with Accused 2, Accused 2 could not have acted\n conjointly with them.......\"\n\n33. \nIn \nBaul and Another vs. State of U.P.\n reported as AIR 1968 SC\n728, there were three accused charged with the offence under \nSections\n302\n/\n34\n IPC and the Sessions Court convicted all of them. In the appeal,\nthe High Court acquitted one of the accused and altered the sentence of\nthe other accused to Section 325 read with \nSection 109\n IPC. But the\nconviction of the third accused was altered from \nSections 302\n/\n34\n IPC to\n\nSection 302\n IPC simpliciter. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal of\nthe third accused by making the following observations:-\n\n \"7. No doubt the original prosecution case showed that\n Sadhai and Ramdeo both hit the deceased on the head with\n their lathies. One is tempted to divide the two fatal injuries\n between the two assailants and to hold that one each was\n caused by them. If there was common intention established\n in the case the prosecution would not have been required to\n prove which of the injuries was caused by which assailant.\n But when common intention is not proved the prosecution\n must establish the exact nature of the injury caused by\n each accused and more so in this case when one of the\n accused has got the benefit of the doubt and has been\n acquitted. It cannot, therefore, be postulated that Sadhai\n alone caused all the injuries on the head of the deceased.\n Once that position arises the doubt remains as to whether\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 20 of 28\n\n the injuries caused by Sadhai were of the character which\n would bring his case within Section 302. It may be that the\n effect of the first blow became more prominent because\n another blow landing immediately after it caused more\n fractures to the skull than the first blow had caused. These\n doubts prompt us to give the benefit of doubt to Sadhai. We\n think that his conviction can be safely rested under \nSection\n 325\n of the Indian Penal Code, but it is difficult to hold in a\n case of this type that his guilt amounts to\n murder simpliciter because he must be held responsible for\n all the injuries that were caused to the deceased. We convict\n him instead of Section 302 for an offence under \nSection 325\n\n of the Indian Penal Code and set aside the sentence of\n imprisonment for life and instead sentence him to rigorous\n imprisonment for seven years.\"\n\n34. A similar view was expressed by the Supreme Court in \nSubran @\nSubramanian vs. State of Kerala\n reported as (1993) 3 SCC 32, as\nfollows:-\n\n \"11. Since, appellant 1 Subran had not been\n charged for the substantive offence of murder\n under \nSection 302\n IPC, even the trial court, which\n tried the six accused persons, was not justified in\n recording a conviction against him for the\n substantive offence of murder punishable under\n \nSection 302\n IPC after framing a charge against\n him for the offence under Section 302 read with\n \nSection 149\n IPC only. A person charged for an\n offence under \nSection 302\n IPC read with Section\n 149 cannot be convicted, of the substantive\n offence under \nSection 302\n, IPC without a specific\n charge having been framed against him as\n envisaged by law. Conviction for the substantive\n offence in such a case is unjustified because an\n accused might be misled in his defence by the\n absence of the charge for the substantive offence\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 21 of 28\n\n under \nSection 302\n IPC simpliciter and, therefore,\n in defending himself, he cannot be said to have\n been called upon to meet that charge and he\n could very well have considered it unnecessary to\n concentrate on that part of the prosecution case\n during the cross-examination of the prosecution\n witnesses. Therefore, the conviction of the first\n appellant for an offence under Section 302 was\n not permissible.\" (emphasis added)\n\n35. Again in \nState of West Bengal vs. Vindu Lachman Das Sakhrani @\nDeru\n reported as 1995 SCC (Crl) 175, a case where both, husband and\nwife were charged for committing an offence under \nSections 302\n/\n34\n IPC\nand the husband was acquitted but the wife was convicted for the\nsubstantive offence, the Supreme Court reiterated its stand that there\nbeing no charge under \nSection 302\n IPC simpliciter against the wife, she\ncould not have been convicted and in the following words:-\n\n \"4. .................Both\n husband and wife were charged\n with an offence under Section 302 read with\n \nSection 34\n I.P.C. The charge which was based on\n the common intention of the two failed with the\n acquittal of the husband and there being no charge\n under Section 302 simpliciter against the wife she\n could not be convicted. In any case there is no\n evidence on the record to show that she\n independently committed the offence.\"\n\n36. \nIn \nNallabothu Venkaiah vs. State of A.P.\n reported as (2002) 7 SCC\n117, the Supreme Court was faced with two questions of law. Firstly,\nwhether the appellant could be convicted under \nSection 302\n IPC without\nthe aid of \nSection 149\n IPC, in the absence of any substantive charge\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 22 of 28\n\n under \nSection 302\n IPC. Secondly, whether the appellant could be\nconvicted under \nSections 302\n/\n149\n IPC on selfsame evidence on the basis\nof which other accused were acquitted. After analyzing a catena of earlier\ndecisions on the above aspect, the law was distilled in the following\nwords:-\n\n \"24. On an analytical reading of a catena of decisions of\n this Court, the following broad proposition of law clearly\n emerges: (a) the conviction under Section 302 simpliciter\n without aid of Section 149 is permissible if overt act is\n attributed to the accused resulting in the fatal injury which is\n independently sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n cause the death of the deceased and is supported by medical\n evidence; (b) wrongful acquittal recorded by the High Court,\n even if it stood, that circumstances would not impede the\n conviction of the appellant under Section 302 read with\n \nSection 149\n IPC; (c) charge under Section 302 with the aid\n of Section 149 could be converted into one under Section\n 302 read with \nSection 34\n if the criminal act done by several\n persons less than five in number in furtherance of common\n intention is proved.\"\n\n37. In Koppula Jagdish @ Jagdish vs. State of A.P. reported as (2005)\n12 SCC 425, three accused persons were charged under Section 302 read\nwith \nSection 34\n IPC for sharing a common intention to commit the\nmurder of the victim. The trial court convicted all the three accused. In\nthe appeal, the High Court acquitted two of the accused and the\nconviction of the third accused was modified from Section 302 read with\n\nSection 34\n IPC to \nSection 302\n IPC simpliciter. In the above facts, the\nSupreme Court observed as under:-\n\n \"3. Undisputedly, all the three accused persons were charged\n under Section 302 read with \nSection 34\n IPC for sharing\n common intention to commit murder of the victim. The other\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 23 of 28\n\n two accused persons as stated above, have been already\n acquitted by the High Court. There is neither any allegation\n nor evidence that the appellant alone inflicted all the\n injuries or the fatal one. This being the position, the\n appellant could not have been convicted under Section 302\n simpliciter but could have been convicted only with the aid\n of \nSection 34\n IPC, which also is not possible in the case in\n hand as the other two accused persons with whom he could\n have shared the common intention have been already\n acquitted by the High Court. In our view, the High Court was\n not justified in convicting the appellant under \nSection 302\n\n IPC.\"\n\n38. \nIn Annareddy Sambasiva Reddy & Ors. Vs. State of Andhra\nPradesh reported as (2009) 12 SCC 546, placing reliance on its earlier\ndecisions in \nSurajpal\n (supra), \nPandurang, Tukia and Bhillia vs. State of\nHyderabad\n reported as (1955) 1 \nSCR 1083 and Nanak Chand\n (supra)\nreferred to \nSection 464\n of the Cr.P.C., which deals with the fact of\nomission of framing, or absence of, or error in charge, the Supreme Court\nheld that no straightjacket formula can be applied and every case must\ndepend on its merits. The essential and important aspect to be kept in\nmind is:- has omission to frame a specific charge resulted in prejudice to\nthe accused.\n\n39. In the instant case too, it is an admitted position that no separate\ncharge was framed against the appellant for the substantive offence under\n\nSection 302\n IPC. Once charges were framed by the trial court against all\nthe accused collectively and not individually and no effort was made by\nthe prosecution to approach the trial court for amending the charges as\nframed, the appellant alone could not have been convicted for a\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 24 of 28\n\n substantive offence under \nSection 302\n IPC. This is an illegality which is\nnot curable in the circumstances of the present case as in the absence of\nany substantive charge framed against him under \nSection 302\n IPC, the\nappellant was misled in his defence.\n\n40. Moreover, there is no direct evidence against the appellant for\nupholding his conviction under \nSection 302\n IPC. Mere recovery of the\nweapon of offence at the instance of the appellant cannot be the sole\npremise on which a judgment of conviction under \nSection 302\n IPC could\nbe recorded. It is too slender an evidence to hold him guilty of such an\noffence. This is particularly so when the fifth accused, who as per the\nprosecution, is the one who had pulled out the pistol and fired at the\ndeceased, has been acquitted by the learned ASJ. There is also no\nexplanation as to why despite the second accused, who was arrested on\n26.12.2016, three days before the appellant was arrested, stated in his\ndisclosure statement that he could get the weapon of offence recovered\nfrom a third person, no steps were taken in that direction. In the absence\nof any other evidence connecting the appellant with the commission of\nthe murder of the deceased, the trial court could not have proceeded to\nconvict him for the offence under \nSection 302\n IPC while proceeding to\nacquit the remaining accused. For the aforesaid reason too, the impugned\njudgment is unsustainable, being contrary to the settled legal position and\nis accordingly quashed and set aside alongwith the order on sentence.\n\n41. Before parting with this case, we would also like to highlight\nanother disturbing feature i.e., the lapse on the part of the trial court in\nomitting to frame a charge against the appellant and the fifth accused for\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 25 of 28\n\n the offence under \nSection 25\n of the Arms Act, particularly when the\noriginal charge-sheet and the supplementary charge-sheet filed in the\npresent case specifically refer to the provisions of \nSections\n302\n/\n411\n/\n120B\n/\n34\n IPC and \nSection 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act. Vide order\ndated 5.4.2017, the trial court had framed the charge against all the\naccused except for the fifth accused, Sandeep @ Bachha, who was yet to\nbe arrested, under \nSection 302\n IPC read with \nSection 34\n IPC, without\nmaking any reference to \nSections 25\n and \n27\n of the Arms Act. Even at the\nstage of amending the original charge vide order dated 19.5.2017, on\naccount of an error in recording the correct FIR number wherein the\ndeceased was an eye witness, the prosecution failed to point out that no\ncharge had been framed under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act, nor did\nthe trial court notice this omission or take any step to amend the charge.\nThe third occasion for amending the charge arose when the fifth accused\nwas finally apprehended and a supplementary charge-sheet was filed\nagainst him. Vide order dated 30.8.2017, charge was famed against the\nsaid accused, who as per the prosecution version, had taken out a pistol\nand fired at the chest of the deceased. Yet again, no charge was framed\nagainst him under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act. Even the sanction\norder dated 31.7.2017 under \nSection 39\n of the Arms Act for prosecution\nof the appellant and A-5 were not taken into account by the learned ASJ\nfor framing the charge against them under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms\nAct. Ironically, this lapse went undetected not only by the learned ASJ,\nbut also by the learned APP even during the course of the trial when PW-\n27, the sanctioning authority had appeared and testified that she had\naccorded sanction under \nSection 39\n of the Arms Act for the prosecution\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 26 of 28\n\n of the appellant and A-5 under \nSection 25\n of the Arms Act and the\nballistic expert witnesses, PW-22, PW-24 and PW-25 had appeared and\nproved their reports in respect of the weapon of offence, the empty\ncartridge etc. As a result of this negligence on the part of the prosecution\nand omission on the part of the trial court, no charge came to be framed\nagainst the appellant and A-5 under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act,\nwhich can only be described as a colossal blunder. Such a casual manner\nof framing the charge is a matter of serious concern.\n\n42. To sum up, here is a case where the appellant has been convicted\nunder \nSection 302\n IPC without any foundation laid for the said offence\nand though evidence was led by the prosecution for proving the charge\nunder \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act, it could not yield any result in the\nabsence of any charge framed against the appellant and A-5 for the said\noffence, due to gross negligence on the part of the prosecution,\ncompounded by the oversight attributable to the trial court. It is\nnoteworthy that the case was assigned to a Pilot Court and it was the\nsame Judicial Officer who had framed the charge and conducted the trial\nto finally deliver the impugned judgment of conviction.\n\n43. As a result of the above discussion, the appeal is allowed. The\nimpugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence qua the appellant\nare quashed and set aside. The appellant is acquitted for the offence\npunishable under \nSection 302\n IPC and is directed to be released\nforthwith, unless required to be detained in any other case. The bail bond\nand surety bond offered by him stand discharged. The appellant shall\nfulfill the requirements of \nSection 437-A\n of the Cr.P.C. at the earliest.\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 27 of 28\n\n 44. The appeal is disposed of. Trial court record be sent back forthwith\nalongwith a certified copy of this judgment. The Registry shall forward a\ncopy of this judgment to the concerned ACR Committee of the learned\nASJ for perusal.\n\n (HIMA KOHLI)\n JUDGE\n\n (VINOD GOEL)\n JUDGE\nMAY 15, 2019\nNA/rkb/ap\n\nCRL.A. 717/2018 Page 28 of 28",

Vide order\ndated 5.4.2017, the trial court had framed the charge against all the\naccused except for the fifth accused, Sandeep @ Bachha, who was yet to\nbe arrested, under \nSection 302\n IPC read with \nSection 34\n IPC, without\nmaking any reference to \nSections 25\n and \n27\n of the Arms Act. Even at the\nstage of amending the original charge vide order dated 19.5.2017, on\naccount of an error in recording the correct FIR number wherein the\ndeceased was an eye witness, the prosecution failed to point out that no\ncharge had been framed under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act, nor did\nthe trial court notice this omission or take any step to amend the charge.\nThe third occasion for amending the charge arose when the fifth accused\nwas finally apprehended and a supplementary charge-sheet was filed\nagainst him. Vide order dated 30.8.2017, charge was famed against the\nsaid accused, who as per the prosecution version, had taken out a pistol\nand fired at the chest of the deceased. Yet again, no charge was framed\nagainst him under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms Act. Even the sanction\norder dated 31.7.2017 under \nSection 39\n of the Arms Act for prosecution\nof the appellant and A-5 were not taken into account by the learned ASJ\nfor framing the charge against them under \nSections 25\n/\n27\n of the Arms\nAct. Ironically, this lapse went undetected not only by the learned ASJ,\nbut also by the learned APP even during the course of the trial when PW-\n27, the sanctioning authority had appeared and testified that she had\naccorded sanction under \nSection 39\n of the Arms Act for the prosecution"
