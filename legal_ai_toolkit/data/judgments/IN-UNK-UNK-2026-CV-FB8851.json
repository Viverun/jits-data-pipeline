Anilkumar, Senior PCGC for R-1&2)\n The application having been heard on 20.07.2016, the Tribunal\non 11.8.2016 delivered the following:\n ORDER\n\nPer: Justice N.K. Balakrishnan, Judicial Member\n\n Annexure A4 promotion order dated 01.04.2013 is under\n\nchallenge in this case, in so far as Respondent No. 3, 4 & 5 are concerned\n\nas they were promoted enbloc as Ammunition Mechanic-I (AM-I) in\n\nreservation quota. The applicants commenced service as Semi-Skilled\n\nlabourers. They belong to general category (UR). Respondents 3, 4, and\n\n5 commenced service much later as semi-skilled labourers. They belong\n\fto SC category. The next promotion post is Ammunition Mechanic II\n\n(Skilled); Method of appointment being promotion, subject to passing of\n\nqualifying test.\n\n2. Respondents 3, 4 and 5 and other candidates of SC/ST category\n\nwere granted accelerated promotion applying roster point reservation.\n\nTheir seniority in the cadre of AM-II were reckoned taking note of their\n\nofficiating in that cadre. The applicant and other UR candidates were\n\npromoted on later dates and their seniority was reckoned on the date of\n\nofficiation. Thus, respondent No. 3, 4 and 5 and other SC candidates\n\nwere granted accelerated seniority as well. The applicants, respondents\n\n3, 4 and 5 and other candidates on passing departmental test were\n\nempanelled for promotion to the cadre of AM-I. Serial No. 1 to 19 in\n\nthat panel were treated as UR candidates and were granted promotion as\n\nAM-1 without application of roster point reservation. Respondent No. 3,\n\n4 and 5 were promoted enblock treating them as candidates of reserved\n\ncategory and thereby excess promotions of candidates belonging to\n\nSC/ST were made when 25 posts were filled. If post-based roster is\n\napplied strictly, then point numbers 7, 15 and 20 have to be filled by\n\nappointing SC category candidates; if 25 posts are filled up, and point\n\nNo. 14 must be given to ST candidate taking note of the seniority in the\n\ncadre. Thus, according to the applicant point No. 7 is to be filled by\n\npromoting Shri T.N. Surendran (SC); point No. 14 to be filled up by\n\fShri P.R. Purushothaman (ST); point No. 15 to be filled up by promoting\n\nShri E. Ramachandran (SC) and point No. 20 should be filled up by\n\npromoting Shri N.V Babu (SC).\n\n3. Thus the applicants contend that Respondent No. 3, 4 and 5 and\n\nother SC/ST candidates are not entitled to get the accelerated seniority in\n\nview of the law laid down by the Apex Court in R.K. Sabharwal v.\n\nState of Pujab & Ors. b�\u0013 AIR 1995 SC 1371. According to the applicant\n\nin a post based reservation roster issued in purported implementation of\n\nthe judgment in Sabharwal (supra), in a cadre of 27, point Nos. 7, 15,\n\n20, 27 are reserved to be filled up by promoting SC candidates and point\n\nNos. 14 is reserved to be filled up by promoting ST candidates. Since\n\npoint Nos. 1, 2 & 3 are already occupied by employees of previous\n\nrecruitment, the rotation has to start from point No. 4; in a post based\n\nreservation roster. Going by the seniority list, (Annexure A-6) the post\n\nof AM-1 must be filled by appointing Shri P.S. Vikraman (SC) at point\n\nNo. 1, Shri T.N. Surendran (SC) at point No. 6, Shri P.R. Purushothaman\n\n(ST) at point No. 15, Shri E. Ramachandran (SC) at Sl. No. 11 and Shri\n\nN.V. Babu (SC) at Sl. No. 27. Challenging the appointment evidenced\n\nby Annexure A-4 to the extent of respondents 4 and 5 this application\n\nhas been filed.\n\n\f4. The gist of the contention raised by the respondents is stated as\n\nunder:-\n\n As per Office Memorandum dated 10.08.2010, it was clarified\n\nthat SC/ST candidates appointed by promotion on their own merit and\n\nseniority and not owing to reservation or relaxation of qualification will\n\nbe adjusted against unreserved points of reservation roster irrespective of\n\nthe fact whether the reservation was made by selection method or non-\n\nselection method (vide Annexure R-1). Annexure R-1 was issued as\n\ndirected by the C.A.T. Madras Bench in O.A No. 900/2005. That\n\ndecision was upheld by the High Court of Madras. Thus the respondents\n\nare bound to implement the order of the Government. There were 24\n\nvacancies available in which 3 vacancies were reserved for SC\n\ncandidates, 2 vacancies for ST candidates and 19 vacancies for UR. The\n\nsenior most 19 individuals in AM-II, who fulfilled the eligibility criteria\n\nfor promotion were considered for 19 UR posts. Those 19 individuals\n\nwere promoted on their own merits and not going by reservation roster,\n\nirrespective of the fact whether the promotion is made by selection\n\nmethod or non-selection method. The reserved vacancies of SC category\n\nwere filled up from those SC candidates, who have completed the\n\nrequisite qualifying service and also passed the departmental qualifying\n\ntests. ST vacancies could not be filled up due to non-availability of\n\feligible candidates in that category. The respondents contented that the\n\nclaim made by the applicant is devoid of merit and they pray for the\n\ndismissal of the Original Application.\n\n5. In MA No. 342/2016, which is actually an application to accept\n\nadditional document, the applicant has raised certain additional points\n\nwhich are to be treated as rejoinder. The total cadre strength in the grade\n\nof AM-1 is admittedly 27; three senior most incumbents in the cadre of\n\nAM-II had already been promoted namely Shri T. Vasudevan Unni (SC)\n\nShri M.V. Radhakrishnan and Shri N.V. Yacob and they are already in\n\nposition. Therefore, 24 vacancies remained unfilled. The post-based\n\nreservation roster was introduced as per O.M dated 02.07.1997 which\n\nwas done as directed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sabharwal's case\n\n(supra). Instead of strictly adhering to the post-based roster as directed\n\nin Sabharwal's case, the first 19 posts were filled up by promoting the\n\nsenior most personnel and the last three vacancies were filled up by\n\njunior most Scheduled Caste candidates. It actually violates the\n\nreservation roster.\n\n6. In the additional reply statement filed by the respondents, it is\n\nstated that the promotion to the post of AM-1 was made on the basis of\n\navailability of post-based reservation roster. In the cadre strength of 27\n\nposts of AM-1, 22 points are earmarked for unreserved, 3 for SC and 2\n\ffor ST; out of this 3 individuals had occupied in 2003 UR points;\n\nremaining 19 UR, 3 SC and 2 ST were vacant as on 01.01.2013. Hence,\n\n19 UR points were filled from eligible employees strictly as per their\n\nposition in the seniority list. Remaining 3 SC points were filled from the\n\nnext senior eligible candidates as per regular roster. Hence, the\n\npromotion made at Annexure A-4 in the post of AM-1 is strictly in\n\naccordance with the existing rules. The principle that SC/ST candidates\n\nappointed by promotion on their own merit and seniority, and not owing\n\nto reservation and relaxation of qualifications, will be adjusted against\n\nUR points of reservation roster is fully complied with. It fully satisfies\n\nthe dictum laid down by the Apex Court in Sabharwal's case. Hence, the\n\nrespondents prayed for dismissal of the application.\n\n7. The point for consideration is whether Annexure A-4\n\npromotion order is in compliance with the principle laid down in\n\nSabharwal's case and whether a proper post-based roster has been\n\nprepared by the respondents in tune with the directions contained in\n\nSabharwal's case followed by the Apex Court in the subsequent\n\ndecisions.\n\n8. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and\n\nhave also gone through the pleadings and records.\n\n9. Prior to the pronouncement of the judgment by the Apex Court\n\fin Sabharwal's case, vacancy based rosters were prescribed in order to\n\nimplement the Government's policy relating to reservation of jobs for\n\nSC/ST and candidates belonging to OBC. But the Apex Court in\n\nSabharwal's case held that the reservation of jobs for SC/ST/OBC should\n\napply to posts and not to vacancies. It was further held that the vacancy\n\nbased rosters can operate only till such time as the representation of\n\npersons belonging to the reserved categories, in a cadre reaches the\n\nprescribed percentage of reservation. It was held by the Apex Court in\n\nSabharwal (supra)..\n\n '5. When a percentage of reservation is fixed in respect of a\n particular cadre and the roster indicates the reserve points,\n it has to be taken that the posts shown at the reserve points\n are to be filled from amongst the members of reserve\n categories and the candidates belonging to the general\n category are not entitled to be considered for the reserve\n posts. On the other hand the reserve category candidates\n can compete for the non-reserve posts and in the event of\n their appointment to the said 356 posts their number cannot\n be added and taken into consideration for working out the\n percentage of reservation. \nArticle 16(4)\n of the Constitution\n of India permits the State Government to make any\n provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in\n favour of any backward class of citizen which, in the\n opinion of the State is not adequately represented in the\n Services under the State. It is, therefore, incumbent on the\n State Government to reach a con- clusion that the backward\n class/classes for which the reservation is made is not\n adequately represented in the State Services. '\n\nIt was further held that:\n\n '..........When the State Government after doing the\n necessary exercise makes the reservation and provides\n the extent of percentage of posts to be reserved for the\n said backward class then the percentage has to be\n\f followed strictly. The prescribed percentage cannot be\n varied or changed simply because some of the members\n of the backward class have already been\n appointed/promoted against the general\n seats. .....................'\nIt was also held that:\n\n 'the fact that considerable number of members of a\n backward class have been appointed/promoted\n against general seats in the State Services may be a\n relevant factor for the State Government to review\n the question of continuing reservation for the said\n class but so long as the instructions/ Rules\n providing certain percentage of reservations for the\n backward classes are operative the same have to be\n followed.' It was further held that 'despite any\n number of appointment/promotees belonging to the\n backward classes against the general category posts\n the given percentage has to be provided in\n addition...........' We, therefore, see no force in the\n first contention raised by the learned counsel and\n reject the same.\n\n10. In purported implementation of the judgment in Sabharwal,\n\nAnnexure A7, the post based roster instead of vacancy based roster was\n\nissued by DoPT O.M No. 36012/12/2/96/Estt. dated 02.07.1997.\n\nSpecific reference has been made in this O.M about the judgment\n\nrendered by the Constitution Bench in Sabharwal's case as to how the\n\nroster has been prepared. The fact that persons belonging to the reserved\n\ncategories who are appointed on the basis of merit - and not on account\n\nof reservation - are not to be counted towards the quota meant for\n\nreservation was also noted in Annexure A-7. It was done with a view to\n\nbringing the policy of reservation in line with the law laid down by the\n\fHon'ble Supreme Court. It was decided that in the existing 200 points,\n\n40 points and 120 points vacancy based rosters are ordered to be\n\nreplaced by post based rosters. All Ministries and Authorities were\n\ndirected to prepare the respective rosters based on the principle\n\nelaborated in the explanatory note given in that O.M. It was done in\n\nterms of the directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nSabharwal. Paragraph 4 of the Annexure A-7 reads:\n\n 'The principle for preparing the rosters elaborated upon\n in the Explanatory Notes are briefly recapitulated\n below:\n\n (a) since reservation for OBC does not apply in\n promotions, there shall be separate rosters for direct\n recruitment and for promotions;\n\n (b) The number of points in the roster shall be equal to\n the number of posts in the cadre. In case there is any\n increase or decrease in the cadre strength in future, the\n rosters shall be expanded/contracted correspondingly.\n\n (c) Cadre, for the purpose of a roster, shall mean a\n particular grade and shall comprise the number of posts\n to be filled by a particular mode of recruitment in terms\n of the applicable recruitment rules. Thus, in a cadre of,\n say, 200 posts, where the recruitment rules prescribe a\n ratio of 50:50 for direct recruitment and promotion, two\n rosters - one for direct recruitment and one for\n promotion (when reservation in promotion applies) -\n\n each comprising 100 points shall be drawn up on the\n lines of the respective model rosters.'\n\nIn para 5 it is stated thus:\n\n 'At the stage of initial operation of a roster, it will be\n necessary to adjust the existing appointments in the\n roster. This will also help in identifying the\n excesses/shortages, if any, in the respective categories in\n the cadre. This may be done starting from the earliest\n appointment and making an appropriate remark -\n 'utilised by SC/ST/OBC/Gen.', as the case may be,\n against each point in the rosters as explained in the\n\f explanatory notes appended to the model rosters. In\n making these adjustments, appointments of candidates\n belonging to SCs/STs/OBCs which were made on merit\n (and not due to reservation) are not to be counted\n towards reservation so far as direct recruitment is\n concerned. In other words, they are to be treated as\n general category appointments.\n\n 5. While cadre is generally to be construed as the\n number of posts in a particular grade, for the purpose of\n preparation of roster, it shall comprise posts required to\n be filled by a particular mode of recruitment in terms of\n the applicable recruitment rules. To illustrate, in a\n cadre comprising 200 posts, where the recruitment rules\n prescribe a ratio of 50:50 for direct recruitment and\n promotions, the roster for direct recruitment shall have\n 100 points and that for promotion shall have 100 points\n\n - thus making a total of 200.\n\n 10. The roster is to be operated on the principle of\n replacement and not as a 'running account' as hitherto.\n\n In other words, the points at which reservation for\n different categories applies are fixed as per the roster\n and vacancies caused by retirement, etc., of persons\n occupying those points shall be filled by appointment of\n persons of the respective categories.'\n\n It was further explained by Annexure A-9 O.M dated\n\n11.07.2002 that:\n\n '...........While it is clear from the O.M dated 02.07.1997 that\n the SC/ST/OBC candidates appointed by direct recruitment\n on their own merit and not owing to reservation will be\n adjusted against unreserved points of the reservation roster,\n doubts have been raised about SC/ST candidates promoted\n on their own merit. It is hereby clarified that:\n\n (i) The SC/ST candidates appointed by promotion on their\n own merit and not owing to reservation or relaxation of\n qualifications will not be adjusted against the reserved\n points of the reservation roster. They will be adjusted\n against unreserved points......'\n\n11. As per O.M dated 31.01.2005, it was clarified that O.M dated\n\f11.07.2002 (Annexure A9) takes effect only from the date of its issue;\n\nthat is; from 11.07.2002 but however in cases where SC/ST candidates\n\nwere promoted on their own merit before 11.07.2002 and were adjusted\n\nagainst unreserved points, that need not be reopened.\n\n12. According to the respondents, the post of AM-1 was made on\n\navailability of the post based roster points. It is not disputed that the\n\ncadre strength is 27. It is also not disputed that out of this three\n\nindividuals had already been in position and so these roster points would\n\nstart from No. 4. According to the respondents, there should be 19 UR\n\npoints, 3 SC points and 2 ST points, which were vacant as on\n\n01.04.2013. They assert that since 19 UR points were filled from the\n\neligible employees under UR and as they were fitted in their position in\n\nthe seniority list, and since the remaining three SC points were filled\n\nfrom the next senior eligible SC candidates as per regular roster,\n\nAnnexure A4 order is perfectly correct. But the gravamen the of the\n\ncontention raised by the applicants is that 3 SC candidates were given\n\nappointment en bloc without following the post-based roster points as\n\ndirected in Sabharwal (supra). Though it can be contended that the\n\npercentage of reservation would remain satisfied by appointing 19\n\npersons under UR, 3 under SC that is not what was required to be done\n\nas per Sabharwal. There is no dispute regarding the fact that the SC/ST\n\fcandidates appointed by promotion on their own merit and seniority and\n\nnot owing to reservation and relaxation of qualifications will be adjusted\n\nagainst UR points of reservation roster. But the question is how the\n\nroster is to be prepared following the directions contained in Sabharwal.\n\nA model roster was actually appended to the O.M issued by the DoPT.\n\nBut according to the applicants, it was not strictly followed by the\n\nrespondents while issuing Annexure A-4 order. It is not the total number\n\nof UR or SC or ST that becomes relevant but the actual points where\n\nthose persons were fitted or given slots.\n\n13. Annexure A3 is the list as per which it can be seen that the first\n\nthree persons were already in position from the date of preparation of\n\nAnnexure A4. Therefore, the list is to start from point No.4. Annexure\n\nA1 is the model roster for promotion where the cadre has large number\n\nof posts. It is the admitted case that in AM-II, total number of posts is\n\n27. If so, the points Nos. 1, 14, 21 and 27 are to be occupied by SC\n\nwhereas point Nos. 15 is to be occupied by ST.\n\n14. \nIn \nUnion of India v. Virpal Singh Chauhan\n (1995) 6 SCC 684\n\nwhich followed R.K. Sabharwal and Ajit Singh Januja and Others v.\n\nState of Punjab and Others (1996) 2 SCC 715, it was made clear that\n\nthe candidates belonging to reserved category but selected/promoted on\n\ntheir own merit (and not on virtue of rule of reservation) shall not be\n\fcounted as reserved category candidates. It was also held that the\n\nexpression 'appointment' in the absence of any indication to the contrary\n\nincludes appointment by promotion. There is no dispute regarding the\n\nfact that at the stage of initial operation of a roster it is necessary to\n\nadjust the existing appointments in the roster which will help in\n\nidentifying the excesses/shortages in the respective category in the cadre.\n\nIt was stated that it has to be done starting from the earliest appointment\n\nand making an appropriate remark, utilised by 'SC/ST/OBC/Gen.' as the\n\ncase each may be in the rosters as explained in the explanatory notes\n\nappended to the model rosters.\n\n15. The Official Memorandum referred to earlier also makes it\n\npellucid that while making such adjustment, appointment of candidates\n\nbelonging to SCs/STs/OBCs which were made on merit shall not to be\n\ncounted towards reservation so far as direct recruitment is concerned.\n\n16. Subsequent to the decision of the Madras High Court in \nUnion\n\nof India v. S. Kalgugasalamoorthy\n dated 31.01.2005 it was clarified that\n\nSC/ST candidates appointed by promotion on their own merit and\n\nseniority and not owing to reservation or relaxation of qualifications will\n\nbe adjusted against unreserved points of reservation roster, irrespective\n\nof the fact that whether the reservation is made by selection method or\n\nnon-selection method.\n It was also made clear that the directions given in\n\fSabharwal (supra) applies not only to direct appointments but also to\n\npromotions including the promotions on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n\n(non-selection method). The principle of not counting SC/ST candidates\n\npromoted/appointed on their own merit against reserved vacancies\n\nbecame applicable to all promotions including the promotion on the basis\n\nof seniority-cum-merit (non-selection method).\n\n17. The case for the respondents is that the SC/ST candidates were\n\nselected for promotion to the post, based on lesser benchmark on the\n\nrelaxed standard and lesser period of qualifying service bringing them in\n\nzone of consideration because of the reason of their being SC/ST\n\ncategory. Only in such cases they will be deemed as promoted against\n\nreserved vacancies. Here, that question did not arise at all. It was only a\n\ncase of appointment by promotion and therefore, the comparative\n\nassessment based on merit had no role to play in this case. So far as the\n\nactual position in this case is concerned, the total strength in the cadre of\n\nAmmunition Mechanic Grade AM-1 is admittedly 27. It is also not in\n\ndispute that the senior most incumbents had already been promoted\n\nnamely Shri Vasudevan Unni, Shri M.V Radhakrishnan and Shri N.V\n\nYacob and they were already in position. Therefore, only 24 vacancies\n\nremained unfilled. The computation, therefore, should start from the\n\nfourth point. There can also be no doubt, that as directed by the\n\fConstitution Bench in Sabharwal a post based reservation roster is to be\n\nmaintained. Based on the model reservation roster it must also be noted\n\nthat point No. 7, 15 20 and 27 are reserved to be filled up by promoting\n\nreserved SC candidates and point No. 14 is reserved to be filled up by\n\npromoting the ST candidate.\n\n18. As per the draft seniority list (Annexure A6) it can be seen that\n\nShri V.S. Vikraman, who is shown as No.1, as per the roster should\n\noccupy the fourth point. Though he is a SC candidate, he comes under\n\nthe UR and so it should not be counted towards SC quota.\n\n19. The 2nd person in the seniority should occupy the 5 th place.\n\nThere is no dispute regarding that fact. It is occupied by Shri N.M Philip.\n\nShri P.K. Vijayan, who is the 3rd man in Annexure A-6 (who is to occupy\n\nthe 6th point) is a ST candidate. Since 6 th point is not one reserved for\n\nST, Shri P.K. Vijayan should be reckoned as coming under UR\n\ncategory. The 7th point is reserved for SC candidate. The person, who is\n\nin that position is Shri I.V. Sasidharan. Since he is not a SC candidate,\n\nthe senior most SC candidate (Shri T.N. Surendran), who is otherwise\n\noccupying the 9th place should occupy the 7th point. Therefore, Shri I.V\n\nSasidharan, Shri P.R Sanadhanan and Shri K.S Haridas who are to\n\noccupy the points 8, 9 and 10 would come under UR category though\n\namong them, 9 and 10 are OBC candidates.\n\n\f20. There is no reservation for OBC in the matter of promotion.\n\nShri V. Gopalakrishnan who is just below is to be put in the roster point\n\nto occupy point No. 11. Shri K.K. Sasidharan, Shri P.C.\n\nMadhusoodhanan Sl. Nos. 9 and 10 are to occupy roster points 12 and\n\n13. Then comes the 14th roster point which is reserved for ST\n\ncandidates. The senior most ST candidate (Shri Purushothaman who is\n\nat Sl. No. 15) is to occupy point No. 14. Then the 15 th roster point is to\n\nbe reserved for SC. Therefore, the 15th roster point which is to be\n\noccupied by the SC candidate was to be filled up by promoting Shri E.\n\nRamachandran. But it is stated that he subsequently retired on\n\nsuperannuation.\n\n14. Annexure A-4, the promotion order which was directed to take\n\neffect from 01.04.2013 would show that Shri N.V. Babu, Shri V.T.\n\nAyyappankutty and Shri C.K. Valsalan who are SC candidates, are en\n\nbloc given appointment at points 20, 21 and 22 without putting them in\n\nthe respective slot as per the nodal roster issued by the DoPT pursuant to\n\nthe direction issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sabharwal (supra). As\n\nper Annexure A6 seniority list Shri N.V. Babu, is at Sl. No. 27. He is to\n\nbe filled at slot No. 20 as per the post-based roster. Sl. Nos. 19, 20, 21,\n\n22 and 23 are to be placed at roster points 21 to 25. If so, Shri E.\n\nGodfred, the 2nd applicant who is at Sl. No. 24 is to be given the slot -\n\froster point No. 26. Shri Ayyappankutty, is shown at Sl. No. 30 and\n\nShri C.K. Valsalan is at Sl. No. 32. They are SC candidates. Shri\n\nAyyappankutty has to occupy the 27th roster point meant for SC. The\n\ncontention raised by the respondents that since 19 UR points were filled\n\nup from eligible employees as per their position in the seniority list and\n\nthe remaining 3 SC points were filled from the next senior most SC\n\ncandidates cannot hold good since the roster should denote with respect\n\nto SC/ST points. It is not intended to have a promotion or appointment,\n\nwhich cannot be en bloc as done by the respondents as the post based\n\nrosters are to be prepared and maintained by the respondents to effect\n\nappointment in view of the directions contained in Sabharwal and\n\nAnnexure A7 O.M issued by the DoPT.\n\n15. Respondents 3 to 5 did not enter appearance and no reply\n\nstatement was filed. As per Annexure A7, Shri V.T. Ayyappankutty and\n\nShri C.K. Valsalan are shown as Sl. No. 21 and 22. They are to be\n\nplaced at the respective roster points as per the roster points in tune with\n\nthe directions contained in Sabharwal and the subsequent O.M issued by\n\nDoPT. It has to be held that Annexures A3, A4 and A5 to the extend\n\nindicated above are liable to be set aside. Consequently the respondents\n\nare directed to effect promotion strictly in accordance with the directions\n\ncontained in R.K Sabharwal. They should prepare a post based roster\n\fstrictly in compliance with the directions contained in those judgments\n\nand the Official Memorandum referred to above. It is not mere\n\npercentage of reservation that is to be followed but the reserved\n\ncandidates are to be given the respective slots. What have been shown in\n\nAnnexure A4 and other documents relied upon by the applicants is that\n\nthree SC candidates were enbloc appointed at slots Nos. 20, 21 and 22 as\n\nshown in Annexure A4 but without following the directions to appoint\n\nthem at the respective roster points. That has affected the positions to be\n\noccupied by the applicants as well. Hence the respondents are directed to\n\nrecast the roster, effecting promotion to the respective slots from among\n\nthe candidates who are shown in the seniority list and in the light of\n\nwhat have been stated above. That seniority is to take effect from\n\n01.04.2013. This exercise should be done within three months from the\n\ndate of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\n18. The Original Application is disposed of as above. No order as\n\nto costs.\n\n Dated, this the 16th day of August, 2016)\n\n (Mrs. P. GOPINATH) (N.K.
