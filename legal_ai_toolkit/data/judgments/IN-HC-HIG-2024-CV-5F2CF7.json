Once the final hearing of the Suit began and the counsel for the\nplaintiff had made his submissions, the learned senior counsel for the\ndefendant nos. 1 and 2 pointed out that no submissions had been made\nby the learned counsel for the plaintiff on some of the prayers, while\nfor some of the prayers, there had been a shift in the stand of the\nplaintiff.\n\n3. On the objection being raised, the learned counsel for the\nplaintiff clarified the plaintiff's stand on the prayers being pressed in\nthe Suit, as is recorded in the Order dated 09.05.2023, which is\nreproduced herein below:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 3 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n\"1. The learned counsel appearing for the\nplaintiff submits that the plaintiff has not\npressed and is not pressing prayer (b) and (d)\nmade in the Suit.\n\n2. As far as prayer (f) is concerned, the „estate\nleft by Smt.AbnashKaur' mentioned in the\nprayer is restricted to the rental received by\nthe defendant no.1 for the property bearing\nno.3, South End Road, New Delhi (hereinafter\nreferred to as the 'Suit Property') after the\ndeath of Smt. Abnash Kaur in 1976 and till the\ndate of redemption of the mortgage in May\n1981, and no other estate.\n\n3. The above statement of the learned counsel\nfor the plaintiff was necessary to be recorded\nas in the plaint, various prayers and averments\nhave been made, on which no submissions\nwere made in the opening by the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff. While the learned\nsenior counsel for the defendant no.1 was\nmaking submissions, it was noticed that the\nsubmissions were being made on pleas that\nhad not been pressed by the learned counsel\nfor the plaintiff. It is only to clarify the\nposition, that this statement of the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff has been recorded\nand, therefore, the plaintiff shall be bound by\nthis order and the statement of the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff.\n\n4. Needless to state that the above statements\nby the learned counsel for the plaintiff are\nwithout prejudice to the rights and contentions\nof the defendants.\n\n5. The learned senior counsel for the\ndefendant no.1 points out that there is a\nSchedule attached to the plaint, which\nmentions other properties purportedly as\n'estate left behind by the deceased late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur'. In relation to this Schedule\nalso, no submission was made by the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff in the opening.\n\n6. The learned counsel for the plaintiff prays\nfor time to seek instructions if the plaintiff is\nstill pressing the reliefs sought in respect of\nthe other properties, movable and immovable,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 4 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\napart from the suit property. He also prays for\ntime to seek instructions on prayer (g) made in\nthe plaint.\"\n\n4. By a subsequent Order dated 19.07.2023, the statement of the\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff was recorded as under:\n\n\"1. Pursuant to the order dated 09.05.2023,\nthe learned counsel for the plaintiff, on\ninstructions, submits that the plaintiff, in the\npresent suit, is pressing only prayer (a), (c),\n\n(e), (f) (as restricted in terms of paragraph 2\nof the order dated 09.05.2023), (h), (i) and (j),\nand would not press prayer (b), (d) and (g)\nmade in the plaint.\n\n2. He further submits that as far as the\nschedule of properties attached to the plaint is\nconcerned, the plaintiff restricts the claim only\nto the property bearing no. 3, South End Road,\nNew Delhi, and gives up all claims against the\nother moveable and immoveable properties\nmentioned in the Schedule, and does not seek\npartition of these properties.\n\n3. The plaintiff shall file an affidavit in the\nabove respect, within a week.\"\n\n5. The present plaintiff, Mr.Gurnir Singh Gill, filed an affidavit\ndated 26.07.2023, clarifying his restricted claim in the Suit. The\nrelevant portions of the same are reproduced as under:\n\n\"7. That accordingly, I state that the\nDeponent/Plaintiff shall be only pressing\nprayer (a), (c), (e), (f), (h), (i) and (j), and\nwould not be pressing prayer (b), (d) and (g)\nmade in the plaint.\n\n8. I further state that as far as the Schedule of\nProperties attached to the Plaint is concerned,\nthe Deponent/Plaintiff restricts the claim only\nto the property bearing no. 3, South End Road,\nNew Delhi and rental/profits earned\ntherefrom, and is therefore, relinquishing all\nthe claims against the other moveable and\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 5 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nimmoveable properties mentioned in the\nSchedule and does not seek partition of these\nproperties.\n\n9. I further state that as far as prayer (f) is\nconcerned, the 'estate left behind by Smt.\nAbnash Kaur\" mentioned in the prayer is\nrestricted to rent received / profits earned by\nthe Defendant No.1. for the Property bearing\nNo. 3, South End Road, New Delhi [hereinafter\nreferred to as the Suit property] after the death\nof Smt. Abnash Kaur in 1976 and till the date of\nredemption of mortgage in May 1981, and no\nother estate.\"\n\n6. This Court, therefore, proceeded to hear the submissions of the\nparties on these modified prayers and restricted claims of the plaintiff.\n\nCase of the plaintiff:\n\n7. It is the case of the plaintiff that late Smt.Abnash Kaur was the\nelder sister of the plaintiff, the defendant no.1, and the defendant no.3;\nmother of the defendant no.5; and aunt of the defendant no.2 and the\ndefendant no.4. She was married to late Seth Shiv Prasad on\n27.06.1953, and the defendant no.5 was born out of the said wedlock\non 11.05.1955. This was the second marriage of late Seth Shiv Prasad,\nwho had been blessed with seven sons from his first wife.\n\n8. The plaintiff asserts that out of the amounts gifted by late Seth\nShiv Prasad to late Smt. Abnash Kaur, she purchased a property\nbearing No.3, South End Road, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as\nthe 'Suit Property') for a total sale consideration of Rs.2,50,000/- vide\nSale Deed dated 18.01.1956 registered as Document No.215 in\nAdditional Book No.1, Volume No.354 on Pages 117 to 138 on\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 6 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n30.01.1957 in the Office of the Sub-Registrar, New Delhi (Ex. PW-\n4/1), thereby becoming the absolute owner of the Suit Property.\n\n9. The plaintiff asserts that by her last Will dated 06.02.1973 (in\nshort, 'Will') (Ex. PW-4/2), late Smt. Abnash Kaur bequeathed the\nSuit Property and all other movable and immovable assets in favour of\nthe plaintiff and the defendants, with each having 1/6th share in the\nsame. The original plaintiff, Sh.Ajit Singh, was appointed as the\nExecutor of the said Will by late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\n10. The plaintiff further asserted that on the death of late Seth Shiv\nPrasad, who passed away on 24.05.1957, disputes arose between late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur and her step-sons (sons from the first marriage of\nlate Seth Shiv Prasad). There was also an Order of Attachment dated\n07.07.1960 of the Suit Property passed by the Collector, Delhi (Ex.\nPW-4/7) for recovering the tax payable by 'Seth Shiv Prasad HUF'. In\norder to save her property from her step-sons and also from\nattachment, late Smt. Abnash Kaur entered into a fictitious lease of the\nSuit Property with the defendant no.1 vide Lease Agreement dated\n18.11.1958. The plaintiff asserts that this Lease Agreement was\nfictitious and was never acted upon; the possession of the Suit\nProperty was never delivered to the defendant no.1, and late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur remained in possession thereof.\n\n11. The plaintiff asserts that in February 1961, late Smt. Abnash\nKaur let out the Suit Property to the Vietnam Embassy, though in the\nname of the defendant no.1, on leave and license basis, and late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur was receiving the rent for the same from the said\nEmbassy. Later, she let out the Suit Property on leave and licence\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 7 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nbasis with effect from 01.01.1964 to the trade representative of the\nGerman Democratic Republic (hereinafter referred to as 'G.D.R.\nEmbassy'), though again in the name of defendant no.1. The plaintiff\nasserts that the last leave and licence agreement with the G.D.R.\nEmbassy, entered in November, 1974 for the period from 01.01.1975\nto 31.12.1979 at Rs.11,000/- per month was executed by him as the\nGeneral Attorney of the defendant no.1, on instructions from late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur. The plaintiff asserts that the G.D.R. Embassy made the\nfull and final payment of the rentals for the said period of 5 years, in\nadvance, in the name of defendant no.1 to the plaintiff, as was desired\nby late Smt. Abnash Kaur, and the said amount was later paid by the\nplaintiff to late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\n12. The plaintiff further asserts that late Smt. Abnash Kaur had also\ntaken a loan of an amount of Rs.1,98,000/- against the Suit Property\nby mortgaging the same in favour of Smt. Sushila Daphtary and\nMr.Anil Daphtary (in short, 'Daphtarys') vide Mortgage Deeds dated\n19.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/42) and 24.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/43). As late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur was unable to repay the said loan and interest\naccrued thereon, the Daphtarys filed a Suit, being Suit No. 282/1967,\ntitled 'Shrimati Sushila Daphtary & Anr. v. Shrimati Abnash Kaur\n& Ors.', seeking recovery of the said loan amount and foreclosure of\nthe mortgage. A Preliminary Decree dated 29.01.1971 was passed in\nfavour of Daphtarys and against late Smt. Abnash Kaur, thereby\ndirecting late Smt.Abnash Kaur to pay a sum of Rs.1,98,000/- as\nprincipal amount and interest @ 7.5% per annum thereon from the\ndate of the mortgage till the date of its realisation.

Abnash\nKaur through LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and Anr. During the\npendency of the said appeal, late Smt. Abnash Kaur passed away on\n10.06.1976. On the basis of her Will, the parties to the present Suit\nwere substituted against her in the appeal.\n\n13. During the pendency of the said appeal, the parties entered into\na compromise on 20.02.1978, and a Compromise Decree dated\n20.02.1978 (Ex. PW-4/DX8) was passed. Based on the said\nCompromise Decree, vide Order dated 08.05.1981 (Ex. DW-1/45), an\napplication, being C.M. No. 323/1981 (Ex. PW-4/DX9), filed by the\nparties under\nOrder XXI Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure\n, 1908\n(in short, '\nCPC\n') was allowed; the satisfaction of the decree was\nrecorded; and the mortgage deeds and other title documents were\nreleased in favour of the defendant no.1. It was also recorded that the\napplicant therein, that is, the defendant no.1, will be subrogated to the\nrights of the mortgagees in accordance with the terms of the said\nCompromise Decree.\n\n14. The plaintiff asserts that on 04.05.1983, he addressed a notice to\nSh. G.C. Mittal, Advocate, who, he claims, was advising and looking\nafter the interest of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, thereby calling upon him\nto disclose the documents of settlement/lease that had been executed\nby the defendant no.1 with the G.D.R. Embassy with respect to the\nSuit Property. The plaintiff claims that the defendant no.1, however,\nrefused to render the account of the rent received from the G.D.R.\nEmbassy, and started claiming that she alone was entitled to receive\nthe rent.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 9 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n15. The plaintiff claims to have issued a notice even to the G.D.R.\nEmbassy, asking the Embassy to pay the rent to him instead of to the\ndefendant no.1. He, however, claims that the Embassy refused to\ncomply with the same. The G.D.R. Embassy is claimed to have\nvacated the Suit Property on 01.11.1990.\n\n16. The plaintiff asserts that, in fact, after discussions and meetings\nbetween the plaintiff and the defendant no.1, the parties to the present\nSuit arrived at a settlement, the terms whereof were circulated by the\ndefendant no.1 to the plaintiff vide Letter dated 12.02.1991 (Ex. PW-\n4/27). However, soon thereafter, the defendant no.1 herself refused to\nadhere to the terms of the said settlement.\n\n17. The plaintiff claims that the defendant no.1 had invested the\nrental income from the Suit Property in other businesses and,\ntherefore, is liable to account for the same.\n\nCase of the defendant nos.1 and 2:\n\n18. The defendant no.1 filed her written statement wherein she\ndenied the contents of the plaint, and claimed that the Suit is barred by\nlimitation.\n\n19. The defendant no.1 further claimed that by redeeming the\nmortgage, she had become the subrogate mortgagee in possession of\nthe Suit Property and was entitled to keep the possession thereof. She\nfurther claimed her rights as a lessee.\n\n20. The defendant no.1 also denied sending the Letter dated\n12.02.1991 (Ex. PW-4/27), which, according to the plaintiff, recorded\nthe terms of the settlement arrived at between the parties.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 10 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n21. The defendant no.2 has adopted the written statement filed by\nthe defendant no.1.\n\nProceedings in the Suit:\n\n22. The original plaintiff, late Sh. Ajit Singh, passed away on\n12.10.2000. Thereafter, the defendant no.3, late Smt. Surjit Kaur Gill,\nfiled an application, being I.A. No.12533/2000, praying for her to be\ntransposed as a plaintiff on the basis of an alleged Will dated\n21.07.1997 of late Sh. Ajit Singh (Ex.

Mr. Manav Gupta, the learned counsel for the plaintiff, submits\nthat the purported Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958 was a sham document\nexecuted by late Smt. Abnash Kaur only to protect the Suit Property\nfrom any claim raised by her step-sons and also to avoid the\nattachment of the same towards the recovery of the Income Tax dues\nand the Order of Attachment dated 07.07.1960 (Ex.PW4/7) passed by\nthe Income Tax Authorities. He submits that in the year 1958, the\ndefendant no.1 was a minor, aged only 16 years.\n\n28. He submits that the purported Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958 has\nnot been filed on record by the defendant no.1.\n\n29. He submits that the defendant no.1 had also issued a Certificate\ndated 27.09.1963 (Ex.PW4/10), admitting that she has no right, title\nor interest in the Suit Property either as a tenant or as a lessee. He\nsubmits that it was also admitted by the defendant no.1 that the Suit\nProperty had been leased out to the Vietnam Embassy by late\nSmt.Abnash Kaur to protect the same from attachment by the Income\nTax Department and the false claim of her step-sons.\n\n30. On the denial by defendant no.1 of the Certificate dated\n27.09.1963 (Ex.PW4/10) and the Letter dated 12.02.1991 (Ex.PW-\n\n4/27), the learned counsel submits that the only evidence led by the\ndefendant no.1 in this regard was in the form of a private handwriting\nexpert, Mr.Deepak Jain (DW-3), whose evidence cannot be relied\nupon.

Amir Chand Jagdish\nKumar (Exports) Ltd. v. M/s. Hindustan Hing Supplying Co., (2010)\nSCC OnLine Del 4146. He submits that the report being relied upon\nwas a procured report and, therefore, no credence can be given to it.\n\n31. He submits that late Smt.Abnash Kaur had also entered into an\nAgreement to Sell dated 02.10.1963 (Ex.PW4/11) for the Suit\nProperty with one Sh. Jaswant Rai, wherein again, there was no\nmention of any lease deed having been executed by late Smt.Abnash\nKaur in favour of the defendant no.1.\n\n32. He submits that the defendant no.1 had executed a General\nPower of Attorney dated 27.06.1966 (Ex.PW4/12), appointing the\noriginal plaintiff, late Sh.Ajit Singh, as an Attorney inter alia to look\nafter the interest of the Suit Property. In discharge of the same, late\nSh. Ajit Singh had been entering into the lease documents with the\nEmbassy, though in the name of the defendant no.1.\n\n33. Drawing reference of this Court to an Affidavit dated\n12.02.1982 (Ex.PW4/13) executed by the defendant no.1, he submits\nthat in the said affidavit, the defendant no.1 had admitted that she had\nno income between the Assessment Years 1966-1967 to 1978-1979.\nHe submits that, therefore, the redemption of the Suit Property under\nthe Compromise Decree dated 20.02.1978 (Ex. PW-4/DX8) was from\nthe funds generated by the defendant no.1 from the Suit Property and\nnot from her own funds. He submits that since the property was\nredeemed from the estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, therefore, it was\nfor the benefit of all her legal heirs.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 14 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n34. He submits that, in any case, the defendant no.1 is only entitled\nto receive, from the other five family members, their proportionate\nshare, based on each family member's ownership share in the Suit\nProperty, of the money which she paid to redeem the mortgage from\nthe original mortgagees, that is, the Daphtarys; she cannot claim any\nexclusive right in the said property.\n\n35. Further, on the claim of the defendant no.1 that she is the\nsubrogate mortgagee of the Suit Property, the learned counsel for the\nplaintiff, by placing reliance on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in\nKrishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair (dead) by LRs. v. Padmanabha\nPillai (dead) by LRs. & Ors., (2004) 12 SCC 754, submits that the\nmortgage was redeemed by defendant no.1 for and on behalf of, and\nfor the benefit of, the other legal heirs of late Smt. Abnash Kaur,\nincluding the plaintiff. The only right of the redeeming family member\nis to seek contribution from the other family members and, at best, to\nhold possession of the property until the said contribution is made. He\nsubmits that the same is also recorded in the Compromise Decree\ndated 20.02.1978 (Ex.PW-4/DX8) and also in the Order dated\n08.05.1981 (Ex.DW-1/45) passed by this Court.\n\n36. He submits that though it is the case of the plaintiff that the\ndefendant no.1 had redeemed the Suit Property from the estate of late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur, through the rentals received by the defendant no.1,\nwithout prejudice, the plaintiff is willing to contribute towards the\nredemption amount in terms of the Judgment and Compromise Decree\ndated 20.02.1978 (Ex. PW-4/DX8) for its proportionate share of\n61.11% in the Suit Property.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 15 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n37. He submits that the defendant no.1, by way of an application\nfiled under\nOrder VI Rule 17 of the CPC\n, being I.A. 8144/2008, also\nsought to take a plea of adverse possession of the Suit Property. The\nsaid application was, however, dismissed by this Court, vide Order\ndated 03.11.2009; the appeal thereagainst was dismissed by a Division\nBench of this Court, vide Order dated 15.01.2010; and the Special\nLeave Petition filed by the defendant no.1 against the order of\nDivision Bench was also dismissed by the Supreme Court, vide Order\ndated 26.03.2010. He submits that the defendant no.1 also filed an\napplication under\nOrder VII Rule 11 of the CPC\n, being I.A.\n1604/1999, seeking rejection of the plaint on the ground of it being\nbarred by limitation, which was dismissed by this Court, vide Order\ndated 07.04.2008. The Division Bench of this Court, by its Judgment\ndated 27.01.2009 passed in FAO(OS) 290/2008, partially set aside the\norder of the learned Single Judge of this Court, however, the appeal\nagainst the order of the Division Bench, being Civil Appeal\nNo.8221/2011, was allowed by the Supreme Court vide Judgment and\nOrder dated 30.01.2014. The learned counsel for the plaintiff submits\nthat, therefore, the plea of the defendant no.1 that this Suit is barred by\nlimitation, cannot be accepted.\n\n38. He further submits that the limitation for the present Suit shall\nbe governed by\nArticle 65\nof the\nSchedule to the Limitation Act, 1963\n\n(in short, '\nLimitation Act\n'). He submits that since the Suit seeks\npartition and has been filed by one of the co-sharers, the possession of\nthe defendant no.1 shall be deemed to be a constructive possession of\nthe plaintiff. He submits that the cause of action for seeking partition\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 16 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nis a recurring cause of action, therefore, the Suit has been filed within\nthe period of limitation.\nIn support, he places reliance on the Judgment\nof the Supreme Court in Vidya Devi alias\nVidya Vati (dead) by LRs v.\nPrem Prakash & Ors.\n, (1995) 4 SCC 496; and of this Court in\n\nAishani Chandna Mehra v. Rajesh Chandna & Ors.\n, 2019 SCC\nOnLine Del 6718.\n\n39. The learned counsel for the plaintiff further submits that the\nclaim of the defendant no.1 that the defendant no.5 sold his interest in\nthe Suit Property to the defendant no.1 vide three Agreements to Sell\ndated 08.04.1993 (Ex.DW-1/33-35), also cannot be accepted as the\nfactum of such sale was not pleaded by the defendant no.1 in her\nwritten statement. He submits that there is also no proof of any\npayment being made against the alleged Agreements to Sell.\n\n40. In response to the submission of the learned senior counsel for\nthe defendant no.1 that the Suit is liable to be dismissed as it claims\npartial partition, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that this\nplea has been raised by the defendant no.1 only in the oral\nsubmissions and does not form a part of the pleaded case of the\ndefendant no.1. He submits that the defendant no.1 cannot be allowed\nto agitate a plea beyond the pleadings.\n\n41. He submits that, in any case, the principle of bar against partial\npartition is applicable only to Joint Hindu Family/coparcenary\nproperties and not to the properties which are co-owned by two or\nmore persons.\n\n42. He submits that even otherwise, there is no complete bar on\nseeking partial partition as the same would depend on the facts of each\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 17 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ncase and whether or not the other properties are, in fact, capable of\nbeing partitioned. He submits that in the present case, the right of late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur in the other properties is being denied by her step-\nsons. In fact, even the defendant no.1 in her written statement has\ncontended that late Smt. Abnash Kaur had not left behind any other\nasset/estate. He submits that, therefore, the bar against partial partition\nwould not be applicable to the facts of the present case.\n\n43.\nIn support of his above submission, he places reliance on the\nJudgments of the Supreme Court in\nB.R. Patil v. Tulsa Y. Sawkar &\nOrs.\n, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 240 and Radhey Shyam Bagla (Since\nDeceased) thr.\n\nLRs v. Smt. Ratni Devi Kahnani (Since Deceased\n)\nthrough Legal Representatives, 2014 SCC OnLine Del 7103; and of\nthis Court in\nHarish Chander Sharma & Ors. v. Deep Chand Ram\nDass and Sons & Ors.\n, 2008 SCC OnLine Del 1253;\nSardar Jarnail\nSingh & Anr. v. Sardar Amarjit Singh & Ors.\n, 2016 SCC OnLine\nDel 6666;\nAdarsh Pal Singh Randhawa & Anr. v. Amrit Bolaria &\nAnr.\n, 2020 SCC OnLine Del 2223;\nTarun K. Vohra v. Pravir K.\nVohra & Ors.\n, 2023 SCC OnLine Del 5662; and, Sh. Ved Parkash v.\nSh. Naresh Kumar & Ors., NC 2023:DHC:327.\n\n44. In answer to the submission of the learned senior counsel for\nthe defendant no.1 that the defendant no.1 is also a protected tenant\nunder the\nDelhi Rent Control Act, 1958\n(in short, '\nDRC Act\n'), the\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff submits that admittedly the Suit\nProperty was sub-leased for a rent of more than Rs.3,500/- per month\nand, therefore, in terms of\nSection 3(1)(c)\nof the DRC Act, it would\nnot be a protected tenancy. He further submits that this Suit itself will\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 18 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nact as an adequate notice for eviction, and that the defendant no.1 is\nnot entitled to any protection from eviction.\nIn support, he places\nreliance on the Judgments of this Court in\nP.S. Jain Co. Ltd. v. Atma\nRam Properties (P) Ltd.\n, 1996\nSCC OnLine Del 875 and Mir Abdul\nHai & Anr. v. Sanjeev Verma & Ors.\n, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11488.\n\n45. He submits that even otherwise, since the defendant no.1 is\nclaiming title to the Suit Property, in terms of\nSection 116\nof the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short, '\nEvidence Act\n') read with\n\nSection 111(g)\nof the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (in short, '\nTP\nAct\n'), the defendant no.1 is liable to be evicted from the Suit Property\nand she can no longer claim tenancy rights.\nIn support, he places\nreliance on the Judgments of this Court in S. Makhan Singh v. Smt.\nAmarjeet Bali, 2008 SCC OnLine Del 1188;\nNaeem Ahmed v. Yash\nPal Malhotra\n(deceased) Through Lr's &Anr., 2012 SCC OnLine\nDel 1189; and, Swarn Lata Agarwal & Anr. v. M/s. Narang\nMedicine Co., 2015 SCC OnLine Del 13575.\n\n46. In counter to the submission of the learned senior counsel for\nthe defendant no.1 that the Suit has abated as the plaintiff has not\nproved the Will dated 21.07.1997 (Ex. PW-2/1) of late Sh. Ajit Singh,\nthe original plaintiff, the learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that\nthis plea is again beyond the pleadings of the defendant no.1. He\nsubmits that late Sh. Ajit Singh had passed away on or before\n12.10.2000. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed an amended plaint, to which\nthe written statement was filed by the defendant no.1, however, no\nsuch plea or objection was taken by the defendant no.1 in the said\nwritten statement. He submits that the defendant no. 1, therefore,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 19 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ncannot be permitted to raise a defence not pleaded in the written\nstatement.\n\n47. He further submits that in any case, the present plaintiff,\nadmittedly, has 1/6th share in the Suit Property in his own independent\nright. In a Suit for partition, the defendants and the plaintiffs are all\nconsidered to be plaintiffs. In terms of Order XXII Rule 2 read with\n\nOrder XXII Rule 4 of the CPC\n, as the right to sue survives in the\npresent plaintiff, the Suit cannot abate.\n\n48. He submits that even otherwise, till date, there has been no\nobjection filed against the genuineness of the Will dated 21.07.1997\nleft behind by late Sh. Ajit Singh (Ex. PW-2/1). In Delhi, since it is\nnot mandatory to obtain probate of a Will, therefore, in absence of any\nchallenge to the said Will, it was not necessary for the plaintiff to lead\nfurther evidence on the genuineness of the Will. He submits that even\nthe sons of late Sh. Ajit Singh have not challenged the Will and one of\nthem has, in fact, appeared as a witness in the Suit in support of the\nplaintiff.\nIn support, he places reliance on the Judgment of Supreme\nCourt in\nKanta Yadav v. Om Prakash Yadav & Ors.\n, (2020) 14 SCC\n102, and of this Court in\nKamla Nijhawan v. Sushil Kumar Nijhawan\n& Ors.\n, 2014 SCC OnLine Del 2667 and, Sh. Harminder Khullar v.\nMrs. Swaran Kanta Juneja & Ors., 2013 SCC OnLine Del 2676.\n\n49. In response to the submission of the learned senior counsel for\nthe defendant no.1 that the plaintiff has failed to bring on record the\nlegal heirs of the defendant no.5, Mr.Kamal Kishore Bindal, the\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff reiterates that no such plea was taken\nby the defendant no.1 in her written statement. He submits that even\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 20 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\notherwise, the step-sons of late Smt. Abnash Kaur have not claimed\nany rights in the Suit Property. He submits that the Suit cannot be\ndismissed on this ground at this belated stage, and in case this Court\ndeems it necessary for the Legal Representatives of the defendant\nno.5, Mr.Kamal Kishore Bindal, to be impleaded, it can direct the\nsame or allow the plaintiff to implead them as parties.\nIn support, he\nplaces reliance on the Judgments of the Supreme Court in\nDaya Ram\n& Ors. v. Shyam Sundari & Ors.\n, (1965) 1 SCR 231; Dolai Maliko\n(Dead) Represented by his Legal Representatives & Ors. v. Krushna\nChandra Patnaik & Ors., (1966) Supp SCR 22;\nHarihar Prasad\nSingh & Ors. v. Balmiki Prasad Singh & Ors.\n, (1975) 1 SCC 212;\nSardar Amarjit Singh Kalra (dead) by LRs.\n\n&\nOrs. v. Pramod Gupta\n(Smt) (Dead) by LRs\n.\n\n& Ors., (2003) 3 SCC 272; and\nDelhi\nDevelopment Authority v. Diwan Chand Anand & Ors.\n, (2022) 10\nSCC 428.\n\nSubmissions of the learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1\nand 2:\n\n50. Mr.Sundaram, the learned senior counsel for the defendant\nnos.1 and 2, submits that the present Suit is liable to be dismissed for\nnon-joinder of the necessary and proper parties to the Suit. He submits\nthat the original defendant no.5, Mr.Kamal Kishore Bindal, who\nunfortunately passed away on or about 15.12.1995, was unmarried. He\nsubmits that in terms of\nSection 9\nof the Hindu Succession Act, 1956\n(in short, 'HSA'), his half-brothers, falling under Serial No. II of Class\nII Legal heirs in the Schedule to the HSA, would have precedence in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 21 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nsuccession over the brothers and sisters of his mother, late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur, who would fall under Serial No. IX of Class II Legal\nheirs in the Schedule to the HSA. He submits that despite the same, in\nI.A. 2816/1996, which was filed for the impleadment of the legal heirs\nof the late Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal, the plaintiff represented to the\nCourt that all the legal heirs of late Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal are\nalready on record, and based on this assertion, late Sh.Kamal Kishore\nBindal was deleted from the array of the parties to the Suit. He\nsubmits that in absence of all the legal heirs of late Sh.Kamal Kishore\nBindal, the Suit cannot proceed and is liable to be dismissed.\n\n51. He submits that even on the death of Sh. Ajit Singh, the original\nplaintiff, who unfortunately passed away on 12.10.2000, an\napplication, being I.A.12533/2000, was filed by Smt.Surjeet Kaur\nGill, the then defendant no.3, seeking her transposition as the plaintiff.\nIn the said application, she herself disclosed that late Sh.Ajit Singh\nhad left behind two adopted sons namely, Sh.Sanjay Singh and\nSh.Jasjeet Singh, as his legal heirs. However, she claimed her rights\nunder the purported Will dated 21.07.1997 of Sh. Ajit Singh (Ex. PW-\n2/1). This Court, vide its Order dated 04.12.2000, while allowing the\nsaid application, also observed that in case the said Will of Sh.Ajit\nSingh is found to be not genuine, the defendant nos.1 and 2 shall be at\nliberty to agitate the matter before the Court. He submits that though\nthe present plaintiff named the attesting witnesses to the alleged Will\ndated 21.07.1997 of late Sh. Ajit Singh (Ex. PW-2/1) in his list of\nwitnesses, however, he did not produce them in evidence. He submits\nthat, therefore, the plaintiff has failed to prove the said Will in terms\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 22 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nof\nSection 63\nof the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (in short, 'ISA'), and\n\nSection 68\nof the Evidence Act, and, therefore, in absence of the sons\nof late Shri Ajit Singh being impleaded, the Suit must fail. He places\nreliance on the Judgments of the Supreme Court in\n\nH.VenktachalaAyengar v. B.T. Thimmajamma\n, (1958) SCC OnLine\nSC 31;\nJanki Narayan Bhoir v. Narayan Namdeo Kadam\n, (2003) 2\nSCC 91, and, Murthy v. C.Saradambal, (2022) 3 SCC 209.\n\n52. He submits that even otherwise, by way of the said Will of late\nSh. Ajit Singh, Sh. Ajit Singh has bequeathed his estate to other\npersons as well, and these persons were also necessary parties to the\nSuit but have not been impleaded. Placing reliance on the Judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in\nKenchegowda v. Siddegowda\n, (1994) 4 SCC\n294 and of this Court in\nHari Om Sharma v. Ghan Shyam Dass\nSharma\n, 2018 SCC OnLine Del 7239, he submits that in absence of\nall the co-sharers, a decree of partition cannot be passed.\n\n53. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 also\nsubmits that it was the own case of the plaintiff that late Smt. Abnash\nKaur had left behind several properties, which are mentioned in the\nschedule attached to the plaint. The plaintiff, however, has confined\nhis claim of partition only to the Suit Property, as is recorded in the\norders dated 09.05.2023 and 19.07.2023 of this Court read with the\naffidavit dated 26.07.2023 of the present plaintiff. Placing reliance on\nthe Judgment of the Supreme Court in\nKenchegowda\n(supra), he\nsubmits that a Suit for partial partition is not maintainable in law and\nis liable to be dismissed.\n\nHe submits that the\nJudgment of B.R. Patil\n\n(supra), has carved out an exception to the above rule, however, the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 23 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nsame is not applicable to the facts of the present case as the plaintiff\nhas not referred to the said exception while deleting his claim of\npartition for the other properties.\n\n54. He further submits that the distinction being drawn by the\nplaintiff that the above rules are applicable only to Joint Hindu\nFamily/coparcenary properties, is also incorrect. He submits that\nwhere the succession is testamentary,\nSection 19\nof the HSA shall not\napply, as it applies to a case where two or more heirs succeed together\nto the property of an intestate, and in which case alone, they take the\nsaid property as tenants-in-common and not as joint tenants. He\nsubmits that the plaint is based on the averment that the plaintiff has a\nunity of title, unity of commencement of title, unity of interest, unity\nof equal share, and unity of possession and right of survivorship with\nthe defendants. Therefore, based on this averment of the plaintiff, this\nwould be a case of joint tenancy and not tenancy-in-common.\nIn\nsupport, he places reliance on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in\n\nSuresh Kumar Kohli v. Rakesh Jain & Anr.\n, (2018) 6 SCC 708.\n\n55. On the merits of the case, the learned senior counsel for the\ndefendant nos.1 and 2 submits that in terms of the Compromise\nDecree dated 20.02.1978 (Ex. PW-4/DX8), the defendant no.1 was\nsubrogated to the rights of the original mortgagees, that is, the\nDaphtary's, hence, the defendant no.1 was entitled to the delivery of\nthe mortgage deed and other title documents and was also entitled to\nrecover the decreetal amount from the other legal heirs of late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur. He submits that the said Decree has now attained\nfinality and cannot be challenged. He submits that, therefore, the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 24 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nsubmission of the plaintiff that no mortgage is created in favour of the\ndefendant no.1, is contrary to the said Decree. He submits that, that\nDecree cannot be challenged in this Suit. He places reliance on the\nJudgments of the Supreme Court in\nMohanlal Goenka v. Benoy\nKishna Mukherjee\n, (1952) 2 SCC 648;\nNarayana Prabhu\nVenkateswara Praphu v. Narayana Prabhu Krishana Prabhu\n(Dead) by Lrs.\n, (1977) 2 SCC 181; and,\nKalinga Mining Corpn. v.\nUOI & Ors.\n, (2013) 5 SCC 252, and on\nOrder XXIII Rule 3A of the\nCPC\n.\n\n56. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 further\nsubmits that the claim of the plaintiff that the mortgage was redeemed\nby the defendant no.1 from the rent received from the Suit Property\nfrom 1976 till the date of the redemption in 1981, is also false. Apart\nfrom there being no pleadings in this respect, it is the own case of the\nplaintiff in the plaint that the rent from 1975 to 1979 was received by\nlate Sh.Ajit Singh (the original plaintiff) and was handed over to late\nSmt.Abnash Kaur. He submits that the original plaintiff had also\nasserted that till the death of late Smt. Abnash Kaur on 10.06.1976,\nthe entire rental from the Suit Property was being received by late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur herself. He submits that as the mortgage was\nredeemed in 1981, as recorded in the order dated 08.05.1981 passed\nby this Court (Ex. DW-1/45), it could not have been redeemed from\nthe rentals of the Suit Property and, therefore, the plea taken by the\nplaintiff is false and liable to be rejected.\n\n57. He submits that the original plaint had stated that the mortgage\nwas redeemed from the income derived from the estate of late\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 25 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nSmt.Abnash Kaur, which is contradictory to the case that has now\nbeen contended by the plaintiff that the mortgage was redeemed from\nthe rent received from the Suit Property.\n\n58. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2\nsubmits that in his cross-examination, the present plaintiff (PW-4) has\nadmitted that neither he nor Sh. Ajit Singh took any steps to redeem\nthe mortgage or to pay the sum due to the defendant no.1. The only\nremedy now available to them is to file a suit for redemption of the\nmortgage along with the consequential relief of possession. However,\nsince the same has not been filed till date, it is now barred by the law\nof limitation.\n\n59. He further submits that under\nArticle 58\nof the\nLimitation Act\n,\nthe right to obtain the declaration begins when the right to sue first\naccrues, which, in this case, was when the order dated 08.05.1981 was\npassed by the Division Bench of this Court in RFA(OS) No. 11/1971,\ntitled Smt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and\nAnr., (Ex. DW-1/45). He submits that this is not a case of\nusufructuary mortgages and the period of limitation as provided under\n\nArticle 61\nof the\nLimitation Act\nhas, therefore, expired.\nIn support, he\nplaces reliance on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in\nSingh Ram\nv. Sheo Ram\n, (2014) 9 SCC 185.\n\n60. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 further\nsubmits that the plaintiff has also sought to impugn the status of the\ndefendant no.1 as a lessee of the Suit Property. He submits that the\nWill dated 06.02.1973 (Ex. PW-4/2) left behind by late Smt. Abnash\nKaur, which is the basis of the claim and the locus of the plaintiff to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 26 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nsue, itself admits to the tenancy in favour of the defendant no.1. He\nsubmits that the plaintiff, while attempting to derive benefit from the\nsaid Will, cannot assert that the lease, which has been acknowledged\ntherein, was a sham.\n\n61. He submits that even otherwise, there have been several\nproceedings in which not only late Smt. Abnash Kaur, but also Sh.\nAjit Singh, the original plaintiff, had admitted to the lease in favour of\nthe defendant no.1.\n\n62. He submits that even though the lease was admittedly in the\nknowledge of the original plaintiff, he did not file a Suit within the\nperiod of limitation to challenge the same. The Suit is, therefore,\nbarred by limitation.\n\n63. The learned senior counsel further submits that in terms of the\nLease Deed dated 18.11.1958, the defendant no.1 is a statutory tenant\nunder the\nDRC Act\n. He submits that since the present Suit is not based\non the termination of the said Lease Deed, therefore, the case of\neviction, which is now being setup by the plaintiff only during the\narguments, cannot be accepted.\n\n64. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 further\nsubmits that the reliance of the plaintiff on the alleged Certificate\ndated 27.09.1963 (Ex.PW4/10), to contend that the defendant no.1\nhad admitted that the said Lease Deed was a sham document, cannot\nbe accepted. He submits that the defendant no.1 had denied executing\nthe same and had even produced a Handwriting Expert, Sh. Deepak\nJain (DW-3), who had opined that the said document does not bear the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 27 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nsignatures of the defendant no.1, whereas the plaintiff did not produce\nany evidence to prove the said document.\n\n65. He submits that similarly, reliance cannot be placed on the\nterms and conditions of the alleged settlement dated 12.02.1991 (Ex.\nPW-4/27), alleged to have been addressed by the defendant no.1 to the\noriginal plaintiff, Sh.Ajit Singh. He submits that as Smt. Surjeet Kaur\nGill did not enter the witness box despite repeated opportunities and\nher evidence was finally closed vide Order dated 20.08.2014, the said\ndocument, therefore, remained unproved by the plaintiff. On the other\nhand, the defendant no.1, through the evidence of Sh. Deepak Jain\n(DW-3), who opined that the signatures were not written by the\ndefendant no.1, has proved that the said document was not executed\nby the defendant no.1.\n\n66. The learned senior counsel also submits that the only evidence\nled by the plaintiff is that of the present plaintiff, Sh.Gurnir Singh Gill\n(PW-2), whose testimony is only hearsay.\n\n67. He further submits that the plaintiff has not affixed proper court\nfee on the Suit. He submits that while the plaintiff has valued the\nmovable and immovable assets of late Smt. Abnash Kaur at Rs.75\ncrores, he has affixed the Court Fee of only Rs.19.50. He submits that\nthe claim of the plaintiff to be in constructive possession of the Suit\nProperty, also cannot be accepted.\n\nAnalysis and findings:\n\n68.

As the Suit is based on the registered Will dated 06.02.1973 of\nlate Smt. Abnash Kaur (Ex. PW-4/2), and since the said Will is not in\ndispute in the present Suit, at the outset, the contents thereof deserve\nto be noticed.\n\n70. In the said Will, late Smt. Abnash Kaur states that she owns in\nher name, and in the name of her benamidars, several movable and\nimmovable properties. Then, she goes on to refer to her shares in the\nLord Krishna Sugar Mills Limited and also mentions the dispute with\nrespect to the said shares. She also mentions inheriting 1/9th share of\nthe estate of her late husband, Seth Shiv Prasad, and the dispute that\nshe has with her step-sons regarding the same.\n\n71. She then mentions the Suit Property, and states that the\npossession thereof is with the defendant no.1, who is her tenant under\nthe Agreement/Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958 and is paying a rent of\nRs.1,500/- per month vide the Amended Agreement dated 12.01.1964.\nShe also mentions a charge created in favour of the defendant no.1\nunder the Agreement dated 18.11.1958, whereby she is liable to pay\n50% of the amount spent by the defendant no.1 on the renovation of\nthe said Suit Property, as and when the defendant no.1 vacates the\npremises.\n\n72. She also mentions about her jewellery and also about a loan\nextended by her to M/s Srichand Vishandass.\n\n73. She then bequeaths all her properties in favour of her son,\nMr.Kamal Kishore; her brother, who was the original plaintiff, Sh.Ajit\nSingh; her two sisters, Smt.Adarsh Kaur Gill, the defendant no.1, and\nSmt.Surjit Kaur Gill, (the original defendant no.3 who was transposed\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 29 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nas a plaintiff vide Order dated 04.12.2000); her niece, the defendant\nno.2, Ms.Noorien Kaur Gill; and her nephew, who is the present\nplaintiff, Sh.Gurnir Singh Gill, in equal shares, with each having a\n1/6th share in her estate.\n\n74. She appointed the original plaintiff- Sh.Ajit Singh as the sole\nExecutor and Administrator of her Will.\n\n75. At this point, it is apposite to note that she had expressly stated\nthat the Executor will first divide the properties that are not in\nlitigation and thereafter, shall divide the properties against which\nlitigation is pending, on the conclusion of such litigations.\n\n76. As noted hereinabove, the original plaintiff- Sh.Ajit Singh had\nfiled the present Suit as the Executor of the said Will of Smt.Abnash\nKaur, and also in his position as a beneficiary thereunder, inter alia\nclaiming a decree of partition of the estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\n77. In the present Suit, Sh.Ajit Singh has inter alia pleaded that the\ndefendant no.1 had invested huge amounts, which came in her hands\nfrom the estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, in the business started by\nher. He has further pleaded that the defendant no.1 also invested the\nrental income from the Suit Property in the said business. He has\nclaimed that one of the companies which had been started by the\ndefendant no.1 in Delhi in or about 1985 is known as M/s Nina\nGarments (Pvt.) Ltd. He has claimed that the defendant no.1 has\nfloated other companies as well by using the income from the estate of\nlate Smt. Abnash Kaur. He has given the details of such estate in the\nform of a schedule annexed to the plaint by making following\naverments:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 30 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n\"63.

Abnash Kaur, which were forming part of her estate, as is\nclaimed by the plaintiff, the present Suit now seeks only a partial\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 32 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\npartition of the estate of late Smt.Abnash Kaur and, therefore, is not\nmaintainable. As noted hereinabove, he has placed reliance on the\nJudgment of the Supreme Court in\nKenchegowda\n(supra).\n\n79.\nIn\nKenchegowda\n(supra), the Supreme Court has held that a\nSuit for partial partition, in absence of the inclusion of other joint\nfamily properties and impleadment of the other co-sharers, was not\nwarranted in law.\n\nWhile reiterating the said principle, in\nB.R. Patil\n\n(supra), the Supreme Court has held that though the law looks with\ndisfavour upon properties being partitioned partially, the principle that\nthere cannot be a partial partition at all is not an absolute one. Placing\nreliance on Mayne‟s „Treatise on Hindu Law & Usage‟ 17th Edition,\nparagraph 487, the Supreme Court has held that the rule against\npartial partition is not an inelastic rule, and a suit for partition may be\nconfined to division of property which is available at the time for\nactual division and not merely for division of status. The exception to\nthe rule would be where the property that has been omitted is not in\npossession of the coparceners and may consequently be deemed to be\nnot really available for partition, or where a property is not admitted to\nbe a joint property by all the parties to the Suit, and it is contended by\nsome of them that the property belongs to an outsider. I may quote\nfrom the Judgment as under:\n\n\"10. This is the state of the pleading and\nevidence in support of the existence of the\nproperty other than what has been scheduled\nby the plaintiffs and for which partition is\nsought. It is true that the law looks with\ndisfavor upon properties being partitioned\npartially. The principle that there cannot be a\npartial partition is not an absolute one. It\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 33 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nadmits of exceptions. In Mayne‟s „Treatise on\nHindu Law & Usage‟ 17th Edition, Paragraph\n487, reads as follows:\n\n\"487. Partition suit should embrace all\nproperty - Every suit for a partition\nshould ordinarily embrace all joint\nproperties. But this is not an inelastic\nrule which admits circumstances of a\nparticular case or the interests of justice\nso require. Such a suit, however, may be\nconfined to a division of property which\nis available at the time for an actual\ndivision and not merely for a division of\nstatus. Ordinarily a suit for partial\npartition does not lie. But, a suit for\npartial partition will lie when the portion\nomitted is not in the possession of\ncoparceners and may consequently be\ndeemed not to be really available for\npartition, as for instance, where part of\nthe family property is in in the\npossession of a mortgagee or lessee, or\nis an impartible Zamindari, or held\njointly with strangers to the family who\nhave no interest in the family partition.\nSo also, partial partition by suit is\nallowed where different portions of\nproperty lie in different jurisdictions, or\nare out of British India. When an item of\nproperty is not admitted by all the\nparties to the suit to be their joint\nproperty and it is contended by some of\nthem that it belongs to an outsider, then\na suit for partition of joint property\nexcluding such item does not become\nlegally incompetent of any rule against\npartial partition.\"\n\n11. In the facts of this case having noticed the\nstate of the pleadings and the evidence, we are\nof the view that the interest of justice lies in\nrejecting the appellant‟s contention. The\nappellant has not been able to clearly\nestablish the exact extent or identity of the\nproperty available by way of ancestral\nproperty. Despite claiming to having\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 34 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ndocuments relating to the properties and\nadmitting to having no difficulty to produce\nthem, he does not produce them. He is unable\nto even give the boundaries. It is obvious that\nhe does not claim to be in possession of the\nsaid properties even if it be as a co-owner on\nthe basis that it is ancestral property. His\nevidence discloses that in reality and on the\nground these properties could not be said to be\nactually available for the parties to the present\nsuit to lay claims over them. Properties not in\nthe possession of co-sharers/coparceners\nbeing omitted cannot result in a suit for the\npartition of the properties which are in their\npossession being rejected.\"\n\n80. The above exception was also noticed by a Division Bench of\nthis Court in Radhey Shyam Bagla (Since Deceased) thr.\nLRs\n\n(supra), wherein it was further held that the bar against partial\npartition would not apply where the properties are not established to\nbe joint in nature, that is, HUF or coparcenary assets, but are disputed\nor otherwise held commonly, and the exclusion of such properties\nwould not be fatal to the maintainability of the proceedings.\n\n81. A learned Single Judge of this Court applied the ratio of the\nabove Judgment in\nSardar Jarnail Singh & Anr.\n(supra), by holding\nas under:\n\n\"7. A Division Bench of this Court recently in\n\nRadhey Shyam Bagla v. Ratni Devi Kahnan\n,\nalso faced with a plea of the suit for partition\nbeing bad for the reason of being for partial\npartition, held (i) that subject to exceptional\ncircumstances, a suit instituted for partition\nshould include all the joint family properties;\n\n(ii) the general principle is that a cosharer\nfiling a suit for partition against the other co-\n\nsharers has to bring all the joint properties\ninto the hotchpot, failing which a suit may be\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 35 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ndismissed on the ground of partial partition as\nthe proper equity in a suit for partition will not\nbe possible if all joint properties are not\nbrought into the hotchpot; (iii) the normal rule\ngoverning suits for partition is that it has to\nincorporate all partible coparcenary property\nand should implead all those entitled to a\nshare; (iv) however this rule is not a rigid and\nan inflexible one; reliance was placed on Mst.\nHatesharKuer v. Sakaldeo Singh laying down\nthat the rule aims for preventing multiplicity of\nlegal proceedings which results if separate\nsuits were to be instituted in respect of\nfragments of joint estates and that normally it\nis more convenient to institute one suit for\npartition of all the joint properties for\nequitable distribution and adjustment of\naccounts-however this being a rule dictated by\nconsideration of practical convenience and\nequity, may justifiably be ignored when in a\ngiven case there are cogent grounds for\ndeparting from it; (v) however the said rule\napplies primarily to coparcenary property -\n\nwhere the parties are not coparceners but\ntenants in common, it makes a substantial\ndifference in the applicability of the rule as no\ncoparcener has a share in any particular\nproperty but there is no such basis for\napplication of the rule to property which is\nheld in common; (vi) a distinction has to be\nmade between jointly or commonly held\nproperty and coparcenary property; and, vii) a\nsuit for partition of a common property as\ndistinct from joint property is not liable to\ndismissal on the ground that all the joint\nproperty in respect of which partition may\nhave been sought have not been included.\n\n8. Applying the aforesaid law, I am of the\nopinion that the present suit for partition of\nproperty acquired by the parties hereto vide\nsale- deeds, in their own name is not bad for\nbeing for partial partition as the other\nproperties which have not been included have\nbeen acquired by the parties to this suit, not by\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 36 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nacquisition directly in their name, but by\ninheritance, jointly with others and which\nothers have nothing to do with the property to\nwhich this suit pertains.\"\n\n82. From the above, it is evident that the rule against\nmaintainability of a suit for partial partition applies only when\npartition is sought for HUF or coparcenary properties, and not where\nthe parties claim their right as tenants-in-common, because while all\ncoparcenary properties form a part of the common hotchpot and no\ncoparcener has a share in any particular joint family property,\nhowever, for commonly held properties there is no such basis of\napplication of the rule barring partial partition. At this point, it would\nbe apposite to ascertain the status of parties to the present Suit. The\nlearned senior counsel for the defendant nos. 1 and 2 has contended\nthat the parties to the present Suit have acquired the interest in the Suit\nProperty as joint tenants and not tenants-in-common.\n\n83. The Supreme Court in\nSuresh Kumar Kohli\n(supra), while\nexplaining the distinction between joint tenancy and tenancy-in-\ncommon, has held as under:\n\n\"14. The issue at hand is what would be the\nstatus of the succeeding legal representatives\nafter the death of the statutory tenant. In this\nregard, it would be worthy to discuss the two\ncapacities, viz. tenancy-in-common and joint\ntenancy, and the rights that one holds in these\ntwo different capacities. Fundamentally, the\nconcepts of joint tenancy and tenancy-in-\ncommon are different and distinct in form and\nsubstance. The incidents regarding the\ncotenancy and joint tenancy are different :\n\njoint tenants have unity of title, unity of\ncommencement of title, unity of interest, unity\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 37 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nof equal shares in the joint estate, unity of\npossession and right of survivorship.\n\n15. Tenancy-in-common is a different concept.\n\nThere is unity of possession but no unity of\ntitle, i.e. the interests are differently held and\neach co-tenant has different shares over the\nestate. Thus, the tenancy rights, being\nproprietary rights, by applying the principle of\ninheritance, the shares of heirs are different\nand ownership of leasehold rights would be\nconfined to the respective shares of each heir\nand none will have title to the entire leasehold\nproperty. Therefore, the estate shall be divided\namong the co-tenants and each tenant in\ncommon has an estate in the whole of single\ntenancy. Consequently, the privity exists\nbetween the landlord and the tenant in\ncommon in respect of such estate.\"\n\n84. This distinction was recently highlighted by the Division Bench\nof this Court in\nTarun K. Vohra\n(supra), wherein the Division Bench\nconsidered the effect of\nSection 19\nand\nSection 30\nof the HSA and\nheld that the property devolving on the heirs of a Hindu, whether or\nnot he/she dies intestate, devolves on the heirs as tenants-in-common\nand not as joint tenants. The Division Bench also opined that the\nquestion as to whether the property devolved on the parties in equal\nshares by virtue of a Will or on account of the deceased dying intestate\nis inconsequential to determine the nature of the properties in the\nhands of the parties. It was held that the rule against partial partition is\napplicable in respect of joint family properties or coparcenary\nproperties and not where the properties are held by the parties as\ntenants-in-common. I may quote from the Judgment as under:\n\n\"18. In the present case, there is no dispute\nthat the Suit Property is a self-acquired\nproperty of the parents of the parties. The\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 38 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nquestion whether it devolved on the parties in\nequal shares by virtue of the Will or on\naccount of Late Smt. Primla Vohra dying\nintestate is inconsequential to determine the\nnature of the properties in the hands of the\nparties.\n\n19. It is relevant to refer to\nSection 19\nand\n\nSection 30\nof the Hindu Succession Act, 1956\n(hereafter „the Act‟). The same are set out\nbelow:\n\n\"19. Mode of succession of two or\nmore heirs.- If two or more heirs\nsucceed together to the property of an\nintestate, they shall take the property,-\n\n(a) save as otherwise expressly\nprovided in this Act, per capita and\nnot per stirpes; and\n\n(b) as tenants-in-common and not as\njoint tenants.\n\n30. Testamentary succession.- Any\nHindu may dispose of by will or other\ntestamentary disposition any property,\nwhich is capable of being so\n[disposed of by him or by her], in\naccordance with the provisions of the\n\nIndian Succession Act, 1925\n(39 of\n1925), or any other law for the time\nbeing in force and applicable to\nHindus.\"\n\n20. A conjoint reading of\nSections 19\nand\nof\nthe Act makes it amply clear that the property\ndevolving on the heirs of a Hindu whether he/\nshe dies intestate, devolves on them as tenants-\nin-common and not as joint tenants.\n\n21. The question whether the heirs of a\ndeceased tenant inherit the statutory tenancy\nas tenants-in-common or as joint tenants has\nbeen a subject matter of much debate.\nIn\nH.C.\nPandey v. G.C. Paul\n, the Supreme Court held\nas under:\n\n\"4. It is now well settled that on the\ndeath of the original tenant, subject to\nany provision to the contrary either\nnegativing or limiting the succession,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 39 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nthe tenancy rights devolve on the heirs\nof the deceased tenant. The incidence\nof the tenancy are the same as those\nenjoyed by the original tenant. It is a\nsingle tenancy which devolves on the\nheirs. There is no division of the\npremises or of the rent payable\nthereof. That is the position as\nbetween the landlord and the heirs of\nthe deceased tenant. In other words,\nthe heirs succeed to the tenancy as\njoint tenants....\"\n\n22. In a later decision in Mst.\nSurayya Begum\nv. Mohd. Usman\n, the Supreme Court clarified\nas under:\n\n\"8. So far as\nSection 19\nof the Hindu\nSuccession Act, 1956, is concerned,\nwhen it directs that the heirs of a\nHindu dying intestate shall take his\nproperty as tenants-in-common, it is\ndealing with the rights of the heirs\ninter se amongst them, and not with\ntheir relationship with a stranger\nhaving a superior or distinctly\nseparate right therein. The\nrelationship between the stranger and\nthe heirs of a deceased tenant is not\nthe subject matter of the section....\"\n\n23. In case of a statutory tenancy, the same\ndevolves on the heirs as a joint tenancy vis-à-\nvis the landlord. However, as explained by the\nSupreme Court in Mst. Surayya Begum v.\n\nMohd. Usman inter se the heirs, inherit the\nproperty of the predecessor as tenants-in-\n\ncommon. In the present case, since there is no\ndispute that the Suit Property is a self-\n\nacquired property and had devolved on the\nparties in equal shares, the decision of the\nlearned Single Judge to pass a preliminary\ndecree and set down the matter for passing a\nfinal decree on the aforesaid basis cannot be\nfaulted.\n\n24.\nIn\nKenchegowda (Since Deceased) by LRs\nv.

The aforesaid decision was noted by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in Radhey Shyam\nBagla (Since Deceased) through\nLRs v. Smt.\nRatni Devi Kahnani (Since Deceased\n) through\nLrs.\n\nIn the said case, this Court also noticed\nthe decisions of the Karnataka High Court in\n\nSri Tukaram v. Sri Sambhaji\nas well as the\ndecision of the Calcutta High Court in\n\nSatchidananda Samanta v. Ranjan Kumar\nBasu\nwherein, the principle was accepted that,\nin a suit for partition of shares of members of\na joint family, it is necessary to bring all the\njoint properties into the hotchpot failing\nwhich, the suit would be for a partial partition,\nwhich is not maintainable. However, it is\nnecessary to note that in Mst.\nHateshar Kuer\nv. Sakaldeo Singh, the Supreme Court had\nobserved as under:\n\n\"The rule requiring inclusion of the\nentire joint estate in a suit for\npartition is not a rigid and in elastic\nrule which can admit of no exception.\nThis rule aims at preventing\nmultiplicity of legal proceedings\nwhich must result if separate suits\nwere to be instituted in respect of\nfragments of joint estates. Normally\nspeaking, it is more convenient to\ninstitute one suit for partition of all\nthe joint properties and implead all\nthe interested co-sharers so that all\nquestions relating to the share of the\nvarious co-owners and the equitable\ndistribution and adjustment of\naccounts can be finally determined.\n\nBut, this being a rule dictated by\nconsideration of practical\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 41 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nconvenience and equity may\njustifiably be ignored when, in a given\ncase there are cogent grounds for\ndeparting from it.\"\n\n26. Thus, the suit for partial partition would\nnot be proceeded with unless and until all\nother joint properties are brought into the\nhotchpot and all co-sharers are impleaded as\nparties. However, the said rule is applicable in\nrespect of joint family properties or\ncoparcenary properties and not where the\nproperties are held by the parties as tenants-\nin-common. This principle was noticed by the\nBombay High Court in\nSitaram Vinayak\nHasabnis v. Narayan ShankarraoHasabnis\n,\nwhere it was held as under:\n\n\"3. The rule is subject to exceptions\narising out of convenience and from\nother causes. But it applies primarily\nto coparcenary property. The parties\nin this case are not coparceners but\ntenants-in-common; and in our view\nthat may well make a substantial\ndifference in the applicability of the\nrule.\n\n*** *** ***\n.....We have not been shown any direct\nauthority, that a suit for partition of\ncommon property, not joint property,\nis liable to dismissal on the ground\nthat all the joint property in respect of\nwhich might have been brought, has\nnot been included. Shortly, we have\nnot been shown that the objection,\nfounded on what is usually described\nas the plea of partial partition is\navailable when a suit for division of\ncommon property, not joint property\nis in question.\"\n\n85. Applying the above principles to the facts of the present case, I\nfind no merit in the objection raised by the learned senior counsel for\nthe defendant nos.1 and 2. In the present case, the Suit prays for\npartition of the Suit Property, which is not HUF or coparcenary in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 42 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nnature, but rather, is in the nature of separate/self-acquired property of\nSmt. Abnash Kaur and has been bequeathed by her in favour of the six\nbeneficiaries under her Will dated 06.02.1973 (Ex. PW-4/2). The\nnature of the Suit Property being the separate/self-acquired property of\nSmt. Abnash Kaur is not disputed by any of the parties to the Suit.\nTherefore, the rule of bar against partial partition would not be\napplicable to the facts of this case.\n\n86. As far as the other properties, which have been bequeathed to\nthe parties under the said Will are concerned, the Will itself records\nthat the same are in dispute, particularly with the step-sons of late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur. Since it is not the case of the defendant nos.1 and\n2 that the other properties, apart from the Suit Property, are available\nfor partition, therefore, they cannot claim the rigid application of the\nrule against partial partition. In the facts of the present case, clearly\nthese other assets are not available to the parties for partition and,\ntherefore, it cannot be said that the present Suit is not maintainable on\nthe ground that it seeks partial partition of the estate of late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur or that it excludes from actual partition the other assets\nof late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\n87. That apart, the original plaintiff had filed the present Suit\nclaiming therein that the defendant no.1 had started a business from\nthe estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, and had also acquired several\nassets by investing the income from the estate of late Smt. Abnash\nKaur. In her written statement, the defendant no.1 denied these\nassertions of the plaintiff, and contended as under:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 43 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n\"38. Contents of Paragraph 38 of the plaint\nare wrong and are denied. Abnash Kaur left\nno estate except the suit property. All her\njewellery and cash had been misappropriated\nby the Plaintiff who, having become insolvent\nin 1958-59, basically spent his time frittering\naway the assets of Abnash Kaur and thereby\nreducing her to a state of penury. As stated\nabove Abnash Kaur could not pay the agreed\nrent of 1400/- p.m. and it was got reduced to\nRs. 1000/- p.m. from the Court of Rent\nController, Delhi.\n\nAbnash Kaur eventually became\ndependent upon answering defendant whose\nbusinesses alongwith her sister defendant no.3\nherein were flourishing by the this time.\n\n******\n\n61. Contents of Paragraph 61 of the plaint are\nwrong and are denied. There were no positive\nassets of Abnash Kaur. She died in debt. There\nwere several decrees against her when she\ndied. The Plaintiff had misappropriated all her\njewellery, and assets including cash. The\nassets that the answering defendant holds at\npresent are what she has earned from her\nbusinesses. In fact it was she who maintained\nAbnash Kaur during the latter‟s life time. This\nthe answering defendant did out of love and\naffection for her sister.\n\n61A. Contents of Paragraph 61A of the plaint\nare wrong and are denied. The allegations are\nvague and incorrect and the legal propositions\nare unsound and deserve immediate dismissal.\n\n*** *** ***\n\n63. Contents of Paragraph 63 of the Plaint are\nwrong and are denied. There is no positive\nestate left by Abnash Kaur as falsely alleged\nby the Plaintiff. The Estate Duty Return of\nAbnash Kaur is clear on this point.\"\n\n88. It is, therefore, the own case of the defendant no.1 that apart\nfrom the Suit Property, there is no other asset of late Smt. Abnash\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 44 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nKaur which is available to be partitioned. She has also denied the\nschedule attached to the plaint, which contains the list of properties\nallegedly forming the estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur. She is now,\ntherefore, estopped from contending that there were other assets left\nbehind by late Smt. Abnash Kaur which deserve to be partitioned, and\nthat in absence of the relief whereof, the present Suit is not\nmaintainable.\n\nThe Will of late Sh.Ajit Singh:\n\n89. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 has\ncontended that by the Order dated 04.12.2000, Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill\nwas transposed as a plaintiff in place of the original plaintiff- Sh. Ajit\nSingh, based on a purported Will dated 21.07.1997 (Ex.PW-2/1)\nexecuted by him, whereunder she had been appointed as an\nExecutor/Administrator. This Court, however, also clarified that if the\nsaid Will is found to be not genuine, then the defendant nos.1 and 2\nwould be at liberty to agitate the matter before this Court. The learned\nsenior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 has, therefore, submitted\nthat as Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill and the present plaintiff- Sh.Gurnir Singh\nGill, have not led any evidence to prove the said Will, in terms of\nSection 63 of the ISA and\nSection 68\nof the Evidence Act, therefore,\nthe Will remains unproved and the Suit is liable to be dismissed.\n\n90. While there is no doubt on the proposition that a Will must be\nproved in accordance with the above provisions of the ISA and the\nEvidence Act, and by adducing in evidence at least one attesting\nwitness to the Will, who would not only testify to the valid execution\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 45 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nof the Will but also to the sound and disposing state of mind of the\ntestator, and that the propounder of a Will must also remove any\nsuspicion on the due execution of the Will, however, at the same time,\nit must also be kept in mind that in Delhi there is no requirement for\nmandatorily obtaining a Probate/Letter of Administration of a Will.\nReference in this regard may be made to the Judgment of the Supreme\nCourt in\nKanta Yadav\n(supra).\n\n91. In the present case, there is no issue framed by this Court on the\ngenuineness of the Will dated 21.07.1997 (Ex.PW-2/1) of late Sh. Ajit\nSingh. In fact, the learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2\nhas been unable to show to this Court if the Will of late Sh. Ajit Singh\nwas ever disputed by the said defendants.\n\n92. Once there is no dispute raised to the said Will, it cannot be\nsaid, at this stage, that the Suit is not maintainable only because the\nplaintiff failed to lead any evidence to prove the Will dated\n21.07.1997 (Ex.PW-2/1) of late Sh. Ajit Singh. There was, in fact, no\nnecessity for the plaintiff to have led any such evidence in the facts of\nthe present case.\n\nNon-impleadment of necessary parties:\n\n93. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 has\nfurther contended that there were other beneficiaries, namely,\nSh.Kuldip Singh, Sh.Sanjay Singh, and Sh.Jasjeet Singh under the\nWill of late Sh.Ajit Singh. He has also contended that Smt.Surjit Kaur\nGill, in her application seeking transposition as a plaintiff, being I.A.\nNo.12533/2000, had herself disclosed that Sh.Ajit Singh had left\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 46 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nbehind two legal heirs, namely, Sh.Sanjay Singh and Sh.Jasjeet Singh,\nwho were his adopted sons. He also submits that as on the death of\nlate Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill, the present plaintiff, Sh.Gurnir Singh Gill,\ndid not seek his substitution as an Executor of the alleged Will of\nSh.Ajit Singh, therefore, on both counts the necessary parties are not\non record of the Suit.\n\n94. I again find no merit in the said contention. The Supreme Court\nin the case of\nShivshankara & Anr. v. H.P. Vedavyasa Char\n, 2023\nSCC OnLine SC 358, while considering similar facts, has held that the\nnon-impleadment of all legal representatives would not result in the\nabatement of the Suit if the estate of the deceased is substantially\nrepresented by other parties to the Suit. I may quote from the said\nJudgment as under:\n\n\"35. As noticed earlier, the appellants have\nalso contended that the suit ought to have been\nheld as abated against all the defendants\nowing to non-substitution of all the legal\nrepresentatives of the deceased defendant No.\n3 upon his death. This contention is bereft of\nany basis and merits and was rightly repelled\nby the courts below. In that regard it is to be\nnoted that the first appellant and deceased\nsecond appellant as also their father\nHanumaiah were all arrayed in the suit as\ndefendants and they were jointly defending the\nsuit. Upon the death of original third\ndefendant viz., Hanumaiah the original\ndefendants No. 1 and 2, who are sons of the\noriginal defendant No. 3 fully and\nsubstantially representing the joint interest\ncontested the suit and, thereafter, after\nsuffering an adverse judgment and decree in\nthe suit diligently preferred the appeal before\nthe High Court which ultimately culminated in\nthe impugned judgment and decree. Even\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 47 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nthereafter, obviously they are diligently\nprosecuting the joint interest, even if the\ncontention of joint interest is taken as correct,\nby filing the captioned appeal.\n\n36. In the contextual situation the following\ndecisions assumes relevance. The decision\nin Bhurey Khan v. Yaseen Khan (Dead) By\nLRs.9 was referred to in the impugned\njudgment by the High Court to reject the\naforesaid contention of the appellants therein\nviz. original defendant Nos. 1 and 2. In\nparagraph 4 of the decision in Bhurey Khan's\ncase, this Court held thus:--\n\n\"......the estate of the deceased was thus\nsufficiently represented. If the appellant\nwould not have filed any application to\nbring on record the daughters and the\nwidow of the deceased the appeal would\nnot have abated under\nOrder 22 Rule\n4 of the Code of Civil Procedure\nas held\nby this Court in\nMahabir Prasad v. Jage\nRam\n[(1971) 1 SCC 265 : AIR 1971 SC\n742]. The position, in our opinion, would\nnot be worse where an application was\nmade for bringing on record other legal\nrepresentatives but that was dismissed\nfor one or the other reason. Since the\nestate of the deceased was represented\nthe appeal could not have been abated.\"\n\n37.\nIn the decision in State of Andhra Pradesh\nthrough\nPrincipal Secretary v. Pratap\nKaran10\n, this Court held:--\n\n\"40. In the instant case, the plaintiffs\njoined together and filed the suit for\nrectification of the revenue record by\nincorporating their names as the owners\nand possessors in respect of the suit land\non the ground inter alia that after the\ndeath of their predecessor-in-title, who\nwas admittedly the pattadar and\nkhatadar, the plaintiffs succeeded the\nestate as sharers being the sons of\nkhatadar. Indisputably, therefore, all the\nplaintiffs had equal shares in the suit\nproperty left by their predecessors.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 48 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nHence, in the event of death of any of the\nplaintiffs, the estate is fully and\nsubstantially represented by the other\nsharers as owners of the suit property.\nTherefore, by reason of non-substitution\nof the legal representative(s) of the\ndeceased plaintiffs, who died during the\npendency of the appeal in the High\nCourt, entire appeal shall not stand\nabated. Remaining sharers, having\ndefinite shares in the estate of the\ndeceased, shall be entitled to proceed\nwith the appeal without the appeal\nhaving been abated. We, therefore, do\nnot find any reason to agree with the\nsubmission made by the learned counsel\nappearing for the appellants.\"\n\n38. We are of the considered view that the\nsame analogy is applicable in a case where\neven in the event of death of one of the\ndefendants, when the estate/interest was\nbeing fully and substantially represented in\nthe suit jointly by the other defendants along\nwith deceased defendant and when they are\nalso his legal representatives. In such cases,\nby reason of non-impleadment of all other\nlegal heirs consequential to the death of the\nsaid defendant, the defendants could not be\nheard to contend that the suit should stand\nabated on account of non-substitution of all\nthe other legal representatives of the deceased\ndefendant. In this case, it is to be noted that\nalong with the deceased 3rd defendant the\noriginal defendant Nos. 1 and 2 were jointly\ndefending their joint interest. Hence, applying\nthe ratio of the aforesaid decision and taking\ninto account the fact that the appellants/the\noriginal defendants No. 1 and 2 despite the\ndeath of original defendant No. 3 defended the\nsuit and preferred and prosecuted the first\nappeal. Upon the death of the second\nappellant the joint interest is being fully and\nsubstantially taken forward in this proceeding\nas well by the first appellant along with the\nsubstituted legal representatives of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 49 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ndeceased second appellant, we do not find any\nreason to disagree with the conclusions and\nfindings of the courts below for rejecting the\ncontention that suit ought to have held abated\nowing to the non-substitution of all the legal\nheirs of deceased third defendant against all\ndefendants. For the same reason, the\ncontention that the suit was bad for non-\n\njoinder of necessary parties of all his legal\nheirs/representatives also has to fail.\"\n\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n95. In the present case, in his Will dated 21.07.1997 (Ex.PW-2/1),\nlate Sh.Ajit Singh had appointed Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill, and in the event\nof her demise, Sh.Gurnir Singh Gill, as the Executor and\nAdministrator of his Will. Though, there were other beneficiaries\nunder the said Will, late Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill and Sh.Gurnir Singh Gill\nwere to act as the Executor of the said Will. Furthermore, the interests\nof Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill and Sh.Gurnir Singh Gill were not adverse to\nthat of late Sh.Ajit Singh, and the estate of late Sh.Ajit Singh was\nadequately represented by Smt.Surjit Kaur Gill and Sh.Gurnir Singh\nGill, being the executors of his Will. Therefore, the Suit cannot abate\nmerely for non-impleadment of all legal heirs of late Sh.Ajit Singh.\n\n96. Therefore, I find no merit in the objection raised by the learned\nsenior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 based on the non-\nimpleadment of all the legal heirs of late Sh.Ajit Singh on his demise.\n\nNon-impleadment of the legal heirs of late Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal\n(original defendant no.5):\n\n97. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2\nsubmits that, admittedly, as per the Will dated 06.02.1973 (Ex.PW-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 50 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n4/2), Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal had 1/6th share in the Suit Property.\nSh.Kamal Kishore Bindal passed away intestate on 15.12.1995.\nPlacing reliance on\nSection 8(b)\nread with\nSection 9\nread with Class II\nof the Schedule to the HSA, he states that Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal\ndid not have any Class I legal heirs, and as his half-brothers would fall\nunder Serial II of the Class II heirs, therefore, they will inheret his\nestate in precedence over the brothers and sisters of his mother, who\nare the parties in the present Suit, and who fall under Serial IX of the\nClass II heirs in the Schedule to the HSA. Relying on\nSection\n3(1)(e)(ii)\n, he submits that the half-brothers would not be related to\nSh.Kamal Kishore Bindal by uterine blood as they are not related to\neach other through a common ancestress. He submits that in spite of\nthe same, upon the death of Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal, an application,\nbeing I.A. No.2816/1996, was filed by the original plaintiff, stating\nthat as all the legal representatives of late Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal\nare on record and are already impleaded as parties to the Suit,\ntherefore, there is no necessity to bring his legal representatives on\nrecord. Based on such assertion, vide Order dated 25.07.2000, the\ndefendant no.5 was deleted from the array of parties by stating that all\nhis legal representatives are on record. The learned senior counsel for\nthe defendant nos. 1 and 2 claims that the said assertion was\ndeliberately made by the plaintiff and that the step-sons of late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur should have been impleaded as legal representatives of\nthe estate of late Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 51 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n98. Placing reliance on the Judgments in\nKenchegowda\n(supra) and\n\nHari Om Sharma\n(supra), he submits that a decree of partition in\nabsence of all coparceners/co-sharers cannot be passed.\n\n99. I have considered the submission made.\n\n100. While there cannot be any dispute with the legal proposition\nurged by the learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2,\nhowever, at the same time, based on the said submission, the Suit\ncannot be held to be not maintainable. It is not the case of the\ndefendant nos.1 and 2 that the defendant nos.1 and 2 had ever opposed\nthe application filed by the plaintiff wherein it had been claimed that\nSh.Kamal Kishore Bindal had left behind only the parties to the Suit\nas his legal heirs, and it was based on such assertion, in fact, that this\nCourt disposed of the said application vide Order dated 25.07.2000.\nThe objection has been raised for the first time only during the oral\nsubmissions of the learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and\n\n2. There is no pleading to the said effect in the written statement or\neven thereafter. There is also no issue framed in that regard.\n\n101. The Supreme Court in Dolai Maliko (supra), while observing\nthat the respondents therein had not objected to the fact that certain\nlegal representatives of the deceased had not been impleaded and that\nsuch objection was only raised at a belated stage, as is the case herein,\nhas held that the mere fact that the legal representatives of a party to\nthe Suit are not impleaded because of some over-sight or doubt itself\nwill not lead to the abatement of the Suit. I may reproduce the relevant\nparagraphs of the said Judgment herein-below:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 52 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n\"5.In the present case there is no question of\nany fraud or collusion; nor is there anything\nto show that there had not been a fair or real\ntrial, nor can it be said that against the absent\nheir there was a special case which was not\nand could not be tried in the proceeding in\nhis absence. It may also be noticed that the\nrespondents themselves did not object in the\nCourt of the Subordinate Judge that some of\nthe heirs of deceased Dolai had been left out\nand the case proceeded there as if the estate\nof Dolai deceased was represented in full by\nthe heirs brought on record. It was only in the\nHigh Court that it was discovered that Dolai\nhad left three other heirs who had not been\nbrought on the record. In the circumstances\nwe are of opinion that the estate of Dolai was\nfully represented by the heirs who had been\nbrought on the record in the Subordinate\nJudge's court and that these heirs represented\nthe absent heirs also who would be equally\nbound by the result, and there is no reason to\nhold that the appeal before the Subordinate\nJudge had abated on that ground.\n\n6. We may in this connection refer to certain\ncases where a similar view has been taken. In\nAbdul Rahman v. Shahab-ud-Din [ILR (1920)\n1 Lah 481] the appellant had died and only his\nsons were brought on the record and not his\nwidow and daughters, though the appellant\nwas a Mohammadan. It was held that as the\nheirs who had applied for being brought on\nrecord as heirs and legal representatives of\nthe deceased appellant bona fide believed that\nthey were the sole heirs and legal\nrepresentatives of the deceased, the appeal did\nnot abate notwithstanding that in\nMohammadan law other persons would be co-\nheirs of the deceased.\n\n7.\nIn\nMohd. Zafaryab Khan v. Abdul Razzaq\n[ILR\n(1928) L All 857] it was held that \"when\nby an order which has become final, a certain\nperson's name has been brought on to the\nrecord of an appeal as the legal representative\nof the deceased appellant, it is not open to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 53 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nrespondent to urge that the appeal has abated\nbecause some other heirs have been left out\".\n\n8. In Ram Charan v. Bansidhar [ILR (1942)\nAll 671] the sole appellant had died leaving\ntwo daughters. One of his daughters was\nbrought on record as his legal representative\nbut not the other. It was held that the\nsubstitution of one of the daughters as legal\nrepresentative of the deceased must be deemed\nto have been for the benefit of the entire\ninheritance which came into being on his\ndeath, and the entire estate was represented by\nher and there was no abatement of any part of\nit.\n\n9. In Babuie Shanti Devi v. Khodai Prasad\nSingh [AIR (1942) Patna 340] on the death of\nthe plaintiff in a suit to enforce a mortgage his\nsons were brought on record but not his widow\nwho had herself filed a petition stating that she\nwas not in possession of the properties of the\ndeceased plaintiff nor did she desire any\ninterest in the family properties, it was held\nthat the failure to bring the widow on the\nrecord was a mere technical defect and the\nsuit did not abate.\n\n10.\nIn\nIshwarlalLaxmichand Patel v. Kuber\nMohan Lawar\n[AIR (1943) Bom 457] on the\ndeath of the appellant, his son was brought on\nrecord as heir on his application and the\nwidow who also was an heir was left out, it\nwas held that it was proper that both the son\nand the widow should have applied for being\nbrought on the record but that the appeal did\nnot abate merely because the widow had not\napplied as the estate was fully represented by\nthe son.\n\n11. We are of opinion that these cases have\nbeen correctly decided and even where the\nplaintiff or the appellant has died and all his\nheirs have not been brought on the record\nbecause of oversight or because of some\ndoubt as to who are his heirs, the suit or the\nappeal, as the case may be, does not abate\nand the heirs brought on the record fully\nrepresent the estate unless there are\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 54 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ncircumstances like fraud or collusion to\nwhich we have already\nreferred above\n.\"\n\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n102. In the present case, there is no dispute that the step-sons of late\nSmt. Abnash Kaur were claiming a right in the Suit Property adverse\nto that of late Smt. Abnash Kaur. They had filed a Civil Suit against\nlate Smt. Abnash Kaur, which was ultimately dismissed by this Court.\nFrom the Will dated 21.07.1997 of late Sh.Ajit Singh (Ex.PW-2/1), it\nappears that the step-sons of late Smt. Abnash Kaur had, in fact, also\nstarted claiming that late Smt. Abnash Kaur was not legally wedded to\nlate Seth Shiv Prasad. Therefore, in absence of any objection from the\ndefendant nos.1 and 2 at the relevant time, and in view of the above\npeculiar facts wherein the step-sons are, in fact, claiming an interest in\nthe Suit Property which is adverse not only to the plaintiff but also to\nthe defendant nos.1 and 2 and to Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal, it cannot\nbe said that the plaintiff wanted to steal a march over the alleged legal\nheirs of Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal or on the defendant nos. 1 and 2 by\nnot impleading them in the Suit. If at all, the lapse to not implead them\nat the death of Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal appears to be genuine, bona\nfide, and not lacking any due diligence.\n\n103. In view of the above, on the death of Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal,\nhis share in the Suit Property would devolve upon his half-brothers as\nthey fall under Serial II of the Class 2 legal heirs in the Schedule of\nthe HSA. However, the Suit cannot fail due to non-impleadment of the\nhalf-brothers of Sh.Kamal Kishore Bindal as his legal heirs.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 55 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n104. At this stage, it may also be relevant to note that the defendant\nno.1 has placed on record two Agreements to Sell dated 08.04.1993\n(Ex.DW1/33 and Ex.DW1/35) purpotedly executed by late Sh.Kamal\nKishore Bindal transferring his rights in the Suit Property in favour of\ndefendant nos.1 and 2. As noted hereinabove, the learned counsel for\nthe plaintiff has submitted that not only are there no pleadings in the\nwritten statement filed by the defendant nos.1 and 2 regarding any\nsuch Agreements to Sell, but also the defendant nos.1 and 2 have not\nproved the said documents or any consideration passing to late Shri\nKamal Kishore Bindal under the same.\n\n105. This Court need not adjudicate on the above issues as no right is\nbeing claimed by the defendant no.1 or defendant no.2 in the present\nSuit based on these Agreements and they are not the subject matter of\nthe present Suit. No issue in this regard was framed or pressed by the\ndefendant no.1 and/or the defendant no.2. In fact, the learned counsel\nfor the defendant nos.1 and 2 did not make any submissions relying\nupon the said Agreements.\n\nWhether the Suit seeking partition of the Suit Property without\npraying for a decree of redemption of the mortgage is\nmaintainable?:\n\n106. As noted hereinabove, it is the case of the defendant no.1 that in\nterms of the Judgment and Compromise Decree dated 20.02.1978\n(Ex.PW-4/DX8) passed by a Division Bench of this Court in\nRFA(OS) No. 11/1971, titled Smt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v.\nSmt.

On the\nother hand, it is the case of the plaintiff that in terms of the above-\nmentioned Decree, the defendant no.1 was only given the right to\nrecover the full decretal amount from the other legal heirs of late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur and, in law, the defendant no.1 cannot claim her rights\nas a subrogatee as understood under\nSection 92\nof the TP Act.\n\n107. To appreciate the above contentions, a brief recapitulation of\nthe facts leading to the Compromise Decree dated 20.02.1978 passed\nin RFA(OS)11/1971, titled Smt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v. Smt.\nSushila Daphtary and Anr.(Ex. PW-4/DX8) by a Division Bench of\nthis Court in the above referred appeal, would need to be made.\n\n108. It is not disputed that late Smt. Abnash Kaur had created a\nmortgage in favour of the Daphtarys against a loan of Rs.1,98,000/-,\nvide Mortgage Deeds dated 19.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/42) and\n24.01.1959 (Ex.

Shrimati Abnash Kaur & Ors. (Ex. PW-4/16),\nwhereby late Smt. Abnash Kaur was directed to pay the Daphtarys a\nsum of Rs.1,98,000/- as principal amount along with interest thereon\nat the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of the mortgage till the\ndate of its realization. Late Smt. Abnash Kaur was allowed three\nmonths' time to redeem the said mortgage and in the event of default,\nthe Daphtarys were held entitled to apply to the Court for a final\nDecree for the sale of the mortgaged property, that is, the Suit\nProperty.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 57 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n109. In an appeal filed by the legal heirs of late Smt. Abnash Kaur,\nthat is, the parties herein, being RFA(OS) 11/1971, titled Smt.\nAbnash Kaur through LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and Anr, a\nDivision Bench of this Court, while confirming the Decree passed by\nthe learned Single Judge, further by a Decree dated 20.02.1978, held\nthat the same will be deemed to be satisfied, if the appellants therein,\nthat is, the legal heirs of late Smt. Abnash Kaur under the Will dated\n06.02.1973, pay a sum of Rs.3,60,000/- to the Daphtarys in\naccordance with the schedule mentioned therein. In the said Decree, it\nwas further recorded as under:-\n\n\"3. In order to avoid any possible disputes\namongst the appellants themselves, it is\nrecorded that all the other appellants will be\nbound to contribute to any sums that may be\npaid by Mrs. Adarsh Kaur Gill pursuant to this\ncompromise, and that after payment she will\nbe entitled to recover their proportionate\nshare from the other appellants.\n\n4. If the compromise is carried out, then on\npayment of the amounts hereby agreed to be\npaid, the mortgage deeds and title deeds shall\nbe returned to Mrs. Adarsh Kaur Gill, and the\nmortgaged property shall be deemed to have\nbeen redeemed by her and she will be\nsubrogated to the rights of the mortgagees,\nand shall be entitled to recover the full\ndecretal amount from the other appellants as if\nthis compromise had not been made and the\nappeal had been dismissed, with interest\naccrued due till the date of payment by them.\n\n5. Nothing in paragraphs 3 and 4 above\nshall in any manner affect the rights of\nrespondents Nos.1 and 2 under this\ncompromise, or otherwise prejudice them in\nany manner whatsoever, and the said two\nparagraphs had been inserted herein solely for\nthe purpose of the appellants.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 58 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n6. It is hereby recorded that the appellants\nother than Mrs. Adarsh Kaur Gill have also\nagreed to be bound by all the terms and\nconditions of the compromise herein\nrecorded.\"\n\n110. It is not disputed that the defendant no.1 paid the entire amount\nin terms of the above Decree to the Daphtarys, and based on the same,\na Division Bench of this Court passed an Order dated 08.05.1981 (Ex.\nDW-1/45) in the above appeal, which reads as under:-\n\n\"This application is not opposed. Mr. Chawla\nsays that the decretal amount has been paid to\nhis clients.\n\nAccordingly, satisfaction of the decree is\nrecorded.\n\nThe two mortgage deeds and the other title\ndeeds mentioned in paragraph 11(11) of this\napplication will now be delivered to the\napplicant by the Deputy Registrar on 20th\nMay 1981, on which date this matter will be\nlisted before him.\n\nThe applicant will be subrogated to the rights\nof the mortgagees in accordance with the\nterms of the compromise decree dated 20th\nFebruary 1978.\n\nThis application is disposed of accordingly.\nThere will be no order as to costs.\"\n\n111. It is on the basis of the above orders, that the defendant no.1\nclaims her rights as a subrogatee, while the plaintiff claims that she is\nonly entitled to recover the amount paid by her to the Daphtarys from\nthe other legal heirs of late Smt. Abnash Kaur in proportion to their\nshares in the Suit Property.\n\n112. At this point, I find it necessary to refer to\nSection 92\nof the TP\nAct, which defines the rights of a subrogatee of a mortgage. It reads as\nunder:-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 59 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n\"92. Subrogation.--Any of the persons\nreferred to in section 91 (other than the\nmortgagor) and any co-mortgagor shall, on\nredeeming property subject to the mortgage,\nhave, so far as regards redemption,\nforeclosure or sale of such property, the same\nrights as the mortgagee whose mortgage he\nredeems may have against the mortgagor or\nany other mortgagee.\n\nThe right conferred by this section is called the\nright of subrogation, and a person acquiring\nthe same is said to be subrogated to the rights\nof the mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems.\nA person who has advanced to a mortgagor\nmoney with which the mortgage has been\nredeemed shall be subrogated to the rights of\nthe mortgagee whose mortgage has been\nredeemed, if the mortgagor has by a registered\ninstrument agreed that such persons shall be\nso subrogated.\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to\nconfer a right of subrogation on any person\nunless the mortgage in respect of which the\nright is claimed has been redeemed in full.\"\n\n113. In Krishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair (dead) by LRs. (supra),\nthe Supreme Court, while considering an almost similar factual\nsituation, framed the question of law as under:-\n\n\"5. At the very outset, it may be stated that the\nlearned counsel for Defendant 1 submitted that\nthe parties in this case were of\nSripandarachetti Cult of Kerala, governed by\nHindu Mitakshara law and as there had been a\npartition in family before 1941, the year in\nwhich the suit for redemption was filed, it\ncannot be said that Defendant 1 while\nredeeming the property alone was acting on\nbehalf of the family or the joint family funds\nwere utilised for payment of mortgage money.\nIn our opinion, this controversy is wholly\nbesides the point. Whether there was a\npartition in the family and whether Schedule\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 60 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n„C‟ property was also partitioned is not of any\nconsequence for the present controversy\ninasmuch as we find that so far as the\nSchedule „C‟ property is concerned it was\nsubject to mortgage and the plaintiff and\nDefendant 1 both had shares therein. They\nmay be co-tenants or tenants-in-common but\nthat would not make any difference so far as\nthe status of the plaintiff and Defendant 1\nbeing co-mortgagors qua the suit property is\nconcerned. We proceed on this factual premise\nthat out of the co-mortgagors, more than one,\nand all having entitlement to a share each in\nthe suit property, one of them had redeemed\nthe property by paying the entire mortgaged\nmoney and had singularly entered into\npossession over the entire mortgaged property.\nConsequent upon redemption, it is the other\nco-owner of the property i.e. the plaintiff, who\nis now asking for the partition of the property\ncommensurate with his share. We have to see\nwhat are the rights and obligations of the\nparties qua each other and whether a suit for\npartition filed by the plaintiff was\nmaintainable. That would determine the\nquestion of limitation as well.\"\n\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n114. The Supreme Court held that such a situation would be covered\nby the first part of\nSection 92\nof the TP Act. It held as under:-\n\n\"9. A bare reading of the provision shows that\nthe first para of this section deals with\nsubrogation by operation of law. Subrogation\nby agreement is dealt with in the third para.\nThe present one is not a case of subrogation\nby agreement. The relevant provision\napplicable would, therefore, be as contained in\nfirst para of\nSection 92\n. The provision\nstatutorily incorporates the long-standing and\nsettled rule of equity which has been held to be\napplicable even in such territories where the\n\nTransfer of Property Act\ndoes not apply.\"\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 61 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n115. The Supreme Court also relied upon its earlier Judgment in\n\nGaneshi Lal v. Joti Pershad\n, (1952) 2 SCC 373, which had repelled\nthe contention of the defendant no.1 therein that a Suit for partition\nand possession was not maintainable without bringing a suit for\nredemption. The Supreme Court discussed the said Judgment in the\nfollowing words:-\n\n\"10. In the early case\nof Hodgson v. Shaw [Hodgson v. Shaw, (1834)\n3 My & K 183 : 40 ER 70] Lord Brougham\nsaid : (ER p. 73)\n\"... The rule here is undoubted, and it is\none founded on the plainest principles of\nnatural reason and justice, that the\nsurety paying off a debt shall stand in\nthe place of the creditor, and have all the\nrights which he has, for the purpose of\nobtaining his reimbursement.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\nI have italicised the word \"reimbursement\".\n\nSheldon in his well-known treatise\non Subrogation has got the following passage\nin\nSection 13\nof the 2nd Edn.:\n\n\"13. Subrogation will be made to serve\nthe purposes of Justice and the intent of\nthe parties.--There is another class of\ncases in which he who has paid money\ndue upon a mortgage of land to which he\nhad some title which might be affected or\ndefeated by the mortgage, and who was\nthus entitled to redeem, has the right to\nconsider the mortgage as subsisting in\nhimself, and to hold the land as if it\nsubsisted, until others interested in the\nredemption, or who held also the right to\nredeem, have paid a contribution.\"\n\nBe it noted that what is spoken of here is a\ncontribution.\n\n11. Dealing with the subject of subrogation of\na surety by payment of a promissory note and\nciting the observations of the Alabama Court,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 62 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nHarris says in his work on Subrogation (1889\nEdn.) at p. 125:\n\n\"The rule is, that a surety paying a debt,\nshall stand in the place of the creditor;\nand is entitled to the benefit of all the\nsecurities which the creditor had for the\npayment of the debt, from the principal\ndebtors; in a word, he is subrogated to\nall the rights of the creditor; the surety,\nhowever, cannot avail himself of the\ninstrument on which he is surety, by its\npayment. By payment it is discharged\nand ceases to exist, and the payment will\nnot, even in equity, be considered an\nassignment; the surety merely becomes\nthe creditor of the principal to the\namount paid for him.\"\n\n12. To compel the co-debtors or co-\n\nmortgagors to pay more than their share of\nwhat was paid to the creditor or mortgagee\nwould be to perpetrate an inequity or injustice,\nas it would mean that the debtor who is in a\nposition to pay and pays up can obtain an\nadvantage for himself over the other joint\ndebtors. Such a result will not be\ncountenanced by equity; the favouritism shown\nby law to a surety, high as it is, does not\nextend so far. The surety can ask to be\nindemnified for his loss : he can invoke the\ndoctrine of subrogation as an aid to his right\nof contribution. Sheldon says in\nSection 105\nof\nhis book:\n\n\"The subrogation of a surety will not be\ncarried further than is necessary for his\nindemnity; if he buys up the security at a\ndiscount, or makes his payment in a\ndepreciated currency, he can enforce it\nonly for what it cost him. He cannot\nspeculate at the expense of his principal;\nhis only right is to be repaid.\"\n\n116. The Supreme Court also distinguished its earlier Judgment in\n\nValliamma Champaka Pillai v. Sivathanu Pillai and Others\n, (1979)\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 63 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n4 SCC 429, which had dismissed an appeal filed by the plaintiff\ntherein against a Judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court of\nMadras, which had held that a non-redeeming co-mortgagor has two\nperiods of limitation within which he may file his suit against the\nredeeming co-mortgagor for redemption of his share, namely, within\n50 years provided for by the Travancore Limitation Act, starting from\nthe date of the mortgage, or, if that period has already expired, then\nwithin 12 years from the date of redemption by the redeeming co-\nmortgagor, under\nArticle 132\nof the Travancore Limitation Act. The\nSupreme Court in Krishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair (dead) by LRs.\n\n(supra) held that the elevation of the status of the redeeming co-\nmortgagor to that of the original mortgagee, although there was no\nassignment of the mortgaged debt in his favour, was beyond the law\nenunciated by the Supreme Court in\nGaneshi Lal\n(supra). The Court\nobserved as under:-\n\n\"15. Whatever the difference might be\nbetween the English law and the Indian law as\nregards the right to enforce decrees and\nsecurities for the due payment of a debt in the\ncase of a surety who discharges a simple\nmoney debt and a surety who pays up a\nmortgage, it is still noteworthy that Section V\nof the Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856\n(England) provided for indemnification by the\nprincipal debtor for the advances made and\nloss sustained by the surety.\n\n16. There is a distinction in this respect\nbetween a third party who claims subrogation\nand a co-mortgagor who claims the right, and\nthis is brought out by Sir Rashbehary Ghose in\nhis Law of Mortgage in India, Vol. I, 5th Edn.\nHe says at p. 354, pointingout that co-\nmortgagors stand in a fiduciary relation:\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 64 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n\"I should add that an assignee of a\nmortgage is entitled, as a rule, to\nrecover whatever may be due on the\nsecurity. But if he stands in a fiduciary\nrelation, he can only claim the price\nwhich he has actually paid together with\nincidental expenses.\"\n\n117. The Court also approved its earlier Judgment in\nVariavan\nSaraswathi & Anr. v. Eachampi Thevi & Ors.\n, 1993 Supp (2) SCC\n201, by observing as under:-\n\n\"17.\nIn\nVariavan Saraswathi\ncase [1993 Supp\n(2) SCC 201] the law has been set out with\nprecision and clarity and both the earlier\ndecisions dealt with hereinabove have been\nreferred to. Their Lordships (vide para 6) have\ndealt with the contrast between two situations:\n\n(i) where a mortgagee assigns his interest in\nfavour of another person (i.e. a stranger); and,\n\n(ii) where a co-mortgagor or any one on\nbehalf of the mortgagor and authorised under\nlaw pays the amount and brings to an end the\ninterest which the mortgagee had. It has been\nheld that in the first case the assignee becomes\nholder of the same interest which the\nmortgagee had i.e. he steps into the shoes of\nthe mortgagee. In the latter case, once the\nmortgage debt is discharged by a person\nbeneficially interested in the equity of\nredemption, the mortgage comes to an end by\noperation of law. Consequently, the\nrelationship of mortgagor and mortgagee\ncannot subsist. A person paying off a debt to\nsecure the property either with the consent of\nothers or on his own volition becomes, in law,\nthe owner entitled to hold and possess the\nproperty. But in equity the right is to hold the\nproperty till he is reimbursed. Such right in\nequity either in favour of the person who\ndischarges the debt or the person whose debt\nhas been discharged, does not result in\nresumption of relationship of mortgagor and\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 65 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nmortgagee.\n\n18. Dealing with\nSection 92\nof the Transfer of\nProperty Act it has been held in\nVariavan\nSaraswathi\ncase [1993 Supp (2) SCC 201] that\nthe rights created in favour of a redeeming co-\nmortgagor as a result of discharge of debt are\n\"so far as regards redemption, foreclosure or\nsale of such property, the same rights as the\nmortgagee whose mortgage he redeems\".\n\nPosing a question -- does a person who, in\nequity, gets subrogated become a mortgagee?\n\nTheir Lordships have held: (SCC p. 207, para\n\n7)\n\"A plain reading of the section does not\nwarrant a construction that the\nsubstitutee becomes a mortgagee. The\nexpression is, „right(s) as the mortgagee‟\nand not right(s) of mortgagee. The\nlegislative purpose was statutory\nrecognition of the equitable right to hold\nthe property till the co-mortgagor was\nreimbursed. And not to create\nrelationship of mortgagor and\nmortgagee. The section confers certain\nrights on co-mortgagor and provides for\nthe manner of its exercise as well. The\nrights are of redemption, foreclosure\nand sale. And the manner of exercise is\nas mortgagee. The word „as‟, according\nto Black's Law Dictionary, means „in the\nmanner prescribed‟. Thus a co-\n\nmortgagor in possession, of excess share\nredeemed by him, can enforce his claim\nagainst non-redeeming mortgagor by\nexercising rights of foreclosure or sale\nas is exercised by mortgagee under\n\nSection 67\nof the Transfer of Property\nAct. But that does not make him\nmortgagee.\"\n\nIt was further observed that the abovesaid\nlegal position does not alter either because\nduring partition the equity of redemption in\nrespect of property redeemed was transferred\nor because in the plaint it was claimed that\nmortgage subsisted.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 66 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n19.\nIn our opinion, the law as stated\nin\nVariavan Saraswathi\ncase [1993 Supp (2)\nSCC 201] where\nSection 92\nof the Transfer of\nProperty Act has been specifically dealt with\nand which, as admitted at the Bar, applies to\nthe mortgage in question, clinches the issue\narising for decision in the present case.\"\n\n118. The Supreme Court has held that the doctrine of subrogation is\nbased on the doctrine of equity and the principles of natural justice\nand not on the doctrine of privity of contract. One of such principles\nof equity is that a person paying money on someone else's behalf,\nwhich another is bound by law to pay, is entitled to be reimbursed by\nthe other. The Court has further held that a case, similar to the one in\nthe present, would be governed by the first paragraph of\nSection 92\nof\nthe TP Act, which recognizes the same equity of reimbursement as is\nprovided under\nSection 69\nof the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\n\n119. The Supreme Court held that\nSection 92\nof the TP Act does not\nhave the effect of the substitutee becoming a mortgagee. It only\nconfers certain rights on the redeeming co-mortgagors and also\nprovides for certain remedies like the remedy of redemption,\nforeclosure and sale being available to the substitutee just as they were\navailable to the person substituted, that is, the mortgagee. These\nrights, which the subrogatee exercises are, therefore, not as a\nmortgagee, but are akin to those vested in a mortgagor. Therefore, one\nof the co-mortgagors, by redeeming the mortgage in its entirety,\ncannot claim a right higher than what he otherwise had, nor can he\ndefeat a legal claim for partition. The right created in his favour is the\nright to claim contribution from the other co-mortgagors. He can resist\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 67 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nthe claim of the non-redeeming co-mortgagors to the partition of the\nproperty by pleading his right of contribution and by not parting with\nthe property unless the non-redeeming co-mortgagor discharges his\nduty to make the contribution. However, this would not make the Suit\nseeking partition of property as one seeking redemption. I may quote\nfrom the Judgmentin as under:-\n\n\"21. The present one is a case of subrogation\nby the operation of law and hence governed by\nthe first para of\nSection 92\nof the Transfer of\nProperty Act. The provision recognises the\nsame equity of reimbursement as underlies\n\nSection 69\nof the Indian Contract Act that \"a\nperson who is interested in the payment of\nmoney which another is bound by law to pay,\nand who therefore pays it is entitled to be\nreimbursed by the other\". Such a payment\nmade, carries with it, at times, an equitable\ncharge.\nSection 92\nof the Transfer of Property\nAct does not have the effect of a substitutee\nbecoming a mortgagee. The provision confers\ncertain rights on the redeeming co-mortgagor\nand also provides for the remedy of\nredemption; foreclosure and sale being\navailable to the substitutee as they were\navailable to the person substituted. These\nrights the subrogee exercises not as a\nmortgagee reincarnate but by way of rights\nakin to those vesting in the mortgagee. The co-\nmortgagor can be a co-owner too. A property\nsubject to mortgage is available, as between\nco-mortgagors, for partition, of course, subject\nto adjustment for the burden on the property.\nOne of the co-mortgagors, by redeeming the\nmortgage in its entirety, cannot claim a right\nhigher than what he otherwise had, faced with\na claim for partition by the other co-owner. He\ncannot defeat the legal claim for partition\nthough he can insist on the exercise of such\nlegal right claimed by the other co-owner-\ncum-co-mortgagor being made subject to the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 68 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nexercise of the equitable right to claim\ncontribution vesting in him by subrogation.\n\n22. In our opinion, the suit filed in the present\ncase being a suit for partition primarily and\npredominantly and the relief of redemption\nhaving been sought for only pursuant to the\ndirection made by the High Court in its order\nof remand, the limitation for the suit would be\ngoverned by\nArticle 120\nof the Limitation Act,\n1908. For a suit for partition the starting point\nof limitation is -- when the right to sue\naccrues, that is, when the plaintiff has notice\nof his entitlement to partition being denied. In\nsuch a suit, the right of the redeeming co-\nmortgagor would be to resist the claim of non-\nredeeming co-mortgagor by pleading his right\nof contribution and not to part with the\nproperty unless the non-redeeming co-\nmortgagor had discharged his duty to make\ncontribution. This equitable defence taken by\nthe redeeming co-mortgagor in the written\nstatement would not convert the suit into a suit\nfor redemption filed by the non-redeeming co-\nmortgagor.\"\n\n120. The Court also clarified that it would make no difference in the\nabove position of law where such co-mortgagors are joint tenants or\ntenants-in-common. While clarifying the same, the Supreme Court has\nheld as under:-\n\n\"25. It was also submitted by the learned\ncounsel for the respondent that it would make\na difference if the family to which the parties\nbelong was joint at the time of mortgage and\nat the time of redemption. The learned counsel\nsubmitted that on account of partition in the\nfamily the parties had ceased to be co-tenants\nand were tenants-in-common qua each other\nand therefore the redemption by the\nrespondent was not and cannot be deemed to\nbe on behalf of the family. In our opinion, it is\nnot necessary to deal with this submission at\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 69 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nall. Whether joint-tenants or tenants-in-\ncommon, the fact remains that the status of the\nplaintiff and defendant was that of co-\nmortgagors, one being a non-redeeming co-\nmortgagor and the other being a redeeming\nco-mortgagor. The law would remain the same\nand its applicability would not change whether\nthe parties are treated as co-tenants or\ntenants-in-common.\"\n\n121. Applying the above principles to the facts of the present case,\nthe Compromise Decree dated 20.02.1978 passed in\nRFA(OS)11/1971, titled Smt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v.

The order dated\n08.05.1981(Ex.

(supra), therefore, the only\nright vested in the defendant no.1 is to claim a contribution of the\namount paid by her, along with interest, from the other legal heirs of\nlate Smt. Abnash Kaur, and to resist a claim for partition and\npossession of the property made by the other co-owners unless such\namount is first paid by the other legal heirs to the defendant no.1. The\nother legal heirs, however, do not have to specifically pray for\nredemption of the mortgage.\n\nClaim of the plaintiff that the mortgage was redeemed from the\nestate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur:\n\n123. The learned counsel for the plaintiff, as recorded in the Order\ndated 09.05.2023, has restricted prayer (f) of the Suit by claiming that\nthe mortgage had been redeemed by the defendant no.1 from the rental\nincome received by the defendant no.1 from the Suit Property after the\ndeath of Smt. Abnash Kaur in 1976 and till the date of redemption of\nthe mortgage in May, 1981, and not from any other part of the estate\nof late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\n124. I must herein itself note that the original plaint had claimed that\nthe mortgage had been redeemed by the defendant no.1 in her name\nfrom the estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, based on legal advice.

The learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff further submits that the rent between the\nperiod of 1978 and 1979 was Rs.6,000/- per month; and between the\nperiod of January, 1980 till May, 1981 was Rs.12,500/- per month.\n\n125. I do not find any merit in the above contention of the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff.\n\n126. The settlement agreement as recorded in the Decree dated\n20.02.1978 passed in RFA(OS)11/1971, titled Smt. Abnash Kaur\nthrough LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and Anr.(Ex. PW-4/DX8) by\nthe Division Bench of this Court, and the Order dated 08.05.1981\npassed by the Division Bench of this Court (Ex. DW-1/45), all clearly\nrecord that the defendant no.1 is the person who had redeemed the\nmortgage, and that she would be entitled to claim the amount paid by\nher for the redemption of the mortgage from the other co-sharers. This\nitself belies the claim of the plaintiff that the mortgage had been\nredeemed by the defendant no.1 from the estate of late Smt. Abnash\nKaur. There is no challenge to the decree or the order passed in the\nabove appeal, before this Court.\n\n127. Even otherwise, in terms of the Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958\nexecuted between late Smt. Abnash Kaur and the defendant no.1, the\ndefendant no.1 was entitled to sub-lease the property. The rent\nreceived from such sub-lease, therefore, cannot be said to be the estate\nof late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 72 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n128. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 has\nalso drawn my attention to the averment made in the original plaint\nitself wherein it has been claimed as under:\n\n\"32. The plaintiff submits that the last leave\nand licence agreement was executed by him\n(he being the General Attorney of Defendant\nNo.1) on the instructions of Smt. Abnash Kaur\nwith the G.D.R.Embassy in November, 1974\nfor the period from 1.1.1975 to 31.12.1979 at\nRs.11,000/- per month. G.D.R. Embassy made\nthe full payment of the said five years in\nadvance in the name of defendant No.1 to the\nplaintiff, that is Rs.6,60,000/- (Rs.3,60,000/- by\ncheque of their BankersUnited commercial\nBank, Parliament Street, New Delhi, in favouir\nof the plaintiff, and Rs.3,00,000/- in cash\nagainst receipt), as desired by Smt. Abnash\nKaur. The said amount of Rs.6,60,000/- was\npaid by the plaintiff to Smt. Abnash Kaur. The\nplaintiff submits that even while filing the\nincome tax returns for the assessment year\n1975-76 in the name of the defendant No.1,\nSmt. Abnash Kaur had shown only Rs.5,000/-\nper month instead of Rs. 11,000/- per month,\nfor the months of January, February and\nMarch, 1975.\"\n\n129. It was the own case of the plaintiff that the rent for the period\ntill 31.12.1979 had been paid by the G.D.R. Embassy in advance to\nthe plaintiff/late Smt. Abnash Kaur. The said money was, therefore,\nnot in the hands of the defendant no.1 for her to redeem the mortgage.\nThe plaintiff is clearly building a new case in the course of his\nsubmissions and the same is liable to be rejected.\n\n130. In view of the above, I find no merit in the claim of the plaintiff\nthat the mortgage over the Suit Property was redeemed by the\ndefendant no.1 from the estate of late Smt. Abnash Kaur.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 73 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nSubmission of the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the plaintiff\nis deemed to have contributed his share of the redemption amount to\ndefendant no.1 from the rent received by defendant no.1:\n\n131. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that the\ndefendant no.1, admittedly, has received a rent of Rs.6,000/- per\nmonth from 20.02.1978 (date of redemption of mortgage) to\n31.12.1979, and thereafter, Rs.12,500/- per month from January 1980\nto March 1985, and Rs.17,500/- per month from January 1986 to\nDecember 1990 from the G.D.R. Embassy. He submits that, therefore,\nthe defendant no.1 has received a total of Rs.17,35,500/- as rent for\nthe above period. He submits that as against this, the plaintiff, in terms\nof the Decree dated 20.02.1978 passed in RFA(OS)11/1971, titled\nSmt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and\nAnr.(Ex. PW-4/DX8) by the Division Bench of this Court, is liable to\ncontribute 61.11% as his share in the redemption amount, which\nwould be Rs.10,58,685/-. He submits that, therefore, the plaintiff is\ndeemed to have paid his share of the redemption amount to defendant\nno.1.\n\n132. I do not find any merit in the above contention of the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff.\n\n133. Apart from the fact that it was the own case of the plaintiff that\nthe rent from G.D.R. Embassy for the period 01.01.1975 to\n31.12.1979 had been received in advance by the plaintiff and was\ngiven to late Smt. Abnash Kaur, even otherwise, not only under the\nLease Deed but also as a subrogate mortgagee, it has not been shown\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 74 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nby the plaintiff how the plaintiff can claim any right in the rent being\nreceived by the defendant no.1.\n\n134. In the Decree dated 20.02.1978 passed in RFA(OS)11/1971,\ntitled Smt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and\nAnr.(Ex. PW-4/DX8) by the Division Bench of this Court, it has not\nbeen provided that any rent or income received by the defendant no.1\nas a subrogatee mortgagee of the Suit Property would have to be\nadjusted against her claim for payment of the principal amount or the\ninterest of the redemption amount. In the absence of any such\nstipulation, the plaintiff cannot claim that any rent received by the\ndefendant no.1 post the redemption of the mortgage would ensure to\nthe benefit of the plaintiff or the other co-sharer.\n\nPeriod of limitation for filing of the Suit:\n\n135. The learned senior counsel for defendant nos.1 and 2, based on\nthe plea that the defendant no.1 had been subrogated to the right of the\nmortgagee/Daphtarys, and as the Suit does not pray for the redemption\nof mortgage, contended that the Suit would now be barred under\n\nArticle 61\nof the\nLimitation Act\n.\n\n136. I do not find any merit in this submission.\n\n137. As held in Krishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair (dead) by LRs,\nthe plaintiff is not to sue for redemption of the mortgage and a suit for\npartition would be maintainable, though the defendant no.1 would be\nentitled to resist the claim of partition unless the plaintiff contributes\nhis share of money paid for the redemption of the mortgage by\ndefendant no.1 and the incidental expenses thereto.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 75 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n138. As far as the Suit for partition is concerned, it would be\ngoverned by\nArticle 65\nof the\nLimitation Act\n.\n\n139.\nIn Devi alias Vidya Vati (dead) by\nLRs\n(supra), the Supreme\nCourt has reiterated that the legislature has not prescribed any period\nof limitation for filing a Suit for partition because partition is an\nincident attached to the property and there is always a running cause\nof action for seeking partition by one of the co-sharers. Where the\nproperty is joint, co-sharers are the representatives of each other, and a\nco-sharer who is in possession of the joint property shall be deemed to\nbe in possession on behalf of all the co-sharers. It is only if the co-\nsharer or joint owner in possession of the property, professes a hostile\ntitle as against the other co-sharers openly and to the knowledge of the\nother co-owners, that he can be provided the hostile title where the\npossession has continued uninterruptedly for the whole period\nprescribed for recovery of possession, that is, 12 years. I may quote\nfrom the Judgment as under:\n\n\"20. The legislature has not prescribed any\nperiod of limitation for filing a suit for\npartition because partition is an incident\nattached to the property and there is always a\nrunning cause of action for seeking partition\nby one of the co-sharers if and when he\ndecides not to keep his share joint with other\nto co-sharers. Since the filing of the suit is\nwholly dependent upon the will of the co-\nsharer, the period of limitation, specially the\ndate or time from which such period would\ncommence, could not have been possibly\nprovided for by the legislature and, therefore,\nin this Act also a period of limitation, so far as\nsuits for partition are concerned, has not been\nprescribed. This, however does not mean that\na co-sharer who is arrayed as a defendant in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 76 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nthe suit cannot raise the plea of adverse\npossession against the co-sharer who has\ncome before the court as a plaintiff seeking\npartition of his share in the joint property.\n\n21. Normally, where the property is joint, co-\nsharers are the representatives of each other.\nThe co-sharer who might be in possession of\nthe joint property shall be deemed to be in\npossession on behalf of all the co-sharers. As\nsuch, it would be difficult to raise the plea of\nadverse possession by one co-sharer against\nthe other. But if the co-sharer or the joint\nowner had been professing hostile title as\nagainst other co-sharers openly and to the\nknowledge of other joint owners, he can,\nprovided the hostile title or possession has\ncontinued uninterruptedly for the whole period\nprescribed for recovery of possession,\nlegitimately acquire title by adverse\npossession and can plead such title in defence\nto the claim for partition.\"\n\n140. A learned Single Judge of this Court, has explained the above\nconcept for its relevance to the period of limitation, in\nAshok Kumar\nv. Mohd. Rustam& Anr.\n, 2016 SCC OnLine Del 466, by observing as\nunder:\n\n\"16.\nArticle 58\nof the\nSchedule to the\nLimitation Act\n, for the relief of declaration,\nundoubtedly provides limitation of three years\nfrom the date when the cause of action\naccrues. However I am of the opinion that\nonce the plaintiff, besides suing for\ndeclaration of title also sues for recovery of\npossession of immovable property on the basis\nof title, the limitation for such a suit would be\ngoverned by the limitation provided for the\nrelief of possession and not by limitation\nprovided for the relief of declaration. To hold\notherwise would tantamount to providing two\ndifferent periods of limitation for a suit for\nrecovery of possession of immovable property\nbased on title i.e. of three years if the suit\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 77 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nbesides for the said relief is also for the relief\nof declaration of title and of twelve years as\naforesaid if no relief of declaration is claimed.\nA relief of declaration of title to immovable\nproperty is implicit in a suit for recovery of\npossession of immovable property based on\ntitle inasmuch as without establishing title to\nproperty, if disputed, no decree for the relief of\npossession also can be passed. Thus, merely\nbecause a plaintiff in such a suit also\nspecifically claims the relief of declaration of\ntitle, cannot be a ground to treat him\ndifferently and reduce the period of limitation\navailable to him from that provided of twelve\nyears, to three years. Supreme Court in\n\nAnathula Sudhakar v. P. Buchi Reddy\n(2008) 4\nSCC 594 held (i) where a cloud is raised over\nplaintiff's title and he does not have\npossession, a suit for declaration and\npossession is the remedy; (ii) where the\nplaintiff's title is not in dispute or under a\ncloud, but he is out of possession, he has to sue\nfor possession; (iii) a cloud is said to arise\nover a person's title, when some apparent\ndefect in his title to a property, or when some\nprima facie right of a third party over it, is\nmade out or shown.\n\n17. I am supported in my aforesaid view by:\n\nA. GhanshyamdasVallabhadasGujrathi\nv. BrijramanRasiklal where a Division\nBench of the High Court of Bombay\nnegatived the contention as found favour\nwith the learned Additional District\nJudge in the impugned order and held\nthat the main relief being of possession,\nand declaration being an ancillary\nrelief, the proper Article of the\nLimitation Act would be\nArticle 65\nand\nnot\nArticle 58\nof the First Schedule;\n\nB. State of Maharashtra v. Pravin\nJethalalKamdar\n(2000) 3 SCC 460\nwhere it was held that the factum of the\nplaintiff besides the relief of possession\nhaving sought declaration also is of no\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 78 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nconsequence and in such a case the\ngoverning article of the\nSchedule to the\nLimitation Act\nis\nArticle 65;\n\nC. MechineniChokka Rao v.\n\nSattuSattamma where the High Court of\nAndhra Pradesh reiterated that to a suit\nbased on title but claiming declaration\nof title to the suit property with\nconsequential relief of possession,\n\nArticle 65\nwould apply and\nArticle 58\n\nwould have no application;\nArticle 58\n\napplies only to a case where declaration\nsimpliciter is sought i.e. without any\nfurther relief; the 89th Report of the Law\nCommission recommending for\namendment of\nArticle 58\nby adding the\nwords \"without seeking further relief\"\n\nafter the word \"declaration\" in the first\ncolumn of\nArticle 58\n, so as to avoid any\nconfusion was also noticed;\n\nD.

Seetharaman v. Jayaraman\n(2014) 2\nMWN (Civil) 643 where also it was held\nthat a title over immovable property\ncannot extinguish unless the defendant\nremains in adverse possession thereof\nfor a continuous period of 12 years or\nmore and therefore\nArticle 65\nof the\n\nSchedule to the Limitation Act\napplies to\na suit for declaration of title and for\nrecovery of possession of immovable\nproperty.\"\n\n141. Applying the above principles to the facts of the present case, it\nis the own case of the defendant no.1 that in terms of the Decree dated\n20.02.1978 passed in RFA(OS)11/1971, titled Smt. Abnash Kaur\nthrough LRs. v. Smt. Sushila Daphtary and Anr.(Ex. PW-4/DX8) by\nthe Division Bench of this Court, the right of the plaintiff as a co-\nsharer in the Suit Property had been recognised. It had also been\nprovided that all the other co-sharers, including the plaintiff, shall be\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 80 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nbound to contribute to the sums paid by the defendant no.1 for\nredemption of the mortgage. She would, therefore, be entitled to seek\nprotection of her possession till the time the other co-sharers\ncontribute their shares in the redemption amount paid by her. Her\npossession over the suit property would, therefore, not be adverse to\nthat of the plaintiff but would be permissive, as has been held by the\nSupreme Court in Krishna Pillai Rajasekharan Nair (dead) by LRs.\n(supra).\n\n142. It is also important to note here that the defendant no.1 is also\nclaiming her possession as a lessee of the property. Though, the\nplaintiff denies such lease and claims that the lease was a sham\ndocument, at the same time, where the defendant no.1 herself claims\nher right to the possession of the Suit Property as a lessee, she cannot,\nat the same time, claim adverse possession over the Suit Property. The\ntwo pleas would be contradictory to each other and cannot stand\ntogether. Reliance in this regard is placed on the Judgment of Supreme\nCourt in\nMohan Lal & Ors. v. Mirza Abdul Gaffar & Anr.\n, (1996) 1\nSCC 639, wherein the Supreme Court, while delving into the question\nof mutually destructive pleas, held as under:\n\n\"3. The only question is whether the appellant\nis entitled to retain possession of the suit\nproperty. Two pleas have been raised by the\nappellant in defence. One is that having\nremained in possession from 8-3-1956, he has\nperfected his title by prescription. Secondly, he\npleaded that he is entitled to retain his\npossession by operation of\nSection 53-A\nof the\nTransfer of Property Act, 1882 (for short „the\nAct‟).\n\n4. As regards the first plea, it is inconsistent\nwith the second plea. Having come into\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 81 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\npossession under the agreement, he must\ndisclaim his right thereunder and plead and\nprove assertion of his independent hostile\nadverse possession to the knowledge of the\ntransferor or his successor in title or interest\nand that the latter had acquiesced to his\nillegal possession during the entire period of\n12 years, i.e., up to completing the period of\nhis title by prescription nec vi, nec clam, nec\nprecario. Since the appellant's claim is\nfounded on\nSection 53-A\n, it goes without\nsaying that he admits by implication that he\ncame into possession of the land lawfully\nunder the agreement and continued to remain\nin possession till date of the suit. Thereby the\nplea of adverse possession is not available to\nthe appellant.\"\n\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n143. In view of the above, I do not find any merit in the plea raised\nby the learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 that the\npresent suit would be barred by limitation as far as the prayer for\npartition is concerned.\n\nWhether the Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958 is a sham transaction:\n\n144. As is noted hereinabove, it is the case of the plaintiff that the\nLease Deed dated 18.11.1958 is a sham transaction and was entered\ninto by late Smt. Abnash Kaur with the defendant no.1 only for the\npurposes of saving the Suit Property from the claims of her step-sons,\nand also from the attachment pursuant to the orders passed by the\nIncome Tax Authorities. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has\nsubmitted that the alleged Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958 has not been\nfiled, leave alone, proved on record of the Suit. He has stated that the\ndefendant no.1 was a minor as on the date of the said lease. He has\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 82 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nalso placed reliance on the Agreement to Sell dated 02.10.1963\nexecuted between late Smt. Abnash Kaur and Sh.Jaswant Rai\n(Ex.PW4/11), contending that there was no mention of any lease in\nthe said document and it acknowledges that the possession of the Suit\nProperty was with late Smt. Abnash Kaur. He also places reliance on a\nCertificate dated 27.09.1963 (Ex.PW4/10) executed by the defendant\nno.1, wherein the defendant no.1 has acknowledged that the lease had\nbeen entered into only to show her charge on the Suit Property so as to\nsave it from the claims of the step-sons of late Smt. Abnash Kaur and\nthe Income Tax Department. He states that in the said document, the\ndefendant no.1 has also acknowledged that late Smt. Abnash Kaur has\nfull right as an owner to sell the Suit Property or give it on rent.\n\n145. I, however, find no merit in the said claim of the plaintiff.\n\n146. In the present Suit, the plaintiff claims his share in the Suit\nProperty under the Will dated 06.02.1973 (Ex. PW-4/2) of late Smt.\nAbnash Kaur. The said Will itself acknowledges the said Lease Deed\nexecuted in favour of the defendant no.1. Since the plaintiff has filed\nthe present Suit relying on the Will of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, he\ncannot disown the said document in parts. Once the testator, through\nwhom the plaintiff derives his title, has herself acknowledged the\nexistence of the said Lease in favour of the defendant no.1, it is not for\nthe plaintiff to deny the same.\n\n147. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 has\nalso relied upon various documents wherein not only late Smt.

Adarsh\nKaur Gill-defendant No. 11 in CS No. 207 of 1967-\n'Nirmal Kumar & Others v. Smt. Abnash Kaur'\nPW3/2 Assessment Order dated 28.02.1970 for Smt. Adarsh\n(Colly) Kaur Gill for the year 1959-1960 470-485\nVide Agreement dated 18.11.1958 3, South End Road,\nwas leased out to Smt. Adarsh Kaur Gill\n\n148. The learned senior counsel for the defendant nos.1 and 2 has\nalso relied upon the cross-examination of the present plaintiff-\nSh.Gurnir Singh Gill. The relevant extracts of which are as under:\n\n\"Q What do you mean by the word „fake lease\ndeed‟ as mentioned in your affidavit?\nA I say that the lease deed is fake as firstly it\nwas not made in the year 1958, it was made in\nthe year 1961. Secondly, it is not properly\nstamped and registered. I also say that this\nlease deed is fake as its original is not in\nexistence. Again said, original has been\ndestroyed.\n\nMy statement that the lease deed is fake is not\nbased on my personal knowledge rather it is\nbased on the information received by me from\nSh. Ajit Singh. Sh. Ajit Singh told me about this\nbefore filing of the present suit, i.e. somewhere\nin the year 1987 or in 1988 or may be in the\nyear 1989. I have not filed any proceedings in\nany court of law thereby challenging that the\nsaid lease deed dated 15/11/1958, is a fake\nlease deed.\n\nIt is correct that from the year 1973 when I\ncame to know with respect to contents of Will\nof Smt. Abnash Kaur, upto year 1987/1988 or\n1989 when Ajit Singh told me that this lease\ndeed is fake, I had been treating the lease deed\nas genuine one.\n\nAt this stage witness states that the fact that\nlease deed is a fake lease deed was told to him\nby Ajit Singh in the year 1983.\n\nCourt ObservationDemeanour of the witness\nis observed in his\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 87 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\ntestimony where he is\ngiving contradictory\nreplies. Law shall take its\nown course.\n\nWitness is warned to reply\nafter having understood the\nquestion properly.\n\nThe fact that the fake lease deed had been\nprepared for protecting the suit property and\nits rental income from the hands of step sons\nof Smt. Abnash Kaur, was told to me by Sh.\nAjit Singh after the death of Smt. Abnash Kaur\nwho died in the year 1976. From the word\n'after' I mean that this fact was told to me\neither in the year 1976 itself or in the year\n1977.\n\n*******\nQ I put it to you that Mr. Ajit Singh did not\ntake stand qua Ms. Adarsh Kaur Gill in the\nEviction Petition No. 367/1986 that the lease\ndeed in favour of Ms. Adarsh Kaur Gill by Ms.\nAbnash Kaur was a fake lease deed.\nA The eviction petition has been filed by me\nand my mother. I do not remember what stand\nhad been taken by Mr. Ajit Singh in the said\neviction petition qua Ms. Adarsh Kaur Gill\nand I will be able to answer this question, if I\nam shown a copy of the record of the eviction\npetition.\n\nQ Please see copy of memorandum of appeal\nin SAO No. 55/1988 titled Shri Gurnir Singh\nGill Vs. Embassy of German Democratic\nRepublic &Ors. In your cross examination\ndated 06.02.2016 you stated that you did not\nfile appeal against the order of dismissal\npassed by the court of learned ARC in your\neviction petition. Was the SAO filed without\nyour instructions?\n\nA I did not remember about the appeal when I\nanswered the question on 06.02.2016. After\nseeing the document, I say that the appeal\nmight have been filed. To answer these\nquestions, I need to see the entire record of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 88 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nproceedings emanating; from the eviction\npetition filed by me before the court of learned\nARC. Due to lapse of time, I do not remember\nall facts related to those proceedings.\"\n\n149. I, therefore, find no merit in the submission of the learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff that the Lease Deed dated 18.11.1958\nexecuted by late Smt. Abnash Kaur in favour of the defendant no.1\nwas a sham document and that the defendant no.1 cannot be said to be\nthe lessee in the Suit Property.\n\nPlaintiff's claim of termination of the lease:\n\n150. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that even\nassuming that the lease in favour of the defendant no.1 was valid, the\nsame now stands terminated. He submits that admittedly, the rent\nreceived by the defendant no.1 from the G.D.R. Embassy was more\nthan Rs.3,500/- per month. He submits that in terms of\nSection 3(1)(c)\n\nof the DRC Act, where the rent received from the sub-lessee is more\nthan Rs.3,500/-, the lease could no longer be protected under the\nDRC\nAct\n. He has further submitted that the defendant no.1, having set up a\nclaim of title to the Suit Property, in terms of\nSection 111(g)\nof the TP\nAct, is liable to be evicted and the lease comes to an end. He further\nsubmits that the defendant no.1 has also claimed ownership right over\nthe Suit Property and, therefore, the lease would come to an end as the\ndefendant no.1 cannot approbate and reprobate.\n\n151. On the other hand, the learned senior counsel for the defendant\nnos.1 and 2 has submitted that the present Suit is premised on the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 89 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nbasis that the Lease Deed in favour of defendant no.1 is a sham. He\nsubmits that the plaintiff cannot set up a new case in the course of oral\narguments and relief cannot be granted on such new case being set up\nby the plaintiff.\n\n152. I find merit in the objection of the learned senior counsel for\ndefendant nos.1 and 2. A bare reading of the plaint would show that\nthe entire basis of claim of the plaintiff in the present suit is that the\nLease Deed dated 18.11.1958 executed by late Smt. Abnash Kaur in\nfavour of the defendant no.1 was sham and, therefore, the defendant\nno.1 is not entitled to retain the possession of the Suit Property. It is\nonly in the course of oral submissions that the plaintiff has now\nchanged his stand and, in the alternate, has submitted that in case this\nCourt finds the said Lease to be a genuine transaction, the defendant\nno.1 is, even otherwise, liable to be evicted from the Suit Property. In\nthe absence of any pleadings to this effect, however, and based only\non the oral submissions of the learned counsel for the plaintiff, the\nnature of the Suit cannot be allowed to be changed.\nIn fact, for some\nother submissions, the learned counsel for the plaintiff has himself\nrelied upon the Judgment of the Supreme Court in\nBachhhaj Nahar v.\nNilima Mandal and Anr.\n, (2008) 17 SCC 491, wherein the Supreme\nCourt has cautioned and held as under:-\n\n\"23. It is fundamental that in a civil suit,\nrelief to be granted can be only with reference\nto the prayers made in the pleadings. That\napart, in civil suits, grant of relief is\ncircumscribed by various factors like court\nfee, limitation, parties to the suits, as also\ngrounds barring relief, like res Judicata,\nestoppel, acquiescence, non-joinder of causes\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 90 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nof action or parties, etc., which require\npleading and proof. Therefore, it would be\nhazardous to hold that in a civil suit whatever\nbe the relief that is prayed, the court can on\nexamination of facts grant any relief as it\nthinks fit. In a suit for recovery of rupees one\nlakh, the court cannot grant a decree for\nrupees ten lakhs. In a suit for recovery\npossession of property 'A', court cannot grant\npossession of property \"B'. In a suit praying\nfor permanent injunction, court cannot grant a\nrelief of declaration or possession. The\njurisdiction to grant relief in a civil suit\nnecessarily depends on the pleadings, prayer,\ncourt fee paid, evidence let in, etc.\n\n24. In the absence of a claim by the plaintiffs\nbased on an easementary right, the first\ndefendant did not have an opportunity to\ndemonstrate that the plaintiffs had no\neasementary right. In the absence of pleadings\nand an opportunity to the first defendant to\ndeny such claim, the High Court could not\nhave converted a suit for title into a suit for\nenforcement of an easementary right. The first\nappellate court had recorded a finding of fact\nthat the plaintiffs had not made out title. The\nHigh Court in second appeal did not disturb\nthe said finding. As no question of law arose\nfor consideration, the High Court ought to\nhave dismissed the second appeal. Even if i the\nHigh Court felt t that a case for easement was\nmade out, at best liberty could have been\nreserved to the plaintiffs to file a separate suit\nfor easement. But the High Court could not, in\na second appeal, while rejecting the plea of\nthe plaintiffs that they were owners of the suit\nproperty, grant the relief of injunction in\nregard to an easementary right by assuming\nthat they had an easementary right to use the\nschedule property as a passage.\"\n\n153. Keeping in view the above, the plea of the learned counsel for\nthe plaintiff that even otherwise, the lease should be treated to have\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 91 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nbeen terminated and an order of eviction be passed against the\ndefendant no.1, cannot be accepted.\n\n154. Even on facts, I do not find much merit in the submission of the\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff. It was for the plaintiff to have shown\nthe amount of rent being received by the defendant no.1 from the sub-\nlessee, in order to bring the lease out of the purview of the\nDRC Act\n.\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiff has been unable to show any\ndocument, which would satisfy this Court on the amount of rent being\nreceived for the Suit Property by the defendant no.1, if any, as on the\ndate of filing of the Suit or even thereafter. Mere assertion that at one\npoint of time the licence fee being received by the defendant no.1 was\nmore than Rs.3,500/-, in my view, may not be sufficient to bring the\ntenancy of the defendant no.1 out of the protection granted under the\n\nDRC Act\n.\n\n155. In addition, the defendant no.1 has pleaded a right in the\nproperty as a subrogatee mortgagee. She has not claimed that she has\nan exclusive title to the same. Therefore,\nSection 111(g)\nof the TP Act\nwould also not come to the aid of the plaintiff in the present case.\n\n156. As far as the claim of the plaintiff that the lease has been\nforfeited under\nSection 111(d)\nof the TP Act, is concerned, the same\nalso does not hold much water. In terms of the Will dated 06.02.1973\n(Ex. PW-4/2) of late Smt. Abnash Kaur, the defendant no.1 received\nonly 1/6th share in the Suit Property. For the application of\nSection\n111(d)\nof the TP Act, the whole of the property has to be vested in the\nlessee for the termination of the lease to take place.\n\nSettlement Agreement dated 12.02.1991\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 92 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n157. It was the case of the plaintiff that the defendant no.1 had\nproposed the terms of the Settlement, by a document dated 12.02.1991\n(Ex. PW-4/27), acknowledging the rights of the plaintiff in the Suit\nProperty. The said document was denied by defendant no.1. The\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff, in the course of his submissions,\nsubmitted that the defendant no.1 had produced one Shri Deepak Jain\n(DW-3) as a handwriting expert, whose testimony is totally unreliable\nnot only because he is not an expert, but also because he has not stated\nto have used the scientific techniques for comparison of the signatures\nand, even otherwise, his report is totally doubtful. He submitted that,\ntherefore, the document dated 12.02.1991 (Ex. PW-4/27) should be\nconsidered by this Court as proved.\n\n158. While I find merit in the submission of the learned counsel for\nthe plaintiff that the evidence of Shri Deepak Jain is not worthy of\nreliance for the reasons that the learned counsel for the plaintiff has\ncontended, at the same time, once the document is denied by the\nperson, who is alleged to have executed it, the onus of proving the\ndocument lies on the plaintiff, who is the propounder thereof. The\nlearned counsel for the plaintiff has not drawn my attention to any\nevidence by which the plaintiff has proved the said document. Merely\nbecause the defendant no.1 may have failed to disprove the same, does\nnot mean that automatically the document shall stand proved in\nevidence.\n\n159. In the absence of any such evidence proving the document\n12.02.1991 (Ex. PW-4/27), the claim of the plaintiff cannot be\naccepted.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 93 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nWhether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of partition?:\n\n160. In view of the above, it has to be held that the status of the\nparties to the Suit as co-owner of the Suit Property has not undergone\na change. As a co-owner, the plaintiff is entitled to seek partition of\nthe Suit Property, and the same can be resisted by the defendant no.1\nonly so long as the plaintiff and the other co-owners do not contribute\ntheir share of the redemption amount, along with interest as stipulated\nin the original Mortgage Deeds dated 19.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/42) and\n24.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/43), to the defendant no.1. Once the share is\npaid by them, the right of the defendant no. 1 as a subrogatee\nmortgagee shall come to an end.\n\nShare of the parties in the Suit Property:\n\n161. Due to the death of the original plaintiff- late Shri Ajit Singh,\nthe original defendant no. 3, late Smt. Surjit Kaur Gill, and the\noriginal defendant no. 5, Late Shri Kamal Kishore Bindal, the rights of\nthe parties are determined as under:-\n\n(a) Plaintiff: 33.34% (as for himself\nand as LR of late Smt.\nSurjit Kaur Gill)\n(b) Defendant no.1: 16.67%\n(c) Defendant no.2: 16.67%\n(d) legatees under the Will dated\n21.07.1997 (Ex.PW-2/1)\nof late Sh.Ajit Singh, with the\n\npresent plaintiff as executor of the Will: 16.67%\n\n(e) Half-brothers of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 94 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\nlate Shri Kamal Kishore Bindal: 16.67%\n\n162. However, as far as the share in the Suit Property devolving on\nthe death of Shri Ajit Singh, is concerned, the same shall devolve on\nhis legatees in accordance with his Will dated 21.07.1997 (Ex. PW-\n\n2/1). The plaintiff-Shri Gurnir Singh Gill shall hold his share for the\nlegatees of late Shri Ajit Singh in trust and in a fiduciary capacity.\n\nFindings on the Issues:\n\n163. In view of the above discussion, I render the following findings\non the issues that were framed by this Court vide its Order dated\n01.02.2005.\n\nIssue 1 - Whether the suit is barred by limitation? OPD-1\n\n164. The Suit cannot be said to be barred by limitation. The issue is\ndecided accordingly.\n\nIssue 2 - Whether the plaint has been valued correctly for purposes\nof Court Fee and Jurisdiction. If not, to what effect? OPD\n\n165. As held hereinabove, the possession of the defendant no.1 to the\nSuit Property was as a lessee or a co-owner or as a permissive user as\na subrogatee mortgagee. Once the relief of possession is granted to the\nplaintiff, the plaintiff would, even otherwise, have to pay the Court\nFee in accordance with his share of the Suit Property. The issue is\nanswered accordingly.\n\nIssue 3 - Whether redemption of the mortgage by the defendant no.\n1 entitles the defendant no.1 to retain possession of property bearing\nNo.3, South End Road, New Delhi? OPD-1\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 95 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n166. In terms of the Compromise Decree dated 20.02.1978 passed in\nRFA(OS)11/1971, titled Smt. Abnash Kaur through LRs. v. Smt.\nSushila Daphtary and Anr.(Ex. PW-4/DX8), the defendant no.1 is\nentitled to retain the possession of the property bearing No.3, South\nEnd Road, New Delhi, till such time the plaintiff and the other co-\nsharer contribute and pay their contribution of the redemption amount\nalong with interest to the defendant no.1. The learned counsel for the\nplaintiff, in the course of his submissions, has submitted that the\nplaintiff is ready and willing to pay the said amount to the defendant\nno.1. On the plaintiff paying the said amount to the defendant no.1,\nthe defendant no.1 would not be entitled to retain the possession of the\nSuit Property in her capacity as a subrogate mortgagee. The issue is\ndecided accordingly.\n\nIssue 4 - Whether the lease deed dated 18.11.1958 is a sham\ndocument as alleged by the plaintiff in paras 20 to 23 of the plaint\nand as explained in subsequent paragraphs thereof? OPP\n\n167. As held hereinabove, the plaintiff has failed to prove that the\nLease Deed dated 18.11.1958 is a sham document or that the\ndefendant no.1 was acting only as a benamidar of the owner, that is,\nlate Smt. Abnash Kaur. The issue is decided accordingly.\nIssue 5 - If issue no.4 is held in favour of the plaintiff, what would\nbe the legal consequences thereof?\n\n168. In view of the finding on issue no.4, this issue does not survive.\nIssue 6 - Whether late Smt.Abnash Kaur left behind any moveable\nproperties as asserted by the plaintiff? OPP\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed CS(OS) 2167/1993 Page 96 of 99\n\nBy:SUNIL\n\nSigning Date:25.10.2024\n\n17:32:42\n\n169. In view of the statement of the learned counsel for the plaintiff\nrecorded on 19.05.2023 and 19.07.2023, and the affidavit of the\nplaintiff dated 26.07.2023, this issue no longer survives.\nIssue 7 - What is the share of the plaintiffs and the defendants in the\nestate left behind by late Smt.Abnash Kaur?\n\n170. In view of the findings hereinabove, the shares of the parties\nhave been stated in paragraph 161 hereinabove. The issue is answered\naccordingly.\n\nIssue 8 - Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary decree of\npartition in respect of property bearing No.3, South End Road, New\nDelhi? OPP\n\n171. The plaintiff is held entitled to a preliminary decree of partition\nin respect of the Suit Property, however, subject to the plaintiff\ncontributing his share of the redemption amount along with interest in\nterms of the Mortgage Deeds dated 19.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/42) and\n24.01.1959 (Ex. DW-1/43) to defendant no.1. The issue is answered\naccordingly.\n\nIssue 9 - Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree for rendition of\naccounts against defendant No. 1? OPP\n\n172. The plaintiff is not held entitled to a decree of rendition of\naccounts against the defendant no.1 inasmuch as the defendant no.1\ncontinues to be entitled to the possession of the Suit Property not only\nas a lessee thereof but also in terms of the Compromise Decree dated\n20.02.1978 passed in RFA(OS)11/1971, titled Smt.
