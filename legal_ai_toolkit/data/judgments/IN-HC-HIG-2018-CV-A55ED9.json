The suit in O.S.No.493 of 1993 was filed by one Palaniandi and\n\nthe respondents 1 and 2 herein. Since Palaniandi died after the suit, his\n\nlegal representatives were brought on record and arrayed as respondents 3 to\n\n6 herein. A preliminary decree came to be passed by the Trial Court on\n\n26.10.1998. An appeal was taken there from to this Court in A.S.No.861 of\n\n1998, which came to be disposed of on 22.09.2008. Thereafter, the\n\nplaintiffs in the suit filed an application in I.A.No.172 of 2010 seeking\n\ndetermination of the income from the suit properties. The application came\n\nto be filed under Order 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C.\n\n3. The learned Principal Sub-Ordinate Judge, Cuddalore by an\n\norder dated 12.01.2016 fixed the income from the suit properties, which\n\nresulted in a direction to the petitioner herein to pay a sum of\n\n3/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nRs.1,00,19,890/- with subsequent interest at 6% per annum from the date of\n\nthe suit till date of realization. Aggrieved by this fixation, the petitioner,\n\nwho is the sole defendant in the suit preferred an appeal in A.S.No.30 of\n\n2016 on the file of the Principal District Judge, Cuddalore. The appeal was\n\nvalued under Section 37(2) of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation\n\nAct and a fixed court fee of Rs.750/- was paid. The respondents herein filed\n\nI.A.No.260 of 2016 under Section 44 r/w 52 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees\n\nand Suits Valuation Act, directing the appellant to pay ad valorem court fee\n\nat the rate of 7.5% contending that an appeal against an order determining\n\nmesne profits ought to be valued under Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court\n\nFees and Suits Valuation Act and the Court fee payable is on the income\n\nascertained by the Court. They would also rely upon the direction made in\n\nthe order of the Trial Court requiring them to pay Court fee at 7.5% per\n\nannum.\n\n4. This application was opposed by the petitioner herein\n\ncontending that the order passed by the Trial court though on an application\n\nunder\nOrder 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C\n, is not an order ascertaining mesne profits.\n\n4/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nIt is actually an order passed under\nOrder 20 Rule 18 of C.P.C\n., where the\n\ncourt is empowered to determine the share of the income of the parties as\n\nper the preliminary decree. Therefore, according to the petitioner herein,\n\nthe appeal is not against an order passed under\nOrder 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C\nas\n\nOrder 20 Rule 12 could be invoked only in cases where there is a decree for\n\npossession against a person, who is found to be in illegal occupation of the\n\nproperty.\n\n5. It is the further contention of the petitioner herein that Section\n\n44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suit Valuation Act will apply only in\n\ncases where a decree for mesne profits granted by the Court as against\n\nperson who is in illegal possession and not against the sharer in suit for\n\npartition. On the above contentions, the petitioner herein claim that the\n\ncourt fee that has been paid is just and proper. The learned Principal\n\nDistrict Judge, who heard the application concluded that since the appeal is\n\nagainst an order determining mesne profits under Order 20 Rule 12, it is\n\nSection 44\nof the Court fee Act that would apply and therefore, the appellant\n\nought to have valued the appeal and paid ad valorem court fee at 7.5% of\n\n5/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nthe share of the income that was determined by the Trial Court. It is the\n\ncorrectness of this order, which is questioned in this revision.\n\n6. I have heard Mr.V.Raghavachari, learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner, Mr.N.Suresh, learned counsel for the contesting respondents.\n\nSince the matter involved in payment of Court fee, I had directed issuance\n\nof notice to the Additional Government Pleader (CS) and I have heard\n\nMr.Y.T.Aravind Gosh, learned Additional Government Pleader (CS) also.\n\n7. The application before the Trial Court namely, the application\n\nin I.A.No.172 of 2010 was filed under\nOrder 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C\n.\nOrder 20\n\nRule 12 of C.P.C\nreads as follows:-\n\n“12. Decree for possession and mesne profits.- (1) Where a suit\nis for the recovery of possession of immovable property and for\nrent or mesne profits, the court may pass a decree—\n\n(a) for the possession of the property;\n\n(b) for the rents which have accrued on the property during the\nperiod prior to the institution of the suit or direction an inquiry as\nto such rent;\n\n(ba) for the mesne profits or directing an inquiry as to such mesne\n\n6/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nprofits;\n\n(c) directing an inquiry as to rent or mesne profits from the\ninstitution of the suit until—\n\n(i) the delivery of possession to the decree holder,\n\n(ii) the relinquishment of possession by the judgment debtor with\nnotice to the decree holder through the court, or\n\n(iii) the expiration of three years from the date of the decree,\nwhichever event first occurs.\n\n(2) Where an inquiry is directed under clause (b) or\n\nclause (c), a final decree in respect of the rent or mesne profits\n\nshall be passed in accordance with the result of such inquiry.\n\n(3) Where an Appellate Court directs such an inquiry, it\nmay direct the Court of first instance to make the inquiry, and in\nevery case the Court of first instance may of its own accord, and\nshall whenever moved to do so by the decree holder inquire and\npass the final decree.”\n\nA very reading of the above provision would show that it will not\n\napply to a suit for partition.\n\n7. Subsection 12 of\nSection 2\nof C.P.C defines the term mesne\n\n7/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nprofits and it reads as follows:-\n\n“(12)\"Mesne profits” of property means those profits\nwhich the person in wrongful possession of such property actually\nreceived or might with ordinary diligence have received\ntherefrom, together with interest on such profits, but shall not\ninclude profits due to improvements made by the person in\nwrongful possession.”\n\n8. From the definition, it could be gathered that mesne profits is\n\nreferable to those profits, which a person in “wrongful possession”\n\nreceived. As regards the partition action is concerned, the sharers are\n\ndeemed to be in joint possession and possession of one of the sharers is on\n\nbehalf of the others also. Therefore, it cannot be said that a sharer in\n\npossession of a joint property is in wrongful possession of the property.\n\nTherefore, a determination of the share of the income from the properties\n\nsubject matter of a partition suit cannot be termed as determining mesne\n\nprofits within the meaning of\nOrder 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C\n. The nature of\n\nsuch determination is no longer res-integra. The nature and character of the\n\nproceeds from the estate subject matter of a suit for partition was subject\n\n8/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nmatter of a several decisions of this Court as well as the other High Courts.\n\n9.\nIn\nRamaswami Iyer Vs. Subramania Iyer\nreported in AIR\n\n1923 Mad 147, a Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court had an occasion to\n\nconsider the nature of the liability of a manager to account for profits\n\nsubsequent to the suit.\nAfter referring to the judgment of the Privy council\n\nin Prithi Pal Vs. Jowahir singh reported in ILR 14 Cal 493, this Court had\n\nobserved as follows:-\n\n\"8. As pointed out by their Lordships a member of a\nHindu family suing for partition and for the profits on his share is\nreally suing for an account of the profits received by the manager\nor the persons in possession so that the proceeds so received by\nthe latter which are also divisible property, may be divided and\nhis share therein also given to him. As stated by their Lordships at\npage 512, a sharer has a \"clear right\" to an account of the\nprofits received by the person in possession of the whole, and to\nbe awarded his share thereof, not as mesne profits received by a\nperson in wrongful possession but as appurtenant to the\nplaintiff's right in his share of the lands.” (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n“10.I might also refer to the judgment of Abdul Rahim,\n\n9/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nJ. and Oldfield, J. in A.S. No. 322 of 1919 explaining Ghulsam\nBivi v. Ahamadsa Rowther (1919) I.L.R 42 Mad.\n296 and to the\ndecision in\nRamnath Choturam v. Goturam Radhakishan\n(1920)\nI.L.R. Bom. 179, and the other decisions referred to in the latter\ncase in support of the following conclusions: (1) That Order 20\nRule 12,\nCode of Civil Procedure\n, relating to technical \"mesne\nprofits\" does not apply to the claim of a plaintiff suing for\npartition of lands and the profits which are accruing on the lands\nwhich ultimately might fall to his share under the decree, (2) That\nunless a preliminary decree for partition refused or should be\ndeemed to have refused to grant profits, the Court is not\nprecluded from granting profits in its final decree.”\n\n10. The question relating to proper Court fee payable in a suit for\n\npartition and accounts was considered by this Court in\nChandra Bhogi Vs.\n\nGuddappa Bhandary\nreported in 66 LW Page 348. After referring to\n\nvarious judgments cited at the bar, the Hon'ble Justice. Subba Rao as he\n\nthen was had held as follows:\n\n“6. From the aforesaid discussion of the case law the following\nprinciples emerge:\n\n10/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\n(1) The court fee payable for a relief of partition in a\nsuit as well as In the appeal is only the fixed court fee payable\nunder Article 17-\nB of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act\n.\n\n(2) If the relief of accounting or any other relief is an\ninherent part of the main relief of partition and implied therein, it\nis not necessary to value that relief separately. The court fee paid\non the relief for partition would cover the other relief also. In\nsuch a case if the relief claimed in an appeal is only that implied\nin the main relief for partition, the fixed court fee under Article\n17-B of Schedule II will suffice.\n\n(3) But if the relief for rendition of accounts relates to a\ndifferent subject matter such as a relief for accounting against a\nmanager of a Joint Hindu family on the ground of fraud or\nimproper conduct, a separate court fee has to be paid both in the\nsuit as well as in the appeal. In such cases the principle of the\nFull Bench decision in -- 'AIR 1938 Mad 435 (E)', will apply and\n'ad valorem' court fee is payable in appeal on the amount\ndecreed.\n\n7. In the instant case, the appeals relate only to the sum\nof Rs. 21600 representing the share of the other members in the\nsale proceeds of the clay realised by the appellants. That amount,\ntherefore, only represents the value of the respondents' share in\none of the assets of the family. Looking into the accounts by the\n\n11/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nCommissioner or the court for ascertaining the value of that asset\nis Incidental to the relief of partition and is implied therein. I\ntherefore hold that the appellants have correctly valued their\nrelief in the appeals by paying the fixed fee of Rs. 100 under\nArticle 17-\nB of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act\n.”\n\n11. A similar question as to the nature of the claim for accounting\n\nin the suit for partition was considered by a Hon'ble Full Bench of this\n\nCourt in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya reported in 1951 (2) MLJ 176. The\n\nessential question that was raised was as to whether the Court directed any\n\nenquiry into future profits in a partition suit where, the preliminary decree is\n\nsilent. The main objection that was raised before the Hon'ble Full Bench\n\nwas that since the preliminary decree passed in the suit did not direct an\n\nenquiry into the accounts and recovery of profits, the Court cannot direct\n\nenquiry and pass a final decree for such income. The correctness of the\n\njudgment of the Hon'ble Division Bench in Ghulusam Bibi Vs. Ahamadsa\n\nRowther was considered by the Hon'ble full bench. While considering the\n\nquestion, the Hon'ble full bench had observed as follows:-\n\n“3. It is necessary at the outset to distinguish between\n\n12/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nthree different types of cases in which a question of profits or\nmesne profits might arise : (1) Suits for ejectment or recovery of\npossession of immoveable property from a person in possession\nwithout title, together with a claim for past or past & future\nmesne profits. (2) Suits for partition by one or more tenants-in-\ncommon against others with a claim for account of past or past &\nfuture profits. (3) Suits for partition by a member of a joint Hindu\nfamily with a claim for an account from the manager. In the first\ncase, the possession of the defts. not being lawful, the plff. is\nentitled to recover \"mesne profits\" as defined in\nSection 2\n, Clause\n(12), Civ. P. C., such profits being really in the nature of damages.\n\nIn the second case, the possession & receipt of profits by the deft,\nnot being wrongful the plff's. remedy is to have an account of\nsuch profits making all just allowances in favour of the collecting\ntenant in common. In the third case, the plff. must take the joint\nfamily property as it exists at the date of the demand for partition\nand is not entitled to open up past accounts or claim relief on the\nground of past inequality of enjoyment of the profit, except where\nthe manager has been guilty of fraudulent conduct or\nmisappropriation. The plff. would, however, be in the position of a\ntenant-in-common from the date of severance in status & his\nrights would have to be worked out on that basis.”\n\n13/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\n12. The Hon'ble full bench also considered the scope of Order 20\n\nRule 12 and Order 20 Rule 18. It was observed that while Order 20 Rule 12\n\nwould apply to the first category of suits mentioned above, Order 20 Rule\n\n18 would apply to the second and third categories of the suits. The Hon'ble\n\nfull bench concluded that since the profits arising from the estate forming\n\npart of a partition suit, also form part of such estate are liable to be\n\npartitioned under the final decree. Even without a specific prayer in the\n\nplaint for an account of such profits and division there of the court can\n\ndetermine such profits and direct the sharer in possession to pay such share\n\nto the suing sharer, the Hon'ble Full Bench summarised its conclusion as\n\nfollows:-\n\n“13. We may now summarise our conclusions. A\npartition suit in which a preliminary decree has been passed is\nstill a pending suit & the rights of the parties have to be adjusted\nas on the date of the final decree: Jadunath v. Parameswar, I.L.R.\n(1940) 1 Cal. 255. In such a suit the Court has not only to divide\nthe common properties but has also to adjust the equities arising\nbetween the parties oat of their relation to the common property\nthe property to be divided. The preliminary decree determines the\nmoieties of the respective parties & thereby furnishes the basis\n\n14/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nupon which the division of the property has to be made. There are\nother matters in addition to the moieties of the parties that have\nto be considered & decided before an equitable final partition can\nbe effected. Among them are the realisation of common\noutstandings, the discharge of common liabilities, the distribution\nof the profits of the properties realised pending the suit, either in\ncash or by allotment of property of the requisite value, the grant\nof owelty, the provision of maintenance to parties entitled thereto,\nthe allotment of lands on which improvements have been effected\nto the sharer who has improved them, the allotment of alienated\nlands to the share of the alienor & other similar matters. Even\nafter the passing of the preliminary decree it is open to the Court\nto give appropriate directions regarding all or any of these\nmatters either suo motu or on the application of the parties.\n\nOrder 20, Rule 18, Civ. P. C. does not prohibit the Court from\nissuing such directions after the stage of a preliminary decree. It\nis open to the Court in order to prevent multiplicity of litigation &\nto do complete justice & effect an equal division of all the\ncommon assets & properties among the parties, to direct an\nenquiry into the profits received or realised by one or some of\nthem daring the pendency of the suit & to award the others their\nproper share of, such profits under its final decree. This enquiry\ncan be ordered either as part of the preliminary decree itself or\n\n15/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nsubsequently as a step towards the passing of the final decree, &\nin either case the result of the enquiry has to be incorporated in\nthe final decree.”\n\nThe above judgment of the Hon'ble full bench lays to rest the\n\ncontroversy regarding the nature of the determination of the share in the\n\nincome of a suing sharer in a suit for partition. Hon'ble Justice. V. Ratnam as\n\nhe then was in\nD.Nataraja Achari Vs. Balambal Ammal\nreported in 1979\n\n(2) MLJ 234 considered the difference between the determination under\n\nOrder20 Rule 12 and\nOrder 20 Rule 18 C.P.C\n. After referring to the\n\njudgment of the full bench in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya, it was held that the\n\ndetermination of profits in a partition suit would fall under\nOrder 20 Rule\n\n18 of C.P.C\nand not under\nOrder 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C\n. Having held so, the\n\nclaim of the appellants that the Court cannot grant mesne profits beyond a\n\nperiod of three years from the date of the decree was rejected. While doing\n\nso, this Court observed as follows:-\n\n6. The Full Bench also held that Order 20, Rule 12,\nCivil Procedure Code, deals with the first class of suits above\nreferred, while Order 20, Rule 18 would take in suits in the\nsecond and third categories. It was also further held that Order\n\n16/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\n20, Rule 12 relates to \"mesne profits\" in the sense in which that\nexpression is defined in\nSection 2(12)\nof the Civil Procedure Code\nand that the claim of the plaintiff suing for partition and his share\nof profits accruing from the lands pending the suit is not, properly\nspeaking, a claim for mesne profits and Order 20, Rule 12 Civil\nProcedure Code, has no application to such a case. The learned\nCounsel for the appellant, however, would strongly rely upon a\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Chittoori Subbamma v.\n\nKadappa Subbanna and Ors. and urge that the first respondent\ncannot be granted a decree in respect of mesne profits in excess\nof three years from the date of the decree. The question, therefore,\nis whether the first respondent decree-holder could be denied her\nshare of the income for a period in excess of three years. The\nscope and applicability of the judgment of the Supreme Court\nrelied upon by the learned Counsel for the appellant was the\nsubject-matter of the judgment of a Division Bench reported in\n\nSubba Reddiar v Hara Bibi\n.\nIn that case also, the same objection\nthat is being raised in the present second appeal by the learned\nCounsel for the appellant was raised, relying upon the aforesaid\njudgment of the Supreme Court reported in Subbamma's case.\nThe Division Bench examined the provisions of Order 20, Rule 12\nand Order 20, Rule 18. Civil Procedure Code, and followed the\nratio of the Full Bench of this Court reported in Basavayya v.\n\n17/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nGuruvayya , and ultimately held that\nOrder 20, Rule 12 of the\nCode of Civil Procedure\nwill not be applicable to a case like the\npresent case, because when an account of the income from the\nproperty pertaining to the share of the plaintiff is ordered up to\nthe date of the final decree what actually happens is the division\nof an integral portion of the hotch pot comprising of not only\nthe property but also the income and accretions thereto up to\nthe date of the final decree and to such a case, Order 20, Rule\n12 will be inapplicable. In addition, the Division Bench also\nexamined in detail the judgment of the Supreme Court and held\nthat a careful perusal of the minority and the majority views\nshows that the entire discussion related only to the scope of Order\n20, Rule 12, Civil Procedure Code, and in particular whether the\npreliminary decree would be binding upon the defendant at the\nstage of the final decree proceedings and whether the objection\nthat the period for the award of mesne profits should not exceed\nthree years could be allowed to be raised for the first time before\nthe High Court. It was also pointed out by the Division Bench\nthat in the judgment of the Supreme Court there is no reference\nwhatever to Order 20, Rule 18, Civil Procedure Code, which\ndeals with a case of suit for partition and mesne profits. It was\nalso further pointed out that the Full Bench decision of this Court\nreported in Basavayya's case was not even referred to and,\n\n18/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\ntherefore, it is rather difficult to countenance an argument that\nthe Supreme Court by implication intended to over-rule the view\ntaken by the Full Bench which has been followed in all other\ndecisions of other High Courts. That being the position, the\nquestion of the applicability of the provisions of Order 20, Rule\n12 to the instant case does not arise because in this case, though\nthe application purports to be one under Order 20, Rule 12, Civil\nProcedure Code, it would fall within the second and third\ncategories enumerated by the Full Bench and to which the\nprovisions of Order 20, Rule 12, will not be applicable Order 20,\nRule 18, Civil Procedure Code, would govern the present case\nand. therefore, the objection of the learned Counsel for the\nappellant that the mesne profits cannot be given for more than\nthree years from the date of the decree does not hold good.\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n14. The same question was considered by Hon'ble\n\nJustice.M.Srinivasan as he then was in\nP.Ponnammal and others Vs.\n\nKanakavalli Srinivasan and another\nreported in 1988 (2) LW 447.\nHere\n\nagain, the Hon'ble judge referred to judgment of the full bench in\n\nBasavayya's case to conclude as follows:-\n\n19/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\n“8. There is no substance in the contention of learned\nCounsel for the appellants that the application for the\nascertainment of mesne profits is barred by limitation, or that it is\nnot maintainable as there is no provision therefor in the\npreliminary decree. It is merely a misnomer to call it mesne\nprofits. The decree holders seek to have an account of the income\nfrom the property under Order 20, Rule 18,\nC.P.C\n., and it is not\nan application under Order 20, Rule 12,\nC.P.C\n. The law is well\nsettled that is too late in the day to question the right of a co-\nsharer in a partition suit to apply for ascertainment of the income\npertaining to his share after the passing of a preliminary decree\nfor partition. It is not necessary to refer to any authority other\nthan that of a Full Bench of this Court in\nBabburu Basavayya v.\nBabburu Guruvayya\n.\nThe following propositions\nlaid down by\nthe\nFull Bench are apposite A partition suit in which a preliminary\ndecree has been passed is still a pending suit and the rights of the\nparties have to be adjusted as on the date of the final decree;\nJudunath Ray v. Parameswar Mallik (1960) I.L.R. 1 Cal. 255\n(P.C.) In such a suit the court has not only to divide the common\nproperties but has also to adjust the equities arising between the\nparties out of their relation to the common property, the property\nto be divided. The preliminary decree determines the moieties of\n\n20/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nthe respective parties and thereby furnishes the basis upon which\nthe division of the property has to be made. There are other\nmatters in addition to the moieties of the parties that have to be\nconsidered and decided before an equitable final partition can be\neffected. Among them are the realisation of common outstandings,\nthen discharge of common liabilities, the distribution of the\nprofits of the properties realised pending the suit, either in cash\nor by allotment of property of the requisite value, the grant of\nowelty, the provisions of maintenance to parties entitled therein,\nthe allotment of lands on which improvements have been effected,\nto the sharer who has improved them the allotment of alienated\nlands to the share of the alienor and other similar matters. Even\nafter the passing of the preliminary decree it is open to the court\nto give appropriate directions regarding all or any of these\nmatters either suo motu or on the application of the parties.\nOrder 20, Rule 10,\nC.P.C\n. does not prohibit the court from issuing\nsuch directions after the stage of a preliminary decree. It is open\nto the court in order to prevent multiplicity of litigation and to do\ncomplete justice and effect an equal division of all the common\nassets and properties among the parties, to direct an enquiry into\nthe profits received or realised by one or some of them during the\npendency of the suit and to award the others their proper share or\nsuch profits under its final decree. This enquiry can be ordered\n\n21/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\neither as part of the preliminary decree itself or subsequently, as\na step towards the passing of the final decree, and in either case\nthe result of the enquiry has to be incorporated in the final\ndecree.\n\n9. There is no question of limitation as the proceedings\nhave been pending and the income has to be ascertained with\nreference to a period commencing from the date of suit.”\n\nIt could be seen that the Hon'ble Judge had in fact held that it will a\nmisnomer to call profits ascertained in a suit for partition as mesne profits.\n\n15. A Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court had also\n\nconsidered the similar question in\nParvathi and another Vs.\n\nVenkatramana Prasad and Others\nreported in ILR 2003 KAR 2304. In\n\nfact, the Hon'ble Division Bench had considered the question of correct\n\ncourt fee that is to be paid in an appeal, challenging the determination of\n\nprofits in a suit for partition.\n\nThe Hon'ble Division Bench had referred to\n\nthe judgment of the full bench of this Court in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya\n\nreported in 1951 (2) MLJ 176 and the judgment of the Hon'ble Division\n\nBench of this Court in\nRamaswami Iyer Vs. Subramania Iyer\nreported in\n\n22/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nAIR 1923 Mad 147 to conclude as follows:\n\n“18. The concept of 'mesne profits' is applicable to\n\ncases of wrongful possession and not partition. The right of a\ntenant-in-common or a co-owner to a share in the profits from a\nproperty in the enjoyment of another tenant-in-common, is not a\nright to mesne profits for wrongful possession, but a right\nappurtenant in his right to a share in the property. A suit for\npartition and accounts is governed by\nOrder 20 Rule 18 CPC\n.\nNeither Section 42 (relating to suits for mesne profits) nor Order\n20 Rule 12 (relating to suits for possession and mesne profits)\nrelied on by the first respondent, is relevant to a suit for partition\nand accounts and share in profits.\nSection 35\nof the Act governs\nsuits for partition with or without the ancillary relief of accounts.\n\nIn a final decree for partition, what is determined is the share of\nthe plaintiff in the profits from the property as a result of\nrendering of account by the tenant-in-common in physical\npossession or management, and not mesne profits.\n\n19. The learned Counsel for first respondent lastly\ncontended that if there is a complete ouster of the plaintiff from\npossession and enjoyment, then it is possible to claim mesne\nprofits. This contention is academic and need not retain us long.\nIf really there was such ouster, then the main suit for partition\nwill itself fall under\nSection 35(1)\nin which event the Court Fee\n\n23/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nhad to be computed on the market value of plaintiff's share. But\nwhere the suit is valued under\nSection 35(2)\nas in this case, by\ncontending that the plaintiff is in joint possession, there is no\nquestion of ouster and consequently no question of mesne profits.\n\n20. Therefore, we hold that\nSection 42\nof the Act is not\napplicable. We further hold that the relief relating to rendering\naccount and payment of plaintiff's share in profits, is an ancillary\nrelief for which no Separate Court Fee is payable. The Court fee\npayable under Section 49, on an appeal against a final decree\ndetermining profits from the date of suit till the date of delivery of\npossession, would be the same as the Court fee that was paid in\nthe Court of first instance and it is not necessary to pay ad\nvalorem Court fee on the amount determined as profits. In this\ncase, the Court fee payable and paid in the Court of first instance\nwas Rs. 200/-. Therefore, Court fee payable on the appeal will be\nRs. 200.00.”\n\n16. The Kerela High Court has considered the similar question in\n\nMariyumma Vs. Kunhambu Nair reported in 1967 KLT 1017 and Abu\n\nand Others Vs. Thithikutty Umma and others reported in 1968 KLJ 549.\n\nThe Division Bench in Mariyumma Vs. Kunhambu Nair had after referring\n\nto the judgment of the full bench of this Court held as follows:-\n\n24/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\n“7. We are in respectful agreement with the dictum\nlaid down by the Full Bench in Basavayya Vs. Guruvayya (AIR\n1951 Mad. 938 FB) and also the aforesaid decisions of the\nAndhra Pradesh High Court. In a suit for partition, the court\nhas not only to divide the common properties but also to adjust\nequities arising between the parties out of their relation to the\ncommon property sought to be divided. A sharer claiming\npartition has a clear right to an account of the profits received\nby the person in possession of the common property and to be\nawarded his share thereof not as mesne profits but as\nappurtenant to his right in his share of the lands. The profits\naccruing from the common properties forming the subject\nmatter of the division during the pendency of the suit form part\nand parcel of the corpus itself and are as much in the hotchpot\nas the lands themselves. It is not correct to regard the claim\nfor profits put forward in a suit for partition by a sharer of\njoint family property or of co-ownership property as a claim\nfor mesne profits falling under\nOrder 20 Rule 12 of C.P.C\n. In\nour view, it is part of the legitimate function of a court passing\na final decree in a suit for partition and effectuating a division\nof properties pursuant to a preliminary decree to make a\ndivision of the profits that have accrued from such properties\npending the suit as such profits really form part of the corpus\n\n25/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\navailable for division.”\n\n17. In Abu and Others Vs. Thithikutty Umma and Others, a Single\n\nJudge of the Kerala High Court has reiterated the position that\n\ndetermination of shares in a suit for partition will not fall under Order 20\n\nRule 12 and therefore, separate Court fee need not be paid under\nSection 37\n\nof the Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act, 1959 ( Act of 1960, Kerala).\n\nMaking a distinction between decree for profits in a suit for partition as\n\ndetermined under Order 20 Rule 18 and determination of mesne profits\n\nunder Order 20 Rule 12, the learned Judge held that the profits ascertained\n\nunder Order 20 Rule 18 being one of the incidents of the suit for partition, it\n\nbecomes a component part of the decree and therefore, separate Court fee\n\nneed not be paid while a challenge is made to such determination. This\n\nreasoning is essentially based on the law laid down by the full bench of this\n\nCourt in Basavayya's case to the effect in a partition action, the profits\n\ndetermining under Order 20 Rule 18 also forms part of the shares and it\n\ncannot be called as mesne profits stricto sensu. Recently, in Dr.Rachel\n\nZachariah Vs. Dr.M.P.Korah, the another Single Bench of the Kerala High\n\n26/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nCourt reiterated the very same position of law after referring to the above\n\ntwo decisions of the Kerela High Court.\n\n18. Mr.N.Suresh, learned counsel for the respondents would\n\nvehemently contend that de-hors the law laid down by the full bench when\n\nthere is a determination of profits at the particular amount and the defendant\n\nseeks to avoid liability of that particular amount, he has to pay ad valorem\n\ncourt fee under Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation\n\nAct. Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act reads\n\nas follows:-\n\n“44. Suits for mesne profits. - (1) In a suit for mesne\nprofits or for immovable property and mesne profits, fee shall\nin respect of mesne profits be computed, where the amount is\nstated approximately and sued for, on such amount. If the\nprofits ascertained to be due to the plaintiff are in excess of the\nprofits as approximately estimated and sued for, no decree\nshall be passed until the difference between the fee actually\npaid and the fee that would have been payable had the suit\ncomprised the whole of the profits so ascertained is paid.\n\n(2) Where a decree directs an enquiry as to the\nmesne profits which have accrued on the property, whether\n\n27/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nprior or subsequent to the institution of the suit, no final decree\nshall be passed till the difference between the fee actually paid\nand the fee which would have been payable had the suit\ncomprised the whole of the profits accrued due till the date of\nsuch decree is paid.\n\n(3) Where, for a period subsequent to the date of the\ndecree or final decree, such decree or final decree directs\npayment of mesne profits at a specified rate, such decree or\nfinal decree shall not be executed until the fee computed on the\namount claimed in execution has been paid.”\n\nSection 44 provides for payment of Court fee in a suit for\n\npossession and mesne profits. The definition of the term 'mesne profits' as\n\nfound in\nthe C.P.C\n., has been extracted above. It is referable only to\n\nwrongful possession. The Full bench of this Court in Basavayya's case\n\nclearly laid down that Order 20 Rule 12 will not apply to a partition suit and\n\nthe determination of profits if any made in a partition suit is essentially\n\nunder Order 20 Rule 18 and not Order 20 Rule 12.\n\n19. Mr.N.Suresh would however draw my attention to the\n\njudgment of the five bench of this Court in Inre Dhanukodi Nayakkar and\n\n28/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nothers reported in AIR 1938 Mad 435 wherein, the Hon'ble full bench\n\nconsidered the court fee payable in a suit for accounts falling under\nSection\n\n7(iv)(f)\nof the Court Fees Act, 1870. The Hon'ble Full Bench held as\n\nfollows:--\n\n“The section gives great freedom to plaintiff-\nappellants, but we do not consider that it gives the same\nfreedom to defendant-appellants. When a defendant-appellant\nappeals against a final decree he knows exactly the value of his\nrelief. It follows that we consider that 56 Mad 705 was\nwrongly decided and therefore should not be followed.”\n\n20. I am afraid that the said decision may not be helpful in\n\nconsidering the question that crops up in this revision in as much as the full\n\nbench was concerned with a suit for accounts filed under\nSection 7(iv)(f)\nof\n\nthe Court fees Act, 1817, which is equivalent to\nSection 35\nof the present\n\nAct.\nSection 35\nessentially deals with suits for accounts. The determination\n\nof profits in a partition suit has been held to be incidental to the relief of\n\npartition. Therefore, the said judgment cannot be taken as a precedent to\n\ndetermine the question arising in this revision.\n\n29/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\n21. Mr.N.Suresh would also rely upon the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Justice. V. Ratnam as he then was in Thulasibai Ammal -Vs-Kanna\n\nPandithar reported in 1981(2) MLJ 250, wherein, a challenge was made to\n\ndirection to the petitioner to pay owelty in a suit for partition in order to\n\nequalize deficit in the value of the share allotted to the respondent. When\n\nthe said direction was challenged by way of an appeal, it was held that since\n\nthe petitioner is seeking to avoid his liability to pay owelty, ad valorem\n\nCourt fee will have to be paid and the petitioner cannot take advantage of\n\nArticle 17(b)\nto justify payment of fixed fee on the basis of the valuation in\n\nthe plaint. In doing so, the judgment in Inre Dhanukodi Nayakkar referred\n\nto above was relied upon. I do not think, the said judgment can also be\n\ntaken as a precedent in deciding the question of Court fee payable in a suit\n\nfor partition where, the challenge is to the determination of profits.\nThe\n\nvery same learned Judge has in\nNataraja Achari Vs. Balambal Ammal\n\nreported in 1979 2 MLJ 234 referred to Supra had noted the distinction\n\nbetween Order 20 Rule 12 and Order 20 Rule 18.\n\n22. My attention is also drawn to the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\n30/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nJustice Ramprasad Rao as he then was in\nKaruppanna Gounder Vs.\n\nSennimalai Gounder\nreported in 1977 1 MLJ 491. That was also a case\n\nwhere a decree for possession and mesne profits was challenged. Therefore,\n\nthe learned judge concluded that the Court fee should be payable on the\n\ndifference in mesne profits. That was a case to which Section 44 would\n\nautomatically apply. From the above discussion, the following principles\n\nemerge:-\n\n1) A suit for partition takes in itself a prayer for determination of\n\nthe share of the income of the plaintiff in the properties and there need not\n\nbe a separate prayer.\n\n2) The income determined in a suit for partition forms part of the\n\nestate in which the plaintiff would be entitled to his or her share even in\n\ncases where the preliminary decree does not grant such share and directs\n\ndetermination of such income.\n\n3) The determination of income in a suit for partition cannot be\n\ncalled as determination of mesne profits in the strict sense of the term as\n\nmesne profits contemplates wrongful possession.\n\n4) Once it is held that the determination of income is not mesne\n\n31/34\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n\nC.R.P.No. 1279 of 2018\n\nC.M.P.Nos. 6556 & 6557 of 2018\n\nprofits Section 44 of the Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act will\n\nnot apply.\n\n5) Once it is held that the income determined forms part of the\n\nestate while challenging the quantum, the appellant need not value it\n\nseparately and pay Court fee on such valuation, since he is not seeking to\n\navoid the liability but he is only questioning the quantum of liability.\n\n23. I therefore, find that the learned Principal District Judge was\n\nnot right in concluding that the court fee should be paid under Section 44 of\n\nthe Tamilnadu Court Fees and Suits Valuation Act. This civil revision\n\npetition is allowed, the order of the learned District Judge is set aside and\n\nI.A.No.260 of 2016 will stand dismissed. Consequently, connected\n\nmiscellaneous petitions are closed.
