The petitioner has also\n prayed that this court shall direct the learned arbitrator to deposit in this court all\n \n\n the records, paper and proceedings of the arbitration between the respondent no. 1\n \n\n (original claimant) and the society i.e. Apsara Coop. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. By the\n impugned award the learned arbitrator had declared that the MOU dated 30 th April,\n 2008 executed between M/s.

Ltd. is valid\n subsisting, enforceable and binding upon those parties and that the claimant is\n entitled to specific performance thereof.\n\n 2. At the threshold Mr. Samdani learned senior counsel for the respondent no. 1\n raises a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this petition. In view of the\n issue of maintainability raised by the learned senior counsel for respondent no. 1 I\n have heard the learned senior counsel for the petitioner as well as the respondent\n no. 1 on the issue of maintainability of this petition filed by the petitioners.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 3/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n 3. Mr.Samdani learned senior counsel for the respondent no. 1 submits that the\n\n \n memorandum of understanding which recorded an arbitration agreement was\n between the respondent no. 1 developer and M/s. Apsara Co-op. Hsg. Soc., Ltd a\n\n \n society registered under the provisions of \nMaharashtra Co-operative Societies Act,\n 1960\n. The said society consists of 24 tenements allotted to 24 persons who are\n members of the said society. Petitioners are three of the members of the said\n\n \n society. Learned senior counsel submits that the petitioners were not parties to the\n said memorandum of understanding which contained arbitration agreement. It is\n\n \n submitted that the society had passed a resolution pursuant to which dispute was\n referred to arbitration. The petitioners were not parties to the arbitration\n \n proceedings as they were not parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\n 4. It is submitted that since the petitioners were not parties to the arbitration\n agreement, petitioners cannot file a petition under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, for impugning an arbitral award. In support of this submission\n \n\n learned senior counsel invited my attention to \nsection 34\n and also definition of\n \n\n 'Party' defined under \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the Act. It is submitted by the learned\n senior counsel that only a party to the arbitration agreement can file a petition\n\n under \nsection 34\n of the Act and not an outsider. It is submitted that \nsection 34\n has\n to be read with \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the Act. There is no general power under \nsection\n 34\n of the Act to permit a person who is not a party to the arbitration agreement to\n file a petition for impugning an arbitral award. It is submitted that the said Apsara\n\n Co. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. who was party to the arbitration agreement and also before the\n learned arbitrator has accepted the arbitral award by passing a resolution. The\n impugned award has been acted upon by the society. The petitioners who are\n members of the society thus cannot be allowed to impugn the arbitral award as\n they were not parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 4/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n 5. Learned senior counsel submits that this court has no power to grant any\n\n \n leave to the petitioners to file arbitration petition and to impugn the arbitral award.\n It is submitted that this is not an appellate proceeding in which a party aggrieved\n\n \n can apply for leave to file an appeal. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on\n \nsection 36\n of the Mah. Coop. Societies Act, 1960 and submits that the society\n having registered is a body corporate and thus society only can be sued or sue in its\n\n \n own name. Society has to act through the committee. No members can file any\n proceedings on behalf of the society. It is submitted that the members of the\n\n \n society speak through society and has no independent say. \nIn support of this\n submission, learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of Division\n \n Bench of this court in case of \nGirish Mulchand Mehta Vs. Mahesh S.Mehta &\n Anr.\n 2010 (1) All MR 719 and in particular paragraphs 15 and 16 which read thus :\n\n \n15. The Appellants would then rely on the decision of the Apex\n Court in \nRamesh Himmatlal Shah v. Harsukh Jadhavji Joshi\n\n reported in MANU/SC/0531/1975 : AIR 1975 SC 1470 to\n \n\n contend that the flats in question occupied by them have been\n allotted to them by the Housing Society which allotment is\n \n\n coupled with the right to transfer their shares of the Society\n and interest in the said flat which is the property of the Society.\n\n \nIn \nthe said decision\n, the Apex Court has observed that the right\n so enjoyed by the member is the species of the property\n\n namely the right to occupy a flat of this type, which assumes\n significant importance and acquires under the law a stamp of\n transferability in furtherance of interest of commerce. It went\n on to observe that there is no fetter in any of the legal\n provisions against such a conclusion and for which reason the\n\n attachment and sale of the property of the member in execution\n of the decree are valid under the law. The legal position\n expounded by the Apex Court in \nthe said decision\n will be of no\n avail to the case on hand. The crucial question is whether the\n members can be heard to say that their rights in the flats\n occupied by them were dehors the rights of the Society therein\n and that they were not claiming under the Society at all. In our\n considered opinion such stand of the members(Appellants\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 5/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n herein) cannot be countenanced.\n\n 16. In the present case, it is not in dispute that the General\n Body of the Society which is supreme, has taken a conscious\n\n \n decision to redevelop the suit building. The General Body of\n the Society has also resolved to appoint the Respondent No. 1\n as the Developer. Those decisions have not been challenged at\n all. The Appellants who were members of the Society at the\n\n \n relevant time, are bound by the said decisions. The Appellants\n in the dispute filed before the Cooperative Court have only\n challenged the Resolution dated 27/4/2008, which challenge\n would merely revolve around the terms and conditions of the\n\n \n Development Agreement. \nAs a matter of fact, the General\n Body of the Society has approved the terms and conditions of\n \n the Development Agreement by overwhelming majority.\n Merely because the terms and conditions of the Development\n Agreement are not acceptable to the Appellants, who are in\n \n minuscule minority (only two out of twelve members), cannot\n be the basis not to abide by the decision of the overwhelming\n majority of the General Body of the Society. By now it is well\n established position that once a person becomes a member of\n the Cooperative Society, he looses his individuality with the\n \n\n Society and he has no independent rights except those given to\n \n\n him by the statute and Bye-laws. The member has to speak\n through the Society or rather the Society alone can act and\n speaks for him qua the rights and duties of the Society as a\n body (see \nDaman Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab\n reported in\n\n MANU/SC/0392/1985 : AIR 1985 SC 973).\n \nThis view has\n been followed in the subsequent decision of the Apex Court in\n the case of \nState of U.P. v. Chheoki Employees Cooperative\n Society Ltd.\n reported in MANU/SC/0332/1997 : AIR 1997 SC\n 1413. In this decision the Apex Court further observed that the\n\n member of Society has no independent right qua the Society\n and it is the Society that is entitled to represent as the\n corporate aggregate. The Court also observed that the stream\n cannot rise higher than the source. Suffice it to observe that so\n long as the Resolutions passed by the General Body of the\n Respondent No. 2 Society are in force and not overturned by a\n forum of competent jurisdiction, the said decisions would bind\n the Appellants. They cannot take a stand alone position but are\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 6/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n bound by the majority decision of the General Body. Notably,\n the Appellants have not challenged the Resolutions passed by\n\n \n the General Body of the Society to redevelop the property and\n more so, to appoint the Respondent No. 1 as the Developer to\n\n \n give him all the redevelopment rights. The propriety rights of\n the Appellants herein in the portion (in respective flats) of the\n property of the Society cannot defeat the rights accrued to the\n Developer and/or absolve the Society of its obligations in\n\n \n relation to the subject matter of the Arbitration Agreement. The\n fact that the relief prayed by the Respondent No. 1 in \nSection 9\n\n Petition and as granted by the Learned Single Judge would\n affect the propriety rights of the Appellants does not take the\n\n \n matter any further. For, the propriety rights of the Appellants in\n the flats in their possession would be subservient to the\n \n authority of the General Body of the Society. Moreso, such\n rights cannot be invoked against the Developer (Respondent\n No. 1) and in any case, cannot extricate the Society of its\n \n obligations under the Development Agreement. Since the relief\n prayed by the Respondent No. 1 would affect the Appellants,\n they were impleaded as party to the proceedings under \nSection\n 9\n of the Act, which was also necessitated by virtue of Rule\n 803E of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules. The\n \n\n said Rule reads thus:\n\n \" R803E. Notice of Filling Application to persons likely to\n be affected.-\n\n Upon any application by petition under the Act, the\n Judge in chambers shall, if he accepts the petition, direct\n notice thereof to be given to all persons mentioned in the\n petition and to such other persons as may seem to him to be\n likely to be affected by the proceedings, requiring all or any\n\n of such persons to show cause, within the time specified in\n the notice, why the relief sought in the petition should not\n be granted.\"\n\n 6. Mr. Samdani learned senior counsel submits that since the petition filed by\n the petitioners itself is not maintainable this court cannot enter into the merits of\n the matter and any adjudication on merits in these circumstances would be without\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 7/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n jurisdiction. \nIn support of this submission, learned senior counsel placed reliance\n\n \n on the judgment of Supreme Court in case of \nT.K.Lathika Vs. Seth Karsandas\n Jamnadas\n (1999) 6 SCC 632 and in particular paragraph 9. It is submitted that the\n\n \n said M/s. Apsara Coop. Hsg. Soc. Ltd. who were the parties to the arbitration\n proceedings have not been even impleaded as party respondent to this proceedings.\n\n 7. Mr. Thacker learned senior counsel for petitioners in reply to the preliminary\n objection raised by Mr. Samdani, learned senior counsel submits that the\n\n \n petitioners are admittedly the members of the said society. It is submitted that the\n petitioners being allottees of flats have right and interest to occupy their respective\n \n flats which rights can be even sold/transferred and can be attached in execution of\n the decree. It is submitted that since the society has in collusion with the\n \n respondent no. 1 has not impugned the arbitral award which was rendered against\n the society and in favour of the respondent no. 1 developer which affected the\n rights of the petitioners, petitioners being parties affected by the impugned award,\n \n\n are entitled to exercise their rights under \nsection 34\n of the said Act to impugn such\n \n\n arbitral award.\n\n 8. Learned senior counsel submits that even minority members of the society\n can challenge an arbitral award if the majority members have decided not to\n challenge the arbitral award for any reasons. It is submitted by the learned senior\n counsel that though petitioners were not parties to the arbitration proceedings,\n\n since the liability of the society as well as members are now crystalized under the\n said award and the rights of the petitioners having been affected and prejudiced,\n petitioners are entitled to challenge the impugned award. It is submitted by the\n learned senior counsel that this court has wide powers to grant leave to the\n petitioners to challenge the impugned award. Learned senior counsel submits\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 8/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n that the petitioners have very good chances of succeeding in this petition on merits\n\n \n and this court therefore, shall grant such leave in favour of the petitioners to\n impugn the arbitral award.\n\n 9. Learned senior counsel placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme\n Court in case of Ramesh Himmatlal Shah Vs. Harsukh Jadhavji Joshi AIR 1975\n\n \n SC 1470 and in particular paragraphs 17 and 18 in support of the submission that\n the flat in a tenant co-partnership housing society under the Maharashtra Co-\n\n operative \nSocieties Act\n is liable to attachment and sale in execution of the decree\n against the member who has been allotted flat by the society and is accordingly\n \n party aggrieved., Paragraphs 17 and 18 of \nthe said judgment\n read thus:\n\n 17. From a review of the foregoing provisions the position\n with reference to the particular Society is as follows:\n\n There is no absolute prohibition in the Act or in the Rules or in\n the Bye-laws prohibiting transfer of interest of a member in the\n \n\n property belonging to the Society. The only transfer which is\n void under the Act is one made in contravention of Sub-section\n \n\n (2) of \nSection 47\n [see \nSection 47(3)\n]. We have not been able to\n find any other provision anywhere to the same effect. In the\n scheme of the provisions a dichotomy is seen between share or\n interest in the capital and interest in property of the Society.\n\n While \nSection 29(2)\n refers to transfer of a member's share or\n his interest in the capital or property of any society, \nSection 31\n\n in contrast speaks of \"the share or interest of a member in the\n capital of a society\". \nThe Act\n, therefore, makes a clear\n distinction between the share or interest in the capital and\n\n share or interest in property of the Society. We have also\n noticed that the Act does recognise interest in the immovable\n property of the Society as well [see \nSection 47(1)(b)\n]. We have\n seen the qualifications for membership. There is no reason to\n suppose that if the qualifications under the Bye-laws are\n fulfilled an application\" for membership may be rejected. It is\n admitted that the flat is owned by the Society and the\n judgment-debtor has a right or interest to occupy the same.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 9/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n 18. This right or interest to occupy is a species of property. We\n have to consider whether this right to the particular property is\n\n \n attachable and saleable in execution of the decree against the\n judgment-debtor. It is contended by Mr. Chatterjee, amicus\n\n \n curiae, that \nSection 31\n of the Act completely bars attachment\n and sale of the said property in execution of the decree. We\n have already pointed out the difference in language between\n \nSection 29\n and \nSection 31\n and also made reference to \nSection\n\n \n 47(1)(b)\n in that connection. There is nothing in the language of\n \nSection 31\n to indicate that the right to occupation which is the\n right to be sold in auction is not attachable in execution of the\n decree. There is nothing in \nSection 31\n to even remotely\n\n \n include a prohibition against attachment or sale of the\n aforesaid right to occupation of the flat. Once \nSection 31\n is out\n \n of the way, we are left with \nSection 29\n wherein we do not find\n even a provision of prior consent for transfer of share or\n interest in such property. The only restrictions under \nSection\n \n 29(2)\n are that the member may not transfer his interest in the\n property prior to one year and the transfer is made to an\n existing member of the Society or to a person whose\n application for membership has been accepted by the Society.\n It is true that bye-law 71D says that a member to whom a\n \n\n tenement is allotted shall not assign or underlet, vacate or part\n \n\n with the possession of the tenement or any part thereof without\n the previous consent in writing of the Managing Committee,\n but there is nothing to show that contravention of this bye-law\n makes the assignment void under the Act unlike in the case of\n\n a transfer being void under \nSection 47(3)\n. There is no\n impediment to ratification of the assignment by the Committee\n particularly in view of the legal position arising out of the\n conjoint effect of \nSection 29\n, Rule 24 and bye-law 9. \nSection\n 29\n read with Rule 24 shows that there is no prohibition as such\n\n against transfer of a share to a member or even to a non-\n member if he consents to be a member and makes an\n application for membership by purchasing aye shares as\n provided under bye-law 9. Reading the aforesaid provisions\n there is no reason to think that there is any question of refusal\n of membership of the Society to a non-member if he is\n qualified otherwise and makes an appropriate application in\n which case the transfer of shares will be operative and thus the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 10/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n assignment of the right to occupation will hold good. Further it\n is significant that under \nSection 146(a)\n of the Act,\n\n \n contravention of Sub-section (2) of \nSection 47\n is punishable\n under \nSection 147\n of the Act. Contravention of any bye-law is,\n\n \n however, no offence. We, therefore, unhesitatingly come to the\n conclusion that this species of property, namely the right to\n occupy a flat of this type, assumes significant importance and\n acquires under the law a stamp of transferability in furtherance\n\n \n of the interest of commerce. We have seen no fetter under any\n of the legal provisions against such a conclusion. The\n attachment and the sale of the property in this case in\n execution of the decree are valid under the law.\n\n 10. Mr. Thacker learned senior counsel also placed reliance on the judgment of\n \n Delhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar And Ors. Vs., Lf. Governor of Delhi\n and another AIR 1983 Delhi 301 and in particular paragraph 17 to 21, 25 to 27 in\n \n support of the submission that even minority members of the society can challenge\n an arbitral award. Paragraphs 17 to 21 and 25 to 27 of the said judgment read\n thus :\n\n 17. In the case of Co-operative Society, the liability of a\n \n\n member may be limited or it may be unlimited. If there is a\n limited liability, then the Society will use the words 'limited' or\n its equivalent as part of its name. It so happens that in the\n instant case, the liability of the members is limited' as it uses\n\n the word 'limited' as part of its name. All this is provided in\n various sections of the \nDelhi Co-operative Societies Act, 1972\n,\n Even when the liability is limited, any claim against the\n Society can be recovered from the property of the Society as\n well as from the members of the Society to the extent of their\n\n liability. This is so provided in\n S. 75\n of the Act Even if no\n personal liability is involved, it is obvious that each member of\n the Society has an interest in the Society and as each member\n can have only one share, all the members share the interest\n equally. If the interests of the Society are adversely affected,\n the value of the share of each member to that extent is\n diminished. So, it cannot be denied that each member has an\n interest in the Society. One of the items in the award is that a\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 11/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n sum of Rupees 22,45,742/- has to be paid to the\n Administration. There is also another item to the effect that the\n\n \n Society shall not contest the smooth acquisitions of its land\n and shall not appeal for enhancement of its compensation.\n\n These two items are sufficient to show that the interest of the\n members is adversely affected to some extent, though it is\n difficult to see the exact implications of the award.\n\n 18. It appears that on this ground the members of the\n Society can maintain objections if the Society itself does not\n file the same.\n\n 19. There is yet another reason to come to the conclusion that\n the objection could be maintained. From an analysis of the\n \n facts set out earlier in the judgment, it plainly appears that the\n Managing Committee was superseded on 9th July, 1971. The\n application moved in this Court under S. 14 of the Arbitration\n \n Act was moved by Shri Bal Mokand Vig who was the ex-\n\n Secretary of the Society. \nS. 14 (2)\n of the Act provides that the\n arbitrators or umpire may file the award at the request of the\n parties or under directions by the Court. Obviously, for the\n \n\n purpose of that application, a member of the Society was\n treated as being competent to obtain an order from the Court to\n \n\n direct the filing of the award. If we come to the conclusion that\n no objections could be filed, then it would also have to be held\n that the award has been wrongly filed in the Court because it\n was at the instance of a party not entitled to maintain the\n\n application. We do not think that this is the correct view. The\n exact language used in\n S. 14 (2)\n is as follows:\n\n \" The arbitrators or umpire shall, at the request of any party\n to the arbitration agreement or any person claiming under\n such Party or if so directed by the Court cause the award or\n\n a signed copy to be filed in the Court.\"\n\n This shows that a person claiming under a party to the\n arbitration agreement has also a right. If this right exists under\n \nS. 14 (2)\n, it would appear that that party can also move the\n Court and consequently can also file the objections. All the\n members of the Society can be deemed to be persons claiming\n under the Society and, therefore, they are entitled to get the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 12/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n award filed in the Court and must also have the right to\n maintain the objections, otherwise, there was no point in\n\n \n giving the right to a person claiming under a party to move the\n arbitrator or the Court, as seems to be implicit in the language\n\n \n of\n S. 14 (2)\n. For this reason also it seems the objections could\n be maintained by the members.\n\n 20. It is now necessary to turn to perhaps the most important\n\n \n aspect of this case, which is regarding the rights of individual\n members of a Corporation to maintain a suit in the name of the\n Corporation or in the interest of the Corporation, since it is the\n analogy of a Corporation that has been applied here to a Co-\n\n operative Society as well. This matter was considered by the\n Federal Court in Dr. Satya Charan Lal v. Rameshwar Prosad\n \n Bajoria, . It was stated in that judgment that it was well-settled\n that in order to redress a wrong done to a company or to\n recover monies or damages alleged to be due to the company,\n \n the action should be brought by the company itself. This was\n the rule in Foss v. Harbottle, . It is unnecessary to refer to the\n other cases cited by the Federal Court. The law was\n summarised in the following terms:-\n\n \" The correct position seems to us to be that ordinarily the\n directors of a company are the only persons who can\n \n\n conduct litigation in the name of the company, but when\n they are themselves the wrong-doers against the company\n and have acted mala fide or beyond their powers, and their\n personal interest is in conflict with their duty in such a way\n\n that they cannot or will not take steps to seek redress for the\n wrong done to the company, the majority of the\n shareholders must in such a case be entitled to take steps to\n redress the wrong.\"\n\n This view upheld the right to the majority of share-holders to\n maintain an action in the name of the company. The law has\n been summarised in this behalf in Para No. 767 of Halsbury's\n Laws of England, Fourth Edition Vol. 7 as follows:\n\n \" In an action to redress a wrong done to a company or to\n recover money or damages alleged to be due to it, the\n company is the only proper plaintiff, but its name should be\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 13/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n used as plaintiff by direction of the company or its\n directors. Where the members complaining represent the\n\n \n majority of the company, the action may be brought in the\n company's name, ever though the directors object. The\n\n \n court may allow the matter to stand so that a company\n meeting can be held to decide whether the action should\n proceed in the company's name. At such a meeting the votes\n of the persons complained of cannot be excluded.\n\n Nevertheless, proceedings may be brought by any member\n or members in his or their own name or names where such\n authority cannot be obtained and the act complained of is of\n a fraudulent character or oppressive or is ultra vires the\n\n \n company, or criminal or where the wrongdoers control the\n majority of votes; or where the result would otherwise be\n \n that the company was carrying out by an ordinary\n resolution something which could only be properly carried\n out by a special resolution, or by any other resolution\n \n requiring a prescribed majority.\"\n\n Thus, the position as far as the latest Edition of Halsbury's\n Laws of England is concerned is that the action may be\n brought without the directors consent by a majority of\n \n\n shareholders in the name of the company and in some cases\n \n\n where the majority does not support the litigation by the\n shareholders in their representatives capacity. In such a case,\n the suit may be either by all the complaining members\n altogether or representatively by some of them. There is no\n\n case in which the minority of shareholders cannot protect their\n interest.\n\n 21. Keeping this in view, it does not seem right to hold that the\n members of the Society who have filed objections cannot\n\n maintain the objections. These objections have been filed in\n the individual names of the members and now, they are\n supported by the present management of the Society. No\n meeting was called by the Court because it was not a case of\n objections being filed in the name of the CO-operative Society.\n\n 25. Applying the above principle to the case of the present\n objector, on the footing that they are a minority set of\n shareholders in the Co-operative Society, it would appear that\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 14/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n some remedy should be open to them in respect of the\n Society's failure to object to the award. For the purpose of this\n\n \n analysis, it must be assumed that there is something wrong\n with the award, if this is so, it would be for the Society to\n\n \n challenge the same in normal circumstances. If the persons in\n charge of the management refuse to challenge the award, then\n it should be open to the minority shareholders to maintain a\n suit in respect of the award. However. \nS. 32\n of the Arbitration\n\n \n Act states that no suit can lie on any ground whatsoever for a\n decision upon the existence, effect or validity to arbitration\n agreement or award. So, these 143 members could not\n maintain a suit, on the principles laid down by the Supreme\n\n \n Court in Jawahar Lal Barman v. Union of India,\n MANU/SC/0005/1961 : AIR 1962 SC 378. This means that\n \n they can only approach The Court under the \nArbitration Act\n.\n This is, therefore, an additional ground on which the\n objections could be heard by the Court.\n\n 26. To summarise the conclusions, it may be useful to state the\n following propositions:-\n\n (1) In the case of Corporations, where there are members, a\n \n\n suit may be maintained by the Corporation acting through its\n directors. If the directors refuse to act or the action complained\n \n\n of is that of the directors themselves, then such a suit can be\n maintained by the majority shareholders in the name of the\n Corporation.\n\n (2) If the action is challenged by the minority shareholders\n when the directors refuse to act, then the action or suit has to\n be brought by the minority shareholders in their own name.\n\n This may be done by them acting jointly or there may be a\n representative suit by a class of shareholders or members.\n\n (3) In the case of an arbitration award which is filed in Court,\n the objections may be filed by the parties thereto or if the\n parties refuse to file objections or fail to file objections, then a\n person claiming under them can also file objections provided\n they can show some interest in the subject-matter of the award\n or reference, as the case may be.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 15/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n (4) The principle which applies to appeals, namely, that third\n parties can also file objections, even though not parties to the\n\n \n suit, applies also to objections against an award being made a\n rule of the Court subject to the same limitations, i.e., the\n\n \n objectors must show that they have an interest in the subject-\n matter of award or reference and they obtain leave of the Court\n which should normally not be refused.\n\n (5) In the case of arbitration awards against a Corporation\n which have been filed in the Court, members of the\n Corporation can maintain objections as they are debarred from\n filing a suit because of\n S. 32\n of the Arbitration Act, to\n\n \n challenge the award or the arbitration agreement, as the case\n may be. These objections can be filed on the same basis as a\n \n suit can be filed by majority or minority shareholders of a\n company, which means that if the majority shareholders object\n to the award they can do so in the name of the company and if\n \n the minority shareholders challenge the same, they can do so\n in their own names,\n\n (6) In order to determine whether it is the majority or minority\n shareholders who are maintaining the objections, the Court can\n \n\n even call a meeting of the company.\n\n 27. Applying these propositions to the circumstances of this\n case, it clearly appears that the nominated management of the\n Society was not willing to file objections to the award. The\n award was filed at the instance of one of the members of the\n\n Co-operative Society and not at the instance of the parties to\n the reference. Against this award, objections could be filed by\n the majority of the members in the name of the Co-operative\n Society or by a minority in their own names. If the objectors\n\n could establish an interest in the subject-matter of the award,\n they were entitled to get the leave of the Court to maintain the\n objections or they could be treated as persons claiming under a\n party and, therefore, entitled to maintain objections.\n Alternatively, they could maintain these subjections on the\n principles on which minority shareholders could challenge the\n decision of the majority. For all these reasons, we think the\n objections in this case were maintainable and we could allow\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 16/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n the present appeal.\n\n 11. Mr. Samdani learned senior counsel in rejoinder invited my attention to the\n\n \n judgment of Madras High Court in case of Chennai Container Terminal Pvt.\n Ltd.etc. Vs. Union of India and Ors. reported in AIR 2007 Madras 225 (DB) and\n submits that Division Bench of Madras High Court has considered the judgment of\n\n \n Delhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar and Ors. (supra) relied upon by\n Mr.Thacker learned senior counsel and has also considered the provisions of\n\n \n \nSection 34\n read with \nsection 2(1)(h)\n of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and\n has distinguished the judgment of learned Delhi Court on the ground that the\n \n provisions for impugning award under \nsection 30\n read with 33 of the \nArbitration\n Act, 1940\n which were considered by the Delhi High Court and \nsection 34\n of the\n \n Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are totally different. It is submitted that the\n principles laid down by Madras High Court in which the court had considered the\n provisions under \nsection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 read\n \n\n with \nsection 2(1)(h)\n which are squarely applicable to the facts of this case and\n \n\n shall be considered by this court and not the judgment of Delhi High Court.\n Paragraph 9 to 11 of the said judgment of Madras High Court read thus :-\n\n 9. However, in the case on hand the learned single Judge\n has held that though \nSection 34\n of the Act contemplates\n challenge of the award made by the party to the arbitration\n agreement, in view of \nSection 2(1)(h)\n of the Act, the import of\n the word 'party' can be judiciously expanded, if the context so\n\n warrants. Hence, the word 'party' may include not only the\n signatory to the arbitration agreement, but also a party non-\n\n signatory to the agreement. According to the learned single\n Judge, the contextual facts and circumstances warrant\n expansion of the definition found under \nSection 2(1)(h)\n of the\n Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 to include the\n Government of India, which is a party non-signatory for the\n purpose of challenging the award under \nSection 34\n of the Act.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 17/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n We fail to appreciate the stand taken by UOI that it is a non-\n signatory party to the agreement. Learned ASG was unable to\n\n \n show as to how UOI can be said to be a party to the agreement\n in the face of express provision contained in the agreement,\n\n \n which defined party to include only \"ChPT & CCTPL\". The\n word 'Party' is defined in \nSection 2(1)(h)\n of the Act to mean a\n \"party to an arbitration agreement\" and therefore, ordinarily,\n the expression 'Party' as used in \nSection 34\n of the Act must\n\n \n carry the same meaning, namely, a party to the arbitration\n agreement or award. But, as the opening part of \nSection 2(1)\n\n (h) of the Act shows, the definitional meaning is subject to\n anything repugnant in the subject or context. We must,\n\n \n therefore, see whether there is anything in \nSection 34\n or in the\n context in which it occurs which should compel us to place a\n \n broader meaning different from the one given to it in \nSection\n 2(1)(h)\n. In our opinion, there is nothing in the subject or\n context of \nSection 34\n which would suggest us to depart from\n \n the definitional meaning of the expression 'party'. The\n expression 'party' is used in \nSection 34(2)\n in its definitional\n sense to mean a party to the arbitration proceedings and does\n not include a third person, who is not a party to the agreement.\n To our mind the interpretation suggested by the learned ASG\n \n\n would make the Act totally unworkable. It is well settled that\n \n\n an award is final and binding only on the parties and can be\n enforced only against the party to the award. A third party\n would therefore be in a position to challenge the award, but\n not be bound by it, if the challenge fails. Equally, a third party\n\n can render the limitation period envisaged under the Act otiose\n by merely claiming knowledge of the award long after the\n period of limitation has expired.\n\n 10. Learned ASG, however, submitted that UOI is an\n\n aggrieved party inasmuch as the arbitrator has totally\n misconstrued the guidelines of UOI and therefore, the UOI can\n challenge the award of the arbitrator. In support of his\n submission, learned ASG placed reliance on the Division\n Bench judgment of the Delhi High Court in Sohan Nayyar v.\n Lt. Governor, Delhi MANU/DE/0483/1982 : AIR 1983 Delhi\n\n \n301. The said decision is under the old \nArbitration Act\n of 1940\n and the Bench clearly found that the provisions of the Act of\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 18/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n 1940 do not specify as to which can make an application, and\n therefore held that as the Act does not prohibit filing of an\n\n \n objection by a third parties, there is no bar to some one else\n filing objections provided they have some interest in the\n\n \n subject matter of the litigation. As observed by the Supreme\n Court in \nSundaram Finance Limited v. NEPC Limited\n , the\n \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n is based on\n UNCITRAL Model. It is entirely different from the \nArbitration\n\n \n Act, 1940\n. The provisions of this Act must, therefore, be\n interpreted and construed independently and in fact reference\n to 1940 Act may actually lead to misconstruction. In order to\n get help in construing these provisions it is more relevant to\n\n \n refer to the UNCITRAL Model Law rather than the 1940 Act.\n\n 11. Learned ASG, relying upon the decision of the Supreme\n Court in ITI Ltd v. Siemens Public Communications Network\n Ltd. MANU/SC/0502/2002 : [2002]3SCR1122 submitted that\n \n the provisions \nof CPC\n would apply to the proceedings under\n \nSection 34\n of the Act and an aggrieved party for the purpose of\n challenging the award can invoke \nSection 34\n of the Act. The\n contention is required to be stated only for rejection. In ITI\n \n\n Ltd. Case the Court held that merely because second appeal is\n barred under Sub-section (3) of \nSection 37\n, remedy of revision\n \n\n would not cease to be available. Although revision is not\n specifically provided for by the Act but in the absence of any\n express exclusion \nof CPC\n, no inference can be drawn that\n\n provisions \nof CPC\n would not apply to proceedings arising\n under the Act and revision is not maintainable. This decision\n has no application to the case on hand. \nSection 34\n of the Act\n read with the definition of 'party' in \nSection 2(1)(h)\n of the Act\n makes it amply clear that only a party to the arbitration\n\n agreement can invoke the provisions of \nSection 34\n of the Act.\n A third party has no locus standi to challenge the award under\n \nSection 34\n of the Act.\n\n REASONS AND CONCLUSION\n\n 12. \nSection 34\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 provides for an\n application for setting aside arbitral award. \nSection 34(2)\n provides for the grounds\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 19/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n of challenge of an arbitral award on which such award may be set aside by the\n\n \n court. The said provision also provides that an arbitral award may be set aside if\n the party making application furnishes any of the proof that is specifically setout in\n\n \n \nsection 34(2) (a) (i)\n to (v). Under \nsection 2(1) (h)\n party is defined as 'party' means\n a party to an arbitration agreement.\n\n 13. A perusal of the record clearly indicates that none of the members of the\n society were parties to the development agreement entered into between the\n\n \n respondent no.1 and the society. It is however the case of the petitioners that since\n the society did not challenge the impugned award and the said award has affected\n \n the rights of the petitioners in respect of their respective flats in the society,\n petitioners who are claiming through the society are also thus parties to the\n \n arbitration agreement and being parties aggrieved are entitled to challenge the\n impugned award though the society has not impugned the said arbitral award.\n\n 14. A perusal of the \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n in toto shows that the\n \n\n term party has been used in almost every section of the said Act. Under \nsection 7\n\n of the said Act the parties by an agreement can submit to arbitration all or certain\n\n disputes which have arisen or may arise between them in respect of a defined legal\n relationship whether contractual or not. It is provided that an arbitration agreement\n shall be in writing. \nSection 7(4)\n of the Act provides as to when an arbitration\n agreement can be construed as in writing if it is contained in various documents\n\n and pleadings.\n\n 15. \nSection 8\n provides that a party to an arbitration agreement can file an\n application before a judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter\n which is the subject of an arbitration agreement, to refer parties to arbitration.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 20/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n \nSection 9\n of the Act provides for interim measures which can be applied by a party.\n\n \nSection 10\n provides for composition of arbitral tribunal which can be determined\n by the parties to the arbitration agreement. \nSection 11\n of the Act provides for\n\n \n appointment of arbitrators in the mode and manner prescribed therein and\n prescribes for an application to be made by a party to the arbitration agreement for\n appointment of arbitrators before the Chief Justice or any person or institution\n\n \n designated by him.\n\n 16. \nSections 12\n and \n13\n of the Act provides for grounds for challenge which\n challenge can be made only by the parties to the arbitration agreement. Under\n \n \nsection 14\n of the Act, the parties to the arbitration agreement can apply to the court\n to decide on the termination of the mandate if a controversy remains concerning\n \n any of the grounds referred to in clause (a) of sub-\nsection 1\n of \nsection 14\n. \nSection\n 15\n of the Act provides for termination of mandate and for making an application by\n the parties to the arbitration for substitution of arbitrator. \nSection 17\n of the Act\n \n\n permits parties to the arbitration agreement to apply for interim measures before\n \n\n the arbitral tribunal. \nSection 18\n of the Act provides that the parties shall be treated\n with equality and each party shall be given a full opportunity to present his case.\n\n 17. \nSection 19\n provides for determination of rules of procedure and further\n provides that subject to the said part, the parties are free to agree on the procedure\n to be followed by the arbitral tribunal in conducting its proceedings. \nSection 20\n\n provides for an agreement between the parties to the arbitration agreement to agree\n on the place of arbitration. \nSection 21\n provides as to when the arbitral proceedings\n commences unless otherwise agreed by the parties. \nSection 22\n to \n26\n of the Act\n provides for the mode and manner of conducting arbitration proceedings by the\n parties before the arbitral tribunal and consequence of a default of a party.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 21/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n 18. \nSection 28\n of the Act provides that what rules shall be applicable to\n\n \n substance of dispute. The arbitral tribunal has to decide in accordance with the\n terms of the contract entered into between the parties. Under \nsection 31\n, the\n\n \n arbitral tribunal has to render reasons in the arbitral award unless the parties have\n agreed that no reasons are to be given. It provides that a signed copy of the arbitral\n award has to be delivered or shall be delivered to each party. The arbitral tribunal\n\n \n is empowered to grant interest unless the parties have otherwise agreed that interest\n not to be awarded by the arbitral tribunal. Under \nsection 32\n of the Act the arbitral\n\n \n proceedings are terminated if the parties agree on the termination of the\n proceedings. Under \nsection 33\n, a party may apply for correction, interpretation and\n \n for additional award. Under \nsection 34\n of the Act, a party can challenge an arbitral\n award on the grounds setout therein.\n\n 19. A perusal of the aforesaid provisions of the Act and the scheme makes it\n clear that only the parties to the arbitration agreement can exercise various rights\n \n\n and invoke the mechanism of adjudication of disputes by arbitration by referring\n \n\n their disputes to arbitration for adjudication and not by an outsider. The only\n exception carved out under the Act is under \nsections 40\n and \n41\n i.e. in case of the\n\n death of a party to the arbitration agreement which can be enforceable by or\n against the legal representative of the deceased and in case of insolvency, if such\n insolvant was party to arbitration agreement and if official assignee or receiver\n adopts such contract.\n\n 20. In my view the arbitral tribunal is a private forum and gets jurisdiction to\n adjudicate upon the disputes between the parties to the arbitration agreement and\n not the persons who are not parties to the arbitration agreement. Proceedings under\n \nsection 34\n of the Act are not by way of an appeal. There is no other provision\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 22/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n under the Act for challenge of an arbitral award except what is provided under\n\n \n \nsection 34\n of the Act. In my view only a party to the arbitration agreement which\n is defined under \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the Act can challenge an arbitral award under\n\n \n \nsection 34\n of the Act and not by a person who is not a party to the arbitration\n agreement unless covered by \nsections 40\n and \n41\n of the Act. However if a person\n is wrongly impleaded as party to the arbitration proceedings and is aggrieved by\n\n \n arbitral award, he can invoke \nsection 34\n of the Act.\n\n \n21. Division Bench of this court in case of \nGirish Mulchand Mehta and\n another\n (supra) has held that a member of the society speaks through the society\n \n and has no independent right qua the society. Society is entitled to represent as the\n corporate aggregate.\n \nDivision bench of this court has considered the judgment of\n \n Supreme Court in case of \nRamesh Himmatlal Shah\n (supra) which is relied upon\n by Mr.Thacker, learned senior counsel for the petitioners and held that the\n members of the society not having challenged the resolution passed by the society\n \n\n and such resolution not having been set side by the appropriate forum are binding\n \n\n on all the members.\n\n \n22. Supreme court in case of \nFirm Ashok Traders vs. Gurmukhdas Saluja and\n others\n AIR 2004 SC 1433 while construing \nsection 9\n of the Act held that a person\n not a party to an arbitration agreement cannot enter the court for protection under\n \nsection 9\n of the Act. A party to an arbitration agreement can invoke the said\n\n jurisdiction for securing relief which the court has power to grant before, during or\n after arbitral proceeding by virtue of \nsection 9\n. The court is competent to grant\n such relief to a party under clauses (i) and (ii) of \nsection 9\n. In my view the\n principles \nlaid down by\n the Supreme Court while interpreting \nsection 9\n of the Act\n which provides for a remedy of interim measures available only to a party to\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 23/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n arbitration agreement are applicable also to the proceedings under \nsection 34\n of the\n\n \n Act for setting aside an award only by a party to an arbitration agreement subject to\n \nsections 40\n and \n41\n of the Act and by a person wrongly impleaded as party to\n\n \n arbitration proceedings and is aggrieved by such arbitral award.\n\n \n23. Supreme court in case of The state of \nMaharashtra & Ors. vs. Ark Builders\n\n \n Pvt. Ltd.\n AIR 2011 SC 1374 while interpreting \nsection 31 (5)\n of the Act has held\n that copy of an arbitral award has to be delivered to the party by the arbitral\n\n \n tribunal and the limitation for making an application for correction or interpretation\n of award under \nsection 33(1)\n and for making an application for setting aside an\n \n award under \nsection 34(3)\n commences from the date of delivery of such arbitral\n award by the arbitral tribunal to a party to the arbitration agreement. Paragraph 12\n \n of \nthe said judgment\n reads thus:-\n\n \n12. We are supported in our view by the decision of this Court\n \n\n in \nUnion of India v. Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors\n MANU/SC/0214/2005\n : (2005) 4 SCC 239; in paragraph 8 of\n \n\n the decision it was held and observed as follows:\n\n 8. The delivery of an arbitral award under Sub-section (5)\n of \nSection 31\n is not a matter of mere formality. It is a matter\n of substance. It is only after the stage under \nSection 31\n has\n\n passed that the stage of termination of arbitral proceedings\n within the meaning of \nSection 32\n of the Act arises. The\n delivery of arbitral award to the party, to be effective, has to\n be \"received\" by the party. This delivery by the Arbitral\n Tribunal and receipt by the party of the award sets in\n\n motion several periods of limitation such as an\n application for correction and interpretation of an award\n within 30 days under \nSection 33(1)\n, an application for\n making an additional award under \nSection 33(4)\n and an\n application for setting aside an award under \nSection\n 34(3)\n and so on. As this delivery of the copy of award has\n the effect of conferring certain rights on the party as also\n bringing to an end the right to exercise those rights on\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 24/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n expiry of the prescribed period of limitation which would\n be calculated from that date, the delivery of the copy of\n\n \n award by the Tribunal and the receipt thereof by each party\n constitutes an important stage in the arbitral proceedings.\n\n (Emphasis added)\n\n \n24. Supreme Court in case of \nBenarsi Krishna Committee & Ors. vs. Karmyogi\n\n \n Shelters Pvt. Ltd.\n (2012) 9 SCC 496 has held that copy of the award has to be\n delivered to the party as defined in \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the Act which clearly\n indicates that such a person shall be a party to the arbitration agreement. A copy of\n\n \n the award can be served only on the party himself and not his or her agent or\n \n advocate. Paragraph 15 of \nthe said judgment\n of the Supreme Court read thus :-\n\n \n15. Having taken note of the submissions advanced on behalf\n \n of the respective parties and having particular regard to the\n expression \"party\" as defined in \nSection 2(h)\n of the 1996 Act\n read with the provisions of \nSections 31(5)\n and \n34(3)\n of the\n 1996 Act, we are not inclined to interfere with the decision of\n \n\n the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court impugned in these\n proceedings. The expression \"party\" has been amply dealt with\n \n\n in \nTecco Trechy Engineer\n's case (supra) and also in \nARK\n Builders Pvt. Ltd.\n's case (supra), referred to hereinabove. It is\n one thing for an Advocate to act and plead on behalf of a party\n in a proceeding and it is another for an Advocate to act as the\n\n party himself. The expression \"party\", as defined in \nSection\n 2(h)\n of the 1996 Act, clearly indicates a person who is a party\n to an arbitration agreement. The said definition is not qualified\n in any way so as to include the agent of the party to such\n\n agreement. Any reference, therefore, made in \nSection 31(5)\n\n and \nSection 34(2)\n of the 1996 Act can only mean the party\n himself and not his or her agent, or Advocate empowered to\n act on the basis of a Vakalatnama. In such circumstances,\n proper compliance with \nSection 31(5)\n would mean delivery of\n a signed copy of the Arbitral Award on the party himself and\n not on his Advocate, which gives the party concerned the right\n to proceed Under \nSection 34(3)\n of the aforesaid Act.\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 25/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n \n25.

An\n arbitrator can be appointed under the said Act at the instance of a party to an\n\n \n arbitration agreement only in respect of the disputes with another party to the\n arbitration agreement. If there is a dispute between a party to an arbitration\n\n \n agreement with other parties to the arbitration agreement as also non-parties to the\n arbitration agreement, reference to arbitration or appointment of arbitrator can be\n \n only with respect to the parties to the arbitration agreement and not the non-parties.\n It is held that since there was no arbitration agreement between the parties, the\n \n impleadment of the person not party to arbitration agreement as a respondent in the\n arbitration proceedings and the award against such person in such arbitration can\n not be sustained. Paragraphs 5, 7 and 19 of \nthe said judgment\n read thus :-\n\n 5. The High Court of Delhi by two orders dated 23.5.2000\n appointed a retired Judge of the High Court as the sole\n arbitrator.

The first award directed respondents 2 and 3 and\n\n appellant to pay Rs. 93,23,288/- (that is Rs. 50 lakhs with\n interest at 20; up to the date of the appointment of arbitrator)\n with interest at 18% per annum from 24.5.2000. Similarly the\n second award directed respondents 2 and 3 and appellant to\n pay Rs. 46,49,315/- (that is Rs. 25 lakhs with interest at 20%\n\n upto the date of appointment of arbitrator) with interest at 18%\n per annum from 24.5.2000. The two arbitration awards were\n challenged by the appellant by filing applications under\n \nSection 34\n of the Act (OMP No. 319/2002 and 322/2002). The\n second and third respondents also challenged the awards in\n OMP No. 320/2002 and 321/2002. A learned single Judge of\n the Delhi High Court by a common order dated 22.5.2006\n dismissed the said applications. The said common order dated\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 26/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n 22.5.2006, insofar as it dismisses OMP 319/2002 and\n 322/2002, is challenged by the appellant in this appeals by\n\n \n special leave.\n\n 7. \nSection 2(b)\n defines \"arbitration agreement' as an agreement\n referred to in \nSection 7\n of the Act. \nSection 2(h)\n defines \"party\"\n\n as party to an arbitration agreement. \nSection 7\n of the Act\n defines an 'arbitration agreement'. Sub-section (1) of \nSection 7\n\n \n defines an arbitration agreement as an agreement by the parties\n to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have\n arisen or which may arise between them in respect of a defined\n legal relationship, whether contractual or not. Sub-section (2)\n\n \n provides that an arbitration agreement may be in the form of\n an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate\n \n agreement. Sub-section (3) requires an arbitration agreement to\n be in writing. Sub-section (4) explains as to when an\n arbitration agreement could be said to be in writing, that is: (a)\n \n a document signed by the parties; (b) an exchange of letters,\n telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which\n provide a record of the arbitration agreement; or (c) an\n exchange of statements of claim and defence in which the\n \n\n existence of the arbitration agreement is alleged by one party\n and not denied by the other. Sub-section (5) provides that the\n \n\n reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration\n clause constitutes an arbitration agreement if the contract is in\n writing and the reference is such as to make that arbitration\n clause a part of the contract. Thus there can be reference to\n\n arbitration only if there is an arbitration agreement between the\n parties. \nThe Act\n makes it clear that an Arbitrator can be\n appointed under the Act at the instance of a party to an\n arbitration agreement only in respect of disputes with another\n party to the arbitration agreement. If there is a dispute between\n\n a party to an arbitration agreement, with other parties to the\n arbitration agreement as also non-parties to the arbitration\n agreement, reference to arbitration or appointment of arbitrator\n can be only with respect to the parties to the arbitration\n agreement and not the non-parties.\n\n 19. As there was no arbitration agreement between the parties\n (the first respondent and appellant), the impleading of\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 27/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n appellant as a respondent in the arbitration proceedings and the\n award against the appellant in such arbitration cannot be\n\n \n sustained. As a consequence, both the arbitration awards, as\n against the appellant are liable to be set aside. If the first\n\n \n respondent wants to enforce the alleged guarantee of the\n appellant, it is open to the first respondent to do so in\n accordance with law.\n\n 26. In my view since the petitioners herein could not have been impleaded as\n parties to the arbitration proceedings before the learned arbitrator for want of\n arbitration agreement between the petitioners and the respondent no.1, nor the\n\n \n petitioners were parties to the arbitration proceedings, petitioners have no locus to\n \n file petition under \nsection 34\n of the Act for setting aside such an arbitral award.\n\n 27. This court in case of Supreme Megha Constructions LLP Vs.Symphony\n \n Co-operative Housing Society Limited and Mr.Ajay Wadhwa applicant in Notice\n of Motion (L) No.2410 of 2014 in Suit (L) No. 867 of 2014, delivered on 29 th\n October 2014 has held that since the applicant in the notice of motion who was\n \n\n member of the society was not party to the arbitration agreement cannot file an\n \n\n application under \nsection 8\n of the said Act for referring the parties to the suit to\n arbitration. This court has considered \nsection 8\n read with the definition of party\n\n under \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the said Act and has held that society was party to the\n arbitration agreement and not the applicant member and thus application under\n \nsection 8\n would not be maintainable at the instance of such member who was not\n party to the arbitration agreement. Paragraphs 23 and 24 of \nthe said judgment\n read\n\n thus :-\n\n 23. Perusal of the record indicates that except the plaintiff\n and the defendant no.1 society, none of the parties to this\n proceedings are party to development agreement. In my view\n since applicant and other defendants except the society are not\n parties to the arbitration agreement, even if application under\n \nsection 8\n would have been filed by the applicant to this Notice\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 28/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n of Motion or other defendants except the society, same would\n not have been maintainable. Application under \nsection 8\n can\n\n \n be filed only by a party to the arbitration agreement. \nSection 8\n\n has to be read with \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the Arbitration and\n\n \n Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n \n24. This court in case of \nVardhaman Developers Ltd. vs.\n Andheri Krupa Prasad Co-op.Hsg.Soc.Ltd\n. & Ors. in Notice\n\n \n of Motion (L) No. 248 of 2014 in Suit No.94 of 2014 in a\n judgment rendered on 20th February, 2014 has taken a view\n that the member of the society who was not party to the\n arbitration agreement cannot mention an application under\n\n \n \nsection 8\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. I am\n therefore of the view that even such application under \nsection\n \n 8\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act if would have been\n filed by a member claiming through the society which society\n is party to the arbitration agreement, such application would\n \n not be maintainable.\n\n 28. In my view the principles \nlaid down by\n this court in \nthe said judgment\n in the\n case of Supreme Megha Constructions LLP (supra) would be applicable to the\n \n\n application made by the petitioners under \nsection 34\n of the said Act. I am therefore\n \n\n of the view that this petition is not maintainable at the instance of the petitioners.\n\n 29. In so far as judgment of Delhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar and\n\n others (supra) relied upon by Mr.Thacker, learned senior counsel is concerned, a\n perusal of the said judgment clearly indicates that the said judgment was delivered\n in the proceedings governed by the provisions of \nArbitration Act\n 1940. \nIn case of\n\n \nChennai Container Terminal Pvt. Ltd.\n (supra) Division Bench of Madras High\n court has dealt with the proceedings under the provisions of the \nArbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996\n. Question of law considered by the Madras High Court was\n whether the applicant who was neither a party to the arbitration agreement nor to\n the arbitration proceedings could file an application under \nsection 34\n of the\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 29/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n Arbitration and Conciliation Act for setting aside the arbitral award. The Madras\n\n \n High Court has held that there is nothing in the subject or context of \nsection 34\n\n which would suggest the court to depart from the definitional meaning of the\n\n \n expression 'party' . It is held that the expression party is used in \nsection 34 (2)\n in\n its definitional sense to mean a party to the arbitration proceedings and does not\n include a third person who is not party to the agreement.\n\n 30. It is held that a third party can render the limitation period envisaged under\n\n \n the Act otiose by merely claiming knowledge of the award long after the period of\n limitation as expired. The Madras High Court in \nthe said judgment\n has\n \n distinguished the judgment of Delhi High Court in case of Sohan Nayyar (supra)\n by holding that the Delhi high Court had found that the provisions of the\n \n \nArbitration Act\n 1940 did not specify as to who can make an application and\n therefore held that as the said \nArbitration Act\n 1940 did not prohibit filing of an\n objection by a third party, there was no bar to someone else filing objections\n \n\n provided they had some interest in the subject matter of the litigation. The Madras\n \n\n High Court adverted to the judgment of Supreme Court in case of M/s.Sundaram\n Finance Limited vs. M/s.NEPC Limited 1999(2) SCC 499 holding that the\n\n \nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n 1996 is based on UNCITRAL Model and is\n entirely different from the \nArbitration Act\n 1940. The Supreme Court has held in\n the said judgment that the provisions of \nArbitration and Conciliation Act\n 1996\n must therefore be interpreted and construed independently and in fact reference to\n\n 1940 Act may actually lead to misconstruction.\n\n 31. A perusal of \nsection 30\n read with \nsection 33\n of the Arbitration Act, 1940\n makes it clear that an application to challenge the existence or validity of an\n arbitration agreement or an award or to have the effect of either determined could\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 30/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n be applied to the court by any party to the arbitration agreement or any person\n\n \n claiming under him. A perusal of the said Act makes it clear that the expression\n 'party to an arbitration agreement' has not been defined under the said \nArbitration\n\n \n Act\n 1940. A perusal of the provisions of \nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\n and in particular \nsection 34(2)\n makes it clear that an application for setting aside an\n award can be made only by the party which is defined under \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the\n\n \n said Act or by the party to the arbitration proceedings.\n\n 32. A perusal of \nsection 34\n of the Act makes it clear that the said application has\n\n \n to be filed within the time prescribed under \nsection 34(3)\n of the said Act. The time\n \n to file such application commences from the date of such party receiving copy of\n the arbitral award from the learned arbitrator. Under \nsection 31(5)\n of the Act the\n \n arbitral tribunal has to deliver a copy of the award to each party. It is thus clear\n that a party to the arbitration agreement who may be a party to the arbitration\n proceedings and/or all the parties to the arbitration proceedings only would be\n \n\n entitled to be furnished with a copy of the arbitral award by the learned arbitrator\n \n\n under \nsection 31(5)\n of the Act and upon delivery of copy of award from the\n arbitrator it which would commence the period of limitation for the purpose of\n filing an application under \nsection 34\n and can be filed within the time prescribed\n\n therein. If the arguments of the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners\n are accepted that the petitioners though were not parties to the arbitration\n agreement nor were parties to the arbitration proceedings can file an application for\n\n setting aside an award, there would be no limitation for filing an application for\n setting aside an arbitral award at the instance of such an outsider.\n\n 33. In my view the grounds of challenge which are available under \nsection 34\n of\n the Act and various other provisions which are applicable to the parties who are\n defined under \nsection 2(1) (h)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 cannot\n\n ::: Downloaded on - 08/12/2014 23:47:26 :::\n\n Kvm\n\n 31/31\n\n ARBP515.13\n\n be exercised by an outsider or by a person who is not a party to the arbitration\n\n \n agreement or the arbitration proceedings. In my view the petitioners who are\n members of the society which society was party to the arbitration agreement not\n\n \n having filed application for setting aside the impugned award cannot step into the\n shoes of the society and cannot be granted any leave to challenge the arbitral\n award. In my view there is no provision under the \nArbitration and Conciliation\n\n \n Act, 1996\n for granting any such leave as prayed by the petitioners to file an\n application under \nsection 34\n for setting aside the arbitral award.\n\n 34. In my view the petition filed by the petitioners who are neither parties to the\n \n arbitration agreement nor parties to the arbitration proceedings can not maintain\n this petition.\n\n 35. I therefore pass the following order :-\n\n (a) Arbitration Petition is dismissed as not maintainable.\n\n (b) No order as to costs.\n\n [R.D.
