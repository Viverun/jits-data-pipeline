Appeal No. 121 of 2010\n Reserved on: 4.4.2025\n Date of Decision: 30.05.2025\n\n Lalit Rana ...Appellant\n Versus\n State of H.P. ...Respondent\n\n Coram\n Hon'ble Mr Justice Rakesh Kainthla, Judge.\n\n Whether approved for reporting?1 No.\n For the Appellant : Mr. Bimal Gupta, Senior Advocate,\n with Ms. Simran, Advocate.\n\n For the Respondent : Mr. Ajit Sharma, Deputy Advocate\n General.\n\n Rakesh Kainthla, Judge\n\n The present appeal is directed against the judgment\n\n of conviction and order of sentence dated 30.4.2010, passed by\n\n learned Sessions Judge, Sirmour District at Nahan, H.P., (learned\n\n Trial Court), vide which the appellant (accused before learned\n\n Trial Court) was convicted of the commission of an offence\n\n punishable under \nSection 498-A\n of the Indian Penal Code (\nIPC\n)\n\n and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two\n\n years, pay fine of ₹3,000/- and in default of payment of fine to\n\n1\n\n Whether reporters of Local Papers may be allowed to see the judgment? Yes.\n\n 2\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nundergo further simple imprisonment for three months. (Parties\n\nshall hereinafter be referred to in the same manner as they were\n\narrayed before the learned Trial Court for convenience.)\n\n2. Briefly stated, the facts giving rise to the present\n\nappeal are that the police presented a challan against the accused\n\nbefore the learned Trial Court for the commission of offences\n\npunishable under \nSections 306\n and \n498-A\n of the IPC. It was\n\nasserted that the accused Lalit Rana informed the police on\n\n22.6.2008 that his wife had committed suicide by hanging\n\nherself. Vijay Sharma (PW12) went to the Regional Hospital,\n\nNahan, for verification of the information, where Veena Devi\n\n(PW1) made a statement (Ex.PW1/A) that earlier Lata Devi (since\n\ndeceased) was married to Naresh Kumar in the year 1987-88. She\n\nobtained a divorce in the year 1989 and married the accused in\n\nthe year 1993-94. She and the accused were residing together\n\nafter their marriage. Pooja (PW2), was born to Lata Devi. The\n\naccused had cordial relations with deceased Lata Devi for 4-5\n\nyears after his marriage, however, he started picking up quarrels\n\nwith her on trivial matters. She used to narrate all these facts to\n\nVeena Devi (PW1). Veena Devi counselled the accused, but he did\n\nnot heed her advice. Complaints were also made to Savitri Devi,\n\n 3\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nPradhan of Gram Panchayat Devka Pudla. She also counselled the\n\naccused, but the accused did not mend his ways. Lata Devi\n\ninformed Veena Devi one month before her death that the\n\naccused Lalit Rana had insulted her by pulling the drawstring of\n\nher salwar in the presence of labourers. Veena Devi talked to the\n\naccused, and he acknowledged his fault. He promised not to\n\nrepeat such acts. Lata Devi told these facts to her brother Kamal\n\nSingh. Lata Devi informed Veena Devi in the evening of 21.6.2008\n\nand morning of 22.6.2008 that Lalit Rana was harassing her. She\n\nrequested Veena Devi to visit her matrimonial home, however,\n\nVeena was ill and could not meet her. She received a call on\n\n22.6.2008, at about 7/7.30 that Lata Devi had committed suicide\n\nby hanging. Lata Devi had committed suicide because she was fed\n\nup with the behaviour of the accused. Statement (Ex.PW1/A) was\n\nsent to the Police Station, where FIR (Ex.PW7/A) was registered.\n\nVijay Kumar Deputy Superintendent of Police (PW12) conducted\n\nthe investigation of the case. He prepared the inquest report\n\n(Ex.PW12/A) and sent the dead body for postmortem\n\nexamination. Dr. Mahinder Kumar Sharma (PW9) conducted the\n\npostmortem examination of the dead body. He issued\n\npostmortem report (Ex.PW9/A), in which it was mentioned that\n\n 4\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nthe death was probably caused due to partial hanging leading to\n\nasphyxia. He preserved the viscera and handed it over to the\n\npolice official accompanying the dead body. Vijay Sharma,\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Police (PW12) visited the spot and\n\nprepared a site plan (Ex.PW2/B). Viscera was sent to FSL for\n\nchemical examination and as per the report (Ex.PW8/A), no\n\npoison was detected in the viscera. Statements of witnesses were\n\nrecorded as per their version. After the completion of the\n\ninvestigation, the challan was prepared and presented before the\n\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Nahan, who committed it to\n\nthe learned Sessions Judge for trial.\n\n3. Learned Trial Court charged the accused with the\n\ncommission of offences punishable under \nSections 498-A\n and\n\n306\n of IPC, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses to prove its\n\ncase. Veena Devi (PW1) is the informant and sister of the\n\ndeceased. Pooja (PW2) is the daughter of the deceased. Sirmour\n\nSingh (PW3) is the brother of the deceased. Satish Kumar (PW4)\n\ndid not support the prosecution's case. Kamlesh (PW5) is the\n\ncousin and Kanta Devi (PW11) is sister of the deceased. Krishan\n\nKumar (PW6) took the photographs. ASI Jagdish (PW7) signed\n\n 5\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nthe FIR. SI Subhash Chand (PW8) conducted the investigation\n\npartly. Dr. Mahender Kumar Sharma (PW9) conducted the\n\npostmortem examination of Lata. Som Dutt (PW10) proved that\n\nmarriage was solemnised between the accused and deceased Lata\n\nDevi. Dy.S.P. Vijay Sharma (PW11) conducted the investigation.\n\n5. The accused, in his statement recorded under \nSection\n\n313\n of Cr.P.C., admitted that he had called the police regarding\n\nthe death of his wife. He admitted that police conducted an\n\ninquest on the dead body. He stated that the deceased had not\n\nshown her willingness to go to the Tribhuvan Temple despite his\n\nrequests. She chose to live in her home. He stated that Lata was a\n\nshort-tempered lady. He had sacrificed a goat in the temple as\n\nper the custom. He distributed the goat meat to his relatives on\n\nthe way. Lata Devi questioned him why he had not brought the\n\nwhole goat meat with him. She misbehaved with him. He went to\n\nthe house of Dil Bahadur (DW1), where he was told that Lata Devi\n\nhad committed suicide by hanging herself. He went to the spot\n\nand also informed the police on the telephone. He was falsely\n\nimplicated in the present case. Statement of Dil Bahadur (DW1)\n\nwas recorded in defence.\n\n 6\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n6. Learned Trial Court held that the testimonies of\n\nprosecution witnesses corroborated each other. The fact that the\n\nprosecution had only cited related witnesses will not make the\n\nprosecution's case doubtful because only the relatives would\n\nhave known about the household affairs. The witnesses\n\nwithstood their cross-examination, and there was nothing to\n\ndoubt their testimonies. The statement of Dil Bahadur (DW1) was\n\nnot sufficient to discard the prosecution's case. The testimonies\n\nof the witnesses were consistent that the accused treated the\n\ndeceased with cruelty. He was counselled by the relatives of the\n\ndeceased, but he did not mend his behaviour. He had pulled the\n\ndrawstring of Lata Devi in the presence of the labourers. She was\n\ndisturbed by this act. The prosecution's evidence proved that the\n\naccused used to give beatings to the deceased, but there was no\n\nevidence that he intended her to commit suicide. Hence, the\n\nlearned Trial Court acquitted the accused of the commission of\n\nthe offence punishable under \nSection 306\n of IPC but convicted\n\nhim of the commission of the offence punishable under \nSection\n\n498-A\n of IPC and sentenced him as aforesaid.\n\n7. Being aggrieved from the judgment of conviction and\n\norder of sentence passed by the learned Trial Court, the accused\n\n 7\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nhas filed the present appeal, asserting that the learned Trial\n\nCourt erred in convicting and sentencing the accused. The\n\nprosecution's evidence was not sufficient to prove the cruelty of\n\nthe accused. There was a considerable delay in lodging the FIR,\n\nwhich made the prosecution's case highly suspect. There were\n\nvarious contradictions in the testimonies of eyewitnesses. Meena\n\nDevi said that Pooja told her about the harassment of the\n\ndeceased, but Pooja did not state any such fact, and this made the\n\nprosecution's case suspect. The testimonies of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses had major contradictions, which adversely affected the\n\nprosecution's case. The informant failed to prove various\n\nallegations levelled by her in her complaint. Prosecution\n\nwitnesses had sufficient time to connive with each other to\n\nfalsely implicate the accused. The investigation is defective, and\n\nthe defence evidence proved on the balance of probability that\n\nthe accused was not even present in the home when the deceased\n\nhad committed suicide. As per the prosecution's case, the\n\naccused pulled the drawstring of Lata Devi in the presence of the\n\nlabourers, however, the labourers were not produced before the\n\nCourt. All the incriminating circumstances were not put to the\n\naccused. Therefore, it was prayed that the present appeal be\n\n 8\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nallowed and the judgment passed by the learned Trial Court be\n\nset aside.\n\n8. I have heard Mr. Bimal Gupta, learned Senior counsel\n\nassisted by Ms. Simran, learned counsel for the\n\nappellant/accused, and Mr. Ajit Sharma, learned Deputy\n\nAdvocate General, for the respondent-State.\n\n9. Mr. Bimal Gupta, learned Senior counsel for the\n\nappellant/accused, submitted that the learned Trial Court erred\n\nin convicting and sentencing the accused. There were various\n\ncontradictions in the testimonies of the eyewitnesses. The\n\nincident occurred on 22.6.2008, whereas the matter was reported\n\nto the police on 23.6.2008. The delay in reporting the matter to\n\nthe police makes the prosecution's case highly suspect. There are\n\nmajor contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses, which made the prosecution's case highly suspect.\n\nLearned Trial Court had acquitted the accused for the\n\ncommission of the offence punishable under \nSection 306\n of IPC,\n\nbut convicted him of the commission of the offence punishable\n\nunder \nSection 498-A\n of IPC, which is impermissible. The defence\n\nevidence made it highly probable that the deceased was short-\n\ntempered lady. She had a dispute with her husband regarding the\n\n 9\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\ndistribution of meat. \nTestimony of Dil Bahadur (DW1) proved this\n\nfact. Learned Trial Court erred in rejecting the testimony of Dil\n\nBahadur (DW1). He prayed that the present appeal be allowed and\n\nthe judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the\n\nlearned Trial Court be set aside. He relied upon the judgments in\n\nJafarudheen and others Vs. State of Kerala\n (\n2022) 8 SCC 440, State of\n\nMadhya Pradesh Vs. Ratan Singh and others\n (\n2020) 12 SCC 630,\n\nJagdishraj Khatta Vs. State of H.P.\n (\n2019) 9 SCC 248, D. Thamodaran\n\nVs. Kandasamy and another\n (\n2015) 16 SCC 758 and Nirat Singh Vs.\n\nSita Devi and others\n 2025:HHC:5345 in support of his submission.\n\n10. Mr. Ajit Sharma, learned Deputy Advocate General for\n\nthe respondent-State, submitted that the learned Trial Court\n\nacquitted the accused because it was not proved that the accused\n\nintended the deceased to commit suicide. No finding was\n\nrecorded that she was not subjected to cruelty. Therefore, the\n\nacquittal of the accused by the learned Trial Court will not help\n\nthe defence. There was sufficient evidence on record to prove the\n\ninvolvement of the accused. Therefore, he prayed that the\n\npresent appeal be dismissed.\n\n11. I have given considerable thought to the submissions\n\nmade at the bar and have gone through the records carefully.\n\n 10\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n12. It was submitted that the learned Trial Court could\n\nnot have acquitted the accused of the commission of an offence\n\npunishable under \nSection 306\n of the IPC and convicted him of the\n\ncommission of an offence punishable under \nSection 498A\n of the\n\nIPC. This Submission is not acceptable. It was \nlaid down by\n the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in \nRamesh Kumar v. State of Chhattisgarh\n,\n\n(2001) 9 SCC 618 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 1088 : 2001 SCC OnLine SC 1260\n\nthat offences punishable under \nSections 498A\n and \n306\n of IPC are\n\nindependent of each other and it is not necessary that the person\n\nshould be found guilty of the commission of both offences on the\n\nsame evidence. It was observed at page 629:\n\n \"22. \nSections 498-A\n and \n306\n IPC are independent and\n constitute different offences. Though, depending on the\n facts and circumstances of an individual case, subjecting a\n woman to cruelty may amount to an offence under \nSection\n 498-A\n and may also, if a course of conduct amounting to\n cruelty is established leaving no other option for the\n woman except to commit suicide, amount to abetment to\n commit suicide. However, merely because an accused has\n been held liable to be punished under \nSection 498-A\n IPC it\n does not follow that on the same evidence he must also\n and necessarily be held guilty of having abetted the\n commission of suicide by the woman concerned...\"\n\n13. A similar view was taken in \nGirdhar Shankar Tawade v.\n\nState of Maharashtra\n, (2002) 5 SCC 177 : 2002 SCC (Cri) 971 : 2002\n\nSCC OnLine SC 510 wherein it was observed at page 183:\n\n 11\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n \"17. As regards the core issue as to whether charges under\n \nSections 306\n and \n498-A\n of the Penal Code, 1860 are\n independent of each other and acquittal of one does not\n lead to acquittal on the other, as noticed earlier, there\n appears to be a long catena of cases in affirmation thereto\n and as such further dilation is not necessary neither are we\n inclined to do so...\"\n\n14. Learned Trial Court acquitted the accused because the\n\nevidence on record did not indicate that the accused had intended\n\nthat the deceased to commit suicide. Learned Trial Court had not\n\nrecorded any finding that the deceased was not subjected to\n\ncruelty. Therefore, no advantage can be derived from the\n\nacquittal recorded by the learned Trial Court.\n\n15. The scope of \nSection 498-A\n of IPC was explained by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nAluri Venkata Ramana vs. Aluri\n\nThirupathi Rao and Ors.\n (12.12.2024 - SC Order):\n\nMANU/SCOR/151680/2024, wherein it was observed: -\n\n \"7. Firstly, the provision under \nSection 498-A\n IPC must be\n examined. The said provision reads as under:\n\n \"498A. Husband or relative of the husband of a woman\n subjecting her to cruelty. - Whoever, being the\n husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,\n subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with\n imprisonment for a term which may extend to three\n years and shall also be liable to a fine.\n Explanation. - For the purposes of this section,\n \"cruelty\" means-\n\n (a) any willful conduct which is of such a nature\n as is likely to drive the woman to commit suicide\n or to cause grave injury or danger to life, limb,\n\n 12\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n or health (whether mental or physical) of the\n woman; or\n\n (b) harassment of the woman where such\n harassment is with a view to coercing her or any\n person related to her to meet any unlawful\n demand for any property or valuable security or\n is on account of failure by her or any person\n related to her to meet such demand.\"\n\n8. \nSection 498A\n of the IPC was introduced in the year 1983\nwith the primary objective of protecting married women\nfrom cruelty at the hands of their husbands or their in-laws.\nThe section provides a broad and inclusive definition of\n\"cruelty,\" encompassing both physical and mental harm to\nthe woman's body or health. In addition, it covers acts of\nharassment designed to coerce the woman or her family into\nfulfilling unlawful demands for property or valuable security,\nincluding demands related to dowry. Notably, the provision\nalso recognizes acts that create circumstances leading a\nwoman to the point of suicide as a form of cruelty.\n\n9. The definition of \"harassment\" under the Explanation to\n\nSection 498A\n is specifically outlined in clause (b),\nindependent of the \"wilful conduct\" described in clause (a),\nthus necessitating a separate reading of the two. It is\nsignificant to note that the inclusion of the word \"or\" at the\nend of clause (a) clearly indicates that \"cruelty\" for the\npurposes of \nSection 498A\n can either involve wilful conduct\nthat causes mental or physical harm or harassment related to\nunlawful demands, such as dowry. Moreover, these forms of\ncruelty can co-exist, but the absence of a dowry-related\ndemand does not preclude the application of the section in\ncases where there is mental or physical harassment\nunrelated to the dowry. In interpreting the provision, it is\ncrucial to consider the broader objective behind its\nintroduction to safeguarding women from all forms of\ncruelty, regardless of whether the nature of the harm\ninflicted includes a specific demand for dowry or not.\n\n10. The statement of objects and reasons for the introduction\nof this provision in the \nIndian Penal Code\n by The Criminal\nLaw (Second Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act No.45 of 1983)\nreads as under -\n\n 13\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n \"The increasing number of Dowry Deaths is a matter\n of serious concern. The extent of the evil has been\n commented upon by the Joint Committee of the\n Houses to examine the workings of the \nDowry\n Prohibition Act\n of 1961. Cases of cruelty by the\n husband and the relatives of the husband, which\n culminate in suicide by, or murder of, the hapless\n woman concerned, constitute only a small fraction of\n the cases involving such cruelty. It is therefore\n proposed to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Code of\n Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act\n suitably to deal effectively not only with cases of\n Dowry Death but also cases of cruelty to married\n women by their in-laws.\"\n\n11. It is relevant to note the last line, which explains that the\naim of the introduction of Section 498A in the \nIPC\n is not only\nto curb cruelty relating to dowry demand but also cases of\ncruelty to married woman by their in-laws. A reasonable\ninterpretation of this would be that cruelty within this\nsection goes beyond the definition of cruelty relating just to\ndowry demand.\n\n12. \nIn the judgment of \nU. Suvetha v. State\n (2009)6 SCC 757, this\nCourt outlined the necessary ingredients required to\nestablish an offence under \nSection 498A\n of the IPC, as\nfollows:\n\n \"7. Ingredients of Section 498-A of the Penal Code are:\n\n (a)The woman must be married;\n\n (b) She must be subjected to cruelty or\n harassment; and\n\n (c) Such cruelty or harassment must have been\n shown either by the husband of the woman or by\n the relative of her husband.\"\n\n13. From the above ingredients reiterated by this Court, it is\nclear that an unlawful demand for dowry is not a pre-\nrequisite element to constitute \"cruelty\" under \nSection 498A\n\nIPC. It suffices that the conduct falls within either of the two\nbroad categories outlined in clauses (a) or (b) of the\nprovision, namely, wilful conduct likely to cause grave injury\nor mental harm (clause a), or harassment intended to coerce\n\n 14\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nthe woman or her family to meet any unlawful demand\n(clause b). Therefore, either form of cruelty, independent of\ndowry demand, is sufficient to attract the provisions of\n\nSection 498A\n IPC and make the offence punishable under the\nlaw.\n\n14. Further, in the judgment of \nArvind Singh v. State of Bihar\n\n(2001) 6 SCC 407, this Court observed that -\n\n \"25. The word 'cruelty' in common English\n acceptation denotes a state of conduct which is painful\n and distressing to another. The legislative intent in\n Section 498-A is clear enough to indicate that in the\n event of there being a state of conduct by the husband\n to the wife or by any relative of the husband which can\n be attributed to be painful or distressing, the same\n would be within the meaning of the section\".\n\n15. The impugned judgment of the High Court carefully\nexamined several legal precedents pertaining to the two\ndistinct limbs of \nSection 498A\n IPC. The High Court correctly\nobserved that the decisions cited by the counsel for the\naccused did not establish that the wilful conduct referred to\nin clause (a) of Section 498A would only be considered as\ncruelty if it is coupled with a dowry demand or any unlawful\ndemand for property or valuable security, as specified in\nclause (b). The High Court rightly rejected this contention.\nHowever, following this observation, the High Court also\nnoted that the Appellant did not specifically allege a demand\nfor property or valuable security, and further concluded that\nthe allegation of the accused physically assaulting the\nAppellant did not amount to \"wilful conduct\" as envisaged\nunder clause (a) of \nSection 498A\n IPC. The judgment of the\nHigh Court primarily focused on the issue of whether a\ndowry demand is a necessary element for the applicability of\n\nSection 498A\n IPC. The conclusion it arrived at was that the\ntwo clauses of the provision must be read disjunctively,\nthereby confirming that the absence of a dowry demand does\nnot preclude the application of the section. Despite this, the\nHigh Court went on to quash the criminal proceedings\nagainst the accused under \nSection 498A\n IPC. Notably, the\nHigh Court failed to provide adequate reasoning as to why\nthe allegations made by the Appellant, specifically that she\nhad been physically beaten, did not amount to \"cruelty\"\n\n 15\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n under \nSection 498A\n IPC. The High Court's decision to quash\n the proceedings appears to have been primarily influenced\n by the lack of a dowry-related demand in the case, without\n addressing the broader implications of the allegations of\n physical abuse, which can fall within the scope of \"cruelty\"\n as contemplated by the provision.\"\n\n16. It is apparent from the judgment of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court that the definition of Cruelty not only covers the\n\nacts of harassment designed to coerce the woman or her family\n\ninto fulfilling unlawful demands of dowry but also recognises the\n\nacts which involve mental or physical harm to the deceased.\n\n17. Pooja Devi (PW2) is the daughter of the deceased. She\n\nwas residing with the accused and the deceased; therefore, she is\n\nthe best person to depose about household affairs. She stated\n\nthat the accused is her father. He used to sell illicit liquor. Lata\n\nDevi protested the sale of the liquor. The accused used to quarrel\n\nwith the deceased under the influence of liquor. She (Pooja) did\n\nnot have good relations with the accused because of the\n\nharassment of her mother. She was present in her home on\n\n22.6.2008. Labourers were called to carry out the construction\n\nwork 15-20 days before the death of Lata Devi. Lata Devi went to\n\nthe labourers to serve tea, where the accused pulled the\n\ndrawstring of her salwar in the presence of labourers. Lata Devi\n\nstarted weeping and telephoned her brother and sister about the\n\n 16\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nincident. She (Pooja) reached the village in the morning of\n\n22.6.2008 due to a Pooja function. Lata Devi was also to go to the\n\nTribhuni Temple for Pooja. Accused hired a vehicle to go to the\n\ntemple, but he did not take her and Lata Devi to the temple. Lata\n\nDevi was keen to visit the temple on that day. The accused\n\nreturned from the temple at 4.00 PM. Lata was at home. She\n\nasked the accused why he was late. The accused became furious\n\nand started damaging the windows with an axe. Accused and Lata\n\nDevi shut the door and quarrelled inside the room. She (Pooja)\n\nwas studying in her room. She came out of the room after some\n\ntime, but did not find her mother in the house. She came to know\n\nafter some time that Lata Devi had committed suicide by hanging\n\nherself in a nearby jungle. Lata Devi committed suicide because\n\nthe accused used to torture her frequently, and he had made her\n\nlife miserable. She stated in her cross-examination that the\n\nname of her father is Naresh. He met her on the way when she\n\nwas going to the house of the accused. The accused went to the\n\nTribhuni Temple with other persons. When she reached the\n\nhouse, Lata Devi was doing the household chores, and she also\n\nhelped her with the work. She took lunch at about Noon and went\n\nto her room. The accused returned at about 4.00 PM. She was not\n\n 17\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\naware that Dil Bahadur had accompanied the accused. The\n\naccused had brought the entire meat to the house, and Lata Devi\n\ndid not tell him why he had distributed the meat on the way while\n\ncoming from the temple. All the people had consumed alcohol\n\nwhile returning from the temple. Lata Devi told something to the\n\naccused, and the accused started quarrelling with her. He could\n\nnot say what was told by Lata Devi, which infuriated the accused.\n\nDil Bahadur (DW1) started separating the share of the villagers,\n\nwhich was to be distributed as Prasad. She was studying in the\n\nroom. Dil Bahadur (DW1) stayed in the house for half an hour and\n\nthereafter went for the distribution of meat as Prasad. The\n\naccused returned when news of the death of Lata Devi spread.\n\nSisters and brothers of Lata had also visited the house on that\n\nevening. The police made inquiries to them about the cause of\n\ndeath. Lata Devi wanted her (Pooja) to marry Ajay, and the\n\nmarriage between them was fixed, but she refused to marry him\n\nbecause her maternal uncle did not give consent to the marriage.\n\nShe denied that Lata Devi was upset due to this act. Prem Chand\n\nand Sandeep were labourers working in the house when the\n\naccused had pulled the drawstring of the salwar. She had\n\nreturned to the house on the very night when Lata Devi had\n\n 18\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\ncommitted suicide. She was residing with her Aunt Kanta at\n\nNahan. She denied that the accused had not harassed Lata Devi,\n\nand she was making a false statement.\n\n18. Kanta Devi (PW11) corroborated her version. She\n\nstated that Lata Devi told her many times that the accused used\n\nto torture and humiliate her on petty matters. The accused is\n\ninvolved in the business of the illicit distillation and sale of\n\nliquor. He used to beat Lata Devi in a state of intoxication. Pooja\n\nwas born to Lata Devi during the subsistence of her earlier\n\nmarriage. She resided in the house of the accused. She had\n\nshifted to her (Kanta's) house to pursue her studies at Nahan,\n\nand she was facing a problem on account of the maltreatment\n\nmeted out to her and Lata Devi. Pooja had gone to the house of\n\nthe accused on 22.6.2008, at about 6.00 AM. She (Kanta) received\n\na message on the same day at about 7.45 PM that Lata Devi had\n\ncommitted suicide. She stated in her cross-examination that she\n\nhad received information about the death of Lata Devi from the\n\nVillage Teeb. She and Kamlesh visited the house of Lata Devi. Her\n\nstatement was recorded by the police after 2-3 days. She had told\n\nthe police that the accused used to distil illicit liquor. She had not\n\npersonally seen the accused beating and harassing Lata Devi.\n\n 19\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nPooja was residing with her for about two months before the\n\ndeath of Lata Devi. She used to pursue her studies from her home.\n\nThe police were present in the house of Lata Devi and were\n\ninquiring about the cause of death. Police had also made\n\nenquiries from her. Pooja had not returned with her. She\n\nvolunteered to say that Pooja remained in the house of her\n\nmaternal uncle, Sirmour Singh. She returned to the house of the\n\naccused on the next day. Pooja never liked the accused. She\n\nvolunteered to say that the accused used to harass her. The\n\naccused even used to charge diet money from Lata Devi. She was\n\nnot aware of Lata Devi's source of income. She did not know\n\nwhether Sirmour Singh, his brother and their wives or Veena\n\nwere present at the time of recording the statement of Pooja.\n\nThey had never reported to any authority about the harassment\n\nof Lata Devi.\n\n19. The presence of Pooja in the house is established by\n\nthe testimony of this witness. She categorically stated that Pooja\n\nleft her home on 22.6.2008. This is also probable because\n\neveryone had gone to the Tribhuni temple on that day. The meat\n\nwas being distributed as a Prasad. Hence, the presence of Pooja in\n\nthe house of the accused cannot be doubted.\n\n 20\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n20. The statement of Pooja that the quarrel had taken\n\nplace between the accused and the deceased was also not\n\ndisputed by the accused in his statement recorded under Section\n\n313 of the Cr. P.C. The accused stated that the deceased had\n\ninquired from him why he had brought less meat. He even\n\nexamined Dil Bahadur (DW1) to prove this fact. Hence, the\n\ntestimony regarding the quarrel is to be accepted as correct, and\n\nthis shows the presence of Pooja on 22.6.2008. Sirmour Singh\n\n(PW3) also stated that Pooja was present in the house. This is\n\nalso corroborated by the statement of Dy.SP Vijay Kumar (PW12),\n\nwho recorded the statement of Pooja at 11.00 PM. Hence, the\n\npresence of Pooja in the house on the date of the incident is duly\n\nestablished.\n\n21. Dil Bahadur (DW1) stated that the accused brought\n\nless meat, and Lata became infuriated. She started inquiring\n\nfrom the accused as to why the entire goat was not brought\n\nhome. The accused replied that he had distributed some meat to\n\nthe persons living at a distance of 3 to 5 kilometres from his\n\nhouse. Lata Devi took up a quarrel with the accused. He (Dil\n\nBahadur) tried to pacify her by saying that there was nothing\n\nwrong with distributing meat, but when the situation did not\n\n 21\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nimprove, he sent the accused to his house, and he started making\n\npieces of the meat. Satish Kumar also came to the spot for the\n\ndistribution of the meat to the villagers.\n\n22. The statement of this witness is relevant regarding\n\nthe commission of an offence punishable under \nSection 306\n of\n\nIPC; however, the learned Trial Court has acquitted the accused\n\nof the commission of an offence punishable under \nSection 306\n of\n\nIPC by holding that the incident dated 22.6.2008 was not duly\n\nproved. Therefore, his testimony is not relevant regarding the\n\ncruelty meted out to the deceased.\n\n23. It was submitted that Pooja deposed about the\n\nincident of pulling the drawstring of salwar of Lata Devi by the\n\naccused in presence of Prem and Sandeep. The police did not\n\nexamine Prem and Sandeep, and it is sufficient to discard the\n\nprosecution's case. This submission is not acceptable. It was \nlaid\n\ndown by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nAppabhai v. State of\n\nGujarat\n, 1988 Supp SCC 241: 1988 SCC (Cri) 559 that the\n\nprosecution's case cannot be doubted due to the non-\n\nexamination of the independent witnesses. It was observed at\n\npage 245:\n\n 22\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n \"11. In light of these principles, we may now consider the\n first contention urged by the learned counsel for the ap-\n\n pellants. The contention relates to the failure of the prose-\n cution to examine independent witnesses. The High Court\n has examined this contention but did not find any infir-\n mity in the investigation. It is no doubt true that the pros-\n ecution has not been able to produce any independent wit-\n ness to the incident that took place at the bus stand. There\n must have been several such witnesses. But the prosecu-\n tion's case cannot be thrown out or doubted on that\n ground alone. The experience reminds us that civilised\n people are generally insensitive when a crime is commit-\n ted even in their presence. They withdraw both from the\n victim and the vigilante. They keep themselves away from\n the court unless it is inevitable. They think that a crime,\n like a civil dispute, is between two individuals or parties,\n and they should not involve themselves. This kind of apa-\n thy of the general public is indeed unfortunate, but it is\n there everywhere, whether in village life, towns or cities.\n One cannot ignore this handicap with which the investi-\n gating agency has to discharge its duties. The court, there-\n fore, instead of doubting the prosecution's case for want\n of an independent witness, must consider the broad spec-\n trum of the prosecution's version and then search for the\n nugget of truth with due regard to probability, if any, sug-\n gested by the accused.\"\n\n24. It was \nlaid down by\n Hon'ble Supreme Court in Pohlu v.\n\nState of Haryana, (2005) 10 SCC 196: 2005 SCC (Cri) 1496: 2004 SCC\n\nOnLine SC 1393, that the intrinsic worth of the testimony of\n\nwitnesses has to be assessed by the Court and if the testimony of\n\nthe witnesses appears to be truthful, the non-examination of\n\nother witnesses will not make the testimony of prosecution\n\nwitness doubtful. It was observed at page 199: -\n\n 23\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n \"10. It was then submitted that some of the material\n witnesses were not examined, and, in this connection, it\n was argued that two of the eye-witnesses named in the\n FIR, namely, Chander and Sita Ram, were not examined by\n the prosecution. Dharamvir, son of Sukhdei, was also not\n examined by the prosecution, though he was a material\n witness, being an injured eyewitness, having witnessed\n the assault that took place in the house of Sukhdei, PW 2.\n\n It is true that it is not necessary for the prosecution to\n multiply witnesses if it prefers to rely upon the evidence of\n eyewitnesses examined by it, which it considers sufficient\n to prove the case of the prosecution. However, the\n intrinsic worth of the testimony of the witnesses\n examined by the prosecution has to be assessed by the\n Court. If their evidence appears to be truthful, reliable and\n acceptable, the mere fact that some other witnesses have\n not been examined will not adversely affect the case of the\n prosecution. We have, therefore, to examine the evidence\n of the two eye witnesses, namely, PW 1 and PW 2, and to\n find whether their evidence is true, on the basis of which\n the conviction of the appellants can be sustained. \"\n\n25. It was laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nSrichand K. Khetwani v. State of Maharashtra\n, 1966 SCC OnLine SC\n\n32 : (1967) 1 SCR 595: AIR 1967 SC 450: 1967 Cri LJ 414: (1967) 2 SCJ\n\n178, that an adverse inference can be drawn for withholding\n\ncertain evidence and not for failure to obtain the evidence. It was\n\nobserved\n\n \"8. Further, an adverse inference against the prosecution\n can be drawn only if it withholds certain evidence and not\n merely on account of its failure to obtain certain evidence.\n When no such evidence has been obtained, it cannot be\n said what that evidence could have been and therefore, no\n question of presuming that that evidence would have been\n\n 24\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n against the prosecution, under Section 114, illustration (g)\n of the \nEvidence Act\n, can arise.\"\n\n26. The testimonies of Prem and Sandeep would have\n\nbeen necessary to corroborate the testimony of Pooja, but her\n\ntestimony is satisfactory, as noticed above, and the non-\n\nexamination of Prem and Sandeep will not be fatal to the\n\nprosecution's case.\n\n27. It was submitted that the incident had taken place on\n\n22.6.2008, and the matter was reported to the police on\n\n23.6.2008 in the morning. The delay in reporting the matter to\n\nthe police is fatal to the prosecution's case. This submission\n\ncannot be accepted. The delay in reporting the matter does not\n\nlead to the rejection of the prosecution's case but merely puts the\n\nCourt on caution. (Please see \nJafarudeen and others\n (supra), \nRatan\n\nSingh\n (supra), \nD. Thamodaran\n (supra) and \nNeeraj Singh\n (supra).\n\n28. Dy.SP Vijay Sharma (PW12) stated in his cross-\n\nexamination that he had made inquiries from the brothers of the\n\ndeceased and the persons present in the house of the accused on\n\n22.6.2008 about the reason of suicide and found out that there\n\nwas an exchange of hot words between the deceased and the\n\naccused over the distribution of meat. The statement of Pooja\n\n 25\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nwas recorded at 11.00 PM. She and other relatives had gathered at\n\nthe house because of the death of Lata.\n\n29. The cross-examination of this witness shows that he\n\nhad come to know about the quarrel between the accused and the\n\ndeceased. Strictly speaking, the statement made to the\n\nInvestigating Officer during the investigation is hearsay and\n\ncannot be admitted; however, the defence itself had put these\n\nquestions, and these answers were relied on during arguments,\n\ntherefore, they are being referred to. These answers do not\n\nsuggest that any fresh version was introduced which was not told\n\nto the Investigating Officer on the night of 22.6.2008.\n\n30. Veena Devi (PW1) stated that the accused and\n\ndeceased resided happily for 2-3 years after their marriage,\n\nhowever, the accused started taking liquor and giving beatings to\n\nthe deceased. The deceased used to call her (Veena Devi) and tell\n\nher about the behaviour of the accused. Lata Devi informed her\n\n(Veena) about one month before her death that the drawstring of\n\nher salwar was hanging outside the shirt. The accused pulled the\n\ndrawstring and made her naked in the presence of labourers. She\n\ninquired from the accused, who said that it had happened by\n\nmistake and he would behave normally in future. Lata Devi\n\n 26\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\ninformed her on 21.6.2008 that the accused was harassing her.\n\nShe called her (Veena Devi) to her house, but she could not visit\n\nLata's matrimonial home. Lata Devi again called her in the\n\nmorning of 22.6.2008 and told her that they had to visit the\n\nTribhuni temple, and she asked Veena Devi (PW1) to accompany\n\nher. She (Veena Devi) told Lata Devi that her family had already\n\nhired a vehicle. The police informed her in the evening of\n\n22.6.2008 that Lata Devi had committed suicide. She stated in her\n\ncross-examination that she had received the call from Khem\n\nChand, who was serving in the police at Nahan and is related to\n\nher. Lata was married to Naresh, and Pooja was born during the\n\nsubsistence of the marriage. Lata sought a divorce because her\n\nmother-in-law used to harass her. She specifically denied that\n\nLata Devi had a short temper. The accused had eloped with Lata\n\nto marry her; however, no complaint was made regarding this\n\nfact. Pooja was studying at Nahan and was residing with Kanta\n\nDevi on the date of deposition. 5-6 persons had accompanied the\n\naccused to the Tribhuni temple. She did not visit the house of the\n\naccused as his behaviour with Lata Devi was not proper. Her\n\nbrother, Sirmour Singh, her wife, two sons, Sukh Bahadur, his\n\nwife, and her son-in-law accompanied her to the house of the\n\n 27\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\naccused. The police visited the house of the accused on that day.\n\nThe accused was also sitting with the police. She denied that\n\nPooja shifted to Nahan because it was inconvenient for her to\n\nattend College from Village Teeb. Pooja told her that the accused\n\nhad distributed meat on the way, which led to a quarrel. She had\n\nnot complained about the beatings to her sister or any authority.\n\n31. It was submitted in her testimony that Pooja had told\n\nher about the distribution of the meat on the way is contrary to\n\nthe statement of Pooja, who claimed that the accused had\n\nbrought the whole meat to the house, and this contradiction\n\nadversely affects the prosecution's case. This submission is not\n\nacceptable. Pooja was never asked about the statement made to\n\nthis witness, even though this witness was cross-examined\n\nbefore Pooja. It was \nlaid down by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\nMajid v. State of Haryana\n, (2001) 10 SCC 6: 2002 SCC (Cri) 945: 2001\n\nSCC OnLine SC 1439 that the attention of the witness must be\n\ndrawn to his previous oral statement to impeach his credit. It was\n\nobserved at page 10:\n\n \"14. If the former statement was in writing or was reduced to\n writing, \nSection 145\n of the Act requires that the attention of\n the witness must be called to those parts of it which are used\n for the purpose of contradicting him. Here, the statement\n allegedly made by PW 6 to DW 1 was not in writing, nor was it\n reduced to writing. Nonetheless, if the object of examining\n\n 28\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\n DW 1 as a witness was to discredit PW 6, it is only fair to\n insist that PW 6 himself should have been given an\n opportunity to explain it. Without PW 6 being asked about\n that aspect, it is unreasonable to expect PW 6 to explain\n about it. Hence, it is immaterial that the statement claimed\n by DW 1 as made to him by PW 6 was not reduced to writing.\n\n 15. When PW 6 was cross-examined by the defence counsel,\n he was not asked anything about the alleged statement made\n by him to DW 1. In such a situation, we cannot give any\n credence to the evidence of DW 1.\"\n\n32. In the present case, the attention of Pooja was not\n\ndrawn towards the previous inconsistent statement made to\n\nVeena; therefore, no advantage can be derived from this\n\nstatement made by Veena Devi (PW1).\n\n33. Sirmour Singh (PW3) stated that Lata was his sister\n\nwho was married to the accused in 1993 on her own choice. Lata\n\nDevi used to visit his house frequently, and she used to tell him\n\nand his wife, Savitri, Ex-Pradhan of Gram Panchayat Devka\n\nPurla, about the harassment meted out to her by the accused in\n\nher daily life. The accused indulged in the distilling and selling of\n\nillicit liquor, which led to a quarrel between the accused and the\n\ndeceased. The accused used to beat Lata Devi in a state of\n\nintoxication. He stated in his cross-examination that his house is\n\nabout 3-4 kilometres from the house of the accused. Accused and\n\nLata were not on visiting terms at his house for about two years\n\nafter their marriage. However, they used to visit his house\n\n 29\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nafterwards on the occasion of marriages. He had never\n\ncomplained to the police or the Panchayat about the harassment\n\nof Lata Devi or the selling of illicit liquor by the accused. The\n\npolice were present in the house of Lata Devi when they visited\n\nher house. They remained in the house of the accused till\n\nmidnight. He had told the police about the harassment and the\n\nbeatings. The police also made inquiries of Pooja.\n\n34. It was submitted that no witness had made any\n\ncomplaint against the accused for the distillation of illicit liquor.\n\nThis will not make the prosecution's case suspect. The accused\n\nwas married to Lata, the sister of the prosecution witnesses.\n\nSending the accused to Jail would have put Lata in financial\n\ndifficulties, and not much can be made out from the failure to\n\nreport the illicit distillation to the police.\n\n35. Sirmour Singh (PW3) specifically stated that the\n\ncomplaint was made to Savitri. This is the earliest version made\n\nto the police that the complaints were made to Savitri, Ex-\n\nPradhan of Gram Panchayat, Devka Purla. \nIn any case, it was \nlaid\n\ndown by\n the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nJayedeepsinh Pravinsinh\n\nChavda v. State of Gujarat\n, (2025) 2 SCC 116: (2025) 1 SCC (Cri) 652:\n\n2024 SCC OnLine SC 3679 that failure to report the matter does\n\n 30\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nnot make the prosecution's case suspect. It was observed at page\n\n122:\n\n 17. The appellants' argument that the deceased had not made\n a single complaint for cruelty or harassment against the\n appellants in the twelve years of marriage cannot be\n sustained. Merely because she did not file any complaint for\n twelve years does not guarantee that there was no instance of\n cruelty or harassment.\n\n36. It was submitted that Veena Devi (PW1) said in her\n\ncross-examination that Lata Devi used to confide in her because\n\nshe was afraid of her brother; therefore, the testimony of\n\nSirmour Singh (PW3) is not reliable. This submission cannot be\n\naccepted because it was specifically mentioned in the initial\n\nversion that complaints were made to Savitri, Ex-Pradhan.\n\n37. Kamlesh (PW5) stated that Lata Devi was her cousin,\n\nbeing the daughter of her Massi (Maternal Aunt). Lata Devi\n\nresided in her neighbourhood. Lata Devi used to complain that\n\nthe accused was beating her occasionally. She stated in her\n\ncross-examination that her mother and mother of Lata Devi are\n\nreal sisters. Pooja was residing with her parents in her home, and\n\nshe started residing with Kanta Devi after the death of her\n\nmother. She was not aware when the statement of Pooja was\n\nrecorded by the police. Pooja had gone to the house of the\n\naccused one day before the date of the incident. She was\n\n 31\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nfrequently visiting the house of her maternal aunt. She denied\n\nthat she was making a false statement.\n\n38. Her testimony is natural and corroborates the\n\nstatement of Kanta Devi (PW11). Nothing was shown in her\n\ncross-examination that she had any motive to depose falsely\n\nagainst the accused.\n\n39. Satish (PW4) did not support the prosecution's case.\n\nHe stated that he visited the Tribhuni temple on 22.6.2008 with\n\nthe accused. He could not say whether Pooja (PW2) was at home\n\non that day. The accused had asked him to distribute the meat of\n\nthe sacrificed goat amongst the villagers. When he reached the\n\nhouse, the doors were open, and nobody was present in the\n\nhouse. He saw the dead body of Lata Devi hanging in a tree at a\n\ndistance of 100 metres. The accused was present in the house of\n\nDil Bahadur (DW1). He informed about the discovery of the dead\n\nbody. He was permitted to be cross-examined. He denied that he\n\nsaw Pooja (PW2) watching TV in her room. He denied that he had\n\ninquired from Pooja about Lata Devi, who replied that Lata Devi\n\nwas not at home. He denied that he and Pooja searched for Lata\n\nDevi. He denied that he was making a false statement. He denied\n\nthe previous statement recorded by the police. He stated in his\n\n 32\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\ncross-examination by learned counsel for the defence that there\n\nwas a fair in the temple of Tribhuni. Many people had gathered at\n\nthe fair. The vehicle in which the accused was travelling met him\n\non the way, and he requested a lift.\n\n40. The testimony of this witness will not make the\n\nprosecution's case suspect. He denied the presence of Pooja in\n\nthe house, but the presence of Pooja (PW2) is duly established by\n\nother evidence. Further, he was contradicted by his previous\n\nstatement wherein he had deposed about the presence of Pooja.\n\nThus, he is shown to have made two inconsistent statements,\n\nand his credibility has been impeached. Therefore, his testimony\n\ncannot be used to discard the prosecution's case.\n\n41. It was submitted that the statements of prosecution\n\nwitnesses are vague and general, and no particulars of time and\n\ndate were given. Reliance was placed upon the judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in \nJagdish Raj Khetta\n (supra). This\n\njudgment will not help the accused because Pooja and Veena have\n\nspecifically deposed that the accused had pulled the drawstring\n\nof the salwar of Lata Devi in the presence of the labourers. It was\n\na specific incident meant to humiliate Lata Devi in the presence\n\nof labourers. This incident corroborates the statements of the\n\n 33\n\n 2025:HHC:16788\n\nprosecution witnesses that the accused used to quarrel with the\n\ndeceased on trivial matters.\n\n42. Therefore, the learned Trial Court had rightly held\n\nthat the accused had treated the deceased with cruelty. Hence,\n\nthe accused was rightly convicted of the commission of an\n\noffence punishable under \nSection 498-A\n of the IPC.\n\n43. Learned Trial Court sentenced the accused to undergo\n\nrigorous imprisonment for two years and was directed to pay a\n\nfine of ₹3,000/-. This is not excessive, keeping in view the\n\nmanner in which the accused had humiliated the deceased in the\n\npresence of labourers, and no interference is required with the\n\nsentence imposed by the learned Trial Court.\n\n44. No other point is urged.\n\n45. In view of the above, the present appeal fails and the\n\nsame is dismissed.\n\n46. Records be sent back forthwith along with a copy of\n\nthe judgment. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed\n\nof.\n\n (Rakesh Kainthla)\n Judge\n 30th May, 2025\n (Chander)",

They keep themselves away from\n the court unless it is inevitable. They think that a crime,\n like a civil dispute, is between two individuals or parties,\n and they should not involve themselves. This kind of apa-\n thy of the general public is indeed unfortunate, but it is\n there everywhere, whether in village life, towns or cities.\n One cannot ignore this handicap with which the investi-\n gating agency has to discharge its duties. The court, there-\n fore, instead of doubting the prosecution's case for want\n of an independent witness, must consider the broad spec-\n trum of the prosecution's version and then search for the\n nugget of truth with due regard to probability, if any, sug-\n gested by the accused.\""
