For the petitioner\n\nMr. Arunava Ghosh\nMr. Sudhanshu Sil\nMr. Raj Kumar Basu\n... For the Punjab National Bank\n\nWrit petition was filed questioning refusal to grant\n\nseniority to the petitioner, on the basis of Middle\n\nManagement Group Scale-II.\n\nIt was submitted by Mr. Pinaki Dhole, learned\n\nCounsel led by Mr. Amar Nath Dhole, learned Counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner that the writ petitioner has\n\nmade representation sometime in the year 1983 and\n\nthereafter it was disposed of in the year 1990 without\n\ngranting appropriate relief to the writ petitioner.\n\nThereafter, he made further representation before the\n\nhigher authority and the higher authority replied that\n\nrepresentation could not be considered at that stage in\n\nview of pendency of review application.\n\nMr. Dhole submits even after dismissal of review\npetition the writ petitioner was not granted proper\n\nseniority and scale. Hence the writ petitioner filed this writ\n\npetition on 6th February, 1996.\n\nMr. Dhole submits that the writ petitioner is claiming\n\nthe benefit of Middle Management Group Scale-II in the\n\nNew India Bank with effect from 19th September, 1997\n\nwhen he was posted as manager on proposed sub-office at\n\nBhamukheri, district Ambala.\n\nMr. Dhole also contends that the writ petitioner is\n\nsimilarly placed with another employee namely, S.\n\nSainathan to whom all service benefits of Middle\n\nManagement Group Scale-II has been given with effect\n\nfrom the date when he was posted as manager in the\n\nproposed sub-office by virtue of the decision of the Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court at Andhra Pradesh. He also submits that the\n\nwrit petitioner joined the post as Manager on 19th\n\nSeptember, 1977 and was confirmed to the said post on 1st\n\nJune, 1979. He submits, against the order of refusal for\n\nconsideration as communicated by letter dated 19th\n\nFebruary, 1990 the petitioner preferred an appeal on 3rd\n\nMarch, 1990 against the impugned order of non-\n\nconsideration before the Chairman and the Director of the\n\nbank.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court dismissed the review\n\npetition on 5th March, 1993. Thereafter on 4th September,\n\n1993 by a notification of the Reserve Bank of India, New\n\nBank of India amalgamated with the Punjab National\n\nBank. On 28th February, 1994 the petitioner once again\n\nmade representation before the General Manager\n\n(Personnel), Punjab National Bank claiming fixation of his\n\nseniority in Middle Management Group Scale-II with effect\n\nfrom 19th September, 1977. Thereafter the writ petitioner\n\nmade several representations but to no effect.\n\nMr. Dhole submits that the matter was heard by the\n\nlearned Single Judge and the writ petition was allowed in\n\nfavour of the writ petitioner. However, the Bank\n\nauthorities preferred an appeal before the Hon'ble Division\n\nBench. The Hon'ble Appeal Court remanded back the\n\nmatter mainly on two points, namely, i) whether after such\n\nlong delay, any relief could be granted to the writ petitioner\n\nwhen admittedly the writ petitioner moved the writ\n\napplication in the year 1996 claiming his right of seniority\n\nin the post of Middle Management Group Scale-II with\n\neffect from 19th September, 1977; (ii) whether the case of\n\nSianathan is identical on the question of law as was urged\n\nand the factual matrix of the case as has been pleaded by\nthe writ petitioner.\n\nThe Hon'ble Appeal Court recorded in Their\n\nLordships' judgement that no answer and no analysis of\n\nthose two issues were available in the learned Single\n\nJudge's decision. However, the Hon'ble Appeal Court\n\nremanded the matter to decide all the issues including the\n\npoint of maintainability of the writ petition.\n\nMr. Dhole would contend the writ petitioner has\n\nexplained the delay. He further submits that there are\n\ndecisions in favour of the petitioner holding that if there\n\nare sufficient explanation for the delay the writ petition\n\nshould not be dismissed on that ground. He also submits\n\nthat the point of delay is to be taken at the threshold but\n\nin the instant case the point was not taken and the matter\n\nhas come after completion of all affidavits and this is the\n\nthird-round litigation before the Single Bench.\n\nMr. Dhole cited the decisions in support of his\n\naforementioned contention. First one is reported in A.I.R.\n\n1972 S.C. 908 (P.B. Roy Vs. Union of India); he has\n\nreferred paragraph 8 of the said judgement. Paragraph 8 of\n\nthe said judgement reads as follows :-\n\n\"8. The learned Judge who had initially heard the\npetition had pointed out that the representation of the\nAppellant was first rejected on 29-7-1960 and that it did\nnot matter that the petitioner had continued making\nsubsequent representations. The learned Judge had\nnoticed the explanation that the petitioner could not\napproach the Court as he was admitted to a Tuberculosis\nClinic in June, 1961. The learned Judge, having found\nthat this was not sufficient to explain the delay between\n29-7-1960 and June 1961 was disposed to reject the\npetition on the ground of laches. But, in view of the\ndecision of the majority of the Full Bench of the Punjab\nHigh Court in S. Gurmej Sing v. Election Tribunal,\nGurdaspur, (1964) 6 Pun LR 589 = (AIR 1964 Punj 337)\n(FB) the delay in filing the petition was overlooked on the\nground that, after the admission of a Writ Petition and\nhearing of arguments, the rule that delay may defeat the\nrights of a party is relaxed and need not be applied if his\ncase is 'positive good'.\"\n\nThe other judgement cited by Mr. Dhole is reported\n\nin A.I.R. 1990 S.C. 1308 (The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.\n\nBani Singh and another). Paragraph 8 of the\n\naforementioned judgement as referred by Mr. Dhole reads\n\nas follows :-\n\n\"8. The learned Counsel also contended that though\nScreening Committee met in 1979-80 the application\nunder\nSection 19\nof the Administrative Tribunals Act was\nfiled only on 19-12-1986 and that therefore the\napplication should have been dismissed on the ground of\ndelay and laches. The Tribunal considered this question\nin detail and held that since the representation for the\nyear 1981 was pending till 1986 and there is an allegation\nthat the respondent had been making representation to\n\nthe Government in this regard and in fact one such\nrepresentation was accepted and it is on that basis in\nspite of the fact that the facts and situations remained\nthe same in the 1982 and respondent was selected for\nselection grade with effect from 4-3-1982. In those\ncircumstances the Tribunal said that they were not\nwilling to dismiss the application on the ground of\nthe laches and it has to be decided on merits. In\nthese circumstances we are also unable to interfere\nwith the order of the Tribunal.\"\n\nThe other decision cited by Mr. Dhole is A.I.R. 1990\n\nPatna 11 (\nDr. Jagannath Mishrta Vs. State of Bihar and\n\nothers\n). He has referred paragraph 17 which reads as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\"17.\nIn\nP.B. Roy v. Union of India\n, AIR 1972 SC 908\nthe Supreme Court itself had laid down that the 'delay in\nfiling the petition under\nArticle 226\nmay be overlooked on\nthe ground that, after the admission of a writ petition and\nhearing of arguments, the rule that delay may defeat the\nrights of a party is relaxed and need not be applied if his\ncase is 'positively good'.\"\n\nMr. Dhole submits that there is no delay or laches on\n\nthe side of the writ petitioner. Therefore, the point of delay\n\nshould be ignored by the Hon'ble Court in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of this case and since there are sufficient\n\nexplanation to it. It was also submitted that the case of\nS.\nSainathan and the petitioner is standing on similar footing\n\nand they are also similarly placed. Therefore, the benefit\n\nwhich was given to S. Sainathan in view of Hon'ble\n\nAndhara Pradesh High Court judgement should also be\n\ngiven to the writ petitioner.\n\nMr. Dhole contended there is similarity of S.\n\nSainathan with the writ petitioner regarding appointment\n\nof both of them as Branch Manager. Therefore, they are\n\nsimilarly situated.\n\nMr. Dhole contended that in the affidavit-in-reply it\n\nwas specifically stated by the writ petitioner that he is\n\nsimilarly situated as S. Sainathan.\n\nLearned Counsel submits that the respondents are\n\nresponsible for making such discrimination and denial of\n\nthe benefit to the writ petitioner, although he is entitled to\n\nget the benefit with effect from 1977.\n\nMr. Arunava Ghosh, learned Counsel appearing for\n\nthe respondent-Bank submits that there is inordinate\n\ndelay in filing the writ application. He submits that the\n\nwrit petitioner made the first representation in the year\n\n1983 after the bank nationalisation effected on and from\n\n15th April, 1981. He submits on 1st January, 1983 Officer\n\nRegulation brought into operation. The writ petitioner\nopted for new scale. He was categorised in Junior\n\nManagement Group Scale-I as he was in scale of Rs.400 -\n\n1020/- in accordance with the Regulation VII and placed\n\nin the seniority list of that scale. So far other officers who\n\nwere working in the scale of Rs.500-1330/- were\n\ncategorised in the scale of Rs.1200-2000/- as Middle\n\nManagement Group Scale-II.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ghosh, all the officers of the bank\n\nwere categorised according to the Regulation VII. He also\n\nsubmits apart from the categorisation as Junior\n\nManagement Group Scale-I or Middle Management Group\n\nScale-II, there are other categorisation also in other scale\n\nwhich is not relevant for the present.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that S. Sainathan filed an appeal\n\nwithin thirty days as per Regulation XIII of the Officers'\n\nService Regulation since he did not accept his position in\n\nJunior Management Group Scale-I. On the other hand, not\n\nonly the petitioner did not file any such appeal, but also\n\naccepted his fitment, grade and seniority and the writ\n\npetitioner, in fact, clearly acquiesced him to a senior\n\nposition given to him and the fitment given in Junior\n\nManagement Group Scale-I.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits the writ petitioner is estopped\nfrom challenging the action of the respondent authorities.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ghosh, these are the facts which make\n\nthe case of the writ petitioner different from that of S.\n\nSainathan.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that S. Sainathan's case did not\n\nlay any proposition of law that all the persons who are\n\nsenior to Sainathan should also be made Middle\n\nManagement Group Scale-II. He submits there is no such\n\nobservation either by Andha Pradesh High Court or by the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ghosh, S. Sainathan's case has\n\nbeen decided on its own fact and the benefit of that case is\n\nnot available to the writ petitioner or the writ petitioner is\n\nalso not entitled to claim such benefit.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that one retired officer of the\n\nBank namely, Sri R. D. Rao filed a contempt petition in the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court after order dated 20th February,\n\n1992, disposing of the bank's Special Leave Petition and\n\nclaimed similar relief. The said petition was dismissed by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order dated 4th February,\n\n1991. He submits that thereafter Mr. Rao filed a writ\n\npetition under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution of India,\n\nwhich was also dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nvide order dated 17th January, 1994. Therefore, this\n\nclearly shows that the benefit of the judgement in case of\n\nS. Sainathan cannot be extended to others including the\n\npetitioner. He submits the present writ petition is solely\n\nbased on the judgement of S. Sainathan and the writ\n\npetition is misconceived. The same should be dismissed on\n\nthat ground.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits some other officers have also\n\nfiled the writ petition claiming similar relief, being CWP\n\n5650 of 1984 (\nK.B. Sharma and Ors. Vs. New Bank of\n\nIndia\n& ors.). The learned Single Bench of Punjab and\n\nHaryana High Court allowed the writ petition on 3rd\n\nFebruary, 1988. The erstwhile New Bank of India filed\n\nappeal against the judgement and the said LPA 310 of\n\n1988 was allowed by the Division Bench on 23rd March,\n\n1990 and the judgement of the Hon'ble Single Bench was\n\nset aside and the writ petition of the writ petitioners was\n\ndismissed.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that the writ petitioner himself is\n\nadmitting that he was under scale Rs.400-1000/- which is\n\ndifferent from Branch Manager scale of Rs.500-1200/-.\n\nThe petitioner also admitted that he was posted at sub-\n\noffice and not in a branch office. It is also admitted by the\npetitioner that he could not achieve the deposit target and\n\nas such his probation period is extended.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits in the facts and circumstances of\n\nthis case it would appear that the writ petitioner has\n\naccepted his fitment in Junior Management Group Scale-I\n\nand was paid arrear of salary on account of revised\n\nfitment. He submits after lapse of 13 years he filed the\n\nwrit petition challenging the said fitment, which was done\n\nlong 13 years ago.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits the writ petitioner is estopped\n\nfrom challenging the fitment, which was settled before 13\n\nyears. The writ petition was filed without any explanation\n\nof inordinate delay and therefore, this writ petition should\n\nbe dismissed.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits it would appear from the reply\n\nunder paragraph 8, filed by the writ petitioner, that\n\nalthough he has raised a protest against the categorisation\n\nand placement in Junior Management Group Scale-I in\n\n1983 and he was not allowed to participate in March, 1985\n\npromotion process as cut off date to complete 7 years as\n\nper new guideline, he did not file the writ petition rather he\n\nparticipated in the promotion process from Junior\n\nManagement Group Scale-I to Middle Management Group\nScale-II on the basis of a call letter dated 25th January,\n\n1991 and appeared before the Committee on 4th February,\n\n1991 and got promotion as well as the grade with effect\n\nfrom 1991.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that although he has accepted\n\n1984 promotion list and also appeared in the selection\n\nprocess in 1991 and further got the promotion in 1991 but\n\nhe made representation one after another without taking\n\nany legal action either by filing a writ petition or any other\n\nstep against the respondent authorities. He submits that\n\nall these actions on the side of the writ petitioner clearly\n\nshows that he himself waived his claim after acceptance of\n\nthe promotion list prepared in 1984 and thereafter in\n\n1992.\n\nAccording to Mr. Ghosh, the writ petitioner should\n\nnot be permitted to get the benefit of such fixation and\n\npromotion.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that even after rejection of the\n\nprayer in 1990 the writ petitioner did not come up before\n\nthis Court rather he participated in 1991 selection process\n\nfor having promotion. He submits that the writ petitioner\n\nought to have come in the year 1984 when he was not\n\nallowed to appear in the promotion process and a different\nseniority list was prepared for Middle Management Group\n\nScale-II ignoring his claim as alleged by him rather he has\n\nawaited for long 12 years after 1984 and challenged the\n\nfitment by filing a writ petition only in 1996.\n\nMr. Ghosh also submits that there is no explanation\n\nfor such delay save and except some reminders and\n\nrepresentations, which are of no effect or have no\n\nenforceability. Mr. Ghosh also submits the judgement of\n\nthe Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh was delivered\n\non 13th January, 1987 but the writ petitioner did not file\n\nthe writ petition in 1987, he has waited till 1996 i.e. till\n\nafter disposal of the Special Leave Petition as well as\n\nreview petition in 1992. According to Mr. Ghosh the writ\n\npetitioner was sitting on fence and as per the settled\n\nprinciple of law as decided by the Hon'ble Apex Court the\n\nwrit petition should not be retained, when the person who\n\ninstead of challenging the impugned action, sat on fence\n\nand only after the other person claiming some benefit\n\nhaving been successful, have filed or instituted the present\n\nproceeding.\n\nMr. Ghosh submits that there are several\n\njudgements in this regard. He also submits there is nine\n\nJudges' Bench Supreme Court judgement delivered in case\nof Mafatlal wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court have decided,\n\nthe writ petition filed by a person who sitting on fence is\n\nnot entertainable after a long gap.\n\nMr. Ghosh further submits that the officers who took\n\nover charges over small branches or sub-branches got\n\ntheir branches upgraded to the higher cadre for\n\nrecognition for their initiative, hard work and performance\n\nand became eligible for higher allowance and pay scale\n\nwhereas the writ petitioner's case is different specially\n\nwhen the petitioner's working in a sub-office could not\n\nupgrade the status to a branch office cadre. Accordingly,\n\nhe is also not entitled to get the benefit.\n\nMr. Ghosh produced a chart showing the difference\n\nbetween S. Sainathan and P.K. Sharma, the petitioner. The\n\nchart reads as follows :-\n\nA comparison between P.K. Sharma and S. Sainathan\nP.K. Sharma\n19.09.1977 - Appointed by New Bank of India Ltd. as\nManager on probation at Sub office in Scale\n400-1020 (P.27)\n01.06.1979 - Confirmed Manager in Scale 400-1020\n(P.30)\n15.04.1981 - New Bank of India Ltd. was nationalized.\n01.01.1983 - Officers Service Regulations brought into\noperation. Sharma opted for new scales\n(P 109). He was categorized in JM Scale I\n(P5) as he was in Scale 400-1020 (p.4) in\naccordance with\nRegulation 7\n(p.32) and\nplaced in the seniority list of that scale\n(p.110)\nN.B.\nRegulation 7\nis at P. 133.\n\nMarch 1985 - Promotions made from JM Scale I\n1990-1991 to MM Scale II (p.110)\n1990-1991 - Sharma participated in promotion process\nand was promoted to MM Scale II (p.78).\n\nS. Sainathan\n01.01.1975 - Sl. No.256 appointed as Accounts Officer.\n14.07.1977 - Appointed as Accounts Officer in New Bank\nof India Ltd. (P.40) This was equivalent to\nJM Grade I (P.135,136)\n03.02.1981 - Selected for post of MM2(PP50,53,57,40,41)\n25.02.1981 - Sl. No. 256 Selected for post of MM2 (p.41)\n13.01.1984 - Seniority List of MM2 published Showing\nSainathan below Sc. No.256\nAccording to Mr. Ghosh, under no circumstances the\n\nwrit petitioner is entitled to claim similarity with the other\n\nemployee, S. Sainathan who has become successful by the\n\norder of Hon'ble Supreme Court, otherwise also he is not\n\nentitled to get any such benefit specially when he has\n\nwaived his right to such seniority and fixation of pay scale\n\nwithout challenging probation of promotion list in 1984\n\nand also thereafter accepting his promotion finalised\n\nthrough selection process in 1991 and moreover, waiting\n\nfor a long time without challenging the impugned actions\nfor about 13 years.\n\nMr. Ghosh cited few judgements in support of his\n\ncontention. He has cited the Appeal Court judgement\n\ndelivered by Radhuvir, J. and laid stress on the following\n\nparagraph :-\n\n\" The writ petitioner S.Sainathan was an Accounts Officer\nappointed on July 14, 1977. He seeks he be placed above\nS.No.256 in the list of seniority published on January 13,\n1984 relevant to MM2. Serial No.256 was appointed to the\npost of Accounts Officer on January 1, 1975. There was a\nselection held for the post of MM2 on February 3, 1981 in\nwhich Serial No.256 did not appear. Sainathan appeared\nand was selected. Serial No.256 was selected on\nFebruary 25, 1981. On the above facts, under Clause 5\nof\nRegulation 18\nof New Bank of India Officers Service\nRegulation shall affect the seniority among themselves of\nthe officers as existing immediately prior to the appointed\ndate. Sainathan was directed to be placed above\nSl.No.256 in the seniority list of January 13, 1984. Such\na conclusion reached, is assailed by the Bank in this\nappeal.\n\nThe learned counsel for the Bank at first argued\nSainathan could have made a representation to the\nAppellate Authority constituted to consider the dispute,\ntherefore, he should not be permitted to approach this\nCourt. It may not be necessary to consider this aspect for\nit is represented the Committee was formed in January,\n1986. The writ petition was filed earlier to that date.\n\nThe learned counsel for the bank next argued\nseniority under the Regulations of 1982 is determined\nwith reference to scale of pay, therefore, what is ordered\nto the Bank is contrary to the Regulations of 1982. The\nselections referred to are earlier to the enforcement of\nregulations. Since Sainathan was selected on February 3,\n1981, it cannot be he will be junior to Sl.No. 256 selected\non February 25, 1981.\n\nWe, therefore, see no reason to interfere with the\norder under appeal. The direction for implementation is\nextended by four weeks from today.\n\nWrit appeal is dismissed at admission stage.\"\n\nMr. Ghosh then cited another judgement reported in\n\nA.I.R. 1970 S.C. 470 (\nRabindra Nath Bose and others Vs.\n\nUnion of India and others\n). Paragraph 36 of that\n\njudgement reads as follows :-\n\n\"36. Learned Counsel for the petitioners, however, says\nthat there has been no undue delay. He says that the\nrepresentations were being received by the Government\nall the time. But there is a limit to the time which can be\nconsidered reasonable for making representations. If the\nGovernment has turned down one representation, the\nmaking of another representation on similar lines would\nnot enable the petitioners to explain the delay. Learned\ncounsel for the petitioners says that the petitioners were\nunder the impression that the Departmental Promotion\nCommittee had held a meeting in 1948 and not on April\n29, 1949, and the real true facts came to be known in\n1961, when the Government mentioned these facts in\ntheir letter dated December 28, 1961. We are unable to\naccept this explanation. This fact has been mentioned in\nthe minutes of the meeting of the Committee which met in\nFebruary 1952 and we are unable to believe that the\npetitioners did not come to know all these facts till 1961.\nBut even assuming that the petitioners came to know all\nthese facts only in December 1961, even then there has\nbeen inordinate delay in presenting the present petition.\nThe fact that Jaisinghani's case, 1967-2 SCR 703 = (AIR\n1967 SC 1427) was pending before the High Court and\nlater in this Court is also no excuse for the delay in\npresenting the present petition. In the result, the petition\nfails and is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.\"\n\nMr. Ghosh then cited a decision reported in A.I.R.\n\n1989 S.C. 690 (Union of India and others Vs. M/s. Suksha\n\nInternational and M/s. Nutan Gems and another).\n\nParagraph 11 of the aforementioned judgement as referred\n\nby Mr. Ghosh reads as follows :-\n\n\"11. Shri Subba Rao would say that the reference in\nthe order by learned single Judge to the contention on the\npoint of delay as bar to relief had nothing to9 do with the\nspecific contention of the appellants that there was\ninordinate and unexplained delay in approaching the\nCourt. This learned counsel submits, would be clear, by\na reference to the aspect of the delay dealt with and\nconsidered in W.P. 2477 of 1984, on which the learned\nsingle Judge relied. The order of the same learned single\nJudge in W.P. 2477 of 1984, in which the particular\naspect of delay is considered is at para 8 of that order.\nThat para in the order in W.P. 2477 of 1984 reads :\n\n'Mr. Joshi, learned counsel for the respondents,\nsubmitted that the petitioners were not entitled\nto relief because of delay. It is not possible to\nagree. After the redemption certificate of 16th\nNovember, 1983, application for revalidation\nand OGL endorsement was made within four\nmonths therefrom on 12th March, 1984. There\nis, in the circumstances, no such delay as to\nwarrant its rejection on that ground. The\ncontention thus fails and is rejected.' \"\n\nMr. Ghosh also referred another judgement cited in\n\nA.I.R.1989 S.C. 2082 (\nT.R. Kapoor and others Vs. State of\n\nHaryana and others\n). The relevant portion of the\n\njudgement which was referred by Mr. Ghosh reads as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\" Held that the petitioners had acquiesced in the\ninterpretation of the Rules by the State Government all\nalong and it was only after the decision of the Supreme\nCourt disapproving the interpretation placed by the State\non the Rules they chose to move the Supreme Court\nunder\nArt. 32\nof the Constitution to seek promotional\nbenefits. Having remained complacent for a long number\nof years, the petitioners cannot now turn round and say\nthat notwithstanding their inaction, they should be\ngranted promotion from deemed dates on the basis of\nseniority.\"\n\nThe other judgement cited by Mr. Ghosh is reported\n\nin (2010) 7 S.C.C. 525 (Maresh Kumar Vs. Department of\n\nAtomic Energy and others). Paragraph 15 of the said\n\njudgement reads as follows :-\n\n\"15. Merely because the case of the appellant was\nforwarded by the Department vide its Letter dated 27-1-\n2007 for favourable consideration, would not vest any\nright in the petitioner and can hardly be of any materials\nconsequence. If an employee keeps making representation\nafter representation which are consistently rejected then\nthe appellant cannot claim any relief on that ground. We\nare unable to find any merit in the contention raised\nbefore us and we are also of the view that the High Court\nwas not in error while dismissing the writ petition even on\nthe ground of unexplained delay and laches. The\nrepresentation of the appellant was rejected as back in\nthe year 1999 and for the reasons best known to the\nappellant he did not challenge the same before the court\nof competent jurisdiction.\"\n\nMr. Ghosh also cited the decision of the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt reported in (2006) 4 S.C.C. 327 (\nKerala Samsthana\n\nChethu Thozhilali Union Vs. State of Kerala and others\n).\n\nRelevant paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 read as follows :-\n\n\"8. It would be appropriate to note certain decisions\nof this Court in which this aspect has been dealt with in\nrelation to\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution. It is apparent\nthat what has been stated as regards that article would\napply, a fortiori, to\nArticle 226.\nIt was observed in\n\nRabindranath Bose v. Union of India\nthat no relief can be\ngiven to the petitioner who without any reasonable\nexplanation approaches this Court under\nArticle 32\nafter\ninordinate delay. It was stated that though\nArticle 32\nis\nitself a guaranteed right, it does not follow from this that\nit was the intention of the Constitution-makers that this\nCourt should disregard all principles and grant relief in\npetitions filed after inordinate delay.\n\n9. It was stated in\nState of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal\n\nthat the High Court in exercise of its discretion\ndoes not ordinarily assist the tardy and the\nindolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic. If\nthere is inordinate delay on the part of the\npetitioner and such delay is not satisfactorily\nexplained, the High Court may decline to\nintervene and grant relief in exercise of its writ\njurisdiction. It was stated that this rule is\npremised on a number of factors. The High Court\ndoes not ordinarily permit a belated resort to the\nextraordinary remedy because it is likely to cause\nconfusion and public inconvenience and bring, in\nits train new injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is\nexercised after unreasonable delay, it may have\nthe effect of inflicting not only hardship and\ninconvenience but also injustice on third parties.\nIt was pointed out that when writ jurisdiction is\ninvoked, unexplained delay coupled with the\ncreation of third-party rights in the meantime is\nan important factor which also weighs with the\nHigh Court in deciding whether or not to exercise\nsuch jurisdiction.\n\n10. It has been pointed out by this Court in a number\nof cases that representations would not be\nadequate explanation to take care of delay. This\nwas first stated in K.V. Rajalakshmiah Setty v.\n\nState of Mysore. This was reiterated in\n\nRabindranath Bose\ncase by stating that there is a\nlimit to the time which can be considered\nreasonable for making representations and if the\ngovernment had turned down one representation\nthe making of another representation on similar\nlines will not explain the delay.\n\nIn\nState of Orissa\nv. Pyarimohan Samantaray\nmaking of repeated\nrepresentations was not regarded as satisfactory\nexplanation of the delay. In that case the petition\nhad been dismissed for delay alone.\"\n\nThe last judgement cited by Mr. Ghose is A.I.R. 1974\n\nS.C. 2271 (\nP.S. Sadasivaswamy Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n).\n\nThe relevant passage placed by Mr. Ghose reads as\n\nfollows :-\n\n\" Brief Note :- (A) Where a Government servant slept\nover the promotions of his juniors over his head for\nfourteen years and then approached the High Court with\nwrit petition challenging the relaxation of relevant rules in\nfavour of the juniors, the writ petition is liable to be\ndismissed in limine. Such an aggrieved person should\napproach the Court at least within six months or at the\nmost a year of promotion of his juniors.\n\nIt is not that there is any period of limitation for\nthe Courts to exercise their powers under\nArt. 226\n, nor is\nit that there can never be a case where the Courts cannot\ninterfere in a matter after the passage of a certain length\nof time. But it would be a sound and wise exercise of\ndiscretion for the Courts to refuse to exercise their\nextraordinary powers under\nArt. 226\nin the case of\npersons who do not approach it expeditiously for relief and\nwho stand by and allow things to happen and then\napproach the Court to put forward stale claims and try to\nunsettle settled matters. Decision in W.P. and Appeal\n(Mad.) ...... \".\n\nI have carefully considered the submissions made by\n\nthe learned Counsel appearing for the respective parties as\nwell as the materials available on record. It appears from\n\nrecords that the writ petitioner was appointed as Manager\n\non probation at sub-office in scale of 400-1020/- on 19th\n\nSeptembers, 1977. He was confirmed after about two\n\nyears i.e. on 1st June, 1979 in the scale of Rs.400-1020/-.\n\nIn view of Bank Nationalization Act, the respondent, the\n\nNew Bank of India, the employer of the writ petitioner, was\n\nalso nationalised on 15th April, 1981. Officers Service\n\nRegulations brought into operation on and from 1st\n\nJanuary, 1983. Categorisation was made pursuant to such\n\nregulation and the writ petitioner was categorised in\n\nJunior Management Group Scale-I and placed in the\n\nseniority list on that scale. The petitioner made\n\nrepresentation in July 25, 1983 against Categorisation.\n\nThe concerned respondent thereafter prepared the\n\nseniority list on 1st January, 1994. The respondent also\n\ndid not allow the writ petitioner to participate in the\n\npromotion process held in March, 1985 but the writ\n\npetitioner did not question the same before any court of\n\nlaw rather he made another representation in June 24,\n\n1984. Thereafter, again he made appeal for fitment in\n\nMiddle Management Group Scale-II on 1st July, 1987.\n\nHowever, the respondent authorities issued a letter of\nrefusal on 19th February, 1990. The writ petitioner then\n\nalso remained silent. Thereafter, the selection process was\n\nheld for giving promotion and on the basis of invitation of\n\nthe respondent authorities the writ petitioner participated\n\nin the promotion process from Junior Management Group\n\nScale-I to Middle Management Group Scale-II and he was\n\nselected and he got promotion as well as grade to Middle\n\nManagement Group Scale-II. Thereafter, he once again\n\nmade an appeal before the higher authorities i.e. before the\n\nChairman and the Managing Director on October 31, 1992\n\nand the respondent Bank replied to the representation of\n\nthe writ petitioner stating therein the reply dated 9th\n\nNovember, 1992 that against the decision of Sainathan\n\nthey have preferred a review application before the Hon'ble\n\nApex Court which is pending. Therefore, the case cannot\n\nbe considered at that stage. The review application was\n\nagain rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 5th March,\n\n1993 and the writ petitioner asked the concerned\n\nrespondent to reconsider his case. However, the writ\n\npetitioner at that stage even did not come up before the\n\nHon'ble Court questioning the action on the side of the\n\nrespondent. The writ petitioner thereafter again made\n\nrepresentation and has waited till January, 1996 and only\nin February, 1996 filed this writ petition claiming seniority\n\nand gradation with effect from 19th September, 1977 on\n\nthe basis of the decision of S. Sainathan. Although\n\nSainathan's case was decided by Andhra Pradesh High\n\nCourt in 1987 the writ petitioner also did not question the\n\naction of the respondent authorities after 1987. In this\n\nway the writ petitioner continued in the promotional post\n\nand got all subsequent benefits on that basis and in fact,\n\nretired from service after completion of the entire service\n\ntenure. It appears from the aforementioned action that the\n\ncause of action in fact arose in 1984 when he was not\n\ncalled for participation in promotion process and when his\n\nseniority list was prepared in the category of Junior Group\n\nScale-I. He also did not come up and question the same in\n\n1987. The learned Single Judge delivered in 1987 in\n\nSainathan's case. The writ petitioner also did not come\n\nand question the action of the respondent authorities on\n\nthe basis of the said judgement. He waited for a long\n\nthirteen years till before February, 1996. There is no\n\nacceptable explanation for the delay in the writ petition.\n\nFurther making repeated representations without taking\n\nany legal action in appropriate time, is not at all an\n\nexplanation for the delay. In case of Naresh Kumar (supra)\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court have clearly held that if an\n\nemployee keeps making representation after representation\n\nwhich are consistently rejected then the appellant cannot\n\nclaim any relief on that ground and the Hon'ble Apex\n\nCourt refused to grant any relief in favour of the aggrieved\n\nparty.\nIn case of\nKeralasamsthana Chethu Thozhilali\n\nUnion\n(supra) it was held if the writ jurisdiction is\n\nexercised after unreasonable delay, it may have the effect\n\nof inflicting not only hardship and inconvenience but also\n\ninjustice on third parties. It was also pointed out that\n\nwhen the writ jurisdiction is invoked, unexplained delay\n\ncoupled with the creation of third-party rights in the\n\nmeantime is an important factor which also weighs with\n\nthe High Court in deciding whether or not to exercise such\n\njurisdiction.\n\nIn my view, the writ petitioner went on making\n\nrepresentation one after another and at the same time has\n\naccepted the categorisation in Junior Management Group\n\nScale-I and also accepted promotion given by the\n\nrespondent-Bank in 1991 and continued till the date of\n\nretirement. Only after a lapse of 13 years he made this\n\nwrit petition taking a plea of similar status with Sainathan\n\nand claimed relief with effect from 1977. In my view, the\nwrit petitioner suffers inordinate unexplained delay.\n\nTherefore, the writ petition is not maintainable.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that after the refusal of\n\nconsideration of representation in 1990 the writ petitioner\n\nat the call of the respondent authorities appeared at the\n\npromotional process and having been selected accepted\n\nsuch promotion with effect from 1991. Although he has\n\nmade some representations thereafter but it appears that\n\nhe has waived all his rights by accepting such promotion\n\nand also by not questioning the impugned action in 1984\n\nwhen the promotional list was prepared and thereafter in\n\n1987 when the judgement was delivered in case of\n\nSainathan and thereafter when the process of selection\n\nstarted in 1991 for giving promotion.\n\nIn that view of the matter the writ petitioner loses his\n\nclaim to have any benefit on and from 1977.\n\nOn the point of similarity in status and claiming\n\nsimilar benefits as was given to Sainathan is concerned,\n\nfrom a bare perusal of the writ petition as well as reply, the\n\nwrit petitioner could not explain before this Court in what\n\nmanner he is similarly situated. However, an argument\n\nwas advanced that the writ petitioner is similarly situated\n\nlike S. Sainathan but the comparison between\nS.\nSainathan and P.K. Sharma as submitted by Mr. Ghosh\n\nmakes some difference and distinction between them.\n\nTherefore, on that score also the writ petitioner is not\n\nentitled to get any benefit. Otherwise also it appears that\n\non similar ground some other employees moved an\n\napplication under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution before the\n\nHon'ble Apex Court to have the same benefit which was\n\ndismissed by the Hon'ble Apex Court. There is other\n\nproceeding also which was initiated by some other\n\nemployees before Punjab and Haryana High Court, which\n\nwas although allowed by the learned Single Judge but\n\nsubsequently the order of the learned Single Judge was set\n\naside and the writ petition was dismissed.\n\nIn view of my aforementioned findings this writ\n\npetition must fail. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed.\n\nHowever, there would be no order as to costs.\n\nUrgent photostat certified copy of this order, if\n\napplied for, be furnished to the appearing parties on\n\npriority basis.\n\n(Ashoke Kumar Dasadhikari, J.)",
