The petitioner contends that he was appointed on\n\n14.03.1973 by the respondent No.1 in the cadre of Clerk-\n\nGradeII/C.N Ex. Grade II. His appointment was confirmed on\n\n01.01.1977. He was thereafter granted promotion to higher\n\ngrades. From 07.08.1997, he was promoted as a Staff Officer,\n\na Grade 'A' post and was transferred from Mumbai to\n\nBengaluru.\n\n2.1 The petitioner claimed that the respondent No.1\n\nhad established a new entity called the Discount and Finance\n\nHouse of India Limited (henceforth referred to as 'DFHI' in\n\nshort) on 08.03.1988. The majority of its shares was held by\n\nthe respondent No.1 and other Public Sector Banks while the\n\nremaining shares were held by all India financial institutions.\n\nDFHI was recognized as a subsidiary of RBI and a deemed\n\nGovernment Company under\nSection 619B\nof the Companies\n\nAct, 1956. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of DFHI\n\nused to be a Deputy Governor of RBI who invariably was a\n\nmember of the Central Board of Directors of RBI. The objective\n\nof DFHI inter alia was to develop a market for money market\n\n-6-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\ninstruments and as a primary dealer creating infrastructure in\n\nthe Government security markets. It was to ensure\n\ndevelopment of underwriting and market making capabilities\n\nfor Government Sector entities, improving secondary market\n\ntrading system and making primary dealer an effective conduit\n\nfor conducting open market operations. Before the\n\nestablishment of DFHI, some of the above functions were\n\nmanaged by the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI' for short).\n\n2.2 It is claimed that DFHI was owned and controlled by\n\nRBI and most of the officers of RBI were deputed as officers in\n\nDFHI. Likewise, the petitioner was deputed for a period of two\n\nyears at the branch of DFHI at Bengaluru when it was opened\n\nin February 1991, in terms of an order dated 09.02.1991. The\n\npetitioner completed two years deputation in DFHI and his\n\ndeputation was continued till 07.06.1995.\n\n2.3 Later, the RBI started divesting its shares in DFHI\n\nand transferred majority of its stake to the respondent No.2 -\n\nState Bank of India ('SBI' for brevity) and its associate banks\n\nand other nationalized banks and all India financial institutions\n\nwhere respondent No.2 was holding majority shares.\n\n-7-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\n2.4 The petitioner contends that the process of\n\nabsorption of officers/staff deputed from RBI to DFHI started\n\nsome time during 1992 and by the end of 1995, there were 15\n\nsuch officers / staff absorbed into the service of DFHI. The\n\npetitioner was also offered by RBI on 08.05.1995, an option to\n\nbe absorbed in DFHI. He was issued with a letter containing\n\nthe terms of absorption. The petitioner accepted the offer\n\nagreeing to the terms mentioned in the letter dated\n\n08.05.1995. Accordingly, he was absorbed into DFHI on\n\n08.06.1995 after taking voluntary retirement from the RBI on\n\n07.06.1995.\n\n2.5 He contends that the letter offering absorption was\n\nsubject to the terms and conditions mentioned in an annexed\n\ndocument which contained clauses 1 to 19. Each of these\n\nclauses related to a specific and independent subject. He\n\nclaims that the scales of pay and grades are separately\n\nindicated in paragraph No.2 of the letter and has to be read\n\nindependently, without reference to paragraph No.1 of the\n\nletter and clause Nos.1 to 19 in the annexure. As per paragraph\n\nNo.2 of the letter, the scales of pay in DFHI would be on par\n\nwith the pay scales and grades in the RBI. Therefore, the\n\n-8-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\npetitioner contends that he was assured of a pay scale and\n\ngrade in DFHI that would be in line with the pay scale and\n\ngrade in the RBI not only at the time of absorption but till he\n\nretired from service. He contends that at the time of absorption\n\nin DFHI, he held the post of officer in Grade 'A' / Assistant\n\nManager post in RBI. As per the terms of the 3rd paragraph of\n\nthe letter of offer, he obtained voluntary retirement from RBI\n\non 07.06.1995 and was absorbed into DFHI on 08.06.1995. He\n\nwas placed at a pay of Rs.4,800/- in the post of officer in Grade\n\n'A'/Assistant Manager since the petitioner was obtaining pay\n\nscales and allowances as per the old revision effective from\n\n01.11.1987 in the RBI.\n\n2.6 He contends that the revision of pay scales and\n\nallowances was due from 01.11.1992 and the same was\n\ngranted by the RBI vide its Circular No.5 dated 20.11.1995 with\n\nretrospective effect from 01.11.1992. Since the petitioner was\n\nabsorbed into DFHI on 08.06.1995, the respondent No.1 had to\n\ncalculate the revised pay and allowances of the petitioner from\n\n01.11.1992 to 07.06.1995. Accordingly, the petitioner was paid\n\nthe arrears by RBI while DFHI paid the revised pay scales and\n\nallowances in Grade 'A' from 08.06.1995 as promised under the\n\n-9-\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\noffer letter. He was fitted in the pay at Rs.9650/- as on\n\n08.06.1995 which was the maximum pay scale of Grade 'A'\n\nofficer in the RBI effective from 01.11.1992. Since the\n\npetitioner reached the maximum in the pay scale of an officer\n\nin Grade 'A' in the RBI, he was given increment in the pay\n\nscales of combined Grade 'B' and 'C' as an incentive for\n\nagreeing to be absorbed in DFHI and later fixing his pay scales\n\nin line with that obtaining in the RBI for an officer Grade 'C'\n\neffective from 01.11.1997.\n\n2.7 The petitioner was thereafter upgraded to the post\n\nof officer in Grade 'C' / Vice President which is equivalent to the\n\npost of Officer in Grade 'C' / Assistant General Manager in the\n\nRBI. He contends that DFHI issued a letter dated 17.07.2000\n\nrevising the pay scales and allowances for a period of five years\n\nand with retrospective effect from 01.01.1999 and the\n\npetitioner was placed in the pay scale Rs.12300-375-13050-\n\n400-13850-425-17250-EB-425-19375 and his basic pay was\n\nre-fixed at Rs.17,250/- and allowances were also re-fixed.\n\n2.8 He contends that the age of superannuation in the\n\nbanking sector was 58 years when the petitioner accepted the\n\n- 10 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\noffer to be absorbed in DFHI. Thereafter the Rule relating to\n\nsuperannuation was changed in the banking industry extending\n\nservice up to 60 years of age. Respondent No.1 brought similar\n\nRules in the year 1998 and DFHI also incorporated similar\n\nprovisions in DFHI (Staff) Amendment Rules, 1998 vide office\n\norder dated 28.12.1998. As a result, respondent No.1\n\ntransferred its portion of gratuity to the respondent No.3\n\nconsidering the age of retirement of the petitioner as 60 years\n\nas was done in the case of the other absorbed officers.\n\n2.9 The petitioner contends that the pay scales and\n\nallowances are revised in the RBI once in five years and are\n\nmade effective from the first day of November of the particular\n\nyear. Accordingly, the RBI issued Circular No.9 dated\n\n01.01.2001 for revision of pay scales and allowances of officers\n\nwith retrospective effect from 01.11.1997. When the aforesaid\n\nCircular as issued, the pay scale and the allowances of the\n\npetitioner were already in line though not equal to the Grade 'C'\n\nemployees in the RBI. However, for nearly 1 year 2 months\n\ni.e., from 01.11.1997 to 31.12.1998, respondent No.3 did not\n\nreset the pay and allowances of the petitioner in line with the\n\nGrade 'C' officers in the RBI.\n\n- 11 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\n2.10 He contends that his pay of Rs.18,525/- in March\n\n2002 was in line with the pay of an officer in Grade 'C' in the\n\nRBI which included the maximum sum of Rs.16,900/- in the\n\npay scale plus a special pay of Rs.475/- and two stagnation\n\nincrements of Rs.475/- each. Thereafter, DFHI issued another\n\nrevision of pay scales and allowances in terms of an order\n\ndated 11.04.2002 revising the pay scales of the employees in\n\nDFHI with retrospective effect from 01.04.2002. As a result,\n\nthe petitioner was placed in the pay scale of Rs.13500-400-\n\n15500-450-17750-500-20750. His basic pay was fixed at\n\nRs.20,250/- and the allowances were correspondingly revised.\n\nThe respondent No.3 increased the House Rent Allowance\n\n(HRA) effective from April 2002 to those officials not availing\n\nresidential accommodation from the Company.\n\n2.11 The petitioner contends that with the complete\n\ndivesting of shares in DFHI by the RBI in March 2002, the\n\nrespondent No.2 acquired more than 50% of shares in DFHI\n\nand therefore, it became a subsidiary of SBI in March 2003.\n\nSimilarly, another subsidiary of SBI named SBI Gilts Limited\n\nmerged with DFHI in the year 2004 under a scheme of\n\namalgamation which was duly approved by the High Court of\n\n- 12 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nBombay. The DFHI was subsequently renamed as respondent\n\nNo.3 and a fresh certificate of incorporation was issued.\n\n2.12 The petitioner contends that the RBI issued a\n\nCircular No.10 dated 21.11.2005 revising the pay scales and\n\nallowances of the officers in the RBI with retrospective effect\n\nfrom 01.11.2002. It is contended that when the RBI issued the\n\naforesaid circular, the pay scale and allowances of the\n\npetitioner were significantly lower than that was granted in the\n\nRBI for Grade 'C' effective from 01.11.2002. Therefore, there\n\nwas a need for resetting the pay scale and allowances of the\n\npetitioner in the respondent No.3 so that it is in line with that of\n\na Grade 'C' officer in the RBI.\n\n2.13 He contends that the respondent No.3 had a good\n\nrecord of profit after tax. He claimed that for the years 2008-\n\n09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13, it had the profit\n\nof Rs.66.95 crores, Rs.89.23 crores, Rs.56.94 crores, Rs.43.51\n\ncrores and Rs.80.29 crores respectively. He contends that\n\nbeing aggrieved by the significantly lower pay and allowances\n\ngiven to him when compared to the pay and allowances given\n\nto Grade 'C' officer in RBI, the petitioner submitted a\n\n- 13 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nrepresentation dated 02.09.2006 to the respondent No.4 to\n\nreset his pay and allowances. However, the same was not\n\ndone.\n\n2.14 He contends that for nearly 5 years and 2 months\n\ni.e., from 01.11.2002 to 31.12.2007, his pay and allowances\n\nwere not in line with that of an officer in Grade 'C' in the RBI.\n\nTherefore, he contends that the respondent No.3 has violated\n\nthe terms of absorption. He contends that the respondent No.3\n\nissued a letter dated 24.01.2008 revising the pay scales and\n\nallowances with retrospective effect from 01.01.2008 and the\n\nbasic pay of the petitioner was fixed at Rs.23,520/- and other\n\nadmissible allowances were also revised.\n\n2.15 The petitioner contends that in the year 1998, DFHI\n\namended Rule No.16 of the DFHI (Staff) Rules, 1995 (for\n\nshort, 'the Rules, 1995') vide an office order dated 28.12.1998\n\nenhancing the age of superannuation from 58 to 60 years with\n\neffect from 01.12.1998.\n\n2.16 He contends that on he attaining 58 years on\n\n31.07.2010, he was asked to retire from service under the then\n\nprevalent SBI DFHI Limited Staff Service Rules, 2007 (for\n\n- 14 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nshort, 'the Rules, 2007'). The petitioner therefore dissatisfied\n\nwith the discriminatory treatment meted out to him, submitted\n\na representation dated 30.06.2010 requesting the respondent\n\nNo.4 to extend him the benefit of extended superannuation age\n\nof retirement. The respondent No.4 rejected the request of the\n\npetitioner by his communication dated 12.07.2010. The\n\npetitioner thereafter submitted a detailed representation dated\n\n19.07.2010 before the respondent No.3 requesting it to extend\n\nthe age of retirement. Nonetheless, the petitioner was retired\n\nfrom service on 31.07.2010, even before receiving any reply\n\nfrom the respondent No.3. The respondent No.3 then rejected\n\nthe appeal of the petitioner by a communication / order dated\n\n05.08.2010 without assigning any reason.\n\n2.17 The petitioner contends that he had worked for\n\nnearly 22 years and 3 months in the RBI and for 15 years 1\n\nmonth in respondent No.3.\n\n2.18 He contends that respondent No.1 issued the\n\nCircular No.4 dated 09.09.2010 revising the pay scales and\n\nallowances of officers in the RBI with retrospective effect from\n\n01.11.2007. He contends that though the respondent No.3 vide\n\n- 15 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nletter dated 24.01.2008 had revised the pay scales and\n\nallowances with effect from 01.01.2008, the same was not in\n\nline with the pay of a Grade 'C' officer in the RBI. The\n\npetitioner on coming to know of the circular dated 09.09.2010\n\nsubmitted a representation dated 18.01.2011 to the respondent\n\nNo.4 explaining the injustice meted out to him in not resetting\n\nhis pay and allowance and also referring to the difference in\n\npay scales. The respondent No.4 rejected the claim of the\n\npetitioner vide letter dated 16.07.2011. The petitioner\n\nsubmitted a detailed appeal dated 22.08.2011 before the\n\nrespondent No.3. The respondent No.3 by a communication\n\ndated 30.01.2012, rejected the claim of the petitioner and\n\naffirmed the order of the respondent No.4.\n\n2.19 The petitioner again submitted a representation\n\ndated 25.04.2012 requesting the respondent No.1 to look into\n\nhis grievance regarding the violation of the terms of the letter\n\nof offer dated 08.05.1995. The respondent No.1 erroneously\n\ninterpreting the second paragraph of the letter dated\n\n08.05.1995 and clause 10 of the annexure to the offer letter,\n\nadvised the petitioner to approach the respondent No.3 by its\n\ncommunication dated 04.06.2012. Therefore the petitioner\n\n- 16 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nsubmitted representation dated 03.09.2012 to the Executive\n\nDirector (Administration) of the RBI and another representation\n\ndated 07.03.2013 to the Hon'ble Governor of the RBI. The\n\npetitioner did not receive any affirmative action from the\n\nrespondent No.1 though he received replies from the other\n\nauthorities on 09.12.2012 and 25.04.2013.\n\n2.20 The petitioner again submitted representation dated\n\n18.06.2013 to the Central Board of Directors of the RBI to\n\nintervene and secure the relief to the petitioner. However, the\n\nDeputy Governor (HRK) of the RBI instructed the Executive\n\nDirector (RG) of the RBI to speak with the respondent No.3\n\ninformally and impress upon it for payment of some\n\ncompensation. Accordingly, an office note was recorded and\n\ninstruction was complied in July 2013.\n\n2.21 However, by a communication dated 02.08.2013\n\nissued by the Assistant General Manager of RBI, he was again\n\nadvised to approach the respondent No.3. He contends that\n\nsince he did not receive any response from the respondent\n\nNo.3, he submitted another representation to it and to the\n\nrespondent No.1 on 16.09.2013. He claimed that there was no\n\n- 17 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nresponse from the respondent Nos.1 and 3 which forced him to\n\nfile another detailed representation dated 03.12.2013 with the\n\nrespondent No.2, to intervene in the matter and grant relief to\n\nthe petitioner. The respondent No.3 then issued a\n\ncommunication dated 09.12.2013 denying its liability. The\n\nrespondent No.2 then addressed a communication dated\n\n02.01.2014 to the petitioner referring to the communication of\n\nthe respondent No.3 and declining to intervene in the matter.\n\n2.22 The petitioner then again submitted representations\n\ndated 16.12.2013 and 10.02.2014 to the respondent No.3,\n\ncomprehensively replying to all the earlier communications.\n\nFollowing this, the respondent No.3 replied on 22.02.2014 and\n\n24.02.2014 again declining to entertain the request of the\n\npetitioner. Following this, the respondent No.2 addressed a\n\ncommunication dated 18.03.2014 declining to interfere in the\n\nmatter. The petitioner is therefore before this Court seeking the\n\naforesaid reliefs.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that\n\nwhen the petitioner was assured of protection of his pay, pay\n\nscale and allowances on his absorption at DFHI, he was entitled\n\n- 18 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nto protection of his pay. He contends that the petitioner was\n\nalso entitled to the revised pay scale and allowances in view of\n\ntime bound revision while he was employed at the respondent\n\nNo.1. He contends that the denial of this benefit is arbitrary\n\nand unconscionable.\n\n4. The writ petition is opposed by the respondent\n\nNos.2, 3 and 4. They contend that as per the offer letter dated\n\n08.05.1995 seeking option of the petitioner for absorption, it\n\nwas stated as follows:\n\n\"Discount & Finance House of India Limited is\nprepared to absorb your services on the terms and\nconditions indicated in the Annexure.\n\n2. The scales of pay in D.F.H.I will be in line with pay\nscales and grades obtaining in Reserve Bank of\nIndia.\n\n3. Before your appointment in D.F.H.I., you will have to\nseek voluntary retirement from the Bank's service\nunder\nRegulation 26(3)\n/\n3(A)\nof the Reserve Bank of\nIndia (Staff) Regulations 1940. The Bank would be\nprepared to waive the required notice period to\nenable you to take up the appointment in D.F.H.I.\"\n\n5. They contend that the terms and conditions for such\n\nabsorption were annexed to the said letter. Condition Nos.6\n\n- 19 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nand 10, which are relevant were referred and the same are\n\nextracted below:\n\n\"6. Superannuation benefits other than pension will\ncontinue to be admissible to the members of the staff\nto the extent as per the existing Rules obtaining in\nthe Reserve Bank of India until such time as the\nDiscount and Finance House of India Limited frames\nits own Scheme. The superannuation age will be 58\nyears except in case of employees in Class IV and it\nwill be 60 years in case of an employee in Class-IV.\"\n\n... ... ...\n\n10. The Reserve Bank of India Staff Regulations will be\napplicable to the members of the staff in respect of\nall matters until such time as the Discount and\nFinance House of India Limited frames its own Rules.\nAs and when the Discount and Finance House of\nIndia Limited Rules are framed they will be applicable\nto all members of the staff.\"\n\nTherefore, they contend that as per the aforesaid terms, a\n\nperson absorbed would be entitled to superannuation benefits\n\nother than pension as is admissible to the members of the staff\n\nas per the existing Rules in the RBI until the DFHI/Company\n\nframes its own scheme. It also mandated that the age of\n\nsuperannuation would be 58 years except in case of employees\n\nin Class-IV who would superannuate at the age of 60 years.\n\n- 20 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nThey contend that after the petitioner submitted his voluntary\n\nretirement from respondent No.1 and was absorbed into the\n\nservices of the DFHI/Company, he was governed by the service\n\nRules of the RBI until the Company framed its own scheme.\n\n6. They contend that after the absorption of the\n\npetitioner on 07.06.1995, the Board of Directors of the\n\nCompany/DFHI in its meeting held on 24.07.1995, resolved as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"Agenda Item No.8\n\nApproval of Staff Regulations and other allied schemes\n\nThe Managing Director informed the members of\nthe Board that it has become necessary for the\nCompany to have its own staff rules/regulations with the\ngradual absorption of most of the staff initially availed\non deputation.\n\nHe further mentioned that the said rules have\nbeen framed by Shri. Y.M.Paranjpe, retired senior officer\nof the Reserve Bank of India keeping in view similar\nrules/schemes followed by Reserve Bank of India and\nthe requirements of various relevant statutes.\n\nAfter discussions, the Board passed the following\nresolution unanimously:\n\n\"RESOLVED THAT the DFHI Staff Rules and Rules\nrelating to Leave Fare Concession, Travelling and Halting\n\n- 21 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nAllowance, Consumer Articles Loan, Vehicle Loan and\nReimbursement of Conveyance Expenses, as circulated\namong the Directors be and are hereby approved.\"\n\n7. They contend that it is evident that the Board of\n\nDirectors of the Company/DFHI felt it necessary that the Staff\n\nRules and Rules relating to leave, fare concession and other\n\nservice benefits were to be approved by circulation amongst\n\nthe Directors in view of similar Rules/Schemes followed by the\n\nrespondent No.1 and most of the employees of the DFHI were\n\neither from SBI or from respondent No.1.\n\n8. They contend that in the year 1997, when pay\n\nrevision was on the anvil, the Managing Director of the\n\nCompany by a memorandum dated 20.02.1997, proposed\n\nrevision of pay of the employees of the Company under an\n\nagenda by de-linking the pay scales of the RBI as applicable to\n\nthe employees who were absorbed on deputation from the RBI\n\nand to adopt the pay scales of the Company from 1997\n\nonwards. The Board dealing with the issue at the meeting held\n\non 05.03.1997 was pleased to approve the proposal in terms of\n\nthe following resolution:\n\n- 22 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\n\"AGENDA ITEM NO.6\n\nProposal for revision of pay of the employees of the\nCompany\n\nThe Board of Directors agreed, in principle, with the\nrecommendations made by the Managing Director of the\nCompany. However, they suggested certain modifications\nwhich are listed below:\n\n1. Marginally revise upward the pay scales of the\nemployees of the Company in different categories and\ncompletely delink these from the pay scales of RBI.\n\n2. Alongside changes in scales, the job contents of\nStenographer(s) and Office Assistants could be\nexpanded and their designations changed to reflect\ntheir movement to a non-workman position.\n\n3. Provision of leased accommodation to officers and\nrationalization/extension of other facilities could be\nexamined keeping in view, among other factors,\nmarket conditions, improvement in productivity and\ncost to the Company.\n\n4. Review and re-designate the various posts in the\nCompany in line with the Company's structure,\nbusiness needs and current market practices.\n\nThe Board authorised the Managing Director to\nfinalise the issues at items (1) and (2) in consultation\nwith the Chairman of the Company and report the matter\nto the Board at its next meeting.\n\n- 23 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nThereafter the following resolution was adopted\nunanimously:\n\n\"RESOLVED THAT the pay and perquisites of the\nemployees in the Company should stand completely\ndelinked from those in RBI and the Managing Director\nof the Company be and is hereby authorized to\nfinalise, in consultation with the Chairman of the\nBoard, revision in the pay scales of employees of the\nCompany at all levels on the lines recommended with\nsome improvements and create positions of Secretary\nand Executive Secretary.\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER THAT THE Managing Director of\nthe Company be and is hereby authorized to incur\nnecessary expenditure pursuant to the proposed\nchanges.\"\n\n9. Therefore, it is contended that the petitioner\n\nbecame an absorbed employee from the respondent No.1 in the\n\nCompany and in terms of Clause 10 of the terms and conditions\n\nfound in Annexure to the offer letter dated 08.05.1995, the\n\npetitioner is bound by the resolution of the Board which dealt\n\nwith the revision of pay scales from time to time. The\n\npetitioner chose not to question the said resolution of the Board\n\nas the pay scale that was made applicable to him was beneficial\n\nthan that was prevalent in the respondent No.1. They contend\n\nthat the petitioner having chosen to keep quiet for 13 years\n\n- 24 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\ncannot now claim pay scales of the RBI on the ground that the\n\nscales of the pay of the employees of the RBI are more\n\nbeneficial to him.\n\n10. They further contend that the respondent No.3 had\n\ninitially revised the pay scales of all the staff with effect from\n\n01.01.1997 as approved by the Board of the Company/DFHI\n\nconsequent to which the salary of the petitioner was also\n\nrevised based on the pay scales approved by the Board of the\n\nCompany and not based on the RBI Service Rules. They\n\ncontend that this revision of salary did not contain any\n\nprovision for payment of salary to ex-RBI staff absorbed in the\n\nCompany as per the RBI Service Rules. They contend that since\n\nthe arrears were paid up to 31.12.1996 on the basis of revision\n\nof pay scales in the RBI, as those Services Rules were\n\napplicable up to 01.01.1997 only. They contend that in the year\n\n2000, when pay scales had to be revised with effect from\n\n01.01.1999, the Board resolved to revise the pay scales in tune\n\nwith the pay scales of the Company and there was no mention\n\nof the revision of pay scales that were prevalent in the RBI or\n\nelsewhere. The relevant portion of the said resolution of the\n\nBoard is extracted below:\n\n- 25 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\n\"AGENDA ITEM NO.17\n\nProposal for pay revision of the employees of DFHI\ndue from January 1, 1999:\n\nThe contents of the Memorandum were noted by the\nBoard. A number of queries were made by the Directors\nseeking clarifications which were provided by the\nManaging Director of the Company to the satisfaction of\nthe Board. The recommendations contained in the\nproposal for pay revision which were made to the Board\nfor its consideration and approval are enumerated below:\n\n1. The effect of pay revision may be given from January\n1, 1999 i.e., immediately after the expiry of the\nprevious wage agreement which expired on\nDecember 31, 1998 and that this agreement will\nremain valid for five years i.e. next agreement will\nfall due on January 1, 2004.\n\n... ... ... ...\"\n\n11. Later in the year 2002, the Company had to revise\n\nthe compensation structure. Therefore, the Board at its\n\nmeeting held on 28.03.2002, resolved to revise the\n\ncompensation structure of the Company independently and not\n\nin tune with the RBI Service Rules. They contend that the\n\nattempt of the petitioner to draw a comparison between the\n\npay scales of the Company and the RBI is ipse dixit and was\n\nnot based on any Service Rules.\n\n- 26 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\n12. They contend that the option for absorption should\n\nbe read holistically and not in fragments. They contend that\n\nthe emphasis of the petitioner on the contents of the letter\n\ndated 08.05.1995 and avoiding reference to the terms and\n\nconditions mentioned in the Annexure to it, was misleading.\n\nThey contend that the option for absorption was clear and\n\nunequivocal and it was made clear that the Rules of RBI could\n\nbe applicable only till such time the Company framed its own\n\nRules. They further contend that DFHI is a non-banking\n\nfinancial Company and therefore, the Rules as applicable to the\n\nBanking industry would not mutatis mutandis apply to a non-\n\nbanking financial Company until the Company specifically\n\napproves such application of the Rules made elsewhere by the\n\nBoard of the Company. They contend that the petitioner joined\n\nthe service of the Company and he continued to draw salary in\n\nline with the salary obtaining in the RBI as the Company was\n\nyet to frame its own Rules. The claim of the petitioner is that\n\nonce the RBI revised the scales of pay and allowances to all the\n\nofficers of the Company, the same is applicable to the\n\nCompany, is based on an administrative Circular dated\n\n01.01.2001 issued by RBI. However, in para No.1 of the said\n\n- 27 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nCircular, it is clearly indicated that it is applicable only to\n\nofficers of the RBI. They contend that the petitioner had sought\n\nvoluntary retirement from the RBI and therefore, he is ceased\n\nto be an employee of the RBI and hence the Circular No.9\n\nissued by the RBI dated 01.01.2001 was not applicable to him.\n\nThey contend that the pay scales of the staff of the Company\n\nwas revised with effect from 01.04.2002 resulting in a\n\ncorresponding revision of the pay scale of the petitioner. They\n\nfurther contend that in the year 2004 i.e., on 19.03.2004, the\n\nHon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay by an order in\n\nterms of\nSection 391\nread with\nSection 394\nof the Companies\n\nAct, 1956, DFHI was amalgamated with SBI Gilts Limited and\n\nall the assets of the Company were transferred to SBI Gilts\n\nLimited. They contend that the Company came to be known as\n\nSBI DFHI Limited from 19.03.2004 and onwards. The Board of\n\nDirectors of respondent No.3 met on 11.01.2007 to determine\n\nthe service conditions of employees who were working in DFHI\n\nand continued to work with SBI DFHI Limited and the Uniform\n\nService Rules were brought with effect from 01.01.2007 which\n\nwere placed before the Board on 11.01.2007. The Board passed\n\nthe following resolution:\n\n- 28 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\n\"AGENDA ITEM NO.7\n\nUniform Service Rules\n\nMemorandum No.7/104/2007 dated December 22, 2006\nregarding Policy for Uniform Service Rules for the\nCompany was placed before the Board.\n\nAfter discussion, the Board -\n\n\"RESOLVED THAT approval be and is hereby given for the\npolicy of Uniform Service Rules of the Company as\ndetailed in the Memorandum No.7/104/2007 dated\nDecember 22, 2006 placed on the table of the meeting\nduly initialed by the Managing Director and Chief\nExecutive Officer and Executive Vice President of the\nCompany for purposes of identification.\"\n\nTherefore, the Uniform Service Rules were made applicable\n\nwith effect from 01.01.2007 to all employees working in\n\nrespondent No.3.\n\n13. They contend that as regards the age of retirement,\n\nSection 4\nof the Uniform Service Rules reads as under:\n\n\"\nSection 4\n- Superannuation and retirement\n\n15.(1) An employee shall retire after completion of 30\nyears of service or 58 years of age whichever\noccurs first, unless extension in service has been\ngranted by the Competent Authority -\n\n- 29 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nProvided that on an employee completing 30\nyears of service or 50 years of age whichever\noccurs first, the case for extension in service or\notherwise will be reviewed at biennial (2 years)\nintervals. Based on the review the Competent\nAuthority may, at his discretion, grant extension of\nservice for a period not exceeding two (2) years at\na time. However, such extension in service shall not\nbe granted beyond 58 years of age being the age of\nretirement\n\n(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in\nsub rule (1) above, the Company may, at its discretion,\nretire an employee at any time after completion of 50\nyears of age.\n\n(3) An employee who attains the age of superannuation\non any day other than the first of a calendar month, shall\nretire on the last day of that month.\n\n(4) An employee who has attained the age of 50 years\nmay voluntarily retire after giving three months' notice in\nwriting to the Competent Authority subject to the\nprovisions of Rules No.14.\n\n(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Rule,\nwhere an employee has balance of leave to the credit of\nhis privilege leave account as on the date of retirement,\nhe may be paid a lumpsum amount which would be\nequivalent of pay as defined in Rule 3(f) of these Rules,\nfor the unavailed privilege leave subject to a maximum of\neight months pay plus dearness allowances in respect\nthereof.\n\n- 30 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nExplanation: \"Date of Retirement\" means the date on\nwhich the employee attains the age of 58 years or the\ndate on which he is retired by SBI DFHI Ltd. under sub-\nrule (1) of this Rule, or the date on which the employee\nvoluntarily retires in terms of sub-rule (4) of this Rule, as\nthe case may be.\"\n\nTherefore the age of retirement in terms of the Rules of\n\nrespondent No.3 is 58 years and the said Uniform Service Rules\n\nare applied uniformly to all employees. Therefore, they\n\ncontend that retiring the petitioner on completing 58 years is\n\nstrictly in accordance with the Service Rules.\n\n14. They contend that after the merger of DFHI with\n\nSBI Gilts, new company, namely, respondent No.3, was formed\n\non 15.06.2004 with retrospective effect from 01.04.2003. In\n\nthe scheme of amalgamation, there was no reference\n\nwhatsoever that the service conditions in RBI could be made\n\napplicable to employees of respondent No.3. They contend that\n\nthe claim of the petitioner that he ought to have been given the\n\nbenefit of the revision of pay scales of RBI on 21.11.2005 with\n\neffect from 01.11.2002 is unacceptable as the petitioner had\n\nvoluntarily retired from RBI on 07.06.1995. The respondents\n\nhave copiously referred to the judgments of the Hon'ble\n\n- 31 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nSurpeme Court in:\nB. Bharat Kumar v. Osmania University\n\n[(2007) 11 SCC 58];\nSureshchandra Singh v. Fertilizer\n\nCorporation of India Limited\n[(2004) 1 SCC 592];\nNaresh\n\nKumar v. Department of Atomic Energy\n[(\n2010) 7 SCC\n\n525] and Karnataka Power Corporation Limited v. K.\n\nThangappan\n[(2006) 4 SCC 322]. They contend that the\n\npetition is also liable to be dismissed as the petitioner had\n\napproached the Court with unclean hands. They contend that\n\nonce the petitioner took voluntary retirement from respondent\n\nNo.1 on 07.06.1995, it would not lie in his mouth to claim that\n\nhe is entitled to the pay scale and the allowances as applicable\n\nto the employees of the RBI. Consequently, they contend that\n\nthe petitioner being governed by the Services Rules of the\n\nrespondent No.3, which superannuates its employees at the\n\nage of 58 years, he cannot contend to the contrary and claim\n\nthat he is entitled to continue in service in respondent No.3 till\n\n60 years.\n\n15. After considering the case of the petitioner and the\n\nrespondent No.3, it is evident that the petitioner has two claims\n\nviz., (i) resetting his pay to bring it on par with the scale of pay\n\n- 32 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nprevalent in the RBI and (ii) extending his age of\n\nsuperannuation till the age of 60 years.\n\n16. It is relevant to note that respondent No.1\n\nestablished DFHI which was a specialised Agency, with an\n\nobjective of developing a market for money market\n\ninstruments, creating infrastructure in the Government\n\nsecurities market etc. This Agency was owned and controlled by\n\nthe respondent No.1, which had deputed officers on its roll to\n\nDFHI for all operations. The petitioner too was one such officer\n\nwho was deputed from respondent No.1 to DFHI on 09.02.1991\n\nfor a period of two years. Therefore, he was governed by the\n\nReserve Bank of India (Staff) Regulations for all purposes\n\nrelating to his service. It is stated that the process of\n\nabsorption of the employees in DFHI was commenced in the\n\nyear 1992, which is not disputed. Later, the respondent No.1\n\ndivested its shares in DFHI and transferred majority of its\n\nshares to respondent No.2 and its Associate Banks and other\n\nnationalised Banks and All India Financial Institutions and since\n\nrespondent No.2 held majority of the shares, DFHI became a\n\nsubsidiary of respondent No.2 and was re-named as respondent\n\nNo.3. It was therefore inevitable for the respondent No.3 to\n\n- 33 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\ndecide the fate of the employees who were deputed from\n\nrespondent No.1. Thus on the initiation of the respondent No.3,\n\nthe process of absorption of the existing employees in DFHI\n\ncommenced which culminated in an offer to the employees of\n\nrespondent No.3 to be absorbed in the respondent No.3. The\n\npetitioner too was offered to be absorbed in respondent No.3 in\n\nterms of a communication of respondent No.1 dated\n\n08.05.1995 on terms and conditions mentioned therein as well\n\nas the terms and conditions mentioned in the annexure to the\n\nletter. The condition precedent for such absorption was that the\n\npetitioner had to submit his voluntary retirement from\n\nrespondent No.1. Accordingly, the petitioner, who perhaps\n\nhoped of a better prospect having regard to the specialised skill\n\nand competence he had acquired in a niche field, opted to be\n\nabsorbed in respondent No.3 as the terms of absorption, did\n\ngive an impression that the service benefits as obtained in\n\nrespondent No.1 would be continued. It was also held out that\n\nthe pay that the petitioner was drawing while in service with\n\nrespondent No.1 would be protected. Therefore, he submitted a\n\nrequest for voluntary retirement from respondent No.1 on\n\n07.06.1995 and he was absorbed into the services of\n\n- 34 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nrespondent No.3 on 08.06.1995. Once the petitioner exercised\n\noption to be absorbed in the respondent No.3, the same was\n\nirrevocable and final and from the date of absorption, he had to\n\nforego all rights and claims relating to service in respondent\n\nNo.1.\n\n17. The letter dated 08.05.1995 provided that the\n\nscales of pay in DFHI would be in line with the pay scales and\n\ngrades obtaining in respondent No.1 and for all other incidents\n\nof service such as accrued superannuation benefits, unavailed\n\nleave fare concession set and unavailed ordinary leave lying to\n\nthe credit of each person, the absorption and consequential\n\nappointment of members of the staff in the DFHI shall be\n\ntreated, virtually, as a transfer of service from the RBI to the\n\nDFHI. Those employees who sought voluntary retirement from\n\nRBI could claim superannuation benefits including encashment\n\nof balance of ordinary leave. They were entitled to continue\n\ntheir membership to the Reserve Bank of India Medical Fund\n\nScheme. The superannuation benefits other than pension was\n\nadmissible to the members of the staff to the extent as per the\n\nexisting Rules obtaining in the RBI until such time as the DFHI\n\nframed its own scheme. Likewise, the RBI Staff Regulations\n\n- 35 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nwould apply to the members of the staff in respect of all\n\nmatters until such time as DFHI framed its own Rules.\n\n18. The petitioner was granted the same scale of pay\n\nthat he was drawing in respondent No.1 on the date of\n\nabsorption. After such absorption, the respondent No.3\n\nresolved at a meeting of the Board on 05.03.1997 to delink the\n\npay scale of its employees from the pay scales of RBI. Later\n\nrespondent No.3 revised the pay scale of the petitioner with\n\neffect from 01.01.1997 in terms of the communication dated\n\n31.03.1997 and placed the petitioner in the scale of Rs.7200-\n\n325-9800-350-10150-EB-350-11200 and his pay was fixed at\n\nRs.10,500/- per month with effect from 01.01.1997. The salary\n\nof Rs.10,500/- per month was paid from April 1997. In respect\n\nof the salary for the period from 08.06.1995 till 31.03.1997,\n\nthe arrears of salary based on the revision of pay scale in\n\nrespondent No.1 was offered to be paid. The revised pay scale\n\nin respondent No.3 after revision was supposedly higher than\n\nthe pay scale in the RBI at that point in time. The respondent\n\nNo.1 issued a Circular dated 01.01.2001 revising the pay scale\n\nof its employees with effect from 01.11.1997. If the pay of the\n\npetitioner in DFHI was not in line with the pay as revised by\n\n- 36 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nrespondent No.1 with effect from 01.11.1997, the respondent\n\nNo.3 ought to have reset the pay to bring it on par.\n\n19. The petitioner has claimed that the pay drawn by\n\nhim in March 2002 was in line with the pay of Rs.18,325/-\n\ndrawn by an officer in Grade 'C' in respondent No.1. Thereafter,\n\nDFHI issued another pay revision vide order dated 11.04.2002\n\nrevising pay scale of the petitioner with effect from 01.04.2002\n\nas a result of which his basic pay stood revised to Rs.20,250/-\n\nper month. This was followed by a pay revision by respondent\n\nNo.1 on 21.11.2005 revising the pay scales with effect from\n\n01.11.2002. The petitioner contends that at this point in time,\n\nthe scale of pay in respondent No.3 was not in line with those\n\nemployees in respondent No.1 and therefore, his scale had to\n\nbe reset to bring it on par.\n\n20. It is relevant to note that the petitioner had the\n\noption to go back to RBI but he opted to be absorbed in DFHI\n\nas the offer of absorption was subject to same service\n\nconditions, scale of pay as was obtained in respondent No.1. It\n\nis quite obvious that the petitioner could not be expected to\n\naccept something less than what he would have otherwise got.\n\n- 37 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nTherefore, even if the DFHI had delinked the pay and\n\nperquisites of its employees from the pay and perquisites of\n\nemployees in respondent No.1, that did not mean that the\n\npetitioner could be deprived of the benefit that he would have\n\ngot, had he continued in respondent No.1. It was therefore\n\nincumbent upon the respondent No.3 to ensure that the pay\n\nscale of the petitioner was refitted to bring it on par with the\n\nscale of pay extended to the employees in the respondent No.1.\n\n21.\nIn this regard, it is profitable to refer to a judgment\n\nof the Hon'ble Apex Court in\nEastern Coalfields Limited and\n\nOthers v. Prativa Biswas and Others\n[2018 (14) SCC\n\n435] where it was held:\n\n\"17. When the pay scales were converted to and\npaid in Coal India Ltd., the respondents' pay drawn could\nnot have been reduced, inasmuch as pay protection had\nbeen assured to them and in view of the aforesaid order\nthat attained finality and pay fixation was to be made in\nthe manner that total emoluments drawn were not less.\nAfter fitment, if it was found that lesser amount was to\nbe received as salary on or after 1-1-1987, it was\nrequired that the shortfall was made good by way of\npersonal adjustment(s). Accordingly, protection was to\nbe made on the fitment by grant of personal pay\nmeaning thereby the pay could not have been reduced\n\n- 38 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\non the fitment in ECL pay scales. The order dated 26-8-\n2002 was to be complied with in pith and substance;\nrather it was violated by the aforesaid method of\nfixation. As apparent from the aforesaid figure of\nfitment, pertaining to Prathiva Biswas, Senior Staff\nNurse, Central Hospital, Kalla. The fitment that was\nmade on 20-5-2003/21-5-2003 was clearly in violation of\nthe order as well as the provisions of option form and\neven subject to the conditions on which the absorption\nhad been made. Thus, in our opinion, the Division Bench\nhas rightly set aside the order passed by the Single\nBench by the order impugned [\nPrativa Biswas v. Union of\nIndia\n, 2008 SCC OnLine Cal 651 : (2009) 1 CHN 101] ; it\nwas not the total emoluments that matter. Salary\nprotection was to be ensured, it could not have been\nreduced apart from emoluments. There was dual\nprotection; that was unfortunately ignored and\noverlooked by ECL in spite of the clear and categorical\norder passed by the Single Bench in the writ application\nof 1993, which order had attained finality, and had not\nbeen questioned by any of the parties.\"\n\n22. Therefore, the claim of the petitioner that he is\n\nentitled to resetting of his pay to bring it on par with the pay\n\nscale in the respondent No.1 till he retired, merits\n\nconsideration.\n\n23. In so far as the claim of the petitioner that he was\n\nentitled to be continued to be in service in the respondent No.3\n\n- 39 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\ntill he attained the age of 60 years, it is relevant to note that in\n\nthe letter dated 08.05.1995, it was specifically mentioned as\n\nfollows:\n\n\"6. Superannuation benefits other than pension will\ncontinue to be admissible to the members of the staff to\nthe extent as per the existing Rules obtaining in the\nReserve Bank of India until such time as the Discount and\nFinance House of India Limited frames its own Scheme.\nThe superannuation age will be 58 years except in case of\nemployees in Class IV and it will be 60 years in case of an\nemployee in Class-IV.\"\n\n24. It is undisputed that Discount and Finance House of\n\nIndia Limited (Staff) Rules, 1995 (for short, 'the Rules, 1995')\n\nprescribed the age of retirement of its employees as 58 years.\n\nIt is not disputed that Rule 16 of the Rules, 1995 was amended\n\nby an office order dated 28.12.1998 enhancing the age of\n\nretirement to 60 years. After the respondent No.3 brought in\n\nUniform Service Rules / SBI DFHI Ltd. Staff Service Rules (for\n\nshort, 'the Rules, 2007') with effect from 01.01.2007, which\n\nwere applicable to all its employees, superseding and replacing\n\nthe pre-merger service rules of the erstwhile SBI-Glits and\n\nDFHI, the petitioner cannot contend that he was entitled to be\n\ncontinued till 60 years as was the case in the respondent No.1.\n\n- 40 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nThe period of service in any Organization is based on the Rules\n\nframed by such Organization. The petitioner did not challenge\n\nthe Rules, 2007 until he retired from service and has now\n\nbelatedly claimed that the age of retirement in the banking\n\nsector was generally 60 years. Besides, this, the petitioner has\n\nraised this question after nearly four years from the date of his\n\nretirement from respondent No.3. Therefore, he is not entitled\n\nto the relief of continuation in service in respondent No.3 till\n\nthe age of 60 years.\n\nThe writ petition is allowed in part. As a result, the\n\nrespondent No.3 is directed to pay the differential amount of\n\npay and allowances to the petitioner by granting the pay scale\n\nand allowances on par with that obtaining in the Reserve Bank\n\nof India and re-determine the pension payable to the petitioner\n\nin accordance with law. The respondent No.3 shall comply with\n\nthe above within three months from the date of receipt of a\n\ncertified copy of this order, failing which, the respondent No.3\n\nshall pay the petitioner interest @ 9% per annum on the\n\ndifferential amount from the date of filing of the writ petition till\n\nthe date of payment.\n\n- 41 -\n\nNC: 2024:KHC:46664\n\nWP No. 20815 of 2014\n\nThe relief sought by the petitioner to notionally continue\n\nhis service in the respondent No.3 till the age of 60 years is\n\nrejected.\n\nSd/-\n\n(R.
