Leave granted.\n\n3. This appeal by special leave emanates from the\norder dated 18th January, 2024, passed by the\nlearned Single Judge of the High Court of\nJudicature at Patna1 whereby, the appeal preferred\nby respondent No.2-accused2 under Section 14(A)(2)\nof the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nNEETU KHAJURIA\n\nDate: 2025.07.21\n\n1 Hereinafter referred to as the “High Court”.\n17:54:20 IST\nReason: 2 Hereinafter referred to as the “respondent No.2”.\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 19893 was allowed and\nshe was granted bail in connection with Mahila P.S.\nCase No. 17 of 2022 registered for the offences\npunishable under Sections 341, 323, 328, 376, 120-\nB read with\nSection 34\nof the Indian Penal Code,\n18604 and Sections 3/4 of the Immoral Traffic\n(Prevention) Act, 19565 and\nSections 3(1)(w)\n/\n3(2)(va)\n\nof the SC/ST Act. The appellant-victim herein is the\ninformant in the said FIR.\n\n4. The prosecution case as against respondent\nNo.2 is that she while being posted as the\nSuperintendent of the Uttar Raksha Grih, Gaighat,\nPatna indulged in administering intoxicating\nmedicines and injections to the appellant-victim and\nother female inmates of the protection home, who\nwere later on subjected to sexual exploitation and\nmental torture. Grave allegations are attributed to\nthe respondent-accused that she used to send the\nladies housed in the protection home, outside for\nthe purpose of providing sexual favours to\ninfluential people. The FIR in the instant case came\n\n3 Hereinafter referred to as the “SC/ST Act”.\n4 Hereinafter referred to as the “\nIPC\n”.\n5 Hereinafter referred to as the “\nIT Act\n”.\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nto be based on the intervention of the High Court\nwhich took cognizance of a newspaper report\nnarrating the ordeals faced by the females kept in\nthe protection home. The investigation was also\nmonitored by the High Court.\n\n5. It may be noted that during the course of\ninvestigation, few more ladies in addition to the\nappellant herein made allegations of torture and\nsexual exploitation against respondent No.2.\n\n6. The application for bail filed by respondent\nNo.2 came to be rejected by the learned Exclusive\nSpecial Court (SC/ST Act), Patna6 vide order dated\n10th July, 2023. Respondent No.2 preferred an\nappeal under\nSection 14(A)(2)\nof the SC/ST Act\nbefore the High Court, assailing the order passed by\nthe Special Court.\n\n7. In the meanwhile, chargesheet came to be filed\nagainst respondent No.2 in the Special Court which\ntook cognizance of the offences punishable under\n\nSections 341\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n120B\n,\n,\nof\nthe IPC,\nSections 3\n/\nof the IT Act and\nSection\nHereinafter referred to as the “Special Court”.\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n3(1)(w)/3(2)(va) of the SC/ST Act vide order dated\n29th August, 2023.\n\n8. It may be noted that in the appeal before the\nHigh Court, the appellant-victim was not impleaded\nas a party, and bail was granted to the accused\n(respondent No.2) in clear violation of the mandate\nunder Section 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act which makes\nhearing of the victim in any prayer for bail essential.\nThe High Court, vide order dated 18th January,\n2024, allowed the appeal filed by respondent No.2\nand granted her bail with the following reasoning: -\n\n“7. Having heard learned counsel for the parties\nand taking into consideration that there is no\nspecific allegation against the appellant, the\nCourt is inclined to allow this appeal.\nAccordingly, the appeal is allowed and the\nimpugned order dated 10.07.2023 is hereby set\naside.”\n\n9. The appellant-victim is before us through this\nappeal by special leave to assail the order passed by\nthe High Court.\n\n10. We have heard and considered the\nsubmissions advanced by learned counsel for the\nappellant-victim, learned counsel representing\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nrespondent No.2-accused and the learned standing\ncounsel representing the State of Bihar.\n\n11. Learned counsel for the appellant-victim\nvehemently and fervently contended that the High\nCourt granted bail to respondent No.2 by a cryptic\norder without assigning any reasons whatsoever and\ntotally ignoring the critical fact that respondent No.2\nbeing the Superintendent of the women protection\nhome was a person in authority, who misused her\nposition to exploit the helpless female inmates of the\ninstitution and deliberately orchestrated their\nsexual exploitation by various influential persons.\nNumerous women inmates have made grave\nallegations in their statements recorded under\n\nSection 164\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n1973, stating that they were sent out of the\ninstitution for providing sexual gratification to\noutsiders and those who resisted, were injected with\nintoxicants and under the influence thereof, they\nwere subjected to sexual exploitation by different\nmen.\n\n12. It was further contended that unidentified men\nwere allowed access into the protection home where\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nthey would take advantage of the helpless condition\nof the victims so as to gain sexual favours.\n\n13. He further pointed out that pursuant to the\nrelease of respondent No.2 on bail, she has been\nreinstated in service, and she is heading another\nprotection home within the State of Bihar. As per\nthe learned counsel, this approach of the State\nauthorities in allowing respondent No.2 to continue\nfunctioning as a person in-charge of the protection\nhome, despite there being allegations of misuse of\npower to facilitate sexual exploitation of female\ninmates would imminently expose the inmates to a\ngrave risk of being subjected to sexual exploitation.\nHe submitted that it is apparent that the concerned\nauthorities of the State Government are hands in\nglove with the accused and have no intention of\npunishing respondent No.2 for her recalcitrant\nconduct. Rather she has been rewarded with a fresh\ntenure in an identical protection home where she\nhad earlier committed the atrocities on the female\ninmates.\n\n14. Learned counsel further submitted that in\ncase, respondent No.2 is allowed to remain on bail,\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nthere is an imminent danger of her influencing the\nwitnesses and frustrating the trial. He pointed out\nthat as a matter of fact, numerous threats have\nalready been given to the witnesses of this case and\nhence, the continuance of respondent No.2 on bail\nwould be detrimental to a fair trial.\n\n15. On these grounds and looking to the gravity\nand nature of allegations, learned counsel for the\nappellant implored the Court to exercise its\nextraordinary jurisdiction under\nArticle 136\nof the\nConstitution of India so as to cancel the bail granted\nto respondent No.2.\n\n16. Learned standing counsel representing\nrespondent No.1-State of Bihar supported the\nsubmissions advanced by learned counsel for the\nappellant-victim. He contended that after thorough\ninvestigation, grave allegations of misuse of official\nposition to exploit the helpless and destitute female\ninmates housed in the protection home have been\nsubstantiated. Respondent No.2 being a person in\nauthority shall definitely influence the fair trial of\nthe case and there is imminent threat to the life and\nlimb of the victim ladies, if respondent No.2 is\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nallowed to continue on bail during the pendency of\nthe trial. However, on a pertinent query being posed,\nlearned standing counsel was not in a position to\nexplain the conduct of the State authorities in\nreinstating respondent No.2-accused and putting\nher in charge of another women’s home in spite of\nthe fact that she is facing a prosecution for abuse of\npowers and sexual exploitation while working in a\nsimilar institution.\n\n17. Learned counsel representing respondent\nNo.2-accused strenuously tried to justify the\nimpugned order. He urged that the High Court,\nwhile considering the bail application has taken\nnote of the material available on record and rightly\nfound that there are no specific allegations against\nrespondent No.2 in the prosecution evidence and\nthereafter, a reasoned order has been passed\ndirecting release of respondent No.2 on bail. He\nurged that respondent No.2 being a woman had\nlanguished in custody for almost 500 days, since\n27th August, 2022 and this was the most vital factor\nwhich weighed with the High Court in favour of\ngrant of bail. He urged that detailed discussion of\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nevidence at the stage of deciding the bail application\nmay prejudice the trial and hence, it would not be\nfair to say that the High Court has not adverted to\nthe merits of the case.\n\n18. He urged that respondent No.2 being a woman\nis entitled to a special consideration for grant of bail\nand as such, this Court should be slow in\ninterfering with the order passed by the High Court\ndirecting release of respondent No.2 on bail.\n\n19. We have given our thoughtful consideration to\nthe submissions advanced at the bar and have gone\nthrough the impugned order and the material\nplaced on record.\n\n20. At the outset, we may like to note that the\nallegations attributed to respondent No.2 shake the\nconscience of the Court. Respondent No.2 being\nposted as the Officer in-charge of the women’s\nprotection home was required to work as a protector\nof the inmates, but she turned rogue and indulged\nin sexual exploitation of the helpless and destitute\nwomen who had been placed in the said protection\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nhome which is an institution created to provide\nthem safety and security.\n\n21. Thus, it is clearly a case, wherein the person\nput in the role of a saviour has turned into a devil.\n\n22. Not only are the allegations attributed to\nrespondent No. 2-accused are grave and\nreprehensible in nature, in addition thereto, the fact\nremains that releasing respondent No. 2 on bail is\nbound to have an adverse effect on trial because\nthere would be an imminent possibility of the\nwitnesses being threatened.\n\n23. Recently, this Court in the case of\nShabeen\nAhmad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr.7\n\nwhile placing reliance upon the case of\nAjwar v.\nWaseem8\ncancelled the bail granted to the accused\nin a dowry death case observing as follows:\n\n“18.... A superficial application of bail parameters\nnot only undermines the gravity of the offence\nitself but also risks weakening public faith in the\njudiciary’s resolve to combat the menace of dowry\ndeaths. It is this very perception of justice, both\nwithin and outside the courtroom, that courts\nmust safeguard, lest we risk normalizing a crime\n\n7 (2025) 4 SCC 172.\n\n8 (2024) 10 SCC 768.\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nthat continues to claim numerous innocent lives.\n\nThese observations regarding grant of bail in\ngrievous crimes were thoroughly dealt with by this\nCourt in\nAjwar v. Waseem\nin the following paras:\n\n“26. While considering as to whether bail\nought to be granted in a matter involving a\nserious criminal offence, the Court must\nconsider relevant factors like the nature of\nthe accusations made against the accused,\nthe manner in which the crime is alleged to\nhave been committed, the gravity of the\noffence, the role attributed to the accused,\nthe criminal antecedents of the accused,\nthe probability of tampering of the\nwitnesses and repeating the offence, if the\naccused are released on bail, the likelihood\nof the accused being unavailable in the\nevent bail is granted, the possibility of\nobstructing the proceedings and evading\nthe courts of justice and the overall\ndesirability of releasing the accused on\nbail. [Refer :\nChaman Lal v. State of U.P.\n[Chaman Lal\nv. State of U.P., [(2004) 7 SCC\n525];\nKalyan Chandra Sarkar v. Rajesh\nRanjan\n[(2004) 7 SCC 528];\nMasroor v.\nState of U.P.\n[(2009) 14 SCC 286];\n\nPrasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee\n\n[(2010) 14 SCC 496];\nNeeru Yadav v. State\nof U.P.\n[(2014) 16 SCC 508];\nAnil Kumar\nYadav v. State (NCT of Delhi\n) [(2018) 12\nSCC 129];\nMahipal v. Rajesh Kumar\n\n[(2020) 2 SCC 118].\n\n27. It is equally well settled that bail\nonce granted, ought not to be cancelled\nin a mechanical manner. However, an\nunreasoned or perverse order of bail is\nalways open to interference by the\nsuperior court. If there are serious\nallegations against the accused, even if he\nhas not misused the bail granted to him,\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\nsuch an order can be cancelled by the\nsame Court that has granted the bail. Bail\ncan also be revoked by a superior court if it\ntranspires that the courts below have\nignored the relevant material available on\nrecord or not looked into the gravity of the\noffence or the impact on the society\nresulting in such an order.\nIn\nP v. State of\nM.P.\n[(2022) 15 SCC 211] decided by a\nthree-Judge Bench of this Court [authored\nby one of us (Hima Kohli, J.)] has spelt out\nthe considerations that must weigh with\nthe Court for interfering in an order\ngranting bail to an accused under\nSection\n439(1)\nCrPC in the following words : (SCC\np. 224, para 24)\n\n“24.\n\nAs can be discerned from the\nabove decisions, for cancelling bail\nonce granted, the court must consider\nwhether any supervening\ncircumstances have arisen or the\nconduct of the accused post grant of\nbail demonstrates that it is no longer\nconducive to a fair trial to permit him\nto retain his freedom by enjoying the\nconcession of bail during trial [\nDolat\nRam v. State of Haryana\n, (1995) 1\nSCC 349] . To put it differently, in\nordinary circumstances, this Court\nwould be loathe to interfere with an\norder passed by the court below\ngranting bail but if such an order is\nfound to be illegal or perverse or\npremised on material that is\nirrelevant, then such an order is\nsusceptible to scrutiny and\ninterference by the appellate\ncourt.”\n\nConsiderations for setting aside bail\norders\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\n\n28. The considerations that weigh with the\nappellate court for setting aside the bail\norder on an application being moved by the\naggrieved party include any supervening\ncircumstances that may have occurred\nafter granting relief to the accused, the\nconduct of the accused while on bail, any\nattempt on the part of the accused to\nprocrastinate, resulting in delaying the\ntrial, any instance of threats being\nextended to the witnesses while on bail,\nany attempt on the part of the accused to\ntamper with the evidence in any manner.\n\nWe may add that this list is only\nillustrative and not exhaustive. However,\nthe court must be cautious that at the\nstage of granting bail, only a prima facie\ncase needs to be examined and detailed\nreasons relating to the merits of the case\nthat may cause prejudice to the accused,\nought to be avoided. Suffice it is to state\nthat the bail order should reveal the\nfactors that have been considered by\nthe Court for granting relief to the\naccused.”\n(Emphasis Supplied)\n\n24. It is trite that bail once granted should not be\ncancelled ordinarily, but where the facts are so\ngrave that they shake the conscience of the Court;\nand where the release of the accused on bail would\nhave an adverse impact on the society, the Courts\nare not powerless and are expected to exercise\njurisdiction conferred by law to cancel such bail\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\norders so as to subserve the ends of justice. The\npresent one is precisely a case of such nature.\n\n25. We may note that the impugned order could\nhave been quashed on the solitary ground of non-\ncompliance of Section 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act\nwhich mandates that notice to a victim is essential\nbefore a prayer for bail is being considered, in a case\nwhere the offence/s under the SC/ST Act have been\napplied.\n\n26. On going through the memo of appeal filed by\nthe respondent-accused in the High Court, we find\nthat the appellant-victim was not impleaded as a\nparty respondent therein and hence, did not have\nthe benefit of right of hearing as warranted by\nSection 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act.\n\n27. Furthermore, keeping in view the principles\n\nlaid down by\nthis Court in\nShabeen Ahmad\n(supra),\nwe are of the firm opinion that the present case is\nan exceptional one, wherein the grant of bail by the\nHigh Court to respondent No.2-accused by a cryptic\norder dated 18th January, 2024 has resulted into\ntravesty of justice. Grant of bail to the person\nCrl. Appeal @SLP (Crl.) No (s). 4335 of 2024\naccused of such grave offences without assigning\nreasons shakes the conscience of the Court and\nwould have an adverse impact on the society.\nFurthermore, the release of the accused on bail\nwould adversely impact the trial as there would be\nhigh chances of the material witnesses being\nthreatened and influenced. Our conclusions are\nfortified by the fact that respondent No.2-accused\nhas been reinstated to the position of\nSuperintendent of another protection home which\nspeaks volumes about her clout and influence with\nthe administration.\n\n28. Consequently, it is a fit case, warranting\nexercise of this Court’s extraordinary jurisdiction\nunder\nArticle 136\nof the Constitution of India so as\nto interfere in the impugned order dated 18th\nJanuary, 2024 which is hereby quashed and set\naside.\n\n29. The bail granted to respondent No.2-accused is\nhereby cancelled. She shall surrender before the\ntrial Court within a period of four weeks from today,\nfailing which, the trial Court shall cancel her bail\nbonds and ensure that she is taken into custody for\nCrl.

The trial Court and the\nDistrict administration shall ensure that proper\nprotection and support is provided to the victims of\nthe case. In case there is any change of\ncircumstances, respondent No.2-accused shall be at\nliberty to renew her prayer of bail before the\nappropriate forum.\n\n30. The appeal is allowed in the above terms.\n\n31.
