On 11.06.1997, approval was granted by CIT to the Pension\nTrust under Rule 2(1) of Part 'B' of 4th Schedule of 1961 Act to take\neffect from 01.04.1995. Subsequently, MoU was executed on\n10.01.1998 for employees of NTPC in the workmen category.\nMeetings were held by Board of Trustees on 05.12.1997 and\n22.01.1998 regarding investment of the Trust Funds, recovery of\ncontributions, authorization to investment committee for purchase of\nannuities etc. Pension Trust Communication (PTC) 03/98 was issued\non 06.02.1998 for deduction of Past Service Contribution for\nExecutives and Supervisors from February, 1998 onwards in\nmaximum 120 installments.\n\nH. Petitioners were members of the 1995 Scheme and having\nmade contributions, they were entitled to continue to receive benefits\nthereunder. However, illegally and arbitrarily, the Board of Trustees\nintroduced a new restructured scheme on 03.02.2003, which was a\n'Defined Contribution' Scheme ('2003 Scheme') instead of the earlier\n'Defined Benefit' Scheme and adversely affected the rights of the\nPetitioners to higher pension. The Scheme was arbitrarily made\napplicable retrospectively from 01.04.2002, taking away vested and\naccrued rights of even those who had retired prior to the introduction\nof the Scheme.\n\nI. Aggrieved with the 2003 Scheme, one Mohd. Yunus, an ex-\nemployee of NTPC who retired as a Senior Materials Officer on\n31.07.2002 filed a Writ Petition (Civil) No. 740/2004, before the\nAllahabad High Court. His pension was not sanctioned, as according\nto NTPC, annuities from LIC were kept in abeyance on the ground\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 20 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nthat there was steep hike in annuity prices affecting the viability of the\nPension Scheme. Upon restructuring, pension of Mohd. Yunus was\nfixed at Rs.1,015/- whereas under the 1995 Scheme, he would have\nbeen entitled to Rs.8,078/-.\n\nJ. The writ petition was allowed by Allahabad High Court vide\njudgment dated 17.12.2009 holding that since Mohd. Yunus had\nretired on 31.07.2002, he was entitled for pension under the 1995\nScheme. This judgment was challenged by the Pension Trust before\nthe Supreme Court and Civil Appeal No. 8054/2011 was dismissed on\n09.12.2015. Supreme Court observed that retiral benefits of Mohd.\nYunus stood crystalized on the date of his retirement i.e. 31.07.2002\nand any rules/guidelines notified thereafter including Circular dated\n03.02.2003 could not be made applicable to him.\n\nK. While the matter was pending in the Supreme Court, the\njudgment of Allahabad High Court possibly paved the way for the\nTrustees to carry out an amendment to the Trust Deed dated\n12.03.1997, invoking para 8 of the Deed and a Supplementary Trust\nDeed was executed on 09.08.2011 and the CIT granted approval vide\norder dated 06.02.2013, retrospectively from 01.04.2002.\n\n3. Owing to the amendment in the 1995 Scheme, three writ petitions\nbeing W.P. (C) Nos. 108/2011, 109/2011 and 1259/2013 were filed in this\nCourt challenging the amendment and the consequential reduction in the\npension. The remaining writ petitions referred to above were filed post the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of\nSecretary, NTPC Pension\nTrust v. Mohd. Yunus and Others\n, Civil Appeal No. 8054/2011, dated\n09.12.2015, seeking similar reliefs. The second batch of writ petitions was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 21 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\ndismissed by learned Single Judge of this Court vide judgment dated\n28.02.2017 on ground of maintainability. The judgment was challenged\nbefore the Division Bench of this Court and the appeals were disposed of\nvide judgment dated 01.11.2018.\n\nThe Division Bench held that after the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in\nMohd. Yunus\n(supra), it was no longer\nopen to NTPC/Pension Trust to contend that writ petitions were not\nmaintainable against them. During the course of hearing of the appeals,\nNTPC/Pension Trust also raised an objection that the writ petitions were\nbarred by delay and laches.\n\nThis contention was also negated by the\nDivision Bench observing that the Petitioners were awaiting the outcome of\nthe decision of the Supreme Court with regard to the correctness of the\njudgment of Allahabad High Court in\nMohd. Yunus\n(supra) and could not\nbe faulted for filing petitions after the decision was pronounced. It also\nneeds mention at this stage that the Division Bench segregated the appeals\ninto two categories based on the dates of retirement of the Petitioners i.e.\nthose who retired prior to 03.02.2003 and those who retired post thereto. In\nthe former category were the Appellants in appeals being LPA Nos. 200,\n229, 230, 233, 241, 242 and 253/2017. In the case of these Appellants, the\nDivision Bench additionally observed that they were similarly placed as\nMohd. Yunus, who had retired prior to the said date and deserved to be\nplaced on the same pedestal. This judgment was taken up in appeal by\nNTPC Pension Trust and by order dated 29.09.2022, in Civil Appeal Nos.\n4695-4726/2019, the Supreme Court remitted the matter back to the learned\nSingle Judge of this Court for examining the writ petitions on merits\nupholding the judgment of the Division Bench on the issue of\nmaintainability. All rights and contentions of the parties were kept open.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 22 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nSubsequently, the earlier three writ petitions were also tagged with the batch\nof petitions remanded by the Supreme Court and all were heard together.\n\n4. From a holistic reading of the documents filed by the Pension Trust,\nfurther chronology of events is:\n\nA. On 18.01.1999, PTC 07/99 was issued with respect to options\nwith regard to change in the number of installments for recovery of\nPast Service Contributions due to change in retirement age from 58 to\n60 years. By letter dated 16.08.1999, clarification was given by the\nActuary, M/s. K.A. Pandit, on Annuity and Resignation Rates in\nactuarial valuation. Meeting of the Board of Trustees was held on\n20.08.1999 to discuss actuarial valuation of 1995 Scheme to assess\nthe impact of increase in retirement age.\n\nB. On 06.07.2000, CPR No. 444/2000 was issued by NTPC\nrevising the pay scales and allowances for employees in the Executive\ncategory below scheduled posts at the Board level. Revision was to\ntake effect from 01.01.1997 and basis this revision, meeting of the\nBoard of Trustees was convened on 02.08.2000 to assess the impact\nof the pay revision. It was felt that an increase in contributions was\nrequired to keep the Trust economically viable and presentation was\nmade by the Actuary giving various options toward the viability\nincluding increase in contributions. Actual data of revised pay was\ncalled from all the Units to be provided to the Actuaries to enable\nthem to make realistic estimates of increase required in the\ncontributions and it was decided that for the time being, pension\nwould be paid on pre-revised salaries and decision to pay pension on\nrevised pay, including in cases already settled, was to be taken along\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 23 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nwith decision regarding increase in Contributions.\n\nC. Various meetings were held thereafter as brought forth by\nPension Trust, including presentations and discussions by and with\nthe Actuaries on enhancement of additional contributions and\nprovisional recovery of lumpsum amounts from all categories of\nemployees. Finally, in the 20th Meeting of the Board of Trustees held\non 19.12.2002, decision was taken to restructure the 1995 Scheme\nfrom 'Defined Benefit' to 'Defined Contribution' Scheme. Under the\nrestructured Scheme, contribution structure was changed for\nExecutives by contribution of 1% of Basic Pay w.e.f. September,\n2002 as Monthly Percentage Salary and Additional Contribution at\nRs.788/- per month escalating at 8% per annum. The Defined Benefit\nwas also changed to payment of pension based on actual contribution\nof the principal amount with interest at the rate not exceeding pro rata\nearnings on the investment by the Trust. It was decided that all cases\nof superannuation after 01.04.2002 and cases of death while in service\nor of incapacitation after 31.08.2002, except cases already settled, will\nbe settled based on the new principles. Resolution was subject to\napproval by NTPC and CIT as per Clause 8 of the Trust Deed.\nPending the final decision, pension payable to employees who retired\nw.e.f. 01.04.2002 was kept in abeyance.\n\nD. Following the aforesaid decision, PTC No. 16/2002 was issued\non 19.12.2002, restructuring the 1995 Scheme for Executives both in\nrespect of contributions and the benefits. The changes can be\nencapsulated as follows:-\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 24 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n\"2.0 The contribution structure has been changed as under for\nexecutives:\n\na) Monthly Percentage salary contribution in case of\nExecutives shall be 1% of Basic Pay w.e.f.

In the 107th meeting of NBC held on 27.12.2003, it was decided\nthat 1995 Scheme shall continue to operate as a Defined Contribution\nScheme. PTC 17/2003 was issued on 03.02.2003 formulating the\nrestructured Defined Benefit Scheme as Defined Contribution Scheme\n(hereinafter referred to as the '2003 Scheme'). This meant that\npurchase value of pension annuity was limited to 'Actual\nAccumulated Contribution' made by a member to the Pension Trust.\nThe methodology of working out Accumulated Contribution was as\nfollows:-\n\n\"2.1 Computation of 'Accumulated Contribution' as stated in\npara 2.0 above in case of Executives (Except in case of those\nExecutives who have specifically opted out as at para 3.1.1\nbelow):-\n\n2.1.1 The contributions paid by each Member till September\n2002 along with pro-rata earnings after adjustment of amount\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 25 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\npaid by Trust for purchase of pension annuities till date, will be\ncredited to the individual's accounts.

In the 21st meeting of the Board of Trustees held on 11.03.2003,\nthe decision taken in the 20th meeting was confirmed along with\nconfirmation of PTC 17/03 dated 03.02.2003 and PTC 18/03 dated\n\n03.02.2003. As per the documents placed on record by Pension Trust,\nseveral attempts were made from time to time for revival of 1995\nScheme by looking into fresh actuary valuations etc. but no resolution\ncould be found. By communication dated 28.10.2010, approval was\nsought from CMD, NTPC for amendment of 1995 Scheme w.e.f.\n01.04.2002 and execution of Supplementary Trust Deed in accordance\nwith provisions of Trust Deed and 1961 Act, as also approval from\nCIT.\n\nH. Supplementary Trust Deed was executed on 09.08.2011 for\nrestructuring the Pension Scheme as Defined Contribution Scheme\nwith effect from 01.04.2002 and approval was received from Ministry\nof Power, Government of India on 01.12.2011. Ministry directed that\nadministrative cost of the Scheme shall be borne by the Trust Fund\nand members' contribution should not be less than 1% of Basic Pay +\nDA as also that NTPC should immediately stop contribution to the\nexisting 1995 Scheme. Admittedly, CIT, granted approval on\n06.02.2013 under Rule 4 of Part 'B' of Fourth Schedule of 1961 Act,\nretrospectively from 01.04.2002.\n\nSUBMISSIONS AND CONTENTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE\nPETITIONERS:\n\n5.

The 1995 Scheme was made\noperative from 01.04.1995 and was formulated with the prior approval of\nGovernment of India, Board of Directors of NTPC and CIT. As per MoU\ndated 07.03.1997, the 1995 Scheme was a Self-Contributory Scheme\nwherein NTPC's liability was limited only to Rs.100/- per annum for all\nemployees taken together and the rest of the contribution was by the\nemployees. Employees were made members of the Scheme compulsorily\nand had no option not to become members and/or contribute to this Scheme.\nIn consonance with the salient features of the 1995 Scheme, members of the\nScheme including the Petitioners were to contribute in three ways i.e.\nMonthly Fixed Percentage Salary Contribution, Past Service Contribution\nand Monthly Additional Contribution. The Scheme assured defined benefits\non the date of superannuation providing that a member on superannuation\nwill be entitled to pension commencing from the month following the month\nof superannuation at the rate of 1.25% per year of Reckonable Service\nlimited to 50% of the salary last drawn and for Reckonable Service of less\nthan 40 years, the benefit was proportionately reduced. It was thus assured\nthat by contributing substantial parts of their earnings including for the past\nservice, Petitioners would have a defined pension to cater for their post-\nretirement period for a life time. In case of death or disablement of an\nemployee while in service, the Beneficiary was entitled to pension at the rate\nof 50% of the last drawn salary of the employee. There was thus no\njustification for the amendment in the Scheme and that too, resulting in\nconsiderable reduction in the quantum of monthly pension.\n\n6.

Albeit,\nClause 8 of the Trust Deed empowered the Trustees at any time with the\nconsent of NTPC or on its recommendation to amend or add to the\nprovisions of the Trust Deed by a Supplementary Deed but this was subject\nto two riders i.e. the alteration should not adversely affect the benefits paid\nunder the Trust or the benefits accrued upto the date of such amendment or\nthe object of the Trust and no alteration would be without 'prior approval' of\nthe CIT. In the present case, both conditions have been violated inasmuch as\nfirstly, there was no prior approval from the CIT which was admittedly\ngranted on 06.02.2013 w.e.f. 01.04.2002 and secondly, the restructured\nScheme was a Defined Contributary Scheme and the pension payable was\nconsiderably reduced. Thus, the amendment was illegal and invalid and\ncannot be sustained in law. Moreover, the amendment was sought to be\nmade applicable retrospectively to those who had retired prior to 03.02.2003\ni.e. to employees who retired on or after 01.04.2002 and whose pensions\nwere kept in abeyance awaiting the restructuring of the pension. It is a\nsettled law that any change in service condition of an employee and that too,\nthe one which adversely effects his or her interest can only be prospective\nand with the consent of the employee.\n\n7. Right of the Petitioners to receive retiral benefits under 1995 Scheme\nstood crystallized on the respective dates of their retirements prior to\n03.02.2003 and therefore, 2003 Scheme could not be made applicable to\ntake away vested rights that had accrued on retirement.

Yunus stood\ncrystalized on the date of his retirement i.e. 31.07.2002 and thus any\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 30 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nRule/Guideline notified thereafter including the Scheme dated 03.02.2003\nwould not be applicable to him. Cases of Petitioners, who retired prior to\n03.02.2003, are squarely covered by\nthe said judgment\nof the Supreme Court\nand no differential treatment can be meted out to them.\n\n8. Insofar as the Petitioners who retired post 03.02.2003 are concerned,\nthey would also be governed by the 1995 Scheme and 2003 Scheme will be\ninapplicable. 1995 Scheme was regulated by Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997.\nClause 8 of the Deed provided that any amendment could be with the prior\napproval of Board of NTPC and CIT. Therefore, any amendment could be\nvalid only when the approval came. There is no dispute that in the present\ncase, CIT gave his approval on 06.02.2013 albeit retrospectively from\n01.04.2002. Therefore, there was no prior approval and post-facto approval\ncannot take the place of 'prior approval' in law. Therefore, at the highest,\nthe 2003 Scheme could be valid and operate from on or after 06.02.2013,\nwhen the approval was granted and will be inapplicable to retirees before the\nsaid date. Additionally, even the Supplementary Trust Deed was executed\nonly on 09.08.2011 and there is no gainsaying that a Trust Deed could be\namended only by a Supplementary Deed and even on this score, the 2003\nScheme cannot apply retrospectively.\n\n9. The employees of NTPC including the Petitioners had no option but\nto compulsorily become members of the Pension Scheme and their\ncontributions were deducted directly from the pay. Petitioners contributed\nnot only a percentage from their current salary and also made additional\ncontribution on a monthly basis but the contributions extended to past\nservice also. These contributions were on an assurance of a defined benefit\nin the form of monthly pension to the extent of 50% of the last drawn salary\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 31 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nto cater to the needs of their retired lives. Illustratively, Petitioner No. 2\njoined NTPC on 24.12.1982 and after receiving six promotions retired as\nAdditional General Manager on 30.06.2008. Thus, calculation under the\n1995 Scheme taking the Reckonable Service, which includes past and\nescalated future service, said Petitioner was entitled to a sum of Rs.24,934/-\nas pension on the last drawn salary of Rs.75,121/- (Basic Pay + DA)\nwhereas under the 2003 Scheme, he is getting Rs.583/-.\n\n10. The cut-off date of 01.04.2002 for implementation of the restructured\nPension Scheme has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved as the\npensioners who retired prior to this date and those thereafter, were a\nhomogenous class of retirees who had all contributed under the 1995\nScheme. Moreover, the justification given by the Pension Trust for\nrestructuring the Pension Scheme is also without any basis and incorrect on\nfacts. Trustees assert four reasons for restructuring the 1995 Scheme i.e.\nincrease in wages, enhancement in age of retirement, increase in rates of\npurchase of annuities and reduction in returns from investments. If there was\na revision in the salary, employees' contribution also increased since\ncontributions were a fixed percentage of the salaries. If there was\nenhancement in age of retirement from 58 to 60 years, the employees\ncontributed for two more years. It is Trust's own imagination that the Trust\nfund was unviable. The Actuaries were hired by the Trustees and rendered\nreports to suit their dictates. Neither were the reports shared with the\nemployees and/or their representatives nor the basis of the reports were ever\nshared or made known. The income of the Trust, to the best of knowledge of\nthe Petitioners, was manifold higher than the money invested in the purchase\nof pension annuity.

Similarly, for every\npreceding year, the interest income from the contributions of the Member\nwas far more than the money spent on purchase of annuities. Moreover, as\nper Guidelines of Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Trust had to\ninvest its investable funds in Central and State Governments securities and\nPSUs/Financial Institutions securities, but the Trustees never furnished any\ndetails of the investments of the funds and/or the quantum of returns against\neach investment. Additionally, the liveries, shoes and raincoats which were\nbeing given to all NTPC employees on yearly basis free of charge were also\nstopped and value of these items was added to pension contribution for each\nemployee.\n\n11. The prime reason sought to be brought forth by the Respondents for\nrestructuring the Pension Scheme was increase in purchase price of\nannuities, which is nothing but a disguise to take away the defined benefits\nunder 1995 Scheme. There can be no doubt that while formulating the 1995\nScheme, NTPC would have taken the assistance of Consultants and\nAccountants/Actuaries, who in turn would have taken into consideration\nfactors such as price escalation, availability of funds in future etc. and\ncatered for all the fluctuations. No details have been furnished by the\nRespondents with regard to investments of its investable funds in Central\nGovernment and State Governments Securities as well as in PSU/Financial\nInstitutions Securities. No documents have been filed to show the alleged\npaucity of funds by the Pension Trust and in fact, strangely now the\nargument is taken that the 1995 Scheme had become unviable in the initial\nyears, which albeit incorrect, only goes to show that all the while the 1995\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 33 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nScheme was being operated by the Trust, they were not managing the same\nin the manner it should have been.\n\n12. Contention of the Respondents that from time to time, decisions were\ntaken in various meetings to ascertain the viability of the Trust and that too,\nin a transparent manner with the consent and in the presence of the\nPetitioners and the other employees, is of no aid to the Respondents.\nPetitioners and other similarly placed employees The amendment was\ncarried out by the Board of Trustees without putting the Petitioners to notice\nand/or hearing them. Much emphasis was laid on the meeting held on\n02.09.2002 but the fact is that only employees working in the Noida office\nattended the meeting, which was a miniscule percentage of the total\nemployees. Petitioners or individual employees had no voice vote in these\nmeetings. Even otherwise, in law the new restructured Scheme could not be\nmade applicable retrospectively and therefore, their consent or knowledge is\nmeaningless.

Jal Nigam and Another v. Jaswant Singh and Another\n, (2006)\n11 SCC 464]\n\n14. DPE issued O.M. dated 12.04.1991 permitting individual CPSEs at\ntheir discretion to work out a suitable annuity scheme through LIC based on\npurely voluntary contributions by the employees to the fund without any\nliability on the PSE or the Government of India and contribution of the\nManagement to the superannuation fund was restricted to Rs.100/- per\nannum for all employees taken together. Board of Directors of NTPC in\n141st meeting held on 18.03.1994 approved the proposal to formulate a self-\n\ncontributory superannuation benefit pension scheme. Pursuant thereto, an\nMoU was executed on 07.03.1997 between NTPC, NEFI and SEJC,\nrespectively envisaging formulation of a Trust to regulate the Pension\nScheme. Another MoU was executed on 10.01.1998 with the Associations\nof workmen. Accordingly, Pension Trust was created and Trust Deed was\nexecuted on 12.03.1997. The Pension Trust comprised originally of four\nTrustees from NTPC Management and six from employees' representatives.\nTrust was irrevocable and governed by the rules framed in this regard. The\neffective date of the Pension Scheme was fixed as 01.04.1995.\n\n15. The contributions made by the employees were directly deducted\nfrom the salary and sent to Pension Trust created for the purpose and the\nTrustees were solely responsible to administer the pension fund for\nemployees of NTPC. Annuities were purchased from LIC and upon\nsuperannuation of an employee, cost of annuity was to be paid by the Trust\nto LIC after which the latter would start paying monthly pension to the\nretiree. Therefore, NTPC had no control over the affairs and day-to-day\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 35 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nadministration of the Trust and contributions from the Petitioners and other\nemployees were solely the domain of the Pension Trust.\n\n16. Pension Scheme was introduced vide\nCPC\ndated 09.10.1997 for\nemployees in the Executive and Supervisory categories w.e.f. 01.04.1995\nand for administration of the Scheme, Trust had taken a Master Policy from\nLIC to pay the pension benefits as per the Scheme. Trust invested the funds\nin approved securities as per Government Guidelines and provisions of 1961\nAct. 1995 Scheme was based on defined benefit pattern in which pension\npayable was already pre-defined as a percentage of last salary drawn and\nwas paid based on length of service i.e. Reckonable Service which is total of\nEscalated Future Service and Past Continuous Service and salary included\nthe Basic Pay and Dearness Allowance. For those in service before\n01.04.1995, Past Service Contribution was to be made while for those who\njoined after 01.04.1995, contributions included Percentile Salary\nContribution and Additional Contribution, which was a fixed lumpsum\namount. The contributions were deposited in a Pool Account of the Trust to\nconstitute the corpus.\n\n17. Prior to introduction of the 1995 Scheme, Pension Trust had called for\nan Actuarial Report on the viability of the Scheme. Scheme was proposed\nbased on certain assumptions such as: (a) rate of mortality in service;\n\n(b) cost of annuity; (c) rate of increase in salaries; and (d) return on\ninvestment. The Scheme was not etched in stone or immutable. Clause D.4.5\nin the MoU contemplated discontinuation of the Scheme itself as is clear\nfrom the expression 'till the Pension Scheme continues' and thus, no\npermanency could be attached to the Scheme. Secondly, availability of\nmoney was subject to periodical review, which is clear from a reading of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 36 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nClause 6.3 of the salient features of the 1995 Scheme and Clause 3.3 of the\nTrust Rules and the Actuaries had to be engaged from time to time to\nscrutinize the availability of funds.\n\n18. In 2000, there was a shift as changed circumstances transformed the\nbasis of actuarial assumptions for the Scheme, necessitating restructuring of\nthe same to make the Scheme workable. Increased additional contributions\nwere required from members, but there was disinclination on the part of the\nmembers to do so. Other factors also contributed to the viability of the\nScheme being: enhancement in age of superannuation from 58 to 60 years;\nrevision in annuity rates by more than 50% by LIC w.e.f. 01.04.2002;\nincrease in salaries w.e.f. 01.01.1997; and decline in the return on\ninvestments. The issue of age enhancement was considered by the Board of\nTrustees in 9th Meeting held on 20.08.1999 along with the issue of payment\nof pension on revised salaries and it was felt that actuarial valuation was\nrequired. The agenda was again considered in the 12th Board Meeting held\non 02.08.2000, 13th Board Meeting held on 11.10.2000, 14th Board Meeting\nheld on 16.02.2001 and 15th Board Meeting held on 08.06.2001. In the 14th\nand 15th meetings, there was discussion on the increase in annuity rates as\nalso return on investments. Board of Trustees decided that since there was\nincrease of about 20% in the cost of annuity purchased from LIC and\nreduction in interest rates on investment from 12.5% to 10.5% per annum,\nmembers' contributions should increase correspondingly. However, it was\nalso decided that till actuarial valuation report was received regarding the\nimpact of these factors on the 1995 Scheme, pension should continue on the\npre-revised salaries.\n\n19.

However,\nemployees did not agree to the increase in contributions. In the 18th meeting\nheld on 28.12.2001, Actuary was asked to study various alternatives of the\nbenefit and contribution structure and make a detailed presentation in the\nnext meeting. Board of Trustees also took a second opinion from Mercer\nHuman Resource Consulting ('Mercer'). It was highlighted by the\nConsultant that there was a deficit of Rs.1,443.82 crores as against total\nliability of Rs.2,226.02 crores.\n\n20. A communication was issued by the then Senior Manager (HR) on\n03.07.2002 to all Heads of HR in each project, highlighting the change in\nassumptions and informing that: (i) Pension Scheme was viable only if there\nwas 50% increase in the members' contributions; (ii) private insurance\ncompanies when contacted for purchase of annuities were unable to offer\nanything in the near future; and (iii) Income Tax Authorities were contacted\nto modify the rules allowing a direct disbursement of pension by the Trust.\nFeedbacks were sought from the employees and meetings were held at\ndifferent levels with the employees' association and in fact NEFI\nrepresenting the Executive cadre sought closure of the 1995 Scheme.\nHowever, all efforts to continue the Scheme in its present form failed and\nhence, in the 20th Board Meeting held on 20.12.2002, Trustees decided to\nrestructure the Pension Scheme and make payment of pension on the basis\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 38 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nof actual contributions by the members and pro rata interest earned by the\nTrust on such contributions. Thus, the nature of the Scheme changed from\nDefined Benefit to Defined Contribution and it was decided that in all cases\nof retirement on or after 01.04.2002, payment would be made as per the\namended Scheme. Employee-wise account was created from earlier pool\nfund and contribution of the employee was utilized to pay pension only to\nthat employee. Element of cross-subsidy amongst employees was\neliminated. Under the restructured 2003 Scheme, there was no linkage either\nwith last drawn salary of the member or the length of service.\n\n21. Accordingly, PTC 17/2003 was issued implementing the 2003\nScheme and under the said Scheme purchase value of annuity remained\nlimited to 'Actual Accumulated Contribution' of an employee. The\nAccumulated Contribution paid by each employee till September, 2002\nalong with pro rata earnings was credited into the individual account of the\nemployee. Initially, for collection of contributions, Executive and\nSupervisors were divided into categories 'A' and 'B', however, pursuant to\n25th Meeting of the Trustees on 23.07.2004, the categories were merged.\nExecutives and Supervisors now contributed a Fixed Percentage of the\nSalary being 1% of the Basic Pay and Additional Contribution of Rs.388/-\nper month from April, 2003 along with a one-time lumpsum Contribution of\nRs.3,401/- in the month of April, 2004.\n\n22. In the 27th Board Meeting held on 29.04.2005, it was resolved that\nmonthly Pension payable to all employees will be uniform and for Financial\nYear 2005-06, contribution will be Rs.453/- per month, which constituted\nsurrender value of Washing Allowance of Rs.147/- per month, Tea Subsidy\nComponent of cash and Canteen Compensation of Rs.306/-. Additionally, a\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 39 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nsum of Rs.3,967/- was payable in the month of April, 2005, which was\nreimbursement value of summer liveries for the year 2005. This was\ncommunicated earlier to all employees vide Circular dated 15.04.2005.\nTherefore, pension payable to an employee under 2003 Scheme was the\ncontribution of the employee plus interest on it till the date of his\nsuperannuation. Where an employee decided to withdraw his contribution\nbefore superannuation to invest in other pension schemes, his contribution\nretained with the Trust was reduced according to withdrawal and interest\ncontinued to accumulate on the balance amount.\n\n23. The fact the Scheme as originally conceived could not work was\nfound in both the actuarial reports i.e. report dated 15.02.2007 by M/s. A.K.\nPandit and report dated 10.06.2008 by M/s. Watson and Wyatt. The change\nin 1995 Scheme did not infringe any vested rights of the Petitioners as 1995\nScheme was never conceived as a never ending Scheme. Review of the\nworking of the scheme was engrained in the Scheme as a continuous process\nand entitlement of pension was contingent upon revision of the contributions\nby members, which they refused to increase. If the Trust became unviable,\nthere was no way the Scheme could have continued in its present form. It\nwould be travesty of justice to remaining employees if the Scheme\ncontinued, as with the depletion of the Trust Fund there would be nothing\nremaining for the future employees.\n\n24. The decision to restructure the 1995 Scheme was not a hasty decision\nand was taken after due deliberations and consideration. Process of review\nof contributions and benefit structure was started from the year 2000 itself.\nConsultative process was adopted and matter was discussed at length with\nstakeholders such as different unions, employees' associations, Actuaries,\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 40 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nBoard of Trustees etc. It is not correct for the Petitioners to contend that they\nwere not put to notice before allegedly adversely reducing the pensions as\nthey were duly represented in most of the meetings through their Unions etc.\nand in fact, the Unions and Associations requested for the 1995 Scheme to\nbe terminated forthwith as they were not willing to deposit extra\ncontributions. It was neither feasible nor practical to expect NTPC or the\nTrust to take individual consent from each employee being thousands in\nnumbers. In any case, mere amendment in a Pension Scheme does not and\ncannot tantamount to change in service conditions of the Petitioners as it is\nalways open to an employer to fix a cut-off date, which in the present case\nwas taken after weighing the pros and cons of continuing the 1995 Scheme\nand the viability of the Trust Fund and was not arbitrary.\n\n25. It is clear from a reading of the Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997 that\nwhile the Trust was irrevocable, the Deed itself envisaged a provision for\nalteration, addition or amendment to the Deed and power to alter emanated\nfrom Clause 8 of the Deed, which provides that the Trustees may at any time\nwith the consent of NTPC or on its recommendation by a Supplementary\nDeed amend or add to the provision of the Trust Deed or the Rules. Much\nwas argued by the Petitioners that a condition precedent to amendment of\nthe Deed was that there should be no adverse effect on the benefits being\npaid to the employees, overlooking the fact that 1995 Scheme was never\nintended for the benefit of an individual employee but was for the collective\ninterest of the whole class of employees and once it could not address the\nlarger interest, it had to be restructured. Petitioners have accepted the 1995\nScheme with all its terms and cannot question the change. [Ref.\nUnion of\nIndia and Others v. N. Murugesan and Others\n, (2022) 2 SCC 25].

In any case, the\nonly effect of delayed approval would be that the Trustees shall be held\nliable for tax implications on the contributions received as per Rule 9 of\nSchedule 4, Part B of 1961 Act but this cannot invalidate the changes made\nin the Pension Scheme.\n\n26. Petitioners have completely glossed over the fact that the 1995\nScheme was a purely, voluntary, self-contributory scheme and not a\nstatutory pension scheme. The Scheme was not a part of the conditions of\nservice of the Petitioners and was brought in as an added benefit and\ntherefore, it is not open to the Petitioners to even argue that by the change in\nScheme, there is an adverse effect on their service conditions. The Trust was\ncreated with a purpose of regulating and managing the Pension Scheme and\nNTPC/Trust cannot be saddled with any liability if the Trust became\nunviable.\n\n27. Petitioners wrongly contend that they have paid full amount of Past\nService Contributions with interest. Recovery with respect to Past Service\nContribution was stopped from 01.09.2002. The Scheme itself envisaged\nrecovery in 120 installments starting from October, 1997 and therefore, only\n50% of the 120 installments was actually paid by the members and all\ncontributions made were credited to their respective accounts along with due\ninterest. From September, 2002, amount of Additional Contribution was\nreduced to Rs.360/- per month and lumpsum contribution of Rs.3,149/- was\npaid annually while Rs.5,508/- was payable once in three years. Moreover,\nFixed Percentage Contribution payable at the rate of 1% to 5% of the salary\ndepending upon of age of the member, was initially reduced to 1% for all\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 42 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nage groups from September, 2002 onwards and altogether stopped from\nDecember, 2003. From April, 2012 onwards, no contribution was recovered.\n\n28. NTPC Trust has filed a plethora of financial documents during the\nhearing of the petitions but there were no substantive arguments by the\nPetitioners to controvert them. The viability of the 1995 Scheme was\ndetermined as per actuarial valuation by qualified Actuaries, who are experts\nin the field. Long term viability of the Pension Scheme is determined by an\nActuary based on sources of contributions to the funds (contributions\npayable by the Member and earnings from investments) and total liability of\npension payment for all members as per benefit structure of the Scheme;\ncurrent and expected annuity rates; mortality and morbidity data; and\nemployees' age profile etc. Before amendment of the Scheme to defined\ncontribution pattern, expert Actuaries undertook a detailed exercise and\ndeliberated on many alternatives: (a) payment of pension on notional salary\nwith some assumed increase in the salary instead of calculation of pension\non actual salary; (b) calculate pension in two parts i.e. separate pension\ncalculation for service rendered upto 01.01.1997 (pension to be calculated\nbased on salary drawn as on 31.12.1996) and second, to calculate pension\nbased on service on or after 01.01.1997 till date of separation of an\nemployee; (c) refund of annuity purchase price to the Trust instead of return\nto the nominee; and (d) multiple time increase in contribution payable by the\nemployees. On a holistic exercise, it was found that only restructuring of the\nScheme would be in the interest of the collective of the employees.\n\n29. Petitioners wrongly rely on the judgment of the Supreme Court in\nMohd. Yunus. Firstly, the judgment is not a judgment in rem. Secondly,\nvalidity of Circular dated 03.02.2003, impugned in the present petition was\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 43 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nnever challenged and thirdly, most of the members of Petitioner No.1 have\nsuperannuated much after the 2003 Scheme being notified while Mohd.\nYunus retired prior to the notification of the 2003 Scheme. Moreover, the\nTrust had not provided complete details of the Actuary reports and financial\nimpact on the Trust Fund before the Allahabad High Court. The judgment\ndoes not decide the workability of the pension Trust or the legality of the\n2003 Scheme and it is for this reason that the Supreme Court remanded the\npresent writ petitions for a hearing on merits. Reliance was placed on the\nfollowing judgments:-\n\n(\nA) Deccan Paper Mills Company Limited v. Regency Mahavir\nProperties and Others\n, (2021) 4 SCC 786.\n\n(\nB) State of Uttar Pradesh and Others v. Arvind Kumar\nSrivastava and Others\n, (2015) 1 SCC 347\n(C) State of Orissa and Another v.

There can be no dispute with the\nlegal proposition that doctrine of delay and laches is a well-recognized\ndoctrine and from time to time, the Supreme Court has held that doctrine of\ndelay and laches or for that matter limitation are statutes of repose and peace\nand rest on foundations of greater public interest. It is, however, equally\nsettled that if in every case an argument against relief, which is otherwise\navailable to a party and just, is founded on mere delay, validity of that\ndefence must be tried on principles of equity, save and except, where there is\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 44 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\na statutory bar to condone the delay. It is also settled that law recognizes a\ncontinuing cause of action which may give rise to a recurring cause of action\nas in the case of salary or pension. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme\nCourt in\nM.R. Gupta v. Union of India and Others\n, (1995) 5 SCC 628, in\n\nUnion of India and Others v. Tarsem Singh\n, (2008) 8 SCC 648, the\nSupreme Court held that it is the very essence of a continuing wrong that it\nis an act which creates a continuing source of injury and renders the doer of\nthe act responsible and liable for continuance of the injury. If the wrongful\nact is of such a character that injury caused continues then the act constitutes\na continuing wrong. It was further held that normally, a belated service\nrelated claim will be rejected on ground of delay and laches in a writ petition\nbut one of the exceptions to the rule is in cases relating to continuing wrong\nand where the claim is based on a continuing wrong, relief can be granted\neven if there is a long delay in seeking the remedy, with reference to the date\non which the continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing wrong\ncreates a continuing source of injury. Of-course, there is an exception to the\nexception where the grievance effects rights of third parties which in the\nmeantime have crystallized such as in cases of seniority or promotion. The\nSupreme Court observed that if the issue relates to payment or re-fixation of\npay or pension, relief may be granted in spite of delay as it does not affect\nrights of third parties.\n\n31. By these writ petitions, Petitioners ventilate their grievances with\nrespect to re-fixation of their pension on account of restructuring in a\nPension Scheme, which has impacted their monthly pension and thus there\ncan be little doubt that their cause is a continuous cause arising out of a\ncontinuing injury and the judgment in\nTarsem Singh\n(supra), will apply in\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 45 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nall four corners. Be that as it may, I am of the view that there is no\ninordinate delay in filing the writ petitions and the reason is not far to seek.\nIt is true that the restructured 2003 Scheme was introduced on 03.02.2003.\nHowever, it cannot be overlooked that having introduced the Scheme, the\nPension Trust was continuing to have deliberations and discussions on the\nrevival of the 1995 Scheme and in fact, the original Trust Deed was\namended by the Supplementary Trust Deed only on 09.08.2011 and\nsignificantly, even the approval by the CIT was given on 06.02.2013. All\nthis while, Petitioners were hopeful that the 1995 Scheme may be restored.\n\nPertinently, a categorical stand is taken in most of the writ petitions that\nwhenever Petitioners represented, orally or in writing, protesting against the\nrestructuring of the Pension Scheme, they were asked to await the outcome\nof the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of\nMohd. Yunus\n(supra) as\neven the Respondents lacked clarity on the validity and applicability of 2003\nScheme. This argument is even otherwise without any basis for the singular\nreason that the Supreme Court remanded these writ petitions to be heard on\nmerits conscious of when the writ petitions were filed. The order does not\nindicate that the issue of delay and laches was left open to be decided by this\nCourt considering that the Supreme Court was examining the judgment of\nthe Division Bench dated 01.11.2018, where Pension Trust had categorically\nraised an objection qua some of the writ petitions that they were barred by\ndelay and laches. In light of this, the preliminary objection raised by the\nPension Trust is rejected.\n\n32. Genesis of the disputes between the parties in the present writ\npetitions lies in 1995 Scheme introduced by NTPC vide\nCPC\nNo. 354/1997\ndated 09.10.1997.

Looking into these demands, Ministry of Programme\nImplementation, DPE, Government of India, vide O.M. dated 12.04.1991,\nissued a directive that individual PSEs may 'work out a suitable Annuity\nScheme through LIC, based on purely voluntary contributions made by the\nemployees to a fund outside the PSE without any liability on the\nPSE/Government'. It was also decided that Management contribution to the\nSuperannuation Fund would be restricted to Rs.100/- per annum for all\nemployees of the PSE, taken together.\n\n33. Pursuant to the said O.M., Board of Directors of NTPC in the 141st\nmeeting held on 18.03.1994, approved the introduction of a Self-\ncontributory Superannuation Benefit (Pension) Scheme to be administered\nthrough a Pension Trust. Ministry of Power, Government of India gave its\nin-principle approval for introduction of a pension scheme, vide letter dated\n18.05.1995. NTPC appointed M/s. K.A. Pandit as an Actuary and Actuarial\nValuation Report dated 28.04.1993, formulating salient features of the\npension scheme, was received from the Actuary, wherein the assumptions\nconsidered for valuation were: (a) Future Salary increase @ 7% p.a.;\n\n(b) Return on Investment of Trust Fund @ 12%; and (c) Annuity rate of\nLIC-100 times of monthly pension under Pension for Life with Return of\nCapital to Nominee option, Mortality in service @ LIC table of 1970-73\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 47 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n(3.45 death per 1000).\n\n34. Subsequently, a revised Actuarial Valuation Report dated 16.03.1994\nwas received, as per which total value of pension liability at that time was\nassessed at Rs.154.66 crores, to be funded by Percentage Salary\nContribution ranging from 1% to 5% depending on the age of the employee\nalong with Additional Contribution of Rs.280/- per month per employee,\nescalated at the rate of 8% per annum. An MoU was executed on 07.03.1997\nbetween NTPC and NEFI and SEJC, wherein it was mutually agreed to\nformulate a Self-Contributory Superannuation Benefit (Pension) Scheme for\nbenefit of all NTPC employees and to create a Pension Trust to manage and\nadminister the Scheme. It was also agreed that NTPC's contribution shall be\nlimited to Rs.100/- per annum for all employees taken together and rest of\ncontribution will be by employees to make the Scheme financially viable\nand the contributions were to be deducted from the salaries of the employees\non a monthly basis. Executives and the Supervisors, who were on roll of\nNTPC on the date of signing of the MoU as also those who joined in future,\nwere to compulsorily become members of the Scheme. The percentage of\ncontributions as also Additional Contribution were prescribed in the MoU.\nClause D.4.1 provided that three Trustees would be from Executives'\nAssociation and three from Supervisors' Association as nominated and\nseven were to be nominated by the Management including the Chairman of\nthe Trust for managing the Trust properties. It was decided that NTPC shall\nexecute a Trust Deed and frame Rules for proper implementation of the\nPension Scheme with the approval of CMD, NTPC or any other authorized\nofficer. Trust was to be registered with the Registrar of Assurances.\n\n35. Clause D.4.3 provided that income tax exemption will be obtained to\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 48 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nthe effect that income of the Trust will not be chargeable to income tax.\nClause D.4.5 stipulated that MoU shall be irrevocable and remain operative\nand effective in perpetuity till the Pension Scheme continues to be in\noperation. Salient features of the Scheme were enumerated in Annexure-1 to\nthe MoU and were integral part of the MoU. Clause D.4.7 categorically\nprovided that MoU shall become effective for all purposes and intents\nfrom 01.04.1995 and recoveries/contributions shall start from 01.04.1995\nand all employees on the rolls of NTPC as on 01.04.1995 shall make\ncontributions.\n\n36. Trust Deed was executed on 12.03.1997 and Rules were framed. Soon\nthereafter, the 1995 Scheme was introduced on 09.10.1997 with approval of\nCIT on 11.06.1997. The Scheme became operational and several Circulars\nwere issued thereafter from time to time regulating the deductions made\nfrom the employees towards contributions from past as well as present\nservice.\n\n37. The 1995 Scheme was a defined benefit scheme and the corpus of the\nTrust Fund was funded by contributions from the members through:\n\n(a) monthly Percentage Salary Contributions fixed as per the employee's\nage; (b) Past Service Contributions; and (c) Monthly Additional\nContributions. Being in the nature of a 'Defined Benefit' Scheme, the 1995\nScheme asssured pension at the rate of 1.25% per annum per year of\nReckonable Service, limited to 50% of last drawn salary and for Reckonable\nService less than 40 years, benefit was proportionately reduced. Therefore,\nthe 1995 Scheme had a direct linkage to the last drawn salary and\nReckonable Service and clearly, the pension was pre-defined. Reckonable\nService as defined in the Rules was total of Escalated Future Service + Past\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 49 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nContinuous Service and Salary included Basic Pay + Dearness Allowance.\n\nThe sum of three contributions was deposited in a Pool Account of the\nPension Trust to make a corpus and the money in the corpus was to be\nutilized by the Trust to buy annuities from LIC, as and when an employee\nsuperannuated, died etc. The Trust invested the contributions in approved\nsecurities as per Government Guidelines and provisions of 1961 Act.\n\n38. There was a paradigm shift in 2000 with respect to the working of the\n1995 Scheme and viability of the Trust Fund and the trigger, as brought\nforth by the Respondents, was revision in salaries of the NTPC employees\nw.e.f. 01.01.1997, following the ten years wage revision pattern in PSEs.\nThis and several other factors, as brought out above, eventually led to\nintroduction of the 2003 Scheme, which was a 'Defined Contribution'\nScheme in contrast to the 1995 Scheme, which was a 'Defined Benefit'\nScheme. Under the restructured 2003 Scheme, pension was to be calculated\nbased on actual contributions by the members and interest credited by the\nTrust on such contributions with no linkage to last drawn salary or length of\nservice and the purchase value of annuity remained limited to the 'Actual\nAccumulated Contribution' of an employee. Aggrieved by the restructuring\nof the 1995 Scheme, one Mohd. Yunus, an ex-employee of NTPC who\nretired on 31.07.2002, approached the Allahabad High Court and vide\njudgment dated 17.12.2009, the Court held that he was entitled for pension\nunder the 1995 Scheme. The judgment was challenged by Pension Trust\nbefore the Supreme Court but the Civil Appeal was dismissed on 09.12.2015\non the ground that rights of Mohd. Yunus crystalized on the date of his\nretirement and any future Scheme, Rules or Guidelines, including 2003\nScheme, would be inapplicable to him.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 50 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n39. At the cost of repetition, I may note that in the present batch of\npetitions, in writ petitions, bearing W.P. (C) Nos. 2327/2016, 2092/2016,\n9539/2016, 6179/2016, 2289/2016, 4839/2016 and 2010/2016, Petitioners\nare those members of the 1995 Scheme who retired prior to 03.02.2003\nwhile Petitioners in the other writ petitions, save and except one, are those\nwho retired post 03.02.2003, the date on which the 2003 Scheme was\nintroduced albeit retrospectively to apply to all cases of superannuation after\n01.04.2002 and to cases of death while in service/total incapacitation after\n31.08.2002, except cases already settled by the Trust. Some members of\nPetitioner No. 1 in W.P.(C) 6357/2019 are also retirees prior to 03.02.2003.\n\n40. The moot question that arises for consideration before this Court is\nwhether the Petitioners will be governed by 1995 Scheme or the restructured\n2003 Scheme. But before examining the said questions, it is important to\nsegregate the Petitioners in two categories.\nIn my view, cases of Petitioners\nwho retired prior to 03.02.2003 cannot be placed on the same pedestal as\nthose who retired post the said date as they are squarely covered by the\njudgment of the Supreme Court in\nMohd. Yunus\n(supra). Therefore, in\nthese cases, this Court need not enter into deciding the vexed question of\nvalidity of the 2003 Scheme, which cannot be made applicable to them\nretrospectively.\n\n41. The case of Mohd. Yunus before the Allahabad High Court was that\nsince he had attained the age of superannuation on 31.07.2002, he was\nentitled for payment of pension under the 1995 Scheme. Agreeing with\nMohd. Yunus, Allahabad High Court held that he would be entitled for\npayment of post-retiral dues in accordance with the 1995 Scheme, existing\non the date of his retirement and any change made subsequently shall not\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 51 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\naffect his rights and accordingly, direction was issued to pay his post-retiral\ndues as per the 1995 Scheme. The judgment was carried in appeal, which\nwas dismissed by the Supreme Court on 09.12.2015, holding that retiral\nbenefits of Mohd. Yunus crystalized on the date of his retirement i.e.\n31.07.2002 and any rules or guidelines notified thereafter including the 2003\nScheme could not be made applicable to him. Applying the aforesaid\njudgment, cases of Petitioners who retired prior to 03.02.2003, will be\ngoverned by the 1995 Scheme and the 2003 Scheme, which was introduced\npost their retirement will be inapplicable. The action of the Pension Trust to\nmake the scheme retrospectively applicable to retirees from 01.04.2002 to\ntake away their vested rights which crystallised on the dates of their\nrespective retirements, cannot be sustained.\n\n42. The argument made on behalf of the Pension Trust that the judgment\nis not a judgment in rem has no force. Supreme Court dismissed the appeal\nholding that settled and crystallised right of Mohd. Yunus to receive pension\nat the time of retirement cannot be adversely affected by any subsequent\nchange in a scheme or policy by giving it a retrospective effect. The ratio is\ncertainly applicable to the present cases and binding. Even otherwise, it is a\nwell settled proposition of law that once an employee retires under the\nexisting pension scheme, his right crystallizes on the said date and\nsubsequent change in the pension scheme cannot take away the said vested\nright, retrospectively. Amendment if any, can only operate prospectively.\n[Ref.:\nPunjab State Cooperative Agricultural Development Bank Limited\nv.

The next question that arises is as to what relief can be given to these\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 52 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nPetitioners considering that many years have elapsed from the respective\ndates of their retirements as also considering that the 1995 Scheme was a\nSelf-Contributory Scheme requiring the members to contribute Fixed\nPercentage Monthly Salaries, Monthly Additional Contributions and Past\nService Contributions. To answer this question, I am guided by the judgment\nof the Supreme Court in\nUniversity of Delhi v. Shashi Kiran and Others\n,\n(2022) 15 SCC 325. In the said case, the primary issue before the Supreme\nCourt in the Shashi Kiran batch of cases was whether having opted for CPF\nwhile in service upto the cut off date consciously, the employees could\nexercise an option to switch over to GPF for grant of pension. The Supreme\nCourt upheld the judgment of the Division Bench permitting the Appellants\nin the said batch to switch over so that they could receive pension. Since the\nlitigation took many years to conclude, the second question that arose before\nthe Supreme Court was as to the financial impact of the decision of the\nDivision Bench. In this context, the Supreme Court examined that the Shashi\nKiran batch of cases involved only 75 persons and the shift of those\nemployees from CPF to GPF would not in any manner affect the strength\nand character of the Fund as also considering that the original Petitioners\nhad approached the Court in 2010. It was further held that at this length of\ntime, it is not as if any floodgates would be opened or there will be a drain\non the resources of the State. In this light, the Supreme Court held that the\ndecision of the Division Bench did not warrant interference with the caveat\nthat original Petitioner would recoup the contribution under CPF with\ninterest. Mindful of the fact that years had elapsed in the litigation and some\nof the employees may not be interested in switching over to GPF since it\nentailed recouping the contribution under CPF, the Supreme Court directed\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 53 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nthat option must be given to them to decide if they wanted to switch over to\nGPF at that point of time.\n\n44. In the present case, Trust has taken a stand in the counter affidavit,\nwhich is uncontroverted, that recoveries with respect to Past Service\nContribution were stopped from 01.09.2002 and Additional Contributions\npayable monthly were reduced to Rs.360/-. Therefore, wherever part\ncontributions were not made till the date of retirements, the contributions as\nenvisaged in the 1995 Scheme shall have to be made to recoup the corpus of\nthe Trust Fund. However, with the passage of over two decades and at this\ndistant point in time, it may be possible that some of these Petitioners or\ntheir beneficiaries may not be interested in recouping the balance\ncontributions under the 1995 Scheme. The only way to resolve this issue\nwill be to direct the Pension Trust to give an option to these Petitioners or\ntheir beneficiaries, as the case may be, to contribute to the corpus and\nwherever the option is favourably exercised, the member shall make the\nrequired contribution, upon which the 1995 Scheme will apply and Defined\nBenefits envisaged under the said Scheme will be granted along with\narrears. Be it ingeminated that the total number of these Petitioners is\nminiscule and therefore, in any event, there is no apprehension of opening\nfloodgates or any significant financial impact on the Pension Trust Fund.\n\n45. Coming now to the Petitioners who retired post 03.02.2003. The\nsubmissions of the Petitioners, eloquently articulated by their learned\nSenior Counsel can be encapsulated as: (a) 2003 Scheme cannot apply\nretrospectively to those who were members of the 1995 Scheme when the\nsame was introduced and had contributed to the corpus of the Trust; (b) the\nrestructured Scheme adversely affected the pension of the members of the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 54 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n1995 Scheme and therefore, the alteration/amendment was wholly illegal in\nlight of the embargo in Clause 8 of the Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997; and\n\n(c) albeit there is no quarrel with respect to the powers of the Trustees to\namend or add to the provisions of the Trust Deed dated 12.03.1997, but the\nsame could only be done by the mechanism and procedure provided in\nClause 8 of the said Deed, which stipulated that any alteration or addition to\nthe Trust Deed will be with the consent of NTPC or on its recommendation\nby a Supplementary Deed and with the prior approval of the CIT and in the\npresent case, there was no prior approval, as admittedly CIT gave his\napproval on 06.02.2013 retrospectively from 01.04.2002 and the\nSupplementary Deed was executed on 09.08.2011 and therefore, at the\nhighest, 2003 Scheme would take effect from 06.02.2013.\n\n46. Indisputably, the 1995 Scheme was introduced by NTPC in\nfurtherance of the Directive of the Government in O.M. dated 12.04.1991,\nwhereby individual PSEs were to work out a suitable Annuity Scheme\nthrough LIC on purely voluntary contributions by the employees and the\nScheme was to be administered through a Trust by constituting a Pension\nFund. The liability of NTPC as a PSE was limited to Rs.100/- per annum for\nthe total employees taken together and remaining contribution was by\nthe employees. It needs emphasis that there are no allegations of\nmismanagement or maladministration of the Trust Fund or misfeasance or\nembezzlement by the Trustees. In fact, no serious arguments were canvassed\non behalf of the Petitioners to controvert the financial documents, including\nactuarial reports or balance sheets etc., placed on record by the Trust, despite\nhearings post the filing of these documents.\n\n47. The main plank of the argument of the Pension Trust is that the 1995\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 55 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nScheme was not one etched in stone or immutable and by the very nature of\nthe Scheme it was vulnerable to discontinuation and to say the least subject\nto periodic reviews for which purpose Actuaries had to be kept engaged in\norder to scrutinize the availability of funds and consequently the viability of\nthe Trust and the Scheme.\n\n48. One thing that comes out clearly from a close perusal of the\ndocuments on record as also arguments of the respective parties is that in\nless than 3 years from when the 1995 Scheme was introduced in the year\n1997 albeit with effect from 01.04.1995, serious issues started cropping up\nwith respect to the viability of the Scheme. Respondents attribute this to\nvarious factors such as enhancement in the age of retirement of employees\nfrom 58 to 60 years; increase in the salaries first of the Executives and then\nof the Supervisors followed by the workmen from 01.01.1997; increase in\nrates of purchase of annuities from LIC; and decline in return on\ninvestments. Plethora of financial documents have been placed on record by\nthe Respondents jointly which include minutes of several meetings of Board\nof Trustees, balance sheets, communications with LIC and the\nrepresentatives of Unions and Associations of the employees, the main\nstakeholders, as also Actuarial Reports by different Actuaries, being experts\nin their field, with the purpose of showing that the Scheme was not viable in\nits present form with the contemplated incoming contributions as also to\nshow the bona fides in making every possible attempt to keep the 1995\nScheme viable and ongoing. It would be pertinent to refer to some of these\ndocuments in order to examine whether there is any force in the submissions\nof the Respondents.\n\n49.

Both the reports dated 28.04.1993 and 16.03.1994 indicate that the\nassumptions considered during the actuarial valuation were: (a) Future\nSalary increase @ 7% p.a.; (b) Return on Investment of Trust Fund @ 12%;\nand (c) Annuity rate of LIC-100 times of monthly pension under Pension for\nLife with Return of Capital to Nominee option. The total liability was\nassessed at Rs.154.66 crore to be funded by Percentage Salary Contribution\nranging from 1 to 5% and Additional Contribution of Rs.280/- per month\nescalated at the rate of 8% per annum.\n\n50. After the age of retirement was enhanced and salaries were revised in\nNTPC in 2000, Board of Trustees held a meeting on 21.08.2000 to assess\nthe impact of the changed circumstances and to see if the Trust was\neconomically viable. Presentation was called for from the Actuary and as\nsuggested, actual data of revised pay was called for while deciding that for\nthe time being, pension will be paid on pre-revised salaries. In the 13th\nmeeting held on 11.10.2000, it was felt that increase in employees'\ncontribution will be required to keep the Trust viable and the rate of\nAdditional Contribution was revised to Rs.915/- from 01.04.2000. Circular\ndated 15.11.2000 was issued for increase in Additional Contribution for\nFinancial Year 2000-01 for Executives. In the 14th meeting held on\n16.02.2001, the impact of wage revision of workmen and Supervisors as\nalso increase in purchase price of annuity by LIC and lower rate of return on\ninvestment was discussed again. Details of investments made during the\nyear 2000-01 was also circulated for consideration.\n\n51.

These issues were again deliberated\nupon extensively in the 15th meeting of the Board of Trustees held on\n08.06.2001. It was brought forth in the meeting by the Secretary of the Trust\nthat increase in annuity rates of LIC was about 19 to 20% and reduction in\ninterest rates was approximately from 12.5 to 11% in one year. In the same\nmeeting, Trustees also discussed various alternate modules to make the fund\nviable such as: (a) determination of rate of contribution based on single\npercentile contribution rate varying with age group; (b) payment of pension\non fixed salary escalation instead of last drawn salary; and (c) return of\ncapital amount to the Trust instead of going to individual nominee.\nPossibility of giving loans to the Trust against bonds for good investment\nwas also discussed.\n\n52. In the 18th meeting held on 28.12.2001 elaborate discussions took\nplace on the Pension Scheme and views were expressed by Trustees\nnominated by NEFI and Supervisory Associations and Unions as also views\nof Management Trustees. After taking the respective views, it was decided\nthat the Actuary would study the various alternatives of benefit and\ncontribution structures to suggest alternatives including one with which\nbasic benefit structure does not change and in the meantime, pension was to\nbe paid treating the salary as 2/3rd of the salary drawn as an ad hoc measure.\n\n53.

In\nfurtherance thereof, efforts were made to explore any alternate agency for\npurchasing the annuity, however, inter-office Memo dated 03.07.2002\nshows that none of the agencies contacted was in a position to offer the\nservices.\n\n54. Respondents have also placed on record the report by Mercer\nindicating the detailed exercise undertaken to study the impact of rise in\nannuity rates, salaries and reduction in interest regime as also to analyse the\nway forward. It was inter alia recommended that: (a) under current\ncircumstances, it may be necessary to buy annuity from LIC; (b) annuity\nwith return of corpus would be a costly proposition and life annuity with a\nten years guarantee period was more feasible option being cost effective\nwith a return of significant portion of purchase price; (c) accrual rate of\npension at 1.25% was difficult to sustain unless the option of frozen past\nservice pension was adopted; and (d) accrual rate of pension of 1% was\nfeasible if contribution rates were enhanced as suggested.\n\n55. Another significant document relied upon by the Trust is a\ncommunication dated 10.09.2002 from Secretary General, NEFI addressed\nto CMD, NTPC wherein it is stated that during the course of NEFI's\ninteraction with the Management on 07.08.2002, a presentation was made\nproposing 3 models as alternatives, as suggested by the Actuaries, however,\nas discussed in the subsequent meeting held on 10.09.2002, it was resolved\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 59 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nafter due deliberations that since none of the three models inspire\nconfidence, the Scheme be foreclosed and recovery from salaries of the\nExecutives on this count be stopped forthwith.\n\n56. In light of all this, 20th meeting of the Board of Trustees was held on\n19.12.2002. It is recorded in the minutes of the meeting that restructuring of\nthe 1995 Scheme was under review for quite some time as review was\nneeded in light of changes in the economic scenario in the country as well as\ndownward changes in the interest rates. Consequently, certain assumptions\nmade by formulating this Scheme by Actuaries also underwent substantial\nchanges. Detailed discussions held in various Trust meetings yielded no\nuseful solutions and no consensus could be reached on either the change in\nbenefit structure or contributions. It is also noted that pending the decision,\npension payments to employees retired after 01.04.2002 had been kept in\nabeyance. After deliberation, it was resolved that the Self-Contributory\nDefined Benefit Scheme must give way to the Defined Contributory Scheme\nand pension would be then payable on the actual contribution of the\nemployee. In furtherance thereof, PTC 16/2002 was issued circulating the\nchange in the contribution structure for the Executive as follows:-\n\n\"NTPC LTD.

From the aforementioned documents, it is\npalpably clear that the decision to restructure the 1995 Scheme was not a\nhasty or an overnight decision. Serious attempts and efforts were made by\nthe Respondents to continue the existing Scheme and to explore all\npossibilities to make the same viable. Actuarial Reports were sought with\nrecommendations to work the Scheme. Request was made to LIC to reduce\nthe purchase price of annuities as that was a major factor impacting the\nworking of the Scheme financially. Several agencies were contacted to sell\nthe annuities on low price but none of the agencies were able to offer the\nannuities being new in the field. Three alternatives were suggested by the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 61 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nActuaries to continue the Scheme with some variations but neither of them\ncould be enforced. It is also pertinent to mention that at all stages, the\nEmployees' Associations and Unions were kept in the loop. They were\ninformed of the reasons for which the 1995 Scheme was no longer viable\nand that enhanced contributions from them could work towards making the\nScheme viable, however, as the Minutes of the Meetings indicate the\nemployees expressed their disinclination to enhance the contributions as\nsought and/or as recommended by the Actuaries. In fact, NEFI had sent a\nwritten communication to CMD, NTPC to foreclose the Scheme as they\nwere unable to enhance the contribution. Finally, a decision was taken to\nrestructure the Scheme with a different structure of contribution as also\nbenefits to the employees.\n\n58. The actuarial reports show that to maintain the existing pension\nbenefits Percentage Salary Contribution would have to be increased from 3\nto 8% or 2.75 times with an Additional Contribution of Rs.730/- per month\nescalated by 8% for Non-Executive or else if entire contribution was met\nfrom Percentage Salary Contribution, then it will be 6% to 25% i.e. 7.25\ntimes of the present rate with no Additional Contribution. For Executives,\nActuary informed that if only Percentage Salary Contribution was recovered\nit had to be 6% to 25% or 7 times of present rate with no Additional\nContribution or Additional Contribution at Rs.988/- per month with 8% per\nannum escalation etc. However, the employees were not willing to enhance\nthe contributions and pertinently on 07.02.2003, Supervisory Services\nAssociations sent a letter to Chairman of the Trust to implement the\nrestructured Pension Scheme with a rider that 1% of the Basic Pay deposited\nin the accounts of the individuals should not be diverted in the Death Pool\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 62 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nAccount and Additional Contribution should be only kept on surrender items\nwhich was Rs.788/- per month with escalation at 8% and no additional\ndeduction for Additional Contribution should be made. None of the\nAssociations were inclined to increase the Additional Contribution any\nfurther.\n\n59. Holistically seen, the restructuring was in the larger interest of all the\nmembers and based on the availability of Funds with the Trust. Several\nfactors cumulatively resulted in the decision to restructure the 1995 Scheme\nsuch as more than 50% increase in annuity rates by LIC of India, the annuity\nservice provider from 01.04.2002; salary revisions from 01.01.1997,\nActuary Reports suggesting manifold increase in contributions to sustain the\nScheme; employees and their representative bodies not agreeing to pay\nrevised contributions as suggested by the Actuaries. It was rightly flagged\nby the Respondents that long term viability of the Pension Scheme is\ndetermined by the Actuary Valuations based on sources of contributions to\nthe Funds by members and/or earnings from investments and total liability\nof pension for all members as per the Defined Benefit structure of the\nScheme, current and expected annuity rates, mortality and morbidity data,\nemployees' age profile etc. As noted above, before restructuring the 1995\nScheme, Actuaries had undertaken a detailed exercise of actuarial valuation\ndeliberating over several alternatives such as payment of pension on\nnotional salary with some assumed increase in salary instead of calculations\nof pension on actual salary. In fact, at some stage, it was also suggested to\ncalculate pension in two parts i.e. separate pension for service rendered prior\nto 01.01.1997 (pension to be calculated based on salary drawn as on\n31.12.1996) and second part to be calculated based on service on or after\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 63 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n01.01.1997 till date of separation of employees. Refund of annuity purchase\nprice to the Trust instead of return to nominee etc. was also discussed. In\nfact, even prior to introduction of the 1995 Scheme, actuary valuations were\ncarried out on certain assumptions as these valuations form the basis of\nformulating any Pension Scheme. Mr. Lekhi, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing for the Pension Trust rightly contended that even in the earlier\nActuary Report dated 16.03.1994, the Actuary had indicated present value of\npension as Rs.154.66 crore with the value of Percentage Salary Contribution\nbeing Rs.29.33 crore and the resultant deficit as Rs.125.33 crores. It was\nrecommended that the Actuarial valuation of the Scheme should be carried\nout every five years to monitor the Fund as this was how the viability could\nbe tested. The financial difficulties experienced by the Trust in operating the\n1995 Scheme is duly supported by detailed actuarial reports indicating a\ndeficit which would have made the Scheme unviable. Having analysed the\ndocuments and the financials, I am unable to come to a conclusion that the\naction of restructuring the 1995 Scheme was malafide or arbitrary or\nperverse.\n\n60. Petitioners are right in arguing that Clause 8 of the Trust Deed while\nempowering the Trustees to amend or add to the provision of the Trust Deed\nplaced two caveats on the Trustees. The first was that the amendment should\nnot adversely affect the benefits being paid from the Trust or accruing upto\nthe date of such amendment or the object of the Trust and the second being\nthe requirement of prior approval of the CIT. In fact, reading of Clause 8 of\nthe Trust Deed itself shows that the Pension Scheme was not cast in stone\nand the Trustees had the power to amend, alter or add to the Scheme. Insofar\nas the first condition is concerned, it is amply clear from the documents on\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 64 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nrecord that had the Scheme continued in its present form of contributions\nand defined benefits, it was unviable to run the Trust. Therefore, benefit of\nfew would have possibly resulted in discontinuing the Scheme totally and\nthis would have been detrimental to the larger interest of the collective of\nemployees and thus by restructuring and continuing the Scheme with a\ndifferent structure, the pension scheme could be sustained albeit with a\ndifferent structure.\nInsofar as the prior approval of the CIT is concerned,\nPension Trust has taken a stand, and in my view rightly so that at best, the\ndelayed approval would result in tax liabilities but this cannot invalidate the\nScheme and in this view, I am fortified by a judgment of the Co-ordinate\nBench of this Court in\nA.K. Saini & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n, 2015\nSCC OnLine Del 13637, where a similar contention was raised by the\nPetitioners that any amendment to the Trust Deed was permissible only with\nthe prior written approval of the Corporation and CIT. This contention was\nnegatived by the Court by holding that the third amendment was brought in\nto bring parity amongst the employees and the mere fact that it was not\napproved by CIT will not render the amendment void and at best it would\nonly deprive the Trust of tax benefits. In the present case, NTPC has stated\nin its separate affidavit that it had approved the restructuring of the Scheme\nand insofar as the CIT is concerned, approval was granted on 06.02.2013\nfrom 01.04.2002 and at the highest, the impact of the delayed approval\nwould be in the tax regime but this cannot be a reason to invalidate the 2003\nScheme brought in after due deliberations and considerations, taking into\naccount actuarial reports as also keeping all stakeholders in loop. Execution\nof the Supplementary Deed was only a ministerial act and no mileage can be\ndrawn by the Petitioners from its execution in 2011.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 65 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n61. It is a settled law that judicial review is concerned not with the\ndecision but with the decision-making process and a petition under\nArticle\nof the Constitution of India is for judicial review and not an appeal.\nSupreme Court has from time to time held that judicial review is not\nconcerned with the merits of the decision but the manner in which it was\ntaken.\nIn\nR v. Panel\non Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Guinness Plc,\nLord Donaldson, M.R. referred to the judicial review jurisdiction as being\nsupervisory or longstop jurisdiction and held that unless the restriction is\nobserved, the Court, under the guise of preventing abuse of power will be\nguilty of usurping the power.\n\nIn\nTata Cellular v. Union of India\n, (1994) 6\nSCC 651, the Supreme Court held that the duty of the Court is to confine\nitself to question of legality. Its concern should be: (a) whether the decision-\nmaking authority exceeds its powers; (b) commits an error of law; (c)\ncommits a breach of rules of natural justice; (d) reaches a decision which no\nreasonable authority would have reached; or (e) abused its power. Applying\nthese principles, in matters like the present one, this Court has only to see if\nthe restructuring of the Scheme is so irrational, arbitrary or perverse that it\ncannot be sustained in law. For all the aforesaid reasons, this Court is unable\nto reach a conclusion that the restructuring was irrational or perverse or that\nthe decision-making process was flawed or arbitrary.\n\n62. Insofar as the argument of the Petitioners that individual notices were\nnot given to the Petitioners before restructuring the Scheme which had an\nadverse impact on their pensions which were considerably reduced,\nsuffice would it be to hold that the representatives of the employees through\nvarious Unions and Associations were also associated with the process of\nrestructuring and their suggestions on the actuarial reports including the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 66 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\nadvise to increase the contributions to keep the Scheme viable were invited.\nIt was neither practical nor feasible for the Respondents to serve individual\nnotices on the Petitioners and in my view, there is no legal requirement for\nserving individual notices in matters of policy decisions pertaining to\nrestructuring of Pension Schemes.\n\n63. Before parting, it is pertinent to mention that the 1995 Scheme was\nintroduced on 09.10.1997 and within a short span of less than 3 years,\nquestions were raised on the viability of the Scheme and the Trustees started\nthe process of actuarial valuations. Therefore, the Scheme did not run for\nmore than five years albeit the deductions/recoveries were made from\n01.04.1995. Petitioners were completely aware of this process and the\npossible unviability of the Scheme and as per the uncontroverted stand of\nthe Respondents, recovery with respect to Past Service Contribution was\nstopped from 01.09.2002 and from the same date, amount of Additional\nContribution was also reduced to Rs.360/- per month. When the\nrestructuring took place, the Accumulated Contribution paid by each\nemployee till September, 2002 along with pro rata earnings was credited\ninto the individual account of the employee as under the 2003 Scheme,\npurchase value of annuity was limited to 'Actual Accumulated Contribution'\nof an employee. The present is not a case where the 1995 Scheme had a long\nspan giving rise to legitimate expectations and thus even on equity,\nPetitioners have no case to assert that this Court should direct the\nRespondents to restore the 1995 Scheme for retirees post 03.02.2003.\n\n64. In light of the above findings, W.P. (C) Nos. 2327/2016, 2092/2016,\n9539/2016, 6179/2016, 2289/2016, 4839/2016 and 2010/2016, are allowed\ndirecting that the Petitioners therein will be entitled to pension under the\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally Signed\n\nBy:KAMAL KUMAR W.P.(C) 6357/2019 and connected matters Page 67 of 68\n\nSigning Date:24.05.2025\n\n16:15:34\n\n1995 Scheme. However, keeping in view the long passage of time that has\nelapsed since their retirements, Respondents shall within six weeks from\ntoday give an option to these Petitioners/Beneficiaries, if they wish to\nreceive pension under the 1995 Scheme.
