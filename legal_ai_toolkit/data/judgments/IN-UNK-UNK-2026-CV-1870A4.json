A three-Judge Bench of this Court in this batch of\n\nmatters, vide order dated 12th August 2025, had referred the\n\nfollowing substantial questions of law for consideration of a\n\nConstitution Bench:\n\n (i) Whether a judicial officer who has already\n completed seven years in Bar being recruited for\n subordinate judicial services would be entitled\n for appointment as Additional District Judge\n against the Bar vacancy?\n\n (ii) Whether the eligibility for appointment as a\n District Judge is to be seen only at the time of\n appointment or at the time of application or\n both?\n\n2. When this batch of matters was listed for directions on\n\n12th September 2025, the following additional questions were\n\nalso framed by the Constitution Bench:\n\n (iii) Whether there is any eligibility prescribed for a\n person already in the judicial service of the\n Union or State under \nArticle 233(2)\n of the\n\n 5\n\f Constitution of India for being appointed as\n District Judge?\n\n (iv) Whether a person who has been Civil Judge for\n a period of seven years or has been an Advocate\n and Civil Judge for a combined period of seven\n years or more than seven years would be eligible\n for appointment as District Judge under \nArticle\n 233\n of the Constitution of India?\n\n3. For ease of convenience, the parties that support the\n\nproposition and contend that the questions framed be\n\nanswered in favour of in-service candidates and they be\n\npermitted to participate in direct recruitment for the post of\n\ndistrict judges will be referred to as the Petitioners and those\n\nopposing the proposition and contending that the direct\n\nrecruitment should be only from the category of advocates\n\nwith seven years’ practice will be referred to as the\n\nRespondents.\n\nB. SUBMISSIONS\n\n4. We have extensively heard Mr. Jayant Bhushan,\n\nMr. Arvind P. Datar, Mr. P.S. Patwalia, Mr. V. Giri, Ms. Vibha\n\nDatta Makhija, Mr. Jaideep Gupta, Dr. Manish Singhvi, Mr.\n\nDama Seshadri Naidu, Mr. George Poonthottam, Mr. Gopal\n\n 6\n\fSankaranarayanan, Dr. Menaka Guruswamy, Mr. Rajive\n\nBhalla, Mr. Anil Kaushik, Mr. Amit Anand Tewari, Mr. B.H.\n\nMarlapalle, Mr. Narendra Hooda and Mr. Anand Sanjay M.\n\nNuli learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nPetitioners.\n\n5. We have also extensively heard Mr. C.U. Singh, Mr.\n\nNidhesh Gupta, Mr. Vijay Hansaria, Mr. Ravindra Shrivastava,\n\nMr. Rajiv Shakdher learned Senior Counsel along with\n\nMr. Amit Gupta, Mr. Kanhaiya Singhal, Mr. Rashid N. Azam,\n\nMr. Sandeep Sudhakar Deshmukh, Ms. Sindoora VNL,\n\nMr. Yashvardhan, Ms. Kavya Jhawar and Ms. Nandini Rai\n\nlearned counsel for the Respondents and Mr. Siddharth Gupta\n\nand Mr. Satyam Chand Soriya for the intervenors.\n\n6. We have also perused the material painstakingly put\n\ntogether by Mr. Ajay Kumar Singh and Mr. John Mathew who\n\nassisted the Court as Nodal Counsel for the Parties.\n\n7. The gist of the arguments advanced by the learned\n\nSenior Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that:\n\n 7\n\f i. The judgment of this Court in Dheeraj Mor v. High\n\n Court of Delhi1 misreads \nArticle 233(2)\n of the\n\n Constitution.\n\n ii. The construction given by Dheeraj Mor (supra) to\n\n the effect that a person has to be presently an\n\n advocate or a pleader makes the words “a person\n\n not already in the service of Union or State” totally\n\n superfluous and redundant which cannot be\n\n permitted.2\n\n iii. A plain reading of \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution\n\n indicates that there are two sources/streams i.e.,\n\n either a person has to be in service of the Union or\n\n State (which has been held to be judicial service3)\n\n or he has to be an advocate or pleader for seven\n\n years. Once the person is already in judicial service,\n\n no further eligibility is prescribed for being\n\n appointed as a district judge as held by this Court\n\n1 (2020) 7 SCC 401\n2 Union of India and Another v. Hansoli Devi and Others (2002) 7 SCC 273.\n3 Chandra Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others 1966 SCC OnLine SC 35.\n\n 8\n\f in the case of Rameshwar Dayal v. The State of\n\n Punjab and Others4.\n\n iv. The interpretation excluding Civil Judges from\n\n being eligible to be appointed directly as district\n\n judges is unreasonable and against the interest of\n\n administration of justice. A person in judicial\n\n service would certainly be more experienced and\n\n more suitable for appointment. Any exclusion by\n\n the relevant rules would be violative of \nArticles 14\n\n and \n16\n of the Constitution.\n\n v. There is no requirement of any period of time or\n\n experience that a Civil Judge must possess to be\n\n eligible for direct recruitment as a district judge.\n\n \nArticle 233\n does not lay down any such\n\n requirement. In any case, if this Court deems it fit\n\n that there is such a requirement then seven years’\n\n experience as a Civil Judge or combined experience\n\n of seven years as an advocate and a Civil Judge\n\n would be sufficient. Reliance is also made in this\n\n4 1960 SCC OnLine SC 123\n\n 9\n\f respect on Explanation (aa) of \nArticle 217(2)\n of the\n\n Constitution.\n\n vi. The use of the words “has been” in \nArticle 233(2)\n of\n\n the Constitution means a state of affairs which had\n\n existed in the past and need not to be continuing in\n\n the present. The words “has been” without being\n\n followed by participle of the verb is the present\n\n perfect tense of “to be” and cannot be the present\n\n perfect continuous tense.5 Further, a reading of the\n\n Hindi version of the Constitution would show that\n\n the expression used is “pleader raha hain” and not\n\n “pleader hain”.\n\n vii. All the petitioners in the case of Deepak Aggarwal\n\n v. Keshav Kaushik and Others6, had claimed\n\n themselves to be advocates on the date of their\n\n application for the post of district judge by way of\n\n direct recruitment and thus this Court in the said\n\n case was not dealing with the issue as to whether\n\n5 Mubarak Mazdoor v. Mr. K.K. Banerji 1957 SCC Online All 196, Harbhajan Singh\n\nv. Press Council of India and Others (2002) 3 SCC 722 and Surendra Singh s/o\nRam Shanker Singh and Another v. State of U.P. through Secretary Home and\nAnother 2012 SCC Online All 37.\n6 (2013) 5 SCC 277\n\n 10\n\f being an advocate on the date of application and\n\n appointment is a necessary criterion or not. In spite\n\n of this, this Court in Deepak Aggarwal (supra)\n\n held that one of the essential requirements of \nArticle\n\n 233(2)\n is that the candidate must be continuing as\n\n an advocate on the date of application. This finding,\n\n therefore, is in the nature of an obiter dicta and not\n\n ratio decidendi.\n\n8. The gist of the arguments advanced by the learned\n\nSenior Counsel/counsel appearing for the Respondents is\n\nthat:\n\n i. For the last 60 to 65 years, the interpretation of\n\n \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution has been uniform\n\n and has stood the test of time. What was held by\n\n the two Constitution Bench judgments of this Court\n\n in the cases of Rameshwar Dayal (supra) and\n\n Chandra Mohan (supra) has been further\n\n interpreted by several three-judge bench judgments\n\n of this Court. It is given that there are two\n\n sources/streams of recruitment to the post of\n\n district judges and that direct recruitment is only\n\n 11\n\f from the stream of practicing advocates. Reliance in\n\n this respect has been placed on the judgments of\n\n this Court in the cases of Mahesh Chandra Gupta\n\n v. Union of India and Others7 and Deepak\n\n Aggarwal (supra).\n\n ii. Stare decisis et non quieta movere or to “stand by\n\n decisions and not to disturb what is settled”, is a\n\n doctrine which clearly applies to the present\n\n reference. The questions raised by serving judicial\n\n officers in the present matter are covered by over six\n\n decades of stare decisis. The directions issued by\n\n this Court in paragraphs 27 and 28 of All India\n\n Judges’ Association and Others v. Union of\n\n India and Others8, directing a quota of 75:25 for\n\n recruitment to the posts of district judges in all\n\n States, with 25% being exclusively reserved for\n\n eligible advocates, was entirely in tune with the\n\n decisions of this Court in 1960, 1965, 1985 and\n\n 1998.\n\n7 (2009) 8 SCC 273\n8 (2002) 4 SCC 247\n\n 12\n\fiii. The term “service” has been held to mean judicial\n\n service in the case of Chandra Mohan (supra). The\n\n wording of \nArticle 233(2)\n is unequivocal in\n\n distinguishing those who are already in service and\n\n placing them in a separate category. It is, therefore,\n\n evident that the said provision applies only to those\n\n who are not in judicial service either of the Union or\n\n of the State. Nowhere does it provide an eligibility\n\n condition for the appointment of in-service\n\n candidates merely because they had completed 7\n\n years of practice as an advocate prior to their\n\n appointment.\n\niv. Once an individual joins the stream of service,\n\n he/she ceases to be an advocate. A person in\n\n judicial service cannot simultaneously also be a\n\n practicing advocate and is, therefore, not eligible for\n\n being appointed as against the quota reserved for\n\n advocates. The requirement of having seven years\n\n of practice refers to a continuous state of affairs.\n\n v. Clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution does not\n\n specifically provide for direct recruitment for those\n\n 13\n\f in service. If direct recruitment is to be\n\n contemplated, this Court would be reading into the\n\n clause what is not mentioned therein. It would\n\n result in an incongruous situation, wherein, while\n\n qualifications for one source of direct recruitment\n\n (i.e., practicing advocates) are prescribed, there is\n\n no qualification for those who are in service. If direct\n\n recruitment for in-service candidates is read into\n\n clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n, it would mean that any\n\n Civil Judge (even with one day’s experience) can\n\n seek appointment as district judge by way of direct\n\n recruitment.\n\nvi. In the case of Rameshwar Dayal (supra) Harbans\n\n Singh and P.R. Sawhney (Respondents therein) did\n\n not cease to be advocates at any time after 15th\n\n August 1947 and continued to be advocates till they\n\n were appointed as judges. Further, they had a\n\n standing of seven years.\n\nvii. With respect to the two sources of recruitment,\n\n those in service are appointed in “consultation” with\n\n the High Court and those from the bar are\n\n 14\n\f appointed on the “recommendation” of the High\n\n Court. The observations relied on by the Petitioners\n\n in the lower part of paragraph 89 of Chandra\n\n Mohan (supra) are only qua the question whether\n\n the Governor can appoint from services other than\n\n judicial services. It is in that context that two\n\n sources of recruitment being “indicated” in clause\n\n (2) is mentioned. This is so because when clause (2)\n\n speaks of those who are not in service, there is\n\n obviously a second source, i.e., of those who are in\n\n service.\n\nC. ISSUE FOR CONSIDERATION\n\n9. The present batch of matters arises for consideration\n\nin view of the interpretation given to \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution of India by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in\n\nthe case of Dheeraj Mor (supra). It will be pertinent to\n\nreproduce the finding of the said three-Judge Bench, in\n\nparagraph 45, which reads thus:\n\n “45. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the\n opinion that for direct recruitment as District Judge\n as against the quota fixed for the\n advocates/pleaders, incumbent has to be practising\n advocate and must be in practice as on the cut-off\n date and at the time of appointment he must not be\n 15\n\f in judicial service or other services of the Union or\n State. For constituting experience of 7 years of\n practice as advocate, experience obtained in judicial\n service cannot be equated/combined and\n advocate/pleader should be in practice in the\n immediate past for 7 years and must be in practice\n while applying on the cut-off date fixed under the\n rules and should be in practice as an advocate on the\n date of appointment. The purpose is recruitment\n from Bar of a practising advocate having minimum 7\n years’ experience.”\n\n10. As such, what has been held by this Court, reads thus:\n\n “Under \nArticle 233 (2)\n, an advocate…\n (i) Should be in practice in the immediate\n past for seven years;\n (ii) Must be in practice while applying on the\n cut-off date; and\n (iii) Should be in practice as an advocate on\n the date of appointment.”\n\n11. We are, therefore, called upon to consider the\n\ncorrectness of the said finding.\n\nD. PROVISION OF LAW AND PRECEDENTS\n\n i. Text of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n12. \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution of India reads thus:\n\n “233. Appointment of district judges.—\n (1) Appointments of persons to be, and the posting\n and promotion of, district judges in any State shall\n be made by the Governor of the State in consultation\n with the High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation\n to such State.\n\n 16\n\f (2) A person not already in the service of the Union or\n of the State shall only be eligible to be appointed a\n district judge if he has been for not less than seven\n years an advocate or a pleader and is recommended\n by the High Court for appointment.”\n\n13. Applying the first principle of interpretation i.e., the\n\nrule of literal interpretation, we propose to analyse the\n\nprovisions contained in \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution.\n\n14. Clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution deals with\n\nthe appointments of persons to be, and the posting and\n\npromotion of, district judges in any State. It can thus be seen\n\nthat \nArticle 233(1)\n of the Constitution is a provision providing\n\nfor appointments of persons as district judges in a State so\n\nalso for posting and promotions thereof. It further provides\n\nthat such appointments shall be made by the Governor of the\n\nState concerned in consultation with the High Court\n\nexercising jurisdiction in relation to such State.\n\n15. \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution deals with the\n\neligibility of the persons for appointment to the post of district\n\njudge. A plain reading of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution would reveal that for appointment of a person to\n\nthe post of district judge, two streams are provided:\n\n 17\n\f (i) a person not already in the service of the Union or\n\n of the State; and\n\n (ii) an advocate or a pleader if he has been an advocate\n\n or a pleader for not less than seven years.\n\n16. It can thus be seen that the words “a person not\n\nalready in the service of the Union or of the State” is the first\n\npart of \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution. The second part is\n\n“shall only be eligible to be appointed if he has been for not\n\nless than seven years as an advocate or a pleader”.\n\n17. The first clause of \nArticle 233\n speaks of appointment,\n\nposting and promotion of district judges in a State which shall\n\nbe made by the Government of the State in consultation with\n\nits High Court. Clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n does not restrict\n\nappointment of persons employed in the Union or the State to\n\nthe post of district judges but enables, in addition advocates\n\nor pleaders who have seven years’ practice, to be appointed as\n\ndistrict judges. The appointment or promotion and the\n\nconsequential posting has to be made under Clause (1) of\n\nArticle 233\n, while Clause (2) provides for two sources of\n\nappointment. The plain meaning coming out of the words\n\nemployed does not provide any restriction to judicial officers\n\n 18\n\ffrom direct recruitment. On the other hand, it enables a\n\njudicial officer to be appointed as a district judge by direct\n\nrecruitment even without the prescription of a period of\n\npractice.\n\n18. As already discussed hereinabove, this Court in the\n\ncase of Dheeraj Mor (supra) has held that clause (2) of \nArticle\n\n233\n of the Constitution does not provide for a qualification of\n\na person who is already in service of the Union or of the State.\n\nIt provides qualifications only insofar as an advocate or a\n\npleader is concerned. This Court, in the case of Dheeraj Mor\n\n(supra), held that for a person to be eligible to be appointed as\n\ndistrict judge it is required that he has been for not less than\n\nseven years an advocate or a pleader. The requirement of\n\nrecommendation of the High Court is common to both streams\n\ni.e., in-service candidates and an advocate or a pleader. With\n\nthis analysis, we propose to deal with the judgments of this\n\nCourt which are concerned with the issues raised in the\n\npresent reference.\n\n 19\n\f ii. Case Laws\n a. Rameshwar Dayal v. The State of Punjab and\n Others\n\n19. The issue with regard to interpretation of \nArticle 233\n of\n\nthe Constitution came up for consideration before a\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court in the case of Rameshwar\n\nDayal (supra).\n\n20. In the said case, a petition came to be filed before the\n\nHigh Court of Punjab contending that five persons\n\n(Respondents No. 2 to 6 therein) were not qualified to be\n\nappointed as district judges under \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution at the time they were appointed by the State\n\nGovernment. The writ petitioner before the High Court had\n\ninter-alia sought for a writ of quo-warranto thereby seeking to\n\noust them from their office and for restraining them from\n\nexercising the powers, duties and functions of the posts they\n\nwere holding. The writ petition was summarily dismissed by\n\nthe High Court on 21st September 1959. An application for a\n\ncertificate of fitness was rejected by the High Court. The writ\n\npetitioner, therefore, prayed for a special leave from this Court\n\nwhich was granted on 19th August 1960.\n\n 20\n\f21. The appointment of the three respondents was\n\nchallenged on the ground that they did not have the requisite\n\nexperience of seven years’ practice in the High Court of Punjab\n\nand that their experience before the Lahore High Court, prior\n\nto partition, could not be taken into consideration for counting\n\nthe total experience. Insofar as the other two respondents are\n\nconcerned, it was contended that, one of them was working as\n\na Chairman, Jullundur Improvement Trust and the other one\n\nwas working as a Deputy Custodian, Evacuee Property on the\n\ndate of their appointment as District & Sessions Judges and\n\nas such they were not qualified.\n\n22. This Court recorded that the contentions raised on\n\nbehalf of the appellant therein ranged over a wide field,\n\nhowever, the point for consideration is that whether clause (2)\n\nof \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution provides that a person not\n\nalready in the service of the Union or of the State shall only be\n\neligible to be appointed as a district judge if he (i) has been for\n\nnot less than seven years an advocate or a pleader and\n\n(ii) is recommended by the High Court for appointment.\n\n23. This Court further recorded the following arguments\n\nwhich were raised on behalf of the appellant therein:\n\n 21\n\f(i) That the expression “advocate or pleader” is an\n\n expression of legal import and must be given its\n\n generally accepted meaning at the time the\n\n Constitution was adopted, and that the said\n\n expression means an advocate or pleader entitled to\n\n appear and plead for another in a Court in India but\n\n does not include an advocate or pleader of a foreign\n\n Court;\n\n(ii) That the use of the present prefect tense “has been” in\n\n clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution require\n\n that the person eligible for appointment must not only\n\n have been an advocate or pleader before but must be\n\n an advocate or pleader at the time he is appointed to\n\n the office of district judge;\n\n(iii) That the period of seven years referred to in clause (2)\n\n of \nArticle 233\n must be counted as the standing of the\n\n advocate or pleader with reference to his right of\n\n practice in a court in the territory of India i.e., any\n\n right of practice in a court which was in India before\n\n the partition of the country in 1947 but which is not\n\n in India since partition, cannot be taken into\n\n 22\n\f consideration for the purpose of counting the period of\n\n seven years.\n\n24. Answering the questions that arose for consideration\n\nbefore it, the Constitution Bench observed thus:\n\n “12. ……..Article 233 is a self contained provision\n regarding the appointment of District Judges. As to a\n person who is already in the service of the Union or\n of the State, no special qualifications are laid down\n and under clause (1) the Governor can appoint such\n a person as a district judge in consultation with the\n relevant High Court. As to a person not already in\n service, a qualification is laid down in clause (2) and\n all that is required is that he should be an advocate\n or pleader of seven years' standing. ……..”\n\n25. It can thus be seen that this Court has held that \nArticle\n\n233\n of the Constitution is a self-contained provision regarding\n\nthe appointment of district judges. It has been held that for a\n\nperson who is already in the service of the Union or of the\n\nState, no special qualifications are laid down and under clause\n\n(1) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution, the Governor can appoint\n\nsuch a person as a district judge in consultation with the\n\nrelevant High Court. It has also been held that for a person\n\nnot already in service, qualifications are laid down in clause\n\n(2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution and all that is required is\n\n 23\n\fthat he/she should be an advocate or pleader of seven years’\n\nstanding.\n\n26. It is thus clear that the source of appointment for both\n\nan in-service candidate and a directly recruited candidate is\n\nprovided in clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. Clause\n\n(2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution deals with the two aspects\n\nviz., (i) qualification of an advocate or a pleader and (ii)\n\nnecessity of the recommendation by the High Court.\n\n27. Insofar as the issue with regard to counting the\n\nexperience of an advocate or a pleader in the Lahore High\n\nCourt for counting the years of service as an advocate of High\n\nCourt of Punjab is concerned, we may observe that the same\n\nis not relevant for adjudication of the present reference\n\ninasmuch as it is not an issue before us.\n\n28. This Court in that respect, however, in Rameshwar\n\nDayal (supra) made a reference to the consequences that\n\nwould follow if the interpretation canvassed on behalf of the\n\nappellant therein was to be accepted. The Court recorded that\n\nif the same is accepted, then for seven years beginning from\n\n15th August 1947, no member of the Bar of the Punjab High\n\nCourt would be eligible for appointment as a district judge.\n\n 24\n\f29. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations\n\nof this Court:\n\n “13. ……..It is perhaps necessary to add that we\n must not be understood to have decided that the\n expression ‘has been’ must always mean what\n learned counsel for the appellant says it means\n according to the strict rules of grammar. It may be\n seriously questioned if an organic Constitution must\n be so narrowly interpreted, and the learned\n Additional Solicitor-General has drawn our attention\n to other Articles of the Constitution like \nArticle 5(c)\n\n where in the context the expression has a different\n meaning. Our attention has also been drawn to the\n decision of the Allahabad High Court in Mubarak\n Mazdoor v. K.K. Banerji [AIR 1958 All 323] where a\n different meaning was given to a similar expression\n occurring in the proviso to sub-section (3) of \nSection\n 86\n of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. We\n consider it unnecessary to pursue this matter further\n because the respondents we are now considering\n continued to be advocates of the Punjab High Court\n when they were appointed as district judges and they\n had a standing of more than seven years when so\n appointed. They were clearly eligible for appointment\n under clause 2 of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution.”\n\n30. It can thus be seen that with respect to the submission\n\nadvanced on behalf of the learned counsel for the appellant\n\ntherein, the Constitution Bench of this Court observed that it\n\nis necessary to add that they must not be understood to have\n\ndecided that the expression “has been” must always mean\n\nwhat the learned counsel for the appellant says it to mean. The\n\nConstitution Bench further observed that they may be\n\n 25\n\fseriously questioned if an organic constitution must be so\n\nnarrowly interpreted. However, this Court did not find it\n\nnecessary to pursue the matter in this regard since\n\nRespondents No. 2, 4 and 5 were considered to be continuing\n\nas advocates of the Punjab High Court when they were\n\nappointed as district judges and they had a standing of more\n\nthan seven years when so appointed (which was inclusive of\n\ntheir practice as an advocate in the Lahore High Court).\n\n31. This Court in Rameshwar Dayal (supra) thereafter\n\nconsidered the cases of Respondents No. 3 and 6 whose names\n\nwere not on the roll of advocates at the time they were\n\nappointed as district judges. This Court observed thus:\n\n “14. We now turn to the other two respondents\n (Harbans Singh and P.R. Sawhney) whose names\n were not factually on the roll of Advocates at the time\n they were appointed as district judges. What is their\n position? We consider that they also fulfiled the\n requirements of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution.\n Harbans Singh was in service of the State at the time\n of his appointment, and Mr Viswanantha Sastri\n appearing for him has submitted that clause (2) of\n \nArticle 233\n did not apply. We consider that even if we\n proceed on the footing that both these persons were\n recruited from the Bar and their appointment has to\n be tested by the requirements of clause (2), we must\n hold that they fulfilled those requirements. ……….”\n\n 26\n\f32. It is thus clear that in spite of the fact that\n\nRespondents No. 3 and 6 were factually not on the roll of\n\nadvocates at the time of their appointment as district judges\n\nand they were in service of the State, they were considered\n\neligible for appointment. This Court specifically observed that\n\nHarbans Singh (Respondent No. 3) and P.R. Sawhney\n\n(Respondent No. 6) were in service of the State at the time of\n\nhis appointment.\n\n33. No doubt that the learned Senior Counsel/counsel\n\nappearing for the Respondents before us in the present batch\n\nof matters are right in contending that the Constitution Bench\n\nin Rameshwar Dayal (supra) while interpreting \nSection\n\n8(2)(a)\n of the Bar Councils Act, 1926 and Clause 6 of the High\n\nCourts (Punjab) Order, 1947 held that the concerned\n\nRespondents therein did not cease to be advocates at any time\n\nor stage after August 15, 1947 and they continued to be\n\nadvocates of the Punjab High Court till they were appointed as\n\ndistrict judges. However, the position is clear that both\n\nRespondents No. 3 and 6 therein were in service of the State\n\nat the time of their appointment. It is also not in dispute that\n\n 27\n\fon 6th May 1949, Respondent No. 6 therein had got his licence\n\nto practise as an advocate suspended.\n\n b. Chandra Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh and\n Others\n\n34. The next judgment of this Court which requires our\n\nconsideration is that of Chandra Mohan (supra). Before we\n\nproceed to consider the observations of the Constitution\n\nBench in the said case, a brief narration of the facts would be\n\nnecessary.\n\n35. In the said case, in the year 1961-62, the Registrar of\n\nthe Allahabad High Court called for applications for\n\nrecruitment to ten vacancies in the Uttar Pradesh Higher\n\nJudicial Service from Barristers, Advocates, Vakils and\n\nPleaders of more than seven years’ standing and from judicial\n\nofficers.\n\n36. It will be relevant to refer to Rule 14 of the U.P. Higher\n\nJudicial Service Rules which reads thus:\n\n “Rule 14. Direct Recruitment.—\n (1) Applications for direct recruitment to the service\n shall be called for by the High Court and shall be\n made in the prescribed form which may be obtained\n from the Registrar of the Court.\n (2) The applications by barristers, advocates, vakils\n or pleaders, should be submitted through the District\n\n 28\n\f Judge concerned, and must be accompanied by\n certificates of age, character, nationality and\n domicile, standing as a legal practitioner, and such\n other documents as may be prescribed in this behalf\n by the Court. Applications from Judicial Officers\n should be submitted in accordance with the rules\n referred to in clause 2(b) of rule 5 of these Rules. The\n District Judge or other officer through whom the\n application is submitted shall send to the Court,\n along with the application, his own estimate of the\n applicant’s character and fitness for appointment to\n the service.”\n\n37. The Selection Committee constituted under the U.P.\n\nHigher Judicial Service Rules, in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the said Rules, selected six candidates from the\n\nsaid applicants as suitable for appointment to the said service.\n\nRespondents No. 2, 3 and 4 therein were advocates and\n\nrespondents No. 5, 6 and 7 therein were “judicial officers”.\n\nTheir appointments were challenged before the High Court on\n\nthe ground that the said candidates were not the members of\n\nthe judicial service. There was difference of opinion between\n\nthe judges of the Division Bench of the High Court. As such,\n\nthe matter came to be referred to a third Judge. The third\n\nJudge agreed with the view that the recruitment from both the\n\nsources was good. As such, the writ petitions were dismissed.\n\nPursuant to the certificate given by the High Court under\n\n 29\n\f\nArticles 132(1)\n and \n133(1)(c)\n of the Constitution, the appeal\n\ncame to be filed before this Court.\n\n38. It is pertinent to note that the Constitution Bench of\n\nthis Court in Chandra Mohan (supra) observed that the\n\nexpression “judicial officers” is a euphemism for the members\n\nof the Executive department who discharge some revenue and\n\nmagisterial duties.\n\n39. Though several issues were raised for consideration\n\nbefore the Constitution Bench in the case of Chandra Mohan\n\n(supra), it would suffice to refer to the following contentions:\n\n “ …(3) The Governor has no power to appoint district\n judges from judicial officers as they are not members\n of the judicial service. (4) The exclusion of the\n members of the judicial service in the matter of direct\n recruitment offends Arts. 14 and 16 of the\n Constitution; or, alternatively, the exclusion of the\n members of the judicial service in the matter of direct\n recruitment to the post of district judges while\n permitting “judicial officers” to be so recruited\n offends the said articles…..”\n\n40. It will be relevant to specifically refer to the third point\n\nwhich has been considered by this Court in Chandra Mohan\n\n(supra), which reads thus:\n\n “The third point raised is one of far-reaching\n importance. Can the Governor, after the\n Constitution, directly appoint persons from a service\n\n 30\n\f other than the judicial service as district judges in\n consultation with the High Court? Can he appoint\n “judicial officers” as district judges? The expression\n “judicial officers” is a misleading one. It is common\n case that they belong to the executive branch of the\n Government, though they perform certain revenue\n and magisterial functions.”\n\n41. It can thus be seen that the main issue that fell for\n\nconsideration before this Court in the said case was as to\n\nwhether the judicial officers belonging to the executive branch\n\nof the Government could be appointed as district judges?\n\n42. It will also be relevant to the following observations of\n\nthis Court in the case of Chandra Mohan (supra):\n\n “Before construing the said provisions, it should be\n remembered that the fundamental rule of\n interpretation is the same whether one construes the\n provisions of the Constitution or an Act of\n Parliament, namely, that the court will have to find\n out the expressed intention from the words of the\n Constitution or the Act, as the case may be. But, “if,\n however, two constructions are possible then the\n Court must adopt that which will ensure smooth and\n harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew\n the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to\n practical inconvenience or make well established\n provisions of existing law nugatory.”\n\n43. It can thus be seen that the Constitution Bench held\n\nthat though the fundamental rule of interpretation is the same\n\nwhether one construes the provisions of the Constitution or an\n\n 31\n\fAct of Parliament, namely, that the Court will have to find out\n\nthe expressed intention from the words of the Constitution or\n\nthe Act. However, if two constructions are possible then the\n\nCourt must adopt that which will ensure smooth and\n\nharmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other\n\nwhich will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical\n\ninconvenience or make well established provisions of existing\n\nlaw nugatory.\n\n44. The Court in the said case thereafter examined the\n\nentire scheme of \nArticles 233\n to 237 of the Constitution.\n\n45. After examining the scheme, this Court observed thus:\n\n “The gist of the said provisions may be stated thus :\n Appointments of persons to be, and the posting\n and promotion of, district judges in any State\n shall be made by the Governor of the State. There\n are two sources of recruitment, namely, (i) service\n of the Union or of the State, and (ii) members of\n the Bar. The said judges from the first source are\n appointed in consultation with the High Court\n and those from the second source are appointed\n on the recommendation of the High Court. But in\n the case of appointments of persons to the judicial\n service other than as district judges, they will be\n made by the Governor of the State in accordance with\n rules framed by him in consultation with the High\n Court and the Public Service Commission. But the\n High Court has control over all the district courts and\n courts subordinate thereto, subject to certain\n prescribed limitations.”\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n 32\n\f46. It can thus be seen that this Court has held that the\n\nappointments of persons to be, and the posting and promotion\n\nof, district judges in any State shall be made by the Governor\n\nof the State. This Court further held that there are two sources\n\nof recruitment, namely, (i) service of the Union or of the State,\n\nand (ii) members of the Bar. It has been held that the said\n\njudges from the first source are appointed in consultation with\n\nthe High Court and those from the second source are\n\nappointed on the recommendation of the High Court. This\n\nCourt further held that in the case of appointments of persons\n\nto the judicial service other than as district judges, the same\n\nshall be made by the Governor of the State in accordance with\n\nrules framed by him in consultation with the High Court and\n\nthe Public Service Commission. It has been further held that\n\nthe High Court has control over all the district courts and\n\ncourts subordinate thereto, subject to certain prescribed\n\nlimitations.\n\n47. This Court held that under \nArticle 236(b)\n of the\n\nConstitution, “judicial service” has been defined to mean a\n\nservice consisting exclusively of persons intended to fill the\n\n 33\n\fpost of district judge and other civil judicial posts inferior to\n\nthe post of district judge. This Court thereafter observed thus:\n\n “If this definition, instead of appearing in \nArt. 236\n, is\n placed as a clause before \nArt. 233(2)\n, there cannot\n be any dispute that “the service” in \nArt. 233(2)\n\n can only mean the judicial service. The\n circumstance that the definition of “judicial service”\n finds a place in a subsequent Article does not\n necessarily lead to a contrary conclusion. The fact\n that in \nArt. 233(2)\n the expression “the service” is\n used whereas in Arts. 234 and 235 the expression\n “judicial service” is found is not decisive of the\n question whether the expression “the service” in\n \nArt. 233(2)\n must be something other than the\n judicial service, for, the entire chapter is dealing\n with the judicial service. The definition is\n exhaustive of the service. Two expressions in the\n definition bring out the idea that the judicial service\n consists of hierarchy of judicial officers starting from\n the lowest and ending with district judges. The\n expressions “exclusively” and “intended”\n emphasise the fact that the judicial service\n consists only of persons intended to fill up the\n posts of district judges and other civil judicial\n posts and that is the exclusive service of judicial\n officers. Having defined “judicial service” in\n exclusive terms, having provided for appointments to\n that service and having entrusted the control of the\n said service to the care of the High Court, the makers\n of the world (sic) Constitution not have conferred a\n blanket power on the Governor to appoint any person\n from any service as a district judge.”\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n48. This Court, therefore, after examining the scheme held\n\nthat having defined “judicial service” in exclusive terms and\n\nhaving provided for appointments to that service and having\n\n 34\n\fentrusted the control of the said service to the care of the High\n\nCourt, the makers of the Constitution could not have conferred\n\na blanket power on the Governor to appoint any person from\n\nany service as a district judge. Subsequently, after referring to\n\nthe observations of this Court in the case of Rameshwar\n\nDayal (supra), this Court in the case of Chandra Mohan\n\n(supra) observed thus:\n\n “This passage is nothing more than a summary of the\n relevant provisions. The question whether “the\n service” in \nArt. 233(2)\n is any service of the Union or\n of the State did not arise for consideration in that\n case nor did the Court express any opinion thereon.\n We, therefore, construe the expression “the service”\n in d. (2) (sic) of \nArt. 233\n as the judicial service.”\n\n49. It can thus be seen that the question whether “the\n\nservice” in \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution “is any service of\n\nthe Union or of the State” did not arise for consideration in\n\nRameshwar Dayal (supra). This Court, therefore, in\n\nChandra Mohan (supra) construed the expression “the\n\nservice” in clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution as the\n\njudicial service.\n\n50. This Court, in the result, held that the U.P. Higher\n\nJudicial Service Rules providing for the recruitment of district\n\n 35\n\fjudges are constitutionally void and therefore the\n\nappointments made thereunder were illegal.\n\n51. A perusal of both these Constitution Bench judgments\n\nwould reveal that this Court does not hold that in case of direct\n\nrecruitment, it is only the advocates having practice of seven\n\nyears who could be appointed. Neither does either of the\n\njudgment prohibit the judicial officers to be considered for\n\nappointment by way of direct recruitment.\n\n52. If we accept the construction as put forth by the\n\nRespondents, then the first part of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of\n\nthe Constitution i.e., “a person not already in service of the\n\nUnion or of the State” will be rendered redundant and\n\nsuperfluous.\n\n53. It is, however, more than a settled position of law that\n\nit is presumed that the legislature has inserted each and every\n\nword with an intention to give the provision an effective\n\nmeaning.\n\n54. If the Constituent Assembly desired that when the\n\nrecruitment is made directly, only the advocates having seven\n\nyears of practice would be considered for appointment, it\n\nwould not have put the words “a person not already in service\n 36\n\fof the Union or of the State” in the first part of clause (2) of\n\nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. It is, therefore, to be presumed\n\nthat the Constituent Assembly has used the said words with a\n\npurpose.\n\n55. As already discussed hereinabove, the source of\n\nappointment of district judges is clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution. Even if the selection of such a person is made\n\nthrough promotions or through the mode of direct\n\nrecruitment, the appointment will have to be made by the\n\nGovernor of the concerned State in consultation with the High\n\nCourt. At the cost of repetition, we observe that the second\n\npart of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution only enables\n\nand provides for qualifications for advocates or pleaders who\n\nare desirous of competing for the post of district judge.\n\n c. State of Assam and Another v. Kuseswar Saikia\n and Others\n\n56. Coming next to the case of State of Assam and\n\nAnother v. Kuseswar Saikia and Others9.\n\n57. In the said case, a writ petition was filed before the\n\nHigh Court of Assam by Respondents No.1 to 3 therein seeking\n\n9 (1969) 3 SCC 505\n\n 37\n\fthe issuance of a writ of quo-warranto challenging the\n\nappointment of one Upendra Nath Rajkhowa, who was the\n\nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Darrang at Tazpur. The\n\nRespondents No. 1 to 3 therein had been convicted by\n\nRajkhowa in a Sessions Trial, as a result they had challenged\n\ntheir conviction inter-alia on the ground that Rajkhowa was\n\nnot entitled to hold the post of District and Sessions Judge.\n\nThe High Court held that the “promotion” of Rajkhowa by the\n\nGovernor as Additional District Judge by notification LJJ\n\n74/66/65 dated 19th June 1967 purporting to act under\n\nArticle 233\n of the Constitution was void because he could only\n\nbe promoted by the High Court acting under \nArticle 235\n of the\n\nConstitution. As a consequence, his further appointment as\n\nDistrict Judge by the Governor was also declared by the High\n\nCourt to be void. Aggrieved, the judgment of the High Court\n\nwas challenged before this Court.\n\n58. While deciding the appeal, this Court, after referring to\n\nclause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution, observed thus:\n\n “4. …….The language seems to have given trouble to\n the High Court. The High Court holds:\n “(1) ‘appointment to be’ a District Judge is\n to be made by the Governor in\n\n 38\n\f consultation with the High Court vide\n \nArticle 233;\n and\n \n(2)\n ‘promotion’ of a District Judge and not\n promotion ‘to be a District Judge’ is also to\n be made by the Governor in consultation\n with the High Court vide Article 233.”\n The High Court gives the example of selection grade\n posts in the cadre of District Judges which according\n to it is a case of promotion of a District Judge.”\n\n59. It will also be apt to refer to the following observations\n\nof this Court in the case of Kuseswar Saikia (supra):\n\n “6. It means that appointment as well as\n promotion of persons to be District Judges is a\n matter for the Governor in consultation with the\n High Court and the expression “District Judge”\n includes an Additional District Judge and an\n Additional Sessions Judge. It must be\n remembered that District Judges may be directly\n appointed or may be promoted from the\n subordinate ranks of the judiciary. The article is\n intended to take care of both. It concerns initial\n appointment and initial promotion of persons to\n be either District Judges or any of the categories\n included in it. Further, promotion of District\n Judges is a matter of control of the High Court.\n What is said of District Judges here applies equally\n to additional District Judges and Additional Sessions\n Judges. Therefore when the Governor appointed\n Rajkhowa an Additional District Judge, it could\n either be an “appointment” or a promotion under\n \nArticle 233.\n If it was an appointment it was\n clearly a matter under \nArticle 233.\n If the\n notification be treated as “promotion” of\n Rajkhowa from the junior service to the senior\n service it was a “promotion” of a person to be a\n District Judge which expression, as shown above,\n includes an Additional District Judge. In our\n opinion, it was the latter. Thus there is no doubt\n 39\n\f that the appointment of Rajkhowa as Additional\n District Judge by the Governor was a promotion and\n was made under \nArticle 233.\n It could not be made\n under \nArticle 235\n which deals with posts subordinate\n to a District Judge including an Additional District\n Judge and an Additional Sessions Judge. The High\n Court was in error in holding that the appointment\n of Rajkhowa to the position of an Additional District\n Judge was invalid because the order was made by the\n Governor instead of the High Court. The appointment\n or promotion was perfectly valid and according to the\n Constitution.”\n [Emphasis supplied]\n\n60. It is thus clear that this Court, in unequivocal terms,\n\nheld that appointment as well as promotion of persons to be\n\nDistrict Judges is a matter for the Governor in consultation\n\nwith the High Court and the expression “District Judge”\n\nincludes an Additional District Judge and an Additional\n\nSessions Judge. This Court further observed that the District\n\nJudges may be directly appointed or may be promoted from\n\nthe subordinate ranks of the judiciary. It has been observed\n\nthat \nArticle 233(1)\n is intended to take care of both i.e., it\n\nconcerns with initial appointment as well as promotion of\n\npersons to be either District Judges or any of the categories\n\nincluded in it. This Court further held that the promotion of\n\nDistrict Judges is a matter under the control of the High Court.\n\nIt has been held that when the Governor appointed Rajkhowa\n\n 40\n\fan Additional District Judge, it could either be an\n\n“appointment” or a “promotion” under \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution. It has been held that if it was an appointment, it\n\nwas clearly a matter under \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. This\n\nCourt held that there is no doubt that the appointment of\n\nRajkhowa as Additional District Judge by the Governor was a\n\npromotion and the same was made under \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution. This Court, therefore, held that the promotion\n\ncould not be made under \nArticle 235\n which deals with posts\n\nsubordinate to a District Judge including an Additional\n\nDistrict Judge and an Additional Sessions Judge and that the\n\nHigh Court was in error in holding that the appointment of\n\nRajkhowa to the position of an Additional District Judge was\n\ninvalid because the order was made by the Governor instead\n\nof the High Court.\n\n d. A. Panduranga Rao v. State of Andhra Pradesh\n and Others\n\n61. Next is the case of A. Panduranga Rao v. State of\n\nAndhra Pradesh and Others10, where the Government of\n\nAndhra Pradesh was requested by the High Court to take\n\n10 (1975) 4 SCC 709\n\n 41\n\fnecessary steps for filling up six vacancies by notifying six\n\nposts of District & Sessions Judge, Grade-II for direct\n\nrecruitment. The State Government informed the High Court\n\nvide D.O letter dated 14th September 1972 that six vacancies\n\nwere being notified for direct recruitment and they were\n\nactually notified in the Gazette on the very same date. The\n\nadvertisement was therefore published on 1st August 1972.\n\nTotally 381 applications were received. Out of 381, 26\n\napplications were found to be not in order and were therefore\n\nrejected. The remaining 355 candidates were called by the\n\nSelection Committee of the High Court for interview. The\n\nappellant therein, A. Panduranga Rao, was one of the\n\ncandidates interviewed by the Selection Committee. After\n\ncompletion of selection procedure, the High Court made its\n\nrecommendation in order of merit and Panduranga Rao was\n\n5th out of the 6 names recommended. It, however, appears that\n\nthe recommendations were leaked and the Bar Association\n\nCity Civil Court, Hyderabad and the High Court Bar\n\nAssociation passed certain resolutions/sent certain\n\nmemoranda to the Government and made some adverse\n\ncomments against some of the persons recommended by the\n\n 42\n\fHigh Court. The State Government addressed a D.O. letter\n\ndated 24th July 1973 to the High Court expressing concern\n\nover the leakage of secret information but at the same time\n\ninvited comments from the High Court. It appears that there\n\nwas an exchange of communication and thereafter, the\n\nGovernment appointed two persons from the list of the\n\ncandidates who were interviewed by the Selection Committee\n\nexcluding the appellant therein. Several writ petitions were\n\nfiled before the High Court challenging the said appointments.\n\nA writ petition was also filed by the appellant challenging the\n\nsaid appointments so also his non-selection. The writ petition\n\nfiled by the appellant before the High Court was dismissed. In\n\nappeal, this Court, after considering the provisions of \nArticle\n\n233\n of the Constitution and the judgment in the case of\n\nChandra Mohan (supra), observed thus:\n\n “8. A candidate for direct recruitment from the Bar\n does not become eligible for appointment without the\n recommendation of the High Court. He becomes\n eligible only on such recommendation under clause\n (2) of \nArticle 233.\n The High Court in the judgment\n under appeal felt some difficulty in appreciating the\n meaning of the word “recommended”. But the literal\n meaning given in the Concise Oxford Dictionary is\n quite simple and apposite. It means “suggest as fit for\n employment”. In case of appointment from the Bar it\n\n 43\n\f is not open to the Government to choose a candidate\n for appointment until and unless his name is\n recommended by the High Court.”\n\n62. Finally, this Court allowed the appeal and set aside the\n\njudgment of the High Court. It can thus clearly be seen that\n\nthe question before the Court was as to whether the State\n\nGovernment was empowered to make appointment of a\n\ncandidate not recommended by the High Court. This Court, in\n\nunequivocal terms, held that a candidate becomes eligible for\n\nappointment only on such recommendation under clause (2)\n\nof \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. The writ petition filed by the\n\nappellant before the High Court succeeded only to the extent\n\nthat the appointment of the candidates whose names were\n\nrecommended by the High Court was quashed.\n\n63. Relying on the said observations, it is sought to be\n\nsubmitted by the learned Senior Counsel/counsel appearing\n\non behalf of the Respondents that direct recruitment is\n\nreserved for the members of the Bar.\n\n64. It is, however, to be noted that in the said case of A.\n\nPanduranga Rao (supra), the question as to whether a\n\ncandidate already in the judicial service of the Union or the\n\n 44\n\fState was eligible for being considered for appointment as a\n\ndistrict judge by way of direct recruitment did not fall for\n\nconsideration.\n\n e. Satya Narain Singh v. High Court of Judicature\n at Allahabad and Others\n\n65. A heavy reliance is also placed by the Respondents on\n\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of Satya Narain Singh\n\nv. High Court of Judicature at Allahabad and Others11\n\nrendered by a Bench of three learned Judges.\n\n66. In the said case, the appellants therein, who were\n\nmembers of the Uttar Pradesh Judicial Service, in response to\n\nan advertisement by the High Court of Allahabad, applied to\n\nbe appointed by direct recruitment to the Uttar Pradesh Higher\n\nJudicial Service. They claimed that each of them had\n\ncompleted seven years of practice at the Bar even before their\n\nappointment to the Uttar Pradesh Judicial Service and as\n\nsuch, eligible to be appointed by direct recruitment to the\n\nHigher Judicial Service. The writ petitions filed by them before\n\nthe High Court were dismissed. The Civil Appeal filed\n\nthereagainst and some of the writ petitions filed before this\n\n11 (1985) 1 SCC 225\n\n 45\n\fCourt were dismissed on 11th October 1984. However,\n\nthereafter, three writ petitions were heard by a three-Judge\n\nBench which came to be dismissed by this Court on 27th\n\nNovember 1984.\n\n67. It will be relevant to refer to the arguments advanced\n\nby both the sides, which read thus:\n\n “2. The submission of Shri Lal Narain Sinha and Shri\n K.K. Venugopal was that there was no constitutional\n inhibition against members of any Subordinate\n Judicial Service seeking to be appointed as District\n Judges by direct recruitment provided they had\n completed 7 years' practice at the bar. The\n submission of the learned counsel was that members\n of the Subordinate Judiciary, who had put in 7 years'\n practice at the bar before joining the Subordinate\n Judicial Service and who had gained experience as\n Judicial Officers by joining the Subordinate Judicial\n Service ought to be considered better fitted for\n appointment as District Judges because of the\n additional experience gained by them rather than be\n penalised for that reason. The learned counsel\n submitted that a construction of \nArticle 233\n of the\n Constitution which would render a member of the\n Subordinate Judicial Service ineligible for\n appointment to the Higher Judicial Service because\n of the additional experience gained by him as a\n Judicial Officer would be both unjust and\n paradoxical. It was also suggested that it would be\n extremely anomalous if a member of the Uttar\n Pradesh Judicial Service who on the present\n construction of \nArticle 233\n is ineligible for\n appointment as a District Judge by direct\n recruitment, is nevertheless eligible to be appointed\n as a Judge of the High Court by reason of \nArticle\n 217(2)(aa).\n On the other hand Shri Gopal\n Subramanium, learned counsel for the respondent,\n 46\n\f urged that there was a clear demarcation in the\n Constitution between two sources of recruitment\n namely: (1) those who were in the service of a State\n or Union, and (2) those who were not in such service.\n He contended that the second clause of \nArticle 233\n\n was attracted only to the second source and in\n respect of candidates from that source the further\n qualification of 7 years as an advocate or a pleader\n was made obligatory for eligibility. According to Mr\n Gopal Subramanium, a plain reading of both the\n clauses of \nArticle 233\n showed that while the second\n clause of \nArticle 233\n was applicable only to those who\n were not already in service, the first clause was\n applicable to those who were already in service. He\n urged that any other construction would lead to\n anomalous and absurd consequences such as a\n junior member of the Subordinate Judicial Service\n taking a leap, as it were, over senior members of the\n Judicial Service with long records of meritorious\n service. Both sides relied upon the decisions of this\n Court in Rameshwar Dayal v. State of Punjab [AIR\n 1961 SC 816 : (1961) 2 SCR 874 : (1961) 2 SCJ 285]\n and Chandra Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh [AIR\n 1966 SC 1987 : (1967) 1 SCR 77 : (1967) 1 LLJ 412]”\n\n68. Since a heavy reliance is placed on behalf of the\n\nRespondents on the said judgment, it will be relevant to refer\n\nto the entire reasoning as recorded in the said judgment,\n\nwhich reads thus:\n\n “3. …Two points straightway project themselves\n when the two clauses of \nArticle 233\n are read: The first\n clause deals with “appointments of persons to be,\n and the posting and promotion of, District Judges in\n any State” while the second clause is confined in its\n application to persons “not already in the service of\n the Union or of the State”. We may mention here that\n “service of the Union or of the State” has been\n\n 47\n\finterpreted by this Court to mean Judicial Service.\nAgain while the first clause makes consultation by\nthe Governor of the State with the High Court\nnecessary, the second clause requires that the High\nCourt must recommend a person for appointment as\na District Judge. It is only in respect of the persons\ncovered by the second clause that there is a\nrequirement that a person shall be eligible for\nappointment as District Judge if he has been an\nadvocate or a pleader for not less than 7 years. In\nother words, in the case of candidates who are not\nmembers of a Judicial Service they must have been\nadvocates or pleaders for not less than 7 years and\nthey have to be recommended by the High Court\nbefore they may be appointed as District Judges,\nwhile in the case of candidates who are members of\na Judicial Service the 7 years' rule has no application\nbut there has to be consultation with the High Court.\nA clear distinction is made between the two sources\nof recruitment and the dichotomy is maintained. The\ntwo streams are separate until they come together by\nappointment. Obviously the same ship cannot sail\nboth the streams simultaneously. The dichotomy is\nclearly brought out by S.K. Das, J. in Rameshwar\nDayal v. State of Punjab [AIR 1961 SC 816 : (1961) 2\nSCR 874 : (1961) 2 SCJ 285] where he observes:\n “Article 233 is a self contained provision\n regarding the appointment of District\n Judges. As to a person who is already in\n the service of the Union or of the State, no\n special qualifications are laid down and\n under clause (1) the Governor can appoint\n such a person as a district judge in\n consultation with the relevant High Court.\n As to a person not already in service, a\n qualification is laid down in clause (2) and\n all that is required is that he should be an\n advocate or pleader of seven years'\n standing.”\nAgain dealing with the cases of Harbans Singh and\nSawhney it was observed:\n\n 48\n\f “We consider that even if we proceed on\n the footing that both these persons were\n recruited from the Bar and their\n appointment has to be tested by the\n requirements of clause (2), we must hold\n that they fulfilled those requirements.”\nClearly the Court was expressing the view that it was\nin the case of recruitment from the Bar, as\ndistinguished from Judicial Service that the\nrequirements of clause (2) had to be fulfilled. We may\nalso add here earlier the Court also expressed the\nview:\n “… we do not think that clause (2) of\n \nArticle 233\n can be interpreted in the light\n of Explanations added to \nArticles 124\n and\n 217”\n4. In Chandra Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh [AIR\n1966 SC 1987 : (1967) 1 SCR 77 : (1967) 1 LLJ 412]\nSubba Rao, C.J. after referring to \nArticles 233\n, 234\n,\n235\n, 236\n and \n237\n stated:\n “The gist of the said provisions may be\n stated thus: Appointments of persons to\n be, and the posting and promotion of,\n district judges in any State shall be made\n by the Governor of the State. There are two\n sources of recruitment, namely, (i) service\n of the Union or of the\n State, and (ii) members of the Bar. The\n said judges from the first source are\n appointed in consultation with the High\n Court and those from the second source\n are appointed on the recommendation of\n the High Court. But in the case of\n appointments of persons to the judicial\n service other than as district judges, they\n will be made by the Governor of the State\n in accordance with rules framed by him in\n consultation with the High Court and the\n Public Service Commission. But the High\n Court has control over all the District\n\n 49\n\f Courts and courts subordinate thereto,\n subject to certain prescribed limitations.”\n (emphasis supplied)\nSubba Rao, C.J. then proceeded to consider whether\nthe Government could appoint as District Judges\npersons from services other than the Judicial\nService. After pointing out that \nArticle 233(1)\n was a\ndeclaration of the general power of the Governor in\nthe matter of appointment of District Judges and he\ndid not lay down the qualifications of the candidates\nto be appointed or denoted the sources from which\nthe recruitment had to be made, he proceeded to\nstate:\n “But the sources of recruitment are\n indicated in clause (2) thereof. Under\n clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n two sources are\n given, namely, (i) persons in the service of\n the Union or of the State, and (ii) advocate\n or pleader.”\n5. Posing the question whether the expression “the\nservice of the Union or of the State” meant any service\nof the Union or of the State or whether it meant the\nJudicial Service of the Union or of the State, the\nlearned Chief Justice emphatically held that the\nexpression “the service” in \nArticle 233(2)\n could only\nmean the Judicial Service. But he did not mean by\nthe above statement that persons who are already in\nthe service, on the recommendation by the High\nCourt can be appointed as District\nJudges, overlooking the claims of all other seniors in\nthe Subordinate Judiciary contrary to \nArticle 14\n and\n\nArticle 16\n of the Constitution.\n6. Thus we see that the two decisions do not support\nthe contention advanced on behalf of the petitioners\nbut, to the extent that they go, they certainly advance\nthe case of the respondents. We therefore, see no\nreason to depart from the view already taken by us\nand we accordingly dismiss the writ petitions.”\n\n 50\n\f69. With due respect, we may state that the said judgment\n\ndoes not lay down the correct position of law. The finding of\n\nthis Court in the said case that the second clause of \nArticle\n\n233\n is confined in its application to persons “not already in the\n\nservice of the Union or of the State” is, in our view, erroneous.\n\nThe finding that there is a clear distinction between the two\n\nsources of recruitment and the dichotomy is maintained, in\n\nour view, is not correct. Further, the finding that the two\n\nstreams are separate until they come together by appointment\n\nand the “same ship cannot sail both the streams\n\nsimultaneously” does not lay down the correct law.\n\n70. No doubt that this Court in Satya Narain Singh\n\n(supra) correctly held that in Rameshwar Dayal (supra), this\n\nCourt had expressed the view that it was in the case of\n\nrecruitment from the Bar, as distinguished from judicial\n\nservice, that the requirements of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution of having seven years’ practice had to be\n\nfulfilled. However, it is pertinent to note that though this Court\n\nnotices that no such qualification is provided in the case of\n\ncandidates who are members of the judicial services, it is not\n\nclear from the judgment as to whether the Court finds that\n\n 51\n\fthose who were appointed from the service in Rameshwar\n\nDayal (supra) was wrong or not. However, from the judgment\n\nin Rameshwar Dayal (supra), it is obviously clear that the\n\nCourt notices that Harbans Singh and P.R. Sawhney\n\n(Respondents therein) were appointed when they were in\n\nservice of the State.\n\n71. This Court, in Satya Narain Singh (supra), after\n\nreferring to Chandra Mohan (supra), stated that in Chandra\n\nMohan (supra), the Court observed that the expression “the\n\nservice” in \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution could only mean\n\nthe judicial service. However, it further held that this Court in\n\nChandra Mohan (supra) did not mean by the above statement\n\nthat persons who are already in the service, on the\n\nrecommendation by the High Court can be appointed as\n\ndistrict judges, overlooking the claims of all other seniors in\n\nthe Subordinate Judiciary contrary to \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n72. We find that the abovesaid observations made in Satya\n\nNarain Singh (supra) that if a person who is already in service\n\nis appointed as a district judge on the recommendation of the\n\nHigh Court, thereby overlooking the claims of all other seniors\n\n 52\n\fin the subordinate judiciary, would violate \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n\nof the Constitution is not correct. On the contrary we find that\n\nit will enable the more meritorious candidates amongst the\n\njudicial officers to compete with the advocates and only if they\n\nare found to be more meritorious, will they be selected and\n\nappointed. Not only that but \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n\nConstitution would require that an equal treatment be given to\n\nall eligible candidates. In fact, the observations which amount\n\nto creating a “quota” for advocates, having practice of seven\n\nyears, in the matter of direct recruitment for the post of district\n\njudges would violate the provisions of \nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n73. We, therefore, find that barring a person, who is\n\notherwise eligible but at the time of advertisement, is in\n\njudicial service of the Union or of the State and is prevented\n\nfrom competing with the candidates who are advocates having\n\npractice of seven years, for appointment(s) in the stream of\n\ndirect recruitment would result in denial of an equal\n\ntreatment. When the appointments are made solely on the\n\nbasis of merit, then the claim of meritorious judicial officers\n\n 53\n\fcannot be overlooked. It is only merit and merit alone that\n\nshall matter.\n\n f. Sushma Suri v. Govt. of National Capital\n Territory of Delhi and Another\n\n74. The learned Senior Counsel/counsel appearing for the\n\nRespondents also placed reliance on the case of Sushma Suri\n\nv. Govt. of National Capital Territory of Delhi and\n\nAnother12. In the said case, the appellant therein who was\n\nappointed as Assistant Government Advocate and thereafter\n\nwas promoted to the post of Additional Government Advocate\n\nin this Court, had applied, in response to the advertisement\n\nissued for recruitment to the Delhi Higher Judicial Service.\n\nWhen she was not called for the interview, she filed a writ\n\npetition before the High Court, which was dismissed. While\n\nconsidering the provision contained in \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution, this Court observed thus:\n\n “3. …Obviously, this Rule has been framed to be in\n conformity with \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution.\n \nArticle 233(1)\n thereof provides for appointments of\n persons who are already in service while \nArticle\n 233(2)\n provides that a person not already in service\n is eligible for appointment if he has been for not less\n than seven years an advocate or a pleader and is\n recommended for the purpose by the High Court.\n Referring to the expression “service” in \nArticle 233(2)\n\n12 (1999) 1\n SCC 330\n\n 54\n\f it has been held by this Court in Chandra\n Mohan v. State of U.P. [AIR 1966 SC 1987 : (1967) 1\n LLJ 412] and Satya Narain Singh v. High Court of\n Judicature at Allahabad [(1985) 1 SCC 225 : 1985\n SCC (L&S) 196 : AIR 1985 SC 308] that it means\n “judicial service”. However, it is not the contention\n either before the High Court or before us that the\n appellant is in judicial service. On the other hand the\n contention is that she has more than seven years’\n experience as an advocate and, therefore, is fully\n eligible to be appointed to the Higher Judicial Service\n and the High Court was not justified in not\n considering her case for appointment. Hence we have\n to examine the only question whether the appellant\n is an “advocate” for the purpose of \nArticle 233(2)\n of\n the Constitution and “from the Bar” as envisaged in\n Rule 7 of the Rules.”\n\n75. For the reasons that are recorded by us hereinabove,\n\nwe find that the finding in the case of Sushma Suri (supra)\n\nthat \nArticle 233(1)\n of the Constitution provides for\n\nappointments of persons who are already in service, while\n\nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution provides that a person not\n\nalready in service is eligible for appointment if he has been for\n\nnot less than seven years an advocate or a pleader and is\n\nrecommended for the purpose by the High Court, is again\n\ncontrary to the provisions of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution.\n\n76. This Court, in the said case, observed thus:\n\n “6. If a person on being enrolled as an advocate\n ceases to practise law and takes up an employment,\n such a person can by no stretch of imagination be\n termed as an advocate. However, if a person who is\n 55\n\f on the rolls of any Bar Council is engaged either by\n employment or otherwise of the Union or the State or\n any corporate body or person practises before a court\n as an advocate for and on behalf of such\n Government, corporation or authority or person, the\n question is whether such a person also answers the\n description of an advocate under the Act. That is the\n precise question arising for our consideration in this\n case.”\n\n77. It can thus be seen that this Court in the case of\n\nSushma Suri (supra) has held that if a person on being\n\nenrolled as an advocate ceases to practise law and takes up an\n\nemployment, then such a person can by no stretch of\n\nimagination be termed as an “advocate”. This Court further\n\nposed a question for its consideration that if a person who is\n\non the roll of any Bar Council is engaged either by employment\n\nor otherwise of the Union or the State or a body corporate or\n\nperson practises before a Court as an advocate for and on\n\nbehalf of such Government, corporation or authority or\n\nperson, whether such a person also answers the description of\n\nan advocate under the Act.\n\n78. To answer the said question, this Court considered the\n\nprovisions under the \nAdvocates Act, 1961\n and observed that\n\nfor the purpose of the \nAdvocates Act\n and the rules framed\n\nthereunder, the Law Officer (Public Prosecutor or Government\n 56\n\fCounsel) will continue to be an advocate. It was observed that\n\nthe intention of the relevant rules is that a candidate eligible\n\nfor appointment to Higher Judicial Service should be a person\n\nwho regularly practices before the Court or tribunal, appearing\n\nfor a client.\n\n79. This Court, in the said case, thereafter observed thus:\n\n “9. In Oma Shanker Sharma case [ CWP No. 1961 of\n 1987] the Delhi High Court approached the matter in\n too pedantic a manner losing sight of the object of\n recruitment under \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution.\n Whenever any recruitment is conducted to fill up any\n post, the area of recruitment must be as broad-based\n as the Rules permit. To restrict it to advocates who\n are not engaged in the manner stated by us earlier in\n this order is too narrow a view, for the object of\n recruitment is to get persons of necessary\n qualification, experience and knowledge of life. A\n Government Counsel may be a Public Prosecutor or\n Government Advocate or a Government Pleader. He\n too gets experience in handling various types of cases\n apart from dealing with the officers of the\n Government. Experience gained by such persons\n who fall in this description cannot be stated to be\n irrelevant nor detrimental to selection to the posts of\n the Higher Judicial Service. The expression\n “members of the Bar” in the relevant Rule would only\n mean that particular class of persons who are\n actually practising in courts of law as pleaders or\n advocates. In a very general sense an advocate is a\n person who acts or pleads for another in a court and\n if a Public Prosecutor or a Government Counsel is on\n the rolls of the Bar Council and is entitled to practise\n under the Act, he answers the description of an\n advocate.”\n\n 57\n\f80. It can thus be seen that this Court has clearly held that\n\nthe object of the recruitment under \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution should not be approached in a “pedantic\n\nmanner”. It has been observed that whenever a recruitment is\n\nconducted, the area of recruitment must be “as broad-based\n\nas the rules permit”. It has been held that the object of\n\nrecruitment is to get persons of necessary qualification,\n\nexperience and knowledge of life. This Court held that a\n\nGovernment Counsel may be a Public Prosecutor or\n\nGovernment Advocate or a Government Pleader who too gets\n\nexperience in handling various types of cases apart from\n\ndealing with the officers of the Government. It has been held\n\nthat experience gained by such persons who fall in this\n\ndescription cannot be stated to be irrelevant nor detrimental\n\nin selection to the posts of the Higher Judicial Service. This\n\nCourt observed that the expression “members of the Bar” in\n\nthe relevant rule would only mean that particular class of\n\npersons who are actually practising in courts of law as\n\npleaders or advocates. This Court held that if a Public\n\nProsecutor or a Government Counsel is on the roll of the Bar\n\nCouncil and is entitled to practise under the Act, he answers\n\n 58\n\fthe description of an advocate. This Court clearly held that an\n\nadvocate employed by the Government or a body corporate as\n\nits law officer, even on terms of payment of salary would not\n\ncease to be an advocate in terms of Rule 49 of the Bar Council\n\nof India Rules.\n\n81. It can thus be seen that the observations of this Court\n\nin Sushma Suri (supra) rather than fully supporting the\n\ncontention of the Respondents, to some extent, support the\n\ncontentions of the Petitioners. This Court in the said case has\n\nemphasized that the object of recruitment is to get persons of\n\nnecessary qualification, experience and knowledge of life. It\n\nhas been observed that the Government Advocate gets\n\nexperience in handling various types of cases apart from\n\ndealing with the officers of the Government. It has been held\n\nthat the experience gained by such persons who fall in this\n\ndescription cannot be stated to be irrelevant nor detrimental\n\nto selection to the posts of the Higher Judicial Service.\n\n g. Deepak Aggarwal v. Keshav Kaushik and\n Others\n\n82. Again, in the case of Deepak Aggarwal (supra), relied\n\nupon by the learned Senior Counsel/Counsel for the\n\n 59\n\fRespondents, the five appellants therein who were working as\n\nAssistant District Attorney, Deputy Advocate General and\n\nPublic Prosecutor, etc., were selected by direct recruitment to\n\nthe post of Additional District & Sessions Judge in the\n\nHaryana Superior Judicial Service. The High Court had\n\nquashed their appointment on the ground that they did not\n\nhave the requisite criteria to qualify for the recruitment as\n\ncontemplated in \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. This Court,\n\nafter considering the Constitution Bench judgments in the\n\ncases of Rameshwar Dayal (supra) and Chandra Mohan\n\n(supra) and other judgments dealing with the similar issue,\n\nobserved thus:\n\n “89. We do not think there is any doubt about the\n meaning of the expression “advocate or pleader” in\n \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution. This should bear\n the meaning it had in law preceding the Constitution\n and as the expression was generally understood. The\n expression “advocate or pleader” refers to legal\n practitioner and, thus, it means a person who has a\n right to act and/or plead in court on behalf of his\n client. There is no indication in the context to the\n contrary. It refers to the members of the Bar\n practising law. In other words, the expression\n “advocate or pleader” in \nArticle 233(2)\n has been used\n for a member of the Bar who conducts cases in court\n or, in other words acts and/or pleads in court on\n behalf of his client. In Sushma Suri [(1999) 1 SCC\n 330 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 208], a three-Judge Bench of\n this Court construed the expression “members of the\n Bar” to mean class of persons who were actually\n\n 60\n\f practising in courts of law as pleaders or advocates.\n A Public Prosecutor or a Government Counsel on the\n rolls of the State Bar Council and entitled to practise\n under the 1961 Act was held to be covered by the\n expression “advocate” under \nArticle 233(2).\n We\n respectfully agree.”\n\n83. It can thus be seen that the meaning given to the term\n\n“advocate or pleader” in the case of Sushma Suri (supra) has\n\nbeen affirmed by this Court in the case of Deepak Aggarwal\n\n(supra). This Court further observed thus:\n\n “99. …The factum of employment is not material but\n the key aspect is whether such employment is\n consistent with his practising as an advocate or, in\n other words, whether pursuant to such employment,\n he continues to act and/or plead in the courts. If the\n answer is yes, then despite employment he continues\n to be an advocate. On the other hand, if the answer\n is in the negative, he ceases to be an advocate.”\n\n84. It can thus be seen that this Court has reiterated the\n\nposition laid down in the case of Sushma Suri (supra) that\n\nthe factum of employment is not material but the key aspect\n\nis whether such employment is consistent with his practising\n\nas an advocate or, in other words, whether pursuant to such\n\nemployment, he continues to act and/or plead in the courts.\n\nThis Court held that despite employment he continues to be\n\nan advocate.\n\n 61\n\f85. Therefore, the question that is required to be\n\nconsidered by us is if the purpose of recruitment is to get\n\npersons of necessary qualification, experience and knowledge\n\nof life, then as to whether the judicial officer who is in judicial\n\nservice could be denied an opportunity to be recruited in the\n\nposts meant to be filled by way of direct recruitment. In that\n\nrespect, we are of the considered view that it cannot be denied\n\nthat the experience a judicial officer gets by working as a judge\n\ncan only work to the betterment of the district judiciary. The\n\nquestion that we would have to therefore consider in present\n\ncase is as to whether such experienced persons having rich\n\njudicial experience can be permitted to participate in the\n\nprocess of direct recruitment for the post of district judge.\n\n h. Vijay Kumar Mishra and Another v. High Court\n of Judicature at Patna\n\n86. In Vijay Kumar Mishra and Another v. High Court\n\nof Judicature at Patna13, a case specifically relied upon by\n\nthe learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nPetitioners, the appellants therein had appeared in the\n\nrecruitment for the Subordinate Judicial Service of Bihar as\n\n13 (2016) 9 SCC 313\n\n 62\n\fwell as District Judge Entry Level (Direct from Bar). It will be\n\nrelevant to note that in the said case the process for both the\n\nrecruitments was held simultaneously. The writ petitioners\n\nbefore the Patna High Court appeared in the preliminary and\n\nmains examination of District Judge Entry Level (Direct from\n\nBar). In the meantime, they were declared qualified for the\n\nSubordinate Judicial Service in 28th Batch and accordingly\n\njoined the Subordinate Judicial Service of the State of Bihar\n\nin August 2015. Subsequently, the result of the Mains\n\nExamination of the District Judge Entry Level (Direct from\n\nBar) was published in January 2016. Both the writ petitioners\n\nwere declared qualified in the Mains Examination. The High\n\nCourt had published schedule for interview and issued call\n\nletters to both of them. One of the conditions mentioned\n\ntherein was furnishing of a ‘No Objection Certificate of the\n\nEmployer’. Therefore, the writ petitioners filed a representation\n\nbefore the Registrar General, Patna High Court seeking to\n\nappear in the said interview. The request was declined on the\n\nground that they were already in the State Judicial\n\nSubordinate Service. It was further informed to the writ\n\npetitioners that if they desire to appear in the interview, they\n\n 63\n\fmay choose to resign before participating in the interview and\n\nthat the said resignation, once tendered, would not be\n\npermitted to be withdrawn. The rejection of their\n\nrepresentation was the subject matter of a challenge before the\n\nHigh Court. The High Court rejected the writ application.\n\nHence, the writ petitioners came before this Court.\n\n87. It will be gainful to refer to the following observations\n\nin the judgment delivered by Jasti Chelameshwar, J.:\n\n “5. For any youngster, the choice must appear very\n cruel, to give up the existing employment for the\n uncertain possibility of securing a better\n employment. If the appellant accepted the advice of\n the High Court but eventually failed to get selected\n and appointed as a District Judge, he might have to\n regret his choice for the rest of his life. Unless\n providence comes to the help of the appellant to\n secure better employment elsewhere or become a\n successful lawyer, if he chooses to practise\n thereafter, the choice is bound to ruin the appellant.\n The High Court we are sure did not intend any such\n unwholesome consequences. The advice emanated\n from the High Court's understanding of the purport\n of \nArticle 233(2).\n Our assay is whether the High\n Court's understanding is right.\n 6. \nArticle 233(1)\n stipulates that appointment of\n District Judges be made by the Governor of the State\n in consultation with the High Court exercising\n jurisdiction in relation to such State. However,\n \nArticle 233(2)\n declares that only a person not already\n in the service of either the Union or of the State shall\n be eligible to be appointed as District Judge. The said\n Article is couched in negative language creating a bar\n for the appointment of certain class of persons\n\n 64\n\f described therein. It does not prescribe any\n qualification. It only prescribes a disqualification.”\n\n88. It can thus be seen that this Court once again went on\n\nto interpret \nArticle 233(2)\n to mean that only a person not\n\nalready in the service of either the Union or the State shall be\n\neligible to be appointed as District Judge. The Court observed\n\nthat the said Article is couched in “negative language” creating\n\na bar for the appointment of certain class of persons described\n\ntherein. It was further observed that it does not prescribe any\n\nqualification but only prescribes disqualification. With due\n\nrespect, we may observe that the said observations of this\n\nCourt are contrary to the law laid down by this Court in the\n\nConstitution Bench judgment of Chandra Mohan (supra).\n\n89. The Court in the case of Vijay Kumar Mishra (supra)\n\ngoes on the premise that there is a distinction between\n\nselection and appointment. It was held by this Court that every\n\nperson who is successful in the selection process undertaken\n\nby the State for the purpose of filling up of certain posts under\n\nit, does not acquire any right to be appointed automatically.\n\nThis Court noted that \nArticle 233(2)\n only prohibits the\n\n 65\n\fappointment of a person who is already in the service of the\n\nUnion or the State, but not the selection of such a person.\n\n90. After referring to the judgments of this Court in the\n\ncases of Satya Narain Singh (supra) and Deepak Aggarwal\n\n(supra), the two-Judge Bench in the said case observed that\n\nthe question as to at what stage the bar comes into operation\n\nwas not an issue before the Court nor did it go into that\n\nquestion. The Court, therefore, allowed the appellants therein\n\nto participate in the selection process without insisting upon\n\ntheir resignation from their current employment. The Court\n\nfurther directed that if the appellants therein were found\n\nsuitable, it was open to them to resign from the current\n\nemployment and opt for the post of District Judge, if they so\n\ndesire.\n\n91. Abhay Manohar Sapre, J., in his separate concurring\n\njudgment in the case of Vijay Kumar Mishra (supra) observed\n\nthus:\n\n “22. This submission though looks attractive, is not\n acceptable. Neither the text of Article and nor the\n words occurring in \nArticle 233(2)\n suggest such\n interpretation. Indeed, if his argument is accepted, it\n would be against the spirit of \nArticle 233(2).\n My\n learned Brother for rejecting this argument has\n narrated the consequences, which are likely to arise\n\n 66\n\fin the event of accepting such argument and I agree\nwith what he has narrated.\n23. In my view, there lies a subtle distinction\nbetween the words “selection” and “appointment” in\nservice jurisprudence. (See Prafulla Kumar\nSwain v. Prakash Chandra Misra [Prafulla Kumar\nSwain v. Prakash Chandra Misra, 1993 Supp (3) SCC\n181 : 1993 SCC (L&S) 960 : (1993) 25 ATC 242] .)\nWhen the Framers of the Constitution have used the\nword “appointed” in clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n for\ndetermining the eligibility of a person with reference\nto his service then it is not possible to read the word\n“selection” or “recruitment” in its place. In other\nwords, the word “appointed” cannot be read to\ninclude the word “selection”, “recruitment” or\n“recruitment process”.\n24. In my opinion, there is no bar for a person to\napply for the post of District Judge, if he otherwise,\nsatisfies the qualifications prescribed for the post\nwhile remaining in service of the Union/State. It is\nonly at the time of his appointment (if occasion so\narises) the question of his eligibility arises. Denying\nsuch person to apply for participating in selection\nprocess when he otherwise fulfils all conditions\nprescribed in the advertisement by taking recourse to\nclause (2) of \nArticle 233\n would, in my opinion,\namount to violating his right guaranteed under\n\nArticles 14\n and \n16\n of the Constitution of India.\n25. It is a settled principle of rule of interpretation\nthat one must have regard to subject and the object\nfor which the Act is enacted. To interpret a statute in\na reasonable manner, the Court must place itself in\na chair of reasonable legislator/author. So done, the\nrules of purposive construction have to be resorted to\nso that the object of the Act is fulfilled. Similarly, it is\nalso a recognised rule of interpretation of statutes\nthat expressions used therein should ordinarily be\nunderstood in the sense in which they best\nharmonise with the object of the statute and which\neffectuate the object of the legislature.\n(See Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edn., pp. 119\n\n 67\n\f and 127 by G.P. Singh). The aforesaid principle, in\n my opinion, equally applies while interpreting the\n provisions of \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution.”\n\n i. Dheeraj Mor v. High Court of Delhi\n\n92. That brings us to the decision of this Court in the case\n\nof Dheeraj Mor v. High Court of Delhi14 wherein a two-Judge\n\nBench found that in view of the various decisions of this Court,\n\nthe major issue that arises for its consideration is as to\n\nwhether the eligibility for appointment as district judge is to\n\nbe seen at the time of appointment or at the time of application\n\nor both. The matter was, therefore, directed to be placed before\n\nthe then Chief Justice of India so as to constitute a larger\n\nBench of this Court. On reference, this Court decided the\n\nmatter on 19th February 2020 in Dheeraj Mor (supra).\n\n93. The learned three-Judge Bench in the said case, upon\n\ninterpretation of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution, held that the\n\nonly mode provided for the appointment of in-service\n\ncandidates to the post of district judge was by way of\n\npromotion. According to the three learned Judges, this\n\n14 (2018) 4 SCC 619\n\n 68\n\finterpretation has already been laid down by the Constitution\n\nBench in the case of Chandra Mohan (supra).\n\n94. It will be relevant to refer to paragraph 19 of Dheeraj\n\nMor (supra) which reads thus:\n\n “19. It is apparent from the decision in Chandra\n Mohan v. State of U.P. [Chandra Mohan v. State of\n U.P., (1967) 1 SCR 77 : AIR 1966 SC 1987] that this\n Court has laid down that concerning District Judges\n recruited directly from the Bar, the Governor can\n appoint only advocates recommended by the High\n Court and Rule 14 which provided for judicial officers\n to be appointed as direct recruits was struck down\n by this Court to be ultra vires. Thus, the decision is\n squarely against the submission espoused on behalf\n of in-service candidates. In the abovementioned para\n 11 of Chandra Mohan [Chandra Mohan v. State of\n U.P., (1967) 1 SCR 77 : AIR 1966 SC 1987] , the\n position is made clear. In Chandra Mohan [Chandra\n Mohan v. State of U.P., (1967) 1 SCR 77 : AIR 1966\n SC 1987] the Court held that only advocates can be\n appointed as direct recruits, and inter alia Rule 14\n providing for executive officers' recruitment was\n struck down. This Court has held that the expression\n “service of State or Union” means judicial service, it\n only refers to the source of recruitment. Dichotomy\n of two sources of recruitment/appointment has been\n culled out in the decision.”\n\n95. It can thus be seen that the three learned Judges held\n\nthat in Chandra Mohan (supra), this Court has laid down that\n\ninsofar as district judges recruited directly from the Bar are\n\nconcerned, the Governor can appoint only advocates\n\nrecommended by the High Court and Rule 14 therein which\n\n 69\n\fprovided for the judicial officers to be appointed as direct\n\nrecruits was struck down by this Court as ultra vires. The\n\nCourt noted that the position was squarely against the\n\nsubmissions espoused on behalf of the in-service candidates.\n\nThe Court further reiterated that it was only the advocates who\n\ncould be appointed as district judges by way of direct\n\nrecruitment. The three-Judge Bench also held that the law laid\n\ndown in the case of Rameshwar Dayal (supra) was also\n\nagainst the submissions raised on behalf of the in-service\n\ncandidates.\n\n96. This Court in the said case, thereafter, referring to the\n\njudgments in Satya Narain Singh (supra), Deepak\n\nAggarwal (supra) and Vijay Kumar Mishra (supra), held that\n\nan in-service candidate cannot apply against the posts\n\nreserved for advocates/pleaders as he has to be in continuous\n\npractice in the past and at the time when he has applied and\n\nis appointed. This Court, therefore, held that the law laid down\n\nin Vijay Kumar Mishra (supra) was not correct.\n\n97. An argument was placed before this Court in Dheeraj\n\nMor (supra) with regard to denial of equal opportunity. While\n\nrejecting the said argument, the Court observed thus:\n\n 70\n\f “43.…..We find that there is no violation of equal\n opportunity. There is a wide search for talent for\n inducting in the judicial service as well as in direct\n recruitment from Bar, and the best candidates are\n identified and recruited. Persons from unusual\n places are also given the opportunity to stake their\n claim in pursuit of their choice. In State of\n Bihar v. Bal Mukund Sah [State of Bihar v. Bal\n Mukund Sah, (2000) 4 SCC 640 : 2000 SCC (L&S)\n 489] , this Court has observed that onerous duty is\n cast on the High Court under the constitutional\n scheme. It has been given a prime and paramount\n position in the matter with the necessity of choosing\n the best available talent for manning the subordinate\n judiciary. Thus, we find that there is no violation of\n any principle of the Universal Declaration of Human\n Rights, 1948 and the International Covenant on Civil\n and Political Rights and International Covenant on\n Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.”\n\n98. In conclusion, this Court observed thus:\n\n “45. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the\n opinion that for direct recruitment as District Judge\n as against the quota fixed for the\n advocates/pleaders, incumbent has to be practising\n advocate and must be in practice as on the cut-off\n date and at the time of appointment he must not be\n in judicial service or other services of the Union or\n State. For constituting experience of 7 years of\n practice as advocate, experience obtained in judicial\n service cannot be equated/combined and\n advocate/pleader should be in practice in the\n immediate past for 7 years and must be in practice\n while applying on the cut-off date fixed under the\n rules and should be in practice as an advocate on the\n date of appointment. The purpose is recruitment\n from Bar of a practising advocate having minimum 7\n years' experience.\n 46. In view of the aforesaid interpretation of \nArticle\n 233\n, we find that rules debarring judicial officers\n\n 71\n\f from staking their claim as against the posts reserved\n for direct recruitment from Bar are not ultra vires as\n rules are subservient to the provisions of the\n Constitution.”\n\n99. The answers to the reference in the main judgment of\n\nArun Mishra, J. is as under:\n\n “47. We answer the reference as under:\n 47.1. The members in the judicial service of the State\n can be appointed as District Judges by way of\n promotion or limited competitive examination.\n 47.2. The Governor of a State is the authority for the\n purpose of appointment, promotion, posting and\n transfer, the eligibility is governed by the Rules\n framed under \nArticles 234\n and \n235.\n\n 47.3. Under \nArticle 232(2) (sic)\n, an Advocate or a\n pleader with 7 years of practice can be appointed as\n District Judge by way of direct recruitment in case\n he is not already in the judicial service of the Union\n or a State.\n 47.4. For the purpose of \nArticle 233(2)\n, an Advocate\n has to be continuing in practice for not less than 7\n years as on the cut-off date and at the time of\n appointment as District Judge. Members of judicial\n service having 7 years' experience of practice before\n they have joined the service or having combined\n experience of 7 years as lawyer and member of\n judiciary, are not eligible to apply for direct\n recruitment as a District Judge.\n 47.5. The rules framed by the High Court prohibiting\n judicial service officers from staking claim to the post\n of District Judge against the posts reserved for\n Advocates by way of direct recruitment, cannot be\n said to be ultra vires and are in conformity with\n \nArticles 14\n, 16\n and \n233\n of the Constitution of India.\n 47.6. The decision in Vijay Kumar Mishra [Vijay\n Kumar Mishra v. High Court of Patna, (2016) 9 SCC\n\n 72\n\f 313 : (2016) 2 SCC (L&S) 606] providing eligibility, of\n judicial officer to compete as against the post of\n District Judge by way of direct recruitment, cannot\n be said to be laying down the law correctly. The same\n is hereby overruled.”\n\n100. Thereafter, in the judgment delivered by Arun Mishra,\n\nJ. for himself and Vineet Saran, J., in paragraph 48, the Court\n\nheld that wherever such in-service candidates have been\n\nappointed by way of direct recruitment against the posts\n\nreserved for Bar, they shall be discontinued and be reverted to\n\ntheir original post.\n\n101. In his separate concurring judgment, S. Ravindra\n\nBhat, J., after correctly narrating as to what was laid down by\n\nthe Constitution Bench in Rameshwar Dayal (supra),\n\ndistinguished it on the reasoning that this Court had no\n\noccasion to deal with any rules framed under Article 233/234\n\nin relation to the appointment for the post of district judge.\n\n102. Bhat, J., further correctly referred to the ratio of\n\nChandra Mohan (supra) as under:\n\n “67. Thereafter, the Court held that the expression\n “not already in the service” of the Union or any State\n meant that those holding civil posts, or members of\n civil services i.e. occupying non-judicial posts, were\n ineligible to compete for selection and appointment\n as District Judge; thus, only those in service as\n\n 73\n\f Judges, or members of judicial services could be\n considered for appointment.”\n\n103. It can thus be seen that Bhat, J., noticed that in\n\nChandra Mohan (supra), the Constitution Bench held that\n\nonly those in service as judges or members of judicial services\n\ncould be considered for appointment. However, after noticing\n\nthe same and noticing the judgments in the case of Satya\n\nNarain (supra) and Deepak Aggarwal (supra), he observed\n\nthus:\n\n “71. It is clear that what this Court had to consider\n was whether Public Prosecutors and Government\n Advocates were barred from applying for direct\n recruitments (i.e. whether they could be considered\n to have been in practice) and whether—during their\n course of their employment, as Public Prosecutors,\n etc. they could be said to have “been for not less than\n seven years” practising as advocates. The Court quite\n clearly ruled that such Public\n Prosecutors/Government Counsel (as long as they\n continued to appear as advocates before the court)\n answered the description and were therefore eligible.”\n\n104. In conclusion, Bhat, J., considered Rameshwar Dayal\n\n(supra) and Chandra Mohan (supra) in the following words:\n\n “75. It is thus evident, that Rameshwar\n Dayal [Rameshwar Dayal v. State of Punjab, (1961) 2\n SCR 874 : AIR 1961 SC 816] was mainly concerned\n with the question whether practice as a pleader or\n advocate, in pre-Partition India could be reckoned,\n for the purpose of calculating the seven-year period,\n\n 74\n\f stipulated in \nArticle 233(2).\n No doubt, there are some\n observations, with respect to appointments being\n referable to \nArticle 233(1).\n However, the important\n aspect which is to be kept in mind, is that no rules\n were discussed; the experience of the Advocates\n concerned, who were appointed as District Judges,\n was for a considerable period, in pre-Partition India,\n in the erstwhile undivided Punjab. Chandra\n Mohan [Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P., (1967) 1 SCR\n 77 : AIR 1966 SC 1987] , on the other hand is a clear\n authority—and an important judgment, on the\n aspect that those in the service of or holding posts,\n under the Union or States,—if they are not in judicial\n service—are ineligible for appointment as District\n Judges, under \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution. The\n corollary was that those holding judicial posts were\n not barred as holders of office or posts under the\n Union or the State. Significantly, this Court\n in Chandra Mohan [Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P.,\n (1967) 1 SCR 77 : AIR 1966 SC 1987] , invalidated a\n rule which rendered both officers holding executive\n positions, under the State, and those holding judicial\n posts, eligible to apply for appointment under \nArticle\n 233(2)\n….”\n\n105. Bhat J., with due respect, went wrong while holding\n\nthat Chandra Mohan (supra) invalidated Rule 14 therein,\n\nrendering both executive officers under the State and persons\n\nholding judicial posts ineligible to apply under \nArticle 233(2).\n\nIn fact, Chandra Mohan (supra) only held the rules\n\nempowering recruitment of District Judges from “judicial\n\nofficers” to be unconstitutional. “Judicial Officers” as noticed\n\nin the Rule was held in the decision itself to be misleading\n\n 75\n\fsince: “it is common case that they belong to the executive\n\nbranch of the Government, though they perform certain revenue\n\nand magisterial functions” (sic). It was held in Chandra Mohan\n\n(supra):\n\n “……. But \nArt. 233(1)\n is nothing more than a\n declaration of the general power of the Governor in\n the matter of appointment of district judges. It does\n not lay down the qualifications of the candidates to\n be appointed or denote the sources from which the\n recruitment has to be made. But the sources of\n recruitment are indicated in cl. (2) thereof. Under Cl.\n (2) of \nArt. 233\n two sources are given, namely, (i)\n persons in the service of the Union or of the State,\n and (ii) advocate or pleader………”\n\n106. The reference is answered by Bhat, J., in the following\n\nterms:\n\n “76. A close reading of \nArticle 233\n, other provisions\n of the Constitution, and the judgments discussed\n would show the following:\n 76.1. That the Governor of a State has the authority\n to make “appointments of persons to be, and the\n posting and promotion of, District Judges in any\n State [\nArticle 233(1)].\n\n 76.2. While so appointing the Governor is bound to\n consult the High Court [\nArticle 233(1) :\n Chandra\n Mohan [Chandra Mohan v. State of U.P., (1967) 1 SCR\n 77 : AIR 1966 SC 1987] and Chandramouleshwar\n Prasad v. High Court of Patna [Chandramouleshwar\n Prasad v. High Court of Patna, (1969) 3 SCC 56 :\n (1970) 2 SCR 666.\n\n 76\n\f76.3. \nArticle 233(1)\n cannot be construed as a source\nof appointment; it merely delineates as to who is the\nappointing authority.\n76.4. In matters relating to initial posting, initial\nappointment, and promotion of District Judges, the\nGovernor has the authority to issue the order;\nthereafter it is up to the High Court, by virtue of\n\nArticle 235\n, to exercise control and superintendence\nover the conditions of service of such District Judges.\n(See State of Assam v. Ranga Mohd. [State of\nAssam v. Ranga Mohd., (1967) 1 SCR 454 : AIR 1967\nSC 903] ,\n76.5. \nArticle 233(2)\n is concerned only\nwith eligibility of those who can be considered for\nappointment as District Judge. The Constitution\nclearly states that one who has been for not less than\nseven years, “an advocate or pleader” and one who is\n“not already in the service of the Union or of the State”\n(in the sense that such person is not a holder of a\ncivil or executive post, under the Union or of a State)\ncan be considered for appointment, as a District\nJudge. Significantly, the eligibility—for both\ncategories, is couched in negative terms. Clearly, all\nthat the Constitution envisioned was that an\nadvocate with not less than seven years' practice\ncould be appointed as a District Judge, under \nArticle\n233(2).\n\n76.6. Significantly, \nArticle 233(2)\n ex facie does not\nexclude judicial officers from consideration for\nappointment to the post of District Judge. It,\nhowever, equally does not spell out any criteria for\nsuch category of candidates. This does not mean\nhowever, that if they or any of them, had seven years'\npractice in the past, can be considered eligible,\nbecause no one amongst them can be said to answer\nthe description of a candidate who “has been for not\nless than seven years” “an advocate or a pleader” (per\nDeepak Agarwal i.e. that the applicant/candidate\nshould be an advocate fulfilling the condition of\npractice on the date of the eligibility condition, or\napplying for the post). The sequitur clearly is that a\n\n 77\n\f judicial officer is not one who has been for not less\n than seven years, an advocate or pleader.”\n\n107. While rejecting the argument with regard to denial of\n\nequal opportunity to the in-service candidates, Bhat J.,\n\nobserved thus:\n\n “82. In the opinion of this Court, there is an inherent\n flaw in the argument of the petitioners. The\n classification or distinction made—between\n advocates and judicial officers, per se is a\n constitutionally sanctioned one. This is clear from a\n plain reading of \nArticle 233\n itself. Firstly, \nArticle\n 233(1)\n talks of both appointments and promotions.\n Secondly, the classification is evident from the\n description of the two categories in \nArticle 233(2) :\n\n one “not already in the service of the Union or of the\n State” and the other “if he has been for not less than\n seven years as an advocate or a pleader”. Both\n categories are to be “recommended by the High Court\n for appointment”. The intent here was that in both\n cases, there were clear exclusions i.e. advocates with\n less than seven years' practice (which meant,\n conversely that those with more than seven years'\n practice were eligible) and those holding civil posts\n under the State or the Union. The omission of judicial\n officers only meant that such of them, who were\n recommended for promotion, could be so appointed\n by the Governor. The conditions for their promotion\n were left exclusively to be framed by the High Courts.\n 83. In view of the above analysis, since the\n Constitution itself makes a distinction between\n advocates on the one hand, and judicial officers, on\n the other, the argument of discrimination is\n insubstantial. If one examines the scheme of\n appointment from both channels closely—as Mishra,\n J. has done—it is evident that a lion's share of posts\n are to be filled by those in the judicial service. For the\n past two decades, only a fourth (25%) of the posts in\n\n 78\n\f the cadre of District Judges (in every State) are\n earmarked for advocates; the balance 75% to be filled\n exclusively from amongst judicial officers. 50%, (out\n of 75%) is to be filled on the basis of seniority-cum-\n merit, whereas 25% (of the 75%) is to be filled by\n departmental examination. This examination is\n confined to members of the judicial service of the\n State concerned. The decision of this Court in All\n India Judges' Assn. v. Union of India [All India Judges\n Assn. v. Union of India, (2010) 15 SCC 170 : (2013) 1\n SCC (L&S) 548] , reduced the limited departmental\n examination quota (out of turn promotion quota)\n from 25% to 10% which took effect from 1-1-2011.\n Thus, cumulatively, even today, judicial officers are\n entitled to be considered for appointment, by\n promotion, as District Judges, to the extent of 75%\n of the cadre relating to that post, in every State. It is\n therefore, held that the exclusion—by the rules, from\n consideration of judicial officers, to the post of\n District Judges, in the quota earmarked for\n Advocates with the requisite standing, or practice,\n conforms to the mandate of Articles 233-235, and the\n rules are valid.”\n\n108. Bhat, J., went to the extent of saying that if rules of\n\nany State permit judicial officers to compete against the\n\nadvocates’ quota for appointment as district judges, they are\n\nsusceptible to challenge. He observed that enabling judicial\n\nofficers to compete in the quota earmarked for advocates would\n\npotentially result in no one from the stream of advocates with\n\nseven or more years’ practice being selected. He held that this\n\nwill be contrary to the mandate of \nArticle 233(2).\n Bhat, J.,\n\ntherefore, held that Vijay Kumar Mishra (supra), to the extent\n\n 79\n\fthat it is contrary to Ashok Kumar Sharma and Others v.\n\nChander Shekhar and Another,15 as regards participation\n\nin the selection process of candidates who are members of the\n\njudicial service, for appointment to the post of district judge,\n\nfrom amongst the quota earmarked for advocates with seven\n\nyears’ practice, was wrongly decided and in the result\n\noverruled the same.\n\n j. All India Judges Association and Others v.\n Union of India and Others\n\n109. Reliance was also placed by the learned Senior\n\nCounsel/counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents on\n\nthe following observations made by three learned Judges of\n\nthis Court in the case of All India Judges Association and\n\nOthers v. Union of India and Others16.\n\n “27. Another question which falls for consideration is\n the method of recruitment to the posts in the cadre\n of Higher Judicial Service i.e. District Judges and\n Additional District Judges. At the present moment,\n there are two sources for recruitment to the Higher\n Judicial Service, namely, by promotion from amongst\n the members of the Subordinate Judicial Service and\n by direct recruitment. The subordinate judiciary is\n the foundation of the edifice of the judicial system. It\n is, therefore, imperative, like any other foundation,\n that it should become as strong as possible. The\n weight on the judicial system essentially rests on the\n\n15 (1997) 4 SCC 18\n16 (2002) 4 SCC 247\n\n 80\n\fsubordinate judiciary. While we have accepted the\nrecommendation of the Shetty Commission which\nwill result in the increase in the pay scales of the\nsubordinate judiciary, it is at the same time\nnecessary that the judicial officers, hard-working as\nthey are, become more efficient. It is imperative that\nthey keep abreast of knowledge of law and the latest\npronouncements, and it is for this reason that the\nShetty Commission has recommended the\nestablishment of a Judicial Academy, which is very\nnecessary. At the same time, we are of the opinion\nthat there has to be certain minimum standard,\nobjectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the\nHigher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges\nand District Judges. While we agree with the Shetty\nCommission that the recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service i.e. the District Judge cadre from\namongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the\nprocess of recruitment is to be by a competitive\nexamination, both written and viva voce, we are of\nthe opinion that there should be an objective method\nof testing the suitability of the subordinate judicial\nofficers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service.\nFurthermore, there should also be an incentive\namongst the relatively junior and other officers to\nimprove and to compete with each other so as to excel\nand get quicker promotion. In this way, we expect\nthat the calibre of the members of the Higher Judicial\nService will further improve. In order to achieve this,\nwhile the ratio of 75 per cent appointment by\npromotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to\nthe Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are,\nhowever, of the opinion that there should be two\nmethods as far as appointment by promotion is\nconcerned : 50 per cent of the total posts in the\nHigher Judicial Service must be filled by promotion\non the basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority. For\nthis purpose, the High Courts should devise and\nevolve a test in order to ascertain and examine the\nlegal knowledge of those candidates and to assess\ntheir continued efficiency with adequate knowledge\nof case law. The remaining 25 per cent of the posts in\n\n 81\n\fthe service shall be filled by promotion strictly on the\nbasis of merit through the limited departmental\ncompetitive examination for which the qualifying\nservice as a Civil Judge (Senior Division) should be\nnot less than five years. The High Courts will have to\nframe a rule in this regard.\n28. As a result of the aforesaid, to recapitulate, we\ndirect that recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service\ni.e. the cadre of District Judges will be:\n (1)(a) 50 per cent by promotion from\n amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division)\n on the basis of principle of merit-cum-\n seniority and passing a suitability test;\n (b) 25 per cent by promotion strictly on the\n basis of merit through limited competitive\n examination of Civil Judges (Senior\n Division) having not less than five years'\n qualifying service; and\n (c) 25 per cent of the posts shall be filled by\n direct recruitment from amongst the eligible\n advocates on the basis of the written and\n viva voce test conducted by respective High\n Courts.\n (2) Appropriate rules shall be framed as\n above by the High Courts as early as\n possible.\n29. Experience has shown that there has been a\nconstant discontentment amongst the members of\nthe Higher Judicial Service in regard to their seniority\nin service. For over three decades a large number of\ncases have been instituted in order to decide the\nrelative seniority from the officers recruited from the\ntwo different sources, namely, promotees and direct\nrecruits. As a result of the decision today, there will,\nin a way, be three ways of recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service. The quota for promotion which we\nhave prescribed is 50 per cent by following the\nprinciple “merit-cum-seniority”, 25 per cent strictly\non merit by limited departmental competitive\nexamination and 25 per cent by direct recruitment.\n 82\n\fExperience has also shown that the least amount of\nlitigation in the country, where quota system in\nrecruitment exists, insofar as seniority is concerned,\nis where a roster system is followed. For example,\nthere is, as per the rules of the Central Government,\na 40-point roster which has been prescribed which\ndeals with the quotas for Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes. Hardly, if ever, there has been a\nlitigation amongst the members of the service after\ntheir recruitment as per the quotas, the seniority is\nfixed by the roster points and irrespective of the fact\nas to when a person is recruited. When roster system\nis followed, there is no question of any dispute\narising. The 40-point roster has been considered and\napproved by this Court in R.K. Sabharwal v. State of\nPunjab [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab, (1995) 2\nSCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] . One of the methods\nof avoiding any litigation and bringing about\ncertainty in this regard is by specifying quotas in\nrelation to posts and not in relation to the vacancies.\nThis is the basic principle on the basis of which the\n40-point roster works. We direct the High Courts to\nsuitably amend and promulgate seniority rules on\nthe basis of the roster principle as approved by this\nCourt in R.K. Sabharwal case [R.K.\nSabharwal v. State of Punjab, (1995) 2 SCC 745 :\n1995 SCC (L&S) 548] as early as possible. We hope\nthat as a result thereof there would be no further\ndispute in the fixation of seniority. It is obvious that\nthis system can only apply prospectively except\nwhere under the relevant rules seniority is to be\ndetermined on the basis of quota and rotational\nsystem. The existing relative seniority of the\nmembers of the Higher Judicial Service has to be\nprotected but the roster has to be evolved for the\nfuture. Appropriate rules and methods will be\nadopted by the High Courts and approved by the\nStates, wherever necessary by 31-3-2003.”\n\n 83\n\f110. In addition to the reliance placed on the judgment of\n\nthis Court in the case of All India Judges Association\n\n(supra), it is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel/counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the Respondents that understanding\n\nthe provisions of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution in the correct\n\nperspective, the First National Judicial Pay Commission under\n\nthe Chairmanship of Justice K. Jagannatha Shetty, a former\n\nJudge of this Court,17 itself recommended bringing out an\n\namendment to \nArticle 233(2)\n so as to permit in-service\n\ncandidates to compete in the posts reserved for direct\n\nrecruitment. On the contrary by also placing reliance on the\n\nShetty Commission, the correctness of the aforesaid view in\n\nDheeraj Mor (supra) is sought to be reconsidered by the\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioners.\n\n111. It is also the case of the Respondents that the\n\njudgments of the Constitution Bench of this Court in the cases\n\nof Rameshwsar Dayal (supra) and Chandra Mohan (supra)\n\nhave been correctly considered by this Court in various\n\nsubsequent decisions including in the cases of Satya Narain\n\n(supra), Deepak Aggarwal (supra) and Ashok Kumar\n\n17 Hereinafter, “Shetty Commission”.\n\n 84\n\fSharma (supra). It is further submitted that the law laid down\n\nin Dheeraj Mor (supra) only reiterates the earlier position as\n\nlaid down in various judgments of this Court. It is, therefore,\n\nsubmitted that this position is in hold for decades together and\n\nno interference would be warranted for the same.\n\nE. CONSIDERATION\n\n112. We now propose to deal with the rival submissions.\n\n i. Textual and Contextual Interpretation\n\n113. We have already referred to the principles of plain and\n\nliteral interpretation hereinabove.\n\n114. We may also gainfully refer to the following\n\nobservations of this Court in the case of Reserve Bank of\n\nIndia v. Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd.\n\nand Others18:\n\n “33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the\n context. They are the bases of interpretation. One\n may well say if the text is the texture, context is what\n gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are\n important. That interpretation is best which makes\n the textual interpretation match the contextual. A\n statute is best interpreted when we know why it was\n enacted. With this knowledge, the statute must be\n read, first as a whole and then section by section,\n clause by clause, phrase by phrase and word by\n word. If a statute is looked at, in the context of its\n enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker,\n\n18 (1987) 1 SCC 424\n\n 85\n\f provided by such context, its scheme, the sections,\n clauses, phrases and words may take colour and\n appear different than when the statute is looked at\n without the glasses provided by the context. With\n these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and\n discover what each section, each clause, each phrase\n and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit\n into the scheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute\n and no word of a statute can be construed in\n isolation. Statutes have to be construed so that every\n word has a place and everything is in its place. It is\n by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting\n of the entire Act and by reference to what preceded\n the enactment and the reasonsfor it that the Court\n construed the expression “Prize Chit”\n in Srinivasa [(1980) 4 SCC 507 : (1981) 1 SCR 801 :\n 51 Com Cas 464] and we find no reason to depart\n from the Court's construction.”\n\n115. It can thus be seen that the interpretation which\n\nmakes the textual interpretation match the contextual one has\n\nto be preferred. A statute is best interpreted when the reason\n\nand purpose for its enactment is ascertained. The statute must\n\nbe read first as a whole, and then section by section, clause by\n\nclause, phrase by phrase and word by word. It has been held\n\nthat if the statute is looked at in the context of its enactment\n\nwith the glasses of the statute-maker, provided by such\n\ncontext, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words\n\nmay take colour and appear different than when the statute is\n\nlooked at without the glasses provided by the context. With\n\n 86\n\fthese “glasses” we must look at the Act as a whole and\n\ndiscover what each section, each clause, each phrase and each\n\nword means and what it is designed to say as to fit into the\n\nscheme of the entire Act. No part of a statute and no word of a\n\nstatute can be construed in isolation.\n\n116. The law laid down by this Court in Peerless General\n\nFinance and Investment Co. Ltd. (supra) has been followed\n\nin a catena of judgments including in the Constitution Bench\n\njudgment of this Court in the case of Vivek Narayan Sharma\n\nand Others (Demonetisation Case – 5 J) v. Union of India\n\nand Others19, of which one of us (Gavai, J., as he then was)\n\nwas a member.\n\n ii. Scheme of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n\n117. In that view of the matter, we will have to examine the\n\nentire scheme of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. We will also\n\nhave to give meaning to each and every word used in the said\n\nprovision.\n\n118. As already discussed hereinabove, all provisions\n\nrelating to appointment of a person to be a district judge and\n\nthe posting and promotion thereof are contained in clause (1)\n\n19 (2023) 3 SCC 1\n\n 87\n\fof \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. Such appointments have to\n\nbe made by the Governor in consultation with the High Court\n\nexercising jurisdiction in relation to such a State. As such, the\n\ncontention as sought to be placed on behalf of the\n\nRespondents that clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n\ndeals with promotions and the only manner in which in-service\n\ncandidates could be appointed as district judges is by way of\n\npromotion and further that the appointments made under\n\nclause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution have to be\n\nrestricted only to the advocates or a pleader having seven\n\nyears’ practice in our view, is not in consonance with the\n\ntextual and contextual meaning of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n119. As already discussed hereinabove, clause (1) of \nArticle\n\n233\n of the Constitution deals with all the aspects regarding\n\nappointment to be made, promotion and posting to the post of\n\ndistrict judge. Further, as held by the Constitution Bench of\n\nthis Court in the case of Kuseswar Saikia (supra), even\n\nappointment on promotion of a subordinate judicial officer\n\nwould be traceable to clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution.\n\n 88\n\f120. Not only that but as held by this Court in the case of\n\nRameshwar Dayal (supra), clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution deals with the qualification of a person to be\n\nappointed as district judge. However, it is held by this Court\n\nin the case of Rameshwar Dayal (supra), that clause (2) of\n\nArticle 233\n does not provide a qualification for a person who is\n\nalready in service of the Union or of the State. As clarified in\n\nthe case of Chandra Mohan (supra), such a service of the\n\nUnion or the State has to be only judicial service.\n\n121. Though clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n\nbegins in a negative manner, if the interpretation as sought to\n\nbe given in the judgments of this Court in the cases of Satya\n\nNarain Singh (supra) till Dheeraj Mor (supra) is to be\n\naccepted, it will render the first part of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n\nof the Constitution redundant.\n\n122. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations\n\nof Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Union of\n\nIndia and Another v. Hansoli Devi and Others20:\n\n “9. ……Patanjali Sastri, C.J. in the case of Aswini\n Kumar Ghose v. Arabinda Bose [(1952) 2 SCC 237 :\n AIR 1952 SC 369 : 1953 SCR 1] had held that it is\n not a sound principle of construction to brush aside\n\n20 (2002) 7 SCC 273\n\n 89\n\f words in a statute as being inapposite surplusage, if\n they can have appropriate application in\n circumstances conceivably within the contemplation\n of the statute. In Quebec Railway, Light Heat & Power\n Co. Ltd. v. Vandry [AIR 1920 PC 181] it had been\n observed that the legislature is deemed not to waste\n its words or to say anything in vain and a\n construction which attributes redundancy to the\n legislature will not be accepted except for compelling\n reasons……….”\n\n123. We are of the considered view, and particularly in view\n\nof what has been held in the case of Rameshwar Dayal\n\n(supra), that clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n\ncontains provisions with regard to qualification for\n\nappointment of district judge wherein it provides that for\n\nanyone who is not already in service of the Union or of the\n\nState, such a person will be eligible to be appointed as district\n\njudge only if he has been for not less than seven years an\n\nadvocate or a pleader. However, if a person is already in\n\njudicial service of the Union or of the State, no such\n\nrequirement is provided for.\n\n124. We are also of the considered view that if clause (2) of\n\nArticle 233\n of the Constitution is not read in the aforesaid\n\nmanner, then the words “a person not already in the service of\n\nthe Union or of the State” will be rendered redundant and\n\n 90\n\fotiose. Such an interpretation of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n, in\n\nour view, would not be permissible in law.\n\n125. We are further of the considered view that if the\n\nprinciple of textual and contextual interpretation is applied to\n\nthe provisions of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution, it would\n\nrequire that the first part of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the\n\nConstitution be read as “other than a person already in the\n\nservice of the Union or of the State” or “except the person\n\nalready in the service of the Union or of the State” so as to avoid\n\nrendering the first part of clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n being\n\nrendered redundant and otiose. This interpretation of ours\n\nderives support from the judgment of this Court in the case of\n\nRameshwar Dayal (supra) wherein the Constitution Bench\n\nclearly held that clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n provides qualification\n\nfor a candidate who is an advocate whereas it does not provide\n\nqualification for an in-service candidate.\n\n126. A combined reading of clauses (1) and (2) of \nArticle 233\n\nof the Constitution would, therefore, reveal that the\n\nConstitution under clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n does not provide\n\nfor qualification for an in-service candidate for direct\n\nrecruitment.\n\n 91\n\f127. Insofar as the reliance placed on the recommendations\n\nof the Shetty Commission and the directions issued in All\n\nIndia Judges’ Association (supra) by the Respondents are\n\nconcerned, it will be relevant to note that the\n\nrecommendations were made by the Shetty Commission when\n\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of Satya Narain (supra)\n\nwas holding the field.\n\n iii. Recommendations of the Shetty Commission\n\n128. It will be relevant to refer to the following\n\nrecommendations made in the Shetty Commission’s report:\n\n “11.50 We have given our anxious consideration to\n the views and comments expressed by the\n respondents to our Questions 8.3 and 8.4.\n 11.51 The majority of the High Courts and the\n Service Associations barring a couple of them are for\n giving an opportunity to the Service judges for direct\n recruitment as District Judges. Even, some of the\n Governments are in favour of such a move. The\n reasons given in support of the proposal are that it\n would promote efficiency, improve discipline in\n judicial service and make the officers to work more\n efficiently, diligently and sincerely.\n 11.52 We are highly impressed by the reasons given\n by the High Courts of Allahabad, Bombay, Punjab &\n Haryana and All India Judges’ Association. If\n meritorious young blood should be introduced in the\n mixed cadre, there is no reason why merited serving\n judges should be excluded from consideration for\n direct recruitment. In such selection the High Court\n will have an opportunity to assess the merit of\n serving judges as against the merits of the competent\n\n 92\n\fadvocates. The Bombay High Court has rightly\nobserved that the High Court in such selection will\nhave an added advantage of assessing the service\njudges on the basis of their work and confidential\nrecords.\n11.53 We agree that if an opportunity is afforded, it\nwould make the Officers to work more efficiently,\ndiligently and sincerely.\n11.54 We do not understand why such an\nopportunity should create indiscipline, heart-burn\nand jealousy amongst the judicial officers as the\nKarnataka High Court has stated. We are equally\nunable to appreciate that it may lead to frustration\namongst the Seniors who are not selected for direct\nrecruitment as indicated by the Delhi High Court.\n11.55 It may be noted that we are not recommending\nfor accelerated promotion to Service judges. The\naccelerated promotion to a junior judge may lead to\nheart-burn and jealousy in the Service. Though we\nhave formulated a question on that aspect and\nthough some of the High Courts and Associations are\nin favour of introducing the system of accelerated\npromotion, we do not consider it desirable to have\nthat system since it is likely to lead to bitterness and\njealousy amongst the officers.\n11.56 The Commission considers that if an\nopportunity for direct recruitment is afforded to in\nservice judges, it would, to a great extent, remove the\nfrustration which is presently dogging them. Such an\nopportunity would add lustre to their career and\nenable them to outshine with their merit, hard work\nand sincerity.\n11.57 The contention urged by the directly recruited\nDistrict Judges that those who have got the\npromotional channel should be allowed to make a\nmove only through that channel does not sound to\nreason. In All India Administrative Service, there is\nno bar for any person in any service for applying,\nsubject to the age prescribed. It is a common\nexperience that many of the successful IAS and IPS\n\n 93\n\f candidates initially belonged to one or the other\n service.\n 11.58 The Commission, therefore, considers that it is\n reasonable and also necessary to provide eligibility\n for service judges for direct recruitment of District\n Judges.”\n\n129. It can thus clearly be seen that the Shetty Commission\n\nhas recorded that a majority of the High Courts and the Service\n\nAssociations were of the view that the service judges should be\n\ngiven an opportunity for direct recruitment as district judges.\n\nThe reasoning given in support of the said recommendation by\n\nthe Commission was to promote efficiency, improve discipline\n\nin judicial service and make the officers work more efficiently,\n\ndiligently and sincerely. It has been observed that if\n\nmeritorious young blood should be introduced in the mixed\n\ncadre, there is no reason as to why merited serving judges\n\nshould be excluded from consideration for direct recruitment.\n\n130. It has been further observed that, in such a selection,\n\nthe High Court will have an opportunity to assess the merit of\n\nserving judges as against the merits of the competent\n\nadvocates. The Shetty Commission also referred to the view of\n\nthe Bombay High Court wherein it was stated that the High\n\nCourt in such selection will have an added advantage of\n\n 94\n\fassessing the service judges on the basis of their work and\n\nconfidential records.\n\n131. The argument with regard to indiscipline, heartburn\n\nand jealousy amongst the judicial officers as put in by the\n\nKarnataka High Court has been specifically rejected by the\n\nShetty Commission. The Commission further found that if\n\nsuch an opportunity is provided for direct recruitment to the\n\nin-service judges, it would, to a great extent, remove the\n\nfrustration which is presently dogging them. It has been\n\nobserved that such an opportunity would add lustre to their\n\ncareer and enable them to outshine with their merit, hard work\n\nand sincerity.\n\n132. The Shetty Commission further observed that when\n\nthere is no such restriction in All India Services, there is no\n\nreason as to why the service judges should be forced to enter\n\nto judicial service only through promotional channel and not\n\nbe permitted to enter through the direct recruitment. It has\n\nbeen observed that it was common experience that many of\n\nthe successful IAS and IPS candidates initially belonged to one\n\nor the other service. The Shetty Commission, therefore,\n\nrecommended amending \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution by\n\n 95\n\finsertion of clause (3) in it. The Shetty Commission also\n\nrecommended an age limit between 35 years and 45 years for\n\nadvocates and the serving judges to apply for direct\n\nrecruitment to the post of district judge.\n\n133. It is to be noted that the recommendations for\n\namendment of the Constitution as made by the Shetty\n\nCommission are on the basis of the interpretation of clause (2)\n\nof \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution in the judgment of this Court\n\nin the case of Satya Narain Singh (supra). We have already\n\nheld that the interpretation as placed in the case of Satya\n\nNarain Singh (supra) and followed subsequently is not a\n\ncorrect interpretation.\n\n134. We are, therefore, in full agreement with those\n\nobservations made by the Shetty Commission, according to\n\nwhich in order to promote efficiency in the cadre of district\n\njudges, the young talented meritorious judicial officers should\n\nnot be denied an opportunity.\n\n iv. Experience of a Judicial Officer\n\n135. As a matter of fact, some of the observations made in\n\nthe subsequent three-Judge Bench judgments of this Court in\n\nthe cases of Sushma Suri (supra) and Deepak Aggarwal\n\n 96\n\f(supra) would support the view that we have taken. In both the\n\nsaid cases, this Court held that merely because by virtue of\n\nbeing Government Advocates, the candidates who were in\n\nemployment, their rich experience of working as a lawyer for\n\nthe Government cannot be ignored. It has further been held\n\nthat since they continue to appear for the Government either\n\non the civil side or on the criminal side, their rich experience\n\nwould benefit the judiciary.\n\n136. Rule 49 of the Bar Council of India Rules as originally\n\nframed, reads as follows:\n\n “An advocate shall not be a full-time salaried\n employee of any person, Government, firm,\n corporation or concern, so long as he continues to\n practise and shall, on taking up any such\n employment, intimate the fact to the Bar Council on\n whose roll his name appears, and shall thereupon\n cease to practise as an advocate so long as he\n continues in such employment.\n Nothing in this rule shall apply to a law officer of the\n Central Government or of a State or of any Public\n Corporation or body constituted by statute who is\n entitled to be enrolled under the rules of his State Bar\n Council made under \nSection 28(2)(d)\n read with\n \nSection 24(1)(e)\n of the Act despite his being a full-time\n salaried employee.\n Law Officer for the purpose of this Rule means a\n person who is so designated by the terms of his\n appointment and who, by the said terms, is required\n to act and/or plead in Courts on behalf of his\n employer.”\n\n 97\n\f137. As already referred to hereinabove, in Sushma Suri\n\n(supra), the question arose as to whether the word “Advocate”\n\nin \nArticle 233(2)\n includes a law officer of the Central or State\n\nGovernment, public corporation or of a body corporate, who is\n\nenrolled as an advocate under exception to Rule 49, who is\n\npracticing before Courts or Tribunal for his employer. A three-\n\nJudge Bench held positively, permitting a Public Prosecutor\n\nand Government Counsel who is on the rolls of the Bar\n\nCouncil, as entitled to practice under the Act, who would also\n\nanswer the description of an Advocate under \nArticle 233(2)\n of\n\nthe Act.\n\n138. The very same question arose in a different context in\n\nSatish Kumar Sharma v. Bar Council of H.P.21. The\n\nappellant therein was appointed as Assistant (Legal) by the\n\nHimachal Pradesh State Electricity Board, who later enrolled\n\nwith the State Bar Council at the expense of the Board. After\n\nhis appointment, the appellant therein continued in the Board\n\nas a regular employee, was given promotions with change in\n\ndesignations and was also appearing for the Board in the\n\nCourts. The certificate of enrolment issued in the year 1984\n\n21 (2001) 2 SCC 365\n\n 98\n\fwas withdrawn by the Bar Council of the State in the year\n\n1996 after due notice and opportunity of hearing. Looking at\n\nthe nature of the duties of the appellant who was a full-time\n\nsalaried employee, it was found that his work was not mainly\n\nor exclusively to act or plead in Courts and he had to attend\n\nto many more duties, which were quite substantial and\n\npredominant. The appellant therein was also found to be\n\namenable to disciplinary jurisdiction of his employer and mere\n\noccasional appearances in some Courts on behalf of the\n\nemployer could not bring the employer within the meaning of\n\n“Law Officer” under paragraph 3 of Rule 49 was the finding.\n\nThe decision in Sushma Suri (supra) was specifically noticed\n\nand distinguished on the ground that in that case the court\n\nwas concerned with the definition of the word “Advocate” as\n\nappearing in \nArticle 233(2)\n, which was held to include a law\n\nofficer of the Central or State Government who is enrolled as\n\nan advocate falling under exception to Rule 49. It was found\n\nso in paragraph 20 of Satish Kumar Sharma (supra):\n\n “20. As stated in the above para the test indicated is\n whether a person is engaged to act or plead in a court\n of law as an Advocate and not whether such person\n is engaged on terms of salary or payment by\n remuneration. The essence is as to what such Law\n Officer engaged by the Government does.”\n\n 99\n\f139. Satish Kumar Sharma, however, was found to be not\n\ncoming within the exception under Rule 49 especially when\n\nthere was no rule framed by the State Bar Council entitling\n\nlaw officers to enrol as an Advocate even if they were full time\n\nemployees. The contention that after such a long time his\n\ncertificate of enrolment could not have been cancelled was\n\nnegated on the finding that even at the threshold, he was not\n\nentitled to be enrolled under Rule 49. On the same premise an\n\nalternative contention that he may be permitted to resign and\n\nretain his enrolment from the date on which the certificate was\n\nissued was also negated. Finding no reason to maintain his\n\nseniority on the rolls of the State Bar Council, on the basis of\n\nan enrolment certificate which at its very issuance was barred,\n\nthe claim was rejected.\n\n140. We have to specifically notice that both these decisions\n\nwere taken based on Rule 49 as it existed then. The exceptions\n\nprovided by paragraphs 2 and 3 have now been removed and\n\nhave been substituted with the following:\n\n “That as Supreme Court has struck down the\n appearance by Law Officers in Court even on behalf\n of their employers the Judgment will operate in the\n case of all Law Officers. Even if they were allowed to\n appear on behalf of their employers all such Law\n Officers who are till now appearing on behalf of their\n 100\n\f employers shall not be allowed to appear as\n advocates. The State Bar Council should also ensure\n that those Law Officers who have been allowed to\n practice on behalf of their employers will cease to\n practice. It is made clear that those Law Officers who\n after joining services obtained enrolment by reason of\n the enabling provision cannot practice even on behalf\n of their employers.\n That the Bar Council of India is of the view that if the\n said Officer is a whole time employee drawing regular\n salary, he will not be entitled to be enrolled as an\n advocate. If the terms of employment show that he is\n not in full time employment he can be enrolled.”\n\n141. As of now, an employee cannot get enrolled in the rolls\n\nof the State Bar Council without giving up his employment. A\n\nlaw graduate who is enrolled as an Advocate on taking up\n\nregular employment as full time salaried employee is obliged\n\nto intimate the fact to the Bar Council in which he is enrolled\n\nand would then seize to practice as an Advocate so long as he\n\ncontinues such employment. Failure to make such intimation\n\ncan result in his name being struck off from the Rolls. Reading\n\nSections 29\n, \n30\n and \n33\n of the Advocates Act, 1961 together\n\nwith Rule 49 of the Bar Council of India Rules, an employee,\n\neven if he is in the Rolls of the State Bar Council, as long as\n\nhe remains a fully salaried employee, on intimation of the\n\nregular employment would be prohibited from carrying on\n\npractice of law as an Advocate.\n 101\n\f142. It is further to be noted that Bar Council of India Rules\n\n“Part VI – Rules Governing Advocates” came to be amended by\n\nthe Bar Council of India by incorporating Chapter III\n\n“Conditions for Right to Practice” in 2010. In the said newly\n\nadded Chapter III, Rule 5 deals with voluntarily suspension of\n\npractice as well as resumption of practice. Under this Rule, an\n\nadvocate upon joining the judicial service is expected to\n\nintimate to the concerned State Bar Council that he has joined\n\nthe judicial service as a result of which his right to practice\n\nstands voluntarily suspended. Therefore, an advocate who\n\njoins the judicial service on his resignation or retirement is\n\nentitled to resume his practice after the Enrolment Committee\n\nof the concerned State Bar Council orders the resumption of\n\nhis practice and returns the certificate to him with the\n\nnecessary endorsement.\n\n143. It is thus clear that an advocate who joins the judicial\n\nservice only suspends his right to practice and continues to be\n\non the roll of the State Bar Council.\n\n144. In the case of Rameshwar Dayal (supra), the\n\nConstitution Bench has found that Harbans Singh and P.R.\n\nSawhney, Respondents No. 3 and 6 therein, were entitled to\n\n 102\n\fbe appointed as district judges though they were in service of\n\nthe State on the date of their appointment. Though, their\n\nnames were not found on the roll of the Bar Council, it was\n\nheld by the Constitution Bench while interpreting \nSection\n\n8(2)(a)\n of the Bar Councils Act, 1926 and Clause 6 of the High\n\nCourts (Punjab) Order, 1947 that the said Respondents did not\n\ncease to be advocates at any time or stage after August 15,\n\n1947 and they were deemed to be continued as advocates of\n\nthe Punjab High Court till they were appointed as district\n\njudges.\n\n145. At the cost of repetition, we may state that as per the\n\nprovisions contained in the Bar Council of India Rules, an\n\nadvocate even upon his selection and joining as a judicial\n\nofficer, he/she continues to be on the roll of the Bar Council.\n\n146. As already discussed hereinabove, the experience the\n\njudicial officers gain while working as judges is much greater\n\nthan the one, a person gains while working as an advocate.\n\nApart from that, before commencing their work as judicial\n\nofficers, the judges are also required to undergo rigorous\n\ntraining of at least one year.\n\n 103\n\f147. When Government pleaders and Assistant Public\n\nProsecutor who were still practicing in courts were held to be\n\ncompetent to apply for direct recruitment to the post of district\n\njudge, can the judicial officers before whom they practice,\n\nconsidered to be inferior. In fact, there is an anomaly insofar\n\nas an Assistant Public Prosecutor being entitled to participate\n\nin the direct recruitment of district judges, while the judicial\n\nofficers before whom they argue case are disabled; as\n\ninterpreted in Dheeraj Mor (supra).\n\n148. We, therefore, see no reason to deny an opportunity to\n\nsuch young talented judicial officers to compete with the\n\nadvocates/pleaders having seven years’ practice in the matter\n\nof direct recruitment to the post of district judge.\n\n149. We may also gainfully refer to the case of Leela Dhar\n\nv. State of Rajasthan and Others22, where a three-Judge\n\nBench of this Court has observed thus:\n\n “4. The object of any process of selection for entry\n into a public service is to secure the best and the\n most suitable person for the job, avoiding patronage\n and favouritism. Selection based on merit, tested\n impartially and objectively, is the essential\n foundation of any useful and efficient public service.\n So, open competitive examination has come to be\n\n22 (1981) 4 SCC 159\n\n 104\n\f accepted almost universally as the gateway to public\n services….”\n\n150. It can thus be seen that the object of any process of\n\nselection for entry into a public service should be to secure the\n\nbest and the most suitable person for the job.\n\n151. The view taken in the case of Leela Dhar (supra) has\n\nbeen approved by the Constitution Bench in the case of Tej\n\nPrakash Pathak and Others v. Rajasthan High Court and\n\nOthers23. This Court, in the said case, observed thus:\n\n “49. The ultimate object of any process of selection\n for entry into a public service is to secure the best\n and the most suitable person for the job, avoiding\n patronage and favouritism. Selection based on merit,\n tested impartially and objectively, is the essential\n foundation of any useful and efficient public service.\n So, open competitive examination has come to be\n accepted almost universally as the gateway to public\n services. [Lila Dhar v. State of Rajasthan, (1981) 4\n SCC 159, para 4 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 588] It is now well\n settled that while a written examination assesses a\n candidate's knowledge and intellectual ability, an\n interview test is valuable to assess a candidate's\n overall intellectual and personal qualities.”\n\n23 (2025) 2 SCC 1\n\n 105\n\f v. Interpretation of a Constitutional Provision cannot\n be pedantic\n\n152. Insofar as the reliance placed by the Respondents on\n\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of All India Judges’\n\nAssociation and Others (supra) is concerned, wherein this\n\nCourt observed that the recruitment to the higher judicial\n\nservice from amongst the advocates should be 25% and that\n\nthe recruitment should be by way of a competitive examination\n\nincluding both written examination and viva voce, we may\n\nagain state that the said observations are in light of the view\n\ntaken by this Court in the case of Satya Narain Singh (supra)\n\nand subsequent judgments relying on Satya Narain Singh\n\n(supra).\n\n153. As observed by this Court in a catena of cases, the\n\ninterpretation of the constitutional provisions cannot be\n\npedantic. It has to be organic. A purposeful interpretation has\n\nto be adopted. If the appointment to the district judges cadre\n\nis to be made directly for the purpose of enhancing the\n\nefficiency of district judiciary, any interpretation which\n\nrestricts the competition and prohibits the otherwise\n\nmeritorious candidates from zone of consideration will have to\n\nbe eschewed. The interpretation which advances the purpose\n 106\n\fof bringing in efficiency in the district judiciary and permitting\n\na broad-based competition amongst all the eligible candidates\n\nwill have to be accepted.\n\n154. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the\n\njudgments of this Court right from Satya Narain Singh\n\n(supra) till Dheeraj Mor (supra) do not lay down a correct\n\nproposition of law.\n\n vi. Eligibility of a Judicial Officer for Direct\n Recruitment\n\n155. That leaves us with the question as to whether there\n\nshould be no qualifications at all for a member of judicial\n\nservice in the service of the State or the Union, for participating\n\nin the selection process for the post of district judge by direct\n\nrecruitment.\n\n156. As already discussed hereinabove, all matters\n\npertaining to appointment of a person to the post of a district\n\njudge, his posting and promotion are covered under clause (1)\n\nof \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. As held by the Constitution\n\nBench in Kuseswar Saikia (supra), even the appointment as\n\na district judge by promotion is covered by \nArticle 233(1)\n of the\n\nConstitution. As such, the State Governments in consultation\n\n 107\n\fwith the respective High Courts will have to frame rules\n\nproviding eligibility for in-service candidates to apply for the\n\npost of district judge which would be filled by direct\n\nrecruitment. We are in full agreement with the view taken by\n\nthis Court in the case of All India Judges’ Association\n\n(supra) that the recruitment rules in all the States will have to\n\nbe uniform as far as possible. Therefore, while maintaining the\n\nproportion of 50:25:25 for the posts of district judges as\n\nprovided by the judgment of this Court in All India Judges’\n\nAssociation (supra) which was reiterated by this Court in the\n\nrecent judgment in the case of All India Judges’ Association\n\nand Others v. Union of India and Others24, we propose to\n\nissue directions to the State Governments for framing rules in\n\nconsultation with the respective High Courts providing the\n\neligibility for candidates who are already in judicial service to\n\napply for the post of district judge to be filled through direct\n\nrecruitment process.\n\n157. In that respect, we are of the considered view that for\n\nbringing the advocates and the in-service candidates at the\n\nsame level, it will be appropriate that the rules provide that an\n\n24 2025 SCC OnLine SC 1184\n\n 108\n\fin-service candidate should be eligible for recruitment to the\n\npost of district judge directly only if he has a combined\n\nexperience of seven years as an advocate and a judicial officer.\n\nSimilarly, if an advocate is participating in the selection\n\nprocess and he was a member of judicial service in the past,\n\nthen his experience as a judicial officer also cannot be ignored.\n\nHis experience as an advocate prior to joining judicial service,\n\nhis experience as a judicial officer and his experience as an\n\nadvocate after leaving the judicial service will all have to be\n\ntaken together. Such a candidate will be eligible only if he has\n\na combined experience as an advocate and as a judicial officer\n\nfor seven years.\n\n158. We are also of the considered view that in order to make\n\navailable a level playing field for all the candidates, whether\n\nfrom in-service or advocates/pleaders, the minimum age as on\n\nthe date of application should be 35 years as recommended by\n\nthe Shetty Commission.\n\n159. Insofar as the contention regarding the heartburn\n\namongst the judicial officers in a situation where a junior gets\n\npromoted before the senior is concerned, in our view, the said\n\ncontention is without any merit. The in-service candidates,\n\n 109\n\fthough junior, will have to compete before being selected with\n\nthe advocates as also their seniors, who also will be qualified,\n\nand only meritorious candidates would be selected and\n\nappointed. If a person is meritorious and on account of merit\n\nand merit alone gets selected directly as a district judge, there\n\ncan be no question of heartburn for those who are not as\n\nmeritorious as persons selected.\n\n160. Insofar as the contention that if the in-service\n\ncandidates are permitted to participate in the recruitment\n\nprocess as direct recruit, then the advocates/pleaders would\n\nnot be in a position to get selected is concerned, the same is\n\nalso without any merit.\n\n161. In the selection process, as observed by the Shetty\n\nCommission, the selection would be on the basis of competitive\n\nexamination, including both written examination and viva\n\nvoce, and the majority of the marks would be for the written\n\nexamination. The advocates/pleaders as well as in-service\n\ncandidates would compete together and only the best/most\n\nmeritorious amongst them will be selected with no weightage\n\nbeing conferred on in-service candidates. If such a restriction\n\nis not applicable in All India Services, we see no reason to\n\n 110\n\fimport such an artificial restriction in the appointment of\n\ndistrict judges by way of direct recruitment.\n\n vii. Break in practice of a prospective candidate\n\n162. Insofar as the contention advanced by the learned\n\nSenior Counsel on behalf of some of the Petitioners that even\n\nif there is a break in the number of years of practice of a\n\ncandidate, such break should be ignored and such persons\n\nwho are having a total of seven years of practice should be\n\nconsidered eligible for appointment insofar as the direct\n\ndistrict judges is concerned, we are not inclined to accept the\n\nsaid contention.\n\n163. We say so because say if a person has practised for five\n\nyears and thereafter, he takes a break of ten years and\n\nthereafter practises for two years, there will be a disconnect\n\nwith the legal profession. We are, therefore, inclined to hold\n\nthat only such persons working either as an advocate/pleader\n\nincluding Government Pleaders and Public Prosecutors or as\n\na judicial officer who, on the date of application, have a\n\ncontinuous experience of either an advocate/pleader or a\n\njudicial officer or a combination thereof shall only be eligible\n\n 111\n\fto be considered for appointment as district judges through\n\nthe stream of direct recruitment.\n\n viii. Quota for Advocates under \nArticle 233(2)\n\n164.\n We are also not inclined to accept the contention on\n\nbehalf of the respondents that 25% quota of direct recruitment\n\nis reserved only for practising advocates. We are of the view\n\nthat if the contention in this respect is accepted, it will amount\n\nto providing a “quota” for the advocates having seven years’\n\npractice. A plain and literal reading of \nArticle 233(2)\n does not\n\ncontemplate such a situation. Therefore, the contention as\n\ncanvassed in that regard does not hold water.\n\n ix. Doctrine of stare decisis\n\n165. Before we proceed to answer the questions that are\n\nframed for our consideration, it will be necessary to consider\n\nthe submission on behalf of the Respondents that in view of\n\nthe doctrine of stare decisis, since the law laid down by this\n\nCourt in Satya Narain Singh (supra) has been followed for a\n\nperiod of over 40 years, the same should not be disturbed.\n\n166. We are, however, unable to accept the said contention.\n\nIn this respect, we may gainfully refer to a recent judgment of\n\n 112\n\fthis Court in the case of Property Owners Association and\n\nOthers v. State of Maharashtra and Others25:\n\n “107. We are not inclined to accept this submission.\n In Sita Soren v. Union of India (2024) 5 SCC 629, a\n Constitution Bench of this Court, speaking through\n one of us (DY Chandrachud, J) had occasion to\n clarify that the doctrine of stare decisis is not an\n inflexible rule of law. This Court may review its earlier\n decisions if it believes that there is an error, or the\n effect of the decision would harm the interests of the\n public or if “it is inconsistent with the legal\n philosophy of the Constitution”. In cases involving\n the interpretation of the Constitution, this Court\n would do so more readily than in other branches of\n law because not rectifying a manifest error would be\n harmful to the public interest and the polity. The\n period of time over which the case has held the field\n is not of primary consequence.”\n\n167. We are of the considered view that all the judgments\n\nright from Satya Narain Singh (supra) onwards till Dheeraj\n\nMor (supra) have incorrectly applied the law laid down by the\n\nConstitution Benches of this Court in Rameshwar Dayal\n\n(supra) and Chandra Mohan (supra). As a result, by applying\n\nthe law laid down by this line of judgments, injustice was\n\nmeted out to the members of the judicial services, thereby\n\n25 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3122\n\n 113\n\fdepriving them from participating in the selection process for\n\nthe post of district judges by way of direct recruitment.\n\n168. The interpretation placed by the judgments right from\n\nSatya Narain Singh (supra) onwards till Dheeraj Mor\n\n(supra), in our view, is totally inconsistent with the provisions\n\nof clause (2) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution. Having thus\n\nfound that the law laid down by this Court in the\n\naforementioned cases does not correctly interpret the\n\nprovisions of \nArticle 233\n, if we fail to correct the legal position,\n\nwe will be perpetuating the injustice that has been meted out\n\nfor decades.\n\n169. It is further to be noted that the judgments of this\n\nCourt in Satya Narain Singh (supra) onwards have taken an\n\nincorrect view. Even after noticing the factual position in the\n\ncase of Rameshwar Dayal (supra) that two of the persons\n\nselected and whose appointments were challenged were in-\n\nservice candidates, the judgment in Satya Narain Singh\n\n(supra) and other judgments held that the post of district judge\n\nto be filled by direct recruitment are not available to in-service\n\ncandidates and can be filled in only by the advocates having\n\nrequisite number of years of practice. Even in the case of\n 114\n\fChandra Mohan (supra), a rule that fell for consideration was\n\ndealing with the direct recruitment of district judges. The said\n\nrule provided for applications for direct recruitment to be made\n\nby Barristers, Advocates, Vakils and Pleaders of more than\n\nseven years’ standing, as well as judicial officers, who were\n\nadmittedly from the executive branch of the State. We are,\n\ntherefore, of the considered view that even after noticing these\n\naspects in the Constitution Bench judgments of this Court, the\n\nsubsequent judgments holding that filling the post of district\n\njudge by direct recruitment could be filled in only by\n\nadvocates/pleaders, are not only inconsistent with the literal\n\ninterpretation of \nArticle 233\n but also inconsistent with the\n\nfactual position as it emanated for consideration of this Court\n\nin the cases of Rameshwar Dayal (supra) and Chandra\n\nMohan (supra). We, therefore, reject the argument on stare\n\ndecisis as raised by the Respondents.\n\n170. In any case, we clarify that what we have held in this\n\njudgment will be applicable only from the date of this judgment\n\nand in no case, any selection process completed, or any\n\nappointment made prior to this judgment would be affected,\n\nexcept in cases wherein any interim order(s) were passed by\n\n 115\n\fthe High Courts or this Court. In such cases, the issue would\n\nnow be governed by the orders to be passed by the Bench\n\nhearing the matters.\n\nF. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS\n\n171. In view of the answer which we propose to give for\n\nQuestion No. 4, it may not be necessary to deal with the other\n\nquestions, however, since the questions are framed by this\n\nCourt, we propose to answer all the questions.\n\n172. In the result, we answer the questions as under:\n\n (i) Judicial Officers who have already completed seven\n\n years in Bar before they were recruited in the\n\n subordinate judicial service would be entitled for being\n\n appointed as a District Judge/Additional District\n\n Judge in the selection process for the post of District\n\n Judges in the direct recruitment process;\n\n (ii) The eligibility for appointment as a District\n\n Judge/Additional District Judge is to be seen at the\n\n time of application;\n\n (iii) Though there is no eligibility prescribed under \nArticle\n\n 233(2)\n for a person already in judicial service of the\n 116\n\f Union or of the State for being appointed as District\n\n Judge, in order to provide a level playing field, we\n\n direct that a candidate applying as an in-service\n\n candidate should have seven years’ combined\n\n experience as a Judicial Officer and an advocate;\n\n(iv) A person who has been or who is in judicial service\n\n and has a combined experience of seven years or more\n\n as an advocate or a Judicial Officer would be eligible\n\n for being considered and appointed as a District\n\n Judge/Additional District Judge under \nArticle 233\n of\n\n the Constitution;\n\n(v) In order to ensure level playing field, we further direct\n\n that the minimum age for being considered and\n\n appointed as a District Judge/Additional District\n\n Judge for both advocates and Judicial Officers would\n\n be 35 years of age as on the date of application.\n\n(vi) It is held that the view taken in the judgments of this\n\n Court right from Satya Narain Singh (supra) till\n\n Dheeraj Mor (supra), which take a view contrary to\n\n 117\n\f what has been held hereinabove do not lay down the\n\n correct proposition of law.\n\n173. The reference is answered accordingly.\n\n174. Consequently, all such rules framed by the State\n\nGovernments in consultation with the High Courts which are\n\nnot in accordance with the aforesaid answers shall stand\n\nquashed and set aside. It is directed that all the State\n\nGovernments in consultation with the High Courts shall\n\nframe/amend the rules in accordance with what has been held\n\nby us hereinabove, within a period of three months from today.\n\n175. The Registry is directed to obtain the necessary orders\n\nfrom Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India, on the administrative\n\nside, to place the matters part of the present batch before an\n\nappropriate bench for deciding the same in the light of what\n\nhas been held hereinabove.\n\n176. Before we conclude, we place on record our sincere\n\nappreciation for all the learned Senior Counsel/counsel, so\n\nalso their junior counsel, for assisting us in such meticulous\n\nmanner. Our task was made easier by the assistance rendered\n\nby them. We also place on record our appreciation for all the\n\n 118\n\flearned counsel for strictly adhering to the time-limits, as a\n\nresult of which this Court was able to complete the hearing in\n\nthe prescribed time period. We would be remiss if we do not\n\nplace on record our appreciation for the Nodal Counsel in\n\ncollating all the material in an organized manner.\n\n …………..............................CJI\n (B.R.

DEEPA AND OTHERS …RESPONDENT(S)\n\n WITH\n CONNECTED MATTERS\n\n JUDGMENT\n\nM. M. Sundresh, J.\n\n 1. I have gone through the detailed analysis made by Hon’ble the Chief\n\n Justice of India in rendering the judgment. While I am in absolute\n\n agreement with the reasoning and the ultimate conclusion arrived at,\n\n along with the directions issued therein, I would only add my views on\n\n the interpretation of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution of India, 1950\n\n (hereinafter referred to as “the Constitution”).\n\n Civil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 1 of 20\n\n \n2. We are dealing with a situation where this Court, in its subsequent\n\n decisions in \nSatya Narain Singh v. High\n Court of Judicature at\n\n \nAllahabad and Others, (1985) 1 SCC 225 and Dheeraj Mor v. High\n\n Court of Delhi, (2020) 7 SCC 401 has misconstrued the law as \nlaid\n\n down by\n the larger benches of this Court in \nRameshwar Dayal v. The\n\n State of Punjab and Others\n, 1960 SCC OnLine SC 123 and Chandra\n\n Mohan v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others, 1966 SCC OnLine SC\n\n 35.\n\n3. Chapter VI of the Constitution deals exclusively with appointment,\n\n recruitment and control qua the Subordinate Courts. It is rather\n\n significant to note that this Chapter starts from the top with the\n\n appointment of district judges, followed by recruitment of persons other\n\n than district judges to the judicial service, moves on to control over\n\n Subordinate Courts, defines the expression “district judge” and\n\n “judicial service” and thereafter ends with the application of provisions\n\n of this Chapter to certain classes of Magistrates.\n\n CHAPTER VI\n SUBORDINATE COURTS\n\nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n\n “233. Appointment of district judges.—(1) Appointments of persons to\n be, and the posting and promotion of, district judges in any State shall be\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 2 of 20\n\n\f made by the Governor of the State in consultation with the High Court\n exercising jurisdiction in relation to such State.\n\n (2) A person not already in the service of the Union or of the State shall\n only be eligible to be appointed a district judge if he has been for not less\n than seven years an advocate or a pleader and is recommended by the High\n Court for appointment.”\n\nArticle 233-A\n of the Constitution\n\n “233-A. Validation of appointments of, and judgments, etc., delivered\n by, certain district judges.—Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or\n order of any court, —\n\n (a)(i) no appointment of any person already in the judicial service of a State\n or of any person who has been for not less than seven years an advocate or\n a pleader, to be a district judge in that State, and\n\n (ii) no posting, promotion or transfer of any such person as a district judge,\n\n made at any time before the commencement of the \nConstitution (Twentieth\n Amendment) Act, 1966\n, otherwise than in accordance with the provisions\n of \narticle 233\n or \narticle 235\n shall be deemed to be illegal or void or ever to\n have become illegal or void by reason only of the fact that such\n appointment, posting, promotion or transfer was not made in accordance\n with the said provisions;\n\n (b) no jurisdiction exercised, no judgment, decree, sentence or order passed\n or made, and no other act or proceeding done or taken, before the\n commencement of the \nConstitution (Twentieth Amendment) Act, 1966\n by,\n or before, any person appointed, posted, promoted or transferred as a\n district judge in any State otherwise than in accordance with the provisions\n of \narticle 233\n or \narticle 235\n shall be deemed to be illegal or invalid or ever\n to have become illegal or invalid by reason only of the fact that such\n appointment, posting, promotion or transfer was not made in accordance\n with the said provisions.”\n\nArticle 234\n of the Constitution\n\n “234. Recruitment of persons other than district judges to the judicial\n service.—Appointments of persons other than district judges to the judicial\n service of a State shall be made by the Governor of the State in accordance\n with rules made by him in that behalf after consultation with the State\n Public Service Commission and with the High Court exercising jurisdiction\n in relation to such State.”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 3 of 20\n\nArticle 235\n of the Constitution\n\n “235. Control over subordinate courts.—The control over district courts\n and courts subordinate thereto including the posting and promotion of, and\n the grant of leave to, persons belonging to the judicial service of a State and\n holding any post inferior to the post of district judge shall be vested in the\n High Court, but nothing in this article shall be construed as taking away\n from any such person any right of appeal which he may have under the law\n regulating the conditions of his service or as authorising the High Court to\n deal with him otherwise than in accordance with the conditions of his\n service prescribed under such law.”\n\nArticle 236\n of the Constitution\n\n “236. Interpretation.—In this Chapter—\n\n (a) the expression “district judge” includes judge of a city civil court,\n additional district judge, joint district judge, assistant district judge, chief\n judge of a small cause court, chief presidency magistrate, additional chief\n presidency magistrate, sessions judge, additional sessions judge and\n assistant sessions judge;\n\n (b) the expression “judicial service” means a service consisting exclusively\n of persons intended to fill the post of district judge and other civil judicial\n posts inferior to the post of district judge.”\n\nArticle 237\n of the Constitution\n\n “237. Application of the provisions of this Chapter to certain class or\n classes of magistrates.—The Governor may by public notification direct\n that the foregoing provisions of this Chapter and any rules made thereunder\n shall with effect from such date as may be fixed by him in that behalf apply\n in relation to any class or classes of magistrates in the State as they apply\n in relation to persons appointed to the judicial service of the State subject\n to such exceptions and modifications as may be specified in the\n notification.”\n\n4. As per \nArticle 233\n and \nArticle 234\n of the Constitution, while an\n\n appointment to the post of a district judge, and to posts in the judicial\n\n service other than that of a district judge shall be made by the Governor\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 4 of 20\n\n\f of the State, the consultation is only with the High Court for the former,\n\n while it additionally extends to the State Public Service Commission\n\n for the latter. The exclusion of the State Public Service Commission in\n\n the process of appointment to the post of a district judge shows that\n\n added importance is given to the said post.\n\n5. \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution deals with two modes of appointment to\n\n the post of a district judge. Clause (1) of \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution\n\n speaks of appointments to be made to the post of a district judge. These\n\n appointments are to be made either by way of a promotion or through\n\n direct recruitment.\n\n6. The procedure for appointment, posting and promotion to the post of a\n\n district judge, qua a person in the judicial service, is one and the same\n\n with respect to the appointing authority, namely, the Governor, and the\n\n same is to be done in consultation with the High Court. Promotion is\n\n obviously meant only for a person in the judicial service. One has to be\n\n promoted first by the Governor, in consultation with the High Court,\n\n and thereafter appointed as a district judge. Therefore, promotion is a\n\n precursor to appointment as a district judge qua a person in the judicial\n\n service. Such an appointment is nothing but a resultant consequence.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 5 of 20\n\n\f To make this position clear, one has to read \nArticle 233(1)\n of the\n\n Constitution with respect to appointments as “appointments of persons\n\n to be district judges”. Similarly, for posting, it has to be read as “posting\n\n of district judges” and promotions of persons in the judicial service as\n\n “promotion and appointment as district judges.” One cannot ignore the\n\n word “persons” which would only mean persons from two modes of\n\n appointment. Therefore, \nArticle 233(1)\n of the Constitution deals with\n\n both, the modes and the sources of appointment.\n\n7. \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution is a continuation of \nArticle 233(1)\n of\n\n the Constitution. This provision, in fact, reiterates the fact that an\n\n appointment by way of direct recruitment can be done from two\n\n sources, namely, ‘judicial service’ and ‘an advocate or a pleader’. While\n\n doing so, it declares the eligibility criteria only for the latter. Hence, it\n\n is made abundantly clear that no such eligibility criteria are fixed for a\n\n person in the judicial service. Clause (1) along with Clause (2) of \nArticle\n\n 233\n of the Constitution, is a complete code by itself, and therefore does\n\n not leave any room for interpretation otherwise.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 6 of 20\n\n\fDOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWERS VIS-À-VIS\nINDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY\n\n8. Montesquieu’s words of wisdom in ‘The Spirit of Laws’ become\n\n relevant in this context:\n\n “There can be no liberty... there is no liberty if the powers of judging\n are not separated from the legislative and executive... there would be\n an end to everything if the same man or the same body... were to\n exercise those three powers.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n9. \nArticle 50\n of the Constitution forms the basis for the applicability of the\n\n doctrine of separation of powers. It deals with the separation of the\n\n judiciary from the executive, and imposes an obligation on the State to\n\n take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public\n\n services of the State.\n\nArticle 50\n of the Constitution\n\n “50. Separation of judiciary from executive.—The State shall take steps\n to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services of the\n State.”\n\n Hence, the concept of ‘independence of the judiciary’ finds both, its\n\n genesis and sustenance, in the doctrine of separation of powers.\n\n Dr. Rajendra Prasad, President of the Constituent Assembly and later\n\n President of India, in his speech to the Constituent Assembly of India,\n\n preceding the motion to adopt the Constitution, in Constituent\n\n Assembly Debates, Volume XI (debate of 26-11-1949), stated thus:\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 7 of 20\n\n\f “We have provided in the Constitution for a judiciary which will be\n independent. It is difficult to suggest anything more to make the\n Supreme Court and the High Courts independent of the influence of\n the executive. There is an attempt made in the Constitution to make\n even the lower judiciary independent of any outside or extraneous\n influence.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n It is such independence that allows each and every judge to make\n\n decisions, uninfluenced by any factor. Thus, the independence of the\n\n judiciary and the separation of powers between the three organs of the\n\n State, which form an integral part of the basic structure doctrine, ensure\n\n a vibrant and flourishing institution.\n\n10.Under \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution, the primacy given to the High\n\n Courts, insofar as the mandate for its consultation in appointments to the\n\n post of a district judge, along with the control exercised by it over\n\n Subordinate Courts under \nArticle 235\n of the Constitution, is a classic\n\n exhibition of the doctrine of separation of powers.\n\n11.Judging is an independent sovereign function. The function of the\n\n presiding officer of a Court is purely judicial, and not even quasi-\n\n judicial. For instance, in a criminal case, the prosecuting agency would\n\n invariably be either the State, the Union or their instrumentalities, who\n\n become mere litigants before the Court, though the presiding officer’s\n\n post may be connected to them only for administrative purposes. No\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 8 of 20\n\n\f employee can be an adjudicator of an employer. To say that such a judge\n\n is their employee, and therefore debarred from competing for the\n\n vacancies earmarked to be filled through direct recruitment, would be\n\n contrary to the principle of independence of the judiciary.\n\n12.In the context of the aforesaid discussion, the views of M.P. Singh in his\n\n article titled, ‘Securing the Independence of the Judiciary – The Indian\n\n Experience’ published in the Indiana International & Comparative Law\n\n Review, IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law, gain significance:\n\n “…Although the nature of the Indian Constitution-whether it is federal or\n unitary-is doubtful, basically it provides for a federal structure of\n government consisting of the Union and the States. The Union and the\n States have their distinct powers and organs of governance given in the\n constitution. While the Union and States have separate legislatures and\n executives, they do not have a separate judiciary. The judiciary has a\n single pyramidal structure with the lower or subordinate courts at the\n bottom, the High Courts in the middle, and the Supreme Court at the\n top. For funding and some administrative purposes, the subordinate\n courts are subject to regulation by the respective States, but they are\n basically under the supervision of the High Courts….The unitary\n character of the judiciary is not an accident but rather a conscious and\n deliberate act of the constitution makers for whom a single integrated\n judiciary and uniformity of law were essential for the maintenance of\n the unity of the country and of uniform standards of judicial behavior\n and independence….”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n13.Judicial service is a distinct service by itself, owing allegiance to the\n\n judiciary alone. Therefore, it is kept away from the hands of the other\n\n two organs, except to a limited extent. Any attempt to dilute such judicial\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 9 of 20\n\n\f independence, by giving a rigid interpretation, would be against the\n\n constitutional ethos. The said view gets fortified by the judgment of this\n\n Court in the case of \nState of Bihar and Another v. Bal Mukund Sah\n\n and Others\n, (2000) 4 SCC 640\n\n “32. It is true, as submitted by learned Senior Counsel, Shri Dwivedi for the\n appellant State that under \nArticle 16(4)\n the State is enabled to provide for\n reservations in services. But so far as “Judicial Service” is concerned,\n such reservation can be made by the Governor, in exercise of his rule-\n making power only after consultation with the High Court. The\n enactment of any statutory provision dehors consultation with the High\n Court for regulating the recruitment to the District Judiciary and to\n the Subordinate Judiciary will clearly fly in the face of the complete\n scheme of recruitment and appointment to the Subordinate Judiciary\n and the exclusive field earmarked in connection with such\n appointments by \nArticles 233\n and \n234.\n It is not as if that the High\n Courts being constitutional functionaries may be oblivious of the need\n for a scheme of reservation if necessary in appropriate cases by\n resorting to the enabling provision under \nArticle 16(4).\n The High\n Courts can get consulted by the Governor for framing appropriate\n rules regarding reservation for governing recruitment under \nArticles\n 233\n and \n234.\n But so long as it is not done, the Legislature cannot, by an\n indirect method, completely bypassing the High Court and exercising\n its legislative power, circumvent and cut across the very scheme of\n recruitment and appointment to the District Judiciary as envisaged by\n the makers of the Constitution. Such an exercise, apart from being\n totally forbidden by the constitutional scheme, will also fall foul on the\n concept relating to “separation of powers between the Legislature, the\n Executive and the Judiciary” as well as the fundamental concept of an\n “independent Judiciary”. Both these concepts are now elevated to the\n level of basic structure of the Constitution and are the very heart of the\n constitutional scheme.\n\n 33. \nIn the case of \nKesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala\n [(1973) 4 SCC\n 225] a twelve-Member Constitution Bench of this Court had occasion\n to consider this question regarding the basic structure of the\n Constitution which, according to the Court, could not be tinkered with\n by Parliament in exercise of its amending power under \nArticle 368\n of\n the Constitution.\n Sikri, C.J., in para 247 of the Report referred with\n approval the decision of the Judicial Committee in Liyanage case\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 10 of 20\n\n\f [Liyanage v. R., (1967) 1 AC 259 : (1966) 1 All ER 650 : (1966) 2 WLR\n 682 (PC)] for culling out the implied limitations on the amending power of\n the competent Legislature like Parliament of Ceylon with which that case\n was concerned. The relevant observations are found in SCC paras 253 to\n 255 of the Report at pp. 357 and 358, which read as under:\n\n “253. The case, however, furnishes another instance where implied\n limitations were inferred. After referring to the provisions dealing with\n ‘Judicature’ and the Judges, the Board observed:\n\n ‘These provisions manifest an intention to secure in the Judiciary a\n freedom from political, legislative and executive control. They are\n wholly appropriate in a Constitution which intends that judicial\n power shall be vested only in the Judicature. They would be\n inappropriate in a Constitution by which it was intended that judicial\n power should be shared by the Executive or the Legislature. The\n Constitution's silence as to the vesting of judicial power is consistent\n with its remaining, where it had lain for more than a century, in the\n hands of the Judicature. It is not consistent with any intention that\n henceforth it should pass to or be shared by, the Executive or the\n Legislature.’\n\n 254. The Judicial Committee was of the view that there ‘exists a\n separate power in the Judicature which under the Constitution as it\n stands cannot be usurped or infringed by the Executive or the\n Legislature’. The Judicial Committee cut down the plain words of\n \nSection 29(1)\n thus:\n\n ‘\nSection 29(1)\n of the Constitution says.—“Subject to the provisions of this\n Order Parliament shall have power to make laws for the peace, order and\n good government of the Island.” These words have habitually been\n construed in their fullest scope. \nSection 29(4)\n provides that Parliament\n may amend the Constitution on a two-thirds majority with a certificate of\n the Speaker. Their Lordships however cannot read the words of \nSection\n 29(1)\n as entitling Parliament to pass legislation which usurps the judicial\n power of the Judicature — e.g., by passing an Act of attainder against\n some person or instructing a Judge to bring in a verdict of guilty against\n someone who is being tried — if in law such usurpation would otherwise\n be contrary to the Constitution.’ (p. 289)\n\n 255. In conclusion the Judicial Committee held that there was interference\n with the functions of the Judiciary and it was not only the likely but the\n intended effect of the impugned enactments, and that was fatal to their\n validity.”\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 11 of 20\n\n\f The ultimate conclusion to which Chief Justice Sikri reached are found in\n paras 292 to 294 at p. 366 of the Report which read as under:\n\n “292. The learned Attorney General said that every provision of the\n Constitution is essential; otherwise it would not have been put in the\n Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every provision of the\n Constitution in the same position. The true position is that every provision\n of the Constitution can be amended provided in the result the basic\n foundation and structure of the Constitution remains the same. The basic\n structure may be said to consist of the following features:\n\n (1) Supremacy of the Constitution;\n\n (2) Republican and democratic form of Government;\n\n (3) Secular character of the Constitution;\n\n (4) Separation of powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the\n Judiciary;\n\n (5) Federal character of the Constitution.\n\n 293. The above structure is built on the basic foundation, i.e., the\n dignity and freedom of the individual. This is of supreme importance.\n This cannot by any form of amendment be destroyed.\n\n 294. The above foundation and the above basic features are easily\n discernible not only from the Preamble but the whole scheme of the\n Constitution, which I have already discussed.”\n\n The other learned Judges constituting the Constitution Bench had\n nothing inconsistent to say in this connection. Thus separation of\n powers between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary is the\n basic feature of the Constitution.\n\n \n34. It has also to be kept in view that judicial independence is the very\n essence and basic structure of the Constitution. We may also usefully\n refer to the latest decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in\n Registrar (Admn.), High Court of \nOrissa v. Sisir Kanta Satapathy\n [(1999)\n 7 SCC 725 : 1999 SCC (L&S) 1373] wherein K. Venkataswami, J.,\n speaking for the Constitution Bench, made the following pertinent\n observations in the very first two paras regarding \nArticles 233\n to 235\n of the Constitution of India: (SCC Headnote)\n\n “An independent Judiciary is one of the basic features of the\n Constitution of the Republic. Indian Constitution has zealously\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 12 of 20\n\n\f guarded independence of Judiciary. Independence of Judiciary is\n doubtless a basic structure of the Constitution but the said concept of\n independence has to be confined within the four corners of the\n Constitution and cannot go beyond the Constitution.”\n\n The Constitution Bench in the aforesaid decision also relied upon the\n observations of this Court in All India Judges' Assn. [(1993) 4 SCC 288\n : 1994 SCC (L&S) 148 : (1993) 25 ATC 818 : AIR 1993 SC 2493]\n wherein on the topic of regulating the service conditions of the\n Judiciary as permitted by \nArticle 235\n read with \nArticle 309\n, it had been\n observed as under: (SCC p. 297, para 10)\n\n “[T]he mere fact that \nArticle 309\n gives power to the Executive and the\n Legislature to prescribe the service conditions of the Judiciary, does\n not mean that the Judiciary should have no say in the matter. It would\n be against the spirit of the Constitution to deny any role to the\n Judiciary in that behalf, for theoretically it would not be impossible for\n the Executive or the Legislature to turn and twist the tail of the\n Judiciary by using the said power. Such a consequence would be\n against one of the seminal mandates of the Constitution, namely, to\n maintain the independence of the Judiciary.”\n\n In view of this settled legal position, therefore, even while operating in the\n permissible field of regulating other conditions of service of already-\n recruited judicial officers by exercising power under \nArticle 309\n, the\n authorities concerned have to keep in view the opinion of the High Court\n of the State concerned and the same cannot be whisked away.\n\n 35. \nIn order to fructify this constitutional intention of preserving the\n independence of the Judiciary and for fructifying this basic\n requirement, the process of recruitment and appointment to the\n District Judiciary with which we are concerned in the present case, is\n insulated from outside legislative interference by the Constitution-\n makers by enacting a complete code for that purpose, as \nlaid down by\n\nArticles 233\n and \n234.\n Consultation with the High Court is, therefore,\n an inevitable essential feature of the exercise contemplated under these\n two articles. If any outside independent interference was envisaged by\n them, nothing prevented the Founding Fathers from making \nArticles\n 233\n and \n234\n subject to the law enacted by the Legislature of States or\n Parliament as was done in the case of other articles, as seen earlier….”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 13 of 20\n\n\fPRINCIPLE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SILENCE\n\n14.While taking note of the doctrine of separation of powers and\n\n independence of the judiciary, coupled with the maintenance and\n\n enhancement of the quality of judging which forms part of the basic\n\n structure doctrine, a decision was consciously taken by the makers of the\n\n Constitution to fix the eligibility criteria only for the category of ‘an\n\n advocate or a pleader.’ At this juncture, the concept of ‘constitutional\n\n silence’ comes into play as the makers of the Constitution deliberately\n\n left certain areas open-ended, keeping in mind the evolving needs of the\n\n society. This concept is invoked to give effect to the essence of the\n\n Constitution. The spirit of this principle has been captured by Thomas\n\n Carlyle, a Scottish Philosopher and Historian, when he famously stated:\n\n \n“Under all speech and writing that is good for anything, there lies a\n silence that is better....”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n This Court had the occasion to deal with the aforesaid principle in the\n\n case of \nBhanumati and Others v. State of U.P. and Others\n, (2010) 12\n\n SCC 1.\n\n “49. Apart from the aforesaid reasons, the arguments by the appellants\n cannot be accepted in view of a very well-known constitutional\n doctrine, namely, the constitutional doctrine of silence. Michael Foley\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 14 of 20\n\n\f in his treatise on The Silence of Constitutions (Routledge, London and\n New York) has argued that in a Constitution “abeyances are valuable,\n therefore, not in spite of their obscurity but because of it. They are\n significant for the attitudes and approaches to the Constitution that\n they evoke, rather than the content or substance of their strictures”.\n (P. 10)\n\n 50. The learned author elaborated this concept further by saying, “Despite\n the absence of any documentary or material form, these abeyances are\n real and are an integral part of any Constitution. What remains\n unwritten and indeterminate can be just as much responsible for the\n operational character and restraining quality of a Constitution as its\n more tangible and codified components.” (P. 82)\n\n 51. Many issues in our constitutional jurisprudence evolved out of this\n doctrine of silence. The basic structure doctrine vis-à-vis \nArticle 368\n of\n the Constitution emerged out of this concept of silence in the\n Constitution. A Constitution which professes to be democratic and\n republican in character and which brings about a revolutionary\n change by the Seventy-third Constitutional Amendment by making\n detailed provision for democratic decentralisation and self-\n\n government on the principle of grass-root democracy cannot be interpreted\n to exclude the provision of no-confidence motion in respect of the office of\n the Chairperson of the panchayat just because of its silence on that aspect.”\n\n (emphasis supplied)\n\n15.One must appreciate the constitutional silence on the eligibility criteria\n\n qua a person in the judicial service, which has accordingly been left to\n\n the discretion and wisdom of the High Court and the Governor of the\n\n State, as per \nArticles 233\n and \n235\n of the Constitution. Therefore, such\n\n an omission was done consciously, as a person in the judicial service has\n\n already been recruited by way of an appointment by the orders of the\n\n Governor, in consultation with the High Court and the State Public\n\n Service Commission.\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 15 of 20\n\n\f16.As discussed, \nArticle 233\n of the Constitution does not place any fetters\n\n on the power of the appointing authority qua the fixation of eligibility\n\n criteria for persons in the judicial service, as circumstances might evolve\n\n over time, and the wisdom of the Constitutional Courts would take care\n\n of it.\n\nELIGIBILITY VIS-À-VIS QUALIFICATION TO THE POST OF A\nDISTRICT JUDGE\n\n17.Provisions in the Constitution use the words “qualification” and\n\n “eligibility” interchangeably. Examples of such provisions are \nArticle\n\n 58\n of the Constitution, which provides for the qualifications for election\n\n as President, \nArticle 66\n of the Constitution, which provides for election\n\n of Vice-President and \nArticle 84\n of the Constitution, which provides for\n\n qualification for membership of the Parliament.\n\n18.The word “eligible” used in \nArticle 233(2)\n of the Constitution must be\n\n read as “qualified.” Thus, a person who has been an advocate or a\n\n pleader for not less than seven years, along with the recommendation of\n\n the High Court is one qualification, and a person in the judicial service\n\n is the other qualification. Both of these qualifications are nothing but\n\n mere gateways for being appointed to the post of a district judge,\n\n facilitating a threshold for entry. However, there is no bar on the High\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 16 of 20\n\n\f Court to fix the qualification, qua persons in the judicial service, with\n\n the approval of the Governor. These qualifications are meant only for\n\n consideration for appointment, subject to the successful completion of\n\n the recruitment process.\n\n19.Accordingly, we are inclined to hold that there is no bar on persons in\n\n the judicial service from competing for the vacancies intended to be\n\n filled through direct recruitment. Any interpretation contrary to the\n\n aforesaid view, would amount to a reservation in favour of ‘an advocate\n\n or a pleader,’ which is not only not contemplated under the Constitution,\n\n but also violates the very spirit enshrined thereunder.\n\n20.Another lens through which the aforesaid proposition can be viewed is\n\n \nArticle 233-A\n of the Constitution, which provides for the validation of\n\n appointments made at any time before the commencement of the\n\n \nConstitution (Twentieth Amendment Act\n), 1966. Clause (a)(i) of \nArticle\n\n 233-A\n of the Constitution encompasses the validation of appointments\n\n from both sources, i.e., a person already in the judicial service and a\n\n person who has been an advocate or a pleader for 7 years or more. The\n\n express reference to both the sources, within the same clause, indicates\n\n the constitutional intent to place the persons in the judicial service at par\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 17 of 20\n\n\f with those from the Bar and thus, they are fully entitled to participate in\n\n the direct recruitment process. The use of the phrase “any such person”\n\n in Clause (a)(ii) of \nArticle 233-A\n of the Constitution, which deals with\n\n the validation of posting, promotion, or transfer, further strengthens their\n\n entitlement to such participation.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n21.While interpreting a constitutional provision, a Court of law must be\n\n conscious not to violate the basic structure of the Constitution, and is\n\n duty-bound to give it a vibrant and organic interpretation. \nArticle 14\n of\n\n the Constitution forms an integral part of the basic structure. Though it\n\n provides for equality before the law, it allows for a reasonable\n\n classification, based upon an intelligible differentia, having a rational\n\n nexus to the object sought to be achieved. Therefore, construing \nArticle\n\n 233(2)\n of the Constitution to be a provision meant only for the category\n\n of ‘an advocate or a pleader’ would certainly be violative of \nArticle 14\n\n of the Constitution, for the purpose of its interpretation. In other words,\n\n a contra view would amount to creation of a quota for ‘an advocate or a\n\n pleader.’ An absolute bar on persons in the judicial service would\n\n certainly prevent meritorious candidates from competing for the\n\nCivil Appeal No. 3947 of 2020 & Connected Matters Page 18 of 20\n\n\f vacancies earmarked for direct recruitment, which would be an affront\n\n to the constitutional spirit.\n\n22.A vibrant and qualitative judiciary fosters greater trust in the institution.\n\n Thus, it is vital to build a strong foundation. Maintaining and enhancing\n\n the quality at the bottom of the judicial pyramid would strengthen the\n\n faith of the public in the subordinate judiciary, which in turn would\n\n reduce the filing of appeals before the High Courts and the Supreme\n\n Court, and therefore considerably reduce the overall pendency.\n\n23.Building a strong foundation and ensuring that the base is of pristine\n\n quality is only possible when the best talent is attracted. Letting go of\n\n emerging talent, by not identifying and nurturing them at the earliest,\n\n would lead to mediocrity as against excellence, which would weaken the\n\n foundation and undermine the entire judicial structure. It is obvious that\n\n greater competition would result in better quality.

The\n expressions “exclusively” and “intended”\n emphasise the fact that the judicial service\n consists only of persons intended to fill up the\n posts of district judges and other civil judicial\n posts and that is the exclusive service of judicial\n officers. Having defined “judicial service” in\n exclusive terms, having provided for appointments to\n that service and having entrusted the control of the\n said service to the care of the High Court, the makers\n of the world (sic) Constitution not have conferred a\n blanket power on the Governor to appoint any person\n from any service as a district judge.”\n [Emphasis supplied]"

It means that appointment as well as\n promotion of persons to be District Judges is a\n matter for the Governor in consultation with the\n High Court and the expression “District Judge”\n includes an Additional District Judge and an\n Additional Sessions Judge. It must be\n remembered that District Judges may be directly\n appointed or may be promoted from the\n subordinate ranks of the judiciary. The article is\n intended to take care of both. It concerns initial\n appointment and initial promotion of persons to\n be either District Judges or any of the categories\n included in it. Further, promotion of District\n Judges is a matter of control of the High Court.\n What is said of District Judges here applies equally\n to additional District Judges and Additional Sessions\n Judges. Therefore when the Governor appointed\n Rajkhowa an Additional District Judge, it could\n either be an “appointment” or a promotion under\n \nArticle 233.\n If it was an appointment it was\n clearly a matter under \nArticle 233.\n If the\n notification be treated as “promotion” of\n Rajkhowa from the junior service to the senior\n service it was a “promotion” of a person to be a\n District Judge which expression, as shown above,\n includes an Additional District Judge. In our\n opinion, it was the latter. Thus there is no doubt\n 39\n\f that the appointment of Rajkhowa as Additional\n District Judge by the Governor was a promotion and\n was made under \nArticle 233.\n It could not be made\n under \nArticle 235\n which deals with posts subordinate\n to a District Judge including an Additional District\n Judge and an Additional Sessions Judge. The High\n Court was in error in holding that the appointment\n of Rajkhowa to the position of an Additional District\n Judge was invalid because the order was made by the\n Governor instead of the High Court. The appointment\n or promotion was perfectly valid and according to the\n Constitution.”\n [Emphasis supplied]"

The\n submission of the learned counsel was that members\n of the Subordinate Judiciary, who had put in 7 years'\n practice at the bar before joining the Subordinate\n Judicial Service and who had gained experience as\n Judicial Officers by joining the Subordinate Judicial\n Service ought to be considered better fitted for\n appointment as District Judges because of the\n additional experience gained by them rather than be\n penalised for that reason. The learned counsel\n submitted that a construction of \nArticle 233\n of the\n Constitution which would render a member of the\n Subordinate Judicial Service ineligible for\n appointment to the Higher Judicial Service because\n of the additional experience gained by him as a\n Judicial Officer would be both unjust and\n paradoxical. It was also suggested that it would be\n extremely anomalous if a member of the Uttar\n Pradesh Judicial Service who on the present\n construction of \nArticle 233\n is ineligible for\n appointment as a District Judge by direct\n recruitment, is nevertheless eligible to be appointed\n as a Judge of the High Court by reason of \nArticle\n 217(2)(aa).\n On the other hand Shri Gopal\n Subramanium, learned counsel for the respondent,\n 46\n\f urged that there was a clear demarcation in the\n Constitution between two sources of recruitment\n namely: (1) those who were in the service of a State\n or Union, and (2) those who were not in such service.\n He contended that the second clause of \nArticle 233"

It is\n therefore, held that the exclusion—by the rules, from\n consideration of judicial officers, to the post of\n District Judges, in the quota earmarked for\n Advocates with the requisite standing, or practice,\n conforms to the mandate of Articles 233-235, and the\n rules are valid.”"

While we have accepted the\nrecommendation of the Shetty Commission which\nwill result in the increase in the pay scales of the\nsubordinate judiciary, it is at the same time\nnecessary that the judicial officers, hard-working as\nthey are, become more efficient. It is imperative that\nthey keep abreast of knowledge of law and the latest\npronouncements, and it is for this reason that the\nShetty Commission has recommended the\nestablishment of a Judicial Academy, which is very\nnecessary. At the same time, we are of the opinion\nthat there has to be certain minimum standard,\nobjectively adjudged, for officers who are to enter the\nHigher Judicial Service as Additional District Judges\nand District Judges. While we agree with the Shetty\nCommission that the recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service i.e. the District Judge cadre from\namongst the advocates should be 25 per cent and the\nprocess of recruitment is to be by a competitive\nexamination, both written and viva voce, we are of\nthe opinion that there should be an objective method\nof testing the suitability of the subordinate judicial\nofficers for promotion to the Higher Judicial Service.\nFurthermore, there should also be an incentive\namongst the relatively junior and other officers to\nimprove and to compete with each other so as to excel\nand get quicker promotion. In this way, we expect\nthat the calibre of the members of the Higher Judicial\nService will further improve. In order to achieve this,\nwhile the ratio of 75 per cent appointment by\npromotion and 25 per cent by direct recruitment to\nthe Higher Judicial Service is maintained, we are,\nhowever, of the opinion that there should be two\nmethods as far as appointment by promotion is\nconcerned : 50 per cent of the total posts in the\nHigher Judicial Service must be filled by promotion\non the basis of principle of merit-cum-seniority. For\nthis purpose, the High Courts should devise and\nevolve a test in order to ascertain and examine the\nlegal knowledge of those candidates and to assess\ntheir continued efficiency with adequate knowledge\nof case law.

The High Courts will have to\nframe a rule in this regard.\n28. As a result of the aforesaid, to recapitulate, we\ndirect that recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service\ni.e. the cadre of District Judges will be:\n (1)(a) 50 per cent by promotion from\n amongst the Civil Judges (Senior Division)\n on the basis of principle of merit-cum-\n seniority and passing a suitability test;\n (b) 25 per cent by promotion strictly on the\n basis of merit through limited competitive\n examination of Civil Judges (Senior\n Division) having not less than five years'\n qualifying service; and\n (c) 25 per cent of the posts shall be filled by\n direct recruitment from amongst the eligible\n advocates on the basis of the written and\n viva voce test conducted by respective High\n Courts.\n (2) Appropriate rules shall be framed as\n above by the High Courts as early as\n possible.\n29. Experience has shown that there has been a\nconstant discontentment amongst the members of\nthe Higher Judicial Service in regard to their seniority\nin service. For over three decades a large number of\ncases have been instituted in order to decide the\nrelative seniority from the officers recruited from the\ntwo different sources, namely, promotees and direct\nrecruits. As a result of the decision today, there will,\nin a way, be three ways of recruitment to the Higher\nJudicial Service. The quota for promotion which we\nhave prescribed is 50 per cent by following the\nprinciple “merit-cum-seniority”, 25 per cent strictly\non merit by limited departmental competitive\nexamination and 25 per cent by direct recruitment.\n 82\n\fExperience has also shown that the least amount of\nlitigation in the country, where quota system in\nrecruitment exists, insofar as seniority is concerned,\nis where a roster system is followed. For example,\nthere is, as per the rules of the Central Government,\na 40-point roster which has been prescribed which\ndeals with the quotas for Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes. Hardly, if ever, there has been a\nlitigation amongst the members of the service after\ntheir recruitment as per the quotas, the seniority is\nfixed by the roster points and irrespective of the fact\nas to when a person is recruited. When roster system\nis followed, there is no question of any dispute\narising. The 40-point roster has been considered and\napproved by this Court in R.K. Sabharwal v. State of\nPunjab [R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab, (1995) 2\nSCC 745 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 548] . One of the methods\nof avoiding any litigation and bringing about\ncertainty in this regard is by specifying quotas in\nrelation to posts and not in relation to the vacancies.\nThis is the basic principle on the basis of which the\n40-point roster works. We direct the High Courts to\nsuitably amend and promulgate seniority rules on\nthe basis of the roster principle as approved by this\nCourt in R.K. Sabharwal case [R.K.\nSabharwal v. State of Punjab, (1995) 2 SCC 745 :\n1995 SCC (L&S) 548] as early as possible. We hope\nthat as a result thereof there would be no further\ndispute in the fixation of seniority. It is obvious that\nthis system can only apply prospectively except\nwhere under the relevant rules seniority is to be\ndetermined on the basis of quota and rotational\nsystem. The existing relative seniority of the\nmembers of the Higher Judicial Service has to be\nprotected but the roster has to be evolved for the\nfuture. Appropriate rules and methods will be\nadopted by the High Courts and approved by the\nStates, wherever necessary by 31-3-2003.”"

While the Union and States have separate legislatures and\n executives, they do not have a separate judiciary. The judiciary has a\n single pyramidal structure with the lower or subordinate courts at the\n bottom, the High Courts in the middle, and the Supreme Court at the\n top. For funding and some administrative purposes, the subordinate\n courts are subject to regulation by the respective States, but they are\n basically under the supervision of the High Courts….The unitary\n character of the judiciary is not an accident but rather a conscious and\n deliberate act of the constitution makers for whom a single integrated\n judiciary and uniformity of law were essential for the maintenance of\n the unity of the country and of uniform standards of judicial behavior\n and independence….”"

It is true, as submitted by learned Senior Counsel, Shri Dwivedi for the\n appellant State that under \nArticle 16(4)\n the State is enabled to provide for\n reservations in services. But so far as “Judicial Service” is concerned,\n such reservation can be made by the Governor, in exercise of his rule-\n making power only after consultation with the High Court. The\n enactment of any statutory provision dehors consultation with the High\n Court for regulating the recruitment to the District Judiciary and to\n the Subordinate Judiciary will clearly fly in the face of the complete\n scheme of recruitment and appointment to the Subordinate Judiciary\n and the exclusive field earmarked in connection with such\n appointments by \nArticles 233\n and \n234.\n It is not as if that the High\n Courts being constitutional functionaries may be oblivious of the need\n for a scheme of reservation if necessary in appropriate cases by\n resorting to the enabling provision under \nArticle 16(4).\n The High\n Courts can get consulted by the Governor for framing appropriate\n rules regarding reservation for governing recruitment under \nArticles\n 233\n and \n234.\n But so long as it is not done, the Legislature cannot, by an\n indirect method, completely bypassing the High Court and exercising\n its legislative power, circumvent and cut across the very scheme of\n recruitment and appointment to the District Judiciary as envisaged by\n the makers of the Constitution. Such an exercise, apart from being\n totally forbidden by the constitutional scheme, will also fall foul on the\n concept relating to “separation of powers between the Legislature, the\n Executive and the Judiciary” as well as the fundamental concept of an\n “independent Judiciary”.
