The service conditions of the\nemployees of the Reserve Bank are governed by the Reserve\nBank of India (Staff) Regulations, 1948 and Administrative\norders passed from time to time and also by Industrial\nDisputes Awards or Settlements by negotiations or settlement\nby collective bargaining. In the Reserve Bank separrate\ndepartmentwise, Groupwise seniority and promotion for cadres\nof officers and non-officers (Award Staff) was prevalent\nfrom time to time.\nIn September 1962, the issue of maintenance of combined\nseniority list at each centre for the purpose of promotions\nwas referred to the National industrial Tribunal presided\nover by Justice K.T. Desai. The recommendations of the said\nDesai Award were approved by the Supreme Court in All India\nReserve Bank Employees' Association v. Reserve Bank of\nIndia, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 25 @ 57 and Reserve Bank of India v.\nN.C. Paliwal & Ors., [1977] 1 S.C.R. 377. In 1970, the\nSupervisory Staff in class I was upgraded to staff officers\nin class I pursuant to the Memorandum of Settlement dated\n9th January, 1970 between\nthe Bank and the All India Supervisory Staff Association,\nsubject to certain conditions. The channel of promotion from\nthe post of clerk (Grade II) is staff officer (Grade A) and\nfurther from that post to the staff officer (Grade B) and so\non upto Grade F. Prior to 6th June 1970, oral interviews of\nall the eligible candidates were held for being considered\nfor promotion. Then Administrative circular No. 20 was\nintroduced for the first time for departmental promotions of\nclerk Grade I/(Assistant) etc. to the post of Staff Officer\nGrade II (Sub-Accountants & Research Superintendent) in all\nthe groups. On 7th May 1972, the Bank took several steps\ntowards equalising promotional opportunities of employees by\nintroducing the Optee Scheme of 1965, the Optee Scheme of\n1966 and finally by entering into a Memorandum of Settlement\ndated 7th May 1972 with the Association accepting the\nprinciple of maintenance of a combined seniority. On or\nabout 7th May 1972, the Bank formulated a \"Scheme for\nPromotion; Staff Officer Grade II\" after giving full\nopportunity to the Association to make its suggestions. On\n7th May 1972 the Bank and the Association further agreed by\nexchange of correspondence that the ratio of direct recruits\nto the total strength of staff officers Grade II shall be at\n17.5% - 82.5%. On 13th May 1972, the Bank introduced the\nAdministrative Circular No. 8 on \"Scheme for Promotion:\nStaff Officers Grade II\". On the same day the Bank\nintroduced simultaneously the Administrative Circular No. 9\non \"Scheme for combined Seniority List and Switch over from\nnon-clerical to clerical cadre with effect from 7th May\n1972, Both the circulars are binding on all employees of the\nBank in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in N.C.\nPaliwal's case. On May 22, 1974, the Bank took a decision\nbased on the recommendations of the cadre Review Committee\nunder the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice J.L. Naim and issued\nAdministrative circular No.15 to prepare a common seniority\nList and to provide for inter group mobility at the lowest\nlevel of officers in Grade A with effect from 1st January\n1970. On or about 7th January 1978, the Bank took further\ndecision, based on the recommendations of two Committees\nheaded by Mr. Justice Naim and Mr. Justice Thareja\nrespectively and issued Administrative Circular No. 8 to\ncombine the seniority of all officers in Grade 'B' and above\nwith effect from 22nd May 1974 with a view to equalise\nopportunity for promotions among officers. Both the\ncirculars Nos. 15 of 1974 and 8 of 1978, were approved by\nthe Supreme Court in V.T. Khanzode & Ors. v. Reserve Bank of\nIndia & Anr., reported in [1982] 2 S.C.C. 7.\n%\nThe respondents who were grade II clerks working at\nNagpur Reserve Bank ever since their employment which\ncommenced somewhere between 1960 and 1965 who were aggrieved\nby Part of Clause II(a)(i) of the scheme for promotion -\nStaff Officers Grade II covered under Administration\nCircular No. 8 challenged its validity averring that under\nthe new scheme chance to appear in the examination depended\nnot on relative merits but merely on the fortuitus\ncircumstances, namely, the number of vacancies occurring in\na particular centre in a panel year which had no nexus with\nthe purpose of promotion viz. to secure efficient cadre of\nstaff officers. The High Court accepted the pleas of the\nrespondents and by its order dated 19th March 1981 struck\ndown that part of clause II(a)(i) of the scheme listed\n\"Number of candidates for the qualifying test\". As a result\nno examination could be held for panel years 1980-81, 1981-\n82 and 1983-84. Hence the appeal by special leave.\nAllowing the appeal and approving the modified scheme\nof 1984 as per the orders and directions of the Supreme\nCourt including holding a referendum, the Court,\n^\nHELD: 1. In service jurisprudence there cannot be any\nservice rule which would satisfy each and every employee and\nits constitutionality has to be judged by considering\nwhether it is fair, reasonable and does justice to the\nmajority of the employees and fortunes of some individuals\nis not the touch-stone. Further, whether there has been\ndenial of equality of the view of promotion or any\nconstitutional right infringed or not cannot be judged,\nwhere interest of large number of people are concerned, in\nthe abstract. [909 D-E; B-C]\nKamal Kanti Dutt & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.,\n[1980] 3 S.C.R. 811 referred to.\n2. Circular No. 9 is a counterpart of Circular No. 8.\nCircular No. 8 having been held valid, by the Supreme Court\nCircular No. 9 must also follow to be good. Circular No. 9\ncannot stand in vaccum and in isolation. It is a step to the\nfulfilment of the object to be achieved by Circular No. 8.\nViewed in that point of view and as a feasibility and having\nregard to the factors and in regard to the history of\nReserve Bank employees, the scheme as modified by the Bank\nand as\naccepted by vast majority indeed an over willing majority of\nthe workmen is a proper and just scheme and does not suffer\nfrom the vice of\narticle 14\nor\narticle 16\nor any other\nconstitutional guarantees. [909 F-G]\n3.1 Settlement of disputes by direct negotiations or\nsettlement through collective bargaining is always to be\npreferred for it is best suited for indusrial peace which is\nthe aim of legislation for settlement of labour disputes.\n[909 H; 910 A]\nNew Standard Engineering Co. Ltd. v. N.L. Abhyankar &\nOrs., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 798 and Tata Engineering & Locomotive\nv. Their Workmen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 929 referred to.\n3.2 The reference held pursuant to the orders of this\nCourt dated 2nd May, 1984 undoubtedly indicates that\nmajority of the employees are in favour of acceptance of the\nmodified settlement. In matters of service conditions it is\ndifficult to evolve as ideal set of norms governing various\nconditions of services and in grey area where service rules\noperated, if more than one view is possible without\nsacrificing either reasons or commonsense the ultimate\nchoice has necessarily to be conditioned by several\nconsiderations ensuring justice to as many as possible and\ninjustice to as few. These principles however, significant\ndo not authorise the majority of the employees to trample\nupon the constitutional guarantees or rights of the\nindividuals or minority employees. Majority cannot thwart or\nbarter away the constitutional rights of the minorities. The\nconstitutional guarantees are to protect this very danger.\nBut in judging the content of the constitutional rights, the\nentire perspective of the equality of opportunity here and\ndenial of equal right in public employment have to be viewed\nin a fair, reasonable and just perspective. Viewed in that\nlight, it is true there may be individual instances\nexemplifying injustices by postponing or delaying the\nchances of promotions of the contesting respondents yet that\ndoes not deny them their constitutional right in its proper\nmeasure, and the considerations that have weighed with the\nmaking of the modified scheme and in light of the other\nconsiderations it must be observed that with whatever care\nand objectivity or foresight any rule is framed, some\nhardship, inconvenience or injustice might to result but the\nparamount consideration is the reconciliation of the\nconflicting claims of two important\nconstituents of service - one which brings fresh clerical\nemployees and the other mature experience. There has been a\nhappy merger of these two considerations in the scheme\nproposed and in that merger, no violation of the guaranteed\nrights of the opposing respondents have occurred. [910 C-H;\n911 A-B]\n3.3 The promotion scheme having been evolved after\ncareful consideration and having been in operation ever\nsince the inception of the Bank with modification from time\nto time as a result of the negotiations under the\nIndustrial\nDisputes Act\nshould not be modified drastically. In such\nmatters one should hasten slowly. [911 B-C]\n4.1 The promotion on the basis of centrewise seniority,\nin the instant case is constitutionally valid, inasmuch as\nthe appellant bank is an undertaking which comes within the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\nand the class III employees\nare fully covered by the definition of the term \"workman\" in\n\nsection 2(s)\nof the said Act and one of the principles\nnormally applicable in fixing their terms and conditions of\nservice is industry-cum-region principle. [893 G-H]\nRamachandra Shankar Deodhar & Ors. v. State of\nMaharashtra & Ors., [1974] 2 S.C.R. 216 distinguished.\nHindustan Antibiotics v. Workmen, [1967] 1 S.C.R. 652\nand All-India Reserve Bank Employees' Association v. Reserve\nBank of India, [1966] 1 S.C.R. referred to.\n4.2 The integration of different cadres into one cadre\ncould not be said to involve any violation of the equality\nclause. The right of promotion should not be confused with\nmere chance of promotion. Though the right to be considered\nfor promotion was a condition of service, mere chances of\npromotion were not. It is clear therefore, that the chances\nof promotion in some areas occur more often in smaller\ncentres than in other bigger centres like Bombay, Calcutta,\nDelhi but that is fortutious and would not really affect the\nquestion, and violate\narticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. The justice of the case should be judged in\nconjunction with other factors, the convenience, the future\nof the family etc. [899 G; 903 E-F]\nKamal Kanti Dutt & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.,\n[1980] 3 S.C.R. 811, at pages 841-842; Mohd. Shujat Ali v.\nUnion of India, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 449 and Reserve Bank of\nIndia v. C.T. Dighe, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 107 at 121-122 referred\nto.\n4.3\nRegulation 31\nof the Reserve Bank of India (Staff)\nRegulations 1948 is subject to the condition that \"unless in\nany case it be otherwise distinctly provided.\" In the\ninstant case, it has been distinctly provided in the\nappointment letters as to where the class III employees of\nthe Bank are liable to serve. All appointment letters issued\nto all staff members appointed in class III and below ever\nsince the inception of the Bank contained, identical or\nsimilar provision specifying the offices in which of the\nBank these employees are required to work. Therefore, there\nwas definite provision contrary to as contemplated by\n\nRegulation 31\nof the Reserve Bank of India (Staff)\nRegulation 1948 and therefore the general provisions of\n\nRegulation 31\nwould not have any application. [904 B-C; D-E]\n4.4 If an All-India cadre is enforced in respect of\nClass III employees, it would result in injustice to all the\nemployees in that class at the injustice to all the\nemployees in that class at the smaller centres for a\nconsiderably long period of time leading to industrial\nunrest. The result of applying the principles of an All-\nIndia cadres for this class of employees would be that the\nsenior-most in that whole cadre All-India wise would alone\nhave to be considered for promotion. In such a case, for a\nconsiderable long time, only employees of the older offices\nnamely, Bombay, Nagpur, Madras, Calcutta and Delhi will have\nto be considered, they being by far senior most among the\nAll-India employees and such a consideration and empanelling\nwould continue for a very long time as the principal basis\nof the settlement was not one of promotion on merit but\nrather an upgradation on mere seniority, the only\nqualification being an examination to determine fitness.\nOnce fitness was determined by the examination the ranking\nin that examination did not come into play thereafter and\nthe successful candidates were again listed according to\ncentrewise seniority in the matter of upgradation and\npromoted as and when vacancies at that centre occur. [905 A-\nE]\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 3234 of\n1981.\nFrom the Judgment and Order dated 19th March, 1981 of\nthe Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 2334 of 1980.\n\nG.B. Pai and R.H. Parihar for the Appellant.\nC.N. Sahasranaman in person, S.P. Sharma in person,\nK.T.A. Anantha Raman, R. Basu Devan, A.K. Goel, Ajit\nPudissery, M.S. Gupta and V.J. Francis for the Respondents.\n\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J. In the Reserve Bank of India\nseparate Departmentwise and Groupwise seniority and\npromotion for cadres of Officers and non-Officers (Award\nStaff) was prevalent. This would be apparent from the\ndecision of this Court in Reserve Bank of India v. N.C.\nPaliwal & Ors., [1977] 1 S.C.R. 377 as well as V.T. Khanzode\nand Ors. v. Reserve Bank of India and Anr., [1982] 2 S.C.C.\n\n7.\nIn September, 1962, need was felt for maintenance of\ncombined seniority list at each centre for the purposes of\npromotions recommended by National Industrial Tribunal\npresided over by Mr. Justice K.T. Desai. The recommendations\nof the said Desai Award for centre-wise combined seniority\nwere approved by this Court in 1966. See in this connection\nthe observations in\nAll India Reserve Bank Employees\nAssociations v. Reserve Bank of India\n, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 25 at\n57 and\nReserve Bank of India v. N.C. Paliwal & Ors.\n,\n(supra).\n\nIn 1970, the Supervisory Staff in Class I was upgraded\nto Staff Officers in Class I pursuant to the Memorandum of\nSettlement dated 9th January, 1970 between the Bank and the\nAll India Supervisory Staff Association, subject to certain\nconditions.\n\nAdministrative Circular No. 20 dated 6th June, 1970 was\nissued on introduction of written examination for\ndepartmental promotions of clerk Grade I/Assistants etc. to\nthe post of Staff Officers Grade II (Sub-Accountants and\nResearch Superintendents) in all the groups. This circular\nwas not made operative.\nOn 7th May, 1972, the Bank took several steps towards\nequalising promotional opportunities of employees by\nintroducing the Optee Scheme of 1965, the Optee Scheme of\n1966 and finally by entering into Memorandum of Settlement\ndated 7th May, 1972 with the Association accepting the\nprinciple of maintenance of a combined seniority list at a\ncentre. See in this connection the observations in\nReserve\nBank of India v. N.C. Paliwal\n, (supra).\n\nOn or about 7th May, 1972, the Bank formulated a Scheme\nfor Promotions : Staff Officer Grade II' after giving full\nopportunity to the Association to make its suggestions. On\n7th May, 1972, the Bank and the Association further agreed\nby exchange of correspondence that the ratio of direct\nrecruits to the total strength of Staff Officers Grade II\nshould be at 17.5% : 82.5%. Reference in this connection may\nbe made to Annexure II & III to the further Affidavit for\nthe bank filed on 27th August, 1982 and which are in the\nappeal Paper Book at p. 134 onwards.\n\nOn 13th May, 1972, the Bank introduced the\nAdministrative Circular No. 8 dated 13th May, 1972 on\n'Scheme for Promotions - Staff Officers Grade II' which is\nbinding on all employees of the Bank. On the same day the\nBank introduced simultaneously the Administrative Circular\nNo. 9 on 'Scheme for Combined Seniority List and switchover\nfrom non-clerical to clerical cadre' with effect from 7th\nMay, 1972 which is binding on all employees of the Bank. The\nConstitutional valdity of this scheme was upheld by this\nCourt in\nReserve Bank of India v. N.C. Paliwal\n(supra).\n\nOn 22nd May, 1974, the Bank took a decision, based on\nthe recommendations of the Cadre Review Committee under the\nChairmanship of Mr. Justice J.L. Nain and issued the\nAdministrative Circular No. 15 dated 22nd May, 1974 to\nprepare a common seniority list and to provide for inter\ngroup mobility at the lowest level of officers in Grade 'A'\nwith effect from 1st January, 1970. See\nV.T. Khanzode & Ors.\nv. Reserve Bank of India\n, (supra).\n\nOn or about 7th January, 1978, the Bank took further\ndecision, based on the recommendations of two Committees,\none headed by Mr. Justice Nain and another headed by Mr.\nThareja,\nand issued Administrative Circular No. 8 dated 7th January,\n1978 to combine the seniority of all officers in Grade 'B'\nand above with effect from 22nd May, 1974 with a view to\nequalise opportunity for promotions among officers.\nIn this\nconnection, reference may also be made to\nV.T. Khanzode &\nOrs. v. Reserve Bank of India\n, (supra).\n\nThis appeal arises from a decision of the division\nbench of the Bombay High Court, Nagpur dated 19th March,\n1981 whereby it has struck down a part of clause (II)(a)(i)\nof 'the Scheme for Promotion - Staff Officers Grade II (now\ndesignated Grade 'A') covered under the Administration\nCircular No. 8 dated 13th May, 1972. It may be mentioned\nthat as a result no examination could be held for panel\nyears 1980-81, 1981-82, and 1982-83.. The said clause was as\nfollows :\n\n\"II. Number of candidates for the qualifying\ntest:-\n\n(a)(i) As estimate of the vacancies anticipated to\noccur in each office during a 'panel year' i.e.\n1st September to 31st August will be declared by\nthe Bank in advance and the number of candidates\nin that office to be called for the test in order\nto fill those vacancies in that office will not\nexceed twice the number of such vacancies subject\nto sub-clause.....\"\n\nIt may be mentioned that the decision was rendered in\nrespect of a petition under\nArticle 226\nof the Constitution\nby three petitioners who were Grade II clerks working at\nNagpur Reserve Bank ever since their employment which\ncommenced somewhere between 1960 to 1965. The Reserve Bank\nhas its offices at nearly 15 centres throughout India. The\nservice conditions were governed by the Reserve Bank of\nIndia (Staff) Regulations, 1948 (hereinafter called\n\"Regulations\").\n\nThe High Court by its order which is under appeal has\nset aside the impugned part of the scheme. It would be\nnecessary to refer to\nthe said judgment\nbriefly.\n\nIt may be mentioned that this judgment of the High\nCourt was delivered on 19th March, 1981. This Court granted\nspecial leave against\nthe said judgment\non 4th December,\n1981. Then\nafter that on 5th March, 1982, this Court upheld the\nconstitutional validity of the Administrative Circular No. 8\ndated 7th January, 1978 to combine the seniorty of all\nOfficers.\n\nSee\nV.T. Khanzode & Ors. v. Reserve Bank of India\n,\n(supra). This Court further directed on 29th July, 1982 that\nin the interest of justice All India Reserve Bank Employees\nClass III Workmen Associations and All India Reserve Bank\nWorkers Organisation be added as the party-respondents, and\nthe appeal was heard for some time. Then this appeal after\nhearing was adjourned and this Court directed the Reserve\nBank to frame a new scheme for promotion by order dated 20th\nOctober, 1982. On 13th December, 1982, the Bank filed\nfurther affidavit, inter alia, annexing revised draft of\nclause II to the Scheme for Promotion of Staff Officers\nGrade 'A' annexed to the Administrative Circular No. 8. This\nwas submitted for acceptance on behalf of the appellants\nbefore us. The amendment was opposed by the opposing\nrespondents by their Affidavits-in-Opposition.\n\nOn 21st March, 1983, it is stated, that the Bank\nentered into a settlement by exchange of letters with All\nIndia Reserve Bank Employees Association which is recognised\nand representative Union of Class III Workmen employees. The\nBank thereafter filed a Rajoinder setting out principles\ngoverning recruitment and promotion of Staff Officers Grade\n'A' on 22nd February, 1983 including the modification of the\nexisting scheme mutually agreed between the Bank and the\nAssociation. On 2nd May, 1984, this Court directed that the\nsettlement between the Bank and the Association be referred\nto Class III employees and opinion of the majority shall be\ntaken on the basis of referendum by secret ballot and the\nresult of the referendum should be communicated to this\nCourt on 16th July, 1984 and the appeal to be heard\nthereafter. The result of the referendum by secret ballot\nwas filed by the Bank by an Affidavit. The summary of the\nresult of the referendum seems to be as follows :\n\n\"PARTICULARS TOTAL VOTES PERCENTAGE TO\n------------ ----------- --------------\nCAST AGGREGATE NO.\nOF VOTES CAST\n----------- ----------- --------------\nNo. of votes\naccepting the\nSettlement 11,309 67.67%\nNo. of votes not\naccepting the\nSettlement 5,277 31.58%\nNo. of votes\ndeclared invalid 126 00.75%\n--------- ---------\n16,712 100.00%\n---------- ----------\nTotal number of eligible voters : 18,953\nTotal votes polled :16,712 (88.18%)\"\n\nThe main question which needs determination is whether\npart of the scheme mentioned before introduced by the\nReserve Bank of India is violative of guarantee of equality\nbefore law and of equal opportunity in public employment as\nenshrined in\narticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution. The\nHigh Court noted that the point arose at the instance of\nthree petitioners who were Grade II working at Nagpur branch\nof Reserve Bank ever since their employment which commenced\nsomewhere between 1960 to 1965.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has its offices at nearly 15 centres\nthroughout India. The channel of promotion from the post of\nClerk (Grade II) is Staff Officer (Grade A) and further from\nthe post to the Staff Officer (Grade B) and so on upto Grade\nF. Prior to 6th June, 1970, oral interviews of all the\neligible candidates were held for being considered for\npromotion. Then Administration Circular No. 20 was issued\nintroducing scheme of Written Examination for the first time\nfor giving departmental promotions. The learned judges of\nthe High Court were of the view that perhaps this was done\nto introduce element of objectivity in the test. Candidates\nwho passed the said qualifying examination were included in\nthe `fit' list and became eligible being considered for\npromotion to the next higher post. The High Court was\nconcerned, as mentioned hereinbefore, with the said new\nscheme which is introduced by Circular dated 13th May, 1972.\n\nAnalysing the said scheme, the High Court was of the\nview that under the new scheme candidates from a particular\ncentre numbering twice the anticipated vacancies in that\ncentre alone were eligible to appear in the departmental\nexamination and consequently to qualify for promotion. The\ngrievance of the petitioners before the High Court was that\nunder the new scheme, chance to appear in the examination\ndepended not on relative merits but merely on the fortuitous\ncircumstances, namely, the number of vacancies occurring in\na particular centre in a panel year. According to the\npetitioners, this had no nexus with the prupose of promotion\nviz. to secure efficient cadre of Staff Officers and\ntherefore the scheme, according to the petitioners, was bad\nin law. The High Court found considerable force in this\nsubmission.\n\nIn the impugned judgment under appeal the High Court\nrelied on\nRamchandra Shankar Deodhar & Ors. v. State of\nMaharashtra & Ors.\n, [1974] 2 S.C.R. 216. According to the\nHigh Court the promotion on the basis of Centre-wise\nseniority was opposed to\nthe said decision\nof this Court.\nThere, the petitioners were Tahsildars in the erstwhile\nState of Hyderabad. After the new State of Bombay was\nconstituted with territories drawn from various existing\nStates including Hyderabad under the\nStates Reorganisation\nAct, 1956\n, equation of posts and determination of inter se\nseniority was done by the Allocated Government Servants'\n(Absorption, Seniority, Pay and Allowances) Rules, 1957.\nUnder these rules of 1957, the Government of Bombay declared\nthat the posts of Mamlatdar in the former State of Bombay\nshould be deemed to be equivalent to the posts of Tahsildar\nfrom the former State of Hyderabad and the posts of Deputy\nCollector in the former State of Bombay should be deemed to\nbe equivalent to the posts of Deputy Collector allocated\nfrom the former State of Hyderabad. The recruitment to the\nposts of Deputy Collector was provided for by Rules of 30th\nJuly, 1959 (called 1959 Rules) according to which vacancies\nto the posts of Deputy Collector were to be filled from\nthree sources 50% by nomination on the basis of the result\nof competitive examination; 25% by directly recruited\nMamlatdars who have put in at least seven years' service\nincluding the period spent on probation and the remaining\n25% by Mamlatdars promoted from the lower ranks in the\nrevene departments. The reservation of 25% in favour of\ndirectly recruited Mamlatdars was made by the second proviso\nof rule (1) of the Rules. On 7th April, 1961 the Government\nlaid down the principles for regulating the preparation and\nrevision of select list of Mamlatdars/Tahsildars fit to be\nappointed. It was held by this Court by a bench of five\nlearned judges that the second proviso to rule (1) of the\n1959 Rules was void as being violative of\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution. This Court was of the view that the procedure\nfor promotion to the cadre of Deputy Collectors followed by\nthe State Government was also invalid on the ground that it\ndenied equality of opportunity of promotion and was\ntherefore hit by\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution and hence\nthe Government resolution dated 7th April, 1961 was quashed.\n\nWhat was done in the aforesaid case was to have an\nintegrated service of Mamlatdars for the purpose of\npromotions to Deputy Collectors' grade which was admittedly\na State-wise grade and that promotion was on the basis of\nmerit-cum-seniority. It was found that select list based on\nmerit and seniority Division-wise for promotion to higher\ngrade, viz. that of the Deputy Collector and these lists\nwere liable to be varied from time to time on periodical\nassessment of merits of the incumbents in that list, and\nthis Court was of the view that it might lead to injustice\nin that if promotions were made from these lists Division-\nwise there was a possibility of a less meritorious candidate\nwith lesser seniority being promoted in preference to a more\nmeritorious candidate elsewhere. In the instant appeal it is\nnecessary to consider the question of promotions from the\nCentre-wise cadre to an All India Cadre and not a State\ncadre. If, therefore, any analogy or parallel has to be\nsought, then it must be from the All India cadre of the\nGovernment of India service. It may be noted that in an All\nIndia Service considerations other than merit on seniority\nhave to be taken into account. In the appellant Bank, the\nprocedure is to give a qualifying test just to ascertain the\nfitness for upgradation. In effect upgradation is really\ndone on the basis of seniority alone subject to fitness.\nIn\n\nDeodhar\n's case, the emphasis was rather on merit rating and\nthe discrimination was implicit against more meritorious\ncandidates with higher seniority. But in the instant case\nthe appellant Bank is an undertaking which comes within the\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act, 1947\nand the Class III employees\nare fully covered by the definition of the term \"workman\" in\n\nsection 2(s)\nof the said Act and one of the principles\nnormally applicable in fixing their terms and conditions of\nservice is the Industry cum region principle.\n\nIt was stated\nby this Court in\nHindustan Antibiotics v. Workmen\n, [1967] 1\nS.C.R. 652 that those principles should also be\napplied to State-run industries. The question whether the\nrecruitment to the lowest cadre of officers viz.\n\nClass A\nofficers should be essentially from Class III employees by\npromotion directly came up for consideration by this Court\nin\nAll-India Reserve Bank Employees' Association v. Reserve\nBank of India\n, [1966] 1 S.C.R. 25 and this Court held that a\nworkman can raise a dispute on such a point. It was in that\ncontext that a dispute was in fact raised and a settlement\nunder\nsection 18(1)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was\nentered into with the recognised union namely All India Bank\nEmployees Association on 7th May, 1972, and the\nAdministration Circular AC-9 and AC-8 dated 13th May, 1972\nissued.\n\nThe High Court in the impugned judgment proceeded on\nthe basis that in fact the Class III employees of the\nReserve Bank of India belonged to an All India Cadre freely\ntransferable from one place to another. This aspect will be\ndealt with later on.\n\nThe division bench of the Bombay High Court in the\ndecision under appeal found that the ratio of\nthe said\ndecision\nin\nDeodhar\n's case applied to the facts and\ncircumstances of the instant case because the cadre of clerk\n(Grade II) was all India cadre and not a local cadre and\nsecondly the post of Staff Officer (Group A) was a\ntransferable one even in practice was a common point.\nExamination was also held on All-India basis.\n\nTherefore, the\nHigh Court was of the view that even if it was held that the\npetitioner's post was not of All India cadre, it would make\nno difference for applicability of the principle\nlaid down\nby\nthis Court in\nDeodhar\n's case (supra).\n\nPromotion was included in the ambit of equality of\nemployment or appointment under\narticle 16\nof the\nConstitution, according to the Bombay High Court. The Bombay\nHigh Court noted that there were very junior officers like\nrespondents 4 and 5 before the Bombay High Court who had\nbeen posted then at Bhopal office. The petitioners before\nthe Bombay High Court were otherwise qualified and confirmed\nemployees having 15 years service to their credit and yet\nthey did not get the chance to appear in examination as\nemployees and some respondents got their chances even though\nthey were appointees of 1980 and were not even confirmed.\nThe\nrespondents 4 and 5 before the Bombay High Court were given\nthe benefit not on the basis of comparative merit but only\non the basis, according to the Bombay High Court, of\nfortuitous event that there had been vacancies in Bhopal\noffice. Therefore, the basis on which the scheme provided\nwas promotion according to the vacancies in the zonal\noffices. This circumstance of anticipated vacancies in the\nzonal offices has no nexus, according to the Bombay High\nCourt, to the merit-cum-seniority aspect.\nThe Bombay High\nCourt also could not sustain the contention urged on behalf\nof the appellant before us that the scheme was contractual\nand therefore was binding on the petitioners. It was\nsubmitted that the petitioners before the Bombay High Court\nand the three respondents before us were not members of the\nunion and were not parties to the agreement mentioned\nbefore. Moreover, according to the High Court, by agreement\none could not give up one's right. It was contended before\nthe High Court that the validity of the scheme had been\nupheld by the decision of this Court in the case of\nReserve\nBank of India v. N.C. Paliwal & Ors.\n, (supra) where one part\nof the scheme came up for scrutiny, but according to the\nHigh Court as this point was not the subject matter of\nscrutiny\n,\nthe said decision\ndid not affect the position.\n\nThe main grounds on which the High court of Bombay set\naside the impugned portion of the circular which has been\nset out hereinbefore was the position that the presumption\nthat the staff from which the promotion was made namely\nClass III employees, clerical and non-clerical belonged to\nan All-India cadre and that promotion on the basis of\ncentre-wise seniority was opposed to the decision of this\nCourt in the case of\nR.S. Deodhar\n(supra).\n\nThe three petitioners in the court below namely Shri\nC.N. Sahasranaman, Shri R. Raman and Shri S.D. Peshkar who\nwere the three staff members in the employment of the\nappellant Reserve Bank of India are respondents to this\nappeal. Intervention has been permitted by the Court during\nthe course of the proceedings by the All India Reserve Bank\nEmployees' Association, the recognised union who represented\nthe majority of the workmen, and the All India Reserve Bank\nWorkers Organisation who represented the minority of the\nworkers both of whom have been made party-respondents. The\nother interveners are All-India Reserve Bank Employees\nFederation at Hyderabad and All-India Reserve Bank Staff\nAssociation. The majority recognised union as well as the\nlast mentioned union are supporting the stand taken by the\nappellant bank.\n\nIn order to appreciate the controversy in this case, it\nwas highlighted before us that since the inception of the\nbank, separate department-wise and group-wise seniority for\npromotion to the cadre of officers and non-officers were\nmaintained by the bank.\n\nIn 1972, following with recognised union, a combined\nseniority list was maintained as a result of the settlement\nand the two circulars A.C. Nos. 8 and 9 both dated 13th May,\n1972. These are two annexures being Annexures 'A' and 'B' to\nthe special leave petition to this Court which are in the\nPaper Book of this appeal. Annexure 'A' deals with the\nscheme for combined seniority list and switchover from non-\nclerical to clerical cadre. It is not necessary to set out\nin extenso the detailed scheme. In this scheme all employees\nin Class III non-clerical cadre substantively in the\ncategories that have been listed as groups I, III, IV and V\nin the annexure who were graduates or had passed both parts\nof Institute of Bankers Examination would be eligible to\nexercise an option in accordance with sub-clause (a) or (b)\nof clause 2 to be transferred, automatically and without any\nscreening, to posts in the clercial cadre and also to vacant\nand other posts than purely stop gap or short term nature,\nsubject to sub-clause (b) mentioned in the scheme. Combined\nseniority scheme introduced by the Reserve Bank to equalise\nopportunity of confirmation and promotion of class under the\noptee scheme came up for consideration by this Court in\n\nReserve Bank of India v. N.C. Paliwal & Ors.\n, (supra). There\nthe Court noted that at every centre of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia, there were five departments, the General Department\nand four Specialised Departments. There was a separate\nseniority list for the employees in each Department at each\ncentre and confirmation and promotion of employees was only\nin the vacancies arising within their Department at each\ncentre. There were two grades of clerks in each Department,\nnamely, Grade I and Grade II. The pay scales of Grade I and\nGrade II clerks in all the\ndepartments were the same and their conditions of service\nwere also identical. There was automatic promotion from\nGrade II to Grade I. It is not necessary to set out in\ndetails the consequences. But it may be mentioned that this\noptee scheme gave rise to dissatisfaction amongst the\nemployees in the General Department and they claimed equal\nopportunities for having combined seniority but justified a\nseparate seniority list on the ground that work in each\nDepartment was of a special nature and their\ninterchangeability was undesirable and hard to achieve. As a\nresult of the recommendations of the National Tribunal,\nhowever, the Reserve Bank introduced the optee scheme 1965\nas a first step towards equalisation of opportunity. Under\nthe scheme, the option to go over to the specialised\nDepartment was confined to confirmed Grade II clerks and\nofficiating Grade I class in the general department. If he\nexercised option, he was eligible to be selected. If he was\nselected, he would be entitled to be absorbed only as Grade\nII clerk in one of the specialised departments with the\nresult that if he was an officiating Grade I in the General\nDepartment at the time of the exercise of the option, he\nwould lose the benefit of officiation in Grade I in the\ngeneral department as also the monetary benefit of Rs. 15.\nHis seniority in the cadre of Grade II clerks in the\nspecialised department in which he was absorbed would be\ndetermined on the basis of his length of service calculated\nfrom the date of his recruitment if he was a graduate when\nhe joined service, or from the date of his graduation if he\nbecame a graduate whilst in service.\n\nThe petitioners\nin that case\nand some others were, at\nthe time of introduction of the Optee Scheme, confirmed\nGrade II clerks in the general department and some of them\nwere officiating in the general department as Grade I\nclerks. They exercised the option under the Optee Scheme and\nwere absorbed substantively as confirmed Grade II clerks in\none or the other of the specialised departments. The clerks,\nother than the petitioners were, in due course, in order of\nseniority, promoted as officiating Grade I clerks in their\nrespective specialised departments. But before the turn of\nthe petitioners for promotion came, a new Scheme was\nintroduced on 13th May, 1972 as a result of continuous\nagitation by the employees for full equalisation of\nopportunities between the general department and the\nspecialised departments. The\nscheme was known as the Combined Seniority Scheme, and it\nsuperseded the Optee Scheme. It consisted of two parts as\nmentioned hereinbefore. One part provided for the\nintegration of the clerical staff of the General Department\nwith the clerical staff of the Specialised Departments, this\nis annexure 'A' of the present Paper Book and the other\nwhich is annexure 'B' in the present Paper Book for the\nintegration of the non-clerical staff with the clerical\nstaff in all the Departments. The Combinted Seniority Scheme\ngave an option to the non-clerical employees to be\ntransferred to posts in the clerical cadre, but in the\ninterest of efficiency, prescribed a qualification that only\nthose employees in non-clerical cadre would be transferred\nwho were either graduates or had passed both parts of\nInstitute of Bankers' Examination. For determining their\nseniority vis-a-vis those in the clerical cadre, the\nCombinted Seniority Scheme adopted the rule that 1/3 of\ntheir total non-clerical service until 7th May, 1972 (the\ndate on which agreement was reached at between the Bank and\nits employees on the terms of the Combined Seniority Scheme)\nor the date of acquiring the qualification should be taken\ninto account.\n\nAllowing the appeal from the High Court and upholding\nthe validity of the Combined Seniority Scheme, this Court\nheld that assuming that the Reserve Bank was State under\n\narticle 12\nof the Constitution and therefore, subject to\n\narticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution, by the mere\nintroduction of the Optee Scheme, no promise or assurance\ncould be spelt out on the part of the Bank not to take any\nsteps towards integration of other employees not covered by\nthe Optee Scheme. The Reserve Bank, could not, on any\nprinciple of law or by any process of implication, be held\nbound to hold its hands in the matter of further\nintegration, until the petitioners were promoted in the\nSpecialised Departments. The only object of the Optee Scheme\nwas to equalise the promotional opportunities of Grade II\nclerks in the General Department with those of Grade II\nclerks in the Specialised Departments by giving an option to\nthe former to be absorbed in the latter. The object was\ncarried out as soon as the petitioners and other Grade II\nclerks in the General Departent opted to be transferred to\nthe Specialised Departments. Then they became Grade II\nclerks in the specialised departments having the same\npromotional opportunities as the original Grade II clerks in\nthe\nspecialised departments. There was no assurance given by the\nBank that the promotional opportunities available to Grade\nII clerks in the Specialised Departments would not be\ndiminished. This Court in\nthe said decision\nwas of the view\nthat the Combined Seniority Scheme did not affect the\npromotional opportunities of all Grade II clerks in the\nSpecialised Departments, irrespective of whether they were\noriginal or transferee Grade II clerks. It did not\ndiscriminate between transferee Grade II clerks and original\nGrade II clerks. There was no breach of the principle that\nthe promotional opportunities of transferee Grade II clerks\nshould be equal to those of original Grade II clerks. The\nfact that some of the Grade II clerks, junior to the\npetitioners, had become Grade I clerks in the general\ndepartments, and so could be equated only with Grade I\nclerks in the specialised departments was a wholly\nfortuitous result, according to this Court. This Court noted\nthat it might cause heart-burning amongst the petitioners\nthat they were still continuing to be Grade II clerks but\nwhenever services were integrated, some hardship was bound\nto result as a necessary consequence of integration. This\n\nCourt further held\nthat Reserve Bank did not undertake that\nit would not take any steps for bringing about total\nintegration of the clerical services until all the\ntransferee Grade II clerks were promoted. The Bank was\nentitled to introduce the Combined Seniority Scheme at any\ntime it thought fit and its validity could not be assailed\non the ground that it was introduced at a time when some of\nthe transferee Grade II clerks still remained to be promoted\nand so was discriminatory against them.\nThe fact that some\ntransferee Grade II clerks had already obtained promotion as\nGrade I clerks in the Specialised Departments by the time\nthe Cabinet Seniority Scheme was introduced, was all part of\nthe exigencies of service and in law no grievance could be\nmade against it.\n\nThe integration of different cadres into one cadre\ncould not be said to involve any violation of the equality\nclause, according to this Court. Therefore, the first part\nof the scheme for combination stands affirmed by this Court\nin\nN.C. Paliwal\n's case (supra).\n\nIt may be mentioned that it is the case of the Bank\nthat the settlement and the circulars namely Circulars Nos.\n8 and 9 referred to hereinbefore both dated 13th July, 1973\nwere the\nculmination of a long process of negotiation and assessment\nby the bank. Reference was made to the observations in the\nAward of the National Tribunal presided over by Justice K.T.\nDesai.\nIndeed, this court referred to\nthe said decision\nof\nJustice K.T. Desai at page 382 and quoted from the said\nreport. Justice Desai had observed that it was desirable\nwhen it was possible, without detriment to the Bank and\nwithout affecting the efficiency, to group employees in a\nparticular category serving in different departments at one\nCentre together for the purpose of being considered for\npromotion that a common seniority list of such employees\nshould be maintained. The same would result in opening up\nequal avenues of promotion for a large number of employees\nand there would be lesser sense of frustration and greater\npeace of mind among the employees.\n\nThese observations of the\nNational Tribunal were also approved by this Court in\nAll\nIndia Bank Employees Association v. Reserve Bank of India\n,\n[1966] 1 S.C.R. 25 at 57.\n\nIn\nReserve Bank of India v. N.C. Paliwal & Ors.\n,\n(supra), at page 385 of the report, it was observed, inter\nalia, as follows :\n\n\"The Association continued to agitate for\nacceptance of its demand and ultimately, as a\nresult of negotiations, an agreement dated 7th\nMay, 1972 was arrived at between the Reserve Bank\nand the Association by which the demand of the\nAssociation was substantially conceded and the\nprinciple of a combined seniority list was\naccepted by the Reserve Bank. The petitioners and\nsome other employees were, however, not members of\nthe Association and they refused to accept the\nterms of this agreement and hence the Reserve Bank\nissued a Circular dated 13th May, 1972 introducing\na Scheme for combined seniority list and switched\nover from non-clerical to clerical cadre with\neffect from 7th May, 1972. This Scheme was\nsubstantially in the same terms as the agreement\ndated 7th May, 1972 and we shall hereafter, for\nthe sake of convenience, refer to this Scheme as\nthe Combined Seniority Scheme.\nIt may be mentioned as was placed before us that before\na combined list at the centre was introduced, the provision\nwas based on department-wise seniority at each centre and\nthe working of the Reserve Bank department-wise had been\nexplained in the\nPaliwal\n's case by this Court at pages 380\nand 381 of the report.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the Circular\nAC-9 dated 13th May, 1972 which was issued as mentioned\nbefore following the statutory settlement dated the 7th May,\n1972 under\nsection 18(1)\nof the Industrial Disputes Act,\n1947 was upheld in\nPaliwal\n's case at page 380-382. This\nCircular was not challenged before the Bombay High Court.\nThe resulting position is that the centre-wise seniority is\nthe established position and whatever promotions have to be\neffected must be based on the centre-wise seniority,\naccording to the appellant. The other part of the Circular\ni.e. Circular AC-8 dated 13th May, 1972 only laid down\ncertain procedural aspects of promotion from clerical to\nnon-clerical (Officer cadre) and even if any part of\nCircular AC-8 was set aside, it would not substantially\naffect the stand of the appellant Bank that the promotions\nare and would be made on the basis of combined seniority. It\nis the case of the Bank that the principle of centre-wise\nseniority was evolved after considerable discussion and\ndebate with all the concerned interests, viz.\n\nwho were\nrepresented by the recognised union, i.e, the All-India\nReserve Bank Employees' Association and all the view points,\naccording to the Bank, were considered by the National\nTribunal and this Court had, as mentioned hereinbefore, in\nthe two decisions on two different occasions, upheld the\nvalidity of the combined seniority scheme; namely\nAll India\nReserve Bank Employees' Association v. Reserve Bank of\nIndia\n, at page 57 and\nReserve Bank of India v. N.C. Paliwal\n,\n(supra) at pages 380-382.\n\nIndeed in the last mentioned case at page 394, the\nvalidity of the combined seniority list has been\nsubsequently upheld by this Court.\n\nThe controversy in this appeal lies within a narrow\narea but it has been urged against a vast compass and\nnecessarily would require examination of some aspects which\nare strictly not germane to the present issue.\n\nIt has to be borne in mind as has been mentioned\nherein-\nbefore that A.C. 9 dated 13th May, 1972 has received the\nacceptance and approval of this case in\nPaliwal\n's case and\nA.C. 9 and A.C. 8 form an integral part of the promotion and\nregulation of the employment of the staff.\n\nIt was further emphasised from the point of view of\njustice and fairness that for a large majority of employees\nof the Bank, the maintenance of centre-wise seniority was\nessential. If Class III clerical and non-clerical staff are\ntreated as an All-India cadre, both the employees as well as\nthe Bank would find themselves in a difficult position\nbecause the employees will render themselves to be freely\ntransferable from one area to another and particularly for\nthose employees who are being transferred outside Bombay,\nCalcutta and Delhi, may find it extremely difficult,\naccording to the Bank, to get housing accommodation (as the\nBank woud not be in a position to offer housing\naccommodation to all its employees). In such a situation, it\nwas submitted, it would become a problem of discipline for\nenforcement of transfer made if the same is refused by the\nemployees. It was, therefore, in those circumstances that\ntaking a pragmatic view the Bank had so far not insisted on\nestablishing an All-India cadre as far as the non-officer\nstaff was concerned. To add to the problem of accommodation,\nthere would be the problem of children's education at the\nnew centres. The integration of various centre-wise grades\ninto one All-India grade would also pose considerable\nadministrative problems.\n\nIn\nV.T. Khanzode v. Reserve Bank of India\n, (supra), it\nwas noted that the private interest of employees of public\nundertakings should not override public interest and an\neffort had to be made to harmonize the two considerations.\nNo scheme governing service matters could be foolproof and\nsome section or the other of employees was bound to feel\naggrieved on the score of its expectations being falsified\nor remaining to be fulfilled. Arbitrariness, irrationality,\nperversity and mala fide will, of course, render any scheme\nunconstitutional but the fact that the scheme does no\nsatisfy the expectations of every employee was no evidence\nof these. It was further observed that the contentions of\nvariations of the service rules had to be judged in the\nlight of the historical data governing the constitution and\nManagement of the Services under Reserve Bank of India from\ntime to time. Without an\nawareness of the history leading to the events which the\npetitioners have challenged as unconstitutional, it would\nnot be possible either to apprciate the position or to\nprovide an answer to it. These observations were made in\nconnection with the evaluation of integrated seniority list\nfor the officers Grade B and above.\n\nIn\nKamal Kanti Dutt & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n,\n[1980] 3 S.C.R. 811, at pages 841-842 this Court emphasised\nthat in matters like formulation of seniority list where, in\nrespect of the rules of promotion, more than one view was\npossible and that a choice had to be necessarily conditioned\nby several considerations ensuring justice to as many as\npossible and injustice to as few, it was not safe to test\nthe constitutionality of service rule on the touch stone of\nfortunes of individuals.\n\nThis Court had also observed that the right of\npromotion should not be confused with mere chance of\npromotion. Though the right to be considered for promotion\nwas a condition of service, mere chances of promotion were\nnot. See Mohd. shujat Ali v. Union of India, [1975] 1 S.C.R.\n\n449. See also in this connection the observations in R.S.\nDeodhar v. State of Maharashtra, (supra) at p. 230 and\n\nReserve Bank of India v. C.T. Dighe\n, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 107 at\n121-122.\n\nIt is apparent, therefore, that the chances of\npromotion in some areas occur more often in smaller centres\nthan in other bigger centres like Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi\nbut that is fortutious and would not really affect the\nquestion, and violate\narticles 14\nand\nof the\nConstitution. The justice of the case should be judged in\nconjunction with other factors, the convenience, the future\nof the family etc.\nThe High Court proceeded, inter alia, on the basis that\nthe fact that Class III employees of the Bank belonged to an\nAll-India cadre freely transferable from one place to\nanother.\n\nRegulation 31\nof the Reserve Bank of India (Staff)\nRegulations, 1948 which is in Chapter IV namely; Conduct,\nDisciplince and Appeals, is as follows :\n\n\"Unless in any case it be otherwise distinctly\nprovided, the whole time of an employee shall be\nat the disposal of the Bank, and he shall serve\nthe Bank in its business in such capacity and at\nsuch place as he may from time to time be\ndirected.\"\n\nRegulation 31\nas indicated is subject to the condition\nthat 'unless in any case it be otherwise distinctly\nprovided'. In the instant case, it has been distinctly\nprovided in the appointment letters as to where the Class\nIII employees of the Bank are liable to serve. See for\ninstance, the specimen copy at page 107 of the Paper Book\nwhich clearly, inter alia, provides as follows :\n\n\"He/She is liable to be posted either as Coin-Note\nExaminer Gr.II or as Clerk Gr.II in any of the\ndepartment of the Bank at Bombay (Fort) or Byculla\nOffices.\"\n\nAll appointment letters issued to all staff members\nappointed in Class III and below ever since the inception of\nthe Bank contained, according to the Bank, identical or\nsimilar provision specifying the offices in which of the\nBank these employees are required to work. It appears,\ntherefore, there was definite provision contrary to as\ncontemplated by\nRegulation 31\nof the Reserve Bank of India,\n(Staff) Regulation 1948 and therefore the general provisions\nof\nRegulation 31\nwould not have any application. In\ncontrast, the appointment letters issued to the officers had\nalways invoked general provisions of\nRegulation 31\ngiving\nfull power to the management of the Bank to post or transfer\nthe officers in any office situated in India. For this\npurpose, specimen appointment letter to an officer in Grade\nA may be referred to. See in this connection pages 98 to 108\nof the paper book wherein it is stated in (xi) as follows:\n\n\"Posting and liability for transfer:\n\nYou are liable to be posted in any of the offices\nof the Bank and to work in any of its departments\nor the departments/offices of its associate\ninstitutions as the Bank may decide. You will also\nbe liable for transfer to any place in India as\nthe Bank may decide from time to time without\npayment of any allowance other than travelling\nallowance.\"\nIt was further submitted and it appears that there is\ngood deal of substance in this that if an All-India cadre is\nenforced in respect of Class III employees, it would result\nin injustice to all the employees in that class at the\nsmaller centres for a considerably long period of time\nleading to industrial unrest. The result of applying the\nprinciples of an All-India cadre for this class of employees\nwould be that the senior-most in that whole cadre All-India-\nwise would alone have to be considered for promotion. In\nsuch a case, for a considerable long time, only employees of\nthe older offices, namely, Bombay, Nagpur, Madras, Calcutta\nand Delhi will have to be considered, they being by far\nsenior-most among the All-India employees and such a\nconsideration and empanelling would continue for a very long\ntime as the principal basis of the settlement was not one of\npromotion on merit but rather an upgradation on mere\nseniority, the only qualification being an examination to\ndetermine fitness. Once fitness was determined by the\nexamination, the ranking in that examination did not come\ninto play thereafter and the successful candidates were\nagain listed according to centre-wise seniority in the\nmatter of upgradation and promoted as and when vacancies at\nthat centre occur. It was submitted that the recruitment of\nClass III employees at the lowest grade was made centre-wise\nby the Managers of the offices concerned and not from one\nsource at the centre as such recruitment would be\nadministratively not feasible, to be undertaken.\n\nIt has to be borne in mind in deciding the controversy\nin this case that in the course of this litigation on or\nabout 20th October, 1982, this Court by an order suggested\nthe appellant Bank that it might frame a new scheme for\npromotion, removing as far as possible any imbalances that\nmight be existing in the prevailing scheme. The appellant\nBank, thereafter, made certain suggestions which were not\nacceptable to all the unions and more particularly to the\nrecognised union. In the circumstances, the Bank could not\nproceed with the suggested scheme.\n\nThereafter, the officers of the appellant Bank held\ndiscussions with the representatives of the recognised union\nviz., the All-India Reserve Bank Employees' Association, and\nfurther modified the scheme agreed to under the settlement\ndated 7th May, 1972.\nAs a result of the discussion with the employees of the\nBank, certain decisions were taken regarding the principles\ngoverning recruitment and promotion for staff officers Grade\nA. There are in the affidavit affirmed on 22nd February,\n1983 by Shri Pradeep Madhav Joshi, the Joint Chief Officer\nin the Personnel Policy Department of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia along with the letter dated 21st February, 1983.\n\nIt was stated therein that the principles governing\nrecruitment and promotion for Staff Officer Grade A evolved\nin 1972 be, subject to the approval of this Court, modified\non the following terms; \"(i) 10% of the vacancies of Staff\nOfficers Grade A. will be filled in exclusively by direct\nrecruitment. However, such of the members of the staff who\ncomply with the eligibility requirements as might be\nprescribed from time to time for direct recruitment, subject\nto relaxation in respect of age requirement as the Bank may\ndecide, will be eligible to compete in the selection test.\n\n(ii) Of the remaining 90% of the vacancies, 75% thereof will\nbe filled in on the basis of a written examination i.e.\nqualifying test in accordance with the scheme for\npromotions: Staff Officers Grade A annexed to Administrative\nCircular No.8 dated 13th many, 1972 subject to the\nconditions that no employee will be admitted to the\nqualifying test at any centre unless he has put in a minimum\nqualifying period of service of three years in clerical\ngrade as on a notified dated.\n\n(iii) The residuary portion, i.e. 35% of the 90% of the\nvacancies or in other words 22-1/2% of the total vacancies\nto the post of Staff Officers Grade A would be filled in on\nthe basis of an All-India Merit Test to be prescribed by the\nBank in consulation with the Reserve Bank of India Services\nBoard ordinarly, and employee who had put in a minimum of 9\nyears' service in Class II would be eligible to take the\ntest. If, however, sufficient number of employees with 9\nyears' service were not available at any point of time, the\nBank might suitably reduce the conditions of qualifying\nservice so that candidate to the extent of at least thrice\nthe number of vacancies are available for the test.\nNotwithstanding such reduction in qualifying service\nnecessitated in the circumstances indicated, in the case of\nnon-clerical staff who are non-graduates, they would,\nhowever, be eligible for taking the\ntest only on completion of 9 years service. Successful\ncandidates would be empanelled in the central panel in order\nof their comparative merits and they would be considered for\nposting in order of their position in the central panel as,\nwhen and where, the vacancies to posts of Staff Officer\nGrade A in any of the offices of the Bank might arise.\"\n\nThe appellant Bank addressed a letter to the\nAssociation incorporating the aforesaid decision of the\nappellant Bank on the modification of principles governing\nrecruitment and promotion for Staff Officer Grade A and the\nAssociation has, by its letter confirmed the same.\n\nIt was submitted on behalf of the Bank that the\nmodified scheme envisages appointment of a candidate for the\npost of Staff Officer Grade A through holding three\ndifferent test, viz. (i) qualifying test on the basis of\ncentre-wise seniority and estimation of vacancies of Staff\nOfficers Grade A for each centre, (ii) merit test for all\nemployees with a minimum length of service of 9 years on\nall-India basis. Successful candidates who will be\nempanelled in the central panel in order of their\ncomparative merits would be considered for posting in order\nof their position in the central panel, as, when and where\nthe vacancies to the post of Staff Officers Grade A in any\nof the offices of the Bank might arise; and (iii) Selection\ntest for direct recruitment of candidates for Staff Officer\nGrade A for inducting fresh blood for Staff Officer Grade A\nwhich is the base level of officer and first level of\nsupervisory cadre. It was submitted on behalf of the Bank\nthat the modified scheme achieved just balance keeping in\nview the interest of the employees as a class i.e. both of\nsenior and experienced employees and junior and qualified\nemployees on the one hand and the interests of the Bank on\nthe other. It was further stated that earlier, 82-1/2% of\nthe vacancies were allotted to be filled on the centre-wise\nbasis. Under the modified Scheme, the percentage was brought\ndown to 67-1/2. It was necessary to make gradual change as\nthe total change in the existing procedure would have\ncreated industrial unrest and would have led to other\nimbalances in operation.\n\nFurther it was submitted that the modified scheme\nprovided that no employee would be admitted to the\nqualifying test at any centre unless he has put in a minimum\nqualifying\nperiod of service of three years in clerical cadre as on a\nnotified date. It was submitted on behalf of the Bank that\none of the factors that influenced the High Court in the\njudgment under appeal was that raw junior employees from\nBhopal Office were eligible to appear for the qualifying\ntest, as apparent from the decision under appeal. It was\nsubmitted that with the modification, no employee who had\nput in less than three years of service would be admitted to\nthe qualifying test and the grievance that even temporary\nand junior employees would become eligible would no longer\nsurvive.\n\nThe correctness or otherwise of the decision of the\nBombay High Court in the light of the modified scheme has to\nbe judged from various angles.\n\nOn behalf of the opposing respondent, Shri C.N.\nSahasranaman made his submissions orally in person. He\nsubmitted that at pages 296 to 299, 306, 307 and 310 of the\nPaper Book, the appellant had admitted that the impugned\nscheme of promotions had led to serious imbalances in\nopportunities for appearing at the examinations. With this\nadmission, it was urged by respondents appearing in person\nthat the question of law raised by them in their affidavit\nhave been concluded by themselves and therefore they could\nnot have any grievances whatsoever against the impugned\njudgment of the Bombay High Court. It was submitted that\nmatters relating to the imbalances contained by the impugned\nCircular No.8 had already been considered at length by this\nCourt and this Court had directed on 20th October, 1982 to\nformulate a new policy removing the imbalances in the\nimpugned policy.\n\nIt was submitted by the opposing respondents that\nequality right of Class III employees which was an All-India\nInstitution would be affected even in the modified scheme\nsuggested by the Bank. It was urged that it would be\ndestructive of the All-India stature of the Reserve Bank of\nIndia.\n\nThe main grievance of the respondents was that there\nwas violation of the constitutional right and it will hamper\ndevelopment of an All-India Institution and All-India cadre.\n\nRegarding reference to the case of N.C. Paliwal, it was\nsubmitted on behalf of the opposing respondents that this\nCourt had not struck down the impugned circular on the\nground that it did not ensure equality of chances of\npromotion but on the ground that the scheme did not ensure\nequality of opportunity to be considered for promotion. The\nequality of chances of promotion and the equality to be\nconsidered for promotion, according to the respondents, are\ntwo different questions and the grievance of the respondents\nwas that there was denial of equality to be considered for\npromotion.\n\nWhether there has been denial of equality of the view\nof promotion or any constitutional right infringed or not\ncannot be judged, where interest of large number of people\nare concerned, in the abstract. Vast majority, indeed the\noverwhelming majority of the workmen are in favour of the\nscheme as evolved by the Bank as modified as it would be\napparent from the submissions urged on behalf of All-India\nReserve Bank Employees' Association impleaded as party-\nrespondent in this appeal as well as All India Reserve Bank\nEmployees' Federation, Hyderabad. It has to be borne in mind\nthat in service jurisprudence there cannot be any service\nrule which would satisfy each and every employee and its\nconstitutionality has to be judged by considering whether it\nis fair, reasonable and does justice to the majority of the\nemployees and fortunes of some individuals is not the touch-\nstone. See in this connection the observations of this Court\nin\nKamal Kanti Dutt & Ors. v. Union of India and Ors.\n,\n(supra).\n\nFurthermore it appears to us that Circular No.9 is a\ncounterpart of Circular No.8. Circular No. 8 having been\nheld valid, Circular No. 9 must also follow to be good.\nCircular No. 8 cannot stand in vacuum and in isolation. It\nis a step to the fulfilment of the object to be achieved by\nCircular No. 9. Viewed in that point of view and as a\nfeasibility and having regard to the factors and in regard\nto the history of Reserve Bank employees, we are of the\nopinion that the scheme as modified by the Bank and as\naccepted by vast majority of their employees is a proper and\njust scheme and does not suffer from the vice of\narticle 14\n\nor\narticle 16\nor any other constitutional guarantees.\n\nIt is well to bear in mind the fact that settlement of\ndisputes by direct negotiations or settlement through\ncollective bargaining is always to be preferred for it is\nbest suited for industrial peace which the aim of\nlegislation for settlement of labour disputes. See the\nobservations in\nNew Standard Engineering Co. Ltd. v. N.L.\nAbhyankar and Ors., A.I.R.\n1978 S.C. 982 at 984 = [1978] 2\nS.C.R. 798.\nThis view has again been reiterated by this\nCourt in Tata Engineering & Locomotive v. Their Workmen,\nA.I.R. 1981 S.C. 2163 = [1982] 1 S.C.R. 929. The order of\nthis Court dated 2nd May, 1984 and the referendum and the\nresult thereof have been set out hereinbefore.\n\nWe may, however, note that about the proper manner of\nholding this referendum, certain doubts were expressed at\nthe time of hearing of this appeal. The Referendum\nundoubtedly indicates that majority of the employees are in\nfavour of acceptance of the modified settlement. In matters\nof service conditions, it is difficult to evolve as ideal\nset of norms governing various conditions of services and in\ngrey area where service rules operated, if more than one\nview is possible without sacrificing either reasons or\ncommon-sense, the ultimate choice has necessarily to be\nconditioned by several considerations ensuring justice to as\nmany as possible and injustice to as few. See in this\nconnection the observations in\nK.K. Dutta v. Union of India\n\n(supra) at page 841. These principles, however significant,\ndo not authorise the majority of the employees to trample\nupon the constitutional guarantees or rights of the\nindividual or minority employees. Majority cannot thwart or\nbarter away the constitutional rights of the minorities. The\nconstitutional guarantees are to protect this very danger.\nBut in judging the content of the constitutional rights, the\nentire perspective of the equality of opportunity here and\ndenial of equal right in public employment have to be viewed\nin a fair, reasonable and just perspective. Viewed in that\nlight, it is true, there may be individual instances\nexemplifying injustice by postponing or delaying the chances\nof promotions of the contesting respondents yet that does\nnot deny them their constitutional right in its proper\nmeasure, and the considerations that have weighed with the\nmaking of the modified scheme and in the light of the other\nconsiderations mentioned hereinbefore, we must observe that\nwith whatever care and objectivity or foresight any rule is\nframed, some hardship, inconvenience or injustice might to\nresult but the\nparamount consideration is the reconciliation of the\nconflicting claims of two important constituents of service\none which brings fresh clerical employees and the other\nmature experience. There has been a happy merger of these\ntwo considerations in the scheme proposed and in that\nmerger, no violation of the guaranteed rights of the\nopposing respondents have occurred.\n\nIt has further to be borne in mind that the promotion\nscheme having been evolved after careful consideration and\nhaving been in operation ever since the inception of the\nBank with modification from time to time as a result of the\nnegotiations under the\nIndustrial Disputes Act\nshould not be\nmodified drastically. In such matters one should hasten\nslowly.\n\nIn the premises we affirm the scheme as modified by the\nsecond modification referred to hereinbefore in the letter\ndated 21st February, 1983 and as explained in the affidavit\nof Pradeep Madhav Joshi filed on 22nd February,- 1983. We\nfurther direct that the adhoc promotions made under the\ndirections of this Court in terms of the Order dated 22nd\nMay, 1984 be regularised. The opposing respondents have\nappeared in person and have made submissions. They have made\nvaluable contributions. The constitutionality of a scheme or\nif there is a violation of a right can only be decided if it\nis questioned.\n\nIn that view of the matter the opposing respondents\nshould be amply compensated. We award cost of Rs. 5000\njointly to them or if they are appearing singly then singly.\nAmounts already paid by the Bank should be adjusted against\nthe amount to be paid. If more amounts than Rs. 5000 have\nalready been paid then nothing need be refunded or paid. The\ndecision of the Bombay High Court is set aside. The appeal\nis allowed and the order of the Bombay High Court\nsubstituted by the order mentioned hereinbefore.\n\nCivil Misc. Petition No. 14834 of 1985 - application\nfor intervention and Civil Misc. Petition No. 14822 of 1985\napplication for impleading are allowed and are disposed of\nalong with the above order.\n\nS.R. Appeal allowed.",
