Appellants\n\nVs.\n\nJharkhand Gramin Bank & Ors. ... Respondents\n\nWITH\n\nCA Nos.1787-1788 & 1789 of 2002\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nR.V.RAVEENDRAN, J.\n\nThe appellants in these appeals are the employees of\n\nthe first respondent-Bank - Ranchi Kshetriya Gramin Bank\n\n- now known as Jharkhand Gramin Bank. The appellants were\n\nworking as clerks-cum-cashiers or equivalent posts in\n\ndifferent branches of the first respondent-Bank. The\n\nRegional Rural Banks (Appointment and Promotion of\n\nOfficers and other Employees) Rules, 1988 (for short `the\n\nRules') made by the Central Government in exercise of\n\npowers conferred under the Provincial Rural Banks Act,\n1976 governed the appointment and promotion of employees\n\nof the Bank. Rule 5 provided that all vacancies shall be\n\nfilled in accordance with the provisions of the Second\n\nSchedule to the Rules. Entry (5) of Second Schedule to\n\nthe Rules related to filling of posts of Field\n\nSupervisors (subsequently merged with the post of\n\nofficers). Clause (a) thereof provided that 50% of the\n\nposts shall be filled by promotion from amongst the\n\nconfirmed senior and junior clerks-cum-cashiers or\n\nclerks-cum-typists or stenographers or steno-typists on\n\nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit (the remaining 50% to be\n\nfilled by direct recruitment which is not relevant for\n\nthese appeals). Clause (b) of Entry (5) prescribed the\n\neducational qualifications and the eligibility (minimum\n\nnumber of years of service in the feeder post) for\n\npromotion. Clause (e) of Entry (5) prescribed the mode of\n\nselection for promotion as \"interviews and assessment of\n\nperformance reports for preceding three years period\".\n\n2. The first respondent Bank drew up a common seniority\n\nlist of all the eligible candidates (candidates\n\npossessing the prescribed educational qualifications who\n\nhave put in the prescribed period of service) from the\n\nfeeder grades. Then the eligible candidates were\n\nsubjected to a comparative assessment based on marks\n\nsecured with reference to four parameters adopted by the\nBoard of Directors of the first respondent-Bank at its\n\n58th Meeting, on the basis of the norms prescribed by the\n\nNational Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (for\n\nshort `NABARD'). The four parameters and maximum marks\n\nallocated to each of them were as under:\n\nSl.N Particulars Maximum\no. Marks\n\n(i) Seniority 40\n\n(one mark for each completed quarter of\nservice)\n\n(ii) Educational Qualifications : 6\n\n[for possessing graduate degree : 3 marks;\npost-graduate degree : 2 marks and\nDoctorate : 1 mark]\n\n(iii Performance-appraisal : 24\n\n) [for Very Good (A) - 8 marks; for Good (B)\n\n- 6 marks; for Average (C) - 5 marks; and\nfor Poor (D) - 0 marks]\n\n(iv) Interview : 30\n\n[Minimum qualifying marks for interview :\n\n10 marks]\n\nTOTAL 100\n\nA list of the candidates who secured the minimum\n\nqualifying marks in the interview was prepared in the\n\norder of merit with reference to the marks secured by\n\nthem on such assessment. Therefore, 31 candidates were\n\npromoted from among the said list of clerical cadre to\nthe post of Field Supervisors in the order of merit, vide\n\nnotification dated 20.11.1990.\n\n3. Feeling aggrieved, the third respondent herein filed\n\na writ petition before the High Court, contending that in\n\nmaking the promotions, the Bank had ignored the principle\n\nof seniority-cum-merit prescribed under the Rules and had\n\nfollowed the principle of merit-cum-seniority. It was\n\nalso contended that contrary to the provisions of the\n\nRules which required that the mode of selection would be\n\nonly by interviews and assessment of performance reports\n\nfor preceding three years, the Bank had adopted the\n\nmethod of assessment with reference to four parameters,\n\nthat is, years of service (seniority), educational\n\nqualifications, in addition to performance appraisal and\n\ninterview.\n\n4. By the time the said writ petition came up for\n\nconsideration, a Full Bench of the Patna High Court had\n\nrendered its judgment in\nRanchi Kshetriya Gramin Bank vs.\n\nD.P. Singh\n[2000 (1) PLJR 251], holding that promotion of\n\npersons with reference to merit, that is, promoting those\n\nwho secured highest marks in the list of eligible\n\ncandidates was contrary to the principle of seniority-\n\ncum-merit. A learned Single Judge of the High Court,\n\ntherefore, allowed the writ petition field by third\nrespondent, by order dated 10.1.2001 and set aside the\n\npromotions. He held that the promotions effected as per\n\nthe order dated 20.11.1990 without following the\n\nprinciple of seniority-cum-merit, but on a comparative\n\nassessment of merit which was based on marks for academic\n\nqualifications, interview etc. were illegal.\n\nConsequently, he directed as follows :\n\n\"While considering the cases all the eligible\ncandidates, it shall be open to the respondent\nto fix marks for assessment of performance of\nproceeding three years prior to the date such\npromotion as were considered originally. This\nclearly means the three proceeding years from\nthe date of original consideration which was\nthe subject matter of the writ application. It\nshall be open to the Bank to allocate marks at\nthe minimum level for the interview/viva voce\ntest in addition to assessment of performance,\nto determine the standard of candidate in the\ninterest of administration. Once it is done,\nseniority shall have precedence over\neverything else.\n\nx x x x x\n\nTill order of promotion is issued based on the\naforesaid directions the respondents No.3 to 7\nand the intervener(s) will continue to hold\nthe post(s) as presently held by them and not\nto be disturbed till the final order(s) are\npassed in the matter of promotion. If,\nhowever, any contesting respondent(s) or\nintervener(s) or one or other fail to get\npromotion they shall be deemed to be reverted\nto the post as originally held by them before\nissuance of the impugned order of promotion,\nwhich has been set aside.\n\nIt is also made clear that contesting\nrespondents no.3 to 7 or the interveners if\nallowed promotion on such consideration, they\nwill not get benefit in pursuance of earlier\nnotification dated 19th Nov. 1990, which has\nbeen set aside by this Court.\"\n\nThe appeals filed by the appellants (candidates promoted\n\non 20.11.1990) against\nthe said judgment\nwere dismissed\n\nby the Division Bench, holding by a short order that the\n\njudgment of the learned Single Judge did not call for\n\ninterference. The said judgment is challenged in these\n\nappeals by special leave.\n\n5. The first contention urged by the appellants is that\n\nthe promotions made on dated 20.11.1990 were lawful and\n\nvalid. It was submitted that the Bank had effected\n\npromotions by giving primacy to seniority as it allotted\n\nmaximum marks of 40 out of 100, for the period of service\n\n(at the rate of one mark for every quarter of service).\n\nIt was pointed out that marks allotted to other\n\nparameters were less - 30 marks for interview, 24 marks\n\nfor performance-appraisal in regard to three years\n\nservice and 6 marks for educational qualifications. It\n\nwas contended that when primacy was accorded to seniority\n\n(period of service) in the assessment process, the\n\npromotion should be treated as on the principle of\n\nseniority-cum-merit.\n6. The principle of seniority-cum-merit is well-\n\nsettled.\nIn\nRajendra Kumar Srivastava & Ors. v. Samyut\n\nKshetriya Gramin Bank & Ors. [C.A. No.6691\nof 2001\n\ndecided on 17.11.2009], this Court observed as follows :\n\n\"8. It is also well settled that the principle\nof seniority-cum-merit, for promotion, is\ndifferent from the principle of `seniority'\nand principle of `merit-cum-seniority'. Where\npromotion is on the basis of seniority alone,\nmerit will not play any part at all. But where\npromotion is on the principle of seniority-\ncum-merit, promotion is not automatic with\nreference to seniority alone. Merit will also\nplay a significant role. The standard method\nof seniority-cum-merit is to subject all the\neligible candidates in the feeder grade\n(possessing the prescribed educational\nqualification and period of service) to a\nprocess of assessment of a specified minimum\nnecessary merit and then promote the\ncandidates who are found to possess the\nminimum necessary merit strictly in the order\nof seniority. The minimum merit necessary for\nthe post may be assessed either by subjecting\nthe candidates to a written examination or an\ninterview or by assessment of their work\nperformance during the previous years, or by a\ncombination of either two or all the three of\nthe aforesaid methods. There is no hard and\nfast rule as to how the minimum merit is to be\nascertained. So long as the ultimate\npromotions are based on seniority, any process\nfor ascertaining the minimum necessary merit,\nas a basic requirement, will not militate\nagainst the principle of seniority-cum-merit.\n\nx x x x x\n\n10. Thus it is clear that a process whereby\neligible candidates possessing the minimum\nnecessary merit in the feeder posts is first\nascertained and thereafter, promotions are\nmade strictly in accordance with seniority,\nfrom among those who possess the minimum\nnecessary merit is recognised and accepted as\ncomplying with the principle of `seniority-\ncum-merit'. What would offend the rule of\nseniority-cum-merit is a process where after\nassessing the minimum necessary merit,\npromotions are made on the basis of merit\n(instead of seniority) from among the\ncandidates possessing the minimum necessary\nmerit. If the criteria adopted for assessment\nof minimum necessary merit is bona fide and\nnot unreasonable, it is not open to challenge,\nas being opposed to the principle of\nseniority-cum-merit. We accordingly hold that\nprescribing minimum qualifying marks to\nascertain the minimum merit necessary for\ndischarging the functions of the higher post,\nis not violative of the concept of promotion\nby seniority-cum-merit.\"\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n7. In this case, the bank did not subject the eligible\n\ncandidates to any process of assessment to ascertain any\n\nspecified minimum merit, for the purpose of promoting the\n\ncandidates who possessed the minimum merit, on the basis\n\nseniority. On the other hand, the Bank proceeded to\n\nassess their inter-se-merit with reference to four\n\ncriteria (period of service, educational qualification,\n\nperformance during three years, and interview) by\n\nallocating respectively maximum marks of 40, 6, 24 and 30\n\n(out of a total 100 marks) and then proceeded to promote\n\nthose who had secured the highest marks in the order of\n\nmerit. Thus there were two violations of the relevant\n\nrules: (i) promoting candidates on merit-cum-seniority\n\nand not on seniority-cum-merit; and (ii) assessing inter-\n\nse merit, inter alia with reference to marks allocated to\ndifferent educational qualifications. It cannot,\n\ntherefore, be said that the promotions made on 20.11.1990\n\nwere on the basis of seniority-cum-merit. Though the\n\nperiod of service was also considered as one of the\n\nfactors for assessment of comparative merit, the\n\nprocedure adopted for promotion was merit-cum-seniority.\n\nThe High Court was, therefore, justified in interfering\n\nwith the promotions. The directions given by the High\n\nCourt for fresh process of promotion were in consonance\n\nwith the Rules and principles of seniority-cum-merit. The\n\nappeals, therefore, have no merit.\n\n8. The appellants submitted that they were promoted in\n\nNovember 1990, that they had worked in the higher post of\n\nField Superiors for more than ten years and therefore,\n\neven if there was some procedural irregularity, their\n\npromotions ought not to have been interfered with, in the\n\nyear 2001. The submission is misleading. Though the\n\npromotions of appellants were in November, 1990, it was\n\nchallenged before the High Court by the third respondent\n\nby filing a writ petition, without any delay, that is, in\n\nless than three months. The fact that the writ petition\n\nwas pending for a considerable time will not therefore\n\ncreate any equities in favour of the appellants.\n9. The appellants in C.A. No.1789 of 2002 have an\n\nadditional grievance. The three appellants in that appeal\n\nwere originally promoted on 20.11.1990. When the High\n\nCourt set aside the said promotions and directed a fresh\n\nprocess of promotions by adopting the principle of\n\nseniority-cum-merit, the Bank accordingly made fresh\n\npromotions by order dated 24.4.2001 and these three\n\nappellants were again promoted with effect from 9.4.2001.\n\nBut their seniority in the post of Field Supervisor was\n\nreckoned from the date of their fresh promotion i.e.\n\n9.4.2001 and the previous period of service as Field\n\nSupervisor from 1990 to 2001 was ignored. They contend\n\nthat their service as Field Supervisors between 1990 and\n\n2001 should also be counted for the purpose of their\n\nseniority in the post of Field Supervisors, further\n\npromotions and other benefits.\n\n10. It is now well-settled that if an appointment or\n\npromotion is made without considering the claims of all\n\nthe available eligible candidates and/or without\n\nfollowing the relevant rules, the service rendered in\n\npursuance of such illegal appointment or promotion cannot\n\nbe equated to service rendered in pursuance of an\n\nappointment or promotion validly and lawfully made.\n\nWhenever a person is promoted to a post without following\nthe rules prescribed for such promotion, he should be\n\ntreated as a person not regularly promoted to that post.\n\nConsequently, where promotions are governed by Rules, in\n\ncomputing the length of service, in the post to which an\n\nemployee is promoted, it is not permissible to include\n\nthe period of service rendered in pursuance of an illegal\n\npromotion which is subsequently set aside. It,\n\ntherefore, follows that the period of service rendered by\n\nthe appellants from 1990 to 2001 cannot be counted for\n\nthe purpose of seniority in the cadre of Officers/Field\n\nSuperiors. Therefore, the appellants in C.A. No.1789/2002\n\nare also not entitled to any relief.\n\n11. Therefore, all the appeals and the applications for\n\nimpleadment are dismissed.\n\n..............................J.\n(R. V.
