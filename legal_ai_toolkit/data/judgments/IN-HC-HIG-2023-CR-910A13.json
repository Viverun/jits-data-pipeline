Applicant\nThrough: Mr. Rohit Singh, Mr. Sujit Kumar,\nMr. Prince Kumar and Mr. Vikram\nSingh, Advocates.\n\nVersus\n\nSTATE OF NCT OF DELHI ..... Respondent\nThrough: Mr. Ajay Vikram Singh, APP for\nState with Insp. G. R. Meena, PS\nSwaroop Nagar.\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SAURABH BANERJEE\nORDER\n\n% 21.12.2023\n\n1. The applicant, vide the present application under\nSection 439\nof the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [\nCrPC\n] seeks regular bail in FIR\nNo.0043/2018 dated 01.02.2018 registered under Section(s) 498A/304B/\n34 of the\nIndian Penal Code\n, 1860 [\nIPC\n] at PS.: Swaroop Nagar, North\nWest District, Delhi.\n\n2. As per FIR, the deceased person namely Babita and the applicant\ngot married on 08.12.2016. Sometime in the evening of 31.01.2018, the\nparents of the deceased person were informed by the parents of the\napplicant that the deceased person had committed suicide by hanging\nherself from the ceiling fan. Thereafter, on the statement of the mother of\nthe deceased person, the present FIR came to be registered on the very\nnext day and the applicant was arrested on 01.02.2018.\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 1 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\n\n3. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has\nbeen falsely implicated in the present FIR; and that the testimonies of the\nparents of the deceased person have already been recorded, which reflect\nthat the applicant was not at all involved in the death of the deceased\nperson and further that their statements recorded before the SDM as well\nas before the learned Trial Court reflect only vague allegations as regards\ndemand of dowry and cruelty meted out to the deceased person; and that\nthere is no suicide note or any other documentary evidence other than the\nuncorroborated testimony of the mother of the deceased person; and that\nthere is no proximate link with the cruelty, if any, meted out to the\ndeceased person, as such, the offence under\nSection 304B\nof the IPC is not\nmade out against the applicant; and that the applicant satisfies the triple\ntest for grant of bail; and that as per the SDM Report, the applicant was\nnot even present at the place of the incident and lastly that since at least 12\nout of the 15 witnesses have already been examined before the learned\nTrial Court and since the trial is likely to take a considerable time to\nconclude, therefore, in the interest of justice, the applicant ought to be\nreleased on bail.\n\n4. This Court, vide its order dated 22.11.2021, issued Notice and\ncalled for the Status Report. Additionally, Nominal Roll was also\nrequisitioned from the concerned Jail Superintendant. Further, vide order\ndated 27.04.2023, the latest Nominal Roll was requisitioned from the\nconcerned Jail Superintendant.\n\n5. Learned APP for the State, while opposing grant of bail submits that\nthe offence(s) as alleged in the FIR are serious in nature; and that the time\ngap between the date of marriage and the date of death of the deceased\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 2 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\nperson is just over a year and the same raises a serious suspicion upon the\nrole of the applicant; and that the complainant in her statement before the\nSDM had raised the allegations as regards demand of dowry and cruelty\nmeted out to the deceased person; and that the parents of the deceased\nperson have supported the case of the prosecution; and lastly that since\nthere are only 2 more formal witnesses left to be examined, therefore, the\ntrial is likely to conclude soon, as such, the applicant, ought not to be\ngranted bail in the present application.\n\n6. As per Nominal Roll, as on 26.05.2023, the applicant has been in\njudicial custody for a total period of 2 years, 9 months and 5 days. Further,\nthe overall jail conduct of the applicant has been „Satisfactory‟.\n\n7. This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties and also\nperused the documents on record.\n\n8. An offence under\nSection 304B\nof the IPC, involved in the present\nproceedings, has to have the basic ingredients as laid out therein. Firstly, it\nis presupposed that \"cruelty\" has been meted out to the deceased person.\nSecondly, the said cruelty is to be coupled with a \"demand of dowry\". In\nessence thereof, any demand of dowry has to be the reason for such\ncruelty. Thus, for drawing any such presumption under\nSection 304B\nIPC,\nit is necessary that the deceased person was subjected to such cruelty or\nharassment in connection with any demand of dowry soon prior to his/ her\ndeath.\n\n9. In the present proceedings, there are no allegations of that kind.\nThus, there are no elements regarding demand of dowry by the applicant\nduring the time period when he was married to the deceased person. There\nwas never anything, much less any formal complaint, made as regards to\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 3 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\nany cruelty or demand of dowry at any point of time during the time\nperiod when the deceased person was married to the applicant and was\nindeed residing with him. The same holds much significance while this\nCourt is considering grant of bail to the applicant.\n\n10. Furthermore, it is also a matter of fact that the present is not a case\ninvolving a suicide note.\n\n11. In the present proceedings, the applicant has already been behind\nbars for a period of almost 3 years and since the trial is likely to take some\ntime to conclude, therefore, it shall be in the interest of justice, if the\napplicant is released on bail.\n\n12. No doubt, though the applicant has been named in the FIR as an\naccused, however, till the final outcome of the proceedings emanating\ntherefrom, the status of the applicant is merely that of a suspect. The\napplicant is innocent till proven guilty. As such, keeping the applicant\nlanguishing behind bars during such time, would serve no fruitful purpose.\nAlso, the same shall be a violation of\nArticle 21\nof The Constitution of\nIndia [Re.:\nHussainara Khatoon & Ors vs Home Secretary, State Of\nBihar\n(1980) 1 SCC 81;\nSatender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of\nInvestigation\n(2022) 10 SCC 51].\n\n13. Thus, considering the aforesaid factual scenario coupled with the\nlegal position at hand, in the interest of justice, this is a fit case to release\nthe applicant on bail.\n\n14. Accordingly, the applicant is released on bail in FIR No.0043/2018\ndated 01.02.2018 registered under Section(s) 498A/304B/34 of the\nIPC\nat\nPS.: Swaroop Nagar, North West District, Delhi, subject to him furnishing\na personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand Only)\n\nBAIL APPLN. 4106/2021 Page 4 of 6\n\nThis is a digitally signed order.\n\nThe authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.\nThe Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 26/12/2023 at 21:32:15\nalong with one surety of the like amount by a family member/ friend\nhaving no criminal case pending against them and subject to the\nsatisfaction of the learned Trial Court, and further subject to the following\nconditions:\n\ni.
