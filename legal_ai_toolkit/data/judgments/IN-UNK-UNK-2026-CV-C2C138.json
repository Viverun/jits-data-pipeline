Consequent upon the\namendment caused to the said rules on July 17, 1987, they\nfelt that the amendment had affected their further\npromotional chances. They therefore filed writ petitions\nbefore the High court challenging the vires of the\namendment dated 17.7.1987 contending that the creation of\nSuper time scale did not have the automatic effect of\ncreating highest post/posts to be filled by merit alone,\nand that the posts to which Super Time Scale was attracted\nremained `higher posts' in contrast to `highest posts'\navailable to the members of the Rajasthan Administrative\nService on the prescribed percentage of 50 per cent on merit\nand the remaining fifty per cent on seniority-cum-merit.\nTheir case was that section to the highest posts made under\nthe amended rule solely on the basis of the merit was bad in\nlaw. Before the High Court challenge to the vires of the\namendment was abandoned and the High Court considered the\nquestion (i) whether the Super time scale is/are the highest\npost/posts in the service and\n (ii) if it is so, whether the post/posts is/are to be\n filled on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\n proportion of 50:50 or on merit alone in accordance with\n sub-rule (7) of /Rule 28-B of the Rules:\n The High Court rejected the writ petitions opening that\nthe Super Time Scale post/posts was/were the highest\npost/posts in the service and those are required to be\nfilled on merit alone and not in the proportion of 50:50 on\nthe basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit. Hence these\nappeals by the appellants.\n Dismissing the appeals this Court\n HELD: The terms `higher post' and `highest post'\noccurring in\n 580\nRules 28-B and 32 by all means are relative ones expected to\nbe created in singular or plural terms under rule 6\nwhereunder the strength of posts in each grade was\ndeterminable by the government from time to time. Sub-rule\n(7) even before the amendment of 17.7.1987 postulated a\nhighest post/post capable of being filled on the basis of\nmerit alone. [590 G-H]\n Super Time Scale posts are the highest posts in the\nservice and selection for promotion and appointment on that\nbasis in the service has to be made on the basis of merit\nalone and not on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\nproportion of 50:50.[591 G]\n J.K.

No.\n4033 of 1989.\n\n Aruneshwar Gupta for the Respondents in both the\nappeals.\n\n The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\n PUNCHHI, J. The identification of the highest\npost/posts in the Rajasthan Administrative Service, capable\nof being filled by merit alone, under sub-rule (7) of 28-B\nof the Rajasthan Administrative Service Rules, 1954\n(hereafter referred to as the `Rules'), is the search\nundertaken in these two connected appeals by special leave.\n\n The respective appellants herein are Ajeet Singh\nSinghvi, who appeared in person, and Jagbir Singh who\nappeared through learned counsel. Both the appellants, at\nthe time they moved the Rajasthan High Court by means of\ntheir respective writ petitions, were high ranked officers\nin the Rajasthan Administrative Service but found their\nfurther chances to promotion obstacled on account of the\namendments caused in the said Rules with effect from July\n17, 1987. Broadly stated, on such amendments a Super Time\nscale was created which statedly was to remove stagnation in\nservice. The contention of\n\n 581\n\nthe appellants before the High Court was, and is, that the\ncreation of Super Time scale did not have the automatic\neffect of creating highest post/posts to be filled by merit\nalone, and that the posts which Super Time scale was\nattractive remained `higher posts' in contrast to `highest\npost' available to the members of the Rajasthan\nAdministrative Service on the prescribed percentage of 50\npercent on merit and the remaining fifty percent on\nseniority-cum-merit. The appellants challenged the vires of\nthe amendments dated 17-7-1987 for confining the selection\nto the highest posts made thereafter solely on the basis of\nmerit. Before the High Court, however, the question of vires\nof the amendments was given up and thus the High Court\ninvited its attention to the following two questions:\n\n (i) whether the Super Time scale is/are the highest\npost/posts in the service; and\n\n (ii) if it is so, whether that post/posts is/are to be\nfilled on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the proportion\nof 50:50 or on merit alone in accordance with sub-rule (7)\nof Rule 28-B of the Rules?\n\n The High Court by a long and an elaborate judgment,\ndated 30.4.1988 traced the history of the Rules and the\namendments made to rules 28-B and 32 from time to time\nexpressed the opinion that Super Time scale post/posts\nwas/were the highest post/posts in the service and those\nrequired to be filled on merit alone and not in the\nproportion of 50:50 on the basis of merit and seniority-cum-\nmerit. It is to challenge that view that these matters are\nhere before us and we have had the opportunity of hearing\nthe party in person and learned counsel on both sides.\n\n We begin by taking note that the word `highest' has not\nbeen given a definitive meaning in the Rules, and has to be\nunderstood and employed in the context in its ordinary\nmeaning and diction. Rule 6 prescribes the strength of the\nservice. It mandates that the strength of post in each grade\nof the service shall be such as may be determined by the\ngovernment from time to time. The proviso thereto leaves all\nthe possible flexibility with the government in the creation\nof any post of any kind and nature and for its abolition.\nThe latest notification in that regard, as was placed before\nus, is Notification No. F1(2) Karmik/ Ka-IV/79 dated January\n12, 1988 issued from the Department of Personnel and\nAdministrative Reforms, Government of Rajasthan specifying\nthat as per Rule 6 of the Service Rules, the strength of\nposts\n\n 582\n\nin each grade of Rajasthan Administrative Service is\ndetermined therein. The said notification is found in a\ncompilation prepared by the Rajasthan Administrative Service\nAssociation, amended upto June, 19,1988. It demonstrates\nposts with their titles divided into seven categories. The\nfirst category is of Super Time Scale posts in the grade of\nRs. 3900-125-4400-150-5300. The second category is of\nselection scale post in the grade of 2978-75-3050-100-3650-\n125-4400-150-4700. Thereafter there are lesser pay-scale\ngiven in the third category of senior scale posts and in the\nfourth category, junior scale posts followed by special ex-\ncadre posts, training reserve and leave reserve posts. The\nSuper Time Scale posts are 25 in number and those posts are\nnamed and numbered as follows:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nS. NO. Name of the Post No. of Posts\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Director of Agriculture Marketing & Ex- 1\n Officio Dy. Secy. to Govt.\n\n2. Director, Local Bodies 1\n\n3. Commissioner, Devasthan Deptt. 1\n\n4. Revenue Appellate Authority 10\n\n5. Principal, A.P.R.T.S., TONK 1\n\n6. Addl. Divisional Commissioners 6\n\n7. Addl. Director, HCM RIPA, Udaipur 1\n\n8. Addl. Commissioner, Co,. Cum-R. A. A., Bikaner1\n\n9. Addl. Commissioner, TAD 1\n\n10. Addl. Commissioner, Desert Dav. 1\n\n11. Addl. Commissioner, Transport 1\n\n -----\n\n 25\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Now whether these posts are the highest posts in the\nRajasthan Administrative Service or are just higher posts,\nso as to identify the criteria applicable for promoting to\nthese posts their personnel.\n\n `Service' has been defined in Rule 4-L to mean the\nRajasthan Administrative Service. Sub-rule (7) of Rule 28-B\nprescribes that\n\n 583\n\nselection for promotion to the highest post/posts in the\nState Service shall always be made on the basis of merit\nalone. As said before, `highest posts' has nowhere been\ndefined. Prior to the amendment of July 17, 1987, sub-rule\n(7) read as follows:\n\n \"Selection for promotion to the highest post or highest\ncategory of posts in the State Service shall always be made\non the basis of merit alone.\"\n\n According to the appellants, prior to July 17, 1987 the\nhighest post was never identified and equally the highest\ncategory of posts were nowhere visible. The posts now\nfalling in the Super Time Scale, tabulation of which stands\nincorporated above, were always considered as higher posts\nand in terms of sub-rule (6) of rule 28-B,Selection for\npromotion to all other higher posts/higher category of posts\nin the State Service were required to be made on the basis\nof merit and seniority-cum-merit in the proportion of 50:50.\nThe proviso, however, to sub-rule (6) provided that if the\nCommittee (appointed under Rule 28) was satisfied that\nsuitable persons are not available for selection by\npromotion strictly on the basis of merit in a particular\nyear, selection by promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\nmerit may be made in the same manner as specified in these\nRules. The two appellants maintained that before the\nintroduction of the Super Time scale vide amendment dated\nJuly 17, 1987 there were only three categories, namely,\nordinary scale posts (alternatively known as junior scale),\nsenior scale posts and selection scale posts in the Service\nand these continued as such despite the amendments. Before\nthe High Court the exercise to identify the Super Time\nselection posts would have been easy had the government\nnotification dated 12th January,1988 been brought to its\nnotice. In any event after the issuance of the Government\nnotification dated 12th January, 1988, those very posts in\nthe Service have now been designated as junior scale, senior\nscale, selection scale and super time scale posts and for\nvalid administrative reason have Super Time Scale posts been\ntreated as highest posts even though they may have hitherto\nbelonged to the category of higher posts; the State Service\nremaining the same.\n\n Rule 15 prescribes eligibility for consideration for\npromotion on the basis of qualifying service for promotion.\nRule 28 prescribes the procedure for promotion and\npostulates the Constitution of a Commitee. Rule 28-B, so far\nas is relevant for our purpose, is called out below:\n\n \"28-B REVISED CRITERIA, ELIGIBILITY AND\n\n 584\n\n PROCEDURE FOR PROMOTION TO JUNIOR, SENIOR AND OTHER\n POSTS ENCADRED IN THE SERVICE-\n\n (i) As soon as the appointing authority\n determines the number of vacancies (under rule 9 of\n these Rules) and decides that a certain number of\n posts are required to be filled in by promotion, it\n shall, subject to provisions of sub-rule (9),\n prepare a correct and complete list of senior-most\n persons who are eligible and qualified under these\n Rules for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-\n\n merit or on the basis of merit to the class of\n posts concerned.\n\n (2) For appointment to the Service by\n promotion, the eligible persons included in the\n list mentioned in rule 28 shall be considered.\n\n (3) xxxxxxxxxxx\n (4) Selection for promotion in the reguler\n line of promotion from the post/posts not included\n in Service to the lowest post or category of post\n in the Service shall be made strictly on the basis\n of merit and on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in\n the proportion of 50:50.\n\n PROVIDED that if the Committee is satisfied\n that suitable persons are not available for\n selection by promotion strictly on the basis of\n merit in a particular year, selection by promotion\n on the basis of seniority-cum-merit may be made in\n the manner as specified in these Rules.\n\n (5) Subject to the provisions of sub-rule\n (7),selection for promotion from the lowest post or\n category of post in the State Service to the next\n higher post or category of post in the State\n Service and for all posts in the Subordinate\n Services and in the Ministerial Services shall be\n made strictly on the basis of seniority-cum-merit\n from amongst the persons who have passed the\n qualifying examination, if any, prescribed under\n these Rules, and have put in at least five years\n service, unless a different period is prescribed\n elsewhere in these Rules, on the first day of the\n month of April of the year of selection on the post\n or category of post from which selection is made:\n\n 585\n\n PROVIDED that in the event of non-availability\n of the persons with the requisite period of Service\n of five years, the Committee may consider the\n persons having less than the prescribed period of\n Service, if they fulfill the qualifications and\n other conditions for promotion prescribed elsewhere\n in these Rules, and are found otherwise suitable\n for promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit.\n\n (6) Selection for promotion to all other\n higher posts or higher categories of posts in the\n States Service shall be made on the basis of merit\n and on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\n proportion of 50:50.\n\n PROVIDED that if the Committee is satisfied\n that suitable persons are not available for\n selection by promotion strictly on the basis of\n merit in a particular year, selection by promotion\n on the basis of seniority-cum-merit may be made in\n the same manner as specified in these Rules.\n\n EXPLANATION: If in a Service, in any category\n of post, number of posts available for promotion is\n an odd number then for purpose of determining the\n vacancies for selection by promotion on the basis\n of seniority-cum-merit and merit in the proportion\n of 50:50, the following cyclic order shall be\n followed:\n\n The first vacancy by seniority-cum-merit; The\n subsequent vacancy by merit; The cycle to be\n repeated.\n\n (7) Selection for promotion to the highest\n post/posts in the State Service shall always be\n made on the basis of merit alone:\n\n PROVIDED that-\n\n (a) in a Service or Groups or Sections\n thereunder, where there are only two scales e.g.\n junior scale or senior scale and there is only one\n promotion then promotion shall be made on the basis\n of seniority-cum-merit alone;\n\n (b) in a Service or Groups or Section\n thereunder, where there are three scales e.g.\n junior scale, and selection scale and there are two\n promotions then promotion shall be as under:\n\n 586\n\n (i) first promotion on the basis of seniority-\n cum-merit.\n\n (ii) second promotion on the basis of\n seniority-cum-merit and merit in the proportion of\n 50:50;\n\n (c) in Services or Groups or Sections\n thereunder, where there are more than two\n promotions then first promotion shall be made on\n the basis or seniority-cum-merit alone and\n promotions to subsequent higher posts shall be made\n on the basis of seniority-cum-merit and merit in\n the proportion of 50:50 except to the highest post.\n\n PROVIDED further that if the Committee is\n satisfied that suitable persons are not available\n for selection by promotion to highest post/posts,\n strictly on the basis of merit in a particular\n year, selection by promotion to highest post/posts\n on the basis of seniority-cum-merit may be made in\n the same manner as specified in these rules.\n\n (8) The persons having been selected and\n appointed by promotion to a post or category of\n post on the basis of merit, shall be eligible for\n promotion to the next higher post or category of\n post, which is to be filled in by merit, only when\n they have put in after regular selection, at least\n five years' service, unless a higher period of\n Service is prescribed elsewhere in these Rules, on\n the first day of the month of April of the year of\n selection on the post or category of post from\n which selection is to be made:\n\n PROVIDED that the condition of five years'service\n shall not be applicable to a person, if any\n person junior to him is eligible for consideration\n for promotion on the basis of merit.\n\n PROVIDED further that in the event of non-\n availability of persons equal to the number of\n vacancies to be filled in, eligible for promotion\n in the category of post next lower from which\n promotion is made, the Committee may consider the\n persons having less than five years' service, if\n they are found otherwise suitable for promotion on\n the basis of merit alone.\n\n 587\n\n EXPLANATION: If any doubt arises about the\n categoriesation of the post as the lowest, next\n higher or highest post in the Service, the matter\n shall be referred to the Government in the\n Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n whose decision thereon shall be final.\n\n (9) The zone of consideration of persons\n eligible for promotion shall be as under:\n\n i) no. of vacancies no. of eligible\n persons to be\n considered\n\n a) for one vacancy Five eligible\n persons\n\n b) for two vacancies Eight eligible\n persons\n\n c) for three vacancies Ten eligible\n persons\n\n d) for four or more vacancies Three times the\n number of vacancies.\n\n ii) Where, the number of eligible persons for\n promotion to higher post is less than the number\n specified above, all the persons so eligible shall\n be considered.\n\n iii) Where,adequate number of candidates belonging\n to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, as\n the cases may be, are not available within the zone\n of consideration specified above, the zone of\n consideration may be extended to five times the\n number of vacancies and the candidates belonging to\n the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, as\n the case may be, (and not any other) coming within\n the extended zone of consideration shall also be\n considered against the vacancies reserved for them.\n\n iv) For the highest post in a State Service\n\n a) if promotion is from one category of post,\n eligible persons upto five in number shall be\n considered for promotion;\n\n b) if promotion is from different categories of the\n post in the same pay scale, eligible persons upto\n two in number from each category of posts in the\n same pay scale shall be considered for promotion;\n\n 588\n\n c) if promotion is from different categories of\n posts carrying different pay scales, eligible\n persons in the higher paying scale shall be\n considered for promotion first and if no suitable\n person is available for promotion on the basis of\n merit in the higher pay scale then only the\n eligible persons of other categories of posts in\n lower pay scales shall be considered for promotion\n and so on and so forth.

XXXXXX\n\n 13. XXXXXX\n\n 14. XXXXXX\n\n 15. XXXXXX\n\n 16. XXXXXX\n Rule 32 after the amendment reads as follows:\n\n \"32. APPOINTMENT TO SENIOR POST-(1) [In\n accordance with vacancies determined according to\n the provisions laid down in rule 9] appointment to\n [senior scale, selection scale and super-time\n scale] post shall be made by Government from\n amongst the members of the Service in accordance\n with the selection having been made on the basis of\n merit and seniority-cum- merit on the\n recommendations of a Committee which shall consist\n of following:\n\n 1. Chairman, Rajasthan Public Service Commission\n ...Chairman\n\n 2. Chairman, Board of Revenue ...Member\n\n 3. Secretary to Government in\n Super-time scale of the\n\n 589\n\n Indian Administrative\n Service, as may be nominated\n by the State Government ....Member\n\n 4.

For selection by seniority-\n cum-merit, the Committee shall consider the cases\n of all the persons eligible for promotion by\n examining their Confidential Rolls and Personal\n Files and interviewing such of them as they may\n deem necessary, and shall select a number of\n candidates equal to the number of vacancies likely\n to be filled by promotion by seniority-cum-merit.\n\n PROVIDED (1) that appointment to the senior or\n selection grade post [or super-time scale] post may\n be made by Government by appointing thereto\n temporarily a person eligible for appointment by\n the promotion to the Service under the provisions\n of these Rules.\n\n (2) No appointment made under [proviso (1)]\n above shall be continued beyond a period of one\n year without referring it to the Commission for\n their concurrence and shall be terminated\n immediately on their refusal to concur\".\n Argument was sought to be built that in Rule 32, Super\nTime scale was introduced with effect from 17-7-1987\nwhereunder the Government was required to make an\nappointment on the basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit on\n50:50 basis in accordance with subrule 6 of rule 28-B in the\nabsence of identification of posts. The argument looses its\nthrust in entirety when viewed on the basis of sub-rule (2)\nwhereunder the procedure and principles for selection by\nmerit\n\n 590\n\nshall, in so far it may apply, is the same as provided in\nrule 28-B. which embodies sub-rule (7) as well. We have in\nthe context to apply the Rule of harmonious construction. \nIn\n\nThe J. K. Cotton Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. v. The\nState of Uttar Pradesh & Others\n; [1961] 3 SCR 185 this Court\napplied the rule of harmonious construction even to\nsubordinate legislation and laid down as follows:\n\n \"In applying the rule however we have to remember\n that to harmonise is not to destroy. In the\n interpretation of statutes the courts always\n presume that the legislature inserted every part\n thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention\n is that every part of the statute should have\n effect. These presumption will have to be made in\n the case of rule making authority also.\"\n\n Then again in Lt. Col. Prithi Pal Singh Bedi etc. v.\nUnion of India & Others, [1983] 1 SCR 393 at pages 404-05 it\nwas observed as follows:\n\n \"The dominant purpose in construing a statute is to\n ascertain the intention of the Parliament. One of\n the well recognised canons of construction is that\n the legislature speaks its mind by use of correct\n expression and unless there is any ambiguity in the\n language of the provision the Court should adopt\n literal construction if it does not lead to an\n absurdity. The first question to the posed is\n whether there is any ambiguity in the language used\n in rule 40. If there is none, it would mean the\n language used, speaks the mind of Parliament and\n there is no need to look somewhere else discover\n the intention or meaning. If the literal\n construction leads to an absurdity, external aids\n to construction can be resorted to. To ascertain\n the literal meaning it is equally necessary first\n to ascertain the juxtaposition in which the rule is\n placed, the purpose for which it is enacted and\n the object which it is required to subserve and the\n authority by which the rule is framed. This\n necessitates examination of the broad features of\n the Act.\"\n\n On the application of above principles, it is\nnoticeable that the terms `higher post' and `highest post'\noccuring in Rules 28-B and 32 by all means are relative ones\nexpected to be created in singular or plural terms under\nRule 6 whereunder the strength of posts in each grade was\ndeterminable by the government from time to time. Sub-rule\n(7) even before the amendment of 17-7-1987 postulated a\nhighest post/posts capable of being filled on the basis of\nmerit alone. The fact\nthat they\n\n 591\n\nremained un-identified gives no basis to the plea that the\nState was incapacitated to identify at a later stage the\nhighest posts in the State Service required to be filled on\nthe basis of merit alone. It seems to us, on a close\nanalysis,and on the language employed in Rules 28-B and 32\nthat the highest post/posts conceptually were part of the\nRules but their effectuation and identification has surfaced\nonly by means of the amendments of July 17, 1987 and the\nnotification of January 12, 1988.\n\n Another significant factor which leans towards such an\ninterpretation is the stance of the State which militates\nagainst the views canvassed on behalf of the appellants.\nThere is an inbuilt safety kept in the explanation added to\nsub-rule (8) of Rule 28-B which prescribes that if any doubt\narises, amongst others, about the categorisation of the\nposts as the highest posts in the Service, the matter shall\nbe referred to the government in the Department of Personnel\nand Administrative Reforms, whose decision there on shall be\nfinal. The appellants could easily have raked up and got\nreferred the matter to the government to have a decision\nthereon. The view of the government in maintaining that the\nSuper Time scale posts are highest posts is not only a bare\nand literal interpretation given by it to the Rules but also\nis reflective of its policy in this regard and no decision\nneeds to be given by the Court in normal circumstances to\namend or alter such policy. In such a realm even\ncontemporaneous exposition of a similar rule in an other set\nof rules cannot play their part to influence either the\nCourt or the Government to give the same interpretation or\nexposition to the rules requiring interpretation herein.\nBesides the government being the author of the rule, has\nkept to itself, as a matter of prudence; the right to remove\nany ambiguity about the identification of any post including\nthe highest post/posts. The stance of the government in this\nregard should have clinched the matter but since the same\nhad been put forth as a defence in the High Court, its view\nnonetheless are entitled to great weight and the burden of\nthe appellants to lift that weight, an uphill task by all\nmeans, has remained unfulfilled.\n\n To sum up, our interpretation of the rules is in accord\nwith the interpretation of the rules as put by the High\nCourt holding that the Super Time scale posts are the\nhighest posts in the Service and selection for promotion and\nappointment on that basis in the Service has to be made on\nthe basis of merit alone and not on the basis of seniority-\ncum-merit and merit in the proportion of 50:50. In the facts\nand circumstances of the case, however, we pass no order as\nto costs, while dismissing the appeals.\n\nY.L. Appeals dismissed\n\n 592",

Consequent upon the\namendment caused to the said rules on July 17, 1987, they\nfelt that the amendment had affected their further\npromotional chances. They therefore filed writ petitions\nbefore the High court challenging the vires of the\namendment dated 17.7.1987 contending that the creation of\nSuper time scale did not have the automatic effect of\ncreating highest post/posts to be filled by merit alone,\nand that the posts to which Super Time Scale was attracted\nremained `higher posts' in contrast to `highest posts'\navailable to the members of the Rajasthan Administrative\nService on the prescribed percentage of 50 per cent on merit\nand the remaining fifty per cent on seniority-cum-merit.\nTheir case was that section to the highest posts made under\nthe amended rule solely on the basis of the merit was bad in\nlaw. Before the High Court challenge to the vires of the\namendment was abandoned and the High Court considered the\nquestion (i) whether the Super time scale is/are the highest\npost/posts in the service and\n (ii) if it is so, whether the post/posts is/are to be\n filled on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\n proportion of 50:50 or on merit alone in accordance with\n sub-rule (7) of /Rule 28-B of the Rules:\n The High Court rejected the writ petitions opening that\nthe Super Time Scale post/posts was/were the highest\npost/posts in the service and those are required to be\nfilled on merit alone and not in the proportion of 50:50 on\nthe basis of merit and seniority-cum-merit. Hence these\nappeals by the appellants.\n Dismissing the appeals this Court\n HELD: The terms `higher post' and `highest post'\noccurring in\n 580\nRules 28-B and 32 by all means are relative ones expected to\nbe created in singular or plural terms under rule 6\nwhereunder the strength of posts in each grade was\ndeterminable by the government from time to time. Sub-rule\n(7) even before the amendment of 17.7.1987 postulated a\nhighest post/post capable of being filled on the basis of\nmerit alone. [590 G-H]\n Super Time Scale posts are the highest posts in the\nservice and selection for promotion and appointment on that\nbasis in the service has to be made on the basis of merit\nalone and not on the basis of seniority-cum-merit in the\nproportion of 50:50.[591 G]\n J.K.
