This appeal, filed by the father of the deceased victim, is\n\n against the order dated 21.01.2019 passed by the Allahabad High\n\n Court, Lucknow Bench in Criminal Misc. Application No. 129789 of\n\n 2018, in Criminal Appeal No. 1594 of 2018, whereby the High Court\n\n granted bail to the Respondent No.2, Sandeep Singh Hora, husband of\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\nDigitally signed by\n\nINDU MARWAH\n\n the deceased victim, convicted by a judgment dated 23.7.2018 of\n\nDate: 2020.08.14\n\n13:25:34 IST\n\nReason:\n\n the Additional District and Sessions Judge/Special Judge (EC Act),\n\n Lucknow, hereinafter referred to as the “Sessions Court” in Sessions\n\n\f 2\n\nTrial No.1385 of 2010, for offences under \nSections 304B\n, \n498A\n and\n\n406\n of the Indian Penal Code (\nIPC\n) and \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry\n\nProhibition Act, 1961 by staying execution of the sentences of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n3. By an order dated 23.7.2018 in Sessions Trial No.1385 of 2010\n\nthe Sessions Court sentenced the Respondent No.2 to Simple\n\nImprisonment of 3 years and fine of Rs.10,000/- under \nSection 498A\n\nof the IPC and in default of payment of fine to further Simple\n\nImprisonment of 3 months; Life Imprisonment for offence under\n\nSection 304B\n of the IPC; Simple Imprisonment for 3 years and fine of\n\nRs.5,000/- for offence under \nSection 406\n of the IPC and in default of\n\npayment of fine, further simple imprisonment of 2 months; Simple\n\nImprisonment for 5 years and fine of Rs.15,000/- under \nSection 3\n of\n\nthe Dowry Prohibition Act and in default of payment of fine, further\n\nSimple Imprisonment of 3 months and Simple Imprisonment of one\n\nyear and fine of Rs.5,000/- under \nSection 4\n of the Dowry Prohibition\n\nAct and, in default of payment of fine, further Simple Imprisonment of\n\n3 months. All the sentences were to run concurrently.\n\n4. Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the\n\nRespondent No.2 filed an appeal in the High Court which was\n\nnumbered Criminal Appeal No.9514 of 2018. After filing the appeal,\n\nthe Respondent No.2 filed Criminal Misc. Application No.129789 of\n\n2018 inter alia praying that he be enlarged on bail, during the\n\npendency of the aforesaid appeal. The said application has been\n\n\f 3\n\nallowed by the order dated 21.1.2019 under appeal.\n\n5. The High Court recorded the submission made on behalf of the\n\nRespondent No.2 that (i) No FIR in relation to demand for dowry or\n\nharassment had been filed before the death of the victim; (ii) the\n\nRespondent No.2 had taken Rs. 2,50,000/- as loan from the brother of\n\nthe victim and not as dowry, which was established because the\n\nbrother of the victim had not been produced as a witness; and (iii)\n\nthat the deceased had committed suicide which was evident from the\n\npost mortem report. The cause of death as shown in the post mortem\n\nreport was “asphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging”.\n\n6. The High Court briefly recorded the submission on behalf of the\n\nState and on behalf of the Appellant and then the submission on\n\nbehalf of the Respondent No.2, in rebuttal, that the Respondent No.2\n\nhad been framed.\n\n7. After recording the submissions of the respective parties, the\n\nHigh Court passed a short, cryptic, non speaking order, under appeal\n\nbefore this Court, which is set out hereinbelow for convenience:-\n\n “After hearing learned counsel for the parties and going\n through the record, we find force in the arguments raised by\n learned counsel for the accused-appellant. Keeping in view\n the facts and circumstances of the case, without commenting\n anything on merits of the case, we are of the considered\n opinion that accused-appellant is entitled to be released on\n bail.\n\n Let accused-appellant, namely Sandeep Singh Hora convicted\n in aforesaid Sessions Trial No. 1385 of 2010 be enlarged on bail\n during pendency of appeal subject to his furnishing a personal\n bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the\n satisfaction of court concerned.\n\n\f 4\n\n It is clarified that no stay order has been passed in respect of\n fine imposed on the accused appellant and the same shall be\n deposited within four weeks from today and in default, the\n accused-appellant shall be deprived from the benefit of the\n bail order passed today.\n\n The bail bonds after being accepted, shall be transmitted to\n this Court for being kept on record of this appeal.”\n\n8. It is not in dispute that the victim died in circumstances which\n\nwere not natural, on the night of 24/25.8.2010, within about 8½\n\nmonths of her marriage with the Respondent No.2 on 12.12.2009.\n\n9. On 25.8.2010, at about 3.05 a.m., a First Information Report\n\nNo.352/2010 was registered on the complaint of the Appellant,\n\npursuant to which, a criminal case being Crime No.480 of 2010 was\n\ninitiated against Respondent No.2, his parents and his sister Sonia @\n\nDisha Chhugani under \nSections 498A\n, \n304B\n, \n406\n and \n411\n of the IPC\n\nand \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\n10. After investigation into the case, the Investigating Officer\n\nsubmitted a chargesheet against the Respondent No.2, his father\n\nBalvir Singh, his mother Manjeet Kaur and his sister Sonia @ Disha\n\nChhugani.\n\n11. The case was committed to the Sessions Court, after which\n\ncharges were framed against the accused under \nSections 498A\n, \n304B\n\nand \n406\n of IPC and \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act, to\n\nwhich the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The accused\n\n\f 5\n\nwere absolved of the charge under \nSection 411\n of the IPC.\n\n12. In Sessions Trial No.1385 of 2010, the Prosecution examined\n\neight witnesses, including the Appellant, being the complainant in the\n\nFIR, his wife, being the mother of the victim and his sister Rajendra\n\nPal Kaur, being the paternal aunt of the victim. The defence also\n\nexamined five witnesses. The Respondent No.2 and the other accused\n\nwere examined under \nSection 313\n of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\n(\nCrPC\n).\n\n13. The evidence adduced before the Sessions Court, has\n\nmeticulously been recorded in the judgment and order dated\n\n23.7.2018, under appeal before the High Court. The family members\n\nof the victim, who deposed before the Sessions Court, have given oral\n\nevidence that the Appellant had spent money beyond his financial\n\ncapacity, for the wedding of his daughter, that is, the victim.\n\nHowever, soon after the marriage of the victim to the Respondent\n\nNo.2 on 12.12.2009, the victim’s in-laws as well as the Respondent\n\nNo.2, her husband, harassed her mentally and physically for more\n\ndowry.\n\n14. From the oral evidence of the victim’s parents, and other family\n\nmembers, it transpires that the victim used to make phone calls to\n\nher mother, maternal grandmother and her aunt, complaining of\n\nharassment meted out to her by the members of her matrimonial\n\nfamily. There is oral evidence that the Appellant’s wife used to\n\nconsole her by saying that things would settle down in due course.\n\n\f 6\n\n15. From the oral evidence it also transpires that the in-laws of the\n\nvictim used to pressurize the victim to bring cash from her parents.\n\nOn 17.6.2010, the Respondent No.2 along with his father Balvir Singh\n\ncame to Sitapur and took cash of Rs.2,50,000/- from the victim’s\n\nbrother, Pritam Singh. From the oral evidence of the Appellant, it\n\ntranspires that on the evening of 24.8.2010, the victim rang up the\n\nAppellant twice, complaining of atrocities. She was frightened and\n\nexpressed fear for her life. On the same night at 12.15 a.m. the\n\nAppellant was informed that his daughter had died.\n\n16. The 2nd Prosecution Witness, being the mother of the victim,\n\nstated that the family had spent approximately Rs.21 lacs for the\n\nmarriage of the victim. They had gifted I-10 car, which they had\n\npurchased, after obtaining loan against insurance policy. However,\n\nafter marriage, the in-laws of the victim started harassing the victim,\n\ndemanding cash of Rs.15 to 20 lacs, alleged to have been promised\n\nby her parents and also demanding a Pajero car in place of the I-10\n\ncar.\n\n17. The post mortem report reveals the following ante-mortem\n\ninjuries:-\n\n “Oblique ligature mark 30 cm x 1.5 cm on front and around the\n neck just above thyroid cartilage; both lungs and membranes\n congested; right heart chamber full and left empty; there was\n some semi-digested food material available in stomach; liver,\n spleen, both kidneys congested; uterus empty and normal; the\n death had possibly taken place half day before post-mortem.\n As per the opinion of the witness, the deceased had died due\n to asphyxia as a result of ante mortem hanging.”\n\n\f 7\n\n18. The Respondent No. 2 and his parents were examined under\n\nSection 313\n of the Cr.PC. They denied practically everything, except\n\nthe fact that the Respondent No.2 had married the victim on\n\n12.12.2009. They emphasized on the fact that the victim had\n\ncommitted suicide, and contended that the entire investigation had\n\nbeen conducted under the supervision and instructions of a motivated\n\nIPS officer, who was a friend of the Appellant.\n\n19. The Respondent No.2 and/or his parents have, in their\n\nexamination under \nSection 313\n of the CrPC, suggested that the\n\ndeceased victim had wanted to marry some other boy, but had been\n\ncompelled by her parents to marry the Respondent No.2 and that she\n\nfrequently used to talk with and exchange messages with that boy.\n\nThere is also a suggestion that the victim had committed suicide\n\nbecause of mental illness. Significantly, on the one hand it is\n\ninsinuated that her involvement with another boy led to the suicide\n\nand on the other hand it is suggested that she committed suicide due\n\nto mental illness. The suggestions are somewhat contradictory and in\n\nany case the suggestion of mental illness is unsupported by any\n\nevidence whatsoever.\n\n20. Through three of the witnesses examined by the defence,\n\nnamely, one Shri K.K. Pandey, Sub-Divisional Engineer, Mobile\n\nServices (Security) who deposed as the 1st Defence Witness, Shri\n\nMadhu Balusu, Nodal Officer, Reliance Communications, Gomti Nagar,\n\nLucknow who deposed as 2nd Defence Witness, and Shri Prashant\n\nMishra who deposed as 3rd Defence Witness, the defence made an\n\n\f 8\n\nattempt to establish the victim’s involvement with the said Prashant\n\nMishra. The evidence of the aforesaid three witnesses evinces calls\n\nfrom the victim’s phone to the phone in the name of Prashant Mishra,\n\nand from the said phone to the phone of the victim and also exchange\n\nof some messages between the two phones. However, the said\n\nPrashant Mishra, who deposed as Defence witness said, that the\n\nphone in his name was always kept at home and used by his parents\n\nand sister. The victim was a class friend of his sister, Prachi. He did\n\nnot know the mobile number of the victim. The victim used to talk to\n\nhis sister Prachi. This witness deposed that he knew that the victim\n\nhad married the Respondent No.2. He said that his sister Prachi and\n\nhis mother had attended the wedding. This witness categorically\n\nasserted that phone calls to and from the victim from this phone\n\nnumber were not made in his presence, nor were the messages\n\nexchanged in his presence.\n\n21. The 4th Defence Witness, Smt. Lajwanti Chugani (mother-in-law\n\nof Sonia @ Disha Chhugani) and the 5th Defence Witness Shri\n\nBhagwan Das Chugani (father-in-law of Sonia alias Disha Chhugani)\n\ndeposed that their daughter in law Sonia did not have good relations\n\nwith her parents as she had left her first husband and remarried their\n\nson against the wishes of her parents.\n\n22. The Sessions Court considered the evidence adduced on behalf\n\nof the Prosecution, including the oral evidence of the family members\n\nof the victim, the evidence of the defence witnesses and the defence\n\nof the Respondent No.2, his parents and his sister under \nSection 313\n\n \n9\n\nof the CrPC and thereafter convicted the Respondent No.2 as also his\n\nparents Balvir Singh and Manjeet Kaur under \nSections 498A\n, \n304B\n\nand \n406\n of the IPC and under \nSections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry\n\nProhibition Act. The Respondent No.2’s sister Sonia @ Disha\n\nChugani was acquitted of all the charges against her.\n\n23. The judgment and order of the Sessions Court, under appeal in\n\nthe High Court is based on evidence. The oral evidence adduced\n\nbefore the Sessions Court, which has meticulously been recorded in\n\nthe judgment and order dated 23.7.2008, under appeal before the\n\nHigh Court, reveals that there is evidence of torture and harassment\n\nof the victim, by the Respondent No. 2 and his parents, for more\n\ndowry, soon after marriage, which continued till her death. The\n\nvictims husband (Respondent No. 2) and her in laws pressurized the\n\nvictim to bring cash from her parents and also pressurized her for a\n\nPajero car in place of the I-10 car gifted by her parents at the time of\n\nmarriage. The Respondent No. 2 came to Sitapur along with his\n\nfather, Balvir Singh on 17.6.2010 and took cash of Rs.2,50,000/- from\n\nthe victim’s brother, Pritam Singh. Even as late as on the evening of\n\n24.8.2010, the Respondent No.2 went to the residence of the victim’s\n\naunt and threatened to put an end to the marriage. On 24.8.2010,\n\nthe victim had made frantic calls complaining of torture, and\n\nexpressing fear for her life. From the oral evidence, it may be\n\nreasonably inferred that she was traumatized. The same night, she\n\ndied in unnatural circumstances.\n\n24. It is not for this Court to go into the merits of the appeal\n\n\f 10\n\npending before the High Court. Suffice it to mention that prima facie\n\nthe Sessions Court has proceeded on the basis of evidence and the\n\nRespondent No.2 has not been able to make out a case of any patent\n\ninfirmity and/or illegality in the judgment and order of the Sessions\n\nCourt.\n\n25. The Short question that arises for consideration in this appeal\n\nis, whether the High Court was justified in directing release of the\n\nRespondent No.2 on bail, during the pendency of his appeal before\n\nthe High Court.\n\n26. Section 389 provides that, pending any appeal by a convicted\n\nperson, the Appellate Court may, for reasons to be recorded by it in\n\nwriting, order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed\n\nagainst, be suspended and, also, if he is in confinement, that he be\n\nreleased on bail. Of course, in view of the mandate of \nSection 389(3)\n\nof the CrPC, the principles are different in the case of sentence not\n\nexceeding three years and/or in the case of bailable offences. In this\n\ncase, of course, none of the offences for which the Respondent No. 2\n\nhas been convicted are bailable. Moreover the Respondent No.2 has,\n\ninter alia, been given life imprisonment for offence under \nSection\n\n304B\n of the IPC and imprisonment for five years for offence under\n\nSection 3\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\n27. As the discretion under Section 389(1) is to be exercised\n\njudicially, the Appellate Court is obliged to consider whether any\n\ncogent ground has been disclosed, giving rise to substantial doubts\n\nabout the validity of the conviction and whether there is likelihood of\n\n\f 11\n\nunreasonable delay in disposal of the appeal, as held by this Court in\n\nKashmira Singh v. State of Punjab1\n and \nBabu Singh and Ors. v.\n\nState of U.P.2\n\n28. Section 304B was incorporated in the \nIndian Penal Code\n by the\n\nDowry Prohibition (Amendment) Act, 1986\n (Act 43 of 1986). The\n\nobject of the amendment was to curb dowry death. Section 304B\n\ndoes not categorize death, it covers every kind of death that occurs\n\notherwise than in normal circumstances. Where the other ingredients\n\nof Section 304B of the Code are satisfied, the deeming fiction of\n\nSection 304B would be attracted and the husband or the relatives\n\nshall be deemed to have caused the death of the bride.\n\n29. The essential ingredients for attraction of Section 304B are:\n\n (i) the death of woman must have been caused in\n unnatural circumstances.\n\n (ii) the death should have occurred within 7 years of\n marriage\n\n (iii) Soon before her death the woman must have been\n\n subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband\n or his relatives and such cruelty or harassment\n must be for or in connection with the demand for\n dowry, and such cruelty or harassment is shown to\n have been meted out to the woman soon before\n her death.\n\n30. As observed by this Court in \nState of Punjab v. Iqbal Singh\n\n& Ors.3\n, the legislative intent of incorporating Section 304B was to\n\ncurb the menace of dowry death with a firm hand. In dealing with\n\n1. (1977) 4 SCC 291\n\n2. (1978) 1 SCC 579\n\n3. (1991) 3 SCC 1\n\n\f 12\n\ncases under Section 304B, this legislative intent has to be kept in\n\nmind. Once there is material to show that the victim was subjected to\n\ncruelty or harassment before death, there is a presumption of dowry\n\ndeath and the onus is on the accused in-laws to show otherwise. At\n\nthe cost of repetition, it is reiterated that the death in this case took\n\nplace within 8½ months of marriage. There is apparently evidence of\n\nharassment of the victim for dowry even on the day of her death, and\n\nthere is also evidence of payment of a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to the\n\nRespondent-Accused by the victim’s brother, two months before her\n\ndeath.\n\n31. \nIn \nKalyan Chadra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan and Anr.\n 4, this\n\nCourt held:-\n\n “11. The law in regard to grant or refusal of bail is very well\n settled. The Court granting bail should exercise its\n discretion in a judicious manner and not as a matter of\n course. Though at the stage of granting bail a detailed\n examination of evidence and elaborate documentation of\n the merits of the case need not be undertaken, there is a\n need to indicate in such orders reasons for prima facie\n concluding why bail was being granted particularly where\n the accused is charged of having committed a serious\n offence. Any order devoid of such reasons would suffer from\n non-application of mind.”\n\n32. Even though detailed examination of the merits of the case may\n\nnot be required by courts while considering an application for bail but,\n\nat the same time, exercise of jurisdiction has to be based on well\n\nsettled principles and in a judicious manner and not as a matter of\n\ncourse as held by this Court in \nChaman Lal v. State of U.P. and\n\nAnr.5\n.\n\n4. (2004) 7 SCC 528\n\n5. (2004) 7 SCC 525\n\n\f 13\n\n33. \nIn \nMauji Ram v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr.\n 6, this\n\nCourt referred to \nAjay Kumar Sharma v. State of U.P. and Ors.\n 7,\n\nLokesh Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr.\n 8 and \nDataram Singh v.\n\nState of U.P. and Anr.9\n and stated categorically that this Court had\n\ntime and again emphasised the need for assigning reasons while\n\ngranting bail.\n\n34. \nIn \nLokesh Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr.\n (supra), this Court\n\nreferred to \nKalyan Chadra Sarkar v. Rajesh Ranjan\n (supra) and\n\nset aside the impugned order of the High Court granting bail.\n\n35. \nIn \nAjay Kumar Sharma\n (supra), a three-Judge Bench of this\n\nCourt relied on \nChaman Lal v. State of U.P.\n (supra) and set aside\n\norder of bail granted by the High Court holding, that it was well\n\nsettled that even though detailed examination of the merits of the\n\ncase may not be required by the courts while considering an\n\napplication for bail, at the same time exercise of discretion has to be\n\nbased on well settled principles and in a judicious manner and not as\n\na matter of course.\n\n36. There is a difference between grant of bail under \nSection 439\n of\n\nthe CrPC in case of pre-trial arrest and suspension of sentence under\n\nSection 389\n of the CrPC and grant of bail, post conviction. In the\n\nearlier case there may be presumption of innocence, which is a\n\nfundamental postulate of criminal jurisprudence, and the courts may\n\n6. (2019) 8 SCC 17\n\n7. (2005) 7 SCC 507\n\n8. (2008) 16 SCC 753\n\n9. (2018) 3 SCC 22\n\n\f 14\n\nbe liberal, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, on\n\nthe principle that bail is the rule and jail is an exception, as held by\n\nthis Court in \nDataram Singh v. State of U.P. and Anr.\n (supra).\n\nHowever, in case of post conviction bail, by suspension of operation\n\nof the sentence, there is a finding of guilt and the question of\n\npresumption of innocence does not arise. Nor is the principle of bail\n\nbeing the rule and jail an exception attracted, once there is conviction\n\nupon trial. Rather, the Court considering an application for\n\nsuspension of sentence and grant of bail, is to consider the prima\n\nfacie merits of the appeal, coupled with other factors.\n There should\n\nbe strong compelling reasons for grant of bail, notwithstanding an\n\norder of conviction, by suspension of sentence, and this strong and\n\ncompelling reason must be recorded in the order granting bail, as\n\nmandated in Section 389(1) of the Cr.P.C.\n\n37. \nIn \nVinod Singh Negi v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Anr.\n 10,\n\nthis Court set aside the impugned order of suspension of sentence\n\nand grant of appeal as the order was devoid of reasons.\n\n38. It is nobody’s case that the death of the victim was accidental\n\nor natural. There is evidence of demand of dowry, which the Trial\n\nCourt has considered. The death took place within 7 or 8 months and\n\nthere is oral evidence of the parents of cruelty and torture\n\nimmediately preceding the death. There is also evidence of payment\n\nof Rs.2,50,000/- to the Respondent-Accused by the victim’s brother.\n\nThe Respondent No.2 has not been able to demonstrate any apparent\n\n10 (2019) 8 SCC 13\n\n\f 15\n\nand/or obvious illegality or error in the judgment of the Sessions\n\nCourt, to call for suspension of execution of the sentence.\n\n39. In considering an application for suspension of sentence, the\n\nAppellate Court is only to examine if there is such patent infirmity in\n\nthe order of conviction that renders the order of conviction prima\n\nfacie erroneous. Where there is evidence that has been considered\n\nby the Trial Court, it is not open to a Court considering application\n\nunder Section 389 to re-assess and/or re-analyze the same evidence\n\nand take a different view, to suspend the execution of the sentence\n\nand release the convict on bail.\n\n40. Even though the term ‘dowry’ is not defined in the \nIndian Penal\n\nCode\n, it is defined in the \nDowry Prohibition Act, 1961\n as any valuable\n\nsecurity given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by\n\none party to the marriage to the other party to the marriage, or by\n\nany person at or before or any time after the marriage, in connection\n\nwith the marriage of the parties.\n\n41. It is difficult to appreciate how the High Court could casually\n\nhave suspended the execution of the sentence and granted bail to the\n\nRespondent No.2 without recording any reasons, with the casual\n\nobservation of force in the argument made on behalf of the Appellant\n\nbefore the High Court, that is, the Respondent No.2 herein. In effect,\n\nat the stage of an application under \nSection 389\n of the CrPC, the High\n\nCourt found merit in the submission that the brother of the victim not\n\nhaving been examined, the contention of the Respondent No.2, being\n\nthe Appellant before the High Court, that the amount of Rs.2,50,000/-\n\n\f 16\n\nwas taken as a loan was not refuted, ignoring the evidence relied\n\nupon by the Sessions Court, including the oral evidence of the\n\nvictim’s parents.\n\n42. From the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses, it transpires\n\nthat the Appellant had spent money beyond his financial capacity, at\n\nthe wedding of the victim and had even gifted an I-10 car. The\n\nhapless parents were hoping against hope that there would be an\n\namicable settlement. Even as late as on 17.6.2010 the brother of the\n\nvictim paid Rs.2,50,000/- to the Respondent No.2. The failure to lodge\n\nan FIR complaining of dowry and harassment before the death of the\n\nvictim, is in our considered view, inconsequential. The parents and\n\nother family members of the victim obviously would not want to\n\nprecipitate a complete break down of the marriage by lodging an FIR\n\nagainst the Respondent No.2 and his parents, while the victim was\n\nalive.\n\n43. For the reasons discussed above, the appeal is allowed. The\n\nimpugned order of the High Court is set aside and the Respondent\n\nNo.2 is directed to surrender for being taken into custody. The bail\n\nbonds shall stand cancelled.\n\n ................................J.\n [ARUN MISHRA]\n\n …..............................J.\n [INDIRA BANERJEE]\n\nNEW DELHI\nAUGUST 14, 2020",
