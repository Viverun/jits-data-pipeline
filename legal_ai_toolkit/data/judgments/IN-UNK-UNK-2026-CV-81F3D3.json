This is an application at the instance of the original\naccused Nos. 3,4 and 5 for anticipatory bail in connection with\n\n Page 1 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\na first information report registered with the Nadiad West\nPolice Station dated 30th October, 2017 being I-C.R. No.48 of\n2017 for the offence punishable under sections 302, 304(B),\n203 read with 114 of the \nIndian Penal Code\n and \nsections 3\n and\n\n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act.\n\n2. The first information report came to be lodged by the\nfather of the deceased. The first information report is extracted\nhereunder;\n\n \"I, Jayantibhai Devchandbhai Shrimali, age - 59 years,\n occupation - retired, resident of 29, Ashray Park Society,\n Behind Vasudev Marble, Pij Road, Nadiad, Mobile no.\n 9979259283.\n\n I state that I am residing at the above mentioned address\n with my family. I was working as a Forest Officer in the\n Nadiad Division and superannuated on 30/04/2016, and\n at present, I am living a retired life. I have two children.\n One son and one daughter, namely, Bhavin and Neelam.\n Bhavin is elder and Neelam was younger to Bhavin.\n\n The marriage of my daughter Nilamben was solemnized\n on 29/05/2015 with Nilay Kumar Natvarlal Shrimali,\n resident of B/12, Satyanarayan Society, Opp. Varia\n Prajapari Wadi, Juna Dumral Road, Nadiad as per the\n customs of our community. At the time of the marriage, I\n had given clothes and household articles to my daughter.\n After the marriage, my daughter was residing at her\n matrimonial home with her husband and mother-in-law\n Narmadaben Natvarlal Shrimali. Initially, the marriage\n life of my daughter was happy but after about three\n months of marriage, when my daughter used to visit my\n house, she told me that her husband is unemployed, and\n at present we are even unable to meet the expenses of\n the house. She also told me to help them until Nilay gets\n a job. Therefore, as my son-in-law did not had any job,\n with the purpose that they do not face any difficultly in\n their household expenses, I used to give ten to fifteen\n thousand rupees to my daughter every month as\n requested by her. Me and my other relatives frequently\n\n Page 2 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nvisited her house and helped them financially so that\nthey do not face any difficultly.\n\nAfter six months of the marriage, when my daughter\nused to visit my house, she told me that Nilay is drinking\nliquor and he is pressurizing me to bring money from me.\nMy mother-in-law Narmada Bahen is also harassing me\nregarding household work. She is taunting me by saying\nthat you are fat, your father has not given anything at\nthe time of marriage, we do not want to keep you and we\nare going to bring another wife for Nilay. They are\npressurizing me very much to bring money from you.\nMoreover, my jeth (Husband's elder brother) Chetanbhai\nNatvarbhai Shrimali working at Limkheda, my jethani\n(husband's elder brother's wife) Mamtaben Chetanbhai\nShrimali working as a teacher in Rajupura village near\nGalteshwar and my nanand (husband's sister) Hetalben\nBhavinbhai Shrimali, though are residing at Anand, yet\nthey come to my house quite often during holidays on\nSaturday and Sunday and pick up quarrel with me\nregarding the household work and dowry and instigate\nmy husband against me in order to drive me out of the\nhouse. Therefore, my husband is beating me too much.\nShe told me that my in-laws have been harassing me too\nmuch and I am fed up due to their harassment. Though I\nam pregnant at present, my in-laws make me toil too\nmuch.' As my daughter used to tell this to me, my wife\nKantaben, son Bhavin, Rasmika - wife of Bhavin and I\nused to appease her that your in-laws will mend their\nways soon and you will have good life. We used to keep\nher at our house for some days and then send her back\nto her matrimonial home. I also used to visit her\nmatrimonial home and persuade them to behave well\nwith Nilam. Sometimes, when I used to visit the\nmatrimonial home of Nilam on holidays, I also found\nChetanbhai - jeth of Nilam, Mamtaben Chetanbhai -\njethani of Nilam and Hetalben Bhavinbhai - nanand of\nNilam there. I also told them to behave well with Nilam.\nTherefore, they told me that though your daughter is\nvery fat, we have kept her. They used to pressurize me\nthat during her Shrimant, you will have to give\nornaments as demanded by us and also give gifts to our\nrelatives. Moreover, Narmadaben - mother-in-law of my\ndaughter stated that we do not want your daughter and\nshe stated in my presence that get her abortion done.\nTherefore, with the intention that her matrimonial life\n\n Page 3 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ngoes on well, I stated that I will do as stated by them.\nDespite the same, Nilay and his mother Narmadaben\ncame to my house and stated that your daughter is fat\nand she is not doing any work and in this way they used\nto pressurize for divorce of my daughter. At the time of\nShrimant ceremony of my daughter, I gave gold and\nsilver ornaments to my daughter and son-in-law costing\nabout ten lakhs as demanded by the in-laws of Nilam.\nAfter the shirmant ceremony, Nilam was brought to our\nhouse and son named Isan was born on 17/10/2016. I\nhave also given jiyanu (gift given at the time of birth) of\nmy daughter approximately of fifty thousand rupees as\ndemanded by her in-laws. My daughter went to her\nmatrimonial home but harassment of her husband and\nabove mentioned in-laws continued. Nilam used to tell\nthis to me when she used to come to my house. When I\nretired on 30/04/2016, I received money of my\nretirement benefits. The husband of Nilam and her\nmother-in-law pressurized and harassed her and sent her\nto my house to bring Rs, 20,0000/- from me in order to\nbuy a house. Therefore, I told my daughter that we need\nto buy a new house. I will give you whatever money is\nleft of my retirement benefits. After persuading her in\nthis manner, I gave her Rs. 25,000/- in cash and I also\nmade fixed deposit of one lakh rupees in the name of my\ndaughter in BOB, Ashram Road Branch, Nadiad. I used to\ngive financial support to my daughter so that her\nmatrimonial life goes on well. But the in-laws of my\ndaughter took disadvantage of my support and they used\nto harass my daughter to bring money from me.\n\nThe house in which I am residing in Nadiad at present, is\na newly purchased house and we vacated the old house\nlocated in Pagar Society, Pavanchakki Road, Nadiad. My\nson-in-law Nilaykumar quarreled with my daughter in\norder to get the old house registered in his name and she\nwas even beaten. My daughter informed me regarding\nthis. Therefore, I had even told that I will transfer that\nhouse in his name. Despite the same, as my daughter\nwas fat, my son-in-law did not like her and she was very\nmuch harassed to send her out and get divorce and even\nthe above named persons were instigating my son-in-law\nin order to send my daughter Nilam out of house and\nthey were harassing her too much.\n\nYesterday on 29/10/2017, I went to Ganj Bazar in Nadiad\n\n Page 4 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nin the evening and when I went back to my house at\nquarter past six o'clock in the evening, my son\nBhavinkumar came to my house in very much frightened\ncondition and he informed me that 'I received phone call\nof Nilaykumar on my phone before some time and he told\nme that something has happened to Nilam and it is\ninformed that you come to my house with your family\nmembers. Phone call of Nilam was even received at one\no'clock in the afternoon and she wanted to tell something\nin frightened tone. But I had felt that someone had\nsnatched away her phone. As I was out, I had told my\nwife to go to the house of Nilamben.' As he stated this, I\nwas worried about my daughter Nilam and my wife, my\nson Bhavin, daughter-in-law Rasmikaben and I left for the\nhouse of Nilam. In the meantime, my son received phone\ncall from my son-in-law Nilaykumar and as he told us to\ncome to Sanjay Hospital, Nadiad, we went to Sanjay\nHospital, Nadiad at half past six o'clock yesterday. My\ndaughter was lying unconscious over there and she was\nnot speaking anything. I met my son-in-law, Chetanbhai -\njeth of Nilam, Mamtaben - jethani of Nilam and other\npersons and they told me that when Nilam was mopping\nthe floor at the upper floor in our house at quarter past\nsix o'clock in the evening, she fell down and became\nunconscious. As they stated this and as my daughter was\nfat, I thought that she might have felt uneasy and\ntherefore, I stayed in Sanjay Hospital, Nadiad. In the\nmeantime, the doctor of Sanjay Hospital examined Nilam\nand stated that take her to bigger hospital. Therefore, we\n\n- the family members of Nilam and above mentioned\npersons of her matrimonial home, got together and took\nNilam to Mahagujarat Hospital, where the doctor\nexamined Nilam and informed that she has died and as it\nwas told to take her to Nadiad Civil, we - all the above\nmentioned persons took her to Nadiad Civil. My daughter\nhad black contusion marks from front side of throat\nextending till both the ears. The doctor informed the\npolice regarding this and as it was night time yesterday,\npostmortem of dead body of my daughter Nilam was not\nperformed. But, as postmortem of her dead body was\nperformed by panel team of doctors of Nadia Civil, the\ncause of death was given that Nilam had died due to\nsuffocation due to strangulation of throat. Therefore, I\nwas surprised. Though my daughter committed suicide\nby strangulation due to harassment of her in-laws, the\nabove mentioned persons of her matrimonial home,\n\n Page 5 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n stated that Nilam became unconscious as she fell down\n while mopping and they did not inform me the real cause\n of Nilam's death.\n\n My daughter Nilam, aged 27 years, was given too much\n physical and mental torture by her husband, mother-in-\n law Narmadaben, jeth Chetanbhai, jethani Mamtaben and\n nanand Hetalben Bhavinbhai regarding household work\n and dowry and for getting divorce as my daughter was\n fat and as they did not want to keep her and they forced\n my daughter to commit suicide and being fed up of their\n harassment, my daughter died by strangulating her\n throat yesterday on 29/10/2017 at her house before\n quarter past six o'clock in the evening. Therefore, this is\n my complaint to take legal action against all the above\n mentioned persons.\n\n The facts above of my complaint are true and correct as\n dictated by me. \"\n\n3. Thus, it appears that the deceased was married to the\noriginal accused No.1, namely, Nilaykumar Natvarlal Shrimali.\nThe marriage was solemnized on 29th May, 2015. In the\nmarriage, a son was born, namely, Isant. In the first\ninformation report, it has been alleged that the deceased was\nnot happy at her matrimonial home. There was incessant\nharassment at the end of the husband, mother-in-law and the\napplicants herein. I take notice of the fact that the applicant\nNo.1 is the brother of the husband, the applicant No.2 is the\nwife of the applicant No.1 and the applicant No.3 is the\nmarried sister of the husband. It is also alleged that there was\ndemand for dowry and as the deceased was quite fat, the\nhusband, over a period of time, developed an aversion for her.\nOn the date of the incident, the deceased was quite disturbed\ndue to the harassment at the end of the accused persons and\ntook a drastic step of committing suicide by hanging from a\nceiling fan with the aid of a Dupatta.\n\n Page 6 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n4. The applicants herein came to be arrested by the police\nin connection with the alleged offence. The applicants\npreferred the Criminal Misc. Application No.1321 of 2017 for\nregular bail in the court of the learned Principal Sessions Judge,\nKheda at Nadiad. It appears that while the court concerned\nheard the regular bail application filed by the applicants\nherein, it also jointly heard the Criminal Misc. Application\nNo.1320 of 2017 filed by the mother-in-law of the deceased.\nBy a common order dated 7th November, 2017, the bail\napplication of the applicants herein came to be allowed\nwhereas the bail application of the mother-in-law came to be\nrejected. The reasonings assigned by the court below while\npassing the common order dated 7th November, 2017 are\nextracted hereunder;\n\n \"4) Ld. Advocate Mr. D.R. Brahmabhatt for both the\n accused have mainly contended that this is first bail\n application of the applicants. The applicants of Cr. M. A.\n No.1321/2017 reside outside of Nadiad and they are\n government servants. Amongst the applicants, applicant\n no.1 is brother-in-law (Jeth) of the deceased, no.2 is\n sister-in-law (Jethani) and no.3 is brother-in-law (Nandoi),\n whereas, applicant of Cr. M. A. No.1320/2017 is mother-\n\n in-law of the deceased. The cause of action and mens rea\n are not shown anywhere in the said complaint and cause\n of suicide is also not mentioned in it. There are only\n vague allegations. No dowry has been demanded. The\n applicants are totally innocent and they are falsely\n implicated. Amongst the applicants of both the\n applications, three accused are ladies. In the\n circumstances, it is prayed to release the applicants on\n appropriate terms and conditions.\n\n 5) Ld. P.P. Mr. P.S. Dhora for the state has mainly\n contended that the applicant of Cr. M.A. No.1320/2017 is\n mother-in-law of the deceased, history given before the\n doctor involves the applicants. As per P.M. note, death is\n\n Page 7 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ncaused due to hanging. Married life was of two years.\nThere is one child and besides this, the incident has\nhappened in her in-laws house at Nadiad only.\nInvestigation is pending and therefore, it is prayed not to\nrelease the applicants on bail.\n\n6) Looking to the case papers, the complainant\nJayantibhai Devchandbhai Shrimali has lodged complaint\nbefore the police stating that he stays at Nadiad and his\nchildren includes Nilamben. Nilamben got married to\nNilaykumar Natvarlal Shrimali on 29/05/2015 at Nadiad\nand his daughter was residing with her husband and her\nmother-in-law Narmadaben. In the beginning, everything\nwas going well upto three months. When his daughter\ncame to the house of the complainant, she told that Nilay\nhas lost his job and told to help her, therefore, the\ncomplainant gave her ten to fifteen thousand rupees.\nAfter six months of marriage, his daughter came to his\nhouse and told that Nilay is addicted to liquor and he\npressurizes to bring money from you. My mother-in-law\nharasses me regarding household work and says that you\nare fat and your parents haven't given anything on the\noccasion of the marriage. She stated that she wants to\nget another marriage of Nilay to be done and pressurizes\nme to bring money. Brother-in-law (Jeth) Chetanbhai,\nsister-in-laws (Jethani) Mamtaben and (Nanand) Hetalben\nused to come on the weekends of Saturday-Sunday and\nused to instigate Nilay regarding household work, dowry\nand to drive her out from the house. Nilay beats her up\nand also does not provide proper food to eat. Thereafter,\nhe used to send his daughter back to the in-laws house\nafter persuading her. The said persons had taken\njewellary of about ten lakh rupees forcefully at the time\nof Shrimant and also told the complainant that your\ndaughter is fat and we do not want her and stated to get\nher foetus aborted. He gave Jiyanu for new born baby\nboy of fifty thousand rupees. As the complainant retired\nfrom the service, he told to give twenty lakh rupees to\nNilam out of the amount he received. Her husband and\nmother-in-law pressurized her and sent her to the house\nof the complainant. But the complainant could not give\nthe money as he wanted to buy new house. He sent her\ndaughter back with twenty five thousand rupees. He\ndeposited one lakh rupees in Fixed Deposit at Bank of\nBaroda, Ashram Road Branch, Nadiad in the name of his\ndaughter. He was stated to transfer the present house in\n\n Page 8 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe name of his son-in-law and quarreled for the same.\nThey were harassing her to get divorce and to make her\nget out as she was fat. Meanwhile, Bhavinbhai, son of the\ncomplainant met him on 29/10/2017 and informed that\nNilaykumar telephoned and stated that something has\nhappened to Nilam. At one o'clock in the afternoon,\nNilam made telephone. She was found scarred and she\nwanted to say something but he felt that phone was\nsnatched from her. The complainant, his wife, son and\ndaughter-in-law got out and went to Sanjiv Hospital. His\ndaughter was unconscious. The accused stated him that\nNilam fell down when she was mopping on the upper\nfloor and went unconscious. The doctor of Sanjiv Hospital\ntold to take Nilam to big hospital and therefore, all took\nNilam to Mahagujarat Hospital, there doctor checked her\nand declared her dead. His daughter had black marks\nfrom front part of the throat till both ears. Thereafter, she\nwas taken to the Civil Hospital, where it was stated by\nthe doctor in P.M. that cause of death was asphyxia due\nto strangulation. Though Nilam had strangulated, the in-\nlaws persons had stated that Nilam fell down when she\nwas mopping on the upper floor and went unconscious.\nThus, as her daughter was fat and they did not want to\nkeep her with them, they subjected her to physical and\nmental torture in order to have divorce and thus,\ncompelled her to commit suicide.\n\n7) Considering all the facts mentioned here-above, it is\nalleged that the complainant's daughter Nilam has\ncommitted suicide for the reasons mentioned in the\ncomplaint and statements of the witnesses are\ncorroborating it. It is mentioned in the P.M. note that\ndeath was caused due to strangulation, which is taken\ninto consideration. The applicant no.1 - Brother-in-law\n(Jeth) and no.2 - Sister-in-law (Jethani) of Cr. M.A.\nNo.1321/2017 are residing at Limkheda and the applicant\nno.3 - Sister-in-law (Nanand) is residing at Anand, that\nmeans, all these three applicants are not residing at\nNadiad and it is alleged that they tortured her on\nholidays, which are taken into consideration. Whereas\nthe applicant of Cr. M.A. No.1320/2017, Narmadaben is\nmother-in-law of the deceased and it appears from the\npolice investigation papers that she was residing with\nNilam at Nadiad. Considering all the above mentioned\nfacts, it is noted that the role of the applicants of Cr. M.A.\nNo.1320/2017 are different to some extent from the\n\n Page 9 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\napplicant of Cr. M.A. No.1321/2017.\n\n8) It is settled principle of law that the evidences are\nnot to be appreciated at the time of deciding the bail\napplication by analyzing it at length, but it is required to\nfind as to whether there is prima-facie case against the\napplicant or not and whether the applicant is entitled to\nbe released on bail or not. Evidence in the present\napplication is not appreciated after analyzing it. The\nobservations made regarding the said application are\nlimited to the decision as to whether the bail application\nshould be allowed or not and it is hereby clarified that\nthe said observations shall not affect the trial of the case.\n\n9) Considering the facts, details, circumstances and\nrole of the applicants of both the applications, it does not\ndeem just and reasonable to exercise judicial discretion\nconferred under Section - 439 of the Cr. P.C. against the\napplicant of Cr. M.A. No.1320/2017, whereas it deems\njust and reasonable to exercise judicial discretion\nconferred under Section - 439 of the Cr. P.C. against the\napplicants of Cr. M.A. No.1321/2017 and to release them\non several strict conditions, following order is passed in\nthe interest of justice.\n\n ORDER\n\n1) Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.1320/2017 is\nhereby rejected, whereas, Criminal Miscellaneous\nApplication No.1321/2017 is hereby allowed.\n\n2) The applicants of Criminal Miscellaneous\nApplication No.1321/2017 are hereby ordered to be\nreleased on regular bail for the punishable offences\nunder \nSection-498(A)\n, \n306\n, \n114\n of I.P.C. in the case of I-\nC.R. No.489/2017 registered with Nadiad West Police\nStation on furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees\nTen Thousand Only) each and surety of like amount\nsubject to following conditions.\n\n Conditions\n\n1. Not to temper with the evidences of the prosecution\nand not to make direct or indirect attempts to induce the\nwitnesses by temptations or allurements.\n\n Page 10 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n 2. To maintain peace and tranquility and not to get\n involved in any other offences.\n\n 3. To furnish present as well as permanent residential\n address in the bail bonds before Ld. Lower Court and not\n to change the same without prior permission of the court\n having jurisdiction. Applicants to produce their mobile\n numbers and land-line numbers and not to change the\n same without permission of the Honorable Court.\n\n 4. Not to leave the State of Gujarat without prior\n permission of this Court.\n\n 5. To submit Original Passport before the Ld. Lower\n Court within three days after release on bail, if any, and if\n not having Passport, Affidavit regarding the same before\n the Concerned Lower Court within three days.\n\n 6. To remain present before investigating officer as\n and when called for and to co-operate in the police\n investigation for the offence.\n\n 7) The applicant no. 1 shall have to mark his presence\n before the concerned Police Station during 1st to 5th of\n every English month between 10:00 a.m. and 02:00 p.m.\n till Charge-sheet is filed and the investigating officer shall\n forward copy of the record wherein the applicant has\n marked his presence and if not remained present, report\n thereof to the Ld. Lower Court from 6th to 10th of\n concerned English month and the applicant as well as the\n investigating officer shall follow this instructions strictly.\"\n\n5. It appears from the materials on record that the police\ncompleted the investigation and filed charge-sheet for the\noffence punishable under sections 498A, 302, 304B, 203 read\nwith 114 of the \nIndian Penal Code\n and \nsections 3\n and \n4\n of the\nDowry Prohibition Act. It appears that at the end of the\ninvestigation, the police reached to the conclusion that the\ncase is one of homicidal death and not suicidal death. In such\ncircumstances, the first informant, i.e,. the father of the\n\n Page 11 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ndeceased preferred an application under \nsection 439(2)\n of the\nIPC for the cancellation of bail of the three applicants. The\nCriminal Misc. Application No.1513 of 2017 filed by the original\nfirst informant for the cancellation of bail of the three\napplicants herein came to be allowed by the Principal Sessions\nJudge, Kheda at Nadiad vide order dated 6th February, 2018.\nThe reasonings assigned by the court below while cancelling\nthe bail of the three applicants herein are extracted hereunder;\n\n \"Looking to the above reference, the present application\n has not been made by the prosecution. But, it has been\n made on behalf of the original complainant and as\n discussed above, according to the judgment of Hon'ble\n Supreme Court, the original complainant can prefer an\n application for cancellation of bail. In these\n circumstances, Hon'ble High Court has also observed\n that, if the more serious offence is revealed, the\n prosecution should make an application to cancel the bail\n or for modification of order. Looking to all these facts,\n the offence under section-306 of \nI.P.C\n. was constituted,\n wherein the imprisonment of 10 years was provided.\n Now, the offence is under section-302 of \nI.P.C\n. which\n provides the punishment of life imprisonment or death.\n In such circumstances, as the more serious offence is\n revealed, the original complainant has made the present\n application, which has been taken into consideration.\n\n (8) The following grounds and issues have been taken\n into account to decide the application for\n cancellation of the bail.\n\n 1. When aforesaid respondents were released on the\n bail earlier, they were charged\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C.\n and maximum punishment for the said offence is 10\n years.\n\n 2. Thereafter, police investigation has been conducted\n and it is revealed during the investigation that\n offence\n u/s 302\n of the I.P.C. is made out and\n accordingly, report to add section was filed in the\n lower court and the same was granted. Thereafter,\n charge-sheet has been also filed against present\n\n Page 12 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n applicants and other co-accused u/s 302 of I.P.C.\n\n3. The applicants were charged u/s 306 of the I.P.C.\n\n when their earlier bail application was decided. The\n strangulation was shown as cause of death in the\n P.M. note interalia it was also mentioned therein\n that final cause of death could be known after\n receiving viscera and histopathology report.\n Thereafter, it has been stated in the P.M. note on\n 09/01/2018 that looking to histopathological report\n and F.S.L. report, final cause of death was\n strangulation. Under these circumstances, final\n cause of death was not mentioned in the P.M. Note\n at the time of deciding earlier bail application and\n only probable cause was mentioned. Whereas\n strangulation has been shown as final cause of\n death after receiving F.S.L. report, and the said fact\n has been taken into account.\n\n4. Earlier, charge\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C. was levelled and\n maximum punishment for the said offence was 10\n years. Now, \nsection 302\n of the I.P.C. has been\n added, and maximum punishment for the said\n offence is life imprisonment and death penalty.\n Under these circumstances, more serious charge\n has been revealed on the completion of police\n investigation than was found earlier.\n\n5. The bail was granted for the offence u/s 306 of the\n I.P.C - less serious offence earlier, whereas more\n serious offence is being made out and respondents\n have been charged u/s 302 of the I.P.C.\n\n6. As per the aforesaid judgement of the Hon'ble High\n Court, original complainant has filed application for\n cancellation of the bail. As per the judgment of\n Hon'ble Supreme Court, original complainant can\n make this nature of application.\n\n(9) It is a well established principle of the law that\nevidences are not required to be analyzed in depth and\nevaluated while deciding bail application. But, it is to be\nseen as to whether prima facie case is made out against\nthe accused or not and as to whether applicant is liable\nto be released on bail or not. The evidences have not\nbeen analyzed and evaluated in connection with the\npresent application. The observations made in\nconnection with aforesaid application are restricted to\ndeciding as to whether this bail application should be\ngranted or not. It is clarified that trial of the case will not\n\n Page 13 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n bear any effect of these observations.\n\n (10) Considering all the facts, issues and reasons\n discussed above, and considering the fact that, now\n more serious offence has been revealed to have occurred\n and the final cause of death is mentioned as\n strangulation in the P.M. note after granting the previous\n bail application, the bail granted to the present\n opponents in Criminal Miscellaneous Application\n NO.1321/2017, is liable to be rejected. Therefore, below\n final order is passed in the interest of justice.\n\n ORDER\n\n (1) The bail, granted to the present opponents Nos. 1\n to 3 as per the order dated: 07/11/2017 passed in\n Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.1321/2017, is\n hereby cancelled.\n\n (2) The above opponent Nos. 1 to 3 shall surrender\n themselves before the Investigation Officer / Competent\n Officer, within 15 days.\"\n\n6. As the bail came to be cancelled by the Sessions Court,\nthe applicants herein apprehended arrest once again by the\npolice. In such circumstance, the three applicants preferred\nthe Criminal Misc. Application No.171 of 2018 for anticipatory\nbail in the Sessions Court. The application filed by the\napplicants for anticipatory bail came to be rejected by the\ncourt below by order dated 9th February, 2018. The reasonings\nassigned by the court below while rejecting the anticipatory\nbail application are extracted hereunder;\n\n \"(6) The applicants had earlier filed Criminal\n Miscellaneous Application No. 1321/2017\n u/s 438\n of\n Cr.P.C. for anticipatory bail in this court and the same\n was related to the offence\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C. This court\n granted the same on 07/11/2017. Thereafter, \nsections\n 302\n, \n304(B)\n of the I.P.C. were added during the police\n investigation. The charge sheet was filed in the lower\n court in this regard. Therefore, original complainant\n\n Page 14 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nJayantibhai Devchandbhai Shrimali filed Criminal\nMiscellaneous Application no. 1513/2017 against these\napplicants\n u/s 439(2)\n of Cr.P.C. for cancellation of bail in\nthis court. This court granted the said application of the\ncomplainant seeking cancellation of the bail vide order\ndated 06/02/2018 and cancelled anticipatory bail of the\napplicants and ordered them to surrender before the\nInvestigating Officer/Competent Authority within 15 days.\n\nThe following grounds and issues were taken into\naccount to decide application for cancellation of the bail\nin para no. 8.\n\n(8) The following grounds and issues have been taken\n into account to decide the application for\n cancellation of the bail.\n\n 1. When aforesaid respondents were\n released on the bail earlier, they were\n charged\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C. and\n maximum punishment for the said\n offence is 10 years.\n\n 2. Thereafter, police investigation has been\n conducted and it is revealed during the\n investigation that offence\n u/s 302\n of the\n I.P.C. is made out and accordingly,\n report to add section was filed in the\n lower court and the same was granted.\n\n Thereafter, charge-sheet has been also\n filed against present applicants and\n other co-accused u/s 302 of I.P.C.\n\n 3. The applicants were charged\n u/s 306\n of\n the I.P.C. when their earlier bail\n application was decided. The\n strangulation was shown as cause of\n death in the P.M. note interalia it was\n also mentioned therein that final cause\n of death could be known after receiving\n viscera and histopathology report.\n\n Thereafter, it has been stated in the P.M.\n note on 09/01/2018 that looking to\n histopathological report and F.S.L.\n report, final cause of death was\n strangulation. Under these\n circumstances, final cause of death was\n not mentioned in the P.M. Note at the\n time of deciding earlier bail application\n\n Page 15 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n and only probable cause was mentioned.\n\n Whereas strangulation has been shown\n as final cause of death after receiving\n F.S.L. report, and the said fact has been\n taken into account.\n\n 4. Earlier, charge\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C. was\n levelled and maximum punishment for\n the said offence was 10 years. Now,\n \nsection 302\n of the I.P.C. has been added,\n and maximum punishment for the said\n offence is life imprisonment and death\n penalty. Under these circumstances,\n more serious charge has been revealed\n on the completion of police investigation\n than was found earlier.\n\n 5. The bail was granted for the offence u/s\n 306 of the I.P.C - less serious offence\n earlier, whereas more serious offence is\n being made out and respondents have\n been charged u/s 302 of the I.P.C.\n\n 6. As per the aforesaid judgement of the\n Hon'ble High Court, original complainant\n has filed application for cancellation of\n the bail. As per the judgment of Hon'ble\n Supreme Court, original complainant can\n make this nature of application.\n\n(7) After aforesaid Criminal Miscellaneous Application\nNo. 1513/2017 was decided, applicant filed present\napplication u/s 438 of Cr.P.C. for anticipatory bail wherein\npresent applicants are charged u/s 302 of the I.P.C.\n\n(8) The following issues and grounds have been taken\ninto account while deciding present bail application.\n\n 1. The reason no. 1 to 6 mentioned in para 8 of\n Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.\n 1513/2017 seeking cancellation of bail have\n been taken into account.\n\n 2. The order granting anticipatory bail to the\n applicants for the offence\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C.\n was passed earlier, but thereafter, as stated\n above, application seeking cancellation of bail\n was granted. The \nsection 302\n of the I.P.C was\n added. As the said offence was more serious,\n the bail was cancelled.\n\n Page 16 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n 3. When application for anticipatory bail was\n granted, charge\n u/s 306\n of the I.P.C. was\n levelled, whereas charge\n u/s 302\n of the I.P.C.\n for more serious offence has been now\n levelled.\n\n 4. The final opinion has been given in the P.M.\n note in January, 2018 after receiving F.S.L.\n report that deceased died due to\n strangulation.\n\n 5. Maximum punishment for the said offence is\n life imprisonment or death penalty.\n\n 6. Further, other co-accused Narmadaben w/o.\n\n Natwarlal Shrimali filed Criminal Miscellaneous\n Application No. 1320/2017 and Criminal\n Miscellaneous Application No. 118/2018 in this\n court, and the same were rejected by this\n court. Thereafter, said accused filed Criminal\n Miscellaneous Application No. 27713/2017\n before Hon'ble High Court and the same was\n withdrawn. Thereafter, other co-accused\n Nilaykumar Natwarlal Shrimali, who is the\n husband of the deceased, filed Criminal\n Miscellaneous Application No. 150/2018 in this\n court, and the said application was rejected by\n this court on 08/02/2018. All these facts have\n been taken into account.\n\n 7. The applicants have been charged for serious\n nature of offence.\n\n(9) It is a well established principle of law that\nevidences are not required to be analyzed in depth and\nevaluated while deciding bail application. But, it is to be\nseen as to whether prima facie case is made out against\nthe accused or not and as to whether applicant is liable\nto be released on bail or not. The evidences have not\nbeen analyzed and evaluated in connection with the\npresent application. The observations made in\nconnection with aforesaid application are restricted to\ndeciding as to whether this bail application should be\ngranted or not. It is clarified that trial of the case will not\nbear any effect of these observations.\n\n(10) Thus, in view of aforesaid all the facts, gravity\nof the offence, aforesaid issues and grounds and in\nentirety, as it does not appear to be just, reasonable and\nappropriate to use judicial discretion in favour of the\n\n Page 17 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n applicants\n u/s 438\n of Cr.P.C., the following final order is\n passed.\n\n ORDER\n\n The bail application being Criminal Miscellaneous\n Application No. 171/2018 is rejected.\"\n\n7. In such circumstances, referred to above, the applicants\nhave come up before this Court with a prayer for grant of\nanticipatory bail.\n\n8. The facts emerging from the materials on record are that\nthe first information report was registered for the offence\npunishable under sections 498A, 306 read with 114 of the \nIPC\n\nand \nsections 3\n and \n4\n of the Dowry Prohibition Act. At the time\nwhen the first information report was registered, the case of\nthe first informant was very specific. The case of the first\ninformant was that his daughter, i.e, the deceased had\ncommitted suicide at her matrimonial home on account of the\nincessant harassment and torture at the end of the accused\npersons. On completion of the investigation, the charge-sheet,\nultimately came to be filed for the offence of murder, or in the\nalternative, for the offence of dowry death. The three\napplicants were already enlarged on regular bail by the\nSessions Court. It is only when the charge-sheet came to be\nfiled for the offence of murder as well as dowry death that the\nfirst informant thought fit to file an application to get the bail\nof the three applicants cancelled. Ultimately, the Sessions\nCourt thought fit to cancel the bail. The three applicants\nherein, once again, preferred an application for anticipatory\nbail before the Sessions Court, which came to be rejected. It\nappears that while passing the order of cancellation of bail, the\ncourt below suspended the operation of the order for few days\n\n Page 18 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nto enable the applicants to avail of appropriate remedy before\nthe appropriate forum in accordance with law.\n\n9. In such circumstances, referred to above, I inquired with\nthe learned APP as to on what basis the Investigating Officer\nfiled the charge-sheet for the offence of murder punishable\nunder \nsection 302\n of the IPC as well as for the offence of dowry\ndeath punishable under \nsection 304B\n of the IPC. I had to put\nthis question to the learned APP because at the time when the\napplicants herein were released on regular bail by the court\nbelow, the postmortem report was very much before the\nSessions Court. The cause of death assigned in the\npostmortem report, on receipt of the Histopathological report\nis cardiorespiratory arrest due to mechanical asphyxia\nfollowing strangulation. The learned APP clarified that the\nInvestigating Officer had a talk with the Medical Officer as\nregards the fact whether the case is one of suicidal\nstrangulation or homicidal strangulation. According to the\nlearned APP, the Medical Officer, with whom, the Investigating\nOfficer had a talk, prima facie, expressed his opinion that the\ncase is one of homicidal death and not suicidal. I inquired with\nthe learned APP whether there is anything in writing in this\nregard.. To put it in other words, whether the Investigating\nOfficer has obtained any such opinion from the concerned\nmedical officer in writing. The learned APP, after taking\ninstructions from the Investigating Officer, submitted that\nthere is no such opinion in writing. It was just an oral\ndiscussion between the Investigating Officer and the doctor\nconcerned. According to the learned APP, in such\ncircumstances, ultimately when time came to file the charge-\nsheet, the same was filed for the offence of murder.\n\n Page 19 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n10. Mr. Brahmbhatt, the learned counsel appearing for the\napplicants submitted that there is nothing on record on the\nbasis of which it could be said that the case is one of homicidal\ndeath. According to him, the theory which is now being put\nforward by the prosecution that all the accused persons,\ntogether, strangulated the deceased to death by a Dupatta, is\nan afterthought. The postmortem report, prima facie, would\nindicate that the case is one of suicide by hanging. Mr.\nBrahmbhatt, at this stage, invited my attention to the two\nstatements of the independent witnesses residing in the\nneighbourhood. According to Mr. Brahmbhatt, these two\nstatements of the independent witnesses completely rules out\nthe theory of homicidal strangulation. The two statements,\nwhich the learned counsel for the applicants is referring to, are\none of Manibhai Madhavbhai Maheriya recorded on 30th\nOctober, 2017 and the another one is of his son Ravikumar\nManibhai Maheriya recorded on 30th October, 2017. The\nstatement of Manibhai is extracted hereunder;\n\n \"My name is Manibhai Madhavbhai Maheriya, age 63,\n Occupation : Retired, resident of B/5, Satya Narayan\n Society, Opp. Sharda Mandir School, Nadiad, Ta.Nadiad,\n Mo.No. 95868 78110.\n\n On being personally asked, I state that I am residing at\n the above mentioned address alongwith my family.\n Presently, I live retired life. I am native of Karoli,\n Ta.Nadiad. I have one son and one daughter. I have\n studied upto MA Part-1.\n\n Today as you stated me the facts of the complaint being\n I.C.R.

When I\n was at my home, at around six o'clock in the evening,\n Nilaybhai repeatedly shouted and called my son Ravi at\n his house. Thereafter, I stated my son to visit Nilay's\n house as I sensed some problem there. My son went\n there. There was an uproar. As Mamtaben, wife of\n Narmadaben's son Chetan came downstairs screaming, I\n doubted something untoward there. When I reached to\n first floor of Narmadaben's house, I found Nilam hanging\n from ceiling fan with dupatta in the bedroom of the first\n floor. Nilay was crying by holding her. At that time, other\n people of my society also came there. All of them\n together cut the dupatta tied with her neck and brought\n her down. Her family members took her for the treatment\n by the car of Kalpeshbhai Rohit residing in my society.\n Firstly, she was taken to Sanjay Hospital and thereafter\n to Mahagujarat Hospital where the doctor declared her\n dead. I do not know as to why Nilam hanged herself.

Let me, at this stage, also look into the report filed by the\nInvestigating Officer dated 9th November, 2017 in the court of\nthe JMFC, Nadiad for addition of \nsection 302\n of the IPC in the\nfirst information report.

Chetankumar Natwarlal Shrimali,\n\n Page 23 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n presently residing at Limkheda, Dist.

Bhavinkumar Shrimali, presently residing\n at A-2, Palav Tenement, Avsar Party Plot, Chikhodra\n Road, Anand, all are originally resident of B-12,\n Satyanarayan Society, Opp. Sharda Mandir School,\n Nadiad, and thereby, in-laws of Nilamben abetted one\n another in driving her to commit suicide. After being fed\n up with such harassment caused by her in-laws, she had\n strangulated herself by tying Duppta with ceiling fan on\n the upper floor at her in-laws house at Satyanarayan\n Society, Nadiad, on 29/10/2017 at 18 :15 hours. When\n she was taken for the treatment by her in-laws, the\n doctor declared her dead on the same day at 19:00\n hours. As the complainant lodged the complaint in this\n regard, I registered the offence against the said accused\n persons vide aforesaid register number and sections on\n 30/10/2017 at 12:30 O'clock and took over the charge of\n investigation. Thereafter, all the accused persons were\n arrested on 30/10/2017 at 17:30 O'clock and sent to\n judicial custody within time limit.\n\n Today, on perusing the P.M. note of the deceased\n Nilamben W/o. Nilaykumar Shrimali, age : 27, residing at\n B-12, Satyanarayn Society, Opp. Sharda Mandir School,\n Nadiad, the Medical Officer, Civil Hospital, Nadiad, has\n opined that the deceased has died due to strangulation.\n Therefore, as the accused persons have killed the\n deceased by strangulating her and thereby, as the\n offence punishable\n u/s. 302\n of I.P.C. has occurred, it is\n requested to include the section - 302 of \nI.P.C\n. in the\n complaint of the present offence. The P.M. note of the\n deceased is enclosed. It may be noted. Dt : 09/11/2017. \"\n\n13. Mr. Brahmbhatt, the learned counsel submitted that\nindisputably, the applicants are residing separately. On the\ndate of the incident, being a weekend, the applicants decided\nto visit the house of their mother, and in such circumstances,\nthey were present in the house when the deceased committed\nsuicide. He submitted that the deceased committed suicide in\nher room situated on the first floor of the house by hanging\nherself from a ceiling fan with the aid of a Dupatta.\n\n Page 24 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n14. The principal argument of the learned counsel appearing\nfor the applicants is that the medical evidence on record does\nnot rule out the possibility of suicide on the part of the\ndeceased. In fact, according to the learned counsel, the\nmedical evidence on record only points towards the theory of\nsuicide. He submitted that there is nothing to indicate that the\ndeath was caused by strangulation, i.e. by pressing the neck of\nthe deceased. Although, at this stage, the medical opinion,\naccording to the Investigating Officer, in this case, is one of\nstrangulation by suicide, yet if the entire medical evidence is\nlooked into in details, it only substantiates the theory of suicide\nby hanging. The learned counsel appearing for the applicants\nvehemently submitted that it is the question of personal liberty\nof the applicants and if there is a reasonable doubt as regards\nwhether the case is one of homicidal strangulation or suicidal\nhanging, then the benefit of doubt should go to the accused\npersons. The argument proceeds on the footing that if the\ncourt below did not find any case against the applicants so far\nas abetting the commission of suicide is concerned, then there\nis no reason to believe that the applicants would go to the\nextent of strangulating the deceased to death along with the\nhusband and the mother-in-law of the deceased.\n\n15. In such circumstances, referred to above, the learned\ncounsel for the applicants pray that there being a considerable\ndoubt as regards the alleged complicity of the accused persons\nin the crime, discretion may be exercised in favour of the\napplicants and they be granted the relief of anticipatory bail.\n\n16. On the other hand, this application has been vehemently\n\n Page 25 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nopposed by Ms. Thakkar, the learned APP appearing for the\nState. The learned APP submitted that even if there is any\ndoubt, at this stage, as regards whether the case at hand is\none of homicidal death or suicidal hanging, the applicants do\nnot deserve to be granted any relief. According to the learned\nAPP the principle of rule of reasonable doubt will not apply at\nthe stage of bail. This principle of rule of reasonable doubt will\napply at the stage of trial, i.e. at the time when the Trial Court\nhas to appreciate the overall evidence on record. At this stage,\naccording to the learned APP, all that needs to be looked into is\nwhether there is a prima facie case against the applicants or\nnot. The learned APP submits that the words used in \nsection\n437\n Cr.P.C are \"reasons to believe\". According to the learned\nAPP, the postmortem report does not completely rule out the\ntheory of the deceased being strangulated to death by the\naccused persons with a Dupatta. It is submitted that it is only\nwhen the expert witnesses will enter the witness box that the\npicture would be clear. At this stage, this Court may not go into\nthe question whether the case is one of homicidal death or\nsuicidal death.\n\n17. This application has also been vehemently opposed by\nMr. Tejas Barot the learned counsel appearing for the original\nfirst informant. I permitted Mr. Barot to make his submissions\nas I thought that his assistance would be of some help to this\nCourt having regard to the issue in question. Mr. Barot\nsubmitted that the case is one of homicidal death. According to\nhim, the injuries which have been noted in the postmortem\nreport do point towards the theory of homicidal death or, at\nleast, creates a considerable doubt in that regard. Mr. Barot\nalso submitted that even if there is any doubt in this regard, at\n\n Page 26 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthis stage, the benefit should not go to the applicants. He\nsubmitted that the issue in question can be gone into by the\nTrial Court at the stage when the expert witnesses would enter\nthe box. In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Barot\nprays that there being no merit in this application, the same be\nrejected.\n\n18. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the\nparties and having considered the materials on record, the\nonly question that falls for my consideration is whether I should\nexercise my discretion in favour of the applicants.\n\n19. As noted above, the applicants were already released on\nregular bail by the order of the Sessions Court way back on 7th\nNovember, 2017. It is only when the Investigating Officer\nentertained a doubt in his mind after talking to the Medical\nOfficer concerned that \nsection 302\n of the IPC came to be\nadded and the bail of the three applicants was ordered to be\ncancelled. Thus, the only point for my consideration, at this\nstage, is whether there is any substance in the theory of\nhomicidal death put forward by the prosecution.\n\n20. Mr. Brahmbhatt invited the attention of this Court to one\nDivision Bench decision of this Court, to which, I was a party.\nThe Division Bench decision of this Court was rendered in a\nCriminal Appeal No.2233 of 2009 dated 29.04.2014 filed by a\nconvict-accused, and in the said appeal, the issue was whether\nthe case was one of homicidal death or suicidal hanging. While\ndeciding the said appeal, the Division Bench explained the\nterm asphyxia including suffocation, hanging and\nstrangulation. As the learned counsel appearing for the\n\n Page 27 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\napplicants seeks to rely upon the same, I deem it fit to extract\nthe observations hereunder;\n\n \"26.1 What is asphyxia?\n\n Asphyxia may be defined as primarily a state, or series of\n states, induced by an oxygen supply short of tissue\n needs. There are two forms of asphyxia. In the first form\n there is gasping for breath and marked cyanosis with\n retention of carbon dioxide and depletion of oxygen. In\n the second form there is no cyanosis, the asphyxia being\n due to depletion of oxygen, or anoxaemia, without\n retention of carbon dioxide. Shallow rapid breathing is\n present which causes the anoxaemia and also an\n excessive elimination of carbon dioxide, with resultant\n failure of the respiratory centre. In this form there is no\n sign of respiratory distress.\n\n Asphyxia may be produced in many ways, including the\n following:-\n\n Occlusion of the air-passages by foreign bodies, the\n effects of scalding or corrosives, angioneurotic oedema,\n acute inflammation, membranous exudations, acute\n oedema of the glottis, laryngeal spasm, tumours, and\n abscesses.\n\n Impediment to respiratory function by pressure on the\n chest wall, for example, by falls of debris, and in lift and\n pit-cage accidents.\n\n Strangulation, suffocation, hanging, throttling, drowning,\n and the inhalation of irrespirable gases.\n\n Paralysis of the respiratory nerves or muscles, or of the\n respiratory centre from injury or disease, or from the\n action of certain poisons, for example, morphine and\n barbiturates.\n\n From causes operating from the lungs, or pulmonary\n circulatory system, for example, lung diseases, pleural\n effusions, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism.\n\n 26.2 What is suffocation?\n\n Page 28 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nThe term suffocation embraces the causes by which\ndeath is produced by impediment to respiration, not due\nto pressure externally and immediately applied to the\nwindpipe. It does not, therefore, include deaths by\nhanging, strangulation, or throttling, but comprises\ndeaths by smothering or overlaying, those due to foreign\nbodies in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, and those due\nto irrespirable gases. Suffocation may, therefore, result\nfrom natural disease, accident, or violence suicidally or\nhomicidally applied.\n\nDeath by suffocation may be caused:-\n\nBy prevention of the action of the muscles of respiration.\nBy obstruction to the entrance of air through the mouth\nand nostrils.\n\nBy obstruction of the larynx, trachea, or bronchi.\nBy inhalation of irrespirable gases.\n\n26.3 What is hanging?\n\nHanging may be defined as that form of death which is\ncaused by suspension of the body by a ligature which\nencircles the neck, the constricting force being the\nweight of the body. A frequent method is the use of a\nrunning noose. The proximate cause of death is asphyxia\nor comato-asphyxia.\n\nThe time occupied in the process of death depends\nchiefly upon two factors, the severity of the constricting\nforce and the point of application of that force.\n\nThe amount of the constricting force depends upon\nwhether or not the body is completely suspended.\nComplete suspension is not essential since the partial\nweight of the body is adequate for the purpose. Persons\nhave succeeded in hanging themselves although their\nfeet were in contact with the floor. Only a slight degree of\nconstriction of the neck is required to cause eventual\ndeath. When, however, the entire body is suspended,\ngreater weight is thrown upon the ligature and a greater\nconstricting force results. When such a degree of force is\napplied to the neck, death supervenes more rapidly than\nin the case of partial suspension with a diminished\ndegree of constrictive force. When the ligature is not\n\n Page 29 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\ntight, death may ensure slowly, chiefly from the effects of\ncoma induced by disturbance of the cerebral circulation\nas the result of pressure on the vessels in the neck. The\npoint of application of the force is an important factor not\nonly in the time occupied in dying, but in the subsequent\npostmortem appearances.\n\n26.4 What is strangulation?\n\nStrangulation may be defined as that form of death which\nis caused by a constricting force applied around the neck\nby means of a ligature without suspension of the body.\nThrottling, or manual strangulation, is that form of death\nwhich is caused by compression of the throat, the\nconstricting force being the fingers and the hand or\nhands of the assailant. Ordinary strangulation may be\ncaused accidentally, suicidally, or homicidally. The\nconstricting mark is usually found at a lower level on the\nneck than in hanging, but may be found at any level, and\nfrequently direct pressure is exerted upon the larynx. The\nmark more or less completely encircles the neck\ntransversely. In some cases it may be continuous, but in\nothers it may be invisible at some part of the neck. The\nnature of the ligature employed plays a prominent part in\nthis respect. The degree and character of injury to the\ndeeper tissues of the neck are dependent on the amount\nof violence used in the application of the ligature. The\nunderlying muscles frequently show some degree of\nextravasation, due to rupture of the capillary vessels. The\nlaryngeal cartilages and trachea are usually intact, but in\nsome cases, especially homicidal cases, fractures of\nthese structures are present. Fracture of the hyoid bone\nis unusual. The injuries in homicidal strangulation are\nusually more extensive than in accidental or suicidal\ncases, due to the fact that an assailant frequently uses\nmore force than is necessary to cause the death of his\nvictim. It is in such cases that extensive deep-seated\ninjury is likely to be found. When a ligature is suddenly\nplaced around the neck of a person and pulled tightly,\nthe assaulted person is rendered unconscious very\nquickly and is unable to offer much resistance. [See\nMedical Jurisprudence & Toxicology by Glaister XI\nEdition)\"\n\n28. Before we proceed further, it would be relevant to\nquote below the expert opinion on suicidal death and\n\n Page 30 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nhomicidal death:-\n\n28.1 Noted author Dr. C. K. Parikh in \"Parikh's Textbook\nof Medical Jurisprudence, Forensic Medicine and\nToxicology\" Sixth Edition in this respect offered expert\nopinion as under:\n\n\"Suicide, homicide, or accident : Suicidal strangulation is\nnot common although instances have been known. To\neffect suicide by ligature requires the employment of\nsome means (e.g., a tourniquet) whereby the ligature is\nkept tight independently of any muscular effort on the\npart of the suicide. In suicide, the ligature should be\nfound in situ and the body should be free from other\nsigns of violence or marks of struggle. The knot is usually\nin front.\n\nHomicidal strangulation is a common form of murder. In\nfact, strangulating should be assumed to be homicidal\nuntil the contrary is proven to be more likely under the\ncircumstances. A suspicion of homicide should arise\nwhen (a) knot is tied on the back of neck, (b) mouth is\ngagged, (c) limbs are tied, (d) other injuries are found on\nthe body, (e) signs of struggle are present, and (f) in case\nof female, if she is sexually assaulted; and in such a case,\nmaterial that is readily available at hand, e.g., a nylon\nstocking, pantyhose, or the scarf of the victim, is used as\na ligature. Tearing of clothes may be seen.\"\n\n28.2 Likewise H.W.V.Cox in his book \"Medical\nJurisprudence and Toxicology\" offered expert opinion as\nunder :\n\n\"(d) Strangulation - Strangulation by a ligature is quite\npossible in a suicidal manner, the suicider being able to\nwrap several turns of rope or wire around his neck and\ntie a complicated knot before unconsciousness occurs.\n\nSometimes a \"Spanish windlass\" devise is used in which\na loose ligature is tightened up by inserting a stick under\nthe ligature and twisting until it becomes tight. This is\nquite possible in suicide but of course could also be a\nhomicide. Manual strangulation is virtually impossible as\na suicide act, though one or two cases have been\ndescribed. The mechanism must of necessity be the\nsudden cardiac arrest type of death due to pressure on\n\n Page 31 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe carotid arteries, as it is obviously impossible to\nmaintain pressure long enough to cause florid asphyxial\nchanges with petechial cerebral anoxia would cause the\nhands to fall limply from the neck, with the return of\nconsciousness to the intended suicide.\"\n\n28.3 Dr. Modi in \"Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology\"\n\nTwenty-third edition offered expert opinion in this regard\nas under :\n\n\"(ii) Whether the Strangulation was Suicidal, Homicidal or\nAccidental. Suicidal strangulation is not very common,\nthough sometimes cases are met with. In these cases,\nsome contrivance is always made to keep the ligature\ntight after insensibility supervenes. This is done by\ntwisting a cord several times round the neck and then\ntying a knot, which is usually single and in front or at the\nside or back of the neck, by twisting a cord tightly by\nmeans of a stick, stone or some other solid material, or\nby tightening the ends of a cord by tying them to the\nhands or feet or to a peg in a wall or to the leg of bed. In\nsuch cases, injuries to the deep structures of the neck\nand marks of violence on other parts of the body are, as\na rule, absent. It is not possible for anyone to continue a\nfirm grasp of the throat after unconsciousness\nsupervenes, hence throttling by the fingers cannot\npossibly be suicidal. Binnar records the case of a woman,\naged 40 years, who committed suicide by throttling. She\nwas suffering from melancholia and was found dead,\ncrouched in her bed with both hands compressing her\nthroat; the elbows were supported on the knees, and the\nback leaned against the wall; there were marks of her\nfingernails on both sides of the throat.\"\n\n28.4 Taylor's Principles and Practice of Medical\nJurisprudence, Thirteenth Edition, 1984 by Keith Mant,\nVol. 1 stated at p. 282 that:\n\n\"asphyxia being a condition in which there is an\ninadequate supply of oxygen to the tissues. It may be\ndefined as a state in which the body lacks oxygen\nbecause of some mechanical interference with the\nprocess of breathing. At p. 283 it was further stated that\ncyanosis indicates the blue colour of the skin, mucous\nmembranes and of internal organs, notably spleen, liver\nand kidneys. The capillary dilation that accompanies a\n\n Page 32 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nreduction in oxygen tension promotes stasis and\ntherefore a vicious cycle of suboxygenation of the blood\ncommences. The return of blood to the heart is\ndiminished. The resultant impaired oxygenation leads to\nfurther capillary dilation, further stasis, with deepening\ncyanosis ...... Probably results from a combination of\nstasis and hypoxia. Fluid exudes into the tissue spaces.\n\nAt p. 286 it was also stated of the distinction between\nsuffocation and strangulation that conditions associated\nwith mechanical asphyxia include suffocation where the\ninterference with the process of breathing is at the level\nof the nose or mouth; strangulation where there is\ncompression of the neck, either by (a) the human hand\n(manual strangulation or throttling); (b) a ligature. In\nparagraph 6 he stated that in each of these categories\nthe obstructive process at the various level will result in\nthe development of the symptoms and the signs\nassociated with asphyxia previously described. At p. 287\nof general features of asphyxia, it was stated that the\nhead and face may show intense congestion and\ncyanosis with numerous petechiae. Blood exudes from\nthe mouth and nose. Blood tinged frothy fluid is present\nin air passages. Mucus may be found at the back of the\nmouth and throat. The lungs which are of particular\ninterest, usually show in addition to congestion of inter-\nalveolar capillaries, the presence of the oedema fluid in\nthe alveoli, areas of haemorrhage and collapse with\nintervening emphysema.......\n\nRegarding post-mortem appearances in strangulation at\np. 305 it was stated that a careful search in suitable\nmortuary conditions will usually reveal either external or\ninternal evidence of the area where the construction has\noccurred. At p. 306 the General Internal appearances, it\nis stated that internally the air passages contain fine\nfroth, often blood stained. The lungs are congested with\nsubpleural petechiae. Mycroscopically there is usually\nintense inter-alveolar congestion with haemorrhages of\nvarying size, fluid in the alveoli, areas of collapse and\nintervening areas of ruptured alveoli. The air passages\noften contain large areas of desquamated respiratory\ntype epithelium, red blood cells and fluid. The remaining\norgans show only congestive changes.\n\nThese conditions vary because of the circumstances that\n\n Page 33 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nthe assailants usually employ considerably more force\nthan would appear to be necessary to ensure that death\ntakes place. In general terms the mark of the neck is\nusually of the same width as the constricting object and\nthe depth is about half its diameter. Regarding finger-nail\nmarks it was stated that in manual strangulation the\nmarks of bruising will be on the front or sides of the neck,\nchiefly about the larynx and about it. Marks of pressure\nof fingers may, however be slight. The distribution of\nthese marks when present will vary with the\ncircumstances, and factors which will affect it include the\nrelative position of the assailant and victim, the manner\nof gripping the neck, being greater if the grip is shifted or\nhas been reapplied if the victim struggles, and the\ndegree of pressure. The solid tissues of the neck are of\nextreme importance in cases of suspected strangulation.\nThe solid structures comprise the hyoid bone and the\ncartilages forming the larynx. If the body is found to have\ndied with marks on the neck which indicate manual\nstrangulation and this is subsequently confirmed in the\nmortuary and laboratory the case must be regarded as a\nkilling by another person. It is inconceivable that anyone\ncould die from compression of the neck by his own hand\nbecause loss of consciousness would cause relaxation of\nthe constricting fingers.\n\n28.5 In Gradwohl's Legal Medicine, Second Edition in\nChapter 18 under the caption interpretation of Post-\nMortem Appearances in Death from Respiratory\nObstruction and Compression of the Neck, at p. 336 it\nwas stated that:\n\n\"Systemic and pulmonary congestion and dilatation of\nthe heart are classically described as signs of an\nasphyxial death. At p. 337 regarding hyoid bone it was\nstated that two mechanisms have been suggested in\nwhich the hyoid bone may be fractured: from direct\nlateral compression and from indirect violence. Direct\nlateral compression is one mechanism in manual\nstrangulation, when pressure is applied under the angles\nof the jaw.\"\n\n28.6 Medical jurisprudence by Raju and Jhala in Chapter\nXXV death from asphyxia and death from drowning at p.\n226 stated that:\n\n Page 34 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n\"the heart in asphyxia, specifically right chambers, is\nalways found full of dark venous blood. This is important\nto note as usually with death, blood disappears from the\nheart. The venous system of circulation, because of back\npressure, is always found distended with blood. The\nblood in heart and veins is not only dark blue but also\nliquid and remains liquid....... The internal organs and\nmucous membrane also present the general signs of\ncongestion...... This congestion has to be looked for and\nhas to be found in all cases of genuine asphyxia.\"\n\n28.7 In Medical jurisprudence and Toxicology, 13th Edn.\nby Modi at p. 155 it was stated that:\n\n\"in the case of constriction occurring at the end of\nexpiration the lungs are congested, oedematous and\nexude bloody serum on being cut, but are pale if\nconstriction occurred at the end of inspiration.... The\nright side of the heart, the pulmonary artery and venae\nand cavae are full of dark fluid blood, and the left side is\nempty. The abdominal organs are usually congested. The\nbrain is usually normal, it may be pale or congested\naccording to the mode of death. For symptoms at p. 158\nit was pointed out that if the wind pipe is compressed so\nsuddenly as to occlude the passage of air altogether, the\nindividual is rendered powerless to call for assistance,\nbecomes insensible and dies instantly. If the windpipe is\nnot completely closed, the face becomes cyanosed,\nbleeding occurs from the mouth, nostrils and ears, the\nhands are clenched and convulsions precede death. As in\nhanging, insensibility is very rapid, and death is quite\npainless. Regarding appearances on the neck he stated\nat p. 159 that if the fingers are used (throttling) marks of\npressure by the thumb and fingers are usually found on\neither side of the windpipe..... At p. 161, appearances\ndue to asphyxia it was stated that the face is swollen and\ncyanosed, and marked with petechiae. The eyes are\nprominent and open. In some cases they may be closed.\nThe conjunctive are congested, and the pupils are\ndilated. The lips are blue. Bloody foam escapes from the\nmouth and nostrils, and sometimes pure blood issues\nfrom the mouth, nose and ears, especially if great\nviolence has been used. Regarding internal appearances\nhe stated that the cornua of the hyoid bone may be\nfractured, also the cornua of thyroid cartilage but\nfracture of the cervical vertebrae is extremely rare. The\n\n Page 35 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nliver may show cloudy swelling and necrosis of the cells,\nif death has been delayed. The kidneys may show signs\nof nephritis, and on section the straight tubules may be\nfilled with debris of the blood corpuscles giving the\nappearances of reddishbrown markings.\"\n\n28.8 In H.W.V. Coxs Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology\nby Dr. Bernard Knight, 5th Edn. in Chapter 1 at p. 207 it\nwas stated that:\n\n\" strangulation is again a term which is not exact in itself,\nas there are several types of strangulation, mainly\nmanual strangulation and strangulation by a ligature.\nThough both these are similar, there are certain\ndifferences which are reflected in the pathological\nfindings. Strangulation is not by any means the same\nthing as asphyxia; in fact, a better name would be\n'pressure on the neck', which is used as an alternative\ndescription by some pathologists. Regarding manual\nstrangulation and the length of the time required to\ncause death at p. 213 it is stated that the length of time\nfor which pressure on the neck must be maintained to\ncause death is very variable, from zero seconds to\nseveral minutes. The statement regarding length of time\nhe stated that no dogmatic statement of time of two\nminutes or three minutes can be made. It is of little\npractical value as unless a witness is present, there is\nnever any way of determining such times. If, however,\nthere is physical evidence of pressure on the neck from\nbruises and haemorrhage, but no congestion whatsoever,\nthen it is certain that death was relatively rapid before\nthese classical signs appeared, due to reflex cardiac\narrest. Where death is due to cerebral anoxia from\ncompression of carotid vessels, then there is usually\ncyanosis and congestion due to simultaneous blockage of\nthe jugular venous system, though ignorance of time\nfactors make this statement of little practical value. In\nTaylor's Medical jurisprudence it was stated at p. 282\nthat the amount of pulmonary oedema can be used to\nestimate the time interval between injury and death. In\npractice it is seldom of value as it is common experience\nthat the changes described can develop with great\nrapidity when a patient dies after choking. At p. 285,\nasphyxia by violence, it is stated that if the breathing is\ninterfered with for a sufficient period of time\nunconsciousness and death will supervene.\"\n\n Page 36 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n21.

Ms. Thakkar, the learned APP also made available, for my\nperusal, few photographs of the deceased clicked by the police\nat the time of drawing of the inquest Panchnama. I am not an\nexpert in the field of forensic science or medicine, but a bare\nlook at the photographs of the deceased and the position of\nthe ligature mark would indicate, prima facie, that the case is\none of suicidal hanging. The ligature mark was present on the\nfront portion of the neck and it had gone to the back portion of\nthe ears on both the sides. There were abrasions on the\nmargins of the ligature mark.\n\n Page 40 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\n25. Strangulation is defined as the compression of the neck\nby a force other than hanging. The weight of the body has\nnothing to do with strangulation. The ligature strangulation is a\nviolent form of death, which results from constricting the neck\nby means of a ligature or by any other means without\nsuspending the body. When constriction is produced by the\npressure of the finger and palms upon the throat, it is called as\nthrottling. When strangulation is brought about by\ncompressing the throat with a foot, knee, bent elbow or some\nother solid substance, it is known as mugging (strangle hold).\nHanging is a form of death, produced by suspending the body\nwith a ligature around the neck, the constricting force being\nthe weight of the body or a part of the body weight. Hanging\ncan be defined as the ligature compression of the neck by the\nweight of one's own body due to suspension. In hanging, the\nligature mark is usually situated above the thyroid cartilage\nbetween the larynx and the chin, and is directed obliquely\nupward following the line of the mandible (lower jaw) and\ninterrupted at the back or may show an irregular impression of\na knot, reaching the mastoid processes behind the ears\ntowards the point of suspension. The mark may be found on or\nbelow the thyroid cartilage, especially in case of partial\nsuspension. It may also be circular if a ligature is first placed at\nthe nape of the neck and then its two ends are brought\nhorizontally forward and crossed, and carried upwards to the\npoint of suspension from behind the angle of the lower jaw on\neach side. The mark will be circular and oblique if a ligature is\npassed round the neck more than once. Near the position of\nthe knot, it is like an inverted \"V\" (see Modi's Medical\nJurisprudence and Taxicology 23rd Edition, pp.565, 568, 571\n\n Page 41 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nand 583). I must note that the most important difference\nbetween the hanging and strangulation by ligature is that in\nhanging the ligature mark is oblique, non-continuous placed\nhigh up in the neck between the chin and the larynx, the base\nof the groove or furrow being hard, yellow and parchment like,\nwhereas in strangulation by ligature, the ligature mark is\nusually horizontal or transverse continuous, round the neck,\nlow down in the neck below the thyroid, the base of the groove\nor furrow being soft and reddish.\n\n26. The theory as put forward by the prosecution that the\ndeceased was first strangulated to death and then hanged by\nthe accused persons from a ceiling fan with the aid of a\nDupatta just to make a show that the deceased committed\nsuicide, should be outright rejected. This does not even\nappear to be the case of the Investigating Agency. It is in the\ncourse of the submissions of the learned APP as well as the\nlearned counsel appearing for the original first informant that\nsuch theory has been put forward. There is a reason why this\ntheory, put forward, is absurd. If this theory has to be\naccepted, then there should have been two ligature marks on\nthe neck of the deceased. The photographs which are\nattached with the original papers of the investigation,\ncompletely rules out this theory because there is only one\nligature mark in the shape \"V\". There is no reference of two\nligature marks on the neck even in the postmortem report.\nBesides the same, the ligature mark which can be seen from\nthe photographs is not one completely encircling the neck and\nmost importantly, the ligature mark would be at a lower level if\nthe case is one of homicidal death. The ligature is almost over\nthe sub-mandibular region which is below the chin. This is very\n\n Page 42 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\napparent on bare look at the photographs. There are no signs\nof any scuffle worth the name. This also rules out the theory of\nhomicidal death. Once again, at the cost of repetition, I state\nthat the ligature mark is \"V\" shaped incomplete-oblique.\n\n27. There is one another pertinent feature which needs to be\nnoted from the photographs of the deceased. One eye is open\nand the another is closed. This is called Le Facie Sympathique.\nThis suggests hanging. Cyanosis is also not so evident. This\nalso points towards hanging. The postmortem report is\nabsolutely silent so far as Emphysematous bullae on the\nsurface of the lungs is concerned. The Emphysematous bullae\non the surface of the lungs was not found to be present. This is\nsuggestive of suicide by hanging.\n\n28. In any view of the matter, there is a considerable doubt\nas regards the fact whether the case is of homicidal\nstrangulation or suicidal strangulation. Strangulation, by itself,\ndoes not mean that the case is one of homicidal death. In the\nmedical jurisprudence, there is something called suicidal\nstrangulation. It is, altogether, different to say that the\nstrangulation should be assumed to be homicidal until the\ncontrary is proven to be more likely under the circumstances.\nStrangulation by a ligature is possible in a suicidal manner.\n\n29. I am inclined to give more weightage to the theory of\nsuicide not only keeping in mind the postmortem report and\nthe photographs but also considering the two statements of\nthe neighbours referred to above. The statement of Manibhai\nMadhavlal Maheriya and his son Ravikumar Manibhai Maheriya\nfurther reinforces the fact that the deceased committed\n\n Page 43 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nsuicide by hanging. Both these witnesses, in clear terms, have\nstated in their statements that on hearing the shouts, they\nreached at the house of the deceased and noticed that the\ndeceased had hanged herself with the aid of a Dupatta from a\nceiling fan. These two witnesses have stated that the other\npersons residing in the neighbourhood came at the house of\nthe deceased and cut the Duppata with a scissor and brought\nthe dead body of the deceased down.\n\n30. The learned APP as well as the learned counsel appearing\nfor the first informant vehemently submitted that at the stage\nof bail, the court should not give any benefit of doubt to the\naccused even if such doubt arises having regard to the\nmaterials on record. To put it in other words, the submission\non behalf of the State as well as the first informant is that this\nCourt should blindfoldedly accept the postmortem report at\nthis stage as a gospel truth and believe the case to be one of\nhomicidal death by strangulation. I do not find any merit in\nsuch a submission. First, the postmortem report itself is not\nclear and does not indicate only towards the theory of\nhomicidal death by strangulation. Ultimately, in the course of\nthe trial, the prosecution will be examining the expert\nwitnesses in this regard and the Trial Court will get the benefit\nof the opinion of the expert witnesses. However, that does not\nmean that at the stage of bail, the accused is not entitled to\nthe benefit of a strong reasonable doubt with regard to the\nnature of the death. The stage when the accused is asking for\na bail is also a stage where the principal of presumption of\ninnocence operates and if there is a reasonable doubt in the\nmind of the judge having regard to the materials on record,\nthen the benefit of such doubt should go to the accused even\n\n Page 44 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nat the stage of bail. There is no reason for me, at this stage, to\ndisbelieve the two statements of the independents witnesses,\nreferred to above. It is not even the case of the prosecution\nthat the two witnesses are partisan or were won over by the\naccused persons in any manner.\n\n31. In view of the above, I am inclined to exercise my\ndiscretion in favour of the applicants.\n\n32. In the result, the present application is allowed by\ndirecting that in the event of arrest of the applicants herein in\nconnection with the FIR registered at the Nadiad West Police\nStation vide I-CR No.48 of 2017, the applicants shall be\nreleased on bail on each of them furnishing a personal bond of\nRs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only) with one surety each\nof the like amount on the following conditions that they shall:\n\n (a) remain present at the concerned Police Station on\n 21st March, 2018 between 11.00 a.m. and 2.00 p.m.;\n\n (b) not directly or indirectly make any inducement,\n threat or promise to any person acquainted with the\n facts of the case so as to dissuade him/them from\n disclosing such facts to the court or to any police\n officer;\n\n (c) at the time of execution of bond, furnish the\n address to the Investigating Officer and the Court\n concerned and shall not change their residence till the\n final disposal of the case till further orders;\n\n (d) not leave India without the permission of the Court,\n and if having passport, shall deposit the same before\n the trial Court within a week;\n\n33. It goes without saying that any observations touching the\nmerits of the case are purely for the purpose of deciding the\n\n Page 45 of 46\n\n R/CR.MA/4178/2018 JUDGMENT\n\nquestion of grant of bail and shall not be construed as an\nexpression of the final opinion in the main matter.\n\n34. It is brought to my notice that the case is yet to be\ncommitted to the Court of Sessions. The court concerned is\ndirected to take steps at the earliest to commit the case to the\nCourt of Sessions. Once the case is committed to the Court of\nSessions, then the Sessions Court shall proceed to frame the\ncharge at the earliest and start with the recording of the\nevidence on day to day basis. The Registry is directed to\nforward a copy of this judgement to the Court, in which, the\ncommittal proceedings are pending so that necessary steps\ncan be taken in accordance with law. Rule is made absolute to\nthe aforesaid extent.\n\n Direct service is permitted.\n\n (J.B.PARDIWALA, J)\n\nVahid\n\n Page 46 of 46",

According to the\nlearned APP, the Medical Officer, with whom, the Investigating\nOfficer had a talk, prima facie, expressed his opinion that the\ncase is one of homicidal death and not suicidal. I inquired with\nthe learned APP whether there is anything in writing in this\nregard.. To put it in other words, whether the Investigating\nOfficer has obtained any such opinion from the concerned\nmedical officer in writing. The learned APP, after taking\ninstructions from the Investigating Officer, submitted that\nthere is no such opinion in writing. It was just an oral\ndiscussion between the Investigating Officer and the doctor\nconcerned. According to the learned APP, in such\ncircumstances, ultimately when time came to file the charge-\nsheet, the same was filed for the offence of murder."

Ordinary strangulation may be\ncaused accidentally, suicidally, or homicidally. The\nconstricting mark is usually found at a lower level on the\nneck than in hanging, but may be found at any level, and\nfrequently direct pressure is exerted upon the larynx. The\nmark more or less completely encircles the neck\ntransversely. In some cases it may be continuous, but in\nothers it may be invisible at some part of the neck. The\nnature of the ligature employed plays a prominent part in\nthis respect. The degree and character of injury to the\ndeeper tissues of the neck are dependent on the amount\nof violence used in the application of the ligature. The\nunderlying muscles frequently show some degree of\nextravasation, due to rupture of the capillary vessels. The\nlaryngeal cartilages and trachea are usually intact, but in\nsome cases, especially homicidal cases, fractures of\nthese structures are present. Fracture of the hyoid bone\nis unusual. The injuries in homicidal strangulation are\nusually more extensive than in accidental or suicidal\ncases, due to the fact that an assailant frequently uses\nmore force than is necessary to cause the death of his\nvictim. It is in such cases that extensive deep-seated\ninjury is likely to be found.

Strangulation is not by any means the same\nthing as asphyxia; in fact, a better name would be\n'pressure on the neck', which is used as an alternative\ndescription by some pathologists. Regarding manual\nstrangulation and the length of the time required to\ncause death at p. 213 it is stated that the length of time\nfor which pressure on the neck must be maintained to\ncause death is very variable, from zero seconds to\nseveral minutes. The statement regarding length of time\nhe stated that no dogmatic statement of time of two\nminutes or three minutes can be made. It is of little\npractical value as unless a witness is present, there is\nnever any way of determining such times. If, however,\nthere is physical evidence of pressure on the neck from\nbruises and haemorrhage, but no congestion whatsoever,\nthen it is certain that death was relatively rapid before\nthese classical signs appeared, due to reflex cardiac\narrest. Where death is due to cerebral anoxia from\ncompression of carotid vessels, then there is usually\ncyanosis and congestion due to simultaneous blockage of\nthe jugular venous system, though ignorance of time\nfactors make this statement of little practical value. In\nTaylor's Medical jurisprudence it was stated at p. 282\nthat the amount of pulmonary oedema can be used to\nestimate the time interval between injury and death. In\npractice it is seldom of value as it is common experience\nthat the changes described can develop with great\nrapidity when a patient dies after choking. At p. 285,\nasphyxia by violence, it is stated that if the breathing is\ninterfered with for a sufficient period of time\nunconsciousness and death will supervene.\""

The ligature strangulation is a\nviolent form of death, which results from constricting the neck\nby means of a ligature or by any other means without\nsuspending the body. When constriction is produced by the\npressure of the finger and palms upon the throat, it is called as\nthrottling. When strangulation is brought about by\ncompressing the throat with a foot, knee, bent elbow or some\nother solid substance, it is known as mugging (strangle hold).\nHanging is a form of death, produced by suspending the body\nwith a ligature around the neck, the constricting force being\nthe weight of the body or a part of the body weight. Hanging\ncan be defined as the ligature compression of the neck by the\nweight of one's own body due to suspension. In hanging, the\nligature mark is usually situated above the thyroid cartilage\nbetween the larynx and the chin, and is directed obliquely\nupward following the line of the mandible (lower jaw) and\ninterrupted at the back or may show an irregular impression of\na knot, reaching the mastoid processes behind the ears\ntowards the point of suspension. The mark may be found on or\nbelow the thyroid cartilage, especially in case of partial\nsuspension. It may also be circular if a ligature is first placed at\nthe nape of the neck and then its two ends are brought\nhorizontally forward and crossed, and carried upwards to the\npoint of suspension from behind the angle of the lower jaw on\neach side. The mark will be circular and oblique if a ligature is\npassed round the neck more than once.
