The factual matrix of the appeal is as under:\n\n It is transpired in the case of the prosecution that\n\naccused No.1 namely Harisha S/o. Govindaraju sported a\n\ngrudge against the deceased Anjinappa, who is the husband of\n\nCW.1 on the ground, he had some illicit intimacy with his wife\n\nand the accused persons with an intention to eliminate the\n\ndeceased Anjinappa, called the deceased behind the Mylara\n\nLingeshwara Temple situated at Cheelaganahally, in the guise\n\nof holding a party on 13.07.2014 at around 8.00 pm, wherein\n\nthe accused persons made him to consume excessive alcohol\n\nand threw the boulder on the head of the deceased to eliminate\n\nhim.\n\n 4. In pursuance of the act of the accused, the\n\ncomplainant filed the complaint and on the basis of the said\n\ncomplaint, the criminal law was set into motion by recording\n\nthe FIR as per Ex.P43. Subsequently, the Investigating Officer\n\ntaken the case for investigation and thorough investigation has\n\nbeen carried out and laid the charge sheet against the accused\n\n -4-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\npersons before the committal Court. Subsequently, the\n\ncommittal Court passed an order under \nSection 209\n of Cr.P.C\n\nand committed the case to the Court of Sessions for trial.\n\nSubsequently, the accused has been secured to face the trial in\n\nS.C.No.5011/2015. On hearing the learned Public Prosecutor\n\nfor the State and learned defence counsel for the accused in\n\nrespect of framing of charges against the accused, on prima\n\nfacie material found against them, the charges were framed\n\nagainst the accused for the offence punishable under \nSection\n\n302\n of IPC, wherein they declined the charges made against\n\nthem and claims to be tried.\n\n 5. Subsequent to framing of charges against the\n\naccused, the prosecution let in evidence of PW.1 to PW.39 and\n\ngot marked Exs.P1 to P.52 inclusive of Mo.1 to Mo.22.\n\nSubsequent to closure of the evidence on the part of the\n\nprosecution, the accused were subjected to examination as\n\ncontemplated under \nSection 313\n of Cr.P.C. for incriminating\n\nevidence adduced against them, whereby the accused denied\n\nthe truth of the evidence of the prosecution adduced so far.\n\n -5-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\n 6. Subsequent to recording of incriminating statement\n\nof the accused, wherein they have been called upon to enter\n\ninto the defence evidence as contemplated under \nSection 233\n\nof Cr.P.C., the accused did not come forward to adduce any\n\ndefence evidence on their parts.\n\n 7. Subsequent to closure of the entire evidence on the\n\npart of the prosecution, the trial Court heard the arguments\n\nadvanced by the learned Public Prosecutor and the defence\n\ncounsel and assessed the evidence of the prosecution adduced\n\nso far. The prosecution examined PW.4, who is said to be the\n\nwitness relating to the spot mahazar at Ex.P2 and also inquest\n\nmahazar at Ex.P4 conducted by the Investigating Officer in the\n\npresence of the aforesaid panch witness and this mahazar\n\nrelates to only correspondence the death as homicidal and the\n\ndeceased was eliminated by crushing with means of boulder\n\nthrown on him. However, PW.26 in her evidence stated that\n\nshe is the sister of the deceased and the deceased has gone\n\nalong with the accused persons for having party. This version of\n\nPW.26 corroborates with that of CW.2 and establishes strong\n\nlink in the case of the prosecution. Therefore, the trial Court\n\nhas come to the conclusion that the prosecution has proved the\n\n -6-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nguilt against the accused with beyond all reasonable about.\n\nFurther, the trial Court taken into consideration the evidence of\n\nPW.32, who being the FSL witness, stated in his evidence that\n\nhe has been assigned the duty to search the accused persons\n\nalong with CW.44 and during the course of the search of the\n\naccused persons, they have apprehended accused No.1 from\n\nhis house and produced him before the Investigating Officer\n\nand CW.44 has given a report as per Ex.P34. PW.36, being an\n\nofficial witness, stated that he has been assigned the duty of\n\nsearching of the absconding accused persons along with CW.40\n\nand during the course of the search of the absconding accused,\n\nthey have apprehended accused No.2 from Tumakuru bus\n\nstand and produced him before the Investigating Officer and\n\ngave the report as per Ex.P41. These are all the\n\ncorrespondence only to trace the accused persons and to\n\nproduce before the investigating officer.\n\n 8. PW.37 is the scribe of Ex.P42 relating to spot\n\nmahazar drawn in the presence by the Investigating officer and\n\nalso apprehended the accused persons, who showed the scene\n\nof crime where the incident has taken place in terms of murder\n\nof the deceased as per their voluntary statements and also\n\n -7-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nstated that the scribe of Exs.P11 and P12-Seizure mahazar,\n\nunder which the motor cycle and the blood stained cloths of the\n\naccused were seized by the Investigating Officer. PW.39, being\n\nan Investigating Officer, conducted the entire investigation and\n\nwherein, he has stated in his evidence relating to drew of the\n\nmahazar and also conducting mahazar in the presence of the\n\npanch witnesses. But the important aspect relating to\n\ncircumstances of motive of accused No.1 to commit the crime\n\nas alleged has not been established. PW.39, who is none other\n\nthan the Investigating Officers and wherein after completion of\n\nthe entire investigation, laid the charge sheet against the\n\naccused persons and whereby, the accused was facing trial for\n\nthe heinous offence under \nSection 302\n of IPC. However, the\n\ntrial Court has taken into consideration of the entire evidence\n\nlet in by the prosecution despite of several witnesses have been\n\ngiven in go by to the versions of their statements. Ex.P37 is the\n\npost mortem report, Ex.P38 is the FSL report, Ex.P39 is the\n\nreport received by PW.35 and inclusive of Ex.P42- spot\n\nmahazar shown by the accused. The voluntary statements of\n\naccused Nos.1 and 2 were recorded as per Exs.P46 and P47\n\nand based upon their voluntary statements, the Investigating\n\n -8-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nOfficer has taken up the case for investigation and also drew\n\nthe mahazar and subjected in P.F.No.108/2014 and\n\nP.F.No.109/2014 which marked at Exs.P50 and P51. The\n\nmaterial objects i.e., MO.1-cycle, MOs.6 and 7-two Whisky\n\nbottles, MO.11-Switch box, MO.12-Sigarette packet, MO.18-\n\nShirt of accused No.2, MO.19-pant of accused No.2, MO.20-\n\nshirt belongs to accused No.1, MO.21-pant belongs to accused\n\nNo.1 and MO.22-Motor cycle said to have been used by the\n\naccused persons were seized and also got marked on the part\n\nof the prosecution. However, the trial Court assessed the entire\n\nevidence on the part of the prosecution and arrived at the\n\nconclusion that the prosecution has proved the guilt against the\n\naccused. Accordingly, rendered conviction against the accused\n\nNo.1 for the offence punishable under \nSection 302\n of IPC,\n\nwhich is incorporated in the operative portion of the order and\n\nacquitted accused No.2 namely Anantharaju S/o\n\nSiddagangaiah. Whereas, under this appeal, accused No.1 is\n\nchallenging the judgment of conviction and order of sentence\n\nrendered by the trial Court against him.\n\n 9. It is contended by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant by referring the evidence of PW.21 that PW.21 has\n\n -9-\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nstated in his evidence that he did not know the motive factor\n\nfor committing the murder of the deceased. But the trial Court\n\ntaking into consideration the voluntary statement of the\n\naccused No.1, which marked at Ex.P.46. In the impugned\n\njudgment, the trial Court has specifically stated as per Ex.P46,\n\nthe voluntary statement of accused No.1 and the prosecution\n\ntheory, it was accused No.1 who threw the stone-MO.4 on the\n\nhead part of drunken deceased several times, resulting in\n\ncrushing injuries caused on the vital part of the head. Once\n\nagain act of accused No.1 is established. This is the way the\n\ntrial Court appreciated the evidence to arrive at the conclusion\n\nthat the prosecution has proved the guilt against the accused\n\nwith beyond all reasonable doubt.\n\n 10. In so far as \nSection 27\n of the Indian Evidence Act,\n\n1872 relating to how much of information have been received\n\nand to what extent, the information said to have been proved\n\nby the prosecution against the accused persons, the trial Court\n\nfailed to understand the position of law relating to \nSection 27\n of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and more so, committed serious\n\nerror while appreciating the evidence on hand and so also role\n\nof accused No.1 and accused No.2. Though accused No.1 was\n\n - 10 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nsubjected to cross-examination, nothing has been explained in\n\nrespect of contents of Ex.P11 in his incriminating statement\n\nrecorded under Section 313 of Cr.C.P. The trial Court framed\n\nfour questions relating to the evidence of PW.1, PW.3 and\n\nPW.20, who are the non-official witnesses in the case and the\n\naccused has answered all the questions and declined the truth\n\nof evidence of the prosecution adduced so far. But, the trial\n\nCourt has not properly appreciated the evidence and also the\n\nscope of \nSection 313\n of Cr.P.C. and absolutely failed to\n\nappreciate the case on hand in a proper perspective. On this\n\npremise alone, it requires intervention and seeks to set aside\n\nthe conviction judgment rendered by the trial Court against\n\naccused No.1.\n\n 11. The second limb of the argument advanced keeping\n\nin view the evidence of PW.30-Kiran Kumar, the photographer.\n\nNothing worthwhile has been elicited from PW.30 by the\n\nprosecution, even though he has been subjected to cross-\n\nexamination. Subsequently, he was treated as hostile. The\n\nprosecution even failed to prove the contents at Exs.P13 to\n\nP15. In spite of which, the trial Court erroneously appreciated\n\nthe evidence and rendered the conviction judgment against\n\n - 11 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\naccused No.1. But the case against accused No.2 was ended in\n\nacquittal even though the role of accused Nos.1 and 2 founds to\n\nbe similar.\n\n 12. The last limb of the argument advanced is that\n\nthough the prosecution let in several witnessed by subjecting\n\nthem to examination, collected plethora of materials inclusive\n\nof the charge sheet, no witnesses come forwarded to adduce\n\nthe evidence relating to charges made against the accused\n\npersons. But the entire investigation carried by the\n\ninvestigating authorities is nothing but the preparatory\n\ninvestigation. Therefore, in this appeal, it requires intervention\n\nand re-appreciation of the evidence and so also re-visiting the\n\nimpugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence\n\nrendered against accused No.1 namely Harisha, if not\n\nintervened, certainly the accused will be the sufferer and also\n\ncausing miscarriage of justice would occur.\n\n 13. The prosecution has miserably failed to establish\n\nthe guilt against the accused regarding his involvement in the\n\ncommission of the offence. The trial Court, without appreciating\n\nthe evidence on record, rendered conviction judgment against\n\n - 12 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\naccused No.1. Therefore, it requires for consideration of the\n\ngrounds urged in this appeal akin to that evidence and also to\n\nconcentration on the exhibited documents which are marked on\n\nthe part of the prosecution. But the trial Court has seriously\n\nerred in brushing aside the material omissions i.e., the material\n\nwhich has secured by the Investigating Officer during the\n\ncourse of the investigation including the charge sheet.\n\nTherefore, in this appeal, it requires intervention relating to\n\nre-appreciation of the evidence and also revisiting the\n\nimpugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence\n\nrendered by the trial Court. On this premise, the learned\n\ncounsel prays for allowing the appeal and setting aside the\n\njudgment of conviction and order of sentence rendered by the\n\ntrial Court in S.C.No.5011/2015 dated 28.02.2017.\n\nConsequently, acquit accused No.1 for the offence punishable\n\nunder \nSection 302\n of IPC.\n\n 14. On controverted to the arguments advanced by the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant, Sri H.S.Shankar, learned\n\nHCGP taken us through the evidence let in by the prosecution\n\nmainly, commission of the offence on 13.07.2014 and accused\n\nNos.1 and 2 said to be apprehended by the Investigating\n\n - 13 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nAgency on 18.07.2014. The accused persons committed the\n\nmurder of the deceased-Anjanappa, who is the husband of\n\nCW.1 on the ground that he had some illicit intimacy with the\n\nwife of accused No.1. The accused took the deceased in his\n\nmotor cycle Mylara Lingeshwara Temple situated at\n\nCheelaganahall in the guise of holding the party among them.\n\nAccordingly, on 13.07.2014 at around 8.00 p.m., the accused\n\npersons made the deceased to consume excessive alcohol and\n\nthrew the boulder on the head of the deceased. As a resultant,\n\nhe sustained injuries and lost his breath at the spot itself.\n\nThese are all the evidence let in by the prosecution and more\n\nso the post-mortem at Ex.P37 indicating the injuries inflicted\n\nover the person of the deceased, Ex.P38-the FSL report and\n\nEx.P40-sketch relating to the scene of crime drawn by the\n\nconcerned Authority, where the accused committed the murder\n\nof the deceased. Ex.P42-the spot mahazar, which shown by the\n\naccused and drawn by the Investigation Officer. Exs.P5, P6, P7\n\nand P8 are the statement of PW.6 to PW.9 respectively relating\n\nto the inquest proceedings held over the dead body and Ex.P9-\n\nseizure mahazar dated 14.07.2014. Ex.P12-another seizure\n\nmahazar drawn by the Investigation Officer in the presence of\n\n - 14 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nthe panch witnesses. These are all the mahazars have been\n\nconducted by the Investigation Officer and also secured the\n\nmaterials during the course of the investigation and so also\n\nrecorded the voluntary statements of accused Nos.1 and 2 as\n\nper Exs.P46 and Ex.P47 and two photographs at Ex.P48 and\n\nEx.P49. These are all the evidence finds place on the part of the\n\nprosecution to prove the guilt against the accused persons. But\n\nmere because several witnesses have been turned around to\n\ntheir statements, it cannot be said that the entire case of the\n\nprosecution has to be thrown out. However, the evidence of\n\nPW.3-Siddaraju and PW.31-Dilip has been appreciated by the\n\ntrial Court while rendering the conviction judgment. Whereas\n\nPW.39, being the Investigation Officer, laid the charge sheet\n\nagainst the accused after completion of the entire investigation\n\ndone by him thoroughly and the same has been appreciated by\n\nthe trial court while rendering the conviction judgment for the\n\noffence punishable under \nSection 302\n of IPC insofar as accused\n\nNo.1. But the case against accused No.2 was ended in\n\nacquittal. Mere because, accused No.2 was acquitted, it cannot\n\nbe the ground otherwise justifiable reason to seek intervention\n\nin the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence\n\n - 15 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nand to acquit accused No.1. On this premise, the learned HCGP\n\nfor State seeks dismissal of this appeal even on merits as this\n\naccused has committed the murder of the deceased by\n\ndropping the stone boulder on the vital part of the head and\n\ncaused some injuries which indicates in the post-mortem report\n\nissued by the doctor, who conducted autopsy over the dead\n\nbody.\n\n 15. It is in this background of the contention made by\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellant and so also the learned\n\nHCGP for the State, the evidence of prosecution witnesses very\n\nmuch required to arrive at a proper conclusion. This appeal is\n\nnothing but continuity of the proceedings and more so, it\n\nrequires re-appreciation of the evidence relating to marking of\n\nthe documents and also role of each one of the accused.\n\nWhereas, accused No.1 sported a grudge against the deceased-\n\nAnjinappa, who is the husband of CW.1, on the ground that the\n\ndeceased had some illicit intimacy with his wife. Therefore,\n\naccused No.1 had conspiracy to eliminate the deceased to clear\n\ntheir way out. Accordingly, on 13.07.2014 at around 8.00 p.m.,\n\nthe accused took the deceased to hold a party and made him to\n\nconsume excessive alcohol and thereafter, the accused persons\n\n - 16 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\ndropped the stone boulder on the head part of the deceased\n\nand as a resultant, he lost his breath.\n\n 16. PW.1, who is the complainant and also the author\n\nof the complaint and based upon her complaint, the criminal\n\nlaw was set into emotion. No doubt, she is not an eye\n\nwitnesses to the incident narrating in her complaint, but she\n\nknown about the illicit relationship of the wife of accused No.1\n\nwith her husband, who is the deceased. Thus, she has stated in\n\nher evidence that the incident took place in the night of\n\n14.07.2014, it is hereby clarified as in between 13.07.2014 and\n\n14.07.2014. As per the theory of the prosecution, the\n\ncomplainant's husband was murder by the accused persons and\n\nit is the domain vested with the prosecution to establish the\n\nguilt against the accused by facilitating the worthwhile evidence\n\ninclusive of cogent, corroborative and so also acceptable\n\nevidence that the accused persons have committed the murder\n\nof the deceased as narrated in the complaint made by PW.1\n\nbefore the Investigating Agency. However, PW.1 deposed that\n\nshe has not seen the deceased accompanying with the accused\n\npersons behind the Mylara Lingeshwara Temple, but she has\n\ncategorically stated in her evidence that the deceased told her\n\n - 17 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nthat he was proceeding with the accused persons to that places\n\nto hold some party. It is clear that she has seen the deceased\n\nalive lost when he had told her that he would be in the\n\ncompany of the accused persons in order to holding a party on\n\n13.07.2014 at 8.00 p.m. But for the offence under \nSection 302\n\nof IPC, it is the domain vested with the prosecution to prove\n\nthe guilt against the accused by facilitating the worthwhile\n\nevidence and also the motive factors and so also the intention\n\nof the accused to eliminate the deceased. But the prosecution\n\nhas let in evidence by subjecting several witnesses and the\n\nmajor witnesses, who have been examined, turned around and\n\nno witnesses come forwarded to adduce the evidence in order\n\nto secure the conviction for the offence under \nSection 302\n of\n\nIPC. But strangely, the case against accused No.2 was ended in\n\nacquittal of the offence under \nSection 302\n of IPC even though\n\naccused Nos.1 and 2 were facing trial for the same offences\n\nand the evidence has been let in by the prosecution in order to\n\nprove the guilt against the accused. Even PW.1 had been\n\nsubjected to examination on the part of the prosecution, her\n\nevidence has not been finds place to corroborate with any other\n\nstrong evidence to prove that the accused persons have\n\n - 18 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\ncommitted the murder of the deceased. Accused No.2, who is\n\nthe cousin of CW.1, does not want his cousin to become widow\n\nby killing the deceased. In fact, no one has spoken about his\n\nmotive or any act as finds place in the theory of the\n\nprosecution. PW.1 has stated in her evidence about the murder\n\nof her husband. One Prabhu S/o Ventakaswamy was cited as\n\nCW.2. PW.2-One Dasakka was cited as CW.3 and in her\n\nevidence, she has deposed that she has not seen the dead\n\nbody of the deceased. CW.4, who cited as a witness, went to\n\nthe house and passed on the message to CW.1 about the death\n\nof her husband. These are all the witnesses examined on the\n\npart of prosecution, but there is no corroborative evidence or\n\nany strong evidence let in by the prosecution to prove the guilt\n\nagainst the accused to secure conviction for the offence under\n\nSection 302\n of IPC.\n\n 17. PW.5 said to have been examined relating to the\n\ninquest proceedings held over the dead body of the deceased\n\nwhich marked as Ex.P4. Though this witness has turned around\n\nto the contents made in the inquest proceedings, subsequent to\n\ntreated as a hostile, this witness has been examined on the\n\npart of prosecution and nothing worthwhile has been elicited to\n\n - 19 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nbelieve the version of the prosecution to arrive at a proper\n\nconclusion.\n\n 18. As at a cursory glance of the entire evidence which\n\nhas let in by the prosecution i.e., PW.13 to PW.29, it is clear\n\nthat they did not support the case of the prosecution.\n\nConsequently, the contradictory statements at Exs.P16 to P30,\n\nP33, P35 and P36 have been got marked. However, their\n\nevidence are contradictory to the contents made in Ex.P1 i.e.,\n\nthe complaint inclusive of the contents made in spot mahazar\n\nof Ex.P2 and seizure mahazars at Exs.P9 and P12. These are all\n\nthe mahazars said to have been conducted by the Investigation\n\nOfficer during the course of the investigation.\n\n 19. Keeping in view the evidence of prosecution\n\nwitnesses and so also the contention made by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant and even counter argument advanced\n\nby the learned HCGP for the State relating to the conviction\n\njudgment of accused No.1 which has been challenged under\n\nthese appeals are concerned, it is relevant to refer the\n\njudgment rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in a\n\ncase of Lalit Kumar Sharma and others vs.\n\n - 20 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nSuperintendent and Remembrances of Legal Affairs,\n\nGovernment of West Bengal reported in AIR 1989 SC 2134\n\nwhereas in this judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\n\naddressed the scope and also issue relating to the power of an\n\nappellate court to review evidence in appeals against acquittal\n\nis as extensive as its powers in appeals against convictions, but\n\nthe appellate court should be slow in interfering with the orders\n\nof acquittal.\n\n 20. Even though similar offences are lugged against the\n\naccused persons, the trial Court acquitted accused No.2 and\n\nconvicted accused No.1 for the offence under \nSection 302\n of\n\nIPC. However, the domain vested with the prosecution to prove\n\nthe guilt against the accused by facilitating the worthwhile\n\nevidence, cogent, consistent and corroborative evidence. But in\n\nthe instant case, there is clouds of doubt and the same does\n\nnot repose confident to arrive at the conclusion. Therefore, it is\n\nappropriate to refer the provision of \nSection 134\n of the Indian\n\nEvidence Act, 1872 wherein the plurality of witness concept has\n\nbeen referred. But, in the matter of appreciation of the\n\nevidence, it is not the number of witnesses but quality of their\n\nevidence which is important, as there is no requirement in law\n\n - 21 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nof evidence that any particular number of witnesses is to be\n\nexamined to prove/disprove a fact. It is time honoured\n\nprinciple, that the evidence must be weighed and not counted.\n\nThe test is whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent,\n\ncredible and trustworthy or otherwise. The legal system has\n\nlaid emphasis on value provided by each witnesses, rather than\n\nthe multiplicity or plurality of witnesses. It is quality and not\n\nquantity, which determines the adequacy of evidence as has\n\nbeen provided under \nSection 134\n of the Evidence Act. This\n\nscope of the said provision has been in greater extent\n\naddressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\n\nLaxmibai (Dead) through LRs. vs. Bhagwanthbura\n\n(Dead) through LRs. reported in AIR 2013 SC 1204.\n\n 21. It is the domain vested with the prosecution\n\nrelating to requirement of acceptable evidence and the number\n\nof evidence does not arise. The law of evidence does not\n\nrequire any particular number of witnesses to be examined in\n\nproof of a given fact. However, faced with the testimony of the\n\nsingle witness, the court may classify the oral testimony of a\n\nsingle witness, the court may classify the oral testimony in to\n\nthree categories namely (i) wholly reliable, (ii) wholly\n\n - 22 -\n\n \nNC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nunreliable, and (iii) neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.\n\nIn the first two categories there may be no difficulty in\n\naccepting or discarding the testimony of the single witness. The\n\ndifficulty arises in the third category of cases. The court has to\n\nbe circumspect and has to look for corroboration in material\n\nparticulars by reliable testimony, direct of circumstantial before\n\nacting upon testimony of single witness. This issue was in\n\ngreater extent addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\n\nIndia in the case of \nLallu Manjhi vs. State of Jharkhand\n\nreported in AIR 2003 SC 854.\n\n 22. In the instant case, it requires to refer \nSection 3\n of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872 relating to the scope of (i)\n\n\"proved\". - A fact is said to be proved when, after considering\n\nthe matters before it, the Court either believe it to exist, or\n\nconsiders its existence so probable that a prudent man ought,\n\nunder the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the\n\nsupposition that it exists and (ii) \"Disproved\". - A fact is said to\n\nbe disproved when, after considering the matters before it, the\n\nCourt either believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-\n\nexistence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the\n\n - 23 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\ncircumstances of the particular case, to act upon the\n\nsupposition that it does not exist.\n\n \n23. In the instant case, even though last seen theory\n\nrequires corroboration, the accused persons cannot be\n\nconvicted solely on the evidence of even last seen theory\n\ntogether with the deceased. But in instant case, the prosecution\n\nwas failed to establish the guilt against the accused even the\n\nlast seen theory. It was addressed by the Hon'ble Supreme\n\nCourt of India in a case of \nNavaneethakrishnan vs. The\n\nState\n by inspector of Police reported in AIR 2018 SC 2027.\n\n 24. In totality of the circumstances of the entire case\n\nand so also role of accused No.1 wherein alleged to committed\n\nthe murder of the deceased by securing him to attend party, it\n\nwas depicted in the complaint and even it was clearly depicted\n\nin the theory of the prosecution as well as the material which\n\nhas been secured by the Investigation Officer during the course\n\nof the investigation. But the motive factor thereby meaning of\n\nmotive is a thing which is primarily known to the accused\n\nthemselves and it is not possible for the prosecution to explain\n\nwhat actually prompted or excited them to commit the\n\n - 24 -\n\n \nNC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\nparticular crime. This factor was also decided by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India in a greater extend by rendering a\n\njudgment of \nBipin Kumar Mondal v. State of West Bengal\n\nreported in AIR 2010 SC 3638. Motive in a circumstantial\n\nevidence - in a case of circumstantial evidence, the evidence\n\nindicating the guilt of the accused becomes untrustworthy and\n\nunreliable. Because most often it is only the perpetrator of the\n\ncrime alone who has knowledge of the circumstances that\n\nprompted into adopt a certain course of acts, leading to the\n\ncommission of the crime. Therefore, if the evidence on record\n\nsuggest sufficient/necessary motive to commit the crime. It\n\nmay be conceived that the accused has committed the same. It\n\nis the domain vested with the prosecution to proven the guilt\n\nagainst the accused in all material ingredients and also the\n\ningredients of the offences under \nSection 302\n of IPC 1860.\n \nBut\n\nis relevant to refer the judgment of \nSampath Kumar vs.\n\nInspector of Police, Krishnagiri\n reported in AIR 2012 SCC\n\n1249 wherein, it held that, motive may be an important\n\ncircumstance in a case based on circumstantial evidence but\n\ncannot take the place of conclusive proof.\n\n - 25 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\n \n25. As far as the instant case, it requires to be\n\nattending when motive is not sine qua non where the ocular\n\nevidence is a very clear and convince and the role of the\n\naccused persons in the crime stands clearly established.\n\nEstablishment of motive is not a sine qua non for proving the\n\nprosecution case. It issue was extensively addressed by the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Yunis alias\n\nKariya Vs. State of M.P.\n reported the AIR 2003 SCC 539.\n\n 26. These are all the reliances rendered by the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court of India. Despite of which, the trial Court had\n\nrendered the conviction judgment for the offence punishable\n\nunder \nSection 302\n of IPC in so far as accused No.1. But, insofar\n\nas accused No.2 is concerned, the case was ended in acquittal.\n\nBut the role of accused No.1 and accused No.2 is concerned,\n\nthe evidence has to be independently assessed. But the case\n\nagainst the co-accused No.2 was ended in acquittal even\n\nthough, he was facing trial along with accused No.1. The\n\nprosecution was failed to establish the guilt against accused\n\nNo.2 and consequently, the similar benefit shall be extended to\n\naccused No.1.\n\n - 26 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\n 27. As at the cursory glance of the entire evidence,\n\nwhich are facilitated by the prosecution in toto and also in\n\ntotality of the case, as a prudent man can be inferred. But in\n\nthe instant case, we have assessed the evidence in entirety and\n\ncome to the conclusion that the trial Court has not appreciated\n\nthe evidence in a proper perspective and misdirected the\n\nevidence. Therefore, in this appeal it requires re-appreciation of\n\nthe evidence and also revisiting the impugned judgment of\n\nconviction rendered against accused No.1. Therefore, in the\n\ninstant case, considering that the grounds urged by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant are having some substances, we are\n\nof the opinion to interfere with the impugned judgment of\n\nconviction rendered by the trial Court against accused No.1\n\nrequires interference. In view of the aforesaid reasons and\n\nfindings, we are of opinion that accused No.1 deserves to be\n\nacquittal. Consequently, the appeal requires to be allowed even\n\non merits.\n\n 28. Accordingly, we have to proceed to pass the\n\nfollowing:\n\n - 27 -\n\n NC: 2023:KHC:23186-DB\n\n CRL.A No. 780 of 2017\n\n ORDER\n\n i. The appeal preferred by the appellant/accused\n No.1 under \nSection 374(2)\n of Cr.P.C. is hereby\n allowed.\n\n ii. Consequently, the judgment of conviction and\n order of sentence rendered by the trial Court in\n S.C.No.5011/2015 dated 28.02.2017, in\n respect of accused No.1 namely Harisha S/o\n Govindaraju, is hereby setting aside.\n\n iii. Consequent upon setting aside the judgment of\n conviction stated supra, the appellant/accused\n i.e., Harisha S/o Govindaraju, is hereby\n acquitted for the offences punishable under\n \nSections 302\n of IPC, 1860.\n\n iv. The appellant/accused No.1, who is the\n appellant herein, is on bail. Therefore, if any\n bail bond has been executed by the aforesaid\n accused, the same shall stand cancel.\n\n v. If the appellant/accused No.1 has deposited\n any fine amount, the same shall be ordered to\n be refunded to him on due identification.\n\n Sd/-\n\n JUDGE\n\n Sd/-\n\n JUDGE\nVM\n\nList No.: 1 Sl No.: 8",
