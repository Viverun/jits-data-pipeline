JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT\n\nJUDGMENT\n\n1. Vide the present petition, the petitioner seeks direction thereby\n\nquashing and setting aside impugned orders dated 15.11.2017 and\n\n13.09.2017. Consequently, declare the petitioner to be entitled to the benefit\n\nof judgments in\nGovernment of Nct of Delhi and Ors. vs. All India Young\n\nLawyers Association (Registered) and another\n: (\n2009) 14 SCC 49 and P.\n\nRamakrishnam Raju vs. Union of India & Ors.\ndecided in Supreme Court\n\nin W.P.(C) 521/2002 and further direct the respondents to add ten years\n\npractice of the petitioner as an Advocate at Bar, towards qualifying service.\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 1 of 30\n\nConsequently, revised the Pension and Gratuity of the petitioner and arrears\n\nbe calculated and disbursed to the petitioner by issuing of a revised PPO,\n\nincluding incorporation of Family Pension.\n\n2. The brief facts of this case are that the petitioner is a Law Graduate\n\nand was enrolled as an Advocate with Bar Counsel of Delhi on 12.10.1984.\n\nThe petitioner was appointed as Member (Judicial) in Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal, Principal Bench on 12.10.2000. At the time of\n\nappointment, the petitioner was governed by CAT (Salaries and Allowances\n\nand Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 1985. The petitioner was\n\ntreated at par with the Additional Secretary to the Government of India, but\n\nin case of no express provision regarding conditions of service at par with\n\nsecretary to the Government of India. The formula for Pension on\n\ncompletion of two years of service was at a rate of ₹4,716/- per annum for\n\neach completed year of service and the Pension was fixed as per Part III of\n\nSchedule of High Court Judges Conditions of Service Rules, 1954. The\n\nPension formula was amended on 22.07.2009 by replacement of per annum\n\namount for pension as ₹14,532/- per annum w.e.f. 01.01.2006. Copy of\n\nService Rules are at annexure P-3 (Colly).\n\n3. Further case of the petitioner is that he was initially appointed for a\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 2 of 30\n\nterm of five years and was extended for another term of five years. The\n\npetitioner demitted office on completion of his tenure on 10.12.2010. The\n\npension of the petitioner on the formula as per 2009 Rules was fixed as\n\n₹12,110/- per month.\nIn a PIL filed on behalf of the Bar regarding addition\n\nof practice of ten years at Bar to the direct recruits to Delhi Higher Judicial\n\nService was laid at rest by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of\nAll India\n\nYoung Lawyers Association\n(Supra) by holding that weightage of practice\n\nat Bar while computing pension and other retiral benefits would attract the\n\nbest talent. Accordingly, ten years practice at Bar has been given weightage\n\nto direct recruits in Judicial Service. In year 2006, an amendment was\n\ncarried out in\nA.T. Act, 1985\neffective from 19.02.2007, whereby the service\n\nconditions of members of the Central Administrative Tribunal were brought\n\nat par with that of High Court Judges.\n\n4. Mr. Shankar Raju, the petitioner in person submitted that the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in a Constitution Bench Judgment in L.Chandrakumar vs.\n\nUOI: 1997 (3) SCC 261 held the status of Central Administrative Tribunal\n\nas Court of first instance and also upheld the eligibility of an Advocate to be\n\nappointed as Member (Judicial) to be same as eligibility to the High Court\n\nJudge under\nArticle 217\nof the Constitution of India. This qualification of\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 3 of 30\n\nten years practice at Bar has not been altered as a qualification for a Member\n\n(Judicial) under the\nA.T. Amended Act, 2006\ni.e., post 19.02.2007.\n\n5. The pension of a Member (Judicial), irrespective of the appointment\n\nunder Unamended or\nAmended A.T. Act, 1985\nis fixed on the basis of a\n\ncommon formula i.e.,\nUnder Part III of First Schedule of High Court Judges\n\n(Salaries & Conditions of Service) Act, 1954\n. This has been admitted by the\n\nDOPT in an information furnished to Ex-Judicial Member, CAT, Sh. J. K.\n\nKaushik on 08.04.2010 under\nRTI Act, 2005\nwhich is at Annexure P-5\n\n(Colly). The petitioner demitted office on completion of tenure of ten years\n\non 10.12.2010. The pension was fixed on the basis of formula adopted by\n\nthe DOPT reckoning only ten years service of the petitioner. Before the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court in various Writ Petitions including of\nP. Rama\n\nKrishnam Raju\n(supra), a question as to addition of ten years practice for the\n\npurposes of pension to the High Court Judges appointed from Bar was\n\ndeliberated and adjudicated.\n\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court while discussing\n\nvarious provisions of Conditions of Service also relied upon the decision in\n\nAll India Young Lawyer Association\n(Supra).\n\nIn this furtherance, the\n\nHon'ble Court discussed three tier judicial system under the Constitution\n\nand discussed the case of Advocates, being Members of the Bar to join\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 4 of 30\n\nHigher Judicial Services and on retirement get benefit of ten years addition\n\nto their service and observed the following in paras 19 and 24 of the\n\nJudgment in\nP. Rama Krishna Raju\n(Supra):-\n\n\"19) The Explanation (aa) appended to\nArticle 217(2)\nof\nthe Constitution of India envisages that, \"in computing\nthe period during which a person has been an advocate of\na High Court, there shall be included any period during\nwhich the person has held judicial office or the officer of\na member of a tribunal or any post, under the Union or a\nState, requiring special knowledge of law after he became\nan Advocate.\" The explanation thus treats the experience\nof an Advocate at the Bar and the period of judicial office\nheld by him at par.\n\n24) when persons who occupied the Constitutional Office\nof Judge, High Court retire, there should not be any\ndiscrimination with regard to the fixation of their\npension. Irrespective of the source from where the Judges\nare drawn, they must be paid the same pension just as\nthey have been paid same salaries and allowances and\nperks as serving Judges. Only practicing Advocates who\nhave attained eminence are invited to accept judgeship of\nthe High Court. Because of the status of the office of High\nCourt Judge, the responsibilities and duties attached to\nthe office, hardly any advocates of distinction declines the\noffer. Though it may be a great financial sacrifice to a\nsuccessful lawyer to accept Judgeship, it is the desire to\nserve the society and the high prestige attached to the\noffice and the respect the office commands that propel a\nsuccessful lawyer to accept judgeship. The experience\nand knowledge gained by a successful lawyer at the Bar\ncan never be considered to be less important from any\npoint of view vis-a-vis the experience gained by a judicial\nofficer. If the service of a judicial officer is counter for\nfixation of pension, there is no valid reason as to why the\nexperience at Bar cannot be treated as equivalent for the\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 5 of 30\n\nsame purpose.\n\n6. Mr. Raju, further submitted that though the issue pertain to Judges\n\nappointed in High Court from the Bar, the Question of Law i.e., ratio\n\ndecidendi was regarding counting of service of a Judicial Officer appointed\n\non direct recruitment basis and counting of experience at Bar, being\n\nequivalent was found to be discriminatory in violation of\nArticle 14\nand\nof the constitution. The concept of One Rank One Pension was treated as a\n\nmust norm.\n\n7. The petitioner in person further submitted that the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal was constituted under\nArticle 323A\nof the\n\nConstitution of India. The eligibility of a Member (Judicial) appointed from\n\nthe Bar was Mutatis-Mutandis as laid down for High Court Judges under\n\nArticle 217\nof the Constitution of India. The DOPT vide communication\n\ndated 12.11.2015 addressed to CAT regarding pensionary benefits to\n\nMembers (Judicial) coming from Bar, in the light of judgment of the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court consulted the Department of Expenditure and\n\nJustice and forwarded comments to the CAT for furnishing requested\n\ninformation. Copy of the communication is at Annexure P-7. The CAT\n\nfurnished information to the DOPT on 11.01.2016 inter alia, contending that\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 6 of 30\n\nprior to the amendment of the\nA.T. Act\n, the pension was calculated under\n\nCAT (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1985 and after the amendment, at par\n\nwith High Court Judges under Part III of the First Schedule of Act of 1954.\n\nIt was further informed that in 2009,\nCAT Act\nwas further amended to raise\n\nthe amount of pension and recommended addition of ten years practice as\n\nqualifying service, in case of Sh. N. Dharmadan, Retired Member (Judicial)\n\nprior to 19.02.2007 vide Annexure P-8. The petitioner made a representation\n\nto the DOPT on 15.02.2016 for fixation of pension reckoning Full Pension,\n\nas per DOPT OM dated 10.12.2009 as per High Court judges Act, 1954 vide\n\nAnnexure P-9 (Colly). The petitioner, by way of a representation dated\n\n07.03.2016 has sought extension of benefit of judgment in\nP. Rama Krishna\n\nRaju and All India Young Lawyers Association\n's case on various legal\n\ngrounds vide Annexure P-10. The Family Pension was introduced in CAT\n\nand accordingly, a revised PPO was issued to the petitioner on 06.06.2016\n\nvide Annexure P-11. It is further submitted that the CAT forwarded the\n\nrepresentation of Member (Judicial) appointed from Bar for addition of ten\n\nyears service as qualifying service to the DOPT. An information sought by\n\nthe petitioner under\nRTI Act, 2005\ndivulged that a favourable note for\n\naddition of ten years practice to the petitioner, being pre-appointee of\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 7 of 30\n\n19.02.2007 was sent to DOPT. Since matter pertaining to the same issue was\n\nsub-judice, before Hon'ble Kerala High Court, the DOPT informed the\n\npetitioner on 06.09.2016 that the matter is under consideration in\n\nconsultation with Departments of Justice & Expenditure. The above\n\ndocuments are at Annexure P-12 (Colly).\n\n8. It is further submitted that Retired Member (Judicial) from Bar Sh. N.\n\nDharmadan filed W.P.(C) 30170/2014 before the Hon'ble High Court of\n\nKerala at Ernakulam. The said petition was disposed of vide order dated\n\n26.10.2016 on the statement of Central Government that the grievance of the\n\npetitioner therein, is being considered, to pass orders on the claim of the\n\npetitioner and other similarly situated persons. The said order is at annexure\n\nP-13.\n\n9. The CAT in various communications to the DOPT forwarded the\n\nrepresentation for Member (Judicial) appointed from Bar. DOPT vide its\n\ncommunication dated 02.06.2017 asked for particulars of Member appointed\n\nfrom Bar post 19.02.2007 only and this information was sent by the CAT,\n\nincluding the name of the petitioner. A communication from CAT dated\n\n10.07.2017 and 25.08.2017 included the name of the petitioner in the list on\n\nthe ground that though the DOPT has sought information regarding\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 8 of 30\n\nMembers appointed from 19.02.2007 to 31.05.2017, but the petitioner is also\n\nentitled to addition of ten years practice, as they are drawing Pension as per\n\nHigh Court Judges (Service Condition) Rules. The copy of the above\n\nreferred documents are at Annexure P-14 (Colly).\n\n10. The petitioner with a reference to DOPT letter dated 23.08.2017,\n\nwhereby for addition of ten years service, only particulars of Members\n\nappointed from Bar post 19.02.2007 were called from CAT, made a\n\nrepresentation to DOPT on 14.09.2017 taking number of legal grounds and\n\nreferring to the discrimination meted out to the petitioner vide Annexure\n\nP-15. However, by an impugned order dated 13.09.2017 issued in reference\n\nto Sh. N. Dharmadan pursuant upon the judgment of Hon'ble High Court of\n\nKerala to State that only Members who have been appointed from Bar on or\n\nafter 19.02.2007 are being considered for addition of ten years practice for\n\npension, pursuant upon judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\n11. The petitioner submitted that it was on an irrational and arbitrary\n\nground that the petitioner and other identical situated were appointed as\n\nJudicial (Member) under the Conditions of Service of 1985 and those\n\nMembers appointed post 19.02.2007 had service conditions at par with High\n\nCourt Judge. In this decision, the DOPT has violated\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 9 of 30\n\nConstitution of India and in oblivion of the fact that the petitioner's Pension\n\nwas also determined under High Court Rules and that addition of ten years\n\npractice has nothing to do that High Court Judge or Conditions of Service.\n\nThe discriminatory attitude and misinterpretation of judgment of Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court resulted in denial of Fundamental Right of the petitioner.\n\nCopy of the impugned order is at Annexure P-2.\n\n12. The petitioner further submitted that by another impugned\n\ncommunication/order addressed to Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)\n\nby DOPT dated 15.11.2017, the earlier stand taken in order dated 13.9.2017\n\nhas been reiterated and only 17 members (Judicial) appointed from bar, post\n\n19.2.2007 have been made entitled to the benefit vide Annexure P-1.\n\n13. The petitioner pursuant upon decision of the DOPT dated 15.11.2017\n\nmade a representation for reconsideration of the issue vide representation\n\ndated 8.1.2018 which is at Annexure P-16. The said representation was\n\nfavorably recommended by the CAT to the DOPT to take a decision vide\n\ncommunication dated 17.1.2018 vide Annexure P-17.\n\n14. It is further submitted by the petitioner that in the relevant truncated\n\nHigh Court Judges, Conditions of Service Act, 1954\n, whereby in First\n\nSchedule Part III, the formula for determination of Pension meant for High\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 10 of 30\n\nCourt Judges is mutatis mutandis adopted by DOPT for fixing and revising\n\nthe pension of the petitioner which is at Annexure P-18.\n\n15. Pursuant upon the judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in\n\nRamakrishnam Raju vs. Union of India\n: 2014 (2) KLT 218 (Supra), an\n\namendment has been carried out in the\nHigh Court Judges Act\n, whereby in\n\nSchedule I part III, the minimum pension has undergone and upward\n\nrevision to ₹45,016/- per completed year of service. The petitioner made a\n\nrepresentation to the CAT for revising the pension of the petitioner in\n\naccordance with the amendment, which is pending implementation. The\n\ncopy and Notification and request of the petitioner is at Annexure P-19\n\n(Colly).\n\n16. The petitioner further submitted that right to pension is a fundamental\n\nright of the petitioner under the Constitution of India. Above all, entitlement\n\nfor correct and appropriate pension without any discrimination is also an\n\nimportant legal right of the petitioner. The respondents have misinterpreted\n\nand misunderstood the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nP\n\nRamakrishnam Raju\n(Supra). The respondents have taken the ratio of this\n\njudgment as to applicability only to High Court Judges. In this\n\nmisconceived stand, the respondents have taken stand that Judicial Members\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 11 of 30\n\nappointed from Bar, post 19.2.2007 are entitled for addition of ten years\n\npractice towards qualifying service. It is pertinent to note that after\n\n19.2.2007, the service conditions of a member was brought at par with a\n\nHigh Court Judge. However the amendment has not bestowed a status of\n\nHigh Court Judge to the Judicial Members appointed on or after 19.2.2007.\n\n17. In this view of the matter, if the interpretation and understanding of\n\nDOPT is accepted, then even the Judicial Members appointed after\n\n19.2.2007 are not entitled to count ten years practice as they are not High\n\nCourt Judges. What went in oblivion of DOPT is a fact that the question of\n\nlaw decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court was not directed towards only\n\nHigh Court Judges, but has uniform and universal application to an advocate\n\nappointed on a judicial post directly with more than ten years practice at\n\nBar. Accordingly, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has referred to the decision\n\npertaining to higher judiciary in the judgment of P Ramakrishnam Raju.\n\nWhat is required for addition of ten years practice to a Member (Judicial)\n\nappointed on direct recruitment basis towards qualifying service is that he\n\nshould have been appointed on a judicial post. In fact, there is virtually no\n\ndifference between a member (Judicial) appointed from Bar pre or post\n\n19.2.2007. Both categories hold a judicial post of court of first instance\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 12 of 30\n\nunder the constitution of India. The eligibility conditions for appointment\n\nare identical. The pension of pre 19.2.2007 appointee Member (Judicial)\n\nfrom bar is fixed under\nHigh Court Act\nand Rules.\n\n18. It is further submitted that the judgment in P Ramakrkrishnam Raju\n\nhas laid down the ratio decidendi to the above effect. However, the\n\nrespondents in understanding the judgment arbitrarily discriminated the\n\npetitioner on the facts of the case by misconstruing it in oblivion of\n\njudgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nL Chandrakumar and All India\n\nYoung Lawyers Association\n(Supra). This has prejudiced the petitioner and\n\ndeprived him of Rightful Pension as compared to post 19.2.2007 appointees.\n\nThus, the present petition deserves to be allowed.\n\n19. On the other hand, Mr. Abhay Prakash, learned standing counsel for\n\nthe Central Government submitted that the conditions of service of\n\nChairmen and members of CAT were made equivalent to those applicable to\n\nJudges of the High Court pursuant to the amendment Act, 2006. Provisions\n\nof said amendment Act of 2006 came into force with effect from 19.2.2007.\n\nBefore this amendment of 2006, the conditions of service of the Chairmen\n\nand members were regulated by the CAT (Service and allowances and\n\nconditions of service and chairman, vice chairman and members), Rules,\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 13 of 30\n\n1985. The conditions of service of Chairman and Members of the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal (CAT) have been amended and made equivalent to\n\nthose applicable to Central Group A officers, under\nFinance Act, 2017\nand\n\nunder the new rules notified on 1.6.2017 are under judicial review before the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\n20. Pursuant to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in WP (C)\n\nNo. 521/2002 for reckoning 10 years' practice as an advocate for qualifying\n\nservice for pensions of Judges of High Courts elevated from the Bar, the\n\nrespondents have received representations from Judicial Members of CAT\n\n(appointed from Bar), with a request to grant similar benefits as they have\n\nalso been practicing as an Advocate before the appointment to the post of\n\nJudicial Members in CAT and their service conditions were the same as\n\napplicable to Judges of the High Court.\n\n21. Learned counsel further submitted that the matter was considered by\n\nthe respondents in consultation with the Department of Legal Affairs and\n\nDepartment of Expenditure. As per rules dated 1.6.2017, service conditions\n\nof the Chairman and Members of CAT were amended and the conditions as\n\napplicable to Central Group A officers were made applicable to the\n\nChairman and Members of CAT.\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 14 of 30\n\n22. Therefore, in the light of the Supreme Court's order in P\n\nRamakrishna Raju vs. UOI & Ors. (Supra), it was decided that only those\n\nJudicial Members of CAT, who were appointed from Bar between 19.2.2007\n\nto 31.5.2017, are to be considered eligible for grant of pensionary benefits.\n\n23. Accordingly, the Judicial Members including the applicant, (petitioner\n\nherein), who was appointed before 19.2.2007 and therefore, are covered by\n\nthe Central Administrative Tribunal (Salaries and Allowances and\n\nConditions of Service of Chairman, Vice-Chairman and Members) Rules,\n\n1985 were intimated of the respondent's decision. The true copy of the\n\nintimation to the Judicial Members is annexed as Annexure A-1.\n\n24. Accordingly, the present petition deserves to be dismissed.\n\n25. I have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n26. The pension payable to the Members of CAT is linked with the\n\nPension of High Court Judges under Part III of 1 st\nSchedule of High Court\n\nJudges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Act, 1954\n. Since the status of\n\nthe Member (Judicial) appointed before 19.02.2007 is equal to the\n\nAdditional Secretary to the Government of India, the Pension is to be fixed\n\nproportionally to the Pension per annum payable to the Judge of High Court\n\nunder Part III of Schedule 1. This fact has been admitted by the DOPT while\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 15 of 30\n\nanswering information sought by Ex-Member (Judicial) Sh. J.K.Kaushik\n\nunder\nRTI Act, 2005\non 8.4.2010.\n\n27. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while dealing with the case of a direct\n\nrecruit to Delhi Higher Judicial Service in\nAll India Young Lawyers\n\nAssociation\nCase referred to in\nRamakrishnam Raju\n's case, held that 10\n\nyears practice at the Bar should be added for computing Pension. The said\n\ncase did not pertain to a High Court Judge, but concerned higher judicial\n\nservices at District Judge level.\n\nThe Supreme Court in a subsequent\n\njudgement of\nP. Ramakrishnam Raju\n(Supra) upheld and reiterated the\n\njudgement in All India Young Lawyers Association and directed addition of\n\n10 years service in view of Part I and III of the Judges conditions of service\n\nby holding as under:\n\n\"25) The fixation of higher pension to the Judges drawn from the\nSubordinate Judiciary who have served for shorter period in\ncontradistinction to Judges drawn from the Bar who have served\nfor longer period with less pension is highly discriminatory and\nbreach of\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution. The classification itself is\nunreasonable without any legally acceptable nexus with the object\nsought to be achieved.\n\n26) The meager pension for Judges drawn from the Bar and\nserved for less than 12 years on the Bench adversely affects the\nimage of the Judiciary. When pensions are meager because of the\nshorter service, lawyers who attain distinction in the profession\nmay not, because of this anomaly, accept the office of Judgeship.\n\nWhen capable lawyers do not show inclination towards Judgeship,\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 16 of 30\n\nthe quality of justice declines.\n\n27) In most of the States, the Judgeship of the High Court is\noffered to advocates who are in the age group of 50-55 years,\nsince pre-eminence at the Bar is achieved normally at that age.\nAfter remaining at the top for a few years, a successful lawyer\nmay show inclination to accept Judgeship, since that is the\nculmination of the desire and objective of most of the lawyers.\nWhen persons holding constitutional office retire from service,\nmaking discrimination in the fixation of their pensions depending\nupon the source from which they were appointed is in breach of\n\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1)\nof the Constitution. One rank one pension\nmust be the norm in respect of a Constitutional Office.\n\n28) When a Civil Servant retires from service, the family pension\nis fixed at a higher rate whereas in the case of Judges of the High\nCourt, it is fixed at a lower rate. No discrimination can be made in\nthe matter of payment of family pension. The expenditure for\npension to the High Court Judges is charged on the Consolidated\nFund of India under\nArticle 112(3)(d)(iii)\nof the Constitution.\"\n\n28. The Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in L.\n\nChandrakumar Vs. UOI & Ors.: 1997 (3) SCC 261 regarding status of the\n\nCentral Administrative Tribunal observed as under:\n\n\"99. In view of the reasoning adopted by us, we hold\nthat Clause 2(d) of\nArticle 323A\nand Clause 3(d) of\n\nArticle 323B\n, to the extent they exclude the jurisdiction of\nthe High Courts and the Supreme Court under Articles\n226/227 and 32 of the Constitution, are unconstitutional.\n\nSection 28\nof the Act and the \"exclusion of jurisdiction\"\n\nclauses in all other legislations enacted under the aegis\nof\nArticles 323A\nand\n323B\nwould, to the same extent, be\nunconstitutional. The jurisdiction conferred upon the\nHigh Courts under Articles 226/227 and upon the\nSupreme Court under\nArticle 32\nof the Constitution is\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 17 of 30\n\npart of the inviolable basic structure of our Constitution.\nWhile this jurisdiction cannot be ousted, other courts and\nTribunals may perform a supplemental role in\ndischarging the powers conferred by Articles 226/227\nand 32 of the Constitution. The Tribunals created under\n\nArticle 323A\nand\nArticle 323B\nof the Constitution are\npossessed of the competence to test the constitutional\nvalidity of statutory provisions and rules. All decisions of\nthese Tribunals will, however, be subject to scrutiny\nbefore a Division Bench of the High Court within whose\njurisdiction the concerned Tribunal falls. The Tribunals\nwill, nevertheless, continue to act like Courts of first\ninstance in respect of the areas of law for which they\nhave been constituted. It will not, therefore, be open for\nlitigants to directly approach the High Courts even in\ncases where they question the vires of statutory\nlegislations (except where the legislation which creates\nthe particular Tribunal is challenged) by overlooking the\njurisdiction of the concerned Tribunal.\nSection 5(6)\nof the\nAct is valid and constitutional and is to be interpreted in\nthe manner we have indicated.\"\n\n29. The above observations clearly establishes that, the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal has been a creation under\nArticles 323-A\nand\n323-B\n\nof the Constitution of India. The Tribunal has been treated as a Court of First\n\nInstance in respect of Service Law. Moreover, the Tribunal has not been\n\nconsidered as a subordinate Court under the Jurisdiction of High Court as\n\nprovided under\nArticle 227\nof the Constitution of India. The High Court has\n\nno power of superintendence over the Tribunal, but the jurisdiction of\n\nscrutiny has been allowed. Thus, the Tribunal has been treated mutatis\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 18 of 30\n\nmutandis a District Court for the purposes of dispensation of justice as Court\n\nof First Instance though, the Tribunal has been treated at par with the High\n\nCourt.\n\n30. Accordingly, as per\nSection 6\nof A.T.Act, 1985 as amended till\n\ndate, the qualification for appointment of a Judicial Member is sina qua non\n\nof qualification of a Judge of a High Court laid down under\nArticle 217\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India. All Members (Judicial) appointed from the Bar are\n\neligible to be appointed as High Court Judges. Irrespective of the\n\namendment of A.T.Act 1985 in 2006 w.e.f. 19.02.2007, the qualification for\n\na Judge of the High Court has not been altered.\nIn such view of the matter,\n\nthe observation of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramakrishnam Raju's\n\ncase (supra) with a reference to the judgement in\nAll India Young Lawyers\n\nAssociation\n's case makes alternatively, a Judicial member appointed prior to\n\n19.02.2007 at par with a District Judge as the CAT being treated as Court of\n\nFirst Instance. Addition of ten years of practice to such Member as an\n\nAdvocate, towards qualifying service, is also admissible to these Members.\n\nThe stand of the DOPT contained in their communication dated 23.08.2017\n\nto restrict the addition of ten years practice to only those Members (Judicial)\n\nappointed from Bar w.e.f. 19.902.2007 is without any logic, rationale and is\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 19 of 30\n\nrather goes against the dicta in\nRamakrishnam Raju\n's case. The stand\n\nbrings inequality among equals and amounts to hostile discrimination\n\nviolative of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the Constitution of India. The purported\n\nstand of DOPT appears to be cantered around amendment of A.T.Act, 1985\n\nw.e.f. 19.02.2007 by which, the conditions of service of Member (Judicial)\n\nhas been treated at par with a High Court Judge. However, the fact remains\n\nthat Judicial Members appointed from the Bar are not High Court Judges\n\nbut, by virtue of similarity in Service Conditions, are treated at par with the\n\nHigh Court Judges. This analogy is palpably arbitrary and promotes\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of cut-off date of 19.2.2007 without any\n\nreasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In fact, the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court both in the case of subordinate Judiciary and High Court\n\nJudges, directed addition of ten years practice of an officer appointed from\n\nthe Bar towards qualifying service computation of Pension on the ground\n\nthat, the maximum age for an entry in service is 45 years and since the\n\nretirement age is 60 years, the incumbent would not be able to get Pension.\n\nThe service of a Judicial Member appointed from Bar could not exceed 10\n\nyears both under Old and New A.T. Act.\n\nIn such an event, the benefit of\n\nmaximum pension is denied and accordingly, the addition of 10 years\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 20 of 30\n\npractice to a direct recruit Advocate as Judicial Member in the Tribunal\n\ntowards qualifying service of pension is implied and is a discerned principle\n\non the basis of Ratio decidendi of Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nP.\n\nRamakrishnam Raju\n's case.\n\n31. Accordingly, the DOPT has to follow the dicta of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court. The judgement in\nRamakrishnam Raju\n's case cannot be\n\ninterpreted otherwise. The Ratio decidendi is to give added year of\n\nqualifying service of 10 years to an Advocate, as his practice on his being\n\nappointed to a subordinate higher judiciary or High Court. Since the\n\nMembers (Judicial) appointed prior to 19.02.2007 fulfil the above criteria\n\nand in all respects including eligibility, discharge of functions and duties are\n\nat par with the Judicial Members appointed post 19.2.2007, no hostility or\n\ninvidious discrimination could be meted out to them. In such view of the\n\nmatter, the communication of DOPT dated 23.08.2017 does not stand\n\nscrutiny of law and is rather in violation of\nArticles 14\nand\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n32. The RTI received by the petitioner also disclosed a communication\n\ndated 11.1.2016 sent by the Principal Bench of the Tribunal to the DOPT\n\nregarding pensionary benefits to the Judicial members of CAT coming from\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 21 of 30\n\nBar, in the backdrop of judgment in P.Ramakrishnam Raju. In this\n\ninformation, the CAT has referred to an amendment under Rule 8 of the\n\nCAT (Salaries & Allowances) Rules, amended on 22.7.2009. In this\n\namendment, there has been a substitution in Sub-Rule 2 of Rule A whereby,\n\nthe minimum pension has been increased from ₹7,074/- per annum to\n\n₹14,532/- per annum w.e.f. 1.1.2006.\n\n33. It is pertinent to mention here that, the pension is at par with pension\n\nof High Court judges' payable under Part III of 1st Schedule under High\n\nCourt Judges Service Conditions Act of 1954. This shows that, the Judicial\n\nMembers from Bar appointed prior to 19.2.2007 are also entitled to the same\n\npension.\n\n34. It is further pertinent to mention here that an order dated 15.11.2017\n\naddressed to the Joint Registrar, CAT by the DOPT, a reference has been\n\nmade to\nSection 8(3)\nof A.T. Amendment Act 2006 to contend that\n\nconditions of service of Members appointed post 19.2.2007 shall be at par\n\nwith High Court Judges. It was further stated that 17 Members appointed\n\npost 19.2.2007 being eligible are being considered for benefit of addition of\n\n10 years practice as qualifying service, as per the judgement of Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court\nreferred above\n. In this communication, CAT, Principal\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 22 of 30\n\nBench has been requested to redress the representation received on the\n\nsubject which also includes the representation of the petitioner.\nThe stand\n\ntaken by the DOPT in its communication dated 15.11.2017 as to non-\n\napplicability of judgement in\nP. Ramakrishnam Raju\n(supra) is both\n\nfactually and legally incorrect. The DOPT consistently in response to an\n\ninformation sought by former Member (Judicial) Sh. J.K. Kaushik, vide its\n\ncommunications dated 28.1.2010, 4.3.2010 and 8.4.2010 have accepted that\n\nthe pension payable to the Members of CAT appointed before 19.2.2007 has\n\nbeen in proportion to the pension per annum payable to a Judge of High\n\nCourt and also that the pension payable to the Members of CAT is being\n\nlinked with the pension of High Court Judges payable under the provisions\n\nof\nPar III of First Schedule of the High Court Judges (Salaries & Conditions\n\nof Service) Act, 1954\n. It was also admitted that as per the above provisions\n\nof the\nHigh Court Act\n, the pension of Members of CAT appointed before\n\n19.2.2007 has been revised from ₹7,074/- to ₹14,032/- w.e.f. 1.1.2006.\n\n35. Pursuant upon judgment of Ramakrishnam Raju, representation has\n\nbeen made by the petitioner to the Tribunal as well as DOPT for addition of\n\n10 years practice as qualifying service and grant of revised pension and\n\narrears of retiral benefits w.e.f. 1.1.2011. The CAT has taken up the cases of\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 23 of 30\n\nMembers, including the petitioner with the DOPT for addition of 10 years\n\npractice for pension vide communication dated 10.07.2017. A letter from\n\nDOPT dated 23.8.2017 called for only particulars of Members appointed\n\nfrom 19.2.2007 to 31.5.2017 for extending the benefit of judgment of\n\nSupreme Court. The Principal Bench of CAT in its communication dated\n\n25.8.2017 addressed to DOPT also recommended for incorporation of the\n\nname of the petitioner and other similarly situated, for extending the benefit\n\nof Hon'ble Supreme Court judgments by addition of 10 years practice\n\ntowards qualifying service.\nIn this communication, the Ld. Tribunal had\n\nwritten that the petitioner and others are also entitled to the benefit of\n\njudgment of\nP. Ramakrishnam Raju\n(supra), as they are entitled to draw\n\npension as per\nHigh Court Judges Act\n. However, the DOPT did not consider\n\nits earlier stand treating the Judicial Member appointed from Bar at par with\n\nMembers appointed post 19.2.2007 for the purpose of calculation and\n\ndrawal of Pension, in accordance with High Court Judges conditions of\n\nservice. In this furtherance, the latest communication of DOPT dated\n\n15.11.2017 addressed to the petitioner and also Principal Bench is silent and\n\nthere has been no consideration thereof, of the aforesaid fact.\n\n36. It is pertinent to mention here that Unamended A.T.Act prior to 2006\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 24 of 30\n\nand also post 2006 does not discriminate between the members Judicial\n\nappointed from the Bar, as the eligibility qualifications are identical i.e. 10\n\nyears practice as an Advocate. Moreover, in the judgment of P.\n\nRamakrishnam Raju (surpa), the issue as\nlaid down by\nway of ratio\n\ndecidendi is that the service of a Judicial Officer is to be counted for fixation\n\nof pension and there was no valid reason as to why the experience at Bar\n\ncannot be treated as equivalent for that purpose. In this furtherance, the\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court not only allowed addition of 10 years practice for\n\nan Advocate appointed from the Bar on a judicial post as qualifying service\n\nfor determination of pension, but also applied uniformly to an Additional\n\nDistrict Judge, High Court Judge as well as Supreme Court Judge. The\n\npetitioner being an appointee, even before 19.2.2007 was an Advocate with\n\n10 years practice at Bar and was appointed on a judicial post under\nArticle\n\n323A\nof the Constitution of India. Thus, the stand taken by the DOPT in its\n\ncommunication dated 15.11.2007 is without consideration of the above facts\n\nand documentary proof and admissions. Mere reliance on Clause 8(3) of\n\nA.T. Amended Act, 2006\nin inconsequential.\n\n37. The stand of the respondent DOPT is that only those advocates who\n\nhave been appointed under the\nAT Act\nof 2006 post 19.2.2007 are only\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 25 of 30\n\nentitled to addition of 10 years Bar practice for pension, is a misconceived\n\nmisinterpretation of the judgment of Supreme Court in\nP. Ramakrishnam\n\nRaju\n(supra).\n\nIn\nthe said judgment\nanother judgement of the Supreme Court\n\npertaining to District Judges appointed from Bar in Delhi was also involved,\n\ntitled\nGovt. of NCT of Delhi Vs. All India Young Lawyer Association\n,\n\nwhereby a claim for addition of 15 years service was sought for pension by\n\nthe District Judges. The Supreme Court in P. Ramakrishnam Raju taking\n\nthe logic that the lawyers directly appointed to judicial post from Bar have\n\nfew years in judiciary as such the calculated pension is too meagre,\n\naccordingly maximum of 10 years the practice at Bar has been added to as\n\nqualifying service for pension to the District Judges appointed from Bar. In\n\ncompliance of the judgement, the Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules 1970\n\nunder Rule 26B proviso by an amendment dated 6.11.2009 effective from\n\n24.2.2006, allowed addition of 10 years practice at Bar as qualifying service\n\nfor pension.\n\n38. It is also observed by the Supreme Court in\nP. Ramakrishnam Raju\n\n(supra) that in the three-tier judicial system provided by the Constitution,\n\nmembers of the Bar, who join the Higher Judicial Service at the District\n\nJudges level, on retirement, get the befit of 10 years addition to their service\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 26 of 30\n\nof the purposes of pension (Rule 26B of the DHJS Rules). Judges of the\n\nSupreme Court, who are appointed from the Bar given a period of 10 years\n\nto their service for the purposes of pension (\nSection 13A\nof the Amendment\n\nAct, 2005). However, the benefit of 10 years addition to their service for the\n\npurposes of pension is being denied to the Judges of the High Court\n\nappointed from the Bar, which is arbitrary and violative of\nArticle 14\nof the\n\nConstitution of India.\n\n39. The Explanation (aa) appended to\nArticle 217 (2)\nof the Constitution\n\nof India envisages that, \"in computing the period during which a person has\n\nbeen an advocate of a High Court, there shall be included any period during\n\nwhich the person has held judicial office or the office of a member of a\n\ntribunal or any post, under the Union or State, requiring special knowledge\n\nof law after he became an advocate.\" Thus, treats the experience of an\n\nAdvocate at the Bar the period of judicial office held by him at par.\n\n40. The above ratio of the Supreme Court is clear that the Principle\n\nenunciated to count 10 years Bar practice of an advocate has not been\n\nrestricted to only High Court Judges but is applicable qua an advocate\n\nhaving 10 years practice appointed on direct recruitment basis to a Judicial\n\nPost. Once it includes the post of ADJ, it cannot exclude the Judicial\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 27 of 30\n\nMembers appointed from the Bar in the tribunal even before 19.2.2007. This\n\ncut off date has no reasonable nexus with the object of redeeming an\n\nadvocate a right of respectable pension in case of less service by addition of\n\n10 years practice at bar as a qualifying service.\n\n41. A similar issue came before High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in\n\nWP(C) No. 32047 of 2017 in case of\nN. Dharmadan v. Union of India and\n\nOrs.\ndecided on 5.4.2018 whereby the above mentioned High Court has held\n\nas under:\n\n\"9. The question to be considered is whether there can be\na classification between the members for the purpose of\npension reckoning the bar service. It is settled law in the\nlight of\nD.S.Nakara v. Union of India\n[AIR 1982 SC 130]\nthat there cannot be any invidious classification, on the\nbasis of a cut off date. Though the Rules were applicable\nat the time of the appointment of the petitioner and till his\ndemitting of office, the qualification prescribed for\nappointment of judicial member continues to be the same\never since the administrative Tribunals were established\nunder the 1985 Act.\nSection 10 A cannot stand in the way\nof extending the benefit of the judgment in Ramakrishna\nRaju's case. The insertion of Section 10A can only be to\nprotect the service conditions of those who were\nappointed before the insertion. It cannot be interpreted to\ndeny a benefit which is available to the Members who got\nappointment from the bar as in the case of High Court\nJudges. Even though the salary was prescribed as per\ndifferent rules the petitioner continues to get the pension\nand pensionary benefits as applicable to High Court\nJudges. In the case of applicability of the judgment in\nRamakrishna Raju's case when all the High Court Judges\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 28 of 30\n\nare eligible to get their pension fixed from 1.4.2004, it\ncannot be said that that benefit cannot be extended in the\ncase of the petitioner just because he happened to be\nappointed before 19.2.2007. The cut off date fixed for the\npurpose of the extension of the benefit of the judgment is\ntherefore unreasonable and arbitrary.\"\n\n42. Accordingly, in view of the above discussion and the settled legal\n\nposition impugned orders dated 15.11.2017 (Annexure P-1) dated\n\n13.09.2018 (Annexure P-2) are hereby set aside. Consequently, it is declared\n\nthat the petitioner is entitled to get 10 years of his Bar practice along with\n\nhis service as Judicial Member for the purpose of pension, as in the case of\n\nthose Judicial Members appointed after 19.2.2007 and in case of High Court\n\nJudges. Consequently, the respondents are directed to add 10 years practice\n\nof the petitioner as an Advocate at Bar towards qualifying service and\n\nconsequently revise the pension and gratuity of the petitioner and arrears to\n\nbe calculated and disbursed to the petitioner by issuing of a revised PPO\n\nincluding incorporation of pension. The respondent shall take steps to revise\n\nthe pension due to the petitioner within two months.\n\n43. The writ petition is, accordingly, allowed.\n\nCM APPL. Nos. 13994/2018 & 24073/2018\n\n44. In view of the order passed in the present writ petition, these\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 29 of 30\n\napplications have been rendered infructuous and are accordingly, disposed\n\nof such.\n\n(SURESH KUMAR KAIT)\nJUDGE\nJANUARY 23, 2019\nrd/p/gb\n\nW.P.(C) 3223/2018 Page 30 of 30",
