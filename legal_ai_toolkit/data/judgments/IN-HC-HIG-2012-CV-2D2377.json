(Oral)\n\nBy this order I proposed to dispose of CWP Nos.17808, 13778,\n\n13835, 14016, 14053, 15291, 15657, 15680, 15768, 16881, 16900, 17815,\n\n18739, 18752, 18761, 13774, 18440, 17121 and 16934 of 2011 as common\n\nquestions of facts and law are involved therein.\n\nFacts are being taken from CWP No.17808 of 2011 wherein\n\npleadings are complete and the stand of the respondents denying the benefit\n\nclaimed by the petitioners stands projected. Petitioners undisputedly are\n\nC.W.P.No.17808 of 2011 -5-\n\nworking on technical posts and since they were working on such posts, they\n\nwere granted the pay-scale for which they were entitled to on the basis of\n\nvarious judgments passed by this Court. The lead case being CWP\n\nNo.18754 of 1991 titled as\nGurdev Singh and others vs. State of Haryana\n\nand others\n, decided on 18.01.2010. While implementing the judgment\n\npassed by this Court in various writ petitions including the above-mentioned\n\nwrit, State of Haryana issued letter dated 9.8.2010. This letter although\n\ngranted the claim which was made by the employees who were working on\n\ntechnical posts i.e. the pay-scale of Rs.1200-2040 w.e.f. 1.5.1990 or from\n\nthe date subsequent thereto when they joined the service. But the arrears\n\nof the said fixation of pay and subsequent revision thereof have been\n\ndenied to them on the ground that while disposing of CWP No.10074 of\n\n2010 and 10276 of 2010, this Court had not said a word about arrears and\n\nthe entitlement of the petitioners therein. Basing on the said letter and\n\njudgments, petitioners have been granted the fixation of notional pay-scales\n\nas per their entitlement but the arrears have been denied to them. It is, at\n\nthis stage, that the petitioners have approached this Court by way of the\n\npresent writ petitions.\n\nCounsel for the petitioners contends that the denial of arrears to\n\nthe petitioners is primarily based upon the order passed by this Court in\n\nCWP No.10276 of 2010 titled as\nNihal Singh and others vs. State of\n\nHaryana and others\ndecided on 27.5.2010. After passing of the said order\n\nand issuance of letter dated 9.8.2010, petitioners in that writ petition and\n\nconnected writ petitions, where arrears were not granted to them, had\n\nspecifically moved applications before this Court for modification of order\n\ndated 27.5.2010. Notice of the applications wherein the petitioners have\n\nC.W.P.No.17808 of 2011 -6-\n\nclaimed arrears from the date of their entitlement of the pay-scale was\n\nissued to the respondents and upon hearing the counsel for the parties, this\n\nCourt was pleased to restrict the claim of monetary benefits of the pay-\n\nscales to 38 months preceding the date of filing of the writ petitions vide\n\norder dated 12.1.2011 (Annexure P-7). On this basis, counsel contends\n\nthat the petitioners are entitled to arrears of pay after the fixation of pay as\n\nper the entitlement in same terms from the date of grant of pay fixation.\n\nCounsel for the respondents, on the basis of the reply filed by\n\nthe respondents, submit that the petitioners are not entitled to the arrears of\n\nrevision of pay-scales as claimed by them as they have been granted the\n\nbenefit as per letter dated 9.8.2010 (Annexure P-6) which does not confer\n\nany right of arrears on the employees. He further contends that the\n\npetitioners are also not entitled to the arrears for the reason that they have\n\napproached this Court after an inordinate delay.\n\nI have heard counsel for the parties and gone through the\n\nrecords of the case.\n\nFacts are not in dispute that the petitioners were granted the\n\nbenefit of the pay-scales of technical posts and thereafter the revision of the\n\npay-scale on notional basis in the light of the judgment passed by this Court\n\nin\nGurdev Singh\n's case (supra).\n\nAlthough in\nthe said judgment\n, benefit of\n\narrears of pay was granted from the date of their entitlement but this was\n\ndone primarily because the petitioners in those writ petitions have\n\napproached the Court in the year 1991 itself and their claim was\n\nw.e.f.1.5.1990 but subsequently the petitioners have approached this Court\n\nby filing various writ petitions especially in the year 2010 after the decision\n\nin\nGurdev Singh\n's case (supra). This Court initially while disposing of\n\nC.W.P.No.17808 of 2011 -7-\n\nCWP No.10074 of 2010 and 10276 of 2010 did not grant any arrears of pay\n\nfixation and revision but had only granted notional fixation thereof which\n\nwas made the basis by the respondents for not granting the benefit of\n\narrears of pay to the petitioners.\n\nHowever, they did not take into\n\nconsideration the subsequent order dated 12.1.2011 passed by this Court in\n\napplications moved by the petitioners in CWP Nos.10074 of 2010 and\n\n10276 of 2010 claiming the grant of arrears in the light of the judgment\n\npassed in\nGurdev Singh\n's case (supra). Although the claim as made by\n\nthe petitioners in those applications was not granted in toto but arrears were\n\nrestricted to 38 months preceding from the date of filing the writ petitions.\n\nThe respondents, while granting the benefit of the pay-scale to the\n\npetitioners on the technical posts held by them and fixing their notional pay\n\ntaking into consideration the revision of the pay-scales subsequently,\n\nshould have also taken into consideration the subsequent order dated\n\n12.1.2011 passed by this Court in CM No.10597 of 2010 in CWP No.10276\n\nof 2010 and other connected matters (Annexure P-7).\n\nIn view of the subsequent clarification by this Court, denial of\n\narrears of pay fixation along with subsequent revision thereof prior to 38\n\nmonths from the date of filing of writ petitions, cannot be said to be\n\njustified and, therefore, they are entitled to the benefit of arrears of 38\n\nmonths from the date of grant of pay-scales to them. As the claim of\n\nfixation of pay and revision and subsequent revision thereof have been\n\ngranted to the petitioners based on the judgment of this Court which has\n\nbeen subsequently clarified by this Court by modifying the initial order and\n\ngranted them the arrears, consequential benefits should also flow to the\n\npetitioners as they have been granted the said benefit. Accordingly, the\n\nC.W.P.No.17808 of 2011 -8-\n\nstand taken by the respondents denying the benefit of arrears to the\n\npetitioners cannot sustain and is hereby rejected.\n\nCounsel for the respondents have taken a plea that the\n\npetitioners have approached this Court after a long delay and, therefore, are\n\nnot entitled to the arrears as claimed by them also cannot be accepted as\n\nthey have already been denied the benefit of arrears of pay from the date of\n\ntheir actual date of entitlement because of their delayed claim made by\n\nthem and claim of their entitlement. Accordingly, this objection also, as\n\nraised by the counsel for the respondents, is not accepted and stands\n\nrejected.\n\nIn the light of the above, present writ petitions are allowed with\n\ndirections to the respondents to grant the petitioners arrears of pay for 38\n\nmonths preceding the date of the order by which they were granted the\n\nbenefit of fixation of pay and subsequent revision thereof.\n\nAs far as petitioner No.3-Roshan Lal son of Attar Singh in\n\nCWP No.17808 of 2011 is concerned, it has been stated in the reply that the\n\npetitioner does not belong to the division of answering respondent No.3\n\nand, therefore, his service particulars are not known to the answering\n\nrespondent.\nIn this regard, it is clarified that in case the petitioner has\n\nalready been granted the benefit of fixation of pay on notional basis as per\n\nthe order passed by the Court in\nGurdev Singh\n's case (supra), he shall also\n\nbe entitled to the same benefit as other petitioners as mentioned above.\n\nPhotocopy of this order be placed on record on all the\n\nconnected cases.\n\nFebruary 13, 2012 ( AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH )\n\nC.W.P.No.17808 of 2011 -9-\n\npoonam JUDGE",
