OF 2022\n (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 17397-17398 of 2021)\n\n M/S RAVI RANJAN DEVELOPERS PVT. LTD. … Appellant(s)\n\n VERSUS\n\n ADITYA KUMAR CHATTERJEE … Respondent(s)\n\n JUDGMENT\n\n INDIRA BANERJEE, J.\n\n Leave granted.\n\n 2. These appeals are against an order dated 13 th August 2021 passed by the\n\n Calcutta High Court, allowing the Arbitration Petition No.46/2021 filed by the\n\n Respondent under \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n\n (hereinafter referred to as the 'A&C Act'), for appointment of an Arbitrator and\n\n also an order dated 4th October 2021 passed by the High Court, rejecting an\n\n application made by the Appellant for review of the said order dated 13 th\n\n August 2021, being R.V.W.O. No.14/2021.\n\n 3.\n\nSignature Not Verified\n\n The Appellant and the Respondent entered into a Development\n\nDigitally signed by\n\n Agreement dated 15th June 2015 for development of property situated at\nRachna\nDate: 2022.03.28\n20:35:42 IST\nReason:\n\n Muzaffarpur in Bihar measuring about 12 Kaithas and 11 Dhurs, more fully\n\n described in the said Development Agreement, outside the jurisdiction of\n\n\f 2\n\nCalcutta High Court. The said Development Agreement executed and registered\n\nin Muzaffarpur in Bihar, contains an arbitration clause, which is set out\n\nhereinbelow for convenience:\n\n “37. That in case of any dispute or difference between the parties\n arising out of and relating to this development agreement, the same\n shall be settled by reference of the disputes or differences to the\n Arbitrators appointed by both the parties and such Arbitration shall be\n conducted under the provisions of the \nIndian Arbitration and\n Conciliation Act, 1996\n as amended from time to time and the sitting\n of the said Arbitral Tribunal shall be at Kolkata.”\n\n4. Differences and disputes arose in relation to the said Development\n\nAgreement, giving rise to various proceedings between the parties. On 24 th April\n\n2019, the Respondent terminated the said Development Agreement. The\n\nAppellant has not accepted the termination of the said Development\n\nAgreement.\n\n5. On 15th May 2019, the Appellant filed a petition before the Real Estate\n\nRegulatory Authority, (referred to in short as ‘RERA’) at Patna, which was\n\nregistered as RERA Case No.56/377/2019. Soon thereafter, on 17th August 2019,\n\nthe Respondent filed a petition under \nSection 9\n of the A&C Act in the Court of\n\nthe District Judge, Muzaffarpur seeking interim protection in respect of the\n\nproperty in question.\n\n6. On 1st October 2019, the Respondent filed a complaint before the\n\nMuzaffarpur Municipal Corporation alleging that the building being constructed\n\nby the Appellant was in violation of the sanctioned building plan and seeking\n\nstoppage of construction. The Muzaffarpur Municipal Corporation dismissed the\n\ncomplaint on 22nd January 2020.\n\n\f 3\n\n7. The Respondent appealed to the Bihar Building Municipal Tribunal. The\n\nappeal is stated to be pending. Soon thereafter, the Respondent sent notice to\n\nthe Appellant invoking the arbitration clause under the Development\n\nAgreement. The notice was sent to the registered office of the Appellant at\n\nPatna in Bihar, outside the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. In November,\n\n2020, the Respondent moved an arbitration petition being A.P. No.2020 in the\n\nCalcutta High Court under \nSection 11\n sub-section (6) of the A&C Act for\n\nappointment of Arbitrator. The application was, however, withdrawn for\n\ntechnical reasons.\n\n8. On 15th January 2021, the Respondent filed a second arbitration petition\n\nunder \nSection 11\n sub-section (6) of the A&C Act being A.P. No.46/2021 in the\n\nCalcutta High Court. The Appellant filed an Affidavit in Opposition questioning\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court to decide the application\n\nunder \nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act.\n\n9. In the Affidavit in Opposition, the Appellant contended :\n\n “a) There is no valid or enforceable or existing Arbitration clause\n between the parties for reference of the disputes to Arbitration\n in terms of the said clause.\n\n b) …\n\n c) This Hon’ble Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try entertain\n\n and determine the instant application as the agreement\n between the Petitioner and the Respondent has been executed\n and registered in the office of the District Registrar,\n Muzaffarpur, in the district of Bihar.\n\n d) The subject matter of the agreement is for development and\n construction to be carried out of all that piece and parcel of\n land situated within the limits of Muzaffarpur Municipal\n Corporation, Bihar, outside the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble\n Court.\n\n e) No part of the cause of action for filing the present application\n\n\f 4\n\n has arisen within the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court and by\n reasons whereof the this Hon’ble Court has no territorial\n jurisdiction to try entertain and determine the present\n application.\n\n f) The building plan of the property in question has been duly\n sanctioned by the Muzaffarpur Municipal Corporation for\n construction of a property at Muzaffarpur. The disputes\n covered by the present reference relates to an immoveable\n construction of an immovable property in Muzaffarpur. This\n Hon’ble Court has no territorial jurisdiction to try entertain or\n determine the present application as this Hon’ble Court is not\n a court within the meaning of \nSection 2(i)(e)\n of the Arbitration\n and Conciliation Act, 1996. This Hon’ble Court is not the\n designated High Court for appointing an arbitrator in\n accordance with and in true scope and ambit of \nSection 11\n of\n the Act of 1996.\n\n g) …\n\n h) The subject matter of the present application is sub-judice\n before the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, Muzaffarpur\n under RERA Case No.56/377/2019 and the same is pending\n adjudication and by reasons whereof this Hon’ble Court has no\n jurisdiction to try entertain or determine the present\n application.\n\n i) It is submitted that mere place of sitting mentioned in an\n Arbitration agreement stating that the Arbitration will be held\n in Kolkata does not confer any jurisdiction on this Hon’ble\n Court to try entertain and determine the instant application.\n\n No part of the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction\n of this Hon’ble Court and by reasons whereof this Hon’ble\n Court has no jurisdiction to try entertain and determine the\n present application.”\n\n10. The Respondent duly filed an Affidavit in Reply. In the Affidavit in Reply,\n\nthe Respondent has merely denied that the Calcutta High Court lacks territorial\n\njurisdiction to entertain or decide the application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the\n\nA&C Act. It is admitted that the Development Agreement is in respect of\n\nproperty situated at Muzaffarpur in Bihar, outside the jurisdiction of Calcutta\n\nHigh Court. It is also admitted that the Development Agreement was executed\n\nand registered in the State of Bihar, outside the jurisdiction of Calcutta High\n\n\f 5\n\nCourt. It was contended that the Calcutta High Court exercises jurisdiction over\n\nthe place agreed upon as the seat of arbitration, and would thus have\n\njurisdiction to entertain the Arbitration proceedings. Paragraph 5-E of the\n\nAffidavit in Reply is set out hereinbelow for convenience :-\n\n “5-E It is submitted that though the agreement was\n executed outside the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court and the\n property in question is also located outside the Jurisdiction of\n this Hon’ble Court but as the Arbitration agreement contained in\n the said development agreement where parties have agreed to\n submit to the Jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court thereby, fixing it at\n Kolkata, then this Hon’ble Court has jurisdiction to try and entertain\n the instant lis. It is submitted that where a seat is designated in an\n agreement, the courts of the seat alone have jurisdiction which would\n require that all applications arising out of the arbitral agreement\n needs to be filed in the Court having jurisdiction over the seat of\n Arbitration, and that Court also will have jurisdiction to try the\n Arbitration petition. The Hon’ble Courts of this country have made it\n clear that the moment a seat is designated by agreement between\n the parties, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, which would\n then vest the courts at the ‘seat’ with exclusive jurisdiction for the\n purposes of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the\n agreement between the parties. Whenever there is the designation of\n a place of Arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the ‘venue’ of\n the Arbitration proceedings, the expression “Arbitration proceedings”\n would make it clear that the ‘venue’ is really the ‘seat’ of the arbitral\n proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or\n more individual or particular hearing. In view of the aforesaid\n development of law, there is no confusion with regard to what the\n seat of Arbitration and venue of Arbitration mean. There is no shadow\n of doubt that the Arbitration clause has to be read in a holistic manner\n so as to determine the jurisdiction of the Court. That apart, if there is\n mention of venue and something else is appended thereto, depending\n on the nature of the prescription, the Court can come to a conclusion\n that there is implied exclusion.”\n\n11. On 13th August 2021, the Calcutta High Court allowed the Arbitration\n\nPetition and appointed a retired judge of the Calcutta High Court as Sole\n\nArbitrator. Mr. Ajit Kumar Sinha, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Appellant submitted that even though the Appellant had opposed the\n\napplication under \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C Act, objecting to the territorial\n\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court, the Calcutta High Court did not decide\n\n\f 6\n\nthe objection. There is no finding by the Calcutta High Court with regard to its\n\njurisdiction. The order of the High Court reads:-\n\n “1. The present application has been filed under \nSection 11(6)(a)\n of\n the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of the\n arbitrator for settlement of the disputes between the parties.\n\n 2. At the time of hearing it was not disputed by the learned Counsel\n appearing for the parties that there is a valid arbitration clause in the\n development agreement.\n\n 3. Learned counsel for both the parties have agreed to appoint ... to\n resolve the disputes sought to be raised by both the parties.\n\n Accordingly, ... is appointed as arbitrator to settle the disputes\n between the parties.\n\n 4. The present application is accordingly disposed of.”\n\n12. Mr. Sinha submitted that Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant in\n\nthe Calcutta High Court gave consent without instructions from the Appellant.\n\nBe that as it may, the Calcutta High Court did not adjudicate the issue of\n\nterritorial jurisdiction raised by the Appellant in its Affidavit in Opposition filed in\n\nthe High Court.\n\n13. On or about 30th September 2021, the Appellant filed an application for\n\nreview of the final order dated 13th August 2021. In the application for review,\n\nthe Appellant took the following grounds:\n\n “I FOR THAT the order dated 13th August, 2021 discloses error\n apparent on the face of records and mistake inasmuch as the\n objections of the petitioner pertaining to the Hon'ble Court not having\n jurisdiction in the matter and the objections regarding non-arbitrability\n of the disputes involved, have not been considered by this Hon'ble\n Court.\n\n II. For THAT the order dated 13th August, 2021 discloses error\n apparent on the face of records, mistake inasmuch as the Hon'ble\n Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petitioner since the Hon'ble\n High Court at Patna had to be approached under \nsection 11\n of the\n\n\f 7\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996\n.\n\n xxx xxx xxx\n\n VII. FOR THAT the order dated 13th August, 2021 proceeding on\n concession of counsel which is contrary to the petitioners instructions\n discloses error apparent on the face of record.\n\n VIII. FOR THAT the petitioner has not instructed counsel to concede\n and has to the contrary instructed counsel to oppose the petition and\n therefore consent, if any, counsel is without jurisdiction and void and\n the order dated 13th August, 2021 proceeding on the basis of the\n same, discloses error apparent on the face of record.\n\n IX. FOR THAT there has no consent given by the petitioner and the\n order dated 13th August, 2021 proceeding on the basis of the consent,\n discloses error apparent on the face of records.”\n\n14. By the order dated 4th October 2021, the High Court dismissed the review\n\napplication, which is also impugned in this Court. The High Court held that\n\nconsent given by learned Counsel could not be permitted to be withdrawn.\n\n15. The question before this Court is, whether the Calcutta High Court at all\n\nhad jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the Respondent and appoint\n\nan Arbitrator. Mr. Sanjay Ghosh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe Respondent, argued with force, that the initial order of appointment of\n\nArbitrator was passed by the Court by consent. The Appellant appeared in the\n\narbitration proceedings. In other words, the Appellant acquiesced to the\n\nreference of the disputes to the Arbitrator appointed by the High Court.\n\n16. The Appellant did not accept the order of the Calcutta High Court. After\n\nthe High Court appointed the Arbitrator, the Appellant filed a review application,\n\ntaking objection to the jurisdiction of the High Court, which was rejected. On\n\nthe same day i.e. 4th October 2021, the Arbitrator passed an interim order\n\nrestraining the Appellant from creating any third party interest in the property.\n\n\f 8\n\n17. The minutes of the proceedings before the learned Arbitrator appointed\n\nby the Calcutta High Court does not indicate that the Appellant willingly\n\nsubmitted to arbitration by the learned Arbitrator. The Appellant only agreed to\n\nthe fees of the Arbitrator appointed by the High Court. This Court cannot be\n\noblivious to practical realities, such as embarrassment of Counsel to oppose the\n\nfees of an Arbitrator who happens to be a former Judge of the High Court.\n\n18. Mr. Sinha rightly argued that an order without jurisdiction can be\n\nquestioned at any time at any stage irrespective of any consent that may have\n\nbeen given by the Counsel, which the Appellant asserts, was without\n\ninstructions of the Appellant.\n\n19. \nIn \nKiran Singh and Ors. v. Chaman Paswan and Ors.1\n, a four Judge\n\nBench of this Court held that it is a fundamental principle, well-established, that\n\na decree passed by a Court without jurisdiction is a nullity, and that its invalidity\n\ncould be set up whenever and wherever it is sought to be enforced or relied\n\nupon, even at the stage of execution and even in collateral proceedings. A\n\ndefect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in\n\nrespect of the subject matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the\n\nCourt to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by\n\nconsent of the parties.\n\n20. The question in this case is, whether the Calcutta High Court had\n\nterritorial jurisdiction to pass the impugned orders. The answer to the question\n\nhas to be in the negative for the reason that the Development Agreement was\n\nadmittedly executed and registered outside the jurisdiction of the High Court of\n\nCalcutta, the agreement pertains to development of property located in\n1 (1955) SCR 117 : AIR 1954 SC 340\n\n\f 9\n\nMuzaffarpur outside jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. The Appellant has\n\nits registered office in Patna outside the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court. The\n\nAppellant has no establishment and does not carry on any business within the\n\njurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. As admitted by the Respondent, no part\n\nof the cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court.\n\n21. Mr. Sinha referred to the definition of Court in \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the A&C\n\nAct, set out hereinbelow for convenience:\n\n “2. Definitions.—(1) In this Part, unless the context otherwise requires,\n —\n\n (a) to (d) …\n\n (e) “Court” means— (i) in the case of an arbitration other than\n international commercial arbitration, the principal Civil Court of\n original jurisdiction in a district, and includes the High Court in\n exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to\n decide the questions forming the subject-matter of the arbitration if\n the same had been the subject-matter of a suit, but does not include\n any Civil Court of a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court, or any\n Court of Small Causes; (ii) in the case of international commercial\n arbitration, the High Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil\n jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the\n subject-matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject-\n\n matter of a suit, and in other cases, a High Court having jurisdiction to\n hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to that High Court;\n\n22. As argued by Mr. Sinha, the word ‘Court’ has been defined, in case of an\n\narbitration other than international commercial arbitration, to mean the\n\nprincipal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and would include the\n\nHigh Court in exercise of its ordinary original jurisdiction, having jurisdiction to\n\ndecide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration, if the same\n\nhad been the subject matter of the suit, but it does not include any Civil Court\n\nof a grade inferior to such principal Civil Court or any Court of small causes.\n\n\f 10\n\n23. Subject to the pecuniary or other limitations prescribed by any law, suits\n\nfor recovery of immovable property or determination of any other right to or\n\ninterest in an immovable property or compensation for wrong to immovable\n\nproperty, is to be instituted in the Court, within the local limits of whose\n\njurisdiction, the property is situated. Certain specific suits relating to immovable\n\nproperty can be instituted either in the Court within the limits of whose\n\njurisdiction the property is situated, or in the Court within the local limits of\n\nwhose jurisdiction the Defendant actually or voluntarily resides or carries on\n\nbusiness.\n\n24. All other suits are to be instituted in a Court, within the local limits of\n\nwhose jurisdiction the Defendant voluntarily resides or carries on business.\n\nWhere there is more than one Defendant, a suit may be instituted in the Court\n\nwithin whose jurisdiction any of the Defendants voluntarily resides or carries on\n\nbusiness. A suit may also be instituted in a Court within whose jurisdiction the\n\ncause of action arises either wholly or in part.\n\n25. In the present case, no suit could have been filed in any Court over which\n\nthe Calcutta High Court exercises jurisdiction, since as stated above, the suit\n\nadmittedly pertains to immovable property situated at Muzaffarpur in Bihar,\n\noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court and admittedly, no\n\npart of the cause of action had arisen within the territorial jurisdiction of the\n\nCalcutta High Court. The Appellant who would be in the position of Defendant\n\nin a suit, neither resides nor carries on any business within the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Calcutta High Court.\n\n26. Of course, under \nSection 11(6)\n, an application for appointment of an\n\nArbitrator necessarily has to be moved in the High Court, irrespective of\n\n\f 11\n\nwhether the High Court has the jurisdiction to decide a suit in respect of the\n\nsubject matter of arbitration and irrespective of whether the High Court at all\n\nhas original jurisdiction to entertain and decide suits. As such, the definition of\n\nCourt in \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the A&C Act would not be applicable in the case of a\n\nHigh Court exercising jurisdiction under \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C Act to appoint\n\nan Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n27. At the same time, an application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C Act for\n\nappointment of an Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal cannot be moved in any High\n\nCourt in India, irrespective of its territorial jurisdiction. \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C\n\nAct has to be harmoniously read with \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the A&C Act and\n\nconstrued to mean, a High Court which exercises superintendence/supervisory\n\njurisdiction over a Court within the meaning of \nSection 2(1)(e)\n of the A&C Act.\n\n28. It could never have been the intention of \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C Act that\n\narbitration proceedings should be initiated in any High Court in India,\n\nirrespective of whether the Respondent resided or carried on business within\n\nthe jurisdiction of that High Court, and irrespective of whether any part of the\n\ncause of action arose within the jurisdiction of that Court, to put an opponent at\n\na disadvantage and steal a march over the opponent.\n\n29. Mr. Sinha also relied on \nSection 42\n of the A&C Act set out hereinbelow:\n\n “42. Jurisdiction.— Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in\n this Part or in any other law for the time being in force, where with\n respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part\n has been made in a Court, that Court alone shall have jurisdiction\n over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising\n out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in\n that Court and in no other Court.”\n\n\f 12\n\n30. Mr. Sinha emphasized on \nSection 42\n of the A&C Act to argue that an\n\nearlier application for interim protection having been moved at the District\n\nCourt at Muzaffarpur, the Respondent could not have invoked the jurisdiction of\n\nthe Calcutta High Court.\n\n31. There could be no doubt, as argued by Mr. Sinha, that \nSection 42\n of the\n\nA&C Act is mandatory. The Section has obviously been enacted to prevent the\n\nparties from being dragged into proceedings in different Courts, when more\n\nthan one Court has jurisdiction. Where with respect to any arbitration\n\nagreement, any application under Part I of the A&C Act has been made in a\n\nCourt, that Court alone would have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings\n\nand all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement, and the arbitral\n\nproceedings, would have to be made in that Court and in no other Court, unless,\n\nof course, the Court in which the first application had been instituted, inherently\n\nlacked jurisdiction to entertain that application. The Section which starts with a\n\nnon obstante clause, is binding irrespective of any other law for the time being\n\nin force, and irrespective of any other provision in Part I of the A&C Act.\n\n32. However, \nSection 42\n cannot possibly have any application to an\n\napplication under \nSection 11(6)\n, which necessarily has to be made before a\n\nHigh Court, unless the earlier application was also made in a High Court. In the\n\ninstant case, the earlier application under \nSection 9\n was made in the District\n\nCourt at Muzaffarpur and not in the High Court of Judicature at Patna. An\n\napplication under \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C Act for appointment of Arbitrator,\n\ncould not have been made in the District Court of Muzaffarpur. Therefore,\n\nSection 42\n is not attracted.\n\n\f 13\n\n33. In the Affidavit in Reply filed in the High Court, the Respondent contended\n\nthat the parties to the Arbitration Agreement had agreed to submit to the\n\njurisdiction of Calcutta High Court. The Arbitration Agreement entered into by\n\nthe parties clearly states that the seat and/or the place of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nshall be Kolkata.\n\n34. Mr. Sanjay Ghosh, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nRespondents submitted that the Calcutta High Court had the territorial\n\njurisdiction to entertain the application under \nSection 11(6)\n of the A&C Act as\n\nthe seat of arbitration was Kolkata.\n\n35. \nIn support of his argument that the Calcutta High Court had exclusive\n\njurisdiction to entertain and decide the application under \nSection 11(6)\n filed by\n\nthe Respondent, Mr. Ghosh cited \nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\n\nv. Datawind Innovations Private Limited and Ors.\n 2, \nHindustan\n\nConstruction Company Limited v. NHPC Limited and Anr.\n 3 and \nBGS SGS\n\nSoma JV v. NHPC Limited4\n and argued that once a seat of arbitration is\n\ndesignated, the clause designating the seat of arbitration becomes an exclusive\n\njurisdiction clause, as a result of which, only the Courts within whose territorial\n\nlimits, the seat is located would have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other\n\nCourts.\n\n36. \nIn \nIndus Mobile Distribution Private Limited\n (supra), this Court\n\nreferred to and relied upon the dictum of a Constitution Bench of this Court in\n\nBharat Aluminium Company v. Kaiser Aluminium\n 5 and held that once the\n\nseat of arbitration had been fixed, that would be in the nature of an exclusive\n\n2 (2017) 7 SCC 678\n3 (2020) 4 SCC 310\n4 (2020) 4 SCC 234\n5 (2012) 9 SCC 552\n\n\f 14\n\njurisdiction clause, binding the parties to specific Courts which alone could\n\nexercise supervisory powers over the arbitration.\n \nIn \nBharat Aluminium\n\nCompany\n (supra) what was in issue before the Constitution Bench was the\n\nmeaning of the expression “place of arbitration” in the context of \nSection 2(2)\n of\n\nthe A&C Act, which as amended by Act 33 of 2019 is set out hereinbelow:\n\n “(2) This Part shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India.\n 3[Provided that subject to an agreement to the contrary, the\n provisions of \nSections 9\n, \n27\n and \n4\n[clause (b)] of sub-section (1)\n and sub-section (3) of \nSection 37\n shall also apply to international\n commercial arbitration, even if the place of arbitration is outside\n India, and an arbitral award made or to be made in such place is\n enforceable and recognised under the provisions of Part II of this\n Act.]”\n\n37. The question before the Constitution Bench was whether of Part-I of the\n\nA&C Act applied to arbitrations, where the place of arbitration was outside India.\n\n38. As observed by the Constitution Bench, \nSection 2(2)\n of the A&C Act places\n\na threshold limitation on the applicability of Part-I, where the place of arbitration\n\nis not in India. The Constitution Bench in effect and substance drew a\n\ndistinction between venue and place of arbitration, as contemplated in \nSection\n\n20\n and held that only if the agreement of the parties was construed to provide\n\nfor seat/place of arbitration in India, would Part-I of the 1996 Act be applicable.\n\nIf the seat/place were outside India, Part-I would not apply, even though the\n\nvenue of a few sittings may have been in India, or the cause of action may have\n\narisen in India.\n\n39. The judgment of this Court in \nBGS SGS Soma JV\n (supra) cited by Mr.\n\nSanjay Ghosh, was also rendered in the context of \nSection 2(2)\n of the A&C Act\n\nand the applicability of Part I of the A&C Act to an international commercial\n\narbitration, where the seat of arbitration was not in India.\n\n\f 15\n\n40. \nIn \nHindustan Construction Company Limited\n (supra), this Court held\n\nthat once the seat of arbitration is designated, the same operates as an\n\nexclusive jurisdiction clause and only Courts within whose jurisdiction the seat\n\nwas located, would have jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other Courts. In the\n\nfacts and circumstances of that case this Court found that Courts at New Delhi\n\nalone would have jurisdiction for the purpose of challenge to the Award.\n\n41. It is well settled that a judgment is a precedent for the issue of law that is\n\nraised and decided. The judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the\n\nfacts and circumstances in which the judgment has been rendered. Words,\n\nphrases and sentences in a judgment, cannot be read out of context. Nor is a\n\njudgment to be read and interpreted in the manner of a statute. It is only the\n\nlaw as interpreted by in an earlier judgment, which constitutes a binding\n\nprecedent, and not everything that the Judges say.\n\n42. It can never be an absolute general proposition of law, that where an\n\narbitration agreement says that the place of arbitration is Faridabad/Delhi and\n\nproceedings under Part I of the A&C Act are also validly initiated in Faridabad,\n\nthe Court in Faridabad would, notwithstanding \nSection 42\n of the A&C Act, lose\n\nits jurisdiction, just because arbitration is later conducted in Delhi and Award is\n\nmade in Delhi.\n\n43. This Court has perused the Development Agreement. The contention of\n\nthe Respondent in the Affidavit in Opposition, that the parties to the arbitration\n\nagreement had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court, is\n\nnot correct. The parties to the arbitration agreement only agreed that the\n\nsittings of the Arbitral Tribunal would be in Kolkata. Kolkata was the venue for\n\nholding the sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n\f 16\n\n44. \nIn \nUnion of India v. Hardy Exploration and Production (India) Inc.\n 6\n\na three Judge Bench of this Court held that the sittings at various places are\n\nrelatable to venue. It cannot be equated with the seat of arbitration or place of\n\narbitration, which has a different connotation.\n\n45. \nIn \nMankastu Impex Private Limited v. Airvisual Limited7\n a three\n\nJudge Bench of which one of us (Hon. A.S. Bopanna, J) was a member, held:\n\n “19. The seat of arbitration is a vital aspect of any arbitration\n proceedings. Significance of the seat of arbitration is that it\n determines the applicable law when deciding the arbitration\n proceedings and arbitration procedure as well as judicial review over\n the arbitration award. The situs is not just about where an institution\n is based or where the hearings will be held. But it is all about which\n court would have the supervisory power over the arbitration\n proceedings. \nIn \nEnercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH [Enercon (India)\n Ltd.\n v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] , the\n Supreme Court held that : (SCC pp. 43 & 46, paras 97 & 107)\n “[T]he location of the seat will determine the courts that will have\n exclusive jurisdiction to oversee the arbitration proceedings. It\n was further held that the seat normally carries with it the choice\n of that country's arbitration/curial law.”\n\n 20. It is well settled that “seat of arbitration” and “venue of\n arbitration” cannot be used interchangeably. It has also been\n established that mere expression “place of arbitration” cannot be the\n basis to determine the intention of the parties that they have\n intended that place as the “seat” of arbitration. The intention of the\n parties as to the “seat” should be determined from other clauses in\n the agreement and the conduct of the parties.”\n\n46. In this case, the Development Agreement provided that the sittings of the\n\nArbitral Tribunal would be conducted in Kolkata. As observed above, the parties\n\nnever agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court in respect of\n\ndisputes, nor did the parties agree upon Kolkata as the seat of arbitration.\n\nKolkata was only the venue for sittings of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n6 (2019) 13 SCC 472\n7 (2020) 5 SCC 399\n\n\f 17\n\n47. It is well settled that, when two or more Courts have jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate disputes arising out of an arbitration agreement, the parties might,\n\nby agreement, decide to refer all disputes to any one Court to the exclusion of\n\nall other Courts, which might otherwise have had jurisdiction to decide the\n\ndisputes. The parties cannot, however, by consent, confer jurisdiction on a\n\nCourt which inherently lacked jurisdiction, as argued by Mr. Sinha.\n\n48. In this case, the parties, as observed above did not agree to refer their\n\ndisputes to the jurisdiction of the Courts in Kolkata. It was not the intention of\n\nthe parties that Kolkata should be the seat of arbitration. Kolkata was only\n\nintended to be the venue for arbitration sittings. Accordingly, the Respondent\n\nhimself approached the District Court at Muzaffarpur, and not a Court in Kolkata\n\nfor interim protection under \nSection 9\n of the A&C Act. The Respondent having\n\nhimself invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court at Muzaffarpur, is estopped\n\nfrom contending that the parties had agreed to confer exclusive jurisdiction to\n\nthe Calcutta High Court to the exclusion of other Courts. Neither of the parties\n\nto the agreement construed the arbitration clause to designate Kolkata as the\n\nseat of arbitration. We are constrained to hold that Calcutta High Court\n\ninherently lacks jurisdiction to entertain the application of the Respondent under\n\nSection 11(6)\n of the Arbitration Act. The High Court should have decided the\n\nobjection raised by the Appellant, to the jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court,\n\nto entertain the application under \nSection 11(6)\n of A&C Act, before appointing\n\nan Arbitrator.\n\n49. These appeals are therefore, allowed and the impugned orders of\n\nappointment of Arbitrator and dismissal of the review application are set aside.\n\n\f 18\n\nThe appointment of the learned Arbitrator is set aside on the ground that the\n\norder of his appointment is without jurisdiction and in view of the objection to\n\nhis appointment raised by the Appellant. It is made absolutely clear that this\n\norder is not to be construed as any aspersion on the learned Arbitrator\n\nappointed by the Calcutta High Court, or the manner in which he has conducted\n\nthe proceedings so far.\n\n50. Since the meetings of the Arbitral Tribunal are to be held in Kolkata, this\n\nCourt deems it appropriate to appoint Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya, Former\n\nChief Justice of the High Court of Gujarat as Sole Arbitrator, to decide the\n\ndisputes between the parties. The parties have consented to the appointment\n\nof Justice Bhaskar Bhattarcharya.\n\n51. The status quo with regard to the property in question shall be maintained\n\nfor a period of 15 days from today to enable the respective parties to approach\n\nthe learned Arbitrator under \nSection 17\n of the A&C Act, for interim relief in\n\naccordance with law.\n\n …...……………………………,J.\n\n (INDIRA BANERJEE)\n\n …...……………………………,J.\n\n (A.S.

It is submitted that where a seat is designated in an\n agreement, the courts of the seat alone have jurisdiction which would\n require that all applications arising out of the arbitral agreement\n needs to be filed in the Court having jurisdiction over the seat of\n Arbitration, and that Court also will have jurisdiction to try the\n Arbitration petition. The Hon’ble Courts of this country have made it\n clear that the moment a seat is designated by agreement between\n the parties, it is akin to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, which would\n then vest the courts at the ‘seat’ with exclusive jurisdiction for the\n purposes of regulating arbitral proceedings arising out of the\n agreement between the parties. Whenever there is the designation of\n a place of Arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the ‘venue’ of\n the Arbitration proceedings, the expression “Arbitration proceedings”\n would make it clear that the ‘venue’ is really the ‘seat’ of the arbitral\n proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or\n more individual or particular hearing. In view of the aforesaid\n development of law, there is no confusion with regard to what the\n seat of Arbitration and venue of Arbitration mean. There is no shadow\n of doubt that the Arbitration clause has to be read in a holistic manner\n so as to determine the jurisdiction of the Court. That apart, if there is\n mention of venue and something else is appended thereto, depending\n on the nature of the prescription, the Court can come to a conclusion\n that there is implied exclusion.”"
