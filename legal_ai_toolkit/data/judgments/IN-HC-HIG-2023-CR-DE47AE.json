Facts and circumstances giving rise to this application\nare that, the second respondent - Mahendra Panchal,\nresident of Mumbai is brother of deceased\nHasmukhbhai, who ended his life by committing\nsuicide at his village Gadalvada, Dist. Banaskantha.\nThe deceased was driving a rickshaw for his livelihood.\nThe deceased had borrowed Rs.6 lacs from accused\nNos.1 to 10 and was paying unbearable amount of\ninterest. It is the case of the prosecution that the\ndeceased could not repay the principal amount as well\nas the interest, as a result, he was under tremendous\npressure and distress. Before he could commit suicide,\nhe wrote a letter addressed to PSI, Gadh Police Station,\nmentioning therein the harassment meted out to him\nby the accused, on the issue of borrowed money. In the\nletter, he mentioned names of 10 persons including the\napplicants, alleging therein that after borrowing the\nmoney from them, he could not repay the same and\nupon his request to give some time to repay the\namount, they have not extended the time and\n\nPage 2 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\nthreatened him to take away his rickshaw and did not\nallow him to do his business. He had further mentioned\nin the letter that he is going to end his life by\ncommitting suicide and all the persons mentioned in\nthe letter are responsible for my suicide. In this\ncircumstance, on 19.04.2016, the deceased\nHasmukhbhai had consumed poisonous substance and\ncommitted suicide. Before he could die, he was taken to\nPalanpur Civil Hospital where his statement in form of\ndying declaration was recorded by the Executive\nMagistrate, Palanpur, wherein, he disclosed the facts of\nborrowed money allegedly taken from persons named in\nthe statement. The names of the present applicants\nhaving not been disclosed as the deceased while\nrecording the statement did not recollect their names.\nThe investigating officer had also recorded the\nstatement of the deceased on the same day under\n\nSection 161\nof the Cr.P.C., wherein, the reasons for his\nsuicide having been disclosed before the police and\nsubsequently, he died at Civil Hospital. The brother of\nthe deceased Mr. Mahendra Panchal went to hospital\nand he was appraised by the relatives about the\nfinancial distress of the deceased and factum of suicide\nnote and dying declaration. The second respondent\nbased on the input gathered by him at the hospital,\nlodged an FIR against 10 persons, including the\napplicants herein for the offences as referred above.\nAfter completion of investigation of the case, the IO filed\n\nPage 3 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\na chargesheet against the accused for the aforesaid\noffences, which has been culminated into Sessions\nCase No.78/2022, which is pending before the\njurisdictional sessions Court at Banaskantha.\n\n3. The applicants arraigned as accused Nos. 8 and 9 in\nthe chargesheet. They have preferred present quashing\npetition mainly on the ground that the charge against\nthem under\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code is not\nsustainable. Therefore, continuation of the proceedings\nagainst them is nothing, but a sheer abuse of process\nof law and Court.\n\n4. Mr. Tejas Barot, learned counsel appearing for the\napplicants on instructions does not press this petition\nqua the offences punishable under\nSections 506 (2)\n,\n,\n,\n,\nof Indian Penal Code and\nSections\nand\nof the Gujarat Money Lenders Act and\nconfined to this petition so far offence under Section\n306 read with\nSection 34\nof Indian Penal Code is\nconcerned. The petition stands dismissed qua the\naforesaid offences except Section 306 read with\nSection\nof Indian Penal Code.\n\n5. This Court has heard Mr. Tejas Barot, learned counsel\nfor the applicants, Mr. K.P.Champaneri, learned\ncounsel for the original informant and Ms. Vrunda\nShah, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the\nrespondent State.\n\nPage 4 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\n6. Mr. Tejas Barot, the counsel appearing for the\napplicants submitted that the FIR lacks the ingredients\nof the offences alleged, more particularly\nsection 306\nof\nIndian Penal Code; that, the facts and circumstances of\nthe case do not, in any way, indicate that the alleged\nact would constitute abetment to commit suicide; that\nthere is complete absence of any sort of instigation or\nany positive move on the part of the applicants, causing\nthe deceased to commit suicide; that the ingredients of\nabetment as laid down in\nSection 107\nof Indian Penal\nCode is completely absent in this case and as such,\n\nsection 306\nof Indian Penal Code is not at all attracted;\nthat a bare reading of the suicide note and facts\ndisclosed in dying declaration does not itself amount to\ninstigation and also does not reflect mens rea on the\npart of the applicants which is necessary concomitant\nof investigation (Sanju @ Sanjay Singh Sengar Vs. State\nof M.P., AIR 1998 SC 2002); that there was no material\nto suggest that there was intention on the part of the\napplicants to provoke incite or encourage the deceased\nin committing the suicide and therefore, in absence of\nany material with respect of the charge of abetment of\nsuicide, merely allegations of harassment disclosed in\nthe suicide note and dying declaration are not sufficient\nto draw inference that the accused have abetted in the\ncommission of suicide.\n\nPage 5 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\n7.\nIn support of the aforesaid contentions, reliance has\nbeen placed on the judgment of the Apex Court in\n\nM.Arjun Vs. State\nrepresented by its Inspector of Police\n(2019) 3 SCC 315, to contend that having advanced\nmoney to the deceased by applicant accused might\nhave occurred dispute with regard to repayment of\nmoney, but that by itself is not sufficient to constitute\noffence under\nSec. 306\nof Indian Penal Code as there\nshould be evidence capable of suggesting that the\naccused intended by such acts to instigate deceased to\ncommit suicide.\n\n8. In the aforesaid contentions submitted by learned\ncounsel for the applicant Mr. Barot, he thus urged that\nthe FIR so far as charge under Section 306 is\nconcerned having been filed with ulterior motive and to\nharass the applicants and when prima facie no case is\nmade out against the accused for the alleged offence,\nthen the continuation of trial proceedings would\nunnecessarily harassment to the applicants which\namount to abuse of process of law and Court and\ntherefore, he prayed that the case is made out to\nexercise inherent powers to quash the FIR and\nconsequential proceedings therefrom.\n\n9. On the other hand, countering to the contentions\nraised by the applicant, learned counsel Mr.\n\nPage 6 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\nK.P.Chanpaneri and State counsel Ms. Vrunda Shah\nsubmitted that, after registration of FIR, the IO\nrecovered the material evidence like suicide note, dying\ndeclaration of the deceased and considering the\nsufficient evidence for the commission of alleged\noffence, the I.O filed a chargesheet for the offences as\n\nreferred above\n. Thus, at this stage it cannot be said\nthat no prima facie case is made out against the\napplicant; that the criminal proceedings cannot be\nquashed where the allegations made in the FIR and\nchargesheet disclosed the commission of offence; that\nthe High Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Section\n482 is required to be examined whether the averments\nmade in the FIR and chargesheet case papers\nconstitute the ingredients necessary for an offence\nalleged under\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code; that in\nthe present case, the allegations as they stand make\nout an offence within the meaning of\nSection 306\nof\nIndian Penal Code; that the deceased was under\n\ntremendous stress of the pressure of the accused and it\nwas to the extent that they tried to take away his\nrickshaw and restrained to do his livelihood work that\nis what mentioned in the suicide note by the deceased;\nthat this is not a stage where the minutes and\nmeticulous exercise with regard to appreciation of\nevidence may be done. Thus, therefore, it was urged\nthat at this stage the High Court is not justified in\nembarking upon an inquiry as to the probability,\n\nPage 7 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\nreliability or genuineness of the allegations made\ntherein and same is required to be considered at the\nstage of trial.\n\n10.\nIn support of the aforesaid contentions, reliance has\nbeen placed by Mr. Champaneri on the judgment of the\nApex Court rendered in\nPravin Pradhan Vs. State of\nUttaranchal\n[(2012) 9 SCC 734], to contend that an\naccused by continuing course of these conduct creates\nsuch circumstances that the deceased was left with no\nother option, but to commit suicide which would satisfy\nthe ingredients of instigation to commit suicide.\n\n11. In the aforesaid contentions, learned counsel for the\ncomplainant Mr. Champaneri and State Counsel Ms.\nShah submitted that the inherent powers vest with the\nHigh Court do not confer jurisdiction to act according\nto whim and caprice and the same is exercised\nsparingly with circumspection and in the rarest of rare\ncases. Thus, therefore, it was submitted that no\nexceptional case is made out to exercise inherent\npowers of this Court to quash the criminal proceedings\nand the application is liable to be dismissed.\n\n12. The applicants herein have been charged for the act of\nabetment of suicide and other provisions as referred in\npara 1 of this judgment. It is the case of the\nprosecution that, deceased had borrowed money for\npersonal use from different persons as referred in the\n\nPage 8 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\nsuicide note and statement of the deceased in form of\ndying declaration. The complainant who happens to be\na brother of the deceased having no any personal\nknowledge with respect to alleged financial\ntransactions. He has lodged the FIR based on the\nfactum of suicide note and dying declaration. In such\ncircumstances, the issue falls for determination of this\nCourt is whether the FIR and consequential\nproceedings are liable to be quashed in exercise of\nextraordinary and inherent jurisdiction.\n\n13. It is settled law that the High Courts are clothed with\ninherent powers to make such orders as may be\nnecessary for the ends of justice. Such power though\nunrestricted and undefined should not be capriciously\nor arbitrarily exercised but should be exercised in\nappropriate cases, ex debito justitiae to do real and\nsubstantial justice for administration of which alone\nthe court exists as the powers possess by the High\nCourt under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and\nvery plantitude which requires great caution in exercise\nand same has to be exercised sparingly with\ncircumspection and in the rarest of rare case.\nIn the\ncase of\nV.P.Srivastava Vs. Indian Explosives Ltd\n.\n\n2010 (10) SCC 361, the Apex Court while dealing with\nthe issue of quashing and inherent powers of the High\nCourt, held that where no prima facie case is made out,\ninvolving the applicant accused in the alleged offence,\n\nPage 9 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\nthen the High Court is obliged in law to exercise the\njurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code.\n\n14. Reverting back to the facts of the present case, names\nof the applicants disclosed by the deceased in his\nsuicide note and further their names had not been\ndisclosed in the statement of the deceased recorded in\nform of dying declaration as he could not recollect their\nnames. The charge against the applicants is under\n\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code for the offence of\nabetment of suicide. To bring home the accused for the\ncharge under Section 306, the prosecution has to prove\n\n(i) the deceased committed suicide (ii) the accused\ninstigated or abetted for committing suicide and (iii)\ndirect involvement by the accused in such abetment or\ninstigation is necessary.\nSection 107\nof Indian Penal\nCode defines abetment as comprising (a) instigation to\ncommit the offence (b) engaging in conspiracy to\ncommit the offence and (c) aiding the commission of\noffence. The scope and ambit of Section 107 and its co-\nrelation with\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code has\nbeen settled by catena of decisions of the Apex Court.\n\nIn\nKishori Lal Vs. State of M.P.\n, 2007 (10) SCC 797,\nthe two judge Bench of the Apex Court in para 6, while\ndefining the abetment of things held as under:-\n\n\"Section107IPC defines abetment of a thing. The\noffence of abetment is a separate and distinct offence\nprovided in the Act as an offence. A person, abets the\ndoing of a thing when (1) he instigates any person to\ndo that thing; or (2) engages with one or more other\n\nPage 10 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\npersons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing;\nor (3) intentionally aids, by act or illegal omission, the\ndoing of that thing. These things are essential to\ncomplete abetment as a crime. The word \"instigate\"\n\nliterally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring\nabout by persuasion to do any thing. The abetment\nmay be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid,\nas provided in the three clauses of Section\n\n107. Section 109provides that if the act abetted is\ncommitted in consequence of abetment and there is\nno provision for the punishment of such abetment,\nthen the offender is to be punished with the\npunishment provided for the original offence.\n'Abetted' in Section 109 means the specific offence\nabetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of\nwhich a person is charged with the abetment is\nnormally linked with the proved offence.\"\n\n15.\nIn\nM. Mohan Vs. State\n2011 (3) SCC 626, the Apex\nCourt while dealing with the abetment, in para 44 and\n45 observed thus:-\n\n\"45. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a\nperson or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a\nthing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to\ninstigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot\nbe sustained.\n\n46. The intention of the Legislature and the ratio of the\ncases decided by this court are clear that in order to\nconvict a person under\nsection 306\nIPC there has to be a\nclear mens rea to commit the offence. It also requires an\nactive act or direct act which led the deceased to commit\nsuicide seeing no option and this act must have been\nintended to push the deceased into such a position that\nhe/she committed suicide.\"\n\n16. In the facts of the present case, it emerges that the\ndeceased borrowed a total amount of Rs.6 lacs from 10\npersons. In the suicide note, on which date and what\n\nPage 11 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\namount the applicants herein had lent having not been\ndisclosed by the deceased. Even in dying declaration as\nwell as the statement recorded under\nSection 161\nof\nCr.P.C., there is no specific disclosure that how much\namount and on which date, the applicants had lent the\nmoney to the deceased. The allegations of harassment\nand preventing the deceased in doing his business of\nrickshaw driving seem to be general in nature and\nvague. No specific allegations made against the\napplicants that they individually subjected mental\nharassment on the issue of finance advanced by them.\nIn such circumstances, prima facie it appears that the\ndeceased was in depression as he could not repay the\nhandy loan obtained from various persons, as a result,\nhe decided to end his life and accordingly, he\ncommitted a suicide by consuming poisonous\nsubstance. Thus, considering the factual aspects as\ndiscussed above and in light of legal proposition on the\nissue of \"abetment of suicide\", this Court is of\nconsidered opinion that a casual remark that is likely\nto cause harassment in ordinary course of thing, made\nagainst the applicants would not fall within the term\n\"instigation\". Thus, the contents of the suicide note and\nthe statement of the deceased, prima facie does not\nanyway disclosed any incriminating information in the\nnature of instigation, provocation, compelling the\ndeceased to commit suicide. If we read the entire\nchargesheet case papers, this Court does not find live\n\nPage 12 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\nlink or proximity link between the act of accused and\nact of committing suicide as nothing specifically\ndisclosed by the deceased that how much amount the\naccused have lent him or how and on which date, they\nthreatened him and restrained him in doing his\nbusiness of rickshaw driving. In such circumstances,\nwhat role they had played in the act of instigation and\nhow they aided the deceased to commit suicide, having\nnot been established.\n\n17. The contention of the first informant that the facts\ndisclosed in the suicide note and material collected\nduring the course of investigation would suggest that\ndeceased had no option and was frustrated by the\ncontinuous act of instigation allegedly done by the\naccused and therefore, prima facie the offence under\nSection 306 is made out against the accused and in\nsupport of his submission, reliance has been placed on\nthe decision of the Apex Court in\nPravin Pradhan\n\n(supra).\n\nThis Court is of considered view that the\nsuicide note referred in the case of\nPravin Pradhan\n\n(supra) and considering the peculiar facts of the cited\ncase, the Apex Court was of the view that the prima\nfacie case is made out against the accused.\n\nThe facts of\nthe present case are totally on different footing and the\nfacts of suicide note are also totally different to the case\nof\nPravin Pradhan\n(supra). Thus, cited case is\ndistinguisable on factual aspects and the same is not\n\nPage 13 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\napplicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore,\nthis Court is of considered view that when there is no\nprima facie case made out for the offence under\nSection\nof Indian Penal Code, then continuation of\nproceedings would amount to harassment to the\napplicants and abuse of process of law and Court. In\nsuch circumstances, the contention raised by the\ncounsel for the original informant cannot be accepted.\n\n18. In the foregoing reasons, this Court is of prima facie\nview that this Court is unable to find anything in the\nFIR or chargesheet case papers which could suggest\nthat the applicants had instigated the deceased to\ncommit a suicide. This court is in total agreement with\nthe contentions raised by learned counsel for the\napplicants that lending money and asking it to back\nwould not be a ground to hold the applicants\nresponsible for instigation or aiding to the deceased to\ncommit suicide as mere allegations of harassment\nwithout there being any positive act or criminal intent\non the part of the applicants. In such circumstances,\nconsidering the peculiar facts and circumstances of the\npresent case, if the allegations for the charge of offence\nunder\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code are accepted as\nit is, do not prima facie constitute an offence under\n\nSection 306\nof Indian Penal Code against the applicants\nherein.\n\nPage 14 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023\n\nR/CR.MA/11161/2016 JUDGMENT DATED: 23/05/2023\n\n19. Hence, this is a fit case to exercise inherent power to\nquash the proceedings of FIR and other consequential\nproceedings thereof, so far as offences under\nSection\nand\nof Indian Penal Code are concerned.\nIn the\ncase of\nIshwarpratap Singh Vs. State of Uttar\nPradesh\n, [2018 (13) SCC 612], the Apex Court held\nthat there is no prohibition under the law for quashing\nthe chargesheet in part. The jurisdictional Court\nconcerned shall proceed further so far other offences\nregistered against the applicants as referred in para 1\nof this judgment in accordance with law.\n\n20. Accordingly, present application is partly allowed. FIR\nbeing I-C.R.No. 25/2016 registered with Gadh Police\nStation, Dist: Banaskantha and other consequential\nproceedings arising therefrom only for the offences\nunder Sections 306 read with 34 of\nIndian Penal Code\n,\nare quashed qua the applicants herein. Rule is made\nabsolute to the aforesaid extent.\n\nSd/-\n\n(ILESH J. VORA,J)\n\nSUCHIT\n\nPage 15 of 15\n\nDownloaded on : Thu May 25 20:36:07 IST 2023",
