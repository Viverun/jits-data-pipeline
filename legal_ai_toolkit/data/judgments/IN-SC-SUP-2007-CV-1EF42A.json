MATHUR & TARUN CHATTERJEE\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nJ U D G M E N T\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1242 OF 2007\n[Arising out of SLP [Crl] No. 6334 of 2004]\n\nTARUN CHATTERJEE, J.\n\n1. Leave granted.\n\n2. This appeal by special leave is preferred against the\njudgment and order dated 14th September, 2004 of the\nHigh Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur Bench,\nwhereby the High Court had quashed an FIR dated 31st\nDecember, 2001 lodged at the instance of the appellant in\nthe exercise of its inherent powers under\nSection 482\nof\nCode of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as\n\u0011the Code\u0012). The said FIR was registered by the\ncomplainant/appellant (in short \u0013the appellant\u0014) against\nthe accused/respondents (in short \u0013the respondents\u0014) for\nthe alleged offences under\nSection 498-A\nand\nof IPC.\n\n3. Before we take up the questions that were posed\n\nbefore us by the learned counsel for the parties, it is\nnecessary at this stage to state the facts giving rise to the\nfiling of this appeal. Accordingly, the facts in a nutshell are\nstated below :\n\n4. The appellant had entered into wedlock with the\nrespondent No.2 on 25th January, 2000. The respondent\nNos.1, 3, 4 and 5 are the mother-in-law, brother-in-law,\nmaternal father-in-law and the father-in-law of the\nappellant respectively. The appellant left her matrimonial\nhome on 25th May, 2001 with her father and brother. In\nthe FIR, the appellant alleged that during her stay in her\nmatrimonial home, she was subjected to harassment and\ncruelty by all the respondents as they were dissatisfied\nwith the articles that the appellant had brought as\nstridhan. The respondents also forced her to bring Rs.5\nlacs more in dowry from her father which she could not\nbring from her parents nor could her parents afford to pay\nsuch a huge amount. The respondents also did not allow\nthe appellant to take back her ornaments and other\narticles, which were gifted to her as stridhan when she left\nher matrimonial home. On 31st July, 2001, the husband,\nnamely, respondent No.2 filed a petition before the Family\nCourt praying for a decree for divorce on the ground of\nmental cruelty. On 31st December, 2001, the appellant\nlodged an FIR No.221 of 2001 against the respondents\nfor the alleged offences under\nSection 498A\nand\nof\nIPC. This FIR was challenged by way of a criminal\nmiscellaneous petition under\nSection 482\nof the Code in\nwhich the respondents prayed for quashing of the said\nFIR. The respondents had also obtained an order\ngranting anticipatory bail from the Sessions Judge,\nJhunjhunu, Rajasthan on 8th February, 2002. While the\npetition under\nSection 482\nof the Code was pending, a\nfinal investigation report was submitted on 13th February,\n2004 in the High Court. The High Court by the impugned\norder had quashed the FIR No.221 of 2001 on the basis\nof the report of the Investigating Officer submitted before\nit and concluded that no offence under\nSection 498A\nand\nof the IPC was made out by the appellant against the\nrespondents. The High Court also observed that the FIR\nmust be quashed to avoid undue harassment and mental\nagony to the respondents, more so when the divorce\npetition was still pending before the Family Court. It is this\norder of the High Court, quashing the FIR in the exercise\nof its inherent power under\nSection 482\nof the Code,\nwhich is now under challenge before us in this appeal.\n\n5. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties\nand after considering the materials on record and the\ncomplaint filed by the appellant under\nSections 498A\nand\nof the IPC, we are of the view that the High Court had\nexceeded its jurisdiction by quashing the FIR No.221 of\n2001 in the exercise of its inherent powers under\nSection\nof the Code. Before we consider the scope and\npower of the High Court to quash an FIR in the exercise\nof its inherent powers under\nSection 482\nof the Code\neven before the parties are permitted to adduce evidence\nin respect of the offences alleged to have been made\nunder the aforesaid two sections (namely,\nSections 498A\n\nand\nof IPC), we may keep it on record that two\nquestions merit our determination in the present case: -\n\n(i) whether the High Court while quashing the FIR in the\nexercise of its inherent powers under Section 482 of the\nCode was entitled to go beyond the complaint filed by the\ncomplainant; and (ii) whether the High Court was\nentitled to look into and consider the investigation report\nsubmitted by four officers of the rank of Dy.\n\nSuperintendent of Police for quashing the FIR even\nbefore the same could be filed before the concerned\nMagistrate. Before we do that, we may first consider how\nand when the High Court, in its inherent powers under\n\nSection 482\nof the Code, would be justified in quashing\nan FIR. It is at this stage appropriate to refer\nSection 482\n\nof the Code itself which runs as under:\n\n\u0013482. Saving of inherent powers of High Court \u0016\nNothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit\nor affect the inherent powers of the High Court\nto make such orders as may be necessary to\ngive effect to any order under this Code, or to\nprevent abuse of the process of any Court or\notherwise to secure the ends of justice.\u0014\n\nA bare look at this provision would show that while\nexercising such inherent powers, the High Court must be\nsatisfied that either:-\n\n(i) An order passed under the Code would be\nrendered ineffective; or\n\n(ii) The process of any court would be abused; or\n\n(iii) The ends of justice would not be secured.\n\nIn\nState of West Bengal Vs. Swapan Kumar Guha\n[1982\n[1] SCC 561] Chandrachud, C.J. [as His Lordship then\nwas] had observed that if the FIR did not disclose the\ncommission of a cognizable offence, the court would be\njustified in quashing the investigation on the basis of the\ninformation as laid or received. In the same judgment,\nJustice A.N. Sen [as His Lordship then was] who has\nwritten the main judgment, has laid down the legal\npropositions as follows:\n\n\u0013...the legal position is well-settled. The legal\nposition appears to be that if an offence is\ndisclosed, the Court will not normally interfere\nwith an investigation into the case and will permit\ninvestigation into the offence alleged to be\ncompleted; if, however, the materials do not\ndisclose an offence, no investigation should\nnormally be permitted.... Once an offence is\ndisclosed, an investigation into the offence must\nnecessarily follow in the interests of justice. If,\nhowever, no offence is disclosed, an\ninvestigation cannot be permitted, as any\ninvestigation, in the absence of any offence\nbeing disclosed, will result in unnecessary\nharassment to a party, whose liberty and\nproperty may be put to jeopardy for nothing. The\nliberty and property of any individual are sacred\nand sacrosanct and the court zealously guards\nthem and protects them. An investigation is\ncarried on for the purpose of gathering necessary\nmaterials for establishing and proving an offence\nwhich is disclosed. When an offence is disclosed,\na proper investigation in the interests of justice\nbecomes necessary to collect materials for\nestablishing the offence, and for bringing the\noffender to book. In the absence of a proper\ninvestigation in a case where an offence is\ndisclosed, the offender may succeed in escaping\nfrom the consequences and the offender may go\nunpunished to the detriment of the cause of\njustice and the society at large. Justice requires\nthat a person who commits an offence has to be\nbrought to book and must be punished for the\nsame. If the court interferes with the proper\ninvestigation in a case where an offence has\nbeen disclosed, the offence will go unpunished to\nthe serious detriment of the welfare of the society\nand the cause of justice suffers. It is on the basis\nof this principle that the court normally does not\ninterfere with the investigation of a case where\nan offence has been disclosed\u0005\u0005 Whether an\noffence has been disclosed or not must\nnecessarily depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each particular case.... If on a\nconsideration of the relevant materials, the court\nis satisfied that an offence is disclosed, the court\nwill normally not interfere with the investigation\ninto the offence and will generally allow the\ninvestigation into the offence to be completed for\ncollecting materials for proving the offence\u0014.\n\nIn\nPratibha Rani Vs. Suraj Kumar and Anr.\n[1985] 2 SCC\n370, this Court at page 395 observed as follows:\n\n\u0013 It is well settled by a long course of decisions of\nthis Court that for the purpose of exercising its\npower under\nSection 482\nCr PC to quash a FIR\nor a complaint the High Court would have to\nproceed entirely on the basis of the allegations\nmade in the complaint or the documents\naccompanying the same per se. It has no\njurisdiction to examine the correctness or\notherwise of the allegations\u0014. [emphasis supplied]\n\nIn\nMadhavrao Jiwaji Rao Scindia and Ors. v. Sambhajirao\nChandrojirao Angre and Ors.\n[1988 [1] SCC 692], this\nCourt has reiterated the same principle and laid down that\nwhen a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be\nquashed, the test to be applied by the court is as to\nwhether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima\nfacie establish the offence.\n\nAgain in the case of\nState of Bihar Vs. Murad Ali Khan &\nOrs.\n[1988 [4] SCC 655], Venkatachaliah, C.J. [as His\nLordship then was] has laid down that the jurisdiction\nunder\nSection 482\nof the Code has to be exercised\nsparingly and with circumspection and has observed that\nin exercising that jurisdiction, the High Court should not\nembark upon an inquiry whether the allegations in the\ncomplaint are likely to be established by evidence or not.\n\n6. From the principles\nlaid down in\nthe\nabovementioned decisions, it is clear that the Court is\nentitled to exercise its inherent jurisdiction for quashing a\ncriminal proceeding or an FIR when the allegations made\nin the same do not disclose the commission of an offence\nand that it depends upon the facts and circumstances of\neach particular case.\n\nWe also feel it just and proper to\nrefer to a leading decision of this court reported in\nState of\nHaryana Vs. Bhajan Lal\n[1992 Suppl. {1} SCC 335] in\nwhich this court pointed out certain category of cases by\nway of illustrations wherein the inherent power under\n\nSection 482\nof the Code can be exercised either to\nprevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to\nsecure the ends of justice. The same are as follows :-\n\n(1) Where the allegations made in the first\ninformation report or the complaint, even if they are\ntaken at their face value and accepted in their\nentirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or\nmake out a case against the accused.\n\n(2) Where the allegations in the first information\nreport and other materials, if any, accompanying the\nFIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying\nan investigation by police officers under\nSection\n156(1)\nof the Code except under an order of a\nMagistrate within the purview of\nSection 155(2)\nof\nthe Code.\n\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in\nthe FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in\nsupport of the same do not disclose the commission\nof any offence and make out a case against the\naccused.\n\n(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not\nconstitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a\nnon-cognizable offence, no investigation is\npermitted by a police officer without an order of a\nMagistrate as contemplated under\nSection 155(2)\nof\nthe Code.\n\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or\ncomplaint are so absurd and inherently improbable\non the basis of which no prudent person can ever\nreach a just conclusion that there is sufficient\nground for proceeding against the accused.\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted\nin any of the provisions of the Code or the\nconcerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding\nis instituted) to the institution and continuance of the\nproceedings and/or where there is a specific\nprovision in the Code or the concerned Act,\nproviding efficacious redress for the grievance of\nthe aggrieved party.\n\n(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\nattended with malafide and/or where the proceeding\nis maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for\nwreaking vengeance on the accused and with a\nview to spite him due to private and personal\ngrudge.\n\n7. Keeping the aforesaid principles in mind and\nconsidering the decisions as referred to hereinearlier, let\nus now apply them in the facts of the present case. But\nbefore we do that, it would be apt for us to consider the\nfindings arrived at by the High Court for quashing the FIR\nwhich are as under: -\n\n(i) The complainant-wife left the marital\nhouse with her father and brother on\n25th May, 2001. The Divorce Petition\nwas filed by the husband on the\nground of mental cruelty on 31st July,\n2001. It was only on 31st December,\n2001 that the FIR for offences under\n\nSections 498A\nand\nof IPC was\nlodged by the complainant-wife;\n\n(ii) A registered letter was sent to the\nappellant wife for receiving all her\narticles on 13th August, 2001 which\nwas duly received by the father of\nthe appellant;\n\n(iii) The family court also issued\ndirections to the appellant to receive\nher articles on 2nd February, 2002\nand the same were declined by her;\n\n(iv) In view of the above and also in view\nof the detailed report submitted by\nthe investigating officer, even prima\nfacie no offence under\nSection 498A\n\nand\nIPC is made out against the\nrespondent;\n\n(v) The conduct of the appellant wife\nwas depreciable and there had been\na continuing effort by her of avoiding\nthe proceedings before the Court;\n\n(vi) The appellant wife leveled false\nallegations against the Court itself\napart from adopting all sorts of\nunhealthy tactics by creating\ngimmicks and scenes in the Court;\n\n(vii) Merely because one of the\nrespondents is a judicial officer and\nothers being his family members, it\ndid not preclude them from seeking\njustice from a court of law;\n\n(viii) The High Court is empowered to\nquash the FIR to avoid undue\nharassment and mental agony to the\nrespondents, more so when the\ndivorce petition is still pending\nbefore the Family Court.\n\n8. From a plain reading of the findings arrived at by the\nHigh Court while quashing the FIR, it is apparent that the\nHigh Court had relied on extraneous considerations and\nacted beyond the allegations made in the FIR for\nquashing the same in the exercise of its inherent powers\nunder\nSection 482\nof the Code. We have already noted\nthe illustrations enumerated in Bhajan Lal\u0012s case and from\na careful reading of these illustrations, we are of the view\nthat the allegations emerging from the FIR are not\ncovered by any of the illustrations as noted hereinabove.\nFor example, we may take up one of the findings of the\nHigh Court as noted herein above. The High Court has\ndrawn an adverse inference on account of the FIR being\nlodged on 31st December, 2001 while the appellant was\nforced out of the matrimonial home on 25th May, 2001. In\nour view, in the facts and circumstance of the case, the\nHigh Court was not justified in drawing an adverse\ninference against the appellant- wife for lodging the FIR\non 31st December, 2001 on the ground that she had left\nthe matrimonial home atleast six months before that. This\nis because, in our view, the High Court had failed to\nappreciate that the appellant and her family members\nwere, during this period, making all possible efforts to\nenter into a settlement so that the respondent No.2-\nhusband would take her back to the matrimonial home. If\nany complaint was made during this period, there was\nevery possibility of not entering into any settlement with\nthe respondent No.2-husband. It is pertinent to note that\nthe complaint was filed only when all efforts to return to\nthe matrimonial home had failed and the respondent\nNo.2-husband had filed a divorce petition under\nSection\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. That apart, in our\nview, filing of a divorce petition in a Civil Court cannot be\na ground to quash criminal proceedings under Section\n482 of the Code as it is well settled that criminal and civil\nproceedings are separate and independent and the\npendency of a civil proceeding cannot bring to an end a\ncriminal proceeding even if they arise out of the same set\nof facts. Such being the position, we are, therefore, of the\nview that the High Court while exercising its powers under\nSection 482 of the Code has gone beyond the allegations\nmade in the FIR and has acted in excess of its jurisdiction\nand, therefore, the High Court was not justified in\nquashing the FIR by going beyond the allegations made\nin the FIR or by relying on extraneous considerations.\n\n9. This takes us to the second question which merits\nour determination, namely whether the High Court was\nentitled to consider the investigation report submitted\nbefore it by four officers of the rank of Dy. Superintendent\nof Police even before the same could be filed before the\nconcerned Magistrate. As noted herein earlier, a bare\nperusal of the judgment of the High Court would also\nshow that the High Court had relied on the investigation\nreport in quashing the FIR. Now, the question is whether\nthe High Court while exercising its powers under Section\n482 of the Code was justified in relying on the\ninvestigation report which was neither filed before the\nMagistrate nor a copy of the same supplied to the\nappellant. In our view, the High Court has acted in\nexcess of its jurisdiction by relying on the investigation\nreport and the High Court was also wrong in directing the\nreport to be submitted before it. It is now well settled that\nit is for the investigating agency to submit the report to the\nMagistrate. In this connection, we may refer to sub-\nsection (2) of Section 173 of the Code which runs as\nunder :\n\n\u0013(i) As soon as it is completed the officer in\ncharge of the police station shall forward to a\nMagistrate empowered to take cognizance of\nthe offence on a police report \u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005\u0005(not\nnecessary therefore omitted).\u0014\n\nFrom a bare reading of this provision, it cannot be\ndisputed that after completion of the investigation, the\nofficer-in-charge of the police station shall forward the\nreport not to the High Court where the proceedings under\nSection 482 of the Code is pending but to a Magistrate\nempowered to take cognizance of the offence on such\npolice report. Therefore, the High Court had acted beyond\nits power to direct the investigating agency to file the said\nreport before it in the exercise of power under Section\n482 of the Code. The procedure for submitting an\ninvestigation report has been considered by this Court in\nthe case of\nM.C. Abraham and Anr. Vs. State of\nMaharashtra\n[ 2003] 2 SCC 649.\n\nWhile considering the\nlaw on the question as to when the report of the\ninvestigating agency shall be submitted before the\nMagistrate where the case is pending, an observation\nmade in the case of\nAbhinandan Jha Vs. Dinesh Mishra\n\n[AIR 1968 SC117] was quoted with approval by\nB.P.Singh, J. in M.C. Abraham\u0012s case (supra) with which\nwe are also in full agreement and which is as follows:\n\n\u0013 Then the question is, what is the position,\nwhen the Magistrate is dealing with a report\nsubmitted by the police, under Section 173, that\nno case is made out for sending up an accused\nfor trial, which report, as we have already\nindicated, is called, in the area in question, as a\nfinal report\u0012? Even in those cases, if the\nMagistrate agrees with the said report, he may\naccept the final report and close the proceedings.\nBut there may be instances when the Magistrate\nmay take the view, on a consideration of the final\nreport, that the opinion formed by the police is\nnot based on a full and complete investigation, in\nwhich case, in our opinion, the Magistrate will\nhave ample jurisdiction to give directions to the\npolice, under Section 156(3), to make a further\ninvestigation. That is, if the Magistrate feels, after\nconsidering the final report, that the investigation\nis unsatisfactory, or incomplete, or that there is\nscope for further investigation, it will be open to\nthe Magistrate to decline to accept the final\nreport and direct the police to make further\ninvestigation under Section 156(3). The police,\nafter such further investigation, may submit a\ncharge-sheet, or, again submit a final report,\ndepending upon the further investigation made\nby them. If ultimately, the Magistrate forms the\nopinion that the facts, set out in the final report,\nconstitute an offence, he can take cognizance of\nthe offence, under Section 190(1)(b),\nnotwithstanding the contrary opinion of the\npolice, expressed in the final report.\n\nThe function of the Magistracy and the police,\nare entirely different, and though, in the\ncircumstances mentioned earlier, the Magistrate\nmay or may not accept the report, and take\nsuitable action, according to law, he cannot\ncertainly infringe (sic impinge) upon the\njurisdiction of the police, by compelling them to\nchange their opinion, so as to accord with his\nview.\n\nTherefore, to conclude, there is no power,\nexpressly or impliedly conferred under the Code,\non a Magistrate to call upon the police to submit\na charge-sheet, when they have sent a report\nunder Section 169 of the Code, that there is no\ncase made out for sending up an accused for\ntrial.\u0014\n\nThis court in M.C. Abraham\u0012s case (supra) observed in\npara 17 as under:\n\n\u0013The principle, therefore, is well settled that it is\nfor the investigating agency to submit a report to\nthe Magistrate after full and complete\ninvestigation. The investigating agency may\nsubmit a report finding the allegations\nsubstantiated. It is also open to the investigating\nagency to submit a report finding no material to\nsupport the allegations made in the first\ninformation report. It is open to the Magistrate\nconcerned to accept the report or to order further\nenquiry. But what is clear is that the Magistrate\ncannot direct the investigating agency to submit\na report that is in accord with his views. Even in a\ncase where a report is submitted by the\ninvestigating agency finding that no case is made\nout for prosecution, it is open to the Magistrate to\ndisagree with the report and to take cognizance,\nbut what he cannot do is to direct the\ninvestigating agency to submit a report to the\neffect that the allegations have been supported\nby the material collected during the course of\ninvestigation.\u0014\n\nIn our view, applying the principles\nlaid down in\nthe case\nof\nAbhinandan Jha\n(supra) and\nM.C.Abrahim\n(supra) as\nindicated herein above, using the report of the\ninvestigating agency for quashing the FIR or a criminal\nproceeding cannot be sustained. It was impermissible for\nthe High Court to entertain the report of the investigating\nagency before the same could be forwarded and filed\nbefore the concerned Magistrate in compliance with\nSection 173(2) of the Code.\n\nIn\nUnion of India vs. Prakash\nP.Hinduja & Anr.\n[(2003) 6 SCC 195], this Court in para\n20 observed as follows :\n\n\u0013Thus the legal position is absolutely clear and\nalso settled by judicial authorities that the court\nwould not interfere with the investigation or\nduring the course of investigation which would\nmean from the time of the lodging of the First\nInformation Report till the submission of the\nreport by the officer-in-charge of the police\nstation in court under Section 173 (2) Code, this\nfield being exclusively reserved for the\ninvestigating agency.\u0014\n\nTherefore, in view of our discussions made herein\nabove, while exercising power under Section 482 of the\nCode, it is not open to the High Court to rely on the report\nof the investigating agency nor can it direct the report to\nbe submitted before it as the law is very clear that the\nreport of the investigating agency may be accepted by the\nMagistrate or the Magistrate may reject the same on\nconsideration of the material on record. Such being the\nposition, the report of the investigating agency cannot be\nrelied on by the High Court while exercising powers under\nSection 482 of the Code. Accordingly, we are of the view\nthat the High Court has erred in quashing the FIR on\nconsideration of the investigation report submitted before\nit even before the same could be submitted before the\nMagistrate. For the reasons aforesaid, we are inclined to\ninterfere with the order of the High Court and hold that the\nHigh Court in quashing the FIR in the exercise of its\ninherent powers under Section 482 of the Code by relying\non the investigation report and the findings made therein\nhas acted beyond its jurisdiction. For the purpose of\nfinding out the commission of a cognizable offence, the\nHigh Court was only required to look into the allegations\nmade in the complaint or the FIR and to conclude whether\na prima facie offence had been made out by the\ncomplainant in the FIR or the complaint or not.\n\n10. Before parting with this judgment, we may also\nremind ourselves that the power under Section 482 of the\nCode has to be exercised sparingly and in the rarest of\nrare cases. In our view, the present case did not warrant\nsuch exercise by the High Court. For the reasons\naforesaid, we are unable to sustain the order of the High\nCourt and the impugned order is accordingly set aside.\n\nThe appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above. The\nlearned Magistrate is directed to proceed with the case in\naccordance with law. It is expected that the Magistrate\nshall dispose of the criminal proceedings as expeditiously\nas possible preferably within six months from the date of\ncommunication of this judgment.",

BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED  BEFORE US BY THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES, IT IS NECESSARY AT THIS STAGE TO STATE THE FACTS GIVING RISE TO THE FILING OF THIS APPEAL. ACCORDINGLY, THE FACTS IN A NUTSHELL ARE STATED BELOW :  4. THE APPELLANT HAD ENTERED INTO WEDLOCK WITH THE RESPONDENT NO.2 ON 25TH JANUARY, 2000. THE RESPONDENT NOS.1, 3, 4 AND 5 ARE THE MOTHER-IN-LAW, BROTHER-IN-LAW, MATERNAL FATHER-IN-LAW AND THE FATHER-IN-LAW OF THE APPELLANT RESPECTIVELY. THE APPELLANT LEFT HER MATRIMONIAL HOME ON 25TH MAY, 2001 WITH HER FATHER AND BROTHER. IN THE FIR, THE APPELLANT ALLEGED THAT DURING HER STAY IN HER MATRIMONIAL HOME, SHE WAS SUBJECTED TO HARASSMENT AND CRUELTY BY ALL THE RESPONDENTS AS THEY WERE DISSATISFIED WITH THE ARTICLES THAT THE APPELLANT HAD BROUGHT AS STRIDHAN. THE RESPONDENTS ALSO FORCED HER TO BRING RS.5 LACS MORE IN DOWRY FROM HER FATHER WHICH SHE COULD NOT BRING FROM HER PARENTS NOR COULD HER PARENTS AFFORD TO PAY SUCH A HUGE AMOUNT. THE RESPONDENTS ALSO DID NOT ALLOW THE APPELLANT TO TAKE BACK HER ORNAMENTS AND OTHER ARTICLES, WHICH WERE GIFTED TO HER AS STRIDHAN WHEN SHE LEFT HER MATRIMONIAL HOME. ON 31ST JULY, 2001, THE HUSBAND, NAMELY, RESPONDENT NO.2 FILED A PETITION BEFORE THE FAMILY COURT PRAYING FOR A DECREE FOR DIVORCE ON THE GROUND OF MENTAL CRUELTY. ON 31ST DECEMBER, 2001, THE APPELLANT LODGED AN FIR NO.221 OF 2001 AGAINST THE RESPONDENTS FOR THE ALLEGED OFFENCES UNDER SECTION 498A AND OF IPC.
