Since an identical issue and common question of facts are\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 13 of 53\n\ninvolved in bunch of these writ petitions, they are heard\n\nanalogously and are being decided by this common order.\n\nBrief facts of WPS No. 5422 of 2023 & WPS No. 9062 of 2023\n\nare:-\n\n2. The instant writ petitions have been preferred by the petitioners\n\nagainst legality, validity and propriety of the order dated\n\n26.07.2023 (Annexure P/1) passed by respondent No. 2\n\nwhereby the long-standing seniority of the petitioners has been\n\ndisturbed without any cogent reason and accordingly seniority\n\nlist prevailing since 2009-2020 has been modified. The\n\npetitioners have also prayed that seniority list which was in\n\nexistence from 2010-2020 shall be restored.\n\n3. The brief facts as reflected from records are that the petitioners\n\nwere initially appointed on the post of Sub-Engineer in the Public\n\nWorks Department and they were promoted on the post of\n\nAssistant Engineer as per departmental promotion committee\n\nconvened on 24.07.2008 but promotion orders were not issued,\n\nin the meanwhile the private respondents were appointed on\n\n02.08.2008 on the post of Assistant Engineer (Civil). The\n\npetitioners were granted seniority over the private respondents\n\nvide order dated 31.07.2008. The seniority granted to the\n\npetitioners was continued but all of a sudden the impugned order\n\ndated 26.07.2023 (Annexure P/1) has been passed disturbing\n\nthe long-standing seniority granted to the petitioner. This order is\n\nbeing assailed by the petitioners.\n\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 14 of 53\n\nBrief facts of WPS No. 1441 of 2020, WPS No. 4895 of 2020 &\n\nWPS No. 4524 of 2020 are:-\n\n4. The instant petitions have been preferred by the petitioners\n\nagainst inaction on the part of the respondents in not considering\n\nthe degree holder Assistant Engineer for promotion on the post\n\nof Executive Engineer as the respondent State is only\n\nconsidering for promotion on the post of Executive Engineer to\n\nthose candidates who are promoted from the post of Sub-\n\nEngineer/Overseers. The contention of the petitioners in brief is\n\nthat the petitioners are degree holder Assistant Engineer\n\nappointed on 02.08.2008 (Annexure P/1) and as per Rule 13 &\n\n14 as well as Schedule-IV of Chhattisgarh Public Works\n\nEngineering (Gazetted) Service Rules, 1969 (for short \"the\n\nRules, 1969\"), 92% posts are filled up from direct recruitment\n\nAssistant Engineer and remaining 8% have to be filled up by\n\nAssistant Engineers who have been promoted from the post of\n\nSub-Engineers/Overseers and would submit that in the set up of\n\ndepartment, 76 posts of Executive Engineer is sanctioned and\n\n41 posts have already been filled up and out of 41 posts, 19\n\nposts have been occupied by Assistant Engineers directly\n\nrecruited and 22 posts have been occupied by the persons who\n\nare promoted from the post of Sub-Engineers/Overseers and 25\n\nposts are lying vacant still the case of the petitioners for\n\npromotion is not being considered and thus, on the above factual\n\nfoundation, they have prayed for following reliefs:-\n\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 15 of 53\n\n(1) To issue an appropriate writ or order and direct the\nrespondents to consider the case of the petitioners for\npromotion to the post of Executive Engineer Class I in\nterms of 'Recruitment Rules of 1969'.\n\n(2) To issue an appropriate writ or order and direct the\nrespondents to fill up the vacant post of Executive engineer\nClass I in Public Works Department in terms of\n'Recruitment Rules of 1969'.\n\n(3) To issue an appropriate writ or order and hold that the\naction of respondents of giving charge to the promotee\nAssistant Engineers is contrary to the prescriptions and\nbad in law.\n\nIn WPS No. 4985/2020, the petitioners have prayed for\n\nquashing of the decision taken by the committee vide Annexure\n\nP/10 wherein the direct recruited Assistant Engineers in the year\n\n2008 have moved the representation and respondent authority\n\nhas rejected the representation of the petitioners for correction in\n\nthe seniority list and prayer for promotion. The decision of the\n\nauthority rejecting the representation of the petitioner is per se\n\nillegal and bad as Rule 12 of the Chhattisgarh Civil Services\n\n(General Condition of Service) Rules, 1961 (for short \"the Rules,\n\n1961\") specifically provides that the seniority of a direct recruited\n\ngovernment servant appointed on probation shall be counted\n\nduring his probation from the date of his appointment, Rule 12\n\n(a)(ii) of the Rules, 1961 is applicable in a case where the\n\nprobation has been extended by the appointing authority\n\nadmittedly in the case of the petitioners the probation was never\n\nextended thus the conclusion drawn by the said committee is per\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 16 of 53\n\nse illegal and contrary to the provisions contained in the Rules,\n\n1961. It has also been contended that respondents No. 1 & 2 are\n\nproceeding with the DPC on the basis of gradation list of the year\n\n2019-20 which was issued on 28.10.2020 without giving any\n\nopportunity to submit their objection, is in violation of principle of\n\nnatural justice and would pray for quashing of the decision\n\n(Annexure P/10) taken by the committee and also prayed for\n\npromotion on the post of Assistant Engineers strictly in\n\naccordance with the Rules, 1961.\n\nIn WPS No. 4524/2020 the petitioners have prayed for quashing\n\nof the decision taken by the committee by which their\n\nrepresentation has been rejected. The petitioners have reiterated\n\nthe same factual matrix which has already been reiterated in\n\nWPS No. 1441 of 2020, WPS No. 4895 of 2020.\n\nBrief facts of WPS No. 8716 of 2023 are:-\n\n5. Apart from the facts mentioned in aforesaid writ petitions, it has\n\nalso been contended in the writ petition that in the year 2008,\n\n257 sanctioned posts of Assistant Engineers was sanctioned in\n\nthe department and only 47 officers were posted as such 210\n\nposts are lying vacant and 340 additional posts were anticipated\n\nto become vacant. Accordingly, a proposal for making promotion\n\nto the post of Assistant Engineer (Civil) for the year 2005-07 was\n\nalready sent to the Chhattisgarh Public Service Commission who\n\nconvened the DPC on 24.07.2008 and all the Sub-Engineers\n\nwere recommended to be promoted by the CGPSC on\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 17 of 53\n\n30.07.2008 and their promotion orders were issued on\n\n19.09.2008. It has also been contended that some of the private\n\nrespondents have filed WPS No. 3208/2020 wherein this Court\n\nwhile passing the order on 18.08.2020 and has observed in\n\nparagraph 5 that since the petitioners have already preferred\n\nrepresentation and the State Government has constituted a\n\ncommittee on 10.07.2020, it is directed that the said committee\n\nshall consider the representation and pass a detailed order. In\n\nview of the above factual matrix, the petitioner has also prayed\n\nfor same relief for quashing of the order dated 26.07.2023\n\n(Annexure P/1).\n\n6. Some of the the intervenors are in support of the petitioners and\n\nsome of the intervenors are against the petitioners. Learned\n\ncounsel for the interveners who supports the case of the\n\npetitioners would submit that the intervenors are posted as\n\nAssistant Engineer were promoted to the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer vide order dated 19.09.2008. The Seniority of the\n\nintervenor along with other promoted Assistant Engineers has\n\nbeen decided as per Rule 12 of the Rules, 1961. The private\n\nrespondents have objected the seniority granted to the\n\nintervenor and other promoted assistant engineer although they\n\nhave been promoted under a separate quota. As such, any order\n\npassed by this Court in these petitions, will have adverse affect\n\nin the service carrier of the intervenor, therefore, they would pray\n\nfor allowing the intervention applications. Learned counsel for\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 18 of 53\n\nthe intervenors would submit that the impugned order dated\n\n26.07.2023 (Annexure P/1) is bad in law as long-standing\n\nseniority has been adversely affected by the impugned order,\n\nthus, they would pray for quashing of the impugned order dated\n\n26.07.2023 (Annexure P/1).\n\n7. Considering the submission, the intervention applications filed by\n\nthe intervenors are allowed as their interest are being adversely\n\naffected in ongoing litigation between the parties. Accordingly,\n\nthe intervenors are allowed to make their submissions.\n\nReturn of the State:-\n\n8. In WPS No. 5422 of 2023, WPS No. 9062 of 2023, WPS No.\n\n8716 of 2023 the State has filed their return mainly contending\n\nthat the petitioners were earlier appointed as Sub-Engineers and\n\nthen promoted to the post of Assistant Engineer as per the DPC\n\nconvened on 24.07.2008 for 188 posts but the promotion orders\n\nwere issued on 19.09.2008 & 31.07.2008. As such, their date of\n\npromotion will be 19.09.2008 & 31.07.2008. It has also been\n\ncontended that the petitioners whose names were not found\n\nplace in the list of 31.07.2008, cannot claim seniority from\n\n31.07.2008 and candidature of the petitioners were found\n\neligible and kept in the list of 30 posts of anticipated candidates\n\nand in the meantime, on 19.09.2008, 26 posts of Assistant\n\nEngineer got vacant due to the promotion of Assistant Engineer\n\nto Executive Engineer, therefore, to fulfill these 26 posts, the\n\ncandidature from the list of anticipated candidates who were\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 19 of 53\n\nfound eligible in the DPC convened on 24.07.2008, was\n\nconsidered and new list of promotion was published on\n\n19.09.2008 giving the promotion to the petitioners, from Sub-\n\nEngineers to Assistant Engineer. Thus, it is quite vivid that the\n\npetitioners were promoted on 19.09.2008 and they borne in the\n\ncadre of the Assistant Engineer w.e.f. 19.09.2008 and not from\n\n31.07.2008, therefore, as per Rule 12(1)(e) of the Rules, 1961,\n\nthe seniority of the petitioners were to be counted from\n\n19.09.2008 not from 31.07.2008. The list of the candidates given\n\npromotion on 31.07.2008 along with the list of the candidates\n\nwhose names were later on considered during circulation w.e.f.\n\n31.07.2008 is also filed with the return as Annexure R/3 & R/4. It\n\nis also pertinent to mention here that all the 158 vacant posts\n\nwere fulfilled on 31.07.2008 itself and during the DPC Convened\n\non 24.07.2008, the candidatures of the petitioners were found\n\neligible and kept in the list of 30 posts of anticipated candidates.\n\n9. It has also been contended that writ petition bearing WP(S) No.\n\n3208 of 2020 was filed before this Court and disposed off on\n\n18.08.2020, wherein it has been held as under:-\n\n\"5. Reading of the order dated 10.07.2020 (Annexure P-2)\nwould show that the State Government has already formed\na Committee to decide the seniority amongst the Assistant\nEngineer (Civil) and invited for objection and\nrepresentation. Since it appears that the representation\nhas already been preferred by the petitioners to the\nSecretary, Public Works Department, the Committee shall\nconsider the representation of the petitioners and pass a\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 20 of 53\n\ndetail order. It is further made clear, at this stage, the Court\nhas not observed any right of the intervener or in respect of\nthe merit of this case.\"\n\n10. In pursuance of the order passed by this Court in WPS No. 3208\n\nof 2020, a committee was constituted by the State Government\n\nfor looking towards the objections raised by various promotees\n\nas well as direct recruitees in case of seniority and the\n\nCommittee has submitted its report to the Secretary, Public Work\n\nDepartment, State of Chhattisgarh, on 13.10.2020 wherein it\n\nwas recommended that the inter-se seniority between the direct\n\nrecruitment as well as promotees, shall be decided on the basis\n\nof Rule 12(1)(e) of the Rules, 1961. It has been further\n\ncontended that the he Secretary, General Administration\n\nDepartment on 27.03.2021 has given an opinion on 21.05.2021\n\nfor determining the seniority as per Rule 12(1)(c) of the Rules,\n\n1961.\n\n11. It has been further contended that another writ petition bearing\n\nWPS No. 1607 of 2023 was filed by the petitioner-Umendra\n\nVerma (who was promoted as Assistant Engineer from Sub-\n\nEngineer on 31.07.2008, serial No. 109), wherein he has\n\nchallenged non-consideration of his candidature for promotion\n\non the post of Executive Engineer, which was disposed off by\n\nthis Hon'ble Court on 02.03.2023, directing the respondent\n\nauthorities to convene the DPC within four months and take\n\nnecessary actions in accordance with law, therefore, to comply\n\nthe order of the Hon'ble Court, the necessity arose to prepare\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 21 of 53\n\nthe gradation list, and the same was done on the basis of the\n\nopinion of the General Administration Department.\n\n12. It has been further contended that the seniority list published\n\nfrom 01.04.2009 to 01.04.2020 was revised on the\n\nrecommendation of the General Administration Department of\n\nState of Chhattisgarh and the revised list was prepared relying\n\nupon Rule 12 (1)(e) of the Rules, 1961. As a result of which,\n\npetitioners were placed below the private respondents. It has\n\nbeen further contended that the petitioners are junior to the\n\nprivate respondents as evident from their date of appointment\n\nmentioned in Annexure R/1.\n\n13. It has been further contended that various representations were\n\nmade by the private respondents before the Government\n\nauthorities for revising the seniority list as the same seniority list\n\nwas not in accordance with Rule 12(1) (e) of the Rules, 1961,\n\nwhich has been considered by the State vide order dated\n\n26.07.2023 (Annexure P/1) modifying the seniority of Assistant\n\nEngineers of the department.\n\n14. The respondents/ State has also enclosed the note-sheet of the\n\nfile which has decided to apply Rule 12 (1)(e) of the Rules, 1961\n\nfor fixing the inter se seniority between direct recruited or\n\npromoted Assistant Engineers. It has been further contended\n\nthat while considering the issue of promotion and dispute\n\npertains to the seniority. the State Government has taken the\n\nfinal decision on 26.07.2023 and after considering all the facts\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 22 of 53\n\nand circumstances and the Rules, 1961 have decided that the\n\nrespondents who were appointed on 02.08.2008 will be placed\n\nabove the Assistant (Civil) Engineers who were promoted on\n\n19.09.2008 against the vacancies occurred on 19.09.2008. It\n\nhas been further contended that from bare perusal of the\n\naforesaid chronological dates and events, it is quite vivid that\n\nthe dispute pertains to only seniority amongst the Assistant\n\nEngineers (Civil) directly appointed on 02.08.2008 and Assistant\n\nEngineers (Civil) was promoted on 19.09.2008. It is also clear\n\nthat, the petitioner was considered for promotion for the future\n\nvacancies (if no vacancy occurred, the petitioners have no right\n\nto claim promotion). Admittedly the future vacancies occurred on\n\n19.09.2008 itself and therefore, the petitioner was promoted\n\nagainst the said vacant post.\n\n15. In WPS No. 1441/2020, the State has further contended that the\n\ninstant petition has been preferred jointly by the petitioners\n\nseeking promotion to the higher post. According to the\n\npetitioners, they were appointed on the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer (Civil) in Public Works Department and their services\n\nare governed by the Recruitment Rules of 1969 under which\n\nRule 14 deals with appointment by promotion and Schedule IV\n\nprescribes that for promotion to the post of Executive Engineer\n\nClass I, a candidate must have an experience of 6 years. It has\n\nalso been contended that a meeting was convened on\n\n18.07.2011 by the Chhattisgarh Public Service Commission,\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 23 of 53\n\nRaipur regarding promotion to the post of Executive Engineer\n\n(Civil) from the post of Assistant Engineer for the promotion year\n\n2010. It has been further contended that one Pradeep Kumar\n\nJanvade had preferred WPS No 1679/2012 before the Hon'ble\n\nHigh Court against the promotion order dated 27.06.2011, which\n\nwas passed after the review DPC for promotion to the post of\n\nExecutive Engineer from the post of Assistant Engineer (Civil) for\n\nthe promotion year 1991. In the aforesaid petition, the Hon'ble\n\nCourt has passed stay order on 03.10.2013. Thereafter, in\n\npursuance of the order dated 03.10.2013, the seniority list for the\n\npost of Executive Engineer and higher posts could not be issued\n\nnor the proceeding for promotion to the post of Executive\n\nEngineer, Superintending Engineer, Chief Engineer and\n\nEngineer-in-Chief has been initiated. Subsequently, this Court\n\nhas vacated the order of stay granted on 03.10.2013 as modified\n\non 12.08.2014 and granted liberty to the State of Chhattisgarh to\n\nre-draw the seniority if so advised independent of decision of this\n\nCourt in Rajeev Sharma's case (supra) in accordance with law.\n\nHowever. any promotion to any member of the cadre shall be\n\nsubject to the final decision of the writ petition. It has been\n\nfurther contended that the department initiated proceeding\n\nregarding grant of promotion to the post of Superintending\n\nEngineer and Executive Engineer, which is under process. After\n\nconsidering the records and relevant aspects, it is clear if the\n\npetitioners found fit for promotion to the higher post, the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 24 of 53\n\npromotion would be granted in accordance with law. It has been\n\nfurther contended that the petitioners cannot claim promotion on\n\nthe higher post as a matter of right.\n\n16. In WPS No. 4895 of 2020 & WPS No. 4524 of 2020, the State\n\nhas filed their return mainly contending that a detailed\n\nrepresentation was made by many of the direct recruitees to\n\ncorrect the aforesaid anomaly. It has been further contended that\n\nthat the present petition itself is not maintainable and liable to be\n\ndismissed on the ground of delay and latches. It is settled\n\nposition of law that the dispute with respect to the seniority or\n\npromotion is to be raised at the earliest point of time and not\n\nbelatedly. As in the instant case the seniority of the Assistant\n\nEngineers have already been finalized in the year 2011 and the\n\ngradation list dated 29.03.2011. Subsequently finding the\n\ndiscrepancy in the promotion of Sub Engineers to the post of\n\nAssistant Engineers, wherein certain seniors have been left from\n\nbeing promoted and juniors have got promotion contrary to law,\n\na Review D.P.C. was convened on 05.06.2010 and the order\n\ndated 31/07/2008 was amended giving seniority to all the Sub\n\nEngineers who got promoted to the post of Assistant Engineers\n\nfrom 31/07/2008 itself and fresh orders were issued on\n\n28/08/2010 promoting and demoting the officers in accordance\n\nwith law.\n\n17. It has been further contended that after conducting review DPC,\n\nthe gradation list was prepared and published as per Rules of\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 25 of 53\n\n1961 maintaining the seniority of promoted Assistant Engineers\n\nand directly appointed Assistant Engineer. The petitioners\n\nneither have challenged the order of review DPC and the\n\ndecision taken thereupon, nor the gradation list issued in the\n\nyear 2011 at the relevant point of time which became final. It is\n\nsettled position of law that mere filing of representation with\n\nrespect to stale claim does not give any fresh cause of action\n\nnor the delay and laches are wiped out. Hon'ble the Supreme\n\nCourt in case of\nUnion of India Vs. C. Girija & others\nreported\n\nin (2019) 15 SCC 633 and would pray for dismissal of the writ\n\npetitions.\n\n18. It has been further contended that the petitioners are not\n\ngoverned presently as per Rules 1969, since in the year 2015\n\nnew Rules have already been notified namely Chhattisgarh\n\nPublic Works Engineering (Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules\n\n2015 (for short \"the Rules, 2015\") and as such the petitioners\n\nare governed by the same. It has been further contended that\n\nneither review DPC was ever challenged nor the decision dated\n\n28/08/2010 was put to challenge by the petitioners at any point\n\nof time which became final. The posts were lying vacant and the\n\nDPC was duly convened and recommended for promotion to all\n\nthe Sub Engineers to the post of Assistant Engineers and mainly\n\nfor the reason, few orders of promotion were issued subsequent\n\nto the appointment of the petitioners does not entitle them to\n\nclaim benefit over and above, the promotee Assistant Engineers\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 26 of 53\n\nwhose candidature was under consideration for promotion of the\n\nyear 2005, 2006 & 2007. It is further respectfully submitted that\n\nthe entire action on the part of the answering respondents is\n\naccordance with law and no benefit was given to any person\n\nillegally and the seniority list / gradation list which was published\n\nis in accordance with law. The promotee Assistant Engineers\n\nwere entitled to the seniority as on 31.07.2008, since on that\n\ndate already candidature of all the Sub Engineers was duly\n\nconsidered and recommended in accordance with law which\n\nwas duly considered at the time of Review DPC and accordingly\n\nthe seniority list was published in the year 2011 wherein the\n\npetitioners were kept below the Assistant Engineers who were\n\npromoted.\n\n19. It has been further contended that all the facts have been duly\n\nconsidered by the Committee and by a detailed speaking order\n\ntheir representations were rejected which cannot be faulted with\n\nthe seniority as determined by the Committee, after considering\n\nRule 12 of the Rules, 1961. The petitioners themselves are not\n\nentitled for any relief in view of the settled position of law as held\n\nby various High Courts and the Hon'ble Supreme Court, holding\n\nthat the dispute regarding seniority or promotion cannot be\n\nraised at a belated stage as the same is having cascading effect\n\nand the courts cannot interfere to unsettle, the settled position\n\nand the petitioners should have to be vigilant in order to make\n\nany challenge to the seniority. It has been further contended that\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 27 of 53\n\nthe order impugned does not suffer from any infirmity and\n\nlegality, petitioners are not entitled for any relief as prayed for\n\nand the petition filed by the petitioners being devoid of merits\n\nwithout substance is liable to be dismissed.\n\n20. The private respondents have also filed their return mainly\n\ncontending that on 24.07.2008 a Departmental Promotion\n\nCommittee (DPC) was held for grant of promotion on the post of\n\nassistant engineers from the feeder cadre of sub engineers for\n\n188 vacant posts and 135 Sub Engineers were promoted vide\n\norder dated 31.07.2008 and some posts were kept under\n\ncirculation. It has been further contended that after the issuance\n\nof promotion order for 135 Sub-Engineers 30 anticipated\n\nvacancies of Assistant Engineers were left out which were to be\n\nfilled by promotion of Sub Engineers. These anticipated\n\nvacancies have arisen due to promotion of Assistant Engineer\n\non the post of Executive Engineer. The petitioners were granted\n\npromotion against these 30 anticipated vacancies vide order\n\ndated 19.09.2008 only when the anticipated vacancies became\n\nactual available. They would further submit that the submission\n\nmade by the petitioners that all the 155 Sub Engineers were\n\npromoted to the post of Assistant Engineer and postings were\n\ngiven to them on 31.07.2008, is incorrect submission of facts as\n\nfirst promotion order was issued on 31.07.2008 in which 135\n\nSub-Engineers were granted promotion on the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer and second promotion order was issued on 19.09.2008\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 28 of 53\n\nin which petitioners were granted promotion. It has been further\n\ncontened that it is settled principle of law that an employee takes\n\nbirth in the cadre either on the date of appointment or from the\n\ndate of its promotion. It is immaterial that when the DPC was\n\nheld, whether some of the recommended candidates were\n\npromoted earlier, therefore, the submission made by the\n\npetitioners that all 155 Sub-Engineers were posted vide order\n\ndated 31.07.2008, is illegal and bad in law as on date of DPC.\n\n21. It has been further contended that the anticipated vacancies\n\nwere not even actual vacancies. It has been further submitted\n\nthat to conduct direct recruitment on the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer (Civil), an advertisement was issued on 28.12.2006.\n\nThe private respondents were participated in the said\n\nrecruitment process and being successful in the selection\n\nprocess, appointments were granted against 42 posts of\n\nAssistant Engineer (direct recruitment quota) to them vide order\n\ndated 02.08.2008. They would further submit that the petitioners\n\nwere placed above the private respondents in seniority list\n\nwrongfully for the reason that respondent No. 26 along with\n\nother private respondents were appointed in the cadre of\n\nAssistant Engineer before the petitioners. They would further\n\nsubmit that a bare perusal of the order dated 18.08.2020 passed\n\nby this Hon'ble Court in WPS No. 3208 of 2020 reflects that no\n\nadjudication on merits have been done by this Court and only a\n\ndirection was issued for deciding the claim of the private\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 29 of 53\n\nrespondents herein by constituting a Committee vide the order\n\ndated 10.07.2020.\n\n22. It has been further contended that the Committee has rejected\n\nthe claim of the direct recruit vide recommendation dated\n\n13.10.2020 and the said recommendation was never culminated\n\nin any final order. It has been further contended that the claim of\n\nthe petitioners that they were having a long-standing seniority as\n\nthey were placed above the direct recruits from 2009 till the\n\nissuance of the impugned order is a baseless contention for the\n\nreason that seniority can only be granted in accordance with the\n\nrules. It has been further contended that Rule 12 (1) (e) of the\n\nRules, 1961 clearly provides that 'the relative seniority between\n\ndirect recruitees and promotees shall be determined according\n\nto the date of issuance of appointment/promotion order. These\n\nrules are binding for fixing seniority and the petitioners were\n\nborne in the cadre of Assistant Engineer after the private\n\nrespondents. It has been further contended that when the\n\nauthorities realized their mistake, they corrected the same by\n\nway of issuing impugned order dated 26.07.2023 which is under\n\nchallenge by the petitioners.\n\n23. It has been further contended that as per Rule 12(1)(b) of the\n\nRules, 1961, the seniority of promotees will be determined in the\n\norder in which they were recommended for such promotion and\n\nRule 12(1)(e) of the Rules, 1961 clearly provides that, relative\n\nseniority amongst direct recruitees and promotees shall be\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 30 of 53\n\ndetermined according to the date of issue of appointment/\n\npromotion order. Admittedly, in the instant case, the appointment\n\norders of private respondents were issued on 02.08.2008 and\n\nthey have joined the posts and thereafter on 19.09.2008 the\n\npromotion orders of the petitioners were issued and therefore,\n\nthe decision dated 26.07.2023 is in accordance with Rule 12(1)\n\n(e) of the Rules, 1961. It has been further contended that it is\n\ntotally wrong on the part of the petitioners to contend that the\n\ngradation list of the Assistant Engineers for the year 2009 issued\n\non 29.03.2011 wherein they were placed above the private\n\nrespondents and the same was followed upto 2023 and thus has\n\nattained finality.\n\nSubmissions made by the counsel for the petitioners\n\n24. Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that it is\n\nessential that any one who feels aggrieved by the seniority\n\nassigned to him, should approach the Court as early as possible\n\nas otherwise in addition to the creation of a sense of insecurity in\n\nthe minds of the Government servants there would also be\n\nadministrative complications and difficulties. He would further\n\nsubmit that in the instant case, the private respondents have\n\napproached the concerned authorities and Hon'ble Court after a\n\nspan of about 11-12 years and such belated claim of the private\n\nrespondents could not be allowed to entertain as being barred\n\nby delay and laches and long-standing seniority of the\n\npetitioners could not be disturbed after such a long span of time.\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 31 of 53\n\nHe would further submit that the respondents No. 37 and 38\n\nthough they were also initially appointed on the post of Sub-\n\nEngineer and in the Year 2011 they were promoted as Assistant\n\nEngineer. So far as the petitioners are concerned they were\n\npromoted in the Year 2009 meaning thereby the respondents\n\nNo. 37 and 38 were found place in cadre of Assistant Engineer\n\nin the Year 2011, a bare perusal of the impugned gradation list\n\nwould show that those who were promoted in the year 2011 are\n\nplaced above to the petitioners in the gradation list of Year 2023.\n\nThe aforesaid facts and circumstance patently made in evident\n\nthat the entire gradation list is being prepared in heist without\n\nany due application of mind and in order to serve the interest of\n\nprivate respondents. Further contention of the petitioners is that\n\nHon'ble the Supreme Court in case of\nK.R. Mudgal and Others\n\nVs. R.P. Singh & Others\nreported in (1986) 4 SCC 531 has held\n\nthat a government servant who is appointed to any post\n\nordinarily should at least after a period of 3 or 4 years of his\n\nappointment be allowed to attend the duties attached to his post\n\npeacefully and without any sense of insecurity. Satisfactory\n\nservice conditions postulate that there should be no sense of\n\nuncertainty amongst the Government servants. On the above\n\nfactual matrix, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of the\n\nimpugned order dated 26.07.2023 (Annexure P/1) passed by\n\nrespondent No. 2.\n\n25. They would further submit that the respondent authorities have\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 32 of 53\n\narbitrarily issued the impugned gradation list without issuing the\n\nprovisional list calling for objections from the petitioners and\n\nother concerned persons which they were obliged to do as per\n\nthe relevant rules. They would further submit that the impugned\n\norder will cause great prejudice to the petitioners as they shall\n\nloose their seniority from the date of direct appointment of\n\nservice and thereafter the promotional avenues will not be\n\navailable to the petitioners. To substantiate their submission,\n\nthey would rely upon the following judgments of the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court in case of\nShiba Shankar Mohapatra & Ors. V.\n\nState of Orissa & Ors.\nreported in (2010) 12 SCC 471, HS\n\nVankani and Others Vs. State of Gujarat and Others reported\n\nin (2010) 4 SCC 301, the Hon'ble Madhya Pradesh in case of\n\nSuresh Singh Bhandari Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh\n\nreported in (2016) 4 MPLJ 180, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\n\ncase of\nState of Uttaranchal Vs. Shiv Charan Singh Bhandari\n\nreported in (2013) 12 SCC 179, in case of\nS. S. Balu Vs. State\n\nof Kerala\nreported in (2009) 2 SCC 479 & in case of\nKeshav\n\nDeo & Anr. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors.\nreported in 1991 (1) SCC\n\n280.\n\nSubmissions of the State and Private respondents\n\n26. Learned counsel of the State as well as the private respondents\n\nwould submit that there is no ambiguity in the decision dated\n\n26.07.2023 or in decision making process and submission made\n\nby the petitioner that the seniority of the petitioners cannot be\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 33 of 53\n\nchallenged or disturbed after near about 12 years (After\n\nappointment of respondents on 02.08.2008 and promotion of the\n\npetitioners on 19.09.2008, the first gradation list was issued on\n\n29.03.2011), is misconception of facts as illegality cannot be\n\nallowed to be continued. It has been further contended that\n\nobjections were invited by the State Government and the direct\n\nrecruitees raised the objection then and there and it was kept\n\nunder consideration, which has been decided finally on\n\n26.07.2023 and would pray for dismissal of the writ petitions.\n\n27. To substantiate these submissions, they would rely upon the\n\njudgment rendered by Hon'ble the Apex Court in case of\nState\n\nof Bihar v. Akhouri Sachindra Nath\nreported in 1991 Supp (1)\n\nSCC 334, Vinodanand Yadav v. State of Bihar reported in\n\n1994 Supp (2) SCC 44 and State of Uttaranchal Vs.

I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the\n\nrecords of DPC held in the year 2008 as well as the records\n\npertaining to the issuance of impugned order dated 26.07.2023.\n\n29. From submission made by learned counsel for the parties\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 34 of 53\n\nincluding intervenors supporting/opposing case of the\n\npetitioners, the points required to be determined by this Court\n\nare:-\n\n\"(1) Whether the petitioners who were considered for\n\npromotion for the cadre post of Assistant Engineers in the\n\ndepartmental promotion committee held on 24.07.2008\n\nagainst 30 anticipated vacancies of Assistant Engineers\n\nwhen there were no cadre post was vacant can claim\n\nseniority from the date of recommendation i.e. 24.07.2008\n\nor from the date when other Sub-Engineers were\n\npromoted vide order dated 31.07.2008 whereas they were\n\npromoted on 19.09.2008 by the State on that day only the\n\npost were vacated due to promotion of 26 Assistant\n\nEngineer (Civil) to Executive Engineer (Civil).\n\n(2) Whether relative seniority between direct recruited\n\nAssistant Engineer and promotee Assistant Engineer shall\n\nbe governed by Rule 12(1)(e) of the Rules, 1961.\n\n(3) Whether the petitioners are entitled to get seniority on the\n\ncount of principle of long-standing of their seniority from\n\n2011 till the impugned order dated 26.07.2023 was\n\npassed by the State.\n\n30. Since the above points emerges for determination by this Court\n\nare inter connected, dependable upon each other, co-relates\n\nwith each other, they are being decided analogously.\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 35 of 53\n\n31. To appreciate the above points, it is expedient for this Court to\n\nextract the record of DPC which was held in the year 2008 for\n\npromotion of Sub-Engineer to the post of Assistant Engineer and\n\nthe Rules known as Chhattisgarh Public Works Engineering\n\n(Gazetted) Service Recruitment Rules, 1969 (for short \"the\n\nRules, 1969\"). Rule 14 of the Rules, 1969 provides conditions for\n\neligibility of promotion. This rule further provides that the\n\ncommittee shall consider the case of the person (whether\n\nofficiating or substantive) in the service mentioned in Column 2\n\nof Schedule IV or any other post or posts declared equivalent\n\nthere to by the Government. The Schedule IV of the said rule\n\nprovides that promotion from the post of Junior Engineer/Sub-\n\nEngineer to promotion on the post of Assistant Engineer Class-II,\n\n8 years service for overseers promotion to the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer, 12 years and graduate Sub-Engineers, 8 years\n\nservice. Accordingly, a DPC was held on 24.07.2008 for\n\npromotion of Sub-Engineer/Draftsman on the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer in which 107 Sub-Engineers which consists of 66\n\ndiploma holder in unreserved category, 24 ST and 17 SC\n\ncategory Sub-Engineer were included. 30 candidates out of\n\nunreserved graduate category, 9 ST and 3 SC graduate Sub-\n\nEngineers were included for promotion. Since the candidates in\n\nthe zone of consideration of this category were not available,\n\ntherefore, 3 candidates of SC category were also included. In\n\nthe draftsman cadre, 7 officers were included from unreserved\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 36 of 53\n\ncategory, 2 candidates from ST and 3 candidates were not\n\nincluded in the zone of consideration.\n\n32. The record of the DPC also reflects that the DPC will consider\n\n25% of anticipated vacancies as per Rule 6(2) of Chhattisgsarh\n\nPublic Services (Promotion) Rules, 2003 (for short \"the Rules,\n\n2003\") of the public servant who have fulfilled the requisite\n\nlength of service. Accordingly, DPC was held on 24.07.2008. The\n\nrecords of DPC reflects that there are 257 posts in the cadre out\n\nof which 125 posts have to be filled up from diploma holder in\n\nunreserved, ST & SC candidates, 51 for graduate engineers and\n\n12 for draftsman. Thus, total 181 posts have to be filled up.\n\n33. Thereafter, after getting approval and proposal for posting, the\n\nfile was sent on 30.07.2008 to the Government and promotion\n\norder of 119 Sub-Engineer/Draftsman on the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer was issued. The committee has kept the names of 23\n\nSub-Engineers in circulation as certain ACRs were not available\n\nat the time of conducting DPC. Thereafter, the petitioners namely\n\nAnuj Sharma, Ashish Kumar Bhattacharya and others Sub-\n\nEngineers were promoted and posted on the post of Assistant\n\nEngineer (Civil) on 19.09.2008. The records of the case would\n\nfurther demonstrate that on 19.09.2008, 24 Assistant Engineers\n\nwere promoted on the post of Executive Engineers, therefore,\n\nthe vacancy was available, accordingly, the candidates of DPC\n\ndated 24.07.2008 who could not be promoted on account of\n\nfilling of the post of Assistant Engineer, the Sub-Engineer were\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 37 of 53\n\npromoted on 19.09.2008 as Assistant Engineer. Thus, it is quite\n\nvivid that the petitioners were not promoted on 24.07.2008 but\n\nthey were found fit for promotion and since the vacancies were\n\nnot available till 19.09.2008, they were not promoted. As soon\n\nas, the vacancies were available, they were promoted. Though\n\nas per Rule 6(2) of the Rules, 2003, the DPC has to conduct for\n\nanticipated vacancies also. Rule 6(2) of the Rules, 2003 is\n\nproduced below:-\n\n\"6. Promotion on the basis of seniority subject to\nfitness.- (2) The names of only such public servant shall\nbe considered for promotion, who have completed the\nprescribed qualifying service in their feeder cadre/part of\nthe service/pay scale of post according to the Recruitment\nRules. It is, however, not necessary to consider all the\nnames of public servants who have completed the\nprescribed minimum length of service but only such\nnumber of cases of public servant shall be considered\naccording to the seniority, which shall be sufficient to cover\nthe number of existing and anticipated vacancies due to\nretirement during the year under each category. In addition\nto this, with a view of inclusion, in the select list, the names\nof two public servants or 25 percent of the number of the\npublic servants included in select list whichever is more,\nthe names of the required number of the public servants\nshall be considered for each category to fill up the\nunforeseen vacancies occurring during the course of the\naforesaid period.\n\nExplanation. - Manner of computation for eligibility for\npromotion. - Period of qualifying service on 1st January of\nthe relevant year in which Departmental Promotion\nCommittee is convened shall be counted from the calender\nyear in which the public servant has joined the feeding\ncadre/part of the service/pay scale of the post and not from\nthe date of joining of the cadre/part of the service/pay\nscale of post.\"\n\n34. Thus, from perusal of Rule 6(2) of the Rules, 2003, it is quite\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 38 of 53\n\nvivid that the select list should consist of 25% of number of\n\npublic servant for considering their case for anticipated\n\nvacancies. The petitioners have not disputed that they were\n\npromoted against anticipate vacancies arises on account of\n\npromotion of Assistant Engineers to Executive Engineers on\n\n19.09.2008, which clearly establishes that the petitioners were\n\nsubsequently promoted and not promoted when the private\n\nrespondents were promoted on 02.08.2008.\n\n35. It is well settled position of law that the promotion is not\n\nfundamental right but right to consider, is fundamental right,\n\ntherefore, the Government servant unless and until promoted,\n\nthey cannot claim the benefit arising out of the promotional posts\n\nincluding seniority as they will born in the cadre of Assistant\n\nEngineer when they are actually promoted.\n\n36. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case of\nAjay Kumar Shukla &\n\nothers Vs. Arvind Rai & others\nreported in (2022) 12 SCC 579,\n\nhas held as under:-\n\n\"41. This Court, time and again, has laid emphasis on right\nto be considered for promotion to be a fundamental right,\nas was held by K. Ramaswamy, J., in the case of\nDirector,\nLift Irrigation Corporation Ltd. and Others vs. Pravat Kiran\nMohanty and Others6\nin paragraph 4 of the report which is\nreproduced below:\n\n\"4... There is no fundamental right to promotion, but an\nemployee has only right to be considered for promotion,\nwhen it arises, in accordance with relevant rules. From this\nperspective in our view the conclusion of the High Court\nthat the gradation list prepared by the\ncorporation is in violation of the right of respondent/writ\npetitioner to equality enshrined under\nArticle 14\nread with\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 39 of 53\n\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution, and the respondent/writ\npetitioner was unjustly denied of the same is obviously\nunjustified.\"\n\n42. A Constitution Bench in case of\nAjit Singh vs. State of\nPunjab7\n, laying emphasis on\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle 16(1)\nof\nthe Constitution of India held that if a person who satisfies\nthe eligibility and the criteria for promotion but still is not\nconsidered for promotion, then there will be clear violation\nof his/her's fundamental right. Jagannadha Rao,J.\nspeaking for himself and Anand, CJI., Venkataswami,\nPattanaik, Kurdukar, JJ., observed the same as follows in\nparagraphs 21 and 22 and 27:\n\n\"21:\nArticles 14\nand\n16(1):\nis right to be considered for\npromotion a fundamental right 22:\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle\n16(1)\nare closely connected. They deal with individual\nrights of the person.\nArticle 14\ndemands that the \"State\nshall not deny to any person equality before the law or the\nequal protection of the laws\".\nArticle 16(1)\nissues a\npositive command that \"there shall be equality of\nopportunity for all citizens in matters relating to\nemployment or appointment to any office under the State\".\n\nIt has been held repeatedly by this Court that clause (1) of\n\nArticle 16\nis a facet of\nArticle 14\nand that it takes its roots\nfrom\nArticle 14.\nThe said clause particularises the\ngenerality in\nArticle 14\nand identifies, in a constitutional\nsense \"equality of opportunity in matters of employment\nand appointment to any office under the\nState. The word \"employment\" being wider, there is no\ndispute that it takes within its fold, the aspect of\npromotions to posts above the stage of initial level of\nrecruitment.\nArticle 16(1)\nprovides to every employee\notherwise eligible for promotion or who comes within the\nzone of consideration, a fundamental right to be\n\"considered\" for promotion. Equal opportunity here means\nthe right to be \"considered\" for promotion. If a person\nsatisfies the eligibility and zone criteria but\nis not considered for promotion, then there will be a clear\ninfraction of his fundamental right to be \"considered\" for\npromotion, which is his personal right.\n\n\"Promotion based on equal opportunity and seniority\nattached to such promotion are facets of fundamental right\nunder\nArticle 16(1).\n\nxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 40 of 53\n\n27. In our opinion, the above view expressed in Ashok\nKumar Gupta and followed in Jagdish Lal and other cases,\nif it is intended to lay down that the right guarantee to\nemployees for being \"considered\" for promotion according\nto relevant rules of recruitment by promotion (i.e. whether\non the basis of seniority or merit) is only a statutory right\nand not a fundamental right, we cannot accept the\nproposition. We have already stated earlier that the right to\nequal opportunity in the matter of promotion in the sense\nof a right to be \"considered\" for promotion is indeed a\nfundamental right guaranteed under\nArticle 16(1)\nand this\nhas never been doubted in any other case before Ashok\nKumar Gupta right from 1950.\"\n\n43. This Court in\nMajor General H.M. Singh, VSM vs. UOI\nand Another\n, again reiterated the legal position, i.e. right to\nbe considered for promotion as a fundamental right\nenshrined under\nArticle 14\nand\nArticle 16\nof the\nConstitution of India. The relevant extract from paragraph\n28 is reproduced below:\n\n\"28. The question that arises for consideration is, whether\nthe non-consideration of the claim of the appellant would\nviolate the fundamental rights vested in him under\nArticles\nand\nof the Constitution of India. The answer to the\naforesaid query would be in the affirmative, subject to the\ncondition that the respondents were desirous of filling the\nvacancy of Lieutenant-General, when it became available\non 1-1-2007. The factual position depicted in the counter-\naffidavit reveals that the respondents indeed were\ndesirous of filling up the said vacancy. In the above view of\nthe matter, if the appellant was the senior most serving\nMajor-General eligible for consideration (which he\nundoubtedly was), he most definitely had the fundamental\nright of being considered against the above vacancy, and\nalso the fundamental right of being promoted if he was\nadjudged suitable. Failing which, he would be deprived of\nhis fundamental right of equality before the law, and equal\nprotection of the laws, extended by\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution of India. We are of the view that it was in\norder to extend the benefit of the fundamental right\nenshrined under\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India, that\nhe was allowed extension in service on two occasions,\nfirstly by the Presidential Order dated 29-2-2008, and\nthereafter, by a further Presidential Order dated 30-5-\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 41 of 53\n\n2008. The above orders clearly depict that the aforesaid\nextension in service was granted to the appellant for a\nperiod of three months (and for a further period of one\nmonth), or till the approval of the ACC, whichever is\nearlier. By the aforesaid orders, the respondents desired\nto treat the appellant justly, so as to enable him to acquire\nthe honour of promotion to the rank of Lieutenant-General\n(in case the recommendation made in his favour by the\nSelection Board was approved by the Appointments\nCommittee of the Cabinet, stands affirmed). The action of\nthe authorities in depriving the appellant due consideration\nfor promotion to the rank of the Lieutenant-General would\nhave resulted in violation of his fundamental right under\n\nArticle 14\nof the Constitution of India. Such an action at\nthe hands of the respondents would unquestionably have\nbeen arbitrary.\"\n\n37. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in latest judgment in case of\n\nRavikumar Dhansukhlal Maheta & another [WPC No.\n\n432/2023, decided on 17.05.2024], has held that:-\n\n\"........in India, no government servant can claim\npromotion as their right because the Constitution does not\nprescribe criteria for filling seats in promotional posts. The\nLegislature or the executive may decide the method for\nfilling vacancies to promotional posts based on the nature\nof employment and the functions that the candidate will be\nexpected to discharge.The courts cannot sit in review to\ndecide whether the policy adopted for promotion is suited\nto select the 'best candidates', unless on the limited\nground where it violates the principle of equal opportunity\nunder\nArticle 16\nof the Constitution\".\n\n38. Thus, the submission that the petitioners are also entitled to get\n\nseniority from 02.08.2008 and they should be kept above the\n\nprivate respondents, is misconceived and deserves to be\n\nrejected. The further submission of the petitioner that the\n\npetitioners were granted seniority since 2011, which should not\n\nbe disturbed vide impugned order on account of long-standing\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 42 of 53\n\nand to substantiate this submission, the petitioner has referred to\n\nthe judgment of Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case of\nShiv\n\nCharan Singh Bhandari\n(supra), which is distinguishable on\n\nthe facts as\nin that case\nthe respondents have challenged the\n\nTribunal only after two decades when benefits of notional\n\npromotion from the date their juniors were granted promoted,\n\nwhich was not challenged within six years till regular promotion\n\nwas ordered whereas in the present case, the promotion from\n\nthe post of Assistant Engineer to further promotion has not taken\n\nplace and the petitioners and the respondents are still working\n\non the substantive post of Assistant Engineer.\n\n39. The record of the case by which the representation of the private\n\nrespondents has been considered, clearly demonstrates that the\n\nvarious representations raising objection were made and\n\naccordingly, a committee was constituted on 10.07.2020 and this\n\nCourt in WPS No. 3208/2020 has already recognized\n\nconstitution of committee and directed the committee to proceed\n\nin the matter. The committee so constituted after examining the\n\nfacts has passed the impugned order. The submission of learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners that there was delay and the private\n\nrespondents by accepting the seniority list from 2011 till passing\n\nof the impugned order, have accepted the same which should\n\nhave not been alter disadvantaged the petitioners cannot be\n\nconsidered.\n\n40. The petitioners were promoted on the cadre post of Assistant\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 43 of 53\n\nEngineer on 19.09.2008, therefore, as per Rule 12(1)(e) of the\n\nRules, 1961, the relative seniority between direct recruitees and\n\npromotees shall be determined according to the date of issuance\n\nof appointment/promotion order. It is undisputed facts that the\n\npetitioners were promoted on 19.09.2008 and the private\n\nrespondents who were directly appointee Assistant Engineers\n\nwere appointed on 02.08.2008, thus their seniority will be placed\n\nabove the petitioners. Even otherwise, it is not the case of the\n\npetitioners that they should be granted seniority as per Rule\n\n12(1)(d) of the Rules, 1961 as it is not their case that due to lack\n\nof any annual character role or for any other reasons, their\n\npromotion was delayed and subsequently they were found fit. In\n\nfact, the petitioners were promoted against the anticipated\n\nvacancies which has been made available on account of\n\npromotion of Assistant Engineer to the post of Executive\n\nEngineer on 19.09.2008. Thus, while granting seniority to the\n\npetitioners from 02.08.2008, the rules were wrongly applied,\n\nwhich has been corrected by the impugned order dated\n\n26.07.2023. As such, the impugned order does not warrant any\n\ninterference by this Court.\n\n41. Further submission of the petitioners that the long-standing\n\nseniority from 2011 should not be disturbed by the respondents.\n\nTo substantiate this submission, they have referred to the\n\njudgment rendered by Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case of\n\nShiva Shankar Mahapatra\n(supra), which has been considered\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 44 of 53\n\nby Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case of\nAjay Kumar Shukla\n\n(supra) wherein Hon'ble the Supreme Court in paragraph 23,\n\n24, 25 & 26 has held as under:-\n\n\"23. The Appointing Authority, in fact, committed an error in\nthe manner in which the seniority list was prepared by\nplacing the three select lists forwarded by the Commission\non different dates one after the other en bloc as per the\ndate of receipt of three select lists. It is not the case either\nof the private respondents, State or the Commission that\nappointment letters have been issued separately as and\nwhen the select lists were received. In fact, the\nappointment letters of all the three streams were issued in\nOctober 2001, after about 10 to 11 months of the receipt of\nthe third list i.e. of the Civil stream in November 2000.\nApparently by an oversight, the Appointing Authority failed\nto prepare the combined seniority list as required under\n1991 Seniority Rules, be it Rule 5 or Rule 8 with respect to\nthe selection of the appellants and private-respondents.\n\n24. We may now discuss the law on the point regarding\ndelay in approaching the court and in particular challenge\nto a seniority list. The learned Single Judge had placed\nreliance on a judgment of this Court in the case of\nShiba\nShankar Mohapatra vs. State of Orissa\n(supra). Dr. B.S.\nChauhan, J., after considering the question of entertaining\nthe petition despite long standing seniority filed at a belated\nstage discussed more than a dozen cases\non the point including Constitution Bench judgments and\nultimately in paragraph 30 observed that a seniority list\nwhich remains in existence for more than three to four\nyears unchallenged should not be disturbed. It is also\nrecorded in paragraph 30 that in case someone agitates\nthe issue of seniority beyond period of three to four years\nhe has to explain the delay and laches in approaching the\nadjudicatory forum by furnishing satisfactory explanation.\nParagraph 30 is reproduced below: -\n\n\"30. Thus in view of the above, the settled legal\nproposition that emerges is that once the seniority had\nbeen fixed and it remains in existence for a reasonable\nperiod, any challenge to the same should not be\nentertained.\nIn K.R. Mudgal, this Court has\nlaid down,\nin\ncrystal clear words that a seniority list which remains\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 45 of 53\n\nin existence for 3 to 4 years unchallenged, should not\nbe disturbed. Thus, 3-4 years is a reasonable period for\nchallenging the seniority and in case someone agitates\nthe issue of seniority beyond this period, he has to\nexplain the delay and laches in approaching the\nadjudicatory forum, by furnishing satisfactory\nexplanation.\"\n\n25. On the other hand, the Division Bench while shutting\nout the appellants on the ground of delay relied upon\nfollowing judgments of this Court.\n\n(\ni) Dayaram Asanand Gursahani vs. State of Maharashtra\nand others\n\n(\nii) B.S. Bajwa and another vs. State of Punjab and\nothers\n\n(\niii) Malcom Lawrence Cecil D'Souza vs. Union of India\nand others\n\n(\niv) R.S. Makashi and others vs. I.M. Menon and others\n\n26.\nIn the case of\nDayaram Asanand Gursahani\n(supra),\nthere was a delay of 9 years.\n\nIn the case of\nB.S. Bajwa\n\n(supra), there was a delay of more than a decade.\n\nIn\n\nMalcom Lawrence Cecil D'Souza\n(supra), the delay was of\n15 years and in\nR.S. Makashi\n(supra) there was a delay of 8\nyears. In all these cases, this court has recorded that the\ndelay has not been explained.\n\nShiba Shankar Mohapatra\n\n(Supra) is a judgment of 2010, which has laid down that,\nthree to four years would be a reasonable period to\nchallenge a seniority list and also that any challenge\nbeyond the aforesaid period would require satisfactory\nexplanation.\"\n\n42. The seniority was granted to the petitioners de-hors the Rules,\n\n1961, which have been framed by the State under\nArticle 309\nof\n\nthe Constitution of India and has binding effect, therefore, it is\n\nillegality and it is well settled position of law that the illegality\n\ncannot be allowed to perpetuate and the petitioners cannot take\n\nbenefits illegally on the count of long-standing seniority. This\n\nissue has come up for consideration before Hon'ble the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 46 of 53\n\nSupreme Court in case of\nPankjeshwar Sharma & others Vs.\n\nState of Jammu & Kashmir & others\nreported in (2021) 2 SCC\n\n188 wherein it has been held in paragraph 24, 35, 36 & 40 as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"24. It is a settled principle of service jurisprudence and\nhas been consistently followed by this Court that the rules\nof recruitment to various services under the State or to a\nclass of posts under the State, the State is bound to follow\nthe same and to have the selection of the candidates to be\nmade as per the scheme of recruitment rules and\nappointments shall be made accordingly. At the same time,\nall the efforts shall be made for strict adherence to the\nprocedure prescribed under the recruitment rules. On the\ncontrary, if any appointments are made bypassing the\nrecruitment procedure known to law, will resulted in\nviolation of\nArticle 14\nand\nof the Constitution. This Court\nin\nState of U.P. and Others vs. Rajkumar Sharma and\nOthers2\nand later in\nArup Das and Others vs. State of\nAssam and Others3\nconsidered the question of filling up of\nvacancies over and above the number of vacancies\nadvertised and held that the filling up of vacancies over\nand above the number of vacancies advertised would be\nviolative of fundamental rights guaranteed under\nArticle 14\n\nand\nof the Constitution and the selectees could not\nclaim appointments as a matter of right. This\nCourt further\nheld\nthat even if in some cases appointments had been\nmade erroneously or by mistake, that did not confer any\nright of appointment to another person as\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution does not envisage negative equality and if the\nState or its authority had committed a mistake at any given\nstage, it cannot be forced to perpetuate the said mistake\nunder the writ jurisdiction of the High Court under\nArticle\nof the Constitution.\n\nIn a situation where the posts in\nexcess of those advertised had been filled up in\nextraordinary circumstances, instead of invalidating the\nexcess appointments, the relief could be moulded in such\na manner so as to strike a just balance keeping the\ninterest of the State and the interest of the person 2\nState\nof U.P. and Others vs. Rajkumar Sharma and Others\n\n(2006) 3 SCC 330 3 Arup Das and Others vs. State of\nAssam and Others (2012) 5 SCC 559 seeking public\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 47 of 53\n\nemployment depends upon the facts of each case for\nwhich no set standard can be laid down.\n\n35. This Court in\nUnion of India and Another vs. Kartick\nChandra Mondal and Others5\nobserved that if something\nis being done or acted upon erroneously that cannot\nbecome the foundation for perpetuating further illegality. If\nan appointment is made illegally or irregularly, the same\ncannot be made the basis of further appointment and\nerroneous decision cannot be permitted to perpetuate\nfurther error to the detriment of the general welfare of the\npublic or a considerable section. This has been the\nconsistent approach of this Court.\n\n36.\nIn\nArup Das and Others vs. State of Assam and Others\n\n6, this Court observed that:\n\n\"19........even if in some cases appointments had been\nmade by mistake or wrongly, that did not confer any right\nof appointment to another person, as\nArticle 14\nof the\nConstitution does not envisage negative equality and if the\nState had committed a mistake, it cannot be forced to\nperpetuate the said mistake.\"\n\n40. We are also of the view that the appointments of 22\ncandidates made by the 2nd respondent vide orders dated\n23rd February, 2008 and 11th March, 2008 which has\ngiven rise to a further litigation are irregular appointments\nand not in conformity to the recruitment rules, still what\nbeing prayed by the appellants if accepted by this Court\nthat will perpetuate the illegality which has been committed\nby the Staterespondent and negative equality cannot be\nclaimed to perpetuate further illegality under\nArticle 226\nof\nthe Constitution of India.\"\n\n43. The petitioners have further submitted that without giving any\n\nopportunity of hearing, the impugned order has been passed, as\n\nsuch, it is violation of principle of natural justice and on this count\n\nalso, the same deserves to be quashed. This submission is\n\nincorrect submission as the facts regarding their promotion on\n\nthe post of Assistant Engineer, is known to them and issuance of\n\nnotice will be merely a formality and thus, the non-issuance of\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 48 of 53\n\nnotice to the petitioners does not vitiate the impugned order.\n\nHon'ble the Supreme Court has considered the issue where the\n\nissuance of notice is formality, it does not vitiate the action taken\n\nby the authorities. Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case of\n\nDharampal Satyapal Limited Vs. Deputy Commissioner of\n\nCentral Excise, Gauhati & others\n, reported in (2015) 8 SCC\n\n519 wherein it has been held in paragraph 39 to 41 as under:-\n\n\"39. We are not concerned with these aspects in the\npresent case as the issue relates to giving of notice before\ntaking action. While emphasizing that the principles of\nnatural justice cannot be applied in straight-jacket formula,\nthe aforesaid instances are given. We have highlighted the\njurisprudential basis of adhering to the principles of natural\njustice which are grounded on the doctrine of procedural\nfairness, accuracy of outcome leading to general social\ngoals, etc. Nevertheless, there may be situations wherein\nfor some reason - perhaps because the evidence against\nthe individual is thought to be utterly compelling - it is felt\nthat a fair hearing 'would make no difference' - meaning\nthat a hearing would not change the ultimate conclusion\nreached by the decision-maker - then no legal duty to\nsupply a hearing arises. Such an approach was endorsed\nby Lord Wilberforce in Malloch v. Aberdeen\nCorporation[20], who said that:\n\n\"...... A 'breach of procedure...cannot give (rise to) a\nremedy in the courts, unless behind it there is something of\nsubstance which has been lost by the failure. The court\ndos not act in vain'.\n\nRelying on these comments, Brandon LJ opined in\nCinnamond v. British Airports Authority that\n\".....no one can complain of not being given an opportunity\nto make representations if such an opportunity would have\navailed him nothing'. In such situations, fair procedures\nappear to serve no purpose since 'right' result can be\nsecured without according such treatment to the individual.\n\n40. In this behalf, we need to notice one other exception\nwhich has been carved out to the aforesaid principle by the\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 49 of 53\n\nCourts. Even if it is found by the Court that there is a\nviolation of principles of natural justice, the Courts have\nheld that it may not be necessary to strike down the action\nand refer the matter back to the authorities to take fresh\ndecision after complying with the procedural requirement in\nthose cases where non-grant of hearing has not caused\nany prejudice to the person against whom the action is\ntaken. Therefore, every violation of a facet of natural\njustice may not lead to the conclusion that order passed is\nalways null and void. The validity of the order has to be\ndecided on the touchstone of 'prejudice'. The ultimate test\nis always the same, viz., the test of prejudice or the test of\nfair hearing.\n\n41. In ECIL (supra), the majority opinion, penned down by\nSawant, J., while summing up the discussion and\nanswering the various questions posed, had to say as\nunder qua the prejudice principle:\n\n\"30. Hence the incidental questions raised above may be\nanswered as follows:\n\nxx xx xx\n\n(v) The next question to be answered is what is the effect\non the order of punishment when the report of the enquiry\nofficer is not furnished to the employee and what relief\nshould be granted to him in such cases. The answer to this\nquestion has to be relative to the punishment awarded.\n\nWhen the employee is dismissed or removed from service\nand the inquiry is set aside because the report is not\nfurnished to him, in some cases the non-furnishing of the\nreport may have prejudiced him gravely while in other\ncases it may have made no difference to the ultimate\npunishment awarded to him. Hence to direct reinstatement\nof the employee with back-wages in all cases is to reduce\nthe rules of justice to a mechanical ritual. The theory of\nreasonable opportunity and the principles of natural justice\nhave been evolved to uphold the rule of law and to assist\nthe individual to vindicate his just rights. They are not\nincantations to be invoked nor rites to be performed on all\nand sundry occasions. Whether in fact, prejudice has been\ncaused to the employee or not on account of the denial to\nhim of the report, has to be considered on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. Where, therefore, even after\nthe furnishing of the report, no different consequence\nwould have followed, it would be a perversion of justice to\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 50 of 53\n\npermit the employee to resume duty and to get all the\nconsequential benefits. It amounts to rewarding the\ndishonest and the guilty and thus to stretching the concept\nof justice to illogical and exasperating limits. It amounts to\nan \"unnatural expansion of natural justice\" which in itself is\nantithetical to justice.\"\n\n44. Thus, from the above discussions, considering the factual, legal\n\nmatrix of the case, it is quite vivid that the petitioners were taken\n\nbirth in the cadre of Assistant Engineer on 19.09.2008 whereas\n\nthe respondents have taken birth in the cadre on 02.08.2008\n\nafter having appointed as Assistant Engineer as such the\n\npetitioners prior to take born in the cadre, they cannot claim\n\nseniority over the private respondents. The word cadre has been\n\ncome up for consideration before Hon'ble the Supreme Court in\n\ncase of\nRan Singh Malik Vs. State of Haryana and others\n,\n\nreported in (2002) 3 SCC 182 wherein it has been held as\n\nunder:-\n\n\"The aforesaid Rule nowhere defined the cadre or\nindicated as to which post would be borne in the cadre. In\nthe absence of such definition of cadre in the Rule, the\nnormal connotation would apply, and therefore, a cadre\nwould ordinarily mean the strength of a service or a part of\nthe service so determined by the Government constituting\nthe post therein\".\n\n45. Again Hon'ble the Supreme Court has examined the definition of\n\ncadre in case of Union of India and others vs. Rubi\n\nMazumdar, reported in 2008 (9) SCC 242 wherein it has been\n\nheld in para 22 to 26 as under:-\n\n\"22. A conjoint reading of paragraph 103(7) of the Code,\n103(iii) of the Railway Establishment Manual and Circular\nR.B.E. No.113/97 makes it clear that in the railways, the\nterm `cadre' generally denotes the strength of a service or\na part of a service sanctioned as a separate unit.\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 51 of 53\n\nHowever, for the purpose of roster, a wider meaning has\nbeen given to the said term so as to take within its fold the\nposts sanctioned in different grades. The reason for giving\nthis enlarged meaning to the term \"cadre\" is that posts in\nthe railway establishment are sanctioned with reference to\ngrades. Even temporary, work charged, supernumerary\nand shadow posts created in different grades can\nconstitute part of the cadre.\n\n23. In the service jurisprudence which has developed in\nour country, no fixed meaning has been ascribed to the\nterm \"cadre\". In different service rules framed under\nproviso to\nArticle 309\nof the Constitution as also rules\nframed in exercise of the powers of delegated legislation,\nthe word \"cadre\" has been given different meaning.\n\n24.\nIn\nA.K. Subraman and Others vs. Union of India and\nOthers\n[1975 (1) SCC 319], a three Judges Bench of this\nCourt while interpreting the provisions contained in\nCentral Engineering Service, Class I, Recruitment Rules,\n1954, observed as under\n\n\"20.\"The word \"grade\" has various shades of meaning in\nthe service jurisprudence. It is sometimes used to denote\na pay scale and sometimes a cadre. Here it is obviously\nused in the sense of cadre. A cadre may consist only of\npermanent posts or sometimes, as is quite common these\ndays, also of temporary posts.\"\n\n25.\nIn\nDr. Chakradhar Paswan vs. State of Bihar and\nOthers\n[1988 (2) SCC 214] it was observed as under:-\n\n\"In service jurisprudence, the term `cadre' has a definite\nlegal connotation. It is not synonymous with `service'. It is\nopen to the Government to constitute as many cadres in\nany particular service as it may choose according to the\nadministrative convenience and expediency and it cannot\nbe said that the establishment of the Directorate\nconstituted the formation of a joint cadre of the Director\nand the Deputy Directors because the posts are not\ninterchangeable and the incumbents do not perform the\nsame duties, carry the same responsibilities or draw the\nsame pay. The posts of the Director and those of the\nDeputy Directors constitute different cadres of the Service.\nThe first vacancy in the cadre of Deputy Directors was that\nof the Deputy Director (Homoeopathic) and it had to be\ntreated as unreserved, the second reserved and the third\nunreserved. Therefore, for the first vacancy of the Deputy\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 52 of 53\n\nDirector (Homeopathic), a candidate belonging to the\nScheduled Caste had therefore to compete with others.\n\n26.\nIn\nState of Maharashtra vs. Purshottam and Others\n\n[1996 (9) SCC 266], it was held that the \"cadre\" means\nunit of strength of a service or a part of it as determined by\nthe employer\"\n\n46. Thereafter Hon'ble the Supreme Court has again examined the\n\nword \"Cadre\" in case of\nJarnail Singh and others Vs.\n\nLachhmi Narain Gupta and others\n, reported in (2022) 10 SCC\n\n595 has held in para 30 and 31 as under:-\n\n\"30. It would be relevant to refer to the judgments of this\nCourt which have dealt with the scope of the expression\n\"cadre\". Rule 4(2) of the Central Engineering Service,\nClass I, Recruitment Rules, 1954 provided that 75% of the\nvacancies in the grade of Executive Engineer, Class I\nshall be filled by promotion from Assistant Executive\nEngineers, Class I. Interpreting the words \"vacancies in\nthe grade of Executive Engineer\", this Court in\nA.K.\nSubraman & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors.\n13 held that the\nword \"grade\" is used in the sense of cadre.\n\n31. The dispute that arose for consideration of this Court\nin\nDr Chakradhar Paswan v. State of Bihar & Ors.\nrelates to the posts of Director and three Deputy Directors\nin the Directorate of Indigenous Medicines, Department of\nHealth, State of Bihar being grouped together for the\npurpose of implementing the 13 (1975) 1 SCC 319 14\n(1988) 2 SCC 214 34 | P a g e policy of reservation under\n\nArticle 16(4)\nof the Constitution of India. This Court was of\nthe opinion that though the Director and three Deputy\nDirectors are Class I posts, the posts of Director and\nDeputy Directors do not constitute one 'cadre'. It was held\nthat the term \"cadre\" has a definite legal connotation in\nservice jurisprudence. This Court referred to Fundamental\nRule 9(4) which defines the word \"cadre\" to mean the\nstrength of a service or part of a service sanctioned as a\nseparate unit. It was observed that as the post of Director\nis the highest post in the Directorate of Indigenous\nMedicines for which a higher pay scale is prescribed in\ncomparison to Deputy Directors, who are entitled to a\nlower scale of pay, they constitute two distinct cadres or\ngrades. This Court further expressed its view that it is\nopen to the Government to constitute as many cadres in\nany particular service as it may choose, according to\nadministrative convenience and expediency. This Court\nNeutral Citation\n2024:CGHC:22309\n\nPage 53 of 53\n\nconcluded that the post of Director and Deputy Directors\nconstitute different cadres in the service\".\n\n47. In view of the above finding, it is quite vivid that the petitioners\n\nwere granted seniority over the private respondents wrongly,\n\nwhich have been rightly corrected by the respondent/State vide\n\norder dated 26.07.2023, which does not warrant any interference\n\nby this Court.\n\n48. Accordingly, the Points emerged for determination, are answered\n\nagainst the petitioners and in favour of the State/private\n\nrespondents by recording its finding that the petitioners are not\n\nentitled to get seniority over private respondents and the\n\nimpugned order dated 26.07.2023 does not suffer from\n\nperversity or illegality, which warrants any interference from this\n\nCourt.\n\n49. The writ petitions sans merit are liable to be dismissed.\n\nAccordingly, they are dismissed. The interim order passed by\n\nthis Court stands vacated.\n\n50. The interlocutory application, if any, stands disposed of.\n\nSd/-\n\n(Narendra Kumar Vyas)\nJudge\n\nBhumika / Arun",
